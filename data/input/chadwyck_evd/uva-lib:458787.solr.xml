      <field name="fulltext">BYRON'S CONSPIRACIE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my Honorable and Constant friend, Sir Tho: Walsingham, Knight: and to my much loued from his birth, the right toward and worthy Gentleman his sonne Thomas Walsingham, Esquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologus. When the vnciuill, ciuill warres of France, Had pour'd vpon the countries beaten brest, Her batterd Citties; prest her vnder hils Of slaughterd carcases; set her in the mouthes Of murtherous breaches, and made pale Despaire, Leaue her to Ruine; through them all, Byron Stept to her rescue; tooke her by the hand: Pluckt her from vnder her vnnaturall presse, And set her shining in the height of peace. And now new clensd, from dust, from sweat, and bloud, And dignified with title of a Duke; As when in wealthy Autumne, his bright starre (Washt in the lofty Ocean) thence ariseth; Illustrates heauen, and all his other fires Out-shines and darkens; so admird Byron, All France, exempted from comparison. He toucht heauen with his lance; nor yet was toucht With hellish treacherie: his countries loue, He yet thirsts: not the faire shades of himselfe: Of which empoisoned Spring; when pollicie drinkes, He bursts in growing great; and rising, sinckes: Which now behold in our Conspirator, And see in his reuolt, how honors flood Ebbes into ayre, when men are Great, not Good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS 1. SCAENA 1. Sauoy, Roncas, Rochette, Breton. Sau. I would not for halfe Sauoy, but haue bound Fraunce to some fauour, by my personall presence More than your selfe, (my Lord Ambassadour) Could haue obtaind; for all Ambassadours (You know) haue chiefly these instructions; To note the State and chiefe sway of the Court, To which they are employde; to penetrate The heart, and marrow of the Kings designes, And to obserue the countenances and spirites, Of such as are impatient of rest; And wring beneath, some priuate discontent: But, past all these, there are a number more Of these State Critiscismes: That our personall view May profitably make, which cannot fall Within the powres of our instruction, To make you comprehend; I will doe more With my meere shadow, than you with your persons. All you can say against my comming heere, Is that, which I confesse, may for the time, Breede strange affections in my brother Spaine; But when I shal haue time to make my Cannans, The long-tong'd Heraulds of my hidden drifts, Our reconcilement will be made with triumphs. Ron. If not, your Highnesse hath small cause to care, Hauing such worthy reason to complaine Of Spaines colde friendship, and his lingring succours, Who onely entertaines your griefes with hope, To make your medcine desperate. Roch. My Lord knowes The Spanish glosse too well; his forme, stuffe lasting, And the most dangerous conditions, He layes on them with whome he is in league. Th'iniustice in the most vnequall dowre, Giuen with th'Infanta whome my Lord espousde, Compar'd with that her elder sister had, May tell him how much Spaines loue weighs to him; When of so many Globes and Scepters held By the great King, he onely would bestow A portion but of six score thousand Crownes In yeerely pension, with his highnesse wife, When the Infanta wedded by the Archduke Had the Franch County, and lowe Prouinces. Bret. We should not set these passages of Splene Twixt Spaine and Sauoy; to the weaker part, More good by suffrance growes, than deedes of heart, The nearer Princes are, the further off In rites of friendship; my aduice had neuer Consented to this voyage of my Lord, In which he doth endaunger Spaines whole losse, For hope of some poore fragment heere in Fraunce. Sau. My hope in France you know not, though my counsel, And for my losse of Spaine, it is agreede, That I should sleight it, oft-times Princes rules Are like the Chymicall Philosophers; Leaue me then to mine owne proiection, In this our thriftie Alchymie of state, Yet helpe me thus farre, you that haue beene heere Our Lord Ambassadour; and, in short informe mee, What Spirites here are fit for our designes. Ron. The new-created Duke Byron is fit, Were there no other reason for your presence, To make it worthie; for he is a man Of matchlesse valure, and was euer happy In all encounters, which were still made good, With an vnwearyed sence of any toyle, Hauing continewd fourteene dayes together Vpon his horse; his blood is not voluptuous, Nor much inclinde to women; his desires Are higher than his state and his deserts Not much short of the most he can desire, If they be weigh'd with what Fraunce feeles by them: He is past measure glorious: And that humour Is fit to feede his Spirites, whome it possesseth With faith in any errour; chiefly where Men blowe it vp, with praise of his perfections, The taste whereof in him so soothes his pallate, And takes vp all his appetite that oft times He will refuse his meate, and companie To feast alone with their most strong conceit; Ambition also, cheeke by cheeke doth march With that excesse of glory, both sustaind With an vnlimited fancie, That the King, Nor Fraunce itselfe, without him can subsist. Sau. He is the man (my Lord) I come to winne: And that supreame intention of my presence Saw neuer light till now, which yet I feare, The politike king, suspecting, is the cause That he hath sent him so farre from my reach, And made him chiefe in the Commission, Of his ambassage to my brother Arch-duke, With whome he is now; and (as I am tolde) So entertaind and fitted in his humour, That ere I part, I hope he will returne Prepar'd, and made the more fit for the phisicke That I intend to minister. Ron. My Lord, There is another discontented Spirite Now heere in Court, that for his braine, and aptnes To any course that may recouer him In his declined and litigious state, Will serue Byron, as he were made for him, In giuing vent to his ambitious vaine, And that is, De Lassin. Sau. You tell me true, And him I thinke you haue prepar'd for me. Ron. I haue my Lord, and doubt not he will prooue, Of the yet taintlesse fortresse of Byron, A quicke Expugner, and a strong Abider. Sau. Perhappes the battry will be brought before him, In this ambassage, for I am assur'd They set high price of him, and are informde Of all the passages, and means for mines That may be thought on, to his taking in: Enter Henry and Laffin. The King comes, and Laffin: the Kings aspect Folded in cloudes. Hen. I will not haue my traine, Made a retreite for Bankroutes, nor my Court, A hyue for Droanes: prowde Beggars, and true Thieues, That with a forced truth they sweare to me, Robbe my poore subiects, shall giue vp their Arts, And hencefoorth learne to liue by their desarts; Though I am growne, by right of Birth and Armes Into a greater kingdome, I will spreade With no more shade, then may admit that kingdome Her proper, naturall, and woonted fruites, Nauarre shall be Nauarre, and France still France: If one may be the better for the other By mutuall rites, so, neither shall be worse. Thou arte in lawe, in quarrells, and in debt, Which thou wouldst quit with countnaunce; Borrowing With thee is purchase, and thou seekst by me (In my supportance) now our olde warres cease To wage worse battells, with the armes of Peace. Laf. Peace must not make men Cowherds, nor keepe calme Her pursie regiment with mens smootherd breaths; I must confesse my fortunes are declinde, But neither my deseruings, nor my minde: I seeke but to sustaine the right I found, When I was rich, in keeping what is left, And making good my honour as at best, Though it be hard; mans right to euerything Wanes with his wealth, wealth is his surest King; Yet Iustice should be still indifferent. The ouerplus of Kings, in all their might, Is but to peece out the defects of right: And this I sue for, nor shall frownes and taunts (The common Scarre-crowes of all poore mens suites) Nor mis-construction that doth colour still Licentiate Iustice, punishing good for ill, Keepe my free throate from knocking at the Skie, If thunder chid mee for my equitie. Hen. Thy equity, is to be euer banisht From Court, and all societie of noblesse, Amongst whome thou throwst balls of all dissention; Thou arte at peace with nothing but with warre, Hast no heart but to hurt, and eatst thy heart, If it but thinke of doing any good: Thou witchest with thy smiles, suckst bloud with praises, Mock'st al humanitie; society poisonst; Coosinst with vertue; with religion Betrayst, and massacrest; so vile thy selfe, That thou suspectst perfection in others: A man must thinke of all the villanies He knowes in all men, to descipher thee, That art the centre to impietie: Away, and tempt me not. Laf. But you tempt me, To what, thou Sunne be iudge, and make him see. Exit. Sau. Now by my dearest Marquisate of Salusses, Your Maiestie hath with the greatest life Describ'd a wicked man; or rather thrust Your arme downe through him to his very feete, And pluckt his inside out, that euer yet, Mine eares did witnesse; or turnd eares to Eies; And those strange Characters, writ in his face, which' at first sight, were hard for me to reade, The Doctrine of your speech, hath made so plaine, That I run through them like my naturall language: Nor do I like that mans Aspect, me thinkes, Of all lookes where the Beames of Starres haue caru'd Their powrefull influences; And (O rare) What an heroicke, more than royall Spirite Bewraide you in your first speech, that defies Protection of vile droanes, that eate the honny Swette from laborious vertue, and denies To giue those of Nauarre, though bred with you, The benefites and dignities of Fraunce. When little Riuers by their greedy currants, (Farre farre extended from their mother springs) Drinke vp the forraine brookes still as they runne, And force their greatnesse, when they come to Sea, And iustle with the Ocean for a roome, O how he roares, and takes them in his mouth, Digesting them so to his proper streames, That they are no more seene, hee nothing raisde Aboue his vsuall bounds, yet they deuour'd, That of themselues were pleasant, goodly flouds. Hen. I would doe best for both, yet shall not be secure, Till in some absolute heires my Crowne be setled, There is so little now betwixt Aspirers And their great obiect in my onely selfe, That all the strength they gather vnder me, Tempts combate with mine owne: I therefore make Meanes for some issue by my marriage, Which with the great Dukes neece is now concluded, And she is comming; I haue trust in heauen I am not yet so olde, but I may spring, And then I hope all traitrous hopes will fade. Sau. Else may their whole estates flie, rooted vp To Ignominie and Obliuion: And (being your neighbor seruant, and poore kinsman) I wish your mighty Race might multiply, Euen to the Period of all Emperie. Hen. Thankes to my princely coozen, this your loue And honour shewne me in your personall presence, I wish to welcome to your full content: The peace I now make with your brother Archduke, By Duke Byron our Lord Ambassadour, I wish may happily extend to you, And that at his returne we may conclude it. Sau. It shall be to my heart the happiest day Of all my life, and that life all employd, To celebrate the honour of that day. Exeunt. Enter Roiseau. Rois. The wondrous honour doone our Duke Byron In his Ambassage heere, in th'Archdukes Court, I feare will taint his loyaltie to our King, I will obserue how they obserue his humour, And glorifie his valure; and how he Accepts and stands attractiue to their ends, That so I may not seeme an idle spot In traine of this ambassage, but returne Able to giue our King some note of all, Worth my attendance; And see, heere's the man, Who (though a French man, and in Orleance borne Seruing the Arch-duke) I doe most suspect, Is set to be the tempter of our Duke; Ile goe where I may see, all though not heare. Enter PicotÃ©, with two other spreading a Carpet. Pic. Spreade heere this historie of Cateline, That Earth may seeme to bring forth Roman Spirites; Euen to his Geniall feete; and her darke breast Be made the cleare Glasse of his shining Graces, Weele make his feete so tender, they shall gall In all paths but to Empire; and therein Ile make the sweete Steppes of his State beginne. Exit. Lowde Musique, and enter Byron. Byr. What place is this? what ayre? what rhegion? In which a man may heare the harmony Of all things moouing? Hymen marries heere, Their ends and vses and makes me his Temple. Hath any man beene blessed, and yet liu'd? The bloud turnes in my veines, I stand on change, And shall dissolue in changing; tis so full Of pleasure not to be containde in flesh: To feare a violent Good, abuseth Goodnes, Tis Immortallitie to die aspiring, As if a man were taken quicke to heauen; What will not holde Perfection, let it burst; What force hath any Cannan, not being chargde, Or being not dischargde? To haue stuffe and forme, And to lie idle, fearefull, and vnus'd, Nor forme, nor stuffe shewes; happy Semele That died comprest with Glorie: Happinesse Denies comparison, of lesse, or more, And not at most, is nothing: like the shaft Shot at the Sunne, by angry Hercules, And into shiuers by the thunder broken Will I be if I burst: And in my heart This shall be written: yet twas high and right. Musique againe. Heere too? they follow all my steppes with Musique, As if my feete were numerous, and trode sounds Out of the Center, with Apolloes vertue, That out of euery thing his ech-part toucht, Strooke musicall accents: wheresoe're I goe, They hide the earth from me with couerings rich, To make me thinke that I am heere in heauen. Enter Picote in haste. Pic. This way, your Highnesse. Byr. Come they? Pic. I my Lord. Exeunt. Enter the other Commissioners of Fraunce, Belieure, Bruhart, Aumall, Orenge. Bel. My Lord d' Aumall, I am exceeding sorie, That your owne obstinacie to hold out, Your mortall enmitie against the King, When Duke du Maine, and all the faction yeelded, Should force his wrath to vse the rites of treason, Vpon the members of your sencelesse Statue, Your Name and House, when he had lost your person, Your loue and duety. Bru. That which men enforce By their owne wilfulnesse; they must endure With willing patience, and without complaint. D' Aum. I vse not much impatience nor complaint, Though it offends me much, to haue my name So blotted with addition of a Traitor. And my whole memory, (with such despight, Markt and begun to be so rooted out.) Bru. It was despight that held you out so long, Whose penance in the King was needfull iustice. Bel. Come let vs seeke our Duke, and take our leaues Of th'Archdukes grace. Exeunt. Enter Byron and PycotÃ¨. Byr. Here may we safely breathe? Py. No doubt (my Lord) no stranger knowes this way; One y the Arch-duke, and your friend Count Mansfield, Perhaps may make their generall scapes to you, To vtter some part of their priuate loues, Ere your departure. Byr. Then, I well perceiue To what th'intention of his highnesse tends; For whose, and others here, most worthy Lords, I will become (with all my worth) their seruant, In any office, but disloyaltie; But that hath euer showd so fowle a monster To all my Ancestors, and my former life, That now to entertaine it; I must wholy Giue vp my habite, in his contrary, And striue to growe out of priuation. Py. My Lord, to weare your loyall habite still, When it is out of fashion; and hath done Seruice enough; were rusticke miserie: The habite of a seruile loyaltie, Is reckond now amongst priuations. With blindnesse, dumbnesse, deafnesse, scilence, death, All which are neither natures by themselues Nor substances, but mere decayes of forme, And absolute decessions of nature, And so, 'tis nothing, what shall you then loose? Your highnesse hath a habite in perfection, And in desert of highest dignities, Which carue your selfe, and be your owne rewarder; No true powre doth admit priuation, Aduerse to him; or suffers any fellow Ioynde in his subiect; you, superiors; It is the nature of things absolute. One to destroy another; be your Highnesse, Like those steepe hils that will admit no clowds, No deawes, nor left fumes bound about their browes; Because their tops pierce into purest ayre, Expert of humor; or like ayre it selfe That quickly changeth; and receiues the sunne Soone as he riseth; euery where dispersing His royall splendor; guirds it in his beames, And makes it selfe the body of the light; Hote, shining, swift, light, and aspiring things, Are of immortall, and celestiall nature; Colde, darke, dull, heauie of infernall fortunes, And neuer aime at any happinesse: Your excellencie knowes; that simple loyaltie, Faith, loue, sinceritie, are but words, no things; Meerely deuisde for forme; and as the Legate, Sent from his Holinesse, to frame a peace Twixt Spaine and Sauoy; labour'd feruently, (For common ends, not for the Dukes perticular) To haue him signe it; he againe endeuours (Not for the Legates paines, but his owne pleasure) To gratifie him; and being at last encountred; Where the flood Tesyn enters into Po, They made a kinde contention, which of them Should enter th'others boate; one thrust the other: One legge was ouer, and another in: And with a fierie courtesie, at last Sauoy leapes out, into the Legates armes, And here ends all his loue, and th'others labour; So shall these termes, and impositions Exprest before, hold nothing in themselues Really good; but florishes of forme: And further then they make to priuate ends None wise, or free, their propper vse intends. Byr. O 'tis a dangerous, and a dreadfull thing To steale prey from a Lyon; or to hide A head distrustfull, in his opened iawes; To trust our bloud in others veines; and hang Twixt heauen and earth, in vapors of their breaths: To leaue a sure pace on continuate earth, And force a gate in iumps, from towre to towre, As they doe that aspire, from height to height; The bounds of loyaltie are made of glasse, Soone broke, but can in no date be repaird; And as the Duke D' Aumall, (now here in Court) Flying his countrey; had his Statue to me Peece-meale with horses; all his goods confiscate, His Armes of honor, kickt about the streetes, His goodly house at Annet rac'd to th'earth. And (for a strange reproche of his foule treason) His trees about it, cut off by their wastes; So, when men flie the naturall clime of truth, And turne them-selues loose, out of all the bounds Of Iustice, and the straight-way to their ends; Forsaking all the sure force in themselues To seeke, without them, that which is not theirs, The formes of all their comforts are distracted; The riches of their freedomes forfaited; Their humaine noblesse shamd; the Mansions Of their colde spirits, eaten downe with Cares; And all their ornaments, of wit, and valure, Learning, and iudgement, cut from all their fruites. Alb. O, here were now the richest prize in Europe, Were he but taken in affection, Would we might growe together, and be twins Of eithers fortune; or that, still embrac't I were, but Ring to such a pretious stone: Byr. Your highnesse honors, and high bountie showne me, Haue wonne from me, my voluntary powre; And I must now mooue by your eminent will; To what particular obiects; if I know By this mans intercession, he shall bring: My vttermost answere, and performe betwixt vs, Reciprocall and full intelligence. Alber. Euen for your owne deserued roiall good, Tis ioyfully accepted, vse the loues And worthy admirations of your friends, That beget vowes of all things you can wish, And be what I wish: danger saies, no more. Exit. Enter Mansfield at another dore. Exit PicotÃ©. Mans. Your highnesse makes the light of this Court stoope, With your so neere departure, I was forc't To tender to your excellence, in briefe, This priuate wish in taking of my leaue; That in some army Roiall, old Cont Mansfield, Might be commanded by your matchles valor, To the supreamest point of victorie: Who vowes for that renowne all praier, and seruice: No more least I may wrong you. Exit Mans. Byr. Thanke your Lordship. Enter D' Aumall and Oreng. D' Au. All maiestie be added to your highnesse, Of which, I would not wish your brest to beare More modest apprehension: then may tread, The high gate of your spirit; and be knowne To be a fit Bound for your Boundlesse valor; Or. So Oreng wisheth, and to the desarts Of your great actions, their most roiall Crowne. Enter PicotÃ©. Pic. Away my Lord, the Lords enquire for you. Exit Bir. Manet Oreng, D' Aum. Roiseau. Ore. Would we might winne his valor to our part. D' Au. Tis well prepar'd in his entreaty here; With all states highest obseruations: And to their forme, and words are added gifts, He was presented with two goodly horses, One of which two, was the braue Beast Pastrana: With plate of gold, and a much prized iewell; Girdle and hangers, set with welthy stones: All which were vallewed, at ten thousand crownes; The other Lords had suites of tapistry, And chaines of gold, and euery gentleman A paire of Spanish Gloues, and Rapire blades: And here ends their entreaty; which I hope Is the beginning of more good to vs, Then twenty thousand times their giftes to them. Enter Alber: Byr: Beli. Mans: Roiseau: with others. Alber. My Lord, I grieue that all the setting forth, Of our best welcome, made you more retired: Your chamber hath beene more lou'd then our honors; And therefore we are glad your time of parting Is come to set you in the ayre you loue: Commend my seruice to his Maiesty, And tell him that this daie of peace with him Ile hold, as holie. All your paines my Lords I shalbe alwaies glad to gratefie With any loue and honour, your owne hearts Shall do me grace to wish exprest to you. Ruis. Here hath beene strange demeaneure, which shall flie, To the great author of this Ambassy. FINIS Actus 1.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. 2. SCE. 1. Sauoy, Laffin, Roncas, Rochette, Breton. Sauoy. Admit no entry, I will speake with none, Good signior de Laffin, your worth shall finde, That I will make a iewell for my cabinet, Or that the King (in surfet of his store) Hath cast out, as the sweepings of his hall; I told him, hauing threatned you away, That I did wonder, this small time of peace, Could make him cast his armor so securely In such as you, and as twere set the head Of one so great in counsailes, on his foote, And pitch him from him with such guardlike strength. Laffi. He may perhaps finde he hath pitcht away, The Axeltree that kept him on his wheeles. Sau. I told him so, I sweare, in other termes And not with too much note of our close loues Least so he might haue smokt our practises. Laffi. To chuse his time, and spit his poison on me, Through th'eares, and eies of strangers. Sau. So I told him And more then that, which now I will not tell you: It rests now then, Noble, and worthy friend, That to our friendship, we draw Duke Byron, To whose attraction there is no such chaine, As you can fordge, and shake out of your braine. Laffi. I haue deuisde the fashion and the weight; To valures hard to draw, we vse retreates; And, to pull shaftes home, (with a good bow-arme) We thrust hard from vs: since he came from Flanders He heard how I was threatned with the King, And hath beene much inquisitiue to know The truth of all, and seekes to speake with me; The meanes he vsde, I answerd doubtfully; And with an intimation that I shund him, Which will (I know) put more spur to his charge; And if his haughty stomacke be preparde. With will to any act: for the aspiring Of his ambitious aimes, I make no doubt But I shall worke with him to your highnesse wish. Sau. But vndertake it, and I rest assur'd: You are reported to haue skill in Magick, And the euents of things, at which they reach That are in nature apt to ouerreach: Whom the whole circkle of the present time, In present pleasures, fortunes, knowledges, Can not containe: those men (as broken loose From humaine limmits) in all violent ends Would faine aspire the faculties of fiends, And in such ayre breathe his vnbounded spirits, Which therefore well will fit such coniurations, Attempt him then by flying; close with him, And bring him home to vs, and take my dukedome. Laf. My best in that, and all things, vowes your seruice. Sau. Thankes to my deare friend; and the French Vlisses. Exit Sauoy. Enter Byron. Byr. Here is the man; my honord friend, Laffin? Alone, and heauy countinanc't? on what termes Stood th'insultation of the King vpon you? Laffi. Why do you aske? Byr. Since I would know the truth. Laf. And when you know it; what? Byr. Ile iudge betwixt you, And (as I may) make euen th'excesse of either. Laf. Ah las my Lord, not all your loyaltie, Which is in you, more then hereditary, Nor all your valure (which is more then humane) Can do the seruice you may hope on me In sounding my displeasde integrity; Stand for the King, as much in policie As you haue stird for him in deeds of armes, And make your selfe his glorie, and your countries Till you bee suckt as drie, and wrought as leane, As my fleade carcase: you shall neuer close With me, as you imagine. Byr. You much wrong me, To thinke me an intelligencing Lord. Laff. I know not now your so affected zeale, To be reputed a true harted subiect, May stretch or turne you; I am desperate; If I offend you, I am in your powre: I care not how I tempt your conquering furie, I am predestin'd to too base an end, To haue the honor of your wrath destroy me; And be a worthy obiect for your sword: I lay my hand, and head too at your feete, As I haue euer, here I hold it still, End me directly, doe not goe about. Byr. How strange is this? the shame of his disgrace Hath made him lunatique. Laff. Since the King hath wrong'd me He thinkes Ile hurt my selfe; no, no, my Lord: I know that all the Kings in Christendome, (If they should ioyne in my reuenge) wou'd proue Weake foes to him: still hauing you to friend: If you were gone (I care not if you tell him) I might be tempted then to right my selfe. Exit. Byr. He has a will to me, and dares not shew it, His state decai'd, and he disgrac'd; distracts him. Redit Laffin. Laff. Charge not my words my Lord, I onely said I might be tempted then to right my selfe: Temptation to treason, is no treason; And that word (tempted) was conditionall too, If you were gone, I pray informe the truth. Exitur. Byr. Stay iniur'd man, and know I am your friend, Farre from these base, and mercenarie reaches, I am I sweare to you. Laff. You may be so; And yet youle giue me leaue to be Laffin, A poore and expuate humor of the Court: But what good bloud came out with me; what veines And sinews of the Triumphs, now it makes; I list not vante; yet will I now confesse, And dare assume it; I haue powre to adde To all his greatnesse; and make yet more fixt His bould securitie; Tell him this my Lord; And this (if all the spirits of earth and aire, Be able to enforce) I can make good: If knowledge of the sure euents of things, Euen from the rise of subiects into Kings: And falles of Kings to subiects hold a powre Of strength to worke it; I can make it good; And tell him this to; if in midest of winter To make black Groues grow greene; to still the thunder; And cast out able flashes from mine eies, To beate the lightning back into the skies, Proue powre to do it, I can make it good, And tell him this too; if to lift the Sea Vp to the Starres, when all the Winde are still; And keepe it calme, when they are most enrag'd: To make earths driest pallms, sweate humorous springs To make fixt rocks walke; and loose shadowes stand, To make the dead speake. midnight see the Sunne, Mid-daie turne mid-night; to dissolue all lawes Of nature, and of order, argue powre Able to worke all, I can make all good, And all this tell the King. Byr. Tis more then strange, To see you stand thus at the rapiers point With one so kinde and sure a friend as I. Laff. Who cannot friend himselfe, is foe to any, And to be fear'd of all, and that is it, Makes me so skornd, but make me what you can; Neuer so wicked, and so full of feends, I neuer yet, was traitor to my friends: The lawes of friendship I haue euer held, As my religion; and for other lawes; He is a foole that keepes them with more care, Then they keepe him, safe, rich, and populare: For riches, and for populare respects Take them amongst yee Minions, but for safety, You shall not finde the least flaw in mine armes, To pierce or taint me; what will great men be, To please the King, and beare authoritie. Exit. Byr. How sit a sort were this to hansell fortune? And I will winne it though I loose my selfe, Though he prooue harder then Egiptian Marble, Ile make him malliable, as th'Ophyr gold; I am put off from this dull shore of East, Into industrious, and high-going Seas; Where like Pelides in Scamanders flood, Vp to the eares in surges, I will fight, And pluck French Ilion vnderneath the waues; If to be highest still, be to be best, All workes to that end are the worthiest: Truth is a golden Ball, cast in our way, To make vs stript by falsehood: And as Spaine When the hote scuffles of Barbarian armes, Smotherd the life of Don Sebastian, To guild the leaden rumor of his death Gaue for a slaughterd body (held for his) A hundred thousand crownes; causd all the state Of superstitious Portugall to mourne And celebrate his solemne funerals; The Moores to conquest, thankfull feasts preferre, And all made with the carcasse of a Switzer: So in the Giantlike, and politique warres Of barbarous greatnesse, raging still in peace, Showes to aspire iust obiects; are laide on With cost, with labour, and with forme enough, Which onely makes our best acts brooke the light, And their ends had, we thinke we haue their right, So wurst workes are made good, with good successe, And so for Kings, pay subiects carcases. Exit. Enter Henry, Roisieau. Hen. Was he so courted? Rois. As a Cittie Dame, Brought by her iealous husband, to the Court, Some elder Courtiers entertaining him, While others snatch, a fauour from his wife: One starts from this doore; from that nooke another, With gifts, and iunkets, and with printed phrase, Steale her employment, shifting place by place Still as her husband comes: so Duke Byron Was woode, and worshipt in the Arch-dukes Court, And as th'assistants that your Maiestie, Ioinde in Commission with him, or my selfe, Or any other doubted eye appear'd, He euer vanisht: and as such a dame, As we compar'd with him before, being wun To breake faith to her husband, loose her fame, Staine both their progenies, and comming fresh From vnderneath the burthen of her shame, Visits her husband with as chaste a browe, As temperate, and confirm'd behauiour, As she came quitted from confession. So from his scapes, would he present a presence, The practise of his state adulterie, And guilt that should a gracefull bosome stricke, Drownde in the set lake, of a hopelesse cheeke. Hen. It may be hee dissembled, or suppose, He be a little tainted: men whom vertue Formes with the stuffe of fortune great, and gratious, Must needs pertake with fortune in her humor Of instabilitie: and are like to shafts Growne crookt with standing, which to rectifie, Must twice as much be bowd another way, He that hath borne wounds for his worthy parts, Must for his wurst be borne with: we must fit Our gouernment to men, as men to it: In old time, they that hunted sauadge beasts, Are said to clothe themselues in sauage skinnes, They that were Fowlers when they went on fowling, Wore garments made with wings resembling Fowles: To Buls, we must not shew our selues in red, Nor to the warlick Elephant in white, In all things gouern'd, their infirmities Must not be stird, nor wrought on; Duke Byron Flowes with adust, and melancholy choller, And melancholy spirits are venemous: Not to be toucht, but as they may be cur'de: I therefore meane to make him change the ayre, And send him further from those Spanish vapors, That still beare fighting sulphure in their brests, To breath a while in temperate English ayre, Where lips are spyed with free and loyall counsailes, Where policies are not ruinous, but sauing; Wisdome is simple, valure righteous. Humaine, and hating facts of brutish forces And whose graue natures, scorne the scoffes of France, The empty complements of Italy, The any-way encroching pride of Spaine, And louc men modest, harty, iust and plaine. Sauoy, whispering with Laffin. Sau. Ile sound him for Byron; and what I finde, In the Kings depth; ile draw vp, and informe, In excitations to the Dukes reuolt, When next I meete with him. Laff. It must be done With praising of the Duke; from whom the king Will take to giue himselfe; which tolde the Duke, Will take his heart vp into all ambition. Sau. I know it (politick friend:) and tis my purpose, Exit Laf. Your Maiestie hath mist a royall sight, The Duke Byron, on his braue beast Pastrana, Who sits him like a full-saild Argosea, Danc'd with a lofty billow, and as snug Plyes to his bearer, both their motions mixt; And being considerd in their site together, They do the best present the state of man, In his first royaltie ruling; and of beasts In their first loyaltie seruing; one commanding, And no way being mou'd; the other seruing, And no way being compeld; of all the sights That euer my eyes witnest; and they make A doctrinall and witty Hierogliphick, Or a blest kingdome: to expresse and teach, Kings to command as they could serue, and subiects To serue as if they had powre to command. Hen. You are a good old horseman I perceiue, And still out all the vse of that good part: Your wit is of the true Pierean spring, That can make any thing, of any thing. Sau. So braue a subiect as the Duke, no king Seated on earth, can vante of but your Highnesse, So valiant, loyall, and so great in seruice. Hen. No question he sets valour in his height, And hath done seruice to an equall pitche, Fortune attending him with fit euents, To all his ventrous and well-laid attempts. Sau. Fortune? to him was Iuno, to Alcides, For when, or where did she but open way, To any act of his? what stone tooke he With her helpe or without his owne lost bloud? What fort wan he by her? or was not forc't? What victory but gainst ods? on what Commander Sleepy or negligent, did he euer charge? What Summer euer made she faire to him? What winter, not of one continued storme? Fortune is so farre from his Creditresse, That she owes him much; for in him, her lookes Are louely, modest, and magnanimous, Constant, victorious and in his Achieuments, Her cheekes are drawne out with a vertuous rednesse, Out of his eager spirit to victorie, And chast contention to conuince with honor; And (I haue heard) his spirits haue stowd so high, In all his conflicts against any odds, That (in his charde) his lips haue bled with feruor: How seru'd he at your famous siege of Dreux? Where the enemie (assur'd of victory) Drew out a bodie of foure thousand horse, And twice sixe thousand foote, and like a Crescent, Stood for the signall, you: (that show'd your selfe A sound old souldiar) thinking it not fit To giue your enemy the ods and honour Of the first stroke, commanded de la Guiche, To let fue all his cannans, that did pierse The aduerse thickest squadrons and had shot Nine volleies ere the foe had once giuen fire: Your troope was charg'd, and when your dukes old father, Met with th'assailants, and their Groue of Reiters Repulst so fiercely, made them turne their beards And rallie vp themselues behind their troopes; Fresh forces seeing your troopes a little seuerd, From that part first assaulted, gaue it charge, Which then, this duke made good seconds his father, Beates through and through the enemies greatest strength, And breakes the rest like Billowes gainst a rock And there the heart of that huge battaile broke. Hen. The heart but now came on, in that stronge body, Of twice two thousand horse, lead by Du Maine Which (if I would be glorious) I could say I first encountred. Sau. How did he take in, Beaune in view of that inuincible army Lead by the Lord great Constable of Castile? Autun, and Nuis: in Burgundy chast away, Vicount Tauannes troopes before Dijon, And puts himselfe in, and there that was won. Hen. If you would onely giue me leaue my Lord, I would do right to him, yet must not giue. Sau. A league from Fountaine Francois, when you sent him, To make discouerie of the Castile army, When he descern'd twas it (with wondrous wisdome Ioinde to his spirit) he seem'd to make retreate, But when they prest him, and the Barron of Lux, Set on their charge so hotely, that his horse, Was slaine, and he most dangerously engag'd, Then turnd your braue duke head, and (with such ease As doth an Eccho beate backe violent sounds, With their owne forces) he, (as if a wall Start sodainely before them) pasht them all Flat, at the earth, and there was that field wonne. Hen. Y' are all the field wide. Sau. O, I aske you pardon, The strength of that field yet laie in his backe, Vpon the foes part; and what is to come, Of this your Marshal, now your worthie Duke Is much beyond the rest: for now he sees A sort of horse troopes, issue from the woods, In number nere twelue hunderd: and retyring To tell you that the entire armie follow'd, Before he could relate it, he was forc't To turne head, and receiue the maine assaulte Of fiue horse troopes: onely with twenty horse: The first he met, he tumbled to the earth, And brake through all, not daunted with two wounds, One on his head, another on his brest, The bloud of which, drownd all the field in doubte: Your maiesty himselfe was then engag'd, Your powre not yet arriu'd, and vp you brought The little strength you had: a cloud of foes, Ready to burst in stormes about your eares: Three squadrons rusht against you, and the first, You tooke so fiercely, that, you beate their thoughts Out of their bosoms, from the vrged fight: The second, all amazed you ouerthrew, The third disperst, with fiue and twenty horse Left of the fourescore that persude the chase: And this braue conquest, now your Marshall seconds Against two squadrons, but with fifty horse, One after other he defeates them both, And made them runne, like men whose heeles were tript, And pitch their heads, in their great generalls lap: And him he sets on, as he had beene shot Out of a Cannan: beates him into route, And as a little brooke being ouerrunne With a black torrent; that beares all things downe, His furie ouertakes, his fomy back, Loded with Cattaile, and with stackes of Corne, And makes the miserable Plowman mourne; So was du Maine surchardgd, and so Byron Flow'd ouer all his forces; euery drop Of his lost bloud, bought with a worthy man; And, onely with a hundred Gentlemen He wonne the place, from fifteene hundred horse; Hen. He won the place? Sau. On my word, so tis sayd: Hen. Fie you haue beene extreamely misinform'd. Sau. I onely tell your highnesse what I heard, I was not there; and though I haue beene rude, With wonder of his vallor, and presum'd, To keepe his merit in his full carire, Not hearing you, when your, made such a thunder; Pardon my fault, since twas t'extoll your seruant; But, is it not most true, that twixt yee both, So few achiu'd, the conquest of so many? Henr. It is a truth, must make me euer thankefull, But not performd by him, was not I there? Commanded him, and in the maine assault, Made him but second? Sau. Hee's the capitall souldier, That liues this day in holy Christendome, Except your highnesse, alwaies except Plato. Hen. We must not giue to one, to take from many, For (not to praise our countrimen) here seru'd, The Generall My Lor. Norris, sent from England: As great a captaine as the world affords: One fit to leade, and fight for Christendome; Of more experience; and of stronger braine; As valiant for abiding; In Command, On any sodaine; vpon any ground And in the forme of all occasions As ready, and as profitably, dauntles; And heare was then another; Collonell Williams, A worthy Captaine; and more like the Duke, Because he was lesse temperate then the Generall; And being familliar with the man you praise, (Because he knew him haughty and incapable, Of all comparison) would compare with him, And hold his swelling valour to the marke, Iustice had set in him, and not his will: And as in open vessells filld with water, And on mens shoulders borne, they put treene cuppes, To keepe the wild and slippery element, From washing ouer: follow all his Swayes And tickle aptnes to exceed his bounds, And at the Brym containe him: so this knight, Swum in Byron, and held him, but to right, But leaue these hot comparisons, hee's mine owne, And then what I possesse, Ile more be knowne, Sau. All this shall to the duke, I fisht for this. Exeunt. FINIS. Actus Secundi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS 3. SCAENA 1. Enter La Fin, Byron following vnseene. Laff. A fained passion in his hearing now, (Which he thinkes I perceaue not) making conscience, Of the reuolt that he hath vrdgd to me, Which now he meanes to prosecute would sound, How deepe he stands affected with that scruple. As when the Moone hath comforted the Night, And set the world in siluer of her light, The Planets, Asterisims and whole state of Heauen, In beames of gold desending; all the windes, Bound vp in caues, chargd not to driue abrode, Their cloudy heads; an vniuersall peace, Proclaimd in scilence of the quiet earth. Soone as her hot and dry fumes are let loose, Stormes and cloudes mixing; sodainely put out. The eyes of all those glories: The creation, Turnd into Chaos, and we then desire, For all our ioye of life, the death of sleepe; So when the glories of our liues, mens loues, Cleere consciences, our fames, and loyalties, That did vs worthy comfort, are eclipsd, Griefe and disgrace inuade vs; and for all, Our night of life besides, our Miserie craues, Darke earth would ope and hide vs in our graues, Byr. How Strange is this? Laff. What? did your highnesse heare? Byr. Both heard and wonderd, that your wit and spirit, And proffit in experience of the slaueries, Impos'd on vs; in those mere politique termes, Of loue, fame, loyalty, can be carried vp, To such a height of ignorant conscience; Of cowardise, and dissolution, In all the free-borne powers of royall man, You that haue made way through all the guards, Of Ielouse State; and seen on both your sides, The pikes points chardging heauen to let you passe, Will you, (in flying with a Scrupulouse wing, Aboue those pikes to heauen-ward) fall on them? This is like men, that (spirrited with wine,) Passe dangerouse places safe; and die for feare, With onely thought of them, being simply sober; We must (in passing to our wished ends, Through things calld good and bad) be like the ayre, That euenly interposd betwixt the seas, And the opposed Element of fire; At either toucheth, but pertakes with neither; Is neither hot, nor cold, but with a sleight. And harmelesse temper mixt of both th'extreames; Laff. Tis shrode. Byr. There is no truth of any good To be descernd on earth: and by conuersion, Nought therefore simply bad: But as the stuffe, Prepard for Arras pictures, is no Picture, Till it be formd, and man hath cast the beames, Of his imaginouse fancie through it, In forming antient Kings and conquerors, As he conceiues they look't, and were attirde, Though they were nothing so: so all things here, Haue all their price set downe, from mens concepts, Which make all terms and actions, good, or bad, And are but pliant, and wel-coloured threads, Put into fained images of truth: To which, to yeeld, and kneele, as truth pure kings, That puld vs downe with cleere truth of their Ghospell, Were Superstition to be hist to hell. Laff. Beleeue it, this is reason; Byr. T'is the saith, Of reason and of wisdome. Laff. You perswade, As if you could create: what man can shunne, The serches, and compressions of your graces. Byr. We must haue these lures when we hawke for friends, And wind about them like a subtle Riuer, That (seeming onely to runne on his course) Doth serch yet, as he runnes; and still finds out, The easiest parts of entry on the shore; Glyding so slyly by, as scarce it toucht, Yet still eates some thing in it: so must those, That haue large fields, and currants to dispose. Come, let vs ioyne our streames, we must runne far. And haue but little time: The duke Sauoy, Is shortly to be gone, and I must needes, Make you well knowne to him, Laff. But hath your highnes, Some enterprise of value ioynd with him? Byr. With him and greater persons? Laffi. I will creepe. Vpon my bosome in your Princely seruice, Vouch-safe to make me knowne. I heare there liues not, So kind, so bountyfull, and wise a Prince, But in your owne excepted excellence. Byr. He shall both know, and loue you: are you mine? Laff. I take the honor of it, on my knee, And hope to quite it with your Maiesty. Exit. Enter Sauoy, Roncas, Rochet Breton. Sau. La Fin, is in the right; and will obtaine; He draweth with his weight; and like a plummet That swaies a dore, with falling of, pulls after, Ron. Thus will Laffin be brought a Stranger to you, By him he leads; he conquers that is conquerd, Thats sought, as hard to winne, that sues to be wonne. Sau. But is my Painter warnd to take his picture. When he shall see me, and present Laffin? Roch. He is (my Lord) and (as your highnesse willd) All we will presse about him and admire, The royall promise of his rare aspect, As if he heard not. Sau. Twill enflame him. Such trickes the Arch-duke vsd t'extoll his greatnes, Which complements though plaine men hold absurd, And a meere remedy for desire of Greatnesse. Yet great men vse them; as they eate Potatoes, High Coollises, and potions to excite The lust of their ambition: and this Duke; You know is noted in his naturall garb Extreamly glorious; who will therefore bring An appetite expecting such a baite; He comes, go instantly, and fetch the Painter, Enter Byron, La Fin. Byr. All honor to your heighnesse, Sau. Tis most true. All honours flow to me, in you their Ocean; As welcome worthyest duke, as if my marquisate, Were circkl'd with you in these amorous armes; Byr. I sorrow Sir I could not bring it with me, That I might so supply the fruitelesse complement, Of onely visiting your excellence, With which the king now sends me t'entertaine you, Which notwithstanding doth confer this good, That it hath giuen me some small time to shew, My gratitude for the many secret bounties, I haue (by this your Lord Ambassador) Felt from your heighnesse and in short, t'assure you, That all my most deserts are at your seruice. Sau. Had the king sent me by you halfe his kingdome, It were not halfe so welcom; Byr. For defect. Of whatsoeuer in my selfe, (my Lord,) I here commend to your most Princely Seruice This honord friend of mine; Sau. Your name I pray you Sir. Laff. Laffin, my Lord. Sau. Laffin? Is this the man, That you so recommended to my Loue? Ron. The same my Lord, Sau. Y'are next my Lord the duke, The most desird of all men. O my Lord, The King and I, haue had a mighty conflict, About your conflicts, and your matchles worth, In military vertues; which I put In Ballance with the continent of France, In all the peace and safty it enioyes. And made euen weight with all he could put in Of all mens else; and of their owne deserts, Byr. Of all mens else? would he weigh other mens, With my deseruings, Sau. I vpon my life, The English Generall, the Mylor' Norris, That seru'd amongst you here, he paralleld With you, at all parts, and in some preferd him, And Collonell Williams (a Welch Collonell) He made a man, that at your most containd you: Which the Welch Herrald of their praise, the Cucko. Would scarce haue put, in his monology, In iest, and said with reuerence to his merits, Byr. With reuerence? Reuerence skornes him: by the spoyle, Of all her Merits in me, he shall rue it; Did euer Curtian Gullffe play such a part? Had Curtius beene so vsed, if he had brook't, That rauenous whirlepoole, pourd his solide spirrits, Through earth dissolued sinews, stopt her veines, And rose with saued Rome, vpon his backe, As I swum pooles of fire, and Gullfs of brasse, To saue my country? thrust this venturous arme, Beneath her ruines; tooke her on my necke, And set her safe on her appeased shore? And opes the king, a fouler bog then this, In his so rotten bosome, to deuoure Him that deuourd, what else had swalloed him In a detraction, so with spight embrewed, And drowne such good in such ingratitude? My spirrit as yet, but stooping to his rest, Shines hotly in him, as the Sunne in clowds, Purpled, and made proud with a peacefull Eden: But when I throughly set to him; his cheekes, Will (like those clouds) forgoe their collour quite, And his whole blaze, smoke into endles night, Sau. Nay nay, we must haue no such gall my Lord, O'reflow our friendly liuers: my relation, Onely deliuers my enflamed zeale To your religious merits; which me thinkes, Should make your highnes canonizd, a Saint. Byr. What had his armes beene, without my arme, That with his motion, made the whole field moue? And this held vp, we still had victory. When ouer charg'd with number, his few friends, Retir'd amazed, I set them on assurd, And what rude ruine seas'd on I confirmed; When I left leading, all his army reeld, One fell on other foule, and as the Cyclop That hauing lost his eye, strooke euery way, His blowes directed to no certaine scope; Or as the soule departed from the body, The body wants coherence in his parts, Can not consist, but seuer, and dissolue; So I remou'd once, all his armies shooke, Panted, and fainted, and were euer flying, Like wandring pulses sperst through bodies dying, Sau. It cannot be denied, tis all so true, That what seemes arogance, is desert in you, Byr. What monstrous humors feed a Princes blood, Being bad to good men, and to bad men good? Sau. Well let these contradictions passe (my lord,) Till they be reconcil'd, or put in forme, By power giuen to your will, and you present, The fashion of a prefect gouernment; In meane space but a word, we haue small time, To spend in priuate, which I wish may be With all aduantage taken; Lord Laffin. Ron. Ist not a face of excellent presentment, Though not so amorouse with pure white, and red, Yet is the whole proportion singular; Roch. That euer I beheld, Bret. It hath good lines, And tracts drawne through it: The purfle, rare, Ron. I heard the famous and right learned Earle, And Archbishop of Lions Peirse Pinac, Who was reported to haue wondrouse Iudgment In mens euents, and natures, by their lookes: (Vpon his death bed, visited by this duke) He told his sister, when his grace was gon, That he had neuer yet obserud a face, Of worse presage then this: and I will sweare, That (something seene in Phisiognomy) I do not find in all the rules he giues One slendrest blemish tending to mishap, But (on the opposite part) as we may see, On trees late blossomd, when all frosts are past, How they are taken, and what wil be fruit: So, on this tree of Scepters, I discerne How it is loden with apparances, Rules answering Rules; and glances, crownd with glances; He snatches away the picture. Byr. What, does he take my picture? Sau. I my Lord. Byr. Your Highnesse will excuse me; I will giue you My likenesse put in Statue, not in picture; And by a Statuary of mine owne, That can in Brasse expresse the witte of man, And in his forme, make all men see his vertues: Others that with much strictnesse imitate, The some-thing stooping carriage of my neck, The voluble, and milde radiance of mine eyes, Neuer obserue my Masculine aspect, And Lyon-like instinct, it shaddoweth: Which Enuie cannot say, is flatterie: And I will haue my Image promist you, Cut in such matter, it shall euer last; Where it shall stand, fixt with eternall rootes, And with a most vnmooued grauitie; For I will haue the famous mountaine Oros, That lookes out of the Dutchy where I gouerne, (Into your highnesse Dukedome) first made yours, And then with such inimitable art Exprest and handled; chieflie from the place Where most conspicuously, he shewes his face, That though it keepe the true forme of that hill In all his longitudes, and latitudes, His height, his distances, and full proportion, Yet shall it cleerely beare my counterfaite, Both in my face and all my lineaments: And euery man shall say, this is Byron. Within my left hand, I will hold a Cittie, Which is the Cittie Amiens; at whose siedge I seru'd so memorably: from my right, Ile powre an endlesse flood, into a Sea Raging beneath me; which shall intimate My ceaselesse seruice, drunke vp by the King As th'Ocean drinkes vp riuers, and makes all Beare his proude title; Iuory, Brasse and Goulde, That theeues may purchase; and be bought and sould, Shall not be vsde about me; lasting worth Shall onely set the duke of Byron forth; Sau. O that your statuary could expresse you, With any nerenesse to your owne instructions; That statue would I prise past all the iewells Within my cabinet of Beatrice, The memorie of my Grandame Portugall; Most roiall duke: we can not longe endure To be thus priuate, let vs then conclude, With this great resolution: that your wisedome, Will not forget to cast a pleasing vaile Ouer your anger; that may hide each glance, Of any notice taken of your wronge, And shew your self the more obsequious, Tis but the virtue of a little patience, There are so oft attempts made gainst his person, That sometimes they may speede, for they are palnts That spring the more for cutting, and at last Will cast their wished shadow; marke ere long, Enter Nemours Soisson. See who comes here my Lord, as now no more, Now must we turne our streame another way; My Lord, I humbly thanke his maiesty, That he would grace my idle time spent here With entertainement of your princely person; VVhich, worthely, he keepes for his owne bosome. My Lord, the duke Nemours? and Count Soisson? Your honours haue beene bountifully done me In often visitation: let me pray you, To see some iewells now, and helpe my choice: In making vp a present for the King. Nem. Your highnesse shall much grace vs. Sau. I am doubtfull That I haue much incenst the duke Byron, With praising the Kings worthinesse in armes So much past all men. Sois. He deserues it, highly. Exit. mÃ¦net Byr: Laffin. Byr. What wrongs are these, laid on me by the King, To equall others worths in warre, with mine; Endure this, and be turnd into his Moile To beare his sumptures: honord friend be true, And we will turne these torrents, hence. The King. Exit Laffi. Enter Henry, Espe: Vitry, Ianin. Hen. Why suffer you that ill aboding vermine, To breede so neere your bosome? bee assurde, His hants are omenous, not the throtes of Rauens, Spent on infected house; houles of dogges, When no sound stirres, at mid-night; apparitions, And strokes of spirits, clad in black mens shapes: Or ougly womens: the aduerse decrees Of constellations, not securitie, In vicious peace, are surer fatall vshers Of femall mischiefes, and mortallities, Then this prodigious feend is, where he fawnes: La fiend, and not Laffin, he should be cald. Byr. Be what he will, men in themselues entire, March safe with naked feete on coles of fire: I build not outward, nor depend on proppes, Nor chuse my consort by the common eare: Nor by the Moone-shine in the grace of Kings: So rare are true deseruers, lou'd or knowne, That men lou'd vulgarely, are euer none: Nor men grac't seruilely, for being spots In Princes traines, though borne euen with their crownes; The Stalion powre hath such a beesome taile, That it sweepes all from iustice, and such filth He beares out in it, that men mere exempt, Are merely cleerest: men will shortly buie Friends from the prison or the pillorie, Rather then honors markets. I feare none, But foule Ingratitude, and Detraction, In all the brood of villanie. Hen. No? not treason? Be circumspect, for to a credulous eye, He comes inuisible, vail'd with flatterie, And flaterers looke like friends, as Woolues, like Dogges. And as a glorious Poeme fronted well With many a goodly Herrald of his praise, So farre from hate of praises to his face, That he praies men to praise him, and they ride Before, with trumpets in their mouthes, proclayming Life to the holie furie of his lines: All drawne, as if with one eye he had leerd, On his lou'd hand, and led it by a rule; That his plumes onely Imp the Muses wings, He sleepes with them, his head is napt with baies, His lips breake out with Nectar, his tunde feete Are of the great last, the perpetuall motion, And he puft with their empty breath beleeues Full merit, eas'd those passions of winde, Which yet serue, but to praise, and cannot merit, And so his furie in their ayre expires: So de Laffin, and such corrupted Herralds, Hirde to encorage, and to glorifie May force what breath they will into their cheekes Fitter to blow vp bladders, then full men: Yet may puff men to, with perswasions That they are Gods in worth; and may rise Kings With treading on their noises; yer the worthiest, From onely his owne worth receiues his spirit And right is worthy bound to any merit; Which right, shall you haue euer; leaue him then, He followes none but markt, and wretched men; And now for England you shall goe my lord, Our Lord Ambassador to that matchlesse Queene; You neuer had a voiage of such pleasure Honor, and worthy obiects: Ther's a Queene Where nature keepes her state, and state her Court, Wisdome her studie, Conntinence her fort, Where Magnanimity, Humanitie: Firmnesse in counsaile and integritie: Grace to her porest subiects: Maiestie To awe the greatest, haue respects diuine, And in her each part, all the vertues shine. Exit Hen. &amp; Sau. manet Byron. Byr. Inioy your will a while, I may haue mine. VVherefore (before I part to this ambassage) Ile be resolu'd by a Magician That dwells hereby, to whome ile goe disguisde, And shew him my births figure, set before: By one of his profession, of the which Ile craue his iudgement, fayning I am sent From some great personage, whose natiuitie, He wisheth should be censurd by his skill. But on go my plots, be it good or ill. Exit. Enter La Brosse. This houre by all rules of Astrologie, Is dangerous to my person, if not deadly. How haples is our knowledge to fore-tel And not be able to preuent a mischiefe, O the strange difference twixt vs and the stars: They worke with inclynations stronge and fatall And nothing know; and we know all there working And nought can do, or nothing can preuent? Rude ignorance is beastly, knowledge wretched: The heauenly powers enuy what they Enioyne: VVe are commanded t'imitate there natures, In making all our ends eternitie: And in that imitation we are plagued, And worsse then they esteemd, that haue no soules, But in their nostrils, and like beasts expire; As they do that are ignorant of arts, By drowning there eternall parts in sence, And sensuall affectations: while wee liue Our good parts take away, the more they giue. Byron solus disguizd like a Carrier of letters. Byr. The forts that fauorites hold in Princes hearts, In common subiects loues; and their owne strengths Are not so sure, and vnexpugnable, But that the more they are presum'd vpon, The more they faile; dayly and hourely proofe, Tels vs prosperity is at highest degree The founte and handle of calamitie: Like dust before a whirle-winde those men flie, That prostrate on the grounds of fortune lye: And being great (like trees that broadest sproyte) Their owne top-heauy state grubs vp their roote. These apprehensions startle all my powers, And arme them with suspition gainst them-selues, In my late proiects; I haue cast my selfe Into the armes of others; and will see If they will let me fall; or tosse me vp Into th'affected compasse of a throne. God saue you sir. Labross. Y'are welcome friend; what would you? Byr. I would entreate you, for some crownes I bring, To giue your iudgement of this figure cast. To know by his natiuitie there seene; What sort of end the person shall endure, Who sent me to you, and whose birth it is. Labross. Ile herein do my best, in your desire; The man is raisd out of a good descent, And nothing oulder then your selfe I thinke; Is it not you? Byr. I will not tell you that: But tell me on what end he shall arriue. Labross. My sonne, I see, that he whose end is cast In this set figure, is of Noble parts, And by his militarie valure raisde, To princely honors; and may be a king, But that I see a Caput Algol here, That hinders it I feare. Byr. A Caput Algol? What's that I pray? Labross. Forbeare to aske me, sonne, You bid me speake, what feare bids me conceale. Byr. You haue no cause to feare, and therefore speake. Labross. Youle rather wish you had beene ignorant, Then be instructed in a thing so ill. Byr. Ignorance is an idle salue for ill, And therefore do not vrge me to enforce, What I would freely know: for by the skill Showne in thy aged hayres, ile lay thy braine Here scattered at my feete, and seeke in that, What safely thou must vtter with thy tongue, If thou deny it. Labross. Will you not allow me To hold my peace? what lesse can I desire? If not, be pleasd with my constrained speech. Byr. Was euer man yet punisht for expressing What he was chargde? be free, and speake the wurst. Labross. Then briefly this; the man hath lately done An action that will make him loose his head. Byr. Curst be thy throte &amp; soule, Rauen, Shriech-owle, hag. Labross. O hold, for heauens sake hold. Byr. Hold on, I will, Vault, and contractor of all horrid sounds, Trumpet of all the miseries in hell, Of my confusions; of the shamefull end Of all my seruices; witch, fiend, accurst For euer be the poison of thy tongue, And let the black fume of thy venomd breath, Infect the ayre, shrinke heauen, put out the starres, And raine so fell and blew a plague on earth, That all the world may falter with my fall. Labross. Pitty my age, my Lord. Byr. Out prodigie, Remedy of pitty, mine of flint, Whence with my nailes and feete, ile digge enough, Horror, and sauadge cruelty, to build Temples to Massacre: dam of deuils take thee, Hadst thou no better end to crowne my parts. The Buls of Colchos, nor his triple neck, That howles out Earthquakes: the most mortall vapors, That euer stifled and strooke dead the fowles, That flew at neuer such a sightly pitch, Could not haue burnt my bloud so. Labross. I told truth, And could haue flatterd you. Byr. O that thou hadst; Would I had giuen thee twenty thousand crownes That thou hadst flatterd me: there's no ioy on earth, Neuer so rationall, so pure, and holy, But is a Iester, Parasite, a Whore, In the most worthy parts, with which they please, A drunkennesse of soule, and a disease. Labross. I knew you not. Byr. Peace, dog of Pluto, peace, Thou knewst my end to come, not me here present: Pox of your halting humane knowledges; O death! how farre off hast thou kild? how soone A man may know too much, though neuer nothing? Spight of the Starres, and all Astrologie, I will not loose my head: or if I do, A hundred thousand heads shall off before. I am a nobler substance then the Starres, And shall the bafer ouer-rule the better? Or are they better, since they are the bigger? I haue a will, and faculties of choise, To do, or not to do: and reason why, I doe, or not doe this: the starres haue none, They know not why they shine, more then this Taper, Nor how they worke, nor what: ile change my course, Ile peece-meale pull, the frame of all my thoughts, And cast my will into another mould: And where are all your Caput Algols then? Your Plannets all, being vnderneath the earth, At my natiuitie: what can they doe? Malignant in aspects? in bloudy houses? Wilde fire consume them; one poore cup of wine, More then I vse, that my weake braine will beare, Shall make them drunke and reele out of their spheres, For any certaine act they can enforce. O that mine armes were wings, that I might flie, And pluck out of their hearts, my destinie! Ile weare those golden Spurres vpon my heeles, And kick at fate; be free all worthy spirits, And stretch your selues, for greatnesse and for height: Vntrusse your slaueries, you haue height enough, Beneath this steepe heauen to vse all your reaches, 'Tis too farre off, to let you, or respect you. Giue me a spirit that on this lifes rough sea, Loues t'haue his sailes fild with a lustie winde, Euen till his Sayle-yeards tremble; his Masts crack, And his rapt ship runne on her side so lowe That she drinkes water, and her keele plowes ayre; There is no danger to a man, that knowes What life and death is: there's not any law, Exceeds his knowledge; neither is it lawfull That he should stoope to any other lawe. He goes before them, and commands them all, That to him-selfe is a law rationall, Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS 4. SCE. 1. Enter D' Aumont, with Crequi. The Duke of Byron is return'd from England, And (as they say) was Princely entertainde, Schoold by the matchlesse Queene there, who I heare Spake most diuinely; and would gladly heare, Her speech reported. Cre. I can serue your turne, As one that speakes from others not from her, And thus it is reported at his parting, Thus Monsieur Du Byron you haue beheld, Our Court proportion'd to our little kingdome, In euery entertainment; yet our minde, To do you all the rites of your repaire, Is as vnbounded as the ample ayre. What idle paines haue you bestowd to see A poore ould woman? who in nothing liues More, then in true affections, borne your king; And in the perfect knowledge she hath learn'd, Of his good knights, and seruants of your sort. We thanke him that he keepes the memory Of vs and all our kindnesse; but must say, That it is onely kept; and not laid out To such affectionate profit as we wish; Being so much set on fire with his deserts, That they consume vs; not to be restorde By your presentment of him; but his person: And we had thought, that he whose vertues flye So beyond wonder, and the reach of thought, Should check at eight houres saile, and his high spirit That stoopes to feare, lesse then the Poles of heauen; Should doubt an vnder billow of the Sea, And (being a Sea) be sparing of his streames: And I must blame all you that may aduise him; That (hauing helpt him through all martiall dangers) You let him stick, at the kinde rites of peace, Considering all the forces I haue sent, To set his martiall seas vp in firme walls, On both his sides for him to passe at pleasure; Did plainly open him a guarded way And led in Nature to this friendly shore, But here is nothing worth his personall sight, Here are no walled Citties; for that Christall Sheds with his light, his hardnesse, and his height About our thankfull person, and our Realme; Whose onely ayde, we euer yet desirde; And now I see, the helpe we sent to him, Which should haue swum to him in our owne bloud, Had it beene needfull; (our affections Being more giuen to his good, then he himselfe) Ends in the actuall right it did his state, And ours is sleighted; all our worth is made, The common-stock, and banck; from whence are seru'd All mens occasions; yet (thankes to heauen) Their gratitudes are drawne drye; not our bounties. And you shall tell your King, that he neglects Ould friends for new; and sets his soothed Ease Aboue his honor; Marshals policie In ranck before his iustice; and his profit Before his royalty: his humanitie gone, To make me no repaiment of mine owne. D' Au. What answered the Duke? Cre. In this sort. Your highnesse sweete speech hath no sharper end, Then he would wish his life; if he neglected, The least grace you haue nam'd; but to his wish, Much powre is wanting: the greene rootes of warre, Not yet so close cut vp, but he may dash Against their relickes to his vtter ruine, Without more neere eyes, fixt vpon his feete, Then those that looke out of his countries soyle, And this may well excuse his personall presence, Which yet he oft hath long'd to set by yours: That he might immitate the Maiestie, Which so long peace hath practisde, and made full, In your admir'd apparance; to illustrate And rectifie his habite in rude warre. And his will to be here, must needs be great, Since heauen hath thron'de so true a royaltie here, That he thinkes no king absolutely crownde, Whose temples haue not stood beneath this skie, And whose height is not hardned with these starres, Whose influences for this altitude, Distild, and wrought in with this temperate ayre, And this diuision of the Element Haue with your raigne, brough: forth more worthy spirits, For counsaile, valour, height of wit, and art, Then any other region of the earth: Or were brought forth to all your ancestors, And as a cunning Orator, reserues His fairest similies, best-adorning figures, Chiefe matter, and most mouing arguments For his conclusion; and doth then supply His ground-streames layd before, glides ouer them, Makes his full depth seene through; and so takes vp, His audience in Aplawses past the clowds. So in your gouernment, conclusiue nature, (Willing to end her Excellence in earth When your foote shall be set vpon the starres) Showes all her Soueraigne Beauties, Ornaments, Vertues, and Raptures; ouertakes her workes In former Empires, makes them but your foyles, Swels to her full Sea, and againe doth drowne The world, in admiration of your crowne. D' Au. He did her (at all parts) confessed right. Cre. She tooke it yet, but as a part of Court-ship, And sayd, he was the subtle Orator, To whom he did too gloriously resemble, Nature in her, and in her gouernment, He said, he was no Orator, but a Souldier, More then this ayre, in which you breath hath made me, My studious loue, of your rare gouernment, And simple truth, which is most eloquent, Your Empire is so amply absolute, That euen your Theaters show more comely rule, True noblesse, royaltie, and happinesse Then others courts: you make all state before Vtterly obsolete; all to come, twice sod. And therefore doth my royall Soueraigne wish Your yeares may proue, as vitall, as your virtues, That (standing on his Turrets this way turn'd, Ordring and fixing his affaires by yours) He may at last, on firme grounds, passe your Seas, And see that Maiden-sea of Maiestie, In whose chaste armes, so many kingdomes lye. D' Au. When came she to her touch of his ambition? Cre. In this speech following, which I thus remember. If I hold any merit worth his presence, Or any part of that, your Courtship giues me, My subiects haue bestowd it; some in counsaile, In action some, and in obedience all; For none knowes, with such proofe as you my Lord, How much a subiect may renowne his Prince. And how much Princes of their subiects hold; In all the seruices that euer subiect Did for his Soueraigne; he that best deseru'd Must (in comparison) except, Byron; And to winne this prise cleere; without the maimes Commonly giuen men by ambition, When all their parts lye open to his view, Showes continence, past their other excellence, But for a subiect to affect a kingdome, Is like the Cammell, that of Ioue begd hornes, And such mad-hungrie men, as well may eate, Hote coles of fire, to feede their naturall heate; For, to aspire to competence with your king What subiect is so grose, and Gyantly? He hauing now a Daulphine borne to him, Whose birth, ten dayes before, was dreadfully Vsherd with Earth-quakes, in most parts of Europe, And that giues all men, cause enough to feare All thought of competition with him. Commend vs good my Lord, and tell our Brother How much we ioy, in that his royall issue, And in what prayers, we raise our heart to heauen, That in more terror to his foes, and wonder He may drinke Earthquakes, and deuoure the thunder, So we admire your valure and your vertues, And euer will contend, to winne their honor. Then spake she to Crequie, and Prince D' Auergne, And gaue all gracious farewels; when Byron Was thus encountred by a Councellor Of great and eminent name, and matchlesse merit: I thinke (my Lord) your princely Daulphin beares Arion in his Cradle, through your kingdome, In the sweete Musique ioy strikes from his birth. He answerd; and good right; the cause commands it. But (said the other) had we a fift Henry, To claime his ould right: and one man to friend, Whom you well know my Lord, that for his friendship Were promist the Vice-royaltie of France, We would not doubt of conquest, in despight Of all those windy Earth-quakes. He replyed; Treason was neuer guide to English conquests, And therefore that doubt shall not fright our Daulphine; Nor would I be the friend to such a foe, For all the royalties in Christendome. Fix there your foote (sayd he) I onely giue False sire, and would be lothe to shoote you of: He that winnes Empire with the losse of faith, Out-buies it; and will banck-route; you haue layde A braue foundation, by the hand of victorie: Put not the roofe to fortune, foolish statuaries, That vnder little Saints suppose, great bases Make lesse, to sence, the Saints; and so where fortune, Aduanceth vile mindes, to states great and noble, She much more exposeth them to shame, Not able to make good, and fill their bases, With a conformed structure; I haue found, (Thankes to the blesser of my searche) that counsailes, Held to the lyne of Iustice; still produce, The surest states, and greatest, being sure, Without which fit assurance, in the greatest, As you may see a mighty promontorie More digd and vnder-eaten, then may warrant, A safe supportance, to his hanging browes, All passengers auoide him, shunne all ground That lyes within his shadow, and beare still A flying eye vpon him, so great men Corrupted in their ground, and building out. Too swelling fronts, for their foundations; When most they should be propt, are most forsaken, And men will rather thrust into the stormes Of better grounded States, then take a shelter Beneath their ruinous, and fearefull weight; Yet they, so ouersee, their faultie bases, That they remaine securer in conceipt: And that securitie, doth worse presage Their nere distructions, then their eaten grounds; And therefore heauen it selfe is made to vs A perfect Hierogliphick to expresse, The Idlenesse of such securitie, And the graue labour, of a wise distrust, In both sorts of the all-enclying starres; Where all men note this difference in their shyning, As plaine as they distinguish either hand; The fixt starres mauer, and the erring, stand. D' Aum. How tooke he this so worthy admonition? Cre. Grauely applied (said he) and like the man, Whome all the world saies, ouerrules the starres; Which are diuine bookes to vs; and are read By vnderstanders onely, the true obiects, And chiefe companions of the truest men; And (though I need it not) I thanke your counsaile, That neuer yet was idle, But spherelike, Still mooues about, and is the continent To this blest Ile.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. 5. SCEN. 1. Enter Byron, D' Auergne, Laffin. Byr. The Circkle of this ambassie is closde, For which I long haue long'd, for mine owne ends; To see my faithfull, and leaue courtly friends, To whom I came (me thought) with such a spirit, As you haue seene, a lusty courser showe, That hath beene longe time at his manger tied; High fead, alone, and when (his headstall broken) Hee runnes his prison, like a trumpet neighs, Cuts ayre, in high curuets, and shakes his head: (With wanton stopings, twixt his forelegs) mocking The heauy center; spreds his flying crest, Like to an Ensigne, hedge, and ditches leaping, Till in the fresh meate, at his naturall foode He sees free fellowes, and hath met them free: And now (good friend) I would be faine inform'd, What our right Princely Lord, the duke of Sauoy Hath thought on, to employ my comming home. Laf. To try the Kings trust in you, and withall, How hot he trailes on our conspiracie: He first would haue you, begge the gouernment, Of the important Citadell of Bourg: Or to place in it, any you shall name: VVhich wilbe wondrous fit, to march before, His other purposes; and is a fort Hee rates, in loue, aboue his patrimonie; To make which fortresse worthie of your suite: He vowes (if you obtaine it) to bestowe His third faire daughter, on your excellence, And hopes the King will not deny it you. Byr. Denie it me? deny me such a suite? VVho will he grant, if he deny it me. Laf. He'le finde some politique shift to do't, I feare. Bir. VVhat shift? or what euasion can he finde, VVhat one patch is there in all policies shop, (That botcher vp of Kingdomes) that can mend The brack betwixt vs, any way denying. D' Au. Thats at your perill: Byr. Come, he dares not do't. D' Au. Dares not? presume not so; you know (good duke) That all things hee thinkes fit to do, he dares. Byr. By heauen I wonder at you, I will aske it, As sternely, and secure of all repulse As th'antient Persians did when they implorde, Their idoll fire to grant them any boone; With which they would descend into a flood, And threaten there to quench it, if they faild, Of that they ask't it: Laffi. Said like your Kings King; Cold hath no act in depth, nor are suites wrought (Of any high price) that are coldly sought: Ile hast, and with your courage, comfort Sauoy. Exit Laffin. D' Au. I am your friend (my Lord) and will deserue That name, with following any course you take; Yet (for your owne sake) I could wish your spirit Would let you spare all broade termes of the King, Or, on my life you will at last repent it: Byr. What can he doe? D' Au. All that you can not feare. Byr. You feare too much, be by, when next I see him, And see how I will vrge him in this suite, He comes, marke you, that thinke He will not grant it. Enter Henry, Esp. Soiss. Ia. I am become a suiter to your highnesse. Hen. For what, my Lord, tis like you shall obtaine. Byr. I do not much doubt that; my seruices, I hope haue more strength in your good conceite Then to receiue repulse, in such requests. Hen. What is it? Byr. That you would bestowe on one whom I shall name, The keeping of the Citadell of Bourg, Hen. Excuse me sir, I must not grant you that. Byr. Not grant me this sute? Hen. It is not fit I should; You are my gouernor in Burgundy, And Prouince gouernors, that command in chiefe, Ought not to haue the charge of fortresses; Besides, it is the chiefe key of my kingdome, That opens towards Italie, and must therefore, Be giuen to one that hath imediatly Dependance on vs. Byr: These are wondrous reasons, Is not a man depending on his merits As fit to haue the charge of such a key As one that meerely hangs vppon your humors? Hen: Do not enforce your merits so your self; It takes away their luster, and reward. Byr: But you will grant my suite? Hen: I sweare I cannot Keeping the credit of my braine and place. Byr: Will you deny me then? Hen: I am inforcst; I haue no power, more then your selfe in things That are beyond my reason. Byr: Then my selfe? That's a strange sleight in your comparison; Am I become th'example of such men As haue lest power? Such a diminitiue? I was comparatiue in the better sort; And such a King as you, would say I cannot, Do such; or such a thing; were I as great In power as he; euen that indefinite he, Exprest me full: This Moone is strangely chang'd; Hen: How can I helpe it? would you haue a King That hath a white beard; haue so greene a braine? Byr: A plague of braine; what doth this touch your braine? You must giue me more reason or I sweare Hen: Sweare; what do you sweare? Byr: I Sweare you wrong me, And deale not like a King, to iest, and sleight, A man that you should curiously reward; Tell me of your gray beard? it is not gray With care to recompence me, who eas'd your care. Hen: You haue beene recompenc't, from head to foote. Byr: With a distrusted dukedome: Take your dukedome Bestow'd on me againe; It was not giuen For any loue, but feare, and force of shame; Hen: Yet twas your honor; which if you respect not, Why seeke you this Adition? Byron. Since this honour, Would shew you lou'd me to, in trusting me, Without which loue, and trust; honor is shame; A very Pageant, and a propertie: Honor, with all his Adiuncts, I deserue, And you quit my deserts, with your gray beard. Hen: Since you expostulate the matter so; I tell you plaine; Another reason is Why I am mou'd to make you this deniall That I suspect you to haue had intelligence With my vowd enimies. Byr: Miserie of vertue, Ill is made good, with worse? This reason poures Poyson, for Balme, into the wound you made; You make me madde, and rob me of my soule, To take away my try'd loue, and my Truth; Which of my labors, which of all my woundes, Which ouerthrow, which Battayle wonne for you, Breedes this suspition? Can the blood of faith, (Lost in all these to finde it proofe, and strength) Beget disloya'ty? all my raine is falne, Into the horse-fayre; springing pooles and myre; And not in thankfull grounds, or fields of fruite; Fall then before vs, O thou flaming Christall, That art the vncorrupted Register Of all mens merits: And remonstrate heere, The fights, the dangers, the affrights and horrors, Whence I haue rescu'd this vnthankefull King: And shew (commixt with them) the ioyes, the glories Of his state then: Then his kind thoughts of me: Then my deseruings: Now my infamie: But I will be mine owne King: I will see, That all your Chronicles be fild with me, That none but I, and my renowned Syre Be said to winne the memorable fieldes Of Arques and Deepe: and none but we of all Kept you from dying there, in an Hospitall; None but my selfe, that wonne the day at Dreux: A day of holy name, and needes, no night: Nor none but I at Fountaine Francois burst, The heart strings of the leaguers; I alone, Tooke Amiens in these armes and held her fast, In spight of all the Pitchy fires she cast, And clowds of bullets pourd vpon my brest, Till she shewd yours; and tooke her naturall forme, Onely my selfe (married to victory) Did people Artois, Douay, Picardie, Bethune, and Saint Paul, Bapaume, and Courcelles, With her triumphant issue; Hen. Ha ha ha, Exit, Byron drawing and is held by D'Au. D' Au. O hold my Lord; for my sake, mighty Spirrit. Exit. Enter Byron Dau following vnseene. Byr. Respect Reuendge, slaughter, repaie for laughter, Whats' graue in Earth, what awfull? what abhord. If my rage be ridiculouse? I will make it, The law and rule of all things serious, So long as such as he Are suffered, soothed and wrest all right, to safty So long is mischiefe gathering massacres, For their curst kingdomes; which I will preuent, Laughter? I'le fright it from him, farre as he, Hath cast irreuocable shame; which euer, Being found is lost and lost returneth neuer; Should Kings cast of their bounties, with their dangers? He that can warme at fires, where vertue burnes. Hunt pleasure through her torments; nothing feele, Of all his subiects suffer; but (long hid) In wants, and miseries, and hauing past Through all the grauest shapes, of worth and honor, (For all Heroique fashions to be learned, By those hard lessons) shew and antique vizard, Who would not wish him rather hewd to nothing, Then left so monstrous? slight my seruices? Drowne the dead noises of my sword, in laughter? My blowes, as but the passages of shadowes, Ouer the highest and most barraine hills, And vse me, like, no man; but as he tooke me Into a desart, gasht with all my wounds, Sustaind for him, and buried me in flies; Forth vengeance then, and open wounds in him Shall let in Spaine, and Sauoy. Offers to draw and D' Au: againe holds him. D' Au: O my Lord, This is to large a licence giuen your furie; Giue time to it, what reason, sodainely, Can not extend, respite doth oft supplie. Byr. While respite, holds reuenge, the wrong redoubles, And so the shame of sufferance, it torments me, To thinke what I endure, at his shrunke hands, That skorne, the guift, of one pore fort to me: That haue subdu'd for him; O iniurie, Forts, Citties, Countries, I, and yet my furie. Exieunt. Hen. Byron? D' Au. My Lord? the King calls, Hen. Turne I pray, How now? from whence flow these distracted faces? From what attempt returne they? as disclayming, Their late Heroique bearer? what, a pistall? Why, good my Lord, can mirth make you so wrathfull? Byr. Mirth? twas mockerie, a contempt; a scandall To my renowne for euer: a repulse, As miserably cold, as Stygian water, That from sincere earth issues, and doth breake The strongest vessells, not to be containde, But in the tough hoofe of a pacient Asse. Hen. My Lord, your iudgement is not competent, In this dissention, I may say of you; As Fame saies of the antient Eleans, That, in th'Olimpian contentions, They euer were the iustest Arbitrators, If none of them contended, nor were parties; Those that will moderate disputations well, Must not themselues affect the coronet; For as the ayre, containd within our eares: If it be not in quiet; nor refrains, Troubling our hearing, with offensiue sounds; But our affected instrument of hearing, Replcat with noise, and singings in it selfe, It faithfully receiues no other voices; So, of all iudgements, if within themselues They suffer spleene, and are tumultuous; They can not equall differences without them; And this winde, that doth sing so in your eares, I know, is no disease bred in your selfe; But whisperd in by others; who in swelling Your vaines with emptie hope of much, yet able, To performe nothing; are like shallow streames, That make themselues so many heauens; to sight; Since you may see in them, the Moone, and Starres, The blew space of the ayre; as farre from vs, (To our weake sences) in those shallow streames As if they were as deepe, as heauen is high; Yet with your middle finger onely, sound them, And you shall pierce them to the very earth; And therefore leaue them, and be true to me Or yow'le be left by all; or be like one That in cold nights will needes haue all the fire, And there is held by others, and embrac't Onely to burne him: your fire wilbe inward, Which not another deluge can put out: Byron kneeles while the King goes on. O Inocence the sacred amulet, Gainst all the poisons of infirmitie: Of all misfortune, iniurie, and death, That makes a man, in tune still in himselfe; Free from the hell to be his owne accuser, Euer in quiet, endle, ioy enioying; No strife, nor no sedition is his powres: No motion in his will, against his reason, No thought gainst thought, Nor (as twere in the confines Of wishing, and repenting) doth possesse Onely a wayward, and tumultuose peace, But (all parts in him, friendly and secure, Fruitefull of all best thinges in all worst Seasons) He can with every wish, be in their plenty, When, the infectious guilt of one foule crime, Destroyes the free content of all our time. Byr: Tis all acknowlegd, and, (though all to late) Heere the short madnesse of my anger ends: If euer I did good I lockt it safe In you, th'impregnable defence of goodnesse: If ill, I presse it with my penitent knees To that vnsounded depth, whence naught returneth. Hen: Tis musique to mine eares: rise then for euer, Quit of what guilt soeuer till this houre, And nothing toucht in honnor or in spirit, Rise without flattery, rise by absolute merit. Enter: Esp: to the King, Byron: &amp;c. Enter Sauoy with three Ladies. Esp. Sir if it please you to bee taught any Courtship take you to your stand: Sauoy is at it with three Mistresses at once he loues each of them best, yet All differently. Hen: For the time he hath beene here, he hath talkt a Volume greater then the Turkes Alcaron; stand vp close; his lips go still. Sau: Excuse me, excuse me; The King has ye all; 1. True Sir, in honorable subiection. 2. To the which we are bound by our loyallty. Sau: Nay your excuse, your excuse, intend me for affection? you are all bearers of his fauours; and deny him not your opposition by night. 3 You say rightly in that; for therein we oppose vs to his command. 1. In the which he neuer yet prest vs. 2. Such is the benediction of our peace. Sau: You take me still in flat misconstruction, and conceiue not by me. 1 Therein we are strong in our owne purposes; for it were something scandalous for vs to conceiue by you. 2. Though there might be question made of your fruitfulnes, yet drie weather in haruest dooes no harme. Hen. They will talke him into Sauoy; he beginnes to hunt downe. Sau. As the King is, and hath beene, a most admired, and the most vnmatchable souldier, so hath he beene, and is, a sole excellent, and vnparalelld Courtier. Hen. Pouvre Amy Mercie. 1. Your highness does the king but right sir. 2. And heauen shall blesse you for that iustice, With plentiful store of want in Ladies affections. Sau. You are cruell, and wil not vouchsafe me audience to any conclusion. 1. Beseech your grace conclude, that we may present our curtsies to you, and giue you the adiew. Sau. It is saide, the king will bring an army into Sauoy. 2. Truely we are not of his counsaile of warre. Sau. Nay but vouchsafe me. 3. Vouchsafe him, vouchsafe him, else there's no play in't. 1. Well I vouchsafe your Grace. Sau. Let the king bring an army into Sauoy, and Ile finde him sport for fortie yeares. Hen. Would I were sure of that, I should then haue a long gae, and a merry. 1. I thinke your Grace woulde play with his army at Balloone. 2. My faith, and that's a martiall recreation. 3. It is next to impious courting. Sau. I am not hee that can set my Squadrons ouer-night, by midnight leape my horse, curry seauen miles, and by three, leape my mistris; returne to mine armie againe, and direct as I were infatigable, I am no such tough souldier. 1. Your disparitie is beleeu'd sir. 2. And tis a peece of virtue to tell true. 3. Gods me, the king, Sau. Well, I haue said nothing that may offend. 1. Tis hop't so, 2. If there be any mercie in laughter. Sau. Ile take my leaue. After the tedious stay my loue hath made, (Most worthy to command our earthly zeale) I come for pardon, and to take my leaue; Affirming though I reape no other good, By this my voiage; but t'haue seene a Prince Of greatnes, in all grace so past report; I nothing should repent me, and to shew, Some token of my gratitude, I haue sent, Into your treasury, the greatest Iewells, In all my Cabinet of Beatrice. And of my late-deceased wife, th'Infanta, Which are two Basigus, and their Ewrs of christall, Neuer yet vallewd for their workmanship, Nor the exceding riches of their matter And to your stable, (worthy duke of Byron, I haue sent in two of my fayrest horses. Byr. Sent me your horses? vpon what desert? I entertaine no presents but for merits; Which I am farre from at your highnes hands; As being of all men to you the most stranger, There is as ample bounty in refusing; As in bestowing, and with this I quit you. Sau. Then haue I lost nought but my poore good will, Hen. Well cosine, I with all thankes, welcome that; And the rich arguments with which you proue it, Wishing I could, to your wish welcome you; Draw, for your marquisate, the articles; Agreed on in our composition, And it is yours, but where you haue porpos'd, (In your aduices) my designe for Millane, I will haue no warre with the king of Spaine, Vnlesse his hopes proue weary of our peace; And (Princely cosine) it is farre from me, To thinke your wisedome, needeful of my counsaile, Yet loue, oft-times must offer things vnneedeful, And therefore I would counsaile you to hold All good termes, with his Maiestie of Spaine: If any troubles should be stirr'd betwixt you, I would not stirre therein, but to appease them; I haue too much care of my royal word, To breake a Peace so iust and consequent, Without force of precedent iniurie: Endles desires are worthles of iust Princes, And onely proper to the swinge of tyrants. Sau. At al partes spoke like the most christian king, I take my humblest leaue, and pray your Highnes, To holde me as your seruant, and poore kinsman, Who wisheth no supreamer happines Than to be yours: To you (right worthy Princes) I wish for all your fauours powr'd on me The loue of al these Ladies mutually, And (so they please their Lordes) that they may please Themselues by all meanes. And be you assurde (Most louely Princesses) as of your liues, You cannot be true women, if true wiues. Exit. Hen. Is this he Espernon, that you would needes Perswades vs courted so absurdly. Esp. This is euen he sir, howsoeuer he hath studied his Parting Courtship. Hen. In what one point seemde hee so ridiculous as you would present him? Esp. Behold me sir, I beseech you behold me, I appeare to you as the great Duke of Sauoy with these three Ladies. Hen. Well sir, we graunt your resemblance. Esp. He stole a carriage sir, from Count d' Auuergne heere. D' Auer. From me sir? Esp. Excuse me sir, from you I assure you: heere sir, he lies at the Lady Antoniette, iust thus, for the worlde, in the true posture of Count d' Auuergne. D' Auer. Y'are exceeding delightsome. Hen. Why is not that wel? it came in with the organ hose. Esp. Organ hose? a pox ant; let it pipe it selfe into contempt; hee hath stolne it most felloniously, and it graces him like a disease. Hen. I thinke he stole it from D' Avuergne indeed. Esp. Well, would he had robd him of all his other diseases, He were then the soundest lord in France. D' Au. As I am sir, I shall stand all wethers with you. Esp. But sir, he has praisd you aboue th'inuention of Rimers. Hen. Wherein? or how? Esp. He tooke vpon him to describe your victories in warre, and where hee should haue sayd, you were the most absolute souldier in Christendome, (no Asse could haue mist it) hee deliuerd you for as pretty a fellow of your hands, as any was in France. Hen. Marry God dild him. Esp. A pox on him. Hen. Well, (to be serious) you know him well To be a gallant Courtier: his great wit Can turne him into any forme he lists, More fit to be auoyded, then deluded. For my Lord Duke of Byron here, well knowes, That it infecteth, where it doth affect: And where it seemes to counsaile, it conspires. With him go all our faults, and from vs flie, (With all his counsaile) all conspiracie. Finis Actus Quinti, &amp; vltimi.</field>
