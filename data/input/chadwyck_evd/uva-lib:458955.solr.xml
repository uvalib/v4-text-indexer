      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus Scæna prima. Enter Neaneres, Sosicles, Eraton. Era. The Generall is returned then? Nean. With much honour. Sol. And peace concluded with the Prince of Argos? Nean. To the Queens wishes: the conditions sign'd So farre beyond her hopes, to the advantage Of Corinth, and the good of all her Subjects; That though Leonidas our brave Generall Ever came home a faire and great example, He never yet return'd, or with lesse losse Or more deserved honour. Era. Have you not heard The motives to this generall good? Nean. The maine one Was admiration first in young Agenor, (For by that name we know the Prince of Argos) Of our Leonidas wisedome, and his valour, Which though an enemy, first in him bred wonder; That liking, Love succeeded that, which was Followed by a desire to be a friend Upon what termes soever to such goodnesse; They had an enterview; and that their friendship Might with our peace be ratified, 'twas concluded, Agenor yeelding up all such stronge places As he held in our Territories, should receive (With a sufficient Dower, paid by the Queene) The faire Merione for his wife. Era. But how Approves the Queene of this? since we well know, Nor was her Highnesse ignorant, that her Sonne The Prince Theanor made love to this Lady, And in the noblest way. Nean. Which she allowed of, And I have heard from some familiar with Her neerest secrets, she so deeply priz'd her Being from an Infant train'd up in her service, (Or to speake better, rather her owne Creature) She once did say, That if the Prince should steale A Marriage without her leave, or knowledge, With this Merione, with a little suit She should grant both their pardons: where as now To shew her selfe forsooth a Spartan Lady, And that 'tis in her power, now it concernes The common good, not alone to subdue Her owne affections, but command her Sons; She has not onely forc'd him with rough threats To leave his Mistris, but compell'd him when Agenor made his entrance into Corinth To wait upon his Rivall. Sos. Can it be The Prince should sit downe with this wrong? Nean. I know not, I am sure I should not. Era. Trust me nor I, A Mother is a name, but put in ballance With a yong wench 'tis nothing; where did you leave him? Nean. Neere Vesta's Temple, for there he dismiss'd me, And full of troubled thoughts, calling for Crates: He went with him, but whither or to what purpose I am a stranger. Enter Theanor and Crates. Era. They are come backe Neanthes. The. I like the place well. Cra. Well Sir? it is built As if the Architect had been a Prophet, And fashion'd it alone for this nights action; The vaults so hollow, and the walls so strong, As Dian there might suffer violence, And with loud shrikes in vaine call Jove to helpe her; Or should he heare, his thunder could not finde An entrance to it. The. I give up my selfe Wholly to thy direction, worthiest Crates; And yet the desperate cure that we must practice Is in it selfe so foule, and full of danger, That I stand doubtfull whether 'twere more manly To dye not seeking helpe, or that helpe being So deadly, to pursue it. Cra. To those reasons I have already urg'd, I will adde these. For but consider Sir— Era. It is of weight What ere it be, that with such vehement action, Of eye, hand, foot, nay all his bodies motion, Crates incites the Prince to. Nean. Then observe, With what variety of passions he Receives his reasons; now he's pale, and shakes For feare or anger; now his naturall red Comes backe againe, and with a pleasing smile He seemes to entertaine it; 'tis resolv'd on Be it what 'twill: to his ends may it prosper Though the State sinke for't. Cra. Now you are a Prince Fit to rule others, and in shaking off The Bonds in which your Mother fetters you Discharge your debt to nature, she's your guide, Follow her boldly Sir. The. I am confirm'd, Fall what may fall, Cra. Yet still disguise your malice In your humility. The. I am instructed. Cra. Though in your heart there rage a thousand tempests, All calmenesse in your lookes. The. I shall remember. Cra. And at no hand, though these are us'd as agents Acquaint them with your purpose till the instant That we employ them; tis not fit they have Time to consider, when 'tis done, reward Or feare will keep them silent: yet you may Grace them as you passe by, 'twill make them surer, And greedier to deserve you. The. Ile move onely As you would have me: Good day gentlemen; Nay, spare this ceremonious forme of duty To him that brings love to you, equall love, And is in nothing happier, then in knowing It is return'd by you; we are as one. Sos. I am ore-joyd, I know not How to reply: but— Era. Hang all buts; my Lord, For this your bounteous favour— Nean. Let me speake, If to feed Vultures hereafter the halter Has done his part, or if there be a Hell To take a swindge or two there, may deserve this. Sos. We are ready. Era. Try us any way. Nean. Put us to it. The. What jewels I have in you? Cra. Have these soules, That for a good looke, and a few kinde words Part with their essence? The. Since you will compell me To put that to the tryall, which I doubt not, Crates may be suddenly will instruct you How, and in what to shew your loves; obey him As you would binde me to you. Cra. Tis well grounded; Leave me to reare the building. Nean. We will doe. Cra. I know it. Era. Any thing youl put us to. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Leonidas, Merione, Beliza, Servant. Leo. Sister, I reape the harvest of my labours In your preferment, be you worthy of it, And with an open bosome entertaine A greater fortune then my love durst hope for; Be wise, and welcome it: play not the coy And foolish wanton, with the offerd bounties Of him that is a Prince. I was woo'd for you, And won Merione: then if you dare Beleeve the object that tooke me was worthy, Or trust my judgement, in me think you were Courted, sued to, and conquerd. Mer. Noble brother, I have, and still esteeme you as a Father, And will as farre obey you; my heart speakes it: And yet without your anger give me leave To say, That in the choice of that on which All my lifes joyes or sorrowes have dependance, It had been fit ere you had made a full And absolute grant of me to any other, I should have us'd mine owne eyes, or at least Made you to understand, whether it were Within my power to make a second gift Of my poore selfe. Leo. I know what tis you point at, The Prince Theanos love; let not that cheat you; His vowes were but meere courtship; all his service But practise how to entrap a credulous Lady: Or grant it serious, yet you must remember He's not to love but where the Queene his Mother Must give allowance, which to you is barr'd up: And therefore study to forget that ever You cherisht such a hope. Mer. I would I could. Leo. But brave Agenor, who is come in person To celebrate this Marriage, for your love Forgives the forfeit of ten thousand lives, That must have falne under the sword of war Had not this peace been made; which generall good Both Countries owe to his affection to you: O happy Sister, aske this noble Lady Your bosome friend (since I faile in my credit) What palme Agenors name above all Princes That Greece is proud of carries, and with lustre. Rel. Indeed fame gives him out for excellent; And friend, I doubt not but when you shall see him He'l so appeare to you. Art sure 'tis he? Ser. As I live Madam— Bel. Vertue enable me to containe my joy. 'Tis my Euphanes. Ser. Yes. Bel. And he's in health? Ser. Most certainly Madam, Bel. Ile see him instantly. So prethee tell him. Exit Ser. Mer. I yeeld my selfe too weake In argument to oppose you: you may leade me Whither you please. Leo. 'Tis answer'd like my Sister; And if in him you finde not ample cause To pray for me, and daily on your knees, Conclude I have no judgement. Mer. May it prove so: Friend, shall we have your company? Bel. Two houres hence I will not faile you. Leo. At your pleasure Madam. Exit Leo. and Mer. Enter Euphanes. Bel. Could I in one word speake a thousand welcomes (And hearty ones) you have 'em: Fie, my hand, We stand at no such distance, by my life The parting kisse you tooke before your travell Is yet a virgin on my lips, preserv'd With as much care as I would doe my fame, To entertaine your wish'd returne. Euph. Best Lady, That I doe honour you, and with as much reason As ever man did vertue; that I love you, Yet looke upon you with that reverence As holy men behold the Sun, the Starrs, The Temples, and their gods, they all can witnesse; And that you have deserv'd this duty from me; The life, and meanes of life, for which I owe you, Commands me to professe it, since my fortune Affords no other payment. Bel. Good Euphanes, where benefits are ill conferr'd, I had thought, That for the trifling courtesies as I call them, (Though you give them another name) you had Made ample satisfaction in th'acceptance, And therefore did presume you had brought home Some other Language. Euph. No one I have learn'd Yeelds words sufficient to expresse your goodnesse; Nor can I ever chuse another theame And not be thought unthankfull. Bel. Pray you no more As you respect me. Euph. That charme is too powerfull For me to disobey it; 'Tis your pleasure, And not my boldnesse Madam. Bel. Good Euphanes, Beleeve I am not one of those weak Ladies, That (barren of all inward worth) are proud Of what they cannot truly call their owne, Their birth or fortune, which are things without them, Nor in this will I imitate the world, Whose greater part of men think when they give They purchase bondmen, not make worthy friends: By all that's good I sweare, I never thought My great estate was an addition to me, Or that your wants took from you. Euph. There are few So truly understanding or themselves Or what they doe possesse. Bel. Good Euphanes, Where benefits Are ill conferr'd, as to unworthy men, That turne them to bad uses, the bestower For wanting judgement how, and on whom to place them, Is partly guilty: but when we do favours To such as make them grounds on which they build Their noble actions, there we improve our fortunes To the most faire advantage. If I speake Too much, though I confesse I speak well, Prethee remember 'tis a womans weaknesse, And then thou wilt forgive it. Euph. You speake nothing But what would well become the wisest man: And that by you deliver'd is so pleasing That I could heare you ever. Bel. Fly not from Your word, for I arrest it: and will now Expresse my selfe a little more, and prove That whereas you professe your selfe my debtor, That I am yours. Euph. Your Ladiship then must use Some Sophistry I ne're heard of. Bel. By plaine reasons, For looke you, had you never sunk beneath Your wants, or if those wants had found supply From Crates, your unkinde and covetous brother, Or any other man, I then had miss'd A subject upon which I worthily Might exercise my bounty: whereas now By having happy opportunity To furnish you before, and in your travells, With all conveniencies that you thought usefull, That Gold which would have rusted in my Coffers Being thus imploy'd, has rendred me a partner In all your glorious actions. And whereas Had you not been, I should have di'd a thing Scarce knowne, or soone forgotten: there's no Trophy In which Euphanes for his worth is mentioned, But there you have been carefull to remember, That all the good you did came from Beliza. Euph. That was but thankfulnesse. Bel. 'Twas such an honour, And such a large returne for the poore trash. I ventur'd with you, that if I should part With all that I possesse, and my selfe too In satisfaction for it, 'twere still short Of your deservings. Euph. You o're-prize them Madam. Bel. The Queen her selfe hath given me gracious thanks In your behalfe, for she hath heard Euphanes How gallantly you have maintain'd her honour In all the Courts of Greece: and rest assur'd, (Though yet unknown) when I present you to her, Which I will doe this evening, you shall finde That she intends good to you. Euph. Worthiest Lady, Since all you labour for is the advancement Of him that will live ever your poore servant, He must not contradict it. Bel. Here's your Brother, 'Tis strange to see him here. Enter Crates. Cra. You are welcome home Sir, (Your pardon Madam) I had thought my house, Considering who I am, might have been worthy Of your first visit. Euph. 'Twas not open to me When last I saw you; and to me 'tis wonder That absence which still renders men forgotten Should make my presence wish'd for. Bel. That's not it, Your too kinde Brother understanding that You stand in no need of him, is bold to offer His entertainment. Cra. He had never wanted, Or yours, or your assistance, had he practiz'd The way he might have tooke, to have commanded What ever I call mine, Euph. I studied many, But could finde none. Cra. You would not finde your selfe Sir, Or in your selfe what was from you due to me: The priviledge my birth bestow'd upon me Might challenge some regard. Euph. You had all the Land Sir, What else did you expect? and I am certaine You kept such strong Guards to preserve it yours I could force nothing from you. Cra. Did you ever Demand helpe from me? Euph. My wants have, and often, With open mouthes, but you nor heard, nor saw them; May be you look'd I should petition to you As you went to your Horse; flatter your servants, To play the Brokers for my furtherance, Sooth your worse humours, Act the Parasite On all occasions, write my name with theirs That are but one degree remov'd from slaves, Be drunk when you would have me, then wench with you, Or play the Pander; enter into Quarrels Although unjustly grounded, and defend them Because they were yours; these are the tyrannies Most younger Brothers groane beneath; yet beare them From the insulting Heire, selling their freedomes At a lesse rate then what the State allowes, The sallary of base and common Strumpets: For my part, ere on such low termes I feed Upon a Brothers trencher, let me dye The Beggers death, and starve. Cra. 'Tis bravely spoken, Did what you doe ranke with it. Bel. Why, what does he You would not wish were yours? Cra. Ile tell you Lady, Since you rise up his Advocate, and boldly, (For now I finde, and plainly, in whose favour My love and service to you was neglected) For all your wealth, nay, adde to that your beauty, And put your vertues in if you have any, I would not yet be pointed at, as he is, For the fine Courtier, the womans man, That tells my Lady stories, dissolves riddles, Ushers her to her Coach, lyes at her feet At sollemne Maskes, applauding what she laughs at; Reads her asleep a nights, and takes his oath Upon her Pantossles, that all excellence In other Madams doe but zany hers: These you are perfect in, and yet these take not Or from your birth or freedome. Euph. Should another Say this, my deeds, not lookes should shew— Bel. Contemne it: His envie faines this, and he's but reporter, Without a second, of his owne dry fancies. Cra. Yes Madam, the whole City speakes it with me, And though it may distaste, 'tis certaine you Are brought into the sceane, and with him censur'd; For you are given out for the provident Lady, That not to be unfurnish'd for her pleasures (As without them to what vaine use is greatnesse) Have made choyce of an able man, a young man Of an Herculean back to doe you service, And one you may command too, that is active, And does what you would have him. Bel. You are foule mouth'd. Cra. That can speake well, write Verses too, and good ones, Sharp and conceited, whose wit you may lie with When his performance failes him; one you have Maintain'd abroad to learne new waies to please you, And by the gods you well reward him for it, No night (in which while you lye sick and panting) He watches by you but is worth a tallent: No conference in your Coach which is not paid with A scarlet Suit; this the poore people mutter, Though I beleeve, for I am bound to doe so, A Lady of your youth, that feeds high too, And a most exact Lady, may doe all this Out of a vertuous love, the last bought vizard That Leachery purchas'd. Euph. Not a word beyond this, The reverence I owe to that one wombe In which we both were embrions, makes me suffer What's past; but if continued— Bel. Stay your hand, The Queene shall right mine honour. Cra. Let him doe it, It is but marrying him; and for your anger Know that I slight it: when your Goddesse here Is weary of your sacrifice, as she will be, You know my house, and there amongst my servants Perhaps youl finde a livery. Exit. Bel. Be not mov'd, I know the rancour of his disposition, And turne it on himselfe by laughing at it, And in that let me teach you. Euph. I learne gladly. Exeunt. Scæna Tertia. Enter Neanthes, Sosines, and Eraton, severally. Nea. You are met unto my wishes, if you ever Desir'd true mirth so far as to adventure To dye with the extreamity of laughter, I come before the object that will doe it; Or let me live your foole. Sos. Who is't Neanthes? Nea. Lamprias the Usurers sonne. Era. Lamprias? the youth Of six and fifty? Sos. That was sent to travell By rich Beliza, till he came to age, And was fit for a Wife? Nea. The very same, This gallant with his Guardian, and his Tutor, (And of the three who is most foole I know not) Are newly come to Corinth, ile not stale them By giving up their characters, but leave you To make your owne discoveries: here they are Sir. Enter Onos Unckle and Tutor. Tutor. That legge a little higher; very well. Now put your face into the Travellors posture; Exceeding good. Vnckle. Doe you mark how they admire him? Tut. They will be all my Schollars, when they know And understand him truly. Era. Phœbus guard me From this new Python. Sos. How they have trimm'd him up Like an old Reveller? Nea. Curl'd him and perfum'd him, But that was done with judgement, for he lookes Like one that purg'd perpetually; trust me, That Witches face of his is painted too, And every ditch upon it buries more Then would set off ten Bawds, and all their tenants. Sos. See how it moves towards us. Nea. There's a salutation: 'Troth Gentlemen, you have bestowed much travell In trayning up your Pupill. Tut. Sir, great buildings Require great labours, which yet we repent not, Since for the Countries good we have brought home An absolute man. Unc. As any of his yeares, Corinth can shew you. Era. He's exceeding meagre. Tut. His contemplation— Unc. Besides, 'tis fit Learners should be kept hungry. Nea. You all contemplate; For three such wretched pictures of leane famine I never saw together. Unc. We have fat minds Sir, And travell'd to save charges. Doe you thinke 'Twas fit a young and hopefull Gentleman Should be brought up a glutton? he's my Ward, Nor was there ever where I bore the bagg Any superfluous waste. Era. Pray you can it speake? Tut. He knowes all Languages, but will use none, They are all too big for his mouth, or else too little T'expresse his great conceits: and yet of late With some ippulsion he hath set downe In a strange method by the way of question, And briefly, to all businesse whatsoever That may concerne a Gentleman. Nea. Good Sir, let's heare him. Tut. Come on Sir. Nea. They have taught him like an Ape, To doe his tricks by signes: now he begins. Onos. When shall we be drunke together? Tut. That's the first. Onos. Where shall we whore to night? Uncle. That ever followes. Era. 'Odds me, he now lookes angry. Onos. Shall we quarrell? Nea. With me at no hand Sir. Onos. Then let's protest. Era. Is this all? Tut. These are Sir, the foure new Vertues That are in fashion: many a mile we measur'd Before we could arrive unto this knowledge. Nea. You might have spar'd that labour, for at home here Ther's little else in practice: Ha? the Queene? Good friends, for halfe an houre remove your motion, To morrow willingly when we have more leasure We'l looke on him againe. Onos. Did I not rarely? Uncle. Excellent well. Tut. He shall have sixe Plumbs for it. Exeunt. Anter Agenor, Leonidas, Theanor, Queene, Merione, Beliza, Euphanes, Crates, Ladies, attendants with Lights. Queene. How much my Court is honour'd princely Brother In your vouchafing it your long'd for presence Were tedious to repeat, since 'tis already (And heartily) acknowledg'd; may the gods That looke into Kings actions smile upon The league we have concluded; and their justice Finde me out to revenge it if I breake One article. Age. Great miracle of Queenes, How happy I esteeme my selfe in being Thought worthy to be numbred in the rank Of your confederates, my love and best service Shall teach the world hereafter: but this gift With which you have confirm'd it, is so farre Beyond my hopes and meanes ere to returne, That of necessity I must dye oblig'd To your unanswer'd bounty. The. The sweet Lady In blushes gives your Highnesse thankes. Quee. Beleeve it On the Queenes word, she is a worthy one, And I am so acquainted with her goodnesse, That but for this peace that hath chang'd my purpose, And to her more advancement, I should gladly Have call'd her Daughter. The. Though I am depriv'd of A blessing 'tis not in the Fates to equall, To shew my selfe a subject as a sonne, Here I give up my claime, and willingly With mine owne hand deliver you what once I lov'd above my selfe; and from this houre (For my affection yeelds now to my duty) Vow never to sollicite her. Cra. 'Tis well cover'd Neanthes, and the rest. Exit Cra. Nea. Sos. Era. Quee. Nay, for this night You must (for 'tis our Country fashion Sir) Leave her to her devotions, in the morning We'l bring you to the Temple. Leo. How in this Your Highnesse honours me? Mer. Sweet rest to all. Age. This kisse, and I obey you. Bel. Please it your Highnesse, This is the Gentleman. Quee. You are welcome home Sir, (Now as I live, one of a promising presence) I have heard of you before, and you shall finde Ile know you better: finde out something that May doe you good, and rest assur'd to have it.

Exeunt. Enter Crates, Neanthes, Eraton, Sosicles disguiz'd. Cra. She must passe through this Cloyster, suddainly And boldly seaze upon her. Nea. Where's the Prince? Cra. He does expect us at the place I shew'd you. Enter Merione and Servant. I heare ones footing, peace, 'tis she; Mer. Now leave me, I know the way, though Vesta witnesse with me I never trod it with such feare: helpe, helpe. Cra. Stop her mouth close, out with the Light, ile guide you. Exeunt.</field>

Deafe, deafe, you gods of goodnesse, deafe to me, Deafe Heaven to all my cryes; deafe hope, deafe justice, I am abus'd, and you that see all saw it; Saw it, and smil'd upon the villaine did it: Saw it, and gave him strength: why have I pray'd to ye, When all the worlds eyes have been sunk in slumbers? Why have I then powr'd out my teares? kneel'd to ye? And from the Altar of a pure heart sent ye Thoughts like your selves, white, innocent, vowes purer And of a sweeter flame then all earths odours? Why have I sung your praises, strew'd your Temples, And Crown'd your holy Priests with Virgin Roses? Is it we hold ye powerfull, to destroy us? Beleeve, and honour ye, to see us ruin'd? These teares of anger thus I sprinckle toward ye, You that dare sleep secure whilst Virgins suffer, These stick like Comets, blaze eternally, Till with the wonder they have wak't your justice, And forc't ye feare our curses, as we yours. Enter Theanor, Crates with Vizards. My shame still followes me, and still proclames me; He turnes away in scorne, I am contemned too, A more unmanly violence then the other; Bitten, and flung away? What ere you are Sir, you that have abus'd me, and now most basely And sacrilegiously rob'd this faire Temple, I fling all these behinde me, but looke upon me, But one kinde loving look, be what ye will, So from this hower you will be mine, my Husband; And you his hand in mischiefe, I speake to you too, Counsell him nobly now; you know the mischief, The most unrighteous act he has done, perswade him, Perswade him like a friend, knock at his Conscience Till faire Repentance follow: yet be worthy of me, And shew your self, if ever good thought guided ye, You have had your foul will, make it yet fair with marriage; Open your self and take me, wed me now: Draws his Dagger. More fruits of Villany? your Dagger? come Ye are mercifull, I thank ye for your medicine: Is that too worthy too? Enter the rest disguis'd. Devill, thou with him, Thou penny Bawd to his Lust, will not that stir thee? Do you work by tokens now? Be sure I live not, For your owne safeties knaves. I will sit patiently: But as ye are true Villaines, the Devills owne servants, And those he loves and trusts, make it as bloody An Act, of such true horrour Heaven would shake at, 'Twill shew the braver: goodnesse hold my hope fast, And in thy mercies looke upon my ruines, And then I am right: my eyes grow dead and heavy: Enter sixe disguis'd, singing and dancing to a horrid Musick, and sprinkling water on her face. Wrong me no more as ye are men. The. She is fast. Cra. Away with her. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Agenor, and Gentlemen with Torches. Ag. Now Gentlemen, the time's come now t'enjoy That fruitfull happinesse my heart has long'd for: This day be happy call'd, and when old Time Brings it about each yeare, crown'd with that sweetnesse It gives me now, see every man observe it, And laying all aside beares shew of businesse, Give this to joy and triumph: How sits my cloaths? 1 Gent. Handsome, and wondrous well Sir. Ag. Do they shew richly? For to those curious eyes even beauty envies, I must not now appeare poore, or low fashion'd; Me thinks I am younger then I was, farre younger; And such a promise in my bloud I feele now, That if there may be a perpetuall youth Bestowed on man, I am that soule shall win it: Do's my haire stand well, Lord how ill-favourdly You have drest me to day? how baldly? why this Cloke? 2 Gent. Why 'tis the richest Sir. Ag. And here ye have put me on A paire of Breeches look like a paire of Bagpipes. 1 Gent. Beleeve Sir, they shew bravely. Ag. Why these Stockings? 2 Gent. Your Legg appeares— Ag. Peuh I would have had 'em peach collour, All young, and new about me: and this Scarfe here A goodly thing: you have trickt me like a Puppet. 1 Gent. Ile undertake to rig forth a whole Navie, And with lesse labour then one man in love, They are never pleas'd. 2 Gent. Me thinks he lookes well. 1 Gent. Well As man can looke, as handsome: now do I wonder He found not fault his Nose was put on ugly, Or his Eyes lookt too gray, and rayle at us, They are the waywards things, these Lovers. 2 Gent. All will be right When once it comes to th'push. 1 Gent. I would they were at it For our owne quiet sake. Ag. Come, wait upon me, And beare your selves like mine, my friends, and nobly. Ex.

Be not you stirr'd now, but away to your Mother, Give all attendance, let no staine appeare Of feare, or doubt in your face: carry your selfe confidently. The. But whither runs your drift now? Cra. When she wakes, Either what's done will shew a meere dreame to her, And carry no more credit: or say she finde it, Say she remember all the circumstances, Twenty to one the shapes in which they were acted, The horrours, and the still affrights we shew'd her, Rising in wilder figures to her memory Will run her mad, and no man ghesse the reason: If all these faile, and that she rise up perfect, And so collect her selfe, beleeve this Sir, Not knowing who it was that did this to her, Nor having any power to ghesse; the thing done too, Being the utter undoing of her Honour If it be knowne, and to the worlds eye publish'd, Especially at this time when Fortune courts her, She must and will conceale it; nay, forget it, The woman is no Lucrece; get you gone Sir, And as you would have more of this sport, feare not. The. I am confirm'd, farewell. Cra. Farewell, away Sir: Disperse your selves, and as you love his favour, And that that crowns it, Gold, no tongues amongst ye.

How fares your Sister, My beauteous Mistris, what is she ready yet? Leo. No doubt she'l lose no time Sir, yong Maids in her way Tread upon thornes, and think an houre an age Till the Priest has done his part, that theirs may follow: I saw her not since yesterday ith' evening: But Sir, I am sure she is not slack; beleeve me, Your grace will finde a loving soule. Ag. A sweet one, And so much joy I carry in the thought of it, So great a happinesse to know she is mine; Beleeve me noble Brother, that to expresse it Me thinkes a Tongue's a poore thing, can do nothing, Imagination lesse: who's that that lies there? Leo. Where Sir? Ag. Before the doore, it lookes like a woman: Leo. This way I came abroad, but then there was nothing, One of the Maids o're-watch'd belike. Ag. It may be. Leo. But me thinks this is no fit place to sleep in. 1 Gent. 'Tis sure a woman Sir, she has Jewels on too: She feares no foule play sure. Leo. Bring a Torch hither, Yet 'tis not perfect day: I should know those Garments. Ag. How sound she sleepes? Leo. I am sorry to see this. Ag. Do you know her? Leo. And you now I am sure Sir. Ag.

Enter the house Sir, and bring out your Mistris, You must observe our Ceremonies: what's the matter? What's that ye stand at? How Merione? Asleep i'th street? belike some sudden Palsie As she stept out last night upon devotion, To tooke her farewell of her Virgin state, The Ayre being sharp and piercing, struck her suddenly: See if she breath. Leo. A little. Quee. Wake her then, 'Tis sure a fit. Ag. She wakes her selfe, Give roome to her. Quee. See how the spirits struggle to recover, And strongly re-inforce their strengths; for certaine This was no naturall sleep. The. I am of your minde Madam. Quee. No Sonne, it cannot be. The. Pray Heaven no trick in't; Good soule she little merits such a mischiefe. Quee. She is broad awake now, and her sence clears up, 'Twas sure a fit; stand off. Mer. The Queene, my Love here, And all my noble friends? Why where am I? How am I traunc'd, and moaped? i'th street? Heaven blesse me, Shame to my Sex; o'th ground too? O, I remember— Leo. How wilde she lookes? Ag. Oh my cold heart, how she trembles? Mer. O I remember, I remember. Quee. What's that? Mer. My shame, my shame, my shame: O I remember My never-dying shame. The. Here has been villainie. Quee. I feare so to. Mer. You are no Furies are ye? No horrid shapes sent to affright me? Ag. No sweet, We are your friends: looke up, I am Agenor, O my Merione, that loves you dearely: And come to marry ye. Leo. Sister, what ayle ye? Speake out your griefes, and boldly— Ag. Something sticks here Will choake ye else. Mer. I hope it will. Quee. Be free Lady, You have your loving friends about ye. Ag. Deare Merione, By the unspotted love I ever bore ye, By thine owne goodnesse— Mer. O 'tis gone, 'tis gone Sir, I am now I know not what: pray ye look not on me, No name is left me, nothing to inherit But that detested, base, and branded— Ag. Speake it, And how; diseases of most danger Their causes once discover'd are easily cur'd: My faire Merione. Mer. I thanke your love Sir; When I was faire Merione, unspotted, Pure, and unblasted in the bud you honour'd, White as the heart of truth, then Prince Agenor, Even then I was not worthy of your favour; Wretch that I am, lesse worthy now of pitty: Let no good thing come neare me, vertue fly me; You that have honest noble names despise me, For I am nothing now but a maine pestilence Able to poyson all. Send those unto me That have forgot their names, ruin'd their fortunes, Despis'd their honours; those that have been Virgins Ravish'd and wrong'd, and yet dare live to tell it. The. Now it appeares too plaine. Mer. Send those sad people That hate the light, and curse society; Whose thoughts are Graves, and from whose eyes continually Their melting soules drop out, send those to me; And when their sorrowes are most excellent, So full that one griefe more cannot be added, My Story like a torrent shall devoure 'em. Hark, it must out; but pray stand close together, And let not all the world heare. Leo. Speake it boldly. Mer. And Royall Lady, think but charitably, Your Grace has known my breeding. Quee. Prethee speake it. Mer. Is there no stranger here? send off your servants, And yet it must be knowne: I shake. Ag. Sweet Mistris. Mer. I am abus'd, basely abus'd; do you ghesse yet? Come close ile tell ye plainer; I am Whor'd, Ravish'd, and robb'd of Honour. Leo. O the Divell. Ag. What hellish Slave was this? The. A wretch, a wretch, A damned wretch: do you know the Villaine Lady? Mer. No. The. Not by ghesse? Mer. O no. The. It must be knowne. Quee. Where was the place? Mer. I know not neither. Ag. O Heaven, Is this the happy time? my hope to this come? Leo. Neither the man, nor circumstances? The. His tongue, Did you not heare his tongue, no voice? Mer. None, none Sir: All I know of him was his violence. Ag. How came ye hither Sweet? Mer. I know not neither. The. A cunning piece of Villany. Mer. All I remember Is onely this: Going to Vestas Temple To give the Goddesse my last Virgin prayers, Neere to that place I was suddenly surpris'd, By five or sixe disguis'd, and from thence violently To my dishonour hal'd: that Act perform'd, Brought back, but how, or whether, till I wak'd here.— The. This is so monstrous the gods cannot suffer it; I have not read in all the villanies Committed by the most obdurate Rascalls, An act so truly impious. Leo. Would I knew him. The. He must be known, the Devill cannot hide him. Quee. If all the Art I have, or power can do it, He shall be found, and such a way of justice Inflicted on him: A Lady wrong'd in my Court, And this way rob'd, and ruin'd? The. Be contented Madam, If he be above ground I will have him. Ag. Faire vertuous Maid, take comfort yet and flourish, In my love flourish: the staine was forc'd upon ye None of your wills, nor yours; rise, and rise mine still, And rise the same white, sweet, faire soule, I lov'd ye, Take me the same. Mer. I kneele and thank ye Sir, And I must say ye are truly honourable, And dare confesse my will yet still a Virgin; But so unfit and weak a Cabinet To keep your love and vertue in am I now, That have been forc'd and broken, lost my lustre, I meane this body, so corrupt a Volume For you to study goodnesse in, and honour, I shall intreat your Grace, conferre that happinesse Upon a beauty sorrow never saw yet: And when this griefe shall kill me, as it must do, Only remember yet ye had such a Mistris; And if ye then dare shed a teare, yet honour me: Good Gentlemen expresse your pitties to me, In seeking out this villany; and my last suit Is to your Grace, that I may have your favour To live a poore recluse Nun with this Lady, From Court and Company, till Heaven shall heare me, And send me comfort, or death end my misery. Que. Take your own will, my very heart bleeds for thee. Ag. Farewell Merione, since I have not thee Ile wed thy goodnesse, and thy memory. Leo. And I her faire revenge. The. Away: let's follow it, For he is so rank i'th wind we cannot misse him. Exeunt. Scæna Quarta. Enter Crates and Conon. Cra.

Pray ye do me the honour To make my poore house first— Con. Pray Sir excuse me, I have not seene mine owne yet; nor made happy These longing eyes with those I love there: what's this a Taverne? Cra. It seemes so by the outside. Con. Step in here then, And since it offers it selfe so freely to us, A place made only for liberall entertainment, Let's seeke no further but make use of this, And after the Greek fashion, to our friends Crown a round cup or two. Enter Vintner and drawer. Cra. Your pleasure Sir. Drawers, who waits within? Draw. Anon, anon Sir. Vint. Look into the Lilly-pot: why Mark there; You are welcome Gentlemen; heartily welcome My noble friend. Cra. Let's have good Wine mine Host, And a fine private roome. Vint. Will ye be there Sir?

Ile draw ye that shall dance. Cra. Away, be quick then. Exit Vintner. Con. How does your Brother Sir, my noble friend The good Euphanes? in all my course of travell I met not with a Gentleman so furnish'd In gentlenesse and courtesie; beleeve Sir, So many friendly Offices I receiv'd from him, So great, and timely, and enjoy'd his company In such an open and a liberall sweetnesse, That when I dare forget him— Cra. He's in good health Sir, But you will finde him a much alter'd man, Growne a great Courtier Sir. Con. He's worthy of it. Cra. A man drawne up, that leaves no print behind him Of what he was: those goodnesses you speake of That have been in him, those that you call freedomes, Societies, and sweetnesse, looke for now Sir, You'le finde no shadowes of them left, no sound, The very Ayre he has liv'd in alter'd: now behold him, And you shall see a thing walk by, looke big upon ye, And cry for place; I am the Queenes, give roome there: If you bow low, may be he'l touch the Bonnet, Or fling a forced smile at ye for a favour. Con. He is your brother Sir. Cra. These formes put off, Which travell, and Court Holy-water sprinkle on him, I dare accept, and know him: you'l think it strange Sir, That even to me, to me his naturall Brother, And one by birth he owes a little honour too— Enter Vintner with Wine. (But that's all one) come give me some Wine, mine Host, Here's to your faire returne. Con. I wonder at it, But sure he has found a nature not worth owning In this way; else I know he is tender carried. I thank ye Sir: and now durst I presume For all you tell me of these alterations, And stops in his sweet nature, which till I finde so, I have known him now so long, &amp; look'd so through him, You must give me leave to be a little faithlesse: I say for all these, if you please to venter Ile lay the Wine we drink, let me send for him (Even I that am the poorest of his fellowship) But by a Boy oth' house too, let him have businesse, Let him attend the Queene, nay let his Mistris Hold him betwixt her armes, he shall come to me, And shall drink with me too; love me, and heartily, Like a true honest man bid me welcome home. I am confident. Cra. You will lose. Con. You'l stand toth' wager? Cra. With all my heart. Con. Go Boy, and tell Euphanes. Boy. He's now gone up the street Sir, With a great traine of Gallants. Cra. What think you now Sir? Con. Go, and overtake him, Commend my love unto him: my name is Conon, Tell him I am new arriv'd, and where I am, And would request to see him presently: Ye see I use old dudgen phrase to draw him. Cra. Ile hang and quarter when you draw him hether. Con. Away Boy. Boy. I am gone Sir. Exit. Con. Here's to you now, And you shall finde his travell has not stopt him As you suppose, nor alter'd any freedome, But made him far more cleare and excellent; It drawes the grosnesse off the understanding, And renders active and industrious spirits: He that knowes most mens manners, must of necessity Best know his owne, and mend those by example: 'Tis a dull thing to travell like a Mill-horse, Still in the place he was borne in, lam'd and blinded; Living at home is like it: pure and strong spirits That like the Fire still covet to fly upward, And to give fire as well as take it; cas'd up, and mewd here I meane at home, like lusty metled Horses, Onely ty'd up in Stables, to please their Masters, Beat out their fiery lives in their owne Litters, Why doe not you travell Sir? Cra. I have no beliefe in't I see so many strange things, halfe unhatcht, to Returne, those that went out men, and good men, They looke like potch'd Eggs with the soules suckt out, Empty and full of wind: all their affections Are bak'd in Rye crust, to hold carriage From this good Towne toth' other: and when they are open'd, They are so ill cooked and mouldy— Con. Ye are pleasant. Cra. Ile shew ye a pack of these: I have 'em for ye, That have been long in travell too. Con. Please you Sir. Cra. You know the Merchants walk, Boy? 2 Boy. Very well. Cra. And you remember those Gentlemen were here The other day with me? 2 Boy. Yes. Cra. Then go thither, For there I am sure they are, pray 'em come hither, (And use my name) I would be glad to see 'em. Enter 1 Boy. 1 Boy. Your Brother's comming in Sir. Vint. Odds my passion, Out with the Plate ye knaves: bring the new Quishions, And wash those Glasses I set by for high dayes, Perfume the roomes along, why Sirrah. 1 Boy. Here Sir. Vint. Bid my Wife make her selfe ready handsomely, And put on her best Apron: it may be The noble Gentleman will looke upon her. Enter Euphanes and two Gentlemen. Euph. Where is he Boy? Vint. Your worship's heartily welcome, It joyes my very heart to see ye here Sir. The Gentleman that sent for your Honour— Euph. O good mine Host. Vint. To my poor homely house, and't like your honor. Euph. I thank thine honour good mine Host, where is he? Con. What think ye now? my best Euphanes. Euph. Conon, welcome my friend, my noble friend how is it? Are you in safety come, in health? Con.

Enter the 2. Boy. I am glad I am come home. 2 Boy. Here are the Gentlemen. Cra. O let 'em enter: now you that trust in travell, And make sharp Beards, and little Breeches Deities, You that inhaunce the daily price of Tooth-picks, And hold there is no homebred hapinesse, Behold a modell of your minds and actions. Euph. Though this be envious, yet done ith' way of mirth, I am content to thank ye for't. Con. 'Tis well yet. Cra. Let the Maske enter. Enter Onos, his Unckle and Tutor. Onos.

Tut. Durus me hercle pater. Con. What Mounsieur Onos, the very pump of travell, Sir, as I live you have done me the greatest kindnesse, O my faire Sir, Lampree, the carefull Unckle To this young hopefull issue; Mounsieur Tutor too, The father to his minde; Come, come, let's hug Boyes, Why what a bunch of travell doe I embrace now, Me thinkes I put a Girdle about Europe; How has the Boy profited? Vnc. He has enough Sir, If his too fiery mettle doe not mar it. Con. Is he not thrifty yet? Tut. That's all his fault, Too bounteous minded being under age too, A great consumer of his stock in Pippins, Had ever a hot stomack. Con. Come hither Onos, Will you love me for this fine Apple? Onos. We. Con. And will ye be rul'd by me sometimes? Onos. 'Faith I will. Con. That's a good Boy. Unc. Pray give not the childe so much fruit, He's of a raw Complexion. Euph. You Mounsieur hard egge, Do you remember me? Doe you remember When you and your Consort travell'd through Hungary? Con. He's in that circuit still. Euph. Do you remember The cantell of immortall Cheese ye carried with ye, The halfe cold Cabbedge, in a leather Sachell, And those invincible Eggs that would lye in your bowells A fortnight together, and then turne to bedstaves; Your sowre milk that would choak an Irish man, And bread was bak'd in Cæsars time for the Army? Con. Providence, providence. Tut. The soule of travell. Euph. Can the Boy speak yet? Tut. Yes, and as fine a Gentleman, I thanke my able knowledge, he has arriv'd at, Only a little sparing of his Language, Which every man of observation— Unc. And of as many tongues. Tut.

The White horse Sir, There where I lye; honest and a just beast, Tut. O Caput lepidum: a Childe to say this, Are these figures for the mouthes of Infants? Con. Onos, what wenches? Come, tell me true. On. I cannot speake without booke. Con. When shall we have one, ha? On. Steale me from mine Unckle, For looke you, I am broke out horribly For want of fleshly Phisick: they say I am too yong, And that 'twill spoyle my growth but could you help me? Con. Meet me to morrow man, no more. Euph. You thinke now Ye have open'd such a shame to me of travell, By shewing these thin Cubbs: ye have honour'd us Against your will, proclam'd us excellent: Three Frailes of Sprats carried from Mart, to Mart, Are as much meat as these, to more use travell'd; A bunch of bloted fooles: me thinkes your judgement Should looke abroad sometimes without your envie. Cra. Such are most of you: so I take my leave, And when you finde your womens favour faile, 'Tis ten to one you'l know your selfe, and seeke me Upon a better Muster of your manners. Con.

That thing they would keep in everlasting nonage, My Brother for his owne ends has thrust on Upon my Mistris, 'tis true, he shall be rich If ever he can get that Rogue his Unckle To let him be of yeares to come to inherit it, Now what the maine drift is— Con. Say ye so? no more words, Ile keepe him company till he be of yeares, Though it be a hundred yeares, but ile discover it; And ten to one ile crosse it too. Euph. You are honest, And I shall study still your love: farewell Sir, For these few houres I must desire your pardon, I have businesse of importance: once a day At least I hope you'l see me: I must see you else: So, once more ye are welcome. Con. All my thankes Sir, And when I leave to love you, life go from me. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Scæna Prima. Enter Theanor and Crates. Cra. Why Sir, the Kingdomes his, and no man now Can come to Corinth, or from Corinth goe Without his Licence; he puts up the tithes Of every Office through Achaia; From Courtier to the Carter hold of him: Our Lands, our Liberties, nay very lives Are shut up in his Closet, and let loose But at his pleasure; Bookes, and all discourse Have now no Patron, nor direction, But glorifi'd Euphanes: our Cups are guilty That quench our thirsts, if not unto his health: Oh, I could eat my heart, and fling away My very soule for anguish: gods, nor men Should tollerate such disproportion. The. And yet is he belov'd: whether't be vertue, Or seeming vertue which he makes the cloake To his ambition. Cra. Be it which it will: Your Highnesse is to tame, your eyes too film'd To see this, and sit still: the Lion should not Tremble to heare the bellowing of the Bull; Nature excuse me, though he be my Brother, You are my Countries Father, therefore mine: One paralell line of Love I bend on him, All lines of love and duty meet in you As in their Center: therefore heare, and weigh What I shall speake: You know the Queen your Mother Did from a private state your Father raise, So all your Royalty you hold from her; She is older then she was, therefore more doating, And what know we but blindnesse of her love (That hath from underneath the foot of fortune Set, even Euphanes foot, on fortunes head) Will take him by the hand, and cry, Leap now Into my bed; 'tis but a trick of age; Nothing impossible. The. What do you infer on this? Cra. Your pardon Sir: With reverence to the Queen; yet why should I Feare to speak plaine what pointeth to your good? A good old Widow is a hungry thing, (I speak of other Widows, not of Queens.) The. Speak to thy purpose. Cra. I approach it: Sir, Should young Euphanes claspe the Kingdome thus, And please the good old Lady some one night; What might not she be wrought to put on you, Quite to supplant your birth? neither is she Past children, as I take it. The. Crates, Thou shak'st me; Thou, that dost hate thy Brother for my love, In my love finde one; henceforth be my brother: This Gyant I will fell beneath the earth; I will shine out, and melt his artfull wings: Euphanes, from my mothers sea of favours Spreads like a River, and runs calmly on, Secure yet from my stormes; like a young pine He growes up planted under a faire Oake, Whose strong large branches yet do's shelter him, And every Traveller admires his beauty; But like a winde, ile work into his crancks, Trouble his streame, and drowne all Vessells that Ride on his Greatnesse: under my mothers armes, Like to a stealing tempest will I search, And rend his root from her protection. Cra. I, now Theanor speaks like Prince Theanor. The. But how shall we provoke him to our snares? He has a temper malice cannot move To exceed the bounds of judgement; he is so wise, That we can pick no cause to affront him. Cra. No? What better then his crossing your intent? The suit I had to ye? Conons forfeit state (Before he travel'd) for a Riot, he Hath from your Mother got restor'd to him: The. Durst he? What is this Conon? Cra. One that hath, As people say, in forraigne pleasur'd him. Enter Onos, Uncle, Tutor, Neanthes, Sosicles, Eraton. But now no more; They have brought the Travellors I told you of, That's the sweet youth, that is my Brothers Rivall, That curles his head, for he has little haire, And paints his vizor, for it is no face, That so desires to follow you, my Lord: Show 'em some countenance, and it will beget Our sport at least. The. What villanous Crab-tree legs he makes? His shins are full of true-love knots. Cra. His leggs were ever villanous, since I knew him. Era. Faith his Uncle shanks are somewhat the better. Nea. But is't possible he should believe he is not of age? why He is 50. man, in's Jubile I warrant: s'light, he Looks older then a groat, the very stamp on's face is Worne out with handling. Sos. Why I tell you all men believe it when they heare him speake, He utters such single matter in so infantly a voice. Nea. He looks as like a fellow that I have seen accommodate Gentlemen with Tobacco in our Theaters. Onos. Most illustrious Prince. Era. A pox on him, he is guelt, how he trebles? Onos. I am a Gentleman a both sides. Tut. He meanes (so't please your highnesse) both by Father &amp; Mother. Sos. Thou a Gentleman? thou an Asse. Nea. He is nere the farther from being a Getl. I assure you. Tut. May it please your Grace, I am another. Nea. He is another Asse he saies, I believe him. Uncle. We be three, Heroicall Prince. Nea. Nay then we must have the Picture of 'em, and the Word Nos sumus. Tut. That have travail'd all parts of the Globe together. Unc. For my part, I have seen the vicissitude of fortune before. Onos. Peace Uncle, for though you speak a little better then I— Nea. 'Tis a very little, in truth. Onos. Yet we must both give place, as they say, to the best Speaker The Tutor. Tut. Yet since it hath pleas'd your radience to decline so low, as on us, Poore and unworthy dunghils.— Nea. What a stinking knaves this? Tut. Our Perigrination was nere so felicitated, as since we enter'd the line of your gracious favour, under whose beamy aspect, and by which infallible Mathematicall compasse, may we but hereafter presume to saile, our industries have reach't their desir'd termination and period; and we shall voluntarily sacrifice our lives to your resplendent eyes, both the Altars and fires of our devoted offrings. Onos. Oh divine Tutor! Cra. Can you hold Sir? Era. He ha's spoken this very speech to some Whore in Corinth. Nea. A plague on him for a fustian Dictionary; on my conscience this is the Ulissean Travellor that sent home his Image riding upon Elephants to the great Magoll. Sos. The same: his wit is so huge, nought but an Elephant could carry him. Era. So heavy you meane. Nea. These three, are ev'n the finest one foole tripartite, that was ere discovered. Sos. Or a Treatise of famine divided into three branches. Era. The Prince speakes. The. I thank ye for your loves; but as I told you, I have so little meanes, to do for those Few followers I have already, that I would have none shiprack themselves, and fortune, Upon my barren shelf: Sue to Euphanes. For he is Prince, and Queen, I would have no man Curse me in his old age. Cra. Alas Sir, they desire to follow you But a farre off, the farther off the better. Tut. I Sir, and't be seven mile off, so we may but follow you, onely to countenance us in the confronts and affronts, which (according to your Highnesse will) we meane on all occasions to put upon the Lord Euphanes. Onos. He shall not want gibing nor jeeriug, I warrant him; if he do, i'le forsweare wit. Nea. It has forsworne thee, 'ile sweare, it is the ancient enemy to thy house. The. Well, be it so; I here receive ye, for my followers a great way off. Nea. Seven miles, my Lord, no further. Onos. By what time, Sir, (by this measure) may I come to follow him in his Chamber? Nea. Why when his Chamber, Sir, is seven miles long. Enter Euphanes, Conon, Page, Gent. Attendants. Gent. Make way there, for my Lord Euphanes. Cro. Looke Sir, Jove appeares, The Peacock of our State, that spreads a traine Brighter then Iris blushes after raine. Euph. You need not thank me Conon, in your love You Antidated what I can do for you, And I in gratitude was bound to this, And am to much more: and what ere he be Can with unthankfulnesse assoile me, let him Dig out mine eyes, and sing my name in verse, In Ballad verse at every drinking-house, And no man be so charitable to lend me A Dogg to guide my steps. Nea. Haile to Euphanes. Sos. Mighty Euphanes. Era. The great Prince Euphanes. Tut. Key of the Court, and Jewell of the Queene. Unc. Sol in our Firmament. Onos. Pearl in the States eye. Nea. Being a black man. Era. Mistris of the Land. Nea. Our humble, humble poore Petitions are, That we may hold our places. All. May we? Euph. Yes; be you malicious knaves still: and you fooles. Con. This is the Princes, and your Brothers spight. Euph. I know't, but will not know't it. Con. Yonder they are, Who's fine childe's this? Unc. Sir. Onos. Unckle, le' be, Let him alone, he is a mighty Prince. Euph. I aske your Highnesse pardon: I protest By Jupiter I saw you not. The. Humh, it may be so, You have rais'd such mountaines 'twixt your eyes and me, That I am hidden quite: what do ye meane Sir? You much forget your selfe. Euph. I should much more, Not to remember my due duty to your Grace; I know not wherein I have so transgress'd My service to your Highnesse, to deserve This rigour and contempt, not from you only But from your followers, with the best of whom I was an equall in my lowest ebbe: Beseech you Sir, respect me as a Gentleman, I will be never more in heart to you: Five faire Discents I can derive my selfe, From Fathers worthy both in Arts and Armes. I know your goodnesse companies your greatnesse But that you are perverted: Royall Sir, I am your humblest subject, use your pleasure, But do not give protection to the wrongs Of these subordinate Slaves, whom I could crush By that great destin'd favour, which my Mistris And your majestick Mother deignes to me, But in respect of you: I know leane envie Waites ever on the steps of vertue advanc'd: But why your Mothers grace gets me disgrace, Or renders me a slave to beare these wrongs I do not know. Oh Mediocrity, Thou prizelesse jewell, only meane men have But cannot value; like the precious Jem, Found in the Mukhill by the ignorant Cock. The. Your creamy words but cozen: how durst you Intercept me so lately to my Mother? And what I meant your Brother, you obtain'd Unto the forfeiture againe. Cra. Your answer to that my Lord, my Brother. Euph. May I perish If ere I heard you intended such a Suit, Though 'twould have stuck an ignominious brand Vpon your Highnesse, to have given your servant A Gentlemans whole state of worth and quality, Confiscate only for a youthfull brawle. The. Your rudiments are too sawcy: teach your Page. Con. I, so are all things but your flatterers. Onos. Hold you your prating. Con. You know where you are, you fleeten face. Euph. Yet Sir to appease and satisfie your anger, Take what you please from me, and give it him In lieu of this: you shall not take it neither, I freely will impart it, halfe my state, Which Brother if you please— Cra. Ile starve in Chaines first, Eat my owne armes. Euph. Oh that you saw your selfe: You ne're made me such offer in my poorenesse, And 'cause (to do you ease) I sought not to you You thus maligne me; yet your nature must not Corrupt mine, nor your rude examples lead me: If mine can mend you, I shall joy; you know I feare you not: you have seene me prov'd a man In every way of fortune, 'tis my comfort I know no more such Brothers in the world As Crates is. Con. Nor I such as Euphanes: The temper of an Angell raignes in thee. Euph. Your Royall Mother Sir, (I had forgot) Entreates your presence. The. You have done her errand, I may do yours. Exit. Euph. Let it be truth my Lord. Con. Crates, ile question you for this. Cra. Pish, your worst. Exit. Con. Away you hounds after your sent. Onos. Come, we'l scorn to talk to'm: now they are gone, We'l away too. Exeunt. Con. Why beare you this my Lord? Euph. To shew the passive fortitude the best; Vertues a solid Rock, whereat being aym'd The keenest darts of envie, yet unhurt Her Marble Heroes stand, built of such Bases, Whilst they recoyle, and wound the Shooters faces. Enter Queene and Ladies. Con. My Lord, the Queene. Quee. Gentle Euphanes, how, How do'st thou honest Lord? oh how I joy To see what I have made, like a choyce Workman, That having fram'd a Master-peece, doth reape An universall comendations. Princes are Gods in this. Ile build thee yet, (The good foundation so pleases me) A story or two higher; let Doggs barke, They are fooles that hold them dignifi'd by blood, They should be only made great that are good. Euph. Oraculous Madam. Quee. Sirrah, I was thinking If I should marry thee, what merry tales Our neighbour Islands would make of us; But let that passe, you have a Mistris That would forbid our Banes: troth I have wish'd A thousand times that I had been a man, Then I might fit a day with thee alone, And talke, But as I am I must not; there's no skill In being good, but in not being thought ill. Sirrah, who's that? Euph. So't please your Majesty Conon, the friend I su'd for. Quee. 'Tis dispatch'd. Con. Gracious Madam, I owe the gods and you my life. Quee. I thanke you, I thank you heartily; and I do think you A very honest man, he sayes you are: But now ile chide thee; what's the cause my Son, For my eye's every where, and I have heard, So insolently do's thee Contume lies Past sufferance (I am told) yet you complaine not, As if my justice were so partiall As not to right the meanest: credit me, Ile call him to a strict accompt, and fright By his example, all that dare curb me In any thing that's just: I sent you for him. Euph. Humbly he did returne, he would wait on you: But let me implore your Majesty, not to give His Highnesse any check, for worthlesse me; They are Court canckers, and not Counsellors That thus informe you: they do but hate the Prince, And would subvert me: I should curse my fortune Even at the highest, to be made the ginne To unscrew a Mothers love unto her Son: Better had my pale flame in humble shades Been spent unseene, then to be rais'd thus high, Now to be thought a meteor to the State, Portending ruine and contagion: Beseech you then rest satisfi'd, the Prince Is a most noble natur'd Gentleman, And never did to me but what I tooke As favours from him, my blown billowes must not Strive 'gainst my shore, that should confine me; nor Justle with Rocks to break themselves to peeces. Quee. Well, thou'rt the composition of a god: My Lion, Lamb, my Eaglet, and my Dove, Whose soule runs clearer then Dianas Fount, Nature pick'd severall flowers from her choyce banks And bound 'em up in thee, sending thee forth A Posie for the bosome of a Queene. Lady. The Prince attends you. Quee. Farewell my good Lord, My honest man; Stay, hast no other suit? I prethee tell me; Sirrah, thine eye speakes As if thou hadst: out with it modest foole. Euph. With favour Madam, I would crave your leave To Marry, where I am bound in gratitude, The immediat meanes she was to all my being: Nor do I think your wisedome sacred Queen Fetters in favours, taking from me so The liberty that meanest men enjoy. Quee. To marry? you are a foole: thou'st anger'd me: Leave me, ile think on't: Exit Euph. and Conon. Only to try thee this, for though I love thee, Enter Theanor. I can subdue my selfe: but she that can Enjoy thee, doth enjoy more then a man. Nay rise without a blessing, or kneele still: What's Sir the reason you oppose me thus, And seeke to darken what I would have shine? Ecclipse a fire much brighter then thy selfe, Making your Mother not a competent Judge Of her owne actions? The. Gracious Madam, I I have done no more then what in royalty (And to preserve your fame) was fit to do: Heard you the peoples talke of you, and him You favour so, his greatnesse, and your love, The pitty given to me, you would excuse me, They prate as if he did dishonour you: And what know I, but his owne lavish tongue Has utter'd some such speeches; he is call'd The King of Corinth. Quee. They are traitors all: I weare a Christall casement 'fore my heart, Through which each honest eye may looke in to't: Let it be prospect unto all the world, I care not this. The. This must not be my way; Your pardon gracious Madam: these incitements Made me not shew so cleare a countenance Upon the Lord Euphanes as I would: Which since your Majesty affects so grievously Ile cleare the black cloud of it, and henceforth Uow on this knee all love and grace to him. Quee. Rise with my blessing, and to prove this true, Beare him from me this Cabinet of Jewells In your owne person, tell him, for his marrying He may dispose him how, and when he please. Exit Quee. The. I shall discharge my duty and your will. Crates? Enter Crates. Cro. I have heard all my Lord, how luckely Fate pops her very spindle in our hands: This marriage with Beliza you shall crosse, Then have I one attempt for Lamprias more Upon this Phaeton: where's Merione's Ring, That in the Rape you tooke from her? The. 'Tis here. Cra. In and effect our purpose: you my Lord Shall disobey your Mothers charge, and fend This Cabinet by some servant of her owne, That what succeeds may have no reference Unto your Highnesse. The. On, my engine on. Cra. Now, if we be not struck by Heavens owne hand, We'l ruine him, and on his ruines stand. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Agenor, Leonidas, Merione, Beliza. A sad Song. Ag. These heavie Ayres feed sorrow in her Lady, And nourish it too strongly; like a Mother That spoiles her Childe with giving on't the will. Bel. Some lighter note. A lighter Song. Leo. How like a hill of Snow she sits, and melts Before the unchast fire of others lust? What heart can see her passion and not break? Ag. Take comfort gentle Madam; you know well Even actuall sins committed without will, Are neither sins nor shame, much more compell'd; Your Honour's no whit lesse, your Chastity No whit impair'd, for faire Merione Is more a Virgin yet then all her Sex: Alas, 'tis done; why burne these Tapers now? Wicked and frantick Creatures joy in night. Leo. Imagine faire Merione had dream'd She had been ravish'd, would she sit thus then Excruciate? Mer. Oh. Bel. Fye, fye, how fond is this? What reason for this surfet of remorse? How many that have done ill, and proceed, Women that take degrees in wantonnesse, Commence, and rise in rudiments of Lust, That feele no scruple of this tendernesse? Mer. Pish. Bel. Nor are you matches in mishap, even I Doe beare an equall part of misery; That love, belov'd, a man, the Crowne of men, Whom I have friended, and how rais'd 'tis better That all doe know and speak it then my selfe: When he sail'd low I might have made him mine, Now at his full gale, it is questionable If ever I o're-take him. Ag. Wherefore sits My Phebe shadowed in a sable cloud? Those pearly drops which thou lets't fall like beades, Numbring on them thy vestall Orisons Alas are spent in vaine: I love thee still, In mid'st of all these showres thou sweetlier sent'st, Like a green Meadow on an April day, In which the Sun and West-wind play together, Striving to catch and drink the balmy drops. Enter Euphanes and Servant. Ser. The Lord Euphanes Madam. Exit Mer. Ag. Poore Merione, She loathes the light, and men. Exit. Euph. The vertuous gods preserve my Mistris. Bel. O my most honour'd Lord, those times are chang'd. Euph. Let times and men change, could Heaven change, Euphanes Should never change, to be devoted ever To faire Beliza, should my load of honours, Or any Grace which you were Author of Detract mine honour, and diminish Grace? The gods forbid: you here behold your Servant, Your Creature, gentle Lady, whose sound sleepes You purchas'd for him: whose food you paid for, Whose garments were your charge, whose first preferment You founded: then, what since the gracious Queene Hath, or can reare, is upon your free Land, And you are Mistris of. Bel. Mock me not gentle Lord, You shine now in too high a spheare for me, We are Plannets now disjoyn'd for ever: yet Poore superstitious innocent that I am, Give leave that I may lift my hands, and love Not in Idolatry, but perfect zeale: For credit me, I repent nothing I have done, But were it to begin would do the same. Euph. There are two Seas in Corinth, and two Queens, And but there, not two such in the spacious Universe; I came to tender you the man you have made, And like a thankfull streame to retribute All you my Ocean have enrich'd me with. You told me once you'ld marry me. Bel. Another mock? you were wont to play faire play, You scorne poore helps; he that is sure to win, May slight mean harts, whose hand commands the Queen Euph. Let me be held the Knave through all the Stock When I doe slight my Mistris; you know well The gracious inclination of the Queene, Who sent me leave this morning to proceed To marry, as I saw convenience, And a great gift of Jewels: Three daies hence The generall sacrifice is done to Vesta, And can you by then be accommodated Your servant shall wait on you to the Temple. Bel. Till now I never felt a reall joy indeed. Euph. Here then I seale my duty, here my love, Till which vouchsafe to weare this Ring, deare Mistris; Twas the Queens Token, and shall celebrate Our Nuptialls. Bel. Honour still raise, and preserve My honour'd Lord, as he preserves all honour. Exit Euph. Enter Agenor, Leonidas, Merione. Ag. Why shift you places thus Merione, And will not lend a word? Could'st thou so soone Leave sorrow as the place, how blest were I, But 'twill not be; griefe is an impudent guest, A follower every where, a hanger on, That words nor blowes can drive away. Leo. Deare Sister. Bel. Who can be sad? out with these Tragick Lights, And let day repossesse her naturall howres: Teare downe these blacks, cast ope' the Casements wide, That we may jocondly behold the Sun. I did partake with sad Merione In all her mourning: let her now rejoyce With glad Beliza, for Euphanes is As full of love, full of humility As when he wanted. Mer. Oh—that. Leo. Help, she faints: Her griefe has broke her heart. Mer. No—that—that. Ag. Mistris, what point you at? Her lamps are out, yet still she extends her hand As if she saw something antipathous Unto her vertuous life. Leo. Still, still she points, And her lips move, but no articulate sound Breathes from 'em: Sister, speak, what moves you thus? Bel. Her spirits returne. Mer. Oh, hide that fatall Ring, Where had it you Beliza? Bel. What hid fate Depends on it? Euphanes gave it me As holy pledge of future Marriage. Mer. Then is Euphanes the foule Ravisher? Let me speake this and dye. That dismall night Which seal'd my shame upon me, was that Ring, The partner of my rob'd virginity. Leo. Euphanes? Ag. Strange. Bel. Impossible. Mer. Impossible to have redresse on him, Chiefe servant to the Queene—ha! I have read Somewhere I am sure, of such an injury Done to a Lady: and how she durst dye. Exit. Ag. Oh follow her Beliza Bel. To assure her, The unlikelihood of this Ag. Love hides all sins. Exit. What's to be done Leonidas? Leo. Why this: Amazement takes up all my faculties; The plagues of gods and men will muster all To avenge this tyranny. Oh frontlesse man, To dare doe ill, and hope to beare it thus: First let's implore, then cure. Ag. Who, who can trust The gentle lookes and words of two-fac'd man? Like Corinths double torrent, you and I Will rush upon the Land; nor shall the Queene Defend this Villaine in his villany: Lusts violent flames can never be withstood Nor quench'd, but with as violent streames of blood.

Well, hum— Have I for this thou faire but falsest faire Stretch'd this same simple legge over the Sea? What though my bashfulnesse, and tender yeares, Durst ne're reveale my affection to thy teeth? Deep love ne're tatles, and (say they) loves bit The deeper dip'd, the sweeter still is it. Tut. Oh, see the power of Love: he speakes in ryme. Cra. Oh, love will make a Dog howle in rime: Of all the Lovers yet I have heard or read This is the strangest: but his Guardian, And you his Tutor should informe him better, Thinkes he, that Love is answer'd by instinct? Tut. He should make meanes, For certaine Sir his bashfulnesse undo's him, For from his Cradle h'had a shamefull face. Thus walkes he night and day, eates not a bit, Nor sleepes one jot, but's growne so humorous; Drinkes Ale, and takes Tobacco as you see; Weare's a Steeleto at his Codpeece close, Stabs on the least occasion: stroakes his beard, Which now he puts i'th posture of a T. The Roman T. your T. beard is the fashion, And twifold doth expresse the enamour'd Courtier, As full as your fork-carving Travellour. On. Oh, black clouds of discontent invellop me, Garters fly off: go Hatband, binde the browes Of some dull Citizen that feares to ake: And Leg appeare now in simplicity Without the trappings of a Courtier: Burst Buttons, burst, your Bachelor is worm'd. Cra. A worm-eaten Batchelor th'art indeed. On. And Devill melancholly possesses me now. Unc. Crosse him not in this fit I advise you Sir. On. Dye crimson Rose, that didst adorne these cheeks, For ytch of love is now broke forth on me. Unc. Poore Boy, 'tis true: his wrists and hands are scabby. On. Burne eyes out in your sockets, sinck and stink: Teeth I will pick ye to the very bones, Hang haire like Hemp, or like the Isling Curs, For never Powder, nor the Crisping-iron Shall touch these dangling locks—oh—Ruby lips, Love hath to you been like Wine-vinegar, Now you look wan and pale, lips, ghosts ye are, And my disgrace sharper than Mustard-seed. Cra. How like a Chaundler he do's vent his passions, Risum teneatis? On. Well sung the Poet, Love is a golden bubo, full of Dreames: That ripen'd breakes, and fills us with extreames. Tut. A gold buble, pupill, Oh grosse solæcisme To chaster eares, that understand the Latine. On. I will not be corrected now: I am in love, revenge is now the Cud That I do chaw: Ile challenge him. Cra. I marry Sir. Unc. Your Honour bids you Nephew, on, and prosper. On. But none will beare it from me, times are dangerous. Cra. Carry it your selfe man. On. Tutor, your counsell: Ile do nothing Sir Without him. Unc. This may rid thee, (valiant Cuz) Whom I have kept this forty yeare my Ward: Faine would I have his state, and now of late He did enquire at Ephesus for his age, But the Church Booke being burnt with Dians Temple He lost his ayme: I have try'd to famish him, Marry he'l live o' stones: and then for Poysons, He is an Antidote 'gainst all of 'em; He sprung from Mithridates; he is so dry and hot, He will eat Spiders faster then a Monkey: His Maw (unhurt) keeps Quicksilver like a bladder, The largest dosse of Camphire, Opium, Harmes not his braine; I think his Skul's as empty As a suckt Egge; Vitrioll, and Oyle of Tartar He will eat tosts of: Henbane I am sure And Hemblock I have made his Pot-hearbs often. Cra. If he refuse you, yours is then the honour: If he accept, he being so great, you may Crave both to chuse the Weapon, time, and place, Which may be ten yeares hence, and Calicut, Or underneath the lyne to avoid advantage. On. I am resolved. Tut. By your favour Pupill, Whence shall this challenge rise? for you must ground it On some such fundamentall base, or matter As now the Gentry set their lives upon. Did you ere cheat him at some Ordinary, And durst he say so, and be angry? if thus, Then you must challenge him: hath he call'd your whore, Whore; though she be (beside yours) twenty mens? Your honour, reputation is touch'd then, And you must challenge him: Has he deny'd On thirty damne me's to accommodate money, Though he have broke threescore before to you? Here you must challenge him: Durst he ever shun To drink two pots of Ale wi' ye? or to wench, Though weighty businesse otherwise importun'd? He is a proud Lord, And you may challenge him: Has he familiarly Dislik'd your yellow Starch, or said your Dublet Was not exactly frenchifi'd? or that, that report In faire tearmes was untrue? or drawn your Sword, Cry'd 'twas ill mounted? Has he given the lye In circle, or oblique, or semy-circle, Or direct paralell? you must challenge him. On. He never gave my direct apparrell the lye in's life. Tut. But for the crown of all, Has he refus'd To pledge your Mistris health though he were sick? Enter Neanthes and Page. And crav'd your pardon? you must challenge him, There's no avoyding: one or both must drop. On. Exquisite Tutor. Nean. Crates, I have sought you long, what make you here Fooling with these three farthings, while the Towne Is all in uproare, and the Prince our Master (Ceas'd by Leonidas, and Agenor) carried And Prisoner kept i'the Castle, flanckes The west part of the City, where they vow To hold him, till your Brother, Lord Euphanes Be rendr'd to 'em, with his life to satisfie The Rape, by him suspected to Merione? The Queene refuses to deliver him, Pawning her knowledge for his innocency, And dares 'em do their worst on Prince Theanor, The whole State's in combustion. Cra. Fatall Ring. Unc. What will become of us? Nea. And she hath given Commission to Euphanes And Conon (who have leavied men already) With violence to surprize the Towre, and take 'em. What will you doe? Cra. Along wi' ye, and prevent A further mischiefe: Gentlemen, our intents We must defer: you are the Princes followers. Nea. Will ye walk with us? Unc. You shall pardon us. Tut. We are his followers afarre off you know. And are contented to continue so. Exit Crates and Neant. Onos. Sir Boy. Page. Sir Foole? a Challenge to my Lord? How dar'st thou, or thy ambs??ace here think of him, Ye Crow-pick'd heads, which your thin shoulders beare As doe the poles on Corinth Bridge the Traitors: Why you three Ninc-pins, you talke of my Lord, And Challenges? you shall not need: come draw, His Page is able to swindge three such whelpes: Unckle, why stand ye off: long-man advance. Onos. S'light, what have we done Tutor? Tut. He is a Boy, And we may run away with honour. Page. That ye shall not, And being a Boy I am fitter to encounter A Childe in Law as you are, under twenty: Thou Sot, thou three-score Sot, and that's a Childe Againe I grant you. Unc. Nephew, here's an age: Boyes are turn'd men, and men are Children. Page. Away you Pezants with your bought Gentry; Are not you he, when your fellow Passengers, Your last transportment being assayl'd by a Galley Hid your selfe i'the Cabbin: and the Fight done Peep'd above Hatches, and cry'd, Have we taken, Or are we tane? Come, I doe want a slipper, But this shall serve: Sweare all as I would have you, Or I will call some dozen brother Pages, (They are not farre off I am sure) and we will blancket You untill you pisse againe. All. Nay, we will sweare Sir. Page. 'Tis your best course: First, you shall sweare never to name my Lord, Or heare him nam'd hereafter, but bare-headed. Next, to begin his health in every place, And never to refuse to pledge it, though You surfeit to the death. Lastly, to hold The poorest, litlest Page in reverence; To think him valianter, and a better Gentleman Then you three stamp'd together: and to give him Wine and Tobacco wheresoe're you meet, And the best meat if he can stay. All. We sweare it loyally. Page. Then I dismisse you True Leigmen to the Pantaffle: I had more Articles, but I have businesse And cannot stay now: so adieu deare Monsieur, Tres nobles &amp; tres puissant. Unc. Adieu Monsieur. On. A vostre service &amp; commaundement. Tut. I told you Pupill, you'ld repent this foolery. On. Who, I repent? you are mistaken Tutor, I ne're repented any thing yet in my life, And scorne to begin now: Come, let's be melancholly. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Queene, Euphanes, Conon, Lords. Lord. 'Twere better treat with 'em. Quee. I will no Treaties With a League-breaker and a Rebell; shall I Article with a Traitor? be compell'd To yeeld an innocent unto their fury Whom I have prov'd so to you? Euph. Gracious Queene, Though your owne god-like disposition Would succour vertue, and protect the right, Yet for the publike good, for the deare safety Of your most Royall onely Son, consent To give me up the sacrifice to their malice: My life is aym'd at, and 'twere better farre The blood of twenty thousand such as I Purpled our Seas, then that your Princely Son Should be endanger'd. Quee. Still well said honest Foole, Were their demand but one haire from thy head, By all the gods il'd scorne 'em: were they here, The Majesty that dwels upon this brow Should strike 'em on their knees: As for my Son, Let 'em no more dare then they'l answer, I An equall Mother to my Country, am, And every vertuous Son of it is son Unto my bosome, tender as mine owne. Con. Oh, you are heavenly Madam, and the gods Can suffer nothing passe to injure you: The life that Conon promis'd, he stands now Ready to pay with joy. Quee. Farewell both, Successe attend you: you have Souldiers been, Tam Marte quam Mercurio: if you bring not peace Bring me their heads. Con. I will put faire for one. Exit Quee. Lords. Euph. Double the Guard upon her Highnesse Person; Conon, you must performe a friendly part, Which I shall counsell you. Con. I am your Servant Exeunt. Scæna Tertia. Enter Theanor, Agenor, Leonidas above. Leo. Make good that Fortification, and the Watch Keepe still upon the Battlements: Royall Sir, Weigh but our injuries, we have told you fully The manner and the matter hales us thus; Nor shall this upstart Mushrum bred i'th night, Sit brooding underneath your Mothers wings His damn'd impieties. Ag. For your selfe, brave Prince, Feare nothing that this face of Armes presents: We aske the Ravisher, and have no meanes To win him from your most indulgent Mother But by this practice. The. Stout Leonidas, Princely Agenor, your wrongs cry so loud, That who so would condemne you is not heard: I blame you not, who but Euphanes durst Make Stories like to this? My wrong's as strong Aske my revengefull arme to strengthen yours: As for my feare, know you, and Greece throughout, Enter Euphanes and Conon. Our Mother was a Spartan Princesse borne, That never taught me to spell such a word. Con. Sir, you doe tempt your life. Euph. Conon, no more. Doe thus as thou wouldst save it. Sound Trumpet within. Ag. What Trumpet's this? Leo. Beneath I doe perceive Two armed men, single, that give us summons As they would treat. Ag. Let us descend. Con. My Lord, I would you would excuse me, and proceed According to the Queenes directions. Euph. Friend, As thou wouldst weare that title after death Enter below Theanor, Agenor, Leonidas and Souldiers. Performe my charge: no Souldier on his life Approach us nearer. Con. Safety to both the Princes, loyalty To you Lord Generall, the Queene, your Mistris As well as ours, though not to feare, to cut Civill dissention from her Land, and save Much guiltlesse blood, that uprore ever thirsts, And for the safe-guard of her Son, by me (As you demand) hath sent the Lord Euphanes To plead his owne cause, or to suffer death As you shall finde him worthy; so delivering The Prince back, I shall leave him to your Guard. Leo. The Queene is good and gracious: kisse her hand. Ag. And seale our duties: Sir, depart in peace. The. Oh Sir, you now perceive, when in the scales Nature, and fond affection weigh together, One poyzes like a feather, and you know my Lords What's to be done. Euph. Your Highnesse is unarm'd, Please you to use mine, and to lead the Army Back to your Mother: Conon, march you with 'em. Con. I will my Lord: But not so farre as not To bring you help if danger looke upon you. Exit. Euph. Why doe you looke so strangely, fearefully, Or stay your deathfull hande, be not so wise To stop your rage: looke how unmoov'dly, here I give my selfe my Countries sacrifice, An innocent sacrifice: Truth laughs at death, And terrifies the killer more then kill'd; Integrity thus armelesse seekes her foes, And never needs the Target, nor the Sword, Bow, nor invenom'd shafts. Leo. We are amaz'd, Not at your eloquence, but impudence, That dare thus front us. Ag. Kill him, who knowes not The iron forehead that bold mischiefe weares. Leo. Forbeare a while Agenor, I doe tremble, And something sits like vertue in his face, Which the gods keep. Euph. Agenor, strike Leonidas You that have purchas'd fame on certaine grounds, Loose it on supposition? smeare your hands In guiltlesse blood, laugh at my Martyrdome: But yet remember, when Posterity Shall read your Volumes fill'd with vertuous acts, And shall arrive at this black bloody leafe, Noting your foolish barbarisme, and my wrong, (As time shall make it plaine) what followes this Disciphering any noble deed of yours Shall be quite lost, for men will read no more. Leo. Why? dare you say you are innocent? Euph. By all the gods, as they Of this foule crime, why Gent. pry clean through my life, Then weigh these circumstances: think you that he Which made day night, and men to furies turn'd, Durst not trust silence, vizors, nor her sence That suffer'd; but with Charmes and Potions Cast her asleep, (for all this I have enquir'd) Acted the Fable of Proserpines-Rape, The place (by all description) like to Hell: And all to perpetrate unknowne his Lust, Would fondly in his Person bring a Ring, And give it a betrothed Wife, ith' same house Where the poore injur'd Lady liv'd, and groan'd. Ag. Hell gives us Art to reach the depth of sin, But leaves us wretched Fooles, when we are in. Euph. Had it given me that Art, and left me so, I would not thus into the Lyons jawes Have thrust my selfe (defencelesse) for your good, The Princes safety, or the Common-weales: You know the Queene deny'd me, and sent us Commanders to surprize you, and to race This Tower down, we had power enough to doe it, Or starve you, as you saw, and not to tender My Person to your wrath, which I have done, Knowing my heart as pure as infants sleep. Leo. What think you Sir? Ag. No harme I am sure: I weepe. Euph. The gods are just, and mighty: but to give you Further assurance, and to make your selves Judges, and witnesses of my innocency, Let me demand this question: On what night Was this foule deed committed? Ag. On the Eave Before our Marriage meant. Euph. Leonidas, (Your rage being off, that still drownes memory) Where was your selfe and I that very night, And what our conference? Leo. By the gods 'tis true: Both in her Highnesse Chamber conferring Even of this Match untill an houre of day, And then came I to call you: we are sham'd. Ag. Vtterly lost, and sham'd. Euph. Neither, be chear'd, He that could finde this out can pardon it, And know this Ring was sent me from the Queene, How she came by it, yet is not exquir'd, Deeper occurrents hang on't: and pray Heaven That my suspicions prove as false as yours, Which (for the world) till I have greater proofe I dare not utter what, nor whom they touch; Only this build upon, with ail my nerves Ile labour with ye, till time waken truth. Ag. There are our swords Sir, turne the points on us, Leo. Punish Rebellion, and revenge your wrong. Euph. Sir, my revenge shall be to make your peace, Neither was this Rebellion, but rash love. Enter Conon. Con. How's this? unarm'd left, now found doubly arm'd? And those that would have slaine him at his feet? Oh Truth, thou art a mighty Conqueresse: The Queene (my Lord) perplex'd in care of you, That crosse to her command hazard your selfe In person, here is come into the Field, And like a Leader, marches in the head Of all her Troopes, vowes that she will demolish Each stone of this proud Tower be you not safe: She chafes like stormes in Groves, now sighs, now weepes, And both sometimes, like Raine and Wind commixt, Abjures her Son for ever, lesse himselfe Do fetch you off in person, that did give Your selfe to save him of your owne free will, And sweares he must not, nor is fit to live. Euph. Oh she's a Mistris for the gods. Ag. And thou A godlike servant fit for her. Leo. Wide Greece May boast because she cannot boast thy like. Euph. Thus Conon tell her Highnesse. Con. My joy flyes. Euph. Let's toward her march: sterne Drum speake gentle peace. Leo. We are prisoners, lead us, ne're was knowne A president like this: one unarm'd man (Suspected) to captive with golden words (Truth being his sheild) so many arm'd with swords. Ex. Enter (at one Doore) Queen, Theanor, Crates, Conon, Lords, Souldiers, (at another) Euphanes (with two swords) Agenor, Leonidas, Souldiers: Euphanes presents Leonidas on his knees to the Queen: Agenor bare-headed makes shew of sorrow to the Queen, she stamps and seemes to be angry at first, Euphanes perswades her, layes their swords at her feet, she kisses him, gives them their swords againe, they kisse her hand and embrace, the Souldiers lift up Euphanes, and shout: Theanor and Crates discovered, Conon whispers with Crates, Euphanes with Agenor, and Leonidas observes it, who seeme to promise something, Euphanes directs his Page somewhat. Exeunt all but Theanor and Crates. The. We are not lucky Crates, this great torrent Beares all before him. Cra. Such an age as this Shall ne're be seene againe: vertue growes fat, And villany pines; the Furies are asleep, Mischiefe 'gainst goodnesse aym'd is like a stone, Unnaturally forc'd up an imminent hill, Whose weight falls on our heads and buries us, We springe our selves, we sink in our owne bogs. The. What's to be done? Cra. Repent and grow good. The. Pish, 'Tis not the fashion (foole) till we grow old: The peoples love to him now scares me more Then my fond Mothers: both which like two floods Bearing Euphanes up; will o're-flow me, And he is worthy, would he were in Heaven, Be that hereafter: Crates helpe me now, And henceforth be at ease. Cra. Your will my Lord? The. Beliza is to marry him forth-with, I long to have the first touch of her too, That will a little quiet me. Cra. Fie Sir, You'l be the tyrant to virginity; To fall but once is manly, to persevere Beastly, and desperate. The. Crosse me not but do't: Are not the meanes, the place, the instruments The very same? I must expect you suddenly. Exit. Cra. I must obey you. Who is in evill once a companion Can hardly shake him off, but must run on. Here I appointed Conon to attend Him, and his sword: he promis'd to come single Enter Conon and Page. To avoyd prevention: he is a man on's word. Con. You are well met Crates. Cra. If we part so Conon. Con. Come, we must doe these mutuall offices, We must be our owne seconds, our owne Surgeons, And fairely fight, like men, not on advantage. Caa. You have an honest bosome. Con. Yours seemes so. Cra. Let's paire our swords: you are a just Gentleman. Con. You might be so: now shake hands if you please, Though't be the cudgell fashion, 'tis a friendly one. Cra. So, stand off. Page. That's my que to beckon 'em. Exit. Con. Crates, to expostulate your wrongs to me Were to doubt of 'em, or wish your excuse In words, and so returne like maiden Knights: Yet freely thus much I professe, your spleene And rugged carriage toward your honour'd Brother Hath much more stirr'd me up, then mine owne cause, For I did ne're affect these bloody men, But hold 'em fitter be made publike Hangmen, Or Butchers call'd, then valiant Gentlemen: 'Tis true stamp'd valour do's upon just grounds, Yet for whom justlier should I expose my life Than him, unto whose vertue I owe all. Cra. Conon, you think by this great deed of yours To insinuate your selfe a lodging nearer Unto my Brothers heart: such men as you Live on their undertakings for their Lords, And more disable them by answering for 'em Then if they sate still, make 'em but their Whores, For which end Gallants now adayes do fight: But here we come not to upbraid; what men Seeme, the rash world will judge; but what they are Heaven knowes: and this—Horses, we are discry'd, One stroak for feare of laughter. Enter Euphanes, Agenor, Leonidas, Page. Con. Halfe a score. Euph. Hold, hold: on your allegeance hold. Ag. He that strikks next— Leo. Falls like a Traytor on our swords. Euph. Oh Heaven, my Brother bleeds: Conon, thou art A villaine, an unthankfull man, and shalt Pay me thy blood for his, for his is mine: Thou wert my friend, but he is still my Brother; And though a friennd sometimes be nearer said In some gradation, it can never be Where that same Brother can be made a friend, Which dearest Crates thus low I implore; What in my poverty I would not seeke, Because I would not burthen you, now here In all my height of blisse I beg of you, Your friendship; my advancement Sir is yours; I never held it strange, pray use it so: We are but two, which number Nature fram'd In the most usefull faculties of man, To strengthen mutually and releeve each other: Two eyes, two eares, two armes, two leggs and feet, That where one fail'd the other might supply; And I, your other eye, eare, your arme and legge, Tender my service, helpe and succour to ye. Ag., Leo. A most divine example. Euph. For deare Brother, You have been blind, and lame, and deafe to me, Now be no more so: in humility I give ye the duty of a younger Brother, Which take you as a Brother, not a Father, And then you'l pay a duty back to me. Cra. Till now I have not wept these thirty yeares. Euph. Discording Brothers are like mutuall leggs Supplanting one another: he that seekes Aid from a stranger and forsakes his Brother, Do's but like him that madly lops his arme, And to his body joynes a wooden one: Cuts off his naturall legge, and trusts a Crutch, Plucks out his eye to see with Spectacles. Cra. Most deare Euphanes, in this crimson floud Wash my unkindnesse out: you have ore-come me, Taught me humanity and brotherhood; Full well knew Nature thou wert fitter far To be a Ruler ore me then a Brother, Which henceforth be: Jove surely did descend When thou wert gotten in some heavenly shape And greet my Mother, as the Poets tell Of other women. Ag. Be this Holy-day. Leo. And noted ever with the whitest stone. Con. And pardon me my Lord, looke you, I bleed Faster then Crates; what I have done I did To reconcile your loves, to both a friend, With my blood ciment, never to part or end. Ag. Most worthy Conon. Leo. Happy rise, this day Contracts more good then a whole age hath done. Euph. Royall Agenor, brave Leonidas, You are maine causes, and must share the fame. Cra. Which in some part this hower shall requight, For I have aym'd my black shafts at white markes, And now ile put the clew into your hands Shall guide ye most perspicuously to the depth Of this dark Laborinth, where so long ye were lost Touching this old Rape, and a new intent, Wherein your counsell, and your active wit My dearest Brother will be necessary. Euph. My Prophecy is come, prove my hopes true Agenor shall have right, and you no wrong, Time now will pluck her daughter from her Cave: Let's hence to prevent rumour; my deare Brother, Natures divided streames the highest shelfe Will over-run at last, and flow to it selfe. Exeunt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Scæna Prima. Enter Crates, Euphanes, Neanthes, Sosicles, Eraton. Euph. I have won the Lady to it, and that good Which is intended to her, your faith onely And secrecie must make perfect: Thinke not Sir, I speake as doubting it, for I dare hazard My soule upon the tryall. Cra. You may safely, But are Agenor, and Leonidas ready To rush upon him in the Act, and seize him In the height of his security? Euph. At all parts As you could wish them. Cra. Where's the Lady? Euph. There Where you appointed her to stay. Cra. 'Tis wisely order'd. Euph. Last, when you have him sure compell him this way, For as by accident here ile bring the Queene To meet you, 'twill strike greater terrour to him, To be tane unprovided of excuse, And make more for our purposes. Exit. Cra. Come Neanthes, Our fames and all are at the stake. Nea. 'Tis fit That since relying on your skill we venture So much upon one game, you play with cunning Enter Theanor. Or we shall rise such losers: as— Sos. The Prince. Cra. The plot is laid Sir, howsoe're I seem'd A little scrupulous, upon better judgement I have effected it. The. 'Tis the last service Of this foule kinde I will employ you in. Cra. We hope so Sir. The. And I will so reward it— Nea. You are bound to that; in every Family That do's write lustfull, your fine Bawd gaines more (For like your Broker, he takes fees on both sides) Then all the Officers of the house. Sos. For us then To be a great mans Panders, and live poore, That were a double fault. Cra. Come, you lose time Sir, We will be with you instantly: the deed done, We have a Mask that you expect not. The. Thou art ever carefull: for Joves Mercury I would not change thee. Exit. Era. There's an honour for you. Nea. To be compar'd with the celestiall Pimp, Joves smock-sworne Squire, Dan Hermes. Cra, Ile deserve it, And Gentlemen be assur'd, though what we do now Will to the Prince Theanor looke like treason And base disloyalty, yet the end shall prove, When he's first taught to know himselfe, then you, In what he judg'd us false we were must true. Exeunt. Scæna Secunda. Enter Euphanes, Agenor, Leonidas, Conon. Euph. Only make haste (my Lords) in all things else You are instructed: you may draw your swords For shew if you thinke good, but on my life You will finde no resistance in his servants, And he's himselfe unarm'd. Ag. I would he were not, My just rage should not then be lost. Euph. Good Sir, Have you a care no injury be done Unto the Person of the Prince: but Conon, Have you an eye on both, it is your trust That I relye on. Con. Which I will discharge, Assure your selfe most faithfully. Euph. For the Lady, I know your best respect will nor be wanting: Then to avoyd suspition and discovery, I hold it requisite, that as soone as ever The Queene hath seene her, she forsake the place, And fit her selfe for that which is projected For her good, and your honour. Leo. If this prosper, Beleeve it you have made a purchase of My service and my life. Euph. Your love I ayme at. Leo. Here I shall finde you? Euph. With the Queene. Con. Enough Sir. Exit. Enter Page.

I knew I should be sought for, as I wish'd She's come her selfe in person. Quee. Are you found Sir? I wonder where you spend your houres, me thinkes Since I so love your company, and professe 'Tis the best comfort this life yeelds me; mine Should not be tedious to you. Euph. Gracious Madam, To have the happinesse to see and heare you, Which by your bounty is conferr'd upon me, I hold so great a blessing, that my honours And wealth compar'd to that are but as Cyphers To make that number greater: yet your pardon For borrowing from my duty so much time As the provision for my sudden Marriage Exacted from me. Quee. I perceive this Marriage Will keepe you often from me: but ile beare it. She's a good Lady, and a faire, Euphanes, Yet by her leave I will share with her in you: I am pleas'd that in the night she shall enjoy you, And that's sufficient for a Wife: the day time I will divorce you from her.

Enter Agenor, Leonidas with Theanor, Merione like Beliza, Conon, Crates, Neanthes, Sosicles, Eraton, Guard. Quee. What ere it be ile meet it, I was not borne to feare: Who's that Beliza? Euph. My worthiest, noblest Mistris. Exit. Quee. Stay her, ha? All of you looke as you were rooted here, And wanted motion: what new Gorgons head Have you beheld, that you are all turn'd Statues? This is prodigious: ha's none a tongue To speake the cause? Leo. Could every haire great Queene Upon my head yeeld an articulate sound, And all together speake, they could not yet Expresse the villany we have discover'd, And yet, when with a few unwilling words I have deliver'd what must needs be knowne, You'l say I am too eloquent, and wish I had been borne without a tongue. Quee. Speak boldly, For I unmov'd with any losse will heare. Leo. Then know, we have found out the Ravisher Of my poore Sister, and the place, and meanes By which th'unfortunate though faire Beliza Hath met a second violence. Euph. This confirmes What but before I doubted, to my ruine My Lady ravish'd. Quee. Point me out the villaine, That guilty wretched monster that hath done this, That I may looke on him, and in mine eye He read his Sentence. Leo. That I truly could Name any other but the Prince, that heard You have it all. Queen. Wonder not that I shake, The miracle is greater that I live, Having endur'd the thunder that thy words Have throwne upon me: dar'st thou kneele, with hope Of any favour, but a speedy death, And that too in the dreadfull'st shape that can Appeare to a dispairing leaprous soule, If thou hast any? no, libidinous beast, Thy Lust hath alter'd so thy former being, By Heaven I know thee not. The. Although unworthy Yet still I am your Son. Quee. Thou lyest, lyest falsly, My whole life never knew but one chaste bed, Nor e're desir'd warmth but from lawful fires, Can I be then the Mother to a Goat, Whose lust is more insatiate then the grave, And like infectious ayre engenders plagues, To murder all that's chaste, or good in woman? The gods I from my youth have serv'd and fear'd, Whose holy Temples thou hast made thy Brothells; Could a Religious Mother then bring forth So damn'd an Atheist? read but o're my life, My actions, manners, and made perfect in them But looke into the story of thy selfe As thou art now, not as thou wert Theanor, And Reason will compell thee to confesse, Thou art a stranger to me. Ag. Note but how heavie The weight of guilt is: it so low hath sunke him That he wants power to rise up in defence Of his bad cause. Quee. Perswade me not Euphanes, This is no Prince, nor can claime part in me: My Son was borne a Free-man, this a Slave To beastly passions, a Fugitive, And run-away from vertue: bring bonds for him. By all the honour that I owe to Justice He loses me for ever that seekes to save him: Binde him I say, and like a wretch that knowes He stands condemn'd before he heares the Sentence, With his base Agents, from my sight remove him, And lodge them in the Dungeon: As a Queene And Patronesse to Justice I command it: Thy teares are like unseasonable showres, And in my heart now steel'd can make no entrance: Thou art cruell to thy selfe (Foole) 'tis not want In me of soft compassion; when thou left'st To be a Son, I ceas'd to be a Mother; Away with them: The children I will leave To keepe my name to all posterities Shall be the great examples of my Justice, The government of my Country, which shall witnesse How well I rul'd my selfe: bid the wrong'd Ladies Appeare in Court to morrow, we will heare them; And by one Act of our severity For feare of punishment, or love to vertue, Teach others to be honest: all will shun To tempt her Lawes, that would not spare her Son. Exe. Scæna Tertia. Enter Onos, Unckle, and Tutor. Unc. Nay Nephew. Tut. Pupill, heare but reason. On. No, I have none, and will heare none; oh my honor, My honour blasted in the bud, my youth, My hopefull youth, and all my expectation Ever to be a man are lost for ever. Unc. Why Nephew, we as well as you are dub'd Knights of the Pantofle. Tut. And are shouted at, Kick'd, scorn'd, and laugh'd at by each Page and Groome, Yet with erected heads we beare it. Onos. Alas, You have yeares, and strength to doe it; but were you (As I) a tender grisle, apt to bow, You would like me with Cloakes envelloped, Walke thus, then stamp, then stare. Unc. He will run mad I hope, and then all's mine. Tut. Why looke you Pupill, There are for the recovery of your honour Degrees of Medicines, for a tweak by the Nose A man's to travell but fixe moneths, then blow it And all is well againe: the Bastinado Requires a longer time, a yeare or two, And then 'tis buried: I grant you have been bafful'd, 'Tis but a journey of some thirty yeares And it will be forgotten. Onos. Thinke you so? Tut. Assuredly. Unc. He may make a shorter cut, But hange, or drowne himselfe, and on my life 'Twill no more trouble him. Onos. I could ne're endure Or Hemp or Water, they are dangerous tooles For youth to deale with: I will rather follow My Tutors counsell. Tut. Do so. Onos. And put in For my security, that ile not returne In thirty yeares, my whole state to my Unckle. Unc. That I like well of. On. Still provided Unckle, That at my comming home you will allow me To be of age, that I may call to accompt This Page, that hath abus'd me. Unc. 'Tis a march. On. Then Corinth, thus the bashfull Lamprias Takes leave of thee: and for this little time Of thirty yeares will labour all he can, Though he goes yong forth, to come home a man. Exeu. Scæna Quarta. Enter Euphanes and Martiall. Euph. Are your Prisoners ready? Mar. When it shall please the Queene To call them forth my Lord. Euph. Pray you doe me the favour To tell me how they have borne themselves this night Of their imprisonment? Mar. Gladly Sir; your Brother With the other Courtiers willingly receiv'd All courtesies I could offer; eat, and drank, And were exceeding merry, so dissembling Their guilt, or confident in their innocence, That I much wonder'd at it. But the Prince, That (as borne highest) should have grac'd his fall With greatest courage, is so sunck with sorrow, That to a common judgement ye would seeme To suffer like a woman: but to me, That from the experience I have had of many Looke further in him, I doe finde the deep Consideration of what's past, more fright him Then any other punishment. Euph. That is indeed True magnanimity: the other but A desperate bastard vallour. Mar. I pressed to him, And notwithstanding the Queenes strict command, (Having your Lordships promise to secure me) Offer'd to free him from his bonds, which he Refus'd, with such a sorrow mixt with scorne That it amaz'd me; yet I urg'd his Highnesse To give one Reason for't: he briefly answer'd, That he had sate in Judgement on himselfe, And found that he deserv'd them: that he was A Ravisher, and so to suffer like one, Which is the reason of my teares: he addeth, For were't not I againe should breake the Lawes, By scorning all their rigour can inflict, I should dye smiling. Euph. I forbeare to wonder That you were mov'd that saw this: I am strooke With the relation so. 'Tis very well; See all things ready. I doe wish I could Send comfort to the Prince; be ready with him; 'Tis in the Queenes breast only, which for us Bar brought in To search into were sawcinesse, to determine What she thinkes fit. Enter Leonidas with Merione (in white) Euphanes with Beliza (in black) Queene, Agenor, Conon, Martiall, with Theanor, Crates, Sosicles, Eraton. Lords, Ladies, Guard. Lord. Make way there for the Queene. Quee. Read first the Law, and what our Ancestors Have in this case provided, to deter Such like offenders: To you gentle Ladies This onely, Would I could as well give comfort, As bid you be secure from feare or doubt Of our displeasure: be as confident As if your plea were 'gainst a common man, To have all right from us; I will not grieve For what's not worth my pitty: Read the Law. Clerke Reades. Lycurgus the nineteenth against Rapes: It is provided, and publiquely enacted and confirmed, That any man of what degree soever, offering violence to the chastity of a Virgin, shall (Ipso facto) be lyable to her accusation, and according to the said Law be censur'd; Ever provided, that it shall be in the choyce of the said Virgin so abused, either to compell the Offender to Marry her without a Dowre, if so she will be satisfied, or demanding his head for the offenoe, to have that accordingly performed. Quee. You heare this: what doe you demand? Mer. The benefit The Law allowes me. Bel. For the injury Done to mine Honour, I require his head. Mer. I likewise have an eye upon mine Honour, But knowing that his death cannot restore it I aske him for my Husband. Bel. I was Ravish'd, And will have Justice. Mer. I was Ravish'd too, I kneele for mercy. Bel. I demand but what The Law allowes me. Mer. That which I desire Is by the same Law warranted. Bel. The Rape On me, hath made a forfeit of his life, Which in revenge of my disgrace I plead for. Mer. The Rape on me gives me the priviledge To be his wife, and that is all I sue for. Age. A doubtfull case. Leo. Such pretty Lawyers, yet I never saw, nor read of. Euph. May the Queene Favour your sweet plea, Madam. Bel. Is that justice? Shall one that is to suffer for a Rape Be by a Rape defended? Looke upon The publike enemy of chastity, This lustfull Satyre, whose enrag'd desires The ruine of one wretched Virgins honour Would not suffice; and shall the wrack of two Be his protection? May be I was ravish'd For his lust onely, thou for his defence; O fine evasion! shall with such a sleight Your justice be deluded? your Lawes cheated? And he that for one fact deserv'd to die, For sinning often finde impunity? But that I know thee, I would sweare thou wert A false Impostour, and subornd to this; And it may be thou art Merione: For hadst thou suffer'd truly what I have done, Thou wouldst like me complaine, and call for vengeance, And our wrongs being equall, I alone Should not desire revenge: But be it so, If thou prevaile, even he will punish it, And foolish mercy shew'd to him undoe thee, Consider, foole, before it be too late, What joyes thou canst expect from such a husband, To whom thy first, and what's more, forc'd embraces, Which men say heighten pleasure, were distastefull. Mer. 'Twas in respect, that then they were unlawfull, Unbless'd by Hymen, and left stings behind them, Which from the marriage bed are ever banish'd. Let this Court be then the image of Joves throne, Upon which grace and mercy still attend, To intercede betweene him and his Justice; And since the Law allowes as much to me As she can challenge, let the milder sentence, Which best becomes a Mother, and a Queene Now overcome; nor let your wisdome suffer, In doing right to her, I in my wrong Indure a second Ravishment. Bel. You can free him Onely from that which do's concerne your selfe, Not from the punishment that's due to me: Your injuries you may forgive, not mine; I plead mine owne just wreak, which will right both, Where that which you desire robs me of Justice; 'Tis that which I appeale to. Mer. Bloody woman, Dost thou desire his punishment? Let him live then; For any man to marry where he likes not Is still a lingring torment. Bel. For one Rape One death's sufficient, that way cannot catch me. Mer. To you I fly then, to your mercy Madam, Exempting not your Justice, be but equall; And since in no regard I come behind her, Let me not so be undervalu'd in Your highnesse favour, that the world take notice You so prefer'd her, that in her behalf You kil'd that Son, you would not save for me; Mercy, O mercy Madam. Bel. Great Queen, Justice. Age. With what a Masculine constancy the grave Lady hath heard them both? Leo. Yet how unmov'd she sits In that which most concernes her? Con. Now she rises, And having well waigh'd both their arguments, Resolves to speak. Euph. And yet againe she pauses; O Conon, such a resolution once A Roman told me he had seene in Cato Before he kill'd himself. Que. 'Tis now determin'd. Merione, I could wish I were no Queene, To give you satisfaction; no Mother Beliza, to content you; and would part, Even with my being, both might have their wishes; But since that is impossible, in few words I will deliver what I am resolved on: The end for which all profitable Lawes Were made, looks two waies onely, the reward Of innocent good men, and the punishment Of bad Delinquents: Ours, concerning Rapes, Provided that same latter clause of Marriage For him that had falne once, not then foreseeing Mankinde could prove so monstrous, to tread twice A path so horrid. The great Law-giver Draco, That for his strange severity Was said to write his sterne Decrees in blood, Made none for Parricides, presuming that No man could be so wicked; Such might be, Lycurgus answere (did he live) for this. But since I finde that in my Sonne, which was not Doubted in any else, I will adde to it; He cannot marry both, but for both dying, Both have their full revenge: You see Beliza You have your wish; with you Merione Ile spend a teare or two, so Heaven forgive thee. The. Upon my knees I do approve your judgement, And beg that you would put it into act With all speed possible; onely that I may, Having already made peace with my self, Part so with all the world: Princely Agenor I aske your pardon; yours my Lord Euphanes; And Crates, with the rest too, I forgive you; Do you the like for me: Yours, gracious Mother, I dare not ask, and yet if that my death Be like a Son of yours, though my life was not, Perhaps you may vouchsafe it: Lastly that Both these whom I have wrong'd, may wish my ashes No heavy burden, ere I suffer death, For the restoring of Meriones honour, Let me be married to her, and then dye For you Beliza. Que. Thou hast made in this Part of amends to me, and to the world, Thy suit is granted, call a Flamyn forth To do this holy work; with him a Headsman. Enter Flamyn, and Executioner. Raise up thy weeping eyes Merione, With this hand I confirme thy Marriage, Wishing that now the Gods would shew some miracle, That this might not divorse it. Cra. To that purpose I am their Minister; stand not amaz'd, To all your comforts I will do this wonder, Your Majesty (with your pardon I must speak it) Allow'd once heretofore of such a Contract, Which you repenting afterwards, revok'd it, Being fully bent to match her with Agenor, The griev'd Prince knowing this, and yet not daring To crosse what you determin'd, by an Oath Bound me and these his followers to doe something That he might once enjoy her, we sworne to it, And easily perswaded, being assur'd She was his Wife before the face of Heaven, Although some Ceremonious formes were wanting, Committed the first Rape, and brought her to him, Which broke the Marriage; but when we perceiv'd He purpos'd to abuse our ready service In the same kinde, upon the chaste Beliza, Holding our selves lesse ty'd to him then goodnesse; I made discovery of it to my Brother, Who can relate the rest. Euph. It is most true. Quee. I would it were. Euph. In every circumstance It is upon my soule: For this knowne to me, I wan Merione in my Ladies habit, To be againe (but willingly) surpriz'd, But with Agenor, and her noble Brother, With my approv'd friend Conon, with such speed She was pursu'd, that the lewd act scarce ended, The Prince (assur'd he had enjoy'd Beliza, For all the time Meriones face was cover'd) Was apprehended, and brought to your presence, But not till now discover'd, in respect I hop'd the imminent danger of the Prince, To which his loose unquenched heats had brought him, Being pursu'd unto the latest tryall Would worke in him compunction, which it has done; And these two Ladies in their feign'd contentions, To your delight I hope have serv'd as Maskers To their owne Nuptialls. Quee. My choyce was worthy When first I look'd on thee, as thou hast order'd All shall be done, and not the meanest that Plaid in this unexpected Comedy, But shall pertake our bounty: And my Lord, That with the rest you may seeme satisfi'd, If you dare venture on a Queene, not yet So farre in debt to yeares, but that she may Bring you a lusty Boy, I offer up My selfe and Kingdome during my life to you. Ag. It is a blessing which I durst not hope for, But with all joy receive. All. We all applaud it. Quee. Then on unto the Temple, where the rights Of Marriage ended, we'l finde new delights. Exeunt. Here endeth the Queene of Corinth.</field>
