      <field name="fulltext">Et primo inter apostolos incipiat PETRUS (ad condiscipulos) My deare brethren everychone, you knowe well, both all and one, howe our lord ys from us gonne to blysse that lasteth aye. Comforte nowe maye wee have nonne save his beheste to trust upon. Therfore leeve we in this wonne that never one wend awaye. Lenge we styffe in our prayer, for well I wott, withowt were, he will send us a counselour, his Ghoost, as hee beheight. Therefore lenge we right here, this faythfull fellowshippe in fere, tyll our lord, as he can us lere, send us of heaven light. Tunc exurgens Petrus in medio fratrum et dicat: My deare brethren fayer and free, Holye Scripture, leeve yee mee, fullye must fullfilled bee that Davyd sayd beforne. All of the Holye Ghooste had hee. Towchinge Judas [wytten] yee that sould our mayster for money and nowe ys cleane forlorne. Amonge us nombred that wretch was, the fayth to preach in eych place; and nowe his hyre fullye hee hasse, for hanged himselfe hasse hee. His bodye bursten for his tresspasse, soule dampned as a man withowt grace. Therfore, as the psalter mynd mase, fullfylled nowe must bee: âFiat habitatio eius deserta et non [sit] qui habitet in eo. Episcopatum eius accipiat alter.â Therefore, men that nowe binne here and fellowes that aye with us were with Jesus Christe, our mayster dere, in yearth livinge wasâ that yee that seene his powere, his myracles manye in good manere, dyinge, rysinge, both in fere, maye best nowe beare witnesse. Mattheus I read here be one, and Josephe that aye with us hath gonne, for whom we caste to lottes anonne and buske us all to praye whether of them yt ys Godes will this same office to fullfill. Tunc respondent omnes (all speake together): Wee assenten us theretyll, for this ys the beste waye. Tunc omnes apostoli genuflectent et dicat PETRUS Thow, lord, that knowest all thinge, eych hart and will of man livinge, shewe us here by some tokeninge whom that we shall take, and whether of theise ys thy likinge in Judas steed that be standinge, thy name to preach to olde and yonge, and whither that thou wilt make. Tunc Petrus mittet sortem et sors cadet super Mattheum; et dicat PETRUS This lott ys falne, brethren free, one Mattheweâall men may see. To us therfore I take thee and apostle thee make. MATTHEUS Yea, honored be God in Trynitie, though I unworthye therto bee that to you have chosen mee; dye wyll I for his sake. ANDREAS Nowe, Peeter, brother, goe we and praye, for evermore I myne maye my sovereygne howe I hard him saye here in your companyeâ JACOBUS MAJOR hee would not leave us by noe waye fatherles children, in good faye, but ryche us sone in better araye with his Ghooste gratiouslye. JOHANNES EVANGELISTA Yea, brethren, also verament to us hee sayd in good intent in yearth here while he was present and with us could lendâ THOMAS but yf so were that hee ne went, his Ghooste to us should not be sent; and yf hee yood, where wee were lent hitt hee would us send. JACOBUS MINOR Yea, sweete and likinge was his lore, and well yee wytten that there wore but a little while before, or hee to heaven steedeâ PHILIPPUS hee bade wee should not goe awaye from Jerusalem to no countrey but there abyde, soothe to saye, his heste from an highe. BARTHOLOMEUS Also hee sayd to us eychone that his forgoer, Saynt John, with water baptysed manye one while that hee was here. MATHIAS But we shall baptyse without boste fullye with the Holye Ghooste through helpe of him that ys moste, sone after, without were. âTunc Johannes quidem baptizavit aqua; vos autem baptazimini Spiritu Sancto non post multos hos dies.â SIMON Wee mynd theron, lasse and more. Yett some that standen him before asked whither hee should restore that tyme all Israell. THADDEUS And he answered anonright: âThat tyme knowe yee ne might, that in his Fathers will was pightââ for that hee must conseyle. âNon est vestrum nosse tempora vel momenta quae Pater posuit in sua potestate.â MATTHEUS Yea, brethren, that tyme hee us behight the Holye Ghoost should in us light, that wee might tell to eych wight his deedes all bydeene in Jerusalem and Judeeâ where in world soever walked weeâ and Samarye, that men should see, as after maye be seene. âAccipietis virtutem supervenientes Spiritus Sancti in vos, et eritis mihi testes in Jerusalem et in Judea, Samaria et usque ad ultimum terrae.â PETRUS Kneele we downe upon our knee and to that lord nowe praye wee. Sone I hope that hee will see to his disciples all. ANDREAS Yea, in his liffe so taught hee: aske and have with hart free; rightwise boone shall granted bee when men will on him call. Tunc omnes apostoli genuflectentes cantent âVeni, creator Spiritus.â Postea dicat JACOBUS MAJOR Come, Holye Ghoost; come, creatour! Visytt or thoughtes in this storeâ thou art mans conquerourâ and grant us, lord, thy grace! JOHANNES Thou that art called âconselorâ and send from heaven as savyour, well of liffe, lenght or langore that prayen here in this place. THOMAS Hee that in seaven monethes would conseyle grace of thy Ghooste about to deale, as thou promised for mans heale, appeare nowe synce I praye. JACOBUS MINOR Light our wyttes with thy weale; put liffe in our thoughtes lele; fulsome thy frendes that binne frayle with vertues lastinge aye. PHILIPPUS Vanishe our enemyes farre awaye and grant us peace, lord, to our paye, for while thou art our leader aye we may eschewe anoye. BARTHOLOMEUS Through thy might knowe wee maye the Father of heaven, full in good faye; and yee, his Sonne, all sooth to saye thou art in companye. MATHIAS Worshipped be thou ever and oo, the Father and the Sonne also. Lett thy Ghooste nowe from thee goe and faith that we may fynd. SIMONNDE That we asken with hart throoâ to fulsome us agaynst our foeâ grant thy men here, both one and moe, that have thee ever in mynd. Christ must speake in heaven. LYTTLE GOD Gloryous Father fayre and free, yee knowe well of your dutye that I have donne your will. They apostles that you have chosen to mee, with grace, wisdome, and prosperitye that you will them fullfill. Tunc omnes apostoli contemplantes vel orantes quousque Spiritus Sanctus missus fuit, Deus dicat: My Sonne beloved, liffe and dere, your healthfull askinge ever here that you aske ys not to arere. I knowe your cleane intent. With will full lyberall and cleare my Ghooste to them shall appere to make them wyser then the were. That ys my full assent. My Ghoost to yearth shall goe downe with seaven gyftes of renowne, ther to have by devotyon. Confyrme them to be sadd, that they may be ever readye bowne in heaven-blysse to were the crowne, ever to reigne in possession, there to be merye and gladd. My patryarkes and propheetes here that through your fayth to mee were deare, angelles and archangelles cleare, all in my blysse wonnynge, yee wotten well withowten were howe I have mended in good manere man that was lorne through Lucifere and through his owne lykinge. My Sonne I send downe from my see into a virgyn fayre and free and manhood tooke, as lyked mee, one man to have mercye, that righteousnes might saved bee. Synce man had loste his lybertye, I made man in on degree; his bale behovedd to bye. Nowe man fullye have I bought and out of bale to blysse brought. His kynd also, as me good thought, ys mixte within my godhead. Thus man that [I] thus made of nought, that Sathanas through synne hadd sought, by this waye I have so wrought non good in hell binne lead. But while I was in that degree in yearth wonynge, as man should bee, chosen I have a good meanye one which I must have mynd. Nowe they have made there mone to mee and prayed speciallye, as I see, which I must suffice with hart free or elles I were unkynd. Throughout the world they shall gonne, my deedes to preach manye one. Yett steadfastnes in them ys nonne to suffer for me anoye. Fletchinge yett they binne ichone. But when my Ghoost ys them upon, then shall they after be styffe as stonne my deedes to certyfie. Dreade of death ne no distres shall lett them of stydfastnes. Such love in them, and such goodness, my sprytte shall ever inspire that to speake and expresse all languages that ever yett was they shall have cunnynge, more and lesse, through force of heavenly fyre. Alsoe they shall have full powere to baptyze men in water clere that beleeven, in good manere, to have full mynd on mee. And on all such, withowten were, the Holye Ghooste at theire prayere shall light on them, that they may lere in fayth steadfast to bee. Nowe will I send anon in hye to my brethren in companye my Ghooste, to gadd them gratiouslyeâ for that ys there willingeâ in lycknes of fyre freelye, that they may styffned be therbye, my workes to preach more steadfastlye, and therby more connynge. Tunc Deus emittet Spiritum Sanctum in spetie ignis, et in mittendo cantent duo angeli antiphonam âAccipite Spiritum Sanctum; quorum remiseritis peccata, remittentur eisâ etc. Et cantando projecient ignem super apostolos. Finitoque Angelus in caelo dicat. ANGELUS Rest well, all that binne here. My lord you greetys, and his Ghooste dere. Hee byddes you dread noe bost nor bere of Jewes farre ne nere; but looke yee goe anon in hye into all the world by and by, and also preach the fayth meekelye and his workes so deare. THE SECOND ANGELL And through this Ghooste that I you bringe yee shall have understandinge of every lond speakinge, whatsoever the saye; and this world that ys flytchinge yee shall despyce ever all thinge, and heaven at your endinge yee shall have to your paye. PETRUS A, mercye, lord, full of might! Both I feele and see in sight the Holye Ghoost ys on to us light; [of] fyre this house full ys. ANDREAS Nowe have wee that was us beheight, for full of love my hart ys pight and wyser then ys any wight meethinke I am, iwys. JACOBUS MAJOR Yea, lord, blessed moste thou bee, for both I feele and eke I see the Holye Ghoost ys light on mee. Thus quytte I am my meede. JOHANNES For such love, by my lewtee, with this fyer in my hart can flee that death to doe for my mayster free I have no manner of dread. THOMAS And I thanke thee, both God and man, for synce this fyer light me upon of all languages well I can, and speake them at my will. JACOBUS MINOR I, before that was but a foone, am waxen as wise as Salamon. There ys no scyence but I can therone and cunnynge to fullfill. PHILIPPUS And I that never could speake thinge save Ebrewe as I learned yonge, nowe I can speake at my likinge all languages, both lowe and hye. BARTHOLOMEUS And soe styffe I am of beleevinge that I doubt neyther prynce ne kynge my maysters myracles for to mynge and for his love to dye. MATHIAS A, blessed be my mayster deare! So lyttle while can us lere. All languages that ever were upon my tonge binne light. SIMON My beleeffe ys nowe so clere, and love in harte so prynted lere, to moove my mynd in no mannere there ys no man hath might. TADDEUS Yea, sythen this fyre came from high I am waxen so wondrous sleigh that all languages farre and nigh my tonge will speake nowe aright. MATTHEUS Nowe sythen my lord to heaven steegh and send his Ghooste as hee beheight, to all distresses nowe am I drest and dye for the love of God almight. PETRUS Nowe, brethren, I read us all in fere, make wee the creede in good mannere of my lordes deedes deare that gladed us hath todaye; and I will first beginne here, synce Christ betooke me his power, the lewd hereafter that we maye lere, to further them yn the faye. Tunc Petrus incipiat: âCredo in Deum, Patrem omnipotentem, creatorem caeli et terrae,â I beleeve in God omnipotent that made heaven and yearth and fyrmament with steadfast hart and true intent, and hee ys my comford. ANDREAS âet in Jesum Christum, Filium eius, unicum dominum nostrum,â And I beleeve, where I be lent, in Jesu, his Sonne, from heaven sent, verey Cryste, that us hath kent and ys our elders lord. JACOBUS MAJOR âqui conceptus est de Spiritu Sancto, natus ex Maria virgine,â I beleeve, without bost, in Jesus Christe of mightes most, conceyved through the Holy Ghooste and borne was of Marye. JOHANNES âpassus sub Pontio Pilato, crusifixus, mortuus et sepultus.â And I beleeve, as I can see, that under Pilate suffred hee, scourged and nayled one roode-tree; and buryed was his fayre bodye. THOMAS âDescendit ad inferna; tertia die resurrexit a mortuis,â And I beleeve, and sooth can tell, that hee ghoostly went to hell, delyvered his that there did dwell, and rose the third daye. JACOBUS MINOR âascendit ad caelos, sedet ad dexteram Dei Patris omnipotentis,â And I beleeve fully this, that he stayed up to heaven-blysse and on his Fathers right hand ys, to raygne for ever and aye. PHILIPPUS âinde venturus est judicare vivos et mortuos.â And I beleeve, with hart steadfast, that hee will come at the laste and deeme mankynd as he hath caste, both the quycke and the dead. BARTHOLOMEUS âCredo in Spiritum Sanctum,â And my beleeffe shall be moste in vertue of the Holye Ghooste; and through his helpe, without boste, my lyffe I thinke to lead. MATHIAS âsanctam ecclesiam catholicam, sanctorum communionem,â And I beleeve, through Godes grace, such beleeffe as Holy Church hasseâ that Godes bodye granted us was to use in forme of bread. SIMON âremissionem peccatorum,â And I beleeve, with devotyon, of synne to have remission through Christes blood and Passion, and heaven when I am dead. TADDEUS âcarnis resurrectionem,â And I beleeve, as all wee mon, in the generall resurrection of ych bodye, when Christe ys [bowne] to deeme both good and evell. MATTHEUS âet vitam aeternam.â And I beleve, as all wee maye, everlastinge liffe, after my daye, in heaven for to have ever and aye, and so overcome the devyll. PETRUS Nowe, brethren, I read all wee goe ychone to dyvers cuntree and preach to shire and to cyttee the fayth, as Christe us beede. ANDREAS Yee, leeffe brother, kysse nowe wee yche one another before wee dye, for Godes will must fullfilled bee, and that ys nowe great neede. Tunc venient duo alienigene, quorum dicat PRIMUS ALIENIGENA A, fellowe, fellowe, for Godes pittie, are not theise men of Gallilee? Our language the can as well as wee, as ever eate I bread! SECUNDUS ALIENIGENA Well I wotte, by my lewtee, that within theise dayes three one of them could not speake with mee for to have binne dead. PRIMUS ALIENIGENA Of all languages that binne hereby that come to Mesopotamye, Capadocie and Jurye, the jangle without weeneâ of the Ile of Pontus, and Asye, Fryzeland and Pamphilye, Egipt, right into Lybie that ys byesyde Syrene.
