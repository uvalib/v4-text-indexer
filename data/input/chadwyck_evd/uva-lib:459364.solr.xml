      <field name="fulltext">The Tragedy of Locrine, the eldest Son of King Brutus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Scena Prima. Enter Atey with Thunder and Lightning, all in black, with a burning Torch in one hand, and a bloudie Sword in the other hand; and presently let there come forth a Lion running after a Bear or any other beast, then come forth an Archer, who must kill the Lion in a dumb show, and then depart. Remain Atey. Atey. In pÅnam sectatur &amp; Vmbra. A mighty Lion, ruler of the woods, Of wondrous strength and great proportion, With hideous noise scaring the trembling trees, With yelling clamours shaking all the earth, Traverst the groves, and chac't the wandring beasts: Long did he range among the shadie trees, And drave the silly beasts before his face; When suddenly from out a-thorny bush A dreadfull Archer with his bow ybent, Wounded the Lion with a dismal shaft, So he him strook, that it drew forth the bloud, And fill'd his furious heart with fretting ire; But all in vain he threatneth teeth and pawes, And sparkleth fire from forth his flaming eyes, For the sharp shaft gave him a mortal wound: So valiant Brute, the terrour of the world, Whose only looks did scare his enemies, The Archer Death brought to his latest end. Oh what may long abide above this ground, In state of bliss and healthfull happiness! Exit. Scena Secunda. Enter Brutus carried in a chair, Locrine, Camber, Albanact, Corineius, Guendelin, Assaracus, Debon, Thrasimachus. Brutus. Most loyal Lords, and faithfull followers, That have with me, unworthy General, Passed the greedy gulf of th'Ocean, Leaving the confines of fair Italie, Behold, your Brutus draweth nigh his end, And I must leave you, though against my will; My sinews shrunk, my numbred senses fail, A chilling cold possesseth all my bones, Black ugly death with visage pale and wan, Presents himself before my dazeled eyes, And with his dart prepared is to strike: These armes, my Lords, these never daunted armes, That oft have quell'd the courage of my foes, And eke dismay'd my neighbour's arrogance, Now yield to death, o'relaid with crooked age, Devoid of strength and of their proper force; Even as the lusty Cedar worn with yeares, That far abroad her dainty odour throws, 'Mongst all the daughters of proud Lebanon, This heart, my Lords, this ne're appalled heart, That was a terror to the bordring lands, A dolefull scourge unto my neighbour Kings, Now by the weapons of unpartial death, Is clove asunder and bereft of life; As when the sacred oak with thunderbolts, Sent from the fierie circuit of the heavens, Sliding along the aires celestial vaults, Is rent and cloven to the very roots. In vain therefore I struggle with this foe, Then welcome death, since God will have it so. Assar. Alas my Lord, we sorrow at your case, And grieve to see your person vexed thus; But whatsoe're the fates determin'd have, It lieth not in us to disanull, And he that would annihilate his mind, Soaring with Icarus too near the Sun, May catch a fall with young Bellerophon: For when the fatal sisters have decreed To separate us from this earthly mould, No mortal force can countermand their minds: Then, worthy Lord, since there's no way but one, Cease your laments, and leave your grievous moan. Corin. Your Highness knows how many victories, How many Trophees I erected have Triumphantly in every place we came; The Grecian Monarch, warlike Pandrassus, And all the crew of the Molossians: Goffarius the arme-strong King of Gaules, Have felt the force of our victorious armes, And to their cost beheld our Chivalrie, Where ere Ancora handmaid of the Sun, Where ere the Sun-bright gardiant of the day, Where e're the joyfull day with cheerfull light, Where e're the light illuminates the world, The Trojans glory flies with golden wings, Wings that do soar beyond fell envious flight, The fame of Brutus and his followers Pierceth the skies, and with the skies the throne Of mighty Jove, Commander of the world, Then, worthy Brutus, leave these sad laments, Comfort your self with this your great renown, And fear not Death, though he seem terrible. Brutus. Nay, Corinus, you mistake my mind, In construing wrong the cause of my complaints, I fear'd not t' yield my self to fatall death, God knowes it was the least of all my thoughts, A greater care torments my very bones, And makes me tremble at the thought of it, And in your Lordings doth the substance lie. Thrasi. Most noble Lord, if ought your loyal Peers Accomplish may, to ease your lingring grief, I in the name of all protest to you, That we will boldly enterprise the same, Were it to enter to black Tartarus, Where triple Cerberus with his venomous throat, Scareth the Ghosts with high resounding noyse, We'll either rent the bowels of the earth, Searching the entrails of the bruitish earth, Or with his Ixions overdaring soon, Be bound in Chains of everduring Steele. Bru. Then hearken to your Soveraign's latest words, In which I will unto you all unfold, Our royall mind and resolute intent. When golden Hebe, Daughter to great Jove, Cover'd my manly Cheeks with youthfull Down, Th'unhappy slaughter of my lucklesse Sire, Drove me and old Assarachus mine Eame, As exiles from the bounds of Italy, So that perforce we were constrain'd to flye To Grecians Monarch, noble Pandrassus, There I alone did undertake your cause, There I restor'd your antique liberty, Though Grecia frown'd, and all Molossia storm'd, Though brave Antigonus, with martiall band, In pitched field encountred me and mine, Though Pandrassus and his contributaries, With all the rout of their confederates, Sought to deface our glorious memory, And wipe the name of Trojans from the earth: Him did I captivate with this mine Arme, And by compulsion forc't him to agree To certain Articles, which there we did propound. From Grecia through the boisterous Hellespont, We came into the Fields of Lestrigon, Whereat our Brother Corineius was; Which when we passed the Cicilian gulf, And so transfretting the Illician sea, Arrived on the coasts of Aquitain; Where with an Army of his barbarous Gaules Goffarius and his Brother Gathelus Encountring with our hoast, sustain'd the foile, And for your sakes my Turnus there I lost: Turnus that slew six hundred men at Armes All in an hour, with his sharp Battle-Axe. From thence upon the stronds of Albion To Corus Haven happily we came, And quell'd the Giants, come of Albions race, With Gogmagog, Son to Samotheus, The cursed Captain of that damned crew, And in that Isle at length I placed you. Now let me see if my laborious toyles, If all my care, if all my grievous wounds, If all my diligence were well employ'd. Corin. When first I followed thee and thine (brave King) I hazarded my life and dearest blood, To purchase favour at your Princely hands, And for the same in dangerous attempts In sundry conflicts, and in divers broyles, I shew'd the courage of my manly minde: For this I combated with Gathelus, The Brother to Goffarius of Gaule: For this I fought with furious Gogmagog, A savage Captain of a savage crew: And for these deeds brave Cornwall I receiv'd, A gratefull gift given by a gracious King; And for this gift, this life and dearest blood, Will Corineius spend for Brutus good. Deb. And what my friend, brave Prince, hath vow'd to you, The same will Debon doe unto his end. Bru. Then, loyal Peers, since you are all agreed, And resolute to follow Brutus hoasts, Favour my Sons, favour those Orphans, Lords, And shield them from the dangers of their foes. Locrine, the Columne of my Family, And onely Pillar of my weakned age: Locrine, draw near, draw near unto thy Sire, And take thy latest blessings at his hands; And for thou art the eldest of my Sons, Be thou a Captain to thy Brethren, And imitate thy aged Fathers steps, Which will conduct thee to true honours gate: For if thou follow sacred virtues lore, Thou shalt be crowned with a Lawrel branch, And wear a wreathe of sempiternall fame, Sorted amongst the glorious happy ones. Locrin. If Locrine do not follow your advice, And beare himself in all things like a Prince That seeks to amplifie the great renown, Left unto him for an inheritance By those that were his Ancestours, Let me be flung into the Ocean, And swallowed in the bowels of the earth. Or let the ruddy lightning of great Jove, Descend upon this my devolted head. Brutus taking Guendoline by the hand. Bru. But for I see you all to be in doubt, Who shall be matched with our Royal Son, Locrine, receive this present at my hand: A gift more rich then are the wealthy Mines Found in the Bowels of America. Thou shalt be spoused to fair Guendoline: Love her, and take her, for she is thine own, If so thy Unckle and her self do please. Corin. And herein how your Highnesse honours me, It cannot now be in my speech exprest: For carefull Parents glory not so much At their honour and promotion, As for to see the issue of their blood Seated in honour and prosperity. Guend. And far be it from my pure Maiden thoughts, To contradict her aged Fathers will. Therefore since he to whom I must obey, Hath given me now unto your Royal Self, I will not stand aloof from off the lure, Like crafty Dames that most of all deny That, which they most desire to possesse. Brutus turning to Locrine. Locrine kneeling. Then now my son thy part is on the stage, For thou must bear the person of a King. Puts the Crown on his head. Locrine stand up, and wear the regal Crown, And think upon the state of Majesty, That thou with honour well maist wear the Crown, And if thou tendrest these my latest words, As thou requir'st my soul to be at rest, As thou desirest thine own security, Cherish and love thy new betrothed wife. Locrine. No longer let me well enjoy the Crown, Then I do peerlesse Guendoline. Brut. Camber. Cam. My Lord. Brut. The glory of mine age, And darling of thy mother Junoger, Take thou the South for thy dominion, From thee there shall proceed a royal race, That shall maintain the honor of this land, That sway the regal scepter with their hands. Turning to Alabanact. And Albanact thy fathers onely joy, Youngest in years, but not the young'st in mind, A perfect pattern of all chivalrie, Take thou the North for thy dominion, A country full of hills and ragged rocks, Replenished with fierce untamed beasts, As correspondent to thy martial thoughts. Live long my sons with endlesse happinesse, And bear firm concordance among your selves, Obey the counsels of these fathers grave, That you may better bear out violence, But suddenly through weaknesse of my age, And the defect of youthfull puissance, My Maladie increaseth more and more, And cruel death hasteneth his quickned pace, To dispossesse me of my earthly shape, Mine eyes wax dim, o're-cast with clouds of age. The pangs of death compasse my crazed bones, Thus to you all my blessings I bequeath, And with my blessings, this my fleeting soul. My glasse is run, and all my miseries Do end with life: death closeth up mine eyes, My soul in hast flies to the Elisian fields. He dieth. Loc. Accursed starrs, damn'd and accursed starrs, To abreviate my noble father's life, Hard-hearted gods, and too envious fates, Thus to cut off my father's fatal thred, Brutus that was a glory to us all, Brutus that was a terror to his foes, Alasse too soon by Demagorgon's knife, The martial Brutus is bereft of life. No sad complaints may move just Lacus. Corin. No dreadfull threats can fear judge Rhodomanth, Wert thou as strong as mighty Hercules, That tam'd the hugie monsters of the world, Plaid'st thou as sweet, on the sweet sounding Lute, As did the spouse of fair Euridice, That did enchant the waters with his noise, And made the stones, birds, beasts, to lead a dance, Constrained the hilly trees to follow him, Thou could'st not move the judge of Crebus, Nor move compassion in grim Pluto's heart, For fatal Mors expecteth all the world, And every man must tread the way of death, Brave Tantalus, the valiant Pelops sire, Guest to the gods, suffred untimely death, And old Fleithonus husband to the morn, And eke grim Minos whom just Jupiter Deign'd to admit unto his sacrifice, The thundring trumpets of bloud-thirsty Mars. The fearfull rage of fell Tisiphoen. The boistrous waves of humid Ocean, Are instruments and tools of dismal death. Then noble cousin cease to mourn his chance, Whose age and years were signes that he should die. It resteth now that we interre his bones, That was a terror to his enemies. Take up his coarse, and Princes hold him dead, Who while he liv'd, upheld the Troyan state. Sound drums and trumpets, march to Trinovant, There to provide our chieftains funeral. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Enter Strumbo above in a gown, with ink and paper in his hand saying. Strum. Either the four Elements, the seven Planets and all the particular Starrs of the Pole Antastick, are adversitive against me, or else I was begotten and born in the wain of the Moon, when every thing, as Lactantius in his fourth book of Constultations doth say, goeth arsward. I Masters, I, you may laugh, but I must weep; you may joy, but I must sorrow; shedding salt tears from the watry fountains of my moist dainty fair eyes, along my comely and smooth cheeks, in as great plenty as the water runneth from the bucking-tubs, or red wine out of the Hogs-heads: for trust me gentlemen and my very good friends, and so forth: the little god, nay the desperate god Cuprit, with one of his vengible bird-bolts, hath shot me unto the heel: so not only, but also, oh fine phrase, I burn, I burn, and I burn a, in love, in love, and in love a, ah Strumbo, what hast thou seen, not Dina with the Asse Tom? Yea with these eyes thou hast seen her, and therefore pull them out: for they will work thy bail. Ah Strumbo, hast thou heard the voice of the Nightingale, but a voice sweeter then hers, yea with these ears hast thou heard them, and therefore cut them off, for they have caus'd thy sorrow. Nay Strumbo, kill thy self, drown thy self, hang thy self, starve thy self. Oh but then I shall leave my sweet heart. Oh my heart! Now pate for thy Master, I will dite an aliquant love-pistle to her, and then she hearing the grand verbosity of my scripture, will love me presently, Let him write a little, and then read. My pen is naught, Gentlemen lend me a knife, I think the more haste the worst speed. Then write again, and after read. So it is, Mistris Dorothie, and the sole essence of my soul, that the little sparkles of affection kindled in me towards your sweet self, hath now increased to a great flame, and will ere it be long consume my poor heart, except you with the pleasant water of your secret fountain, quench the furious heat of the same. Alass, I am a Gentleman of good fame, and name, majesticall, in apparell comely, in gate portly. Let not therefore your gentle heart be so hard, as to despise a proper tall young man of a handsome life, and by despising him, not only but also to kill him. Thus expecting time and tide, I bid you farewell. Your Servant, Signior Strumbo. Oh wit, O pate, O memory, O hand, O Ink, O paper. Well, now I will send it away. Trompart, Trompart, what a Villain is this? Why sirrha, come when your Master calls you. Trompart. Trompart entering saith Anon, sir. Strumbo. Thou knowest, my pretty Boy, what a good Master I have been to thee ever since I took thee into my service. Trom. I, sir. Srum. And how I have cherished thee alwayes, as if thou hadst been the fruit of my loynes, flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone. Trom. I, sir. Strum. Then shew thy self herein a trusty servant, and carry this Letter to Mistress Dorothy, and tell her. Speaking in his eare. Exit Trompart. Strum. Nay, Masters, you shall see a Marriage by and by. But here she comes. Now must I frame my amorous passions. Enter Dorothy and Trompart. Doro. Signior Strumbo, well met, I received your Letters by your man here, who told me a pittifull story of your anguish, and so understanding your passions were so great, I came hither speedily. Strum. Oh, my sweet and pigsney, the fecundity of my ingenie is not so great, that may declare unto you the sorrowfull sobs, and broken sleeps that I suffered for your sake; and therefore I desire you to receive me into your familiarity. For your Love doth lie, As near and as nigh: Unto my heart within, As mine Eye to my Nose, My Leg unto my Hose, And my Flesh unto my Skin. Dor. Truly, M. Strumbo, you speak too learnedly for me to understand the drift of your mind, and therefore tell your tale in plain termes, and leave off your dark riddles. Strum. Alass, Mistresse Dorothy, this is my luck, that when I most would, I cannot be understood: so that my great learning is an inconvenience unto me. But to speak in plain termes, I love you, Mistresse Dorothy, if you like to accept me into your familiarity. Dor. If this be all I am content. Turning to the people. Strum. Say'st thou so, sweet wench, let me lick thy Toes. Farewell, Mistresse. If any of you be in love, provide ye a Cap-case full of new coyn'd words, and then shall you soon have the succado de labres, and something else. Exeunt. Scena Quarta. Enter Locrine, Guendoline, Camber, Albanact, Corineius, Assarachus, Debon, Thrasimachus. Locrine. Uncle and Princes of brave Britany, Since that our noble Father is entomb'd, As best beseem'd so brave a Prince as he, If so you please, this day my Love and I, Within the Temple of Concordia, Will solemnize our royall marriage. Thra. Right noble Lord, your subjects every one, Must needs obey your Highnesse at command, Especially in such a cause as this, That much concerns your Highnesse great content. Locr. Then frolick, Lordings, to fair Concords walls, Where we will passe the day in Knightly sports, The night in Dancing and in figured Maskes, And offer to God Risus all our sports. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Scena Prima. Enter Atey as before, after a little Lightning and Thundring, let there come forth this show: Perseus and Andromeda, hand in hand, and Cepheus also with Swords and Targets. Then let there come out of another door Phineus, all black in Armour, with Ãthiopians after him, driving in Perseus, and having taken away Andromeda, let them depart. Atey remaining, saying. Regit omnia numen. When Perseus married fair Andromeda, The onely Daughter of King Cepheus, He thought he had establisht well his Crown, And that his Kingdome should for aye endure. But loe proud Phineus with a band of men, Contriv'd of sun-burnt Ãthiopians, By force of Armes the Bride he took from him, And turn'd their joy into a flood of teares. So fares it with young Locrine and his Love, He thinks this marriage tendeth to his weale, But this foule day, this foule accursed day, Is the beginning of his miseries. Behold where Humber and his Scythians Approcheth nigh with all his warlike train, I need not I, the sequel shall declare, What tragick chances fell out in this Warre. Exeunt. Scena Secunda. Enter, Humber, Hubba, Estrilo, Segar, and their Souldiers. Hum. At length the Snaile doth climbe the highest tops, Ascending up the stately Castle Walls, At length the water with continual drops, Doth penetrate the hardest marble stone, At length we are arrived in Albion, Nor could the barbarous Dacian soveraign, Nor yet the ruler of brave Belgia Stay us from cutting over to this Ile; Whereas I hear a troop of Phrygians Under the conduct of Posthumius son, Have pitch'd up lordly pavillions, And hope to prosper in this lovely Ile: But I will frustrate all their foolish hope, And teach them that the Scythian Emperour Leads fortune tied in a chain of gold, Constraining her to yield unto his will, And grace him with their Regal diadem: Which I will have, maugre their treble hosts, And all the power their pettie Kings can make. Hubba. If she that rules fair Rhamnis golden gate, Grant us the honour of the victory, As hitherto she alwayes favour'd us, Right noble father, we will rule the land, Enthroniz'd in seats of Topace stones, That Locrine and his brethren all may know, None must be King but Humber and his son. Hum. Courage my son, fortune shall favour us, And yield to us the coronet of bays, That decketh none but noble conquerours: But what saith Elstrid to these regions? How liketh she the temperature thereof? Are they not pleasant in her gracious eyes? Estr. The plains, my Lord, garnisht with Flora's wealth, And overspread with party-coloured flowers, Do yield sweet contentation to my mind, The aerie hills enclos'd with shadie groves, The groves replenisht with sweet chirping birds, The birds resounding heavenly melodie, Are equall to the groves of Thessaly, Where PhÅbus with the learned Ladies nine, Delight themselves with musick harmony, And from the moisture of the mountain tops, The silent springs dance down with murmuring streams, And water all the ground with chrystal waves, The gentle blasts of Eurus modest wind, Moving the pittering leaves of Silvane's woods, Do equall it with Tempe's paradice, And thus comforted all to one effect, Do make me think these are the happy Iles, Most fortunate, if Humber may them win. Hubba. Madam, where resolution leads the way, And courage follows with emboldened pace, Fortune can never use her tyranny; For valiantnesse is like unto a rock That standeth on the waves of Ocean, Which though the billows beat one every side, And Boreas fell with his tempestuous storms, Bloweth upon it with a hideous clamour, Yet it remaineth still unmoveable. Hum. Kingly resolv'd, thou glory of thy sire: But worthy Segar, what uncouth novelties Bring'st thou unto our royal Majesty? Seg. My Lord, the youngest of all Brutus sonnes, Stout Albanact, with millions of men, Approacheth nigh, and meaneth e're the morn, To try your force by dint of fatal sword. Hum. Tut, let him come with millions of hosts, He shall find entertainment good enough, Yea fit for those that are our enemies: For we'll receive them at the lances points, And massacre their bodies with our blades: Yea though they were in number infinite, More then the mighty Babylonian Queen, Semiramis the ruler of West, Brought 'gainst the Emperour of the Scythians, Yet would we not start back one foot from them: That they might know we are invincible. Hub. Now by great Jove the supreme King of heaven, And the immortal gods that live therein, When as the morning shews his chearfull face, And Lucifer mounted upon his steed, Brings in the chariot of the golden sun, I'le meet young Albanact in the open field, And crack my launce upon his burganet, To try the valour of his boyish strength: There will I shew such ruthfull spectacles And cause so great effusion of bloud, That all his boyes shall wonder at my strength: As when the warlike Queen of Amazon, Penthesilea armed with her launce, Girt with a corslet of bright shining steel, Coopt up the faint-heart Grecians in the camp. Hum. Spoke like a warlike Knight, my noble son, Nay, like a Prince that seeks his father's joy. Therefore to morrow ere fair Titan shine, And bashfull Eos messenger of light, Expells the liquid sleep from out mens eyes, Thou shalt conduct the right wing of the host, The left wing shall be under Segar's charge, The rearward shall be under me my self; And lovely Estrild fair and gracious, If fortune favour me in mine attempts, Thou shalt be Queen of lovely Albion. Fortune shall favour me in mine attempts, And make thee Queen of lovely Albion. Come let us in and muster up our train, And furnish up our lusty souldiers, That they may be a bulwark to our state, And bring our wished joyes to perfect end. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Enter Strumbo, Dorothy, Trompart, cobling shooes, and singing. Trom. We Coblers lead a merry life: All. Dan, dan, dan, dan: Strum. Void of all envy and of strife: All. Dan diddle dan. Dor. Our ease is great, our labour small: All. Dan, dan, dan, dan. Strum. And yet our gains be much withall: All. Dan diddle dan. Dor. With this art so fine and fair: All. Dan, dan, dan, dan. Trom. No occupation may compare: All. Dan diddle dan. Strum. For merry pastime and joyfull glee: Dan, dan, dan, dan. Dor. Most happy men we Coblers be: Dan diddle dan. Trum. The can stands full of nappy ale, Dan: dan: dan: dan: Strum. In our shop still withouten fail: Dan diddle dan. Dor. This is our meat, this is our food: Dan: dan: dan: dan: Trum. This brings us to a merry mood: Dan diddle dan. Strum. This makes us work for company: Dan, dan, dan, dan: Dor. To pull the Tankards cheerfully: Dan diddle dan. Trum. Drink to thy husband Dorothie, Dan, dan, dan, dan: Dor. Why then my Strumbo there's to thee: Dan diddle dan: Strum. Drink thou the rest Trumpart amain: Dan, dan, dan, dan. Dor. When that is gone, we'll fill't again: Dan diddle dan. Cap. The poorest state is farthest from annoy, How merrily he sitteth on his stool: But when he sees that needs he must be prest, He'll turn his note and sing another tune, Ho, by your leave Master Cobler. Strum. You are welcome gentleman, what will you any old shooes or buskins, or will you have your shooes clouted, I will do them as well as any Cobler in Cathnes whatsoever? Captain shewing him press-money. O Master Cobler, you are far deceived in me, for don you see this? I come not to buy any shooes, but to buy your self; come sir, you must be a souldier in the King's cause. Strum. Why, but hear you sir, has your King any Commission to take any man against his will. I promise you, I can scant believe it, or did he give you Commission? Cap. O sir, ye need not care for that, I need no Commission: hold here, I command you in the name of our King Albanact, to appear to morrow in the townhouse of Cathnes. Strum. King Nactabell, I cry God mercy, what have we to do with him, or he with us? but you sir master capontail, draw your pasteboard, or else I promise you, I'le give you a canvasado with a bastinado over your shoulders, and teach you to come hither with your implements. Cap. I pray thee good fellow be content, I do the Kings command. Strum. Put me out of your book then. Cap. I may not. Srumbo Snatching up a staff. No will, come sir, will your stomack serve you, by gogs blew hood and halidom, I will have about with you. Fight both. Enter Thrasimachus. Thra. How now, what noise, what sudden clamor's this? How now, my Captain and the Cobler so hard at it? Sirs what is your quarrel? Cap. Nothing, sir, but that he will not take press-mony. Thra. Here good fellow, take it at my command, Unlesse you mean to be stretch'd. Strum. Truly, Master gentleman, I lack no mony, if you please I will resigne it to one of these poor fellows. Thrasi. No such matter, Look you be at the common house to morrow. Exit Thrasimachus and the Captain. Strum. O wife I have spun a fair thred, if I had been quiet, I had not been prest, and therefore well may I wayment; But come sirra, shut up, for we must to the warrs. Exeunt. Scena Quarta. Enter Albanact, Debon. Thrasimachus, and the Lords. Alb. Brave Cavaliers, Princes of Albany, Whose trenchant blades with our deceased sire, Passing the frontiers of brave Grecia, Were bathed in our enemies lukewarme bloud, Now is the time to manifest your wills, Your haughty minds and resolutions, Now opportunity is offred To try your courage and your earnest zeal, Which you alwayes protest to Albanact, For at this time, yea at this present time, Stout fugitives come from the Scithians bounds Have pestred every place with mutinies: But trust me, Lordings, I will never cease To persecute the rascal runnagates, Till all the rivers stained with their bloud, Shall fully shew their fatal overthrow. Deb. So shall your Highnesse merit great renown, And imitate your aged father's steps. Alb. But tell me cousin, cam'st thou through the plains? And saw'st thou there the faint-heart fugitives Mustring their weather-beaten souldiers, What order keep they in their marshalling? Thra. After we past the groves of Caledone, We did behold the stragling Scithians Camp, Repleat with men, stor'd with munition; There might we see the valiant minded Knights Fetching carriers along the spacious plains, Humber and Hubba arm'd in azure blew, Mounted upon their coursers white as snow, Went to behold the pleasant flowring fields; Hector and Troilus, Priamus lovely sons, Chasing the Grecians over Simoeis, Were not to be compared to these two Knights. Alba. Well hast thou painted out in eloquence The portraiture of Humber and his son; As fortunate as was Policrates, Yet should they not escape our conquering swords, Or boast of ought but of our clemencie. Enter Strumbo and Trompart crying often; Wild fire and pitch, wild fire and pitch, &amp;c. Thra. What sirs, what mean you by these clamors made, Those outcries raised in our stately Court? Strum. Wild-fire and pitch, wild-fire and pitch. Thra. Villains I say, tell us the cause hereof? Strum. Wild-fire and pitch, wild-fire and pitch. Thra. Tell me you villains, why you make this noise, Or with my Lance, I will prick your bowels out. Al. Where are your houses, where's your dwelling place? Strum. Place, Ha, ha, ha, laugh a month and a day at him; place! I cry God mercy, why doe you think that such poor honest men as we be, hold our habitacles in Kings Palaces: Ha, ha, ha. But because you seem to be an abominable Chieftain, I will tell you your state. From the top to the toe, From the head to the shoe; From the beginning to the ending. From the building to the burning. This honest fellow and I had our mansion Cottage in the suburbs of this City, hard by the Temple of Mercury. And by the common Souldiers of the Shittens, the Scythians what doe you call them? with all the suburbs were burnt to the ground, and the ashes are left there for the Countrey Wives to wash bucks withall. And that which grieves me most, my loving Wife, O cruell strife; the wicked flames did roast. And therefore Captain Crust, We will continually cry, Except you seek a remedy, Our Houses to reedifie, Which now are burnt to dust. Both cry. Wild-fire and Pitch, Wild-fire and Pitch. Alba. Well, we must remedy these outrages, And throw revenge upon their hatefull heads, And you good fellows for your houses burnt, We will remunerate your store of Gold, And build your houses by our Pallace gate. Strumbo. Gate! O petty treason to my person, no where else but by your backside; Gate! oh how I am vexed in my Coller: Gate! I cry God mercy, do you hear, Master King? If you mean to gratifie such poor men as we be, you must build our houses by the Tavern. Alba. It shall be done, sir. Strum. Near the Tavern, I, by Lady, sir, it was spoken like a good fellow. Do you hear, sir? when our house is builded, if you do chance to passe or re-passe that way, we will bestow a quart of the best Wine upon you? Exit. Alb. It grieves me, Lordings, that my Subjects goods Should thus be spoyled by the Scythians, Who as you see with lightfoot forragers, Depopulate the places where they come, But cursed Humber thou shalt rue the day That ere thou cam'st unto Cathnesia. Exeunt. Scena Quinta. Enter Humber, Hubba, Segar, Trussier, and their Soldiers. Hum. Hubba, go take a Coronet of our Horse, As many Launciers, and light-armed Knights, As may suffice for such an enterprise, And place them in the Grove of Calcedon, With these, when as the skirmish doth encrease, Retire thou from the shelters of the wood, And set upon the weakned Trojans backs, For policy joyned with Chivalry, Can never be put back from victory. Exeunt. Enter Albanact, Clownes with him. Alb. Thou base born Hunne, how durst thou be so bold, As once to menace warlike Albanact? The great Commander of these Regions, But thou shalt buy thy rashnesse with thy death, And rue too late thy over-bold attempts, For with this Sword, this Instrument of death, That hath been drenched in my Foe-mens blood, I'le separate thy body from thy head, And set that Coward blood of thine abroach. Strum. Nay with this staffe great Strumbo's Instrument, I'le crack thy Cockscombe, paltry Scythian. Hum. Nor wreak I of thy threats, thou princox boy, Nor doe I fear thy foolish insolency, And but thou better use thy bragging blade, Then thou dost rule thy overflowing tongue, Superbious Britain, thou shalt know too soon The force of Humber and his Scythians. Let them fight. Humber and his Soldiers run in. Strum. O horrible, terrible. Scena Sexta. Sound the Alarm. Enter Humber and his Soldiers. Hum. How bravely this young Britain, Albanact, Darteth abroad the thunderbolts of warre, Beating down millions with his furious mood; And in his glory triumphs over all, Moving the massie squadrants of the ground; Heap hills on hills, to scale the starry skie: As when Briareus armed with an hundred hands, Flung forth an hundred mountains at great Jove, And when the monstrous gyant Monichus Hurl'd mount Olimpus at great Mars his targe, And shot huge Cedars at Minerva's shield. How doth he overlook with haughty front My fleeting hoasts, and lifts his lofty face Against us all that now do fear his force, Like as we see the wrathfull Sea from farre, In a great mountain heapt with hideous noyse, With thousand billowes beat against the Ships, And tosse them in the Waves like Tennis Balls. Sound the Alarm. Humb. Ay me, I fear my Hubba is surpris'd. Sound again. Enter Albanact. Alba. Follow me, Souldiers, follow Albanact; Pursue the Scythians flying through the field: Let none of them escape with victory: That they may know the Britains force is more Than all the power of the trembling Hunnes. Thra. Forward, brave soldiers, forward, keep the chase, He that takes captive Humber or his Son, Shall be rewarded with a Crown of gold. Sound alarm, then let them fight, Humber give back Hubba enters at their backs, and kills Debon, let Strumbo fall down, Albanact run in, and afterwards enter wounded. Alba. Injurious fortune, hast thou crost me thus? Thus in the morning of my victories, Thus in the prime of my felicity To cut me off by such hard overthrow. Hadst thou no time thy rancour to declare, But in the spring of all my dignities? Hadst thou no place to spit thy venome out But on the person of young Albanact? I that ere while did scare mine enemies, And drove them almost to a shamefull flight: I that ere while full Lyon-like did fare Amongst the dangers of the thick throng'd pikes, Must now depart most lamentably slain By Humber's treacheries and fortunes spights: Curst be their charmes, damn'd be her cursed charmes That doth delude the wayward hearts of men, Of men that trust unto her fickle wheele, Which never leaveth turning upside down. O gods, O heavens, allot me but the place Where I may finde her hatefull mansion, I'le passe the Alpes to watry Meroe, Where fiery PhÅbus in his charriot, The wheeles whereof are dect with Emeralds, Cast such a heat, yea such a scorching heat, And spoileth Flora of her chequered grasse, I'le overturn the mountain Caucasus, Where fell ChimÃ¦ra in her triple shape, Rolleth hot flames from out her monstrous panch, Scaring the beasts with issue of her gorge, I'le passe the frozen Zone where Icy flakes Stopping the passage of the fleeting ships Do lie, like mountains in the congeal'd Sea, Where if I find that hatefull house of Hers, I'le pull the fickle wheele from out her hands, And tie her self in everlasting bands: But all in vain I breathe these threatnings, The day is lost, the Hunnes are conquerors, Debon is slain, my men are done to death, The currents swift swimme violently with blood, And last, O that this last night so long last, My self with wounds past all recovery, Must leave my Crown for Humber to possesse. Strum. Lord have mercy upon us, Masters, I think this is a holy-day, every man lies sleeping in the fields, but God knowes full sore against their wills. Thra. Fly, noble Albanact, and save thy self, The Scythians follow with great celerity, And there's no way but fight, or speedy death, Flie, noble Albanact, and save thy self. Sound the Alarm. Alba. Nay let them flie that fear to die the death, That tremble at the name of fatall Mors, Ne're shall proud Humber boast or brag himself, That he hath put young Albanact to flight: And least he should triumph at my decay, This sword shall reave his Master of his life, That oft hath sav'd his Masters doubtfull life: But oh my brethren if you care for me, Revenge my death upon his traiterous head. Et vos queis domus est nigrantis regia ditis, Qui regitis rigido stigios moderamine lucos: Nox cÃ¦ci regina poli furialis Erinnis, Diique deÃ¦que omnes Albanum tollite regem, Tollite flumineis undis rigidaque palude Nunc me fata vocant, hoc condam pectore ferrum. Thrust himself through Enter Trumpart. O what hath he done? his Nose bleeds: but I smell a Fox, Look where my Master lies, Master, Master. Strum. Let me alone, I tell thee, for I am dead. Trum. Yet one, good, good, Master. Strum. I will not speak, for I am dead I tell thee. Trum. And is my Master dead? O sticks and stones, brickbats and bones, and is my Master dead? O you cockatrices, and you bablatrices, that in the woods dwell: You briers and brambles, you Cook shops and shambles, come howle and yell. With howling and screeking, with wailing and weeping, come you to lament. O Colliers of Croyden, and Rusticks of Royden, and Fishers of Kent. For Strumbo the Cobler, the fine merry Cobler of Cathnes town: At this same stoure, at this very hour lies dead on the ground. O Master, thieves, thieves, thieves. Strum. Where be they? cox me tunny, bobekin, let me be rising, be gone, we shall be robb'd by and by. Scena Octava. Enter Humber, Hubba, Segar, Thrassier, Estrild, and the Souldiers. Hum. Thus from the dreadful shocks of furious Mars's Thundring alarmes, and Rhamnusia's Drum We are retired with joyfull victory, The slaughter'd Trojans squeltring in their blood, Infect the aire with their carcasses, And are a prey for every ravenous bird. Estrild. So perish they that are our enemies. So perish they that love not Humber's weale. And mighty Jove, Commander of the world, Protect my love from all false treacheries. Hum. Thanks lovely Estrild, solace to my soule. But, valiant Hubba, for thy Chivalry Declar'd against the men of Albany, Loe here a flowring garland wreath'd of bay, As a reward for this thy forward minde. Set it on his head. Hub. This unexpected honour, noble Sire, Will prick my courage unto braver deeds, And cause me to attempt such hard exploits, That all the world shall sound of Hubba's name. Hum. And now, brave Soldiers, for this good success, Carouse whole cups of Amazonian Wine, Sweeter then Nectar or Ambrosia, And cast away the Clods of cursed care, With goblets crown'd with Semeleius gifts, Now let us march to Abis silver streames, That clearly glide along the Champane fields, And moist the grassy meads with humid drops. Sound Drums and Trumpets, sound up cheerfully, Sith we return with joy and victory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Scena prima. Enter Ate as before. The dumb show. A Crocadile sitting on a rivers bank, and a little Snake stinging it. Then let both of them fall into the water. Ate. Scelera in authorem's adunt. High on a bank by Nilus boystrous streams, Fearfully sat th'Egyptian Crocodile, Dreadfully grinding in her sharp long teeth, The broken bowels of a silly fish, His back was arm'd against the dint of spear, With shields of brasse that shin'd like burnisht gold, And as he stretched forth his cruel paws, A subtil Adder creeping closely near, Thrusting his forked sting into his claws, Privily shead his poison through his bones, Which made him swell that there his bowels burst, That did so much in his own greatnesse trust. So Humber having conquered Albanact, Doth yield his glory unto Locrine's sword. Mark what ensues, and you may easily see, That all our life is but a Tragedy. Exit. Scena Secunda. Enter Locrine, Guendoline, Corineus, Assaracus, Thrasimachus, Camber. Locrine. And is this true, is Albanactus slain? Hath cursed Humber with his stragling host, With that his army made of mungrel currs, Brought our redoubted brother to his end? O that I had the Thracian Orpheus harp, For to awake out of the infernal shade Those ugly Devils of black Erebus, That might torment the damned traitor's soul: O that I had Amphion's instrument, To quicken with his vital notes and tunes The flintie joynts of every stonie rock, By which the Scythians might be punished; For, by the lightning of almighty Jove, The Hunne shall die had he ten thousand lives: And would to God he had ten thousand lives, That I might with the arm-strong Hercules Crop off so vile an Hydra's hissing heads. But say me, Cousin, for I long to hear How Albanact came by untimely death? Thrasi. After the traiterous host of Scythians Entred the field with martial equipage, Young Albanact impatient of delay, Led forth his army 'gainst the stragling mates, Whose multitude did daunt our souldiers minds, Yet nothing could dismay the forward Prince; But with a courage most heroical, Like to a lion 'mongst a stock of lambs, Made havock of the faint-heart fugitives, Hewing a passage through them with his sword; Yea we had almost given them the repulse, When suddenly from out the silent wood Hubba with twenty thousand souldiers, Cowardly came upon our weakned backs, And murthered all with fatal massacre; Amongst the which old Debon, martial Knight, With many wounds was brought unto the death: And Albanact opprest with multitude, Whilst valiantly he feld his enemies, Yielded his life and honour to the dust, He being dead, the souldiers fled amain, And I alone escaped them by flight, To bring you tidings of these accidents. Locr. Not aged Priam King of stately Troy, Grand Emperour of barbarous Asia, When he beheld his noble minded sonnes Slain troiterously by all the Mirmidons, Lamented more then I for Albanact. Guen. Not Hecuba the Queen of Ilium, When she beheld the town of Pergamus, Her pallace burnt, with all-devouring flames, Her fifty sonnes and daughters fresh of hue, Murthred by the wicked Pyrrhus bloudy sword, Shed such sad tears as I for Albanact. Cam. The grief of Niobe fair Athens Queen, For her seven sonnes magnanimous in field, For her seven daughters fairer then the fairest, Is not to be compar'd with my laments. Cor. In vain you sorrow for the slaughtred Prince, In vain you sorrow for his overthrow; He loves not most that doth lament the most, But he that seeks to venge the injury. Think you to quell the enemies warlike train, With childish sobs and womanish laments? Unsheath your swords, unsheath your conquering sword? And seek revenge, the comfort for this sore: In Cornwall where I hold my regiment, Even just ten thousand valiant men at armes Hath Corineius ready at command: All these and more, if need shall more require, Hath Corineius ready at command. Cam. And in the fields of martial Cambria, Close by the boystrous Iscan's silver streams, Where lightfoot Fairies skip from bank to bank, Full twenty thousand brave couragious Knights Well exercis'd in feats of Chivalrie, In manly manner most invincible, Young Camber hath with gold and victual; All these and more, if need shall more require, I offer up to venge my brothers death. Loc. Thanks loving Uncle, and good Brother too, For this revenge; for this sweet word Revenge Must ease and cease my wrongfull injuries; And by the sword of bloudie Mars I swear, Ne'er shall sweet quiet enter this my front, 'Till I be venged on his traiterous head That slew my noble brother Albanact. Sound drums and trumpets, muster up the camp, For we will straight march to Albania. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Enter Humber, Estrild, Hubba, Trussier, &amp; the souldiers. Hum. Thus are we come victorious Conquerors Unto the flowing currents silver streams, Which, in memorial of our victory, Shall be agnominated by our name, And talked of by our posterity: For sure I hope before the golden Sun Posteth his horses to fair Thetis plains, To see the waters turned into bloud, And change his blewish hue to ruefull red, By reason of the fatal massacre, Which shall be made upon the virent plains. Enter the Ghost of Albanact. See how the Traitor doth presage his harm, See how he glories at his own decay, See how he triumphs at his proper loss. O fortune vild, unstable, fickle, frail! Hum. Me thinks I see both armies in the field, The broken lances climb the crystal skies, Some headless lie, some breathless on the ground, And every place is strew'd with carcasses, Behold the grass hath lost his pleasant green, The sweetest sight that ever might be seen. Ghost. I, traiterous Humber, thou shalt find it so, Yea to thy cost thou shalt the same behold, With anguish, sorrow, and with sad laments; The grassie plains, that now do please thine eyes, Shall e're the night be coloured all with bloud; The shadie groves that now inclose thy camp, And yield sweet savour to thy damned corps, Shall ere the night be figured all with bloud; The profound stream that passeth by thy tents, And with his moisture serveth all thy camp, Shall ere the night converted be to bloud, Yea with the bloud of those thy stragling boyes: For now revenge shall ease my lingring grief, And now revenge shall glut my longing soul. Hub. Let come what will, I mean to bear it out, And either live with glorious victorie, Or die with fame renown'd for chivalrie: He is not worthy of the honey-comb, That shuns the hives because the bees have stings; That likes me best that is not got with ease, Which thousand dangers do accompany; For nothing can dismay our Regal mind; Which aims at nothing but a golden Crown, The only upshot of mine enterprises. Were they inchanted in grim Pluto's Court, And kept for treasure 'mongst his hellish crew, I would either quell the triple Cerberus And all the armie of his hatefull hags, Or roll the stone with wretched Sysiphus. Hum. Right martial be thy thoughts, my noble son, And all thy words savour of Chivalrie, But, warlike Segar, what strange accidents Makes you to leave the warding of the Camp? Segar. To armes, my Lord, to honourable armes; Take helm and targe in hand, the Britains come With greater multitude then erst the Greeks Brought to the ports of Phrygian Tenedos. Hum. But what saith Segar to these accidents? What counsel gives he in extremities? Seg. Why this, my Lord, experience teacheth us, That Resolution is a sole help at need. And this, my Lord, our honour teacheth us, That we be bold in every enterprise; Then since there is no way but fight or die, Be resolute, my Lord, for victory. Hum. And resolute, Segar, I mean to be, Perhaps some blisfull star will favour us, And comfort bring to our perplexed state: Come let us in and fortifie our camp, So to withstand their strong invasion. Exeunt. Scena Quarta. Enter Strumbo, Trumpart, Oliver, and his son William following them. Strum. Nay neighbour Oliver, if you be so whot, come prepare your self, you shall find two as stout fellows of us, as any in all the North. Oliv. No by my dorth neighbour Strumbo, Ich zee dat you are a man of small zideration, dat will zeek to injure your old vreends, one of your vamiliar guests, and derefore zeeing your pinion is to deal withouten reazon, Ich and my zonne William will take dat course, dat shall be fardest vrom reason; how zay you, will you have my Daughter or no? Strum. A very hard question neighbour, but I will solve it as I may: what reason have you to demand it of me? Will. Marry sir, what reason had you when my sister was in the barn to tumble her upon the hay, and to fish her Belly. Strum. Mass thou say'st true; well, but would you have me marry her therefore? No, I scorn her, and you, and you. I, I scorn you all. Oliv. You will not have her then? Strum. No, as I am a true Gentleman. Will. Then will we school you, ere you and we part hence. Enter Margerie, and snatch the staff out of her brothers hand as he is fighting. Strum. I, you come in pudding time, or else I had drest them. Mar. You master sawce-box, lobcock, cocks-comb, you slopsawce, lickfingers, will you not hear? Strum. Who speak you to, me? Mar. I sir, to you, John lackhonestie, littlewit, is it you that will have none of me? Strum. No by my troth, mistress nicebice, how fine you can nick-name me; I think you were brought up in the University of Bridewell, you have your Rhetorick so ready at your tongues end, as if you were never well warned when you were young. Mar. Why then goodman cods-head, if you will have none of me, farewell. Strum. If you be so plain, mistress driggle-draggle, fare you well. Mar. Nay, master Strumbo, ere you go from hence we must have more words, you will have none of me? They both fight. Strum. Oh my head, my head, leave, leave, leave, I will, I will, I will. Mar. Upon that condition I let thee alone. Oliv. How now master Strumbo, hath my daughter taught you a new lesson? Strum. I but hear you, goodman Oliver? it will not be for my ease to have my head broken every day, therefore remedy this, and we shall agree. Oli. Well, Zon, well, for you are my Zon now, all shall be remedied, Daughter be friends with him. Shake hands. Strum. You are a sweet Nut, the Devil crack you. Masters, I think it be my luck, my first wife was a loving quiet wench, but this I think would weary the Devil. I would she might be burnt as my other Wife was; if not, I must run to the Halter for help. O Codpiece, thou hast undone thy Master, this it is to be medling with warm plackets. Exeunt. Scena Quinta. Enter Locrine, Camber, Corineius, Thrasimachus, Assarachus. Loc. Now am I guarded with an hoast of men, Whose haughty courage is invincible; Now am I hemm'd with troups of Souldiers, Such as might force Bellona to retire, And make her tremble at their puissance; Now sit I like the mighty god of warre, When armed with his Coat of Adamant, Mounted his Chariot drawn with mighty Bulls, He drove the Argives over Xanthus streames. Now, cursed Humber, doth thy end draw nigh, Down goes the glory of his victories, And all his fame, and all his high renown, Shall in a moment yield to Locrine's sword: Thy bragging banners crost with argent streames, The ornaments of thy pavillions, Shall all be captivated with this hand, And thou thy self at Albanactus Tombe Shalt offered be, in satisfaction Of all the wrongs thou didst him when he liv'd. But canst thou tell me, brave Thrasimachus, How far we are distant from Humbers camp? Thra. My Lord, within your foule accursed Grove That beares the tokens of our overthrow, This Humber hath intrencht his damned camp. March on, my Lord, because I long to see The treacherous Scythians squeltring in their gore. Locri. Sweet fortune, favour Locrine with a smile, That I may venge my noble Brothers death, And in the midst of stately Troimovant, I'le build a Temple to thy deitie Of perfect marble, and of Jacinth stones, That it shall passe the high Pyramides, Which with their top surmount the firmament. Cam. The arm-strong off-spring of the doubted Knight, Stout Hercules Alcmenas, mighty Son, That tam'd the monsters of the three-fold world, And rid the oppressed from the tyrants yokes, Did never shew such valiantnesse in fight, As I will now for noble Albanact. Cori. Full fourscore yeares hath Corineius liv'd, Sometime in warre, sometime in quiet peace, And yet I feel my self to be as strong As erst I was in summer of mine age, Able to tosse this great unweildy Club, Which hath been painted with my foe-mens brains: And with this Club I'le break the strong array Of Humber and his stragling Souldiers, Or loose my life amongst the thickest presse, And die with honour in my latest dayes: Yet ere I die they all shall understand, What force lies in stout Corineius hand. Thra. And if Thrasimachus detract the fight, Either for weaknesse or for cowardise, Let him not boast that Brutus was his Eame, Or that brave Corineius was his Sire. Loc. Then courage, Souldiers, first for your safety. Next for your peace, last for your victory. Exeunt. Sound the Alarm. Enter Hubba and Segar at one door, and Corineius at the other. Cori. Art thou that Humber, Prince of Fugitives, That by thy treason slew'st young Albanact? Hub. I am his Son that slew young Albanact, And if thou take not heed proud Phrigian, I'le send thy soule unto the Stigian lake, There to complain of Humber's injuries. Cori. You triumph, sir, before the victory, For Corineius is not so soon slain. But, cursed Scythians, you shall rue the day, That e're you came into Albania. So perish they that envy Britains wealth, So let them die with endlesse infamy, And he that seeks his Soveraigns overthrow, Would this my Club might aggravate his woe. Strikes them both down with his Club. Enter Humber. Hum. Where may I find some desart wildernesse, Where I may breathe out curses as I would, And scare the earth with my condemning voyce, Where every ecchoes repercussion May help me to bewaile mine overthrow, And aid me in my sorrowfull laments? Where may I find some hollow uncoth rock, Where I may damn, condemn, and ban my fill? The heavens, the hell, the earth, the aire, the fire, And utter curses to the concave skie, Which may infect the aiery regions, And light upon the Britain Locrine's head. You ugly sprites that in Cocitus mourn, And gnash your teeth with dolorous laments, You fearfull dogs that in black LÃ¦the howle, And scare the Ghosts with your wide open throats, You ugly Ghosts that flying from these dogs, Do plunge your selves in Puryflegiton, Come all of you, and with your shrieking notes Accompany the Britains conquering hoast. Come fierce Erinnis, horrible with Snakes, Come ugly Furies, armed with your whips, You threefold judges of black Tartarus, And all the army of you hellish fiends, With new found torments rack proud Locrine's bones. O gods and starres, damn'd be the gods and starres, That did not drown me in fair Thetis plains. Curst be the sea that with outragious waves, With surging billowes did not rive my ships Against the rocks of high Cerannia, Or swallowed me into her watry gulf. Would God he had arriv'd upon the shore Where Poliphemus and the Cyclops dwell, Or where the bloody Anthropomphagie With greedy jawes devoures the wandring wights, Enter the Ghost of Albanact. But why comes Albanact's bloody Ghost, To bring a corsive to our miseries! Is't not enough to suffer shamefull flight, But we must be tormented now with Ghosts? With apparitions fearfull to behold? Ghost. Revenge, revenge for blood. Hum. So nought will satisfie your wandring Ghost, But dire revenge, nothing but Humber's fall, Because he conquered you in Albany. Now by my soule, Humber would be condemn'd To Tantals hunger, or Ixions Wheele, Or to the vulture of Promotheus, Rather then that this murther were undone. When as I I die I'le drag thy cursed Ghost Through all the Rivers of foule Erebus, Through burning sulphur of the Limbo-lake, To allay the burning fury of that heat, That rageth in mine everlasting soule. Exeunt. Alba. Ghost. Vindicta, vindicta.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Scena Prima. Enter Atey as before. Then Omphale Daughter to the King of Lydia, having a Club in her hand, and a Lyous skin on her back, Hercules following with a distaffe. Then let Omphale turn about, and taking off her Pantofle, strike Hercules on the head, then let them depart, Atey remaining, saying; Quem non Argolici mandata severa Tyranni, Non potuit Juno vincere, vicit amor. Stout Hercules the mirrour of the world, Son to Alcmena and great Jupiter, After so many conquests won in field, After so many Monsters quell'd by force, Yielded his valiant heart to Omphale, A fearfull woman void of manly strength, She took the Club, and wore the Lyons skin. He took the Wheele, and maidenly gan spin So martiall Locrine cheer'd with victory, Falleth in love with Humber's Concubine, And so forgetteth peerlesse Guendoline. His Unckle Corineius stormes at this, And forceth Locrine for his grace to sue, Loe here the summe, the processe doth ensue. Scena Secunda. Enter Locrine, Camber, Corineius, Assarachus, Thrasimachus, and the Souldiers. Loc. Thus from the fury of Bellona's broiles, With sound of Drumme and Trumpets melody, The Britain King returns triumphantly, The Scythians slain with great occision, Doe equallize the grasse in multitude, And with their blood have stain'd the streaming brooks, Offering their bodies and their dearest blood As sacrifice to Albanactus Ghost, Now cursed Humber hast thou paid thy due, For thy deceits and crafty treacheries, For all thy guiles, and damned stratagems, With losse of life, and everduring shame. Where are thy Horses trapt with burnisht gold, Thy trampling Coursers rul'd with foaming bits? Where are thy soldiers strong and numberlesse,? Thy valiant Captains, and thy noble Peers? Even as the Country Clownes with sharpest Scythes, Doe mow the withered grasse from off the earth, Or as the Ploughman with his piercing share Renteth the bowels of the fertile fields, And rippeth up the roots with Razors keen. So Locrine with his mighty curtle-axe, Hath cropped off the heads of all thy Hunnes, So Locrine's Peers have daunted all thy Peeres, And drove thine hoast unto confusion, That thou maist suffer penance for thy fault, And die for murdring valiant Albanact. Cori. And thus, yea thus, shall all the rest be serv'd, That seek to enter Albion 'gainst our wills. If the brave Nation of the Troglodites, If all the Cole-black Ãthiopians, If all the forces of the Amazons, If all the hoasts of the Barbarian lands, Should dare to enter this our little world, Soon should they rue their overbold attempts, That after us our progeny may say, There lie the beasts that sought to usurp our Land. Loc. I, they are beasts that seek to usurp our Land, And like to bruitish beasts they shall be serv'd. For mighty Jove, the supream King of heaven, That guides the concourse of the Meteors, And rules the motion of the azure skie, Fights alwayes for the Britains safety. But stay, me thinks I hear some shrieking noyse, That draweth near to our pavillion. Enter the Souldiers leading in Estrild. Estrild. What Prince soe're adorn'd with golden Crown, Doth sway the Regall Scepter in his hand: And thinks no chance can ever throw him down, Or that his state shall everlasting stand, Let him behold poor Estrild in this plight, The perfect platform of a troubled wight. Once was I guarded with mavortiall bands, Compact with Princes of the noble blood, Now am I faln into my foemens hands, And with my death must pacifie their mood. O life the harbour of calamaties, O death the haven of all miseries, I could compare my sorrows to thy woe, Thou wretched queen of wretched Pergamus, But that thou viewd'st thy enemies overthrow, Nigh to the rock of high Caphareus, Thou saw'st their death, and then departed'st thence. I must abide the victors insolence. The gods that pittied thy continual grief, Transform'd thy corps, and with thy corps thy care, Poor Estrild lives dispairing of relief, For friends in trouble are but few and rare. What said I few? I, few or none at all, For cruel death made havock of them all. Thrice happy they whose fortune was so good, To end their lives, and with their lives their woes, Thrice haplesse I, whom fortune so withstood, That cruelly she gave me to my foes. Oh souldiers is there any misery, To be compar'd to fortunes treacherie. Loc. Camber, this same should be the Scythian Queen. Cam. So may we judge by her lamenting words. Loc. So fair a dame mine eyes did never see, With flouds of woes she seems o're-whelm'd to be. Cam. O Locrine hath she not a cause for to be sad? Locrine at one side of the stage. Loc. If she have cause to weep for Humber's death, And shed salt tears for her overthrow: Locrine may well bewaile his proper grief, Locrine may move his own peculiar woe, He being conquer'd died a speedy death, And felt not long his lamentable smart, I being a conquerour, live a lingring life, And feel the force of Cupid's sudden stroke. I gave him cause to die a speedy death, He left me cause to wish a speedy death. Oh that sweet face painted with natures dye, Those roseal cheeks mixt with a snowy white, That decent neck surpassing ivory, Those comely breasts which Venus well might spite, Are like to snares which wylie fowlers wrought, Wherein my yielding heart is prisoner caught. The golden tresses of her dainty hair Which shine like Rubies glittering with the Sun, Have so entrapt poor Locrine's lovesick heart, That from the same no way it can be won. How true is that which oft I heard declar'd, One dram of joy, must have a pound of care. Estr. Hard is their fall, who from a golden Crown Are cast into a Sea of wretchednesse. Loc. Hard is their thrall, who by Cupid's frown Are wrapt in waves of endlesse carefulnesse. Estr. Oh Kingdome object to all miseries. Loc. Oh love, the extream'st of all extremities. Let him go into his chair. Sold. My Lord, in ransacking the Scythian Tents, I found this Lady, and to manifest That earnest zeal I bear unto your Grace, I here present her to your Majesty. Another sold. He lies, my Lord, I found the Lady first, And here present her to your Majesty. 1. Sold. Presumptuous villain, wilt thou take my prize? 2. Sol. Nay rather thou depriv'st me of my right. 1. Sol. Resigne thy title (cative) unto me, Or with my sword I'le pierce thy cowards loins. 2. Sol. Soft words, good sir, 'tis not enough to speak: A barking dog doth seldome strangers bite. Loc. Unreverent villains, strive you in our sight? Take them hence Jaylor to the dungeon, There let them lie and trie their quarrel out. But thou fair Princesse be no whit dismaid, But rather joy that Locrine favours thee. Estr. How can he favour me that slew my spouse? Loc. The chance of war (my love) took him from thee. Estr. But Locrine was the causer of his death. Loc. He was an enemy to Locrine's state, And slew my noble brother Albanact. Estr. But he was link'd to me in marriage bond, And would you have me love his slaughterer? Loc. Better to live, then not to live at all. Estr. Better to die renowned for chastitie, Then live with shame and endlesse infamie. What would the common sort report of me, If I forget my love, and cleave to thee? Loc. Kings need not fear the vulgar sentences. Estr. But Ladies must regard their honest name. Loc. Is it a shame to live in marriage bonds? Estr. No, but to be a Strumpet to a King. Loc. If thou wilt yield to Locrine's burning love, Thou shalt be Queen of fair Albania. Estr. But Guendoline will undermine my state. Loc. Upon mine Honour, thou shalt have no harme. Est. Then lo brave Locrine, Estrild yields to thee, And by the gods, whom thou do'st invocate, By the dread ghost of thy deceased Sire, By thy right hand, and by thy burning love, Take pitty on poor Estrilds wretched thrall. Cori. Hath Locrine then forgot his Guendoline, That thus he courts the Scythians paramour? What, are the words of Brute so soon forgot? Are my deserts so quickly out of mind? Have I bin faithfull to thy Sire now dead, Have I protected thee from Humber's hands, And do'st thou quit me with ungratitude? Is this the guerdon for my grievous wounds, Is this the honour for my labours past? Now by my sword, Locrine, I swear to thee, This injury of thine shall be repaid. Loc. Uncle, scorn you your royal soveraigne, As if we stood for cyphers in the Court? Upbraid you me with those your benefits? Why, it was a subjects duty so to do. What you have done for our deceased Sire, We know, and all know, you have your reward. Cori. Avant proud princox, brav'st thou me withall, Assure thy self, though thou be Emperour Thou ne're shalt carry this unpunished. Cam. Pardon my brother, noble Corineus, Pardon this once, and it shall be amended. Assar. Cousin, remember Brutus latest words, How he desired you to cherish them: Let not this fault so much incense your mind, Which is not yet passed all remedy. Cori. Then Locrine, loe I reconcile my self, But as thou lov'st thy life, so love thy wife: But if thou violate those promises, Bloud and revenge shall light upon thy head. Come, let us back to stately Troynovant, Where all these matters shall be setled. Locrine to himself. Millions of devils wait upon thy soul. Legions of spirits vex thy impious ghost: Ten thousand torments rack thy cursed bones. Let every thing that hath the use of breath, Be instruments and workers of thy death. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Enter Humber alone, his hair hanging over his shoulders, his arms all bloudie, and a dart in one hand. Hum. What Basilisk hath hatched in this place, Where every thing consumed is to nought? What fearfull Furie haunts these cursed groves, Where not a root is left for Humber's meat? Hath fell Alecto with envenomed blasts, Breathed forth poison in these tender plains? Hath triple Cerberus with contagious foam, Sow'd Aconitum 'mongst these withered hearbs? Hath dreadfull Fames with her charming rods Brought barrennesse on every fruitfull tree? What not a root, no fruit, no beast, no bird, To nourish Humber in this wildernesse? What would you more, you fiends of Erebus? My very intrails burn for want of drink, My bowels cry, Humber give us some meat, But wretched Humber can give you no meat, These foul accursed groves afford no meat: This fruitless soil, this ground brings forth no meat. The gods, hard hearted gods, yield me no meat. Then how can Humber give you any meat? Enter Strumbo with a pitch-fork, and a Scotch-cap. St. How do you, Masters, how do you? how have you scaped hanging this long time? ifaith I have scapt many a scouring this year, but I thank God I have past them all with a good couragio, couragio, and my wife and I are in great love and charity now, I thank my manhood and my strength; for I will tell you, Masters, upon a certain day at night I came home, to say the very truth, with my stomack full of wine, and ran up into the chamber, where my wife soberly sate rocking my little babie, leaning her back against the bed, singing lullaby. Now when she saw me come with my nose formost, thinking that I had been drunk, as I was indeed, snatcht up a fagot-stick in her hand, and came furiously marching towards me with a big face, as though she would have eaten me at a bit; thundering out these words unto me. Thou drunken knave where hast thou been so long? I shall teach thee how to benight me another time: and so she began to play knaves trumps. Now although I trembled fearing she would set her ten commandements in my face, ran within her, and taking her lustily by the middle, I carried her valiantly to the bed, and flinging her upon it, flung my self upon her, and there I delighted her so with the sport I made, that ever after she would call me sweet husband, and so banisht brawling for ever: and to see the good will of the wench, she bought with her Portion a yard of land, and by that I am now become one of the richest men in our parish. Well, Masters, what's a clock? it is now break-fast time, you shall see what meat I have here for my break-fast. He sits down and pulls out his victuals. Hum. Was ever land so fruitless as this land? Was ever grove so gracelesse as this grove? Was ever soil so barren as this soil? Oh no: the land where hungry Fames dwelt, May no wise equalize this cursed land; No, even the climate of the torrid zone Brings forth more fruit then this accursed grove. Ne'er came sweet Ceres, ne'er came Venus here; Triptolemus the god of husbandmen, Ne'er sow'd his seed in this foul wildernesse. The hunger-bitten dogs of Acheron, Chac't from the nine-fold Puriflegiton, Have set their footsteps in this damned ground. The iron-hearted Furies arm'd with snakes, Scatered huge Hydra's over all the plains, Which have consum'd the grass, the herbs, the trees, Which have drunk up the flowing water springs. Strumbo hearing his voice starts up, and puts his meat in his pocket, seeking to hide himself. Hum. Thou great commande of the starry sky, That guid'st the life of every mortal wight, From the inclosures of the fleeting clouds Rain down some food, or else I faint and dye: Pour down some drink, or else I faint and dye. O Jupiter, hast thou sent Mercury In clownish shape to minister some food? Some meat, some meat, some meat. Strum. O alas sir, ye are deceived, I am not Mercury, I am Strumbo. Hum. Give me some meat, villain, give me some meat, Or 'gainst this rock, I'le dash thy cursed brains, And rend thy bowels with my bloudie hands. Give me some meat, villain, give me some meat. Strum. By the faith of my body, good fellow, I had rather give an whole oxe, then that thou should'st serve me in that sort. Dash out my brains? O horrible, terrible. I think I have a quarry of stones in my pocket. He makes as though he would give him some, and as he putteth out his hand, enter the Ghost of Albanact, and strikes him on the hand, and so Strumbo runs out, Humber following him. Exeunt. Alba. Ghost. Loe here the gift of fell ambition, Of usurpation and of treachery. Loe here the harms that wait upon all those That do intrude themselves in others lands, Which are not under their dominion. Exit. Scena Quarta. Enter Locrine alone. Loc. Seven yeares hath aged Corineus liv'd To Locrine's grief, and fair Estrilda's woe, And seven yeares more he hopeth yet to live; Oh supreme Jove, annihilate this thought. Should he enjoy the aires fruition? Should he enjoy the benefit of life? Should he contemplate the radiant sun, That makes my life equall to dreadfull death? Venus convey this monster fro the earth, That disobeyeth thus thy sacred hests. Cupid convey this monster to dark hell, That disannulls thy mothers sugred lawes. Mars with thy target all beset with flames, With murthering blade bereave him of his life, That hindreth Locrine in his sweetest joyes. And yet for all his diligent aspect, His wrathfull eyes piercing like Linces eyes, Well have I overmatcht his subtiltie. Nigh Deucolitum by the pleasant Lee, Where brackish Thamis slides with silver streams, Making a breach into the grassie downes, A curious arch of costly marble fraught, Hath Locrine framed underneath the ground, The walls whereof, garnisht with diamonds, With ophirs, rubies, glistering emeralds, And interlac't with sun-bright carbuncles, Lightens the room with artificial day, And from the Lee with water-flowing pipes The moisture is deriv'd into this arch, Where I have plac'd fair Estrild secretly; Thither eftsoons accompanied with my page, I covertly visit my hearts desire, Without suspition of the meanest eye, For love aboundeth still with policie: And thither still means Locrine to repair, Till Atropos cut off mine uncle's life. Exit. Scena Quinta. Enter Humber alone, saying: Hum. O vita misero longa, fÅlici brevis! Eheu malorum fames extremum malum. Long have I lived in this desart cave, With eating hawes and miserable roots, Devouring leaves and beastly excrements. Caves were my beds, and stones my pillow-beres, Fear was my sleep, and horrour was my dream; For still me thought at every boisterous blast, Now Locrine comes, now Humber thou must dye; So that for fear and hunger, Humber's mind Can never rest, but alwayes trembling stands. O what Danubius now may quench my thirst? What Euphrates, what light-foot Euripus May now allay the fury of that heat, Which raging in my entrails eats me up? You ghastly devils of the ninefold Styx, You damned ghosts of joyless Acheron, You mournfull soules, vext in Abyssus vaults, You coal-black devils of Avernus pond, Come with your flesh-hooks, rend my famisht armes, These armes that have sustain'd their masters life; Come with your razours rip my bowels up, With your sharp fire-forks crack my starved bones. Use me as you will, so Humber may not live. Accursed gods that rule the starrie poles, Accursed Jove king of the accursed gods, Cast down your lightning on poor Humber's head, That I may leave this deathfull like life of mine: What hear you not, and shall not Humber dye? Nay I will dye though all the gods say nay. And gentle Aby take my troubled corps, Take it and keep it from all mortal eyes, That none may say when I have lost my breath, The very flouds conspir'd 'gainst Humber's death. Flings himself into the river. Enter the Ghost of Albanact. En cÃ¦dem sequitur, cÃ¦des in cÃ¦de quiesco. Humber is dead, joy heavens, leap earth, dance trees; Now may'st thou reach thy apples Tantalus, And withem feed thy hunger-bitten limmes: Now Sysiphus leave the tumbling of thy rock, And rest thy restless bones upon the same; Unbind Ixion, cruel Rhadamanth, And lay proud Humber on the whirling wheel. Back will I post to hell mouth TÃ¦narus, And pass Cocytus, to the Elysian fields, And tell my father Brutus of these newes. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Scena Prima. Enter Ate as before. Jason leading Creon's daughter. Medea following, hath a garland in her hand, and putting it on Creon's daughters head, setteth it on fire, and then killing Jason and her, departeth. Ate. Non tam Trinacriis exÃ¦stuat Ãtna cavernis, LÃ¦sÃ¦ furtivo quam cor mulieris amore. Medea seeing Jason leave her love, And choose the daughter of the Theban King, Went to her devillish charms to work revenge; And raising up the triple Hecate, With all the rout of the condemned fiends, Framed a garland by her magick skill, With which she wrought Jason and Creon's ill. So Guendoline seeing her self misus'd, And Humber's paramour possesse her place, Flies to the Dukedome of Cornubia, And with her brother stout Thrasimachus, Gathering a power of Cornish souldiers, Gives battel to her husband and his host, Nigh to the river of great Mertia: The chances of this dismal massacre, That which ensueth shortly will unfold. Exit. Scena Secunda. Enter Locrine, Camber, Assaracus, Thrasimachas. Assa. But tell me, Cousin, dyed my Brother so? Now who is left to hapless Albion, That as a pillar might uphold our state, That might strike terrour to our daring foes? Now who is left to hapless Britanie, That might defend her from the barbarous hands Of those that still desire her ruinous fall, And seek to work her downfall and decay. Cam. I Uncle, death is our common enemy, And none but death can match our matchlesse power, Witnesse the fall of Albioneus crew, Witnesse the fall of Humber and his Hunnes, And this foul death hath now increas'd our woe, By taking Corineus from this life, And in his room leaving us worlds of care. Thra. But none may more bewaile his mournfull hearse, Then I that am the issue of his loins, Now foul befall that cursed Humber's throat, That was the causer of his lingring wound. Loc. Tears cannot raise him from the dead again, But where's my Lady Mistris Guendoline? Thra. In Cornwall, Locrine, is my sister now, Providing for my Father's funeral. Loc. And let her there provide her mourning weeds, And mourn for ever her own widdow-hood: Ne're shall she come within our Palace gate, To countercheck brave Locrine in his love. Go, boy, to Deucolitum, down the Lee, Unto the arch where lovely Estrild lies, Bring her and Sabren straight unto the Court, She shall be Queen in Guendolinaes room. Let others waile for Corineus death, I mean not so to macerate my mind, For him that barr'd me from my hearts desire. Thra. Hath Locrine then forsook his Guendoline? Is Corineus death so soon forgot? If there be gods in heaven, as sure there be, If there be fiends in hell, as needs there must, They will revenge this thy notorious wrong, Ande pour their plagues upon thy cursed head. Loc. What, prat'st thou, pesant, to thy Soveraigne? Or art thou strucken in some extasie? Do'st thou not tremble at our royal looks? Do'st thou not quake when mighty Locrine frowns? Thou beardlesse boy, were't not that Locrine scorns To vex his mind with such a heartlesse child, With the sharp point of this my battel-axe, I'de send thy soul to Puryflegiton. Thra. Though I be young and of a tender age, Yet will I cope with Locrine when he dares. My noble father with his conquering sword, Slew the two gyants Kings of Aquitain. Thrasimachus is not so degenerate, That he should fear and tremble at the looks Or taunting words of a venerian squire. Loc. Menacest thou thy royal Soveraign? Ucivil, not beseeming such as you. Injurious traitor (for he is no lesse That at defiance standeth with his King) Leave these thy taunts, leave these thy bragging words, Unlesse thou mean'st to leave thy wretched life. Thra. If Princes stain their glorious dignitie With ugly spots of monstrous infamie, They leese their former estimation, And throw themselves into a hell of hate. Loc. Wilt thou abuse my gentle patience, As though thou did'st our high displeasure scorne? Proud boy, that thou mast know thy Prince is mov'd, Yea, greatly mov'd at this thy swelling pride, We banish thee for ever from our Court. Thra. Then, losell Locrine, look unto thy self, Thrasimachus will venge this injurie. Exit. Loc. Farewell, proud boy, and learn to use thy tongue. Assa. Alas, my Lord, you should have call'd to mind The latest words that Brutus spake to you, How he desir'd you, by the obedience That children ought to bear their sire, To love and favour Lady Guendoline: Consider this, that if the injurie Do move her mind, as certainly it will, War and dissention follows speedily. What though her power be not so great as yours, Have you not seen a mighty Elephant Slain by the biting of a silly Mouse? Even so the chance of war inconstant is. Loc. Peace Uncle, peace, and cease to talk hereof, For he that seeks by whispering this or that, To trouble Locrine in his sweetest life, Let him perswade himself to die the death. Enter the Page, with Estrild and Sabren. Estr. O say me, Page? tell me, where is the King? Wherefore doth he send for me to the Court? Is it to die? is it to end my life? Say me, sweet boy? tell me and do not fain. Page. No, trust me, Madam, if you will credit the little honestie that is yet left me, there is no such danger as you fear, but prepare your self, yonder's the King. Estr. Then, Estrild, lift thy dazled spirits up, And blesse that blessed time, that day, that hour, That warlike Locrine first did favour thee. Peace to the King of Britany, my Love, Peace to all those that love and favour him. Locrine taking her up. Doth Estrild fall with such submission Before her servant King of Albion? Arise, fair Lady, leave this lowly chear, Lift up those looks that cherish Locrine's heart, That I may freely view that roseal face, Which so intangled hath my love-sick brest. Now to the Court, where we will court it out, And passe the night and day in Venus sports. Frollick, brave Peers, be joyfull with your King. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Enter Guendoline, Thrasimachus, Madan, and souldiers. Guen. You gentle winds that with your modest blasts, Passe through the circuit of the heavenly vault, Enter the clouds unto the throne of Jove, And bear my prayers to his all-hearing ears, For Locrine hath forsaken Guendoline, And learnt to love proud Humbers concubine. You happy sprites that in the concave skie With pleasant joy, enjoy your sweetest love, Shed forth those tears with me, which then you shed, When first you woo'd your Ladies to your wills: Those tears are fittest for my wofull case, Since Locrine shuns my nothing pleasant face. Blush Heavens, blush Sun, and hide thy shining beams, Shadow thy radiant locks in gloomy clouds, Deny thy cheerfull light unto the world, Where nothing reigns but falshood and deceit. What said I, falshood? I, that filthy crime, For Locrine hath forsaken Guendoline. Behold the heavens do wail for Guendoline: The shining sun doth blush for Guendoline: The liquid air doth weep for Guendoline: The very ground doth groan for Guendoline. I, they are milder then the Britain King, For he rejecteth luckless Guendoline. Thra. Sister, complaints are bootless in this cause, This open wrong must have an open plague: This plague must be repaid with grievous war, This war must finish with Locrinus death, His death will soon extinguish our complaints. Guen. O no, his death will more augment my woes, He was my husband, brave Thrasimacus, More dear to me then the apple of mine eye, Nor can I find in heart to work his scathe. Thra. Madam, if not your proper injuries, Nor my exile, can move you to revenge: Think on our father Corineus words, His words to us stand alwayes for a Law. Should Locrine live that caus'd my fathers death? Should Locrine live that now divorceth you? The heavens, the earth, the air, the fire reclaims; And then why should all we deny the same? Guen. Then henceforth farewell womanish complaints, All childish pitty henceforth then farewell: But cursed Locrine look unto thy self, For Nemesis the mistresse of Revenge, Sits arm'd at all points on our dismal blades, And cursed Estrild that inflam'd his heart, Shall if I live, die a reproachfull death. Madan. Mother, though nature makes me to lament My luckless fathers froward lechery; Yet for he wrongs my Lady mother, thus, I, if I could, my self would work his death. Thra. See Madam, see, the desire of revenge Is in the children of a tender age. Forward, brave souldiers, into Mertia, Where we shall brave the coward to his face. Exeunt. Scena Quarta. Enter Locrine, Estrild, Habren, Assarachus, and the Souldiers. Locr. Tell me, Assaracus, are the Cornish chuffes In such great number come to Mertia, And have they pitched there their host, So close unto our Royal mansion? Assa. They are, my Lord, and mean incontinent To bid defiance to your Majesty. Locr. It makes me laugh, to think that Guendoline Should have the heart to come in armes 'gainst me. Estr. Alas, my Lord, the horse will run amain When as the spur doth gall him to the bone; Jealousie, Locrine, hath a wicked sting. Locr. Sayst thou so, Estrild, Beauties paragon? Well, we will try her choler to the proof, And make her know, Locrine can brook no braves. March on, Assarachus, thou must lead the way, And bring us to their proud pavillion. Exeunt. Scena Quinta. Enter the Ghost of Corineus, with thunder &amp; lightning. Ghost. Behold, the circuit of the azure sky Throws forth sad throbs, and grievous suspirs, Prejudicating Locrine's overthrow: The fire casteth forth sharp darts of flames, The great foundation of the triple world Trembleth and quaketh with a mighty noise, Presaging bloudy massacres at hand. The wandring birds that flutter in the dark, When hellish night in cloudie chariot seated, Casteth her mists on shadie Tellus face, With sable mantles covering all the earth, Now flies abroad amid the cheerfull day, Foretelling some unwonted misery. The snarling curres of darkned Tartarus, Sent from Avernus ponds by Radamanth, With howling ditties pester every wood; The watrie Ladies and the lightfoot Fawns, And all the rabble of the woodie Nymphs, All trembling hide themselves in shadie groves, And shrowd themselves in hideous hollow pits. The boysterous Boreas thundreth forth revenge: The stonie rocks cry out on sharp revenge: The thornie bush pronounceth dire revenge. Sound the alarme. Now Corineus stay and see revenge, And feed thy soul with Locrine's overthrow, Behold they come, the Trumpets call them forth: The roaring drumms summon the souldiers. Loe where their army glistereth on the plains. Throw forth thy lightning, mighty Jupiter, And pour thy plagues on cursed Locrine's head. Stand aside. Enter Locrine, Estrild, Assaracus, Habren and their souldiers at one door, Thrasimachus, Guendoline, Madan and their followers at another. Loc. What is the Tygre started from his cave? Is Guendoline come from Cornubia, That thus she braveth Locrine to the teeth? And hast thou found thine armour, pretty boy, Accompanied with these thy stragling mates? Believe me but this enterprise was bold, And well deserveth commendation. Guen. I Locrine, trairerous Locrine, we are come, With full pretence to seek thine overthrow: What have I done that thou should'st scorn me thus? What have I said that thou should'st me reject? Have I been disobedient to thy words? Have I bewray'd thy arcane secrecie? Have I dishonoured thy marriage bed With filthy crimes, or with lascivious lusts? Nay it is thou that hast dishonoured it, Thy filthy mind orecome with filthy lusts, Yieldeth unto affections filthy darts. Unkind, thou wrong'st thy first and truest feer, Unkind, thou wrong'st thy best and dearest friend; Unkind, thou scorn'st all skilfull Brutus lawes, Forgetting father, uncle, and thy self. Estr. Believe me Locrine, but the girle is wise, And well would seem to make a vestal Nun, How finely frames she her oration. Thra. Locrine we came not here to fight with words, Words that can never win the victory, But for you are so merry in your frumps, Unsheath your swords, and trie it out by force, That we may see who hath the better hand. Locr. Think'st thou to dare me, bold Thrasimacus? Think'st thou to fear me with thy taunting braves, Or do we seem too weak to cope with thee? Soon shall I shew thee my fine cutting blade, And with my sword, the messenger of death, Seal thee an acquittance for thy bold attempts. Exeunt. Sound the alarum. Enter Locrine, Assaracus, and a souldier at one door, Guendoline, Thrasimacus, at an other, Locrine and his followers driven back. Then let Locrine and Estrild enter again in a maze. Locr. O fair Estrilda, we have lost the field, Thrasimachus hath won the victory, And we are left to be a laughing stock, Scoft at by those that are our enemies, Ten thousand souldiers arm'd with sword and shield, Prevail against an hundred thousand men, Thrasimachus incest with fuming ire, Rageth among'st the faint-heart souldiers Like to grim Mars, when covered with his targe He fought with Diomedes in the field, Close by the banks of silver Simois, Sound the alarum. O lovely Estrild now the chase begins, Ne're shall we see the stately Troynovant Mounted with coursers garnisht all with pearles Ne're shall we view the fair Concordia, Unlesse as captives we be thither brought. Shall Locrine then be taken prisoner, By such a youngling as Thrasimachus? Shall Guendoline captivate my love? Ne're shall mine eyes behold that dismal hour, Ne're will I view that ruthfull spectacle, For with my sword, this sharp curtle axe, I'le cut in sunder my accursed heart. But O you judges of the ninefold Stix, Which with incessant torments rack the ghosts Within the bottomlesse Abyssus pits, You gods, commanders of the heavenly spheers, Whose will and laws irrevocable stands, Forgive, forgive, this foul accursed sin, Forget O gods, this foul condemned fault: And now my sword that in so many fights kiss his sword. Hast sav'd the life of Brutus and his son, End now his life that wisheth still for death, Work now his death that wisheth still for death, Work now his death that hateth still his life. Farewell fair Estrild, beauties paragon, Fram'd in the front of forlorn miseries, Ne're shall mine eyes behold thy sun-shine eyes, But when we meet in the Elysian fields, Thither I go before with hastened pace. Farewell vain world, and thy inticing snares. Farewell foul sin, and thy inticing pleasures. And welcome death, the end of mortal smart, Welcome to Locrine's over-burthened heart. Thrusts himself through with his sword. Estr. Break heart with sobs and grievous suspirs, Stream forth you tears from forth my watry eyes, Help me to mourn for warlike Locrine's death, Pour down your tears you watry regions, For mighty Locrine is bereft of life. O fickle fortune, O unstable world, What else are all things, that this globe contains, But a confused chaos of mishaps? Wherein as in a glasse we plainly see, That all our life is but a Tragedie. Since mighty Kings are subject to mishap, I, mighty Kings are subject to mishap, Since martial Locrine is bereft of life, Shall Estrild live then after Locrine's death? Shall love of life bar her from Locrine's sword? O no, this sword that hath bereft his life, Shall now deprive me of my fleeting soul: Strengthen these hands O mighty Jupiter, That I may end my wofull miserie, Locrine I come, Locrine I follow thee. Kills her self. Sound the alarme. Enter Sabren. Sab. What dolefull sight, what ruthfull spectacle Hath fortune offred to my haplesse heart? My father slain with such a fatal sword, My mother murthred by a mortal wound? What Thracian dog, what barbarous Mirmidon, Would not relent at such a ruthfull case? What fierce Achilles, what hard stony flint, Would not bemone this mournfull Tragedie? Locrine, the map of magnanimitie, Lies slaughtered in his foul accursed cave, Estrild, the perfect pattern of renown, Natures sole wonder, in whose beauteous brests, All heavenly grace and vertue was inshrind, Both massacred are dead within this cave, And with them dies fair Pallas and sweet love. Here lies a sword, and Sabren hath a heart, This blessed sword shall cut my cursed heart, And bring my soul unto my parents ghosts, That they that live and view our Tragedy, May mourn our case with mournfull plaudities. Let her offer to kill her self. Ay me, my virgins hands are too too weak, To penetrate the bullwarke of my brest, My fingers us'd to tune the amorous Lute, Are not of force to hold this steely glain, So I am left to waile my parents death, Not able for to work my proper death. Ah Locrine, honour'd for thy noblenesse. Ah Estrild, famous for thy constancie. Ill may they fare that wrought your mortal ends. Enter Guendoline, Thrasimachus, Madan, and the Souldiers. Guen. Search souldiers search, find Locrine &amp; his Love, Find the proud strumpet, Humber's concubine, That I may change those her so pleasing looks, To pale and ignominious aspect. Find me the issue of their cursed love, Find me young Sabren, Locrine's only joy, That I may glut my mind with lukewarme bloud, Swiftly distilling from the bastards brest, My fathers ghost still hants me for revenge, Crying, revenge my over-hastened death, My brother's exile, and mine own divorce, Banish remorse clean from my brazen heart, All mercy from mine adamantive brests. Thra. Nor doth thy husband, lovely Guendoline, That wonted was to guide our stailesse steps, Enjoy this light; see where he murdred lies: By lucklesse lot and froward frowning fate, And by him lies his lovely paramour Fair Estrild goared with a dismal sword, And as it seems, both murdred by themselves, Clasping each other in their feebled armes, With loving zeal, as if for company Their uncontented corps were yet content To passe foul Stix in Charon's ferry-boat. Guen. And hath proud Estrild then prevented me, Hath she escaped Guendolina's wrath, Violently by cutting off her life? Would God she had the monstrous Hidra's lives, That every hour she might have died a death Worse then the swing of old Ixions wheel, And every hour revive to die again, As Titius bound to housles Caucason, Doth feed the substance of his own mishap, And every day for want of food doth die, And every night doth live again to die. But stay, me thinks I hear some fainting voice, Mournfully weeping for their lucklesse death. Sa. You mountain nimphs which in these desarts raign, Cease off your hasty chase of savage beasts, Prepare to see a heart opprest with care, Addresse your ears to hear a mournfull stile, No humane strength, no work can work my weal, Care in my heart so tyrant like doth deal. You Driades and lightfoot Satiri, You gracious Fairies which at evening tide, Your closets leave with heavenly beauty stor'd, And on your shoulders spread your golden locks, You savage bears in Caves and darkned Denns, Come wail with me the martial Locrine's death. Come mourn with me, for beateous Estrilds death. Ah loving parents little do you know, What sorrow Sabren suffers for your thrall. Guen. But may this be, and is it possible, Lives Sabren yet to expiate my wrath? Fortune I thank thee for this curtesie, And let me never see one prosperous hour, If Sabren die not a reproachfull death. Sa. Hard hearted death, that when the wretched call. Art farthest off, and seldome hear'st at all. But in the mid'st of fortunes good successe, Uncalled comes, and sheers our life in twain: When will that hour, that blessed hour draw nigh, When poor distressed Sabren may be gone. Sweet Atropos cut off my fatal thred. What art thou death, shall not poor Sabren die? Guendoline taking her by the chin, shall say thus. Guen. Yes damsel, yes, Sabren shall surely die, Though all the world should seek to save her life, And not a common death shall Sabren die, But after strange and grievous punishments, Shortly inflicted upon thy bastards head, Thou shalt be cast into the cursed streams, And feed the fishes with thy tender flesh. Sab. And think'st thou then, thou cruel homicid, That these thy deeds shall be unpunished? No traitor, no, the gods will venge these wrongs, The fiends of hell will mark these injuries. Never shall these bloud-sucking masty currs, Bring wretched Sabren to her latest home. For I my self in spite of thee and thine, Mean to abridge my former destinies, And that which Locrine's sword could not perform, This present streame shall present bring to passe. She drowneth her self. Guen. One michief follows anothers neck, Who would have thought so young a maid as she With such a courage would have sought her death. And for because this River was the place Where little Sabren resolutely died, Sabren for ever shall this same be call'd. And as for Locrine our deceased spouse, Because he was the son of mighty Brute, To whom we owe our country, lives and goods, He shall be buried in a stately tombe, Close by his aged father Brutus bones, With such great pomp and great solemnity, As well beseems so b ave a Prince as he. Let Estrild lie without the shallow vaults, Without the honour due unto the dead, Because she was the authour of this War. Retire brave followers unto Troynovant, Where we will celebrate these exequies, And place young Locrine in his father's Tombe. Exeunt omnes. Atey. Lo here the end of lawlesse treachery, Of Usurpation and ambitious pride, And they that for their private amours dare Turmoile our land, and set their broils abroach, Let them be warned by these premisses, And as a woman was the onely cause That civil discord was then stirred up, So let us pray for that renowned maid, That eight and thirty years the Scepter sway'd In quiet peace and sweet felicitie, And every wight that seeks her graces smart, Would that this sword were pierced in his heart. Exit. FINIS.</field>
