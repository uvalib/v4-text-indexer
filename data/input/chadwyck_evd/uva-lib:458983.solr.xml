      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Since tis become the Title of our Play, A woman once in a Coronation may With pardon, speake the Prologue, give as free A welcome to the Theater, as he That with a little beard, a long blacke cloke, With a starch'd face, and supple legge hath spoke Before the Playes the twelve month, let me then Present a welcome to these Gentlemen, If you be kind, and noble, you will not Thinke the worse of me for my petticote. But to the Play, the Poet bad me tell His feares first in the title, lest it swell Some thoughts with expectation of a straine, That but once could be seene in a Kings raigne, This Coronation, he hopes you may See often, while the genious of his Play, Doth prophesie the Conduites may runne wine, When the dayes triumph's ended, and divine Briske Nectar swell his temples to a rage, With something of more price to invest the stage. There rests but to prepare you, that although It be a Coronation, there doth flow No undermirth, such as doth lar'd the scene For course delight, the language here is cleare. And confident our Poet bad me say, Heele bate you but the folly of a Play. For which although dull soules his pen dispise, Who thinkes it yet too carely to be wise. The nobler will thanke his muse, at least Excuse him, cause his thought aym'd at the best, But we conclude not, it dost rest in you. To censure Poet, Play, and Prologue too. But what have J omitted? is there not A blush upon my cheekes that I forgot The Ladies, and a Female Prologue too? Your pardon noble Gentlewomen, you Were first within my thoughts, J know you sit As free, and high Commissioners of wit, Have cleare, and active soules, nay though the men Were lost in your eyes, they'l be found agen, You are the bright intelligences move, And make a harmony this sphere of Love, Be you propitious then, our Poet sayes, Our wreath from you, is worth their grove of Bayes:</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus. 1. Enter Philocles and Lisander. Phi. Make way for my Lord Protector. Lisa. Your graces servants. Enter Cassander and Lisimachus. Cas. I like your diligent waiting, where's Lisimachus? Lisi. I waite upon you sir. Cas. The Queene lookes pleasant This morning, does she not? Lis. I ever found Her gracious smiles on me. Cas. She does consult Her safety in't, for I must tell thee boy, But in the assurance of her love to thee, I should advance thy hopes another way, And use the power I have in Epire, to Settle our owne, and uncontrouled greatnesse; But since she carries her selfe so fairely, I am content to expect, and by her marriage Secure thy fortune, that's all my ambition Now, be still carefull in thy applications To her, I must attend other affaires, Returne, and use what art thou canst to lay More charmes of love upon her. Lisi. I presume Shee alwayes speakes the language of her heart, And I can be ambitious for no more Happinesse on earth then she encourages Me to expect. Cas. It was an act becomming The wisedome of her Father to engage A tye betweene our families, and she Hath playd her best discretion to allow it; But we lose time in conference, waite on her, And be what thou wert borne for, King of Epire, I must away. Exit. Lisi. Successe ever attend you. Is not the Queene yet comming forth? Lisa. Your servant, You may command our duties, This is the Court starre Philocles. Phi. The starre that we must saile by. Lisa. All must borrow A light from him, the young Queene directs all Her favours that way. Phi. Hees a noble Gentleman And worthy of his expectations: Too good to be the son of such a Father. Lisa. Peace, remember he is Lord Protector. Phil. We have more need of Heavens protection I'th meane time, I wonder the old King Did in his life designe him for the office. Lisa. He might suspect his faith, I have heard when The King who was no Epirote advanc'd His claime, Cassander, our Protector now, Young then, oppos'd him toughly with his faction, But forc'd to yeeld had faire conditions, And was declar'd by the whole state next heire If the King wanted issue; our hopes only Thriv'd in this daughter. Phi. Whom but for her smiles And hope of marriage with Lisimachus, His Father by some cunning had remov'd Ere this. Lisa. Take heed, the Arras may have eares I should not weepe much if his grace would hence Remove to Heaven. Phi. I prethee what should he do there? Lisa. Some Offices will fall. Phi. And the sky too, ere I get one staire higher While hees in place. Enter Antigonus. Ant. Lisander, Philocles, How lookes the day upon us? where's the Queene? Phi. In her bed-chamber. Ant. Who was with her? Lisa. None but the yong Lord Lisimachus. Ant. Tis no treason If a man wish himselfe a Courtier Of such a possibility: he has The mounting fate. Phi. I would his Father were Mounted toth' gallowes. Ant. He has a path faire enough, If he survive by title of his Father. Lisa. The Queene will hasten his ascent. Phi. Would I wore Queene. Ant. Thou wod'st become rarely the peticote, What wod'st thou doe? Phi. Why, I wod marry My Gentleman usher, and trust all the strength And burden of my state upon his legges, Rather then be call'd wife by any sonne Of such a Father. Lisa. Come lets leave this subject, We may finde more secure discourse; when saw You young Arcadius, Lord Macarius Nephew? Ant. Theres a sparke, a youth moulded for a favorite, The Queene might doe him honour. Phi. Favorite, tis too cheape a name, there were a match Now for her Virgin blood. Lisa. Must every man That has a hansome face or legge feed such Ambition: I confesse I honour him, He has a nimble soule, and gives great hope To be no woman-hater, dances hansomely, Can court a Lady powerfully, but more goes Toth' making of a Prince? hees here Ands Vncle. Enter Arcadius, Macarius, Seleucus. Sel. Save you Gentlemen, who can direct me To finde my Lord Protector? Lisa. He was here Within this halfe houre, young Lisimachus His sonne is with the Queene. Sel. There let him complement, I have other businesse, ha? Arcadius! Exit. Phi. Observ'd you with what eyes Arcadius And he saluted, their two families Will hardly reconcile. Ant. Seleucus carries Himselfe too roughly, with what pride and scorne He past by em. Lisa. The tother with lesse shew Of anger carries pride enough in's soule, I wish em all at peace, Macarius lookes Are without civill warre, a good old man, The old King lov'd him well, Seleucus Father Was as deare to him, and maintain'd the character Of an honest Lord through Epire: that two men So lov'd of others, should be so unwell-come To one another. Arc. The Queene was not wont to send for me. Mac. The reason's to her selfe, It will become your duty to attend her. Arc. Save you Gentlemen, what novelty Does the Court breath to day? Lisa. None sir, the newes That tooke the last impression is, that you Purpose to leave the Kingdome, and those men, That honour you, take no delight to heare it. Arc. I have ambition to see the difference Of Courts, and this may spare; the delights At home doe surfet, and the mistresse whom We all doe serve is fixt upon one object, Her beames are too much pointed, but no Country Shall make me lose your memories. Enter Queene, Lisimachus, Macarius, Charilla. Que. Arcadius. Mac. Your Lordship honord me, I have no blessing in his absence. Lisi. Tis done like a pious Vncle. Que. We must not Give any licence. Arc. If your Majesty Would please. Que. We are not pleasd, it had become your duty, To have first acquainted us, ere you declar'd Your resolution publicke, is our Court Not worth your stay? Arc. I humbly begge your pardon. Que. Where's Lisimachus? Lisi. Your humble servant Madam. Que. We shall finde Employment at home for you, doe not lose us. Arc. Madam I then write my selfe blest on earth When I may doe you service. Que. We would be private Macarius. Mac. Madam you have blest me, Nothing but your command could interpose to Stay him. Que. Lisimachus You must not leave us. Lisa. Nothing but Lisimachus? has she not. Taine a philter? Exit. Que. Nay pray be cover'd, Ceremony from you, Must be excus'd. Lisi. It will become my duty. Que. Not your love! I know you would not have me looke upon Your person as a Courtier, not as favorite, That title were too narrow to expresse How we esteeme you. Lisi. The least of all These names from you Madam, is grace enough. Que. Yet here you wod not rest. Lisi. Not if you please? To say there is a happinesse beyond, And teach my ambition how to make it mine, Although the honours you already have Let fall upon your servant, exceed all My merit; I have a heart is studious To reach it with desert, and make if possible Your favours mine by justice, with your pardon. Que. We are confident this needs no pardon sir, But a reward to cherish your opinion, And that you may keepe warme your passion, Know we resolve for marriage, and if I had another gift, beside my selfe, Greater, in that you should discerne, how much My heart is fixt. Lisi. Let me digest my blessing. Que. But I cannot resolve when this shall be, Lisi. How Madam? doe not make me dreame of Heaven And wake me into misery, if your purpose Be, to immortalize your humble servant, Your power on earth's divine, Princes are here The Coppies of eternity, and create When they but will our happinesse. Que. I shall Beleeve you mocke me in this argument, I have no power. Lisi. How no power. Que. Not as a Queene. Lisi. I understand you not. Que. I must obey, your Fathers my Protector. Lisi. How? Que. When I am absolute, Lisimachus, Our power and titles meete, before, we are but A shadow, and to give you that were nothing, Lisi. Excellent Queene, My love tooke no originall from state, Or the desire of other greatnesse, Above what my birth may challenge modestly, I love your vertues; mercenary soules Are taken with advancement, yo've an Empire Within you, better then the worlds, to that Lookes my ambition. Que. Tother is not fit To be despisd, Cosmography allowes Epire a place ith' mappe, and know till I Possesse what I was borne to, and alone Doe graspe the Kingdomes Scepter, I account My selfe divided, he that marries me Shall take an absolute Queene to his warme bosome, My temples yet are naked, untill then Our loves can be but complements, and wishes, Yet very hearty ones. Lisi. I apprehend. Que. Your Father. Enter Cassander, Seleucus. Cas. Madam, a Gentleman has an humble sure, Que. Tis in your power to grant, you are Protector, I am not yet a Queene. Cas. Hows this? Lisi. I shall expound her meaning. Queene. Why kneele you sir? Sel. Madam to reconcile two families That may unite, both counsells and their blood To serve your Crowne. Que. Macarius, and Eubulus That by are inveterate malice to each other. It grew, as I have heard upon the question Which some of either family had made, Which of their Fathers was the best commander: If we beleeve our stories, they have both Deserved well of our state, and yet this quarrell Has cost too many lives, a severe faction. Sel. But Ile propound a way to plant a quiet And peace in both our houses, which are torne With their dissentions, and lose the glory Of their great names, my blood speakes my relation To Eubulus, and I wish my veines were emptyed To appease their warre. Que. Thou hast a noble soule, This is a charity above thy youth, And it flowes bravely from thee, name the way. Sel. In such a desperate cause, a little streame Of blood might purge the foulenesse of their hearts If youle prevent a deluge. Que. Be particular. Sel. Let but your Majesty consent, that two May with their personall valour undertake The honour of their family, and determine Their difference. Que. This rather will inlarge Their hate, and be a meanes to call more blood Into the streame. Sel. Not if both families Agree, and sweareâ Que. And who shall be the Champions. Sel. I beg the honour, for Eubulus cause To be ingag'd, if any for Macarius, Worthy to wager heart with mine, accept it, I am confident, Arcadius For honour would direct me to his sword, Will not deny, to stake against my life His owne, if you vouchsafe us priviledge. Que. You are the expectation and toppe boughs Of both your houses, it would seeme injustice. To allow a civill warre to cut you off, And your selves the instruments, besides You appeare a souldier, Arcadius Hath no acquaintance yet with rugged warre, More fit to drill a Lady then expose His body to such dangers: a small wound Ith' head may spoyle the method of his haire, Whose curiosity exacts more time Than his devotion, and who knowes but he May lose his riban by it in his locke, Deare as his Saint, with whom he would exchange His head, for her gay colours; then his band May be disorderd, and transform'd from Lace To Cutworke, his rich cloathes be discomplexioned With blood, beside the infashionable slashes, And at the next festivall take physicke, Or put on blacke, and mourne for his slaine breeches: His hands cas'd up in gloves all night, and sweate Pomatum, the next day may be endanger'd To blisters with a sword, how can he stand Vpon his guard, who hath fidlers in his head, To which, his feet must ever be a dancing. Beside a falsify may spoyle his cringe, Or making of a legge, in which consists Much of his Court perfection. Sel. Is this Character Bestow'd on him? Que. It something may concerne the Gentleman, Whom if you please to challenge To dance, play on the Lute, or sing. Sel. Some catch? Que. He shall not want those will maintaine him For any summe. Sel. You are my Soveraigne, I dare not thinke, yet I must speake somewhat, I shall burst else, I have no skill in jigges, Nor tumbling. Que. How sir? Sel. Nor was I borne a Minstrell, and in this you have So infinitely disgraced Arcadius, But that I have heard another Character, And with your royall licence doe beleeve it, I should not thinke him worth my killing, Que. Your killing? Sel. Does she not jeere mee; I shall talke treason presently, I finde it At my tongues end already, this is an Affront, Ile leave her. Que. Come backe, doe you know Arcadius? Sel. I ha changd but little breath with him, our persons Admit no familiarity, we were Borne to live both at distance, yet I ha seene him Fight, and fight bravely. Que.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Arcadius, and Polidora. Pol. Indeed you shall not goe. Arc. Whether? Pol. To travell, I know you see me, but to take your leave, But I must never yeeld to such an absence. Arc. I prethee leave thy feares, I am commanded To th'contrary, I wo not leave thee now. Pol. Commanded? by whom? Arc. The Queene. Pol. I am very glad, for trust me, I could thinke Of thy departure with no comfort, thou Art all the joy I have, halfe of my soule; But I must thanke the Queene now for thy company, I prethee what could make thee so desirous To be abroad? Arc. Onely to get an appetite To thee Polidora. Pol. Then you must provoke it. Arc. Nay, prethee doe not so mistake thy servant. Pol. Perhaps you surfeit with my love. Arc. Thy love? Pol. Although I have no beauty to compare With the best faces, I have a heart above All competition. Arc. Thou art jealous now, Come, let me take the kisse I gave thee last, I am so confident of thee, no lippe Has ravisht it from thine; I prethee come To Court. Pol. For what? Arc. There is the throne for beauty. Pol. Tis safer dwelling here. Arc, Theres none will hurt, Or dare but thinke an ill to Polidora, The greatest will be proud to honour thee. Thy luster wants the admiration here: There thou wot shine indeed, and strike a reverence Into the gazer. Pol. You can flatter too. Arc. No praise of thee can be thought so, thy vertue Will deserve all, I must confesse, we Courtiers Doe oftentimes commend to shew our art, There is necessity sometimes to say, This Madam breaths Arabian Gummes, Amber and Cassia; though while we are praysing, We wish we had no nostriles to take in The offensive steame of her corrupted lungs. Nay, some will sweare they love their Mistresse, Would hazard lives and fortunes, to preserve One of her haires brighter then Berinices; Or young Apollos, and yet after this, A favour from another toy would tempt him To laugh, while the Officious hangman whips Her head off. Pol. Fine men. Arc. I am none of these, Nay, there are women Polidora too That can doe pretty well at flatteries; Make men beleeve they dote, will languish for em, Can kisse a Iewell out of one, and dally A carcanet of Diamonds from another, Weepe into th'bosome of a third, and make Him drop as many pearles; they count it nothing To talke a reasonable heire within ten dayes Out of his whole estate, and make him mad He has no more wealth to consume. Pol. Youle teach me To thinke I may be flattered in your promises, Since you live where this art is most profest. Arc. I dare not be so wicked Polidora, The Infant errors of the Court I may Be guilty off, but never to abuse So rare a goodnesse, nor indeed did ever Converse with any of those shames of Court, To practise for base ends; be confident My heart is full of thine, and I so deepely Carry the figure of my Polidora, It is not in the power of time or distance To cancell it, by all thats blest I love thee: Love thee above all women, dare invoke A curse when I forsake thee. Pol. Let it be some Gentle one. Arc. Teach me an oath I prethee, One strong enough to binde, if thou dost finde Any suspition of my faith, or else Direct me in some horrid imprecation When I forsake thee, for the love of other Woman, may heaven reward my apostacy To blast my greatest happinesse on earth, And make all joyes abortive. Pol. Revoke these hasty syllables, they carry To great a penalty for breach of Love To me, I am not worth thy suffering, You doe not know what beauty may invite Your change, what happinesse may tempt your eye And heart together. Arc. Should all the graces of your sex conspire In one, and she should court me, with a dower Able to buy a Kingdome when I give My heart from Polidora. Pol. I suspect not, And to requite thy constancy I sweare. Arc. Twere sinne to let thee waste thy breath I have assurance of thy noble thoughts. Enter a servant. Ser. My Lord, your Vncle hath beene every where Ith Court inquiring for you, his lookes speake Some earnest cause. Arc. I am more acquainted with Thy vertue then to imagine thou wilt not Excuse me now, one kisse dismisses him Whose heart shall waite on Polidora, prethee Let me not wish for thy returne too often, My Father. Enter Nestorius, and a servant. Nes. I met Arcadius in strange haste, he told me He had beene with thee. Pol. Some affaire too soone Ravish'd him hence, his Vncle sent for him You came now from Court: how lookes the Queene This golden morning? Nes. Like a bride, her soule Is all on mirth, her eyes have quickning fires, Able to strike a spring into the earth In Winter. Pol. Then Lisimachus can have No frost in's blood, that lives so neere her beames. Nes. His politicke Father, the Protector smiles too, Resolve to see the Cerimony of the Queene Twill be a day of state, Pol. I am not well. Nes. How not well? retire then, I must returne My attendance is expected, Polidora, Be carefull of thy health. Pol. It will concerne me. Exit. Enter Arcadius, and Macarius. Arc. You amaze me sir. Mac. Deare Nephew, if thou respect thy safety, My honour, or my age, remove thy selfe, Thy lifes in danger. Arc. Mine? who's my enemy? Mac. Take horse, and instantly forsake the City, Or else within some unsuspected dwelling, Obscure thy selfe, stay not to know the reason. Arc. Sir, I beseech your pardon, which ith number Of my offences unto any, should Provoke this dishonorable flight? Mac. I would when I petition'd for thy stay, I had pleaded for thy banishment, thou knowst not What threatens thee: Arc. I would desire to know it, I am in no conspiracy of treason, Have ravisht no mans Mistresse, not so much As given the lye to any what should meane Your strange and violent feares, I will not stirre Vntill you make me sensible I have lost My innocence. Mac. I must not live to see Thy body full of wounds, it were lesse sinne To rippe thy Fathers marble, and fetch from The reverend vault his ashes, and disperse them By some rude windes where none should ever find The sacred dust, it was his legacy, The breath he mingled with his prayers to Heaven I should preserve Arcadius, whose fate He prophesied in death, would need protection, Thou wot disturbe his ghost, and call it to Affright my dreames, if thou refuse to obey me. Arc. You more inflame me to inquire the cause Of your distraction, and youle arme me better Then any coward flight by acquainting me Whose malice aimes to kill me, good sir tell me, Mac. Then prayers and teares assist me. Arc. Sir. Mac. Arcadius, Thou art a rash young man, witnesse the spirit Of him that trusted me so much, I bleed, Till I prevent this mischiefe. Exit. Enter Philocles, Lisander. Arc. Ha, keepe off. Phi. What meane you sir? Lisa. We are your friends. Arc. I know your faces, but Am not secure, I would not be betray'd. Lisa. You wrong our hearts, who truely honour you. Arc. They say I must be kild. Phi. By whom? Arc. I know not, nor wod I part with life so tamely. Phi. We dare ingage ours in your quarrell, hide Your sword, it may beget suspition, It's enough to question you. Arc. I am confident, Pray pardon me, come I despise all danger: Yet a deare friend of mine, my Vncle told me He would not see my body full of wounds. Lisa. Your Vncle! this is strange. Arc. Yes, my honest Vncle, If my unlucky starres have pointed me So dire a fate. Phi. There is some strange mistake in't. Enter Antigonus. Ant. Arcadius, the Queene would speake with you, You must make haste. Arc. Though to my death, I fly Vpon her summons, I give up my breath Then willingly, if she command it from me. Phi. This does a little trouble me. Lisa. I know not What to imagine, something is the ground Of this perplexity, but I hope there is not Any such danger as he apprehends. Enter Queene, Lisimachus, Macarius, Eubulus, Seleucus, Arcadius, Ladies and attendants, Gent. Que. We have already granted to Seleucus And they shall try their valour if Arcadius Have spirit in him to accept the challenge, Our royall word is past. Phi. This is strange. Eub. Madam my sonne knew not what he asked, And you were cruell to consent so soone. Mac. Wherein have I offended, to be rob'd At once of all the wealth I have, Arcadius Is part of me. Eub. Seleucus life and mine Are twisted on one thread, both stand or fall Together, hath the service for my Country Deserved but this reward, to be sent weeping To my eternall home? Wast not enough When I was young, to lose my blood in warres, But the poore remnant that is scarcely warme And faintly creeping through my withered veines Must be let out to make you sport. Mac. How can We that shall this morne see the sacred oyle Fall on your virgin tresses, hope for any Protection hereafter, when this day You sacrifice the blood of them that pray for you. Arcadius I prethee speake thy selfe, It is for thee I plead. Eub. Seleucus, kneele And say thou haste repented thy rash suite; If ere I see thee fight, I be thus wounded, How will the least drop forc'd from thy veines, Afflict my heart. Mac. Why, that's good; Arcadius speake to her; heare him Madam. Arc. If you call backe this honour you have done me I shall repent I live, doe not perswade me Seleucus thou art a noble enemy, And I will love thy soule though I dispaire Our bodies friendly conversation: I would we were to tugge upon some cliffe, Or like two prodigies ith ayre, our conflict Might generally be gaz'd at, and our blood Appease our grandsires ashes. Mac. I am undone. Sel. Madam, my father sayes I have offended, If so, I begge your pardon, but beseech you For your owne glory call not backe your word. Eub. They are both mad. Que. No more, we have resolv'd, And since their courage is so nobly flamed, This morning weele behold the Champions Within the list, be not affraid, their strife Will stretch so farre as death, so soone as we Are Crown'd prepare your selves, Seleucus. kisses her hand.

I am circled with confusions Ile doe somewhat My braines and friends assist me. Exit. Phi. But doe you thinke theyle fight indeed? Lisa. Perhaps Her Majesty will see about or two. And yet tis wondrous strange, such spectacles Are rare ith' Court, and they were to skirmish naked Before her, then there might be some excuse. There is some gimcrackes in't, the Queene is wise Above her yeares. Phi. Macarius is perplext. Enter Eubulus. Lisa. I cannot blame him, but my Lord Eubulus Returnes, they are both troubled, las good men, But our duties are expected, we forget. Exit Phil, Lis. Eub. I must resolve, and yet things are not ripe, My braines upon the torture. Mac. This may quit The hazard of his person, whose least drop Of blood is worth more then our families. My Lord Eubulus, I have thought a way To stay the young mens desperate proceedings, It is our cause they fight, let us beseech The Queene, to grant us two the priviledge Of duell, rather then expose their lives To eithers fury; it were pitty they Should runne upon so blacke a destiny, We are both old, and may be spar'd, a paire Of fruitlesse trees, mossie and withered trunckes, That fill up too much roome. Eub. Most willingly, And I will praise her charity to allow it; I have not yet forgot to use a sword, Lets lose no time, by this act, she will licence Our soules to leave our bodies but a day, Perhaps an houre the sooner; they may live To doe her better service, and be friends When we are dead, and yet I have no hope This will be granted, curse upon our faction. Mac. If she deny usâ Eub. What? Mac. I wod doe somewhatâ Eub. There's something oth' suddaine strucke upon My imagination, that may secure us. Mac. Name it, if no dishonour waite upon't To preserve them, Ile accept any danger. Eub. There is no other way, and yet my heart Would be excus'd but tis to save his life. Mac. Speake it Eubulus. Eub. In your eare I shall, It shanot make a noyse if you refuse it. Mac. Hum? though it stirre my blood, Ile meet Arcadius, If this preserve thee not, I must unseale Another mystery. Exit. Enter Queene, Lisimachus, Cassander, Charilla, Lisander, Philocles, Antigonus. Que. We owe to all your loves and will deserve At least by our indeavours that none may This day repent their prayers, my Lord Protector. Cas. Madam I have no Such title now, and am blest to lose That name so happily, I was but trusted With a glorious burden. Que. You have prov'd Your selfe our faithfull counsellor, and must still Protect our growing state, a Kingdomes Scepter Weighs downe a womans arme, this crowne sits heavy Vpon my brow already, and we know There's something more then mettle in this wreath, Of shining glory, but your faith, and counsell, That are familiar with mysteries, And depths of state, have power to make us fit For such a bearing, in which both you shall Doe loyall service, and reward your duties. Cas. Heaven preserve your Highnesse. Que. But yet my Lords and Gentlemen let none Mistake me, that because I urge your wisdomes, I shall grow carelesse, and impose on you The managing of this great Province, no, We will be active too, and as we are In dignity above your persons, so, The greatest portion of the difficulties We call to us, you in your severall places Releeving us with your experience, Observing in your best directions All modesty, and distance, for although We are but young, no action shall forfeit Our royall priviledge, or encourage any Too unreverent boldnesse, as it will become Our honour to consult, ere we determine Of the most necessary things of state, So we are sensible of a checke, But in a brow, that saucily controules Our action, presuming on our yeares As few, or frailty of our sex, that head Is not secure that dares our power or justice. Phi. She has a brave spirit, looke how the Protector Growes pale already. Que. But I speake to you Are perfect in obedience, and may spare This theame, yet 'twas no immateriall Part of our character, since I desire All should take notice, I have studied The knowledge of my selfe, by which I shall Better distinguish of your worth and persons In your relations to us. Lisa. This language Is but a threatning to some body Que. But we misse some, that use not to absent Their duties from us, where's Macarius? Cas. Retir'd to grieve, your Majesty hath given; Consent Arcadius should enter List To day with young Seleucus. Que. We purpose. Enter Gentleman They shall proceed, whats he? Phil. A Gentleman belonging to Seleucus, that gives notice He is prepar'd, and waites your royall pleasure, Que. He was composd for action, give notice To Arcadius, and admit the challenger, Let other Princes boast their gaudy tilting, And mockery of battles, but our triumph Is celebrated with true noble vallour. Enter Selucus, Arcadius at severall doores, their pages before them bearing their Targets. Two young men spirited enough to have Two Kingdomes staked upon their swords, Lisimachus Doe not they excellently become their armes, Twere pitty but they should doe something more Then wave their plumes. a shout within. What noyse is that? Enter Macarius and Eubulus. Mac. The peoples joy to know us reconcild, Is added to the Iubile of the day, We have no more a faction but one heart, Peace flow in every bosome. Eub. Throw away These instruments of death, and like two friends Imbrace by our example. Que. This unfain'd? Mac. By our duties to your selfe deare Madam Command them not advance, our houses from This minute are incorporated, happy day Our eyes at which before revenge looke forth, May cleare suspition, oh my Arcadius! Eub. We have found a neerer way to friendship Madam, Then by exposing them to fight for us. Que. If this be faithfull our desires are blest, We had no thought to waste, but reconcile Your blood this was, and we did prophesie This happy chance, spring into eithers bosome, Arcadius and Seleucus, what can now Be added to this dayes felicity; Yes, there is something, is there not my Lord? While we are Virgin Queene. Ca. Ha, that string Doth promise musicke. Que. I am yet my Lords Your single joy, and when I looke upon, What I have tooke, to manage the great care Of this most flowrishing Kingdome, I incline To thinke, I shall doe justice to my selfe, If I chose one, whose strength and vertue may Assist my undertaking, thinke you Lords, A husband would not helpe? Lisa. No question Madam, And he that you purpose to make so blest Must needs be worthy of our humblest duty, It is the generall vote. Que.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Enter Polidora, and a Servant. Pol. Oh where shall Virgins looke for faith hereafter? If he prove false, after so many vowes? And yet if I consider, he was tempted Above the strength of a young Lover, two Such glorious courting his acceptance, were Able to make disloyalty no sinne, At least not seeme a fault, a Lady first, Whose very lookes would thaw a man more frozen Then the Alps, quicken a soule more dead then Winter. Adde to her beauty and perfection, That she's a Queene, and brings with her a Kingdome Able to make a great mind forfeit heaven. What could the frailety of Arcadius Suggest to unspirit him so much, as not To fly to her embraces, you were present When she declar'd her selfe. Ser. Yes Madam. Pol. Tell me, Did not he make a pause, when the faire Queene A full temptation stood him? Ser. Very little My judgement could distinguish, she did no sooner Propound, but he accepted. Pol. That was ill, He might with honour stand one or two minutes, Me thinkes it should have startled him a little, To have rememberd me, I have deserv'd At least a cold thought, well pray give it him. Ser. I shall. Pol. When? Ser. Instantly. Pol. Not so, But take a time when his joy swels him most, When his delights are high and ravishing, When you perceive his soule dance in his eyes, When she that must be his, hath drest her beauty With all her pride, and sends a thousand Cupids To call him to the tasting of her lippe; Then give him this, and tell him while I live, Ile pray for him.

Cas. Have you ambition To be a tame foole? see so vast an injury And not revenge it? make me not suspect Thy Mother for this sufferance, my Sonne. Lisi. Pray heare me sir. Cas. Heare a patient gull, A property, thou hast no blood of mine, If this affront provoke thee not, how canst Be charitable to thy selfe, and let him live To glory in thy shame?

How many Lovers are in Epire now Would throw themselves on danger, not expect One enemy, but empty their owne veines, And thinke the losse of all their blood rewarded, To have one smile of us when they are dying? And shall this murmure shake you? Arc. Not deare Madam, My life is such a poore despised thing, In value your least graces, that To lose it were to make my selfe a victory, It is not for my selfe I feare: the envy Of others cannot fasten wound in me Greater, then that your goodnesse should be check'd So daringly. Que. Let not those thoughts afflict thee While we have power to correct the offences Arcadius be mine, this shall confirme it. Arc. I shall forget And lose my way to heaven, that touch had beene Enough to have restor'd me, and infused A spirit of a more celestiall nature, After the tedious absence of my soule, Oh blesse me not too much, one smile a day Would stretch my life to mortality, Poets that wrap divinity in tales, Looke here, and give your coppyes forth of angels, What blessing can remaine? Que. Our Marryage. Arc. Place then some horrors in the way For me, not you to passe, the journeys end Holds out such glories to me, I should thinke Hell but a poore degree of suffering for it, Whats that some petition, a Letter to me. You had a Polidora, ha, thats all. Ith' minute when my vessels new lanch'd forth, With all my pride and silken winges about me I strike upon a Rocke: what power can save me? You had a Polidora; theres a name Kil'd with griefe I can so soone forget her Ser. She did impose on me this service sir, And while she lives she sayes sheele pray for you. Aarc. Shee lives Thats well, and yet twere better, for my fame, And honour she were dead, what fate hath plac'd me Vpon this fearefull precipise? Ser. Hees troubled. Arc. I must resolve, my faith is violated Already, yet poore loving Polidora Will pray for me, she sayes, to thinke she can Render me hated to my selfe, and every Thought's a tormentor, let me then be just. Que. Arcadius. Arc. That voyce prevailes agen, oh Poledora, Thou must forgive Arcadius, I dare not Turne rebell to a Princesse, I shall love Thy vertue, but a Kingdome has a charme To excuse our frailty, dearest Madam.

Bis. Not I sir, but I am commanded by oath, And conscience to speake truth. Arc. If your truth should doe me any harme, I shall never Be in charity with a Croziers staffe, looke too't. Que. My youngest Brother, Cas. Worse and worse, my braines. Exit. Mac. Deliver to me an Infant with this writing, To which this reverend Father is a witnesse. Lisa. This he whom we so long thought dead, a childe. Que. But what should make my father to trust him To your concealement? give abroad his death, and bury An empty coffin? Mac. A jealousie he had Vpon Cassander, whose ambitious braine He fear'd would make no conscience to depose His sonne, to make Lisimachus King of Epire. Que. He made no scruple to expose me then To any danger? Mac. He secur'd you Madam By an earely engagement of your affection To Lisimachus, exempt this testimony, Had he beene Arcadius, and my Nephew I needed not obtrude him on the state, Your Love and marriage had made him King Without my trouble, and sav'd that ambition There was necessity to open now His birth, and title. Phi. Demetrius alive. Arc. What riddles are these, whom do they talk of? Omn. Congratulate your returne to life, and honor, And as becomes us, with one voyce salute you Demetrius King of Epire. Mac. I am no Vncle, sir, this is your sister, I should have suffered incest to have kept you Longer ith' darke, love, and be happy both, My trust is now discharg'd. Lisa. And we rejoyce. Arc. But doe not mocke me Gentlemen, May I be bold upon your words to say I am Prince Thedosius sonne. Mac. The King. Arc. Youle justifie it? Sister I am very glad to see you. Sop. I am to finde a brother, and resigne my glory, My triumph is my shame. Exit. Enter Cassander. Cas. Thine eare Lisimachus. Arc. Gentlemen I owe Vnto your loves, as large acknowledgement As to my birth for this great honour, and My study shall be equall to be thought Worthy of both. Cas. Thou art turn'd Marble. Lisi.

Yet stay, tis too much pride to send for her, Weele goe our selfe, no honour is enough For Polidora, to redeeme our fault Salute her gently from me, and upon Your knee, present her with this Diademe, Tis our first gift, tell her Demetrius followes To be her guest, and give himselfe a servant To her chaste bosome, bid her stretch her heart To meet me, I am lost in joy and wonder.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Cassander, Eubulus, Souldier. Cas. VVheres the Captaine of the Castle? Sol. Heele attend your honours presently. Cas. Give him knowledge we expect him. Sol. I shall my Lord. Exit. Cas. He is my creature, feare not, And shall runne any course that we propound. Eub. My Lord, I like the substance of your plot, Tis promising, but matters of this consequence Are not so easily perfect, and it does Concerne our heads to build upon secure Principles, though Seleucus, I confesse, Carry a high, and daring spirit in him, Tis hard to thrust upon the state new setled Any impostor, and we know not yet Whether heele undertake to play the Prince; Or if he should accept it, with what cunning He can behave himselfe. Cas. My Lord, affaires Of such a glorious nature, are halfe finish'd When they beginne with confidence. Fub. Admit He want no art, nor courage, it must rest Vpon the people to receive his title, And with what danger their uncertaine breath May flatter ours, Demetrius scarcely warme In the Kings seate, I may suspect. Cas. That reason Makes for our part, for if it be so probable, That young Demetrius should be living, why May not we worke them to beleeve Leonatus The eldest sonne was by some tricke preserv'd And now would clame his owne: there were two sons, Who in their Fathers life we supposed dead, May not we finde a circumstance to make This seeme as cleare as t'other, let the vulgar Be once possest, weele carry Epire from Demetrius, and the world. Eub. I could be pleasd To see my sonne a King. Enter Poleanus. The Captaines here. Pol. I waite your Lordships pleasure. Cas. We come to visit your late prisoner, I will not doubt, but you intreate him fairely. He will deserve it for himselfe, and you Be fortunate in any occasion To have exprest your service. Pol. Sir, the knowledge Of my honourable Lord his Father, will Instruct me to behave my selfe with all Respects becomming me, to such a sonne. Cas. These things will least Obleige you, but how beares he his restraint? Pol. As one whose soule's above it. Eub. Patiently? Pol. With contempt rather of the great command Which made him prisoner, he will talke sometimes So strangely to himselfe. Eub. Hee's here. Enter Seleucus. Sel. Why was I borne to be a subject? 'tis Soone answer'd, sure my Father was no Prince, Thats all, the same ingredience use to make A man, as active, though not royall blood Went to my composition, and I Was gotten with as good a will perhaps, And my birth cost my mother as much sorrow, As I had beene borne an Emperour. Cas. While I looke Vpon him, something in his face presents A King indeed. Eub. He does resemble much Thedosius too. Cas. Whose sonne we would pretend him, This will advance our plot, Sel. Tis but a name, And meere opinion, that preferres one man Above another, Ile imagine then I am a Prince, or some brave thing on earth, And see what followes, but it must not be My single voyce will carry it, the name Of King must be attended with a troope Of acclamations, on whose ayrie wings He mounts, and once exalted threatens Heaven, And all the starres: how to acquire this noyse, And be the thing I talke of, men have rise From a more cheape nobility to Empires, From darke originalls, and sordid blood, Nay some that had no fathers, sons of the earth, And flying people, have aspir'd to Kingdomes, Made nations tremble, any have practis'd frownes To awe the world, their memory is glorious, And I would hugge them in their shades, but whats All this to me, that am I know not what, And lesse in expectation? Pol. Are you serious? Cas. Will you assist, and runne a fate with us. Pol. Command my life, I owe it to your favour. Sel. Arcadius was once as farre from being As I, and had we not so cunningly Beene reconcil'd, or one, or both had gone To seeke our fortunes in another world; What's the device now? If my death be next, The summons shall not make me once looke pale. Cas. Chide your too vaine suspitions, we bring A life, and liberty, with what else can make Thy ambition happie, th'ast a glorious flame We come to advance it. Sel. How? Cas. Have but a will, And be what thy owne thoughts dare prompt thee to, A King. Sel. You doe not mocke me Gentlemen, You are my father sir. Eub. This minute shall Declare it my Seleucus, our hearts swel'd With joy, with duty rather, oh my boy! Sel. What's the mistery? Pol. You must be a King. Cas. Seleucus, stay thou art too incredulous, Let not our faith, and studdy to exalt thee, Be so rewarded. Eub. I pronounce thee King Vnlesse thy spirit be turn'd coward, and Thou faint to accept it. Sel. King of what? Cas. Of Epire. Sel. Although the Queen since she sent me hither Were gone to Heaven I know not how That title could devolve to me. Cas. We have No Queene, since he that should have marryed her, Is prov'd her youngest brother, and now King In his owne title. Sel. Thanke you Gentlemen, There's hope for me. Cas. Why, you dare fight with him And need be, for the Kingdome. Sel. With Arcadius, If youle make stakes, my life against his crowne, Ile fight with him, and you, and your fine sonne, And all the Courtiers one after another. Cas. 'T wonot come to that. Sel. I am of your Lordships minde, so fare you well Cas. Yet stay and heare Sel. What? that you have betraide me, Doe, tell your King, my life is growne a burden, And Ile confesse, and make your soules looke pale, To see how nimble mine shall leape this battlement Of flesh, and dying, laugh at your poore malice. Omnes. No more, long, live Leonatus King of Epire. Sel. Leonatus, who's that? Cas. Be bold and be a King, our braines have beene Working to raise you to this height, here are None but friends, dare you but call your selfe Leonatus, and but justifie with confidence What weele proclaime you, if we doe not bring The Crowne to your head, we will forfeit ours. Eub. The state is in distraction, Arcadius Is prov'd a King, there was an elder brother, If you dare but pronounce, you are the same, Forget you are my sonne. Pol. These are no trifles, sir, all is plotted To assure your greatnesse, if you will be wise, And take the faire occasion that's presented. Sel. Arcadius, you say, is lawfull King, And now to depose him, you would make me An elder brother, is't not so? Cas. Most right. Sel. Nay, right or wrong, if this be your true meaning. Omnes. Vpon our lives. Sel. Ile venture mine, but with your pardon, Whose braine was this? from whom tooke this plot life? Eub. My Lord Cassander. Sel. And you are of his minde? and you? and thinke This may be done? Eub. The destinies shall not crosse us, if you have Spirit to undertake it. Sel. Vndertake it? I am not us'd to complement, Ile owe My life to you, my fortunes to your Lordship, Compose me as you please, and when y'ave made Me what you promise, you shall both divide Me equally, one word my Lord, I had rather Live in the prison still, then be a propency To advance his politicke ends. Eub. Have no suspition. Cas. So, so, I see Demetrius heeles already Trip'd up, and Ile dispatch him out oth' way, Which gone, I can depose this at my leasure Being an Impostor, then my sonne stands faire, And may peece with the Princesse, we lose time, What thinke you, if we first surprize the Court, While you command the Castle, we shall curbe All opposition. Eub. Let's proclaime him first. I have some faction, the people love me, They gain'd to us, weele fall upon the Court. Cas. Vnlesse Demetrius yeeld himselfe he bleeds. Sel. Who dares call treason sinne, when it succeeds? Exeunt Omnes Enter Sophia and Charilla. Cha. Madam, you are too passionate, and lose The greatnesse of your soule, with the expence Of too much griefe, for that which providence Hath eas'd you of, the burden of a state Above your tender bearing. Sop. Thar't a foole, And canst not reach the spirit of a Lady, Borne great as I was, and made onely lesse By a too cruell destiny, above Our tender bearing? what goes richer to The composition of man, then ours? Our soule as free, and spacious, our heart's As great, our will as large, each thought as active, And in this onely man more proud then wee, That would have us lesse capable of Empire, But search the stories, and the name of Queene Shines bright with glory, and some precedents Above mans imitation. Cha. I grant it For the honour of our sex, nor have you, Madam, By any weakenesse forfeited command, He that succeeds, in justice, was before you, And you have gain'd more in a royall brother Then you could lose by your resigne of Epire. Sop. This I allow Charilla, I ha done; Tis not the thought I am deposd afflicts me, At the same time I feele a joy to know My Brother living: no, there is another Wound in me above cure. Cha. Vertue forbid. Sop. Canst finde me out a Surgeon for that? Cha. For what? Sop. My bleeding fame. Cha. Oh doe not injure Your owne cleare innocence. Sop. Doe not flatter me, I have beene guilty of an act, will make All love in women questioned, is not that A blot upon a Virgins name? my birth Cannot extenuate my shame, I am Become the staine of Epire. Cha. Tis but Your owne opinon, Madam, which presents Something to fright your selfe, which cannot Be in the same shape so horrid to our sense. Sop. Thou wod'st but canst not appeare ignorant, Did not the Court, nay, the whole Kingdome, take Notice I lov'd Lisimachus? Cha. True Madam. Sop. No. I was false Though counseld by my Father to affect him, I had my politicke ends upon Cassander, To be absolute Queene, flattering his son with hopes Of love and marriage, when that very day I blush to thinke I wrong'd Lisimachus, That noble Gentleman, but heaven punish'd me; For though to know Demetrius was a blessing, Yet who will not impute it my dishonour. Cha. Madam, you yet may recompence Lisimachus, If you affect him now, you were not false To him whom then you lov'd not, if you can Finde any gentle passion in your soule To entertaine his thought, no doubt his heart, Though sad, retaines a noble will to meet it, His love was firme to you, and cannot be Vnrooted with one storme. Sop. He will not sure Trust any language from her tongue that mock'd him, Although my soule doth weepe for't, and is punish'd To love him above the world. Enter Lisimachus. Cha. Hees here As fate would have him reconcild, be free, And speake your thoughts. Lisi. If Madam I appeare Too bold, your charity will signe my pardon: I heard you were not well, which made me haste To pay the duty of an humble visite. Sop. You doe not mocke me sir. Lisi. I am confident You thinke me not so lost to manners, in The knowledge of your person, to bring with me Such rudenesse, I have nothing to present, But a heart full of wishes for your health, And what else may be added to your happinesse. Sop. I thought you had beene sensible. Lisi. How Madam? Sop. A man of understanding, can you spend One prayer for me, remembring the dishonour I have done Lisimachus? Lisi. Nothing can deface that part of my Religion in me, not to pray for you. Sop. It is not then impossible you may Forgive me too, indeed I have a soule Is full of penitence, and something else, If blushing would allow to give't a name. Lisi. What Madam? Sop. Love, a love that should redeeme My past offence, and make me white againe. Lisi. I hope no sadnesse can possesse your thoughts For me, I am not worthy of this sorrow, But if you meane it any satisfaction For what your will hath made me suffer, 'tis But a strange overflow of charity, To keepe me still alive, be your selfe Madam, And let no cause of mine, be guilty of This rape upon your eyes, my name's not worth The least of all your teares. Sop. You thinke em counterfeit. Lisi. Although I may Suspect a womans smile hereafter, yet I would beleeve their wet eyes, and if this Be what you promise, for my sake, I have But one reply. Sop. I waite it. Lisi. I have now Another Mistresse. Sop. Stay. Lisi. To whom I have made Since your revolt from me, a new chaste vow, Which not the second malice of my fate Shall violate, and she deserves it Madam, Even for that wherein you are excellent, Beauty, in which she shines equall to you Her vertue, if she but maintaine what now She is Mistresse of, beyond all competition, So rich it cannot know to be improv'd, At least in my esteeme, I may offend, But truth shall justifie, I have not flatterd her, I beg your pardon, and to leave my duty Vpon your hand, all that is good flow in you. Exit. Sop. Did he not say Charilla, that he had Another Mistresse? Cha. Such a sound me thought Came from him. Sop. Let's remove, here's too much ayre, The sad note multiplies. Cha. Take courage Madam, And my advice, he has another Mistresse, If he have twenty, be you wise, and crosse him With entertaining twice as many servants, And when he sees your humour heele returne, And sue for any Livery, grieve for this, It must be she, 'tis Polidora has Taken his heart, she live my rivall, How does the thought inflame me. Cha. Polidora? Sop. And yet she does but justly, and he too; I would have rob'd her of Arcadius heart, And they will both have this revenge on me, But something will rebell. Exit. Enter Demetrius, Philocles, Lisander. De. The house is desolate, none comes forth to meete us, Shees slow to entertaine us, Philocles, I prethee tell me, did she weare no cloud Vpon her brow, wast freely that she said We should be welcome. Phi. To my apprehension, Yet tis my wonder she appeares not. Lisa. She nor any other, Sure there's some conceite To excuse it. Dem. Stay, who's this? observe what followes? Phi. Fortune? some maske to entertaine you sir. Enter Fortune crown'd, attended with Youth, Health, and Pleasure. For. Not yet? what silence doth inhabite here? No preparation to bid Fortune welcome! Fortune the genious of the world, have we Descended from our pride, and state to come So farre attended with our darlings, Youth Pleasure, and Health, to be neglected thus? Sure this is not the place? call hither Fame. Enter Fame. Fa. What would great Fortune? For. Know, Who dwels here. Fa. Once more I report great Queene, This is the house of Love. For. It cannot be, This place has too much shade, and lookes as if It had beene quite forgotten of the Spring, And sunne beames Love, affect society And heate, here all is cold as the haires of Winter, No harmony to catch the busie eare Of passengers, no object of delight, To take the wandring eyes, no song, no grone Of Lovers, no complaint of Willow garlands, Love has a Beacon upon his palace top Of flaming hearts, to call the weary pilgrime To rest, and dwell with him, I see no fire To threaten, or to warme, can Love dwell here? Fa. If there be noble love upon the world, Trust Fame, and finde it here. For. Make good your boast and bring him to us. De. What does meane all this? Lisa. I told you sir we should have some device, Enter Love. There's Cupid now, that little Gentleman, Has troubled every masque at Court this seven yeare. Dem. No more. Love. Welcome to Love, how much you honor me! It had become me, that upon your summons I should have waited upon mighty Fortune, But since you have vouchsafed to visite me; All the delights Love can invent, shall flow To entertaine you, Musicke through the ayre Shoote your inticing harmony. For. We came to dance and revell with you Lov. I am poore In my ambition, and want thought to reach How much you honor Love. Dance. Enter Honour. Hon. What intrusion's this? Whom doe you seeke here. Lov. Tis Honour. For. He'e my servant. Lov. Fortune is come to visit us. Hon. And has Corrupted Love, is this thy faith to her, On whom we both waite, to betray her thus To Fortunes triumph, take her giddy wheele, And be no more companion to honour I blush to know thee, whole beleeve there can Be truth in Love hereafter? Lov. I have found My eyes, and see my shame, and with it, this Proud sorceresse, from whom, and all her charmes, I flye agen to Honour, be my guard, Without thee I am lost and cannot boast, The merit of a name. For. Dispis'd? I shall Remember this affront. Dem. What morral's this? Exeunt. Enter Honour with the Crowne upon a mourning Cushion. What melancholly object strikes a suddaine Chillnesse through all my veines, and turnes me Ice? It is the same I sent, the very same, As the first pledge of her insuing greatnesse, Why in this mourning livery, if she live To whom I sent it? ha, what shape of sorrow? Enter Polidora in mourning. It is not Polidora, she was faire Enough, and wanted not the setting off With such a blacke, if thou beest Polidora, Why mournes my love? it neither does become Thy fortune nor my joyes. Pol. But it becomes My griefes, this habit fits a funerall, And it were sinne, my Lord, not to lament A friend new dead. Dem. And I yet living? can A sorrow enter but upon thy garment, Or discomplexion thy attire, whilst I Enjoy a life for thee? who can deserve Weigh'd with thy living comforts, but a peice Of all this Ceremony? give him a name Pol. He was Arcadius. Dem, Arcadius? Pol. A Gentleman that lov'd me dearely once, And does compell these poore, and fruitlesse drops, Which willingly would fall upon his hearse, To imbalme him twice. Dem. And are you sure hees dead? Pol. As sure as you're living sir, and yet I did not close his eyes, but he is dead, And I shall never see the same Arcadius, He was a man so rich in all that's good, At least J thought him so, so perfect in The rules of honour, whom alone to imitate Were glory in a Prince, Nature her selfe Till his creation wrought imperfectly, As she had made but try all of the rest, To mould him excellent. Dem. And is he dead? Come, shame him not with praises, recollect Thy scattered hopes, and let me tell my best, And dearest Polidora, that he lives, Still lives to honour thee. Pol. Lives, where? Dem. Looke here. Am not I worth your knowledge? Pol. And my duty, You are Demetrius King of Epire, sir. I could not easily mistake him so, To whom I gave my heart. Dem. Mine is not chang'd, But still hath fed upon thy memory, These honours, and additions of state Are lent me for thy sake, be not so strange, Let me not lose my entertainement now I am improv'd, and raisd unto the height, Beneath which, I did blush to aske thy love. Pol. Give me your pardon sir, Arcadius, At our last meeting without argument To move him more then his affection to me, Vow'd he did love me; love me bove all women, And to confirme his heart was truely mine, He wish'd, I tremble to remember it, When he forsooke his Polidora's love. That Heaven might kill his happinesse on earth: Was not this nobly said, did not this promise A truth to shame the Turtles? Dem. And his heart Is still the same, and I thy coustant Lover. Pol. Give me your leave I pray, I would not say Arcadius was perjur'd, but the same day Forgetting all his promises, and oathes, While yet they hung upon his lips, forsooke me, Dee not remember this too, gave his faith From me, transported with the noyse of greatnesse, And would be marryed to a Kingdome. Dem. But heaven permitted not I should dispose What was ordain'd for thee. Pol. It was not vertue In him, for sure he found no checke, no sting In his owne bosome, but gave freely all The reines to blind ambition. Dem. I am wounded, The thought of thee ith' throng of all my joyes, Like poyson powr'd in Nectar, turnes me franticke, Deare, if Arcadius have made a fault, Let not Demetrius be punish'd for't, He pleads that ever will be constant to thee. Pol. Shall I beleeve mans flatteries agen, Lose my sweete rest, and peace of thought agen, Be drawne by you, from the streight paths of vertue Into the maze of Love. Dem. I see compassion in thy eye, that chides me If I have either soule, but what's containd Within these words, or if one sillable Of their full force, be not made good by me, May all relenting thoughts in you take end, And thy disdaine be doubled, from thy pardon, Ile count my Coronation, and that houre Fix with a rubricke in my Calender, As an auspicious time to entertaine Affaires of weight with Princes, thinke who now Intreates thy mercy, come thou sha't be kinde, And divide titles with me Pol, Heare me sir, I lov'd you once for vertue, and have not A thought so much unguarded as to be wonne From my truth, and innocence with any Motives of state to affect you, Your bright temptation mournes while it staies here Nor can the triumph of glory, which made you Forget me, so court my opinion backe, Were you no King, I should be sooner drawne Againe to love you, but tis now too late, A low obedience shall become me best: May all the joyes I want Still waite on you, if time hereafter tell you That sorrow for your fault hath strucke me dead, May one soft teare drop from your eye, in pitty Bedew my hearse, and I shall sleepe securely I have but one word more for goodnesse sake, For your owne honour sir correct your passion To her you shall love next, and I forgive you. Exit. Dem. Her heart is frozen up, nor can warme prayers Thaw it to any softnesse. Phi. Ile fetch her sir againe. Dem. Perswade her not. Phi. You give your passion too much leave to triumph. Seeke in another what she denies. Enter Macarius Mac. Where's the King? oh sir, you are undone, A dangerous treason is a foote. Dem. What treason? Mac. Cassander, and Eubulus have proclaim'd Another King, whom they pretend to be Leonatus your elder brother, he that was, But this morning prisoner in the Castle. Dem. Ha? Mac. The easie Epirotes Gather in multitudes to advance his title, They have seased upon the Court, secure your person Whilst we raise power to curbe this insurrection. Ant. Lose no time then. Dem. We will not arme one man, Speake it agen, have I a brother living? And must be no King. Mac. What meanes your grace? Dem. This newes doth speake me happy, it exalts My heart, and makes me capable of more Then twenty Kingdomes. Phi. Will you not sir, stand Vpon your guard? Dem. Ile stand upon my honour, Mercy releives me. Lisa. Will you lose the Kingdome? Dem. The worlds too poore to bribe me, leave Me all, lest you extenuate my fame, and I Be thought to have redeem'd it by your counsell, You shall not share one scruple in the honour; Titles may set a glosse upon our name, But vertue onely is the soule of Fame. Mac. He's strangely possest Gentlemen. Exeunt Omnes.</field>

And is like To keep't, we are alone, what dost thinke of This innovation? ist not a fine Iigge? A precious cunning in the late Protector To shuffle a new Prince into the state. Phi.

It will not please us otherwise, my Lord, We have tride your faith, Eub. Does he not speake, with confidence? Leo. My Lords, and Gentlemen, to whose faith we must Owe next to heaven our fortune, and our safety, After a tedious eclipse, the day Is bright, and we invested in those honours, Our blood, and birth did challenge. Cas. May no time Be registred in our annalls, that shall mention One that had life to oppose your sacred person. Leo. Let them whose titles forg'd and flaw'd suspect Their states security, our right to Epire, Heaven is oblig'd to prosper, treason has No face so blacke to fright it, all my cares Levell to this, that I may worthily Manage the province, and advance the honour Of our deere Country, and be confident, If an expence of blood, may give addition Of any happinesse to you, I shall Offer my heart the sacrifice, and rejoyce To make my selfe a ghost, to have inscrib'd Vpon my marble, but whose cause I dyed for. Enb. May Heaven avert such danger. Cas. Excellent Prince, In whom we see the Coppy of his Father None but the sonne of Theodosius, Could have spoke thus. Leo. You are pleasd to interpret well, Yet give me leave to say in my owne justice, I have but exprest the promptnesse of my soule To serve you all, but tis not empty wishes Can satisfie our mighty charge, a weight Would make an Atlas double, a Kings name Doth sound harmoniously to men at distance, And those who cannot penetrate beyond The barke, and outskinne of a common wealth, Or state, have eyes but ravish'd with the Ceremony That must attend a Prince, and understand not What cares allay the glories of a Crowne, But good Kings finde and feele the contrary, You have tride, my Lord the burden, and can tell It would require a Pilote of more yeares To steere this Kingdome, now impos'd on me, By justice of my birth. Cas. I wish not life, But to partake those happy dayes, which must Succeed these faire proceedings, we are blest, But sir be sparing to your selfe, we shall Hazard our joyes in you too soone, the burden Of state affaires impose upon your counsell. Tis fitter that we waste our lives then you, Call age too soone upon you with the trouble, And cares that threaten such an undertaking, Preserve your youth. Leo. And choose you our protector, Ist that you would conclude my Lord? We will Deserve our subjects faith for our owne sake, Not sit an idle gazer at the helme. Enter Messenger. Phi. How observ'd you that, Marke how Cassander's planet strucke. Eu. He might have lookd more calmely for all that I begin to feare; but doe not yet seeme troubled. Leo. With what newes travailes his hast? I must secure My selfe betimes, not be a King in jest, And weare my crowne a tenant to their breath. Cas. Demetrius sir, your brother, With other traytors that oppose your claimes Are fled to the Castle of Nestorius And fortifie. Mes. I said not so my Lord. Cas. Ile have it thought so, hence. Exit Messen. Leo. Plant forces to batter The wals, and in their ruine bring us word They live not. Eub. Good sir heare me. Cas. Let it worke, Were Demetrius dead, we easily might uncrowne This swolne impostor, and my sonne be faire To peice with young Sophia, who I heare Repents her late affront. Eub. Their lives may doe You service, let not blood staine your beginnings The people not yet warme in their allegiance, May thinke it worth their tumult to revenge it With hazard of your selfe. Leo. Who dares but thinke it? Yet offer first our mercy, if they yeeld. Demetrius must not live, my Lord your counsell, What if he were in heaven? Cas. You have my consent, You shannot stay long after him. Leo. Sophia is Not my sister, To prevent al that may indanger us, wee'l marry her That done no matter though we stand discover'd, For in her title then we are King of Epire, Without dispute. Cas. Hum? in my judgement sir, That wonot doe so well. Leo. Whats your opinion? Cas. He countermines my plot: are you so cunning Leo. Whats that you mutter sir? Cas. I mutter sir? Leo. Best say I am no King, but some impostor Rais'd up to gull the state. Cas. Very fine to have said within Few houres you'd beene no King, nor like to be, Was not in the compasse of high treason I take it. Eub. Restraine your anger, the Kings mov'd, speake not, Cas. I will speake louder, doe I not know him? That selfe same hand that raisd him to the throne Shall plucke him from it, is this my reward? Leo. Our guard, to prison with him, Cas. Me to prison? Leo. Off with his head. Cas. My head? Eub. Vouchsafe to heare me, great sir. Cas. How dares he be so insolent? J ha wrought my selfe into a fine condition, Dee know me Gentlemen? Phi. Very well my Lord; How are we bound to heaven for multiplying These blessings on the Kingdome. Leo. We allow it. Eub. Counsell did never blast a Princes eare. Leo. Convey him to the sanctuary of rebels, Nestorius house, where our proud brother has Ensconsd himselfe, theyle entertaine him lovingly, He will be a good addition to the traitors, Obey me or you dye for't, what are Kings When subjects dare affrout em. Cas. I shall vex Thy soule for this. Leo. Away with him, when Kings Frowne, let offenders tremble, this flowes not From any cruelty in my nature, but The fate of an usurper, he that will Be confirm'd great without just title to it, Must lose compassion, know whats good, not doe it. Exeunt. Enter Polidora and her servant. Ser. Madam, the Princesse Sophia. Pol. I attend her highnesse. Enter Sophia. How much your grace honours your humble servant Sop. I hope my brother's well. Pol. I hope so too Madam. Sop. Doe you but hope? he came to be your guest. Pol. We are all his whilst he is pleasd to honour This poore roofe with his royall presence Madam. Sop. I came to aske your pardon Polidora, Pol. You never Madam trespas'd upon me, Wrong not your goodnesse. Sop. I can be but penitent, Vnlesse you point me out some other way To satisfie. Pol. Deere Madam doe not mocke me. Sop. there is no injury like that to love, I finde it now in my owne sufferings, But though I would have rob'd thee of Arcadius Heaven knew a way to reconcile your hearts, And punishd me in those joyes you have found, I read the story of my losse of honour, Yet can rejoyce, and heartily, that you Have met your owne agen. Pol. Whom doe you meane? Sop. My brother. Pol. He is found to himselfe and honour, He is my King, and though I must acknowledge He was the glory of my thoughts, and I Lov'd him as you did Madam, with desire To be made his, reason, and duty since, Form'd me to other knowledge, and I now Looke on him without any wish of more Then to be call'd his subject. Sop. Has he made Himselfe lesse capable by being King. Pol. Of what? Sop. Of your affection. Pol. With your pardon Madam. Love in that sense you meane, lest Polidora When he forsooke Arcadius, I disclaime All tyes betweene us, more then what a name Of King must challenge from my obedience. Sop. This does confirme my jealousie, my heart, For my sake Madam, has he lost his value? Pol. Let me beseech your grace, I may have leave To answer in some other cause, or person, This argument but opens a sad wound To make it bleed a fresh, we may change this Discourse, I would elect some subject, whose Prayses may more delight your eare then this Can mine; let's talke of young Lisimachus. Sop. Ha? my presaging feares. Pol. How does your grace? Sop. Well, you were talking of Lisimachus, Pray give me your opinion of him. Pol. Mine? It will be much short of his worth, J thinke him A gentleman so perfect in all goodnesse, That if there be one in the world deserves The best of women, heaven created him, To make her happy. Sop. You have in a little, Madam, Exprest a Volume of mankind, a miracle, But all have not the same degree of faith, He is but young. Pol. What mistresse would desire Her servant old? he has both Spring to please Her eye, and Summer to returne a harvest. Sop. He is blacke. Pol. He sets a beauty off more rich, And she thats faire will love him, faint complections Betray effeminate mindes, and love of change, Two beauties in a bed, compound few men, He's not so faire to counterfeit a woman, Nor yet so blacke, but blushes may betray His modesty. Sop. His proportion exceeds not. Pol. That praises him, and well compacted frame Speakes temper, and sweet flow of elements, Vast buildings are more oft for shew then use, I would not have my eyes put to the travell Of many acres, ere I could examine A man from head to foote, he has no great, But he may boast, an eligant composition. Sop. Ile heare no more, you have so farre outdone My injuries to you, that I call backe My penitence, and must tell Polidora, This revenge ill becomes her. Am I thought So lost in soule to heare, and forgive this? In what shade doe I live? or shall I thinke I have not at the lowest enough merit, Setting aside my birth, to poyze with yours, Forgive my modest thoughts, if I rise up My owne defence, and tell this unjust Lady So great a Winter hath not frozen yet My cheeke, but there is something nature planted, That carries as much bloome, and spring upon't As yours, what flame is in your eye, but may Finde competition here (forgive agen My Virgin honour,) what is in your lip, To tice the enamour'd soule, to dwell with more Ambition then the yet unwithered blush That speakes the innocence of mine. Enter Demetrius. Oh brother? Dem. Ile talke with you anon, my Polidora, Allow thy patience till my breath recover Which now come; laden with the richest newes Thy eare was ever blest with. Sop. Both your lookes, And voyce expresse some welcome accident. De. Guesse what in wish could make me fortunate And heaven hath dropt that on Demetrius. Sop. What meanes this extasie? Dem. Twere sinne to busie Thy thoughts upon't, Ile tell thee that I could Retaine some part, tis too wide a joy To be exprest so soone, and yet it falls In a few sillables, thou wot scarce beleeve me, I am no King. Sop. Hows that! Pol. Good heaven forbid. De. Forbid? Heaven has releiv'd me with a mercy I knew not how to aske, I have they say An elder brother living, crown'd already, I onely keepe my name Demetrius, Without desire of more addition, Then to returne thy servant. Pol. You amaze me, Can you rejoyce to be deposd: Dem. It but Translates me to a fairer and better Kingdome In Polidora. Pol. Mee? Dem. Did you not say, Were I no King you could be drawne to love Me agen, that was consented to in Heaven, A Kingdome first betray'd my ambitious soule To forget thee, that, and the flattering glories, How willingly Demetrius doe resigne, The Angels know, thus naked without titles I throw me on thy charity, and shall Boast greater Empire to be thine agen, then To weare the triumphs of the world upon me. Enter Macarius. Mac. Be not so carelesse of your selfe, the people Gather in multitudes, to your protection Offering their lives, and fortunes, if they may But see you sir, and heare you speake to em, Accept their duties, and in time prevent Your ruine. Sop. Be not desperate, tis counsell. Dem. You trouble me with noyse, speake Polidora Pol. For your owne sake preserve your selfe, My feares distract my reason. Enter Antigonus. Ant. Lord Lisimachus With something that concernes your safety, is Fled hither, and desires a present hearing. Mac. His soule is honest, be not sir a madman, And for a Lady give up all our freedomes. Exit. Pol. Ile say any thing here Lisimachus. Sop. Deare brother heare him. Enter Lisimachus. Lisi. Sir, I come to yeeld My selfe your prisoner, if my father have Raisd an Impostor to supplant your title Which I suspect and inwardly doe bleed for. I shall not onely by the tender of My selfe declare my innocence, but either By my unworthy life secure your person, Or by what death you shall impose, reward The unexpected treason. Sop. Brave young man, Did you not heare him brother? Lisi. I am not minded. Pol. Be witnesse Madam, I resigne my heart It never was anothers, you declare Too great a satisfaction, I hope This will destroy your jealousie, Remember now your danger. Dem. I dispise it, What fate dares injure me? Lisi. Yet heare me sir. Sop. Forgive me Polidora, you are happy, My hopes are remov'd farther, I had thought Lisimachus had meant you for his mistresse, Tis misery to feed, and not know where To place my jealousie. Enter Macarius. Mac. Now tis too late, You may be deafe, untill the Cannon make, You finde your sence, we are shut up now by A troupe of Horse, thanke your selfe. Pol. They will Admit conditions. Sop. And allow us quarter. a shout within. Pol. We are all lost. Dem. Be comforted. Enter Antigonus. Ant. Newes my Lord Cassander sent by the new King. To beare us company. Dem. Not as prisoner? Ant. It does appeare no otherwise, the souldiers Declare how much they love him, by their noyse Of scorne, and joy to see him so rewarded. Dem. It cannot be. Ant. Youle finde it presently, He curses the new King, talkes treason gainst him As nimble as he were in's shirt, he's here, Enter Cassander. Cas. Oh let me beg untill my knees take roote Ith' earth, sir, can you pardon me? Dem. For what? Cas. For Treason, desperate, most malicious treason I have undone you sir. Dem. It does appeare You had a will. Cas. Ile make you all the recompence I can, But ere you kill me heare me, know the man, Whom I to serve my unjust ends, advanc'd To your throne, is an impostor, a meere counterfeit, Eubulus sonne. Exit Anti. Dem. It is not then our brother? Cas. An insolent usurper, proud, and blooddy Seleucus, is no leprosie upon me? There is not punishment enough in nature To quit my horrid act, I have not in My stocke of blood to satisfie with weeping, Nor could my soule though melted to a flood Within me, gush out teares to wash my staine off. Dem. How? an Impostor, what will become on's now? We are at his mercy. Cas. Sir, the peoples hearts Will come to their owne dwelling, when they see I dare accuse my selfe, and suffer for it, Have courage then young King, thy fate cannot Be long compell'd. Dem. Rise, our misfortune Carries this good, although it lose our hopes, It makes you friend with vertue, weele expect What providence will doe. Cas. You are too mercifull. Lisi. Our duties shall beg heaven still to preserve you. Enter Antigonus. Ant. Our enemy desires some parley sir. Lisi. 'Tis not amisse to heare their proposition. Pol. Ile waite upon you. Dem. Thou art my angell, and canst best instruct me, Boldly present our selves, you'le with Cassander. Cas. And in death be blest To finde your charity. Exit Sop. Lisimachus, Lisi. Madam. Sop. They will not misse your presence, the small time Is spent in asking of a question. Lisi. I waite your pleasure. Sop. Sit I have a suite to you. Lisi. To me? it must be granted. Sop. If you have Cancell'd your kinde opinion of me, Deny me not to know, who hath succeeded Sophia in your heart. I beg the name Of your new Mistresse. Lisi. You shall know her Madam, If but these tumults cease, and fate allow us To see the Court agen, I hope youle bring No mutiny against her, but this is No time to talke of Love, let me attend you. Sop. I must expect, till you are pleasd to satisfie My poore request, conduct me at your pleasure. Exeunt Enter Leonatus, Eubulus, Bishop, Lisander, Philocles. Leo. They are too slow, dispatch new messengers, To entreat em fairely hither, J am extasied, Were you witnesse for me too, is it possible I am what this affirmes, true Leonatus; And were you not my father, was I given In trust to you an Infant? Eub. Tis a truth, Our soule's bound to acknowledge, you supply'd The absence and opinion of my sonne, Who dyed but to make you my greater care I know not of Demetrius, but suppos'd Him dead indeed, as Epire thought you were, Your Fathers character doth want no testimony, Which but compar'd with what concernes Demetrius Will prove it selfe King Theodosius act, Your royall Father. Bish. I am subscrib'd to both his Legacies By oath oblig'd to secresie, untill Thus fairely summon'd to reveale the trust. Eub. Cassander had no thought you would prove thus. To whose policy I gave this aime, although He wrought you up to serve but as his engine To batter young Demetrius, for it was Your Fathers prudent jealousie, that made him Give out your earely deaths, as if his soule Prophesi'd his owne first, and fear'd to leave Either of you to the unsafe protection, Of one whose study would be to supplant Your right, and make himselfe the King of Epire. Bish. Your sister faire Sophia in your Fathers Life, was design'd to marry with Lisimachus That guarded her, although she us'd some art To quit her pupillage, and being absolute, Declar'd love to Demetrius, which enforc'd Macarius to discover first your brother. Leo. No more, least you destroy agen Leonatus, With wonder of his fate, are they not come yet? Something it was, I felt within my envy Of young Demetrius fortune, there were seeds Scatterd upon my heart, that made it swell With thought of Empire, Princes I see cannot Be totally eclipst, but wherefore stayes Demetrius, and Sophia, at whose names A gentle spirit walk'd upon my blood. Enter Demetrius, Polidora, Sophia, Macarius, Cassander, Lisimac. Eub. They are here, Leo. Then thus I flye into their bosomes, Nature has rectifi'd in me Demetrius, The wandrings of ambition, our deere sister You are amaz'd, I did expect it, read Assurance there, the day is bigge with wonder, Mac. What meanes all this? Leo. Lisimachus, be deare to us, Cassander, you are welcome too. Cas. Not I, I doe not looke for't, all this shannot bribe My conscience to your faction, and make Me false agen, Seleucus is no sonne Of Theodosius, my deare Countrymen Correct your erring duties, and to that, Your lawfull King, prostrate your selves, Demetrius Doth challenge all your knees. Dem. All love and duty, Flow from me to my royall King, and brother I am confirm'd. Cas. You are too credulous, What can betray your faith so much? Leo. Sophia, you appeare sad, as if your will Gave no consent to this dayes happynesse. Sop. No joy exceeds Sophia's for your selfe. Lisi. With your pardon sir, I apprehend A cause that makes her troubled, she desires To know what other mistresse since her late Vnkindnesse, I have chosen to direct My faith and service. Leo. Another Mistresse. Lisi. Yes sir. Leo. And does our sister love Lisimachus? Sop. Here's something would confesse. Leo. He must not dare To affront Sophia. Cas. How my shame confounds me, I beg your justice, without pitty on My age. Leo. Your penance shall be, to be faithfull To our state hereafter. Omnes. May you live long and happy, Leonatus King of Epire. Leo. But where's your other Mistresse? Lisi. Even here sir. Leo. Our sister? is this another Mistresse sir? Lisi. It holds To prove my thoughts were so when she began Her sorrow for neglecting me, that sweetnesse Deserv'd I should esteeme her another mistresse, Then when she cruelly forsooke Lisimacus, Your pardon Madam, and receive a heart Proud with my first devotions to serve you Sop. In this I am crownd agen, now mine for ever. Leo. You have deceiv'd her happily, Ioy to you both. Dem. We are ripe for the same wishes, Polidora's part of me. Pol. He all my blessing. Leo. Heaven powre full joyes upon yon. Mac, We are all blest, There wants but one to fill your armes. Leo. My mistresse, And wife shall be my Country, to which I Was in my birth contracted, your love since Hath playd the Priest to perfect what was Ceremony Though Kingdomes, by just titles prove our owne, The subjects hearts doe best secure a Crowne. Exeunt Omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue. There is no Coronation to day, Vnlesse your gentle votes doe crowne our Play, If smiles appeare within each Ladies eye, Which are the leading starres in this faire skie, Our solemne day sets glorious, for then We hope by their soft influence, the men Will grace what they first shinde on, mak't appeare, (Both) how we please, and blesse our covetous eare With your applause, more welcome then the Bells, Upon a triumph, Bonfires, or what else Can speake a Coronation. And though I Were late dispos'd and spoyl'd of Majesty, By the kind ayde of your hands, Gentlemen, I quickely may be Crown'd a Queene agen. FINIS.</field>
