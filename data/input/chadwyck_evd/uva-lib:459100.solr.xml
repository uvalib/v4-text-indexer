      <field name="fulltext">MegÃ¦ra ascends. MegÃ¦ra. Thus to the Romane Palace, as our home And proper mansion, is MegÃ¦ra come No stranger to these walls: not more in Hell Then here, doe mischiefs, and we Furies dwell Let the unenvy'd Gods henceforth possesse Poore Peasants hearts, and rule in Cottages; Let Vertue lurke among the rurall Swaines, Whilest Vice in Romes Imperiall Palace reignes, And rules those breasts, whom all the world obeys. What though the Gods and Vertue first did raise Rome to that height it holds? they did but make An Empire large enough for us to take, And build a strength for us to manage now, Though Vertue made the Romane greatnesse grow: Shee now forsakes it at the height: the Powers, And fruits of all her diligence are ours. But to preserve that interest, and keep high Our hold in thus commanding family, A blacker Fury then my selfe must rise, To fill these roofes with fresh Impieties. Rise cruell Ghost, ascend Caligula, That lately didst the worlds proud scepter sway Beyond our wish; who though an Emperour, In wickednesse wer't greater then in power; And cloth'd with flesh among mankind did'st dwell A Fiend more black then any was in Hell. From those darke vaults ascend; to blast this faire And gorgious Palace, like that poisonous aire, Which Earth-quakes from the grounds torne entrailes breath To fill the world with pestilence and death. Hee comes; Hee comes: the very house begins To shake with horrour of approching sinnes. The night growes blacker then before, and I My selfe am fill'd with new Impiety. Caligula's Ghost. Why am I raised from the vaults below? What mischiefs can an aÃ«ry shadow doe? What can a naked Ghost performe? In vain Are all intents, unlesse I reign'd againe Obey'd by all the Romane power, and wore That wicked body which I had before. What then I did you know, and if your power Could have maintain'd me longer Emperour, I had outdone your wishes, and given birth To such new mischiefes, as the suffring earth Had groan'd to feele: what my intentions were Did to the world in those black bookes appeare, When all Romes Senate were to death design'd, And chests of poison that I left behind, Which since my death into the Ocean throwne, Poison'd the waves for many leagues, and on Poore fishes wrought that execution, Which on mankind I ment they should have done. What can I now performe alas? MegÃ¦ra. Enough. With thy contagious presence blast this roofe; Infect th'Imperiall House with all the ill That Hell and thou canst bring. Let mischiefe still Reigne here, and keep out banish'd Piety, Iustice, and Conscience; let no sacred ty Of Nature, or Religious lawes restraine Their Parricidall hands: all names bee vaine Of brother, childe, or parent. let the wife with impious rage destroy her husbands life, The brother kill the brother, and the Sonne Rip up his parents bowels. Ghost. 'Twill be done. The actors are my kindred, and like mine Must play their parts: ambitious Agrippine, Pursue thy cruell projects, and upon A husband's murther raise thy Impious Sonne, That he may play the Parricide againe, And murder thee, that gav'st him life and reigne. That all the world astonish'd at so high Ingratitude and foule Impiety, May feare the Monsters reigne, yet suffer more Then they could feare, or ere was felt before. Let what no foes, no furies durst conspire To act 'gainst Rome, nor I my selfe desire When I was Prince; bee cursed Nero's crimes. Let his dire story in succeeding times From all earths Tyrants else the wonder draw, And men almost forget Caligula. MegÃ¦ra. The Fates consent; that thunder, which wee heare From Acheron, confirmes the Omen there. Downe wicked Ghost into thy cell below, Wee must no longer hide; the Cocks doe crow, The twinkling starres begin to hide their heads The day would dawne, and from Auroraes bed Would Titan rise, but that he feares to see Such instruments of Hells impiety. The Gods themselves forbid our longer stay, For feare our presence should retard the day. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. Scen. I. Pallas, Vitellius, Pollio. Pallas. Now is the time noble Vitellius, For you, and you most honour'd Pollio, To make that service you have done compleat To royall Agrippina; briefly thus: The two commanders o'th' PrÃ¦torian campe Crispinus Rufus, and that Lucius Geta Must be displac'd, and some of neerer trust To her designes advanced in their roome, Or else our power will nere be full, they love Britannicus too well, this is the thing The Empresse wishes; let your eloquence And wisdome further it in CÃ¦sar's eare. Vitelli. Feare us not Pallas; but what successes; Have wee to take their charge? Pallas. One must take all. You may pretend the inconvenience Of two commanders, and so take from CÃ¦sar All jealousie of the plot. Pollio. Who shall it be? Pallas. Burrhus Afranius a wise valiant man, Belov'd and honour'd by the souldiers. None can except against him, and the change Will not displease the campe: nor can his merit Make him lesse thankfull to her; knowing well, 'Twas in her power to make it otherwise. But the advancing of such able men As Seneca and Burrhus will take off All envy from the Empresse and our selves. Then wee with praise have wrought our purposes, And made our party strong, while Seneca Shall sway the Senate, Burrhus rule the campe To her designes: but I'le presume no farther T'instruct your wisedomes, or much lesse to doubt Your true affections to the state and honour Of Agrippina, who will then have power To make more large requitall to her friends, In which most high and happy ranke, you two Are chiefly seated: shee acknowledges Her selfe indebted to your eloquence Noble Vitellius, who in Senate lately You proov'd her marriage lawfull and being Censor, Depos'd Silenus from his PrÃ¦torship, Who should have married young Octavia. To you, brave Pollio, whose perswasions Have beene the cause young Nero now enjoyes That happy marriage, which Silanus lost. But most of all shee ow'd to both your paines. In causing CÃ¦sar to adopt her Nero. Vitellius. 'Twas hard to worke at first. CÃ¦sar stuck at it, Alledging that the Claudian family Never adopted any, and besides When Lucius Geta and Crispinus Rufus In love they bore to young Britannicus Told him that that adoption to the world Would bee ridiculous: by president Wee did refute it, shewing how Tiberius Having a Sonne and Nephew both alive, Adopted th'issue of Germanions. Pallas. My Lords, 'twas nobly carryed; this designe That now wee have in hand, though not so hard To worke, will prove as advantageous. Bee you with CÃ¦sar; I'le goe satisfie The Empresse of your loves. Vitellius., Pollio. Farewell brave Pallas. Exeunt Vitel. &amp; Pol. Pallas. Farewell my Lords. Goe flattering Senatours, Goe use your best perswasive eloquence, Whilest I alone upon your envie rise, Whilest I injoy in Agrippinaes love The fruit of your obsequious diligence. What though my birth be humble, and my stile But one of CÃ¦sars freed-men, though I boast not Patritian blood, nor in my galleries Display old ranks of nose-lesse ancestours, Or eare-cropt images, if I enjoy What ever high Nobility can give Respect and power: the state can witnesse it. The Senate feare mee, and in flattery Have su'd to CÃ¦sar to conferre on mee PrÃ¦torian and QuÃ¦storian ornaments. Which I at last vouchsafed to accept. When my command alone has doom'd to death The noblest of that order; men whose names Old Rome has boasted of, whose vertues rais'd Her to that envi'd height that now she holds. Their murders stupid CÃ¦sar rather chose To take upon himselfe, then question mee. Let dull Patricians boast their aÃ«ry titles, And count me base, whilest I commend their lives, And for the furtherance of my high intents, Make noblest men my hated instruments. Enter Narcissus. But ha! Narcissus? yes; there comes a man That was my rivall once, whom I fear'd more Then all the Lords of Rome, my fellow free'd man, That knew our wayes of power; that not the Senate, But CÃ¦sars chamber did command the world, And rule the fate of men: but Fortune's turn'd, And he not worth my regard or feare. In mastring him I feele my greatest strength exit Narcissus. Not looke upon mee! am I fall'n so low? Did I in equall place with this proud man, Nay farre above him, sway the state, and rule Great CÃ¦sar's heart, while Messallina liv'd, And was not there content (Oh punishment Of my ambitious aimes) but caus'd the death Of that loose Empresse to bring in th'expulst Aelia Petina, and instead of her Have let this Tygresse Agrippina in This dragon spirit to devour us all Except proud Pallas her adulterer? What unavoided dangers every way Threaten this life? For if young Nero reigne, I dye, that sought to crosse his mothers match: If ere Britannicus do reigne, I dye That caus'd his mothers death. What shall I doo? Where shall I leane for safety? better trust The innocent goodnesse of Britannicus Then Agrippinaes feirce and cruell nature; Nor can I hope more goodnesse from her sonne. That may give longer respite to my feare. Besides it beares the greater shew of justice, And honest service to my Roiall Master. Since wee must fall, it is some happinesse To fall the honest way, if wee may call That honesty at all, or reall vertue To which necessity enforces us, And wee by fortune not election practise. Enter Geta, Crispinus. Here comes two freinds of young Britannicus; Haile Lucius Geta, haile Crispinus Rufus. Geta. Narcissus haile. Narcissus, Brave Romans your are come Fitly to ease my overburden'd breast Of weighty thoughts, which I dare freely trust Vnto your noble eares. Geta. You may Narcissus Trust truth with us. Crispinus. Or any honest secret. Geta. What is't you would with us? Narcissus. You know my Lords, (And I must needs confesse) I was a meanes Of Messalinaes death; but all the Gods Can witnesse with mee how unwillingly I lent a hand to that sad action; And but for CÃ¦sar's safety, which I prize Above my life and fortunes, and which then I thought endanger'd much by her hold act, Nought in the world could ere have moov'd mee to it. Crispinus. What hence would you inferre? Narcissus. Then Know my Lords, How little I respect my private ends To doe the publike service, and can loose My selfe for CÃ¦sars good: it may be thought When the most hopefull Prince Britannicus Shall weare that wreath which all the world adores, To me it may be fatall, as a foe Vnto his mother: but I rather wish My selfe for ever lost, then that brave Prince Should not succeed his father. Geta. How! succeed? What feare is there of that? Crispinus. What power on earth, Can barre his right, whilest wee command the campe? I'de rather see (which all the Gods avert) Rome rent againe with civill broiles, then hee Should loose unjustly the Imperiall throne. Narcissus. Y'are true and Noble friends; and here I vow To joyne with you, and use my uttermost power T'advance the honour of Britannicus. Crispinus. What danger threatens it? Narcissus. Doe you not know To whom the Sonne of Agrippina's married; Crispinus. Yes. Narcissus. And that honor were enough for him. Without adoption too, were his aimes private, And that his crafty Mother did not cast A way for him to the succession. Crispinus. 'Twas strangely done of CÃ¦sar I confesse. Narcissus. They make the faction strong, and cunningly Encrease the traine of Nero, and displace The faithfull servants af Britannicus. Wise Seneca's recall'd from banishment By Agrippinaes meanes, not for the love Shee beares his vertue; but to make him hers, That Seneca's authority may gaine The peoples love to her ambitious sonne, Of whose young yeares hee takes tuition. Crispinus. I think no lesse. Geta. Besides to make the match For her young Nero with Octavia. Noble Silanus dy'd, who might have proov'd A faithfull propto Claudius family. Narcissus. In blood that fatall marriage was begun, I feare the Omen; Agrippina's feirce And cruell nature has too much been seene In this short time. Lollia Paulina, Neece To Cotta Messalinus, and late wife To Caius CÃ¦sar, for no other cause Then aiming once at Claudius marriage Is banish'd Italy; her goods are seiz'd, And but five millions of Sesterces left her Of all her great estate; but there the malice Of this fell woman stayes not: now wee heare A Tribune is dispatch'd away, to kill The banish'd Lady, and bring back her head. Crispinus. Oh barbarous cruelty! Narcissus. Yet more I feare, Since her Domitius is adopted now. I feare shee'll shortly aime at higher blood. Geta. Wee'll guard the life of young Britannicus. Narcissus. And I'll be vigilant for CÃ¦sar's safety. When all her ends are wrought, his death is next. Enter Britannicus. Geta. Here comes the youthfull hope of Rome and us. Britanicus. Tell mee, my friends, am not I CÃ¦sar's sonne? Crispinus. My Lord, who dares to question it? Britannicus. I'm sure, I was his eldest sonne, and whilest I liv'd I thought that CÃ¦sar had not lack'd an heire But I at last have found an elder brother, Domitius is adopted CÃ¦sar's sonne His name is Nero now. I cannot tell What is my fault. Geta. Excellent youth, how much Beyond his yeeres hee apprehends his wrongs? Crispinus. Feare not sweet Prince, though Agrippinas sonne Bee two yeere elder then your selfe, the Senate Will never judge that an adopted Sonne Shall in succession bee preferr'd before The true and naturall heire. Britannicus. You ever lov'd mee, Pray doe so still. Geta. While wee have breath, my Lord, you shall command our lives. Crispinus. How unawares Has feeble CÃ¦sar wrought a snare to catch His own unhappy life in! grow sweet prince, Grow up to strengthen the Imperiall house, And Curbe the furious malice of thy foes. Enter Nero, Pallas. Nero. Brother Britannicus haile. Britannicus. Haile to you Domitius Anobarbus. Nero. Doe you scorne My salutation, or not know my name? Britannicus. That was your fathers name; and why not yours? Nero. How's that? Proud boy. Exeunt Brit. &amp; reliqui. Pallas. Well, let them goe, my Lord. 'Twas not the braine of young Britannicus That could give birth to this minurious scorne, Though for his yeeres, the boy be capable. But riper heads then his: there went his counsell Crispinus Rufus, and that Lucius Geta, Who swell the youth with boasting hopes, and thinke Their power can give protection to his pride. I'le make them see their errour, and perceive, One breath of mine can blow them from their strengths. This newes I'll beare to Agrippina straight. Come Prince; Britannicus shall find anon What feeble props his pride has lean'd upon. Exeunt. Agrippina, Seneca, Vitellius, Pollio. Agrippina. You are my Judges. Seneca. Your poore servants, Madam. Agrippina. Nay that must be your office; you have read My Commentaries over, and I looke for A faithfull censure: I am sure, my Lords, You have both learning able to discerne, And such integritie as will not flatter. Speake Seneca; I see they looke on you: How doe you like them? Seneca. Royall Agrippina, Such, and so good they bee, that ablest men May boldly speake, and not offend the truth, Nor you at all; the stile is full and Princely. Vitellius. Stately and absolute, beyond what ere These eyes have seene; and Rome, whose majestie Is there describ'd, in after times shall owe For her memoriall to your learned pen, More then to all those fading monuments Built with the riches of the spoiled world. When rust shall eate her brasse, when times strong hand Shall bruise to dust her marble Palaces, Triumphall Arches, Pillars, Obeliskes, When Julius Temple, Claudius AquÃ¦ducts, Agrippa's Baths, and Pompey's Theater, Nay Rome it selfe shall not be found at all, Historians books shall live; those strong records, Those deathlesse monuments alone shall shew What, and how great the Roman Empire was. Pollio. The act is Noble; not the present world Alone shall owe to Agrippinas worth (As for her gratious government it does) But future ages shall acknowledge more To the rich labours of her Royall pen. Agrippina. The wisest Princes never sought to raise Their present state alone, but to preserve Themselves immortall by an endlesse fame. For memory of mee, besides these bookes, If that our Augures faile not in their skill, Or flatter not, that German Colony, Which I of late deducted o're the Rhine To Ubium, for evermore the name Of Agrippinaes Colony shall beare. Vitellius. That act, though great, declares your power alone, Your wealth and greatnesse: but these learned bookes Expresse your wisedome, and for these you owe Nothing at all to Fortune. Agrippina. Thus I meane To spend all time which from affaires of state, And businesse of our Empire can be spar'd. Seneca. Is she already turn'd our Emperour? Agrippina. Those wretches have too narrow soules, who thinke That persons great and eminent in state Can spare no time to purchase fame by writing, But what they steale from action and imployment, As if no mind were large enough for both. Who was more full of action, and more fit To rule, nay rule the world, then Julius CÃ¦sar? Yet he was of my mind. Seneca. Oh strange male spirit! Can there be found no other parallell But Julius CÃ¦sar to a womans minde? Agrippina. Yet Julius was too blame, hee toild too much To get his honour, and too much debarr'd His nature the free use of Princely pleasures. Sure Lucius Sylla had an ample minde; Tis Syllaes Character, that Salust gives him, A free and great enjoyer of his pleasures, Yet how industrious his actions speake, Hee found fit time to rule the Romane world, And write both Greeke and Latine Commentaries. Seneca. The soules of Sylla and of CÃ¦sar both I thinke have enter'd her. Agrippina. Well worthy friends, You doe approve my way of writing then. Seneca. Yes gracious Madam; and because you nam'd Great Julius to us, I was thinking now That as in blood, so in your stiles of writing There was some neerenesse. Agrippina. Seneca, I thanke you; But I confesse your positive approbation Pleas'd mee as well as that comparison. Seneca. Does not your Majestie esteeme his booke? Agrippina. Indifferent well; a good loose carelesse way. I thinke directly with Asinius Pollio, Had CÃ¦sar liv'd, hee would have mended it; The man had farre more in him then that shewes. Seneca. Yet under favour, Madam, some have thought Those Commentaryes hardly could be mended, A stile so strong, naked, and beautifull, Free from affected words, and from all glosse Or dresse of Oratory, as in stead Of leading others in a way to write, It quite discourages the ablest men. So Hirtius thought, and that fam'd Cicero, The greatest master of Romes eloquence. Agrippina. Are those your authors then? that Hirtius Was CÃ¦sars servant partiall in his heart, Or else hee flatter'd him; for Cicero, They were so farre out of his tedious straine, Hee could not censure them. Seneca. Yet able men Can truly censure of another stile Then what themselves have us'd. Agrippina. Hee was not able, No, not in Oratory; had I rul'd Rome and her Senate then, as now I doe, Not all th'Orations that e're Cicero Made in the Senate, should have sav'd one haire Of an offendour, or condemn'd a Mouse. Vitellius. How confident shee is in censuring! Seneca. I am amaz'd: but let her have her way. Forgive my silence noble Cicero; Here thy defence is vaine; but what I spare, The tongues of all posterity shall speake. Enter Pallas, Tribune. Pallas. The Tribune, Madam, is return'd and brings Lollia Paulinaes head. Agrippina. Let him come in. Tribune. Your pleasure, great Augusta, is perform'd. Agrippina. Let me peruse this face: ha! 'tis much chang'd. Her teeth shall make me sure, they did not grow Dio. The common way; I am confirm'd; 'tis shee. Reward him Pallas. Tribune. The Gods preserve Augusta Agrippina. Agrippina. O pale death, Thou mock of beauty, and of greatnesse too: Was this the face, that once in CÃ¦sar's love Was Agrippinaes rivall, and durst hope As much 'gainst mee, as my unquestion'd power Has wrought on her? Was this that beautie, once That wore the riches of the world about it? For whose attire, all lands, all seas were search'd, All creatures rob'd? This! This was that Paulina, Whom Cajus CÃ¦sar serv'd, whom Rome ador'd And the world feared. Seneca. Such a sight mee 'thinks Should make her sadly thinke of humane frailty. Agrippina. Take hence the head, least in her death shee gaine A greater conquest o're mee, then her life Could ever doe, to make me shed a teare. I would not wrong the justice I have done So much as to lament it now: You know My friends, shee had a spirit dangerous. And though my nature could have pardon'd her, Reason of state forbade it, which then told mee Great ruines have been wrought by foolish pity. Seneca. Would shee had such a nature! but 'tis now Too late to give her counsell. Pallas. So letall That dare contest with Agrippina, fall. Enter servant. Servant. CÃ¦sar is come to visite you. Agrippina. Now friends, Vitellius, Pollio, Pallas second mee. Enter CÃ¦sar, Antistius. CÃ¦sar. How fares my Agrippina? Agrippina. Wondrous well, When I am blest with CÃ¦sars company. CÃ¦sar. That shall be oft, my love, when Romes affaires, And publike businesse will give me leave. Agrippina. I would partake my selfe of those affaires, Rather then want your presence Pallas. I beleeve it. CÃ¦sar. Thou shalt; 'tis onely for thy dearest sake I love my fortunes, thy sweet fellowship Makes light the burthen of my government. Agrippina. To ease great CÃ¦sars care, shall ever bee The height of my desires: before you came My heart was sad. I sent for these my friends T'impart the reason to them. CÃ¦sar. Sad; for what? Agrippina. Weighing the troubles of a Princely state, And all the dangers that still threaten it. CÃ¦sar. Dangers! Pallas. Shee strikes upon the fittest string; No passion reignes in him so much as feare. Agrippina. Wee were devising of the fittest meanes To give your state security: you know Your strongest guard is the PrÃ¦torian campe. CÃ¦sar. Most true. Agrippina. That campe commanded now by two, May be by Captaines too ambitious strife Divided into factions, and so made Lesse serviceable, should your safety need them. Vitellius. CÃ¦sar remembers when that bold attempt Of Silius was, how the PrÃ¦torian campe Was by their generall strife in mutiny, And had not one been chosen for that day To rule them all, CÃ¦sar had not been safe. Pollio. Wise men in calmes provide for stormes to come. None knowes how dangerous the times may prove, Though now the state be safe, and may the Gods To CÃ¦sar's honor long preserve it so. Seneca. What new designe is this, that all of them aside. Second so readily, and I was not Acquainted with it? If't prove mischievous, I thanke the Empresse for my ignorance. Agrippina. Burrhus Afranius is a worthy man, Fit for the place, and faithfull, well-belov'd By all the souldiers: such a change, my Lord, None can except against: Let him take all. Seneca. What ere her ends may bee, this proposition For noble Burrhus sake, I must approve. CÃ¦sar. 'Tis true, my love, I make no question Of Burrhus worth, and fitnesse for the place: But what offence have Geta and Crispinus Been e're accus'd of? Or what just suspitions Are there of them? Agrippina. I will not be unjust, To accuse guiltlesse men, although I price Thy safety, CÃ¦sar, equall to my life I know no crimes of note they have committed. Vitellius. CÃ¦sar, it is no losse to them at all; They both have plentious fortunes to retire to. Pollio. And in so neere a cause, who dares examine Great CÃ¦sar's counsells, or enquire the reason? Agrippina. Shall Burrhus have it CÃ¦sar? speake thy pleasure. Or if my care offend, I shall hereafter Forbeare to meddle. CÃ¦sar. No, sweet Agrippina; Since thou wilt have it so; goe Pallas, draw The warrant straight, and seale it in our name: Let Geta and Crispinus be remoov'd, And Burrhus take possession presently. This day, my love, the Britane prisoners Sent from Ostorius Scapula, and late Arriv'd at Rome, shall be in publike shew'd. There thou shalt see that brave Barbarian Prince, That bold Caractacus, whose stubborne spirit So many yeares contemn'd the Roman power. Hee now is taken. Pollio. 'Twas a victory Sent from the Gods to honor Claudius reigne. Agrippina. Had he been basely taken, or at first Yeelded himselfe, as hee had got no honour, But been forgotten in his fall, and nought Had e're been mention'd of him but his death: So had thy glory CÃ¦sar been farre lesse. Vitellius. Not warre-like Syphax the Numidian King, Stubborne Jugurtha, nor great Perseus Ere brought to Rome by their captivity More reall honour then this Britane Prince. CÃ¦sar. Nor doe wee price our name Brittannicus Fetch'd from that Iland, lesse then Scipio His honour'd name of Africanus priz'd. Pollio. Thy stile, O CÃ¦sar, is the greater farre Drawne from the conquest of another world, Which nature ment by enterposing cold And stormy seas, to guard from Latian armes. Vitellius. Great Julius CÃ¦sar did but only shew That land to us, whose conquest was reserv'd By heavens decree to honour Claudius name. Agrippina. CÃ¦sar, let's sit together; one Tribunall Will hold us both. CÃ¦sar. It shall bee so, my love, Thou, as my selfe, shalt pardon or condemne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus II. PoppÃ¦a, Otho. PoppÃ¦a. My love, deare Otho, faine would bid thee stay: But danger now forbids it, for my Lord Returnes by this time homewards from the Pallace. Otho. Wee must obey the times necessity Sweetest PoppÃ¦a, though I part from thee With such a sad'nesse as will loose by all Comparisons, and cannot bee exprest But by it selfe, to say that Otho parts From faire PoppÃ¦a, is more tragicall Then soule from body, honour from a man. PoppÃ¦a. I could, mee thinkes, flatter my feares, to keepe Thee ever heere. Otho. And I can scorne all feares, And dangers too, if thou command mee stay. PoppÃ¦a. No, goe, my Love, and warily let's meete That wee may often meete: but why should still Our highest blisse want freedome? Otho. 'Tis, my faire one, The envy of the Gods, who thinke the state Of men would Ã¦quall theirs, if greatest joyes Were easyest to obtaine, and therfore still In horrid dangers wrap their dearest guifts, As all the PoÃ«ts ancient fables taught. Fire-breathing Buls did guard the Colchian fleece; A waking dragon kept the golden fruit. But thou, PoppÃ¦a, in my thoughts a prize Of greater value, and more lustre farre Then that which drew the bold Thessalian forth So farre from Greece, or made Alcmenaes sonne Invade th'Hesperides, art kept from mee By stronger guards, the awfull Roman lawes, Those lawes resist our love. PoppÃ¦a. Oh where was Otho Then, when my virgin blossome was the hope Of thousand noble youths? hadst thou beene seene PoppÃ¦aes bed and beautyes had beene thine, And with a lawfull uncontrolled flame Had met thy wish in those delights, which now Wee are inforc'd to steale. Otho. Must it bee so. For ever then? PoppÃ¦a. It must while Rufus lives. Otho. Nor can I blame blest Rufus, if hee strive To keepe that wealth, which if it lay beyond The Indian Ganges, Scythian Tanais, Or horned Ammons scorch'd and thirsty sands, Would draw the Roman Monarch to forsake His worlds Imperiall seat there to enjoy, And think those banish'd that remain'd at Rome. If I were CÃ¦sar, and condemn'd by fate To want PoppÃ¦aes love, I should bee poore. No other deare prerogative could that High wreath bestow, but only power to make Thee mine without a rivall: I might then With boldnesse take thee from Crispinus armes. PoppÃ¦a. But could that act bee lawfull? Otho. Canst thou doubt it? Where two loves meete can marriage bee unlawfull? Of which love is the soule, the very forme That gives it being no dead outward ty, But natures strong and inward sympathy. Can make a marriage, which the Gods alone Have power to breede in us, and therfore they Have only power to ty so sweete a knot. I am thy mate; nor did thy father, when Hee gave that snowy hand unto another, Ought but rebell against the Gods decree. PoppÃ¦a. Thou art to good an advocate, and I Too partiall for a judge. Otho. Bee constant to mee Till fortune give a bolder priviledge. And warrant to our love, of which I have Receiv'd such faire presages, as I cannot Despaire; meane while by stealth I must behold Those starry eyes, and think my selfe most happy In that, though no man know my happinesse. PoppÃ¦a. Can men count those delights a happinesse Which they conceale? Otho. Yes, those that truly love. Enter Fulvia. Fulvia. Madam, my Lord is come. PoppÃ¦a. Farewell deare Otho. Otho. Farewell: love guard thee till wee meete againe. exit. Enter Crispinus, Geta. Crispinus. Come Lucius study to forget it now, And let's bee truly merry; my PoppÃ¦a Bid' Lucius Geta welcome, my colleague That was, but still my frend. PoppÃ¦a. You are most welcome. Geta. Thankes fairest Lady. PoppÃ¦a. But my Lord, what meanes That speech of yours, that Lucius Geta once Was your colleague and is not. Crispinus. I'l tell thee, Great Agrippina has commanded CÃ¦sar To command Pallas to command us two. To quit our charge and suddainly resigne The governement of the PrÃ¦torian campe To Burrhus hand; at which hee stormes; but I Am merryer farre, and lighter then before. Wee may live freely now; CÃ¦sar has tane A weighty burthen from my weary necke I thanke his goodnesse. Geta. Thanke his sottishnesse, Tis that has pleasured you. ah frend it needes Must grieve all noble hearts, that can love justice, And pity suffring innocence, to see The harmelesse yeares of young Britannicus Expos'd to all the malice of his foes, And stupid CÃ¦sar made the instrument To ruine his owne sonne: whilest his great power By others is abus'd against himselfe And his posterity. Crispinus. I do beleive it. Geta. His servants all, that to himselfe were true, Or faithfull to his sonne, are murther'd now, Or else displac'd by her: our truth's the cause That wee have lost our places. Crispinus. Tis no matter; Wee loose no honour by our truth; and since While wee had power, wee faithfully discharg'd Our trust to CÃ¦sar, let's no longer stirve To guard him 'gainst his will; but take his gift. Hee gives us ease, and freedome, to retire, And tast the sweetes of privaty, and there Enjoy our lives free from the glorious noise, And troubles of a Court; instead of waiting On CÃ¦sar now, on thee I will bestow That time, my faire PoppÃ¦a, and attend On thy delights; thou wilt not cast mee off As CÃ¦sar does. Fulvia. Shee cannot promise you I know her heart better then you in that. Crispinus. None can describe the sweetes of countrey life But those blest men that do enjoy, and tast them. Plaine husband men, though farre below our pitch Of fortune plac'd, enjoy a wealth above us. To whome the earth with true and bountious justice Free from warres cares returnes an easy food. They breath the fresh and uncorrupted aire, And by cleare brookes enjoy untroubled sleepes. Their state is fearlesse, and secure, enrich'd With severall blessings, such as greatest Kings Might in true justice envy, and themselves Would count too happy, if they truly knew them. Geta. Tis true, Crispinus, greatest Monarchs oft Have in the midst of all theyr carefull gloryes Desir'd such lives as those plaine people lead. Crispinus. Let us enjoy that huppinesse then Lucius The countrey sports and recreations And friends as innocent as wee, with whom Wee need not feare the strength of richest wine In drawing out our secrets: but well fill'd At suppertime may hold a free discourse Of CÃ¦sar's weakenesse, of the wealth and pride Of his freed'men, how lordly Pallas rules; How feirce and cruell Arippina is, What slaves the Roman Senate are become, And yet next morne awake with confidence. PoppÃ¦a. All this, my Lord, you may discourse at Rome If you can wisely choose your company. Crispinus. Well said PoppÃ¦a, thou art a woman right Thou lov'st the city well. Geta. I cannot blame her, Such beauty seekes no corners, but may well Become th'Imperiall city of the world. Crispinus. Come Lucius Geta, let's goe in and laugh At our proud enemyes, enjoy theire malice, And drowne our cares in rich Falernian wine As ancient as Opimius Consulship. Enter to them Narcissus. Geta. Here comes a man, Crispinus, I beleive Is sory for this change. Crispinus. I thinke so Lucius. Narcissus. Haile noble Romans. Crispinus. Haile to you Narcissus. How dare you venture a salute on us, Or make a visite to such guilty men? Narcissus. Guilty my Lord, in what? Crispinus. In beeing wrong'd. Those that are wrong'd in Court, are made offendours, Narcissus. I must confesse, my Lord, it was a wrong To you and your Colleague to bee displac'd, But you have spirits great enough to scorne That injury, and pity him that did it, I meane that suffer'd his proud foes to doo it Rather against himselfe then you; the wrong Must fall on CÃ¦sar, and his haplesse house. Blinded by fate, and neere his fall, hee throwes Away the best supporters of his state. Geta. The thought of that as I am true, Narcissus, Afflicts mee more then mine owne losse can doe. Crispinus. For mee, I thinke my selfe well free'd from trouble Were't not for feare of poore Britannicus. Narcissus. I doo beleeve it, noble Lords; but you Are now dischar'gd, and may retire with safety. My part is yet to play, a part of danger, And I will act it bravely: here I vow By all the Gods, no feare shall make mee shrinke Till I have once more righted Claudius Against the lusts and treasons of a wife. Nor do I boast of Messalinaes death. It was the times necessity, that made Mee then to shew my power: that power perchance Is yet as much; nor shall the Lordly Pallas, Though swell'd with Agrippinaes lustfull favours, And back'd by her authority, hee thinke Himselfe sole ruler in th'Imperiall house, Finde that Narcissus is so fall'n in spirit But that I dare attempt as much as then. Great CÃ¦sar's safety is as much in danger As then it was, his nuptiall bed as stain'd, And I will dy, or take the same revenge, That then was taken; all their plots and treasons Will I reveale to CÃ¦sar, and pursue it With such a dauntlesse constancy, that if The Gods forget not to bee just, this day Proud Agrippina, and her minion fall. The young Britannicus shall stand secure In his high birthright; Messalinaes ghost Shall then perchance, although shee hate mee now, Forgive the hand that caus'd her overthrow, Geta. Bravely resolu'd, Narcissus. Crispinus. You shall doe An act that all good men shall thank you for. Will you goe in, and tast my wine. Narcissus. Not now. I came but only to reveale my purpose To you, whose noble wishes may befriend it, And when occasion serves, may truly witnesse My just intents; this hower I am expected By CÃ¦sar in his gardens; there I'll put My life upon the hazard; every minute May breede a change, and all delayes have danger. For CÃ¦sar upon those discoveryes That I already have made to him, utter'd Some words last night at supper in his wine. Of which I feare that Agrippina tooke Too great a notice; therfore speede must helpe us. Farewell my Lords. Ambo. Farewell: the Gods assist thee. Exeunt. Otho. Otho. So rich a bondage is PoppÃ¦as love, That I were base if I should wish for freedome, Nay more, ingrate, should I desire to change So sweete a care for quietnesse it selfe; Should I suppose that state, which some dull soules Call calme content, were halfe so rich, so free As are these pinings, this captivity. Were there in love no cares, no sighs, no feares, There were in love no happinesse at all. What blisse, what wealth did e're the world bestow On man, but cares and feares attended it? Yet who so base, as, to bee freed from those, Would throw away the highest blisse on earth? Let silly shipheards, whose poore narrow soules Not much exceede the beasts they tend and feede, That know, like them, no farther regions Then some few feilds, no larger bounds of pleasure Then satisfaction of bare natures needes, Bee still secure since they have nought to loose, And rest content because they never knew What cityes were, and gorgeous Pallaces. Should Monarchs, who are taught to know th'extent Of natures wealth, and what the world affords, Forgoe their glorious fortunes, cause they want That wretched thing, which only ignorance, And low contempt can give, Security? Should I forgoe my faire PoppÃ¦aes love Because some cares, some feares, and sighs attend it: When every smile of hers can recompence A thousand such? were too much poorenesse in mee Had I nere seene those starry eyes of hers More haplesse farre my ignorance had beene. I had, like wretched men, that are borne blinde, Nere knowne there was a Sunne to guild the world. But to injoy her love without all feares, Without all rivalls, were a blisse beyond Mortality: the Gods would envy mee. Shee's now another mans: that may bee thought The greatest barre to Otho's happinesse. But I have framed in my jealous thoughts A greater barre then that: young Nero CÃ¦sar, In whose acquaintance I of late have found So neere a roome, as faire presages tell us, Is like to weareth' Imperiall wreath: his power May take her for mee from Crispinus armes. But then perchance I loose her more then ever. Or should hee see her now to rivall mee T'were undone: hee's amorous, and oft Sollicites mee to let him see my Mistres. I for that frendship, which I dare not loose, Dare not deny his importunity. And therfore to prevent what may ensue For yet hee never heard PoppÃ¦as name) I have made love to the faire freed woman Young Acte of meane ranke, but such a face, As whosoever had not seene PoppÃ¦a Would thinke this Acte natures Masterpeice. On her will I divert young Nero's love. And to that purpose I have got her picture. But here hee comes. Enter Nero. Nero. What Otbo, still retir'd? Where lives the face that breedes this melancholy? There is no other cause can doe't: I know Thou art not busy'd with affaires of state. I prithee let mee see her: a friends counsell I say ease thy passion. Otho. Tis not fit a Prince Should stoope so low as to the passions Of privatemen. Noro. The name of friend admits Of no such distance. Otho. A no man, whom you Are pleas'd to call a friend, deserves that name, Unlesse hee know himselfe to bee your servant. Nero. Come prithee leave thy fooling, and bee plaine. Where there is no familiarity Society is lost: why art thou fearfull To let mee see her whosoere shee bee? Otho. Sr. I could give you a plaine common reason, If shee bee foule, shee is not worth your sight. If faire, you are too great a rivall for mee. But yet, know Sr. I am so free from those Unworthy feares, that I dare trust my life, My love, and all I have into your hands. Nero. Spoke like a friend, and thou maist safely doo't. Then first behold her picture, and by that Find whether shee bee worth the sight or no. Nero. Can any mortall beauty bee so sweete? Otho. I would there were not. Nero. Sure the painter flatters. Otho. Oh no, hee had not art enough to reach The glory of it; were the substance here How dull would this now lovely table show! See how his greedy eyes devoure the picture. Hee's caught, hee's caught; Cupid' I thanke thee now. Nero. I never saw true beauty till this houre. But wherfore didst thou wish there were no substance So sweete as this? why would'st thou bee depriv'd Of such a happinesse? but I perceive It is thy feare: come, let it not bee so. I but desire to see whether the painter Have err'd or no: and do not thinke, my Otho, That I will wrong thy love so much, or make My wife Octavia jealous. Otho. Sr. how ere, My life, my love, and fortunes all are yours. Exeunt. Claudius, Narcissus. Narcissus. Your Majesty may yet prevent it all, And justly throw upon the Traitors heads That ruine which so boldly threatens you, And your too much abused family. Yet CÃ¦sar may bee safe, if hee will use That power the Gods have put into his hands. CÃ¦sar. That course, Narcissus, can wee run, to make The people sensible of our estate, That danger threatens us, and how our Justice Is forc'd to meete the treasons of a wife? Narcissus. Yet not too vaine a care of popular breath, Or what the Vulgar may surmise, outweigh The safety of youre person, and youre house. But I am most assur'd that all the world Except youre selfe, have long observ'd theire plots, And if they see your waken'd Justice now Arise to censure Agrippinaes death, They will not thinke the execution done Too soone on her: these humble knees, Oh CÃ¦sar. Which for your safety I so oft have bow'd Before the Gods, now to your sacred selfe I bow, entreating that you would bee safe, And not beleeve the Gods by miracle Will worke for you, whilest you neglect your selfe. CÃ¦sar. Arise Narcissus, tis th'unhappy fate Of Princes ever (as Augustus CÃ¦sar Was wont to say) the people ne're beleeve That treasons were complotted 'gainst theire persons Untill those treasons take effect, and then Too late perchance they pity and beleeve. Narcissus. But was the wise Augustus therfore slow Or timorous to cut offenders off? Fear'd hee the peoples whispers? CÃ¦sar, no. Hee well knew to use the sword hee had. Hee had not else liv'd till times gentle hand Dissolv'd in peace his long felicity, And made the world by such continuance Of power, beleeve hee was a God on earth. CÃ¦sar. But some offendours are too great to suffer The common course of Justice: against such Wise Princes have forborne to draw the sword, And rather sought some wayes of policy How to ensnare them. Narcissus. CÃ¦sar, those are wayes As much unfit for Princes as unsafe. As many Monarchs have in dangerous times Beene ruin'd quite by going wayes too low (Though they have seemed subtle) as proud subjects Have beene undone by playing Princes parts. And as this high, and open way befits The power and person of earths greatest Monarch: So it befits the times necessity. You have already, CÃ¦sar, shew'd your sword, And if you strike not now, you do not right Your selfe at all, but only arme your foes With plots of mischeife to prevent their owne, And hasten on your quicke destruction. You have already threaten'd, and those speeches By Agrippina, and her minion Pallas Were overheard; who, like seene snakes will now Bestirre themselves in a more desperate fury. I have already cast mine owne poore life Into the utmost hazard; but alas! That is a thing not now considerable. The Gods above can tell how willingly For CÃ¦sar's safety I would sacrifice This life; make mee the cheifest instrument Impose what part of this exploit you please Upon Narcissus hand, and if I faile To execute, I'll not refuse to dy. CÃ¦sar. Oh my Narcissus; I have found thy faith In other services: it is resolv'd, Their pride shall feele my justice; thou shalt see How soone I will secure my self and thee. Exeunt. Agrippina, Pallas. Agrippina. Wee are discover'd Pallas: all our drifts Are sounded by Narcissus, and by him Lay'd ope to CÃ¦sar, who dissembling yet The knowledge of it, seekes a suddaine way To ruine both of us: nor had wee fear'd So soone as felt his fury, had not wine Betray'd his thoughts to us; you know last night What speeches CÃ¦sar in his drunkennesse Let fall before us; and twas lately told mee That meeting young Britannicus hee wept, Confest that hee had wrong'd him, and there vow'd A quicke redresse: what counsell shall wee take? Pallas. Wee have no time for counsell: but must act As soone as thinke: wee goe not now to worke But to prevent a mischeife, and our cure Must bee as strong, and quicke of operation As our disease is dangerous and suddaine. That bird, that sees the snare, and will be caught Deserves his death: and since that CÃ¦sar knowes His purpose is discover'd (as Narcissus Ha's before this inform'd him that wee heard it) Hee'l quickly act what else hee had deferr'd. No way is left us but to meete the danger, And for prevention first attempt to doe That which wee feare to suffer. Agrippina. By what meanes Shall wee procure his death? for poison slow Perchance may faile to lend a timely helpe Unto our safety; and too quicke a venome May make the fact supected. Pallas. Should the fact Bee nere so much suspected, your estate Would bee more safe then now it is; but who Would dare to utter it when CÃ¦sar's dead, And your owne Sonne the Emperour: for so My confidence assures mee it will bee. Therfore bee speedy, Madam; for your danger Where fame, where life, and Empire all are threaten'd, Gives you no nice election. So 't bee done No matter how. Agrippina. Thou hast confirm'd mee, Pallas. The way's resolv'd already; there were lately The fairest mushromes sent from Lybia That ere these eyes beheld, a meat which hee Affects with greedinesse; in one of those CÃ¦sar shall meete his death; if that should faile His cheife Physitian Xenophon is mine. But are things stong, and ready to confirme The Empire upon Nero. Pallas. Tis the best And happiest time, before Britannicus Bee growne to riper yeares, while yet hee weares His childish robe, and Nero has beene showne To all the people in triumphall weedes. But when the deed is done, place warily Your guards about the Pallace gates, and keepe Britannicus within; whilest Nero back'd By Seneca and Burrhus, by the campe And Senate bee saluted Emperour, And all be setled sure. Agrippina. How fit a time To work his own destruction CÃ¦sar chose To tempt with threatning Agrippinas fury!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus III. Scena. I. Petronius, Otho, Montanus. Petronius. Is Nero fir'd? Otho. Extremly. I at first Seem'd melancholy to loose Acte so, And hee seem'd loath to wrong mee; but at last When his desires were high, I cunningly Withdrew my interest, and gave way to his. Which hee has taken for the greatest favour That ever man could doe him and I hope It has endear'd him strongly. Montanus. Thou wilt grow A happy man. Petronius. Tis the best way to rise. The wench is faire, and of behaviour Wanton enough to make the arrantst novice A perfect scholler in the schoole of Venus. Seneca himselfe rather will give way That hee should satisfie his lust on her Then seeke th'adulteries of noble women. Montanus. But gentlemen, have you not heard the newes? There is a great combustion in the Palace As I have been inform'd theeves, are fall'n out. The two proud freemen Pallas and Narcissus Are clashing 'gainst each other. Petronius. I am glad ont. I hope some curious rogeries will come on't. Those are the fellowes that have rul'd the state These many yeeres, and trampled on the lives Of noble men CÃ¦sar's credulous weakenesse. But yet mee thinks Narcissus should not dare Not to contest with Pallas he has got Too great a start of him, and is too neere Acquainted with the empresse. Montanus. So they say. Otho. Has a fine time on't who would think the rogue Sould bee so ambitious as to court an Empresse? Petronius. 'Twas her ambitions to bee made the wife Of Claudius, that first made her prostitute Her selfe so low, and court this fellows love, Whom she perceiv'd to have a ruling power Over his doating master, to ambition Shee sacrific'd her honour tis well known. Montanus. And hee by dooing of the Empresse, takes The surest way of keeping CÃ¦sars love. Petronius. Yes, there's no doubt of that. You know the proverbe. Enter to then Anicetus. Anicetus. Well met my Lords; I come to finde you out. Otho. What's the newes Anicetus? Anicetus. Great my Lord. CÃ¦sar, is wondrous sick; 'tis thought to death. The Pallas is by souldiers guarded round. A great and frequent Senate is assembling. The Consuls and the Priests are making vowes For CÃ¦sar's safety. Montanus. Claudius is old Petronius. There have been other wayes to end a Prince Besides old age. But what is that to us? Come let's away and shew our forwardnesse To joy or mourning as occasion serves. I am prepar'd for both. Montanus. And so am I. Otho. Both must be done, if CÃ¦sar dye, our greife Must last but till the successor bee known; And then wee must rejoyce. Petronius. Tis true. Otho. But I Shall have true cause of joy if Nero reigne, Exeunt. Britannicus, Octavia, Xenophon. Britannicus. Shall I not see my father ere hee dy? Octavia. Good Xenophon. Xenophon. Good Madam pardon mee, Nothing is now so great an enemy To his disease as noise and company. Hee's lately fall'n into a gentle slumber. Deep sleeps his feaver will not let him take. I'll certify your highnesse when hee wakes. And wait upon you. Octavia. Thankes good Xenophon. Exeunt. Agrippina. Agrippina. I long to heare what favour Nero findes In the Pretorian campe, how CÃ¦sar's death Is by the souldiers and the Senate taken. Enter Pallas. Welcome my dearest Pallas What's the newes? Pallas. Madam, as good as Jove himselfe could send, No sooner in the campe was CÃ¦sar's death Divulgd, but Burrhus enters to his charge, And Nero with him, who by all the cohorts Was presently saluted Emperour. Only some few were silent, and a while Stood still expecting young Britannicus; But when they saw their expectation Was all in vaine, and none but Nero came, Fearing at last to loose the Donative Which Burrhus promis'd them in Neros name, They joyn'd themselves unto the greater part. Agrippina. Britannicus within the Pallace here Is safe enough for comming forth to day. The Senate have scarse heard of CÃ¦sar's death For wee conceal'd it till all things were ready. Pallas. Now in a Princely chariot mounted high Guarded by Burrhus and the souldiers Nero sets forward to the Senate house. But having past the campe, you need not feare The Senate, Madam. Agrippina. Pallas thou wert never A messenger of lucky newes to mee. A safe contriver of the highest plots, A happy instrument thou hast deserv'd What ere thou hast enjoy'd, though thou have tasted That which a CÃ¦sar su'd to tast, and bought The world in recompence. Pallas. If ever Pallas Had any fire that could advance his thoughts To high and great exploits, hee kindled it At your cÃ¦lestiall beauty, as from heaven Prometheus stole that active fire, by which Hee durst himself adventure to create The noblest creature man. What act on earth, What undertaking should he tremble at Whom Agrippinas favours animate? And what had I been but a peece of earth Cold, dull, and uselesse, had I not been quickn'd By your Ã¦theriall touch. Agrippina. The happinesse Of this high day has made thee eloquent Pallas. The love of royall Agrippina can Inspire the dullest Soule with life and language. When the Idalian Queene was pleas'd to grace A shepheards boy more then his humble thoughts Could hope or wish, the ravish'd tongue forgot That rurall language which before it us'd. Agrippina. Ah Pallas what a glorious change is here! How is the lownesse of our late despaire Turn'd to the height of joy and happinesse? Pallas. Quicke resolution well purfu'd will cure The saddest state. Agrippina. Goe thou and heare more newes, Whilest I dispose of things about the Palace Exeunt. A Senate, Pollio Consul, Vitellius, Seneca, Otho, Petronius, Montanus. Pollio. May all the Gods accept our sacrifice, And bee propitious to the vowes, that wee Have vow'd for CÃ¦sar's safety. Vitellius. Let the great Divine and sacred Nero Claudius The care of heaven, sole ruler of the earth, And Romes high Father not forsake his world So soone t'encrease the number of the Gods, Enter Burrhus. Burrhus. Haile to the Consul, and this sacred Senate. Great Claudius CÃ¦sar's dead, in whose high throne With one consent the souldiers have agreed To seat young Nero his adopted sonne; And do by mee entreat your suffrages Fathers conscript; to ratifie their choice. Seneca. Let not young Nero's yeeres disparage him, Nor trouble you, since happy presidents May well be showne, grave Fathers. Great Augustus Of glorious memory, no more in debt To yeeres then hee began to rule the state, With what successe not one in all this noble And great assembly can bee ignorant. But weigh with mee the difference of the times. The state is setled, and has flourish'd long In peacefull government; no civill rents. No factions now, nor armies are a foot To staine with Latian blood Philippi plaines, To dye the Actiak and Sicilian Seas, And through all regions beare th'unnaturall wounds Of bleeding Rome. No such affrighting names As Marcus Brutus, Cassius, Lepidus. Great Pompey's sonne, or feirce Antonius Arm'd with the power of halfe the Roman world Stand to oppose him. Oh yee Gods how great! How many dangers had beset the state When young Augustus mannag'd it! yet hee Withstood and vanquish'd all those difficulties. And why should Nero our elected Prince Ag'd like Augustus, not bee able now To sway a peacefull scepter? for the right To this high, wreath although Britannicus Were borne the naturall sonne of Claudius, A Prince of hope enough, and may by some Bee thought much wrong'd in this election, Yet weigh it rightly, and no wrong is done. For Nero was adopted. But besides The claime of his adoption, hee is borne A truer heire to our Imperiall house Sprung up from the loines of great Augustus CÃ¦sar. Britannicus from Liviaes sonnes alone. Vitellius. Nor are the yeeres of young Britannicus So ripe as his to govern. Pollio. Seneca, Has wisely shewed his undoubted right, And I with joy approve the souldiers choise. Octavia. The Gods preserve Nero our Emperour. Otho. Now is the height of all my wishes reach'd. Enter Nero with Tribune. Tribune. Roome for CÃ¦sar. Hee goes on, and takes his state. Pollio. Haile Nero CÃ¦sar. Seneca. Haile great Emperour. Vitellius. Ever Augustus. Otho. Most invincible Petronius. Most sacred Tribune Montanus. Holyest highest Priest. Pollio. Father of Rome Nero. That honorable title Is yet too weighty for my tender yeeres. Then let mee weare it, fathers, when my paines My toile and travell for the publike weale By ayde and favour of the Gods have made Mee worthy of it. But your free consent Fathers conscript, your powerfull suffrages Powerfull and honor'd as the voice of heaven In confirmation of the souldiers choise Fils mee with joy immortall, and shall binde My best indeavours to requite that love. My heart is cleare, my education Was not in factious, in tumultuous times, Or civil broiles, my former life has been As free from doing as receiving wrong; And therefore bring I to th'Imperiall Throne. No feares, no grudges, hatred or reveneg. This sacred Senate, which the world adores, Shall still retaine her old prerogative While Nero lives. My privat house affayres Shall from the free Republicke bee divided, And never turne the course of common Justice. No publike Office shall bee bought for gold. The sacred Consulary power shall judge As heretofore, th'affaires of Italy And forreigne provinces. My care alone Sall bee to rule and lead the Souldiers. And such to all the people will I bee As I would wish th'immortall Gods to mee. Vitellius. Oh speech most worthy Jupiter himselfe! Worthy for ever to be registed In brazen Pillars for the world to read. Pollio. Let publike thanks by Senate bee decreed To CÃ¦sar's grace and goodnesse. Nero. No Asinius, Let me deserve them first, first give me leave What I have promis'd to performe in deedes, That then if thankes or praises bee bestow'd They my bee judg'd as due, and better Crowne Your owne true justice, and the Princes merits. Pollio. Oh happy Rome in such an Emperour! Long may hee reigne on earth, and late, oh late Become a gloroius starre in Heaven Tribune. What word. Will CÃ¦sar give the watching souldiers? Nero. The excellent mother, Tribune, is their word. Your company, noble Consul, wee'll entreate Home to the Pallace. Pollio. I'll attend on CÃ¦sar. Exeunt. Manent Otho, Petronius, Montanus. Montanus. The Prince has promis'd faire: Petronius. Else Seneca, That made the speech for him had been too blame. Otho. Well, let him speake as Seneca instructs In publicke still say I, I know his heart And secret thoughts better then Seneca Shall ever doe; and there are Joviall dayes A comming, gallants, say I prophecy. Montanus. Will it bee lawfull to eat Lybian mushroms, And British oysters without being cited Before the censor? Otho. Yes Curtius, and to whore For vacuation after them; those gifts Will bee Court vertues. Come, the Prince is hopefull. Petronius. Would I might have the bringing of him up. Otho. If I can helpe it, thou shalt have a share In his tuition. Welcome Anicetus, Anicetus Is it to mee you come? Anicetus. To you, my Lord. CÃ¦sar desires your company at the pallace. Otho. CÃ¦sars desire, is a command, which I With joy obey, returne my humble duty Good Anicetus, I'll attend him strait. Exit Anicetus. Otho. Now my mad shavers, do you know me yet? Petronius. Yes, very well; the question is if thou Wilt know us now. Otho. Tut man, Nero shall know you. I'll bring you both into his neare acquaintance. Now faire PoppÃ¦a's mine and mine alone. CÃ¦sar must grant my first petition, Or else deny the love hee swore to mee If ere hee wore the worlds Imperiall wreath. His power must fetch PoppÃ¦a from her husband. Nor is the deed so envious. Other Princes Have done the like, and yet not tax'd in story. Petronius. Besides, hee knowes Crispinus never lov'd him, And was an enemy to his adoption. 'Gainst him perchance hee will the sooner grant it. Exeunt Agrip. This is the day that sets a glorious Crown On all my great designes this day declares My power, and makes the trembling world to know That Agrippina. only can bestow The Roman Empire, and command the wheel Of suffring Fortune, holding in her hand The fate of nation. Is there not a name Above Augusta to enforme the world How great I am? What Roman Deity Shall I assume? the petty Goddesses Would all resigne; but that they blushing think Their stiles and altars are too meane for mee. Lacinion Juno shall bee proud to share Her gloryes all with mee, and think her power Grac'd with my fellowship would brighter shine; Or leave her name, and bee ador'd by mine. Enter Nero, PolliÃ², Seneca, Burrhus. My Nero is return'd, haile Nero CÃ¦sar. Nero. Haile great and deare Augusta, best of Mothers. To whose sole care and goodnesse CÃ¦sar owes All those rich honours that he weares to day, And will ackowledge ever Agrippina. Brighter still For many yeeres let this blest day returne, That does bestow for my deare Lord and husband The ne're-enough lamented Claudius So true a solace on my greiv'd Soule. This is that CÃ¦sar now, on whom my hopes And comforts all rely. Nero. This is that CÃ¦sar. Who in obedience and true filiall love To Agrippina will for ever strive With vertuous Ã¦mulation to excell Her most admir'd and exemplary goodnesse. Pollio. How well this piety becomes them both. Pallas. Enter Pallas Long live great Nero CÃ¦sar. Nero. Thankes good Pallas. Wee are indebted to thy faithfull service; And therefore till wee finde some greater meanes To make requitall, still retaine that office Which in our father Claudius time thou held'st. Bee still our steward of th'Emperiall house. Agrippina. Hee has deserv'd it. Nero. For the funerals Of our dead father, in what state and order They shall bee celebrated, wee refer To you deare Mother. Agrippina. Let the order of them Bee like Augustus CÃ¦sar's. Let him have A Censors funeralls with divine honours, And put among the number of the Gods. Nor shall our grandmother great Livia With her Tiberius to Augustus show More piety, or more magnificence Then wee to our divinest Claudius. Exeunt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus IIII. Narcissus, Geta. Narcissus. If wee bee bound to think the Gods consider This humane world, why are wee not as well Bound to beleeve the greatest members of it On whom the fates of all the rest depend, Should be their greatest care? why should the Gods Extend their narrow providence, and show Their power in woods and rurall villages, Yet thinke th'Imperiall family of Rome Not worth their care at all? for if they had Where slept their justice, when great Claudius Was murdred by his servants and his wife, And they ador'd, and honour'd by the state For acting that accursed deed! what right Can all the subject world receive from thence! What good can dwell upon the earth with safety? Proud Pallas, thou hast got the victory O're poore Narcissus, and mayest safely triumph With thy false Empresse; for no law can reach The height you soare at now but yet take heed That very crime, the same Impiety That aided you in your foule enterprise To vanquish mee and justice on my side, May one day pull you downe. Geta. Alas Narcissus! Too truly Rufus, thou, and I foresaw This fatall storme 'gainst Claudius wofull house. Britannicus is now the object growne Of all mens piety. Narcissus. In the wrong hee did Unto his hopefull sonne hee needs must see His own destruction woven. But if Claudius, When I detected all their plots to him, Had beene of nature quick and resolute Hee had prevented all, and scap'd his murder. Tis certaine hee was poison'd Geta. Rome it selfe I feare will rue that sad adoption, And in the wrongs of young Britannicus Will beare too deepe a share. while the firce rule Of Agrippina lasts. Narcissus. What better hope Does Nero promise us? Those that are neere, Xiphilin And inward with his nature, doe suspect In him all seedes of vice and tyranny, Though smoother'd for a time, at least, not hurtfull While he refraines from medling with the state That his night rambling revels, drinking feasts, And cruell sports that he's delighted in, Are vices of his nature, not his youth. Geta: Tis true, Narcissus, I of late have heard Many beginne to feare the prophecy of Aenobarbus his detested sire Xiphilin. That nothing good could be begot twixt him And Agrippina. Too too true alas! Such prophecies of some of our late Princes Have prov'd to Rome, as that Augustus made Of the slow-jaw'd Tiberius, and Tiberius Of his successour Caius, whom hee nam'd A PhaÃ«ton to the unhappy world. Narcissus. All that I hope for is a wretched life, If that bee not too much for mee to hope. Into Campania will I go, but there If death pursue mee, CÃ¦sars armes are long, And I am arm'd for any accident. Let none, but with a spirit prepar'd to dye, Dare to adventure on prosperity. Geta. Rufus and I are both resolv'd to leave The city too, wee are not safe within it. But farre perchance, removed from her sight Wee may escape fell Agrippinas spight. Enter to them Crispinus. Crispinus. Ah Lucius Geta, I am now enforc'd To that retirement, which wee lately talk'd of. Because my danger mov'd mee not before, Fresh cause is giv'n mee. Now I would not breath The aire of Rome for all the wealth within it. Geta. What cause is that Crispinus? speake Crispinus. PoppÃ¦a, That was my wife is carried from my house, And divoc'd from mee by command from CÃ¦sar, Narcissus. The Prince begins his reigne most hopefully. Crispinus. Do you not wonder how I beare it thus? Geta. I must confesse the losse is wondrous great. Crispinus. True, had shee been my chast and faithfull wife, The losse had been beyond all Ã¦stimation. Nor could a manly spirit have borne the wrong. But shee was none of mine, her heart, my Lucius. As I have since discover'd, long ago Was given to wanton Otho, and with him Tis thought she stole her close adulterous houres. For on that Otho, Nero has bestow'd her. Xiphilin ex Dione Wanting her heart, that gawdy peice of Earth That men call beauty, I should soone have scorn'd, Though CÃ¦sar's warrant had not come at all. Shall wee be gone, my freind? Geta. With all my heart. It was my feare PoppÃ¦a would have caus'd Your stay too long. Crispinus. I'll put her from my thoughts. Narcissus. Farewell my Lords, all happinesse attend Your Country life, though I can hope for none. Crispinus. Farewell Narcissus may the Gods protect thee. Exeunt. Otho, PoppÃ¦a. Otho, Thus greatest Monarchs oft have given away What they themselves ne're saw, nor e're knew how To value truely. Nero has bestow'd A guift unknown on mee, which I, that taste How sweet it is, would not againe forgo For all his Empires wealth. PoppÃ¦a. Nor would I change My Otho's love for great Augustus state. Otho. There to enjoy where both extreamly love Is such a happines (as I have heard Some do observe) it seldome does befall A marryed paire, or if it doe, that blisse Endures not long, so envious are the fates. But that's a dreame, my love, I doe not feare. PoppÃ¦a. Thou need'st not feare PoppÃ¦as constancy Though CÃ¦sar were thy rivall, Otho. Sweet I do not; I dare not wrong thy truth, or take so much From mine own happinesse, as to suspect Thy constant minde at all: but CÃ¦sar's power Is of extent as large as mans desire. 'Twas that, that made thee mine; and nought but that That gave, can take my happinesse away. Thou hast a face, PoppÃ¦a, that would cleare A ravisher from guilt, that would excuse The treason of a freind, and make my wrong No staine to CÃ¦sar's honour, though the Gods, Or Cato were his judges. PoppÃ¦a. CÃ¦sar would not; Hee loves the well besides a noble minde Would scorne to taste the fruites of forced love, Otho. A long beseidging is as forcible As an assault, and wins the fort as sure Though not so soone. PoppÃ¦a. Nay spare your arguments. I can looke through them; thou art fearfull, Otho, That I should long to see the Court: alas I have no such ambition to bee known To Agrippina or Octavia. Otho. Mistake mee not, sweete love, I am so farre From jealousy of thee, that 'twas my purpose To make it my request that thou would'st go And see great CÃ¦sar's Court: nor do I thinke Octavia would bee jealous, or that danger That once befell the faire Calphurnia, Whom Agrippina banish'd Italy Because that Claudius CÃ¦sar prais'd her beauty, Should fall on thee. PoppÃ¦a. It shall not fall on mee, I will noe see the Court: fy Otho fy How wretchedly in striving to conceale Thy jelousy, thou dost betray it to mee! Why dost thou tell mee so of CÃ¦sar's power, Octaviaes wrath, Calphuniaes banishment Through Agrippinaes envy? tis thy love Better then all these subtle tricks will keepe My thoughts at home. Otho. It shall appeare to thee I do not feare at all; or if I did, Tis not the failing of thy constancy. Enjoy what freedome thou desir'st, PoppÃ¦a. Now for a little while excuse my absence, I must for sake thee, though unwillingly. CÃ¦sar, I feare, expected my return Long before this love has beguil'd the time, And made my stay seeme shorter then it is. But I shall think till I returne againe The houres are long, till then farewell PoppÃ¦a. Exit. PoppÃ¦a. I finde his feares alreadie, my estate Was better farre before Rufus Crispinus Was grave and knew not wantonnesse enough To make him jealous as this Otho does That too unlawfull love, which then I shew'd To Otho, is the mother of these feares. Is old Seleucus the Magician come; Enter Fulvia Fulvia: Madam hee waites without, PoppÃ¦a. Go call him hither. Seleucus is the master of his Art. All his prÃ¦dictions hitherto have prov'd Most true and certaine. why should I desire To know my future fate; and hasten woe (Should it prove ill) before the time of woe? But tis a longing that I cannot check Enter Seleucus. Welcom Seleucus, have you found it out? Seleucus. Madam, your scheme is drawn, and there I finde The stars alot another husband to you PoppÃ¦a. Another after Otho? Seleucus. Yes, a third. PoppÃ¦a. What shall hee bee? Seleucus. The greatest Prince on earth. PoppÃ¦a. Ha, CÃ¦sar? Seleucus. Yes; it must be CÃ¦sar, Madam. And tis as true as if the oracles Of Jove and PhÅbus had foretold it both. PoppÃ¦a. This CÃ¦sar that now lives? Seleucus. I can no further Instruct you Madam; what you heare is true. PoppÃ¦a. Drinke this Seleucus for my sake. Farewell. Exit Seleucus To bee Augusta is the greatest gift The fates can give; nor does it seems to mee A thing so much unlikely. Otho's feare Perchance was fatall. If it were, in vaine His care will bee, nor can hee then accuse Mee, but the fates that overrul'd my love. Agrippina, Pallas. Agrippina. It is decreed, Silanus must not live. Th'Imperial blood, that runs within his veines Were there no other cause, is crime enough. Hee is descended in the same degree That Nero is from great Augustus loines. And some have lately whisper'd that his age Is more mature for soveraignty then Nero's. Besides thou know'st his brother Lucius, That should have marryed young Octavia, By us was hunted to his death; and hee May meditate revenge. Pallas. You need not feare A spirit so sluggish as Silanus is. Your brother Caius CÃ¦sar, in the midd'st Of all his feares and jealousyes to which Hee sacrific'd so many noble branches Of your Imperiall house, contemn'd Silanus Is one in whom there was no spirit, or danger, And call'd him nothing but the golden beast. Agrippina. Wee cannot tell, if times of trouble come, How much that beast by courage of attendants And confluence of souldiers may bee chang'd. Hee is Proconsul now of Asia, And may here after, if the people should Maligne our government, bring power against us. Pallas. If you will have it so Publius Celerius And Aelius now going for Asia Have undertaken there to poison him. Agrippina. Let it bee done. But Pallas, first of all Let a centurion bee dispach'd into Campania, to kill Narcissus. there Xiphilin. Hee must not live, that did contrive our ruine And knowes, I feare, the meanes by which wee scap'd it By our command it shall bee warranted. But tell me Pallas, ere thou goest, are all The German souldiers come? Pall: Madam they are. You have a royall guard. Ag: Go dearest Pallas, Dispatch Celerius into Asia, And the Centurion to Campania. Exit Pallas Now Agrippina is her selfe, and all The power and dignity she holds, her own. I do not owe it to a marriage bed, Or poore dependance on a husbands love, Where every minion might have rival'd mee. There is no power, no state at all, but what Is undependent, absolute and free. Besides my proper and peculiar guards Two lictors by the Senate are assign'd Distinct from CÃ¦sar and the Consuls state To wate on mee, that all the world at last Th'Imperiall power may in a woman know. I was an Empresse but ne're reign'd till now. Exit A banquet. Enter Nero, Britannicus, Otho, Petronius, Montanus, Acte. Ne. Come sit my friends, they here are freely welcome That bring free Joviall hearts farre hence bee all Sad lookes, sower gestures, and Censorious thoughts. They fit not Nero's table. kisse mee Acte, And smile upon the feast. Acte: CÃ¦sar's command Is warrant strong enough. Nero. And thou shalt finde No rigid Catoes here. Petronius. True, great CÃ¦sar, Let such sowre Scauri sit at home, and write Against the pleasure of this happy age Dull satyres, such as water, or the lees Of Tuscan wine beget, let them admire Those old penurious times. when Curius fed On leekes and onions, when Fabritus Feasted the frugall Senate with hung beefe And rusty bacon, and in earthen pots Drunke smal Etruscan wine, let them bee still Such as themselves would make themselves, unworthy To taste the plenty that Rome now enjoyes. Nero. Why did our famed ancestours so farre Extend their conquering armes, and strive to get The riches of the world, but that their Nephews Might now enjoy them? twere ingratitude To their rich labours, should wee scorne to use What they have got: or if the use of it In us bee riot, sure 'twas avarice In them, that toil'd so much to purchase it. Otho. Which of those rigid Censors, that declaime Against the vices of the times, and tax Rome as luxurious now would call it vertue In a rich Citizen, whose store-houses Were fraught with the best provisions, his chests crowded His cellars full of rich Campanian wine Yet hee himselfe to drinke the coursest lees, To feede on ackornes, pulse, and crabs, to wrong His nature, and defraud his Genius? Tis said the Furies keep pin'd Tantalus From tasting those delicious fruits hee sees. Such would the Roman vertue bee, should shee Affright her sonnes the masters of the world From tasting that which they themselves possesse. Petronius. Tis true; those former ages were most frugall; Wee thank them for't, the better is our fare. Let those that list, now when they have no need, Still imitate, and boast their hungry vertue, Whilest wee poore sinners are content with pleasants, Numidian hens, and Lybian purple wings Wilde goates, bores, hares, thrushes, and musheroms, Oysters, and mullets, and such vicious meates. Nero. Fill mee some wine. Montanus melancholy, And silent now? Montanus. CÃ¦sar, I was but listning To heare Petronius good morality, Nero. Otho I know cannot bee melancholy, Hee is a bridegrome, and but new possest Of that faire treasure he has courted So long, well Otho, I must have a sight Of faire PoppÃ¦a,; such I know shee is. Otho. Shee is unworthy of great CÃ¦sar's sight. Nero. A round, go Anicetus bring the lots; Because that no respect of power shall let The freedome of our mirth, who ever drawes The longest cut shall bee our King to night, And bee obey'd what ere hee shall command. I will resigne my chaire to him. Com draw. Enter Anicetus they draw. Tis I that am your King. Montanus. I shall beleive That Fortune has her eyes. Britannius. In getting Crownes Nero, thy fortune is too good for mine. Nero. I know none envy mee. Britannicus. No envy can Redresse my wrongs. Nero. I will beginne with Otho. I do command thee send by Anicetus Some trusty token that immediatly May fetch PoppÃ¦a hither to the banquet. Otho. It shall bee done, this ring will fetch her hither, Exit Anicetus. I never though 'twould come to this. Petronius. Thy plot Of bringing Acte in, I see has fail'd. Otho. I care not much; he would at last have seene her. Nero. Thou wilt not frowne my Acte, though thou see Another beauty here. Acte. So royall CÃ¦sar, Nor shall you heare mee envious, or detracting, Although I know PoppÃ¦a is a Lady Whose beauty does as farre excell poore Acte As Cinthia does the lesser starres, or Venus The other Sea-nimphs. Nero. Freely spoke, faire Acte. Acte. Here you shall finde the saying does not hold That women are detractors from each other. Nero. Meane time begin a health. Montanus. So please it CÃ¦sar To great Augusta, Agrippina's health. Nero. Let it go round. And now Petronius. I come to thee I doo command thee write A Satyre presently against those pleasures Thou didst so lately prayse, against th'attire, And costly diet of this notorious age. This is thy Taske. Petronius. I must obey the King: And now's the fittest time for such a satyre. I never finde my vertue of that strength As to contemne good Victualls, but upon A well fill'd stomacke. Nero. Give him wine to heighten't. Petronius. I've writ already a Satirick PoÃ«m In a grave angry way, where I complaine That Romes excesse, corruption, luxury, Ruin'd the present governement, and twixt CÃ¦sar, and Pompey caus'd a civill warre. Listen, and heare my castigations. âNow all the world victorious Rome had wonne âAll lands, all Seas, the morne and evening Sunne, âNor was content; the Ocean's furrow'd ore âWith armed ships; if any farre-hid shore, âOr land there were, whence burnish'd gold was brought âIt was their foe: by impious warre they sought â(Fates fitted so) for wealth, old known delight âThey scorne, and Vulgar bare-worne pleasure slight. âPearles in th'Assirian lakes the souldiers love. âBright polish'd earth in hew with purple strove. âNumidia marble brings the Scythian yeilds âHis early fleece, the Arabs spoile their fields, âBut see more ruine yet, and greater wounds âOf injur'd peace, the Mauritanian grownds âAnd Libyan Ammon's farthest woods, to get âWilde beasts are search'd whose teeth a price must set. âUpon their death, fierce Tigers fetch'd from farre, âAnd stalking stately on the Theater âAre fed with humane slaughter to delight âThe peoples eyes: after the persian rite â(Alas I shame to speake it, and display âThe ruine-threatning fates) they cut way âManhood from growth spoil'd youths, for Venery âSoftning their nature, to keepe backe thereby âIn spite of time, their age her selfe in kinde âAbused nature seekes, but cannot finde. âThey dote on Catamites, weake bending hammes, âUnnerved bodyes, and a thousand names âOf new attires, loose haire of men, in whom âAll man is lost! o slaves from Affrick come, âRich Citron boards, bright purple, which to view âCousening the senses beare a gold like hew. âA wanton traine, in wine and surffets drown'd âThe far fetch'd table do encompasse round. âThe wealth that all the spacious world containes âBy lawlesse armes the roming souldier gaines, âTheir gluttony growes witty; guilt-heads caught âAt Sea, alive are to their tables brought. Nero. No more, my furious Satyrist, thou hast chid The times sufficiently. Petronius. If you bee pleas'd I have obey'd. Nero. Well, I perceive Petronius A man may write a Satyre, and yet bee No Scaurus, Curius, or Fabritius. Petronius. A Satyrist should bee the contrary, And know those vices, which hee meanes to tax: Nero. Brother Britannicus thy taske is next, Stand up and sing a song. Britannicus. Give mee some time: I cannot doo't extempore, what subject? Nero. Choose that your selfe. Britannicus. Then give me leave to sing Mine owne misfortunes, how I came to loose The Roman scepter. Nero. How! that will not fit A feast of mirth. Britannicus. No, let them laugh that winne. Petronius. A good smart youth. Nero. This must not bee endur'd. I must bee freed from this continuall feare: Then bee excus'd, be merry Gentlemen, I wonder Anicetus stayes so long. Enter Anicetus with PoppÃ¦a. But see they come, is this PoppÃ¦a, Otho. Otho. Tis shee great CÃ¦sar. Nero. Wonder of her sex! Bright paragon of Rome! all beautyes yet That I have seene, have been but foiles to set A greater lustre on this starre of light. Otho. His eys are fixt; his changing lookes do speake A depth of passion, or my jealous feares. Dazle mine eyes too much. Petronius. Tis so; shee's lost. If ever Lady were a tennis ball Tis this, shee's bandy'd so from one to tother. Nero. Must then another reape the envy'd fruit Of my injustice? must PoppÃ¦a bee My crime, that tooke her from her other Lord, To be his pleasure? Otho. Is great CÃ¦sar sad! Nero. No Otho, still shee shewes more faire and faire. I cannot check my love; sit fairest Lady. And with your lustre grace our feast. I see Thou art a most incomparable judge In beauty, Otho, and were I to choose A wife againe, I'd trust no eye but thine. Otho. Would I might serve you Sr. in any thing. Nero. But tell mee thy oppinion in one question. Which dost thou thinke the noblest in a Prince, If hee would use his power, and do an act That may bee thought unjust, to do't for frendship, Or satisfaction of his owne delight. Otho. Sr. had you made the case a private man's (For the delights of Princes, as themselves, Wee must count sacred) I could soone resolve it. Nero. Let it bee so for tis the same in justice. Otho. I thinke it noblest then to do't for frendship. For frendship ever was held honorable, But satisfaction of our own delights A thing of weakenesse rather then of honour. Petronius. I see his drift. Nero. Augustus CÃ¦sar then And I by power have done the selfe same act. But in the cause I have excell'd Augustus, For hee to satisfie his own hot love From Claudius Nero tooke faire Livia. I from Crispinus took a brighter beauty To shew my selfe no lover. but a frend. Doo not mistake mee Otho, and suppose I do repent the favour I have done I know tis well bestow'd. Otho. Twas such a favour That I confesse, great CÃ¦sar, as no tongue Can bee enough expressive; so tis hard To find a heart that's large enough to pay Sufficient thankes in thought, but pious men Have still acknowledg'd that no thankes of ours Can Ã¦qualize the bounty of the Gods. And Princes are like them, should I thinke lesse I should both wrong the giver, and the gift. Nero. In valuing her aright thou shew'st thy selfe As wise as just. I wish thee joy of her. But fairest Lady, since it was so late Before you grac'd our feast, I cannot thinke That I have entertain'd you yet at all. The scene shall therefore change, another roome Shall bid PoppÃ¦a wellcome to the Court. Exeunt. Vitellius, Pollio. Vitellius. Yet CÃ¦sar and his mother well agree. Pollio. The Gods continue it, but Vitellius, I feare the sequell. Agrippinaes fierce And haughty disposition will too much Provoke her sonne 'tis thought; and hee too forward To throw all nature off. Vitellius. I thinke so too. And therefore I could wish that Agrippina Would go a gentler way, shee must not build Too much upon her merits, though wee know Twas shee that put the scepter in his hand. For vicious natures, where they once begin To take distast, and purpose no requitall, The greater debt they owe, the more they hate. Pollio. Besides shee'll find it harder far to worke Her ends upon a sonne then twas to rule A doating husband. Pollio. Time will shew it all, And we ere long shall know which way to leane. Exeunt. Burrus, Seneca. Burrhus. Will Agrippina sit to day with CÃ¦sar On his Tribunall, to give audience To those Armenian Embassadors? Seneca. There is no doubt shee would; but I have spoil'd That state I hope; for I have councell'd Nero. That if shee come, hee shall arise and meet her, As if he did it in respect, and duty Deferring th'audience of th'Embassador, I hope shee will not understand our drift. Burrhus. Pray heaven shee do not, for you know her fircenesse. Seneca. It would bee Romes disgrace, the Senates shame And my great crime if the Embassadors That come to plead their countryes cause at Rome, Should see a woman perching up with CÃ¦sar Into the chare to give them audience. And sit commanding ore the Roman ensignes: Twas not the custome of our Ancestors To see such sights. Burrhus. True Lucius Seneca, Our Ancestours had no such kinde of women, Shee in her heart's a man, and you mistake If you esteem her onely CÃ¦sars mother; Not his Colleague, and partner in the Empire Or more then so. Seneca. I am not so ingratefull To hate the woman, since I know it was Her favour, that repeal'd my banishment. But I dislike these things, that forreigne states In her unseemly carriage should behold Xiphilin The shame of Rome, and would shee keepe a temper Fitting the quality of her sex and place, I should admire the bravery of her minde. Enter Nero, Vitellius, Pollio, Nero, takes his state, after them the Embassadors. Embassadors. Long live great Nero CÃ¦sar, the cheife care Of heaven, and highest Souveraigne of the Earth, The Princes of Armenia, Vologeses And Tiridates greete your Majesty By us, and do congratulate the honor, Which since divinest Claudius left the earth To make a God in heaven, is fall'n on you. And to your high Tribunall doo referre The controversie that is now betwixt them. Nero. Enter Agrippina. My mother's come, defer th'Embassadors As twas appointed Seneca. Seneca. I will. Nero. Haile dearest mother. Agrippina. Wherefore rises CÃ¦sar From his Tribunall when affaiers of state Are brought before him? Nero. No respect can bee Too much for mee to give great Argippina. Agrippina. Excuse mee, CÃ¦sar, if it bee respect, Tis now unseasonable, take your seate, I'll sit with you my selfe, and here th'affaires Of these Armenian Embassadors. Nero. Wee have deferred the businesse a while, And thought upon a fitter time to heare it. Agrippina. If you arise because the audience Is ended or deferr'd upon just reasons, Tis not respect to mee that made you rise, As you alldg'd at first, but I have found it, The reason that deferr'd this audience Was Agrippinaes comming. Burrhus. This I fear'd. Seneca. Twas carryed ill of CÃ¦sar at the first. Agrpppina. I see thou blushest, Nero, and may'st justly, To call that reverence, which was affront, Was a dissembling not befitting CÃ¦sar. And to affront a mother so deserving Was not the duty that befitted Nero. Nero. Can nearest Agrippina. thinke her Nero. Will ever doo an act that may bee judg'd Affront to her Agrippina. This was thou know'st it Nero. And so does thy adviser Seneca From him it came, no other Senator Durst to have councell'd my disgrace but hee Seneca. Never will Seneca, so much obleidg'd To Agrippinaes royall favour, wish Or councell her disgrace. Agrippina. Oh Seneca. Philosophy nere taught ingratitude. If you had thought the place unfit for mee, You might have told mee privatly before, Not us'd this tricke which how so ere it hold In Stoticisme, I'm sure is nought in state. Vitellius. Shee payes him home. Pallas. Her spirit cannot brooke The least appearance of an injury. Agrippina. CÃ¦sar, I'll leave thee now, nor shall my presence Bee any hinderance to thy state affaires. Nero. I'll go a long with you. Agrippina. For Seneca I'll shortly teach him new Philosophy. Exeunt. manent. Burrhus, Seneca. Seneca. Shee's full of anger; but it moves not mee, Since what I did was just, and for the honour Of Rome and CÃ¦sar, honest actions Will bee enough protection to them selves. Burrhus. Take the best courses to prevent her fury. Seneca. Ah noble Burrhus, it must bee hereafter Our greatest care to curbe that womans pride, And what wee can remove her from all rule And government of state, for Agrippina Is of too hot and fierce a disposition. Burrhus. What should wee doo? twere pitty to incense Her sonne against her. Seneca. The Gods forbid that wee Should strve to make the Prince unnaturall. But to prevent this inconvenience I will perswade young CÃ¦sar not with purpose to wrong his mother, somewhat to abate Her dangerous greatenesse, to remove from her Part of her guard of German souldiers, And to displace her wicked counsellour That insolent and Lordly free'dman Pallas. Burrhus. You need not use perswasions to your Pupill (The Gods forgive it if I judge amisse) To stand against his mother, I much feare Hee will too quickly hate her, for no reason To state belonging; but because shee growes Imperious over him, and strives to curbe His lust and riots, those, those Seneca I feare are seedes of future tyranny And for his love (as if the fates decreed To make his passions all preposterous) His vertuous wife noble Octavia The only instance in this wicked age Of women great and good, is loath'd by him. Seneca. That most afflicts mee: could wee finde a cure For that disease, all other maladyes A riper age will in some part redresse, And I will strive to change them by degrees, And get him to forsake his loose associates. But let us first endeavour to remove Fierce Agrippina from all rule of state. Burrhus. I'l joyne with you, and use my best endeavours. Exeunt. Nero. Nero. Shall I that am an Emperor, bee check'd, Control'd and baffled in my Pallace thus? I will remove this mother farre from mee, And give command to Burrhus to provide That house that was Antoniaes for her. The Pallace shall bee free to my delights, I make no doubt but that the people know, And hate her pride, and will the lesse repine At what I do against her, I have told her (For shee provok'd mee past all patience) Part of my minde already, shee shall rue Perchance too late the fiercenesse shee has shew'd Exit. Agrippina. Agrippina. Ingratefull Nero, is thy mothers power So soone offensive growne? canst thou so soone Cast off all filiall dutyes, and forget What I deserve from thee? wouldst thou deprive Mee of all power that gave all power to thee? Did I so wickedly for thee procure The height of human state, that thou shouldst take All state from mee with greater wickednesse? Oh wronged Claudius, this sad punishment My bloody treason, and ingratitude To thy offended Manes justly payes. By the most loving, and most injur'd Lord, The worst of wives was more belov'd then now The best of mothers by a wicked Sonne. I'le make him know what hand it was that rais'd His fortunes to this height: but wherefore weeps Enter Octavia. My deare Octavia? Octavia. What accursed fate Pursues the wofull Claudian family? Agrippina. Deare daughter speake thy griefe. Octavia. Was I bestow'd, Or rather lost in marriage, to advance Upon my brother's ruine, Nero's state To bee by him despys'd, hated and made A base freed-womans slave? Agrippina. What freed woman? Xiphilin. Octavia. Acte thy Nero's concubine my mistris That dares within the palace to contest Nay to revile Octavia. Agrippina. She dares not, Nor shall she doo't, I'll slit the strumpets nose, If she dare speake 'gainst thee. Octavia. You cannot mother. Nero delights in none but her, his soule In Acte lives; on her he does bestow That love, that's due to mee: But mee hee loaths; Oh dismall love, Oh fatall marriage! Agrippina. Take comfort sweete Octavia, I'll redresse Thy wrongs, or venture mine owne fall with thee. Enter Nero. Nero. You have complain'd I see, Octavia. Is there a chiding toward? Agrippina. Has thy guilt, And th'unkinde wrongs thou hast already done Unthankefull Nero, to thy vertuous wife Xiphilin. Arm'd thee with such an impudence, that now Thou canst prevent her just accusing thus? Nero. How's this? Agrippina. Mee thinkes although thou hadd'st no sparke Of goodnesse left thee, yet in Pollicy Thou should'st not dare maintain a base borne strumpet Against thy lawfull wife great Claudius daughter. Nero. Mee thinkes in policy you might remember You speake to CÃ¦sar, not a childe. Agrippina. Tis true, Thou hast forgot the duty of a childe. Nero. I will bee better known; if I bee Crost In my delights, I will bee bold to crosse You in your pleasures too Agrippina. Oh heavens, what pleasures What joyes or studies have I ever had But to preferre thee Nero? are my cares And all my labours thus requited now? Let not too vaine and foolish confidence Of what thou art, make thee presume to wrong Thy mother and thy wise; or thou shalt know The Empires lawfull heire is yet alive. The wrong'd Britannicus is growing up To take his right, and to revenge the wrongs Which hee and all his family susteine Xiphilin. I'll go my selfe to the PrÃ¦torian Campe, And plead his cause before the Souldiers. There let one-handed Burrhus, and that base Unthankefull exile Seneca, appeare Against the daughter of Germanicus. Nero. Yes plead the cause of young Britannicus; And when y'have done, provide an advocate To plead your own. Exeunt Nero. Agrippina. Gone so abruptly from us, Slights hee mine anger so? Octavia. Madam I feare You tooke too harsh a way; his lookes were wilde And full of rage; my sad misgiving soule Tels mee some mischeife's working in his thoughts. Agrippina. Feare not, Octavia, weell take the best And surest courses to prevent the ill That may ensue: and if mature advice And councell cannot bridle him, wee'll use Another meanes to curbe his insolence: I have already by my bounty made Most of the Tribunes and Centurions. My guards are strong, and shall bee vigilant Over the safety of Britannicus, As mine own person, there's no open act Of mischiefe can bee on the suddaine wrought. Octavia. The Gods I hope will guard our innocence. Exeunt. Nero solus. Nero. My feares have been too slow, and twas high time That Agrippinaes thundring threats had wak'd My sleeping mischeefes; which shall now no more Study disguises, but appeare in bold And open acts with CÃ¦sars stampe upon um, Fearelesse of vulgar whispering jealousyes. Upon thy death, Britannicus, a price No lesse then Romes imperiall wreath is set. The deede, when done, will priviledge it selfe, And make the power of Nero strong enough To warrant his misdeede, who dare revenge Or blame th'offence that frees mee from a rivall? But I shall leave a worse, and nearer farre Behinde, my mother Agrippina lives; Shee lives my rivall, nay my partner still, Nay more then that my Queene and Governesse. I am no Prince, no man, nothing at all While Agrippina lives, must shee then live To make mee nothing? must the name of mother Outweigh a scepter? could the name of husband Protect her Claudius? no; her owne example Shall teach mee state: but first Britannicus Must bee remov'd; his death assures my state, And makes mee able to contest with her. That gentle poison, which Locusta gave him, If poison 'twere, whilest wee did vainely feare The peoples talke, has kept my feares alive. Where is this hagge? Enter Locusta. Locusta. CÃ¦sar. Nero. Witch. beats her. Feind, fury, divell. Locusta. Mercy, mercy, CÃ¦sar. Nero. I'll hew thy cursed carcasse into atomes, Thou gav'st Britannicus an antidote In stead of poyson. Locusta. Twas a gentle poyson, And such as you commanded mee to make, Hold CÃ¦sar hold; I will redeeme all yet. Nero. Do it or dy, make mee a poison strong, A quicke and speeding one. Locusta. It shall bee done. No sooner tasted, but it shall destroy. Nero. I'll see the tryall of it, and reward Thy service well; but if Britannicus Out live this day, this day shall bee thy last.

But shee seem'd to love Otho extremely. Petronius. I confesse Montanus I thinke her appetite stood well to Otho; For it is a rascall of a winning carriage And curious feature; but shee has enjoyed him Sometime already, and that passion Which you call love, does move in a degree So low, and feeble, it is soone swallow'd up In the deepe torrent of ambition. PoppÃ¦a's proud; nor can that breast of hers Harbour a love so strong, but it must yeeld To pride her quality prÃ¦dominant. Montanus. What can shee bee but Nero's concubine?

Shee cannot bee Augusta; that high name Octavia, while shee lives, will keep, hee dares not Forsake that wife (how e're hee do affect her) To whom hee may bee sayd to owe the Empire. Petronius.

It must bee love no more, but frendship now Twixt us PoppÃ¦a, which may still bee kept In absence by good wishes, and without Those nearer comforts which fond love requires. But who shall teach mee to forget that sweet Delicious lesson which loves schoole did teach, When thy admired beauty was the booke, And I a Scholler too too forward then? Oh would great CÃ¦sars power to cure my wound, Could but bestow so privative a good As losse of memory. but that, alas, Were too unjust a cure, and I could wish Rather to suffer still then quite forget That I was once PoppÃ¦aes envi'd love. I'll rather strive to solace my fick soul With contemplation of past happinesse, And by recounting ore our former joyes Deceive those houres of sorrow I must passe. Pop. And I for comfort of our absent love Will cherrish hopes that wee shall meet againe. Oth. No, thinke mee dead, bright love, and I'll enforce My imagination to beleeve that thou Translated by some amorous Deity Hast left the earth to beautify the sky, And turne Astronomer in love, to finde Thy figure out among those radiant lights Which Joves transformed Paramours have made. 'Mongst those I'll seeke for faire PoppÃ¦aes starre, And sweare I see it, rather then beleeve Thou liv'st on earth debarr'd from Otho's sight. I must begin to part, I see; for thou In modesty art loath to chide mee hence, And bid mee quit the place. Farewell PoppÃ¦a. Such height to hapinesse mayst thou enjoy As CÃ¦sars constant love can bring to thee Pop. As much good fortune follow Otho still Tis power that parts us. all the Gods can tell Exit Otho How well I love thee Otho. but those Gods, That have ordain'd another fate for mee Must bee obey'd yet Nero must bee wrought With cunning to my ends, or else my fortune Is low and poore, my title nought at all. Tis not the love of CÃ¦sar, but the honour, And that high title which attends his love That is PoppÃ¦aes aime, Octavia Debarres mee yet from that, and Agrippina Is fierce, and keeps her sonne in Pupillage. Enter Nero. Nero. Now faire PoppÃ¦a, thou art mine alone; Otho's remov'd, embrace the happy change That fortune brings thee, thou hast found instead Of him, a CÃ¦sar, who besides his state Has brought a heart as true to thee, and love As strong and fervents as poore Otho's was Thou wert before a diamond coursly set, A clouded starre. the Fates did pitty thee, And would no longer let that beauty ly Ecclippsed in a private family No seat but Romes Imperiall throne, no sphÃ¦re But CÃ¦sars armes were fit for these bright eyes To shine in, and the subject world t'adore Their lustre, like some constellation New risen to amaze mortality. Not Rome alone, but all the farthest shores That Peleus silver-footed wife ere knew Shall call PoppÃ¦a mistrrsse. PoppÃ¦a. Those are honours CÃ¦sar, too high, too great for mee to hope. Nero. To hope, my love, they are thine owne already. PoppÃ¦a. CÃ¦sar, thou know'st it cannot bee; and I That might have liv'd content with Otho's love; And there enjoy'd the honour'd name of wife, Must in the Palace find a baser stile. Nero. Thou wrong'st my power, PoppÃ¦a, if thou thinke I cannot give the highest stile to thee: And if thou thinke I meane it not, thou wrong'st My truest love PoppÃ¦a. Octavia is alive No love of thine can beare Augustus state But onely shee. Nero. Shee shall bee soon remov'd To make a roome for faire PoppÃ¦aes honour. Nor will the Senate dare to grumble at it. PoppÃ¦a. Though all were silent else, fierce Agrippina Xiphilin. Would in that act controll thee, and thinke mee To meane for CÃ¦sars wife, though I am sprung (For I may speake a truth that Rome can witnesse) From noble and triumphant Ancestors. Nero. There, love, thou strik'st upon the truest string. That Agrippina was my greatest feare, Though now shee is not; for I'll tell it thee, If Anicetus stratagem have taken, Ere this shee wanders on the Stygian shore. Weary I was of her imperious pride, And fear'd her cruell plots. How that succeedes Ys now my greatest expectation. Nor do I live till Anicetus come And bring my safety in that womans death Enter Anicetus. PoppÃ¦a. See, Anicetus is return'd Nero. Speake man, What is my fate? thou carriest in thy voyce The life and death of CÃ¦sar Anicetus. Your command Was done, great CÃ¦sar, but your mother scap'd. Nero. Escap'd? how could it bee, but you were false, And all conspir'd together to betray Xiphilin. My life in saving hers? how could shee scape? Anicetus. Wee chose the night to act it in; but night, Prov'd not so black as night; the starrs gave light, No wind at all blew as wee lanched forth Xiphilin Down in the Galley Agrippina lay, And at her feet lay Aceronia With joy discoursing of your curtesie, And favour lately shew'd her, but when I The watch-word gave, the covering of the place Loaden with lead fell downe, and prest to death Her servant Gallus. But when th'other part By fortune stronger, broke not, nor the vessell Was loos'd asunder, all beeing in amaze The rowers straitway thought it best to weigh, The galley at one side, and sinke her so There Aceronia floating in the waves Faining her selfe to bee the Empresse, cry'd Helpe, helpe the Prince his mother. But the rowers With poles, and oares straight kill'd her as shee swamme, But Agrippina in a silence caus'd By policy or feare, swamme to the banke, Having received but one wound, and there Succour'd by little barkes, through Lucrine lake To her owne house was carryed at the last. Nero. Oh, I am lost and dead; I shall bee straight Surpris'd and kill'd; shee'll arme her slaves, and stirre The souldiers up, or to the Senate house Complaine, and shew the wound shee has receiv'd And tell the story there. What shall I doo? Advise mee, my PoppÃ¦a, Anicetus, But yet advise mee nothing but her death, No other course is safe, Nero must dy If Arippina. live, call Burrhus to mee; Send forth the souldiers to dispach her straight. PoppÃ¦a. It is no action for a souldiers hand Nor will the campe for brave Germanicus, Her father's sake bee drawne to butcher her Let Anicetus. finish the exploit Hee has begunne. Nero. It must be so; go on With thy religious act, good Anicetus. Thou art obleig'd to finish it; or else What thou hast done already, will procure My ruine rather then security Choose thee what aide thou wilt. Anicetus. I have them ready. Feare it not CÃ¦sar, Agrippinaes dead. Nero. Oh comfortable voice thou art the man Thou only Anicetus, that bestow'st The Empire upon Nero. to thy guift I will acknowlegd it, and celebrate This as my day of coronation. What plot shall wee invent to hide the deede, And put th'intent of murder upon her? To bring you newes of her escape, I'll finde A way to doo't, tis strange none yet come from her. See Agerinus comes Enter Agerinus. Agerinus. All health to CÃ¦sar Augusta by the favour of the Gods Has lately scap'd a strange and wounderfull Danger at Sea. Ani. CÃ¦sar when any of her servants come What meanes this ponyard Anicetus lets fall a ponyard behinde Agerinus. In CÃ¦sars presence, Agerinus? Nero. Treason. Ziphilin. Shee sends to murder mee; dragge hence the slave, And torture him to death. Agerinus. I am as free From guilt in this as innocence it selfe. Nero. Hence with the villaine to his death, and thou Deare Anicetus, forward with thy plot. Exeunt Agrippina, brought in by Mnester, and Seleucus, shee sits. Agripina. Leave mee alone; but bee not farre from mee. Exeunt. Who would rely upon the gratitude Of men? or trust the fruit of benefits, That now behold, or shall hereafter reade My wofull fortune? I, that have bestow'd What ere the world containes, to bee possest By impious Nero, in reward, expect Nothing but bloody death twas too too true That strange deceitfull galley was a plot An impious engine made to murder mee, As by the fiercenesse of the slaves, my wound, And Aceroniaes death it did appeare. Can I expect that Nero should relent? Or that the tyrant in a brothers blood Embrew'd already, should not rather thinke No mischeife can bee safe till fully done? Oh had his thoughts beene good, had my escape Beene gratefull to him, all the house ere this With visitants, and clients had been fill'd To aske and see how CÃ¦sars mother did Where now are all the hailes the bended knees, Low prostrate faces, and officious tongues, That strove in honoring Agrippinaes name? Vanish'd alas, and nought but solitude, Ill-boding silence, and neglect remaine In this forsaken Palace. But too soone Ay mee, I feare the approach of vilany. What noise is that at doore! where are my servants? Mnester, Seleucus, Galla, Xenophon. No answer made! are they departed too! Then vanish all my hopes false world farewell With all thy fading glories. But alas, Whither from hence shall Agrippina fly? What regions are there in the other world But my injustice has already fill'd With wronged Ghosts? there young Silanus wanders, Lollia Paullina and great Claudius My murdred Lord, yet those sad spirits perchance Abhorring Nero's base ingratitude, And glutted with revenge, will cease to hate At last, and pitty Agrippinas state. Enter Anicetus, Oloaritus, and others Ay mee, is Anicetus, come againe? Then I am dead past hope, murder, helpe, help Xiphilin. Anicetus. You guesse our businesse right but tis in vaine To call for helpe, your guards are farre enough. Agrippina. Oh hold your hands a while; heare mee but speake Consider with your selves before you act A deed so execrable as will stick A lasting brand on your abhorred names. This murder will bee famous through the world. All men will fly your hated company. Like birds of night shall you for ever hide Youre guilty heads; or, which is worse then that, Nero himselfe, who did command the deede, (As you pretend) shall guerdon you with death, And quit himselfe by punishing of you. O rather venter Neros frowne, and keepe Your innocence. Anicetus. Can they bee innocent, That disobey their Prince his will? Agrippina. But sure You did mistake the Prince. I am his mother. Twas I that gave him birth; nay more, that put Into his hand the scepter of the world. Could hee command my death? Anicetus. Wee did not stand Examining the cause. Agrippina. Then strike this wombe This tragicall, and ever cursed wombe, That to the ruine of mankinde brought forth Xiphilin. That monster Nero, here, here take revenge. Here Justice bids you strike. let these sad wounds Serve to appease the hatred of the earth 'Gainst Agrippina for dire Nero's birth. shee dyes. FINIS.</field>
