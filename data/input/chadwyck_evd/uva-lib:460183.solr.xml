      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Titus Vespasian, Emperor of Rome. Vitellia, Daughter to the Emperor Vitellius. Servilia, Sister to Sextus, in love with Annius. Sextus, Friend of Titus, in love with Vitellia. Annius, Friend of Sextus, in love with Servilia. Publius, PrÃ¦fect of the PrÃ¦tors. Chorus of Senators and People.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Scene lies in Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The apartments of Vitellia, commanding a prospect of the Tyber. Vitellia, Sextus. Vitel. But wherefore, Sextus, dost thou still return To fill my ears with fruitless repetitions? I know that Lentulus, seduc'd by thee, Is ripe for insurrection; that his friends Wait but the signal to begin the tumult; That when the flames shall seize the Capitol, Thy followers will unite their force to assail Unguarded Titus; that each brave associate Will for distinction, on his mantle wear, O'er his right arm, a badge of crimson hue. All this from thee a thousand times I've heard; But see no prospect yet for my revenge: Or must we wait till Titus, in my sight, Shall give his faithless hand to Berenice, And seat her on the throne usurp'd from me? Speakâwhence this long delay? Sex. O mighty Gods! Vitel. What means that sigh? Give me to know the cause Of thy so frequent and mysterious change. Whene'er thou leav'st me, all thy soul seems fir'd Even to my wish; but when again I see thee, Thou art cold, irresolute. From whence this strange Perpetual strife of boldness and timidity? Sex. Then hear, Vitellia; hear my secret heart. When thou art present, thou hast all my thoughts; I have no will but thine; I catch thy fury; Eager I burn to avenge thy wrongs; and Titus Appears to merit all thy rage can threaten. But when I leave thee, and return to him, Forgive me while I speak it, Titus then Appears all goodness, and disarms my purpose. Vitel. Since thusâ Sex. Yet ere thou chid'st me, let me lay My soul before thee: thou requir'st revenge, But CÃ¦sar claims my faith: thy proffer'd love Impels me to the fatal deed; but Titus, With ties of gratitude, restrains my hand: Love pleads for thee, while duty pleads for him. Yet oft as I again behold Vitellia, I find new charms to fascinate my heart; And oft as I again contemplate Titus, I find new virtues claim my admiration. My bosom pants to prove its zeal for thee, But dares not turn a traitor to its prince. Alas! I cannot live if thou art lost; And, if I gain thee, I detest myself. Now chide me if thou wilt. Vitel. Ungrateful, no: Thou merit'st not my anger. Sex. Think, Vitellia, Reflect once moreâAh! let us not, in Titus, Deprive the world of all it holds most dear, Take from ourselves a friend, from Rome a father! Look through the records of antiquity, You seek in vain his equal: can your mind Paint one more generous or merciful? Speak to him of rewards, his treasures seem Too poor to answer merit: speak of punishment, His goodness finds excuse for every crime: He these forgives for inexperienc'd youth, And those for hoary age: in some he spares The unsullied fame of an illustrious house; And pities others for their abject state. He measures not his life by length of years, But acts of goodness done; and thinks the day Is lost, that has not made some subject happy. Vitel. Yet still he reignsâ Sex. He reigns, 'tis true, but claims No service that a Roman scorns to pay. He reigns indeed, but o'er so vast an empire, While Titus watches with unceasing care, What envied privilege attends his station But empty titles, and the name of CÃ¦sar, The burden his, the blessings all our own? Vitel. And dar'st thou to my face, with odious praise, Extol my hated foe? Hast thou forgot This hero, fam'd for clemency, enjoys The throne his father first usurp'd from mine? And has he not betray'd, nay even reduc'd me (This is his greatest crime) almost to love him? And now, perfidious! to recall again His Berenice to the shores of Tyber! He might at least from Rome's imperial beauties Have found a rival worthier of Vitellia: But, Sextus, to prefer an exile to me, A rude barbarian queenâ Sex. Thou know'st, Vitellia, That Berenice came unbid to Rome. Vitel. Relate such tales to inexperienc'd childhood: I know their mutual passion, know what tears Were shed when last they parted: well I know He treats her now with every mark of honour. There is no room for doubtâwho does not see it? Perfidious! he adores her still!â Sex. Ah! princess! Are you then jealous? Vitel. Jealous! Sex. Yes, Vitellia. Vitel. Must I be jealous then unless I tamely Submit to bear my wrongs without repining? Sex. And yetâ Vitel. And yet thou hast not heart to win me! Sex. O were I freeâ Vitel. Thou artâI here release thee From every promise made: I shall not want Some nobler hand to execute my vengeance. Sex. Hear meâ Vitel. I've heard enough. Sex. Yet stayâ Vitel. Farewell! Sex. My life! Vitellia!âO forsake me notâ Where would'st thou go? Forgive what I have said: I was to blameâbelieve meâI repent: Speak, speak, direct, command the sword of Sextus, Thou art my oracle, my fate's in thee. Vitel. Before the sun regain the western waves, Let Titus perish; let notâ SCENE II. Enter Annius. Ann. Sextus, CÃ¦sar Demands thy presence. Vitel. Lose not these short moments Which Titus steals from love and Berenice. Ann. Vitellia, noâthou wrong'st our mighty hero; Not more is Titus ruler of the world Than master of himself: for Berenice At his command already is departed. Sex. How, Annius! Vitel. Say'st thou? Ann. Yes; you well may gaze, When Rome with joy and wonder weeps: myself Can scarce believe it true; yet I, Vitellia, Was witness to their solemn last farewell. Vitel. O my reviving hopes! [aside. Sex. Triumphant virtue! Vitel. O that Vitellia had been present there, To hear that haughty beauty rail on Titus! Ann. No; she was softness all and tenderness: She went indeed, but went with full conviction That Titus lov'd her; that his heart confess'd, No less than hers, the pangs of separation. Vitel. She might be yet deceiv'd. Ann. Full well we saw Titus constrain'd to summon all the hero, To quell the lover rising in his bosom. 'Tis true, he conquer'd, but with painful struggle: He sunk not with misfortune, yet he felt Her keenest arrows, while his looks confess'd The godlike sufferings of determind' virtue; A dreadful strife and painful victory! Vitel. Perhaps I was too warm, and Titus yet May prove less guilty than my fears presa'gd. [aside. Sextus, forbear to execute my orders; All is not yet mature. [aside to Sextus. Sex. [to her.] Wilt thou forbid me To gaze upon thee, to lament in silence? Unjust Vitellia! Vitel. What does Sextus mean? Of what dost thou complain? Sex. Of nothingâHeavens! I dare not speak, though torture wrings my soul. Vitel. If thou would'st hope my love to gain, Lay by thy causeless fears; Nor with perpetual doubts in vain Molest Vitellia's ears. Who thinks to find his mistress just, Must still her truth believe; But he, who fears her faith to trust, Instructs her to deceive. [Exit. SCENE III. Sextus, Annius. Ann. Now, Sextus, is the time to make me happy; I have thy promise for Servilia's hand, And nothing more remains but CÃ¦sar's sanction To authorize our loves: this day, my friend, Thou may'st obtain it. Sex. Annius, thy desire Becomes a law to Sextus. I'm impatient, No less than thee, till our long faithful friendship Is strengthen'd by the ties of such alliance. Ann. I cannot taste of peace without Servilia. Sex. And who shall rob thee of thy soul's desire? Does she not love thee with the tenderest passion? While Sextus breathes, is not each act of his Devoted to thee? Is not Titus just? Ann. I doubt not theseâand yet methinks I fear. In vain I seek to calm to rest The heart that flutters in my breast; I feel my soul with fears opprest, Yet know not whence they flow. How anxious is the lover's fate! Ten thousand doubts perplex his state: Fond hopes of future bliss create But certain present woe. [Exit. SCENE IV. Sextus alone. Assist me, Gods! by slow degrees I lose Dominion o'er myself: this fatal passion Engrosses all my thoughts: Vitellia shines The star that guides my fate: the haughty fair Perceives her power, and cruelly insults me; And yet I dare not murmur. O the force Of sov'reign beauty! you who hold from Heaven This envied gift, take not by her example: Rule o'er mankind, but rule with milder sway. Let rebel minds receive your chain, With rigour there your power maintain; But those, whose hearts your reign confess, With barbarous pleasure ne'er oppress. No Thracian is so cruel found, In distant Thrace's savage ground, But spares the wretch, who casts away His recreant arms, and yields the day. [Exit. SCENE V. The scene represents a place before the temple of Jupiter Stator, celebrated for the meeting of the Senate: behind is a view of part of the Roman Forum, decorated with arches, obelisks and trophies: on the side is a distant prospect of the Palatine-hill, and a great part of the sacred way: a front view of the Capitol, which is ascended by a magnificent flight of steps. Publius and the Roman Senators: the Deputies of the subject provinces attending to present their annual tribute to the Senate. While the ensuing Chorus is sung, Titus descends from the Capitol, preceded by the Lictors, followed by the PrÃ¦tors, accompanied by Sextus and Annius, and surrounded by a numerous crowd of people. Chorus. O guardian Gods! in whom we trust To watch the Roman fate; Preserve in Titus, brave and just, The glory of the state! For ever round our CÃ¦sar's brows The sacred laurel bloom: In him, for whom we breathe our vows, Preserve the weal of Rome. Long may your glorious gift remain, And long our times adorn; So shall this age the envy gain Of ages yet unborn. Pub. This day the Senate stile thee, mighty CÃ¦sar, The father of thy country; never yet More just in their decree. Ann. Thou art not only Thy country's father, but her guardian God. And since thy virtues have already soar'd Beyond mortality, receive those honours We pay to Heaven. The Senate have decreed To build a stately temple, where thy name Shall stand enroll'd among the powers divine, And Tyber worship at the fane of Titus. Pub. These treasures, gather'd from the annual tribute Of subject provinces, we dedicate To effect this pious work: disdain not, Titus, This public token of our grateful homage. Tit. Romans! believe that every wish of Titus Is center'd in your love; but let not therefore, Your love, forgetful of its proper bounds, Reflect disgrace on Titus, or yourselves. Is there a name more dear, more tender to me, Than father of my people? Yet even this I rather seek to merit than obtain. My soul would imitate the mighty Gods By virtuous deeds, but shudders at the thought Of impious emulation. He who dares To rank himself their equal, forfeits all His future title to their guardian care. O! fatal folly when presumptuous pride Forgets the weakness of mortality! Yet think not I refuse your proffer'd treasures, Their use alone be chang'd.âThen hear my purpose. Vesuvius, raging with unwonted fury, Pours from her gaping jaws a lake of fire, Shakes the firm earth, and spreads destruction round The subject fields and cities: trembling fly The pale inhabitants, while all who 'scape The flaming ruin, meagre want pursues. Behold an object claims your thoughts; dispense These treasures to relieve our suffering brethren: Thus, Romans! thus your temple build for Titus. Ann. O truly great! Pub. How poor were all rewards, How poor were praise to such transcendent virtue! Chorus. O guardian Gods! in whom we trust To watch the Roman fate; Preserve in Titus, brave and just, The glory of the state. Tit. EnoughâenoughâSextus, my friend, draw near; Depart not, Annius: all besides retire. [all go out but Titus, Sextus and Annius. Ann. Now, Sextus, plead my cause. [aside to Sextus. Sex. And could you, sir, Resign your beauteous queen?â Tit. Alas! my Sextus, That moment sure was dreadfulâyet I thoughtâ No moreâ'tis past! the struggle's o'er! she's gone! Thanks to the Gods! I've gain'd the painful conquest; 'Tis just I now complete the task begun: The greater part is done; the less remains. Sex. What more remains, my lord? Tit. To take from Rome The least suspicion that the hand of Titus Shall e'er be join'd in marriage to the queen. Sex. For this the queen's departure may suffice. Tit. No, Sextus; once before she left our city, And yet return'dâtwice have we met, the third May prove a fatal meeting: while my bed Receives no other partner, all who know My soul's affection, may with show of reason Believe the place reserv'd for Berenice. Too deeply Rome abhors the name of queen, But wishes on the Imperial seat to view A daughter of her ownâlet Titus then Fulfill the wish of Rome. Since love in vain Form'd my first choice, let friendship fix the second. Sextus, to thee shall CÃ¦sar's blood unite; This day thy sister is my brideâ Sex. Servilia? Tit. Servilia. Ann. Wretched Annius! [aside. Sex. O ye Gods! Annius is lost! [aside. Tit. Thou hear'st not; speak, my friend, What means this silence? Sex. Can I speak, my lord? Your goodness overwhelms my grateful mindâ Fain would Iâ Ann. Sextus suffers for his friend! [aside. Tit. Declare thyself with freedom, every wish Shall find a grant. Sex. Be just, my soul, to Annius. [aside. Ann. Annius, be firm. [aside. Sex. O Titusâ Ann. Mighty CÃ¦sar! I know the heart of Sextus: from our infancy A mutual tenderness has grown between us. I read his thoughts; with modest estimation He rates his worth, as disproportion'd far To such alliance, nor reflects that CÃ¦sar Ennobles whom he favours. Sacred sir! Pursue your purpose.âCan a bride be found More worthy of the empire or yourself? Beauty and virtue in Servilia meet; She seem'd, whene'er I view'd her, born to reign; And what I oft presag'd, your choice confirms. Sex. Is this the voice of Annius? Do I dream? [aside. Tit. 'Tis well: thou, Annius, with dispatchful care, Convey the tidings to her.âCome, my Sextus, Cast every vain and anxious thought aside: Thou shalt with me so far partake of greatness, I will exalt thee to such height of honour, That little of the distance shall remain At which the Gods have plac'd thee now from Titus. Sex. Forbear, my lord, O! moderate this goodness, Lest Sextus, poor and bankrupt in his thanks, Appear ungrateful for the gifts of CÃ¦sar. Tit. What would'st thou leave me, friend, if thou deny'st me The glorious privilege of doing good? This fruit the monarch boasts alone, The only fruit that glads a throne: All, all besides is toil and pain, Where slavery drags the galling chain. Shall I my only joy forego? No more my kind protection show, To those by fortune's frown pursu'd? No more exalt each virtuous friend, No more a bounteous hand extend, To enrich the worthy and the good! [Exit with Sextus. SCENE VI. Annius alone. Shall I repent?âO noâI've acted well, As suits a generous lover: had I now Depriv'd her of the throne, to ensure her mine, I might have lov'd myself, but not Servilia. Lay by, my heart, thy wonted tenderness; She who was late thy mistress, is become Thy sovereign; let thy passion then be chang'd To distant homageâbut, behold, she's here!â O Heaven! methinks she ne'er before appear'd So beauteous in my eyes! SCENE VII. Enter Servilia. Serv. My life, my love! Ann. Cease, cease, Servilia; for 'tis criminal To call me still by those endearing names. Serv. And wherefore? Ann. CÃ¦sar has elected theeâ O torture!âfor the partner of his bedâ He bade me bring myselfâI cannot bear itâ The tidings to theeâO my breaking heart! And IâI have been onceâI cannot speak! Empress, farewell! Serv. What may this mean?âYet stayâ Servilia CÃ¦sar's wife!âAh! why?â Ann. Because Beauty and virtue never can be found More worthy of the throne.âMy life!âO Heaven! What would I dare to say?âPermit me, empress, Permit me to retire. Serv. And wilt thou leave me In this confusion? Speak, relate at full By what strange means, declare each circumstanceâ Ann. I'm lost unless I goâMy heart's best treasure! My tongue its wonted theme pursues, Accustom'd on thy name to dwell; Then let my former love excuse What from my lips unwary fell. I hop'd that reason would suffice To calm th' emotions love might raise: But, ah! unguarded, fond surprise Each secret, I would hide, betrays. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Servilia alone. Shall I be wife to CÃ¦sar! in one moment Dissolve my former ties! consign to oblivion Such wondrous faith?âAh, no! from me the throne Can never merit such a sacrifice: Fear it not, Annius, it shall never be. Thee long I've lov'd, and still I'll love; Thou wert the first, and thou shalt prove The last dear object of my flame. The love which first our breast inspires, When free from guilt, such strength acquires, It lasts till death consumes our frame. [Exit. SCENE IX. An apartment in the Imperial palace, upon the Palatine-hill. Titus, Publius with a paper. Tit. What means that paper, Publius? Pub. This contains The names of those who rashly have defam'd The sacred memory of our CÃ¦sars dead. Tit. Such inquisition, useless now to them, Can only furnish fraud with various ways To ensnare the innocent: I from this hour Abolish it, and that the informer's guile Henceforth may stand defeated of its aim, I here decree the accuser shall incur The penalties that wait upon the guilty. Pub. But justiceâ Tit. O! if justice should exert Her utmost rigour, soon the earth would prove A lonely waste.âWhere shall we find the man Within whose breast no guilt, no little frailty Has ever lurk'd? Let us but view ourselves. Believe me, seldom has a judge been known Free from that crime for which he dooms the offender. Pub. Yet surely punishmentsâ Tit. If these are frequent, They lose their weight; and chastisement becomes Familiar to the wicked; they perceive What numbers are partakers in their guilt: 'Tis dangerous to proclaim how few are virtuous. Pub. But some there are, my lord, whose daring tongues Have even attack'd your name. Tit. And what imports it? If thoughtless levity incite them to it, I heed them not; if folly, they've my pity; If justice prompt them, I am thankful for it; And if they're urg'd by malice, I forgive them. Pub. At leastâ SCENE X. Enter Servilia. Serv. Thus prostrate at the feet of CÃ¦sarâ Tit. Servilia! Empress! Serv. O my lord! forbear: First hear me, ere you grace me with such titles; I come to unfold a weighty secretâ Tit. Publius, Withdraw awhile, but wait withinâ [Publius retires. Serv. That you, O generous monarch! from the numerous fair That grace your court, all worthier far than I, Should on Servilia fix to share the bed Of mighty CÃ¦sar, is so vast an honour, As might with transport warm the coldest breast. I know the value of the proffer'd glory, I would be grateful, and must show it thus. Your choice is turn'd on one, whom yet, perhaps, You little know, and I should wrong your goodness By further silence, therefore come to lay My soul before you. Tit. Speak. Serv. The earth has none That more adores your virtues than Servilia: For you I'm all respect and admiration, But for my heartâbe not displeas'dâ Tit. Go on. Serv. My heart, my lord, no more is mine; for this Has Annius long possess'd; ere yet I knew it, I lov'd him, and have felt no second passion: A mutual sympathy inspir'd our souls; And, O! I find I never shall forget him. Even from the throne my mind would still pursue Its wonted course, I know 'tis criminal To oppose the will of CÃ¦sar: yet my duty Bids me reveal my thoughts before my sovereign: Then if he still persist in his design To take me for his bride, my hand is his. Tit. I thank ye, Gods! this once, at least, I've seen Truth undisguis'd; at length I've met with one Who ventures to displease by speech sincere. Thou canst not tell, Servilia, how thou charm'st me; How hast thou given me double cause of wonder! Annius prefers thy glory to his peace; And thou refusest empire, to preserve Thy faith to him: and shall I then destroy Such love and constancy?âAh! noâthe heart Of Titus breeds not such ungenerous thoughts. My daughter (thou shalt find me now thy father, And not thy consort) banish from thy breast Each needless doubt; for Annius is thy husband: Myself will join the wish'd-for knot. May Heaven Vouchsafe with me to bless the happy nuptials, And may from you a future race proceed, To glad your country with their parents' virtues! Serv. O Titus! Emperor! Joy of human kind! How shall my grateful soul expressâ Tit. Servilia, If thou would'st show thy gratitude to CÃ¦sar, Inspire each mind with candour like thy own. Proclaim it to the world, that more I prize The harshest truth, than falsehood's flattering voice. Did every subject near the throne, Like thee a mind sincere possess; Such cares would not surround a crown, But all be happiness and peace. The rulers of mankind no more Would search in vain the secret heart; No longer truth disguis'd explore Through all the mazy wiles of art. [Exit. SCENE XI. Enter Vitellia. Serv. O happy day! [to herself. Vitel. May I before my sovereign Pay down the tribute of my earliest homage; Adore that face, for which the breast of Titus, Wounded by love, has lost its wonted peace? Serv. Insulting woman! yet for my revenge Let her be still deceiv'dâ[aside.]âFarewell! Vitel. Servilia Already deigns not to behold me.âHeavens! And does she thus depart, forsake me thus? Serv. Complain not if I now depart, Or, if thou wilt, complain of love; Love rules the motions of my heart, And where he calls my feet must move. Nor deem it strange, that from thy sight, Transported thus I'm borne away By that excess of vast delight, That leads my every sense astray. [Exit. SCENE XII. Vitellia alone. And must I suffer such disdainful treatment? With what contempt already she beholds me! Inhuman Titus! is it not enough, That Berenice was to me preferr'd? Am I the lowest then of woman-kind? All, all are worthy thee except Vitellia! Tremble, ungrateful man, to think thou wrong'st me: This day thy bloodâ SCENE XIII. Enter Sextus. Sex. My life!â Vitel. What tidings bring'st thou? Say, is the Capitol in flames?âConsum'd?â Where, where is Lentulus?âIs Titus punish'd? Sex. Nothing has yet been done. Vitel. Ha! nothing done! And dost thou yet return so boldly to me? What are thy merits that thou dar'st presume To call me now thy life? Sex. 'Twas your command The blow should be suspended. Vitel. Hast thou not Heard of my last affront? And dost thou still Wait for a second bidding? Tell me how Thou e'er wilt hope to be esteem'd a lover, When thou so little canst explore my thoughts? Sex. O! might one cause but justifyâ Vitel. One cause? Thou hast a thousandâlet what passion will Direct and hold dominion o'er thy heart. Is fame thy wish? I bid thee free thy country, Shake off her chains, and crown thy name with honour: Our age shall boast her Brutus. Is thy soul For great ambition form'd? Behold a path To empire open: those that own my cause, My friends, are thine, my title to the throne I will enforce for thee. Say, can this hand Complete thy happiness? Receive it now. Fly, fly with speed; revenge me, I am thine: Return all stain'd with his perfidious blood: Thou shalt become my only joy, my blessing, My soul's best treasure.âWill not this suffice? Hear yet, and after linger if thou canst: Know then that Titus till this hour I've lov'd, That this alone produc'd my scorn for thee: That, if he lives, I may perhaps repent; That even again, (I dare not trust myself) I may return to love him.âNow, be gone: If love, ambition, glory will not move thee; If thou canst bear to hear a rival's name, A rival who may rob thee of my heart, Thou'rt then a wretch beneath Vitellia's scorn. Sex. How many ways am I beset!âEnough, Forbear!âThou hast inspir'd me now, Vitellia, With all thy fury: soon shalt thou behold The Capitol in flames, and view this sword Plung'd in the breast of TitusâMighty Gods! What sudden coldness freezes in my veins! Vitel. Why art thou thoughtful thus? Sex. Alas! Vitelliaâ Vitel. I know it wellâalready thou repent'st. Sex. No, I repent notâbutâ Vit. No more perplex me.â I see, ingrate! thy passion is but feign'd; Fool that I was! I thought thy words sincere, And almost I began to love theeâHence, Avoid my sight, and think of me no more! Sex. Yet holdâfor, O! I yield: already see I fly to serve you. Vitel. I can trust no further; Thou wilt anew deceive me, in the midst Of action thou'lt again rememberâ Sex. No: Punish me, Love, if I again deceive you. Vitel. Haste then: what mean'st thou? Wherefore linger thus? Sex. I go: meantime thy scorn restrain, Restore me to thy grace again, And nothing shalt thou ask in vain; I'll act whate'er thou canst require. O! look, and every scruple dies; To avenge thy cause thy lover flies; The charms of those all-conquering eyes. Alone shall his remembrance fire. [Exit. SCENE XIV. Vitellia alone. Yes, Titus, thou shalt find this slighted beauty Is not so mean; at least it can suffice To taint the allegiance of thy nearest friends, If found too weak to bend thy stubborn heart: Thou shalt repentâ SCENE XV. Enter Publius. Pub. Vitellia!âart thou here? O fly! for CÃ¦sar hastes to thy apartment. Vitel. CÃ¦sar! why seeks he me? Pub. And know'st thou not He has elected thee his consort? Vitel. Publius, Vitellia brooks but ill to be derided. Pub. Derided! CÃ¦sar comes himself to ask Of thee consent. Vitel. Servilia thenâ Pub. Servilia, Whate'er the cause, rejected stands. Vitel. And Iâ Pub. Thou art our empress. Princess, let us go; CÃ¦sar expects thee. Vitel. Stay awhileâO Heaven! Sextus!âunhappy me!âSextus!âhe's gone. Run, Publius, seek him outânoârather hasteâ O I have let my rage too far transport me! [aside. Art thou not gone yet? Pub. Whither should I go? Vitel. To Sextus, haste. Pub. What would'st thou have me say? Vitel. Bid him return to me this instant; flyâ Let him not lose a moment. Pub. I am gone. How much excess of joy distracts our sense! [aside.] Exit. SCENE XVI. Vitellia alone. What dreadful maze is this? Ah! dearest Titus! I own I've been unjustâand, O! if Sextus Should have effected what my rage enjoin'd, How wretched then must be Servilia's lot! But wherefore should I raise such fatal omens? Yet what if Titus should repent his choice? And why repent? What cause have I to fear it? How many different thoughts possess my mind! I'm now transported, now again I fear; And all within my breast is wild confusion. Poor panting heart, and wilt thou never Rest within thy troubled seat? Shall I view the moment ever Thou shalt cease a while to beat? Cruel stars! that thus torment me; Fortune shifts with me in vain: Pleasure's self cannot content me, Pleasure turns with me to pain. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. PORTICOES. Sextus alone, with the badge of the conspirators upon his mantle. Ye Gods! what means this sudden terror! whence This tumult at my heart! I freeze! I shake! I go and stop by turnsâeach breath of air, Each shadow makes me startâI did not think It could have prov'd so hard to be a villain.â But let us now complete our work begun: Already at my signal Lentulus Advances tow'rds the Capitol, while I Must rush on Titusâat the precipice I've set my foot, and dire necessity Must plunge me headlong down to final ruin. Yet, if I perish, let me fall with courageâ With courage? Shall a traitor boast of courage? Unhappy Sextus!âha! art thou a traitor? O dreadful name! yet this thou seek'st to gain. And whom would'st thou betray? The greatest, best, The mildest prince on earth; to whom thou ow'st All that thou hast been, all thou art. Is this His recompense? Was it for this he rais'd thee, That thou might'st lift thy murderous hand against him? Noâfirst gape earth and swallow meâVitellia, My heart will ne'er consent to aid thy fury: O rather, ere I see my guilt completed, Let me fall down and at his feet expire! Now, now the horrid plot is ripe for action!â Then haste, O haste! be Lentulus prevented, And as it will let fate dispose the restâ Ye powers! what do I see! the Capitol Already burst in flamesâyes, Lentulus Has now begun the fatal enterprize? And my remorse perhaps may come too lateâ Eternal Gods! preserve the life of Titus. [going. SCENE II. Enter Annius. Ann. Sextus, where dost thou haste? Sex. I go, my friendâ O Gods! detain me not. Ann. But whither go'st thou? Sex. I goâthou for my shame too soon wilt learn. [Exit. SCENE III. Annius alone. Thou for my shame too soon wilt learn! What secret Lurks in these words! And why conceal'd from Annius? What mean, ye powers! those ghastly looks! that speech Confus'd? Does any danger threaten Sextus? Sure then a faithful friend should not forsake him; Let me pursue his steps. [going. SCENE IV. Enter Servilla. Serv. At length, my Annius, Again I've found thee! Ann. O my soul's delight! How do I stand indebted to thy love! I will return this instant: pardon now This hasty parting from thee.â Serv. Wherefore would'st thou Leave me so soon! SCENE V. Enter Publius and Guards. Pub. Annius, what dost thou here? All Rome's in tumult; and the Capitol Is fill'd with spreading flames, while thou canst waste, Without a blush, the hours in thoughtless love. Serv. O heavenly powers! Ann. The words of Sextus now Fill me with double terrorâlet me seek him. [going. Serv. And wilt thou leave me thus in danger? Ann. Gods! My heart's divided between love and friendship! O Publius! guard her for my sake; in her My life's sole treasure I intrust to thee. [Exit. SCENE VI. Servilia, Publius, Guards. Serv. Publius, what fatal accident is this? Pub. Heaven grant it prove no more than accident, And not the work of some dark-dealing hand, That with a black design has rais'd these flames. Serv. Thou mak'st my blood run cold. Pub. Return, Servilia, To thy abode, and do not fear. I leave These guards for thy defence. Meantime I haste To find Vitellia. Titus bade me seek And shield you both from danger. Serv. Can it be? Has Titus leisure to reflect on us? Pub. Yes; Titus thinks on all. His wisdom still Provides for all amidst the general tumult; Takes every measure that may frustrate treason, And re-establish peace. O! had you seen him Direct the motions of the populace: The bold he curbs, the fearful he incites; Threats, praises, promises, in every shape His wisdom us'd; in him at once we see Rome's great defender, and the soldier's dread, The friend, the prince, the citizen and father. Serv. But thus surpris'd, how could he knowâ Pub. Servilia, Thou err'st, for Titus cannot be surpris'd: No stroke can come that finds him unprepar'd. What though no day of fight be near; What though the seas be calm and clear; The soldier ne'er on peace relies; The sailor doubts the mildest skies. In safety that his weapon wears; And this in calms his oar prepares; And either ready stands to brave Th' embattled field, or stormy wave. [Exit. SCENE VII. Servilia, Guards. Serv. To be forsaken thus by him I love; To know the perils that he runs to engage; To feel my heart now tremble for his safety; Yet not have power to follow him in danger; This, this indeed is torture, 'tis to bear The pains of lingering death, yet never die. Though I'm denied with thee to view The perils thou may'st prove; My heart's affections, ever true, Shall follow him I love. Love binds them in a lasting chain, Nor suffers them to stray; With Annius then they still remain, And shall for ever stay. [Exit with guards. SCENE VIII. Vitellia, Sextus, unseen of each other. Vitel. Ah! who for pity will direct my steps To find out Sextus? O unhappy woman! I've sought him every where, but sought in vain: Could I at least but meet with Titus! Sex. Where, Where shall I hide myself, and whither fly? O wretch! Vitel. Ha! Sextus! hear meâ [seeing him. Sex. Yes, inhuman! Thou shalt be satisfied; behold at full Thy dire command completed. Vitel. Ah! what say'st thou? Sex. Already Titus, O ye mighty powers! Breathes from his wounded breast his generous soul. Vitel. What hast thou done? Sex. Think not the deed was mine, Repentant of my crime I flew to save him: But scarce I came, when from the rebel band Full at his back a traitor aim'd the blow: âVillain! forbearââI cried: but, O! too late! The fatal stroke was given, and in the wound The assassin left his murdering steel and fled: I strove to draw it forth, when with the weapon The blood gush'd out and stain'd my vest; while Titus, O all ye Gods! reel'd, swoon'd, and senseless fell. Vitel. Ah! holdâwith him I feel myself expire. Sex. Compassion, fury urg'd me to pursue The base assassin, but in vain I've sought him, He has escap'd my just revengeâAh! princess! What wretchedness awaits me! never more Shall I have peace!âHow dearly have I bought The hopes of pleasing thee! Vitel. Detested wretch! Of pleasing me! thou fill'st my soul with horror! Can there be found a monster like thyself? When was there ever heard a crime more dreadful? Thou hast taken from the world its dearest treasure; From Rome whate'er it boasted great or noble! And who made thee disposer of his days? What guilt in him didst thou attempt to punish? The guilt of loving thee? In this indeed Titus has err'd; but surely this deserv'd not Its punishment from thee! Sex. Eternal Gods! Where am I? Is it thus Vitellia speaks? And didst not thou commandâ Vitel. Barbarian, peace! Think not to make me partner in thy crime: Where didst thou learn to second the distraction Of an offended woman? Who but Sextus Would not have seen through all my seeming rage A blind excess of love?âO thou wert born For my undoing! hatred from another Were far more welcome than thy love. Inhuman! I should be now the happiest of my sex Wer't not for thee! this day I should receive The hand of Titus, from the Capitol Give laws to half mankind; and, O! might boast Of innocence!âfor thee, for thee I'm guilty! I lose the throneâI have no hopes of comfortâ And TitusâO thou villain! he is dead! Perjur'd traitor! could'st thou ever From my soul her half dissever?â Yet in guilt I bear a part, I feel a chillness at my heart, I feel my vital powers decay. Why, inhuman! tell me why, Didst thou with my rage comply? Too late I rue the dreadful day, No tears can wash my stains away. [Exit. SCENE IX. Sextus alone. Thanks, cruel Gods! I've nothing now to fear: This is the utmost point of human suffering! Whatever can be lost, I've lost already. See friendship, love, Vitellia, Titus, all By me at once betray'd? Kill me, at least, Distracting thoughts that rend my breast! ye furies That tear my treacherous heart!âOr if you're slow To execute revengeâthe task be mine. [about to draw his sword. SCENE X. Enter Annius. Ann. Sextus, dispatchâfor Titus asksâ Sex. I know it; He asks my blood, and it shall now be shed. [about to stab himself. Ann. Forbearâwhat mean'st thou? Titus asks to see thee: He wonders thou art absent; why thou leav'st him When danger threatens thus. Sex. Ha! ask to see me! Say'st thou?âAnd died not Titus of his wound? Ann. What wound? he's from the throng return'd in safety. Sex. Thou dost deceive meâI myself beheld him Fall down transfix'd by an assassin's steel. Ann. And where was this? Sex. Within the narrow pass Ascending the Tarpeian rock. Ann. O! no; Thou wert deluded; 'midst the smoke and tumult Some other seem'd like Titus. Sex. How! another? And who would dare to assume the robes of CÃ¦sar, The sacred laurel, and the imperial mantle? Ann. All argument is vain; for Titus lives, And lives unhurt; since even this very instant I parted from him. Sex. O ye pitying Gods! O my lov'd prince! permit me, dearest friend, Close to thy breastâbut dost thou not deceive me? Ann. Do I deserve so little faith? But come, Thou shalt thyself behold him. Sex. Shall I then Again presume to stand in Titus' presence? What, I that have betray'd him? Ann. Thou betray'd him! Sex. YesâIâthe tumult first was caus'd by me. Ann. Is Sextus then a traitor? Sex. Yes, my friend! One moment has undone meâO farewell! I fly for ever from my native land: Forget me notâdefend the life of Titus From every future snareâforlorn I go To mourn in deserts my unhappy crime. Ann. Yet stayâye powers!âlet me reflect awhile: Hear meâas yet the plot remains a secret; And all to chance alone impute the flames. Thy flight perhaps might speakâ Sex. What would'st thou mean? Ann. Thou must not now depart; conceal thy fault: Return to Titus; expiate thy offence By every future proof of loyalty. Sex. Whoe'er he be, the wretch who wounded fell, Perchance discover'dâ Ann. Thither let me haste To learn his name; if yet the truth be known, If any speak of thee; I shall have time To tell thee all ere CÃ¦sar will suspect thee; Then canst thou fly. By still remaining here Thou may'st avoid that evil which thy flight Would now but render sure. Sex. Alas! my friend: I have no thought that can distinguish right: I trust myself to thee.âMust I then go? I go, if thou approv'st itâbut, O Heaven! Titus will in my looks discernâ Ann. No more; The least delay may ruin thee. Sex. I am gone: [going. But then behold this mantle stain'd with blood. Ann. Whence came this blood? Sex. It issu'd from the wound Of that unhappy wretch I mourn'd for Titus. Ann. With care conceal it from the sightâdispatch. Sex. Chance may perhaps revealâ Ann. Give me the mantle, And take thou mineâAwayâno more debateâ [they change vests. Soon will I join thee. Sex. O I am lost!âso deep Is my distress, I know not if I speak The words of sense, or incoherent madness! Thus one, who starts through troubled rest, With visionary fears opprest, Awhile confus'd and stupid lies, Nor dares believe, nor doubt his eyes: For even awake his thoughts pursue The shapes his dream had brought to view; While fancy still dominion keeps, He knows not if he wakes or sleeps. [Exit. SCENE XI. A gallery adorned with statues, adjoining to the gardens. Titus, Servilia. Tit. A plot against my life! how know'st thou this? Serv. One of the faction has to me reveal'd The whole design, and begg'd me to implore Your pardon for him. Tit. Lentulus a traitor? Serv. Yes, Lentulus was author of the tumult, In hopes to rob you of imperial greatness. He led the associates; he disposed the signals; He fir'd the Capitol to excite confusion. Already in your sacred mantle vested, The traitor hasten'd to his side to gain The troubled populace; but Heaven is just. The robes he wore with purpose to betray you, At once were your defence, and his destruction: A wretch, among the number he seduc'd, Who sought your death, deceiv'd by his appearance, Rush'd forth and plung'd his sword in Lentulus. Tit. And died he with the wound? Serv. As yet I know not. Tit. How could the black confederacy remain So long from me conceal'd? Serv. Your very guards Are tainted; treason there has found its way: And that the traitors may each other know, Thus CÃ¦sar they're distinguish'd: each accomplice On his left shoulder wears, to bind his robe, A crimson badge like thisâobserveâtake heed. Tit. Servilia, say, what think'st thou of dominion? Who more could sacrifice to other's good Than I have done? Yet all suffices not To gain the public love: there are who hate me, Who seek to pluck the laurel from my brow, The laurel dearly earn'd with toil and danger, And these can find associates even in Rome: By Rome is Titus hated. Mighty Gods! I, who have labour'd all my days for her; Have for her greatness shed my dearest blood; Have borne in distant climes the parching heat Of burning Nile, or Ister's freezing cold! I, who ne'er harbour'd in my mind a thought But for her glory; 'midst my own repose Still watch'd her good; who, cruel to myself, To please her rooted up my first affection, And stifled in my breast the only flame My heart could ever cherish!âO my country! Forgetful subjects! O ungrateful Rome! SCENE XII. Enter Sextus. Sex. [entering.] See there my sovereign; how my conscious heart Pants in his presence! [aside. Tit. Sextus, dearest Sextus, Come near, I am betray'd. Sex. Accurs'd remembrance! [aside. Tit. Would'st thou believe it, friend? Thy Titus now Is hateful grown to Rome! ah! thou who know'st My every thought; thou, who hast seen my heart Without disguise, thou who wert ever still The object of my love; declare, my Sextus, How I could merit such unkind return. Sex. He knows not how he stabs me to the soul. [aside. Tit. Tell me by which of all my deeds I've drawn This hatred on me. Sex. Sirâ Tit. Speak, speak, my friend. Sex. O sir!âI cannot speakâ Tit. Thou weep'st, my Sextus. Alas! my destiny excites thy pity! Come to my bosom:âhow my soul is eas'd Amidst her pains! how am I charm'd to see These tender proofs of thy untainted faith! Sex. I cannot bear itâI can hold no longerâ Methinks by silence I again betray him; I must discover allâ SCENE XIII. Enter Vitellia. Vitel. [entering.] Ha! Sextus here! Grant Heaven that he betray me not! [aside. Sex. This instant I'll fall before his feetâ [going towards Titus. Vitel. Victorious CÃ¦sar, The mighty Gods preserve thee. [interposing. Sex. How! Vitellia? There wanted only this to crown my misery. [aside. Vitel. Still, still I tremble at thy danger pastâ [to Titus. For pity speak not. [to Sextus aside. Sex. This indeed is torture! [aside. Tit. Princess! to lose my life, to lose my empire, Would not afflict me; these are only mine, As these conduce to work the good of others: He merits not his birth who thinks his life Given for himself alone: but if my blood Can profit aught to Rome, yet wherefore thus Employs she treason? Have I e'er refus'd To shed it for her? Knows she not, ingrate, That I'm a Roman, that I'm Titus still? Why should she seek by dark assassins' hands That life which for her sake I freely offer? Serv. O glorious hero! SCENE XIV. Enter Annius with the mantle of Sextus. Ann. Could I but relate To Sextus what I've learn'd, disclose his dangerâ [aside. My lord, already are the flames extinguish'd; But these were not the work of chanceâtake heed, For some there are who plot against your life. [to Titus. Tit. Annius, I know it wellâbut, look, Servilia! What do I see? Is not the fatal sign, That marks the traitor, on the vest of Annius? Serv. Eternal powers! Tit. There is no room for doubt; The fashion, colour, every thing concurs. Serv. Ah! traitor! Ann. I a traitor! Sex. What has chanc'd? [aside. Tit. Would'st thou too, Annius, shed thy prince's blood? And why, my son? How have I injur'd thee? Ann. I shed thy blood!âah! first let angry Heaven Transfix me with its thunder! Tit. 'Tis in vain Thou shunn'st detection, while that crimson witness, The rebel's dire distinction, points thee out A black accomplice in the cause of treason. Ann. What means my fate? [aside. Sex. Alas! what have I done! I read it now too plain. [aside. Ann. My lord, I know not Of any such distinction: all the Gods I call to witness. Tit. Tell me then from whom Thou hadst this vest. Ann. I hadâif I declare The truth, I must accuse my friend. [aside. Tit. Go on. Ann. I had it then fromâOh!â Tit. His guilt confounds him. Sex. O friendship! [aside. Vitel. O my terror! [aside. Tit. Where, my Sextus, Where wilt thou find than me a prince more wretched? All others, by the favours they confer, At least can purchase friends; while I alone, By heaping favours, make my friends my foes. Ann. What shall I say to clear me? [aside. Sex. Never, never, Must innocence be lost for meâVitellia, Thou see'st I am compell'd. [aside to Vitellia. Vitel. Ah! holdâwhat dost thou? Think of my danger. [to Sextus. Sex. O distracting state! [aside. Ann. Eternal powers! assist me. Tit. Now, Servilia, Think'st thou that such a lover could deserve So vast a price? Serv. I blush, and feel remorse That e'er I lov'd. Sex. Unhappy friend! [aside. Tit. But say, Ungrateful man! could not the thought alone Of such dire treason chill thy soul with horror? Sex. That most ungrateful wretch am I. [aside. Tit. But how Sprung in thy breast a fury so unjust? Sex. I can no longer holdâ[aside.] See, mighty CÃ¦sar, Here at your feetâ [to Titus kneeling. Vitel. Unhappy me! Sex. The crime Which Annius stands accused ofâ Vitel. [interposing.] Yes, his crime Is great, but greater still is CÃ¦sar's mercy. Sextus for him, my lord, implores your pardon, And I implore it too.âSeek'st thou my death? [to Sextus aside. Sex. How dreadful is my fate! [rises. Tit. At least let Annius Plead something in excuse. Ann. Fain would I speakâ But, O! what can I say! [aside. Tit. Sextus, my soul Is mov'd with sympathy. I see my presence Confounds him more. Guards, take him to your care. The Senate's justice soon shall try the offence Of thisâI will not yet pronounce thee traitor. Reflect, ingrate, and let it wound thy thoughts, How different is thy prince's heart from thine. Thy black designs too plain appear, No veil can hide thy guilt and shame; And yet to do thee wrong I fear, In giving thee a traitor's name. To friendship's treacherous mask you fly, Against your sovereign to conspire; While, pitying your confusion, I To hide him from your sight retire. [Exit. SCENE XV. Sextus, Annius, Vitellia, Servilia, Guards. Ann. And thou, my dearest consortâ [to Servilia. Serv. Hence! be gone! Thy consort I'm no longer. [going. Ann. Stay and hear me. Serv. Unmark'd by me each accent flies, By treacherous lips exprest; And every passion I despise, That warms a traitor's breast. Thy bonds by me shall ne'er be worn, Detested may they prove! The nuptials, and the spouse I scorn, The lover and the love. [Exit. SCENE XVI. Sextus, Annius, Vitellia, Guards. Ann. And speaks not Sextus yet? [aside. Sex. Methinks I feel The stroke of death! [aside. Vitel. I tremble! [aside. Ann. Sextus, now Behold me at the last extremity, Without an advocate to plead my cause. I need not tell thee what reproach I hear From every tongue, or what this breast conceals. This is too muchâthink what thy friend endures. Though like a rebel I depart, That still I'm faithful thou canst tell: I've ever kept thee near my heart, Let me in thy remembrance dwell. My chains without complaint I wear; But all resolves too feeble prove, A traitor's name unmov'd to bear, To bear the hate of her I love. [Exit guarded. SCENE XVII. Sextus, Vitellia. Sex. At length I may, inhumanâ Vitel. Yet forbear, Let us not waste the time in vain complaints: Fly, Sextus, and preserve thy life and mine. Sex. Ha! shall I fly and leave a guiltless friend? Vitel. Myself will watch the safety of thy friend. Sex. No, while my Annius still remains in dangerâ Vitel. I swear by all the Gods I will defend him. Sex. But what avails to thee my flight? Vitel. By this My honour and thy life are safeâthou art lost If aught betray thee; and with thy discovery My secret guilt is known. Sex. Within this breast It buried lies, and none shall wrest it from me: In death I will preserve it. Vitel. I might trust thee, But that I see thy tender love for Titus. His wrath I dread not; but his clemency I fear may vanquish theeâby those dear moments In which I pleas'd thee first; by all the hopes Thou e'er hast cherish'd, fly; remove my terrors: Much hast thou done already; O! complete The generous work: this is the greatest, last Request thy love can grant: thou wilt at once Restore my peace and honour.âSextusâspeak, Determine. Sex. Heavenly pow'rs! Vitel. Yes, yes, I see Compassion for me pleading in thy looks: I know th' emotions of thy tender heart: Tell meâam I deceiv'd? And do I hope Too much from thy indulgence? Speak, my Sextus. Sex. Yes; thou hast conquer'd; I will flyâwhat power Enchants me thus? Vitel. I am compos'd again. Sex. But when from thee I shall be far remov'd, At leastâ SCENE XVIII. Enter Publius and Guards. Pub. Sextus. Sex. What would'st thou? Pub. Yield thy sword. Sex. Ha! wherefore, say? Pub. For thy misfortune, learn That Lentulus yet lives; conceive the rest: Away. Vitel. O fatal blow! [aside. Sex. At length, inhumanâ [gives his sword. Pub. Sextus, we must be gone; the Senate now Are met to hear thee; and I dare no longer Delay thy presence there. Sex. Ingrate, farewell! If e'er thou feel'st soft zephyrs rise, Whose gentle breath around thee flies, O say, âThese are the parting sighs âOf him who died for me.â My spirit freed from mortal chains, Shall pleas'd review its former pains Rewarded thus by thee. [Exit with Publius and guards. SCENE XIX. Vitellia alone. Ah! whither shall I turn me now? Behold Ill-fated Sextus dies, and dies for me! By Titus soon my guilt will be discover'd, And all with him will witness to my shame. O no! I dare not speak, or fly, or stay; I have no hopes of aid, no friend to counsel: I can see nothing but impending ruin; And nothing feel but terror and remorse. What dreadful doubts my soul dismay! I tremble at the beams of day; At every whispering gale I hear, My bosom pants with anxious fear. Fain would I hide myself from sight; Fain would I bring my crime to light; Yet have not courage to reveal My thoughts, nor courage to conceal. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A private apartment; chair and table, with pens, ink and paper. Titus, Publius. Pub. My lord, already hastens on the hour Fix'd for the public games: you know that custom Requires the observance of the solemn day. The populace, in swarming numbers, crowd The joyful theatre; and nothing more Is wanting but your presence. Every one Pants to behold you from the recent treason Preserv'd in safety: then delay no longer This satisfaction to your faithful Rome. Tit. Publius, this instant we'll depart; but yet I shall not rest till we receive the news Of Sextus' fate. The Senate must ere this Have heard the charge disprov'd; must have discover'd (For thou shalt find it so) his innocence: The tidings soon will reach us. Pub. Lentulus Confess'd, alas! too clearly. Tit. Lentulus, Perhaps, but seeks a partner in his guilt, To share with him his pardon. Well he knows How dear is Sextus to me. These are arts Familiar to the wicked.âFrom the Senate None yet appearsâWhat can this mean? Go, Publius, Ask wherefore this delay: I would know all Ere I depart. Pub. I go: but much I fear I shall return the messenger of ill. Tit. Believ'st thou then that Sextus can be false? I judge his soul from mine; it cannot be He ever should betray me. Pub. Yet, my lord, Remember all have not the soul of Titus. How slowly does his generous heart Another's crime believe, Who ne'er himself with treacherous art, Another could deceive! No wonder he, whose honour tried, From truth could ne'er descend, Should think no treason could reside Beneath the name of friend. [Exit. SCENE II. TITUS alone. No, Sextus, no: I never will believe Thou canst be such a traitor. I have seen Not only proofs of truth and friendship from thee, I've even beheld thee melt with tenderness At Titus' fortune.âIs it possible A mind so far should change?â SCENE III. Enter Annius. Tit. Annius, what news? Speak; does not Sextus' innocence appear Clear as thy own? What say'st thou? Give me comfort. Ann. O sir! I come to implore your mercy for him. Tit. My mercy! is he guilty then? Ann. That mantle Which made me seem a traitor in your sight, He gave to me: by him the fatal badge Too well was known. Even now before the Senate Has Lentulus declar'd himself by Sextus Seduc'd to the revolt; while to the charge The accus'd made no reply. What would we more? What further hopes remain? Tit. Yes, yes, my friend, Still let us hope the best, for to the wretched Misfortune oft is guilt; nor always that Is truth which wears her form: this hast thou found. Thou cam'st before me with a rebel's badge; Thou wert by all accus'd; I question'd thee, Thou mad'st no answer, but didst seem perplex'd, Lost in thy guilt. Did not thy fault appear Then manifest?âAppearance yet deceiv'd us. Who knows but chance, unhappily for Sextus, May once again unite such seeming proofs? Ann. Heaven grant it soâbut should he yet be guiltyâ Tit. Should he be guilty after all my marks Of friendship, should I find his heart could ever Consent to harbour such ingratitude; I too like him might then forgetâbut noâ It cannot beâstill, still my hopes remain. SCENE IV. Enter Publius with a paper. Pub. O CÃ¦sar! said I not the event would prove it? Sextus is author of the black design. Tit. Publius!âCan this be true? Pub. Alas! too true; Himself confess'd it all. With his associates The Senate have condemn'd him to be cast A prey to hungry beasts amid the Circus. Lo! here the sentence, terrible yet just, Which only wants, great sir, the name of CÃ¦sar. [giving the paper. Tit. Almighty powers! [throws himself into his chair. Ann. Most merciful of princes! [kneels. Tit. Annius, forbear awhileâmolest me notâ [Annius rises. Pub. My lord, already for the solemn pomp The populace conven'dâ Tit. I know itâleave me. [Publius retires. Ann. O prince! thy godlike grace bestow, Though rigour sure is justice now; Yet thou wilt ne'er with rigorous hand, Exact whate'er our faults demand. Though crimes like his should ne'er obtain, Nor prayers, like mine, thy pity gain; Yet for thy mercy's sake forgive; For Titus' sake let Sextus live! [Exit. SCENE V. Titus alone. What dreadful treachery! unexampled falsehood! To seem my friend, to be for ever near me, And every moment from my heart to draw Fresh proofs of my affection; yet even then To plot against my life!âand do I still Suspend his punishment? still doubt to sign The rightful sentence?âYes, the traitor diesâ [takes the pen to write, then stops. His doom is fix'dâand shall I then unheard Send Sextus to his death?âYet why defer it? Have not the Senate given him ample hearing? But what if he should have some secret mystery To impart to me aloneâWho waits there? [lays down the pen, a guard enters. Yes: First let me hear, then to his fate dismiss him. Let Sextus be conducted to my presence. [guard goes out. How wretched is the lot of him who reigns! We're still denied the benefits of life The meanest men enjoy. Amidst the woods See the poor cottager, whose rustic limbs Are clad in rude attire, whose straw-built hut But ill resists the inclemencies of Heaven, Sleeps undisturb'd the live-long night, and leads His days in quiet; little are his wants; He knows who love or hate him; to the forest Or distant hills, alone, accompanied, Fearless he goes, and sees each honest heart In every face he meetsâBut we, midst all Our envied pomp, must ever live in doubt; While hope and fear before our presence still Dress up the features foreign to the heart. O could I once have thought to feel this stroke From faithless friendship! SCENE VI. Enter Publius. Tit. Publius, where is Sextus? Comes he not yet? Pub. The guards are gone with speed To execute your orders. Tit. What can mean This long delay? Pub. They but even now, my lord, Went from your presence. Tit. Go, and bid them haste. Pub. I shall obeyâbut see the advancing Lictors; And Sextus cannot now be farâhe's here. Tit. Ungrateful man!âyet at his near approach Already I perceive my former friendship Plead in his causeâbut noâit must not be; Here let him meet his sovereign, not his friend. [Titus seats himself, and assumes an air of majesty. SCENE VII. Enter Sextus guarded. Sex. [entering.] Almighty Gods! are those the looks of Titus? Alas! I find no more their wonted sweetness! How dreadful to me is he now become! [aside. Tit. O Heaven! is that like Sextus? Has his guilt Transform'd him thus? He carries in his face The blended marks of fear, remorse and shame! [aside. Pub. Behold a thousand passions now contend! [aside. Tit. Come near. [sternly. Sex. O well known voice! whose accents strike My shuddering heart! [aside. Tit. Dost thou not hear? [sternly. Sex. O Gods! My feet begin to fail; a chilly sweat Bedews my face; the agony of death Cannot be more than this! [advances slowly towards Titus, then stops. Tit. The traitor trembles. [aside. Pub. I know not which of these now suffers most, Sextus, reflecting on his crime committed, Or Titus, thus constrain'd to punish it. [aside. Tit. And yet he moves my pityâ[aside.]âPublius, guards, Leave us alone. [Publius and guards retire. Sex. O no! my constancy [aside. Can ne'er support the terrors of that face. SCENE VIII. Titus, Sextus. [Titus left alone with Sextus, lays aside his air of majesty. Tit. Ah! Sextus, is it true? And dost thou then Desire my death? How has thy prince, thy father, Thy benefactor drawn thy hatred on him? What if thou could'st erase from thy remembrance Titus thy sovereign, how could'st thou forget Titus thy friend? Is this the recompense Of all my tenderness and care for thee? Whom, whom, ye Gods! can I hereafter trust, Since Sextus has betray'd me? Is it possible? And did thy heart consent to my destruction? Sex. O Titus! O my gracious prince!âno moreâ [bursting into tears, and throwing himself at the feet of Titus. No more.âCould you but view this wretched heart, Tho' perjur'd and ingrate, 'twould move your pity. All, all my crimes now stand before my sight, And all your bounties crowd upon my mind. I cannot bear reflection on myself; I cannot bear those looks; to view that face I tremble; shudder but to hear your voice; And even your clemency becomes my torment! O hasten then my death! take, quickly take This faithless life: would you be merciful, Here let me, grovelling at your sacred feet, Pour forth my treacherous blood. Tit. Rise, thou unhappy! [Sextus rises. I scarce can bear to hear his deep remorse. [aside. Thou see'st to what a wretched state one crime Can sink the soul, a wild desire of empire. What didst thou hope to find upon the throne? The sum of all content?âUnthinking man! Behold the fruits that I have gather'd from it, And, if thou canst, desire it still. Sex. O no! Ambition ne'er seduc'd me. Tit. Tell me then, What was the cause? Sex. My weakness and my fate.â Tit. Explain thyself more fully. Sex. Heavens! I cannot! Tit. Observe me, Sextus; we are now alone; Thy sovereign is not present: open then Thy heart to Titus; trust it with thy friend. I promise thee Augustus ne'er shall know The secret thou disclosest: tell me how Thy faith was first seduc'd: let us together Seek some pretence to excuse thee. I perchance Shall be even happier than thyself to find it. Sex. Alas! my guilt admits of no defence. Tit. At least I ask it in exchange of friendship. I ne'er conceal'd my deepest thoughts from thee; And sure I merit Sextus should intrust One secret with me. Sex. What new kind of torture Must I endure, either to anger Titus, Or to accuse Vitellia! [aside. Tit. Still in doubt? Thou strik'st me, Sextus, in the tenderest part. Consider that this diffidence becomes Injurious to our friendship: think again, And grant my just request. Sex. What fatal star Shone at my luckless birth! [aside. Tit. Still art thou silent? Wilt thou not answer me? Since then thou canst So far abuse my mercyâ Sex. Sacred sir, Hear thenâbut whither would I now? [aside. Tit. Go on. Sex. When will my torture cease! Tit. Yet speak again, What is it thou would'st say? Sex. That I'm the object Of heavenly wrath, that I've no longer power To bear my fate; that I confess myself The worst of traitors, call myself ungrateful, Own that I merit death, and wish to find it. Tit. And thou shalt have thy wishâ [rises.] Guards! from our presence Remove the prisoner. [guards return. Sex. On that awful hand One farewell kissâ Tit. Awayâ [turning from him. Sex. This is the last Request I'll make: O sir! but for this instant Recall your former love to mindâ Tit. Away, 'Tis now too late? Sex. It isâit is indeed. Despairing from your sight I fly, Grim death I view approaching nigh, But view without dismay. Remembrance sharpens every dart, To think that e'er my faithless heart Could thus my prince betray. [Exit guarded. SCENE IX. Titus alone. When was there ever heard such stubborn treason! Could even the tenderest father treat more gently A guilty son? Yes, for my grace contemn'd, Though innocent of every other crime, He merits not to live: I owe revenge To my despis'd, neglected clemency. [goes towards the table, then stops. Revenge!âah! Titus, wilt thou then descend So low, to harbour such a base desire, That makes the offended, and the offender equal? What mighty praise is his who uses power For his revenge? To take another's life Is what the meanest of mankind can boast; To give it is the glorious privilege Of Gods and kings alone.âThen let him liveâ And shall the laws in vain decide? Shall I, Their guardian, thus enforce them? Cannot Titus Forget his friend in Sextus? Did not Brutus And Manlius once forget the name of father? O! let me now pursue those great examples. Henceforth the thoughts of friendship and of mercy Be blotted from my breastâ[sits.]âSextus is guilty; Sextus shall dieâ[signs the paper.]âBehold at length I tread The paths of rigour; see me stain'd with blood, [rises. Blood of my fellow-citizen: my friend Is singled first to bear the dreadful sentence. How will posterity receive this deed? Will they not say that clemency in Titus Is wearied out, as cruelty was once In Scylla and Augustus? They may say I've been too rigid; that his birth, his youth Might have excus'd him; that the first offence Should not be punish'd; that the skilful swain Lops not with thoughtless haste some branch unsound, Till all his art has prov'd in vain to save it. They'll say, perhaps, that Titus was the offended, And might, without a breach of public justice, Have pardon'd crimes contriv'd against himself. Then shall I do my heart such violence, Yet rest uncertain of the world's approval? No, let me not forsake the wonted path My nature showsâthough faithless yet my friend Shall liveâ[tears the paper.]âand if I must endure the tongue Of public censure, let me be condemn'd For mercy, not for rigour.âPublius.â [throws down the paper. SCENE X. Enter Publius. Pub. CÃ¦sar. Tit. Let us be goneâthe populace expect us. Pub. And what of Sextus, sir? Tit. Be Sextus likewise Conducted to the Circus. Pub. Then his fateâ Tit. Yes, Publius, 'tis determin'd. Pub. Wretched Sextus! [aside. Tit. Ye friendly powers! if sovereign sway Demand a heart severe, Take, take this envied state away, Or change the mind I bear. If love cannot with gentle ties My subjects' faith ensure, The allegiance never shall I prize, Which punishments secure. [Exit. SCENE XI. Publius, Vitellia. Vitel. Hear, Publius.â Pub. Pardon me, for I must now Attend on CÃ¦sar. [going. Vitel. Whither? Pub. To the Circus. Vitel. And what of Sextus? Pub. Sextus will be there. Vitel. Then must he die? Pub. Too true he must. Vitel. Ah me! [aside. Did Sextus speak with Titus? Pub. Yes; they long Convers'd together. Vitel. Know'st thou then what pass'd? Pub. No; they were left alone by CÃ¦sar's order; I was withdrawn apart. [Exit. SCENE XII. Vitellia alone. I can no longer Nourish fallacious hopes; it must be so: Already Sextus has discover'd me; I read it plainly in the looks of Publius: I ne'er before perceiv'd him thus; he shuns me; Fears to be with me longâO! would to Heaven I had obey'd the impulse of my heart! I should in time to Titus have disclos'd My secret thoughts, and laid my crime before him: For oft the penitent, that owns his fault, Takes half the guilt awayâ'tis now too late; CÃ¦sar has heard it all, but not from me; This must incense him further. SCENE XIII. Enter Annius and Servilia from different sides. Serv. Ah! Vitellia! Ann. Ah! princess! Serv. My unhappy brotherânowâ Ann. My dearest friendâ Serv. Is led to death. Ann. Erelong, All Rome spectators, must he be the prey Of savage beasts. Vitel. What power's in me to help him? Serv. CÃ¦sar will grant his life to your entreaties. Ann. To his new empress nothing he'll refuse. Vitel. Annius, I am not empress yetâ Ann. Before Yon' sun salutes the west, Titus will join His hand with yours: this instant, in my presence He gave directions for the nuptial pomp. Vitel. Sextus has then conceal'd my secret still; O unexampled proof of faith and love! [aside. Annius, Servilia, let us hasteâbut whither Unthinking would I go?âDepart, my friends, And I will follow. Ann. But should Sextus trust To late assistance, Sextus then is lost! [Exit. SCENE XIV. Vitellia, Servilia. Vitel. Go thou, Servilia, tooâfor one short moment I would be left alone. Serv. Ah! let him not Thus perish in his early bloom of life: Thou know'st till now that he was ever held The darling hope of Rome; and who can tell By whom he was seduc'd? In thee compassion Would be but gratitude: this hapless man Priz'd thee far dearer than himself: thy name Was ever on his lips; and from his cheek The colour fled when he discours'd of thee. Thou weep'stâ Vitel. Ah! goâ Serv. But why wilt thou remain? Methinks, Vitelliaâ Vitel. O ye powers! departâ I'll come this instantâhenceâdistract me not. Serv. If only pity you bestow, My brother to defend: In vain is all the grief you show, In vain your tears descend. Why these gentle passions cherish? Give your fruitless pity o'er: When you leave him thus to perish, What could cruelty do more? [Exit. SCENE XV. Vitellia alone. Now, now, Vitellia, is the time to prove Thy utmost constancy: canst thou resolve To see thy faithful Sextus pale and breathless? Sextus, who loves thee dearer than his life; Who, by thy fault, to obey thy cruel will, Incurr'd the guilt of treason; who adores thee, Inhuman as thou art! who even in death Preserves to thee his faith inviolate? Shalt thou, meanwhile, though conscious of thy crime, Without remorse ascend the bed of CÃ¦sar? O! I should see for ever Sextus near me; Should tremble lest the earth and air might whisper My guilt to Titus! Let me fly this instant, And prostrate at his feet discover all. If Sextus cannot wholly stand absolv'd, At least I may extenuate his offence. Farewell the hopes of empire and of nuptials! Such thoughts were madness nowâlet but my breast Be freed for ever from these racking pangs, And all my hopes I scatter to the winds. The sailor, when the tempest raves, Casts in the sea his precious stores; Which through a mighty tract of waves, His vessel brought from foreign shores. Returning to his native land, His thanks he to the Gods repays, That once again the wish'd-for strand, Though poor, in safety he surveys. [Exit. SCENE XVI. A magnificent entrance to a spacious amphitheatre, the inside of which is discovered through the several arches that support it. In the midst of the circus are seen the conspirators condemned to the wild beasts. While the following Chorus is sung, Titus comes out, preceded by the Lictors, surrounded by the Senators and Patricians, and followed by the PrÃ¦tors: then Annius and Servilia from different sides. Chorus. 'Tis now, exalted hero! known That Titus to the Gods is dear; This single day's events have shown, That you the God's protection share. Hail, happy CÃ¦sar! virtue must In Heaven for ever find a friend; And those, who like themselves are just, The righteous Gods will thus defend. Tit. Ere yet the games begin, before our presence, Guards, bring the criminal.âHis hopes of pardon Are now extinct; thus what he least expects, Will come with double welcome. [aside. Ann. CÃ¦sar, mercy! Serv. Mercy, O sacred sir! Tit. If now you sue For Sextus, 'tis too lateâhis doom is fix'd. Ann. And can you then, with looks serene, condemn Sextus to death? Serv. How has the heart of Titus Forgot its wonted goodness! Tit. Peaceâhe comes. Serv. O Sextus! Ann. O my friend! SCENE XVII. Enter Publius and Sextus conducted by the Lictors. Tit. Sextus, thou know'st The nature of thy crimes: nor need I tell thee What punishment awaits them. Rome o'erturn'd, Insulted majesty, the laws infring'd, Friendship betray'd, offended Heaven and earth Require thy deathâthou know'st my life alone Thy treason aim'd atâmark me nowâ SCENE LAST. Enter Vitellia. Vitel. Behold Most mighty CÃ¦sar, prostrate at your feet, [throwing herself at the feet of Titus. The most distress'dâ Tit. Ah! riseâwhat dost thou mean? What is it thou would'st say? Vitel. I bring before thee The author of this foul design. Tit. Where is he That could contrive such snares against my life? Vitel. Thou'lt not believe it. Tit. Wherefore? Vitel. Iâam guilty. Tit. Thou too, Vitellia! Sex., Serv. O ye powers! Ann., Pub. O Heavens! Tit. Which of ye more have plotted to betray me? Vitel. I am the guiltiestâI contriv'd the treason; I from his faith seduc'd your dearest friend, And urg'd him, blinded by my wiles, to attempt Your sacred life. Tit. What caus'd thy rage against me? Vitel. Your goodness, which I constru'd into love. Vain hopes I nourish'd to receive from you Your hand in marriage, and to share the throne: But since, neglected twice, I sought revenge. Tit. What dreadful day is this! even at the instant I stand prepar'd to pardon one offender, Another is discover'd: righteous powers! Where shall I find a faithful friend? The stars Have surely all conspir'd to make me cruel, Spite of my nature.âNoâthey shall not boast Such triumph o'er me: still my constant mind Shall hold her wonted tenour. Let us prove Which can be most unshaken, treachery In other breasts, or clemency in mine. Guards, strike off Sextus' chains; give Lentulus And his companions life and liberty. Be witness Rome that I am still the same; That Titus knows, forgets, and pardons all. Ann., Pub. O generous prince! Serv. What virtue e'er before Attain'd such godlike height! Sex. I'm motionless. Vitel. I cannot hold from tears. Tit. To thee, Vitellia, This hand I promis'dâbutâ Vitel. I know it, CÃ¦sar, 'Tis not for me, for after guilt like mine, Such union would be monstrous. Tit. Yet, in part, I'll answer thy desire: I plight my word Thou ne'er shalt see a rival on the throne. I'll have no other consort now than Rome; No children but my subjects: my affections Shall undivided center all in them. Thou, princess, to the approaching happy nuptials Of Annius and Servilia add thy own: To Sextus give thy hand; the wish'd-for grant His love has dearly purchas'd. Vitel. While I live Your will shall ever dictate to my heart. Sex. O CÃ¦sar! O my lord! and will you yet Refuse our adoration? Shall not Tyber Raise temples to your name? How can I hope The bitter memory of my past offencesâ Tit. Sextus, enough; let us once more be friends, And never speak again of errors past; For these already in the breast of Titus Are cancell'd all: I blot them from my thoughts; And while I thus embrace, I pardon thee. [embraces Sextus. Chorus. 'Tis now, exalted hero! known That Titus to the Gods is dear; This single day's events have shown, That you the Gods' protection share. Hail, happy CÃ¦sar! virtue must In Heaven for ever find a friend; And those, who like themselves are just, The righteous Gods will thus defend. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
