      <field name="fulltext">Act I. Scene I. GONDIBERT and ULFINORE. Gondibert. Blest be the Hour which brought me to this Seat Of Piety and Peace: may Ev'ning crown it With all the softest Purple of the Sky: The Hour when Astragon receiv'd me first With hospitable Arms, and heal'd my Wounds. 'Twas then I learn'd the Vanity of Fame: Then Virtue open'd all her Charms upon me, Her modest Charms, superior to the Blaze Of courtly Pomp, and brighter than a Crown. Ulfinore. Yes;âthen his Daughter taught your Soul to languish, The Flame of Glory sicken'd into Love. When Virtue courts us in so fair a Form, No wonder Pomp and Kingdoms fade before Her. Gondibert. Yes, I must own, my Friend, my gentle Ulfinore, Thou dear Companion of my Youth, I own That Birtha triumphs in my yielded Heart; My Heart, my Life, my Soul, my All are Birtha's: And can I blame my Passion? can you blame it? For, oh, her Truth is matchless as her Beauty! Such winning Innocence, such spotless Graces, So Young, so full of Tenderness and Love! By Heaven, my Ulfinore, She's more than Woman! Ulfinore. She shou'd be more: for royal Rhodolinda Cou'd never steal your Breast into a Sigh. This Heiress to the Crown of Lombardy, This Rhodolinda, tho' she doats upon you, And pines her Life away, must weep in Vain, Neglected for the Daughter of poor Astragon. Gondibert. Is She not rich in all her Father's Virtues? Then what are Crowns to Virtue, Love and Birtha? Is She not fairer than the Morning Light? Is She not softer than the Ev'ning Dews That kiss, then melt away upon the Flow'rs? Chaster than Lillies clad in Summer-Fragrance? And sweeter than the rosy Mouth of Spring? But You have seen Her often:âthen She loves me, She loves me with such dear Excess of Fondnessâ I pity Monarchs while I sigh before Her. Ulfinore. I find She hangs so close around his Heart, No Hopes, alass, no hopes are left for me. [Aside. 'Tis strange that Birtha, by her Father tutour'd, Ev'n with a stoical Severity, That She, unknown to Galantry and Courts, So soon shou'd learn to Love, should melt so soon. Gondibert. To love is Nature; Love's the Law of Kindness; Springs from a Look, a Sigh, perhaps, a Tear; Bathes in the Blushes of a Virgin-Cheek, Or flutters round a Bosom's heaving Hills. But, oh, when Harmony of Souls is blended Into this softest, best of Passions, Love; When Honour beams on Honour, 'tis a Flame Which Art can never raise; a Holy Union, A golden Chain of Hearts let down from Heav'n. 'Tis silent as the Whisper of a Genius, Which breaths Delight into a good Man's Soul, First tunes his Mind, and sweetens every Passion, Then opens Heav'n upon his dazzled Senses, That pant for sacred Bliss and burn with Rapture! Ulfinore. But strove She not to hide her Passion from you? Did She not blush whene're you sigh'd your Vows, And dy'd upon her Hand? For tender Virgins, Tho' their soft Bosoms swell with warmest Wishes, Pretend a Coldness foreign to their Hearts. Oh? How I long to hear what must undoe me! [Aside. Gondibert. I'll tell Thee all the Progress of our Love, For I believe Thee faithful in thy Friendship, And my whole Breast is thine, my secret Soul. When first my Wounds confin'd me to my Chamber, She waited on me with assiduous Care, Compassionately sweet! She seem'd a Guardian, Sent from the Skies in Pity to relieve me. Her charmful Presence soften'd pain away. Whene're her tender Fingers dress'd my Wounds, A pleasing Anguish tingel'd through my Veins, And Sighs unbidden, soft, and thick, stole from me, Whene're I sigh'd, She thought they rose from Pain, And wept a Show'r of simpathizing Sorrow. But when, like dewy Morn, She shone in Tears, In beauteous TearsâO Ulfinore!âO Heav'n!â Love dip'd his Arrows in the falling Crystal: The busy Graces gather'd, e're they fell, The liquid Pearls, which trembled down her Cheek, To sparkle on the Arm and Neck of Venus. Ulfinore. Contain yourself, dear Sir: But did she weep? Gondibert. She wept: I saw the silver-streaming Show'r, Which fell like Drops of Fire upon my Heart. But when I talk'd of Love, and of her Conquest, Quick Waves of Scarlet floated through her Cheeks, And dy'd Them in the Morning's deepest Red, Just as if Modesty herself had chose A Throne of Coral there, and Crown of Roses. An artless Fondness languish'd o'er her Features; And, lifted up and down by sudden Starts, Her Bosom rose and fell as soft and white, As rising Lillies or as falling Snow. She sigh'd, deny'd; she melted, and withdrew. I saw the Woman stealing on her Soul, And look'd and vow'd, and swore such tender Things, As stop'd her backward Flight and won her Heart. E're since we liv'd within the Skies!âthe Hours Are wing'd away with Love and downy Joys. Our Kisses are so pure, so warm with Innocence, Our Sighs so glowing, yet so chastly sweet, That Zephyrs waft them on their gentle Wings, As grateful Incense, to the Throne of Love. Ulfinore. O State of Bliss! Gondibert. But, Ulfinore, retire; My Birtha, at her promis'd Hour, attends me. And yet, observe Her;âoh! observe her Beauties: That Face, illumin'd by her brighter Mind; That easy, unaffected, graceful Port! And then her Softness, her entrancing Softness! She smiles the Spring, and blushes-almost-Heav'n! Mark how the flowing Wonders of her Breast, Impatient of Confinement, pant for Freedom, And seem to struggle with their silken Bonds! See how her Lips,âI taste Them while I see Themâ Swell sweetly-pouting with nectareal Dew, To feed and satisfy the thirsty Soul. What living Purple animates her Cheeks! 'Tis not the Blood of Youth and Flush of Health That mantles high and kindles up her Charms: No!âit is more!âthe very Health of Virtue, The Mark and Tincture of immortal Bloom. âI fly on all the Wings of Love to meet Her. [Exit Ulfinore. SCENE II. GONDIBERT and BIRTHA. Gondibert. You come, my Birtha, like the op'ning East, Half strow'd with Blushes, and half drest in Smiles. When thou art absent Darkness broods around, And Melancholy spreads her baleful Wing: But now my Sun of Beauty gilds the Gloom, To bless my Eyes and cheer my Heart with Gladness. For, oh, believe me, I am ne'er so happy As when I hang dissolving o'er thy Beauties, As when I pour my Soul upon thy Lips, As when I languish, languish on thy Bosom, And, oh, as when I sink into thy Arms And lose myself in Softness and in Love. Birtha. If I can make you happy, sure, my Lord, 'Tis my first Duty to attend your Pleasure, Since you neglect the Court and all its Pomp For Love and me; for so you please to honour The humble Daughter of your poor, old Friend, And condescend to dignify our Shades. Gondibert. These rural Shades are the best Friends of Love. From Palaces He flies, and Midnight Balls, To revel in the Myrtles and the Groves. Here, here I found Him panting on thy Breast, And envy'd Him so fair, so soft a Throne. Oh, what are Courts to Shades possess'd of Thee, Thou darling of my Soul! I joy more in Thee, Than high Ambition in its darling Purpose. Birtha. Like a young Flow'r, o'ercharg'd with balmy Dew, I sink beneath th'Abundance of your Kindness, For I have nothing to return but Love. Gondibert. I swear, my Fair, by thy dearself I swear, By that inchanting Smile, by every Grace, (And every Grace is thine) thy Love is more, Thy Love is doubly more than Worlds to me. Tho' Nature offer'd all her Treasures up, Her Spices, Gold, and Gems to buy my Faith, I'd dash Them to the Earth in Scorn, and fly, Quick as a Turtle's Wing, into thy Bosom, There brood and murmur, there sigh out my Soul, There find a sweeter, richer, brighter World. Birtha. Sure Nature form'd me softer than my Sex: Or else to make me worthier of my Heroe, She fil'd the ruder Particles away Which render us malicious, wayward, proud, And melted all my Passions into Love. Love forms alone my Heart; for oh! I feel, At every tender Word you speak, my Heart Flows at the Sound, and all dissolve within me. Gondibert. Sure thou art fairer, brighter than thy Sex; For while I gaze upon Thee, all my Spirits, Shoot to my Eyes, and press their Beams on thine. Nature has cast thee in a Mold of Heav'n: Such shining Beings, in the Midnight Hours, When Slumbers wave their fleecy Gold around us, Steal from their lucid Spheres to bless our Dreams, And, hovering, prompt the willing Mind to Virtue. We bless their Goodness, and almost adore Them. Birtha. O may the Hours for ever smile like this! For ever let me glory in your Love.â But who is yon that moves this Way? my Father? Gondibert. 'Tis He: I know Him by his reverend Port. Yet mark Him well; He seems immerst in Thought. Now with unequal Steps He measures o'er The level Green of yonder Walks; now stands, As if that Motion had forgot its Office, And with a steady Eye-Ball gains on Heaven, Till Contemplation have her fill. Whate're Employ his Thoughts, 'tis for the good of Man. Birtha. He moves, and looks this Way. Gondibert. Thou art so good, From Heav'n to Thee is but a small Transition. âI'll meet Him, and acquaint Him with our Passion. I hope He'll pity us, and crown our Wishes. Retire behind You breathing Sycamores, And, when he's gone, I'll meet and tell Thee all. [Exit Birtha. Gondibert Solus. [Gondibert.] May soft Persuasion arm my Tongue to move Him, And all the tender Eloquence of Love! May Paphian Honey melt in every Accent And steal into his Soul.âHear, O ye Gods! Make me but happy in the Maid I doat on, In beauteous Birtha, and a Spring of Incense Shall roll away in Odours from your Altars. SCENE III. GONDIBERT and ASTRAGON. Astragon, at some Distance. [Astragon.] What! Birtha yonder parting from the Duke! It must be so. I have observ'd of late Uncommon Alteration in my Daughter. Whene're I mention Gondibert, she blushes, But soon the Purple fades away to Paleness: A dying Langour swims upon her Eyes, And her whole Nature's chang'd. It must be Love. The Duke's made up of Honour, Truth, and Goodness, And might I glory in Him for a Son!â But that's too high Ambition. No; the Princess, So Fame reports, is by the King design'd To bless his Bed: and, sure, He's worthy of Her. I love the Duke too well to bar his Way To Empire, by advancing Birtha's Fortune?â But He's at Hand.âGood Heav'n preserve your Grace, May Fortune fan you with her softest Wing, May Peace and sweet Contentment wait around you, May sure Success for ever bless your Hopes, And pour the Balm of Gladness on your Heart. Gondibert. Good Astragon, your Wishes half are heard, And seal'd in Heav'n: the Ways of Peace are yours, Divine Contentment spreads her rosy Wing And constant hovers o'er your Walks. Yet still, Still may you add one Kindness to the Rest, And make me happier than the Sons of Men. Astragon. And is it in my Pow'r? I thank you, Gods, Here on my aged, bended Knees I thank you. But quickly speak, my Gondibert; unload Your secret Breast, and, by the Pow'r of Friendship, My Life, my all are yours. Gondibert. O wond'rous Virtue! O might I be ally'd to so much Goodness, Might I but call you, Father; then, O, then, Heav'n, here, cou'd add no Happiness to this. Astragon. What means my Gondibert? Gondibert. Oh beauteous Birtha! Amazing Brightness! were but Birtha mineâ Astragon. What? She?âthe Daughter of a poor Physician?â Impossibleâwhat Birtha touch my Heroe?â Poor, little Innocence!âIt cannot be.â I fear, my Lord, you laugh at your old Man. Gondibert. No, Astragan: I love her,âhow I love Her! Oh, She's the Soul of Goodness, all Perfection, And everlasting Joy is in her Arms. Astragon. This Rapture is the Blaze of youthful Blood, By Beauty kindled, by Enjoyment cool'dâ Gondibert. Forbid it, Reason; and forbid it Heav'n! My Love is Virtue, Purity and Truth, Cool as a Sage's morning Contemplation, Yet glowing as the Vestals Holy fires. Pour but the Marriage-Oil upon the Flame And in a sacred Blaze it mounts to Heav'n; If not, which all the Gods avert! It then Burns up my Life, and I am lost for ever. Astragon. Good Heav'n forbid, a Life so fair as yours, The Joy of Thousands, perish in its Bloom! No: may it flourish, like the goodly Cedar, Till Time grow old, and shed abroad its Odours To sweeten Earth, and entertain the Skies, With the rich Incence of a virtuous Name. Yet, call Reflection to your Aid, my Lord; For, while you honour Birtha with your Love, You sink beneath your Dignity and Fame: You stain the Current of your Blood, which teems, Rich in a Race of Heroes, through your Veins. Gondibert. I tell Thee, no: by mingling with her Virtues, A Stream of Crystal! I refine my Nature. For Beauty gilds a Crown with double Lustre, And Virtue lifts us nearer to the Stars. But shall I live? O say, is Birtha mine? For Life and She are so wound up in One, That every Pulse beats Musick at her Name; But if That Dear One, whom my Soul longs after, If She's deny'd, the Springs of Life stand still. Astragon. Live, and be happy! Gondibert. Blessings on the Sound! Astragon. Let Happiness and Birtha crown your Wishes! Gondibert. Not West-winds breathing o'er a Bank of Violets, Not the Love-labour'd Song of Nightingales, Not Sighs of Virgins in the Summer-Groves, At close of Eve, when, soft, their Lovers steal With Raptures to their Arms, are half so sweet As those dear Words, âLet Birtha crown your Wishes!â O Astragon! O more than Father to me! Thus give me leave in flowing Gratitude To pour th'Abundance of my Heart before you, My ravish'd Heart that leaps and bounds with Joy! Astragon. Joy streams into my Eyes to call you Son. New Tides of Vigour swell my wither'd Veins In sparkling Sallies.âI am young againâ Again I live in you, my Son, my Son! Rise but To-morrow, and the Holy Priest Shall make Her yours for ever! Gondibert. Rise! O Rise! Spring into Light, Thou 'Morrow's chearful Dawn, Ye Minutes, speed away! Thou lusty Sun, Drest, like a joyful Bridegroom, mount the East, In all thy richest Rays and gayest Gold: Nor shalt Thou see, in thy wide Circuit, One So blest as I shall be, or fair as Birtha. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. BIRTHA and THULA. Thula. Yesâyou are chang'd of late, my gentle Mistress, Your Actions, nay your very Looks are chang'd. No more you love to wake the sleeping Strings Into the sprightly Life of Harmony, Nor teach the Lute to dye away in Softness. No more you dip the Pencil, and diffuse A Blush or Smile upon the breathing Canvass, Nor trace a Flow'r along the snowy Lawn, Created by your Hand, the Pink or Violet. The purple Morn no more beholds you busy In culling Herbs to ease unhealthy Mortals. No more your wonted Songs provoke the Lark, The morning Lark, or Ev'ning Philomel, To answer you with less melodious Sweetness. Nay ev'n Devotion grows more languid in you; Your Bosom swells, but not with holy Ardour, And when your Eyes shou'd drink in Beams from Heav'n, They steal a Glance and melt on Gondibert. Your very Sighs, which us'd to rise like Incence, Grateful to Heav'n, and fragrant as the Morn, Now steem with Love, but not celestial Love: The Gods with Pity view your War of Passions, And as you mourn the Altars seem to tremble. Birtha. I dare commit the Secret to thy Ear, Tho' nothing but these Groves were trusted by me With the dear Truth; for oft to Them I whisper, In lowest Murmurs, which escape the Echoes, That Love and Gondibert possess my Soul. Yes, Thula, yes, that gallant, Godlike Stranger Beats in my Pulse and trembles in my Heart. And is He not deserving of my Love? Tell me, dear Thula, is He not deserving? So graceful is his Port, so sweet his Nature, So high in Glory, and so great in War, And yet so young, so passionately Loving, And glowing in his Vows; my yielding Heart, Without a Flutter, fled into his Bosom, Nor once, once wishes to return again. Thula. Believe me, Madam, tho' his Vows be glowing, It is the Art of those Deceivers, Men, With Oaths and Murmurs, soft as billing Doves, To sigh believing Maidens into Ruin. They'll pray, and weep as if they dy'd with Love, Besiege us with a Storm of burning Passion, Till we, too fondly, give our Treasure up, The Treasure of our Innocence and Beauty. Awhile they wanton with unbounded Freedom, And seem to pour away their Souls in Pleasure; But soon their Passion ebbs to cold, cold loathing; Then leave the helpless, poor, forsaken Kind-One To Grief, to Shame, and triumph in our Ruin. Birtha. By all the Powr's of Virtue, Love, and Honour, Now I cou'd chide Thee for this base Mistrusting. He's pure as Chastity, as Pity kind: My Gondibert! How can that godlike Youth, So full of Truth, of Tenderness and Goodness, Design the Ruin of the Maid that loves Him,? Or Falshood lodge in such a gallant Breast? Thula. Beneath the smiling Herbage of the Spring The Adder may be couch'd, nor once betray His spotted Skin, tillâ Birtha. Hold, nor wound his Virtue. Thula. Nay I believe your Gondibert as good, Tender, and true as any of his Sex; But still He's Man, and then-He may deceive you. Birtha. Hold, hold thy Peace: He's something more than Man. He looks a Deity: and lo! He comes Like radiant Truth! Suspicions fly before Him; Blush, Thula, blushâfor, know to thy Confusion, To-morrow's dawning Light shall see Us One. SCENE V. GONDIBERT, BIRTHA, THULA, Gondibert. My Birtha! now for I will call Thee mine, I long have sought Thee through these secret Shades, Through every Walk and Grotto, to disclose Our mutual Happiness. A Tide of Joy Bears down my Soul: the Gods are most propitious: Thy Father (O the Rapture turns my Brain!) Blesses our Passion and confirms our Love. Birtha. Is it the Voice of Gondibert, or Heav'n? For oh, thy Words are wing'd with heavenly Joys! Pardon me, Modesty, and Virgin-Shame, If here I clasp Him in my eager Arms, If here my heaving Bosom grow to his, If all my Wishes are dissolv'd in Love, And Thought be happily destroy'd with Rapture. Gondibert. Let but To-morrow come, and I'll reward Thee, For all this Flow of Tenderness and Love, With Faith unequal'd, and unbounded Joys. Thula. Indeed, my Lord, She well deserves Affection, Ev'n now She call'd you God, She doats upon you; She lives but on your Sight, She bleeds with Tenderness, And all her Soul o'erruns with Fondness to you. I did but hint at Man's Inconstancy, And Rage began to sparkle in her Eyes For Doubting of Your Virtue: nay, She chid me. Gondibert. And did She, Thula, did the Charmer chide Thee? O wond'rous Goodness! No, my Birtha, no; When I prove falseâbut 'tis impossible;â Ev'n were my Nature vile and giv'n to changing, Thy Beauty, matchless Beauty might reclaim me, Might fix me Thine, and thine alone for ever. And when this rebel Heart forgets to love, And beats with ought but Thee, may want o'ertake me, Contempt and Ruin haunt me through the World, And Guilt pursue me with a Whip of Scorpions. I love Thee in my Nakedness of Soul, Bare and unclouded with the Mask of Baseness. I'll be so very jealous of my Heart, That, shou'd another Woman enter in, I'd stab Her there; and do my Birtha Justice. Birtha. Enough, my Lord, my Life, my Soul, my Husband! For I will call you by that tender Name, The Spring of chaste Delight and long Endearments. And if the Gods be kind, I hope To-morrow, O Transport! I may truly call you so. Gondibert. The Marriage-Robe To-morrow shall infold Thee With purest White, the Emblem of thy Mind. Then, like a Zephyr o'er a Field of Spices, My Virgin-Bride, I'll whisper in thy Arms The Breath of Ecstasy; I'll murmur round Thee, Unfold thy Charms, and wanton in thy Sweetness. O drowning Bliss! I dye upon the Thought, I dye with Ravishment, and, oh, my Senses Are hurried down the Flood of swelling Joy, And swallow'd in the Ocean of thy Love. âLet me repose me on thy fragrant Breast, And lull me with the Musick of thy Voice, O sweetly lull my Senses into Calmness! For now my Spirits bound with wild Excess, An Agony of Bliss! Oh Birtha, oh!â Yet how on this soft Pillow of Delight, How on this Bosom can I rest from Rapture? Birtha. My Gondibert! but Language all is poor.â I'll answer you with Gazing, dart my Soul In Glances on you, till they twist their Rays With those kind Rays of yours, and melt together. Gondibert. Why, I cou'd gaze for ever on thy Beauties And look away my Soul into thy Eyes: Ev'n now it sickens, languishes to leave me, And longs to rise upon their Beams to Heaven. What art thou, Beauty? whence thy charmful Pow'r, To swell the Passions thus, and fire the Blood, With pleasing Madness, and delightful Fury? Beauty's the sweet, unfading Rose of Love, Which blooms diffusive on to endless Ages From Stock to Stock, in amiable Progress; And where it blooms creates eternal Spring. Beauty's a Recompence for all the Woes, A Counterpoise for all our Pains below. Beauty's the Essence of divine Perfection, A radiant Emanation of the Gods, The Smile of Innocence, the Blush of Virtue, The Light of Truth, the Harmony of Goodness, The Flow of spotless Love, the Ray of Honour, And, all in one, the very Soul of Woman! Of Woman, lovely, wond'rous, sacred Sex, The darling Masterpiece of smiling Nature, The fair Epitome of all that's good, The Wish of Wisdom, and the Joy of Sense, At once the Honour and the Proof of Heav'n! Thula. My Lord, the Hour of Pray'r is now at hand, And Astragon will wait.âThey heed me not. âMy Lord the Hour of Pray'râ Gondibert starting from his Rapture. [Gondibert.] 'Tis well observ'd. Yes, gracious Pow'r, we'll fly unto thy Altars With holy Fervour, and o'erflowing Hearts. To Thee we owe our Being; all the Good Which show'rs in dewy Plenty on Mankind, Riches, and Ease, and Honours flow from Thee. And, oh, Thou Fount of Life, to Thee I owe This Treasure of my Soul, my Birtha's Beauties. Still may thy Blessings thus descend upon us, Of Virtue, Peace, of Piety, Delight; And still be thus propitious to our Love. [Exeunt Gondibert and Birtha. Thula. Ha! UlfinoreâI'll steal into this Bow'r. [Thula retires. SCENE VI. Ulfinore Solus. [Ulfinore.] In vain I wander through the Shades and Gardens For Peace; the Shades and Gardens nourish Love. O Love, thou Serpent hid beneath the Flowr's Of rural Innocence, to sting our Quiet! How am I lost! The Venom burns me up. I pine away in Thought; I sink in Sorrows; And Hope, the smiling Flatterer of Grief, Ev'n Hope is distant from me, to extend A helping Hand, and raise Me from the Vale Of Misery: but dull and black Despair Sits heavy on my Soul and weighs it down. Why shou'd I think; for Thought must swell to Madness. O Birtha! lovely as the youthful Spring, When happy Nature, drest in Verdure, smiles! But Gondibert alone shall revel there: Luxurious Thought! to dwell upon her Sight; To drink the fragrant Dew from her moist Lip Breathing Delight; to clasp her yielding Waste; To melt upon her easy-swelling Bosom, Till the fond Soul flow all to Ecstasy And bubble up in Sighs!âO happy Gondibert! No wonder He neglects the Princess' Passion. But yet the KingâBy Heav'n the lucky Thought May dart a Beam of Comfort through the Gloom, And light me up to Joy: for well I know The King assumes the Pow'r to chuse a Bride For his Allies; and Gondibert so charms Him, He swore that none but He shou'd wed his Daughter. Wou'd the King knew but of their Loves, in time, Before that Marriage make Them one for ever; Still, still She might be mine! hush, Thula comes. SCENE VII. ULFINORE, THULA. Thula. What? ever musing in these lonely Shades? Some Beauty sure, must entertain your Mind, Some City-Fair; for, as I came along, Methought the Echoes seem'd to murmur Love. Ulfinore. 'Tis Love, 'tis more, 'tis almost Adoration. [Aside. No, gentle Thula, I was bred to war, And the rough Business of the Iron-field: No Beauty sheds a Softness o'er my Mind. The little God of Love's affraid of Arms: Whene're He spys a burnish'd Shield, or Helmet, Horrid with flaming Gold, He moves his Pinions, His downy Pinions to the rural Walks, And aims his Arrows at the blushing Maid, Easily won; or else delights to wound, The Shepherd, piping on the whiten'd Plains. But I was wond'ring at the grateful Peace, And Lassitude of quiet Bliss which reigns Here, far from Courts, within your happy Groves. Here I cou'd wish to dwell, but that my Duty To Gondibert must draw me from your Shades. Thula. Why, Ulfinore? Ulfinore. Because the royal Aribert, No doubt, will speedily invite my Lord, For now his Wounds are heal'd, unto the Court, And crown his Valour with the Princess' Beauty: For so the King designs. Thula. Forbid it, Love! The Duke with Oaths has promis'd beauteous Birtha To-morrow's rising Sun shall see Them one. Ulfinore. What mean thy Words? Thula. They cannot want a Meaning; To-morrow, holy Marriage makes Them One. Ulfinore. MarriageâTo-morrowâThou confounds me, Thula. Thula. Why, Ulfinore? She well deserves a Crownâ Ulfinore. True She is fair as Heavn's unsullied Face, And spotless as the Eye of Day: but thenâ Thula. What Then? Ulfinore. The King, I fearâ Thula. 'Tis well observ'd: But I'll acquaint Them with thy kind Suspicions, And hasten on their Marriage. Then, secure, They'll live the Life of Gods, nor fear the King, But grow immortal in each other's Arms. [Exit. Ulfinore Solus. [Ulfinore.] Then I am lost. To-morrowâwhatâno longer? No Time's allow'd to finish my Design. What shall I do? O whither, whither wander? Where can I find the thornless Paths of Peace? No Peace is left for Thee, unhappy Ulfinore. Why didst thou gaze upon her fatal Beauties? Why drink such pleasing Poison to thy Soul? And, oh, oh, whereforeâwherefore didst thou Love? Let dull Forgetfulness creep o'er thy Sense, And close her dazling Beauty from thy Thoughts: Yet still it flames in Fancy. Dye, then, dye: O mournful State when Death alone can ease me! But, tho' to Death I suffer, make Them Happy, Heav'n, make Them Happy!âAnd They must be so In one another's Arms!âYes hear my Prayers, Ye genial Deities, with Blessings crown Them As everlasting as their mutual Love! O may a little, pratling, beauteous Race Reward their soft Endearments, smile around Them, With all the Father's Virtue in their Minds, And all the Mother's Lustre in their Eyes, The Blossoms of their Joy, and Fruits of Love! Then, when I moulder in my silent Grave, And this rebellious Heart forgets to heave, May Birtha then with pious Pity mov'd, Shed one soft Tear, and say, âHow well He lov'd!â The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. ASTRAGON, ULFINORE, Philosophers, Servants, &amp;c. Astragon. Let Plenty walk around, and pour Herself Into the foaming Gold: the rosy Wine Shall laugh away our Cares and ill-tim'd Wisdom: Forget awhile to be severe, my Friends: Indulge the genial Hour;âTo-morrow sees My Birtha marry'd to the gallant Gondibert. Blest be the Holy Pow'r who rules our Actions, Who prompts our Minds to good, directs our Wills. And stems the Torrents of unlawful Passions. For sure the Love of Gondibert and Birtha Is lighted by a sacred Beam from Him, An Emanation of the God of Purity! O, may He thus continue still to bless Them With glowing Piety, with spotless Love, The Fatness of the Earth, and Dew of Heaven! [Exeunt Philosophers. To the Servants. Go crop the Virgin Beauties of the Spring, And crown the Altars with unsully'd Flowers, The vernal Blushes of luxuriant Nature, Sweet as the Breath of Morn: for Heav'n is pleas'd With humble Offerings from a grateful Heart, But yet requires them sweet and undefil'd. [Exeunt Servants. But Sorrow seems to mark thy Visage, Ulfinore, Amid this general Joy: what means that Sigh? A Face of Gladness wou'd become this Hour, When Pleasure waits upon thy gracious Lord, And opens all her nectar-flowing Springs To bathe Him in the Rivers of Delight. Ulfinore. I fear the Kingâ Astragon. What of the King, good Ulfinore! Ulfinore. The King design'd His Daughter for the Duke: And shou'd He marry Here, without his Leave Or ev'n his Knowlege, think, O think what Storms May crush this springing Joy, and blast its Sweetness. For Aribertâyou know not Aribert.â He's haughty, stern, unbounded in his Pow'r; His Temper stormy as the troubled Ocean, When warring Winds with high-wrought Billows rage, O'erturn the Deep and tempest all the Main. Tho' now He smiles on Gondibert, as mild As Ev'ning Suns, and gilds Him with his Favour; Yet shou'd Heâ Enter Servant. Servant. Sir a Messenger's arriv'd, And waits without: I think his Name is Tibalt. Ulfinore. Good Heav'n, improve my Wishes! [Aside. Astragon. Bid Him enter. Tibalt? a Stranger to my Ears. Ulfinore. I know Him: A Message from the Kingâ Astragon. A Message, sayst Thou?â A Message from the King:âan Icy Cold Stiffens my shivering Blood. I fear the Purpose: All-gracious Heav'n, avert these sad Forebodings! Ulfinore. My Peace and Life depend upon this Hour. [Aside. SCENE II. ASTRAGON, ULFINORE, TIBALT, Tibalt. My Alfinore! let me embrace my Friend, And strain Him to my Heart.âYour reverend Port And humble Dignity bespeak you Astragon: That good old Man whose Care and healing Labours Have piously restor'd to Life and Health, The noble Gondibert: for which the King, In Honour of your Virtue, comes to thank you. Ulfinore. What says my Tybalt? now I bless my Stars, My kind, propitious Stars that beam with Love. [Aside. Astragon. Too much He honours with his royal Presence The meanest of his Servants: but the Duke Is worthy to receive Him; I'll acquaint Him. Tibalt. But stay: a softer Message waits for Gondibert. Tell Him, the beauteous Rhodolinda comes, And, with a gallant Train of Worth and Beauty; Attends the King. Astragon. Poor Birtha! wretched Daughter! [Aside. Tibalt. Tell Him, the King designs to bless His Valour With Rhodolinda's melting Pomp of Charms. Astragon. Undone for ever! [Aside. Exit. Ulfinore. Happy, happy Ulfinore! [Aside. Tibalt. Tell Him, like Venus in her rosy Chariot, She comes to recompence Her God of War With softer Scenes, and sweeten all his Labours. âBut Astragon is gone: no doubt, He flew With joyful Haste, nor stay'd to hear the Rest, Before th'unfinish'd Period had discover'd The King's Munifence: He knew that Gondibert Would gladly thank Him for but half the Message. Now, Ulfinore, here's room to speak my Joy In thus beholding Thee again: for oft, Oft have I wish'd, when Pleasure fill'd my Heart, To make Thee Sharer, and divide the Bliss. For well I know, such is thy honest Nature, My Happiness wou'd make my Friend rejoice, And I am greatly happy, greatly so, Since I beheld Thee: I am marry'd, Ulfinore, Ulfinore. Marry'd? May Rapture dwell upon the Sound, Eternal Joy, and everlasting Love: For so I wish my Tibalt: yes, believe me, I wish thee all the Blessings of the Gods. But tell me, who, who is that dear one? Laura? Tibalt. Yes, charming Laura is at last my own: At last She list'ned to my tender Vows, And well rewards me for my Sorrows past. She waits upon the Princess.âHark! methought The Trumpet's sprightly Musick pierc'd my Ear: 'Tis so; the Notes come swelling on the Wind. The King's at Hand: I long to see my Laura, For every Minute is an Age to Lovers. Oh, 'tis a painful Interval of Time Between the parting and the meeting Hour. Come, Ulfinore. Ulfinore. I comeâto thank the Gods For this most dear and unexpected Mercy. [Aside. SCENE III. BIRTHA and THULA. Birtha. A strange Variety divides my Soul: Now smiling Hope with golden Pinions fans me, Now Terror chills my Blood. I find a Sigh Unbidden stealing from my inmost Breast, And agonizing Tremblings shake my Frame:â Again my Spirits nimbly dance their Rounds, Warm rolls the purple Tide of Life again, And all is Peace within. Begone, my Fears, Nor dare to enter where the charming Youth, Where Gondibert, without a Rival, reigns The Object of my Soul. Thula. These doubtful Passions Perplex the Ignorance of wishing Maids, Who pant for something, yet they know not what, They long, indeed, but tremble at their Longing, Lost in a Sweet, uncertain Expectation: But when the loving Bridegroom fills their Arms, All Doubts dissolve away, and Joy alone Possesses every Thought: the flaming Blood In sallying Tumults revels through the Heart, A painful Ecstasy oe'rflows their Senses, And leaves them dying in the Throbs of Love. Birtha. You seem experienc'd in the Bridal-waysâ Thula. Yes, I have readâ Birtha. In deed I fear too much. Such warm Expressions!âVirgin Modesty Must veil itself in Blushes at thy Talk. Thula. Your Gondibert, and Night will hide your Blushes. Birtha. Thula, for shame! nor violate my Ears.â No wanton Wish has ever stain'd my Thoughts So deep, as call the Blood into my Cheek. And tho' I love my Gondibert as much, As tenderly as ever Maiden lov'dâ Yet may I never know the Joys of Marriage If ought but purest Sanctity, as spotless As Chastity Herself, inflam'd my Breast. Thula. Excuse me, bright Perfection! for I found A Heaviness upon your Heart, and hop'd To chase the Gloom away with smiling Language. Birtha. Ah me! Thula. What means that Sigh? Birtha. And did I sigh? Thula. You did, and you look pale: the Roses languish That shed a chearful Beauty o'er your Features. I fear you are not well: dear Madam, tell me: O tell me: is your Pain about your Heart? Or where? that I may fly to help my Mistress. Birtha. A sudden Damp of Spirits; that was all: But I am easy now; indeed I am. Enter Servant. Servant. Madam, the King, and with Him Rhodolindaâ Birtha. Oh! Oh!â [Swoons away. Thula. She faints.âHeav'n, take Her to thy Care! To the Servant. Hereâbend her forward, while I chase her Temples. O Birtha! O my Mistress!âBut again The fragrant Breathâit hovers o'er her Lips, Her Eyes lift up their sickly Lids again And languishingly steal into a Sparkle. Her Pulses beat; and Beauty's orient Red Flows to her Cheeks afreshâShe lives again. Birtha. He will not, sure, forsake me; his poor Birtha. No: Gondibert is Dovelike in his Nature; Is made of Truth!âwe'll live among the Lillies: Soft-spicy Gales shall waft us to Elysium, To Beds of Roses, and to Groves of Myrtle! No Rhodolinda shall disturb us there. âAh, Thula! where? where am I? where is Gondibert? My Gondibert? methought He lov'd me well, And swore He wou'd be true. Thula. He will be true: Compose yourself: all will be well again: Dear Madam, we'll retire into your Chamber: All will be well againâHe will be true. SCENE IV. ARIBERT, GONDIBERT, ASTRAGON. Aribert. Thy Actions, Gondibert, were so conspicuous That Fame employ'd Her hundred Tongues to spread Them, And charm'd the Ears of Envy with thy Valour. When all the Battle glow'd, and bloody War Frown'd horrible; when Shrieks and dying Groans, Tormenting dismally in Peals the Air, Roll'd, as the Murmurs of Despair, along, And Spears, like Light'ning, blasted half the Field; Yet then, ev'n then, thy gallant Spirit press'd Thee To pierce the Cloud of Death, to dare all Danger, To pour thy Thunder where the thickest bled, To bleed thyself, till Victory with Tears Deform'd her Smiles to see her Heroe's Wounds. Gondibert. Too much you Honour with your royal Praise My humble Deeds in Warâ Aribert. I know thee modest, Nor will offend Thee with the glorious Truth, Thou excellent Young Man!âThy Father's Soul Beams in thy Looks; the Soul of my old Friend. And when I see Thee, I am warm'd again Into the dear Remembrance of my Youth; When oft with Him I launc'd the foaming Boar, Or rush'd into the Bowels of the Battle: Or in the midnight Dance, and courtly Ball Sigh'd on the trembling Hand of blushing Beauty And Sighing have prevail'd. But, ah, those Days, Those happy Days and Nights are vanish'd long. Old Men can only meditate with Pleasure On the past Joys of Youth, and wish, in vain, The former sprightly, gay, and lusty Years, When every Prospect smil'd, wou'd glide again A Revolution of returning Bliss. But Thou art in thy Prime: the Blood of Youth Now dances briskly in the crimson Channels: The Season of Delight! And since thy Wounds, (Thanks to the Care of Astragon) are heal'd, The Court and Beauty may be grateful to Thee. Gondibert. Eternal Thanks are due, my royal Master, To this obliging, condescending Goodness. But well I know the polish'd Gallantry, The easy Gayety which shine in Courts Can never suit a Soldier bred in Camps, Unpractis'd in the Art of ought but War. The gaudy, wanton, smiling, dancing Courtier Wou'd only laugh, and wonder at my Awkerdness. No: send me to the Field, when Business calls; There send me, and my Life shall gladly bleed To serve my Master, Liberty, and Country. But now, with your Permission, I'd retire Unto these Shades, and learn the Works of Nature, Turn o'er the Volumes of the sage and good, And here philosophise with Astragon: This Life is better suited to my Temper. Aribert. By Heav'n, Thou art injurious to thyself: That Form of thine was made to charm the Women; For Strength and Harmony are blended there. I well remember, for it is not long, Before the Battle call'd Thee from the Court, Before these manly Graces flourish'd in Thee, When Gondibert pass'd by, the Ladies sicken'd, And blest Thee with their Eyes; ev'n Rhodolinda, My Daughter Rhodolinda languish'd for Thee. Gondibert. Let not the Lord my King thus mock his Servant. Aribert. Mock Thee? I tell Thee, Gondibert, thy Virtue, And Grandour of thy Soul have greatly charm'd me: And by the Pow'r I serve I swear, my Daughter Shall take Thee to her Bed, her Lord and Husband. Astragon. Oh, there He falls: oh Birtha, oh! my Daughter. [Aside. Gondibert. O never, never! What? your Rhodolinda, My Princess wed her Slave? far be it from me, Far be it from me thus to stain her Beauties, To sully thus the Lustre of your Crown. I will not, dare not aimâWhile crowding Kings With Transport lay their Hearts and Crowns before Her. No! at an humble Distance let me wait And thank the Gods for Forming so much Beauty. I'd venture Life in Honour of her Virtue, But wou'd not live to sacrifice my Princess To my Delight, tho' Heav'n is in her Arms;â Too much I honour and regard her Happiness. Astragon. O matchless Truth! and more than mortal Goodness! [Aside. Aribert. Thy great Humility has urg'd in vain. I know thy Passion will be welcome to Her. I know how sweet thy Name and Virtues sound In Rhodolinda's Ear: when late I mention'd This my Design, a various Glow of Blushes Ran flushing through her Face, and dy'd her Cheeks In Love's own purple Dress; She stole a Sigh; A lucid Softness dy'd upon her Eyes, And every Look and Gesture spoke her Love. But we will leave Thee:âTibalt, call the Princess. âIt shall be soâhave done.âCome, worthy Astragon, In the mean time, I'll view thy House and Gardens, For they are fam'd for Beauty and Design: An elegant Simplicity conspires With Nature to command our Admiration, And pleases better than the swelling Pride Of marble Domes and sculptur'd Alabaster. SCENE V. GONDIBERT, RHODOLINDA, LAURA. Gondibert. Ambition reaches out a Crown in vain, To raise me into Misery for ever. Cease, gilded Bait, to swim before my Eyes; My Love is fixt and stedfast as the Pillars Which prop the Sky: Ambition, cease to tempt me; Thy Efforts all are light as empty Air. âMy Birtha's dearer than ten thousand Crowns, Tho' every Crown was spangled o'er with Stars, And golden India ripen'd all Her Mines Beneath its Pow'r.âBut how shall I behave, Or how disguise my Passion from the Princess. She must expect a softer, warmer Meeting Than I have Pow'r to give. This, this perplexes. âI cannot now avoid her ill-tim'd Visit: No; if I shou'd, her Anger might arise And ruin all my Hopes: I must receive Her; I must; but yet I need not mention Love: With awful Reverence I'll seem to greet Her, And, after formal Complements, retire Submissively; then silent steal to Birtha, And crown our Vows with Marriage:âsure, the Princess, When Marriage has united us, will pity us, Nor hurl the Bolt of Vengeance at Our Love: Softness becomes Her Sex. But then the Kingâ His Rage, at my Refusal, may undo us:â Good Heav'n, direct me in this doubtful Hour, O safely lead me through this Maze of Ruin, For I resign our Loves unto thy Care: Look down with Mercy: Birtha's Innocence May hope Protection from thy righteous Hand!â But Rhodolinda comes, and Laura with Her. Hail, royal Maid! whose Beauty, like the Sun, Disdains not thus to shine on all alike. This Visit might detain a fleeting Soul, Just on the Wing to Heav'n, and call it back To stay awhile and wonder at your Goodness: Might bid the Hearts of Princes beat with Pride: But when vouchsaf'd to me, your humblest Vassalâ Rhodolinda. My Lord, you'r not so much indebted to me; For ev'n without the Orders of the King, The Gratitude, and Friendship which I owe The brave Defender of my Father's Throne, Had brought me thus to thank you for your Service. Gondibert. Alass, my Service, Madam, was but trifling; What every honest Man shou'd pay his King, And only can deserve the Name of great, Since you are pleas'd to raise it with your Praises. To be rewarded thus, might teach a Coward To flame with Valour, rush on certain Death, And thank the Gods who made his End so glorious. For not the generous Poet's golden Pen, Dip'd in Eternity, and dropping Life, Cou'd give the Heroe half so high a Fame, As when you gild his Actions with your Tongue. I fear She loves: I see it in her Eyes; They swell on Mine, and Love is pregnant in Them. Rhodolinda. But what if Rhodolinda shou'd dispence Superiour Favours to her graceful Warriour. Excuse me, Modesty, and hide my Blushes. [Aside. Gondibert. Impossible: your Praises are too high; They lift the Soul aboveâWhat shall I say? [Aside. Rhodolinda. What if the Princess whom you say you honourâ Gondibert. Madam, I fear I violate your Goodness With tedious Service, and detain your Beauties From spreading out their Beams and kindly Influence, And comforting the Earth with Light and Joy. May bounteous Heav'n Show'r all its Blessings on you. [Exit. SCENE VI. RHODOLINDA, LAURA. Rhodolinda. He's gone: nor wou'd He listen to my Love. Patience direct me! to be left so coldly! Left, when I just was pouring out my Heart In Words which might have been Ambrosia to Him: For which ev'n Kings had laid there Scepters by, And thought themselves more blest to drink them in, Than if the Queen of Beauty had caress'd them, Unloos'd her Charms, and giv'n up all her Sweetness. What can He mean? some other Virgin charms Him: It must be so?â Laura. Some other Virgin charm Him? What radiant Image can employ his Heart, When once your Eyes have let out Day upon Him? Impossible: She shou'd be all a Goddess: Her Cheeks shou'd glow with Roses, deep as those Which glister in the Eastern Fields of Heav'n, And shed the purple Morning from their Blushes: Her Lips shou'd breath Delight. Rhodolinda. I pray thee hold, Nor praise thy Mistress' Beauty, but assist Her. I think myself as fair as any She That ever held the captive World in Chains: And shou'd anotherâpoison to my Thoughtsâ But sure He cannot be so dull, so senseless, As thus neglect a Crown and Rhodolinda, To languish in another's humble Arms:â Yet shou'd He, by the Anguish of my Soul Which bleeds with Indignation and with Love, Her Life shall forfeit, what Her Beauty gain'd. But how to find the Secret: there's the Question. Laura. The only Way, my Thoughts present, is this. My Husband, and the Duke's Companion, Ulfinore, Were born together and together bred, In early Friendship and most strict Alliance. The Duke reposes all his Bosom in Him, And shou'd He love, which I can scarce believe, Yet shou'd He, Ulfinore must know his Passion, The Progress of it and the fatal Object. Tybalt, no doubt, may wind into his Heart; And then the Secret's ours. But I'll instruct Him. Rhodolinda. Let me embrace thee, Laura; dear, dear Laura! Thy Words are balm, and Comfort dawns upon me. But I'll retire, and with Impatience wait Till Time unbosom this mysterious Turn. Seek Tybalt, and discover what thou can To ease thy Mistress, and restore her Peace. Distracted with Variety of Pain, Love, Rage and Madness fire my tortur'd Brain. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Scene I. GONDIBERT, BIRTHA, Gondibert. I feel myself more light, my Spirits flow Serener on, and Life is less a Burthen, Since I have made this Vow to marry Birtha. But I will go to comfort the poor Mourner, Who weeps and groans in Bitterness of Spirit. For, Thula tells me, when She heard the News Of Rhodolinda, Life forgot its Office; She dy'd away with tender Fears, and sigh'd With all the piteous Harmony of Sorrow: Then sought her Chamber, but with tottering Steps, To hide her Woes in solitary Darkness.â Methinks I hear Her Sighs:âIt must be so: I hear them softly breathing on my Ears, Sad as the Nightingales melodious Woe In gentle Even-Tide, when Westwinds shake The new-blown Roses from their balmy Wings: All-night She sings the Absence of her Mate, While Sorrow pricks her Breast, and fondest Love Mistakes Him ever lost.âLike kindly Dew I'll steal upon this lovely-drooping Flow'r, And wake it into Smiles: And, see, She comes, In all the Beauty of Distress.âMy Birtha! Birtha. What Voice is that, which in so sweet an Accent Dare call upon so lost a Thing as I am? They say, Compassion, in this Age, is cold. Gondibert. My Birtha! [She sees Him. Birtha. Oh! And is it you, my Lord? Indeed its kind to visit the distrest. If Comfort cou'd diffuse her golden Dawn On Grief so black as mine, it wou'd be now. Your Presence ever blest my Eyes with Gladness, Joy prun'd his purple Wings when you appear'd, And waited on your Smiles.âYes I remember Those dear, white Hours. But now it is not so: For, ah, I grieve the more to see you here, So much my Heart is careful for your Peace, Lest Sorrow prove infectious and you catch it. And Sorrow shou'd be foreign to that Face, When Rhodolinda opens all her Beauties To charm my Lord, and crown his Soul with Joy. Gondibert. Why wilt thou break my Heart with mourning thus? And why be so unkind, so very cruel As thus distrust my Constancy and Love? No, Birtha, no: were Rhodolinda fair As summer Skies, when not a Cloud deforms The blue Expanse, but all is spotless Beauty Fring'd with celestial Streams of sunny Gold: Cou'd Rhodolinda place beneath my Feet The Stores and Realms which Juno promis'd Paris; Yet, by the Softness of thy Soul, I swear, I'd quit them all for Thee: tho' meagre Want, And baleful Misery besieg'd my Way, I'd venture on, I'd catch Thee in my Arms, I'd feed upon thy Beauties, smile at Poverty, And think the Gods were kind in giving Thee. Birtha. Ascend, ye Lover-Spirits, from Elysium And sing this wond'rous Truth.âAmazing Constancy! O Birtha, thou art quite undone with kindness, And Admiration swallows up my Soul. [After Pausing. And can you think, my Lord, to stay with me? For me, to quit the royal Rhodolinda? It is too much, your Virtue is too bounteous: I am unworthy, quite unworthy of You. No; take Her, take the lovely, loving Princess, And Heav'n incircle You with sumless Joys! Gondibert. What means my Birtha? Birtha. I absolve my Lord, Yes, I absolve you from your Vows and Faith. Why shou'd I ruin such unbounded Goodness, And why, why stand between a Crown and You! No: leave me to my Sadness; do, my Gondibert! Ascend the royal Bed of Rhodolinda: While I consume my solitary Days In some forsaken Cave, or wayless Wild, Where misery wou'd chuse her dreary Dwelling; There will I teach the Streams to murmur âGondibert;â The Birds shall learn to whisper the dear Name, And every Echo sooth me with the Sound: There beg of Heav'n in never-ceasing Pray'rs To bless you both with everlasting Love. Gondibert. I pray thee, hold; nor wound me to the Soul: For while thou talk'st thus to me, see, my Eyes Swell into Tenderness, and flow with Sorrow. Birtha. My Lord, I speak the Language of my Heart, For tho' Heav'n knows I dye upon the Thought, (Yes, while I think, the Weight of Death is on me.) Tho' all the Sum of Bliss my Fancy form'd In golden Dreams, and happier Days, depended On you alone, the Cordial of my Life, Joy of my Sense, and Comfort of my Soul: Yetâoh!âsince Heav'n will have it so, I yield; I give myself to Wretchedness for ever, With all the Fondness of a dying Lover. By the chaste Splendours of the Moon I swear, That gild yon Orange Grove with silver Softness, By every Star that burns around her Throne, The solemn Witnesses of both our Loves, I'd rather part for ever from my Lord, For ever part, than bar your Way to Greatness. The King enrag'd, shou'd you refuse the Princess, May let the Fullness of his Fury fall Upon us both, and crush us both to Ruin: Rather than both,âupon my Knees I beg it, I beg it by these Tears, let Birtha suffer, And, if I save You, Ruin will be pleasing. 'Tis more than Happiness to die for You. Gondibert. Thou Soul of Goodness, how shall I reward Theeâ Or how admire thy Virtues as I ought? They stream in such Variety of Light, My Senses all are dazzled with the Glory. Whether the Lustre of thy Mind or Face, The Beauty of thy Sorrow, or thy Joy, Come o'er my Thoughts they equally surprise me. Thus have I seen the many-colour'd Dove Sport in the Blaze of Day: his changeful Neck Waves beaming round a Rainbow of Delight: The Purple varys into glossy Gold, The Gold into the Robe of smiling Spring, As different Points of Light present a Chain Of transient Colours glancing on the Sun: But whether Purple, Gold or Green diffuse Alternate Rays, the Green, the Gold, the Purple With equal Pleasure, but with varied Beauties And bright Confusion entertain our Eyes. Birtha. Oh me!â Gondibert. Be comforted, the Gods are good, Are kind to Virtue, and delight in Mercy; And Heav'n, I hope, has Blessings yet in Store, To lap us in Elysiums of Love, And recompence the Miseries we taste of. This Hour I mean to make thee mine for ever, The holy Priest will meet us in thy Chamber, By my Appointment, and receive our Vows. Then Birtha! Birtha. O my Lord, I fear. Gondibert. No moreâ Birtha. But shou'd the Kingâconsider O my Lord! Gondibert. None but the holy Priest shall know the Secret: To-morrow's Light will further open to us The King's Design: and shou'd He still persist, Then, Birtha, then, my Soul, we'll fly together, Together to some distant Realm we'll fly, Where Aribert shall never more disturb us; There sweetly roll away our Life in Love, Blest in each other, and grow old in Joy. Birtha. And will you then forsake a Crown for me? O thinkâ Gondibert. My Birtha, Crowns are Trifles to Thee. Birtha. Then here I give myself to You and Heav'n. Gondibert. O bounteous Gift!âHeav'n make me worthy of Thee. And, Thou, the God of Purity and Love, Whose Pow'r is infinite, protect thy Servants: O snatch us from the Malice of our Fortune, And lead us to the quiet Ways of Peace. O save us; we resign ourselves to Thee. SCENE II. ULFINORE, TIBALT. Tibalt. You strive in vain to hide your Sorrows from me, Your Words, your Silence equally betray you. Your Cheeks are tinctur'd with the yellow Plague Of Jealousy, which marks you for her Conquest. If Friendship may relieve you speak your Grief, My Counsel may direct you to the Port Of sweet Contentment and the Paths of Peace; Or is my Friendship and its Proffers slighted? My Hours were tedious tho' possess'd of Laura, Till Ulfinore was Master of the secret: My Happiness ev'n suffer'd a Stagnation, Pent up within my Breast, till I cou'd open The Sluices of my Joy to Thee, my Friend, And pour the copious Stream upon thy Bosom: Yet Tibalt is neglected by his Ulfinore. Ulfinore. No, witness, Heav'n! thy Friendship is my Glory: But what avail its kindly Care and Wishes? Despair forbids all Cure. Tibalt. But why Despair? If Love possess Thee, Love may be procur'd, If Honour bleed, thy Honour may be heal'd; I'll plead thy Passion, or I'll fight thy Cause, Prevail in Both, or dye to give thee Comfort. Ulfinore. Wou'd I had dy'd in Battle! e're my Eyes Beheld her fatal Beautiesâbut She's lost, For ever gloriously lost to me.â Yes, Gondibert alone cou'd merit Birtha. Tibalt. Hah!âGondibert and BirthaâThy Despair, Black with a baleful Humour, turns thy Brain; Say rather Gondibert and Rhodolinda. For so thy Purpose means;âand Heav'n has will'd. Ulfinore. The King might will it so; but, Tibalt, Heav'n, Heav'n to reward his Virtues gives Him Birtha. A Kingdom had been less with Rhodolinda. Tibalt. Amazement chains my Tongue.âBut did She spurn Thee, Despise thy Passion, and disdain thy Vows? No doubt She did, when Gondibert ador'd Her. Ulfinore. I never told my Love, I never own'd it. The secret Serpent, folded in my Brain, Shot all his Stings, or twisting round my Heart Drank my warm Life-Blood there. And let Him riot, The purple Currents are well-nigh exhausted; My Torments too will end when They are dry. Tibalt. Heav'n knows I pity Thee and wou'd relieveâ Ulfinore. I know Thou wou'dst: But leave me to my Fate, Since Death alone must ease me: For I swear I wou'd not if I might possess my Wishes, Nor violate my Master's matchless Goodness; He lives alone in Her and She in Him; Hope were Ingratitude, and wishes Sin; I cut Them off, and gladly plunge in Ruin. Tibalt. Illustrious Sufferer! Thy Virtues shine Fairer through Misery and gild Destruction. But lo! the King, He seems to bend this Way, And Astragon attends Him, with his Friends The grave Philosophers. Let us retire. [Exeunt. SCENE III. KING, ASTRAGON, PHILOSOPHERS. King. The Wonders I have heard and seen surprise me. The Life of Knowledge is the Life of Bliss. What Scenes of Glory open on my Mind With new Delight, which Ignorance had veil'd! How often I beheld yon azure Vault, The spangel'd Firmament, and glittering Host Of Stars innumerable sparkling round, With cold Neglect and stupid Inattention? Till You, ye Sons of Wisdom and of Virtue, Dispel'd the Gloom and lighted up my Soul. Astragon. The Firmament's a Volume fair display'd With sacred Characters that shine Conviction, And glorify their Maker in their Courses: There's not a single Spark but glows with Praises; The Spheres harmonious roll the glorious Hymn, Tun'd to the golden Harps of winged Flames, From World to World, and burn with Adoration. King. O wou'd some God but purge th'obstructed Ear, What elevating Musick might surround Th'inferior Globe with symphonising Peals Of Melody celestial, Orbs to Orbs Sweet quiring, and exalt the Soul to Heav'n! 1. Philosopher. Heav'ns Ordinances, Royal Sir, are just, And suited to the present State of Man. This radiant Scale of Music meets the Eye Not meant to pierce the Ear. Our feeble Organs Confounded while the Constellations sing, As if ten thousand Thunders burst around, Wou'd faint beneath the Melody divine. Th'ethereal Roll of loud resounding Spheres Wou'd stun if not unloose the World below. Astragon. So much the rather let us strive to tune These little Worlds ourselves to righteous rule, Compose Them to the Harmony of Virtue, Assuage the Tumults of rebellious Passions, And teach Subjection to our Foes within. Thus fitted to the Laws of Good and Just Shall universal Order rule the Whole, Our Souls be Music and our jarring Bodies Obedient to the Music of our Souls. So Peace shall wave her Olive Branches o'er Us And Concord bind Us in her golden Chain. King. I cou'd for ever hear You. O how blest Had been my Fortune, O what Joys unmix'd, What Days of Innocence, what Nights of Rest, The Brow unclouded and the Breast serene, If Heav'n had plac'd me in these Seats of Science, Of Purity, Contentment, Health and Peace! For Royalty too oft, the Gaze of Ideots, The Pageantry of Guilt and splendid Danger, This Royalty I say is rais'd on high, Only to sink beneath its Weight of Grandeur. 2. Philosopher. Few Monarchs like yourself are born to bless An happy People, in their Princes happy. That King is only great who rules by Goodness. Justice supports but Mercy fills his Throne: Tho' Gold and Jewels flame around his Temples The Wreath of Virtue is his brighter Crown. 3. Philosopher. His Throne, establish'd in his Subject's Hearts, Nor overthrown by Foes nor sap'd by Treason, Shall flourish still unmov'd and stand unshaken, Firm as the Pillars of the Earth and lasting. Astragon. Such are the Blessings which attend on Kings Who reign in Righteousness, like royal Aribert, By Mortals honour'd and approv'd by Heav'n. King. For Virtues such as these I choose the Duke The gallant Gondibert to wed my Daughter. Tho' Young, his Name is mighty in the Field: Thrice He repell'd my Foes and thrice He stain'd Our silver Adice with hostile Purple, Victorious in his March. Nor less his Skill In Counsels and the Mysteries of State. Beneath his Rule my People, all my Care, May live secure and happy. For myself, Since Age unnerves this Arm and damps my Brain, Unequal now alike to War or Counsels, Times hoary Victim, gladly I resign My Crown and Scepter to his Brow and Hand, To glory there afresh with pristine Lustre. Astragon. Yet hear your faithful Servant, royal Sir, Tho' Time has snow'd his venerable Honours Upon your sacred Head, still unimpair'd Your Wisdom might direct a larger Kingdom, Your Virtues still may bless your loving People, Who long to live and die beneath your Sway. King. Yes, Astragon, my People are my Children, Their King's and Father's Blessing shall await Them, Till Death forbid. But Gondibert must share The Honours with the Troubles of my Crown. Ease is the Balm of Age. My Years demand The Comforts of Retirement and of Peace. The Fire which kindled up my Soul to Fame And Deeds of Prowess languishes within me. His ardent Spirits like an active Flame Shall warm his Subjects, but consume his Foes. My Laurels, well-nigh faded with the Frosts Of seventy Winters, shall revive anew Transplanted to his Brows, again shall flourish, And gather Verdure from his youthful Spring. But come, my Astragon, and you, my Friends, My Daughter Rhodolinda will expect me. With you conversing, Time on Feet of Down Pac'd unperceiv'd away, so sweet the Hours By sacred Wisdom led! It must be late; For lo the Moon, which only seem'd to tip The Summits of the Grove, advanc'd in Glory Now pours a silver Deluge o'er the Night, Near mounted to her Noon.âPerhaps my Daughter May be retir'd; for early at the Dawn, I order'd our Departure for Verona, To celebrate the Nuptials: so good Night. Astragon. Permit us to attend you to your Chamber; That done, we'll beg of Heav'n to bless your Slumbers Humbly before the Altar. King. Thank your Goodness: The pious Prayers of holy Men like you Are powerful Intercessors with kind Heaven, They rise in Incence and descend in Blessings. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. RHODOLINDA, LAURA. Rhodolinda. Am I despis'd for Birtha then, for Birtha? Patience, I give Thee to the FiendsâConfusion. Laura. This very Hour my Husband gain'd the Secret From Ulfinore, who dies himself for Birtha. Rhodolinda. Hah! am I Rhodolinda, am I Daughter To Aribert and Heiress of the Crown Of Lombardy and scorn'd? How am I fall'n! Perdition seise her Beauties, Lightnings blast Themâ A Princess I, and SheâMy Soul's on Fire, Nought but her Blood shall quench it: come, Revenge, From thy black Cave; I feel thy Serpents here, They Hiss me into Madness. Live? She shall not, Not breath another Hour, by Hell She shall not, Tho' Nature sunk in Ruins at her Fall. For Gondibert, I scorn Him and myself I scorn, for losing but one Thought upon Him. O Pusillanimous! O abject Slave! Slave to a Girl, a Village Girl! By Heav'n I triumph in the meanness of thy Spirit. Go, wed Her, She alone is worthy of Theeâ But yet the Sorceress, the smiling Sorceress, Shall She escape?âI'll stab Her in his Arms. Laura. Madam compose Yourself, this Storm of Passion Shakes every Nerve, and ruffles all your Form. Acquaint your Father. Rhodolinda. Yes, the King shall know it, Shall know his Baseness: His paternal Careâ âYet shou'd the Weakness of old Age betray Him To pity Them and pardonâIf He shou'd, Still there are Daggers, PoisonâHence away; I know the sage Urganda will assist me: This Moment seek her Cave, and fetch her Poisons, That Fate may be secureâThis Moment, Laura.â Destruction, lead me on; I'll follow Thee. The Furies shall their Nuptial Torches bear, And big with fell Revenge I'll meet Them there. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Scene I. Gondibert. Hail Marriage! Fountain of unsullied Bliss, Descending from above, to quench the Thirst Of Holy Love, and bathe the Soul in Sweetness. Hail Hymeneal Rose, without a Thorn! How have thy Leaves distill'd into my Heart Their balmy Dews, as pleasant as the Drops Which softly fall upon our Fields and Hills. But see the beauteous Partner of my Life, My Birtha moves this Way. Her modest Cheeks With rosy Virtue flame, and speak her Thoughts As bright and spotless as the golden Lamps Which burn before the sacred Throne of Love. Scene Fourth. Gondibert, Birtha. Birtha. My Lord, my Gondibert, it was not kind To leave me thus alone, so soon to leave me, For I cou'd dwell for ever in your Sight, Live on your Looks, or dye within your Arms. But you'll forgive me while I thus complain, For 'tis Excess of Love, it is, believe me: Love overflows my Heart, inflames my Pulse, Beats with my Life, and mingles with my Soul. Gondibert. Good Heav'n! what Blessings has thy Mercy pour'd On thy unworthy Servant!âO My Birtha, Thy Love is Wonderful, surpassing far The Love of Women! Vestal Maids might own it, And learn from thine to glow with purer Fires. Here I had sought the Bosom of the Grove To wonder at thy Charms, to feed my Heart In Meditation on Thee, and to thank In humble Pray'rs the Gods for giving Thee! For, trust me, while I stand blest in thy Presence, Such ardent Tumults of severe Delight Astonish all my Soul, that nought is left To shew the boundless Virtue of my Love But dying Gazes, Sighs, and speechless Raptures. Birtha. The Language of the Soul! no Tongue can speak it: O Love! thy Thoughts are painted to the Eye; Each Motion has the Force of Eloquence, And nothing in us, but our Tongues, is silent.â Support me, Gondibert, I faint with Rapture. Gondibert. Methinks I am a real Atlas, thus While I support my BirthaâHeav'nly Burthen! Ambition! how I spurn thee!âAnd I swear The Flame of Glory, and the shouting Field, The golden Chariot, and attending Princes Who bit their Chains to swell the Triumph high, Cou'd never pour such Transports on my Heart, As now I feel, thus clasping Thee!âFarewel All future Thoughts of War: farewel, my Arms, Which spread a burnish'd Horror o'er the Fields, I give you up to rust. No more the Foe Shall tremble at the nodding of my Plumes; And Death no more look grimly pleas'd to see Her griesly Empire growing by my Sword. No Sights but Beauty now shall charm my Eyes, No Sounds but Sighs be pleasing to my Ears, And nought but Birtha triumph in my Heart. Birtha. And by the gentle Pow'r of Love, I never, O never tasted Joy compar'd to this Through all my Virgin-Life. Your Words are Honey Distilling from your Lips, and feed my Soul. Your Silence and your Words both charm alike. O may our Bliss continue thus to roll, A long, a soft, uninterrupted Stream, Nor vext with Troubles, nor the Storms of Life; Till having run through Meadows, green Retreats, And peaceful Vales, refining as it runs, It meet the Ocean of Eternity, There lose itself in never-ending Love. Gondibert. My Heart has form'd as fair a Scene of Joy. For I have call'd to mind a Seat of Safety Low in a Vale, and distant from the Court, Where Peace and Innocence wou'd chuse a Dwelling: Where Pleasure smiling roves through blooming Bowers, Through flowery Fields, through silver-rolling Streams, And dips in rosy Dews her purple Wings. In those soft Scenes of Love and rural Silence, Where Nature laughs, a Wilderness of Sweets! There lives a good old Man, my Father's Friend, I know He gladly will receive us both. We'll fly to Him, nor hear of Danger more. There like two Vines we'll grow and curl together, Swell into Ripeness, blossom into Joy! The Sun shall sooth us with his sweetest Beams, No Winds, but spicy Gales, refresh our Noons, No Birds, but Turtles, warble in our Shades, And Love Himself shall wave his Banner o'er us: While Truth, and Joy, and Hope, a smiling Train, Sport round, and fan us with their shining Plumes. âYou tremble and look pale:âWhy starts my Love? âWhat sudden Change is this? Birtha. Behold the Guards; Protect us, Heav'n! I dread the fatal Consequence. Gondibert. Heav'n will protect Thee: Let us meet the Storm, I'll either save my Love or perish in it. SCENE II. Enter Tibalt and Guards. Gondibert. What mean these Guards, and Tibalt in Disorder? You seem to labour with some mighty Message That's big with Fate: whate're it be declare it. Tibalt. Unwilling we approach with bleeding Hearts And faultering Tongues, but Orders from the Kingâ Gondibert. Tibalt, speak out, what Orders from my Sov'reign? Tibalt. Forgive Us, noble Sir, the King commands That we confine you till his farther Pleasure. Gondibert. I know Submission, as I knew to conquer. I fought his Battles, and He thus rewards me. But be it so; for Kings must be obey'd. The delegated Majesty of Heav'n, The radiant Image which improv'd Creation Is stamp'd upon Them, and their Laws enforces With sacred Characters. The Deity Lets down Himself into the Rays of Kings, And throws a reverential Glory round Them Inviolable, as a Guard celestial And Panoply divine. I know my Duty. Ev'n tho' They errâAnd Man is prone to Errors; Altho' protected with that high Commission, His Passions may betray Him or his Weaknessâ Yet still we must forget Him as a Man, Confess the Tye betwixt the Gods and Him, Like Jupiter's betwixt his Throne and Earth, And glory, while we suffer, in Obedience. âI follow Youâlead on.âAlas, my Birtha, Thy Sorrows, not the royal Menace, wound me; No sooner Heav'n bestow'd its choicest Blessing, In giving Thee, butâ Birtha. Oh, my Heart, my Heart! The Pangs of Seperation are upon Thee. And is our Love thus blasted in its Spring, Now, when the Buds of Hope were sweetly-swelling And promising a bounteous Crop of Joy? Enter Messinger. Messinger. Your Stay is dangerous: This Moment part Them, Or Punishment awaits your Disobedience, The Princess self commanded me to tell you, And threaten'd Vengeance in her Words and Eyes. Gondibert. The Princessâha!âThe King may be impos'd on; Perhaps his Tenderness for Rhodolinda, Perhaps the sudden Transport of his Passion Inflam'd with her pernicious Rage might drive Him Impetuous on, which Reason yet may cool; Perhapsâwe still may Hopeâ [Aside. Tibalt. It grieves us, Sir, But pardon usâour Lives are else in Dangerâ Birtha. Nought but the cruel Hand of Death shall part us. No:âI will be Companion of your Woes, Your faithful dear associate in Confinement, Try every gentle Art and winning Charm, To woo you from Affliction and beguile Approaching Pangs from hatching in your Bosom. I'll teach your Chains to sit more easy on you, And by the powerful Chemistry of Love Their Iron soften or convert to Gold. When the raw Dungeon-Damps pollute your Senses, I'll breath a warm and fragrant Gale of Sighs, To sweeten Misery; my Breast, your Pillow, Shall heave you to repose, my faithful Arms, A kinder Prison, fold you into Rest, And my Lips chastly kiss away your Sorrows. Gondibert. The Gods will bless Thee, Birtha, and protect Thee, And for thy Sake may kindly look on Me. Enter another Messinger. Tibalt. My Lord! Gondibert. 'Tis well: one dear Embrace, my Birtha. The Rest I leave to Heav'n; for Heav'n is just. Adieuâbe comfortedâwe must obeyâ Adieu! 1. Guard. We little thought to lead our General To Prison thusâ 2. Guard. But if the Camp shou'd hear it, He's so deservedly belov'd, They'd Allâ Tibalt. What are you muttering there?âSir, We attend you. [Exeunt. SCENE III. BIRTHA, THULA, ASTRAGON. Birtha. Are these the Comforts of a Bridal-Day? The Sighs of Ecstasy are sunk in Sobs Of Bitterness. A Prison deep, and dreary As the dark Mansions of the Dead, receive Him, Receive my Lord and Husband! Oh, my Heart, What Hoards of Rapture didst thou fondly promise, What golden Scenes, what Flows of endless Joys, What Calms of Fortune, and what Smiles of Love! Instead of these, O Heav'ns, instead of Blessings, The baleful Stars have pour'd their Curses on me And empty'd all the Vials of their Wrath. But why on me, ye Stars, but why on me? How have my tender Years provok'd your Rage, And what has been my Crime? for sure, o sure It is no Crime to love as I have lov'd, So chastly, tenderly as I have lov'd! Then why these Plagues on me? If Love be Guilt, Who, who is innocent? Enter Astragon. [Astragon.] What lovely Mourner, What Daughter of Affliction wounds my Ear With such sad Accents? ahâit is my own, My poor, dear Birtha, 'tis my only Child! What ails my Love? what Misery unheard of Provokes this deep and overflowing Sorrow? Say, tell me; that thy Father with the Wing Of Tenderness may guard Thee from thy Sorrows. Birtha. No, rather curse me; for my Woes are such So black with Fate, that not a pitying Pow'r Dare spread one Ray of Comfort on my Soul Or lift me kindly into Joy again. Despair has drag'd me down into her Cave, And chain'd me there for everâO my Father! Astragon. What? shall I curse my Child? no, Birtha, no: May the best Wishes of a dying Mother Pour'd for her Infants, weeping round her Bed In all the Agonies of artless Sorrow, Encompass thee about with dearest Blessings. But say what sudden Stroke of Fate has sunk Thee So very low, that Hope has left my Child, That Hope, the last of Friends, has left my Birtha? Birtha. Oh!âdo not break, my Heart, before my Tongue Has told the Tale of Misery; but then In a long Sob dissolve my Life away. But do not break before my Father know The Pangs I feel, and their most dismal Causes That he may pity me: and sure He will, For he has ever been the best of Fathers, Most loving and belov'd! and see, He weeps, Poor, good Old-man He weeps before He knows them, What must He then, what must He when He hears? What Heart-felt Stings, what bleeding Drops of Nature! âBut I will spare his Peace: Why shou'd I wound Him, Why drink the Fountain of my Life, and lay His venerable Greyness in the Dust? Astragon. Yet tell me, tho' thy every Accent blast me, And shrivel up my Being like a Scroll. Tell me, for I am on the Rack? what said I? The Rack is softer Ease than Beds of Roses. Uncertainty is Death, is more, is Hellâ Birtha. First, I am marry'd, there, O there I fallâ Astragon. Marry'd? I hope to Gondibert. Birtha. To Gondibert. Astragon. And can thy Marriage with that Noble Youth, And gentlest of his Sex too, give This Pain. Birtha. O that undoes me! 'tis the Pang of Pangs, To think the dear, the tender, gentle Youth, Just when the Holy Priest had made us One, Just when He breath'd the fondest Vows of Love That ever fill'd a Virgin's Ear with Rapture, And sigh'd, and smil'd unutterable Softness, That He shou'd then be ravish'd from my Arms, That then the Bolt of Fate shou'd hurl Him from me, Shou'd hurl Him thus for everâ'tis too muchâ I sinkâI hope the Hand of Death is on me. My Father, Oh my Father!â Falls into his Arms. Astragon. O my Child!â Run, Thula, fetch the Life-restoring Drops, The Aromatick Stream of Herbs and Flow'rs By Chimick Forces drawn to stay the Soul Just fleeting to the Stars, and call it back To animate again the pallid Clay.â Awake, my Birtha! O my Child! my Child. Why wilt thou leave thy Aged Father thus To Pain, to Grief, to Wretchedness for ever? Thou only Comfort of my Eyes, awake, Prop of my Life, and Glory of my Age, Thou dear, dear Image of thy Mother's Sweetness, Awake, and bless thy Father with thy Beauties, Gild his Grey Hairs with thy returning Beams, And do not leave me on the Verge of Age! For who shall close my Eyes, when thou art gone? Who pay the last sad Duties at my Grave? Who pour the Stream of Sorrow on my Herse, Or sooth my hovering Spirit like to Birtha? She revives. Birtha. OâohâWhy am I curst to Life again. And does the Grave too envy me its Darkness, Nor will it kindly gape and take me in? My Father! am I in your Arms again? I hop'd e're this that Life had left its Mansion, Nor wou'd have staid with one so curst as I am. O how I long to mingle with the Dust, To mingle with my Mother's cold, cold Ashes And warm Them to receive and blend with Yours. O Death, Death, Death, borrow the Wings of Time For now thou art too slow. Thula. Break, break, my Heart!â Astragon. Forbear to talk thus.âYet I hope that Heav'n Will smile in favourable Blessings on us. Come, my dear Birtha, Thula shall inform me Of thy Misfortunes, and I'll strive to aid Thee With all a Father's Care, and Mother's Fondness. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Enter Aribert. Guards at a Distance. Aribert. My Daughter's Passion hurry'd me too far: Now cooler Reason mounts again her Throne, I blame myself. True, Gondibert's Refusal Might well alarm a Woman in her Weakness: Besides, my Hopes are cross'd: my every Wish Was center'd in Him for my Son and Heir: By Blood ally'd, I fix'd on Him alone. His Virtues might have dignify'd a scepter, And added fresher Honours to my Kingdom. My Kingdom's Wish no less than mine.âHow blind Are Mortals to Futurity? One Glance From Beauty's Eye can baffle all our Schemes And melt them down to Air. This fatal Marriage, Thus unforseen, has overturn'd the Plan Of many a wakeful Hour.âBut be it so: From different Courts I still have Choice of Sons, Who plead their Passion for my Daughter's Love, With richer Crowns than mine and fairer Kingdoms. âSince Gondibert is marry'd, let me pay Him The proper Honours which his Merit claims, His Father's Goodness and his own demand it. He still shall be my General and my Friend! The Message which I sent was too severe, Forbidding Him my Presence: I revoke it. I know the Powers of Beauty and forgive Him. I long to comfort his afflicted Youth And hail the Bridegroom with the Voice of Joy, Of prosperous Wishes and unfeigned Pardon. To the Guards. Go find the noble Gondibert and tell Him To meet me in the Gardens: I'll be there. SCENE V. Enter Astragon and Birtha. Astragon. Forgive us, Royal Sir, forgive your Servantsâ Birtha. Forgive your humble suppliant who implores Your Pardon to my Lord, tho' not to me. Here let your Indignation sate its Fury Upon my wretched Head: I'll dye with Pleasure To satisfy the Justice of your Anger: But spare my Gondibert, O spare my Husband, For Mercy's Sake for Piety's forgive Him; By these fast-streaming TearsâO let Them speak The bleeding Anguish of my wounded Spirit, And steal the Drops of Pity to your Bosom!â King. Speak, Astragon, what means this beauteous Vision, This Daughter of the Skies (the Skies may claim Her) Bright as the Morning Star, yet wet with Dews, Thus kneeling at my Feet? Arise:âmy Senses Are dazzled at her Radiance.âEase my Wonder. Astragon. My Daughter in the Feelingness of Sorrow, And from a Heart in Pieces torn with Grief, For her imprison'd Husband begs Compassion. Upon my aged Knees I likewise beg it: If e're my salutary Skill in Med'cin, If e're my faithful Lessons of Instruction Reliev'd your Body or compos'd your Mind When agoniz'd with Doubts or stung with Pain; If e'er my daily and my nightly Pray'rs, Sent from the Fullness of my Heart to Heav'n For Blessings on you, drew those Blessings down, Have pity on her Youth, forgive the Duke, And save us from the Terrors of your Wrath! King. Rise, Both.âThy Daughter's Beauty might prevail O'er Jupiter, offended at Mankind, To lay his Thunder by.âAs sure as Venus, Like Thee distress'd and beautiful like Thee, Shining in Tears and breathing of Ambrosia, Obtain'd of Jove to pity her Ãneas Our glorious Ancestor, from whom we sprung, So sure I pardon Gondibert and Thee. His Choice of Thee absolves Him from all Guilt, Thou Something more than Mortal! and exalts Him Above the Thrones and Happiness of Kings. SCENE VI. Enter Tibalt. Tibalt. The Soldiers, Sir, in mutinous Disorder, Allegiance broken, in a civil Storm Led on by Ulfinore, with hideous Clamours Rush from the Camp, and threaten Desolation, Unless the Duke be quickly freed from Prison. King. From Prison freed! hah!âWho imprison'd Gondibert? Thy Words confound meâspeakâor else Thou dy'st. Tibalt. By your Commands, for so the Princess told us, Sir, we imprison'd Him this Morn. King. Confusion!â By my Commands?âthe Princess told you so?â Destruction on his Head who durst attempt it. âThis is a Plot of Hers: unhappy Woman! âI'll teach her more Obedience.âBy the Gods She, She Herself shall wait upon their Nuptials. Go tell Her so; and say that I command Her. âMy General the Protector of my Country To be imprison'd for a Woman's Humourâ 'Twas wrongâ'twas baseâShe may repent her Rashness. âYou, Astragon, meanwhile appease the Soldiers, While I myself release my injur'd Heroe, And satisfy his Doubts. Birtha. O hear your Handmaid, Most gracious Sir, and grant me this Request, Commit the grateful Message to my Care: Forgive my eager Fondness to convey Myself your Royal Mercy to my Lord, And Both will wait upon You with our Duty. King. Here, take this Signet: tell Him how I long To make Amends for this unheard of Usage. May Comfort guide thy Steps. Birtha. Upon your Head May Blessings fall in neverceasing Show'rs, Thick as the Winter Stars or Summer Flow'rs! May future Lovers bless your Sacred Name, And future Poets consecrate your Fame. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. a Prison. Enter Birtha. Birtha. A sweet Sensation melting round my Heart Springs up and overflows my Soul with Joy, Which conjugal Affection only feels; A secret Glow and Throbbing to impart The dear Assurance of our mutual Safety. I'll steal upon his Sorrows like a Slumber Pregnant with Bliss to sooth a Fever's Rage Tumultuous charging thro' the languid Patient, After long Tossings on the Bed of Sickness; The balmy Comfort sinks into his Senses And sweetly cools the Life-consuming Flame. This Passport to my Love, this precious Signet Throws out a Ray of Glory o'er the Gloom Which Melancholy hangs around the Dungeon, And lights me to his Presence. Hark, methought I heard his Voice; be still, my Tongue, a Moment, One Moment let me listen to his Moanings, Then pour the Tidings of Delight at once Into his Soul, and give Him all my Raptures. [Retires aside. Enter Gondibert. Gondibert. Yesâtho' besieg'd with Guards, and fenc'd with Walls, The Soul is left at Liberty to wing Her free Excursions and disdains Confinement. Confinement may be dreadful to the Wicked: When Conscience whets her Stings and Darkness frowns Brooding with supernumerary Horrors, Woe to the guilty Spirit! Guilt may tremble When self-condemn'd, and call on deeper Night To cover from the Wrath of Heav'n offended Its Coward, shrinking Head,âand call in vain. But strong in Innocence why shou'd I fear? True to my Honour, faithful to my Sov'reign, Can I deserve his Rage? if not deserve it, His Rage is impotent. The Gods protect Their pious Votaries where're They find them, In Prisons or in Palaces, the same Unerring Arbitrators of our Fortunes, Supremely good and merciful in Justice. Tho' Malice send her Flight of Arrows at me If Virtue spread her Adamantine Shield, From Heav'ns bright Armory, of sevenfold Proof, They pointless fall, and innocent of Harm, Their idle Forces spent in empty Air, Like spoils in Battle, but adorn my Conquest. âBut BirthaâBirthaâO the dear Forlorn One! Her tender Sorrows, pressing on my Heart, Unman my firmest Purposeâput to flight The Succours which Philosophy wou'd lend me. Were she but safe!âmy Soul wou'd be at Peace. [Birtha comes forward. Birtha. Behold Her here, and safe, and thine for ever. The King forgives us Bothâ Gondibert. Forgives us? Birtha. Yes: Our Happiness begins its golden Round, And we shall never Taste of Anguish more. Gondibert. Thy Words transport me with Delight and Wonder, Too full of overbearing Joy to gain Credit from any but from Thee. Birtha. Behold The Royal Signet as the Seal of Pardon. Gondibert. And is it given me once again to hear Thee, To bless my Eyes with thy endearing Beauties And strain Thee to my Breast?âO bounteous Heav'n! O gracious Aribert! O happy Gondibert! This Moment might reward an Age of Bondage. O Birtha, O my Wife! my Joy, my Blessing, Thou Object of my Soul! O take me thus, Thus folded in thy Arms in circling Bliss, And may we never, never part again. Still let me clasp Thee to my glowing Heart, Which beats against my Bosom to receive Thee. Birtha. My Heart expands Itself to let Thee in And wrap thy Image in the Foldings there, Deep in the warm Recesses of my Being! There I will cherish my dear Lord for ever. Enter Astragon. Astragon. Joy to you Both! A Father's Blessing on You. âThe Soldiers are appeas'd, The King forgives Them, And sends me to declare his generous Will, And call you to the Banquet, now preparing In Honour of your Marriage. Enter Messinger. Messinger. Hail to Birtha! The Princess in regard to Birtha's Worth Forgets all former Jealousies and Wrongs, And sends her Joy and Peace. She waits to see You. Birtha. We humbly will attend the King and Princess Much honour'd with her Grace. [Exit Messinger. Gondibert. This sudden Changeâ I like it not, beware of Rhodolinda. [To Birtha aside. What of the Soldiers? for I think you nam'd Them. Enter Ulfinore. Ulfinore. Eternal Happiness attend my Lord, And crown his beauteous Bride and Him with Joy. Gondibert. I know thy honest Nature. Birtha. Sir, We thank You. Astragon. The Soldiers, Sir,âbut Ulfinore Himself Will tell You at a more convenient Season, And give the full Relation. We, mean time, Prepare ourselves to wait upon the King, And taste the Blessings which the Gods bestow. Gondibert. To Them give all the Praise. My Birtha looks So near ally'd to Heav'n, Her Voice and Hands Will recommend our Incence and our Vows. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter Rhodolinda, Laura. Rhodolinda. Thou tell'st me Wonders. Laura. Greater wait behind. Soon as I reach'd the sage Urganda's Cell, A Flight of Owls and Batts and Raven-Wings With hideous Clang, I tremble to relate it, Beat the thick Air, and Adders thro' the Brakes Hiss'd rusling, grumbled underneath the Ground, And open wide the Doors, harsh-creaking, flew. I shou'd have dy'd with Fear, if Zeal to serve You, My royal Mistress, had not arm'd my Soul, Weak in its native female Pow'rs, with Courage Unknown before, against these Scenes of Horror. She, tottering o'er an Ebon Staff, demanded My Business at that solemn Hour of Darkness. Quick I acquainted Her with your Commission, With trembling haste: She mutter'd and withdrew, But soon return'd, and folded in a Paper She gave the Poison You requir'd. âTake this, This Powder, tell thy Mistress, breaths Destruction, Perfum'd with Death: no Skill on Earth can save The Person who but smells the precious Bane. These Herbs were gather'd by the trembling Moon-light, Beneath a Mandrakes melancholy Shade, Steep'd in Echidna's Gore and wash'd in Acheron; Thrice with the sooty Wings of East-winds fann'd, And thrice unhallow'd with a Blight of Curses In Demogorgon's Hall: the Charm is fatal.â She said, and with an hollow Smile retir'd. Rhodolinda. What Dangers hast Thou undergone to ease me? Nor shall They, unrewarded, pass forgotten. Now to our Business. We in Time provided This blessed Remedy: had we defer'd A Day, an Hour, a Moment, as you find, It wou'd have come too late; at least for Vengeance. She shall not live an Hour. The King commands My Presence at this hated Nuptial Banquet, The Bride shall find me there, and Death together. Yes, Death shall hold her Revels, and Destruction Drest up in Smiles and Flow'rs. Methinks I see Her Flushing with Pride, perhaps with Scorn:âenjoy Thy momentary Triumph;âyes,âenjoy Thy Husband's Vowsâanother Moment longerâ Then, then the Triumph shall be all my own. Are all Things ready? Laura. All prepar'd by Tibalt; The Flow'rs, the Sword the Cupids and the Music. Rhodolinda. 'Tis well. Meanwhile, Dissimulation, aid me, Ingenious in thy undermining Artsâ Yet timerousâO that we must sink so low!â My Soul disdains Thee, but Revenge commands me, So thou, Dissimulation prompt my Purpose, Thou trick my Countenance with lying Smiles, And breath thy subtle Pow'rs into my Eyes. âTh'Hyena and Revenge may soon be tutour'd; For Nature, ready Nature points the Way. Enter Servant. Servant. Madam, the Banquet waits You. Rhodolinda. I'll be there. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Enter Ulfinore. Ulfinore. Perdition on his Head! the lurking Villainâ 'Twas He that drew this Danger on my Lord, 'Twas He acquainted Laura with his Love, Against th'inviolable Laws of Friendship, 'Twas He declar'd me Traytor to the King: O wou'd some God but give Him to this Arm, A Victim to the Fury of my Vengeance, With fell Delight I'd riot in his Blood, And every Blow shou'd right my wounded Honour. Enter Two dress'd like Cupids, They cross the Stage, the One with a Sword the Other with a Garland. What fair Delusion swims before my Eyes? Speak, say what are You? for what Purpose? ha! My Senses fail'd me.âAre the Gods descended To grace my Master's Nuptials with their Presence? It was the Error of my Understanding: The Vision is dissolv'd and sunk in Air. Was it to interrupt Revenge? it shall not: Tho' Erebus shou'd pour out all its Forms And griefly Shapes of Horror, I will on, And find the Villain Tibalt.âHence, vain Shadows, Nor dare to disengage my settled Soul From her sure Purpose.âLead me on, Revenge, I follow thy red Footsteps to the Grave. [Exit Ulfinore. SCENE IV. Enter Tibalt. [Tibalt.] Where shall I hide my ignominious Head? I hate the Light, and cannot bear myself. âCurse on the Weakness which betray'd my Virtue. How am I fall'n from Honour! O my Soulâ And how become the Instrument of Hell, To murder Innocence which never wrong'd me! âDrawn by a Woman to forego my Faith To worthy Ulfinoreâto mingle Poison Ev'n for my General's Bride!âRejoice, Prometheus; Thy Vulture will be mine; my Guilt is blacker: Thy Crime was only stealing Heav'nly Fire, Which mine extinguishes, in murd'ring Birtha, Form'd of Celestial Beams!âEarth groans beneath me: Hell, Hell, I feel Thee Here.âHa, Ulfinore? I'd rather meet Alecto with her Whips, Than my offended Friend.âGape, Earth, and hide me. [Exit. Enter Ulfinore. Ulfinore. 'Twas He, the Wretch!âNow aid me, Heav'n and Justice! Far as the flaming Limits of the World I'll follow Thee, or punish thy Transgression,â The Center shall not hide thee from my Arm, While Vengeance whets my Sword and Justice guides it. [Exit. SCENE V. KING, RHODOLINDA, GONDIBERT, BIRTHA, ASTRAGON, PHILOSOPHERS &amp;c. as after the Banquet. Gondibert. This royal Overflowing of your Bounty Restrains my fault'ring Tongue, which fain wou'd speak The thankful Language of my grateful Heart.â My Actions shall declare my Zeal and Duty. King. Dear to my Soul as when, adorn'd with Spoils, Thou bravely triumph'd o'er my Kingdoms Foes, Establishing my Throne, I reinstate Thee My General and my Friend: forget the Storm Which burst too sudden, but is pass'd away Ne'er to distress Thee more. Exert again Thy pristine Pow'rs and shine with equal Glory. The generous Eagle thus, awhile dismiss'd The Service of the Cloud-compelling God, In Darkness drooping, flags his burnish'd Wings, Nor bears his bold Incursions on the Sun; But soon recall'd He tow'ring claps his Pinions Resumes the Bolt of Jove and grasps the Thunder. Here, crown and reach the Bowl; let purple Bacchus Walk jocund round.âHe sparkles in the Gold With reconciling Smiles, and courts the Lip Ambitious of the charming Health we give. Joy to the Bride. Rhodolinda. And to the Bridegroom Health. Birtha. The Business of my Life, most gracious Princess, Shall be employ'd in praising of your Goodness. 1. Philosopher. May Heav'n surround you with the Gifts of Plentyâ 2. Philosopher. With Peace and Pleasureâ 3. Philosopher. And a beauteous Offspring Rich in their Father's and their Mother's Gracesâ Astragon. May every Day like this be crown'd with Blessings, Till ripe for Immortality you gather The glorious Harvest and Reward of Virtue, Partakers of celestial, endless Joys. King. But where's the Musick? Harmony becomes This genial HourâHere, let the sprightly Viol The numerous Lyre and soft melodious Lute, With every Instrument of pleasant String Divide their Notes and wake the Sounds of Rapture. Enter two Pages drest like Cupids. 1. Sings and presents a Naked Sword richly embelish'd with Diamonds to Gondibert. By the brazen Pomp of War, By the glittering of his Spear, Mars commands his favourite Son With this Sword to grace his Side, To protect with this his Bride And his Royal Master's Throne. Mark its Beams! How it gleams! Not Ãneas' brighter shone: Fit to guard a Bride and Throne. 2. With a Garland sings. By the Billing of her Doves, By the Arrows of her Loves Venus from her Paphian Bow'rs, Begs the Bride, the beauteous Bride (Let not Venus be deny'd) To accept this Wreath of Flow'rs; Roses glowing, Myrtle blowing, All their Sweets and Charms are Yours: O accept this Wreath of Flow'rs. As He is presenting the Crown of Flow'rs to Birtha enter Ulfinore wounded. Ulfinore. Perish thy hellish Present, smiling Villainâ [Catches It and stamps it under his Feet. King. Unmanner'd Slave! what means this bold Intrusion? Gondibert. Ah! bleeding? Ulfinore, explain thyselfâ He faintsâHe fallsâ Ulfinore. Forgive my seeming Rudeness, This Rudeness which preserves the Life of Birtha. Gondibert. Ha! sayst Thouâ Ulfinore. Hold, my Life, till I have told The guilty Tale, and I shall dye in Peace.â This Moment Tibalt, whom my Arm has slain For Treachery to Friendship and my Master, Expiring and repenting of his Treason, Confess'd, in Combination with his Wife And Rhodolinda, that He strew'd these Flow'rs With baleful Aconite and Drugs from Hell, With Charms deliver'd by the Witch Urganda, To poison Birtha.âLuckily I came Fast as my Wounds allow'd me and prevented Her certain Fate:âFor which I thank the Gods And gladly fall a Victimâat her Feet. [Dies. Rhodolinda. Ye cruel Stars!âwhatâam I disappointed? Thus I make sureâ [Snatches the Sword and offers to stab Birtha: prevented by Gondibert. Baffled again!âConfusionâ Then thusâ [Stabs Herself. King. Oh Horror, O!âmy Crown to save Herâ [Faints. Gondibert. Good Heav'n, support the King! Rhodolinda. The Stroke was Homeâ My Life-blood follows, and my flaming Spirits With Indignation quit their hated Mansions. And yet, my Soul! but oh it is too lateâ The Rage of Female Pride contemn'd and scorn'd To Madness drove meâhurl'd me on Destruction. O Rhodolinda! by thyself undoneâ Revenge in Woman, kindled by Despair Must end inâDeath.âO cursed Pride and Jealousy, O fatal Female RuinâPride and Jealousy Absolve the Furiesâwhen compar'd with Them The Furies seem to whiten into Virtue. âMy Hate together with my Life is finish'd.â Forgive me, Birtha, Gondibert, forgive me, And pardon Laura tooâthe Guilt was mine. âThe Crown must now be Yoursâlet that attone For all the Crimes my frantick Passion plottedâ Gondibert. Madam your last Request shall be obey'd; We pardon LauraâFor the Witch Urganda Flames, next that Hell she's leagu'd with, shall await her. Rhodolinda. âMy Father!âO take care of his Old Ageâ His Grief sits heavy on his Spiritsâoh. [Dies. Astragon. The King revives; quick, softly lead Him hence, And I'll attend Him with my ablest Care. Gondibert. All-gracious Heav'n! Thy Mercy first be prais'd: Repair We to the Temple! Then we'll pay Our Duty to the DeadâMy Birtha, come, Sav'd by the Gods and their protecting Goodness, To crown my Life with Joy! Astragon. From hence behold The righteous Care of PROVIDENCE, who guards With its bright Shield, and leads thro' secret Paths The Innocent to Peace: While Guilt is punish'd By its own wicked Arts, and vile Revenge Pursues her Votaries with Swords and Poisons, But chief Blood-Guiltiness. Murthers intended, Tho', by Heav'ns Care, not put in Execution, For ever to their Authors fatal prove, While Happiness attends on Virtuous Love. [Exeunt Omnes. FINIS.</field>
