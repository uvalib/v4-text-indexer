      <field name="fulltext">THE Unhappy Penitent A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable CHARLES Lord HALLIFAX. My Lord, Since I first ventur'd into the World to stand the Test of Publick Censure, I have ever had in my aim as the highest Point of Ambition, to produce something worthy of your Lordships approbation, without which I esteem'd the Suffrages of the People, as the Votes of our Representatives, of no force till the Royal Assent Stamps them into a Law, which after none dare contradict: But conscious how far short of that Merit I have hitherto fall'n, and yet impatient to offer my intended Homage, I thus address you not as the Sovereign Judge of perfection, but as the Patron and Encourager or all who aspire to it, the no less God-like, tho' less awful Character; which how eminently your Lordships, the many who Flourish under your auspicious Influence are a prooff; for if we allow a Congreve to owe your Favour to your Strictest Justice, there are not Numbers who cou'd find their Safety but with me, in appealing to your Goodness; tho' I am apt to think more of our Poets wou'd arrive at perfection, if they observ'd their peculiar Talent, and confin'd themselves to it. The most Universal Genius this Nation ever bred, Dryden himself did not excel in every part, through most of what he has writ there appears a distinguishing greatness, that Elevation of Thought, that Sublime which transports the Soul; he commands our Admiration of himself, but little moves our concern for those he represents; his Genius seems not turn'd to work upon the softer Passions, tho' some of his last Translations are excellent in that kind, nothing more lively, more tender, or more moving, but there the Words, alone are his, of which it must be confess'd he had on all Subjects the exactest Propriety, the most Expressive, and dispos'd into the sweetest Numbers. Otway besides his Judicious Choice of the Fable, had a peculiar Art to move Compassion, which as it is one of the chief Ends of Tragedy, he found most adapted to his Genius, and never venturing where that did not lead him, excell'd in the Pathetick. Had Lee consulted his strength as well, he might have giv'n us more perfect Pieces, but aiming at the sublime, instead of being Great he is extravagant; his Stile too swelling, and if we pursue him in his flights, he often carries us out of Nature: Had he restrain'd that vain Ambition, and intirely apply'd himself to describe the softest of the Passions, (for Love of all the rest he seems best to have understood, if that be allow'd a proper subject for Tragedy) he had certainly had fewer defects. The inimitable Shakespear seems alone secure on every side from an attack, (for I speak not here of Faults against the Rules of Poetry, but against the natural Genius) he had all the Images of nature present to him, Study'd her throughly, and boldly copy'd all her various Features, for tho' he has chiefly exerted himself on the more Masculine Passions, 'tis as the choice of his Judgment not the restraint of his Genius, and he seems to have design'd those few tender moving Scenes he has giv'n us, as a prooff he cou'd be every way equally Admirable. I know not how, my Lord, in designing only to hint an Obstacle to perfection in our Poets, I have unawares launch'd into a subject which I fear your Lordship will think unbecoming me to touch; but if Presidents may be admitted as a Plea, several wretched Poets before me have had the priviledge of passing their Censure on the best; however I may be allow'd to urge that the Fault which I have caution'd against, is not mine, I know too well the Bounds of my stinted Talent, and I fear may rather be accused of not having exerted the little strength I have, than of aiming beyond it in this weak Performance, which I presume not to offer your Lordship but as an object of your mercy; and like some City Ladies who are content to be the jest at Court rather than not appear there, I feel a Satisfaction in the Honour of being known to your Lordship, tho' only by my Faults. The knowledge of our Transgressions may be a considerable Step towards amending them for the future, but 'tis certainly a great aggravation of them in the Committing, which I must confess my self guilty of in Writing this Play, being sensible before I began it of a defect in the Plot, the only one I shall mention as the foundation of all the rest; the Distress is not great enough, the Subject of it only the misfortune of Lovers, which I partly design'd in Compliance with the effiminate taste of the Age; notwithstanding which, and the right of Possession, it has long held on the Modern Stage, I have ventur'd to propose a Doubt whether Love be a proper Subject for it; seems to me not Noble, not solemn enough for Tragedy, but I have a much greater Objection against it, at least as 'tis generally represented, which the best of the French Peets has made before me, and gives as a Rule, Boileau in his Art Poetique. ? que Lamour Souvent de remors combattu Pariosse une foiblesse, &amp; non une vertu. The most that can be allow'd that Passion is to be the Noblest frailty of the Mind, but 'tis a Frailty, and becomes a Vice, when cherish'd as an exalted Vertue: A Passion which contracts the Mind, by fixing it intirely on one object, and sets all our happiness at Stake on so great hazard as the caprice, or fidelity of another, which if there were no greater is sure sufficient reason, not to Arm it with more Power than its own insinuating Nature; yet this is made the shining Vertue of our Heroes we are to rejoice in their success, or pitty their Disappointments, as Noble Lovers, Patterns for our imitation, not as Instances of humane Frailty, and I fear this has not been so constantly done without ill consequence; not but Love will maintain his Dominion in the World how muchsoever oppos'd, but if we resign him the heart, let us not give him up the Judgment too. On these Reflections I compos'd this Tragedy, in which the principal Characters are indeed doting Lovers, but hurry'd by their Passion into a Fault of which their immediate punishment makes them conscious, and at once deserve their Sufferings and our Pitty. This (I cannot forbear taking notice by the way) tho' giv'n by our great Master as an inviolabe Law in this sort of Poem, is yet observ'd by few without which tho' they may give Delight, they can rarely attain that End to which the other shou'd only be Subservient of forming an Instructive Moral. What can I say, my Lord, in excuse for intruding my Remarks before so exact a Judge, when that which is my only motive to it makes it a Presumption, the Authority of your Lordships Judgment, for were it less I cou'd not have my End; If the Drammatick rules were justly observ'd, the Stage would soon retreive that Credit which the abuses of it has I fear with too great reason lost, and be again a useful Entertainment; which as I very much wish, I know not a Surer means to effect, than by proposing the method our Poets have taken, to your Lordships decisive Sentence, which wou'd have more force than all the severest Harangnes of the Pulpit; we are apt to Suspect Men of a particular Proffession, of over Zeal, or Ostentation in their Office, or prejudice again the Art whose Proffessors they expose; but when a known disinterested and judicious Friend condemns us, we confess his Justice, and correct our selves; who wou'd appeal from your Lordship, who are not only allow'd the most excellent Judge, but the most Generous Patron of the Sacred Art; and to reform the Abuses of it is an Employment not unworthy your high Station, or to be mingled with the most weighty Business of the Publick; when the great Cardinal Richlieu was laying the Foundation of a glorious Monarchy, the Establishment and Reformation of the Theatre was not thought below his care; and the wisest Common-wealths provided for the diversion of the People; if that were a State Policy, 'tis sure a Divine one to contrive that their very Pleasures be made their Instruction; and I cannot apprehend the trouble, or the difficulty, will more discourage your Lordship in what concerns our Morals, than our Interest, for which we saw you so resolutely carry on that great work of Recoining our Money, at such an Exigence as made it seem no less impossible, than it was necessary in the heat of an expensive War, when the weighty Taxes had already almost exhausted the People's patience, who seldom thinking beyond what they feel, murmur at suffering a present Inconvenience, to prevent their future ruin; yet obstinately good, you wou'd secure their interest against their Wills, and have now the satisfaction to hear them bless you for the benefit they enjoy, and admire that Prudence and Resolution they owe it to, with which your Lordship Stem'd the many difficulties that oppos'd you: This is that publick Spirit which makes the most shining Character of the greatest Men, and which no doubt will always animate your Lordship to the confusion of your calumniating Enemies, whilst they see you live as Plato said he wou'd in such a case, So that no body should believe them; a Noble revenge, at once their Reproach and Happiness! yes, my Lord, methinks I know you destin'd a publick Blessing, nor need that Inspiration Poets pretend to, for the Prophecy of what your firmness of mind, your prudence and beneficient Nature no less assure, than the opportunities of your Station require: But how blest are those who, by a nearer dependance on your Lordship, contract your diffusive Vertues, and feel all their force when exerted on particular Objects, who have found in you the best of Masters, the most affable and agreeable Companion, the most Admirable Husband, and the truest most entire Friend. But I am running into that Fault I have proffess'd to avoid, of aiming beyond my Talent, the Reflection how far my Noble Theme is above me, scarce can check the Transport it has rais'd, but my respect prevails, I resign it to those Sacred Pens, whose lasting Works will secure so great a Character that immortality it merits; but tho' I cannot pretend to that glorious priviledge of Poets, to commit my Patrons Name to future Ages, permit me the humbler Ambition of securing my self under your Lordships protection from the Injuries of this, which I aspire to not only as my greatest safety, but as the highest Honour to be own'd, My Lord, Your Lordship's most respectful humble Servant Catherine Trotter.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE Spoken by Mrs. Oldfeild. Of late we've heard of nothing but of War, The Cry is young Gustavus, and the Czar: How to Finall the Gallick Squadrons fly; What Schemes are form'd against our old Ally, But now the peaceful Tattle of the Town, Is how to join both Houses into one, And whilst the blustering hot-brain'd Heroes fight, Our softer Sex pleads gently to unite. No Wounds but Cupid's discompose our Mind. And if we're cruel, 'tis when we are kind. Our calm Complectiin Love's soft Mansion seeks, We swoon at Blood, unless 'tis in our Cheeks, Hence you've to Night a Bloodless Tragedy, Our Authoress cannot let her Heroe dye. 'Tis not an Age to drown, tho' burn for Love, Will nought but Death your barbarous pitty move! Here's what is worse to one that's well enclin'd, The desperate Nymph renounces all Mankind.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Excellent Mrs. Catherine Trotter As when Aurora's graceful Blushes chear, With gentle beams, the glimering Hemisphere, Faint are her glances, and her feeble fire, Compels no saucy Critick to retire; Her week efforts small Victory can boast, And her slight Charms but warm us at the most. Thus like the Morning Star Orinda rose Mrs. Phillips. A Champion for her Sex, and wisely chose, Conscious of Female weakness, humble wais T'insinuate for applause, not storm the Bays. Next gay Astrea briskly won the Prize, Mrs. Behn. Yet left a spacious room to Criticise. But when bright Phæbus gilds the Orb around, And from Olympus strikes the distant ground, With rays of glory, whose refulgent light, Dazle the shallow Opticks of our sight, By the strong force of excellence alone The mighty Deity erects his Throne, And by sublimer faculties is known. Like him bright Maid thy great Perfections shine, As awful, as resplendent, as divine; Like him thy Soul in its Cælestial frame, Darts forth as pure, as vigorous a flame; And in the full Meridian you sit, With Sov'raign pow'r of Beauty, and of Wit; And as the dimmer Tapers of the Skies, Vail when the more transcendent God does rise, So those precedent Lamps withdrew their light Timely to do thy wond'rous Genius right. Mirtle and Bays about thy Temples twine, Plac'd by Apollo, and the Sacred Nine, And ev'ry Grace, and ev'ry vertue's thine. By thy judicious Rules the Hero learns To vanquish Fate, and weild his Conq'ring Arms, The bashful Virgin to defend her heart, The prudent Wife to scorn dishonest Art, The Friend sincerity; temp'rance the Youth, The Lover Chastity, and Statesman Truth. Within thy bosom all these Treasures dwell, Nor can we judge in which you most excell. So perfect even Envy you controul Minerva and Diana guard your Soul. Sarah Pierse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene. The King's Antichamber. Enter Brisson and Du Croy. Brisson. 'Twas politickly done, I must admire Madam of Bourbon's Art; well might she fear Her power with the King, alone too weak For Margarite's Charms, whose Presence may revive That Love which Absence help'd her to destroy. Du Croy. 'Twas therefore doubtless, she so press'd our Duke To bring the Princess Ann, his Daughter, hither; But is it to be thought the King will send Marg'rite of Flanders home, to whom he has been So many Years contracted, the King of the Romans, Her Father, wou'd no doubt highly resent th'Affront. Bris. 'Twou'd be strange indeed, having from her Infancy Been bred in France, and ever since this Charles Came to the Crown she has been titled Queen: The King himself is just strict to his Word Where e're engag'd, but of an easy Nature, Distrusting his own Judgment, whilst so Young He lets himself be govern'd by his Sister, And others of the Council he relies on, And all oppose this Match. Du Croy. Th'event will soon be known, th'Arch-Duke of Austria Being here in Person, they can protract no longer. Bris. He expresses much Affection for his Sister, And seems not pleas'd with the King's usage of her; These several Years they've been of Age to Marry: And then his staying the two last at Lyons, Without once sending to her, looks but ill. Du Croy. And his return to Paris may be suspected, Whilst Ann, Heiress of Brittanie, is here. Bris. I think they've seen each other at your Court; The King was there some time. Du Croy. And 'twas observ'd, She ever since has spoke of him with pleasure, Own'd she admir'd, and wou'd with joy embrace Any occasion of again conversing, With that Great, Young Monarch. Bris. Yet there's appearance Of a strict Friendship betwixt her and Marg'rite. Du Croy. 'Tis certainly sincere, she has a Soul Above deceit, and will be fond of this New Triumph for her Honour; to that she makes Her Love, Ambition, all her Passions, yield; Not as opposing Foes, to conquering Virtue, As Slaves already vanquish'd, so easily they obey. Bris. You speak a Wonder, in a Lady, and so Young. Du Croy. 'Tis true, sometimes the Duke condems her for it, Tells her Dissembling's needful to a Prince, Whose End shou'd be Interest and Greatness only; Still she persists, yet says she is ambitious, But 'tis of being Great within her self, Not in her Titles, or Possessions. Bris. She needs not any, thus pictur'd is she greater Than the Dominion of the World cou'd make her. Du Croy. And yet methinks, a few of those nice Notions Were not ill barter'd for the Crown of France. Bris. Shortly we shall know how she esteems it, If they perswade the King to make the Offer. Du Croy. Be they successful, for the future peace Of Britannie. Think you the King's yet stirring? Bris. I thought e're this he wou'd have left his Chamber: This way he passes, but perhaps he's tir'd With his Journey that he out-sleeps his Hour. Du Croy. 'Twill be a glorious Court, so many Princes Gracing it. Bris. And a diverting one; The King being just return'd, after an absence Of two Years, all will be emulous Of Entertaining him, with Musick chiefly, 'Tis his darling pleasure. He's coming now. Enter the King, Madam of Bourbon, Graville, Du Law, &amp;c. Madam of Bourbon with him on th'other hand, Graville, Du Lau two of the Privy Council, Who have most power with him. King. Thus circled by such Subjects, these Oracles of Wisdom; The Prudence and Affection of a Sister, I have in Youth all the Advantages Of most experienc'd Monarchs. Gra. I'll not decline this Praise to have observ'd And learn't, by all the Troubles in the Reign Of Lowis, your great Father, how t'advise Both for you Majesty's, and your Kingdom's Interest. Mad. If I fail, 'twill be in want of Prudence Not of Love, and seconded by these, I dare pronounce the March we have propos'd, A wise and happy Choice. Du Lau. Much, Sir, you've heard Of the Disturbances which Britannie Gave to your Father's life, so will it you, If not secur'd in peace by Marrying The Heiress of that Provence. King. And so involve my self in guilty War, Unjustly to defend a Breach of Faith. Gra. There is not, Sir, on that side any danger; The King of the Romans is too weak t'attempt Ought against you, and too well loves his Money T'engage in an expensive fruitless War, But barely to revenge your slighting Marg'rite. Du Lau. Her Brother has less Power, since you possess The greatest part of that Dominion With which their Grand-father, last Duke of Burgundy, Was long a formidable Foe to France; Till at the last in raising and extending His own Fame, he ruin'd and depress'd His Family, scarce left 'em to inherit Ought but his glorious Name. King. Yet they'l have Heav'n And Justice on their side. Gra. You wrong 'em not; Nor can you break a Contract which you made not: 'Twas by your Father in your Infancy. When 'twas as necessary for his Interest, As now it is for yours t'evade the Match; And Princes ought, in Marriage, to consider Interest of State alone. King. Thus far I've follow'd Your judicious Counsels to defer My Marriage, till time had ripen'd me for judging: And least I shou'd be sway'd by Inclination, Sister, on your Advice I did absent From Marg'rite, whose Charms might byass stronger Judgments; And now return with all th'indifference Requir'd for a just impartial Choice: But Honour shall direct me, and as with that I can, I will comply in what you offer. Mad. Brother, I question not but you will own, We've not consulted only for your Interest; That Ann of Brittanie's a Blessing, worthy To fill the noblest Heart: But you have seen her. King. With little observation, but as oblig'd In Ceremony at her Father's Court, For all my thoughts were center'd then on Marg'rite. Sir, I'm asham'd your Highness shou'd prevent me, [Enter the Duke of Brittanie I had design'd, by waiting on you first, To shew how highly I esteem the Honour You, and your beauteous Daughter do our Court. Brit. 'Tis a Respect she ow'd your Royal Sister. Mad. A favour I entreated, and have hopes T'enrich the Crown of France with such a Jewel. King. Its lustre wou'd indeed but set off hers, An Ornament she merits, tho' needing none. Brit. Such as she is with her, your Majesty May have at present what Places in the Provence You shall think fit to Chuse; at my Decease all Brittany is yours. King. We shall consult on't. Brit. Has your Majesty determin'd yet, Ought of the Duke of Lorrain's Pretensions? Four Years are now expir'd, in which you promis'd To discuss his Title to Provence. King. They assure me 'twas impartially consider'd, As I charg'd it shou'd, and that they find The Right by which I claim it to be strongest. Brit. I doubt it not; but give me leave thus far To Interest my self (as to the Duke I've undertaken) t'intreat you wou'd dispatch All his Affairs, and what Assistances You're pleas'd to give him for his Expedition Into Naples; daily he's sollicited From the Nobility, t'accept the Gift His Holiness has made him of that Crown, And hasten to relieve 'em from th'oppression Of their Tyrant; he only waits to know Your Resolution, King. The Dutchy of Bar already is deliver'd; (What he can justly claim, I would not make So ill an use of Power as to keep from him:) Nor shall he stay one moment for the Aid I promis'd him, all's ready to attend him, This day, if he think fit. Brit. So Ill' Inform him. Mad. Sir, th'Arch-Duke of Austria. [Ent. Austria attended] King. A Prince Whom my desire to see, wing'd me to Paris. Heir to the Vertues of the Gallant Charles Of Burgundy, whose Spirit by the Mother Was convey'd to this Young Duke, in whom All that was great of him's reviv'd. Aust. He shou'd have left me then A larger Provence t'exert that Greatness in; Unless perhaps mine is a harder Task, And needs the braver Soul, to suffer Wrongs, Which he had power to hinder, or revenge. King. It serv'd but to create him Enemies. Not so much fear'd, in France, as he was hated; Where you, Sir, are a welcome Guest, belov'd, and honour'd. Aust. My Sister too is Honour'd much in Words, Your Subjects call her Queen. King. And I believe In every thing respect her, as she were Queen. Aust. I think, 'tis Sir, her due. King. Her Merit claims it. Aust. To her Rank, I meant, Tho' yet your Nuptials are not Solemniz'd, At which, since unperform'd, I'm pleas'd I shall be present. King. Some time will be requir'd to resolve in. Aus. Resolve! On what? Are you not strongly ty'd; Already in Possession of her Dowre? King. What was deliver'ed, Sir, on that Condition, If I perform it not, shall be return'd. Aust. Is't possible! Dare you affront her thus! Tho' this with cause my Sister apprehended, I'd not believe a King cou'd be so base. King. Take care Young Prince I wou'd not break with you The Laws of Hospitality, or Friendship, But reflect not on my Honour, of that I am my self best judge, and know to govern My own Actions. Aust. You cannot, Poor precarious Prince, these are your Sovereigns, Without whose Leave, you dare not to be just. King. What e're they are, I shall not ask your Leave, To do what I think fit. Aust. No, you believe you may securely wrong me, Whilst you're possess'd unjustly of that Right, By which my Predecessors aw'd your France; But know you shall not unreveng'd add this Injustice; 'Twill be the common cause of all brave Princes, Whose Dignity is struck at, in this Affront To one of equal rank; dread the effect When Power is added to a Soul as daring As that Charles, who made a greater Man [Ex. Austria cum suis] Than you, your Father Lowis tremble. King. I am not to be threatned from my purpose. Brit. These Words wou'd at an Army's head sound well, They're weakness in a Prince, who can but threaten. King. Had he united all the Power of Europe. He might give Laws to France, but never to it's King; I take my Subjects Counsel; that Prince who will not Be advis'd, forgets he is a Man, As he that will be govern'd does that he's a King. Mad. Brother, I think you, or the Duke of Austria, Forget you are a King, that thus unguarded, In your own Dominion, he speaks so boldly. King. That's his Safety, but he's truly Brave, Somewhat I think too hot, and rash, he seems, So I have heard him Character'd, impatient Of the least intended Injury, And from a bare appearance apt to conclude A real one; tho' now we must confess He has just cause. Gra. You both have reason, Sir, The Duke to be enrag'd, your Majesty To give him the occasion, 'tis against His Interest, therefore he is concern'd, You, Sir, have greater Cause to consult yours, In whose a Nation's Safety is involv'd. Du Lau Graville. Has drawn a just Conclusion, Sir, The Example is instructive, your motive is The same against, as his is for the Marriage; If then the Duke's Resentment's reasonable, So, Sir, the cause of it must be from you. King. My Resolution shall be soon determin'd; This I promise, passion shall not sway me. 'Tis time I visit both the Princesses; Let Musick be prepar'd to entertain 'em. Will your Highness bear me Company? Brit. I am to see the Duke of Lorrain this Morning, To let him know your Majesty's intentions. King. My Subjects good shall be my chief concern. But as befits a Monarch, their Noblest Interest, Which he alone consults, and knows to prize, Who dares the rest to Honour, Sacrifice. [Ex. King, &amp;c. Manent, Brittanie and Du Croy. Du Croy. The Duke of Lorrain is much indebted To the Zeal your Highness shews to serve him. Brit. O Du Croy, I have found my happy Rival; Did I not tell thee when with needful caution, I sounded Marg'rites thoughts th'indifference She shew'd for the King's infidelity, Gave me some hopes, but dash'd with stronger fears, Some other secret Love must be the cause, Lorrain's my Rival, blest belov'd Lorrain. Du Croy. And therefore you take pains to make him great, And worthier of your Mistriss. Brit. Therefore he must be gone on any terms, Before the King declares he will desert her; And my appearing Friendship gains me his Trust, By which I shall have means to disappoint, What e're designs Love may inspire him with; Let him succeed unenvy'd in ambition. Du Croy. But has your Highness search'd her heart enough, To be secure you shall succeed Lorrain. Brit. I have as carefully conceal'd my Passion From Margarite's, as from all others knowledge, And look that not a Whisper of it scape thee; Shou'd the King but suspect I had thoughts that way, Fear I might give another Heir to Britannie, Wou'd stop the intended Marriage with my Daughter, Which when perform'd, and as I must contrive, Lorrain remov'd, what have I left to fear; By both abandon'd. For Honour and Revenge she'll mine approve, Rather than bear the Brand of slighted Love. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter the Duke of Lorrain, Duke of Britain, and two Neapolitan Lords. Lor. I will not take an Obligation. From one that has deny'd me Justice. Brit. Not to procure the means to right your self? When you're possess'd of Naples, the King of France May be compell'd to give you back Provence. Lor. And with what Honour cou'd I turn against him, That power which I shou'd owe to his Assistance; No Britannie, Naples without his Aid, Shall be reliev'd, and then without reproach I may in Arms assert and clear my Title. 1. Lord. Great Sir, the Fleet waits you at Genoa, With what Power his Holiness cou'd send you To secure his Gift, which with the Party Of our own Country-men that will join with you, (Whose Resolution nothing can add to But your presence) doubt not you'l find sufficient. 2. Lord. The whole Body of our Nobility Expect you, as the Soul to antimate 'em; But grow impatient of your long delay, And send you word by us, unless you suddenly Appear in their defence, they'll be constrain'd To make their Peace with Ferrand, our Oppressour. Lord. My Lords, so much I owe to the Affection Your Country has express'd for me, to wish I may procure it liberty under Your present King, since in all Revolutions, What e'er particular Grievances are eas'd, The Publick ever suffers. 2. Lord. Too well we know The Tyrant's Nature, and have too far provok'd him To trust him, or expect he'l e're forgive us. 1. Lord. On you, our Eyes, our Hopes, our Hearts, are fix'd, Nor can you, Sir, reject us as a Gift; Which at your choice you might accept or not, You by our common Father as a Blessing Are giv'n to us, and as our right we claim you. Lor. It grieves me they so much depend on one Too weak, much to depend upon himself; But to my power your hopes shall be effected, And with what hast my Destiny permits. 1. Lord. Your Destiny waits, Sir, and calls for you. Lor. My Lords, this is you know the Queen's Apartment. I am oblig'd t'attend her, that Duty paid, At mine you shall be farther Satisfy'd. 2. Lord. We'll wait on your return. [Exeunt Lords Brit. Why seems the Great Lorrain thus irresolv'd And pensive? When his ripe Fate tempts him to pluck, And bending to his Hand courts him to Action; Does it become a Man Elected, By the general Voice a glorious King, The Scourge of Tyranny. Lor. No Britanie, But it becomes a Slave, such as Lorrain; Honour, Revenge, Ambition, all my Passions Obey a stronger power; or rather I Am all one passion, in which the rest, like weaker Flames Attracted by a raging Fire, are lost, And undistinguish'd, burn but to encrease Their wild Devourer. Brit. Ambition, nor Revenge; It must be Love then, makes you seem neglectful Of Honour; nay, give me leave to add, of Duty. Lor. Look on me as another Antony, Who lost the World to follow Cleopatra. Brit. His Life too, and his Fame, unpity'd dy'd, And since condemn'd by all Posterity; Are you Ambitious to be so recorded? Lor. Justly he was Condemn'd, Whose choice was much unworthy such a Sacrifice, One whose prostituted, wanton Love, Had spread her Name with Infamy, Far as his Power and Fame which fill'd the Globe, Ill I compar'd my self, I cou'd not cherish Such a Shameful Passion. Brit. Are you so nice? 'Tis well he is so, this may serve my purpose. [aside Lor. But to lose one whose Spotless Vertue, whose Love, Whose Constancy, whose Worth, outweighs the Worlds? Brit. Why must you lose her? Will not the Crown of Naples Be worthy of this Miracle's Acceptance? Lor. O there is a danger! But if you wish me This Elected King, you may assist me, You say you are my Friend, and in this Cause You must be so, our Interests are united; Hasten your Daughter's Marriage with the King, On that my Peace, my Fortune, Life depends; For without that, I fear Margarite will ne'er be mine. Brit. This Marg'rite of Flanders, th'intended Queen? Lor. She Britannie, unnam'd you well might guess 'Tis She I dote on thus. Brit. Wherefore shou'd this Detain you? Were it not Noble to present A Kingdom, in exchange for that She loses? Nor doubt the King will leave her, of my self This day he ask'd my Daughter. Lor. I dare not trust my Fate with what's so dear to me, Let it dispose of Kingdoms— I am immoveable till she's secur'd. Brit. Then as I truly wish you great, Lorrain, [En. Du Croy I'll use my utmost power to make you so— Du Croy. 'Tis well—Came you in search of me? A word in private—I've heard you say you'd Skill In counterfeiting written Characters, Suppose you try'd it on the King's, as I shall dictate? Du. Cr. Your Highness may Command me. Brit. Attend me then, I'll give you an Original of his Hand— (to Lor.) He tells me the King desires a Conference In private with me, it happens luckily; Believe my Friend I'll serve you with a zeal Beyond your wishes, since I find you thus resolv'd. Lor. 'Tis kind to pity what you disapprove; I am past Advice, indeed. Du Cr. May't please your Highness's, the Queen. [En. Mag'rite Brit. I must retire. [Ex. Britannie and Du Croy] Lor. The Queen, so 'twas he'd call you, Madam. Mar. They think to fawn, and please me with the Title, Which none knows how much I both disdain, And dread, but he that has unlock'd my heart, And sees it's inmost thoughts. Lor. O Margrite! Mar. You seem disturb'd. Lor. And you are calm, O did you Love, Cou'd you be thus, and see a danger near Of losing what you love! Mar. What danger mean you; Lor. Is not the King return'd? Mar. Shou'd that disorder me? Lor. If he shou'd claim his Right of Contract with you? Mar. 'Tis forfeited, does not his strange behaviour, In two Years Absence not once sending to me; His long deferring of our Marriage, And the Proposal has been made to Ann Of Britannie, which from her self I know; Does it not prove his Infidelity? And free me from an Obligation, for which I long resisted that impulse, that Sympathy, That unseen Power, that in spight of me Had made you Master of my Heart, which now With pleasure I submit to; Lor. But is't impossible—O forgive my fears, And if they're guilty, blame my too much Love; Can I reflect that all that tenderness That makes my happiness once blest another, And not fear the flame but stifled, may Revive to my Destruction? Mar. How oft (to Silence this ungrateful Jealousy) Must I repeat, I never lov'd this Charles? Till I saw you ne'er knew what 'twas to Love, But being bred from Infancy together, And looking on him as my destin'd Husband, I cherish'd what esteem he seem'd to merit, Which then (not knowing one I cou'd prefer, Nor having felt a stronger Passion) I Immagin'd Love; yet he perceiv'd my coldness, And oft complain'd that all I did, or said, Was with Deliberation, that at our parting. Or on the greatest exigence, he ne'er Cou'd see me mov'd, beyond my coolest temper; I said 'twas Nature, a defect of Fire; And so I thought it, Is it so Lorrain? Am I insensible? Lor. O, I must own, With Pride, what I've with Extasiy beheld! Yes, I have seen you, when after a long Absence, O let me say we met with equal Fires! That I have seen you for a moment lost, Your melted Eyes confess'd a Soul enflam'd, And doubled all my Transports! Mar. O had my Soul been charm'd before, as now, Cou'd it have e're receiv'd a new impression? If you Lorrain, shou'd prove like him, unfaithful, Think you I e're cou'd love another thus? Lor. 'Tis Extasy to hear you. Enter the Duke of Austria Aus. I am not Grandson to the Noble Burgundy, If this pass unreveng'd. Mar. What offends you Brother? Aus. I've seen this Charles, and find him as you thought, The Stain of Royalty; one that descends To Actions, the meanest of his Slaves will blush In the repeating. Mar. Has he then declar'd— Aus. As to me he durst—that he shou'd dare But think such a Dishonour, to my Sister! Our House be ever branded with the Infamy, If I forgive him. Lor. He more deserves your pitty, than your anger, Who throws a Jewel of such value from him, Unknowing of it's worth, Aus. He must be taught it then, and punish'd for his folly, Lorrain, if you're that Friend you have profess'd, Or if you love my Sister, as you seem, You'll join with me to do her noble Justice. Lor. To ruin all my hopes, and force my Rival To what most I dread! O Austria, think The King's Offence, is what alone can give Your Friend the smallest hope of ever being happy. Aus. Think not I'll ever condescend to give him What he cou'd once doubt, if he shou'd accept; Shou'd he lay all his power at her Feet 'Twou'd not att one, so much I find him now Unworthy of her, I disdain th'Alliance; Take her Lorrain— But with her, make her Injuries your own. Lor. How have you blest me!—When, what must be done? Command my Sword, my Life, I am all yours. Aus. Hast to possess your self in peace of Naples, Then we'll consult of War. Lor. But might I first secure this greatest Blessing. Aus. 'Tis certain, the Affairs of that distressed Nation, Are reduc'd to such Extremity, They need your speediest Aid; I wish you've not Defer'd too long already. Lor. This day, Madam, if you consent, may set My Happiness out of the reach of Fortune. Aus. Since I know your heart, Sister, to save your blushes, I'll have it so, this day, secure a Union, Which I, as much as either of you, joy in. Mar. 'Tis my Duty, Brother, to obey you, But I intreat it may be kept conceal'd, Till the King's Purpose publickly be known. Aus. 'Tis prudently advis'd, I'll dispose My Chaplain for the Secret, and what else Is needful with caution must be manag'd. Lor. I trust to you, my Brother, O you must Contrive, Instruct, do all, for I am yet Too much transported, to deliberate. [Enter Ann of Britannie Mar. The Princess Ann! in this important Moment Appears the truest Friend, the perfectest Of all her Sex; blest be the happy Omen. Ann. Confirm it Fate, what e'er th'occasion be. Mar. One that portends no ill to my fair Rival, Tho' it may prove of consequence to you, Therefore to you alone it shall be trusted. Aus. Lorrain, our selves must be employ'd on this occasion; We may with freedom speak before this Lady; Does ought remain we have not yet consider'd? Lor. Enough, enough, dear Austria we lose time, Away, let's hast, forgive me, Madam, That I am as impatient now to leave you, As I have us'd to be in flying to you; I knew we met but for short joys before, But part this once, that we may part no more [Ex cum Austria Mar. What Blessings cou'd the Crown of France have giv'n me. Equal to such a heart! Ann. And yet I hope, You'd part with that, rather than stain your Honour, Not Wed Lorrain, rather than not deserve him. Mar. Intend you to accuse me? I am not conscious to my self of guilt. Ann. We owe our care first to be justify'd To our own Thoughts, next to the Worlds; I wou'd not have my Friend give an occasion For Malice to reproach her, may not the King T'excuse himself, lay the first Breach on you? Mar. Therefore we shall conceal our Marriage, Till he declare his Falshood. Ann. Innocence needs not such close Coward Arts, As much the punishment of guilt, as it's Security; no Marg'rite, with Actions Fair, and open, as you know 'em just, Upbraid the Crime, that shame's him to dissembling. Mar. To what wou'd you direct me? Thou best guide, And Pattern of Perfection, which I wou'd follow, But with Passion blinded, may need your aid To lead me, more than the Bright Example. Ann. I wou'd advise you instantly write to the King, Tell him that since you are inform'd he means not To perform his Contract, you resolve To give your self by your own inclination; But wait his answer, for your liberty. Mar. Shou'd he not grant it? Ann. Have you a doubt of that, Yet have consented to another Marriage? Mar. I have no cause to doubt, unless accusing Move him to repent, and fear t'occasion What doubly must afflict me, to lose Lorrain, And hinder you of a Possession, you better merit, And wou'd be happier with, than I cou'd ever. Ann. Think not I cou'd be happy in possessing What I knew owing to the Faithlessness, And Infamy of him that shar'd it with me; Tho' were the King so honourably great As once he seem'd, (tho' not this mighty Monarch) I wou'd have chose him from the rest of Princes, How e'er in Power, or Dignity, Superiour, But cannot love, what I must cease to value; O do not lessen that I have for you, Take the Opinion of a Friend unbyass'd, Who has advis'd no more than what she thinks your Duty. Mar. What were too great to hazard for so glorious An Esteem! This moment I'll obey you. Ann. Be Mistriss of your self, and firm to Virtue, So cherish, and reward my affection, that I may ne'er My choice in this dear Friendship disapprove, As I despise the Man I most cou'd love. [Ex. several</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene. Marg'rite's Apartment. Enter the King, Mad. de Bourbon, Brisson and Attendants. Bour. Yet, Sir, e'er you advance, e'er she appear, Grant me thus far, not to engage your word; Think on your Loyal Subjects earnest Prayers, Think we can have no end in our advice, But that which shou'd be yours; shall I prevail? King. Not give my word, can I be more engag'd? By many Vows t'assure her I approv'd My Father's choice, I have confirm'd his promise; Justly she upbraids me, I'm angry with my self For once deliberating on an Action, Which when her Letter did but gently mention, I cou'd not read without a blush of Shame. Bour. Can it be a guilt in you, to grant The liberty she asks? Are you oblig'd When she confesses another inclination? King. If it be so, I only am to blame; But that perhaps is hinted but to try me. Bour. Then she dissembles with you. King. No, I ever found her plain, and artless, It must be true, some one who more deserv'd her She has blest; who can have charm'd that heart Not easily, or violently mov'd; Scarce did it seem t'ave warmth enough for Love. Bour. That which you thought indifference might be then Some prepossession. King. No, you wrong her, Sister, There was an open frankness in her kindness, That shew'd it (tho' not passionate) was intire, So had it ever been had I been just. Bour. Suppose it wou'd, can you now condescen'd To take her Person, whilst her heart's anothers? King. I must with assiduity, with truth, And Love, retrieve it. No more of your perswasions. Enter Ann of Britain, attended. Bour. Most oppertunely Ann of Britannie Is here—then, Brother, let this Lady plead. King. There's Eloquence indeed in Beauteous Eyes; And her's are wondrous charming! They strike, and move me With a strange disorder, something I have not felt; O hide that dangerous Beauty! Which might shake A Stoicks vertue, or tempt a second Adam To break his Covenant, and forfeit Paradice, To find a more delightful one in you! Ann. If I had Beauty, Sir, or any Power, I wou'd employ it in the cause of Vertue, Not against her; and I rejoice she'as kept You on her side, as I must hope, finding You in the Queen's Apartment. King. Does that rejoice you? 'Twas cruel to declare it. Ann. Is it cruel, Sir, to be Sollicitous For your Glory? It speaks a value for you, Else I had seen your Actions with indifference. King. Oh Madam, we acquit our selves to honour well, In sacrificing for it with reluctance What we value, when with joy we part, It seems more for aversion, than for vertue. Ann. A noble heart dreads nothing more than finding The choice it made unworthy, and sees with pleasure It's inclination justify'd by merit, Tho' to the loss of what was dearest to it. King. Durst I apply those tender pleasing Words; How well wou'd they reward whatever Sacrifice Were needful to confirm that valuable Inclination: Let me indulge The flattering thought those Words were meant to me. Ann. my Inclination, Sir, as you're engag'd, Can be of little consequence to know. King. It wrongs not what I owe to any other, To ask how far it might hav favour'd me, had I been free. Ann. Search not with useless curiosity, What were for both better conceal'd for ever. King. You have no thoughts that shou'd be hid, they're Noble all; And I wou'd Prize my self upon the knowledge; You e'er bestow'd a favourable one on me. Ann. True, I have not a thought can raise a blush, Why shou'd they shun the Light? No, I will tell you, whilst your Majesty Honour'd my Father's Court, something I observ'd So Noble in your Soul; nay, I confess too, Somewhat pleasing in your Person, in all your Action, That cou'd have touch'd my heart, had yours been free, Nearer than any Prince I ever knew. King. Oh, there's a Charm in those soft words that might Dissolve the strongest Ties, make me forget All Obligations. Lost in the pleasure to be lov'd by you, And unknown Transports of a mutual Flame. Ann. Oh, Sir, let not what I have express'd seduce Your Vertue, cou'd you be tempted from your Faith To Heav'n and Marg'rite, not all the shining Glories Of your Crown, nor soft Insinuations Of your Love, shou'd bribe me from my just Disdain, Of a dishonourable and impious Alliance, and undeserving my Esteem; Were my Affection rooted with Life inseparable, I'd tear 'em up together. King. There is a greatness In your Nature that delights and fires me With emulation, sure our Souls have been Acquainted, or were created for each other: How fond I am of regulating mine By such a glorious Model. Yes, Madam, To preserve your heart I will for ever lose you. Hast Brisson, inform the Queen I'm here [Exit Brisson. To wait on her hasten; hasten her to th'assistance Of my Vertue, for mine is yet but struggling To that height above the reach of Storms, Where unmolested by tempestuous Passions You are sedately fix'd. Ann. Now you maintain Your highest Character, the awful Image Of a Divine Original Which we Obey and Reverence in Kings, And as you prize the Sacred Stamp be constant To your Self. Bour. Was ever so fantastick An Agreement against their mutual Wishes, There can be now no hopes. [Enter Marg'rite. King. That you had cause to reproach me I confess, For 'twas a Crime to waver in my Choice; But if a free Acknowledgment, and firm Repentance, Stands with Heav'n instead of Innocence, I have that Title to obtain your Pardon. Mar. (Aside.) 'Tis as I fear'd. King. You turn away in silence: Is my Offence too great to be forgiv'n? I have appeal'd yet only to your Goodness, And wou'd not plead t'excuse what I have done, Else I might urge a Nation's good, Of weight sufficient to suspend my thoughts; And if thus far I have let my self be govern'd By those who're watchful for my Interest, no sooner I resume my self than I return To Honour, and to you. Mar. Sir, since your Subjects have so far prevail'd, I now intreat you'l not consider me In prejudice of them, or your own Inclination, Freely I release you. King. Then I'm indeed unhappy, The just Reproaches that I dreaded from you, Wou'd not have been so cruel as this Coldness. Mar. The sense your Majesty seems touch'd with of my Wrongs, Obliges me in honour not to deceive you; I sincerely own your past Behaviour Has quite estrang'd you to my affection. King. I know I've ever had but little interest in it, As in my happiest days I had cause to fear, Which this confirms, you cou'd not else so easily Withdraw it. Mar. I had kindness for you once Sufficient to make my Duty easy; enough You fill'd my heart t'exclude all others thence Which now I dare not promise. King. O Madam, I cou'd never boast that power, Which you insinuate some other has, Whatever place you allow'd me in your heart, You kept your self the absolute Command; How must it grieve me then to find, You could submit it to such a ruling Passion, That now you dare not promise for it's Conduct. Mar. You'l find a Sovereign Cordial for your grief, In that fair Princes; nay, blush not, Sir, nor be confus'd, You may with reason glory in the change, And all Mankind approve your nobler choice King. The slight disorder you with cause remark'd, Was, I confess, rais'd by a conscious thought, Of an Emotion sudden and unusual, I found in meeting first this Lady here; But Oh, the anxious pains I feel, to think You love another shews me you're dearer to me Than my felf Imagin'd. Mar. Th'Effect of Pride, Disdaining what we once possest tho' in it self Not valu'd, shou'd be forc'd from us it seems T'upbraid our weakness with a stronger power, Or want of merit by the preference: But, Sir, our Loves are by caprice, or fate, And ours 'tis plain directed from each other. King. Yet once you say your heart was mine intirely, And what I only lost by my neglect, I'll not despair my future Services, My truth, and perseverance, may regain. Can Musick charm, and soften your resentment? Let it begin— Musick can all the Passions calm, or raise, And whilst it melts, and kindles you to love, I'll watch your Eyes, and the soft Flame improve. They sit, Musick then all rise. After the Musick. I'll not abuse your generous confidence, But nobly will dispute you with Lorrain, Let him who loves you best the Prize obtain; Mean time that to your Honour you'll be just, And to my generous Advocate, I trust. Ex. cum suis Manent, Mar. and Ann. Mar. All leave the Room—(To her Woman. O Madam, what have you done! How miserable Have you made me! Ann. Cou'd you have justify'd Your Marriage to your own thoughts, knowing Your Contract with the King is still in force? Mar. The King was false, is false, and this is but a plot In him, in you, and all Mankind, to plague, And force the guilt on me. Ann. Madam, I wish'd The King wou'd have consented to release you, That both might so acquit your selves with honour; But scorn the baseness of the thought you mention, You know not how to prize a real Friend. Mar. Cruel Friend! Will you deny me this poor priviledge, To rail, to rave, to grieve, when I am wretched! Ann. Forgive me, you indeed have greatly cause, Just in the view of happiness, to lose it! Mar. Ay, there's the aggravation! But oh, not only To be snatch'd from bliss, but then condemn'd To endless torments, another's loath'd embraces! 'Tis too much for mortal bearing! Whirlwinds Rather drive me hence— Or blast me with some horrible infection, To make me hateful to his Eyes, as he's to mine; Come any horror, any Curse, but Marriage. Ann. Have patience, time may work some happy Change, The King may be prevail'd on to desist, Or you to love since he was once so bless'd. Mar. O never, never, Lorrain has been too long A tender dear Companion to my heart, To leave it the least relish for another, To let it know a Joy or peace without him: O tell me how to shun this misery, I cannot bear it, not support the thought; I cannot live, and fear it. Ann. Indeed 'tis sad yet better to be born, Than the reproaches of all the Just and Vertuous Of Mankind, or what's more terrible, The Stings of sharp remors for violated Vows Cou'd you bear that, Consider— Mar. I will consider; But let me first vent my extravangance, Veiw my unhappiness in all its forms, And feel for each anticipated Torture, Then if they do not make me mad, or break my heart, I will consider. Ann. Alass, I pity you, And half repent the counsel that occasion'd Your Misfortune; do you forgive it me. Mar. You did the duty of a Friend, I know you did; But leave me for a while to my destraction, I wou'd alone indulge it to the height, Then 'twill abate, and brooding o'er my grief, You'l find me calm and gentle as a Dove That only in soft murmurs, moans it's dear lost Mate. Ann. May Heav'n compose and guide your thoughts, Farewel. [Exit Ann. Mar. Was e'er a fate like mine, sure the first Wretch That by her Lover's truth has been undone, Many complain of their perfidiousness, A common Vice, and natural to the Sex! But nature must be chang'd to ruin me, A Man cou'd not continue false to leave me happy, Had he been always true, or still been false, But Contradictions reconcile to make me wretched, What hope t'avoid a fate that miracles Are wrought t'accomplish— And nothing less than Miracle can make me live and bear it. There's all my hope that it may wound to Death, Or turn me wild to frightful Savage fury, Or Stupify me till I'm grown insensible Of my Misfortunes, Alass, I rave, When calm Deliberation's necessary, Lorrain will soon be here in height of expectation, And impatience of our Wishes and I Must disappoint 'em, Fate is not that sufficient T'acquit me of the guilt of Perjury, But I must be anothers, spare me that part of misery And let the Sacrifice I make attone, When I refuse to be my self the Victim; He's come, how shall I tell him our sad Doom! [Enter Lorrain Lor. Now, now, my Princess, we've secur'd our happiness Out of the reach of Fate; let's fly my Love, In this propitious minute to our Bliss. Mar. I cannot speak it, [aside. Lor. O do not dash my joy with shy reluctance; Love can dispel the coyest Virgin-fears. Your Brother with a Priest is waiting in the Grove, And my desires too eager for delay. Mar. O Lorrain, do not rely too far On promis'd happiness least unforeseen Our flatt'ring fate betray us, think when our joys Are highest we then are most in fortunes power, And most shou'd fear some sudden turn t'allay Or quite destroy 'em, there can be here no full And yet continu'd Bliss. Lor. Fortune may gratify Her lov'd Inconstancy on all my other Expectations, and checker Life with various Disappointments, yet I shall find in you An over-plus of good to rest my Soul on, That will compensate all secure of that I can bear all her mischiefs. Mar. Is that secure. Lor. We may this moment make it so; this moment Is our own Mar. O no, have you no apprehensions, Yet but this Morning you were full of fears; The King might claim his Contract. Lor. And you dispel'd 'em? My confidence is firmly founded now Upon your Love and Truth. Mar. O did your happiness Depend on that Lorrain, how blest were both, But I in vain have tenderness and truth If fate conspires against us. Lor. Why do you alarm my Soul with causeless Terrors, It needs not to endear you in possession, Have I had any care, or fears, or hopes, Or aim but center'd there, what need of this To heighten my desire. Mar. Or had I e're such Arts, wou'd it were artful all, But there's, alass, a cause too great too real; The King has just been with me, exacts my Promise, And renews his Vows obstinately, Refusing to release me. Lor. I thought that ne'er Cou'd be an Obstacle, when Austria had declar'd Not his Repentance shou'd obtain you of him, But find your Love's weaker than his resentment, That I confess I had not arm'd against. Mar. O that you cou'd justly tax my want of Love, That it had not the power thus to divide me From my self; cou'd raise no tumults in my Breast, But leave me without Struggling to my Duty, I were not then thus wretched. Lor. Love in full vigour feels no opposition, Like Life at it's last ebb the very pangs It gives shews it expiring, Madam, be comforted, The pain's soon past, and a new Life succeeds Of greater pleasures, you'll in the King no doubt Find happiness. Mar. Eternal misery, Add not to my Affliction by this unjust reproach; I fear my Love's too strong that against Honour, Gratitude, all Obligations— O, I feel it ever will contest To make my grief still fresh to give me ever This distracting Sense of what I've parted with, Which nothing nothing else cou'd forc'd me to, But fear to draw upon my self, and what Much more I dread, t'involve you in the guilt And punishment of breaking Sacred Vows. Lor. To day you thought 'em cancel'd, but 'tis your Sexes art To charge th'effects of your inconstancy, On Conscience when e're your fancy's Sated. Conscience is sure t'upbraid, and never fails To find a Plea for the new Inclination; Passion is all your Principle of Conscience, And Interest and Ambition of your Passions. Mar. This from you, Lorrain. Lor. Did I act thus, When Glory courted me, and offer'd Crowns, I slighted both, fool that I was—more fool To think a Woman cou'd resist such Baits, Not to perceive I only was accepted On the King's neglecting you, and your pretended Love for me, but a despair of his. Mar. I thank you, what Honour, Duty, All the King's submissions, or his merit, Cou'd not effect this Insolence has done; And if I can't receive his Love with pleasure I shall be eas'd of mine; no more regret But proud I'm freed from what I now despise; You've shown your self, nor cou'd have pictur'd me So vilely, had you not copy'd your own Soul: My heart disdains to harbour one that durst Admit thoughts so unworthy of it from thence, As from my sight I banish you for ever. Lor. What have I done? O stay— When Mad-men loose their fury on themselves, And hurt what's dearest to 'em, we are not angry, But we pity 'em; inhuman Marg'rite, You torture me till I'm depriv'd of reason, And then condemn for what my madness utters. Mar. Your words, tho' far from truth, seem'd not so wild, As study'd thoughtful malice. Lor. O had I thought The things I said, I had parted from you without Reproaching you as one not worthy my resentment; But to know you as you are divinely perfect, T'have rais'd my hopes to certainty of Bliss, And then to lose you might tempt a Soul less fondly Passionate to prophane like me, and rail At things most sacred; forgive th'extravagance Of an impetuous despair. Mar. Do not ask it. Lor. Is that too much, must I be loaded too With your disdain; alass, my Miseries Were before too heavy to support: Is't not enough to see you torn for ever From me, the All of good I'ad fix'd my Soul on; But must you hate the Wretch you have undone. Mar. O talk not thus, suspect, despise me, rail again, 'Tis easier so to part; but can I see you With all this moving grief, and melting softness, And Ever think of parting: O if the apprehension Be thus tormenting whilst you still are with me, What will it be when we'ere for ever parted. Lor. You have forgiv'n me then, and do not hate me, But time and absence will set me distant to your thoughts, And Duty reconcile you to the King's affection, Which once was not displeasing: Whilst every sad reflection will aggravate my Grief, His happiness doubles my misery, To think him in possession of what I'm curst To live without, blest with your soft Society, Transported in your fond Embraces, every hour Of Day and Night charm'd with some new endearing Tenderness. O the distracting Vision! How will it torture all my Senses, gnaw On my bleeding heart, to add such wounding stings To my despair. Mar. If thus for you to imagine, How much more terrible for me to bear: But let not that disturb you. Lor. Indeed I ought not To disturb you with it, but from your sight Remove the Image I am now of wretchedness, And giving up my self in silence to my Fate, Let desperation work I feel 'twill soon Be its own remedy, Madam, farewel Inquire not, I conjure you, what becomes Of lost Lorrain, least it afflict you in in the hearing; Be blest as Love and Empire join'd can make you. Mar. O stay Lorrain, I cannot let you leave me In the thought I e're can be anothers; I may be forc'd from all that's dear to me, But Fate it self has not the power against My will to give me, on that rely, and judge it By my Love. Lor. Sooth not my pain with vain Delusive hopes, 'twill make it but more sensible, By a new Disappointment. Mar. 'Tis no vain promise, But fix'd resolution; nor If I wou'd, Cou'd I meet his Adresses, but with such loathing As must dash his hopes, and cool the fiercest flame, [illeg.]o no, Lorrain, when we'er for ever parted On that reflection bound thy Sorrows think I past all my dismal hours lamenting, What I've lost, have nothing else in life To do, or suffer, and that's, alass, too much; O more than I can bear. Lor. I ne'er can be secure you'll not be his, Whilst there's a possibility you may; 'Twill tear my heart with agitating fears, Worse than the certainty of what I fear; But if you're truly thus resolv'd against him. Why may you not be mine? 'Tis a nice scruple, of no solid weight, What Injury to him, that I possess What he can ne'er enjoy; Mar. You need not Arguments, one tender look, One soft request, is more perswasive reason! They tell me we had never doted thus, Had Destiny not meant us for each other. Lor. Then when it gave your heart, Fate Seal'd you mine, For Love's a power uncontroulable, And will dispose you all, your heart is mine, Your lovely Eyes consent, your Tongue no more denies, Your fainting Body can resist no longer; O if these pleasing signs of yielding, shou'd Be false, how cou'd I bear the sudden fall, From such a height of unexpected joy! You cannot use such cruelty, When you have power to bless the Man you love! I tremble with my fears, and fierce desire; Speak, can you yet refuse? Mar. I have not power. Lor. You must not, the Priest without is ready, Love impatient. Mar. And not to be withstood! I feel its force; We to be safe, the first Assault must fly, For who cou'd thus be tempted, and deny! [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene. Marg'rite's Apartment. Enter Duke of Britain, and Du Croy. Brit. You're certain he'll be here? Du Croy. Unmark'd I hear'd, The Duke of Austria agree to meet him At his Sisters; Lorrain but stay'd to leave Some Orders, as he told the Duke, with one Of his Attendance whom he cou'd confide in, T'inform him here, if ought of moment happen'd. Brit. They seem upon some secret of importance, I must not slip this opportunity, One Night's delay might frustrate my design. You've done your part Du Croy, the Writing's Undistinguishable from the King's; And fortune too assists me, Lorrain's intending To be here, was luckily discover'd, For meeting me in Marg'rite's Apartment, Will with more probability impose On his belief, the Letter was for her. Du Croy. Sir, I see him coming, Brit. You retire— [Enter Lorrain (aloud) Observe my Orders; I wait the Princess Marg'rite's Leisure to be spoke with, on business which This Night must be effected. Lor. With Marg'rite, such pressing business! Britannie. Brit. To serve a Friend, swift time it self's too slow. Lor. What Service do you intend her? Brit. For you my Friend, I am thus diligent, nay, for you both. The King you know sent by Du Croy this Morning To speak with me in private, he told me He was fix'd on (terms we then agreed on) T'espouse my Daughter, but Margarite having writ T'upbraid his change, he was oblig'd t'excuse Himself to her— Lor. He saw her since she writ. Brit. Not alone? Lor. No, many of his Court Attended him. Brit. Therefore it seems, he had not Opportunity of speaking freely, But writes the reasons of his leaving her. Lor. Since the Visit? Brit. Now, by me, he ask'd If any of my Train might be rely'd on, To give the Letter safely to her self, For 'twas of consequence none else shou'd see it, And his own Subjects were not to be trusted, Being all her Enemies; I offer'd him And wou'd my self deliver it, earnest To bring her liberty, which alone I knew was wanting, to secure her yours. Lor. 'Tis strange!—are you sure it brings her liberty? Did the King shew you what he writ? Brit. He expresly told me the whole purpose of it, But engag'd me, on my Faith, and Honour, How e'er my curiosity might tempt me. To Search no farther the Particulars. Lor. There's Mistery in this! 'Tis but few hours Since he profess'd fidelity to her, And claim'd her for his Wife. Brit. Ha!—a publick Gallantry, a form Due to a Lady's Honour; they must not be forsaken. Lor. I rather think the King abuses you, And for some Ends of Policy, keeps both In hopes; he had not fear'd to trust his Subjects, But with such pretences to this Princess, As they oppose. Brit. That seems probable. Lor. And for what reason else shou'd he so strictly Engage you not to enquire what it contains? Brit. And I may be drawn into injure you, By my officious zeal t'advance your happiness. Lor. If you'd oblige me, Britannie, trust me To give the Letter. Brit. Then I betray the King. Lor. If he deceives you, 'tis but justice; if not, It will be safe with me. Brit. But if he— Or what if—I wou'd willingly—but yet— Lor. I cou'd give you reasons were it fit That wou'd convince you I ought to see it Before Marg'rite does. Brit. I believe you, But then I gave my Honour not to pry Into the secret. Lor. You need not. Brit. You'll let me know, If he dissembles with me. Lor. Certainly. Brit. But methinks— Lor. What? It concerns only one Who conceals nothing from me. Brit. And you'll give it her? Lor. Faithfully. Brit. Yet— Lor. Nay, Brit. Well, take it. To keep my word, I'll leave you whilst you read it. How eagerly he snatches at the Poison [Ex. Britannie. Lor. If he persists to urge his right in her, Tho' now too late, I am so tender of her quiet, I wou'd not she shou'd see it, or mingle with Our Bridal joys, the least uneasy thought. [Opens the Letter, and reads it to himself. Deceive Lorrain—sure my Eyes deceive me, Or the Lights are false—'Tis the King's Hand, And here he owns his Infidelity, Excuses it, but what of me—(reads) necessity— To break—my Kingdoms good—'tis lower, here, But if you carefully deceive Lorrain, What cause have you to grieve at your past kindness, Which we our selves alone, are conscious of—what means he Nor fear I e'er will trust it from my thoughts, But those you grudge me, small pleasure I shall have In the remembring, I once was happy. By the dear possession of all those Charms Which now must be anothers—Damnation! Kings are but splendid Slaves of Sate, As such consider, and forgive me, Charles. 'Tis sure some artifice! But whose? Or wherefore? The Duke of Britannie's my Friend, nor is't His Interest to design a breach 'twixt me, And Marg'rite, had the King aim'd at that, He wou'd not have entrusted him, who's injur'd by it! But might he not employ him without trusting? Perhaps—no, how cou'd he then secure th'effect, It's falling in my hands was accidental, At my own request—but hold—how this Agrees with his refusing to release her Not three hours since?—he's strangely variable In his designs—'twas but this very Morning He confess'd to her Brother he wou'd leave her— Ha! That proves more than all the rest against her, A change so sudden is improbable; She must have feign'd it—perhaps to raise the value Of her gift to me by such a Sacrifice. These are the Arts of faithless, worthless Women, But Truth and Innocence, rich in it self, Not needing labours, not for Foreign Wealth O she is false, dissembling, prostituted, The Words are plain th'authority unquestionable, And I have marri'd her— She has, she has, indeed, deceiv'd me well, How artfully she work'd me to distraction! Shou'd she know how I have found her falshood, So cunningly she wou'd evade the proofs, And look so lovely true, I shou'd renounce My reason, and only trust my ravish'd Senses! O why ye Powers have you giv'n that Sex Insinuating Charms to gain belief, And yet so little truth! damn'd, damn'd, Dissembler! Enter Mag'rite. Mar. Why, my unkind Lorrain, have you thus long Stay'd from me when so near? I cou'd not bear it Longer, nor shou'd you leave me to my thoughts, When you but look on me, you justify All I have done, or all I can do for you; But in your absence, such reflections rise As much disturb me, and for both our quiets I wou'd for ever stifle. Lor. What Power has Conscience! Mar. You seem disorder'd, something troubles you. Lor. I shall not discompose you with it, Madam. (going. Mar. My Lord, you'll break my heart, if thus you leave me; What e'er disturbs you, why to me this coldness? Have I deserv'd it of you? Lor. Ask your self that. Mar. I need not, my Love's so nice, had I a thought That cou'd displease you, 'twou'd upbraid me with it. Why do you talk thus? Whither are you going? Lor. I care not, but from you for ever. Mar. O wherefore? You shall not leave me Till I know whence this unkindness springs. Lor. Look into your Soul, and if you find a guilt. Tho' ne'er so closely hid, think that the cause, And blame your self. Mar. Heav'n witness, I have none to you. Lor. Perjur'd Woman! The King, the King. Mar. I have sin'd to him, indeed,—but how can you Reproach me that? Lor. Shou'd not I reproach you, That you have drawn me in, to share your Shame? Mar. Was not I drawn in by all the art And force of Love? The Shew of faithful, violent Affection! That, I confess, prevaill'd on my weak heart, Unapprehensive of so quick a change; O how was I deceiv'd! Lor. She confesses it—Madam, you've learn'd Of your deceiver well, cou'd I have doubted That you but yielded to my importunity, What the King claim'd his Right in? Cou'd I suspect 'Twas counterfeited all, where so much grief, And tenderness appear'd? Mar. Lorrain, you wrong me, 'Twas but too real; what cause have you to doubt it? Lor. I know it, from himself. Mar. What is't you know? Lor. That he refuss'd to Marry you. Mar. From himself? Lor. From whom else cou'd I know the guilty Secret, Which none else was privy to? Mar. Amazing! What said the King? Lor. I wou'd spare your blushes, Think what he cou'd say. Mar. I dare hear it,— And can clear my self;—at least to you. Lor. O Shameless! To me clear your self! To me Whom you've abus'd! He says, you need not grudge him The remembrance, how happy he was once In your Embraces. Mar. Unhear'd of baseness! Is this The noble use he promis'd of the generous Confidence I made him of my Love; Lor. You have been generous indeed, to him; But on me, revenge his falshood; or rather 'Tis the punishment of Heav'n for Idolizing thee, The guilty folly of cent'ring all my hopes Of happiness on a Woman; The worst, and weakest part of the Creation; O I had fix'd my Soul on thy possession! Had's thou had vertue, I had sought no farther; Nor thought a Heav'n beyond; So Blind, so impiously I doted on this delusive mischief! Forgive me, And I here forswear the faithless Sex, Forswear thy Bed, thy Sight. Mar. Wou'd you be calm, and hear me. Lor. Never, never, let me hear more from thee, of thee, 'T awaken in my memory the Dishonour, The wrong thou has't done me; For thy own Safety, and my Peace, Let me forget thee, 'tis not enough to hate thee, To despise thee, that will be my torment, Whilst I retain the Image of thy wondrous charms, To think how false thou art! For my quiet I must banish thee from my remembrance, Not know thou ever were't—Let me lose all thought Rather than still love on, when I despise This vile bewitching—O I dare look no longer On the lovely treacherous Destruction! Be curst, be wretched, as thou ha'st made Lorrain. Ex. Lor. Mar. O I am curst enough! Lorrain, my Lord, He will not hear me, rage possesses all his Senses! Thus to lose him's worse, is more afflicting Than the loss, had I parted with him When my pressing Duty requir'd it of me, The very cause of our unhappiness Had rais'd his value for me, and I had still Preserv'd the noblest, dearest, part of him; But to be thrown from his Esteem! To think That he depises me; laments that he No sooner knew me, e'er he had ty'd himself To a vile Prostitute! O insupportable! But why do I bear thus? Not fly t'upbraid the King his treachery, To rouze his guilty Soul with torturing Visions Of his future Hell, for that must be The Doom of such a Devil! [going the Duke of Britain enters. Brit. I've heard enough to know I'm unsuspected, (unseen) And must prevent what might discover me. O Madam, I am come on such a purpose As I abhor to speak! And yet I must, Or you, and your Lorrain, my Friend, are lost! Mar. Where is Lorrain? Brit. I left him with the King, And Duke of Austria. Mar. My Brother with 'em! Brit. He met Lorrain, with various passions tost, Reading a Paper that seem'd to raise the tempest, And by the power of Friendship, forc'd from him The Secret it contain'd; which the King (Whom I was with) perceiving, with fury said, Brittannie, as you value your Friend's safety, Hasten to Marg'rite, tell her from me If she deny to Austria, what I've said, When he reproaches her, if she but offer To vindicate her self, she Sacrifices To her honour, her belov'd Lorrain. Mar. What means the Tyrant? Does he think I can Be frighten'd from defending my injur'd Honour? Brit. I refus'd the office, urg'd it's baseness, Threatned to prevent his barbarous vengeance; Nay, take your choice, he cry'd if you oppose, Or offer to disccover what I've purpos'd, You see he's in my power, he dyes this moment. Forc'd by the imminent danger I consented. Mar. Own such a shameful Falshood! I'll dye first. Brit. As he left me to join the Dukes; he added, Hope not to delude me, I'll have a Spy Upon her Looks, her Whispers, the first that tends To accuse me, or clear her self, by Hell, I swear, gives certain death to her Lorrain. Mar. Hell reward him for it! Brit. What's to be done? My Soul is so divided By my concern for you, and fears for him, I know not what t'advise. Mar. How then shou'd I resolve! I who must bear The Shame! Or if I sacrifice Lorrain, All the unhappiness! Brit. I fear you must At present, yield to the hard necessity. Mar. How? Confess my self a thing, that 'tis so shameful But to be nam'd to by another! Brit. Not deny it, till Lorrain's secur'd From the King's cruelty; he may to morrow Set out from hence for Naples, then as I know Your Innocence, fear not I shall find means To justify you, both to him, and Austria, But whilst he stays in France, you cannot clear Your Honour, at a less price than his dear Life, For whom I know, you chiefly wou'd preserve it. Mar. Barbarous imposition! Then keep my Brother from me, I cannot see him. Brit. 'Twere best indeed, if possible, to avoid it. Enter Austria. Mar. O he's here! His Looks dash such confusion, How shall I bear his stinging Words! O whither shall I fly! Aus. Beyond the bounds of being, if thou'd'st escape Thy Infamy, if to search for Peace, Where thy own vile thoughts, may ne'er persue thee. Mar. O that I cou'd become a thoughtless nothing! In pity, Brother, spare me your reproaches, Think I, perhaps, may not so much deserve 'em As you imagine. Brit. O be careful, Madam. Aus. Not deserve 'em! Is there an excuse? For thou do'st not dare deny thy baseness. Mar. Indeed, I dare not. Aus. And did you, cou'd you hope, The King wou'd condescend to Marry you? By Heav'n I forgive him from my Soul; Nay, Honour him for scorning thee, thou blot Of Majesty! Shame of thy Noble Birth, Our Family's reproach, and Curse! O what Inglorious Nation first made so light of Honour, To let in the least depend upon A Woman's Conduct! To put so great a Trust, Into the hands of such frail things as these! Mar. And we in vain may guard, if Fate condemn it, A cruel Fate, like mine, inevitable! O, I shall not hold—urge me not further, Least it produce a Tragick consequence, 'Twill grieve you to have caus'd. Aus. Thou ar't so vile, Thou can'st not have the courage to design Revenge upon thy self, else wou'd I urge thee To rid our House of it's Disgrace, thy self To let out thy hot Blood that first enflam'd thee To consenting; consent, thou must have woo'd him, He durst not have attempted the Dishonour Of one as greatly born as he, of Ancestors In Fame Superiour, had'st thou not allur'd him To thy loose desires—Shame of thy Sex! Mar. I am!—Tho' I did never—I did—I do— I know not what I do— All that the King wou'd have me, I've giv'n up My Honour to his base. Aus. Curse! Curses on thee for it. Mar. O what do I say! And yet 'tis true, my Shame's too real! Betray'd, Confounded with Disgrace!—I must not speak,— I cannot look on any honest Face, Here will I fix my Eyes to Earth, lye level [throws her self on the Ground. With the vilest Dirt, scorn'd, trampled on; Now, now the King may Triumph in my ruin— He shall not, O he knows; he knows I am— I dare not name it! Aus. For Shame thou wou'd'st not. Mar. I cannot suffer this, I'll—O I must, Lorrain's the cause, and can I bear too much! Aus. Never for thy guilt to him, whom thou Ha'st most abus'd! How cou'd he withold From killing thee? Or do I deserve The name of Friend, or my descent from Burgundy, And suffer the Dishonourer of both To live! Dye wretch to expiate thy foul Sin. Brit. Hold Austria, hold your desperate hand, you shall not— Mar. Hear me Heav'n, that know'st my Misery, I wish to live but till this Stain's wash'd off; Grant that, and I resign my wretched Life. Aus. Live then to clear thy Soul, but live recluse, In Fasting, Discipline, and sharpest Pennance; Pass thy days, be Tears and Prayers thy Food; Bury'd from the World, forgotten by Mankind, Forget thy name, thy self, all but thy guilt; Which tho' I'll ne'er forgive, Heav'n may at last; But all thy wretched Life in Mourning wast, What e'er's to come, lament, and curse the past. [Ex. Austria Mar. Enough, enough, just Heav'n, my Miseries Are full, for human nature can support no more; And only Love cou'd make it bear so much. Brit. Dear Madam, your Afflictions grieve me to the Soul: Sure when the King's inform'd of 'em he must Relent, I'll try what can be done to move him, Or secure my Friend; and till I wait on you, I beg your patience; least your just resentment Prove fatal to your self. Mar. I must relye on you Good Britannie, a poor weak Woman; can But ineffectually lament, or rail; And thus to grieve is the more descent weakness. Brit. Your Sorrow shall be short, I go to serve you. (aside) Her rage against the King, was most my fear, Now to remove Lorrain, and all's secure. [Ex. Brit. Mar. There is not sure on Earth a Wretch forlorn like me? Those whom malicious Tongues have most aspers'd; Find still some Friends t'assert their Innocence, Or in whose Esteem they rest content, The Witnesses of their most artless actions, Hid from the World in privacy, and silence; Vertue's best evidence, and noblest Provence; O 'tis sufficient comfort; the only valu'd Approbation of these few dear intimates; But by them abandon'd, curst, despis'd, Mankind's Applause cou'd make no recompence. Another Friend t'upbraid my real guilt! Enter Ann of Britain. Ann. A Tyranny unparrellel'd! I've learnt my Friend, your strange inhuman Usage, Meeting my Father when he came from hence; He told me as in hast he cou'd; a baseness Of the King scarce credible! With pain I cou'd restrain my impatient Indignation For a moment; to give my Friend some comfort. Mar. You cannot, O you will not pity me, When you know the justice of my Sufferings. Ann. The justice of 'em! Mar. I have deserv'd it all! Lorrain's my crime, and 'tis but equal punishment To be depriv'd of that for which I sin'd; I see the hand of Heav'n in it, and submit. Yet don't insult, leave me as all that's dear On Earth have done, a lonely, wretched, An abandon'd Wife. Ann. Marry'd! Then there's no certain worth, On which to found a firm, exalted Frindship; I saw in you, a stock that promis'd much, Adopted you my charge, thought it my business, And my Glory, to support, to cherish, And improve your blooming Vertue; Nor ever had desisted from my care, How e'er ungrateful you had prov'd to me, Had you not been unfaithful to your self, Corrupted by deceitful, ruinous Passions. Mar. Ruinous indeed! For it has lost me All I had of worth, my Love, my Fame, My Friend! I have assisted to my wretched Fate, But was inevitably doom'd unhappy. Ann. No Madam, had you chose to bear th'uneasyness. —Your Duty pointed to, Heav'n had been Engag'd to your protection, that can extract Good, from extreamest Ills, and ever from Such Sacrifices, draws some unforeseen Event, that makes it prove ev'n here a Blessing; But when indulgent to our vicious Passions, In defiance of Heav'n it self, we will be happy, Break through all restraints to our desires; Some sudden Disappointment dashes th'enjoyment, Shews us how vain our Hopes, how false our Judgment, And leaves us desolate, without a refuge, But in a sad Repentance. Mar. O! I have felt that Truth, And dare not in my miseries ask assistance From that Sacred Power I have offended; But if a penitent may be accepted, Hear my Petition, and this Solemn Vow; (kneels If thou art pleas'd to clear my Innocence From this unjust Reproach, in acknowledgment, And to attone my other Faults, I here protest, To sacrifice my dearest Inclination, And Dedicating my whole Life to Heav'n, Deprive my self for ever of Lorrain: My fond, my doting Love for whom, betray'd me To that guilt, for which I am thus rigorously Punish'd Grant my request, and if I fail In what I've vow'd, with heavyer plagues, (if there Are any such) avenge my Perjury. Ann. O we are all fair promisers in Affliction; You see not now Lorrain, raving, desparing At your Resolution, pleading with all Those charms, that tenderness, that once prevaill'd; They've still their force, and you have the same Weakness, So mov'd again, you'll think no punishment So great as losing him, and with him any, All are to be born. Mar. No, I at once have prov'd 'em both, and find Experimentally, no Torments equal To remorse of guilt, it incapacitates For all enjoyments; but in the depth of wretchedness, The calm of Innocence gives sweet refreshments By it's own delights, and future promises; O I have lost it! And with it the best aid To my weak virtue, since I'm now unworthy Of your Friendship Ann. Your quick return regains your Title to it, Your sufferings to my pitty, and assistance; By power undaunted I'll proclaim your Wrongs, And through this thickning Mist shew the King's Malice, The black obstructing Cloud, from which it fell, Whilst your bright Honour kept it's purest luster; This be my care to clear, your Task is more, Unstain'd preserve, the Glory I restore. Mar. So prosper your design, but O beware, Lorrain's dear Life, be your first greatest care, Tho' lost to me—what must be now my State, When my best Wish, is such a wretched fate!

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene. A Garden. Lorrain lying on a Bank, the Duke of Britain standing by him. Brit. For Honour's sake, shake off this Lethargy, Exert your self, and rouze your Soul to Glory; Look on this Disappointment as design'd To set your thoughts on new, on nobler pursuits. Lor. I've done with all, my stock of hopes, and Wishes, All were in one venture, they're lost, And I've no more to hazard, 'tis not in nature now To give me a desire. Brit. O you're mistaken, Desires the very Essence of our Being, As insufficient to it self, the mark Of our dependance; and this indifference To all things else, shews you still dote on Marg'rite. Lor. Can you think so low, so poorly of me? Dote on a Woman in her self so vile, (rising. So base to me! Brit. Then you have no excuse to loyter here, Neglecting prostrate Nations, that but ask you To accept Dominion; not Anthony Whom you so much condemn'd, so carelessly, So stupidly, threw fortune from him. Lor. No, for what he lost in Empire, was o'er pay'd, In a long pleas'd possession of that Beauty He priz'd above the World; Blest Anthony! Who rightly knew t'enjoy with most advantage Things so mutable, not let reflections Of the past, devour the present good; Mark Anthony perhaps rejoyc'd that she Who once was Cæsar's, now gave him the preference. Brit. So cou'd you, you wait but her Submissions, a few Tears. Some light Excuse, and Vows of future faith, Wou'd soften, vanquish you, or rather, shew How much a Slave you are. Lor. To a Strumpet! I disdain it, scorn her, loath her, Damn her— She has caught me in the nooze, and thinks me fast, But 'tis most dangerous being in a chain'd Lyon's reach, whose fury's urg'd, and doubled By restraint; she'as bound me to her own Destruction, shall know I am a Husband But by my Tyranny. Brit. Marry'd! then all's defeated. Lor. No Britanie, I'll instantly to Naples, The air she breaths is loathsome; that I am marry'd Is my Charter for tormenting her, therefore pleases me. Brit. And I've been plotting to prevent, what's past. O Sluggard mischief, that with all thy wings, Shou'd lag behind, and let desire out-stript thee! (aside. Enter the two Neapolitan Lords. Lorrain walking disorderly 1st. Lord. We've Orders, Sir, from Naples, to tell your Highness Your delay t'assist 'em forc'd 'em t'accept The King's concessions, and having giv'n up The power they held, 'tis now too late t'attempt their freedom. Lor. So, Iv'e only then a Wife to govern, That's work enough. Tell Ferrand I may visit him Perhaps, to learn the art of Tyrannizing. 2 Lord. Sure he's not himself! Brit. somewhat disturbs him. 2d Lord It seems some raging passion. 1st. Lord. And I fear has long possess'd him, bounded His aspiring thoughts, whose Soul was form'd To check th'ambition of usurping Kings, And keep the World in Balance. Lor. She was the same, this very false, polluted Creature, when first she charm'd me, when ev'ry look, When every tender word, gave me transporting Pleasure! Not dreaming they were all dissembled; O what a happiness have I exchang'd For a sad knowledge! The Curse of Adam, is Entail'd on all his Race, and those who know The most, are the most wretched Brit. You see him discompos'd, my Lords, and since You have no more t'expect, 'twere best to leave him. 1 Lord We will, tho' griev'd to leave him thus, for much I honour'd him. Ex. Lords. Brit. I wish, Sir, I had known your Marriage sooner, Perhaps it had been better—yet you may find— —O Curst design—but—'tis past—well, she's your Wife Lorrain—it concerns you now to think the best, She may be wrong'd—believe it, I advise you, Restore her to your Love—for your own sake forget, Or by her future conduct, judge the past. [Ex. Brit. Lor. Forget! Restore her to my heart! Guilty, And shameless, to triumph in her treachery, Allur'd to prostitute embraces, the relicks Of another's satiated Lust; O vile immagination!—. And this they durst design t'impose upon me, The King, and his cast—confound 'em! Was I sought out, as fit for such a purpose! With Slavish appetite, to take contentedly The scraps he had thrown from him! By all my wrongs, They shall not find me form'd of such tame Stuff— —Yes Viper you have Stung me, [Ent. Mar. and Ann. But yet the Poison has not reach'd my heart, It but enflames my Blood—Ha here—Yes, you have rouz'd me To punish both, both partners in so foul, so base an injury! Mar. O, my Lord, upon my Knees I beg you but to hear me. Lor. No, receive it as a grace that I refuse you, That I avoid the place where e'er you are, To spare your shame in looking on the Man You have abus'd—'tis the last time—O Marg'rite! [Exit. Mar. I came to look my last, and never wou'd Have troubled you again, nor will pursue him farther; Here will I cling about my Parent Earth, Till her kind bosom open to receive, And free from all woes the most unhappy Child she ever bore. Ann. Alass, it is not now A time for Counsel, or to offer Comfort. Enter King, Bourbon, and Attendants. Bour. What strange Chimera in the form of Honour, Incites you to oppose your own desires, To make another wretched? What Paradox Of resolution! To which both seem averse, Yet unconstrain'd persue. King. Neither I hope averse. Bour. Behold her then, whence such depressing grief? What means that posture of despair? King. Weeping, and on the ground? I wou'd not so afflict her Nor meant to force, but win her inclinations. Madam, if ought I've done, has caus'd this sorrow, Believe I hop'd a gratefuller effect; And will no more oppose Lorrain's Pretensions, Since I perceive mine give you such disorder. Mar. Tyrant you've done what is not in your power to retrieve. King. It is, it shall be, I renounce my words, Resign my Right, and to have no pretence Of future Claim, transfer it to this Princess, Who, if She condescend to share with me The dignity of Sovereign, I give the Power entire. Ann. Both I disdain. What you can give, or be a Partner in, Must be unworthy me; think not I less Resent her injuries, than she her self, Who Sinks beneath their weight; Or knowing thy vile falsehoods fram'd against her, Can less abhor th'alliance. King. Vile falsehoods! speak Madam, have I done ought, Not to be justifiy'd to Truth, and Honour? (to Mar. Mar. To Truth! dare you look on me, and affirm it! (rising. O, I appeal to Heav'n, and your own Concience, If you can tax my Honour, with an action, That I need blush at, tho' Mankind were Witness. King. Not tax your Honour, what mean you Madam? Mar: Amazing confidence! Ann. He that durst do it in the face of Heav'n, Will not be aw'd by helpless innocence; But think not your barbarity can fright me From her Vindication, or publishing thy Infamy. King. What Infamy? Wherefore these warm reproaches? Madam, what e'er your Accusation is, By all that's great, I am not conscious To have wrong'd the Princess. Mar. O, wherefore this! What wou'd you more? You've parted me for ever From Lorrain, and yet have found I priz'd His Life above my Honour, I've Sacrifis'd it To your wicked purpose; Is it too little? Must you insult me in the shame and misery You have brought on me! King. More unintelligible! What strange delusion has possess'd you both! How have I prejudic'd your Honour? Or what Design'd against Lorrain? Who has accus'd me? Ann. Think not my Father will conceal your Crimes, Tho' accessary, to prevent your blacker Vow'd design; from him I know Your cruel imposition on the Princess. Who tho' her value for the life you threatned, Aw'd her to silence whilst Lorrain was with you— King. Still more obscure! what Threats? What Imposition? How—when Lorrain with me? I have not seen Lorrain since my return. Mar. So obstinate in malice! O too often, And too fatally you've seen him, had you not boasted To himself, he cou'd not have beleiv'd On less authority, such shame of me, With which you only know how falsely you asperse me. King. And this the Duke of Brittannie affirms? Mar. Lorrain affirms it, too nearly struck In my dishonour, to bear it Silently, Urg'd with contempt, and rage, declar'd you Author. King. 'Tis false as Hell, a base invention, fram'd To justify his change, the Coward's Honour, And the Villain's vertue, fearing t'avow Their nature's smallest frailty, dare to disguise it By the blackest crimes, an impious Courage! Ann. Such is thine, That guilty first of the most hellish Actions, Dar'st throw the infamy on those thou'st injur'd. King. Madam, again I assert my innocence, More is not to be said when Ladies rail; Lorrain I know to answer, confront me with him, By Royalty, by my more Sacred Honour, Which he had dar'd prophane he shall confess it; Search, search him instantly, summon him here To face an injur'd King—No, warn'd he may fly In dread of my just Vengeance; my self will trace him, Through all the Pallace, resound the hateful Name, Lorrain false, treacherous Lorrain, Lorrain. (going. Enter Lorrain. Lor. Sure the King's voice—and darest thou call Lorrain! Whose sight to thy confusion, must upbraid thee With his Wrongs, less insupportable In what unjustly thou detain'st of mine, Than what to free thy self, thou woud'st impose on me But tho' I've thrown the vile dishonour off, The base design, shall not be unaveng'd. King. I dare defie thee, back'd with all the power Of thy Confederate Friends, who help'd thy malice In this black Contrivance, and gives thee now A rash, infernal daring to persist in falsehood To me, thus boldly, who must know it false, As surely as thou know'st me innocent, Of thy invented Scandal on the Princess. Ann. Your Justice cannot now Lorrain, give credit To a Man you've heard deny, what first He to your self affirm'd, that shews him false, And when you know how he persu'd his treachery against the Princess— Lor. Madam, her Injuries concern me not, How I have been abus'd, I know from him. King. From me! Unworthy Prince! Dar'st thou in arms Defend thy Accusation? Thou can'st not be So desperate, t'expose thy Life, in such A wicked cause; therefore recant, or doubt not In thy Blood, my Honour shall be clear'd. Lor. I accept thy Challenge, be the injur'd Victor. King. The guilty, in this Infamy be punish'd, Discover'd to his never dying shame, and all Mankinds contempt. Lor. Then to the World Proclaim it, witness thy self against the guilty, And thy own words be prooff. [Giving him the Letter. King. My hand it is. [Reads it to himself. What it contains is a base Lye, and this A Forgery, more plausibly to throw the villany on me. Lor. Oh 'tis too late, she has her self confess'd it. King. Confess'd! Ann. Thou know'st she durst not otherwise, to Lor. fearing your Life, which if she justify'd her self, he vow'd to take. King. Distraction! When? To whom? Ann. The Duke of Britannie, who saw you in his power, (to Lor. And had he warn'd had giv'n you certain death: Forced (to prevent it) on that fatal Message, But just declar'd that moment when the Tyrant Met with you and Austria. Lor. Your Story's ill concerted, till now I have not met him. King. Thou speak'st a truth, tho' to abuse it, serving Thy falsehood with it; what depths of impious cunning! This was contriv'd to be secure from Austria's vengeance, Mine thou shalt not escape, prepare for thy defence Against my single Sword, me thou hast injur'd, And 'tis not just Nations shou'd be engag'd for private wrongs, Lor. I thank thee, as the most equal, 'Tis the speediest way, and suits with my impatience; Did not the presence of two noble Princesses Make the place sacred, here I wou'd engage thee; Marg'rite has forfeited all the respect Due to her Birth, and it wou'd please my justice, In her sight to punish the Accomplice Of her shame, her treachery, for that's The vilest part, the mean deceit to me; With what engaging Arts, what shew of tenderness! O 'twas deceitful all—but how transporting! Wou'd thou cou'd'st perswade—what wou'd my easy heart! It softens, seems to shake my Resolution, And I grow tame in gazing—Thou shalt not triumph— I disdain—my Soul resumes her self— She shall not— Mar. If e'er Lorrain— Lor: Do not talk— I must not stay to hear thee—think not—never— I will not see thee more—We, Sir, shall meet. (going Enter Duke of Austria. Aus. Stay, Brother, all is well, we've been abus'd, And wrong'd my Sister, she's innocent Lorrain. Lor. Blest Voice! oh, my eas'd heart 'twas just screw'd up To such a height, it must have been relax'd, Or break; Oh how shall we attone? How be forgiv'n? Aus. You know not yet how I have learn'd the truth. Lor. No matter, you have said she's innocent, I'd not enquire farther, least it shou'd raise a doubt, But here you swear, and gaze, and swear it too; She is, I see it in her eyes, I know it By my heart, I cannot bear the pleasure That it feels—a change to such extreams! The sudden transport kills! Oh, tis too much! Aus. This will remove all doubts, and fully clear her. (gives a Letter. Lor. What? From whence?—'Tis needless—but it speaks Of Margarite, and Innocence, and I will read it. Aus. The Duke of Brittanie has secretly Withdrawn from Paris, and left this Letter To be giv'n me, and do my Sister justice. Mar. A faithful Friend. Now Tyrant all thy malice will appear. Aus. The King is innocent of this deceit, And Brittanie the sole Contriver. Ann. How! Aus. Madam, your pardon, on his own authority I may presume to speak it. Ann. Let truth be known, who ever it condemn. Aus. A raging, hopeless, Love for Margarite, he says, inspir'd this desperate Contrivance, to prevent her Marriage with Lorrain; But hearing it already was perform'd, Repenting of successless mischief, this confession Is all the satisfaction he can make. Lor. Gladly, I forgive thee. King. The Princess Margarite already marry'd! Aus. Yes, Sir, by my consent, scorning she shou'd Attend, till you thought fit to cast her off, I gave her to a Prince deserves her better. King. Austria, you judg'd my words with too much heat, I wou'd have kept my faith with Margarite, And offer'd her the Crown, as she in justice To me, must confess. Mar. I must indeed—a truth that has undone me! (aside. King. This I declare to court a reconcilement, not asham'd To own I had rather have a Gallant Man My Friend, than Enemy. Aus. I am no Enemy but to Injustice, To Honour, in whom ever found a Friend, By that you now engage me. King. Since Margarite has acquitted me, may I presume Most noble Princess, you are not displeas'd To find my Honour clear'd. (to Ann. Ann. Judge by my past behaviour, in this case The means by which you're justify'd, makes silence best become me. Aus. Are you convinc'd Lorrain? Lor. Convinc'd! struck dumb with shame, and conscious guilt. I dare not speak to her. Aus. She is all mildness? not a spark of my too fiery temper, Calm, and forgiving, with the same tenderness Will now receive you, as you had never wrong'd her. Lor. I do not ask it, here devest my self Of the authority a Husband claims, And new begin my Suit; look on me, Madam, As an humble, guilty Suppliant, Who will submit to any sufferings That may prevail upon your pity, and readmit Him to your favour. Mar. Assist me Heaven! Ann. Now my poor Friend, does not your melting heart Repent your Vow? Mar. But shall not break it tho' 'tis a cruel tryal! Lor. You will not deign an Answer, I deserve none But to reproach me; in this submissive posture, (kneels That speaks my heart, and my dejected state, insult me then. Mar. O Lorrain, wou'd you have heard me speak In my defence, all might have yet been well. Lor. 'Tis not to be excus'd, nor can I hope You shou'd be less obdurate to my prayers, Or blame you tho' you never do forgive, or hear or see me more, Mar. Rise, my dear Lord, I from my Soul forgive you. Lor. You call'd me dear, O can you love me still. Mar. More than my Life,—yet we must part for ever. Lor. Is that forgiving! What can your hate do worse? Mar. In vain we oppose our Destiny, which first Reviv'd the King's Affection, to disjoin us; Yet still we strove with fate, broke to each other Through all Obligations, Conscience, and Honour; What Judgment next was sent to part, and shew us Heav'n was displeas'd— Lor. But now is reconcil'd, cou'd you be so. Mar. A Solemn, and irrevocable Vow, Now serves the Will of Heav'n; by so immediate Punishment, so plainly pointed at my guilt, Made conscious of it, I vow'd if Heav'n wou'd clear My Fame, for ever to deprive my self Of the dear Cause both of my Sin, and Sufferings; My Prayers granted, shews the Sacrifice accepted. Lor. 'Tis, Madam, you have now full power To gratifie your hatred, and disdain. Mar. Alass, Lorrain, can we contend with Heav'n? Aus. 'Twas rashly made, and not obligatory, Null'd by your Marriage-Vow. Mar. That was it self null'd by my former Contract. Yet cou'd the King's consent now justify it, 'Tis cancell'd by a greater, allow'd you know Of force to breake it, wedding us to Heav'n. Aus. I wish indeed it never had been made. Lor. Do you confirm it? What authority, What Law—but 'tis in vain, no Casuists, No Canons, can convince like inclination, You wou'd have it so,— Go, Madam, and be satisfy'd you shall Have full revenge, if when you have left me I e'er forgive my self, or tast a joy, Or end my Miseries but with my Death, May they be doubled on me after Death. Mar. Must I give such affliction! My poor Lorrain, Your Sufferings are the saddest part of mine! Lor. All will be well, I have not long to suffer. Mar. This is the fatal grief, that seeks no vent, But inward works, and preys upon the Vitals; his Eyes are fix'd, despair seems to have chill'd his Blood, and stupify'd his Sence! I cannot see him thus! My Lord, my Love, what must I— O Madam, now assist, take, force me from him. Or I shall yield, forget my Vow, fly perjur'd To his Arms, and bring a heavier Curse On this dear Prince, than that he now laments. Lor. Be not concern'd for me, I can submit Without repining, to your Will; may I not take One parting Kiss? I shall no more disturb you. Mar. Oh my heart! Lor. She pants, and trembles in my Arms! O can you love me thus, and leave me! No, You will not, cannot! Say, can you tear your self From my fond clinging Arms? Now whilst I hold you To my panting heart, now pluck it from my breast, Now say you'll leave me, will you Marg'rite? Mar. Never, never, I'm rooted here, What is there in our Loves to displease Heav'n? Lor. Nothing, we're join'd by Heav'n, and all these joys, These raptures, are divine! Ann. She's lost! What resolution can be trusted! Mar. Grudge me not one moments bliss, Since 'tis my last. Lor. Ages are yet to come. Mar. No more, I dare not trust my self again In those bewitching arms; O, do not tempt me To our mutual ruin. Lor. What means my Love! Was all this kindness then But feign'd, to torture me more exquisitely! When my desire enflam'd, flush'd with my hopes, In reach of all my joys to snatch 'em from me! Mar. I wish I better cou'd command my self, For both our quiets; but yet my heart, acquainted As it is with grief, cannot in sight Of my Lorrain, be quite insensible of joy, For 'tis a blessing but to look on thee; Must I lose that too, never see thee more! If Life's a good, why is it not ta'en from me, When I'm depriv'd of every other good? But then 'tis misery, and therefore left me, O Tyranny of Fate! Lor. If this concern is real, can'st thou leave me? Or can I see thee thus, and part with thee! Mar. Think it dissembled, if 'twill be for your quiet; Think any thing to make your loss the lighter. Lor. No, I know thou Lov'st me, I know thou canst not See thy poor Lorrain, thus trembling, weeping, Fainting at thy Feet, and not relent; (kneells Thou know'st I never can have ease without thee, And will't thou make me wretched? Will you not look on me? Mar. I dare not, O Madam, Brother. Ann. We'll attend you. Mar. No, I conjure you stay to comfort him, You ne'er can give me any, but to hear Lorrain's at peace, if I sought comfort wou'd, I go from him! Lor. Stay Marg'rite, thus prostrate I intreat thee, I will not ask thee not to leave me, but will't thou Leave me thus?—Sure we shou'd part like Lovers, Take a thousand sad Adieus, one last Embrace, can'st thou deny me that? Remember 'Tis my last request, and the last blessing Thou will't ever give me—she turns, I cannot Rise to meet thee; O hasten to my Arms Whilst they have strength to clasp thee, Or my faint life will fail me e'er you reach 'em. Mar. I am half vanquish'd, but in looking on thee! I must not—yet I wou'd take—O 'twill undoe us— Can I refuse—O Lorrain, what do I suffer When languishing to meet thy expecting Arms, I tear my self for ever, ever, from thee! (Ex. led by Women. Aus. She faints, support, lead her away—Lorrain, Bear your self like a Man, my friend, you've lost Nothing essential to your happiness, Was Marg'rite wanting to it, e'er you knew her? Your state is now the same; our false immaginations Gives us necessities, that nature wou'd not feel. Can make our peace depend on every thing It represents a good, tho' the most forreign to it! Think your self now, as if you ne'er had known my Sister. Lor. Preach to a Wretch that's tortur'd on the rack, Bid him imagine he's at ease—do I not feel? Is it not real misery to lose The only thing I love? Cou'd I have lov'd If I had never known her? Sophistick nonsence! Here, here, are these pangs nothing?—Why did you (rising Let her go?—Think you I'll live without her? Aus. Be Calm, we must submit. Lor. I will not, She's my Wife; I'll claim her from the Priests, From Heav'n, I'll claim her at the Altar, rage, Curse, invoke—something I will do there, Or dye, or force her thence—I will not bear. (Ex. Lor. Ann. Unhappy Pair! let us correct our selves By these Examples, seeing how vainly They sought happiness, in following Unruly passion, that blind, as rash, ever With inconsiderate hast, obstructs it's own designs. Aus. 'Tis a blind guide indeed, yet with well meaning zeal But leads us from our way; base treachery Taking by Paths, through dark and muddy ways, Sinks us in filth, which tho' we gain our end, Exposes us to shame, Discovering The vile Steps we trod. King. But we who sacrifis'd to Vertue, our desires, Have in submissively resigning, Obtain'd our utmost Wishes; th'event of things Wise Providence directs, leaves nothing to our care, Or charge, but our own actions; Yet with Preposterous idle diligence, We to dispose of Destiny project, And the small Provence in our power neglect.
