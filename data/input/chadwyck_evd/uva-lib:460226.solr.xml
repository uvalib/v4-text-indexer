      <field name="fulltext">âScelerate, revertere, Theseu; Flecte ratem; numerum non habet illa suum. Ovid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MALEVOLI.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. MEN. Periander, King of Naxos. Theseus, Pirithous, Archon, an officer of Periander, Aletes, Ambassador from Minos, King of Crete. WOMEN. Ariadne, PhÃ¦dra, Virgins, attending on Ariadne, &amp;c. Scene, the Isle of Naxos.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the FIRST. Scene, a magnificent Apartment in Periander's Palace. A violent storm of Thunder and Lightning. PhÃ¦dra and Archon. PhÃ¦dra. Away! no more:âwhy thus pursue my steps? Begone and leave me; leave me to my woes. Archon. Yet, PhÃ¦dra, be advis'd. PhÃ¦dra. Presume no further. Advis'd by thee! no, let your pliant king, Your king of Naxos, to thy treach'rous counsels Resign himself, his people, and his laws. Thou hast undone us all; by thee we die; Yes, Ariadne, PhÃ¦dra, Theseus, all, All die by thee! Archon. Princess, your fears are groundless. Your timorous fancy forms unjust suspicions. If you but knew meâ PhÃ¦dra. O! too well I know thee. This very morn tis fix'd; yes, here your king Gives audience to th' Ambassador of Crete; Here in this palace; here, by your persuasion, He means to yield us to the rage of Minos, To my vindictive father's stern demand. Ere that I'll see your king; here wait his coming, And counteract thy base ungen'rous counsel. Archon. This storm of passion bears your reason down. Let prudence guide thee. In a night like this, Why quit your couch, and to the whirlwind's rage, The vollied light'ning, and the war of nature, Why wilt thou thus commit thy tender frame? [Thunder and lightning. Again that dreadful peal!âAll-gracious pow'rs! What crime provokes your wrath? must this fair island, That long hath flourish'd in th' Ãgean deep, Must Naxos with her sons, a blameless race, Burn to the centre, and the brawling waves Close o'er the wreck for ever? [Another clap of thunder. PhÃ¦dra. Oh! that burst Shoots horror to my soul. Archon. Thus through the night Hath the wild uproar shook the groaning isle. Fierce rain and liquid fire in mingled torrents Came rushing o'er the land. The wrath of Heav'n Rides in the tempest. Tow'rs and sacred domes Fell in promiscuous ruin. Ships were dash'd On pointed rocks, or swallow'd in the deep. Destruction rages round: amidst the roar, When all things else, when ev'n the fiercest natures Shrink from the hideous ruin, you alone Walk through the storm, with fierce, with haggard mien, A form that suits the dreadful wild commotion. PhÃ¦dra. Yes, with a heart, in which the storm that rages, Surpasses all the horrors of the night. Yes, here I come supreme in misery. I only wake to cares unknown to him Who treads secure the paths of humble life, And thanks the Gods for his obscure retreat, For the blest shade in which their bounty plac'd him. Archon. 'Twere best allay this tempest of the soul. PhÃ¦dra. 'Tis you have rais'd this tempest of the soul. You, Sir, are minister; you govern here, And bend at will an unsuspecting monarch. To thee he yields, his oracle of state; And when with wrongs you have oppress'd mankind, 'Tis the king's pleasure; 'tis the royal will. Archon. Unjust, ungen'rous charge! have you forgot, When first your vessel reach'd the coast of Naxos? You sued for leave to land upon the isle: You and your sister Ariadne sent To pray for shelter here. Ere that we heard Theseus was with you; Theseus, whom the state Of Athens sent a sacrifice to Minos, A victim to absolve the annual tribute, Impos'd by conquest: Ariadne's love, Her generous efforts to redeem the hero, Ev'n then were known at Periander's court. The wond'rous story on the wings of Fame Had reach'd our Isle; she pity'd, and she lov'd him. PhÃ¦dra. She lov'd him!âYes, she saw, and she ador'd. Gods! who could see the graces of his youth, His cause, his innocence, the hero's mien, Manly and firm, yet soften'd by distress, Gods! who could see him, and not gaze entranc'd In ecstacy and love?âWhat have I said? My warmth too far transports meâah! beware (aside) 'Twas as you say; she pity'd, and she lov'd. Archon. She favour'd his escape: you fled together. To ev'ry neighb'ring isle you wing'd your flight. You visited each realm; with pray'rs and tears Wearied each court. All fear'd your father's pow'r. You came to Naxos; Periander's will By public edict had forbid your landing. You anchor'd in the bay; with olive branch Your orator came forth. Did not I thenâ PhÃ¦dra. You succour'd our distress: the tear of sympathy Stood in your eye; and you may boast your merit, You play'd it well, Sir, Archon. This ambiguous strain But ill requites the offices of friendship. For you I watch'd the temper of the king, His ebbs and flows of passion: in apt season You landed here. Thrice hath the waning moon Conceal'd her light, and thrice renew'd her orb, While you, meantime, have liv'd protected here. Each hour has seen your sister Ariadne Rise in her charms, and now with boundless sway She reigns supreme in Periander's heart. PhÃ¦dra. True, we have found protection from your king. Three months have pass'd; but in that time a statesman May change his mind. New views of interest, New plans of policy, fair seeming motives, May give new principles. Archon. It is my first, My best ambition to relieve the wretched. You wrong me, princess; you had best retire. PhÃ¦dra. No; Periander first shall hear my suit. Here will I wait his coming; on the earth Fall prostrate at his feet, implore his mercy, Cling round his knees, and never loose my hold, Till his heart melt, and save us from destruction. Enter Theseus. Theseus. What plaintive sorrow thro' the lonely palace Alarms my list'ning ear? PhÃ¦dra. That well-known voice Dispels my fears. O! Theseus, how my heart Bounds at thy lov'd approach! and yet this day Decides your doom. Archon can tell you all. This day resigns you to my father's pow'r. Here Periander has resolv'd to answer Th' ambassador of Crete. Theseus. Controul thy fears. Archon has serv'd me, and I thank him for it. All will be well; the king protects us still. Archon, the storm that threaten'd hideous ruin At length subsides. The angry blast recalls Its train of horrors. Through the sev'ring clouds Faint gleams of day disclose the face of things. The raging deep, that rose in mountain billows, Sinks to repose: The winds, the waves are hush'd. From yon high tow'r, that overhangs the bay, I view'd the ocean round. No sail appears, No vessel cleaves the deep, save one escap'd From the wild uproar of the warring winds, That with it's shatter'd masts, and lab'ring oars, Stems the rough tide, and enters now the harbour. PhÃ¦dra. Another sail! and enters now the harbour! From whence? Who and what are they? From what coast? Alas, from Crete! 'tis Minos sends; my father's wrath Pursues us still; another embassy Comes to demand us all. Theseus. Controul this wild alarm, And banish ev'ry fear. Archon. Perhaps some vessel Rich with the stores, which busy commerce sends From the adjacent isles, on Naxos' coast Now seeks a shelter from the roaring deep. I'll to the harbour. Theseus, be it thine To pour o'er PhÃ¦dra's woes the balm of comfort, And hush her cares to peace. From Crete, I trust, The messengers of woe no more will come, To urge their stern demand. [Exit. PhÃ¦dra, Theseus. PhÃ¦dra. Go, traitor, go; Pernicious vile dissembler! Theseus. Ah! forbear. PhÃ¦dra. He seems a friend, the surer to betray. Full well he knows that Ariadne's charms Have wak'd a flame in Periander's heart. To that alliance with a statesman's craft He stands a foe conceal'd: He dreads to see On Naxos' throne a queen from Minos sprung, And therefore plans our ruin. Theseus. Yet thy fancy, Still arm'd against itself, turns pale and trembles At shadowy forms. Were thy suspicions just, Wherefore reveal them? Why unguard thyself, And lay each secret open to your foe? With him, whose rankling malice works unseen, While smiles becalm his looks, 'twere best pretend Not to perceive the lurking treachery. Reproof but goads him, and new whets his passions, Till what was policy becomes revenge. Detected villany can ne'er forgive. PhÃ¦dra. And must I fall in silence? must we perish, Abandon'd by ourselves, tame, willing victims, Nor let the murd'rer hear one dying groan? Must I behold him with his treach'rous arts, A lurking foe, nor pour my curses on him, But poorly crouch, and thank him for the blow? Oh! love like mine, the love which you inspir'd, That each day rises still to higher ardour; Think'st thou that love like mine will calmly see thee Giv'n up a victim to my father's rage? Theseus. And think'st thou then that Archon is my foe? PhÃ¦dra. He is; I know him well; he means destruction. Th' ambassador of Crete will soon have audience. Archon concerted all. Oh! if my care Could counteract his dark, his fell designs, Then were I bless'd indeed. When first you landed A helpless victim on the Cretan shore, Full well you know, soft pity touch'd my heart, And soon, that tender pity chang'd to love. I wish'd to save you: Ariadne's fortune Gave her the clue that led you thro' the maze. Her zeal out-ran my speed, but not my love. And would my fate allow me now to save thee, Then by that tie ('tis all my sister's claim) I then should prove me worthy of thy love. Theseus. Deem me not, gen'rous PhÃ¦dra, deem me not Form'd of such common clay, so dead to beauty, As not to feel with transport at my heart Thy pow'rful charms. To Ariadne I owe my life. That boon demands respect, Demands my gratitude. But love must spring Spontaneous in the heart, its only source, Unmix'd with other motives than it's own, Unbrib'd, unbought, above all vulgar ties. PhÃ¦dra. And yet while ruinâ Theseus. Check this storm of passion, Nor think, with abject fear that Periander Will e'er resign us. Ariadne's charms Have touch'd his heart. His words, his looks proclaim it. In the soft tumult all his soul is lost. He dwells for ever on the lov'd idea, And with her beauty means to grace his throne. PhÃ¦dra. Archon abhors the union: To prevent it, His deep designsâ Theseus. Hear what I shall disclose, And treasure it in sacred silence seal'd. Last night admitted to a private audience, Wrapt in the friendly mantle of the darkâ Enter an Officer. Theseus. What wouldst thou? speak thy purpose. Officer. At the harbour That fronts the northern wave, a ship from Athens This moment is arriv'd. PhÃ¦dra. Relief from Athens! Officer. Your presence there by all is loudly call'd for. Theseus. Say to my friends, I will attend them straight. [Exit Officer. PhÃ¦dra. A ray of hope to gild the cloud of woe. Theseus. Now PhÃ¦dra, mark me. Let thy fears subside. Last night when ev'ry care was lull'd to rest, No eye to trace my steps, no conscious ear To catch the sound, then Periander granted A private conference: I unbosom'd to him, In confidence, the secrets of my heart. To Ariadne I resign'd all claim; Renounc'd each tender passion. Periander No longer view'd me with a rival's eye. He promis'd his protection. Ariadne Has pow'rful charms, and the King bears a heart To beauty not impassive. Joy and rapture Spoke in his eye, and purpled o'er his face. With vanity she'll hear a Monarch's sighs, Proud of her sway. A diadem will quench Her former flame, with glitt'ring splendor tempt her, And make the infidelity her own. PhÃ¦dra. But if she hears a sister dares dispute A heart like thineâ Theseus. Trust to my prudent caution. That dang'rous secret I have skreen'd with care. Here it lies buried. Periander thinks A former flame, kindled long since in Greece, Preys on my heart with slow consuming fires. But hark;âbeware;âthis way some hasty stepâ Enter Archon. Archon. The Greeks now issue on the shore. They bring Tidings from Athens, and from every tongue Your name resounds, and rings along the shore. Theseus. Thy friendship knows no pause; each hour you bring New succour to the wretched. Princess, farewell. Archon, I thank thee, and now seek my friends. [Exit. PhÃ¦dra, Archon. Princess, if once again I may presume To offer friendly counsel, from this place 'Twere best you now retire. Yon Eastern clouds Blush with the orient day. My royal master, Attentive ever to the cares of state, Will soon be here. PhÃ¦dra. Let him first hear my pray'r; Permit me here to see him. To the voice Of misery his ear will not be clos'd. [A flourish of trumpets: the back scene opens, and discovers a throne. Enter Periander, and attendant Officers. PhÃ¦dra. Oh! Periander, 'midst the nations fam'd For wisdom and for justice, let thy heart Incline to mercy. Spare, oh! spare the wretched. Periander. Rise, Princess, rise. That humble suppliant state Suits not the dignity of Minos' daughter. Whence this alarm, and why those gushing tears? PhÃ¦dra. We fled for refuge to you. Oh! protect, Protect the innocent. You gave us shelter; It was a godlike act; recall it not; Yield us not victims to a father's wrath, Nor by one barbarous action sully all The glories of your reign. Save Ariadne, Save Theseus too: our misery claims respect. Periander. Save Ariadne? can that beauteous mourner Suspect my promis'd faith? perhaps ev'n now, Like some frail flow'r by beating rains oppress'd, She pining droops, and sickens in despair: Oh! quickly seek her: with the words of comfort Heal all her woes; raise that afflicted fair, And bid the graces of her matchless form Flourish secure beneath my fost'ring smile. When Ariadne sues, a monarch's heart Yields to her tears with transport. PhÃ¦dra. Men will praise The gen'rous deed: the gods will bless thee for it. [Exit. Archon. The Ambassador from Crete with Minos' orders Attends your royal will. Periander. He shall be heard. [He ascends his Throne. Enter Aletes. Periander. To Naxos' court, Aletes, you are welcome. You come commission'd from the Cretan King: Now speak your embassy. Aletes. In fairest terms Of friendly greeting Minos, Sir, by me Imparts his rightful claim. He knows the justice, The moderation that directs your counsels: He knows, though oft' in the embattled field Your sword has reek'd with blood, your wisdom still Respects the rights of kings; respects the laws, That hold the nations in the bonds of peace. To you, Sir, he appeals; he claims his daughters, His rebel daughters, leagu'd against his crown: He claims the victim from his vengeance rescued; Rescued by fraud, by Ariadne's fraud; And here at Naxos shelter'd from his justice. A sov'reign and a parent claims his rights. You will respect the father and the king. Periander. Of Minos' virtues, his renown in arms, His plan of laws, that spread around the blessings Of sacred order, and of social life; Laws, which ev'n Kings obey, the world has heard With praise, with gratitude. All must revere The Legislator, and the friend of man. But in the sorrows that distract his house, Is it for me with rash mistaken zeal To interpose my care? is it for me To judge his daughters' conduct? What decree, What law of mine, what policy of Naxos Have they offended? All who roam the deep Find in my ports a safe, a sure retreat. Should I comply with your proud, bold request, The hardy genius of this sea-girt isle Will call it tyranny, and pow'r usurp'd. 'Tis law, and not the sov'reign's will, that here Controuls, directs, and animates the state. Aletes. The law that favours wrongs, and shelters guilt, Subverts all order. Through her hundred cities All Crete will mourn your answer. With regret Minos will hear it. By pacific means He would prevail; by justice, not the sword. But, Sir, if justice, if a righteous cause At your tribunal lift their voice in vain, I see the gath'ring storm; I see the dangers That hover round your isle, and o'er the scene Humanity lets fall the natural tear. The sons of Crete, a brave, a gen'rous race, Active and ardent in their monarch's cause Already grasp the sword. I see the ocean White with unnumber'd sails; your coast, your harbours Beleaguer'd close. I see the martial bands Planting their banners on the well-fought shore; Your hills, your plains glitt'ring with hostile arms, Your cities sack'd, your villages on fire, While from its source each river swoln with carnage Runs crimson to the main. I see the conqueror Urge to your capital with rapid march, And desolation cov'ring all the land. Still, Sir, you may prevent this waste of blood; Your timely wisdomâ Periander. The scope now appears Of your fair seeming message. And does Minos, Fam'd as he is in arms, say, does he hope With proud imperious sway to lord it o'er The princes of the world? And does he mean To write his laws in blood? And must the nations Crouch at his nod? Must I upon my throne Look pale and tremble, when your fancied Jove Grasps the uplifted thunder? Tell your king He knows my warlike name; knows we have met In fields of death, oppos'd in adverse ranks, Braving each other's lance; he knows the sinew, With which this arm can wield the deathful blade, Or send the missive javelin on the foe, Thirsting for blood.âGo, bear my answer back, And say besides, that Naxos boasts a race Rough as their clime, by liberty inspir'd, Of stubborn nerve, and unsubmitting spirit, Who laugh to scorn a foreign master's claim. You've spoke your embassy, and have our answer. Aletes. Unwilling I bear hence th' ungrateful tidings. [Exit. Periander, Archon. Periander. To-morrow's sun shall see him spread his sails: He must not linger here. Archon. Your pardon, Sir, This answer may provoke the powers of Crete, And war, inevitable war ensues. Periander. Let the invader come: here we have war To meet his bravest troops. Archon. But where the numbers To man each port, and line the sea-beat shore? Within the realm should the foe flush'd with conquest Rear his proud bannerâ Periander. With auxiliar aid Greece will espouse my cause. The fleets of Athens Full soon shall cover the ÃgÃ©an deep, And with confederated bands repel A tyrant's claim. Archon. Each state will urge its claim. Minos demands his daughter: Greece expects Her gallant warrior, and ev'n now asserts To crown his love, the princess as her own. Let Theseus spread his sails, and steer for Greece, With Ariadne, partner of his flight. You gain that gen'rous state: by ev'ry tie Of honour bound, Athens unsheaths her sword, And haughty Minos threatens here in vain. Periander. Yield Ariadne! yield that matchless beauty, Where all the loves, where all the graces dwell! No, I will save her; will protect her here From rude, unhallow'd violence. Do thou Haste to the palace, where the princess dwells; Say to th' attendant train, ourself will come, To tell the counsels which my heart has form'd. Archon. Ay, there it lies, there lurks the secret wound. Love strikes the sweet infection to his soul. 'Tis as I fear'd (aside)âPerhaps by mild remonstrance We may gain time, and by the specious arts Of treaty and debate prevent the war. Periander. You know my orders; see them straight obeyed. [Exit Archon. Periander alone. Yes, Ariadne, from the inclement storms Of thy rude fortune, it is fix'd to shield thee, And soften all thy woes. Her father then, When with her milder ray returning reason Becalms his breast, shall thank the friend that held His rage suspended, and with joy shall hear That Ariadne reigns the queen of Naxos; Here rules with gentle sway a willing people, And with her virtues dignifies my throne. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the SECOND. Scene, a magnificent Apartment in a Palace. Enter Periander, with Attendants. Let all with duty, with observance meet Wait on the princess: let the virgin train With songs of rapture, and melodious airs Try their best art; wake all the magic pow'r Of harmony, to soothe that tender breast, And with soft numbers lull each sense of pain. I have beheld her, gaz'd on ev'ry charm, And Ariadne triumphs in my heart. Enter Archon. A messenger from Athens waits your pleasure. Periander. From Athens say'st thou? Archon. In the northern bay His ship is moor'd. Theseus attends the stranger, And both now crave an audience. Periander. In apt time Their messenger arrives: when war impends, Tidings from Athens are right welcome to me: They breathe new vigour. Let the Greek approach. Enter Theseus, and Pirithous. Theseus. Forgive the transports of a heart that swells Above all bounds, when I behold my friend, My gallant, gen'rous friend, the brave Pirithous! It glads my soul, thus to present before you A chief renown'd in arms, the best of men, My other self, the partner of my toils, And my best guide to glory. Periander. To the virtues Of the brave chief my ear is not a stranger. You come from Athens? Pirithous. Scarce two days have pass'd Since thence I parted. Thro' the realms of Greece Fame spread at large th' adventures of my friend, With Ariadne's glory, and the deed, The gen'rous deed that snatch'd him from destruction. How she convey'd him to this happy shore, How he has been receiv'd, and shelter'd here, The men of Athens, sensibly alive To each fine motive, each exalted purpose, Have heard with gratitude. My feeble voice Would but degrade the sentiments that burn In ev'ry breast, with joy and rapture fir'd. Warm with the best sensations of the heart, They pour their thanks, the tribute of their praise. Periander. The praise that's offer'd by the sons of Greece, By that heroic, that enlighten'd race, Is the best meed fair virtue can receive. Pirithous. That fair reward is yours: your worth demands it. To my brave friend Athens next points her care. What crime is his? Did he imbrue his hands In young Androgeus' blood? Why should he fall To expiate the death of Minos' son? Against the innocent who makes reprisals, And on the blameless head lets fall the sword, Offers up victims to his fell revenge. 'Tis murder, and not justice. Periander. Righteous heav'n In th' hour of danger has watch'd o'er your friend, And he has triumph'd o'er their barb'rous rites, Their savage law, the stain of Minos' reign. Pirithous. Athens, exulting, pants for his return. In crowds her eager citizens go forth, And on the beach, and on the wave-worn cliff, O'er all the main rowl their desiring eyes, And ask of ev'ry ship that ploughs the deep, News of their hero. A whole people's voice Chose me their delegate, their faithful officer, To seek my friend, and bear him hence with speed Back to his native land. Periander. The laws of Naxos To all are equal. None are here constrain'd, None forc'd by violence, or lawless pow'r, To quit this safe, this hospitable shore. Theseus will use the rights of free-born men. 'Tis his to give the answer. Theseus. For this goodness My heart o'erflows with more than words can speak. Pirithous. All Greece will thank you.âAriadne tooâ Periander. How? Ariadne say'st thou?â Pirithous. With delight, With admiration, with unbounded transport, Athens has heard her gen'rous exploits; Has heard, when Theseus on the Cretan shore Arriv'd to glut their vengeance, how the tear Bedew'd her cheek. She pitied his misfortunes, And whom she snatch'd from death, she means to bless With that rare beauty, and connubial love. Periander. Ha! do'st thou come to sink me to a slave? 'Tis pride, 'tis arrogance makes this demand. Must I obey the proud, imperious mandate? Bear Ariadne with you!âBy yon heav'n, No pow'r on earth shall force her from the isle. If thou presum'st againâ Pirithous. I never have, I never can presumeâ Periander. 'Tis insolence! Is this the praise? Are these the thanks you bring? Urge that request no more.â Pirithous. If to my words You'll deign to lend a favourable earâ Periander. Say on what law does Athens found a right To claim an alien princess? Pirithous. When her choice, Her gen'rous choice, the impulse of the heart Inclines her will, you will not fetter freedom? Periander. Her father claims her: dost thou vainly hope, That Greece can silence his paternal rights? Is that your errand? Who commission'd thee? Is Theseus your adviser? and does he Second this proud attempt? Theseus. No, Theseus never Will plan, or counsel what may stain your honour. Pirithous. Nor will he e'er forget,âI know him wellâ I know his gratitude, his gen'rous warmth, His constancy and truthâHe'll ne'er forget His vows of faithful love. The debt he owes To Ariadne never can be paid. Athens approves their union: tuneful bards Prepare the tribute of immortal verse, And white-rob'd virgins ev'n now are ready, Where e'er she treads, to scatter at her feet The blooming spring, and at the sacred altar To hymn the bridal song. Theseus. Unthinking man! This blind mistaken zeal will ruin all. (aside.) Periander. No more; I'll hear no more; here break we off. Proud Greek forbear, nor wound again my ear With terms of vile disgrace. Another word Of yielding Ariadne, and by Heav'n The claims of MinosâHis ambassador Is here at hand; once more I'll give him audience. And if again this outrage to my crown,â If Theseus is found tamp'ring in your plot,â If you (to Theseus) presume by subtlety and fraud To mock my hopes, and after last night's conference, Renounce your honour, my resentment rous'd May do a deed to whelm you all in ruin. Then, let your friend, when next he dares approach us, Learn to respect a monarch, who disdains A proud demand from the vain states of Greece. [Exit. Theseus, Pirithous. Pirithous. The states of Greece, proud monarch! be assur'd, Will vindicate their rights. Ha!âwhy that look Of wild dismay? that countenance of sorrow? Explain; what means my friend? Theseus. Alas! you know not, You little know the horror and despair In which the hand of fate has plung'd my soul. Pirithous. And can despair oppress thee? can thy heart Know that pale inmate? By our dangers past, By all our wars, spite of this braggart king, The beauteous Ariadne shall be thine. Theseus. No more; no more of that:âI cannot speakâ Pirithous. Those falt'ring accents, and those lab'ring sighs Import some strange alarm. Theseus. Oh! lead me hence, To meet the fiercest monsters of the desert, Rather than bear this conflict of the mind. Pirithous. Unfold this mystery:âThose downcast eyesâ Theseus. You have awaken'd Periander's fury. Thy words have led me to a precipice, And I stand trembling on the giddy brink. Pirithous. From thence I'll lead thee to the peaceful vale, To life and happiness.âAnd can you thus, When all your country's wishes bless your name, When Athens to promote your happinessâ Theseus. They may mis-judge my happiness:âAlas! I thank them: little do they know of Theseus. Pirithous. They know your virtues, your heroic ardour, Your patriot toil in the great cause of Greece: They know that honour in your breast has fix'd His sacred shrine: They know the gen'rous flame That love has wak'd in Ariadne's breast, And how, in gratitude, the bright idea Must fire a soul like thine. Theseus. Too deep, too deep Each accent pierces here. (aside) Pirithous. Those faithful arms Shall soon receive her. Theseus. You should not have claim'd her. Pirithous. Not claim that excellence! that rarest beautyâ Theseus. By that mistaken claim you've rais'd a storm That soon may burst in ruin on my head. You've fir'd to madness Periander's soul, And wounded me, here, in the tend'rest nerve, That twines about the heart. For Ariadne Thy suit is vain, 'tis fruitless: urge no more. Let me embark for Greece; gain my dismission; But for the princess, name her not: her liberty The heart of Periander ne'er will grant: No words, that art e'er form'd, will wring it from him. Pirithous. Not grant her freedom! not release her hence! Should he refuse, all Greece will rise in arms: One common cause will form the gen'rous league. Soon Periander shall behold the ocean White with the foam of twenty-thousand ships; The Grecian phalanx posted on his hills, And his defenceless island wrapt in flames. Theseus. Let Greece forget me, nor in such a cause Unchain the fury of wide-wasting war. Oh! not for me such slaughter. Pirithous. Think'st thou Greece Will see thee torn from Ariadne's arms? From her, who sacrific'd her all for thee? From her, whose courage has brav'd ev'ry danger; Fled from her country, from her father's court, To save her hero's life? From her, whose beauty Already is the praise of wond'ring Greece, Surpassing all that lavish fancy forms. I know the princess; the revolving year Has not yet clos'd its round, since I beheld her The pride, the glory of the Cretan dames. That harmony of shape, that winning grace; And when she moves, that dignity of mien! Those eyes, whose quick and inexpressive glance Brightens each feature, while it speaks the soul. Theseus. Thou need'st not, oh! my friend, thou need'st not point Her beauties to my heart.âEach charm is her's, Softness and dignity in union sweet, And each exalted virtue. Nature form'd her The hero's wonder, and the poet's theme. Pirithous. You shall not lose her, by yon Heav'n you shall not. I'll seek the king; apprise him of his danger; Unmoor my ship, remeasure back the deep, And bring the fleets of Athens to his harbour. Theseus. It must not be; no, Periander's soul Is firm, heroic, unsubdu'd by danger. His sudden rage, his irritated pride Will seal my doom: The deputies from Crete Are here to claim their victim: Periander sees Each charm, each grace of Ariadne's form, And sends his rival hence to instant death. Pirithous. I can prevent him; can elude his malice. This very night, when all is wrapt in darkness, Embark with me. The partner of your heart Shall be our lovely freight. I'll bear her hence Far from the tyrant's pow'r. I'll lead you both To Athen's happy realm, the growing school Of laurell'd science, and each lib'ral art, Of laws, and polish'd life, where both may shine The pride, the lustre of a wond'ring world, Dear to each other, and to after-times The pattern of all truth and faithful love. Theseus. Wretch that I am!âhis ev'ry word presents My inward self, the horrors of my guilt. (aside.) Pirithous. Theseus,âthat alter'd look,âthose sighs renew'd! Some hoarded grief,â Theseus. Enquire no more, but leave me. Pirithous. I cannot, will not leave thee: tell me all. Some load of secret grief weighs on thy spirit. Theseus. There let it lodge, there swell, and burst my heart. Pirithous. You terrify your friend: Why heaves that groan? Why those round drops, just starting from thy eye, Which manhood combating forbids to fall? Theseus. I see my guilt. Pirithous. Your guilt? Theseus. I feel it all. Pirithous. If there is ought that labours in thy breastâ Theseus. Here, here it lies. Pirithous. To me unbosom all. Theseus. Pirithous, wouldst thou think it?âOh! my friend, I owe to Ariadne more,âalas! much more Than a whole life of gratitude can pay. And yetâ Pirithous Go on: unload thy inmost thoughts; A friend may heal the wound. Theseus. Oh! no; thou'lt scorn me, Abjure, detest, abhor me.âWilt thou pardon The frailties of a heart, that drives me on, Endears the crime, and yet upbraids me still? In me thou see'stâwho can controul his love? In me thou seestâ Pirithous. Speak; what? Theseus. A perjur'd villain! The veriest traitor, that e'er yet deceiv'd A kind, a generous, a deluded maid, And for his life preserv'd, for boundless love, Can only answer with dissembling looks, With counterfeited smiles, with fruitless thanks; While with resistless charms another beautyâ Pirithous. Another!âgracious pow'rs! Theseus. She kindles all The passions of my soul; charms ev'ry sense, And PhÃ¦dra reigns the sov'reign of my heart. Pirithous. Her sister PhÃ¦dra!âand does she aspire To guilty joys? Does she admit your love? Does she too join you in the impious league? Will she thus wound a sister, and receive A traitor, a deserter to her arms? Theseus. On me, on me let fall thy bitt'rest censure, But blame her not. Pirithous. Not blame her!âWho can hear A tale like this, and not condemn you both? Th' ungen'rous act will tarnish all your fame. Theseus. Forbear, my friend; the god of love inspir'dâ Pirithous. Some fiend, a foe to ev'ry gen'rous instinct, A foe to all that's fair, or great in man, Infus'd the baleful poison through your soul. Theseus. The guilt is mine: But spare, oh! spare my PhÃ¦dra. A single glance from those love-beaming eyes Inflames each thought, and hurries me to madness. Hark! (soft musick is heard) Ariadne comes!âthis way, my friend; Thou still canst serve me. With a lover's ardour The king beholds her, and with earnest suit He woes her to his throne. Let us retire; Thou still canst guide me through the maze of fate. [Exeunt. The back Scene opens, and soft Musick is heard. Enter Ariadne, with a train of Virgins. First Virgin. Now, Ariadne, now, my royal mistress, Propitious fortune smiles, and from this day The gods prepare a smiling train of years. Ariadne. I thank you, Virgins; this kind sympathy Shews you have hearts that feel another's bliss. Oh! much I thank you, virgins; yes this day Dispels the clouds, that hover'd o'er my head. Thou source of life, thou bright, thou radiant god, Who through creation pour'st thy flood of glory, All hail thy golden orb! Thou com'st to quell The howling blast, to bid the tempest ceafe, And after all the horrors of the night, To cheer the face of nature!âOh! to me Thou com'st propitious, in thy bright career Leading thy festive train. The circling hours That smile with happier omens, as they pass Shedding down blessings from their balmy wings, Prepare thy way rejoicing: with thee come Bright Hope, and rose-lip'd Health, and pure delight, And love and joy, the sunshine of the soul. First Virgin. Be all your hours like this: may no misfortune O'ercloud the scene; and may you ne'er have cause To dim the lustre of those eyes in tears. Ariadne. No, from this day, from this auspicious day, Theseus is mine; the godlike hero's mine, With ev'ry grace, with ev'ry laurel crown'd, The lover's softness, and the warrior's fire. A monarch now protects him; he has pledg'd His royal word.âBut wherefore tarries Theseus? Swift as some god, that mounts the viewless winds, And cleaves the liquid air, he should have flown To tell me all, to bless me with his presence, And bid the news more joyful touch my ear, Rais'd and endear'd by that enchanting tongue. Why does he loiter thus? First Virgin. His friends from Greece Perhaps detain him. Ariadne. Oh! it must be so, And without cause I chide his ling'ring stay. A ship from Greece to claim us! mighty gods! When your displeasure smote me, when your wrath, Severely just, gave to my trembling lip The cup of bitterness, to your high will I bow'd in reverence down; I bore it all, For Theseus' sake, I bore it all with patience; And 'midst our sorrows, with a dawn of gladness I sooth'd his wounded spirit; teach me now, Oh! teach me how to bear this tide of joy, Nor with excess of bounty try too much A heart that melts, that languishes with love. Enter PhÃ¦dra. Ariadne. Oh! PhÃ¦dra, why this long, unkind delay? The gods restore my Theseus to my arms. PhÃ¦dra. If the protecting gods from Theseus' head Ward off th' impending blow, none more than PhÃ¦dra Will feel the gen'ral joy. But still my fearsâ Ariadne. Suppress them all. Theseus has nought to fear. But where, where is he? whither has he wander'd? Say, tell me all, and speak to me of Theseus? In vain I ask it. Though his name delight My list'ning ear, yet you will never charm me With the lov'd praises of the godlike man. On Periander's name you often dwell, In strains, that in a heart not touch'd like mine, Might stir affection.âNot a word of Theseus. Why silent thus?âit is unkind reserve. Alas, my sister, thy unruffled temper Knows not the tender luxury of love, That joys to hear the object it adores Approv'd, admir'd of all: when ev'ry tongue Grows lavish in his praise, then, then, with ecstacy The heart runs over, and with pride we listen. PhÃ¦dra. I have been just to Theseus; never wrong'd him. His fame in arms has fill'd the nations round; And purple victory in fields of death For him has often turn'd the doubtful scale. Ariadne. Unkind, ungen'rous praise! Has no one told you His brave exploits? the number of his battles? But who can count them? Fame exalts her trump, Delighted with his name to swell the note; And Victory exulting claps her wings, Still proud to follow, where he leads the way. PhÃ¦dra. So fame reports.âWith what unbounded rage Her passions kindle.âShe alarms my fears. (aside.) Ariadne. Why that averted look? Of late, my sister, Of late I've mark'd thee with dejected mien, Pensive and sad.âIf aught of discontent Weighs on thy heart, disclose it all to me. In ev'ry state of life, in all conditions, With thee I have unloaded ev'ry secret, Fled to your arms, and sigh'd forth all my care. PhÃ¦dra. Does Ariadne think my love abated? Ariadne. No, PhÃ¦dra, no; I harbour no mistrust. I know thy virtues:âWe grew up together, Knit in the bands of love. No op'ning grace That sparkled in thy eye, or dawn'd in mine, Could prompt the little passions of our sex. We heard each other's praise, and envy slept. And sure had Theseus, though with boundless ardour I now must love him, to districtaon love him, Yet if my Theseus had first fix'd on thee, I could (I think I could) have seen you happy In his loved arms, and hero as he is I had resign'd him to you.âWhy that sigh, PhÃ¦dra?âwhy fall those tears? PhÃ¦dra. Forgive your sister, If still she fears for theeâHer ev'ry look, Each word she utters pierces to my heart. (aside.) Ariadne. Speak, tell me why is this? why thus alarm me? I never had a thought conceal'd from thee. Enter Theseus, and Pirithous. Ariadne. Oh! Theseus, in thy absence ev'ry moment Was counted with a sigh. Support me, help me; For I am faint with bliss. Theseus. Revive, revive; Recall thy fleeting strength. Your counsels, PhÃ¦dra, Will best assist her; your persuasive voice Will charm her sense, and banish all her cares. PhÃ¦dra. At his lov'd sight, what new emotions rise! (aside.) Theseus. My friend Pirithous from the realms of Greeceâ Ariadne. Pirithous here! the messenger from Athens! When last you sojourn'd at my father's court; (The sun has circled since his annual round) I well remember you admir'd of all. Men heard and praised the wonder of your friendship For Theseus, then a stranger to these eyes, But since beheld, and ah! beheld to charm The heart of Ariadne!âyou come now To succour our distress. Pirithous. In evil hour I sail'd from Greece. Would I had ne'er embark'd. Ariadne. My heart dies in me.âSay what new eventâ Theseus explain, and tell me, tell me all. Theseus. Oh! I was born to be th' unceasing curse Of Ariadne's life; still, still indebted, Unable to repay. Ariadne. Thou generous man! To hear those sounds, and view thee thus before me, Oe'r pays me now for all my sufferings past. Enter Archon. Archon. Theseus, on matters of some new concern, To me unknown, your presence is required. 'Tis Periander's order. Theseus. I obey. Ariadne. What may this mean? yet, Theseus, ere you goâ Theseus. My friend will tell each circumstance; from him You'll calmly hear it all. And may his voice, Soft as the breeze that pants in eastern groves, Approach your ear, and sooth your thoughts to peace. [Exit with Archon. Ariadne. The gods will watch thy ways, and Periander Has promis'd still to shield thy suffering virtue. PhÃ¦dra. I dread some mischief: Ariadne, here Wait my return: I'll follow to the palace, And bring the earliest tidings of his fate. [Exit. Ariadne, Pirithous. Ariadne. My heart is chill'd with fear. What dark eventâ Can Perianderâno; dishonour never Will stain his name.âAnd yet that awful pause! Those looks with grief o'erwhelm'd!â Pirithous. Yes, grief indeed Sits heavy at my heart.â Ariadne. Reveal the cause; Give me to know the worst. This dread suspenceâ Pirithous. Oh! that in silence I could ever hide From you, from all, and in oblivion bury What here is lodg'd, and shakes my soul with horror! Ariadne. With horror! wherefore? is not Theseus safe? Does not his country claim him? Does not Greece With open arms expect him? Does not Athens Send you with orders to demand us both? Pirithous. From thence your dangers rise: the sons of Athens, A quick, inconstant, fluctuating raceâ Ariadne. Yet ever wise, heroic, gen'rous, brave, All soul, all energy. Do they oppose Our nuptial union? Do they still maintain Their old hostility? Do they exclude An alien princess from the throne of Athens? If such their will, take, take the sov'reign sway, Th' imperial diadem, the pomp of state: Let Theseus to his father's rights succeed, And reign alone; make me his wedded wife; 'Tis all I ask; the gods can grant no more. Thrones, sceptres, grandeur! love can scorn you all. Pirithous. Unhappy Theseus! by disastrous fate Doom'd to betray such excellence; to see The fairest gift of Heav'n, and spurn it from him. (aside.) Ariadne. You answer not: speak and resolve my doubts. Pity a heart, too tenderly alive, And wild with fear, that throbs, that aches like mine. Thy pure, exalted mind will tow'r above The arts of mean equivocating phrase. You'll not deceive a fond, a faithful woman. Pirithous. None should deceive you; none. You will forgive My hesitating fears. I would not wound That tender frame with aught that may alarm you. For thee my mind misgives: the fear that awes me Pays homage to your virtue. Ariadne. And does Greece Reject the love I proffer? Pirithous. No, all Greece Reveres your honour'd name: Th' Athenian state By me demands your liberty. In terms Of earnest import I have urg'd their claim; But Periander,âto his ardent spirit You are no stranger.âHe no sooner heard The name of Ariadne, than with fiercest rageâ Perhaps you know the causeâwith high disdain He spurn'd at the demand. Some hidden motiveâ 'Tis love perhapsâyou will forgive my boldnessâ 'Tis love, perhaps, that prompts the stern reply. Should I presume once more to urge the claim, Theseus that moment must embark for Crete. So says the king: he will not brook a rival. You'll see your lover torn by ruffians from you; You'll see the ship bound swiftly o'er the waves; In vain you'll shriek; in vain extend your arms, And call on Theseus lost! Ariadne. That savage purpose The soul of Periander will disdain. Pirithous. What will not love persuade? love made you fly Your father's court; and love may teach a monarch To break all bonds, and tow'r above the laws. Ariadne. If this be what alarms youâ Pirithous. Theseus' life Once more depends on thee.â Ariadne. To save that life Is there an enterprize, a scene of danger, That Ariadne will not dare to meet? Pirithous. Your wond'rous daring on the wings of fame Has reach'd the nations round. But now, alas! One only way is left. Ariadne. Direct me to it. Pirithous. To Periander lend a gracious ear. For thee he sighs; for thee his vows ascend. His throne awaits thee; the imperial crownâ Ariadne. Sir, do you know me? Pirithous. Princess, here to reign In this fair islandâ Ariadne. Do you know the spirit That rules this breast, and o'er informs my soul? Pirithous. Forgive the zeal that prompts me to this office. The king intensely loves; and in a base, Degen'rate world, from which all truth is fled, He still may faithful prove to worth like thine. Consult with Theseus: he can best advise you. Ariadne. Consult with Theseus! ask his kind consent That I may prove a traitress to my vows! Sir, for this counsel, for this gen'rous care, Accept my thanks.âYou are too much alarm'd. Resign my Theseus! Oh! the gods have form'd him With ev'ry virtue that adorn's the hero; With valour, to incite the soldiers' wonder; With ev'ry grace to charm the heart of woman. Oh! none will rival him. 'Twill be the pride Of Periander, 'tis his highest glory, That Theseus fled for shelter to his throne, And met protection here. Pirithous. I've been to blame. Perhaps I urge too far: Princess, farewell! May the benignant gods watch all your ways. [Exit. Ariadne. Your fears are vain; each gloomy cloud shall vanish, Or, ting'd with orient beams of smiling fortune, With added lustre gild our various day; While o'er our heads Hymen shall wave his torch, Sooth all our cares, and brighten ev'ry joy. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the THIRD. Ariadne, Theseus. Ariadne. Oh! look not thus; those eyes that glare so pale, Those sighs that heave, as they would burst your heart, Affright my soul, and kill me with despair. Oh! banish all thy doubts, and let those eyes Smile, as when first they beam'd their softness on me. Theseus. Alas! I'm doom'd to mourn; my thread of life Was steep'd in tears, and must for ever run Black and discolour'd with the worst of woes. Ariadne. Can thy great heart thus shrink, appall'd with fear? Theseus, I never saw thee thus before. Theseus. Our days of rapture and of promis'd joy Far hence are fled. Ariadne. No, on their rosy wings The hours of joy and ever new delight Come smiling on. Is this a time for fear, When all is gay serenity around us, And Fortune opens all her brightest scenes? Theseus. Too soon that scene, with low'ring clouds deform'd, Will shew the sad reverse. You little know How Periander with resistless fury Breaks thro' all bounds. His passions scorn restraint, And what he wills, his vehemence of soul Pursues with fierce, with unremitting ardour. To his wild fury all must yield obedience. Ariadne. His reign has ever been both mild and just. Fair virtue, like some god that rules the storm, Still calms the warring elements within him; And moderation with her golden curb Guides all his actions. Theseus. Yet there is an impulse, Which with the whirlwind's unresisted rage, Roots up each virtue, and lays waste the soul. Love reigns a lawless tyrant in his heart. For thee he sighs; and sure that matchless beauty May well inflame the passions of a prince, Who with a diadem can deck thy brow. Ariadne. Too well he knows the ties that bind us both. Knows you're all truth, all constancy and love. He knows the flame my virgin sighs have own'd; Knows that for thee I left my native land, Fled from my friends, and from my father's palace, And gave up all for thee. And thinks he now His throne, his diadem, his purple pomp, Have charms of pow'r to lure me from thy arms? He knows his vows are lost in air: Thy heart Is Ariadne's throne. Theseus. His fiercest passions Break forth at once, like the deep cavern'd fire, All ties, all tender motives must give way. His resolution's fix'd. This very day, Unless for ever I renounce thy love, His jealous rage sends me hence bound in chains, To die a victim on the Cretan shore. Ariadne. He will not dare it; no, so black an outrage His heart will ne'er conceive. Should he persist, Should malice goad him on, I too can fly This barb'rous shore; with unextinguish'd love Thro' ev'ry region, ev'ry clime attend thee; Follow your fortunes, if the fates ordain it, Ev'n to my father's court; there prostrate fall, And clasp his hand, and bathe it with my tears, Nor cease with vehemence of grief to melt him, Till he release thee to these circling arms, Approve my choice, and shew thee to the people, The adopted heir, the rising sun of Crete. Theseus. By yielding me, his rival is destroy'd; And by that act his proud ambition hopes To sooth your father's irritated pride, And mould him to his wish. Ariadne. Can Periander Harbour that black intent? and does he mean To prove at first a villain and a murderer, And then aspire to Ariadne's love? No, Theseus, no: he will not stoop so vilely: I've heard you oft commend him; oft my sister Employs whole hours with rapture in his praise. He is her constant theme. Her partial voice Ev'n above thine exalts his fav'rite name. She dwells on each particular; in peace His milder virtues, his great fame in arms: How, when he talks, fond admiration listens: And each bright princess hears him, and adores. Theseus. Not envy's self, howe'er his pride inflam'd May deal with me, can overshade his glory. Renown in war is his; the softer virtues Of mild humanity adorn his name. The polish'd arts of peace, and ev'ry muse Attune to finer sentiments his soul. His throne is fix'd upon the firmest basis Of wisdom, and of justice. There to shine The partner of his heart, his soft associate In that bright scene of glory, well may prompt In ev'ry neighb'ring state the virgin's sigh, And wake th' ambition of each monarch's daughter. Ariadne. The strain, the rapture that to me in secret My sister PhÃ¦dra pours the live-long day, Enamour'd of his name! Perchance you've heard her, And mark'd the heaving sigh, and seen the blush That glow'd with conscious crimson on her cheek. Oh! if she cherishes the tender flame, With maiden coyness veil'd, and pines in love, Beauty like her's may fire a monarch's heart, And Periander, without shame or guilt, Without a crime, may woe her to his arms. To see her happy, to behold my PhÃ¦dra Crown'd with a monarch's and a people's love, Would be the pride of Ariadne's heart. Theseus. Oh! it were misery, the worst of woes. (aside). Ariadne. Why do you start? why that averted look? If you approve their nuptials, freely tell me: With Periander I can plead her cause, Paint forth each charm of that accomplish'd mind, 'Till the king glow with rapture at the sound. Theseus. Oh! this would plunge me in the worst despair. (aside) It must not be.âHas not Pirithous told youâ Ariadne. Pirithous is your friend.âPerhaps to draw The tie still closer, you would see him bless'd In PhÃ¦dra's arms.âTell me your inmost thoughts. If such your will, what will I not attempt To sooth to dear delight a mind like thine? PhÃ¦dra will listen to me; mutual love Has so endear'd us, from our tend'rest years Has so encreas'd, and with our growth kept pace, That we have had one wish, one heart, one mind. My voice with PhÃ¦dra will have all the pow'r Of soft persuasion: her exalted merit Will bless your friend and brighten all his days. Theseus. Oh! the bare image fires my brain to madness. (aside.) Alas! this dream of happinessâ Ariadne. What means That sudden cloud? and why that lab'ring sigh? Oh! let my sister to Pirithous' vows Yield her consent, and bless him with her beauty: Together we will seek the realms of Greece; There in sweet union see our growing loves Spring with new rapture, share each other's bliss, And by imparting multiply our joys. Enter Archon. Archon. With thee, fair princess, Periander craves Another interview: He enters now The palace garden. Ariadne. Does he there require My presence? Archon. Where you deign to give him audience, He will attend you. Theseus. It were best go forth. His virtues claim respect; and oh! remember My fate, my happiness on thee depend. Ariadne. Trust Ariadne, trust your fate with me. [Exit. Theseus, Archon. Archon. The Cretan princess with resistless passion Inflames his fierce desires. My boding fears Foresee some dire event. Theseus. A glance from her Will sooth his rage, and all may still be well. When love resistless fires the noble mind, Th' effects, though sudden, from that gen'rous source, Are oft excus'd; the errors of our nature, The tender weakness of the human heart. Archon. Errors that influence the public weal, His rank prohibits.âLet his vices be, (If vices he must have) obscure and private, Unfelt by men, leaving no trace behind. It were unjust, that his unbounded fury Should tear thee from the arms of her you love. Theseus. But when a monarchâHa! Pirithous comes. Enter Pirithous. Pirithous. Theseus, I sought thee.âArchon, does your king Relent? or must confed'rate Greece send forth Her fleets and armies to support her rights? Archon. The miseries of war my feeble voice Shall labour to prevent. Theseus, farewell. Archon is still your friend. With Ariadne, Ere long, I trust, you may revisit Greece. [Exit. Theseus, Pirithous. Theseus. With her revisit Greece! Why all this zeal For Ariadne? Who has tamper'd with him? Why not convey her to her father's court? Why not invite her to the throne of Naxos? Why all this busy, this officious care To torture me? to foil his sov'reign's love? To send far hence the idol of his heart, And blend her fate with mine? Pirithous. Her fate with thine So close is blended, nothing can divide them. Truth, honour, justice, gratitude combine Each tender sentiment; they form a chain, An adamantine chain, indissoluble, firm, And strong as that which from the throne of Jove Hangs down to draw to harmony and union This universal frame. Theseus. Is this my friend? Pirithous. Your friend, who scorns to flatter; Who dares avow th' emotions of his heart. Oh! Theseus, we have long together walk'd The paths of virtue, upright, firm in honour; And shall we now decline? and shall we now With fraud, with perfidy, with blackest perfidy, For ever damn our names? Theseus. This stern reproof Is not the language the time now demands. 'Tis thine, my friend, to soften my distress; To pour the balm of comfort o'er my sorrows, And soothe the anguish of a wounded mind. Oh! step between me and the keen reproaches Of injur'd beauty; save me from myself; From Ariadne save me. Pirithous. Is it thus, Oh! rash deluded man! and is it thus With high disdain you spurn that rarest beauty, That fond, believing, unsuspecting fair? Theseus. Have you not painted to her dazzled fancy The splendor of a throne, that here awaits her? Pirithous. So gen'rous, so unbounded is her love, She seeks but thee, thee only. Pomp and splendor Are toys that sink, and fade away before her. Theseus. Then tell her all the truth: tell her at once, Another flame is kindled in my heart, And fate ordains she never can be mine. Pirithous. Will that become Pirithous? that the task Thy friendship would impose? Must I proclaim To th' astonish'd world, my friend's dishonour? Must I with cruelty, with felon purpose, Approach that excellence, that beauteous form, And for her gen'rous love, for all her virtue, Fix in her tender breast the sharpest pang, With which ingratitude can stab the heart? Theseus. Why wilt thou goad me thus? 'tis cruelty; 'Tis malice in disguise.âForbear, forbear; Assist your friend in the soft cause of love, Involuntary love, that hold's enslav'd The fetter'd will. Pirithous. Involuntary love! Beware, beware of the deceitful garb That vice too oft assumes.âThere's not a purpose Prompting to evil deeds, that dares appear In it's own native form. The first approach With bland allurements, with insidious mien, Wears the delusive semblance of some virtue. The Siren spreads her charms, and Fancy lends Her thousand hues to deck the lurking crime. Opinion changes; 'tis no longer guilt; 'Tis amiable weakness, gen'rous frailty, Involuntary error. On we rush By fatal error led, and thus the language, The sophistry of vice deludes us all. Theseus. Pirithous, 'tis in vain: in vain you strive, By subtle maxims, and by pedant reas'ning To talk down love, and mould it to your will. It rages here like a close pent-up fire. And think'st thou tame advice can check its course, And soothe to rest the fever of the soul? Pirithous. And wilt thou thus, by one ungen'rous deed, Blast all your laurels, and give up at once To shame and infamy thy honour'd name? Theseus. Wouldst thou destroy my peace of mind for ever? Pirithous. I would preserve it. Wouldst thou still enjoy Th' attesting suffrage of the conscious heart? The road is plain and level: live with honour. Be all your deeds, such as become a man. 'Tis that alone can give th' unclouded spirit, The pure serenity of inward peace. All else is noisy fame; the giddy shout Of gazing multitudes, that soon expires, And leaves our laurels, and our martial glory To wither and decay. By after times The roar of fond applause no more is heard. The triumph ceases, and the hero then Fades to the eye: the faithless man remains. Theseus. Was it for this you spread your sails from Greece? To aggravate my sorrows?âIf a monarch Woos Ariadne to his throne and bed; If I resign her to imperial splendor, Where is my guilt? Why will she not accept The bright reward, that waits to crown her virtues? Pirithous. Because, like thee, she is not prone to change. Theseus. Why, cruel, why thus pierce my very soul? Pirithous. Because, like thee, she knows not to betray. Theseus. Disastrous fate. And wouldst thou have me fly From PhÃ¦dra's arms? By every solemn vow, By every sacred tie, by love itself, My heart is her's. She is my only source Of present bliss, my best, my only earnest Of future joy; the idol of my soul. Should I desert her, can invention find, 'Midst all her stores, a tint of specious colouring To varnish the deceit? Pirithous. It wants no varnish, No specious colouring. Plain honest truth Will justify the deed. With open firmness Go, talk with PhÃ¦dra: tell her with remorse Conscience has shewn the horrors of your guilt. Tell her the vows, you breathed to Ariadne, Were heard above, recorded by the gods. Tell her, if still she spreads her fatal lure, She takes a perjur'd traitor to her arms, Practis'd in fraud, who may again deceive. Tell her, with equal guilt, nor less abhor'd, She joins to rob a sister of her rights. Tell her that Greeceâ Theseus. No more; I'll hear no more. Assist my love; 'tis there I ask your aid. Forget my fame; it is not worth my care. Pirithous. Then, go, rush on, devoted to destruction. Let Hymen kindle his unhallow'd torch, Clasp'd in each others arms enjoy your guilt. Renounce all sacred honour; add your name To the bright list of those illustrious worthies, Who have seduc'd, by vile insidious arts, The fond affections of the gen'rous fair; And in return for all her wond'rous goodness, Left the fair mourner to deplore her fate; To pine in solitude, and die at length Of the slow pangs that rend the broken heart. Theseus. Oh! fortune, fortune!âwherefore was I born With a great heart, that loves, that honours virtue, And yet thus fated to be passion's slave? Pirithous. 'Tis but one effort, and you tow'r above The little frailties that debase your nature. That were true victory, worth all your conquests. You triumph o'er yourself. And lo! behold Th' occasion offers.âAriadne comes! Theseus. I must not see her now. Pirithous. By heav'n, you shall. Theseus. Off, loose your hold. Confusion, shame, and horror, Rage and despair, distract and rend my soul. 'Tis you have fix'd these scorpions in my breast. Pirithous. And yetâ (holding him.) Theseus. No more; let midnight darkness hide me In some deep cave, where I may dwell with madness, Far from the world, far from a friend like thee. [Exit. Pirithous. Misguided man! my friendship still shall save him. Ariadne, Pirithous. Ariadne. Stay, Theseus, stay: does he avoid my presence? Why with that haste, that wild disorder'd lookâ Pirithous. 'Tis now the moment of suspended fate: The gods assembled hold th' uplifted balance, And my friend's peace, all that is dear, or sacred, His fame, and honour tremble in the scale. Ariadne. The gods protect him still: you need not fear. All danger flies before him. Pirithous. While the king Detains him here, he knows to what excess A monarch's loveâ Ariadne. Does that alarm his fear? And does he therefore fly?âUngen'rous Theseus! And is it thus you judge of Ariadne? And yet, Pirithous, I will not upbraid him. His tender sensibility of heart Too quickly takes th' alarm: yet that alarm Shews with what strong solicitude he loves; My tears prevail, and he may sail for Greece. This very moment Periander grantedâ See, where he comes: he will confirm it all. Pirithous. It were not fit he should behold me here. When apt occasion serves, we'll meet again. A heart like yours, with every virtue fraught, Should be no more deceiv'd. I now withdraw. [Exit. Ariadne. Go, tell my Theseus all his fears are vain. In love, as well as war, he still must triumph. Periander, Ariadne. Periander. If once again I trouble your retreat, Deem me not, princess, too importunate, Nor with indignant scorn reject a heart, That throbs in every vein for thee alone. Ariadne. Scorn in your presence, Sir, no mind can feel. Far other sentiments your martial glory, And the mild feelings of your gen'rous nature, Excite in every breast. The crown you wear, From virtue's purest ray derives it's lustre. Your subjects own a father in their king. Beneath your sway the wretched ever find A sure retreat. At Periander's court All hearts rejoice: here mis'ry dries her tear. To me your kind humanity has giv'n It's best protection. For the gen'rous act My heart o'erflows: these tears attest my thanks. To you each day beholds me bow with praise, Respect, and gratitude. Periander. And must respect, Fruitless respect, and distant cold regard, Be all my lot? Has heav'n no other bliss In store for me? unhappy royalty! Condemn'd to shine in solitary state, With no fond tenderness of mutual hope, To soothe the heart, and sweeten all its cares; Without the soft society of love. Ariadne. For thee the gods reserve sublimer joys, The happiness supreme of serving millions. 'Tis your's, in war to guard a people's rights; In peace, to spread one common bliss to all, And feel the raptures of that best ambition. Mankind demand you: glory is your call. Periander. Ambition is the phrenzy of the soul; The fierce insatiate avarice of glory, That wades through blood, and marks it's way with ruin: And when it's toils are o'er, what then remains, But to look back through wide dispeopled realms? Where nature mourns o'er all the dreary waste, And hears the widows', and the orphans' shrieks, And sees each laurel wither at the groans, And the deep curses of a ruin'd people. Vain efforts all! vain the pursuit of glory, Unless bright beauty arm us for the field, Hail our return, enhance the victor's prize, And love reward what love itself inspir'd. Ariadne. The vast renown, that spreads such lustre round you, Like the bright sun, that dims all meaner rays, And makes a desert in the blue expanse, Will never want uplifted wond'ring eyes To gaze upon it. From the neighb'ring states Some blooming virgin, some illustrious princess Will yield with rapture to a monarch's love, Proud of a throne, which virtue has adorn'd. Periander. That pow'r is your's: one kind indulgent glance, One smile, the harbinger of soft consent, Has bliss in store beyond the reach of fortune, Beyond ambition's wish. Ariadne. Your pardon, Sir. I must not hear you sigh, and sigh in vain. Look round your isle, where in it's fairest forms, In all it's winning graces, beauty decks Your splendid court. Amidst the radiant train, If none has touch'd your heart, may I presumeâ Perhaps you'll think mine a too partial voiceâ If none attract you, see where PhÃ¦dra shines In every grace, in each attractive charm Of outward form, and dignity of mind. Her rare perfections, her unequall'd virtue, The mild affections of her gen'rous heart, Her friendship firm, in ev'ry instance tried, Transcend all praise. In her pure virgin breast Love never kindled yet his secret flame. Your voice may wake desires unfelt before: With pride she'll listen, and may crown your vows With all th' endearments of a love sincere, And with her softer lustre grace your throne. Periander. Why, cruel, torture me with cold disdain? With thee to reign were Periander's glory. Ariadne. Oh! not for me that glory: well you know This heart already is another's right. Periander. There lies the precipice on which you tread. By your own hand 'tis cover'd o'er with flowr's: Your fall will first discover it. Ariadne. Those words Dark and mysteriousâ Periander. It were not fit That fond credulity should lead you on In gay delusion, and in errors maze. The base deceiverâ Ariadne. Who?âwhat dost thou mean? Periander. I mean to save you from his treach'rous arts; To place you on a throne, beyond his reach, Where foul ingratitude will see her shafts Fall pow'rless at your feet. Ariadne. Cold tremors shoot,â I know not why,âthrough all my trembling frameâ Periander. Tender, sincere, and generous yourself, You little know the arts of faithless man. Ariadne. Explain; unfold; you freeze my soul with horror. Periander. Beware of Theseus! Ariadne. How! of Theseus saidst thou? Periander. Were I this day to send him hence a victim, (And you alone, your tears suspend my purpose) 'Twere vengeance due to perfidy like his. Ariadne. The viper-tongue of slander wrongs him much. Too well I know his worth: my heart's at peace. Periander. With fond enchantment the gay Siren hope Has lur'd you, on a calm unruffled sea, To trust a smiling sky, and flatt'ring gales. Too soon you'll see that sky deform'd with clouds; Too soon you'll wonder at the gath'ring storm, And look aghast at the deep lurking ruin, Where all your hopes must perish. Ariadne. Still each word Is wrapt in darkness: end this dread suspense, Or else my flutt'ring soul will soon forsake me, And leave me at your feet a breathless corse. Periander. A former flameârestrain that wild surprize; Summon your strength:âI speak his very words: A former flame, kindled long since in Greece, Preys on his heart with slow consuming fires. Ariadne. Does this become a monarch? Can your pride Thus lowly stoop, thus with a tale suborn'd To tempt the honour of this faithful breast? Periander. By ev'ry pow'r that views the heart of man, And watches mortal thoughts, tis truth I utter. Last night admitted to a private audience, He own'd it all; renounc'd your love for ever; Gave up his fair pretensions.âAriadne, Your colour changes, and the gushing tear Starts from your trembling eye.â Ariadne. The very thoughtâ Though sure it cannot be,âthe very thought Strikes to my heart like the cold hand of death. Periander. If still you doubt, go charge him with his guilt: He will avow it all. Ariadne. And if he does, Oh! what a change in one disastrous day! Periander. Your fate now calls for firm, decisive measures. I will no longer urge th' ungrateful subject. I leave you to collect your flutt'ring spirits. I would not see your gen'rous heart deceiv'd. His guilt should rouze your noblest indignation. Now you may prove the greatness of your soul. [Exit. Ariadne alone. If this be so, if Theseus can be false, Is there on earth a wretch so curs'd as I am! A former flameâha! think no moreâthat thought, With ruin big, shoots horror to my brain. A former flame still rages in his soul! So said the king: Who is the fatal fair? Where, in what region does she hide her charms? Was it for her I sav'd him from destruction? For her rebell'd against my father's pow'r? To give to her all that my heart adores? Can Theseus thusâno, yonder sun will sooner Start from his orbit.âYet, why shun my presence? Why all this day that stern, averted look? I'm torn, distracted, tortur'd with these doubts; And where, oh! where to fix! I think him still All truth, all honour, tenderness and love. And yet Pirithousâit is all too plain; All things conspire; all things inform against him. He will avow it!âLet me seek him straight, Unload my breast, and charge him with my wrongs; With indignation harrow up his soul; Tell all I've heard, all that distracts my brain; Pour forth my rage, pour forth my fondness too, And perhaps prove him innocent at last. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the FOURTH. Ariadne. Where, Ariadne, where are now the hours That wing'd with rapture chas'd each other's flight, In one gay round of joy? Where now the hopes, That promis'd years of unextinguish'd love? 'Tis past; the dream is fled; the sun grows dim; Fair day-light turns to darkness; all within me Is desolation, horror, and despair. And are his vows, breath'd in the face of heav'n, Are all his oaths at once dispers'd in air? Those eyes, whose glance sent forth the melting soul, Were they too false? The tears, with which he oft Bedew'd his bosom, were they taught to feign? He shuns me still: where does he lurk conceal'd? In all our haunts, in each frequented grove, (Ah! groves too conscious of the traitor's vows!) In vain I've sought him. Does this hated rival, Has she seduc'd him to her am'rous parley? Gods! does she see him smile, and hear that voice? And does he sigh, and languish at her feet, Enamour'd gaze, and twine those arms around her? Hold, traitor, hold; the gods forbid your love; Those looks, those smiles are mine: deluded maid! Mine are those vows, that fond embrace is mine. Horror! distraction; still 'tis but surmise That with these shadowings makes me tremble thus. I still may wrong him:âPeriander's fraudâ 'Tis he abuses my too credulous ear. The tale may be suborn'd:âI'll not believe it. Lost Ariadne! you believe too much. Where, where is PhÃ¦dra? her unwearied friendship May still avert my ruin: she may find The barb'rous man, and melt his heart to pity. And yet she comes not: ha!âPirithous here! He knows the worst: he can pronounce my doom. Pirithous, Ariadne. Pirithous. Forgive me, princess, with officious zeal If I once more intrude. The time no longer Admits of wav'ring, hesitating doubt. The king, enfetter'd in the chains of love, Rejects the claims of Greece. If hence you part, You must, with Theseus, steer your course for Crete. His resolution's fix'd Ariadne. Does Theseus know Th' impending danger? have you seen your friend? Pirithous. His great heart labours with a war of passions Too big for utt'rance. In the soldier's eye The silent tear stood trembling. Strong emotions Convuls'd his frame. He knows your ev'ry virtue, And rails in grief, in bitterness of soul, At his hard fate, and each malignant planet, That leave him empty praise, and fruitless thanks, The only sad return he now can make. Ariadne. Thanks! unavailing thanks! you need not come To add to misery this sharpest pang. Love in this breast is not a vulgar flame, The mere compliance of a will resign'd; 'Tis gen'rous ecstacy, 'tis boundless ardour. A heart, that feels like mine, will not be paid With cold acknowledgments, and fruitless thanks. Mere gratitude is perfidy in love. Pirithous. Your bright perfections were his fav'rite theme. He sees your days, that shone serenely bright, Discolour'd now with sorrows not your own. He sees you following, with unwearied steps, One on whom fortune has not yet exhausted Her stores of malice: whom the gods abandonâ Ariadne. Whom justice, truth, and honour all abandon! Pirithous. It grieves him, Ariadne, much it grieves him To see thee overwhelm'd with his misfortunes: Condemn'd with him to drain the bitter cup Of endless woe; and since propitious fortune With better omens courts you here at Naxos, 'Tis now his wish, that you renounce for ever A man accurst, sad outcast from his country, The fatal cause of all your sorrows past. Ariadne. The fatal cause of all my woes to come! Pirithous. I do not mean to justify his guilt. Might I advise you, you may still be happy. A monarch lays his sceptre at your feet. Your father Minos will approve your choice; All Naxos will consent; a willing people With fond acclaim will hail you as their queen, And Theseus never can betray you more. Ariadne. And dost thou think, say does the traitor think Thus to ensnare me with insidious counsels? Last night admitted to a private audience, To Periander he confess'd his guilt. Another passion rages in his heart. You know it all: unfold your lurking thoughts, Reveal the truth; give me the tale of horror, Own the black treason, and consummate all. Pirithous. Would I could hide the failings of my friend. (aside) Ariadne. Those broken accents but distract me more. Let ruin come: I am prepar'd to meet it. Oh! speak, pronounce my doom: in me you see A wretched princess, a deluded maid, Lost to her friends, her country, and her father. In pity tell me all: with gen'rous frankness Deal with the wretched: let me know the worst. Pirithous. Far be deceit from me: of just resentment I would light up the flame: my friend is plung'd, Beyond all depth, in treachery and guilt. Another love shoots poison to his soul. At length he owns it. He avows his passion. Ariadne. Avows his passion! Pirithous. 'Tis his fatal crime. Ariadne. You hear it, gods! I ask no patience of you; Lend me no fortitude, no strength to bear This horrible deception.âIf your justice From your bright mansions views this scene of guilt, Why sleeps the thunder?âSend me instant madness, To raze at once all traces from my brain, All recollection of a world like this, All busy memory of ungrateful man. Pirithous. Assert yourself; revenge your injur'd rights, And tow'r above the false, the base deserter, Who breaks all vows, and triumphs in his guilt. Ariadne. Can fraud like this engender in the heart? It cannot be; no, the earth does not groan With such a monster! you traduce him, Sir. Who form'd the black design? Who forg'd the tale? 'Tis Periander's art: 'twas he suborn'd you. Pirithous. If you will hear meâ Ariadne. Trouble me no more: Theseus shall hear how his friend blasts his fame, And comes from Athens, with his high commission, To tempt my faith, and work a woman's ruin. [Exit. Pirithous alone. Too gen'rous princess! my heart inward bleeds To see the cruel destiny that waits thee. Ruin, inevitable ruin falls On her, on Theseus, and his blasted fame. And yet if PhÃ¦draâwould some gracious pow'r Inspire my voice, and give the energy To wake, to melt, to penetrate the heartâ What if I seek her?âha!â PhÃ¦dra, Pirithous. PhÃ¦dra. Methought the sound Of Ariadne's voiceâ Pirithous. 'Tis as I wish'd: Her timely presenceâ (aside.) PhÃ¦dra. Went my sister hence? Pirithous. Yes, hence she went, wild as the tempest's rage, As if a conflagration of the soul To madness fir'd her brain. But oh! I fear, She went to brood in secret o'er her wrongs; To think, and to be deeper plung'd in woe. PhÃ¦dra. You chill my heart with fear: you have not told her For whom in secret Theseus breathes his vows; For whom he cherishes the hidden flame. Pirithous. There wants but that, that circumstance of horror, To desolate her soul with instant madness. PhÃ¦dra. Yet why still obstinate, why thus disdain A monarch's vows? a mind like hers, elate With native dignity, and fierce with pride, May view with scorn the lover who betrays her, And on th' imperial throne revenge her wrongs. Pirithous. Revenge is the delight of vulgar souls, Unfit to rule the breast of Ariadne. PhÃ¦dra. Your words, your looks alarm me: from your eye Why shoots that fiery glance? what must we do? Pirithous. What must we do? the honest heart will tell thee. 'Tis in your pow'r: renounce your guilty loves; Do justice to a sister; scorn by fraud, By treach'rous arts to undermine her peace; Restore the lover whom you ravish'd from her, A lover all her own, by ev'ry tie, By solemn vows her own, nor join in guilt To wrest him from her, for the selfish pride, The little triumph o'er a sister's charms. PhÃ¦dra. To Ariadne turn: give her your counsel. She still, if timely wise, may save herself, For joy and rapture: she may live and reign. If I lose Theseus, I can only die. Pirithous. Better to die, than live in vile dishonour. You rush on sure destruction: Awful conscience, That sits in judgment in each human heart, And from that dread tribunal speaks within us: Conscience will tell you, you have broke all faith, Betray'd all confidence, destroy'd the bonds Of sacred friendship, and with shame and infamy Ruin'd a sister, who would die to serve you. PhÃ¦dra. Inhuman that thou art! why wound me thus With stern reproach? why arm against my peace, With scorpion whips, these furies of the soul? Pirithous. For this wilt thou invade a sister's rights? For this betray her? to endure for ever The self-accusing witness in the heart! Remorse will be your portion: shame and anguish Will haunt your nights, and render all your days Unblest and comfortless. PhÃ¦dra. It is too much, Too much to bear this agony of mind. Pirithous. 'Tis virtue speaks; it warns you: hear it's voice, And ere too deeply you are plung'd in guilt, Return with honour, and regain the shore. PhÃ¦dra. No more; it is too much: I cannot bear it. Pirithous. Greece honours Ariadne: think when Theseus Returns with glory stain'd, with foul dishonour, Think of the black reverse. Will men receive With songs of triumph, and with shouts of joy, Him, and his fugitive?âI see you're mov'd: Those tears are symptoms of returning virtue. PhÃ¦dra. You've turn'd my eyes with horror on myself. Oh! thou hast conquer'd: Ariadne, take, Take back your lover; I resign him to you. No, PhÃ¦dra will not live the slave of vice; I will not bear this torture of the mind, Goaded by guilt, pale, trembling at itself. Pirithous. There spoke the gen'rous soul: to those emotions May the gods give the energy of virtue. PhÃ¦dra. Go, say to Theseus, for his love I thank him; Bid him renounce, forget meâCan he do it? Bid him preserve his honour, and his life. You need not counsel himâhe will not fall A willing victim for a wretch like me. Yet, if his heart consents, let him forget His vows, his plighted faith; and as he once With unfelt ardour could delude my sister, Bid him once more dissemble, and betray. Pirithous. Oh! blest event! all danger will retreat. I leave you now, while nature stirs within you, I leave you to th' emotions of your heart. [Exit. PhÃ¦dra alone. Oh! what a depth of sorrow and remorse, Of shame and infamy have I escap'd! Just gods! to you I bend: your warning voice Has taught me to renounce all guilty joys, And dwell, fair virtue! dwell with peace and thee. Theseus, and PhÃ¦dra. Theseus. PhÃ¦dra, what mean those tears? upon the wing Of strong impatience I have sought your presence. What new alarmâ PhÃ¦dra. My soul is full of horror. Renounce my love; forget me; think no more Of rashly plighted vows. Theseus. Renounce thee, PhÃ¦dra? PhÃ¦dra. Fly my disastrous love: disgrace and ruin Are all the portion PhÃ¦dra has to give. Theseus. Is that my PhÃ¦dra's voice? Can she talk thus? The tyrant fair, who first inspir'd my heart With love unfelt before? I struggled long To stifle in my breast the hidden flame; I fled your presence; wheresoe'er I fled Your image follow'd, and I still lov'd on. In vain I struggled: your discerning eye What could escape? you fann'd the rising flame, And soon my flutt'ring heart was wholly thine. PhÃ¦dra. Call not to memory the fond delight. My guilt stands forth to view; I own it all. Theseus. And were the graces of each winning smile Meant only to deceive me? Were those eyes Instructed how to roll the bidden glance, To fool me with a mockery of hope, Then spurn me from your arms a wretch despis'd? PhÃ¦dra. I must not, will not hear; the gods forbid it. I see my sister pale, deform'd with murder, And hear the curses of mankind condemn me. Your friend has told me all. Theseus. Pirithous? PhÃ¦dra. He. Theseus. Is he too join'd? is he too leagu'd against me? PhÃ¦dra. It was his friendship spoke. Theseus. Then send me hence A victim to appease your father's rage, To be a spectacle for public view, And meet at length an ignominious death. PhÃ¦dra. Heart-breaking sounds! (aside.) Theseus. Or if, ungen'rous fair, If you will have it so, command me hence Once more to sigh at Ariadne's feet, And to that beautyâPhÃ¦dra have a care: That lovely form the wond'ring eyes of men Adore, and even envy must admire. Beauty like her's may twine about my heart, And gain, though much I've struggled to resist her, And gain at length my fond consent to wed her. PhÃ¦dra. Consent to wed her! death is in the thought! Perfidious traitor! practis'd in deceit! And can another, after all your oaths, Oh! light inconstant man! ah! can a rival Blot out all fond remembrance of your love, And twine her fatal charms about your heart? Consent to wed her! go,âabandon PhÃ¦dra; Seek Ariadne; to her matchless beauty Breathe all your vowsâthose you can well dissemble; Go, melt in tearsâthose too you well can feign; Revel in joys your heart will never taste, And see me laid a victim at your feet? Theseus. Restrain this frantic rage, does this become The tender moment, when the faithful Theseus With all a lover's ardour comes to greet thee? PhÃ¦dra. The thought of losing thee turns wild my brain. Oh! love resumes his empire o'er my soul, And all inferior motives yield at once. These tears can witnessâ Theseus. 'Tis no time for tears. Go seek your sister: your soft pray'rs and tears May still prevail. If not, to-morrow's dawn, Tell her, shall end her doubts: ere that I've plann'd Measures, that may make sure our mutual bliss. To Periander I must now repair. His messengers have sought me. Oh! remember My life, my hope of bliss, must spring from thee. [Exit. PhÃ¦dra alone. And on his fate my happiness is grafted. Ha! Ariadne comes!âOh! love, what virtues You force me to betray!âThat haggard mien, Those looks proclaim the tumult of her soul. Ariadne, PhÃ¦dra. Ariadne. In vain I struggle to deceive myself. I am betray'd, abandon'd, lost for ever. [not perceiving PhÃ¦dra. PhÃ¦dra. How her fierce rage shoots lightning from her eyes. (aside.) Ariadne. Oh! while his accents charm'd my list'ning ear, While each fond look ensnar'd my captive heart, Ev'n then another lur'd the wand'rer from me; Another's beauty taught those eyes to languish; Another's beauty tun'd his voice to love. PhÃ¦dra. Appease her anger, gods, and grant her patience. (aside.) Ariadne. And must I live to see her haughty triumph? To bear her scorn? to bear th' insulting pity Of Cretan dames! all pleas'd with my undoing? To die at length in misery of heart, And leave to after-times a theme of woe, A tragic story for the bards of Greece? PhÃ¦dra. How my heart shrinks! I dread the interview. (aside.) Ariadne. Let lightning blast me first; let whirlwinds seize me, To atoms dash me on the craggy cliff, Or blow me hence upon the warring winds To climes unknown, beyond the verge of nature, To the remotest planet in the void; That never, never can approach this world; But rolling onward, farther, farther still Holds in the wilds of space it's fated round; Where I may rave; and to the list'ning waste Pour forth my sorrows; think till reason leaves me; And tell to other stars, and other suns A tale to hold them in their course suspended, And turn them pale with horror at the sound. There let me dwell; grow savage with my wrongs, And never hear from this vile globe again. PhÃ¦dra. Yet be of comfort. Ariadne. There's no comfort for me. Whence is that voice? Oh! PhÃ¦dra, Oh! my sister, Assist me, help me; I am sick at heart. PhÃ¦dra. Recall your reason, summon all your strength, Nor thus afflict yourself. Ariadne. Have I not cause? The barbarous man! he flies me; he abjures me; Breaks all the fervent vows, which each day's sun, Which ev'ry conscious planet of the night, Which ev'ry god bent down from heav'n to hear. PhÃ¦dra. And yet if calmly you will hear a sisterâ Ariadne. Could you suspect that perfidy like this Can lie close ambush'd in the heart of man? PhÃ¦dra. But still, if Theseus harass'd out with woes, Pursued by fate, and bending to misfortuneâ Ariadne. I gave up all for him. PhÃ¦dra. Were you but calmâ Ariadne. Can the wretch tortur'd on the rack be calm? Ingratitude! thou source of evil deeds! Foe to the world's repose! thou canst with fair, With specious words, with treacherous disguise, Deceive the friend, and thrive upon his smiles; By servile arts enrich thee with his spoils, Till pamper'd to the full, with favours bloated, Thy hour is come to shew thy native hue, And carry pain, and anguish to the breast, That warm'd and cherish'd thee. Detested fiend! By thee truth fades ev'n from the noblest mind; Of fair, and good, and just no trace remains; Honour expires, the gen'rous purpose dies, And ev'ry virtue withers in the soul. PhÃ¦dra. Yet be advis'd, and you may still be happy. A youthful monarch woos you to his throne. The gods have sent reliefâ Ariadne. Oh! PhÃ¦dra, oh! my sister, As yet a stranger to man's wily arts, You keep the even tenour of your mind: You know not what it is to love like me. PhÃ¦dra. Oh! conscious, conscious guilt. (aside.) Ariadne. I see you pity me. It grieves me to afflict your tender nature. In all his hours of tenderness and love, Oh! charming hours, that must return no more! I never deem'd it was illusion all, Never suspected a more happy rival, Saw not her image lurking in his heart. Tell me her name: Who is she? Let me see The fatal fair, that poisons all my joys. Your own heart, PhÃ¦dra, must condemn the deed. PhÃ¦dra. Her words too deeply pierce; they rend my soul. (aside.) Ariadne. You can detect the traitress; guide me to her. If on this isleâha!âwhy that sudden pause? That downcast eye? why does your colour change? Oh! now I see you know her: in your looks I read it all. PhÃ¦dra. Confusion, shame, distraction! (aside.) If this wild fury, that deforms your reasonâ Ariadne. PhÃ¦dra, beware: if you deceive your sister, If you conceal this rival, 'twere a deed To shock all nature; to make heav'n and earth, And men and gods abhor thee. PhÃ¦dra. Since unjustly You thus suspect meâhave I giv'n you cause? Ariadne. Disclose it all, and league not with my foes. PhÃ¦dra. I see my fault: with too officious care I came to heal your sorrows.âI forbear: I've been to blame; but now, farewell, farewell. Ariadne. Stay, PhÃ¦dra, stay; you shall not leave me thus. In all afflictions you are still my comfort. PhÃ¦dra. Then check this fury; it is phrenzy all. Where is the pride becoming Minos' daughter? Disdain the traitor; drive him from your thoughts. Turn where the gods invite you: Periander Wishes to lay his sceptre at your feet. Your sway shall bless the land, and humbled Theseus Will be reduc'd to sue to you for mercy. The pow'r will then be yours, the envied pow'r Of Godlike clemency: 'twill then be yours To shew thee worthy of imperial sway, To shelter still the man you once could love; Know him insensible to worth like thine, To honour lost, and yet forgive him all. Ariadne. Must I transfer th' affections of my soul, To justify his perfidy? must I Bargain away my heart, to save a traitor? For the fair Greek to save him? Mighty gods! He shall not wed her: give her to my rage. I'll follow to the altar; there my vengeanceâ How my heart shrinksâno, strikeâmy blood recoilsâ Assist me, PhÃ¦dra, give the means of death. She shall not live to revel in his arms. Then Theseus shall behold her faded form, And ev'ry drop the traitor then lets fall Shall pay me for the tears, the galling tears, His perfidy has cost me: then he'll know The agony of soul, the mortal pang, When we are robb'd of all the heart adores. PhÃ¦dra. Ha! will you sister stain your hand with blood? Ariadne. Then Theseus tooâHe clings about my heart;â No, let him sail for Crete; my father's justice Will claim atonement for a daughter's wrongs, Doom him a sacrifice for broken vows, A dreadful warning to ungrateful man. Enter Pirithous. Pirithous. Your woes encrease each hour. A guard ev'n now Leads Theseus forth, by Periander's order, To yonder tow'r, that overhangs the bay. From thence, ere morn, he must depart for Crete. PhÃ¦dra. Ah! there to perishâAriadne, haste, Seek Periander, fly, prevent the stroke. Ariadne. He can no more deceive me. PhÃ¦dra. Will you, then, Ah! will you, cruel, see him doom'd to die? I'll seek the king, and bathe his feet with tears, And rave, and shriek, till he release him to me. [Exit. Pirithous. If he must fall, 'tis you have fix'd his doom. You still can save him. At one glance from you The king will feel his resolution melt. Ariadne. I sav'd him once, and he requites me for it. No more of tenderness. The gen'rous deed But gives to fell ingratitude the pow'r With scorpion stings to pierce you to the heart. Pirithous. Yet, Ariadne, thinkâ Ariadne. No more, but leave me. [Exit Pirithous. Ariadne alone. Yes, yet let the traitor die:âIf he must die, In some dark cave I can deplore his fate, Hid from the world, forgetting all but him, Till the kind hand of death shall lay me stretch'd, In cold oblivion on the flinty ground, Pale, wan, and senseless as the marble form That lies in sorrow on some virgin's tomb. He will not see my tears: the barb'rous man Will be no more ungrateful.âMighty gods! I lov'd, I am betray'd, yet love him still. Quick let me hence:âone gen'rous effort more May stillâfond wishes how you rush upon me! Should he relent,âOh! should returning love Once moreâvain hope! yet the delusion charms me: One gen'rous effort more may make him mine. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the FIFTH. Scene, a wild Heath, with a Tower in View. Enter Aletes, followed by an Officer. Aletes. Justice prevails, and Theseus is my prisoner; Yon tow'r immures him close. Seek thou the harbour, Unmoor the ship; let all things be prepar'd To give the spreading canvass to the wind. The day declines, and the moon's silver beam Plays on the trembling wave. This night 'tis fix'd Theseus with me shall seek the Cretan shore. [Exit Officer. Enter Ariadne. Ariadne. Where is your prisoner? Aletes. In yon tow'r secur'd. Ariadne. Your policy has fail'd; release him straight: 'Tis the king's order; you may read it, sir. (gives him a paper.) Aletes. Your interest has prevail'd, and I obey. (goes into the tower.) Ariadne alone. Ye fond ideas, ye fierce warring passions, With what a mingled sway you drive me on! Grief, rage, and indignation rise by turns; But love flows in, and resolution dies. Ha! see he comesâOh! how this flutt'ring tumult, With hopes and fears alternate, shakes my frame. Enter Theseus from the Tower. Ariadne (viewing him as he advances.) Dissimulation fails him, and his looks No longer hide the characters of guilt. Theseus. How shall I pour my thanks? a thousand sentiments All press at once, and yet deny me utterance. Words are too poor: expression strives in vain. Ariadne. You need no more dissemble. Periander Has heard the purpose of your soul. Last night, When sleep seal'd ev'ry eye, in darkness wrapt, Thro' secret ways, clandestine as your thoughts, You stole into his presence; there disclos'd Your hidden flame, your alienated heart. (turns from him.) Theseus. Spare your reproaches, princess; Oh! forbear, Forbear in pity to afflict a mind Too deeply wounded! that feels all its errors, Feels all your virtues, and with keenest sense Aches at its own reflections. Ariadne. Of the pardon Which Periander to my pray'rs has granted, You know not the extent. To-morrow's sun Shall light you to your nuptials; you may then Shew to the world this unapparent beauty, And give to her the vows that once were mine. Theseus. Oh! Ariadne, spare this keen reproof. Could you but know the pangs that struggle hereâ Ariadne. Theseus, you weep! you weep o'er my afflictions; You feel my wrongs, yet barb'rous ev'n in pity, You fix the shaft of anguish in my heart. Theseus. On me, on me the weight of ruin falls; 'Tis I am plung'd in woe; a man condemn'd, To wander o'er the world. Alas, 'tis fate, Fate drives me on. If you forget a wretch, The prey of grief, the sport of fortune's malice; And if a monarch, to reward your virtues, Prepares th' imperial wreathe to deck your browâ Ariadne. Is that the recompence I wish'd to gain? Too well you know this heart. Had Periander A wider empire than e'er monarch rul'd, And you were helpless, destitute of fortune, I had been, heav'n can witness! happy with you. In loving you, I sought yourself alone. Theseus. For all this waste of generous affection, Calamity is all that Theseus brings. Ariadne. Come lead me hence to some far distant wild, Where human footstep never prints a trace; There bless'd with thee I could for ever dwell, Thron'd in thy heart, the mistress of thy love. Theseus. Here happiness awaits you; here you're destin'd The mild vicegerent of the gods on earth. In that bright sphere while you serenely shine, The pattern of all virtue, temp'ring justice With mercy, and diffusing blessings round you, With tears of joy mankind will own your sway. Ariadne. Thou vile ingrate! Theseus. If you will deign to hear me: Though great my crimesâ Ariadne. Thou traitor!âwas it thus You look'd and talk'd, when first I saw and lov'd? Your doom was fix'd; the officers of vengeance Remorseless led you forth; my trembling eye Pursued your steps; tears gush'd; I could not speak. I fled to your relief, and my undoing: Then ev'ry god was witness to your vows. The fond delusion charm'd me. I rebell'd Against my father; I betray'd his honour; And all for thee. I fled my native land. Nor winds, nor waves, nor exile could debar me. This the return!âhave I deserv'd it of you? Tell me my crime; and, oh! if possible, Teach me to think 'tis justice that I suffer: For ev'n in ruin I would not abhor thee. Theseus. You wrong me much: By yon bright stars I swear, I never meant by base ingratitude To fix affliction in that bosom-softness. Thy name, thy merit, and thy wond'rous goodness, While life informs this frame, shall ever live Esteem'd and honour'd, treasur'd in my heart. Ariadne. Esteem'd and honour'd! 'twas your love you promis'd. A monarch, saidst thou, woos me to his arms! What truth, what fair return have I to give him? Give me, barbarian! give me back my heart, The heart you robb'd me off: Give back my vows, My artless vows, my pure unpledg'd affections, With equal warmth that I may meet his love; And not like thee, with treach'rous bland allurements, Court his embrace, and charm him to betray. Theseus. Then if you will, wreak your worst vengeance on me. Ascend the throne; back to the Cretan shore Convey me hence to glut your father's rage: I there can die content. Or if your mercy Permit me once again to visit Greece, Oft I shall hear of Ariadne's name; Well pleas'd at distance, in the humble vale Of private life, or in the tented field, To view the radiant glory that surrounds you, And thank the gods for shedding blessings down On thee and all thy race. Ariadne. Go, visit Greece; Display to Athens all your brave exploits, Your battles won, the nations you have conquer'd. And let your banners, waving high in air, Hold forth the bright inscription to men's eyes, âLo! this is he, who triumph'd o'er a woman.â My death will blazon forth the fame of him, Who freed the world from monsters of the desert, Who slew the Minotaur, but could not quell Ingratitude, that monster of the soul. Theseus. You need not, Ariadne, oh! you need not Thus tear me piece-meal. My distracted heart Feels in each nerve, and bleeds at ev'ry vein. Ariadne. Unbidden tears, why will you fool me thus? These tears that fall, that thus gush out perforce, Are not the tears of supplicating love. They are the tears of burning indignation, Of shame, and rage, and pride, and conscious virtue; Virtue that feels, feels at the very heart Each stab inhuman treachery has giv'n, Yet sees that calm tranquillity in guilt. Enter PhÃ¦dra. PhÃ¦dra. Once more restor'd to liberty, and life. [to Theseus. Theseus. Oh! death were happiness to what I feel. Ariadne. See me no more; to-morrow spread your sails; Take in your train the partner of your heart. She shall not go: once more I'll see the king, And dare not on thy life convey her hence. PhÃ¦dra. What meddling fiend inflames you thus to madness? Hear, Ariadne, hear. Ariadne. Go, sail for Athens, (to Theseus.) Alone, heart-broken, comfortless; like me Plung'd in despair; like me depriv'd of all Your heart held dear. PhÃ¦dra. Let me appease your wrath. Ariadne. I will descend to pray'rs and tears no more. Farewell for ever; oh! ungrateful man! [Exit. Theseus, PhÃ¦dra. Theseus. Distraction! madness! oh! she has destroy'd My peace of mind for ever. PhÃ¦dra. Theseus, no; My lenient care shall mitigate your grief. Theseus. For thee, my PhÃ¦dra, I bear all for thee. Since liberty is mine, let me employ it To serve our mutual bliss. The time admits No dull delay. This moment I must leave thee. PhÃ¦dra. Ah! whither do you go? Theseus. Observe me well. That path, that winds along the barren heath, Leads to the mountain's ridge: There down the steep A soft declivity will guide your steps To Neptune's temple, shelter'd in the grove. There I expect you. PhÃ¦dra. Wherefore? what intent? Unfold the dark design; my fears alarm me. Theseus. No more; the sun descends, and sable night Draws o'er the face of things her dusky veil. With cautious step proceed; but ere you go, Watch Ariadne: here beguile her stay. If she pursues me, all is lost for ever. Farewell, farewell, I trust my fate with thee. [Exit. PhÃ¦dra alone. Oh! how my bosom pants with doubt and fear! What may this mean? some dread event impends. He will not, no, preserve him gracious pow'rs! Let him not, prompted by despair, attempt Beyond his strength, and rush on sure destruction. Ariadne, PhÃ¦dra. Ariadne. Where, PhÃ¦dra, whither is the traitor fled? PhÃ¦dra. Oh! you have been to blame: with haggard eyes Upturn'd to heav'n, he paus'd, and heav'd a sigh, As if his lab'ring heart would burst his frame, And leave him here, a pale, a breathless corse. At length with haste, with fury in his look, But blessing still your name, he rush'd along, And vanish'd from my sight. Ariadne. The barb'rous man! Did he deny his falsehood? Did one tear Speak his compunction? Did he once relent? In guilt obdurate! did you mark his mien, The pride, the scorn that darted from his eye? PhÃ¦dra. What choice was left him, when with fierce disdain You spurn'd him from you? Ariadne. Therefore did he shun me? Ungen'rous man! he saw I lov'd him most, Then when enrag'd I pour'd my curses on him: My heartstrings ev'n then were twin'd about him. Once more I'll see him: should he sail for Athens, 'Tis fix'd to follow him. He will not then Dare to avow a treachery like this. His glory is at stake: with one accord All hearts declare for me. The sons of Greece, For all my sorrows, all my sufferings past, Wish to reward me in their hero's arms. PhÃ¦dra. And does Pirithous join you? does he mean To waft you o'er the deep? Ariadne. His ship already From last night's storm refitted, courts the breeze, And even now prepares to plough the deep. PhÃ¦dra. Theseus, the while, in pining discontent, Forlorn and wretched on the blasted heath, Sighs to the winds, and drinks his falling tears. Ariadne. Oh! fly, pursue him, calm his troubled spirit. Still, traitor as he is, he may relent. For oh! too well I know his godlike nature; Know the mild virtues, that adorn his mind, And more than speak in each enchanting look. Go, seek him PhÃ¦dra: tell him all my woes, And reconcile his heart to love and me. But hark! some step this wayâ PhÃ¦dra. Pirithous comes! Ariadne. Haste, fly, pursue him, find the barb'rous man. PhÃ¦dra. I leave you now. Ariadne. Farewell. PhÃ¦dra. Where shall we meet? Ariadne. In yonder palace. PhÃ¦dra. There you may expect me. [Exit. Ariadne. Oh! grant her pow'r to touch, to melt his heart. Pirithous, Ariadne. Pirithous. I bring you tidings may revive your hopes. Theseus may still be thine. Ariadne. May still be mine? Pirithous. Yes; Periander, should he still persist To hold you here a captive, sees his danger. Crete arms against him: Athens too will claim you, And let destruction loose. To cope with both, Not ev'n the soul of Periander dares. He must release you: then you sail for Greece. Theseus will there be yours: his solemn vows, And the vast debt of gratitude he owes, Join'd by the public voice, will bind him to you. Ariadne. But if constraint aloneâAh! can you think That his relenting heart will feel remorse? Pirithous. The indignation of mankind will warn him. Returning virtue thenâ Ariadne. If aught can waken A spark of love in that obdurate breast; A look, a sigh impassion'd from the heart, Will heal my sorrows, and with tears of joy Make me forgive him all. I burn once more To wander with him o'er the roaring deep. And has the king consented? Pirithous Ev'n now I left him In close debate, and onward to this spot Bending his eager step. With friendly counsels Archon attends, and seconds all I wish. Lo! where he comes this way. Retire awhile: Yon grove will give you shelter: there remain. A single glance from those persuasive eyes May once again inflame his fierce desires, And reason then will plead your cause in vain. Ariadne. May all your words sink melting to his soul. [Exit. Pirithous. Now, gods, assist me: if I now succeed, My fears subside, and danger is no more. Periander, and Pirithous. Periander. Pirithous, hear: this hour ends all debate. My resolution's fix'd: then urge no more Your haughty claim: 'tis torture to my heart. Pirithous. A heart like thine will generously love. You will not force the princess to your arms, Nor light with Hymen's torch the flames of war. Periander. Ha! dost thou deem me of so fierce a spirit, To tyrannize the fears of Ariadne? No, her own lip, the musick of that voice, To my delighted ear shall breathe the promise, The soft avowal of her mutual flame. Pirithous. She doats on Theseus: the wide world has heard The story of her love. And can you hope To turn awry the current of affection From him, who first awak'd her young desires, Still fans the flame, and lords it o'er her soul? Periander. Let him depart: I have releas'd him to you. Then Ariadne will resent her wrongs, Incline her heart, and listen to my vows. Bear your friend hence: my orders shall be issued. For Ariadne trouble me no more. [Exit. Pirithous, alone. Proud monarch go! This night shall mar your hopes: This very night, while sleep lulls all your guards, She shall embark. When lawless pow'r prevails, The noble end must justify the means. Ariadne, Pirithous. Ariadne. Thou gen'rous man! have you regain'd my freedom? Pirithous. This very night we quit the hated shore. Enquire no more: you must embark with me. For Theseus, he will gladly join our flight. Ariadne. All things invite us: from the sky bursts forth A stream of radiance, and the level main Presents a wide expanse of quiv'ring light. Where is my sister? Pirithous. She must here remain. Ariadne. No, it were perfidy, a breach of friendship. She fled with me: our hearts were ever join'd By the sweet ties of friendship and of love. Pirithous. Here she must stay; your happiness requires it. Ariadne. What is her crime? Ah! why should we desert her? Pirithous. Seek not to know too much. Ariadne. No, PhÃ¦dra, no; I cannot leave thee here. Enter Archon. Archon. This very moment A soldier from the harbour brings this letter. To you it is address'd. (gives it to Pirithous.) Pirithous. And comes from Theseus. Ariadne. From Theseus!âwherefore?âwhence?âwhat new event?â Pirithous reads. âMy heart's too full to vent itself in words. âI know my conduct will be blam'd by all. âI will not varnish it by vain excuse. âI seiz'd your ship: we have already pass'd âThe head-land of the harbour. Oh! this consummates all. Ariadne. Why dost thou pause? Proceed; go on; let me be full of horror. (taking the letter.) She reads. âWe have already pass'd âThe head-land of the harbour: sunk in grief, âDistracted with her fears, in wild amaze, âPhÃ¦dra has join'd my flight.â Is PhÃ¦dra with him? Archon. They embark'd together. Ariadne reads. âTo Ariadne âBe ev'ry duty paid, each tender care. âAssuage her sorrows: Periander's love âWill charm each sense, and teach her to forget; âPerhaps in time, when ev'ry bliss attends her, âTo pardon PhÃ¦dra, and the wretched Theseus.â All just and righteousâ (she falls on the ground.) Pirithous. Ah! she faints! she faints: Bring instant help; assist her, lend your aid. (Enter attendant Virgins.) Oh! wretched princess! would the gods allow you To breathe your last, and never wake again To this bad world, 'twere happiness indeed. She stirs, she moves; the blood returns again, But oh! to make her feel the weight of woe, And see the desolation that surrounds her. Ariadne. Where have my senses wander'd? Why around me Are you all fix'd, the statues of despair? Oh! I rememberâOpen earth, and hide me: In your cold caves you never yet receiv'd A wretch betray'd, undone, and lost as I am. Pirithous. Afflicted mourner, raise thee from the earth. Thy woes indeed are great. Ariadne. Could you expect it? (as she rises.) PhÃ¦dra has join'd his flight; she too betrays me. She was my other self; for ever dear; Dear as the drops that circled in my veins, But now, ah! now, to warm this heart no more. Perhaps ev'n now she gazes on his charms, Hangs on each accent, catches from those eyes The sweet enchantment; knows I shed these tears; Knows that I beat this breast, and rend this hair, And tell my sorrows to these craggy cliffs, And rave and shriek, in madness and despair. Haste, fly, pursue them, launch into the main, Arm all your ships, bring swords, bring liquid fire, Fly, overtake them, whelm them in the deep. [Exit. Pirithous. Attend her, virgins, with your tend'rest duty. [Exeunt attendants. Archon. If this be thy contrivanceâ Pirithous. Charge me not With a black deed that has undone my friend, And to the latest time must brand his name. I feel for him; I feel for Ariadne. She now demands our sympathy and care. [Exeunt. The Back Scene opens; the Harbour and the Sea in view. Ariadne, with attendants. Ariadne. Behold, look there, see where the vessel bounds. Oh! horror, horror! how the rapid prow Glides through the waves! will none pursue the traitor? First Virgin. Alas, my royal mistress, 'tis in vain. Ariadne. Turn, Theseus, turn; 'tis Ariadne calls. Return barbarian! whither do you fly? This way direct your course; stay, PhÃ¦dra, stay. See how they bound along the level main, And cleave their way; and catch each gale that blows. Inhuman treachery! (leans on her attendants.) First Virgin. Her grief exhausts her strength, but soon again Despair will rouze her with redoubled force. Ariadne. Heart-piercing sight! and see the traitor still Pursues his course. Yon glitt'ring host of stars Lend all their rays; the elements combine! Ye winds, ye waves, you too are leagu'd against me; You join with guilt, accomplices in fraud! All false as Theseus; all as PhÃ¦dra false; Officious all to end this wretch'd being. Your victory will soon be gained: That pang, Oh! this cold tremorâ'tis the hand of death, I hope it is; my grave is all I ask. (sits down on the point of a rock.) Enter Periander, Pirithous, Archon. Periander. Oh! dire event! Pirithous. See where the beauteous mourner Grows to the rock, and thinks herself to stone. Periander. Rise, princess, rise, and let us bear you hence To your own palace, where the storm of grief Will soon subside, and peace, and love, and joy Revisit your sad heart. (they lead her forward.) Ariadne. No, never, never; My easy heart will be deceiv'd no more. Periander. For thee love still has new delights in store, Whole years of bliss.â Ariadne. Why do you smile upon me? I never serv'd you; never sav'd your life; Made you no promise: why should you deceive me? Periander. May sweet oblivion of her past afflictions Steal gently o'er her soul. Restore her, heav'n! Ariadne. Have you a sister? She will break your heart. Periander. I come to calm your griefs, and crown your days With love sincere, and everlasting truth. Ariadne. All truth is fled; long since she fled the earth, Tir'd of her pilgrimage. Why, holy pow'rs! Why leave poor mortals crawling here below, Where there's no confidence, no trust, no faith! All nature moves by your eternal law; Truth is the law of man, and yet she's fled. I see her there, there near the throne of Jove, Her garment white as her own candid mind; She looks with pity on this vale of error, And drops a tear: while falsehood in disguise, With specious seeming, walks her deadly round, And mask'd in friendship, where she smiles, destroys. Periander. Let me conduct you: trust your friends. Ariadne. You look As if I might believe you: so did Theseus. But where, where is he now?ââTo Ariadne âBe ev'ry duty paid, each tender care!â Oh! artful man!âLook there! I see him still; I see the ship; it lessens to my view, It lessens still! and now, just now it fades! It fades away, it melts into the clouds! Scarce, scarce perceiv'd! tis gone, tis lost, For ever, ever lost! is that the last, The last sad glimpse? and must I linger here? Die, Ariadne, die, and end your woes. (stabs herself.) Periander. Oh! fatal rashness! quick, bring ev'ry help. Pirithous. Deep in her veins the poniard drinks her blood. Ariadne. 'Twas Theseus' gift: his best, his kindest present; As such I sheath'd it in my very heart. Periander. Her flutt'ring soul is on the wing to leave her. Ariadne. Elysium is before me; let not Theseus Pursue me thither; in those realms of bliss Let my departed spirit know some rest. Oh! let me feel ingratitude no more. Keep Theseus here in this abode of guilt; This world is his; let him remain with PhÃ¦dra; Let him be happy; no, the fates forbid it: They will deceive each other. Periander. Ah! that wound Pours fast the stream of life. Ariadne. It gives no pain. It is the stab fell perfidy has given, That rankles here. Oh! raise me, raise me up. No, let me see the light of heav'n no more. Pirithous, you behold your friend's exploit! I thank you Periander; you have been Kind, good, and tender. May some worthier bride, Adorn'd with all that virtue adds to beauty, Endear the joys of life.âAlas, I die. No mother here with pious hand to close My faded eyes; no father o'er my urn To drop a tear, and soothe my pensive shade. No; I deserve it; I betray'd them both. The barb'rous man!âHe stabb'd me to the heart. And yet ev'n then I knew but half my wrongs. And you too PhÃ¦dra! Oh! (dies.) Periander. She's gone, and with her what a noble mind, What gen'rous virtues are there laid in ruin! Pirithous. Thou injur'd innocence! oppress'd with wrongs, And sore-beset, there rests her languish'd head. Oh! when the gods bestow on mortal man That bloom of beauty, those exalted charms, By virtue dignified, they give the best, The noblest gift their bounty has in store: A gift to be esteem'd, ador'd by all; To be protected by the soldier's valour, Not thus betray'd, abandon'd to despair, And the keen pangs of ill requited love.

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, Occasioned by the death of Mr. Henderson, For Mrs. HENDERSON's Night, At the Theatre Royal in Covent-Garden, on Saturday, February 25, 1786. Spoken by Mrs. SIDDONS. Mrs. Siddons, to do honour to the memory of her deceased friend, obtained the consent of the Managers of Drury-Lane, and performed the part of Belvidera. But that character requiring great exertion, and the Prologue being unusually long, several lines, here printed, were omitted on the above night. ERE fiction try this night her magick strain, And blend mysteriously delight with pain; Ere yet she wake her train of hopes and fears For Jaffier's wrongs, and Belvidera's tears; Will you permit a true, a recent grief To vent it's charge, and seek that sad relief? How shall we feel the tale of feign'd distress, While on the heart our own afflictions press? When our own friend, when Henderson expires, And from the tomb one parting pang requires! In yonder Abbey shall he rest his head, And on this spot no virtuous drop be shed? You will indulge our grief:âThose crowded rows Shew you have hearts that feel domestic woes; Hearts, that with gen'rous emulation burn To raise the widow drooping o'er his urn; And to his child, when reason's op'ning ray Shall tell her, whom she lost, this truth convey; Her father's worth made each good man his friend, Honour'd through life, regretted in his end! And for his relatives to help his store An audience gave, when he could give no more. Him we all mourn: his friends still heave the sigh, And still the tear stands trembling in the eye. His was each mild, each amiable art, The gentlest manners, and the feeling heart. Fair simple truth, benevolence to all; A gen'rous warmth, that glow'd at friendship's call. A judg'ment sure, while learning toil'd behind; His mirth was wit; his humour, sense refin'd. A soul above all guile, all meaner views; The friend of science; friend of ev'ry muse! Oft have I known him in my vernal yearâ This no feign'd grief:âno artificial tear! Oft in this breast he wak'd the muses flame, Fond to advise, and point my way to fame. Who most shall praise him, all are still at strife: Expiring virtue leaves a void in life. A void our scene has felt:âwith Shakespeare's page Who now like him shall animate the stage? Hamlet, Macbeth, and Benedick, and Lear, Richard, and Woolsey, pleas'd each learned ear. If feigning well be our consummate art, How great his praise, who in Iago's part Could utter thoughts so foreign to his heart? Falstaff, who shook this house with mirthful roar, Is now no counterfeit:âHe'll rise no more! 'Twas Henderson's the drama to pervade, Each passion touch, and give each nicer shade. When o'er these boards the Roman Father pass'dâ But I forbearâThat effort was his last.â The muse there saw his zeal, though rack'd with pain, While the slow fever ambush'd in each vein. She sought the bed, where pale and wan he lay, And vainly try'd to chase disease away; Watch'd ev'ry look, and number'd ev'ry sigh; And gently,âas he liv'd,âshe saw him die. Wild with her griefs, she join'd the mournful throng, With sullen sound as the hearse mov'd along: Through the dim vaulted isles she led the way, And gave to genius past his kindred clay; Heard the last requiem o'er his relicks cold, And with her tears bedew'd the hallow'd mould. In faithful verse, there near the lonely cell, The fair recording epitaph may tell, That he, who now lies mould'ring into dust, Was good, was upright, generous, and just; By talents form'd, to grace the poet's lays; By virtue form'd, to dignify his days.</field>
