A SUBJECT SELECTED. WORK ROOM AT THOROUGHGOODS. âSew early in the morningââTrueman tries on a suit which doesn't fit. THOROUGHGOOD'S SHOP. How the generous master sends his shopmen out to tea, and how George remains behind and minds the shopâhow Milwood begins havocking his heart, and how he begins a vocking in his sleepâhow he abuses the shop, but appears to love it stillâhow he cuts his old acquaintance, Trueman. AGONY! AT THE UNCLE'S. âA pretty pop-itââthe Discovery, the improper action, and the Proposition. THE RESOLVE! RANELAGH. THE DETERMINATION! GROUNDS AT THE UNCLE'S WILLAR. How the Uncle feels very paulyâthe result of misplaced affectionâthat Uncle of George's and that taunt of Milwoodâ the illusion broken, the lesson learnt, and the lovers happyâhow Folly, having âpointed the moralâ of the piece, âadorns its taleâ by exhibiting to the audience the CHARMING TRANSFORMATION SCENE! (Designed and Painted by C. S. James,) of the DRYAD'S HOME IN FAIRY'S ELFIN FOREST! During this Scene the Theatre will be perfumed with the Odour of Woodland Flowers, by means of Rimmel's Patent Vaporizer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene First. âThe Fields of Fancy. Music. Enter from R. U. E., through cave and down steps to stage, twelve Fairies; Fancy up trap, R. C., with a letter. Fancy. And so this Christmas, '62 and '3 They want a new piece at the Adelphee; Something admitting of no end of funâ A subject, too, that never has been done, If possible. And so to Fancy they Have sent, imagining that Fancy's play May help them out. Alas! they well might know A play of fancy's now considered slow, Bygone, old-fashioned, can't a smile provokeâoh! Nothing to chuckle at, it's quite ro-coa-coa. Plays must be highly spiced for modern taste, The age must run and read, and time won't waste. I must assistance seek:âRomance, attend! Enter Romance and Claptrap up traps, R. Romance, good morrow! Welcome! Who's your friend? Romance (introducing, C.) Allow me, Fancy, Claptrap, (whispers Fancy) Friend in need, You can't get on without him. Fancy (L.) Oh, indeed! Claptrap (R.) I'm he who prompts the author, I confess, To write of âlovely woman in distress.â To make his virtuous peasant say, âThis breast, Although 'tis clad in economic vest, Contains a heartâaââ All that sort of thing. I make my heroes from a high rock fling Themselves into the waves. 'Tis I who bid Six pirates fall before one jack-tar's quid. 'Tis I who prompt the lover in the play, When he's a glorious platitude to say, Never to speak it, but to spout itâshout it! In fact, I'm Claptrap, and that's all about it. Fancy (L.) Something we should concoct, with three to do itâ Enter Folly suddenly, L. trap. Folly. You'd far best trust to me, I'll pull you through it! Romance. (R. C.) And who are you, sir? Folly. (L. C.) I am Follyâdear To me's this special season of the year. As much a part of Christmas time is Folly, As snow, plum pudding, indigestion, holly. You want a subjectâwhat do you suggest? Fancy, you're surely wersed in all that's best. Fancy (L.) My brain I've racked in in hopes ideas to gain; Gone through our acting drama but in vain. See nothing feasible I really can, sir. Folly (L. C.) Well, what say you, Romance? (Romance shrugs her shoulder) That's a rum answer. Claptrap, you can suggest a theme, no doubt. Claptrap. I can't suggest, I only carry out. When you've the subject, plot, and situations, I can oblige you p'raps with some sensations. Folly. And Boxing-night we're just upon the brink ofâ Really it's very terrible to think of. SongâFollyââThere was a little man.â There is a certain man, Who is hard up for a plan, Where upon to hang his parody and pun, pun, pun; There is no subject new: I don't know oneâdo you? It's extremely sad, but everything's been done, done, done. Chorus âIt's extremely sad, &amp;c. [Folly] D'Anois tales, and every baby 'un, And all the Nights Arabian, Have of't been used as vehicles for fun, fun, fun; And down here in the west he Can find nothing for travestie, For the merry folks this Christmas in Lon-don-don-don. Chorus âFor the merry, &amp;c. [Folly] There are some eight, nine or ten p'raps, That will do well o'er again p'raps, And I fancy that George Barnwell may be one, one, one; Romance. George Barnwell! yes, it would, sir; Claptrap. George Barnwell! very good, sir; Folly. Then George Barnwell we'll determine shall be done, done, done. Chorus âThen George Barnwell, &amp;c. Claptrap. I'll lend thee a hand; Folly. Thou art kind. Romance. And I another; Folly. I myself have all the other. Romance (R. C.) I'll plan the story on a new foundation; Claptrap (R.) I'll pop in now and then a âsituation.â Fancy (L.) Fancy shall lend her free, unfettered aid; Folly (L. C.) You will! then Folly's Christmas piece is made; Avoiding personalityâscurrility, Only 'gainst shams exhibiting hostility; Wreathing a garland of jest, prank, and pun, Pointing a moral too amidst our fun. We'll shew the woes of a would-be patrician, The grief to which comes Brummagem ambition; I, in the form of Lady Milwood, will With foolish thoughts his brain and bosom fill; And shew the bitter grief and melancholy Resulting from a wild pursuit of folly. Come! Is the notion goodâwhat do you say? Fancy. Our soul's in armsâ All. And eager for the play. SongâFollyââRataplan.â Such a plan, such a plan, such a plan, plan, plan, Such a plan must turn out all right; So I'll set about my task at once, and commence this very night: This young man, this young man, this young man, man, man, Must be taught a lesson slight; I'll make his present dark, so that his future may be bright! As Milwood, I Will charm his eye, And captive lead his sense; And I'll dress, And confess That I love, Far above That poor youth, all the universeâyes. Chorus. âSuch a plan, &amp;c. (Ballet march off up platformâFolly, Claptrap, Fancy and Romance sink through four front traps to Chorus)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene Second. âParlour at Thoroughgood's. (1st grooves) A handsome Apartment; in Old English style. Enter six Sempstesses, sewing and singing, L., 1 E. Air, âSo Early in the Morning.â Sew early in the morning, Sew early in the morning, Sew early in the morning, Before the break of day. Enter Thoroughgood, L. 1 E. Thoro. Work on my busy bees and hive the honey, Remember, you've the work and hI've the money, Oh, well may England glory in her shops, Although the H perchance, at times, I drops; Or, from not being over-crammed with nous, Put it where it is quite super-flu-ous; Still, have I not a shop that's worth a plumâ I beg its pardon, an empori-um? Am I not known to be extremely well off; Have been for twenty years about to sell off; Have been about retiring from the trade; Have âmost alarming sacrificesâ made; At seeming swindles boldly made a dash; Have bought up bankrupt stock with ready cash, And here Jack Thoroughgood defiant stands, Like Briareus, âlord of a hundred hands.â Exit Sempstresses, singing, R., the same air. Bless you, my children, can't repress a tear. Enter Maria, L. 1 E., with a skipping rope. Maria (L.) Good morning, dear papa. Thoro. Good day, my dear. (aside) Heâhem! now for it. (aloud) Daughter, I'll engage, You've often thought about your marriage. Has none made no impression on your heart? My sweet, my very sweet one, why thus tart? I for your hand have had no end of proffers. Maria. (L.) It is but for my coffers they make offers. Thoro. (R.) The Baron Billiardsâif you'd higher get, That foreign swell, the Duke de Lansquenetâ I thought such splendid titles, dear, would stun youâ Lord Lollipop is very sweet upon you. Maria. He's but a boy! Thoro. He's one of the he'-lite! Maria. He's but eighteen! Thoro. Of course, so he's d'sweet (dixhuite). Maria. Papa, papa, forgive me if you please, But I can't marry any one of these. Thoro. If any villain hath entrapped your heart, he Must be a very eligible party: For you may starve, this matter I am terse on, If you should wed a pauper or pore-per-son! Maria. (aside) Alas! De Barnwell's nothing but his name. Enter Trueman, R. 1 E. (a cringing fellow), and stands eyeing Maria. Thoro. (C.) What is your infinitesimal game? Maria. (aside, L.) Trueman, that dreadful persecuting pest! True. (R.) I've merely come to make a small request. Thoro. Trueman, your manner I don't understand. True. (crossing to Maria) I've come to ask you for your daughter's hand. (Maria laughs) I was prepared for ridicule and jibing. Thoro. (R.) My faithful Trueman, have you been imbibing? True. (passionately) Yes, at a draught which burns my heart much more Than prime old fruity port at twenty-four; Which doth my bosom scorch like living coalâ A sherry cobbler working at my soul. Maria. (L.) A small request, indeed, my hand you call. True. (taking it) I do indeed, sweet maid, extremely small. Maria. (pleased) Trueman polite. True. (passionately) That think ye none can beâ None save De Barnwell? (Maria startsâchord in orchestra) Thoro. (crosses to centre) What! you don'tâhas she? No, no! and yet as closer I descry her, How shrinks Maria now as I more eye her! (clutches her hand severely) Say, do you love him? is this statement true? Speak, girl! Maria. (L.) I does. True. (R.) Ha, ha! She does! Thoro. (C.) She do! Was it for this with love that ne'er diminished I sent you to a school to be well finished? The terms were just a hundred pounds a yearâ Some of the ologies come very dearâ With extras that suggested thoughts of ruin. Twelve towels and a silver fork and spoo-in. What shall I do? oh! tell me, worthy Trueman? True. Bestow on me the hand of the young wooman. Thoro. Never! you must have dined, presumptuous T.; My daughter weds not with the likes of thee. True. This my return for all the things I've done. Who helped you up the golden heights you've won? Who but the wretch on whom you are so hard Taught you the tricks of trade, and on the card On which was nineteen shillings boldly placed, A faint elevenpence three farthings traced With light lead pencil in the corner? Who Declared the summer before last's silks were new? Who vowed through thick and thin when you were brought Up for intimidation to the court That you were out of town? You know that I In a near court, swore to an alley by. Thoro. My observations hurts his feelings, pain 'em, And as his tears are pure, he don't restrain 'em; Trueman, she's yours, as partners I'll take you, And you, Maria, 'll be his partner too. (joins their hands) Maria. Never! Maria's firmness you'll discover. Partner! to think of partn' her from her lover, I'll die a spinster rather, you shall see! Thoro. (C.) If so, you'll be of great ex pince ter me. TrioââWhole hog or none.â Thoro. You well know when once I say a thing, I always have it done, I've a knack of going on, you are aware, when I've begun; To a vagabondish creditor, I'm a remorseless dun, With a disobedient child I'll go the whole hog or none! Maria. Oh la, pa! think of matrimony With a horrid wretch like Trueman, Wouldn't be a bit of fun! Oh! if to him! I'm bound, I'll go the whole hog or none. (all repeat in chorus, and dance off to symphony, L. 2 E.)</field>

Shopmen behind counters serving Customers; Mauve Magenta, the shop-walker, is parading the shop; all old fashioned; scene bustling and lively. MusicâAir, âMarket Chorus, Masaniello.â Mauve. (to Old Lady, R.) Madam, I trust our goods give satisfaction? Old Lady. They don't, and I intend to bring an action, That farthingale I bought last week is soiled, Spotted with grease I find, completely spoiled. Mauve. To kick up any breeze is no avail, A penny breeze about a farthingale; It's meanâ(returns parcel, and to another Lady, L.) I hope you've found, ma'am, what you wish? Our Lady. (snappishly) Certainly not, your goods are all rubbish; You haven't got the coloured silk I want. (going) Mauve. (interupting her) Good gracious! yes, we have, depend upon't. Come in, give trouble, go and not buy anything, Not so much as the value of a penny thing. You call yourself a lady. (she seizes a roll of calico from counter, L.) What, defied! And by a womanâWalker! Lady. Stand aside! (knocks him down into the arms of a Shopman and exit, C., followed by all other Customers grumbling) Mauve. Defeated! Some poor wretch shall feel my powerâ That George de Barnwell has been out an hour! Shopman. See, sir, he comes with slow and measured paces, Full of reflective thoughtfulness his face is. Mauve. (aside) I like him notâhe trying for my place is. MusicâEnter George de Barnwell, C., thoughtfully; he carries a parcel and yard measure. Mauve. And so, sir, you've come back, Barn. (looking up) I have returned. Mauve. How were you treated by the Countess? Barn. (with animation) Spurned! I up the flaunting flight of steps did mount, To ask the Countess for her small account; She heard and laughed at me, while three or four Huge pampered menials thrust me from the door, And as I down the sharps steps flying came Grazed the more nubbly portions of my frame. (Shopmen go up and laugh) They little know the man they kicked contains, Aristocratic fluid in his veins! That he who down the stone stairs flying went, Could really boast of a most high descent; De Barnwell, whose poor nose is scraped and sore! Traces his lineage from the Konkey-raw! Silence, ambitious boy! These grinning knavesâ These sniggering servile sycophantic slavesâ These counter-skipping varlets, here who know Nothing beyond their silk and calico, Don't understand thee. Keep poetic fervour For times when you're alone, with no observer! Meanwhile the bade, the counter-yard and shelf. Heart, heart look inwardsâfeed upon thyself! (blows his nose with emotion) Mauve. The guv'nor! (Shopmen skip to their places) Enter Thoroughgood, Maria, and Trueman, R. 1 E. Thoro. Friends, all work and no play Makes Jack a dull boy; so a holiday, I beg to give you. Go forth, happy be, Heâhem, and don't return till after tea. Mauve. A cheer for Thoroughgood! Thoro. Oh, no! All. Hurray! Barn. I'm not quite well, at home I'd rather stay, As for the rest they may accept the boon. Your custom always of an afternoon Is rather slack. At home I'd rather stop, For solitude I loveâand mind the shop. True. (aside, L.) And with the shop his eye, for I shall watch him, And if in anything suspicious cotch him, Let him beware. Maria. Dear George. Thoro. Come, girl, don't pout. (to Shopmen) You'd better sing a chorus and get out. Concerted Piece.ââZip Coon.â Thoro. Cut away, lads and lasses, to this hop skip tune. True. Cut away for time presses, 'twill be evening soon. Thoro. Never mind George de Barnwell, he's a melancholy spoon. Barn. I prefer to stop in here, sir, the entire afternoon. Thoro. What, all the afternoon? Barn. (faintly) Yes, all the afternoon. All. What, all the afternoon? Barn. Yes, all the afternoon. I'm never very jolly, And this afternoon, it's true, I feel more melancholy Than I usually do. All (repeat) Cut away, lads, &amp;c., &amp;c. (the Shopmen dance off, C., Thoroughgood and Maria, R.âTrueman follows them with tragic strides, with his eyes fixed on De Barnwell) Barn. Down to a counter brought, oh, sad disgrace! Is this the last of the De Barnwell race? I, who've a throbbing and ambitious soul The strongest waistcoat buttons can't control. Maria loves me, but I must look higher; I like Maria, but I can't marry her! 'Twill break her heart.âNo matter, I have seen My soul's adored, heart's idol, fancy's queen! 'Twas in the pit tier that I first did meet her; I thought I never saw a pittier creature. I called her carriage, as she left the lobby, Although I was pushed backwards by a bobby; I saw she smiled on me, than Romeo madder, Ever since then I've been her living shadder, Her wild adorer, her entranced lov-er; Round her I hover, thinking always hof-her. SongâAir, âCottage by the Sea.â By the waving sea we'd wander, Gaze on the expansive blue; On the perriwinkle ponder, Catching crabs and starfish too. If she'd marry me to-morrow, We'd retire and blissful be; But there's no chance of my getting A cottage by the sea. AirââShip's Carpenter.â I have followed her carriage, And have waited in vain To see her get in it, Sometimes in the rain; But what is the wet when your bosom's on fire? And mud makes no difference when you ad-mire Such a diddle, daddle, doodle chip chop, &amp;c. I feel a little weary, and methinks I may as well indulge in forty winks; When waking, I'm so poor that people scoff, But when I'm once asleep I feel well off; Against this counter short, I feel so small, In fact, I may say no account at all. Oh, dearâ(sleeps on chair, L.) MusicâEnter Lady Milwood, from behind statue, R.U.E. Milwood. I want to look at some Chantilly lace. There seems to be no shopman in the place! (stamps her foot) Barn. (awakes and rises) I'm the assistant. Milwood (aside) No, it cannot be. It is! Barn. (aside) It is! Milwood. It isâ'tis he! Barn. 'Tis she! DuetââThere is a young Woman.â Barn. It is the young woman who has such a s[illeg.] Cast over the fortunes of George de Barnwell Wag a tye, ah, Than Mari ah, Alas! this young lady is lovelier far. Milwood. Oh, please, sir, how is it, explain if you please, The reason I find you on these premi-ses. Barn. A Braggart I are, In fact a li-ar, I'm assistant, that's all, to this haberdash-ar. Milwood. Your noble appearance has taken me in, Barn. (aside) That's a hint, George de Barnwell, to go in and win. Wag a tye air, Madam, a chair, Deserving alone are the brave of the fair. (Goes behind counter and nervously piles up goods) What can I show you handsome and expensive? Our stock of summer silks is most extensive. (aside) She smiles, she loves me, oh, despair, distraction! (aloud) These silks from Spitalfields give satisfaction. They're cheap since the decline and fallânot Gibbon's,â But of the weaversâlovely thing in ribbons. (aside) Her beauteous eyes surpass all other women's, With love I'm mad! Is it delirium? trimmings! Milwood. Excuse me, sir, if I appear to be, Impelled by vulgar curiosity, But though a shopman's boldness you appear To ape, you wer'nt born for the shopman's sphere. Barn. Mum, the De Barnwellsâ Milwood (rising and aside) Oh, enchanting name. Barn. With Will the Conqueror to England came, Though poor we're passing proudâas for the rest, Our birth is noble, and unstained our crest. Milwood. There is a lordly presence in your eye! Barn. Which, mum? Milwood. In bothâthat seemeth to defy The frowns of fortune; say, is this not trueâ Doth not De Barnwell dross despise? Barn. (proudly) He do! Milwood. You are romantic! Barn. Rather! Milwood. And a poet! You wrote these linesâyour mantling blush doth shew it. (produces pamphlet) Barn. Allow me! Milwood. Nayâwith it I ne'er will part; For weeks and weeks I've worn them next my heart. (reads in trembling accents) âYe who would look the nobly born, I vow, sirs, At once try Thoroughgood's twelve shilling trowsers; The cut, and the material must please, They never become baggy at the knees; The price twelve shillings, which but double six isâ Twelve shillings for the Montmorency kicksies.â How charmingly expressed! Barn. They're rather choice. Milwood. I knew so by the accents of your voice; There's a melodious cadence in its tones, So different from those of Mr. Jones, Who generally serves me when I come. Barn. (raturously) Thrice happy Jones! I beg your pardon, mum. Milwood. Nay, I'm not offended, but time presses, And I have not selected the new dresses. It ne'er has been my lot to meet with yetâ Sir, your attentions I can ne'er forget. (she takes his handâhe appears thrilled at the touch) Farewell! Barn. Lady, our summer silks are stunning, stayâ Milwood. It's getting late, and what might people say. Barn. (conceitedly) Precisely so. Milwood. The world's so merciless. I find it difficult to choose a dressâ I will, with your permission, take 'em all. (sweeps up a great pile of goods) And if at my address you'll kindly callâ (Barnwell starts and supports himself by chair) What ails you? Barn. (dreamily) N-nothing. Milwood. Something surely, sir. Barn. Nothing at allâand I shall call on her! DuetââLucia.â Milwood. 'Tis late growing, There's no knowing What folks may say at my stopping; Hints be dropping, On my shopping At so late an hour you know. Barn. Direful thoughts my breast are filling, I, poor fool, ain't worth a shilling, I feel such an awful âWilling,â Agony, despair and woe! Milwood. Now farewell, for I must go! Barn. Oh! oh! oh! oh! Milwood. Oh! oh! oh! oh! Now farewell, &amp;c. Exit Milwood, C. Barn. (R.) It's no use. Gracious! what is this I see? Young Wilkins in his desk has left his key; I've but to turn the lockâoh, Milwood! Milwood! It is for thee De Barnwell rob the till would. The cover of the desk once lifted, I'd Immediately desk over what's inside. (opens it) Cheques! notes, and guineas! and a bank post bill! The shop with all its faults, I love its till. (pockets the money) Now to my tailor quickâaway, away; My soul's in arms, and eager for theâ (rushing out) Enter Trueman, R.; abruptly seizes him. True. Stay! Stay, stay, your manner something wrong betrays; Barn. Think you to hold me with a pair of stays? True. A pair of stays! Your station you forget; Barn. Bother! I've done with you and your course set! True. Corset and stay, my bosom friend and pally, Your manner's too much of the lacey alley! (seizes Barnwell) Drop that till-gotten wealth; your plans I'll spoil, And the designs of guilt on that tin foil; I watched the whole proceedingâ'twas a bold 'unâ Through the keyholeâ Barn. Indeed! Now hark'e, old un: I'm desperate! there! (Musicâbreaks from him, and seizes an enormous pair of scissors from R. counter) Ha, what a pair of fizzers! There, there, and thereâthere, there, and there! (stabs him six times) True. (falls) Oh, scissors! Barn. Thus perish those who'd thwart me in my mission, Or seek to curb my towering ambition! (wipes scissors on Trueman's coat) True. Oh, trait'rous dog! Barn. Shut up! (hits him on the head; he drops as dead) What have I done? He breathesâah, yes, he must! (kneels beside him) No breathânot one! I must away. Musicâcreeps towards door, C.; Trueman rises, seizes him, turns him round, and struggles to counter, R.; seizes Watchman's rattle, which he springs. Enter Thoroughgood with napkin tucked under his chin, as if he had been interrupted at dinner, followed by Maria, R. 1 E. Thoro. (C.) Trueman! what means this riot? Stuck! True. By De Barnwell. Thoro. (going to seize him) Scoundrel! Barn. Don't you try it. True. He's robbed the till, and me he's tried to kill. Barn. Villain! I rob the till, beast! (crosses to him) True. Yes, Barn. (strikes him) Be still! Concerted piece, âBilly Patterson.â Barn. He who attempts to lay finger on me, Or of old Baily pattersâonâ His fate disagreeable and speedily will be. True. He did kill me! he did kill me! Maria. Oh, George de Barnwell, pray, Oh, George, don't go away; My heart will break I know; Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! Barn.

Enter the Uncle, reading newspaper. Uncle. Well, from these columns the stern fact I cull, That, taken altogether, things are dull. For, as Jack Gong observeth, in my line âThings is werry much upon the declineââ No student, now, I own it to my sorrow, Takes to that interesting author âBorrowââ No briefless barrister, who sporteth oak, For coal makes free with his Black-stone or Cokeâ No hard-up poet pining for a supper, For a small trifle wildly spouts his Tupperâ Few now seek the assistance of the shop, The very weasels have ceased going âpop.â If things continue long to look so blue, And business doesn't take a turn, I do; And in the grounds of my surburban villa, Of trade in order to steer clear, turn tiller, With spade in hand plant flower, tree, and twig, And thus enjoy my otium cum dig, And never shrink from moderate expense In wages, and in gardening implements, Till gravelled, bedded, turfed, well smoothed and lawned, Is this pawnbroker's garden in Balls pawn'd. SongââOld English Gentleman.â I've got a villa out of town, a villa of two floors, Approached by a new avenue of fine young sycamores, With two brass plates, I decorates the bells at the front doors, The one is labelled âServants,â and the other âVisitors.â Like a fine old British pawnbroker one of the modern time. I've chandeliers that drop glass tears, and cost this child a few, And carpets upon which I'm quite afraid to put my shoe, And cart loads of fine furniture that smells extremely new, For everything is redolent of happiness and glue. At this fine old British pawnbroker's, &amp;c. I've got a butler clad in black, it's evident to see, Although he's heavy wages, that he don't think much of me, I've got a foreign cook whose dishes with me disagree, A fashionable doctor, too, whose homÅopathee Will kill this British pawnbroker, &amp;c. Enter R. D. in flat, a hideous Shopboy. Shopboy. A lady, which her name she will not tell, But which, I think, she is a tip-top swellâ Leastways, her manners is both proud and haughtyâ Is in the shop. Uncle. Show up the female porty. Exit Shopboy. All soft roads to my heart must I Macadam, The shopman's sternness summon. Walk in, madam! Enter Milwood veiled, R. D. in flat. I think I know her veil. Milwood. (R.) If that's the case, Then it's of no avail to hide my face. (removes her veil) Uncle. Your ladyship! Can I believe my eyes? Milwood. The fact is, I perceive, you advertise To those who for a time hard up may be, That you lend cash on good security, And though my fortune's ample, some delay in Collecting rentsâmy tenants all hate paying. Uncle. You to your uncle come for an advance 'Cos of the backwardness of your ten-ants. Milwood. Preciselyâthen the failure of a bank, And the extravagant demands of rank Compel me toâin short, to clear the case, What will you lend me on this silk and lace? The lace you see is point, and plenty of it. Uncle. The only point I look at, mum, is profit. Of course a man must live, and there's you see, Unfortunately, a good deal of me. (aside) She seems to me to shun my observa-shun. (aside) Where did you get this lace? Milwood. From a relace-ion. Uncle. Impossible! I must repeat, mum, where? This is Chantilly. Milwood. I shan't tellee, there! Uncle. This a case, mumâinstantly I twigged itâ Of kleptomaniaâthat's to say, you prigged it! The label, see, of Thoroughgood and Co. Milwood. The label; it's a libel! Uncle. Oh, dear no. You've given way, it's very plain to see, My pretty lass, to petty larceny. Where's the police! you're guilty and shall rue it; I must call the police. Milwood. P-lease don't do it. Upon my knees I fall. Uncle. (aside) Which shows that she Admits that it's a case of fell-on-knee. Police! You've tasted pleasure, now you'll sup Most bitter cup, and you must be took up. Milwood. Rather than that, I'll take a fatal âheader.â (going to window, L. in flat) Uncle.

(aloud) Your ladyship, say but the word, And you're as free as any ocean bird; If I make free 'tis but to make you free; Your only chance, mum, is to marry me. Milwood. Villain! but no, the notion's too absurd; Marry a pawnbroker! Upawn my word! Pray recollect the distance 'tween us two, I came to âpopâ myself and not hear you. Uncle. Reflect; I've got a handsome modern willa, A spacious cellar and no end of siller; Mine is a rather enviable lot, I keep a brougham and a chari-ot; Be mine, they're yours; if not, a jail expect. Milwood. Oh, agony! time give me to reflect. Uncle. To-morrow morning, after breakfastâ Milwood. Oui. Oh never shall the sun that morrow see! I, Lady Milwood, stoop to such as he; A very stoopid sort of thing 'twould be; I, one of England's aristocra-cee! 'Tis here, but not engenderedâGeorge de B.

To-night some profit I may hope to get, Miraculous to say, it isn't wet; I've had these gardens open now three months, And had it fine, I may say, scarcely once; For my directorship it's very plain, Is what one calls a managerial reign. Enter Fastman, smoking, L. Fast. Halloa, old boy! Lessee. I hope I see you well! Fast. That fellow on the trapÃ©ze is a sell! Lessee. You don't mean that he's been and gone and fell? How he's kept on so long I can't divine; I hope he's not broke anythingâof mine. Fast. Oh! he's a deal too careful, man, to fall, And that's what I complain of. Lessee. Oh, that's all! Fast. Of course, if he'd create a great sensation, The acrobat must take a lofty station, Sight-seers love a highly seasoned dish; In fact, were you to take them at their wish, They'd have the trapeze swing athwart the sky. It's dangerous game, and people like it high; And if you want my tin, likewise, my pals, Give us a ballet, man, and lots of gals. Lessee. We'll see about it. Fast. Do so, and look here, We think your shilling supper dooced dear, Drop it to sixpence and throw in some beer. Lessee. Then how am I to pay. Fast. Oh, bother that! Your entertainment, like your Bass, is flat; Your shows are only fit for cads or tars, And nothing draws, not even your cigars. Lessee. Anything else you'd like me, sir, to do? Fast.

Barnwell sits at it) This banquet's not what one might term a ch'ice 'unâ This tea is not enticin', it ain't hyson; The butter's salt, the bread like me is sad, The water creases ain't so very bad. I think I might consume two more such piecesâ I really find my appetite in creases.

This blunderbuss's contents you I'll lodge inâ Your'e fixed, my friend, and so it's no use dodging! You've prigged my pears, ha! ha! there's no escape! My apples, tooânow you shall taste my grape! Maria (falls on knees, C.) Mercy! it is my father! Thoro. (R.) Yes, it's meâThoroughgood, Hosier, ten hundred and three, Tot'nam Court-road! Uncle. What are you doing, there, in that enclosure? Who'd think, 'midst apple-trees, to find an osier! (Servants release Thoroughgood, and exit, L. Thoro. Oh, sir, De Barnwell! Uncle. What, my nevvy, oh! Thoro. Gone! Uncle. Oh, this is indeed a nevvy blow (all take out pocket handkerchiefs) Trio, âJohnny was a shoemaker,â Thoro. That George de B. was to make her, His wife was understood; But he's gone alack, And I fear he won't come back; Though he's certainly not gone for good-ood-ood. Maria. That apprentice to a hosi-er, Behaved most shamefullee; For the heartless sinner, Run away, just after dinner, And he never came back to his tea ee-ee. Uncle. Bound him 'prentice to a haberdash-er. Did I. My handkerchief You'll give back some Of the heavy premi-um. We'll go inside and give way to grief eef-eef. (all exit in house) Music, âThe Wolf.ââEnter Barnwell, R., in the dress of a Coburg Bandit, black ringlet wig, russet boots, gauntlets, and large buckle in his belt which is studded with knives; combat sword. Barn. To nerve me to the deed so dark and vile, I've togged myself in the old Coburg style; Thus have I seen transpontine villains stride, (imitates melodramatic style) Thus have I seen them enemies deride; (laughs in same manner) Thus with a voice that's well up in the throat, Have heard them growl âIn cell beneath the moat, Load them with chains and manacles, you he-ar, Ha, ha! Remorsolino knows no fear.â Where are my weapons? I've sufficient knives, Ay, âif the slave had forty thousand lives; My great revenge has stomach for them all,â He comes!âhere goes to make short work of Paul. Enter Uncle with watering pot from house. Uncle. (L.) Heigho! to keep my spirits up I'll try; George. (R.) Excuse me, but terembleâalso die. Uncle. Who are you? George. What, who am I? as for that aâ I amâ Uncle. You areâ George. I am, ha, ha! no matter; Just have the kindness please, to take your fate. Music.âFences with the Uncle who guards himself with the watering pot, which has a very long spoutâGeorge rubs his sword along the spout after manner of minor theatre combatants, and leaves off to wipe his brow. The fight is renewed, and Barnwell falls, the Uncle pours some water on him and he revives; fights on one knee, drives Uncle to L. garden chair, on which he sinks. Now die. Uncle. You wouldn't hit me when I'm down? Barn. Of course I wouldâhere goes! (sticks him) Oh, Uncle Brown! I didn't go to do it! Here! it's I, Your nephew George! He's killed, by George! don't die. I only meant with just a prod to drill him! He is my uncle! Oh! I can't un-kill him. It's all that dreadful creature Milwood's doing; She wrought my ruin! Enter Millwood through vampire in flat suddenlyâ tremulous music through this. Milwood. What, the deed your rueing, Your sorry for it, eh?âYou'd gladly be Once more the poor apprentice, happy, free From silly notions foreign to your station; In fact you'd like your former situation, Maria's loveâ Barn. Don't torture me, I see Policeman eighteen hundred sixty-three! With Bluchers for a Brodignagian meet, And elephantine boots on his poor feet! His blood-shot bull's-eye glares from it's deep socket; He pulls the cruel handcuffs from his pocket! (kneelsâtearing off wig and robber's dress) Mercy! take that and thatâthere, there, and there! I'm guilty!âcollar me!âDespair, despair! (falls helplessly on the ground on his face) Milwood. Enoughâthe spell 'tis full now time to break, First, though, my form original I'll take. (music.âher dress of Milwood vanishes, and Folly appears in its place) Quick, George de Barnwell, from your dream awake! (touches himâhe looks up) Barn. Where am I? Enter Thoroughgood, Trueman, and Maria, from house L. Thoro. There he isâmy boyâmy 'prentice! Uncle. My nevvy! Maria. George! Barn. What, am I compos mentis? Thoro. My dear de Barnwell, you've been out all night. Barn. What, uncle, ain't you dead then? Uncle. No, not quite. Barn. Where's Lady Milwood? Folly. Married, now forget her. The least you say about all this the better. Let bygones bygones be, your dream is past, We'll hope that the impression, though, will last, And that the moral we've to-night conveyed Will be of a fast colour, and not fade. Maria. Why, you've been walking in your sleep, what fun! Uncle. Let's hope the walk may finish in a run. Barn. Forgiven, thankee; you'll forgive me too, Your hands alone, you know, can pull me through. De Barnwell's going into business, and He asks your favours, thusâyou understand? He needs naught else his future path to bless If you'll stamp this night's vision a success. Finale.ââHot Cod[illeg.]ings.â Folly. The dreadful condition Maria. To which is brought Uncle. The sort of ambition Barn. One didn't ought Maria. To flourish, we to-night have shown, In language not at all high flown. Folly. Then smile on our absurditee. Let George de Barnwell happy be. Thus us jolly make, our folly take, As you've very often done at Christmas time, oh! All. Thus us folly make, &amp;c. (all sink through traps during chorus)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Duet, âBlue Bells of Scotland.â Thoro. Oh, where! and oh, where! is my poor apprentice flown? Maria. He has fled from his indentures, left me to sob and groan, Thoro. I'd soon be down upon him if his whereabouts were known. Maria. He's broken my poor heart, burst soon it will. Thoro. He's broken his indentures and my till; Prigged my point lace, and other things as fine, Cut from his articles with lots of mine. Maria (clutching his arm) Look! look! I see him dancing in the hall! Ha! ha! Thoro. (R.) Alas! she's madâsad sight for me to view, Since he's gone off she has gone off it too. Maria (sings) âGood morrow, it is St. Valentine's day! Up in the morning be times.â Father! Thoro. My child! Maria (sings) âI am a perfect cure.â (dancesâgun fires) Oh, agony! what have I been and done? Thoro. You've been and gone and trod on a spring gun, You're always coming across some mishap. Oh! (screams) I've been and gone and trod on a steel trap. Murder! police! (Music)</field>
