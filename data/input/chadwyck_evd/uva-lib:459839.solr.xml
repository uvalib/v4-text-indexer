      <field name="fulltext">THE Great Favourite, Or, the DUKE OF LERMA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue To the Duke of Lerma, spoken by Mr s. Ellen, and Mr s. Nepp. Nepp. How, Mrs. Ellen, not drest yet, and the Play ready to begin. El. Not so near ready to begin as you think for. Nepp. Why, What's the matter? Ellen. The Poet, and the Company are wrangling within. Nepp. About what? Ellen. A Prologue. Nepp. Why, Is't an ill one. Nell. Two to one it had been so if he had writ any, but the Conscious Poet, with much modesty, and very Civilly and Sillilyâhas writ none. Nepp. What do they meane to do? Nell. Nay, Fortune knowes, They are now Compounding with him but for two lines. Nepp. And what sayes the wilfull Rhymer? Nell. Why he sayes for his defence, that Prologues are like Corne well thrash'd, there's nothing left in the Straw. Nepp. What shall we do then? 'Slife, let us be bold, And speak a Prologue.â Nell. âNo, no, let us Scold. Knepp. Nayâ Since to be try'd here is our Poets Chance, Wee'l wish him sure a good Deliverance. Nelle. Why, then deliver him from you that sit And boldly Censure, what, you have not Wit: May you be poor, and know not what to do For Six pence, and then rail at Money too. Nepp. From you that have some Wit, and yet more Spight, May you be judg'd, as you do those that write; May all your Courted Mistresses to you Prove froward and malitious Critiques too. Nell. May they observe with care your ugliest Looks As you do the worst things in Plays and Books. Nepp. Deliver him from you that nothing spare; Nay, you that would fain seem worse then you are, Out-talke your own Debaucheries, and tell With a fine shrug, Faith Jack I am not well Nell. From you that with much ease, and little shame Can blast a Poet's, and a Woman's fame; For at first sight a well-bred trick y'have got Combing your Wiggs, to Cry, Damme She's naught. Nepp. Prithee let's say no more, but run away, For they'le revenge themselves on the poore Play. Nell. No matter, we have here one Party fast, I meane the Gentlemen we spoke of last: Though they deny't the Poet, yet we know, On'us they freely wou'd their Claps bestow. Exeunt.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue Spoken by Mr s. Ellen. Much injur'd Gentlemen, may you now please, You true Committee of such Grievances, Kindly to hear me now, and I will show it, We have been all ill us'd, by this days Poet. 'Tis our joynt Cause; I know you in your hearts Hate serious Plays, as I do serious Parts, To trouble us with Thoughts and State-designs, A melancholly Plot ty'd with strong Lines, I had not the least Part to day you see, Troth, he has neither writ for you, nor me; You are not har'd to please; though a Poet scarce Can make a Play, yet he might make a Farce, With small ridiculous things to stuff it full And make you pay to laugh, not to be dull. Henceforth, against all sad and Grave intreagues We'll make Offensive, and Defensive Leagues; And for all those that dare write Tragedy We'll make a Law, with a huge Penalty; And yet few Poets, so much Wealth possess, Or Witt; where you might Leavy a Distress; Let the Grave Poets then trouble but few Write Elegies on men, which few men knew, And few perhaps will read; or let 'em write Rhimes for the Bell man, to be spoke at night. This Poet may be pardon'd, lest it be said You did condemn before the Law was made; I mean, if's Play be good, I tell you True, He thinks it is, but pray now, what think you. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. Scene I. Enter Lerma, Alone. Ler. Repulse upon repulse; like Waves thrown back, That slide to hang upon obdurate Rocks; The King shot Ruine at me, and there lies, Forgiving all the world, but me alone; As if that Heaven too, as well as he, Had scratcht me out of numbers; at the Last He turn'd his feeble eyes away from me, As dying men from sins, that had misled 'em, Blasting my hopes, and theirs that hang upon me: Thus all those mighty Merits of my Family, Are going to his Grave, there to be buryed; And I my self have hung upon his frowns, Like dew upon a Cloud, till shaken off In a cold showre, and frozen as it fell, Starving my growth, with this untimely frost: But,âI fondly prate away my thoughts Till I have made 'em nothing, like my self. Enter Pedro, Lorenzo, Jaques, Paulo, and Caldroon his Servants. Seeâhere are the parts of my full Ruine, These decay'd out-houses shew the chief building Wants Reparation. A good day May you all share my friends, and better too Then Lerma's best, or 'twill be dark enough. Pedro. What means this Salutation? Loren. I understand it not. Ler. What? all struck dumb? has then the news Of Lerma's late Repulse; from Mighty Philip Wrought such effects upon your shaken spirits, Who are but play-fellows with my decays, That it hath ravish'd from you all your tongues, (Afflictions best Appeasers) he that's boldest Let him attempt to talke, me up to slight it, And he that's fearful, Let him pitty me; For I have thanks for every sort of kindness, Nay, for your looks; I see a sorrow there, For which Lerma has nothing left to give you, But that poor empty name of Thanks, a word That pays for faint salutes, or a good morrow. Cald. My Lord, we were commanded, at this hour Here to attend your pleasure: Ler. 'Tis true, I had forgot, I call'd you to confess, I am your debtor And you my patient Creditors, Pen, Ink, and Paper there; and now my friends I'le tell you all the fortune I have left, And you shall shar't, as far as it will go Ex. Paulo, for Pen, Ink, &amp;c. How long, Pedro, hast thou serv'd me? Ped. Seven years, my Lord. Ler. Dost thou not curse me now for want of wages? In such A'prentiship, with great Medina Thou hadst set up thy self; thy tedious service Has now no more Inheritance, then a loose Ragg About a hang'd-up Man, consuming with The shameful Carcass it should cover. Omnes. We do beseech your Lordship. Ler. I apprehend you: all I can do, is this: Let every man Examine his own wishes The aptness of his own abilities, and see The Man, how great to e're, (the King excepted) In reach of whose great fires I dare not trust, My wither'd Supplications) And to him I will with all the liberal praise I can Give him a fair preferment, Omn. We wish no other choice, but as we are. Ler. No more; your kindness is Ill-tim'd. That Paper waits for your Impressions And I to finish your desires, peruse it. He walks about while they write. Soânay grieve not, this is a day Of your most happy changesâ (he Reads Let me seeâPedro to Don Bruchero, 'tis well Jaques, the Duke d'Alva; good, Lorenzo, The Duke of Anzon, in Naples, fit, Paulo, To Don Lewis de Velasco, very well,â Who for the Wars then? Ped. I, my good Lord. Ler. 'Tis a good choiceâbut stay, what's this, At last? sure I mistake. Read it Pedro. Ped. Roderigo del Caldroon, and the Marquis of Lerma. Ler. Ha, ha, ha, I was not then mistaken In him, though in the Rest. (aside. Cald. I hope your Lordship, never shall have cause To alter your good thoughts, of your poor servant. Ler. Thou'st took a course to make thee poor enough; But e're we part, I must say something to thee. For you Gentlemen, you may assure your selves You shortly shall possess your several choices: I dare not wish you well, lest my desires As in my own successes, fail in yours, Yet all the parts of good, that are not dangerous Your miserable Lord will pay you: now go in, I'le follow presently; in the mean time, I'le try to turn poor Roderigo's Love More to his proper use. Omn. Heaven crown you with success. Exeunt. Ler. See Caldroon, how my infected fate Has driven these to seek more healthful Ayrs. But why dost thou dote on my misery, Thus to persue a death, that would flie from thee, Or Lov'st thou to grow old in poverty, Hurrying thy fortune on, before 'tis ready, And making my ill Fate, Conscious of thine. By Heaven, unless some Holy Nunnery, Receive my dear Maria, I have not means Left to preserve her: of my self I'm grown more careless now, then others are: Cald. My Lord, I never follow'd any hopes of yours, Nor vow'd my self a servant to your fortunes; I only beg, I may not be discarded Before you see some tryal of my faith. Ler. Thou dost engage me in new wars Caldroon, For I am urg'd by gratitude to thee, To tugg agen with froward destiny, That I may ravish mighty favours from her To throw in showres upon thee; but consider, Art thou resolv'd to try this chance with me? Cald. In spight of Injury, and Fate, my Lord. Ler. Our Contract then is seal'dâbut no more, See, some servants of the King, stand close. Enter Don Francisco and Don Juan. Don Juan. Good day Francisco, how fares the King? Fran. Ill enough, I fear, for even now I met Physitians, and some of his bed-chamber Who had this time the watch about his person; By them I heard, he had a cruel night. Don Ju. Made they a question then of his Recovery? Fran. No, For they said it was impossible. Ler. The weather alters. aside. Don. Ju. Of what nature may his disease be? Fran. Physitians are pleas'd to tell us, that After the Patient's dead: 'tis supposed To be of a strange Nature; if bloody men May draw down vengeance; Heaven seems To send a portion of his Anger on him Ler. Revenge my Quarrel, little Mighty people. aside. Fran. 'Tis dangerous to talk: At St. Merceds 'Twixt Nine and Ten Ile meet you. D. Juan. I will not fail: Farewell. (Exeunt severally. Ler. Grow up you Blessed Ministers of Anger And turn the giddy Court into Distractions, And let Great Philip die, as loath'd as Poverty Or as his own diseaseâha! more distraction? Enter two or three, running hastily with Lights; Physitians and Fryers another way, and every way Noble-men with Torches before them, as the Duke d'Alva, Marquess of Alcara, and Count Bruchero. Cald. This strange confusion tells the news of death. Ler. My heart is wing'd, and soars, I know not whither. aside. D' Alva. Call the Florentine Doctor. 1. Lord. H'as watcht three nights, and is stoln hence to Rest. Alca. Where's that Florentine and the Confessor? 2. Lord. Not in the Court. Ler. Now it heightens. aside. Alca. Not in Court? Has the Impostor then leisure to sleep When Spains Great Majesty lies so afflicted? Go raise him up, and bid him waken nature, That almost now is in a dying sleep: Hark, I fear the fatal blow is struck. noise of a groan. Exeunt. Cald. Heard you not that my Lord? Ler. I heard methoughts a groan as Horrible As if Great Natures Frame had crackt in too, And yet that blow kill'd not a fly Caldroon; Something is gone Old Folkes will talke on. But see, these Faces speak a certainty; Draw near 'em. Enter two or three Courtiers. 1. Cour. The King is dead. Ler. Thanks be to Heaven. Aside. 2. Cour. He dy'd in extreame torment. Cald. Good newes my Lord. Aside. Ler. Oh Admirable! but see here's more, Stand aside. Enter the Duke of Medina, the Duke D' Alva, and the Kings Confessor, with Attendants. Medi. My Lords, 'tis fit we every'one Retire Freely, to pay our Griefes for our dead Master; In the mean time summon the Privy Council, To meet two houres henceâ In the Kings Chamber. D' Alva. Father Confessor, you must bring the Will: And Publish it at the Councel Board. Exeunt. Lerma pulls the Confessor as hee's going out. Conf. I shall not fail. Ler. Is the King dead? Conf. Too sure. Exit. Ler. I have Ideas in my head Caldroone, Thy Councel and thy Service must give life to, That holy Roabe I touch't at going off Must Sanctifie, and hide my morral thoughts, For I am very Worldly at the present. Cald. Command me, I am all yours my Lord. Ler. Then the young KingâIt will not out, But I will cleave unto the Court, Like flesh Grown up to fill the place, where 'twas cut off; I will sow Jealousie in every breast, 'Tis a Rank growing weed, and will choak up All that shou'd spring of Love, or Confidence. And thenâGood, Excellent.â Studies. My minde growes fruitful now, and brings forth thoughts Enough, to stock the World with my ambition, And like a fruitful Mother now takes care, That was before as barren as despair. Exeunt. Scene II. Enter the young King, the Queen Mother, the Duke of Medina, the Duke D' Alva, the Marquess of Alcara, Count Bruchero and the Confessor, carrying the Kings Will upon a Cushion in State. Queen. Shou'd we all stay, till we had pay'd our griefes To his dead Majesty; we shou'd neglect The Just performance of his Sacred Will. By long continu'd Sorrowes: Therefore we must Beg so much time from teares, as to fulfil, The Last commands of our Dead Sovereign. In which your Services we must command. Med. Madam, th'Affaires of Spain, Dwell in a Calme By the wise Conduct of our Dead Master: And our Last troubles in the Belgicke Warrs Backt by the English, for a time laid by; So that the breath we have from all our toyles May be Employ'd in this our Last obedience, To our Dead Sovereigne; and our future Loyalties, Perform'd to this fair Risen Sun. D' Alva. The first Visit this new Sun must make Is through the several Governments; calling all To Just Accounts, that those that have done well May be Continu'd, other Men Remov'd. Alca. Committees for that purpose, must be Impower'd. At our next meeting, and the Peoples Oathes In every Province taken for the King. Bruch. Then all the Garrisons must be survey'd, The General, Collonels, and the Captaines, Sworne By a new Oath, to their Immediate King; And all the Souldiers pay'd their full arrears. Queen. Add to this our Navies, and our Galleys, And then Embassadors to several Nations Must be next thought on, the King and I Will if he pleases go to the Escurial, Till all things are dispos'd in better order. Alca. Madam, the Marquess of Lerma, is yet in Court. Queen. To little purpose Alcara; Thats not forgot In the Kings Will, and we must blast him hence With the disdain, that by the Will's bequeath'd him. D' Alva. He is a danger alwayes where he is. Queen. The King has left us heires unto his State, And we have not forgot, the Sawcy words His Idle Spleen gave out against our Person; I'le keep him like a poison, in a glass, Till his own venome bursts him. King. Madam, I think it best, that I retire To the Escurial. Queen. If you please, Sir, till the Funeral Of your dead Fathers past, for Stars ne'r shine In Clouds: the Rest, my Lords, the King Commits to you, for safety of his Person and Affaires. Medi. It is the Boast of Spain, and our best Glories, That we have Ever, truely serv'd our Kings. Queen. 'Tis an undoubted truth: please you to go. King. I must first speak with my Confessor. Queen. Let him attend you to the Escurial. (Exeunt. Bruch. That Confessors a Lerma. Alca. Wou'd he were shaken off. (Exeunt. Scene III. Enter Lerma and the Confessor. Ler. Nay, I am not very pious; And yet I hardly think it will be call'd A holy thought. Con. By whom? Ler. The Multitude. Confess. Oh I confess, you have a long time striv'd With mighty Care to please their giddiness. Ler. She is my Daughter. Confess. The fitter then to save her Father. Is't not more piety for such a Cause To lose her honour, then her own Appetite; And she perhaps may do like other Women. Ler. You have confirm'd me now to be that thing, I faintly wist before; were all the Honours Of my dead Ancestors, Lock't up in this Casket It shu'd be thus broke up; But you must now, Soften her squeamish Coyness; you may tell her, The Mistriss of a King, is half a Saint, For she'le be worshipt; and with her selfe She Raises up her Father to his wishes. Now, by my hopes, I speak Ingeniously, You have a fine, large text, to Preach upon: And I will second you, and add new motives, Hugging her Sin, and bless her for offending, See the Sedan is come. A Sedan carried by four Mores, Caldroon attending, pass over the Stage. Con. Dispatch the slaves away, before You do unload the Chair. Cal. I understand you. Lerm. There go the Spells must catch the King: And now if Love have power, or Womens Eyes Can shoot a flame into a Sovereigns heart, I shall grow warm agen; by standing by. If these plots faile, I'le raise another Spirit Shall keep my Enemies from Rest. Conf. Swell not too soon above your banks, And so betray the head of all your springs: We will not fail what fate so e're oppose us. Ler. Nobly resolv'd; But have you found the humours of the King? Conf. Yes, I have trac'd an easie nature in him, But too much fixt, to one unhappy vertue. His temper is too gentle for our business, And would be rather cruel to himself Then unto others; for if prest to Justice I finde a pitty hangs upon his heart Like gentle dew that cooles all cruel passions. Such a smooth heart as his, will sooner take Impression of a figure then a Rough one. In his soft nature Love's prepar'd to grow, When faire Marias Eyes, their sun-beams show. Ler. Thou hast now made my hopes so strong That I dare lean upon 'em: farewell, If we but prosper now; not we on fate But she on us, shall for direction waite. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. Scene I. Enter Maria, and the Confessor following her. Maria. Is this Divinity? Defend me heaven! Conf. Sweet Lady hear me. Maria. Go preach thy heresies, to toads and serpents, Or to the Sun-burnt-Indians, whose Devotion, Is paid to that which thou woudst have me be A Devil. Conf. Pray Madam be not so Loud, you may be heard. Maria. Wou'd my Soules stormes, cou'd raise my voice Loud as the Oceans Raving; that the fool'd world May know what dangerous Couzenage may lie hid Under such holy shapes. Conf. Is this my Recompence? Maria! Oh Monstrous! Thou Exquisite Exceeder of Impieties, That dost Expect a Recompence from Sin, Perhaps 'tis all your Trades with Cheating Zeale, To teare your Jawes, and stretch your throates, to hoarsness, To Raise poor People to a fond beliefe, The easier to o'rethrow their new built faith; When such as you but Laugh at what you taught; Such a Destroyer now of all mankinde Art thou black homicide. Conf. Homicide? Who whispers to a Storme, may be o'rewhelm'd But never heard; I wish'd you to the King, And something with it, of a holier name Then what you Rave at, but farewell. Mar. âStay Fatherâ What this? A holier name?â You or I Rave indeed. Conf. Yes, and perhaps may warm your coldness, The name of Queen, Will that yet take Impression? Mar. NoâI am as chast to that as to the other, Ambition has its Lust, as well as Love. Con. You give too course a name to great Attempts, And blast our honours, with the care of yours, You may be Rais'd, unto your Princes bed, And clime by your obedience to his throne, Led by your Love, and not Ambition. Mar. These are large thoughtsâbut the Queen.â Conf. Forget her, she is in her wayne. Mar. Ha! there is no safety while she is alive. Conf. Nothings unsafe to thee but unbelief, Thy Father got thy honour, and thy life, And will not murder either: take my advise, And for the Restâseeâyour Father. Enter Lerma Ler. Tell me holy Father, is it Idolatry To pay Devotion to those Glorious Eyes, And call them Lights Divine? they are my Stars, Since their Bright Influence must direct my fate, My growth of Life, and Fortune must depend Upon their warmth, whose power must fetter pow'r, And Majesty it self Learn to obey. Mar. What meanes my honour'd Father? Ler. Call me not Father, I must take life from thee And from thy Suns, like growing fruit be Ripen'd. Mar. This is strange, to me Sir. Ler. Ha! Have you not wrought her? Conf. I have us'd my utmost art; and tempted her With the name of Queenâbutâ Ler. You are dull: I thought your profession Had been more subtile in these practises; Leave us a Littleâ (Exit Confessor. Has not your Confessor, my best Maria, Acquainted you with my designes? Mar. He told me something Sir had an ill sound, But may be 'twas his piety to try me, It was not his Religion sure to tempt me? Ler. Tempt you? to what? to a Kings Love, Perhaps his Throne; Call your own niceness folly, And not his Love, and Care Impiety. Mar. My Mother, Sir, upon her Deathbed, charg'd me (when her Acquaintance grew so great with Heaven,) That I shou'd still be chast; chast to all Appetites, Call'd pride, the Dropsie of Infected soules, That swell'd 'em first, then burst 'em. Ler. Your Mother was for t'other World When she preacht thus, but I am yet for this; And I must leave it in a hurry, unless thy power Stops the fierce whirlwinde that is just now ready To wrap me into nothingâ Mar. Heaven defend my Father. Ler. Amen, but you must help; it was On purpose that Heaven made thee faire, To save thy Father. Mar. I hope there is no danger near you? Ler. Nothing but Death, or Banishment; Come Maria, my Best, my Dear Maria, Come shine upon the King, the flames thou giv'st Will Returne warmth to thee, like the bright Sun That gives the World his heate, and yet so justly Paid back again, he lends at no expence, But preserves all, and shines, as thou maist doe. If a declining Father be thy all, if not, Let it be night, and it shall be a dark one To more than me. Mar. Oh heavens! What do you mean? Ler. Peace, see the King. This opportunity is lost. Mar. Good Sir let me go. Ler. You must not. Enter King, Duke D' Alva, the Marquess of Alcara, and Count Bruchero. D' Alva. Your Fathers blessing Lerma observes. Seal'd it with that condition. Alca. You forfiet all the strength of his advice, If at the first you break his strict commands. Bruc. The King commanded Lermas Banishment. As if some Oracle had said, till that be done, The Plague, shall Reign, or Famine, or the Sword. Ler. Marke that Maria. King. I am unwilling to begin my Reigne, With a severity to any oneâbutâ D' Alva. Look, Sir, where he is, no fitter time Then now, to through him to his Banishment. King. What Lady's that?â Alca. How he Gazes on her?â 'Tis his Daughter Sir.â D' Alva. Sir, Remember now, your Fathers Last Commands: What do you look at Sir? Ler. Now my prophetick Soul! (Aside. King. Look at?âthat fair Lady: Is she not wondrous faire? Bruc. But she is Lerma's Daughter Sir. King. No matterâMadamâ (goes to her. I ought sooner to have Saluted you, But tis not less Respect, to so much beauty To loose Civility in Admiration. (She lookes down. Ler. Speak. King. Be not displeas'd, fair wonder of your Sex, That I admire so suddenly; a flower conquest Is fit for lesser beauties. D' Alva. Sir, Do you remember? King. I do, concerning Lerma, Know, my Lord, I will not waite for a Petition That this faire Beauty might present; 'Tis Juster to her power to tell you, I can pronounce no Banishment, nor death To him that gave her Life. Ler. You poure Mercies on me. Bruc. What change is this? King. In Return my Lord, I do expect this gratitude, That I and all the Court may be made happy By this faire ObjectâI do expect your promise. Ler. You have it Sir. King. I will no more punish her modesty. D' Alva. Sir, VVill you forget? King. No more. Exit. looking on Maria, the Lords on Lerma. Ler. Now, my Maria, Should I not fall down And worship the Divinity that saves me? Mar. Are there Divinities below? Ler. There are; every wise thing is a Divinity, That can dispose, and check the fate of things: I ask no other help but thine, To make Spain know I am their Deity. Come, you must to Court, my word's engag'd. Mar. VVhat to do Sir? To be a Prostitute, or to be thought so: I shall show there Sir, not like a Sun, But like a Meteor, risen on a sudden, VVhose false light quickly slides into a vapour. Ler. Ha! Dost thou in Disobedience shew thy vertue, And with those guilty Eyes, that may preserve me, Gaze unconcern'd on my approaching ruine. Mar. Heaven will defend you Sir. Ler. I will not trouble heaven, when you may do't; Did you not hear my Banishment and Death Charg'd on the young King, as his Fathers Legacy Of safety to his Crown? VVas he not going Just to pronounce it too? when thy bright Eyes Arrested all his Anger at Loves Sute. Mar. VVhat should I do? Ler. Keep still his heat alive, or I am sent To an eternal Coldness; and like a a Crocodile, Thou may'st then weep, o're him thou hast destroy'd. Mar. VVere there no way Sir, by my death To make your life secure? I wou'd resign It willingly, and pay you back, The life I borrow'd of you. Ler. No, 'tis the death of others then must save me. Since I must fall, excuse me curs'd necessity; For I will sow Murders so thick, and sudden, That Death shall have a fruitful harvest. Mar. VVhat d'ee talke of Sir? Ler. Of Death. Mar. Of VVhose? Ler. Of those that have the power of mine. Mar. Not of the King's, Sir? Ler. Yes of the King's, VVhy d'ee start? Nature has no exceptions, though Lawes have. Mar. Direct me Heaven! Ler. Come, I trifle, And play with my own dangers, farewell: I'le leave a Fathers curse behinde me, And only stay to please my eyes with ruine Before mine comes. (Offers to go. Mar. Stay SirâI know not what to say; I will do any thing; I should have said That had been honest; but that is disobedience. I beg Sir but one minutes time to think. Ler. Doe, while I call the Confessor: Be sudden in your thoughts for death depends Upon your Meditations. Exit. Mar. VVhat storms are risen, in my shaken breast? Thoughts succeed thoughts, like restless troubled waves, Dashing out one another: if I deny, My Father, to avoid his destiny, May reach that sacred life, which I may save If I discover this my Father dies. Vertue, thou shalt protect me before heaven, Though not from this bad world. Ah me! The only way now left me to preserve A King, and Father, is t'expose my Fame: Hard fate, when Vertue is the guide to shame. Enter Lerma with the Confessor. Ler. Come, are you resolv'd? Mar. I am Sir. Ler. To what? Mar. Obedience, Sir. Ler. Oh Maria, thou breath'st new life into me And I could waste it in embracing thee; But time will not allow me choice in happiness: Heer Father, carry her, where I appointed: Remember only this my dear Maria; Be not too easie, nor too nice; she's wise That rules as much by Craft, as by her Eyes. Ex. Maria and Confessor. So now I may rise To be a Pyramid, For I have laid a large foundation, The Queen must be remember'd and forgotten Or she may shake my pollitick structures. Enter Caldroon. How now Caldroon; what has transported thee? There is a kind of wantonness that plays On thy pleas'd Countenace, what is the matter? Cald. Nothing but your good fortune cou'd Have caus'd it. Ler. Why, didst thou meet the Confessor That told thee? Cald. No. Ler. How didst thou hear it then? Cald. The quick-ey'd Rascals spy'd it. Ler. Who? Cald. Poor suffring fellows, whose business Is to watch, on every change of power: They have heard of the Kings smiles. And are now in full cry, hunting after you. Ler. Good, Excellent. Cald. They were running on a wrong track But I hollow'd 'em inâsee my Lordâ They have found you; walk by Leave 'em to my managing. Enter two or three Suitors, they follow Caldroon fawningly and how to Lerma. He walks smiling. Ler. Good, very good. Cald. Well, My Lord is now a little busie. Suit. We ever pray'd for your Grace. (Exeunt. Ler. Kind Rogues. Her's an alteration, strange as Winters Thunder, Not two days since neglected as the Grave, That holds dead Inmates; now I grow warm, The Flies begin to buzze and swarm about me; What an attractive force has a Kings favour? The Dogs now fawn upon me, that before Started away, and barkt like little Curs At some unusual Traveller; I was grown Useless, like a dull piece of Iron of no vertue, Till by a Loadstone toucht, and then it gathers. Such a Magnettick power's in a King, Where he but kindly touches, others Cling. Exeunt. Scene II. Enter King, D' Alva, Alcara, and Bruchero at a distance, the King is pensive. D' Alva. What fatal sadness, like a sullen Cloud, Hangs on his Growing Brightness? Alca. That cursed sight of Lerma's daughter Has sunk the hopes, and fortunes of all Spain When must our dangers have an End, When Lerma can beget 'em? King. My Lords, I wou'd be private. D' Alva. Wou'd your heavy thoughts, Sir, Were as obedient as we are And would at your command depart. King. I have not yet desir'd 'em to be gone. D' Alva. Have you the power, Sir, to force 'em: King. I have not power enough, it seems To compell your obedience. Alca. We will be gone, to death, when you command; Let us but leave you happy in your life. Bru. Oh Mighty Sirâ King. No more, I did not doubt your Loves, or Loyalty. I have some business in my thoughts That does require weighing: stay without. Exeunt. Oh, what a Traytor is my Love That thus unthrowns me! I am no longer King Of any thing but sorrow; and my griefs Have but a half obedience, they will stay; But wou'd not go, shou'd I command 'em from me; I see the errors that I would avoid, And have my Reason still, but not the use on't; It hangs about me like a wither'd Limb Bound up and numm'd by some diseases Frost, The Form, the same, but all the use is lost. Enter Lerma with Maria. She comes, and in her Mighty Beauty Has drawn new forces up; so wondrous powerful That Reason shrinks, to Venture the dispute. Ler. Mighty Sir, We come, like Pilgrims creeping to a shrine Of some blest Saint, by whom kind Heaven Dispenc'd its showre of Mercies on their Crown'd Devotions. King. And I, like him that gave me power Am pleas'd with Mercies when acknowledg'd, But this pilgrim, you better might have call'd Your Saint, or Mine, for her fair Mediation Is your Blessing. Rise, Maria; Your knees must bow to nothing but to Heaven. Mar. That they do now for you, Sir, though to you: For while I bend my knees, before my King, I beg that Heaven would preserve you so, And give you power over your self and others. King. Ha! Ler. Death; she will spoil me yet. King. Wou'd Heaven wou'd grant her Prayers! Ler. Fond Girl, no more of these dull Orizonsâ aside. Mighty Sir, I leave this Blessing of my life, To be a witness of my Loyalty; malice it self Cannot I hope, shake you against this testimony. Exit. King. Why do you look with fears, Maria? As if a King were by his name alone Made powerful in his passions, as his Throne. Those that obey may fear a slavery, You now may be the Tyrant, but not I. Mar. If this, Sir, from your power does you remove Against your self; there's Treason in your Love. King. It is your power that makes me any thing. Mar. I wou'd preserve you Sir, to be my King. King. Enthrone me in your heart, and make me so. Mar. A Throne of passion, for a King's too low. King. Were I no King, but blest like other men Wou'd you despise, or chide my passion then? Mar. Oh, why Sir; do you send out treacherous spies? Should they bring back such weak discoveries, 'Twere useless, as to say, what kind of Love Angels shou'd have to leave their Joys above. King. Their joys are sure, but ours are shook with care. Mar. Oh, raise my Father from his black despair While we our selves to Heavens practice raise Your Love in Mercy's show'd, and mine in praise. King. 'Tis yours, that may encrease his power and name; Mar. And shou'd his Glories, Sir, spring from my shame? King. Suppose your Father does my joys design Mar. Wou'd he to purchase Honour, ruine mine? Yet his Commands makes not my guilt the less, For Heaven allows no pious wickedness. King. Thy Father shall both Life, and Honours owe Unto thy vertues; fair Maria, know A miracle is done, I more admire, And inlarg'd Love grows from confin'd desire. Enter the Duke of Medina gazing at them. The King stands admiring. Med. What blasting sight is this? I must Disturb him, with an unwelcome piece of Duty. Sir, King. Ha! Mar. Oh my Uncle! Med. I was afraid, Sir, that you were not well. King. Not well?âwou'd you be a Physitian? Med. With all my heart sir, wou'd you let me practice, And wou'd prescribe such wholsome Medicines to you That should prevent this great distemper Growing on you and all the Nation. King. The Nation. Med. Yes, the Nation Sir, that will of you Demand their King, when you have lost him In Lerma's Charms: Think of your Father, Sir, Who did despise that any Favourite Shou'd be a lawful Traytor by permission; And Usurp all the power. King. What do you mean? Med. I mean Lerma, Sir, whose wicked hand Grasps at your painted Scepter; that Lerma That was to sink into the lowest banishment Is creeping up into your Throne, and power. That he had never twisted with my Sister, And like a Snake begotten such a Viper, Whose sliding to your bosome will but leave A sting upon your Conscience, and disturb The Ashes of her sleeping Mother. King. Though your bold Duty might receive a pardon For any large discourse; know yet, (That ignorantly you may not snatch your Fate) All injuries to Maria's virtues, Shall be forgiven as I wou'd a malice Studied to blast my Honour. Lerma whispers to the King. Med. My Life, Sir, is a thing you once believ'd; I did despise to ballance with your service. For her, Sir; Nature be my witness, I wou'd preserve her full as vertuous As I believe her wretched Mother was, But then she must not Sir, be the foul means To charm your Sacred breast, to breath out honours On every thing that is but Lermas Creature, Whose hungry Poverties must eat as deep As Famine to the Nation. Honours, mighty Sir; When they meet fortunes, are support's to Thrones But joyn'd to Poverty are the shakers of it: And wasting Crowns, sink with such deep Consumptions. King. I can give no greater Testimony That all your former services to my Father Are not forgotten, then to pardon you now. Med. If this, Sir, that I say, be an offence, Tha I wou'd have none to be King but you, Take your forgiveness back; for I must live A Traitor by your Mercy. King. If you despise our Mercy. Med. Oh Sir, upon my knees I beg it rather But 'tis for all your Kingdom, not for me: Think, Sir, what 'tis to fit upon your Throne Without your Thunder; only so much left As a swel'd Favourite will please to lend you. Enter Lerma, whispers to the King. To hurl at honest Truths; so, he may speak, And at this idle time sure you may hear. (to Maria. What, is your Father turn'd your careful Bawd? For his ambitious ends he wou'd have been So to thy Mother too, but that her vertue Had an unshaken soundness; thou art rotten As he that did beget thee; only Nature Painted thee over with a fair resemblance Of her blest Image, wou'd it were blotted out. King. Ha! she weeps, that insolent Man That dares draw tears from fair Marias eyes Shall drop his blood as fast: Without there, my Guards. Mar. Let mine, Sir, drop, before you shed my Uucles. Think how the world would curse me, when they hear Medina's love to vertue, lost his life. He talkt to me of nothing but of goodness; And when he spoke of that, (as he must needs) He nam'd my Mother, and by chance I wept. King. Thy vertue is too excellent, let thy goodness Punish him for the injuries he did thee, Though I forgive him; and hence forward I will send for you when I want your Council, to Medina. Till then, forbear my sight. Ler. Mighty Sir; Perhaps his wilde and unbecoming passions Had their beginnings from an ill-tim'd Duty. (If boldness to a Sovereign may be call'd so) Yet I dare swear, his Loyalty is perfect, Though my fond Nature is a partial surety For what I Love. Med. Oh, spare your partial kindness, good my Lord; 'Tis your old Craft to whet your sharpest weapon Upon pretended friendship; and cut a Throat, as smoothly, as if it were good manners. King. No more, left your rude breath raise an anger More fatal then you snarling: from hence be Duke of Lerma, and your next friend, what you Will call himâCome Maria, At thy fair sight my blushing anger shrinks As if some Angel from above descended, Whose powerful vision made all passions cease, But only Love, still waited on by peace. Exeunt. Manet Medina. Lerma looking back upon him Med. What a look was there To out-stare honesty? Sure he practices to set his eyes, As some do Guns to make 'em carry right, But he can take no Aim but at the fearful; Those he may hit perhaps; his full-charg'd eyes Will hardly carry level to brave minds. I must do something I think it is no Treason To snatch a King from falling down a precipice: But in Marias eyes, lies Lerma's power And I must find a way to put those Lights out, Nor will I leave to help him one small spark Then let him grope for power in the dark. Enter D'Alva, Alcar. and Bruchero. How now my Lords, do you seek any thing? D' Alva. The King, my Lord. Med. He's lost. Alca. Does not your Lordship know which way he went? Med. Wou'd you find the King? D' Alva. Yes. Med. Look in his Fathers Grave then; for his Ashes Do yet retain more Majesty then he. If you look after him that shou'd be King. You may perhaps find him in Lerma's pocket. Alca. We are miserable. Med. It tamely adds to misery to talk on't, Like hearts weaken'd with griefs, that spend Faint sorrows on their dying friends When they should strive Rather to give them help; my worthy Lords Were all your Courages, and Wisdoms ready To snatch at any honest opportunity That fortune offers: keep near the King, And cross him not, till you hear more of me: Something I'le do to merit from you all, At least, deserve your pity, if I fall. Exit. D' Alva. Heaven prosper and direct you; This mans soul is greater then his Title. Alca. We have new Titles. Bru. And likely to have more, all the Spawn Of that poor slave, Caldroon, must be Call'd Something, as well as he is now They say a Marquis. D' Alva. The Queen! her looks are full of sorrow, All is not well. Enter the Queen and Catilina with Ladys. D' Alva. Madam. Alca. Royal Lady. Bru. Is your Majesty not well? Queen. Ha! I was thinking of the King. D' Alva. What of him Madam? Queen. I know not what, but yet he lately seeks Retirements from his friends, and from himself. A fatal sadness grows upon his youth And makes him haste (before it comes) to age. D' Alva. He has ill Council, Madam. Alca. From Lerma too. Queen. I thought e're now, he had been banisht. Bru. He'l banish us all, if his power holds. He hangs in the Kings bosome like his Crucifix, And with no less an Adoration. He may be safe in power, that can beget Those beauteous Charms that have subdu'd the King, Power seems to grow, nay grow his own Inheritance. Queen. We must quickly try to prevent This growing danger to us all, and Spain, Where's Medina? D' Alva. Shall he be sent for? Queen. Ha!âI feel a coldness creeping in my veins What haste it makes to my griev'd heart.â Ah me!â She faints. Bru. Carry her in, this news Has troubled her. The Queen is carried off. D' Alva. I cannot tell, I am suspicious of all Accidents. Alca. These fainting fits seem as if she were With Child. D' Alva. With Death, I fear. Enter Catalina. Alca. How now, how does the Queen? Cata. I fear there is as little hopes now left, As signs of life; just as we laid her on the bed, She fetcht a heavy groan mixt with a sigh, I fear all the small stock of breath That she had left. D' Alva. This is sudden. Cata. 'Tis fit your Lordship know all my suspicion; I doubt she's poyson'd, this fatal day: There came a Fryer with a face unknown To the Queens Anti-chambet; To all, a stranger, and to the Queen her self; By him, a Letter was deliver'd to her, Which had no name, but in its matter fair: When she had half read o're the fatal Paper Her eyes seem'd to grow weary, and her pulse Kept an uneven, and a heavy time, and then Just as you saw her now, she fainted. Alca. What became of the Fryer? Cata. 'Tis not yet known; for in this hurry While every one was careful of the Queen He vanisht. Bru. 'Twas poyson on my life. D' Alva. 'Tis evident, we must make further Search into't. Bru. You must assist us Madam; and by your faith Revenge the murder of your Mistriss. Cata. Doubt not my Faith or Secresie, I must return I fear, to a dead woman. Exit. Alca. Here's a strange Relation: Bru. It must be kept with secresie: We are Hunted, and the toyls pitcht about us. Enter to them, Caldroon, the Arch-Bishop of Toledo. Alca. See the new Indian Stars. D' Alva. Silence, he gapes; a Proclamation sure. Cald. The Duke of Lerma, Constable of Spain; By Father Francisco late Confessor to His Majesty, now Arch-Bishop of Toledo And me Roderigo del Caldroon, Marquis Of Mirida; and Treasurer of Spain; Commands thee, Philip Duke D' Alva Don Pedro, Marquis of Alcara; And Don Bruchero, Great Major Domo; Within an hour to meet in Council. D' Alva. Here's a volley of Titles. Cald. We must inform you further, of The Queens death. Alca. The Confessor should have told us that. Bru. The Arch-Bishop, you forget your self: Arch. Markt ye that my Lord? Cald. Why my Lords, the truth is nothing lessen'd In my Report. D' Alva. No nor the sadness: we shall attend the Constable. Arch. I do not like that word of Alcara. Exeunt D' Alva, Alca, and Bru. Cald. Pish, 'tis a fond fear, who shou'd Reveal it to him? he slept not since 'Twas done, and cou'd not dream it. Arch. Wou'd 'twere undone. Cald. Oh, your treacherous Conscience Wakes too late; who shou'd betray it? Arch. The disguiz'd Fryer. Cald. He was ignorant of what he carry'd, Arch. I have some business that commands Me hence, the rest your self can mannage. Cald. Be constant, or you loose usâ Exit. I like him not, this scrupulous Church-man Has a shrinking Liver, that stops the motion Of his bloud sometimes, and such another Fright, may like an Earthquake Shake him into discoveries of all; A blush, in such a case as this, Is evidence sufficient for a Jury. But I'le confirm him, or send his faint Contrition to th'other world, and he Shall be the messenger. He must be held in use, or he will Rust, We must find mischiefs out to keep him busie, Lest he have time to think how to be good; Leisure begets relapses in his Blood. Exit.</field>

I will be bolder, and knock your Greatness, Without you study quickly a set-form To aske forgiveness in. Cald. My honour can defend it self From worse opposers. (Drawes. Med. Ile mince your Honour, And send your Lowsie Family the shares Of your divided Greatness. (Drawes. Enter Alcara and Bruchero. Alca. Hold, this place is not for Quarrels. Med. Nor for wrongs. Alca. How was't? Med. Let me speak, that dare tell truth. Cald. When I Relate the manner, it shall be To those that have the Power to punish. Med. Let me goe. There's nothing that has a Lawful birth, That can endure this mongrel Greatness. Enter the Duke of Lerma, leading Maria Veil'd, with Attendants. Ler. What Hurry's here? Cald. I know not, the Duke Medina thinks His Greatness, Entitles him to Injure Any one. Ler. Ile blow him and his storms quickly away. Med. Is your Breath so powerful, that it can Puffe men off like tops of Thistles. Ler. I cannot now spare so much time As to lose any on your Braules, Caldroon, I have Employment for you. Exeunt Lerma, Maria, and Caldroon. Med. And for that piece of Nightworke too I take it. Alca. Pray peace my Lord. Med. Let me go, I will but ask him A Civil Question. Alca. What is't? Med. Whether great men, and fathers too Are not the best and closest Bawdes. Alca. Fye, fye, Consider who they are. Med. 'Tis that consider'd doubles every wrong: Had I been sindg'd with Lightning, I had stood With all my wrongs husht as unwindy night; But to be scorcht thus by a Candles Snuffe, A thing that only Blazes in expiring, And which must die in its own noisomness: Makes my Impatience swell above the bankes Of common temper. Alca. You must restrain this fury, whose effect Turnes to your own destruction. Enter the King, with a few. Med. What's this? Alca. The King. Med. I will speak. Alca. Take heed good my Lord. King. Which way went Lerma? Med. Headlong Sir, and 'twill be dangerous To follow him. King. What's this? Med. I was your Souldier once Sir, And had Commission to destroy your Enemies; And I have done it with my Swords as boldly As I will now attempt it with my Tongue: And 'tis against a greater Enemy Then ever fortune brought me to oppose In all your Battels. King. VVhat enemy is this? Med. So great a one, that he is now become More terror to your Souldiers, then those Armies They alwayes met, with noble hopes of conquest. Here victory is lost already: for Lerma Has took you captive. King. 'Tis boldness, and not duty, to question Princes favours. Med. But not to beg 'em Sir, no more then 'tis To pray, That Heav'n wou'd turne a vengeance from us, Threatning in Lerma's power: Do not forget Great Sir, the last desires your father made, And force him to call louder from his grave. Turne, mighty Sir, your lookes the other way, And see your widdow'd People want their King, Drooping like dayes unlook'd on by the Sun. Your Councel wither'd more with care then Age, Grown as much strangers to your great Affaires As unto Lerma's pleasure. Alca. Excellent! 'tis nobly honest. King. Must Princes favours then be limited, Or Judg'd by common Breaths? 'Tis restless Envy, that urges Mutinies Shelter'd under Duty. (Exit. Med. So the lesson is learn't perfect. Oh Impudence! to make the Majesty of Kings The pawn of all their villanies. Alca. Brave Lord, though I grieve to see you prest Thus into needless dangers; yet I must Joy, that our Country can yet boast such worth. Med. O my Lord, so wretched are we growing, I tremble to out-live our happiness: Those that wou'd alwayes live among Diseases, Venters for life more then I do for death. Alca. Nay, my brave Lord, You shall see all your friends dare share With equal Courage the worst fate; For wisely to go back is now too late. My Jellousies are just, lend me your aide, And we may dive into the heart of all. Med. And into his that wrought these mischiefes too, In greater privacy I'le utter more; Let us be firme, and like a mighty weight, Sinking our selves, press others to their fate. (Exeunt. Scene II. Enter the King, and Maria, with two Papers. King. It is a thing of great concerne Maria, And I should have the opinion of my Councel. Mar. Your Councel Sir? are you their Sovereigne, Or wou'd you be a slave to their opinions? King. But ifâ Mar. If what? Dull Majesty, is this the loudest tune Of a Kings powerful breath? if's and but's; The timerous Language of the meanest people, That are to give Account of their low actions Unto Authority: Princes Determinations Shou'd be as free as they design their power; Not shaken with the Aguish touch of doubts: What tracts leaves the great Ocean? or, Who Questions Why it is calme, or rages? who shall chide The Sun that warmes one portion of the World More then another? When you are absolute In love, or power, then I'le beg again. King. Stay; I have Resign'd my Reason to My Love, Give me the Warrants.â âNow think Maria (The King signes them. VVhether you have not ask't too much Of one you love so little. Mar. Have you done it Sir? King. You see I have. Mar. Do you not repent it Sir? Nor hate me as an Instrument, Of pressing you to Acts, unworthy of you. King. Oh Maria, 'tis as hard for me to hate, As 'tis for you to love. Mar. But have I not amaz'd you Sir, In pressing you so hastily unto an Act Or such Importance? King. A little. Mar. Thus low I beg your pardon; And by this measure see to what dangers Princes expose themselves, and Crownes By too much trust, and kindness. King. How's this? Have you then Acted, what you thought amiss? Mar. I have Sir, by necessity, not choice; My Fathers violence had took another way More fatal, had I not gain'd from you These Governments, as he designs to send Away the Marquess of Alcara, and Count Bruchero. King. Ha! Mar. Now have I set before you Sir a Mirrour, That truely showesâ âHow fatal 'tis for Princes, To shine on any with contracted kindness. King. VVhither must all this tend? Mar. For he that does engross your beams Robs others of your Light, and is a cloud That hangs upon your brightness; breeding Ill weather to all the World besides; while he seems To make you practice power unlimitted; Just then you have the least, obeying his. King. Excellent Woman! Mar. From henceforth Sir be every bodies King, And then you are your Selfe: lend equal Eares To what all say, and like a skilful Chymist Draw the quick spirit off, from every Counsel, And from your wise breast breath it as your own. King. Oh Maria, you set foundations for my Love, upon my reason now. Mar. One thing more I have to beg, And then (my Fathers Life only excepted) It is the last I'le ask: these VVarrants Sir I will deliver to my Father; but in the mean time Those Lords shall have private directions, A little to deferr their preparations; If you dare trust me Sir, it is your safety I study now: pardon my foolish feares, Your danger only nam'd, calls forth my teares. King. Oh do not waste the treasure of your eyes, For such a life that you so much despise, While I more justly disobey in this, To dare be careless of the thing you wish. Mar. Can you my heart for want of friendship blame, That for your safety have expos'd my fame? Love to your glories, shou'd his flames resign, As fires their Light, when the bright Sun does shine. King. If thrones be seates for cares, in a Kings breast Love has a Title sure among the rest: My love, as a fair vertue, I proclaime, When it growes foule, I will conceale my shame. Mar. Ah, 'tis some ease to love, to be confest; But, 'tis a torment, when it is supprest. King. Do's cruelty, a sign of kindness, prove? Mar. It is the greatest to deny the Love. King. Both cannot suffer in one cruelty. Mar. I shou'd confess too much, shou'd I deny. King. Wou'd you more cruel then you are appear? Mar. Pray Sir be gone, I've said too much I fear. King. Mariaâ Mar. âIf you have pity Sir be gone, Leave me to blush a little while alone. King. Farewell, I'le love, though you shou'd still design To hide your own, and ne're to pity mine. (Exit. Mar. Among what Rocks I steer a dangerous course, My duty to a King, and to a Father; My Countries shaken honour, and my own, Calling at once upon me to take heed: There's something more then this yet shakes my heart, But I will throw the Ague off, least I That to direct others their way design, Shou'd my self want a friend, to show me mine. Enter Lerma. Ler. Have you prevail'd? Mar. Yes Sirâbutâ Ler. No matter for a Reason, or a Circumstance, Give 'em me; and still maintain thy power, That I may pay Alegeance to thy eyes; So now retire, for the Court begins to fill. Exit Maria. Enter Alcara and Bruchero. They come, she was dispatcht in happy time. Bruc. See the full Sail of Spain. Alca. Strike, and pass by. Ler. The King by me salutes you. Alca. This was a running Lottery, Lerma throwes them the Warrants, and Exit. Mines a good prize, the Vice-Roy Ship of Naples. Bruc. Mine, of Navarreâ Alca. VVhy this great man drops Kingdomes As a full-plum'd-Hawke mewes her loose Feathers, And never cares who stoopes to take 'em up. Bruc. He has some other meaning in't. Alca. 'Tis certain his bounty else had never Showr'd on us. Enter the Arch-bishop, and Caldroon. Alca. See these are of his Councel. Bru. And now come sweating with their fond complements. Arch. My Lords, you are much engag'd Unto his Grace, the Duke of Lerma. Bru. We have the Bonds about us. Cald. Oh, such another friend as Lerma The Earth holds not. Alca. 'Tis believ'd. Arch. Had you but seen, how he implor'd the King, Pleaded your worths, and your abilities; I think you wou'd have thought, as now you may, Nature had ty'd him to you in some bond. Bru. The Duke is, as he ever was, Covetous to scatter favours, though unaskt. Cal. I, and so careful of the men he markes To make election of in his great thoughts, That when they sleep, he wakes to make 'em great. As I dare sware you never thought of this. Alca. Not I, I vow to you. Cald. I hope, my Lord, it shall not be forgotten Arch. That were too foul Ingratitude. Bru. Oh never, my Lord, and to assure the Dukeâ Arch. Tis well, so may you prosper. Alca. What think you now? Exit Arch. and Caldroon. Bru. 'Tis Rankâyou and I, my Lord, Are busie, and stand too much in his way; Our remove will give his Actions scope. Alca. H'as wove his curst inventions cunningly. How he threw his guilty Favours to us; And durst not stay to take our Thanks, Here's more intelligence, see the Duke. Enter Medina, leading Izabella veild. He has got something too. Med. Your way's now cleer: there's one Will bring you to your Attendanceâ Remember to bring Maria to the Garden At the appointed time. Izab. I will not fail on my part. Exit. Alca. You have got a fair charge, my Lord. Med. When you know all, you'l say so. Bru. VVe two, my Lord, are banisht. Med. Banisht? Alca. But to Honourable employments. Med. VVe have trifl'd then too long; And suffer'd this black Cloud to grow too big VVhose breaking will drown us all. Bru. See here the sentence of our banishments. Enter a Woman veild, puts a Letter into Alcara's hand, and Exit. Bru. VVhat's this, that vanisht? Alcara Reads, and seems amaz'd. Med. Some secret Invitation. Bru. How now man, what not impart It to your friends? Alca. Yes Read. Bruchero reads. To the Marquis of Alcara. You and your friend Count Bruchero, will receive two Patents fer your Honourable banishment, 'twill not be unpleasant to the King, if you pretend sickness or business to deferr going to you imployments; This advice admire not at, but follow. Bru. This is strange. Med. The Advice is good, no matter who sent it. Nor could it come from any common hand, The business is too young to be acquainted With any thing but one that knew its birth. Alca. 'Tis true, and we must put it off. Bru. And yet it may prove dangerous. Med. The dangers only in accepting it. If we disperse our selves, he'l catch us up, Like a flowen Covey; besides, the Letter says The King will not be displeas'd: there is some Mole That heaves for us unseen; Count Bruchero You shall pretend, that to prevent all Rumours You'l perfect your Accounts before you go. You, my Lord, must pretend sickness And seem to keep your chamber; Prescribing to your Doctors a Receipt, To make them say as you do, and in hard words Set forth a dangerous distemper, Alca. Good; but what success attends on this? Med. That we must wait for; honest designes Justly resemble our Devotions, Which we must pay, and wait for the Reward: Yet this I'le add, to strengthen your Resolves I have some designs, I think can't fail me Shall shake the great foundation, Lerma laid; We search deep Mines, and if the veins but hold, VVe purchase all the VVealth we wish to have, And if it fails, we dig a Noble grave. Exeunt. Scene III. Enter Caldroon, with Letters. Cald. Mischiefs, with Plagues, Engender every where And beget new diseases; the Queens Murder Is more then whisper'd now; and the Dukes Daughter Is Indian talk, the 'tother World is full on't, And, which is more then all, the Messenger That brought that fatal Letter to the Queen In which her death was seal'd; is by Medina Sent for in private: whom we thought asleep, But wak't too soon, before our careful friend Cou'd stop him in his close attempt. The Storm has overtook our greatest speed. Nor can the Duke himself find out a shelter: I'le instantly entomb my new got wealth In a disguis'd Chappel which I've consecrated To my dead Ancestors; that may save me yet; 'Tis pity to take ill pains to rake up wealth, Which at the last can purchase us no more Then a mean life, which we enjoy'd before. Enter Lerma and the Arch-Bishop. The Duke, and trouble in his face, I'le step aside a little. Exit. Ler. Said he, he would not go? Arch. Till his Accounts were level'd. Ler. And Alcara is sick? Arch. 'Tis so given out. Ler. They have me in the wind, There is some secret trick in this, or else They durst not slight me thus; it must be so, My violent motion grows already slow: Ill weather falls about me, every way I try to take, proves heavy travelling. Arch. The peoples cries grow loud. Ler. The gaul'd Raskals wince at my oppressions, They are like swarms of Bees, when up and buzzing They light on any thing; Alcara, and Bruchero That dare dispute their Sovereigns Command, Gives language to their murmers, I have striv'd In Hunters toils like a fierce Lybian Lion And am grown weaker by my strugling. Arch. The King hears nothing of all this. Ler. No, Maria's charms hang yet about his Sences; But all this weight will stretch Loves bonds; whose tyes Are weakly twisted between Gazing eyes. A little distance or some new Object May set his heart free and unravel all. Arch. 'Tis dangerous. Ler. Extreamly; besides, I fancy, she grows Dark to my business, and has starts As if she wou'd loose me before her Honour. Arch. What's to be done? Ler. No way but what we last resolv'd on, And that out-does the soul of all invention. Arch. I'm ready for the Journey. Ler. Your safety is included in my peace Which with like care, all my designs propose. Arch. The way for my departure's made already. And the feign'd Letters from his Holiness; Show'd and allow'd by the Kings great Council. Ler. 'Tis well, this Pacquet then determines All the rest, and now, my Lord, cut through The tardy time, and let your expedition kill my doubts While I at home will fann away these fears, Till this hot weather changes; so farewell. Arch. Farewell, keep the storm off till then, With the advantage of the Sun, you hold, And my return shall be swift as your thought. Exit. Ler. Farewell, and prosper. Enter Caldroon with Letters. Ha! thy face is full of Newes. Cald. Such as I wish I had not: Is the Arch-bishop gonâ I dare not show my Lettersâ Ler. But now dispatcht. Cald. But now?âHumh! Ler. Thou fright'st me with thy Accents, Why that Humh? Cald. Nothing my Lord. Ler. Thou Lyest? Cald. My Lord. Ler. Ha! dost thou swell, that art my creature? Thy breath is nurtur'd from my bounty; Why art thou then a Traitor to my trust. Cald. My Lord, you do amaze me. Ler. Why dost thou hide such necessary truths, And ruine all my plots for want of knowledge? Cald. I love your peace so well, I dare not utter it. Ler. Why Caldroon? What craven temper hast thou found in me? What chill cold standing blood without a tide? That thou shou'dst think I know what 'tis to fear: Thou'st seen me fight against a destiny, Which I have turn'd, by wise and bold designes; Thou'st seen me poorer then the cheekes of Famine, Less lov'd and follow'd then infected Townes: Could'st thou then witness once, in all these hazards, That fate could triumph in one sigh of mine. Cald. Alass, my Lord. Ler. Pitty me, if thou seest me tremble at it; Come, I will know it all: and, tell it me, In the most horridst Language thou canst study; For I am skilful, and can tune all terrors. Cald. My Lord, this packet first is a sad witness of too much danger. Ler. So. (He reades. Cald. His colour changes. Ler. Keep in false fear, he must not see thee: (Aside. Cald. His blood flies up and down, the storm has tost it. (Aside. Ler. Ha, ha, ha, does this trouble thee? Let 'em all like creeping Snakes hiss at me, I have a charme yet left shall dead their stings; Yet it was fit I should know all this: What more is there? Cald. Much, my Lordâforâ Ler. Let it alone; Attend me in my Closet, There I'le satisfie thee better. Cald. I'le attend your Graceâ (Exit. Ler. Now heart, I give thee leave to sigh, and swell, My thoughts must not be judg'd by these base slaves Who hang upon my Fortune, not on me; Such Instruments, like flatter'd Princes, Must never hear but of prosperity; Vertue can singly stand on its own trust, But passions must depend on truth of others. Our hopes of victory on mean Mens vallors, Ambition upon base and wretched Instruments, On Women Love, more treacherous then all; Yet in despight of my curst Enemies, I'le find a conquest in a safe retreate, And though they rise, I'le sink to be as great. (Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. IV. Scene I. Enter Maria, and Izabella. Mar. You're welcome, and I dare trust your goodness; Since it can share with me in my condition, Which is a bitterness well guilded only. Iza. I never shall deceive you, Madam. Mar. Perhaps I may do you, and all the VVorld Who thinks I doate upon my splendid shame. Iza. VVhat's this? aside. Mar. The Character which I have had of you Gives me a confidence I've found a friend That I may weep to; sorrow's like a child Which loves to be bemoan'd. (weepes. Iza. Sure she is Injur'd. Mar. Come, sit down: see Izabella. These flowers live without the sence of sorrowes. Iza. And yet they'l hang their heads in scorching heate, VVhen no kind drops fall on 'em. Mar. 'Tis true, as if like me they wanted pitty, But I'le stoop down upon their fragrant beds, And weep upon 'em. Oh Izabella, Wou'd any thing could prosper by my griefes: Iza. I must believe her.â (Soft Musick. Mar. Harke, VVhat's that? Iza. Nothing Madam, 'tis but your fancy. Mar. 'Tis Harmony, and cannot be my fancy, For that is out of tune. Enter Medina as a Genius, in a glittering Habit. Ha! VVhat's this? help Izabella. Iza. Sit still Madam, 'tis only some design To entertain you, the Musick showes it now. The Musick ceases; and the Genius speakes. Gen. I am the Genius which does waite Upon Spaines loose and shaken State; I Rule the Spirits of the Aire, VVho, as their guide to me repaire; And then by me to every minde A several genius is assign'd, VVho waite and whisper to their Soules, But no decree or power controules; For every one their freedomes use, And all their faults, and vertues chuse. The account of every deed and thought Are by the winged Spirits brought: VVe sit in Sun-beames, while they tell The newes of mortalls that do well; But when they tell of vice, they shrou'd Their heads, and whisper't in a cloud. Some merit neither praise nor shame, VVho tempt not fate, nor trouble fame; Those Spirits that on such attend, I'le charme, to show how time they spend. He Charmes, an Entry of Spirits, imitating vain men dumb. Now, from above, I'le call for one That is the Genius of the throne; Next thine, whose sighes encrease the Aire, That thou art not so chast as faire: 'Tis those alone waste every houre, That wait on beauty, or on power. Enter the First Genius. 1. Gen. See, I obey, and now am weary grown Longer to wait upon a Throne Then let me take some rest And flie to whisper to a common Brest; Not fed with Luxury, Nor flater'd up to be a Deity. He waves his Wand, and enter the second Genius. 2. Gen. I come, I come, fill'd with despair To whisper longer, to the proud and fair. Their own just Conquest they despise And please themselves with guilty victories: Against those Altars I in vain perswade Where worship is by time decay'd. 1. Gen. I oft have mingled with the thoughts Of Kings, and told, they were not Deities, And how all Princes faults Made men have daring Tongues and Eyes. 2. Gen. I told this Beauty too her fate That one foul Crime had such a weight That all must sink; and he that first does find A Beauty, yet unblemisht, kind, He is like one that does discover An unknown World, by whose success He makes a way for others to possess; As she's made ready for another Lover. Both. Then set us free, that we may find, In low Estates, a steady mind, Whose harmless Life, and vertuous Love Is farre above The reach of Vice, or fear of Fate; Let no good Genius henceforth wait Upon such false, and such unsteady things As ador'd Beauties, or as flatter'd Kings. Exeunt. Mar. Ha, Izabella, There is some Further meaning, sure in this, I do not like it. Med. You must. Mar. How must? what are you? I am betray'd Izabella, stay; what was all this meant for? Exit Iza. Med. Truth. Mar. These shapes spoke falshood. Med. I'le help you to one then, shall tell you Truths. D'ee know me? Pulls off his disguise. Mar. My honour'd Uncle; brave Medina, My wonders greater then my doubts before, Med. The greatest wonder is behind. Mar. What's that? Med. Thy Lust. That does exceed all wicked Miracles. Mar. My Lord, for pitties sake. Med. 'Tis pitty, forces me to this violence, The pitty of thy Blood, I had a share in Before it was infected with this Leprosie; The pitty of thy Youth, thy beauteous Youth, Like a fair Flower pluckt up by the Root When 'twas but newly budding, before time Could show it to the World, how sweet it was. Mar. Do but hear me Sir. Med. Yes, if you'l speak Repentance with a passion As great as that which made your act your lewdness, Then I will heaken like a doating Mother To hear her Children prais'd by flattering tongues. Put if it be to excuse or mittigate Thy wretched Fathers, or thine own offence. And Bawd for whorish Acts, by poor excuses; The Ears of Cruelty shall not be deafer, Nor storms to crying Seamen that must sink, As thy drown'd Honour does, though not so deep. Mar. My Lord. Med. Think of thy Mother now, that through some Starr Looks blushing down on thy Impieties; And finds it harder to hold a wrath from thee With all the Mediation of the Saints, Then 'twas to purchase for her self by vertue That blest Eternity which she enjoys. Oh, thou hadst been blest, Maria; if thy Father, Like other Wolves, had been then torn to pieces Before he knew what he begot in thee; For thou hadst then wanted a powerful Pander: Or, had Heaven blest thee with Deformity, Thou hadst been safe in unattempted vertue. Oh Maria, it is thy Beauty that has been The fatal blazing Star that did foretell The hot Contagion that has follow'd in thee. Mar. Will you not hear me then, my Lord? Med. Dost thou make way at all for me to Hear thee? or hast thou yet let fall a tear? To bribe me from pronouncing cruel Judgement. Mar. When I want innocence, I'le weep, or beg of you and Heaven; But I that have preserv'd My virtue, as unstain'd as at the time When my blest Mother (who now smiles upon me) Gave me and that together to the World. I will not stain it by a false confession. Med. What's this? Mar. A Truth, which I am bound by tyes of Nature And Honour, to tell you, and all the world, Nay, on my knees I thank you, that you take The room of a lost Father up so kindly; And question me, for all you do suspect: And I will gladly tell you my true story Like those that with a pleasure do repeat The tales of Mighty dangers they have past. But if your foul beliefe, like the Worlds tongues Can only think all Ill, as they can speak 'em Then I rise thus, and from my vertue borrow A scorn, as great as such from their own vices Can borrow foul opinions. Med. Why, what a fool was I, I did expect Repentance, and shou'd have look'd for Impudence: Perhaps you fool your self into this boldness And think there's no man that dares question The Mistriss of a King, but I wou'd sooner Destroy a Traitor to my Princes Soul, Then to his Crown. Mar. The King has as much vertue as I wish him. Med. That easily may be, but 'tis a question Whether he will continue still so bad, As thou desir'st him. Mar. I see that you are deaf to hear of goodness And I must either have a guilt within, To beg enough, or Vertue to despise you. And when you know, which you shall quickly do How you have injur'd me, you will repent Your bold injustice.âso farewel Med. Stay, stay, you must not go. Mar. Must not? Med. No, nor shall not: the Masquers that you saw Are all my trusty friends, 'tis in vain To cry, or tear your Throat. Mar. What do you mean? Med. To shake you in your damn'd security Or set your soul free from that guilded frame Whose unseen rotteness corrupts it. Mar. Will you murder me? Med. I did not come with that intention. But thou hast rais'd me to a vertuous anger That tempts me to prevent thy shame and mine. Yet will you turn your eyes in to your Brest, And they must weep, for they will see thy heart So very foul, that it needs pious washing. Mar. Nay then. If your scorn'd anger swell'd you to a Mountain And were to fall upon me, I wou'd stand Thusâand not shake, but wou'd despise Your ruine and mine own. Med. Yet repent, and do not force my hand To a swift Justice that must send thy Soul, VVhere vitious falseness dares not tell a tale. Mar. I had rather be judg'd there then here. Med. Then, Justice, I thus obey thy strict command But powerful nature stayes my feeble hand. Drawes aside. Mar. VVhy do you pause? your passion is more noble Then your vertue, one can make trial of me T'other dares not; Strike, and all the while, See what suspected Sin startles my Soul, Or stirs me to a blush. Med. Dare you endure to die? Mar. VVer't not a sin, perhaps I durst do more Med. VVhat more? Mar. Give my self what I wish, as easily As I provoke your shaking hand to do't. Enter Izabella running. Iza. Oh my Lord, undone, undone, the Kings just Coming, and searches for Maria. Med. The King?âno matterâ I'le fall nobly, now you shall be reveng'd. Mar. I cou'd weep now to see the great Medina Believe all ill so easily; when you speak Of my unhappy Father, his bare name Confirmes you in your cruel censure of me: But though you talke of my blest Mother to me A thousand times, you have not power to think, One drop of vertue has descended to me From that pure fountain. Med. Oh Heav'n! send peace to my distracted Soul, And tell me which is truth. Mar. Heaven will tell you suddenly, but we forget, Put on your disguize, and leave the rest to me. Med. This disguise may be more fatal Then my own shape. Mar. You must not for the World appear your self, For then you will be thought, the Author Of something I intend, which will be fatal to you. Dare you trust me in nothing? Med. Well, in this I dareâIzabella, Bid my friends hide their disguises And conceale themselves. Iza. I will. (Exit Izab. Mar. You remember there was a Letter Written to the Marquess of Alcara, And Count Bruchero. Med. I do: Did you write it? Mar. No more questions now. Med. But I will aske something; For I grow willing to believe thee good: Pray tell me. Mar. Peace, I hear a noiseâLook If you see any comming. Med. 'Tis the King; I trust you now Maria. Mar. Doe so alwayes then. Enter the King, D' Alva, &amp;c. King. MariaâHow now, What's this? Mar. Pray Sir do not look upon him, 'Twill make the poor man so out of countenance, That I shall have no more Diversion; It seemes that Izabella and the Gardiner Contriv'd an Entertainment for me, It was done just as your Majesty came. D' Alva. This is an odd Excuse. King. I shou'd have been sorry to have Interrupted your pleasures. Mar. Pray Sir do not look at him, He'le be so asham'd. King. I will look on nothing but thy brightness; Come Maria, I fell in love with thee, Then with thy vertue, which was hard to find In so much Beauty; th'other is so common It beares no Rate, there's poverty in vice; The hardest things to find bear greatest price. Med. This is the likeliest thing To vertue, I ever saw: Exeunt King, Maria, D' Alva. Besides, had she been vitious, She would not have neglected her Revenge, One of the pleasant'st lust ill Women have: All may be Counterfeitâand yetâ There may be such a thing as a good Woman. Enter Izabella. How now, VVhat news? Iza. All safe; I must hast after them. Med. Stay, and prethee tell me my best Cozen, Dost thou think Maria vertuous? Iza. By Heaven I doe. Med. By Heaven I have a minde to do so too. Iza. I have observ'd things worthy of your knowledge. Another time I will relate them to you. Something she's resolv'd to doe, I'le watch To find it out: So farewell, I dare not stay. (Exit Izab. Med. I know not what to think; I wou'd believe, but yet my shaken faith Creepes to its growth but slowly, like an Infant Forc't to a hasty birth before its time. Our lives and our devotions are but sickly, When Anguish doubts their growing health controules; A shaken faith's the storme of tottering soules. Enter D' Alva. Ha! D' Alva? What has brought him back? D' Alva. Heres the Apparition still, I must be satisfied, What are you Sir? Med. One of Lerma's Angels. D' Alva. Lerma's Devils. Med. See, my Lord, I meant his evil Angel. D' Alva. Oh my dear Lord, (Discovers himself. Pardon my apprehension; We tread upon such rough and narrow pathes, That any trick, or error, throwes us down. Med. Feare not, my Lord, I have discovered And broken, as I hope, the best foundation That Lerma builds upon. D' Alva. Let us delay no time, but instantly To councel with the Marquess of Alcara, And Count Bruchero; they have something To impart, that is of great Importance. Med. To add to all, I have secur'd the Witnesses, Antonio, and Catalina; we'le lose no time, VVhilst Lerma, as I hear, thinks I am fled, And Joyes in fulness of his growing power. But let him swell fate never durst deny Bold spirits, to dispose of destiny. Unshaken Trees, that have the largest rootes; A bold, and well-arm'd hand as well may throw As those, whose Rootes do not so deeply grow. (Exeunt. Scene II. Enter Lerma. Ler. If my invention faile not, I have yet Out-stript 'em all; if my wing'd Mercury Keep touch in time: The Court lookes odly, And every brow weares mysteries about 'em: The fawning Rascalls of it (which like Cobwebs Shou'd be swept off) methinks avoid me now, VVho us'd to crowd, and stop my way with cringes; Their smiles look like the grins of anger'd Monkey's: But I am safe, while my Marias Charmes Hang on the King, and numb him to a Lethergy, There's some that are too great, must be cut down, Feign'd Accusations, and a little time Will kill all wonder, which is shorter Liv'd Then dreams of Children, or old Womens tales. Enter Angelo. Ang. My Lord. Ler. Ha! Death on thee, I was serious. Begonâthis was a guilty start, This slave too, will perhaps strikes him. Ex. Angelo. Grow wise, and guess at something, How hard it is, in slippery ways To keep a steady Motion. Enter Caldroon. How now? what news?âspeak. Cald. I am too narrow to contain, It is too great to keep or to let out. Ler. Curse on this form in thy Relations. For thou dost practice on me like an Advocate Whose spleenative exordiums are more horrid Then the ill cause he wou'd make monstrous. Cald. Your Daughter, Sir. Ler. Is sweeter then the Spring, wreath'd in the Arms Of budding Flowers; what more of her? Cald. There can't be Man enough in you to hear it, And then out-live it; 'tis so great a weight I almost sink to bring it. Ler. And yet art such an Ass under thy burden As not to throw it off: for tell it me And I have all thy weight. Cald. You cannot hear it. Ler. Not if you do not tell it. Cald. 'Twill crush you. Ler. It must be heavier then all the weight Of peoples curses, and the great ones envies: Thou dost not know one thing, Caldroon; Fortune and I did long agoe agree I to make work for her, and she for me. Tell it me boldly; and prethee now Caldroon Do not like those that bring a bitter potion Make scurvy faces at it, as you give it. Cald. Oh, my Lord, Dogs howlings. or the groans of Mandrakes Wou'd be a Consort of soft Musick To this harsh thing I have to utter. Ler. Thou'st numb'd my Sences like a skilful Surgeon And now may'st strike, I shall not feel thy hand. But come, what of Maria? Cald. She's gone, stole away, Unknown by whom, or whether. Ler. This is a dangerous wound indeed I know not where to search it. Cald. My Lord, I told you what 't wou'd come to. Ler. Oh, Sir, you are a Mighty Prophet, Where was the King? Cald. As they say, asleep. Ler. Could he sleep? and his dull soul without A dreaming whisper, that she was loosing, And when he wakes, and misses her, what then? Cald. He will be troubled sure. Ler. Troubles wear off from Kings (they are too high To grieve, and sorrow slides from them) like falling drops From sides of houses,âthey dare not hurt her sure. Cald. It cannot be imagin'd that they dare. Ler. She must appear again, our rapid motions Will bring us round again to that fair sun If the King loves her too, (as sure he does) Her absence makes it night with him. I wonder what they meant by't. Cald. I cannot guess, my Lord. Ler. Thou'rt shallow then; they fondly think The King will be uncharm'd, and hearken to their Clamours, now she that stood between Their breath and him is thus remov'd; 'Twas pollitically done;â And yet they dare not tell him where she is, Nor the bold ravisher confess the fact. For yet, Caldroon, she hangs upon his heart Like hopes of Joy upon a troubled soul; I have a plot to help us yet, at least To give us time till I have searcht this further. Cald. What is't my Lord. Ler. I'le instantly to the halfe soul-less King, For he must want his better part of Life Now she is gone: and tel him she's retir'd On purpose, till a hasty vow be past: And frame a Letter in her dearest name Shall keep his Love from chilling. Cald. 'Tis excellent. Ler. He must not know she's lost. Cald. Not for the world. Ler. By that time, Fate will send her me again; For those above, all know my Title to her; She is my Child, Caldroon, but such a one As can raise sorrow above Natures pitch. Prethee observe, Caldroon, how other Fathers Mourn for lost Children; then thou wou't see I do not talk so idly as thou think'st; But in this loss, I must not loose my self And whine to nothing: I'le to the King. Enter the King and Medina, D'Alva, Alcara, and Bruchero, whispering to him, and Medina showing Papers: the King sad and expressing amazement angerly, and so passes over the stage. Cald. He comes. Ler. But with a Guard, I like not. Cald. We are undone. Ler. He wou'd not look upon me once, While round about him, all my Enemies. Whisper'd destruction to me. Cald. All's out, I fear. Ler. Base Prince; By Heaven, Caldroon, he has forgot her; How easily his fond and childish Love Threw the fine thing away, that it so cry'd for The memories of Princes are but Graves Where Beauty, and where merit lie forgotten. Cald. Think of your self, my Lord. Ler. When the thick crowd of thoughts for lost Maria Will leave the least way open, then I will; Oh, she had eyes, Caldroon, I hope she has, That did, and may, yet look him into nothing. Cald. Cou'd we but find her. Ler. She cannot be conceal'd, she is too glorious, Had she been coupl'd with some rough-hewn slave, Her Language wou'd have play'd upon his soul And charm'd him into dot ge, if she had griev'd Like an Idolater he wou'd have gather'd Her tears upon his knees, for sacred Relicks. But had he lost her thus, thus as she's lost He wou'd have searcht her out, or else destroy'd All that he could suspect, and then himself. But this sick shadow of a Lover That whin'd, and pin'd away in passion for her, Is like a School-boy, glad to be releas'd From a hard Lesson. Cald. Here's more Company. Ler. The worst is come already, and the rest lookt for. Enter Medina, D'Alva, Alcara, Bruchero, with Angelo led prisoner by an Officer, with a white staffe and a Guard attending. Med. You shall have more company Seignior AngeloâDo your Office, Algazil. Algaz. Roderigo del Caldroon, I Arrest thee In the name of Philip, King of Spain. Cald. I obey it, we are o're-taken. Ler. Medina I will answer the Arrest. Med. Your case is not much better, You will be summon'd Lerma. Exeunt. Ler. Why then I will appear, Medina; You'r a kind Brother. Cou'd I turn all my passions into Curses And make 'em as effectual as my sorrows They might, perhaps, destroy the proudest of 'em; And yet my well-propt heart shall bear it all, He only is above Envy and Fate Whose mind in sinking Fortunes keeps its height. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. Scene I. Lerma appears, as in his house, with a Letter in his hand; two men bringing in a Coffer after him, opens a door, and they place it in. Ler. Here, set that Treasure in, for they are Reliques And will preserve their faithful worshipper; Why, here are mysteries Canonical, That must not be searcht into by disputes; 'Twas a good purchace too, considering The deep necessity; or if compar'd To the vast sums I gave my Instruments To turn them Feinds, and make my selfe a Devil, For I am Sainted at a cheaper Rate Thanks to his Holiness, my pack of Councellors I have out-gone you all; but to my Letter. he Reads. My LORD, This Coffer holds your wishes, and the full salutes from Rome: your Money is return'd as promised: I have at Naples here, met news so fearful, has alter'd all my purposes: I have serv'd you faithfully, pay it to my memory; you are secure, and I preserv'd from shame, by a death of my own chusing poyson. So farewell, no more yours, nor any more Toledo. Kind man, that with such pious Charity Sav'd me the Labour; he knew I honour'd him And wou'd not have his Life laid to my charge, But Piously he took it from himself; Where's such another Churchman? For Caldroon, by this time he is going after him I wou'd the Bishop had but taught the slave His Wise, and charitable way of dying, But where's Maria? I dare not ask my selfe, For I, alas, can't tell, and Heaven will not; Where is its Mercy then? for it ne'r had Another way to Bless, but by Maria. Could my prophane and passionate Revenge Reach but the Hearts and Lips of the Religious; No Incense evermore shou'd upward fly, Of Prayer or Praise; I'de stop all Piety Sing here. Till they restor'd Maria, to meâharkeâ I hear some noiseâha? what's this? Enter Caldroon, going to Execution, led by two Fryars; a Fryer going before, carrying a Crucifix; after follows others of several Orders, every one with a wax Taper in his hand; they pass round the Stage, singing his Funeral Dierge. After they go out, Medina enters with a Guard. Ler. Oh, are you come? what Tempest now? Med. How do you like the sight you saw? Ler. What the Pageant? I did not like it. Med. I thought so. Ler. I was vext to see how the poor slave Hung down his head, he shou'd have laught at you. Med. This heavy spectacle was meantâ Ler. To frighten me? Med. No, to prepare and touch thy Conscience Before thy Summons which I here pronounce; Charles Duke of Lerma, the Council do command In the Kings name, that you appear immediately To answer Articles prefer'd against you. Ler. Philip, Duke of Medina, I dare come. Med. Your impudence was never question'd. Ler. Nor shall my confidence be shaken by you. This was no kind Office for a Brother. Med. Where I find vertue, there I own Alliance, But I still persecute ignoble Acts, though Against him that wou'd be call'd my Brother. Ler. Wou'd be call'd? Take thy disdain'd Alliance back again I do despise to plead the chance of Nature To give me Title or pretence to any thing. And if you are such as you talk, your selfe, You might more nobly have persu'd those Actions, That you Count Ill: I always wore a sword, And do so now. Med. I love not to be urg'd to draw my sword Though that of Justice is much fitter now To strike at thee, which is so sure and sudden, That thy pretended Courage is despair. Yet, now I think on't better, 'tis an Honour To be thy Executioner. draws. Ler. I did not think yet to have found Medina A poor malicious Enemy, cou'd you believe That I have lost my Courage with my Fortunes, But to take off your mean ignoble scruple, Know Medina, that at this time, my life Is as secure as thine, by Heaven it is. Enter Alcara. Thou rob'st not greedy Justice of a morsel. Alca. What's this? the Guard there, hoa? Ler. What, betray'd? Alca. How now, my Lord? suffring a Traytor With a Sword drawn upon you. Med. My Lord, you are mistaken. Alca. The Council call for you, and are Just going to Sir, and immediately expect Your Prisoners Appearance. Med. My Lord, I'le follow you. Alca. I must not leave him Arm'd. Med. Take my Honour, my Lord, there shall be Nothing done, he is my Brother, and as farr As Justice gives me leave, I'de use him Nobly. Alca. The Guard, my Lord, must wait in sight. Med. As you please; but he and I must have Some words in private. Alca. Upon the engagement of your Honour. Nothing but words shall pass, I leave you. Exit. Med. My Lord, you have it, I'le follow presently. You see we are prevented. Ler. You have dealt Nobly, and I am calme again; Only, I wou'd beg leave to tell you a little tale Before you go. There was a man, Whose Pious Love to Honour, made him forget Friends and Alliance: such Chymera's Has brought on Cruelties in your cousen'd mind That Nature startles at, and the forc't World Who make advantage on your formal dotage Condemns you for that ruine which they wish; And call it cruelty in you to bring it. Med. You are a subtle Sophister, and might Talke a believing Fool from his just ends. Ler. Why, Did you never try in all this time To teach my heart in private, and direct it; And where you found a wound like a good Chyrurgeon Search it to cure, and not to kill your Patient. Med. Away. Ler. The love of vertue reaches not to Ruine And all will judge your course thus violent (But such as flatter you for their own ends) To be your hate to me; not love to vertue. Med. I'le hear no more. Ler. It's true, perhaps I am my self an Ocean, And mingled something dangerously by fortune, And yet but only gently whisper'd to: I am as calme as Nature undisturb'd In sleeping Infants; but when loud breaths Blow me to stormes, I care not then who sinkes, Med. I trifle time to hear thee: The houre of your Appearing's come, make hast, Or you'le be fetch't by common Officers: So farewel, I fear you foole your self with hopes. (Exit. Ler. He's gone; he durst not stay to hear me; He did begin to melt: good natur'd Gentleman. I love to try Mens tempers to laugh at 'em; For I shou'd hardly trust a promis'd kindness. I will not beg, that can command my peace; He that secures himself well in the end, Must destroy foes, and never trust a friend. (Exit. Scene II. Enter Medina, D' Alva, Alcara, and Bruchero, ready to sit as in Judgment. Med. I hope my Lords I have deserv'd your thanks. D' Alva. And all the Nations. Bru. Caldroon and Angelo did hardly thank you: The Ants had pil'd a mighty heap of Treasure. Alca. No newes my Lord yet of your Neice? Med. Not any. D' Alva. She has show'd a vertue in this close retreat Beyond all Story. Med. I do confess I'm glad I was mistaken; I thought her worse then she has prov'd. Alca. The King they say begins to have suspitions That she's convey'd away by some of us. Med. That fancy will be nourisht in his minde By Lerma's creatures, we must haste the Tryal. Alca. All's ready, see the King. Enter the King. A Cloud of sadness gathers on his calmness; He seemes disturb'd. D' Alva. Sir.â King. What, you wou'd make excuses for the fact, Or, Wou'd you own it for a Pollitick vertue? D' Alva. What fact Sir? King. Dare you aske me what? or do you think I am too young, not grown up to a King? Alca. We do beseech your Majestyâ King. To give you leave to be all Kings, and Tyrants Of my affections; you ravishers of vertue, Either restore Maria to the VVorld, Or all go suddenly, and lose your selves. Med. Does your Majesty believe?â King. Yes I do, that all great men Have jealous envies, equal unto Rivalls; And all the courted beauty is ambition, Hid under Justice, which, take heed you follow, And closely too, or ye shall all feele mine: So you may sit, but I will watch your actions. (Exit. D. Alva. This is unhappy. Med. It will be more, unless we now embrace The opportunity: Come let us sit And call the VVitnesses. Enter Izabella. How now, VVhat's the newes with you? Iza. I wou'd speak with the King. Med. From whom? Iza. Maria. Med. VVhat's your business? Iza. 'Tis onely for his Eares. Med. How Izabella, are you grown her servant? Iza. I am a Servant to her vertues. Med. And so brought a vertuous Message? Iza. My Lord, you may say what you please. Med. But you must not go; unless you first Tell me the businessâWher's Maria? Iza. I must tell neither. Med. Ha, Did not I intrust you? Iza. And so does she, and Ile be just to both: Pray stop me not. Med. Sure Izabella you forget your self, And what I am? Iza. But not what I ought to be. Med. Go back I say, and tell that counterfeit Maria, She shall not save her Father, with the loss Of her own PrinceâgoâNay, no help. Iza. Then I must speak. Med. Put her out, and from henceforth I do disowne my blood in thee too. Iza. This is Cruelty, not Justice. Med. Stop her mouth; out with her. (Puts her out. D' Alva. What's the matter my Lord? Med. Nothing but a Tale-bearer dispatch't Away. Alca. I have seen her sure. Med. It may be so: Come, we trifle time; Sit my Lords, and call the VVitnesses. Enter Catalina and Antonio. Med. Antonio, you are ready to averr Your own Confession, made at several time. Anto. My Lords I am. Med. The Heads of your Confession made out, The Queens death, and your reward; and how At last your own death was design'd. Anto. All this I am ready at large to testifie And prove. Med. Your Father was a worthy man, And you were more unfortunate then safe; Your proofes fair, Catalina, I know will be as steady as you virtues. Enter a Messenger: (The King appears above, Is Lerma come? Mess. He has refus'd to come the common way, And is descending by the private Lobby. D' Alva. That private way is not for Traitors. Med. Envy him not my Lords, 'tis the last time That his proud humor shall be satisfied; I doe believe he knowes not what he does, But like a tir'd o're-hunted Deere, Treads fatal pathes offer'd by chance, And not design'd by him. Enter Lerma in a Cardinal Habit. (They cry Roome. Harke, he comesâhaâWhat's this A Vision? D' Alva. A Maske I think, not an Arraignment. Alca. He has o're-reacht us all. Ler. I see you are amaz'd my worthy Lords, To find your loves to vertue made so useless, As not to practice your admir'd Justice: Perhaps you are so fond of that faire Mistriss, As that it mingled passion with your actions, But now you may discharge your manag'd witnesses That stand prepar'd against the Duke of Lerma, Lerma the Cardinal cannot here be Try'd: Be not so dull my Lords, it showes uncharitable, An envious malice will be thought the Father Of such a sadness: nothing but ruine please you? Med. D'ee come here to Raile? Ler. No, to Preach, it is my Office. I did no sooner touch this Sacred Habit, But I was fill'd with Notions. D' Alva. The Devil helpes thee to 'em. Ler. Still so uncharitable? D' Alva. Dost thou name any thing that's good? Ler. Ha, ha, ha! Med. Are you so merry too? Ler. Why, VVou'd you have me whine, and beg from you A thing you never had; and which I need not? He that seekes safety in a States-mans pitty, May as well run a Ship upon sharp Rockes, And hope a Harbour: nay, if you are so dull, Youle make me laugh again: 'tis not ill sport To see your cruel aimes thus lost and cozen'd. Cou'd you believe, I meant to die so tamely, And quench the thirst of your ambitious envies With my desired blood? This Holy Robe tells me, it is my duty, And I forgive: but sure I may laugh at you. Med. Impudence; Stand off. Let us consult. They whisper. Ler. Doe, whistle out your Braines. The Councill will run mad; they are angry, I wou'd not take their way to Heaven. I must Preach Patience to 'em: Now for an Oracle. Med. You know 'tis in our power to confine you Ler. In that I have as well prevented you: Here's the Assignment of a Holy Prison By my own choice, and granted by his Holiness, In that faire Monastery I Rais'd my self. Med. Subtle Devil. Ler. I will not longer trouble you my Lords, But leave you now to prey upon your selves. He that devoures the rest, in time may be A monster, more o'regrown then ere I was. When you are low, and poor, you are all friends, And in one fair pretence together joyn, While every one conceales his own design. It is your Countreys cause untill full grown In long sought power, then it proves your own. When youseem good, your Crimes are not the less, Men have all new Creations by success. Ambition like a wanton Womans hast, Invites new slaves, grown weary of the last. Mankind each others stories do repeat, And man to man is a succeeding cheat. So to this fate I leave you, and shall joy, To see those Crimes you blame, your selves destroy. May you all sink in fates for me you meant, And be too dull, your ruines to prevent; That when you'r lost in this Ambitious toile, I in my safe retreate may sit and smile. (Exit. D' Alva. Here's a strange change: thankes to his Holiness. Alca. We may blush to be thus cozen'd. Med. Methinks the greatness of his spirit stird me, I cou'd almost forgive him. Enter Maria led by Nunnes, and Izabella. She Discovers. What, More Masquerades; How Maria? Mar. Where, or to whom, shall I now bend My almost worne out knees? Alass the Deity, From whom I shou'd hope mercy, is not here: How short are Kings of gods? they'r every where (She weepes. King. Maria on her knees? Dare they suffer her to kneele (Above, and Descends. To whom I bow? Mar. How durst you to a King shut up the way? Shou'd Saints denie a wretched soul to pray? Did I your safeties with such care designe For you to take the life, that gave me mine. Med. Her sorrow moves. D' Alva. Here Vertue more; rise fair Maria. Mar. Speak, must my Father dye? if it be so We'll both together to my Mother go. D' Alva. Fair vertuous Maid, your Father lives. Enter the King hastily Med. Ha! the King. King. Maria. Tell me the wretch, that ravisht thee from me, That my Revenge, great as his crime may be. Mar. When you your Sacred Word to me did give, My Father by your Mercy still shou'd live, I stole away that you might be left free To be as just, as merciful to me: And durst not else, but unto those above In Prayers for you, confess my secret Love. King. Your Father is preserv'd from danger, free, And sav'd himself that had been sav'd by me. He in a Holy Robe is now retir'd, By danger urg'd, by Heaven I hope inspir'd. Mar. What an excess of blessings Heaven can give? Oh happy Father, that does more then Live! With joy now to my Sacred Cell I'le go; I shou'd not weep, but my fond tears will flow. My Zeal it self has a temptation too, I scarce shall pray for any thing but you. King. If you, in leaving me so cruel prove, Your Prayers will be as useless as your Love. Mar. Time, Sir, alas, will in a little space An Image drawn but faintly, quite deface. Love, like a shadow, while youth shines, is shown, But in old Ages darkness, there is none. King. But all pure Love, like glow-worms heatless fires Lives where it shines, and with that life expires. Beauty, like Time on Dials, moves so slow That they who always gaze, can't see it goe. Mar. But I must now leave Heaven, Sir, or you. King. The choice were easie, were the question true. Mar. Is not Heaven then the best felicity? King. But you as well may go to Heaven with me. Mar. 'Tis hard, thorow the world to find the way, If I talk long, I shall my self betray; Your Joys I Study, and deny my own; Shou'd Lerma's Daughter, share your Bed and Throne; Farewell, Sir, when you think of this, confess, I lov'd you, far beyond my happiness. King. Stay yet, and hear this vow going out. Spains empty Throne; Unless from you shall want succession. Med. Now, by my Sisters blessed soul, I share Between her Vertues, and my Kings Despair; Maria, stay, you must to Duty bow. D' Alva. You sav'd us all, preserve you Nation now. Alca. That vertue still may flow from you, their Spring. Bru. And make a Nation happy with their King. Mar. What shou'd I do? King. âDeferre your cruel thought, Till by my grief you are more pitty taught. Mar. This, Sir, is to o'recome the easiest way, My Forces will all lessen by delay, Yet, Sir, in this I must submit to you And Heaven, to teach my heart what's best to do. King. Till thenâ Let all that Love me, in my troubles joyn, And let their griefs, Allegiance pay to mine. Let not a smile upon a face be seen Till fair Maria yields to be my Queen. FINIS.</field>
