      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, A VILLAGE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Chamber: Goosecap is discover'd, seated at a Table, leaning upon his Arm, in a pensive Manner. Sure never mortal, at my age, Was such a buzzard, such a calf: A man whom years should render sage! I know not which, to cry or laugh. In love at sixty-six! Oons! infamy should fix A brand on the crime: Is threescore a time, For beginning boyish tricks? Betty!—This is wond'rous civil. Betty!—How now! What the devil! Will she come, or will she not? No; she never heeds a jot, When I call, how long I wait: Well, I must submit to fate: I took her for my maid, but she Resolves she will my mistress be. SCENE II. Goosecap, Betty. Betty. Mercy upon us, here's a stir; Sure you have lost your senses, Sir. Goose. My breakfast, hussey. Betty. Time enough. Goose. You've let me bawl.— Betty. 'Twill cure your cough. Goose. You might have said you did not hear me. Betty. Why, was I deaf? Goose. Then don't you fear me? Betty. For what! to fear me you were made. Goose. Plague, fury, 'sdeath, you slut! you jade! Betty. Nay, hush, good master, hush; I vow and swear, I blush To hear you make this riot: Be quiet, Sir, be quiet; Submit, obey; 'Tis the wisest way; My word is your law, And should you with awe, Like Jove's imperial fiat: You surely grow forgetful; You're ugly, old, and fretful; And for what should I catch Such a fright, such a wretch, When of young, gay, and brave, If I would, I might have, With half a look, my net full? SCENE III. Goosecap, Betty, Simon. Goose. Here, Simon, fetch my hat and cane. Betty. What now, Sir? Goose. Simon! Betty. 'Tis in vain; You must not go abroad to day; You are not well, Sir. Goose. Give me way. Betty. I will not let you budge from hence. Goose. Must I then bear this insolence? Tell me, thou devil, whence it springs. Betty. Simon, take back your master's things. Simon. He bid me fetch them. Betty. That may be. But now he stays at home with me: He thought to go abroad. Goose. And will; I'm your, and my own master still. Simon, my hat, my cane, my cloak. Betty. Well, come, dear Sir, I did but joke; Since you're resolv'd, you shall go out; But must not leave me in a pout. Goose. I'll leave you in what way I please; And to do that your heart shall teaze; For, mistress vixen, hear but this: I'll marry. Betty. No. Goose. I will. Betty. No. Goose. Yes. Betty. If proper for the married life, I would myself become your wife. Goose. You! Betty. Yes, I. Goose. Dare you further urge Your boldness? Betty. Yes. Goose. I vow to George, She has a most alluring eye. Yet I will marry. Betty. Fye, fye, fye. Goose. I will, I will, by all that's bad; If there's a female to be had: Though her face be like a vizard, And she's crooked as an izard; Curs'd as curs, and old as Poles, I will marry her, by goles. There's my neighbour, Lady Blinker, Some a homely woman think her; She, 'tis true, has but one eye, And's a little thought awry, Yet with her I'll make a shift, To turn you, impudence, adrift. SCENE IV. Betty, Simon. Betty. Well, Simon, what's the best with you? Simon. Sir's in a passion. Betty. That's not new; I think he's in one ev'ry day: Come, have you nothing else to say? Simon. What should I say? Betty. Nothing to me. Simon. What! Betty. Nay, you best know that. Simon. (Laughing.) He, he! Betty. You might have wanted to unfold Your heart. Simon. I dare not be so bold. Betty. You love me, Simon, no disguise. Simon. Lord, who could tell you that? Betty. Your eyes. Simon. Well, since they've told you so, I do. Betty. You would be glad to kiss me too: Say, am I right or am I wrong? Come, kiss me, Simon. Simon. Get along: You're making game of me, I know. Betty. Not I; come, kiss. Simon. But may I tho'? Betty. Try. Simon. That I will; she breathes, I vow, For all the world like any cow. I'll try again, if you desire. Betty. And welcome. Simon. Lord, I'm all on fire! Betty. Now, Simon, these delights are sweet; But let's be cautious and discreet: Th'old gentleman you know loves me; However, I love you, d'ye see, And mean to leave him in the lurch. Simon. And when shall us be ax'd in church? Betty. Next week, perhaps. Simon. And not before? Betty. Have patience; what would you have more! I say I'll marry you. Simon. Good Lord! One kiss.— Betty. But mum now. Simon. Not a word. I am, 'tis true, but a servant boy, And small the wages I get; But more than riches she shall enjoy, If I can prevail upon Bet: I'll make up for wealth, With youth and with health, And love a precious store; Despise then the life, Of a gentleman's wife, And chuse to be happy and poor. SCENE V. Betty. To marry master are you bent, You first shall stay for my consent: I have not taken all this pains, To let another count my gains: But, how to frustrate the old fool! I'll make this bumpkin here my tool, Pretend with him to drive a match; My master will, like wild-fire, catch The tidings, and be strait in flame; And then leave me to play my game. Men are wily, men are cunning, Still in wait our sex to catch; But, their subtle mazes running, Now and then they meet their match. Shame, dear girls, those vile undoers', Schemes with deeper schemes o'er-reach; Boldly turn on your pursuers, And foil them with the arts they teach. SCENE VI. Changes to a Street; on one Side, the Old Lady's House; on the other Side, Goosecap's. Goosecap enters with the Old Lady. Goose. In short, this, madam, is my plan; Would you a husband, I'm your man: You are not handsome, nor yet young, But on that theme I hold my tongue; And, if you take me, you shall find I'll prove a help-mate true and kind. O. Lady. Are you in earnest, Sir? Goose. In troth. O. Lady. Nay, I'll believe, without your oath; And, since you make so fair an offer, I will not vainly slight the proffer: I am not over young, 'tis true; And, let me say, no more are you; And, if I have no charms to spare, Your beauty, Sir, is nothing rare. Goose. Men's years and features are no matter; And mine may pass, or some folks flatter. Say, will you have me, ay or no? O. Lady. I will, Sir; I have told you so. Goose. Then, madam, yield to my request; Yonder's my house; few words are best, When folks are fix'd in their design. Come with me there to day, and dine; A bit of mutton, en famille, And afterwards we'll sign and seal. O. Lady. But, are you not too much in haste? Goose. Why should we time in courtship waste? O. Lady. Nay, as you please; but then, I must Step in, my head-dress to adjust. Goose. I'll wait your coming, madam, here; But let me lead you, pray. O. Lady. O dear! You gentlemen are so polite! But, pray, no farther stir; You shan't, I vow; you shame me quite; Your humble servant, Sir. But, Mister Goosecap, hark'e; Pray, did I rightly mark you? To-morrow did you say, Should be your wedding-day? Well, let it if you will; In all that's just and right, You'll find me day and night, Your most obedient still. SCENE VII. Goosecap; Betty and Simon enter behind; and afterwards the Old Lady. Goose. Well, after all, now, by this light, That which my neighbour says is right: Gad, she's a woman of good sense; Virtuous, and not without the pence; And as for beauty, 'tis a dream, All women soon become the same. Betty. Here, Simon, we must both stand ready; I saw him talking with my lady; But he's as cunning as old nick, And I suspect some mummer's trick. Simon. Let us go nearer. Betty. Hold! take heed! Goose. Beauty is but a dream, indeed! And youth a flow'r that soon decays. Betty. He's talking. Simon. Hark! Betty. What is't he says? Simon. Something, I could not hear, could you? Betty. No; listen, and observe your cue. Goose. I never was half so well pleas'd in my life. How came I before not to think of a wife? Odds rabbits and niggers, the more I reflect, It is the best measure, For profit and pleasure, I could have adopted, in every respect. Betty. And so you shall find in effect. Goose. Mistress Betty shall see, And that to her sorrow, By this time to-morrow, I can be as headstrong as she. Simon. Odds my life this is no mumming, Here's the gentlewoman coming, Dress'd as fine as fine can be. Betty. All bedizened, Perfum'd, poison'd! A. 2. O, she is a fine lady. O. Lady. My confusion is so great, Sir; I'm afraid I've made you wait, Sir. Goose. Not at all, ma'am; Take the wall, ma'am, And oblige me with your hand. O. Lady. Sir, I'm all at your command. Betty. Hold, Sir, if you please, permit me, In my office, to acquit me. Fal, lal, lal, lal, lal, lal, loo. By your leave and stand aside there; Room for Mister Goosecap's bride there. O. Lady. Who are these? Do you know who? Goose. Betty, I've a mind to beat you. A. 2. Both your servants come to meet you. Betty. With low curtsies, ma'am, I greet you. Goose. Get you gone, you devils, do. O. Lady. Mister Goosecap, maid or wife, Never was I, in my life, Treated with so much ill manners. A. 2. Cupid, Hymen, spread your banners. March before this happy pair. Love and beauty, 'Tis our duty. Goose. Slut! Dog! Tell me how you dare— O. Lady. Use this freedom. Goose. Never heed them; I'll chastise them, you may swear. A. 2. Husband rare! Charming fair. Betty. Fa, ra, la, ra, la, ra, la. Simon. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. O. Lady. Don't you see me made their scorn? Were your offers t'amuse me? Did you bring me to abuse me? Had I thought I was brought— Goose. Oh, that ever I was born! Stay, my lady, I am ready. O. Lady. Laugh'd at, banter'd! Goose. Is't my fault? Simon. Master yonder's quite astonish'd. O. Lady. For that slut I'll have her punish'd; Laid in Bridewell as she ought. Betty. Fa, ral, la, ra, la, ra, la. Simon. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. A. 4. Such a scene, As this has been, Sure no mortal ever saw. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Hall in Goosecap's House. Goosecap enters, driving Simon in before him, with his Cane. Simon. Help! help! here, hold, Sir, go no further; Icod you'll make me cry out murder; And if I do— Goose. What then? Simon. Why, then, You may repent. Goose. Take that again; A stroke or two will never kill you. Simon. Once more, I say, be easy, will you? What have I done? Goose. You dog, you knave, What have you done! you ought to have Your ears cut off for your assurance; And then at least a twelve-months durance. Simon. Why so? Goose. To laugh, and make your sport Of your superiors in such sort; A lady too of wealth and fashion; But let me not give way to passion: Come, sirrah, strip yourself with speed, And quit my house. Simon. I shan't, indeed. Goose. No, instantly, I say, depart. Simon. Well, then, I will, with all my heart. But is not Betty to go too? Goose. You jackanapes, what's that to you? However, let her too be gone; Two plagues I'm rid of, 'stead of one. Dost hear; tell Betty she may go: It will be ten times better so. But one thing still is to be settled: I know my lady is high mettled; And her resentment, I'm afraid, Will not be easily allayed: But what of that, though hard the task, When I forgiveness humbly ask? Yes, yes, success my mind presages; Call Betty down, to take her wages. A bear that has been long confin'd, And hamper'd in a chain, If freedom he should gain, From his den comes out, Unmuzzles his snout, Ope's wide his jaws, Extends his paws, With pleasure growls, And jumps and rolls, In ecstacy about. I am myself the bear; Odds bobs I could tread in air; Since liberty I've got, I could dance a rigadoon, Leap over the moon, And do, I know not what. SCENE II. Simon, Betty. Betty. Is that my master there gone out? Simon. Your master! here has been a rout. Betty. Pooh, blockhead, never mind what he says. Simon. Cod, I've been almost lick'd to pieces, For what we said to that old cat; And there's still worser news than that; He has turn'd off both you and I: Fore George it aint a word o'lie: He bid me tell you to get ready; And now he's gone to seek my lady, To try to make it up with her; I'm sad and serious, never stir. Betty. Simon, come hither. Simon. Here am I. Betty. Some other method I must try: Storming, I find, will fruitless be. Simon. Did mistress Betty speak to me? Betty. I did. Simon. I thought so; pray what is it? Betty. Master is gone again to visit The wither'd beldame, o'er the way. Simon. To kiss and friends, I heard him say: I warrant they'll be here anon. Betty. Then, Simon, you and I'll be gone. Simon. Gone! Where? Betty. From hence. Simon. Together, eh! Betty. Just as you please. Simon. As I please? Betty. Nay, When folks are married there's no harm. Simon. No, to be sure. Betty. Well, don't alarm The family about it now. Simon. But tell me where, and when, and how. Betty. Within this hour we'll settle all; Only be ready, at my call, To come and claim your better half. Simon. Icod, I cannot chuse but laugh, To think how mad old Sir will be, To see us wed, as well as he. At the same church too, the same day, Shan't us? Betty. Why, ay; perhaps we may. Simon. In the morning, what a dinging, With the parish bells a ringing, And the rattling of the drums: Then besure the music comes; Fiddles, bass, and sweet hautboy. All to wish the bride-folks joy. But plague o'your horn, 'Tis not not to be borne; Oh, silence that ominous sound: Play, instruments play; Drums rattle away, And let it for ever be drown'd. SCENE III. Betty, Goosecap. Goose. So, mistress Betty, are you there? I really wonder how you dare Look in my face; have you forgot? Say, were you mad, bewitch'd, or what, That you behav'd so ill just now? Answer me. Betty. Sir, I don't know how; My silence may explain my terror; I can but blush, and own my error. Goose. It really was a horrid shame. Betty. No doubt, Sir, I was much to blame; But cannot you the cause unriddle? Goose. What cause? Betty. Love, jealousy. Goose. A fiddle! Betty. My conduct might be out of season; But passion quite o'erpower'd my reason. Goose. You should have kept it more confin'd; Howe'er, her ladyship's so kind, She pard'ns the slights were thrown upon her; And, shortly, I expect the honour, To have her company within; We quickly too shall be a-kin; The happy words, to have and hold, One flesh will make us. Betty. Sir, I'm told, You're pleas'd that I should go away. Goose. No, Betty, you are free to stay Till we are married. Betty. That's enough. Goose. She faints! here, take a pinch of snuff: A glass of water! Betty. There's no need. Your hand, Sir, pray. Goose. She's ill, indeed; But, if she sees I'm touch'd, she'll make Advantage of it. Betty. Thus, I take My last farewell; a tear, a sigh, You must permit. Goose. (Half crying.) Betty, good bye. Betty. I go to die, with grief o'erladen; If you my grave should chance to see, Look on't, and say, here lies a maiden, Who died, alas! for love of me. Tears force their way; forgive my sobbing; I scarce have power my words to speak; If I stay longer, sure, with throbbing, My heart will here before you break. Aha! old codger, is it so? He squeez'd my hand, the sign I know; He still is fast within my pen. What silly animals are men! SCENE IV. Goosecap, Betty, Old Lady. O. Lady. Bless me, what's this! upon my word, Here are delightful doings t'ward! Lock'd hand in hand, and both in tears, A pair or tender parting dears: You said you had discharg'd that minx; You might have done so, Sir, methinks, Before you had persuaded me.— Goose. Madam, she goes, as you shall see: Betty, about your business strait. Leave me, do'st hear? O. Lady. You need not wait For packing up your trinkums, child: We'll send them after you. Betty. (Aside.) All's spoil'd: My hopeful scheme's at once destroyed By her intrusion. O. Lady. Wench, avoid Our presence quickly. Goose. Betty, do. Betty. Yes, Sir; but first a word with you. Goose. With me! O. Lady. Speak out then. Betty. So I meant: I only would ask your consent, In duty bound.— O. Lady. For what? Goose. Nay, tarry. Have patience; my consent! Betty. To marry! Goose. Marry! it must not be. O. Lady. Why not? Goose. Nay, not that I'm concern'd a jot: But who is the deluding cur? Betty. A footman, at your service, Sir. He's in the kitchen; shall I call him? Goose. Do, instantly, that I may maul him; But, Betty, I'm asham'd to think You so below yourself should sink. Betty. Alas! in vain I try'd, Sir, To quench a flame so tender; So artfully he ply'd, Sir, I only blush'd and sigh'd, Sir, And languish'd to surrender. A thousand matchless graces, His person are adorning, More beautiful his face is, Than dawn of summer's morning. SCENE V. Goosecap, Old Lady, and afterwards Betty, introducing Simon. Goose. Who can this be she means to wed? I think she loves him too she said: The false ungrateful— O. Lady. Tell me, Sir, What do you mean by all this stir? Indeed, so mov'd! Goose. I will, I swear, Come to the bottom of th'affair. O. Lady. You think me then not worth an answer? You are a very ill-bred man, Sir. Goose. Madam, excuse me, pray; I find Myself, just now, disturb'd in mind. Hey-day! What's here? Who's this I see? Betty. My husband, Sir, that is to be. How do you like him? Simon. Sir, I'm yours. Goose. Mine, dog! This instant out of doors! Betty, is he your choice? Betty. I hope, You find him worthy— Goose. Of a rope! Rascal, I say, let go her hand! Simon. For what? O. Lady. I am able to command My rage no longer. Goose. Let her go. O. Lady. Sir, Mr. Goosecap, do you know How you're behaving to me here? Goose. Betty! my life! my soul! my dear! Turn that young jackanapes away: I'll marry you. O. Lady. Hum! Betty. When? Goose. To-day. Try, madam, to prevail upon her. O. Lady. I! Betty. Will you tho'? Goose. Upon my honour. Betty. Then, Simon, by your leave. Simon. Hey! how! Are you false-hearted? Where's your wow? Betty. Gone. Simon. Then, by Jove, I've well got shut. Betty. But, here's a wife. O. Lady. You saucy slut! Pray, Mr. Goosecap, tell me this; Are you resolv'd to wed her? Goose. Yes— O. Lady. And is't behaving as you ought? Goose. 'Tis my misfortune, not my fault; I cannot help it. Betty. Will you stay, And be a bride-maid? Goose. Do, ma'am, pray. O. Lady. You numpscul, you ideot, you grey-headed ass, Who is she? who are you? who am I? do you know? At this time of day, men are come to that pass, They're vainer and sillier the older they grow. At your time of life, Is this a fit wife? To a dark room and straw, thou poor lunatic go. A word too in your ear, She'll horn her dearest dear; She will, Sir, indeed, Believ't as your creed: I can your fortune tell; And to-morrow you'll see A lawyer from me; And so, Sir, fare-you-well. SCENE VI. Goosecap, Simon, Betty. Simon. And, Mistress Betty, now we're cool, Is't thus you serve me— Goose. Out you fool. Simon. I'll be reveng'd for't, never stir. Betty. Come, you must raise his wages, Sir.— A better mistress than a wife You'll find me, Simon. Goose. Here, my life, Receive my hand. Betty. And take you mine. A. 2. Darts, flames, joy, ecstacy divine! Goose. My heart's a forge where Beauty's son, Young Cupid and his mam are; There his darts she moulds, And the anvil holds; The little urchin beats them on, Ton, ton, ton, ton. Hark! don't you hear his hammer? Betty. We always find our parish clock To the same motion sticking. So my heart's to you In its motion true: First at my breast you made it knock, Toc, toc, toc, toc: Hark! don't you hear it clicking? Goose. My love! Betty. My dove! Goose. My chicken. Do you love me now? Betty. So well, I vow, Words are to weak to tell you how. Goose. Good lack! Betty. I'fack! A. 2. What is it ails me? Somewhat assails me, That thrills and disorders; 'Tis pleasure that borders On pain. Yet I swear by this kiss, And by this, and by this, I'd rather endure it, Than soften or cure it, And cherish it while I complain. Goose. Now I'll go buy the wedding-ring. A. 2. And then we'll love, and dance and sing, And frisk and play, Both night and day, Like any thing. SCENE VII. Goosecap, Betty, Simon, Old Lady Betty. Bless me, her ladyship comes back. Goose. No matter, 'tis some new attack. Well, madam, your commands speak out. O. Lady. I hope I'm welcome. Betty. Without doubt. O. Lady. I'm reconcil'd to our miscarriage, And came to laugh, Sir, at marriage. Goose. Laugh, ma'am! Betty. 'Tis neither shame nor sin. O. Lady. No, no; and when you please begin. Goose. O mighty love, who can controul Thy influence o'er the human soul Thy power is felt from pole to pole, By victims great and many. You turn at will all people's wits, And make them mad and fools by fit; But still where'er thy arrow hits, The old fool's worse than any. O. Lady. Love is, in youth, a pleasing fruit, Does with the season aptly suit; And where its fertile branches shoot, With health and joy we're feasted: But love with age will never chime, 'Tis a tree bearing out of time, The fruit nor wholesome is nor prime, But sickens where 'tis tasted. Simon. In ancient fable we are told, Alcides of immortal mould, Did for a wench a distaff hold, And gravely sat to spinning. Think when the fool a master plays, And weds his maid, although he strays, He is no worse than Hercules; And pray, Sirs, spare your grinning. Betty. Folks may find fault with this and that, Say love with youth comes only pat, That youthful pairs give tit for tat, And all goes fine and clever. That age should prudent be and cold; But if men love not e'er they are old, Thus much to say, I will be bold, 'Tis better late than never. End of the Opera.</field>
