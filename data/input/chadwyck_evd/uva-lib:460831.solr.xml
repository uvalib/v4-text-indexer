      <field name="fulltext">Dedication, by Vittorio Alfieri, to THE CONSPIRACY OF THE PAZZI. TO THE FRIEND OF MY HEART, FRANCESCO GORI GANDELLINI, Citizen of Sienna, dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Lorenzo. Julian. Bianca. Guglielmo. Raymond. Salviati. Soldiers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe State-Palace of Florence.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Guglielmo, Raymond. Ray. To suffer, always suffer? oh my father, Is this the only counsel thou canst give me? Art thou become so thoroughly a slave, That thou no longer feel'st the heavy wrongs, The insults of the Medicean yoke? Gu. Oh, son, I feel all keenly; and far more I feel the public than my private wrongs. But yet what should I do? To such a pitch Florence by party-spirit is reduced, That the most inoffensive word may be Fatal to us, propitious to our tyrants. Oh infirm state! it is too evident, That thou canst now change only for the worse. Ray. Ah! tell me where is now the state? Or how, If there be one, it can be worse? Can we Be said to live? Live those, who full of fear, Who abject, and suspicious, drag along Their infamous and pining days? To us What injury can arise? That in the place Of shameful and inefficacious tears, Blood should perchance be shed? And what? Dost thou Call shedding blood the greatest injury? Thou, that, a thousand times, with noble joy, To me, a child, the ancient times recalledst, And execratedst these degenerate days; Thou now like every vulgar recreant here, Submittest to the yoke thy passive neck? Gu. There was a time, I seek not to deny it, When, urged by intolerance of our many wrongs, And full of anger, and elastic spirits, I would have sacrificed, without a thought, My wealth, my honours, and my life, to crush The usurpation of new tyrants, raised On our misfortunes: to the fire of youth All things seem easy; so they seemed to me. But finding to my great designs few friends, And those few friends of wavering constancy; Beholding every year that tyranny Struck deeper roots in this impoverished soil; And lastly being a father; all induced me, To safer, but less elevated schemes, To turn my thoughts. The tyrants would have found In me a weak, and ineffectual foe: Hence sought I their alliance. I bestow'd On thee their sister's hand. Since we no more Flourish'd beneath the shade of liberty; I hence would see thee, and thy future son Placed in the covert of the plumes, at least, Of tyranny's audacious, spreading wings. Ray. Protection infamous, and insecure. Bianca, although sister of the tyrants, Is thence not insupportable to me: Her, and the sons which she to me has given, Though nephews of the tyrants, I hold dear. My blameless wife I blame not for her brothers; Thyself I blame alone, in having mix'd Their blood with ours, oh father. In this act I would not thwart thy purpose: but at last Thou seest the fruits of such servility: By this alliance thou didst hope to reap Honour and influence; and we thence have reap'd Contempt, disparagement, and infamy. The citizens abhor us, and with reason; We are the tyrants' kinsmen; thence have they Exchanged their hatred towards us for contempt; And we, who were not citizens, deserve it.â Gu. Thou hadst found me, in other climes, oh son, A spur to illustrious deeds, and not a check. What it has cost my not ignoble heart To smother indignation, and to feign An insincere attachment, thou thyself Canst best conceive. E'en from thy infancy I have, 'tis true, discover'd in thy heart The seeds of irritable independence: At first, I must confess, I saw with joy This bias of thy soul; but far more oft I inwardly regretted, when in thee I contemplated afterwards a soul Too free and lofty. Thence it seem'd to me That the consummate sweetness of Bianca Was not ill qualified to mitigate Thy perilous impetuosity. At length thou wert a father; and art still so, As I am to my sorrow ... Ah! that I Had never been so! Then at once with her, And for her, had my country seen me die. Ray. And dared'st thou make me a father, where To be a father, is to be a slave? Gu. Ah then at least our servitude was doubtful. Ray. Our infamy indeed was less confirm'd ... Gu. 'Tis true; I hoped, since to our common wrongs, All remedies were fruitless and too late, That thou might'st pass thy days in quietness, Blest in a father's and a husband's feelings ... Ray. But, e'en though I were sprung from other blood, Can any being tranquilly enjoy Domestic transports in a place like this? I was not, no, assuredly to these Vain trappings of vain magistracy, born, Which make him seem the first who is the last. For this perchance the tyrants have to-day Assay'd to take them from me: trappings these, So much the more disgraceful, as they are The cloak of simulated liberty. 'Twas infamous to invest me with them; now 'Twill be as infamous to rob me of them: Oh, cursed destiny! Gu. Report of this Is spread; it even reached my ears; but I Cannot believe it, no ... Ray. Why not believe it? Have not they shewn us more offensive insults? Possessions seized, dost thou no more remember, Our statutes changed, alone to aim at us? Since we ignobly made ourselves their kinsmen, We've always been more exquisitely injured. Gu. Hear me, oh son: and to my hoary age, My long experience, trust. The just disdain Which in the deep recesses of my heart I also cherish, with rash impotence Exhaust not thou: we yet awhile may bear: I ne'er can think that they would take from thee A dignity conferr'd, whate'er it be.â But yet, should they all bounds of sufferance pass, Be silent thou: full oft revengeful words Defeat revengeful deeds. A lofty silence Is the precursor of a lofty vengeance. The courteous carriage of the tyrants towards us Gives thee a precedent for valid hate. Meanwhile, oh son, I would alone exhort, And teach thee, to endure ... Nor afterwards, Shall I disdain, if one day it be needful, To learn from thee how to direct the blow. SCENE THE SECOND. Raymond. ... I dare not trust in him ... Let Salviati First to these shores return.âMy father Discovers nothing of my purposes: He knows not that to-day it pleases me Rather to exasperate than appease these tyrants.â Ah father! would'st thou fain now be to me A master of endurance? Art thou he, Than whom thy country formerly had not A more intrepid champion? How propense, Gelid old-age, art thou to servitude!â Ah! if nought else by length of years is learn'd, But how to tremble, to obey, to endure, In silence to endure; rather than learn Such abject arts, I chuse the bitterest death. SCENE THE THIRD. Bianca, Raymond. Bi. Consort, at last I find thee. Ah, with whom Would'st thou be, if thou fliest e'en from me? Ray. Here, with my father, I at length conversed A short time since: but I have not thence gain'd Alleviation to my wrongs. Bi. He is, Though good in all things else, the best of fathers: He fears not for himself; but all his fears Are for his children roused. The generous old man Smothers, for us, the anger in his breast. Believe not, no, that valour is exhausted, Or intrepidity in him subdued: Ah! suffer then that I repeat it to thee; He is the best of fathers. Ray. Oh! perchance, Thou would'st insinuate that I am not like him? Thou know'st if nothing else avail'd, thy prayers Were ever potent to restrain my wrath; Thy prayers alone, Bianca, thy chaste love, And thy maternal tears. I esteemed thee Companion sweet, not sister of my foes ... But, does it seem to thee, to-day, that still I ought to hold my peace? To-day, decreed To see my forfeiture without pretext Of this my popular dignity? When we Are doomed as fugitives to quit this dwelling, Asylum sacred once to public freedom? Bi. Powerful they are; what boots it then with words To exasperate those who answer not, and act? Thy silence, better far than menaces, Might now appease them. Ray. And would I appease them? ... âBut to appease them nothing now avails ... Bi. Nothing? ... Of one blood am not I with them? ... Ray. I know it; and I grieve for it; be silent; Recall it not to mind. Bi. And what? For this, Art thou, or hast thou been, less dear to me? Am not I ready, if to endure their sway Is irksome to thee, wheresoe'er thou wilt To follow thee? or if thy haughty soul Scorn'd not to have in me a means of peace, Am I less ready for thyself to speak, To weep, to pray, and even, if I ought, By dint of force to make my brothers yield? Ray. To pray for me? and whom to pray to? tyrants?â Canst thou intend it, lady? and canst thou Expect that I permit it? Bi. Riches, power, Arms, partizans, hast thou, whence openly Thou canst make head against them? ... Ray. In my breast A hate I cherish, equal to their hate; Courage superior far. Bi. Alas! what say'st thou? Would'st thou perchance attempt? ... Ah! thou may'st lose Father, and consort, children, honour, life ... And what canst thou acquire? Within thy heart The flattering expectation cherish not: No genuine wish in this vile people lives For pristine austere liberty: from me Trust this assertion. Trust to me. I, born, And in the lap of nascent tyranny Brought up, all its dependencies I know. Tools thou wilt find by thousands and by thousands, In their discourse ferocious, in their deeds Contemptible, in time of danger nothing, Or skilful only in betraying thee. I am not so unnatural and cruel That I abhor my brothers; yet far less Have they been loved by me, since I have seen Their arrogance towards thee; that arrogance Galls my afflicted spirit. If I am Compell'd by thee to make the fatal choice 'Twixt thee and them, by thee I am a mother, Thy wife am I, thou art oppress'd, ... I cannot, Nor ought I hesitate. But thou, awhile, Do thou resolve on nothing: the enterprize To make thee, if not happy, safe at least, Leave it to me; let me at least attempt it. Or do I not perchance yet fully know How I, the consort of a citizen, Ought to address a tyrant? Yet perchance Do I not know how far I may unite To not invalid reasons, lofty prayers? Mother, wife, sister, am I not? In whom, If not in me, canst thou confide? Ray. Oh heaven! Lady, thy words afflict me. Peace would I Also obtain; but not with infamy. What to thy brothers could'st thou say for me? That I deserve not insult? Well they know it; Hence they insult me: that I brook not wrongs? Why make that known which only from my lips They ought to know? Bi. Ah! ... if to them thou speakest ... Alas! ... Ray. What fear'st thou? True it is, that I Can never change my soul: but, if I will, I can be silent. Thou, beloved Bianca, Thou, and my sons, are always in my thoughts: Impetuous, intolerant, audacious, If I was born, yet not on this account Do I let slip a word by accident: Compose thyself; I also wish for peace. Bi. Yet from thy countenace do I infer Thy heart is shaken by a frightful storm ... In thee I see no forerunners of peace. Ray. I am not joyful; but in me suspect not Cruel designs. Bi. I fear; yet know not why. Ray. Because thou lovest me. Bi. Oh heaven! ... and with What love! ... Ah! that the path to real fame Were opened to thee now! ... But we are doom'd To drag out life in a corrupted age. Submission is our glory; and self-love Our only virtue. What would'st thou effect? One man could not regenerate a people, And coadjutors here thou wilt not find. Ray. Hence I pine inwardly, and hence ... am silent. Bi. Ah come, and let us elsewhere turn our steps: My brothers sometimes place their judgment-seat In these apartments. Ray. This is the retreat, I know, in which to lying praise their ears They open, and their bosoms close to pity. Bi. Come then with me; and mingle with the poison That subtly creeps through every throbbing vein, Some soothing balsam. Thou hast not to-day Embraced our children yet. Ah come, I pray thee: And with their innocent and silent kisses Let them, far better than I can with words, Remind thee that thou art a father still. Ray. Ah, could I, as to-day I recollect The name of father, that of man forget!â But, let us now depart.âThou shalt have proof Whether my children are beloved by me.â Ah, thou know'st not, (and may'st thou never know) To what extremities his children drive A real father; how he may be goaded To their destruction by o'erweening fondness.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Julian, Lorenzo. Lo. Brother, what boots it? Thou hast hitherto Trusted to me: does it now seem to thee That, by my means, our influence is diminish'd? Thou talkest of restraining men? are these Restrain'd? If such had met with tolerance, Say, had we risen to our present greatness? Ju. 'Tis true, Lorenzo, a benignant star Shines on us hitherto. We owe in part To fortune our advancement; but still more To our forefather's lofty counsels owe it. Cosmo possess'd the state, but he possess'd it Under the semblance of a private man. Nor are the fetters yet so rivetted, That with the exterior of royalty We may securely grasp them. Let us leave To fools, who form the multitude, the vain Appearances of their lost liberty. In its commencement, arbitrary power, The less it is display'd, is more confirm'd. Lo. We have not yet obtain'd the height of greatness: We are summon'd by the present times, oh Julian, Rather to greatly dare, than nicely weigh. Cosmo already centred in himself His universal country; and by all, As with one voice, was welcom'd as a father. Little or nothing to the complex scheme Pier our father added: adverse fate Quickly cut short the few and feeble days That he survived his sire: he added little; But meanwhile he to Cosmo next succeeding, And we to Pier, something is obtain'd In thus accustoming the citizens To hereditary right. Our foes thenceforward Have been each day dispersed, enfeebled, slain; Our friends accustomed or constrained to obey; Now that all things invite us to complete Cosmo's magnanimous enterprize, shall we Be self-defeated by our cowardice? Ju. Wisely we ought to bring it to an end; But in a manner moderate and humane. Where gentle measures may effect our ends With cautious speed, inflexible, yet mild; And, when 'tis needful, sparingly severe. Brother, believe me, to eradicate Those seeds of liberty, by nature placed In every human breast, no little art, And management, besides a length of time, Are requisite: these seeds may be suppress'd, By spilling human blood, but not extinguish'd. And oftentimes from blood they shoot again With fresh luxuriance ... Lo. And do I wish To shed the blood of these? The axe in Rome Was Scylla's instrument; but e'en the rod Is too imposing here: my words alone Suffice to make them tremble. Ju. Blind reliance! Knowest thou not that none are to be fear'd Like men enslaved? Scylla dismiss'd his guards, Yet hence was he not slain; but girt with arms, With satellites, and mercenary spies, Nero, Domitian, and Caligula, And thousand others that have ruled o'er slaves, By their own minions butcher'd, fell ignobly. Why irritate those who obey already? Obtain thy end by other means. 'Tis true, The people here were never wholly free; But notwithstanding never slaves to one.â Thou should'st benumb their minds; and utterly Enervate their affections; each high thought Subtly eradicate; abolish virtue, Or wither it by making it a jest; Install among thy creatures the most pliant; Degrade, by honouring them, the falsely proud; Declaim in lofty and imposing tones Of clemency, of country, glory, laws, And citizens; and more than aught besides Affect equality with thy inferiors.â Behold the mighty means, by which in each Are changed by little and by little first The feelings, then the customs, thence the laws; Then the deportment of the ruler; last, That which alone remains to change, his name. Lo. Our ancestors with happy auspices Already have adopted all these measures: The foolish quarrels of the citizens, If now a link is wanting to the chain, Should fabricate that link. One, only one, Openly dares, in short, to brave our power; And ought he to be fear'd? Ju. Ferocious son Of disaffected father, Raymond gives Just ground for apprehension ... Lo. Both should be, (And for this project I address myself,) Blasted by scorn: e'en a revenge like that Would not be undelightful ... Ju. 'Tis not safe. Lo. Great as the project is, my mind is fix'd. I from his rank will take that turbulent youth; And suffer him to scatter at his will Seditious words in vain: thus all shall see How thoroughly I scorn his menaces. Ju. A foe offended, and not slain? At this, What bosom, e'en though mail'd with triple steel, Would tremble not? Should'st thou make him a foe Whom thou could'st extirpate? Why thus give him, Thyself, incautiously, so many pretexts To agitate the state? Why make him thus The head, and leader of the malecontents? And they are numerous; many, many more Than thou suspectest. Open force they have not? I trust that it is so: but who will guard Our back from treason? Will suspicion, say, Suffice for this? It may suffice to spoil Our quiet, not to give security. Lo. Audacity will be our best defence: Audacity to the enterprizing breast, Which is both sword, and intellect, and shield. A silent invitation I will give To the rebellious and impetuous youth To new offences. Afterwards disgraced, But not destroy'd by him who might destroy him, He to the multitude whom now he heads Will thus become an object of derision. SCENE THE SECOND. Lorenzo, Julian, Guglielmo, Raymond. Gu. Follow my footsteps, son; and I beseech thee Suffer me here to speak alone.âOh you, (For yet I know not by what epithet I ought to accost you) in a suppliant posture Behold me here your once implacable, And bitterest enemy. Better I know, Better adapted to my age infirm, Were free expressions, and still freer deeds; Nor with my nature, though I use them, do These servile ones accord. But I am not The only one remaining of my house; Whence to your fortune, and to tyrannous And base necessity, I long have yielded. Myself, my life, my substance, and my honour, My children, all did I confide to you; Nor was I more reluctant to obey Than others were. Thence can I scarce believe That which is now reported, that ye mean With wrongs unmerited to injure Raymond, And me in him. But grant, if this be true, That I demand of you the cause for this. Ju. Why from thy son dost thou not first demand The cause of his deportment, and his language? ... Ray. I refuse not to give account to him: Nor can I ever meet with those, to whom I would more freely, than to you, confess My purposes ... Lo. Thy purposes I know.â But I would teach thee, that, if thou would'st cope With those in pow'r, there's need of enterprize Proportion'd to thy envy; and not less Strength to that lofty enterprize proportion'd. Say; fares it so with thee? Gu. I hitherto Am chief of all our race; nor is there one Who dares to move, if I precede him not. I speak of deeds. And what, do ye likewise Pretend to sit in judgment on secret thoughts? Are ineffectual words high treason here? Are we so far advanced?âIf ye pretend To exercise a right like this, I ask you, That men may learn more abjectly to fear, What are you? Whence your charter to such power? Ray. What are they? Dost thou ask it? Do not they Tremendously, though tacitly, express it In their imperious and cruel faces?â Yes, they are all; and nothing we. Ju. We are The fearless guardians of the sacred laws; We are exterminating flames from heaven To culprits like thyself; but to the good Heart-cheering benefactors. Lo. In one word, Such are we as to hold thee in contempt. Our will to thee assign'd the gonfalon, Another will of ours more just recalls it. With dignity unmerited by us Invested, didst thou ask on what pretence The gonfalon was yielded to thy hands? Ray. Who knows it not? Your terror gave it me; Your terror takes it from me: to yourselves Terror is law supreme and deity. What attribute of king possess you not? Already ye possess the public hate, Their cruel artifice, their frantic vices, Their infamous contrivances. Ye tread The generous path trod by your ancestors: Proceed, oh valiant, in full sail proceed, While prosperous gales befriend you. Not wealth only, But life and honour ye will take away From those who give you umbrage: the sublime, And only right to your authority, From waste of blood arises. Greatly dare: And try to imitate the many tyrants By whom oppress'd Italia has been scourged ... Gu. My son, thou dost exceed all bounds. 'Tis true, That it is lawful for each man to speak His thoughts, while these have not thrown off the name Of citizens: but we ... Lo. Too late thou'rt cautious: Thy time hast thou ill chosen to restrain him. Fret not thyself; his words are thy begetting. Leave him to speak: on us depends to hear him. Ju. Audacious youth, minds ill-disposed already, What boots it to exasperate? 'Twould be The best for thee spontaneously to quit The gonfalon, which in contempt of us Thou wouldest keep in vain; thou seest it ... Ray. Shall I thus make myself deserving insults? Hear me: these arts successfully perchance May be adopted to ensure command, But not to ensure obedience. If I yield, I yield alone to force. Honour sometimes Is by submission gain'd, if we indeed Submit to nothing but to absolute, And dire necessity.âIt pleases me, As I have told you mine, to have heard your thoughts. Now new means to new violence I wait To see, and be they what they may, I swear That I will be of rising tyranny The victim, yes, but not the instrument. SCENE THE THIRD. Lorenzo, Julian, Guglielmo. Lo. Go; if thou carest for thy son, pursue him: To adapt his conduct better to the times Instruct him; and to this do thou thyself, By thy example, aid him. Equally With him indeed thou hatest us, yet thou Hast yielded to us, and dost yield. Engraft Thy own discretion on his headstrong will. I do not e'en pretend regard for you; I'll have ye feign'd; and nothing it annoys me. Haste, but obey; and yet obeying, tremble. Go thou, and tell to this thy mountebank, And pigmy Brutus, that his prototype, The real Brutus, fell in vain with Rome. Gu. I see my son's incautious. Yet I always Applied to him a father's wise reproofs; I preach endurance, but he learns it not. This is an art to which we've not been used: Failings of youth are worthy of excuse; He will amend.âBut thou, oh Julian, thou Who art with honours and prosperity Somewhat less drunken, mollify thy brother; And make him recollect, that if a Brutus Fail'd to regenerate Rome, yet many others Were sacrificed ere Rome and Brutus fell. SCENE THE FOURTH. Lorenzo, Julian. Ju. Heard'st thou how these address us? Lo. Yes, I hear. They're garrulous, and thence I fear them less. Ju. One may hatch plots ... Lo. But few will follow him. Ju. Raymond may be that one. Lo. That he may be That one, is what I hope. I fully know His courage, his resources, and his force: He may attempt, but he will ne'er succeed. What can I wish for more? I look to him, Hoping that he our mandate may transgress. Let him attempt it; we at once shall thwart him. Each hostile enterprize confirms our power, And to our just revenge at once prepares An ample field for action. In calm seas Progress is difficult; the earliest storm Will drive our vessel to the wish'd-for port. Ju. To wish for all at once, often at once Causes the loss of all. All danger's doubtful; Nor he who fills the throne should e'er permit Even the thought to cross his subjects' minds That he's assailable by other men. The opinion of the multitude, that holds Our breasts invulnerable, is in itself The very panoply that makes them so. Woe if we leave the passage to our hearts Once obvious to the point of traitrous swords! A day will come when it will penetrate, And find a passage to the very hilt. To-day, oh brother, yield thyself to me; No, our authority put not to proof, Or their revenge. Ah, yield thyself to me. Lo. To reason I am always wont to yield, And this I hope to prove to thee.âBut see, Bianca comes to us o'erwhelm'd with grief: How painful is it to my soul to hear Her lamentations! ... yet I'm forced to hear them. SCENE THE FIFTH. Bianca, Lorenzo, Julian. Bi. And is it true, oh brothers, 'tis your will To shew yourselves to me oppressive lords, Rather than brothers? Yet, if I to you Was ever dear, I am your sister still; And ye to Raymond gave me; ye who now Are thus the first to insult him. Lo. Art thou thus Become, Bianca, hostile to thy blood, That thou no more discernest equity? Hast thou with Raymond learn'd so much to hate us, That now our hearts are known to thee no longer? All that we wish to do is to defeat His malice by our measures. Gentle means, Far gentler than he merits, we adopt, To obviate further mischief: be convinced. Bi. Dear are ye to me, brothers; he to me Is also dear: I would do all for peace. But why, if he already was your foe, Give me to him in marriage? If ye gave Me to him, why insult him afterwards? Ju. We hoped that thou at least would'st be a check To his temerity ... Lo. But hoped in vain: For such is Raymond that 'twere easier far To exterminate than change him. Bi. But have you Ever towards him the manners used, that change A free, unconquer'd heart? If it grieves you Not to be loved by him, who, save yourselves, Prohibits his affection? Lo. Oh, my sister, How has the traitor utterly transfused His poison in thy heart! He hath estranged Thee, thee our sister, from all duteous thoughts; Guess then how banefully his hostile words Will operate elsewhere. Bi. I might behold With some complacency your sovereign power, If one man I beheld, one, only one, From your ferocious tyranny exempt; And if that one were Raymond; he to whom, By an indissoluble sacred tie, Ye have united me; with whom I live Inseparably join'd for many years, With whom participate, with whom endure A thousand injuries; to whom, alas! Pledges of faith and of eternal love (A wretched mother!) I have given already Too numerous and too dear a progeny;â Raymond, to whom I'm ready to yield all. Ju. To take from him his office, is to wrest The power of self-destruction from his hands, Rather than that of injury to ourselves. Indeed to be the first, it now becomes thee, To induce him to renounce it ... Bi. Ah! I see, I manifestly see, by different means, How to one end ye hasten. Of your views I was the earliest victim; I was not To real peace, but to delay'd revenge, A sacrifice. Oh well ye understood To assume at once the hearts and power of kings. 'Mid those resembling you, all natural ties Are treated with derision ... Wretched me! Why had I not discover'd this before? Why knew it not before I was a mother? But such I am; a mother and a wife ... Lo. I cannot blame thy grief; ... but longer now I cannot hear it.âBrother, let us go Whither our duty summons us.âAnd thou, Who deem'st us tyrants in thy heart, think not Of that which he has lost, but rather think Of that which, nothing meriting, he keeps. SCENE THE SIXTH. Bianca. Bi. Thus sufferance to retain, kings deem a gift.â With these my tears are vain: their hearts are mail'd In adamant. Let me return once more To unhappy Raymond: he at least beholds My tears without contempt. Who knows? Perchance My griefs may thus be lighten'd ... Why perchance? Can there be doubt of this? We should behold Each father promptly for his children's sake Resign his life, ere that a single prince Would to the tears of all his fellow-men, Much less then to a sister's tears, resign The paltry prize of one fantastic wish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Raymond, Salviati. Sal. Behold me here: this is the appointed day: I come; and bring with me whate'er I promised. Already to the borders of Etruria Warriors advance in arms: King Ferdinand Pays them; the Roman Sixtus blesses them; Ere they proceed, they wait to hear from us The signal of attack. Now say, hast thou All promised ammunition in these walls? Ray. My arm has long been ready for the blow; And I have store of others also ready; But whom to strike, or where, or how, or when, They know not; nor befits it that they know. But to the great achievement yet is wanting Its chiefest ornament: my aged father, He who alone could authorize the attempt, Is ignorant of it: to revengeful words His ears are closed; and thou wilt hear him speak Of sufferance yet. My thoughts are known to him; For ill I hide them; further he knows nothing: I deem'd it wisest to conceal from him This our confederacy till thou cam'st hither. Sal. What say'st thou? Nothing Guglielmo knows? And thinkest thou that, at the close of day, He should be ignorant of what he's doom'd To-morrow to accomplish? Ray. Thinkest thou That it were wise to risk so great a secret? That to a man, (though enterprizing once,) Infirm from years, 'twere wise to grant one night To after-thoughts? Beyond a few brief hours Audacity dwells not in empty veins; Prudence comes soon; irresolution thence, Procrastination and inconstancy, And the infecting others with alarm; And 'midst these doubts and fears the enterprize, The time for its completion, and the rage Ensuring its success, dissolve away, And guilty shame at last o'erwhelms the whole. Sal. But how, detests he not the dreadful yoke? And shares he not the general indignation? ... Ray. He hates it, but he fears more than he hates; And thence he vacillates eternally 'Twixt anger and dismay. Now he controuls His wholesome indignation, and he prays And waits for, and half hopes for, better times; And now, as by a fatal flash reveal'd, The truth at once on his bewilder'd mind Bursts forth; and all the heaviness he feels Of his unworthy chains, yet dares not burst them. He was indeed incensed beyond all bounds At the last outrage, which I would incur At all events. The useless gonfalon Let others gain, taken from me to-day. I have, with many and repeated insults, Myself compell'd the tyrants to resume The honour they bestow'd. Yet not the less For this have I indulged in loud complaints, Affecting an immeasurable grief For the invited injury.âOh see What times we live in, what abode is ours, When with hypocrisy we're forced to clothe E'en patriotic views!âBy schemes like these I have, at least in part, to my designs Silently moulded Guglielmo's heart. At length thou comest: thou shalt now divulge The king's assistance, the pontific wrath, The means concerted. Let us wait him here; For here we are accustomed to confer. Sal. Do not the tyrants oftentimes repair To these apartments? Ray. We are now secure From their approach: already has this place Witness'd their public and obnoxious toils. The remnant of the day, which we consume, We, the scorn'd multitude, in useless tears, They spend in revels and in sensual joys. Hence I invited thee to meet me here; And hence my father also summon'd. He, At first, will be amazed at seeing thee: In a short time I will reveal to him The indignation and the hardihood, And the immutable and stern resolve Of giving death, or dying, which we feel. Mine be the task to inflame him. But, meanwhile, Let him at once learn this confederacy Both can be form'd, and is already form'd. Sal. Thou dost admonish wisely: more and more I deem thee, as I listen to thy words, A worthy instrument of liberty. As these are born oppressors, so art thou Defender of thy country. To induce Thy father to concur in our designs, The sanction of the pope will much avail. Those early principles on aged hearts Have mighty influence, which e'en with our milk We once imbibed. Rome, evermore believed Implicitly by our forefathers, named Each enterprize, injurious to herself, Impious; and those, whatever they might be, Holy, that aided her ambitious views. If we are wise, this ancient prejudice May now avail us much: since at this time, Not as he's wont to be, the successor Of Peter is the enemy of tyrants, At this time, more than all allies beside, That successor of Peter may befriend us. Ray. It grieves me, I to thee alone confess it, It grieves me not a little, thus to make Vile means subservient to a generous end. To raise as watchword in the cause of freedom, The name of Rome, the abode of guilty slaves: Here are the times, and not myself, in fault! And further am I grieved, that I'm constrain'd To make pretext of individual wrongs In this most righteous cause. The multitude Will think that I'm inflamed by low revenge And selfish passions; and perchance believe That I am envious of the tyrant's power.â Oh heaven, thou knowest ... Sal. Let not thoughts like these Divert thee from thy purpose: speedily The foolish vulgar will be undeceived By our performances. Ray. The time to come Fills me with mournful and foreboding thoughts. Their necks they have accustomed to the yoke; Their natural rights forgotten; they know not That they're in chains, much less desire to burst them. Slavery, the natures who resist it not, Transforms, embrutes; and rather needs their force To give them freedom than to clench their fetters. Sal. Hence will the enterprize be more exalted, And worthier of thyself. In Greece or Rome 'Twas meritorious, though not difficult, To endow free souls with freedom. But to rouse Dead and degraded slaves to life at once And liberty, ah this indeed requires Sterner devotion. Ray. It is true: yet fame Awaits the mere attempt. Ah, were I sure As of my own arm, and of my own heart, Of those of my compatriots! But by slaves The tyrant, not the tyranny, is hated. SCENE THE SECOND. Guglielmo, Salviati, Raymond. Gu. Thou, Salviati, here? I thought thou wert Pursuing honours on the Tyber's banks. Sal. A mightier object to my natal soil Restores me. Gu. Lucklessly dost thou review A soil which it were better to forget. To us what foolish purpose guides thee safe, Far from the tyrants didst thou dwell, and thou Returnest to thy prison. To the man Doom'd to behold his native land enslaved By cruel and by arbitrary power, What unfrequented and what distant spot (However savage and inhospitable,) Can be unwelcome? Let my son to thee Be an example, if we ought to look From these our MedicÃ¦an lords for aught But outrages and scorn. In vain, in vain Rome with the sacred ministry invests thee; Their supreme will alone is here held sacred. Ray. Father, and know'st thou whether he comes here Arm'd with endurance or a shield less vile? Sal. Of bitter and retributory wrath I come the austere minister: I come Of plenary, inflexible revenge, Though late, the certain messenger. I hope To arouse ye all from the vile lethargy In which ye all lie buried, abject slaves, Now that with me and with my rage I bring The holy rage of Sixtus, sovereign pontiff. Gu. Arms wholly useless: rage we do not want; We want support; endurance or support Must be our choice or chance. Sal. Support we bring, And more effectual than was ever proffer'd. I bring not words alone. Hear; for to me, In brief yet powerful language, it belongs The business to divulge. There are, by whom I am commission'd to recall to thee, Provided thou canst yet remember them, The ancient times, and thy original pride. If not, the painful duty then is mine The degradation of thyself and others To bring before thine eyes. If in thy veins There yet is blood left to revolt at this, Assistance is not far from us. Already The Roman banners in the Etrurian ports Wave to the wind; and far more firm support The standard of King Ferdinand affords, Follow'd by thousand swords in firm array, Impatient for the fight, at one slight nod Of thine for any enterprize prepared. In thy arbitrement is placed the life Of the oppressors; thine and thy son's honour; The freedom of us all. That which thy sword May yet obtain, that which thou yet may'st lose From cowardice, thy doubts, thy hopes, thy fears, Our loss and our disgrace maturely weigh, And finally resolve. Gu. What do I hear? To thee can I yield credence? Who obtain'd So much for our advantage? Hitherto Profuse alone in empty promises Sixtus and Ferdinand were tardy friends. Who now impels them, who? ... Ray. Dost thou ask that? Hast thou so soon forgotten then that I Repair'd to Naples and the Tyber's banks? That there twelve months I tarried? To what clime Can I transport myself, and not inspire, Where'er I go, resentment and abhorrence? Among what people can I drag my days, Into whose bosoms I shall not transfuse All, all my indignation, and at once Excite in them compassion for myself And for my friends? Who now remains Deaf to my lamentations?âFor our shame Thou art alone so, father; where thou oughtest, More than all others, to abhor the yoke, And feel its weight: thou, whom I call my father, Art equally with me the tyrants' foe; And art by them, e'en more than I am, scorn'd. Thou, once the best among good citizens, For thy too facile criminal endurance Art now among the guilty ones the worst. Ah, make, with thy infirm refusal, make Our fetters and thy infamy eternal! All now perceive that we are fit to serve, But not to live: yes, wait, wait on for time, Till time is ours no more: those hoary locks For fresh disgraces keep; and palliate With false compassion for thy son, which he With all his heart abhors and disavows, Thy ignominious cowardice. Gu. My son, For such indeed thou art, no less than thou, Fervid with youth and generous vehemence, I once thus thunder'd; but that time is past; E'en now I am not vile, nor deem'st thou so Who thus aspersest me; but I have ceased To act by chance. Ray. Thou art resign'd to live Each day by chance, and wilt not act by chance? What art thou? What are we? Would not the hope, The most precarious, of revenge, now be A state more certain than the doubtful one, The apprehensive one, in which we're doom'd, Trembling, to live? Gu. Thou know'st that for myself I tremble not. Ray. Then would'st thou say for me, I absolve thee from all paternal care On my account. We both are citizens, And nothing else to-day; and there remains Far more for me than for thyself to lose. To the meridian of my days have I Scarcely attain'd; and thou towards night declinest. Children thou hast; like thee I am a father; I have an offspring but too numerous, And of that helpless age that they are fit Only to wake compassion in my heart.â Different, far different, are my ties from thine. I see a lovely consort, of myself The better part, eternally in tears Beside me pining: when they see her weep, My children flock around, and ask her why; And they too weep with her. Their sorrows rend My heart; and I'm constrain'd to weep by stealth. But soon the sad remembrance disenchants Each soft affection of my wither'd heart, That 'tis not fitting for a slave to love Objects not his. My consort is not mine, My children are not mine, while I permit Him, whosoe'er he be, that is a tyrant, In this place to inhale the vital air. I have no tie now left in all the world Except the stern inexorable oath, Tyrants and tyranny to extirpate. Gu. Would'st thou slay two of them: to willing slaves Will tyrants e'er be wanting? Ray. To the free Will swords be wanting? Let them rise by thousands, By thousands they shall fall, or I will fall. Gu. I am subdued by thy decisive will. I, not unworthy of a son like thee, Would to thy noble rage commit myself, If of our arms, and not of foreign powers, Thou would'st avail thyself. I see not, no, For our sakes, Rome and Ferdinand in arms; But for the injury of the Medici. We place them in these walls ourselves, but who At will can chace them afterwards from thence? The mercenary soldiers of a king Seem not to me the harbingers of freedom. Sal. I thus reply to thee. The faith of Rome, The faith of Ferdinand I warrant not: It is the accustomed plan of those who reign Alternately to give it or resume it. In the suspicion common to them both, Their mutual envy, and in what is call'd State policy, do thou to-day confide. Both fain would domineer o'er us; but one Prevents the other. Pity for our state Their heart conceives not; nor have I alleged it: But long experience, to our shame, persuades them That popular and fluctuating rule, The turbulence of faction, render us Slow to resolve, irresolute in act. Each of them fears that, on the Tuscan ruins, A single Tuscan chieftain should arise, Who may suffice to annihilate the one, If with the other leagued. Behold at once The royal knot untwisted: private ends Prompt both alliances. If otherwise, Think'st thou that I should ever dare to urge Reliance on the friendship of a king? Ray. And were it otherwise, dost thou believe That I should inconsiderately relax The reins, that I, with persevering hand, O'er the reboundings of my struggling will, Have held so many years? I utter'd not By accident inflammatory words To thee; by accident thou didst not hear me Exasperate with pungent virulence The tyrant's rage against me. Long I spake not, While silence might assist me; but the proud, Imprudent tauntings that have madden'd them To injure me, by prudence were inspired. To my vile fellow-slaves I had in vain Our general wrongs adduced; for private ones Alone establish in corrupted minds Right to retaliation. I could find Abettors of my vengeance, if alone I of myself discoursed; but not one man Could I e'er find discoursing of my country. Hence (ah opprobrious and cruel silence, But indispensable!) I never dared To name my country, never. But to thee, Who art not of the common herd of men, Can I refrain from naming her? Ah no!â The object of our enterprize consists In slaying the two tyrants: but 'twill be Of far more difficult accomplishment To fashion after consequences well; To give to inanition life once more; To re-create our prostrate commonwealth, To make it once more strong, and capable Of liberty; to make its pulses beat, Now languishing, with vigorous, virtuous health. Now, say'st thou not that we're confederate To a most holy purpose? I alone Am leader of this lofty brotherhood; He is but one, as thou may'st also be, Of its component parts. We have, thou seest, Great instruments; and courage greater still: Sublime the end, and worthy of ourselves. Thou, father, from a project great as this, Wilt thou shrink back dishearten'd? Thy consent Grant me, oh grant me; nothing else is wanting. The swords unscabbarded are raised already: Give, give the signal only, and thou seest them In their devoted bosoms plunged at once, And make an ample space for liberty. Gu. Thou hast a hero's mind.âA noble shame, Astonishment, resentment, hope, and rage, All hast thou raised in me. Sense of old age, Courage of manhood, and the fire of youth, What hast thou not? My guide and my commander, My deity art thou.âIt shall be thine Alone, the honour of this enterprize; With thee its dangers I will only share! Thou say'st, that nought is wanting but my name To accomplish it. Henceforward to thy will That name, and all its influence, I yield: Dispose, elect, and whomsoe'er thou wilt Rescind from our confederates. Keep alone A weapon for thy father: thou shalt teach me What post I should fill up, what blow inflict, The whole shall teach me, when the whole is ready: In thee and thy judicious rage I trust. Ray. But ... more than thou may'st think ... that time draws near. Thou wilt not be inconstant? Gu. I am thy father: Dost thou expect to change? Ray. Then whet thy blade, For at the dawn of day ... But who approaches? Bianca! ... Oh my friend, let us avoid her. The last directions to this mighty work Haste we to give. To thee I shall return, Father, ere long, and then thou shalt know all. SCENE THE THIRD. Guglielmo, Bianca. Bi. I seek for Raymond, and he flies from me. Oh tell me wherefore, and with whom he flies!â What do I see? Thou seem'st bereft of reason! What troublous thoughts estrange thee from thyself? Ah, speak: does any danger threaten us? ... O'er whom does it impend? ... Gu. If agony Heavily sits upon my pallid face, Why should'st thou be surprised at this? I fear, And cannot hide my fears; and who fears not? If thou look round, a pallidness like mine On every face is painted. Bi. But for fear What fresh occasion? ... Gu. 'Tis not fresh, oh daughter. Bi. But I have always seen thee hitherto Immoveable: thou fearest now, and say'st it. And Raymond, who like an impetuous storm Of violent discordant impulses Seem'd hitherto to me, I now behold Assume the semblance of a tranquil man. Not long ago, words breathing nought but peace He spake to me: and he, of all suspense The instinctive enemy, professes now To expect alleviation from delay: With one unknown he flies from me; and thou Stay'st agitated here. ... Ah yes, there is Too certainly a secret; ... and thou hid'st it, From me thou hidest it? My sire, my spouse, Vie in deluding me. May heaven permit ... Gu. Check these suspicions, check these tears: in vain Should I, alarm'd, exhort thee not to fear. Fear thou, but fear not us.âWell said my son, That time alone can bring us palliatives. Go to thy children: thou canst not perform A task more grateful to us than to guard them, To love them well, and nourish them to virtueâ Useful advice, if thou from me regard it, 'Twill be to thee, that thou should'st persevere, Where words avail not, in profoundest silence ... Thus, oh Bianca, thou wilt surely win All our affections; and at once escape The persecution of thy cruel brothers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Julian, and an armed Follower. Ju. Ho; here bring Guglielmo instantly. SCENE THE SECOND. Julian. Ju. Does Salviati then return to Florence? Why should he stir from Rome? How dares he plant His footsteps in these thresholds? Does he thus Despise our hatred, and our power, and us?â But yet, if he returns, his hardihood Springs certainly from force, ... from borrow'd force.â Yes, now 'tis indispensable to use All stratagems to frustrate those results, Which, having once befall'n, we should in vain For reparation strive. Be Guglielmo First summon'd to our presence; haply he, Exhausted by the infirmities of age, May by the bait of flattery be surprized To indiscreet confession. To these traitors Since Salviati now has join'd himself, The messenger of papal subtlety, All circumspective vigilance is needful; And with profuse professions we must seek A reinforcement of preventive measures, And time to adapt them to the exigence. SCENE THE THIRD. Guglielmo, Julian. Ju. Oh, Guglielmo, thou who dost possess, More than all other men, the precious fruit Of a long life, and a long life well spent, Experience and wisdom; who dost know, Dost understand, and canst discriminate The modern and the antiquated rights Of this our country; listen to my words. Already, by the power which now is mine, I am not blinded, nor have I consign'd To iniquitous forgetfulness the name Of citizen; I know full well how brief, And how unstable are the gifts of fortune. I know ... Gu. What thou may'st be who knows? 'Tis true, Thou dost appear more lenient than thy brother; But so corrupted is the vulgar mind, That though it fears thee less, it does not thence Detest thee less than he. Perchance a tyrant, Who forces to obey a race enslaved, Is more acceptable than one who stoops To dupe them to obedience. Ju. I confess Lorenzo oft is culpably incautious; Nor is thy Raymond so invincible As he believes himself. Let us confer, Soften'd by more conciliatory thoughts.â Thou knowest that the citizens, inform'd And apprehensive of the ancient licence, Committed to our trust the superflux Of liberty; from whence the nobler parts Have since remain'd eternally untouch'd ... Gu. How hast thou a plain argument perplex'd With subtle phrases destitute of sense! There is a simple name for servitude. Call those who yield to despots slaves at once. Ju. And to thy freedom give the name of licence. I came not for these flimsy arguments. Gu. 'Tis true, that folly only fights in words. Ju. Then listen to me ere I illustrate This truth with deeds. A fervid virulence Consumes thy Raymond's heart: with youth and power Lorenzo also feels life's pulse beat high. To thee, thy son, and to thy entire race, May ruin thence result: but also thence Our ruin may result by treacherous means. I speak not of Lorenzo as a brother; Nor speak thou as a father of thy son. We're citizens, and thou the best. Now say, Should we not strenuously exert ourselves To hinder tumults, bloodshed, and disgrace? And thou the more so now, as thou art placed In most alarming danger? Thou who dar'st Call servitude, th'observance of the laws, Perceivest, that amid new broils, to you The load will rather be increased than lessen'd. Be thou at once a citizen and father: Make thy son somewhat yield: if he alone Confess that he is less than we, with this Lorenzo will be pacified. It is Allotted to thee with one word of thine To frustrate each pernicious consequence. Gu. Who could make Raymond yield? And should I do it, E'en if I could? Ju. At once confess to me: If thou wert sovereign here, and thou didst see Thy power contemn'd by us, as ours is now By him, what punishment wouldst thou inflict? Gu. I should esteem that I in ruling here So much more grievously insulted others, That of each insult offered to myself I should take no account. Of liberty, What less part can be left to those who lose it Than to lament its loss? Each man should speak, Were I in your place, as his judgment dictates; But act alone conformable to mine. Silent, alone are formidable, foes: And scatter'd poison injures not its object. Frankly I speak to thee: I do not deem My son for lofty enterprises fit: Ah, were he so! Thou would'st not hear me thus Address thee abjectly; nor hadst thou seen Me tremble and obey.â'Gainst foes like us, Contempt, when managed with dexterity, ('Tis but too true) is adequate defence. Behold, it seems to me, that, though no tyrant, I can prescribe to thee, with decent skill, The laws of tyranny, the stratagems, The conduct, and the principles sublime. Ju. What would'st thou say to me? And know I not, As well as thou dost know, this son of thine? Gu. And dost thou fear him? Ju. Fear'd, I fear again.â To simulate, or to dissimulate, Were idle now. Let us for once renounce In words, what always we renounce in deeds, Maxims fallacious as they're plausible: Not from our country, not from laws, or freedom, But from self-love, and self-utility, And apprehensions of contingent loss, Let each of us, with more sincerity, And with more wisdom, take his rule of conduct. Lorenzo all the qualities possesses, By which a new state is increased and sway'd, Except forbearance and timidity: Nature hath form'd me in another mould; And that which is deficient in himself In me is perhaps excessive: but confess, Art thou not e'en more timorous than I? Do not I see the spirit of mistrust, And apprehension, in thy smallest actions? I know, no base of some eternal rock Is in the restless main more firmly placed, Than Raymond and Lorenzo stand unmoved In their resolves: in nature they are equal, Yet not in power: but equal is our fear. As with my brother I exert myself, Do thou exert thyself with this thy son. Perhaps we may yet see other times. Few years Hast thou to live; yet these thou would'st desire, Though burthensome and comfortless, to spend: Thou hast supported such ... Would'st thou preserve them? Gu. The terror of a tyrant, and a father, No one would place in counteracting scales Save he who is a tyrant and a father. I feel my own alarm; thine, thou alone Canst feel and estimate. Paternal fear, Which is the most excusable, to-day Surmounts the other. Far as I avail I will exert myself, that Raymond chuse Spontaneous exile; and 'twere best he did so; For not for vengeance, but for fresh injustice, In these abhorred walls will he remain. SCENE THE FOURTH. Lorenzo, Julian, Guglielmo. Lo. Julian, what dost thou? Dost thou spend in words The time that others spend in deeds? ... Ju. At last This old man yields to my persuasive speech. Dost spurn at peace before I've made it sure? Lo. Who talks of peace? Lo, Salviati comes, The source of all disturbance, the contriver Of every guilty, circumventive plot. Ju. I know it; but meanwhile ... Lo. And dost thou know, That from the south he brings arm'd warriors here? In truth no martial race: to whom we ought To shew ourselves, and only shew ourselves. At the first lightening of our shields, at once Their fenny cloud will be dispersed. Indeed, What courage founded not in others fears, Was e'er display'd by Rome? Gu. And what, my lord? Can one defenceless citizen's return From Tyber's banks excite suspicion in thee? And to your detriment would Rome now arm, Who so infrequently and clumsily Combats, and only in her own defence? Lo. More than one hero hath been made to tremble Before the pope's perfidious myrmidons. 'Mid roses, and 'mid lilies, they conceal Daggers and poison. It is true, their arms Would, if foreseen, be always impotent.â Ye satellites of Rome, I leave you here: Plot ye till I return. My brother, come; Let us depart. We will afterwards With these resume our conference: but first Let those pale quivering banners that display The surreptitious keys, seized or dispersed, Or burn'd, or trampled in the squalid filth, Fall by our hands. We should first somewhat shake The putrid aged trunk on which fraud leans; Since it belongs to ages more remote To eradicate it wholly.âLet us go.â With joys my heart leaps up in thrusting thee Against an open enemy, oh sword! And only I regret, if thou disdain To smite the back of hostile fugitives, That thou must here return fasting from blood. SCENE THE FIFTH. Guglielmo. Gu. He has a lofty soul; a soul too great For tyranny. He doubtlessly will reign, Except he fall a victim to our swords. But reign, reign at thy pleasure; thou shalt be Quickly resembling thy perfidious brother; Crafty, flagitious, apprehensive, cruel; In short, what ought to be, and is, who reigns. Now light already thickens, and my son Comes not to me; nor Salviati comes. But of the Roman troops not yet in march How could Lorenzo hear? This enterprise Which we project is hard to execute; And doubtful its success. But yet the rage, The vengeance, temper'd with sagacity, Of Raymond, reassure me.âLet me seek him ... SCENE THE SIXTH. Raymond, Salviati, Guglielmo. Gu. Oh! tell me in what posture are our hopes? Ray. Almost completed. Sal. Heaven, at length, smiles on us: My hopes are more than realized. Gu. Far more Than I was heretofore, ye find me ready, And for an ample vengeance. Insolence! Here Julian took upon himself erewhile To covenant with me for our disgrace; And afterwards Lorenzo joined his brother, Threat'ning and arrogant. I spake to him Now doubtful words, indignant now, now feign'd; For the most part in servile tones disguised, To tyrants so acceptable: they deem No crime so dire as that of fearlessness. I would not rouse suspicion in their souls; They think me full of fearâBut tell me how The secret of the foreign armament Hath thus in part transpired? Lorenzo seems, 'Tis true, to view it with consummate scorn, And to account it th'ineffectual fruit Of home-bred intrigues foster'd by ourselves. Such confidence assists us; and though Julian Hath intimated that he apprehends Domestic discontents, he fancies not The vengeance so inevitably near, Or so alarming as it is. Ah say, Is our success then certain? What assailant, What arms, what means, where, when? ... Ray. Hear thou the whole. Meanwhile with wonder be not stupified At what Lorenzo knows. We artfully, Their forces to divert, at first proclaim'd The foe's approach. But in the vulgar ear The arms of Rome exclusively resound. âThe holy Sixtus sends a little aid âTo rescue from their recent servitude âThe oppress'd Tuscan.ââThe report behold, In consequence of which I hoped, the tyrants A scanty, but an open force expecting, Would turn towards this alone their anxious thoughts; And rightly I conjectured. To the camp, At dawn of day, Lorenzo hastes to go; But too inevitably will arise That dawn for him, destined to be his last. Both shall be slain to-morrow. I have chosen A few, but stubborn both in hand and heart, For the great enterprise. Anselmo, Albert, Napoleon, and Bandini, and thy son. Rinato vile, dishonouring our race, Refused to be one of this noble band. Gu. Coward! and should he now betray us? ... Ray. Oh, Could he imagine that! but, free from vice, He has no virtue: speak of him no more.â Ready for every signal, Anselm' keeps His armed men; but wherefore they know not: We shall commence th'attack at the same time That he shall occupy the greater forum, The palace; and the many avenues Thitherward tending; thence the populace Invite to freedom: we meanwhile shall join them ... Gu. But in one place t'inflict on them one death Do you expect? Woe, if an interval, E'en of one moment, 'twixt the blows elapse! Ray. Ere from these walls they issue to the camp, At dawn of day, both to the church will go T'implore Heaven's aid to their tyrannic arms: There shall they both be slain. Gu. What do I hear? In the house of God? Sal. Yes, in the house of God. What victim can we offer to the skies More welcome than an immolated tyrant? Hath he not set th'example to defy Men, laws, and nature, and high Heaven itself? Gu. Thou speakest truly; yet with human blood To desecrate the altars ... Sal. Human blood, The blood of tyrants? They on human blood Who feed? And for such monsters shall there be A sacred refuge? Turpitude be safe There, where eternal justice has its throne? Were they both wreathed around their Maker's image, For this I would not sheathe my lifted sword. Gu. The people, who behold with other eyes Actions like these, with thundering voice will call us Irreverent, sacrilegious homicides. This universal prejudice alone Our enterprise may thwart, or wrest from us All its advantages ... Ray. On th'other hand This interval alone can serve our purpose: There is no superfluity of time: To-morrow they are sacrificed, or never. That which is needful is t'ensure the blows; Nor any place adapted to ensure them Is there like this.âConsiderest thou the people? More than with anger, with astonishment All innovation they are apt to view. We will give orders, that, at the same moment In which we draw our swords, the sacred roof Shall echo with the anathemas of Rome. Gu. 'Tis true, the name of Rome may do much here. But which of us the honour shall obtain Of the first blow? What post shall I fill up? Wrath, impulse, courage, here alone suffice not. Rather a will extravagantly warm May injure here.âA cold ferocious valour, A prompt and steady hand, a face unmoved, A heart whose element is human blood, A mute inflexibility of lip, Men should have these who are tyrannicides. A motion, nod, or look inopportune, Nay, e'en a thought, may break the fatal charm, The destined victim's confidence may thwart, Time for the deed, the perpetrator's courage. Ray. We have ourselves arranged the first attack: The first blow shall be mine: to quench their thirst Then the less resolute shall venture forth, Soon as the dastard tyrants on the earth, Weltering in blood, praying for life, shall fall. Father, the signal heard, if thou repair Where stands Anselmo, thou wilt aid us much, Far more than in the temple; from whose shelter, Soon as the blow is hurl'd, we shall rush forth. I grieve that I alone cannot at once Both of them murder.âOh! what saidst thou, father? A prompt and steady hand? This very steel Shall sooner fail than my right-hand and heart. Gu. Why emulating thee can I not strike? 'Tis true, too true, alas! that, weak with age, My tremulous limbs to my untrembling heart May give the lie. Thou art a light from Heaven To dissipate my doubts: thou hast thought well: For all hast well provided; and in vain I speak. It pleases me that the first blows Ye have awarded to yourselves alone. How much I envy you! I only fear'd Thou would'st refuse, with victims so impure, To stain thy sacerdotal hand ... Sal. How ill Thou knowest me! Behold my dagger; see it; 'Tis no less sacred than the hand that grasps it: The holy Sixtus having bless'd it first, To me consign'd it. Interchangeably The same hand grasp'd the crosier and the sword: T'extinguish tyrants, and their impious slaves, The mighty God of battle arm'd himself, The right-hand never fallible, and dire, Of his anointed priests. These arms I grasp, These consecrated, homicidal arms, Shall hang one day an offering on these altars. A fury more than human hath inflamed me: And though I bring an arm unused to blood, That heaven-descended fury, to the heart Which I have chosen to pierce, shall guide my hand. Gu. And hast thou chosen then? ... Sal. Lorenzo. Gu. Ah! The most ferocious? Ray. Though I had preferr'd To slay the strongest, yet have I agreed In this t'indulge him. Furthermore, I thought That most assuredly the abject Julian Would fence his cowardice in hidden mail; Whence, as the enterprise most difficult, Him I accepted. Thou shalt have Lorenzo; The guilty Julian is my destined prey: E'en now I grasp him: now within that breast, Receptacle of treachery and fraud, The sword I plunge up to the very hilt. The signal to unsheathe, and to assault, Will be the sacred moment, when, by hymns Chaunted in whispers, from his high abode The son of God mysteriously drawn down, Enters the consecrated element.â Now thou know'st all: as soon as thou shalt hear The tolling of the saintly bell, rush forth; And then remember, that our enterprise Has been defeated, or is perfected. Gu. I will do all.âLet us now separate:â Oh Night, thou last of slavery or life, Hasten thy flagging and invidious course!â Do thou meanwhile inflexibly, oh son, Distrust Bianca: love doth often make A woman's heart consummate in discernment. And thou, oh Salviati, recollect, That if thy first blow should be found abortive, Lorenzo is not one to give thee time, Or opportunity, to aim a second.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Raymond, Bianca. Ray. What would'st thou now? retire to thy apartments: Leave me; I shall return here instantly. Bi. And may I not go with thee? Ray. No. Bi. Ah, why? ... Ray. Thou canst not. Bi. Dost thou disregard me thus? Oh dear departed days, where are ye gone? Then from thy side thou didst not banish me; Nor didst thou ever move but I moved with thee, Blessing thy never solitary steps! Wherefore do I displease thee? and in what Have I offended thee? Thou fliest from me; And, what is worse, thou drivest me from thy presence. Ah, then, the sound of this my once-loved voice, No longer reaches, much less penetrates, Thy alienated heart! I will pursue thee, If only at a distance ... Ray. But what fear'st thou? Or what dost thou suspect? ... Bi. Thou know'st. Ray. I know That thou lov'st me, that thee I also love; Love thee far more than thou canst comprehend. My lips divulge it not; but every gesture, My looks, my countenance, my heart declare it. Now, if I chase thee from me, or avoid thee, I do it, since I wish to afflict thee less With my calamities; ... what solace, say, Canst thou give me? Bi. Cannot I weep with thee? Ray. To see thee waste away thy life in tears, In useless tears, redoubles my affliction. I fly from all society thou seest; And to myself am burthensome. Bi. I see Far more than this; too certainly I see That thou mistrustest me. Ray. I tell thee not All my misfortunes? ... Bi. Thy misfortunes, yes; But not their remedies. With some great scheme Thy heart is labouring: and thou deemest not That thou should'st tell it me? Conceal it then. I ask of thee alone to follow thee; And thou refusest it? I may, perchance, A little help, but never injure thee. Ray. What say'st thou? ... Nothing in my heart I hide ... Except my rage, as useless as 'tis ancient. Bi. But yet this long uninterrupted night, Which scarcely yet the rising dawn disperses, How different, ah, how very different, Was it to thee from all preceding nights! Not one brief moment did calm sleep descend Upon thy weary eyes. Thou closed'st them To deceive me the better; but the thick, And frequent pantings of thy breast; thy sighs Suppress'd by force; thy face alternately Inflamed with fire, or bathed in hues of death; ... All I observed, yes, all; for love watch'd with me: I'm not deceived: in vain thou would'st conceal ... Ray. And vainly dost thou rave.âAbove my head, 'Tis true, that genial and profound repose Spread not its wings; but this oft happens to me. And who the blessedness of sleep enjoys Where tyrants dwell? Eternally on high, Above the head of slaves, a naked sword Hangs by a slender thread. Save idiots, here No other men repose. Bi. What wilt thou say Of thy so sudden starting from thy pillow? Is this thy wonted hour? The shades of night Were undiminish'd yet, when thou already Hadst leap'd abruptly from thy bed, like one Whom unaccustom'd care consumes. Towards me Did not I see thee afterwards direct, Sighing, thy humid eyes? and scarcely risen, Thy children one by one embrace? embrace! Nay, rather to thy breast a thousand times Glue them, devouring them with eager kisses; Convulsed with agony, did not I see thee, With copious torrent of paternal tears, Their little breasts and faces inundate? Thou erewhile so ferocious? Thou, a man Whose eyes are never visited by tears? Shall I see these things, and not apprehend That something vast and ominous lies hid In the recesses of thy labouring heart? Ray. ... I wept? Bi. And thou deniest it? Ray. I wept? ... Bi. With undropt tears thine eyes are humid still. If in this breast thou shedd'st them not, ah where? ... Ray. Feel, feel, these eyes are dry; ... no tears are there ... And if erewhile I wept ... I wept the fate Of the poor children of an outraged father. Must I incessantly not weep their birth, And their existence? Wretched little ones! What fate in this long death, which we call life, Awaits you! To increase your infamy, Ye are at once the tyrants' slaves and nephews ... I ne'er embrace you but I weep for this ... These pledges of our love, let them be dear To thee, oh consort; since I, with a love, Love them too different from thy love; and now Too different from these corrupted times. Yet, notwithstanding, weep their destiny; ... And, to their father, take especial heed They be not like, if it can comfort thee Rather to bring them up to servitude, Than to the practice or the love of virtue. Bi. Oh Heaven! ... what words! ... my sons! ... alas! ... In danger? Ray. If peril rises, I confide them to thee. Do thou withdraw them from the tyrants' rage Should it be ever needful. Bi. Woe is me! Now I perceive, I understand, and now Am certain. Art thou come, oh fatal day? Now is the mighty enterprise mature: Thou wouldest change the state. Ray. ... And if I would, Have I sufficient strength for such a deed? I would perchance accomplish it; but oh, These are the visions of a maniac ... Bi. Ah! ill thou feignest: those beloved lips Are not accustom'd to deceive thy consort. That thou dost undertake a mighty task My terror tells me; and those various, Tremendous workings of thy countenance, That in a crowd in quick succession throng, Despairing agony, compassion, rage, Hatred, revenge, and love. Ah, by those children, Which thou, spite of thyself, dost so much love; Not by myself, oh no! for I am nothing; And by thy eldest child, our growing hope, Our mutual precious hope, I do conjure thee, At least, in part, reveal to me thy thoughts! Only convince me thou'rt exempt from danger, And I am pacified: if 'tis not so, Suffer me at thy side. Ah! how ought I To save thy children, if I do not know What peril threatens them? I fall, I fall, Prostrate before thee: I will never rise Till thou dost speak. If thou mistrustest me, Slay me at once; if, on the other hand, Thou dost confide in me, why art thou silent? I am thy wife, and nothing else: ah speak. Ray. ... Lady, ... oh rise! Thy terror represents Dangers to thy affrighted phantasy, At present far removed. Arise, return; Continue with thy children: I to them Will also come ere long: leave me. Bi. Ah no! ... Ray. Leave me; 'tis my command. Bi. Abandon thee? Ah! rather kill me: by no other means Shall this fond grasp be loosen'd ... Ray. Cease. Bi. Oh Heaven! Ray. Desist; or I ... Bi. I will pursue thy steps. Ray. Ah wretched me! Behold my father here! Behold my father. SCENE THE SECOND. Guglielmo, Raymond, Bianca. Gu. What dost thou do here? There are who now expect thee at the temple; And meanwhile idle here? ... Ray. Heard'st thou? I go; What dost thou fear? Ah stay; detain her, father: I fly ... and soon return.âTo thee, Bianca, I recommend my children, if thou lovest me. SCENE THE THIRD. Guglielmo, Bianca. Bi. What words! Ah wretched me! to death he flies! And thou forbiddest me to follow him! Cruel ... Gu. Stay, stay; be pacified; ere long He will return. Bi. Cruel! dost thou thus feel Compassion for thy son? Thou leavest him Alone to encounter death, and thou'rt a father! If thus thou canst, abandon him; but ah! Stop not my steps: loose me, I will go to him ... Gu. Thy going now would be mistimed and late. Bi. Late! Ah! it is then true that he attempts ... Ah! tell me ... Speak, or let me go ... Where flies he? ... To some most dangerous enterprize I know; But ought I not to hear of what belongs To such a precious portion of myself? Do you indeed more than myself remember The blood from which I spring? Ah, speak! I am Now fashion'd of your blood: I do not hate My brothers, no; but I love only Raymond. I love him much as human heart can love; And now I fear for him, lest, ere he take The state from them, they take from him his life. Gu. If this be what thou fear'st, and since thou seem'st To know so much already, be assured Less dubious is his life than that of others. Bi. Oh heaven! are then my brothers' lives in danger? Gu. Tyrants are never safe. Bi. What do I hear? Alas! ... Gu. Think'st thou that one can wrest the state From those possessing it, and not their lives? Bi. My consort ... then ... seeks ... to betray ... my blood? ... Gu. Yes, it behoves us treacherously to spill Their blood, ere ours they treacherously quaff: And to the hard extremity by force They have compell'd us. Instantly from thee Thy husband and thy children had been taken; Ah, thence 'twas indispensable for us To anticipate their cruel purposes. Myself, thou seest, to aid the enterprise Have girt the sword, so many years disused, To my enfeebled side. Bi. Ferocious souls! Dissembling hearts! I could not have believed ... Gu. Daughter, what wouldest thou? Necessity To this compels us. For us to retract 'Tis now too late. Put up what vows to heaven Thou likest best: meanwhile escape from hence Is not allowed to thee: thou'rt guarded now By many armed warriors.âIf thou art, As thou should'st be more than aught else, a mother, Return to thy poor children, ah return ... But now, methinks, I hear the sacred toll Of the lugubrious bell ... I'm not mistaken. Oh son! ... I fly to liberty or death! SCENE THE FOURTH. Bianca, armed Soldiers. Bi. Hear me ... Oh how he flies! and I am forced To tarry here! In pity let me go. This is the only breast that, interposed, Can staunch that sea of blood ... Are your hard hearts, Barbarians, inaccessible to pity?â Impious, flagitious, execrable marriage! I ought to have foreseen that blood alone Could finish such immeasurable hate. Now I perceive why Raymond could not speak: In truth thou diddest well to hide from me Such unimaginable wickedness: I thought thee capable of high revenge, But never of an abject treason, never ... What tumult do I hear? Oh heaven! ... What shrieks! Methinks the earth shakes! ... Oh! with what a loud And clamorous dissonance the air rebounds! ... The name of liberty, of liberty, I hear distinctly ... The soldiers retire. Ah! perhaps already My brothers are no more ... Who do I see? Oh heavens! Raymond! SCENE THE FIFTH. Raymond, Bianca. Bi. Wretch! what hast thou done? Speak. Return'st thou, perfidious spouse! to me Thy guilty dagger reeking with my blood? Who would have ever thought thou wert a traitor! What do I see? Alas! from thy own side The blood spouts forth in ample streams! ... Ray. Bianca ... scarcely ... I ... support myself. Ah spouse ... Sustain me ... Dost thou see? That blood ... which bathes My sword, ... it is ... the tyrant's; but ... Bi. Alas! ... Ray. This is my own blood; ... I ... in my own side ... Bi. Oh! frightful wound! ... Ray. Frightful indeed! ... Myself, With my own hand ... blinded by too much rage ... Inflicted it ... On Julian I fell; And planted in him so, so many wounds, That I ... with one ... at last ... transfix'd myself. Bi. Oh fatal cruelty! ... Oh mortal blow! How many of us hast thou slain at once! Ray. I told it not to thee: ... Ah pardon me: Thee should I not have told; nor shouldest thou Have heard of it, till it was done: ... and yet, At all events, I was constrain'd to do it. It grieves me that to consummate the deed My strength allows not ... If it was a crime, I come to expiate it with my blood, Before thine eyes ... But oh! I hear the cry Of liberty more fervently resound! And I am dying here! ... Bi. Oh heaven! and ... fell ... Lorenzo ... also? ... Ray. A most strict injunction I gave to his assailant for this purpose. I shall die unlamenting, if I leave Safe, and in liberty, my sire, my spouse, My children, and my fellow-citizens. Bi. Thou leavest me to tears ... But will I live? Give me thy sword ... Ray. Bianca ... Oh sweet spouse ... Part of myself ... remember thou'rt a mother ... Thou for our children should'st consent to live; Live for our children, ... if thou lovest me ... Bi. Oh children! .. But the dissonance increases ... Ray. And it approaches; ... and I seem to hear Discordant cries ... Run to the little ones, And leave them not; to their protection fly.â Alas! ... for me ... no hope ... of life ... remains ... Thou seest ... that ... I am ... a dying man ... Bi. What shall I do? ... Near whom shall I remain? ... What do I hear? ... The cry of âSlay the traitor!â The traitor, who? ... Ray. The vanquish'd is the traitor. SCENE THE SIXTH. Lorenzo, Guglielmo, Bianca, Raymond, and a reinforcement of Soldiers. Lo. Slay him! Ray. Oh sight! Bi. And dost thou live, my brother? Have pity ... Lo. Here the miscreant sought a refuge; And slunk from danger to his consort's arms. In vain; drag him force. Bi. My spouse! ... my children! ... Ray. Thou manacled, oh father! ... Gu. And thou wounded! Lo. Oh! what do I behold? Thy faithless blood Thou sheddest from thy side! Now, who forestall'd My arm? Ray. Mine; but it err'd: this was a blow Aim'd at thy brother's heart. But he from me Had many more like this. Lo. Dead is my brother; But I live, yes, I live; and to kill me, A soul unlike that of an inexpert, That of a perjured, and a dastard priest, Was needful. Salviati lifeless fell; And with him fell his comrades: I reserved Thy father only, that to see thy death Ere he gain'd his, might aggravate his pangs. Bi. What boots this cruelty? He languishes Half dead ... Lo. And thus half dead, do I exult ... Bi. He hath the punishment of his offence. Lo. What do I see? Dost thou embrace a wretch Stain'd with thy brother's blood? Bi. He is my husband ... And he is dying ... Ray. Whence dost thou beseech him?â See, if thy death were trusted to my power, Whether thou wouldest live. He plants a sword in his heart, which he had hidden at the arrival of Lorenzo. Bi. What hast thou done? Ray. I ... never ... strike ... in vain ... Gu. Oh son! ... Ray. Oh father! Imitate me. Behold the sword. Bi. 'Tis mine. Lo. No, it is mine He wrests the sword from the hand of Guglielmo, which, cast to him by Raymond, he had snatched up. ... Thou murderer of my brother, How many other deaths, oh sword, art thou Ordain'd to give! Ray. Consort, farewell ... for ever ... Bi. And shall I live? ... Gu. Oh terrible sight!âQuick, quick, Put me to death: why dost thou hesitate? Lo. Now to thy infamous torture thou shalt go.â Meanwhile by force from that unworthy neck Sever the weeping lady. Time alone Can sooth her grief.âAnd time alone can prove That I'm no tyrant, and that these are traitors. END OF VOL. II.</field>
