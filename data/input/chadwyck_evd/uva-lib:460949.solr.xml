      <field name="fulltext">THE TRUE TRAGEDY OF RIENZI TRIBUNE OF ROME</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO MY FATHER I DEDICATE THIS DRAMA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The following Drama was written with a view to its possible production on the stage, in an abridged form; but having heard that a play on the same subject is now in preparation at one of the principal theatres in London, I have decided to print it. My conception of Rienzi's character, and treatment of his story, are founded directly upon the old Italian chronicles, and other historical documents relating to his life and times; but I have not scrupled to make use of Lord Lytton's brilliant novel wherever it suited my purpose. I am especially indebted to it for the dramatic manner in which Pandolfo di Guido, the influential citizen beheaded by Rienzi, and Cecco del Vecchio, his assassin, are made types of two different classes of the Roman people, at first favourable to him, but afterwards disaffected. Many of the most striking situations in my Drama, as in the novel, are simply representations of recorded facts. I have endeavoured to avoid those romantic flights of fancy by which Lord Lytton has given an air of improbability to a work founded upon careful historical study, and in many ways a vivid picture of the world in which Rienzi moved and worked.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âRome. Before the Portico of Octavia. In the centre, an arch, through which is seen the entrance to Sant' Angelo in Pescheriaâa picture painted on the side of the arch. Citizens gradually collect at the back of the stage, curiously examining the picture. Enter Gualtier de MontrÃ©al, with his brother Rambault. Ramb. And this is Rome! The grim she-wolf grows old. Mont. And gaunter every day. Ramb. Yet her lean dugs, Which nursed the whelps of greatness, ne'er run dry Of milk that feeds ambition. Mont. One might be Late foster-brother, then, of Romulus? Ramb. And grow to something mightier than the time Brings feebly forth. Mont. Dreams, Rambault, scholar's dreamsâ Thou hast snuft up CÃ¦sar's dust, and that breeds dreams. What's Rome to unschooled soldiers, such as I, More than the quarry to the hawk? Ramb. The crown Of a great warrior's fair ambition. Mont. Pshaw! A word, a dream, a fancyâwhat's ambition? Ramb. The love of power. Mont. I have it. When the time Turns like the wheel of Fortune, Fortune's soldier Is Fortune's deputy, and turns the wheel On which kings rise and fall. Ramb. The love of place, Name, worship, fame. Mont. I have them, lad, I have them. Fra Moreale's name shines bright enough To read without a candleâWhat is here To set these idlers staring? 1st Cit. Broke thy counter, sayest thou? And for what? 2nd Cit. Ay, ay, they broke my counter, flung my loaves into the street, and would have broke my head as well, but that, like a rabbit that dreads the weazel, I have a back-door to my burrow. And all for what? Because my cart was seen some twice or thrice at the gate of the Palazzo Orsiniâbut twice or thrice! 1st Cit. But who did this? 2nd Cit. Who, man? Who eats our flesh, drinks our blood, treads upon our necks, and pays us not a brown soldo to buy sticking-plaster to patch together our picked bones? Who but Colonna's cursed Germans? 1st Cit. Comfort thyself with the thought that Orsino's would have done worse, for the good of the people. Let us thank God we have heads to be broke, houses to be sacked, wives to be carried off, by the people's guardians, for the good of the people. Enter Cecco del Vecchio, pushing through the crowd. Cecco. Where is this picture? 3rd Cit. Yonder. Cecco. On the very arch! 'Twas not there yesterday? A Fishwife. All the fishmarket was blind, if so. Cecco. Rienzi's doingâeh? 1st Cit. Rienzi's or the Devil's. When the Barons cut a throat or two, Rienzi paints a picture. Cecco. He makes the very stones of Rome to speakâ better things, signor, than most mouths have breath for. 2nd Cit. Per Bacco! they speak in parables. 1st Cit. No marvel they speak dark things by daylight, when night finds them tongues. Fishwife. He sleeps, God bless him, no more than an eel, painting pictures all night, and making speeches all day, as active as an eel, and as bold to speak up for the widow and the fatherless. Cecco. Rienzi is the tongue of Romeâthe people's tongue. Ramb. (aside to Mont.). Who may Rienzi be? Mont. (aside to Ramb.). The last new name Blown on the popular breath. Let us hear more. 3rd Cit. Here comes Gianni the Barber, his fat paunch as full of news as a pedlar's wallet. Enter Gianni Rosso. Gianni R. Save you, sirs! Have you heard the news? Cecco. What news? Gianni R. Baccio di Pietro's shopâthe goldsmith'sâ 2nd Cit. Gutted, like mine? Gianni R. Worse, per Bacco! worse! Cecco. Out with it, man; what worse? Gianni R. Broken into last night, and his fair wife forced from him. 'Tis true as I stand in my skin. 1st Cit. That's no great news in this year of grace 1347. Which of our worshipful lords has done this? Gianni R. Messer Martino di Porto. Tuesday next he marries a fair widow, and rich withalâ Madonna Masia degli Alberteschiâand to show her his youth, he must needs be raking. Fisherman. This widow will be a better haul for him than the galley he wrecked the other day. 3rd Cit. All's fish that comes to his net. Fra Moreale himself is no greater robber. Ramb. (aside to Mont.). Do you hear that, brother? How smells this flower of your fame? Mont. (aside to Ramb.). This must be the galley with the treasure of the Queen of Naples, in which we sailed from Marseilles. We, too, owe this Baron a grudge. Fishwife. May the Holy Fishermen keep us from the nets of all ribalds like him! But what a fair gentlewoman can see in a gluttonous fat swine! Well, God made us all. 4th Cit. Curses on him! This is not the first home he has harried. Gianni R. He is but young, too, to be so dissolute. But, as they tell me, in his Holiness's Court at Avignon such things are counted but gallantries. Cecco. 'Tis not yet so in Rome, and may God keep us from such manners? All. Amen! Gianni R. I hold his confessor, Fra Pippo of Santa Anastasia, for the worser man. Fishwife. Well, God made us all. Young nobles must needs have hot blood. But for rape and murder and the debauching of convents, if the devil does not roast some of them for it, he is not worth his keepâ and there's good religion for that. Cecco. And does Rienzi know all this? Gianni R. You should have seen him rage when I told him. I gave him my mind on the Barons' politics. Cecco. And what says he? Gianni R. That the time draws near when such wrongs shall be righted. All. God bless Rienzi! Our only hope is in him. Ramb. (aside to Mont.). Rienzi's name again! Mont. This dangerous hive Is ripe for swarming. I'll know more of this. (To Gianni R.) Pardon me, good sir, can you tell me aught of this Rienzi, whose name every wind of Rome blows in one's face? Gianni R. Of Rienzi sir? That I can, sirâno one better. Yes, sir, simple man as I stand here, I am uncle to the great Rienzi, who is indeed in some sort my disciple or pupil. I have fed his infant lips, sir, with the milk of eloquence. Cecco (aside). Hark to this pie! Mont. Indeedâand you, sir? Gianni R. Me, sir? I am a poor philosopher, at your worship's service. Cecco (aside). Ouf! a liar! a liar! Mont. By the shears at thy belt, and the comb at thy ear, I should have taken thee for a barber. Gianni R. The barber's mystery is, indeed, my quality or modality. I am barber per accidens; but my vera essentia is philosopher. I'll trim your beard in the way of trade, and discourse of the beauties of Tully for the love of eloquence. I'll breathe you a vein secundem artem, or cast your nativity according to the method of Alpharamus or Ajax the SabÃ¦an. Mont. Truly a wise barber. Gianni R. Study, sir, study. I have always loved study. Will you be blooded, sir? Many of our nobles do greatly affect to be blooded in this month of May, against hot humours. (To Ramb.). Or you, sir? Mont. It is not our habit. For myself, my blood has oftener taken the air on the sword of a soldier than the lancet of a barber. Gianni R. Our habits of action, sir, as I have noted, hang much upon the habit of our bodies. Now the sanguineous humourâ Mont. Be that as Heaven wills, friend. I asked thee of Rienzi, not of the sanguineous humour. Gianni R. I crave your worship's pardon. I have cast Rienzi's nativity. He mounts, sir, he mounts; and higher yet must he go. A few years ago a poor scholar; then Notary Public, with the Pandects on the tip of his tongue; then ambassador to Pope Clement in the matter of the Jubilee; then back from Avignon with his Holiness's favourable answer in his satchellâlauded by the Pope, protected by Cardinal Colonna, the friend of Petrarcaâ Cecco. The friend of the Roman peopleâthat's more to the point. Gianni R. Apostolic Notary of the Roman Chamber, with a salary of five golden florins a dayâ Cecco. And not a bribe withal; no oppressor of the poor. Fishwife. The feeder of the widow and the orphan, God bless him! Cecco. The withstander of tyrantsâthe doer of evenhanded justice. Gianni R. Give me leave, give me leave! This honest fellow, sirâ Cecco. Honest fellow, indeed! I'll honest fellow thee, thou pot-bellied prater, thou sponger-up of Rienzi's bounties! I am no honest fellow, but a Roman Citizen. Mont. Good master Roman Citizen, let us converse without rudeness. Cecco. Chatter who chooses. I care not to talk with them I know not. (Aside.) One of these foreign locusts that eat up the land! Enter Cia. Cia. Gianni! Gianni Rosso, I say! Where is that husband of mine? Gianni R. What means this outcry, woman? Cia. Ay, at thy old work, chattering like a swallow in a bell-tower; and two of Colonna's night-watch with broken heads waiting to be salved and blooded. Gianni R. O woman, woman! Wilt thou never learn to respect the claims that politics make upon every good citizen? Cia. Ay, politics, politics. Every idle rogue that loves to hear the clack of his own tongue is a politician; every knave, every spendthrift, a politician. Much good hast thou got from Cola di Renzo, with his trumpery scriptures and pictures, and the Good Estate! What good estate can come to strollers and chatterers, but beggary, beggary, beggary? Come, come; leave prating, and lose not thy customers. Gianni R. Patience, good wife! You may see, gentlemen, what fame I have in my mystery, the trumpet of it being so shrill; and, indeed, I am now somewhat full of affairs. Will it please you step this way? My poor shop is close by. You shall hear a sonnet sent by Rienzi to a lady of quality in his Holiness's Court at Avignon, the Countess of Turenne. Some mad wags will have it that she sits as close to Pope Clement's ear as the white dove to St. Gregory's. It made Petrarch himself jealous. This way, sir! [Exeunt Mont., Ramb., Gianni R., and Cia. 5th Cit. There goes the Barber, led by his pole. 3rd Cit. I back the pole for the better man of the two. 5th Cit. And for the longer tongue? 3rd Cit. Nay, there they are well matched. But here comes an Orsino whom I love as a Jew, pork. When he comes up I vanish. [Exit. Enter Giordano Orsino, attended. Giord. O. What coil is here? More of Rienzi's work? The knave grows more seditious every day. Ha! dares he daub our very scutcheons out, To set his crazy fancies on yon arch? Halberds, disperse these gaping fools. Off, rascals! Out of the way! Enter Bishop of Orvieto, borne in a chair of state, and attended. Herald. Way for the Vicar of his Holiness! Giord. O. Way for this lamb come swaggering among wolves! I'll make no wayâon, fools! Bp. of O. What means this rudeness? My Lord Orsino, you are somewhat bold, You flout the Pope's self in thus flouting me. Will you forego your Guelfic name, belie The pledge your banner, blazoned with the keys, Makes to protect, not scorn, his Holiness? Giord. O. Then let his Holiness, the absentee, Come spend his Peter's pence in person. You, His vicar, herd with Ghibellines, while we, His honest Guelfs, his Romans, are put off With empty promises. Bp. of O. Your jealous heart, My lord, sets jaundiced colours in your eyes. I come to heal these feuds. Giord. O. Then pack from Rome; For here you lose your time. Go help the Pope To eat our revenues in Avignon, With Frenchmen, bookworms, ladies, Lord knows what! On, fellows; if his lordship take the wall, Give him the wall. [The Bishop is thrust rudely against the wall. Bp. of O. O mad and violent man! Help ho! Attendants. Help! help! The Bishop's slain by the Orsini! [Tumult. Enter Gianni Colonna, attended. Gianni C. Back, dogs! What, will you murder priests by daylight? For shame, Orsino! Giord. O. Comes Colonna thus, Into our bounds, merely to mend our manners; Or grow the Ghibellines so to love the Church Its quarrels are their own? Gianni C. The streets of Rome Are free to all to walk in, and who lets With ruffian rudeness peaceful traffickers May light on chastisement. Colonna's sword Can guard Colonna's guest. Back, back, I say! Giord. O. Chastisement! Now, by all the saints in heaven, You tempt my spleen too far! Out of our bounds, Or draw your potent sword. Gianni C. Have at you, then! Blows, and not words, for bandits. [They fight. Tumultuous cries. A Colonna! An Orsino! [They fight on both sides. Colonna's party, guarding the Bishop, are driven back. Exeunt fighting. Cecco. Now, would to God the Bear would buffet the Column, or the Column cudgel the Bear, till both were past all prayers! We should thus be rid of the two worst plagues of Rome. May you tear more than each others' coats! Enter Pandolfo di Guido. God keep you, sir! Have you heard the news to-day? Pand. The news? Alas! what news does every day bring, save what is old? Oppression, rapine, murder, is no news; injustice no news; lechery, cruelty, sacrilege, no news. Why, it might well seem that the angels of the Last Day stood over us, pouring out the vials of the wrath of God upon our heads. Cecco. Faith, you say right, sir. You have heard what Messer Martino di Porto did last night? Pand. And what these Barons do to-day. Some two or three lie bleeding in the streets already. Yes, I know allâall. Cecco. That's nothing new in Rome, as you say, sir; but here's a piece of news in Rienzi's hand, that we would fain have you read for us. Pand. This picture? Cecco. Ay, sir; we know your worship is deep in Rienzi's counsels. Pand. Give me leave, then. Here, look you, under the figure of a sorrowful matron, burning in flames, stands Rome; and to her flies this fair bird of God, Messer St. Michael, the archangelâthe sword of God's justice in his handâwhile the holy saints, St. Peter and St. Paul, cry after him out of heaven (You see the scroll come from their mouths):â âAngel, great angel, succour her whose stones Praise our good names, and lodge our hallowed bones!â Is that much clear? Cits. All clear, sir! Pand. Now, lower down, in the midst of the sky below the archangel, you see this little bird, which drives into the flames a great rout of falcons? Cits. Ay, surely. Pand. And here he is figured again, receiving a crown of myrtle from the Holy Dove; while here, once more, he places the crown upon the head of Rome. Is all this plain to your eyes? Cecco. All plain, sir. Pand. Then let the sense be as plain to your minds. Rienzi is the little birdâthe Barons, the falcons. Cits. Bravo! bravo! Pand. In this scroll is the gist of all: âThe time of God's great justice see: That time draws nigh, be ready ye!â But here comes Rienzi himselfâquestion him, if ye would know more. Enter Rienzi, in meditation, a stone in his hand. He is followed by a great concourse of people, among them respectable burgesses in the costume of their guilds, and artizans with the implements of their trade in their hands, as if they had suddenly left their booths. 2nd Cit. What hast thou there, Rienzi? Rien. What I have long looked forâa man. 1st. Cit. How a man? It looks more like a stone. Rien. A man, I say, a man. 'Tis ye are stones, And these sad stones are Romans. 1st Cit. How are we stones? Nay, we are no stones. Rien. No stones, indeedâclods rather, trampled down To woful mire beneath these Barons' feet. O Rome, where is thy greatness? It lies dead, And these cold marbles grave it. [He kisses the stone. Cecco. Why dost thou kiss that stone? Rien. I kiss the face Of Rome's dead glory, kissing it. Look hereâ This was a fragment of great Scipio's tomb, Who made the earth your proud inheritance; Which ye have flung away, as I fling this, To rest upon some dunghill. O base Guelfs, Toad-hearted Ghibellinesâfond slaves of spite, Who might be Romans, and the world's dread lords, Could I but put a tongue in these old stones, I should arouse such sacred rage in you, That ye would shake your cloddish natures off, And turn to stones indeed, to build Rome's wall! Cits. What shall we do, Rienzi? Rien. Do? not this: Bark at the moon of peace, like hungry hounds, And yelp when ye are whipt; or snarl awhile, And after fawn upon the hand that smote you; Or tear each others' throats when, for their sport, Your tyrants set you on. Re-enter Gianni Rosso, with Mont. and Ramb. Gianni R. That is Rienzi. Ramb. In the broidered gown? Mont. He looks fantastical. Gianni R. Hark you, he speaks! He's wonderful at words. Rien. O ye fallen Romans! Knowing both what ye were and what ye are, How have I wept, what rivers of hot tears, To see you still beguiled, like foolish fish, With gaudy nothings, empty paltry names, Which feed your starvÃ¨d longings with mere death! Your tyrants cry, Colonna! and ye die; Orsino! and ye die; Guelf! Ghibelline! And ye run mad to fling away your lives, Like the poor slaves, who, for your fathers' sport, With their dull blood made fat the earless field Of yonder mouldering circus. Will ye die Deaths which are shame, for such unworthy cause, And dare ye not stir in such noble risk As makes death martyrdom? Feel ye this shame, And dare you yet be Romans? Answer me! Cits. We dare, Rienzi. Cecco. Faith, you have hammered us hot, Now you may forge us as you will. Rien. 'Tis well: Would I could forge you to the fiery sword Which sacred justice wields! O Romans, Romans! How have I loved you, served you, humbled me To weep before your feet, that I might so Persuade you love yourselves, and love each other, And the great name of Romeâthat sacred name, Which all her wrongs, which all your wrongs and mine, Have, like sharp knives, cut deep into my heart, Letter by letterâye may read it there; For, like the pelican, I rend myself To pasture you upon its naked wounds. O fellow-bondmen, would that ye loved me With but a tithe of the vast love which here Bleeds at my breast for you! Cits. We do, Rienzi! We love thee, we do love thee! Rien. Ye do well; For, loving me, ye love the light of heaven Which makes men, menâthat sacred liberty Which visits you but in dreams. If, then, ye love me, And love yourselves, and love the Good Estate, What will ye do for me? The hour draws near When hope and death shall play like wanton twins, Each in the other's shape; the rosiest hopes Smile at us with the dreadful eyes of death; Who dares stand with me then? Cecco. I dare! Cits. And I! Others. And I! and I! Rien. Oh, now ye make me strong, A Roman among Romans; now ye build, With living stones, the citadel of Rome. Dare ye join hands, and swear to me this day That, for the love ye bear the Good Estate, You'll hear me when I call, obey my voiceâ Cits. As sheep the shepherd. Rien. Cast your lots with me; Stand by me to the death? Cits. Ay, to the death! Rien. Stop: I must test in you the walls of Rome, Whose strong cement is love, whose sturdiest arch Will split and crumble into ugly dust Without the keystone, faithful comradeship. Some of you have been GuelfsâLappo, come here; Some Ghibellinesâstep forward, Maso. Ay, Ye bear each other's scars, I think. But now Ye meet as Romans: take each others' hands: Embrace; forget your brawls. 1st Cit. I'm sick of brawls; There, frankly, is my hand. 2nd Cit. And mine as frankly. Cits. O bravo! bravo! Rien. That was nobly done. Renzo di Pietro, and you, Gianni Nero, Stand forward. You are somewhile enemies About a legacy; feed the lean ears Of scandal with ill words, the hungry paws Of lawyers with good crowns. Will you consent To leave your case to my arbitrament, Each choosing out some worthy citizen, To join with me; and take each other's hands, In sign of peace and gentle amity? 4th Cit. That is too hard. I stand upon my rights, And on the law. 5th Cit. And so do I. Rien. Alas! There sinks Rome's strengthless wall, by private hate Sapped and brought low. Ye stand upon the law, And on your rights? Ye trample on the law, And all men's rights. Farewell then, wretched Rome, Thy heart I held for sound is so corrupt, That it prefers hate, envy, clamour, strife, Lust, murder, blasphemy, continual fear, Continual poverty, wars, famines, plagues, Tyranny, anarchy, to peace and joy. I thought ye loved your wivesâand felt perhaps Some little ghost of manhood stir your souls When they were made the playthings, the despised And miserable playthings, of the lust Of ruffians without ruth; I thought ye loved Your childrenâand perhaps felt something rise Like sickness in your throats, when your young boys Were stabbed for sport, your little girls defiled With horrible debauchment; whenâO God, My thoughts choke me! Believe me, citizens Left citiless, that there will come a day When ye will call upon Rienzi's name, And weep when none shall answer. Fare ye well! Fishwife. Fie upon you, with your rights and your wrongs! Will you not patch up and be friends, when Rienzi speaks such lovely words to you? There's good religion for that. Tumultuous cries. Shame! shame! Obey the just Rienzi! the good Rienzi! Stay, Rienzi! Gianni R. (to Mont.) Aha! you mark how he comes back. There was his craft. Now you shall see him tickle these trouts delicately. But there my wife beckons me away, like death's spectre, from the banquet of life. God be with you, gentlemen! Mont. Good-day to you. [Exit Gianni Rosso. Rien. Here, then, I kneel before your scornful feet, And pray you loveânot me, but your own selves, Loving the Good Estate. O raise me up, And raise up Rome; make me to smile once more, And make the angels smile, beholding you Thus barter hellish hate for heavenly love. Thou yieldest, Gianni; Renzo, take his hand. 4th Cit. I ask but justice. I will trust thy word That I shall have it. 5th Cit. Well, I'll fee no more lawyers. Cits. Bravo! O bravo! Rien. This is such a joy As feel the flocks of heaven when wandering sheep Come back into the fold. Signor Pandolfo Di Guido, and you, Signor Giacomo Degli Orefici, there's blood between youâ A river of dark woe, which sunders long Two loving heartsâyour son, dear friend, and your Most cherished daughter. 6th Cit. Ha! Rien. Let me entreat you, By what ye both do love, the sacred name Of Rome, by justice, by that Good Estate, Whereof ye stand as sponsors before heaven, To put away this hatred from your hearts, This woe from out your houses, and this shame From your much-shamÃ¨d country. Clasp your hands In sign of that ungrudging amnesty A dearer bond, I hope, shall seal. Pand. Si'or Giacomo, Our fathers were close friendsâwell, that's a text Too old to preach on now.âHad other lipsâ Had other lips than these, which seem to-day To speak with heaven's own voiceâbid me do this, I should have laughed; but now some holy touch, Laid on the deepest fountains of my life, Makes bitter waters sweet. There is my hand. 6th Cit. Signor Pandolfo, I have hated you With an old hatred, which, like stored-up wine, I have been proud to quaff before my friends, Or sip in secret; till to-day, methinks, It taste; like vinegar. But, sour or sweet, I'll make libation of it all to Rome, And, as a brother Roman's, take your hand. Rien. O glorious earnest of the Good Estate, Which stands before our gates, in lowly guise, Waiting our invitation to come in! O foretaste of heaven's kingdom! Blessed minds In which the snakes of hatred and revenge Die in the sun of love! Be this a pledge That we, a band of brothers linked with brothers, Of just men, joined with just men, shall arise, Not to avenge our wrongs, but right our wrongs, And with our wrongs the world's. Now, men of Rome, I charge you to be ready. Cits. We are ready. Rien. Swear to me then by the most holy saints Who guard these walls, St. Peter and St. Paul, And by their blessed bones, that when ye hear, By night or day, my trumpet, three times blown, Summon the streets of Romeâby night or dayâ Ye will assemble here; will meet me here, To welcome to your homes the Good Estate. Swear it! Cits. We swear! Rien. By those most blessed bones, Which make our city sacred as the gates Of new Jerusalem. Cits. By those blessed bones! Rien. Then wait upon the hour; which even now, I pledge my life, comes flying like the dove In yon last picture that I mean to paint, And brings as fair a myrtle. When ye hear My trumpet in Rome's streets, hear in your hearts God's judgment-angels blow the trump of doom To tyranny; and hear them summon you, The Roman people, from the loathsome grave. Cits. Viva! Evviva! Long live Rienzi, and the Good Estate! Rien. And meet me here unarmedâsave terribly In the strong mail of justiceâall unarmed. Cits. We will, Rienzi. Rien. Peacefully go home, And wait upon the hourâso fare ye well! [Exit. Cits. Long live Rienzi, and the Good Estate! [Exeunt Pandolfo, Cecco, and Citizens. Ramb. Here is no petty garboil. Mont. By my soul, If Rome and empire lie upon the stakes, Here is a man worth playing with! Ramb. What game? Mont. The game of brains before the game of swords. I'll see Rienzi. [Exeunt. Scene II. âRome.âA Terrace in the Colonna Gardens. Enter Vittoria Colonna. Vitt. C. The Vicar in this house, to sup with Gianni! How will the old lord brook that? 'Tis Gianni's sport To bring the earth's poles together; first Rienzi He makes his grandsire's gossip, now he brings The Pope's own delegated lamb, to beard The Ghibelline lion in his very den. But here, I see, they come. [Exit. Enter Stefano and Gianni Colonna, with Rienzi, Bishop of Orvieto, Frangipani, Savello, and others, as guests. Stef. C. My grandson's guests are mine. My Lord of Orvieto, I trust you will find our Ghibelline welcome more to your taste than your Guelfic friends' God-speed. Bp. of O. My lord, I thank you heartily for this friendship. I thought to have brought healing for the sores of Rome; but alas! they bleed afresh, and I am, in some sort, the innocent cause. Stef. C. Ay, trulyâa dove whose olive sets all the ark by the ears. Please all, please none. What loss hadst thou, Gianni? Gianni C. A trifleâsome few with flesh wounds. Stef. C. None slain outright? Gianni C. Mere cits, my lord, whose blood costs us nothing. Your salaried soldier values his life too highly to cast it away in a street brawl. Stef. C. SoâI am glad thou hast squandered none of our stout Germans. (To Rienzi.) All hail, great Emperor! What news from dreamland? Rien. That the world, which stood upon its head, comes at last right side up. Stef. C. And thou wouldst stand upon its tail? Rien. Nay, I'll wag its tail, and then ware flesh-flies. Gianni C. Ay, if the tail grew out of the tongue. But come, as we give thee the Fool's license, let us have some of thy Fool's wisdom. Rail, rail upon us! This fallen capital shall be thy throne, and thence thou shalt judge the world. Rien. This fallen capital is the seat of fools already, for you Barons reign in it. But when I sit on the throne of my ancestorsâ Stef. C. What throne is that? Sav. The taverner's joint-stool. His father took the tribute of many a fair vineyard. Rien. Those that laugh now shall weep, and those that weep shall laugh. Gianni C. A most probable forecastâmore, more! Rien. Robbers shall be no longer Barons, nor Barons robbers; the laws shall be law, the roads highways; and even Churchmen shall have God's grace. Frang. Why, what have they now? Rien. The Devil's blessing. [They laugh. Gianni C. How wilt thou judge us Barons? Rien. As robbersâthe greatest as the greatest, and the smallest as not small ones. (To Stefano.) Your head, my lord, I'll have, for treason to the State. Stef. C. How treason? Rien. For that, being a Ghibelline, you have conspired with the Guelfs against the State of Rome. Frang. And what shall my fate be? Rien. The gallows, faith; for you haveâO you are a great Baron! (They laugh.) You, sweet prince (to Gianni), shall be my hostage for the good behaviour of your House. Gianni C. Better hang us all, in earnest of the Good Estate. But wilt thou string up our reverend cousin here, the Provost of Marseilles? Wilt thou have no remorse upon the clergy? Rien. Your good cousin is scarcely yet hanging-ripe; but a rich, mellow Churchmanâ Gianni C. Well? Rien. Would become the gallows very well. [They laugh immoderately. Stef. C. Enough of this fooling. You know I must go hence to-night. My son Stefano attends me. Our horses are saddled, and our militia waits. Good Signor Emperor, take this jewel in token of my homage (gives Rienzi a ring), and may we all many times laugh with thee before our weeping comes. Rien. My lord, I thank you for your homage, and will remember it when I come into my kingdom. Stef. C. My Lord Vicar, I commend you to the entertainment of my grandson, and must ask your pardon for this hasty farewell. Bp. of O. A pleasant journey to your lordship. God be with you! [Exit Stefano. Gianni C. Shall we see them to their saddles? [Exeunt Gianni and Guests. Rien. My lord, a word with you. Bp. of O. You are too boldâ It were scarce prudent here. Rien. Oh, my good lord, Treason is safest spoken in a palace, Under the King's nose. Bp. of O. Nay, your talk to-night Gave me the ague for you. Rien. What, for me? Rienzi is the safest man in Rome, And nowhere more than here. Boldness, my lord, Skims the thin ice of danger, when pale fear Goes shuddering to the death it shunned. You marvel Because, with fools who scarf their eyes with pride From seeing what they dread, I choose to play, Like sailors with the blind and bellowing waves, Over whose haughty crests they sail to port. I tell them truth in jest, and in dull jest They pay me with a bauble. Now, my lord, You know my purpose, may I know your mind? Bp. of O. My mind? I would the Pope could hear you speak, Or I were nearer him. I needs must own That those weak hopes I built upon the Barons Are somewhat rudely shaken. Rien. Ay, the Orsini, Who threaten you in the street; or old Colonna, Who scorns to flout youâopenly; or Gianni, Who loves you, as he loves myself, to grace His wit and his fine scholarship: well, yes, They are but weak foundations for your hopes. Bp. of O. I have been much insulted, and the Pope In me; yetâ Rien. Oh, my lord, give me but leave To set you where all insult shall rebound On the insulter's head! Build not your hopes Upon the shifting sand of Barons' favours, But on the rock of a great people's love. Bp. of O. A rock? The fickle mob, rash, yet not bold? Alas! they are most like a treacherous sea, Still blown about by gusts of rage and fear. To shun the sands and build upon the waves Were but a futile task. Rien. I'll build an ark, Shall float upon the wavesânot on the mob, But on the people, steadfast as the waves, And tidal to the moon of liberty. See you this roll of names? Men whose whole life Is to live safely. Think you such a one As this, or this, would back a losing cause? No; but, like prudent merchants, they'll take risks, Wise risks, for mighty gains. Will, then, the Church, Whose gain were mightiest, and whose risk but small, Hold only off? I have a hundred names Of Churchmen, who but wait upon your word To join me, heart and hand. Bp. of O. The Church's gain, Should you succeed, would certainly be great. Rien. Give me your name, and my success is sure. And, for the Church, three years, and all the earth, In Jubilee, will pour its wealth on Rome, As freely as the manna rained from heaven. Bp. of O. The ways, I fear, are most unsafe for pilgrims. Rien. Speak but one word, and I will clear the ways, And feed this multitude, whose hunger else, We are so lean, must eat our very stones, And leave us citiless. No man alive But I can do it, as the Pope knows well. My dear Lord Vicar, I have trusted you Early and much, trust me a little, late: I know you have a letter from the Pope. Bp. of O. 'Tis true, I have a letter from the Pope. Rien. And I can guess its tenour. Says he not: If all the Barons fail you, join Rienzi? Bp. of O. Your bolt strikes near the truth. Rien. Enough, enough! I see I have won the Pope; I'll win him Rome, If you, my lord, will use that liberty, His wisdom leaves to you, with that good wisdom Your over prudent fears would cheat you of. Bp. of O. What would you have? Rien. The sanction of your name For what I do; the Pope's authority To turn his revenues to his own use. Bp. of O. His revenues? Rien. Ay, of this Roman Chamber, Which I administer. This schedule here Shows you the taxes, net receipts, and moneys Now in my handsâbut one poor thirty thousand Florins of gold, which, but for sundry rats Which gnaw his Holiness's treasury-chests, Should sum three hundred thousand. Bp. of O. You would seize These moneys? Rien. I would crave, if I succeed, Your leave to use these moneys. Bp. of O. Oh, succeed, And all shall meet your wish! But I much dread These furious Barons and their mercenaries. Rien. Their hirelings love them not, and they themselves Rend their own power with strife; and now they leave The plundered city to go rob the fields. Colonna goes to-night, the last Orsino Brawled himself off to-day; and for the rest They scatter up and down. Bp. of O. Might you not win Some noble to your party? Rien. There is one, Or I'm no judge of men, who is mine already. A man of weight in your own see, my lord. Bp. of O. Who's he? Rien. A Guelf still Guelf, andâmarvel moreâ A Baron with a mind, a man who dreams Of a more stable State. Bp. of O. Who is this phÅnix? Rien. Cola Orsino, of Sant' Angelo. Bp. of O. Ha! a good name. Rien. The best in Rome are mine. Bp. of O. He is much followed. But you say the Barons Are leaving Rome; that meansâ? Rien. I'll strike at once. Bp. of O. O risk not all too rashly! Rien. To delay Were to lose all, when once my plans are ripe. Bp. of O. Heaven prosper all your plans! Rien. Your blessing sits Upon my brow, my lord, like victory. Bp. of O. Let us go in. Rien. Best singlyâwill you enter? I'll follow you anon. [Exit Bishop of Orvieto. My cap and bells I'll jingle here no more. So David left His scrabbling on the doors, to be a king; So Brutus felt his heart burst its dull chain, Snatching the dagger from Lucretia's breast, To stab to death false Tarquin's bloody power! Enter Vittoria Colonna. Vitt. C. The night looks fair in promise. What, still here, Signor Rienzi! You are sighed for now, Within, as too soon vanished. Rien. Nay, Madonna, Your poet here, among the nightingales, Lingers, not to be sighed for, but to sigh. Vitt. C. More sonnets to my lap-dog? Pshaw! no more Of these unreal toys. Something's afoot Among the clamorous and unruly mob Whom you have taught, for what you best can tell, To follow at your heels, more than is good. Rien. What is afoot? Street-brawling? On my honour I did not teach them that. Vitt. C. You have taught them worseâ Sedition, insolence, peevish discontent. Rien. That were a crime in meâso to mar all The blessed lessons taught them, day by day, By their kind masters! Vitt. C. You have put a tongue Into the ghastly evils of the time To yell for anarchy, and mere misrule. The woes that fall as natural as the rain, For all men's sins, upon the lives of men, You, with the art of rabble-charming knaves, Credit the great with; yet you talk of justice! O pause, ere you tarre on the ignorant folk, Who should be faithful dogs, to bay our heels Like rancorous wolves! Rebellion, civil warâ These are the ugly names of ugly things. Rien. Madam, I trust I know my place too well To sin so high. Rebellion? Civil war? These are the crimes of nobles. Vitt. C. Silence, sir! A daughter of our House, methinks, may claim, Speaking with you, more courtesy of toneâ Such sneers become you ill. Rien. Ah! Signorina, I spoke in thoughtless bitterness of spirit. You stand so high in my soul's reverence, That sometimes lisping courtesy forgets Timely to bar the door on rude-tongued frankness. You hold me, I know well, the ungrateful snake Which stings the fostering hand. Vitt. C. I will not deign To urge our House's claims to gratitude On your distorted nature. Rien. Gratitude! To gratitude! I had a brother onceâ Like your own brother, little Stefanelloâ An innocent boy, whom thoughtless venture led Too near a brawl. One of your noble House Slew him in wantonness. And when I cried O'er his fair head, yet warm in the bloody dust, For vengeance on the dastard murderer's life, Your generous grandfather flung me a purse, And sent me to the devil. Gratitude! Vitt. C. These are the dreadful accidents of war. To nurse revenge thro' half your tale of years For an o'erhasty blow, is savagelike. Rien. Yes, the sad agents of these accidents, On whom, methinks, remorse should sit for life, Dinning the ear of sleep, forget them soon. Why should not I? I nurse not vain revenge, God be my witness! But just God remembers The innocent blood which cries to Him from the earth, And He will terribly avenge it. Vitt. C. God Will punish mad ambition. As your friendâ For such I fain would beâI say, beware! Rouse not my father's wrath, or grandfather's. Gianni still takes his life as carelessly As do the birds; but they're wound-wary lions, Whom life has taught to hate the thing they fear, And kill the thing they hate. Rien. O noblest lady Would that we could be friends, ay, more than friends! If there should come a duel to the death, Which Heaven avert, between your House and me, And I should hold the fate of those you love Some day within my hands, the thought of you Would turn revenge, if I could harbour it, To gentleness. Claim, then, Rienzi's friendship; I'll earn your gratitude. Vitt. C. Grow you so bold? Who are you, sir, to threat and promise thus? Rien. The Roman people, madam. Fare you well! [Exit Rienzi. Vitt. C. Crazed, crazed with some stupendous vanity! And yet this frightens me. I would my father Had hearkened to my prayers, and stayed in Rome. [Exit. Scene III. âA Room in Rienzi's House. Enter Rienzi. Rien. Crescentius ruled in Rome three months; they say This was his houseâthe Emperor murdered him. And Arnold ruled ten yearsâthe Emperor And Pope, in bloody compact, murdered him. And now I comeâ Enter Francesca. Cecca! What wouldst thou? Fran. Nothingâ Let me butâ Rien. I am busy. Fran. Always busy! Alas! thou knowest no rest. Thy very bed, When not left cold, is but a market-place Where thou art baited with uneasy thoughts. Rien. Am I lean? Am I pale? I am hale and hearty. Fran. Thy life is squandered all on public things, Cheating thy flesh and blood. Rome is thy wife, Its rabble more thy children than thine own. Rien. What wouldst thou have of me? What ails my children? Do they lack bread? There's money for theeâgo! Fran. Speak not so furiously. Rien. O woman, woman! Stay, let me look at thee. Nay, my poor girl, 'Tis thou art pale. Where are those flashing eyes That made thy face the splendidest in Rome? Fran. Tears are poor beauty-washes. Rien. Tears? why tears? Fran. O Cola, thou wilt break my heart with fear! Where will this end? Where can these hidden ways Lead, but to ruin? Thou hast hid thy soul From me, thy wife, and yet I know too well Ye purpose something fearful. Rien. Heaven forefend! Dry up these foolish tears. Be beautifulâ Bloom like a cherished rose. I need thy beauty, As serpents need the sun when they come forth From winter caves to taste the air of spring. Go, buy thyself a gownâlet it be richâ Thou shalt have twenty soon. Be beautiful! I'll throne thee high; the proudest dames in Rome Shall wait on thee; princes shall bear thy train. Fran. These would be dreadful honours. Rien. Dreadful? Pooh! But some one seeks me. Go! be sure to keep Thy blithest cheer. [Exit Francesca. Enter Servant. What now? Servant. Signor Pandolfo Di Guido waits for you. Rien. Admit him straight. Enter Pandolfo. [Exit Servant. Now, my best friend, what news? Pan. All's happily sped. A hundred of the best in Rome are sworn To meet us on the Aventine to-night, Worth each a hundred namesâall solid men. Rien. Bravissimo! I too have done some work Since last we met. The Vicar's ours. Pand. This crowns us. Rien. But I have stumbled on a snake to-day. Pand. A snake? Rein. Fra Moreale's here in Rome. Pand. Fra Moreale! Rien. Sought me out but now, Proffering his sword unto the Good Estate. Pand. And what said you? Rien. What should Rienzi say? That the good swords which guard the Good Estate Should flash on robbers' necks, not in their hands. Pand. That were scarce politic. Rien. So spoke my heart; But not my lips. No, I have made a pact With that most brave and noble Cavalier, Gualtier de MontrÃ©al, Knight of St. John, To furnish me some stout five thousand spears By this day fortnight. Pand. How? Rien. The cost's a miteâ Half a year's revenue. Like you my bargain? Pand. Faith, not at all. You play a perilous game. Rien. Danger's man's native airâthe alert, bold mind Must tame at birth each moment's dragon brood To plough life's prosperous furrows. Mind rules all, When, grappling change with nimbleness, it grasps The old Proteus Circumstance. Look you, I've played This cunning fencer with a simple feint, And he disarms himself, whose treacherous thrust Had been most deadly. Pand. But, a fortnight hence? Rien. But three days hence, and this hot brain is cold, Or Rome is free, and may defy the world. Pand. Three days! That's brief. Rien. At Pentecost, my trump Shall blow the Barons' castles into dust. The Spirit of God makes every nerve of me Stuff of the elementsâa bodiless power I ride the air, whose fiery steeds I'd spur To the tempest's pace. But no more wordsâeach hour 'Twixt this and Pentecost must glow red-hot With action. Come; upon the Aventine We must keep punctual tryst. [Exeunt. Scene IV. âBefore the Portico of Octavia, as in Scene I. Enter Rambault. Ramb. Now morning breaks o'er Rome. There Pentecost With golden fire floods all the orient sky, In its full-throbbing life so beautiful It might renew these ruins. Enter MontrÃ©al. Welcome! What news from fair Perugia? Mont. My squadron will keep contract to an hour. Ramb. So you will win your trick? Mont. My hand is strong. [Rienzi's trumpet heard. Whose clarion's that? It hath an eerie sound. All's quiet here? Ramb. As ocean, in the pause 'Twixt storm and storm. Mont. Rienzi promised so. [Trumpet again, nearer. I know the Barons' brass; but this grave note Rings clear and silvery. Ramb. 'Tis a silver trump, And yon strange herald blows itâhe draws nigh. Mont. He durst not, in mere prudence, play me false. Ramb. Rienzi? Mont. Ay; but these Italian brains Are subtler than the snake that tempted Eve. I'll bide in Rome, and watch this fortnight by, While he matures his rising. Enter a handsome Youth, richly attired as a Herald, and carrying a silver trumpet. He ascends the steps of Sant' Angelo in Peschiera, and blows a third blast. A concourse of Citizens begins to assemble. What means this? Ramb. One of Rienzi's fantasies. Mont. Yes, yesâ He was too frank, perhaps. He has an eye That baffles question with its changing light. Enter Gianni Rosso, Cecco del Vecchio, and Cits. Ha! my old friend, what may this gaudy trumpeter betoken? Gianni R. Save you, sir! Rienzi's in that church. All night long he has heard thirty masses of the Holy Ghost for his soul's comfort. Mont. Is it his wont, then, to sound a trumpet when he prays, like the Pharisees? Gianni R. O sir, Rienzi is a public manâwrites with a silver pen, for the dignity of his office, and blows a silver trumpetâas, between ourselves, he would balance a lemon on his nose in open marketâto attract a crowd. His present purpose none knows. I am as deep in his counsels as any, and yet I know not. [Trumpeter blows a flourish. Mont. What now? The doors open. Enter from the church, Rienzi, armedâhis helmet borne by a Page. He is accompanied by the Bishop of Orvieto, Pandolfo di Guido, and a hundred armed conspirators. Three banners are borne behind him: the first of Libertyâred, with the figure of Rome, seated between two lions, holding the globe in her left hand, and the palm of victory in her right; the second of Justiceâwhite, with the figure of St. Paul, holding the sword; the third of Peace âgreen, with the figure of St. Peter, holding the keys of concord and peace. Cits. Long live Rienzi, and the Good Estate! Mont. What means this mummery? Ramb. Something out of sight. Rien. Romans! Dear friends! ye have kept tryst with me; I will keep faith with you. Lift up your heads, And shout; for ye are free! Rome, Rome is free! Mont. Is this mere charlatanry? Ramb. Wait, he speaks. Rien. Here is plain truth for you. Ye know the Barons Are foraging abroad, like hungry rats, To pillage corn. Well, we have stopped their holes, My friends and Iâtheir castles stand at siege; The city gates are barred; and Rome is ours, Is yours, her own, to hold against the world. Cits. O great Rienzi! Evviva! Evviva! Mont. Oho! Tricked, Rambault, tricked! This man of books, This tongue, this lawyer's clerk! Tricked! Ramb. Peace, good brother! [The great bell of the Capitol tolls. Cits. What says La Paterina? Rien. Hark to that iron tongue! It tolls the death Of hoary tyranny and ancient wrong. Our friends are in the Capitol. Cits. Evviva! Mont. I'll drive my sword thro' his heart! Ramb. O frantic thought! This is a man. Mont. The Devil, rather! Away! [Exeunt Mont. and Ramb. Rien. That bell, whose soul hath slept in sullen rust Thro' Freedom's trance, now wakens to proclaim Her victory. Henceforth its ominous clang Shall, like the voice of Rome's own conscience, warn Of danger and of doom. And now I fling My life into the current of your love, To bear me where it willâcontent and proud If I have earned your grace in what I do. Cits. Long live the great Rienzi! the good Rienzi! Rien. Have I your voice, to be your sentinel To guard the Good Estate, as I have been Its herald? May I live your proxy still? Cits. Long live Rienzi, the People's friend! Rien. God be my surety, then! His Holiness Confirms my acts, and, doubling your great trust, Sends me his blessing by his Vicar here. [Kneels, and receives Bishop of Orvieto's blessing. Bp. of O. The Church's blessing swell the prosperous sail Of all thy good intents, and waft thee safe. Cits. Viva! Evviva! Pand. Rienzi, thou hast freed our flock from wolves, Be thou our shepherd, lead us now to graze In greener pastures than we knew before. Cits. Bravo! bravo! Pand. Our liberator, be our governor, The sceptre and the sword of new-born Rome. Cits. Bravo! bravo! Rienzi shall be Emperorâ the people's Emperor. Cecco. Nay, we'll have no more Emperors! Voices. No, no more Emperors! Rien. If ye demand an Emperor, seek elsewhere. Degrade not me so far. But if ye seek A sleepless watch-dog for your city's guard, A careful steward of your rights, a brain To plot your happiness and lasting peace, Make me your Tribune. Cecco. Tribune, ay tribune! Long live Rienzi, Tribune of Rome! Cits. Long live Rienzi, Tribune of Rome! Rien. That is a title I am proud to wear Like laurel round my brow. Tribune of Rome! It throbs thro' all my pulses with a sound, Stern and majestic, as of Rome's best day, When men of iron and of adamant Were pillars of her right. But, with your leave, I'll crave your suffrages that I may share With this good priest, the Vicar of the Pope, The anxious glory of so great a trust. Do you consent, my lord? Bp. of O. With all my heart, So that my hand may heal the wounds of Rome. Rien. And now, come with us to the Capitol, Where we may choose a Council of the State, From rich and poor, to ratify our powers For Rome's defence, security, and peace. On, to the Capitol! [A March. Exeunt. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âHall of Audience in the Capitol. A throne and chairs of State. Enter Cecco del Vecchio and Citizens. 1st Cit. But two months in office, and such good changes in Rome! This den of thieves is grown as orderly as a convent or a camp. Cecco. Ay, since Martino di Porto was hanged for a common robber. Never was such good justice done in Rome. 2nd Cit. The very fishwives have ceased to brawl, and the meat-sellers to lie. False weights are become rarities for the cabinets of the curious. Cecco. Since God gave the law to Moses, there has been no such man. 1st Cit. He's as haughty to the Barons as a born Emperor, yet a plain citizen with the citizens. 3rd Cit. A Venetian of their embassy told me that the Soldan of Babylon had heard of his fame. Cecco. Is it possible? 3rd Cit. Most certain. But have you heard that old Colonna comes in to-day, to make submission? 4th Cit. Ay, he's the last of the lotâand the best. 2nd Cit. He has not kept his vow that he would pitch Rienzi out of the window of the Capitol. Cecco. Bah! He fled from the ding-dong of La Paterina, like a pigeon at the whizz of a bird-bolt. 3rd Cit. He found the Tribune in Rome a nettle too stiff to maul like Pope Boniface at Agnani. Hey! Here come the nobles to wait on the master, as tame as hounds at the crack of the huntsman's whip. Cecco. Stefanuccio too! Enter on one side Stefano and Gianni Colonna and party; on the other, Giordano Orsino, Frangipani, Savello, and party. They salute each other. 5th Cit. What! can these game-cocks meet without sparring? The Millennium must be near. 3rd Cit. Fear makes strange friends. The Tribune is a fire before which the fiercest beasts quail and herd together. [Cecco and Cits. draw aside as the Nobles advance. Giord. O. My Lord Colonna comes to take the oath, At last. Stef. C. My lord, I doâon your example. 'Tis bend or break. I duck my head with the rest, And bide the passing of this summer storm. Giord. O. Will it pass, think you? It whistles shrewdly still. Stef. C. 'Twill pass. How long will Roman weathercocks Point all one way? Giord. O. Then let us blow the other, For once together, in this upstart's face. Stef. C. Faith, I lack breath just now, thro' sheer surprise. Giord. O. You nursed this tiger; but, one word, my lord. [They converse apart. Frang. This submission of old Colonna makes the Tribune stronger than ever. Sav. His sharp-edged virtue will cut his own throat yet. But we must bide our time. His popularity is now in full blossom; he points his finger, and the timber and stones fly from our castles to fortify the Capitol. Frang. Twenty thousand armed volunteers, ready to swarm like bees at the first tang of his big bell? Sav. They can buzz loud enough; but a volunteer is an unbroken coltâbears you to-day, and kicks you off to-morrow. (Flourish of trumpets, and shouting heard.) His trumpets! Shouts without. Long live the Tribune! Giord. O. 'Tis but the mob, who grime themselves with dust, Wrestling among the horses' heels, for coin, Flung to them when the Tribune keeps his state. Stef. C. Ha! he gives largesse like an Emperor? Giord. O. His insolence swells so high. Stef. C. His cap and bells The varlet jingles still. Smile we, and wait. Enter Rienzi, robed in crimson and ermine, with his Tribune's sceptre in his hand, and attended by the Bishop of Orvieto, Pandolfo di Guido, Cola Orsino, six Secretaries, Notary Public, Guards, and Citizens. Also Francesca, her train borne by six Pages, and attended by noble Ladies, who fan her as she walks. Rien. (to Secs.). Now, gentlemen, your draftsâI'll look them o'er Even as I sit. [Secretaries bow, and proceed to arrange papers at a table. Approach, Signor Colonna! Stef. C. Signor? Rien. Ay, sir. We have but one Lord on earth, His Holiness the Pope, and dare extend That title no whit further than appears His delegated power. Stefano Colonna, We have summoned you three times to take the oath. Stef. C. Well, Tribune, here I am, to take the oath. Rien. You are wise. We have been patient, for the sake Of your grey hairs and venerable name; But, by the mass! you are wise no longer so To dally with your danger. Notary, give him A schedule of our laws. Sir, you shall take The oath anon. Stef. C. Content. Rien. We have been at pains, During your country stay, to rid your house Of certain vermin that do much infest Our old seignorial mansionsâwe have hung Your brigands. Stef. C. Brigands? Rien. Ay, such parasites Cling much to nobles. You stir not, understand, From Rome, save at our pleasure. You shall take The oath anon; meanwhile peruse the law. [He takes his seat, the Nobles standing in his presence. (To Secs.) Your drafts. [They hand him papers, which he looks over, signing some. This letter to his Holiness Touching the Emperorâlet that stand over; And this, to Lewis of Hungary, on his prayer For our prompt arbitration in his plea Against the murderers of his brother. (Gives back letters.) This, Of thanks to Petrarch for his golden words Of love and cordial praise, is coldly writ, Heavily phrasedâLivy or Tacitus, Not Tully. Praise, sir, from our laurelled bard Crowns us with laurels of immortal leaf, And should be answered in as sweet a strain As Orpheus wooed in. (Gives back letter.) More? Sec. No more, my lord. Rien. Then turn we now to business of the State. Stefano Colonna! Stef. C. Here! Rien. We summon you To take the oath. Humble your knees, and make Submission to the State. (To Bishop of O.) My lord, administer The oath in form and all solemnity. [Stef. Colonna delivers his sword to Rienzi, then kneels to the Bishop. Bp. of O. Stefano Colonna, on your knees you swear Allegiance to the Commonwealth of Rome; To keep its laws in peace, and with your life Guard it in time of war; further you swear Obedience to the Tribunes; and all this You swear upon the gospels, and invoke, If you swear false, perdition on your soul. Stef. C. All this I swear! Rien. Receive your sword again. We will employ you for the public good, As we shall find you apt and well-inclined. [Stef. Colonna bows and retires. Thus shall the toppling ruins of old Rome, New-wrought, be new Rome's pillars. One alone Of all our summoned vassals still defies usâ Gianni di Vico, Tyrant of Viterbo, Prefect of Rome. His term of grace is past, And we degrade him from his Prefecture, And will advance our banners till his walls Quake at our stern array. We credit you, Cola Orsino, of Sant' Angelo, Our captain in this war. Cola O. I thank you, Tribune. I'll be the embodied terror of your name Marching the earth. Rien. If he forthwith surrender, Bring him your prisoner, but in gentle guise; If not, attack with every art of siege, Destroy his forts, and bring him here in chains. Take your commission (hands document), and farewell! Cola O. Farewell, Most noble Tribune! I will be your sword. [Exit. Rien. Admit the Ambassadors. Enter Ambassadors from Prince Lewis of Taranto, the Doge of Venice, the Seignory of Florence, the Marquis of Ferrara, the Tyrant of Milan, and the Lords of Verona and Mantua, attended; their banners borne before them. Rien. Welcome, illustrious friends! 1st Ambass. Prince Lewis of Taranto, noble Tribune, Greets you with love; and for his much-wronged cousin, Giovanna, Queen of Naplesâfoully charged Before your throne with murder of her lord, Andrew of Hungaryâcraves your gracious aid. Hungarian Lewis and his barbarous horde, Tainting the air with slander, waste our fields; Till, like the Jewish patriot, our vext Prince Turns Romewardâas 'tis written: Misit viros Cum eis revocare amicitiam. Rien. My Lord Archbishop, it is further writ: Procul a nobis sint arma et gladius, Terra marique sit pax. 1st Ambass. Oh, my lord! Your wit leaps out like lightning, and astounds More than the thunder. You cap me in a breath Out of one page! Rien. Nay, marvel not, my lord; I have read Maccabees. Help but to piece The silver weft shot thro' the blood-red warp Of this perplexÃ¨d case, and we, with joy, Will clothe your Queen with robes of innocence. Meanwhile we test each strand, and watch the web. Sit, gentlemen. From Venice, sirs, I think? 2nd Ambass. Andrea Dandolo, our worthy Doge, Greets you, most noble Tribune, and desires Your friendship and alliance. Rien. Neptune's self, Taming to draw his car the boisterous powers That snort in the thundering surge; or, with a stroke Of his stern trident, making bastioned walls Yawn into sudden ruin, could not be A more magnificent ally. We grasp His aged hand, that with its osprey's gripe Wrinkles on its sea-prey. Come you from Florence? 3rd Ambass. The Seignory of Florence asks, my lord, To be admitted to the League which owns Rome for its head. Where shines her Tribune's face, Prosperity and peace, twin flowers of spring, Break from the wintry world, and warn old Time To turn for happier hours his tardy glass. Rien. We thank your Seignory for their good will, And swelling terms of honour. For the League, You are possessed of its conditions: all Whom faction, vampire of our country's blood, Has driven to waste in exile, shall return As living citizens. Does that content you? 3rd Ambass. It does, my lord. Rien. Then you are greatly welcome; For your content is as a precious seed From which all Italy shall reap content. 4th Ambass. Obizzo d'Este, Marquis of Ferrara, Sends gentle greeting to the Tribune. Rien. Ha! Whence come you, gentlemen? 5th Ambass. Lucchin' Visconti, The Tyrant of Milan, sendsâ Rien. Good; and you? 6th Ambass. Mastino della Scala, Lord of Verona, Greets you, great Tribune. Rien. He does well. The last? 7th Ambass. Filippo da Gonzaga, Lord of Mantua, Sends his felicitations to the Tribune. Rien. These eagles, then, yield homage to the wren. Your masters' mocks are changed to reverent greetings, And sweet felicitations. It is best For their own peace. Join you the League with Rome? 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th Ambass. My lord, we do. Rien. 'Tis very well. We crave Your patience while our Heralds make report; Then ye shall grace our banquet. Now, the Heralds Enter Heralds of Peace. Speak one for all. What welcome have ye found, Bearing, like doves, our olive thro' the land? Herald of Peace. Your name, my lord, strides like a Hercules. About the world, achieving prodigies. Thro' all the worst-famed nooks of Italy Bandits are ghosts, and deeds of blood but legends. To Avignon, armed only with this rod, I bore your letters. The Annunciant Angel, Holding the heavenly lily, could not win More reverence than I found. Rejoicing crowds Knelt in the gates, the streets, the dusty highways, As to the Host; the great ones of each town Met me with music; gay-clad village maids Welcomed my feet with flowers; grey-bearded men Wept as they kissed my hand; and fair young mothers Held high their babes to see me as I passed. From every hearth in the glad land rise up, More constantly than kindly household smoke, Prayers for the Tribune's health. Rien. Thanks for your tale. This is good news indeed. My secretaries Will fill your trusty wallets with new salves To make our country whole. Once more, God-speed! [Secretaries give letters. Exeunt Heralds of Peace. 1st Ambass. These sing like morning stars. Methinks the Tribune May gaze upon his new-created world, And, without boasting, say, 'Tis very good. Rien. Be God's the glory! What is done but preludes The more that is to do. The League shall meet In solemn synod in this Capitol, To make the fragile clay that shapes my dream Immortal marble. Gentlemen, your welcome Shall at the banquet be more fitly spoke Than graver hours would stay for. Will you grace me? [Exeunt. Scene II. âA Room in the Orsini Palace. Enter Stefano Colonna, Giordano Orsino, Savello, Frangipani, and other Nobles. Giord. O. Then you refuse to join us? Stef. C. Ay, my lord, On present thinking. Sav. If, my lord, your conscience Shies from your oath, late spoken, give me leave To show how you may read it null and void. Stef. C. God's bread! my lord, I need no lawyer's craft In mangling words to think it null and void. Oaths to plebeian knaves are empty breath, Their breach not worth a penance. But if oaths Broken could belch hell-flames, they should not let me From what my will resolved. Giord. O. Well then, my lord, I trust you'll join us. This seditious knave, Like an ambitious pawn upon the chess-board, Pushes himself to crowning. But to-morrow, And, by his knighthood, he will rank with kings. Sav. And make Colonna's oaths less empty breath. Stef. C. Can the poor farce of his ennoblement Make noble his base blood? Giord O. He gives it out That he's an Emperor's bastardâsmaller seeds Have borne great flowers. Now, cut him timely offâ Stef. C. Tush! let him flaunt his hour, and his own height Will cut him timely off. Such demagogues Are hungry wretches' dreams, and melt like dreams, Abortions of the unquiet age. My lords, I do not like your plot; nor, to be plain, Care much to riskâI will not say, my soul Upon its perjury, but my old neck Upon its rashness. Giord. O. Then, farewell, my lord. Heaven send your reverend wisdom a good nurse. Stef. C. Farewell, my lords! If you must play with fire, Glove well your fingers. [Exit. Giord. O. Curse his dotard's cunning! Must we be his catspaw, while on our risk He smiles aloof? Sav. You were too frank with him. You should have blown his pride to steer his mind Full sail upon our plans, flattered his tongue To word our thoughts, lured him to lead the way Where we would drive him. All must seem his motion, Or he holds off. Your half-hatched plot offends The nose of his grey craft and self-esteem. Giord. O. I am too much his peer to lackey him thus. Let him go. We stand firm without him. Sav. Surely. Frang. We hold young Gianni hand and footâhis head Must stand or fall with ours. Sav. And more, his father's, Though they draw back, checked in the greybeard's leash. Giord. O. Then, for Rienziâ Sav. All's prepared. Giord. O. Your bravo Is trusty? Fran. He's inflamed with private hate, And our rich promises. Giord. O. Then he dies to-night, Watching his arms within the Baptistery? Sav. If steel can do it. [Exeunt. Scene III. âBanqueting Hall in the Capitol. Tables set out as for a banquet. A crimson curtain conceals the back of the stage. Enter Francesca and Cia. Fran. One peep then, I dare permit no more. Cia. Gianni must hear all. Well, this has been a dayâRenzo's son, the brat I have dandled, a knight and a noble; crowned in the Lateran, and riding as fine as an Emperor through the streets; the wine running from the nostril of Constantine's horse, a marvel to see! And then your gownsâthey change like the clouds at sunset, the last the rarest! You should be a happy woman, surely. Fran. Alas! aunt, these robes of state smother me. I cannot breathe in them. Yet I stand naked to envy, hatred, contempt. Oh, you cannot know the misery! Cia. Contempt? Fran. He should have married a noble lady, not me. The ladies of my train tear me to pieces with their eyes; their reverence mocks me; their smiles are sneersâthey freeze me. Every word I speak is a fault to them, a shame to me. Cia. Spit on them, wench! Your husband can tame the lords, tame you the ladies. Fran. Nay, the world is turned upside down. Cia. What's this I hear? The Tribune, they say, bathed last night in the Font of Constantine. Fran. Well, if 'twere true? Cia. 'Tis a most wicked sacrilege. I tell you, niece, the people begin to shake their heads at these mad doings. (Approaches curtain.) What's here? Fran. I do not knowâstay, stay! Cia. Tut, girl! I love a secret. [Attempts to peep behind. Enter Rienzi from within. Ha! the Tribune! [Exeunt Fran. and Cia. Rien. (aside.) Nay, nay, good aunt, traps set for royal game Must not be sprung by foxes. Now all's sure. Perjured assassins, welcome to the feast! (Aloud.) Throw wide the doorsâadmit my noble guests. [Exit Rienzi. Enter Stefano and Gianni Colonna, Giordano Orsino, Frangipani, Savello, and other Conspirators, as guests. Giord. O. Now may good angels send us safely home From this accursed feast. (Aside to Sav.) Why look you pale? You will lose us all. Sav. (aside to Giord. O.). 'Tis you have lost us all With your attempted flight. Giord. O. (aside to Sav.). You would fly now From very manhood, on the wings of fear. Come, brave it outânought else remains. He comes! Enter Rienzi, splendidly attired, attended by Bishop of Orvieto, Cola Orsino, and other Nobles, and guarded. Rien. Welcome, most noble guests! Signor Colonna, You are right welcome here, Stef. C. Tribune, you dock Lords into sirs: struts every sir a lord? Are Tribunes Emperors? Rien. Your meaning? Stef. C. (lifting a corner of Rienzi's robe). See! The Tribune's duffel gown, gone mad with pride, Swells with imperial pomp, and knows no more Its cousins' simple serge. Rien. The Tribune's gown, The glory of his office shining through, Turns cloth of gold, and blazes into gems Whose splendour shall amaze the crowns of kings. Bid me not show you sergeâthe friar's serge Befits the eyes of men about to die, Not revellers, gay as we. But you jest well, There's guerdon for your pains. [Presents ring from his finger. Stef. C. (aside). Ha my own ring? The knave has ready wit. Rien. To table, friends. [They sit. I never felt more gayâthey say these gusts Of sudden mirth are harbingers of death; What think you, sirs? Frang. Methinks so great a man Should stand above such omens as are shed From trivial destinies. The stones of Rome Should bleed, the walls should groan, towers toll their bells, If danger dared come nigh Rienzi's head. Sav. The Tribune's life is like a mortal god's Whom all desire immortal. Danger sits Cowering afar, astonished and in fear. Rien. One loving cup, friends, to the Good Estate. [They pledge him. Am I so loved of you? Then what deep joy Must thrill you for my safety, when ye learn That, but last night, God's hand turned from my breast The assassin's steel! All. The assassin's? Rien. Ay. Sav. 'Twas surely Some frenzied wretch. Giord. O. None other could have dared Attempt so black a crime. You are not hurt? Rien. Ay, to the heart, sir. Grow men's consciences But fetter-slipping thieves, heaven, hell can bind not? Oaths but the Devil's base coin? Attach them, guards. [Conspirators are seized. O bloody perjurers, with how smooth a face Can nobles lap the dregs of such a baseness As would make mean ones sick to look upon! Stef. C. What means this outrage? Giord. O. Who dares breathe against us One tainting word? Rien. Damn not yourselves twice o'er; Your crime is manifest as blood on snow. [Curtain is drawn aside, revealing Council Chamber draped in crimson and white satin. The Council sitting, with Pandolfo di Guido as President. At the bar a Bravo, a purse in his bound hands. Behind, the Headsman, masked, and holding his axe. Rien. There stands the treacherous weapon of your hate, Your treason's traitorâlike a flattering sin Which tempts to ruin, then with unmasked face Laughs out a taunting devil. Sirrah, speak! Bravo. You see me in a sorry case, my lordsâat the Tribune's mercy, as you are all this day. (Drops purse, which he kicks towards the Barons.) Take back your gold, my noble patrons. Life tastes sweeter than a bagful of florins, with the hangman for your heir-at-law. Rienzi outbids you, and I should do myself a shame if I did not go to the highest bidder. Rien. Take him away. [Exit Bravo, guarded. Thus treason's dagger, foiled, Turns to an axe, to smite off treason's head. Giord. O. If you suspect, in your distempered spleen, Some disaffection in us, bring your proofsâ Proofs more substantial than a wretch suborned To swear away our lives. We challenge proof! Voices. We challenge proof! Rien. O matchless impudence, Outrivalling the horniest fronts of hell! Dare ye, with guilty thoughts which crawl and hiss, Like startled asps, about your perjured souls, Hauberk your fears in brass, and ask for proofs? Read your black thoughts in light. (Showing documents.) Fools! know ye not Such treason as yours is, scorched from its nest, Aghast at its own form, turns, scorpionlike, Its tail against its head. Down on your knees, And beg for mercy from offended heaven. [Bell tolls. Enter a Procession of barefooted Friars. Each Friar advances to a Conspirator, and stands beside him. What comfortable rites these holy friars Can minister to fit your guilty souls For merited death, be yours. The time is short. Sav. We are betrayed! I do confess my guilt, And beg for mercy on my bended knees. Oh, by your hope of pardon when you stand At Heaven's eternal bar, temper the fires Of angry justice with the assuaging drops By mercy wept! Tribune! Many Conspirators. O mercy, mercy! Rien. If 'twere but my poor life that ye would stab, I might forgive my murderers, though your deed Would shame the lost; for how have I offended That ye should hate me? What self-seeking crime Dares any charge me with? Stef. C. Pride, Tribune, prideâ An upstart's pride, a crack-brained dreamer's pride, Which takes its vain desires for Heaven's commands. I sought not your base life. I love you not; But if I stoop to hate, 'tis as the rose Might hate some noxious bramble that would choke Her buds with flaunting flowers. Rien. Your buds are cankered With evil airs. There stands your House's hope, That rose of chivalry, your grandson, black Among his blighted peers, with Sinon's face, The youngest perjurer here. Gianni C. What's done is done. I do repent the means, perhaps the end. Rien. You wished my death? I loved you! Gianni C. You have pulled down Our House. Rien. I have pruned the excrescence of your House, With all the festering rottenness of Rome, That I might build it new. Oh, by my greatness, I would have made you great, not 'minished you! Stef. C. Enough, proud man, thou wouldst have made us vassals Of thy plebeian arrogance. Better death! Rien. I thank my God for that plebeian birth Wherewith ye taunt me; thank Him that my youth Has felt the smart of all the ulcerous ills That eat the people's vitals; that my fate Made me the peer of honest artizans, Not yours, though I be higher than you all, In blood an Emperor's son, and in my mind I am to you as Jove's tremendous bird To offal kites. Oh, ye are nobles, are you? Dull, unambitious, lawless, thankless slaves, Wolves in your ravine, satyrs in your lust, Who cannot rule yourselves. Shall ye rule Rome? Or I, the elect of God? Stef. C. Act what thou darest; But, for heaven's love, no more bombastic words. Rather than hear them, stuff our ears with death. Sav. Nay, noble Tribune, hear not his mad rage; Hear mercy plead, and spare our guilty lives. Giord. O. Bind us with any oath, but spare our livesâ Try us once more. Rien. If it were but my life! But in my person ye have stabbed at Rome, And more than Rome; like Herod's murderers, Slaughtering the world's most innocent hopes. Go, therefore, And make your peace with heaven, while we confer Upon your doom. Stef. C. Confer! O hypocrite! Kill me at onceâmurder me here at once. My breast holds such a hell, no mumbling priest Can make me fit to die. Rien. Remove them, guards. [Exeunt Conspirators, guarded, and with Friars. Before we take the votes, I crave the mind Of the most reverend Council on the case. Bp. of O. I trust your Excellency may not whet The sword of Justice to an edge too keen, Against these desperate and misguided men. The scale that holds their guilt might plunge indeed To nether blackness, did not Policy Ballast its soaring fellow. Much I dread From such a ghastly stroke recoil too fierce. In Avignon your justice on the necks Of cardinals' nephews makes ill talk against us. Rien. All must be well considered which regards The safety of the state. God knows how gladly, Would He but change their natures, I'd grow mild, And make these wolves my watchdogs. (To Pand.) What say you? Pand. Tribune, your sword may smite off treason's head; But from that poisonous blood will spring new dangersâ Barbarous revenges, factions; hate and dread Among the great who favour us, and, worse, PerplexÃ¨d question in the people's mind. The nobles are to them the elements To husbandmenâsacred, remorseless powers, Who deal them dearth or foison at heaven's will, And brook not meddling: make the sun not shine, Or stay the operation of the winds, As soon as quench their lives. Therefore I say Cut them not off in haste, let patience tame them. Rien. States must be strong to pardon dangerous foes. The votes be taken. Ye have had before you Full documents of their guilt, and ample time To ponder well their doom. [Ballot-box passed round, and handed to Rienzi. The votes are even! (Aside.) And I am left a quivering thunderbolt Poised in God's hand. Sow this black bean, I sow A tree of vengeance, whose blood-tinctured flowers May bear accursed fruit; and sow this white one, I sow a tree of mercy, which may prove Hemlock to Rome. O God, this hour is thine, Make justice meek, or mercy terrible! (Aloud.) Bring them again before us. Re-enter Conspirators, guarded. Ye would have murdered me. Well, I forgive you. Ye would have murdered RomeâRome pardons you. And may the blessed saints, whose holy words Ye have blasphemed, grace you to mend your lives From stagnant marshes breathing pestilence To wholesome fields and life-sustaining farms. Giord. O. Tribune, I thank you. This is nobly done. Sav. We live your freemen. Be our oath renewed The earnest of our eager loyalty. Stef. C. I'll swear no more allegiance. Rien. I demand nnoe, Save what your conscience craves; for know that Rome, Whose might your pardon proves, if your hard hearts Be obdurate to mercy, has the power To crush you into dust. Therefore, beware! For by the holy gospels, sin ye twice, Ye shall not live to sin again. [At a signal from Rienzi, the crimson curtain falls. And now, Pledge we the Good Estate; not as before With cloakÃ¨d thoughts, but simply in good faith. Then free, your former offices restored, With loving gifts, ye shall depart in peace. All. We pledge Rienzi, and the Good Estate! Rien. This ratifies the empery of Rome O'er factious opposites. In her great name I take possession of the populous earth, Which she shall judge, secure. All this is mine! [Draws his sword, and waves it towards the four quarters. The north, the south, the east, the west is mine; And in the name of Rome, which I proclaim The Capital of the world, I cite thee, Louis, Duke of Bavaria, and I cite thee, Charles, King of Bohemiaâwhose rival claims To the imperial purple vex our peace, Here to appear before us, at the bar Of the great Roman People! Bp. of O. I protest! Rien. Sound trumpets! [Flourish, drowning Bishop's voice. All. This is treason to the State, And we depose you from your Tribuneship. Bp. of O. (holding up crucifix). The Church! the Church! You do defy the Church; And to the Cardinal Legate I appeal! [Scene closes in confusion. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âRome.âA Room in the Capitol. Enter Rienzi, armed, except his helmet and sword, and attended by a Page. Rien. Bring me my sword, and let my charger wait. [Exit Page. The wind I whistled for is grown a storm, And heels us gunwale under. Well, split all, To fetch my haven I must hold my course, Making the winds and waves but foaming steeds, To drag us on, even in their own despite. Now, no more mercy. Barons in revolt, With fiery ravage to the walls of Rome; Carriers robbed, clamours in the hungry streets, Taxes ill-paidâthese are the fruits of mercy. Enter a Messenger. What now? Messenger. Giordano Orsino, noble Tribune, Has, in your absence from the camp, broke thro' Your lines before Marino; and, 'tis thought, Joined the Colonna. Rien. Well! Thou mayst retire. [Exit Messenger. Giordano Orsino should by this be hanging, But for the Legate's summons back to Rome. Re-enter Page. Page. They are descried, my lord! Rien. Ha! The Colonna Marched forth from Palestrina? Page. Ay, my lord. Rien. And in what force? Page. Some thousand horse, they say, With other levies. The younger Stefano Leads them, with his son Gianni. Rien. Gianni too? Well, well! Page. The Provost of Marseilles is there. Rien. The more fool he. Page. And of the Frangipani Some two or three. Rien. Go, bid them ring our bell; And then gird on my swordâmy helmet too. [Exit Page. Gianni di Vico's loyalty's assuredâ I've laid him by the heels; desert to them With the auxiliaries he proffered me With such young zealâa very pretty plot! [Bell rings. Enter Francesca. Fran. What fresh alarm is this? Rien. New wars, my love, New wars. The peccant humours of the land, Drawn to a head, must have sharp surgery. Fran. O dreadful day! The Baronsâ Rien. Fear them not. Re-enter Page, with helmet and sword. Quick, boy! I'll wear for cloak on this great day The white dalmatic of Imperial Rome; For empire's on the stroke. Fear not the Barons. Last night St. Boniface stood by my bed, And, crowning me with laurel, chartered me His dire avenger on Colonna's House. To-day redeems Agnani. Page. Their attack Bends on the Porta San Lorenzo. Rien. Ay? Page. My lord, I think they are engaged already. Rien. Impossibleâtoo soon. Page. Cola Orsino Is at them with his squadron; and, my lord, I saw great clouds of dust about the gate, And thenâ Rien. What then? Page. Your banner seemed to totter, And sink away. Rien. O God, wilt thou desert me At such an hour? No; 'tis a false alarm. Farewell, my love, till I come victor back. My horse, there! [Exit Page. Fran. Alas! I dread such victoryâscarce better Than mere defeat. Rien. Fie, fie! defeat were ruin, Victory my foot upon the rolling world. All were well won, dare I defy this Legate; But I'm not yet the Hercules to grapple By its tremendous horns a bull so dire As he may loose on me. Fran. Sweet saints! What bull? Rien. For loving Rome too well, the Pope, who loves His ease in Avignon too well, lets thunder This lewd French Cardinal about my ears His threat of excommunication. Ribalds, Court parasites, tonsured adventurers, Are the Pope's popes. I must be gone; farewell! Fran. Perils by perils dwarfed! O come back safe! [Exeunt. Scene II. âBefore the Porta San Lorenzo.âOn three rude biers lie the bodies of the younger Stefano, Gianni, and Pietro Agabito Colonna, guarded. Enter Cecco del Vecchio and Citizens. 1st Cit. Rienzi has, indeed, most pitiably mauled the Barons. Here lies young Gianni, next him his father, Stefano, and beyond, the Provost of Marseilles. There are slain besides, two bastards of their House, with many other noblemen. 2nd Cit. And Giordano di Marino is reported dead of his wounds. This Stefano must be the last of Stefanuccio's sons? 1st Cit. Nay, the Cardinal lives. This is a dismal spectacle. Cecco. Will the sparrow mourn for the hawk? 2nd Cit. Give me the old free times and the Barons' pilfering, rather than the rule of a monastery and Rienzi's taxes. Cecco. Taxes, ayâthere I am with you. He calls us lords of the world: let him make the world pay our taxes, or down he shall come. He has borne himself haughtily of late to those who set him where he is. I mistrust this knighthood. 2nd Cit. His kith and kin begin to hold their heads too high. The fat Barber, on his piebald horse, rides over his betters in the streets. 1st Cit. Ay, with his ragamuffins crying, âWay for the Uncle of the Tribune!â Cecco. Ha! Does the old lion come to look upon his dead whelps? The devil grace them all! Enter Stefano Colonna and Cola Orsino. Cola O. Here lie the bodies, slain, as you have heard. Stef. C. God's will be done! Better be dead than be The playthings of this bloated upstart's pride. Cola O. Their tares are reaped. Baron, I feel how sore The tribulations of this iron time Beat on your wintered head; how desolate, With chambers blank against the tardy dawn, Stares the dismantled fortress of your age. Stef. C. (striking his breast.) Here is my fortress, sir, not yet dismantled. Methinks I am an oak, whose greenest twigs Are withered ere itself. (Aside.) I cannot weep; But every ruffian wound of you smarts here, Branded in blood upon my tearless eyes. I'll swear young Stefanello, on your tomb, The Hannibal of this Romeâbut happier fortuned! (Aloud.) I here identify, and claim these bodies, To give them Christian burial. Cola O. Nay, my lord, The Tribune, in his anger, hath forbid them More than pertains to common criminals. Stef. C. My curse upon his head! God grant these eyes May see his carrion ditched with common rogues! Cola O. This bootless rage is most unseemly here, But pardoned to your grief. Let me entreat you To sue his clemencyâI'll second you. Stef. C. To sue to him? I will not sue to him. For your safe conduct, thanks. (Aside.) I'll to the Legate. The Church, or none, must crush this Antichrist. (Aloud.) Farewell, my lord! [Exit. Cola O. Now, with good steering, we may pass the reefs; But rashness wrecks usâand I fear the Tribune Will greet the breakers as miraculous waves To float him over all. Enter Rienzi and his young son, Lorenzo, attended. Good-morrow, Tribune! Of all our bloody reaping yesterday Here lie the choicest sheaves. Rien. 'Tis very well. I have this day cut off an ear too tough For even St. Peter's sword. Cola O. Methinks 'twere better If, ere we take our ease for harvest-home, We gather that still standing at Marino. Let me march straight upon my cousins there, Awed by Giordano's death. Rien. I'll think upon it. Cola O. And act, I hope. Rien. Here is enough of slaughter. Cola O. Too much; if still the fires of civil war Be left to smoulder. Bid me quench them straight. Rien. EnoughâI'll think upon it. All my mind Is bent, just now, upon a solemn rite Which I have here to do, God's hand upon me, Who hath cast down this House, to raise up mine. Kneel down, Lorenzo, by this bloody pool Which pays my brother's blood. [Boy kneels. Rienzi gives him the accolade. Rise up a knight, Messer Lorenzo, with the further style Of Cavalier of Victory; and receive This chrism of expiation on thy brow. [He dips his fingers in the bloody pool, and touches the boy's forehead. Salute him, trumpets! He shall give Rome peace. [Flourish. Cola O. (aside). This is sheer madness! Rien. I will beat the sword Into the pruning-hook; and in the Church Of Araceli hang my olive-crown. Enter Vittoria Colonna, with twelve Nuns of San Silvestro. She kneels to Rienzi. Madam, your suit to us? Vitt. C. I know not how to shape my tongue to speak Words that may fit the changes of our hap Since last we met in friendship. I am come, Humbly enough, Heaven knows, to claim the boon Your friendship promised then. Rien. Madam, what boon? Vitt. C. Alas! but mercy on our fallen House. I ask, what's nought to you, too much to me: My father'sâbrother's bodyâand my cousin's, To give them loving burial. Rien. You ask mercy On those who have stabbed mercy to the death, And flung it forth for carrionâit smells foul. Mercy? Will men pull rocks upon their heads, Or thrust their hands in fire, and whine for mercy, When they are crushed or burnt? Will criminals Play with the law, as children at some game, And hope for forfeits kisses? Vitt. C. To a man I plead, not to the mindless elements. A man whom, with most ample cause to hate, I deem still noble. For the law, I know not What law transcends heaven's justice; and from heaven The blackest criminals may pardon find. Rien. Ay, after ransom paid, and penance done. Who pays the ransom here? Vitt. C. What penance more Can dead men do? Base insult after death Is savage, and not just. And oh, for ransom, If innocent pangs must pay, what have I done, That Rome, or you, should wreak revenge upon me? What has my mother done! What has the brideâ The three-weeks brideâof my dead brother done? Ask you our blood? We weep away our blood In slow-consuming tearsâdead while we live, Drinking the sorrows mixed for us by men, Our womanhood's daily potion, silently. Let the dead rest, who, standing at God's bar, May smile at man's revenge: but pity usâ Add no more gall to our thrice-bitter cup. Rien. O for more enemies like you, to wring From their clear souls such honey as outwells In your reluctant praise! To add one pang To your o'erflowing sorrows rends my heart; But how can I show mercy, yet be just? Vitt. C. O speak not like some devilish instrument Grinding out tortures that it cannot feel, With blind relentlessness; but like a man, With human organs and a human will, And full in history's eye! For your own sake Trample not on my prayer; for she will see In this no law, but the great Tribune's act. Be just to meâgive me these poor, marred limbs, In whose dishonour you dishonour meâ Ay, more than if you whipped me thro' the town, NakedâI feel it more. O bid me take them! Give me my father, Tribuneâgive me my brother! Rien. Take them, then; but at midnight, secretly, You must inter them. I will have no clamour Of women's tongues about them, no orations, No show of public funeral, to stir up The common people's pity. If there be, They share the fate of common criminals. Vitt. C. I ask no more than this, and bless you for it. O Gianni! O my father! Rien. Fare you well! Keep Stefanello from the throat of Rome, For his own sakeâbut that's impossible. [Exeunt severally, the Nuns carrying off the biers. Scene III. âBefore San Giovanni in Laterano. A comet blazing in the morning sky. Enter Rienzi in state, wearing over his armour the Imperial Dalmatic; his helmet coronetted, and wreathed with laurel and olive. Rien. No preparation made for our reception. Step forward, herald, and acquaint the Legate We are here, upon his summons. Well? Herald. My lord, The doors are shut. Rien. Sound all my silver trumpets. [Flourish. Insolent pauseâagain! (Flourish.) Once more! (Flourish.) They hear. [The doors are thrown open, and Rienzi is about to enter, when he is confronted by the Cardinal Legate, Bertrand de Deux, who appears in the Church porch, attended by Bishop of Orvieto and Clergy. Cardinal. Forbear, wake not the slumbering seraphim Who wield the Church's thunder! Rien. Cardinal, If you have aught against me, I am here To answer it, as to the Pope himself I have already answered. Card. If your pride Can brook no lowlier answer, I hold here Rejoinder which will make that answer pale. [Holds up Bull of Excommunication. Rien. What is my crime, that I should stand accurst? Card. First, manifest heresy, in setting up Your private judgment 'gainst the Church's doctrine. Rien. Tut! Cardinal, you know this cannot hold; You know I am no heretic. Card. Next, sacrilege, Which, like the leprosy of Constantine, Whose font your sinful body hath defiled, Clings to your soul, and must sequester you From Christ's fair flock. Rien. Is, then, a heathen's laver Too holy for a shriven Christian's bath? What washed him clean, why should it wash me foul? Card. This mirth is like a madman in a storm Mocking the bolt that smites him. Next, I say, Revolt against the Church's temporal power. You have left drinking at the silver fount Of all authority, Christ's Vicar here, For that vexed pool, the People; in whose mire You have mocked law's image, and affect to bow To this lewd idol that your hands have madeâ Citing, with contumelious arrogance, The Emperor to your bar. You interlope Between the Holy Father and his flock, Judging contending princes. Furthermore, In factious wars you have made dismal slaughter Of the most noble families of Rome, Whom, by your impious pomp and blustering pride, You have incensed against you; and withal You have laid hands upon the revenues Of the Apostolic See, to lavish them On your vainglorious pageantries of state. Rien. (aside). This bull's a waspish creature after all; Its sting is in its tail. (Aloud.) Thanks, Cardinal, You rate me as a broker who grows fat, Robbing his principal; but the Pope's abused. He reads me through the flaws of alien minds, Whose cold and flinty thoughts of me they shape To pebbles for his eye. What, Rome must be The purse for Avignon to void at will! Her Tribune, who to smooth the Pope's own way Exalts the valleys and makes mountains low, Must threadbare walk, that priests and cardinals May play the prince in purple, keepâ Card. No more! Bridle your scandalous tongue, or I shall do With hearty zeal what I had fain left undone. Rien. Ay, truth grows scandal in a Churchman's ear. Your charges make me madâI cheat the Pope Of his fair revenues! I, who have made Gold rain like manna in his treasuries, His barren feofs break into ear with gold! Shall I not spend, as steward for the Pope, On his own city, and for his own good, What as his steward I've won? Card. Come humbly, then, And, like a steward, render your account; Not with the audacious lunacy of your pride Blazoned upon your back. Put off that robe, Which fits your shoulders worse than cloth of gold Becomes a beggar's tattered gaberdine. You stand, self-pilloried, in braggart show, A laughter for the world you trumpet round you To note your shame. Rien. Laughter's the wit of fools; The base man's sting; the vain man's martyrdom; And oft the great man's herald. Let the world laugh, My deeds are prophecies, my pageants words, He that hath ears to hear may hear. This robe I hold a summer cloud whose radiance owns The splendour of its fount; but the sun's fire Is native to himself. There let it lieâ [Lays down the Dalmatic at the Cardinal's feet. I am Rienzi still. Card. Stript of his pride, Rienzi would be greater than himself; But 'tis his skin, and it must feel the rod, If here not timely shed. I call upon you For full submission. Rien. Look you, Cardinal, Why will you go about to blast your harvests? The gold I've spent I've made a golden net In which all Christendom is meshed about, Come Jubilee-time, for such a haul of fish, Each with his penny in his mouth, as ne'er St. Peter caught before. But for these wars, Made by the bandits whose too gentle fate You deign to pity, not a mesh were torn. Come, Cardinal, your blessing, not your curse; For this is my desert. Card. Your tongue runs loose. I am not here to bandy words with you. Submit you to the Pope, and rendering me Your Tribuneship, proceed to Avignon, To clear yourself, or you shall have my curse. Rien. To Avignon? When I'm as needful here As autumn sun to the vintage! That's impossible. And, for my Tribuneship, I took it not From Priest or Pope, but from the people's hand, And to the people only will resign it. Card. Is that your answer? Think again. I warn you That over your proud head an avalanche hangs A breath may loosen. Think! Rien. Well, let it fall, If folly tickle you to its loosing. Cardinal, You waste the Church's field. You may crush me, Though I have better hopes; but you'll enthrone Upon my fall mere anarchy in Rome. Card. Is this your answer? Will you peaceably Leave for a time your office in my hand, Or dare, like Satan's self, vain war with heaven? Rien. The Tribuneship is not the Pope's to take, Nor mine to yield him. Card. Rash, misguided man, Is this your final answer? Rien. Yes. Card. Then be Anathema maranatha! Fix the bull On the church door. Fall every one away From that accursed heretic, on pain Of the extremest anger of the Church! [Rienzi's followers and the people fall back, leaving him standing alone. Card. (to Bp. of Orvieto). For you, my lord, you are relieved of all Your functions here in Rome. Your health demands Some timely sequestration in your see, To which we now remand you. (Exit Bp. of O.) The rite shall be Straightway performed with bell and book and candle. [Exeunt Cardinal and suite into Church. Enter a Messenger, who hands Rienzi a letter, and exit. Rien. (aside). From Cola Orsino. Ha! What mischief's here? (Reads.) âMake what terms you can with the Legate. The Barons, with his connivance, have laid a new plot against you. The Count of Minorbino, MontrÃ©al's lieutenant, has been admitted in the night, and now holds the Arco di San Salvatore, from which I cannot dislodge him, the troops being mutinous, the people grown cold.â O lethargy of Rome's self-traitorous heart! (Aloud.) Sound trumpets, there! [A flourish feebly blown. (Aside.) I fear all's lost; my cowards melt from me. (Aloud.) Back, soldiers, to your ranks, display my banner! Fools! can the curse of a designing priest More cow you than a troop of German spears? Arm, Romans, arm! This Cardinal has betrayed you; The Count of Minorbino scares the town With his vile scum of cut-throats! Follow me All who have swords, and we'll enrich the fields, These aliens waste, with their pernicious blood! [They hang back sullenly, soldiers and citizens confused together. Voices. Can he talk the Church's curse from his head? Rien. What, will none stir? O cowards, renegades! Rome and Rienzi! Dastards, are ye mum? Cecco. Faith, he may fight his own battles himself now. We beat the Barons for him, and what came of it but taxes, taxes? Voices. Down with the taxes! Rien. Poor-spirited knaves, seditious 'gainst yourselves, Have ye no value, then, for what ye pay? Will ye, like foolish traders, look to find All profit for no spendingâeat up all Your corn, like stupid hinds, and sow no seed? Voices. We have reaped but a poor harvest in your wars and revellings. Rien. Who made those wars? Not I. Voices. Thou art accurst! Rien. Betray your shepherd, thenâlet in the wasters. I am wounded for your love, accurst for you; For this ye wag your heads at meâfall off From your allegiance! Blush, ye ungrateful churls I blush to look on you. Voices. He has had some wrong, indeed. Rien. Well, have your way, Abandon me, and I'll abandon you. I'll be no more your Tribune. Voices. Nay, be our Tribune still. Others. Let's follow him! Others. But no more taxes. Rien. Once more, will ye come on? [They hang back. Ye give me tears for arms. O slaves in grain, 'Twould stain my sword to prick such swinish droves To empire! Slaves to your own veering minds, And craving bellies, be again the slaves Of things that batten on your misery! Thus I deposeâO not myself, but you, Goths of your glory, Vandals of your power; Down to the mire that I have dragged you from, And grovel there! [He flings down the insignia of his office. Swine, trample every pearl That shines a star before the face of God Into debauchment! Dunghills will grow flowers, But rotten states no honourable thing. Begone from me, for I am gone from you; And when I come again, pray lest I come Your tyrant, not your Tribune. Off, I say! [He drives them out, then sits down on a fallen column. Accurst, deposed, here let me make my lair, A ruin among ruins. Rienzi fallen? Then Rome should fallâthe crumbling of each stone Shaped by the might of her imperial hands Make earthquake in the world. They crumble not In the fierce beams of yon portentous star Which, like the torch of God, hangs o'er the earth, Threatening its last combustion; why should I, Who am much more immortal, quail at a curse? Though it flame thick with terrors it must pass With my fair hearing. But will Rome's eclipse Pass with that curse? Or must I pass myself, Become a living legend of myself Wandering the world? O gall! O infamy! Better die now; and yet I would not die Till I've made breathing space in this bad world For noble things to thrive. Enter Cola Orsino and Francesca, disguised as Friars. Fran. Speak you to him, my lord! Cola O. Tribune! Rien. Ha! Captain, Come you to make a market of my life? The Cardinal will cheapen me with you. Cola O. I come to save you, for the next great move In the great game we play. Rien. What, back me still, Double or quits with Fortune; and such stakes As might make Emperors pale? O noble friend! I have had dreams, Orsino, I have had dreamsâ Great ones, I think. Cola O. The greatest dreamed by man, Since Joseph dreamed in Bethlehem. Rien. Oh, for Rome, I thought to have plucked empire from the stars, And made the changes of the watery moon Heralds of deeds accomplished. Cola O. So you did. Rien. But who shall with a foot stay Fortune's wheel, And so sit uppermost? You see I am tamed. Cola O. Tut, tut! You soared a flight too high for Fortune. Rien. Ay, like the wild swan with a bolt in his brain, I towered before I fellâmy height was falling. But who comes with you? Cola O. One you know. [Francesca throws back her cowl, and advances. Rien. Francesca! Oh, I must seek thy safety! Fran. Nay, thy ownâ My safety is thy side. Cola O. (enveloping Rienzi in a friar's habit). So, doff your helm. Good-morrow, friar! We must 'scape from Rome. Rien. Rome? There's no Romeâthe ghost of Rome has fled Back to the tomb. O cowards, slaves! Escape? Ay, they have left us nought to die for. Cola O. Tribune, You know my castle of Sant' Angelo, By Tivoli? There be our rendezvous, Where you may rest concealed, and spy events. The worst game, played to the end has hope for friend. Your children are sent on; your wife with me You'll trust awhile? You follow best alone. Fran. I stir not save with thee. Rien. Nay, good Francescaâ O noble friend! All thought ofâall contrived. Away, away! Fran. My place is at thy side. Rien. 'Twould peril bothâgo with this trustiest friend. In this disguise I'll range about the town, To hear what's said of meâthen join you soon. Away! Fran. I must perforce. Being a woman, I must be mewed from danger's honest face, While his worse sons, anxiety and fear, Are left my guardians. Cola O. Madam, your husband's sake Demands this trial. Fran. Then, for my husband's sake, I'll meet these torturers patiently. Farewell, My dearest lordâmore mine for all this woe! Rien. Farewell, my loveâkeep such a heart as I have, And all is well. [Exeunt Cola Orsino and Francesca. Now, in my fall's first hour, To plot again my rising. I'll come here By night, and with a pictured prophecy Preach from these walls once more. Tremble, ye vile, For, to purge Rome, Rienzi shall return! [Exit. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. âCamp of Cardinal Albernoz at Monte Fiascone. Rienzi seated before his tent, at a table, with wine. Distant view of Lake Bolsena. Rien. Well, if whom God best loves He chastens most, I might have saints for enviers. Seven long years I have lain among the abortions of the world, Like Nebuchadnezzar's stump; yet I bud greenly, And deep in Rome my roots push boldly still. Enter Rambault. What news, fratello? Ramb. You shall go back to Rome. Rien. When? Ramb. Any day You please to stir the jealous Cardinal's spleen. Rien. That's news indeed. The bilious Spaniard hates me, The more since I have helped to take Viterbo, As I did Toscanella. All this year With dull campaigning in the Patrimony, Chief of his Roman swords, not Senator Of Rome, he fobs me off. O for this gold To jaundice the dry olive of his cheek! Ramb. I have gained your suit. You ask three thousand florins, You shall have four, out of my brother's chest, To fee the pick of Malatesta's spears. Rien. Your love has crowned my life! Pope Innocent Loves me, no doubt. When Rome, turned Ghibelline, To gangrene runs, he takes off Clement's curse, And sends me back a Senator, forsooth, In this sly Cardinal's trainâa bait to fish with For Roman suffrages; but no spare florins. The Romans love me well, and in my name Have cast out devilsâ Ramb. Ay, poor Baroncelli, Riding the clouds upon your Tribune's gown, Fell, at your advent, prone as Simon Magus. Rien. He was a strutting daw, brave in my plumes. Well, his vile back's plucked bare. I say the Romans Love me, but still no florins. You are my friend, sworn brother of my dreams, My fortune's bedfellowâmethinks I see My youth rise up a phÅnix in your mind, As I burn out. Doctor, we twain will build Ambitious eyries in the Capitol, Like eagles of old Rome, flown back, to make A renovating tempest with their wings. Ramb. Too proud a dreamâit flatters bitterly. Rien. Orsino's deathâmy sane, strong captain's deathâ Leaves me but wing-clipt now. I am alone; How lone, heaven knows. Ramb. Your wife is dead, I think? Rien. Dead of the plague in Naples; and my son, My son Lorenzo's deadâdead of the plague. He was but young; but I saw hopes in him Bud thick as grape-flowers on Vesuvian vines Plagues are for nations' sins; but this smote mineâ Sorely too. You're still young. I think no fool In the world's lore, yet capable of thoughts That make the world a babe. If deeds but tally, You were an heir to take my mantle fallen, And smite with it a passage to new shores. Ramb. You make my heart too mighty for my breast. But forty's ripe, not greyâyour words' sad tune Rings older than your years: though your great name's Immortal youth makes them look venerable. Why, in this hour of triumph, are you sad? Rien. What is more sad than triumphâsave defeat? It means success too lateâthe bloom of hope Rubbed from the grape of life. We are time's fools! I am most near to weeping when I laugh, To laughter when I weep. Come, drink to me, And to the ironic dÃ¦mon of the world. [They drink. Monte Fiascone!âOn yon sunned lakeside, The cool-juiced clusters in their musky globes Cellared for us this nectar of the sun. These grovelling years have left a fever here Which wine allays. Friend, such a past as mine Ages a man. My memory builds me halls Wherein my soul, a minstrel old and grey, Chaunts epics of my deeds; yet shrewdly too It still can scan the future, and with eyes That hold some flash of my aspiring youth. Ramb. Your soul's more young than mine in vigorous life. Rien. But this poor body is not what it was. Ramb. You have grown stout, methinks, since first I saw you. Rien. Heavy, not healthy, brain and body both, And somewhat galled in the wind. My tongue's in chainsâ This pleurisy's a chain of Clement's forging, Which Innocent, who knocked my irons off, Could not remove. Ramb. 'Tis true they chained you, then, In Avignon? Rien. Ay, gyved me by the leg, A year, in prison. Ramb. Clement belied his name To treat you in such sort. Rien. Oh, by your leave! 'Twas mildness for a heretic unheard; Though, when the need of me cried for my hearing, I proved the Church's well-beloved son. When from the Court of Charles, the Emperor, Who would not give me up, I freely went To make submission to the Pope, my way Was like a conqueror's progress. Why, from Prague To Avignon I stroked my liegemen tame, Lest all the world in arms should come, by force To make me King, Pope, Emperorâwhat I would. Yet I was clapt in prison. Ramb. Chained tooâshame! Rien. Bah! I have supt worse broth than that, for Rome. The Emperor stood my brother, in his love, As by the flesh I am; and in my cell I dwelt in scholar's ease, the holy prophets For reverend counsellors, and for my friend The Roman Livius. Of my seven exiled years, Wasted in wandering, like its murdered ghost, About the corpse of Romeâbrooding, unlaidâ Seeking to move in her corrupted heart Some pulse of resurrection; and, anon, When I could stir but crawling worms, in Prague, A sudden apparition at the feet Of Charles, the EmperorâI say, of all These years, I feel the quiet of my cell Green in their weary waste of stretched-out sand. Ramb. What drives you, then, back to the bustling world You love so little? Rien. What? Have you ne'er felt That warrior lust which rages in a man To wreak himself in deeds? Oh, I come forth A barb-galled lion from the sheltering brake, Wily and terrible; and now, 'ware hunters! Erewhile I stalked gaunt in the noonday sun, And thought I had but to show myself and roar, To master meaner things; but now I'll make Darkness the scabbard for victorious light. But 'tis about the hour when waits on me The deputation from expectant Rome. Your brother's gold has girt me with such power, That I'll assume, with pomp and circumstance, The Senator at last. My gown's withinâ All men revere fine robes, but Romans most. [Exit into his tent. Ramb. There goes the age's brain, whose ranging thoughts Make other men seem merely babes at play, With baubles for ambitions. To my brother I am but a spyâa mining-tool, to force The treasure-house of power; and yet my needs Must court him, cap in hand, while my desires, Rienzi's homagers, look off in shame. With two cross winds I sail, and I must charm These dangerous opposites to make fair weather. Re-enter Rienzi, robed in scarlet and vair. Rien. Behold the Pope's new Senator! Ramb. You look bravely. Rien. As any two-legged thing in Fortune's smile. Some makes she naked, and some vests in vairâ The why's her mystery. Well, I'll welcome back Without a nose too keen, my country's love, Now it smells sweet again. Ramb. I'll cite your subjects To your long-injured presence. Rien. When they please. [Exit Rambault. This man should be a sorcerer's famulus, To raise the devil with. I have raised him now, And must beware his claws. Fra Moreale Would buy my soul with his unhallowed hoard, Tainted with blood of murdered harvesters, With tears of virgins sold to the lewd Turk, With groans of cities marketed to Tyrants By their own Priors. O God, what cursed tools Thou doomest our hands to! Gold! The life I deemed A battle turns a game. Gold! Must I stoop To enter Rome, so harlot-like she sprawls, Gold for my swordâbought robbers for my guards? Faugh! 'tis the scum of hellâ'twould blast my fingers, Like hell's foul clinging fire, did patriot dreams Asperse it not with dew of heavenly hope. Re-enter Rambault, ushering in a Deputation of Roman Citizens, with olive-branches in their hands, and bearing Rienzi's banner and a laurel crown; the Guilds led by Pandolfo di Guido, the Crafts by Cecco del Vecchio. Fair welcome to you, friends; your faces shine Bright as the beacon lights of Ithaca To the long-tossed Ulysses. Welcome all! Pand. (kneeling). We hail our saviour! You're desired in Rome Like healing medicines by dying lipsâ More than the Blessed Bread. Rien. To medicine Rome I'd give the richest drops that feed my heart For vigorous cullises. Cecco (aside). Ay, ayâfine words! Give us our trade again, and keep your bloodâ That's our best cure. The Senator, I see, Forgets the Tribune's friends. He knows me not. Well, well, I note you, Senator, I note you. Pand. (presenting banner). O bid our hopes revive, delay no more, But give your glorious banner to the winds, And say, Rome lives again! (Presenting crown of laurel.) Take, with this crown, Our reverent homage, and enduring love. Rien. Thus do I give my banner to the winds. [Waves banner. Who is the youngest here? [A Young Man steps forward. Rienzi gives him the banner. Bear this for me. Old Rome should march to youth on young men's feet. [He crowns the banner. Thus with the crown you bring me I crown Rome, So doubly crown myself. I'll thank your loves In the Capitol more fitly. Now, zeal's fire Burns up mere wordy stubble. To the tent Of this cold Cardinal, who interlopes Betwixt the Pope and us, not you and me; And we'll demand my quittance in such sort As will quite daunt his cautelous delays. And then, to Rome! All. To Rome! Long live Rienzi! [Exeunt. Scene II. âPalestrina.âA Room in Colonna's Fortress. Enter Stefano and Vittoria Colonna. Vitt. C. But is this true? Stef. C. Is what true? Vitt. C. That my brother So used Rienzi's herald? Stef. C. Sent the varlet Back to the bragging knave from whom he came, His two cur's ears clipt off, and, with the whip That flogged him, neatly casketed? 'Tis true. Vitt. C. I say, 'tis infamous. Oh, has our pride, Colonna's boast, stooped, like a vulgar kite, Upon the carrion of a mean revenge! I am but woman, yet the pride I know Soars in self-reverence out of sight of yours. Stef. C. Tut, girl! What else should Stefanello do? Vitt. C. A noble foe claims honourable war. Stef. C. A noble foe? A prating mountebank, Spawned in a washtub! Honourable war? The honourable war of times like these Is cut-throat against cut-throat. Rottenness Peoples the world with creatures of its own, And Rome's acrawl with them. Let me but see This ape, whose itching paw has grasped at greatness, Tumble, unpitied as the gibbet's fruit, Into corruption's pit, and to the tomb I'll take my age's outspun weariness, Blither than to my bed. Vitt. C. Must he so fall? He comes the chartered agent of the Pope, May not his second day outshine the first? Stef. C. There dawns no second day for charlatans Who fool the first away. His tricks are stale. Will he spit forth more fire, toss up more balls, Bring forth more eggs from sleeves, as Senator Than e'er he did as Tribune? Catch more pence? 'Tis not to do. I thank Almighty God The Devil has lured this blustering Herod back To diet all the maggots he has bred. Vitt. C. The people love him. Stef. C. The mob think they do, Loving the empty bellies they would fill, With lazy ease, from some one else's store. The people's but a dreamâwhat mortal skill Can charm the scythe of Time its swath to unmow, Till to-day's dust grow proud to find itself Marble of yesterday? Old Rome lies dead, And who would build his fortress on her grave Must have an iron hand. My life ebbs low; My bright ambition's flower is fruitless shed; My glory's sun is bloodily gone down; This war-worn frame sits heavy on my soul As armour on a battle-wearied knight, And I would doff it soon, and rest. Were 't not so, The prey that jackals chase should feel the gripe Of roused Colonna's lion. O girl, the rage To live, and yet be toothless! We're grown old When honour's wine spoils on revenge's lees; And I'm as dull and flavourless as death. This jester knave outgibed, let MontrÃ©al, Who holds him in his clutch, confirm himself The PodestÃ  of RomeâI'll smile and die. [Exit. Vitt. C. Alas! that noble souls, which should, like stars, Divine contagion flame, some jaundice moves To mutual bale, until Christ's temple falls To Babel as we build! Our House's blood, Swoln to a hungry sea, crying for blood, Will gulf at last the ruined hope of Rome. [Exit. Scene III. âRome.âA Room in the Capitol. Enter Rienzi. Rien. So, like a grey, world-wandered prodigal, I am come home, to find my father's house An hostelry for change. Where is my Rome? Where, rather, is her Tribune? Mighty dreams, Go back once more into the world of dreams, Regretted, not forgotten, but with love Buried. The King is dead, long live the King! Shut to the brazen gates that sepulchre The glorious past, fling wide the golden doors That on the future's field unconquered gaze. Now, what's to do? I stand this day more baited By dangers than a spendthrift by his dunsâ Dangers most vile, since to be shunned, not faced, Outwitted and not fought with. 'Tis our curse That we who scavenge this most filthy world Must soil our fingers. Miracles are done, We work with tools, and, scorning what we need, Perish our folly's martyrs, nothing won. [Rings a handbell. Enter a Secretary. Your abstract of the news? Secretary. Our troops, my lord, Beleaguer Palestrina. The Orsini Still hold aloof. Rien. 'Tis well. What of the town? Sec. The jealousies between the crafts and guilds, Which smoulder hotly, would in faction burn, But your authority makes faction dumb; Yet you are coldly scanned in several quarters, As you'll see here. (Hands papers.) The taxes are all paid, Though grumblingly. Your speech and proclamation, Both well received, have solved some discontent. Rien. (aside). This tallies with my private informations. (Aloud.) You may retire. [Exit Sec. The Barons' day is pastâI fear them not; But currish faction must be muzzled strait. But how? I ring my Rome with foreign swords, Making her foes her fence, till she be grown, And may defy her foes. There's danger tooâ These Germans are a fire, which in due bounds Will cook our food and warm us, but once free Will burn us out of house. There is much danger. O for the flame that once I stole from heaven, To make my country live! There were no need Of any earthly, dangerous, purchased fire, To tinker with. I should have souls for arms, Romans for hireling legions, zeal for gold. Prometheus mounts not twiceâperchance can ne'er The flickering spark he kindled once relume; Yet in my breast, a beacon lone, it burns, And while Rienzi lives can die not Rome. [Exit. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âThe Camp before Palestrina.âRienzi's Pavilion. Enter Rienzi and Rambault. Rien. I do not like the siege's dispositionâ You have thrown away advantages, and made A brief assault a leaguer. You have spread Your force to weakness, gazing upon rocks, When you should batter walls, or mole beneath them. What means this farce of war? Ramb. Nay, you should ask My brother Berthon, as the better soldier. Rien. Sir, I ask you; I shall grow angry soonâ What does this child's play mean? Ramb. The art of war Prescribes these cautious tacticsâBerthon says. We have burnt all their country, stopped suppliesâ Rien. While they are victualled for a year, and drive Their cattle through our lines. Ramb. I have not heard so. Rien. I have. Good Doctor, may I crave to know Why ye have so departed from my plans? Ramb. You left us some discretion, and in truth We dreaded mutiny. Your plan of war, If brief, would have been bloody. Rien. Mutiny! These mercenary dogs! By heaven above me, The rogues are paid to fight, and fight they shall! Ramb. When they are paid. Rien. They have my note of hand. Nay, this is worse than mutiny; 'tis sloth Upon their leaders' partsâor treachery. Ramb. Their leaders! Treachery? Rien. Your brother is a knave, and you a foolâ I think, no worseâthat is, in warfare, Doctor. You'll back with me to Rome. You have my love, Though not my confidence. Berthon comes too, Under arrest; and in his place Riccardo Degli Annibaldi shall conduct the siege. You are my prisoner, Doctor, on parole. Ramb. Oh! I was tugged asunder by two mindsâ Do not esteem me false! Rien. You are an egg, Smacking of its rank neighboursânothing worse. But get you to your tent and wait me there. Send, as you pass, my Captain of the Guard. [Exit Rambault. That stroke is played; and now swift back to Rome, For I must be ubiquitous as air, To keep my cause alive. On salt and wine I must impose the tax to pay these knaves; Most dangerous, but most necessary. Well, If this be borne, I shall make firm my root. Enter Captain of the Guard. You have arrested him, and quietly? Capt. As sleep, my lord. He dropped into our toils Like a ripe pear into a maiden's lap. Rien. Good. And this woman that you told me of? Capt. She waits without, my lord. Rien. See her disarmed, And let her enter straight. Capt. She's searched, my lord. Rien. Be sure she has no secret knife about her; Though not a Roman, she may stab at Rome. [Exit Captain. Enter Woman. Your business, dame, and briefly. Woman. Senator, I seek a just revenge on one, methinks, Should be to you as hateful as the plague. Rien. Who's he? Woman. Fra Moreale, as they call him. Rien. He! And what power have I to right your wrong? Woman. I was his faithful servant, Senator, Till he debauched my daughter. Now I'd be His hangman, if you please. Rien. How, if I please? Woman. He is in Rome, my lord. Rien. What, he in Rome? Now? Not alone? Woman. In Rome, my lord, alone, And in disguise, to bring his plots against you To quiet ripeness. You may take him now With proofs against his life. Rien. (aside). There's no report Of this upon my papers. Have my spies Turned bats in daylight? (Aloud.) Make this promise true, And name your own reward. Woman. His soul to hell! Come back to Rome, and let me choose my time; I'll bring you plump upon his tampering With your most trusted friends. Rien. Come, night or day, You'll find me prompt. Woman. Farewell, then, Senator. Do you your work as well as I'll do mine. Rien. Trust me for thatâfarewell! [Exit Woman. This creature speaks the truthâeye, accent, all Proclaim her honest. This is heaven's design To punish bandits, and to rescue Rome. Now MontrÃ©al, or devil, which you will, The blood-writ bond is forfeit in a sense Which dupes your devilship. Strike off his head, I strike the head from the cold snake whose coils Are strangling Italyâshe breathes once more! [Exit. Scene II. âRome.âA Room in Pandolfo di Guido's House. Enter Pandolfo, MontrÃ©al, and Citizens. Mont. I take it that I owe your gracious welcome To thisâthat being men who breathe the air Of the great world, not of dim scholars' cells, Men of to-day, not men of yesterday, This dreamer stales with you. 1st Cit. His credit wanes 2nd Cit. Our trade lies gasping like a wounded man. Mont. He is too weak to ruleâthere lies the fault. Pand. We loved the patriot in the Tribuneânow We hate, though with what sorrow in our hate, The tyrant in the Senator. He rides, Like furious troopers o'er a civil crowd, Over our council, and makes war or peace, Dooms death, and levies taxes, at his will. Mont. A taint of weakness! Like the bitter speck In fruit o'er-ripe, these tricks of tyranny In popular chiefs are preludes of decay. Pand. His temper is much altered for the worse, With sudden gusts of anger, heats of scorn; He'll laugh at trifles, and as soon will weep In such immoderate fashion as makes dread He may turn lunatic. Mont. Flaws of tired brains. Ah! when such patriots (bowing to Pandolfo), for a final flight, From where in happier times they made their nest, Gather like swallows, winter nips indeed! Pand. With deep regret for our unhappy state, Which, like a drowner with a rotten bough Snapt in his hand, grasps eagerly once more At one whose girt gives promise of more hold, We are prepared to hear you. Mont. Fairly said. So then, I trust, though, an unbidden guest, I have passed your gates, ye are agreed to find me No enemy to Rome? Pand. Our need desires To find in you a friend. Mont. You know, I think, that to my enemies I can be terrible; andâto be blunt, In soldier's fashionâI might come to you With threats of war, not overtures of peace. Your dam against my power, Rienzi, gapes A sluice to let me through, and ye yourselves Make breaches in him; take me, then, at flood, And find an opulent sea whose friendly waves Roll riches on your coast. My hand alone Can hold in leash the furious powers that waste youâ The Barons are tamed falcons on my wrist; The Cardinal Legate, to the neck in plots Ripe for Rienzi's marring, winks on me; Rienzi's sold to me. In brief, you need A PodestÃ , make me your PodestÃ  For but one yearâgive me of your free will Less than I might, if covetous, take by force, And I'll engage, upon my part, to guard The freedom of your state. [Bell of the Capitol tolls. What means that bell? 1st Cit. The death-bell: some poor devil dies to-nightâ A robber, as I hear. Mont. A robber? Ha! I will engage that for my year of power My army shall not mulct you in the tax Of one poor soldo. It can keep itself. Cits. Viva Fra Moreale! Mont. Think it o'er. [Pand. and Cits converse apart. (Aside.) Now let me in, to bide my hatching-time, And, like the cuckoo, these unfeathered fools I'll shoulder from the nest. Still that curst bell! I do not like the soundâit clanged before On my outwitting. (Aloud.) Come, good gentlemen, Our treaty must be brief, our march to power Sudden and sure, or we shall show like owls Caught by the sun. (Knocking heard.) What's this? Pand. Belated friendsâsome we have spoken with. [Door is forced open. Enter Rienzi, with Guards. He advances in silence. At his motion, the Guards seize Pandolfo and MontrÃ©al. Rien. (to Pand.). Giotto paints Judas with a fox's face; Thou hast a visage most austere and grave. Thy forfeit head, with its white reverend hairs, Would, with an aureole round it, from the wall Shine in men's eyes a saint's. A face like thine Makes trust mere dotage. [Pand. sinks into a seat. Mont. Noble Senator, What means this violent seizure of my person? Rien. O sir, it means the game is in my hands; You have lost your stake. Mont. I do confess myself Worsted, as ne'er before by mortal man; But 'tis my pride to think a giant dwarfs meâ Your acts are winged thoughts. Name but my ransom, It shall be paid. Rien. You heard that bell? Mont. I did; What of the bell? Rien. It knelled a robber's deathâ Think that it knelled your own. Mont. Talk you of death? Rien. Ay, death. Mont. Upon what charge? I owe you not Allegiance Rien. No; but to the hangman's noose You owe your neck; not for one single crimeâ For merely tickling these small traitors here To be your masked assassins of the State; But for a life of rapine, whose each hour Was a new crime. Mont. My life has been a soldier's, My honour proud as yours. Rien. Honour lies dead, When war becomes a trade, and patriot swords The hireling's slaughter-tools. No, MontrÃ©al, Your life has been a robber's; and your deeds Mate you with panders, bravoes, prostitutes, Slave-dealers, kidnappersâ Mont. Enough of thisâ Masks off, for God's sake! You have dipt your hand Into my dish already, dip once more; But prate not now of crime. I played for power, Just as you do, and meant to mount on you, As now you mount on me. You win my gains, And profit so by what you call my crimes. Let's be at one. I am your broken colt, Now ride me, in your service, where you will: Make me your Captain, and I'll make you all Ambition dreamsâa greater Charlemagne. Rien. Your devil's arrows are ill-aimed. You must Prepare to die. Mont. To die? You are mad, you are mad! Rien. It was the hidden bias of our birth That one of us should fallâthe world's broad highway Is not so wide we two can drive abreast. Mont. Let me drive after, then; but slay me not. IâI alone, have power to do for you What captive demons did for Solomon. Destroy me, and your Rome upon your head Comes crashing down. Rien. Nurse not your agony Clutching at twigs; but make with heaven your peace. Mont. Shed you my blood, you make my brothers bloodhounds To track you to your deathâ'twill be brief hunting. Rien. Your brothers are my prisoners. Mont. Saints in heaven, We are all betrayed! O cursed hypocrite, This is your gratitude! But your ill fame Will sound abroad for thisâit will be said That you have murdered me to seize my treasure. I succoured you in need, your empty name Filled from my fulness, and for thanks get this. Rien. I have undermined your mines. Let fame report My story as she may, you die to-night, Though I should die to-morrow. With what face Could I approach the awful judgment-seat, Where glozing fame durst never look, and say I left such bandits as thyself unhung? Mont. Unhung! I am a nobleâCavalier Of the most holy Order of St. John. Shall I be haltered like a dog? Rien. If so, Thou hadst but thy deserts. Abashless block! Has custom, then, so sealed thy conscience' eyes Thou canst not see thyself? Art thou a noble? A noble should act nobly. Shall men's sins Be cloaked with titles that should make each fault Look tenfold black amid their honour's blaze; And crimes for which some hunger-tempted knave, Who holds no trust, has ta'en no knighthood's vows, Goes to the rack unpitied, be the jest Of great folks' wanton hours? Out on such justice! But, while I live, this shall not be in Rome. By heaven! if I had seen some titled thief Steal but a cherry from a poor man's tree, And he had flashed his rank before mine eyes, He had been pilloried for it. Away with them! Mont. Must I die then, and by your hangman's hand? See! By this cross upon my breast, I warn you, Dishonour not my Order. Rien. You have dragged Your Order thro' foul mire; but for its sake, And mine own Order's sake, your doom's the axe, And not the halter. Mont. One last prayer. I ask My brother's livesâthey cannot harm you now. Rien. Their lives are sparedâI swear it. Now begone! And true repentance salve you at the block. Mont. To the most blessed Virgin, and St. John, Whom I have ever loved with all my heart, I do commend my soul. O Romans, Romans! I die a valiant warrior, snared and slain! For you I die, because your State is poor, And I was rich. For you, proud Senator, Whose haughty virtue frowns so stern upon Our work-day smutches, look to your own soul; For your death hour is nearâyour end may prove Viler than mine. Rien. Take them away! [Exeunt Pand. and Mont., guarded. (To Cits.) And now, Ye poor small fry of treachery, get you goneâ I have my eye upon you. To your homes, And see ye stir not, on your lives, abroad. [Exeunt Cits. driven out by Guards. The dying oft are prophetsâit may be My end is near. So my great work were done I cared not when it came; but end more vilely Than he? That's false; the manner of our death Makes not its baseness, or the cross would be Vile as the gibbet. But, till death, on, on! [Exit Scene III. âRome.âA Public Square. Enter Gianni Rosso, with Town Crier and Guards. Cecco del Vecchio and Citizens following them. Gianni R. Ring thy bell, crier. (Crier rings his bell; a crowd gradually assembles.) (Aside.) Who tells me that the trade of a politician is a bad trade? I have, indeed, been out in the cold long enough; but now I shall warm my nest. I begin to be known over the town as a snug man, a putter out of moneys at usury, and to be reverenced, withal, as a public functionary. (Aloud.) Ring thy bell, crier. (Crier rings again.) (Aside.) An officer of the revenue is no poor barber, at every man's beck and call; but a man in authority, and to be capped to and courted. Well, a few years more and I shall retire upon my gains, to enjoy the ripe remnants of my youth in scholar's leisure. (Aloud.) Now, crier, the proclamation. (Aside.) I'll note how they take it, and report to my nephew, the Senator. Crier (reads). Oyez! Oyez! Niccola di Rienzi, Senator of Rome, to the loyal citizens of the Roman Commonwealth greetingâ Cecco. Leave vain flourishes, man, and to the point. Crier. Whereas it hath been in the wisdom of the Roman Council determined (Hooting) to carry on the most just war against certain notorious bandits and wasters of the Commonwealth, to wit, Stefanello Colonna, calling himself a Roman Baronâ A Voice. Viva Stefanello Colonna! [Renewed hooting. Crier. And divers others, with him mischievously and seditiously conjoinedâ Cecco. They are not the only wasters of Rome. Crier. And whereas it hath become necessary to raise a special fund for the defence in the field of the iberties of Romeâ [Violent hooting. A Voice. Where is Fra Moreale's treasure? A Soldier. The soldiers have got none of it, anyhow. Crier. Now this is to proclaim that on and after this, the 8th day of October, in the year of grace one thousand three hundred and fifty-four, the ancient duty on salt and wine, known as the gabellaâ Tumultuous Cries. Down with the gabella! Down with all taxes! Death to the tyrant who has taxed us! Gianni R. Peace, good Romans! Peace, worthy citizens! Cecco. Death to all traitors and tax-gatherers! [He draws a dagger. Gianni R. O blessed saints, here's murder abroad! Guards, I say, guards, guards! Cecco. Kill them all, kill them! [The mob assault the Guards, who fling down their halberds and run. Exit Gianni Rosso and Crier, pursued by Cecco and others. Continued Tumult. Re-enter Cecco, etc. Cecco. The tyrant's knaves are dead, now for the tyrant himself. With this blood upon us, we must go on and make all sure, and that quickly. Voices. To the Capitol! To the Capitol! [Exeunt. Scene IV. âA Room in the Capitol. Enter Rienzi. Rien. I am still the fool of dreamsâI dreamed last night That I was Sisyphus in hell; I wake To find myself Rienzi, and in Rome. Rome is my rolling stone, that once with me Outsoared Jove's bird! What then? Rebels turned rulers Must blench not when the powers that set them high Come armed against them. Kings oft bear the blame Of Adam's ousting, and the flaw of the world; And mean show workers' deeds by gazers' dreams, Who plan short cuts to the clouds! This is the day When I proclaim the tax on salt and wine. If this be borneâ(Distant shouting.) What! answers this my thought? Ay, there must be some tumult, Rome being Rome. Secretary (entering hastily). Fly, fly, my lord! Rien. What means this outcry, friend? Sec. O fly, my lord, all Rome comes raging here! They rise, street after street, like handbreadth clouds That on the mountains, round a traveller's feet Gather for sudden tempest. [Shouting nearer. Rien. I'll not fly. How often have I faced these human waves, And stilled their roaring! I must stand this siege. Where are my guards? Sec. All gone, all false, all traitors! The captain of the watch has been subornedâ Pandolfo's son talked with him yesterday: They were sworn friends. Rien. O this is nightmare! Go, Fetch me my standardâquick! [Exit Secretary. O blunderer! Heaven Whips us, like schoolboys, for the slips we make, While our bold sins it winks at. Re-enter Secretay, with Standard. Give it me! And now, seek your own safety. Hence, begone! The postern to the Forum take, farewell! Sec. Alas! my lordâ [Shouting nearer. Rien. Away! (Exit Secretary.) They bay me close. All foes subdued but one, and that the worstâ The household foe whose hatred chills the sun, And leaves the world mere ruin. I have let loose The winds, to puff me back from Ithaca, The land in view, or in the harbour wreck me. Shouts without. Long live the Roman People! Death to the traitor who has taxed us! Death to the tyrant! Rien. Have patience, friends, awhileâI am not yet Dressed for my part. If die for you I must, Let me die decentlyâmy armour, so! [Putting on his armour. Cold hands denote hot thinkingâI have spoke best When most I trembled. Now, my helm and swordâ My gown of office. It may be my last Appearance on life's stage. Great banner, thou And I must stand or fall together. Shouts. Death to the traitor! Long live the Roman People! Rien. Come! For that's our cue. [Showing himself on the balcony. Long live the Roman people! so say I, With all my heart. Behold your standard-bearer, Whoâ Shouts. Let him not speak! Death to the tyrant! Death to the traitor! Rien. O Romans! friends! good friends! [Great tumult. Stones are flung and arrows shot at Rienzi, who is wounded in the hand. He retires. My thoughts sting worse than wounds. They will not hear me; Like a strong swimmer in tempestuous waves, I stifle in the surge. (He lays down the banner.) I have rehearsed Such scenes in thought; but to be hooted dumb! It angers me my mouth is gagged with noise, Which might have changed these yells of stupid hate To acclamation. I'll rush forth upon them, Armed as I am, and make my sword a scourge To write my rage on them in words of blood. [He casts off his robe, and draws his sword. And die like a mad dogâthe guilt upon me Of useless bloodshed? Maybe cast away Some last dear chance of life, for empty rage, A murderer and self-slaughtered? Let me think. [He lays aside his sword, and sits down. Die? must I die? (He laughs.) It feels as Death and I Were players in some sceneâthe devil, Death, And I, at dodge with him, the Prodigal. If with my blood from the brute powers of ill I bought one span of the world, I would kiss death; But yield the mellowing fruitage of my brain To blank abortionâtimeless rottenness, And leave in Rome mere chaos for my heir? I dare notâpettiest creatures love their lives, How should I cherish mine! [Renewed tumult. O God! is there no way to save myself, And my unborn great progeny of deeds From dreadful ending? I might pass disguised Even through their midst, jest in the popular tongue, And then, the Camp. I'll try it. Methinks I feel Their chance-aimed daggers groping for my heart, Fail I upon this hazard! O be bold! Had I as many wounds as CÃ¦sar had, I die but once. [Exit. Scene V. âBefore the Capitol.âOn one side a colossal lion, at the head of a descending staircase.âCecco del Vecchio, and a crowd of Citizens and Soldiers, with a spar of timber used as a battering-ram. Cecco. Now, all together! Heave! [They batter the door, which resists. Again! (Door still resists.) Once more! [Door still resists. 1st Soldier. Your ram is too weak; bring fire, and smoke him from his hole. Voices. Good, good! Bring fire! Bring torches! 1st Sol. And some dry hay and wood, with tar for a noble blaze. [Exeunt several. Cecco. Give him another volley, in the name of the Roman People. Let him dare to show his nose again. Cits. Deaths to the tyrant! [They fling stones. Enter Rienzi, disguised as a labourer, a bundle on his head. Rien. Up, comrades, by the secret stair! Up to the tyrant; and then to plunder, to plunder! [Exeunt Cecco and several Citizens. 2nd Sol. (to Rien.). What hast thou there? [Pulls down the bundle. 1st Cit. Lads, lads! This is himself! These are his braceletsâsee! [Pulls off his disguise. Rien. I am Rienzi, friendsâyour will with me? Cits. To the lion with him! To the lion! Others. Ay, ay, to the place of execution! Let him stand where he made many a poor fellow stand before! [They drag him to the lion. Rien. Alas! poor souls, ye know not what ye do. Stand back from me! (They fall back.) Let me but speak one word! Cits. No, not a word! One word, and thou diest! [A long pause, during which Rienzi looks round upon the crowd, who menace him at each attempt to speak. Re-enter Cecco and Citizens. Cecco. He is not there! Cits. He is hereâlook, man, where he stands! Cecco (having gazed awhile). 'Tis time we made an end of this. Death to the tyrant! [Draws dagger. Rien. What, Cecco, is it thou? Cecco. Not Cecco, tyrant, but the Roman People. Rien. Then here falls Rome, stabbed by the Roman People. Cecco. Death to the tyrant! [Stabs him. All. Death to the tyrant! [They close around, stabbing him. He falls and dies. CURTAIN.</field>
