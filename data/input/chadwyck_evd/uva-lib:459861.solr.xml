      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE Spoken by the Genius of England, holding a Trident in one hand and a Sword in the other. Is England's, Genius, that Victorious Name, Which shakes the World and fills the mouth of Fame, So much forgot, as you mispend your Witt (which my Great Deeds as Greatly might have Writt) To court a Fancy, or improve a Dreame, And seek new Worlds for a less noble Theame? Can you in Armes conspiring Nations see, And think on any thing but Fame, and Me? While the loud Cannon, with prophetick sound, Foretells our King must be in Paris crown'd, And with such Heat once more invade the French, As all the Waves between us cannot quench, To the just fury of whose Fatall Blowes Fleets, Walls, and Armies they in vaine oppose; This Trophy, which so gloriously to yours Add's a fourth Crown, and those four Crownes secures, The Belgian Admirall usurping bore, And I from him and all his Tritons tore He to another Element was blowne, Who thought himself Immortall in his owne; For still the Sea his Losses did Repair, Till our Alcides killd him in the Ayr. This Sword, which in French blood so often dyed Intail'd success on the young Edwards side, Resign'd to you shall all those Arts exceed Which made him Triumph and that Kingdome Bleed. Their frighted Lillies shall confess their loss, Wearing the Crimson livery of your Cross; And all the World shall learn by their Defeat, Our Charles, not theirs, deserves the name of Great.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST ACT. The first Scene is a magnificent Palace, King Edward the Third standing in the middle of the Theater, environ'd with his Nobility and Guards; the Lord Delaware presents the King a Letter which when he has read, the King sayes; King. Brave Delaware, my Son doth let me know How much my Empire to thy Sword does owe; What, generous Youth, could more thy Fame advance Then with thy hand to take King John of France. Dela. Sir, What you say, more Fame to me does yield Then I could gain in Poictiers glorious Field; For 'tis more honour to be prais'd by You Then 'tis another Monarch to subdue. King. No Subject winning Glory can admit Such Joy, as does his King rewarding it: The Chape of that Kings Sword whom thou didst take The Crest for ever of thy Armes shall make; In that addition to them shall be shown, While the World lasts, the honour thou hast won: To thee thy General leaves it to relate The English Glory and the Frenchmens Fate. Dela. As soon, Sir, as the Prince to Bourdeaux came (So much doth Glory his great Soul inflame) He took the Field, and did forthwith regain All that King John possess'd in Aquitaine; Then with like speed Anjou he did subdue, And all his Towns, but Poictiers, of Poitou; That place alone his Forces durst oppose. Guesclin the Gallantest of all our foes Poictiers did for their Governour admit, And he a while bravely defended it, Yet our Success was but a while deny'd, That by a greater it might be supply'd; For Heav'n decreed, that Poictiers, Sir, should yield As deathless Wreaths to you as Cressy Field; The noblest Wreaths which ever Victor wore Wreaths which shall last when Time shall be no more. King. But tell me how King John employ'd his time, While those three Provinces were torn from him. Dela. He, the mean while, rais'd all the Powers of France, And to relieve the City did advance. The Prince had notice of a strength so great, And timely might have made a fair retreat; Yet since before the place he once did lie, He was resolv'd to take it, or to die: From this resolve he could not, Sir, be won. King. He did therein, but what became my Son; No humane force could ever yet subdue An English Prince, and English Army too. Dela. The French appear, and Poictiers spacious plain Was not enough their Army to contain; Th'advantages of ground our General takes, And plants before his Squadrons sharp'ned Stakes; With the like Art, but yet in thicker Ranks, He strongly fortify'd his Rear and Flanks. The Word was giv'n, and all our Bows were bent, When a French Herauld to the Prince was sent, Who told him that his King had thought it good, To avoid the shedding of much Christian blood, To let him know he could not win the Field, And all should have fair quarter, would He yield: The Prince unmov'd did instantly reply, None does deserve to live who fears to die: Go tell your King, those English I command The name of Quarter hardly understand; But that, ere night, he may have cause to know, What we refuse to take we may bestow. King. This answer did the message well befit. Dela. The Herauld, Sir, return'd amaz'd at it, Their odds in number rais'd them to that height, They thought they came to take us, not to fight. King. How many were the French? Dela. âThemselves confess'd, That eighty Thousand men they were at least. King. What was my Son? Dela. âThe truth I do not wrong, Protesting he was but eight Thousand strong; But those eight Thousand, Sir, were English men. King. And One of those may well be reckon'd Ten. Dela. Sir, since your Army by your Son was led, We all did then believe what now you said; For in his eyes we our Success did see, His looks did ante-date our Victory. His face, that morning, to us all did show Those Lawrels, which that ev'ning Crown'd his Brow; Now all the Drums do beat, the Trumpets sound, The Soldiers shout the trembling Air does wound, The flying Arrows such thick clouds had made, As ev'n the heat of Fight produc'd a shade: Our Van brave Oxford and great Talbot lead, Whose Swords, that day, did much increase the Dead: Suffolk and Warwick did command our Rear, And there deserv'd those Titles which they bear; So did Audley, Sir, and Barkley too, Whom all did imitate but none outdo. King. The like at Cressy by those Six was done, Danger they slight where Glory may be won. Dela. Fortune, a while, did fear to ruine France, But when the Prince his battle did advance, He courted her with Valour so Sublime, As she turn'd just, and did declare for him; They in three Armies did divide their Pow'rs, And every one of them did treble ours; By which our Prince found, when the day was done, That he had fought Three battels to gain One: So many heaps of Frenchmen there were slain, As into Hills they seem'd to change the Plain; And all those Clouds, their Horses feet had made, Were with the Blood of their dead Riders laid: Two Lords arm'd like King John were in the Field, And by our Princes hand they both were kill'd; In doing which he did prodigious things, For though they were Not, yet they fought like Kings, While in the Field wars bloody Game was plaid, Guesclin did sally, and was Prisoner made. King. In your Relation you omit one thing I fain would hear, 'tis, how you took the King. Dela. Sir, In the heat of Battel 'twas my chance To fight with, and to take King John of France; 'Twas Fortune onely favour'd me in this. King. Your Modesty great as your Valour is, For here my Son to me at large does write The Honour which you purchas'd in the Fight. And all those brave Attempts which you did make, Before your Royal Prisoner you did take; Nothing which you perform'd from me is hid Dela. He writes what I'de have Done, not what I Did: When the French King into my pow'r did fall, I did conduct him to our General, Who then was giving of Rewards to those Who took two hundred Colours from your Foes; Amidst those Glorious Trophies, Sir, he stood, His Armour cover'd all with dust and blood; Those sights afresh the Captive King did wound. King. None in a Nobler Posture could be found. Dela. When to the Prince I nam'd King John of France, He hastily to meet him did advance, And to his Prisoner did as humbly bow, As, Sir, he could have done, had it been You. King. He did therein what did a Prince befit, Fierce in the Fight and Humble after it. Dela. The King then said, since Fortune does decree, I should be taken by my Enemy; Part of the wounds she gives, she also cures, Since now I fall into such hands as Yours; I am your Prisoner, Sir, and come to know The end you aim at by my being so, The Prince, in whom all Vertues do reside, Pitying the Kings misfortune, thus reply'd; That, mighty Prince, to which I most pretend Is, from an Enemy you'll turn a Friend: And if you'll grant what now is begg'd by me, I'le prize it more then this dayes Victory. These words the Prince with such an Accent grac'd, As by the King he closely was embrac'd, Who told him, in this Action you have shown, You have more ways to Conquer me then one, And, Sir, to prove this does my Mind subdue; That which you ask of Me I beg of You. King. This last Success transcends the other Three: 'Tis more to Gain then Beat an Enemy. Dela. All things to tell you too much time would take, But then so strict a Friendship they did make, As Our Prince vow'd he would sollicit you To grant the King a Peace and Freedom too; Then by a Liberality Sublime, He did that night at sopper wait on Him: By which that Vanquish'd Monarch well might boast, He there Receiv'd more Honour then he Lost. King. My Son in this did such High Worth express, As I more value It then his Success. Dela. The List of all those Pris'ners which we took Are by the Prince presented in this Book; [Gives the King a Book. All things secur'd which we had won by force, He with King John, for England steer'd his course. The wind so favour'd him, as yesterday He safely landed in Southampton-Bay, From whence he sent me Post to let you know They both tomorrow, Sir, will wait on you. King. For their Reception every thing prepare Which may your joys and your Respects declare. I'le treat this Royal Pris'ner at a rate Proportion'd to his Title, not his Fate. My Actions, not my Words, shall let you see, How much, brave Youth, You are esteem'd by Me. [Exeunt. The Scene is a Garden and a Grotta, in which Alizia Peirce lies as in a slumber. Enter Sevina, who playes upon the Lute, when she has done, Alizia rises, embraces her, and sayes; Aliz. Ah my dear Friend; it is in vain you strive To give that Ease which onely Death can give. Sev. This is the day you promis'd I should know That Fatal Sorrow under which You bow. I thought the Charms of Musick might abate The Grief which springs from what you will relate. Aliz. Too mean a thought you of my Grief admit, In thinking anything can Lessen it. Who would not all delights of Life decline That had a Soul so out of Tune as Mine? Sev. Do not from such a Friend your self refrain, My Help may put your Soul in Tune again: 'Tis to your Promise, Madam, that I trust, Let not your Sorrow make you prove Unjust. If Grief should make you to such Wrong submit, You will Deserve as well as Suffer it. Eliz. My Fatal Promise why do you pursue; Though Old Griefs, when related, turn to New, Yet you no longer shall of me complain, I'le rather Heighten then Deserve my Pain. You know, Dear Friend, when to this Court I came, My Eyes did all our bravest youths Inflame: And in that happy state I liv'd a while, When Fortune did betray me with a smile; Or rather Love against my Peace did fight; And, to revenge his Power which I did slight, Made Edward our Victorious Monarch be, One of those Many who did Sigh for Me. All other Flames but His I did deride, They rather made my Trouble than my Pride: But this, when told me, made me quickly know, Love is a God to which all Hearts must bow. Sev. 'Tis certain every Creature that hath Breath Is no more priviledg'd from Love than Death: Think you what is your Duty is your Crime, Or else do you repent you Conquer'd Him? Aliz. Oh had you heard, in what a moving way He the first time his Passion did display, And had you seen that Grief and matchless Grace Which did at once Cloud and Adorn his Face; You had admir'd such Differing Charmes to see, But more admir'd had they not Conquer'd Me. Sev. I was your Confident in that Bright Fire Which Both did in each others breast Inspire: A Fire might teach all Lovers how to Burn, Then sure 'tis something else which makes you Mourn. Aliz. Oh if he had been still to that Bright Flame As Faithful, and as Constant as I am; Justice her self, no Fire could higher prize, But that Blest Fire in which the Martyr Dies. But he is Falseâ Sev. âIf what you say were true, Madam, my Friendship must have seen it too; 'Tis Jealousie which has usurp'd Love's place. Aliz. Love has more piercing eyes then Friendship has; From the Suns sight you may the World remove, Sooner than hide from Lovers change in Love: His Glorious Flame for me in Clouds is set, And he Adores the fair Plantagenet; To that Bright Widow he his Heart does yield. Sev. Alas since her Brave Lord in France was kill'd, She onely doth the Pow'r of Grief obey. Aliz. How soon does Love wipe sorrows Tears away, Shee's Courted by a Monarch whose Renown Does make him greater much then does his Crown: To Conquer All he has resistless Pow'rs; His Sword subdues His Sex, his Vertues Ours. Sev. Then let his Virtue which you so much Prize Suppress your Jealousie and dry your Eyes; Virtue so Firm as nothing can Remove. Aliz. Virtue is nothing but a Name in Love, What cannot Love, when he is Victor, do? Which makes men think their Change their Virtue too. Sev. With equal Flames the King your Flames did meet, And daily breath'd his Passion at your feet: Myrtles, when giv'n by You, were Dearer held Than all those Lawrells Vanquish'd France did yield. He went with Grief that Empire to subdue, Hating what ever sever'd him from You. Aliz. I see his Change in spight of all his Art, He suffers not, but plays the Lovers part. Sev. Let not such Thoughts be entertain'd by you, He Courts you now more then he us'd to do. Aliz. This does the Truth of what I said detect, His Passion now is chang'd into Respect; And Love which once was High, and is decay'd, Like the Sun setting, casts the greater shade. From all his sacred Vows he does depart, 'Tis False Love onely needs the help of Art. Sev. Such Doubts his Constancy may Over-throw, Who Thinks him False provokes him to Be so; Did you to him your cause of Grief unfold? Aliz. 'Twould not deserve that Name, could it be told; She meanly Loves who slighted can admit, Ought but her death should tell her Lover. Sev. No wonder Grief thus in your Breast does Reign, When you from your Physician hide your Pain; Let Him but hear from whence your Sorrow grows. Aliz. 'Tis lowe, and vain to tell him what he knows. Sev. Then I will tell it him, and he will fly Faster to You, than to a Victory; And quickly learn to clear his Fancy'd Fault. Aliz. A Perfect Lover needs not to be taught, And if he were with Loves true Passion Fir'd, He would not need to Learn, hee'd be Inspir'd. Sev. At my request ease your distemper'd Mind, And on my life you suddenly shall find, To think him faulty is to think Amiss. Aliz. He is too Guilty, since I think he is. [Exeunt several wayes. Enter Cleorin and Delaware. Cleo. I hop'd your absence (now three years compleat) Had cur'd your Passion for Plantagenet, And you would Fame to hopeless Love prefer. Dela. I courted Fame but more to merit Her, Since I durst Love, not having Fame atchiev'd, Since I Ador'd her while her Husband liv'd, Now that the Noble Kent three years is dead, Now that with Lawrel War has Crown'd my Head, How can you be, dear Sister, so unwise, To think that Love can fall while Hope does rise? Cleo. You know, Dear Brother, onely for your sake That I three years incessant care did take, To make my self your Conquerours Confident; But though I have accomplish'd my Intent, Yet all I Gain'd by it, is to believe She never your Addresses will Receive; For since she lost her Lord the Noble Kent, She thinks all time not paid to Grief mispent. Dela. In what you say much cause of Hope I find, Since Grief th'unwelcom'st Passion of the Mind She does admit within her to Reside, Love the most welcome cannot be Deny'd. Cleo. Do not your Hopes with such wild Fancies feed, Her's is a Grief which does from Love proceed; You by your Passion strangely are mis-led. Dela Is it then possible to Love the Dead? We but to those Alive can Love express, For when the Cause does die, the Effect must cease. Cleo. Your own strange Fate opposes what you said, Your Love does Live and yet your hope is Dead. Dela. Since Love has over her Triumphant been, My Flame is such, to doubt Success were Sin. Cleo. Nothing from Sorrow can her Soul remove, And Grief is still an Enemy to Love; But were her Grief subdu'd, yet I must say A greater hind'rance does obstruct your way; In the King's Heart a growing Flame does rise, Which he discovers by his Sighs and Eyes; He is the greatest Monarch of the Earth, And greater by his Actions then his Birth. Dela. Had I her heart, his Titles would not sway, In Loves just ballance onely Love does weigh. Cleo. The Nature of our Sex I'le not disguise, Our Servants Loves less than their Pow'rs we prise; For but in Name alone their Hearts are ours, But we effectually do share their Pow'rs. Dela. Yet Love would tell her, 'tis a greater thing To Conquer, then it is to be a King. Cleo. There's something else which makes my Care more great Then all which I to you have mention'd yet, You know the Prince of Wales did once appear Your Conquerours Lover, and was lov'd by her, And he to wed her gain'd the Kings Consent; But unexpectedly she married Kent: I often prest the Cause she would reveal, Yet she the secret does from me conceal; But though she on the Prince does lay the Blame Yet she will weep when she but hears his Name. A thousand other Proofs do make me doubt That Fire is onely cover'd not put out. Dela. Ah Cleorin, there's none but I alive Of that Strange Marriage an account can give: You know when to the Wars of France I went I made a Friendship with the Earl of Kent, Which in short time did grow so strong and high, As when he found he of his Wounds should die, He to strict silence first did me Engage, Then told me how he gain'd his Marriage, Which is so strange a story, I dare swear She never can love him, nor he love her. Cleo. I will not beg you then to tell me why, Since you have ty'd your self to secresie: Brother, I now must leave you, for you know Our King does on King John a Masque bestow, To which he did Plantagenet invite, And thither I must wait on her to night. Dela. Ah since you must be gone, yet e're you go Let me at least what I may hope for know. Cleo. The highest joy to which you can pretend, Is, that your Mistress you may make your Friend. Dela. If She does Friendship and not Love bestow, At once she'll make me blest, and wretched too. Cleo. She'll meet your Friendship, but your Love she'll shun; Despair must do what Reason should have done. Dela. This is a cruelty she should abhorre, She should not do so much, or should do more. [Exeunt several wayes. Enter the King, Alizia, and Sevina. Alizia's Chamber. King. While your Suspition to such height does rise, You wrong at once my Passion and your Eyes: Ah Madam, be no longer so unkind, Since you to think me False must think me Blind; How can you doubt of any change in me, When such fair Eyes are your Security. Aliz. Ah do not, Sir, condemn what I have done, To doubt your Love does more declare my own: 'Tis Love, not Jealousie which I detect, Then for the causes sake excuse th'effect. King. Madam, there is but one degree you know 'Twixt doubting I am false and thinking so. Aliz. To you no clearer Proof, Sir, I can give I think you are not false, then that I live; For did I doubt you guilty of that wrong My death should tell it you, and not my tongue. King. The pow'r of Kindness, Madam, you confound, Making your Love the Sword with which you wound; If from this day my Ruine you will date, Then by some other Weapon act my fate; Your Anger Misery enough does prove Without ascribing of it to your Love. 'Twere better far I fell by your Disdain Then have your Love my blessing turn my Pain. Aliz. What I have said too warmly you pursue. King. How can you love him whom you think untrue? Admire not what you said so much does move, Since if you think me false I lose your love; Against such groundless Fear there's no defence. Aliz. Love feels no greater Torment then Suspense, Since she who truly Loves had rather know Her Lover false, than always think him so; For 'tis an ill more sensible and high To Live tormented still, then 'tis to Die: But you may end those Torments I deplore, If you will never see my Rival more. King. This is a Remedy severe and new, Rudeness to her must Kindness be to you; And of my Love can you no proof admit But what will make me for your Love unfit? Aliz. Ah were I Blest or Curst to such degree As that you thought some other lov'd by Me, I would for ever from his sight be gone And would in your contentment find my own; Were your Affections but for me as great Then you no more would see Plantagenet. King. She is the nearest Kinswoman I have, Her Lord too in my Service found his Grave; Nature and Honour these respects approve And make that Duty which you doubt is Love. Aliz. Alas were you not chang'd, you would not be Civil to her, rather than kind to me. King. Will this your Fatal Jealousie remove? I swear I never spake to her of Love. Aliz. Love is not alwayes by Discourse made known, It may be spoken in a Look or Groan; Some in those wayes more Passion can dispense Then others by the Charms of Eloquence; Your Oath I fear is dictated by Art, Your Tongue is innocent, but not your Heart. King. This, Madam, too much your unkindness shows, You neither will believe my Love nor Vows. Aliz. Do not admire my Doubts and Fears are high When you that easie cure of them deny; I saw you gaze on her, much more then you Did gaze on me when I did know you true; Which to my Torment, Sir, does let me see You lov'd Me not, or lov'd Her more then Me; Man's Art to such a height could never rise As love from a true Lover to disguise; Oh Sir, it is high time I let you know Though Love is blind, yet Lovers are not so. King. He never yet the height of Love has known Who onely told it in a Look or Groan; When I to you that Passion did express Which, Madam, onely with my Life shall cease: Though many Looks and Sighs to you I sent, Yet by Discourse too I did give it vent; If through all passages it does not press, It soon will kill the heart it does possess: Love is so vast a Passion, as the breast Is much too small to hold so great a Guest. Aliz. Great Love is like great Grief, and all, Sir, hold That Grief is weak or small which can be told. Enter Lord Latymer, who whispers to the King. King. Madam, A pressing business calls me now, Be therefore satisfied with this strict Vow; My carriage to Plantagenet shall be Such as shall make you grant you've injur'd me. [Exeunt King and Lord Latymer. Aliz. Now my Sevina, think you not that I Had a sufficient ground for Jealousie. Sev. Madam you had, but give me leave to say You to suppress it took a hopeless way. Aliz. To what way else could I have had recourse. Sev. A Lover never was brought back by force; But since he raises Jealousie in you, Madam, resolve to make him Jealous too: You by a double Right must gain his Heart, First owe it to your Beauty, then your Art: Love is like Health which all men value most, Not while it is possest, but when 'tis lost. Aliz. I'le rather bear Misfortunes worst Assault Then owe my blessing to a seeming Fault; If what you now propose I should approve, Virtue would blush at my Success in Love; Honour alone shall guide my Actions still, Rather than I will do, I'le suffer Ill: My Rival nor the King shall ever say To gain my Right I took a guilty way; She has the Happier, I the Nobler part, She may Possess, but I'le Deserve his Heart. Exeunt. The end of the first Act. The Curtain fals.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND ACT. The First Scene. The Curtain being drawn up, King Edward the Third, King John of France, and the Prince of Wales appear, seated on one side of the Theater; waited on by the Count of Guesclin, the Lord Latymer, the Lord Delaware, and other Lords, with the King's Guards. On the other side of the Theater are seated Plantagenet, Alizia, Cleorin, Sevina, and other Ladies. The Scene opens; two Scenes of Clouds appear, the one within the other; in the hollow of each Cloud are Women and men richly apparell'd, who sing in Dialogue and Chorus, as the Clouds descend to the Stage; then the Women and Men enter upon the Theater, and dance; afterwards return into the Clouds, which insensibly rise, all of them singing until the Clouds are ascended to their full height; then onely the Scene of the Kings magnificent Palace does appear, all the Company arise. King Ed. Since you are Pris'ner by the fate of War, I shall not onely make it, Sir, my Care Your Grief by such diversions to allay, But quickly too to take their Cause away; Two pow'rful Motives me to this perswade, The Friendship, Sir, you with my Son have made, And that rare Fortitude which you have shown In Poictiers Field, and after it was won. King Jo. Sir, Of that Fatal place I'le not complain, Since I in it his Friendship did obtain, Which I so prize as I'de the loss repeat Rather then miss a happiness so great. Embracing the Prince. Prince. As much as Virtue Fortune does out-shine, So much your Victory surpasses mine; A treaty will my bonds on you untie, But yours on me will last eternally. King Ed. That Treaty we to morrow will begin, And you shall find I'le so proceed therein, As you and all the world, Sir, shall confess Justice shall guide me in it, not Success: Doubt not but what I promise shall be done, Tis what I ow my Honour and my Son. King Jo. Thus using your Success, the world will see How justly you deserve your Victory; Force in rough Fetters may the Body bind, But onely Friendship Captivates the Mind. King Ed. It is already, Sir, so late I fear As I no longer will detain you here; But onely for the Ladies sake to ask If you have been delighted with their Mask. King Jo. While they are here, a Sin I should esteem My being pleas'd with any thing but them; To such a height their conquering Beauties rise, T'admire them onely I employ'd my Eyes. King Ed. All those who treat of Love are much abus'd, If Love be dangerous while 'tis diffus'd; To morrow they attend you at the Ball, Then 'twill perhaps on one contracted fall. King Jo. 'Tis harder, Sir, as 'tis by tryall known, To resist many then resist but one; But much more hard when each of them I see Has Charms enough alone to conquer me. [Exeunt King John leading out Plantagenet. As all are going out Alizia stops Sevina, who both return on the Theater. Aliz. Stay my Sevina, 'ere from hence you go I must your Heart as you my Heart shall know; Me thought I saw King Edward by Surprize Look on my Rivall with a Lovers Eyes; If while I'me present he does her Adore, Ah when I'me absent sure he does it more. Sev. Through a false Optick, Madam, still we look, When Jealousie hath once possession took; I mark'd the King, and if His Looks were true He with Loves eyes did onely look on you: But I am sure the Princes Eyes were set With so much Passion on Plantagenet, As all my Skill in Looks I think is vain, If his old Wound bleeds not afresh again; Aud I'le ne're trust a Womans Eyes if She Be not as sick of that Disease as He. Aliz. I am amaz'd at what I hear from you. Sev. Madam, You'll find what I have said is true, And if the Prince and Shee each other Love The Kings Addresses will Successless prove. Should his imagin'd Passion be as high As you can think taught thought by Jealousie, This, Madam, ought your Trouble to suppress. Aliz. It does increase rather then make it less, Ah what Delight or Glory will it be, To find her Scorn does drive him back to me; May she still rather of her Conquest boast, Then I regain so meanly what I lost: My Lover to my Rival I will loose, Sooner then Take a King she does Refuse. Then do not think I'le do so Low a thing: I'le Nobly Loose or Nobly Keep the King. Sev. My hopes of Serving you I must forsake, When you a Poison of your Cordial make. Aliz. What greater curse in Love can Fortune send Then make the way unworthy to the end? For should He from my Rivall now refrain, I must attribute it to her Disdain: I by my doubt did but the Pain endure, But what you said cuts off all Hope of Cure. [Exeunt. The Scene is Plantagenets Chamber. Plantagenet and Cleorin. Cleo. Pray speak your thoughts since I have told you mine. Plan. Alas dear Friend, they are the same with thine; But to be us'd by Him as I have been Does make me blush at Love as at a Sin. Cleo. I oft have beg'd you, Madam, but in vain, To tell me why you of the Prince complain. Plan. 'Tis that alone from thee I can conceal, Nay I that Secret would to thee reveal, Had I not Lov'd the Prince to such degree, As I had rather be Condemn'd then he: Ah what can my Respect more clearly show, Then willingly his Guilt to undergo. Cleo. I cannot think a Prince of such high Fame, As all the World does homage to his Name, To such a horrid Crime can condescend; As is unfit for you to tell your Friend. Plan. To those bright Stars which guide us 'tis a shame, That so much Falshood dwells with so much Flame. Cleo. Heaven seldom does that man with Lawrels Crown Who ought by Thunder to be strucken down, And Crimes which you to me dare not relate Cannot but Merit, Madam, such a Fate: I doubt you are betray'd by some abuse. Plan. Oh that his Sin would but admit Excuse; Which that it cannot doubtless you'll admit, When I have vow'd, 'twas he which told me it. Cleo. Madam, You might his words mis-understand. Plan. Alas he writ them me with his own Hand. Cleo. Oh in what Throne can Sacred Vertue Reign. When Such a Prince does Falshood entertain. Plan. I know not which for wonder is more fit, Th'Offence he did or my out-living it; But though no usage ever was so ill, Yet, Cleorin, I fear I Love him still; For when I saw him at the Mask to night, From him I could not take away my sight; Blushes and Sighs each other did pursue, Too certain Signs that what I Fear is True; But I'le no more this guilty talke prolong, Who can the Offender Love, deserves the Wrong. [Exeunt. Enter King John of France, and Count Guesclin. Guesc. Since all things, Sir, to ease your Grief are done By the Great Edward and his Greater Son, Why shew you now more Sorrow in your Look Then when at Poictiers you were Pris'ner took. King Jo. Ah who could think more could by Fate be done, Then rob me of my Freedom and my Crown. Guesc. You did unworthy of your Fate appear, So bravely, Sir, those Losses you did bear. Your Conquerour, for a constancy so high, Applauded You, and blam'd your Destiny. Heav'n did to you your Miseries assign, Onely to make your Vertues brighter shine. King. Over my Sorrows I could still command, Were I but Fortunes malice to withstand; She could my Hands but as a Pris'ner bind, But now I am a Captive of the Mind; At Poictiers I by Force did lose the Field But here alas I willingly do Yield. Gues. I cannot, Sir, believe so ill of you As that you blame what willingly you do. How can you bear the worst of Fortunes blows, Yet sink with what you on your self impose. King. This Generous Prince doubly does me subdue, By force of Armes, and force of Friendship too. I must lament what he hath done for me, Since now 'tis Sin to hate my Enemy. Guesc. Blame not your Fortune, but your self Commend, For making a Brave Foe a Braver Friend. King. He by my Ruine makes his Glory rise, Then me by Friendship from Revenge he ties, Oh do not blame me if I feel Remorse, When I'me subdu'd by Kindness as by Force. Guesc. Your Friendship for him, Sir, was never sound, If such effects of it your Soul does wound; Ah let him never, Sir, my King subdue Both by his Fortune and his Vertue too. Your Honour is so Firm and so sublime, 'Twere Sin to think you Guilty of that Crime: 'Tis something else which does your Grief Inspire, After what you would hide I'le not inquire. King. Ah Friend, I grant 'tis something else indeed, Yet from his Friendship does my Grief proceed, For at the Mask King Edward made for me The Bright Plantagenet I there did see, And soon my Heart a Passion did admit Vast as those Beauties which created it: Such Features, Colours, Motions, and such Eyes, With the Result which from them all did rise, My Soul to this belief did quickly win, That Yielding Duty was, Resistance Sin. Guesc. Your Grief from Love not Friendship then does grow. King. It springs at once from Love and Friendship too: For I observ'd, during the masking Night, The Prince on her did alwayes fix his Sight, And often from his breast a Sigh wold steal Which as his Looks his Passion did reveal; But that which made my Trouble much more great Was, when her Sight did with the Prince's meet: A bright Vermillion in her Face would rise, Then with a Sigh she would cast down her Eyes; What stronger Prooff could either of them show, That he lov'd her, and that she Lov'd him too: Condemn not then my Grief who must contend, Both with my Conquerour, and with my Friend. Guesc. Let that which does your Grief your Glory prove, Making your Friendship overcome your Love; 'Twill be by all a Greater Action held, Thus to Decline a Love then Gain a Field; As much as Vertue above Fortune is So much your Glory will out-rival his; For you a Nobler Conquest this secures, Let Force his Triumph make, but Friendship yours. King. Guesclin, Such talk as this you must forbear, The greatest Glory is her Chains to wear; In what thou mov'st, thou dost mispend thy breath, None cures her Beauties Wounds but She or Death. Guesc. 'Tis strange to be so Vanquish'd the first hour. King. That does not show my Weakness but her Pow'r. Her Beauty onely has the Right and Art, At the first Sight to Captivate a Heart; Her Eyes can be no more oppos'd then Fate, Others may Raise, but she does Love Create. Guesc. I once believ'd the Empire of your Breast Could onely by Valeria be possest. King. I was my self to that belief confin'd, But now Plantagenet has chang'd my Mind; She claim'd my Heart in such a Charming way, That to Refuse was worse then to Obey; Guesclin, She gives, as to my cost I prove, New Rules in Beauty, and new Laws in Love. Guesc. This sudden change I cannot, Sir, but dread, The News of it will strike Valeria dead. King. Who on my Conquerours Beauty does reflect, Will find the Cause does justifie th'Effect. Guesc. But why have you your Heart so soon resign'd To Outward Beauties, till you knew the Mind. King. Ah when the Mask was done, I quickly found Her Mind was like her Eyes with Brightness Crown'd; Such heightned Wit did in her Words appear, As she subdu'd my Heart too by my Ear: 'Twas vain alas to think of a Defence, When she had Charm'd my Soul in every Sence; Then do not hope my Passion to remove, But as thou art my Friend assist my Love. Guesc. Though I foresee this Passion many wayes Will to your Fame and Freedom Trouble raise, And that the Prince's Love obstructs your way, Yet, Sir, since you Command me I Obey; I'le make it, Sir, my business now to win Your Conquerours Confident fair Cleorin: To Lovers, Sir, the Favorite Women are; The same as Outworks to a Town of War; Though to the Town compar'd but small they look, Yet those once gain'd, the Place is sooner took. King. Go my dear Guesclin then, and quickly try, If Friendships Wings as fast as Loves can Fly. [Exeunt several wayes. The Scene is the Prince's Chamber. The Prince and Delaware. Prince. Oh Delaware, mine is so strange a Grief, As I nor Hope nor Wish to have Relief. Dela. May you not to your Servant, Sir, declare That Grief in which he begs to have a share? Pr. Ah why should I that Grief to you impart, Whose Trouble for it will more Wound my Heart; With my own Sorrows I can scarce contend, Adde not to these the Sorrows of my Friend. Dela. Since you to me so high a Title give, I humbly beg you by it to believe Nothing to you so Great a Grief can be As this denial, Sir, would prove to me; I, Sir, your Friendship Treats me at this rate, 'Twill make your Kindness wound me like your Hate. Should I want Pow'r to make your Grief decline, I'le not increase it by disclosing mine. Pr. That deep Affliction under which I Groan Cannot alas be eas'd by being known; Yet since no proof you'll of my Friendship take, But what your trouble and my own must make, Rather then you should fear the Truth of it, I to that proof which you desire submit; I doubt not you have heard how heretofore The Fair Plantagenet I did Adore, And that I had some ground to think that she Nor Cruel nor Ungratefull was to me; Heav'n knows I Lov'd her with so chaste a Flame As I to Marry her did onely aim, To which at last my Father did consent, When she next day but one did marry Kent; And which is worse, if worse then this can be, She for it n'ere excus'd her self to me. Dela. To offer at it had increas'd th'abuse, Who could excuse a fault above excuse? Pr. I who through all Wars dangers oft have past, I who a thousand times have Death out-fac'd, In all those Horrors did less Trouble see, Then in Plantagenets inconstancy. Dela. 'Tis she, not you, which should her Change repent, Since in her Sin she found her Punishment. Pr. Alas to me a sad Revenge it prov'd, To see her Ruin'd whom so much I Lov'd: What worse to me could She or Fortune do, Then make her Punishment my Torment too; A Torment which all others did out-do, Since I who felt it cannot tell it you; But yet at last Honour prevail'd so far, As I forsook Plantagenet for War; Hoping in War by Death to find Relief, Or else in time to weare away my Grief. Dela. In her Inconstancy and in that War, Heav'n shew'd it took of you a double Care; With deathless Lawrels you have Crown'd your Head, And must a Wife unworthy of your Bed. Pr. How dare you talk of her at such a rate, For though her Usage might deserve my Hate, Yet from her Eyes such conquering Light does break, As none of her but with Respect should speak. Dela. Forgive me if the sence, Sir, of your Wrong Did force a Guilty Duty from my Tongue. Pr. To her alone that suit you must prefer, I dare not pardon an Offence to Her, The Wrong I told thee of concerns not Thee. Dela. Yes she in Wronging you has injur'd me. Prince. From such Discourse I charge you to refrain; Be taught by me t'Endure and not Complain; If what I said thou dost so much deplore, What I must say I find will grieve thee more; For know she does again my Conquerour prove; [Dela. starts. I thought her Change had cur'd my Injur'd Love; But when last night I saw her Beauties Shine, Resentment did to Love the Throne resign; And that deep Wound clos'd up by her Disdain Was open'd by one Conquering Look again; As when the Murth'rer does the Murder'd see, The Corps will bleed a-fresh immediately. Dela. Oh let it never of my Prince be said, He yields to one by whom he was Betray'd! Pr. I glory more my Love that Wrong o'recame, Then I can Grieve that I so Injur'd am; What to my Flame a Remedy can grant, When her Inconstancy that Power does want? I find, do what she will, in me she'll Reign. Her Eyes give deeper Wounds then her Disdain. Dela. What her Disdain did want the Power to do, Let Honours Dictates now perswade you to: And, Sir, to arm you for this just Assault, Know she has said her Mariage was your Fault: Ah 'twas enough the Injury to do, Without attributing the Guilt to You. Malice it self at nothing worse could aim, She kills your Love and then would kill your Fame. And, Sir, to shew her Fault all Faults surpass, She of the First makes use to act the Last. Pr. Ah do not think this can my Love subdue, Since what she charg'd me with I wish were True: I at my Miseries would scarce repine, Had I the Pow'r to make her Failings mine. My Love for her would make me be content, To have her Guilt and my own Punishment; Yet I have nam'd but half the Weight I bear: My Father is in Love with her I hear; And I am much mistaken if last Night, She the French King Subdu'd not at first Sight; By which I find I must the Field maintain, Against my King, my Friend, and her Disdain. But though worse Crosses should my Hopes befall, My pow'rfull Love would Overcome them all. Disswade me not, but try for me to win The Friendship of thy Sister Cleorin; She most of all my Conquerours mind does sway, Reply not if thou Lov'st Me, but Obey. [Exit Prince. Delaware alone. Dela. Some Fatal Planet at my Birth did Reign, Since all things which should Cure, Augment my pain; My Sister who at last for me did get To be the Favorite to Plantagenet, Which from Despair till now my Soul did free; My Prince makes use of now to ruine me; My Love he aims not onely to destroy, But to obtain that End does Me employ. Not doing it I Disobedience show, And if I do it, I my Love o'rethrow: That Secret, dying Kent reveal'd to me, Which rais'd my Hopes, now makes my Misery. My Mistress I betray while 'tis conceal'd, And should betray my Love were it reveal'd; What ever happens I must Wretched prove, For I must Lose, or not Deserve her Love. Thus from Wars Dangers Crown'd with Bayes I rise, Onely to fall the greater Sacrifice; Yet of a Remedy I will not doubt, Love which has Led me in may Lead me out. [Exeunt. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE THIRD ACT. The Scene is King John's Apartment. Enter King John, and a Page. Page. The fair Valeria has her Brother sent T'attend you, Sir, in your imprisonment; His Sister from the Duke of Lancaster Obtain'd a Pass which brought him safely here; He is but newly lighted at your Gate And begs your leave that he on you may wait. King. Valeria's Brother sure it cannot be. Page. Sir, I but say the words he said to me. King. Which of her Brothers is't? Page. âThat Brother, Sir; Who, e're his face was hurt; resembled her. King. Call himâ Exit Page. How can I on the Brother look, Whose Sister is by me so soon forsook? But who the Bright Plantagenet shall see, Must be unjust or else must pardon me. Enter the Page with Valeria's Brother, whom the King embraces. King. You are so like your Sister, I should know You were her Brother though none told me so: She may increase my Debt as she thinks sit, But nothing can the Sence I have of it. The Battel I have lost I hope that She Ascribes to my Ill Fate, and not to Me; Fortune alas too Tyrannous would prove, If what has lost my Crown should lose her Love. Val. Bro. Since for your Mistress you of her made Choice, She at the loss, Sir, does almost rejoyce; For it presents her with a proof that shows, Her Love is past the reach of Fortunes Blows. She'll grieve at nothing your ill Fate can do, Unless at that which fevers her from you. King. Never Affection to this height did rise, It proves her Love is matchless as her Eyes; And makes me scarce repine at what I bear, Since it does shew how I am lov'd by her. Val. Bro. She of her Love a higher Proof does show, In what she has commanded me to do; For, Sir, she knows that England still affords Beauties, which are Resistless as her Swords, And has enjoyn'd me if you here should be In Love with any one more Fair then She, I should assist you, Sir, in your Amours, And Sink her Happiness, to Heighten yours. King. She does at once in what she bid you do Declare her Love, and run no hazard too; For he, who once is made Valeria's prize, Is arm'd against all Wounds from others Eyes. Enter Guesclin. The King goes hastily to meet him to the other side of the Theater: Valeria's Brother list'ning to them. 'Tis with impatience, Guesclin, I have staid To learn from you the Progress you have made. Guesc. In vain I try by Presents, Sir, to win The Assistance of the Beauteous Cleorin; She, as I'me told, was preingag'd before. King. Whoever told you that could tell you more. Guesc. By Gifts I won a Lady who of late The Honour on your Mistress had to wait, Who told me and assur'd me it was true, The Prince of Wales does love your Mistress too. King In this my Cruel Fate on me does send The greatest curse which I could apprehend, Must I the Prince or else my Fortune blame, Who thus does rival me in Love and Fame? Guesc. How can you justly, Sir, this News deplore Since I but tell you what you thought before. 'Tis the least Wonder does in Love befall, To think a Mistress is Ador'd by all. I as a Lover to that Thought was bound, But now that Thought a Certainty is found, Which justly in my Soul does grief infuse. Guesc. She has acquainted me with stranger News, She told me, Sir, this is the second time, The Bright Plantagenet was lov'd by him. He by Despair to the French Wars was sent, She leaving him to wed the Earl of Kent, But she the cause of it could not relate. King. How strange and intricate a Pow'r is Fate, The Prince of Wales finds in a slighted Flame The Noblest of all wayes to raise his Fame; Glory does heal what Love made him endure, And his Dispair presents him with his Cure. He mist her Love a while, that he might be More worthy of it by his Conquering Me; A happy Planet at his Birth did Reign; A seeming Loss brings him a double Gain; While Fate with me so cruelly does act, As by one Loss a greater I contract, Successless Love his way to Fame does prove, And loss of Fame does make my way to Love. Guesc. You wrong your Vertue by this strange Debate; The Brave are still the makers of their Fate; 'Tis onely, Sir, those men whose Souls are low, Which first made Fate and then to Fate did bow. Nor War nor Love, Sir, are Resistless Powers, Both have their Happy as Unhappy Hours; But he who does for one Mischance Dispair, Can ne're be prosperous in Love or War. As I have told you what has rais'd your Grief, So now I will present you some Relief; For my informer, Sir, to me has swore, That though the Prince your Mistress does Adore, He hath not yet his Love to her disclos'd, She therefore, Sir, has hopefully propos'd. That you this moment to the Prince would go And let him from your self this Passion know; His Friendship for you and so great a Trust Will make him cease to Love or be Unjust; If, Sir, he does the first, your End you win, And by the last make Rivalship no Sin: This, Sir, which She Proposes I approve. King. No Friendship ever yet could conquer Love, He to that Passion vainly does pretend Who can resign his Mistris to his Friend; I scarce can relish what she does advise, It seems to me nor Generous, nor Wise, For in vain hopes of what it ne're will do I clearer shall the lesser Friendship show; My Friendship too were guilty of a Crime Should his do more for me then mine for him. Guesc. But e're her Council, Sir, you Disapprove, Consider if you can forsake your Love. King. Sooner then I my Passion will forgo I will forsake my Crown and Friendship too. Guesc. Then pray, Sir, follow what she does Advise, And you will find 'tis Generous and wise; If to the Prince you first your Passion own You first do that which he first should have done, And lay that Blame on him while this you do; Which justly else he might have charg'd on you: Since you will Court the Mistress of your Friend This is the fairest way to reach your End. King. I will approve that which you last did say, And to attempt it will no time delay. [Exeunt King, Guesclin and Page. Val. Bro. In which of both does he not Guilty prove, In his Dissembling, or his change of Love? There is but one way left that I can see To Cure or Punish his Inconstancy.â Exit. Enter Plantagenet and Cleorin. Cleo. Guesclin did shew no little Discontent When I refus'd the Gifts his King had sent, Who since this way he does Successless prove He will himself declare to you his Love; And, Madam, I believe King Edward too Will suddenly disclose his Flame to you. Plan. Oh Cleorin how cruel is my Fate That those should Love me most whom most I Hate, And he whom most I love, spight of his Fault, I fear of me scarce does admit a Thought Enter to them Alizia and Sevina. Aliz. Excuse me, Madam, if I take this time T'accuse your Beauty of a seeming Crime: That Friendship which on me you did bestow Does make it just I should yet call it so. Plan. Madam, I am Surpriz'd at what you say, For that great Friendship which to you I pay, Does make me confident I ne're could do What may be call'd a seeming Crime by you. Let me but know my Charge, and you will see You are more Faulty in Suspecting me. Aliz. From the first hour in which you did descend To bless me with the Title of your Friend, I so much valu'd it as Heaven does know I strove to Merit what you did bestow, Which makes what e're I did in serving you To be at once my Joy and Duty too. And though your Goodness often would confess I serv'd you above all you could express, Yet I was higher Griev'd I did no more, Then I was Pleas'd with all I did before. Plan. Madam, to prove my Debt you need not strive, I'le own my self the ungratefull'st Soul alive, If since our Friendship I did e're admit A thought which might but seem unfit for it. Aliz. Ah, Madam, can you say what now you do, And have your Face exempt from blushes too? Or do you think it is a Friendly thing To rob me of my Lover and my King? One, who till now preserv'd so pure a Flame As made hime greater for his Love then Fame, If this be held a Friendly Act by you, Pursue such friendly Acts, and Kill me too; To me a much less Cruelty 'twould prove To rob me of my Life, than of my Love; For our past Friendships sake you shou'd not give Wounds worse than Death, and after let me live: Your Cruelty grants half of my Request, Then let your Pity, Madam, grant the rest: Accept this Weapon, and no longer shun To let your Hand cure what your Eyes have done. Presenting her a Dagger. Plan. I am amaz'd at what you say and do, I'le sooner wound my self with it than you. Aliz Ah, 'tis your kindness to the King I see Hinders your granting what is beg'd by me; His Image, Madam, you but love too well, You fear to strike the Shrine where it does dwell; But for that Reason what I ask dispence, Since onely Death can banish it from thence; Else to you Conquest 'twill some trouble give To know he in your Rivals heart does live. Plan. Can you believe I'll share that Monarcks Bed By whose Command my Father lost his Head? My Father who was Unkle too to him, And who in Virtue to such height did climb, As a whole day he on the Scaffold stood, E're they could find out one would shed his Blood; King Edwards double Guilt my soul does fright, First he usurp'd on his own Fathers right, Then stain'd a Scaffold with his Unkles gore For striving his wrong'd Brother to restore. Aliz. You should not charge your Fathers death on him, Since 'twas his Pow'r, not he, which did that Crime; His Councellors, while he was under age, Cloath'd with his name th'injustice of their rage; For which when he had reach'd his Fourteenth year, He put to death the Guilty Mortimer, And to appease you for that Murtherers Sin He now does Court you to become his Queen. Plan. I thought from Nature you had understood There's no Atonement for a Fathers Blood: Then do not think I'le ever Condescend At once to injure Nature and my Friend. Aliz. Have you forgot how you were almost won, Madam, to wed your Father's Murth'rers Son? If onely Love prevail'd so far with you, What cannot Love, and thirst of Empire do. Plan. Into a high Injustice I had run Had I ascrib'd the Kings guilt to his Son. Aliz. You with a worse Injustice can dispence, You charge the King with Mortimers Offence; A Fathers Guilt a Son may undergo, But Kings partake not Sins which Subjects do. Plan. If on the Prince his Birth a Guilt did lay, He with his Tears did wash that Guilt away. Aliz. The Princes Grief was Weak, the Kings was Strong, The Prince Deplor'd, the King Reveng'd your Wrong; The King did more if rightly understood, The Son gave you but Tears, the Father Blood. Plan. 'Twill easier to a Cruel Prince appear, To spill a Subjects Blood, then shed a Tear: But those true Show'rs wept by the Prince of Wales To judge him Innocent with me prevails. Aliz. This does but shew the King what he should Do, He need but Weep to be judg'd Guiltless too; Or if yet Guilty held, with little Pain A Lovers Tears will wash off any Stain. Plan. Though your not Crediting what I have spoke My just Resentment does too much provoke, Yet that you may my Friendship clearly see, Ev'n while you shew that you have none for me, Since what I said has not prevail'd with you, I will Convince you by this Solemn Vow: I swear the King nor any e're to me Mention'd that Love which makes your Jealousie; And should he e're for me a Passion have, Rather than wed the King I'le wed my Grave: These Vows your Friendship should to me restore. Sev. You cannot Ask, nor can she Promise more. Cleo. Such Vowes as these should your Belief perswade, And Friendship thus Renow'd is Stronger made. Aliz. Ah, Madam, now my Trouble is more high Then it was lately by my Jealousie; You could impose no Penance so Sublime, As thus to Shew me and Forgive my Crime. What ends one Pain a greater does begin, Since all my Grief for your imagin'd Sin Did not so much my wounded Mind Subdue, As does the Grief of having Injur'd you: Yet who can wonder that I Jealous grew Of so much Beauty and such Vertue too; The Perfectness of both you now have shown, The Last has pardon'd what the First has done. Plan. If what I did might to Reward pretend You give the greatest, being still my Friend. [Embraces her. Aliz. And may I be depriv'd of Life and Fame, When e're again I lose that Glorious Name. Exeunt. Enter King Edward, and Lord Latymer as in Discourse. Laty. To me th'assurance she did twice repeat. King. What! that my Son Adores Plantagenet? Laty. And with a Passion, Sir, that does appear More fierce then that which he first paid to her. King. Ah can he be so mean to Love again One who his former Passion did Disdain? One who was Guilty of so strange a Crime, As to give Kent that Heart she Promis'd him? And that her Scorn she might the more Display, Wedded a Rival on his wedding day; At least that day which was for him design'd. Laty Love never was to Reasons Rules confin'd, For 'tis a Passion, Sir, which onely knows Such Laws as on it self it will Impose. King. But Honour should oblige him to Abhor One by whose Guilt he was Betray'd before. Laty. A Lover thinks that no Dishonour lies In twice submitting to his Mistress Eyes. We soon with Love and Fortune reconcile, When either of them after Frowning Smile. King. Oh Latymer, the News thou dost impart Does with a Double wound afflict my Heart; First that my Son by such a Love should dare To blast those Glories he has won in War; Then that his Flames should be to her Address'd Without whose Love I never can be Blest.â Laty. starts. Why dost thou start? is it so strange a thing That so much Beauty should Subdue thy King? Rather admire I did not sooner bow To such Bright Eyes, then that I do it now; The Greatest Men that e're the World did Grace Have still allow'd to Love the Highest Place; CÃ¦sar, who gained many a Glorious Field, Yet did to Cleopatra's Beauties yield. Laty. Had he not won many a Glorious Field, That Love had been but as his Weakness held; His Conquests make us think his Soul Sublime, And many Victories Excuse one Crime. King. Whatever in my Love is judg'd amiss I'le expiate by Actions Great as his. Laty. But how, Sir, can you well Condemn your Son For Doing that which by your self is Done, Since both of you intend the same Design. King His Case my Lord does differ much from mine. For though we both Plantagenet Adore, Yet he has been Betray'd by her before: The difference is exceeding great you see She has Affronted him, but Conquer'd me; Love is at worst a Noble Frailty thought, But Love when Scorn'd is justly held a Fault. Laty. May I be Pardon'd if I speak my heart? King. what 'ere you think you freely may impart. Laty. May not the Prince then, Sir, as justly say You are more faulty to Alizia? You cease to love her in whose Heart you Reign'd, And he but loves her who his Love disdain'd; He with the best of Loves extreams is curst, But you seem guilty of the very worst; His Fault is, Sir, the lesser of the two, You too Inconstant are, and he too True. King. O do not wound me by reminding things Which rather Trouble than Repentance brings. Laty. The Fault which you Confess will you Pursue? King. We should not Sin, and yet we dayly do; I owe Alizia more then you can say, But what I owe her I want pow'r to pay: Plantagenet should onely Wonders do, She makes my Fault, and does excuse it too. Enter to them the Prince and Delaware. Prince. Sir, I am come to make you a Request Which if deny'd I never can be Blest; 'Tis a Request I beg you to Admit, And beg your Pardon too, for making it. King. I'le grant what e're you ask though ne're so great, If't does not concern Plantagenet. Prin. Sir, It relates to her in some degree, But it exceedingly relates to Me. King Then you are come, I doubt, to ask again My leave that she may twice your Love disdain, Since there is nothing else I can believe Unfit for you to Ask, or me to Give, And yet that Sin Honour should so detest, As you should never make it your request. Prin. If 'tis a Sin to love her, Sir, I fear. That every Man must Sin that Looks on her. King. Loving of her which is her Beauties Due From any other, is a Sin in you. Prin. How can it, Sir, by you be justly thought That what is Mandkinds Duty is my Fault. King. You know what Scorn she did to you dispence, And in such ways as Height'ned the Offence; Without the Blemish of that double Stain, She had within your Heart deserv'd to Reign; Prin. But had not I through those Fierce Tryals run, I had not Merited what I had Won. King. Too far she in those Guilty Tryals went, When she abandon'd you to Marry Kent; Prin. His Fate is Nobler who Deserves, but Fails, Then his who Merits not, and yet Prevails. King. But those Fierce Tryals which she us'd you to Makes her Incapable to Merit you; For should she love you now 'twould be too late; The Wrongs of Honour what can expiate? Prin. Her Love, when e're Conferr'd, will Overpay The Affronts of Scorn and Tortures of Delay; Against her Beauties 'twere the greatest Fault To think her Love can be too dearly bought. King. Rather that cruell'st Injury she gave Should all your Scorn and all your Hatred have; Then do not Hope I ever will allow That by my leave she twice should Injure you, Ask all those Provinces your Sword has Won, Ask me to share with you the English Crown, And that true Kindness with does me dispose Still to deny you Her, would grant you Those. Prin. The Empire of the world I should Disdain, Unless Plantagenet with me did Reign; No Charms would in that Throne to me appear, Without I had your leave to place Her there; But if you grant me what I now implore, I cannot Ask nor can you Give me more. King. When first her Beauties in your Heart did Reign, I had design'd to Marry you in Spain; And the consent I of Don Pedro won, By which you had Succeeded to his Crown; But by affection for you I was led To give you leave Plantagenet to Wed. What Act of greater Kindness could be shown, Then yield your Love should lose so fair a Throne? You have lost Spain by your first Fatal Flame, And by your second you will lose your Fame. Those Wreaths which Conquer'd France for you have made By such a Guilty Fire will quickly fade. Prin. I doubt not, Sir, but by my Sword to gain As large a Monarchy as that of Spain. Fortune the Valiant may to Thrones prefer, But 'tis by Sufferings I must Conquer her. King. Ah Prince, since nor your Reason nor your Fame Can cure you of so Criminal a Flame, I'le try if my Commands can make you do What Fame and Reason cannot lead you to; I here enjoyne you, son, by every thing Which binds you to your Father and your King, This sinful Love without delay decline, Which should your Horror cause as well as mine, For if this Passion longer you pursue, You'll lose your Fame, your King and Father too. Exeunt King and Lord Latymer. Prin. Two Ills he offers, one he bids me choose, I must my Mistress or my Father Loose; Why should he strive by Nature to remove The highest bond of Nature that of Love? Though Nat'ral 'tis t'Obey a Fathers call, Yet to love her is much more Natural; Since he would have me yield to Natures sway, Where she most Rules there I should most Obey? Dela. Since She, your King, your Father, and your Friend Oppose your Love, give to your Love an End; Any of them the Conquest ought to Win, Then to Oppose all Four will prove a Sin. Prin. Ah Delaware, the Sin were much more Great Should I now cease to love Plantagenet, Then I to kill my self I must needs consent My Love and Life being of like extent. Dela. Your Passion is Unjust while 'tis so Great, You pay Loves Score with what is Natures debt; If in your Love so prodigal you are, With what, Sir, will you pay your Fathers Care? Prin. Ah 'tis his Love for her, not care for me, Which makes him treat me with such Cruelty; Against all Rules of Justice he does go, Making himself both Judge, and Party too; If to Love her who wrong'd me be a Crime, The self-same cause makes Love a Fault in him. Dela. More by a King and Father may be done Then may be by a Subject, and a Son; Let calmer Thoughts you to your Duty bring, Pronounce the names of Father and of King With that Respect which is to either due, And yield to those Effects 'twill work in you, Those Pow'rful Names will then Victorious be. Prin. I find in either dwells Divinity, For nothing less of Force enough could prove To hinder me to speak to her I Love. This is the very utmost I can do, And this Heav'n knows will prove my Torment too. Dela. Silence, Sir, is but half of what you owe, You should suppress your Inclination too. Prin. My Inclinations must be let alone, For though 'tis Mine yet it is not my own. Dela. Onely to Lovers this Distinction's known; How can it, Sir, be yours, and not your own? Prin. Subjects who from their King the Pow'r have got Are still his Subjects though he Rules them not. Oh Friend, in my Condition there appears Two Motions like to those which Rule the Sphears; My Love the Rapid Motion I may call, My Duty to my King the Natural, Which while it does it's Regular Course obey, Loves Rapid Motion hurries it away. [Exeunt. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FOURTH ACT. The Scene opening, King Edward and Lord Latymer appear in a Garden discoursing. Lat. Sir, 'tis past doubt, the' Intelligence is true. King. What the French King the Princes Rival too! Lat. And to so great a Height, as I believe A period to their Friendship it will give; For never any yet could soar above The fierce Resentments of a Rivalls Love. King. Friendship between them two can hardly be Of so much Strength as Nature is in me; Since Love in me does Nature's Force subdue, Doubt not in them 'twill Conquer Friendship too; 'Tis the Prerogative of her Bright Eyes For Love of them to breake all other Ties. Lat. Is it then just you on the Prince should lay Commands above his Pow'r, Sir, to obey? King. Oh Latymer, I grant I am to Blame, But 'tis not Love alone does me Inflame; Glory in that I act does bear a part, Glory does fire my Mind, as Love my Heart; Nothing for me seems Worthy to Pursue, But what my Son Attempting Fail'd to do: Since he to such an Envied Fame does rise, Mine will Burn dimme if it Outshine not his. Lat. Oh Sir, can you who have such Glory won Grow Jealous of the Glory of your Son. King. He never Glory Lov'd who could Admit Of any thing which might Outrival it, From this Resolve nothing can me remove; Nature must yield to Glory and to Love. Enter King John and the Prince, who lock the Garden-dore. Lat. Sir, I perceive the Prince and the French King, Something Important does them hither bring, For they are come alone and lock the gate; If, Sir, conceal'd a while you here will wait, Perhaps you'll learn what in their Loves they'll Do. King. That's a discourse deserves my list'ning to. King Edward and Lord Latymer conceal themselves behind the Scene. King Jo. 'Tis such a Secret as shall clearly show The perfect Friendship which to you I owe, Since what to tell my self is scarcely fit I to your Secresie shall now commit. Prin. Though nothing can to me more Pleasure give, Then Proofs, Sir, of your Frienship to receive, Yet among Friends there may such Secrets be, As to disclose them were an Injury; But you too well the Laws of Friendship know, And are too Generous to use me so. King Jo. That Friend must to himself appear Unjust Who takes as Injuries the Marks of Trust; Yet tell me, Sir, what can that Secret be Which to Reveal would be an Injury. Prin. Shoul'd you have brib'd your Guards to set you free, 'Twould be an Injury to tell it me; For I should be, what ever I should do, False to my King and Father, or to you. King Jo. Could I corrupt or else his Guards deceive, I'de not return to France without his leave, That Generous Usage he to me does show Secures me here more then his Guards can do, And though this Bond do Strong enough appear, Yet a far stronger does Confine me here. By your great Friendship, Sir, I here am ty'd. But tell me freely, is there ought beside Which by a Friend a Secret may be thought, Which told a Friend, his Friend may think a Fault? Prin. Yes, Sir, yet I will mention but one more; Looking fixedly on the King. Suppose two Friends one Beauty did Adore; If he, whose Heart her eyes the last o're came, Should to his Rival Friend disclose his Flame, He well might think the Injury was Great. King. I hope you do not love Plantagenet? Prin. Yes, Sir, I do, and with a Love so High As it can never Cease until I Die. King. Ah, Since you Love her and to that Degree, Why was your Passion not Reveal'd to me? Telling you first she does my Conquerour prove, You make your Friendship Guiltier then my Love. Prin. Why should I tell you what you needs must know, For whosoeuer sees must love her too. King. Since such high Pow'r does to her Eyes belong, Think not in loving her I do you Wrong. Prin. To love such Charming Eyes no wrong can be, But 'tis a Wrong to tell your Love to me. King Since all who Look on her she must Subdue, Is it a wrong to tell you what you knew? Because you thought your Love was known to me, You judg'd your Silence was no Injury; But I, as soon as I her Lover grew, Judg'd it a Duty, Sir, to Tell it you, Consider which of us has done the worst. Prin. I who first saw her must have lov'd her First, Therefore my Passion must be known to you. King. I hear'd you Lov'd Her, and she Lov'd You too, But afterwards she did Inconstant prove, And I believ'd that Wrong had Cur'd your Love. Prin. Her Beauties were unworthy my Esteem, If any thing more Powerful were then Them. King. Knowing their Pow'rs, admire not if you see That Love more strong then Friendship is in me. Prin. Yet since I to her Beauties first did bow, Your Love's a Wrong to me, not mine to you. King Jo. Affronts the Ties of Friendship may undo, Yet you still love her though she injur'd you; You clearly have Declar'd in what you Did, That her Fair Eyes does Friendships strength exceed; And she who spight of Wrongs triumphs o're you Triumphs o're me in spight of Friendship too. Since she o're you the greatest Pow'r has shewn, Blaming my Passion you more blame your own; Our Love in both or neither is amiss, Yours above wrongs, mine above Friendship is. But the Success of mine I may dispair, Since now I know that you my Rival are; I with Disgrace am cloath'd, but you with Fame, Which makes me merit Pity more then Blame. Prin, How can I, Sir, that Pity give to you, Which o my own Case is more justly due? Besides her change for which my Soul does mourn, Besides my Friend who does my Rival turn, As high an Ill as both of these I feel. King. May you that Secret, Sir, to me Reveal? To me who though as Rival you may blame, Yet I your Friend more than your Rival am; For at this Name I Grieve, at that Rejoyce, This is th'Effect of Force, but that of Choice. [Embracing him. Prin. Oh I did err, and in a high degree, Repining that you Rival were to me, Since 'tis more fit that pain I should abide Then that her Eyes this Triumph were deny'd; As both in Love and Friendship I exceed, So both Disdain in common paths to tread; Unjust to Her and Love I should appear, Would I without a Rival conquer her; King. This Declaration I unmov'd receive, Since you to be your Rival give me leave, But though Plantagenet should prove unkind, Yet in my Friendship I some ease shall find; For should the worst of Fortunes be my share, Your Trophies I should raise in Love as War: Thus I by Friendships Pow'r shall be supply'd With what to me my Fate and Love deny'd; My Friendship for you nothing can impair Since it stands firm, though you my Rival are; For I who best her Beauties pow'r do know, Find your excuse from thence for being so; And to confirm this Truth, I now will show That Secret to you, which you ask'd to know. Prin. Those conquering Beauties which did us subdue Have made my Father turn my Rival too. King I thought he Lov'd the Fair Alizia. Prin. And, Sir, I thought you Lov'd Valeria. King. Our Conquerours Eyes must every Heart reduce, In my own Fate I find the Kings Excuse. Prince. 'Tis She alone with the high Pow'r is blest Of Captivating Freedoms prepossess'd. King. She does in the same Fate, such is her Pow'r, Involve the Conquer'd and the Conquerour. Prin. But 'tis not, Sir, at this that I repine, I know where e're her Beauties please to shine, They ought to Conquer as their Native Right, Me by his Rivalship he does not Fright; For 'tis Her choice alone which can improve The highest Lover to deserve her Love: And, Sir, my Flame which brightest shall appear, Would make it Sin should I a Rival fear; But that which does my Soul with Grief subdue, Is his forbidding me to Love her too: Oh why should the Paternal Right oppose The nobler Right which Love on her bestows. King. Oh Prince your Case is difficult I see, He should have treated you, as you treat me; But in the Fatal strait which you are in, You must against your Love or, Nature sin; What Resolution think you to pursue? Prin. Ah 'tis much easier to Resolve than Do; For once I thought I could so far Obey, As silently to Mourn my Life away; But Love the Monarch Passion of the Soul That Resolution quickly did controul; Making me find that her Triumphant Eyes Are much more pow'rful then all Natures ties: Yet that no odds of you I may receive But what my greater Love to me does give, I let you know on her this night 'Ile wait, And from her Sentence I'le receive my Fate: Sir, if you please, you may goe there with me, And both together learn our Destiny; I hope, if mine does prove a happy Doom, My Father by Submission to o'recome; But if a Fatal Doom she does dispence, That will Revenge my Disobedience. King. Since you allow me, I on you will wait Of that bright Beauty to receive my Fate, Though I already cannot but foresee The certain Ruine that must fall on me: For she must be Unjust as she is Fair, If of her Love she makes me not Dispair; Or if she should me with her Favour bless, Your Grief for it will Kill my Happiness; Fate neither way to me, does hope allow. Prin. The value of her Love you injure now, Since whosoe're her Favour does possess Is past, the relish of unhappinessâ King. If of her Love such Thoughts I do admit, My height'ned Friendship is the cause of it; And, Sir, you are oblig'd by Honours Laws T'excuse Effects where Friendship is the Cause. Prin. Admire not that my Rival I reprove, For too much Friendship, and too little Love; But pardon me, since I therein express I prize her Right above my Happiness. King. Ah generous Prince, such Vertues shine in you, That you in Love as War must all subdue. Prin. Since, Sir, together we resolve to go, And from Plantagenet our Fate to know, 'Tis fit that we no longer should defer To beg her leave this night to wait on her. King. But e're we know the Sentence she will give, Let us from one another, Sir, receive A mutual Vow that still we Friends will be. Prin. That to our Friendship were an injury; It is its own Security you know, And does more strongly bind than any Vow; Against our Friendship Love in vain contends, For though we Rivals are, wee'll both be Friends; Yet give your Friend that pity he does seek, Who to obey Loves Law must Natures break. [Exeunt. King Edward and Lord Latymer. King. Never an Act so Insolent was done, Affronted by my Pris'ner and my Son! Both know Plantagenet is lov'd by me, And yet my Rivals both presume to be; In my Revenging it I'le lose no Time, Their Sufferings shall be equal to their Crime; I'le make them feel that 'tis a dangerous thing To dare to court the Mistress of a King. Lat. I beg you, not for their sakes but your own, Let first this storm of Anger be o'reblown, 'Ere you determine what is fit to do, Then such Resolves you safely may pursue. If Patience guide you not, they will esteem, Your Passion onely, Sir, does punish them. King. Delay, in the Affront they cast on me, Would be not Patience, but Stupidity. Lat. Consider, I beseech you, Sir, how they The Pow'r of Love not Reasons Pow'r obey. Such strange Effects that Passion does produce, As for all Faults Love is its own Excuse; Love does our Noblest Faculties controul, 'Tis in effect the Feaver of the Soul. King. My Lord, such talk as this I'le not admit, Share not their Guilt by thus excusing it, But follow them and let them understand They now are both confin'd by my command: This night in which their Love they should have shown, I am determin'd to declare my own; Since by their Love my Pow'r they injure so, I by my Pow'r their Love will punish too. [Exeunt several wayes. Plantagenet, Delaware, Cleorin. The Scene Plantagenets Chamber. Dela. Those Fires of Love have still most torturing been, Which though they highly Burn'd, have Burn'd unseen, And under those which I discover'd now, For many years my Conquer'd Heart did bow; Admire not yet I could so long disguise From your own Sight the Acting of your Eyes; For though the Sun on the Earths face but shines, Yet by his Influence he does ripen Mines; Your Eyes, which Shine at least as Bright as He, Perform like him things which you could not see, But yet this Breast in which your Beauty Shin'd May boast of Love, purer than Gold Refin'd; Your Eyes alone perform within may Heart More then the Sun on Mines though help'd by Art. As it was just my Love I should display, So 'tis as just your Will I should Obey; Which I shall do when you but speak the word, Though 'twere to pierce my Heart with my own Sword, And nothing in that Action I shall fear But to offend your Image which is there. Plan. My Lord, I think you from your Sister know The Friendship which I always had for you, Yet since your words th'occasion does admit, I will my self give you a Proof of it: Though your declaring of your Love for me Is in it self no little Injury, Yet for my Friendships sake I'le pardon you, If you th'Offence will not again pursue. Dela. Madam, your Justice should this Usage blame, You cloud your Cruelty with Friendships name, As Judges to the Tortur'd Respite give, To lengthen Pain, but not to make them live; Such Usage yet were for that Servant sit Who durst Adore you and not tell you it, Though 'tis some Guilt to say I Die for you, Yet is that Guilt, Madam, a Duty too: Ah Madam, sure you ought not to deny To take the Debt, or bid the Debter die; Your Sentence is too Heavy or too Light, You either should me Kill, or Save or, quite. Plan. Since by your self, my Lord, I now am told, Your Love for me is more refin'd than Gold, I'le put it to a Tryal but so vast, As never yet that Courted Metal past; Know then, my Love for which so much you strive Is not, alas, in my own Pow'r to give: The Prince of Wales.â Dela. In Pity say no more, Fate never had a Curse like this in store, Rais'd to the Charming'st Hope of all the World, Into Despair I now from thence am hurl'd, You keep that Word to which your self you ty'd, And Try me more then ever Gold was Try'd; That Glitterring Earth, when it has pass'd the Fire, Is the Refiners Wonder and Desire; But I, having Loves Fiery Tryal past, Like the Neglected Dross away am cast. Cleo. Oh Brother, had not Love your Mind deprav'd, You'd think you were not Cast away but Sav'd; The Crime you act she calmly does reform. Dela. Ah! such a Calm is worse than any Storm. Cleo. How can the Princess more obliging prove, Than to give Friendship, when she cannot Love. Dela. Oh Sister, he who to her Love aspires, To nothing less can limit his Desires; Loves Pow'r must always Friendships pow'r outdo, For Love at once is Love and Friendship too. Cleo. You should with Joy what she bestows receive, She Gives in Friendship all she has to Give, And to convince you, hers is Great and True, She the first hour her Secrets Trusts with you. Dela. Since to Receive my Love she does deny, She by her Anger ought to make me Die; That's the best Proof of Friendship she can give, And therefore that alone I can receive. He for her Love does grant himself unfit Who can be won t'outlive the loss of it. Plan. What I have yet perform'd can but pretend To let you see how much I am your Friend. But that, my Lord, which now I do Design Shall let you see how much I think you mine; For by your Councel and Assistance too, The life of all my Hopes I will pursue. Admire not Shame thus in my Face prevails, When I confess I love the Prince of Wales; For though th'Affront which I from him receiv'd Does make me blush that after it I liv'd, Yet I, whether by Weakness or by Fate, Still Love that Prince whom I ought most to Hate; And how that Love with Honour to pursue, Is that in which I ask advice of you;â Dela. starts. For he esteems you in such high Degree, As you the fittest are to give it me. Dela. Oh Fate! Oh Love! why do you both agree, To give such Beauty so much Cruelty? Is't not enough my Flame is scorn'd by you, But you would make me help my Rival too? And my Resentments higher to Inflame, These Wrongs you do me under Friendships name; Madam, if this, if this your Friendship be, Ah give me Proofs then of your Cruelty; Either bestow on me your Love or Hate This Tyranny surpasses that of Fate; Fate onely made me Wretched, but 'tis you Alas would have me make my self so too. To Love you is a Confidence so high, As I for it do not refuse to Die: But do not let your Doom be so severe As thus to make me my own Murtherer; From those Fair Eyes which did my Love create I beg I may alone receive my Fate. Plan. Oh why should you be griev'd to this Degree? Love, which does govern you, does govern me; 'Tis Love gives Laws to us, not we to it, And to his boundless Pow'r we must submit; Since by its Influence of my Love you miss, I give you that which of next Value is, And hope by Friendships Kindness to remove Your Grief for wanting Pow'r to give you Love. Dela. Ah Madam, How can you that Friendship prize Which could destroy the Conquest of your Eyes? And would against its nature make it prove A Rivals help, and Mutherer of Love. 'Tis past the Pow'r of Friendship to bestow Such Joyes as those 'twould ravish from me now, Yet think not strange that I deny to you What I deny'd my Prince and General too; For your Triumphant Eyes, since his return, Have made his Fire once quench'd more feircely Burn; This Fatal Secret he to me confess'd, And unobey'd made me the like request; But yet your Cruelty does his Surpass, He did not know that I his Rival was; But you who knew it strive to make me do What known to him Love had not forc'd him to; Fortune both ways my Torments does advance, By Friendships Knowledge and its Ignorance. Plan. Ah! that Blest Secret which I learn from you Makes me with Greater Hopes my suit renew; For 'twere below your Vertue to undo At once, my Lord, a Friend and Mistress too. Sure to that man Loves Pow'r was never known Who valu'd not her Joyes above his own. Consider, since I lov'd him while I thought That his Inconstancy did cause his Fault, If any other Love my Breast can fill, When from your self I find he loves me still: Since 'tis my Fate onely the Prince to Love, Since therefore all your Hopes must fruitless prove, Assist your Prince and Mistress in distress, And help that Love which nothing can suppress; Quenching by such a Gen'rous Act you Flame, From your Misfortune you'll increase your Fame, Retire, my Lord, and think on what I said, I know, when Love does once the Heart invade, So Pow'rfull is that Passions Influence, As 'tis not easily remov'd from thence, But when alone you weigh what's ask'd by me, Reason and Honour must Victorious be. Dela. Oh Madam, though the Trouble be not light Of being thus commanded from your Sight, Yet that torments me in a less Degree Then those Desires which here you lay on me: Yet e're I go this Sacred Vow receive; I to Obey you, Madam, will so Strive, As, If I can, my Flame I will suppress, And on my Ruine raise your Happiness; But if I quench not Fires which you create, Accept the Duty, and deplore the Fate. [Exit Delaware. Plan. Go, my dear Cleorin, and lose no time, Improve th'Impression I have made on him, For that Blest Secret he reveald to me Shews that on him depends my Destiny. [Exeunt several wayes. Enter Guesclin hastily who meets Delaware. Guesc. My Lord, I have been seeking you with News Which will at once Horror and Grief infuse, My King and your Great Prince are both confin'd. Dela. From what Black Coast blows this Tempestuous Wind? Guesc. By the Lord Latymer I understand, They are imprison'd by your Kings command. Dela. The cause of it did he not let you know? Guesc. 'Tis what he could not, or else would not do; Let us by sev'ral ways imploy our care, First to discover why they Prisoners are, That known, we may more hopefully apply To this Misfortune a quick Remedy. Dela. Let's hasten to this Work, for 'twere a Crime In serving them to lose one moments time. [Exeunt several wayes. The Scene is Plantagenets Bed-Chamber. Plantagenet and Valeria's Brother sitting, and in Discourse. Val. Bro. Th'Assurance, Madam, which to me you give With Joyes above expression I receive; 'Tis you alone those Blessings can extend Which both my Merit and my Hopes transcend. Plan. You in such moving words your Love have shown, As I in Justice could not less have done; Some Time and Industry it will require Fairly to reach that End which we desire, But leave it to my care if you think fit. Val. Bro. She who must make my Fate should govern it; While 'tis in such fair hands it is secure. Enter a Lady, hastily. Lady. Madam, the King is almost at the door. They both rise up hastily. Plan. The King, Oh strange Misfortune, and so near! Val. Bro. What would he think if he should see me here? 'Twill ruin all which we design'd to do. Lady. The King does come the way which he should go. Exit Lady hastily. Plan. By what dire Planet is he hither led? A noise within. I hear him, hide your self within my Bed. Valeria's Brother hides himself in Plantagenet's Bed; She goes to meet the King. Enter the King. King. Since I enjoy at last this long'd for time, I hope you will not think it is a Crime? Madam, If I employ it now to say, An Adoration to your Eyes I pay: An Adoration Words would ill express, For could I tell its Greatness, 'twould be less; So high a Passion ne're was paid before. And yet I blush, Madam, that 'tis no more. Plan. Do you consider, Sir, what now you say, Such Vows you should but to Alizia pay; Sir, you mistake, to her alone they'r meant. King. Ah say not I mistake when I repent; You may believe what I now say is true, Since of most Love I speak, and speak to you; To you who have given mine such perfect strength, As 'tis uncapable of more but length; That Falshood might Truths piercing sight escape, It slowly moves, and in a borrow'd shape; But Truth which onely fears to be unknown, Moves speedily, and no disguise puts on. Plan. 'Tis strange this Love should grow so great so soon. King. The Dawning of it was a perfect Noon; For what such Eyes, Madam, as yours create Must reach Perfection in their first Estate: Yet since I did Alizia first Adore, I grant I merit this neglect and more; But you the name of Tyrannous will win Revenging a Misfortune as a Sin; This usage too will an Injustice be, You Wrong your Eyes while thus you Punish me. Plan. Were there nought else 'Ide not be false to her. King. Beauty should still a Conquest most prefer. Plan. They Tyrants are who to usurp delight. King. Who has most Beauty has in Love most right. Plan. You wrong your Mistris while my Love you seek, And I my Friend in hearing what you speak. King. To Love another after you are seen, A greater wrong, Madam, in me had been; I fully know the great debt which is due, To your fair Eyes and to your Vertues too; And it had been below them to have gain'd A Heart in which no Beauty e're has reign'd; But mine before had yielded to the Pow'rs Of conquering Charmes which none excel but yours: What greater merit can my Passion shew, Then thus to leave Alizia to love you, This of its vastness is a proof sublime. Plan. Ah what you call your Merit is your Crime, Since perfect Love in Justice must excel, Falshood and he together cannot dwell. King. That perfect Love is just I grant is true, And I prove mine is Just in Loving you. Your Eyes which act the Change you so abhor, Are my security I'le change no more; Since to the highest Beauty I pretend, Blame not if by Degrees I reach that end; And as my Love that blessing does pursue, So now I find it onely shines in you. Enter Alizia and Sevina. Aliz. This Duty daily must be paid by me, And though 'tis lateâ She starts back amaz'd seeing the King. Oh Heaven! what is't I see? Ah! would these Eyes, rather than see this Sight, Had been clos'd up by an eternal night. King. What is it, Madam, which you thus bemoan? Aliz. Can you ask that since you two are alone, And at an hour, so Guilty as it showes The Falseness of her Friendship and your Vows! To me this Sight so vast a Grief does give, As makes me wish rather to Die than Live. King. And, Madam, 'tis some cause of Grief in me To find in you so strange a Jealousie. Aliz. If you who do the Wrong, Sir, can admit Of Grief; What then must I that Suffer it? But, Sir, your cause of Grief shall be remov'd, My Death shall shew you soon how well I lov'd. [To Plan.] Go treacherous Woman, False as thou art Fair, Those Hopes you rais'd on your wrong'd Friends Despair Shall soon be blasted, for my injur'd Ghost Shall still pursue you for those Joyes I lost; Where e're you go, revenge it shall invoke, And shew you still that Heart your Falshood broke: You still shall see it or shall hear it groan, And it shall haunt you in his Bed and Throne. [She offers to go out. Plan. Oh go not yet away. Sev. At least be pleas'd to hear what she can say. Aliz. Whatever she can say I do dispise, I'le not believe her Words above mine Eyes; And I have seen so much, as I now fly To seek out Death my onely Remedy. Exeunt Alizia and Sevina. Plan. So well her height'ned Spirit, Sir, I know, As what she Threatens she too soon will do; If by your instant Kindness or my Care We do not stop th'Effects of her Dispair, Forgive me if I leave you to attend The Debts I owe to a Dispairing Friend. The King stays her. King. Oh leave not your Adorer to pursue One who does hate you, and usurp'd your due; If to receive my Passion you decline, Even her Dispair will be less great then mine. Plan. Detain me not, She'll die through our delay. King. And I shal die should you thus go away. Plan. She needs my help. King. But does not it implore. Plan. Her Case deserves it. King. Mine deserves it more. Plan. Her Grief does wound me. King. So my Love should do. Plan. Your Love's her debt. King. 'Tis onely due to you. A great skreik within. Plan. That Fatal Skreik must cut off our debate, For my best speed I fear will come too late. She breaks from the King, and goes out hastily. King. She's gone and left me in a deeper Grief Then her's to whom she flies to give Relief; She does her Hatred to my Love prefer, To me she's Cruel, but she's Kind to her: 'Tis Fortune onely or resistless Fate Which governs all the World in Love and Hate. The King stands musing a while: Valeria's Brother thinking him gone, comes from behind the Bed; The King lifts up his eyes, sees him, and starts back; Valeria's Brother runs into the Bed again. King. A Man, and here, and at this time of night, How quickly did He vanish from my sight? Does she a Visitant like this admit, Though my bad Angel 'twere I'le speak to it. The King draws his Sword, and goes towards the bed. Who art thou? and what is it brought thee here? The King plucks Valeria's Brother out of the Bed, who trembles, but answers not. His Tongue is ty'd by Guiltiness or Fear; Prepare for Death, or else resolve my Doubt; He's silent still, what Ho, who waits without? Enter two Courtiers running. Since my Commands thy silence cannot break, I'le find out Tortures which shall make thee speak. Seize on this Mute, and with him follow me. They seize on Valeria's Brother. Why should the Thrones of Kings so envy'd be. When such strange Griefs assault me in one hour, As make my Sorrows greater than my Pow'r. [Exeunt. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIFTH ACT. Enter King Edward and Lord Latymer. King. I have in short told you my cause of Grief, Which is as Just as 'tis above Relief. Ah! to forsake one in whose heart I Reign'd, To Court another who my Flames disdain'd, And such a Lovely Youth thus hid by her, Are loads too heavy for my Soul to bear. Lat. Though, Sir, the Fair Plantagenet may be Too justly blam'd for one Inconstancy, Yet in all else her Vertue such hath been, As to suspect it, Sir, would turn a Sin. King. Oh she, who could for Kent my Son forgo, What is it after, which she might not do? She must have given that Love for which she prest, Were not her Heart by other Fires possest; I'le not defame her since she bears my name, But she for ever has supprest my Flame. Enter Sevina hastily. Sev. If with your Love, Sir, for Alizia You have not thrown your Pity too away, Be pleas'd to see where She Despairing lies, And with your Hand vouchsafe to close her Eyes. King. Madam, what is't which her Dispair does move. Sev. Oh ask not that when she has lost your Love; She did a while that Misery suspect, But when the certainty she did detect, She had, but that our strength was her Relief, By one dire blow ended her Life and Grief; When from her Hand the Weapon we did wrest, Such storms of Sighs did crow'd out of her Brest, And from her Eyes such streams of Tears did flow, As we repented that we stop'd the blow; For sure the loss of Life is a less Ill Then that Despair which does possess her still. But though we did one sort of Death prevent, Yet she on dying, Sir, is so intent, As from Plantagenet I now am come, Who dares not, Sir, one moment leave the room, To tell you that th'Assurance of your Love Can onely these resolves of Death remove; Despair alas so pow'rful is in her, 'Twill be too late should you the Cure defer. King. Ah lead me then where my Alizia lies, For in her Sorrow I so Sympathize, As I alas without disguise may swear, Her grief wounds Me much more than it does Her. Exeunt. Enter Delaware and Cleorin. Cleo. 'Tis a strange Secret which you have reveal'd, But why alas was it so long conceal'd? Repair that Fatal Sin you did commit, And fly to tell your Prince and Mistress it. Dela. As all those Sins which for a Crown are done Heaven does absolve, when Heaven does put it on; So all those Crimes which are perform'd in Love Do lose that name when we successful prove. Cleo. But since of yours you cannot hope Relief, Do not delay to cure your Prince's Grief. Dela. Ah my dear Sister, if my hopes were fled, You soon should see your wretched Brother dead; But who in Love does as a Lover strive, Lives while he Hopes, and Hopes while he does Live. Cleo. Ah! to such empty Hopes impose an end, By making Blest your Mistress, Prince and Friend; So losing of your Hopes, you soon will see A greater blessing then your Hopes can be: Has Love the Pow'r to sink the Soul so low, As to deny what Vertue bids you do? What Nobler Fate can Love give to your pain, Then to deserve that Love you cannot gain. Dela. Should I this Secret to them both confess, 'Twill rather raise then make their Troubles less, While under their Delusion they remain, Their just resentment robs them of their Pain; But were that happy Fallacy remov'd, She with such Passion by the King is lov'd, As they can ne're possess what I shall lose, And 'twill in them a lesser Grief infuse, Never a hope of Union to admit, Then be so near, and after miss of it: Besides the Kingdom may be plung'd in War When such a Son and Father Rivals are. Cleo. Ah! you should blush to talk at such a rate, Make not your Crime an interest of State; Better that War you dream'd of should ensue, Then you should shun what Honour bids you do: Oh 'tis in you too Guilty a Distrust, When you fear ought more then to be Unjust; Consider should the Prince or she e're know That Secret you to me discover now. Dela. I fear not that 'tis, onely known to you. Cleo. Yes but it is. Dela. âto whom? Cleo. âYou know it too. Ah! little Honour in your Soul does shine, Should not your Knowledge fright you more then mine; To what low State Love does a Lover bring, Is your own witness then so slight a thing? Let Vertue and not Fear make you repent, Guilt is a greater Ill than Punishment; Have you not found what I have said is true? [Studies a while. Dela. My Passion strives my Vertue to subdue, Pity your Brother whom Love Masters so, As he does fear what Honour bids him do; Pity your self, for it is you alone This hopeless guilty Passion must Dethrone. Cleo. To conquer Love there needs but little skill, Since none can want the Pow'r who has the Will. Dela. There's none does want the Pow'r his Hopes to kill, But to Destroy them who can have the Will? Cleo. Your Cure were finish'd were it but begun. Dela. Ah this is easier said then it is done: Yet I from you this double good have got, To know my Debt, and grieve I pay it not. Cleo. Who grieves he does not what he can and ought, Is guilty of his Torment as his Fault. Dela. Ah! you did never yet the Torment prove, Which springs from Honour that disputes with Love. Cleo. The Torment lies in the Dispute alone, Let Honour Conquer, and the Torment's gone. Dela. But Love assumes o're me so strange a right, As 'tis at once my Torment and Delight. Cleo. You'll find, if Vertues Dictates you pursue, Greater Delights exempt from Torments too; For though successless Love be no small pain, Yet Guilt in Love wounds deeper than Disdain. Dela. Oh Cleorin! that which you now have said, Has in my Soul such an Impression made, As I perceive Love made me too long stray, And Honour now would lead me in the way; To that bright Guide I am inclin'd to Trust, I'le rather be Unhappy then Unjust. Cleo. Such Charms in following Vertue you will find. Dela. Ah! should you press me more you'd be unkind. Do not all th'Honour of my change ingross. Leave me part of it to support my Loss. Cleo. 'Tis not to Vertue that you now resort, If it wants strength its own self to support; 'Tis onely Sin not suffering that it fears, It grows the stronger the more weight it bears. Dela. I know in all it's own support 'twill prove, Unless in quitting such a Charming Love; Then think it is my Wisdom, not my Fault, If I seek every help in this Assault. Sister, Farewell, I will retire a while, That I may Love and Vertue reconcile; Consider well what such a Love must be, As with your Vertue dares to disagree. [Exeunt several wayes. The Scene opens. Alizia appears lying on a Couch, King Edward, Plantagenet, Latymer, Sevina, and Women Attendants standing about the Couch. Aliz. Ah, 'tis enough to Die, Sir, by your Hate! Too much, your Triumph thus to Celebrate; Yet I repine not, since you come to see That your Contentment is so dear to me: As when I found my Life oppos'd your Love, I chose by Death that trouble to remove; And I implore your Pardon since the debt Is onely paying, and not pay'd you yet, But, Sir, my Rival can declare for me, 'Tis not my Fault, though it my Trouble be; For she, her Cruelty is grown so high, Makes Death my wish, yet hinders me to die. King. Oh I am come to wait upon you now, That I may be both Just to her and you; I must confess that her Inchanting Eyes; Did for a while my Guilty Heart Surprise; But what I now shall tell you is as true, Madam, 'twas I, not she, was false to you; Her Friendship for you did the Conquest get, I did Assault, but could not vanquish it. Do not believe that what is spoke by me Is onely to suppress your Jealousie, That I thereby the safer Pow'r may win To persevere in and repeat my Sin; Oh no, that Love and Grief which you have shown Has all the Magick of her Eyes o'rethrown: On Fancies Wings I my past flight did take, But 'tis on Tryals Wings that I fly back. Aliz. Alas! if Words could cure a broken Heart, Those you've now spoke would have that Pow'r or Art; They come too late, they should have come before, Life you can take away, but not restore: But, Sir, the loss of mine my joy shall be, If in my Death my matchless Love you see; For, Sir, to you I me more concern'd to give Proofs of such Love then I'me concern'd to Live, Which justly you might doubt, if after I Did know I lost your Love I should not die. King. Ah the best Proof you of your Love can give, Is that you'l Pardon me, and that you'l Live; Has my first Crime made me so black in Sin, As my Repentance no Belief can win? Do not believe I did the Sin commit, Or else believe my Penitence for it. Let not one Fault which is already past, Have greater force then Love which still shall last; Ah! sure you could not thus your Death pursue, If you believ'd what I have Vow'd is true; But all those Doubts intirely to o'rethrow, My Lord I charge you instantly to goâ [Speaking to Latymer. And let at once King John and my Son free Who were the Pris'ners of my Jealousie. Lat. 'Tis a Command I joyfully obey. King. I Charge you do it and without delay. [Exit Latymer. Madam that King, may safely court you now, [To Plantagenet For I before you and Alizia vow, My flame for you shall ne're revive againe, And my Alizia onely here shall Reign. Plan. In what, Sir, you have said and vow'd, I find, To me you'r Iust, and to Alizia Kind. Nor can your Solemn sacred Vow, Sir, be More pleasing to my Friend, then 'tis to me. I hope that name, Madam, I may resume, And safely keep it for the time to come. Aliz. Heaven knows my Sorrows never were more high, Then when I thought that you had layd it by; And yet my Ioy that you forgive my Sin, Is now as vast as e're my Griefs have been; Twice now your Friendship you to me restore, May you refuse it, if I need it more. Plan. No fear of loseing yours I can admit, Since I will ne're do what may forfeit it. Madam, 'tis fit I leave you with the King, That he your Cure may to perfection bring. (Exit Plantagenet. King. Ah Madam, why in her, should Friendship be Of greater pow'r, then Love or Grief for me. Since Friendship her Resentments does subdue, Let Love for me as Pow'rful be with you; Madam, to you my Heart this Suit prefers, Which needs your Pardon more then you did hers; To this sad State your King alas is brought. Aliz. Sir, I forgave you when you saw your Fault, And I repine not at my Lingring Death Which lets me Seale it with my Dying Breath: No Proof of Love could ever be more high, Then to forgive th'offence which makes one Dye. King. If you forgive me, yet your Death pursue, You will at once Forgive and Kill me too: Loves Pow'r you wrong while at this rate you grieve, For Love should heal worse Wounds, then it can give. Aliz. I can alas, Sir, but too truely say Tis only Love which makes me disobey, For I should not deserve the Love you give, If after you recall'd it I could Live. King. And I of Life should too unworthy be, If I could Live after you Dy'd for me. Your Love for me by Living must be shown, For you to save my Life must keep your own, And if my Words you give no credit to, What I have Vow'd my Grief will make me Doe. Aliz. Ah then all thoughts of Dying I'll decline, Since you have vow'd your Life depends on mine, But if again to her your Love you give, My just Despair will be above Repreive. King. Oh Madam, you will wound my Soule again, If such a fatal Doubt you entertain; My Grief for the great Crime I did commit, Will still preserve me from repeating it; By all those Vows which bind me most I swear I'l still love you and never more love her. The Scene closes The Scene is Plantagenets Chamber. Plantagenet, the Prince, Cleorin and Delaware. Plan. Oh what has been reveal'd by Delaware His Freindship showes, but heightens my Despair, It makes me Guilty, Sir, to such Degree As you'd be Guilty shou'd you pardon me, The Knowledg of my Fault so wounds my Mind, As only I in Death my Ease can find. Prince. Alas your Grief more cruel is to me, Then, Madam, your suppos'd Inconstancy; For to such Height my love for you is grown, As your Greif wounds me more then does my owne, You'le punish, by a Sorrow so Sublime, My Innocence more then you did my Crime: But though the Word of Innocence I nam'd, Yet only I can be with Iustice blam'd, For had I not that Fatal Letter writâ Plan. Oh, Sir, I cannot such Discourse admit, For while requests I for your Pardon make, Alas, my Guilt you on your self would take, When all the Guilt to me alone is due, Who did believe a Letter more then you. Prin. Alas, have you Design'd to let me see, That every way you mean to ruine me? For while you did suspect my Innocence, You to my Rival did your love Dispence: And Madam, now that Heaven has thought it fit, To make it evident, you punish it; For by these pretious Teares, which now you spill, You make me wish, I were thought Guilty still. Plan. Oh Sir, what does your Innocency prove, Makes me too Guilty to deserve your Love. Prin. Ah be not cruel to this strange degree, Let not my Innocence my Ruin be. No Reparation could be reckon'd more, Then what the injur'd person does emplore; But you will make, if this be your intent, Your Reparation my worst Punishment, A Punishment so cruel, and so high, As it transcends the imagin'd Injury: Yet if you think, that you amiss have done, Let me then name the Reparation 'Tis Madam, that you'l never think so more, But give me leave your Beauties to Adore. Plan. Heaven, Sir, does know, and so does Cleorin, That while I thought you guilty of that Sin; Which only my Misfortune made me do, I Lov'd you Sir, and Lov'd none else but you. Prin. And Heaven does know and so does Delaware, That while I thought you Guilty as you're Fair I did not you but my ill Fortune blame, And still preserv'd for you a deathless Flame. To Delaware, My Lord, to her and me, this Iustice do, As to oppose me, if I speak not true. Dela. Sir, you for her did still such Love express, As Heaven knows too, I griev'd it was not less. Prin. Ah if you give belief, to what we say, Doe not refuse the perfect Love I pay. Plan. Alas, a greater Sin I should commit, Then that I mourn for, by accepting it, But all the world will know that I repent, When on my self I lay this Punishment, Which, Sir, by Iustice dictates I have chose, Since 'tis the higest which I can impose. Your Glory, Sir, would wither if not dye, Should you Love one so guilty, Sir, as I. The penance I design'd let me pursue; Tis what, Sir, on my knees I beg of you. She offers to kneel but is hindred by the Prince. Prin. Ah doe not, doubly thus my Soul subdue, By such denyals, and submission too; But to my Suit be pleas'd to condescend, Or else my Grief my tortur'd Life shall end. Dela. Such were the Arts us'd by the Earl of Kent, As both seem'd Guilty, yet were Innocent. Cleo. Madam, while you such scrupulous Vertue show, The Prince may of your Love suspitious grow; That moveing sorrow, which he does express, Invites your kindness now to make it cease. Plan. Sooner then you such Grief, Sir, shall admit, I will obey, what ever you think fit; I rather, Sir, will an Injustice doe To my own self, then seem unkind to you. Prin. Ah Madam, in those happy words I find, You are to me at once both Just, and Kind; No Satisfaction e're was hop'd by me, But that you might that Innocency see Which Delaware's great Friendship made appear, Who is thereby for ever setled here, Where Madam next to you he still shall grow. Dela. Ah could a Prince ought to his Subject owe; I might then think, to me you are in debt. Prin. To me your Friendship has bin always great, Yet I must Tax it of a seeming wrong, Since this blest Secret, you conceal'd so long. Cleo. What justly does this seeming wrong excuse, Shall, Sir, present you with more welcome news; While your great Father was in Love with her, He as a Subject, Sir, had cause to fear A Secret so important to declare, As might perhaps have caus'd a Civill War. But, Sir, now that the King has this blest day Resum'd his Love for fair Alizia, And has by Vowes, which oft he did repeat, Renounc'd his Passion for Plantagenet, Which from her sef, this very hour we know, My Brother lost no time, to tell it you. Prin. These charming Words which now from you I hear, His Justice shews, and ends my greatest Fear; Nothing from Heaven was left me to implore, But that my Father Rivall'd me no more. Cleo. What fitter time can Fortune give to you, Then thus your Ends in Love still to pursue; Lose not one Moment of it, for perhaps Those Conquering Eyes may make him soon relaps. Prin. What you advise your care of me does show, Forgive me, Madam, If I leave you now; Since 'tis so vast a Blessing to implore, As granted I shall never leave you more. Plan. That Grant the noblest Blessing, Sir, would be, Could it make you as happy as 'twill me. [The Prince offers to goe out. Dela. Stay Sir, I scorn your Goodness to abuse, Or own your Pardon, to her Feign'd Excuse; Fear made me not the Secret, Sir, conceal, Nor the King's Change the Secret now reveal; For those were Motives of such mean degree, As, Sir, I blush that they were nam'd for me; Those Reasons, Sir, of which shee did make use, Obtain'd but did not Merit your Excuse; My guilty Doubts, a while have kept me Dumb, But Love and Honour have those doubts ore'come. Plan. My Cleorin, what will your Brother doe, Cleo. I am as ignorant of it as you. Dela. Now all the Truth shall be to you reveal'd, For 'tis too Glorious, Sir, to be conceal'd. Know, Sir, those Beauties which did conquer you, Became, while Kent did live, my Conquerors too. At Poitiers they did me to Glory bring, And made me grace your Triumph with a King; And though some Honour I acquir'd that day, Yet, Sir, that prosperous Action I may say Did on no score to me so welcome prove, As making me more fit to Court her Love; Rais'd by this thought for England, Sir, I came, Where soon her Beauties did revive your Flame, And Fortune against me was so much bent, As you your Rival made your Confident; And by a Cruelty unknown to you, You in your Love my help Commanded too. Prin. I am amaz'd, my Lord, at what you say. Dela. Though that Command I wanted pow'r to Obey, Yet Heaven my witness is how much I strove, To make my Duty overcome my Love; But when I found, by what I did endure, That she alone, the Wounds she gave could cure; I meant the Secret never to disclose; And when your Father did your Flame oppose, I try'd your Love by reason to subdue, But that attempt, Sir, proveing fruitles too, Inspir'd by Love or guided by Despair, I to her self my Passion did declare. Cleo. Of this Discovery I Fear the event. Plan. It merits Wonder and not Punishment. Dela. But when I for her Favour, Sir, did sue, Alas she said her Love was given to you, So given as nothing could recall her Grant, Since your forsakeing her that pow'r did want; And in her Words and Accents made appear, Her Flames for you did equall yours forher; Convinc'd by this, that following my Design, Would blast your joyes, but not procure me mine, In which I was confirm'd by Cleorin, The Noble Fatal Conquest I did win; And forc'ed my self that Secret to declare, Which builds your Blessings on my own Despair. Cleor. Yet Glory must on that Despair attend, In which you serv'd your Mistress, Prince, and Friend. Dela. Though, Sir, twas much your Mistress to adore, To help you, while your Rival, yet is more; Now, Sir, my Story to an end is brought: Or Praise my merit, or condemn my Fault. Prin. Oh you so nobly, have orecome your flame As your Despair cannot transcend your Fame. That Heightned Friendship which our Loves secures, In our Contentment will present you yours; Your Friendship yet on me such Debts does lay, As I must too Despair, those Debts to pay; Plan. 'Tis Nobler much, if you dare credit me, To be th'Obliger than th'Obleig'd to be; But in that Heart your Prince did first obtain By Freindship plac'd, you shall for ever Reign. Dela. If ought could cure the Grief of loosing you, What you both said, that Miracle would doe. (Exeunt Enter King Edward, King Iohn, Lord Latimer, Count Guesclin, and all the Men. King. Ed. What, as a Lover, could I less have Done, Hearing what past betwixt you and my Son; Strange are th'Effects which Jealousy produce, But fully, Sir, to purchase your Excuse, I come to visit you, and let you know, That I no more a Rival am to you, My Anger though 'twere great, yet it was Short. K. John. Sir, I admire no more at your Transport O're hearing all we in the garden said; But you have now full Reparation made. Enter Delaware and Prince Prin. Sir I more Greive I did a Fault Commit, Then I am Pleas'd that you have Pardon'd it, But, Sir, I hope that Freedome you'd restore Is but an Earnest that you grant me more; My Great Request, Sir, is Renew'd by me, Granting me that is more then Liberty; Such Strange Discoveries I have made this day, As all the favour for which now I pray Is, that to let me court her you'll consent, When you your self have judg'd her Innocent. King. Ed. But will you cease to court her when I prove, You being judge, she Merits not your Love? Prin. This by my Duty, Sir, I promise you. K. Ed. Then what you beg'd of me I grant you too, Prince. Be pleas'd then, Sir, to order Delaware Without Reserve his Knowledge to Declare, And what he Sayes I hope you will Believe. King. Ed. To what he speaks I still will Credit give. Dela. I shou'd be too Unworthy of this Trust, Should I abuse a King so Great and Just; When to the Warts of Aquitaine I went, I made a Friendship with the Earl of Kent, Who in a Charge did such deep Wounds receive, As, finding that he had not long to Live, A Messenger in hast for me he sent, As soon as e'r I came into his Tent, He told me Something on his Heart did lye Which griev'd him more then he was Griev'd to Dye, Then in my Hand he did this Letter lay, And in a Sigh his Soul did fly away. Prin. When you have heard it Read, it will Afford Proof of her Vertue. King. Ed. Read it then my Lord. The Earl of KENT to the Lord Delavvare. My Death forces me to discover by what Arts I obtained, from the Prince of Wales, the faire Plantagenet. Before He ador'd her I did; and as soon as he fell in Love, (not knowing mine) he made me his Confident; but the King, being against the match, the Prince the better to cloud his reall passion for Plantagenet, seem'd to have one for the fair Aurelia; but still trusted me with the Superscription, Cypher, and Seale, which he used when he writ to my Plantagenet, and I had the fatal employment of carrying all their Letters. At length, the Glory the Prince wonn at Cressy, joyn'd with his grief for the King's denyal, conquer'd his Father; and the Day was appointed for his marrying Plantagenet, which, if not prevented, I found would be the Day of my Death. This I imparted to my Mother, who had no small ascendant over Plantagenet, and by my Mothers advice, I got the Prince to write a Letter to Aurelia, (whom I seem'd to be passionatly in Love with) wherein he beg'd her pardon, for having counterfeited a Love to her, when his was otherwise disposed of; but to repair it, he earnestly recommended me to her affection, as most worthy of it. This Letter I seal'd, and superscribed with the Cypher the Prince alwayes made use of to Phantagenet, whom my Mother had so warmly alarm'd, with the Prince's passion for Aurelia, that this letter being delivered to Plantagenet, in a fit time, all written with the Prince's own hand, sealed and superscribed, as all his Letters to her were wont to be, made her so abhor the Prince's inconstancie, that in the dictates of those resentments, she gave her self to me, whereunto my Mothers Friendship with her, did highly contribute. The Prince in despair, undertakes the war with France, and, I, soon after, disguised to all but you, follow'd him, in hope by some great action to wash off the Guilt my Love forced me to contract; but here I met my Death. Tell them all this; and that I hope their hatred to me, will be buried in my Grave. Dela. This Letter till this day I have conceal'd, For Causes, Sir, unfit to be Reveal'd. Prin. I hope you find in what he did relate She was not Guilty but Unfortunate. King. Ed. I must confess these Arts which Kent did use Doe her forsaking you too much Excuse. Prin. Since this has wash'd off her imagin'd Stain, Give me your leave to love her, Sir, again. King Ed. I would not have defam'd her, but I see To cure his Love there's but that Remedy; No, Prince, the Sin she did last night Commit Makes her for ever for your Love unfit. Prin. Oh Heaven! must I endure a new Assault? Tell me I beg you, Sir, this Fansied Fault, For she is of such an unblemish'd Fame, As I can give it well no better Name: But, Sir, to try me this perhaps is done. King. Ed. I doe not use to trifle with my Son, And I beleive you I credit what I said, When I my self found hid within her Bed A Lovely Youth, who since is dumb with Fear: My Lord, bring instantly that Pris'ner here. (to Latimer. (Exit Latimer. Prince. Though I my self what you have said should see, Yet I would think my Eyes were False not She. King. Ed, Since to your Witness I did credit give, Methinks what I have said You should Believe. Prin. Forgive me if her Vertue and my Love Forc'd me to speak what may your Anger move, Fate never man to such a streight did bring, I must offend my Mistress or my King, Esteem her Guilty, or not Credit you, That, Sir, I cannot, this I Dare not Doe. Enter Latimer and Valeria's Brother King. Jo. Valeria's Brother! Love is just I see, Since he Revenges my inconstancy, And makes him punish his fair Sister's wrong. King. Ed. If still thy Fear has not ty'd up thy Tongue, Discover to the King and to my Son, How thou by Charmes Plantagenet hast won, I found thee in her Bed, there's no Excuse, Valer. Broth. Sir, that's a place which few men would refuse. Enter Plantagenet, Alizia, Cleorin, Sevina, and all the Women. Shall (not one moment) stay thy Destiny. Plan. The Words and Anger of the King are High: Alizia, Sir, and I but now did hear, That with this Gentleman you Angry were, We come to beg you to forgive his Crime. King Ed. Of all the World you should not plead for Him, For you by it so Great a Guilt do show, As I had rather but suspect then know. Plan. I know not what you mean by what you said. King. Ed. You know not too you hid him in your Bed. Plan. Who could to you that Secret, Sir, declare. Kig Jo. Oh Heaven! does she Confess then he was there? Val. Bro: That, Sir, I hope is no Offence to you. King. Io. False Youth, to me what worse Wrong could'st thou do? Val: Bro. I thought my Sister had your Heart possest. King. Jo. But did'st thou not from her to me protest, She bid thee help me if I ere should be In Love with any one more Fair then She? Val. Bro. And doe you, Sir, confess that you are so? King Jo. Those Charming Eyes must every Heart ore'throw. Val. Bro. This Guilt in you will cause her Death I fear. King: Jo. Thy Guilt to me is more then mine to her, What do'st thou aile, thou tremblest and lookst pale? Val. Admire not, Grief does or my soul prevail, When to Valeria's self such Words you said, taking off her Disguise As, Sir, does make her wish that she were Dead, But though she's killd by your Inconstancy, Yet in your Armes she begs your leave to Dye. she faints. Plantagenet holds her up. Plan. She faints; Ah, Sir, that Guilty Change in you! King, Jo. Oh Madam, blame not what you made me doe. Plan. Sir; 'tis not Just to charge your Fault on me. King. Ed. Is it Valeria then? King. Jo. Yes Yes 'tis she, Her Broth'rs face so much resembles hers, As I, deluded by the clothes she wears, Did to her self my Change in Love avow. Prince. The Clouds of my Despair do vanish now, And Charming Hopes in me begin to Reign. Plan. Give her more Air for now she Breaths again. Valeria is set in a Chair. King. Ed. Oh I the fair Plantagenet did wrong. Prince. The Proofs that she is Guiltless are so strong, As I now beg you will no more deferr To give me leave to make my Court to her. Alizia. Sir, in the Princes Suit I also Joyne, King Ed. Her Vertue now does with such Lustre Shine, As to Repair my having Injur'd it, I his Addresses to her doe permit. Prince. In this more then a Father you appear, Tis less to Give me Life then Grant me Her; But, Sir, before this Blessing I pursue, I must do Justice to my Rivall too, Sir, I did promise you on her to wait, (speaks to K. Iohn. And from her Sentence to receive my Fate, This Promise I am ready to Performe. King Jo. No Heart did ere endure so Fierce a Storm, Who can support those burthens which I bear, My Vowes confine me here, my Passion there; By leaving her my Noblest Hopes I end, And by not leaving her I Wrong my Friend, Some Sacred Pow'r teach me what I should doe. Plan. Your Honour bindes you, Sir, to keep your Vow; She told me, Sir, that Sacred Oath you Swore That you no other Beauty would Adore, And though you often for her Love did press, Yet till Misfortune brought to you Distress; She never could, though she did often strive, Perswade herself his Passion to receive; But then all Danger, Sir, She did Despise, And came to Visit you in this Disguise; But oh what Horror did her Soule invade, When she o're heard what you to Guesclin said, Of that unhappy Love you had for me; She for that wound no better Cure could see. Then to make me her freind and Confident. King Jo. Ah what for me could Fortune worse invent? Love she deny'd when t'would have made me Joy, And onely gives it now 'tis to Destroy. Plan. This, Sir, by Vow she ty'd me to conceal, Till you to me your Passion should reveal, Beleiving that would be the fittest time To tell you, and Convince you of your Crime, In which I promis'd my Assistance too: All I have told you hapned, Sir, when you (to King Ed. Did (unexpected) visit me last night, Which put us both into so great a fright, I, least Ill Thoughts in you it might create, Finding a man (suppos'd) with me so late, And she to be dicover'd did so dread, As, Sir, I did conceal her in my Bed, Where I forgot her in my Freinds Despair. King. Jo. Madam, we wait till you your Doom Declare. Plan. Oh let not, Sir, my Sentence make you Doe What Love and Honour now doe call you to; She Merits you, so Bright her Love does Shine, And, Sir, the Prince of Wales possesses mine; Behold the fair Valeria does revive, If you'l Aske Pardon she'll a Pardon Give; She your past Fault but for a Dream will take, If, Sir, she finds you True when she does wake. King Jo. I can no more (your Pow'r so high does rise) Resist your Sentence then I could your Eyes, And those Commands which now on me you say I beg you will Assist me to Obey. Plan. You have your King so wounded with your Grief, To Valeria. That he, as much as you, does need Releif. King Jo. With an Afflicted Soul I waite on you, To own my Fault and beg your Pardon too; Madam, I hope a Love which ne're shall Dye Will expiate one short Inconstancy. Valeria. Ah! though I ne're more Reparation sought Then, Sir, that you should see and owne your Fault, Yet you my Heart so wounded by your Crime, As to recover it requires some Time. King Jo. Though I this Penance, Madam, must deplore, Yet I must grant my Fault does merit more. Prince. Now, Sir, to raise our Joys above Increase, To this great King give Liberty and Peace. King Ed. Those Offers which I always did Decline, To Gratify you both, I now will Signe. King. Jo. While in this way my Freedome you Restore, You and the Prince make me your Pris'ner more: Your former Conquest, Sir, to this must Yield, This wins my Friendship that but won the Feild. King. Ed. This is a Conquest we delight to owne, 'Tis more to gain your Friendship, then your Throne. Now all th'Alarm's of Love and War shall cease, And yeild their roomes to the soft Joyes of Peace. The Curtaine falls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE TO THE KING. The Poet, Sir, has offer'd to your sight An English Prince, whose Fame appear'd so Bright, As never any since his time was known, To shine with clearer Lustre, but your Own; For though Immortal Honour he did gain, By conquering France, and by restoring Spain, Yet, Sir, you brought Three Kingdomes to Remorse, And gain'd by Vertue more then he by Force; Which, Sir, on you a greater Name bestows By conquering Them by whom he conquered Those: 'Tis more by Vertue England to o'recome, Then by the English to beat Christendome. As when the Universe was to be made, The Vast Design was on the Waters laid; So you in Conquering it like Method keep, Laying your first Foundation in the Deep: Though the Black Prince, so happy, Sir, did prove, As to be Crown'd with Victory and Love, Yet Sir, he knows from you he may receive A Nobler Crown then War or Love can give; This makes him like the Poet trembling stand, Till, Sir, that Crown be given him by your Hand.
