      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Sophonisba. Syphax. Masinissa. Scipio. Roman Soldiers. Numidian Soldiers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Camp of Scipio in Africa.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Syphax, with Roman Centurions. Sy. You may at least here leave me to myself Till Scipio's return.âMy hands, my feet, Are manacled with fetters; Syphax now Stands in the centre of the Roman camp; Of every means of flight is he bereft: Grant him, at least, a respite from your presence. SCENE THE SECOND. Syphax. Sy. How hard to bear is military pride! Should their commander as in real valour, In haughtiness surpass them ... 'Tis not so; Scipio is known to me: within my palace, At Cirta, he was formerly my guest: Most gentle and humane he then appear'd ... Credulous Syphax, dost thou speak in earnest? Then Scipio came to thee to ask for aid; Nor was he then thy conqueror.âVanquish'd king! Taken in fight, and bound in fetters, dragg'd Within the enemy's camp, dost thou yet live? ... Oh Sophonisba! to what obloquy Hast thou reduced me? Now, when I no more Ought, or design to live, I am so fall'n, That e'en the power of voluntary death No more is mine? ... But hark, the trumpet's sound Scipio's approach announces. See. He comes. SCENE THE THIRD. Scipio, Syphax. Sci. Let all my train retire. A retinue Would be an insult to a captive king.â Syphax, provided that the lofty pangs Of vanquish'd kings admitted of relief, Thou should'st now hear me speak to thee in terms Of pity; but the greatness of thy heart Is known to me, to which each pitying word Would be an added wound: hence, at this time, Nothing will I attempt, except to wrest, With my own hands, thy unbecoming fetters. This thy right-hand I ought indeed t'unloose; A pledge of friendship and of fealty, I well remember that thou gavest it To me in Cirta.âBut what do I see? My kindness thou disdainest? Motionless, And fierce, thou fixest on the ground thine eyes? Ah! if in battle Scipio had subdued thee, He with no other fetters than thy own, Than by reminding thee of thy sworn faith, Thy person had enthrall'd. Then yield, I pray, These iron manacles of thee unworthy; Yield them to me: raise thy disconsolate brow: And fix thine eyes, erect, on Scipio's face. Sy. On Scipio's face? Oft have I seen it near, With soul undaunted, in the ranks of war: Fortune, the arbitress of all things, now Wills that I should dare not to see it more. Nought should the Romans to this camp have borne But the cold relics of what once was Syphax: But to the valiant, death, though coveted, Sometimes is not allowed; and I am here, Alas! a lamentable proof of this; Ah, wretched that I am!âHence are these chains Become my portion; hence my downcast looks Are to the dust condemn'd; for never more Can I presume to raise them to the eyes Of a triumphant foe. Sci. Of the subdued Scipio is not the foe; and though till now Fortune hath look'd on him with smiles alone, He's not elated from a prosperous fate, As from an adverse he would ne'er be abject.â I am resolved to overcome thy pride By courteous violence. Behold unloosed Thy unbecoming chains: as man to man, Equal with equal, now to Scipio speak. Sy. Thou speakest courteously, and thou art courteous. If to a king it were supportable To be o'ercome, 'twould be so by thy arms. But what can I now utter, that may seem To thee becoming my past dignity, And worthy of my present wretchedness? And what remains for thee to say to me That I already know not? Sci. I? To thee I will confess, that yet so great I deem thee, And so magnanimous, that I doubt not To ask of thee the reason of thy change. Sy. It is not usual to make bare the heart Except to faithful and experienced friends; And kings are seldom, or are never bless'd With friends like these. Perhaps I, although a king, Was once not undeserving real friends: And, as a proof of this, I now to thee, Without disguise, will manifest my heart. In thee, a generous foe, 'twere more discreet Than in a feign'd friend, thus to place reliance. Then listen to me.âThou wert born a Roman, And I an African: the citizen Of an illustrious commonwealth art thou; I of a numerous and powerful people Was once the monarch. Interposing seas Sever'd from mine thy country; I ne'er placed In your Italia my encroaching feet; Thou standest sword in hand in Africa: The vanquisher of Carthage, 'tis your hope To bring all Africa beneath your sway. Carthage to me contiguous, was hence Alternately my foe and my ally: And though she also, equally with Rome, Execrates kings, her people, less than yours, From power and arrogance intolerant, Was thence by me less bitterly abhorr'd. By every commonwealth a monarch's heart Is tacitly aggrieved; what anger then Must that excite in him which dares to shew Towards him a haughty front?âBehold the whole Divulged to thee: my heart was resolute To hate you e'en to death, as insolent And predatory foreigners: to swear To you allegiance and fidelity, After your memorable deeds in Spain, Became my interest. Sci. But thou by proof Hadst known the valour of the Roman arms; Why didst thou violate thy faith with Rome? Sy. And what will Scipio say, if I divulge To him the naked truth?âThat mighty Scipio, Whose heart, th'abode of friendship and of pity, And of all elevated impulses, Hath hitherto proved inaccessible To love alone.âThe blandishments of beauty, That irresistible captivity Which love inflicts, hath wrought in me this change; To thee do I confess it; and feel not, In saying it to thee, the blush of shame Suffuse my face. A citizen thyself, The love of fame impels thee to surpass Thy fellow citizens; hence art thou deaf To other impulses: a king who sees, Seated upon his throne, no rival near, Such an incentive needs; hence, deaf to fame, His other flatter'd passions render him. Believe thou this from an unhappy king; For he may be sincere. Great as thou art, Feel pity from it rather than contempt, For I disdain it not from Scipio only. Sci. I never felt the flames of love, but I Respect, and even fear, his boundless power. Oft have I fled from him; for it is best T'anticipate his arrows, to whose wounds All after remedies prove impotent. Thou, ere thou saw'st her, should'st have felt mistrust Towards Sophonisba: finally, she was The child of Asdrubal, in Carthage born, Imbued with rancour and with hate towards Rome E'en with her very milk: if thou wert then By thy necessities united to us, Clearly might'st thou foresee, that detriment Must to thyself assuredly result In forfeiting our friendship. Sy. Dost thou then As nothing deem, that which so often sways, So often fascinates unwary man? Hope? I imagined, that, to Asdrubal United by such ties, in Carthage none Would equal me in power: then having seen The charms of Sophonisba, caught, subdued, In short more fetter'd than e'en now I am In this thy camp, with inadvertent steps, I from one error to another stumbled. For Sophonisba's sake I forfeit now My kingdom, my renown, and, what is worse, My self-esteem: and yet, would'st thou believe it? Fain would I languish out a few hours more In hated life, that I at length may hear Of her security. On her account Do no foreboding thoughts of infamy Oppress my heart: her soul, like mine, is lofty; Nor could she ever, more than Syphax could, Living, be dragg'd behind thy car a captive. Now hear, not thoughts that do become a king, But the wild ravings of a frantic lover. A jealous fury tortures me, and makes My vacillating life protracted death. Perhaps in Cirta, in my very palace, Is Sophonisba, by your arms subdued, Become already the illustrious prey Of Masinissa, of my mortal foe. To him a promised spouse ere to myself; Perhaps now he burns for her ... at such a thought, With desperate inexplicable rage I feel myself o'erwhelm'd. I wish to die, I ought to die; and powerless as I am, A thousand means of death do I possess. But ah! I know not how, nor can I die, Till I have learn'd her destiny. The prey Of Masinissa, ah! (if prayers of mine With thee weigh aught) ah! never, never grant That she his prey become ... Oh Heaven! ... I burn With rage ... But whither does that rage impel me Beyond my royal dignity?âNo more Remains for me to say ... permit that now I to my tent withdraw: I would conceal My unbecoming grief. Excepting Scipio, No man should see me in the Roman camp With face more ruffled than becomes a king. SCENE THE FOURTH. Scipio. Sci. Unhappy king! His words excite in me Equal compassion and surprise.âBut grieved Am I at heart at that which he has told me. By Masinissa, in beleaguer'd Cirta, Will Sophonisba doubtlessly be seen: And should he fall into the snares of love? And should he waver in his faith to Rome? ... Oh valiant warrior, by myself beloved, No less than indispensable to Rome, For thee I tremble.âWhat unwelcome cares Remain for thee, oh Scipio! How much grief Does it cost generous hearts to practise force Even on vanquish'd foes! Should I be then Constrain'd to practise it against a friend? ... Ah, this indeed, this is the only duty Of a commander, that my soul abhors.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Sophonisba, Masinissa, Numidian Soldiers. Ma. Lady, pause here: behold the leader's tent. Scarcely will Scipio have been heard, or seen, By thee, than all suspicion from thy heart Will be dispell'd. So. Oh Masinissa, yet Art thou not satisfied? I give to thee, I, daughter as I am of Asdrubal, A lofty and a terrible of love In coming with thee to the Roman camp. But, that I should sustain th'abhorred sight O' th'Roman leader? ... 'tis too much ... Ma. This camp In which we stand, thou may'st as much pronounce Numidian as Roman. A strong band Of my troops here are placed, and I am here No unimportant pillar of the war. Daughter of Asdrubal art thou no more; Widow no more of Syphax, since thou art The promised spouse of Masinissa. So. Ah! Let not the friendship which binds thee to Scipio Blind thee too much. He, whatsoe'er he be, Is evermore a Roman; hence he deems All things subservient to Rome; nor can he To any enemy of Rome be friendly. His rage towards me will not be pacified With having overcome, disgraced, and slain Syphax: oh no! Cirta, besieged and burn'd, The Massasyllii to the heavy yoke Subjected all, have not appeased in him Th'ambitious cruel thirst. Now, at the sight Of Sophonisba almost in his hands, Rightfully deem'd by him, for so I am, Implacably the enemy of Rome, Now, think'st thou not, that in his haughty heart He cherishes th'insulting hope, to drag Me through the streets of Rome bound to his car? Yet this I apprehend not; though a woman ... Ma. Oh Heaven! what thoughts are these? While there remains Within these veins of mine a drop of blood, Can that e'er be? Ah no! believe it not; Thy hate deceives thee now; thou know'st not Scipio. So. Hatred and love deceive me now alike. Here ne'er should I have come: but in the world There doth remain for me no place of safety. It pleased my heart hither to follow thee, And to my heart exclusively I trusted. But my renown, my judgment, and my duty, Appointed me, among its mouldering ruins, A sepulchre in Cirta Ma. Dost thou grieve That thou hast followed me? Alas! my life Is irksome then to thee ... So. To die not thine Would now alone afflict me: and to this Dost thou expose me. Thou art well aware, Oh Masinissa, that e'en 'mid the flames Of Cirta's royal palace, 'mid the death Of my defeated people, from thy lips Impassion'd sentiments I dared to hear. Alas! ... Already for a long time, I, By the renown of thy transcendent virtues, Which fill'd all Africa, had been enthrall'd. I, from my tenderest infancy, to thee Destined by Asdrubal, at once grew up Thy mistress and thy spouse. Then, like myself, Wert thou the bitter enemy of Rome: To Carthage and my father, afterwards, It seemed good to marry me to Syphax, And to thyself it also seemed good To be the friend of Rome: thus destiny Disjoin'd us utterly ... Ma. Ah! we are now, I swear to thee, for ever reunited. Thou with me reignest, or I die with thee. Having both personally seen and proved The sovereign virtues of the mighty Scipio, And having never seen thy peerless beauty, Were then the reasons that I fought for Rome. Syphax had ever been my enemy; He had despoil'd me of my throne: reduced By adverse fortune to extremity, I found, excepting Scipio, no friend In all the world; th'indissoluble tie Of sacred gratitude bound me to him. Since have I, combating in her defence, Amply deserved the benefits of Rome: But Scipio's benefits, his lofty, pure, Disinterested friendship, can alone By friendship, and by homage to his virtues, Be recompensed by me. Thee, thee alone Than Scipio more I love; thee only now Prefer to him; for far more than myself Do I love thee. So. To give me then a proof, Worthy of both of us, of this thy love, Swear to me thou, that thou wilt never let me Living be dragg'd from Africa. Ma. 'Tis useless, Yet, since thou will'st it, by this sword I swear it. Should I have brought thee here, if I had thought That here thou wert in danger? In my realm I might securely have transported thee With my Numidians: but the call of war Summon'd me here; I never from thy side Can be dissever'd. Africa and Rome Shall learn to pay thee homage as my consort: Hence I, an enemy to all disguise, Will now proclaim thee such. So. At length secure In my proposal, and thy solemn oath, I tranquillize myself ... But hitherward A multitude advances: to thy tents Meanwhile, 'mid thy Numidians, I retire. Ma. Since it seems good to thee, so do. This way Scipio advances; I will speak to him. Ere long I will rejoin thee. SCENE THE SECOND. Scipio, Masinissa. Ma. Scipio, I never more exultingly embrace thee, Than when a conqueror I return: I seem More worthy of thee then. Sci. Oh Masinissa, Thou'rt now become one of our main supports; Th'artificer of glory to myself At the same time art thou: hence witness, Heaven, How much I love thee; and that love thou knowest.â But tell me, (to the Roman general speak not, But to thy Scipio,) tell me, dost thou now Return indeed a conqueror? Ma. By my hand Cirta besieged, and by my hand destroy'd; And all the residue dispersed and slain Of the dead king ... Sci. How speakest thou? E'en yet Hast thou to learn that Syphax lives! ... Ma. Oh Heaven! What do I hear? Sci. 'Tis true, that dead in fight Rumour reported him. He in that fight Fell wounded, but not mortal was the wound, And thence by Lelius taken in my camp A captive ... Ma. Syphax lives? And in this camp? Sci. He is the noblest fruit of our success. But what do I behold? Does this afflict thee? Ma. Oh! ... what ... do I ... not ... feel! ... From my surprise ... But ... wherefore ... with such ... cold formality ... Dost thou receive me? ... What dost thou conceal Within thy breast? Sci. Ah Masinissa, thou, Yes thou indeed within thy breast dost hide, And to thy faithful friend, a mighty secret. Grief and distraction, rather than surprise, Are on thy face alternately express'd. Now whence could this arise in thee, if thus Syphax restored were not an obstacle To some conceal'd propensities of thine? Ah Masinissa!âAll I know; to me Thy silence doth reveal it; for thyself, Excepting this, nought in the world I fear'd. By her alone whom now into this camp Thou hast enticed, by her, and no one else, Thy glory, and the glory of thy friend, At once may be obscured. I did not stand In Cirta at thy side: to flames of love Hence hast thou sacrificed a distant friend. But yet, I do not of thy deeds complain; Thou givest me an ample proof of friendship, In not depositing thy prize elsewhere Than in my camp; in wishing to confide The conflicts of thy lacerated heart To Scipio's heart alone. Ma. âThat Syphax lives I hear most unexpectedly.âI hoped In Sophonisba to have found a consort: To me was she betroth'd ere given to Syphax: He ineffectually defended her Against our arms; and to a conquer'd king, Taken in battle, there is nothing left. But Syphax, though subdued, in heart is lofty; Nor long will he, I feel assured, survive This his disgrace.âBut, be it as it may With him, listen, oh Scipio, to my thoughts.â A warm and sincere friend thou long hast found In Masinissa: equally sincere, And more warm as a lover, learn that he Derides all obstacles. A lukewarm flame Never yet enter'd a Numidian heart: Or I will be loved Sophonisba's spouse, Or with her breathe my last. Within thy camp I was myself impatient to conduct her: Here only were the wishes of my heart Thoroughly satisfied; here, with lofty voice, Did glory, honour, friendship, virtue call me; Here, without forfeiting my love, I hope Completely to discharge my several duties. From my commander, and my faithful friend, I wish to learn how we may best succeed To vanquish Carthage; by what arts of war Rome's power and splendour may be best increased, And glory for ourselves; and, finally, How I may best ensure my happiness. Sci. Wert thou my only son, I swear to thee, I should not mourn, as now I mourn, the blind And youthful error that hath thus misled thee. Our glory, the prosperity of Rome, The imminent and total fall of Carthage, And thy unrivall'd, genuine happiness, All, all were in our power; before that thou Vanquish'd in Cirta, to th'assaults of love Submittedst to captivity: but thou Hast taken all from us, and from thyself, With this thy fatal love.âBut no; thou canst not Stifle the cries of thy upbraiding heart; Towards Syphax never canst thou be unjust; Nor canst thou ever to thy only friend Be cruel and ungrateful. This thy love Is by the life of Syphax now condemn'd, Dissever'd, and annull'd: nor ever thou ... Ma. Nor ever? ... Sophonisba shall this day My consort be; I swear that she shall be. And if, with living, Syphax would protract My anguish and his infamy, he ought, Upon this spot, himself, with his own hand, With his own sword, to slay me; or himself To-day, by my hand immolated, fall. Sci. Syphax defenceless, and a prisoner, Is in our camp; and in his heart conceives not 'Gainst Masinissa an unworthy thought.â Thou ravest now; but I am well assured, If once thine eyes beheld that wretched king, Thou generous, far from treating him with scorn, Ah yes! would'st be the first to pity him. But let us grant, that, be it how it may, By some means or by other, Syphax die, And hence thou be the tranquil possessor Of Sophonisba, to what party then, Think'st thou, would'st thou betake thyself? Ma. To Rome, And to my Scipio bound eternally, No power on earth ... Sci. But tell me, more than Rome Lov'st thou not Sophonisba? Ma. I? ... At present That would I not examine. Sci. Wretched friend! I, ere thyself, already know thou dost. I know, that having sacrificed thy interest, Thy judgment, and the sacred austere names Of gratitude, of friendship, and of faith, As victim to a luckless destiny, Thou rushest on destruction. Thou canst not Asdrubal's daughter at thy side long keep, And persevere the advocate of Rome, And make thyself th'abolisher of Carthage. Thy fate I fervently regret. For kings, The enemies of Rome, thou knowest well, Or soon or late, what ruin is reserved. I speak not thus with menacing intent, Oh no! suspect it not: may Heaven avert That I should ever be the instrument Of the just rage of Rome against thyself. This sword of mine, which formerly avail'd To reinstate thee in thy throne, ah no! Shall never with thy not inferior sword, Which hath augmented so illustriously Rome's lofty victories, for mastery strive. No, rather than 'gainst thee, would I direct Its point against myself: but tell me thou, Am I collected Rome? I am, thou know'st, A private citizen of Rome; nor arms, Nor counsellors, nor captains, doth she want. Another leader in my place will come, With equal fortune, with superior judgment, And less compassion, to these fated shores; And he will make thee recollect thy faith, Though pledged so solemnly, so weakly kept. Ma. Now, would'st thou that a man who is thy friend, Should, to the terror of precarious ills In future times, yield that which he denies To yield to friendship? Ill thou knowest me.â In short, I ask of thee, whether of Cirta, Spoil'd by my sword and my Numidians, And by my blood and theirs; whether to-day The booty of that Cirta doth belong To Rome or to myself? if Sophonisba, My promised consort, by myself alone Conducted hither, in this camp is deem'd The wife of Masinissa and a queen, Or if she be the slave of Rome? Sci. âShe was, And is, (alas, but too unquestionably!) The wife of Syphax still. Ma. I understand thee. Oh agony! ... and dost thou hope? ... Sci. To thee, Oh Masinissa, I resign the choice: From post to post defenceless in this camp I wander; thou by thy Numidians here At once may'st cut me off; thou may'st thyself Plunge in my heart thy sword: but to thy ruin I will not suffer thee to rush, if first Thou kill me not. But if thou have the heart To wish my ruin, of my own accord, I, for thy sake, embrace it. Keep thy prize: Rome, and her conscript fathers, then shall hear me Th'accuser of myself: I must confess, That to our private friendship I was pleased To sacrifice the interests of Rome, And of thyself; and I must, as the fruit Of my equivocal regard for thee, Reap unequivocal disgrace. Ma. Oh Scipio, Thy too great friendship is a thousand times More cruel to myself than menaces, Or arms, could ever be ... Wretch that I am! ... My heart thou rendest.âBut no power can thence Extract the firm inextricable dart That love hath planted there. Thy words infuse Corroding poisons to the cureless wound: This is indeed unheard-of agony ... Make me at once outrageously ungrateful, And treat me as a foe inveterate; Or as a pitying friend bear with my woes ... Thou see'st my tears; those tears canst thou restrain?â What do I say? Ah vile! What dare I say In Scipio's presence?âThou hast hitherto Beheld me frenetick.âLet this suffice.â Shortly shall Scipio, the Roman leader, Learn what has been th'immutable resolve Of Masinissa, the Numidian king. Sci. Ah hear me! SCENE THE THIRD. Scipio. Sci. Hence he flies! I will pursue him: In this distracted state I will not leave him; Spite of himself he should be saved; his heart Is noble; my solicitude he merits.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Sophonisba. So. Ah wretched me! What can have happen'd now? What fatal, what ferocious mystery Doth Masinissa harbour in his breast? What hath vindictive Scipio said to him? Ah evermore, I evermore foresaw That fatal to us both this camp would be.â Oh Masinissa! ... On my countenance Thine eyes were fix'd, swimming with undropt tears, And yet thou dar'st not speak to me ... With words Broken and faltering now thou call'st me thine; Now stern and desperate thine arid eyes, With a ferocious recklessness, from me Thou turn'st away; upon the naked earth Panting thou castest thy convulsed limbs; And with terrific howlings didst invoke Th'infernal furies ... Ah, thou hast transfused Already thy own furies in my breast.â Be they whate'er they may, this heart possest A presage of the menaces of Scipio. All I foresee; yet nothing do I fear. Now that he is my open enemy, As he should be, now will I Scipio hear, And make him hear the thoughts of Sophonisba ... But who is this coming towards me? ... Is this Reality? ... Oh Heaven! ... Syphax alive? ... And in this camp? ... Oh unexpected sight! SCENE THE SECOND. Syphax, Sophonisba. Sy. A deep amazement on thy face is painted, Oh lady, in beholding me again?â I should have been no more: in this respect Fame was propitious, but my fortune adverse. So. Oh unexpected and appalling sight! Now is the horrid mystery at once Fully unravell'd ... Sy. To thyself thou mutterest? Speak, speak to me. Behold me; I am he, Thy consort am indeed, who, for thy sake, My sceptre and my honour having lost, Deprived of both, in Roman fetters bound, Yet on the brink of the much wish'd-for tomb Awhile delay my steps to learn thy fate. So. What words are these? ... where shall I hide myself? ... Sy. Ah! do I see on thy bewilder'd face At once the characters of shame and death? Thy desolate impenetrable silence Speaks a clear language: in thy heart I read The conflict of a thousand impulses. Yet no reproaches shalt thou hear from me; Although insulted, and in fetters bound, By all deserted, yet for thee, oh lady, Far more than for myself I feel compassion. Thou knowest if I love thee.âI'm aware That Asdrubal's commands, the bitter hate That thou for Rome hast in thy breast, alone Were thy conductors to my bed; for me Thou never feltest love. Thus I myself, Thou seest, plead in thy defence. I know That with another not unworthy flame Thy bosom glow'd, or ere thou wert my spouse. Love, by experiment, I comprehend. Its force omnipotent, its madnesses, I know them all; and hence, spite of myself, Have ever loved thee. Thou, by laws divine And human, forced to love me, not for this Was it e'er possible for thee to do it. Hence jealous rage, by little and by little, Feeds on my heart: I thirsted for revenge; And on my hated rival still could wreak it Although a captive ... But thou conquerest, lady: More than a jealous, I, a sincere lover, Would now leave thee in safety by my death.â Pardon thee, groaning; in a horrible life, Persist, though hating it, and this alone To behold thee once more; strongly at once Desire thy death, and happiness with others; Now as the luckless source of all my ills Would curse thee; weeping, would adore thee now As the sole blessing left to me in life ... Behold, in what distracting agonies The latest moments I drag on for thee Of my protracted and opprobrious life. So. ... I will presume, although with trembling voice, To unveil to thee my thoughts.âLittle remains For me to say: magnanimously thou My cause already hast too warmly pleaded: Daughter of Asdrubal, and wife of Syphax, It now remains alone for me to die As worthy of these names.âAt the report Spread of thy death, 'tis true that I presumed My hand to promise; but 'tis not yet given: Thou livest, and to Syphax I belong. T'avenge thy cause and mine at once 'gainst Rome, No firmer champion could have been secured Than Masinissa. Blinded, I confess, And caught by his incomparable prowess, I purposed to estrange him from the Romans, And make him the deliverer of Carthage. But Syphax lives; and I return once more, Whatever fate he chuse, to be of that A constant, and not quite unworthy, partner. Sy. Thy lofty proposition deeply soothes A wretched monarch, and a spouse not loved; But to a lover, as I am to thee, Ardent beyond expression, it is death. I have already, and a long time since, Fix'd in my heart my fate, which thou, oh no! Should'st never share with me. Then, lady, now Listen to my entreaties and commands ... But I see Scipio, who towards us advances; He is the only person in the world To whom I would address my latest accents. SCENE THE THIRD. Scipio, Sophonisba, Syphax. Sy. Hear me, oh Scipio.âIn thy presence vanish Dissembling purposes: all shame departs That would forbid me to confess a weakness: Thou, although none in thy great heart abide, Great as thou art, conceivest them in others, And pitiest them humanely.âThis is she, (Attentively regard her,) the sole cause Is she of all my wretchedness; but yet All my affections I have placed in her. Thou for myself hast not yet seen me tremble; Now for another I descend to prayers; I am compell'd to do it ... So. Certainly Asdrubal's daughter causes not thy prayers. Am I not equally with thee secure?â What, Scipio, canst thou do to me? I, born A Carthaginian, enemy to Rome, And in the Roman camp a prisoner, I yet undaunted stand ... Sci. The fatal power, The disappointing power of destiny Places us all in hard extremities. I do not, most assuredly, exult In your calamities: and thou in vain Now in my presence makest a parade Of thy innate antipathy to Rome. What though the cruelties of Annibal Banish from Roman bosoms all compassion, Thence do I not a rancorous hate indulge Against these enemies. If I am forced To meet with them in fight, victorious, I envy and admire them; but, subdued, I pity and I aid them. Sy. Thence, to thee, That which to no man I would e'er have said, I trust myself to say ... So. What would'st thou say? Thou for thyself would'st certainly not ask Aught from the conqueror. Nothing e'er from him Would I receive; not even his compassion. What have you more to say? Before great Scipio Say who would venture to degrade himself? But, e'en were I degraded, to behold Before my eyes the spoiler of my race, The instrument of ultimate destruction To my illustrious country, that alone Would now inflame me with magnanimous rage. The foe of Scipio, though he be humane, I am as much as I'm the foe of Rome: To make myself worthy of this, I ought Rather in Scipio now t'excite surprise, Than puling tenderness. Sci. Each lofty soul Which meets with adverse fate, almost makes me Abhor my own prosperity. So. A joy Fatal, but yet a joy, glows in my breast, Now that I am allowed at length t'unfold My feelings to the noblest of the Romans. The mingled conflicts that assail my heart, Thou only canst conceive, who art at once A perfect man and citizen.âTo him, Cradled in Carthage, no less than to him Who pass'd his childhood on the Tyber's banks, The name of country, more than all things else, Is graven in the heart. Effeminate thoughts In me, although a woman, if they gain'd, Gain'd but a second place. I loved those best, Proud Romans, who best hated you. Your foe Was Masinissa once; and at the sound Of his magnanimous and youthful feats Was I inflamed. Syphax was then of Rome I know not whether the ally or vassal.â These now are my last words; I speak to Scipio, And to thee, Syphax: artifice avails not; For both of you know well the heart of man. The traces of our earliest impressions Remain profoundly graven in our breasts: Hence hearing that the death of Syphax gave Entire superiority to Rome, And Masinissa's image to my thoughts At the same time occurring, I design'd (Perchance my heart suggested it) to wean From Rome her champion, and to make of him A shield for Carthage and myself. Thence I Hither among your eagles came a foe. And the audacious hope that swell'd my heart To entice from your alliance Masinissa, Induced me to relinquish many duties; I feel the dereliction; culpable, And self-convicted, I proclaim my guilt; And I already am prepared to make A lofty reparation. Perhaps my fate Led me towards you with an invisible hand, To give no mean impression of myself: Behold a path is open'd to me now To manifest to Rome what lofty soul May animate a lady born in Carthage. Sy. My unexpected life, I clearly see, Is the sole absolute impediment To every view of thine: but my existence Will be a vain and transitory shadow. My real life in that same moment ceased When ceased my liberty: thou knowest well For what I did survive. I learn from thee Heroic fortitude. Although thy words Inflict a horrid torment in my heart, Thou should'st have told thy thoughts to me alone; I left thee worthy to avenge my fate, And so I leave thee now ... So. Oh doubt it not, Others remain to avenge us. Let each man His duty here accomplish; mine are changed By thy revivalâI've divulged to thee The most conceal'd affections of my heart: This Scipio heard; to whom I were a foe Unworthy, had I spoken otherwise. Sci. Thy words, at once sublime and frank, convince me That thou esteemest me no vulgar foe. Ah! that I could ... So. I've said enough.âNow, Syphax, We should withdraw ... Sy. Soon will I follow thee ... So. No, no; henceforward will I never quit thee. Sy. And yet thou should'st abandon me ... So. I will not; And this resolve in mighty Scipio's presence I with an oath confirm.âAh, come with me: From the so many black and horrible storms That now assail us, may a transient respite At least be granted. I, although a woman, Have hitherto by force restrain'd my tears: Oh Scipio, 'tis impossible to weep When thou art present: but imperious Nature At length will have her tribute. 'Tis the part Of fortitude to bear adversity; But not to feel its pressure when it comes, Rather implies stupidity than strength. Sy. Ah wretched me! Why have I lived so long? ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Sci. This is a noble woman: worthy she To be a Roman.âI scarce check my tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Masinissa, Numidian Soldiers. Ma. Let all, obeying my commands, at night Be ready with their steeds: and silently Let them, oh Boccar, ambush where I told thee.â Faithful Guludda, thou, at all events, Meanwhile be ready with the fatal bowl. Of every monarch 'tis the sole resource Who would become the friend or enemy Of execrable Rome.âGo hence; and let Nothing of this transpire. SCENE THE SECOND. Masinissa. Ma. Oh Masinissa, Should'st thou stoop, to defend thy rights, to art? ... Ne'er for myself would I do this; but I Should place in safety whom I've placed in danger, Or perish with her.âDo I in this place, With difficulty, a brief audience gain? ... Oh heaven! is she then absolutely changed? ... But see, she comes ... I tremble ... SCENE THE THIRD. Sophonisba, Masinissa. So. I expected No more to see thee; and in truth I ought not; But (when thou hear'st it, canst thou trust my words?) Syphax himself enjoin'd it ... Ma. Influenced By scorn or pity? So. 'Twas magnanimous; And 'tis sufficient to awake in us A noble emulation. He himself Would fain converse with thee: but he commands That I precede him. And that ... Ma. Can I bear A sight like this? ... So. Art thou less great than he? Fears he thy presence? Ma. Nor can I tell thee first? ... So. What canst thou tell me that I ought to hear? Ma. In vain dost thou inflict on me new torments: I would inform thee that I here enticed thee, And that I would, at all events, myself Drag thee from hence. So. I gave myself to thee, Thou knowest it; from thee I take myself. A lofty duty, fatal to myself, Demands this sacrifice. I feel assured, By following Syphax, to withdraw myself From every ill. Do thou then now from me Learn to be strong. This is the camp of Rome: Scipio is station'd here; a monarch, thou Art station'd here: and I am station'd here Asdrubal's daughter: tell me, would'st thou now That we be govern'd by a vulgar love? Ma. Ah! with a flame far different to thine My bosom is consumed ... In thee alone I place my fame, my glory, and my greatness ... Thou should'st be mine; although my kingdom perish, The whole world perish, ... mine thou shalt be. I Perils and losses neither know nor fear. I am prepared for all, except to lose thee; And sooner ... So. Thou with having all my heart, Ah be thou satisfied ... Prove not thyself Of this unworthy ... But, what do I say? The sight, the sight alone of Syphax, powerless, Vanquish'd, and captive, yet serene and firm, Will of itself restore to thee thy reason. Ma. ... Ah wretched me! ... Could I at least alone! ... But I am not less generous than you; I am indeed far different as a lover: And I prepare to yield to you of this A memorable proof ... So. See, here is Syphax. Ma. He too may hear me; nor will you have then Courage to scorn me. SCENE THE FOURTH. Syphax, Sophonisba, Masinissa. Ma. Now before thine eyes, Syphax, thy mortal foe presents himself. But thou beholdest him in such a state, That he no more thy indignation merits. Sy. All indignation from a king in chains Would be ridiculous. If before me My rival formerly had been presented, While I possess'd a sword, I might have then Display'd to him no inefficient rage: Now cruel fate hath nothing left to me But a firm visage and impassive heart. Hence shalt thou hear me speak to thee with mildness. Ma. My desperate and immeasurable grief Should be to thee no unimportant solace: Then learn what that grief is.âSee me: I am Far more enchain'd than thou art, far more vanquish'd, More stripp'd of judgment, and far less a king. Thou tookest formerly my realm; but then Thou wert not, as thou'rt now, my conqueror; An indefatigable foe, more fierce, More ardent, always I arose again From my defeats; till I alternately Became a conqueror, regain'd my own, And took from thee thy realm.âBut thou exult, Triumph; this sublime lady yields to thee, Whom thou hast twice from Masinissa snatch'd, Entire superiority o'er me. So. And wouldest thou that I indeed should blush At thy weak courage? ... Ma. I've not yet given Proof of my courage to you: 'twill at least Keep pace with my despair.âYou are, I see, Both by premeditated death sustain'd. Worthy of both is this resolve; and I Feel its âsublime attractionâ much as others. And to each one of you 'tis suitable, Singly consider'd. Thou, a fetter'd king, Longer wilt not, nor oughtest, to exist. Thou art determined, thou, the wife of Syphax, Daughter of Asdrubal, before all Rome To shew a lofty and intrepid spirit: Nor art thou sway'd by any impulses Save those of rage and hate.âBut how can Syphax, He who adores thee, who hath been impell'd To his entire destruction for thy sake, And thy sake only; he who doth possess No less an ardent than a noble heart, Oh heaven! ah how ... how can he bear to hear That his beloved lady is to perish? ... So. And could he, even if he would, divert Me from my duty? Sy. Whence canst thou thus know My thoughts? Ma. I, by far different furies sway'd, I cannot now from thee conceal my own; Nor will I change them, except first I die! At all risks I wish Sophonisba safe, And she (I understand) will not be saved, Cannot be saved, if Syphax also is not.â Already my Numidians are accoutred: If at the gathering of the shades of night Thou, Syphax, to be one of these wilt feign, I swear to thee to be thy guide myself, And, with thy Sophonisba, to conduct thee, Unhurt and unassail'd, e'en to the gates Of your beloved Carthage. There may'st thou Collect arms, steeds, and troops; for while a king Retains his freedom, he is yet unconquer'd. I will abandon Rome's abhorred banners, And I for Carthage and our Africa, And for thyself perchance, will henceforth fight. Whenever thou shalt have regain'd thy realm And sovereign sway, so that, as king with king, We to the trial of the sword may come, I then will claim of thee with this my sword This most beloved woman, whom I now To thee surrender for no other cause Than to avert from her an immature And undeserving death. So. Thou fruitlessly Proposest an impracticable scheme ... Sy. His language intimates a lofty heart; Me he offends not; nay, he does impel me Another, and more certain, means to offer, Easier for him, and less unworthy Syphax; And 'tis ... Ma. You, by adversity subdued, Deem that impracticable which to me Would be most easy; but, if honour prompt you, Dare and attempt with me. Always at hand Is death, the last and certain remedy; To men of courage he is always present: But indispensable to all of us He is not yet. Not till to-morrow's dawn Deluded Scipio of our flight will hear: Just as he is, and in his heart humane, My rights he may respect; at all events, Thanks to our fleet-hoof'd steeds, by break of day We shall have pass'd pursuit. If any one Should make the attempt to follow us, I swear That I would rather e'en in Scipio's breast Immerge my sword, than ever yield you to him. This sword of mine, which hath so many times Already saved me; this, whence I regain'd Not only my own realm but that of others, Will that suffice not to place both of you In Carthage safe? Now, for a brief while, yield, Oh Syphax, yield to fortune: finally, Yet may'st thou fly from hence; nor wilt thou be To me at all indebted. Foes we were, And foes once more we shortly may become: The danger of an object loved alike By both of us, 'tis this, and this alone, That silences our hatred and revenge. Hear me address thee suppliantly; in thee Is thy deliverance placed. But yet, if cruel Thou dost, e'en more than thou dost love thy wife, Detest thy foe, oh wreak on him, I pray thee, Before thy death, a plenary revenge. Behold my naked sword; plunge it in me.â Kill me or follow me. Sy. Oh Masinissa! ... Amid the turbulence of thy intense And passionate ferocity, a ray Of hope yet shines to thee; thou art not conquer'd, Nor powerless, nor a captive: thence thou seest Human affairs with other eyes than mine. But in my heart there is conceal'd, beneath A brow of undisturb'd serenity, In my sad heart, more agonized than thine, There is conceal'd such a tormenting flame, Such grief, such desolation, and such rage, That language fails to represent my anguish. ... Yes, my distraction never can be known To one, who loving, is beloved again ... Ah, so much is my agony more fierce, Inflicted by the asps of jealousy, As I see Sophonisba more intent The affections of her lacerated heart Magnanimously to hide. To a severe, But to a worthy conflict, I'm impell'd By her unvanquish'd courage.âJealous rage, Ambition, vengeance, all my furies yield To love alone.âNow more than half the knot Already is unloosed. Listen to me, Oh lady. I love thee, for thy sake only, Nor for myself: hence had I, as a spouse, Rather myself resign thee to another, Than for my sake behold thee die in vain. So. What do I hear? ... What dar'st thou say to me? ... Sy. I hope that thou wilt hear thy consort's prayers; And where his prayers suffice not, wilt obey His last commands.âThe wife of Masinissa Thou hither camest ... I restore thee now To Masinissa, wife. So. Ah! no ... Sy. Oh thou Who could'st protect her when she was not thine, Now that I've made her thine, wilt do it better.â Farewell for ever. To pursue my steps Let none of you presume. SCENE THE FIFTH. Masinissa, Sophonisba. So. No power on earth Shall now prevent me from pursuing thee.â Farewell, ah Masinissa! SCENE THE SIXTH. Masinissa. Ma. Oh despair! ... Brief is the time: ... both of them would forestall me ... I only fear to be less swift than they.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Scipo, Centurions. Sci. Already I know all. Let each of you Watch as the guardians of the Roman tents During the approaching night: but I give An express order to you, that you should Abstain with care from vexing the Numidians With obstacles or insults. Go from hence; Let all things pass in quietness. SCENE THE SECOND. Scipio. Sci. Thy rage Thou should'st have wreak'd against my breast alone, Ungrateful Masinissa; or on me Its violence, like billows on a rock, Should have been broken.âBut confused he bears His wavering steps towards me; perchance he knows The destiny of Syphax ... How I feel Pity for him!âAh! come to me; ah come! ... SCENE THE THIRD. Scipio, Masinissa, Numidian Soldiers at a distance. Ma. Here, oh Guludda, wait for me.âPrepared I was not for this meeting. Sci. What, would'st thou Avoid me? I am evermore thy Scipio: Thou now in vain seekest thyself elsewhere; I only can restore thee to thyself. Ma. I was bereft of reason on that day In which I made with you a guilty traffic Of life and honour for degrading chains. But for this step perchance I yet may make The due atonement; and 'twill be sublime. Then wilt thou see that I have perfectly Regain'd my reason. Sci. I've already told thee, Thou may'st, oh Masinissa, yet destroy me: But while I breathe thou art constrain'd to hear me. Ma. Time fails me now for this ... Sci. Time fails thee now! But what dost thou expect? Thy stratagems Divulged to me are all: clandestinely Armed and accoutred, thy Numidians stand Within their tents; thou hast resolved from hence To rescue Syphax, and with him ... Ma. If thou Already know'st so much; if the base arts Of a tyrannical spy have so far urged thee, That thou hast purchased those who would betray me E'en 'mong my troops, to consummate thy task Add force to stratagem, since thou canst boast More soldiers than myself. Thou seest me Always prepared to die; never to change. Sci. Thou wrongest Scipio, and he pardons thee. Towards thee no other weapon will I use Than that of truth; with that will I subdue thee. Thy Sophonisba, who loves thee so much, (Would'st thou believe it?) she herself erewhile Fully revealed to me thy stratagems ... Ma. What do I hear? Oh heaven! ... Sci. I swear to thee, Oh Masinissa, that I speak the truth. Erewhile, by his express command, she was Refused admittance to the tent of Syphax; Hence, stung to agony by rage and grief, All thy designs to me did she divulge. But she divulged in vain: thou hast the power Still, if thou wilt, to rescue her from hence. Carthage in thee her champion may possess; I interdict it not: the injury On me alone will fall; on me alone, Who, at one stroke, my fame, my friend shall lose. But ah! may heaven avert, that finally Greater calamities o'erwhelm thee not. Ma. She! ... Sophonisba! ... For thy sake betray My interest! ... 'Tis incredible. From whence ... Sci. She, far superior to her destiny, Intends to give thee other proofs of love. To stern necessity the loftiest yield: The last and desperate resolve of Syphax Gives to her noble heart a strong incentive. Ma. What meanest thou by these ambiguous words? ... Of what proof speakest thou? ... Of what resolve Of Syphax? ... Sci. What! dost thou not know it? Scarce Was Syphax in his tent arrived, than swift As lightning, on the sword of the centurion, That as a guard was station'd there, he rush'd; The hilt he planted on the earth, and fell, Collecting all his might, upon the blade ... Ma. Oh blest, thrice blest is he! Thus is he freed. From execrable Rome ... Sci. With his last breath He order'd that admission there should be To Sophonisba forcibly denied. Ma. And she ... Ah, now I clearly comprehend The horror of her state! But oh, too far Is mine remote from Syphax' destiny! Conquer'd by thee, by his own hand he fell: I, not as yet subdued, would be destroyed By a Roman sword, but by that sword in fight. Sci. Ah no! thou oughtest not like them to perish. Rather than death, and worthier of thyself, Sublimer fortitude thy life would shew. Ma. Live without her! ... I have not power to do it ... Cannot I rescue her by any means? ... I will yet see her only once more. Sci. Ah! Assuredly her converse may avail, More than I can avail, to re-excite Its noble impulses within thy breast.â Behold her; 'tis her wish to plant herself Near to my tent. Before the eyes of Rome, And in the presence of all Africa, She wishes to fulfil each cruel duty. Hear her; with her I leave thee: Scipio In both of you confides; thou canst not bear Her to surpass thee in sublimity. SCENE THE FOURTH. Sophonisba, Scipio, Masinissa. So. Ah! pause, oh Scipio. I repair'd to thee; And me dost thou avoid? Sci. A sacred duty Enjoins that I prepare for the dead king A splendid funeral pile ... So. Hither at least, I pray thee, soon return. This will henceforth Be my perpetual dwelling place; and here I swear to wait for thee. SCENE THE FIFTH. Sophonisba, Masinissa. Ma. Perfidious lady! And dost thou also to inhuman pride Add treachery? So. Treachery! Ma. Treachery, yes; while I Prepare to save you, or to die for you, Thyself revealest my design to Scipio. So. âSyphax allowed me not to die with him. Ma. He wish'd thee safe with me. So. Already he His freedom had regain'd; that which I seek, And shall obtain.âI cannot, if my fame I would not forfeit, from the Roman camp Withdraw myself with thee. With a true love Too much thou lovest and hast loved me, That I should save myself at such a risk: I am too worthy of thy tenderness, E'er to allow thee to do this. I have, In making manifest thy purposes, Taken nought from thee but the fatal power My honour and thy glory to betray. Ma. Thou art deceived; nought hast thou taken from me. Yet I may all achieve: rivers of blood I yet may shed: all mine I will pour out Ere I leave thee a slave! ... So. Am I a slave? Such dost thou now account me? Ma. In the power Of Rome art thou. So. Of Rome! As yet I am In my own power; or in thy power, if thou Feel'st for me yet the pity of a king. Ma. Thou mak'st me tremble ... on thy countenance I see a horrible security, The harbinger of voluntary death ... But I would lead thee ... So. All, all will be vain: There is no force on earth that can avail To counteract my will, which is in me The child of duty. Indispensable, Immutable, impending, is my death, And 'twill, I hope, be free; although I am Of all things destitute; although I left In Cirta, inadvertently, the last, The only friend of subjugated kings, My faithful poison; from my lover's lips Although I heard a sacred solemn oath, That he would wrest me from the hands of Rome; ... An oath committed to the vagrant winds. Amid these haughty eagles yet a queen, Daughter of Asdrubal, no less secure, No less collected in myself I stand Than if in Carthage, or within my palace.â But thou, thou speakest not. ... Distracted looks, Swimming with tears, thou fixest on the ground. ... Ah! trust me, my affliction equals thine ... Ma. The effect of each is different: destitute Of courage, weaker than the weakest woman, Trembling I stand; while thou ... So. The state of each May be dissimilar: not so our hearts ... Believe my words: although I do not weep, I feel my bosom rack'd with agony: I am a woman; nor make I parade Of virile courage: but there doth remain No path for me to take save that of death. If I had loved thee less, I might perchance Have been the partner of thy flight to Carthage; And, at the price of my renown, have gain'd A short-lived vengeance, with thy troops, o'er Rome: But I would not expose thee, for my sake, To an unprofitable risk. The fall Of Carthage is inevitable now: Ill can a corrupt and discordant city Cope with united and harmonious Rome. I should have lived too long if I had seen, On my account, my country overwhelm'd, And thee with it hurl'd headlong to destruction. Faithful remain to Rome; continue still A grateful friend to mighty Scipio. To raise thee to great power, to give thy virtues An ample scope for action, all this now My death can do, and nothing but my death. Thy good, e'en more than mine, to this compels me ... Ma. Dost count me then so vile as to expect That I should struggle to survive thy death? So. I wish thee to excel me: and to prove Thy brighter excellence thou should'st survive; And in the name of thy renown do I Enjoin thee to do this. To thee would death Be a disgrace; for to it love alone Could prompt thee: life were a disgrace to me, Since love alone could force me to endure it. My death, thou know'st, is indispensable; To me thou swaredst it; and such a gift Would yet be grateful to me from thy hands: Not by refusing it canst thou avert My settled purpose. In this very place, Before the camp, immoveable and mute, Yet three more days, which I shall add to this, In which I have not slaked my burning thirst E'en with a draught of water, will give me Entire ascendency o'er Rome. But ah! Is there compassion in thee, thus to leave me To a protracted agonizing death, When thou hadst promised to procure me one Both brief and dignified ... Fool that I was! Trusting in thee alone, I hither came ... Ma. Thou on our death hast then resolved? ... So. On mine. If madly thou, against my express will, Turnest thy arms against thyself, now hear A furious threat, and if thou dare, defy it; I will be dragg'd a living slave to Rome, And will ascribe to thee my infamy ... Ere the return of Scipio, I conjure thee, Restore me, thou, to perfect liberty; If thou art not forsworn. Ma. What dost thou ask? ... Oh Heaven! ... I cannot arm thee with my sword ... Thy dubious aim ... So. The sword requires, 'tis true, A hand accustomed to its management. A bowl of speedy and effective poison Were more adapted to my female courage. I see not far from hence thy faithful son Guludda; for thy sake he always bears it; Call him; I am resolved. Ma. Oh day of woe!â Give me that bowl, Guludda.âNow go thou Wait for me at my tent.âAnd is this then, Is this at once the first and latest pledge Of my unbounded love, which thou would'st wrest By force from me? ... Too certainly I see That thou on no terms will consent to live; And to a long and agonizing death I cannot leave thee.âI will not shed tears, ... Because thou weepest not: behold, to thee The deadly potion I present myself With tearless eyes ... but only on condition, That in its contents I shall have my share ... So. Yes, thou shalt have it, as thou meritest. Now of my lofty love at length thou'rt worthy. Give me the bowl. Ma. Oh Heaven! ... Hand and heart I tremble ... So. Why delay? Ere Scipio comes The deed must be accomplish'd ... Ma. Take the bowl. Alas! What have I done? Oh agony! ... So. I've quaff'd it to the dregs: I see already Scipio returns. Ma. Dost thou deceive me thus? I have a sword remaining yet; and I Will follow thee. He is about to stab himself; Scipio, strenuously holding back his arm, prevents his doing it. SCENE THE SIXTH. Scipio, Masinissa, Sophonisba. Sci. Ah no! While I have breath ... Ma. Ah traitor! In thy bosom I will then Take vengeance for that immolated lady. Sci. Behold my breast defenceless: I will loose, That I may be thy victim, thy right-hand; Except for this, in vain thou wishest it. So. Oh Masinissa, if thou dar'st, I hate thee ... Sci. Me, me alone, thy hand may immolate; But, while I live, thou shalt not turn thy sword Against thy own breast. Ma. âI am once more myself.â Scipio, of all hast thou bereft me now, E'en to my sense of honour. So. Thankless man! ... Canst thou calumniate Scipio? He grants me, As he has granted Syphax, a free death; While perhaps he might have interdicted it: By dint of force he wrests thee from the shame Of an effeminate opprobrious death: And darest thou, ungrateful, darest thou Calumniate Scipio? Yield, ah yield to him! He is at once thy brother, father, friend. Ma. Now leave me: thou in vain dost check my rage. Death ... death ... I yet ... So. Ah Scipio ... leave him not: Out of my sight elsewhere drag him by force: He was born great, and thy sublime example To greatness may restore him: from the world, From Rome, conceal his weakness ... I ... already ... Feel my tongue palsied ... and my blood congeal'd ... To him I give not ... not to rend his heart ... The last farewell.âAh drag him hence ... I pray thee; And me ... leave me to die, ... as ought to die Asdrubal's daughter ... in the ... Roman camp. Ma. Ah! ... By despair ... by grief ... I am bereft Of all my strength ... I scarce can breathe ... much less Inflict ... a blow ... Sci. Come; I will use towards thee The violence of a friend. Dragging him forcibly towards the tents. I will not leave thee ... Nor ever shall thy grief destroy thy life, If with thyself thou do not slay thy Scipio.</field>
