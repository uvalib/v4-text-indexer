      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE Our Author sayes, as growing Things haue sence, Spirit, and Vigor, from high Influence; And at the first Life entertaine a Fate, Which some vncertaine Starrs doe propagate; Soe this his harmeles Yssue (ere it haue Fullie a Beeing) may find out a Graue; And not liue so long to lament the State, Of its now Birth, which if you Calculate Shall meete a better hope, you know the rude, Guiddy, and Brain sick Times, vicissitude, How hard it is to hitt right? 'Tis a sad And Fatall hower, if all pertakes of Bad: Nor can wee thinke the Planetts euer stood Soe at a Birth, to make, one, onely good. Allow it Good with the Good, and lett it bee Bad with the Bad; 'tis no ill Destinie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS PRIMVS SCÆNA PRIMA [In the Neighbourhood of Pavia.] Enter two SOVLDIERS running. ANDRVCHO meetes them. 1[tt Soldier.] All's lost! the day is lost! the Enemie Persues with winged speed. 2[nd Sold.]. Lett's seeke for safetie! Exeunt. Andru. Then run out of your selues, for while yee carry That trembling Coward (feare) along with yee, It is the greater Enemie. Enter 2 SOVLDIERS more. 3[rd Sold.]. The Cannon— Andru. Bounce! 3[rd Sold.]. And the Carriages— Andru. Your nimble leggs! 3[rd Sold.]. Are all possest by th'Enemie. Andru. You lye, For you are running from 'em. 4[th Sold.]. Where's the Generall? Exeunt. Andru. Sick a' the same disease! The running gout Be your good speed, or running Pox. What wildnes Clad in a Sheepskin-feare doth scatter thus This flock of fooles? It is lesse difficult To recollect the leaues, that Autumne stormes Haue shatter'd from their Bowghs, and make 'em grow To a fresh strength, then bring to any Head This now diuided Multitude. Enter ISEAS. Ise. Andrucho! Shift for thy selfe; the Generall's left the feild. Andru. It is a generall fault: soe you doe all. But Iseas! Iseas! prithe, if thy Bloud Be not all quick siluer, lett mee stop thee. Why In name of Madnes hast yee so? The Enemie Is not within a League, and wee are now Closse by the Cittie walls! Lett's breath awhile— What think'st thou of my lord the Generall? Is't not a prittie, hansome, fine, soft youth, In a faire ladies Chamber? Ise. Faith, Andrucho, I ha' no mind to be whipt yett. Andru. There's a freedome That's giuen to fooles and Madmen, and they may Speake truth without exception: do'st thou not Perticipate of one of those? Ise. Ye, Mongrill, Because the King and Generall giue you leaue To snarle before them you will snap at mee, now. Andru. Come, come, the world's compos'd of nothing elce, But fooles and Madmen; search the volume of it, Turne most mens Actions ouer, and who finds 'em Free from that Antique Character, deserues To bee inrol'd himselfe. Ha, ha, he! Ise. Why dost thou laugh? Andru. At the strange Changes, Sirha, In the World's Measure. Fortunes wheele runs round, Now vp, now downe; now like a curst wife, readie To strike her husband, and then presently, Humbles her selfe to 's man. We put a glosse On our Deformities, like a painted baud, And are not what wee seeme; all are disguiz'd, And each man rather represents what's fitt He should bee, then what Really hee is. Take the seuere and sterne Judge from the Bench, And he'le lay by his grauitie with his gowne; The faire and mistique Modestie that dwells In female out side, is but borrowed forme; And which of vs can find a breast that's noble But by that splendor from its slaues? 'tis hard To know a knight from a begger, or a Bankrupt From a Rich marchant. Ise. How can this be helpt? Andru. Is there no way to vncase the Hypocrite? Why euery Nation's knowne by's clothes—I am A Switzer. Ise. But how honest— Andru. True! that wo'd be knowne, But 'tis impossible, man is not made Of Christall, to be lookt through; therefore who trusts Vpon his worlds vncertaineties, must needs Be fooles, or Madmen; and who do's not soe? Why should you take exceptions then? but stay— The King and Generall— [Enter] KING, TIMENTES, ANTHARIS, CLEPHIS, ASPRANDVS, Gard. King. Lett the scatter'd troopes Be putt in order, and our gards redoubled. Beaten thus basely! shall the warlike Lombards, That haue not onely aw'd proud Italye, But all the Neighboring World, now turne their backs To the Raueneans, a contemned People? [To Asprandus]. See that the Scouts vpon the least aproach Bring vs intelligence. [Exit ASPRANDVS]. [To Timentes]. What aduantage gain'd they That you were broken thus? Tim. (speakes fearefully). The battailes ioyning— Our wings aduanct— Andru. And flew away. Tim. But being— Opprest with multitudes— Andru. Of Feares. Tim. Retir'd— In this disorder— Andru. Hee's not yett recouer'd. [To the King]. My lord the King! the Enemie! the Enemie! King. Where? how farr of? Andru. Heere, by the Generalls speach, Heere at our backs; how could his feares be fresh elce? King. Barke not, good Bandog, 'tis not tyme to bite now; Wee are more serious. Tim. [to Andrucho]. Sira, I'le musle yee. Andru. Get naked Truth a coate, doe! Had I come With the smooth tougne of oyly flattery. And prais'd his lordships valor; how hee stood The shock of the feirce foe, till Numbers, rather Then Noblenes did gett the day; or laid The imputation on the Starrs that were not Propitious, I should perhapps haue gain'd The next Command. Vice is vnconfident; Her face must be dawb'd ore. [To Timentes] My lord, you are Valiant— King. Take this foole-hardy fellow hence. Anth. [to Andrucho]. Away— You are to sawcy— Andru. For a Courtier. But a good honest plaine blunt Souldier May speake his mind. This peece of Rottennes (Scarce sound at Hart) is now the cheifest Pile The king doth build on; we are like to thriue well! (Antharis whispers with ye king). O how the serpents wriggles into's breast! So so, spitt out thy venome there! How finely Are those that listen vnto flatterie, Tickled to their distruction? Ise. Peace, good waspe— Andru. Not while I haue a stinge. Ise. Sfoot, I wonder How thou darest speake so boldly; if such words Should scape my tougne, I sho'd be made to swollow 'em, Spight a' my teeth. Andru. I think so too; for may The Asse be so familiar with his master, As the neat Greyhound? Ise. You will still be pinching. Andru. Yes! for heere's game enough— Anth. [to the King]. 'Tis Chance, my leige, In warr beares cheifest sway; lett him againe Venture abroad: new howers begett new fortunes. King. It shall be so! Timentes, thou shalt trie Once more what fate will doe, and on her wings Build our vncertaine hopes. The Virgins shall Besprinckle 'em with teares, and the graue Matrons, With prayers, and sighs, shall heaue 'em vp, vntill They houer ouer thee; while the sad edge Of their eternall Destinie shall turne Vpon our foes. Be not discouraged, Thou hast our fauor still. Tim. Then arm'd with that, I Will proceed as boldly through danger As that great Macedonian, when his fortune Bred an oppinion in him, that hee was Descended from the Gods. 'Tis not Men, now, Or Numbers that I value; wo'd there were Some Powers aboue Men to incounter with, That I might make my Valor speake my fortune, More then my fortune, that. The Souldiers bloods Burne with Reuenge, and I am all a flame; Myne Eyes shall now dart lightning, and my tougne Speake thunder to 'em: what this Arme shall doe! Fames trumpett shall put Enuies spight to silence. Me thinkes I feele the Body sturr, and call For some braue head to lead them on. Antha. Well spoken. Andru. I wo'd it were as well done. Who wo'd thinke This fellow were not Valiant? Heer's the Signe Of Hercules, but some poore female Spirit Inhabitts it. O how the Man wo'd walke Without a soule, if hee should vent his Valor In action, not in words! Tim. Lett vs aduance To meet this proud foe. Now their Ruine falls Heauy, and greiuous, when it comes in midst Of all their Triumphs: And the Parcœ shall Wonder what Power doth antidate, what they Wo'd lengthen out. Andru. Oh! they are dead alreadie! Ise. Wee shall not neede to fight. King. All my best wishes Shall goe along with thee. Clep. [to the King]. You are my Soueraigne! And lett not wild Opinion sway your Judgement. I speake as if I ment to loose a life To giue you Beeing. I co'd neuer sooth! And Councell crosse to Princes oft rebounds, And strikes those men that aym'd it; y'had a father That cherisht Vertue— King. Whether tends this bouldnes? Clep. To tell yee, that you haue distroid the strength, And saftie of your Kingdome; buried aliue Those that knew how to act, more then to speake; Banisht the Prime of your Nobillitie; Through Discontents made 'em retire, and rais'd Such as dare onely fight in words. How can Your Armies thriue? The Souldiers are growne hartles, And where there is a Spirit, 'tis vented out In such strange murmurings as might corrupt The best obedience. This I am bound to tell yee. Andru. [aside]. And nobly spoken! Clep. [to Timentes]. Nay, Sir, neuer stare! Wo'd you durst venture on the foe as boldly As I dare speake truth! King. You presume to much Vpon our Patience. Clep. Sir, my zeale for you Is the strong motiue. If you meane to bury The memorie of your braue Ancestors In black Obliuion, send this fellow forth. But if you striue to add vnto the height Of all their glories, lett your fauors shine Vpon Arioldus, whome your angry frownes Haue driuen to a priuate life; ther's a sparke hidd In the cold asshes of Neglect: hee knowes How to command an hoast abroad, aswell As to obay at home. Andru. [aside]. How I co'd hug thee Thou good old man! Clep. Fortune that crownes your actions Will neuer bring a Garland to your Vertues, By such weake meanes as that. King. Now I haue heard yee, And find a crosse opinion to my will Hath, onely, lett your tougne loose. Who am I? Am I your king? Why thus controul'd? how dare you Venture vpon my anger? Who is here Mutters a word more? Andru. [aside]. I must steale away I shall burst out elce. Exit. ANDRV. King. Euery priuate man Is master of his famely, and there Commands, and is obay'd: are Princes tyed To strickter Rules? There is no Difference As, being men, wee are one Species, And that which onely makes vs kings, is Power: And will yee tye vp that? I haue not found Myne anger yett: be dumb or— [Reenter] ASPRANDVS. What's ye newes? Aspr. The Enemie with speed marches this way, And throwes his feares before him, which do seaze The benum'd Sences of the Multitude, So that it conquers more then slaughter can. King. They shalbe stopt; wee'le meet 'em. Aspra. But the Souldiers, Busied with feare that the now Generall Should lead them on, more then the Enemies fortune, (As if they had one mouth) call for Arioldus, Braue Arioldus, and brand lord Timentes With the base name of Cowardize; they vowe Neuer to stirr a foot without Arioldus. King. Well! we will stay this outrage. Shall a swarme Of slaues contemne our will? Antharis, see The Cittie be well garded. Clephis age Will best become it too, but moderate Your speech hereafter. Come Timentes, wee Will parlee with theise Roisters. Exeunt. Manent ANTHARIS, CLEPHIS. Antha. Yes, yes, Clephis, Your Elloquence hath carried it, the King Will fix on your aduice. Clep. I wo'd thy meaning, Vnworthy lord, had no worse End then myne. Antha. If euer had a better (Dotard). Darest thou Shape any thought whereby my anger may Haue way to a reuenge? Clep. I feare thee not. Lett guiltie men weare that pale liuerie Vntill their Crimsen be lett out by Justice. Do what thou darst! If Modestie restrain'd not, And Age, the ground of all, I sho'd breake forth In action: thou abusest a braue Prince With base and seruile fawnings, pois'nest him, With thy pernitious lipps, neuer leau'st licking Till (like an Indian Ratt) thou hast deuour'd The Bowells of his honor. Antha. And, I pray, What is your ayme, but to crosse his designes And curbe his Power? Which is the iuster course, To yeild to, or oppose my Soueraigne? But I do know your Pride; you must command. And goe without Sir. I doe heare my sonne Lookes on thy daughter with a louers Eye, I'le pluck it out then—none of thy base breed Shall euer close with myne. Clep. Thy insolence Hath worne out all my Passion; I can laugh At thy distempers, now. I hope thy sonne Hath more of goodness in him then can come From such a father; if hee did pertake Of so much villanie, I'de ha' my daughter, With all her maiden sweets, bound to the stench Of some corrupted carcasse, till they both Desolu'd one way, rather then match her soe. Antha. Out, Harpie, Viper, scum of Mankind! Clep. Doe! Raue till thy foming breath infect the Ayre; 'Tis not thy priuate hate shall crosse my Care Vnto the publike safetie. Exit CLEP. Antha. I shall fitt yee. Exit ANTHA. SCÆNA SECVNDA [A Room in the House of Arioldus.] Two SERVANTS bring in a table with bookes. ARIOLDVS followes. Seru. Come, come, dispatch, my lord wilbee heere presently. Ariol. Is the boy gon? Seru. Hee is, my lord. Ariol. Hee tooke His parting sadly, did hee not? Seru. Hee did. Exit SERVANT. Ariol. Alas, poore youth! 'twas much against his mind To leaue mee soe. ([Taking up his] Bookes.) But theise are freinds indeed! Heere we may see our selues depainted better Then by reflexion; theise vncase the soule, Rip vp the inward man, and there discouer The various Humours, Passions, Indigences, That do possesse vs. How are wee abus'd By this smooth flattering outside, train'd along Through the calme Pleasures of ye world, still climing, And neuer looking downe? O Quietnes! Thou Peacefull Paradize! Me thinks I stand Vnshaken, on some loftie Pyramed, And with my minds Eye see the world in motion. What hurrying vp and downe, what paines, what Plots For their vncertaine ends? How they doe swarme, To raile, Colloge, whisper, betray, and All In seuerall postures like so many Antiques, Heere one a murdring, there another hanging: And the Accuser, nay the Judge, as guiltie As hee that suffers. Oh world, world! I am aboue thee now. Enter ANDRVCHO. Andru. Noble Arioldus! Happie in thy retirement. Ariol. Worthy Aribert! Thou art (amongst a peruerse multitude) An honest lord still. How doth this disguise Shroud thy hard banishment? Andru. Why, well. The King Minds not such vnderlings as I present now; Besids, my haire is so o'regrowne, it hinders Any suspect. Ariol. But how dost thou keepe in? Andru. By a free fooling, and wild Carriage, I gaine vpon his humour; hee delights To haue mee bite the World; calls mee his Bandogg; And I doe lay about mee, ther's foule Matter Enough to worke on, without forcing Nature. Ariol. To much, to much, my freind: And heere I liue Out a' the World, yett in't. How mild and gentle Lookes euery thing about mee? Ther's no feare To fall beneath this; I am now without The reach of fauor or disgrace. Andru. 'Tis true. But who is borne for himselfe? Tyme spreads his wings Ouer our fates; we haue no lasting Beeing. How small a thrid is life? Why should wee prize it? 'Tis better ventur'd for our Countries safetie, Then spun out longer thus. Ariol. Right, Aribert. 'Tis not this wretched poore Rag-end of Life That I doe Cocker thus; but since wee liue Necessitated vnto Tyme, and Fate, Which well we cannot change, lett vs liue Happie. That is the Crowne Men toyle for. Who wo'd plod, And breake their morning sleepes, watch at all howers, Act any base and seruile Offices; Cringe, fawne, and Creepe; nay, more then their good names, Brand their black Consciences with horrid Crimes, But to gett Riches, which they thinke their Happines? The wily and smooth Orator wo'd be silent, The Souldier fight no more, the Laborer Sett at his ease, and bruised Mariner By dangerous rocks ne're crosse the foming Maine But to liue Happily: why should I toyle For what I haue already? I enioy it. Andru. Yett Noblenes sho'd not obscure it selfe, But show the World, that it dares stand ye brunt Of the most threatning Danger. Ariol. This I grant too, When in a free Scale euerie Action's waygh'd And not by Priuate and rash Judgments censur'd To their most Enuious Ends. Andru. Encounter with 'em. Ariol. Then I must vse their Weapon: Villanie. Noe! I will sett and smile heere, lett the men That doe desire to rise, learne to sooth Vice And imitate Deformities; I'le beare A full saile in this calmenes of my Life, Which no rude storme shall threaten. Andru. But I'le push for't. Before I'le ha' my name trod vnder foot By such wild beasts, I'le wriggle hard to sting 'em. I haue bene two yeares banisht, through the mallice Of Parasits and Rogues; and poore Eugenia, My onely daughter, (after long attempts Vrg'd by the King against her Honor) coming To find mee out, made euen account with Death. Ariol. Alas, good Ladie! Andru. I did thinke to visett The Court but for a tyme, yet hardned now, And confident, thus shapt, I may find out Which are my Enemies. But I forgett— This discourse hindred my entents; Timentes Must try the fortune of another Battaile; O 'tis a slack skind youth! The good lord Clephis Mett the kings anger for yee. Ariol. Why for mee? Andru. He stood to haue you Generall. Ariol. Indeed, Hee's truly Noble, but my thoughts are fixt Within another Orbe. [Enter] SERVANT. Ser. My lord, heer's Iseas Desires to haue accesse. Andru. I will withdrawe. [Andrucho goes behind the arras.] [Enter] ISEAS. Ise. Worthyest of Lords, my Duty, which hath sought Euer to Win vpon your Noblenes, Commands my presence, to preuent your knowledge: The King is coming hether. Ariol. Sir, I thanke yee. Ise. My seruices shall waite your lordships wishes. Exit ISE. [Reenter ANDRVCHO.] Ariol. What sho'd this meane? Andru. Some new deuice! (Knock [within.]) Agen! [Enter SERVANT.] Ser. Here is Asprandus. Ariol. Lett him haue admittance. [ANDRVCHO goes again behind the arras.] [Enter] ASPRANDVS. Aspra. If my indeauors haue not laid their hopes To grow at your feet, noblest Lord, it was More through a want of meanes then will. I'me glad To fixe on this occasion now; the Souldiers Will haue no Generall but you; the King Cannot remoue their Resolutions Neither with threats nor Promises. The Seruice, Which I haue euer vow'd you, shall hearafter Show it selfe more officious to your Goodness. Ariol. I thanke ye, Sir. Exit [ASPRANDVS]. [Reenter ANDRVCHO.] Andru. Were theise two fellowes heere, Since your Retirement? Ariol. Neuer. Andru. O they glide Still with the streame. Good Rogues! Theise are shroud simptomes Of some new alteration by their Croking; They flutter still about the Fauoritt, Where they doe build their filthy nests, and lett him Decline but ne're so little, they are gon To the next riser. [Enter SERVANT.] Seru. Heer's the lord Antharis. Andru. Hey day! hey day! more Rogues yett! [Hides again behind the arras.] [Enter] ANTHARIS. Antha. My lord, That I haue euer honor'd you, my greife For your retiring can bring silent prouffs; Which I forbeare— Andru. (within). Beleeue him not, hee lyes. Antha. And that I loue you, your owne Vertues may Confirme it strongly, hauing alwayes found Such Noblenes as would invite the best To imitation. I haue spoken for you, Made the king know your worth; that worth yt euer Did speake it selfe, lay buried in his Judgement, Till I reuiu'd it; now it doth appeare In its true lusture. Hee hath chose you Generall, (By my aduice) against the present foe; Be noble like your selfe. I come to tell yee So, to prepare your thoughts. Ariol. What you haue said Of Truth in my behalfe, my lord, I thanke yee; But for the charge of Generall, 'tis a taske Fitt for an abler man. Antha. None more deserues it. This seruice I haue added to the many, You haue, and shall command. Exit ANTH. Andru. Oh! I co'd burst! Plotts! Plotts! this Pollititian Is caught in his owne noose. Hee moue the King! What Villanie is this? The good wee haue Must come from them, the Bad, the Prince must beare; This is fine iuggling— Ariol. 'Tis so, Aribert. Who treads the Maze of the Tymes Laborynth Shall find some doubtfull wayes; my hart presages A fatall Yssue: I am loth to leaue The Quiet of this life. [Enter SERVANT.] Seru. The King, my lord. Andru. Now, I must hide indeed. Exit ANDRVCHO. [Enter] KING, CLEPHIS, Attendants. King. Cousin, I see Thy vertue, now, through all mens Eyes, and I Must chide my selfe for being blind so long. I come to rauish thee from the soft Bosome Of thy blest Peace, to manage rugged Warr; I must confesse it is the Souldiers Act; Lett not that hold thee back, I wish it too. Thy Country calls for't, and the brauing foe Growes Confident, vpon our Backwardnes; Thy Vertue must repell 'em. Doe not plead! I know thou canst say much—I ha' bene vnkind— Prithe forgiue mee. Ariol. If my Breast were Stone, This Noblenes wo'd melt mee. You haue wonne More by your goodnes, then your greatest Anger Can e're distory. Were euerie haire a life, They would be all to little to expresse A gratitude for this. King. O noble Cousin— Tyme is too quick with vs; wee must away, The Enemie approaches fast. Ariol. Hee comes But to his ruine. [To his Servant.] Bring out my good Sword. Is it not rustie? [To the King.] O Sir, you haue putt Fresh Power into mee; I ha' purg'd my selfe Of all my lazie thoughts; but that I loath To boast my Actions, I durst boldly tell yee, The Enemie this day shall feele what Power A Princes fauor can infuse into A loyall Subiects breast. King. Goe, and bee happie! Exeunt [all except CLEPHIS]. Clep. A kingdome hath sound nerues when thus they agree. Nothing doth strengthen more then Vnitie. Exit. Souldiers. [within]. Arioldus!

      <field name="fulltext">ACTVS SECVNDVS SCÆNA PRIMA [The Presence Chamber in the Palace.] ALCIDONVS solus. The name of Victorie, whose sound creates New life, and spirit to men (when betwixt hope, And feare, a desperate diffidence doth seaze 'em) Cannot be so much pleasing to my Prince, now, As thy deare name, Selina, is to mee. Selina! in whose Breast there dwells all ioyes That can be fancied. I bring others peace, But Warr to thee and to my selfe, Selina. I must not see her, much lesse speake to her, Without a fathers curse; yett wee are married, Firme as the holy Preist and loue could make vs. I see no Reason that the Parents hate Should bee entayl'd. But I forgett my busines; Where doe you wander, thoughts? Enter KING, PANOPIA, SELINA, ANTHARIS, CLEPHIS. King. Now Alcidonus! Thou bring'st good Omens with thee. Alci. Such, great Sir, As victorie can import. The Generall Wo'd not loose time to write; he bad mee hast Or he should bring the newes himselfe. King. Wee long t'imbrace him, as hee is in blood Nere to vs, so no lesse in our affection Then his Deserts doth claime. Alci. Madame, the Duty I owe vnto the sister of my King, Calls my respects to you. Pan. Thanks, Alcidonus. [Aside to Alcidonus]. Selina was all teares till thy returne, But they were onely spent to make her growe, And spring vp freshly at thy view. Alci. [aside to Panopia]. O Madame, There is a waking Dragon heere that keepes mee From this diuine fruit. [Aside to Selina]. My most deare Selina! I dare not speake to thee. Seli. [aside to Alcidonus]. Curst fate! Alci. [to Antharis]. All duty Vnto my father. Antha. [who has observed their whispering]. As you prise my fauor, Cast no affection that way— Alci. (aside). I shall burst then: For my great hart is full and I must vent it. [Aside to Selina]. O my Selina, wo'd my thoughts had wings, That they might fly to thee, or actiue Sence, That I might send 'em through myne Eyes. Seli. [aside to Alcidonus]. Be silent; Wee'le liue like tirtles and mourne out our loues, Not till they leaue vs, but wee leaue to bee. Alci. [aside]. I shalbe lost if I proceede— King. [to Alcidonus]. It seemes then, The Battaile did not last long. Alci. As they ioyn'd, The Souldiers harts being full of ioy and Courage For their new Generall, could not containe, But with great Clamor cry'd out: Arioldus! As if that name should teach their swords a way Vnto Reuenge. The noise perplext the foe; For they came on, as to an Enemie, Whome losse, and feare, had weakened; and finding Such Spirit, and Vigor, would not stand the Brunt, But fled, and death did dog 'em at the heeles; Hee was so grim, and terrible, they durst not Looke in his face. Some Captiues there are taken, Some ransom'd. Here's the Generall. [Enter] ARIOLDVS, ANDRVCHO, ASPRANDVS, ISEAS. King. Arioldus! Now I will call thee myne, and without Enuie, Since thou hast done enough to make her silent. Thy name hath gotten Victories, what wo'd Thy Valor doe? Thou dost o'recome in Peace too, For in a Conflict with my selfe, I find I had the worst in loosing thee so long; But I'le recall that Truant Tyme, and pay thee My best affections now. Ariol. Great Sir, the Peace I bring you by this Victorie, is not More full of safety then I am of Sorrow That I haue done no more. If I had paid you (That which I owe) my life, I had dyed happie. There had bene then a Memorie afforded Vnto my actions, and some happely Might haue lett fall a Pitty; but to liue Where I can n'ere requite such noble fauors, It is a Misery too mighty for mee. [Kneeling]. O lett mee fall and grow heere, till I rise Worthy of your acceptance. King. Cousin, you wrong Your merritt much. Sister, here is a Jewell That I would haue you value. Pan. His owne worth Is a sufficient Plea, it makes a Way For my respects to follow. Ariol. Noble Madame, Your Vertues rather I should imitate, Beeing a rare Example, and I will; Knowing ther are no wayes to doe you seruice, But those whose Ends are good. King. Now, Iseas, And you, Asprandus, are turn'd gallant Souldiers; But my tall Switzer heere, my honest Banddog, Hee can deale blowes aswell as words. I'le loose him, And hee shall fly at all; has an old tooth, That will bite shroudly. Andru. 'Tis growne blunt a' late, Sir. King. Why, how comes that to passe? Andru. 'Tis out a' fashion. King. What? Andru. To speake Truth. 'Tis not to be indur'd. A Courtier hates it as hee hates short hose, Or a small high crown'd hatt. A Cittison (As if 'twere Poison) breakes when it appeares, For it discouers much. Ther's many a Lady, That dares not looke vpon the Light, but they Haue coulor for't. Alas! should naked Truth Appeare before them? Fye! The onely way To haue Truth seene is through a glasse. King. What glasse? Andru. An Artificiall Glasse, where euery man, Shall in his owne true Humor be presented. The Courtier at his Cringe and smile; the Statist With an erect looke, and high language, neuer Minding inferiour things; the Judge with's—Ha! Frighting the trembring Prisoner; the Crittick Shaking his emptie Noddle; and the Gallant, With some quaint oath in's mouth, smoaking his nostrills; And soe of all— King. How can this glasse be made? Andru. Th'ingredients are somewhat hard to come by. Stay! lett mee see—An ownce of Honestie, Cleare, Pure, well vitreated; with a dram or two Of Libertie, when the Signe is in Libra; With a few Braines—But whos'? A Lawers? noe They are too turbulent. A Poets? they Were fittest, but they are poore, and soone corrupted: Money do's much with 'em. A Diuines? Vmh— There is noe President for't, besids preferment Stands y' the way. A plaine blunt Swobbers wo'd, If hee had Witt enough. But—we want a Skull To make this Composition. King. I beleeue thee. Andru. Such as did liue when the Tymes durst be lookt into And then spoke Truth, and dyed in't. Clep. A shroud fellow! Hee shoots at all, and beats about the marke still. King. I loue Andrucho— Andru. I doe thanke your Maiestie. King. To heare thee talke, man. Andru. Wo'd it had bene otherwise. King. Prithe, barke still, good Dog. Andru. At whome? King. At any bodie. Andru. I cannot much condemne the Tymes: alas! Why, euery one must liue. Heere are two gentlemen [Pointing at Iseas and Asprandus]. That can obserue who rises, and who falls; Which should be flatter'd most, I pray, the faller? Ther's an necessitie they must doe one, Can a poore Courtier liue elce? Alas, noe. Why, I my selfe, a graue man, play the Buffone, To make you merry heere; is't not because I find a sweetnes in't? Wee all must liue. And ther's a whelp [points at Alcidonus] wo'd haue a Marybone, And the old dog do's keepe him from't; tis pittie; Sure, hee wo'd find much pleasure in't. [To Antharis] My lord, I am but knowne to you from the teeth outward. Antha. Yes, I doe know a knauish tougne y' your head. Andru. Ah! you are bitten, I ha' found it out now; I'le lay a Plaister on't. Cannot I talke Of soothing and base actions, but you must Apply 'em all to your selfe? If I had said, You had abus'd the King, ransackt the Country, And for your priuate ends hated all those That (for their loue to Good) crost your Designes; Or told yee, that you wrong the Princes honor, In making your Crimes, his; his Vertues, yours: This wo'd ha' bitt indeed. Antha. I'le breake thy Pate, Thou bawling Curr— All. Ha, ha, ha. Andru. The old man's angrie. King. [to Arioldus]. Cousin, Antharis is displeas'd; let's in; And after Ceremonies for the Victorie, A full Reward shall follow the Deseruer, Which thy free hand shall giue. But who can value Or sett a Rate on thine? Ariol. Your Noblenes Doth farr transend it. Exeunt [KING, PANOPIA, SELINA, ARIOLDVS]. Antha. [to Alcidonus]. Nay, come you with mee, Sir. Alci. [aside]. I shall begin to quitt the name of Dutie, And thinke, because this is vnnaturall, That I may bee soe too. Exeunt [ANTHARIS, ALCIDONVS]. Aspra. You, Swadd! Andrucho! Wee wo'd speake wi' yee. Andru. What sayes my Lip-ladds? My little Time-lings? Ise. You are still abusing vs. Aspra. Before the King, too. Art thou not affraid? Andru. Of what, my paire of Creepers? Ise. Of a Beating. Andru. Yes. As you feare soft lips, or a smooth skin, Yee nigling Ticks you; why 'tis our professions. Aspra. What, Bumbard? Andru. To obserue the tyme, yee wriglers. There is an ytching height that all do ayme at, But diuers wayes to come to't. Some by Bribes, Some by fine Plotts and tricks gett vp; and others Striue till they haue spent all and neuer reach it; Some haue a way by fooling, some by flatterie; Some both, or worse, 'tis no disparragement: Custome in follies doth not make 'em faults. Alas! wee liue not now in the Worlds Infancie, When no man could be crown'd with Honors Garland But he must passe through Vertues Temple first. Wee haue a thousand wayes now: Tymes do alter. Ise. True, but to ieast so broadly— Andru. I sho'd loose My way of fooling elce. Aspra. Well, th'art a Rogue! But, prithe, vse vs well. Andru. I will, I will. Ise. When didst thou see Timentes, the late Generall? Andru. Not lately. Ise. Now his humor's quite discouer'd. Andru. What! Aspra. Hee's so fearefull that the wind doth fright him, The Creaking of a shoe or any noise, Nay, his owne Pace; his shadow is so troublesome That he oft starts at it, and thinks it speaks to him. Andru. Lett's find him out, and ease our Spleenes vpon him. Exeunt. SCÆNA SECVNDA [The same] [Enter] TIMENTES. Tim. Who's there? Here's no body. Why am I so fearefull? I dare scarce be alone, nor yett in Companye. What's that?—O—'tis a mouse behind the hanging. And shall such small things fright thee? Fie, Timentes! Where is that noble forwardnes made the King Thinke thee sufficient to command an Army? Is it quite gon? I'le raise it vp agen, To stop the mouthes of those yt dare but say Thou art not Valiant—I hope heer's no body heares mee, I am not Quarrellsome. O—O—the King! 'Tis as I wisht. [Enter KING.] King. How now,thou peece of Cruditie, Thou bog of Man, are thy feares still in motion? Tim. Yes, Sir, that I shall neuer find him out, That hath traduc't mee to yee: I am bold enough To doe you seruice: I can tell, but— King. What? Tim. I can discouer— King. Whome? thy feares infect mee. Tim. Nay, ther's no danger in't. The dainti'st Wench! King. Where? Tim. Arioldus hath her. But you'le think I do it out of Mallice: I protest— It is the sweetest Soule! O, sh'as an Eye That like a Subtile peircing lightning strikes The inside, and leaues all the rest vntoutcht. King. It seemes the Diuell Feare giues way awhile Vnto the Diuell Lust. You'de faine be at her. Tim. Alas, not I; I do but tell your Maiesty. King. Is shee so young and fresh? Tim. Of tender yeares: And such a feature— King. I will see this Paragon. Are you so close, Arioldus? I may hap To find your Maze out, my Dedalean kinsman. But are you sure of this? Tim. Haue I my Eyes? And are they not still waking for your Seruice? Hee tooke her Captiue, and shee is a Peece Fitt for a Prince. King. Nay, I'le not hinder him. But—not a word of this more. Tim. I am dumbe, Sir. Exeunt. SCÆNA TERTIA [A Room in the House of Arioldus.] ARIOLDVS, EVRINIA. Ariol. You need no Ransome, Faire One: Such a Captiue Will take the Conqueror. But since your will is To liue conceal'd heere, till a Ransome comes, You shall make mee, and Myne, Yours. Euri. Noblest Lord, How weake is womans Power, that she must frame Her words to Rules, and all her actions to The line of Censure? I can hardly liue heere Without Reproch; yet, if my life bee honorable, And you esteeme it soe, I value not That loose Fame can report, while so much Vertue As yours protects mee. Ariol. Deare Eurinia, I'le keepe thee chary as myne Eyes; no Clouds Shall threaten thee, but I will make 'em breake Into repentant drops. I loue thy Vertue, Thy gentle modestnes, thy meekenes, Sweetness. Prithee, bedewe those pritty cheekes no more, Least the Virmilion be afraid to looke Vpon thy teares; which, yet, do serue for a foile To those pure Christalls. Euri. I haue cause, my lord, If you knew all. Ariol. I'le beare a part with thee; Throw all the Burthen of thy Cares on mee. What is't that troubles thee? Euri. I ha' lost my father; Nay more, my selfe! Ariol. How dearest? Let thy words Haue freedome to thy hart, that they may stop The currant of thyne Eyes. Come, speake it out— Greifs lessen by discouerie. Euri. My fortune, Though now deiected, can deriue it selfe From Noble Ancestors. Ariol. Thy Vertues speake it. Euri. But loue that poisons all our Happines, Prepar'd a Cup for mee. I lou'd a Gentleman, Of highest Ranke, and yet his Noblenes Was farr aboue his Quallitie. I seru'd him In habitt of a Boy, onely to gaze Vpon his Eyes, for there me thought ther dwelt A heauen of Blessings. I did pine away, For hee, good man, ne're vnderstood my Sighs; And might haue dyed vnpittied, if some freinds, With violent perswassions, had not wrought mee To reassume my Shape. And ere my suffrings Could be reueal'd, I did become your Captiue. Ariol. But where's that happie man? Euri. I thinke hee liues, But hee is lost to mee. Ariol. Wee'le find him out. Deare, lett mee know his name. Euri. Noe! ere my tougne Shall proue so great a traitor to my Breast, My greifs shall find a graue. Ariol. Truly, faire Virgin, Thy Story's full of Pitty. Thou shalt haue What freedome thou canst wish, if that will please thee, To come to thy Desires. Euri. I find no Bondage But what I bring with mee. [Enter] KING. King. Now, Arioldus! I am too sawcy with your priuacies. Ariol. Sir, you do take mee somewhat a' the soudaine. King. You haue a faire one heere—a Beauty of Price. Ariol. I neuer askt how much, but I doe prize it, When it comes clad with Vertue. King. Oh! you value The Vertue, then; I'le venture on the Beauty—(He kisses her). And 'tis a pretious one. Sure, I haue seene A hansome frame like this. Was this a Captiue? Exit EVRINIA. What! is shee gon? Cousin, you are so close To keepe all for your selfe. Ariol. Great Sir, the Duty Which I reserue for you, wo'd be suspected, If my faith should be branded with Discurtesie To Captiues, or to strangers. King. Why, your faith? Ariol. My Promise, Royall Sir, to gard her Honor: And I doe hold it sacred as the Rites Religion binds vs toe. King. O, you're in loue then. Ariol. I'me Charitable, Sir. There is a Pitty Due to her suffrings, and I loue to assist Those that are in distresse. King. A Pritty way To keepe a wench: you do't in Charity. Ariol. I know not what you meane, or if I did, I wo'd not think it, for you are my King. King. Arioldus! I must haue this wench. Ariol. If shee Puts her deare Innocence into my hands, I'le keepe it blameles, though my Blood besprinkles't. King. Are you so Valliant? Ariol. Justice, Royall Sir, Is euer confident. Shall I betray My guest, which by all hospitable Bonds I'me bound to keepe, vniniur'd? Such a guest! A tender Virgin, beaten by the rage Of a most violent fortune to take shelter Vnder my wing? And shall shee be snacht thence, Against her will, pluckt from mee? O, my tamenes. When thou dost hood thy selfe at such a sight, Maist thou ne're looke abroad more! Were there dangers, Heauy, and waighty ones, coming vpon mee, And I their Center, I wo'd beare 'em all, Rather then suffer it. King. You show your loue To her, but not to mee; a strangers power Preuailes aboue myne. I had thought, Arioldus, My fauors had bene better plact; this suits not With your large protestations. Ariol. Yes, aswell As your faire promises, when to my greife I left the quiet of a life, this Breast Shall ne're inioy agen; your words desolu'd mee, Supled my stubborne hart, then; nay, I feele The opperation yet. Would myne wo'd worke The like effects on you! Command mee something That honor may make way to, and I'le signe Th'assurance with my Blood; but thus to serue you Ignobles both. King. Faith, lett mee haue her Cusse, I'le pleasure thee another tyme; 'tis nothing; You may aswell do't! I'le not be vnthankful. Ariol. O whether wilt thou lead mee, Passion! If I should giue thee raine? Wild Sauages Whose burnt veines swell with the Meridian heat, Hold better temper. I am almost lost, Lost to Religion, Reason, all good men; Encompasse mee, some gardian Power, that I May sooner lep into a Sea of Ice, To quench myne Anger, then my Rebell hand Should strike at Maiestie! You find what Power You haue in mee, Sir. King. I'le not dally longer; Shee shall go wi' mee. Ariol. You must come through mee first; Make this your way, I'le not resist; and when This Bulworke is throwne downe, her Innocence Will raise a thousand more, which all the lust You can imploy shall neuer rase. King. You wrong mee, And falcely toe: I loue the maid. Stand by, There is no other way to shun myne Anger; For you may sooner calme the incensed waues, When the rude winds breake loose, or striue with Heauen, When a Prodigious Comett houers o're yee That threatens Ruine: I haue lost my temper; Dally not with my vengeance; by the Soule Of her thou louest most, I will come through thee elce— [Draws.] Ariol. I feare yee not. King. [making a pass at Arioldus]. Haue att thee then— [Enter] EVRINIA. Euri. [to the King]. O hold, Sir— [To Ariol.] Noble Arioldus! [To the King.] Royall Sir! fixe heere Your hungry sword; lett a poore Virgins teares Calme this lowd Tempest. [To Ariol.] 'Twas vnkindly done To venture so for mee—[To the King]. My Lord! My Lord! Are his braue actions, which are bleeding fresh In Euery Memory, quite lost in yours? O, it wo'd breake a hart of flint, to thinke That asmuch Valor as a Man can boast of Submitts it selfe to blowes.

Begin the song, Boy. SONGE So doth the early larke salute the day, So the young kids do skip and play, When the Suns cherfull beames arise, Such is the pretious Lusture of thyne Eyes; For without that delight, To mee 'tis endlesse night! By them I liue, I spring, I growe, and haue By their Ecclipses, a sad graue. When our hard Parents enterpose A World of Earthy thoughts, this light wee lose; Which doth procure great paine, Till it renewes againe. But wee will borrow from pure Loue, his fire, To kindle, and inflame Desire; That, when our Eyes meet not, wee may By that warmth thinke there is another Day; Then meeting, 'twill appeare A thousand tymes more cleare.

EPITAPH Coffin! though thou bee'st of Wood, Thou art for our Generalls good; And Honor 'tis to thee enough, That hee is made of the same Stuffe. A Block cutt out in shape, for showe, With no more Spirit then made it goe; So that it scarcly could bee sed, Whether hee were aliue or Dead.

Seli. Our Parents Cruelty giues a sad Rellish To our delights, my dearest Alcidonus. How happy were this meeting elce? Alci. Wee'le stand The shock of all their anger, thus inshrin'd; And quick feares shall, like falce Orators, Be dumbe and silent. What ther is of trouble, That in our high, and ellemented Loues, Causeth a trepidation, 'tis the sence Onely doth suffer, while that purer Spirit (Which is no part of it) with Doue-like wings Mounteth aboue their Mallice. Wee were borne Th'example of their Rigor, and wee'le beare it With a strickt Patience. Seli. But, mee thinks, 'twere better To lett 'em know the truth; the hand of Heauen, And all the Ceremoniall Rites of loue, Haue made an Vnion which they cannot seuer: 'Twill be discouer'd, and 'tis fitter wee Should do't then others. Alci. True! If the sharpe edge Of their inueterote Mallice were but blunted, Which I will striue to doe: My fathers anger Is like an Ouerflow, not to be stopt Within the Banks, before its Rage be spent; That were to turne the torrent on our selues. But this extreame hate is like our affliction, Too violent to last. Seli. Lett's make the best on't. Alci. Wee will, Selina, and in our stolne sweets, Hord vp a treasure that shall ransome all Our forepast miseries. Wee neede not Blush When our lips meet; those are the marks of guilt, And though feare borrowes 'em sometymes, 'tis but To show how nere that's to it: Our free Soules Shall not pertake of either. In theise Groues Lett each day looke vpon our loues, and as The Buds spring vp, so lett our ioyes grow stronge, The better to indure the nipping Frosts Of Seperation; Hymens torch well lighted Can neuer be extinguisht but with Death.

Heere are a paire of the most equall Harts That euer gaue a Beeing to two Bodies; Lett 'em not bee disioyn'd, wee humbly begg it, Beg it vpon our knees. See how her teares, In ouerflowing Silence, plead for her, My prayers for mee. Antha. I must not heare him speake. [To his Guard.] Take him away!—Thou disobedient Varlett! Lay hands on him! Alci. I will not bend my sword Against you, Sir; but if theise handle mee, It shalbe stiffe to them. Antha. Strike! Strike him downe!— Rebellious knaue! Alci. I am not. Heere's my sword. Your harshnes wounds mee more then can their weapons: For as two young and neighboring Mirtells leane By Naturall Simpathy, each to the other, And so perticipate, no storme can rend one But it is Death to both; such is your Anger. O lett vs gently grow vp to be yours. Antha. I am not to bee mou'd. [Enter] CLEPHIS. Clep. Ha Minion! Haue I now found your haunte? Alci. Noble lord Clephis, If you haue sence of Pitty, thinke what 'tis To part vnited Soules; for as the Mind Transcends the Body in her faculties, So the distraction's more. Bee not you cruell, too— Clep. Beleeue mee, I doe loue thy generous Nature, And I could wish thy father had a Vertue Equall to thyne, that wee might meet your wishes. But you see what hee is. Come hether, Girle; Wer't not Antharis sonne, I should commend thee For such a noble choise, and as hee is I doe not much mislike it. Antha. But I doe, Sir. Were shee a Serpent wrigling on the Earth, And cold as it, I'de rather mingle Bloods With such a one then any of thy yssue. Clep. Thy Mallice comes a'the same Broode, persue it. Antha. Yes, and I will. [To the Guard.] Why stay yee? Take him hence! Alci. I shall forgett all Rules of Goodnes—Hold! Antha. I will not heare a word more—To his Chamber— Alci. This is aboue the height of Cruelty. Exit Gard with ALCIDONVS. Clep. Come, wee'le away, too, Girle. Antha. Your Lordship may Hang vp that peece for a signe and 't may bring custome. Pray, lett mee see't with myne no more. Clep. Thou worse Then wickednes can name, but yt I loath To haue myne Anger fall on such a Wretch, I now wo'd spitt thee dead; thou know'st my Blood, Nobler then thine.

Antha. By what strange meanes? Aspra. All his liues faculties Were mastered by a soudaine fright. Antha. Is't possible? Hee was my kinsman, and I stroue to sett him In the Worlds Eye, but his feares made a Blemish, Which blinded all his Vertues. I confesse That my Ellection was not good, but fixt once, My loue's as Constant as my Hate. I'le pay My last Rites to him heere; sett downe ye Body. [Kneels and opens the coffin.] [Enter] ANDRVCHO. Andru. I ha' bene at the Court and ther's no admittance; The king's in priuate, and the publicke Mouth Giues out hee is in Loue. What Captiue's that Hee had from Arioldus? Ise. I ne'er saw her. Aspra. What's to bee done then? Andru. Hang our selues for preuention; For 'twill come out. Aspra. Then thy great Beard and Bulke Will grace the Gallowes well. Andru. I shall take it Heauily; But you two litle Pigmies will make light on't. Ise. Sfoot, 'tis no Jeasting matter. Andru. But it is A Jeasting matter was the Cause on't. Antha. [to the body of Tim.] Well! I'le doe thee this last Right, since thou art gon, That who soeuer caus'd this, with their Bloods Shall Laue thy funerall Pile. Andru. [aside to the others]. Ther's Comfort yett. Ise. [aside]. Lett's shift our selues away. Tim. My lord Antharis— Andru. Pox a' your small pipe, are you squeaking? Antha. Gentlemen! Am I to bee abus'd?

A swarme of Villaines Seaz'd on mee in the streets; some cry'd “Lett's burne him”, Some “Hang him!”, and some “Drowne him!”; nay they had mee Vp in their Armes to do't. Alas, I lay In a Cold sweat; they pincht and tumbled mee; But stirr I durst not, no, not breath[e]; I hop't now Of nothing but the easiest way to dye, Vntill I heard your voice. Andru. [aside]. Wee were fine fooles, To thinke him dead! Tim. Andrucho spoke to 'em. Andru. Wee did our best, Sir. Antha. But what Rogues were theise? Andru. Some of the cast troopes. Wee had much a'doe! Tim. I know you had. My good freinds! Antha. This is strange: Send search out after 'em. Tim. O by no meanes, Lett 'em alone, ther's danger to recall 'em. Andru. There is indeed. Antha. Well, I must hence. Tim: I'le wi' yee. Exeunt ANTHARIS TIMENTES. Andru. Pack vp your trumperie; if wee had gott a Pardon For killing this liue foole, what had wee bene? Aspra. Why little better. Ise. But is't possible Wee should be cousen'd thus? Aspra. Sfoot, I thinke We wanted all our sences. Andru.

SCÆNA TERTIA [A Room in the King 's Palace.] KING, EVRINIA. King. I lou'd a faire one once, whose fate to her Was (as her Cruelty to mee) too violent: Shee gon, thy likenes doth reuiue the Loue, But lett her Cruelty dye with her, Eurinia. Euri. I shall be cruell to my selfe, great king, If I obay you. King. Dry those fountaines vp And lett the warme drops help to heat thy blood, Which yett is all an Ice. Euri. I feele my self In equall temper, Sir. King. Thou art more cold Then frozen Scithians are, and yett thy touch Is a hott flame to mee. Euri. O how my feares Circle mee round! King. Those black and misty foggs Shalbee expel'd; the splendor of my loue Shall like a Radient Beame disperse those clouds, While in my Sphere thou rulest, and there shalt shine, The Glory of a Kingdome. Euri. This is full Of trouble to mee. King. Why dost turne away? Am I a Gorgon, sweet one? Or hath Age Printed his hollow markes within my face? Am I deform'd? The Dames of Lumbardie Call vp their Rosie coulors to their cheekes, When I but smile on 'em, to deck their Beauties. Are you, Raueneans, Enemies to Loue As well as vnto mee? 'Tis the men hate mee; The women should be gentler. Euri. I loue Vertue, Though in my greatest foe. King. 'Tis next to follie To take that word as 'tis corrupted now, When euery child of feare shall be cal'd Vertuous, That with ignoble suffring can oppose A Passion, or affection. Then spitt on mee, Vntill myne Anger boile, and lett mee beare it, That you may thinke that Coward Patience Vertue. Or lett mee vent my Loue in Sighs and Grones, Till my rackt hart doth crack agen, and call that A Vertue too; no! rather a tame Madnes. Vertue is actiue, sprightly, full of fire, Not dull and stupid. I wo'd faine perswade thee— Euri. To bee more vgly then the tougne of slander Can add a name too, or the sence of sinne In its true shape. King. Now, see how much you erre. Heere is the want of Vertue, when you are Transported thus with feare, to loose what you Wo'd be loath long to keepe, if you were vrg'd to't; How many wayes, tricks, wiles, deuices, plotts Frame yee to those wisht Ends, when once you know 'em, And blame your tardy Ignorance? This feare Doth not become thee, banish it, Eurinia; I'le teach thee how— [Offers to kiss her.] Euri. Forbeare! King. How, Maid, so coy! Euri. Yes, Sir, although my Body be a Captiues, And now in your Power, yett my mind shall neuer Be slaue vnto your lust. King. Call it not soe. I'me fruitfull in my loue; the springing flowers Oprest with morning dew, loue not the cleare, And comfortable Rayes of the Suns beames, Dearer then I doe thee. O lett mee growe For euer heere; my teares shalbe the showers, And I will waite and wish for thy lou'd Eyes To cherish mee. Euri. 'Tis but in vaine to striue, My loue is fixt already. King. Fixt! Where, pray? Euri. And 'tis no infant Loue, that like young Plants May bee remou'd and sett in an new place, But of Mature groth. I haue told my storie To Lord Arioldus. King. Yes! and I haue heard it. But can you bring my Reason to beleeue That your no hopes there can hold Competition With my high fauors? Your Pollicy Wilbe discouer'd. Is it Monye time, Or Emulation, Enuy, or Reuenge, That now raignes in yee? Euri. What d'yee meane by those, Sir? King. Why, I haue heard you women haue those fitts, And if you be ta'ne then, ther's noe Resistance. Sometymes Ambitious, and then feed that humor, One may haue any thing. Then, againe, Mallicious, Second 'em there, you haue their harts. Sometimes Soft language, and pale looks, with sighs and teares, Doth win much on 'em. At another tyme, A boistrous and rough Centaure will preuaile More then a Cupid. What's thy humor now, That I may meet it? Euri. 'Tis to bee from hence. King. No, Maid, y'are fast enough; your freind Arioldus Is shifted hence too; were hee heere, hee durst Venture assoone vpon a Raging Tiger, To steale away her young ones, as come nere thee. 'Twere better for him face a full swolne Cloud And stand the thunder of it when it breakes, Then looke vpon this sword: hee cannot help thee. Euri. [aside.] Encompasse mee, myne innocence! [To the King.] Your looks Begin to fright mee. King. 'Tis to try Conclusions I haue begun wi' yee in Loue; all offers That might induce affection were not wanting; And now my sighs are spent, my Promises Take no effect; I'le try what force can doe. Euri. O heare mee, Sir! (Kneeling.) What black and guilty Stories Shall fill your Annalls? Will you haue Posterity Record such wickednes, and with their Curses Brand your foule Soule (for all the Crimes you act Shalbee imputed thers)? You are a king, And I a Captiue stranger; will not pittie Moue your obdurate hart? Remember how My coming hether greiu'd your Noble Kinsman, And what a Conflict hee indur'd, betwixt His Duty to his Prince, and promise past To a distressed Maid: thinke but of that, And for his sake— King. Yes, yes! I know it well, You are Arioldus whore; that doth incense mee The more against thee; I must sue for what You prostitude to him. Am I lese worthy? Suruay mee well, and if thou beest not blinder Then a darke sighted Mole, such earthy thoughts Will not possesse thee long. Euri. By all the Powers That nourish goodnes, hee hath bene to mee Onely a Refuge; and I loue his Vertue, More then my life. Cutt mee in Peeces, Sir, If you be angrie, exercise your Anger, And wound mee, not myne Honor. King. I ha' bene Baffel'd toe lately by a stubborne faire One, Just such another as thou art: forsake mee All that pertakes of Man, if thou escap'st. I train'd thee purposely from Companie; Heere's none to rescue thee. Euri. Yes, I haue hands, And teeth and tougne shall fight for mee. King. Thy Cries Cannot be heard, it is in vaine to striue, Thou canst bring nothing to thee by this strugling But more contempt. Euri. Yett heare mee once agen. What will the Virgins think? What the graue Matrons? What the sad Soules of your Progenitors, When such black actions shall putt out the light Of all your Vertues? And what horrid looks Will such foule Crimes putt on to fright Repentance? King. This bates mee now as much as the warme west wind Th'intemper of the torrid Zone; bid fire To leaue his high and mounting Quallitie! Or chide prompt Nature that hath taught my blood Thus to rebell; but I'le not stand to talke—[seizes her.] Euri. Help, Help! King. [aside]. My watchword! Now they come!

Seaze mee some stupid Spirit, That what I heare and see may passe vnsensibly By my too prompt Imagination, Least that the waight of it be greater then My Reason well can beare. I dare not thinke What I am loth to know. Euri. The King's a Ravisher! Ariol. Thy lookes do speake no lesse. O what am I But a distracted peece of Earth? Where's now The Moderation dull Philosophie Soe much doth boast of? I am put to the triall, And ther's no meane in this. This Spectacle Wo'd make a frostie Patience glow, and burne, Till it looks red with fury. None t'abuse, But a poore innocent and Captiue Maid, Tost in a sea of Suffrings. Euri. I am come To take my leaue of you. Ariol. Indeed th'ast Reason; For ther's more safety among Saluages Then where such Lust raignes. Yett, I prythee, stay, That thou maist see the ruines of thyne Honor Repair'd by a Reuenge. Euri. No, I must goe Where you shall neuer find mee more. Yett, pray, Thinke sometyme of a litle Boy that seru'd you; Did you ne're see him since? Ariol. Amazement strikes mee! Euri. 'Twas I, my lord. I now am bold to tell you What I had euer purpos'd to conceale; I lou'd your Vertues, and I seru'd you truly. Wo'd I had done so still; then had I ioy'd In what I neuer more shall looke vpon! But some freinds that I trusted, vrging often What a Dishonor 'twas, neuer left working, Till they had gott mee from you; but they lookt Not with my Eyes, nor were their thoughts so harmeles; For Heauen knowes all I wisht for was to bee A seruant to your Goodnes. In the Battaile (Where you were Victor) my Prayers still went wi' yee: And when the Enemie fled, willing to heare Th'assurance of your health, I ventur'd out, And was seiz'd on by Souldiers, that did tell mee I should to Lord Arioldus. None more willing To be a Captiue there, I went with 'em, And I was truly one. But now— Ariol. Speake still, And I will stand a Liuing Statue, till Thy suffrings make mee Marble. Euri. Now, farewell, Farewell for euer. All that I desire Is but your charitable Censure; for I haue paid for my faults. Ariol. O giue mee tyme To reckon vp my greifs. Heere stands a man Exactly miserable! Was't not enough To haue a stranger Virgin (whose deare innocence Crau'd my protection) rauisht from my hands, But it must proue a freind? A freind, that lou'd mee; With such a Loue, too, as to sleight all dangers, Fortune, or Mallice could deuise. Such Beauty Obscur'd in seruile weeds! Where were my Eyes? Haue I a curse to come that can exceede this? If there bee, show it, fate. Euri. I shall but trouble yee, To tarry longer. Ariol. Lett mee loose all sence Of what thou suff'rest if I part from thee; I'le loue thee yett; there is no Recompence Can meet thy merrit elce. Euri. Oh no, my Lord; Lett some vnspotted Virgin haue a Place In your most noble thoughts; while I was soe It was a blessing Heauen denyed mee. Now I am too foule, some black and dismall Caue Shall shroud mee from your Eyes. Ariol. Thy teares will do't If thou continewst thus. I will mourne wi' thee, And euery Sigh, and drop, like the quick Minutes, Shall wast, and make our equall lines of life (Plum'd with our waighty Sorrowes) find no Rest Till they run out together. Doe not leaue mee! Euri. I know I shall but greiue your Noble Patience, Which I am loth to doe. Ariol. Thou art to mee The light of all my actions, and by thee I shall see how to mannage my Reuenge. Had I a hart as cold as feare could make it, A hand as slow to Vengeance as thy wrongs Are quick and crauing: theise disorder'd haires, And theise sad teares wo'd print mee out a way. Euri. Oh, must I add a Murther to my faults? Ariol. A Justice, iniur'd maid, which I must execute Against my Will. Wo'd my owne life wo'd serue! I willingly wo'd pay it; but I must not, That Tirant Honor sayes I must not: I Cannot subsist, vnlesse I pull a cursse Vpon my head, by Murdring of my King. Is there a man more wretched? Oh Arioldus!

The King hath sent for Arioldus, and I feare hee will preuent mee; hee is noble, And will not suffer such a Monstrous Crime To passe vnpunisht. But I'le hinder him. I shalbe lost elce; 'tis my Right. I'le borrow The shelter of this hanging. Hee hides himself. [Enter] KING, SERVANT. King. Will hee come? Ser. Hee told mee so, Sir. King. When hee enters, see Wee find no interruption. Ser. [aside.] What should this meane? Exit SERVANT. King. I haue done ill thus to abuse a stranger, Too late I find it. But are Princes wills Bounded to Rules? Yett wo'd it were vndon! But 'tis not to be helpt now. [Enter] ARIOLDVS. Arioldus, I sent to speake wi' yee. Ariol. And I am come. King. Are you so short wi' mee? Ariol. Breifnes is best. King. This was not wont to bee. There is more difference Betwixt the Parties. Ariol. A swords length or soe. But to the Purpose; I wo'd know the matter. King. What's this, Arioldus? Am I to be forc't? Ariol. I am no Rauisher! King. I can be taunted, And beare it toe. O what a Coward's Guilt? Ariol. I'me sorry, Sir, to vse such words. My Dutie, (When it was firme and not Corrupted thus) Bad mee fall downe before yee, and with Reuerence, As to the Demy-gods; but your strange actions Haue like a Cloud o'respread it, sullied all That beares that Name. I co'd mourne drops of Blood For what you haue no sence of! King. Yes, I haue. I haue consider'd all, waigh'd euery Circumstance, And find it but a scape, a heat of youth, A rash and vncollected Accident; But that which greiues mee most, is the impression That it will strike in thee. I know, I haue Done thee an Iniury; pardon it, Arioldus, I'me very sorry for't. Ariol. You co'd not vex mee With a worse torment; all the wayes of Death, All at a tyme, could not haue Rackt mee more. (Aside.) I was so hott at first to raise his anger, Hoping it wo'd take fire, that in those flames Hee might haue turn'd to ashes. Now I must Deny my King a Pardon, that hath power To take my life; or I must yeild to him, And haue the Marke of Coward, and the staine Of poore Eurinia printed in my face. What Medium is there? King. I doe find your trouble, And know your Noblenes; I'le help you out wo't, And to that purpose I did send for yee: I doe acknowledge I haue done an iniurie, And doe propose two things for satisfaction. Ariol. There is none to be giuen for this offence; Can you recall the Tyme past? and from Age Borrow a Minute? or will Nature bee Brought to her prime and Natiue Puritie While such Corruptions haue predominance? Thinke first by adding one drop to the Sea, You doe restore the flouds that are drain'd thence. No, no, it is impossible. King. Yett heare mee; You had a temper once. Ariol. But it is lost Where I shall neuer find it more; I am Just like a weather beaten Vessell, tost From Rock to rock, from Scilla to Charibdis: My Course is desperate; no saile I make In this sad storme can keepe mee vp from sinking. King. Yett heare what I will say. I haue a sister Of such vnualued Beauty, that the Price Of Kingdomes onely can make purchase of; And shee loues you, Arioldus. Ariol. Mee! King. And Dearely: I gott it out of her by chance. This Jewell Shall hang about thy Necke, and clap thy Cheeks, Fixe her transparent Eyes in thyne, vntill Your wandring Soules find an Elizium; There Reuell all your Sences, till Loues Night (Death) doth deuide you. Is not this sufficient For one poore fault? Ariol. Although my greifs distract mee I am not so much absent from my Reason But that I apprehend the height of Honor You wo'd conferr vpon mee. But in this, You add vnto my Miseries; your kindnes, I doe not wish nor looke for; 'tis like daggers To my perplexed Hart. Shoot thunder at mee, That I may answere yee in the same Mettaile; I can not meet your Loue now. King. This exchange Is not so farr from Reason. Ariol. No To sell The Honor of a Virgin (which by oth I was to keepe inuolate) at a Rate; Sett price vpon your Lust, and purchase Shame, With the sad fall of Vertue; guild my Vices, And make 'em higher for ye world to gaze at, While the foundation shalbee built vpon The Ruines of all Goodnes! Noe! I loath The painted out side of a Rotten Soule. How happy had I bene, if I had rested In the Calme Shade of a retired life, Which your hott importunity did rob mee of. My mind held strange Predictions then, and are not Those Engins now in Motion? O soft Quiet! Thou blessed bosome of Content, how farr Are guilty States from reaching thee? King. You may Find all agen by this; be sett so hye, That the sharpe tougnes of Mallice dare not reach yee. I wo'd faine buy thy Peace. Ariol. Nothing can purchase it. Mischeife is broken loose, and like the winds, From the crackt Bowells of the Earth doth rage; There is no shelter from the Tempest of it. The Empire of the World cannot redeeme The peace of my vext soule. King. Since this distasts thee, I will propound another. Ariol. 'Tis in vaine. You cannot find a Second; if my Hart In theise feirce tumults could haue wisht a Rest, It had bene there; your Sister hath a Breast Soe full of Sweetnes! But you may aswell Collect the falling Dropps the gray-eye'd Morning Payes to the Flowers, and string 'em all like Pearles T'adorne mee like a gaudy Miserie, Till I desolue with 'em; or from the Sun Snatch the high Power of Generation, Till a New Nature doth possesse vs all, And I forgett my Suffrings: Theise you may Doe sooner then repaire my Iniuries By any satisfaction. King. Thou wert euer Louing to mee, and though this 'base distemper Which lately rul'd my Blood may iustly blemish, And lay a Brand vpon a noble Nature, Yett I'le be kind to thee, and thou shalt find it; For I will meet thy wishes. Ariol. Had this onely Concern'd my selfe, were there no other motiue, No Duty should haue bene more firme, no Loue More full of Zeale; you could not think to doe That ill, I should but onely pray against, Not rashly censure; now I, giant like, Must warr 'gainst Heauen— King. Well, then, you haue Refus'd one of my offers: heare the other. The marriage of my Sister is not valued— Ariol. As any Satisfaction, I had rather Grapple with Death. King. The other is—I'le fight wi' yee. Ariol. How! King. Fight wi' yee. Therfore draw! You know I may Lay treason to your charge, for I do find yee Loaden with bad intents, and so make Justice Quitt mee of all this feare; but I doe loath it, Where I doe loue, and faine wo'd gaine a freind. Thou shalt not fight in danger neither; heere, Heere is thy Pardon if thou kil'st mee; take it! [Holds out a paper.] And now choose which you will, my Sister or mee. Quickly, resolue! What! Mute! Heere I am ready. Ariol. Some Planet strike mee! Shall I lift my hand Against such Noblenes? I am to seeke now. Oh Arioldus, thou art plung'd into A gulfe of Doubts where ther's no ground of Rest! This Goodnes ouercomes mee; I am conquer'd: Wo'd I had neuer liu'd to see this day! Where shall I hide my selfe? Shroud mee some darknes! The light of all my Reason is extinguisht; I must kill him that wo'd preserue my life, Or liue, to see a Virgin that I loue Ignobly iniur'd. King. Are you in a study? Faith, take my Sister yett. Ariol. This World I waigh not, Nor all the Pleasures in it; th'are like Bubles: Soone heere, soone gon! You take mee most— King. Come on then! Ariol. Your goodnes, Royall Sir, I wo'd be thankefull, For this great Benefitt, but cannot, if I murder him that is the Author of it. Heere, take my Sword, and life, I humbly begg it; Ridd mee of all my Sorrowes, for I am The worst compacted, and vnhappy Masse That euer had a Beeing. [Falls on his knees.] King. Come, come, Rise! Putt vp thy Sword agen, wee will renewe A firmer Freindship; it doth trouble mee, That I should call thyne Anger vp, to straine A noble Nature from its owne true beeing: Wee'le liue like twins in loue— Ariol. Where tends my thoughts? How they doe struggle in mee! Lett 'em either Be stronge enough to leaue mee without sence Of what I suffer, or Resolue on something! It must! I take the last, Sir. King. And I grant it. Ariol. Just as my Sword was sheathing, there appear'd Vnto my trouble[d] fancy, a Poore Virgin, With haires disheuel'd, crying out for Vengeance; Her teares giues Growth to an new anger in mee, And I haue quite forgott all other pitty. Now, Arme mee, Justice! King. Come, Sir. They fight. Andru. [rushing in.] Hold! King. Bold Slaue! To interrupt vs thus! Andru. Wo'd you be kil'd? Theise are fine tricks indeed! You are my King, And 'tis a Subiects Duty to preserue yee. Putt vp your swords, for shame! I'le cry out Treason And raise the Court elce. Are you weary of liuing? King. Y'are growne too saucy, Sirra. Ariol. [aside to Andru.] Aribert— King. Wee were but pra[c]tizing at foiles; this Groome Must interpose his Will. Cousin, wee'le meet Some other tyme; the Wager still shall stand Vpon the first hitt. Ariol. I'e attend your Maiestie. Exit KING. Andru. A pritty iugling! Ariol. What? Andru. To putt it of soe. Ariol. Wee were in ieast. Andru. You cannot cousen mee, That saw, and heard what past. Ariol. Then, Aribert, 'Twas fondly done. If you had sought out iniurie, Where it first grewe (in Mallice) and had prest it, Till all the Venombe had benum'd my sences It co'd not haue bene worse. You haue vndone mee. Andru. How, Arioldus? Lett a better temper Reduce your wandring Spirit; I haue preseru'd yee From Death, or Murder, or Both; bethinke your selfe, 'Twas a freinds part. Ariol. A freinds! Spight a' such freindship, To thrust mee from the way, from the smooth path, That led vnto the quiet of my hart. You may aswell call it a Charitie, To rob a thirstie Soule of that deare Moisture, His paines, and hott desires, hath brought him toe, As Tantalize mee thus. Andru. And all this sturr Is for a Captiue! Ariol. 'Tis for one, whose Breast Hath more of goodnes in it, then dull man Can apprehend. Wee search but to the outside, And on that glaring Comet cast our Wonder, Not minding what base viscuous slimy Matter It is compos'd of. But this Soule— Andru. To venture The Murder of a King for such a one, Was a strange hazard though. Ariol. Shee lou'd mee, Aribert. Andru. Soe doth the King. Ariol. You search too deepe into mee, Amd rake fresh Embers vp. Andru. Leaue of this fury And bee your selfe; remember what it is To kill a King! A King, Arioldus! That Will pale the stoutest Courage. I haue Cause, If that restrain'd mee not, and more then you. Ariol. 'Tis falce, I'le proue it soe. Drawes. Andru. You will not! Hold! Ariol. I'le do't or dye in't. I haue heard the King Pitty your Banishment, and his full meaning Is to recall you shortly; can you waigh Soe small a suffring in an equall Ballance With this poore Captiues? Ther's not the least teare Falls from her Eyes but it is worth a life. Andru. You know I haue mett danger in the worst Shape it putts on; be well aduis'd! Your Passions Are too predominant. This Captiues iniuries I haue as much cause to reuenge as you. Ariol. This is a Madnes. Andru. 'Tis not! Shee's my daughter. Ariol. Your daughter! Andru. Yes. Sheath your vnruly Sword, And turne it not against a freind. Ariol. O Aribert! I haue of late bene beaten to this wildnes. Andru. I had no sooner cast my Eyes vpon her But to my greife I knew her. Then shee told mee That after my sad Banishment, the King Renew'd his old suit, but her loue to you Made her neglect him; so shee did giue out That shee was dead, to further her disguise; Her taking Captiue, all; to much, to much, Wer't not my King. But I haue spent my time In fooling well, and I am paid for't. Ariol. Come, Wee will compare our Sorrowes, and if they Be able to be bourne, wee'le beare 'em brauely; If not, the waight must fall vpon his head Whose Lust produc't 'em. Andru. Heauen forbid! Ariol. If you Had not restrain'd mee, t'had bene done ere this. Andru. I wo'd not for the World; 'tis sacred Blood, Pretious as teares of Dying Saints; wee must Preseure 't, and leaue our Justice to the Gods. Ariol. Farewell, I'le take my course. Andru. Hee loues you too— Remember his faire Offers— Ariol. Vexe mee not. Exit. Andru. I'le follow him, and worke vpon his Goodnes. Exit. SCÆNA TERTIA [A Room in the House of Antharis.] ANTHARIS, ALCIDONVS. Antha. Come, I will giue you liberty; my Rigor Shall not oppresse ye more, for Loue restrain'd Will soone find wings to gett abroad. I'le leaue yee To your owne temper. Take your Course. Alci. My Duty Hath not deseru'd so ill, to be throwne of And made an out cast. Antha. I wo'd ha' preseru'd yee, But you are wilfull; go, go, take her, doe! Take your so Lou'd Selina, and embrace her: Pull on a Leprosie vpon your bloods Worse then the sting of Death. Alci. Why, Sir, what meane you? Antha. I meane to tell thee that which I had thought To haue lockt vp for euer. Doe you thinke I haue bene obstinate without a Cause? Could Nature haue so litle sence of goodnes, To bee so harsh but that there is a Reason? Alci. What Reason? Antha. O how loath I am to speake it, Because it is our Shame. Alci. How! Shame to mee? Antha. Yett 'tis no fault of thine. Faith, do not heare it, 'Twill bring thee discontent; leaue but this woman, And then, you neede not know it. Alci. How I burne With Expectation? Antha. Will you haue the Truth? Alci. I doe loue nothing more. Antha. Then take it. Y'are— How hard it is to come out? Alci. Doe not rack mee! Antha. If you will needs know, y'are a Bastard. Alci. How! What Monsters Yssue shall I proue to bee? Antha. Nay, you are myne. Alci. From what foule wombe? Antha. I'le tell thee. Lord Clephis being employ'd on an Ambasage That held him long abroad, what out of Mallice To him, and strong affection to his wife, I did preuaile so much with Bribes and Prayers, I lay with her, and gott thee. All things were Carried so closely that 'twas neuer knowne; And my wife too miscarried at that tyme, And died in Child-bed; so I bred thee vp, As my Legitimate son, and Clephis had Selina afterwards by the same woman. So you are Brother and sister. This was it Made mee so oppositt against your meetings. Wo'd I ha' bene so cruell elce? Alci. My sister! Antha. Both by one Mother. Alci. Then there is no curse Could ha' bene greater to mee. O you haue Nourisht a Serpent, and haue putt into it Besids its owne, a poison that will breake it. Why, what wild beast am I? My Sister—Is there A punishment more greiuous? Co'd dull Nature, Wittie in Villanie, inuent a worse? It is like lead dropping into my Marrow, Which neuer can be quencht, although the Venombe Conuerts my Blood to water. Antha. [aside.] Now it works. Alci. Oh whether shall I turne mee? You haue blasted The Spring of all my life, dig'd vp the Roote Of my ripe Hopes, and left mee open to The wonder of the World. Antha. Vex not your selfe All this shall be kept secret; you had neuer Knowne it, but that 'twas to preserue yee. Alci. Yes, You are too subtile i' your Plagues! What torment Haue you prepar'd besides? Haue I a Birth? Or whose shall I bee next? For you haue Power To make mee any thing: can you perswade mee That there is Remedie for the sad troubles Of my greiu'd hart? Giue mee a balme for that. Antha. I can, if thou wilt heare mee. Cast thy thoughts Vpon some other Woman, and thou shalt Haue all the Happines that thou can'st wish for. I loue thee, Alcidonus, dearely too. Alci. Then, show it; kill mee; 'twilbe no great Crime To take away what you did giue, against The Rules of Justice too; you cannot With all your loue make mee more Happie, for I now am weary of my selfe; pray, kill mee. I am already wounded; you haue shott That into mee, will make mee languish euer; 'Tis Charitie to rid mee of my Paine. Antha. Come, y'are to blame; recall your selfe. I tender Too much your safetie, and your green-sick humor Cannot conceiue it: diseas'd Bodies couett What is most Noctious to 'em: So is your Mind Asleepe on lazy thoughts next dore to Lust. Alci. The effects of that curs'd Fate by which I am yours. Wo'd I might sleepe for euer, that the Night Of all my Cares might neuer find a day; Or that my greifs, too many, and too waighty, Wo'd lag my heauy Soule vnto its Rest. Antha. I am asham'd to see yee. Alci. So am I Asham'd to looke vpon my selfe. Antha. Farewell! Consider what I haue said, and bee aduis'd. Exit. Alci. Ther's no Aduice can serue; my ignorance Hath trod the paths of wickednes, and my Blood Burnes with black Incest. O how harsh this newes Wilbe to my Selina? 'Tis too true! No Deuill could inuent so much ill, if it be not It is impossible to find it out Though by the Light of Shame. No, Alcidonus, Thy ioyes are buried now, and thou canst haue No rest at all but in a quiet graue! Exit.</field>

'Tis our best Refuge. There wee may find ease To all our toyles, and vnder the soft wing Of Blessed Peace, meet an Eternall rest. Seli. Is there such Hapines? Alci. In those blest shades Where Pure loue makes abode, the rauisht Soule Hath a Delight aboue the reatch of Sence And on those pleasant Bancks wee may renewe Our loues, an vnknowne way; the name of Brother Shalbe no opposition to those ioyes; But in a ioynt Contexture wee will moue, Farr from the Rules of flesh; no whisperings Shall call our Meetings Incest, nor no shame Shadowe the Essence of our Loues Seli.

To loue was Naturall. Seli. Like Brother and Sister. Alci. Should wee stint our selues, And call just Heauen to account for our Creation, When all the faculties of Reason, yeilded A freedome to vs?

What dost thou meane then? Andru. I must kill thee, King. King. Thou darst not, Slaue. Andru. I durst not, wert thou Noble. But since you haue left that, I haue left of My Loyalty. Prepare thy selfe to dye. King. How haue I iniur'd thee? Andru. Thy lust hath don't; Thou hast abus'd my Child, my onely daughter, Rob'd her of her deare honor, and thy Blood Must hide the Coulor of our shame. King. Out, Peasant. Wilt thou murder mee for that? Andru. For that: Is't not enough? Am I lesse sencible Of Iniury by beeing Poore? 'Tis meanes And Power that do's reuenge, not honor onely; Shee liues in Cottages aswell as Courts, And wants but onely way t'effect her Wishes; Which I haue found. Therfore as swift as thought, Call thy lou'd Sinns to account. King. Thou darst not touch A haire of Myne; were euery drop of Blood, In thy rude veines, suckt from the Breasts of Queenes: A poore base Mercinary Swisser— Andru. Yes! The Court foole, Sir, to stretch your lungs. 'Tis now The readiest way to thriue, therfore in fashion. Yett I was honest while you had your Vertue; 'Tis you haue alter'd mee: when Kings do leaue Their Goodnes, they make euery Slaue their Master. King. I haue offended Heauen. Andru. Are you prepar'd? Knocking within. Ariol. [within.] Breake downe the dores. Andru. I must dispatch! Enter ARIOLDVS with a Gard. Ariol. Lay hold Vpon that Traitor. How d'yee, Royall Sir? My life and all my ioyes depend vpon Your Preseruation. Presents him a sword. King. Thou hast cause, Arioldus, To bee more Cruell to mee. Ariol. I haue checkt My former Rages, and will neuer rise Till I haue gott your Pardon for 'em. King. Take mee Into thy Bosome. (Enter Princesse Panopia.) Sister, thanke this man Thy Brother liues. Pano. Wo'd I could thanke him too For sauing mee; but I am lost, quite lost, Ne're to be found agen within the Limitts Of Modestie. You Koope mee vp with Promises, And flatter mee with Hopes, which makes my Passions More violent. They must, and shall breake out. King. Fie, fie, Panopia. Pano. I will haue this man, Loue him, enioy him: I am almost mad for him. This dainty man: wo'd I co'd Rauish him. The Currant of my blood holds the same force That yours did. I'me your sister, and as vitious. King. Haue you no shame? Pano. You see myne, but your owne's Incensible; either now make mee happie, Or to all commers I will Prostitute This vigorous Body, till diseasses brands Her Lust vpon my face. (Aside.) Forgiue mee, Modestie! King. Oh my best freind! My Sister rages for thee, Pittie her youth. Be more reseru'd, Panopia, Thou shalt preuaile—Arioldus— Pano. [sings.] Hee's a Cabinett of treasure The very Soule and life of Pleasure, Spirit and Genius of the Age, Natures primest Equipage: All that's good and Louely, wee Find in him: And this is hee. King. Can you heare this, Arioldus, and not melt? Remember her Birth—Deare sister, be more temperate. [To Ariol.] I'le giue thee half my Kingdome with her. Ariol. 'Tis not The worlds vast Body, were it all one Diamond, Can buy mee to her, could you giue it mee, And power to sett it in some Sphere, to make Perpetuall day, and ease the aged Moone; Or could you place mee in some glory by 'em, To out shine both: I'de rather bee a Chaos Then breake the vowes I make. King. What vowes? Ariol. I haue sworne To looke no more on woman with affection. Till poore abus'd Eurinia find a Peace To her perplexed Hart. King. What peace d'yee looke for? Make her Conditions. Ariol. Till her ruin'd honor Bee builded vp agen. King. You mistake the Ground, Honor, where is't? Ariol. In her. (Enter Eurinia.) See, where shee comes Loaden with all her Sorrowes. [To Euri.] Thou faire Harbor Of a More glorious Soule, I vow againe heere; No Power, no Torment shall inforce my loue To woman, more then 'tis, vntill that hand That hurt thee, heale thee. King. How, Arioldus, will you Force mee to this? Ariol. I will not vrge you, Sir; Giue mee but that same liberty with your sister. Pano. I must not be delayed. King. [to Pano.] Peace, Impudence. [To Ariol.] This is a rude Condition, Arioldus. Ariol. I tye yee, Sir, to Nothing; giue mee freedome To make my owne Ellection of my wife. But this I'le tell yee, Princes may do wronge But are not free from danger; ther is one Attempted an Assassinate vpon you, And shall haue Condigne Punishment; but think you There are not more a' the same tribe? The Greatest Liue but in feare when they offend: beleeue it, Sir, I will bring you peace within. King. A goodly Marriage! A thing of no birth, Quallity, nor fortune, A Mountaine Swissers Daughter! Andru. Shee is not. Hee discouers. King. Aribert! Andru. Hopeles of Pardon I present my selfe Vnto your Mercy; y'haue vndone the daughter Now take the fathers life. King. Is this Eugenia? Andru. It is the poore Eugenia. King. My first Loue. Where were my sences that I knew thee not? Ariol. And to take of the blemish from Lord Aribert, We're all as guilty as hee. King. How? Ariol. Not to hurt you. Your Sister's in the Plott. [Kneeling.] We all beg Pardon. King. You haue it; rise! And pray, vnfold this Ridle. Ariol. The Loue betwixt your Sister and mee being firme, And a iust temper hauing brought our Reason To a more due Consideration; Weighing your Noblenes; that heat of youth More then a settled mischeife had giuen fire To this erruption; wee deuis'd this Plott To make all whole agen. That Aribert By his attempt vpon you should demonstrate How dangerously open great men lye Vnto Reuenge, that haue done Iniurie. The Vertuous Princesse vrg'd by my perswasion (Though much against her Mind) was to persue mee With strong affection. Pano. My part was the hardest. Ariol. And I to hold of till this iniur'd Lady Should be restor'd agen, which wee conceiu'd Wo'd bee, when you did know it was Eugenia. King. Why did you vse such Circumstance to that Which I desir'd aboue my Life? Eugenia! I haue my Wish. Euri. I am your humble Vassaile. King. Thou hast bene cruell to mee long, Eugenia. Euri. I doe confesse it, Sir, I lou'd Arioldus Aboue all title; 'twas my stubborne fate then, But Heauen will haue it otherwise. King. I am Aforehand with him now indeed. And Aribert, Thy Banishment proceeded from thy daughters harshnes; But wee are all pleas'd now, M'thinks I am lighter; Ther was a heauynes vpon my Breast Which I haue shakt of; when the Newes was brought mee Of Alcidonus and Selinas deathes, Me thought all round about mee threatned nothing But blood and Horror. (A great shout within.) How now, what's the matter? [Enter] ASPRANDVS. Aspra. This ioy is for the abused Louers, Sir; They liue agen. King. By what strange Accident? [Enter] CLEPHIS, ALCIDONVS, SELINA, ISEAS. Clep. That story shalbe myne, great Prince. Y'aue heard. Antharis cruelty to 'em. King. Yes, with wonder. Clep. I euer feared his harshnes wo'd prouoke 'em Vnto some desperate Course; which made mee watch With the more vigillent Eye vpon their actions, So that by spies I did not onely find The intent, but way how to preuent the poison; Making it onely a sleeping Potion, which Hath wrought all his effects. And heere they stand As new borne Soules. King. A better fortune follow 'em. Ariol. The Joy and Hapines of Loue attend 'em. Pano. You speake my wishes. King. But where is Antharis, The Cruell Father? Clep. Past all cure distracted. King. Lett theise abused Louers then inioy All that hee calls his, but his Misereis; And Clephis, wee haue Stories too, for which This day shalbe to all Posterity A day of Joy. Now I looke bright agen, And all the Clouds that hung about my hart Are by theise beames dispeirst; there is no sence Distracts more then a Troubled Conscience. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGVE Although the Earth be fixt, those things that bee In it are subiect to vncertainetie. The same Soile brings forth ill, and well, procur'd With the same cost, with the same paines manur'd. And though Times course be Constant, he hath had His intermissions too of Good and Bad. Ther's nothing firme; Man, the Worlds spirit, is In this vast Body full of Contraries.
