      <field name="fulltext">To my VVorthy and much Respected Friend, Mr. Thomas Hammon, of Grayes Inne Esquire. Sir, If the noble Scholler Nichod. Friseelimus, thought that his labour in Transferring six of Aristophanes his Comedies, out of the Originall Greeke into the Roman tongue, was worthy to be dedicated to six seueral, the most eminent Princes of his time, for Learning and Iudgement: Thinke it then no disparagment to you, to vndertake as well the Patronage, perusall of this Poem: Which as it exceedes the strict limits of the ancient Comedy (then in vse) informe, so it transcends them many degrees; both in the fulnesse of the Sceane, and grauity of the Subject. The History whereon it is grounded, hauing beene the selected Argument of many exquisite Poets: For what the Pen of note, in one page or other hath not remembered Troy, and bewayl'd the sacke, and subuersion of so illustrious a Citty: Which, although it were scituate in Asia, yet out of her ashes hath risen, two of the rarest Phœnixes in Europe, namely London and Rome. Sir my acquaintance with your worth, and knowledge of your iudgement, were the chiefe motiues, inducing me to select you before many others: accept it, I intreate you, as fauourably as hee exposeth it willingly, who as he hath antecedently long, so futurely euer, Shall remayne yours: Thomas Heywood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Reader. Courteous Reader: The Gold, Siluer, and Brasse Ages hauing beene many yeares since in the Presse, continuing the History from Iupiters Birth (the sonne of Saturne) to the Death of Hercules. This Iron Age (neuer till now Published,) beginneth where the other left, holding on, a plaine and direct course, from the second Rape of Hellen: (For she was in her minority rauished by Theseus the Friend of Hercules) not onely to the vtter ruine, and deuastation of Troy; but it, with the second Part, stretcheth to the Deathes of Hellen, and all those Kings of Greece, who were the vndertakers of that Ten yeares Bloody and fatall Seige. I presume the reading there of shall not proue distastfull vnto any: First inregard of the Antiquity and Noblenesse of the History: Next because it includeth the most things of especiall remarke, which haue beene ingeniously Commented, and labouriously Recorded, by the Muses Darlings, the Poets: And Times learned Remembrancers; the Histriographers. Lastly, I desire thee to take notice, that these were the Playes often (and not with the least applause,) Publickely Acted by two Companies, vppon one Stage at once, and haue at sundry times thronged three seuerall Theaters, with numerous and mighty Auditories, if the grace they had then in the Actings, take not away the expected luster, hoped for in the Reading, I shall then bold thee well pleased, and therein, my selfe fully satisfied; Euer remaining thine as studious. Prodesse vt Delectare: Thomas Heywood.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus Scœna prima. Enter King Priamus, Queene Hecuba, Hector, Troilus, Æneas, Deiphobus, &amp;c. Priamus. Princes and Sonnes of Priam, to this end Wee cal'd you to this solemne Parleance. There's a deuining spirit prompts mee still. That if we new begin Hostility, The Grecians may be forc't to make repayre Of our twice ruin'd walls, and of the rape Done to our sister faire Hesione. Æneas. I am my princely Soueraigne of your minde, And can by grounded arguments approoue Your power and potency: what they twice demolish't, Is now with strength and beauty rear'd againe. Your Kingdome growne more populous and rich, The youth of Troy irregular and vntam'd, Couetous of warre and martiall exercise. From you and siluer tressed Hecuba Fifty faire sonnes are lineally deriu'd, All Asiaes Kings are in your loue and league, Their royalties as of your Empire held. Hector and Hectors brothers are of power To fetch your sister from the heart of Greece, Where she remaines imbrac't by Telamon. Pria. Æneas, your aduise assents with vs. How stand our sonnes vnto these wars inclin'd? Hect. In mine opinion we haue no iust cause To rayse new tumults, that may liue in peace: Warre is a fury quickly coniured vp, But not so soone appeased. Par. What iuster cause When the whole world takes note to our disgrace, Of this our Troy, twice rac't by Hercules. Troy. And faire Hesione rapt hence to Greece, Where she still liues coopt vp in Salamine. Hect. Troy, was twice rac't, and Troy deseru'd that wracke, The valiant (halfe Diuine bred) Hercules, Redeem'd this Towne from blacke mortality, And my bright Aunt from death, when he surcharg'd The virgin fedde, Sea-monster with his club. For my owne Grand-sire great Laomedon, Denied the Heroe, both the meede propos'd, And most (ingratefull) shut him from the Gates: Troy therefore drew iust ruine on itselfe: Tis true, our Aunt was borne away to Greece, Who with more iustice might transport her hence, Then he whose prise she was? bold Telamon For ventring first vpon the wals of Troy, Alcides gaue her to the Salmine Duke. Detayning her? whom keepes he but his owne? Were she my prisoner I should do the like. By Ioue she's worth the keeping. Par. Then of force, Shee must be worth the fetching. Hect. Fetch her that list: my reuerent King and father, If you pursue this expedition, By the vntaunted honor of these armes That liue imblazon'd on my burnish't shield, It is without good cause, and I deuine Of all your flourishing liue, by which the Gods haue rectified your fame aboue all Kings, Not one shal liue to meate your Sepulchre, Or trace your funerall Heralds to the Tombes Of your great Aucestours: oh for your honour Take not vp vniust Armes. Æne. Prince Hectors words Will draw on him the imputation Of feare and cowardesie. Troi. Fie brother Hector, If our Aunts rape, and Troyes destruction Bee not reueng'd, their seuerall blemishes The aged hand of Time can neuer wipe From our succession. 'Twill be registred That all King Priams sonnes saue one were willing And forward to reuenge them on the Greekes, Onely that Hector durst not. Hect. Ha, durst not didst thou say? effeminate boy, Go get you to your Sheepe-hooke and your Scrip, Thou look'st not like a Souldier, there's no fire Within thine eyes, nor quills vpon thy chinne, Tell me I dare not? go, rise, get you gone: Th'art fitter for young Cenons company Then for a bench of souldiers: here comes one, Antenor is returned. Enter Antenor. Pri. Welcome Antenor, what's the newes from Greece? Ante. Newes of dishonour to the name of Priam, Your Hignesse Sister faire Hesiones Esteem'd there as a strumpet, and no Queene; (After complaint) when I propos'd your Maiesty would fetch her thence perforce, had you but seene With what disdainefull pride, and bitter taunts They tost my threats: 'twould haue inflam'd your spleene With more then common rage, neuer was Princesse So basely vs'd: neuer Embassadour With such dishonour sent from Princes Court, As was then from that of Telamons, Of Agamemnons and the Spartan Kings. Priam. I shall not dye in peace, if these disgraces Liue vnreueng'd. Hect. By Ioue wee'le fetch her thence, Or make all populous Greece a Wildernesse, Paris a hand, wee are friends, now Greece shall finde And thou shalt know what mighty Hector dares. When all th'vnited Kings in Armes shall rue This base dishonour done to Priams blood. Par. Heare Gracious sir, my dreame in Ida Mount, Beneath the shadow of a Cedar sleeping. Celestiall Iuno, Venus, and the Goddesse Borne from the braine of mighty Iupiter. These three present me with a golden Ball, On which was writ, Detur pulcherrimæ, Giue't to the fairest: Iuno proffers wealth, Scepters and Crownes: saith, she will make me rich. Next steps forth Pallas with a golden Booke, Saith, reach it me, I'le teach the Litterature, Knowledge and Arts, make thee of all most wise. Next smiling Venus came, with such a looke Able to raiush mankinde: thus bespake mee, Make that Ball mine? the fairest Queene that breathes, I'le in requitall, cast into thine armes. How can I stand against her golden smiles, When beautie promist beauty? shee preuayl'd: To her I gaue the prise, with which shee mounted Like to a Starre from earth shott vp to Heauen. Now if in Greece (as some report) be Ladies Peerelesse for beauty, wherefore might not Paris By Venus ayde sayle hence to Grecia, And quit the rape of faire Hesione, By stealing thence the Queene most beautifull, That feedes vpon the honey of that ayre? Pri. That amorous Goddesse borne vpon the waues Assist thee in thy voyage, we will rigge A royall fleete to waft thee into Greece. Æneas with our sonne Deiphobus, And other Lords shall beare thee company. What thinke our sonnes Hector and Troylus Of Paris expedition? Hect. As an attempt the Heauens haue cause to prosper. Go brother Paris, if thou bring'st a Queene, Hector will be her Champion; then let's see What Greeke dare fetch her hence. Pri. Sraight giue order To haue his Fleet made ready. Enter Cassandra with her haire about her eares. Cassan. Stay Priam, Paris cease, stay Troian Peeres To plot your vniuersall ouerthrow. What hath poore Troy deseru'd, that you should kindle Flames to destroy it? Pa. What intends Cassandra? Cass. To quench bright burning Troy, to secure thee, To saue old Priam and his fifty sonnes. (The royal'st issue, that e're King I enioy'de) To keepe the reuerent haires of Hecuba, From being torne off by her owne sad hands. Pri. Cassandra's madde. Cass. You are mad, all Troy is madde. And railes before it's ruine. Hect. What would my sister? Cass. Stay this bold youth my brother, who by water Would sayle to bring fire which shall burne all Troy. Stay him, oh stay him, ere their golden roofes Melt o're our heads before these glorious Turrets Bee burnt to ashes. Ere cleare Simois streames Runne with bloud royall, and Scamander Plaine, In which Troy stancis bee made a Sepulchre To bury Troy, and Troians. Pri. Away with her, some false deuining spirit Enuying the honour we shall gaine from Greece, Would trouble our designements. Hect. Royall sir, Cassandra is a Vestall Prophetesse, And consecrate to Pallas; oft inspir'd, Then lend her gracious audience. Troil. So let our Aunt Bee still a slaue in Greece, and wee your sonnes Bee held as cowards. Æne. Let Antenors wrongs Bee basely swallowed, and the name of Troy Be held a word of scorne. Cass. Then let Troy burne, Let the Greekes clap their hands, and warme themselues At this bright Bone-fire: dream'd not Hecuba The night before this fatall Youth was borne, That shee brought forth a fire-brand? Hecu. 'Tis most true. Cass. And when King Priam to the Preist reueal'd This ominous dreame, hee with the Gods consulted, And from the Oracle did this returne, That the Childe borne should stately Islion burne. Par. And well the Prophet guest, for my desire To visit Greece, burnes with a quenchlesse fire: Nor from this flaming brand shall I be free, Till I haue left rich Troy, and Sparta see. Cass. Yet Hecuba, ere thou thy Priam loose, And Priam ere thou loose thy Hecuba, Pri. Away with her. Cass. Why speakes not in this case Andromache? Thou shalt loose a Hector, who's yet thine. Why good Æneas dost thou speech forbeare? Thou hop'st in time another Troy to reare, When this is sackt, and therefore thou standst mute, All strooke with silence; none assist my suite. Pri. Force her away and lay her fast in hold. Cass. Then Troy, no Troy, but ashes; and a place Where once a Citty stood: poore Priam, thou That shalt leaue fatherlesse fifty faire sonnes, And this thy fruitfull Queene, a desolate widdow, And Ilium now no Pallace for a King, But a confused heape of twice burnt bricke. They that thy beauty wondred, shall admire To see thy Towers defac'd with Greekish fire. Exit. Pri. Thou art no Sibill, but from fury speak'st, Not inspiration we reguard thee not. Come valiant sonnes, wee'le first prepare our ships, And with a royall Fleete well rigg'd to sea Seeke iust reuenge for faire Hestone. Exeunt omnes, manet Paris, to him Oenon who in his goign out plucks her backe. Oen. Know you not mee? Par. Who art thou? Oen. View mee well. And what I am, my lookes and teares will teach thee. Par. Oenon? what brought thee hither? Oen. To see Ida bare Of her tall Cedars, to see shipwrights square The trunks of new feld Pines: Asking the cause, So many Hatchets, Hammers, Plowes and Sawes Were thither brought: They gan mee thus to greete, With these tall Cedars we must build a fleete For Paris; who in that must sayle to Greece, To fetch a new wife thence. Par. And my faire Oenon, Know that they told truth, for 'tis decreed Euen by the Gods behest, that I should speed Vpon this new aduenture: The Gods all, That made mee iudge to giue the golden Ball. Harke, harke, the Saylers cry aboard, aboard; The Winde blowes faire, fare-well. Oenon. Heare me one word. By our first loue, by all our amorous kisses, Courtings, imbraces, and ten thousand blesses I coniure thee, that thou in Troy may'st stay. Par. They cry aboard, and Paris must away. Oen. What need'st thou plowe the seas to seeke a wife, Hauing one here, to hazard thy sweete life, Seeking a Strumpet through warres fierce alarmes, And haue so kind a wife lodg'd in thine armes. Par. Sweete Oenon, stay me not, vnclaspe thine hold. Oen. Not for Troyes crowne or all the Sun-gods Gold. Canst thou? oh canst thou thy sweete life indanger, And leaue thine owne wife to seeke out a stranger? Pa. I can, farewell. Oen. Oh yet a little stay. Pa. Let go thine hold, or I shall force my way. Oen. Oh do but looke on me, yet once againe. Though now a Prince, thou wast an humble swaine, And then I was thine Oenon. (Oh sad fate) I craue thy loue, I couet not thy state; Still I am Oenon: still thou Paris art The selfe-same man, but not the selfe-same heart: Par. Vatie, or I shall breake thy charming band, Neptune assist my course: thou Ioue my hand. Exit. Oen. Most cruell, most vnkind, hadst thou thus said The night before thou hadst my Maiden-head, I had beene free to chuse, and thou to wiue; Not widdowed now, my husband still aliue. Enter King Menelaus, King Diomed, Thersites, a Lord Embassadour with Attendants. Mene. King Diomed. Sparta is proud to see you, Your comming at this time's more seasonable, In that wee haue imployment for your wisedome And royall valour. Diom. The Chritian Scepter now in contrauersie (As this Embassadour hath late inform'd) Despising that vsurping hand, which long Hath against Law and Iustice swayd and borne it, Offers it selfe to your protection. Is it not so my Lord? Embassa. You truely vnderstand our Embasie. Ther. Menelaus! Mene. What saith Thersites? Ther. That Heauen hath many Starres in't, but no eyes, And cannot see desert. The Goddesse Fortune Is head-winkt, why else should she proffer thee Another Crowne that hath one: (Grand Sir Ioue) What a huge heape of businesse shalt thou haue, Hauing another Kingdome? being in Creete, Sparta will go to wracke, being in Sparta, Creete will to ruine: To haue more then these Such a bright Lasse as Hellen: Hellen? oh! 'Must haue an eye to her too, fie, fie, fie, Poore man how thou'lt bee pufl'd! Mene. Why thinkes Thersites my bright Hellens beauty Is not with her faire vertues equaliz'd? Ther. Yes, I thinke so, and Hellen is an asse, But thou beleeu'st so too. Diom. Thersites is a rayler. Ther. No, I disclaim't, I am a Counsellor I haue knowne a fellow matcht to a faire wife, That hath had ne're a Kingdome: thou hast two To looke to, (searce a house) thou many Pallaces, Hee scarce a Page, and thou a thousand seruants: Yet hee hauing no more, yet had too much To looke to one faire wife. Diom. Were not the King Well grounded in the vertues of his Queene, Thy words Thersites might set odds betwixt them. Mene. My Hellen? therein am I happiest. Know Diomed, her beauty I preferre Before the Crownes of Sparta, and of Creete. Musicke within. Musicke! I know my Lady then is comming, To giue kind welcome to King Diomed, Strowe in her way sweete powders, burne Perfume, And where my Hellen treads no feete presume. Ther. 'Twere better strowe horne-shauings. Enter Hellen with waiting Gentlewomen and Seruants. Hel. 'Tis told vs this Embassadour doth stay To take my husband, my deare Lord away. Men. True Hellen, 'tis a Kingdome calls me hence. Hel. A Kingdome! hath your Hellen such small grace, That you preferre a Kingdome 'fore her face? You value me too cheape, and doe not know The worth and value of the face you owe. Ther. I had rather haue a good Calues face. Hess. Theseus, that in my non-age did assaile mee, And being too young for pastime, thence did haile me: Hee, to haue had the least part of your blisse Oft proffered mee a Kingdome for a kisse. You surfeit in your pleasures, swimme in sport, But sir, from henceforth I shall keepe you short. Dio. Faire Queene, 'tis honour calls him hence away. Hel. What's that to Hellen, if shee'le haue him stay? Say I should weepe at parting, (which I feare) Some for ten Kingdomes would not haue a teare Fall from his Hellens eye, but hee's vnkind, And cares not though I weepe my bright eyes blind. Enter a Spartan Lord. Sp. L. Great King, we haue discouer'd from the shoare A gallant Fleete of ships, that with full sayle Make towards the Port. Mene. What number? Sp. L. Some two and twenty Sayle. Men. Discouer them more amply, and make good the Hauen against them, till we know th'intent of their arriue. Sp. L. My Royall Lord I shall. Men. Embassadour this busines once blowne o're, You shall receiue your answer instantly. Hel. You shall not goe and leaue your Hellen here, Can I a Kingdome gouerne in your absence, And guide so rude a people as yours is? How shall I doe my Lord, when you are gone, So many bleake cold nights to lye alone? Y'haue vs'd mee so to fellowship in bed, That should I leaue it, I should soone be dead: Troth I shall neuer indure it. Men. My sweete Hellen, Was neuer King blest with so chaste a wife. Enter the Spartan Lord. Men. The newes? whence is their Fleete? Sp. L. From Troy. Men. The Generall? Sp. L. Priams sonne. Men. Their expedition? Sp. L. To seeke aduentures and strange Lands abroad, And though now weather-beat, yet brauer men, More rich in Iewells, costlier araide, Or better featur'd ne're eye beheld, Especially the Prince their Generall, Paris of Troy one of King Priams sonnes. Hel. Brauer then these our Lacedemons are? Sp. L. Madam, by much. Hel. How is the Prince of Troy To Menelaus mighty Spartans King? Sp. L. Prince Menelaus is my Soueraigne Madam, But might I freely speake without offence, (Excepting Menelaus) neuer breath'd A brauer Gallant then the Troian Prince. Men. What Intertainment shall wee giue these strangers? Hel. What? but the choyce that Lacedemon yeelds, If they come braue, our brauery let vs show, That what our Sparta yeelds, their Troy may know: Let them not say they found vs poore and bare. Or that our Grecian Ladies are lesse faire Then theirs: giue them occasion to relate At their returne, how wee exceede their state. Mene. Hellen hath well aduis'd, and for the best Her counsell with our honour doth agree, All Spartaes pompe is for the Troians free. Hell. Oh had I known their Landing one day sooner, That Hellen might haue trim'd vp her attire Against this meeting, then my radiant beauty I doubt not, might in Troy be tearm'd as faire, As through all Greece I am reputed rare. A flourish. Enter Paris, Æneas, Deiphobus, Antenor, Menelaus and Diomed embrace Paris and the rest: Paris turnes from them and kisseth Hellen, all way shee with her hand puts him backe. Hell. 'Tis not the Spartan fashion thus to greet Vpon the lips, when royall strangers meete. I know not what your Asian Court-ship is. Oh Ioue, how sweetely doth this Troian kisse? Par. Beare with a stranger Lady, though vnknowne; That's practis'd in no fashion saue his owne. Hee that his fault confesseth ne're offends, Nor can hee iniure, that no wrong intends, Hell. To kisse mee! why before so many eyes The King could do no more: would fortune bring This stranger there where I haue met the King, Mene. Patience, sweet Hellen, Troians welcome all, You shall receiue the princeliest entertaine Sparta can yeeld you, but some late affaires About the Cretan scepter calls vs hence, That businesse once determin'd wee are yours, In the meane time faire Hellen bee't your charge To make their welcome in my absence large. They all goe off with a flourish, onely Paris and Hellen keepe the Stage. Par. Oh Ioue my dreame! sweete Venus ayde my prayer, And keepe thy word: behold a face more faire Then thou thy selfe canst shewe, this is the same Thou promist me in Ida, this I claime. Giue me this face faire Uenus, and that's all I'le aske in guerdon of the golden Ball. Hel. Of what rare mettall is this Troian made? That one poore kisse hath power so to perswade, Here at my lips the sweetnesse did beginne, And since hath past through all my powers within: Oh kisse mee if thou lou'st me once againe, I feele the first kisse thrill through euery veine. Par. Queene I must speake with you, Hell. Must? Par. Hellen, I, I haue but two wayes to take, to speake, or dye: Grant my tongue pardon then, or turne your head And say you will not, and so strike me dead. Hel. Liue and say on, but if your words offend, If my tongue can destroy, you're neare your end. Par. Oh Ioue, that I had now an Angels voyce As you an Angels shape haue, that my words Might sound as spheare-like musicke in your eare. That Ioue himselfe whom I must call to witnesse, Would now stand forth in person to approoue What I now speake, Hellen, Hellen I loue. Chide mee, I care not; tell, your husband, doe, Fearelesse of death, behold, I boldly woe, For let mee liue, bright Hellen to inioy, Or let mee neuer backe resayle to Troy: For you I came, your fame hath hither driuen mee, Whom golden Venus hath by promise giuen mee. I lou'd you ere I saw you by your fame, Report of your rare beauty to Troy came. But more then bruite can tell, or fame emblazon Are these diuine perfections that I gaze on. Hel. Insolent stranger, is my Name so light Abroad in Troy, that thou at the first sight Shouldst hope to strumpet vs? thinks Priams sonne, The Spartan Queene can be so easily wonne? Because once Theseus rauisht vs from hence, And did to vs a kind of violence: Followes it therefore wee are of such price, That stolne hence once, we should be rauish't twice? Par. That Theseus stole you hence (by Heauen) I praise him, And for that act I to the skies will raise him. That hee return'd you backe by Ioue I wonder, Had I beene Theseus, hee that should asunder Haue parted vs, and snatcht you from my bed: First from my should shoulders haue tane this head. Oh that you were the prize of some great strife, And hee that winnes might claime you as his wife, Your selfe should finde, and all the world should see Hellen, a prise alone ordain'd for mee. Hel. I am not angry; who can angry be With him that loues her? they that Paris see, And heares the wonders and rare deedes you boast, And warlike spoyles in which you glory most: By which you haue attaind 'mongst souldiers grace, None can beleeue you that beholds your face. They that this louely Troian see, will say; Hee was not made for warre, but amorous play. Pa. Loue amorous Paris then. Hel. My fame to endanger? Par. I can be secret Lady. Hel. And a stranger? Say I should grant thee loue, as thou shouldst clime My long wisht bed; if at th'appointed time The Winde should alter, and blow faire for Troy, Thou must breake off in midd'st of all thy Ioy. Par. Not for great Spartaes Crowne, or Asiaes Treasure, (That exceedes Spartaes) would I loose such pleasure. Hel. would it were come to that. Par. Your Husband Menelaus hither bring, Compare our shapes, our youth and euery thing, I make you Iudgesse, wrong me if you can: You needes must say I am the properer man. Hel. I must confesse that too. Par. Then loue mee Lady. Hel. Had you then sett sayle, When my virginity, and bed to enioy A thousand gallant princely Suiters came? Had I beheld thee first, I here proclaime, Your feature should haue borne mee from the rest. You come too late, and couet goods possest. Par. I came from Hellen, Hellens loue I craue, Hellen I loue, and Hellen I must haue: Or in this Prouince where I vent my mones, I'le begge a Tombe for my exiled bones. A flourish. Enter. Menelaus, Diomed, Thersites with Spartan Lords: Æneas, Deiphobus, Antenor, &amp;c. A banquet is brought in. Men. Now Prince of Troy, our businesse being o're This day in Lacedemon, you shall feast Paris, wee are proud of such a Princely guest. Ther. Thus euery man is borne to his owne Fate. Now it raines Hornes, let each man shield his Pate. Hel. This royalty extended to the welcome Of Priams sonne, is more then Asiaes King Would yeeld vnto the greatest Prince of Greece. What is this Paris whom you honour so? Men. Why askes my Queene? Hel. May not this proud, this beauty vanting Troian, In a smooth browe hide blacke and rugged Treason? Men. Hee such an one? rather a giddy braine, A formall traueller. King Diomed Your censure of this Troian? Diom. A Capring, Carpet Knight, a Cushion Lord, One that hath stald his Courtly trickes at home, And now got leaue to publish them abroad Hee's a meere toy. Men. Thersites your opinion. Men. Did'st euer see wisdome thus attir'd? Ther. I haue knowne villany hath lookt as smooth As yon briske fellow. Mene. I am a foole then say. Ther. And so thou art, To hugge the Serpent fraud so neere your heart. Men. Shallow Thersites, my faire Prince of Troy Welcome, come sit betwixt my Queene and mee. Ther. Hee'le one day stand betwixt thy Queene and thee. I haue obseru'd, 'tis still the Cuckolds fate To hugge that knaue who helps to horne his pate. Men. Fill me a standing Bowle of Greekish wine: Prince Paris, to your Royall Fathers health. Par. Thankes Menelaus. Here King Diomed. Dio. To you Æneas. Æne. Thersites, 'tmust go round. Ther. Not I, full bowles make empty braines, not I. Mene. Hellen, the more to dignifie his welcome Beginne a health to aged Hecuba. Ther. Men may be drunke, but hee's a drunken foole That brings his wife vp in the Drinking-schoole: Hel. Prince Paris, to the reuerent Hecuba. Par. Will the Spartan King vouchafe the pledge of Priams Queene? Men. Prince Diomed, and so to you Thersites, This health must needes passe round. Ther. 'Twill make you all turne round before you part. Diom. To you Thersites. Ther. Tis better liue in fire, then dye in wine: That burnes out earth, this drownes a thing diuine. I'le scald my soule no more, Hel. You looke not well Prince Paris, on my life His Colour comes and goes, are you not sicke? Ther. sicke! and so many healths, how can that bee? Par. Peace Cinicke, barke not dogge: King, by your leaue I'le haue one health to beauteous Hellena. Men. It shall be pledg'd Prince Paris. Ther. Drinke till you all drop downe, but when you fall, Looke that the Queene lie vnder-most of all. Par. I'le haue Thersites pledge this. Ther. I'le be no drunkard, Kings and Queene I'le rise. Par. Drinke this or eate my sword. Ther. Say so, I'le kisse the cup. Hel. You are not well Prince Paris, walke with mee. Par. With you! what you? you are the Queene of hearts. Hel. This Chayre serue for your bed, lye downe and sleepe. Par. Thankes Queene: to all good night. Hee sleepes. Men. How now Thersites? this your politition? A shallow weake braine Courtier Dio. Alas poore puny Prince, in troth Thersites You were deceiu'd in him. Ther. I knewe hee was either a politician or a drunkard, your younger Brothers for the most part are so. Men. Well my faire Queene, whil'st wee prepare for Creete, Feast you the Prince: though his behauiour's rude, Let vs be royall, bounty of all things Doth best expresse the Maiesty of Kings. Exeunt all, but Paris and Hellen, at which hee starts vp from from his Chaire and takes her by the hand. Par. Are they all gone? then pardon mee sweete Queene, I was not as I seem'd, but I am now What once I vow'd, a Prince captiu'd to you. Hel. No Paris no, I am the Queene of hearts. Par. And so you are, the Empresse of all hearts: Celestiall Hellen, shall I bee eterniz'd In the fruition of your heauenly loue? Hel. And you deserue it well: O Prince! fie, fie, Dissemble with your friends so cunningly? Par. My loue faire Queene exceedes the loue of friends, And therefore had the royall King your Husband Exprest more loue to mee then euer Monarch Did to a stranger Prince, it could not though Leasen my zeale o you: speake the fayrest Queene That euer spake, this night shall we agree To consecrate to pleasure and delights: Your husband left me charge I should inioy All that the Court can yeeld: if all? then you I would not for the world, but you should doe All that the King your Lord commands you too: Your King and husband, you sinne doubly still VVhen you assent not to obay his will: Speake beauteous Queene. No? then it may be Shee meanes by silence to accord with me: I'le trye that presently, lend me your hand Tis this I want, and by the Kings command You are to let me haue it: more then this, I want your lips to helpe me make a kisse. Kisseth her. Hel. Oh Heauen! Par. Oh loue, a ioy aboue all measure, To touch these lips is more then heauenly pleasure. Hel. Beshrew your amorous rhetorick that did proue My husbands will commanded me to loue, For but for that iniunction, Paris know I would not yeeld such fauours to bestow On any stranger, but since he commands, You may take more then eyther lips or hands. Do I not blush sweete stranger? if I breake The Lawes of modesty, thinke that I speake, But with my husbands tongue, for I say still I would not yeeld, but to obey his will. Par. This night then without all suspition, The rauishing pleasures of your royall bed You may affoord to Paris: bitter Thersites, King Diomed, and your seruants may suppose By my late counterfeite distemperature I ayme at no such happinesse, alas I am a puny Courtier, a weake braine, A braine-sicke young man; but Deuinest Hellen, VVhen we get safe to Troy. Hel. To Troy? Par. Yes Queene, by all the gods it is decreed, That I should beare you thither; Priam knowes it, And therefore purposely did rigge this Fleete, To waft me hether; He and Hecuba, My nine and forty brothers, Princes all Of Ladies and bright Virgins infinite, Will meete vs in the roade of Tenedos; Then be resolu'd for I will cast a plot To beare you safe from hence! Hel. This Troyan Prince Will's more then any Prince of Greece dares pleade, And yet I haue no power to say him nay: VVell Paris I beshrew you with my heart, That euer you came to Sparta (by my ioy Queene Hellen lyes, and longs to be at Troy:) Yet vse me as you please, you know you haue My dearest loue, and therefore cannot craue VVhat Ile deny; but if reproach and shame Pursue vs, on you Paris light the blame: Ile wash my hands of all, nor will I yeeld But by compulsion to your least demaund: Yet if in lieu of my Kings intertaine, You bid me to a feast aboord your ship, And when you haue me there, vnknowne to me Hoyse sayle, weigh Anchor, and beare out to Sea: I cannot helpe it, tis not in my power To let fal sayles, or striue with stretching oares To row me backe againe: this you may do, But sooth friend Paris Ile not yeeld thereto. Par. You shalbe then compell'd, on me let all The danger waiting on this practise fall. Enter a Spartan Lord. Sp. L. Castor and Pollux your two princely brothers Are newly Landed, and to morrow next Purpose for Lacedemon. Hel. On their approach Ile lay my plot to escape away with Paris. I haue it: you sir for some speciall reason There comming keepe conceal'd, but when to morrow You shal perceiue me neere the water port, Euen when thou seest me ready to take Parge. You apprehend me. Sp. L. Gracious Queene I do. Hel. Take that farwel: now my fayre princely guest All that belongs to you's to inuite Queene Hellen Aboord your ship to morrow. Par. Spartaes mirrour, Will you vouchsafe to a poore wandring Prince So much of grace, will your high maiesty Daigne the acceptance of an homely banquet Aboord his weather beaten Barke? Hel. No Friend, The King my husband is from Sparta gone, And I, til his returne, must needes keepe home: Vrge me not I intreate, it is in vaine Get me aboord, Ile nere turne backe againe. Par. Nor shall you Lady, Sparta nor all Greece Shal fetch you thence, but Troy shal stand as high On tearmes with Greece, as Greece hath stood with Troy. Exeunt Enter the Spartan Lord. Spa. L. This is the VVater-port, the Queenes royal guest, hath bound me to attendance, till the Prince and shee bee ready to take VVater: Methinkes in this there should bee some tricke or other, she was once stolne away by Theseus, and this a gallant smooth fac'd Prince. The Kings from home, the Queenes but a VVoman, the Troians ships new trim'd, the wind stands fayre, and the Saylors all ready aboord, sweete meates and wine, good words and opportunity, and indeede not what? If both parties bee pleasde, but pleasde or not, the musicke giues warning, are they not now vpon their entrance. Enter in state Paris, Hellen, Diomed, Thersites, Æneas, Antenor, Deiphebus, &amp;c. with Attendants. Sp. L. Health to your Maiesties, your Princely brothers Castor and Pollux, being within two Leagues Of this great Citty, come to visite you. Hel. My brothers stolne vpon vs vnawares. Let me intreate thee royall Diomed, And you Thersites, do me so much grace, As giue them friendly meeting. Diom. Queene we shall. Exeunt. Hel. Our intertainment shall be giuen aboord, VVhere I presume, they shall be welcome guests To princely Paris. Pa. As to your selfe, faire Queene, Hel. Set forwards then. Pa. We'le hoyse vp sayle, neere to returne againe. Exeunt the Troians with a great shout. Enter Castor, Pollux, Diomed, Thersites. Cast. Our brother Menelaus gone for Creete? Pol. Our loue to see him, makes vs loose much time: Yet all our labour is not vainly spent, Since we shall see our sister. Enter the Spartan Lord in hast. Sp. L. Princes, the Kings betray'd, all Greece dishonoured, the Queene borne hence, the Troians haue weigh'd anchor, and with a prosperous gale they beare from hence: Shouting and hurling vp their caps for ioy, They crye farwel to Greece, amayne for Troy. Ther. Ha, ha, ha. Dio. The Queene borne hence, with that smooth traytor Paris. See princes with what pride they haue aduanc'd The Armes of Troy vpon their wauing pendants. Cast. Rage not, but lets resolue what's to be done. Dio. Let some ride post to Creete for Menelaus. Sp. L. That be my charge. Dio. VVho'le after him to Sea? Pol. That wil my brother Castor and my selfe, And perish there, or bring my sister backe. Dio. Princes be't so, and fairely may you speed: Whilst I to Agamemnon, great Achilles, Vlysses, Nestor, Aiax, Idomean, And all the Kings and Dukes of populous Greece, Relate the wrongs done by this Rauisher. Part, and be expeditious. Exeunt seueral wayes Ther. Ha, ha, ha, I smelt this Sea-rat ere he came a shoare, by this hee's gnawing Menelaus Cheese, and made a huge hole in't a Ship-dyet pleaseth 'boue all his Pallace banquets, much good doo't them: They are at it without grace by this both bare: Cuckold? no subiect with that name bee sorry, Since Soueraignes may be such in all their glory.

The god of Delphos sends you ioyful newes, Troy shal be sackt, and we be Conquerors: Vpon your helmes weare triple spangled plumes: Let all the lowdest instruments of warre, With sterne alarums rowse the monster death, And march we boldly to the wals of Troy, Troy shall be sackt and we be conquerors. Aiax. Thanks for thy newes Achilles, by that honor My father wonne vpon the wals of Troy. My warlike father Aiax Telamon; I would not for the world, Priam should send Incestious Hellen backe on tearmes of peace. May smooth Vlisses and bold Diomed. Whom you haue sent on your late Embassie, Be welcom'd as Antenor was to Greece, Scorn'd and reuil'd, since th'Oracle hath sayd, Troy shal be sackt, and we be Conquerors. Achi. King Agamemnon heere's a Troian priest Was sent by Priam to the Oracle: The reuerent man I welcome, and intreate The General with these Princes, do the like. Agam. Welcome to Agamemnon reuerent Calchas. Men. To Menelaus welcome. Aiax. To Aiax welcome: father canst thou fight As wel as pray, if we should want for men? Cal. By prayers I vse to fight, and by my counsel Giue ayde to Armes. Aiax. Such as are past armes, father Calchas still, Say counsels good, but giue me strength at will, When you with all your Counsel, in the field Meete Hector with his strength, tel me who'le yeeld? Aga, The strong built walls of stately Tenedos We haue leuel'd with the earth. It now remaines We march along vnto the wals of Troy, And thunder vengeance in King Priams cares, Had we once answere of our Embassie. Aiax. I euer held such Embassies as base, The restitution of our rauisht Queene On termes of parley bars our sterne reuenge, And ends our VVar ere fully it beginne. King Agamemnon no, Aiax sayth no, VVhose sword as thirsty as the parched earth, Shal neuer ride in peace vpon his thigh, Whilst in the towne of Troy there breathes a soule That gaue consent vnto the Spartans rape: March, march, and let the thunder of our drummes Strike terrour to the Citty Pergamus. Achil. The sonne of Telamon speakes honourably. Wee haue brought a thousand ships to Tenedos, And euery ship full fraught with men at Armes: And all these armed men with fiery spirits Sworne to reuenge King Menelaus wrongs, And burne skie-kissing Islium to the ground. Therefore strike vp warres Instruments on hye, And march vnto the Towne couragiously. In their march they are met by Vlysses and King Diomed, at which they make a stand. Aga. Princes, what answere touching Hellena? Dio. What answere but dishonourable tearme? Contempt and scorne pearcht on their leaders browes, By Ioue I thought they would haue slaine vs both. If euer Hellen bee redeemd from thence But by the sacke of Troy, say Diomed Is no true souldier. Vlyss. Euen in the King There did appeare such high maiesticke scorne Of threatned ruine, that I thinke himselfe Will put on Armes and meete vs in the field: Wee linger time great Agamemnon, march, That we may buckle with the pride of Troy. Aga. Priam so insolent, his sonnes so braue To intertaine so great Embassadours With such vngentle vsage. Achil. They haue a Knight cal'd Hector, on whose valour They build their proud defiance, if I meete him, Now by the azurd Armes of that bright goddesse From whom I am descended, with my sword I'le loppe that limbe off, and inforce their pride Fall at Achilles feete, Hector and I Must not both shine at once in warres bright Skie. Aiax. When they both meete, the greater dimme the lesse, Great Generall, march, Aiax indures not words So well as blowes, in a field glazd with swords. Enter to them in Armes, Priam, Hector, Troilus, Paris, Æneas, Antenor, Deiphobus, &amp;c. Pri. Calchas a Traitour? Par. And amongst the Greekes? Hect. Base runagate wretch, when we their Tents surprise, As Hector liues the traiterous Prophet dies. Æne. Let not remembrance of so base a wretch Make vs forget our safety, th' Argiue Kings Are landed, and this day rac't Tenedos: And bid vs battaile on Scamander Plaines. Tro. Whom we wil giue a braue and proud affront, Shall we not brother Hector? Hect. Troilus yes, And beate a fire out of their Burgonets Shall like an earthy Commet blaze towards Heauen There grow a fixt starre in the Firmament To emblaze our lasting glory: Harke their Drums, Let our Drummes giue them parleance. A parlie. Both Armies haue an enter-view. Aga. Is there amongst your troopes a fellon Prince Cal'd by the name of Paris? Par. Is there amongst your troopes a Knight so bold Dares meete that Paris single in the field, And call him fellon? Hect. Or insulting Greeke, Is there one Telamon, dares set his foote To Paris (here hee stands) and hand to hand Maintaine the wrongs done to Hesione, As Paris shall the rape of Helena. Aiax. Know here is one cal'd Aiax Telamon, Behold him well, sonne to that Telamon: Thou faine would'st see, and hee dares set his foot To Paris or thy selfe. Hect. Thou durst not. Aiax. Dare not? Hect. Or if thou durst, by this my warlike hand I'le make thine head fall where thy foot should stand: And yet I loue thee cuze, know thou hast parlie'd With Troian Hector. Aiax. Were't thou ten Hectors, yet withall thy might Thou canst not make my head fall to my feete, By Ioue thou canst not cuze. Achil. I much haue heard Of such a Knight cal'd by the name of Hector, If thou bee'st hee whose sword hath conquerd Kingdomes, Pannonia, Illyria, and Samothrace, And to thy fathers Empire added them: Achilles as a friend wils thee to sheath Thy warlike sword, retire from Troyes defence And spare thy precious life, I would not haue A Knight so fam'd meete an vntimely graue. Hect. I meet thee in that honourable loue, And for thine owne sake wish thee safe aboord. For if thou stayest thou sonne of Peleus, I'd haue thee know thy fame is not thine owne, But all ingrost for mee; not all thy guard Of warlike Mirmidons can wall it safe From mighty Hector. Dio. Shame you not great Lords To talke so long ouer your menacing swords? All Greeks. Alarme then for Greece and Helena. All Troians. As much for vs, for Troy and Hecuba. A great alarme and excursions, after which, enter Hector and Paris. Hect. Oh brother Paris, thou hast this day lodg'd Thy loue in Hectors soule, it did me good To see two Greekish Knights fall in their blood Vnder thy manly arme Par. My blowes were touches Vnto these ponderous stroakes great Hector gaue. Oh that this generall quarrell might be ended In equall opposition, you and I Against the two most valiant. Hect. I will try The vertue of a challenge, in the face Of all the Greekes I will oppose my selfe To single combate, hee that takes my gage Shall feele the force of mighty Hectors rage. A turne. Both the Armies make ready to ioyne battaile, but Hector steps betwixt them holding vp his Lance. Hect. Heare mee yon warlike Greekes, you see these fields Are all dyde purple with the reeking gore Of men on both sides slaine, you see my sword Glaz'd in the sanguine moysture of your friends. I call the sonne of Saturne for a witnesse To Hectors words, I haue not met one Grecian Was able to withstand mee, my strong spirit Would faine be equal'd: Is there in your Troupes A Knight, whose brest includes so much of valour To meete with Hector in a single warre? By Ioue I thinke there is not: If there be? To Him I make this proffer; if the gods Shall grant to him the honour of the day, And I be slaine; his bee mine honoured Armes, To hang for an eternall Monument Of his great valour, but my mangled body Send backe to Troy, to a red funerall pile. But if hee fall? the armour which hee weares I'le lodge as Trophies on Apolloes shrine, And yeeld his body to haue funerall rights. And a faire Monument so neere the Sea, That Merchants flying in their sayle-wing'd ships Neere to the shoare in after times may say, There lies the man Hector of Troy did slay, And there's my Gantler to make good my challenge. Men. Will none take vp his gage? shall this proud challenge Bee Intertain'd by none? I know you all Shame to deny, yet feare to vndertake it: The cause is mine, and mine shall be the honour To combat Hector. Aga. Menelaus pawse, Is not Achilles here, sterne Aiax here, And Kingly Diomed? how will they scorne, That stand vpon the honour of their strength, should you preuent them of this glorious combat. Par. By Ioue I thinke they dare as well take vp A poysonous Serpent as great Hectors gage. Aga. Yes Troian, see'st thou not Æacides Dart emmulous lookes on Kingly Diomed, Least hee should stoope to take his Gantlet vp. And see how Diomed eyes warlike Aiax, Aiax, Vlysses: euery one inflam'd To answere Hector. Achil. Is there any here Dares stoope whilst great Achilles is in place? Aiax. I dare. Dio. And so dare I. Achil. You are all too weake To incounter with the mighty Hectors arme, This combat soly doth belong to mee. Aiax. Then wherefore do'st not thou take vp the Gantlet? Achil. To see if thou or any bolder Greeke Dare be so insolent to touch the same, And barre me of the honour of the combat. Aiax. By all the gods I dare. Achil. And all the diuells I'le loppe his hands off that dares touch the gage. Ulyss. Pray leaue this emulous fury: Agamemnon, To end this difference, and prouide a Champion To answere Hectors honourable challenge Of nine the most reputed valiant: Let seuerall Lots be cast into an Helme, Amongst them all one prise, he to whom Fortune Shall giue the honour: let him straight be arm'd To incounter migdty Hector on this plaine. Aga. It shal be so you valiant sonnes of Priam: Conduct your warlike Champion to his Tent, To breath a while, and put his armour on: No sooner shal the prise be drawne by any, And our bold Champion arm'd, but a braue Herald Shall giue you warning by the trumpets sound, Till when we will retire vnto our Tents. As you vnto the Towne. Par. Faint hearted Greekes, Draw lots to answere such a noble challenge, Had great Achilles cast his Gauntlet downe Amongst King Priams sonnes, the weakest of fifty Would in the heate of flames, or mouth of Hel, Answere the challenge of so braue a King. Hect. Greekes to your Tents, to put armour on; Make hast, I long to know my Champion. Exeunt all Flourish. Enter aboue vpon the wals, Priam, Hecuba, Hellena, Polixena, Astianax, Margareton. with attendants. Pri. Here from the wals of Troy, my reuerent Queene, And beautious Hellen, we will stay to see The warlicke combate 'twixt our valiant sonne, And the Greekes champion. Young Astianax, Pray that thy father my haue Victory. Asti. Why should you doubt his fortune? whose strong arme Vnhorst a thousand Knights all in one day; And thinke you any one amongst the Greekes Is able to incounter with his strength? Pri. But howsoever child, vnto the pleasure Of the high gods, we must referre the combate. Enter Paris below. Par. My royall father, Hector in his armes Sends for your blessing, with the Queene my mother, And craues your prayers to the all powerful gods, To grant him victory. Pri. Blest may he be with honor, all my orisons Shall inuocate the gods for his successe. Par. I almost had forgot faire Hellena; Dart me one kisse from these high battlements To cheere him with: thanks queen these lips are charms Which who so fights for, is secure from harmes. Heralds on both sides the two Champions Hector and Aiax appeare betwixt the two Armies. Agam. None presse too neere the Champions. Troi. Heralds on both sides, keep the souldiers back. Hect. Now Greekes let me behold my Champion. Aiax. Tis I, thy cousen Aiax Telamon. Hec. And Cuz, by Ioue thou hast a braue aspect, It cheeres my blood to looke on such a foe: I would there ran none of our Troian blood In all thy veines, or that it were diuided From that which thou receiuest from Telamon: Were I assured our blood possest one side, And that the other; by Olimpicke Ioue, I'd thrill my Iauelin at the Grecian moysture, And spare the Troian blood: Aiax I loue it Too deare to shed it, I could rather wish Achilles the halfe god of your huge army, Had beene my opposite. Aia. Hee keepes his Tent In mournful passion that he mist the combate: But Hector, I shal giue thee cause to say, There's in the Greekish hoast a Knight a Prince, As Lyon hearted, and as Gyant strong As Thetis sonne: behold my warlicke Target Of pondrous brasse, quilted with seauen Oxe hides, Impenetrable, and so ful of weight, That scarse a Grecian (sane my selfe) can lift it: Yet can I vse it like a Summers fan, Made of the stately traine of Iuno's bird: My sword will bite the hardest Adamant. I'le with my Iauelin cleaue a rocke of Marble: Therefore though groar Achilles be not here, Thinke not braue cousen Hector but to finde, Achilles equal both in strength and minde. Alarum, in this combate both hauing lost their swords and Shields. Hector takes vp a great peece of a Rocke, and casts at Aiax; who teares a young Tree vp by the rootes, and assailes Hector, at which they are parted by both armes. Aga. Hold, you haue both shed blood too deare to loose, In single opposition. Par. Is your Champion, My cousen Aiax willing to leaue combate; Will hee first giue the word. Aia. Sir Paris no, 'Twas Hector challenge, and 'tis Hectors office, If we surcease on equal termes of valour, To giue the word. Hec. Then here's thy cousins hand, By Ioue thou hast a lusty pondrous arme: Thus till we meete againe, lets part both friends; For proofe whereof Aiax we'le interchange Somewhat betwixt vs, for alliance sake: Here take this sword and target, trust the blad, It neuer deceiu'd his maister. Aia. Take of me This purple studded belt, I won it cousen From the most valiant prince of Samothrace: And weare it for my sake. Enter an Herald. He. Priam vnto the Greekish General This profer makes. Because these blood-stayn'd fields Are ouer-spread with slaughter, to take truce Till all the dead on both sides be interr'd: Which if you grant, he here inuites the Generall, His nephew Aiax, and the great Achilles, With twenty of your chiefe selected Princes, To banquet with him in his royal Pallace: Those reuels ended, then to armes againe. Aga. A truce for burying of the slaughtred bodies We yeeld vnto: but for our safe returne From Troy and you, what pledges haue you found? Hec. You shal not need more then the faith of Hector For Priams pledge, King Agamemnon take My faith and honour, which if Priam breake, Ile breake the heart of Troy. Aga. We'le take your honor'd word, this night we'le part, To morrow morning when sit hower shal call, We'le meete King Priam neere his Citties wall. Exeunt. Explicit Actus secundus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius Scœna prima. Enter Thersites. Ther. Braue time, rare change, from fighting now to feasting: So many heauy blades to flye in peeces For such a peece of light flesh? what's the reason? A Lasse of my complexion, and this feature Might haue bin rapt, and stolne agayne by Paris, And none of all this stirre for't: but I perceiue Now all the World's turn'd wenchers, and in time All wenches will turne witches: but these Trumpets Proclaime their enter-view. A slourish. Enter all the Greekes on one side, all the Troians on the other: Euery Troian Prince intertaines a Greeke, and so march two and two, discoursing, as being conducted by them into the Citty. Ther. See here's the picture of a polliticke state, They all imbrace and hugge, yet deadly hate: They say their are braue Lasses in this Troy. What if Thersites sprucely smug'd himselfe, And striu'd to hide his hutch-backe: No not I. Tis held a rule, whom Nature markes in show And most deformes, they are best arm'd below. I'le not conceale my vertues: yet should I venter To damme my selfe for painting, fanne my face With a dyde Ostritch plume, plaster my wrinkles With some old Ladies Trowell, I might passe Perhaps for some maide-marrian: and some wench Wanting good eye-sight, might perhaps mistake me For a spruce Courtier: Courtier? tush, I from My first discretion haue abhor'd that name, Still suiting my conditions with my shape, And doe, and will, and can, when all else fayle: Though neither sooth nor speak wel: brauely rayle, And that's Thersites humour. Lowd Musicke. A long table, and a banquet in state, they are seated, a Troian and Greeke, Hecuba, Polixena, Cresida, and other Ladies waite, Calchas is present whispering with his Daughter Cresida. Pria. After so much hostility in steele, All welcome to this peacefull intertaine. Aga. Priam wee know thee to be honourable, Although our foe Treason is to be fear'd In Pesants not in Princes. They sit. Hec. Ey so, now sit, a Troian and a Greeke. Cousin Aiax neere mee, you are next in bloud, And neere mee you shall sit: the strayne of honour That makes you so renown'd, sprong, from Hesione. Tis part of Hectors bloud, your grosser spirits Lesse noble are your father Telamons. Welcome to Troy, and Hector, welcome all: Aiax. In Troy thy kinsman, but in field thy foe: Thy welcome Cousin here I pay with thanks, The truice expir'd, with buffets blowes and knocks. Hect. For that wee loue the Cuze. Achil. Me thinks this Troian Hector Out shines Achilles and his polisht honours Ecclipseth our bright glory, till hee set Wee cannot rise. Par. King Menelaus, we were once your guest, You now are ours, as welcome vnto Troy, As we to Sparta. Men. But that these our tongues Should be as well truce bound as our sharpe weapons, We could be bitter Paris: but haue done. Vlyss. Menelaus is discreet, such haynous wrongs Should be discours'd by Armes and not by tongues. Dio. Why doth Achilles eye wander that way? Achil. Is that a Troian Lady? Troi. Shee is. Achil. From whence? Pri. Of vs. Achil. Her name? Pri. Polyxena. Achil. Polixena? she hath melted vs within, And hath dissolu'd a spirit of Adamant. Shee hath done more then Hector and all Troy, Shee hath subdu'de Achilles. Cal. In one word this Troy shall be sackt and spoil'd, For so the gods haue told mee, Greece shall conquer. And they be ruin'd, leaue then imminent perill, And flye to safety. Cres. From Troilus? Cal. From destruction, take Diomed and liue, Or Troilus and thy death. Cres. Then Troilus and my ruine. Cal. Is Cresid mad? Wilt thou forsake thy father, who for thee and for thy safety hath forsooke his Countrey? Cres. Must then this Citty perish? Cal. Troy must fall. Cres. Alas for Troy and Troilus. Cal. Loue King Diomed A Prince and valiant, which made Emphasis To his Imperiall stile, liue Diomeds Queene, Be briefe, say quickly wilt thou? is it done? Cres. Diomed and you i'le follow, Troilus shun. Troi. Bee't Aiax, or Achilles, that Greeke lyes Who speakes it, i'le maintaine it on his person. Aiax. Ha Aiax! Achil. Achilles! Dio. We speake it, and dares Troilus fay we lie? Troi. And weare it Diomed. Dio. Dar'st thou make't good? Troi. On Diomed, or the boldest Greeke That euer manac'd Troy excepting none. All Greeks. None? All Troians. None. Hec. Excepting none. Aga. Kings of Greece. Pri. Princes of Troy. Achil. Achilles bafled? Aiax. And great Aiax brau'd? Hect. If great Achilles, Aiax, or the Diuel braue Troilus, hee shall braue and buffet thee. Pri. Sonnes. Aga. Fellow Kings. Pri. As wee are Priam and your father. Aga. As wee are Agamemnon Generall Turne not this banquet to a Centaus feast, If their be strife debate it in faire termes, Show your selnes gouern'd Princes. Achil. Wee are appeas'd. Aiax. Wee satisfied, if Hector be so. Aga. How grew this strife? Hect I know not, onely this I know. Troilus will maintaine nothing against his honour. And so farre, be it through the heart of Greece, Hector will backe him. Par. So will Paris too. Pri. Mildly discourse your wrongs, faire Princes doe. Troi. King Diomed maintaines his valour thus, He saith it was his Launce dismounted Troilus, And not the stumbling on the breathlesse course Of one new slaine that feld mee. Par. 'Tis false. Men. 'Tis true. Par. It was my fortune to make good that field, And hee fell iust before mee, Diomed then Was not within sixe speares length of the place. Men. How Troian rauisher? They all rise. Par. Call mee not Cuckold maker, I care not what you terme me. Men. I cannot brooke this wrong. Par. Say'st thou mee so madde Greeke? Pri. Paris. Aga. Gouerne you Kingdomes Lords, and cannot sway Your owne affection? Pri. Paris, forbeare. Mildly discourse, and gently wee shall heare. Par. I say King Diomed vnhorst not Troilus. Dio. How came I by his horse then? Par. As the vnbackt courser hauing lost his rider, Gallopt about the field you met with him, And catch'd him by the raine. Troi. Here was a goodly act To boast on, and send word to Cresida. Dio. Was no Prince neare when I encountred Troilus? Men. I was, and saw the speare of Diomed Tumble downe Troylus but peruse his armour, The dint's still in the vainbrace. Aga. Bee't so or not so, at this time forbeare To vrge extreames. Kings let this health go round, Pledge me King Priam in a cupful crown'd. Hec. Now after banquet, reuels: Musicke strike A pirhicke straiue, we are nor all for warre, Souldiers their stormy spirits can appease, And sometimes play the Courtiers when they please. A lofty dance of sixteene Princes, halfe Troians halfe Grecians. Pri. I haue obserued Achilles, and his eye Dwels on the face of faire Polixena. Aia. Why is not Hellen here at this high feast? I haue sweat many a drop of blood for her, Yet neuer saw her face. Achi. I could loue Hector, what's our cause of quarrel? For Hellens rape? that rape hath cost already Thousands of soules, why might not this contention 'Twixt Paris and the Spartan King be ended, And we leaue Troy with honour. Aia. Achilles how? Achi. Fetch Hellen hether, set her in the midst Of this braue ring of Princes, Paris here, And Menelaus heere: she betwixt both: They court her ore againe, whom she elects Before these Kings, let him inioy her still, For who would keepe a woman gainst her wil? Men. The names of wife and husband, th'interchange Of our two bloods in young Hermione, To whom we are ioynt parents, Hellens honor All pleade on my part, I am pleasde to stand To great Achilles motion. Par. So are we. All that I haue for comfort is but this, That in the day I show the properer man, Ith' night I please her better then hee can. Hec. Are all the Greecian Kings agreed to this? All. We are, we are. Hec. Place the two riuals then, each bide his fate, And vsher in bright Hellen in all state. The Kings promiscuously take their places, Paris and Menelaus are seated opposite, Hellen is brought in betwixt them by Hecuba and the Ladies. Hel. Oh that I were (but Hellen) any thing; Or might haue any obiect in my eye Saue Menelaus: when on him I gaze, My errour chides mee, I my shame emblaze. Mene. Oh Hellen, in thy cheeke thy guilt appeares, More I would speake, but words are drown'd in teares. Aia. A gallant Queene, for such a royall friend What mortall man would not with Ioue contend? Mene. Hellen the time was I might call thee wife, But that stile's changed; I, thou thy selfe art chang'd From what thou wast: and (most inconstant Dame) Hast nothing left thee, saue thy face and name. Pa. And I both these haue: hast thou not confest Faire Hellen, thy exchange was for the best. Mene. What can our Sparta value? Pa. Troy. Mene. You erre. Pa. who breathes that Sparta would 'fore Troy prefer. Mene. Thou hast left thy father Tendarus. Pa. To gayne King Priam, Lord of all this princely trayne. Mene. Thy mother Lada thou hast left who mournes, And with her piteous teares laments thy losse: Cannot this mooue thee? Hel. Oh I haue left my mother. Pa. No Hellen, but exchang'd her for another: Poore Læda, for rich Hecuba, a bare Queene For the great Asian Empresse. Men. From Castor and from Pollux thou hast rang'd Thy naturall brothers. Hel. True, true. Par. No, but chang'd, For Hector, Troilus, and the royall store Of eight and forty valiant brothers more. Men. If nothing else can moue thee Helena, Thinke of our daughter young Hermione. Hel. My deare Hermione. Men. Canst thou call her deare, And leaue that issue which thy wombe did beare? Shee's ours betwixt vs, canst thou? Par. Can shee? knowing, A sweeter babe within her sweete wombe growing Begot last night by Paris. Men. Looke this way Hellen, see my armes, spread wide, I am thine husband, thou my Spartan bride. Hel. That way? Par. My Hellen, this way turne thy sight, These are the armes in which thou layest last night. Hel. Oh how this Troian tempts mee! Men. This way wife, Thou shalt saue many a Greeke and Troians life. Hel. 'Tis true, I know it. Par. This way turne thine head, This is the path that leades vnto our bed. Hel. And 'tis a sweete smooth path. Men. Heere. Par. Heere. Men. Take this way Hellen, this is plaine &amp; euen. Par. That is the way to hell, but this to Heauen: Bright Comet shine this way. Men. Cleare starre shoot this, Here honour dwels. Par. Here many a thousand kisse. Hel. That way I should, because I know 'tis meerer. Men. Welcome. Hel. But I'le this way for Paris kisses sweeter. Par. And may I dye an Eunuch if ere morne I quit thee not. Men. I cannot brooke this scorne, Grecians to Armes. Hect. Then Greece from Troy deuide, This difference armes, not language most decide. All Greekes. Come to our Tents. All Troians. And wee to man the towne. Hect. These Tents shall swimme in bloud. Greekes. Blood Troy shall drowne. Exeunt diuers wayes. Achil. Yet shall no stroke fall from Achilles arme, Faire Polixena, so powerfull is thy charme. Alarme. Enter Troilus and Diomed. Troi. King Diomed! Dio. My riuall in the loue of Cresida. Troi. False Cresida, iniurious Diomed. Now shall I prooue in hostile enter-change Of warlike blowes that thou art all vnworthy The loue of Cresid. Dio. Why cam'st thou not on Horse-backe, That Diomed once againe dismounting thee Might greete his Lady with another course Wonne from the hand of Troilus. Troi. Diomed, By the true loue I beare that trothlesse Dame I'le winne thee, and send thy Horse and Armour Vnto the Tent of Cresid guard thy head, This day by mee thou shalt be captiue led. Alarme. They fight and are parted by the army, Diomed looseth his Helmet. Troi. Another Horse for Diomed to flye, Hee had neuer greater neede then now to runne. Though hee be fled yet Troilus this is thine, My Steed hee got by sleight, I this by force. I'le send her this to whom hee sent my horse. Enter Æneas and Achilles reading a Letter. Achil. Is this the answere of the note I sent To royall Priam and Queene Hecuba, Touching their daughter bright Polixena? Æne. Behold Queene Hecubaes hand, King Priams seale, With the consent of faire Polixena, Condition'd thus, Achilles shall forbeare To dammage Troy. Achi. Returne this answer backe, Tell Priam that Achilles Arme's benumb'd, And cannot lift a weapon against Troy. Say to Queene Hecuba wee are her sonne, And not Achilles, nor one Mirmidon Shall giue her least affront, as for the Lady Bid her presume, we henceforth are her Knight, And but for her, Achilles scornes to fight. Æne. Then thus saith Priam, but restraine thy powers, And as hee is a King, his daughter's yours. Achi. Farewell. Exit. Alarme. Enter Aiax. Aiax. Achilles, where's Achilles, what vnarm'd, when all the Champaigne where our battailes ioyne, Is made a standing poole of Greekish blood, Where horses plung'd vp to the saddle skirts, And men aboue the waste wade for their liues, And canst thou keepe thy Tent? Achi. My Lute Patroclus. A great Alarme. Enter Agamemnon. Aga. Let Greekes, kill Greekes, let's bend vnnaturall armes Against our owne brests, ere the conquering Troians Haue all the honour of this glorious day. Can our great Champion touch a womanish Lute, And heare the grones of twenty thousand soules Gasping their last breath? Achi. I can. Alarume. Enter Menelaus. Rescue, some rescue, the red field is strowd With Hectors honours and young Troilus spoyles. Achi. Yet all this moues not me. Alarum. Enter Vlysses. Ulyss. How long hath great Achilles bin surnam'd Coward in Troy, that Hector, Troilus, Paris, haue all that name so currant in their mouthes? I euer held him valiant, yet will Achilles fight? Achi. Vlysses, no, Beneath this globe Achilles hath no foe. Vlyss. Then here vnarm'd be slaine, think'st thou they'l spare Thee more then vs? Aiax. Or if thou wilt not arme thee, Let thy Patroclus lead thy Mirmidons, And weare thy Armour. Vlyss. Thy Armour is sufficient Without thy presence being fear'd in Troy. Achi. To saue our oath and keepe our Tents from sacke, Patroclus don our Armes, lead forth our guard, And wearing them by no Prince be out-dar'd. Patro. Achilles honours me, what heart can feare, And great Achilles sword proofe Armour weare? Exeunt all the Princes, enter Thersites. Ther. Where's this great sword and buckler man of Greece? Wee shall haue him one of sneakes noise, And come peaking into the Tents of the Greeks, With will you haue any musicke Gentlemen. Achi. Base groome, I'l teare thy flesh like falling Snow Ther. If I had Hectors face thou durst not doo't. Achi. Durst not? Ther. Durst not, hee's in the field, thou in thy Tent, Hector playing vpon the Greekish burgonets, Achilles fingring his effeminate Lute. And now because thou durst not meete him in the field, thou hast counterfeited an humour of loue. Achilles? Thou the Champion of Greece, a meere bug-beare, a scar-crow, a Hobby-horse. Achi. Vlisses taught thee this, deformed slaue. Ther. Coward thou durst not do this to Hector. Achi. On thee Ile practise, til I meete with him. The. Aiax is valiant, and in the throng of the Troians, Achilles is turn'd Fidler in the Tents of The Grecians. Alarum. Enter Diomed wounded, bringing in Patroclus dying. Dio. Looke here Achilles. Achi. Patroclus? Pat. This wound great Hector gaue: Reuenge my death, before I meete my graue. Enter Vlisses and Aiax wounded. Vlis. Yet will Achilles fight? see Aiax wounded, Two hundred of thy warlike Mirmedons Thou hast lost this day. Aia. Let's beate him to the field. Achi. Ha? Aia. Had I lost a Patroclus, a deere friend As thou hast done, I would haue dond these armes In which he dyed, sprung through the Troian hoast, And manger opposition, let the blow Or by the same hand dy'd: come ioyne with me, And we without this picture, statue of Greece, This shaddow of Achilles, will once more Inuade the Troian hoast. Achi. Aiax? Aia. Achilles? Achi. Wee owe thee for this scorne. Aia. I scorne that debt: Thou hast not fought with Hector. Achi. My honor and my oath both combate in mee: But loue swayes most. Alarum. Enter Menelaus and Agamemnon. Men. Our ships are fir'd, fiue hundred gallant vessels. Burnt in the Sea, halfe of our Fleete destroy'd, Without some present rescue. Achi. Ha, ha, ha. Aga. Doth no man aske where is this double fire, That two wayes flyes towards heauen? Vpon the right our royall Nauy burnes, Vpon the left, Achilles Tents on fire. Achi. Our Tent? Aga. By Ioue thy Tent, and all thy Mirmedons, Haue not the power to quench it: yet great Hector Hath shed more blood this day, then would haue seru'd To quench, both Fleete and Tent. Achi. My sword and armour: Polixena, thy loue we will lay by, Till by this hand, that Troian Hector dye. Aia. I knew he must be fired out. Exit. Alarum. Enter Hector, Paris, Troilus, Æneas, with burning staues and fire-bals. Al the Troians. Strike, stab, wound, kill, tosse firebrands, and make way. Hector of Troy, and a victorious day. Hec. Well fought braue brothers. Enter Aiax. Pa. What's hee? Troi. Tis Aiax, downe with him. Hec. No man presume to dart a feather at him Whilst we haue odds: cousen if thou seekest combate? See we stand single, not one Troian here, Shall lay a violent hand vpon thy life, Saue wee our selfe. Aia. Cousen th'art honorable, I now must both intreate and coniure thee, For my old Vncle Priams sake, his sister Hesione my mother, and thine Aunt: This day leaue thine aduantage, spare our Fleete, And let vs quench our Tents, onely this day Stay thy Victorious hand, tis Aiax pleades, Who but of Ioue hath neuer begg'd before, And saue of loue, will not intreate againe. Al Troians. Burne, still more fire. Hect. I'le quench it with his blood That addes one sparke vnto this kindled flame? My cousin shall not for Hesiones sake Be ought denide of Hector, she's our Aunt: Thou, then this day hast sau'd the Grecian Fleete: Let's sound retreat, whose charge made al Greece quak, We spare whole thousands for one Aiax sake. A Retreate sounded. Exeunt the Troians. Aia. Worthiest a liue thou hast, Greece was this day At her last cast, had they pursude aduantage: But I deuine, hereafter from this hower, We neuer more shal shrinke beneath their power. Exit.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus Scœna prima. Enter Hector, Troilus, Paris, Æneas, Hectors armour bearer, with others. Hec. My armour, and my trusty Galatee, The proudest steed that euer rider backt, Or with his hoofes beate thunder from the earth. The Sunne begins to mount the Easterne hill, And wee not yet in field: Lords yesterday Wee slipt a braue aduantage, else these ships That floate now in the Samothracian road, And with their wauing pendants menace Troy, Had with their flames reflecting from the Sea, Gilt those high towers, which now they proudly braue. Troi. On then; Achilles is vnconquered yet, Great Agamemnon and the Spartan King, Aiax the bigge-bond Duke of Salamine, With him that with his Lance made Venus bleed, The bold, (but euer rash) King Diomed. To lead these captiue through Scamander Plaines, That were a taske worth Hector. Par: Why not vs? Yet most becomming him, come then Æneas, Let each Picke one of these braue Champions out And single him a captiue. Æne. 'Twere an enterprise That would deserue a lasting Chronicle: Lead on renowned Hector. Hect. Vnnimble slaue, Dispatch, make hast, I would be first in field, And now I must be cal'd on. Enter Andromache and young Astianax. Andro. Oh stay deare Lord, my royall husband stay; Cast by thy shield, fellow vncase his armes, Knock off the riuets, lay that baldricke by, But this one day rest with Andromache. Hec. What meanest thou woman? Andro. To saue my hououred Lord From a sad fate, for if this ominous day, This day disastrous, thou appear'st in field I neuer more shall see thee. Hec. Fond Andromache. Giue me some reason for't. Andro. A fearefull dreame, This night me thought I saw thee 'mongst the Greekes Round girt with squadrons of thine enemies, All which their Iauelins thrild against thy brest, And stucke them in thy bosome. Hec. So many Squadrons, And all their darts quiuerd in Hectors brest, Some glanc't vpon mine armour, did they not? Par. Did none of all these darts rebound from Hector And hit thee sister, for (my Lasse) I know, Thou hast been oft hit by thiine Hector so. Andro. Oh doe not iest my husband to his death, I wak't and slept, and slept and wak't againe: But both my slumbers and my sounde sleepes Met in this one maine truth, if thou this day Affront their Army or oppose their fleete, After this day we ne're more shall meete. Hect. Trust not deceptious visions, dreame, are fables, Adulterate Sceanes of Anticke forgeries Playd vpon idle braines, come Lords to horse, To keepe me from the field, dreames haue no force. Andro. Troilus, Æneas, Paris, young Astianax, Hang on thy fathers armour, stay his speed. Asti. Father, sweete father do not fight to day. Hect. Helpe to take off these burrs, they trouble mee. Andro. Hold, hold thy father, if thou canst not kneele, Yet with thy teares intreate him stay at home. Asti. I'l hang vpon you, you shall beate me father Before I let you goe. Hect. How boy?

Hel. Paris sweete husband. Pa. Leaue your cunning Hellen. My brother shall to the field. Hel. But by this kisse thou shalt not. Pa. Now haue not I the heart to say her nay: This kisse hath ouercome mee. Andro. My dearest loue, Pitty your wife, your sonne, your father, all These liue beneath the safeguard of that arme; Pitty in vs whole Troy all ready doom'd To sinke beneath your ruine. Pri. If thou fall, Who then shall stand? Troy shall consume with fire (That yet remaines in thee) wee perish all, Or which is worse, led captiue into Greece: Therefore deare Hector, cast thy armour off. Andro. Husband. Hecu. Sonne. Hel. Brother. Hect. By Ioue I am resolu'd. Andro. Oh all yee gods! Hect. Not all the diuells Could halfe torment me like these women tongues? Pa. At my entreaty, and for Hellens loue, Leaue vs to beare the fortunes of this day, Heres Troilus and my selfe will make them sweare; Ere the fight end there are two Hectors here. Æne. Besides Æneas, and Deiphebus Young Margareton, and a thousand more Sworne to set fire on all their Tents this day, Then Hector for this once resolue to stay. Hect. To horse then Paris, do not linger time; Pa. To horse, come brother Troilus. Hect. Watch Margareton, if the youthfull Prince Venter beyond his strength, let him haue rescue. Troi. Hee shall be all our charge. Pri. Hector let's mount vpon the vvalls of Troy; And thence surueigh the battaile. Hect. Well bee't so. But if one Troian shall for succour cry. I'le leaue the walls and to his rescue flye. Exit. Enter Troilus and Diomed after an alarum. Troi. King Diomed. Dio. Cresids first loue. Troi. Yes Diomed and her last, I'le liue to loue her when thy life is past. Enter Menelaus both vpon Troilus. Men. Hold Troian, for no Greeke must be disarm'd: Enter Paris. Pa. Vnmanly odds, King Menelaus turne Thy face this way, 'tis Troian Paris calls. Men. Of all that breath, I loue that Paris tongue When it shall call to Armes: Now one shal downe. Alarum. Menelaus falls. Par. Thou keep'st thy word, for thou art downe indeed. Yet by the sword of Paris shalt not dye. I slew thy fame when I first stole thy Queene, And therefore Spartan will now spare thy life: Achilles, Diomed, Aiax, one of three Were noble prise, thou art no spoyle for mee. Alarum. Enter aboue Priam, Hector, Astianax, Hecuba, Hellen, &amp;c. Below Achilles and Margareton. Achil. If thou bee'st noble by thy blood and valour, Tell mee if Hector bee in field this day. Marg. Thy coniuration hath a double spell, Hector is not in field, but here I stand Thy warlike opposite. Achi: Thou art young and weake, retire and spare thy life. Mar. I'm Hectors brother, none of Hectors blood Did euer yet retreite. Achi. If Hectors friend, Here must thy life and glory both haue end. Achilles kils him. Hec. Oh father, see where Margareton Iyes, Your sonne, my brother by Achilles slaine. Pri. Thy brother Troylus will reuenge his death: But Hector shall not mooue. Hec. Troylus nor all the Troians in the field Can make their swords bite on Achilles shield: 'Tis none but Hector must reuenge his death. Pri. But not this day. Hect. Before the Sunne decline, That terrour of the earth I'le make deuine. Exit from the wals. Alarum. Enter Hector beating before him Achilles Mermidons. Hect. Thus flyes the dust before the Northern winds, And turnes to Attoms dancing in the ayre, So from the force of our victorious arme, Flye armed squadrons of the boldest Greekes, And mated at the terrour of our name, So cleare the field before me, no mans fauour'd: The blood of three braue Princes in my rage, I haue sacrific'd to Margaritons soule. Aiax Oilæus, Aiax Telamon, Merionus, Menelaus, Idomea, Arch-dukes and Kings haue shrunke beneath this arme, Besides a thousand Knights haue falne this day Beneath the fury of my pondrous blowes: And not the least of my victorious spoyles, Quiuer'd my Iauelin through the brawny thigh Of strong Achilles, and I seeke him still, Once more to tug with him: my sword and breath Assist me still, till one drop downe in death. Enter Achilles with his guard of Mermidons. Achi. Come cast your selues into a ring of terrour, About this warlike Prince, by whom I bleede: Hec. What meanes the glory of the Grecian hoast, Thus to besiege me with his Mermidons? And keepe aloofe himselfe. Achil. That shall my Launce In bloody letters text vpon thy breast, For young Patroclus death, for my dishonours, For thousand spoyles, and for that infinite wracke Our Army hath indur'd onely by thee, Thy life must yeeld me satisfaction. Hec. My life? aud welcome, by Apolloes fire, I neuer ventred blood with more content, Then against thee Achilles, come prepare. Achil. For eminent death, you of my warlike guard, My Mermidons, for slaughters most renown'd, Now sworne to my designements, your steele polaxes, Fixe all at once, and girt him round with wounds. Hec. Dishonourable Greeke, Hector nere dealt On base aduantage, or euer lift his sword Ouer a quaking toe, but as a spoyle Vnworthy vs, still left him to his feare: Not on the man, whom singly I struke downe, Haue I redoubled blowes, my valour still Opposde against a standing enemy. Thee haue I twice vnhorst, and when I might Haue slaine thee groueling, left thee to the field, Thine armour and thy shield impenetrable, Wrought by the god of Lemnos in his forge By arte diuine, with the whole world ingrauen, I haue through pierc't, and still it weares my skarres: Forget not how last day, euen in thy tent I feasted my good sword, and might haue flung My bals of wild-fire round about your Fleete, To haue sent vp your Greekish pride in flames, Which would haue fixt a starre in that high Orbe, To memorize to all succeeding times Our glories and your shames, yet this I spar'd, And shall I now be slayne by treachery? Achi Tell him your answer on your weapons points, Vpon him my braue souldiers. Hec. Come you slaues, Before I fall, Ile make some food for graues, That gape to swallow cowards: ceaze you dogges. Vpon a Lyon with your armed phangs, And bare me brauely, where I touch I kill, And where I fasten teare body from soule, And soule from hope of rest: all Greece shall know, Blood must run wast in Hectors ouerthrow. Alarum. Hector fals slayne by the Mermidons, then Achilles wounds him with his Launce. Achi. Farwell the noblest spirit that ere breath'd In any terrene mansion: Take vp his body And beare it to my Tent: Ile straight to horse, And at his fetlockes to my greater glory, Ile dragge his mangled trunke that Grecians all, May deafe the world with shouts, at Hectors fall. Enter Priam, Æneas, Troilus, Paris. Pri. Blacke fate, blacke day, be neuer Kallendred Hereafter in the number of the yeare, The Planets cease to worke, the Spheares to mooue, The Sunne in his meridian course to shine, Perpetuall darknesse ouerwhelme the day, In which is falne the pride of Asia. Troi. Rot may that hand. And euery ioynt drop peece-meale from his arme, That tooke such base aduantage on a worthy, Who all aduantage scorn'd. Pa. Yet though his life they haue basely tane away, His body we haue rescued mauger Greece. And Paris, I the meanest of Priams sonnes, Haue made as many Mermidons weepe blood, As had least finger in the VVorthies fall. Pri. VVhat but his death could thus haue arm'd my hand, Or drawne decreeped Priam to the field: That starre is shot, his luster quite ecclips'd: And shall we now, surrender Hellena? Pa. Not till Achilles lye as dead as Hector, And Aiax by Achilles, not whilst Islium Hath one stone rear'd vpon anothers backe To ouer-looke these wals, or those high wals To ouer-peere the plaine. Troi. Contrary Elements, The warring meteors: Hell and Elizium Are not so much oppos'd, as Troy and Greece, For Hector, Hectors death. Par. A most sad Funerall Will his in Troy be, where shall scarce an eye Of twice two hundred thousand be found drye: These obets once past o're, which we desire, Those eyes that now shed water, shall speake fire. Æne. Now sound retreate. Pri. Wee backe to Troy returne, Where euery soule in funeral black shall mourne. Exit. Par. Hector is dead, and yet my brother Troilus A second terrour to the Greekes still liues. In him there's hope since all his Mermidons Hauing felt his fury, flye euen at his name. But must the proud Achilles still insult And tryumph in the glory of base deedes? No, Hector hee destroy'd by treachery, And hee must dye by craft. But Priams temper Will nere bee brought to any base reuenge: A woman is most subiect vnto spleene, And I will vse the braine of Hecuba: This bloody sonne of Thetis doth still doate Vpon the beauty of Polexina; And that's the base we now must build vpon. My mother hath by secret letters wrought him Once more to abandon both the field and armes: The plot is caft, which if it well succeede, He that's of blood insatiate, must next bleed. Exit. Achilles discouered in his Tent, about him his bleeding Mermidons, himselfe wounded, and with him Vilisses. Vlis. Why will not great Achilles don his Armes, And rowse his bleeding Mirmidons? shall Troilus March backe to Troy with armour, sword, and lance, All dyde in Grecian blood? shall aged Priam Boast in faire Islium that the sonne of Thetis, Whose warlike speare pierc't mighty Hectors brest, Lies like a coward slumbring in his Tent, Because hee feares young Troilus. Achi. Pardon mee, Vlisses, here's a Briefe from Hecuba, Wherein shee vowes, if I but kill one Troian, I neuer shall inioy Polixena. Ulis. But thinks Achilles, if the Greekes be slaine, And forc't perforce to march away from Troy, That hee shall then inioy Polixena? No, 'tis King Priams subtilty, whilst thou Sleep'st in thy Tent, Troilus through all our Troups Makes Lanes of slaughtered bodies, and will tosse His Balls of wild-fire as great Hector did O're all our nauall forces: But did this Prince Lye breathlesse bleeding at Achilles feet, Dispairing Priam would to make his peace Make humbly tender of Polixena, And be much proud to call Achilles sonne? Achi. Were Troilus slaine? Vlis. Who else deales wounds so thicke and fast as hee, They call him Hectors ghost, he glides so quicke Through our Battalions: If hee beate vs hence, And wee bee then compel'd to sue to them? It will be answer'd, that great Hectors deaths-man Shall neuer wedd his sister: Hectors sonne Will neuer kneele to him, by whose strong hand His father fell; but were young Troilus slaine, And Priams sonnes sent wounded from the field, Troy then would stoope, and send Polixena Euen to Achilles Tent. Achi. My sword and armour, Arise my bleeding ministers of death, I'le feast you with an Ocean of blood-royalle. Vlysses, ere this Sunne fall from the skies, By this right hand the warlike Troilus dyes. Alarum. Enter Troilus and Thersites. Ther. Hold if thou bee'st a man. Troi. Stand if thou bee'st a souldier, do not shrinke. Ther. Art not thou Troilus, yong and lusty Troilus. Troi. I am, what then? Ther. And I Thersites, lame and impotent, What honour canst thou get by killing mee? I cannot fight. Troi. What mak'st thou in the field then? Ther. I came to laugh at mad-men, thou art one; The Troians are all mad, so are the Greeks To kill so many thousands for one drabbe, For Hellen: a light thing, doe thou turne wise And kill no more; I since these warres began Shed not one drop of blood. Troi. But proud Achilles Slew my bold brother, and you Grecians all Shall perish for the noble Hectors fall. Ther. Hold, the Pox take thee hold, whilst I haue breath, I am bound to curse thy fingers. Enter Achilles with his Mirmidons, after Troilus hath beaten Thersites. Achil. I might haue slaine young Troilus when his sword, Late sparkled fire out of the Spartans helme, But that had stild my fame, but I will trace him Through the whole Army, when I meete the Troian Breathlesse and faint: Ile thunder on his crest Some valour, but aduantage likes mee best. Enter Troilus. Troi. Let Cowards fight with Cowards, and both feare, The base Thersites is no match for mee, Oppose mee to the proudest hee in field, Most eminent is Armes and best approu'd, To make the thirsty after blood to bleed, And that's the proud Achilles. Achi. Who names vs? Troi. Fate, thou hast now before me set the man Whom I most sought, to thee whom I will offer To appease Hectors ghost a sacrifice. You widdowed Matrons who now mourne in teares, And all you watry eyes surcease to weepe. Fathers that in this warre haue lost your sonnes, And sonnes your fathers, by Achilles hand; No more lament vpon their funerall Armes, But from this day reioyce: posterity From age to age this to succession tell, Hee falls by Troilus, by whom Hector fall. Achi. Hectors sad fate betyde him, souldiers on, Both brothers shew like mercy, thy vaine sound That boasted lyes now leuel'd with the ground. Troilus is slaine by him and the Mirmidons. Enter Thersites. Ther. Achilles! Achi. What's hee? Thersites! Ther. Thou art a coward. Achi. Haue I not sau'd thy life, and slaine proud Troilus By whom the Greekes lye pilde in breathlesse heapes? Ther. Yes when he was out of breath so thou slewest Hector Girt with thy Mirmidons. Achi. Dogged Thersites, I'le cleaue thee to thy Nauell if thou op'st Thy venemous Iawes. Ther. Doe, doe, good Dog-killer. Achi. You slaue. Ther. I am out of breath now too, else bug-bate Greeke Thou durst not to haue touch't mee. Achilles beates him off, retreate sounded. Enter Agamemnon, Aiax, Vlysses, &amp;c. all the other but Paris. Agam. To whom dost thou addresse thine Embasie? Par. To Achilles. Aga. And not the Generall? It concernes our place To heare King Priams embasie. Pa. Let mee haue passage to Achilles Tent, There Agamemnon (if you please) may heare What Priam sends to your great Champion. Aga. Let it bee so, Aiax. The Generall wrongs that honour Wee Princes in our loue conferre on him. Had I th' imperiall mandat in my mouth, I would not loose one jot of my command For all the proud Achilles's on earth, Take him at best hee's but a fellow peere, And should lift his head aboue the Clouds I hold my selfe his equall. Enter Achilles from his Tent. Achi. Vntuterd Aiax. Aia. Who spake that word? Achi. 'Twas I Achilles, let the sonne of Priam Bee priuat with vs. Aga. It belongs to vs To bee partakers of his Embasie. Achi. Dismisse then our Inferiours, you Ulisses Are welcome, Menelaus, Diomed. Let Aiax stay without, and know his duty. Exit. Aiax. Duty? Oh you gods! Ha? in what Dialect spake hee that language Which Greece yet neuer knew, wee owe to him? I'le after him and dragge him from his Tent, And teach the insolent, manners: Giue mee way, Ulisses, thou and all the world shal know, That saue the obedience that I owe the gods, And duty to my father Telamon, Aiax knowes none, no not to Agamemnon: For what hee hath of mee's my courtesie, What hee claimes else, or the proud'st Greeke that breaths, I'le pay him in the poor'st and basest scorne Contempt was ere exprest in. Vlis. Aiax you are too bold with great Achilles, You beare your selfe more equall then you ought, With one so trophy'd. Aia. Bold? oh my merits, Are you so soone forgot? why King of Ithaca, What hath this Toy (aboue so talkt of) done, Sauing slaine Hector, which at best receiu'd Was but scarse fairely, which the common tongues, Voyces, with base aduantage. Vlis. Yes, Prince Troilus Surnam'd the second Hector, lyeth imbak'd In his cold blood, slayne by Achilles hand: The streame of glory now runnes all towards him: Achilles lookes for't Aiax. Aia. But when Achilles slumbred in his Tent, Or waking with his Lute courted the ayre; Then Aiax did not beare himselfe too bold With this great Champion: when I sau'd our Fleete From Hectors wild-fire, I deseru'd some prayse, But then your tongues were mute. Vlis. You in these times Did not affect ostent, but still went on: But Thetis sonne lookes for a world of sound. To spread his attributes. Aia. The proud Achilles Shall not out-shine me long, in the next battaile, If to kill Troians bee to dim his prayse, I'le quench his luster by my bloody rayes. Enter Agamemnon, Achilles, Diomed, Menelaus and Paris, &amp;c. Pa. Shall I returne that answere to King Priam? Achi. Say in the morning we will visite him: So beare our kind regreetes to Hecuba. Aia. But will Achilles trust himselfe with Priam, Whose warlike sonnes were by his valour slaine? Achi. Priam is honourable, see here's his hand, His Queene religious, and behold her name: Polixena deuine, reade here, her vowes, Honor, religions, and diuinity, All ioyntly promising Achilles safety: Paris, you heare our answere, so returne it. Pa. We shal receiue Achilles with al honor. Exit. Mene. Were I Achilles and had slaine great Hector, With valiant Troilus, Priams best lou'd sonnes, I for the brightest Lady in all Asia, Would not so trust my person with the father. Achi. I am resolu'd, Vlysses you once told mee Priam would sleepe if Troilus once were slayne. Ulyss. And I dare gage my life, the reuerent King Intends no treason to Achilles person, But meerely by this honourable League, To draw our warlike Champion from the field. Achi. But we'le deceiue his hopes: feare not great Kings, When so my Tent I bring Polixena: The sooner Troy lyes leuell with the ground. You vnderstand me Lords; shall I intreate you Associate me vnto the sacred Temple Of Diuine Phæbus? Aga. In me these Kings shall answere, wee in peace Will bring Achilles to Apolloes shrine, Prouided, Priam ere we enter Troy, Will giue vs hostage for our safe returne. Achi. My honour'd hand with his. Exeunt. Enter Paris and Hecuba. Hecu. Oh Paris, till Achilles lye as dead, As did thy brother Hector at his feete, His body hackt with as many wounds, As was thy brother Troilus when he fell. I neuer, neuer shall haue peace with Heauen, Or take thee for their brother, or my sonne. Par. Mother I hate Achilles more then you; But I haue heard hee is invulnerable: His mother Thetis from the Oracle Receiuing answere, hee should dye at Troy; (Being yet a childe,) and to preuent that fate, She dipt him in the Sea, all saue the heele: These parts she drencht, remayne impenetrable; But what her dainty hand (forbore to drowne) As loath to feele the coldnesse of the waue, That, and that onely may bee pierc'd with steele. Now since I know his fellow Kings intend, To be his guard to Islium: what's my rage? Or this my weapon to destroy a Prince, Whose flesh no sword can bite off. Hecu. Haue I not heard thee Paris, praise thy selfe For skill in Archery? haue I not seene A shaft sent leuell from thy constant hand, Command the marke at pleasure? maist not thou With such an arrow, and the selfe-same bow, Wound proud Achilles in that vndrencht part, And by his heele draw lines blood from his heart? Par. Well thought on, the rare cunning of this hand; None saue the powers immortall can with stand: When in the Temple hee shall thinke to imbrace My sister Polixena. Ile strike him there. The Greekes are entred Troy. Let's fill the trayne To auoyde suspect, and now my shaft and bow, Greece from my hand, receiue thine ouerthrow. Enter at one doore Priam, Hecuba, Paris, Æneas, Antenor, Deiphobus, Hellena, and Polixena. At the other, Agamemnon, Achilles, Menelaus, Vlisses, Diomed, Thersites, and Aiax. They interchange imbraces, Polixena is giuen to Achilles, &amp;c. Pri. Though the dammage you haue done to Troy, Might cease our armes, and arme our browes with wrath, Yet with a smooth front, and heart vnfeigned, Now bid Achilles welcome; welcome all Before these Kings, and in the sight of Hellen, The dearest of my daughters Polixen I tender thee: on to Apolloes shrine, The flamin stayes: these nuptiall rights once past, You of our best varieties shall taste. Exeunt. Paris fetcheth his Bow and arrowes. Par. My bow! now thou great god of Archery, The Patron of our action and our vowes, Direct my shaft to wound bright Thetis sonne, And let it not offend thy deity, That in thy Temple I exhaust his blood, Without respect of place, reuenge seemes good. Exit. A great crye within. Enter Paris. Par. Tis done, Achilles bleedes, immortal powers Clap hands, and smile to see the Greeke fall dead, By whom the valiant Hectors blood was shed. Enter all the Troians, and the Greekes bringing in Achilles with an arrow through his heele. Aga. Priam, thou hast dishonourably broake The Lawes of Armes. Pri. By all the gods I vowe, I was a stranger to this horrid act: It neuer came from Priam. Vlyss. Call for your Surgeon then to stop his wound. Mene. For if hee dye, it will be registred For euer to thy shame. Pri. A Surgeon there. Achi. It is in vaine for liue, that god of Physicke We Grecians honor in a Serpents shape; He could not stanch my blood: know fellow Kings My mother Thetis by whose heauenly wisdome, My other parts were made invulnerable. Could not of all the gods obtayne that grace, But that my blood, vented as now it is, The wound should be incureable: what Coward That durst not looke Achiles in the face, Hath found my liues blood in this speeding place? Par. 'Twas I, 'twas Paris. Aiax. 'Twas a milke-sop then. Diom. A Traytor to all Valour. Par. Did not this bleeding Greeke kil valiant Hector, Incompast with his Guard of Mermidons? Pri. Degenerate Paris, not old Priams sonne, Thou neuer took'st thy treacherous blood from me. Aia. How cheeres Achiles, though thy too much pride Which held the heart of Aiax from thy loue, He'le be the formost to reuenge thy death. Achil. Gramercy noble Aiax, Agamemnon, Vlisses, Diomed, I feele my strength Begins to fayle, let me haue buriall, And then to Armes, reuenge Achilles death: Or if proud Troy remayne inuincible, To Lycomedes send to youthfull Pirhus, My sonne begot on bright Dedamia; And let him force his vengeance through the hearts Of these, by whom his father was betray'd. I faint, may euery droppe of blood I shed, Exhald by Phæbus, putrifie the ayre, That euery soule in Asia that drawes breath, May poysoned dye for great Achilles death. Aga. He's dead, the pride of all our Grecian army. Vlyss. Will Priam let vs beare his body hence? Par. Yes, and not drag it 'bout the wals of Troy. As hee did Hectors basely. Pri. Take it, withall truce, time to bury it. Aga. Come Princes, on your shoulders beare him then, Brauest of souldiers, and the best of men. They beare him off. And to Priam enter Æneas. Æne. Where's mighty Priam? Pri. What's the newes Æneas? Æne. Such as will make your highnes doff your age And be as youthfull spirited as the Spring: Penthisilea Queene of Amazons, With mighty troopes of Virgin warriers, Gallant Veragoes, for the loue of Hector, And to reuenge his death, are entred Troy. May it please you, to receiue the Scitbean Queene. Pri. What Troy can yeeld, or Priam can expresse, The Amazonian Princesse shall pertake: Come Hecuba, and Ladies, let's prepare, To bid her friendly welcome to this warre. Explicit Actus quartus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus Scœna prima. Enter Thersites with Souldiers, bringing in a table, with chayres and stooles plac'd about it. Ther. Come, come, spread, spread, vp with the pulpets straight, Seates for the Iudges, all the Kings of Greece. Why when you lazy drudges? Is this place For a whole Iury royall? where's the Armour, The prize for which the crafty Fox Vlisses, And mad Bull Aiax, must this day contend? What, is all ready? rare world, when insteade Of smooth tong'd Lawyers, Souldiers now must pleade. Loud Musicke. Enter all the Kings of Greece, the Armour of Achilles, borne betwixt Vlysses and Aiax, and plac'd vpon the table, the Princes seate themselues, a chayre is plac'd at eyther end of the Stage, the one for Aiax, the other for Vlysses. Aga. This Sessions valiant Duke of Salamine, And King of Ithaca was cald for you: Since great Achilles armour is the prise, Due to the worthier, heere before these Kings, And in the face of all the multitude, You are appoynted for your seuerall pleaes, That prince who to these armes can prooue most right, Shall weare his purchase in the armies sight. Aia. If to the worthiest they belong to mee: Could you select 'mongst all this throng of Princes, None worthier then Vlisses, to contend VVith Aiax? and in viewe of all our Nauy, Of all these tall ships, gilt with Hectors flames, VVhich when Vlisses fled into his tent, I, I extinguisht, these twelue hundred ships I sau'd at once, deseru'd Achilles armes, Laertes sonne may thinke it grace enough, That though hee misse his ayme, hee may be sayd To haue stroue with Aiax: Aiax who excels As much in armes, as hee in eloquence. My hands performe more then his tong can speake, Act more then hee can talke: were I lesse valiant, And had but halfe my vigour (like him) weake, My royall birth would for this armour speake. Duke Telamon, that in the Argoe sayl'd To Calchos: and in Isliums second sacke, First rear'd Alcides colours on the VVals My father was: His father Eacus, On of the three that iudge infernall soules; And Eacus was sonne to Iupiter. Thus am I third from Ioue; besides Achilles By marriage was my brother, and I craue, Since hee is dead my brothers armes to haue. VVhat hath Vlisses with our Kin to doe? Beeing a stranger, not of Peleus blood: Graue Heroes, if not honour, prize my merit, I pleade both worth and blood, these armes to inherit. Mene. Beleeue me, two sound pleas on Aiax part, I feare the prize will bee conferr'd on him. Dio. His arguments are maximes, and sound proofes To winne him way, into the souldiers hearts. Agam. Let him proceede. Aia Because I hasted to the siege of Troy, When hee feign'd madnes, must hee weare these armes? When in the Phalanx, with old Nestor charging, Thou at the name of Hector fledst the fielde, And left the good old man incompast round, Calling aloud Vlisses, Vlisses stay, The more hee cry'd the more thou mad'st thy way. Prince Diomed you saw it, and vpbrayded This Ithacans base flight, but see Heauens Iustice. Old Nestor scapt, great Hector was not there; But meetes Vlisses, as hee fled from Hector, Hee that but late denide helpe, now wants helpe, For at the sight of Hector downe he fals, And cryes aloud for ayde, I came, and saw thee Quaking with terrour vnder Hectors arme, The pondrous blow I tooke vpon my Targe, And as the least of all my noble deedes, Sau'd these faint limbes from slaughter, which now sue, To don these glorious armes, nor doe I blame thee Forfearing Hector: what is hee of Greece That sauing Aiax, quakt not at his name? Yet did I meete that Hector guil'd in blood Of Grecian Princes, fought with him so long, Till all the hoast deaft with our horrid stroakes, Begirt vs with amazement: wilt thou know My honour in this combate? it was this, I was not conquered: if thou still contendest? Imagine but that field, the Time, the foes, Hector aliue, thee quaking at his feete, And Aiax interposing his broad shield 'Twixt death and thee, and thou the armes must yeeld. Diom. What can the wise Vlisses, say to this? Aiax preuailes much with the multitude, The generall murmur doth accord with him. Men. I euer thought the sonne of Telamon Did better merit th' Achillean Armes Then the Dulichian King. Agam. Forbeare to censure. Till both be fully heard. Aiax. Me thinkes graue Heroes, you should seeke an Aiax To weare these Armes, not let these Armes be sought By Aiax: what hath slye Vlisses done To counteruaile my acts? kild vnarm'd Rhesus, And set on sleepie Dolon in the night, Stolne the Palladium from the Troian Fane. Oh braue exploits; nor hast thou these perform'd Without the helpe of warlike Diomed: So you betwixt you should deuide these spoyles. Alas thou knowst not what thou seekst, fond man, Thou that fightst all by craft and in the night The radiant splendor of this burnisht Helme Shining in darknesse, as the Sun by day, Thy theeuish spoyles and ambush would betray. Thy politicke head's too weake to beare this caske, This massie Helme; thou canst not mount his Speare, His warlike shield that beares the world ingrauen Will tire thine arme, foole thou dost aske a Speare, A shield a caske, thou hast not strength to weare. Now if these Kings, or the vaine peoples errour So farre should erre from truth to giue them thee, Twould be a meanes to make thee sooner dye: The weight would lagge thee that art wont to flye: Thou hast a shield vnscar'd, my seuen-fold Targe With thousand gashes peece-meald from mine arme, And none but that would fit mee: To conclude, Go beare these Armes for which we two contend Into the mid-ranks of our enemies, And bidde vs fetch them thence, and he to weare them By whom this royall Armour can be wonne, I had rather fight then talke, so I haue done. A loud shout within crying Aiax, Aiax: Ulis. If with your prayers oh Grecian Kings, my vowes Might haue preuail'd with Heauen, there had bin then No such contention, thou hadst kept thine Armes, And wee Achilies thee: But since the Fates Haue tane him from vs, who hath now more right To claime these Armes he dead, then hee that gaue them Vnto Achilles liuing? nor great Princes, Let that smooth eloquence, yon fellow scornes, (If it bee any) bee reiected now, And hurt his maister, which so many times Hath profited whole Greece, if we plead blood Which is not ours, but all our Ancestours. Laertes was my father, his Arcesius, His Ioue, from whom I am third: beside I claime A second god-head by my mothers name. What doe wee talke of birth? If birth should beare them, His father being nearer Ioue then hee Should weare this honour, or if next of blood, Achilles father Peleus should inioy them, Or his sonne Pirhus; but wee plead not kinred, Or neare propinquity: let alliance rest, His bee the Armour that deserues it best. Achilles mother Thetis being foretold Her sonne should die at Troy, conceal'd him from vs In habite of a Lady, to this siege I brought him, therefore challenge all his deeds As by Vlisses done: 'Twas I sack't Thebes, Chriscis, and Scylla, with Lernessus walls, I Troilus and renowned Hector slew: First with this Helmet I adorn'd his head, Hee gaue it liuing, who demands it dead? Dio. 'Tis true, for like a Pedler being disguis'd, And comming where Achilles spent his youth In womanish habite, the young Ladyes they Looke on his Glasses, Iewells and fine toyes: Hee had a Bow too much Achilles drew, So by his strength the Ithacan him knew. Had Aiax gone, Achilles then had stay, Hector still liu'd, our ransack't Tents to inuade: What canst thou doe but barely fight? no more; I can both fight and counsell, I direct The manner of our battailes, and propose For victuall and munition, to supply The vniuersall hoast, cheere vp the souldiers To indure a tedious siege, when all the Army Cry'd let's away for Greece, and rais'd their Tents. Aiax amongst the formost had trust vp His bagge and baggage: when I rated him, And them, and all, and by my Oratory Perswaded their retreat: What Greece hath wonne From Troy since then, is by Vlisses done. Behold my wounds oh Grecians, and iudge you If they be cowards marks th'are in my brest: Let boasting Aiax shew such noble skarres. These Grecian Heroes tooke I in your warres. I grant hee fought with Hector, 'twas well done, Where thou deseru'st well I will giue thee due, But what was the successe of that great day? Hector of Troy vnwounded went away. Men. Now sure the prise will to Vlisses fall, The murmuring souldiers mutter his deserts, Preferring him fore Aiax: heare the rest. Vlis. But oh Achilles, when I view these Armes, I cannot but lament thine obsequies: Thou wall of Greece, when thou wast basely slaine I tooke thee on my souldiers, and from Troy Bore thee then arm'd in the abillements I once more seeke to beare, behold that shield. Tis a description Cosmographicall Of all the Earth, the Ayre, the Sea and Heauen, What are the Hyades? or grim Orion; Hee pleads, or what's Arcton? thy rude hand Would lift a shield, thou canst not vnder stand: To omit my deeds of Armes, which all these know Better then I can speake. When in the night I venter'd through Troyes gates, and from the Temple Rap't the Palladium, then I conquerd Troy, Troy whilst that stood could neuer be subdu'd, In that I brought away their gods, their honours, Troyes ruine and the triumphs of whole Greece. What hath blunt Aiax done to conteruaile This one of mine? Hee did with Hector fight, I tenne yeeres warre haue ended in one night. What Aiax did was but by my direction, My counsell fought in him, and all his honours (If they be any,) hee may thankc mee for What hee hath done, was since his flight I stayd, I therefore claime these Armes: so I haue sayd. A shout within Vlisses, Vlisses. The Princes rise. Agam. Such is the clamour of the multitude, And such Ulisses are your great deserts, That those rich Armes are thine, the prize inioy Vlis. To the defence of Greece and sack of Troy. Dio. Come Princes, now this striffe is well determin'd. Men. To see how eloquence the people charmes, Ulisses by his tongue hath gain'd these Armes. Agam. Counsell preuailes 'boue strength, Heralds proclaime Through the whole Campe Vlisses glorious name. Exeunt. The Armes borne in triumph before Vlisses. Aiax. What dream'st thou Aiax? Or is this obiect reall that I see, Which topsiturnes my braine, base Ithaca To sway desert thus: Oh that such rich Troophies Should cloath a cowards backe, nor is it strange; I'le goe turne coward too, and henceforth plot, Turne politicians all, all politicians. A rush for valour, valour? this is the difference 'Twixt the bold warrier, and the cunning states-man, The first seekes honour, and the last his health: The valiant hoord the knocks, the wise the wealth. It was a gallant Armour, Aiax limbs Would haue become it brauely; the disgrace Of loosing such an Armour by contention, Will liue to all posterity, and the shame In Stigian Lethe drowne great Aiax name. Oh that I had heere my base opposite, In th' Achillean Armour briskly clad, Vulcan that wrought it out of gadds of Steele With his Ciclopian hammers, neuer made Such noise vpon his Anvile forging it, Then these my arm'd fists in Vlisses wracke, To mould it new vpon the cowards backe. Enter Thersites. Ther. Why how now mad Greeke? Aia. And art thou come Ulisses? thus, and thus I'le hammer on thy proofe steel'd Burganet. Aia. Hold Aiax, hold, the diuell take thee, hold; I am Thersites, hell rot thy fingers off. Aia. But art not thou Ulisses? Ther: No I tell thee. Aia. And is not thine head arm'd? Ther. Hells plagues confound thee, no; thou think'st thou Hast Menelaus head in hand, I am Thersites. Aia. Thersites? Canst thou rayle? Ther. Oh yes, yes; better then fight. Aia. And curse? Ther. Better then either: rarely. Aia. And spit thy venome in the face of Greece? Ther. Admirably. Aia. Doe, doe, let's heare, prethee for heauens sake doe. Ther. With whom shall I begin? Aia. Beginne with the head. Ther. Then haue at thee Menelaus, thou art a king and a— No more, but if on any, rayle on mee. Desert should still be snarl'd at, vice posse free. Ther. Who thou the son of Telamon, thou art a foole, An Asse, a very blocke. What makest thou here at Troy to ayde a Cuckold, beeing a Bachelour? Paris hath stolne no wife of thine: if Aiax Had beene ought but the worst of these, he might Haue kept his Country, solac'd his father, and Comforted his mother: what thankes hast thou For spending thy meanes, hazarding thy souldiers? Wasting thy youth, loosing thy blood, Indangering thy life? and all for a— Aiax. Peace. Ther. Yes peace for shame, But what thankes hast thou for all thy trauaile? Vlisses hath the armour, and what art thou now Reckoned? a good moyle, a horse that knowes Not his owne strength, an Asse fit for seruice, And good for burthens, to carry gold, and to Feede on thistles: farwell Coxe-combe. I shall be Held to bee a Cocke of the same dunghill, For bearing thee company so long, Ile to Vlisses. Aia. Base slaue, thou art for Cowards, not for men Ile stown'd thee if thou com'st not backe againe: This vantage haue the valiant of the base, Death, which they coldly feare, we boldly imbrace. Helpe me to rayle on them too, or thou dyest. Ther. Do't then, whilst tis hot. Aia. What's Agamemnon our great Generall? Ther. A blind Iustice, and I would he had kist Fortunes blind cheekes, when hee could not see To doe thee Iustice. Aia. Well, and what's Menelaus? Ther. A King and a Cuckold, and a horne-plague Consume him. Aia. Amen. What's Diomed? he sat on the bench too. Ther. A very bench-whistler: and loues Cresida. Hell and confusion swallow him. Aia. Amen. Amongst these what's Thersites? Ther. A Rogue, a rayling Rogue, a Curr, a barking Dog, the Pox take mee else. Aia. Amen. But what's Vlisses my base aduersary? Ther. A dam'd pollitician, Scilla and Charibdis swallow him. Aia. And greedily deuoure him. Ther. And vtterly consume him. Aia. And eate vp his posterity. Ther. And rot out his memory: Aia. In endlesse infamy. Ther. And euerlasting obliquie. Both. Amen. Aia. Inough, no more: shall he the Armes inioy. And wee the shame? away Thersites, flye, Our prayers now sayd, we must prepare to dye. Ther. Dye, and with them be dam'd. Exit. Enter ouer the Stage all the Grecian Princes, courting and applauding Vlisses, not minding Aiax. Aia. Not looke on Aiax? Aiax Telamon, Hee that at once sau'd all your ships from fire, Not looke on me? ha? are these hands? this sword? Which made the fame of Troy great Hector shrinke Below the ruines of an abiect scorne? Sleighted? so sleighted? what base thing am I, To creepe to so dull Greeke, whom fame or blood Hath rair'd one step aboue? Ioue, see this; And laugh old Grand-sir: Ha, ha, ha, by hell I'le shake thy Kingdome for't: not looke on Aiax? The triple headed-dog, the whippes of Steele, The rauenous Vulture, and the restlesse stone Are all meere fables; heer's a trusty sword, 'Tis mine, mine owne, who claimes this from me? ha? Cowards and shallow witted fooles haue slept Amidst an armed troupe safe and secure Vnder this guard: nay Agamemnon too. But see, see from yon Sea, a shoale of sands Come rowling on, trick't vp in brisled sinnes Of Porposses and Dog-fish ho my sword, I will incounter them, they come from Greece, And bring a poysonous breath from Ithaca Temper'd with false Vlisses gall, foh, foh; It stinks of's wifes chast vrinall, looke, looke By yonder wood, how sliely in the skirts March policy and the diuell, on, I feare you not: Dare you not yet? not one to fight with mee: Who then? what's hee must cope with Aiax? Echo. Aiax? Aia. Well sayd old boy, wa'st Nestor my braue Lad? I'le doot, I'le doot, come my fine cutting blade, Make mee immortall: liuely fountaine sprout, Sprout out, yet with more life, braue glorious streame Growe to a Tyde, and sinke the Grecian fleete In seas of Aiax blood: so ho, so ho. Lure backe my soule againe, which in amaze Gropes for a perch to rest on: Heart, great heart Swell bigger yet and split, know gods, know men, Furies, inraged Spirits, Tortures all, Aiax by none could but by Aiax fall. He kills himselfe. Enter on the one part Agamemnon, Vlisses, Menelaus, Diomed, with the body of Hector borne by Grecian souldiers: On the other part, Priam, Paris, Deiphebus, Æneas, Anthenor, with the body of Achilles borne by Troian souldiers, they interchange them, and so with traling the Colours on both sides depart, Thersites onely stayes behinde and concludes. The Epilogue. Ther. A sweete exchange of Treasure, term't I may. Euen earth for ashes, and meere dust for clay: Let Aiax kill himselfe, and say 'twas braue Hector, a worthy Call, yet could not saue Poore foole his Coxcombe: Achilles beare him hye, And Troilus boldly, all these braue ones dye. Ha, ha, iudge you; Is it not better farre To keepe our selues in breath, and linger warre: Had all these fought as I'ue done, such my care Hath beene on both sides, that presume I dare, These had with thousands more suruiu'd: Iudge th'hoast, I shed no blood, no blood at all haue lost: They shall not see young Pirhus, nor the Queene Penthiselea, which had they but beene As wise as I, they might: nor Sinon, hee Famous of all men, to be most like mee. Nor after these, Orestes, and his mother Pillades Egistus with a many other Our second part doth promise: These if I fayle, As I on them; you on Thersites rayle. Explicit Actus Quintus.
