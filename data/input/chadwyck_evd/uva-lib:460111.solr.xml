      <field name="fulltext">THE CARMELITE: A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Mrs. SIDDONS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE By the AUTHOR. Spoken by Mr. PALMER. Old Drury's dock prepares a launch this night, New from the keel, (fair speed The Carmelite!) True British-built, and from the Tragic slip; She mounts great gunsâtho' not a first-rate ship: A gallant Knight commands, of ancient fame And Norman blood, Saint Valori his name; On his main-top the Christian Cross be bears, From Holy Land be comes, and Pagan wars: Twenty long years his lady mourns him dead, And bathes with faithful tears a widow'd bed; Our scene presents him ship-wreck'd on her coastâ No sign, we hope, our venture will be lost. Yet bold the Bard, to mount ambition's wave, And launch his wit upon a watery grave; Sharp critic rocks beneath him lie in wait, And envious quicksands bar the Muse's straight; Wild o'er his head Detraction's billows break, Doubt chills his heart, and terror pales his cheek: Hungry and faint, what cordials can he bring From the cold nymph of the Pierian spring? What stores collect from bare Parnassus' head, Where blooms no vineyard, where no beeves are fed? And great Apollo's laurels, which impart Fame to his head, are famine to his heart.â Yet on he toils, and eager bends his eyes, Where Fame's bright temple glitters to the skies. Ah, Sirs, 'tis easy work, to fit on shore And tutor him who tugs the labouring oar: Whilst he amidst the surging ocean steers, Now here, now there, as fashion's current veers: Rouse, rouse for his protection! you, who sit Rang'd in deep phalanx, arbiters of wit! And you aloft there, keep your beacon bright, Oh, make your Eddy-stone shew forth it's light; So shall our Bard steer to its friendly blaze, And anchor in the haven of your praise.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Time, that of the Representation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A rocky Shore, with a View of the Sea, at Break of Day. Fitz-Allan and Raymond meeting. Raymond. Well met, Fitz-Allan; what's the time of day? Fitz-Allan. Broad morning by the hour. Raymond. Sleeps the sun yet? Or has the stormy south, that howls so loud, Blown out his untrimm'd lamp, and left us here To be witch-ridden by this hag of night, Out of time's natural course? Fitz-Allan. Methinks the winds, Which peal'd like thunder thro' Glendarlock's towers, Have lower'd their note a pitch; the flecker'd clouds, Lifting their misty curtain in the east, Unmask the weeping day. Enter Montgomeri hastily. Montgomeri. Oh, are you men? Have you less mercy than the winds and waves, That you stand here aloof? Fitz-Allan. Why, what has chanc'd? Montgomeri. A noble vessel breaks upon the rocks, That jut from old Dunnose's rugged base; And as the floating fragments drive ashore Our plund'ring islanders (convert their hearts, Holy St. Michael!) dash the drowning wretches From the poor wreck they cling to, and engulph them Quick in the boiling waves: by Heav'n that made me I cou'd forswear my nature, when I see Man so degenerate! Raymond. Lo! we are ready; Lead to the beach. Montgomeri. Alas! 'tis now too late: I had not left it but that all was lost: The element had mercy, man had none. Two I have sav'd; the one a Carmelite, Noble the other in his mien and habit; I left them in the outskirts of the grove; Let us go forth, my friends, and bring them in: You to that quarter, I to this.âAway! [Exeunt severally. Enter Lord Hildebrand and Saint Valori. Saint Valori. Bear up, Lord Hildebrand! there's hope in view. See'st thou yon turrets, that o'ertop the wood? There we may shelter from the storm, and men More merciless than rocks and winds, that wreck'd Our strong-ribb'd galley in the foaming surge. Hildebrand. I see the towers you point at, but I fear My limbs will fail their burden ere we reach them. Let me lie down beneath these oaks, and die. Saint Valori. If thus you shake with the soul's ague, fear, Back to the sea, and seek the death you fled from; Make not a coward's grave on English ground; Your life is stak'd, your gauntlet is exchang'd, Each drop of blood about you is in pledge To meet the champion of Saint Valori, A lady's champion, in King Henry's lists: There fight; or, if you needs must die, die there, Fall, as a Norman knight shou'd fall, in arms. Hildebrand. Father, your words accord not with your weeds. Saint Valori. Our ancestors were holy men, and they Ordain'd the combat, as the test of truth; Let them who made the law defend the law, Our part is to obey it.âHark! who comes? The islanders will be upon us.âStand! Enter Fitz-Allan and Raymond. Fitz-Allan. What ho! Montgomeri!âthe men are found. Saint Valori. Inhuman Englishmen! Will you destroy Your brethren? We are Normans.â Enter Montgomeri. Montgomeri. Ye are men, Let that suffice; we are no savages. Saint Valori. 'Tis the brave youth who sav'd us. Montgomeri. Heav'n hath sav'd you, To Heav'n give thanks, O men redeem'd from death: All else have perish'd!â'Tis a barbarous coast. Saint Valori. How is your island named? Montgomeri. The Isle of Wight. Saint Valori. Alas! that isle so fair should prove so fatal!â And you our benefactor, by what name Shall we record you in our prayers? Montgomeri. I am call'd Montgomeri. Saint Valori. 'Twill be our grateful office, Generous Montgomeri, to make suit to Heaven To bless, reward, and from distress like ours Protect you ever. Montgomeri. Now declare thyself, And this thy mournful friend, whom grief makes dumb, Say who he is. Hildebrand. A wretch without a name. Saint Valori. A gentleman of Normandy he is, One who has seen good days.â'Tis now no time To tell you further: he has wounds about him, And bruises dealt him on the craggy beach, That cry for charity.âWhose is that castle? Montgomeri. A lady's, whom we serve, of Norman birth. Saint Valori. Then lead us to her gates, for we are Normans; Poor helpless men, fainting with want of food And over-watching: tedious nights and days We struggled with the storm: the greedy deep Has swallow'd up our ship, our friends, our all, And left us to your mercy. Sure your lady, Who owns so fair a mansion, owns withal A heart to give us welcome.âYou are silent. Fitz-Allan. To save you, and supply your pressing wants With food and raiment, and what else you need, We promise, nothing doubting: more than this Stands not within our privilegeâno stranger Enters her castle. Saint Valori. Wherefore this exclusion? What can she fear from us? Fitz-Allan. Ask not a reason; We question not her orders, but obey them. Saint Valori. Then lay us down before her castle-gates, And let us die: inhospitable gates! Your roofs shall echo with our famish'd shrieks.â A Norman she! impossible: our wolves Have hearts more pityful. Montgomeri. Your saints in bliss, Your calendar of martyrs does not own A soul more pure, a virtue more sublime: Her very name will strike defamers dumb. Saint Valori. Speak it. Montgomeri. Saint Valori. Saint Valori. Uphold me, Heaven! The ways of Providence are full of wonder, And all its works are mercy.âHow now, Sir! Will you betray yourself? what shakes you thus? Hildebrand. I sicken at the heart: let me go hence, And make myself a grave. Saint Valori. Be patient: stay!â And hath your lady here consum'd her youth In pensive solitude? Twenty long years, And still a widow! Montgomeri. Still a mournful widow. Saint Valori. Hath she such sorrows of her own, and yet No heart to pity our's? It cannot be: I'll not believe but she will take us in, And comfort her poor countrymen. Montgomeri. Forbid it, Heav'n, That misery thus should plead, and no friend found To speak in its behalf!âI'll move her for you. Saint Valori. The Mother of our Lord reward you for it! 'Twill be a Christian deed. Fitz-Allan. Montgomeri, turn: Have you your senses? the attempt is madness. Raymond. Where is the man, native or foreigner, (Inmates excepted) ever pass'd her doors?â Who dares to ask it? Montgomeri. I; Montgomeri. Raymond. So dare not I. Fitz-Allan. Nor I: success attend you! But share the attempt I dare notâso farewell. [Exeunt. Montgomeri. Farewell to both!âStrangers, be not dismay'd, I'll soon return; the place will be your safeguard. [Exit Montgomeri. Saint Valori. Lord Hildebrand, stand not aghast: you see The youth is confident: look up and live! Hildebrand. By my soul's penitence, I'd rather die Unpitied, starv'd, and to her castle dogs Bequeath my untomb'd carcase, than receive Life from her hands; the widow of Saint Valori! That brave heroic Champion of the Cross, Whom, from the holy wars returning home, Within the rugged PyrenÃ¦an passâ Saint Valori. No more of that: I have your full confession; You slew Saint Valori, and now his widow Provokes you by her champion to defend The rights you seiz'd, the title you inherit, And hold by bloody charter.âWhat's your fear? Saint Valori's dead; he cannot rise again, And beard you in the hists. Hildebrand. Oh, that he cou'd! So I were not a murderer. Saint Valori. Grant you slew him, Twenty long years have staunch'd the bleeding wound Of him you slew, and laid his angry ghost. Have you not rear'd his stately tomb, endow'd The abbey of Saint Valori, and purchas'd Perpetual masses to reclaim his soul Prom purgatory's bondage? Have you faith In absolution's power, and do you doubt If yet atonement's made? Hildebrand. I do perceive The hand of Heav'n hangs o'er me and my house: Why am I childless else? seven sons swept off To their untimely graves; their wretched mother By her own hand in raging phrenzy died; And last behold me here, forlorn, abandon'd, At life's last hour, before her surly gate, Deaf to my hungry cries: and shall we rank Such judgments in the casual course of things? To me 'tis palpable that heav'nly justice Puts nature by, and to the swelling sum Of my uncancell'd crimes adds all the lives Of them who sunk this morning. Saint Valori. What know'st thou, Blind or obdurate man? Shall we despond, On whom the light of this deliverance shines? No, let us boldly follow: there's a voice Augurs within me wond'rous things, and new, Now on the moment's point: for of a certain I know this lady shall set wide her gates To give us joyful welcome: sable weeds Shall turn to bridal robes, and joy shall ring Thro' all her festive mansion, where of late Deep groans and doleful lamentations howl'd. Therefore no more; from my prophetic lips Receive Heaven's mandateâand behold 'tis here! Enter Montgomeri. Montgomeri. Health to your hopes, that were but now so sick! Ye sons of sadness, cast off your despair; Heav'n has vouchsaf'd deliverance, and sends Its angel messenger in person to you. Saint Valori. Then let me kneel, and hail the heav'nly vision! [Kneels. Enter the Lady of Saint Valori. To Him, to Him alone, who by the hand Leads his unseeing creatures thro' the vale Of sorrow, to the day-spring of their hope, Be praise and adoration!âA poor Monk, (rising) Who has trode many a weary league, as far As there was Christian ground to carry him, Asks for himself, and for this mournful man, Newly escap'd from shipwreck, food and rest, Warmth, and the shelter of your peaceful roof. Matilda. Are ye of Normandy? Saint Valori. We are of Normandy: But were we not your countrymen, distress Like our's wou'd make us so. Two of your servants Spoke harshly, and had thrust us from your gates But for this charitable youth. Matilda. Alas! I am a helpless solitary woman, A widow, who have lostâO God! O God! 'Twill turn my brain to speak of what I've lost: It is amongst the lightest of my griefs That I have lost myself. Saint Valori. Thyself! Matilda. My senses: At best they are but half my own, sometimes I am bereft of all. Therefore I lead On this lone coast a melancholy life, And shut my gate, but not my charity, Against the stranger. Saint Valori. Oh, support me, Heaven! 'Tis she, 'tis she! that woe-tun'd voice is her's; Those eyes, that cast their pale and waining fires With such a melting languor thro' my soul, Those eyes are her's and sorrow's,âHeart, be still! She speaks again. Matilda. You shall have food and cloathing; I'll bring you medicines for your bruised wounds. What else you need declare. Saint Valori. If I speak now, She cannot bear it, it will turn her brain. What shall I say?âWe are your countrymenâ Oh my full heart! Oh anguish to dissemble! Matilda. Nay, if you weepâ Saint Valori. Let us but touch your altar: We are the sole sad relicks of the wreck. Let us but kneel and offer up one prayer For our soul's peace, then turn us forth to die. Matilda. Mercy forbid it!âOh, approach and enter. If you can weep, we will converse whole days, And speak no other language; we will sit, Like fountain statues, face to face oppos'd, And each to other tell our griefs in tears, Yet neither utter word.âPray you, pass on; I had not been thus strict, but that I hear Lord Hildebrand is on the seas: I hope You are not of his friends. Hildebrand. Death to my heart! O father Carmelite, I must have leaveâ Saint Valori. On your salvation, peace! Matilda. What wou'd he say? Saint Valori. His brain begins to turn: take him away. I pray you, lead him hence. Montgomeri leads off Hildebrand. Matilda. Alas! I pity him. Why dost thou stay behind?âWhence that emotion? What wou'dst thou more? Saint Valori. I wou'd invoke a blessing, But that each sainted spirit in the skies Will be thy better advocate. Matilda. Remember, When you converse with Heav'n, there is a wretch Who will be glad of any good man's prayers.â Farewell. Saint Valori. Oh, tell me, have you then endur'd Twenty long years of mournful widowhood? Matilda. They say 'tis twenty years ago he died; I cannot speak of time: it may be so; Yet I shou'd think 'twas yesterday. Saint Valori. I saw youâ Matilda. You saw me! When? Saint Valori. When you did wed your Lord.â The paragon of all this world you was. Grief has gone o'er you like a wintry cloud.â You've heard this voice before. Matilda. I think I have: It gives a painful sense of former days: I've heard such voices in my dreams; sometimes Convers'd with them all night; but then they told me My senses wander'd.âPray you, do not harm me: Leave me, good Monk; indeed I know you not. Saint Valori. I wore no monkish cowl in that gay hour When you wore bridal white. On Pagan ground, Beneath the banner of the Christian Cross, Faithful I fought; I was God's soldier then, Tho' now his peaceful servant. Matilda. You have fought Under the Christian Cross!âYou shake my brain. Saint Valori. Peace to your thoughts! I will no farther move you: Shall I not lead you hence? Matilda. Stand off; stand off! The murderer of Saint Valori is abroad; The bloody Hildebrand is on the seas.â Rise, rise, ye waves! blow from all points, ye winds, And whelm th'accursed plank that wafts him over In fathomless perdition!âLet him sink, He and his hateful crew! let none escape, Not one; or if one, let him only breathe To tell his tale, and die!âAway! begone! You've made me mad. Saint Valori. I was Saint Valori's friend: He never yet bled with the battle's wound, But I shed drop for drop: when o'er the sands Of sultry Palestine with panting heart He march'd, my panting heart with his kept time, And number'd throb for throb. Matilda. Where are my people? What ho! Montgomeri! Lead, lead me hence. Enter Montgomeri hastily, with Gyfford. Give me thine arm; support me! Oh, 'tis well. To horse, to horse!âI have a champion now, Whose hand, heart, soul are mine, and mine are his; One who has valour to assert my cause, And worth to wear the honours he defends. Montgomeri. What hast thou done, old man? Gyfford. Stay not to question; Look to the lady: leave the Monk with me. Matilda. Come, let us hence; I do not live without thee. [Exit with Montgomeri. Saint Valori. Amazement!âSpeak, what kindred, what affection, What passion binds her to that youth?âResolve me, Who and what is he? Gyfford. You are curious, father. Who he may be I know not; what he was I well remember. Saint Valori. What was he? Gyfford. Her page; A menial thing, no better than myself. Saint Valori. Heavens! can it be? Will she so far descend From her great name, to wanton with her page? Saw you the look she gave him? Gyfford. I did see it. Saint Valori. It seem'd as tho' his eyes had magic in them, That charm'd away her madness.âHah! you sigh: What means that pensive movement of your head? Answer! Gyfford. Good father, question me no more. Fortune can level all things in this world, Pull down the mighty and exalt the mean: But you and I methinks have outliv'd wonders.â Now to the castle! Shut both ears and eyes: Hear without noting; see, but not observe. End of the first Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An Apartment in Matilda's Castle. Enter Saint Valori and Gyfford. Gyfford. With awful wonder I survey and hear you, Whilst thro' the veil of that disguiseful habit, Thro' all the changes time and toil have wrought In that once-noble visage, I scarce trace The lineaments of my most honour'd Lord. Saint Valori. Awake from this surprize, and hear me, Gyfford. I am no spectre, but thy living master: Wounded and breathless on the ground I lay, Welt'ring in blood: th'assassins fled and left me; There I had soon expir'd, but that a company Of merchants journeying from Venice found me, And charitably staunch'd my bleeding wounds. To their own homes they bore me: heal'd, restor'd, In a Venetian galley I embark'd, And sail'd for Genoa; but ere we reach'd Our destin'd port, a Saracen assail'd And master'd our weak crew.âTo tell the tale Of my captivity, escape, return, Would ask more leisure, and a mind at ease. Gyfford. But why does brave Saint Valori appear A bearded Carmelite? Saint Valori. This holy habit Thro' a long course of dangerous pilgrimage Has been my saving passport: thus attir'd I reach'd my native castle, found it lorded By the usurper Hildebrand; with zeal I burn'd to call my faithful people round me, And throw off my disguise; this I had done, But strait arriv'd a herald from King Henry To warn him to the lists against the champion Of my supposed widow: the pale coward Shrunk, yet obey'd the summons. The thought struck me To join his train, and in my sovereign's presence At the last trumpet's signal to come forth Before the King, the lords, and armed knights, And strike confusion to the caitiff's soul.â The rest needs no relation. Gyfford. 'Tis resolv'd To morrow for Southampton we depart; There Henry keeps his court. Saint Valori. Why then, to-morrow Truth and the morning-sun shall rise together, And this black night of doubt shall be dispell'd: Till then lock fast my secret in thy heart, And know me for none other than I seem. Lo, where they come! Yet, yet I will be patient; Time will bring all things forth.âGyfford, withdraw. [Exeunt. Enter Matilda and Montgomeri. Matilda. I think he said he was my husband's friend; If so I've been too harsh: reason forsook me, For he did speak of things that rent my heart: But let that pass.âDost thou observe, Montgomeri? Montgomeri. With fix'd attention and devoted heart I hear, and note your pleasure. Matilda. I am calm, Thou seest I am, and not about to speak, As sometimes, when my thoughts obey no order: Therefore I pray thee mark.âThou must have noted With what a tenderness I've train'd thee up From helpless infancy to blooming manhood: Hast thou not noted this? Montgomeri. I were most vile Did I forget it. Matilda. I am sure thou dost not; For from the moment of thy birth till now I've nurs'd thy opening virtues, mark'd their growth, And gloried in the fruit of my adoption: I've register'd each movement of thy soul, And find it tun'd to honour's loftiest pitch, To soft affection modell'd, and to love, The harmony of nature: my best hopes Are satisfied, and thou art all I pray'd for. Montgomeri. What thou hast made me that I truly am, And will be ever: hands, head, heart are your's. Matilda. The day is coming on, the wish'd-for day (After a night of twice ten tedious years) At length is coming on: justice is granted; I go to Henry's court; Lord Hildebrand Is summon'd to the lists: and where's the man To avenge the widow's cause? Montgomeri. Where is the man! And can you want a champion?âHave I liv'd The creature of your care, the orphan child Of your adopting charity, the thing Your plastic bounty fashion'd from the dust Of abject misery; and does my heart Utter one drop of blood that is not your's, One artery that does not beat for you? Matilda. Know, then, I have a champion, noble, brave, Heir of the great Saint Valori, my son. Montgomeri. What do I hear? thy son!âWhere has he liv'd, That I have never seen him? never known There was a living hero of the name? Oh, tell me where he is, that I may fly To do him faithful service, on my knee Brace on his glittering armour, bear his shield, The glorious badge of his nobility, And shout with triumph when his conqu'ring sword Cleaves the assassin's crest.âOh send me hence, To hail his victory, or share his fall! Matilda. Thou art my son. Montgomeri. Merciful God! thy son! Matilda. Thou art my son; for thee alone I've liv'd, For thee I have surviv'd a murder'd husband; For theeâbut it would break thy filial heart To hear what I have suffer'd; madness seiz'd me, And many a time (sweet Jesus intercede, For I was not myself!) yes, many a time In my soul's anguish, with my desperate hand Rais'd for the stroke of death, a thought, a glance Of thee, my child, has smote my shatter'd brain, And stopt th'impending blow. Montgomeri. Oh, spare thyself, Spare me the dread description! Matilda. Thou hast been Thy mother's guardian angel: furious once, In the mind's fever, to Glendarlock's roof Mad'ning I rush'd; there, from the giddy edge Of the projecting battlements, below, Measuring the fearful leap, I cast my eye: Thy cherub form arrested it; my child Upon the pavement underneath my feet Sported with infant playfulness; my blood Drove back upon my heart; suspended, pois'd, High hung in air, with outstretch'd arms I stood, Pondering the dreadful deed; thy fate prevail'd, Nature flew up, and push'd me from the brinkâ I shrunk, recoil'd, and started into reason. Montgomeri. Oh terrible to thought! Oh pictur'd horror! It pierces to my brain; there's madness in it. Matilda. Yes, sorrow had o'erturn'd thy mother's brain: I have been mad, my son; and oftentimes I find, alas! all is not yet compos'd, Sound, and at peace: it takes a world of time To heal the wounds of reason; even now, When I would fain relate my life's sad story, I cannot range my scatter'd thoughts in order To tell it as I shou'd.âI pray thee pardon me; I'll do my best to recollect myself, If thou'lt be patient. Montgomeri. Patient! Oh, thou sufferer! Oh, thou maternal softness! hear thy son, Thus kneeling, bathing with his tears thy feet, Swear to cast off each fond alluring thought, The world, its honours, pleasures, and ambition; Here in this solitude to live with thee, To thee alone devoted! Matilda. No, my son: Tho' in this solitude I have conceal'd thee, Ev'n from thyself conceal'd thee, to evade A fell usurper's search, and stemm'd the tide Of nature, gushing to a mother's heart; Still I have done it in the sacred hope Of some auspicious hour, when I might shew thee Bright as thy father's fame. Montgomeri. I own the cause, And know how watchfully this hungry vulture Has hover'd o'er thee on his felon wings. Now I can solve this solitude around us, Why thou hast built thine airey in this cragg, And with a mother's care conceal'd thy young. Matilda. Another day, and thenâmeanwhile be secret; Discovery now wou'd but disturb the house From its sobriety, and mar the time Of awful preparation.âPass to-morrow!â (Oh, all ye saints and angels, make it happy!) Then, if thou com'st a living conqueror home, This roof, that still has echoed to my groans, Shall ring with triumphs to Saint Valori's name: But ifâ Montgomeri. Avert the sad, ill-omen'd word! Thou shalt not name it: my great father's spirit Swells in my bosom.âWhen my falchion gleams, When the red Cross darts terror from my shield, The coward's heart shall quail, and Heaven's own arm, Ere mine can strike, shall lay the murderer low. Matilda. Thy father stirs within thee: hark! methinks I hear the shrieks of his unburied ghost, Screaming for vengeance.âOh, support, defend me! See where he gleams, he bursts upon my sight! 'Tis he! 'tis he! I clasp him to my heart; My hero! my Saint Valori! my husband! [Embraces him. Enter Gyfford unseen; starts. Gyfford. Husband! oh fatal word! undone for ever! Matilda. I will array thee in a sacred suit, The very armour my Saint Valori wore, When in the single combat he unhors'd And slew the Lord Fitz-Osborn. On that helm High-plum'd victory again shall stand, And clap her wings exulting; from that shield Vengeance with gorgon terrors shall look forth, Awfully frowning.âHah! what man art thou? [Discovering Gyfford. Gyfford, what would'st thou? wherefore this intrusion? Gyfford. A noble messenger from Henry's court Is landed on the isle. Matilda. From the King, say'st thou? Gyfford. A runner of his train, whose utmost speed Scarce distanc'd him an hour, is now arriv'd, And gives this warning. Matilda. Did you not enquire His master's name and title? Gyfford. Lord De Courci. Matilda. A generous and right noble lord he is: Our Normandy boasts not a worthier baron, Nor one affianc'd to our house more kindly: Prepare to give him welcome.âFollow me. [Exit with Montgomeri. Gyfford. Yes, to destruction, for that way thou lead'st. Husband!âher husband! her Saint Valori! It cannot be.âWithout the church's rites Wed him she could not; to conceal those rites, And wed by stealth, is here impossible. What must I think?âThat he is yet her husband In meditation only, not in form. Embracing too!âOh mortal stab to honour! O shame, shame, shame! that I shou'd live to see it. Enter Saint Valori hastily. Saint Valori. What hast thou seen? My mind is on the rack; Thou'st been in conference with thy lady; speak!â If thou hast ought discover'd that affects My honour, tell it. Gyfford. Hard task you enjoin; Wou'd rather I were in my grave, than living To utter what I've seen. Saint Valori. Nay, no evasion. Gyfford. For the world's worth I would not with my knowledge Add or diminish of the truth one tittle. Saint Valori. Gyfford, as thou shalt render up the truth To the great Judge of hearts, say what thou know'st Of my unhappy wife; nor more nor less, Give me the proof unvarnish'd. Gyfford. I surpriz'd Her and Montgomeri heart to heart embracingâ Saint Valori. Death! Heart to heart embracing!âWoman, woman! Gyfford. Fond and entranc'd within his arms she lay; Then with uplifted rapturous eyes exclaim'd, âMy hero! my Saint Valori! my husband!â Saint Valori. Husband! reflect.âArt sure she call'd him husband! Gyfford. If there be faith in man, I've spoke the truth. Saint Valori. Why then the truth is out, and all is past: I have no more to ask. Gyfford. Hear me with favour; I'll not abuse the licence of old age And faithful service with too many words. Saint Valori. What canst thou tell me?âI have one within That is my monitor: not unprepar'd I meet this fatal stroke, nor with revilings Or impious curses (be my witness, Gyfford!) Do I profane Heav'n's ear, tho' hard and painful This bitter visitation of its wrath. Gyfford. Tho' to the sure conviction of my senses I saw and heard what I have now reported, Yet, circumstances weigh'd, I must believe As yet she is not wedded. Saint Valori. Hah! not wedded? Perish the man who dares to breathe a doubt Of her unspotted chastity: not wedded! Yet heart to heart embracing! dreadful thought!â Death in his direst shape approach me rather Than that dishonest doubt! Gyfford. Wou'd I had died Ere I had seen this day! Saint Valori. Wretch that I am, Why was I snatch'd from slaughter? why deliver'd From barbarous infidels? why, when o'erwhelm'd And sinking in th'oblivious deep, preserv'd, Wash'd like a floating fragment to the shore, Sav'd, nourish'd, ransom'd by the very hand That cuts my heart asunder; set in view Of all my soul held dear; and now, ev'n now, As I reach forth my hand to seize the goal, The resting-place and haven of my hope, Dash'd in a moment back, and lost for ever? Gyfford. Such is the will of Heaven! For me, thus old, And blighted with misfortune, I've no strength, No root to bear against this second storm; There, where I fall, I'll make myself a grave. Saint Valori. No more of this: you've heard my last complaint; For I must soon put off these monkish weeds, And what a consecrated knight should do, Fitting the Cross he wears, that must be done.â How stands your preparation for to-morrow? Will she depart? Gyfford. I think she will; for now The Lord De Courci, from King Henry sent, Bears courtly salutation to your Lady, With formal summons to her challenger. Saint Valori. If it be that De Courci who was once My youth's companion, and my bosom friend, A more accomplished knight ne'er carried arms: His coming is most timely.âTell me, Gyfford, Rememberest thou the armour which I wore When in the lists I combated Fitz-Osborn?â I gave it to my wife. Gyfford. I well remember. Saint Valori. And hath she kept it, think'st thou? Gyfford. She hath kept it. Saint Valori. 'Tis well; for that's the suit, the very suit, Which I must wear to-morrow. Gyfford. Ah, my Lord! She hath bestow'd that armour on her champion; And young Montgomeri with to-morrow's dawn Starts, like another Phaeton, array'd In substituted splendor: on his arm He bears the shield of great Saint Valori, A golden branch of palm, with this device, âAnother, and the same!ââ'Twill be a pageant Glittering as vanity and love can make it. Saint Valori. Mournful as death.âMy armour will she take? My shield, my banners, to array her champion? Let them beware how they divide the spoil Before the lion's kill'd.âOh, fall of virtue! Oh, all ye matron powers of modesty! How time's revolving wheel wears down the edge Of sharp affliction! Widows sable weeds Soon turn to grey; drop a few tears upon them, And dusky grey is blanch'd to bridal white; Then comes the sun, shines thro' the drizzling show'r, And the gay rainbow glows in all its colours. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. An Apartment in the Castle. Enter Lord Hildebrand and Saint Valori. Hildebrand. Ah, father Carmelite! where hast thou been? Was it well done to leave thy wretched friend To be devour'd by heart-consuming anguish? Saint Valori. I left you to repose. Hildebrand. I know it not: Sleep is my horror; then the furies rise; Then pale Saint Valori appears before me: Trembling I wake, cold damps bedew my limbs, And my couch floats with tears.âIs this repose? Saint Valori. No; yet it moves my wonder why your conscience, Mute for so many years, shou'd on the sudden Break into voice, and cry so loud against you.â I found you lull'd in a luxurious calm, Feasting upon the spoils of him you stabb'd; Your castle flow'd with revelry and wine, And you the loudest of the sons of riot: Where was your conscience then? Hildebrand. With you it came; You are the father of my soul's repentance: Your fascinating eye pervades my breast; Conscious, abash'd, uncover'd to the heart, I stand before youâto your ear confide Things unreveal'd to man. Now, as I see you, Tho' in religion's peaceful garment cloath'd, Saint Valori methinks appears before me, Dreadful in arms, and braves me to the lists. Saint Valori. Take food and rest, recruit your body's strength, And you'll forget these fears. Hildebrand. I'll die with famine Before I'll eat the charitable bread Of her I made a widow; and for sleep, I tell thee once again sleep is my horror. Methought but now by shipwreck I was plung'd Into the foaming ocean; on the shore Your figure stood with beck'ning hand outstretch'd To snatch me from the waves; chear'd with the sight, Thro' the white surf I struggled; with strong arm You rais'd me from the gulph; joyful I ran T'embrace my kind preserverâwhen at once Off fell your habit, bright in arms you stood, And with a voice of thunder cried aloud, âVillain, avaunt! I am Saint Valori!ââ Then push'd me from the cliff: down, down I fell, Fathoms on fathoms deep, and sunk for ever! Saint Valori. This was your dream. Hildebrand. Now hear my waking terrors.â Rous'd by this dream I started; to the wall Furious I rush'd, to dash my desperate brains: Burst with the force, a secret door flew open, Where full in view a lighted altar blaz'd With holy tapers bright; around it hung The funeral trophies of Saint Valori; Red gleam'd the banner of the bloody Cross, And on a tablet underneath was written, âPray for the peace of his departed soul!â Upon my knees I dropt, and would have pray'd, When soon, behold! the Lady Widow enter'd, Led by the generous youth who sav'd our lives: I rose, made low obeisance, and retir'd. Saint Valori. You left them there.âDid all this pass in silence? Hildebrand. All; not a word was spoken. Saint Valori. Did you note Her look, her action?âHow did she dismiss you? Abruptly, eagerly? Hildebrand, With matron grace, Her hand thus gently waving, she dismiss'd me; The other hand most lovingly was lock'd In his on whom she lean'd. Saint Valori, No more of this. Hark! you are summon'dârouse from this despair; Shake off your lethargy! [Trumpet. Hildebrand. What trumpet's that? Saint Valori. To you, or to your challenger, the last; Death sounds the knell, and justice seals the doom. Hildebrand. My soul sinks down abash'd: I cannot fight; What wou'd you more? I have confest the murder. Saint Valori. You have confest you know not what: retire! Go to your chamber; I will quickly follow, And bring you comfort.âNay, make no reply. The time is labouring, wond'rous things and new Press to the birth; prepare yourself to meet them. [Exeunt severally. Enter Matilda and her Domesticks, De Courci and his Train. Matilda. My noble Lord, thrice welcome! you are come To glad the mourner's heart, and with your presence Make her poor cottage rich. De Courci. Most noble Lady, Henry of Normandy, the kingly heir Of England's mighty conqueror, of his grace And princely courtesy, by me his servant, As a most loving father, kindly greets you Which salutation past, I am to move you Upon the matter of your suit afresh, Its weight and circumstance; how many years It hath been let to sleep; what forfeiture And high default you stand in, shou'd it fail: Conjuring you, as fits a Christian king, By the lov'd memory of your honour'd Lord Who now hath tenanted the silent grave These twenty years and more, not to proceed In this high matter on surmise, or charge Of doubtful circumstance; the crime alledg'd Being so heinous, the appeal so bloody, And he whom you attaint so brave and noble. Matilda. I know, my Lord, in property the law Can plead prescription and the time's delay; But justice, in an inquisition made for blood, With retrospective eye thro' ages past Moves her own pace, nor hears the law's demur.â Why I have let this murder sleep thus long, Necessity, and not my will, must answer. The conqueror William, and his furious son, With iron hand upheld th'oppressor's power, And stopt their ears against the widow's cries. In painful silence brooding o'er my grief, On this lone rock, upon the ocean's brink, Year after year I languish'd, in my dreams Conversing oft with shadowy shapes and horrors, That scar'd me into madness.âOh, my Lord! Bear with my weakness: pray regard me not; I have a remedy at handâmy tears. [weeps. De Courci. Sad relict of the bravest, best of men, Tell not thy griefs to me, nor let my words (Which by commission, not of choice, I speak) Shake thy firm purpose; for on England's throne No tyrant sits, deaf to the widow's cause, But Heav'n's vicegerent, merciful and just. If stedfast thou art fix'd in thy appeal, Stedfast in justice is thy sovereign too. Bring forth thy knight appellant, for the lists Expect him, and may Heav'n defend the right! Matilda. Thanks to thy royal sender! on my knee I offer prayers to Heaven for length of days, And blessings shower'd on his anointed head.â Now, gallant Lord, you shall behold my champion, My shepherd boy, who, like the son of Jeffe, Unskill'd in arms, must combat this Philistine.â Montgomeri, come forth! Enter Montgomeri. De Courci. Is this your knight? Matilda. This is my knight. I trust not in the strength Of mortal man; Heav'n will uphold my cause, And to a murderer's heart will guide the blow, Tho' from an infant's hand. De Courci. Of what degree Must I report him? In the royal lists, Against so proud a name as Hildebrand, The warlike forms of knighthood will demand That noble shall to noble be oppos'd. Matilda. Not unprepar'd I shall attend the lists, And at my sovereign's feet prefer the proofs Which honour's forms demand. De Courci. You know the peril, If you fall short. Matilda. I take it on my head. De Courci. Where have you serv'd? What battles have you seen? Montgomeri. Few and unfortunate have been the fields, Where I have fought.âI serv'd a sinking cause; Robert of Normandy was my liege Lord, For I am Norman born. De Courci. Have you been train'd In tournaments? Montgomeri. I never broke a lance, Nor shall I, as I hope, but in his heart Who stabb'd Saint Valori. De Courci. Noble Lady, I wou'd impart something of nearest import To your more private ear. Matilda. Let all withdraw: [they withdraw. Leave us.âAnd now, my Lord and honour'd guest, Impart your noble thoughts; for sure I am None others can be native of a soul, Where courtesy and valour are enshrin'd, As in a holy altar, under guard Of consecrated keepersâtherefore speak. De Courci. Let infamy fix on me, when I wrong A confidence so generous!âHeav'n bestow'd One friend, the pride and blessing of my life; Heav'n, when you lost a husband, from me also Took that one friend away, and in his grave Buried my heart beside him. Matilda. Yes, my Lord, We both have cause to mourn him: I remember The day he parted for the Holy Wars, His manly bosom struggling to repress Its bursting passion, in those racking moments, When stern religion rent him from my arms, Then, even then, in his capacious foul Friendship had partâyou shar'd it with Matilda. Need I proceed! ah, no! for you was present, You took him from me, on your neck he fell;â I parted, sunk, and never saw him more. De Courci. 'Twas in those parting moments he committed A sacred charge, the very test of friendship, Your soft unsheltered beauty, to my care. I serv'd, consol'd you, lov'd you as a brother; But soon Saint Valori call'd me from my charge, For war and sickness had consum'd our host, And Palestine was drench'd with Christian blood.â We fought, we conquer'd, and from Pagan hands Rescued the captive Cross: and now command My zealous heart, you are it's mistress still. Matilda. There needs not this, my Lord; for I can read Your zeal without a preface: freely then, As a friend shou'd, and plainly speak your thoughts. De Courci. When rumour of this combat reach'd my ears, Without delay I sent a trusty page, Offering myself as your devoted knight: He brought for answer, that you had a champion, You thank'd me for my offer;âcold repulse Temper'd in courteous phrase! still I submitted In silence, as became me, to your pleasure, Musing who this might beâ Matilda. And now you find him A stripling youth unknown, in arms a novice, And you condemn my choice; these are your thoughts. De Courci. I do confess it.âOh, reflect in time! Think not, because nature hath cast a form In fair proportion, strung his youthful joints With nerves that bear him bounding to the chace, Or hurl the wrestler in the shouting ring, That you have train'd a champion to encounter A combatant so practis'd in the lists, So valorous in fight as Hildebrand. Matilda. What I have done, I've done: your zeal, my Lord, May start new terrors for my hero's danger, Shake me with new alarms, but change it cannot. De Courci. Turn not away, but still with patience hear me. Think what you are, great in yourself, yet greater As brave Saint Valori's widow: Oh preserve That name untainted; hear what honour counsels; Truth makes me bold, your danger is my warrant. Matilda. You was my husband's friend; I own your plea. Lo! I am turn'd to hear: proceed. De Courci. I was his friend, I am your's also; and as such I warn you Against a deed so fatal, that the steel Of Hildebrand gave not a stab more mortal To life than this to fame. Matilda. My Lord, my Lord! You rise too fast upon me, and advance Too strongly on so weak a disputant, So much to seek for reason as I am. De Courci. May I not then demand, what is this boy, Whom you thus dignify? this page, this lacquey, The very topmost pitch of whose promotion Had been to touch the stirrup of Saint Valori? Matilda. What is he!âbut you question me too harshly; I'll answer to the King; but to a friend Who treats me with suspicion, I am silent. You bid me call to memory what I am: I hope, when thus you school me, you yourself In your own precepts need no monitor. I think I am as humble as I shou'd be Under such hard correction. I acknowledge Two powerful duties: to my husband one, The first and strongest; to yourself the next, As my much-honour'd guest; but I oppose The tyranny of friendship, which would stamp Dishonour on the worthy, and forbid My free affections to direct their choice Where nature warrants, and my soul approves. [Exit. De Courci alone. Why then there's no perfection in the sex, Or I had found it here. Farewell to grief; So much for tears! tho' twenty years they flow, They wear no channels in a widow's cheeks; And still the ambush'd smile lurks underneath The watery surface, ready to start up At the next lover's summons; now to greet A hero's passion, now to wed a page. Enter Saint Valori. Saint Valori. My Lord De Courci, doth your memory serve To recollect a certain pledge of love, A jewel, which the lady of this house Gave to her husband by your hands? De Courci. A bracelet; She took it from her arm when they did part: I well remember it. Saint Valori. Was it like this? De Courci. The very same; I gave it to Saint Valori When he embark'd for Palestine. Saint Valori. You did: I had it then; your memory is perfect. De Courci. You had it then!âWhat must I think of this? Saint Valori. Can you this little token keep in mind, And not remember him you gave it to? De Courci. Explain yourself; you speak in mysteries. Saint Valori. Be temperate then; let not your loud surprize Betray me to the house: I'm here unknown. De Courci. Impossible! tho' the dead rose again, Yet this can not be he. Saint Valori. My friend! my friend! Come to my arms! let this embrace convince you. De Courci. Oh earth and heaven! he lives. Saint Valori. He lives indeed To a new life of misery. Be still! Forbear to question me: another time Thou shalt hear all, but let this hour be sacred To friendship's pressing call.âMy wife! my wife! De Courci. Oh, my prophetic fears! Saint Valori. Unhappy woman! For why shou'd I accuse her? twenty years A mournful widow, and at last to start So wide from all propriety; and now, After so brave a struggle, now to sink Her honour, which still bore so proud a sail Thro' the rough tide of time: oh bitter thought! Oh aggravating shame! De Courci. Alas, my friend, How shall I comfort you? I see you point At young Montgomeri: in friendship's right I ask'd her private ear, and boldly urg'd The peril of her fame. Saint Valori. And what reply? De Courci. Patient at first she heard; but when I touch'd The master-string, and set to view how base The choice of such a minion, such a page, Thenâbut 'twere painful to describe the scene, Vain to conceal: she loves him to distraction. Saint Valori. Can it be doubted? She has married him. De Courci. Indeed! Saint Valori. I have a trusty servant here, Who saw her clasp him in her wanton arms, Twine, like pale ivy round the polish'd bark Of the smooth beech, whilst rapt'rous she exclaim'd, âMy hero! my Saint Valori! my husband!ââ Oh, she is lost, beyond redemption lost. De Courci. Who now shall dream of constancy in woman? What's to be done?âYour life dissolves the combat. Saint Valori. That shame I've sav'd her from: Lord Hildebrand Is dying in this house. De Courci. Lord Hildebrand! How many strange events are here combin'd Of sorrow and surprize! so thick they crowd, So swift they change, I know not where to turn, Nor what to counsel. Saint Valori. What can counsel give? Can words revoke, can wisdom reconcile, Th'indissoluble web which fate has wove? And shall I stay and harbour here with shame? Walk, like a discontented moping ghost, To haunt and hover round their nuptial bed, When I can die, as I have liv'd, in arms?â Off, holy counterfeit! begone, disguise! De Courci. Stop, I conjure you: rush not on despair. Saint Valori. Despair!âAnd have I worn the Cross so long But as the mask and mockery of religion? No, 'tis the armour of a Christian knight, And with this gauntlet I defy despair. De Courci. Then by that sacred symbol, by our friendship And faithful brotherhood in God's holy service, I do beseech thee to persist in hope: For whilst one circumstance of doubt remains, One, tho' the slightest fragment is afloat, That fond credulity ere clung to, still, Still will I keep some happy chance in view To save thy lady's honour. Saint Valori. Gallant friend, Thy counsel shall prevail, I will persist; And as misfortune is the world's best school For true philosophy, I will extract The cordial patience from the bitter root Of this implanted pain. Come, brave De Courci! Pleasure's gay scene, and hope's delusive dream, Are vanish'd, lost; love's fairy palace sinks In the false fleeting sand on which 'twas built; Whilst thy immortal constancy alone Stands in the waste, a solitary column, To tell life's mournful traveller where once Joy revell'd, and a stately fabric rose.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Enter Matilda and Lord Hildebrand. Matilda. Stop, stranger! wherefore have you left your chamber? Will you go forth with all your wounds about you? Return, nor rashly counteract our care, That labours to preserve you. Hildebrand. Shall I make Your house a grave? The wounds you see are nothing, Their pain may be assuag'd by drugs and ointments; Nature abounds in simples, that can heal These tumours of the body. Matilda. If the cure Be, as you say, so easy, why oppose it? Is pain your choice, that you resist our medicines, And thus expose your rankling wounds undrest To the raw fest'ring air? Hildebrand. Ah, generous lady! 'Tis but a superficial flattering art To heal the skin, and make the surface whole, When an unsearchable and mortal sting Has pierc'd the nobler part. Matilda. That sting is grief: You mourn a wise perhaps, or some dear friend, In your late shipwreck lost: if it be so, I'll not arraign your sorrow; yet remember, Tho' short of their allotted time they fell, 'Twas Heav'n that struck them short, they were not murder'd, As my Saint Valori, by vile treach'rous man. Hildebrand. Oh, horror! horror! Matilda. Have I touch'd the cause? Was there a friend? a wife? Hildebrand. Nor wife, nor friend: And yetâ Matilda. What yet? Your heart perhaps was fix'd Upon your freighted treasures, hoarded up By carking care, and a long life of thrift, Now without interest or redemption swallow'd By the devouring bankrupt waves for ever: What then? your cares have perish'd with your fortune. Hildebrand. The wreck of friends and fortune I bewail As things Heav'n gives and takes away at pleasure; Conditional enjoyments, transient loans, Bliss that accumulates a debt of pain: Swift their succession, sudden their reverse. To-day the setting sun descends in tears, To-morrow's dawn breaks forth, and all is joy: But guilt involves me in perpetual night; No morning star, no glimmering ray of hope; Eternal tossings on a bed of thorns, Conscience, that raven, knelling in my ear, And vulture furies plucking at my heart! Matilda. Then I conjectur'd right, and 'tis remorse Which tortures you; I read it in your eyes: Did that descending virtue come on earth, To set at large the captive or the free? 'Twas to redeem the captive: Turn to him, Turn then, and seek your saving hope, repentance; Go to your Carmelite, confess to him, Fly to your soul's physician for a cure; Whether with soft emollients he assuage, Or with corrosive penances consume The cank'rous gangrene that now gnaws your heart. Hildebrand. I have confess'd to him, he knows my guilt; But what can he, alas! there lives but one Under Heav'n's canopy, who can absolve.â Hither th'immediate hand of Heav'n has led me, Hopeless of pardon, to expire before you, And cast your husband's murderer at your feet. Matilda. Ah, Scorpion! is it thou? I shake with horror.â Thee have I pitied? thee have I preserv'd?â Monster, avaunt! Go to the rocks for food, Call to the winds for pity! lay thee down Beneath some blighted yew, whose pois'nous leaf Kills as it falls; there howl thyself to death!â Hangs the roof o'er us yet? I am astonish'd.â Art not asham'd, O earth, to bear him yet? O sea, to cast him up again?âBegone! Hildebrand. I do not wait for pardon, but for death: Call to your servants; whelm me with their swords.â Heav'n throws me on your mercy; you receiv'd And gave me shelter; hospitably tender'd Food and restoring med'cines; I refus'd them: My thirst is unallay'd, my wounds undrest, No particle of food has past my lips, For I disdain a fraud upon your pity; And, where I can't have pardon, scorn support. The only mercy I implore is death. Matilda. Mercy! and dare thy tongue pronounce the name?â Mercy! thou man of blood, thou hast destroy'd it, It came from heaven to save Saint Valori: You saw the cherub messenger alight From its descent; with outspread wings it sate, Covering his breast; you drew your cursed steel, And thro' the pleading angel pierc'd his heart. Then, then the moon, by whose pale light you struck Turn'd fiery red, and from her angry orb Darted contagious sickness on the earth; The planets in their courses shriek'd for horror; Heav'n dropt maternal tears.âOh! art thou come? Enter Montgomeri. Montgomeri. Why dost thou tremble? Why this ghastly terror? Matilda. Save me, support me! In thy arms I fall: I mov'd not till thou cam'st, lest I had sunk Upon the floor, and catching at the hand That stabb'd Saint Valori, his touch had kill'd me. Montgomeri. That stabb'd Saint Valori! Is this the wretch? Is Hildebrand before me?âDraw, thou traitor! Stand to defence, or die! Hildebrand. Behold my heart! Strike! I expect no mercy. Matilda. Stop thine hand: Black tho' he be, as infamy can make him, He is defenceless, wounded, and expiring. Hildebrand. Wilt thou not add, repentant?âI am vanquish'd, Body and soul laid prostrate by despair. I do confess my crime: what can I more? Castle, demesne, and treasure, all the spoils Of my accursed avarice, I resign: Take my life too; dismiss me from a world Where I have none to mourn me, no kind hand To close my eyes; of children, wife, and friends, (Save only this poor Carmelite) bereft; Be merciful to him, he is not guilty. If I dare ask a little earth to cover me For Christian decency, I wouldâbut that, That were too muchâmy tears will sink a grave. Montgomeri. He's deeply penitent: you'll not refuse What he petitions for: 'twere most unchristian To let him die without the church's rites. Matilda. Forbear! Montgomeri. He's dyingâsee, he faintsâhe falls. [Hildebrand sinks on the ground. 'Twill give him comfort in the hour of death; And that I'd give ev'n to a murderer. Matilda. You never knew your father, and in you Pity is natural; in me 'tis treason To breathe the air which his pollution taints; A crime to look upon his eyes and live. Montgomeri. I feel, I feel your cause; there let him fall: Die where he lists, but give his corpse a grave.â And see, the Carmelite approaches. Matilda. Hah! The Lord De Courci too!âStand by the body; And if the wretch has breath to speak again, Call them to witness his confession. Mark! In Heav'n's own presence, mark this awful scene, And write it on thy heart!âFarewell! Be constant! [Exit Matilda. Enter Saint Valori and De Courci. Montgomeri. Noble De Courci, and thou reverend father, From whom the penitent in life's last hour Draws holy comfort, look upon that wretch, Visit his soul with peace at its departure, And take confession from his dying lips. Saint Valori. Withdraw, and stand apart then out of hearing. [They withdraw. Lord Hildebrand, if thou hast sense and motion, Reach forth thine hand.âSo! If thou canst, look up! I am the Carmelite. Hildebrand. Oh, save me, save me! I am a sinful man. Saint Valori. But not a murderer: He who speaks to you is Saint Valori. Hildebrand. God of my hope! is it some blessed spirit, Or living man that speaks? Saint Valori. A living man, Saint Valori himself; no spirit.âMark! I grasp your hand in token of forgiveness: Dost thou perceive it? Hildebrand. At my heart I feel it.â Can you forgive me? May I die in peace? Saint Valori. Lo! thus with friendly hand I close thine eyes: Sleep, sleep! and be at rest from thy afflictions; Wou'd mine were laid beside thee in the grave! Hildebrand. Oh balmy comfort! Oh, how sweet to die!â Farewell for ever: do not quit my hand; Let it not go, till I am dead.âFarewell! [Dies. Saint Valori. He's dead;âhis soul forsook him with that sigh. Now, Sirs, returnâtis past; I have beheld Religion's triumph, a repentant death. Re-enter De Courci and Montgomeri. Call to your servants, and remove the body. Montgomeri. There is a charitable house hard by, Where on the ocean's edge a few poor monks, A slender brotherhood of Mercy, dwell; For human misery a small asylum; There often, from the foundering bark escap'd, The houseless wretch finds shelter, and his wounds, With balsams by the fathers cull'd, are dress'd: There we'll entomb the body. Saint Valori. Be it so! Montgomeri. You now alone survive the morning's wreck: You by peculiar providence are sav'd From a devoted vessel, which the sins Of its dire owner sunk; still I must wonder How God's own servant with a dÃ¦mon leagu'd, And piety with murder cou'd embark. Saint Valori. You think he was a murderer; have a care How you incline too rashly to such tales. Let not your vassals triumph and rejoice Too much o'th' sudden; let your castle keep Some remnant of its old propriety: And you, the champion, hang not up your lance In token of a bloodless victory, But keep it sharpen'd for a fresh encounter; And stick your valour to the test, young knight, Lest haply some new questioner should come, And dash your feast with horror. Montgomeri. Reverend stranger, It will become your order to desist From threats, which cover some mysterious meaning, And speak without disguise. You boast yourself Noble Saint Valori's friend, yet plead the cause Of Hildebrand, defend him from the crime Of murder, and with gloomy menace bid me Expect some new appellant.âLo! I'm ready. Saint Valori. Away, vain boy, away! Montgomeri. Vain let me be, Not of myself, but of the cause I stand for: The Lady of Saint Valori accounts me Worthy to be her champion, by that title I do impeach the memory of Lord Hildebrand; And in the presence of this Lord, whose person Stands for the King, arraign him as a murderer: If any loves his memory so well As to adopt his cause, let him stand forth, I pledge myself to answer. Saint Valori. Lord De Courci, Shall I reveal myself? I'm strongly tempted? [Aside. De Courci. I do protest against it; and conjure you, Whilst he is thus in train, leave it to me To draw confession up. Saint Valori. I am content. De Courci. Montgomeri, in virtue of my charge I've noted your defiance: should there come A knight of known degree to challenge it, Say, by what stile and title wilt thou answer? Montgomeri. Ask that of her in whose defence I stand. De Courci. We know thee for her champion; but declare, Hast thou no nearer name, no closer tie? Saint Valori. Answer to that.â'Tis palpable, 'tis gross: Your silence is confession. Montgomeri. Ah, good father, Have you so us'd confession as an engine To twist and torture silence to your purpose, And stain the truth with colouring not its own? Saint Valori. The man who flies to silence for evasion, When plainly questioned, aims at a deception Which candour's self will construe to condemn him. Montgomeri. Thyself a stranger, dark, inscrutable, With Hildebrand associate, thou to question me!â First answer for thyself. Saint Valori. For myself thenâ De Courci. Stop, recollect your thoughts! Saint Valori. Thanks, noble Lord!â For myself, then, I own I am your debtor For no less gift than life; and tho' that life Makes what you gave a gift of misery, Yet is the gift uncancell'd. Montgomeri. Set it down For nothing but the mutual debt of nature, Common from man to man.âTo-morrow's fun, With favouring winds to aid us, shall transport This castle's noble mistress and myself Across the streight that fevers this fair isle From its maternal shore; there to renew At Henry's feet, against this bloody man Newly deceas'd, our criminal appeal, Arraigning him for murder. Saint Valori. Hah! beware! Montgomeri. Who shall oppose it? Saint Valori. I; this noble witness; Truth, and the living evidence of sight. Montgomeri. To you, my Lord De Courci, not to him, Who is a son of peace, to you, a knight Seal'd with the Cross, and militant for truth, Thus I appeal.âWhat say you to our charge? De Courci. False, false; I pledge my life upon the proof. Montgomeri. Hah! by my father's foul, if thou shalt dare To whisper that to-morrowâ De Courci. If I dare To whisper it!âMy herald shall proclaim it; I'll cry it in the lists.âThere is my gauntlet. [throws it down. Saint Valori. Hold, I forbid itâ [Takes up De Courci's gauntlet. Brother of the Cross, Upon your knightly honour I conjure you Put up your gauntlet: I revoke the combat. Hear me, young Sir, you tread upon your grave; Fate waves the sword of vengeance o'er your head; I've pass'd it by, and paid you life for life. Lo! I provoke you to a gentler combat; Behold my peaceful gauntlet!âTake this jewel [Gives the bracelet. And an hour hence, when I am on my way, Shew it to her (what shall I call your lady?) To her that own'd it once. Montgomeri. I will obey you. What more have you in mind? Saint Valori. Tell her the Monk, Thro' all his pilgrimage from Holy Land Preserv'd it sacred; journeying night and day, By sea, by land, in shipwreck, in the waves, Still guarded it with reverence more devout Than holy relicks of departed martyrs. Now 'tis no longer worth: 'tis her's, 'tis your's, 'Tis the next favourite's prize, a transient bauble, The fleeting emblem of a woman's love.â No more: farewell!âCome, gallant Lord, to horse! [Exit with De Courci. Montgomeri. To horse! why so a warrior would have call'd; With such a step a warrior would have trod: A Monk!âMysterious man! I'll not believe it. This jewel may unfold the labyrinthâ What then? shall I commit the clue To sorrow's trembling hand, or firmly hold it Till more shall be discover'd?âTime direct me! End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. A Chapel, with an Altar decorated with the funeral Trophies of Saint Valori. Matilda is discovered kneeling at the Altar. Montgomeri enters, and, after a Pause, speaks. Montgomeri. Still at the altar! Ever on her kneesâ Nothing but peace! peace to her husband's soul! Perpetual requiems.âIf, as we believe, Th'uncircumscribed spirit of a man Walks after death, till it can find a grave, Or holy church, with soul-compelling hymns, Shall chaunt it to repose, I am amaz'd My father's ghost, whilst unappeas'd by prayer, Ne'er took it's shadowy journey to this spot. Why, when De Courci and the Monk outfac'd me, Did he not then arise with all his wounds, And scare them to confession? I am lost, Bewilder'd, and perplex'd! But see! she movesâ [Matilda arises, and comes down from the Altar to Montgomeri. Matilda. My son! my joy! my blessing! Montgomeri. Whence is this? What sudden transformation? By my hopes, There is a joyful emanation round thee, That strikes a gleam of rapture to my heart.â What angel of good tidings hath been with thee? Who hath exorcis'd thy despair, and breath'd This beam of placid pleasure in thine eyes? Matilda. Thy father hath been with me. Montgomeri. Heav'ns! my father! Matilda. I've seen him in my vision; commun'd with him Before the altar: soft his accents fell, Like voices of departed friends heard in our dreams, Or music in the air, when the night-spirits Warble their magic minstrelsy. Montgomeri. Indeed! Wou'd I had seen him too! Matilda. Wou'd Heav'n thou hadst! Montgomeri. What was his form? Matilda. Majestically sweet, He smil'd upon me; strait thro' all my veins Methought I felt a thrilling virtue run, Healing, where'er it cours'd, both heart and brain. Montgomeri. Saw you no wounds about him? Matilda. None, no wounds; Nor was he in his youth, as when he died, But grey with years, and much transform'd by time: At first I knew him not, and as he spoke So chang'd methought he was, with pain I trac'd The faded record. Montgomeri. Spoke he of his murder? Matilda. Oh! not a word; but as it ne'er had been, And he were living now, so look'd and spoke. Montgomeri. 'Tis strangeâone question more.âSay, did this form Ne'er visit you before? Matilda. Never, till now. Montgomeri. Nor this, nor any other shape? Matilda. Oh! never, never. Montgomeri. Then, then I own my confidence is shaken; And fit it is no longer to conceal What I have newly heard so boldly vouch'd, That my faith reels. Matilda. Speak, I conjure thee, speak! Montgomeri. I came this instant from the Carmelite And Lord De Courci: on the floor was stretch'd The breathless corpse of Hildebrand; the Monk In his last moments had been private with him: I urg'd the murder, to his own confession Appealing in my accusation's proof; When, strange to tell! his confessor the Monk Boldly denied that he had kill'd Saint Valori. Rous'd at this daring insult and indignant I turn'd upon De Courci, and demanded If he wou'd vouch the falsehood; he, more hot And no less confident than t'other, hurl'd Defiance in my teeth, and to the ground Threw down his gauntlet, pledging to the truth Of what the Monk affirm'd. Matilda. I am amaz'd; There is a trembling expectation in me, That by some secret impulse draws me on To the great revelation of my fate: Therefore proceed! Montgomeri. Before I could reply, The Carmelite had seiz'd De Courci's pledge, And with a tone and gesture more beseeming A haughty warrior than a son of peace, Sternly forbade the challenge to proceed: Then with a mournful action turning tow'rds me, And sighing, drew from forth his bosom this, This pearly chain. [Produces the bracelet. Matilda. Ah!âDo my eyes betray me?â Help, help! uphold me, whilst I look upon it.â The same; the same! I gave it to my husband; My last, fond, parting pledge: guide, guide my hands, My trembling hands to touch it.âSacred relick! Enthusiastic as the pilgrim's kiss, Thus to my lips I press thee.âHail, thrice hail! To thee, O altar, with these banners deck'd, Hallow'd with daily incense, and besieg'd With never-ceasing requiems for his soul, I dedicate this trophy of my love! Lead me, my son! Montgomeri. Oh! do'st thou love thy son? Matilda. Love thee! O Heaven! [Falls on his neck weeping. Montgomeri. By that then I conjure thee Come to thy couch! Now, as thy cheek turns pale, Convulsion shakes thy lip, and the full stream Bursts from thine eyes, return not to the altar: Let me conduct thee forth. Matilda. Where, where's the Monk? Shall I not see him? Montgomeri. Yes, thou suffering saint! Be patient for a while, and thou shalt see him. Matilda. Come then, dispose of me as to thy love And piety seems best: I will obey. Let me have thisâThou wilt not take this from me. [Holding the bracelet. Montgomeri. Not for the worth of all this world. Matilda. I thank thee. [Exeunt. Enter Saint Valori, De Courci, and Gyfford. Saint Valori. Suffer this last one weakness.âHah! she's gone; The chapel is deserted: I had hop'd Once more to have look'd upon her ere we parted. De Courci. 'Tis better as it is. Saint Valori. It may be so; And yet 'twere stern philosophy, methinks, That could refuse the sight one short indulgence, Ere the heart breaks with sorrow. De Courci. I am pain'd To see this tender sorrow swell so fast. Saint Valori. Oh! call to mind how I have lov'd this woman! Gyfford, thou know'st it; say, thou faithful servant, What was my passion; how did absence feed it? But how can'st thou compute my sum of sorrows? Years upon years have roll'd since thou wast with me: Time hath been wearied with my groans, my tears Have damp'd his wings, till he scarce crept along; The unpitying sun ne'er wink'd upon my toils; All day I dragg'd my slavery's chain, all night Howl'd to its clanking on my bed of straw; And yet these pains were recreation now, To those I feel, whilst I resign Matilda. Gyfford. Stay then, my noble master, here abide, And to this awful place convoke your Lady. Saint Valori. This awful place! she'll visit it no more; Or, if she does, 'twill be to strip these trappings; These mockeries shall come down, they've had their day, They've serv'd the uses of hypocrisy, And festive garlands now shall fill their place Around this nuptial altar. De Courci. No, my friend, I am a witness to her unfeign'd sorrows; And were I left to judge of them unbiass'd By what I saw besides, I should believe She were the very mirror of her sex For matchless constancy. Saint Valori. You rend my heart. Gyfford. Thrice on her knees this morning hath she wash'd This altar's feet with tears, and with her prayers Sent up a mingled cry of sighs and groans. Saint Valori. Why then, old man, did'st thou distract my soul With gossip tales to slander her fair fame, And murder my repose? If thou art conscious Of having wrong'd her, get thee hence, begone! Fall at her feet for pardon, howl for pity, And hide thyself where light may never find thee. Gyfford. With grief, but not with shame, I will retire From thee and light.âI have not wrong'd the truth. Saint Valori. Stay, Gyfford, stay, thou loyal, good old man! Pity thy master, and forgive my phrenzy. Lo! I am calm again: the pledge I've given To young Montgomeri shall be the test: Yes, with that chain I'll draw her to the proof; Link'd and entwin'd about her heart I'll hold it, And tent her nature to its inmost feelings.â See, the young favorite comes! Enter Montgomeri. Montgomeri. Oh! timely found, Well are you thus encounter'd, holy Sir! The lady of Saint Valori demands you; And lo! where she advances. Enter Matilda. Matilda. Hah! 'tis well. In presence of this altar we are met: And may the sacred genius of the place Prosper our interview! Saint Valori. Amen! amen! Matilda. Good friends, withdraw! let none approach the chapel Whilst we are private.âNow be firm, my heart! [They go outâshe pauses some time, and then addresses herself to Saint Valori.] Father, I thank you!âI've receiv'd your pledge, The small, but prizeless relick you have brought me. The bracelet, given by Lord De Courci's hands In times long past (fie, fie upon these tears, They will have way!) to a departed friend. Perhaps he priz'd this trifleâbut alas! 'Tis fated, like the arm from which 'twas taken, Never to clasp him more. Saint Valori. Alas! I fear it. Matilda. I hope De Courci gave it to my lord. Saint Valori. He did: I saw him give it. Matilda. Hah! you saw him! Saint Valori. When he embark'd for Palestine; I've told you We never march'd apart. I wore the Cross In those fame-seeking days. Matilda. I do remember. And this poor favour, did my hero wear it? Saint Valori. Devoutly, at his heart. Matilda. Then, then indeed Thou hast bestow'd a treasure.âWelcome, welcome! [As she is pressing it to her heart, St. Valori, observing her agitation, runs to her assistance. Saint Valori. He wore it like an amulet; with this Before his heart, first thro' the yawning breach Thy sacred walls, Jerusalem, he storm'd; Tore down the moony standard, where it hung In impious triumph; thrice their Pagan swords Shiver'd his mailed crest, as many times That sacred amulet was dy'd in blood Nearest his heart. Matilda. Stop there! I charge thee, stop! Tell me no more: Oh, follow him no further, For see, th'accursed PyrenÃ¦ans rise, Streaming with blood; there hellish murder howls; There madness rages, and with haggard eyes Glares in the craggy pass!âShe'll spring upon me If I advance. Oh, shield me from the sight! Saint Valori. Be calm, collect thyself: it was not there, It was not there Saint Valori met his death. 'Twas not the sword of Hildebrand that slew him; Tho' pierc'd with wounds, that ambush he surviv'd. Matilda. What do I hear? Oh, look upon this altar! Think where you stand, and do not wrong the truth. Saint Valori. He who is truth itself be witness for me!â Deep was the stroke that dire assassin gave, Yet short of life it stopt; unhors'd and fall'n, Welt'ring in blood, your wounded husband lay, Till haply found by charitable strangers Journeying to Venice, he was heal'd, restor'd; And, thence embarking, by a barbarous rover Was captur'd.âStart not; but repress your terrors. Matilda. Admire not that I tremble; marvel rather That I hear this and live.âSaint Valori captur'd! The bravest captain of the Cross enslav'd By barbarous Pagans! Saint Valori. Tedious years he suffer'd Of hard captivityâ Matilda. Oh, where, ye Heavens! Where was your justice then?âAnd died he there? Saint Valori. 'Twas not his lot to find a distant grave. Matilda. Where, where?âoh, speak! release me from the rack!â Where did my hero fall? Saint Valori. Where did he fall!â Nor Pagan swords, nor slavery's galling chain, Nor murderers daggers, Afric's burning clime, Toils, storms, nor shipwreck, kill'd himâhere he fell! Grief burst his heartâhere in this spot he fell! [He falls to the ground. Matilda. Ah, horror, horror!âHelp, for mercy, help!â My son, my son! your father lies before you. Montgomeri runs in, followed by De Courci and Gyfford. Montgomeri. My father! Heav'n and earth! Oh, save him; save him! Where shall I turn? See,see! she faints, she falls! [Supports her in his arms. De Courci. He is her son.âAwake, look up, my friend! Live, live! De Courci bids Saint Valori live. Your rival is your son. Saint Valori raising himself on his knee, unsheaths his dagger. Off! give me way: I'll kill him in her arms. De Courci. He is your sonâ Hear me, thou frantic father! I, De Courci, I speak to you.âWould you destroy your son? Saint Valori. Bind up his wounds. Oh, if I've slain my son, Perdition will not own me! Montgomeri. He revives. Nature awakens reason.âHush! be still. She stirs.âWithold him from her arms a while; Let all be silence, whilst disposing Heaven, That showers this joy, shall fit them to receive it. Matilda. How could you say my husband is alive? Which of you keeps him from me?âOh! 'tis cruel! Saint Valori. Uncase me of my weeds: tear off my cowl! Now, now she'll know me; now I am Saint Valori. [Throws off his habit, and appears in armour. Matilda. Stand off! Oh, blessed light of Heaven, shine forth! Visit my aching eyes, ye solar beams, And let me see my hero!âHah! the Crossâ He gleamsâhe glimmers;âlike a mist he rises.â He lives! he lives! I clasp him in my arms. My lost Saint Valori? my long-lost husband: [Runs into his Arms. Saint Valori. Oh my heart's joy! do I again embrace thee? Soul of all honour, constancy, and truth! Matilda. This transport is too quick, it melts my brain;â The sky runs round; the earth is all in motion;â Nay, now it whirls too fast. Saint Valori. Ye saints in bliss! Heroic matrons! Ye angelic virtues, Protect your fair resemblance!âHah! she weeps!â Kind tears, I thank you! Nature's soft relief, Waters, that from the soul's full fount run o'er, To joy or grief welcome alike ye flow, Assist our patience, and assuage our pain. Matilda. Alas! alas! that I shou'd know thee not.â What ravages have time and sorrow made In Heav'n's most perfect work, the fairest temple Nature e'er rear'd in majesty and grace! Saint Valori. What dire calamity have we escap'd! Now 'tis dispers'd, the mists of doubt are fled, Truth, like the sun, breaks forth, and all is joy.â My son! my son! oh, throw my arms about him, And let me cling for ever to his neck. Montgomeri. Oh sympathetic energy of nature!â This morn a nameless orphan, now the son Of living parents: he for virtue fam'd, For dignity of soul, and matchless courage; She for affection, constancy renown'd, Inspir'd with truth, with every grace adorn'd, A woman's fondness and an angel's faith. Matilda. Heaven hear my praises! echo them, O earth! Cherubs, that come with healing on your wings, Waft my thanksgiving back!âBright beam of mercy! Visit the inmost chambers of my heart; And where grief rear'd a husband's monument Fix now his living image: there, as time Shook not the faithful witness from my soul, When grief assail'd it, so in joy support me, And guard my constancy in both extremes. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE By the AUTHOR. Spoken by Mrs. SIDDONS. Ladies, we now have shewn a faithful wife, And trust our scene prevails in real life; We hope that nuptial truth's your reigning passion, If notâwhy let the stage begin the fashion: 'Tis ours to paint you innocent and true; To be what we describe depends on you.â Two tragic masters grac'd th'Athenian stage, One sketch'd with candour, t'other dash'd with rage: Old Sophocles's dames were heavenly creatures, His rival drew them all in fury features; Both err'd, perhaps.âThe milder urg'd this plea, âI paint my women as they ought to be:â The angry bard, relentless to the Fair, Sternly replied, âI paint mine as they are.â Our Author (pardon if he brings his name Too near to these of an immortal fame) At humble distance takes the milder plan, Less proud to be a poet than a man: Scorns first to forge and then enforce a crime, Or polish libels into truth by rhyme. If you have faults, alas! he bids me say, Oh! that his wish cou'd charm them all away! For if no cure but caustics can be found, He will not make a sore to heal a wound; If you have faults, they're faults he won't discover, To your own sex he begs to bind you over. So many ladies now there are who write, You'll hear of all your trips some winter's night: Since Pegasus has learn'd the jadish trick To hear a side-saddle, you'll find him kick. But let no satyrist touch my lips with gall, Lips from which none but grateful words shall fall. Can I forget?âBut I must here be dumb, So vast my debt. I cannot count the sum; Words would but fail me, and I claim no art, I boast no eloquenceâbut of the heart.</field>
