      <field name="fulltext">THE FEASTS OF VERSAILLES, In 1664.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The King, being desirous to give the Queens and his whole Court the pleasure of some uncommon Feasts, in a Place adorn'd with all the Delights that can make a Country-Seat be admired, chose for that purpose Versailles, four Leagues from Paris. 'Tis a Seat which might be call'd an inchanted Palace, so much have the imbellishments of Art seconded the Care nature has taken to render it perfect: It is every way charming, every thing smiles both on the inside and outside of it: Gold and Marble there dispute for Beauty and Lustre, and tho' it has not the vast Extent which there is in all his Majesty's other Palaces, yet all things therein are so polite, so well contrived, and so perfect, that nothing can equal them. Its simmetry, the richness of its Furniture, the beauty of its Walks, and the infinite number of its Flower-Pots, as well as of its Orange-Trees, render the Neighbourhood of that Place worthy of its singular Rarity; the sundry kinds of Beasts contain'd in the two Parks and the Menagery, wherein are several Courts in the Figures of Stars with Ponds for the Water-Fowl, together with great Structures, join Pleasure to Magnificence, and form an accomplish'd Palace.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST DAY. THE PLEASURES OF THE INCHANTED ISLAND. 'Twas in this beautiful Place that all the Court met, on the fifth of May, and the King treated above six hundred Persons till the fourteenth, not reckoning an infinite number of People necessary in the dancing and in the Play, besides all sorts of Artificers who came from Paris; so that it look'd like a little Army. The very Heavens seem'd to favour his Majesty's Design, since in a Season hardly ever without Rain, they come off with a little Wind, which appear'd as if it rose only to shew that the King's Foresight and Power were proof against the greatest Inconveniencies. High Curtains, buildings of Wood, run up almost in an Instant, and a prodigious number of Flambeaux of white Wax, to supply the Place of above four thousand Tapers every day resisted the Wind; which to another wou'd have render'd these Diversions almost impracticable. Monsieur de Vigarini, a modenois Gentleman, very skilful in all such things, invented and proposed these; and the King commanded the Duke of St. Aignan, who was then first Gentleman of the Bed-chamber, and who had before given several Plans of very agreeable Balls, to form a Design wherein they might all be comprehended with Connection and Order, so that they cou'd not fail of Success. He took for his Subject the Palace of Alcina, which gave occasion to the Title of the Pleasures of the inchanted Island; since, according to Ariosto, the brave Rogero and several other good Knights, were here detain'd by the double Charms of the Beauty, (tho' borrow'd) and the Learning of that Inchantress, and were deliver'd, after a long time spent in Delights, by the Ring, which destroy'd the Inchantment; 'twas that of Angelica, which Melissa in the shape of old Atlas, at length put upon Rogero's Finger. In a few Days then, there was fitted up a Round, wherein four great Alleys met amongst high Pallissadoes, with four Portico's thirty five foot high and twenty two foot square, and several Festoons enrich'd with Gold and divers Paintings with his Majesty's Arms. All the Court being seated in it on the Seventh, there enter'd , at Six of the Clock in the Evening, an Herald at Arms, represented by M. des Bardins, dress'd after the antique manner, in Flame-Colour embroider'd with Silver, and very well mounted. He was follow'd by three Pages, that of the King, (M. de Artagnan,) went before the two others, very richly dress'd in Flame-Colour, his Majesty's Livery, bearing his Lance and Shield, whereon shone a Sun of precious Stones, with these Words. Nec Cesso, nec Erro. Alluding to his Majesty's Application to the Affairs of State, and his manner of governing; which was likewise represented by these four Verses of the President de Perigny, author of the said Device. 'Tis with the highest Reason that the Earth, And Heav'ns behold, with Wonder, this rare Object, Who in his no less hard than glorious Race Does never take Repose, nor ever Errs. The two other Pages belong'd to the Dukes of St. Aignan and Noailles: The former Mareschal of Camp, and the latter Judge of the courses. That of the Duke of St. Aignan bore the Shield of his Device, and was dress'd in his Livery of Silver Cloth, enrich'd with Gold, with Carnation and black Plumes, the Ribbons the same. His Device was a Clock-Bell, with these Words, De mi golpes mi Ruido. The Duke of Noailles's Page was dress'd in Flame-Colour, Silver and Black, and the rest of the Livery agreeable to it. The Device which he bore on his Shield was an Eagle, with these words, Fidelis &amp; audax. Four Trumpets and two Kettle-Drums went after these Pages, dress'd in flame-colour'd Sattin, and Silver; their Plumes of the same Livery, and the Caparisons of their Horses cover'd with the same Embroidery, with Suns of Gold very glittering upon the Bandrols of the Trumpets and the Coverings of the Kettle-Drums. The Duke of St. Aignan, Mareschal de Camp, went after them arm'd in the Greek manner; with a cuirass of Silver Cloth cover'd with little Scales of Gold, as were his silk Stockings; and his Helmet was adorn'd with a Dragon, and a great number of white Feathers, mix'd with Carnation and Black: He rode on a white Horse, arm'd in the same, and represented Guidon the Savage. For the Duke de St. Aignan, representing Guidon the Savage. Those Combats in the dang'rous Isle I fought, When I so many Warriors did disarm, Follow'd by Battles of a softer sort. Did signalize my Force as well as Heart. Whether in lawful Fights my Strength I show, Or whether in forbidden Fields exert, Proclaim it, for my Glory, at both Poles, None, in each War, oftner or better strikes. For the same. Single against ten Warriors and ten Maids, 'Tis having two strange Contests upon Hand. Who comes with Honour from this double Combat, Must be a most unconquerable Soldier. Eight Trumpets and two Kettle-drums dress'd like the first, follow the Mareschal de Camp. The King representing Rogero, follow'd them upon one of the finest Horses in the World; the Harness of it, which was Flame-colour, shone with Gold, Silver and precious Stones. His Majesty was arm'd in the Greek manner, as were all those of his Troop, and wore a Cuirass of silver Plates, cover'd with a rich Embroidery of Gold and Diamonds: His Port and whole Action were worthy of his Rank; his Helmet all cover'd with Flame-colour'd Plumes, had an incomparable Beauty; and never did a more free or warlike Air raise a Mortal above other Men. For the KING, representing Rogero. What Shape, what Port this dauntless Conqu'ror wears! His Person dazzles each Beholder's Eye; And tho' by his high Post he is distinguish'd, Yet something greater sparkles in his Mien. His Front foretells his future Deeds; his Virtue Makes his high Ancestors forgot, and leaves 'em At Distance lagging in the Course of Glory. His generous Heart's most constant Application Is how to act for others, not himself; In this his Pow'r is gen'rously employ'd. He quite eclipses all the ancient Heroes; Honour's the only Mark he keeps in view, And always fights for Interests not his own. The Duke of Noailles, Judge of the Lists, by the Name of Oger the Dane, march'd after the King, wearing Flame-colour and Black, under a rich Embroidery of Silver, and his Plumes, as well as all the rest of his Equipage, were of the same Livery. For the Duke de Noailles, Judge of the Lists, representing Oger the Dane. This Paladin applies to this sole Business, To serve and please the greatest King on Earth: And as who judges well, as well must act, None from his Sentence justly can appeal. The Duke of Guise and the Count of Armagnac went together after him. The former by the Name of Aquilant the Black, wore an Habit of that Colour embroider'd with Gold and Jay-Colour; his Plumes, his Horse and his Lance being match'd to his Livery. And the other representing Griffin the White, wore over an Habit of Silver Cloth, several Rubies, and rode on a white Horse arm'd in the same Colour. For the Duke de Guise, representing Aquilant the Black. Beauteous is Day, nor does the Night want Charms, Black is my Colour, which I always lov'd: But yet tho' Darkness suits my amorous Passion, It never shall extend to touch my Fame. For the Count de Armagnac, representing Griffin the White. Behold the Candour Heav'n on me bestows; Beauty may safely trust to this fair Hue: And when I'm call'd to face the Enemy, I there will gain more Whiteness with my Sword. The Duke de Foix and Coaslin, who appeared afterwards, were dress'd, one in Carnation with Gold and Silver, and the other in Green, white and Silver. Their Livery and Horses were worthy the rest of their Equipage. For the Duke de Foix, representing Rinaldo. He bears a glorious Name, is young and sage: This, you will say, is soaring very high; Since but to few at such an Age, Heav'n grants, With so much Fire, a just Allay of Phlegm. For the Duke de Coaslin, representing Dudon. None can too far in Glory's Course engage, Tho' I seven Kings should by my Courage vanquish, And see them subject to Rogero's Power, I should not be content with my Exploit. After them march'd the Count of Lude, and the Prince of Marsillac, the former dress'd in Carnation and White, and the other in Yellow, White and Black, enrich'd with Silver Embroidery, their Livery of the same, and very well mounted. For the Count de Lude, representing Astolpho. Of all the Paladins the World contains, Sure a more amorous Knight was never seen: I still in fresh Adventures do engage, Tho' still inchanted by some youthful Fairy. For the Prince de Marsillac, representing Brandimart. My Vows will be compleat, my Wishes crown'd, My Fortune at its utmost Height arriv'd, When, lovely Lily, you my Zeal shall know. Indelibly within my Heart imprest. The Marquisses of Villequier and Soyecourt follow'd. One wore Blue and Silver, and the other Blue, White and Black, with Gold and Silver; their Plumes and the Harness of their Horses were of the same Colour, and of an equal Richness. For the Marquis de Villequier, representing Richardet. None ere, like me, with Galantry could quit A Love-Intrigue, where, doubtless, Art's requir'd: None, in my Mind, ere more agreeably Was faithful in deceiving of his Mistress. For the Marquis de Soyecourt, representing Olivier. Behold the Honour of the Age, to whom We when compar'd, nay Giants, scarce are Men: This arrant Knight, prepar'd for all that come, Has still his Lance in order for the Tilts. The Marquisses de Humieres and Valliere follow'd them. The first wearing Flesh Colour and Silver, and the other Gray and Silver; their whole Livery being the richest and best match'd in the World. For the Marquis de Humieres, representing Ariodant. When Love that fev'rish Passion of the Soul, Attacks me, I with Trembling own its Pow'r: Yet nothing shall my Spirits e'er controul, Or make me shake, but she whom I adore. For the Marquis de LA Valliere, representing Zerbin. Where'er grand Notions Glory may inspire, When to a sovereign degree we love; To die within her Arms whom we admire, Is of all Deaths the sweetest, in my Mind. Monsieur the Duke went alone, having for his Livery a Flame Colour, White and Silver; a great Number of Diamonds were fix'd on the magnificent Embroidery with which his Cuirass and Silk Stockings were cover'd; his Helmet and the Harness of his Horse being likewise enrich'd with them. For Monsieur the Duke, representing Orlando. Orlando far and wide his Lustre spreads; Glory observant does his Steps await, Sprung from a Blood that burns to seek the Field, I speak but truth, the Blood of Charles the Great. A chariot eighteen Foot high, twenty four long, and fifteen wide, appear'd afterwards, shining with Gold and divers Colours. It represented that of Apollo, in whose Honour were formerly celebrated the Pythian Games, which these Knights intended to imitate in their Courses and Equipage. That Deity, shining with Light, was seated on the Top of the Chariot, having at his Feet the four Ages, distinguish'd by rich Habits, and by what they bore in their Hands. The Golden Age, adorn'd with that precious Metal, was likewise set off with divers Flowers, which made one of the principal Ornaments of that happy Age. Those of Silver and Brass had also their particular Tokens. And that of Iron was represented by a Warrior of a terrible Aspect, holding his Sword in one Hand, and his Buckler in the other. Several other large Figures in Relievo adorn'd the Sides of the magnificent Chariot; the Celestial Monsters, the Serpent Python, Daphne, Hyacinthus, &amp;c. and the other Figures which are suitable to Apollo, with an Atlas bearing the Globe, were likewise agreeably carv'd. Time represented by the Sieur Millet with his Scythe, his Wings, and that Decrepidness, wherewith he is always painted, was their Conductor. Four Horses of an uncommon Size and Beauty, cover'd with large Housings, interspers'd with Golden Suns, and all in a Row, drew that Machine. The twelve Hours of the Day, and the twelve Signs of the Zodiack very superbly habited, as the Poets describe them, march'd in two Files on the two Sides of the Chariot. All the Knights Pages follow'd it two by two, after that of the Duke, very properly dress'd in their Liveries, with a great many Plumes, bearing their Masters Lances, and the Shields with their Devices. The Duke of Guise, representing Aquilant the Black having for his Device a Lion sleeping, with these Words, Et quiescente pavescunt. The Count of Armagnac, representing Griffin the White, having for his Device an Ermine, with these Words, Ex candore decus. The Duke of Foix, representing Rinaldo, having for his Device a Ship on the Sea, with these Words, Longè levis aura feret. The Duke of Coaslin, representing Dudo, having for his Device a Sun, and the Sun-Flower, with these Words, Splendor ab obsequio. The Count of Lude representing Astolpho, having for his Device a Cypher in the Form of a Knot with these Words, Non sia mai sciolto. The Prince of Marsillac, representing Brandimart, having for his Device a Watch in Relievo, of which all the Springs were visible, with these Words, Quieto fuor, commoto dentro. The Marquis of Villequier, representing Richardet, having for his Device an Eagle hovering before the Sun, with these Words, Uni militat Astro. The Marquis of Soyecourt, representing Olivier, having for his Device Hercules's Club, with these Words, Vix æquat fama labores. The Marquis of Humieres, representing Ariodant, having for his Device all sorts of Crowns, with these Words, No quiero menos. The Marquis of la Valliere, representing Zerbin, having for his Device a Phænix on a Pile set on Fire by the Sun, with these Words, Hoc juvat uri. Monsieur the Duke, representing Orlando, having for his Device a Dart wreathed with Laurel, with these Words, Certè ferit. Twenty Shepherds laden with several pieces of the Rails which were to be set up for the Tilting, form'd the last Troop that enter'd the Lists. They wore Vests of Flame-Colour, enrich'd with Silver, and Caps of the same. So soon as these Troops were entered the Camp, they went round it; and after having saluted the Queens, separated, and took each his Post: The Pages at the Head, the Trumpets and Kettle-Drums crossing posted themselves on the Wings. The King advancing to the middle, took his Place opposite to the high Canopy: The Duke near his Majesty, the Dukes of St. Aignan and Noailles on the Right and Left; the ten Knights in a Lane on each side of the Chariot; their Pages in the same Order behind them, the Signs and Hours as they enter'd. When they had made a halt in this manner, a profound Silence, caused by Attention and Respect, gave Mademoiselle de Brie, who represented the Age of Brass, an opportunity to begin these Verses in praise of the Queen, address'd to Apollo, represented by the Sieur de la Grange. The Brass Age to Apollo. Thou brilliant Father of the Day, whose Power Does by its various Aspects give us Birth; Hope of the Earth, and Ornament of Heaven, Thou fairest and most necessary God; Thou whose Activity and sovereign Bounty In every Place makes itself seen and felt: Say by what Destiny, or what new Choice, Thy Games are solemniz'd on Gallic Shores? Apollo. If all th'Address, the Glory, Valour, Merit, Which made Greece shine, are found on these blest Shores, Then justly hither are those Games transfer'd, Which, to my Honour, Earth has consecrated. I ever did delight to pour on France The balmy Influence of my gentle Rays; But the bright Dame whom Hymen there enthrones Makes me for her disdain all other Realms. Since for the wide Creation's Good so long I've made the boundless Tour of Seas and Earth, I ne'er saw ought so worthy of my Fires, Such noble Blood, so generous a Heart, Never such Lustre with such Innocence, Never such Youth with so much weigh'd Discretion; Never such Grandeur with such Condescention, Never such Wisdom joyn'd with so much Beauty. The thousand various Climates which are rul'd By all those Demi-Gods from whom she springs, Led by their own Devoir and her high Merit, United, will one day confess her Power. Whatever Grandeur France or Spain might boast, The Rights of Charles the Fifth, and Charles the Great, Auspiciously transmitted in her Blood, Will to her Throne subject the Universe: But a yet greater Title, nobler Lot, Which lifts her higher, and which charms her more, A Name which in it self all Names outweighs, Is that of Consort to the mighty Louis. Silver Age. By what unjust decree has Fate produc'd A Star so kindly in the Age of Iron? Golden Age. Ah! Do not murmur at the Gods Appointment! This Age which has the hate of Heav'n deserv'd, Instead of growing proud with that rare Blessing, Ought thence to augurate its approaching Ruin, And think a Virtue which it can't corrupt, Comes rather to destroy than to ennoble it. Soon as she chear'd the Earth with her blest Presence See how she chas'd away the rage of War; How from that very Day unweary'd Hands Labour the Happiness of human Kind. See by what hidden Springs a Hero strives To banish from a barbarous Age its horrors, And kindly to assist my Resurrection, With all those Joys which Innocence desires. Iron Age. I know what Enemies have plan'd my Ruin, Their Plots are known, their Stratagems are trac'd; But yet my Courage is not so far sunk— Apollo. Should all Hell's Monsters join in thy Defence, Feeble and vain would their Resistance prove Against such Grandeur and against such Virtue: Long with thy galling Yoak the World opprest Shall by thy Flight a happier Lot enjoy. 'Tis time that thou give way to the high Law Which an August and mighty Queen imposes; 'Tis time thou yield to the illustrations Labours Of a great King favour'd by Heav'n and Earth: But I too long with this Dispute am held, Yon Lists invite to much more gentle Combats, Come then, let's open 'em, and Laurels wreathe To crown the Brows of our renowned Warriors. All these Recitals being over, the running at the Ring began, wherein, after the King had made his Skill and Gracefulness be admired in that Exercise, as in all others, and after several fine Courses of all those Knights, the Duke of Guise, the Marquisses of Soyecourt and Valliere remain'd to Dispute, the last whereof bore off the Prize, which was a golden Sword enrich'd with Diamonds, with very valuable Buckles for his Belt, which the Queen Mother gave, and wherewith she honour'd him with her own Hand. They began their Running in such good Time, that just as they'd done it, Night came, and an infinite number of Lights illuminating that beautiful Place, there enter'd thirty four Musicians very well dress'd, who were to precede the Seasons, and made the most agreeable Concert in the World. Whilst the Seasons were lading themselves with delicious Viands, for the magnificent Entertainment of their Majesties, the twelve Signs of the Zodiack, and the four Seasons danced in the Ring, one of the finest Entries that was ever seen. The Spring afterwards appear'd on a Spanish Horse, represented by Mademoiselle du Parc; who with the Sex and advantages of a Woman, shew'd the Skill of a Man. Her Habit was green with Silver Embroidery, and artificial Flowers. Summer follow'd, represented by the Sieur du Parc upon an Elephant cover'd with rich Housing. Autumn as advantageously dress'd, represented by the Sieur de la Thorilliere, came next, mounted on a Camel. Winter, represented by the Sieur Bejart, follow'd on a Bear. Their Train was composed of forty eight Persons, who bore on their Heads large Basins for the Collation. The twelve first cover'd with Flowers, carried like Gardiners, Baskets painted with Green and Silver, garnish'd with a great deal of China, so full of Sweetmeats and other delicious Things of the Season, that they bow'd beneath the agreeable Load. Twelve others like Reapers, cloath'd in Habits conformable to their Profession but very rich, carry'd Basins of Carnation Colour which the rising Sun is of, and followed the Summer. Twelve dress'd like Vintagers, were cover'd with Vine-Leaves, and bunches of Grapes, and bore, in Panniers of a yellow Colour full of little Basins of the same Colour, divers other Fruits and Confitures in the train of Autumn. The twelve last were frozen old Men, whose Furs and manner of walking shew'd their Coldness and Weakness, bearing, in Basins cover'd with Ice and Snow so well counterfeited that one would have taken 'em for the thing it self, what was to contribute to the Collation, and follow'd Winter. Fourteen Musicians of Pan and Diana preceded those two Deties, with an agreeable Harmony of Flutes and Bag-Pipes. They afterwards came upon a very ingenious Machine in form of a little Mountain or Rock, shaded with several Trees; but what was most surprising is, that it was carry'd up into the Air, without discovery of the Artifice which gave it Motion. Twenty other Persons follow'd, carrying Meats of the Menagery of Pan and of Diana's Hunting. Eighteen of the King's Pages very richly dress'd, who were to wait upon the Ladies at Table, made the last of that Troop; which being ranged, Pan, Diana, and the Seasons presenting themselves before the Queen, the Spring first address'd these Verses to her. The Spring to the Queen. Of all the new-blown Flowers that deck my Gardens, Scorning the Jessamins, the Pinks and Roses, These Lilies I have chose to pay my Tribute, Which in your earliest Years you so much cherish'd. Lewis from East to West has made them shine, Whilst the charm'd World at once respects and fears them; But still their Reign's more soft and powerful too When, brilliant like, they beam on your Complexion. The Summer. Seiz'd with too hasty a Surprize, I bring A slender Ornament to grace this Feast; Yet know, before my Season's pass'd away, To crown your Warriours, in the Fields of Thrace, An ample crop of Laurels shall arise. The Autumn. The Spring, proud of the beauty of those Flowers Which to his Lot have fortunately fall'n, Thinks to have all th'advantage of this Feast And quite obscure us by his lively Colours. But you, you matchless Princess well remember, What precious Fruit my Season has produc'd, Which in your House does one Day mean to prove The darling and the blessing of Mankind. The Winter. The Snow and Isicles I hither bring, Are Viands far from being rare or precious; But they're most necessary in a Feast Where with their killing Eyes, a thousand Objects, Replete with Charms, so many Flames create. Diana. Our Woods, our Rocks, our Mountains, all our Hunters, And my Companions who have to me always Paid sovereign Honours, since they have beheld Your Presence here, will know me now no more; And laden with their Presents come with me To bring this Tribute to you, as a mark Of their Allegiance. The swift Inhabitants of these bless'd Groves, Make it their Choice to fall into your Nets, And only wish to perish by your Hands. Love, whose Address and Countenance you wear, Alone with you this wondrous secret shares. Pan. Be not surpriz'd, young Deity, that we In this fam'd Festival approach to offer The choice of what our Pastures can bestow. For if our Flocks their Herbage taste in Peace, 'Tis to your Charms that Happiness we owe. This ended a great Table is seen, in the form of an half Moon, round on the side where they were to serve, and garnish'd with Flowers on the other side which was hollow. Thirty six Violins, very well dress'd, were behind on a little Stage, whilst Messieurs de la Marche and Parfait, Father, Brother, and Son, controulers General, by the Names of Plenty, Elegance and good Cheer, caused it to be cover'd by the Pleasures, Sports, Smiles and Delights. Their Majesties sate down in this Order, which prevented all the Confusion which might have risen about Precedency. The Queen mother was seated in the middle of the Table, and had at her right Hand The King. Mademoiselle d'Alencon. Madame la Princesse. Mademoiselle d'Elbcuf. Madame de Bethune. Madame la duchesse de Crequy. The Duke of Orleans. Madame la Duchesse de St. Aignan. Madame la Maréchale du Plessis. Madame la Maréchale d'Etampe. Madame de Gourdon. Madame de Montespan. Madame de Humieres. Mademoiselle de Brancas. Madame d'Armagnac. Madame la Comtesse de Soissons. Madame la Princesse de Bade. Mademoiselle de Grancay. On the other side were sitting, The Queen. Madame de Carignan. Madame de Flaix. Madame la Duchesse de Foix. Madame de Brancas. Madame de Froulay. Madame la Duchesse de Navailles. Mademoiselle d'Ardennes. Mademoiselle de Coetlogon. Madame de Crussol. Madame de Montauzier. The Dutchess of Orleans. Madame la Princess Benedicte. Madame la Duchesse. Madame de Rouvroy. Mademoiselle de la Mothe. Madame de Marse. Mademoiselle de la Valliere. Mademoiselle d'Artigny. Mademoiselle du Bellay. Mademoiselle de Dampierre. Mademoiselle de Fiennes. The sumptuousness of this Collation exceeds all that can be written of it, as well for its Abundance, as the delicacy of Things that were served up: It made likewise the finest Object that the Senses were capable of; for in the Night-time, near the Verdure of those Pallisadoes, an infinite number of Candlesticks painted Green and Silver, each of them holding twenty four Tapers, and two hundred Flambeaux of white Wax, held by as many Persons in Masks, gave a Light almost as great, and more agreeable than that of Day. All the Knights, with their Helmets cover'd with Feathers of different Colours, and their running Dresses, lean'd on the Lists; and the great number of Officers richly dress'd, who waited, encreased its Beauty, and render'd that Ring an inchanted Place; from whence, after the Collation, their Majesties and all the Court, went out by the Portico opposite to the Lists, and in a great number of very commodious Calashes, resumed their way to the Castle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The SECOND DAY. The Sequel of the Pleasures of the Inchanted Island. When the Night of the second Day was come, their Majesties repair'd to another Ring, surrounded with Palisadoes like the former and on the same Line, still advancing towards the Lake, where the Palace of Alcina was suppos'd to be built. The design of this second Feast was that Rogero and the Knights of his Troop, after having done Wonders in the Courses, which by order of the fair Inchantress they had perform'd in favour of the Queen, should continue in the same Design in order to the following Diversion; and that, the floating Island not having remov'd from the French Shore, they might give her Majesty the pleasure of a Comedy, whose Scene lay in Elis. The King, then caus'd with surprising Expedition, all that Ring to be cover'd with Cloth in the manner of a Dome, to defend against the Wind the great number of Flambeaux and Candles which were to light the Theatre, the Decoration of which was very agreeable. There they represented the Comedy of The Princess of Elis. During the Dances, there rises from under the Stage the machine of a great Tree with sixteen Fauns in it, eight of which play upon the Flute, and the others on the Violin, with the most agreeable Concert in the World. Thirty Violins answer them from the Orchestre, with six other Instruments of Harpsichords and Theorboes, which were the Sieurs D'Anglebert, Richard, Itier, La Barre the younger, Tissu and De Moine; and four Shepherds and four Shepherdesses danc'd a very fine Entry, which the Fauns descending from the Tree mix'd in from time to time. The Shepherds were the Sieurs Chicanneau, Du Pron, Noblet, La Pierre; the Shepherdesses were the Sieurs Balthazard, Magni, Arnald, Bonard. All this Scene was so grand, so full and so agreeable, that there was never any thing of dancing finer seen; and such an advantageous Conclusion did it make to the Diversions of this Day, that the whole Court prais'd it no less than that which had preceded it, retiring with a satisfaction which gave them great Expectations of the Sequel of so compleat a Festival.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The THIRD DAY. The Sequel and Conclusion of the Pleasures of the Inchanted Island. The more they advanced towards the great Ring which represented the Lake, on which was anciently built the Palace of Alcina, the nearer they approach'd to the End of the Diversions of the Inchanted Island, as if it had not been just that so many brave Knights should any longer remain in an Idleness which would have done wrong to their Glory. 'Twas pretended therefore, still following the first Design, that Heav'n having resolv'd to free those Warriors, Alcina had some Presages of it, which fill'd her with Terror and Uneasiness: She resolved to provide all the Remedies that were likely to prevent that Misfortune, and fortify every way a Place which might secure her whole Repose and Joy. Within this Ring, whose Extent and Form were extraordinary, there appear'd a Rock situate in the middle of an Island cover'd with divers Animals, as tho' they wou'd defend the Entry of it. Two other Islands longer, but not so broad, were seen on the two Sides of the first, and all three, as well as the Borders of the Ring, were so very much illuminated, that these Lights produc'd a new Day in the Darkness of the Night. Their Majesties being arrived, had no sooner taken their Places, than one of the two Islands that were by the Sides of the first, was all cover'd with Violins very well dress'd. The other that was opposite to it, was at the same time cover'd with Trumpets and Kettle-Drums, whose Habits were no less rich. But what was more surprising was to see Alcina issue from behind the Rock, born by a Sea-Monster of a prodigious Bigness. Two of the Nymphs of her Train, by the Names of Celia and Dirce appear'd at the same time following her; and placing themselves on each Side of her upon great Whales, they approach'd the Brink of the Ring of Water; and Alcina began Verses, which her Companions answer'd, and which were in praise of the Queen, Mother to the King. ALCINA, CELIA, DIRCE. Alcina. You who in my Felicity have Share, Come, weep with me in this Extremity. Celia. What unexpected Cause of such Alarms? Who draws such Floods of Tears from those bright Eyes? Alcina. I can't ev'n think to speak on't without trembling. 'Midst the dark Horrors of a threatning Dream, A Spectre with a hideous Voice declar'd That Hell on my account suspends its Force, That a celestial Power arrests its Aid, And, this Day gone, that I shall be no more. All the malignant Influence of the Stars, Which adverse reign'd ascendant at my Birth, And all my Art had promis'd of Misfortunes, This Dream depainted in such lively Colours, That ceaseless to my waking Eyes it offers Melissa's Power and Brandimart's Misfortune. These Evils I foresaw, but the dear Pleasures, Which here seem'd even to prevent our Wishes; Our lofty Palaces, our Fields, our Gardens, The pleasing Converse of our dear Companions, Our Songs and Sports, the Concerts of the Birds, The Zephyr's fresh Perfume, the Waters Murmur, The sweet Adventures of our tender Loves, Made me forget those fatal Auguries; When that dire Dream, which still distracts my Senses, With so much Fury brought 'em to my Mind. Methinks I see my Troops each Moment routed, My Guards put to the Sword, my Prisons forc'd, A thousand Lovers by my Art transform'd, Who bent on my Destruction quit their Trunks And leafy Dwellings to take Vengeance on me; And last methinks I see my dear Rogero Ready to shake off my despised Chains. Celia. Fear in your Breast has gain'd too great an Empire. You reign sole here; for you alone they sigh; Nought interrupts the Course of your Contentment, But plaintive Accents of your mournful Lovers. Logistile and his Troops driv'n from our Fields Still quake with Fear, bury'd beneath their Mountains, And ev'n Melissa's Name, unheard of here Is only by your Aug'ries known to us. Dirce. Ah! let us not deceive our selves, this Phantom Held, this last Night, the same Discourse with me. Alcina. Alas! Who then can doubt of our Misfortunes? Celia. I see a sure and easy Remedy; A Queen appears, whose most auspicious Aid Will guard us from the Efforts of Melissa. The Goodness of this Queen is highly boasted. 'Tis said her Heart, whose Constancy despis'd The Insolence of the most daring Storms, Is ever open to her Subjects Vows. Alcina. 'Tis true, I see her. In this pressing Danger Let us endeavour to engage her Succour. Let's tell her that the publick Voice displays The charming Beauties of her Royal Soul. Say, that her Virtue, higher than her Rank, Adorns the Lustre of her noble Blood; And that our Sex's Glory she has born So far, that Times to come will scarce believe it. That her great Heart, fond of the publick Good, Gives her a generous Contempt of Dangers; Proof against ought that may befal her self, She apprehends for nothing but the State. Say that her Benefits profusely pour'd, Gain her the Love and Rev'rence of Mankind, That even the Shadow of an Ill that threats her Is Cause enough to put the World in Mourning. Say that at abs'lute Power's highest Point, Her Grandeur without Pride or Pomp appears; That in most dangerous Times her constant Prudence, Has fearless the Prerogative supported; And in the happy Calm gain'd by her Labours Restores it to her Son without Regret. Say, with what great Respect, what Complaisance That glorious Son rewards her for her Cares. Boast the long Labours, boast the righteous Laws Of that same Son, the greatest of all Monarchs; And how that Mother, fortunately fruitful, Giving but twice, gave so much to the World. In fine, the more to move her to Compassion, Let's use the Eloquence of Sighs and Tears, That we amidst our grievous Pain may find A peaceful Refuge at her royal Feet. Dirce. I know her Heart, magnificently generous, Receives the Voice of Misery with Pleasure; But yet she ne'er was seen t'exert her Power, Unless to shield the Innocent from Wrong; I know she all things can, but dare not think She'll stoop so low as to defend our Cause. She may have been inform'd of our soft Errors, And nothing is more clashing with her Conduct; Her well-known Zeal for Piety will render Our Interests odious to her spotless Virtue; And far from growing less at her Approach My Fear redoubling chills my troubled Spirits. Alcina. Oh! my own Fear's sufficient to afflict me. Instead of sharp'ning, sooth my Grief, and try To furnish my dejected Soul, with Means Of warding off the Ills that threaten it. Mean time let all the Palace-Guards be doubled, And if there be no Sanctuary for us, Let us in our Despair our Comfort seek, Nor yield our selves at least without Resistance. Alcina, Mademoiselle du Parc. Celia, Mademoiselle de Brie. Dirce, Mademoiselle Moliere. When they had done, and Alcina was gone to double the Guards of the Palace, a Concert of Violins is heard, during which, the Frontispiece of the Palace opening with wonderful Art, and Towers rising to View, four Giants of an unmeasurable Greatness appear with four Dwarfs, who by the Opposition of their little Stature, make that of the Giants seem still the more excessive. To these Colossusses was committed the Guard of the Palace, and by them began the first Entry. BALLET Of the PALACE of ALCINA. FIRST ENTRY. Giants. The Sieurs Manseau, Vagnard, Pesan and Joubert. Dwarfs. The two young Des-Airs, young Vagnard, and young Tutin. SECOND ENTRY. Eight Moors allotted by Alcina for the Guard of the Inside, make an exact Visit of it with, each, two Flambeaux. Moors. The Sieurs d'Heureux, Beauchamp, Moliere, la Marre, le Chantre, de Gan, du Pron and Mercier. THIRD ENTRY. Mean time an amorous Indignation prompts Six of the Knights that Alcina kept Prisoners, to attempt to get out of the Palace; but Fortune not seconding the Endeavours they make in their Despair, they are conquer'd after a sharp Combat by as many Monsters which attack them. Knights. Monsieur de Souville, the Sieurs Raynal, Des-Airs the Eldest, Des-Airs the Second, de Lorge, and Balthazard. Monsters. The Sieurs Chicanneau, Noblet, Arnald, Desbrosses, Desonets and la Pierre. FOURTH ENTRY. Alcina, alarm'd at this Accident, invokes a-new all her Spirits, and demands their Assistance: Two of them present themselves before her, leaping with a wonderful Force and Agility. Active Demons. The Sieurs St. Andre and Magny. FIFTH ENTRY. Other Demons come, and seem to assure the Inchantress that they'll forget nothing that may contribute to her Repose Leaping Demons. The Sicurs Tutin, la Brodiere, Pesan and Bureau. SIXTH and LAST ENTRY. But hardly had she begun to take Heart, before she saw the sage Melissa appear under the Form of Atlas, near Rogero and some Knights of his Train: She presently runs to hinder her from effecting her Intention; but she comes too late. Melissa has already put on the Finger of that brave Knight, the famous Ring, which destroys the Inchantments. Then a Clap of Thunder, follow'd by several Flashes of Lightning, portends the Destruction of the Palace, which is presently reduced to Ashes by a Firework which puts an End to this Adventure, and to the Diversions of the Inchanted Island.

It look'd as if Heaven, Earth and Water were all in a Flame, and as if the Destruction of the superb Palace of Alcina, as well as the Liberty of the Knights she there retain'd, cou'd not be effected but by Prodigies and Miracles; the Height and Number of Sky-Rockets, those which roll'd along on the Shore, and those which return'd out of the Water, after having been cast into it, made a Spectacle so grand and magnificent, that nothing could better terminate the Inchantments, than such fine Fireworks; which being at last ceased after an extraordinary Length and Noise, the Coups des Boetes which had begun it, redoubled again. Then all the Court retiring, confess'd that nothing could be more perfect than these three Feasts. And 'tis a sufficient Confession that nothing could be added to it, to say, that the three Days having each its Partisans, as every one of them had its particular Beauties, none cou'd agree which ought to bear away the Bell; tho' they all agreed that they might justly dispute it with all those that ever had been seen till then, and perhaps surpass them.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The FOURTH DAY. But tho' the Feasts comprehended in the Subject of the Pleasures of the Inchanted Island were ended, yet all the Diversions of Versailles were not so, and the Magnificence and Galantry of the King had reserved some for other Days, that were no less agreeable. On Saturday the 10th, his Majesty had a mind to run at Heads. 'Tis an Exercise which few People are ignorant of, and the Use whereof comes from Germany, very well invented to shew a Cavalier's Address, as well in managing his Horse in Turns of War, as in rightly using a Lance, a Dart and a Sword. If there are any who never saw them run at, they may here find a Description of it, being not so common as the Ring, and only brought hither of late: and those who have had the Pleasure of seeing 'em, may however bear with so short a Narrative. The Knights enter the Lists one after another with Lance in Hand, and a Dart under the right Thigh, and after one of them has run and bore off a Head of thick Past-board painted, and in Form of a Turk's, he gives his Lance to a Page, and making the half Volta, he returns on a full Gallop to the second Head, which is the Colour and Form of a Moor's, bears it off with the Dart which he strikes it with as he goes by; then taking a Javelin little different in Form from a Dart, in a third Turn he darts it in a Buckler, whereon is painted a Medusa's Head; and ending his demi Volta, he draws his Sword, wherewith, as he gallops by, he bears off a Head raised half a Foot from Earth; then giving way to another, he who, in his running, bears off most gains the Prize. All the Court being placed on a Ballustrade of Iron gilt, which went quite round the agreeable House of Versailles, and which looks into the Trench, wherein were prepar'd the Lists with Rails; the King repair'd thither, follow'd by the same Knights that ran at the Ring. The Duke of St. Aignan and Noailles continuing in their former Offices, one of Mareschal de Camp, and the other of Judge of the Courses; of which many were run, very handsomely and successfully; but the King's Skill gain'd him not only the Prize of the Ladies Course, but likewise that which the Queen gave. It was a Rose of Diamonds of great Value, which the King after having won it, freely gave to be run for by the other Knights, and which the Marquis de Coaslin disputed with the Marquis of Soyecourt, and gain'd.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The FIFTH DAY. On Sunday at the King's Levée, almost all the Conversation turn'd on the fine Running of the preceding Day, and occasion'd a grand Challenge between the Duke de St. Aignan, who had not yet run, and the Marquis of Soyecourt, which was deferr'd till the next Day, because the Mareschal Duc de Grammont, who wager'd on the Side of that Marquis, was oblig'd to go to Paris, from whence he was not to return till the next Day. That Afternoon the King carry'd all the Court to his Aviary, the particular Beauties of which were greatly admired, and the almost incredible Number of Birds of all Sorte, amongst which were several very scarce ones. 'Twou'd be useless to mention the Collation which follow'd this Diversion, since for eight successive Days every Repast might be esteem'd one of the greatest Feasts that could be made. In the Evening, his Majesty caused to be represented, on one of those double Theatres of his Sallon, which his universal Wit had itself invented, the Comedy of the Impertinents, written by the Sieur de Moliere.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The SIXTH DAY. The Rumour of the Challenge which was to be run on Monday the twelfth, caused an infinite number of Wagers of great value to be laid: tho' that of the two Knights was but an hundred Pistoles. And as the Duke by a happy Boldness gave one Head to that dexterous Marquiss, several laid for the latter; who coming somewhat late to the King found a Challenge to hasten him; which being only in Prose, we have not inserted it in this Discourse. The Duke of St. Aignan had likewise shewn to some of his Friends, as an happy Presage of his Victory, these four Verses. To the Ladies. If, O ye fair, your Sentiments agree With mine, you shall confess this Day, that He Who conquers Soyecourt conquers ten besides. still alluding to his Name of Guidon the Savage, whom the adventure of the dangerous Island made Conqueror over ten Knights. So soon as the King had dined he conducted the Queens, the Duke and Dutchess of Orleans, and all the Ladies, to a Place where a Lottery was to be drawn, that nothing might be wanting to the galantry of these Entertainments. 'Twas of precious Stones, Furniture, Plate and other like things; and tho' chance used to decide these Presents, yet it certainly accorded with his Majesty's Desire, when it gave the great Prize to the Queen; every one left that Place very well contented, to go see the Running which was going to begin. At length Guidon and Olivier appear'd in the Lists, at five a Clock in the Evening, very handsomely dress'd and well mounted. The King and all the Court honour'd them with their Presence, and his Majesty himself read the Articles of the Running, that there might be no difference between them. The Issue was fortunate to the Duke of St. Aignan, who won the Day. At Night his Majesty caused to be play'd the three first Acts of a Comedy call'd Tartuffe, which the Sieur de Moliere had made against the Hypocrites; but tho' the King thought it very diverting, yet he found so much Conformity between those whom a true Devotion puts in the way to Heaven, and those whom a vain Ostentation of good Works does not hinder from committing bad; that his extreme Delicacy in point of Religion cou'd hardly bear that resemblance of Vice and Virtue, and tho' he did not doubt the good Intentions of the Author, yet he forbad the publick acting of that Comedy, till 'twas entirely finish'd and examin'd by competent Judges, that it might not deceive others, who were less capable to make a just Discernment of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The SEVENTH DAY. Tuesday the 13th the King was pleased again to run at Heads, as a common Sport, wherein he who hit most was to win. His Majesty had again the Prize of the course of the Ladies, the Duke of St. Aignan that of the Sport; and having had the Honour to enter the next time into Competition with his Majesty, the incomparable Skill of the King gain'd him that Prize too, and 'twas not without an unavoidable Amazement, that the King was seen to gain four in two Times which he run at the Heads. The same Night was play'd the Comedy of the Forced Marriage, which was likewise the Work of the same Moliere; then the King took his way to Fontainebleau on Wednesday the fourteenth. All the Court was so satisfy'd with what they had seen, that every one was of Opinion it ought to be put in Writing, to give some Idea of it to those who did not see such diversified and agreeable Entertainments, wherein were at once to be admired the Project and the Success, the Liberality with the Politeness, the Multitude with Order, and the Satisfaction of all, wherein the indefatigable Pains of Monsieur Colbert were employ'd thro' all these Diversions, notwithstanding his important Affairs; wherein the Duke de St. Aignan join'd Action to the Invention of the Design, wherein the fine Verses of the President de Perigny in Praise of the Queens were so justly conceived, so agreeably turn'd, and repeated with so much Art; wherein those which M. de Bensserade made for the Knights had a general Approbation; wherein the exact Vigilance of M. Bontemps, and the Application of M. de Launay, let nothing that was necessary be wanting: In a Word, wherein every one so advantagiously testified his Design of pleasing the King, at a Time when his Majesty himself thought of nothing but pleasing; and wherein all that was seen will for ever continue in the Memory of the Spectators, tho' Care had not been taken to preserve in Writing the Remembrance of all these Wonders. THE END.</field>
