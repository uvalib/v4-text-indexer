      <field name="fulltext">FULGENS AND LUCRES</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here is conteyned a godely interlude of Fulgens cenatoure of Rome, Lucres his doughter, Gayus Flaminius, and Publius Cornelius, of the Disputacyon of Noblenes, and is devyded in two partyes to be played at two tymes. Compyled by mayster Henry Medwall, late chapelayne to the ryght reverent fader in God Johan Morton, cardynall and archebysshop of Caunterbury. Intrat A dicens: A A, for Goddis will, What meane ye, syrs, to stond so still? Have not ye etyn and your fill And payd no thinge therfore? Iwys, syrs, thus dare I say, He that shall for the shott pay Vouch saveth that ye largely assay Suche mete as he hath in store. I trowe your disshes be not bare, Nor yet ye do the wyne spare, Therfore be mery as ye fare! Ye ar welcom eche oon Unto this house withoute faynynge. But I mervayle moche of one thinge, That after this mery drynkynge And good recreacyon There is no wordes amonge this presseâ Non sunt loquele neque sermonesâ But as it were men in sadnes. Here ye stonde musynge, Whereaboute I can not tellâ Or some els praty damesell For to daunce and sprynge! Tell me, what calt, is it not so? I am sure here shalbe somewhat ado, And iwis I will know it or I go Withoute I be dryvyn hens. Intrat B. B Nay, nay, hardely man, I undertake No man wyll suche mastryes make! And it were but for the maner sake, Thou maist tary by licence Among other men and see the pleyâ I warand no man wyll say the nay. A I thinke it well evyn as ye say That no man wyll me greve. But I pray you, tell me that agayn: Shall here be a play? B Ye, for certeyn. A By my trouth, therof am I glad and fayn. And ye will me beleve, Of all the worlde I love suche sport. It dothe me so myche plesure and comfort, And that causith me ever to resort Wher suche thing is to do. I trowe your owyn selfe be oon Of them that shall play. B Nay, I am none. I trowe thou spekyst in derision To lyke me therto. A Nay, I mok not, wot ye well, For I thought verely by your apparell That ye had bene a player. B Nay, never a dell. A Than I cry you mercy: I was to blame. Lo, therfor, I say Ther is so myche nyce aray Amonges these galandis now aday That a man shall not lightly Know a player from a nother man. But now to the purpose wher I began: I see well here shalbe a play than! B Ye, that ther shall doutles, And I trow ye shall like it well. A It semeth than that ye can tell Sumwhat of the mater. B Ye, I am of counsellâ One tolde me all the processe. A And I pray you, what shall it be? B By my fayth, as it was tolde me More than ones or twyse, As fare as I can bere it awaye All the substaunce of theyr play Shall procede this wyse: When thempire of Rome was in such floure That all the worlde was subgett to the same, Than was there an nobill senatour, And as I remember, Fulgens was his name, Whiche had a doughter of nobill fame. And yet, as thauctor sayth in veray dede, Her nobill vertu dide her fame excede, All be it there was not one allmost Thoroughoute all the cyte, yong ne olde, That of her beaute did not boste. And over that, her verteuse manyfolde In suche maner wyse were praysid and tolde That it was thought she lakkede no thing To a nobill woman that was accordyng. Grete labour was made her favour to attayne In the way of mariage, and among all That made suche labour were specially twayn Whiche more than other dyd besily on her call, On the whiche twayn she sett her mynde especiall, So that she utterly determyned in her hert The one of them to have, all other sett aparte. One of them was called Publius Cornelius, Borne of noble blode, it is no nay. That other was one Gayus Flamyneus, Borne of a pore stocke, as men doth say. But for all that, many a fayre day Thorough his grete wisedome and vertueous behavyour He rulyd the comen wele to his grete honoure. And how so be it that the vulgare opynion Hade both these men in lyke favour and reverence, Supposing they had bene of lyke condycion, Yet this seyd woman of inestimable prudence Sawe that there was some maner of difference, For the whiche her answere she differred and spared Tyll both theyre condycions were openly declared. And yet to them both this comfort she gave: He that coude be founde more noble of them twayne, In all godely maner her harte sholde he have. Of the which answere they both were glade and fayne, For ether of them trustede therby to attayne Theffecte of his desyre. Yet when they had do, One of them must nedis his appetit forgoo. Hereuppon was areysyd a grete doute and question. Every man all after as he was affeccionate Unto the parties seyd his opynion, But at the laste, in eschewyng of debate, This matter was brought before the cenate, They to gyve therin an utter sentence Whiche of these two men sholde have the preeminence. And finally they gave sentence and awarde That Gayus Flamyneus was to be commende For the more nobill man, havynge no regarde To his lowe byrthe of the whiche he dyde dyscende, But onely to his vertue that dyde therin attende, Whiche was so grete that of convenience All the cyte of Rome dyd hym honour and reverence. A And shall this be the proces of the play? B Ye, so I understonde be credible informacyon. A By my fayth, but yf it be evyn as ye say, I wyll advyse them to change that conclusion. What? Wyll they afferme that a chorles son Sholde be more noble than a gentilman born? Nay, beware, for men wyll have therof grete scornâ It may not be spoken in no maner of case. B Yes, suche consyderacions may be layde That every resonable man in this place Wyll holde hym therin right well apaydeâ The matter may be so well convayde. A Let them convay and cary clene than, Or els he wyll repent that this play began. How be it, the matter touchith me never a dell, For I am nether of vertue excellent Nor yet of gentyl blode. This I know well, But I speke it onely for this entent: I wolde not that any man sholde be shent! And yet there can no man blame us two, For why in this matter we have nought to do. B We? No, God wott, no thing at all, Save that we come to see this play As farre as we may by the leve of the marshall. I love to beholde suche myrthes alway, For y have sene byfore this day Of suche maner thingis in many a gode place Both gode examples and right honest solace. This play in like wyse I am sure Is made for the same entent a[n]d purpose To do every man both myrth and pleasure. Wherfor I can not think or suppose That they wyll ony worde therin disclose But suche as shall stond with treuth and reason In godely maner according to the season. A Ye, but trouth may not be sayde alway, For somtyme it causith gruge and despite. B Ye, goth the worlde so now a day That a man must say the crow is white? A Ye, that he must, be God allmyght. He must both lye and flater now and than That castith hym to dwell amonge worldly men. In some courtis such men shall most wyn! B Ye, but as for the parish where I abide, Suche flaterye is abhorride as dedly syn. And specially lyars be sett asyde As sone as they may with the faute be spied, For every man that favoreth and loveth vertue Wyll suche maner of folke utterly esscheue, Wherfor I can think these folke wyll not spare After playne trouth this matier to procede As the story seyth. Why shulde they care? I trow here is no man of the kyn or sede Of either partie, for why they were bore In the cytie of Rome as I sayd before. Therfor leve all this doutfull question And prayse at the parting evyn as ye fynde. A Yes, be ye sure, whan thei have all done I wyll not spare to shew you my mynd. Praise who wyll or dispraise, I will not be behynd. I wyll gest theron what so ever shal befall If I can fynd any man to gest withall. B Pees, no moo wordes, for now they comeâ The plears bene evyn here at hand. A So thei be, so help me God and halydome! I pray you, tell me where I shall stand. B Mary, stand evyn here by me, I warand. Geve rome there, syrs, for God avowe! Thei wold cum in if thei myght for you. A Ye, but I pray the, what calt, tell me this: Who is he that now comyth yn? B Mary, it is Fulgence the senatour. A Ye, is? What? The father of the forseide virgyn? B Ye, forsoth, he shall this matere begyn. A And wher is feyr doughter Lucrece? B She comyth anon. I say, hold thy pece! Intrat Fulgens dicens: Fulgens Everlastyng joy with honoure and praise Be unto our most drad Lord and Savyour, Whiche doth us help and comfort many ways, Not lefyng us destitute of his ayde and socour, But lettith his son shyne on the riche and poore, And of his grace is ever indifferent All be yt he diversely commytteth his talent. To some he lendith the sprete of prophecy, To some the plenty of tonges eloquence, To some grete wisdome and worldly policy, To some litterature and speculatyf science, To some he geveth the grace of preemynence In honour and degre, and to some abundance Of tresoure, riches, and grete inheritaunce. Every man oweth to take gode hede Of this distribution, for who so doth take The larger benefite, he hath the more nede The larger recompense and thank therfor to make. I speke these wordes onely for myne owne sake And for non other person, for I know well That I am therin chargid as I shall you tell. When I consider and call to my remembraunce The prosperous lyfe that I have allwey Hyderto endured withoute any grevaunce Of wor[l]dly adversitie, well may I sey And thynke that I am bound to yeld and pay Grete prayse and thankes to the hye Kynge Of whom procedith and growith every gode thing. And certes, if I wold not praise of boste The benefytis that he hath done unto me, Yet is it well know of lest and most Thrughoute all Rome [t]hemperiall cyte What place in the cenate and honorable degre I occupye, and how I demean me in the sameâ All this can they tell that knowith but my name. To speke of plenty and grete abundaunce Of wor[l]dly riches therunto belongyng, Houses of pleasure and grete inheritaunce, With riche apparell and every other thing That to a worthy man shold be according, I am and ever have be in metely gode case, For the whiche I thank allmighty God of his grace. Than have I a wyfe of gode condicyon And right conformable to myn entent In every thing that is to be done. And how be it that God hath me not sent An hayr male, whiche were convenient My name to continew and it to repeyre, Yet am I not utterly destitute of an heyre, For I have a doughter in whom I delight As for the chefe comfort of myn olde age, And surely my seyd doughter Lucres doth hight. Men seyth she is as lyke me in visage As though she were evyn myn owne ymage, For the whiche cause nature doth me force and bynde The more to favour and love here in my mynde. But yet the principall and grettist occasion That makyth me to love her as I do Is this, whiche I speke not of affection But evyn as the treuth movith me therto: Nature hath wrought in my Lucres so That to speke of beaute and clere understanding I can not thinke in here what shold be lakking. And besides all that, yet a gretter thing Whiche is not oft sene in so yong a damesell: She is so discrete and sad in all demeanyng, And therto full of honest and verteous counsell Of here owne mynd, that wonder is to tell The giftes of nature and of especiall grace Am not I gretly bound in this case To God, as I rehersid you bifore? I were to voyd of all reson and grace If I wold not serve and prayse hym therfore With due love and dredeâhe askyth no more. As far as he will me grace therto send, The rest of my lif therin will I spend, Albe yt that I must partely intend To the promocyon of my doughter Lucres To some metely mariage, ellis God defend! She is my chief jewell and riches, My comfort agayn all care and hevynes, And also she is now of gode and ripe age To be a mannes fere by wey of mariage. Wherfor, if I might see or I dye That she were bestowid sumwhat accordyng, Then were my mynd dischargid utterly Of every grete cure to me belongyng. It was the chief cause of my hider cummyng To have a communication in this same matere With on Cornelius. Cam ther non suche here? Intrat Publius Cornelius dicens: Cornelius Yes, now am I come here at the last. I have taried longâI cry you mercy! Fulgens Nay, no offence. Ther is no waste Nor losse of tyme yet hardely, For this is the oure that ye and I Apoyntid here to mete this other day. Now shew me your mynd, lete me here what ye say. Cornelius Than wyll I leve superfluite awey, For why ye know alredy my minde in substance. Fulgens I wot not whether I do, ye or nay. Cornelius Why, is it now oute of your remembraunce That my desire is to honour and advaunce Your doughter Lucres, if she will agree That I so pore a man her husbonde shuld be? Fulgens Ye nede not, syr, to use these wordis to me, For non in this cyte knowith better than I Of what grete birth or substaunce ye be. My doughter Lucres is full unworthy Of birth and goodis to loke so hye, Savyng that happily her gode condicyon May her enable to suche a promocyon. But if this be youre mynde and suche intent, Why do ye not laboure to her therfore? For me semyth it were ryght expedient That we know therin her mynde before Or ever we shold commune therof any more, For if she wold to your mynde apply, No man shalbe so glad therof as I. Cornelius Suppose ye that I dyde not so begyn To gete fyrste her favoure? Yes, truste me well! Fulgens And what comfort wolde she gyve you therin? Cornelius By my feyth, no grete comfort to tell Save that she abideth to have youre counsell. For as she seyth, she will no thing In suche mater to do withoute your counsell[yng], Nor other wyse than ye shalbe contente. And theruppon it was my mynde and desire To speke with you of her for the same intent Your gode will in this behalfe to requyre, For I am so brent in loves fyre That no thing may my payne aslake Withoute that ye wyll my cure undertake. Fulgens Syr, I shall do you the comfort that I can As far as she wil be advised by me. How be it, certeynly I am not the man That wyll take from her the liberte Of her owne choiceâthat may not be! But when I speke with her, I shall her advyse To love you before other in all godely wyse. Cornelius I thanke you, syr, with all myn harte, And I pray you do it withoute delay. Fulgens As sone as I shall fro you departe I wyll her mynde therin assay, For I shall think that every howre is twayne Till I may speke with you agayne. [Exeat Fulgens.] Cornelius Now a wise felow that had sumwhat a brayne, And of suche thingis had experience, Such one wolde I with me retayne To gyve me counseile and assistence. For I will spare no cost or expence Nor yet refuse ony laboure or payne The love of fayre Lucres therby to attayne. So many gode felowes as byn in this hall, And is ther non, syrs, among you all That wyll enterprise this gere? Some of you can do it if ye lust! But if ye wyl not, than I must Go seche a man elliswhere. Et exeat. Deinde loquitur B: B Now have I spied a mete office for me, For I wyl be of counsell and I may With yonder man. A Pece, let be! Be God, thou wyll distroy all the play! B Distroy the play, quod a? Nay, nay, The play began never till now! I wyll be doyng, I make God avow, For there is not in this hondred myle A feter bawde than I am one. A And what shall I do in the meane while? B Mary, thou shalt com in anone With a nother pageant. A Who, I? B Ye, by Saynt Johan. A What? I never uside suche thing before. B But folow my counsell, and do no more: Loke that thou abide here still, And I shall undertake for to fulfyll All his mynde withouten delay. And whether I do so, ye or nay, At the lest, well dare I undertake The mariage utterly to mare or to make. If he and I make any bargeyn So that I must gyve hym attendaunce, When thou seest me com in ageyn, Stond evyn still and kepe thy contenaunce, For when Gayus Flamyneus comyth in Than must thou thy pageaunt begyn. A Shall ony profyt grow therby? B Hold thy pece! Speke not so hye, Leste any man of this company Know oure purpose openly And breke all oure daunce! For I assure the feithfully, If thou quyte the as well as I, This gere shall us both avaunce. Exeat. A Nay then, let me alone hardely! Yf ony advauntage honge therby I can my selfe thereto apply By helpe of gode counsell. This felowe and I be maysterles And lyve moste parte in ydelnes, Therefore some maner of besenes Wolde become us both well. At the leste wyse, it is mery beynge With men in tyme of woynge, For all that whyle they do no thynge But daunce and make revell, Synge and laugh with greate shoutynge, Fyll in wyne with revell routynge. I trowe it be a joyfull thinge Amonge suche folke to dwell! Intrat Fulgens, Lucres, et Ancilla, et dicat: Fulgens Doughter Lucres, ye knowe well ynough What study and care I have for youre promocyon And what fatherly love I bere to you, So that I thynke in myne opynyon It were tyme loste and wastfull occupacyon This matter to reherse or tell you ony more, Syth ye it best knowe, as I sayde before. But the specyall cause that I speke fore Is touchynge youre mariage. As ye knowe well, Many folke there be that desyreth sore And laboureth in that behalve with you to mell. Ye knowe what is for you, ye nede no counsell. Howe so be it, yf ye lyste my counseyle to requyre, I shall be glad to satysfye therein youre desyre. Lucres Trought it is, fader, that I am bounde As moche unto you as ony chylde may be Unto the fader lyvynge on the grounde, And where it pleaseth you to gyve unto me Myne owne fre choyse and my lyberte, It is the thynge that pleaseth me well Sith I shall have therein youre counsell. And nowe accordynge to this same purpose, What thynke ye best for me to do? Ye knowe ryghte well, as I suppose, That many folke doth me greatly woo, Amonge the whiche there be specyally twoo In whome, as I trowe and so do ye, The choyce of this matter must fynally beâ In that poynt your mynde and myne dothe agre. But yet, ryght now er I came here, For Publius Cornelius ye advysed me, As touchinge ye wolde have me only reste there. Yf that be youre mynde I shall gladly forbere All other, and only to hym assente To have me in wedlocke at his commaundemente. Fulgens Naye, doughter Lucres, not so I mente, For though I dyde somwhat to hym enclyne, Yet for all that it is not myne entente That ye shulde so thereupon utterly diffyne, But loke whom ye wyll on Godys blessing and myne! For truste ye me verely, it is all one to me Whether Gayus Flamyneus wedde you or els he. Lucres Than syth I have so greate lyberte And so gode choyce, I were unfortunable And also to unwyse yf I wolde not see That I had hym whiche is moste honorable. Wherfore may it lyke you to be agreable That I may have respyte to make inquisycyon Whiche of this two men is better of condicyon. Fulgens I holde me content, that shall be well done. It may be respyted for a day or twayne, But in the meane tyme use this provysyon: Se that ye indyfferently them both entertayne Tyll that youre mynde be sett at a certayne Where ye shall rest now. Can ye do so? Lucres At the leste, my gode wyll shall I put thereto. Fulgens Than syth I have bysynes at whome for to do, I wyll go thetherwarde as fast as I may. Lucres Is it youre pleasure that I shall with you go? Fulgens Nay, I had lever that ye went your way Aboute this matter. Et exeat. Lucres Well, God be with you than! I shall do therein the best that I can. Et facta aliqua pausatione dicat Lucres: Lucres I wyll not dysclaunder nor blame no man, But neverthelesse, by that I here saye, Pore maydens be dissayved now and than. So greate dyssemblynge now a daye There is convayed under wordes gaye, That if ... Ancilla Peace, lady, ye must forbere! Se ye not who cometh here? Lucres Who is it, wot ye ere? Ancilla It is Gayus Flamyneus, parde, He that wolde your husbonde be. Lucres Ey, gode Lorde, how wyste he For to fynde me here? Intrat Gayus Flaminius. Gayus Yes, gode lady, where so ever ye go, He that lysteth to do his dylygence In suche manere wyse as I have do, At the laste he may come to youre presence. For who so ever oweth obedyence Unto love, he hath greate nede To attendaunce if he wyll spede. Lucres Syr, ye be welcome. What is your mynde? Gayus Why, fayre Lucres, is that your gyse, To be so straunge and so unkynde To hym that owith you lovyng servyce? I trow I have tolde you twyse or thrise That myn desyre is to mary with you. Have ye not herde this matter or now? Lucres Yes, in veray trouth, I have herde you say Att dyverse tymes that ye bare me affeccyon: To suche an intent I say not nay. Gayus What nede ye than to aske the question What I wolde with you at this season? Me semyth ye sholde therin doubt no more Sith ye know well myn erande before. Iwys, your strangnes greveth me sore, But not withstonding, now wyll I sece, And at this tyme I wyll chide no more Lest I geve you cause of hevynes. I cam hyder onely for youre sake, doubtles, To glade you and please you in all that I can, And not for to chyde with you as I began. For thynke it in your mynde, I am the man That wolde you please in all that I may, And to that purpose I wyll do what I can Though ye forbyde it and say therin nayâ In that poynt onely I wyll you disobay. My hart shall ye have in all godely wise Whether ye me take or utterly dispise. And to say that I will folow the gise Of wanton lovers now aday, Whiche doth many flatering wordis devise With gyftis of ringis and broches gay Theyr lemmans hartis for to betray, Ye must have me therin excusid, For it is the thing that I never usid. Therfore I will be short and playne, And I pray you hartely, feyre Lucres, That ye wyll be so to me agayne. Ye know well I have made labour and besynes And also desyrid you by wordis expresse That ye wold vouche save in your harte To be my wife till deth us departe. Lo, this is the mater that I come fore: To know therin your mynde and plesoure, Whether ye sett by me ony store To theffect of my seyd desire. And nothing ellis I wyll require But that I may have a playne ye or nay, Whereto I may trust withoute delay. Lucres Me thinketh that by that that ye say, Ye force not what myne answere be! Gayus A, wyll ye take it that way? My lady, I ment not so parde. Thaffirmatyfe were most lefe to me, For as ye your self knowith best, That was and is my principall request. But ye may say I am a homely gest On a gentil[wo]man so hastely to call. Lucres Nay, nay, syr, that guyse is best! Ye can not displeyse me with all, And accordyng to your desire I shall Evyn as sone as I godely may Answere you therin withoute delay. How be it, it can not be done strait way If I myght gett a realme therby. Fyrst wyll I my faders mynde assay Whether he wyll therunto applye. For if he like you as well as I, Your mynde in this behalf shalbe sone easid If my seyd fader can be content and pleysid. Gayus Gramercy, myne owne swete Lucres. Of you desire can I no more at all, Save onely that ye do your besynes Upon youre fader besily to call, So that what so ever shal befall, Within few days I may verily know To what effect this mater shal grow. Lucres Ye shall know by tomorow nyght What my fader wyll sey therto. Gayus Than shall ye make myne harte full light If it pleyse you so to do. Lucres Yes, doubt ye not it shal be so, And for that cause I wyll even now departe. Gayus Now fare well than, myne owne swete harte. Et exeat Lucres [et Ancilla]. Deinde A accedens ad Gayum Flaminium dicat ei sic: A Syr, ye seme a man of grete honoure, And that moveth me to be so bolde: I rede you, adventure not over moche laboure Upon this woman, leste ye take colde. I tell you, the mater is bought and solde! Withoute ye take the better hede, For all these feyre wordes ye shall not spede! Gayus Thynkest thou so in very dede? A Ye, so helpe me God, and I shall tell you why: Syr, ryght now, this way as I yede, This gentylwoman cam even by, And a fresshe galant in her company. As God wolde, nere them I stalked And herde every worde that they talked. Gayus But spake they ony worde of me? A Nay, nay, ye were no thinge in her thoughte. They were as besy as they myghte be Aboute suche a matter as ye have wroughte. And by God that me dere boughte, Loke what answer that ye now have, Even the same wordes to hym she gave. Iwys, syr, I am but a pore knave, But yet I wolde take on me a greate payne Youre honeste in this matter to save, Though it be unto me no profyte nor gayne. But therefore I speke and have dysdayne To se in a woman suche dyssemblaunce Towarde a gentylman of youre substaunce. Gayus Why, hast thou of me ony acquentaunce? A Ye, syr, and some tyme ye knewe me, Though it be now oute of youre remembraunce. Gayus By my fayth it may well be, But never the lesse I thanke the. Me semeth thou woldest that all were well Betwyxte me and yonder fayre damesell. A Ye, by God, I wolde fyghte in the quarell Rather than ye sholde lese youre ente[n]te. Gayus I praye the felowe, where doste thou dwell? A By my fayth, I am now at myn owne commaundementâ I lacke a mayster, and that I me repente. To serve you and please I wolde be fayne Yf it myght lyke you me to retayne. And of one thynge I wyll, a certayne: I doubte not I shall do you better stede Towarde this maryage than some other twayne, And yf I do not, let me be dede! Gayus Well, than wyll I do by thy rede, And in my servyce thou shalt be Yf thou canst fynde me any surete. A Yes, I can have sureties plente For my trouth within this place. Here is a gentilman that wolde truste me [Points to B.] For as moche gode as he hase. Gayus Ye, and that is but litle percase. A By my fayth, go where he shall, It is as honest a man as ony in the reall. I have no more acqueyntaunce within this hall If I wolde ony frendis assay. [B comes forward.] By God, here is one best of all! I trow he wyll not say me nay, For he hath knowen me many a day. Syr, wyll not ye for my trouth undertake? B Yes, for God, els I wolde I were bake! Syr, my maister, wyll ye beleve me? I dare trust hym for all that I can make, Yf ye fynde me sufficient surete. As for his trouth, doubt not ye! I never coude by hym any thing espie But that he was as true a man as I. He and I dwelled many a feyre day In one scole, and yet I wot well From thens he bare never away The worth of an halfe peny that I can tellâ Therfore he is able with you to dwell! As for his trought, that dare I well saye, Hardely truste hym therein ye maye. Gayus Upon youre worde I shall assaye, And, syr, after thi gode deservynge, So shall I thy wagys pay. But now to remembre one thinge: Me thought thou saydist at the begynnynge That Lucres favoreth better than me A nother lover. What man is he? A Cornelius I wene his name sholde be. Gayus A, then, I knowe him well, by the rode! There is not within all this cyte A man borne of a better blode. But yet Lucres hath a wytt so gode That as I thynke she wyll before see Whether his condicyons therto agree, And if they do not, fare well he! But therin I have nought ado. He shall not be dispraysid for me Withoute that I be compellid therto. I can not let hym for to woo A woman beyng at her owne liberte, For why it is as fre for hym as for me. I wyll forbere never the more Tyll I knowe what shall be the ende. Go thy waye unto Lucres therfore And hertly me unto her recommende, Prayng her that she wyll me sende A redy answere of that thing That she promised me at her departing. A Mary, I shall, without any tarying. I knowe myne erand well inow: Ye shall se me apoynte a metynge Where she agayne shall speke wyth you. Gayus Than shall I thy wyt alowe Yf thou can brynge that aboute! A Yes, that I shall do, have ye no doubte! Et exeat Gayus Flaminius, et dicat B: B Now by my trought, I wolde not have thoughte That thou haddest bene halfe so wyse, For thou hast this matter featly wrought And convayed it poynt devyse To brynge thy selfe to suche a servyceâ I se well thou hast some wytt in thy hede! A Ye, a lytell. But hast thou spede? B Even lyke wyse, have thou no drede, I have goten a maister for my proweâ I never thryvede as I shall do now! A No? Whiche way? B I shall tell the how: It is no maystry to thryve at all Under a man that is so liberall. Ther is now late unto hym fall So grete goodis by inheritaunce That he wote never what to do with all, But lassheth it forth daily escaunce That he had no dayly remembraunce Of tyme to come, nor makyth no store, For he carith not whiche ende goth before. And by oure Lady, I commende hym the more! Why sholde he those goodis spare, Sith he laborede never therfore? Nay, and every man sholde care For goodis, and specially suche as are Of gentil blode, it were grete syn, For all liberalite in them sholde begyn. Many a pore man therby doth wyn The chef substauns of his lyving. My maister were worthy to be a kyng For liberall expensis in all his deling! I trow thou shalt se hym com yn Lyke a rutter somwhat according In all apparell to hym belongyng. How moche payeth he, as ye suppose, For the makyng of a peyre of his hose? A Mary, twelve pence were a feyre thing. B Ye by the rode, twenty tymes tolde, That is evyn twenty shelyngis for the makyng! A It can not be so withoute a man wolde Make them all with sylke and golde! B Nay, by Jys, non erthly thing But evyn the bare cloth and the lynynge! Save onely that ther is in cuttinge A new maner of fascyon now a day: Because they sholde be somwhat straunge, They moste be strypide all this way With small slypes of coloures gay, A codpece before allmost thus large, And therin restith the gretist charge! To speke of gowns and that gode chaunge, Of them he hath store and plenty, And that the fascyons be new and straunge, For non of them passith the mydde thy. And yet he puttyth in a gown communelyâ How many brode yardis, as ye gesse? A Mary, two or thre. B Nay, seven and no lesse! A By my trouth, that is lyke a lye! B But it is as true as ye stond there, And I shall tell you a reson why: All that doth that fascyon were, They have whingis behynd redy to flye, And a sleve that wolde cover all the body! Than forty playtis, as I think in my mynde, They have before, and as many behynde. A Well, as for gentilmen, it is full kynde To have theyr plesyrs that may well paye. B Ye, but than this grugeth my mynde: A gentylman shall not were it a daye, But every man wyll hym self araye Of the same fascyon even by and by On the morow after! A Nay, that I defy! But then I marvell gretly why You are not garnysshyd after that gyse. B There is never a knave in the house save I But his gowne is made in the same wyse, And for bycause I am new come to servyce, I must for a whyle be content To were stylle myn olde garment. A Ye, but abyde! To what intent Doth thy mayster take in honde To make hym so moche costely rayment? B Mary, that is esy to understonde: All is done for Lucres sakeâ To wedde her he doth his rekenynge make. A I put case that she do hym forsake So that she be my maysters wyf? B By my fayth, then I say it wyll make Many a man to lose his lyf, For therof wyll ryse a gret stryf! A Mary, I pray God send us pes! B Be my fayth, it wyll be no lesse Yf my master have not Lucres. A I can no more, God sped the ryght! Lo, thes folke wyll stryve and fyght For this womans sake, And whan thay have done ther uttyrmest, I wene veryly he shall sped best That must her forsake! He is well at ease that hath a wyf, Yet he is better that hath none, be my lyf! But he that hath a good wyf and wyll forsake her, I pray God the devyll take her! B Now in gode fayth thou art a made knaveâ I se well thou hast wedyd a shrew! A The devyll I have! Nay, I have marryed two or thre Syth the tyme that I her lost. B And kepist thou them all styll with the? A Nay, that wolde not quyte the cost. To say the trouth, thay fond me most. B Than thay have some maner gettynge By some occupacione, have thay? A Syr, thay have a prety waye! The chef meane of ther levynge Is lecheryâlech crafte I wolde sayâ Wherein thay labore nyght and day And ease many a man in some case. B And where do thay dwell? A Att the Commen Placeâ There thou mayst them all fynde! Goddis mercy, where is my mynde? By God, I shall be shent! I shold have gone to Lucres Abowte my maysters besynesâ Thetherwarde I was bent. B By my fayth, my mayster is there All the whyle that thou arte here, As I veryly suppose. A I shrow thy face, by Saynt Mary! With thy chaterynge thou doyst me tary Evyn for the same purpose. B I say, whan thou hast with Lucres spoken, I pray the, wyll thou delyver me a token In myne name to her mayde? A Nay, ye muste be ware of that gere, For I have bene afore you there. B Why, hast thou hyr assayed? A Ye, ye, that matyr ys sped full. I may have her and she wullâ That comfort she me gave! B And hast thou no noder comfort att all? I truste to God than yet I shall All this matyr save. How be it, I wyll not the matter begyn Withoute I were sure she were a virgyn. A By my trought, this comfort shall I putt the inâ I cam never on her backe in the way of synne. Avoyde the place A. B Than all is well and fyne Yf the matter be in that case! I trust that within a lytyll space That wenche shall be myne. I tell you it is a trull of trust All to quenche a mannes thrust Bettyr then ony wyne! It is a lytyll praty moucet, And her voyce is as doucett And as swete as resty porke. Her face is some what browne and yelow, But for all that she hath no felow In syngynge hens to Yorke. But the worst that grevyth me, She hath no layser nor lybarte For an howre or twayne To be owte of her maystres syght. I wachyde for her this odyr nyght, But all was in vayne! How be it, I thinke that at the laste Come in the maydyn. I shall come within two stonys caste Of herâI aske no more. And yf I do so, then my mate Shall have no lust therin to prate As he dyde before! Cockis body, here she is! Now wellcome by hevyn blys, The last that was in my thought! Ancilla Tusshe, I pray you, let me go! I have somewhat els to do, For this howre I have soughte A man that I sholde speke with all Fro my maystres. B What do you hym call? Ancilla Mayster Gayus or his man. B Am not I he that ye wolde have? Ancilla No, no, I wolde have an other knave! B Why, am I a knave than? Ancilla Nay, I sayd not so perde. But where trow ye these folkis be? B I can not veryly say. His man went evyn now frome me And I marvell gretly that ye Met hym not by the way, For he is gone to speke with Lucres From his maystyr. Ancilla What, with my maystres? Nay! B Ye, so I harde hym say. Ancilla Goddis mercy, and I was sent Evyn hedyr for the same intent To brynge an answere Of the erande that he is gone fore, Wherefore now ther is no more But I must go seche hym there. B Nay, tary here a whyle gentyll Jone, For he wyll come hedyr anone. Ancilla Tary? Why shold I so? B Mary, to laugh and talke with me. Ancilla Nay, loke where suche gyglottis be, For I am none of them, I warne the, That use so to do. B I mene no thinge but good and honest And for your wele, and you lyst To assent therunto. Ancilla For my wele, quod a? How may that be? That is a thinge that I can not se. B Mary, this, lo, is myne entent: I mene, yf ye wolde be content Or ony wyse agree For to be my sacrament of penaunceâ Ey, God gyve it a very vengeaunce!â Of wedlocke I wolde have sayde! Ancilla Tush, by Seynt Jame, ye do but mocke To speke to me of ony wedlocke, And I so yonge a mayde! B Why, are ye a mayde? Ancilla Ye, ellis I were to blame. B Where by wote ye? Ancilla Mary, for I ame. B A, that is a thinge! Here ye not, syrs, what she sayth? So resonable a cause thereto she layth! Ancilla A straw for your mockynge! Have ye none to mocke but me? B Mocke? Nay, so mote I the, I mene evyne gode ernest! Geve me your honde and you shall se What I wyll promes you. Ancilla That way were not best for my prow! Wold ye hondefast me forth with all? Nay, be the roode, fyrst ye shall Chepe or ever you by! We must fyrst of the price agre, For who some ever shall have me, I promes you fayt[h]fully, He shall me fyrst assure Of twenty pound londe in joyncture. B Why, are ye so costely? Nay, nay, then ye be not for me. As prety a woman as ye be I can some tyme by For moche les wagis and hyre As for the season that I desyre To have hyr in company. Therefore, yf ye can fynde in youre harte To leve all sucche joynter aparte And take me as I am, I shall do you as greate a pleasure And therto I wyll love you oute of mesure, Els I were to blame. Ancilla Ye, but oure housholde shall be full small But yf we have somewhat els with all Oure charges for to bere. B Ye, God sende us mery wether! I may not wed and thryve all togetherâ I loke not for that gere. I shall tell you a marvelous case: I knewe twayne marryed in a place Dwellyng together in one house, And I am sure they were not worth a louse At the begynnynge. And or ever the yere were do, They were worth an hondred or two! Ancilla That was a marvelous thynge! But yet I can tell the a gretter marvayle, And I knewe the persons ryght well: Syr, I knewe two certayne, That when they were wedded, they had in store Scarce halfe a bed and no more That was worth an hawe, And within a yere or twayne They had so greate encrease and gayne That at the last they were fayne To shove theyre hedes in the strawe! B Tusshe, ye do but mocke and rayle! And I promesse you withouten fayle, Yf ye lyste to have me, I woot where is an hundred pound in store, And I ow never a grot therfore! Ancilla All that may beâ I beleve hyt evyn as ye say. But ye tary me here all day, I pray you let me goo! And for my mariage, that is a thing In the whyche I purpose to geve a sparyng For a yere or two. B A yere or two, quod a? Nay, God forbede! Iwis, hyt had be tyme fore you to wedde Seven or eight yere agoo! And ye wyst how mery a lyfe Hyt is to be a wedded wyf, Ye wold chaunge that mynde. Ancilla Ye, so hyt is, as I understonde, If a woman have a gode husbondeâ But that ys herd to fynde! Many a man blamyth his wyf parde, And she is more to blame than he! B As true as the gospell now say ye, But now tell me one thing: Shall I have none other answere but this Of my desyre? Ancilla No syr, iwys, Not at this metyng. B Wyll ye now nede be agoo than? Take your leve honestly! Et conabitur eam osculari. Ancilla Se the man! Let me alone, with sorowe! B Mary, so be hyt. But one worde: I wyll kys the or thou goo. Ancilla The devyllis torde! The man is madde I trowe! B So madde I am that nedis I must As in this poynt have my lust How so ever I doo. Ancilla Parde, ye may do me that request, For why it is but good and honest. Et osculabitur. Intrat A. A Now a felychip, I the beseche, Set even suche a patche one my breche! B A wyld feyre therone! Ancilla Goddis mercy, this is he That I have sought so! A Have ye sought me? Ancilla Ye, that have I do! This gentylman can wytnes bere That all this owre I have stonde here Sechyng even for you. A Have ye two be togeder so longe? Ancilla Ye, why not? A Mary, then all is wrong I fere me so now. B Nay, nay, here be to many wytnes For to make ony syche besynes As thou wenest, hardely! Ancilla Why, what is the mannes thought? Suppose ye that I wolde be nowght Yf no man were by? [A] Nay, for God, y ment not so, But I wolde no man sholde have to do With you but onely I! Ancilla Have to do, quod a? What call ye that? Hyt sowndyth to a thing I wote ner what! [A] Ey, Godes mercy! I se well a man must be warre How he spekyth ther as ye arâ Ye take it so straungely! Nay, I mene nothyng but well, For by my wyll no man shall dele With you in way of maryage But onely Iâthis wyse I ment! Ancilla Ye, but though it were youre entent, Yet ye do but rage To use suche wordes unto me, For I am yet at my lyberte. A Ye, that I know well. But never the lesse, sythen I beganne To love you longe before this man, I have veray greate mervell That ever ye wolde his mynde fulfyll To stonde and talke with hym styll So long as ye have do. B Before me, quod a? Nay, I make avowe, I mevyde this matter long byfore you: How sey ye therto? Ancilla I wyll no thinge in the matter say Lest I cause you to make a fray, For thereof I wolde be lothe. A By cokkis body, butt who so ever it be That weddythe her bysydes me, I shall make hym wrothe! B Ye, but he that is so hasty at every worde, For a medsyn must ete his wyves torde! Ancilla Holde your tongis there I say, For and ye make this warke for me, Ye shall bothe dyspoyntyd be As fare as I may! A By my trouthe, but marke me well: Yf ever thou with this man dwell As a woman with here make, Thou shalt fynde hym the most froward man That ever thou sawiste sythe the worlde bygan! For I dare undertake That forty tymes on a day Withoute ony cause he wyll the afray And bete the bake and syde! Ancilla He shall not nede so to do, For he shall have forty causes and forty too Yf I with hym abyde. A Mary, that ys a remedy accordynge! But I can tell the an other thynge, And it is no lye: Thow maist well be hys weddyd wyf, But he wyll never love the in his lyf! Ancilla Yet I know a remedy. A Howso? Ancilla Mary, I wyll love hym as lytyll agayne! For every shrewed turne he shall have twayne And he were my brother. B Iwys, Jone, he spekythe but of males. There ys no man hens to Cales, Who so ever be the tother, That can hym selfe better applye To please a woman better then I. Ancilla Ye, so I harde you say! But yet, be ye never so wrothe, There ys never one of you bothe, For all youre wordes gay, That shalbe assured of me Tyll I may fyrst here and se What ye bothe can do. And he that can do most maystry, Be it in cokery or in pastry, In fettis of warre or dedys of chevalry, With hym wyll I go! A By my trowthe, that lykythe me well. Ther is no maystry that a man can tell But I am mete thereto, Wherefor that wagere I dare well undertake! Lett me se, wylt thou go coyt for thy ladis sake, Or what thyng shall we do? B Nay, yf thou wylt her with maystry wynne, With boyes game thou mayst not begynâ That is not her intent. A What is best that we do than? B Mary, canst thou syng? A Ye, that I can, As well as ony man in Kent. B What maner of song shall it be? A What so ever thou wylt chose the, I holde me well content. And yf I mete the not at the close, Hardely let me the wager lose By her owne jugement. Go to now, wyll ye set in? B Nay, be the rode, ye shall begyn. A By Seynt Jame, I assent. Abyde, Jone: ye can gode skyll, And if ye wolde the song fulfyll With a thyrd parte, It wolde do ryght well, in my mynde. Ancilla Synge on, hardely, and I wyll not be behynde, I pray the with all my hert. Et tunc cantabunt. B I am so whorse, it wyll not be. A Horse, quod a? Nay, so mot I the, That was not the thynge And a man sholde the trowth saye: Ye lost a crochet or two by the waye, To myne understondynge. B Why, was I a mynyme before? A Ye be the rode, that ye were and more. B Then were ye a mynyme behynde! Let me se, yet syng agayne, And marke whyche of us twayne Plesyth best your mynde. Ancilla Nay, nay, ye shall this matter try By some other maner of mastry Than by your syngynge. B Let hym assay what mastry he wull. A Mary, and my bely were not so full I wolde wrestell with hym a fayre pullâ That were a game accordynge For suche valyaunt men as we be! B I shrew thyn hert and thou spare me. Et deinde luctabuntur. [A is thrown.] Ancilla Nay, by my fayth, that was no fall! B A, than I se well ye be parcyall, Whan ye juge so. Well, I shall do more for your love! Evyn here I cast to hym my glove Or ever I hens goo, On the condycion that in the playne fylde I shall mete hym with spere and shelde My lyf theron to jeoparde. Let me se and he dare take hyt. Tunc projiciet cirothecam. A Yes hardely, I wyll not forsake hyt! I am not suche a coward But I dare mete the at all assaysâ Whan shall hyt be do? B Evyn streyght ways Withoute furthere delay, And I shrewe his hert that feris Eyther with cronall or sharpe speris This bargyn to assay. A And I beshrewe hym for me! But abyde, now let me se, Where shall I have a hors? B Nay, we shall nede no horse ne mule, But let us just at farte pryke in cule. A Be Seynt Jame, no forse, Evyn so be it! But where is oure gere? B By my fayth, all thing is redy [here] That belongethe therto. Com forthe, ye flowre of the frying pane, Helpe ye to aray us as well as ye can. And how so ever ye do, Se that ye juge indifferently Whiche of us twayne hathe the mastry. Ancilla Yes, hardely, that I shallâ I shall juge after my mynde. But see ye hold fast behynd Lest ye troble us in all. B Tushe, that is the lest care of fiftene. And yf I do not, on my game be yt sene! Go to, bynd me fyrst, hardely. So, lo, now, geve me my spere, And put me a staffe thorow hereâ Than am I all redy. A Abyde, who shall helpe to harnys me? Ancilla That shall I do, so mott I the, With a ryght gode wyll! A Soft and fayre! Myne arme is sore, Ye may not bynd me strayt ther fore. Ancilla Nay, no more I wyllâ I wyll not hurte the for twenty pounde. Come of now, syt downe on the grounde Evyn upon thy tayle. A Ey, gode Lorde, whan wyll ye have do? Ancilla Now all is redy: hardely, go to! Bydde hym bayle, bayle! A Fall to prayer, syrs, it is nede, As many of you as wolde me Gode spede, For this gere stondyth me uppon. B Ye, and that shall thou fynde or we departe, And yf thou spare me I shrow thy harte! Let me se, com on! Et projectus dicat A: A Out, out, alas for payne! Let me have a pryst or I be slayne My syn to dysclose. B And bycause he sayth so, it is nede, For he is not in clene lyfe in dede: I fele it at my noseâ Fo! Fo! etc. Now ye ar myne, lady! Ancilla Nay, never the more. B No? Why so? Ancilla For I am taken up before. B Mary, I beshrew your hart therefore! It shold better content me That ye had be taken up behynde. Ancilla Nay, nay, ye understond not my mynde In that poynt. B It may well be, But tell me, how ment ye then? Ancilla Mary, I am sure to an other man Whose wyfe I intende to be. B Nay, I trow, by cockis passyon, Ye wyll not mocke us of that fascyonâ Ye may not, for very shame! Ancilla Shame or not, so shall it be, And bycause that fore the love of me Ye two have made this game, It shall not be done all in vayne, For I wyll rewarde you bothe twayne, And ellis I were to blame. Somewhat thereby ye must nedis wyn, And therfore to everyche of you wyll I spyn A new peyre of breches! Take the that fore thy dole! And bycause he is blacke in the hole, He shall have as moche! Et utroque flagellato recedit Ancilla. A Oute, alas! What woman was this? B It is Lucres mayde. A The devyll it is! I pray God a vengeance take her! How saist thou, shall she be thy wyfe? B Nay, I had lever she had etyn my knyfe! I utterly forsake her. Intrat Gaius. Gayus How, syrs, who hath arayde you thys? A Fals thevys, maister, iwys, And all for your quarell! Gayus What? And this other man too? A Ye, and ye wolde oure hondes undo, The matter whe shall tell. Gayus Yes, mary, wyll I! Now tell on: Who hathe you these wrongis done? A Mary, that I shall. Cornelyus servantis, whiche is your enmy, Espyed me goyng toward Lucres place, That I coude brynge the matter to passe Of that gentyl[wo]man, as your desyre was. They leyd awayte for me in the way, And so they lefte me in this araye. Gayus Ye, but haste thou ony dedely wounde?â That is the thinge that feryth my mynde! A I faythe, I was lefte for dede on the grounde, And I have a grete garce here byhynde Out of the whiche ther commythe suche a wynde That yf ye holde a candyll therto Hyt wyll blowe it outeâthat wyll hyt do! Gayus Se to hyt be tyme, by myne advyse, Lest the wounde fewster within. A Then have I nede of a gode surgyn, For hyt is so depe within the skyn That ye may put youre nose therin Evyn up to the harde eyes. Here is a man that quyt hym as well For my defence as ever I see. He toke suche parte that in the quarell His arme was strykyne of by the harde kne, And yet he slew of them two or thre. Gayus Be they slayne? Nay, God forbyde! A Yes, so helpe me God, I warande them dede. How be it I stonde in grete drede That yf ever he come in theyr way They wyll kyt of his arme or his hede, For so I herde them all thre say. Gayus Whiche? Thay that were slayne? A Ye, by this day! What nedyth me therfore to lye? He herd it hym selfe as well as I. Gayus Well then, ye lye both two! [Exeat B.] But now tell me, what hast thou do As touchynge my commaundement That I badde the do to Lucres? Spakyst thou with her? A Ye, syr, dowtles, And this is her intent: Sche commaundyth hyr to you by the same tokyn That with hyr father she hath spokyn Accordynge to your requeste, And so she wyllythe you to be of gode chere, Desyrynge you this nyght to appere, Or tomorow at the furthest, And she wyll mete you here in this place To gyve you a fynall answare in this case Whereto ye shall trust. Gayus That is the thing that I desyre! But sayd she so? A Ye, be thys fyre, I tell you verey juste, In so moche that she bad me say And warne you that ye shulde purvay For your owne besenes, For than it shall determyde be Whether Publyus Cornelyus or ye Shall have the preemynence. Gayus All that purpose lykythe me well, But who shall be here more, canst thou tell? A Mary, here shall be Fulgens And Publius Cornelius hym selfe also, With dyverse other many moo Besyde this honorable audyence. Wherfore yf ye wyll youre honour save And your intent in this matter have, It is best that ye go hens For to study and call to mynde Suche argumentis as ye can best fynde And make your selfe all prest. Gayus Thy counsell is godeâbe it so, And evyn thereafter wyll I do, For I holde it best. Et exeat Gaius et A. Intrat B. B Goddes body, syr[s], this was a fytt! I beshrew the horys hart yett When I thinke theron, And yet the strokys be not so sore But the shame grevyth me more, Sith that it was done Before so many as here be present. But and I myght take her, By my trowth I shall make her This dede to repent! [Intrat A.] A Yet thou were as gode holde thy pease, For ther is no remedy doutlesâ Therfore lett itt go. It is to us bothe grete foly and shame This matter ony more to reherse or name. B Well than, be it so. And yet, because she hathe made me smart, I trust onys to ryde in her carte, Be it shame or no. I can not suffre it paciently To be rebuked openly And to be mockyd also! An other thing grevythe me werst of all: I shal be shent, that I shall, Of my mayster too Because I have ben so long away Oute of his presence. A Nay, nay, I have harde so muche syth I went hens That he had lityll mynd to thyn offens. B I pray you tell me why. A For as I brought my mayster on hys way I harde one of Lucres men say That thy mayster hathe ben All this houre at her place, And that he his answere hase, This wyse as I mene: She hathe appoynted hym to be here Sone, in the evynyng aboute suppere, An[d] than he shall have a fynall answere What she entendith to do. And so than we shal know here intent, For as I understond she wyll be content To have one of them too. But furst she wyll nedis know the certayn Whether is the most noble of them twayneâ This she sayeth alway. B Why, that is easy to understonde Yf she be so wyse as men bere in honde. A Ye, so I hard you say. Let me se now, what is your oppynion Whether of them is most noble of condycion? B That can I tell hardely: He that hathe moste nobles in store, Hym call I the most noble ever more, For he is most sett by. And I am sure Cornelyus is able With his owne goodis to bye a rable Of suche as Gayus is! And over that, yf noblenes of kynn May this womans favour wynn, I am sure he can not mys. A Ye, but come hether sone to the ynde of this playe And thou shalt se wherto all that wyll weyâ It shall be for thy lernynge. B Ye, cum agayne who wyll for me, For I wyll not be here, so mot I the! It is a gentylmanly thinge That I shulde awayt and com agayne For other mennys causes and take suche payne! I wyll not do it, I make God avowe. Why myght not this matter be endyd nowe? A Mary, I shall tell the why: Lucres and her father may not attende At this seson to make an endeâ So I hard them say. And also it is a curteyse gyse For to respyte the matter this wyse That the partyes may In the meane tyme advyse them well, For eyther of them bothe must tell And shew the best he can To force the goodnes of his owne condycion Bothe by example and gode reason. I wold not for a swan That thou sholdest be hens at that season, For thou shalt here a reyal disputacyon Bitwext them or thay have do. An other thing must be considred with all: These folke that sitt here in the halle May not attende theretoo: Whe may not with oure long play Lett them fro theyre dyner all dayâ Thay have not fully dyned. For and this play where ones overe past, Some of them wolde falle to fedyng as fast As thay had bene almost pyned. But no forse, hardely, and they do. Ussher, gete them goode wyne therto, Fyll them of the best. Let it be do or ye wyll be shent, For it is the wyll and commaundement Of the master of the fest. And therfore we shall the matter forbere And make a poynt evyn here Lest we excede a mesure, And we shall do oure labour and trewe entent For to play the remenant At my lordis pleasure. Finis prime partis.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[The Second Part] Intrat A dicens: A Muche gode do it you everycheoneâ Ye wyll not beleve how fast I have gone For fere that I sholde come to late! No forse, I have lost but a lytyll swete That I have taken upon this hete My colde corage to abate. But now to the matter that I cam fore: Ye know the cause therof beforeâ Your wittis be not so short. Perde, my felowys and I were here Today whan ye where at dyner, And shewed you a lytyll disport Of one Fulgens and his doughter Lucres, And of two men that made grett besynes Her husbonde for to be. She answered to them bothe than: Loke whiche was the more noble man, To hym she wolde agre. This was the substance of the play That was shewed here today, All be it that there was Dyvers toyes mengled yn the same To styre folke to myrthe and game And to do them solace, The whiche tryfyllis be impertinent To the matter principall, But never the lesse they be expedient For to satisfye and content Many a man with all. For some there be that lokis and gapys Only for suche tryfles and japys, And some there be amonge That forceth lytyll of suche madnes, But delytyth them in matter of sadnes Be it never so longe. And every man must have hys mynde, Ellis thay will many fautys fynde And say the play was nought. But no force, I car not, Let them say and spare not, For God knoweth my thought. It is the mynde and intent Of me and my company to content The leste that stondyth here, And so I trust ye wyll it alowe. Ey, Godis mercy, where am I now? It were almys to wrynge me by the eare Bycause I make suche degression From the matter that I began Whan I entred the halle. For had I made a gode contynuaunce, I sholde have put you in remembraunce And to your myndis call How Lucres wyll come hyder agayne, And her sayde lovers bothe twayne, To dyffyne thys question: Whether of them ys the more noble man. For theron all this matter began: It is the chefe foundacyon Of all thys proces both all and some, And yf thes players were ons come, Of this matter will they speke. I mervell gretely in my mynde That thay tary so long behynde Theyre howre for to breke. But what, syrs! I pray you everychone Have pacyens, for thay come anone. I am sure they wyll not fayle But thay wyll mete in this place As theyre promys and apoyntment wase, And ellis I have merveyle. Let me se, what is now a-cloke? [Knocking at the door.] A, there commyth oneâI here hym knoke. He knokythe as he were wood! One of you go loke who it is. [Intrat B.] B Nay, nay, all the meyny of them iwis Can not so moche gode. A man may rappe tyll his naylis ake Or ony of them wyll the labour take To gyve hym an answere. A I have grete marvell on the That ever thou wylt take upon the To chyde ony man here! No man is so moche to blame as thow For longe taryinge. B Ye, God avow, Wyll ye play me that? Mary, that shall be amended anone: I am late comen and I wyll sone be gone, Ellis I shrew my catt. Kockis body, syr, it is a fayre resone. I am com hedyr att this season Only at thy byddynge, And now thou makyst to me a quarell As though all the matter were in parell By my longe taryynge. Now God be with you, so mote I the, Ye shall play the knave alone for me! [B offers to leave.] A What? I am afrayde, Iwis, ye are but lewyde! Turne agayne, all beshrewydeâ Now are you fayre prayde! B Why than, is your angyr all do? A Ye, mary, is it, lo. B So is myne tooâ I have done clene. But now how goyth this matter forth Of this mariage? A By Saynt Jame, ryght nought worth. I wot nere what thay meane, For I can none other wise thinke But that some of them begyn to shrinke Bycause of ther longe tariage. B Shrynke now, quod a? Mary, that were mervele. But one thinge of surete I can the tell As touchynge this mariage: Cornelius my mayster apoyntyth hym therupone, And dowtles he wyll be here anone, In payne of forty pens, In so muche that he hath devysyde Certayne straungers fresshly disgisyd Att his owne exspens For to be here this nyght also. A Straungers, quod a? What to do? B Mary, for to glade with all This gentylwoman at her hedyr comynge. A A, then I se well we shall have a mummynge! B Ye, surely, that we shall! And therfor never thinke it in thy mynde That my mayster wyll be behynde Nor slacke at this bargyn. Mary, here he commyth, I have hym aspyde. No more wordis, stonde thou asyde, For it is he playne. [A goes out. Cornelius enters in the costume of a gallant.] Cornelius My frynde, where abowt goist thou all day? B Mary syr, I came heder to asay Whedyr these folke had ben here. And yet thay be not come, So helpe me God and holydomeâ Of that I have moche marvaile, That thay tary so. Cornelius Mary, go thi way And wit where thay wyll or no! B Ye, God avow, shall I so. Cornelius Ye, mary, so I say. B Yet in that poynt, as semyth me, Ye do not accordynge to your degre. Cornelius I pray the, tell me why? B Mary, it wolde becom them well inow To be here afore and to wayte upon you, And not you to tary For theyr laysyr and abyde them here As it were one that were ledde by the eareâ For that I defy! By this mene you sholde be theyr druge, I tell you trought, I. And yet the worst that greveth me Is that your adversary sholde in you se So notable a folyâ Therfore wit[h]draw you for a seasone. Cornelius By Seynt Johan, thou sayst but reasone. B Ye, do so hardely, And whan the tyme drawith upon That thay be com everychone And all thinge redy, Than shall I come streyght away For to seche you withoute delay. Cornelius Be it so, hardely. But one thinge whyle I thinke therone, Remember this when I am gone: Yef hit happon so That Lucres come in fyrst alone, Go in hand with her anone, How so ever thou do, For to fele her mynde toward me, And by all meanis possyble to be, Induce her therunto. B Than some token you must gyve me, For ellis she wyll not beleve me That I cam from you. Cornelius Mary, that is evyn wysely spoken. Commaunde me to her by the same tokenâ She knowyth it well inowâ That as she and I walkyde onis togedyr In her garden hedyr and thedyr, There happonde a straunge case. For at the last we dyd se A byrd sittynge on a holow treâ An ashe I trow it was. Anone she prayde me for to assay Yf I coude start the byrde away. B And dyde ye so? Alas, alas! Cornelius Why the devyll sayst thou so? B By cokkis bonis, for it was a kocko! And men say amonge, He that throwyth stone or stycke At suche a byrde, he is lycke To synge that byrdes songe. Cornelius What the devyll recke I therfore? Here what I say to the ever more, And marke thine erand well: Syr, I had no stone to throw with all, And therfore she toke me her musc ball, And thus it befell: I kyst it as strayght as ony pole, So that it lyghtyde evyn in the hole Of the holow ashe. Now, canst thou remember all this? B By God, I wolde be loth to do amys, For some tyme I am full rashe. Ye say that ye kyst it evyn in the hole Of the holow ashe as strayte as a poleâ Sayde ye not so? Cornelius Yes. B Well then, let me alone. As for this erande, it shall be done As sone as ye be go. Cornelius Fare well then, I leve the here, And remembyr well all this gere How so ever thou do. Et exeat Cornelius. B Yes hardely, this erande shall be spoken. But how say you, syrs, by this tokene? Is it not a quaynt thinge? I went he hade bene a sad man, But I se well he is a made man In this message doynge. But what? Chose he for me, I am but as a messanger perdeâ The blame shall not be myne but his, For I wyll his token reporte Whether she take it in ernest or sporteâ I wyll not therof mys. Be she wroth or well apayde, I wyll tell her evyn as he sayde. Intrat Lucres. God avow, here she is! It is tyme for me to be wyse. Now welcome lady, floure of prise: I have sought you twyse or thryse Wythin this houre iwys. Lucres Me syr? Have ye sought me? B Ye, that I have by God that bowght me. Lucres To what intent? B Mary, for I have thingis a few The which I must to you shew By my maysters commaundement. Publius Cornelius is hys name, Your veray lover, in payne of shame, And yf ye love hym not ye be to blame! For this dare I say, And on a boke make it gode: He lovyd you better than his one hart blode. Lucres Hys harde bloode? Nay, nay, Half that love wolde serve for me! B Yet sithe he dyde you fyrst se In the place where he dwellis, He had lovyd you so in hys hart That he settyth not by hym self a fart, Nor by noo man ellis. And bycause ye shulde gyve credence Unto my sayng in hys absence And trust to that I say, He tolde me tokyns two or thre Whiche I know well as he tolde me. Lucres Tokyns? What be thay? B Let me seânow I had nede to be wyse, For one of his tokyns is very nyse As ever I harde tell! He prayd you for to beleve me By the same tokyn that ye and he Walkyd togeder by a holow tre. Lucres All that I know well. B A, than I am yet in the ryght way. But I have som other thyng to say Towchyng my credence Whiche as I thynke were best to be spared, For happely ye wold not have it declared Byfore all this audience. Lucres Nay, nay, hardely, spare not: As for my dedis, I care not Yf all the worlde it harde. B Mary, than shall I procede. He shewde me also in very dede How ther satt a byrde, And than ye delyveryd hym your muskball For to throw at the byrd with all, And than as he sayd, ye dyd no wors But evyn fayr kyst hym on the noke of the ars. Lucres Nay, ther thow lyest falsely, by my fay! B Trouth, it was on the hole of thars I shulde sayâ I wyst well it was one of the too, The noke or the hole. Lucres Nay, nor yet so! B By my fayth, ye kyst hym or he kyst you On the hole of thars, chose you nowâ This he tolde me sure. How be it, I speke it not in reprove, For it was done but for gode love And for no synfull pleasure. Lucres Nay, nay, man, thow art farr amys! I know what thyn erande is, Though thow be neclygent. Of thy foly thou mayst well abasshe, For thou shuldis have sayde the holow asshe: That hole thy mayster ment. B By God avow, I trow it was! I crye you mercy, I have done you trespas. But I pray you take it in pacyence, For I mystoke it by necligence. A myscheef com theron! He myght have sent you this gere in a letter! But I shall go lerne myn erande better, And cum ayen anon. Et exeat. Lucres Ye, so do hardely! Now forsoth, this was a lewed message As ever I harde sith I was bore. And yf his mayster have therof knowlege He wyll be angry with hym therfore. How be it, I will speke therof no more, For hyt hath ben my condiscyon alwey No man to hender but to helpe where I may. Intrat A. A Feyr maysters, lyketh it you to know That my mayster commaunde me to you! Lucres Commaundeth you to me? A Nay, commaundeth you to hym! Lucres Wele amendyd, by Saynt Sym. A Commaundeth he to you, I wolde say, Or ellis you to heânow chose ye may Whether lyketh you better! And here he sendyth you a letter. Godis mercy, I had it ryght now! Syrs, is there none there among you That toke up suche a wrytyng? I pray you, syrs, let me have it agayne! Lucres Ye ar a gode messanger for certeyne! But I pray you, syr, of one thyng: Who is your mayster?âtell me that! A Maister what call ye hym! Parde, ye wott Whome I mene well and fyne! Lucres Yet I know not, so mot I go! A What? Yes, parde, he that wolde have you so. Lucres I suppose there be many of tho Yf I wolde enclyne! But yet know I not who ye mene. I holde best that ye go ageyene To lerne your maysters name. A By my fayth, and I holde it best. Ye may say I am a homely gest In ernest and in game. Lucres Abyde, I shall go to you nerehonde: What ys your owne name, I wolde understonde? Tell me that or I go! I trow thou canst not well tell. A By my fayth, not verely well, Bycause ye say so. Et scalpens caput post modicum intervallum dicat: By this lyght, I have forgoten! How be it, by that tyme I have spoken With som of my company, I shall be acerteyned of this gere. But shall I fynde you agayne here? Lucres Ye, that thow shalt, happely! Et exeat A. [Et intrat Cornelius.] Cornelius Now fayr Lucres, accordyng to thappoyntement That ye made with me here this day, Bycause ye shall not fynde me there neclygent, Here I am come your wyll to obey, And redy am I for my selfe to sey That, as towchyng the degre of noble condycion, Betwyxt me and Gayus there may be no comparison. And that shall I shew you by apparent reason Yf it shall lyke you that I now begynne. Lucres Nay, ye shall spare it for a lytyll season Tyl suche tyme that Gayus your adversary come in, For I wyll gyve you therin none audience Tyll ye be both toge[d]er in presence. And in ony wyse, kepe well your patience Lyke as I have bound you both to the peace. I forbyde you utterly all maner of violence Durynge this matter, and also that ye seace Of all suche wordis as may gyve occasion Of brallynge or other ongodely condycion. Cornelius There shal be in me no suche abusyon In worde nor dede, I you promyse. [Intrat B.] But now let me se: what occupation Or what maner of passe tyme wyll ye devyse Whyle that these folke dothe tary this wyse? Wyll ye see a bace daunce after the gyse Of Spayne whyle ye have no thynge to do? All thynge have I purvaide that belongyth therto! Lucres Syr, I shall gyve you the lokynge on. Cornelius Wyll ye do so? I aske no more. Go sone and bidde them come thens anone, And cause the mynystrellis to come in beffore. [B fetches the minstrels.] B Mary, as for one of them, his lippe is soreâ I trow he may not pype, he is so syke. Spele up tamboryne, ik bide owe frelike! [The dancers come in.] Et deinde corisabunt. Lucres Forsothe, this was a godely recreacyon. But I pray you, of what maner nation Be these godely creatours? Were they of Englonde or of Wales? B Nay, they be wylde Irissh Portyngales That dyde all these pleasures. How be it, it was for my maysters sake, And he wyll deserve it, I undertake, On the largest wyse. Cornelius Go thy selfeâwhy stondis thou so?â And make them chere! Let it be do The best thou canst devyse. B Yes, they shall have chere hevyn hye! But one thing I promyse you faithfullyâ They get no drynke therto. Exeat [with dancers and minstrels. Gayus comes in.] Dicat Lucres: Lucres Lo, here thys man ys come nowâ Now may ye in your matter procede. Ye remembre both what I sayde to you Touchynge myne answereâI trow it is no nede Ony more to reherse it. Cornelius No, in veray dede, For moche rehersall wolde let the spede Of all this matterâit nedyth no more. Let us roundely to the matter we come for. Lucres Ye, that I pray you as hartly as I can. But fyrst me semyth it were expedient That ye both name some indifferent man For to gyve betwyxt you the forseyde jugement. Cornelius Nay, as for that, by myne assent, No man shall have that office but ye. Gayus And I holde me well content that it so be. Lucres Ye, but not wythstondyng that ye therto agre That I sholde this question of nobles diffine, It is a grete matter whiche, as semyth me, Pertayneth to a philosopher or ellis a devyne. How be it, sith the choyse of this matter is myne, I can be content, under certayne protestacyon, Whan that I have harde you, to say myne opinion. Lo, this wyse I mene and thus I do intende: That what so ever sentence I gyve betwyxt you two After myne owne fantasie, it shall not extende To ony other person. I wyll that it be so, For why no man ellis hath theryn ado. It may not be notyde for a generall precedent, All be it that for your partis ye do therto assent. Gayus As touchyng that poynt we holde us well contentâ Your sentence shall touche no man but us twayne. And sith ye shall gyve it by our owne agrement, None other man ought to have thereat disdayne. Wherfor all thys dout ye may well refrayne, And in that matter principall this tyme wolde be spent. Cornelius Than wyll I begynne. Gayus I holde me well content. Cornelius Syth ye have promysed, fayre Lucres, heretofore That to the more noble man ye wyll enclyne, Vary not fro that worde and I aske no more, For than shall the victory of this cause be myne, As it shalbe easy to jugge and diffyne. For every creature that ony reason hase Me semyth I durst make hym self jugge in this case, Save that I fere me the beaute of your face Sholde therin blynde hym so that he ne myght Egally disserne the wronge fro the right. And if he were half so wyse a man in dede As he reputeth hym self for to be, Upon your saide answere he sholde not nede To gaynesay in this matter or travers with me. My noblenes is knowen thorow all the cyteâ He knoweth hym selfe the noblenes of my kynâ And at that one poynt my proces I wyll begyne. Amonge all thistoryes of Romaynes that ye rede, Where fynde ye ony blode of so gret noblenes As hath ben the Cornelys wherof I am brede? And if so be that I wolde therin holde my pease, Yet all your cornecles beryth gode witnes That my progenytours and auncetours have be The chefe ayde and diffence of this noble cyte. How ofte have myne auncetours in tymes of necessite Delyverd this cyte from dedely parell As well by theyr manhode as by theyr police? What jeopardi and paine they have suffred in the quarell Thempire to encrece and for the comune wele It nedith not the specialties to reherse or name Sith every trew Romaine knoweth the same. In every mannys howse that histories be rife And wrytten in bookis, as in some placis be The gestis of Arthur, or of Alexandyrs life, In the whiche stories ye may evidently se And rede how Cartage, that royall cyte, By Cipion of Affrick, my grete graunte-sire, Subduede was and also ascribede to his empire. And many other cyties that dyde conspire Ayenst the noble senatoure makynge resistence, As often as necessite did it require They were reducyd unto due obedience Eyther by the policy or by the violence Of my sayde aunceters: thistories be playne And witnesse that I speke not these wordis in vayne. My blode hath ever takyn suche payne To salve garde the comune wele fro ruyn and decay, That by one advyse the Cenat dyde ordeyne Them to be namyd the faders of the contray, And so were myne auctours reputed alway, For in every nede they dyde upon them call For helpe as the chylde doth on the fader naturall. How be it, to praye them it was no nede at all, For of their owne myndis they were redy alway. In tokyn of the same, for a memoriall Of theyr desertis the cytie dyde edifye Triumphall arches, wheruppon ye may To my grete honour se at this day Thymages of myn auncetours evyn by and by Bycause that theyr noblenes sholde never dye. In token also that they were worthy Grete honour and prayse of all the contray, It is commaunded and used generally That every cytezen that passith that way By the sayde images, he must obey And to that fygures make a due reverence, And ellis to the lawes he dothe grete offence. Sith it is so than that of convenience Suche honoure and homage must nedis be do To these dede ymagis, than muche more reverence To me sholde be gevynâI trow ye thinke soâ, For I am theyr very ymage and relyque to Of theyr flesch and blode, and veray inherytoure As well of theyr godes as of theyr sayde honoure. To me they have left many a castell and toure Whiche in theyr triumphes thay rightfully wan. To me they have also left all theyr tresoure In suche abundaunce that I trow no man Within all Rome, sith it fyrst began, Had half the store as I understonde That I have evyn now at ons in my honde. Lo, in these thyngis my noblenes doth stonde, Whiche in myne oppynyon suffiseth for this intent. And I trow there is no man throwgh all this londe Of Italy, but if he were here present He wolde to my sayng in this matter assent And gyve unto me the honoure and preeminence Rather than make agayne me resistence. I marvayle gretly what shulde thy mynde insence To thinke that thy tytle therin sholde be gode! Parde, thow canst not say for thy deffence That ever there was gentilman of thy kyn or blode! And if there were oone, it wolde be understode Without it be thy self, whiche now of late Among noble gentylmen playest check mate. Lucres No more therof, I pray you! Suche wordis I hate, And I dyde forbid you them at the begynnyng To eschue thoccasyon of stryfe and debate. Gayus Nay, let hym aloneâhe spekyth after his lernyng! For I shall answer hym to every thyng Whan he hath all said, if ye woll here me, As I thinke ye wyll of your equyte. Cornelius Abide, I must make an ende fyrst, parde. To you, swete Lucres, I wolde have said beffore That yf ye wyll to my desyre in this matter agre, Doubtles ye shall blesse the tyme that ever ye were bore, For riches shall ye have at your will ever more Without care or study of laboriouse besynes, And spend all your dayes in ease and plesaunt idelnesse. About your owne apparell ye can do non excesse In my company that sholde displese my mynd. With me shall ye do non other maner of besynes But hunt for your solace at the hart and hynde, And some tyme where we convenient game fynde Oure hawkis shal be redy to shew you a flight Whiche shal be right plesaunt and chereful to your sight. And yf so be that in huntyng ye have no delyght, Than may ye daunce a whyle for your disport. Ye shall have at your pleasure both day and night All maner of mynstralsy to do you comfort. Do what thyng ye wyll, I have to support Our chargis, and over that I may susteyne At myne owne fyndyng an hundred or twayne. And as for hym, I am certayn Hys auncetours were of full poore degre, All be it that now withyn a yere or twayne, Bycause that he wold a gentilman be, He hath hym goten both office and fee, Whiche after the rate of hys wrechyd sparyng Suffiseth scarsely for hys bare lyvynge. Wherfore swete Lucres, it were not accordyng For your grete beaute with hym to dwell, For there sholde ye have a threde bare lyvynge With wrechyd scarcenes, and I have herde tell That maydens of your age love not ryght well Suche maner of husbondis, without it be thay That forceth lytyll to cast them self away. I mene specyally for suche of them as may Spede better if they wyll, as ye be yn the case. And therfore Lucres, what so ever he wyll say Hys title agaynst you to force and embrace, Ye shall do your owen selfe to grete a trespas Yf ye folow hys part and enclyne therto. Now say what ye wyll, syr, for I have all doo. Gayus With ryght gode will I shall go to, So that ye will here me with as grete pacience As I have harde youâreason wolde soo. And what so ever I shall speke in this audience, Eyther of myn owne meritis or of hys insolence, Yet fyrst unto you all, syrs, I make this request: That it wolde lyke you to construe it to the best. For lothe wolde I be as ony creature To boste of myne owne dedisâit was never my gyse. On that other syde, loth I am to make ony reportur Of this mans foly or hym to dispice. But never the lesse this matter towchith me in suche wise That what so ever ye thinke in me, I must procede Unto the veray trouth therof as the matter is in dede. To make a grete rehersall of that ye have saide The tyme will not suffre, but never the lesse Two thingis for your self in substaunce ye have layd Whiche as ye suppose maketh for your nobles, Upon the whiche thingis dependith all your processe: Fyrst, of your auncetours ye allege the noble gestis; Secondly, the substaunce that ye have of theyr bequestis. In the whiche thingis onely, by your owne confession, Standeth all your noblenesâthis sayd ye beffore. Whereunto this I say under the correction Of Lucres oure jugge here, that ye ar never the more Worthy in myne oppynion to be callyd noble therfore, And withoute ye have better causes to shew than these, Of reason ye must the victory of this matter lese. To the fyrst parte as touching your auncetours dedis, Some of them were noble lyke as ye declareâ Thestoris bereth witnes, I must graunt them nedis. But yet for all that, some of them ware Of contrary di[s]posycion like as ye are, For they dyde no proffiteâno more do yeâ To the comon wele of this noble cytie. Yf ye wyll the title of noblenes wynne, Shew what have ye done your self therfore. Some of your owne meritis let se bryng in, Yf ever ye dyde ony syth ye were bore. But surely ye have no suche thyng in store Of your owne meritis wherby of right Ye shulde appere noble to ony mannys sight. But neverthelesse I wyll you not blame Thowgh ye speke not of your owne dedis at all. And to say the trowght, ye may not for shame: Your lyfe is so voluptuouse and so bestiall In folowynge of every lust sensuall That I marvaille no thynge in my mynde Yf ye leve your owne dedis behynde. He wenyth that by hys proude contenaunce Of worde and dede, with nyse aray, Hys grete othys, and open mayntenaunce Of theftis and murdres every day, Also hys ryotouse disportis and play, Hys sloth, his cowardy, and other excesse, Hys mynde disposed to all unclennesseâ But these thyngis oonly he shall have noblenesse. Nay, the title of noblenes wyll not ensue A man that is all gevyn to suche insolence, But it groweth of longe continued vertu, As I trust, lady, that youre indifference Can well diffyne by your sentence. Hys auncetours were not of suche condicion, But all contrary to hys disposicyon. And therfore they were noble withouten faile, And dyde grete honoure to all the contrey. But what can theyr sayde noblenes advayle To hym that takyth a contrary way?â Of whome men spekith every day So grete dishonoure, that it is marvel The contrey suffereth hym therin to dwelle. And where he to-wyteth me of pore kyn, He doth me therin a wrongfull offence. For no man shall thankis or praysyng wyn By the gyftis that he hath of natures influence. Lyke wyse I thinke by a contrary sense That if a man be borne blynde or lame, Not he hym selfe but nature therin is to blame. Therfor he doth not me therin repreve. And as for that poynt, this I wott welle, That both he and I cam of Adam and Eve. There is no difference that I can tell Whiche makith oon man an other to excell So moche as doth vertue and godely maner, And therin I may well with hym compare. How be it, I speke it not for myne one prayse, But certeynly this hath ever be my condicion: I have borne unto God all my daies His laude and prayse with my due devocion, And next that I bere allwayes To all my neyghbours charitable affeccyon. Incontynency and onclennes I have had in abhominacion, Lovyng to my frende and faythfull with all, And ever I have withstonde my lustis sensuall. One tyme with study my tyme I spende To eschew idelnes, the causer of syn. An other tyme my contrey manly I deffend, And for the victoryes that I have done therin, Ye have sene your selfe, syr, that I have come in To this noble cytee twyse or thryse Crownyd with lawryel as it is the gyse. By these wayes, lo, I do aryse Unto grete honoure fro low degre, And yf myn heires will do likewyse Thay shal be brought to nobles by me. But Cornely, it semyth by the That the nobles of thyn auncetours everycheon Shall utterly starve and die in the alone. And where he to-witeth me on that other syde Of small possession and grete scarcenes, For all that, lady, if ye will with me abidde I shall assure you of moderate richesse, And that sufficient for us both doutles. Ye shall have also a man accordyng To youre owne condicions in every thing. Now Lucres, I have shewyd unto you a parte Of my title that I clayme you by, Besechynge you therfore with all my hart To considre us both twayne indifferently, Whiche of us twayne ye will rather alow More worthy for nobles to marry with you. Lucres Syrs, I have hard you both at large. Cornelius Nay, abide Lucres, I pray you hertly! Sithe he leyeth many thynges to my charge, Suffre that I may therunto repply. Lucres Iwis, replication shall not be necessary Withoute that ye have some other thing in store To shew for your self than ye dyde beffore. Cornelius Why lady, what thing will ye desyre more Than I have shewyd to make for noblenes? Lucres Yes, som thyng ther ys that makyth therfore Better than ye have shewid in your processe. But now let me se what man of witnes Or what other proves will ye forth bryng By the whiche eyther of you may justifie his sayng? Gayus As for my parte, I wyll stonde gladly To the commune voyce of all the contrey. Lucres And ye lyke wyse syr? Cornelius Ye certaynly, I shall in no wyse your worde dissobey. Lucres Than wyll I betwyxt you both take this way: I shall go enquyre as faste as I may What the commune fame wyll theryn reporte, And whan I have therof a due evidence, Than shall I agayne to you resorte To shew you thopynyon of my sentence Whome I wyll jugge to have the preemynence. Cornelius Nay, fayre Lucres, I you requyre: Let me not now depart in vayne Not knowyng theffect of my desyre. Lucres Syr, allthough it be to you a payne, Yet must ye do so evyn both twayne. Eche of you depart hens to hys owne place, And take no more labour or payne in this case. For as towchyng theffect of my sentence, I shall go write it by gode advysement Sone after that I am departed fro hens. And than to eyther of you both shalbe sent A copy of the same, to this intent: That of none other person it shall be sayn Sith it concerneth but onely unto you twayne. Gayus This is a gode waye as in my mynde. Ar not ye, syr, content in lyke wyse? Cornelius I wot nere, yet I wyll prayse as I fynde And as I have causeâthat is evyr my gyse. Gayus Well Lucres, will ye commaunde me ony servyce? Lucres No servyce at all, syr. Why say ye so? Our Lorde spede you both where so ever ye goo. Et exeant Publius Cornel[i]us et Gaius Flaminius [et A]. Now som mayde, happely, and she were in my case, Wolde not take that way that I do intend, For I am fully determyned with Godis grace So that to Gaius I wyll condyscend, For in this case I do hym commend As the more noble man, sith he thys wyse By meane of hys vertue to honoure doth aryse. And for all that, I wyll not dispise The blode of CorneliusâI pray you thinke not so! God forbede that ye sholde note me that wyse, For truely I shall honoure them where so ever I go, And all other that be of lyke blode also. But unto the blode I wyll have lytyl respect Where the condicyons be synfull and abject. I pray you all, syrs, as meny as be here: Take not my wordis by a sinistre way. [Intrat B.] B Yes, by my trouth, I shall witnes bere, Where so ever I be com a nother day, How suche a gentylwoman did opynly say That by a chorles son she wolde set more Than she wolde do by a gentylman bore. Lucres Nay, syr, than ye report me amys! B I pray you tell me, how sayd ye than? Lucres For God syr, the substaunce of my wordis was this: I say evyn as I saide whan I began, That for vertue excellent I will honoure a man Rather than for hys blode, if it so fall That gentil condicyons agre not with all. B Than I put case that a gentilman bore Have godely maners to his birth accordyng. Lucres I say, of hym is to be set gret store: Suche one is worthy more lawde and praysyng Than many of them that hath their begynnyng Of low kynred, ellis God forbede!â I wyll not afferme the contrary for my hede, For in that case ther may be no comparyson! But never the lesse I said this before, That a man of excellent vertuouse condicions, Allthough he be of a pore stoke bore, Yet I wyll honour and commende hym more Than one that is descendide of ryght noble kyn Whose lyffe is all dissolute and rotyde in syn. And therfore I have determyned utterly That Gaius Flaminius shall have his intent. To hym onely I shall my self apply To use me in wedloke at his commaundement, So that to Cornelyus I wyll never assent Allthough he had as grete possession As ony one man in Cristen region. I shall in no wyse favour or love hys condicyon, How be it that his blode requyreth due reverence, And that shall I gyve hym with all submyssionâ But yet shall he never have the preemynence To speke of very nobles by my sentence. Ye be hys servaunt syrâgo your way And report to your mayster evyn as I say. [Exeat Lucres.] B Shall I do that erand? Nay, let be! By the rode, ye shall do it your selfe for me. I promyse you faythfully, I wolde my mayster had be in Scotland Whan he dyd put this matter in her hand To stond to her jugement! But forasmoche as it is so That this wrong to hym is doo By a woman, he must let it goo And holde hym content. But he is of suche disposycion That whan he hereth of this conclusion He wylbe starke maddâ Ye, by my trowth, as made as an hare! It shall make hym so full of care That he wyll with hym self fare Evyn as it were a lade! And so wold not I, so mote I thee! For this matter, and I were as he, It shulde never anger me, But this wold I do: I wolde let her go in the mare name! [Intrat A.] A What now, syrs, how goth the game? What, is this woman go? B Ye, ye, man! A And what way hathe she takyn? B By my fayth, my mayster is forsakyn, And nedis she wyll agre Unto thy maysterâthus she saieth, And many causes therfore she leyeth Why it shulde so be. A I marvayle gretely wherof that grue. B By my fayth, she saideâI tell the trueâ That she wolde nedis have hym for his vertue And for none other thynge. A Vertue? What the devyll is that? And I can tell, I shrew my catt, To myne understondynge! B By my fayth, no more can I. But this she said here opynlyâ All these folke can tell. A How say ye, gode women? Is it your gyse To chose all your husbondis that wyse? By my trought, than I marvaile! B Nay, this is the fere, so mot I goo: T[h]at men chise not theyr wyffis so In placis where I have be. For wiffis may well complayne and grone, Albe it that cause have they none That I can here or se. But of weddyd men there be ryght fewe That welle not say the best is a shrewâ Therin they all agree! I warne you weddyd men everichone That other remede have ye none So moche for your ease, And ye wold study tyll tomorow, But let them evyn aloneâwith sorow!â Whan they do you displease. A Tusshe, here is no man that settyth a blank By thy consell or konneth the thankâ Speke therof no more! They know that remedy better than thow. But what shall we twayne do now? I care most therforeâ Me thinketh that matter wolde be wist. B Mary, we may goo hens whan we lystâ No man saith us nay. A Why than, is the play all do? B Ye, by my feyth, and we were ons go It were do streght wey. A And I wolde have thought in vere dede That this matter sholde have procede To som other conclusion! B Ye, thou art a maister mery man!â Thou shall be wyse I wot nere whan. Is not the question Of noblenes now fully defynde As it may be so by a womans mynde? What woldyst thow have more? Thow toldest me that other day That all the substaunce of this play Was done specially therfor Not onely to make folke myrth and game, But that suche as be gentilmen of name May be somwhat movyd By this example for to eschew The wey of vyce and favour vertue; For syn is to be reprovyd More in them, for the degre, Than in other parsons such as be Of pour kyn and birth. This was the cause principall, And also for to do with all This company some myrth. And though the matter that we have playde Be not percase so wele conveyde And with so gret reason As thistory it self requyreth, Yet the auctour therof desyrith That for this season At the lest ye will take it in pacience. And yf ther be ony offence (Show us wherein or we go hence) Done in the same, It is onely for lacke of connynge, And not he but his wit runnynge Is thereof to blame. And glade wolde he be and ryght fayne That some man of stabyll brayne Wolde take on hym the labour and payne This mater to amendeâ And so he wyllyd me for to say. And that done, of all this play Shortely here we make an end. EMPRYNTED AT LONDON BY JOHAN RASTELL DWELLYNGE ON THE SOUTH SYDE OF PAULYS CHYRCHE BYSYDE PAULYS CHEYNE.</field>
