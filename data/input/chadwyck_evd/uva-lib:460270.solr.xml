      <field name="fulltext">RICHES: OR, THE WIFE AND BROTHER, a Play, IN FIVE ACTS, FOUNDED ON MASSINGER'S COMEDY OF THE CITY MADAM.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The City Madam of Massinger, like most other plays of the same period, presents so strange a mixture of good and bad writing, of exalted sentiment and gross obscenity, that it is less surprising it should have been so long banished from the stage, than that its representation should ever have been suffered. Nor was its contexture better than its morals; its plot was extravagant and improbable, its characters were ill supported, and any interest, which might have been created in the course of the drama, was effectually stifled by the absurdity of its conclusion. To alter or adapt such a comedy for a modern audience was impossible; but to suffer the beauties which it contained to remain concealed in the impure mass which enveloped them, was unjust alike to the fame of Massinger, and to the good taste of our own time. The only way, by which they could be properly brought forward was that which has now been adopted; by writing a new play, in which might be incorporated those passages of the City Madam, which were considered as deserving of preservation. It remains for the reader, by comparison of this play with its prototype, to decide on the difficulty of the undertaking, as well as on the manner in which it has been executed. I have only to express by thanks to the public, for the indulgence with which it was received âto Mr. Arnold, the manager of the Lyceum Theatre, for having brought it forward with such advantage, and to the several performers, especially Mrs. Edwin, and Mr. Raymond, to whose talents and zeal I am sensible much of the applause bestowed upon it must be attributed. J. B. BURGES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Written by Sir James Bland Burges, AND SPOKEN BY MR. EYRE. 'Mid the wide ruins of imperial Rome, The cradle once of genius, now the tomb, If chance a sculptur'd fragment should disclose, Some Jove or PhÅbus without arms or nose, With emulation rival artists strive It's shape and just proportions to revive, 'Till when restor'd its symmetry and grace, With added beauties both of form and face, In the completed mass the critic sees The band of Phideas or Praxiteles. So, 'mid our British stores neglected lie Dramas, which might the touch of time defy, But that the taint of a licencious age Forbids them to disgrace our purer stage. Our ancestors thro' five long acts could sit, Mistaking gross indecency for wit, And even females, 'neath a vizor's shade, Intrepidly the shameless stage survey'd. More pure the manners now, more chaste the treat At which the muse invites you now to meet; Whether at folly or at vice she fly, This praise is her's, she flies with decency. High 'mongst the bards once better known to same Still stands recorded Massinger's proud name, Who close to Shakespeare's matchless genius soar'd, Who, next to Jonson, from true learning's hoard With skilful hand his rich materials drew, To manners faithful, and to nature true, Yet who with grossness so debas'd his verse, What he dar'd write we dare not now rehearse. Still, since replete his lines with vig'rous thought, Since glows the fire from inspiration caught, Let us, on his behalf, your favour pray, While from oblivion's gulph we snatch this play. Clear'd from the dross which it's pure ore debas'd, The fault of fashion, or the lapse of haste, It's rank growth prun'd with no unsparing hand, It's morals mended, and it's scenes new plann'd, It trusts to you it's renovated cause, And waits your verdict,âcensure or applause.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Sir John Traffic's Counting-House. Enter Invoice and Ledger. Ledger. The ship is safe i'th' pool then? Invoice. And makes good In her rich freight the name she bears, the Speedwell. Our master, Sir John Traffic, never made A braver speculation. On my knowledge, Who sailing in her can pronounce her value, For ev'ry hundred that he ventur'd in her, She hath return'd him five. Ledger. Would it were mine, Or but a tythe on't!âWell, our master needs Supplies like this; his out-goings are great. Invoice. Why, truly, things seem chang'd. This gorgeous mansion, The hangings and the furniture o' th' chambers, Rather bespeak the state of some great lord, Than of a London merchant. Where's our lady? How sits her title on her? and her daughters, Fair Moll, and blooming Bess? Ledger. Plain Moll and Bess? An' thou would'st 'scape correction, thou had'st best Give them some other titles.âMiss Maria, And Miss Eliza, and with reverence too, Or 'tis more punishable in our house Than scandalum magnatum. Invoice. 'Tis great pity, That such a gentleman as our good master, Whose boundless wealth can so maintain a title, Should want a son to inherit his estate, And keep his name alive. Ledger. The want of one Swells my young mistresses and their proud stepmother With hopes above their birth and scale: their dreams are Of being made countesses, and they take state As they were such already. When you went To th' Indies, there was some proportion Becoming traders in our house; but since My master was by royal favour knighted, 'Tis grown a little court in bravery. Invoice. Is Luke, his brother, living? Ledger. Yes, the more His misery, poor man! Invoice. And still in prison? Ledger. In a worse place, for he's translated hither. Invoice. How's that? Ledger. Why, Sir, since here, as says the proverb, Our mare's the better horse, poor master Luke Hath made an ill exchange. He's freed indeed, But our proud madam takes especial care He still shall feel dependence. She admits him, As 'tis our master's pleasure, to the table, Where, after grace is said, with humble rev'rence He takes the lowest place, and sits the subject Of her contempt and scorn; and, dinner ended, She finds employment for him, suited better To a mere lackey. Invoice. Strange, he should endure it, When other means of living may be found. But hold.âHow wears the time? Ledger. 'Tis almost noon. Invoice. Then must we hasten to th' Exchange. Ledger. I'm with you. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Lady Traffic's Apartment. Enter Furbish. Furbish. I vow 'tis almost noon, and nothing 's ready. Holdfast!âWe shall have pretty work anon, When her sweet, patient ladyship returns. There has she been since morn, gadding about; Her two full-grown daughters-in-law mop'd up, As if they still were children.âWell! 'tis strange, That an old gentleman, like my wise master, Should match himself with such aâ Oh! you're here.â Enter Holdfast. Holdfast. Can one ne'er be at rest?âWhat with your calling, My lady's fancies, and Sir John's commands, I have a blessed time of it among you. What is't you want? Furbish. Good Holdfast, lend a handâ My lady will be back immediately Her toilet's unpreparedâ Holdfast. What 's that to me? I'm not to comb her hair, or fix her patches. Furbish. I wish you were, you'd then have work enough. But do, dear Holdfast, help me to set out These boxesâ Holdfast. What! her red paint and her white?â Faugh! how these perfumes smell!âWell, wise Sir John, You never made so ruinous a bargain, As when you brought this shrew from Lothbury, And, like an amorous dotard, made her tyrant Over yourself, your daughters, and your servants. Furbish. There, that will do.âI told you she was coming. D'ye hear her? Holdfast. Can St. Paul's great bell be heard? It's clamour is the gentlest of the two. Furbish. Forbearâshe'll hear you. [Exit Holdfast. Enter Lady Traffic and Servants. Lady Traffic. Tell Sir John, I wonder. He'll keep that blundering coachman, when he knows How I detest his sluggish stile of driving; Drawl! drawl along, like the Lord Mayor's state-coach, Or Mrs. Deputy Comfit, with her pair Of sleek dock'd cart-horses!âGo, tell him, sirrah, To turn him off, and see I have another Befitting Lady Traffic. [Exeunt Servants.] Furbish! Furbish. Madam! Lady Traffic. I'm tir'd to death!âI have such poor weak nerves! Why, don't you see I'm absolutely fainting From mere fatigueâand there you stand, and gape, And twirl your fingersâ Furbish. Shall I get your ladyship The cordial water? Lady Traffic. Name it notâa chair! Don't you see, ideot! how I shake and tremble? Furbish. There, Madam.â Lady Traffic. There!âHas the wench lost her senses? I'd better wait upon myself at once, Than to be telling youâThere, put it there! Furbish. I'm sure, Ma'amâ Lady Traffic. Silence!âTake my hood off, can't you? How do I look now? Furbish. As I hope to see A poor knight's son and heir walk bare before you When you're a countess (as you may be one Should Sir John die, or leave off merchandize) You look as handsome now as when you married. Lady Traffic. Why, in good truth, I think I use my fortune With a becoming grace.âAnd why not use it, Since I am wedded to a wealthy cit, Who doubles me in years?âWith two grown girls Who strive to vie with me in fashion's walk. I'll prove to all the world I know my rights, And choose to claim themâor wherefore did I marry? Furbish. I vow you've not your equal in the city. Lady Traffic. Nay, now you're quite ridiculous.âWhere are Those gawky misses whom I call my daughters? 'Tis a sad thing to have two may-pole creatures Give themselves airs, as if they had pretensions To attract the attentions of the men. Furbish. Why truly They're old enough to come in for a share. Lady Traffic. Ay, so Sir John says. 'Twere a pretty jest For me to sacrifice my youth and beauty To an old man like him, and have his daughters Become my rivals!âNoânoâI'll take care To keep them at a proper distance, 'till Some lord, attracted by their rumour'd wealth, Or gallant courtier, take them off my hands. Furbish. Your ladyship is right.âBut here they are. Lady Traffic. Aye,âlet them comeâI want to speak to them. Begone!â [Exit Furbish. Enter Maria and Eliza. So; here you areâWell, as I live You've taken pains, Maria, to disfigure Yourself with that strange head. And you, Eliza, You've made yourself a fright. Maria. Will you still treat us As we were children, when you know our age? Lady Traffic. Your age indeed! Do you think, because you're tall That, therefore, you're to shove me from my place, And take upon you to be mistresses? Eliz. If we believe one half our suitors sayâ Maria. We may believe them, surely. Lady Traffic. No, you may not. Think you that any will discover faults In Sir John Traffic's heirs?âWere you as swarth As the foul Ethiop, red-hair'd, lame, and crooked, Let them but glance an eye upon his coffers, And all an angel's attributes are your's. Maria. Whate'er may bring them, we've enough of 'em. My father, ere this morning he went forth, Warn'd us we might expect two new gallants. Lady Traffic. Their names? Maria. Sir Maurice Lacey's eldest son and heir; And a rich country gentleman, one Heartwell. Lady Traffic. What, commoners?âA knight's son and a 'squire? A fit assortment for his lady daughters! Child! There's a native grossness in your father, Which even all my counsels cannot cure.â Enter Sir John Traffic. Sir John. So, Madam, at your old amusements still, Teaching these children to despise their father! Lady Traffic. Why who, Sir John, could have expected you? Cannot I be in private with my daughters Without your troubling us? Sir John. Why truly, madam, Your manners and your style of conversation Of late are suchâ Lady Traffic. Aye, aye, reproach me, Sir. Sir John. You wrong me, madam; I would not reproach you, But I would wish you to respect yourself, And learn more deference to your husband's will. These endless broils, this matrimonial sparring, Are senseless, scandalous. How can these children Feel rev'rence for us, when we prove to them We rev'rence not ourselves? Think you our servants Make not their comments on us, and retail Through the whole parish what they see and hear? But let us have a truce. I came to tell you, Two gentlemen, of fortune and desert, Have ask'd my licence to present themselves As suitors to my daughters. Lady Traffic. How, Sir John! I should have thought, Sir, you might have known better What's due to me, and to your daughters, Sir, Than thus to hawk them round to ev'ry one Who has assurance to present himself. You know I am resolv'd no commoner Shall be my son-in-law. Ladies like them May well aspire to rank and dignity. Take them to court, let them be seen by lordsâ Sir John. Aye, aye, let them be seen; but meantime, madam, My pleasure is that they receive such suitors As I select for them. Lady Traffic. Mighty well, Sir!â You always will insist upon your way, And treat meâyes, you treat me shamefully, Thwart all my wishes, always contradict meâ Sir John. For shame, for shame! Your conscience, madam' knows How falsely you accuse me. But no moreâ I come not here to squabble, but to tell you Sir Maurice Lacey's heir and Master Heartwell Purpose this morning to present themselves As suitors to our daughters. 'Tis my pleasure, They should receive them as becomes their duty. [Exit Sir John Lady Traffiic. Aye, Hector on, Sir!âCommoners, indeed, When there are Earls at court, to make you ladies! Maria. We may wait long enough before they ask us. Sure, madam, if these two are proper gentlemen, Of courtly breeding, handsome too, and rich, We may and ought receive them. Lady Traffic. Grant me patience! Have I for this taught you to bear yourselves As suits my daughters, Lady Traffic's daughters? Given you mine own instructions how to hold Yourselves above the rank of city misses? Eliza. Nay, madam, I am not to blame; I'm sure You can't deny I've follow'd your instructions. I long as much as you can do to soar Into the splendid sphere where pleasure reigns, To give up Easter balls for balls at court, And change the city feasts for the delights Which none but fashion's happy votaries know. Lady Traffic. Answer me not, but do as I command you. Furbish! Enter Furbish. My gloves! I vow I had forgot them. Furbish. Those that your ladyship was pleas'd to order Should be made of the Spanish perfum'd skins? Lady Traffic. The same. Furbish. I sent the prison-bird, poor master Luke, This morning for them, and I marvel why He's not ere this return'd. Lady Traffic. I am surpriz'd Sir John should ever think of making him An inmate as he is. A poor, mean wretch, Idle and sluggish, fitter for a gaol Than to disgrace us as he does at table! Furbish. He's grown extremely careless, and sometimes Presumes to grumble when we give him orders. Were I your Ladyship, I vow I'd clear The house of him. Maria. Poor creature! I don't wonder He feels his change of fortune. Lady Traffic. Feel indeed! What right has he to feel? Maria. The same that we Ourselves would have, were we like him reduc'd To sudden misery. Lady Traffic. When that season comes We may begin to think on't.âOh! you're here! Enter Luke, laden with band-boxes and parcels. You seem, Sir, strangely to forget yourself. Were you tippling last night, you rose no sooner To do what she commanded? Luke. Tippling, so please you? Lady Traffic. Answer me not. Dost dare to grumble, thou, Whom, when thy patrimony was all spent, We sav'd from prison! Luke. I confess I am Your creature, madam, for to your goodness I owe it all. For it you have my prayers, The beggar's satisfaction: all my studies (Forgetting what I was, but with all duty Rememb'ring what I am) are how to please you; And if in my long stay I have offended, I ask your pardon; tho' you may consider, Being forc'd to fetch these from th' old Exchange, These from the Tower, and these from Westminster, I could not come much sooner. Lady Traffic. Silence! Bear them To the next chamber, Sir.âWhy dost not move? Luke. I will! I will, good madam. Lady Traffic. No more murmuring, But go. [Exit Luke. (To Maria and Eliza.) You two may follow meâI've more To say to you. You seem to think yourselves Above my governance; but you shall find, Howe'er Sir John pretends to give the law, That Lady Traffic can maintain her rights, And make you feel her just prerogative. [Exeunt. SCENE III. A Hall in Sir John Traffic's House. Enter Sir Maurice Lacey, Edward Lacey, and Holdfast. Sir Maurice. Be pleas'd, good fellow, to acquaint your master, Sir Maurice Lacey and his son are here, Awaiting his good pleasure. Holdfast. You have chosen A time ill-suited to your purposes, For he hath occupation.âWho comes here? Enter Heartwell. Heartwell. Art thou Sir John's domestic? Holdfast. Aye; what then? Heartwell. Then I request thee to apprize him that One master Heartwell comes to wait on him, And his two fair daughters. E. Lacey. (aside) Mark'd you that? Sir Maurice. Be patient for awhile. Heartwell. Did'st thou not hear? Holdfast. I did. Heartwell. And wherefore go'st thou not? Holdfast. I will. [Exit Holdfast. Heartwell. A crusty knave methinks.âWhom have we here? The goodness of the day be on you, gentlemen. Sir Maurice. On you, Sir, equally. May I enquire What bus'ness brings you hither? Heartwell. Marry, Sir, My business soon is told; if 'twere as soon Brought to conclusion happily, 'twere well. You doubtless know Sir John hath two fair daughters, Joint heirs to his great wealth. To try my chance Of gaining one of them am I come hither. E. Lacey. And which of them d'you mean, Sir, to address? Heartwell. Faith, Sir, that's as it proves. I'll see them both, And, as I like them, choose. E. Lacey. And do you think, Thus like the Turk to throw your handkerchief, And grace submissive beauty by your choice? I wish to know your name and quality. Heartwell. So courteous is your greeting, I will tell you, Frank Heartwell is my name; my quality, A Glos'tershire esquire, whose lands return him Three thousand pounds a year. You know me now. E. Lacey. I do; and now Sir 'Squire, you shall know me. I am this gentleman's apparent heir; Be pleas'd to know him as Sir Maurice Lacey, Who, or his reputation on the Exchange Is falsely rated, hath a fortune far Exceeding your poor rents. And Sir, moreover, I'm here to claim the first choice of his daughters. Heartwell. Concise and pithy. Now hear my reply. Tho' all his rich reversion now were thine, It should not in the way of affection make me Give thee precedence. I will visit them, Tho' thou stood'st porter to deny me entrance. Sir Maurice. We shall have quarrelling anon:âSweet son! Be patientâ E. Lacey. I do hereby give you caution, As you esteem the safety of your lifeâ Sir Maurice. Good Master Heartwellâ Heartwell. Nay, an he begin, I'll not be first to endâ (They draw.) Enter Sir John Traffic and Luke. Sir John. What's here to do? Men of your quality to breed this stir! Hath this fair kingdom no presumptuous foe, That thus you turn your swords against each other? Heartwell. He claims precedence in your daughters' favourâ E. Lacey. He takes upon him to dispute my right Of prior choiceâ Sir John. Was this your ground of quarrel? Is your hot moody-blood so quickly stirr'd, That thus you make my hall your fencing-school? Sir Maurice. Nay, good Sir John, on your old friend's account Pass over this extravagance. (To Edward.) Why, Ned! Has't not a word? E'en now you said too much. E. Lacey. I humbly beg forgiveness for my share In this offence; but, as for him who caus'd itâ Heartwell. Nay, Sir, I ask your pardon too; but for That delicate young gentleman, a time May comeâ Sir John. A time may come?âFor what, I pray? For shame, young men! Do you think my daughters can Be won by such behaviour? You are both Men of respect, and so should treat each other. For my sake do so. Here, approach, shake hands. Come, I'll conduct you to my daughters; there Make your approaches, and, if their affections Can sympathize with your's, they shall not come, On my credit, beggars to you. Good Sir Maurice, I pray excuse me. [Exeunt Sir John, E. Lacey, and Heartwell. Sir Maurice. How now, Master Luke? I'm glad to see you here. Luke. I thank your worship. Sir Maurice. Your hand, good Master Luke! The world's chang'd with you, Within these few months. Then you were the gallant; No meeting at a horse-race, cocking, hunting, Shooting or bowling, at which Master Luke Was not a principal gam'ster, and companion For the nobility. Luke. I have paid dear, Good Sir, for all these follies: 'tis but justice, That such as soar above their pitch, and will not Be warn'd by my example, should, like me, Share in the miseries that wait upon it. Your honour in your charity may do well Not to upbraid me with those weaknesses Too late repented. Sir Maurice. I nor do, nor will; And you shall find I'll lend a helping hand To raise your fallen fortunes. Luke. Generous Sir! Your goodness far exceeds my poor desert. Alas! I have not merited such kindness, Nor can I make return, save by my pray'rs And endless benedictions. Sir Maurice. Say no moreâ Rely on me. I have it in my power To be of service to you: if henceforth You do renounce your follies, and pursue A wiser course, I'll put you in a way To bring up what is past. Luke. I've had enough Of folly, worthy Sir, and have reflected Too seriously upon my late misconduct, Again to be seduc'd by her enticements. Believe me, Sir, I am an alter'd man: My mind is strengthen'd by adversity; And, if good fortune ever should befriend me, I'll make a different use of it. Sir Maurice. That's well. I trust you will. How deals your brother with you? Luke. Beyond my merit. Thank his goodness for it, I am a free man, all my debts discharg'd, Nor does one creditor, undone by me, Curse my loose riots. I have meat and cloaths; Time to ask heav'n remission for what's past; Cares of the world by me are laid aside; My present poverty's a blessing to me; And, tho' I have liv'd long, I dare not say I ever liv'd till now. Sir Maurice. You bear it well, Your brother's generous treatment of you shews He has more feeling than the world allows him. I've heard, that, in th' acquirement of his wealth, He has been accounted harsh, as one who weighs not Whose ruin he builds upon. Luke. In that, report Doth foully wrong him. He is a merchant, Sir, Who would encrease his heap, and will not lose What the law gives him. Sir Maurice. Therein he is right, Nay, much to be commended. Thus it is, That envy oft depreciates good desert! 'Tis certain you are like to know him best; And, were it merely gratitude which makes you Give him this commendation, it becomes you. Luke. My gratitude is boundless, I confess; Yet cannot that, or any other feeling, Lead me beyond the truth. I know him, Sir, For what I do report him, kind and noble. But since your honour, as I grieve to think, Still doubts my unsupported testimony, You are come opportunely. I can bring you, Where you unseen may see and hear his carriage Tow'rds some poor men, whose making or undoing Depends upon his pleasure. Sir Maurice. To my wish. I know no object that could more content me. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An Apartment in Sir John Traffic's House. Enter Sir John, Heartwell, and Edward Lacey. Sir John. This way, good gentlemen.âWho waits? Enter Furbish. Well, Furbish, Where is your lady? Furbish. She is gone forth, Sir; My lady Varnish call'd to give her notice Of a great sale of Indian rarities, Where all the quality will be assembled. Sir John (aside.) Ever thus gadding, and consorting with The vain and idle!âTho' it may be better Her interference should not interrupt us. (To Furbish.) Where are my daughters? Furbish. In their chamber, Sir. Sir John. Require them to come hither. Furbish (aside.) As I live, Two likely gentlemenâwere they but lordsâ Sir John. Will you be pleas'd to call my daughters hither? Furbish. Yes, Sir.â(aside.) Were I in my young ladies' place, They should not ask me twice. [Exit Furbish. Sir John. Well, gentlemen, The absence of my lady will afford you A freer opportunity to judge How far my daughters merit your affections. A father's fondness often may mislead him, But I do think they are deserving of you. Heartwell. That's but a slender compliment, good Sir. She, who can't merit praises far superior To a comparison with my desert, Were hardly worth the seeking, E. Lacey. Your fair daughters Are treasures worthy of a king's ambition. Sir John. Why, they're good girls, and handsome too, I think; A little spoilt, perhaps, by over fondness: And as for fortune, you already know What I can do for them.âBut here they come. Enter Maria and Eliza. What think you now? Heartwell. That the reality Surpasses all that expectation dar'd To picture of perfection. Sir John. That is well. Come hither, lovesâthese are the gentlemen I told you of to-day.âHere, Master Heartwell, And Master Lacey, pray ye know my daughters. (To Maria and Eliza.) Nay, draw not backâthey are deserving of you. Eliza. Their presence, Sir, assures us they are so, And in all courtesy they may expect Such favour as becomes us to confer; But, with observance of my lady's order, They may not ask, nor can we grant them more. E. Lacey. Can such a sentence come from lips like those Which Nature form'd so lovely?âCan disdain Glance from those eyes where ambush'd cupids lurk? Ah! kill not thus the rising hope which cheers A heart already gone an age in love! Eliza. Were I to let you cherish idle hopes, I might deserve reproach. My father knows What I have said is true. Sir John. Aye, aye, I know it, And am asham'd on't. 'Tis a silly whim My lady has ta'en up, that nought beneath Nobility, shall aim at our alliance. Heartwell. I can respect nobility as much As her good ladyship; but know no cause Why a plain honest gentleman should scruple To aim at a fair lady, tho' his 'scutcheon Boast not a coronet.â(To Maria) If I may trust Th' intelligence of that sweet countenance, You'll not confirm this tyrannous decree. Maria. I pray you spare me, Sir. My lady's will Leaves us no choice. Our duty is obedience. Sir John. Come, say no more; this def'rence is mistim'd. I find I have been wanting to myself In giving thus the way to idle fancies. 'Tis time to curb them now.â(To Heartwell and Edward.) Be of good courage: I will stand by you. Maria. Ah, Sir! so you say; But when my lady comes, perhapsâ Sir John. What then? Shall I be govern'd in a case like this? These are two noble gentlemen, whose wealth And character are known, and whose alliance Does us all honour.âNay, you'll find them so. I sanction their pretensions. Master Heartwell, And you, the son of my much valued friend, Speak for yourselves, and boldly urge your suit. You've my full licence. Maria. Nay, Sir, since you please, We must not disobey you. But remember, 'Tis your own doing; you must not desert us. Sir John. Well, well, depend on me. Here, gentlemen, You'll have no interruption. Take their hands, Plead well your cause, and Heaven prosper you. I'm call'd away upon some urgent bus'ness; But you can do without me.âSo, that's wellâ Gain but their hearts, and I'll secure the rest. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Sir John's Counting House. Enter Sir Maurice, Lacey and Luke. Luke. Here, in this chamber, if it please your honour, You may conceal yourself, and overhear What passes 'twixt my brother and those persons Of whom I told you. Sir Maurice. Thanks, good Master Luke: This care for his good name shews nobly in you. I do respect you for it. Luke. 'Tis no more Than I am bound to do. But stay not thus; Take heed he do not see you, Sir.â [Sir Maurice retires. Enter Sir John. Kind brother! To whose blest liberality I owe My freedom, my supportâ Sir John. No more of this. So thou prov'st worthy of my favour, Luke, I never shall repent the good I've done thee: But thou hast still a long account to settle, A vast arrear of follies to bring up, Ere I can hold thee in my confidence. 'Tis not a shew of sorrow, nor professions Of deep regret for errors that undid thee, That can efface their characters. I hope, And would indeed believe, thou art sincere. Luke. Alas! what other means have I to prove My true repentance and my change of life, But those professions and that shew of sorrow, Unless it be obedience to your will, And zeal to serve you? For what else am I But your poor creature, servant to your pleasure, Most bound to you in ev'ry act of life, And living only for your gracious service, And that of your dear lady and fair daughters? Sir John. Prove this, but speak it not. I am come here To learn what Venture and his fellow debtors Can urge to stay the process of the law. Bid them approach. Luke. I do obey you, Sir. [Exit Luke: Sir John. He may be what he seems: there are examples Of thorough reformation brought about By the correction of adversity; But they are rare: the seeds by nature planted Take a deep root i' th' soil, and tho' for a time The trenchant share and tearing harrow may Sweep all appearance of them from the surface, Yet, with the first warm rains of spring, they'll shoot, And with their rankness smother the good grain. Heav'n grant it may'nt be so with him! Enter Luke, Venture, Risk, and Penury. Luke. Here are Your humble suitors, Sir, to wait upon you. Sir John. What would you have me do? (To Luke) Give me a chair. (Sits.) Risk. Be pleas'd, Sir, to consider my hard case. My land is mortgag'd for a third of it's value: I had no more. Pray give me longer day. Sir John. I know no obligation lies on me, To lose my proper right. Your deed speaks for it. How much owes Penury? Luke. Six hundred pounds. His bond too is grown forfeit. Sir John. Is it sued? Luke. Yes, Sir, and execution out against him. Sir John. See it serv'd. Penury. I am undone! My wife and family Must starve for want of bread. Sir John. What's Venture's debt? Luke. Two thousand, Sir. Sir John. Two thousand? an estate For a good man. You were the glorious trader, Embrac'd all bargains, the main venturer In ev'ry ship that launch'd forth. Tell me, Sir, How was this sum employ'd? Venture. Insult me not On my calamity; tho' being a debtor, And slave to him that lends, I must endure it. Yet hear me speak thus much in my defence: Losses at sea, and those, Sir, great and many, By storms and pirates, not domestic riot, Have brought me to this low ebb. Sir John. Storms and pirates! The cant of fraudulent insolvency! Look you, I must and will, Sir, have my money. Venture. I'm in your power, and you must do your pleasure. Luke. Not as a brother, Sir, but with such duty As I should use unto a father, since Your charity is my parent, give me leave To speak my thoughts. Sir John. What would you say? Luke. No word, Sir, I hope shall give offence: nor let it relish Of flattery, tho' I proclaim aloud, I glory in the bravery of your mind, To which your wealth's a servant. Not that riches Are or should be contemn'd, they being a blessing Deriv'd from Heav'n, and by your industry Pull'd down upon you. But in this, dear Sir, You have many equals: such a man's possessions Extend as far as your's; a second hath His bags as full; a third in credit flies As high in the popular voice: but the distinction And noble difference, by which you are Divided from them, is, that you are styl'd Gentle in your abundance, good in plenty, And that you feel compassion in your bowels Of other's miseries, (I have found it, Sir, Heav'n keep me thankful for't) while they are curs'd As rigid and inexorable. Sir John. I delight not To hear this spoken. Luke. That shall not aggrieve you. Your affability and mildness, cloath'd In the pure garment of your debtors' breath, Shall ev'ry where, tho' you strive to conceal it, Be seen and wonder'd at, and in the act With prodigal hand rewarded: whereas such As are born only for themselves, and live so, Tho' prosperous in worldly understandings, Are but like beasts of rapine, that, by odds Of strength, usurp and tyrannize o'er others, Brought under their subjection. Sir Maurice, (listening.) That was well: He puts it to him home. Luke. Can you think, Sir, In your unquestion'd wisdom, I beseech you, The goods of this poor man sold at an auction, His wife turn'd out of doors, his children forc'd To beg their breadâthis gentleman's estate Thus harshly taken, can advantage you? Or that the ruin of this once brave merchant, (For such he was esteem'd, tho' now decay'd) Will raise your reputation with good men? But you may urgeâpray pardon me, my zeal Makes me thus bold and vehementâin this You satisfy your anger and revenge, On those who wrong you. Grant this: it will not Repair your loss; and there was never yet But shame and scandal in a victory, When passion, rebel unto reason, fought it. Then for revenge: by great souls it was ever Contemn'd, tho' offer'd, entertain'd by none But cowards, base and abject spirits, strangers To moral honesty, and never yet Acquainted with religion. Sir Maurice, (listening.) How he speaks! He has won my heart for ever. Sir John. Shall I be talk'd Out of my money? Luke. No, Sir, but intreated To do yourself a benefit, and preserve What you possess entire. Sir John. How, my good brother? Luke. By making these your beadsmen. When they eat, Their thanks, next Heav'n, will be paid to your mercy; When your ships are at sea, their pray'rs will swell Their sails with prosp'rous winds, and guard them from Tempests and quicksands; keep your warehouses From fire, or quench them with their tearsâ Sir John. No more. Luke. Write you a good man in the people's hearts, Follow you ev'ry whereâ Sir John. If this could beâ Luke. It must, or our devotions are but words. I see a gentle promise in your eye; Make it a blessed act, and poor me rich In being the instrument. Sir John (rising.) You have prevail'd. Give them more time. But d'ye hear, no talk on't. Should this arrive at noon on the Exchange, I shall be laugh'd at for my foolish pity. Take your own time; I'll not be hard upon youâ I know what you would sayâthere is no needâ Goâdrink a cup, and thank your orator. Luke. I will attend upon you. [Exeunt Luke, Venture, Risk, and Penury. Sir Maurice advances. Sir John. What, Sir Maurice! Whence come you thus o' th' sudden? Sir Maurice. I must crave Forgiveness for the freedom I have taken To overhear your conference with those, Whose heavy hearts are lighten'd by your goodness. Sir John. You heard all then? Sir Maurice. I did; your kind forbearance, And your good brother's eloquent appeal To your best feelings. Sir John. His discourse was shrewd, And mainly to the purpose. Sir Maurice. 'Twas divine, And breath'd a spirit so attun'd to mercy, I wonder, good Sir John, his qualities Are so pass'd over, that you keep him as A parasite at your table, subject to The scorn of your proud wife, an underling To his own nieces. Sir John. Sir, I have good reason For what I do. First, he had a fair estate, Which his loose riots quickly brought to nothing. This argues ill, you'll own. Next, I've done much For him already; when for heavy debt He was in prison, of all else forsaken, And in his own hopes lost, I did redeem him. Sir Maurice. It was well done of you; exceeding well. Sir John. I hope it was; but I would first be sure He does deserve it, ere I do more for him. His nature was not always what it seems; And virtue, suddenly assum'd, is oft A cloak to cover much depratviy. Sir Maurice. You surely do him wrong. Sir John. Time may afford us An opportunity to know the truth. But we must to our suitors. To speak plainly, I have my doubts of their reception. Nothing, below nobility, can suit My wife's ambition; and, when she is cross'd, She's apt to give full rein to her displeasure. Sir Maurice. I marvel much, Sir John, you should give way To female governance: methinks 'twere well Were you to curb a petulance, that springs From your too great indulgence. Sir John. 'Tis more easy To give good council, than to follow it. Sir, there are secrets in all families, Of which the least we say perhaps the better. But now my mind is fixed upon these matches, And you shall see I can be firm, Sir Maurice! [Exeunt. SCENE III. Another Apartment in Sir John's House. Enter Maria, Eliza, Heartwell, and Edward Lacey. E. Lacey. What can we say to move you to compliance? Will you, like coy princesses in romance, Treat us like errant knights, and send us forth To seek adventures, and to bring home trophies In honour of your beauty? Eliza. We have told you The spell which is impos'd upon ourselves. If you can break the talisman that guards us, You may succeed; if not, your hopes are lost. Heartwell. Why what a strange Urganda is this lady, Who throws up her intrenchments thus around you, To keep off honest-hearted gentlemen, Who would redeem you from such slavish thraldom, And shew you as you are, Nature's perfection! But, if I'm fated to encounter dragons, Let me confront them speedily. Maria. Bewareâ Your enterprize, perhaps, may not prove easy. Heartwell. I'm not so readily to be alarm'd. Place danger on one hand, and you on th' other, And see if I shall flinch. Maria. Give overâhushâ My mother is return'd, I hear her coming. Enter Lady Traffic. Lady Traffic. So, you have got your gentlemen, I see. Maria. This, Ma'am, is Master Heartwell, and this other Sir Maurice Lacy's eldest son and heir. Lady Traffic. Well, Sirs, instruct me what are your commands. Heartwell. With the respect it suits you to receive, And us to pay you, I will speak our purpose. As good Sir John hath told you who we are, What are our means, and how we are dispos'd To make a fitting settlement on her Whom love and fortune may bestow on us, We crave your gracious leave to urge our suit. It were presumption to decide between them; Both are alike so fair and so endow'd With every charm to captivate and keep Affection, that, like Paris, when he held 'Midst rival goddesses the prize of beauty, My wand'ring eye scarce knows on which to fix. But he at length decided for his Venus, And here, so please you, Madam, I choose mine.â (Takes Maria's hand.) E. Lacey. (to Eliza.) When on this hand I bow , and sue for favour, 'Tis not because another has preferr'd Your lovely sister. Had I felt for her What I now feel for you, no power on earth Had forc'd me to surrender her; but when I gaze upon your beauties, hear your voice, See that enchanting smileâForgive me, fair one, If my fond hopes mislead meâI profess Myself your willing slave, and on your sentence Rest all my future views of happiness. What says my lovely judge? Lady Traffic. I'll answer for them: They speak and act but as I please they should. E. Lacey. How well then, Madam, must they act and speak? Lady Traffic. That's not ill said; but truce with compliments: You'll find that more than words are wanting. E. Lacey. Madam, Methinks we have already giv'n you more. What is't you'd have? We have profess'd ourselves Ready to make substantial settlements, Proportion'd to their fortunes. Lady Traffic. 'Psha! a trifle! Heartwell. Our heirs, I fear me, will not find it so, When they're oblig'd to pay it. E. Lacey. Come, good Madam, Do not thus keep us in suspense. Lady Traffic (to E. Lacey.) I think Your father is a merchant. E. Lacey. Aye, a brave one, Equal to any known on the Exchange. Lady Traffic. â(To Heartwell.) And you, Sir, what do you call yourself? Heartwell. A man! An honest man, a country gentleman. Lady Traffic. Stand forth, thou citizen! and farmer, thou! (To E. Lacey.) Think'st thou, because thy father in a bargain Can circumvent a broker, Thou art worthy To match thee with my daughter?â(To Heartwell.) Or think you, Because you feed fat cattle in your marshes, And know the price of corn, how much per bushel, That all this qualifies you to aspire To be my son-in-law. Heartwell. Aye, to be more, Were any thing superior! What's this scorn, Ungracious lady! of your country's honour, An English freeholder? I boast that title, And would not for a foreign dukedom change it. Lady Traffic. Keep it, and welcome; but of this be sure, 'Till you can boast a rank more dignified You are not for my daughter. E. Lacey. Nay, good Madamâ Lady Traffic. You know my mind. What more have you to say? Heartwell. Faith! Madam, little, but that we came here By the permission of Sir John himself, Whose sanction is sufficient for our license. Lady Traffiic. You'll find it otherwise. Sir John', indeed This is a case, Sir, give me leave to tell you, Where I by special privilege may challenge A casting voice; and I will have it too. Heartwell. As by Heav'n's grace, and this fair creature's favour, I trust to call you lady mother shortly, I'll not dispute that with you.â(To Maria.) Say, my fair one, Will you disdain an honest man's affection? Lady Traffic. I do command her silence.â(To Maria.) Come here, girl. (To Heartwell.) Let go her hand.â(To Lacey.) And you too, saucy Sirâ E. Lacey. Nay, Madam, this is wrong. Give us fair playâ Lady Traffic (to Maria and Eliza.) Come here, I tell you bothâloosen their handsâ Enter Sir John and Sir Maurice. Sir John. Hey day! What's all this stir? Lady Traffic. Do you bring plebeians, To mix their puddle with a stream like that Which flows within these veins? Sir John. Patience, good Meg! Why sure thou dost forget thyself, my love! Thy father was a worthy fishmonger, And liv'd in Lothburyâthy mother wasâ Lady Traffic. I'll not demean myself to answer you; But, if you stir a step, Sirâ Sir John. Come, my Molly, And you too, Bess!âWhat say you?âSpeak, my girls. Maria. I scarce can venture, Sir, to speak my mind, Or I should sayâ Lady Traffic. I charge you to be silent. Eliza. Sir, with a maiden's diffidence, I may Presume to tell youâ Lady Traffic. You must talk too, must you? Sir John. Why, won't you let the girl's speak? Lady Traffic. No, I won't. Sir John. What's here to do? Is this becoming treatment For gentlemen like these, my worthy friends, Who honour us by seeking our alliance? Lady Traffic. They may be friends of your's, for ought I care, But they are not fit suitors for your daughters. And as for you, Sir Johnâ Sir John. Nay, nay, no moreâ Hear what I sayâ Lady Traffic. I will not hear a word. I've heard too much already. You and they May carry on your projects as you please, But 'tis full time that I should have my way. (To Maria and Eliza.) Come here, both of you.â (To Heartwell and Edward.) You have had your answer. And you, Sir, your's. We'll see who governs here! (To Maria and Eliza.) There, get you out. Sir John! if you presume To take a single step without my license, I'll make you know both who and what I am, Sir! [Exeunt Lady Traffic, Maria, and Eliza. Heartwell. I'd rather stand upon the bleakest summit Of our bare wolds in a December's night, Wrapt in a wet sheet, than again encounter Such a virago! Farewell, good Sir John! Your daughter is an angel, but your wifeâ I give you joy of her! [Exit Heartwell. E. Lacey. I hop'd to find In your alliance happiness and honor. Your daughter, Sir, is all my fondest hope Could picture of perfection; but her motherâ I spare you more reflectionsâon my soul I pity you, Sir John! I do indeed; Nay, all the world must pity you.âFarewell! [Exit Edward Lacey. (Sir John and Sir Maurice stand looking dolefully at each other. After a pause,) Sir Maurice. Sir John! Sir John. Sir Maurice! Sir Maurice. Our affairs, methinks, Go bravely on. There's in your lady's manner Something so soft, so mild, so captivatingâ I'll warrant me, that your reflections too Must be prodigiously amusing to you. Sir John. Spare me, my friend; the ulcer in my heart Should not be prob'd so roughly. I'm asham'd To think how far my weakness for that woman Has led me to give up my rightful claim To rule in mine own house: but, as the fever, Which riots in our blood, and undermines The source of life, oft brings on its own crisis, So shall my very shame work its own cure. Sir Maurice. That's well resolv'd. But how? Sir John. Give me a momentâ You think my brother Luke a worthy man? Sir Maurice. I'm sure he's such. Sir John. Deserving confidence? Sir Maurice. Why ask you this? Sir John. I have my reasons for it. Well, well; I'll think him so, and as such trust him. Sir Maurice. To what intent, I pray? Sir John. I'll tell you shortly. Let's to the fields, and taste the air awhile. I want a sedative, to calm the choler Which clouds my better judgment. Good Sir Maurice, The time is come, when my proud wife shall learn A lesson, strong enough to teach her wisdom. [Exeunt. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Garden of Sir Maurice Lacey. Enter Sir John and Sir Maurice. Sir John. Now we are private, give me leave, my friend, To unburthen my sad heart. The scene you have witness'd Is but a sample of the violence That robs me of all peace and happiness. I find that I have held too lax a rein, And by indulgence foster'd a proud spirit, Which now disdains all governance. Sir Maurice. 'Tis well You think so. Knowledge of an evil Oft helps one to it's cure. Sir John. Give me your patience. This evil now is grown exorbitant, And calls for instant remedy. I've thought Of one, which haply may succeed. Sir Maurice. Go on. Sir John. Why this, in short, it is. As by indulgence This insolence has risen to it's height, So, by experience of adversity, It may be curb'd. Now, Sir, I have conceiv'd The means of doing this. Sir Maurice. I long to hear it. Sir John. Wealth, and the authority which follows it, Have wrought upon my stubborn lady's pride, 'Till she forgets herself, and what she owes Both to herself and me. My purpose is, By a strong unexpected stroke to cast her From the high pinnacle of vanity, Into apparent ruin and dependence. Sir Maurice. But how may this be done? Sir John. I mean to tell you. Your good opinion of my brother Luke Hath led him to make him mine instrument, I shall require your succour too, Sir Maurice. Sir Maurice. 'Tis at your service in so good a cause. Sir John. I must remain secreted in your house. While you report to my ungracious wife The unexpected tidings of my death. Sir Maurice. Are you in earnest? Sir John. Not to die, believe me, But to be thought dead. You must bear my will, Whereby I give the total of my substance To Lukeâ Sir Maurice. I see it allâ'tis excellent. Sir John. Remember, You must put on a melancholy air. And, as you tell of my disastrous fate, Sigh dismally, and if you can, squeeze out A tear or twoâ Sir Maurice. Leave me to act my part: I'll do it to the life.âOdso! your willâ Where is't? Sir John. It shall be drawn for you forthwith; And here's my secret key o' the counting-house. When you produce them, see you mark th' effect They have upon my brother and my wife. I only fear it may o'erpower her! There is a tenderness in woman's natureâ Sir Maurice. I warrant her; her feelings may be trusted. You ought to know her better. Her proud spirit Wants a corrective, and she'll have one now. Some sudden strong revulsion is requir'd To moderate her hot temperament. Trust me, my friend, both she and you hereafter Will be the better for it. Sir John. Turn as it will, One of my purposes must be fulfill'd. If Luke be such as you conceive he is, If he can bear prosperity as well As he hath stood the shock of adverse fortune, I gain a treasure in him: if he fail, And change of circumstances only serve To bring his evil nature into action, A short dependence on his tyranny Will prove a lesson, not to be forgotten When the delusion's past. Sir Maurice. Howe'er that prove, I feel assur'd your brother will be found Such as I think he is. Sir John. Heav'n grant he may! I loath suspicion: 'tis a fiend that preys Upon the nobler virtues of the heart, And by it's morbid touch converts them all To gall and mortal poison. Prove him well, I pray you; mark his change of countenance When first he hears your tidingsâprobe his soulâ Sir Maurice. Enoughâleave it to me. But comeâtime pressesâ I must set out upon mine embassy. See you keep close; let no one know you're here. Sir John. Away then! may success attend upon you! My happiness depends on your report. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Sir John's Counting-house. Enter Invoice, Ledger, and Holdfast. Holdfast. The like was never seen! Invoice. Why in this rage, man? Holdfast. You may talk of country christmasses, or treats Giv'n at elections, where the tables groan With haunches of fat ven'son, beef and pudding, And gluttons, cramm'd to surfeit, with their teeth Dig their own graves; or you may tell, an you will Of Roman luxury, or modern French, Yet what were they, compar'd with this of our's? Ledger. What's all this noise about? Holdfast. Would'st thou believe? I tell thee, Master Ledgerâs'life! it maddens me To think on such excessâsome hungry devil Has whisper'd in my rampant lady's ear, And taught her how to squander! Such profusion, As in the bill of fare she has deliver'd For one day's meal! Invoice. What is all this to thee? Thou'rt not to pay for it. Holdfast. What's worst of all, When I objected to th' expence, my lady Call'd me penurious rascal, and advis'd me To mind my own concerns. Invoice. She counsell'd rightly. Holdfast. Well, let her take her swing: I care not for't. Three dinners such would break an alderman. I'll have no hand in't. I'll make up my accounts, And, since my master longs to be undone, 'Tis his concern, not mine. [Exit Holdfast. Ledger. That is a maxim, To which I don't subscribe; for, if my master Is in the way to ruin, 'tis the part Of a true servant to promote his wishes. The work is soonest done, when many join. Invoice. That's true. Suppose we lend a helping hand? Could we contrive to compass without danger Such a small trifle as a thousand poundsâ Ledger. 'Twould set us up again. Invoice. It would do so. But how? there lies the pointâoh! Master Luke. Enter Luke. Luke. So, still at work; ever intent upon Your master's interest. Ledger. True, most noble Luke; Like trusty servitors, we were reflecting On the connection that subsists between His int'rests and our own. Invoice. We were debating A case of conscience. Honest Master Luke, Since my return, I've heard of your reverses, The drudgery they put you to, the scorn Wherewith they treat you. I remember, once You were a knowing one, could take the odds, And at a few cool hundreds aims so surely, You seldom miss'd your mark. Luke. Talk not of that: I'm now an alter'd man. Ledger. Alter'd? In what? Your means indeed are less, but you are still The same kind-natur'd, noble soul.âWhat think you? Were a good friend to put you in the road To be reveng'd of fortuneâWhat would'st say? Luke. I'm poor, and therefore I would not object Once more to make experiment of wealth. I am dependent, and I would be free. Ledger. Well, Sirâto put a caseâwere such a friend To shew that you might gain, not only wealth, But independence, would you thank him for it? Luke. I should account him a good friend indeed. Ledger. I guess'd you'd say so.âWell, such friend am I. Luke. You are passing kind. Ledger. I am. Give me your hand. I do compassionate your fallen state, And, were I sure I could confide in thee, I could impart a secret. Luke (aside). What means this? I must know more. (To Ledger) Confide in me, do'st say? I would not wish to worm your secret from you, But as for confidenceâ Invoice, (to Ledger). Tell him at once. I know him well of old. He'll do for us. Ledger. Well, Master Luke, I'll tell thee. We were thinking, Wert thou consenting, how we might devise Means to replenish our exhausted pockets. We all are poor; our master hath abundance; And what would make us rich, would not affect him. What say'st thou to it? Could'st thou not suggest Some efficacious plan? Luke. Has't thou not serv'd Almost thy stated term? (To Invoice) And hast thou traded To farther India, thus to ask me counsel? Go to some other, more expert to treat These subtle practices! I've met with those Can do it well; nay, I have heard them speak Such marvels, as would put Autolycus And Mercury his father to the blush, So far did they outdo them in contrivance. Invoice. What was't they said? Luke. I'll tell you that anon. First I would know if you've no means o' your own To compass this brave enterprize: I warrant You have not liv'd so long without a trial. Ledger. Why, now and then we have made free a little. I'll tell you how we do. We cash-keepers Hold correspondence, and supply each other Whene'er we want. I borrow for a week Two hundred pounds of one, as much of a second, A third lays down the rest; and, when they want, As my master's cash comes in, I do repay it. Luke. You do! that is an excellent device. When you have this, why should you wish for others? Ledger. The pitcher may too oftâyou know the proverb There's an arrear of near five hundred pounds Stares me i' th' face. I needs must wipe it out By some bold stroke. Invoice. And I too must replace Some cash I borrow'd from my master's stock, For a curs'd speculation that deceiv'd me. He will be settling my account ere long. Ledger. Besides all this, we want some present monies, For our occasions: if you'll join with us, You shall have shareâ Furbish (without). Why Luke! Where are you, Luke! Luke. I'm called for. Furbish (without). Luke! I say, my lady wants you! Luke. I must begone. Ledger. When shall we meet again? Luke. Immediately. (aside) A precious couple truly! [Exeunt. SCENE III. Lady Traffic's Apartment. Luke and Furbish meet. Furbish. So! You are come at last. Do you suppose I've nought to do, but follow, and wait on Your leisure, Sirrah? Luke. Truly I made haste. Furbish. Yes, as a snail does; but, I warrant me, You can run fast enough, when dinner calls you. You're never tardy then. Were I my lady I'd keep no sturdy varlet to indulge In sloth and idleness, when he might work, Were he ten times my husband's brother. Luke. Nay, I pray your patience, gentle Mrs. Furbish, I mean not to offend. What is't you want? Furbish. It is my lady wants you. See you stir not 'Till she come here. [Exit Furbish. Luke. I know my duty better. Heav'ns! can I bear to be thus trampled on, To meet with greater contumely than The beggar, who implores the paltry dole Of the way-faring traveller, or sues For offals to appease his rav'ning hunger? SoâsoâsoâsoâI do deserve it all, All that their bitter'st scorn can load me with. Those, who thro' accident or weakness fall, May merit men's compassion; but that I, Who knew profuseness of expence the parent Of wretched poverty, that I should waste My substance, and reduce myself to live on The alms of others, steering on a rock I might have shunn'd! Enter Lady Traffic. Lady Traffic. So, Sir, where is Sir John? Luke. Alas! I know not, madam. Lady Traffic. 'Twould become you T' attend him, Sir, and not to linger thus Idling about the house, eating and drinkingâ Luke. I would have done so, but, when he went hence, He did forbid me. Lady Traffic. Who comes here? Sir Maurice! Enter Sir Maurice. Luke. Know you, Sir, where Sir Johnâ Lady Traffic. Stand farther off! You're no companion for him, and his bus'ness Aims not at you, I think. Luke. I'm silenc'd, Madam! (aside) Must I bear this too! Sir Maurice. What I have to say This gentleman may very fitly hear. Stand forward, Master Luke! Lady Traffic. What mean you, Sir? Know you not who he is? Begone, I say! Sir Maurice. Stay, SirâI know both who and what he is, Which you as yet are ignorant of. Nay, Madam, Frown not, nor let your angry bosom swell With insolent contempt. I have a tale, Which I am griev'd it falls to me to tell, Will make you change your tone. Would I were spar'd The dreadful task I now must execute! Poor Sir John, Madam! Lady Traffic. What of him? Sir Maurice. Is gone! Lady Traffic. Gone? Where?âso suddenlyâwithout a noticeâ Sir Maurice. Aye, Madam, gone to where we all must follow. 'Tis indeed dreadfulâbut the truth must outâ He'sâ Lady Traffic. Speak, nor keep me in suspenceâ Sir Maurice. He's dead! Lady Traffic. Dead, say you, Sir! oh! Sir Maurice. Be compos'd, I pray, And give me your attention. 'Twill behove you. Your conduct, MadamâI must speak strong truths, Work'd on him so, as to o'ercome his reason, And drove him to the doing of an act, Which, when once done, can never be recall'd. This morningâbut I spare you the recitalâ This morn they bore his body to my house, Where, as he went upon his desp'rate errand, He left this instrument. It is his will. Lady Traffic. Oh, worthy Sir! your words have pierced my heart. My conduct caused this fatal act! alas! To what hath it reduc'd me. Sir Maurice. What indeed! 'Tis too late now to remedy your faults, Or for him to forgive them. This small paper Contains your doom. By it, his whole estate In lands, and leases, debts, and present monies, With all the moveables he stood possess'd of, Are pass'd o'er to his brother. [Gives the will to Luke. Luke. How! to me? Sir Maurice. Aye, Sir, to you alone. You're now the owner Of this fair mansion, and of all the wealth Which lately was your brother's. Here, Sir, take The key of 's counting-house. Lady Traffic. Have I no part? I and my daughters, are we quite cut off? Is nothing left for our provision? Sir Maurice. Nothingâ Save what this gentleman, in his free bounty, And from his gen'rous nature, may bestow. Luke (aside). Humph! Sir Maurice. He, I know, is pitiful. Humility From him may gain remission, and perhaps Forgiveness of your former usage. Luke (aside). So! Sir Maurice. Enjoy your own, good Sir; you'll find it ample. But use it with due rev'rence. I once heard you Speak most divinely in the opposition Of a revengeful humour: shew it to her, And those who then depended on the mercy Of your late brother, now at your devotion; And thus confirm the opinion I held of you, Of which I am most confident. Luke. I pray you Give me some time. This sudden change of fortune Might overturn a sounder judgment. Lady Traffic. Sir, I do confess my conduct has been such, As scarcely I can justify, or you Perhaps forgive. Nay, turn not from me, Sir; I do confess my errors, and thus lowly Bend for your pardon. Luke. Madam, pray you rise, And rise with this assurance, if I'm chang'd In any thing, 'tis only in my power. This heap of wealth, Sir, which you bring to me I feel a weighty burthen. Lady Traffic. You shall have My best assistance, if you please to use it, To help you to support it. Luke. By no means: The weight of it shall rather sink me, than you part With one short minute from those lawful pleasures Which you've a right to, in your care to aid me. Whate'er the penalty, I must endure it, But as to it's exerciseâ Sir Maurice. Yet take good heed, Sir, You suffer not your generosity To ruin what he rais'dâ Lady Traffic. And we fall from That height we have maintain'd. Luke. You little guess What shall be your condition. You have held me 'Till now an abject creature, and apportion'd Your treatment to my baseness: now, since fortune Hath rais'd me to this station, you shall find You judg'd not rightly of me. It shall be My study, nay my pride, to approve myself Such as I am. Lady Traffic. Your words speak comfort to me; You are the only stay, the sole support, I now have upon earth. Tho' I was rude, I own it, Sir, with shame, and often us'd you Too roughly for your virtues, yet I knew You had them; but, if I had doubted them, Your present noble conduct would convince me With what profusion they're bestowed on you. Luke. If thus you speak before you've made assay Of my intent, what words will tell your feeling, When I shall give you proof on't? I rejoice Most in my sudden riches, as they afford me The means of shewing how I estimate Your signal claims upon my gratitude. I will invent new fashions to adorn you, To shew your shape and graces to perfection. You have been brave, but shall be now much braver: You hitherto have borne the port of ladies, Fine courtly ladies; but you now shall shew A dignity more fitting your desert. Go to, the world shall see it, and admire. I'll make it the first fruits of my preferment. What garb is this you wear? Doth this become you? Cast off these rags, indulge in splendid dreams Of future greatness, which, when you awake, I'll make conspicuous. But I must be A doer, not a promiser. The performance Requiring haste, I kiss your hands, and leave you. [Exit Luke. Sir Maurice. Are we both turned to statues? Have his words Charm'd us to silence? Lady Traffic. I could ne'er have thought He had this in him. Sir Maurice. He's a noble fellow. I knew he'd prove so. Lady Traffic. To forget so soon Our former treatment of him, so unworthy Of his rare qualities! Sir John himself Was never half so gen'rous or so kind. Sir Maurice. Aye, there indeed! poor man! what loss was his! Lady Traffic. Why certainly, when we reflect upon it, He was a worthy man, and I am sure I feel his loss, and I've a right to do so, And so have his poor daughters. Sir Maurice. Aye, in truthâ Good worthy gentleman! ah! we may live Long ere we see his like! Lady Traffic. To leave us thus Mere destitutesâout of his boundless wealth Not to bequeath us wherewithal to keep usâ I'm sure it is enough to break one's heartâ Sir Maurice. Come, come, take courage; things are not so bad. You hear what Luke, your gen'rous brother, says. Lady Traffic. Aye, he indeed is of a different sort; I see he'll treat us in a nobler way Than Sir John chose to do. He never shew'd Such liberality; his utmost bounty, And that too hardly drawn from him by pray'rs, Was parsimony, when compar'd with this. But I must go, and hasten to his daughters. Poor things! I'm sure they'll want some consolation! [Exit. Sir Maurice. Well, go thy ways, thou art a rare one truly! This will I to Sir John forthwith convey. Our plot goes forward. He will find my judgment In either case confirm'd: his wife, the vain, Imperious fickle thing I thought her ever, And his degraded brother, honest Luke, Unchang'd by wealth, and undebauch'd by power. [Exit. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Counting-house. Enter Luke, hastily. Luke. 'Twas no phantastic object, but a truth, A real truth, no dream! I did not slumber, And could wake ever with a brooding eye To gaze upon't! It did endure the touch; I saw and felt it: yet what I beheld, And handled oft, did so transcend belief, I faintly could give credit to my senses. What art thouâshall I call thee Chance or Fortune? Thou dumb magician, that without a charm Did'st make mine entrance easy, to possess What wise men wish, and toil their lives in vain for? The Sybil's golden bough, the great elixir, Imagin'd only by the alchemist, Compar'd with thee are shadows, thou the substance And guardian of felicity! No marvel My brother priz'd thee: thou'st an owner now, Who can still better estimate thy worth. In every corner of that sacred room Silver is heap'd in bags, as if unworthy To hold an equal rank with the bright gold That boasts pre-eminence: but when mine eyes Had made discovery of the caskets, kept Under a double safety, and they open'd, Each sparkling diamond from itself shot forth A pyramid of flames; sapphires and rubies, And ropes of oriental pearlâThese seen, I could not But hold cheap gold itself.âThen, in a coffer, Lay deeds of gift, bonds, and securities, And, above all, what gladden'd me to see, A manor, fast bound in a skin of parchment, The wax continuing hard, the acres melting, Pawn'd to my brother. There is scarce a shire In Wales or England, where my monies are not Lent out at usury; the certain hook To draw in more.âI am sublim'd! gross earth Supports me not!âI walk on air!âWho's that? Enter Holdfast. Keep off!âyou shall not touch it!âOh, 'tis you! I knew you not at first.âWell, honest Holdfast! What is't you want with me? Holdfast. There are some here Who do enquire for you; your needy debtors, Risk, Venture, Penury. Luke. What brings them here? Holdfast. I do suppose they've heard of what has happen'd, And come to practice on your lib'ral temper. Luke. How well they guess me! Shew them straightway in. Holdfast (aside). Plague on such gen'rous doings! I see beggary Already knocking at the door.âYou may enterâ But use a conscience; do not work upon A tender-hearted gentleman too much: 'Twill shew like charity in you. [Exit Holdfast. Enter Venture, Risk and Penury. Luke. Welcome, friends: I know your hearts and wishes; you are glad You've chang'd your creditor. Venture. Heav'n bless you, Sir. Luke. What is your bus'ness? Venture. Were your brother living, I ne'er had hazarded to speak it, Sir; But now the pow'r is in your worship's hand, I am assur'd as soon as ask'd 'tis granted. Luke. I see you know me.âWell? Venture. The kind forbearance Of my great debt, by your means, worthy Sir, Hath rais'd my sunk estate. I have two ships, Which I long since thought lost, above my hopes Return'd from Portugal, and richly laden. Luke. Where are they? Venture. At Gravesend. Luke. And what their names? Venture. Happy Return and Plenty. Luke. Good names both. At Gravesend, say you? Venture. Aye, at Gravesend, Sir. Luke. I'm glad to hear on't. Venture. Heav'n reward your worship! Now might I have your license, as I know With willingness I shall, to make the best Of the commodities, tho' you have execution 'Gainst me and all I have, I shall be able To pay off what I owe to all the world, And leave myself a competence. Luke. Enoughâ I'll take good care of you. I am right glad Your ships are safe arrived.âWell, Master Risk? Risk. You know my mortgage is foreclos'd; you may By law seize on my lands and ruin me. Sir John had done it, Sir, had you not sway'd him Now, Sir, I crave of you but three weeks patience: By an uncle's death I have means left to pay all. Luke. That's fortunate; for, if I recollect, Your land's not mortgag'd for a third of it's value. Risk. No more, good Sir. Luke. Leave it to me, I'm not, As well you know, a creditor like my brother. Well, Master Penury, what is your state? Penury. Just as it was, good Sir; the worse my luck! What I ow'd I owe, but can pay nothing to you Yet the great kindness you've already shewn me, And your sweet nature, Sir, embolden me To crave a favour from you. Luke. What is it? Penury. That you'd be pleas'd in charity to intrust me With another hundred pounds. Luke. How would you use it? Penury. There is a sailor, Sir, arriv'd from India, Who brings a certain rare commodity, Of which, for ready money, I could make. Such gain, as would rebuild my shatter'd fortune. This way, Sir, if you pleaseâThere is his name, And the particulars I wish to deal for. [Gives Luke a paper, which he reads, and puts in his pocket. Luke. I'm glad you spoke of it. The thing is done. Make no more words on't.âWell, my worthy friends, I take it kind of you you came to me. Pray ye have some refreshment now you're here. I am call'd out for some half-hour or so; When I return, we'll settle every thing. [Exit Luke. Risk. Blessings go with you! Penury. Heav'n preserve you, Sir! Venture. Happy were London, if there were but three such! [Exeunt. SCENE II. An Apartment in Sir Maurice's House. Enter Sir John and Sir Maurice, meeting. Sir John. Welcome, Sir Maurice! Well, what news do you bring? Say, doth my brother, still maintain th' opinion You form'd of him. Sir Maurice. In truth I never saw A nobler gentleman, or one whose spirit Seems better moulded to prosperity. No change appears in him, unless it be He now is humbler than he was, more kind, And more attentive to promote the good Of all around him. 'Tis methinks a pity His splendid fortune is so visionary: Were he in fact possessor of such means, Thro' a wide sphere his bounty would extend, And this our iron age, sublim'd by him, Would beat the poet's boasted age of gold. Sir John. Is he such truly? Sir Maurice. Can I doubt my senses? It was but now, as hither I repair'd, I call'd in at his house. He had gone forth, But I beheld a scene, which might have touch'd The most obdurate heart. Those ruin'd men, Whom, at your worthy brother's intercession, You had shewn favour to, were there assembled, Partaking of his hospitality, And praying for a blessing on the hand, The charitable hand, that had redeem'd them From poverty and ruin. Oh, 'twas sweet To hear how gratefully they spoke his praise! Sir John. My doubts are vanish'd. When your dream of wealth Is over, my good brother, you shall wake To better fortune than of late you've known. Sir Maurice. All will commend you for't. Sir John. There's but one thing Which takes from my full pleasureâmy proud wife. Had she, instead of new indulgences, Been taught a lesson of adversity, She might have been reform'd: as 'tis, I fear Her wayward nature will but gain fresh strength, And she herself grow irreclaimable. Sir Maurice. Why there, indeed, I fear your project fails. If nothing but severity can cure her, Your hopes are small from him. Such tenderness, Such earnestness to meet her utmost wishes I never witness'd.âBut, we do forgetâ Our suitors, Ned and Heartwell, are below, Waiting your presence. Sir John. Let us hasten to them, And ascertain, should our device succeed, How their affections yet stand tow'rds my daughters. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Counting-House. Enter Luke. Luke. 'Tis strange how soon a change of circumstance Alters men's minds and manners. Yesterday I was poor Luke, a mere despis'd dependent Upon another's charity; but now I'm grown right worshipful, become a patron, And, wheresoe'er I deign to turn my glance, Your purse-proud citizens, with cap in hand, And bended knee, strive who shall pay me homage. One, who 'till now ne'er deign'd to look on me, Congratulated me upon the wealth Thus fallen on me. I could scarce refrain From laughter, when, with apt humility, I answer'd himââGood Sir, a trifle merely; âThe substance you conceive so great no way âAnswers it's rumour'd magnitude; alas! âWith a great charge I'm left but a poor man.â âPoor!ââquoth my citizen, with feign'd surprize. Now came my answerââPoor, compar'd with what â'Tis thought I do possess: some little land, âFair household furniture, a few good debts, âBut empty bags I find; yet I will be âA faithful steward.ââThus I talk'd to them, While they, the more I strove to underrate My affluence, conceited me more rich. Enter Holdfast. Well, Sirrah Holdfast!âhave you ta'en good care Of those I trusted to your charge? Holdfast. Aye, marry, If giving them enough be taking care. There they're all sitting, with your hopeful clerks, Eating and drinking, gayly quaffing bumpers To their kind patron's health.âYou begin wellâ Keep open houseâlet who will live upon youâ 'Tis your true wayâI never knew it fail. Luke. Why, Holdfast! what is't moves your choler thus? Holdfast. Nay, I'm a fool; 'tis no concern of mine; Your riches are your own; do as you please; However deep a well it has a bottom, And may be drain'd.â Luke. You speak like oracles; But we'll discourse of this when we've more leisure. Meantime, bring here my brother's wife and daughters. [Exit Holdfast. If riches are a burthen, they're a light one. Methinks I'm like a captive, from whose limbs The shackles that confin'd him are remov'd. My heart is light, my spirits brisk and lightâ Enter Lady Traffic, Maria, Eliza and Holdfast. So, you are hereâWhy, how now? What means this? Is't thus, I am obey'd? Where are the habits I order'd for these women? Holdfast. Not come home. Luke. And wherefore not? Holdfast. It is the tailor's fault. He says he has some other work in hand, Which must be finish'd ere he set about them. Luke. Plague on his tardiness! Go to him, sirrah! And bid him hasten. [Exit Holdfast. Lady Traffic. Nay, my kind brother, I pray you don't distress yourself about us. The garments we already have will suit us. Luke. No, they will not. You shall have others soon, More corresponding with your state and merits. You shall lay by this flimsy garniture, These vain appendages of senseless folly, And have your outsides as disrob'd of pomp As are your fallen fortunes.âRussetâdowlasâ The lowliest raiment of the humblest she, Who seeks her scanty maintenance by labour, Will suit you better than these tinsel trappings. Lady Traffic. Why what is this, Sir? You are not in earnestâ You cannot meanâI do protest at first You frighten'd meâHad I not known you better, I should have thought you meditated things Most foreign to your kind and gen'rous heart. Luke. You'll find I mean what I have said. Lady Traffic. Alas! Do you thus preserve your protestation to me? Maria. Is this fit treatment for us, Sir? Eliza. Are those Becoming habits for your brother's daughters? Luke. 'Twould suit you more to thank my weak indulgence, Which gives you licence to appear in them, Than to be thus exceptious. I'm the judge Of what befits your station. Would you ape The fashions of court-ladies, whose high titles And pedigrees of long descent give warrant For their superfluous brav'ry? Lady Traffic. Will you break Your promise to us then? Luke. No! I'll make good My promise, and will shew you like yourselves, In your own natural shapes, and stand resolv'd You shall continue so. Lady Traffic. Most worthy Sirâ Luke. Sir? Sirrah! That's your term. Use your old phrase. You know I'm us'd to bear it. Lady Traffic. I implore you Hold not remembrance of it. I acknowledge I have deserv'd ill of you, yet despair not, Tho' we are at your disposure, you'll maintain us As suits our just pretensions. Luke. 'Tis my purposeâ Lady Traffic. Nor make us thus ridiculous. Luke. It was Your insolence that made you so, your pride, Your strange forgetfulness of what ye were, And your contempt of those, whose purses could not Hold equal rate with your extravagance. What right had you to arrogate a rank, To which you'd no pretensions? Who were you, To claim precedence, and to hold a state, To scorn your equals, and to treat your brother As he were meaner than the dust you trod on? Who rais'd you to the pow'r you thus abus'd? Your husbandâbrother of that humble Luke, Your quondam servant, now your master, lady! Lady Traffic. Alas! alas! (weeping.) Luke. Aye, bring your spirit down To a level with your fortune. I'll cut off Whatever is exorbitant in you, Or in those Madams, and reduce you to Your natural form and habits. You shall now Learn to employ your time to better purpose Than you were wont; those taper fingers now Shall grow industrious; I'll have spinning-wheels And distaffs for you; you shall learn to dress And serve each other; for I'll have no drones, No waiting women to attend upon you. You know my pleasure! Lady Traffic. Oh my pride and scorn! How justly am I punish'd! Maria. Now we pay A heavy price for past indulgences. Had you but treated Heartwell with more favourâ Eliza. Had you not shewn young Lacey such disdain, We had not thus been subjected to him. Lady Traffic. Heap not fresh causes of regret upon me; I feel enough already. Luke. Do you so? I'm right glad on't. 'Tis as it should be. Away! set to your tasks! (Exeunt Lady Traffic, Maria and Eliza. So! that's well done. This act of justice o'er, now for my clients. Their business will be shortly settled. Holdfast! Enter Holdfast. Send in the gay companions you have yonder. Holdfast. Here! please you to come up! They'll talk you now Into whate'er they please. They know your temper, And how to take advantage of your softness. Aye, aye, I hear you! Marry, 'tis no wonder You're in high spirits.â Enter Venture, Risk, Penury, Ledger, and Invoice. Luke. Holdfast, leave us. [Exit Holdfast. Well, You see I've not delay'd you. All is ready For finishing your business. Venture. Worthy Sir, We are your servants. Risk. Our best thanks are weak. Penury. We're bound to pray for you. Luke. Not bound as yet. (Stamps with his foot.) Enter Bailiffs. First Bailiff. You Invoice, and you Ledger, I arrest you Each for a thousand pounds. Second Bailiff. Risk, Venture, Penury, I do arrest you. Venture. Me, Sir? at whose suit? Second Bailiff. There's our employerâyou had better ask him. Venture. At your's, good Sir? Penury. It is impossible. Ledger. Nay, Sir, this passes jest. Luke. (to the Bailiffs.) Are you not more Acquainted with the dangers of a rescue, Than to stand parleying with them thus? The Compter Is their fit place. Invoice. And can you be in earnest? Luke. Aye, marry, Sir, and you shall find it so. Ledger. What have we done that you should treat us thus? Luke. Poor innocent! you know the tricks of trade, Hold correspondence with your fellow cashiersâ There's a small trifle of five hundred pounds, For all of which you'll please to account. You might Defraud my brother; if you can, evade me. Penury. Your worship will not be so hard with us? Luke. Pay to the uttermost farthing what you owe, Or lie in prison. Venture. Can a gentleman Of your soft feeling temper speak such language? Penury. So honest, so religiousâ Risk. One that preach'd So much of charity for us to your brother? Luke. Yes, when I was in poverty it shew'd well; But I inherit with his state his mind And his more stubborn nature. I then might, For weighty purposes, discourse of pity, The poor man's orisons, and such like nothings; But what I thought you now shall feel, and home too. Kind master Luke hath said itâoff with them! Venture. Hear me but one word! let me make the best Of my two ships! Penury. Lend me the sum you promised! Risk. A few weeks patience to redeem my mortgage! You shall be satisfied! Venture. To the last farthing! We do most humbly beg for your compassion! Luke. I'll shew some mercy, which is, that I will not Torture with idle hopes, but make you know What you shall trust to. Your ships to my own use Are seiz'd on. I have got into my hands Your bargain from the sailor; 'twas a good one For such a petty sum. I likewise take Th' extremity of your mortgage. Risk. Mercy! Venture. Have pity! Penury. Spare us, worthy Sir! Luke. Move mountains with your breath! It shakes not me! Here! do your duty! Carry them away! (Exeunt severally.) END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Counting-House. Enter Luke. Luke. I'll give no further audiences to-dayâ Tell those who wait, they may return to-morrow, When I shall have more leisure. What is wealth, If it can't purchase pleasure for it's master, And minister delight; For one short day I've wrought enough; what rests shall be mine own. I will indulge in varied luxury, In due gradation gratifying each sense, 'Till satiated they sink into repose, And cushions of soft yielding down invite me To court th' embraces of restoring sleep. Who waits! Enter Holdfast, Come here. Thou ha'st been us'd to cater? Holdfast. Aye, marry, in Sir John's time I've been us'd. He kept the noblest table in the city. Luke. 'Twas but a board for beadsmen, when compar'd With what I mean to keep. This day I'll put Thy talents to the test. See thou prepare A feast for me, more sumptuous than e'er grac'd Our civic meetingsâ Holdfast. What guests have you? Luke. None! I'll sit alone, and surfeit in my store, Whilst others wanting pine with envy at me; My happier genius pamper'd with the thought Of what I am, and what they long to be. Holdfast. Less surely might suffice. Luke. Say that again And I will double it. Prescribe to me! Have I not means enough? am I not rich? Holdfast. I'm silenc'd. (aside) Nobody to sup with him! Luke. Go! Let bright tapers emulate the day, While subtlest perfumes spread their mingling sweets, And music floats i' th' air. Begone, and do it! [Exit Holdfast. This is to live! I'll rack my brain to invent Diversity of pleasureâ Enter Holdfast. Holdfast. Here are two, Who say they needs must speak with you forthwith Luke. Did I not tell thee I would be alone? Holdfast. Aye, but these come upon a pressing errand. The fathers of your two apprentices, To supplicate your mercy. Luke. Let them enter. Enter Old Invoice and Old Ledger. Old Invoice. Good Sir, we do presume to wait upon you, As humble intercessors for our sons. Luke. Your sons? yourselves, I rather take it. Old Invoice. Sir! Luke. Why know you not I have your bonds within, For their upright demeanour in my service? The penalties are weighty, let me tell you. Old Ledger. We know it, worthy Sir, and we are come To learn what is your pleasure. Old Invoice. So you please To use a conscienceâ Old Ledger. Which we hope you will do, For your own worship's sake. Luke. A conscience, say you? You know the penalties your bonds contain? I'll shew you I've a conscience. I require No more than their extent. Old Invoice. What say you, Sir? That is two thousand pounds a piece. Luke. 'Tis so. Your memory is correct. Old Ledger. Two thousand pounds! Where think you we can raise it? Luke. Where you please. That's your concern not mine. Old Invoice. No moderation? Luke. I have your bonds. Look to it. Old Invoice. We are undone! Old Ledger. Our families are ruin'd! Do, good Sir, Pray take compassion on us! Luke. If ye fail me, Your lodging is the Compter. Holdfast! Enter Holdfast. Here! Turn out those whining dotards, and then take Lights to the banquet chamber. Do it quickly! [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. Lady Traffic's Apartment. Lady Traffic, Maria and Eliza discovered, in poor habits, each at a spinning-wheel. Lady Traffic. (rising.) I cannot compass itâmy hands, unus'd To labour, are unable to perform The servile task impos'd on me. Good Heav'n! Am I reduced to this! I, who so lately Scarce spoke my will before it was obey'd, To be so suddenly reduc'd, brought lower Than a poor menial!âI shall go distracted! And can ye patiently endure such sufferance? Maria. How can we otherwise? Those days are past, When, by th' indulgence of a tender father, We had no other care than how to spend Our time in pleasure, and no other thought Than to invent new means of happiness. Eliza. Alas! we knew not then how blest we were; We ne'er conceiv'd, when fortune smil'd on us, How soon we should experience a reverse. Oh, my dear father! what a loss was thine! Lady Traffic. I charge you touch not on that string; it jars, And to my very heart conveys a pang, Sharp as a viper's tooth. Oh! it was I, Senseless, inhuman woman! I, who drove him To act this desperation on himself, Compell'd that hand, that never was extended Tow'rds me but in affection, thus to arm Against his precious life! Oh, mercy, mercy! (kneels.) Forgive me, righteous Heav'n! Maria. Dear madam, rise; Give o'er this unavailing sorrow. Lady Traffic. No! Conscience will speak. 'Twas I, my children, did itâ I struck the blow, I robb'd you of your father! Eliza. You judge indeed too hardly of yourself. Lady Traffic. Ah! could I now implore his blest forgiveness, Fall prostrate at his feet, confess my fault, And call him to be witness of the change Wrought on my stubborn heart! That is denied me; But what remains within my pow'r I'll do. I'll cast far from me that offensive pride, Those rebel inclinations that undid us; To the low level of our humble fortunes I will reduce myself, and by contrition Atone for what is past. And can you pardon My treatment of the youths who sought your hands? Maria. Alas! why will you still invent new cause For vain regret? Let us not talk of them. Sister, how goes your task? What, sigh? Take courage; Mine, as you see, advances. We must now Learn how to be industrious. We have need on't. Enter Holdfast. Holdfast. I have it in command from master Luke, To tell you that your dinner is prepar'd. Lady Traffic. Tell him, we feel his kind attention tow'rds us, But wish not to attend his festive board, While yet our sorrow's fresh. We should prefer Some small collation in our private chamber. Holdfast. That's fortunate; for such is his intent. In the next room there is your table spread, And your collation waits you. Lady Traffic. Little now Will serve us. Holdfast. That is fortunate again. What he allows you will not breed a surfeit. Three slices from a wholesome household loaf, With water wherewithal to wash it down, Is what his bounty sends you. [Exit. Lady Traffic. Come, my poor girls! I could not hope for better, For I have not deserv'd it. But for youâ Maria. Let not a thought for us increase your anguish. Whate'er your fortunes are, we'll share in them. Lady Traffic. Sweet girl! I've not deserv'd this kindness from you: You know not how it sooths my anguish'd heart And strengthens it to bear this weight of woe. If you can thus forget my treatment of you, We will sustain adversity together, And patiently submit, 'till pitying Heav'n Compassionate our sufferings! [Exeunt. SCENE III. A splendid Apartment, lighted up. At the farther end a Table, covered with a Banquet, at which Luke is discovered sitting.â(Soft Music.) Luke (rising.) Give o'er! I've had enough! This is true wisdom, When a rich man like me lives to himself In his full height of glory. I can brook No rival in this happiness: it comes With double relish, when I do reflect, That, while I taste this plenitude of bliss, So many want it. Brightness to the star That govern'd at my birth! Shoot down thine influence, And with a perpetuity of being, Continue this felicity, not gain'd By vows to saints above, and much less purchas'd By anxious industry: I owe it all To my best friend, dissimulation, And to the specious shape I wore of goodness: I'll drink another cup.â(Drinks.) This gen'rous liquor Invigorates my heart, makes my warm fancy Grow wanton. Would I had one to behold me In my resplendent height of rich enjoyment, One, from whose baseness my transcendent splendor Might doubly be reflected! Enter Holdfast. What brings thee? Holdfast. Sir Maurice Lacey would have access to you. Luke. By Heav'n! he comes beyond my hope.âAdmit him. [Exit Holdfast. What brings him here o' th' sudden? 'Tis no matter. He's a prime citizen, a man of worship, My whilom advocate, good easy man! The voucher of my honesty and honour. He shall have proof on't. Enter Sir Maurice. Good Sir Maurice Lacey! This is most kind of you. You take me here A little unexpected: had I known Of this high honour, I had been prepar'd. Sir Maurice. Your privacy, methinks, appears to equal The state of others: but I come not here To share your luxury. Luke. To what other cause Am I indebted for this favour then? Sir Maurice. I held you for a man of worth, believ'd you Honest, religious, kind, compassionate, Perfect in all the theory of virtue. How comes it then, that tow'rds the very persons, Whose cause you advocated with your brother, You've acted with such cool barbarity? How could you bear to hear those aged men, Bow'd with affliction for their son's misconduct, Implore your pity, yet deny their suit? Have you so soon forgot, with your dependence, Your principles and feelings? Luke. Have you said? Sir Maurice. I have, and wait your answer. Luke. Thus it is: My fortune is mine own; I may dispose it As best may suit my pleasure, or convenience. I am no boy, to bow me to correction, Nor have you, as I think, a right to apply it. You have my answer, Sir. Sir Maurice. Is't come to this? Was then your seeming sanctity assum'd But as a cloak to cover your depravity? Luke. It answer'd well its purpose, for it gave me The good things I possess. Sir Maurice. Bold hypocrite! You think you stand securely: but bewareâ Luke. I thank you for your caution. Good Sir John Will not rise from his grave to throw me down, And as for what thou say'st, it moves me not. Sir Maurice. These monies, strangely fallen thus upon you, Have giv'n you much assurance. Luke. They have so: And good Sir Maurice, now you talk of monies, Be pleas'd to pay in what you owe to me. You'll give me leave to wonder, that your wisdom Should thus afford you leisure to discuss These petty bus'nesses, you being yourself So in my danger. Sir Maurice. In thy danger? Luke. Mine. I find among my deeds a manor pawn'd, Pawn'd, good SirâLacey Manorâto my brother Pawn'd for ten thousand pounds in hand laid down. You are a man of worship; so, Sir Maurice, Pray pay you in my monies. Be not surpriz'd; Tho' you do bear me hard, I'll shew I love you. There is a thing they call a writ, and one Who has authority to serve it on you. I should be loth to see your name disgrac'd, And that same Compter is an awkward lodging For one so dignified as you. You're angry For my good counsel! Well, Sir, had I known Your coming, I had had my serjeants ready For your reception. Sir Maurice. I am dumb with wonder! Luke. Now rail at me again.â(Drinks.) Here's to your health And good digestion! Sir Maurice. Thou'rt so lost in baseness I'll not reply to thee. When next we meetâ Luke. As that, if right I guess, may not be soon, Stay but a moment, and I'll give you more For pleasant contemplation. Holdfast! Enter Holdfast. Holdfast. Sir! Luke. Bring here those women! [Exit Holdfast. Nay, Sir, you shall see I don't do things by halves. When I begin, I know how to go thro'. Enter Lady Traffic, Maria, and Eliza. As you are their friend, It cannot but be pleasant to behold them Deck'd with the robes that suit their wretchedness. Dowlas, tho' coarse, is warmâ Sir Maurice. Cool! Specious villain! Was it for this thy too indulgent brother Gave thee his wealth? Luke. My answer's plain. It was. He was a provident and wise testator, Who knew us both, and made a just distinction. To them, whose arrogance provok'd his fate, He left their due, contempt and poverty, While to my merits he shew'd due respect, And made me independent and their master. (To Lady Traffic), I've done with you, hence, to your chambers, go! And set about your tasks. Sir Maurice. Stay yet, I pray you: I've somewhat more to say to this bad man. Tell me, if yet thou hast or sense or feeling, Is't thus you keep your specious promises You made this wretched lady, when hard fate Cast her and thine own nieces on thy bounty? Hast thou no pity on their suff'rings? Luke. No! They'd none for mine. Their reign is at an end; 'Tis now my turn to rule. I've felt their sway, And now I'll shew them what my mercy is. Sir Maurice. Good lady, be of cheer. He may relent. Luke. Aye, when revenge is satisfied; no sooner. Lady Traffic. Forbear, good Sir, nor try to move him further. The mis'ries I sustain are small, compar'd With my past errors: if my suff'rings can Atone for them, I gladly will endure them. Small are the ills wherewith he threatens me. What matters it what raiment I put on? What is the labour, what the scanty food, To which his sentence dooms me, but the penalty Impos'd upon a disobedient wife, Who never knew the treasure she possess'd, 'Till she for ever lost it! Sir Maurice. If you feel, If you do truly sorrow for your faultsâ Lady Traffic. To feel! to sorrow! they are terms too gentle. Repentance, never ending but with life, And pray'rs and tears pour'd forth to angry heav'n, Are now my consolation and sole hope. Sir Maurice. Take courage, lady; comfort may appear. And thou, obdurate man! whose savage heart Nor gratitude, nor pity can assuage, Tho' now from thy proud pinnacle of greatness On all within thy sphere thou rain'st down plagues, Beware, look to thyself; the angry bolt Of veng'ance now is bursting o'er thy head! [Exit Sir Maurice. Luke. Rail on, vain dotard! Thou art in my pow'r, And soon shalt feel it. As for you, proud Madam! I'll make you feel it too; you shall perceive I am the master of your fate; each hour Shall teach you what dependance upon me is. Lady Traffic. I am prepar'd for all; it will but make me Contrast more strongly my lamented husband With his degenerate heritor. Luke. Your husband! Could he but know the treatment I will give thee, My vengeance would be full. Oh! that the grave Would yield him up again, such as he was, Complete in all his senses and affections, Here would I stand, and as his eyes met mineâ Have mercy! save me! (he staggers to a chair). [Lady T. falls on her knees. Enter Sir John, Sir Maurice, Heartwell, and Edward Lacey. Sir John. (To Lady T.) Rise, I am thy husband, Thy living husband. Once more in mine arms I hold thee, and receive thee as my treasure! Maria and Eliza. My father! Sir John. Let me hold you to my heart. Lady Traffic. Am I awake? Art thou, art thou indeed Restor'd? alas! and can you condescend To notice one who has so ill deserv'd Your tenderness? Sir John. Be all forgotten, love! That can allay our present happiness. (To Heartwell and E. Lacey) Why stand you gazing here? Are you afraid To seize the yielding hand which thus I give you? E. Lacey. I take it as the pledge of future blessings! Heartwell. Lady, I hold my life but as your servant By this fair hand I swear I dearly love you. Sir Maurice. That's well.âNow turn thee from this scene of joy, And look on that fall'n'wretch.âArouse thee, man! Behold th' avenger of thy crimes before thee. Sir John. Rise, brother! Luke. NoâI cannot look upon theeâ I'll fall yet lowerâthus, upon the ground My fittest place, I will lie humbly prostrate, And supplicate for pardon and for favour. Sir John. Pardon thou hast; but look not for my favour Thou hast offended, Luke, beyond remission. I've known thy practices, thy tyranny, Thy dark dissimulation. Those who suffer'd By thine oppression, are again set free: But, tho' thy wish was foil'd, thy base intent Bears everlasting testimony 'gainst thee. Luke. Let me implore you to look kindly on me! I am a poor weak man, who will obey you, Live but in your good favourâ Sir John. I have said. Luke. Do you bereave me then of ev'ry hope? Am I cast off for ever and abandon'd? Sir John. Give o'er for shame. I've answer'd thee already. Luke (rising.) Hope then is gone, and I'm once more myself! There! triumph o'er the wreck you see before you! Heap insult upon insult!âI defy you!â Bar not my way!âthe world is wide enough For all to range in. I will find my part, And work my way in't. Curses light upon you! [Exit Luke. Sir John. What strange obduracy!âBut come, my love! Let us retire, and pondering on what's past, May we be taught to estimate our blessings, And shun those arts, which still defeat their aim, And lead their vot'ries to contempt and shame. [Exeunt. THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Written by S. J. Arnold, Esq. AND SPOKEN BY Mrs. Edwin. Cur'd of my folly as a scolding wife, Sir John, at last, shall lead a quiet life! Ye henpeck'd husbands!âAh! I greatly fear, That many of that gentle class are here! Attend awhileâa wife reform'd shall school ye, And shew why wives rebelâhow women rule ye! When first, in artful blandishment array'd, You court with smiles and pray'rs th' unguarded maid, How full of wit each wordâof charms each featureâ She's angelâgoddess then!âcelestial creature! While sheâpoor silly maid, takes all forsooth! What female heart can doubt such charming truth? The wedding o'er, how soon these high notes fall! This angel proves mere woman after all! The great discovery made, how chang'd the tone! The husband coldâthe wife indifferent grown. 'Stead of, âMy dearâmy loveâmy treasur'd prize,â âDamme my dear!â and âzounds my love,â he cries! While she soon grown by disappointment cold, Replies,âresents, and ends a downright scold! Now comes her triumph! for you'll all allow When women choose to ruleâwe all know how! For where's the man who dares, or old or young To take the field against a woman's tongue? Yonder I see a lady by the bye, She with sharp nose, and little scolding eye; âAndâor his looks have very much belied her, Her cara sposa there, sits close beside her! âThat roundâfat gentleman who looks so blueâ You needn't hide your faceâI don't mean you! Now, as I take it, this harmonious pair, Can prove what man and wife in general are! Married for love in youth's impetuous hour, They dream'd of endless joy in Hymen's bow'r: But long before the honeymoon was o'er, A quarrel rose, which lastedâevermore! âMy love,â said he one evening, âI don't choose, âThat you should wearâmy dearestâso much rouge!â âNot rouge!â cried she in agony, âI vow âMy loveâthat's quite provoking now!â Tears 'gan to fall, and with the rouge to mingleâ âYou ne'er found fault with rouge when I were single!â ââZounds, ma'am!âââYou brute, wou'd I had longer tarried!â ââS'death, ma'am, you never roug'd before we married!â In short, ye men! before ye wed, forbear Of everlasting truth and love to swear; But marriedâfan with care the nuptial flame, Nor think that bear and husband, mean the same! Win us by loveâif that won't do alone, Die! like Sir Johnâand then the day's your own! Ladies! a word to you, and then I've done; A word to tell you what you ought to shun. Shun contradictionâworst of all disastersâ You should be mistressesâbut not be masters! Win by affectionâby persuasion rule: Thus gain your end!âand so I shut up school.</field>
