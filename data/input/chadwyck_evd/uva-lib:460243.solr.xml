      <field name="fulltext">Sequiturque patrem non passibus æquis. Virg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THOMAS KING, Esq; Dear Sir, Your present situation, in which, happily for the professors of the drama, and to the general satisfaction of the public, you have succeeded two of the greatest Geniuses this age has produced, renders the addressing any thing in a dramatic form to you a sort of indispensable propriety; but it is not your situation that exacts this tribute: the esteem, and real affection, I have many years had for yourself, are the only motives which induce me thus publickly to boast the honour of your friendship; to commit the following pages to your protection; to embrace this opportunity of informing those (if there are any) who do not know it, that your private virtues are as eminent as your public merits; and to subscribe myself, With the greatest respect, Dear Sir, Your much obliged, and very humble Servant, The Editor. Jan. 1, 1783.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. Various have been the attempts to copy the style and manner of several of our most celebrated Poets; some of them serious, and others avowedly burlesque. The imitations of Spenser, notwithstanding the objections that have been made to his language and stanza, are remarkably numerous (I have seen near thirty different ones, perhaps there are others I have not met with); and many of them very happily executed. Shakspeare (unless we may except Kenrick's Falstaff's Wedding) has hitherto proved, and it is most likely will continue, inimitable. The pomp of Milton has been as successfully as humourously assumed by Philips; and the Pipe of Tobacco, written in imitation of six several authors, has been universally applauded and admired. But none of these, whether well or indifferently performed, either added to, or diminished, the beauty of their Prototype. The various cantos and small poems written in imitation of Spenser, from Sir Richard Fanshawe, the translator of Il Pastor Fido, and the Lusiad; to Mr. Mickle, who has enriched our libraries with so truly poetical a version of the sublime Camoëns; were never I believe intended to supply the place of any part of the lost, or notwritten Books of the Faerie Queene; the tragedy of Jane Shore, and other professed imitations of our immortal dramatist, were never proposed to be incoporated in any collection or edition of Shakspeare's works: nor do I imagine, though money is so general a succedaneum for happiness, that the Splendid Shilling was ever considered as a supplement to Paradise Lost. The work now submitted to the public stands in a very different predicament from any I have mentioned, or alluded to; for though it can neither help us “to paint the lily,” or “throw a perfume on the violet;” it may, by an humble attendance on, give a consequence to, or by its meanness degrade, the company it has had the temerity to intrude into. Yet is not this arduous attempt to continue and complete the justly-admired Pastoral of the Sad Shepherd arrogantly, but “in trembling hope” annexed to the original Fragment by Jonson; to become, should it be found worthy, his by adoption; or, if “all too mean,” to be rejected, and consigned to its deserved oblivion. The new part of the third act is written, it is presumed, agreeably to the plan laid down in Jonson's argument; which, though he did not finish the dialogue for it, appears to contain all the intended business of that act; the remainder is intirely invented: at least there is no other clue transmitted to us, whereby to guess at the Author's ultimate design, than that Reuben, a devout hermit, in the list of persons, is called, The Reconciler; which I have accordingly made him. I am aware that many passages may be thought unnecessarily long and tedious; some even in the original, would, were it not for their great beauty, be deem'd so: but the piece was never intended by me, whatever it might have been by Jonson, for representation; and we often read with attention and delight a length of monologue or dialogue, that would be insufferable on the stage. The dialect likewise of some of the characters is very uncouth; and not always in the original, as well as copy, correct: in the latter the old Scottish plural, Kie, is twice used in the singular; but it is by the Swine-herd, Lorel, whom we may suppose no very accurate speaker. It may be no improper question to ask, why the Witch, Maudlin, and her family, who are resident near Belvoir Castle, in Leicestershire, are made to speak a Scottish dialect? or, why some of the characters in Jonson's Tale of a Tub, the scene of which was so near London, that it is now almost absorb'd in it, should speak the Somersetshire dialect? To the former I reply, that Scotland seems to have been more particularly the region of witchcraft; I mean the belief in, and imaginary practice of it; which I could cite many proofs of, were it necessary: and it is no unreasonable supposition that Maudlin (admitting the real existence of such a personage) was originally of that country; banished it for her misdeeds, like Shakspeare's Sycorax from Argier; and now settled in a more southern part of the island. Scathlock has something of the same mode of speech; but I am apt to think, upon a revision, the dialect of the county where the scene lies would have been more properly appropriated to him; I have nevertheless continued it as I found it. Jonson has been extremely irregular in his versification in this Pastoral; blank verse and rime being huddled together, with seldom any apparent reason for the mixture or transition. These blemishes, if such I may presume to call them, have been intentionally copied, in the no-doubt-vain endeavour that the whole might appear of a piece. Who cannot copy faults? Dr. Johnson, in his Life of John Philips, very truly says, “Deformity is easily copied.” It is indeed the fate of most imitators to produce unintentionally, except when done in ridicule, a tolerable likeness of nothing else that can be found in, or is attributed to their chosen archetype. The continuator of The Sad Shepherd is sensible how necessary it is to the whole appearing of a piece, that the graces of the parts supplied as well as the defects, should be similar to those of the fragment; but it would be a most egregious and unparalleled self-flattery, were he to hope that beauties, however thinly sown, could be found in the copy, comparable to those we are gratified with in almost every line of the admirable, the delightful original. As Jonson not only made no scruple of borrowing from whoever he thought worthy of that honour, but also recommends the practice, if not servilely done, in his Discoveries; and as his imitations of Theocritus, Spenser, Drayton, &amp;c. are evident in what he has left us of his Pastoral; should similarities to these, or any other Poets be perceived in the continuation; not (to use Ben's words) taken in crude, raw, or indigested; but concocted; the sweets of various flowers worked into honey of one relish and savour; should such imitations appear, it is hoped they will meet the same allowance with those in the original fragment. One passage I must beg particular indulgence for; Æglamour's speech in the third act, on hearing Earine's voice when she sings in the tree, being chiefly borrowed from Jonson himself. In act V. there is a remarkable similitude in the lines beginning with “My coronal composed of, &amp;c.” to part of an Ode by the ingenious Miss Seward, which Ode I believe was not written till after this continuation was finished. Some few liberties have been taken with Jonson's text of the Sad Shepherd, as exhibited in the folio, 1640, and in Mr. Whalley's excellent edition of The Works of Ben Jonson, 1756, but the notes are copied verbatim from Mr. Whalley; which liberty, as well as some others, it is requested of that gentleman to be so good to excuse: whenever therefore, as is sometimes the case, the text and notes disagree, the reason will be found in the supplemental notes, annexed to the continuation; in which the references are made to Mr. Whalley's edition of the Pastoral, and not to the present one. The arguments, though in some places, I think inaccurately written, are given as in the former editions; except the substituting Goblin for Daughter in that of the third Act: which alteration is warranted by Jonson's Dialogue. To the two last acts there are no arguments prefixed; for what purpose could they answer, but the bad one of pre-informing the reader of what he should learn in the gradual progress of the poem? and I am of opinion that Jonson, had he lived to have compleated and published his Sylvan Tale, would have suppressed the three arguments handed down to us. As the matter now stands, it is a happy circumstance that, by the completion of the third argument, we are informed of the Poet's design throughout that act; and it were “a consummation devoutly to be wished,” though the dialogue had been wanting, that we had arguments for the remainder of the Story, as intended by The Maker: the incidents he had, or would have, planned, must (past doubt must) have been productive of much more interesting situations than can be expected in this weak essay to supply his deficience. Should the same observations undesignedly occur here, and in the supplemental notes; the candid reader I am persuaded will think, if they are in any degree worthy his attention, that they had better be mentioned twice than not at all. Mr. Whalley, in his elegantly-pathetic lamentation for the loss of the remainder of Jonson's Pastoral, subjoined to his and the present edition, aptly compares what we have of it to the remains of an ancient piece of sculpture. I will adopt the idea; and in extenuation of the boldness of my undertaking, observe that although part of the celebrated Venus de Medicis is said to be of (comparatively) modern workmanship, and very inferior to that of the antique Statue, to which it is adjoined; yet as, by means of such addition, it now appears without mutilation, and fills the eye and mind with a view and contemplation of a perfect whole; so Jonson's Sad Shepherd having come down to us in nearly the same predicament in which that precious relick of statuary stood, before some venturous hand attempted its completion; I presume to say that however inferiour the modern part now added may, and inevitably must be, to the exquisite fragment we were before possessed of; yet, if executed at all in the manner and spirit of the original, it will give the work at least a seeming perfectness; though ever so short of that perfection, to which “Rare Ben” himself, had he finished it with an untired hand, would certainly have wrought it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Lorel to Maudlin. Maud. Where are you gaang now? Lor. Unto my tree, To see my maistress. Maud. Gang thy gait, and try Thy turns with better luck, or hang thy sel'. [Exit Maudlin. [Here ends Jonson's Fragment.] Lor. Tak ye na' tent, gud mother; I's do well By fair or foul means, Lorel cares na' whilk: But I's begin as mild as new-drawn milk. Now come ye forth once mair, coy lass, and see Gin ye will like or scorn my gifts and me. Gi' me yer hand, as white and soft as wool Of lambs, or down fra 'neath swans' wings we pull: Sae soft a hand suld ha' as soft a heart; But yers is hard as rock—we munna' part. Look, I ha' brought ye wildings fra' the wood, And callow nestlings ta'en while the dam sought food. Ear. Ah, cruel Carle! haste with them back again; Sure thou delight'st in giving all things pain. Lor. Nay, maistress mine! for tho' I pipe fu' well, Fit for thine ear I canno' sing mysel; But ye sall hear these sing, gif ye think meet, Yer praise, deft lass, in chirps and carrols sweet. And here's a gaudy girlond for yer locks, Of zallow sun-flow'rs, and streak'd hollyhocks. Nay, pu' na' sae, ye sall na' that gait gang; Come to yon tedded grass wi' me alang: Or, wi' this osier gyved tul a tree I's use ye rough; then wise and kinder be. Ear. Who can be kind to such a frightful thing? No longer in my ears your vile suit ding. Your form, your face, your manners are uncouth; You need not stare, I tell you but the truth. Unlike the peerless swain, young Æglamour; He is my love, my gentle paramour! No other e'er can please Earine; But least of all mankind, foul Lorel, thee! Lor. Say ye sae, maistress? then, sin' fair words fail, I's try gif foul deeds better will prevail. But wha comes here? sore blisters o' their feet! In to the tree agen!—whan next we meet I's gar ye pay for this—in, scornfu' wretch! Ear. In to my grave with joy to 'scape thy clutch. [Lorel shuts her up in the tree again, and goes out. Clarion enters. Clar. Where hath this love-craz'd shepherd stray'd, I trow? Alas, poor Æglamour! thou 'rt so distraught, I fear thou 'lt plunge into the silver Trent, Hoping to pluck up drown'd Earine; But, 'stead thereof, lose in't thy wretched self! Thrice happy they who know not what is love; For where one shepherd and his true mate find, Like Robin Hood and gentle Marian, Felicity in love, how many pine Like heart-struck Amie, and sad Æglamour, And lovelorn misery for aye endure. [Earine sings in the tree. SONG. “Daughter of Jove! Diana chaste! “Unto a virgin's rescue haste; “And if I never must regain “My loving and beloved swain, “Bright Goddess of the woods and groves, “Pity a maid who purely loves; “And let me, Dian, follow in thy train!” Clar. Whence are those thrilling sweet, and love-sick sounds? Sure 'tis some near-hand shepherdess' soft strain; Yet none can I espy—but hither bends Sad Æglamour— [Æglamour enters hastily. Æg. The ideas, and some of the very words in this speech, are borrowed from Jonson's Epheme. See Vol. VII. of his Works, p. 26 and 27. Whalley's edition, 1756. Earine! where art thou? From hence the voice came, but she is not here; Or, if she is, invisible to me, Enthrall'd in dim-eyed flesh—Earine! I heard thy angel notes above, around; Pleas'd echo still reverberates the sound: Thou 'rt a bright seraph, hymning thy new birth; I a poor worm, still crawling sad on earth. O gentle spright! late rapt to heav'n so high, Still dost thou deign, pure essence! to come nigh Earth's grossness thus? and, for thou see'st us dull, And clogg'd with clay, our souls thou fain would'st pull Forth their frail thralls, by some celestial sleight, And waft them hence to thy own starry height. O, that thou could'st! and that my soul were free To soar, and join the heav'nly choir with thee! It shall be so.—I'll follow thee, bright maid! And be in robes of light like thee array'd! [Æglamour goes out. Clar. Alas, fond Shepherd! more and more distract! [Earine puts her hand through a breach in the tree. But soft! is it a lily that I see, Or something whiter, waving by yon tree? My eyes delude me, or 'tis a fair hand! (Entranc'd with wonder motionless I stand.) With vermeil-tinted finger-tips, it shews Like damask buds, clustring a pallid rose; Some gentle hamadryad dwells within; No mortal hand had e'er so white a skin: If to the touch thou'rt palpable, I'll kiss And court thee in an ectasy of bliss! [As Clarion runs towards the tree a sudden darkness prevents him. 'Tis lost in darkness! sure 'tis witchcraft all! Foul Maudlin holds, I fear, some nymph in thrall; Perchance Earine, we all thought drown'd: O, that she yet may live! and, safely found, Sad Æglamour's pure passion yet be crown'd! I'll seek him first, wise Alken next.—The guest So miss'd and mourn'd may still make glad our feast! [Clarion follows Æglamour. Douce enters. Dou. 'Tis a gay garment this, and fits me well; When first I wore it, I scarce knew mysel. But now I am us'd to 't, troth, I think no more Than what I suld ha' had lang time before. The shepherds doff their bonnets as I pass, And say, bright Be'voir's maids I a' surpass. In a' the forest there is nane sae sheen As dainty Douce; a very greenwood queen! Compar'd wi' me how like a swine's my brother, A' bristled o'er!—but, hush! here comes my mother. [Maudlin and Lorel enter. Maud. Still, lubber Lorel, wo't thou waste thy time To prate and parley wi' a wench in prime? Was't not enow I stock'd her i' the tree, Mun I aye tend a heartless lown like thee? But for the fog I now sae sudden sprad, Yer maistress had bin found by yon trim lad. Albe ye had her safely in yer grip, Ye mak ado as ye were fear'd to clip; 'Twere right e'en o'er yer lugs yer skin to strip! Next time ye ha' her i' yer hands, be sure Ye waste na' time in wards, but do unto her As I ha' tell'd ye. Lor. Stand ye in yon space, I's do it now, 'fore yer and Douce's face. Dou. Troth, I na' like't—gud mother, let me gang; Nor 'bide to see him do the maiden wrang. Maud. Ye need na' budge, daft Douce! it can't be now; My turn mun needs be serv'd ere theirs, I trow. There's other wark in hand—be sure ye keep Her safe lock'd up (without a chink to peep Till ye come back) within the oaken tree— Ye, and yer sister now mun gang wi' me, To gather balefu' simples for strong charms, To wark my safety, and my foemen harms. Dou. Mun I dew-dabble, mother, in these claithes? Let me gang hame, and wrap in fitter swaithes; Nor, like a may-queen prank'd, a simpling go, Lest like a miry muckster I suld shew. Maud. How now! what wards be these? haste! ye were best, Wi' a' yer might, to do yer mother's hest. Sall I by sic a dowdy' as ye be crost, Whan I the dearest thing I had ha' lost? Lor. I's gar her gang bilive, ye need na' fear— But what is't, mother, ye ha' lost sae dear? Maud. My magic girdle, ta'en by Robin Hood, The cursed outlaw king o' this green wood. The spotted pestilence his bow'r surround! Murrains and rots his antled herds confound! His Marian, yeomen, guests, and self in turn Pangs, agues, fevers, rack and shake and burn! Confusion to their meeting! death and dole Attend their feast, and harrow ilka soul! [They go, and Puck re-enters. Puck. I went before you, Dame, but yet am here— Puck can be here, and there, and every where! Whene'er I please a light and nimble Fairy; Anon as sluggish; then I'm call'd Puck-hairy. Those I assist, Robin Good-fellow call Their friend; while those I scare Hobgoblin bawl. I am wicked Maud's tame drudge, because I must; And do her hests, altho' I wish her curst. But when my term is ended, which draws nigh, I'll be the beldam's bitterest enemy. Should Douce turn proud, neglectful of the dairy, She shall be pinch'd and hag-rid by Puck-hairy! Unto my namesake, Robin, and his love, Fair Marian, Robin Good-fellow I'll prove; So will I to his guests in Sherwood bow'r, And all his merrymen: to Lorel sour, I'll be a Will o' the wisp, and oft mislead His wand'ring steps, 'till in a bog he tread; Scare him sometimes in shape of wolf or bear, O'er thorns and briars, his brutal flesh to tear. But now to Maud—she hath not yet got far; I'll overtake her like a glancing star! SCENE changes to Robin Hood's bower; Amie reclining on a seat of turf; Marian and Mellifleur standing on each side of her. Am. No, no, you flatter me, sweet Mellifleur; And you but mock me, Marian, by my troth: He will not come, alas! he's gone to fish In Trent's clear stream, where his lov'd sister lies A prey to those he in revenge shall hook. But do not touch the finny cannibals, If he should bring them caught, tho' e'er so pure And tempting they appear: 'tis with the flesh, The gorged flesh of drown'd Earine. Mar. See, gentle Amie, where kind Karol comes, With jolly Robin Hood, who blithsome looks; Chear up, sweet maid, there's comfort yet in store. Mel. The courteous Lionel comes with them too. 'Would he were coming Mellifleur to wooe! [Aside. Robin Hood, Karolin, and Lionel enter. Rob. Here, my bright Marian, is the magic band, With which the hag was girded, when, like you As drop to drop of water, I laid hold, And forc'd her take her own foul shape again: Now is the mystery clear that caus'd our broil; The only one our loves did e'er yet soil: Which nothing short of witchcraft could have done; Nor shall that more while our lives' currents run. Mar. If my lov'd Robin's satisfied, I'm blest; And thank each chance makes me by thee carest! Light griefs make after-joys more bright appear, As clouds dispers'd still shew the heav'ns more clear. But here's a gentle maid demands our care; Tender as buds, as new-blown lilies fair; Drooping with love, and withering with despair. Kar. Kind Marian, by your leave; let me desire But you, and gallant Robin to retire, With courteous Lionel and Mellifleur; I will attempt the love-sick maiden's cure. Rob. Come then, my Marian, let us see all's set In order for our feast; I am in thy debt A countless sum of kisses for what's past. Mar. I would the payment might for ever last! [Robin and Marian retire. Lio. Robin and Marian kindly both withdraw, To give my sister and young Karol law. Each dove hath got its mate but you and I; Shall we, sweet Mellifleur, at courtship try? I' th' rose-and-myrtle grove let us go walk; And, tho' we wooe not, have some pleasant talk. Mel. Each word and look from you I hear and see, Might serve for wooing a soft maid like me. [Lionel leads Mellifleur out Karoline and Amie remain. Kar. What ails thee, gentle Amie? what's thy grief? Look up, sad maid! I come to bring relief; What I have gather'd since I have been away, Shall haply be the means thy grief to stay; Thou lov'st a swain term'd kind; ah! sure he ne'er Can but be kind to one so passing fair! One beauteous Virgin of the guests is gone, My drowned sister! woe enough alone! Let not another droop, whom aught can save From a worse fate, a cold and love-lorn grave! Wilt thou permit me, dearest! to apply What I think meet, in hope of remedy? No answer, Amie? silence is consent; To press my lips to thine is what I meant. I'll do it chastely as I were thy brother. [Kisses her. Have I not, sweet! thou'lt not refuse another? [Kisses her. The Shepherds say my kissing pleas'd you so, That lack of more hath caus'd this loving woe: You prais'd my voice, they say, and chaunted strain; Will Amie hear her Karol sing again? SONG. “How sweet the breath of milky kine, “And lambkins in the fold; “How sweet the air bland gales refine “On upland heath or wold: “How sweet the scent of new-mown hay, “And early-blossom'd grove: “But sweeter than the breath of May “The balmy breath of love! “How sweet the shepherd's pipe of oat, “Which dawn of day doth hail; “How sweet the merry milk-maid's note “When seated by her pail: “How sweet the song of lark and thrush, “Or voice of cooing dove; “But sweeter 'neath a hawthorn bush, “The votive voice of love!” 'Tis an old saw, “Pity is kin to Love.” That it is true what I now feel doth prove. [Aside. How is my gentle Amie? speak, dear maid! Thy love to Karolin's with love repaid. [Kisses her. Am. Oh, I'm in Heav'n, kind Karol! where's my pain? 'Twas in my heart but now; 'tis gone again! Oh, magic touch! thy lips have chas'd all smart, Warm'd my chill veins, and eas'd my love-sick heart. Oh, Karolin! sweet Karolin! dear life! Wilt thou accept fond Amie for thy wife? In faith I love thee! and, tho' maids should hide Such wishes, wish I were kind Karol's bride. Kar. I'll plight my troth to thee, but cannot wed Sweet Amie, while in Trent's cold watry bed My sister lies; poor, drown'd Earine! Her beauteous body first I'll thence set free, And lay beneath a holy turf to rest; Then will we wed, and, blessing, each be blest! [Exeunt Karolin and Amie. The SCENE changes to a wild part of the Forest. John, Scarlet, Scathlock, and George, enter. John. This way she went e'en now, and like a hare, But swifter. Scar. No, no; it can never be— I'll not believe she so could cheat our eyes, To make us think, while we all look'd on her, We only saw a weak and timorous hare. What think you, George? was it old Maud, or no? George. I know not what to think, but this I know; Soon as we saw the witch, John blew his horn, When suddenly she took her to that brake Whence sprang what ye have all now run in view; And while you three pursued the hare-like hag, Each bush around I beat for her in vain. Scat. Troth ye mak mony words, fools as ye are, To stand here splottering till ye lose yer game; 'Twas Maudlin, the curst crone, ye mar our sport. [Alken enters to them. Alk. Well overtaken, friends! I'm out of breath! But I have seen from yon o'erhanging hill, (Whither I went to get protecting herbs) The various process of the witch's wiles, And her familiar's pranks, the goblin Puck; Who, tho' he still, perforce, assists the hag, Hath done her sordid son each spiteful turn, As with his sister, Douce, he rang'd around Through fenny flats, in search of baleful weeds. Unto the witch's dimble all are gone; Foul Maudlin; Douce; and Lorel, scar'd by Puck: Let us too hasten to the hag's dark dell; My life upon't our hunt shall yet end well. [Exeunt Alken and the Woodmen. The SCENE changes to the Witch's Dimble. Maudlin is seen with her Spindle, Images, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Maud. Here am I safe—were Douce and Lorel come, I'd wark a charm suld strike the curst crew dumb. For their affronts I's mak 'em pay fu' dear, And homage me, tho' not for love, through fear. The huntsmen canno', gif they track my way, Be here as yet, mak a' the speed they may— Now for my thred, pins, images of wax, To wark them torments wairs than whips or racks. [She spins and sings. “Around my wheel; around, around! “As fast as foot-board strikes the ground, “And keep my spindle turning; “I's quickly twine a various thred “Of black and yellow, blue and red: “Then, as their types are burning, “Prick'd through wi pins o' rusted steel, “Their lives' line running round the reel, “My foes wi' pangs be girning!” [She continues preparing her magical operations. Alken, John, George, Scarlet, and Scathlock enter. Alk. See where she sits, foul hag! her shape resum'd, In her drear fourm, chaunting some uncouth spell. Hold fast your vervain, dill, and misletoe; So shall you safe and all-unseen remain, Till we may work the wicked beldam's thrall. Scat. Sal I lay grip upo' the wily witch? Alk. No; wait with patience till her charms are done, Which cannot hurt as I have counterwork'd; Then will we seize her, naked of defence. Maud. Here come my bairns, well stor'd wi' wicked herbs; The spurs to evil, and o' gud the curbs. [Douce and Lorel enter. Now quick relate what ye ha' carefu' sought. What ha' ye mist? what ha' ye heedfu' brought? Lorel's o'er-breath'd; say what ha' ye, first, Douce? Dou. Wi' a canker'd herdsman soon as I made truce, I got some wool fra' a coal-black lamb's back. Maud. Out, dunce! it is the blood, not wool, I lack. What ha' ye else? produce a' in a crack. Dou. I ha' brought besides each harmfu' plant ye use, Whan mankind or their beasts ye wald abuse. False-smiling crow-foot, savin, and snake-root; Moon-wort, and bane-wort, wolf and hen-bane both; Either to lack methought ye wald be loth— Hemlock, and deadly-night-shade; cypress; yew; Which, as ye see, a' dropping poisonous dew, O'er the dank grave of a self-murderer grew. Maud. These are but nosegays to my venom'd spite. Now, Lorel, say, on what did ye alight? Lor. By some thwart fiend I was misled and scared, Sae in my errand I but scantly fared; And only here and there pick'd up a bit. Here's snake-weed, paddock-rude, and cuckow-spit; An unbroke bag of vipers; slow-worm; newt; An o'ergorg'd spider; rat's-tail; swan's black foot. And see too, mother, what I (lucky) found— A jellied star, dropt yesternight to ground— I guess'd it might be potent in yer craft, Sae brought it; tho' my sister at me laught. I spied an adder sucking o' kie 's teat Kie is here intended to mean cow, in the singular; but it is really the old plural, being only a variation of dialect for kine, cows.; I pu'd it thrice by th' tail, but 'twoud na' quit— I cut off's head which still clung fast to suck, And brought the body to ye: but, best luck! Sprad in a spongy fungus' fewmand shade, This swoll'n and speckle-bellied toad was laid, Surcharg'd wi' venom, whilk his bowels brast, And on his back the ranc'rous reptile cast. A' these I ha' brought ye, mother; and had more, But that some fiend (I tell'd ye) scared me sore. Maud. Ye 'are daft as Douce, what fiend I trow suld scare My bairns, when potent Maud and Puck are near? Now hie ye hence awhile, nor view mine art; Nae further in my witcheries ye bear part. Lor. I's to my tree agen; gif stubborn still I find the lass, I's force her to my will. Dou. And I's gae proyn me new, wi' mickle pains, Then proudly prance amang the shepherd swains. [Lorel and Douce depart. Maud. Ho! goblin Puck! come at yer dame's desire. Puck enters. Puck. Here I am, dame! what now doth Maud require? My service almost draweth to an end— In what shall Puck his last assistance lend? Maud. This is nae time to talk—fa' to, stout drudge! And aid yer mistress wreak the rankled grudge She bears to Robin Out-law, and his crew— Scathlock first anger'd me, he first sal rue! Here are the images of a' my foes; What's done to them sal cause their like like woes. For taking back the venison, (come! begin!) Into the heart of Scathlock run this pin. Scat. Hold, damned hell-cat! or, wi'sharpen'd knife, I's rid the warld o' sic a sinfu' life! Maud. Whase voice is that? help, Puck! my spells are cross'd! Puck. Hence, dame! forego your purpose, or you're lost! Your foes are here invisible; aroint! Their scheme to trap you now I'll disappoint. Which service ends my thraldom! vanish strait; Leaving your shade whereon to wreak their hate. Maud. Now then I go. Puck. Rise, shadow! substance, down! Maud. The witch's curse remain! hang, stab, or drown! [Puck and Maudlin sink with a strange noise; a phantom like the witch rises in her stead, grinning at the huntsmen: they strike at it, and it disappears, leaving them in confusion. Scat. Where's Maud? John. She sunk! Scar. She 'rose again! Geo. She's gone! Alk. Oh, your impatience has my scheme o'erthrown! If you had silent waited till each charm She' had, harmless, practis'd, nor giv'n this alarm; We should have ta'en her, maugre all her art, And strait consign'd her to the pool or cart! But o'er her goblin since she' hath no more pow'r, I'll end her witcheries this very hour. Come, let's about it, ere the day grow late; Then to our friends this magic tale relate. [Exeunt. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Robin, Marian, Lionel, and Mellifleur enter, meeting Karolin and Amie. Rob. Welcome once more, thou gentle, love-sick maid! Welcome, kind Karolin! most rightly nam'd I see by Amie's love-delighted eye. Sure such a threave of mildly-moulded swains In blissful Arcady did never dwell! Let us not then repine, for we are plac'd In Albion's colder clime; not all the frost Her icyest winters glaze our streams withal, Hath pow'r to chill the bosom of her sons; Wherein love's fire maintains such constant heat, That an eternal fervid summer reigns! Kar. So much I feel its force, while this fair sun Sheds her bright beams, infusing kindly warmth, Nor age nor winter e'er can freeze my veins; But youth and spring-time, ever fresh and new, Shall keep my love still in its bud and bloom! Mar. You need no tongue t'interpret for your eyes; Yet say, fond Amie, art thou bless'd indeed? Am. So bless'd, so highly bless'd, oh Marian! That to be queen of all the region round, Or the whole peopled world, were bliss far short Of the possessing kindest Karol's love! Rob. Fairly confess'd; may you be ever thus! And all that visit this my greenwood bower! Hither I came, foregoing pomp and state, In search of happiness so rarely found. Here in these sylvan shades (oh blissful seat!) Unenvied and unenvying, we abide The change of seasons, and the lapse of time; For healthful exercise, and needful food, Through merry Sherwood chase the noble hart: When from his lair, beneath a brake of vert, Unharbour'd first by Scathlock, or stout John, Sudden he'll bound, he'll fly; ascend the hill, Descend (that gain'd) the dale; now stop, look back, And list if he's secure: the bugle sounds; Again like wind he fleets, as fleet the hounds Pursue; they strain, they pant; till, nearly spent, We slip our strong relays: then what a sound, When in full cry the treble, counter, base O' th' tuneful pack, in perfect harmony, Ring through the azure vault of smiling heav'n! Whose echo with the concert keeps true time; While the spheres listen to the envied chime! Lio. Renowned hunter! gallant Robin Hood! Thy bow'r, thy sports, thy manners please so well, A bowman with thee, I, content, could dwell! Mel. Ah me! is this the love I fondly dream'd He bare to me? 'would it had not so seem'd! Mar. Sweet Mellifleur, why heaves that heart-fetch'd sigh? Amie looks cheerly, thou as thou would'st die; Thou'rt love or planet-struck now; how's the moon? Mel. Ah me! I fear that I shall sudden swoon! Kar. Lead her forth, shepherd, into other air; And courteous Lionel, a word i' your ear. Apply your lips to hers, be not afraid; So was your sister cur'd, so may this maid. [Lionel leads Mellifleur out. Rob. 'Tis as it should be! every man his mate; 'Twill make our festival the more compleat. Were Clarion return'd, and the sad swain, Craz'd Æglamour, but his right self again, We'd strive forget the shepherdess' late loss I' th' swollen Trent, she strove in vain to cross! Mar. Look! look! grant heav'n my dazzled eyes see true! Nor that her loss a second time I rue. See where Earine, or else her ghost Approaches, Robin! sure she was not lost. [Earine enters, conducted by Alken, John, Scarlet, Scathlock, and George. It is herself!—this hand is flesh and blood— Prais'd be the Gods for this unhop'd-for good! Welcome our mourn'd-for-dead, but living guest. Rob. Welcome, most beauteous maiden, to our feast! Now shall thy faithful Æglamour be blest. Kar. O my lov'd sister! do I once more clasp, Thy living body in these folding arms! Am. O joyful sight! now will kind Karol wed. Ear. My Karolin! my brother! and good friends! Where is my Æglamour? my dearest love! Does he yet think on his Earine? Rob. On nothing else, fair maid! and for thy loss, Drown'd, as we fancied, in the Trent's swift stream, He wanders up and down, all woe-begone; Of sense, almost of life for thee bereft! But Clarion, who doth careful 'tend his steps, Shall strait conduct him to this blissful bow'r; And soon restore his wits, restoring thee. But say, Earine, where were you hid? And to what chance owe we your presence now? Ear. Please you to speak, brave bowman! and inform From what a dreary prison, and worse dread, Thy prowess freed me. John. Pardon me, fair maid! The tale befits not me; some other speak— Scathlock, George, Scarlet— Scat. Nay, I's first be hang'd! Geo. It fits not us to talk. Scar. We were sore bang'd! Rob. Speak, Alken, then, of all you know hath happ'd. Alk. First let me briefly tell, we chas'd the witch, Old Maudlin, in the shape of a fleet hare, E'en to her fourm; and there had taken her, But for our over-eagerness of sport, Which scared her 'midst her spells and charms; whereon She and her goblin hastily took flight, And left us all-bewilder'd and amaz'd. Returning hither we beheld this maid Dragg'd forth a hollow'd tree, by that coarse carle Lewd Lorel, bestial as the swine he feeds; While with pure prayers the spotless virgin call'd On Heav'n to shield that honour he assail'd. Who, that humanity or love e'er knew, Beauty distrest from aiding could refrain! First Scathlock, with his stout and knotty staff, Aiming a blow, the lubber loud 'gan laugh; Strait from his ribs resounded Scathlock's stroke; But, by ill luck, his staff, tho' plant of oak, Snapp'd short: the huntsman thus soon foil'd, retired, As lightning swift, with indignation fir'd, Scarlet flew at him; but, tho' brave and strong, The conflict 'twixt them lasted not o'er long; Tripp'd by a stubbed thorn flat on his face, Lorel exulted in th' unearn'd disgrace. Nor better fared stout George, for on the ground (Tho' us'd by dint of strength to pin and pound) Hurl'd by the huge hulk, weltering was he found! I trembled for the maiden! three were quell'd; But one remain'd, fit match; me, feeble eld Forbade to hope, altho' my heart were good, To conquer him who three men's conqueror stood. With scornful grin now Lorel John attacks; Then what a rattling peal of thumps and thwacks! The maiden wail'd; I pray'd; they stoutly fought; Victory was neuter long, by both hard sought. At length the pursy swine-herd blows for breath; Yet meditates, by art, thy bowman's death: Draws forth the knife with which he kills his swine, And aims it in the grapple at John's chine— Heav'n gave me strength to wrest it from his grip; Now John, quoth I, let not this moment slip! No sooner said than done; John rais'd him high, Then downward dash'd him; wallowing he doth lie In his own blood, with horrible outcry. The maid deliver'd, hither soon we came— Tho' John the praise won, let none else have blame; To be well conquer'd is, I trow, no shame. Rob. Well hast thou told the tale, wise Alken! John, May'st thou to conquer ever thus go on! And for this victory at our feast be seen, Deck'd with a coronal of laurel green! Cheer up, brave fellows! nor let this dismay; You may have better luck another day: Bathe all your bruises in my healing well, So shall your wounds not fester, or limbs swell; Then broach a cask o' th' best, and 'swage your thirst; Fighting's hot work—drink deep—but John drink first! John. Not this time, master, I deserve no praise; But for sage Alken ended were my days. Geo. I ne'er was beat before so, by the mass! Scar. I'm a meer jelly! Scat. I a cudgel'd ass! [John, George, Scarlet, and Scathlock go out. Kar. How the stout woodmen grieve for their mischance! Rob. They are so us'd to quell all dare oppose They hardly brook this single vanquishment. Mar. Old Maud, then, clearly hath escap'd? Alk. Not so. Somewhat remains untold—between the tree Confin'd the maid, and this gay greenwood-bow'r, From an o'er-brambled gap in a rude crag, As we were posting hither, with surprize We saw crawl out the beldam late had sunk I' th' earth, attended by her quondam hind; Who spake these words, and instant disappear'd. “My term's expir'd, my service done; “Foul dame, with joy from thee I run!” I seiz'd the moment she was unprepar'd, By aiding fiend, or charms, to make defence; And round her shrivell'd neck an amulet fix'd, (Nought but repentance and pure prayers can loose) That by its hidden virtue will prevent The unwitch'd hag from working future scathe. Rob. In all things well and wisely hast thou done. But why comes Mellifleur in tears, I trow? Will Lionel no kindness to her shew? Mellifleur enters. Mel. Mourn, mourn, you gentle train! now all is done. Forth from this festal unto dark shades run, And wail the woful'st chance our plains e'er knew! Mar. What chance, sweet maid? say what, and whence it grew? Mel. When late young Lionel, the courteous swain, Hence led me to repeat an amorous strain; From Trent-ward o'er the meads at distance we Beheld a shepherd, bearing o'er the lea A drowned corse; when Lionel swift ran, To help the living bear the lifeless man, Dead Æglamour! Ear. Ha! dead! Mel. Earine! Is't her, or is't her shade, I wond'ring see? If her thou art, in vain he sought that death By which he deem'd his love was reft of breath; In vain he plung'd him in that watry bed; In vain thou live'st, since he, alas, is dead! Mar. Lo, where the gentle shepherds, sad and slow, Bear the cold corse! doth this a festal shew? Kar. My almost brother dead! Am. And mine! Alk. Poor youth! Thou diest a martyr to thy love and truth. Rob. Ill-fated shepherd! in that moment drown'd, When all thy wishes were so nearly crown'd; Our festival thou'st to a funeral turn'd! Ear. Break, break, poor heart! soon as thy dead love's mourn'd. [Clarion and Lionel enter, bearing Æglamour. Clar. Behold, lamenting friends!—and oh, sweet maid! I almost hoped did live—by death low laid The pride of Be'voir vale! Lio. And dost thou live, Earine! thy true love's death to grieve? Rob. Tell briefly, either shepherd, that knows best, How chanc'd his fate, then bear him to his rest. Clar. Th'unhappy youth late heard a sweet voice sing He thought Earine's; strait to the spring That, circling, rises in the midst of Trent, With fleeting haste to drown with her he went; Thinking her spirit hover'd in the air, Waiting till his from mortal bonds was clear. I follow'd him, and gain'd the rivers brink Just as he plung'd; these eyes beheld him sink! Soon he arose; as soon he sank again, Mutt'ring Earine! with stifled pain: A second time, but further from the shore, He 'rose; Earin! groan'd—I heard no more— The eddying water whirl'd him once more down; I stood the while aghast—a man of stone! As heav'n ordain'd, a third time did he rise, Speechless and senseless! with distracted cries I sprang so near him, that I caught him fast, As he was sinking; and with utmost haste Swam with my death-like load unto the shore; Used every means I hoped might life restore; But, failing, hither strait the body bore. Rob. Thy pains commend thee, shepherd, tho' in vain; As well i'th' water might he still have lain; For he is gone, ne'er to revive again! Ear. No, I'll not weep! I'll follow calm his bier, Then die upon his grave without a tear! Rob. Within, ho! all whom life and health permit Come forth, to bear this corse in order fit; Bring too your bugles; and, good Friar, lend Your pious aid, while sadly we attend, To' inter this dust near holy Reuben's cell; Th'immortal part is flown with saints to dwell! So!—wind his Mort, with slow and solemn sound; And sing his Dirge, as we pace toward the ground! [The Friar, &amp;c. having come forth, they carry off Æglamour, singing his Dirge. Dir. The chase is o'er, the hart is slain! The gentlest hart that grac'd the plain; With breath of bugles found his knell, Then lay him low in death's drear dell! Nor beauteous form, nor dappled hide, Nor branchy head will long abide; Nor fleetest foot that scuds the heath, Can 'scape the fleeter huntsman, death. The hart is slain! his faithful deer, In spite of hounds or huntsman near, Despising death, and all his train, Laments her hart untimely slain! The chase is o'er, the hart is slain! The gentlest hart that grac'd the plain; Blow soft your bugles, sound his knell, Then lay him low in death's drear dell! Puck enters. Puck. My penance done, my toilsome bondage past, In which, for impure pranks, I erst was cast, I am free as air! releas'd from Maud's curst thrall; Who from her height of power full low doth fall— Wounded by adders, hissing all around, The beldam lies; with a strong amulet bound From harming, or subduing man or beast. Now would I frolick fain at Robin's feast; But with the drowned shepherd's fate 'tis marr'd: Pity such love should ever be ill-star'd! And yet, perchance, the swain is not quite dead; Methought a gleam of lightning hither sped! There did! sure token heaven hath bliss in store, And will revive again young Æglamour! No more a witch's goblin and Puck-hairy, But mankind's friend, a pure and gentle fairy, The mourning throng invisible I'll join; And, if the least remains of breath divine Infused at first creation, unperceiv'd By mortal senses, (I can't be deceiv'd) I'll shoot from pole to pole, pervade the skies For every aid that in immortals lies, Till he to life, Earine, and bliss arise! [Exit. SCENE, Lorel's Oak. Lorel lying on the ground. Lor. Oh! I sal ne'er get up again! my bones Are broken sure! and I am all o'er bruis'd, As though ten threshers had belabour'd me Wi' their stout flails, and beat me to mere chaff! They have ta'en my maistress tu! (that's warst of all) Though for my mother's help I loud 'gan bawl. Why wald she let 'em? I remember when A dark'ning fog she rais'd; and why not then? And why not come to help me? by her art I suld be heal'd bilive of my sair smart. Douce enters. Oh, Douce! kind sister! see where Lorel lies, Lend me thy help while fra' the earth I rise! Dou. Ah, Lorel! brother! what hath hap'd to thee? My turn is next sure! nought but misery Can I expect, wi' nought to shield fra' harms; Nor Lorel's strength, nor Maudlin's potent charms. Our mother's witchcraft arts are from her flown; I found her helpless, making piteous moan, A' stung wi' adders, sought to mak a spell: For cure I led her to the healing-well Of Robin Hood; fra' which with pain I drew Water for the 'nonce: then search'd for thee around, To bear her home when she has 'swaged each wound. Lor. Gi' me yer hand, Douce; gently! gently! sae; Gif I can walk I's to my mother gae, To crave her counsel how to quell the foes, Wha stole my maistress hence, and ga' me blows! Dou. Whate'er your scathe, or by whoever done, To seek revenge may bring on future ills; Gud canna' spring fra' evil plain is seen, And evil, tho' compell'd, the doer harms! I ne'er did ill but by my mother forc'd, To aid her arts; yet was I thereby hurt. This garment of Earine's she gave, And bade me wear, did mak me proud o'heart; Pride's a great sin; but pale revenge is wairs! I ha' thrown off pride, as I will this gay garb Soon as I find the maid escap'd yer tree; Do ye foregae revenge: a rancrous heart Still i' the end doth punish most itsel. Our mother's witchcraft o'er, she can't compel Us now to evil; let us, Lorel, strive (Sae will yer herds, yer sel, and kindred thrive) Which can excell in gud, as erst in ill; Brother, I counsel ye, fra' right gud will! Lor. Well! lead to Maudlin, while I am in the muid, Wairs I can't thrive suld I turn e'er sae gud! [Exeunt. SCENE, Robin Hood's Well. Maudlin, sitting by the well, bathing her wounds. Maud. Still mun I bear this torment, wairs than death; Which I wald willing meet to 'scape sic pangs! Tho' I ha' shook the poisonous reptiles off That clung around my limbs, deaf to my wails As heav'n or hell, (both oft in vain invok'd) Yet hath their venom rankled sae my veins, That e'en this wond'rous well can nought avail To gi' me ease, and heal the serpents' wounds: My charms ha' pow'r nae mair, my spirit's flown; And I can only curse, or faintly pray. Lorel and Douce enter. Lor. How fare ye, mother? are ye wounded sair? I am sair bruis'd, and ha' my maistress lost; A' things gae cross, I think, to wark us ill; I wanted yer help; ye, meseems, lack mine. Dou. How now, dear mother? are yer pains yet gone? Maud. Oh, no! kind Douce! they harrow e'en my soul! I am sae curst, this till-now-healing well, Doth but encrease the pangs it else wald cure. Lor. Troth, mother, I ha' oft heard say, that seld It helps the wicked; never a foul witch! Maud. Out on thee, limmer! what vild wards are these? Oh! oh! again the poison shoots, and stings, And bites, and gnaws, as it wald eat my heart! What sal I do for ease, dear daughter Douce? Dou. Alas! gud mother! wald that I could tell! Lorel is used to cope wi' a' the brood O' snakes and taids, in tending o' his herds; He better kens than I. Maud. Again they pang! Speak ye bilive, rude Lorel, what did ye Whan sic like reptiles harm'd yer swine and kie? And gif ye ha' love or pitydo't to me! Lor. Whan cleft-tongued adders stung my bristled swine, I still ha' used to kill the hurten beasts; Sal we kill ye? or will ye bide in pain? I ha' lost my knife!—gif, mother, ye will die, Lend me yer blade or bodkin for the stroke. Dou. Shame on thee, lown! gi' o'er sic uncouch speech. Maud. Ha'ye nae greater feeling? swineherd! brute! But wald ye slay your mother, thus oppress'd? Bestir yer lubber limbs, less hurt than mine, And help me to the haly hermit's cell; Reuben is kind and skilfu'!—thanks, dear Douce. Ha' mercy, heav'n! I'll hence forsake my craft, My wiles, my witcheries, and turn to gud; Sae may the ev'ning o' my life be blest, Sae, whan I die, my soul in heav'n may rest! [Lorel and Douce lead Maudlin out. SCENE, the Entrance to a Hermit's Cell. Reuben, a devout Hermit, enters. Reub. Blest be the hour I left, for this abode, The gaudy world! here, dedicate to heaven, I pass the evening of my well-spent days; Free from tumultuous cares, fraud, pain, and strife. Here, from my beechen bowl, I drink the stream That, smooth meand'ring, circumscribes my cell; From cleanly trencher frugal viands eat; Fresh herbs, stor'd pulse, plants, fruit, or esculent roots, Clad in coarse frieze I feel not winter's cold, Which oft-time makes the silk-rob'd worldling shrink; And in this shade, where airy zephyrs dwell, Am far more free from summer's heat, than those Who pant beneath a proud and gilded dome. The mat I wove of rushes, from the brink Of the near brook, that prattling glides away, My nightly couch; whereon, by soft content And gentle peace embrac'd, I sweetly sleep; And, ere the day unclose his golden eye, Waking, pour forth my pure heart's orisons; Then range the dewy meads for heav'n-sent herbs, Of foodful use, or medicinal power; For self-support, or any need my aid. Thus do I keep my sear leaf ting'd with green; And thus still serving God and man am seen! But cease, my pleasance; hither bends a train Of nymphs and shepherds, sadly o'er the plain. [Part of the Dirge is heard repeated at a distance. “The chase is o'er, the hart is slain, “The gentlest hart that grac'd the plain; “With breath of bugles sound his knell, “Then lay him low in death's drear dell.” [Robin Hood, Marian, Friar Tuck, the Shepherds, Shepherdesses, and woodmen (bearing Æglamour) enter in solemn procession. Reub. What's here? what's here? a shepherd's drowned corse! Young Æglamour, the virtuous! worse and worse! He that came daily, hourly to my cell, And by my counsel fram'd his life so well, In goodness as in comeliness t' excell! But vain is praise now—bear him gently in. [They carry Æglamour into the cell; Marian and the Sheperdesses following, are prevented by Reuben. Let no more follow! th'air must be kept thin, And while we try our utmost skill and pow'r Again his respiration to restore, Ye females to yon holy grove repair; There kneel, and heaven implore with hymn and prayer, If he yet lives his guiltless life to spare. [Reuben goes into the cell, the women remain. Ear. What said the reverend man? is he not dead? A clay-cold corse upon the bier laid! Why have they ta'en him hence? ah, why deprive Me of him the few moments I am alive! My heart soon breaking, we'll together go, Wedded in death, to our bridal bed full low! Mar. Peace, sad Earine! with us along; And heaven address in prayer, and holy song. Reuben spoke comfort; heaven may yet restore The youth who now, like thee, we all deplore! Mel. Come, lovely mourner! to the holy fane. Am. Come, beauteous maid! nor be thy prayers vain. Ear. Lead on, good Marian; and, kind-hearted maids, T' implore high heaven lend your pious aids; Haste we to fervent prayer i' th' holy grove— This veil of death, ye sacred powers, remove, And raise the youth again to life and love! [Earine, Marian, &amp;c. go to the Grove. Friar Tuck and the Woodmen return from the Cell. Tuck. Come, my good fellows all, obey the hest Of holy Reuben; and, behind this cell Prepare a peaceful grave, I'll consecrate, Should life be flown past power of calling back, For the drown'd shepherd; leaving, the mean time, The hermit, with your master, Robin Hood, And the kind shepherd-swains, t' assay restore To life again the mourned Æglamour. Which should he not effect, 'tis best (he said) With all dispatch he in the earth be laid; Hid from the sight of the lamenting maid. John. Why, do you think it possible, good Friar, Reuben should bring the dead to life again? Geo. Ah, John, that never can be done, I fear. Scar. An't can, the good old hermit sure will do't. Scat. An' gif he does, he's a gud man indeed. Tuck. He is, indeed! a good, a holy man! No world-chas'd libertine, compell'd to fly To unlov'd solitude for life ill spent; No sour, unsocial, man detester, he, Secluded in a lone austerity; Thinking to purchase heaven by abstinence From what heaven sent, for mankind's moderate use; Mortification; penance; and a train Of visionary superstition's bribes For that, which nought but a pure heart can gain: Reuben is none of these; devoutly vow'd To heaven and God, he's still the friend of man: Delighting in humanity's mild deeds, His each humane endeavour still succeeds! John. You think, then, father Tuck, he'll raise the swain? Scat. Gif so, why suld we dig a needless grave? Tuck. Grudge not that little labour; should it prove A needless one, I think you'll not repine: So do it for the reason Reuben gave.— To say he certainly will raise the swain, Because himself is holy, is not fit; Vainly might I as well presume to say, You still must conquer for that you are strong: Nothing we know's impossible to God! He, if he please, may grant the good man's prayer, Bestow a blessing on his pains and skill, And raise the youth again, now seeming dead; Who, without pains, and skill, and prayers to heaven, And heaven's blessing giv'n, were dead indeed! But that a miracle should e'er be work'd To interrupt great nature's settled course, And give a second life to one quite dead, (Unless t' accomplish the designs of God!) Were childish to expect; weak to believe; And derogates from heaven's wise providence! John. Thanks, gentle friar! you have, as you are wont, Expounded to us all so plain and clear, A child might understand. I have heard divines At Wakefield, Hereford, and Nottingham, So preach, perplex and pother with a text; That not their hearers only, wise or learn'd, But e'en themselves were so bewilder'd oft, They seem'd like men lost in a labyrinth's maze; And stray'd the more, the more they strove t' escape (Wanting the clue of sense to guide them right) The intricate, obscure, and puzzling path. Scat. Mass! John, that's true; and therefore seld went I To church to hear what none could understand. Scar. Come then; now father Tuck has well explain'd These matters, let's about the shepherd's grave. Geo. May heaven and Reuben's skill him from it save! Tuck. Hold; hither come the wicked beldam, Maud; Her son, and daughter; what brings them here trow? Scat. Were she but still a witch, (for Alken says Her cursed craft is done, her goblin flown) Suld a' means fail gud Reuben sal essay, She might ca' back the dead man's sprite wi' charms. Tuck. No, Scathlock, no! think not those leagued with hell Can e'er that good atchieve, which pious prayers And heaven's high pleasure do not bring to pass. Maudlin, Douce, and Lorel enter. Lor. Mother, gae back! for yonder's little John, Wha sae belabour'd me I scant can crawl; Belike again he'll beat me gif I stay! Maud. See ye na' father Tuck? nae harm can hap While he is present—On her knees, gud friar, Behold a wretched eld, whase wicked life Has made her th'outcast and the hate o' th' warld: Forgi' me, haly friar! and ye, gud men, Wham I ha' oft offended, oh, forgi' A helpless, harmless, and repentant wretch, Wha ne'er will injure ye or yer's agen! Tuck. If, as you say, you do repent your crimes, And ne'er will practise your vile arts again, I'll answer for these honest-hearted men, As well as for myself, your pardon strait. But say, what brings you here? we are busy now. And, oh! (I grieve t' upbraid, forgiveness pass'd.) You were the cause of what employs our cares! Had not rude Lorel, aided by your arts, Conceal'd Earine, young Æglamour, Who thought her dead, had not now lain a corse, A drowned corse, in holy Reuben's cell. Dou. O piteous tidings! is the shepherd drown'd! Maud. Ha' mercy, heaven! nor let the innocent's death Be added to my countless, heinous crimes! Haste me, an't be yer will, gud reverend friar! To where he lies. Tho' I ha' left my arts, My wicked anes, yet I possess gud skill, And knowledge in what's fitting to be done In sic like scathes; O, let me help atone, Gif in my power, for my ill-doing past: Perchance the haly hermit then will try, To gar the pangs I now endure to cease; And I my better days may end in peace! Tuck. If thou 'rt sincere, come with me to the cell; Meantime, good fellows, do as was desir'd: That, if all pains, and skill, and prayers should fail To raise the youth; according to the hest Of holy Reuben he be laid to rest! [Friar Tuck and Maudlin go into the cell. Lor. Come, Douce, wi' me, I am afeard to stay, Bruis'd as I am, t' endure another fray; Suld John there force me wi' him now to fight, Like Æglamour I's bid the warld gud night! Dou. I's gae lest they suld wreak on me their spite. [Lorel and Douce go out. Scat. The sturdy Lorel scouls, and gangs his gate; He fears to bide, and swagger, as o' late. John. 'Tis a mere savage, and beneath our thought; Come, now let's to our task; and, ere 'tis wrought, Good Reuben's heaven-bless'd skill I pray make vain, Our labour, by reviving the young swain! [Exeunt. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE a Grove, with an Altar. Earine, Marian, Amie, and Mellifleur kneeling at the Altar. Earine rises. Ear. Thanks! thanks! good Marian! and like me, pure maids! Such fervent prayers sure will not be in vain. [The rest rise. But, to leave nought untried, as Reuben bade, In hymns and carols pour we praises forth, And wooe with melody the heavenly throne! Earine sings. “O God! throughout whose works divine, “Such perfect harmony doth shine! “By chiming spheres “Who metest years, “And months, and days! “O hear us praise “That wond'rous concord which in all appears! “May no discordance here be found! “Let nought but harmony abound! “O raise the swain “Whose loss our strain “With discord jars; “Our festal mars! “Raise him for whom the groves with grief resound!” Maudlin and Douce enter. Maud. O haly man! blest hermit! wi' what skill Hast thou remov'd the vip'rous pangs I felt! Lead me, my Douce, unto the altar's foot; That I may thank my God, as Reuben bade. Ear. Ha! hither bends the canker'd beldam, Maud! From whose brute son I bu erewhile escap'd— Haste! fly! or we shall quick be made her thralls. Dou. Fear naething, damsel! for my mother's chang'd; Is hither come to praise the gracious Gods, And crave forgi'ness for her wrangs to thee. Mysel am alter'd tu; late Douce the proud; But now as humble as the lowliest shrub That bends to heav'n's least breath! this dainty dress, Yer festal garment, I sal strait restore, Which by my mother's hest till now I wore; In russet gown and kirtle hence array'd, I's prove a meek and gentle rural maid. Maud. Forgi' me, virgin! I ha' lang been naught; And for my ill deeds on my knees am brought. Forgi' me, virgin! and I's henceforth be As gud, as I till now was ill to thee! Ear. And art thou alter'd, Maudlin? if thour't good, By that same art enthrall'd me in the wood, Oh, raise my love, my Æglamour from death! Your potency can do it with a breath. Yonder he lies, within the hermit's cell; Restore my love, and all things shall be well! Maud. That is already done. Clarion enters. Clar. Where, where's the maid, Earine? to Æglamour strait fly— He breathes; pronounc'd your name; haste! to him haste! Convince the still-craz'd shepherd you're alive; Or, in despair, on self-destruction bent, Again he'll seek you in the silver Trent. Ear. Does he then live? and is my love still true? Lead, lead me, maidens! come, good Marian, too! Now all is harmony! above, around! My shepherd lives! our loves shall now be crown'd! Clarion, Douce, and Maudlin remain. Clar. Why do not I to Æglamour return? What holds me here? with what strange fire I burn! Sure I was blind till now, or now am so— Yon maid has pass'd before me to and fro Oft times to-day, and never mark'd before, But that full proudly still herself she bore: Sure I mistook—she seems a courteous maid— Should I accost her, and with scorn be paid, 'Twould grieve me much; but hence with idle fear! Her kneeling mother left intention prayer, She this way bends—how fares the gentle Douce? Dou. Ca' ye me sae in scorn? gud shepherd, truce Wi' sic keen gibes for that I erst was proud, Nor interrupt devotion; ye're o'er loud: See ye not, swain, my mother kneeling there, Wi' upturn'd eyne, devoutly in her pray'r? Clar. I do, dear Douce! and I would kneel to thee, Did I not fear, you'd scorn my suit and me. Dou. What suit can Clarion ha' to lowly Douce? Rich swains ne'er wooe poor maids, but to seduce! Clar. True I am rich as any shepherd round; But let not that my honest suit confound. 'Tis true I own those fertile vallies green, And thymy downs, where herds and flocks are seen In countless numbers, mine; by heedful hinds Led to the pastures proper for their kinds; Their milk made cheese, their snowy fleeces shorn, And to the neighb'ring market duly born, Get me returns of all such town-made geer, As in my farm are needful; or appear To deck and trim my scarcely-equall'd cot; Good store of coin besides in chest I have got: True I were rich as any shepherd-swain, If gentle Douce's love I might obtain. Dou. What are yer fields, yer flocks, yer cot, yer coin To me, rich swain? had ye o' gold a mine, Sae far fra tempting, it would make me fear A simple wench might buy e'en gold o'er dear. Clar. But, pretty maid! did Clarion fairly wooe, Proffer to wed, and promise to be true; Had Douce no other shepherd in her thought, And Clarion she to like perchance were brought, No more ought she object his plenteous store, Than he doth Douce's state, tho' e'er so poor. Dou. It gars me blush to answer! but 'tis truth, I ne'er set eyne upon a comelier youth; Nae other shepherd i' my heart hath place; Yet I'm na' smitten wi' yer handsome face, Nae mair than wi' yer wealth; yer speech has most My pleas'd attention (for 'tis sooth) engrost— It shews ye honest, kind, and like to prove, Where e'er ye wooe, still constant i' yer love. My mother comes—gif ye indeed mean sooth, Tell her yer tale, her mind is turn'd to reuth. Clar. Thanks, gentle Douce! this unaffected leave, (Sure sign of an ingenuous mind) believe, Makes me the happiest shepherd o' the green! Maud. How am I chang'd fra what o'erlang I ha' been! The wicked fiend possess'd my soul is fled, And a' my thoughts are turn'd to God and gud! I ha' scap'd the thralldom o' the prince o' hell, To whom for aye I had near sold mysel! Nae mair a witch, but a right honest dame; And ilka one I meet sal ken the same. Clar. Good Maudlin, grant a boon, nor say me nay. Maud, Aught i' my gift, gud shepherd, ask and ha'. But what can sic a poor and outcast wretch Bestow on thee, stor'd swain? Clar. Thou art more rich! Owning, in my mind, what o' ervalues all That I, or wealthier swains, our own may call Of herds, or flocks, or cot, or farm, or field; With all the produce they their owners yield. The charms thou canst bestow— Maud. Out, out, alas! Nae mair in charms and spells do I surpass; Nae mair will Maud engage in deeds sae dark— Witchcraft, young shepherd, is the devil's wark! Dou. Gud mother, ye mistake th' well-meaning swain, He does na' wish ye to turn witch again. Clar. O, no, good dame! forefend, high heaven, I shou'd! My wishes, Maudlin, tend to nought but good; Thine, thy fair daughter's, and in her's too mine: She is the prize for which I throw my line! Maud. Speak plainer, shepherd, and wi' riddles truce. Clar. Then in plain terms, I love your daughter Douce. Love reigns around! hill, dale, cot, greenwood-bower, And their blithe tenants, own his sovereign power! The birds all pair'd make vocal every grove, While to his mate each chearful chaunts his love; The willing ewes, and wanton rams around, In sportive buttings frolick, mount, and bound; The heifer feels love's fire, breathes short, and pants; And to the steer his novel wishes grants: Each shepherd late invited round Sherwood, To the fam'd feast of jolly Robin Hood, Hath chose his buxom bride, hath woo'd and sped, Except myself—let it not, dame, be said, Clarion alone return'd from thence unwed! Maud. Now I come near ye, and yer meaning take; And gif ye'll wed my Douce, and ne'er forsake Yer low-born bride for some mair high-bred lass, But hand-in-hand still through life's journey pass, I gi' ye my consent and blessing baith! And, though ye are rich, for dower some fine-spun claith Bleach'd white as chalky cliffs; some linsey stuff, For winter coats and kirtles gud enough; Wi' a few marks o' gold, I ha' sav'd wi' care: This will I gi', and wish that it were mair. Clar. Talk not of dower, good mother, geer nor gold; The truest love is neither bought or sold! I have enough for both, nor wish that she Should bring or goods or coin for wedding fee; Bless'd with her love, why need I covet more, And take thy mite t'increase my boundless store? Rather of me receive the means of life, In gratitude for yielding Douce my wife; With every filial duty and respect, To shield thy age from want, and rude neglect! [Exeunt. The SCENE changes to another part of the Grove. Puck enters. Puck. How hard to keep frail life's near-fleeting breath Within the bosom of the sad young swain; Thinking Earine no longer lives To crown his passion, and reward his love! The holy hermit's prayers, and Maudlin's skill, Assisted by the friendly shepherds' pains, With every aid e'en I could minister, Were scarce sufficient to re-animate His death-like form, and cause the stream of life Again to flow through his obstructed veins; And, when reviv'd, all frantic for the loss (The double loss he call'd it) of the maid He hoped, by quitting life, to find in heaven, How sudden his relapse to seeming death! In which cold trance a second time he lies; But safe from danger: for Earin's voice, And touch, and breath, shall sweetly wooe and win His willing soul, with transport to abide, For her dear sake, soon as he knows she lives, In his fond breast, to life's extremest date! When she hath tried the force, and he hath felt Th' effects (and they are great) of pow'rful love; I will once more adminster what lies In me, to perfect and confirm their bliss! Meantime I will indulge my mirthful bent, In whatsoever sportful theme occurs— And lo! here comes rude Lorel, still my butt Of waggery, and whom I joy to jeer. Lorel enters. Lor. The bow-men say that Æglamour's restor'd! And, 'stead of digging, as was bid, his grave, Are sporting as they list around the cell— Sma' comfort sic like news to Lorel gives! Who hoped, his hated reuel being dead, To ha' without control, Earine. Puck. What should she, trow, with such a clown as thee? Thou have Earine! a swine-herd base Of uncouth form, and scarcely human face! With pent-house eye-brows, that together join; Of sullen churlishness the certain sign: A mouth distended e'en from ear to ear; Eyes, 'stead of love, inspiring hate and fear! Go, 'tend thy swine, nor think of such a maid, Who e'en to look at thee is sore afraid. Lor. What fay-like elf are ye, that mock and flout! Were ye Puck-hairy late? thus gay prank'd out. Gif that ye were, (as by yer voice and face Methinks it seems) and now a sprite o' grace, Leave scorning, Robin! nor perplex me mair, As whan my mother's simples hame I bare! I'm sure 'twas ye that bay'd me like a wolf; Then in my footway flamed a fiery gulph! A night owl beat her pinions 'gainst my head, 'Till o' the ground I fell, wi' fright near dead! Ye were that owl! and mair to gar me quake, Ye twined around my legs like a scaled snake, Which whan I graspt and strave to loose, strait turn'd To red hot iron, and a' my fingers burn'd! Puck. True, lubber Lorel; and when thou didst spy A will-o'-the-whisp, that meteor was I; Which led thee in a quagmire to thy knees: I can take any shape, thou know'st, I please. When I was vassal to your mother, I Could trace earth's utmost limits, now can fly Beyond the starry sphere: whence in a thought For the drown'd youth e'en now relief I brought; My power is mightier than erst was Maud's! Observe my silky wings! aërial gauds! My coronal, compos'd of lucid beams And flow'rets inter-twin'd! which well beseems My Iris-robe, with stars and crescents bright O'er-studded, darting round a silvery light! This my garb now, 'stead of the shaggy vest, Wherein Puck-hairy was uncouthly drest. Thus chang'd from beldam Maudlin's slavish drudge, Nor on vile errands longer forc'd to trudge, A spirit pure! I now am prone to good; The watchful guardian of this verdant wood! Unto the virtuous a firm friend I'll be; But, for thou'rt evil, a fear'd foe to thee! Lor. I prithee be not! and I's try to mend— I'th 'stead o'harming, yer assistance lend, I may reform; but canno' in a trice Be chang'd a' o'er to gud fra long-lov'd vice! Puck. Deserve my favour, you shall favour find! Go, shew your mother you're not far behind Herself in reformation; glad her heart, Which now in goodness takes an unus'd part: Hence, and conduct her to the hermit's cell, Whose reconcilement soon shall make all well. Lor. Troth, will I; wi' a score o'thanks to ye! And for yer kindness ye sal ne'er lack fee! Is gi'ye a plump porker, young and fat; Or the tithe-pig, 'stead o'the priest, ye's get: A brinded bulchin whan ye ask ye's ha'; Or a milch-kie See an observation on Kie, Act 3. p. 51. equally applicable to this passage.; gif ye're a gentle fay! For curds and cream, and sic like belly geer, Cheese, honey, wax, to want ye need na' fear; I's gar my sister Douce set ye ilk e'en Sic bowls o' milk for fairies yet ne'er seen; Wi' flaunes and custards: and, for ye're sae smert, Ne'er sal ye find the sma'est spot o' dirt, To 'file yer rainbow-robe, and rigol bright, Or ony gaud wi' whilk ye are bedight! Puck. Your meaning's good, therefore your offers please; But think not I, as late, want bribes like these: When I was Maudlin's hind, my appetites Were nearly human, seeking gross delights; And, for thy mother grudg'd me needful food, After my daily labours for her good, Instead of sleeping, which my stare then crav'd, For milk and flour in neighbouring barns I slav'd The live-long night; cut chaff, ground malt, thresh'd corn, Till Lucifer arose, bright star of morn! When, tir'd, upon the ember'd hearth I'd snore Some little space, to renovate each pow'r: Then, with cramm'd paunch, and cream-be-liquor'd throat, Hie home, before the sluggard-rousing note Of chanticleer bade shepherd-lads unfold Their bleating flocks, and drive them to the wold; Creep to my straw-pleach'd bed, thence seem to rise Ere Maudlin quite had oped her ferret eyes. These slaveries past, my essence pure regain'd, (Polluting which poor Puck in grossness chain'd!) I want nor flesh, nor flour, nor cakes, nor cream, Nor aught whereon mistaken mortals dream We fairies feed;—so, hence! while I attend Invisible, and to the sad swain lend Such help he yet may want; and quite restore Unto Earine her Æglamour! [Exeunt. The SCENE changes to the entrance to Reuben's Cell. Reuben, Robin Hood, Earine, Marian, &amp;c. &amp;c. attending Æglamour. Ear. So! gently! gently!—lay him on this bank Of dark-hued violets, their perfum'd scent Will make the breath my love again respires, Sweet as was that for me so late he lost! Oh, holy Sir! pardon a simple maid, For thus directing, where command is thine. Reu. Gentle and good! fair, and full wise withal! Needful it is to court each vagrant sense With those delights, will tempt them to abide In their frail mansion. With his slow-drawn breath, Let scent of sweetest flowers be intermix'd; Which, adding to the natural delight Enjoy'd in breathing, may promote the act: Clasp his hand, maid! in thine; quick from thy heart Love's fire will haste, as quick communicate A vital heat to every yet-chill vein: Then shall his eye-lids ope like dawn of day; Which to entice still further to disclose Their casked jewels, set thy face in view, To gaze on which each visual nerve they'll strain, And like twin-suns full brightly shine again. For one sweet sense, leave crav'd of modesty, Apply thy lips bedew'd with nectarous balm To his, as ruddy erst as now thy own; So shall he, tasting what might banquet gods, Heav'n for a while forego: to sooth each sense, In softest strains of harmony, then wooe His dull'd ear, deaf'ned by the waters' din; And say, would it but once again attend, Such notes await grim death himself might list; The sweetest notes of lov'd Earin's voice. Lord of the greenwood bower! bid music sound. Rob. Sound, softly sound the sweet-ton'd bugle-horn! Unharbour Harmony! and, like the deer, Or doubling hare, hunt her through all her wiles. The Woodmen sound the horns, and Earine sings. “Think it not, dearest youth! amiss, “If maiden coyness I forsake, “And on thy lips imprint a kiss; “But as 'tis meant the boldness take: “'Tis to restore “My Æglamour “To life and bliss, “That I thus kiss “My lovely and beloved swain; “Then be not coy “And cold, sweet boy! “Nor think amiss “That I thee kiss; “But kiss, oh kindly kiss me, love! again.” After the song is ended, the Woodmen continue sounding till Earine speaks. Ear. Cease, gentle woodmen! he's about to speak— The notes of nightingales discordant were Did they preclude his far more tuneful voice. Ægl. At length I am arriv'd, and landed safe Upon the peaceful shore where spirits dwell! 'Twas a long voyage; painful, dark, and cold! What have I not endur'd, since first I plung'd To seek my love i'th' suffocating stream! Sure I have known an intermediate state 'Twixt earth and heav'n! for oft methought I saw My sweet Earin! but no sooner strove To press her to my wishing, aching heart, Than she was snatch'd away! and, lost in shades, I wander'd up and down I know not where! Ear. Now she is thine, never to part again! [They embrace. Ægl. Ha! do I fold thee! then is my bliss compleat! The dale of death is fully overpast, And on the topmost hill of heav'n I'm plac'd! Come round, ye bless'd inhabitants, and view A pair, whose loves when mortal were as pure As yours, whose heavenly bowers we enter now! Ear. Alas, how wild he talks! collect thee, love! This is not heaven, nor these— Ægl. What say'st thou, sweet! Not heav'n, thus clasp'd in my Earin's arms? Were I in griefly Pluto's dark domain, Embracing thee, and thus by thee embrac'd, Thy presence would irradiate tenfold night, And make th'infernal realms than heav'n more bright! See! there's a gentle, bliss-enjoying pair; And there another! yonder is a third! Mark what elysian joy beams in their eyes! They're heav'n's inhabitants, and so are we, Pair'd (there's no bliss without) like turtle doves; Permitted here t'enjoy our earth-chose loves! Ear. Nay, my sweet Æglamour! look round again— These are thy well-known friends, the green-wood train; And this most venerable, holy man— Ægl. All's holy here! for I nor will, nor can Think this is aught but paradise, and thee The spirit of my lov'd Earine! She who was drown'd in thirty-armed Trent; Whom to rejoin, her faithful shepherd went Like watry way; and through its oozy bed Explor'd the path to heav'n and her that led! Reub. This wildness will subside—go, lead him forth To other air; and let his eyes take note Of the accustom'd objects all around; Fam'd Be'voir castle; Robin Hood's gay bower; The cots, and farms; green hills and flow'ry dales, Where he so oft hath graz'd his fleecy flocks; And when again he's perfect in his mind, Conduct him to the altar near my cell: There let him kneel, and thankfully adore The power and mercy did his life restore. Ægl. What says the hoary, venerable form? His looks are awful, yet they're wond'rous mild! Sure 'tis some patriarch's spirit, which presides In these abodes over departed souls! Ear. He rules all here; and wills that you retire To view the limits round: I'll with thee, love! And shew thee groves, and bowers, and verdant meads; Smooth-gliding streams, and idly-babbling brooks; Such as my Æglamour was wont to haunt. Ægl. Come then, pure partner in elyzium! come; Shew our celestial, ever-blooming home: Where, with these happy pairs, we'll fondly rove; Enjoy unfading youth, unsated love; And perfect bliss eternally all prove! [Æglamour and Earine go out. Rob. What thanks, thou holy man! are due to thee? What gifts, what guerdon? thy right-well-earn'd fee, For thus restoring him we all thought dead! How shall thy goodness be by us repaid? Reub. Nor thanks, nor guerdon, gentle Robin Hood, Were due to me, though I had done this good; Neither should on our social duties wait: But send your grateful thanks to heav'n's high gate! Whence a bright minister, by you unseen, Descended swift the youth and death between; Else had all mortal means perchance prov'd vain, And Æglamour for aye a corse had lain! But see! the sprite, invisible before To all but me, who did to life restore The drowned shepherd, comes with lightsome trips, The veil thrown off, his brightness did eclipse. Puck enters. Puck. Health and true happiness for aye betide Each jolly bridegroom, and his plighted bride! Unto my namesake, Robin of the wood, And his fair Marian (not more fair than good) Peaceful possession of their festal bower! In which they ne'er shall know less happy hour Than this: and unto holy Reuben's cell, Where with Devotion pure the saint doth dwell, Visions of spirits! far excelling me, As doth my essence frail mortality: Unto you all, invisible no more, (Nay rise, nor one of my degree adore) I come, (who late was wicked Maudlin's hind, In the vile beldam's thrall perforce confin'd; Now a free sprite!) the harbinger of bliss! Your ev'ry fear, or doubt, all safe dismiss For the entire recovery of the youth, Pure paragon of perfect love and truth! Into the frantic shepherd's brain a balm I have infus'd, that with remembrance calm Of ev'ry object round endues the swain: When, for his near-lost life restor'd again, His thanks are given at the holy shrine; With grateful praises to the pow'rs divine; Hither, with her who doth his steps attend, (Earine) his love-light way he'll bend: Be happy, mortals! pow'rful Puck's your friend! Reub. Thanks, gentle spirit! in the name of all, For that the swain thou didst to life recall! And for each other friendly office done, Which e'en our hopes and wishes have outrun! Mar. Here come the pair! their eyes with rapture bright: Now shall our feast be crown'd with true delight! Æglamour and Earine re-enter. Ægl. O gentle friends! how shall I e'er repay The various obligations of this day? To life, to sense, Earine restor'd! All bliss is center'd in that blissful word, Earine! sure joy was ne'er like mine! The sun with tenfold splendor seems to shine, The face of nature ne'er was half so gay, As on this more than festive, wond'rous day! Ear. Kind Marian! loving maids! embrace your friend; Earin's sorrows now are at an end! O holy hermit! once more on my knee— Reub. Rise, maiden! shepherd, rise! kneel not to me; To this bright minister your thanks are due. Puck. Not more, good Reuben! than they are to you. Ægl. To both, then, we our thankful tribute give. Ear. To whom we owe that Æglamour doth live! Puck. Here comes my quondam dame, to deprecate Your angers; and though I have cause of hate To the old crone, for her fell tyranny; Yet, from my bondage being now set free, And from foul witchcraft she at length reclaim'd, I all entreat with scoffing she's not sham'd; Pity her age, nor let her more be blam'd! Reub. Kind spirit! were we not to mercy prone, Thy mildness mright pervade a heart of stone. Maudlin, Clarion, Douce, and Lorel enter. Maud. Lo! on her knees repentant Maudlin bends, To crave yer pardons, and mak what amends For bygone wickedness she may to a' In guds, or person, harm'd; or kept in thra'; As, for my son, I kept Earine, Pent i' the hollow'd prison of a tree: Himsel tu, Lorel, doth repent; and sues To a', his rudeness ever did abuse. Lor. Ey! I's offend nae mair, gif ye'll forgi', But henceforth will a gentler swineherd be; My sister Douce is to be Clarion's wife, And we's a' change our crooked course o' life. Dou. Nae langer proud, as I ha' been a' day, I'm sae abash'd I ha'n't a word to say! Rob. Is 't even so, good Clarion? wilt thou wed And take, rich swain, this poor maid to thy bed? Well fare thy generous heart! Clar. I'm of thy mind; Thou, Robin, to the needy still art kind! Those who are blest with wealth, should of their store Be stewards, and dispensers to the poor: The maid I'll wed; make Lorel o'er my flocks, Herds, garners, barns, and other country stocks, Surviewer; for in such craft he hath skill: Repentant Maudlin, now reclaim'd from ill, Shall in my cot find shelter for her age; Where we'll attend her lore, and counsel sage, Till time shall call her to the peaceful grave: But first her pardon for past deeds I crave. Alk. Though erst her foe, now Clarion's suit I join; Give all your pardons free as I give mine, Unloosing from her neck this amulet strong: See! of itself it falls! sure sign among The righteous she's enroll'd: and all who groan Under th'effects of her late charms, now flown, (As did your cook, good Robin) in a trice Will be as free from pain as she from vice. Reub. Reuben the reconciler I am call'd! Since from the fiend her soul is disenthrall'd, And reconcil'd to heav'n, let me entreat Like grace and pardon she on earth may meet: I read each visage round, and think I spy A beam of mercy dart from ev'ry eye; 'Tis so! none e'er in sorrow went from hence! In name of all, full pardon I dispense! To punish crimes, is easy; to reclaim, Forgive, and cherish, gains the nobler name! Mercy's the darling attribute of heav'n; And as we pardon, are our sins forgiv'n! Lio. All now were bless'd, would sweetest Mellifleur The heart she has wounded kindly deign to cure. Mel. Freely! for troth I think thy passion pure! Tuck. Here's work enough, I trow, for Tuck the priest! Your marriages, young folks, would make a feast, Were there no other toward: I'll join your hands (Your hearts are join'd!) in wedlock's gentle bands; And when you mutual taste love's pure delights, Crown with a fruitful blessing Hymen's rites! Rob. Now then return we to our greenwood-bower; And, holy Reuben, there unbend an hour In harmless mirth; so reverend a guest Shall give a sanction to our rural feast: The light-foot venison, hare, and feather'd game; Each dainty flesh of bird, beast, wild or tame; With choicest fish, 'cates, fruits, ale, sparkling wine, Upon our plenteous board shall mingled shine. And would pleas'd Puck but add his song and jest, Banquets of kings were nought to our grac'd feast! Puck. With thanks, blithe Robin! I delight To pass in merriment the night; And the sad-employed day Now prepares to flit away: Soon bright Hesperus will appear, Harbinger of Dian clear, And her starry sky-robed train; Whose mingled beams shall o'er the plain Silver our footsteps, as we trace Again the path, with chearful pace, Was hither mark'd in mournful mood, With doleful dirge, through the greenwood. Now as we jocund bend our way, Let's chaunt a merry roundelay: Sound, woodmen! found your bugles sweet, In sprightly notes, while Puck doth mete Thereto some quaint and choral song, As to the festal bower we trip along. The Woodmen sound their bugles; Puck sings, and the rest join in chorus. SONG. “The chace is o'er; but, joy to tell! “Instead of sounding a mort-knell, “The hart, went cold to death's drear dell, “Is with his deer alive and well! CHORUS. “Sound, bugles, sound! the shepherd lad “No longer is ycleped “the sad.” “Sound, bugles, sound! all grief is flown; “And Love sits lightly on his throne! SONG. “Now to the feast, the greenwood feast, “With happy heart, each rural guest! “To which freed Puck shall add, at least, “His sportive pranks, apt song, and jest. CHORUS. “Sound, bugles, sound! each nymph and swain “Join in the chearful, choral strain; “And nimbly trip it through the wood, “To the fam'd feast of Robin Hood!” THE END.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Earine sings. “O God! throughout whose works divine, “Such perfect harmony doth shine! “By chiming spheres “Who metest years, “And months, and days! “O hear us praise “That wond'rous concord which in all appears! “May no discordance here be found! “Let nought but harmony abound! “O raise the swain “Whose loss our strain “With discord jars; “Our festal mars! “Raise him for whom the groves with grief resound!”</field>
