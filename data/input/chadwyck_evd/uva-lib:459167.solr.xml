      <field name="fulltext">THE MOUNTEBANK'S MASK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST ANTIMASKE OF MOWNTEBANKES. MOUNTEBANK'S SPEECH. The greate Master of medicine, Æsculapius, preserve and prolong the sanitie of these Royall and Princely Spectators. And if any here present happen to be valetudinarie, the blessed finger of our grand Master Paracelsus bee at hand for their speedie reparation. I have heard of a madd fellowe that styles himselfe a merry Greeke, and goes abroade by the name of Paradox, who with frisking and dauncing, and newe broacht doctrine, hath stolne himselfe, this Festivall tyme of Christmas, into favour at the Court of Purpoole, and having there gott some approbation for his small performance, is growne so audacious as to intrude himselfe into this honoured presence. To prevent whose further growyng fame, I have, with these my fellowe Artists of severall nations, all famous for the banke, hether made repaire, to present unto your view more wholesome, more pleasing, and more novell delights, which, to avoyd prolixitie, I distribute into these following common places. Names of Diseases cured by us, Which being infinite, purposelie we omitt. Musicall Charmes, Familiar Receipts, Sing their Songs, viz.: Chorus. What ist you lack, what would you buye? What is it that you neede? Come to me, Gallants; tast and trye: Heers that will doe the deede. 1 Songe. 1. Heers water to quench mayden fires; Heers spirits for olde occupiers; Heers powder to preserve youth long, Heers oyle to make weake sinews strong. What! 2. This powder doth preserve from fate; This cures the Maleficiate: Lost Maydenhead this doth restore, And makes them Virgins as before. What! 3. Heers cure for tooth ache, feaver, lurdens, Unlawfull and untimely burthens: Diseases of all Sexe and Ages This Medicine cures, or els asswages. What! 4. I have receipts to cure the gowte, To keepe poxe in, or thrust them owte; To coole hott bloods, colde bloods to warme, Shall doe you, if noe good, no harme. What! 2 Mo. Song. 1. Is any deffe? Is any blinde? Is any bound, or loose behinde? Is any fowle, that would be faire? Would any Lady change her haire? Does any dreame? Does any walke, Or in his sleepe affrighted talke? I come to cure what ere you feele, Within, without, from head to heele. 2. Be drummes or rattles in thy head; Are not thy braynes well tempered? Does Eolus thy stomak gnawe, Or breed there vermine in thy mawe? Dost thou desire, and cannot please, Loe! heere the best Cantharides. I come. 3. Even all diseases that arise From ill disposed crudities, From too much study, too much paine, From lasines, or from a straine, From any humor doing harme, Bee't dry or moist, or could or warme. I come. 4. Of lasie gowte I cure the Rich; I ridd the Beggar of his itch; I fleame avoyde, both thick and thin: I dislocated joyntes put in. I can old Æsons youth restore, And doe a thousand wonders more. Then come to me. What! 3 Song. 1. Maydes of the chamber or the kitchinge, If you be troubled with an itchinge, Come give me but a kisse or twoe, Ile give you that shall soone cure you. Nor Galen nor Hipocrates Did ever doe such cures as theis. 2. Crakt maids, that cannot hold your water, Or use to breake wynd in your laughter; Or be you vext with kibes or cornes, Ile cure; or Cuckolds of their hornes. Nor Galen. 3. If lustie Doll, maide of the Dairie, Chance to be blew-nipt by the Fairie, For making Butter with her taile, Ile give her that did never faile. Nor Galen. 4. Or if some worse mischance betide her, Or that the night mare over ride her; Or if shee tell all in a dreame, Ile cure her for a messe of creame. Nor Galen. 4 M. Song. 1. Is any so spent, that his wife keepes lent? Does any wast in his marrowe? Is any a slugg? Lett him tast of my drugg, Twill make him as quick as a sparrow. My powder and oyle, extracted with toile, By rare sublimbe infusions, Have proofe they are good, by myne owne deere bloode, In many strange conclusions. 2. Does any consume with the salt French rhewme? Doth the Gowte or palsy shake him: Or hath hee the stone, ere a moneth be gone, As sound as a bell Ile make him. My powder. 3. The greefes of the spleene, and maides that be greene, Or the heate in the Ladies faces; The gripes of the stitch, or the Schollers itch, In my cures deserue no places. My powder. [4.] The Webb or the Pinn, or the morphew of skynn, Or the rising of the mother, I can cure in a trice. Oh, then, be not nice, Nor ought that greeves you smother. My powder. FAMILIAR RECEIPTS. An approved receipt against Melancholie fœminine. If any Lady be sick of the Sullens, she knowes not where, let her take a handfull of simples, I know not what, and use them I know not how, applying them to the parte grievde, I knowe not which, and shee shall be well, I knowe not when. Against the Skirvie. If any Scholler bee troubled with an itch, or breaking out, which in tyme may prove the Skirvy, lett him first forbeare clawing and fretting meates, and then purge choller, but by noe meanes upwards. For restoring Gentlemen Ushers' Leggs. If any Gentleman Usher hath the consumption in his legges, lett him feede lustelie on veale two monethes in the spring tyme, and forbeare all manner of mutton, and hee shall increase in calfe. For the Tentigo. If any be troubled with the Tentigo, lett him travell to Japan, or, because the forest of Turnbolia is of the same altitude, or elevation of the Pole, and at hand, lett him hunt there for his recreation, and it shalbe done in an instant. For the Angina. If any Scholler labor of the Angina, a daungerous disease in the throate, soe that he cannot speake an howre togeather once in a quarter of a yeere, lett him forbeare all violent exercises, as trotting to Westminster Hall every terme, and all hott liquors and vapors; lett him abstayne from company, retiring himselfe warme cladd in his studie fowre daies in a weeke, et fiet. For a Fellon. If any be troubled with a Fellon on his finger, whereby he hath lost the lawfull use of his hand, lett him but once use the exercise of swinging, and stretche himselfe uppon the soveraigne tree of Tiburnia, and it will presently kill the Fellon. Probatum. For a Tympanie. If any Virgine be soe sick of Cupid that the disease is growne to a Tympanie, lett her with all speed possible remove herselfe, changing aire for forty weekes at least, keeping a spaire diett as she travelles, allwayes after using lawfull exercises, till shee be married, and then she is past daunger. For Barrennes. If any Lady be long married, yet childles, lett her first desire to be a mother, and to her breakefast take a newe-laid egge, in a spoonefull of goat's-milke, with a scruple of Ambergreece; and at supper feede on a henn trodden by one cock. But above all thinges, lett her avoide hurrying in a Coroch, especially on the stones, and assuming a finer molde then nature ment her, and noe doubt she shall fructifie. For the Falinge Sicknes. If any woman be trobled with the falinge sicknes, lett her not travell Westward Ho, because she must avoide the Isle of Man; and for that it is an evill Spirrit only entred into her, lett her for a Charme allwayes have her legges a crosse when she is not walking, and this will help her. For a Rapture. If any Tradsman bee troubled with a Rupture in the bowells of his estate, that hee cannot goe abroade, lett him decoct Golde from a pound to a noble, taking the broth thereof from six monethes to six monethes, and hee shalbe as able a man as ever he was. Nowe, Princely Spectators, to lett you see that we are men quallified from head to foote, wee will shewe you a peece of our footemanship. Dance Antemaske. [Exeunt. Enter Paradoxe. Helth and jouisance to this faire assembly. Now the thrice three learned Sisters forsake mee, if euer I beheld such beauties in Athens. You aske, perhappes, whoe I am that thus conceitedly salute you? I am a merry Greeke, and a Sophister of Athens, who, by fame of certaine novell and rare presentments undertaken and promised by the gallant Spirrits of Graia drawne hither, have intruded myselfe, Sophiste like, in att the back doore, to bee a Spectator, or rather a Censor of their undertakings. The Muses graunt they may satisfie our expectations. Ah, the shewes and the songs, and the speeches, and the playes, and the comedies, and the actings that I have seene at Athens! The universe never saw the like. But lett that passe. There was another end of my coming, and that was to gett some of these Beauties to bee my desciples; for I teach them rare doctrynes, but delightfull; and if you be true Athenians, (that is, true lovers of novelties, as I hope you all are) you will give my hopes theire lookt for expectation. Knowe, then, my name is Paradox: a strange name, but proper to my discent, for I blush not to tell you truth. I am a slipp of darknes, my father a Jesuite, and my mother an Anabaptist; and as my name is strange, soe is my profession, and the art which I teach, my selfe being the first that reduced it to rules and method, beares my owne name, Paradoxe. And I pray you, what is a Parradox? It is a Quodlibet, or strayne of witt and invention strued above the vulgar conceyte, to begett admiration. And (because method is the mother of discipline) I devide my Paradoxe into theis heads—Masculine, Fœminine, and Newter; and first of the first, for the Masculine is more worthie then the Fœminine, and the Fœminine then the Newter. Drawes his Booke and reades. Masculine. 1. He cannot be a Cuckold that weares a Gregorian, for a perriwigg will never fitt such a head. 2. A Knight of the long robe is more honorable then a Knight made in the fielde; for furrs are deerer then spurs. 3. Tis better to be a coward then a Captaine; for a goose lives longer then a cock of the game. 4. A Caniball is the lovingst man to his enemie; for willingly no man eates that he loves not. 5. A Batchelor is but halfe a man, and being wedd, he may prove more then halfe a monster; for Aries and Taurus rule the head and shoulders, and Capricorne reacheth as lowe as the knees. 6. A wittall cannot be a Cuckold: for a Cuckolde is wronged by his wife, which a wittall cannot bee; for volenti non fit injuria. 7. A Shoemaker is the fittest man of the parish to make a Constable; for he virtuti officii may put any man in the stocks, and enlarge him at last. 8. A prisoner is the best fencer; for hee ever lies at a close warde. 9. An elder Brother may be a wise man; for he hath wherewithall to purchase experience, at any rate. 10. A Musicion will never make good Vintner; for he deales to much with flats and sharps. 11. A Drunkard is a good philosopher; for hee thinkes arighte that the world goes round. 12. The Divell cannot take Tobacco through his nose; for S t. Dunstone hath seerd that upp with his tongs. 13. Prentices are the nimblest Scavengers; for they can clense the Citty Stews in one day. 14. Noe native Phisician can bee excellent; for all excellent simples are forriners. 15. A Master of Fence is more honorable then a M r. of art; for good fighting was before good writing. 16. A Court Foole must needs be learned; for hee goes to schoole in the Porter's Lodge. 17. Burgomasters ought not to weare their furd gownes at Middsomer; for soe they may bring in the sweating sicknes againe. 18. A Cuttpurse is of the surest trade; for his worke is no sooner done, but hee hath his mony in his hand. Fœminine. 1. Tis farr better to marrie a widdow then a maide.— Causa patet. 2. Down right language is the best Rhetorique to wyn a wooman; for playne dealing is a jewell, and there is no lady but desires her lapp full of them. 3. Weomen are to be commended for loving Stage players; for they are men of known action. 4. If a wooman with child long to lye with another man, her husband must consent; for if hee will not, shee will doe it without him. 5. Rich widdowes were ordained for younger brothers; for they, being borne to no land, must plow in another man's soile. 6. A maid should marry before the years of discreation; for Malitia supplet et cætera. 7. Tis dangerous to wed a widdow; for she hath cast her rider. 8. An English virgin singes sweeter here than at Brussells; for a voluntary is sweeter than a forct noate. 9. A greate Lady may with her honor weare her servant's picture; for a shaddowe yet never made a Cuckold. 10. A painted Lady best fitts a Captaine; for so both may fight under theire cullors. 11. It is good for a young popish wench to marry an old man; for so shee shalbe sure to keepe all fasting nights. 12. A dangerous secrett is safely plac't in a woman's bosom; for noe wise man would search for it there. 13. A woman of learning and tongues is an admirable creature; for a starling that can speake is a present for an Emperor. 14. There were never so many chast wives as in this age; for now tis out of fashion to lye with their owne husbands. 15. A greate Lady should not weare her owne haire; for that's as meane as a coate of her owne spinning. 16. A faire woman's necke should stand awrie; for so she lookes as if she were looking for a kisse. 17. Women love fish better then flesh; for they will have Place, whatever they pay for it. Newter. 1. Ould thinges are the best thinges; for there is nothing newe but diseases. 2. The best bodyes should weare the playnest habits; for painted Clothes were made to hide bare walls. 3. Dissemblers may safely be trusted; for their meaning is ever contrary to theire words. 4. Musicions cannot be but helthfull; for they live by good aire. 5. An Usurer is the best Christian; for Quantum nummorum in arca, Tantum habet et fidei. 6. None should haue license to marry but rich folks; for Vacuum is a monster in rerum natura. 7. A hare is more subtile then a fox; for shee makes more dubbles then old Reynard. 8. Tis better to be a beggar then a Marchant; for all the worlde lyes open to his traffique, and yet he paies no custome. 9. Tis more safe to be drunk with the hopp then with the grape; for a man should be more inward with his Countryman than with a stranger. 10. It is better to buy honour then to deserve it; for what is farr fecht and deere bought is good for Ladyes. 11. A man deepe in debt should be as deepe in drink; for Bacchus cancells all manner of obligations. 12. Playhowses are more necessary in a well govern'd Commonwelth then publique Schooles; for men are better taught by example then precept. 13. It is better to feede on vulgar and grosse meats, then on dainty and high dishes; for they that eate only partridge or quaile, hath no other brood then woodcock or goose. 14. Taverns are more requisite in a Citty then Academies; for it is better the multitude were loving then learned. 15. A Tobacco Shop and a Bawdy howse are coincident; for smoake is not without fire. 16. An Almanacke is a booke more worthy to be studied then the history of the world; for a man to knowe himself is the most worthy knowledge, and there hee hath twelve signes to know it by. 17. Welth is better then witt; for few poetts have had the fortune to be chozen Aldermen. 18. Marriage frees a man from care; for then his wife takes all uppon her. 19. A Kennell of hounds is the best Consort; for they neede no tuning from morning to night. The Court makes better Schollers than the Universitie; for where a King vouchsafes to bee a teacher, every man blushes to be a non proficient. Music sounds. Enter Pages. Para. But harke! Musick: they are uppon entrance. I must put upp. Mayne Maske. Enter Pages 4. Theire Song, dialoguewise. Where shall wee finde reliefe? Is there noe end of griefe? Is there noe comfort left? What cruell Charmes bereft The patrons of our youth? Wee must now begg for ruth. Enter Obscuritie. Kind pitty is the most Poore boyes can hope for, when Their joyes are lost. Obscuritie. Light, I salute thee: I, Obscuritie, The sonn of Darknes and forgetfull Lethe; I, that envie thy brightnes, greete thee nowe, Enforc't by Fate. Fate makes the strongest bow. The ever youthfull Knights by spells inchain'd, And long within my shady nooks restraynd, Must be enlargd, and I the Usher bee To theire night glories; so the Fates agree. Then, putt on life, Obscuritie, and prove As light as light, for awe, if not for love. Loe! heere their tender yeerd, kind-harted Squires, Mourning their Masters' losse: no new desires Cann trayne them from these walks, but here they wend From shade to shade, and give their toyles noe end. But now will I relieve their suffring care. Heare me, faire Youths! since you so constant are In faith to your lov'd Knights, goe hast a pace, And with your bright lights guide them to this place; For if you fall directly, that discent, Their wisht approach will farther search prevent. Haste by the virtue of a charming songe, While I retrive them, least they lagg to longe. THE CALL, OR SONGE OF OBSCURITIE. Appeare, Appeare, you happie Knights! Heere are severall sortes of Lights: Fire and beawtie shine togeather, Your slowe steppes inviting hether. Come away; and from your eyes Th'olde shades remove, For now the Destinies Release you at the suite of Love. So, so: tis well marcht, march a pace; Two by two fill up the place, And then with voice and measure Greete the Kinge of Love and Pleasure. Nowe, Musicke, change thy notes, and meete Aptly with the Dancers' feete; For tis the pleasure of Delight That they shall tryumph all this night. THE SONG AND DANCE TOGETHER. Frolick measures now become you, Overlong obscured Knights: What if Lethe did benum you, Love now wakes you to delights. Love is like a golden flowre, Your comely youth adorning: Pleasure is a gentle shower Shedd in some April morning. Lightly rise, and lightly fall you In the motion of your feete: Move not till our notes doe call you; Musicke makes the action sweete. Music breathing blowes the fire Which Cupid feeds with fuell, Kindling honour and desire, And taming hartes most cruell. Quickly, Quickly, mend your paces, Nimbly changing measurd graces: Lively mounted high aspire, For joy is only found in fire. Musicke is the soule of measure, Mixing both in equall grace; Twinnes are they, begott of Pleasure, When she wisely nombred space. Nothing is more old or newer Then nomber, all advancing; And noe nomber can be truer Then musick joyn'd with dancing. Every Knight elect a Bewty, Such as may thy hart inflame: Think that her bright eye doth view thee, And to her thy action frame. So shall none be faint or wearie, Though treading endles paces; For they all are lighte and merry Whose hopes are fedd with graces. Sprightly, sprightly, end your paces, Nimbly changing measurd graces: Lively mounted high aspire, For joy is only found in fire. Obscuritie. Servants of Love, for soe it fittes you bee, Since hee alone hath wrought your liberty, His ceremonies nowe and courtly rights Performe with care, and free resolved sprights. To sullen darknes my dull steppes reflect; All covett that which Nature doth affect. The Second Measure; which danc't, SONG TO TAKE OUT THE LADIES. On, on, brave Knights, you have well shewde Each his due part in nimble dances: These Bewties to whose hands are owde Yours, wonder why You spare to try. Marke how inviting are their glances. Such, such a charm, such faces, such a call, Would make old Æson skip about the Hall. See, see faire choise, a starry sphere Might dymme bright day: choose here at pleasure. Please your owne eye: Approve you heere, Right gentle Knights: To these softe wights View, talk and touch, but all in measure. Farr farr from hence be roughnesse, farr a frowne; Your fair deportment this faire night shall crowne. After they have danced with the Ladyes, and sett them in their places, fall to their last Dance. Enter Paradox, and to him his Disciples. Silence, Lordings, Ladies, and fidells! Lett my tongue twang awhile. I have seene what hath beene shewed; and now give me leave to shew what hath not beene seene, for the honour of Athens. By vertue of this musicall Whistle I will summon my disciples. See obedience: heere they are all redy. Put forward, my paradoxicall Pupils, methodically and arithmetically, one by one. 1. Behould this principall Artist that swift encounters mee, whose head is honoured by his heeles for dauncing in a Chorus of a Tragedy presented at Athens, where hee produced such learned varietie of footing, and digested it so orderly and close to the ground, that hee was rewarded with this Relique, the Cothurne or Buskin of Sophocles, which for more eminence he weares on his head. The paradoxical vertue thereof is, that being dipt into River or Spring, it alters the nature of the liquor, and returneth full of wine of Chios, Palermo, or Zaunte. 2. This second Master of the science of footemanship (for hee never came on horsback in his life) was famed att the Feast of Pallas, where in dauncing he came of with such lofty trickes, turnes above ground, capers, crosse capers, horse capers, so high and so lofty performed, that hee for prize bare away the Helmett of Pallas. The paradoxicall vertue of the Caske is, that in our travells if we fall among enemies, shew but this, and they suddenly vanish all like fearefull shaddowes. 3. Now, view this third peece of Excellence: this is hee that putt downe all the Bakers, at the feast of Ceres, and soe daunced there, as if he had kneaded doe with his feete: wherewith the Goddesse was so tickled, that shee in reward sett this goodly loafe on his head, and endued it with this paradoxicall influence, that cutt of it and eate as often as you please, it streit fills up againe, and is in the instant healed of any wound our hunger can inflict on it. 4. Approach now thou that comst in the reare of my disciples, but mayest march in the vanguard of thy validitie; for at the celebration of the feast of Venus Cytherea, this Amoroso did expresse such passion with his eyes, such castes, such wynkes, such glances, and with his whole body such delightfull gestures, such cringes, such pretty wanton mymickes, that hee wonne the applause of all; and, as it was necessary at the Feast of that Goddesse, hee had then a most ample and inflaming codpeece, which, with his other graces, purchast him this prize, the Smock of Venus, wrapt turbantlike on his head, the same shee had on when shee went to bed to Mars, and was taken napping by Vulcan. The paradoxe of it is, that if it bee hanged on the top of our Maypole, it drawes to us all the young lads and lasses neere adjoyning, without power to part till wee strike sale ourselves. And now I have named our Maypole, goe bring it forth, though it be more cumbersome then the Trojan horse: bring it by force of armes, and see you fixe it fast in the midst of this place, least, when you circle it with your caprichious dances, it falls from the foundation, lights upon some ladyes head, and cuffes off her Periwigg. But now for the glory of Athens! Musicke playes the Antymaske. The Disciples dance 1 Strayne. Wee have given you a taste of the excellency of our Atheniall Revells, which I will now dignifie with myne owne person. Lye here, impediment, whereof being freed, I will discend. O, you Authors of Greeke woonders! what ostent is this? What supernaturall Paradoxe? a wooden Maypole find the use of voluntarie motion! Assuredly this tree was formerly the habitation of some wood nimphe, for the Dryads (as the Poets say) live in trees; and perhaps, to honour my dauncing, the nimphe hath crept into this tree againe: soe I apprehend it, and will entertaine her curtesie. Paradox his Disciples, and the Maypole, all daunce. Did ever eye see the like footing of a tree, or could any tree but an Athenian tree doe this? or could any nimphe move it but an Athenian nimphe? Faire Nymphe, though I can nott arrive at thy lippes, yet will I kisse the wooden maske that hides thy no doubt most amyable face. Paradox offers to kisse, and a Nymph's head meets him out of the Maypole. Woonder of woonders! Sweete Nymphe, forbeare: my whole structure trembles: mortalitie cannot stand the brightnes of thy countenance. Pursue me not, I beseech thee: putt up thy face, for love's sake. Helpe, helpe! Disciples, take away this dismall peale from me. Rescue me! Rescue me, with all your violence.—So, the Divell is gone, and I will not stay long after. Lordings and Ladies: if there bee any here desirous to be instructed in the misterye of Paradoxinge, you shall have me at my lodging in the black and white Court, at the signe of the Naked Boye. And so to you all the best wishes of the night. Enter Mountebanke, like a Swisse. Stay, you presumptious Paradox! I have viewed thy antickes and thy Puppett, which have kindled in me the fire of Emulation. Looke; am I not in habitt as fantasticke as thy selfe? Dost thou hope for grace with Ladyes, by thy novell doctrine? I am a man of art: witnesse this, my Charming Rodd, wherewith I worke Miracles; and whereas thou, like a fabulous Greeke, hast made monsters of thy Disciples, loe! I will oppose squadron against squadron, and plaine trueth against painted fiction. Now for [thy] moving Ale-signe: but for frighting the Devill out of it, I could encounter thee with Tottnam Hie Crosse, or Cheape Crosse, (though it bee new guilt) but I scorne odds, and therefore will I affront thee Pole to Pole. Goe, Disciples: usher in our lofty inchanted motion; and, Paradoxe, now betake you to your tackling, for you deale with men that have ayre and fire in them. Paradoxe. Assist me, thou active Nimphe, and you, my glorious associates. Victory! Victory for Athens! [Dance. Mountybanke. Accomplisht Greeke! now, as we are true Mountebankes, this was bravely performed on both parts, and nothing now remaynes but to make these two Maypoles better acquainted. But we must give place: the Knights appeare. Obscuritie Enter. Enough of these night sportes! part fairely, Knightes, And leave an edge on pleasure, least these lightes I suddenly dymme all; and pray, how then Will theis gay Ladies shift among you men, In such confusion? Some their homes may misse: Obscuritie knowes tricks as madd as this. But make your parting innocent for me; I will no Author now of Error bee. My selfe shall passe with you, a friend of lighte, Giving to all this round a kind good nighte. LAST SONG. Wee must away: yet our slack pace may showe Tis by constraint wee this faire Orbe forgoe. Our longer stay may forfitt what but nowe Love hath obtaind for us: to him we bowe, And to this gentler Powre, who soe contriv'd That wee from sullen shades are now depriv'd, And hither brought, where Favour, Love, and Light, Soe gloriously shine, they banish Night. More would we say, but Fate forbids us more.— Our Cue is out—Good night is gone before. FINIS.</field>
