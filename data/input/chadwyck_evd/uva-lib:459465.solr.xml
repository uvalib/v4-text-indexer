      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND PART OF The bloody Conquests of mighty Tamburlaine. With his impassionate fury, for the death of his Lady and loue, faire Zenocrate: his fourme of exhortation and discipline to his three sons, and the maner of his own death.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. The generall welcomes Tamburlain receiu'd, When he arriued last vpon our stage, Hath made our Poet pen his second part, Wher death cuts off the progres of his pomp. And murdrous Fates throwes al his triumphs down, But what became of faire Zenocrate, And with how manie cities sacrifice He celebrated her said funerall, Himselfe in presence shal vnfold at large.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus. I. ScÃ¦na. I. Orcanes, king of Natolia, Gazellus, vice-roy of Byron, Vpibassa, and their traine, with drums and trumpets. Orcanes. Egregious Uiceroyes of these Eastern parts Plac'd by the issue of great Baiazeth: And sacred Lord the mighty Calapine: Who liues in Egypt, prisoner to that slaue, Which kept his father in an yron cage: Now have we martcht from faire Natolia Two hundred leagues, and on Danubius banks, Our warlike hoste in compleat armour rest, Where Sigismond the king of Hungary Should meet our person to conclude a truce. What? Shall we parle with the Christian? Or crosse the streame, and meet him in the field. Byr. King of Natolia, let vs treat of peace, We all are glutted with the Christians blood, And haue a greater foe to fight against, Proud Tamburlaine, that now in Asia, Neere Guyrons head doth set his conquering feet, And means to fire Turky as he goes: Gainst him my Lord must you addresse your power. Vpibas. Besides, king Sigismond hath brought from Christendome, More then his Camp of stout Hungarians, Sclauonians, Almans, Rutters, Muffes, and Danes, That with the Holbard, Lance, and murthering Axe, Will hazard that we might with surety hold. Though from the shortest Northren Paralell, Uast Gruntland compast with the frozen sea, Inhabited with tall and sturdy men, Gyants as big as hugie Polypheme: Millions of Souldiers cut the Artick line, Bringing the strength of Europe to these Armes. Our Turky blades shal glide through al their throats, And make this champion mead a bloody Fen, Danubius stream that runs to Trebizon, Shall carie wrapt within his scarlet waues, As martiall presents to our friends at home. The slaughtered bodies of these Christians. The Terrene main wherin Danubius fals, Shall by this battell be the bloody Sea. The wandring Sailers of proud Italy, Shall meet those Christians fleeting with the tyde, Beating in heaps against their Argoses. And make faire Europe mounted on her bull, Trapt with the wealth and riches of the world, Alight and weare a woful mourning weed. Byr. Yet stout Orcanes, Prorex of the world, Since Tamburlaine hath mustred all his men, Marching from Cairon northward with his camp, To Alexandria, and the frontier townes, Meaning to make a conquest of our land: Tis requisit to parle for a peace With Sigismond the king of Hungary: And saue our forces for the hot assaults Proud Tamburlaine intends Natolia. Orc. Uiceroy of Byron, wisely hast thou said: My realme, the Center of our Empery Once lost, All Turkie would be ouerthrowne: And for that cause the Christians shall haue peace. Slauonians, Almains, Rutters, Muffes, and Danes Feare not Orcanes, but great Tamburlaine. Nor he but Fortune that hath made him great. We haue reuolted Grecians, Albanees, Cicilians, Iewes, Arabians, Turks, and Moors, Natolians, Sorians, blacke Egyptians, Illicians, Thracians, and Bythinians, Enough to swallow forcelesse Sigismond' Yet scarse enough t'encounter Tamburlaine. He brings a world of people to the field, From Scythia to the Orientall Plage Of India, wher raging Lantchidol Beates on the regions with his boysterous blowes, That neuer sea-man yet discouered: All Asia is in Armes with tamburlaine, Euen from the midst of fiery Cancers Tropick, To Amazonia vnder Capricorne. And thence as far as Archipellago. All Affrike is in Armes with tamburlaine. Therefore Uiceroies the Christians must haue peace. ScÃ¦na. 2, Sigismond, Fredericke, Baldwine, and their traine with drums and trumpets. Sigis. Orcanes (as our Legates promist thee) Wee with our Peeres haue crost Danubius stream to treat of fri?dly peace or deadly war: Take which thou wilt, for as the Romans vsde I here present thee with a naked sword, Wilt thou haue war, then shake this blade at me, If peace, restore it to my hands againe: And I wil sheath it to confirme the same. Orc. Stay Sigismond, forgetst thou I am he That with the Cannon shooke Vienna walles. And made it dance vpon the Continent: As when the massy substance of the earth, Quiuer about the Axeltree of heauen. Forgetst thou that I sent a shower of dartes Mingled with powdered shot and fethered steele So thick vpon the blink-ei'd Burghers heads, That thou thy self, then County-Pallatine, The king of Boheme, and the Austrich Duke, Sent Herralds out, which basely on their knees In all your names desirde a truce of me? Forgetst thou, that to haue me raise my siege, Wagons of gold were set before my tent: Stampt with the princely Foule that in her wings Caries the fearfull thunderbolts of Ioue, How canst thou think of this and offer war? Sig. Vienna was besieg'd, and I was there, Then County-Pallatine, but now a king: And what we did, was in extremity: But now Orcanes, view my royall hoste, That hides these plaines, and seems as vast and wide, As dooth the Desart of Arabia. To those that stand on Badgeths lofty Tower, Or as the Ocean to the Traueiler That restes vpon the snowy Appenines: And tell me whether I should stoope so low, Or treat of peace with the Natolian king? Byr. Kings of Natolia and of Hungarie, We came from Turky to confirme a league, And not to dare ech other to the field: A friendly parle might become ye both. Fred. And we from Europe to the same intent, Which if your General refuse or scorne, Our Tents are pitcht, our men stand in array. Ready to charge you ere you stir your feet. Nat. So prest are we, but yet if Sigismond Speake as a friend, and stand not vpon tearmes, Here is his sword, let peace be ratified On these conditions specified before, Drawen with aduise of our Ambassadors. Sig. Then here I sheath it, and giue thee my hand, Neuer to draw it out, or manage armes Against thy selfe or thy confederates: But whilst I liue will be at truce with thee. Nat. But (Sigismond) confirme it with an oath, And sweare in sight of heauen and by thy Christ. Sig. By him that made the world and sau'd my soule The sonne of God and issue of a Mayd, Sweet Iesus Christ, I sollemnly protest, And vow to keepe this peace inuiolable. Nat. By sacred Mahomet, the friend of God, Whose holy Alcaron remaines with vs, Whose glorious body when he left the world, Closde in a coffyn mounted vp the aire, And hung on stately Mecas Temple roofe, I sweare to keepe this truce inuiolable: Of whose conditions, and our solemne othes Sign'd with our handes, each shal retaine a scrowle: As memorable witnesse of our league. Now Sigismond, if any Christian King Encroche vpon the confines of thy realme, Send woord, Orcanes of Natolia Confirm'd this league beyond Danubius streame, And they will (trembling) sound a quicke retreat, So am I fear'd among all Nations. Sig. If any heathen potentate or king Inuade Natolia, Sigismond will send A hundred thousand horse train'd to the war, And backt by stout Lanceres of Germany. The strength and sinewes of the imperiall seat. Nat. I thank thee Sigismond, but when I war All Asia Minor, Affrica, and Greece Follow my Standard and my thundring Drums: Come let vs goe and banquet in our tents: I will dispatch chiefe of my army hence To faire Natolia, and to Trebizon, To stay my comming gainst proud Tamburlaine. Freend Sigismond, and peeres of Hungary, Come banquet and carouse with vs a while, And then depart we to our territories. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na. 3. Callapine with Almeda, his keeper. Callap. Sweet Almeda, pity the ruthfull plight Of Callapine, the sonne of Baiazeth, Born to be Monarch of the Western world: Yet here detain'd by cruell Tamburlaine. Alm. My Lord I pitie it, and with my heart Wish your release, but he whose wrath is death, My soueraigne Lord, renowmed tamburlain. Forbids you further liberty than this. Cal. Ah were I now but halfe so eloquent To paint in woords, what Ile perfourme in deeds, I know thou wouldst depart from hence with me. Al. Not for all Affrike, therefore mooue me not. Cal. Yet heare me speake my gentle Almeda. Al. No speach to that end, by your fauour sir. Cal. By Cario runs. Al. No talke of running, I tell you sir. Cal. A litle further, gentle Almeda. Al. Wel sir, what of this? Cal. By Cario runs to Alexandria Bay, Darotes streames, wherin at anchor lies A Turkish Gally of my royall fleet, Waiting my comming to the riuer side, Hoping by some means I shall be releast, Which when I come aboord will hoist vp saile, And soon put foorth into the Terrene sea: Where twixt the Isles of Cyprus and of Creete, We quickly may in Turkish seas arriue. Then shalt thou see a hundred kings and more Upon their knees, all bid me welcome home. Amongst so mady crownes of burnisht gold, Choose which thou wilt, all are at thy command, A thousand Gallies mann'd with Christian slaues I freely giue thee, which shall cut the straights, And bring Armados from the coasts of Spaine, Fraughted with golde of rich America: The Grecian virgins shall attend on thee, Skilful in musicke and in amorous laies: As faire as was Pigmalions Iuory gyrle, Or louely Io metamorphosed. With naked Negros shall thy coach be drawen, And as thou rid'st in triumph through the streets, The pauement vnderneath thy chariot wheels With Turky Carpets shall be couered: And cloath of Arras hung about the walles, Fit obiects for thy princely eie to pierce. A hundred Bassoes cloath'd in crimson silk Shall ride before the on Barbarian Steeds: And when thou goest, a golden Canapie Enchac'd with pretious stones, which shine as bright As that faire vail that couers all the world: When PhÅbus leaping from his Hemi-Spheare, Discendeth downward to th'Antipodes. And more than this, for all I cannot tell. Alm. How far hence lies the Galley, say you? Cal. Sweet Almeda, scarse halfe a league from hence. Alm. But need we not be spied going aboord? Cal. Betwixt the hollow hanging of a hill And crooked bending of a craggy rock, The sailes wrapt vp, the mast and tacklings downe, She lies so close that none can find her out, Alm. I like that well: but tel me my Lord, if I should let you goe, would you bee as good as your word? Shall I be made a king for my labour? Cal. As I am Callapine the Emperour, And by the hand of Mahomet I sweare, Thou shalt be crown'd a king and be my mate, Alm. Then here I sweare, as I am Almeda, Your Keeper vnder Tamburlaine the great, (For that's the style and tytle I haue yet) Although he sent a thousand armed men To intercept this haughty enterprize, Yet would I venture to conduct your Grace, And die before I brought you backe again. Cal. Thanks gentle Almeda, then let vs haste, Least time be past, and lingring let vs both. Al. When you will my Lord, I am ready, Cal. Euen straight: and farewell cursed Tamburlaine. Now goe I to reuenge my fathers death. Exeunt ScÃ¦na. 4. Tamburlaine with Zenocrate, and his three sonnes, Calyphas, Amyras, and Celebinus, with drummes and trumpets. Tamb. Now bright zenocrate, the worlds faire eie, Whose beames illuminate the lamps of heau?, Whose chearful looks do cleare the clowdy aire And cloath it in a christall liuerie, Now rest thee here on faire Larissa Plaines, Where Egypt and the Turkish Empire parts, Betweene thy sons that shall be Emperours, And euery one Commander of a world. zen. Sweet tamburlain, when wilt thou leaue these armes And saue thy sacred person free from scathe: And dangerous chances of the wrathfull war. Tam. When heauen shal cease to mooue on both the poles &amp; when the ground wheron my souldiers march Shal rise aloft and touch the horned Moon, And not before my sweet zenocrate: Sit vp and rest thee like a louely Queene. So, now she sits in pompe and maiestie: When these my sonnes, more procions in mine eies Than all the wealthy kingdomes I subdewed: Plac'd by her side, looke on their mothers face, But yet me thinks their looks are amorous, Not martiall as the sons of Tamburlaine Water and ayre being simbolisde in one: Argue their want of courage and of wit, Their haire as white as milke and soft as Downe. Which should be like the quilles of Porcupines. As blacke as Ieat, and hard as Iron or steel, Bewraies they are too dainty for the wars. Their fingers made to quauer on a Lute, Their armes to hang about a Ladies necke: Their legs to dance and caper in the aire: Would make me thinke them Bastards, not my sons, But that I know they issued from thy wombe, That neuer look'd on man but Tamburlaine. zen. My gratious Lord, they haue their mothers looks But wh? they list, their c?quering fathers hart: This louely boy the yongest of the three, Not long agoe bestrid a Scythian Steed: Trotting the ring, and tilting at a gloue: Which when he tainted with his slender rod, He raign'd him straight and made him so curuet, As I cried out for feare he should haue falne, Tam. Wel done my boy, thou shalt haue shield and lance Armour of proofe, horse, helme, &amp; Curtle-axe And I will teach thee how to charge thy foe, And harmelesse run among the deadly pikes. If thou wilt loue the warres and follow me, Thou shalt be made a King and raigne with me, Keeping in yron cages Emperours. If thou exceed thy elder Brothers worth, And shine in compleat vertue more than they, Thou shalt be king before them, and thy seed Shall issue crowned from their mothers wombe, Cel. Yes father, you shal see me if I liue, Haue vnder me as many kings as you, And martch with such a multitude of men, As all the world shall tremble at their view. tam. These words assure me boy, thou art my sonne, When I am old and cannot mannage armes, Be thou the scourge and terrour of the world, Amy. Why may not I my Lord, as wel as he, Be tearm'd the scourge and terrour of the world? tam. Be al a scourge and terror to the world, Or els you are not sons of Tamburlaine. Cal. But while my brothers follow armes my lord Let me accompany my gratious mother, They are enough to conquer all the world And you haue won enough for me to keep. tam. Bastardly boy, sprong fr? some cowards loins: And not the issue of great Tamburlaine, Of all the prouinces I haue subdued Thou shalt not haue a foot, vnlesse thou beare A mind corragious and inuincible: For he shall weare the crowne of Persea, Whose head hath deepest scarres, whose breast most woundes, Which being wroth, sends lightning from his eies. And in the furrowes of his frowning browes, Harbors reuenge, war, death and cruelty: For in a field whose superfluities Is couered with a liquid purple veile, And sprinkled with the braines of slaughtered men, My royal chaire of state shall be aduanc'd: And he that meanes to place himselfe therein Must armed wade vp to the chin in blood. zen. My Lord, such speeches to our princely sonnes, Dismaies their mindes before they come to prooue The wounding troubles angry war affoords. Cel. No Madam, these are speeches fit for vs, For if his chaire were in a sea of blood, I would prepare a ship and saile to it. Ere I would loose the tytle of a king, Amy: And I would striue to swim through pooles of blood, Or make a bridge of murthered Carcases, Whose arches should be fram'd with bones of Turks, Ere I would loose the tytle of a king. tam. Wel louely boies, you shal be Emperours both Stretching your conquering armes from east to west: And sirha, if you meane to weare a crowne, When we shall meet the Turkish Deputie And all his Uiceroies, snatch it from his head, And cleaue his Pericranion with thy sword. Cal. If any man will hold him, I will strike, And cleaue him to the channell with my sword, tamb. Hold him, and cleaue him too, or Ile cleaue thee For we will martch against them presently. Theridamas, Techelles, and Casane Promist to meet me on Larissa plaines With hostes apeece against this Turkish crue, For I haue sworne by sacred Mahomet, To make it parcel of my Empery, The trumpets sound Zenocrate, they come. ScÃ¦na. 5. Enter Theridamas, and his traine with Drums and Trumpets. Tamb. Welcome Theridamas, king of Argier, Ther. My Lord the great and mighty Tamburlain, Arch-Monarke of the world, I offer here, My crowne, my selfe, and all the power I haue, In all affection at thy kingly feet. tam. Thanks good theridamas. ther. Under my collors march ten thousand Greeks And of Argier and Affriks frontier townes, Twise twenty thousand valiant men at armes, All which haue sworue to sacke Natolia: Fiue hundred Briggandines are vnder saile, Meet for your seruice on the sea, my Lord, That lanching from Argier to Tripoly, Will quickly ride before Natolia: And batter downe the castles on the shore. tam. Wel said Argier, receiue thy crowne againe. ScÃ¦na. 6. Enter Techelles and Vsumeasane together. Tamb. Kings of Morocus and of Fesse, welcome. Vsu. Magnificent &amp; peerlesse Tamburlaine, I and my neighbor King of Fesse haue brought To aide thee in this Turkish expedition, A hundred thousand expert souldiers: From Azamor to Tunys neare the sea, Is Barbary vnpeopled for thy sake, And all the men in armour vnder me, Which with my crowne I gladly offer thee. tam. Thanks king of Morocus, take your crown again. tech. And mighty Tamburlaine, our earthly God, Whose lookes make this inferiour world to quake, I here present thee with the crowne of Fesse, And with an hoste of Moores trainde to the war, Whose coleblacke faces make their foes retire, And quake for feare, as if infernall Ioue Meaning to aid them in this Turkish armes, Should pierce the blacke circumference of hell, With vgly Furies bearing fiery flags, And millions of his strong tormenting spirits: From strong Tesella vnto Biledull, All Barbary is vnpeopled for thy sake. tam. Thanks king of Fesse, take here thy crowne again Your presence (louing friends and fellow kings) Makes me to surfet in conceiuing ioy, If all the christall gates of Ioues high court Were opened wide, and I might enter in To see the state and maiesty of heauen, It could not more delight me than your sight. Now will we banquet on these plaines a while, And after martch to Turky with our Campe, In number more than are the drops that fall When Boreas rents a thousand swelling cloudes, And proud Orcanes of Natolia, With all his viceroies shall be so affraide, That though the stones, as at Deucalions flood, Were turnde to men, he should be ouercome: Such lauish will I make of Turkish blood, That Ioue shall send his winged Messenger To bid me sheath my sword, and leaue the field: The Sun vnable to sustaine the sight, Shall hide his head in thetis, watery lap, And leaue his steeds to faire Boetes charge: For halfe the world shall perish in this fight: But now my friends, let me examine ye, How haue ye spent your absent time from me? Vsum. My Lord our men of Barbary haue martcht Foure hundred miles with armour on their backes, And laine in leagre fifteene moneths and more, For since we left you at the Souldans court, We haue subdude the Southerne Guallatia, And all the land vnto the coast of Spaine. We kept the narrow straight of Gibralter, And made Canarea cal vs kings and Lords, Yet neuer did they recreate themselues, Or cease one day from war and hot alarms, And therefore let them rest a while my Lord. Tam. They shal Casane, and tis time yfaith. Tech. And I haue martch'd along the riuer Nile, To Machda, where the mighty Christian Priest Cal'd Iohn the great, sits in a milk-white robe, Whose triple Myter I did take by force, And made him sweare obedience to my crowne. From thence vnto Cazates did I martch, Wher Amazonians met me in the field: With whom (being women) I vouchsaft a league, And with my power did march to zansibar The Westerne part of Affrike, where I view'd. The Ethiopian sea, riuers and lakes: But neither man nor child in al the land: Therfore I tooke my course to Manico. Where vnresisted I remoou'd my campe: And by the coast of Byather at last, I came to Cubar, where the Negros dwell, And conquering that, made haste to Nubia, There hauing sackt Borno the Kingly seat, I took the king, and lead him bound in chaines Unto Damasco, where I staid before. Tamb. Well done Techelles: what saith Theridamas? ther. I left the confines and the bounds of Affrike And made a voyage into Europe, Where by the riuer Tyros I subdew'd Stoka, Padalia, and Codemia. Then crost the sea and came to Oblia. And Nigra Silua, where the Deuils dance, Which in despight of them I set on fire: From thence I crost the Gulfe, call'd by the name Mare magiore, of th'inhabitantes: Yet shall my souldiers make no period Untill Natolia kneele before your feet. tamb. Then wil we triumph, banquet and carouse, Cookes shall haue pensions to prouide vs cates, And glut vs with the dainties of the world, Lachrima Christi and Calabrian wines Shall common Souldiers drink in quaffing boules I, liquid golde when we haue conquer'd him Mingled with corrall and with orientall pearle: Come let vs banquet and carrouse the whiles.

Now say my Lords of Buda and Bohemia, What moti? is it that inflames your thoughts, And stirs your valures to such soddaine armes? Fred. Your Maiesty remembers I am sure What cruell slaughter of our Christian bloods, These heathnish Turks and Pagans lately made, Betwixt the citie Zula and Danubius, How through the midst of Verna and Bulgaria And almost to the very walles of Rome, They haue not long since massacred our Camp, It resteth now then that your Maiesty Take all aduantages of time and power, And worke reuenge vpon these Infidels: Your Highnesse knowes for Tamburlaines repaire, That strikes a terrour to all Turkish hearts, Natolia hath dismist the greatest part Of all his armie, pitcht against our power Betwixt Cutheia and Orminius mount: And sent them marching vp to Belgasar, Acantha, Antioch, and CÃ¦saria, To aid the kings of Soria and Ierusalem. Now then my Lord, aduantage take hereof, And issue sodainly upon the rest: That in the fortune of their ouerthrow, We may discourage all the pagan troope, That dare attempt to war with Christians. Sig. But cals not then your Grace to memorie The league we lately made with king Orcanes, Confirm'd by oth and Articles of peace, And calling Christ for record of our trueths? This should be treacherie and violence, Against the grace of our profession. Bald. No whit my Lord: for with such Infidels, In whom no faith nor true religion rests, We are not bound to those accomplishments, The holy lawes of Christendome inioine: But as the faith which they prophanely plight Is not by necessary pollycy, To be esteem'd assurance for our selues, So what we vow to them should not infringe Our liberty of armes and victory. Sig. Though I confesse the othes they vndertake, Breed litle strength to our securitie, Yet those infirmities that thus defame Their faiths, their honors, and their religion, Should not giue vs presumption to the like, Our faiths are sound, and must be consinuate, Religious, righteous, and inuiolate. Fred. Assure your Grace tis superstition To stand so strictly on dispensiue faith: And should we lose the opportunity That God hath giuen to venge our Christians death And scourge their foule blasphemous Paganisme? As fell to Saule, to Balaam and the rest, That would not kill and curse at Gods command, So surely will the vengeance of the highest And iealous anger of his fearefull arme Be pour'd with rigour on our sinfull heads, If we neglect this offered victory. Sig. Then arme my Lords, and issue sodainly, Giuing commandement to our generall hoste, With expedition to assaile the Pagan, And take the victorie our God hath giuen. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na. 2.

Gazellus, Vribassa, and the rest, Now will we march from proud Orminus mount To faire Natolia, where our neighbour kings Expect our power and our royall presence, T'incounter with the cruell tamburlain, That nigh Larissa swaies a mighty hoste, And with the thunder of his martial tooles Makes Earthquakes in the hearts of men and heauen, Gaz. And now come we to make his sinowes shake, With greater power than erst his pride hath felt, An hundred kings by scores wil bid him armes, And hundred thousands subiects to each score: Which if a shower of wounding thunderbolts Should breake out off the bowels of the clowdes And fall as thick as haile vpon our heads, In partiall aid of that proud Scythian, Yet should our courages and steeled crestes, And numbers more than infinit of men, Be able to withstand and conquer him. Vrib. Me thinks I see how glad the christian King Is made, for ioy of your admitted truce: That could not but before be terrified: With vnacquainted power of our hoste. Enter a messenger. Mess. Arme dread Soueraign and my noble Lords The treacherous army of the Christians, Taking aduantage of your slender power, Comes marching on vs, and determines straight, To bid vs battaile for our dearest liues. Orc. Traitors, villaines, damned Christians. Haue I not here the articles of peace, And solemne couenants we haue both confirm'd, He by his Christ, and I by Mahomet? Gaz. Hel and confusion light vpon their heads, That with such treason seek our ouerthrow, And cares so litle for their prophet Christ. Orc. Can there be such deceit in Christians, Or treason in the fleshly heart of man, Whose shape is figure of the highest God? Then if there be a Christ, as Christians say, But in their deeds deny him for their Christ: If he be son to euerliuing Ioue, And hath the power of his outstretched arme, If he be iealous of his name and honor, As is our holy prophet Mahomet, Take here these papers as our sacrifice And witnesse of thy seruants periury. Open thou shining vaile of Cynthia And make a passage from the imperiall heauen That he that sits on high and neuer sleeps, Nor in one place is circumscriptible, But euery where fils euery Continent, With strange infusion of his sacred vigor, May in his endlesse power and puritie Behold and venge this Traitors periury. Thou Christ that art esteem'd omnipotent, If thou wilt prooue thy selfe a perfect God, Worthy the worship of all faithfull hearts, Be now reueng'd vpon this Traitors soule, And make the power I haue left behind (Too litle to defend our guiltlesse liues) Sufficient to discomfort and confound The trustlesse force of those false Christians. To armes my Lords, on Christ still let vs crie, If there be Christ, we shall haue victorie. Sound to the battell, and Sigismond comes out wounded. Sig. Discomfited is all the Christian hoste, And God hath thundered vengeance from on high, For my accurst and hatefull periurie. O iust and dreadfull punisher of sinne, Let the dishonor of the paines I feele, In this my mortall well deserued wound, End all my penance in my sodaine death, And let this death wherein to sinne I die, Conceiue a second life in endlesse mercie. Enter Orcanes, Gazellus, Vribassa, with others. Or. Now lie the Christians bathing in their bloods, And Christ or Mahomet hath bene my friend. Gaz. See here the periur'd traitor Hungary, Bloody and breathlesse for his villany. Orc. Now shall his barbarous body be a pray To beasts and foules, and al the winds shall breath Through shady leaues of euery sencelesse tree, Murmures and hisses for his hainous sin. Now scaldes his soule in the Tartarian streames, And feeds vpon the banefull tree of hell, That zoacum, that fruit of bytternesse, That in the midst of fire is ingraft, Yet flourisheth as Flora in her pride, With apples like the heads of damned Feends, The Dyuils there in chaines of quencelesse flame, Shall lead his soule through Orcus burning gulfe: From paine to paine, whose change shal neuer end: What saiest thou yet Gazellus to his foile: Which we referd to iustice of his Christ, And to his power, which here appeares as full As raies of Cynthia to the clearest sight? Gaz. Tis but the fortune of the wars my Lord, Whose power is often proou'd a myracle. Orc. Yet in my thoughts shall Christ he honoured, Not dooing Mahomet an iniurie, Whose power had share in this our victory: And since this miscreant hath disgrac'd his faith, And died a traitor both to heauen and earth, We wil both watch and ward shall keepe his trunke Amidst these plaines, for Foules to pray vpon. Go Vribassa, giue it straight in charge. Vri. I will my Lord. Exit Vrib. Orc.

Exeunt. ScÃ¦na vltima. The Arras is drawen and Zenocrate lies in her bed of state, Tamburlaine sitting by her: three Phisitians about her bed, tempering potions. Theridamas, Techelles, Vsumeasane, and the three sonnes. Tamburlaine, Blacke is the beauty of the brightest day, The golden balle of heauens eternal fire, That danc'd with glorie on the siluer waues: Now wants the fewell that enflamde his beames And all with faintnesse and for foule disgrace, He bindes his temples with a frowning cloude, Ready to darken earth with endlesse night: Zenocrate that gaue him light and life, Whose eies shot fire from their Iuory bowers, And tempered euery soule with liuely heat, Now by the malice of the angry Skies, Whose iealousie admits no second Mate, Drawes in the comfort of her latest breath All dasled with the hellish mists of death. Now walk the angels on the walles of heauen, As Centinels to warne th'immortall soules, To entertaine deuine Zenocrate. Apollo, Cynthia, and the ceaslesse lamps That gently look'd vpon this loathsome earth, Shine downwards now no more, but deck the heauens To entertaine diuine Zenocrate. The christall springs whose taste illuminates Refined eies with an eternall sight, Like tried siluer runs through Paradice To entertaine diuine zenocrate. The Cherubins and holy Seraphins That sing and play before the king of kings, Use all their voices and their instruments To entertaine diuine Zenocrate. And in this sweet and currious harmony, The God that tunes this musicke to our soules: Holds out his hand in highest maiesty To entertaine diuine Zenocrate. Then let some holy trance conuay my thoughts, Up to the pallace of th'imperiall heauen: That this my life may be as short to me As are the daies of sweet Zenocrate: Phisitions, wil no phisicke do her good? Phis. My Lord, your Maiesty shall soone perceiue: And if she passe this fit, the worst is past. tam. Tell me, how fares my faire Zenocrate? zen. I fare my Lord, as other Emperesses, That when this fraile and transitory flesh Hath suckt the measure of that vitall aire That feeds the body with his dated health, Wanes with enforst and necessary change. tam. May neuer such a change transfourme my loue In whose sweet being I repose my life, Whose heauenly presence beautified with health, Giues light to PhÅbus and the fixed stars, Whose absence make the sun and Moone as darke As when opposde in one Diamiter: Their Spheares are mounted on the serpents head, Or els discended to his winding traine: Liue still my Loue and so conserue my life, Or dieng, be the anchor of my death. zen. Liue still my Lord, O let my soueraigne liue, And sooner let the fiery Element Dissolue, and make your kingdome in the Sky, Than this base earth should shroud your maiesty: For should I but suspect your death by mine, The comfort of my future happinesse And hope to meet your highnesse in the heauens, Turn'd to dispaire, would break my wretched breast And furie would confound my present rest. But let me die my Loue, yet let me die, With loue and patience let your true loue die: Your griefe and furie hurtes my second life, Yet let me kisse my Lord before I die, And let me die with kissing of my Lord. But since my life is lengthened yet a while, Let me take leaue of these my louing sonnes, And of my Lords whose true nobilitie Haue merited my latest memorie: Sweet sons farewell, in death resemble me, And in your liues your fathers excellency. Some musicke, and my fit wil cease my Lord. They call musicke. tam. Proud furie and intollorable fit, That dares torment the body of my Loue, And scourge the Scourge of the immortall God: Now are those Spheares where Cupid vsde to sit, Wounding the world with woonder and with loue, Sadly supplied with pale and ghastly death: Whose darts do pierce the Center of my soule, Her sacred beauty hath enchaunted heauen, And had she liu'd before the siege of Troy, Hellen, whose beauty sommond Greece to armes, And drew a thousand ships to Tenedos, Had not bene nam'd in Homers Iliads: Her name had bene in euery line he wrote: Or had those wanton Poets, for whose byrth Olde Rome was proud, but gasde a while on her, Nor Lesbia, nor Corrinna had bene nam'd, zenocrate had bene the argument Of euery Epigram or Eligie. The musicke sounds, and she dies. tam. What, is she dead? Techelles, draw thy sword, And wound the earth, that it may cleaue in twaine, And we discend into th'infernall vaults, To haile the fatall Sisters by the haire, And throw them in the triple mote of Hell, For taking hence my faire zenocrate. Casane and theridamas to armes, Raise Caualieros higher than the cloudes: And with the cannon breake the frame of heauen, Batter the shining pallace of the Sun, And shiuer all the starry firmament: For amorous Ioue hath snatcht my loue from hence, Meaning to make her stately Queene of heauen, What God so euer holds thee in his armes, Giuing thee Nectar and Ambrosia, Behold me here diuine zenocrate, Rauing, impatient, desperate and mad, Breaking my steeled lance, with which I burst The rusty beames of Ianus Temple doores, Letting out death and tyrannising war: To martch with me vnder this bloody flag, And if thou pitiest Tamburlain the great, Come downe from heauen and liue with me againe. ther. Ah good my Lord be patient, she is dead, And all this raging cannot make her liue, If woords might serue, our voice hath rent the aire, If teares, our eies haue watered all the earth: If griefe, our murthered harts haue straind forth blood Nothing preuailes, for she is dead my Lord. tam. For she is dead? thy words doo pierce my soule Ah sweet theridamas, say so no more, Though she be dead, yet let me think she liues, And feed my mind that dies for want of her: Where ere her soule be, thou shalt stay with me Embalm'd with Cassia, Amber Greece and Myrre, Not lapt in lead but in a sheet of gold, And till I die thou shalt not be interr'd. Then in as rich a tombe as Mausolus, We both will rest and haue one Epitaph Writ in as many seuerall languages, As I haue conquered kingdomes with my sword, This cursed towne will I consume with fire, Because this place bereft me of my Loue: The houses burnt, wil looke as if they mourn'd And here will I set vp her stature, And martch about it with my mourning campe, Drooping and pining for zenocrate. The Arras is drawen.</field>

Long liue Callepinus, Emperour of Turky. Cal. Thrice worthy kings of Natolia, and the rest, I will requite your royall gratitudes With all the benefits my Empire yeelds: And were the sinowes of th'imperiall seat So knit and strengthned, as when Baiazeth My royall Lord and father fild the throne, Whose cursed fate hath so dismembred it, Then should you see this Thiefe of Scythia, This proud vsurping king of Persea, Do vs such honor and supremacie, Bearing the vengeance of our fathers wrongs, As all the world should blot our dignities Out of the booke of base borne infamies. And now I doubt not but your royall cares Hath so prouided for this cursed foe, That since the heire of mighty Baiazeth (An Emperour so honoured for his vertues) Reuiues the spirits of true Turkish heartes, In grieuous memorie of his fathers shame, We shall not need to nourish any doubt, But that proud Fortune, who hath followed long The martiall sword of mighty Tamburlaine, Will now retaine her olde inconstancie, And raise our honors to as high a pitch In this our strong and fortunate encounter, For so hath heauen prouided my escape, From al the crueltie my soule sustaind, By this my friendly keepers happy meanes, That Ioue surchardg'd with pity of our wrongs, Will poure it downe in showers on our heads: Scourging the pride of cursed tamburlain. Orc. I haue a hundred thousad men in armes, Some, that in conquest of the periur'd Christian.

And here this table as a Register Of all her vertues and perfections. tam. And here the picture of zenocrate, To shew her beautie, which the world admyr'd, Sweet picture of diuine Zenocrate, That hanging here, wil draw the Gods from heauen: And cause the stars fixt in the Southern arke, Whose louely faces neuer any viewed, That haue not past the Centers latitude. As Pilgrimes traueile to our Hemi-spheare. Onely to gaze vpon Zenocrate. Thou shalt not beautifie Larissa plaines. But keep within the circle of mine armes. At euery towne and castle I besiege, Thou shalt be set vpon my royall tent. And when I meet an armie in the field, Whose looks will shed such influence in my campe, As if Bellona, Goddesse of the war Threw naked swords and sulphur bals of fire, Upon the heads of all our enemies. And now my Lords, aduance your speares againe, Sorrow no more my sweet Casane now: Boyes leaue to mourne, this towne shall euer mourne, Being burnt to cynders for your mothers death. Cal. If I had wept a sea of teares for her, It would not ease the sorrow I sustaine. Amy. As is that towne, so is my heart consum'd, With griefe and sorrow for my mothers death. Cel. My mothers death hath mortified my mind, And sorrow stops the passage of my speech. Tamb. But now my boies, leaue off, and list to me, That meane to teach you rudiments of war: Ile haue you learne to sleepe vpon the ground, March in your armour throwe watery Fens, Sustaine the scortching heat and freezing cold, Hunger and cold right adiuncts of the war. And after this, to scale a castle wal, Besiege a fort, to vndermine a towne, And make whole cyties caper in the aire. Then next, the way to fortifie your men, In champion grounds, what figure serues you best, For with the quinque-angle fourme is meet, Because the corners there may fall more flat: Whereas the Fort may fittest be assailde, And sharpest where th'assault is desperate. The ditches must be deepe, the Counterscarps Narrow and steepe, the wals made high and broad, The Bulwarks and the rampiers large and strong, With Caualieros and thicke counterforts, And roome within to lodge sixe thousand men. It must haue priuy ditches, countermines, And secret issuings to defend the ditch. It must haue high Argins and couered waies To keep the bulwark fronts from battery, And Parapets to hide the Muscatiers: Casemates to place the great Artillery, And store of ordinance that from euery flanke May scoure the outward curtaines of the Fort, Dismount the Cannon of the aduerse part, Murther the Foe and saue their walles from breach. When this is learn'd for seruice on the land, By plaine and easie demonstration, Ile teach you how to make the water mount, That you may dryfoot martch through lakes &amp; pooles, Deep riuers, hauens, creekes, and litle seas, And make a Fortresse in the raging waues, Fenc'd with the concaue of a monstrous rocke, Inuincible by nature of the place. When this is done, then are ye souldiers, And worthy sonnes of Tamburlain the great, Cal. My Lord, but this is dangerous to be done, We may be slaine or wounded ere we learne. tam. Uillain, art thou the sonne of Tamburlaine, And fear'st to die, or with a Curtle-axe To hew thy flesh and make a gaping wound? Hast thou beheld a peale of ordinance strike A ring of pikes, mingled with shot and horse, Whose shattered lims, being tost as high as heauen, Hang in the aire as thicke as sunny motes, And canst thou Coward stand in feare of death? Hast thou not seene my horsmen charge the foe, Shot through the armes, cut ouerthwart the hands, Dieng their lances with their streaming blood, And yet at night carrouse within my tent, Filling their empty vaines with aiery wine, That being concocted, turnes to crimson blood, And wilt thou shun the field for feare of woundes? Uiew me thy father that hath conquered kings, And with his hoste martch round about the earth, Quite voide of skars, and cleare from any wound, That by the warres lost not a dram of blood, And see him lance his flesh to teach you all. He cuts his arme. A wound is nothing be it nere so deepe, Blood is the God of Wars rich liuery. Now look I like a souldier, and this wound As great a grace and maiesty to me, As if a chaire of gold enamiled, Enchac'd with Diamondes, Saphyres, Rubies And fairest pearle of welthie India Were mounted here vnder a Canapie: And I sat downe, cloth'd with the massie robe, That late adorn'd the Affrike Potentate. Whom I brought bound vnto Damascus walles. Come boyes and with your fingers search my wound, And in my blood wash all your hands at once, While I sit smiling to behold the sight. Now my boyes, what think you of a wound? Cal. I know not what I should think of it, Me thinks tis a pitifull sight. Cel. Tis nothing: giue me a wound father. Amy. And me another my Lord. tam. Come sirra, giue me your arme. Cel. Here father, cut it brauely as you did your own tam. It shall suffice thou darst abide a wound My boy, Thou shalt not loose a drop of blood, Before we meet the armie of the Turke. But then run desperate through the thickest throngs, Dreadlesse of blowes, of bloody wounds and death: And let the burning of Larissa wals My speech of war, and this my wound you see Teach you my boyes to beare couragious minds, Fit for the followers of great tamburlaine. Vsumeasane now come let vs martch Towards Techelles and Theridamas, That we haue sent before to fire the townes, The towers and cities of these hatefull Turks, And hunt that Coward, faintheart, runaway, With that accursed traitor Almeda, Til fire and sword haue found them at a bay. Vsu. I long to pierce his bowels with my sword, That hath betraied my gracious Soueraigne, That curst and damned Traitor Almeda. Tam. Then let vs see if coward Calapine Dare leuie armes against our puissance, That we may tread vpon his captiue necke, And treble all his fathers slaueries. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na. I, Techelles, Theridamas and their traine. Therid. Thus haue wee martcht Northwarde from Tamburlaine, Unto the frontier point of Soria: And this is Balsera their chiefest hold, Wherein is all the treasure of the land. tech. Then let vs bring our light Artilery, Minions, Fauknets, and Sakars to the trench, Filling the ditches with the walles wide breach, And enter in, to seaze vpon the gold: How say ye Souldiers, Shal we not? Soul. Yes, my Lord, yes, come lets about it, ther. But stay a while, summon a parle, Drum, It may be they will yeeld it quietly, Knowing two kings, the friend to tamburlain, Stand at the walles, with such a mighty power. Summon the battell. Captaine with his wife and sonne. Cap. What requier you my maisters? ther. Captaine, that thou yeeld vp thy hold to vs. Cap. To you? Why, do you thinke me weary of it? Tech. Nay Captain, thou art weary of thy life, If thou withstand the friends of Tamburlain. ther. These Pioners of Argier in Affrica, Euen in the cannons face shall raise a hill Of earth and fagots higher than thy Fort, And ouer thy Argins and couered waies Shal play vpon the bulwarks of thy hold Uolleies of ordinance til the breach be made, That with his ruine fils vp all the trench. And when we enter in, not heauen it selfe Shall ransome thee, thy wife and family. Tech. Captaine, these Moores shall cut the leaden pipes, That bring fresh water to thy men and thee, And lie in trench before thy castle walles: That no supply of victuall shall come in, Nor issue foorth, but they shall die: And therefore Captaine, yeeld it quietly. Cap. Were you that are the friends of Tamburlain Brothers to holy Mahomet himselfe, I would not yeeld it: therefore doo your worst. Raise mounts, batter, intrench, and vndermine, Cut off the water, all conuoies that can, Yet I am resolute, and so farewell. ther. Pioners away, and where I stuck the stake, Intrench with those dimensions I prescribed: Cast vp the earth towards the castle wall, Which til it may defend you, labour low: And few or none shall perish by their shot. Pion. We will my Lord. Exeunt. Tech. A hundred horse shall scout about the plaines To spie what force comes to relieue the holde. Both we (theridamas) wil intrench our men, And with the Iacobs staffe measure the height And distance of the castle from the trench, That we may know if our artillery Will carie full point blancke vnto their wals. ther. Then see the bringing of our ordinance Along the trench into the battery, Where we will haue Galions of sixe foot broad, To saue our Cannoniers from musket shot, Betwixt which, shall our ordinance thunder foorth, And with the breaches fall, smoake, fire, and dust, The cracke, the Ecchoe and the souldiers crie Make deafe the aire, and dim the Christall Sky. tech. Trumpets and drums, alarum presently, And souldiers play the men, the holds is yours. Enter the Captaine with his wife and sonne. Olym. Come good my Lord, &amp; let vs haste fr? hence Along the caue that leads beyond the foe, No hope is left to saue this conquered hold. Cap. A deadly bullet gliding through my side, Lies heauy on my heart, I cannot liue. I feele my liuer pierc'd and all my vaines, That there begin and nourish euery part, Mangled and torne, and all my entrals bath'd In blood that straineth from their orifex. Farewell sweet wife, sweet son farewell, I die. Olym. Death, whether art thou gone that both we liue? Come back again (sweet death) &amp; strike vs both: One minute end our daies, and one sepulcher Containe our bodies: death, why comm'st thou not? Wel, this must be the messenger for thee, Now vgly death stretch out thy Sable wings, And carie both our soules, where his remaines. Tell me sweet boie, art thou content to die? These barbarous Scythians full of cruelty, And Moores, in whom was neuer pitie found, Will hew vs peecemeale, put vs to the wheele, Or els inuent some torture worse than that, Therefore die by thy louing mothers hand, Who gently now wil lance thy Iuory throat, And quickly rid thee both of paine and life. Son. Mother dispatch me, or Ile kil my selfe, For think ye I can liue, and see him dead? Giue me your knife, good mother) or strike home: The Scythians shall not tyrannise on me. Sweet mother strike, that I may meet my father. She stabs him. Olym. Ah sacred Mahomet, if this be sin, Intreat a pardon of the God of heauen, And purge my soule before it come to thee. Entert Theridamas, Techelles and all their traine. ther. How now Madam, what are you doing? Olim. Killing my selfe, as I haue done my sonne, Whose body with his fathers I haue burnt, Least cruell Scythians should dismember him. tech. Twas brauely done, and like a souldiers wife, Thou shalt with vs to Tamburlaine the great, Who when he heares how resolute thou wert, Wil match thee with a viceroy or a king. Olym. My Lord deceast, was dearer vnto me, Than any Uiceroy, King or Emperour. And for his sake here will I end my daies. ther. But Lady goe with vs to Tamburlaine, And thou shalt see a man greater than Mahomet. In whose high lookes is much more maiesty Than from the Concaue superficies. Of Ioues vast pallace the imperiall Orbe, Unto the shinining bower where Cynthia sits, Like louely thetis in a Christall robe, That treadeth Fortune vnderneath his feete, And makes the mighty God of armes his slaue: On whom death and the fatall sisters waite, With naked swords and scarlet liueries: Before whom (mounted on a Lions backe) Rhammusia beares a helmet ful of blood, And strowes the way with braines of slaughtered men: By whose proud side the vgly furies run. Harkening when he shall bid them plague the world. Ouer whose Zenith cloth'd in windy aire, And Eagles wings ioin'd to her feathered breast, Fame houereth, sounding of her golden Trumpe: That to the aduerse poles of that straight line, Which measureth the glorious frame of heauen, The name of mightie Tamburlain is spread: And him faire Lady shall thy eies behold. Come. Olim Take pitie of a Ladies ruthfull teares, That humbly craues vpon her knees to stay, And cast her bodie in the burning flame, That feeds vpon her sonnes and husbands flesh. tech. Madam, sooner shall fire consume vs both, Then scortch a face so beautiful as this. In frame of which, Nature hath shewed more skill, Than when she gaue eternall Chaos forme, Drawing from it the shining Lamps of heauen. ther. Madam, I am so far in loue with you, That you must goe with vs, no remedy. Olim. Then carie me I care not where you will, And let the end of this my fatall iourney, Be likewise end to my accursed life. tech. No Madam, but the beginning of your ioy, Come willinglie, therfore. ther. Souldiers now let vs meet the Generall, Who by this time is at Natolia, Ready to charge the army of the Turke.

Cal. My royal army is as great as his, That from the bounds of Phrigia to the sea Which washeth Cyprus with his brinish waues, Couers the hils, the valleies and the plaines.

And guard the gates to entertaine his soule. Cal. Tel me Uiceroies the number of your men, And what our Army royall is esteem'd. Ier. From Palestina and Ierusalem, Of Hebrewes, three score thousand fighting men Are come since last we shewed your maiesty. Orc. So from Arabia desart, and the bounds Of that sweet land, whose braue Metropolis Reedified the faire Semyramis, Came forty thousand warlike foot and horse, Since last we numbred to your Maiesty. treb. From trebizon in Asia the lesse, Naturalized Turks and stout Bythinians Came to my bands full fifty thousand more, That fighting, knowes not what retreat doth meane, Nor ere returne but with the victory, Since last we numbred to your maiesty. Sor. Of Sorians from Halla is repair'd And neighbor cities of your highnesse land, Ten thousand horse, and thirty thousand foot, Since last we numbred to your maiestie: So that the Army royall is esteem'd Six hundred thousand valiant fighting men.

Why, so he is Casane, I am here, But yet Ile saue their liues and make them slaues, Ye petty kings of Turkye I am come, As Hector did into the Grecian campe. To ouerdare the pride of GrÅcia. And set his warlike person to the view Of fierce Achilles, riuall of his fame, I doe you honor in the simile. For if I should as Hector did Achilles, (The worthiest knight that euer brandisht sword) Challenge in combat any of you all, I see how fearfully ye would refuse, And fly my gloue as from a Scorpion. Orc. Now thou art fearfull of thy armies strength, Thou wouldst with ouermatch of person fight, But Shepheards issue, base borne tamburlaine, Thinke of thy end, this sword shall lance thy throat. Tamb.

Cal. Raile not proud Scythian, I shall now reuenge My fathers vile abuses and mine owne. Ier. By Mahomet he shal be tied in chaines, Rowing with Christians in a Brigandine, About the Grecian Isles to rob and spoile: And turne him to his ancient trade againe. Me thinks the slaue should make a lusty theefe. Cal. Nay, when the battaile ends, al we wil meet, And sit in councell to inuent some paine, That most may vex his body and his soule. Tam. Sirha, Callapine, Ile hang a clogge about your necke for running away againe, you shall not trouble me thus to come and fetch you. But as for you (Uiceroy) you shal haue bits, And harnest like my horses, draw my coch: And when ye stay, be lasht with whips of wier, Ile haue you learne to feed on prouander, And in a stable lie vpon the planks: Orc.

Now in their glories shine the golden crownes Of these proud Turks, much like so many suns That halfe dismay the maiesty of heauen: Now brother follow we our fathers sword, That flies with fury swifter than our thoughts, And cuts down armies with his conquerings wings, Cel. Call foorth our laisie brother from the tent, For if my father misse him in the field, Wrath kindled in the furnace of his breast, Wil send a deadly lightening to his heart. Amy. Brother, ho, what, giuen so much to sleep You cannot leaue it, when our enemies drums And ratling cannons thunder in our eares Our proper ruine, and our fathers foile? Cal. Away ye fools, my father needs not me, Nor you in faith, but that you wil be thought More childish valourous than manly wise: If halfe our campe should sit and sleepe with me, My father ware enough to scar the foe: You doo dishonor to his maiesty, To think our helps will doe him any good. Amy. What, dar'st thou then be absent fr? the fight, Knowing my father hates thy cowardise, And oft hath warn'd thee to be stil in field, When he himselfe amidst the thickest troopes Beats downe our foes to flesh our taintlesse swords. Cal. I know sir, what it is to kil a man, It works remorse of conscience in me, I take no pleasure to be murtherous, Nor care for blood when wine wil quench my thirst. Cel. O cowardly boy, fie for shame, come foorth. Thou doost dishonor manhood, and thy house. Cal. Goe, goe tall stripling, fight you for vs both, And take my other toward brother here, For person like to prooue a second Mars, Twill please my mind as wel to heare both you Haue won a heape of honor in the field, And left your slender carkasses behind, As if I lay with you for company. Amy. You wil not goe then? Cal You say true. Amy. Were all the lofty mounts of Zona mundi, That fill the midst of farthest Tartary, Turn'd into pearle and proffered for my stay, I would not bide the furie of my father: When made a victor in these hautie arms. He comes and findes his sonnes haue had no shares In all the honors he proposde for vs. Cal. Take you the honor, I will take my ease, My wisedome shall excuse my cowardise: I goe into the field before I need? Alarme, and Amy. and Celeb. run in. The bullets fly at random where they list. And should I goe and kill a thousand men, I were as soone rewarded with a shot, And sooner far than he that neuer fights. And should I goe and do nor harme nor good, I might haue harme, which all the good I haue Ioin'd with my fathers crowne would neuer cure. Ile to cardes: Perdicas. Perd. Here my Lord. Cal. Come, thou and I wil goe to cardes to driue away the time. Per. Content my Lord, but what shal we play for? Cal. Who shal kisse the fairest of the Turkes Concubines first, when my father hath conquered them. Per. Agreed yfaith. They play. Cal. They say I am a coward, (Perdicas) and I feare as litle their tara, tantaras, their swordes or their cannons, as I doe a naked Lady in a net of golde, and for feare I should be affraid, would put it off and come to bed with me. Per. Such a feare (my Lord) would neuer make yee retire. Cal. I would my father would let me be put in the front of such a battaile once, to trie my valour. Alarme.

Shal we let goe these kings again my Lord To gather greater numbers gainst our power, That they may say, it is not chance doth this, But matchlesse strength and magnanimity. tamb. No, no Amyras, tempt not Fortune so, Cherish thy valour stil with fresh supplies: And glut it not with stale and daunted foes, But wher's this coward, villaine, not my sonne, But traitor to my name and maiesty. He goes in and brings him out. Image of sloth, and and picture of a slaue, The obloquie and skorne of my renowne, How may my hart, thus fired with mine eies, Wounded with shame, and kill'd with discontent, Shrowd any thought may holde my striuing hands From martiall iustice on thy wretched soule. ther.

Good my Lord, let him be forgiuen for once, And we wil force him to the field hereafter. tam. Stand vp my boyes, and I wil teach ye arms, And what the iealousie of warres must doe. O Samarcanda, where I breathed first, And ioy'd the fire of this martiall flesh, Blush, blush faire citie, at thine honors foile, And shame of nature with Iaertis streame, Embracing thee with deepest of his loue, Can neuer wash from thy distained browes. Here Ioue, receiue his fainting soule againe, A Forme not meet to giue that subiect essence, Whose matter is the flesh of Tamburlain, Wherein an incorporeall spirit mooues, Made of the mould whereof thy selfe consists. Which makes me valiant, proud, ambitious, Ready to leuie power against thy throne, That I might mooue the turning Spheares of heau?, For earth and al this aery region Cannot containe the state of Tamburlaine. By Mahomet, thy mighty friend I sweare, In sending to my issue such a soule, Created of the massy dregges of earth, The scum and tartar of the Elements, Wherein was neither corrage, strength or wit, But follie, sloth, and damned idlenesse: Thou hast procur'd a greater enemie, Than he that darted mountaines at thy head, Shaking the burthen mighty Atlas beares: Whereat thou trembling hid'st thee in the aire. Cloth'd with a pitchy cloud for being seene. And now ye cankred curres of Asia, That will not see the strength of Tamburlaine, Although it shine as brightly as the Sun. Now you shal feele the strength of Tamburlain, And by the state of his supremacie, Approoue the difference twixt himself and you. Orc. Thou shewest the difference twixt our selues and thee. In this thy barbarous damned tyranny. Ier. Thy victories are growne so violent, That shortly heauen, fild with the meteors Of blood and fire thy tyrannies haue made, Will poure down blood and fire on thy head: Whose scalding drops wil pierce thy seething braines, And with our bloods, reuenge our bloods on thee. Tamb. Uillaines, these terrours and these tyrannies (If tyrannies wars iustice ye repute) I execute, enioin'd me from aboue: To scourge the pride of such as heauen abhors, Nor am I made Arch-monark of the world, Crown'd and inuested by the hand of Ioue, For deeds of bounty or nobility: But since I exercise a greater name, The Scourge of God and terrour of the world, I must apply my selfe to fit those tearmes, In war, in blood, in death, in crueltie, And plague such Pesants as resisting me, The power of heauens eternall maiesty. Theridamas, techelles, and Casane, Ransacke the tents and the pauilions Of these proud Turks, and take their Concubines. Making them burie this effeminate brat, For not a common Souldier shall defile His manly fingers with so faint a boy. Then bring those Turkish harlots to my tent, And Ile dispose them as it likes me best, Meane while take him in. Soul. We will my Lord. Ier. O damned monster, nay a Feend of Hell, Whose cruelties are not so harsh as thine, Nor yet imposd, with such a bitter hate. Orc. Reuenge it Radamanth and Eacus, And let your hates extended in his paines, Expell the hate wherewith he paines our soules. treb. May neuer day giue vertue to his eies, Whose sight composde of furie and of fire Doth send such sterne affections to his heart, Sor. May neuer spirit, vaine or Artier feed The cursed substance of that cruel heart, But (wanting moisture and remorsefull blood) Drie vp with anger, and consume with heat. tam. Wel, bark ye dogs, Ile bridle al your tongues And bind them close with bits of burnisht steele, Downe to the channels of your hatefull throats, And with the paines my rigour shall inflict, Ile make ye roare, that earth may eccho foorth The far resounding torments ye sustaine, As when an heard of lusty Cymbrian Buls, Run mourning round about, the Femals misse, And stung with furie of their following, Fill all the aire with troublous bellowing: I will with Engines, neuer exercisde, Conquer, sacke, and vtterly consume Your cities and your golden pallaces, And with the flames that beat against the clowdes Incense the heauens. and make the starres to melt, As if they were the teares of Mahomet For hot consumption of his countries pride: And til by vision, or by speach I heare Immortall Ioue say, Cease my Tamburlaine, I will persist a terrour to the world, Making the Meteors, that like armed men Are seene to march vpon the towers of heauen, Run tilting round about the firmament, And breake their burning Lances in the aire, For honor of my woondrous victories. Come bring them in to our Pauilion. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na. 3, Olympia alone. Distrest Olympia, whose weeping eies Since thy arriuall here beheld no Sun, But closde within the compasse of a tent, Hath stain'd thy cheekes, &amp; made thee look like death Deuise some meanes to rid thee of thy life. Rather than yeeld to his detested suit, Whose drift is onely to dishonor thee. And since this earth, dew'd with thy brinish teares, Affoords no hearbs, whose taste may poison thee, Nor yet this aier, beat often with thy sighes, Contagious smels, and vapors to infect thee, Nor thy close Caue a sword to murther thee, Let this inuention be the instrument. Enter Theridamas. The. Wel met Olympia, I sought thee in my tent But when I saw the place obscure and darke, Which with thy beauty thou wast woont to light, Enrag'd, I ran about the fields for thee, Supposing, amorous Ioue had sent his sonne, The winged Hermes, to conuay thee hence: But now I finde thee, and that feare is past. Tell me Olympia, wilt thou graunt my suit? Olym. My Lord and husbandes death, with my sweete sons, With whom I buried al affections, Saue griefe and sorrow which torment my heart, Forbids my mind to entertaine a thought That tends to loue, but meditate on death, A fitter subiect for a pensiue soule. Ther. Olympia, pitie him, in whom thy looks Haue greater operation and more force Than Cynthias in the watery wildernes, For with thy view my ioyes are at the full, And eb againe, as thou departst from me. Olim. Ah, pity me my Lord, and draw your sword, Making a passage for my troubled soule, Which beates against this prison to get out, And meet my husband and my louing sonne. ther. Nothing, but stil thy husband and thy sonne? Leaue this my Loue, and listen more to me, Thou shalt be stately Queene of faire Argier, And cloth'd in costly cloath of massy gold, Upon the marble turrets of my Court Sit like to Venus in her chaire of state, Commanding all thy princely eie desires, And I will cast off armes and sit with thee, Spending my life in sweet discourse of loue. Olym. No such discourse is pleasant in mine eares, But that where euery period ends with death, And euery line begins with death againe: I cannot loue to be an Emperesse. ther. Nay Lady, then if nothing wil preuaile, Ile vse some other means to make you yeeld, Such is the sodaine fury of my loue, I must and wil be pleasde, and you shall yeeld: Come to the tent againe. Olym. Stay good my Lord, and wil you saue my honor, Ile giue your Grace a present of such price, As all the world cannot affoord the like. ther. What is it. Olym. An ointment which a cunning Alcumist Distilled from the purest Balsamum, And simplest extracts of all Minerals, In which the essentiall fourme of Marble stone, Tempered by science metaphisicall, And Spels of magicke from the mouthes of spirits, With which if you but noint your tender Skin, Nor Pistol, Sword, nor Lance can pierce your flesh. Ther. Why Madam, thinke ye to mocke me thus palpably? Olim. To prooue it, I mil noint my naked throat, Which when you stab, looke on your weapons point, And you shall se't rebated with the blow. ther. Why gaue you not your husband some of it, if you loued him, and it so precious? Olym. My purpose was (my Lord) to spend it so, But was preuented by his sodaine end. And for a present easie proofe hereof, That I dissemble not, trie it on me, ther. I wil Olympia, and will keep it for The richest present of this Easterne world. She noints her throat. Olym. Now stab my Lord, and mark your weapons point That wil be blunted if the blow be great. ther. Here then Olympia. What, haue I slaine her? Uillaine, stab thy selfe: Cut off this arme that murthered my Loue: In whom the learned Rabies of this age, Might find as many woondrous myracles, As in the Theoria of the world. Now Hell is fairer than Elisian, A greater Lamp than that bright eie of heauen, From whence the starres doo borrow all their light, Wanders about the black circumference, And now the damned soules are free from paine, For euery Fury gazeth on her lookes: Infernall Dis is courting of my Loue, Inuenting maskes and stately showes for her, Opening the doores of his rich treasurie, To entertaine this Queene of chastitie, Whose body shall be tomb'd with all the pompe The treasure of my kingdome may affoord. Exit, taking her away. ScÃ¦na. 4. Tamburlaine drawen in his chariot by Trebizon and Soria with bittes in their mouthes, reines in his left hand, in his right h?d a whip, with which he scourgeth them, Techelles, Theridamas, Vsumeasane, Amyras, Celebinus: Natolia, and Ierusalem led by with fiue or six common souldiers. Tam. Holla, ye pampered Iades of Asia: What, can ye draw but twenty miles a day, And haue so proud a chariot at your heeles, And such a Coachman as great Tamburlaine? But from Asphaltis, where I conquer'd you, To Byron here where thus I honor you? The horse that guide the golden eie of heauen, And blow the morning from their nosterils, Making their fiery gate aboue the cloudes, Are not so honoured in their Gouernour, As you (ye slaues) in mighty Tamburlain. The headstrong Iades of Thrace, Alcides tam'd, That King Egeus fed with humaine flesh, And made so wanton that they knew their strengths, Were not subdew'd with valour more diuine, Than you by this vnconquered arme of mine. To make you fierce, and fit my appetite, You shal be fed with flesh as raw as blood, And drinke in pailes the strongest Muscadell: If you can liue with it, then liue, and draw My chariot swifter than the racking cloudes: If not, then dy like beasts, and fit for nought But perches for the black and fatall Rauens. Thus am I right the Scourge of highest Ioue, And see the figure of my dignitie, By which I hold my name and maiesty. Ami. Let me haue coach my Lord, that I may ride, And thus be drawen with these two idle kings. tam. Thy youth forbids such ease my kingly boy, They shall to morrow draw my chariot, While these their fellow kings may be refresht, Orc. O thou that swaiest the region vnder earth, And art a king as absolute as Ioue, Come as thou didst in fruitfull Scicilie, Suruaieng all the glories of the land: And as thou took'st the faire Proserpina, Ioying the fruit of Ceres garden plot, For loue, for honor, and to make her Queene, So for iust hate, for shame, and to subdew This proud contemner of thy dreadfull power, Come once in furie and suruay his pride, Haling him headlong to the lowest hell. ther. Your Maiesty must get some byts for these, To bridle their contemptuous cursing tongues, That like vnruly neuer broken Iades, Breake through the hedges of their hateful mouthes, And passe their fixed boundes exceedingly. Tech. Nay, we wil break the hedges of their mouths And pul their kicking colts out of their pastures, Vsu Your Maiesty already hath deuisde A meane, as fit as may be to restraine These coltish coach-horse tongues from blasphemy. Cel. How like you that sir king? why speak you not? Ier. Ah cruel Brat, sprung from a tyrants loines, How like his cursed father he begins, To practize tauntes and bitter tyrannies? Tam. I Turke, I tel thee, this same Boy is he, That must (aduaunst in higher pompe than this) Rifle the kingdomes I shall leaue vnsackt. If Ioue esteeming me too good for earth, Raise me to match the faire Aldeboran, Aboue the threefold Astracisme of heauen, Before I conquere all the triple world. Now fetch me out the Turkish Concubines, I will prefer them for the funerall They haue bestowed on my abortiue sonne. The Concubines are brought in. Where are my common souldiers now that fought So Lion-like vpon Asphaltis plaines? Soul. Here my Lord. Tam. Hold ye tal souldiers, take ye Queens apeece (I meane such Queens as were kings Concubines) Take them, deuide them and their iewels too, And let them equally serue all your turnes. Soul. We thank your maiesty. tam. Brawle not (I warne yon) for your lechery, For euery man that so offends shall die, Orc. Iniurious tyrant, wilt thou so defame The hatefull fortunes of thy victory, To exercise vpon such guiltlesse Dames, The violence of thy common Souldiours lust. Tam. Liue content then (ye slaues) and meet not me With troopes of harlots at your sloothful heeles Lad. O pity vs my Lord, and saue our honours. tam. Are ye not gone ye villaines with your spoiles? They run away with the Ladies. Ier. O mercilesse infernall cruelty. Tam. Saue your honours? twere but time indeed, Lost long before you knew what honour meant. ther. It seemes they meant to conquer vs my Lord, And make vs ieasting Pageants for their Trulles. tam. And now themselues shal make our Pageant, And common souldiers iest with all their Truls, Let them take pleasure soundly in their spoiles, Till we prepare our martch to Babylon, Whether we next make expedition. tech. Let vs not be idle then my Lord, But presently be prest to conquer it. tam. We wil techelles, forward then ye Iades: Now crowch ye kings of greatest Asia, And tremble when ye heare this Scourge wil come, That whips downe cities, and controwleth crownes, Adding their wealth and treasure to my store, The Euxine sea North to Natolia, The Terrene west, the Caspian north north-east, And on the south Senus Arabicus. Shal al be loden with the martiall spoiles We will conuay with vs to Persea. Then shal my natiue city Samarcanda And christall waues of fresh Iaertis streame, The pride and beautie of her princely seat, Be famous through the furthest continents, For there my Pallace royal shal be plac'd: Whose shyning Turrets shal dismay the heauens, And cast the fame of Ilions Tower to hell. Thorow the streets with troops of conquered kings, Ile ride in golden armour like the Sun, And in my helme a triple plume shal spring, Spangled with Diamonds dancing in the aire, To note me Emperour of the three fold world. Like to an almond tree ymounted high, Upon the lofty and celestiall mount, Of euery greene Selinus queintly dect With bloomes more white than Hericinas browes, Whose tender blossoms tremble euery one, At euery litle breath that thorow heauen is blowen: Then in my coach like Saturnes royal son, Mounted his shining chariots, gilt with fire. And drawen with princely Eagles through the path, Pau'd with bright Christall, and enchac'd with starres, When all the Gods stand gazing at his pomp. So will I ride through Samarcanda streets, Until my soule disseuered from this flesh, Shall mount the milk-white way and meet him there. To Babylon my Lords, to Babylon. Exeunt.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus. 5. ScÃ¦na. I. Enter the Gouernour of Babylon vpon the walles with others. Gouer. What saith Maximus? Max. My Lord, the breach the enimie hath made Giues such assurance of our ouerthrow, That litle hope is left to saue our liues, Or hold our citie from the Conquerours hands. Then hang out flagges (my Lord of humble truce, And satisfie the peoples generall praiers, That Tamburlains intollorable wrath May be supprest by our submission. Gou. Uillaine, respects thou more thy slauish life, Than honor of thy countrie or thy name? Is not my life and state as deere to me, The citie and my natiue countries weale, As any thing of price with thy conceit? Haue we not hope, for all our battered walles, To liue secure, and keep his forces out, When this our famous lake of Limnasphaltis Makes walles a fresh with euery thing that falles Into the liquid substance of his streame, More strong than are the gates of death or hel. What faintnesse should dismay our courages, When we are thus defenc'd against our Foe, And haue no terrour but his threatning lookes? Enter another, kneeling to the Gouernour. My Lord, if euer you did deed of ruth, And now will work a refuge to our liues, Offer submission, hang vp flags of truce, That Tamburlaine may pitie our distresse, And vse vs like a louing Conquerour, Though this be held his last daies dreadfull siege, Wherein he spareth neither man nor child, Yet are there Christians of Georgia here, Whose state he euer pitied and relieu'd: Wil get his pardon if your grace would send. Gouer. How is my soule enuironed, And this eternisde citie Babylon, Fill'd with a packe of faintheart Fugitiues, That thus intreat their shame and seruitude? Another. My Lord, if euer you wil win our hearts, Yeeld vp the towne, saue our wiues and children: For I wil cast my selfe from off these walles, Or die some death of quickest violence, Before I bide the wrath of Tamburlaine. Gouer. Uillaines, cowards, Traitors to our state, Fall to the earth, and pierce the pit of Hel, That legions of tormenting spirits may vex Your slauish bosomes with continuall paines, I care not, nor the towne will neuer yeeld As long as any life is in my breast. Enter Theridamas and Techelles, with other souldiers. Thou desperate Gouernour of Babylon, To saue thy life, and vs a litle labour, Yeeld speedily the citie to our hands, Or els be sure thou shalt be forc'd with paines, More exquisite than euer Traitor felt. Gou. Tyrant, I turne the traitor in thy throat, And wil defend it in despight of thee. Call vp the souldiers to defend these wals. tech. Yeeld foolish Gouernour, we offer more Than euer pet we did to such proud slaues, As durst resist vs till our third daies siege: Thou seest vs prest to giue the last assault, And that shal bide no more regard of parlie. Gou. Assault and spare not, we wil neuer yeeld. Alarme, and they scale the walles. Enter Tamburlain, with Vsumeasane, Amyras, and Celebinus, with others, the two spare kings. Tam. The stately buildings of faire Babylon, Whose lofty Pillers, higher than the cloudes, Were woont to guide the seaman in the deepe. Being caried thither by the cannons force, Now fil the mouth of Limnasphaltes lake, And make a bridge vnto the battered walles, Where Belus, Ninus and great Alexander Haue rode in triumph, triumphs Tamburlaine, Whose chariot wheeles haue hurst th'Assirians bones, Drawen with these kings on heaps of carkasses, Now in the place where faire Semiramis, Courted by kings and peeres of Asia, Hath trode the Meisures, do my souldiers martch, And in the streets, where braue Assirian Dames Haue rid in pompe like rich Saturnia, With furious words and frowning visages, My horsmen brandish their vnruly blades. Enter Theridamas and Techelles bringing the Gouernor of Babylon. Who haue ye there my Lordes? Ther. The sturdy Gouernour of Babylon, That made vs all the labour for the towne, And vsde such slender reckning of you maiesty. tam. Go bind the villaine, he shall hang in chaines, Upon the ruines of this conquered towne, Sirha, the view of our vermillion tents, Which threatned more than if the region Next vnderneath the Element of fire, Were full of Commets and of blazing stars, Whose flaming traines should reach down to the earth Could not affright you, no, nor I my selfe, The wrathfull messenger of mighty Ioue, That with his sword hath quail'd all earthly kings, Could not perswade you to submission, But stil the ports were shut: villaine I say, Should I but touch the rusty gates of hell, The triple headed Cerberus would howle, And wake blacke Ioue to crouch and kneele to me, But I haue sent volleies of shot to you, Yet could not enter till the breach was made, Gou. Nor if my body could haue stopt the breach, Shouldst thou haue entred, cruel tamburlaine: Tis not thy bloody tents can make me yeeld, Nor yet thy selfe, the anger of the highest, For though thy cannon shooke the citie walles, My heart did neuer quake, or corrage faint. tam. Wel, now Ile make it quake, go draw him vp, Hang him vp in chaines vpon the citie walles, And let my souldiers shoot the slaue to death. Gouern. Uile monster, borne of some infernal hag, And sent from hell to tyrannise on earth, Do all thy wurst, nor death, nor Tamburlaine, Torture or paine can daunt my dreadlesse minde. tam. Up with him then, his body shalbe scard. Gou But Tamburlain, in Lymnasphaltis lake, There lies more gold than Babylon is worth, Which when the citie was besieg'd I hid, Saue but my life and I wil giue it thee. tam. Then for all your valour, you would saue your life, Where about lies it? Gou. Under a hollow bank, right opposite Against the Westerne gate of Babylon. tam Go thither some of you and take his gold, The rest forward with execution, Away with him hence, let him speake no more: I think I make your courage something quaile, When this is done, we'll martch from Babylon, And make our greatest haste to Persea: These Iades are broken winded, and halfe tyr'd, Unharnesse them, and let me haue fresh horse: So, now their best is done to honour me, Take them, and hang them both vp presently. Tre. Uild Tyrant, barbarous bloody Tamburlain Tamb. Take them away Theridamas, see them dispatcht. Ther I will my Lord. tam. Come Asian Uiceroies, to your taskes a while And take such fortune as your fellowes felt. Orc. First let thy Scythyan horse teare both our limmes Rather then we should draw thy chariot. And like base slaues abiect out princely mindes To vile and ignominious seruitude. Ier. Rather lend me thy weapon Tamburlain, That I may sheath it in this breast of mine, A thousand deathes could not torment our hearts More than the thought of this dooth vexe our soules. Amy. They will talk still my Lord, if you doe not bridle them. tam. Bridle them, and let me to my coach. They bridle them. Amy. See now my Lord how braue the Captaine hangs. tam. Tis braue indeed my boy, wel done, Shoot first my Lord, and then the rest shall follow, ther. Then haue at him to begin withall. Theridamas shootes. Gou. Yet saue my life, and let this wound appease The mortall furie of great Tamburlain. tam. No, though Asphaltis lake were liquid gold, And offer'd me as ransome for thy life, Yet shouldst thou die, shoot at him all at once. They shoote. So now he hangs like Bagdets Gouernour, Hauing as many bullets in his flesh, As there be breaches in her battered wall. Goe now and bind the Burghers hand and foot, And cast them headlong in the cities lake: Tartars and Perseans shall inhabit there, And to command the citie, I will build A Cytadell, that all Affrica Which hath bene subiect to the Persean king, Shall pay me tribute for, in Babylon. tech. What shal be done with their wiues and children my Lord. tam, Techelles, Drowne them all, man, woman, and child, Leaue not a Babylonian in the towne. tech I will about it straight, come Souldiers. Exit tam. Now Casane, wher's the Turkish Alcaron, And all the heapes of supersticious bookes, Found in the Temples of that Mahomet? Whom I haue thought a God, they shal be burnt. Cas. Here they are my Lord. tam. Wel said, let there be a fire presently, In vaine I see men worship Mahomet, My sword hath sent millions of Turks to hell. Slew all his Priests, his kinsmen, and his friends, And yet I liue vntoucht by Mahomet: There is a God full of reuenging wrath, From whom the thunder and the lightning breaks, Whose Scourge I am, and him will I obey. So Casane, fling them in the fire. Now Mahomet, if thou haue any power, Come downe thy selfe and worke a myracle, Thou art not woorthy to be worshipped, That suffers flames of fire to burne the writ Wherein the sum of thy religion rests. Why send'st thou not a furious whyrlwind downe, To blow thy Alcaron vp to thy throne, Where men report, thou sitt'st by God himselfe, Or vengeance on the head of Tamburlain, That shakes his sword against thy maiesty. And spurns the Abstracts of thy foolish lawes. Wel souldiers, Mahomet remaines in hell, He cannot heare the voice of Tamburlain, Seeke out another Godhead to adore, The God that sits in heauen, if any God, For he is God alone, and none but he. tech. I haue fulfil'd your highnes wil, my Lord, Thousands of men drown'd in Asphaltis Lake, Haue made the water swell aboue the bankes, And fishes feed by humaine carkasses, Amasde, swim vp and downe vpon the waues, As when they swallow Assafitida, Which makes them fleet aloft and gaspe for aire, tam. Wel then my friendly Lordes, what now remaines But that we leaue sufficient garrison And presently depart to Persea, To triumph after all our victories. ther. I, good my Lord, let vs in hast to Persea, And let this Captaine be remoou'd the walles, To some high hill about the citie here. tam. Let it be so, about it souldiers: But stay, I feele my selfe distempered sudainly. tech. What is it dares distemper Tamburlain? tam. Something tcchelles but I know not what, But foorth ye vassals, what so ere it be, Sicknes or death can neuer conquer me. Exeunt ScÃ¦na. 4. Enter Callapine, Amasia, with drums and trumpets. Callap. King of Amasia, now our mighty hoste, Marcheth in Asia maior where the streames, Of Euphrates and Tigris swiftly runs, And here may we behold great Babylon, Circled about with Limnasphaltis Lake, Where tamburlaine with all his armie lies, Which being faint and weary with the siege, Wee may lie ready to encounter him. Before his hoste be full from Babylon, And so reuenge our latest grieuous losse, If God or Mahomet send any aide. Ama. Doubt not my lord, but we shal conquer him The Monster that hath drunke a sea of blood, And yet gapes stil for more to quench his thirst, Our Turkish swords shal headlong send to hell, And that vile Carkasse drawne by warlike kings, The Foules shall eate, for neuer sepulchre Shall grace that base-borne Tyrant tamburlaine. Cal. When I record my Parents slauish life, Their cruel death, mine owne captiuity, My Uiceroies bondage vnder tamburlaine, Me thinks I could sustaine a thousand deaths, To be reueng'd of all his Uillanie. Ah sacred Mahomet, thou that hast seene, Millions of Turkes perish by Tamburlaine, Kingdomes made waste, braue cities sackt &amp; burnt, And but one hoste is left to honor thee. Aid thy obedient seruant Callapine. And make him after all these ouerthrowes, To triumph ouer cursed Tamburlaine. Ama Feare not my Lord, I see great Mahomet Clothed in purple clowdes, and on his head A Chaplet brighter than Apollos crowne, Marching about the ayer with armed men, To ioine with you against this Tamburlaine. Renowmed Generall mighty Callapine, Though God himselfe and holy Mahomet, Should come in person to resist your power, Yet might your mighty hoste incounter all, And pull proud Tamburlaine vpon his knees, To sue for mercie at your highnesse feete, Cal. Captaine the force of Tamburlaine is great, His fortune greater, and the victories Wherewith he hath so sore dismaide the world, Are greatest to discourage all our drifts, Yet when the pride of Cynthia is at full, She waines againe, and so shall his I hope, For we haue here the chiefe selected men Of twenty seuerall kingdomes at the least: Nor plowman, Priest, nor Merchant staies at home, All Turkie is in armes with Callapine. And neuer wil we sunder camps and armes, Before himselfe or his be conquered. This is the time that must eternize me, For conquering the Tyrant of the world. Come Souldiers, let vs lie in wait for him And if we find him absent from his campe, Or that it be reioin'd again at full, Assaile it and be sure of victorie. Exeunt. ScÃ¦na. 6. Theridamas, Techelles, Vsumeasane. Weepe heauens, and vanish into liquid teares Fal starres that gouerne his natiuity, And sommon al the shining lamps of heauen To cast their bootlesse fires to the earth. And shed their feble influence in the aire. Muffle your beauties with eternall clowdes, For hell and darknesse pitch their pitchy tentes, And Death with armies of Cymerian spirits Giues battile gainst the heart of Tamburlaine, Now in defiance of that woonted loue, Your sacred vertues pour'd vpon his throne, And made his state an honor to the heauens, These cowards inuisiblie assaile hys soule, And threaten conquest on our Soueraigne: But if he die, your glories are disgrac'd, Earth droopes and saies, that hell in heauen is plac'd. tech. O then ye Powers that sway eternal seates, And guide this massy substance of the earthe, If you retaine desert of holinesse, As your supreame estates instruct our thoughtes, Be not inconstant, carelesse of your fame, Beare not the burthen of your enemies ioyes, Triumphing in his fall whom you aduaunst, But as his birth, life, health and maiesty Were strangely blest and gouerned by heauen, So honour heauen til heauen dissolued be, His byrth, his life, his health and maiesty. Cas.. Blush heauen to loose the honor of thy name, To see thy foot-stoole set vpon thy head, And let no basenesse in thy haughty breast, Sustaine a shame of such inexcellence: To see the deuils mount in Angels throanes, And Angels diue into the pooles of hell. And though they think their painfull date is out, And that their power is puissant as Ioues, Which makes them manage armes against thy state, Yet make them feele the strength of Tamburlain, Thy instrument and note of Maisty. Is greater far, than they can thus subdue. For if he die, thy glorie is disgrac'd, Earth droopes and saies that hel in heauen is plac'd tam. What daring God torments my body thus, And seeks to conquer mighty Tamburlaine, Shall sicknesse prooue me now to be a man, That haue bene tearm'd the terrour of the world? Techelles and the rest, come take your swords, And threaten him whose hand afflicts my soul, Come let vs march against the powers of heauen, And set blacke streamers in the firmament, To signifie the slaughter of the Gods, Ah friends, what shal I doe I cannot stand, Come carie me to war against the Gods, That thus inuie the health of Tamburlaine, ther. Ah good my Lord, leaue these impatient words, Which ad much danger to your malladie. tam. Why shal I sit and languish in this paine, No, strike the drums, and in reuenge of this, Come let vs chardge our speares and pierce his breast, Whose shoulders beare the Axis of the world, That if I perish, heauen and earth may fade, theridamas, haste to the court of Ioue, Will him to send Apollo hether straight, To cure me, or Ile fetch him downe my selfe. tech. Sit stil my gratious Lord, this griefe wil cease. And cannot last, it is so violent. tam. Not last techelles, no, for I shall die, See where my slaue, the vglie monster death Shaking and quiuering, pale and wan for feare, Stands aiming at me with his murthering dart, Who flies away at euery glance I giue, And when I look away, comes stealing on: Uillaine away, and hie thee to the field, I and myne armie come to lode thy barke With soules of thousand mangled carkasses, Looke where he goes, but see, he comes againe Because I stay, techelles let vs march, And weary Death with bearing soules to hell. Phi. Pleaseth your Maiesty to drink this potion. Which wil abate the furie of your fit, And cause some milder spirits gouerne you. tam. Tel me, what think you of my sicknes now? Phi. I view'd your vrine, and the Hipostates Thick and obscure doth make your danger great, Your vaines are full of accidentall heat, Whereby the moisture of your blood is dried, The Humidum and Calor, which some holde Is not a parcell of the Elements, But of a substance more diuine and pure, Is almost cleane extinguished and spent. Which being the cause of life, imports your death. Besides my Lord, this day is Criticall, Dangerous to those, whose Chrisis is as yours: Your Artiers which alongst the vaines conuey The liuely spirits which the heart ingenders Are partcht and void of spirit that the soule Wanting those Organnons by which it mooues, Can not indure by argument of art, Yet if your maiesty may escape this day, No doubt, but you shal soone recouer all. tam. Then will I comfort all my vital parts, And liue in spight of death aboue a day. Alarme within. Mess. My Lord, yong Callapine that lately fled from your maiesty, hath nowe gathered a fresh Armie, and hearing your absence in the field, offers to set vpon vs presently. Tam. See my Phisitions now, how Ioue hath sent A present medicince to recure my paine: My looks shall make them flie, and might I follow, There should not one of all the villaines power Liue to giue offer of another fight. Vsum. I ioy my Lord, your highnesse is so strong, That can endure so well your royall presence, Which onely will dismay the enemy. Tam. I know it wil Casane: draw you slaues, In spight of death I will goe show my face. Alarme, Tamb. goes in, and comes out againe with al the rest. Thus are the villaines, cowards fled for feare, Like Summers vapours, vanisht by the Sun. And could I but a while pursue the field, That Callapine should be my slaue againe. But I perceiue my martial strength is spent, In vaine I striue and raile against those powers, That meane t'inuest me in a higher throane, As much too high for this disdainfull earth. Giue me a Map, then let me see how much Is left for me to conquer all the world, That these my boies may finish all my wantes, One brings a Map. Here I began to martch towards Persea, Along Armenia and the Caspian sea, And thence vnto Bythinia, where I tooke The Turke and his great Empresse prisoners, Then martcht I into Egypt and Arabia, And here not far from Alexandria, Whereas the Terren and the red sea meet, Being distant lesse than ful a hundred leagues, I meant to cut a channell to them both, That men might quickly saile to India. From thence to Nubia neere Borno Lake, And so along the Ethiopian sea, Cutting the Tropicke line of Capricorne, I conquered all as far as Zansibar, Then by the Northerne part of Affrica. I came at last to GrÃ¦cia, and from thence To Asia, where I stay against my will, Which is from Scythia, where I first began, Backeward and forwards nere fiue thousand leagues, Looke here my boies, see what a world of ground, Lies westward from the midst of Cancers line, Unto the rising of this earthly globe, Whereas the Sun declining from our sight, Begins the day with our Antypodes: And shall I die, and this vnconquered? Loe here my sonnes, are all the golden Mines, Inestimable drugs and precious stones, More worth Asia, and the world beside, And from th'Antartique Pole, Eastward behold As much more land, which neuer was descried, Wherein are rockes of Pearle, that shine as kright As all the Lamps that beautifie the Sky, And shal I die, and this vnconquered? Here louely boies, what death forbids my life, That let your liues commaund in spight of death. Amy. Alas my Lord, how should our bleeding harts Wounded and broken with your Highnesse griefe, Retaine a thought of ioy, or sparke of life? Your soul giues essence to our wretched subiects. Whose matter is incorporoat in your flesh. Cel. Your paines do pierce our soules, no hope suruiues, For by your life we entertaine our liues, tam. But sons, this subiect not of force enough, To hold the fiery spirit it containes, must part, imparting his impressions, By equall portions into both your breasts: My flesh deuided in your precious shapes, Shal still retaine my spirit, though I die, And liue in all your seedes immortally: Then now remooue me, that I may resigne My place and proper tytle to my sonne: First take my Scourge and my imperiall Crowne, And mount my royall chariot of estate, That I may see thee crown'd before I die, Help me (my Lords) to make my last remooue. ther. A woful change my Lord, that daunts our thoughts, More the ruine of our proper soules. tam. Sit vp my sonne, let me see how well Thou wilt become thy fathers maiestie. They crowne him. Ami. With what a flinty bosome should I ioy, The breath of life, and burthen of my soule, If not resolu'd into resolued paines, My bodies mortified lineaments should exercise the motions of my heart, Pierc'd with the ioy of any dignity? O father, if the vnrelenting eares Of death and hell be shut against my praiers, And that the spightfull influence of heauen. Denie my soule fruition of her ioy, How should I step or stir my hatefull feete, Against the inward powers of my heart, Leading a life that onely striues to die, And plead in vaine, vnpleasing souerainty. tam. Let not thy loue exceed thyne honor sonne, Nor bar thy mind that magnanimitie, That nobly must admit necessity: Sit vp my boy, and with those silken raines, Bridle the steeled stomackes of those Iades. ther. My Lord, you must obey his maiesty, Since Fate commands, and proud necessity. Amy. Heauens witnes me, with what a broken hart And damned spirit I ascend this seat, And send my soule before my father die, His anguish and his burning agony. tam. Now fetch the hearse of faire Zenocrate, Let it be plac'd by this my fatall chaire, And serue as parcell of my funerall. Cas Then feeles your maiesty no soueraigne ease, Nor may our hearts all drown'd in teares of blood, Ioy any hope of your recouery? tamb. Casane no, the Monarke of the earth, And eielesse Monster that torments my soule, Cannot behold the teares ye shed for me, And therefore stil augments his cruelty. tech. Then let some God oppose his holy power, Against the wrath and tyranny of death, That his teare-thyrsty and vnquenched hate, May be vpon himselfe reuerberate. They bring in the hearse. tam Now eies, inioy your latest benefite, And when my soule hath vertue of your sight, Pierce through the coffin and the sheet of gold, And glut your longings with a heauen of ioy. So, raigne my sonne, scourge and controlle those slaues Guiding thy chariot with thy Fathers hand. As precious is the charge thou vndertak'st As that which Clymeus brainsicke sonne did guide, When wandring PhÅbes Iuory cheeks were scortcht And all the earth like AEtna breathing fire: Be warn'd by him, then learne with awfull eie To sway a throane as dangerous as his: For if thy body thriue not full of thoughtes As pure and fiery as Phyteus beames, The nature of these proud rebelling Iades Wil take occasion by the slenderest haire, And draw thee peecemeale like Hyppolitus, Through rocks more steepe and sharp than Caspian cliftes. The nature of thy chariot wil not beare A guide of baser temper than my selfe, More then heauens coach, the pride of Phaeton. Farewell my boies, my dearest friends, farewel, My body feeles, my soule dooth weepe to see Your sweet desires depriu'd my company, For Tamburlaine, the Scourge of God must die. Amy. Meet heauen &amp; earth, &amp; here let al things end For earth hath spent the pride of all her fruit, And heauen consum'd his choisest liuing fire. Let earth and heauen his timelesse death deplore, For both their woorths wil equall him no more. FINIS.</field>
