      <field name="fulltext">Enter king Edward, Howard, Sellinger, and Soldiers marching. Edward. Is this the aide our Cosin Burgundie, And the great Constable of France assured vs? Haue we marched thus far through the hart of France? And with the terror of our English Drums: Rouzde the poor trembling French, which leaue their towns That now the Wolues affrighted from the fieldes, Do get their pray, and kennell in their streetes? Our thundring Canons, now this fortnight space, Like common Bell-men in some market towne: Haue cryed the Constable and Burgundie, But yet I see they come not to our aide, Weele bring them in, or by the blessed light, Weele search the Ground-silles of their Cittie walles, Since you haue brought me hether: I will make, The proudest Tower that stands in France to quake, I maruaile Scales returnes not, for by him I doe respect to heare their resolutions. Enter the Lord Scales. How. My Soueraigne he is happelie returnde. Ed. Welcome my Lord, welcome good Cosin Scales, What newes from Burgundie, what is his answere? What comes he to our succour as he promised? Scales. Not by his goodwil, for ought that I can see He lingers still in his long siedge at Nuse. I vrgd his promise and your expectation, Euen to the force and compas of my spirite, I cheerd my firme perswasions, with your hopes, And gylded them with my best Oratorie, I framde my speech still fitly as I found The temper of his humor, to be wrought vpon, But stil I found him earthy, vnresolute, Muddy, and me thought euer through his eyes, I saw his wauering and vnsetled spirite, And to be short, subtile and trecherous, And one that doth entend no good to you, And he will come, and yet he wanteth power, He would fayne come, but may not leaue the siedge, He hopes he shall, but yet he knowes not when, He purposed, but some impedimentes, Haue hindred his determined intent, Briefly, I thinke he will not come at all. Ed. But is he like to take the towne of Nuse. Sca. My Lord the towne is liker to take him, That if he chance to come to you at all, Ti's but for succour. Ed. But what sayes Count Saint Paule? Scales. My Lord he lies, and reuelles at S. Quintens, And laughes at Edwardes comming into France, There Dominering with his drunken crue, Make Iigges of vs, and in their slauering Iestes, Tell how like Rogues we lie here in the field, Then comes a slaue one of those drunken sottes, In with a Tauerne reckoning for a supplication, Disguised with a cushion on his head, A Drawers Apron for a Heraldes Coate, And tels the Count, the king of England craues One of his worthy honors Dog-kennels, To be his lodging for a day or two. With some such other Tauerne foolerie: With that this filthy rascall greasie rout, Brast out in laughter at this worthy iest, Neighing like horses: thus the Count Saint Paul Regardes his promise to your Maiestie. Ed. Will no man thrust the slaue into a Sackbut: Sel. Now by this light were I but neer the slaue With a blacke Iacke I would beat out his braines. Ho. If it please your Highnes but to say the word, Weele plucke him out of Quintens by the eares. Ed. No cosin Howard, weele reserue our valour, For better purpose, since they both refuse vs, Our selues will be vnriuallde in our honor. Now our first cast my Lord is at maine France, Whilst yet our Army is in health and strong, And haue we once but broke vnto that warre, I wil not leaue S. Paule, nor Burgundy, Not a bare Pigscoate to shroud them in. Heraulde. He. My Soueraigne. Ed. Goe Herauld, and to Lewes the French king, Denounce sterne warre, and tell him I am come, To take possession of my realme of France. Defie him boldly from vs, be thy voice As fierce as thunder, to affright his soule: Herauld be gone I say, and be thy breath, Percing as lightning, and thy words as death Her, I goe my Liedge resolude to your hie will. Exit Ed. Sound Drum I say, set forward with our power, And France ere long expect a dreadfull hower, I will not take the English standard downe, Till thou empale my Temples with thy Crowne. Enter Lewes the French king, Burbon, and S. Pier, with the Heraulde of England. K. Lewes. Herauld of England, we are pleased to heare, What message thou hast brought vs from thy king, Prepare thy self, and be aduisde in speech. English. Heraulde Right gratious and most christian king of France, I come not to thy presence vnpreparde To doe the message of my Royall Liedge. Edward the Fourth, of England and of France, The lawfull king, and Lord of Ireland, Whose puissant magnanimious breast incensde, Through manifest notorious iniuries, Offred by thee king Lewes and thy French, Against his title to the Crowne of France, And right in all these Dukedomes following, Aquitane, Aniow, Guyen, Anguilesme, Breathes foorth by me the Organe of his speach, Hostile defiance to thy realme and thee: And trampling now vpon the face of France, With barbed horse, and valiant armed foote: Himselfe the Leader of those martiall troupes, Bids thee to battell, where and when thou darst, Except thou make such restitution And yearely tribute on good hostages, As may content his iust conceiued wrath, And to this message answere I expect. Lew. Right peremptorie is this embassage, And were my royall Brother of England pleasde, To entertaine those kind affections, Wherwith we do embrace his amitie: Needles were all these thunder-threatning words, Let heauen (where all our thoughts are registred) Beare record, with what deepe desire of peace, We shall subscribe to such conditions, As equity for England shall propound, If Edward haue sustained wrong in France, Lewes was neuer author of that wrong, Yet faultles we wil make due recompence, We are assurde that his maiestike thoughtes In his mild spirite did neuer meane these warres, Till Charles Burgundie once our fawning frend, But now our open foe, and Count S. Paule, Our Subiect once and Constable of France, But now a traitor to our Realme and vs, Were Motiues to incite him vnto Armes, Which hauing done will leaue him on my life. Herr. The king my maister reckes not Burgundy And scornes S. Paule that trecherous Constable, His puissance is sufficient in it selfe, To conquere France like his Progenitors. K. L. He shall not need to waste by force of war, Where peace shal yeeld him more then he can win We couet peace, and we will purchase it At any rate that reason can demaunde, And it is better England ioyne in league, With vs his strong, old, open enemie, Then with those weake &amp; new dissembling frends, We doe secure vs from our open foes, But trust in frendes (though faithles) we repose, My Lord S. Piere and Cosin Burbon speake What censure you of Burgundy, and S. Paul. S. Pi. Dread L. it is well known that Burgundy, Made shew of tender seruice to your Maiesty, Till by the engine of his flatteries, He made a breach into your Highnes loue, Where entred once and thereof full possest, He so abusde that royall excellence, By getting fooitng into many townes. Castles and fortes belonging to your Crowne That now he holds them gainst your Realm &amp; you B. And Count S. Paule the Constable of France Ambitious in that high authority, Usurpes the lands and Signiories of those, That are true Subiectes, noble Peeres of France, Your boundles fauours did him first suborne, And now to be your Liegeman hee thinkes scorne. Lew. By this coniecture, the vnsteady course, Thy royal maister vndertakes in France, And Herald intimate what feruent zeale, we haue to league with Edward and his English, Three hundred Crownes we giue thee for reward, And of rich Crimson veluet thirty yeardes, In hope thou wilt vnto thy Soueraigne tell, We shew thee not one discontented looke, Nor render him one misbeholden word: But his defiance and his dare to warre, We swallow with the supple oyle of peace, Which gentle Herrald if thou canst procure A thousand Crownes shall iustly guerdon thee. Her. So please it your most sacred Maiesty, To send vnto my gratious Soueraigne, Equall conditions for the bonds of peace, And restitution of his iniuries, His temper is not of obdurate malice, But sweete relenting princely Clemency. Performe your promise of a thousand crownes, And second me with some fitte messenger, And I will vndertake to worke your peace. Le. By the true honor of a Christian king, Effect our Peace and thou shalt haue our Crowns And we wil poste a Herald after thee, That shall confirme thy speech, and our designes, Go Mugeroune, see to this Herauld giuen The veluet, and three hundred crownes proposde, Farewell good friend, remember our request, And kindly recommend vs to king Edward. Exeunt English herauld and Mugeroune. How thinke you Lords ist not more requisite To make our peace, then war with Englands powre. Burb. Yes gracious Lord, the wounds are bleeding yet That Talbot, Bedford, and King Henry made, Which peace must cure, or France shall languish still. S. Piere. Besides my liege by these intestine foes, The Constable and trecherous Burgundie. The States in danger if the English stirre. Enter Mugeroune. K. Lew. Tis perillous, and full of doubt my Lords, We must haue peace with England euerie way, Who shall be Herald in these high affaires. Bur. No better man then Mounsieur Mugeroune. Whose wit is sharpe, whose Eloquence is sound, His presence gracious, and his courage good, A gentleman, a scholler, and a Souldiour, A compleate man for such an Embassage, Art thou content to bee employde Mugeroune, In this Negociacion to King Edward? Mug. If your most sacred Maiestie commaund, Your humble vassall Mu eroune shall go. K. Lew. Gramercies Mugeroune, but thou must assume, A Heraulds habit, and his office both, To pleade our loue, and to procure vs peace, With English Edward, for the good of France. Muge. If now the matter and the forme my Lord, Giue me my Heraulds coate, and I am gone. K. Lew. Thou art a man composde for businesse, Attend on vs for thy instructions. And other fit supplies for these affayres, And for thy dilligence expect reward. Exeunt. Enter seuerall waies Burgundie and the Constable of Fraunce. Con. Whether away so fast goes Burgundie? Bur. Nay rather whether goes the Constable? Con. Why to King Edward (man) is he not come? Meanst thou not likewise to go visit him? Bur. Oh excellent, I know that in thy soule, Thou knowst that I do purpose nothing lesse, Nay I do know, for all thy outward shewe, Thou hast no meaning once to looke on him. Brother dissembler, leaue this colouring, With him that meanes as falsely as thy selfe. Co. I, but thou knowst that Edward on our letters, And hoping our assistance when hee came, Did make this purposde voyage into Fraunce, And with his forces is hee here arriude, Trusting that wee will keepe our word with him. Now, though we meane it not yet set a face, Upon the matter, as though wee intended, To keepe our word with him effectuallie. Bur. And for my better countenance in this case, My lingring siege at Nuse will serue the turne, There will I spend the time to disappoynt, King Edwards hope of my conioyning with him. Con. And I will keepe me still here in S. Quintins, Pretending mightie matters for his aide, But not performing any on my woord, The rather Burgundie, because I aime, [aside ...] At matters which perhaps may cost your head, If all hit right to expectation, In the meane space like a good craftie knaue, That hugs the man, he wisheth hangde in hart [... aside] Keepe I faire weather still with Burgundie, Till matters fall out for my purpose fit. Ici sont mon secrets, beau temps pour moy. Bur. Ici sont mon secrets, beau temps pour moy. Are ye so craftie Constable? proceede, proceede, You quicke sharpe sighted man, imagine me, Blinde, witlesse, and a sillie Idiot, That pries not into all your pollicies, Who I? no, God doth knowe my simple witte. Can neuer sound a iudgement of such reach, As is our cunning Constable of France: Perswade thy selfe so still, and when time serues, And that thou art in most extremitie, Needing my helpe, then take thou heede of mee, In meane while Sir, you are the onely man That hath my heart, hath? I, and great reason too, Thus it befits men of deepe reach to doo. Well Constable, youle backe againe to Nuse, And not aide English Edward? Con. What else man? And keepe thee in Saint Quintins, so shall we Smile at king Edwards weake capacitie. Exeunt. Enter King Edward, with Burgundie, Howard, Sellenger, and Scales. Kin. Ed. Tell not me Burgundie, tis I am wrongd, And you haue dealt like a disloyall knight, B. Edward of England, these are vnkingly words, Kin. He that wil do (my Lord) what he should not. Must and shall heare of me what hee would not, I say againe, you haue deluded mee. Bur. Am I not come according to my woord, K. No Charles of Burgundie, thy word was giuen, To meete with me in Aprill, now tis August, The place appoynted Calice, not Lorraine, And thy approach, to be with martiall troupes, But thou art come, not hauing in thy traine, So much as Page or Lackie to attend thee, As who should say thy presence were munition, And strength inough to answere our expect: Summer is almost spent, yet nothing done, And all by dalliance with vncertaine hope. B. My forces lay before the Cittie Nuse, From which I could not rise, but with dishonour, Unlesse vpon some composition had. King. Ed. There was no such exception in your letters Why smiles Lord Scales? Scales. My man reports my Lord, The composition that the Duke there made, Was meere compulsion: for the Cittizens, Draue him from thence perforce, King Ed. I thought so much: We should not yet haue seene your excellence, But that your heeles were better then your hands B. Lord Scales, thou dost me wrong to slander me. K. E. Letting that passe, it shall be seene my Lord, That we are able of our selfe to claime Our right in France, without or your assistance, Or any others, but the helpe of heauen. Bur. I make no question of it, yet the Constable Prest with no such occasion as I was, Might haue excusde vs both if hee had pleasde. Ki. Ed. Accuse him not, your cities as we came, Were euen as much to bee condemnd as his, They gaue vs leaue to lye within the field, And scarcely would afford vs meate for money. This was small friendship in respect of that, You had ingagde your honour to performe, But march we forward as wee were determined: This is S. Quintins, where you say my Lorde, The Constable is readie to receiue vs, Bu. So much he signified to me by letter, K. Ed. Well wee shall see his entertainment, forward, As they march vpon the Stage, the Lord Scales is strucke downe, and two souldiours slaine outright, with great shot from the towne. Flie to our maine battaile, bid them stand, Theres treason plotted: speake to me L. Scales, Or if there be no powre of life remaining, To vtter thy hearts grieuaunce, make a signe, Two of our common souldiours slaine beside, This is hard welcome, but it was not you, At whom the fatal enginer did ayme, My breast the leuell was, though you the marke, In which conspiracie answere me Duke, Is not thy soule as guiltie as the Earles? Bur. Perish my soule, King Edward if I knew, Of any such intention, yet I did, and grieue that it hath sped no otherwise. King. Ed. Howard and Sellenger? Burgundie steales away. What is there hope of life in none of them? How. The souldiours are both slaine outright my Lord, But the Lord Scales a little is recouered K. Ed. Conuay his bodie to our pauillion, And let our surgeons vse all diligence They can deuise for safegard of his life, Whilst wee with all extremitie of warre, Go plague S. Quintins, Howard fetch on our powers, We will not stirre a foote, till we haue shewne, Iust vengeance on the Constable of France, Oh God, to wooe vs first to passe the sea, And at our comming thus to halt with vs, I thinke the like thereof was neuer seene, But wheres the Duke? Sel. Gone as it seemes my Lord. Stept secretly away, as one that knewe His conscience would accuse him if he staide, K. E. A paire of most dissembling hypocrites, Is he and this base Earle, on whom I vow, Leauing King Lewis vnpreiudicde in peace, To spend the whole measure of my kindled rage, Their streetes shall sweate with their effused bloud, And this bright Sunne be darkned with the smoke, Of smouldring cinders, when their Cittie lies Buried in ashes of reuengefull fire, On whose pale superficies in the steede Of parchment, with my launce ile draw these lines, Edward of England left this memorie, In iust reuenge of hatefull trecherie. Enter Howard againe. Lord Howard haue ye done as I cammanded? How. Our battailes are disposde, and on the browe Of euerie inferiour seruiter my Lord, You might beholde destruction figured, Greedily thrusting to beginne the fight, But when no longer they might be restrainde, And that the drumme and trumpet both beganne To sound warres cheerefull harmonie: behold, A flagge of truce vpon the walles was hangd, And forth the gates did issue meekely pac't, Three men, whereof the Constable is one, The other two the Gunner and his mate, By whose grosse ouer-sight (as they report,) This sodaine chance vnwittingly befel, K. Ed. Bring forth the Constable: the other two, See them safe guarded, till you know our pleasure, Enter the Constable and Howard. Now my Lord Howard, how ist with Scales? How. Wel my dread soueraigne, now his wound is drest, And by the opinion of the surgeons, Its thought he shall not perish by this hurt, K. Ed. I am the gladder, but vnfaithful Earle, I do not see how yet I can dispense With thy submission, this was not the welcome, Your letters sent to England, promisde mee. Con. Right high and mightie Prince condemne me not, That am as innocent in this offence, As any souldiour in the English armie, The fault was in our gunners ignorance, Who taking you for Lewes King of France, That likewise is within the Citties kenne, Made that vnluckie shotte to beate him backe, And not of malice to your maiestie, To knowledge which, I brought them with my selfe, And thirtie thousand crownes within this purse, Sent by the Burgers to redeeme your lacke. K. Ed. Constable of France we wil not sel a drop Of English bloud, for all the gold in France: But in so much two of our men are slaine, To quit their deaths, those two that came with thee, Shall both be cramde into a Cannons mouth, And so be shot into the towne againe: It is not like but that they knew our cullours, And of set purpose did this villanie, Nor can I be perswaded thorowly, But that our person was the mark they aimed at: Yet are wee well content to hold you excusde, Marie our souldiours must bee satisfied, And therefore first shall be distributed, These crownes amongst them, then you shall returne, And of your best prouision send to vs: Thirtie waine loade, beside twelue tunne of wine: This if the Burgers will subscribe vnto, Their peace is made, otherwise I will proclaime, Free libertie for all to take the spoyle. Con. Your highnes shall be answerd presentlie, And I will see these articles performed, K. E. Yet one thing more, I wil that you my Lord, Together with the Duke of Burgundie, Do ere to morrow noone bring all your force, And ioyne with ours, or else we doe recant, And these conditions shall be frustrate, C. Mine are at hand my Lord, and I will write, The Duke may likewise be in readinesse, K. E. Let him haue safe conduct through our armie, And gainst the morning euerie leader see, His troupes be furnisht, for no longer time, God willing shall the tryall be deferred, Twixt Lewes and vs. What echoing sound is this? Sel. A Gentleman from the King of France my Lord, Craues parlance with your excellence, Ki. Ed. A gentleman, bring him in. What newes a Gods name from our brother Lewis. Enter Mugeroune. Mu. Most puissant and most honourable king, My royall maister, Lewis the king of Fraunce, Doth greet your highnes with vnfained loue, Wishing your health, prosperitie, and rule, And thus he saies by me. When was it seene, That euer Lewis pretended hurt to England, Either by close conspirators sent ouer, To vndermine your state, or openlie, By taking armes, with purpose to inuade, Nay when was it, that Lewis was euer heard, So much as to detract from Edwards name, But still hath doone him all his due of speech, By blazing to the world his high deserts, Of wisedome, valour, and his heroyicke birth: Whence is it then that Edward is incensde, To render hate for loue, for amitie sterne war? Not of himselfe wee know: but by the meanes Of some infectious counsell, that like mudde, Would soyle the pure temper of his noble mind, It is the Duke, and that pernicious rebell, Earle of S. Paul, haue set abroach these warres, Who of themselues, vnable to proceede, Would make your grace the instrument of wrong, And when you haue done what you can for them, You shall be sure of nothing but of this, Still to be doubled and dissembled with, But if it might seeme gratious in your eye, To cast of these despisde confederates, Unfit companions for so great a prince, And ioyn in league with Lewes my royal maister, Him shall you finde as willing as of power, To doe your Grace all offices of loue: And what commoditie may spring thereby, To both the Realms, your Grace is wise inough, Without my rude suggestions to imagine, Besides, much bloudshed for this present time, Will be preuented when two such personages, Shal meete together to shake hands in peace, And not with shocke of Launce and Curtelaxe, That Lewes is willing, I am his substitute, And he himselfe in person if you please, Not farre from hence will signifie as much. K. E. Sir, withdraw and giue vs leaue a while. To take aduisement of our Councellors, What say ye Lordes vnto this proffered truce? Ho. In my conceite let not be slipt my Lord. Sel. Wilt not be dishonor hauing landed So great an army in these partes of France, And not to fight before we doe returne? Ho. How can it when the enemie submittes, And of himselfe makes tender of allegiance? Sel. I thats the question whether he will yeeld, And doe king Edward fealtie or no. Ed. What talk ye Lords? he shal subscribe to that, Or no conditions ile accept at all. Ho. Let him be bound my Lord to pay your Grace, Toward your expences, since your comming ouer Seauenty fiue thousand Crownes of the Sunne, And yearely after fiftie thousand more, During your life, with homage therewithall That he doth hold his royaltie from you, And take his offer, twill not be amisse. Ed. It shall be so, draw you the articles, And Sellinger call forth the Messenger, Bring with thee too a cup of Massie gold, And bid the bearer of our priuie purse, Inclose therein a hundred English Ryals, Friend we do aceept thy maisters League, With no lesse firme affection then he craues, If he will meete vs here betwixt our tents, It shall on both sides be confirmde by oath, On this condition that he will subscribe, To certaine Articles shall be proposde, And so thou hast thy answere, to requite Thy paines herein, we giue to thee this cup. Her. Health &amp; encrease of honor wait on Edward. Ed. Lord Howard bring ye Frenchm? on his way. Ed. King Lewes is one that neuer was precise, But now L. Howard and Tom Sellinger, There is a taske remaines for you to doe, And that is this, you two shall be disguisde, And one of you repaire to Burgondy, The other to the Constable of France, Where you shall learne in secret if you can, If they entend to meete vs here to morrow, Or how they take this our accord with France, Somewhat it giues me you wil bring from thence Worthy the noting, will you vndertake it? Sel. With all my hart my L. I am for Burgondy How. And I am for the Constable of France. Exeunt. Ed. Make speede againe, what newes? Mess. The king of France my L. attended royally, Is marching hetherward to meete your Grace, Ed. He shall be welcome, hast thou drawn the articles? Mess. Yes my dread Soueraigne. Ed. Goe, call foorth our traine, We may receiue him with like Maiestie. Enter certaine Noblemen and Soldiers with a Drum, they march about the Stage, then enter king Lewes, and his traine, and meete with k. Edward, the kinges embrace. K. Lewes. My princely brother, we are grieued much, To thinke you haue beene at so great a charge, And toyld your royall selfe so farre from home, Upon the vnconstant promise of those men, That both dissemble with your Grace and me. K. Edw. Brother of France you might condemne vs rightly, Not onely of great wrong and toyle sustaind, But of exceeding folly, if incited, We had presumde to enter these Dominions, Upon no other reason then the word, And weake assistance of the Earle S. Paule, Or Burgondies perswasion: tis our right, That winges the body of composed warre, And though we listned to their flatteries, Yet so we shapte the course of our affaires, As of our selfe we might be able found, Without the trusting to a broken staffe, Lew. I know your Maiesty had more discretion But this is not the occasion of our meeting, If you be pleasd to entertaine a peace, My kingly Brother in the sight of these, And of the all discouering eye of heauen, Let vs embrace, for as my life I sweare, I tender England and your happines. K. Ed. The like do I by you &amp; warlicke France But princely Brother ere this knot be knit, There are some few conditions to be signde, That done I am as ready as your selfe. K. Lew. Faire brother let vs heare them what they be. King Ed. Herald repeate the Articles. Her. First it is couenanted that Lewes king of France, according to the custome of his predicessors shall doe homage to king Edward, king of England, as his Soueraigne and true heire to all the Dominions of France. Bur. How as his Soueraigne? that were to depose And quite bereaue him of his Diademe, UUill kingly Lewes stoope to such vassalage? Ki. Edwar. Burbon and if he will not let him chose. K. Le. Brother haue patience, Burbon seale your lips, And interrupt not these high consequentes. Forward Herrauld, what is else demanded? Her. Secondly it is couenanted that Lewes K. of France, shall pay vnto Edward king of England immediately vpon the agreement betwixt their Maiesties, seauentie fiue thousand Crownes of the sunne, toward the charge K. Edward hath beene at since his ariuall in these partes of France. Bur. Mort dieu, heele neither leaue him Crowne nor coyne. K. Lewes. Burbon I say be silent, Herrauld reade on. Herald. Thirdly and lastly, it is couenanted, that ouer and beside those seauentie fiue thousand crownes of the sunne, now presentlie to be paide, Lewes king of France shall yearly hereafter, during the life of Edward king of England, pay fifty thousand crownes more without fraude or guile, to be tendred at his Maiesties Castle, commonly called the Tower of London. Bur. Nay bind him that hee bring his Lordship a couple of capons too euery yeare beside. Here is a peace indeed farre worse then warre. K. Ed Brother of France are you resolude to doe, According as you heare the Couenantes drawne. K. Lew. Brother of England, mount your royall throane, For Subiectes weale, and glory of my God, And to deale iustly with the world beside, Knowing your title to be lineall. From the great Edward of that name the third, Your Predicessor, thus I do resigne, Giuing my Crowne and scepter to your hand, As an obedient Liegeman to your Grace. K. E. The same doe I deliuer backe againe, With as large interest as you had before. Now for the other couenantes. K. Lewes. Those my Lord, Shall likewise be performde with expedition, And euer after, as you haue prescribde, The yearely pension shalbe truely paide. Herr. Sweare on this booke king Lewes so help you God, You meane no otherwise then you haue saide. K. Lew. So helpe me God as I dissemble not. K. Ed. And so helpe he me as I entend to keepe, Unfained league and truce with noble France: And kingly Brother now to consumate, This happie day feast in our royall tent, English and French are one, so it is meant. Exeunt. Enter at one dore, Burgundie chafing, with him Sellinger disguised like a Soldier, at an other the Constable of France, with him Howard in the like disguise. Bur. A peace concluded, saiest thou? ist not so? Sel. My Lord I doe assure you it is so. Con. And thou affirmst the like? say, dost thou not? How. I doe my Lord, and that for certainty. Bur. I haue found it now, the villaine Constable Hath secretly with Edward thus compact, To ioyne our king and him in amitie, And thereby doubtlesse got into his hands, Such lands and Dukedomes as I aymed at, [aside ...] And leaues me disappointed in my hope, A plague vpon such craftie cosening, Now shall I be a marke for them to aime at, [... aside] And that vile slaue to triumph in my foile. Con. Tis so, for it can be no otherwise, Burgundie hath beene priuie to this plot, Conspirde with Lewes and the English king, To saue his owne stake, and assure him selfe, Of all those Signeuries I hoped for, And thereupon this close peace is contriu'de, Now must the Constable be as a butte, For all their bullets to be leueld at, Hell and hot vengeance light on Burgundie, For this his subtile secret villanie. Bur. Well fellow for thy paines take that, Leaue me alone, for I am much displeasde. to Sel. Con. And get thee gone my friend, theres for thy paines, So leaue me to my selfe, to Howard. Sel. Fare ye well Sir, I hope I haue pepperd yee. How. And so I thinke haue I my Constable. Exeunt Sellin. and How. Bur. Now Constable, this peace, this peace, What thinke yee of it man? Con. Nay rather what thinkes Burgundie? Bur. I thinke that he that did contriue the same, Was little lesse then a dissembling villaine. Con. Dog bite thy selfe? come on, come on, Haue not you plaide Iohn for the king, To saue your selfe Sir? Bur. I, art thou good at that? Adiew Sir, I may chance to hit you pat. Exit. Con. You may Sir? I perhappes may be before ye, And for this cunning through the nose to bore ye. Exeunt. Enter King Edward, king Lewes, How. Sellinger, and their traine. K. Ed. So Sellinger, we then perceyue by thee The Duke is passing angrie at our league? Sel. I, my dread Lord beyond comparison, Like a mad dog snatching at euery one That passeth by: shall I but shew you how, And act the manner of his tragicke furie? K. No stay a while, me thought I heard thee say, They meant to greet vs by their messengers. Sel. They did my Lord. K. Ed. What and the Constable too? How. My soueraigne yes. King. But how tooke he the newes? How. Faith euen as discontented as might be, But being a more deepe melancholiste, And sullenner of temper then the Duke, He chawes his mallice, fumes &amp; frothes at mouth, Uttering but little more then what we gather By his disturbed lookes and riueld front, Sauing that now and then his boyling passion, Damnd vp as in a furnace, finding vent Breakes through his seuerd lips into short puffes, And then he mumbles forth a word or two, As doth a toothlesse Monke when hees at mattens. Kin. Oh it was sport alone to note their cariage. Se. Sport my Lord? wil you but heare me speake, And if I do not wearie you with laughter, Nere trust Tom Sellinger more vpon his word. Sound a Trumpet. King. I pray thee peace, by this it should appeare One of their messengers is come, go see, Upon my life we shall haue some deuise, Of new dissimulation: how now Tom? Sel. Tis as your highnesse did suppose my Lord, Here is a messenger from Burgondie. King. Excellent good, admit him presently, And brother of France, let me intreate your grace To stand aside a little in my tent, Least finding vs together, he refraine, To tell the message he is sent about, So sure I am perswaded we shall find Some notable peece of knauerie set a foote. K. Lew. With all my hart, vrge him speake loud enough, That I my Lord may vnderstand him too. exit. Enter the Lord of Conte. K. Ed. Feare not, I haue the method in my mind: What is it you my Lord of Conte? welcome, How doth the valiant Duke, in health I hope? Co. In health (my Lord) of body, though in mind Somwhat distemperd, that your Grace hath ioind In league with his professed enemie. K. Ed. How say you that my Lord? pray you speake out, For I of late by reason of a cold, Am somewhat thicke of hearing. Con. Thus my Lord, Your Grace demanded if the Duke were well, I answere you, he is in health of bodie, Though inwardly in mind somewhat perplext, That you without his knowledge haue tane truce With childish Lewes that hartles king of France. K. E. With whom I pray ye? a little lowder Sir. C. With childish Lewes that hartles K. of France. K. Ed. I now do vnderstand you, is it that He takes vnkindly? why if he had come With his expected forces as he promist, I had beene still vncapable of peace, But he deceiuing me, the fault was his. Con. No my good Lord, the fault was not in him, But in that lewd pernicious counterfaite, That craftie Foxe the Constable of France, Who counceld him to keepe him at his siege, Saying it would be more dishonorable To rise from thence, then any way profitable, To meete your Maiestie, beside my Lord, It hath bin proued since, how much the Constable, Hates your proceedings, by that wilfull shotte, Was made against you from S. Quintins wals, Which though he seemd to colour with faire speech, The truth is, they did leuell at your selfe, And grieued when they heard you were not slaine. Ki. E. May I be bold to credit your report? Cont. The Duke vpon his honour bad me say, That it was true, and therewithall quoth he, Tell noble Edward if he will recant, And fall from Lewis againe, knowing it is, More for his dignitie to be sole king, And conquer France as did his auncestors, Then take a Fee, and so be satisfied, That I am readie with twelue thousand souldiers All well appoynted, and not onely will, Deliuer him the Constable of France, That hee may punish him as he sees good, But seate him in the throwne imperiall, Which now another basely doth vsurpe, K. Ed. Speak that againe, I heard not your last words, Cont. But seate you in the throne imperiall, Which now another basely doth vsurpe. Ki. I thanke his honour for his good regard, Pleaseth you stay till wee haue pausde vpon it, And you shall haue our answere to the Duke, Tom Sellinger receiue him to your tent, And let him taste a cuppe of Orleance wine, Now my Kingly brother, haue you heard this newes? K. Lew. So plainly my Lord that I scarce held my selfe, From stepping forth, hearing my royall name, So much prophande and slubberd as it was, But I do weigh the person like himselfe From whence it came, a slie dissembler, And spight my anger I was forst sometime, To smile to thinke the Duke doth hang his friend, Behinde his backe, whome to his face he smothes. K. E. But we shall haue farre better sport anone: Howard tels me that another Messenger, Is come in Post-hast from the Constable, As you haue begunne with patience heare the rest. K. Le. No more adoe, ile to my place againe, Remember that you still be deafe my Lorde, K. E. I warrant you, Howard, cal in the messenger, Enter the messenger from the Constable. Mes. Health to the victorious King of England. Ki. E. Tell him he must straine out his voyce alowd, For I am somewhat deafe, and cannot heare. How. His maiestie requests you to speake out, Because his hearing is of late decayde. Mes. The worthie Earle S. Paul. King Ed. Come neere mee. Mes. The worthie Earle S. Paul greetes noble Edward, And giues your grace to vnderstand by me, That whereas Charles that painted sepulchre, And most disloyall Duke of Burgundie, Hath but vsurpt the habit of a friend, Being in heart your deadly enemie, As wel appeares in his false breach of promise, And that whereas he neuer meant himselfe, To send you aide, but likewise was the meanes, To hinder my Lords well affected dutie, Alleadging you desirde his companie But that you might betray him to his king, Beside whereas it wil be proude my Lord, That he did hire the Gunner of S. Quintins, For a large summe of money, to discharge Three seuerall peeces of great Ordenance, Upon your comming to that cursed towne, To slay your Maiestie: in which regard If it will please ye to reuoke from France, And thinke of Burgundie as hee deserues, The Duke with expedition bad me say, That he would put the Earle into your hands, Whereby you might reuenge his trecherous purpose, And ayde you too with twise fiue thousand men, And seate you like a conquerour in France, K. Ed. Can it seeme possible that two such friends, So firmely knitte together as they were, Should on a sodaine now be such great foes? M. The Earle my Lord could neuer abide the Duke Since his last treason against your sacred person, Before Saint Quintins came to open light. Ki. Was that the cause of their dissention then? Mes. It was my Lord. King Ed. Well I will thinke vppont And you shall haue our answere by and by, Cosin Howard take him aside, But let him bee kept from the others sight. Ho. Sir wil you walk in, my Lord wil take aduise, And so dispatch you backe againe vnto the Earle, K. L. Heres vyinge of villanie who shal haue al, Fraude with deceite, deceit with fraude outfacde, I would the deuil were there to crie swoope-stake, But how intendes your Grace to deale with them? King E. Faith in their kind, I am the steele you see, Against the which their enuie being strooke, The Sparkles of hypocrisie flie forth, Twere not amisse to quench them in their bloud. Enter another messenger to the King of Fraunce with letters. Mes. My Lord heres letters to your Maiestie, One from the Duke of Burgundie, the other from the Constable, K. L. More villanie, a thousand crownes to nothing: K. E. Can there be more then is alreadie broacht, Me thinks they haue alreadie done so well, As this may serue to bring them both to hel. K. Le. No, no, they are indifferently well loden, But yet their fraughts, not full, see other ware, Other prouision to prepare their waie, The verie same (My Lord) which they pretend, In loue to you against my life and crowne, The same they vndertake to doe for me Against your safetie, vrging if I please, That they will ioyne their forces both with mine, And in your backe returne to Calice, cut the throuts Of you and all your souldiours. K. E. Oh damnable. But that I see it figurde in these lines, I would haue sworne there had bin nothing lefte, For their pernitions brain to worke vpon. K. L. A traitor is like, a boldfacde hypocrite, That neuer will be brought vnto a nonplus, So long as hee hath libertie to speake. K. E. The way to cure them, is to cut them off, Call forth their messengers once more to vs, How. Both of them my Lord? K. E. Yes, both togither. Weele see if they haue grace to blush or no, At that their maisters shame now to attempt. Enter both the Messengers. Cont. What is his Maiestie of France so neere? And Mounsier Rosse the Earles secretarie? I feare some hurt depends vpon his presence, M. How comes it that I see the french king here? I and the Lord of Countie too me thinks, Pray God our message be not made a scorne. K. Ed. You told me that you came from Earle S. Paul. Mes. I did my Lord, And therein fabled not. K. E, You told me too of many kinde indeuours, Which hee intended for our benefite? Mes. No more then hee is willing to performe. Ki. E. Know you his hand-writing if you seete? Mes. I doe my Lorde. King Ed. Is this his hand or no? Mes. I cannot say but that it is his hand. K. E. How comes it then that vnderneath his hand My death is sought, when you that are his mouth, Tune to our eares a quite contrarie tale? The like read you decyphred in this paper, Concerning trecherous wauering Burgundie, Unlesse you graunt they can diuide themselues, And of two shapes become foure substances, How is it I should haue their knightly aide, And yet by them be vtterly destroyde? K. Le. And I to be protected by their meanes, And yet they shall conspire against my life. K. E. What call you this, but vile hypocrisie? K. L. Nay pesant-like vnheard of trecherie. Co. My Lord vpbrayd not me with this offence: I do protest I knewe of no such letters, Nor any other intention of the Duke, More then before was vttred in my message. Sel. Will you bee halting too before a creeple? Do you not remember what they were, That first did certifie the Duke of truce, Betwixt the renowned Edward and the French? Co. Yes they were two souldiours, what of that? Sel. Those souldiers were this gentleman and I, Where we did heare the foule mouthde Duke exclaime, Against our noble soueraigne and this Prince, And rorde and bellowed like a parish bull, And that in hearing both of you and him, His words so please my Lord I can repeate, As he did speake them at that very time. K. Ed. Well they are messengers, &amp; for that cause We are content to beare with their amisse, But keepe them safe, and let them not returne, To carrie tales vnto those counterfeits, Untill you haue them both as fast insnarde, To compasse which the better, brother of Fraunce, Fiue thousand of our souldiours here we leaue, To be imployde in seruice to that end, The rest with vs to England shall returne, Exit. Enter Chorus. Ch. King Edward is returned home to England, And Lewes King of France soone afterward, Surprized both his subtill enemies, Rewarding them with traiterous recompence, Now do we draw the curtaine of our Scene, To speake of Shoare and his faire wife againe, With other matters thereupon depending, You must imagine since you sawe him last Preparde for trauile, he hath bin abroade, And seene the sundrie fashions of the world, Vlysses like, his countries loue at length, Hoping his wifes death, and to see his friendes, Such as did sorrow for his great mishaps, Come home is hee, but so vnluckilie, As hee is like to loose his life thereby: His and her fortunes shall wee now pursue, Gracde with your gentle sufferance and view. Exeunt. Enter Mistris Shoare with Iockie her man, and some attendants more, and is met by Sir Robert Brakenburie. Iane Shore. Haue yee bestowde our small beneuolence, On the poore prisoners in the Common Gaole, Of the White Lyon and the Kings bench? Iockie. Yes for suth? Iane. What prisons this? Iockie. The Marshalsea forsuth. Enter Sir Robert Brakenburie. Bra. Well met faire Ladie in the happiest time, And choysest place that my desire could wish, Without offence, where haue yee beene this way? Ia. To take the aire here in Saint Georges field, Sir Robert Brakenburie, and to visit some Poore patients that cannot visit mee. Bra. Are you a phisition? Iane. I a simple one. Bra. What disease cure yee? Iane. Faith none perfectlie, My phisicke doth but mittigate the paine A little while, and then it comes againe. Bra. Sweete mistris Shoare, I vnderstand ye not. Iane.

Iane. Peace good Sir Robert, tis not worthie praise, Nor yet worth thankes, that is of duetie doone, For you know well, the world doth know too well, That all the coales of my poore charitie, Cannot consume the scandall of my name, What remedie? well, tell mee gentle knight, What meant your kinde salute and gentle speech, At our first meeting, when you seemde to blesse The time and place of our encounter heere? Bra. Ladie there lies here prisonde in the Marshalsea, A gentleman of good parents and good discent. My deare neere kinsman, Captaine Harrie Stranguidge, As tall a skilfull Nauigator tride, As ere sette foote in any shippe at sea, Whose lucke it was to take a prize of France, As hee from Rochell was for London bound: For which (except his pardon be obtainde, By some especiall fauourite of the King) Hee and his crew, a companie of proper men, Are sure to die, because twas since the League.

Ile rack my credit, and wil launch my crowns, To saue their liues, if they haue done no murther. Sh. [aside.] O thou hast crackt thy credit with a crowne. And murdred me poore Mathew Shore aliue.

Iane. Well Captain Stranguidge, were the king at home, I could say more. Stran. Ladie, hees come a shore. Last night at Douer, my boy came from thence, And saw his Highnesse land. Ian. Then courage sirs Ile vse my fayrest meanes to saue your liues, In the meane season spend that for my sake. casts her purse. Enter Lord Marquesse Dorset, and claps her on the shoulder. Mar. By your leaue Mistresse Shore, I haue taken paines, To find you out, come you must go with me. Iane. Whither my Lord? Mar. Unto the Queene my mother. Iane. Good my Lord Marquesse Dorset wrong me not. Mar. I can not wrong thee as thou wrongst my mother, Ile bring thee to her let her vse her pleasure. Iane. Against my will I wrong her good my Lord, Yet am ashamde to see her Maiestie. Sweet Lord excuse me, say ye saw me not. Mar. Shall I delude my mother for a whore? No Mistresse Shore ye must go to the Queene. Ia. Must I my Lord? what will she do to me? Use violence on me now the kings away? Alas my Lord, behold this showre of teares, Which kind King Edward would compassionate, Bring me not to her, she will slit my nose, Or marke my face, or spurne me vnto death. Looke on me Lord, can ye find in your hart? To haue me spoild that neuer thought you harme? O rather with your rapier runne me through, Then carrie me to the displeased Queene. Shore. O hadst thou neuer broke thy vow to me From feare and wrong had I defended thee. Mar. I am inexorable, therefore arise, And go with me, what rascall crue is this, Mistres Shores suters, such slaues make her proud What sir Robert Brakenbury you a Shorist too? Bra. No Shorist, but to saue my cosens life. Mar. Then ile be hangd if he escape for this, The rather for your meanes to Mistresse Shore. My mother can do nothing, this whore all, Come away minion you shall prate no more. Ia. Pray for me friends and I will pray for you, God send you better hap then I expect, Go to my lodging you, and if I perish, Take what is there in lieu of your true seruice. Ioc. Na a maye sale ayse nere forsake my gude maistresse, Till aye hea seene tha worst that spight can du her. Exeunt Marquesse, &amp; Iane &amp; theirs. Sho. For all the wrong that thou hast done to me, They should not hurt thee yet if I were free. Bra. See cosen Stranguidge how the case is chaungde, She that should help thee can not helpe her selfe. Strang. What remedie? the God of heauen helps all, What say ye mates? our hope of life is dasht, Now none but God, lets put our trust in him, And euery man repent him of his sinne, And as together we haue liu'd like men, So like tall men together let vs die: The best is if we die for this offence, Our ignorance shall pleade our innocence. Keeper. Your meat is ready (Captaine) you must in. Stran. Must I? I will: Cosen what will you do? Bra. Uisit you soone, but now I will to Court To see what shal become of Mistres Shore. exit. Stran, God speed ye well. Keep. Come Sir will you go in? Sh. Ile eat no meat, giue me leaue to walk here, Am I now left alone? no millions Of miseries attend me euery where: Ah Mathew Shore, how doth all seeing heauen, Punish some sinne, from thy blind conscience hid? Inflicting paine where all thy pleasure was, And by my wife came all these woes to passe, She falsde her faith, and brake her wedlocks band, Her honor falne, how could my credit stand? Yet wil not I poore Iane on thee exclaime, Though guilty thou, I guiltlesse suffer shame. I left this land too little for my griefe, Returning, am accounted as a theefe, Who in that ship came but as passenger, To see my friends, hoping the death of her, At sight of whom some sparkes of former loue, (Hid in affections ashes) pittie moue, Kindling compassion in my broken hart, That bleedes to thinke on her insuing smart, O see weake womens imperfections, That leaue their husbands safe protections, Hazarding all on strangers flatteries, Whose lust alaid, leaues them to miseries, See what dishonor breach of wedlocke brings, Which is not safe euen in the armes of kings: Thus do I Iane lament thy present state, Wishing my teares thy torments might abate. Exit. Enter the Queene, Marquesse Dorset leading Mistres Shore, who fals down on her knees before the Queen fearefull and weeping. Qu. Now (as I am a Queene) a goodly creature, Sonne how was she attended where you found her? Mar. Madame I found her at the Marshal-sea, Going to visite the poore prisoners, As she came by, hauing beene to take the aire, And there the keeper told me she oft deales Such bounteous almes as seldome hath been seene. Qu. Now before God, she would make a gallant Queene, But good sonne Dorset stand aside a while. God saue your Maiestie my Ladie Shore, My Lady Shore said I? Oh blasphemie, To wrong your title with a Ladies name, Queene Shore, nay rather Empresse Shore, God saue your Grace, your maiestie, your highnes, Lord I want titles, you must pardon me: What? you kneele there, King Edwards bedfellow And I your subiect sit? fie, fie, for shame. Come take your place, and ile kneele where you do, I may take your place, you haue taken mine, Good Lord that you will so debase your selfe: I am sure you are our sister Queene at least, Nay that you are, then let vs sit together. Iane. Great Queene, yet heare me, if my sinne committed, Haue not stopt vp all passage to your mercy, To tell the wrongs that I haue done your highnes, Might make reuenge exceed extremitie, Oh had I words or tongue to vtter it, To pleade my womans weaknesse, &amp; his strength, That was the onely worker of my fall. Euen innocence her selfe would blush for shame, Once to be namde or spoken of in this, Let them expect for mercie whose offence, May but be called sinne, Oh mine is more, Prostrate as earth, before your highnesse feete. Inflict what torments you shall thinke most meet. Ma. Spurne the whore (mother) teare those enticing eyes, That robd you of King Edwards dearest loue. Mangle those locks, the baites to his desires, Let me come to her, you but stand and talke, As if reuenge consisted but in words. Qu. Sonne stand aloofe, and do not trouble me, Alas poore soule, as much adoo haue I, aside. To forbeare teares to keep her company. Yet once more will I to my former humor. Why as I am, thinke that thou wert a Queene, And I as thou should wrong thy princely bed, And winne the King thy husband, as thou mine: UUould it not sting thy soule? Or if that I Being a Queen, while thou didst loue thy husband: Should but haue done as thou hast done to me, UUould it not grieue thee? yes I warrant thee. There's not the meanest woman that doth liue, But if she like and loue her husband well, She had rather feele his warme limmes in her bed, Then see him in the armes of any Queene, You are flesh and bloud as we, and we as you, And all alike in our affections, Though Maiestie makes vs the more ambitious. What tis to fall into so great a hand, Knowledge might teach thee. There was once a king, Henry the second, who did keepe his lemman, Cag'de vp at Woodstocke in a Labyrinth, His Queene yet got a tricke to find her out, And how she vsde her, I am sure thou hast heard, Thou art not mewd vp in some secret place, But kept in Court here vnderneath my nose, Now in the absence of my Lord the king, Haue I not time most fitting for reuenge? Faire Rosamond, she a pure virgin was, Untill the king seduc'de her to his will. She wrongd but one bed, onely the angry Queenes, But thou hast wronged two, mine and thy husbands, Be thine owne Iudge, and now in iustice see, What due reuenge I ought to take on thee. Ia. Euen what you will (great Queene) here do I lie, Humble and prostrate at your Highnesse feet, Inflict on me what may reuenge your wrong, Was neuer lambe abode more patiently, Then I will doe. Call all your griefes to mind, And do euen what you will, or how likes you, I will not stirre, I will not shrike or crie, Be it torture, poyson, any punishment, Was neuer Doue or Turtle more submisse, Then I will be vnto your chastisement. M. Fetcht I her for this? mother let me come to her, And what compassion will not suffer you To do to her, referre the same to me. Qu. Touch her not sonne, vpon thy life I charge thee, But keepe off still, if thou wilt haue my loue. Exit Ma. I am glad to heare ye are so well resolu'de, To beare the burthen of my iust displeasure. She drawes forth a knife, &amp; making as though she meant to spoyle her face, runs to her, and falling on her knees, embraces and kisses her, casting away the knife. Thus then ile do, alas poore soule, Shal I weep with thee? in faith poore hart I will, Be of good comfort, thou shalt haue no harme, But if that kisses haue the power to kill thee, Thus, thus, &amp; thus, a thousand times ile stab thee. Iane I forgiue thee: what fort is so strong, But with besieging he will batter it? Weepe not (sweet Iane) alas I know thy sexe, Toucht with the selfe same weaknes yt thou art, And if my state had beene as meane as thine, And such a beautie to allure his eye, (Though I may promise much to mine owne strength) What might haue hapt to me, I cannot tell. Nay feare not, for I speake it with my hart, And in thy sorrow truely beare a part. Ia. Most high and mighty Queene, may I belieue There can be found such mercy in a woman, And in a Queene, more then that in a wife, So deeply wrongd as I haue wronged you? In this bright christall mirror of your mercy, I see the greatnesse of my sinne the more, And makes my fault more odious in mine eyes, Your princely pittie now doth wound me more, Then all your threatnings euer did before. Qu. Rise my sweet Iane, I say thou shalt not kneele, Oh God forbid, that Edwards Queene should hate Her, whom she knowes he doth so dearely loue, My loue to her, may purchase me his loue. Iane, speake well vnto the King of me and mine, Remember not my sonnes ore-hastie speech, Thou art my sister, and I loue thee so. I know thou mayest do much with my dear Lord, Speake well of vs to him in any case, And I and mine will loue and cherish thee. Ia. All I can do is all too little too, Tut to requite the least part of this grace, Bhe dearest thoughts that harbour in this breast, Shall in your seruice onely be exprest. Enter King Edward angerly, his Lords following, and Sir Robert Brakenbury. King. What is my Iane with her? it is too true, See where she hath her downe vpon her knees. Why how now Besse? what, will ye wrong my Iane? Come hither loue, what hath she done to thee? Iane fals on her knees to the King. Ian. Oh royall Edward, loue, loue, thy beauteous Queene, The onely perfect mirrour of her kind, For all the choysest vertues can be nam'de. Oh let not my bewitching lookes withdraw Your deare affections from your dearer Queene, But to requite the grace that she hath showne To me the worthlesse creature on this earth, To banish me the Court immediately, Great King let me but beg one boone of thee, That Shores wife nere do her more iniurie. As Iane kneels on one side the King, so the Queene steps and kneels on the other. Qu. Nay then ile beg against her royall Edward, Loue thy Iane still, nay more if more may be. kissing her. And this is all the harme that at my hands She shal endure for it. Oh where my Edward loues, It ill beseemes his Queene to grudge thereat. Kin. Sayest thou me so Besse, on my kingly word, Edward will honour thee in hart for this: But trust me Besse? I greatly was affraid, I should not find ye in so good a tune. How now, what would our Constable of the Towre? Bra. The Queene and mistris Shoare do know my sute. Qu. It is for Stranguidge and his men at sea, Edward needes must you pardon them. King. Haue I not vowed the contrarie alreadie? Dishonour mee when I haue made a league? My word is past, and they shall suffer death, Or neuer more let mee see France againe. Ia. Why there is one was but a passenger. Shall hee die too? King. Passe me no passage Iane, were he in companie, hee dies for companie. Queene. Good Iane intreate for them. Iane. Come Edward, I must not take this answere, Needes must I haue some grace for Stranguidge. King. Why Iane, haue I not denide my Queene? Yet what ist Iane I would denie to thee? I prethee Brakenburie be not thou displeasde, My word is past, not one of them shall liue, One go and see them forthwith sent to death. Exeunt Enter Clarence, Glocester, and Shawe. Gloc. I cannot see this prophesie you speake off, Should any way so much displease the King, And yet I promise you good Brother Clarence, Tis such a letter as concernes vs both, That G. should put away King Edwards children, And sit vpon his throne? that G. should? well. Cla. God blesse the King, and those two sweet yong Princes. Glo. Amen good brother Clarence: Shaw. Amen. G. And send them all to heauen shortly I beseech him. C. The kings much troubled in his sicknesse with it. G. I promise you hee is, and verie much. But Doctor Shawe, who prophesied that G. should be so sadly ominous to vs. Shaw. My Lord of Glocester I receiude the same From olde Frier Anselme of Saint Bartholmewes. Glo. A great learned man he was, and as I haue heard, Hath prophesied of very many things, I promise you it troubles mee, I hope in mee his prophesie is true. aside. Cla. An so it does me, I tell you Brother Glocester. G. I am sure it does, for looke you Brother Clarence, We know not how his Highnesse will applie it, We are but two, your selfe my Lord and I, Should the yong Princes faile, which God defend? Clarence. Which God defend. Shawe. Which God defend, Glo. aside. But they should bee cutte off: Amen, Amen. You brother first, and should your issue faile, Poore I am next, the yongest of the three. But how farre I am from a thought of that, Heauen witnes with me, that I wish you dead. aside. Clarence. Brother I durst bee sworne. Gl. God blesse you all, and take you to him if it be his wil. Now brother, this prophesie of G. troubling the King, Hee may as well applie it vnto Glocester, My Dukedomes name, if hee bee Iealious, As vnto George your name, good brother Clarence, God helpe, God helpe: ifaith it troubles me, You would not thinke how: aside. that any of you liue. Cla. It cannot chuse: howe innocent I am, And how vnspotted are my loyall thoughts Unto his Highnes, and those sweet yong Prnices, God bee my record. Glo. Who you, I, I durst answere for you, That I shall cutte you off ere it be long, aside. But reuerend Doctor, you can onely tell, Being his Highnesse confessor, how hee takes it. aside to Shaw. Shaw you know my mind, a villain like my selfe, Shawe. My Lord of Clarence I must tell your Lordship, His Highnesse is much troubled in his sicknesse With this same Prophesie of G. Who is this G? Oft times hee will demaunde, and then will hee sigh, And name his Brother George, your selfe my Lord, And then hee strikes his breast, I promise you, This morning in thextreamest of his fitte, He lay so still, wee all thought hee had slept, When sodainely, George is the G. quoth hee, And gaue a groane, and turnde his face away. Cla. God bee my witnesse, witnes with my soule, My iust and vpright thoughts to him and his, I stand so guiltlesse and so innocent, As I could wish my breast to bee transparent, And my thoughts written in great letters there, The world might reade the secrets of my soule. Gl. Ah Brother Clarence, when you are suspected, Wel, well, it is a wicked world the while, But shall I tell you brother in plaine tearmes, I feare, I feare, your selfe and I haue enemies, About the King, God pardon them, The world was neuer worser to bee trusted: Ah brother George, where is that loue that was, Ah it is banisht brother from the world: Ah Conscience, Conscience, and true brotherhood, Tis gone, tis gone, brother I am your friend, I am your louing Brother, your owne selfe, And loue you as my soule, vse mee in what you please, And you shall see Ile doo a brothers part, Send you to heauen I hope, ere it bee long, aside. I am a true stampte villaine as euer liude. Cla. I know you will, then brother I beseech you, Pleade you mine innocence vnto the King, And in meane time to tel my Loyaltie, Ile keepe within my house at Bainards Castle, Untill I heare how my dread Soueraigne takes it. Glocester. Do so good brother. Cla. Farewell good Brother Glocester. Glo. My teares will scarcely let me take my leaue, I loue you so: Farewell sweete George. (Exit Cla. So, is hee gone? now Shaw tis in thy powre, To binde me to thee euerlastingly, And there is not one steppe that I shall rise, But I will draw thee with me vnto greatnesse, Thou shalt sitte in my bosome as my soule, Incense the King, now being as thou art, So neere about him, and his Confessor, That this G. onely is George Duke of Clarence, Doctor thou needst not my instruction, Thou hast a searching braine, a nimble spirite, Able to master any mans affections, Effect it Shawe, and bring it to passe once, Ile make thee the greatest Shawe that euer was. Glo. My Lord, I am going by commandement, Unto the Marshalsea, to Captaine Stranguidge, For Piracie of late condemnde to die, There to confesse him and his companie, That done, Ile come with speede backe to the king, And make no doubt but ile effect the thing. Glo. Farewell gentle Doctor. Shaw. Farewell my Lord of Glocester. Exit. Glo. Let me awake my sleeping wittes a while, Ha, the marke thou aimst at Richard is a crowne, And many stand betwixt thee and the same, What of all that? Doctor play thou thy part, Ile climbe vp by degrees, through many a heart. Exit. Enter Brakenburie with Vaux the Keeper. Bra. Why master Vaux is there no remedie? But instantly they must be led to death? Can it not be deferd till after noone. Or but two houres, in hope to get repriue? K. Maister Lieutenant, tis in vain to speake, The Kings incensde, and will not pardon them; The men are patient, and resolude to die, The Captaine and that other Gentleman, Haue cast the dice whether shall suffer first. Bra. How fell the Lot, to Stranguidge or to him? Kee. The guiltlesse passenger must first go toot, Bra. They are all guiltlesse from intent of ill, Kee. And yet must die for doing of the deede, Besides the Duke of Exeter found dead, And naked floating vp and downe the sea, Twixt Calice and our coast, is laid to them, That they should robbe, and cast him ouerboord. Bra. My soule bee pawne, they neuer knew of it. Kee. Well bring them foorth. Bra. Stay them yet but an houre. Kee. I dare not doo it Sir Robert Brakenburie. You are Lieutenant of the Towre your selfe, And know the perill of protracting time, Moreouer heres that pickthanke Doctor Shaw, The Duke of Glocesters spaniell shriuing them, Come bring them foorth. Bra. Poore Stranguidge must thou die? Enter one bearing a siluer oare before Stranguidge, Shore, and two or three more piniond, and two or three with billes, and a hangman. Bra. stil. I dare not say good morrow, but ill day, That Harrie Stranguidge is thus cast away. Stran. Good cosin Brakenburie be as well content, To see mee die, as I to suffer death. Be witnesse that I die an honest man, Because my fact proues ill through ignorance, And for the Duke of Exeter his death, So speede my soule as I am innocent, Here goes my griefe, this guiltlesse Gentleman, Like Aesops Storke, that dies for companie, And came (God knowes) but as a passenger. Ah master Flud, a thousand flouds of woe, Ore-flow my soule, that thou must perish so. Sho. Good Captaine lette no perturbation, Hinder our passage to a better world, This last breaths blast wil wast our weary soules, Ouer deaths gulfe, to heauens most happie port. There is a little battaile to bee fought, This while the hangman prepares, Shoare at this speech mounts vp the ladder. Wherein by lotte the leading must bee mine, Second mee Captaine, and this bitter breakfast, Shall bring a sweeter supper with the Saints. D. S. This Christian patience at the point of death, Doth argue hee hath ledde no wicked life, How euer heauen hath laide this Crosse on him, Well Mathew Fludde, for so thou calst thy selfe, Finish a good course as thou hast begunne, And cleere thy conscience by confession, What knowst thou of the Duke of Exceters death? Sh. So God respect the waygate of my soule, as I know nothing. Doc. Sh. Then concerning this for which thou diest, knewe Stranguidge of the league betwixt the kings before hee tooke that prize? Sho. No in my conscience. D. Sha. Stranguidge what say you? You see theres but a turne betwixt your liues, You must bee next, confesse and saue your soule, Concerning that wherein I questionde him: I am your ghostly father to absolue You of your sinnes, if you confesse the truth. Stran. True D. Shaw, and as I hope for heauen, In that great day when wee shall all appeare, I neither knew how that good Duke came dead, Nor of the league, till I had tane the prize. Neither was Fludde, (that innocent dying man) Euer with mee but as a passenger. D. S. More happie he, wel Flud forgiue the world, As thou wilt haue forgiuenesse from the heauens. Sho. O so I doe, and pray the world forgiue, What wrong I did whilst I therein did liue, And now I pray you turne your paines to them, And leaue mee priuate for a little space, To meditate vpon my parting hence. D. Sha. Do gentle Flud, and we wil pray for thee. Sho. Pray not for Flud, but pray for Mathew Shoare, For Shoare couered with the cloake of Flud, aside. If I haue sinnde in chaunging of my name, Forgiue mee God, twas done to hide my shame, And I forgiue the world, King Edward first, That wrackte my state, by winning of my wife, And though hee would not pardon trespasse smal, In these, in me God knowes no fault at all. I pardon him, though guiltie of my fall. Perhaps he would, if hee had knowne twas I, But twentie deaths I rather wish to die. Than liue beholding for one minutes breath To him, that liuing, wounded me with death. Death of my ioy, and hell of my defame, Which now shall die vnder this borrowed name. Iane, God forgiue thee, euen as I forgiue, And pray thou maist repent while thou dost liue, I am as glad to leaue this loathed light, As to imbrace thee on our marriage night. To die vnknowne thus, is my greatest good, That Mathew Shoares not hangde, but Mathew Flud. For flouds of woe haue washt away the shore, That neuer wife nor kinne shall looke on more: Now when ye will, I am preparde to go. Enter Iockie running and crying. Iockie. Hawd, hawd, faye for speede, vntaye, vntrusse, pull down, pul off, God seaue the king: off with the helters, hence with the prisoners, a pardon, a pardon. Bra. Good newes vnlookte for, welcome gentle friend, who brings the pardon? Iockie. Stay first lat ma blaw: my mastres, mastres Shore shoe brings tha pardoune, tha kings pardoune: off with thore bands, bestow them o tha hangman, may mastres made mee runne the neerest way ore tha fields, she rayds apeace the hee way, shees at hawnd bay this: sirra yee that preech, come down, lat Doctor Shaw hea your place, hees tha better scholer, mastres Shoare brings a new lesson for you. Shoare. O I had read my latest lesson well. Had hee beene readie to haue said Amen. poynt to the hangman. Now shall I liue to see my shame agen. Shoare comes downe. O had I dide vnwitting to my wife, Rather then see her, though shee bring mee life. Enter Iane in haste, in her riding cloake and sauegard, with a pardon in her hand. Iane. Alas I see that euen my smallest stay, Had lost my labour, and cast them away, God knowes I hasted all that ere I might, Here maister Vaux, King Edward greetes ye well, His gracious pardon frees this Gentleman, And all his companie from shamefull death. All. God saue the king, and God blesse mistres Shore. Ioc. Amen, and kepe these frea comming here any meare. Ian. You must discharge them paying of their fees, Which for I feare their store is very small, I will defray, hold, here, take purse and all, Nay Maister Vaux tis gold, if not enough, Send to me, I will pay ye royally. Stran. Ladie, in the behalfe of all the rest, With humble thanks I yeeld my selfe your slaue, Command their seruice, and command my life. Ia. No Captain Stranguidge, let the king c?mand Your liues and seruice, who hath giuen you life, These and such offices conscience bids me doe. D. Sh. Pittie that ere awry she trode her shooe. Sho. O had that conscience prickt when loue prouokt. Bra. Ladie the last but not the least in debt, To your deuotion for my cosens life, I render thankes, yet thanks is but a breath, Command my seruice (Madame) during life, Old Brakenburie vowes for you to stand, Whil'st I haue limmes, or any foot of land. Sh. Thus is her glory builded on the sand. Ia. Thanks good M. Lieuetenant of the Tower. Sirra prepare my horse, why stay you here? to Iocky. Pray ye commend me to my noble friend The Duke of Clarence now your prisoner, Bid him not doubt the kings displeasures past I hope to gaine him fauour and release. Br. God graunt ye may, hees a noble gentlem?. Do. Sh. My patrone Gloster will crosse it if he can. Enter a Messinger. Nuntio. Wheres Mistresse Shoare? Ladie I come in post, The King hath had a verie dangerous fitte Since you came from him, twice his Maiestie, Hath swounded, and with much a doe reuiu de, And still as breath will giue him leaue to speake, He cals for you: the Queene and all the Lords Haue sent to seeke ye, hast vnto his Grace, Or els I feare you'l neuer see his face. Ia. O God defend, good friends pray for the king, More bitter are the newes which he doth bring, Then those were sweet I brought to you but late: If Edward die, confounded is my state, Ile hast vnto him, and will spend my bloud, To saue his life or do him any good. Exeunt she and the Messenger. Sh. And so would I for thee hadst thou been true: But if he die, bid all thy pompe adieu. Bra. Belieue me but I do not like these newes, Of the kings dangerous sicknesse. Keeper. No nor I, Captaine, and Maister Fludde, and all the rest, I do reioyce your pardon was obtaind, Before these newes, these inauspicious newes, If the king die, the state will soone be changde, M. Lieuetenant, you'l go to the Tower: Ile take my leaue, gallants God buoye all. Exeunt Vaux and his traine. St. God buoye M. Vaux, I wus ye ha lost good guesse. Bra. You shall be my guest for a night or two, Cosen, till your owne lodging be preparde, But tell me sir what meanes hath M. Fludde. Strang. I can not tell, ile aske him if ye will. Bra. Do so, and if his fortunes be debasde, Ile entertaine him if heele dwell with me, On good condition. Strang. M. Mathew Fludde, Heare ye my cosen Brakenburies mind? He hath conceiud such liking of your partes, That if your meanes surmount not his suppose, Heele entertaine ye gladly at the Tower, To waite on him, and put ye in great trust. Sho. In what I vndertake I will be iust, And hold me happie, if my diligence May please so worthy a Gentleman as he, What ere my fortunes haue been, they are now, Such as to seruice make their mayster bow. Bra. No Flud more like a friend &amp; fellow mate, I meane to vse thee, then a seruitor, And place thee in some credit in the Tower, And giue thee meanes to liue in some good sort. Sh. I thank ye sir, God grant I may deserue it. Bra. Cosen and all your crue come home with me, Where after sorrow we may merry be. Sho. The Tower will be a place of secret rest, Where I may heare good newes and bad, and vse the best, God blesse the king, a worse may weare the crowne, And then Iane Shore thy credit will come downe, For though ile neuer bed nor bord with thee, Yet thy destruction wish I not to see, Because I lou'de thee when thou wast my wife, Not for now sauing my disdained life, Which lasts too long, God grant vs both to mend, Well I must in my seruice to attend. Exit. The Lord Louell and Doctor Shaw meet on the Stage. Sha. Well met my good Lord Louell. Lo. Whither away so fast goes Doctor Shaw? Sha. Why to the Tower, to shriue the Duke of Clarence, Who as I heare is falne so grieuous sicke, As it is thought he can by no meanes scape. Lo. He neyther can nor shall I warrant thee. Sh. I hope my Lord he is not dead already? Lo. But I hope sir he is, I am sure I saw him dead, Of a Flies death, drownd in a butte of Malmesey. Sha. Dround in a butte of Malmesey? that is strange, Doubtlesse he neuer would misdoe himselfe? Lo. No, that thou knowest right well, he had some helpers, Thy hand was in it with the Duke of Glosters, As smothly as thou seekst to couer it. Sha. Oh fowle words my Lord, no more of that, The world knowes nothing, then what should I feare? Doth not your honour seeke promotion? Oh giue the Doctor then a little leaue, So that he gaine preferment with a king, Cares not who goes to wracke, whose hart doth wring. Lo. A king? what king? Sh. Why Richard man? who else? good Lord I see, Wise men sometimes haue weake capacitie. Lo. Why is not Edward liuing? and if he were not, Hath he not children? what shall become of them? Sh. Why man, lining for beds, a knife, or so, What make a boy a king, and a man by, Richard, a man for vs? fie that were a shame. L. Nay then I see if Edward were deceast, Which way the game would go. Sha. What else my Lord? That way the current of our fortune runnes, By noble Richard, gallant royall Richard, He is the man must onely doe vs good, So I haue honour, let me swimme through blood. My Lord, be but at Pauls crosse on Sunday next, I hope I haue it here shall soundly proue, King Edwards children not legitimate. Nay, and that for Edward ruling now, And George the Duke of Clarence so late dead: Their mother hapt to tread the shooe awry. Why what is Richard then? Sha. Tut, lawfull man, he sayes it so himselfe. And what he sayes ile be so bold as sweare, Though in my soule I know it otherwise. Beware promotion while you liue my Lord. Enter Catesbie. Ca. A staffe, a staffe, a thousand crownes for a staffe. Lo. What staffe Sir William Catesbie? Ca. Why man a white staffe for my Lord Protector. Lo. Why is king Edward dead? Ca. Dead Louel, dead, &amp; Richard our good Lord Is made Protector of the sweet young Prince. Oh for a staffe, where might I haue a staffe, That I might first present it to his hand? Sh. Now do I smell two Bishopricks at least, My sermon shall be pepperd sound for this. Enter Mistresse Shoare weeping, Iockie following. Ca. Why how now mistres Shoare? what, put finger in the eye, Nay then I see you haue some cause to crie. Lo. I blame her not, her chiefest stay is gone, The onely staffe, she had to leane vpon, I see by her these tidings are too true. Ian. I my Lord Louell, they are too true indeed, Royall king Edward now hath breath'd his last, The Queene turnd out, and euery friend put by, None now admitted, but whom Richard please. Lo. Why doubtlesse Richard wil be kind to you. Ia. Ah my Lord Louell, God blesse me from his kindnes: No sooner was the white staffe in his hand, But finding me and the right wofull Queene, Sadly bemoning such a mighty losse: Here is no place quoth he, you must be gone, We haue other matters now to thinke vpon. For you, (quoth he to me) and bit his lip, And stroke me with his staffe, but said no more. Whereby I know he meaneth me no good. Cat. Well Mistresse Shore, its like to be a busie time, Shift for your selfe, come lads let vs be gone, Royall King Richard must be waite vpon. Sh. Well mistres Shoare, if you haue need of me, You shall command me to the vttermost. Exeunt. Ian. First let me die ere I do put my trust, In any fliering Spaniel of you all. Go Iockie, take downe all my hangings, And quickly see my trunks be conuayde forth, To mistres Blages, an Inne in Lombardstreete, The Flower de Luce, good Iockie make some speed, She, she must be my refuge in this need. See it doone quickly Iockie. Exit. Iock. Whickly quoth a? marie heres a whicke chaunge in deede, sike whicke chaunge did I nere see before. Now dreame I, that ise be a very pure fellow, and hardly ha any siller to drinke with a gude fellow. But what stand I tatling here. I must go do my maistres bidding, carrie all her stuffe and geere to Mistres Blages, at the Flower de luce in Lombardstreet, whicke then dispatch. Exit. Enter Brakenburie, and Floud, to them the two young princes, Edward and Richard, Gloster, Cates. Louell, and Tirill. Bra. Come hither Floud let me heare thy opinion, Thou knowest I build vpon thy confidence, And honest dealing in my greatst affaires: I haue receiued letters from the Duke, Gloster I meane, Protector of the land, Who giues in charge the Tower be preparde, This night to entertaine the two young Princes, It is my duety to obey I know, But manifold supicion troubles me. Flo. He is their vncle Sir, and in that sence, Nature should warrant their securitie, Next his deceased brother at his death, To Richards care committed both the realme, And their protection: where humanitie Stands as an Orator to pleade against All wrong suggestion of vnciuill thoughts: Beside you are Lieuetenant of the Tower, Say there should be any hurt pretended, The priuiledge of your authoritie Pries into euery corner of this house, And what can then be done without your knowledge? Br. Thou sayest true Floud, though Richard be Protector, When once they are within the Tower limites, The charge of them (vnlesse he derogate) From this my office, which was neuer seene, In any kings time; doth belong to me: And ere that Brakenbury will consent, Or suffer wrong be done vnto these babes, His sword, and all the strength within the Tower Shall be opposde against the proudest commer, Be it to my soule as I intend to them. Fl. And faith in me vnto this commonwealth, And truth to men hath hitherto beene seene, The Pylot that hath guided my liues course, Though twas my fortune to be wrongd in both: And therefore Sir neither the mighties frowne, Nor any bribes shall winne me otherwise. Bra. Tis well resolued: still me thinks they should Be safe enough with vs, and yet I feare. But now no more, it seemes they are at hand. Pr. Ed. Uncle what Gentleman is that? enter Glost. It is (sweet Prince) Lieuetenant of the Tower. Pr. Ed. Sir we are come to be your guests to night: I pray you tell me did you euer know, Our father Edward lodgde within this place, Bra. Neuer to lodge (my liege) but oftentimes, On other occasions I haue seene him here. Ri. Brother last night when you did send for me, My mother told me, hearing we should lodge Within the Tower, that it was a prison, And therefore marueld that my vncle Gloster, Of all the houses for a kings receipt, Within this Citie, had appointed none, Where you might keep your court but only here. Gl. Uile brats, how they do descant on ye Tower. My gentle Nephew they were ill aduisde, To tutor you with such vnfitting tearmes, (Who ere they were) against this royall mansion: What if some part of it hath beene reseru'd, To be a prison for nobilitie? Followes it therefore that it cannot serue, To any other vse? Cesar himselfe That built the same, within it kept his Court, And many kings since him, the roomes are large, The building stately, and for strength beside, It is the safest and the surest hold you haue. Pr. Ed. Uncle of Gloster, if you thinke it so, Tis not for me to contradict your will, We must allow it, and are well content. Glo. On then a Gods name. Pr. E. Yet before we go, One question more with you M. Lieuetenant, We like you well, and but we do perceiue, More comfort in your lookes, then in these walles, For all our vncle Glosters friendly speech, Our hearts would be as heauie still as lead, I pray you tell me, at which dore or gate Was it my vncle Clarence did go in, When he was sent a prisoner to this place? Bra. At this my liege: why sighes your maiesty? Pr. Ed. He went in here that nere came back again, But as God hath decreede, so lette it be, Come brother shall we go? Fish. Yes brother, any where with you. Exeunt. Tirill pulles Catesby by the sleeue. Tir. Sir were it best I did attende the Duke, Or stay his leysure till his backe returne? Cat. I pray you maister Tirill stay without, It is not good you should be seene by day Within the Towre, especially at this time, Ile tell his honour of your beeing heere, And you shall know his pleasure presentlie. Tir. Euen so sir: men would be glad by any meanes, To raise themselues, that haue beene ouerthrowne, By fortunes scorne, and I am one of them. Enter Duke of Glocester. Here comes the Duke. Gloc. Catesby, is this the man? Cat. It is if like your excellence. Gloce. Come neere. Thy name I heare is Tirill, is it not? Tir. Iames Tirill is my name, my gracious Lord. Glo. Welcome, it should appeare that thou hast bin, In better state then now it seemes thou art. Tir. I haue bin by my fey my Lord, though now deprest, And clouded ouer with aduersitie. Glo. Be rulde by me, and then thou shalt rise again, And prooue more happie then thou euer wast, There is but onely two degrees, by which It shall be needfull for thee to ascend, And that is faith and taciturnitie. Tir. If euer I proue false vnto your grace, Conuert your fauour to afflictions. Glo. But canst thou too bee secret? Tirill. Trie mee my Lord: This tongue was neuer knowne to be a blab. Glo. Thy countenance hath like a siluer key, Opend the closet of my heart, reade there, If scholler like thou canst expound those lines, Thou art the man ordainde to serue my turne. Tir. So farre as my capacitie will reach, The sense my Lord is this, this night you say, The two yong Princes both must suffer death. G. Thou hast my meaning, wilt thou do it, speak? Tirill. It shall be doone. Glo. Inough, come follow me, For thy direction, and for gold to see, Such as must ayde thee in their Tragedy. Enter mistris Blage and Iockie Loden. Bla. Welcome good Iockie, what good newes bring you? Iockie. Marrie mastres my gude mastres greetes ye mastres, and praies ye mastres til dight vppe her Chamber, for sheell lig we ye to night mastres. And heres her catte skinne till she come. Enter Iane. Iane. Why how now loyterer? make ye no more haste? When will my trunkes and all my stuffe bee brought, If you thus loyter, go, make haste withall. Iockie. Marie sall aye, ginne yeele be bud petient a while. Exit. Iane. Now gentle mistris Blage the onely friend, That fortune leaues mee to relie vppon, My counsels Closet and my Towre of strength, To whom for safetie I retire my selfe, To be secure in these tempestuous times, O smile on mee, and giue me gentle lookes, If I be welcome, then with cheereful heart, And willng hand shew mee true signes thereof. Bla. Doubt yee of welcome Ladie to your friend? Nay to your seruant, to your beadswoman, To speake but truth, your bounties bondwoman: Use me, commande me, call my house your owne, And all I haue sweete Ladie at your will. Iane. Away with titles, lay by courtly tearmes, The Case is altred now the King is dead, And with his life my fauouring friendes are fled, No Madam now, but as I was before, Your faithfull kind companion, poore Iane Shoare. Bla. I loude you then, and since, and euer shall, You are the woman, though your fortunes fall, You when my husbands lewde transgression Of all our wealth had lost possession, By forfaiture into his Highnes handes, Got restitution of our goods and landes, He fled, and died in Fraunce, to heale that harme, You helpte me to three mannors in fee farme, The worst of which cleeres threescore pound a yeere, Haue I not reason then to hold yee deare? Yes happe what will vntill my life do end, You are and shall be my best loued friend, Iane. How if misfortune my follie do succeed. Bl. Trust me true fri?ds bide touch in time of need. Ia. If want consume the wealth I had before. Bl. My wealth is yours, &amp; you shall spend my store, Ia. But the protector prosecutes his hate, Bl. With me liue secret from the worlds debate, Ia. You will be wearie of so badde a guest, Bla. Then lette me neuer on the earth be blest. Ia. Ah mistris Blague, you tender mee such loue, As all my sorrowes from my soule remoue, And though my portion bee not verie large, Yet come I not to you to bee a charge, Coyne, plate, and iewels prizde at lowest rate, I bring with me to maintaine my estate, Worth twentie thousand pound, and my array, If you suruiue to see my dying day, From you no pennie will I giue away. Blage. And I thanke you that so my wealth increast, Am worth I trow, tenne thousand poundes at least, I thinke like two warme widdowes wee may liue, Untill good fortune two good husbands giue, For surely mistris Shoare your husbands dead, When heard yee of him? Iane. Neuer since hee fledde. O mistris Blage, nowe putte you in my head That kils my hart, why should I breath this aire, Whose lost good name no treasure can repaire? Oh were hee here with mee to leade his life, Although hee neuer vsde mee as a wife, But as a drudge to spurne mee with his feete, Yet should I thinke with him that life were sweete. Bla. How can ye once conceit so base a thing, That haue beene kist and cockerd by a king, Weepe not, yee hurt your selfe by Gods blest mother, Your husbands dead woman, thinke vpon another, Let vs in to supper, drinke wine, cheere your heart, And whilst I liue, be sure ile take your part. Exit. Enter Brakenburie, Shoare, Dighton, Forrest, Tirill. Tir. Sir I assure you tis my Lord Protectors warrant. Bra. My friend, I haue conferd it with his letters, And tis his hand indeede, Ile not denie, But blame mee not although I bee precise, In matters that so neerely do concerne mee. Dighton. My Lord protector, sir I make no doubt, Dare iustifie his warrant, though perhaps, He doth not nowe acquaint you why hee doth it. Bra I thinke sir theres no subiect now in England, Will vrge his grace, to shew what he dare do. Nor will I aske him why hee does it, I would I might, to ridde mee of my doubt. aside. Forrest. Why Sir I thinke hee needes no president, For what he does, I thinke his power is absolute inough. Bra. I haue no power sir to examine it. Nor will I do: I doe obey your warrant, Which I will keepe for my securitie. Tir. You shall do well in that sir. Bra. Heres the keyes. Sho. And yet I could wish my Lord protector, Had sent his warrant thither by some other, aside. I do not like their lookes I tell you true. Bra. Nor I Flud I assure thee. Forrest. what does that slaue mutter to his maister? Digh. I heare him say hee does not like our lookes? Tir. Why not our lookes Sir? Forrest. Sirra wee heare you. Sho. I am glad you doe sir? all is one for that, But if you did not hearken better now, I neuer saw three faces in whose lookes, Did euer sit more terror: or more death, God blesse the princes if it bee his will, I do not like these villaines. Dighton. Zounds stab the villaine, sirra do you braue vs? Sho. I thats your comming, for you come to stabbe. Forrest. Stabbe him. Shoare. Nay then ile stabbe with thee. Tirill. Zbloud cutte his throate. Braken. Hold Gentlemen I pray you. Shoare. Sir I am hurt, stabd in the arme, Braken. This is not to be iustified my friendes, To draw your weapons here within the Towre, And by the Lawe it is no lesse then death, I cannot thinke the Duke will like of this, I pray yee bee content, too much is doone. Tir. He might haue held his peace then, and beene quiet. Farewell, farewell. Shoare. Hell and damnation follow murderers. Bra. Goe Flud get thee some surgeon to look to thy wound, Hast no acquaintance with some skilfull surgeon? Keepe thy wound close, and let it not take aire. And for my owne part, I will not stay heere. Whither wilt thou Go that I may send to thee. Sho. To one mistris Blages, an Inne in Gracious streete, There you shall finde mee, or shall heare of mee. Braken. Sweete Princely babes, farewell I feare you sore, I doubt these eies shall neuer see you more. Enter the two yong Princes, Edward and Richard, in their gownes and cappes vnbuttond, and vntrust. Richard. How does your Lordshippe? Edward. Well good brother Richard, how does your self? You told mee your head aked. Richard. Indeede it does, my Lord feele with your hand how hotte it is. He laies his hand on his brothers head. Edward. Indeede you haue caught colde, With sitting yester night to heare mee reade, I pray thee goe to bedde, sweete Dicke poore little heart. Richard. Youle giue me leaue to waite vpon your Lordship. Edward. I had more neede brother to waite on you: For you are sick, and so am not I. Richard. O Lord, me thinks this going to our bed, How like it is to going to our graue: Edward. I pray thee do not speake of graues sweet heart, Indeede thou frightst mee. Ric. Why my Lord Brother, did not our Tutor teach vs, That when at night we went vnto our bedde, We still should thinke we went vnto our graue. Ed. Yes thats true, that we should do as euerie christian ought, To bee preparde to die at euerie howre, but I am heauie. Richard. Indeede and so am I. Edward. Then let vs say our prayers and go to bedde. They kneele, and solemne musicke the while within, the musicke ceaseth, and they rise. Richard. What, bleeds your Grace? Edward. I two drops and no more. Richard. God blesse vs both, and I desire no more. Edward. Brother see here what Dauid saies, and so say I, Lord in thee will I trust although I die. As the yong Princes go out, enter Tirill. Tirill. Go lay yee downe, but neuer more to rise, I haue put my hand into the foulest murder, That euer was committed since the world, The verie sencelesse stones here in the walles, Breake out in teares but to behold the fact, Me thinkes the Bodies lying dead in graues, Should rise and crie against vs, O hearke hearke, A noyse within The Mandrackes shreeks are musick to their cries, The verie night is frighted, and the starres, Do drop like torches, to beholde this deede: The verie Center of the earth doth shake, Me thinks the Tower should rent downe from the top, To let the heauen looke on this monstrous deede. Enter at one doore Dighton, with Edward vnder his arme, at the other doore Forrest with Richard. Dig. Stand further damned rogue, and come not neere me. Forrest. Nay stand thou further villaine, stand aside. Digh. Are we not both damned for this cursed deed. Forre. Thou art the witnesse that thou bearst the King. Dight. And what bearst thou? For. It is too true, oh I am damnde indeede, Hee lookes downe on the boy vnder his arme. Tir. I am as deepe as you, although my hand Did not the deede. Dighton. O villaine, art thou there? Forrest. A plague light on thee. Tir. Curse not, a thousand plagues will light vpon vs all. They lay them downe. The priest here in the Towre will burie them, Let vs away. Enter mistris Blage and her two men, bringing in Shore alias Flud, in a chaire, his arme bleeding apace. Blage. So, set him here awhile, where is more aire, How cheere you sir, alacke hee doth beginne To change his colour, where is mistris Shoare? Gone to her Closet for a precious Balme, The same shee said King Edward vsde himselfe. Bla. Alacke I feare heele die before shee come. Runne quickly for some Rosa-solis, faint not Sir, Be of good comfort, come good mistresse Shoare, What haue you there? Iane. Stand by and giue mee leaue. Bla. Unhappie me to lodge him in my house. Iane. I warrant you woman, be not so afraide, If not this bloud-stone hang about his necke, This balme will stanch it by the helpe of God: Lift vp his arme whilst I do bathe his wound, The signe belike was heere when hee was hurt, Or else some principall and cheefe veine is pierst. Bla. Howeuer sure the surgeon was a knaue, That lookte no better to him at the first. Ia. Blame him not mistris Blage, the best of them, In such a case as this may bee to seeke. Bla. Now God be blessed, see the Crimson bloud, That was precipitate, and falling downe Into his arme, retires into his Face, How fare you sir? how do you feele your selfe? Sh. Oh wherfore haue you wakte me from my sleep? And broke the quiet slumber I was in, Me thought I sate in such a pleasant place, So full of all delight as neuer eye Beheld, nor heart of man could comprehend, If you had let me go I felt no paine, But being now reuok't my griefe renewes. Ian. Giue him some Rosa solis mistres Blague, And that will likewise animate the sprites, And send alacritie vnto the heart, That hath been strugling with the pangs of death. Bla Here Sir drink this, you need not feare it sir, It is no hurt, see I will be your taster, Then drinke I pray you. Ian. Now fellowes raise his bodie from the chaire, And gently let him walke a turne or two. Bla. Good sooth mistres Shoare, I did not thinke till now You had been such a cunning skilde Phisitian. Sho. Oh Mistres Blague, though I must needs confesse, It would haue beene more welcome to my soule, If I had dyed and beene remoude at last, From the confused troubles of this world, Whereof I haue sustained no meane waight, Then lingring here be made a packhorse still Of torments, in comparison of which Death is but as the pricking of a thorne, Yet I do thanke you for your taken paines, And would to God I could requite your loue. Bl. Sir I did you little good, what was done Ascribe the benefite and praise thereof Unto this Gentlewoman, kind mistres Shoare, Who next to God preserude your feeble life. Sh. How? Mistresse Shoare good friends let go your hold, My strength is now sufficient of it selfe. Oh is it she that still prolongs my woe? Was it ordainde not onely at the first, She should be my destruction, but now twice, When gracious destinies had brought about, To end this weary pilgrimage of mine, Must she and none but she preuent that good, And stop my entrance to eternall blisse? Oh lasting plague, oh endlesse corasiue, It now repents me double that I scap'te, Since lifes made death, and lifes author hate. Ia. Sir take my counsell and sit downe againe, It is not good to be so bold of foot, Upon the sudden till you haue more strength. Sho. Mistres I thanke you, and I care not much If I be rulde by you. sits downe. Oh God that she should pittie me vnknowne, That knowing me by her was ouerthrowne, Or ignorantly she should regarde this smart, Enter Brakenb. That heretofore sparde not to stab my hart. Bra. By your leaue mistres Blague, I am somewhat bold, Is there not a Gentleman within your house, Cald M. Floud, came hither hurt last night? Bla. Is his name Floud, I knew it not till now, But here he is, and well recouered, Thankes to this Gentlewoman mistres Shoare. Br. Pardon me mistres Shoare, I saw you not, And trust me I am sorie at the hart, So good a creature as your selfe hath beene, Should be so vilely dealt with as you are, I promise you the world laments your case. Ia. How meane you sir? I vnderstand you not? Lament my case, for what? for Edwards death? I know that I haue lost a gracious friend, But that is not to be remedied now. Bra. No mistres Shoare, it is for Richards hate, That too much enuies your prosperitie. Ia. I know he loues me not and for that cause, I haue withdrawne me wholly from the Court. Bra. You haue not seene the Proclamation then? Ia. The proclamation? no, what proclamation? Bra. Oh Mistres Shore, the King in euery street Of London, and in euery borough towne, Throughout this land hath publikely proclaimde, On paine of death that none shall harbour you, Or giue you food or cloathes to keep you warme, But hauing first done shamefull penance here, You shall be then thrust forth the Citie gates, Into the naked cold forsaken field, I fable not, I would to God I did, See, heres the manner of it put in print, Tis to be sold in euery Stationers shoppe, Besides a number of them clapt on posts. Where people crowding as they reade your fall, Some murmure, and some sigh, but most of them, Haue their relenting eyes euen big with teares. Ia. Gods wil be done, I know my sinne is great, And he that is omnipotent and iust, Cannot but must reward me heauily. Bra. It grieues me mistresse Shoare, it was my chaunce, To be the first reporter of this newes. Ia. Let it not grieue, I must haue heard of it, And now as good, as at another time. Bra. I pray ye mistresse Blague haue care of Floud, And what his charge is I will see you paide. Exit Ia. Farewell to all that still shall be my song, Let men impose vpon me nere such wrong, And this extremitie shall seeme the lesse, In that I haue a friend to leane vnto, Sweet mistres Blague, there were vpon the earth, No comfort lest for miserable Iane, But that I do presume vpon your loue, I know though tyrant Rychard had set downe, A greater penaltie then is proclaimd, Which cannot well be thought, yet in your house, I should haue succour and reliefe be side. Bla. What, and so I should be a traitor, should I? Is that the care you haue of me and mine? I thanke you truely, no theres no such matter, I loue you well, but loue my selfe better: As long as you were held a true subiect, I made account of you accordingly, But being otherwise, I do reiect you, And will not cherish my kings enemie: You know the danger of the Proclamation: I would to God you would depart my house. Ia. When was it euer seene Iane Shore was false Eyther vnto her countrey, or her king? And therefore tis not well good mistres Blague, That you vpbraid me with a traitors name. Bl. I, but you haue beene a wicked liuer, And now you see what tis to be vnchaste, You should haue kept you wt your honest husband, Twas neuer other like but that such filthinesse, Would haue a foule and detestable end. Ia. Time was that you did tell me otherwise, And studied how to set a glosse on that Which now you say is vgly and deformde. Bla. I told you then as then the time did serue, And more in deed to trie your disposition, Then any way to incourage you to sinne: But when I saw you were ambitious, And faintly stood on tearmes of modestie, I left you to your owne arbiterment: Can you denie it was not so? how say you? Ia. We will not mistres Blague dispute of that, But now in charitie and womanhood, Let me find fauour if it be but this, That in some barne or stable I may shrowde, Till otherwise I be prouided for. Bla. I pray you do not vrge me mistres Shore, I will not haue my house indangered so. Oh you did promise I should neuer want, And that your house was mine, and swore ye same, To keepe your oath be then compassionate. Bla. So you did sweare you would be true to Shore, But you were not so good as your word, My oaths dispenst with by the kings command Ian. Yet me let haue those iewels &amp; that money, Which is within my trunkes. Bla. I know of none: If there be any, ile be so bold, As keepe it for your dyet and your mans, It is no little charge I haue beene at, To feede your dainty tooth, since you came hither, Beside houseroome, I am sure is somewhat worth. Sho. Ah Iane I cannot chuse but pittie thee, Heers the first step to thy deep miserie. Ia. Oh that my graue had then been made my house, When either first I went vnto the Court, Or from the Court returnd vnto this place. Enter two Apparators. Ser. How now, what are you? it had been maners You should haue knockt before you had come in. 1. Ap. We are the Bishops Parators my friend, And mistres Shore our errand is to you. This day it is commanded by the king, You must be stript out of your rich attire, And in a white sheete go from Temple barre, Untill you come to Aldgate, bare footed, Your haire about your eares, and in your hand, A burning taper, therefore go with vs. Ian. Euen when and whither you will, &amp; would to God, The king as soone could ridde my soule of sinne, As he may strip my bodie of these ragges. 2. Ap. That would be soone enough, but come away, And Mistresse Blague youle hardly answere it, When it is knowne we found her in your house, 1. Ap. It seemes you do not feare to harbour her. Bla. I harbor her? out on her strumpet queane, She prest vpon me where I would or no: Ile see her hangd ere I will harbour her. So now her iewels and her gold is mine, And I am made at least foure thousand pound, Wealthier by this match then I was before: And what can be obiected for the same, That once I lou de her: well perhaps I did, And women all are gouernd by the Moone, But now I am of another humour, Which is you know a Planet that will chaunge. Cat. Now M. Sheriffe of London do your office, Attach this rebell to his Maiestie, And hauing stript her to her petticoate, Turne her out a dores, with this condition, That no man harbour her, that durst presume To harbor that lewd curtizan Shores wife, Against the strait commandment of the king. Bla. I beseech you Sir. Cat. Away with her I say. The while ile seaze vpon her house and goods, Which wholly are confiscate to the king. Exit. Sho. Oh what haue I beheld, were I as young, As when I came to London to be prentice, This pageant were sufficient to instruct, And teach me euer after to be wise. First haue I seene desert of wantonnesse, And breach of wedlocke: then of flatterie, Next of dissembling loue, and last of all, The ruine of base catching auarice: But poore Iane Shore in that I lou'd thee once, And was thy husband I must pittie thee, The sparkes of old affection long ago, Rakte vp in ashes of displeasure kindle, And in this furnace of aduersitie, The world shall see a husbands loyaltie. Exit. Enter Doctor Shaw pensiuely reading on his booke, after him followes the Ghost of Frier Anselme, with a lighted torch. Sha. Spuria vitulamina non agent radices altas, Bastardly slips haue alwaies slender growth. Ah Shaw, this was the cursed theame, That at Pauls crosse thou madest thy sermon of, To proue the lawfull issue of thy king, Got out of wedlocke, illegittimate. Ah Duke of Gloster this didst thou procure. Did Richard (villaine) no it was thy fault, Thou wouldst be wonne to such a damned deed, Which now to thinke on makes my soule to bleed. Ah Fryer Anselme, sleepe among the blest, Thy prophesie thus falsely did I wrest. Enter Anselme. An. Thou didst, and be thou damnde therefore, Nere come thy soule where blessednesse abides, Didst thou not know the letter G. was Gloster? Sh. Anselme I did. An. Why then didst thou affirme, That it was meant by George the Duke of Clarence, That honourable harmelesse Gentleman, Whose thoughts all innocent as any child, Yet came through thee to such a lucklesse death. Sha. I was inforced by the Duke of Gloster. An. Enforst sayst thou? wouldst thou then be enforste, Being a man of thy profession, To sinne so vilely, and with thine owne mouth, To damne thy soule? No thou wast not enforc't, But gaine and hope of high promotion Hyrde thee thereto, say was it so or no? Sha. It did, it did. An. Why then record in thy blacke hellish thoughts, How many mischiefes hath ensude hereon? First, wronged Clarence drowned in the Tower, Next, Edwards children murdred in the Tower: This day at Pomfret noble Gentlemen, Three the Queenes kinred, lose their harmelesse heads. Thinkst thou that here this floud of mischiefe stayes? No villaine, many are markt to the blocke, And they the nearest, thinke them furthest off, Euen Buckingham, creator of that King, Shall he to woe and wretched ending bring. All this (accursed man) hath come by thee, And thy false wresting of my prophecie, For Englands good disclosed to thy trust, And so it had beene, hadst thou proued iust. But thou and euery one that had a hand, In that most wofull murther of the Princes, To fatall ends you are appointed all. Here in thy studie shalt thou sterue thy selfe, And from this houre not taste one bit of food, The rest shall after follow on a row, To all their deathes, vengeance will not be slowe. Enter a messenger to Shaw. Mes. Where is M. Doctor Shaw? Sh. Here friend, what is thy will with me? Me. K. Richard praies ye to come to him strait, For he would be confest. Sh. I cannot come, I pray thee take that Frier, For he can do it better farre then I. Mes. A Fryer M. Doctor? I see none. Sh. Doost thou not? no, thy vntainted soule Cannot discerne the horrors that I do. An. Shaw, go with him, &amp; tell that tirant Richard, He hath but three yeares limited for life, And then a shameful death takes hold on him, That done, returne, and in thy studie ende Thy loathed life that didst vs all offend. Sha. With all my heart, would it were ended now, So it were done, I care not where nor how. Exeunt. Enter the two Parators, with mistris Shoare in a white Sheete, bare footed, with her haire about her eares, and in her hand a waxe taper. 1 Par. Now mistris Shoare, here our commission ends, Put off your roabe of shame, for this is Algate, Whither it was appoynted we should bring you. Ia. My roabe of shame? Oh that so foule a name Should be applyed vnto so faire a garment, Which is no more to bee condemnde of shame, Then snow of putrefaction is deserude, To couer an infectious heape of dung, My roabe of shame, but not my shame putte off, For that sits branded on my forehead still, And therefore in derision was I wrapt, In this white Sheete: and in derision bore This burning Taper, to expresse my follie, That hauing light of reason to direct mee, Delighted yet in by-waies of darke error. 2 p. Well mistris Shore, I hope you grudge not vs, We shewde you all the fauour poore men could. Ia. Oh God forbid: I know the kings Edict, Set you a worke, and not your owne desires. 1 par I truely mistris, and for our parts, We could be well content twere otherwise, But that the lawes seuere, &amp; so wee leaue you. Exit. Iane. Farewell vnto you both: and London too, Farewell to thee, where first I was inticde, That scandalizde thy dignitie with shame, But now thou hast returnde me treble blame, My tongue that gaue consent inioynde to beg. Mine eies adiudgde to hourely laments, Mine armes for their imbracings, catch the aire, And these quicke nimble feete that were so readie To step into a Kings forbidden bedde, London thy flints haue punisht for their pride, And thou hast drunke their bloud for thy reuenge, What now auailes to thinke what I haue beene, Then welcome nakednes and pouertie, Welcome contempt, welcome you barren fields, Welcome the lacke of meate, and lacke of friends, And wretched Iane, according to thy state, Sit heere, sit heere, and lower if might be, All things that breathe in their extremitie, Haue some recourse of succor, thou hast none, The child offended flies vnto the mother, The Souldiour strucke, retires vnto his Captaine, The fish distressed, slides into the riuer, Birdes of the aire do flie vnto their dammes, And vnderneath their wings are quickly shrouded, Nay, beate the spanniell, and his maister mones him, But I haue neither where to shrowde my selfe, Nor any one to make my mone vnto, Come patience then, and though my bodie pine, Make then a banquet to refresh my soule, Let hearts deepe throbbing sighes be all my bread, My drinke salt teares my guests repentant thoughts, That who so knew me, and dooth see me now, May shunne by me the breach of wedlocks vow. Enter Brakenburie with a prayer booke, and some releefe in a cloath for mistris Shoare. Bra. Oh God how full of daungers growes these times, And no assurance seene in anie state, No man can say that hee is maister nowe, Of any thing is his, such is the tide Of sharpe disturbance running through the land, I haue giuen ouer my office in the Tower, Because I cannot brooke their vile complots, Nor smoother such outragious villanies: But mistris Shoare, to be so basely wrongde, And vildly vsde, that hath so well deserude, It doth afflict mee in the verie soule, She saude my kinsman, Harrie Stranguidge life, Therefore in dutie am I bound to her, To do what good I may, though law forbidde, See where she sits, God comfort thee good soule, First take that to releeue thy bodie with, And next, receiue this booke, wherein is foode, Manna of heauen to refresh thy soule: These holy meditations mistris Shoare, Will yeeld much comfort in this miserie, Whereon contemplate still, and neuer linne, That God may be vnmindfull of thy sinne. Iane. Maister Lieutenant, in my heart I thank ye, For this kind comfort to a wretched soule: Welcome sweete prayer-booke, foode of my life, The soueraigne balme for my sicke conscience: Thou shalt bee my soule pleasure and delight, To wipe my sinnes out of Iehouaes sight. B. Do so good mistris Shoare, now I must leaue ye, Because some other businesse calles me hence, And God I pray regard your penitence. Exit. Ia. Farewell sir Robert, and for this good to mee, The God of heauen bee mindfull still of thee. As she sits weeping &amp; praying, enters at one doore yong M. Aire, and old Rufford at another. Aire. This way she went, and cannot be farre off, For but euen now I met the officers, That were attendant on her in her penance, Yonder shee sits, now then Aire shewe thy selfe, Thankfull to her, that sometime saude thy life, When Law had made thee subiect to base death, Giue her thy purse, for here comes some Ladie, Stand by a while, for feare thou be discouered. Ruf. What mistris Shoare, king Edwards concubine, Set on a mole-hil, oh disparagement. A throne were fitter for your Ladishippe, Fie will you slubber these faire cheekes with teares? Or sit so solitarie, wheres all your seruants? Where is your gowne of silke, your periwigges, Your fine rebatoes, and your costly Iewels, What not so much as a shooe vppon your foote, Nay then I see the world goes hard with whoores. Aire. The villaine slaue gibes at her miserie. Ruf. Now whether is it better to bee in court, And there to begge a licence of the King, For transportation of commodities, Then here to sit forsaken as thou doost, I thinke vpon condition Edward liude, And thou were still in fauour as before, Thou wouldst not say that Rufford had deserude, To haue his eares rent for a worser suite. Then licence to shippe ouer corne and lead, What not a word, faith wench ile tell thee what, If thou dost thinke thy old trade out of date, Go learne to play the bawde another while. Ai. Inhumane wretch, why dost thou scorne her so, And vexe her grieued soule with bitter taunts? Ruf. Because I will, shee is a curtisan, And one abhorred of the world for lust. Aire. If all thy faults were in thy forehead writ, Perhaps thou wouldst thy selfe appeare no lesse, But much more horrible then she doth now. Ruf. You are no iudge of mine sir. Aire. Why nor thou of her. R. The world hath iudgde, and found her guilty, And tis the kings command she be held odious. Ai. The King of heauen commandeth otherwise, And if thou be not willing to releeue her, Let it suffize thou seest her miserable, And studie not to amplifie her griefe. Enter mistresse Blage verie poorely a begging, with her basket and clap-dish. What other woful spectacle comes heere? Mistresse take that and spende it for my sake. When Rufford lookes away, Aire throwes his purse, to mistris Shoare. Bla. Oh I am pinchte with more then common want, Where shall I finde releefe? Good Gentlemen, Pittie a wretched woman, like to starue, And I will pray for yee. One halfepenie For Christs sake, to comfort mee withall. Ruf. What mistris Blage, ist you? no maruaile sure, But you should be releeude, a halfe penie quotha? I marie sir, and so bee hangde my selfe, Not I, this Gentleman may if he please, Get ye to your companion mistresse Shoare, And then there is a paire of queanes well met, Now I bethinke mee, ile go to the king, And tell him that some will releeue Shoares wife, Except some officer there bee appoynted, That carefully regardes it be not so. Thereof my selfe will I make offer to him, Which questionlesse hee cannot but accept, So shal I stil pursue Shoares wife with hate, That scorned mee in her high whoores estate. Exit. Bla. Good Gentleman bestow your Charitie, One single halfpenie to helpe my neede. Aire. Not one, were I the maister of a mint, What? succour thee that didst betray thy friend? See where she sits, whom thou didst scorne indeed, And therefore rightly art thou scornde againe: Thou thoughtst to beene riched with her goods, But thou hast now lost both thy owne and hers, And for my part, knew I twould saue thy life, Thou shouldst not get so much as a crum of bread, Packe counterfeit, packe away dissembling drab. Bla. Oh miserie, but shall I stay to looke Her in the face, whom I so much haue wrongde? Ia. Yes mistris Blage, I freely pardon you, You haue done mee no wrong, come sit by mee: Twas so in wealth, why not in pouertie? Bla. Oh willingly, if you can brooke her presence, Whom you haue greater reason to despise. Ia. Why woman, Richard that hath banisht me, And seekes my ruine (causelesse though it bee) Do I in heart pray for, and will do still, Come thou &amp; share with me what God hath sent, A stranger gaue it mee, and parte thereof I do as freely nowe bestow on you. Bla. I thanke you mistris Shoare, this curtesie Renewes the griefe of my inconstancie. Enter maister Shoare with releefe for his wife. Sho. Yonder shee sits, how like a withered tree, That is in winter leauelesse and bereft Of liuely sappe, sits shee poore abiect soule, How much vnlike the woman is shee now, She was but yesterday: so short and brittle Is this worlds happines: but who is that, False mistris Blague? how canst thou brooke her Iane? I thou wast alwaies milde and pittifull, Oh hadst thou beene as chaste, we had beene blest, But now no more of that: shee shall not starue, So long as this, and such as this may serue, Here mistris Shoare, feed on these homely Cates, And there is wine to driue them downe withall. Ia. Good sir your name, that pitties poore Iane Shore, That in my prayers I may remember you. Sho. No matter for my name, I am a friend, That loues you well, so farewell mistris Shoare, When that is spent, I vow to bring you more. Ia. Gods blessing bee your guide where ere you go, Thus mistris Blague you see amidst our woe, For all the world can doe, God sends releefe, And will not yet wee perish in our griefe: Come let vs steppe into some secret place. Bla. Tis not amisse if you bee so content, For here the fieldes too open and frequent. Exeunt. Where vndisturbde we may partake this grace. Maister Shoare enters againe. Sho. What is shee gone so soone? alacke poore Iane, How I compassionate thy wofull case? Whereas wee liude togither man and wife, Oft on an humble stoole by the fire side, Sate she contented, when as my high heate, Would chide her for it. But what would shee say? Husband, we both must lower sitte one day, When I dare sweare shee neuer dreamd of this, But see good God what prophesying is. Enter Rufford and Fogge, with the counterfeit Letters Pattents, Shore stands aside. Ruff. This is King Richards hand, I knowe it wel, And this of thine is iustly counterfeit, As hee himselfe would sweare it were his owne. Shoare. The kings hand counterfeit? list more of that. Rufford. Why euerie letter, euerie little dash, In all respects alike, nowe may I vse, My transportation of my corne and Hydes, Without the danger of forbidding lawe, And so I would haue doone in Edwardes dayes, But that good mistresse Shoare did please to crosse mee, But marke how n w I will requite her for it. I mooude my suite, and plainely tolde the king, Some would releeue her, if no man had charge, To see seuerely to the contrarie. Forthwith his Grace appoynted mee the man, And gaue mee officers to waite vppon mee, Which will so countenance thy cunning worke, As I shall no way be suspected in it: how sayst thou Fogge? Fogge. It will do well indeede: But good sir haue a care in any case, For else you know what harme may come thereon. Ruff. A care saist thou? why man, I will not trust My house, my strongest locks, nor any place, But mine owne bosome, there will I keepe it still, If I miscarrie, so dooth it with mee. Shoare. Are yee so cunning sir, I say no more, Iane Shoare or I may quittance you for this. Exit. Ruff. Well Fogge I haue contented thee, Thou maist be gone, I must about my charge, To see that none releeue Shoares wife with ought. Exit F. Enter the Officers with billes. Come on good fellowes, you that must attende, King Richards seruice vnder my commaund, Your charge is to be verie vigilant, Ouer that strumpet whome they call Shoares wife: If any traitour giue her but a mite, A draught of water, or a crust of bread, Or any other foode what ere it bee, Lay holde on him, for it is present death, By good King Richards proclamation, This is her haunt, heere stand I Sentinell, Keepe you vnseene, and aide mee when I call. Enter Iockie and Ieffrey, with a bottle of Ale, Cheese, &amp; halfepenny loaues, to play at bowles, mistres Shore enters and sits where she was wont. Iock. Now must I vnder colour of playing at bowles, helpe till relieue my gude maistres, maistres Shore. Come Ieffrey, we will play fiue vp for this bottle of Ale, and yonder gude pure woman shall keepe the stakes, this cheese shall be the measter. They play still toward her, and Iockie often breakes bread and cheese, and giues her, till Ieffrey being calde away, then he giues her all, and is apprehended. Ruf. Here is a villaine, that will not relieue her, But yet heele loose his bowls, that way to help her. Apprehend him fellowes when I bid ye: Although his mate be gone, he shall pay for it. Take him, and let the Beadles whip him well. Iock. Heare ye sir, shall they be whipt and hangd that giue to the pure, then they shall bee damne that take fro the pure. They lead him away. Enter young Ayre againe, and Shoare stands aloofe off. Aire. Oh yonder sits the sweet forsaken soule, To whom for euer I stand deepely bound: She sau'de my life, then Ayre help to saue hers. Ruf. Whither go ye Sir? You come to giue this strumpet some reliefe. Air. She did more good then euer thou canst doe, And if thou wilt not pittie her thy selfe, Giue others leaue, by dutie bound thereto: Here mistres Shore, take this, and would to God It were so much as my pore hart could wish. He giues her his purse. Shor. Who is it that thus pitties my poore wife? Tis M. Aire, Gods blessing on him for it. Ruf. Darest thou do so Aire? Air. Rufford I dare do more: Here is my ring, it waighes an ounce of gold, And take my cloke to keepe ye from the cold. Ruf. Thou art a traitor Aire. Air. Rufford, thou art a villaine so to call me. Ruf. Lay hold on him, attach him officers. Air. Rufford, ile answere thine arrest with this. He drawes his rapier, but is apprehended. Ruf. All this contending Sir will not auaile, This treason will be rated at thy life. Air. Life is too little for her sake that sau'de it. Sho. Is he a traitor Sir, for doing good? God saue the king, a true hart meanes no ill. I trust he hath reclaimde his sharpe edict, And will not that his porest subiect perish, And so persuaded I my selfe will doe, That which both loue and nature binds me to. I cannot giue her as she well deserues, For she hath lost a greater benefite. Pore woman take that purse. Ruf. Ile takte away. Sho. You shall not Sir, for I will answere it, Before the King if you inforce it so. Ruf. It must be so, you shall vnto the king. Sh. You will be he will first repent the thing: Come M. Ayre ile beare ye companie, Which wise men say doth ease calamitie, Exeunt. Ia. If griefe to speech free passage could afford, Or for ech woe I had a fitting word, I might complaine, or if my flouds of teares, Could moue remorse of minds, or pearce dul eares, Or wash away my cares, or cleanse my crime: With words &amp; teares I would bewaile the time. But it is bootlesse, why liue I to see, All those dispised that do pittie me. Dispisde? alas, destroyed, and led to death, That gaue me almes here to prolong my breath. Faire Dames behold, let my example proue, There is no loue like to a husbands loue. Exit. Enter K. Richard, Louell, Catesbie, Rufford, Shore, &amp; Aire pinioned, and led betwixt two Officers. Glo. Now tell vs Rufford which of these it is, That in the heate of his vpheaued spleene, Contemnes our crowne, disdaines our dignitie, And armes himselfe against authoritie. Ru. Both haue offended my dread Soueraigne, Though not alike, yet both faults capitall, These lines declare what, when, &amp; where it was. Glo. Which is that Aire? Ruf. This young man my Liege. Glo. I thought it was some hot distempred blood, That fierd his gyddie braine with businesse: Is thy name Ayer? Air. It is Glo. This paper sayes so. Air. Perish may he that made that paper speake. Gl. Ha? Dost thou wish confusion vnto vs? This paper is the Organe of our power, And shall pronounce thy condemnation, We make it speake thy treasons to thy face, And thy malicious tongue speakes treason still. Relieust thou Shores wife in contempt of vs? Air. No but her iust desert, She saude my life, which I had forfeyted, UUhereby my goods and life she merited. Glo. And thou shalt pay it in the selfe same place, Where thou this man our Officer didst out face, And scorndst vs saying if we stoode by, Thou wouldst relieue her. Ay. I do not deny, For want of foode her breath was neere expirde, I gaue her meanes to buy it vndesir'de, And rather chuse to die for charitie, Then liue condemned of ingratitude. Gl. Your good deuotion brings you to the gallows, He hath his sentence, Rufford see him hangd. They leade out Aire. Now sir your name? Sho. Is it not written there? Glo. Heres Mathew Floud. Ruf. That is his name my Lord. Glo. Is thy name Floud? Sho. So M. Rufford sayes. Glo. Floud and Ayre? the elements conspire, In ayre and water to confound our power: Didst thou relieue that hatefull wretch Shores wife? Sho. I did relieue that wofull wretch Shores wife. Gl. Thou seemst a man well staid and temperate, Durst thou infringe our proclamation? Sho. I did not breake it. Ruf. Yes, and added more, That you would answere it before the king. Sh. And added more, you would repent the thing. Ru. Who, I? his Highnes knowes my innocence, And ready seruice with my goods and life, Answere thy treasons to his maiestie. Glo. What canst thou say Floud why thou shouldst not die? Sho. Nothing, for I am mortall and must die, When my time comes, but that I thinkes not yet, Although (God knowes) ech houre I wish it were, So full of dolor is my weary life: Now say I this, that I do know the man, Which doth abette that traiterous libeller, Who did compose &amp; spread that slaunderous rime, Which scandals you, and doth abuse the time. Glo. What libeller? another Collingborne? That wrote: The Cat, the Rat, &amp; Louell our Dog, Do rule all England vnder a Hog. Canst thou repeate it Floud? Sho. I thinke I can if you command me so. Glo. We do command thee. Sho. In this sort it goes: The crook backt Boare the way hath found, To root our Roses from our ground, Both flower and bud will he confound, Till King of beasts the swine be crownd: And then the Dog, the Cat, and Rat, Shall in his trough feed and be fat. Finis quoth M. Fogge, chiefe secretary and counsellor to M. Rufford. Glo. How sayest thou Floud, doth Rufford foster this? Sho. He is a traitor if he do my Lord. Ruf. I foster it? dread Lord I aske no grace, If I be guiltie of this libelling, Uouchsafe me iustice as you are my Prince, Against this traitor that accuseth me. Sh. What iustice crau'st thou? I wil combat thee, In signe whereof I do vnbutton me, And in my shirt my challenge will maintaine, Thou cal st me traitor, I will proue thee one, Open thy bosome like me if thou darest? Ruf. I will not be so rude before his grace. Sh. Thou wilt not ope the packe of thy disgrace, Because thy doublets stuft with traiterous libels. Gl. Catesby teare off the buttons from his breast, What findst thou there? Cat. Your Highnes hand and seale, For transportation of Hydes, Corne and Leade. Glo. Traitor, did I signe that commission? Ruf. O pardon me most royall king. Glo. Pardon? to counterfet my hand and seale? Haue I bestowed such loue, such countenance? Such trust on thee, and such authoritie, To haue my hand and signet counterfet? To carrie Corne the food of all the land, And Leade, which after might annoy the land, And Hydes, whose leather must relieue the land, To strangers enemies vnto the land: Didst thou so neerely counterfet my hand? Ruf. Not I my liege, but Fogge the Atturney. Glo. Away with him Louell and Catesbie, go, Command the Sheriffes of London presently, To see him drawne, and hangd, and quartered, Let them not drinke before they see him dead. Hast you againe. Louel and Catesb. leade out Rufford. Ruf. Well Floud thou art my death, I might haue liu'de t'haue seene thee lose thy head. Sho. Thou hast but iustice for thy crueltie, Against the guiltlesse soules in miserie, I aske no fauour if I merit death. Glo. Crau st thou no fauour? then I tell thee Floud, Thou art a traitor breaking our Edict, By succouring that traitrous queane Shores wife. And thou shalt die. Sho. If I haue broke the law. Gl. If traitor? didst thou not giue her thy purse? And doest thou not maintaine the deede? Enter Louell and Cat. againe. Sho. I do, if it be death to the relenting hart, Of a kind husband, wronged by a king, To pittie his poore weake seduced wife, Whom all the world must suffer by command, To pine and perish for the want of foode: If it be treason for her husband then, In the deare bowels of his former loue, To bury his owne wrong and her misdeed, And giue her meate whom he was wont to feede, Then Shore must die, for Floud is not my name, Though once I tooke it to conceale my shame, Pittie permits not iniured Shore passe by, And see his once loude wife with famine die. Glo. Louell and Catesbie, this is Shore indeed, Shore, we confesse that thou hast priuiledge, And art excepted in our Proclamation, Because thou art her husband whom it concernes, And thou mayest lawfully relieue thy wife, Upon condition thou forgiue her fault, Take her againe, and vse her as before, Hazard new hornes, how sayest thou, wilt thou Shore? Sho. If any but your Grace should so vpbraid, Such rude reproch should roughly be repaid. Suppose for treason that she lay condemnd, Might I not feede her till her houre of death, And yet my selfe no traitor for it? Glo. Thou mightst. Sh. And why not now (O pardon me dread Lord) When she hath had both punishment and shame Sufficient, since a King did cause her blame, May I not giue her food to saue her life, Yet neuer take and vse her as my wife? Glo. Except thou take her home againe to thee, Thou art a stranger and it shall not be, For if thou do expect what doth belong. Sho. I neuer can forget so great a wrong. Glo. Then neuer feed her whom thou canst not loue. Sho. My charitie doth that compassion moue. Gl. Moue vs no more, Louel let Aire be hangd, Iust in the place where he relieud Shores wife: Shore hath his pardon for this first offence. The name of husband pleades his innocence, Away with them: Catesbie come you with vs? Exeunt. Iockie is led to whipping ouer the stage, speaking some wordes, but of no importance. Then is young Ayre brought forth to execution, with the Sheriffe and Officers, Mistres Shoare weeping, and M. Shoare standing by. Ayre. Good mistres Shore, grieue me not with your tears, But let me go in quiet to mine end. Ia. Alas poore soule, UUas neuer innocent thus put to death. Air. The mores my ioy, that I am innocent, My death is the lesse grieuous, I am so. Ia. Ah M. Aire the time hath beene ere now, When I haue kneeld to Edward on my knees, And begd for him, that now doth make me beg. I haue giuen him, when he hath begd of me, Though he forbids to giue me when I beg, I haue ere now relieued him and his, Though he and his deny reliefe to me: Had I beene enuious then, as Richard now, I had not staru'd, nor Edwards sons bin murdred, Nor Richard liu'de to put you now to death. Air. The more Iane is thy vertue and his sinne. Sher. Come Sir dispatch. Air. Dispatch say you? dispatch you may it call, He cannot stay when death dispatcheth all. Ia. Lord, is my sinne so horrible and grieuous, That I should now become a murderer? I haue sau'de the life of many a man condemnd, But neuer was the death of man before. That any man thus for my sake should die, Afflicts me more then all my miserie. Air. Iane be content, I am as much indebted vnto thee, As vnto nature, I owed thee a life, When it was forfeit vnto death by lawe, Thou begdst it of the king and gaust it me: This house of flesh wherein this soule doth dwell, Is thine, and thou art Landladie of it, And this poore life a Tenant but at pleasure, It neuer came to pay the rent till now, But hath runne in arerage all this while, And now for verie shame comes to discharge it, When death distraines for what is but thy due, I had not ought thee so much as I doe, But by thy onely mercie to preserue it, Untill I loose it for my charitie. Thou giu st me more then euer I can pay, Then do thy pleasure executioner, And now farewel kind vertuous mistresse Shoare, In heauen weele meete againe, in earth no more. Here he is executed. Ia. Farewel, farewel, thou for thy almes dost die, And I must end here starude in miserie, In life my friend, in death ile not forsake thee, Thou goest to heauen, I hope to ouertake thee. Shoare. Oh world what art thou? man, euen from his birth, Findes nothing else but miserie on earth, Thou neuer (World) scorn dst mee so much before, But I (vaine world) doo hate thee tenne times more. I am glad I feele approaching death so nie, World thou hatest mee, I thee vaine worlde defie. I pray yee yet good maister officers, Do but this kindnesse to poore wretched soules, As let vs haue the buriall of our friende, It is but so much labour saude for you. She. There take his bodie, burie it where you wil, So it be quickly doone out of the way. Exit Sherife and Officers. Iane. Whats he that begges the burial of my friend, And hath so oftentimes releeued mee? Ah gentle sir, to comfort my sadde woe, Let mee that good kinde man of mercie know. Sho. Ah Iane, now there is none but thou and I, Looke on mee well, knowest thou thy Ma. Shoare. Ia. My Husband? then breake and liue no more. She swounds, and he supports her in his armes. Sho. Ah my deere Iane, comfort thy heauie soule, Goe not away so soone, a little stay, A little, little while, that thou and I, Like man and wife may here together die. Iane. How can I looke vpon my husbands face, That shamde my selfe, and wrought his deep disgrace? Sho. Iane bee content, our woes are now alike, With one selfe rod thou seest God doth vs strike, If for thy sinne, ile pray to heauen for thee, And if for mine, doe thou as much for mee. Iane. Ah Shoare, ist possible thou canst forgiue mee? Shoare. Yes Iane, I doe. Iane. I cannot hope thou wilt: My faults so great that I cannot expect it. Sho. Ifaith I doo, as freely from my soule, As at Gods hands I hope to bee forgiuen. Ia. Then God reward thee, for wee now must part, I feele cold death doth seize vppon my heart. Sho. And hee is come to mee, heere hee lies, I feele him readie to close vp mine eies, Lend mee thy hand to burie this our friend, And then wee both will hasten to our end. Heere they putte the bodie of yong Aire into a Coffin, and then hee sits downe on the one side of it, and shee on the other. Iane sit thou there, heere I my place will haue, Giue mee thy hand, thus wee embrace our graue, Ah Iane, he that the depth of woe will see, Let him but now beholde our misery, But be content, this is the best of all, Lower then now we are, wee cannot fall. Iane. Ah, I am faint, how happy Ayre art thou, Not feeling that which doth afflict vs now? Sho. Oh happie graue, to vs this comfort giuing, Heere lies two liuing dead, here one dead liuing, Here for his sake, loe this we doe for thee, Thou lookste for one, and art possest of three. Ia. Oh dying marriage, oh sweete married death, Thou graue which only shouldst part faithful friends, Bringst vs togither, and dost ioyne our handes, Oh liuing death, euen in this dying life, Yet ere I go, once Mathew kisse thy wife. He kisses her, and shee dies. S. Ah my sweete Iane, farewell, farewel poore soule, Now tyrant Richard doo the worst thou canst, She doth defie thee, oh vnconstant world, Here lies a true Anotomie of thee, A king had all my ioye, that her inioyde, And by a king againe shee was destroyde: All ages of my kingly woes shall tell, Once more inconstant world farewell, farewell. He dies. Enter Sir Robert Brakenburie, with two or three of his seruants. Bra. Sirs if the king, or else the Duke of Buckingham Do send for mee, I will attende them straight, But what are these heere openly lie dead, Oh God, the one is mistresse Shoare, and this is Flud, That was my man: the third is Maister Ayre, Who suffered death for his releeuing her, They shall not thus lie in the open way, Lend me your hands, and heauie hearts withall, At mine owne charge Ile giue them buriall. They beare them thence. Enter King Richard crowned, Buckingham, Aire of Warwicke, Louell, Catesbie, Fogge, and attendants. Richard. Most noble Lordes, since it hath pleased you, Beyonde our expectation on your bounties, T'empale my temples with the Diademe. How farre my quiet thoughts haue euer beene, From this great and maiesticke soueraigntie, Heauen best can witnesse: I am your King, Long may I bee so, to deserue your loue, But I will be a seruant to you all, Pray God my broken sleepes may giue you rest. But onely that my bloud doth challenge it, Being your lawfull Prince by true succession, I could haue wisht, with all my heart I could, This maiestie had sitten on the browe Of any other: so much do I affect a priuate life, To spend my daies in contemplation. But since that heauen and you will haue it so, I take the crowne as meekely at your handes, As free and pure from an ambitious thought, As any new borne babe. Thus must thou Richard Seeme as a Saint to men in outward shew, aside Beeing a verie diuell in thy heart: Thus must thou couer all thy villanies, And keepe them close from ouerlookers eyes. Buck. My Soueraigne by the generall consent Of all the Lords and commons of the lande, I tender to your royall maiestie, This Princely Ladie, the Ladie Anne of Warwicke, Iudged the onely worthiest of your loue. To be your highnesse bride, faire Englands Queene, Rich. My royall Princely Cosin Buckingham, I see you striue to blesse mee more and more, Your bountie is so large and ample to mee, You ouerflow my spirits with your great loue, I willingly accept this vertuous Princesse, And crowne her Angell beautie with my loue. Lo. Then as the hand of your high parliament, I giue her here vnto your maiestie. Rich. Lord Louell I as heartily receiue her, Welcome faire Queene. C. And from the Lords and commons of your land, I giue the free and voluntarie oath, Of their allegeance to your maiestie, As to their soueraigne and liege Lord and Ladie, Richard the third, and beauteous Anne his Queene, The true and lawfull King and Queene of England. Rich. I doo accept it Catesby, and returne, Exchange of mutuall and partie loue. Now Fogge too, that in your traiterous Libels, Besides the counterfeiting of our hand and seale For Rufford, though so great a fault deserude To suffer death, as hee alreadie hath, Going about to slubber our renowne, And wound vs with reproach and infamie, Yet Fogge that thou thy selfe maist plainely see, How farre I am from seeking sharpe reuenge, Fogge I forgiue thee, and withall wee doo, Repeale our heauie sentence gainst Shoares wife, Restoring all her goods for wee intend, With all the world now to bee perfect friendes. Cat. Why my good Lord, you know shees dead alreadie. R. True Cates. else I nere had spoke such words, aside. Alas I see our kindnesse comes too late, For Catesby telles mee shee is dead alreadie. Cat. I my good Lord, so is her husband too. Ri. Would they had liude to see our friendly change, But Catesby say, where dide Shoare and his wife? Cat. Where Ayre was hangde for giuing her releefe, There both of them round circkling his cold graue, And arme in arme departed from this life: The people for the loue they beare to her, And her kind husband, pittying his wrongs, For euer after meane to call the ditch, Shoares Ditch, as in the memorie of them, Their bodies in the Friers minorites, Are in one graue enterred all togither, But mistris Blague for ingratitude, To mistresse Shoare, lies dead vnburied, And no one will affoord her buriall. Rich. But mistris Blague shee shall haue buriall too, UUhat now wee must bee friendes, indeede wee must, And now my Lords, I giue you all to knowe, In memorie of our eternall loue, I do ordaine an order of the Bathe, Twelue knights in number of that royall sort, Which order with all princely ceremonies, Shall be obserued in all royall pompe, As Edwards our forefather of the Garter, UUhich feast our selfe, and our beloued Queene, UUill presently solemnize in our person. Buck. Now am I bold to put your grace in minde Of my long suite, and partly your owne promise, The Earle of Herefords lands. Ric. Cosin weele better thinke on that hereafter. Buck. My paines my Lord hath not deserude delay. Ric. UUill you appoynt our time? then yee shall stay, For this hote hastinesse sir you shall stay, Mooue vs no more you were best. Buckingham. I Richard, is it come to this? In my first suite of all, dost thou denie mee? Breake thine owne word, and turne me off so slightly, Richard thou hadst as good haue damnde thy soule, As basely thus to deale with Buckingham: Richard ile sit vpon thy crumped shoulder: I faith I will, if heauen will giue me leaue, And Harry Richmond, this hand alone, Shall fetch thee home, and seate thee in his throne. Exit. Rich. What is he gone in heate, why farewell he, He is displeasde, let him be pleasde againe, We haue no time to thinke on angrie men: Come my sweet Queene, let vs go solemnize, Our Knighthoods order in most royall wise. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
