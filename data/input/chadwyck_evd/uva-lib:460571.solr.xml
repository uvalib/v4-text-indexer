      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. âAlfonso's Tent. Alfonso and Claudia. Alf. Were the time still more urgent, I would pause. League with a man so worthless, as Albanio? I think, I know Fontano's humour better! Join with a man, who wars against his country? The mere suspicion is a flagrant wrong! Clau. Infatuated man! Alf. (Impatiently.) I've known him long! Were he intent upon a royal crown, Would he consult Albanio for his means? No!âhe would choose an instrument more noble, To build the structure of his fortune with. Clau. A bad intent requires a worthless agent! Alf. He's had an army at command so long; Has raised so many from a low estate; Conferr'd so many favors on his friends; That tools, like these, in such advent'rous cause, With threats, and promises, and dubious words, He'd model to his desp'rate purpose.âNo!â âAnd where's your proof?âIn your accusations, I learn not that, which most would prove the fact, That he has tamper'd with my body-guard. Clau. He has been tampering with thy body-guard. I wish Manfredi were but here to prove it! He tells me, he has letters in possession, Which place the fact beyond the power of doubt; Letters, that bear Fontano's sign and seal! Alf. Letters, that bear Fontano's sign and seal? Fontano's letters?âLet me see them. Clau. Why? Shouldst thou see them, some wild insidious doubt, Some feeble thought will raise some weak resolve, Till doubts, and weak resolves, will end in ruin. Alf. This language seems too strong for truth. Clau. âAh!âno! Thou know'st, he has so strong an empire o'er thee, Thou wilt not trust the evidence of sight!â âBut in the struggle for pre-eminence, Thou'lt be the first to feel, though last to see.â Stayâthere's Manfredi.âHow the idiot creeps! Markâhow he starts, and falters in his walk! He sees the danger, and his mind's disturb'd. Enter Manfredi. Alf. Signor Manfredi!âI'm but ill prepared To bear a treason from Fontano.âWhere? Where is thy proof, in evidence of guilt? Manf. My liege!âThis paper will command conviction. (Gives the letter.) Alf. (reads.) It bears his sign:âThere is no truth in man! I loathe my nature!â'Tis Fontano's hand! Clau. (aside.) The poison operates! Manf. (in answer, aside.) Hush!âTo think is dangerous!â Alf. (reads.) âTo Signor Ursino, Captain of the Guard.âI received thy letter by the messenger. 'Tis well!âI thank thee, for thy continued offers of service. These offers I will repay, not with thanks only, but with substantial rewards.ââ(About to tear the letter.) Clau. âRead the whole!â The evidence is yet to come.â Alf. Enough!â I've read enough to prove Fontano's guilt! âYes!â'tis his hand:âit is the traitor's hand! (Reads.) âAll that depends on me is ready. Albanio, too, informs me, that his troops are well prepared. âThe king totters!âand I am on the rack of impatience.âMeet me to-morrow, at St. Michael's.â âThine faithfully, but impatiently, Fontano.â And I am all impatience, my good Signor, To give thy treachery its deserved reward! But tell me, Signor, by what happy chance, Thou gain'st possession of this paper. Clau. Ah! Let us hear that; thou didst not tell me that.â Manf. I've lately mark'd a strange, mysterious, air, In this good instrument, Ursino.âWhen Doubt and wild daring towards high exploits Combine in one, unequal to the hazard, A mean suspicion is engendered, which Never sits easy on the man, that wears it.â Such did I mark in him; and, therefore, mus'd For many a night, upon Ursino's change. At length, one evening, as returning home, Through the long pillars of St. Michael's aisle, I saw Fontano and Ursino there. I marvell'd much!âFor I had long observed A striking coolness, that accorded ill With such mysterious courtesy and friendship. Alf. It look'd suspicious! Clau. Yes! indeed it did. Manf. At length they rose; and walking slowly on, I heard Fontano whisper to Ursino,â âNo fear there is of that:âI know the room, âIn which Alfonso sleeps!ââOn which they parted. As I returned to where they had been sitting, I found this paper, which Ursino dropt. Alf. Ye gracious powers! I would ye had ordain'd Me some lone shepherd, that amid deep glens, And cloud-capt mountains, watch their bounding flocks! Would I'd been taught to fell the sturdy oak; To till the soil, or prune the purple vine:â Yea!âto learn any thing, however mean, Vile and ignoble:âe'en to watch the goat, Browsing o'er herbage on a snowy heath, Rather than guide the vessel of a state!â Clau. How many a man would wreck the world to do it! Alf. So many humours to consult withal! So many interests to combine and guard! So many factions to control and guide! Clau. A noble science! Alf. Yes!âfor those, whose hearts Long have been steel'd with tempered coats of mail! Clau. (impatiently.) Fontanoâ Alf. Yes! The state demands him: Do with the traitor, as becomes the danger: Yet spare his life.âI once esteem'd and lov'd him: Remember that, when justice pleads for vengeance. (To Claudia.) Nayâdo not speak!âI tell thee, spare his life! [Exit. Manf. Life?âYes!âHis life with pleasure we will spare; Only to curse him with a heavier fate! Clau. Signor Manfredi! Tell me, tell me howâ âHow shall I thank thee, as becomes my state? But what?âwhat more?âOh, speak!âwhy look'st thou thus? Manf. I would advise, that thou attend the king. Let him not weigh the matter too minutely. The hand! the hand! 'tis not Fontano's hand! Therefore, to let him meditate too long Were unsound policy. Clau. Indeed it were. And yet the plot commands a sure success! [Exit. Manf. I hope so too!âAlfonso's mistress!âwell! [Looking after her with contempt. Enter Cavallo. Cav. What?âmusing still, Manfredi? Manf. Thou art welcome! Cav. Signor, I hither came to be so. Man. Wellâ Then thou art doubly welcome to my heart. Cav. I'd ask one question of thee. Manf. Speak, I charge: Yet commune softly. Well: thy question? Cav. Whenceâ Whence has arisen the practised Claudia's hate To wise Fontano? Manf. Woman!âwoman!âAh! Tis well thou'rt made with such materials, or Manfredi ne'er had seen a day like this! Cav. I thought she lov'd him; and would fain have placed Alfonso's crown upon his head. Manf. Away!â He is not far from Venice, who is walking On the Rialto. Times will change, my friend; And so will passions. (whispering.) He refused her love! Cav. Indeed! Manf. Yes!âon the faith of man!âah, more! He did not frown, or seem averse alone; He scorn'd her, Sir, I tell thee:âshe's a woman! And will that sex submit to scorn and insult? âHe's but a fool, who does not know as much. Cav. Now then her conduct, which to me has seem'd So wild, and so mysteriousâ Manf. Is explain'd! Yes! yes! it is so: and my hate, thou know'st, (Without intelligence from me) is bile, Form'd by the opposition, he has raised, To my advancement in Alfonso's court. âThe gentle Claudia has another causeâ Cav. Not more effective than the last? Manf. Her son, (Born of a youthful lover) has been charged With several crimes against the public morals. This youth Fontano has advised the king To supersede in his command; and doom To partial banishment! Cav. And this she wisely Charges Fontano's hate with?â Manf. What so likely? The boy deserv'd his fate, though:âbut, Cavallo, Let us not waste the time thus. Cav. Thou hast gain'd The end and summit of thy hopes at last? Manf. No!âno!âCavallo. Cav. Why what now, good Signor? Is not Fontano fettered to thy wish? Is not thy rival, Angelo, at length Banish'd the city?âwhat then would'st thou more? Manf. These are most true! but these are not enough! I must complete my vengeance. I have done Littleânay nothing; if I do no more Than thisâ Cav. Done nothing? Manf. No!âby this right hand! The deed, which we have planned to execute, This coming night, shall not complete my hope! Claudia would, doubtless, stop at this; but Iâ Hast seen the beauteous Angelina? Cav. No! Manf. (whispering.) The lovely fair one bends beneath my power! I will inflict such vengeance on Fontano; And on his daughterâ Cav. On his daughter? Manf. Yes! Cav. Thou lov'dst her once! Manf. I did so, good Cavallo; Marry and do!â Cav. Then why extend revenge To one thou lov'st?â Manf. Because I hate the father More than I love the daughter. Hatred is The master passion of the two: and can I Ruin his hopes, his happiness, and pride, More than by her dishonour? Cav. Dost thou not Intend to marry Angelina then? Manf. No!âI do not!âBut wherefore trifle thus? Meet me, this evening, near Fontano's prison; The eager Claudia will reward thee well! Cav. (Aside as he goes out.) I loathe already this detested trade! [Exit. Manf. (Looking after him with suspicion.) I fear he is but half a villain yet! Thou hast so often thwarted my designs, Abhorr'd Fontano, that my nature loathes thee. Loathe thee?âAh! worse than I abhor Albanio! This day beyond, you'll see the sun no more! Look at it well, while yet the time remains; For never shalt thou see it set again. No!âneverâneverâshalt thou see it more! This fatal dust I'll throw into thine eyes; And then will lead thee to the neighbouring wood, Poor; blind; deserted;âand accost thee thus:â âGoâwander where thou wilt;âand where thy feet âTread the green sod, oh! may the green sod wither.â [Exit. SCENE II. An Olive Grove, with a ruinous edifice in the background. Enter Angelina, attended by Agnes. Angeli. Heaven sheds its mercy upon those, good Agnes, Who pity the unfortunate.âThen tell me, tell meâ Why to this ruin I am brought?âOh Heaven! My senses are bewilder'd by this mystery. Agnes. I am not hard hearted, Signora Angelina, though I may sometimes appear so:âand one day, perhaps, I may tell you all, I know of the matter; which, heaven knows, is little enough.âAt present, I dare not do any such thing. Angeli. But, my sweet Agnes; yes, thou knowest, there must be Something in this, thou never canst approve! My father gave me to the guardian care Of Signor Paulo; with the strictest charge, To guide me safe to Venice. We had travell'd Scarce five short leagues, when, from the public road, We turn'd into a forest.âThen we journied Through the lone windings of a darksome glen, Re-echoing with hoarse cataracts;âand came, What time the moon was waning in the west, Silent and awe-struck, to this ivied ruin. Tis now five daysâBut do, my sweetest Agnes, Say, why I'm hither brought?âI pray thee, tell me. Agnes. The Signor will come tomorrow, Signora, and then he will tell you himself. Angeli. The Signor?âwhat Signor?âwho is the Signor?âspeak! Is it Albanio?âTell me, who it is. Agnes. I dare not tell you, Signora. The Signor will tell you himself.âHave patience till tomorrow comes.âI pity you, I am sure, from my heart. But I cannot do, what I dare not do.âBut why will you not listen to the warbling of these birds?âI love music, Signora. Do you not love music, too, Signora? Angeli. Oh! (weeping.) Agnes. Her sighs and her tears really do go to my heart, so, that I know not what I shall do.âShe has neither ate, nor drank, these two days! Angeli. Agnes!â Agnes. Signora!â Angeli. Think, my good Agnes, think how hard 'twould be, Were thy dear father suddenly overwhelm'd With dire misfortunes:âIf thy lover rov'd An exile from his native city;âand thyself Taken, like me, unknowing, to this ruinâ Agnes. I am afraid I must tell her!âand yet, if I do, what will become of myself? Angeli. Come, my good Agnes!âLet us to yon garden. There let us sit upon a bank of flowers, Or'neath the scented shade of eglantine, And tell me all thou know'st!âThere's my sweet Agnes. Ah!ânow I love the very name of Agnes. Comeâlet me take thine hand.â Agnes. What shall I do?âThe Signor told me not to say. If I did, he said, I should live to repent it all the days of my life. Angeli. Repent!âOh! no.âThou never canst repent A virtuous deed; Oh! neverânever!âNoâ Not if thou liveâe'en for a thousand years! Come then:âThereâlean thine arm on one, Who fain would love thee as a daughter;âcome!â [Exeunt. Enter Angelo and Propertio.âThe latter with a lute in his hand. Ang. Here let us sit.âI'm weary!âWhat a life An exile leads!â Pro. Nayâbe not melancholy. Manfredi lives a far worse life, than thou.â I would not feel the anguish of his heart, For all the universe.âComeâcheer thee up We are not far from Angelina now. Thereâtake this luteâ Ang. It is no time for music! Pro. Nay, I request theeâ Ang. Music is design'd For happier spirits. [Takes the lute. Ah! the worldâthe world Must needs be cruel, since I loathe my lute. [Tunes a wild flourish. I could not draw one rich, harmonious, note, Were it to gain an empire! [Returns the lute. Pro. I have done!â Ang. Thou art the noblest of the sons of friendship! For often hast thou chear'd my sinking heart, When care has weighed my anxious spirit down. Pro. Nayânay:âIt ill becomes thee to indulge, In such deep draughts of melancholy thought. I well remember, when,âin love with nature,â We've wander'd oft within the forest wide, That screen'd thy father's castle, thou wert wont, For hours, to loiter near the mossy brook, That murmur'd music down the deepening glen.â Fair nature then, in all her wild display, Shot rapture through thy frame.âEach wood, each vale, Each torrent, rushing from high cataracts, Then had their graces and sublimities; but now!â Ang. 'Tis true!âBut when we've mixt with men, and felt The influence of their passions, it excites, In our disgust at them, distaste for Nature. Pro. It seems to have that influence upon you! For e'en yon woods, whose very leaves are sacred, Nor e'en yon mountains, towering up to heaven, Call forth one note of holy admiration. I wonder much!âWhy!âe'en the setting sun, (Sublimest image of eternal glory!) Colours yon clouds with golden tints in vain! Ang. Of late, Propertio, I have drunk too deep, In sorrow's bitter cup!âYon glowing sun Ne'er smiled on one, so lovely and so fair; So fruitful in all virtues of the heart; And so abounding in the gifts of mind, As good Fontano's daughter.â Pro. Lovelier far Than fancy e'er can paint! Ang. âWhere is she now?â Perhaps the victim of Manfredi's love! Oh!âAngelina!âThou art doom'd to ruin!â Thrilling with horror in the midst of shame; Unless kind heaven take pity on thy tears! Pro. And heaven will do so,âor I'm much deceived! Didst thou not say, that, near this woody spot, The ruin stands, in which thy fair-one weeps. Ang. Yes!âIn a ruin hid with ivy:âthere Manfredi purposes her destiny.â Pro. Then let usâ Ang. Meet the hated monster there? I've planned it so! Pro. Then whence this gloomy mood? Ang. Fontano!âOh my friend!âFontano's lot Is yet more melancholy far than mine!â Pro. I've heard the dreadful tale; and, hearing, dropt The tear of tenderest sympathy!âyet sinceâ But what is this?âA ruin!âIs it here? Can it be here, that Angelina dwells? Ang. This is the spot!âOh!âFortune, thou'rt my friend.â Tread lightly!âList!âcome;âlet us to yon wood, And meditate the rescue.âThen thou may'st Return to save Fontano's house from ruin.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Alfonso's Tent. ClaudiaâSola. Clau. Odious Fontano!âhow my heart detests thee! What?âScorn my love?âRefuse a proferr'd crown? Counsel the king to listen to the charge Against my only son?âA charge, which doom'd That son to banishment!âI'll bear no more! [Enter Cavallo. Speak!âSpeak!âCavalloâIs the deed perform'd? Cav. Ne'er shall Fontano see the light again! He lives, but sees not!âYes!âThe deed is done. Would it were undone!âMiserable man! Why?âwhy, assist in such a barbarous deed? Clau. Would it were undone?âNay, my good Cavallo, Would that it could be executed twice! But what said he?âHow bore he all the pain? Did he not weep?âOr bore he all in silence? Cav. As to Fontano's miserable cell, Silent, and anxious of the deed, we mov'd, Manfredi whispered me to move with care; Lest, in our haste, we wak'd him from his rest. For, though in chains, Manfredi fear'd his arm. Clau. The senseless coward!âBut did Fontano shew No signs of misery.âHeav'd he not a sigh? Said he no word?âDid he not curse me?âSpeak!â Cav. He wore an air of manly melancholy! We found him sitting at his prison window, Watching the clouds, that roll'd in volumes round The giant summit of Vesuvius! The moon, at intervals, illumin'd his face; No passion seem'd to move him:âAll was calm, E'en as the scene, on which his eyes were fixt! He heard us not:âBut, ever and anon, Drew deep ton'd murmurs from a trembling lyre.â Clau. Oh! what a tale is this!âA poet's tale! Worthy the pen of Tasso!âWell! what more? Cav. Sometimes he seem'd, as wandering wild in thought; For, now and then, the sounds were wild and sad;â Now he would chaunt the Virgin's evening hymn; At which I trembled, and Manfredi too! Clau. Trembled?âThe bigots!âBut proceed,âproceed. Cav. Seeing him thus absorb'd, Manfredi rush'd, As if he were awaken'd from a trance;â And as Fontano, for the last, last time, Fix'd one sad look upon the scene, which rais'd His thoughts to heaven, full in his visual orbs Scattered the drug, that robb'd his eyes of light! Oh! righteous heaven! I do repent me now Of all I saw!âthat, seeing, I forbore To strike the hand that did it.âGracious heaven: Clau. âRepent thee?âNay, Cavallo, why repent? Thou canst not doubt, but I'll reward thee well! Cav. Not all the wealth, Italian monarchs boast; Nor all the gems, that Indian quarries yield, E'er can reward me.âOh! that I had died E'er, in an hour accursed, I gave consent, Thus, thus, to barter all my hopes of heaven! What, though I were beset with ills around, Steep'd in the gulph of every deep distress, And my lov'd infants famishing with wantâ Clau. They'll want no longer!â Cav. Yes!âa father's fame! Oh!âbetter had they pined, from day to day, Till death had lull'd them to a happier fate; Than that their father should allay their wants In banquets, purchased at a rate so dear! Clau. Cavallo!âwhyâI took thee for a MAN! Nature had stampt a goodly image on thee; Therefore, I say, I took thee for a MAN! This weak, this idle, sense of moral wrong Writes driveller on thy forehead!âBut proceedâ Cav. â'Tis done!âalas!âthe coward act is done! Manfredi did it!âHaving so perform'd, Unpitying,âunrelenting,âand unmoved, He led him to yon precipices; where, Watching the bubbles of a spring, he saw, Eating wild berries for a feast, a Boy, Who smil'd with rapture at the sight of money. Clau. And what ensued? Cav. Manfredi gave a ducat; And whisper'd in the famish'd urchin's ear, That if he wished for fifty ducats more, He'd lead the miserable, sightless man, Up to the margin of a precipice, And leave him there, to wander as he would! Clau. 'Twas well concluded!âAnd ye left him there? Cav. Yes! there we left him.âThus I quit my tale. Would I could lose all memory of it too! Clau. Henceâhence!âthou hero of the ready tear; Hence, to Manfredi!âSend Manfredi hither.â (Aside.) I fain would thank him for Fontano's ruin; [Exit Cavallo. Oh!âit is balsam to my soul indeed!â [Exit. SCENE II. An olive grove.âA ruinous edifice on one side; a bridge over a stream on the other. Enter Manfredi. 'Tis hereâat eveningâAngelina walks, To meditate on absent friends.âI'll make her mine! Foolâthat I wasâto trust so young a boy, To lead her father to a precipice!â Fool!âfool!âunworthy of a high estate! The boy, as every idiot might foresee, Pitied the wretch, because the wretch was blind And leads him on, as I am taught to fear, By secret paths to Venice. There he hopes To meet his daughter.âLittle does he thinkâ Ah!âlittle dreams he, that the friend, he chose, To guide his daughter to the court of Venice, Bribed high by me, convey'd the treasure here. Oh! sightless idiot!âHope deludes thy fancy! Meet thee at Venice?âHail thy hopes at Venice? Yes!âyes!âshe'll meet thee, miserable father, Meet thee, and stun thee, with her sighs and tears, Ruin'd and dishonor'd.âShe appears! Listâlistâshe comes!âHer steps resound with music! [Retires. Enter Angelina, attended by Agnes. Angeli. Ah!âwith what pensive pleasure does the mind Dwell on those moments of delighted youth; When, led by Angelo, through vallies deep, We've culled sweet violets from soft beds of moss, Or snatch'd wild roses from a wilderness Of thorns and briery brakes:âenchanting time! Agnes. Signora!âBless me!âshe is so melancholy, that she will not speak to me.âPoor heart!âshe is not proudâshe is only sad!â (Manfredi comes a little forward, and conceals himself behind one of the trees, not far distant from Angelina. Angeli. Sometimes we've wandered on the rocky shore, To hear the murmur of each curling wave: Sometimes the colours of departing day Have charm'd our footsteps up the mountain side. Till in the east, in silent state, the moon Ting'd every cloud with most bewitching hue; And o'er the shadowy scene such glory cast, That Nature paus'd, and gazed, with silent rapture, On this her fair creation. Manf. (aside.) How each word Sinks to the deep recesses of my soul! Angeli. But why recal those happy moments now?â Agnes. Why do you then?âpresent sorrows, Signora, are always enough for the time. Angeli. Ah, my good Agnes, what thou say'st is true. Oh! my dear father!âHow my sinking heart Bleeds for thy sorrows!âLead me to thy chamber: My eyes feel heavy; and my life a burthen. Agnes. Come then, good Signora;âcome with me. I've made a bed for you, as soft as rose-leaves.âSinging, sleeping, and dreaming, Signora, are the best pastimes of a body's life. Angeli. Yes!âwhen we sing With a pleas'd heart, and sleep with soundest sleep, And dream of those we love.âOh! why didst wake me, So early in the morning?â Agnes. What did you dream about, then, good Signora?âNot about Signor Manfredi?âNo!âno! âIt was not about Signor Manfredi!â Manf. (aside.) Thou haggard serpent!âYes!â Thy withered bones Shall ache with torture all thy life to come. Angeli. Methought, last night, I saw my father's arms Stretched out to save me.â'Twas an airy dream!â Ah Heaven!âI thank thee, that he knows not yet, What woes I've suffered; and what anguish now Wrings his poor daughter's bosom with despair. Agnes. Oh!âdo not weep, Signora,âdo not weep. Alas!âalas!âshe does not hear me.âPoor lady âI pity her from my heart.âOh!âgood heavenâthe Signor!â (Manfredi comes forward. Angeli. Signor Manfredi!âThen I'm lost indeed! Manf. (Points to Agnes to go off.) (Exit Agnes. Not lost, fair ingrate!âBut why drown'd in tears? Is this my only recompence?âOh!âWhy Those looks so haughty?âDid I love thee less, Ill should I brook such dignified returns. Angeli. 'Tis well such conduct meets with such reward! Did'st thou not steal me from the friends, I loved? And at a time, too, when my father,âruinedâ Needed the solace of his daughter most? Was that a moment to distress me more? Oh!âyesâa time, most meet for such design! Manf. Fair Angelina!âsome officious friend Has, with successful malice, wrong'd thine ear. I call the sainted spirits to be witnessâ Ange. Away!âaway!âNo more!âWert thou to call E'en Heaven itself, it would avail thee nought. Manf. By Heaven thou wrong'st me.âNo, my Angelina, I lov'd thy father, though he lov'd not me. I lov'd his virtues;âI admired his zeal: And, if I cou'd have imitated any, His was the model, I'd have copied from. Angeli. Has Heaven no judgments for hypocrisy? Manf. Ah! how thy words do sully thy sweet lips! Nay!âAngelina, doâI charge,âdismiss Doubts of my sacred honour, which ne'er yet, E'en by the venom of a slanderer's tongue, Has once been breath'd on.â Angeli. I'm the slanderer then! Manf. Come my sweet maid.â Angeli. Oh! miracle of meannessâ What?âwould'st thou stoop to take a wife so cold, So loathing, and so hating?âWho, from youth, Has pledged her faith to one, the proudest boast Of all the maids of Italy.âHis name I will not, need not, breatheâ Manf. Insulting maid! Thisâthis is past endurance.â Angeli. Who as much, In all the true nobility of heart, As in his form and manners, does surpass Thee;âas, in turn, thyself eclipsest all, The poets dream of, when they paint a monster. Manf. Why all this anger?âFair, deluded maid! Why all this anger? 'twill avail thee noughtâ Angeli. Signor Manfredi!ârather would I die Ten thousand deaths, than listen to thy prayers. Angelo!âearliest idol of my heart! Manf. Angelo?âYes!âThis goodly Angelo Now pays dear penance for his treachery. And can this youth be Angelina's idol? Theme of her boast, and monarch of her heart? Oh! he would stain it, lady; he would stain itâ Angeli. Thy tongue speaks slander, thou unworthy man! He is all honour; full of noblest thoughts.â E'en now he animates my glowing breast With all his virtues; and inspires my heart With hatred for thy crimes.âCould Angeloâ Manf. Not Angelo, nor Heaven itself, can now Secure thee from my arms.â Angeli. Oh!âHeavenâTo thee I call for my revenge!âThis friendly daggerâ (Takes a dagger from her bosom and prepares to strike, when Manfredi seizes her arm, and snatches it away. Manf. Is weak and powerless in a woman's hand! Thereâget thee henceâthou enemy to loveâ (Throws it away. Fair Angelinaâ Angeli. Vilest wretch!âAway. Enter Angelo. Angeli. This way the noise was.âYes:âThe fiend is here! Turn, son of hell; thy hated visage turn. [Manfredi turns, draws, and rushes upon Angelo. After fighting some time, he retreats upon the bridge, and falls into the stream, that flows beneath. Ang. There, worthless miscreant, buffet with the stream; And let thy Fortune save thee, if she will. [Flies to Angelina, who has fainted. Fair Angelina!â'Tis thy love that calls. Thy father livesâhe journeys on to Venice. Look up, my angel;âyesâthy father livesâ Indeed he lives!âPropertio's gone to Naples, To save the remnants of his shattered fortune. [Takes her in his arms. (Cries of Manfredi heard, as he floats down the stream.) A Woodman passes hastily over the stage. Wood. Bear up, Signor.âI'll bring you to shore, whoever you are. (without.) Take hold of this bough, Signor.âHolloaâholloa!â Ang. The woodman saves him!âSeeâhe drags him to the shore! Look up, my fair:â'tis ruin here to stay. Just Heaven, how cold!âAlas!âshe diesâshe dies! [Carries her into the forest. SCENE III. A distant View of the City of Naples. Enter Fontano and Scipio among Precipices. Sci. Follow my steps, Signor; and we shall soon come to a safer road than this. Oh! 'twas a cruel deed, to rob you of your sight, and then to leave you among these dreadful precipices. Fon. Cruel beyond the cruelty of men. Where art thou, Scipio?âLet me hold thine hand! I fear to step;âthese rocks are wild and steep; Thereâlead thee on:âto thee and heaven I trust! Sci. And heaven shall fail you, Signor, sooner than I will. Fon. Heaven proves its mercy by its gift of thee! Alfonso!âOh Alfonso!âTo be duped By the low craft of Claudia!â'Tis too much! Oh!âhow man's intellect does crouch before The bought endearments of an artful woman! Sci. Whither shall I lead you, Signor? Fon. Lead me to Venice, boy. Lead me safe thither; and my gratitude Shall pay thee well, for thy good conduct towards me. Sci. Venice?âVenice, I suppose, is a long way off, Signor, is it not?âBut we shall one day reach it, nevertheless, I hope. This ducat, which the savage Signor gave me, will take us several leagues. When we have spent it, Signor, have I your leave to exercise my profession? Fon. (smiling.) Profession? And what is that, my noble minded boy? Sci. Why, Signor, you must know, the Virgin and my mother taught me the art of an improvâprovâ proviâ Fon. Improvisatore? Sci. Ah!âthat is the word, Signor!âSo, if I see a rich cavalier, riding on the road, this is the way, I shall begin, perhaps: Stop, Signor, stop; and, if you can, Relieve this poor, ill-fated, man: For he was once devoutly kind, Though now he's indigent and blind. The road is rough;âthe way is long; The arm of malice, wild and strong: Then stop, good Signor, stop, I pray; Let fall a ducat in our way; And heaven, no doubt, will bless your hopes to-day. Fon. Oh! richest mirror of a noble heart! What splendid court contains a soul like thine? Sci. Come, Signor, don't be afraid;âthis is the way: These rocks so high,âthese paths so roughâ Are desert, waste, and wild enough, To strike our hearts with dread: But, let me, Signor, move before: Thereâtake this hand;âand grieve no more: For heaven, from this day forth, will pour Rich blessings on thine head. Fon. To grant me thee, my Scipio, was indeed To grant a treasure, that I ne'er could hope, In this most weary pilgrimage!âProceed. If heaven has but preserved my child, I yet May taste of happiness!â'Tis now sev'n days, Since she and Paulo took the road to Venice. Sci. Then let us take the road to Venice, too, Signor. If a lady can travel to Venice in seven days, surely you and I can go thither in ten. Come, Signor, who is afraid? Fon. Paulo's a manâI would have had a better; But that the time prevented.âHeaven preserve her! Sci. Come, Signor, come along: the road is better now. Fon. Well, my dear boy.âBut we must now be cautious. Albanio's camp, if I mistake not, lies Full towards the west:âso lead me northward, boy. Sci. Albanio? Who is Albanio, Signor? I have heard a great deal of talk about this Signor Albanio; but cannot make out, who he is. Fon. Oh! He is worse, than language e'er can paint! He slew his wife, at midnight; fled the land, Which gave him birth; and wars on all its sons!â Scip. Oh! ! What a monster! (A hunting horn heard at a distance.) Merciful Virgin!âThere are three or four men, flying from rock to rock, yonder, as if they were frantic. For heaven's sake, Signor, let us get out of their way, as fast as we can. (Horn louder.) Oh!âit is a chamois hunt.âAh! now they have killed the poor chamois!âHere they come, Signor; we had better retire: for they may hunt us now, as far as we know.âCome, Signor; we have not a single moment to lose. [Exeunt. Enter Albanio, Spalatro, Carlo, Marco, &amp;c. Albanio comes forward, and leans, for a few moments, in a melancholy attitude against one of the rocks. Alb. It shames my nature, thus to waste the time In the pursuit of animals, while men Are hunting me.âI stand ashamed!âThe worldâ 'Twill laugh to hear it. (relapses into thought.) âIf I draw my sword Thus, and then thus;âthen this way, and then that; What city's walls shall I have outlin'd?âSpeak! Spa. What city's outlines?âWhyâthe walls of Naples. Alb. Ah! thou art right!âAnd hadst thou said the walls Of Babylon, or Nineveh, thou hadst Said rightly too. For e'er the gilded moon Shall wane into a melancholy crescent, Naples shall be a Nineveh! Spa. A Nineveh? Alb. Yes,âa Nineveh, and a Babylon! One stone shall not repose upon another! The future traveller shall search for her, And dust alone shall recompense his search! And we've been hunting here, like boys and clowns, Because a chamois cross'd us on our way! I stand ashamed at such a folly.âMarco, Unbend thy bow;âand thouâand thouâand thou. [They unbend their bows. This bow shall such a folly see again, When children pick it up;âand not before. [Breaking the bow. 'Tis thusâand more than thusâSpalatro?âhere! Hast ever heard?âBut stayâthe sun is up, And this no time for secrets.âNowâbe honestâ I sometimes fear my faculties do wander!â That is, Spalatro, now and then:ânot now:â But when I brood too deeply o'er my sorrows. Hast thou remark'd it?âCome, be honestâspeakâ Speak like a man, that venerates another, Loving the truth. Spa. I ne'er observ'd it, Signor. Alb. Nay nowâthy looks speak truer, than thy words. But I forgive thee.âTruth's an honest fool, That few men love to deal with. (With some hesitation.) Hast thou heard?â Hast ever heard, that I was married? Spa. Yes. Alb. Thou hast? Spa. I've heard it whisper'd, Signorâ Alb. Whisper'd?â Right noble men speak out; they never whisper! Why should men whisper, when they speak the truth? Manfredi is the villain!âWas it heâ Was it not he, that stabb'd my innocent wife? Spa. (In a very indistinct manner.) Oh! horrible! Alb. What?âthink'st thou, then, 'twas I? If thou think thatâ Spa. Most noble Signor, thou mistak'st my meaning. Alb. (His passion subsiding in an instant.) Thine hand!âI'm hastyâbut I'm innocent. Oh, if thou knew mine agony of soul!â Spa. I could not love thee more! All. Nor we. Nor we. Nor we either, Signor. Alb. Bear with my humour!âFriends, I thank ye all. I've sworn eternal hatred to Manfredi! I've sworn eternal hatred unto Naples! And war,âeternal warâ'gainst all her perjur'd sons! And, if ye wish to know the hated cause, Follow my steps, and I will tell it ye. But, ere ye hear my agonizing tale, Swear, by this sword, ye will revenge my causeâ Spa. We swear!â All. We swear! Spa. And may perdition hurl Her deadliest tortures, if we e'er prove false! Alb. Then I am trebly arm'd!âSpalatro, come; Come, my bold comrades;âlet us to our rocks, And meditate the ruin.âNaplesâseeâ Yon distant towers are those of Naples!âweâ We'll pulverize each palace into dust, âSo small,â That e'en a summer's breeze may waft it to the skies!

Manfredi missing?â'Tis a mystery I have no power to solve.âThe king?âhe comes, When I'm but ill prepared to meet him.âList!â Enter Alfonso, Sciolto, and several Officers. Officers retire to the back part of the stage. [Claudia retiring. Alf. Whither, my gentle Claudia, art thou going? I would exchange some words of import with thee. Clau. Ever obedient to thy sacred will! What wouldst thou urge, my lord? Alf. I fear me much, Signor Manfredi has dishonoured us.â Clau. In what?âdishonoured thee?âImpossible! Alf. He came not, at our bidding, to the council; Which I've thought prudent, therefore, to delay. And rumour says, he's no where to be found. This looks suspicious.âWhither is he gone? Clau. It is a question, I'd give worlds to solve! Alf. Ha!âwouldst thou? Clau. Yes!âassuredly I would!â Alf. I know not why thou should'st:âFontano's fate Call'd from thine eye-lid not one pitying tear.â I see no urgent reason, therefore, why Manfredi's should distress thee.âHe's a villain. Clau.

Indeed?âIndeed? Clau. Beware, my liege, the monarch's bitterest foe, Suspicion!â'Tis an enemy, that sitsâ Oh! how ungracefullyâon a manly brow. Dismiss it, Sire, I charge thee.âTis a fiend! We ought not to give credit to vile tales, Against an absent man. [Exit haughtily. Alf. 'Tis nobly said! Oh!âhad I listened to that bosom truth, Ere I had given such credit to Manfredi! Hither,âSciolto!âTo the neighbouring rocks Thou shalt attend us.âThere Fontano travels, Led by a guide.âWe must propose some plan, As thither we are journeying, to establish, Whether or no Cavallo's tale be true.

Ere morrow's night, he meditates, they say, Naples to lay in ruins!âMid yon rocks He sits, when military caution grants, And loads the air, with many a bitter curse, Against the sons of Naples. Alf. Yes;â'tis true. But I'm a foe to fear.âHe 'll dearly pay For bearing arms against his native city. Let us away:âI will not sleep, till I Have proved the worth, or falsehood, of Fontano.

Scene changes, and discovers Albanio, with Spalatro, Carlo, and a select number of his troop, reclining among scattered rocks, in one of the recesses of a vast pile of mountains, capt with snow. A Cave at the farther end of the stage, almost entirely screened by overhanging herbage. Alb. My tale is short.âYe all have heard the chance, That placed Alfonso on the throne of Naples! Troop. We have, we have. Spa. And suffered from it too. Alb. He was elected by the people's voice, To stem the torrent of the lawless power Of factious nobles.âHe deserved the honour! Spa. 'Tis nobly said, since he is now thy foe. Alb. To drown all cause of future jealousies, The king, to win my interest in the state, Gave me consent to marry with his niece; Whom I, in studious secresy, had loved, From the first dawn of youthful manhood.âOh! How my nerves thrill!âThe vile Manfredi, too, Long had the captivating maiden loved! This hated monster, stung with jealous rage, The very midnight of our wedding day, Silently stealing, from th' adjoining closet, (Where, by the treachery of my groom, he lay), And, as in nature's best repose we slept, Murdered my wife!â Spa. Oh, monster!âmonster!â Troop. Horrible!â Alb. O'ercome with terror, in the dread confusion, The assassin fiend escaped my angry arm; And to the astonished world proclaim'd aloud, I did the deed in jealousy of him. Spa. Execrable villain!â Car. Vile, detested fiend! Alb. All Naples rose, in tumults, in the morn. From house to house the monstrous rumour ran; That Iâthat Iâthat I had stabb'd my wife! My friends forsook me:âevery lisping babe Was taught to curse me:âe'en Fontano, too, Believed the tale, and showered invectives on me. The people, from all quarters of the city, Like hungry hornets driven from their nests, Throng'd round my house, demanding my arrest! Spa. And did the miscreants seize upon thee, Signor? Alb. Seize on me?âAye!âand to the prison gates They dragg'd meâhisssing all the odious way. Oh, what a time was that!âThe city shouted, Calling me tiger, monster, and hyena, And dogs were taught to snarl at vile Albanio's name Spa. Did they not try thee, noble Signor? Alb. Yes! Oh, yesâthey tried!âBut justice fled the city. Manfredi pensioned witnesses against me! They swore!âNaples believed!âAlbanio was undone!â To lose my wifeâfameâfortuneâin an hour! Too much it was for human strength!âI'm toldâ And I believe the taleââmy mind is ruined!â [Tears starting into his eyes. Spa. Oh no, Signor, that's only a fancy of your's. Car. Oh, aye, that's all a fancy of your's, noble Signor. Alb. Would I could think so.âYes, my mind is ruined! Spa. Come, noble Signor, do not brood over your injuries now. Tell us the sequel of your history. Alb. Amid these mountains once a hermit lived. His food were berries, and his drink the dews, Distilling from the leaves of olives.âHeâ But stayâmy mind is sailing in the air!â 'Twas not a hermit's history, I was telling:â Where left I off?âHe pensioned witnesses, I say: Naples believed, convicted, and condemned me! Oh, cruel, senseless, idiots!âIn the town One only man was found with heart to pity;â That man my gaoler!âHe believed my tale, Applied the balm of comfort to my breast, Oped wide his gates, and bade me to be free. I fledâand here, amid these mountains wild, A refuge found.âThis, comrades, is my tale. For this I have vow'd vengeance to Manfredi; And, for believing his enormous tale, Have I vow'd hate against the sons of Naples! Spa. And we'll assist thee, in thy just revenge! Troop. (tumultuously.) All!âall!âall! Alb. Then ere the setting of to-morrow's sun, Naples, the credulous, insidious Naples, Prostrate shall lie!âAmid its ruins, weeping, The snow-hair'd sire shall recognize his son, Amongst the heap of dying and the dead; The wife her husband; while her little babe Shall pinch her bleeding breast, in vain, for food! Spa. Then come, my comrades, echo every note, That forms the chorus of our evening song. Alb. First to the banquet!âLet us form the hymn O'er golden goblets. Enter to the feast. Come, my brave brothers, to this coral cave; Screen'd from the sight by many a shady bough. Full many a fathom is it deep.â'Tis here We hold our banquet.âEnter to the feast;â And drink due honour to the safe arrival Of those brave troops, who'll join us on the morrow. [Exeunt into the cave. Enter Fontano and Scipio. Sci. Take care, Signor; mind how you walk: these great stones, and pieces of rock, are enough to throw both of us down.âOh!âI begin to be almost tired. Fon. Let us sit down then, Scipio.âI would not tire thee, for the world. Let us sit down, I say. Sci. So we will, Signor.âHere,âhereâis a clean, mossy place, fit for a lady to sit down upon. [They sit down. Fon. Art thou hungry or thirsty, Scipio?â Sci. N?o; are you thirsty, Signor? Fon. Yes, my little friend, I am thirsty. Sci. So am I, Signor; very thirsty indeed! Fon. I thought thou saidst, thou wert not, Scipio? Sci. Why, I did not mean to confess, that I was thirsty, unless you were so too, Signor; because, if we are ever so thirsty, there is nothing for us to drink. Fon. Thou art the best of all possible comforters, Scipio.âBut let us search about; perhaps we may find a spring, some where bubbling from these mossy rocks. Sci. So we will, Signor.âIt is not impossible.â Among the woods, along the ground Among the rocks we'll look around. Fon. Thou dear little improvisatore! Sci. Perhaps from some lone rock there wells A bubbling spring;âperhaps there dwells Some little nymph of Scipio's age, Who guards the fount, from robber's rage. Ah!âIf I find one, as I go,â I'll kiss the little maiden so! And while she criesââNoânoânoâno;ââ I'll bid her love poor Scipio! [Sci] What a vast number of birds, Signor, there seem to be in this solitude.âI wonder, they should choose to live, where there is not a single soul to listen to their music.âDid you not say, Signor; that the bird, we heard just now, was a nightingale? Fon. Yes; 'twas a nightingale!âsure notes so wild, So tender, and so rich, were never heard In Persia, or in Araby. Sci. List!âlist!â [Nightingale sings. There, there, she flies to yon tall sycamore. Fon. Hark!âHark!âShe breathes her solemn strain again! Sci. Oh!âhow she jugs!â Fon. A pause more sweet, than that, Ne'er lulled the night to ravishment!âAgain? Sci. Oh!âthere she flies!âWhy she flies as fast, Signor, as if she thought, we came to rob her of her brains.âFairies, they say, Signor, live upon the brains of nightingales. Fon. Do they so, my little bird of paradise?â Sci. Yes!âSignor.âAnd not only on the brains of nightingales, but on the purple leaves of violets.â Oh!âIt must be excellent food! Violet leaves and nightingales' brains Are food for gentle fairy; When she whispers amorous strains, To slumbering maids of the dairy. Fon. Thou art so cheerful and engaging, boy, That nightingales will cover thee with leaves; And flowers spring up, in myriads, o'er thy grave, To tell each stranger, as he passes by, That Nature's happiest work lies buried there. Sci. Oh!âthat were charming, if it e'er prove true. Violet leaves and nightingales' brains Are food, &amp;c. &amp;c. [Exeunt. Enter Angelo and Angelina, at the farther end of the stage. Angeli. Ah! dearest Angelo, to thee I owe, More than a life of endless power could pay. How shall I thank thee? How reward thy love? Ang. With thy sweet self! Angeli. An indigent reward! Ang. Richer, by far, than monarchs can bestow. Angeli. But ah!âmy father!âwhither strays my father? Oh!ânever, never, shall I see him more! This way, thou saidst, he travelled:âbut I see No traces of his wandering!âOh! that I could! When first thou sav'd'st me from Manfredi's arms, I gave myself to happiness: ah! then I little thought, how rude the storm had visited My father's sacred head. Oh! dearest loveâ Oh! think, how hard to be deprived of sight, And wandering all alone.â Ang. Hush, my sweet maid, and let me lead thee to The sheltering arch of these impending piles; While I, amid the mazes of the rocks, Seek for a cave to screen thee from the winds. âHere sit thee down; Till I have found, amid these desert wilds, A cave, to shelter thy sweet innocence. (Searches about.) Angeli. How does the music of thy voice compose Each misery to silence! Art thou gone? How shall I cheat the anxious time away, Till thy belov'd return? Oh that I could, Like Orpheus, fam'd of old, with vocal lyre, Charm these rude rocks away!âAngelo! (Calls.) [Her voice reverberates among the mountains. How the rocks echo!âAngelo!âAngelo!â [Echoes. StayâI will follow thee; we'll search together. [Exit. Enter Scipio cautiously. What sounds are these, I wonder?âThese rocks do nothing but echo!âand that, too, with such music, as I never heard before. WhyâI do not see any one! Signor Fontano told me, that echo never speaks, but when some one has spoken to her. But I do not believe, any one spoke to her now; so, I suppose, she has learnt to talk to herself. (Looks about.) Here?âNoâI do not see any one here.âI will return to the Signor again! Ah!ânowâI would give half this ducat, if I could but discover a fountain: I am so thirsty, I know not what I shall do! Fon. (without.) Scipio!âScipio!âwhere art thou, Scipio? Sci. Haâha!âThere is the Signor, I declare. Stop, Signor, I am coming. Come along, Signor! The way is even there: come along: a little more to the right, Signor. [Enter Fontano.] Why, I declare, Signor, you walk very well without a guide! Fon. Thou art an excellent companion, for a melancholy spirit, Scipio. Sci. But the echo, Signor!âDid you ever hear any thing, so beautiful in all your life?âNow,âif I mightâ I would sing you a canzonet, Signor, that you would, perhaps, have no objection to hear again.âThat is, when you are melancholy. Fon. Can'st thou?âThen sing it me, I pray thee. Sci. You must not laugh, Signor.âDon't look at me, Signor. Fon. Alas!âmy boy, I ne'er shall see again! Sci. Oh! I beg your pardon, Signor.âI had really quite forgot, that you were blind!âI am a thoughtless little fellow, Signor, without wit; and, I am sorry to say, without money.âBut I mean no harm, Signor; and so I'll sing you a stanza:âand if you do not like it, I'll never sing you another:âso you will only lose three minutes of time. Fon. Thou mak'st me smile, in spite of all my sorrows! ECHOâCanzonet. Sci. I. From the grot, where Echo lies, At dawn of day, fond Zephyr flies; And, gliding on the rays of morning, With many a dye the clouds adorning; Now he soars, and now he falls; Now on gentle Echo calls; While, from her green recess, the Nymph replies In wildest melodies. [Echoes. Sci. There, Signor,âis not that very pretty? Fon. Beautiful, my little nightingale; and beautifully sung. Sci. NayâSignor,âI did not ask for that.âBut there's only one stanza, Signor:âshall I sing you the other?â Fon. Ah!âmy sweet linnet, twenty if you will. Sci. There is but one more, Signor;âbut that, I think, is the best.âNow then!âI'm almost ashamed, too!â II. Every glen, and mountain round, Repeats the wild, mysterious, sound; And all the scene, both far and near, Delighted lends a listening ear; Till, lost in eddying circles wide, From hill to hill, from side to side, Her hovering voice, in sweet progression dies, In gentlest extasies. [Echoes. Sci. There, Signor.âNever ask me to sing again. âBut what is this?âI surely hear a soundâ Fon. List! list!âLead forward:âDanger travels near.â [Exeunt. Re-enter Angelo and Angelina, at the farther end of the stage. Ang. These rocks seem vocal; yet no human form Appears to animate their solitude. Angeli. A voice We surely heard; and then its echo. Ang. Yes!â Yet here no trace of wandering man is found!â (Sees the cave.) âA cave!â Made to our hopes, and suited to our fortune! Its entrance form'd of coral!âlike those caves, Form'd in the niches of a stormy coast, For nymphs, who, warbling wild seductive notes, Lull the enchanted mariner to sleep. Angeli. Oh! do not enter:âIt perchance contains Adders, or serpents, wolves, or famish'd eagles.â Ang. Fair Angelina, can thy bosom know Such groundless fears as these?âAh!âTell me whenceâ Angeli. Nayâdo not chide me, Angelo:âyet if Fate and misfortune have decreed it so, Chide as thou wilt, but do not venture there. NayâI entreat thee:âOn my knees I beg: Oh! If thou love me, grant this one request!â Ang. My Angelina!âCease these terrors wild. Hemm'd, as we are, on every side, we turnâ Angel. Ah!âbut, my Angelo, it looks so wild;â If there thou go, some hidden power within Will tear thee from me:âIf thou enter there, I ne'er shall see thy form, belov'd, again. Ang. See!âYonder could portends a coming storm. These rocks afford no shelter;ânot a hut Adorns these sterile solitudes with smoke, Curling in peaceful volumes.âSit thee there. Angeli. My dearest Angeloâ Ang. âThe storm begins In yonder valley:âSee!âThe lunar bow [A lunar rainbow. Stretches from side to side.âSome shelter must be found! Angel. Dost thou persist?âThen I will enter too.â Thy fate is mine, whatever it may be. Ang. No!âI entreat.âSit there till I return. [Angelo is about to enter the cave;âbut returns hastily.) We must away!âdestruction lurks within.â [Exeunt. Enter Albanio. Alb. Their merriment disturbs me;âand, indulg'd Too long; will drown, perhaps, their thoughts of vengeance. I'll summon them to rest!â [Blows his bugle.âSpalatro and the troop issue confusedly from the cave. Form into groupes! [They arrange themselves into detached groupes. The banquet over, time, with drowsy wand, Lulls the grey eve, and woos to short repose. Now let each comrade travel to his bed:â These hollow rocks abound in shaggy moss, Equal to beds of down, for Nature's hardy sons. [Troops disperse.âSome climb up the rocks, and repose upon their points; others lie down at their feet. Mine be the station, that commands the bay, O'erlook'd by huge Vesuvius.âBrother!âBrother!â [To Spalatro. Last night I saw strange visions, as I slept. Francisca beckon'd me!âI heard a voice Crying out, âMurder,âââRescue,ââand âRevenge!ââ And then I saw Manfredi torn by serpents: And then I thought, they curl'd along the ground, Until they crept into a yawning cave, And made its hollow womb resound with hisses. Nayâdo not speak:âWe have no prophets now, To tell the meaning of such horrid dreams. Marvelâbut doubt not.âPolydore!âgood night: Good night, my comrades; sleep ye well till morn. [The troops murmur affectionate applause, as Albanio retires, accompanied by Spalatro and a part of the band. END OF ACT III.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A wilderness, lying between the camp of Alfonso and the rocks of Albanio. Fontano and Scipio asleep, by the side of a waterfall. Enter Angelo and Angelina. Angeli. Oh! what a sad and awful night is this? There seems no limit to our dangers: list! Listâhow soft music swells upon the gale! Now all is silence.âHark! It swells again: Rising and falling with the buoyant wind. Ang. I've heard it long. Albanio's troop I fear! We must away; or ruin will o'ertake us! Angeli. Whither, oh! whither shall we fly?âagain? (Sounds approach.) Ah!âdearest Angeloâsure heaven deserts us! Ang. Lean on this arm, thou persecuted maid; While life remains, no power shall force thee from me. Angeli. Let, let us fly. I dare delay no longer. [Exeunt. Sci. (waking.) Signor! Signor! I heard music, Signor. I heard it in my sleep. (Wakes Fontano. Fon. What means all this, my Scipio? Sci. I am sure, I do not know, Signor: but I will step out, if you please, and see if I can discover where, and what it is. (After looking about some time, he runs hastily to Fontano.) Oh! Signor! Signor! I see a whole army of soldiers coming this way. Fon. An army of soldiers, Scipio? Sci. Yes, Signor, a whole army of soldiers. (Music.) Enter Alfonso, Claudia, Sciolto, and an Officer. Alf. Remain ye there! At present come no further. Clau. What do we here, my most illustrious Lord? Alf. Retire thee, Claudia, to yon spreading olive. Nayânayâno questions:âI will soon be with thee. Follow this Signor: 'tis the hour of danger: Guard her with hero's care.âFarewellâfarewell. Clau. (Aside.) 'Tis most mysterious!âBut my will obeys. [Exit with Officer. Alf. This way he travelled; but we meet him not. (They search about.) Sci. (After peeping out, in a whisper to Fontano.) Here are two rich cavaliers, Signor: let me beg some money of them; for our stock is very low, and Venice is a long, long, way off. (Scipio goes out, and pulls off his hat to Sciolto.) I'm hungry, thirsty, cold, and poor, Obliged to beg from door to door; No cot have I to lay my head, Nor mother's care to give me bread. Mid hail and rain, in frost and snow, The sport of all the winds that blow, Forlorn I rove, from day to day, Along this rough and rugged way: Oh! Signors, do bestow upon Affliction's poor deserted son, One little gift to help him on. Sciol. Thou art a most eloquent little beggar, whoever thou art, and I am inclined to give thee a ducat for thine eloquence; but thou must, first of all, tell me, whether thou hast seen a blind gentleman travelling this way? Sci. A blind gentleman? Have you any business with him, Signor? Sciol. What matters it to thee, whether I have business with him or not? Sci. Scipio has as much right to ask that question, as you have to ask, whether he has seen a blind gentleman travelling this way? Alf. One would think, thou wert born in England, thou free-thinker and free-speaker! Well, then, we have business with him;âand there is a ducat for thine information. Sci. (refusing the money.) Is your business with him good or bad, Signor? For I would not tell you, if I thought, you meant him any harm. Alf. Thou art the noblest beggar, that I ever saw; and as thou confer'st nobility on thy profession, I will tell thee:âour business is good. Sci. (to Sciolto.) Is that true, Signor? Sciol. True as the moon. Sci. True as the moon!âAh!âbut the moon, they say, wanders about all the year round, and is constant to nothing. Alf. True, then, as thine own honesty! Sci. That's sworn like a true and gallant Signor. Now I know, you will not deceive me: but, first of all, tell me his name. Sciol. Signor Fontano. Fon. (coming forward.) Who seeks Fontano? Alf. (to Sciolto.) This is most fortunate! What a calm dignity his visage wears! (To Fontano.) And art thou here, thou great and injured man? This is far better, than my hopes had whisper'd, E'en to my fancy. (To Sciolto.) Now I'll try him!âMark! Claudia and stern Manfredi swear, he's guilty. Cavallo whispers, he is innocent. Observe! If he prove guilty:âwhyâhis treacherous head Is not a ducat's worth.â(To Fontano.)âMost noble Signor! I pay thee all the homage of a friend. Fon. To whom, oh Signor, am I thus indebted, For this unsought, unmerited, respect? Alf. Albanio. Fon. Who?âAlbanio?âHe who vows Eternal hatred to his native city? Alf. The same. Sciol. (to Alfonso.) He answers, as if innocent. Alf. That may be artifice.âMy noble Signor! Thine injuries demand revenge!âRevenge! Give me thy sanction and assistance then: March with my troops:âthine honourable name Alone would raise an army in my cause. Fon. Rather than do so, I would lingering die, Ah!âinch by inch!âChain'd to a pointed rock, The hungry vulture, or the famished eagle, Should tear my entrails.âWhat?âEternal shame! Conspire against my country? Alf. 'Gainst thy country? Has not thy country thrown thee from its bosom? Fon. It has, it has!âYet must I love it still! My country?âYes, while one declining stone Lies tottering on another; while thy fields Blush with their purple vineyards; and thy rocks Elevate their spires to heaven: oh, use meâ Use me as thou wilt; cover me with wrongs; Tear me with taunts;âmake me a monument Of public scorn, and I will love thee still! And, as I beg from door to door, call down The choicest gifts of bounteous heaven upon thee! Sciol. Has not Manfredi robb'd thine eyes of light? Fon. He hasâhe has! Alf. Did not thy sovereign, too, Consent to that most horrible transaction? Fon. (mournfully.) He didâhe did!â Alf. And wilt thou not revenge? Sciol. And did not Claudiaâ Dost thou know?âThy daughterâ Fon. My daughter?âWhat?âWhat of my daughter?âspeakâ Alf. And canst thou not have heard it then? Fon. Oh, speakâ Tell meâoh, quickly tell meâof my daughter! Speak, gracious SignorâI intreat thee speak! Alf. (aside.) Oh, miracle of honour!âhow thy virtue Wrings my sad bosom, for my conduct towards thee! Fon. If thou hast mercy, Signor!â [Alfonso turns aside to conceal his emotion. Sciol. Miserable man! Whilst thou wert lingering in thy loathsome cell, Returning thanks, most grateful thanks, to heaven, It still had left thee in thy miseries, One treasure yet, of value more than all, Dear to thine heart;âthe base, the vile, Manfredi Devised the means to rob thee of the treasure. Fon. (kneeling.) O, thou eternal Father of the world, Upon whose mercy I've relied so long;â Whose matchless power, the earth, the air, the skies, The universe demonstrate; and whose justice, Though long delay'd, is ne'er delay'd in vain; To thee I call for mercy in the present, And justice in the future!âThy dread works I dare not scan;âthy dispensations I will not, dare not, question!âWeak and humbled, Let not my words offend thee!âOh, my father!â [Appears lost in silent agony Sci. SignorâSignor!âSignor!â Fon. What wouldst thou, child? Sci. Would, that we could lie down among these rocks, Signor, and close our eyes for ever!âOh, I could weep, Signor; but if I wept, you perhaps would weep too, and that would break my heart. [Hides his face in Fontano's robe. Fon. My dearest boy, I thank thee for this pity. Alf. Oh, wretch! to wound the noble man so much. Could I speak comfort in this hour of woeâ Fon. I cannot, ought not, to be comforted! My daughter!âOh, my child!âThine injuries Complete my awful measure of affliction. Fortune can do no more!âI once had hopeâ Now I despairâHeaven seems to have forsa'en me! Sci. (weeping.) My mother has often told me, Signor, that Heaven never entirely forsakes the good. Fon. Oh, my sweet boy!âI pray thee, Signor, leave me. Here will I dieâI will no longer hope, Nor struggle with my destiny. [Sinks down on the edge of a rock. Alf. Oh, Signor!â Fon. Leave me, oh leave me; add not to my griefs, By bearing witness to my miseries. Alf. Signor FontanoâI would whisper comfortâ Fon. Who speaks of comfort to a man like me? Banish'd my countryâby my sovereign wrong'dâ Who speaks of comfort?âAm I not traduced?â My house dishonour'dâand my daughter ruin'd? Alf. Wilt thou not hear me, Signor? I am come To supplicate thy pardon. Fon. (impatiently.) I'll not hear! âAnd yet, Albanio, I must tell thee, that, In this thy war against thy native country, Thou dost offend both God and man!âThe power, That rules the destinies of men and kingdoms, Visits that crime more heavily than murder.â Quit, then, thy course of ruin!âI can love None, who forsake their country;âand admire None, who presume her errors to revenge. No!âwhen our country loves us not, return Grief for her hate; but let no arm be raised, Against the blind injustice of her will. Who loves his passions better than his country, Deserves full measure of his country's hate! Alf. Heaven!âWhat a noble patriot have I ruin'd! Sciol. Signor Fontanoâ'tis thy king that speaks. Alf. I come, Fontano, to entreat thy pardon. Tell me, thou noble and much injured man, Canst thou forgive? Fon. My king?âIt is a dream! My fancy wanders, and my ears deceive me! Alf. Oh, no, Fontanoâ'tis thy sovereign bends. These tears respect: forgive me, if thou canst! Fon. Thrice honour'd master!âdearly valued friend!â I've loved thee ever with an ardent zeal: I know thy nature:âthou hast been deceived. Let us, then, lose all memory of the past From this sweet hour. Alf. I clasp thee to my heart Fon. But I am guilty of a crime to feel One ray of joy, while yet my daughter lives, And does not live for me. Alf. She does!âShe does!â She lives for thee, and all the world beside; Fair as the spring, and pure as driven snow. Rescued, by Angelo, from lawless power Of unchaste love, among these rocks she strays, (As penitent Cavallo tells me), led Led by the hand of Angelo; whom you, And I, and all th'admiring world, shall love. Fon. Ye gracious powers!âOh!âthis is joy indeed!â Oh!âcould I press to this long-aching heart, My lovely Angelina. Alf. (To the Guards). To the camp Of stern Albanio, now direct your course. Fon. Oh! seek my daughter!âShould Albanio's troops Behold her wandering, all is lost for ever. Oh!âseek my daughterâspare a father's tears! Alf. Thy tears are mine!â(To Guards.)âAnd as ye march along, Let every eye be watchful. He, who first Espies the noble wanderers, shall receive A rich reward from me. Fon. And what is moreâ A father's grateful thanks!âOh! let us fly: A father's haste would far outstrip the wind! Alf. Yet ere we go, I would fair Claudia see. (To Sciolto.) She journey'd with us: lead us to the shade, Beneath which she reposes. Come, Fontano, Lean on this armâ Fon. I have a father's fears Albanio's troopsâ Alf. Anticipate no ill. Heaven bears its character for justice still! Sci. (Chagrined at Fontano's taking the arm of Alfonso.) Nay!âlet me lead thee, Signor, pray:â Each sylph, and sylphid,âfairy,âfay, Or, by what name soe'er ye call The nymphs, who guard this waterfall; Proclaim, that, whether strait or wide The path meanders,âI'm thy guide! And, though thy king desires to see; Thy guide has been, and still must be, To lead thee, where thou want'st to go, The wildâbut faithfulâScipio. (Takes Fontano's hand, and insists upon leading him.) Fon. Excellent boy!âThe world has not thy peer! [Exeunt. Enter Manfredi (cautiously) from behind. Curst be the hour, I e'er beheld the sun And curst the hour, that gave my mother birth! May the earth open; may the mountains fall; And crush Fontano, and Albanio, too, In one deep wreck of ruin.â What have these eyes beheld? Fontano clasp'd, Firm in the king's embrace! Curst be the man, Who saw me floating in my watery bed, Dragg'd me to shore, and took me to his hut, Reared on the craggy margin of the torrent.â Vile, senseless, fool! I hate thee for thy pains. What shall I do?âAnd whither shall I fly? Outcast of nature! StayâAlbanio's camp Lies at the feet of yon gigantic mountains. âThe thought is masterly;â I'll ruin him again! And on his ruin Exalt myself. [Drawing some keys and a dagger from under his robe. These keysâthis daggerâoh! It is a paradise of thought! Disguise Thy face and figure, too, Manfredi.âYes! 'tis done. Some berries, and a bending frame, shall screen Albanio's enemy. I breathe again! And dare thee, Fortune, to thy utmost hate. [Exit. SCENE II. Albanio, sitting in a meditative posture. Part of his army lying asleep, in detached groupes, around him. He comes forward and sits upon a jutting crag. Alb. Music has lulled these iron hearts to rest! But mine shall never more be soothed to sleep, Till yon proud city smokes beneath its ruins.â Again!âit pleases, though it soothes me not;âagain! [Music:âsoon after interrupted by vivid flashes of lightning:âMusic continues till the lightning is followed by a violent thunder storm. The angry storm subsides at last!â Full many a year, upon this rocky coast, I've watched the warring elements; while these, More happy far than me, lie lock'd in sleep; But ne'er, till now, have I been greeted with Such dismal wailings, as these rocks sublime, This night have echo'd from their secret caves. Oh! I could wish to see this piteous world Crumble to atoms!âAnd the hideous noise Of its crude elements would charm my ear, Like softest music, which, I've oft times heard, Lulls the sad soul of anguish to repose.â [Music resumes. In what deep silence wave yon clouds of jet. Mark, how the moon-beams gild their shadowy skirts: [The dark clouds glide gradually away; the moon shines brilliantly; and the whole of Mount Vesuvius is seen towering in the perspective. How glorious!âLo!âVesuvius appears!â Itself a planet.âTowering o'er the vale, It gives new grandeur to sublimity.â Magnificent!âOh Nature!âHow thy works Dissolve my soul in holiest admiration!â [Loud peals of thunder. Roll on, ye heralds of omnipotence;â Roll to the utmost limit of the spheres. And you, ye lightnings, guide me on my way To yon proud towers.âBut spare the time-worn walls: Rob not my soul of vengeance:â'tis mine own. Ah! Can ye sleep my comrades?âWell; sleep on. Would I could sleep as well!âThe thunder roars Harsh music to harsh bosoms; but to meâ It breathes soft, melancholy, music.âOh!â There was a timeâHow wild the volumes roll! Echoing from one deep valley to another:â Now dying in faint murmurs.âHush'd the scene! So dies each tumult of an injured spirit; When hope has charm'd each passion into peace. âMine ne'er will rest, till death has closed the scene! [Relapses into melancholy. Angelo, supporting Angelina, appears on one of the cliffs above. Alb. What's this I see, on yonder cliff?âa youth! Bearing a fainting woman in his arms. Carlo!âSpalatro!âPolydore!âawake!â How can ye sleep amid this warring uproar? [The troops start up, and fly to their arms. Spal. Who's there?âwhat danger?â Car. Signorâdidst thou call?â Alb. See ye not yonder fine-form'd maid, that leans, Weak and exhausted, on her lover's breast?â Car. Good heaven!âwhy run we not to succour them?â [Carlo, and several of the troop, climb to the spot; and, after some difficulty, succeed in leading Angelo and Angelina down the precipice. âAngelo comes forward, Angelina clinging to his robe. Ang. Fortune has cast me in so many dangers, Most noble chief, that I would well consent, No more to buffet her tumultuous stream; Did I not feel, for this affrighted maid, More pangs, than death has power to bestow. Alb. (Aside) âA noble pair!âand worthy of each other. Ang. If thou hast ever felt the bitter pang Of ill requited service;âever seen A faithful friend, that every secret knew, Which prisoned in thine heart, accused, disgraced, Cast in a dungeon;âfrom that dungeon freed, Only to wander into banishment, An unknown outcastâ Alb. (Aside with great emotion.) Thou hast touched the chord!â And yet I fear, that he was born in Naples! Ang. âBut ah!â If love hath ever fired thy manly breast, And innocence has answered thine entreaty, With the soft rapture of requiting love; With heart,âall beating,âthy benignant hand Will stretch, with pleasure, to assist this Angel. Alb. Guard them, ye Powers!âMy conscience sinks within me.â Ang. O'erwhelm'd by fortune,âtrembling under pangs Of home remembered, friends, and parents too; Fainting with hunger; sinking with fatigue; We ask thee nothing, but a little food, To quell our hunger; and the meanest bed To rest our weary frames.âOh!âdo not tremble! Lean on this arm, my Angelina.âSignor! This maid is fainting with fatigue:âI charge thee, Shew her thy pity.â Alb. (To Angelina.) âFairest maid, this youth Speaks to the heart.âBut I forget my oath! (To Angelo.) âAs thou dost value life, and what is more, This maid's possession,âanswer me with truth. âArt thou from Naples?â(A pause.) (Aside.) I do entreat, that he may answer âNo.â StayâI'll not ask him:âNo!âI will not ask him! âThou'rt born in FlorenceâyesâI know thou wert!â I saw thee there some eighteen months agoâ Ang. In Florence?âNo!âIn Naples I was born. Alb. Ye powers!âI fear'd as much!âNow for my oath! I wish I had not sworn! âI wish I had not sworn!â (After a pause.) âDost know Albanio? Ang. He, who on the night Of sacred marriage, massacred his wife? Who fled?âwho wars upon his native city? I know his name too well!â Alb. Ye sons of darkness!â Heard ye not that?âHe strikes the chord of madness. No pity now shall lull me into mercy.â Carlo!âSpalatro!âBind this youth of Naples; Bind him with bonds, and seer his flowing locksâ Angeli. Oh chief! I do entreat thee to forbear. What has he done?âWhat uttered to offend? What he has said, I pledge a virgin's word, Is sacred truth.âOutcasts, indeed, we are: Fall'n from as high estate, as fortune grants To any lord in Naples.âTell me, then, What he has done, that draws this sudden flash Of wildest anger, from thy threatening eye? Alb. Did he not say, that he was born in Naples? A state, that I've resolved, on oath, to ruin; And every son, that comes within my power! Ang. Unnatural fiend!âOh, worse than leopard born! Alb. (to Angelina.) Did he not say, Albanio fled his country? Murdered his wife?âHe said itâyes, he said it!â Deny ye that?âSaid he not that?â Ang. Albanio? Alb. Yes!âAlbanioâFUGITIVE and MURDERER! I am Albanio; and I love the name; Though I abhor the practice of your charge. Bear, bear him hence, ye pausing idle crew: Take him and hurl him from yon pointed brow, That peaked summit, called âAlbanio's Rock!â Hurl him to the dolphinsâhurl himâhurl him down Angeli. Oh, on my bended kneesâ Alb. Avauntâavaunt! No, no!âthey neither heard, nor pitied, me! None, born in Naples, therefore, shall receive One ray of hope from me. Ang. I've heard of tigers, Lions, and panthersâbut I never yet Read of a monster, who did hate the land, Which gave him birth, with such a hate as thine!â Alb. I care not what thou'st read.âAlbanio is Albanio's self:âlet that suffice for Naples! Damn'd and insidious race,âhow I abhor ye! Holding me guilty of a crime, so foul, As wed a wife, and stab her to the heart, Deserves that famine, pestilence, and war Should visit ye for ages. Ang. (to Angelina, pointing to heaven.) âLook, upward, angel! Mid yon bright globes our consolation rests! Angeli. They shall not part us!âWe will die together. Alb. (impatiently.) Takeâtake him hence, and hurl him on the strand; While hated Naples bleeds at every pore Angeli. Oh, do not tear him from these eyes away! I ne'er can bear so sad a separation. Take meâtake meâbut let that youth still live: I'd bear ten thousand tortures for his sake. [As they prepare to lead Angelo off the stage, Angelina endeavours to follow, but is prevented. Ang. (to troop.) Awayâaway!âOne last embrace, my love!â Alb. Begone!â(aside.) Or this rough bosom may relent. Angeli. Oh, let me follow.âMonsters, let me go!â Look at himâseeâah, how can ye refuse The grand expression of those speaking eyes? Oh, good AlbanioâI intreat thy mercy;â Let me but follow, and I'll bless thy name, E'en in the hour of death!â [He turns from her with an air of softened dignity. Ang. Farewellâfarewellâ [They tear him away. Angeli. Off, off, ye miscreants:âdo not hold me thus! AngeloâAngelo!âmy dearest Angelo!â [Faints. Alb. (to troop.) Leave me, oh leave me.âSend Marcella hither. [Troops exeunt. [Albanio brings Angelina to the front of the stage, and holds her upon his knee. He bends over her, and becomes softened by her beauty. Alb. How fair, how lovely!âIn all nature's works, A form, more lovely, never met my sight. She almost tempts me to forego my hate; But I have sworn, and will not be subdued.â [Pauses, and looks at her with emotion, Has beauty, then, the power to charm me still? Fortune!âThou hast, for many a weary year, Singled me out to be thine instrument; On which to play thy melancholy airs; And used me, as a discord, to complete The cruel concord of thy varying notes. Tell me, then, jilt, is this sweet, blooming, creature, Cast in my way to smooth these rugged brows, So wrinkled by my sorrows; and to soothe The harsher features of my gloomy soul? NoâI disdain thy boon!âFrancisca lives!â Lives in my heart!âher sainted spirit lives In regions pure. Who sent her there?â'Twas I!â YesâNaples swears it was Albanio sent her;â Stabb'd with a poignard!âOh, revenge, revenge! The time is coming;ânay, the time is come. Enter Marcella and Carlo. Take this fair maid;âand use thy best design, To calm the anguish of her wounded breast.â Soothe her torn heartâI war not with a woman. Mar. Come, my sweet innocent, I will not harm thee! Car. (in an under tone.) Poor lady!âE'en this savage bosom feels To witness thy distress. [Exeunt, bearing Angelina. Alb. Awayâaway: Say, Naples, how my vengeance can display Proofs of envenomed hate, more full than this? The youth is noble, and the maid is lovely; Both form'd in Nature's most exalted mood. The nobler, and more lovely, be the victims; The better, firmer, ranker, my revenge. âRevenge is virtue!ââIs it?âNo, ye're false, Who cry, âRevenge is virtue!ââBut my oathâ My oath doth make me war against my reason. And yetâ(in a sudden paroxysm.) Oh, the vile race of miscreants!âYesâ Have they not warr'd?âThey've warr'd on me for years. He says, I've sent my innocent wife to heaven!â Oh! that the father of yon boundless deep Would change his figure to a towering cliff, Round which the waves and winds might tyrannize for ages. [Exit. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. A Forest. Claudia, reclining under an Olive Tree, attended by several Officers. She comes forward, meditating. Clau. Why I was left in this wild forest thus, I cannot yet divine. Alfonso told me, He came to watch the motions of Albanio, Strange mode of watching! Ah! I fear, I fear, More is design'd, than suited him to say. Manfredi, too! I'd give the world to see him. What says his letter?âThou mysterious slave! âA Woodman saved me from drowning. I have seen what has ruined me.â Seen what has ruined thee? There's much in this. âAlbanio's camp shall be my court for awhile.â Albanio's camp? Why sure the man is mad! âAlbanio's camp shall be my court for awhile. âIn which if I succeedâ.â (Flourish.) (Puts up the letter hastily.) What's this? The king! I tremble at my shadow. Enter Alfonso, Sciolto, and a multitude of Officers. Fontano and Scipio remain in the back ground. Clau. My lord! I joy to see thee thus return'd! Fontano's treacheryâbut why frowning thus? NayâI entreat thee. Why, alas! thine eye So wildly rolls on Claudiaâhad she done Some monstrous crime, oh! never couldst thou look More wildly or more frightfully.âExplain.â (The King remains silent: Sciolto and Officers observe Claudia with anxious attention.) My lords!âcan you expound this mystery? What have I done to merit these wild frowns? Alf. Thou hast dissolved, thou traitress, all the ties, Which bound me to thee! On this spot I vow, Never to hold communion with thee more. Nayâspeak not; I'll not listen to thy tongue. Cavallo told me all. I cameâI provedâ And found Fontano honest as the day. Clau. Alfonso, hear! In spite of all this rant, I will be heard. 'Tis true! What thou hast heard Is to the letter true! And as the crime Is of a nature, that it mocks compare, I will not stoop t'extenuate. Do thy worst. Alf. Unhappy Claudia! I blush for thee, With mingled blushes of reproach and shame. Within a convent's consecrated walls, Perchance, thy soul may learn the sacred hope, Which penitence can give. Sciolto! Sciol. Lord! Alf. I charge thee with the ministry of this. Deep in a valleyânear the rocky base Of yon proud eminenceâa convent stands, Bosom'd in wood. I charge thee to convey This guilty lady to its cloistered walls. Clau. (Impatiently.) I am most ready, Signor, to attend thee. Move on! Since fate ordains it, I submit; E'en with a willing conscience. Lead the way. Alf. Claudia, alas! I cannot quit thee thus, And yet refuse to grant thee my forgiveness. Would that heaven's pardon were as easy won! Clau. And does thine anger, then, subside so soon? Why is thy face so calm? Thy words so mild? I like them not. Recall, and give me harsher! Pour down those epithets, that suit me more: These words unnerve me, for they wound my pride; They wound me every way. Oh! curse me! curse me!â Alf. No! much as thou hast wrong'd me, I'll not wound Thy guilty feelings more. I can but feel, That once I lov'd thee with a lover's weakness; And that though fall'n, degraded, as thou art, I feel degraded too! So fareâtheeâwell! (Sciolto goes up to Claudia.) Clau. (in an under tone.) Whither, Sciolto, whither would'st thou lead me? I'm going a journey, Signor, whither thou One day wilt journey too. Now lead the way. I'm not without a friendâa faithful friend, And which, ere long, shall hide me from myself! [Exit with Sciolto. Alf. Farewellâwith that farewell, would I could lose All memory of thee! (A shriek without.) What wild shriek was that? ScioltoâClaudia? Re-enter Sciolto bearing Claudia. Sciol. She's done a deed, I have no power to tell: Look on this hand, still grasping firm the dagger. Alf. What hast thou done, unhappy Claudia?âAh!â Did I not tell thee, I forgave thee all? Why dost thou, therefore, tempt th' Eternal thus, And render every hope of his forgiveness, Still more remote and difficult to gain? Clau. Oh!âI have sinned beyond the wish of life; Beyond the hope of pardon!âOh Alfonso! On the dark margin of eternity, I feel myself a coward. Almighty Father! Thy mercy is most infinite indeed, If thou canst pardon such a wretch as I. Alf. Oh! lay thine head upon this pitying breast. Clau. Hide me, oh! hide me:â'twas Fontano's voice. Where is thy daughter? She is ruin'dâyes! Manfredi ruin'd her, and I her father. Manfredi?âViper!âViper!âViper!âWhat, Cavallo too?âBegone!âOh save meâsave me. (Dies in the arms of Sciolto.) Alf. Why have I liv'd to such an hour as this? So rich in wealth, in power, in dignity, To be thus indigent in happiness, Is much, too much, for this sad breast to bear! (Cavallo comes slowly from behind; and, after gazing some little time on Claudia, bursts into tears.) Cav. How could I wrong my children and myself, In such a cause as this? Did I not owe A heavier debt, than I can ever pay, To them, to injured justice, and to heaven, I'd not survive thee!âOh! my dearest babesâ How will ye meet the cruel eyes of scorn, With which the world will visit ye?â [Exit. Alf. (To Sciolto.) Bear her to Naples; give a tear to weakness: And on her fate be all for ever silent. (Attendants exeunt with Claudia.) Fontano and Scipio come forward. Fon. My liege! Alf. I thank thee for this sympathy. Ahâgood Fontanoâ'tis a just decree, That disappointment, misery, and pain, Should breathe infection over lawless passion. Fon. Ah!âwhat a lesson does this scene convey! (Scipio, seeing Alfonso give way to strong emotion, goes up to him. Sci. Nayâdo not sigh, my sovereign lord! My master says, that every word, And every sigh, unjustly given, Are entered in the book of heaven. And oft I've heard my mother say, The time will comeâoh! blissful day!â When sighs and tears are wip'd away. Then do not weep. Let Claudia die; She was not worth a single sigh! âBut there is oneâ In yonder wild and rocky grove, The maiden and her lover rove. Oh!âdo my sovereign lord, impart Some comfort to my master's heart! He ne'er can sleep, till they are found: Then let us search the woods around: Come! Let us search each dale and hill; I, too, can never sleep, until My noble master's heart is still. Alf. Surely this earth has never yet beheld A being like thee! Fon. 'Tis my guardian angel! Sci. But look, Signor. Who is that, coming hither so fast, that he seems, as if he were ready to fall at every step? Enter Carlo, breathless. Carlo. The king! the king! which is the king, Alfonso? Alf. I am the king!âThine errand, Signor?âspeak it. Carlo. Angelo!âAngelina!âThey will die!â Albanio, he has seized them! they will dieâ I can no more. Fon. Oh, gracious heaven, receive me! [Falls into the arms of Alfonso and Sciolto. Sci. Oh, my poor master!âOh, my dearest master. [Weeping. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Albanio's Rock. Troops in the back ground. Albanio walking, to and fro, in great agitation. Alb. The world is all my enemy!â Untouch'd, unsullied, I was once a Man: Not in the form and symmetry alone, But in the heart.âI once could breathe a sigh, E'en at the touch of music;âpress the hand Of proffer'd friendship;âgive a toy to children; Join in their sports, and coin a smile at will. But this curs'd charge has turn'd me to a tiger, Without a tiger's reasoning!âI could loveâ And yet I hate mankind. Oh, if the world Would shed one tear of pity for my fate,â Yes! I could love it still.âBut ah, vile thought! âBut winds are weary of my imprecations! Is all prepared?â Spa. The youth with bonds is bound. Enter Polydore, leading in Manfredi, in disguise. Spa. What, ho!âWho art thou? Manf. Lead me to thy chief. (Aside) He cannot recognize this tarnished face, And bending frame.â'Tis twenty years agoâ Alb. (walking up to him, with a haughty air.) Whence didst thou come, and whither wouldst thou travel?â What is thine errand?âArt thou friend or foe? Manf. A friend. Alb. Whence? Manf. From Naples. Alb. Ah?âA friend from Naples? Jewels from serpents! doves from leopards' dens! Honey from spiders!âYet a friend thou may'st be:â The age of miracles has long since passed: But it may come again: and thou, perhaps, the prophet. Thy name? Manf. Marcello. Alb. 'Tis a noble name! Thine errand? Manf. Naples is thine own. Alb. How?âWhat?âAll Naples?â Manf. Bends beneath thy frown. Alb. (blows his bugle; the troops form themselves into a semicircle, from one side of the stage to the other.) Friends, comrades, brothers! here's a noble chief, Sprung from the loins o great Marcello, come, To give a limit to our labours. Speak!â Manf. All Naples and her sonsâ Alb. Speakâspeak ye loud, That all my friends may hear.âI pray you listen. Manf. I've paved the way: Lord Angelo is banish'd: Fontano's eyes are withered; and Alfonsoâ Alb. What of the king? Manf. He dies by this right hand, If 'tis Albanio's will. Alb. And what of Naples? Manf. Naples too shall fall. Alb. Oh, thou'rt a spirit of great power indeed! Naples shall fall:âBut what the instruments? Manf. Myselfâthese treasures,âYes, the city falls Alb. (with an air of piercing investigation.) By force or treachery? Manf. Which Albanio wills. These are the keys of Naples. [Placing them in Albanio's hand. Alb. Well,âI have them! Now for Alfonso. Manf. Here's a poisoned daggerâ Alb. Whose is 't? Manf. 'Tis mine. Alb. And what thy rich reward, For these important services? Manf. Fontano Now scorns my power; Cavallo has betrayed me; Fontano's daughter has been rescued, E'en at a time, I thought possession sure.â Alb. (impatiently.) The priceâthe price? Manf. Fontano's head: The head of Angelo: The gift of Lady Angelina's person. Alb. Fontano's head? The head of Angelo? The gift of Lady Angelina's person?â âYes! I hate yeâ E'en to the child unborn, ye sons of Naples! Hate ye to my heart's core! My comrades, mark! These are the keys of that detested city, Whose charge against me, ye remember well. âIf Naples is to fall, it shall not fall by me, If fraud must be the instrument. The dagger! (In a half whisper.)Where is the dagger? (Manfredi gives it him.) Poisoned?âWell! now mark! Amid the hated sons of hated Naples, One stands pre-eminentâhis name, Manfredi. 'Tis twenty years since I have seen him; and his visage Is grown so bloated with the gifts of fortune, That now I should not know him. To Manfredi, When thou dost traverse the vast fields of hell, Arm within arm, I charge thee bear this message. Tell him, that though I hated him, when living, As lambs hate wolves, my eager hate to Naples, Far, far, exceeded all my hate to him. He knows me pure; Naples believes me guilty. Tell him, that though I hated both, as hell, I hated traitors more. Thy lips are traitor's lips! Manf. (drawing a dagger, secretly, from under his robe.) 'Tis well I steep'd two daggers in the poison! My plan, then, suits thee not?âReturn my dagger, And give me back my keys. Alb. âImpudent slave! Return a poison'd dagger to a fiend, Who has presum'd to take me for a brother?â Did I not scorn to touch a thing, so mean, So abject, and unutterably vile, I wouldâ [Turning from him with contempt. Manf. (aside.) I slew thy wifeâand now I'll ruin thee! My heart has loath'd thee from that hour, accurs'd, In which thy wife first froze me with a look Of silent scorn;âthen gave her charms to thee. Give me, Albanio, give me back my dagger. Alb. Daggers to traitors! Am I wanting here? [Putting his finger on his forehead. I hate thee, reptile, for thine insolence. Manf. It is mine own; I claim it as mine own. [Albanio waves his hand as a negative. Manfredi softly approaches him, and is about to stab him in the back; when Albanio turns suddenly upon him, wrests the dagger, and stabs him to the heart. Manf. May earthquakes swallow thee!â Alb. Now let the poison travel through thy veins, Palsy thy nerves, and melt into thy marrow!â Manf. FiendâFiend of fortune! thou hast slain Manfredi! Alb. (Looking at him, as if he distrusted his own evidence.) No!âI'll not trust the evidence of sight!â Manfredi?â'tis impossible!âthe fiend At Naples is.âAnd yet that lowering eye, Arch'd with malignant wrinkles, never can Deform another face than his.âIt isâit isâ [With savage ecstasy. It is Manfredi;â'tis Manfredi's self!â Troop. Manfredi? Alb. Yes!âManfredi!â Now may yon sky rain daggers if it will.â Spal. Leave him to us, Signor, leave him to us.â [Manfredi falls.â Alb. See! how the poison operates upon him! Die, traitor, die; and take thy flight to hell.â Look down, Francisca, I've reveng'd thy cause. Now for mine own!âThe hated youth shall die, Since he believes me guilty like the rest. Murder my wife?âMy soul! my soul! my soul! Ha! what a vile, detested, miscreant, race, To credit such a tale!âBear out the fiend; And let his limbs so poison all the air, That wolves and kites may die, while gorging on his body. [They bear out the body of Manfredi. (To Spalatro, in a half whisper.)âWhat think ye now? Dost think my mind diseas'd? Spal. He, that thinks that, deserves the name for folly.â Alb. Ye mighty powers!â Why hast thou humbled thus my towering pride? What? Have ye made me, only to be victim To the vile craft of such a fiend as this?â A wretch so low, that, wearing human form, Makes me to loathe the figure of a man. Oh! Fortune!âarrogant and insolent!â This is too much.âBut I'll revenge my cause: And turn this insult on the towers of Naples. (He walks about in a disordered manner.â Troops are seen leading Angelo to the edge of a rock, and stand prepared to hurl him into the sea.) Soldier. All is now ready, Signor. Poly. Signor!â Spal. Peace!âHe's disorder'd.âSee ye how he smiles? I never saw him smile e'en once before! Signor, the youth of Naples is before you! Alb. (Starting.) Where? Ang. (With a loud voice.) Here!â Alb. Godlike in form, but demon in thy speech! Demon! to charge me with Francisca's murder. (To Spalatro.) Charg'd he not so?âTruth blushes 'mid thy frowns.â He did! He did! He is Manfredi's brother. Angeli. (Without.) Where is Albanio?âtell me where he is! Ang. Eternal Heav'n!âI feel a thousand pangs In every moment, I'm allow'd to live!â [Angelina rushes in, in a wild and distracted manner. Angeli. Where is Albanio?âIs Albanio here? (Seeing Albanio she stops, and assumes an air of dignity.) And canst thou, dreadful minister of wrath, Dar'st thou thus tamper with the lives of men? Hast thou no dread of that avenging spirit, That on the whirlwind of the frozen North, Rides through the welkin of this lower world, And hurls destruction on the tyrant's head?â Alb. No!âI have not. I fear no powers of earth, Nor powers of air.âI scorn them all, but one: And she has strung these sinews for REVENGE.â Begone!ânor tempt me farther; lest thy pride Brings on thy ruin too.âBegone!âBegone! Francisca's spirit loudly cries âRevenge!â Spal. Lady!âPermit me;âyonder is Marcella.â Angeli. Signor! Stand off.âI am no woman now. Wrongs have unsexed me. Hear thou MAN OF BLOOD! Hear, whilst you may! And let these purple veins Glut, if you will, the measure of your thirst: But spare that noble victim, lest the might Of some avenging God should seal thy ruin. Alb. Ruin? Away!âRuin and I are brothers. Hurl him, ye frantic idiots, to the shore. Why do ye pause? I charge ye, hurl him down. Would all the sons of Naples too were here, That ye might hurl them to one common grave; The grave of hatred, vengeance, and despair. Then I could die, with ectasy, to-morrow! Angeli. Stayâstay yon hands! I charge ye pause to hear. Heaven ne'er will spare you, if ye spare not him. Forbearâforbear.âAlbanio! dost thou know, That yonder youth is Nature's noblest son? âShouldst' thou wound him!â The great Eternal will avenge his cause, And heap more woes, and ruin on thine head, Than ever fell to one man's lot before! Alb. Sure 'tis some spirit, that appals me thus! A voice from heaven!âI have oft times heard, That injured virtue has the power to call An angel's spirit, from the gates of heaven. Angeli. Let not thy passions tempt thee on to ruin! This hourâthis fatal hourâalone is thine: The next may lead thee to eternity: And, in that dread eternity, what woes, What woes unheardâunthought ofâmay assail thee. Alb. Lady!âAn oath most solemn is, and sacred. I would not break one for an Indian mine, Teeming with emeralds and sapphires.â Angeli. âAh! But Heaven, I'm sure, would pardon such an act: Since, now to do it, constitutes a virtue.â Alb. Did he not say, that I had stabb'd my Wife? Could he stab thee?âcould he, at midnight hour, Have struck the bosom, that he rested on, And turn its snow to crimson?âOut!âThe charge Is second only to the deed itself.â Angeli. Is the charge false?âI've heard it from my childhood.â Alb. Just Heaven! she drives me frantic:âIs it true? Look on this hand! see'st blood upon it?âSpeak. When a man stabs, this is the fatal hand, With which he does the deed.âSee ye ought there? Ang. 'Tis white as snow! Alb. I charge thee, look again.â Not all the waters of the Atlantic waste Could e'er have wash'd the bloody stains away, Although the waves of all the northern sea Should flow for ages through thy guilty hands, Yet the sanguinolent stain would extant be. Marston. Insatiate Countess. Had it but once been sullied with this deed. âBut what?âwhat wild and sacred vision's this? An angel minist'ring!âFrancisca's form! Listâhow rich music floats amid the spheres:â Angel of love!âI kneel to hear thine errand. (Kneels.) So soon to leave me!âOh!âthou martyr'd angel! Seeâhow she floats upon the balmy air; (rises.) Rising to heaven, mid pyramids of rubies!â Angeli. Oh! let thy wife speak volumes, then, for me.â Spare himâoh! spare himâ Alb. Polydore!âMy soulâ My soul seems starting to a new existence. Angeli. May he then live? Alb. Oh! what is life to me? Yes! he may live, for ages, if he will: And so may all that breathe;âso that Albanio dies! Angeli. Oh! heavenâI thank thee.âAngeloâmy love!â Thou'rt free!âthou liv'st!âI fly to loose thy chains. [Flies to Angelo's rock. (A confused noise of distant trumpets, and a clang of arms.) Alb. What means this clang of arms? [Appears, for a short time, as if stupified; then suddenly resumes all his energy. âTo arms!âto arms!â Unsheath your swords, and shew, that ye are men!â It is our enemy from Naples.âCharge!â He has surpriz'd us in our secret haunts. To arms!âto arms!âIt is Albanio calls ye! [Enter Alfonso and Sciolto, at the head of the Neapolitan troops.âA battle ensues.âAlbanio throws himself into the thickest of the battle; but receiving a wound, and finding himself unable to make head against the assailants, he rushes forward, and throws his sword at the feet of Alfonso.âSilence immediately ensues. Alb. Alfonso, thou hast conquered! Firm is thine arm, most prudent thy resolves, And all thy plans matur'd.âI've hurl'd my swordâ To save my Comrades' blood! Hundreds must yield To well appointed Thousands! [After struggling with his pride, some little time, he adds in a subdued manner; I would ask One favour of thee, e'er I pay the price Of misdirected vengeance. Alf. Speak! Alb. My comradesâ I won them from thee!âLet the penalty Rest then on me.âRestore them to their country. Alf. (After a pause.) The boon is granted. Alb. I return thee thanks. Now then my life wanes swiftly to its close.â Oh! What a dream of horror have I past!â My mind has long been withering!âBut I feel, I feel,âalas!âtoo late,âthat I have sinn'd, Beyond the common measure of a crime, To let mine anger take a range so wide. But if I've sinn'dâThou, also, hast transgress'd: Witness the wise Fontano!âsince Angeli. (Rushing from behind). My father! Tell me, oh tell me, where my father travels.â Fon. (coming from the opposite side of the stage.) Oh heaven! I die with gratitude and joy. It is my daughter. 'Tis my daughter's voice! Ang. Can this be possible? Angeli. Ye mighty powers! It is,âit is,âit is, indeed, my father! [Falls into Fontano's arms. Font. My daughter! daughter! oh! my dearest daughter! Alb. Fontano?âAngelo?âFontano's daughter?â Oh!âWhat a crime have I escaped! my mindâ My eyes seem clouded:âAnd my heart is broken!â (Suddenly pulls off his military dress: a tattered robe appears beneath.) Know ye this robe? Alas!âye know it not. It is the robe in which I fled from Naples. Ye men of Naplesâye've accused me long Of murder;âfoulest murder,âof my wife! [To Angelina in a frantic whisper. Yes! of my wife!âmy martyr'd angel wife! That is the charge, that has unmann'd me; stay! Was not that cruel chargeâoh! ladyâlady, Pity my ruin'd intellect.âThe moonâ Seeâhow she rides triumphant;âlike the fair, The gentle angel, that Albanio loves.â Nayâdo not shrink, as if I were a monster! I will not, cannot, harm thee! All believe me guilty!â Yesâthey believe me guilty even now! Fiend of the soul!âthy rage seems fell and endless.â See! see! againâmy angel! yes! the dagger Still rends thy heart, and reddens all thy bosom. [Retreating towards the rock. Away! let no one interrupt meâhenceâaway! Death is to me a paradise!âaway!â [Arrived at the precipice. If INNOCENT to Heaven!âIf GUILTY down to Hell. I hear thee, Martyr!âYesâI comeâI come! Now for life's masterpiece! [Stabs himself, and falls from the precipice into the SEA beneath. THE END.</field>
