      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. A Persian Antichamber (with expansive folding doors) brilliantly decorated, &amp;c. Selima discovered before an Easel, having nearly finished a drawing, her two Sisters, Zorayda and Elmira, observing herâthey come forward. DUETâZORAYDA AND ELMIRA. [1.] From love, and all the fond alarms, Which, 'tis said, its Power imparts, We are free; the nobler charms Of sparkling Wealth enchant our hearts! Sister, there, awhile may tarry, She's too young, poor thing to marry! 2. Fortune, with a golden shower, Has enrich'd our Sire's domains, Link'd to Grandeur, Pomp and Power, Double influence Wealth attains: Sister, there awhile may tarry, She's too young, poor thing to marry! Enter Ismael and Osmyn, two young Emirs, most splendidly arrayedâthey throw themselves at the feet of the Sisters, who, admiring the riches of their attire, &amp;c. gladly receive their vows and protestations âthey suddenly behold Selima, whom they had overlooked on their first entrance, and appearing struck with her superior charms, the Sisters become jealous, and angrily command her to departâshe diffidently curtsies, and retiresâthe Sisters preventing the Emirs following, by singing to them: âSister, there, awhile must tarryâ âShe's too young, poor thing, to marry!â After her departure they cast their eyes with admiration on the drawingâthe Sisters, ready to burst with indignation, stamp, and order a Slave to convey the Easel offâhe obeysâand Scander Zade, their Father, entering, the Sisters introduce their Loversâhe receives them with approbation, and waving a wand, which is brought him by another Slave, as a signal, the folding doors are thrown open, and discover a splendid PERSIAN PAVILION, Guests, Dancers, &amp;c. richly habited. The Emirs, charmed with the splendour of the Palace, and riches of it's possessor, solicit the hands of the Sisters, to which their Father consents, and they seat themselves in lovefraught dalliance near themâduring this Selima re-enters, steps forward, and curtsies with great affability to them, her Father and the Guests, and fascinates the group (her Sisters excepted) with An APPROPRIATE PAS SEUL; which finished, bowing to her Father, she disappears âCymballo comes forward, gazing, in admiration, after his mistress. DANCING SONGâCYMBALLO. [1.] Missee, she be fair as de day, Ching hi! chickettee ho! Trippee so light, as de gossamer gay! Ching a ching, tymballo! She be so kind, dat me no can forbear, Happy de moorish Boy! To prattle of Missee, 'till drop a big tear, Mild as de rain, when de sun he shine clear; Dancee like mad for joy! Ching hi! chickettee ho! Ting a ring, ching a ching, Tymballo! Dancee like mad for joy! 2. Massa, he, be very good man, Ching hi! chickettee ho! He do all de kindness he can, Ching a ching! tymballo! He my Friend when dey sell a poor me Slavee, de moorish Boy! Takee me home, me no Prisoner be! Like a de English, he make a me free, Dancee like mad for joy! Ching hi, &amp;c. 3. Missee Sisters, be very grand Pair, Ching hi! chickettee ho! No for de poor or de beggar man care, Ching a ching, tymballo! Beggar man wish (he no malice oh la!) So wishee de moorish Boy, Missee sisters, both married, huzza! Palanquin'd home by two tree-tail'd bashaw, Dancee like mad for joy! Ching hi, &amp;c. Exit. A GRAND DANCE TAKES PLACE. All the Characters appear highly delighted with the attention of their Host, and the Lovers more than ever attached to the Sisters; a bugle horn is suddenly sounded withoutâall startâa Messenger, pale and breathless, rushes on, displaying the following scroll: âA dreadful Storm has wrecked your Ships, and destroyed your Fortune.â The whole groupe, as if struck by talismanic power, almost instantly (as it were) vanish, leaving the Messenger in the centreâthe two Sisters, the Merchant, Selima, and Cymballo (who had entered at the sound of the bugle,) as if planet struck, gazing on the scroll âthe Sisters burst into tearsâthe Merchant looks heart-broken up to HeavenâSelima and Cymballo endeavour to console himâthe Cloud King, disguised as a Cadi, with Law Officers, enters, to take possession of the Palace; Scander surrenders him the Keys, &amp;c. and stamping, a groupe of Slaves appear, who bow to him; he commands them to transfer their services to the Cadi, now their masterâthey leave Scander with tears, gloomily saluting their new Lord, who rudely draws over Cymballo with them, who exclaims, RECITATIVEâCYMBALLO. No, me be free!âand while my free blood flow, Me spill last drop, to serve him made me so! Falls at his master's feet, who raises himâSelima sends him for her drawingsâduring which, Cadi tells the Sisters, they must prepare to departâCymballo re-enters, the drawing consists of a small neat Cottage, to which she solicits them to retireâher Sisters burst into tears. GLEEâZORAYDA, ELMIRA, AND CYMBALLO. When poverty enters, how quick love departs; Chick a chow! well-a-day! chick a chow, chow! Friends it makes cool, e'en to ice chills their hearts; Chick a chow! well-a-day! chick a chow, chow! Chick a chow! well-a-day! joy was in view! Chick a chow! well-a-day! false friends adieu. Exeunt. Selima attempts to followâthe Cadi detains and makes love to her, she treats him with disdainâ he, continuing his attention, pursues her off. RECITATIVEâPRINCIPAL ATTENDANT. Didst thou but know, sweet Maid, the magic power, Of him who wooes thee with so fierce a love; His perseveranceâthou wou'd'st curse the hour, That first thine envied Charms he did approve! AIR Altered from M.G. Lewis, Esq. vide Tales of Wonder, vol. 1, p. 70. One morning as borne on the wings of the blast, The Cloud King o'er Bagdad directed his flight; A glance o'er the Palace of Scander he cast, And on Selima gaz'd, with enraptured delight. Like a Mortal he wooed her, swore long she had been The dream of his night, long the thought of his day; But no hope greets his heart that it's idoliz'd Queen Will ever with passion, his passion repay. Re-enter the Cadi, much irritated; intimates he is again refused, and, seeming to recollect himself, strikes the Scene, when the portrait of a handsome Prince, splendidly habited, appears, from beneath which he draws the following scroll: âPrince Azor, the Cloud King's Rival.â He then, vowing revenge, strikes the opposite pannel, and a painting appears resembling the Prince transformed to a Beast, from under which he draws the following scroll: âAzor, metamorphosed by the Cloud King's Power; from which Form the Love of Selima can alone restore him.â RECITATIVE ATTENDANT. Then rest secure, a Form like that, abhorred, Can ne'er of Beauty's love become the Lord. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. Interior of a neat Turkish CottageâLattice Windows looking into a GardenâHearth laid for lighting a FireâCoffee Pot near the Hearth;â small Cupboard, in which is Fruit, &amp;c.âa Spinning Wheel, small Table, Stools, &amp;c. N.B. A Musical Instrument hanging up. Enter Hassan Alhabal, an old Gardener, much fatigued, with a Spade. RECITATIVEâHASSAN. Phew! how the Sun melts one! we of Adam's trade, Like Lambkins and young Lovers, court the shade! Ah! love! love! love! when once it taketh root, Bitter or sweet, who can foretell the Fruit! When I was young!âbut my Love dates are pass'dâ A wither'd FigâI'm out of date at last! Yet my kind master's Rosebudâdear! oh dear! Her sunny smiles, Hassan's old frame can cheer! (Coming forward he seems suddenly to limp.) Alla! what's that?âsomething my foot has torn? I talk'd of Roses! and in pops a thorn! (Taking one out of his old slipper.) Quite through and through!âwell, well, I must declare, Like me, these slippers are the worse for wear! They're no great things!âyet, Hassan, thou can'st brag, that They're somewhat better, than Abou's of Bagdad! COMIC SONGâHASSAN ALHABAL. [1.] Old Abou Casem of Bagdad city, As great a Miser as ever saved pelf, For years a pair wore of dirty old Slippers, A hundred years older than he was himself! One morn he tramp'd to a bath, where young Muley The Cadi was bathing, so snug and so neat, So Casem slipp'd his moroccos on coolly, And left his old slippers for Muley's young feet! Oh the slippers! the crazy old slippers, The slippers of Casem of Bagdad. 2. Muley, enrag'd at the swindling deceiver, Made the old Miser pay dear for his pet, Who vexed, the old slippers threw plump in the river, Where soon they were caught in a Fisherman's net: âCurse them!â says he, they belong to old Casem, Smack through his cock-loft he made them rebound: Abou beheld them, again sent to teize him, And soon the old slippers he slipp'd under ground: Oh the slippers, the crazy old slippers, The slippers of Casem of Bagdad. 3. His motions were watch'd by an ill-natur'd neighbour, Who âof wealth he had hid,â told the angry Cadi: So Casem for treasure, compell'd was to labour, Tho' nought but the cobbled old slippers found he: For them he again was a tax made to pay, Sir, Away harum scarum again they were thrown; A pretty Sultana was tripping that way, Sir, And, curse the old slippers, they knocked her down: Oh the slippers, the crazy old slippers, The slippers of Casem of Bagdad. 4. Again Casem's purse for his slippers fault paying, Their wicked old Soles he blasphem'd o'er and o'er, Then in the grand aqueduct threw them, thus saying, âOh Mahomet! grant I may ne'er see them more!â Its pipes they plugg'd up, all for water were gasping, The cause once found out, Casem shook at the news; The Cadi condemn'd him to choak fresh and fasting, And for his old slippers to die in his shoes: Oh the slippers, the crazy old slippers, The slippers of Casem of Bagdad. Exit. A noise is heard at the door of the Cottage, and Hassan re-enters, followed by Selima and her Sisters dressed in rustic habits. RECITATIVEâHASSAN. The Holy Prophet! 'sbud, what shall I say, Welcome, all welcome as the flowers in May! Pleasing's each Lilly, that the Valley decks, To an old Evergreen, who loves the Sex! What a parterre! one, two, three sprigs of Posies. (The haughty Sister passes him last, and slaps his face) Umph! there are nettles tho', as well as Roses! Puts on his spectaclesâenter Scander, in a very plain habit, melancholy, but resignedâthe old Gardener gazes on him, then at the Sisters. RECITATIVE continued. What do I see? dear Master!âthis mean dress! Your Daughters too!âwhat plung'd in deep distress! Aye, Honesty i'n't always well requited! Flowers in their Bud, Ships in their Voyage are blighted. (Scander orders him to retire.) I'm going SirâI'm goneâdon'tâpray don't frown? (Stumbling.) Curse the old slippers! they'd near thrown me down! Exit. Selima welcomes her Father and Sisters to the Cottage, places seats for themâwhich her Sisters in great dudgeon acceptâpresents Scander the old Gardener's spade, intimating he may occasionally amuse himself in the Garden; and, taking books out of a little work bag she had brought with her, tells him, when tired with labour he may shorten the time by reading, &amp;c.âtakes down the Musical Instrument, which she gives to one of her Sisters to chear them, placing the Spinning Wheel before the otherâthis she accomplishes in the most delicate manner, concluding with taking on herself the character of their servantâthe Merchant tenderly embraces her, and retiresâboth Sisters appear very pettish âthe one sometimes thrumming the instrument, then throwing it away in disgustâthe other violently spinning and breaking the thread, then hurling the wheel awayâtaking up the book, throwing it down, &amp;c.âin the mean time Selima strikes a light, kindles a fire, boils the Coffee, and taking dates, biscuits, dried figgs, &amp;c. from her work-bag, beckons her Father, through the lattice, out of the Garden, and presents them all with refreshment âScander seems delighted with her resignation, and appears to thank Heaven for having given him so affectionate a Childâone of her Sisters much agitated throws down the coffee cup, and, bursting into tears, rushes offâScander and Selima kindly following her âZorayda proudly bridles up, &amp;c. RECITATIVEâZORAYDA. Sister's a fool to weep!âIâIâdo'n't mindâ I can sit here and spinâI'm so resign'd! Lord I'm not hurtâwhate'er folks may suppose! 'Twas hard to lose one's House tho', and fine cloaths! One's Husband too!âbut I don't careâI swear it! Ne'er to be married!âoh!âI cannot bear it! Bursts into tears and rushes off.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. Flower Garden, in which a variety of Flowers, interspersed with Fruits, &amp;c. analagous to the climate, are fancifully arranged. A handsome Arbour prominent in the Scene, in which the Sisters are discovered gloomily seatedâ the Merchant supposed to be at the bottom of the Garden, obscured from the sight of the Audience by appropriate foliage, &amp;c.âthe Old Gardener appears presenting a selected bouquet to Selima. RECITATIVEâHASSAN. An humble offeringâgather'd in a triceâ Celestial Houri of our Paradise! Of TulipsâLilliesâWall-flowersâwe have hosts! But you're the only Rose our Garden boasts! Enter Cymballo with a scroll in his hand rolled up, dancing in great glee, and SINGING. Fortune sometimes grows tired of ill-nature, Where be noble Massa? ah! where him be found? Fortune she changee her form and her feature, And turnee, turn, turn, as her wheel it goes round! RECITATIVEâCYMBALLO. Dear me! where Massa? la! me be so glad! Lady, where Massa! me good news have found! Dance, Hassan, dance your old long leggs like mad! And turnee, turnee, turnee, as de wheel him go round! As Cymballo opens the scroll, the Merchant, &amp;c. comes forwardâhis daughters rushing from the Arbour, to obtain a sight; it contains the following intelligence: âA rich Argosy, supposed lost, is safe arrived.â The Merchant and Selima fervently thank Heaven âCymballo and the old Gardener dance about wild with joyâand Zorayda and Elmira resume their former hauteurâMuleteers whips are heard without. RECITATIVE. Cymballo. De Horse and Moole be saddled, Massaâhorsewhips crackâ Soon we de Forest joyful will explore! Oh! Mahomet! what treasure we'll bring back! Smile Missee, smile Massa, be rich once more! Zorayda. Rich! then adieuâadieu to these coarse tatters, (Tearing them.) Jewels, Silks, Ermine, shall supply their place! Elmira. Once more will we shine forth your idol Daughters, Adorn'd with all that can Sultanas grace! (They solicit their Father to bring them presents, which he inserts on his tablets, turning at last towards Selima.) And now for Sister, she'll ask I supposeâ Hassan. I wish our Garden did but boast a Rose! (She requests for the old Man's kindness her Father will bring her one.) Zorayda. A Rose, indeed! worthy herself the boon! Pray Miss, a Rose in May, or Rose in June? Cymballo. We must departâhow sweet de South Wind blows! (Merchant and Cymballo prepare to depart.) Zorayda. Mind Father our rich suitsâand Sister's Rose? Exeunt Merchant and Cymballo. (Both Daughters laugh.) Hassan. (Mocking them) Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! Likenesses oft 'tween Flowers and Fair ones strike! But flower of Brimstone is the flower you're like! Exit. As Selima is departing, the Cloud King suddenly appears before herâshe screamsâher Father re-enters âa combat ensuesâCymballo hurries on to his assistance, and the Cloud King is disarmed, but caught in the arms of Attendants, and invisibly borne offâthe Merchant embraces Selima, and they exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IV. Aerial Palace of the Cloud King, erected on luminous skirted Cloudsâa splendid Throne in the centre. Attendants, properly habited, discovered in appropriate attitudes. AIRâCLOUD KING's ATTENDANTS. From his Throne and Dominion, in mortal array, Lur'd by Beauty, on Love's downy wing, To Virtue seduce, does our Sovereign stray, Long loiters our truant Cloud King. Behold! he approaches! the garb he retains, In which he Deceit's wiley arts wou'd perform, Fierce, fierce roll his eye-balls, rage reddens his veins, And Resentment and Love fire the King of the Storm. Borne on a Cloud he descends, preceded by an attendant. Hail, King of the Clouds! we wou'd greet thy return, But well we know Virtue thy arts has withstood; For curious, we long since did anxiously burn, In yon mystical Urn, thrice three drops of our blood! He ascends his Throne, and, displaying the miniature of Selima, vows enjoyment and revenge; then, seizing the hands of his attendants, demands their aidâwrapt in mysterious contemplation, they form a circle, continuing in mystic action, to music, 'till, suddenly breaking off, they point to a Cloud, on which appears inscribed: âSelima, 'ere she become thine, must prove accessary to Azor's death.â He starts, appears wrapped in thought, snatches up his sceptre, and, waving it, that cloud disappears, and others opening, display his commands to his attendants; on the first is written: âA Storm must assail her Sire;â on another: âShould he approach his Palace, inspire the Beast with Resentment.â His attendants having received their orders, he strikes a third Cloud, in the centre of which appears (surrounded with Glory) a splendid dagger, and the following enigmatical prophesy: âThy Bane, or Antidote!â He appears much perplexed, scarcely knowing how to act; at length snatches the daggerâthunder and lightningâthe latter emitted from the Clouds in the sceneâ DUO AND QUARTETTO ATTENDANTS. Two Male Voices. Hail, King of the Clouds! we thy wish will perform, Ride proud on the whirlwind and govern the storm. Two Female Voices. Hail, King of the Clouds! shou'd the storm rage in vain, In the breast of the Beast shall revenge fiercely reign. QUARTETTO. Revenge or Enjoyment their pleasures shall bring, And Vengeance or Love cheer our element King! Exeunt. The Scene vanishing with them, and discovering,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. A dark Wood, through which, from the situation of the Trees, appear a variety of intricate avenues, backed by a mazey labyrinthâa most tremendous storm, intermingled with cries of distress, vivid flashes of lightning, and tremendous peals of thunder, &amp;c. &amp;c. In the intervals of the storm Scander is seen on his Horse, which attacked by an angry Lion, as it crosses the stage, emits fire from his nostrils, followed by Cymballo on foot in the greatest agitation âa dreadful crash is heard, and Cymballo re-enters, indicating he has lost his master, and that he must inevitably have been dashed to atomsâa distant moan is heardâCymballo startsâoffers up a short prayer and rushes offâthe moan is repeated, and he returns with the Merchant breathless, and wounded by his fall; on being brought forward he faints in Cymballo's arms, who gives him a cordialâhe revives âthey are attacked by an immense Serpent, which they at length destroy; and, the atmosphere appearing lighter, thanking Heaven for their deliverance, the Travellers, by the light of the Moon, prepare to renew their journey, but are suddenly prevented by a torrent of rainâin vain, they endeavour to shelter themselves, the trees they select for that purpose being struck by thunderbolts, and torn asunderâat length a chasm suddenly appears, discovering a distant illuminated portal, leading to a splendid Palace, richly adorned with festal lampsâ the Tempest still continuing, the Merchant resolves to take shelter thereâCymballo, trembling, solicits him to refrain; but, drawing his sword, he compells him to precede him, and they approach the Portico. N.B. The Attendants of the Cloud King are occasionally visible during this scene, with Talismanic power giving birth to the storm, and impelling the attacks of the Lion, Serpent, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. The Avenue leading to the PalaceâStorm occasionally vehement. The Merchant and Cymballo enter very cautiously, the latter with evident signs of terror. ECHO SONGâCYMBALLO. Cym. Holloa! Echo. âHolloa! Cym. Some one answers! Echo. âSome one answers! Cym. Me begin, Echo. âBegin. Cym. Hark! Echo. âHark! Cym. Somebody's within, Echo. âSomebody's within. Cym. Valour whispers, be undaunted, Echo. âBe undaunted. Cym. Me tremble! (aside) nor by fear be haunted, Echo. âNor by fear be haunted, Cym. Hark! Echo. âHark! Cym. How the tempest roars, Echo. âThe tempest roars! Cym. Who'd not wish to be in doors! Echo. âBe in doors. Cym. Are your invitations right? Echo. âOur invitations right? Cym. Shall we, Sir, here pass the night? Echo. âHere pass the night. Cym. What here pass the night? Echo. âHere pass the night. Cym. The night? Echo. âThe night. They both enter the Palace with much anxiety and trepidation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VII. A magnificent Apartment formed of two circular Balconies, brilliantly illuminated, supported by Musical figuresâthe centre opens to a practicable Fountain, leading to which, is, amidst a variety of beautiful decorations, a fine Rose Tree in bloom on an elegant stand. Enter Scander and Cymballo with trepidation, the latter starts, even at the appearance of the figures, and endeavours to prevail on his Master to returnâ he sheathes his sword, and intimates fatigueâCymballo follows his example. RECITATIVEâCYMBALLO. Ah! Massa! you much tire! dat too my case! But me no like to stay in dis lone place! No Servants here attendâunder or upper! (Scander shews signs of Hunger) Aye, me like you too, want a dam good Supper! (A cover'd Table rises with a rich Supper.) They both startâthe Merchant, at first surprised, appears looking for a seatâa sopha instantly rises âMerchant seats himself, inviting Cymballo, who slily snatches bits occasionally, but dreadfully alarmed. RECITATIVEâCYMBALLO. Well, all dis nice! me thirsty too, me find!â Oh! for some!âby my whiskers, it is Wind! A Sideboard rises with Wine, Olives, &amp;c. &amp;c.âhe tastes the former; then helps his Master, frequently remembering himself, 'till he gradually becomes gay and merryâ RECITATIVEâCYMBALLO. Who feel Fear now! Wine give to Valour zest! Wid Moosic now! dis make a Lord Mayor's Feast! The apparent musical figures which supported the Galleries step forward, all playing on different instruments, a short PANDEAN CONCERT. Cym. A Feast indeed! Mirth seem on Mirth advancing! Keep up de Ball, me love a little Dancing. A GROUPE OF BEAUTIFUL DANCING GIRLS TRIP ON, AND EXECUTE A SHORT, BUT LIVELY FIGURE. While Cymballo appears absorbed in admiration of these magical events, the Beauty of the Rose Tree attracts the attention of Scander, and, recollecting his promise to Selima, he approaches and plucks a Roseâon which, accompanied by an awful peal of Thunder, the Dancers, Musicians, Table, Refreshment, &amp;c. vanish, and a terrific Monster, armed with an Herculean Club, rushes onâScander and Cymballo fall, trembling, at his feetâhe draws the following scroll from his Club, âThou must die, or Selima, for whom thou hast plucked that Rose, take thy Placeâ The Merchant, in the greatest agitation, reads the scroll, and is on the point of opposing the Monster, when Cymballo eagerly plucks him by the sleeve, and whispers. RECITATIVEâCYMBALLO. Oh, Massa! (what a miserable hour!) Consent toâ(lud a marcy, me be heard!) To any thingâto get out of his power, Me no was speakingâwas me?ânot one word. The Merchant, in hopes of seeing his Children once more, eagerly embraces the idea, and, receiving the scroll, consents to surrender Selima in his stead, when, the Monster again striking the earth with his Club, a rich chest rises full of splendid dresses, which he commands Cymballo to direct two Slaves to convey to his Master's; and eagerly enforcing the performance of the oath, escorts them offâthen returning, leans mournfully on his Club, absorbed in reflectionâat length throws a ring into the Fountain, from which Benigno rises, and comes forward, to whom he kneels. RECITATIVEâBENIGNO. In vain are thy prayers, thy complaints are all vain, Tho' a life of Despair thou hast prov'd, The Form thou hast lost ne'er can grace thee again, Till by Beauty thou'rt pitied and lov'd. I know thy Heart's tender, thy Bosom is pure, But nought can thy Anguish remove; The Charm that transform'd thee must ever endure, 'Till Beauty that Heart shall approve. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VIII. Interior of a neat Turkish Cottage as beforeâ small table and stool, writing utensils, and a flower glass on the table. Enter Scander despondent, followed by Cymballo, bringing on the box, the former the Rose. RECITATIVEâCYMBALLO. Alla be prais'd! tho' the sad dye be cast! We have reach home (Merchant sighs.) not happinessâat last! Of all the Flowers gather'd, who'd supposeâ Dat we should be so nettled, 'bout a Rose! (The Merchant, with a sigh, places the Rose in a Flower Glass! makes signs to Cymballo to put water to it.) How ugly now dis beauteous Flower appears! Me vexed so, me could water it wid tears! Goes off. Scander comes forward with the scroll, which he examines with agitation, and at length seems determined to embrace Death, rather than risque the life of his DaughterâCymballo returns with the Rose, &amp;c. and places it on the table; at which Scander, after desiring Cymballo to convey the Trunk of Dresses to his Daughters, seats himself, and writes, âI yield to FateâChildren farewell for ever!â Much fatigued with the various occurrences he had experienced, he then drops to sleep.âSelima enters, approaches him cautiously, perceives the Rose, inhales its perfumes with delight, and kisses gratefully her Father's handâperceiving the scroll, she reads It alarmed, during which he suddenly awakes, and starts upâCymballo and her Sisters enterâthey groupeâa pauseâthe Merchant embraces Selima. RECITATIVE. Zoray. We've heard it all!â(look!âshe's the first caress'd!) Heard the strange end, Miss, of your strange request! Elmira. Thus to plant thorns in a fond Father's breast! Selima, terror struck, occasionally casts her eyes on the Rose, the scroll, and her Fatherâat length directs enquiring glances towards Cymballo. RECITATIVEâCYMBALLO. Missee, me tell you!âAlla! how provoking? (Looking at her Sisters.) Cursee hard hearts!âmy troat be almost choaking! Selima learns a part from Cymballo, of their unfortunate adventuresâduring which her Sisters persuade Scander not to returnâhaving obtained sufficient intelligence of the fate allotted her, she rushes forward, tears the scroll her Father had written, and, kissing the one given him by the Monster, intimates she will gladly take his place. RECITATIVEâZORAYDA TO HER FATHER. That you should suffer, filial Love denies! The Cause alone, should be the Sacrifice! Elmira. The wished attempt, let her essay at least? Her charms (who knows) may captivate the beast! Selima, kissing Scander's hand, rushes off, followed by Cymballoâher Sisters detain their Father, and endeavouring to pacify, draw him off on the opposite side.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IX. A most beautiful Apartment, in the centre of which is a very elegant Mirror, to which a handsome curtain appertains; in a conspicuous part of the scene this inscription, âSelima's Apartment.â Enter, cautiously, the Cloud King, disguised in a rich outward garmentâa mask in his handâpreceded by one of his attendants. RECITATIVEâATTENDANT. Deeper disguised, thus alter'd to her view, Thou must prevent th'approaching interview; Or such is (tho' transform'd) Prince Azor's power, In vain thou'll't, fiend-like, prowl here to devour! They retireâenter Cymballo and Selima, trembling. RECITATIVEâCYMBALLO. Me've kept my promise (reads âSelima's Apartmentâ) see, dis Dome your own! Dear! how gallant the Gentleman has grown! I ca'n't forget his looks, they struck me mute! What a fine kennel this for such a Brute! (Voice without, âAvaunt!â) He hears me! pardon, pardon good Prince Grim! Me dance attendance once more on your whim! Cloud King. Reptile, crawl henceâ Cymballo. âCrawl!âMissee!âcrawl!âme flyâ Dontee be frightfulâblessee heartâgood bye! Exit Cymballo. Selima turning round, much agitated, suddenly perceives the Cloud King, who, partly concealing his face in a sable mask, fondly approaches and kneels before herâastonished, she flies himâhe pursuesâseizeâand attempts to carry her offâ she solicitsâhe draws a daggerâshe kneelsâhe beckons on his attendant who displays a scroll, on which is written in blood-stained characters: âI SWEAR TO BE THINEââ he plucks a pen from his Turban, and tells her she must sign itâshe shudders, and refusesâenraged, he attempts to stab herâthe Monster rushes on, forces the dagger from him, and he vanishing in a Cloud, receives Selima fainting in his armsâreviving, she shudders at his hideous formâhe throws himself at her feetâshe attempts to fly him, but he gently prevents her, and motions on a number of Sylphs, who pay her homage, assuring her he is her Slave, and lives but to obey herâshe unfolds the scroll he had given her Father, and asks, why he was so cruel to himâhe replies, love for her compelled himâshe requests permission to returnâhe sorrowfully refuses, but to convince her that her Father is safe, strikes the curtain appertaining to the mirror, which slowly rises, and Scander and her two Sisters are discovered in it âhe weeping, they sing the following TRIOâSCANDER, ZORAYDA, AND ELMIRA. The darling of my heart, sweet maid! Mild as the bleating lamb; Who while it nips the tender blade, Scarce wanders from its dam. Thy hapless lot, we cheerless mourn, When, Fate, wilt thou forbear? 'Till lovely Selima's return, Must flow the silent tear! Delighted with the sight, Selima is on the point of rushing into Scander's arms, which the Monster trembling prevents, pointing to an inscription over the Mirror, which that instant appears, to this purport: âApproach not?â The curtain, at the same time, gradually descending âshe accuses him of unkindness, and repeats her request to re-visit her Father, promising speedily to returnâhe seems divided between hope and fear, affection, and the dread of losing her, but more tenderly urging her solicitationsâhe consents, strikes the earth with his Club, the curtain ascends, and in lieu of the mirror, appears a most brilliant transparent Grotto, from which Benigno comes forward, and receiving from the Monster a ring, and the dagger he had taken from the Cloud King, presents them to Selima. RECITATIVEâBENIGNO. Receive, fair maid, in love's fond hour, This ring, which frees thee from his power; But shou'd thy absence long extend, His life thy cruelty will end: And lovely Maiden, ah! forbear To listen to a rival's prayer; If hope to him thou dost impart, Thy cruelty will break his heart! Selima receives them, and in return presents her Bracelet as a token of her speedy returnâBenigno waves his wand, a beautiful Palanquin is brought on by Slaves, in which she is placed and borne offâ the Monster, affectionately and pensively, retires with Benigno.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE X. The Garden as before, Arbour, &amp;c. Enter Cloud King with his sword drawn, vowing revenge on Selima's Father, followed by first Attendant, and Assassinsânoise withoutâhe compells them to retireâCymballo, much frightened, rushes onâ RECITATIVE. Cymballo. Poor Missee!âwhere she now?âmayhap no moreâ Her lilly skin crimson'd, perhaps, with gore! The Monster! his cursed visage still's in view! (Enter Hassan (the old Gardener) who strikes him on the shoulderâhe starts.) Oh lud ha' mercy! Hassan, is it you? Hassan. Aye, by the 'Coran! 'sbud! what do'st thou ail? Thy Lips look just like Turnips, they're so pale! But, if the colour from thy Lips are fled, Thine Eyes resemble Beet-root, they're so red! Cymballo. Hush! Massa coming! grief him's look bespeaks! Hassan. Aye, grief makes Mortals look as green as leaks. Exeunt. Enter Scanderâthe Cloud King's Attendant points him out to the Assassins, who attack him, and after a struggle he is vanquishedâSelima rushes on and saves his lifeâshe is torn from him by Assassins, who renew the attackâthe Sisters, Cymballo, old Hassan, and the Cloud King, in the habit of the Cadi, rush onâall groupeâCloud King stamps, his first Attendant rushes on with the scroll of: âI swear to be thine,â displayed as a banner, presenting it for Selima's signature âSlaves enter with a brilliant casket of Jewels, and large chests of Goldâpointing to them, the Cloud King offers life to the Merchant, and riches to his Daughters, if Selima will sign the scrollâher Father conjures her notâand, casting her eyes on the ring, she seems terror struckâher Sisters eagerly solicit her. SESTETTE AND CHORUS. Zorayda, Elmira, Cloud King's Attendant, Scander, Cymballo, and Hassan Alhabal. Zorayda. Think by Assassins Father dies, Yet happiness appears in view; Elmira. And wealth which every wish supplies, And think th'attainment rests with you. Both. We own, alas! we've cruel been, But you in kindly deeds delight; Zorayda. (aside) La! I cou'd almost die with spleen, Cymballo. Me almost wish you dying quite! Hassan. I wish that you were dying quite. Sisters. O father, we to thee now bend, Thy mere request Consent wou'd gain: Hassan. and Cymballo. May Providence its arm extend! Sisters. Ah! me, she will retract again. Cymballo. Me fear, alas! their point they'll gain. Hassan. I fear, alas! their point they'll gain. In the utmost agitation, overcome by their solicitations, with dread and reluctance, she affixes her signature, and the following Ã¦rial strain suddenly bursts forth. ÃRIALâCHORUS. She is thine! she is thine! For her coyness the sorceress soon shall attone In thy glory divine, Soon, Element King, shalt thou seize on thine own. The Cloud King, encircled by vapour, ascends, and his Attendants vanishâthunder, lightning, &amp;c.â Selima, gazing on the ring, wildly rushes off, Scander follows.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE XI. A rocky Viewâwith a wild mossy Grotto on one sideâa Rock leads from the opposite side, to a high Promontoryâa dark sky, The Monster, almost exhausted with grief and dispair, crosses the Rocks. VOICES IN THE AIR. False, false to her word, She her aid does deny, No hope now is left thee, Despair then and die. He sighs piteously, and kissing the Bracelet he had received from Selima, throws himself off the promontory, and, wounded by the fall, creeps forward, scarce able to support himself, approaches the Grotto, there to breathe his lastâSelima, wildly, crosses the Rock, and for some time searches in vain, but at length perceives him, who, with a deep sigh, closes his eyesâshe conceives him deadâkneels and weeps near himâa loud peal of thunder heard, lightnings flashâand a circle of Clouds gradually descends, on which the Cloud King, in all his glory, is seated, attendants on each side him, one bearing the Banner, which consigns Selima to his power, she wildly clasps her hands in despair. QUARTETTO Altered from M. G. Lewis.âCLOUD KING's ATTENDANTS In vain, 'tis fair lady, those hands that you wring, The bond is compleated, the dye it is cast; In his glory now claims thee our element King, His rival by thee doomed to here breathe his last! Selima's agitation and pity for the poor dying Monster encreases, and she endeavours anxiously and affectionately to revive himâopening his eyes he fondly gazes on her, and gratefully kisses her handâshe partly raises himâthe Cloud King descends, and indignantly approaches herâshe draws her daggerâhe seems transfixedâa pauseâenter Benigno. RECITATIVEâBENIGNO. Rejoice, rejoice, Pity and Gratitude, Virtues adored, To Love most pure kindly have given birth, Thy Form her fond Affection has restored, And soon reward will Innocence and Worth. Benigno striking the Beast with his wand, he resumes his own shape, that of a handsome Persian Prince, most splendidly attired, and affectionately embraces Selima.âRudely separating them, the Cloud King (ordering the Banner she had signed to be brought forward) majestically claims herâAzor interposesâ Cloud King seizes her, she attempts to dispatch him with her dagger, he disarms and allows her but a moment to reflect whether she will become his or dieâshe refusesâhe raises his hand to strikeâBenigno receives the blow on his wand, and the dagger breaks into enumerable piecesâhe again demands her on the strength of her signatureâwhich Benigno striking, the Banner takes fire. RECITATIVEâBENIGNO. Loud yell, proud DÃ¦mon, your lot's now despair, Thy magic Dagger, king, has proved thy bane, Thy mighty Power thus vanishes in air, Thy Indignation threatens now in vain. Enraged the Cloud King ascends, and the Clouds dispersing, discover</field>

A GRAND PROCESSION, AND DANCE TAKES PLACE; After which, Scander, Zorayda, and Elmira enterâ Selima affectionately embraces her Fatherâher Sisters gloomily solicit a reconciliation, which Selima appears inclined to grant. RECITATIVEâBENIGNO. And ye, Pride's slaves, by Envy's minions lead, Justice with punishment wou'd not dispense; Did not the Wrong'd for your forgiveness plead, Then grateful bend to injur'd Innocence. FINALE. Magic in vain its power wou'd prove, But love speaks trumpet tongu'd, tho' dumb; To virtue, gratitude and love, Then clash the cymbal, beat the drum. Tread the dance in sportive measure, Beauty has obtain'd her Cause; This the night of joy and pleasure, If but crown'd with your applause. FINIS.</field>
