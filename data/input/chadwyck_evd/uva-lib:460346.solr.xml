      <field name="fulltext">The Tragedy Of Marcus Brutus: With the Prologue and the Two Last Chorus's.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE by the AUTHOR. Our Scene is Athens. And Great Athens nam'd, What Soul so dull as not to be enflam'd? Methinks, at mentioning that sacred place, A reverend Awe appears in ev'ry Face, For Men so fam'd, of such prodigious Parts, As taught the World all Sciences and Arts. Amidst all these, ye shall behold a Man The most applauded since Mankind began; Out-shining ev'n those Greeks who most excell; Whose Life was one fix'd course of doing well. Oh who can therefore without Tears attend On such a Life, and such a fatal End? But here our Author, besides other Faults Of ill Expressions, and of vulgar Thoughts, Commits one Crime that needs an Act of Grace, And breaks the Law of Unity of Place: Yet, to such noble Patriots, overcome By factious Violence, and banish'd Rome, Athens alone a fit Retreat could yield: And where can Brutus fall, but in Philippi Field? Some Criticks judge, ev'n Love itself too mean A care to mix in such a lofty Scene, And with those ancient Bards of Greece believe Friendship has stronger Charms to please or grieve: But our more am'rous Poet, finding Love Amidst all other Cares still shines above; Lets not the best of Romans end their Lives Without just softness for the kindness Wives. Yet, if ye think his gentle Nature such, As to have soften'd this great Tale too much, Soon will your Eyes grow dry, and Passion fall; When ye reflect 'tis all but Conjugall. This to the few and knowing was addrest; And now 'tis fit I should salute the rest. Most reverend, dull Judges of the Pit, By Nature curs'd with the wrong side of Wit! You need not care what e'er you see to Night, How ill some Players act, or Poets write; Should our mistakes be never so notorious, You'll have the joy of being more censorius Shew your small Talent then, let that suffice ye, But grow not vain upon it, I advise ye; Each petty Critic can Objections raise, The greatest Skill is knowing when to praise.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Vestibule in Athens. Enter Lucilius and Varius. LUCILIUS. Express upon Express arrives from Rome. Their Veneration for most noble Brutus Is now reviv'd, and makes all mourn his Absence. VARIUS. But yet some threaten to destroy us here, For giving shelter to that worthy Roman: What means this Contradiction? LUCILIUS. I'll inform you. Our Empire groan'd beneath the Power of CÃ¦sar; A Man so fam'd for Clemency and Courage, (Qualities charming ev'n in Enemies) That none, tho' virtuous, could resolve to act A bold and noble Deed, which all Men wish'd. VARIUS. You mean the Death of CÃ¦sar. Pray go on. LUCILIUS. At length, a Man of all the World inclin'd The least to Violence, or any Passion; A Man sublimely wise, exactly justâ VARIUS. After this Character you need not name him. LUCILIUS. Brutus, the Head of all those noble Spirits Who shine at Rome, and rule the under World, Selects the very choicest of them all, And fells the Tyrant in the very Senate. VARIUS. This Deed of Brutus seems the Will of Heav'n. LUCILIUS. And so accounted, for his wondrous Virtue. The Soldiers, Senators, and common People, (If among Romans they can be so call'd) Ev'n the best Friends of CÃ¦sar follow'd Brutus, As the avow'd Deliv'rer of his Country: Till his soft Nature, and his gen'rous Spirit, Resign'd the Corps to be interr'd with Honour. VARIUS. That made this fatal Change as we are told. LUCILIUS. Most true, in those that heard the fam'd Oration. What is it Eloquence cannot persuade? Reason it self comes over to its side. Thus Antony, soon as his Speech was ended, Rais'd in that Heat so great a Rage against us, As forc'd ev'n Friends to act the part of Foes: Yet now the wise repent, and rev'rence Athens For thus supporting the most worthy Brutus. VARIUS. The Roads from Rome are fill'd by valiant Crowds, Who fly from Safety, to partake our Danger. LUCILIUS. No wonder: since Virtue has ever fix'd Kind Correspondence between Rome and Athens. The Youth of Rome, and all whom Rome has conquer'd, Hither repair to learn Philosophy. Chief among these, you (Son of famous Tully,) Advis'd no doubt by your illustrious Father, Invited Brutus and his Brother Cassius To make great Athens Center of the War. VARIUS. And she has own'd your Cause in ample manner. Armies are levy'd, and vast Sums are rais'd, In the defence of Roman Liberty. LUCILIUS. Oh Noble efforts of Republick Spirit! Why this is being Friends to Humane kind; Which, next to Heav'n, is most oblig'd to those Who rescue Liberty from vile Oppression. VARIUS. Our ancient Heroes thus grew Gods themselves: Besides, 'tis in a manner Self-defence To help in neighb'ring Dangers; for it hinders Future Incroachments on our selves at home. LUCILIUS. Of that, Athenians are almost too jealous: Ev'n with Ingratitude they crush Ambition, And banish Merit, when the least aspiring. VARIUS. Most wisely do they act, nay justly too: For, we reward a Leader's Service best, In barring him the means of doing Mischief. Happier, much happier had it been for CÃ¦sar, Had he been banish'd, while yet innocent, Than e'er return'd triumphant o'er his Country. SCENE II. Enter Dolabella pulling off his Disguise. LUCILIUS. What! Dolabella here? DOLABELLA. A Friend to Varius, Sent by Antonius in most secret manner, To ask an Interview of noble Brutus, Before the Soldier joins in bloody Battel. Who knows but each great Chief may grow more kind, In sight of wondring Armies may embrace, And Rome shall smile at their returning Friends? (Exit Lucilius. VARIUS. And can you think that Brutus slew great Julius, To suffer Tyranny in other Hands? DOLABELLA. Alas, that Tyranny is but a word, Us'd only by us when we hate our Ruler. Have we not found (you'll pardon me, good Varius) That ev'n this Change you call'd Deliverance Has but remov'd one Hardship for a greater, A single Grievance for a Civil War. VARIUS. What do I hear! Is any Grievance equal To that most abject State of being Subjects To Will, to Passion, or to lawless Humour? DOLABELLA. Yet these expressions shew 'tis not mere ruling, But ruling ill, you fear. When Prudence sways, Tis Happiness, not Slav'ry, to be govern'd. To bless our Times with Plenty, and with Pleasures, Prevent Disorders, and promote Diversions, Hinder us all from hurting one another, Take all the Cares, and leave us all the Joys, Can only be accomplish'd by great Power, When plac'd in such a Man as God-like Brutus. VARIUS. Where is Content or Pleasure under force? The Freedom of Man's Will not Heav'n constrains: Who wants it, and endures it, is a Brute. Yet put the case some PhÅnix Prince should reign, A Vulture might succeed; a Son, or Brother, Who will undo in a few Months of Folly, (For short will be his Reign, tho' seeming long) Whate'er the Wise had been whole Years contriving. Like Brutus did you say? A Man like Brutus No more would be a Sov'reign, than a Slave: A Man so virtuous, and so wise, well knows 'Tis better much to bear than do a Hardship. DOLABELLA. What hardship's done by acting for Men's good? VARIUS. What good can come from arbitrary Sway? The choicest fare, forc'd down, will cloy the Stomach. But here he comes himself to hear your Message. At once the humblest and the highest Mind That ever shin'd in all our Roman Story! (Exit Varius. SCENE III. Enter Brutus. BRUTUS. A Message from Antonius claims a Hearing, Whom, tho' my Enemy, I still esteem. DOLABELLA. His boldest Wishes aim at nothing higher, And therefore thus assures most noble Brutus; That what he has done, was by Nature forc'd From his fresh Sorrow for his slaughter'd Friend; But now his bleeding Country moves him more, And his Soul shakes at sight of Civil War. Secure him but by taking Sov'reign Pow'r, To you alone he joins with all his Force. BRUTUS. And I abandon Cassius, and my Friends? DOLABELLA. Far be it from me to propose such Baseness. May they, and we, be happy under you, And the whole World once govern'd by the Virtuous. BRUTUS. Ah, Dolabella, little do you know The Mind of Brutus. When I slew your CÃ¦sar Think you it was Ambition? Jove is Witness I would have crown'd him rather than my self. But Rome claim'd Freedom, tho' by CÃ¦sar's Death; Tho' by Destruction of my dearest Friend: And free she shall be still, if I prevail. Antonius joining in that glorious Work, May claim whate'er a Commonwealth can give: Nay, I will be his Soldier in her Service. Then, neither he nor we shall longer strive, But only who shall serve his Country best. DOLABELLA. Will you then rather see the World in Arms, Than govern it your self to make it happy? BRUTUS. May the great Gods destroy that World and me, If e'er I suffer Rome to be enslav'd! Rome, that has toil'd for Fame so many Ages, By Valour, and by Virtue tam'd Mankind, Soften'd rude Minds, and in the wildest Soils Establish'd Manners and Humanity; And, cultivating Youth with strictest care, First taught Urbanity, that useful Art Of being most politely sociable; (A Virtue scarce known in the World beside, And chiefly owing to our Liberty) Gods! shall all this sink into mean Submission? Which in a Moment would debase our Souls, Like those in wretched Governments around us. DOLABELLA. But yet Submission seems design'd by Nature, Why else has she bestow'd such diff'rent Talents? Some, like your own, with worth, and skill to govern; And Thousands only fitted to obey. BRUTUS. As well you might imagine harmless Sheep Only created for the rav'nous Wolf. DOLABELLA. But is Man blameable for mast'ring both? BRUTUS. No; for those Beasts are of inferior Rank: But where does Nature, or the Will of Heav'n, Subject a Creature to one like it self? Man is the only Brute enslaves his Kind. DOLABELLA. 'Tis not the Shape, but Soul, that shews the likeness: Is a mere Changeling like a Man of Prudence? BRUTUS. A Man of Prudence never will at once Make both himself and all the World unhappy. Think you that 'tis for Envy, Kings are hated? Pity would rather plead in their Defence, Did we not more compassionate their Subjects. Alas, they scarce have one contented Hour, Few to confide in, and whole Crowds to fear; Asham'd to rule so many wiser Subjects, Yet often sway'd by weaker than themselves. DOLABELLA. All this were reconcil'd, if Brutus govern'd; Freedom and Empire might consist together: Your self would be the only Man uneasy; Which, for the sake of all, you will not grudge. BRUTUS. If there were colour for so vile a Change, Or the least Pleasure in the greatest Power; Yet I abhor what I disdain to hear. Return in Safety back, but tell Antonius, My highest Wish is to fix Rome in Freedom; My next, to dye before she is enslav'd. (Exit Dolabella, Manet Brutus. SCENE IV. Enter Varius and Lucilius. VARIUS. The Areopagite Council long have sate, To do great Brutus some unwonted Honour. Some voted to renew th' Olympic Games, Others with Plays would crowd the Theatres; But these were held Diversions too divine, And only consecrated to the Gods. At last, the wisest and most famous Senate, In love to you, in service to the Publick, In veneration for superior Virtue, Resolves to rear your Statue carv'd by Samius, That greatest Artist, for the best of Men; And place it in the sacred Temple, next Harmonius and Aristogiton, Those worthy Patriots of learned Athens. LUCILIUS. How many Ages hence shall wealth of Princes Vye for these dear Remains, so doubly famous, Both for the Work, and him it represents! BRUTUS. Was ever Honour from so wise a People Design'd so kindly, yet bestow'd so ill? I am not only destitute of Merit, But of Ambition, more than to do good. Fame's only due for Deeds beyond our Duty; Who can do those in Service of his Country? The Romans, and ev'n Cassius, may repine At such a partial proof of their Affection. Advise me how to shun it with Respect. VARIUS. You should not, cannot now, without Affront. No mean Assembly this, such as proceeds In shew for publick Good, with private Aim; Sluggish to meet, yet hasty to resolve. These, in safe Methods, and with prudent Steps, Encourage Virtue, and uphold their Country. SCENE V. Enter Cassius. CASSIUS. I greet my Friend on this new Complement; Which, in your Name, shews a Respect to all. The Death of CÃ¦sar is a common Cause, Which Commonwealths in Prudence must approve. BRUTUS. True, noble Cassius; and I never would Accept an Honour sep'rate from my Friends. Brutus has nothing in his Life or Humour Suited to this unpresidented Honour. CASSIUS. Methinks you now esteem your self too little, Only to prize this Complement too much. BRUTUS. A Statue rear'd to me, and rear'd by Athens, I own a most transcendent Obligation; But ev'ry Summ and Soldier they have rais'd In aid of Liberty, affects me more. CASSIUS. I ever thought a Roman General Above Reward from an Athenian Senate. What is a Trifle then giv'n by Grey-boards, Mov'd by a little Popularity? BRUTUS. But, to be mov'd by Envy, sure is worse. CASSIUS. I did not envy CÃ¦sar, tho' I slew him. BRUTUS. An honest Mind can envy no Usurper; You said you kill'd him for the Publick Good. CASSIUS. You know I kill'd him for the Public Good. Who doubts it, does me wrong. BRUTUS. Do none your self. What, shall we two, the Champions of Freedom, Like Children, grudge at one another's Play-things? Come, we are Friends. But think not I am fond (Embraces him. Of airy Trifles, tho' I value Fame. Fame for good Deeds is the Reward of Virtue. Thirst after Fame is giv'n us by the Gods, Both to excite our Minds to noble Acts, And give a proof of some immortal State, Where we shall know, that Fame we leave behind That highest Blessing which the Gods bestow. CASSIUS. But 'tis a greater not to need their Blessings: You Stoicks hold a wise Man is above them. BRUTUS. Yet not insensible to Reputation. For that he slights all Torments, ev'n Disgrace; Nay, what is harder yet, despises Pleasure; A strength of Mind which only Man possesses. CASSIUS. I see no such distinction, nor wherein Man so transcends, except in Arrogance. This great Superiority of Man Often comes short ev'n of the meanest Creatures: They in their ways more happily confin'd, Seem not to scorn, or bear down one another; Never ungrateful, or the least deceiving, But keep wise Nature's Laws with strict Obedience. Oh happy for the World, if in these Times Mankind in gen'ral were no worse than Brutes! BRUTUS. Ill Men, indeed, I must confess are worse. CASSIUS. And sure the worst of all, their Country's Enemies. These should be censur'd by our rev'rend Priests, Who always raise our Thoughts to things above, But yet connive at Villany below. BRUTUS. From hence the Miseries of Rome proceed. When Fraud, Oppression, foulest Calumny, Contempt of Laws, and bold Impieties, Appear barefac'd; no Auguries more sure Foretell the Ruin of a sinking State. CASSIUS. No Auguries? What do they e'er foretell, But as the Politician bribes the Priest? Mere Combination against common Sense. BRUTUS. You'll have your way. But do you not remember That Southsayer who said, the Ides of March Were come, not gone? CASSIUS. And that was all he knew: Had he known more, why did he not inform? BRUTUS. The Gods decreed that Rome should be deliver'd. VARIUS. That devout Thought revives our sinking Hopes; Heav'n will not fail a Cause it once has blest. CASSIUS. But trust not all to that, let us be careful. When you shall march to morrow after me, Should we not leave some Forces here behind? BRUTUS. For what? CASSIUS. To keep these People firmly to us. They, who at Rome command an Empire's wealth, Have dangerous Temptations of seducing. VARIUS. Oh never fear it. Shake Athenian Faith? Tis stopping Tides, or striving with the Winds. BRUTUS. They are too learn'd, and prudent, not to know That 'tis the greatest Folly to be false; Not worth a Villany to gain the World. A low mean Act so rancles in the Mind, There is no Joy, nor Quiet afterwards; Kind Heav'n has form'd us so, that we might find Content and Honesty still join'd together. CASSIUS. But, then we are the more oblig'd to guard 'em Against what they might suffer for our sakes. BRUTUS. Kindly, and justly urg'd, I must confess. But think you, that our Enemies can spare The smallest Legion from opposing us? Detaching some, may be their loss of all. Yet, for this Place I am concern'd so much, You shake my Reason when you urge their Danger. Let them propose what Guards themselves desire. CASSIUS. Nay, there I differ; since in War-affairs, With all their Wit, they cannot judge so well: Nor is it fit they judge in their own Cause. I'll strait assemble them, and then debate With calm deliberation this Affair; Which well deserves our speediest Management, Since we are forc'd to march away so soon. You'll come, I hope, and fix our resolution. (Exit Cassius. BRUTUS. This Man has some uneasiness of Temper, But over-balanc'd by his publick Spirit, Which ever sways him to his Country's Good. Whate'er our Master Zeno may have taught us, Nothing is wholly perfect here below: We should applaud the Merit that we find, And cast a friendly Veil on good Men's Faults. My Sister Junia loves him to excess; (If there can be Excess in Love, or Friendship.) Go, and acquaint her gently with the Journey Which he must take this Night towards Philippi, There to decide th' important Fate of Rome. (Exit Lucilius. I must prepare the Forces under me, To overtake him on his March to morrow: From thence we'll haste conjointly to the Battel: This scanty Road bears us not both together; And we must once divide, to part no more. (Exeunt Brutus and Varius.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">First CHORUS. Of Athenian Philosophers. Written at the Command of his Grace, by Mr. POPE. I. Ye Shades, where sacred Truth is sought, Groves, where immortal Sages taught, Where heav'nly Visions Plato fir'd, And Godlike Zeno lay inspir'd! In vain your guiltless Laurels stood Unspotted long with humane Blood: War, horrid War, your thoughful walks invades, And Steel now glitters in the Muses Shades. II. Oh Heav'n-born Sisters! Source of Art! Who charm the Sense, or mend the Heart; Who lead fair Virtue's Train along, Moral Truth, and mystick Song! To what new Clime, what distant Sky, Forsaken, friendless, shall ye fly? Say, will ye bless the bleak Atlantic Shore, Or bid the furious Gaul be rude no more? III. When Athens sinks by Fates unjust; When wild Barbarians spurn her Dust; Perhaps ev'n Britain's utmost Shore Shall cease to blush with Stranger's Gore; See Arts her savage Sons controul, An Athens rising near the Pole; Till some new Tyrant lifts his purple Hand, And civil Madness tears them from the Land. IV. Ye Gods! what Justice rules the Ball? Freedom and Arts together fall; Fools grant whate'er Ambition craves, And Men, once ignorant, are Slaves. Oh curs'd Effects of civil Hate; In ev'ry Age, in ev'ry State! Still when the Lust of Tyrant Pow'r succeeds, Some Athens perishes, some Tully bleeds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The same Vestibule. Enter Varius, with Titinius newly arriv'd at Athens. TITINIUS. What mean these sumptuous Preparations? Is this a Time for either Pomp, or Pleasure? When two, the best and boldest Sons of Rome, The justest Cause too that was e'er defended, Are on the very Brink of their Destruction. VARIUS. Oh wrong not sacred Athens, Sir, the Nurse The Mother of all Arts and Sciences: Has she spread Wit and Learning thro' the World, Nay soften'd Rome her self (but rough before) To Arts, to Eloquence, and gentler Manners; And is she now upbraided? TITINIUS. Fallacious Eloquence, and useless Arts! I own her Learning; but that Polishing Has but too much weaken'd our harder Steel. Our ancient, rough, and manly Worth now bends At the hard touch of Perils and of Toils. Our Gold is melted to a finer Shape, But mix'd with dross of Flatt'ry and Corruption. How else could Brutus be a banish'd Man? Or how could Liberty fly here for Refuge? VARIUS. And whither should it fly, if not to Athens? The School of all Philosophy and Virtue. Our publick Recreations here are sacred: This Day th' Athenians, ever true to Virtue, In this low Ebb, in spite of pow'rful Rome, Have kept their Custom tho' against their Safety, And consecrated Sports for your Success. TITINIUS. Is't possible? Pardon a Stranger's Error, Newly arriv'd with Succours from afar, Sent from the Gods, I think: for 'tis their Cause; And unknown Regions have espous'd our Quarrel. VARIUS. The Sports are just beginning; I have time Only to let you know these are not Trifles, Or such as are in Nations loose of Manners; But solemn Celebrations to the Gods, With pious Hymns imploring their Protection. Wise Athens ever has indulg'd Diversions With more Magnificence than greatest Princes: But they are all dispos'd in Praise of Virtue, Inspiring Courage, Generosity, And most of all, Affection to their Country. How think you now, Titinius? TITINIUS. I recant, And grow my self impatient for your Pleasures. SCENE II. The Scene opens, and discovers the magnificent Temple of Bacchus, where the Publick Entertainments were wont to be celebrated at Athens. The Statue of Brutus being this Day erected, is supposed to be the Occasion of these Solemnities, and must appear in the farthermost part of the Stage. After the Shews and Songs are over, Brutus, Lucilius, Titinius, and Varius remain on the Stage. LUCILIUS. By these refin'd Diversions, we perceive This Town retains its old Magnificence. No wonder Atticus, so nice a Judge, When he retir'd, preferr'd this place to all. VARIUS. Philosophy is highly'st honour'd here; And from that Fountain of superior Wisdom Flows all this Stream of Arts and Sciences. BRUTUS. Here Poetry, harmoniously divine, Is most transporting, thus accompany'd With artful Paintings, and melodious Sounds. The Muses join in all Athenian Pleasures. VARIUS. But that which has occasion'd these Delights, Gives the true taste to all; your matchless Merit. BRUTUS. Hold, Varius; too much has been said already In complement: and I receive it only As Honour done me for Rome's sake, not mine. So Prizes, taken but by vulgar Hands, Are brought in Triumph to the Capitol. LUCILIUS. Yet then, we know, that Leader justly triumphs Under whose Conduct those rich Spoils are gain'd. BRUTUS. But were our Conduct equal to our Cause, In which the noble Cassius, and my self Have here engag'd all Asia on our Side; Yet the whole World deliver'd, must acknowledge All owing to this gen'rous Commonwealth. VARIUS. Rome could not fail to find support in Athens, Her elder Sister, both in Arts and Arms, And great Protectress of fair Liberty; That Liberty to which she owes her Splendour. BRUTUS. Most truly noted: From whence ever came Good Sense, or Learning, Arts of Peace, or War? Deepness of Thought, or Nobleness of Nature? Except where Liberty enlarg'd the Mind? VARIUS. The very Air of Freedom breeds great Souls, Which Education ripens into Virtue. BRUTUS. And here inspires the usefullest of Virtues, Tender Affection to our native Country. VARIUS. My Friends and near Relations, when I took My tender leave, after a thousand Counsels, Assur'd me that their greatest Satisfaction Was, that they sent me to this famous Place Where Wisdom, and where Virtue best are taught; And own'd, when Romans write the most politely, Their highest Praise is to have copy'd well. BRUTUS. Tully himself confesses Greece superiour: Yet he, of all our famous Wits of Rome, Shines much the brightest. VARIUS. Such applause from Brutus Is a Reward equal to all his Merit. TITINIUS. To be esteem'd by you, the greatest Kings Here send their Legions, and have lent their Treasure. BRUTUS. And timely comes this Aid: Advice from Rome Assures us, all their Force is on the March. VARIUS. I thought Dissension was among their Chiefs, Each of them striving to set up himself. Enter Cassius. CASSIUS. Just now is come most unexpected News; Our Foes have forc'd their Gen'rals to be Friends, And call'd it Civil War to fight in Quarrels Between Octavius and Antony; Yet think their War is lawful against us. TITINIUS. Alas, what reasoning can there be in Fools, Who, bred in Faction, blindly join with Knaves? LUCILIUS. They are for License, not for Liberty; And love those Gen'rals best, who lead to Mischief. BRUTUS. You have describ'd a State just ripe for Ruin. CASSIUS. Small Marches need they make, to meet a Foe So eager as we are, to free our Country. Oh the delay is tiresome! BRUTUS. Yet have Patience. With Vigour act, but think of all with Caution. CASSIUS. Our Rendezvouz is settled at Philippi. BRUTUS. Thither you march to Night, and I to Morrow. But Junia comes, I fear, to mourn your Absence. (Exeunt, Manet Cassius. SCENE III. Enter Junia. JUNIA. Now, all the Gods that guard the Innocent, Protect my Cassius! they are marching hither: Ruin is rolling on us from afar. CASSIUS. Not hither, Junia; we shall spare their Pains; Our Forces intercept their bold Presumption, And I just now am making haste to meet them. JUNIA. Come then, away; with you all Pains are easy; I am this moment ready for the Journey. CASSIUS. Ready, alas! you must not for this world Share in the Shifts and Hazards I must run; Virtue, like yours, here none will dare to harm; And while you stay in Athens, I am easy; My dear, and better half, is out of Danger. JUNIA. And am I yet more wretched than I thought? I had no Comfort left for your Misfortunes, But that I was to share them ev'ry where: And will you take that from me? O 'tis hard! You would not, if you saw my sighing Heart. CASSIUS. And you should go, did I not doubt my own: But 'tis so tender always towards you, It shakes, alas, my firmest Resolutions. I, like some skilful Swimmer in a Shipwreck, Grasping his only Treasure in his Arms, May, for thy sake, make too much haste to shore, Leaving the Bark with all my Friends behind. Your Sighs would blow away my best Resolves, Soften my Soul, and slacken all its Strength. When all's at stake, I eagerly may fix My Mind on you, and never think beyond. JUNIA. Beyond? Why, is there any thing beyond The dear, the charming Object of our Love: Mere Thought of that is height of Happiness. What Image have we of Elysian Bowers, But such a gentle, calm, contented State? What has this trifle of a World to do With a blest Pair, who live embracing thus? CASSIUS. What says my Charmer? can I leave this Woman? I could look thus, and languish here for ever. Yet there's one Tye, more dear than Life, Love; 'Tis Honour, and the sacred Good of Rome. For these I kill'd the greatest Man on Earth, Engag'd the best and noblest of Mankind (And saying that, I need not name your Brother) To stab his Friend, and his own Heart at once. Since I have done all this, I must do more; Leave Junia here, and all my Joys behind. JUNIA. Did I e'er think that Cassius would forsake me? CASSIUS. Forsake? I leave you as the richest Pledge Which can be giv'n to this illustrious City, That Rome it self can be no dearer to me, Than friendly Athens for protecting you. JUNIA. Jewels we prize we seldom leave behind: Oh take me with you! my officious Love Perhaps may shield you from some sudden Danger, Soften your angry and uneasy Hours, And make Adversity it self seem pleasing. My Love could do all this, if yours were equal. (Weeps. CASSIUS. All this? nay more, what cannot Junia do? Then, since I dare not hazard you in Armies, I will stay here, and dye within your Arms. JUNIA. You dye? Oh Heav'n! the very Sound of that Checks my Designs, and chills all my Desires. CASSIUS. Hast thou not heard how hard ungrateful Rome Pursues the Men who once deliver'd her, And riots in the Blood of her Redeemers? Two of our Band they have destroy'd already, And vow to spare no Murderer of CÃ¦sar; That is to say, no Man that lov'd his Country, Ruin'd himself, only to rescue her. JUNIA. Oh I have talk'd too long: go on, make haste; I am not wont, alas, to use this Language, But now I can say nothing else: Away, No matter what becomes of Me, away. CASSIUS. Your spotless Fame must always be your Guard, Rudeness it self will reverence such Virtue. I must immediately haste to our Friends, Who all assembled in the Fields of Sardis, Wait there for me and Brutus. He, to morrow, Shall follow, at the Head of mighty Numbers, Rais'd only by the Credit of our Cause; A Cause, well worthy of the World to succour! Oh, while I languish out this long, long Absence, Take care of all my Treasure, thy dear self. JUNIA. Farewel! thou truest, kindest, best of Men! But one Look moreâand then a long Farewel To all Contentâall, till we meet again. (Exit Cassius, Manet Junia. SCENE IV. Enter Varius. VARIUS. Junia in Tears! so shines an April Sun; And so the precious Dew that drops on Flowers, Steals down unheeded by the vulgar Eye: But I admire this Master-piece of Nature. JUNIA. Alas, my Lord, Cassius is gone to Sardis. VARIUS. Is't possible? So I was told before, Yet never could believe it till this moment. JUNIA. Why, was it not determin'd so in Council? VARIUS. I must confess it was debated there, And wish'd by some, that all our Force at Sardis Had some great Chief, for keeping martial Sway: But who could hope that Cassius would be willing To part from you, one Day, without Occasion? JUNIA. Is it so strange that Cassius should be forward In all the Proofs of Courage, or of Conduct? VARIUS. His Fame forbids I should have such a Thought. But yetâ JUNIA. But what? I cannot guess your Meaning. VARIUS. Not all the noble Discipline of War, Strict Rules of Conduct, Heat of martial Prowess, The Faith of Friendship, or the Oaths of Leagues, Not Fame it self, no nor the Publick Good, Deserve to be preferr'd to Junia's Love. JUNIA. But Rome's at stake. VARIUS. And well it would be lost, For staying here one Night within those Arms. JUNIA. Varius, so high a Complement as this Shews you have study'd long at courtly Athens; Where you have learn'd to know all things, but me: Who, tho' I value Caius Cassius, As Slaves do Liberty, or sick Men Health, Nay more than most of my own Sex love Power; Yet (what I think the very worst of Fates) I would lose sight of that dear Man for ever, Rather than see him fail our Country's Cause. VARIUS. Oh ample Recompence for all his Troubles, To be so lov'd by you! But is he grateful, Who can so easily endure your Absence? JUNIA. I mourn for his, and judge his Grief by mine. Retirement suits a solitary Wife, And Melancholy loves to be alone. (Offers to go out. VARIUS. But should not be indulg'd against your Health. (Stops her. Rather shine forth, and chear your Brother's Soul, Which daily sinks beneath a thousand Cares. JUNIA. His Soul's too great to need such feeble Help. Besides, tho' priz'd he be above Expression, Yet ev'n his Friendship must not vye with Love: One Thought of Cassius out-weighs all things else. Cassius, whose noble Soul would ne'er submit To him who domineer'd o'er all besides: Cassius, Contriver of the Tyrant's Fall; And, (what is more, far more than all the rest) That hardy Man who mov'd it first to Brutus. This Man, my Husband, or my Hero rather, Shall with his Presence ever chear my Eyes, Or in his Absence take up all my Thoughts. (Exit Junia. SCENE V. Enter Brutus. BRUTUS. My Sister weeping! Tho' her Reason governs, I judge her Grief for Cassius, by my own, For Portia's Absence sits upon my Heart: Nor need I blush to bear the tender Burthen, So much she merits, and so well she loves. But publick Cares must silence private Grief; Since ev'ry Hour some fresh Expresses tell New fatal Turns in Rome, portending ill: The wav'ring Lepidus (perceiving CÃ¦sar Had cunningly agreed with Antony) Tho' with a greater Army, yields to them. VARIUS. What says the noble Brutus?âJunia gone! BRUTUS. Is Varius deaf to Dangers of his Country? VARIUS. Forbid it Jove! But Junia's Melancholy, So very moving, took up all my Thoughts. BRUTUS. Too moving, I'm afraid. VARIUS. Indeed my Lord, Had you perceiv'd the Charms of weeping Beauty, That gorgeous Dress which Sorrow had put on, (Out-shining all the Gaiety of Youth, The pleasing Smiles of Mirth, and Airs of Joy) Your gentle Nature would be mov'd like mine. BRUTUS. Why you have drawn a Picture, my young Varius, Like any Poet, nay like any Lover. What, does that word draw forth a guilty Blush? Be not alarm'd, no more than I am, Varius; Junia's strict Virtue and known Love to Cassius, Fully prevent my Fears, unless for you; Whose Father's wond'rous Merit, and your own, Give me a soft Concern, as for a Son. She is above your very vainest Hopes: Not the most tempting Charms of Wit, or Worth, Most graceful Forms, or dazling shew of Greatness, Can make Impression on a Mind like her's; Who, tho' my Sister, forces Praises from me. VARIUS. Too much, alas, I join in Junia's Praise: My eager Thoughts still fly before your Words, And find them short, far short of Junia's due. BRUTUS. Then whence can rise self-flatt'ring Expectation? Can Varius reason thus against himself, And act quite contrary to what he thinks? Oh what is Man, when blinded with his Passion! VARIUS. Why just that Creature Heaven thought fit to make him. You are, indeed, exempt from all our Follies, And rest serene within: Yet pity others! Behold, I own my undisguis'd Offence, And freely open all my Thoughts to you; To you, who are a very God to Varius, Who can at once forgive, and cure my Weakness. BRUTUS. But only by Despair: without that help, There is no God himself can give you ease: A sharp, I must confess, but certain Cure. Our Stoical Philosophy instructs us, A wise Man is above the reach of Jove, Yet hardly 'scapes the worst of Demons, Love. But since good Junia's Soul is firm as Fate, Be yours so too. What helps it to be learn'd? Or to be wise in Bus'ness of the World? Nay, where would be the good to rule that World, Without an inward Pow'r to govern Passion? The Man disturb'd within, is but a Player; May act abroad, perhaps, some Hero's Part, But sinks at home, a low, uneasy Slave. VARIUS. To teach is easy; but to learn is hard. As well might Heav'nly Socrates infuse His own wise Temper while he taught his Morals, As Brutus raise my Soul to equal his. BRUTUS. Be not so modest, Varius, nor so courtly; Brutus is not your Mistress, but your Friend. The Roman Virtue shines so bright in you, Nothing is wanting to make up Perfection But your Command o'er this unfruitful Passion. Love, ev'n when most successful, makes not happy. Sometimes indeed, Pleasure beyond expression Possesses all at once both Mind and Body, Confounding Soul and Sense with height of Rapture. But what. Allays o'erbalance all this Joy! Frequent Disquiets, Doubts, and Jealousies; Sometimes the Pains of Absence, and sometimes Amidst the Bliss, a dismal Dread to lose it. At best, the Pleasure is but intermitting, While the uneasy Fever never ceases. But Love, when slighted, is intolerable: Who courts the fairest Tyrant, is a Fool, And lives a Martyr in the meanest Cause. VARIUS. Enough, enough, I am already cur'd, At least, till Junia is beheld again. BRUTUS. 'Tis half a Cure in Love to wish for one. Give me your Hand, you'll march with me to Morrow; Where you will drown your Sighs in Sounds of War, And turn your tend'rest Thoughts on your poor Country. (Exeunt Brutus and Varius.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Second CHORUS. Of Athenian Youths and Virgins. By Mr. POPE. YOUTHS. O Tyrant Love! hast thou possest The prudent, learn'd, and virtuous Breast? Wisdom and Wit in vain reclaim, And Arts but soften us to feel thy Flame. Varius with Blushes owns he loves, And Brutus tenderly reproves. Why, Virtue, dost thou blame Desire, Which Nature has imprest? Why, Nature, dost thou soonest fire The mild and gen'rous Breast? VIRGINS. Love's purer Flames the Gods approve; The Gods, and Brutus bend to Love: Brutus for absent Portia sighs, And sterner Cassius melts at Junia's Eyes. What is loose Love? A wand'ring Fire, A transient Fit of fond Desire. But Hymen's Flames like Stars unite, And burn for ever one; Chaste, as cold Cynthia's Virgin Light, Productive as the Sun. YOUTHS. What various Joys on One attend, As Son, as Father, Husband, Friend? Whether his hoary Sire he spies, And finds a thousand grateful Thoughts arise, Or meets his Spouse's fonder Eye, Or views his smiling Progeny; What tender Passions take theit turns? What home-felt Raptures move? His Heart now melts, now leaps, now burns, With Rev'rence, Hope, and Love. CHORUS of Both. Hence guilty Joys, Distastes, Surmises, False Oaths, false Tears, Deceits, Disguises, Dangers, Doubts, Delays, Surprises, (Fires that scorch, yet dare not shine) Purest Love's unwasting Treasure, Constant Faith, fair Hope, long Leisure, Days of Ease, and Nights of Pleasure, Sacred Hymen! these are thine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. In the same Vestibule. Enter Brutus, Junia, Lucilius. LUCILIUS. A messenger express arriv'd from Rome, Is entring mournfully the Palace Gates; And, as he passes, weeping all the way. BRUTUS. My Mind forbodes; speak, is my Portia well? Enter Messenger, who gives a Letter to Brutus. MESSENGER. She is, Sir. BRUTUS. Then I hope to bear the worst. âMy Duty forces me to send you News, (Reads. âWhich, tho' you needs must know, I grieve to write. âTwo hundred of the noblest Rank in Rome âProscrib'd, and murder'd: Cicero himself âGiv'n up by false Octavius to his Foes. Good Heav'ns! to whom do ye dispose Mankind? (Drops the Letter. Sad Fate indeed; so great a Villany Is most surprising, tho' 'tis done by them. (Weeps. JUNIA. Dismal indeed! but oh my dearest Brother, Let not your tender Mind be too much touch'd; Practise that Patience which you now taught me. Cassius is absent, I am desolate, Yet Rome (you said) must take up all my Thoughts. BRUTUS. And therefore 'tis for Rome I most lament, At once depriv'd of her most worthy Sons! Those Sons are to be envy'd, not bemoan'd; Most noble Suff'rers in their Country's Cause! Great Cicero lives still, shall live for ever; While Men can read, or value Worth or Learning. But Rome her self appears all pale before me, Gushing out Tears, and wringing helpless Hands; Rome, Rome has lost her best, her purest Blood! (Weeps again. JUNIA. Brutus, be cheer'd: her vital Parts remain; In you and Cassius flows the Roman Spirit, That still inspires whole Armies on her Side. LUCILIUS. 'Tis nobly, truly said; and you bright Junia Possess a Soul, tho' in a softer Frame, Lofty enough to animate ev'n them. BRUTUS. She does, Lucilius; and were Portia here, (But I alas shall never be so happy) Cassius and I should be but Followers Of them in the defence of Liberty But oh, my Cicero! who speaks thy Praise, Must have a Tongue like thine, beyond the Bounds Of Roman Eloquence; and fit to fill The Mouth of Fame with never-dying Sounds. JUNIA. How could Octavius consent to lose him, The best, as well as wisest of his Friends? BRUTUS. Ambition over-eager, checks at nothing; A goodly, but a dang'rous Bird of Prey; Flies at all Game, and never to be tam'd, She pecks, and tears the Hand on which she sits. I often warn'd good Tully of his Danger; But all in vain, when Heav'n will have it so. He wish'd himself with us at CÃ¦sar's Death, And heartily, I doubt not; tho' his Foes Suspected his too soft and tender Nature. SCENE II. Enter some Lictors, bringing in Theodotus with them bound as a Prisoner. LICTOR. We have discovered here Theodotus, Odious to all Mankind for Pompey's Death. JUNIA. What, he that made a formal Speech for Murder? And with a Philosophick Gravity Sanctify'd Mischief with a rev'rend Tongue? The Orator wants Words in his own Cause. BRUTUS. Speak for thy self; that Justice thou shalt have. THEODOTUS. Had I not often own'd my Crime with Tears, So self-condemn'd already; or if Brutus Were not my Judge, the good, the faultless Brutus; Black tho' I now appear, and all disfigur'd With common Prejudice; yet I might give Fair colour to this hated, foul Offence. But who can stand the Test of strictest Justice? Or how can words avail to sway the Wise? This Wisdom and this Justice are in Brutus: So much superior thou to other Men, That at thy Judgment-seat, the greatest Art Is useless to excuse the smallest Fault. BRUTUS. Say boldly all thou can'st. THEODOTUS. Else, I might say, 'tis hard to be condemn'd For doing that, which if I had not done, I might have justly been condemn'd by those Who summon'd me to Council for their Safety. I thought their Safety ask'd for Pompey's Death: Oh that I could redeem it with my own! Pompey was great, was good, was wise, was valiant, But yet was vanquish'd by more happy CÃ¦sar; Who, had his Foe been spar'd, would soon have shewn A real Rage, which now he but affected. Could Egypt stop the Victor of Pharsalia? All we could give was but a poor Reprieve, A hardship worse than Death to Minds resolv'd. Rome and her Liberty entirely lost, Pompey would have disdain'd a Life precarious, Which yet had cost our King and Country dear. Would he had counsell'd, and would I had dy'd! For he, who as a Roman, dy'd for Rome; If born with us, would have advis'd for Egypt JUNIA. With all thy Guilt, how durst thou name great Pompey THEODOTUS. Ev'n he was guilty once, and slew your Father. Yet, grant he was the bravest, best of Men, Victorious often in the Cause of Rome, While I was but a Counsellor for Egypt. Since Fame rewards his Service to his Country, Should I be punish'd for assisting mine? BRUTUS. If Words could change the nature of ill Deeds, Thy Head would be indebted to thy Tongue, Which, I must needs allow, has done its part, And makes my tender Nature wish thee hence, Out of my Reach, as well as Will, to punish. But here I stand the Substitute of Rome; Which with united Sighs bemoans her Pompey, And weeping waits to have his Death reveng'd. Thy worthless Prince and Country were too slight A Sacrifice to Pompey! At his Feet CÃ¦sar himself was not too great to fall: Think but on that, and thou wilt dye content. (Exeunt Lucilius and Officers with Theodotus. 'Twere barbarous to reason with a Wretch Long since condemn'd to dye by Rome's Decree. But he was no Egyptian, as he pleaded; Nor subject to that Prince he so advis'd. JUNIA. What King or Country dares be so audacious To hurt the meanest Senator of Rome? How then durst any think of killing Pompey? BRUTUS. Presumptuous Wickedness! Pompey o'ercome, Abandon'd by his Friends, a Fugitive, At mercy of the meanest, basest Villain; Yet in that lowest Ebb was much too high For such a Prince as Ptolemy to reach. From Ptolemy, prostrate at Pompey's Feet, Not only Aid, but Reverence was due. That Chief escaping, might have chang'd Rome's Fate; And the whole World had been oblig'd to Egypt. SCENE III. Enter Lucilius. LUCILIUS. Base Villany is seldom at a stand, But still proceeding on to greater Mischief: From murd'ring Senators at Rome, they now Lift their aspiring Treachery to Brutus. The wise Athenians, watchful of your Safety, Have newly seiz'd a Slave in foul Disguise; Who on the Rack confesses all the Crime. âHie thee to Athens (said the base Octavius) âAnd save thy Master, save us all, save Rome, âGo purchase Fame and Freedom by a Blow: âOur Foes are all united in that Brutus; âHe, he alone inspir'd the Death of CÃ¦sar. âBe desperate, be secret, and be rich. BRUTUS. I pity the poor Wretch; he knows no better. At his Return, how would his Master grieve To find me safer here, than he at Rome. He does but shoot these Arrows in the Air. LUCILIUS. Except at Rome infected by our Foes, Virtue like yours, is ev'ry where secure, And claims the just Protection of Mankind. JUNIA. Your Life is so important, Youths quit their Pleasures, Soldiers slight their Pay, Ev'n Misers leave their Wealth to watch your Safety BRUTUS. Let go the Slave to tell Octavius this. LUCILIUS. What, save that Wretch? BRUTUS. Both save, and let him go. In this Attempt he but obey'd his Master. (Exit Lucilius. Oh that there were no Romans worse than he! This Slave would kill; but 'tis to get his Freedom! But ah! ev'n Senators are growing Slaves, Careless of Honour, void of Honesty, Forgetting all their noble Ancestors, And ruining a glorious Commonwealth! Enter Titinius and Lucilius again. TITINIUS. Cassius has sent me here with this Reply, He wants that Gold himself, which you would borrow; Of which, at meeting, you shall have account. These Letters I have brought for noble Junia. (Junia goes out with the Letters. LUCILIUS. Your Legions then must stay till his are paid. BRUTUS. Think not the worst, Lucilius, e'er it comes. At Sardis we shall meet by break of Day. I'll take one Hour's repose, and then for Sardis. Good Night to both. LUCILIUS. Rest to your noble Thoughts. (Exeunt. SCENE IV. Brutus remains, laid on his Couch BRUTUS. 'Tis but in vain, Sleep is not to be courted. Sing, Boy, the Song that Portia likes so well, And sooth my Thoughts with some melodious Sounds. (Soft Musick and Song. Man is himself an Instrument of Musick; But yet some String is always out of Tune, And ev'ry Sound we make shews our Confusion. Why should this Death of CÃ¦sar trouble me? I did it not for Anger, or Ambition; But for mere Honesty, and Publick Good; Nay, Good to him; for in my own Opinion, 'Tis better much to dye, than live unjustly My Fellow Citizens, my Kindred, Friends, All sunk at once beneath his rising Fortune. And should I tamely suffer an Usurper T'enslave Mankind, because he smiles on me? Friendship indeed is the most tempting Bribe; But Justice should be blind to all its Beauty. And yet a Restlesness attends such Deeds, Tho' ne'er so just: something that feels unwieldy, That sits uneasy on a gentle Nature I cannot sleep, unless I shake it off. SCENE V. Enter a Spirit in the Shape of CÃ¦sar, full of Wounds. [BRUTUS] Sure I sleep now, or else my Eyes delude me: I know 'tis Fancy all; and yet I stagger; Ha, it comes on. What art thou? When alive, Tho' arm'd with Pow'r, adorn'd with Fame and Greatness, I fear'd thee not, because thou wert unjust; But, more than human now, thou seem'st above me! Speak, unknown Being! I conjure thee, speak. SPIRIT. I am thy Evil Genius, Marcus Brutus, And have assum'd this Shape, to give thee Terror. BRUTUS. Terror? How cam'st thou to know Me no better? Sure thou art ignorant, as well as evil. SPIRIT. Is Murder then no Crime? BRUTUS. Killing is none; When done not for our selves, but for our Country? SPIRIT. Not for your self indeed; you stab'd your Friend. BRUTUS. Friend? Oh, thou touchest now my tender part! Oh, name that word no more! SPIRIT. A Friend! a Friend! BRUTUS. But what's a Friend, compar'd with Publick Good? Convince me, if thou can'st: Oh, teach me Truth! And shew me but one glimpse of future Being, Of which we talk so much, yet know so little! Dispel these Mists that muffle poor Mankind, And open to me all that glorious Scene! Shew me where Virtue smiles, and sits enthron'd, And where Morality finds just Reward; 'Tis sure, above: for ill Men prosper here. SPIRIT. Soon at Philippi thou shalt know it all. BRUTUS. Shall we then meet again? SPIRIT. Yes, at Philippi. BRUTUS. I'll meet thee there. I'll meet thee any where. (Exit Spirit. Now I am resolute, the Shadow flies, And vanishes together with my Fear. What hoa! Enter Boy. My Lord; BRUTUS. Did you see nothing? BOY. No. BRUTUS. Nor hear me speak? BOY. Nothing at all, my Lord. BRUTUS. Let every thing be ready for our March; And call me up, be sure, by break of Day. Till then I'll sleep within. (Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Third CHORUS. Of Roman Senators. I. Dark is the Maze poor Mortals tread; Wisdom it self a Guide will need: We little thought when CÃ¦sar bled, That a worse CÃ¦sar would succeed. And are we under such a Curse, We cannot change, but for the worse? II. With fair Pretence of Foreign Force, By which Rome must her self enthrall; These, without Blushes or Remorse, Proscribe the best, impov'rish all. The Gauls themselves, our greatest Foes Could act no Mischiefs worse than those. III. That Julius, with ambitious Thoughts, Had Virtues too, his Foes could find; These equal him in all his Faults, But never in his noble Mind. That Free-born Spirits shou'd obey Wretches, who know not how to sway! IV Late we repent our hasty Choice, In vain bemoan so quick a Turn. Heark all to Rome's united Voice! Better that we a while had born Ev'n all those Ills which most displease, Than sought a Cure far worse than the Disease.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. A Field near Philippi, where Cassius and Brutus made the Rendezvous of their Armies. Enter Brutus and Officers. BRUTUS. 'Tis here that I and Cassius were to join: What say our Scouts? Is any Army near? OFFICER. The rising Dust discovers their Approach; And some, impatient of so slow a March, Are just arriv'd before to meet their Friends. Enter Lucilius. BRUTUS. O, here's Lucilius, whom I sent to Cassius. LUCILIUS. Cassius, my Lord, salutes the noble Brutus. And hastens to embrace him. BRUTUS. O Lucilius! Cassius is alter'd much, or ill advis'd; Has, I am loth to say it, done some things Which do not well become so great a Man. But, since he is so near, I'll stay my Censure, And wish to find my Jealousy mistaken. But, good Lucilius, how did he receive you, When you brought friendly notice I was near? LUCILIUS. With Forms, and Complements, and great Respect, Out-doing Enemies in Ceremony; But no Familiarity betwixt us; None of that free and friendly Conference Which we have us'd of old: and when he nam'd you, 'Twas always with such set, affected Praise, As if the Commendation had no meanin But to be told again. BRUTUS. I am afraid Thou judgest but too right: Nothing is nobler Than Friendship, till it once begins to fail; But then asham'd, and conscious of Defect, It hides itself in Complement and Care: At the first shock, off falls the frail Disguise; Falshood is foolish, and betrays it self. There is no Art in plain and friendly Truth, Which like the Sun shines forth by its own Light. Violent Minds sometimes make glorious shew, Like Gilding shine, equal to real Gold, But in the usage, how much difference! Hark! he's arriv'd; march gently on to meet him. SCENE II. Enter Cassius, &amp;c. CASSIUS. Embracing thus is but a thing of Form, For 'tis not fit that both our Armies here Should once suspect the least Dispute between us. BRUTUS. The common Cause indeed requires our Care, And all our Discontents should yield to that. CASSIUS. Brutus, let us retire into my Tent, Lest here by chance some unbecoming word Break out too loud. BRUTUS. Are we so little Masters of our selves? How can we then be fit to govern Armies? CASSIUS. You think your self above those common Frailties. BRUTUS. The Stoics are above unruly Passion. But, since you would retire, I am content My Soldiers may remove beyond those Fields. Lucilius, march a little off this Ground. Let your Men do the like, under pretence Of our conferring about great Affairs; Indeed our greatest; for a Home-dispute Is of more consequence than foreign Dangers. CASSIUS. Titinius, let my Forces move away To yonder Plain, and leave us all alone, 'Tis necessary we should be in private. (Exeunt all, except Brutus and Cassius. SCENE III. CASSIUS. You ask'd me fifty Talents for your Legions, And in a Style as to your Treasurer, As if I should prefer your's to my own Am I to be impos'd on thus by you? BRUTUS. Sure Cassius little knows the force of Friendship? Writing so freely shew'd my Trust and Kindness. He that desires a Favour from a Friend, Does him the greatest in desiring it. CASSIUS. Come, I must tell you, over-great Applause Lifts you too high. Should I, who kill'd ev'n CÃ¦sar, Only for his excessive Power and Pride, Should I at last submit thus to another? From a Superiour my Stars defend me BRUTUS. From a Superiour? you little know me: I scarce would be Superiour to my Slaves, Except in Virtue; that is worthy Pride. CASSIUS. Then think not Sir, of being above me. BRUTUS. I wish I were not, by these weak Suspicions. What, jealous of a Friend? it moves my Pity. CASSIUS. Pity? I scorn it. BRUTUS. Scorn your Rage that moves it. My Pity is not, ought not, to be slighted: 'Tis like the kind Compassion of a Parent, Full of Concern, and free from all Contempt, Rather deserves your Thanks than your Reproach. CASSIUS. My Thanks? for what? for domineering o'er me? BRUTUS. Yet Reason has some right to govern Passion. CASSIUS. Brutus, you have an over-ruling way, Which, under colour of a patient Calmness, Expects Complyance with your gentle Temper. But I see through it. BRUTUS. See? your Passion blinds you. CASSIUS. You have no Passion, yet provoke another's. BRUTUS. Is it provoking to inform a Brother Of Faults no other dares presume to tell him, And yet most necessary he should know? Your Troops have done most dismal Outrages; Forc'd harmless Wretches from their native Homes, Slighted the Widows and the Orphans Tears, Gather'd their last Remains with greedy Gripe; That which poor Swains had labour'd for whole Years, Is in one Moment plunder'd by your Soldiers. This sinks our Cause, which rose at first so glorious. Shall we, who soar'd so high in Reputation, And open'd ev'ry Mouth in our just Praises, Now on a sudden fall to dire Oppression? Shall we at last pull down with our own Hands That lofty Fabrick of well-founded Honour? CASSIUS. Am I to answer for it? BRUTUS. With your Fame; That stands expos'd to ev'ry just Man's Censure. CASSIUS. Go on no more, I will no longer bear it. BRUTUS. By Heav'n you shall hear all; then do your worst. Dare I not say whatever you dare act? Am I not equally concern'd with you In this great War for Freedom of our Country? Yet must not tell whatever hurts our Cause? CASSIUS. Tempt me no farther, Sir, you may repent it. BRUTUS. Tempt not you me with all your furious Looks: I am above your Threats, and can look down Both on your self and them. CASSIUS. Were it not for the Cause we have in hand, I would not bear this heap of Injuries. BRUTUS. I injure? where is that unlucky Man Who can with reason make Complaint of me? If any, I'll acknowledge it with Shame. The Man who wrongs his meanest Adversary, Exalts his Enemy above himself. And can you think that I could injure Cassius, My Brother, and my Friend? CASSIUS. If hearing Lyes With greedy Ears, and soon believing them; If misinterpreting whate'er I do, And representing things in foulest Colours, Can be call'd wronging, who was e'er so wrong'd? BRUTUS. If I have said one word that sounds unkindly, My Tongue has slipp'd, and quite deceiv'd my Heart, That melts like Wax before your hottest Anger. Behold my Tears for having so much vex'd you. CASSIUS. What says my Brutus? speak that word again, Am I not then so full, so full of Faults? BRUTUS. It was my Frailty to presume so much. CASSIUS. And mine to be suspicious of my Brutus. All shall be mended. BRUTUS. But can you forgive Too sharp Expressions, tho' with kind intent? CASSIUS. So kind intent, I own the Obligation. No Man but Brutus durst have spoke so boldly; No Man but Brutus would have spoke so kindly. BRUTUS. Oh Cassius, nothing but the tendrest Friendship, And when I thought it for the Publick Good, Could have embolden'd me to censure you. CASSIUS. Embrace me close, and witness how my Heart Leaps up transported with this sudden Change! BRUTUS. It was an eager Argument indeed, But ends as it should do between such Friends, Resenting nothing but their Country's Wrongs. Methinks good Spirits hov'ring all around us, Should to the World proclaim our happy Union, Now, while our Enemies combine in Mischief. Thus firmly join'd, we'll first be Conquerors, Then make all Rome contented as our selves. SCENE IV. Enter Lucilius and Titinius. CASSIUS. Come in Lucilius, welcome good Titinius. Let us consult of our Necessities, And manage well this last important Stake. BRUTUS. The State is thus at Rome: My Letter mentions Full fifty Senators, with thousands more, Newly proscrib'd; and Cicero is one. CASSIUS. Cicero one? that talking Friend of CÃ¦sar? Octavius has well paid him for his pains; May ill Men ever use each other so. BRUTUS. Oh gently censure ev'n a Foe when dead. See, Cassius, here the Curse of over-caution. The wary Walker who mistrusts too much, Treads not so firm, but faintly, and so stumbles: Thus Tully fell, by too much fear of falling. CASSIUS. But Antony, and young Octavius Are marching hither with a mighty Force: The useless Lepidus is left at Rome. BRUTUS. The question is, whether we had not best Haste on, with Anger bent against our Foes, Rather than tamely wait their bold Assault. CASSIUS. I am for staying here: my Reason this. So long a March must weary out our Strength, Which Rest will give us here. Let them come on, And tir'd with Toil expose their bending Bodies Under our lusty Arms, vig'rous and fresh: Besides, in this we take the stoutest part; For, resolute expecting certain Danger Shews the most settled Courage; while the Coward Runs often fiercely on, to shun his Fear, And swallow down in haste the bitter Draught. BRUTUS. Some Reasons have a strange fallacious Force; Just as the pleasing Colours us'd by Artists Delude the very Sight. But in my Judgment, It tires our Army more to tarry here. Opinion is the Soul of every Action; Keep but that up, that keeps up all the rest: And 'tis maintain'd by marks of Resolution, By rushing on the Foe, forcing to fight, Not lingring here behind with slacken'd Vigour. We must depend upon our Zeal and Cause, And therefore in hot Blood shall do it best. If once we cool, their surer Discipline Will soon prevail against our new-rais'd Force. The Hearts of all our Soldiers now are set On fierce encountring, all their Rage inflam'd; There's nothing wanting but to draw their Swords, And down goes Tyranny, to rise no more. Can we sit still, and pause with such a Thought? So near a glorious Deed there's no Repose: Impatience makes unquiet Expectation, And eager Nature can allow no Rest. CASSIUS. You shall prevail; we'll let 'em but refresh, And then we'll charge the Foe. BRUTUS. Let us embrace; and, O my dearest Brother, This Quarrel shall but make us better Friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fourth CHORUS. Of Roman Soldiers. Our Vows thus chearfully we sing, While martial Musick fires our Blood Let all the neighb'ring Echoes ring With Clamours for our Country's Good: And, for Reward, of the just Gods we claim A Life with Freedom, or a Death with Fame. May Rome be freed from War's Alarms, And Taxes heavy to be born; May she beware of foreign Arms, And send them back with noble Scorn: And, for Reward, &amp;c. May she no more confide in Friends, Who nothing farther understood, Than only, for their private ends, To waste her Wealth, and spill her Blood. And, for Reward, &amp;c. Our Senators great Jove restrain From private Piques, they Prudence call; From the low Thoughts of little Gain, And hazarding the losing all. And, for Reward, &amp;c. The shining Arms with haste prepare, Then to the glorious Combat fly; Our Minds unclog'd with farther Care, Except to overcome, or dye. And, for Reward, &amp;c. They fight, Oppression to increase; We, for our Liberties and Laws: It were a Sin to doubt Success, When Freedom is the noble Cause. And, for Reward, of the just Gods we claim A Life with Freedom, or a Death with Fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Field of Philippi. Brutus, Cassius, Lucilius and Titinius, with other Officers, at the Head of their Army. Enter Varius hastily. VARIUS. Propitious Stars favour our Cause already. Behold! a heedless Party of Octavius Hast'ning too fast, is fall'n within our Ambush; And we may cut them off without Defence. CASSIUS. Fall on 'em instantly. BRUTUS. Hold, Cassius, hold, And spare your Fellow-Citizens at Mercy. CASSIUS. The Death of these will make the Day our own. BRUTUS. 'Twill rather make the rest more desperate. Consider, Cassius, they are Romans all. CASSIUS. So much the worse, fighting against their Country. BRUTUS. Alas, they do but follow wicked Leaders, And are our Countrymen with all their Faults; Kindred, nay Friends, perhaps to thee, or me. CASSIUS. Thy tender Nature will undo us all. BRUTUS. Good Cassius, let me over-rule in this, And you in all things else shall govern me. Order our Soldiers not to kill a Man, (To Lucilius. But seize them gently, as your future Friends. Oh, Cassius, what a Pleasure 'tis to save Romans from falling in a shameful Cause. CASSIUS. I can no longer contradict my Brutus, Your Mercy is so moving; yet I own This Battel never was approv'd by me: For I would ne'er have ventur'd at one Blow So great a Stake as all our Liberties; But rather have prolong'd th' important War. I use to slight Presages; but of late, My Mind, I know not how, foreboding Ill, Spite of my Reason feels a drooping Sadness, And by its gloomy Light foresees Misfortune. BRUTUS. In such a Cause it were a Fault to fear; Else, Cassius, I might have some Fancies too. For CÃ¦sar's Ghost appear'd to me last Night, At all his gaping Wounds breathing Revenge; And when I would have reason'd with it, vanish'd. CASSIUS. Alas good Brutus, what can be in that, But an effect of melancholy Fumes? A dark and dismal Picture, lively drawn By dreaming Fancy, tho' we think we wake? Our Sect believes no Spirits; if there be, At least, if they are such as Plato fansies, Those purer Beings who behold our Cause, Those Demi-gods will sure encourage Virtue, And give their Fellow Creatures just Assistance. Thus in the midst of Slaughter we shall find Ten thousand airy Legions on our Side, Sent to our Aid, as Heav'n's Auxiliaries. Enter Lucilius, with an Officer of the other Army. LUCILIUS. My Lord, your gen'rous Orders were obey'd, And see the just Success! This worthy Tribune, Won by your Mercy to those other Soldiers, Is come to join us with a valiant Band, Vowing they never will be Foes to Brutus. OFFICER. Such Virtue needs no Army to support it; It vanquishes beyond the reach of Force, And makes our very Minds yield due Submission. BRUTUS. Submission only should be paid to Heav'n, And I must blush to hear it from a Roman. We scarce have in this little Span of Life Sufficient time for exercise of Virtue; We should do ill to lose the least Occasion. Let all his Cohort charge with our chief Legion. Such a Desertion is a timely Service. OFFICER. Your Approbation is our highest Aim. And this Day we'll deserve it. BRUTUS. 'Tis not doubted: Your Country's Freedom will excite your Valour. Let him have Rank among our chief Commanders. (Exit Officer with Varius and Titinius. SCENE II. Manent Cassius and Brutus. CASSIUS. The Fight is well begun, most noble Brutus. And may the rest be still so favourable, That we may lengthen out our Lives to Age, In all the peaceful Joys of Love and Friendship. But, since the Chance of War is most uncertain, 'Tis Wisdom to provide against the worst; Which is, our Parting, if we lose the Battel, Never to meet again: In such a Case What is my dearest Friend resolv'd to do? BRUTUS. I am, alas, so weary of a World, All full of Faults and Follies, I would leave it: But that to me it seems a Want of Spirit To shrink from Life for fear of future ill. 'Tis to distrust the Justice of the Gods, Or else their Pow'r; and is in my Opinion, Not Courage, but a bold Disguise for Fear. With Patience arm'd, I'll bear the Blows of Fortune. CASSIUS. Then dearest Brutus, you can be content To wear a Chain; nay what is yet much worse To see great Rome as much a Slave as you? BRUTUS. Oh never, never come that fatal Day! The very Sound offends. Oh you have nam'd The only thing, ye Gods, I cannot bear. Whene'er ye send that Summons, 'tis my last. And therefore, lest we ne'er should meet again, Here let us take our everlasting Leave. CASSIUS. For ever, and for ever, farewel Brutus! After this famous Day we shall be Victor, Or else, beyond the sense of being vanquish'd. BRUTUS. For ever, and for ever, farewel Cassius! 'Twill be with Pleasure if we meet hereafter; If not, this Parting is our greatest Pain. (Exeunt severally. SCENE III. Just as Cassius is going off, enter Titinius hastily, and stops him. TITINIUS. The Army of Marc Antony appears, Fearless, and forward to attempt your Camp. CASSIUS. Sure 'tis impossible: Tho' brave to Rashness, He is a Soldier of too great Experience; I cannot hope for such a Fault in him. 'Tis safer to bestride the angry Ocean, Than offer to assault a Roman Camp. We'll soon correct this insolent Antonius, And crush the bold Attempt. (Exit Cassius. A Charge is sounded. Re-enter Cassius, with Titinius, Pindarus, and other Officers. CASSIUS. Their prosp'rous Rashness terrifies our Men, Who never fear'd before: I doubt all's lost; The Liberty of Rome is gone for ever. I'll perish with it, or redeem the Day. Titinius, oh make haste, fly tow'rd those Troops; Discover quickly if they are our Friends. (Exit Titinius. Go, Pindarus, get on the rising Ground, (My Sight thou know'st is short) and take a view Quite round the Field. Pindarus goes up the Hill, then calls to Cassius. PINDARUS. Hoa, my good Lord! CASSIUS. What now? PINDARUS. Titinius is seiz'd on by the Foe. CASSIUS. Oh, he is taken, and they shout for Joy. (Cassius goes also to view. Come down, come down; Oh, I have liv'd to see my best Friend lost! And by my own Procurement! Pindarus, I took thee Pris'ner once, and spar'd thy Life; All the return I ask, is, now take mine. (Pindarus turns away weeping I am thy General, and Master too; Yet I have us'd thee as becomes a Friend. A Friend will not deny my last Request. Kill me with this; with this I slew the Tyrant. (Cassius presents him his Dagger PINDARUS. Is there Necessity? CASSIUS. Thou see'st there is. Dispatch it quickly, while I turn my Face. PINDARUS. Then farewel worthy Cassius. (Pindarus kills himself. CASSIUS. What, gone before me? Did I need Example? For shame now Cassius do thy own last work; Pindarus leads the Honourable Way. (Falls on his Sword. SCENE IV. Enter Titinius, meeting one of Cassius's Officers just entring at the other Door. TITINIUS. Brutus with chearful News greets Caius Cassius; And, having broke the Forces of Octavius, Is hasting hither to relieve his Friend. OFFICER. Alas, he comes too late, see there lies Cassius! Enter Brutus with Officers. BRUTUS. Is Cassius on the Ground? O my dear Friend! (Runs to Cassius. I came to fill thy Ears with pleasing News; But such a Sight has turn'd my Joy to Grief CASSIUS. What, has my feeble Hand made me be taken? Is Cassius to become the Scorn of Antony? (Rising a little, believing it to be Antony. BRUTUS. Rather the Grief of ev'ry worthy Roman. What cursed Hand has slain my dearest Friend? CASSIUS. What do I hear, and see? is Brutus there? A Pris'ner too? BRUTUS. The Gods forbid that, Cassius: Look up, and see thy mournful Friend victorious. CASSIUS. Have you then sav'd the Liberty of Rome? I ask no more, and dye with full Content. But yet I leave my Junia behind: Oh, still be tender of that best of Women! In being kind to her, remember me. (Dyes in his Arms. BRUTUS. Remember thee? Who can forget thy Worth! With a dead Friend Disputes are all forgot, And what is tender takes up all the Mind; Grief only thinks on that which most promotes it: (Turns to his Officers. And oh, I long to give my Sorrow vent. But our dear Countrey now claims all my Care. Summon our Soldiers, that I may with Praise Keep up that Spirit which has fir'd their Souls. Enter a confused Multitude of Soldiers. Hail Fellow-Soldiers, worthy of that Cause For which you fight so well. Your Actions past Urge you to more: Be your own great Example. On far unequal Terms these Armies meet; They fight, to make Ambition Tyranny, And themselves Slaves; their Vict'ry is their Ruin. But if for this one Day you can submit To one who but commands you for your sakes; (Now proud to lead, while you are pleas'd to follow) You ev'ry one shall be a Conqueror, And equal to your General, who seeks No other Triumph but his Country's Freedom. End but that Work, and then to foreign Wars. There's no Man here but may by Merit hope To lead an Army, and have Me his Soldier. Acclamations of Applause. Let prodigal Antonius promise Treasures, Wrench'd from hard Hands of wretched lab'ring Swains, Who lift them up to Heav'n to call down Vengeance. I can out-bid him, spite of all his Riches: Hark to the pleasing Sound! 'tis Liberty! That only nam'd, I need to say no more. (Exeunt Soldiers shouting. SCENE V. A Trumpet sounds mournfully. BRUTUS. Silence those dismal Notes for Cassius' Death; There is no need of Sounds to raise true Sorrow; And it will chear the Foe to hear us mourn. Oh Cassius! what a Loss art thou to Rome! (Stooping down to the dead Body. Trumpet sounds again mournful. Enter Varius. VARIUS. 'Tis with a trembling Hand I shew these Letters; Your Grief for Cassius, will alas, be lost: Like Rivers in the Ocean, swallow'd up In sadder News. BRUTUS. Speak, is my Portia well? What, make no Answer? then 'tis so indeed. In saying nothing, thou hast told me all. VARIUS. Here is the sad Account. (Holds the Letter to Brutus. BRUTUS. Oh, read it, read it. VARIUS. âVarius, I must unwillingly inform you, (Reading. âThat Portia, grieving for her Husband's Absence, âHad mourn'd her self into a raging Fever; âIn which, because she fansy'd he was dead, âShe (none suspecting) swallow'd burning Coals, âSo dy'd with mournful Clamours for her Brutus. BRUTUS. Enough, enough. O ye immortal Gods! I'll not complain of you, but of my self; For, sure I am the very worst of Men, Since you think fit to make me the most wretched. How all my Tears are on a sudden stopt! Something I feel within that weighs me down; And I must sink. VARIUS. Good Sir be comforted. BRUTUS. Oh never, never. Had'st thou beheld her with my weeping Eyes, When tenderly we took our latest leave; How her Love pleaded, and her Beauty mov'd; When, all dissolv'd in Grief, her mournful Looks She fix'd on mine! Oh, never talk of Comfort. Comfort! dear Portia, if I ever seek it, May thenâalas! I cannot curse my self, Heav'n knows, I am already so unhappy. Enter Lucilius hastily. LUCILIUS. The Enemy once more is coming on, Antony leads them out of Cassius' Camp, And gathers, as he goes, the large Remains Of the new routed Army of Octavius. I'll do my best to stop them in their March. BRUTUS. Antonius, and his Army? Alas Varius; What's that, or Victory itself to me? VARIUS. But yet our Country should not be forgotten. BRUTUS. Oh, no: I'll bear about this heavy Heart: Yet, when I struggle most, it weighs me down. VARIUS. But where is, Sir, your wonted Resolution? BRUTUS. Gone, Varius, gone for ever, with my Portia. VARIUS. Then, farewel all the Liberty of Rome! BRUTUS. The Liberty of Rome? The thought of that Has rous'd me upâYet one Sigh more for Portiaâ Rome yet shall have my Cares: But oh, my Friend, May this be the last Battel among Romans! It grieves my Soul to see this Civil Slaughter. Fain I would live to leave my Country free, And with my dying Eyes behold her prosper. Else I have done too much; and CÃ¦sar's Death, Too sharp a Med'cine, if it does not cure. 'Twas cutting off a Limb ev'n from my self, And, oh, I now begin to feel the Maim. But 'tis too late, and we must now look forwardsâ Command our Men to spread on both the Wings, Lest they encompass us with greater Numbers: The Troops we routed of Octavius Will hardly have the heart to rally more. (Exeunt. After they have sounded a Battel for some time, enter Lucilius and another Officer. LUCILIUS. All's lost! Ambition triumphs over Virtue: OFFICER. 'Tis not our Fault, but Fate's: Did we not charge With Fierceness fit to fight for all the World? First, all our Darts we flung away despis'd, Uncertain Weapons of remoter War, And rush'd on nearer with the surer Sword; As if each common Soldier were a Brutus, Rome at their Hearts, and Glory in their Minds. LUCILIUS. But what is Valour, when so overmatch'd, By elder Troops, and much superior Numbers? Yet no one yielded, while ten thousand dy'd; Each call'd for Death as fast as e'er he fell, And still by ill-tim'd Pity was refused. We only fought to dye, and they to save us: Which Brutus then perceiving, left the Field, And fled not from their Fury, but their Mercy. Enter Ventidius with a Company of Soldiers. VENTIDIUS. Pursue them close, and on your Lives spare Brutus. LUCILIUS. Stop then your Chase, and lead me to Antonius. I might have 'scap'd, but Brutus scorns to fly. SOLDIER. He is taken, he's taken. (They give a great Shout, and carry out Lucilius, whom they suppose to be Brutus. (Exeunt Omnes. SCENE VI. Enter Brutus and Titinius with some Officers. BRUTUS. Ye worthy few, who with unusual Faith Quit not a Friend whom Fortune has forsaken; Rest your tir'd Bodies on this Bank a while: Where like a shipwreck'd Merchant I appear, Gath'ring the dear Remains of my lost Fortunes. OFFICER. Oh, who can judge the Councils of the Gods? (They all sit down. Behold the best of Men is made a Prey To boundless Wildness, and unjust Ambition. BRUTUS. That wild Ambition but too often prospers: Yet sure the Gods know better far than we, How to dispose the ruling of Mankind. If they will have (which yet seems wondrous strange) Injustice to succeed, and Virtue suffer; Our Part is only to submit with Reverence. 'Tis time, 'tis time that Rome should be at rest. FIRST OFFICER. (He whispers each of them. Not for the World. SECOND OFFICER. The mighty Gods forbid! THIRD OFFICER. May my Hand wither first! FIRST OFFICER. What did he whisper? THIRD OFFICER. He earnestly intreated me to kill him. FIRST OFFICER. He mov'd the same to me. TITINIUS. How is that noble Soul o'erwhelm'd with Anguish, Not for his own, but for his Country's Ruin! BRUTUS. Romans, for shame shew not such childish Pity. Think you I am so fond of painful Life, (He rises hastily. That my faint Hand should tremble at my Cure? Why then refuse to do this last good Office, Which I, for want of Friends must do my self. Nay, if my Life could yet but serve my Country, Tho rack'd with Griefs, the very hopes of that, Would, like strong Cordials, force me to endure it. But lawless Empire rules! what then remains But Death, or worse than Death, ignoble Bondage? Which if my Soul can ne'er submit to bear, Pardon, good Heav'n, my not enduring Life On such a hard Condition!âSacred Virtue! Thou Deity that all the Good adore! Why hast thou cast me off, and giv'n Success To thy own Foes, and mine? I follow'd thee Ev'n through the Blood of CÃ¦sar, whom I lov'd, And who lov'd me; Ye Pow'rs immortal! know With what a heavy Heart and troubled Mind, I help'd my Country by so harsh a Means: But I most gladly make thee this amendsâ (CÃ¦sar's Ghost appears and vanishes. Oh CÃ¦sar, CÃ¦sar! Therefore rest appeas'd; I did not kill thee half so willingly. (Kills himself. Enter Antony, Dolabella, Ventidius, &amp;c. ANTONY. The Blow is giv'n, and we are come too late. A great Shout of Soldiers bringing in Lucilius. SOLDIER. Rewards, and Triumph! we have brought you Brutus. LUCILIUS. No, Antony: the Gods forbid that Brutus Should ever be a Prisoner! by assuming His Name, I here have stopp'd their hot Pursuit. ANTONY. This is not Brutus, but a worthy Prize: For ye have brought a Friend, and not a Foe. Youth, I admire thy Virtue; be to me, As thou hast been to him who now lies there. Lucilius starts, sees the Body of Brutus, and kneels down by it. Oh Brutus, I am robb'd of half my Triumph; To thy most gen'rous Soul I ow'd my Life, And fain I would have taken kind Revenge; For, 'tis a Debt, lies heavy on me now. Rise, worthy Roman, do not mourn in vain. (Lucilius rises. LUCILIUS. Yield, all ye Heroes of immortal Name, Whose shining Mischiefs only raise your Fame. If publick Virtue well be understood, Here lies the Greatest Man that e'er was Good. DOLABELLA. Yet the just Gods a righteous Judgment send; He lov'd his Country, but he kill'd his Friend.
