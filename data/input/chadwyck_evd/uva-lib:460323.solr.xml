      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Room off the Parliament House in Edinburgh. Livingston solus. The Chancellor and I, once more are friendsâ Can friendship stand which is not built on virtue? No: say the moralistsâthen ours must fall; The mutual trust, the corresponding passions, Requir'd in friendship, center not in us. He cannot bear a rivalâI disdain The thought of parity in place or pow'r. Such are our viewsâOur factions nearly equal, Divide the Stateâshould Douglas join with either, His weight would in a moment turn the scale. He loves not meâTo guard against the worst, I think, the gravest casuist must allow A just precautionâHow the world mistakes! To its misjudging eye the great seem happy: What numbers envy me, and vainly think, The place I hold would make them amply soâ They know thee not Ambition!âto indulge Is but to whet thine appetite the moreâ Happy the humble swain! who views his fields With verdure clad; who sees his flocks encrease: His children rise to ease the load of life; And only hopes for daily bread and peace. The day in healthful exercise employ'd, Adds charms to night; an undisturb'd repose Refits him for the labours of to-morrow; Refresh'd he rises with the early dawn, And to his wonted labour chearly goes; Th'encreasing light, the sun's enliv'ning ray, Inspire his soul with gratitude and joy; Happy, if the long labours of the year, Supply the small demands that nature makes!â How blest is such a state compar'd to mine!â Why did the States confer these trusts on men, Whose equal thirst for rule makes them unfit To act in concert?âCould they see our hearts?â Why rather did we then, why still assume Of Virtue and Humility the semblance?â All would be happyâThat's the general aim Of ev'ry action, and of each resolveâ O that my eye could pierce the cloud that hangs With low'ring aspect on my future days!â If in the book of fate success be wrote, To see the page would be the balm of life; Evil fore-seen, fore-known, were good, compar'd To that which preys upon the anxious mindâ I've heard much of a woman, old and wife, For knowledge of the future greatly fam'dâ Suppose I sent for herâno: 'twere a meanness, And known, would lay me open to reproachâ Suppose, I like a servant went disguis'dâ Still that were meanâ'twere folly, shameful weakness! I'll think of it no more!âThe Chancellor comes!â SCENE II. Crichton, Livingston. Crichton. My good Lord Governour! methinks the sun Shines brighter, now that we are friends again. Livingston. Long may the friendship last, which to my soul Gives real joy, and makes the cares of state Seem an amusement, rather than a toil. Crichton. Have you with due attention thought of that, Last night propos'd, to hold us one forever? Livingston. I have my Lord. The world would blame the deed. Crichton. Perhaps it might: what then? so does it oft Things worthy commendation. Till that house Be humbled, and its dangerous pow'r abridg'd The person of the King's not safe, the State secure, Nor can we call our property our own. For your concerns and mine, what need I say How much we have to fear? These tho' but triffles, When with the publick-good compar'd, deserve Our second care. Livingston. I own they do, my Lord. That he's a dangerous person to the State, I freely grant; but his unrivall'd power, Might turn what we intended as a remedy, To rankest poison. True he loves us not: But were he thus confin'd, the giddy mob, Who right or wrong, are on the suffering side. Would take his part against us; from his friends, His powerful friends, what have we not to fear? Crichton. Nothing at all my Lord: bring down the head, The body falls of course. Secure the chief, And terror dissipates the slavish crowd. Have you forgot the rancour which his father Express'd to both of us? With what contempt He look'd upon us from his height of greatness? Livingston. I never can, my Lord. Crichton. And will the son, Of such a father, ever be our friend? No, no my Lord, that pow'r you seem to dread, Grows daily stronger, and will soon exert Its utmost force to crush the State and us. Admit there's dangerâthe determin'd mind, Thinks not of danger, till the great attempt It meditates be o'er. Our all's at stakeâ What tho' the musty moralist may blame? Success will always vindicate the means. If we pursue the plan I pointed out, My head shall answer for the wish'd success! Livingston. Give me your hand, my Lord! at all events I follow where you lead. Crichton. Henceforth my Lord, Our friends, our foes, our interests are the same. Enter an Usher. Usher. My lords, the States in full convention wait Your entry to the house. Livingston. 'Tis well, we come. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Parliament. Livingston, Crichton, Angus, &amp;c. Livingston. My lords, it gives me pain to hint the cause Of our assembling here; the fell disease That preys upon the vitals of the State, Demands an instant cure; too long delay'd, The spreading evil baffles human skill. The laws contemn'd, authority despis'd, Wild Anarchy with hasty step comes on. Oppression, like a hideous monster, stalks Relentless through the land. Hard on his heels, Unpitying Murder reeks with human gore, Nor fears, nor shuns the sacred light of heav'n. Pale Misery and weeping Sorrow plead, They cannot plead in vainâThe helpless poor Have no resource, my lords, but heav'n and you. Alas! that man, whose debt to social love Can never be repaid, so soon forgets How much he owes, and what he daily needs: Helpless, and weak he comes into the world, And taught by nature, cries aloud for pity; Were this deny'd, the noble plant must feel The bitter frosts of life, and quickly die. Rear'd by the care of others, up it shoots To youth, to manhood, the supporting hand Mean while declining, soon requires the aid It kindly lent, which horrible to tell! Is frequently refus'dâIngrateful man! To moralize is vainâsome sharper remedy Must be apply'd to the distemper'd State; But how, or where begin, that is the question? A question which deserves the last regard. To me my lords, it seems as clear as noon, Those instruments of mischief are set on By some, who envious of their country's peace, Desire to plunge it in intestine broils; By some, whose eminence and pow'r give hopes Of impious protection from the laws. But who are these?âThis is a straitning question, And few perhaps, will chuse to answer it. For me I know notâSome indeed have said, âThe young Lord Douglas, with the court disgusted, âVain of excessive pow'r, and green in years, âProtects those miscreants, and contemns the laws. âThe violation of each social duty, âConnives at in his followers, and presumes âNone dare to call amiss what he approves.â Perhaps the noble youth, with gentle hand, And pitying eye, corrects the faults of some; Perhaps, beset with flatt'rers, he presumes Too much upon his pow'r, and screens a few, For lesser crimes obnoxious to the law. But that a princely youth, to virtue train'd, Would harbour thieves, and murderers, and robbers, Believe who list, no credence I can give it. Tho' this is my opinion, I presume not To say the charge is absolutely false. In times like these, the strangest things fall out; And men succeed not to their fathers virtues. I hope the noble Lord can clear himself; But were he guilty, should he even refuse To stand the test of law; would it be prudent To make a publick breach with him? His pow'r, The numbers he can raise, his tow'ring spirit Impatient of restraint, might throw the State In terrible convulsions. Let me then Humbly propose, a letter from the States Be sent Lord Douglas, to intreat his aid, His personal attendance, and advice. Lest some about him should with ill design Instil distrust, and fill with doubts and fears His generous mind, I think, the States should give Security to overlook the slips The warmth of youthful blood may have occasion'd. Thus far, my lordsâ Crichton. The motion I do second, As equitable in itself, and tending So greatly to the honour of the State. For if the noble Lord be innocent, As possibly he may, by this the world Will be convinc'd, we wish to find him so. If youth and inexperience have occasion'd Some trivial deviations from his duty, The moderation of the States may gain him To love of virtue, and the publick-good. This just respect the publick owes his house, Whose great exploits have oft struck envy dumb, Spread terror in the hearts of Scotland's foes, And made their chiefs, inglorious quit the field. When Edward's hostile arms threw down the bounds Of antient right, and trampled on our laws; When broke by factions, and by numbers aw'd, Our fathers recogniz'd his galling yoke; Fair Liberty, with mien dejected, stood To Douglas' eye reveal'dâhe greatly rose, And singly dar'd to vindicate her claim. Stript of his wide domains, torn from his friends, Coop'd in the narrow limits of a jail; Supported by the Liberty he lov'd, Nor chains, nor death, could move the hero's soul! Methinks I see the God-like man stretch'd out Upon the narrow couch, lift up his head, Collect the small remains of life, and dart To heav'n his last kind wish for Scotland's peace; Smile in the hope, his wish acceptance found, Then greatly die! undaunted, unsubdu'd! That the Chancellor does not here pay a mere compliment to the family of Douglas, the reader may be satisfied, by turning to the first volume of Rapin's History of England, the folio edition, page, 375 where, narrating the transactions of the year 1296, he tells us, that after Edward the first had reduced all Scotland to his obedience, he summoned the whole nobility and officers of the kingdom to assemble at Berwick, and swear fealty to him. The author adds, âAmong the Scotish nobles. William Douglas This William, was the 7th Lord of Douglas, and the father of good sir James. Vid. Hume's History of the Houses of Douglas and Angus. Edition in 12.m o Vol. 1st. page. 30. we the only person, that could never resolve to swear to a prince, who had no right to Scotland, but what force gave him. This refusal drew on him the indignation of Edward, who commanding him to be conducted to England, kept him in close confinement, where he ended his days, without his misfortunes being ever able to bring him to acknowledge Edward for his sovereign.â Livingston. Just is the praise, tho' great, you have bestow'd On the illustrious chiefâTo what we mov'd Do any here object?âMy Lord of Angus?â Angus. The motion has my hearty approbation. (a pause) Livingston. Since all agree, my lords, I humbly move, This letter may be sent before the house Proceeds to other business. If the terms I hinted, be your mind, whom you appoint, May write my Lord of Douglas, in your name. Crichton. On you my Lord, I humbly think, the States Will put the trouble. Angus. None so fit my Lord. (a pause) Livingston. This day, my lords, the letter shall be sent; Mean time, the parliament may be adjourn'd. [Exeunt. The End of the first ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Douglas-Castle. Douglas, Fleming. Fleming , (delivering a Letter) A packet from the Statesâ Douglas. Pray open it. Fleming , (reads) My Lord of Douglas, You have been accused of conniving at several acts of oppression in your dependants, and of protecting others who are obnoxious to the laws. But as these complaints seemed to be founded on vague and uncertain reports, the States have dismist them. It however gives them just concern, that your illustrious house should lie under such foul aspersions; and they earnestly desire your attendance in parliament, as soon as the conveniency of your affairs will permit. The publick disorders that too generally prevail, call aloud for the assistance of every lover of his country; and the States cannot doubt of my Lord of Douglas's readiness to join in every measure for the publick good. That you may have no room to distrust their good intentions, the States hereby engage the publick faith for your absolute security, and promise to overlook whatever may have been amiss in your conduct hitherto. Signed in name, and by appointment of the Estates of Scotland, by Alexander Livingston Regent. Thus far the Statesâ Douglas. Methinks 'tis hard my friend, At once to bear the envy of the great, And the reproach of low malicious tongues. I charge you on our friendship, speak the truth, Has ever my protection been abus'd Essay. To shelter ro or stop the course of law? Have any that end on me been screen'd From publick justice? Or have I indulg'd The breach of social duty? Fleming. I aver, The man that says it greatly injures truth, And dares not shew his face to make it good. Douglas. At least, my heart acquits me of designs To honour so repugnant. But 'tis strange The authors of such false reports should dare To shew their heads before th'assembled States Where truth and justice ever should preside. Fleming. These false reports industriously are spread, By whom, for what intent, I will not say. Whatever grudge the ministers might owe Your noble father, him they dread no more; He would exert his antient right, and judge Within his jurisdiction, be the cause Such as to common royalties belong, Or such as seem'd above a subject's sphere. This gave offenceâBut since his death, my Lord, No case hath happ'ned, which the meanest Baron Has not an ample pow'r to have decided. Douglas. The ministers appear to be my friends; Nor have they list'ned with a willing ear To these injurious tales; they would not else Have kindly broke a blade by malice forg'd To wound me in the tend'rest part. Fleming. This favour, in the scale of justice said, A down outweighs: they only did you right. To me, their difference with my Lord your fatherâ Douglas. That gave me pain, and had an ill effect. I neither will condemn; tho' yet I own, He seem'd to treat them with too much contempt. Whate'er the men, the offices they hold, From highest subjects claim a just respect. Their families, compar'd with some, are new; What then? In the impartial eye of reason, The accidents of birth and fortune weigh not. The man, who treading in the paths of virtue. Can raise a name, or fortune to himself, May look with just contempt on him, who boasts His birth-right-titles, and his father's worth. Fleming. 'Tis greatly said my Lord! a generous soul Will never boast of what it owes to chance. Perhaps my Lord on some occasions shew'd Too warm resentment of the wrongs he bore; Was he alone to blame? The world allows, He knew the men, and judg'd of them aright. Douglas. Here let their quarrels rest. Should we consult Our cousin Grame, before we write the Regent? Fleming. compliment, which to his worth justly due. Douglas. Take care my friend, The messenger be fitly entertain'd. [Exit, Fleming. Douglas , solus. Would I had been an humble cottager, Below the eye of this malicious world! Plenty, with liberal hand my board supplies, And wide domains acknowledge me their Lord; Meantime the noxious breath of envy blasts The tender shoots, I vainly hop'd to raise From honour's rootâAn honest fame hath charms The stictest virtue needs not blush to court; And he that coolly hears his fame arraign'd, Must know himself a villainâ (going, meets Grame) SCENE II. Douglas, Grame. Douglas. Cousin Grame, You meet me opportunely on the way To call upon you. Look at this (giving a letter) and give Your sentiments upon it, as a friend. (a pause, while Grame reads the letter) Grame. I like it not, my Lord: the stile is good, But I suspect the meaning is not fair. Douglas. What answer do you think we should return? Grame. Your thanks, my Lord, for having done you right. Douglas. That compliment would hardly pass at Court. Should we attend the meeting of the States? Grame. As matters stand, you'll give me leave to say, I should not think it prudent: no my Lord, The King's a child, the ministers who rule Him and the State, the en'mies of your house. Douglas. I know you love them not. Your prejudice Leads you to think amiss of all they do. Grame. My Lord, a long experience hath taught me, To question the sincerity of him, Who from an open enemy, assumes The specious mask of friendship; and the more If the transition's sudden and unlook'd for. Douglas. But why, my cousin, view them in that light? If stricter union 'twixt us can promote The publick good, soon may it come about. Grame. Perhaps, my Lord, they use the publick good, But as a cloak to cover bad designs. Did they indeed regard the common-weal, Could their regards be local? Would they bear Oppression, murder, ev'ry vice to reign Without controul in one place, while in others, The vague complaints of nameless wretches drew Their whole attention? Is not this the case? What corner of the country hath not felt The dire effects of their unseemly discord? To-day a proclamation strictly chargeth, That none regard the orders of the Regent, But ere to morrow's sun goes down, another Flies in the face of that, and bids obey him. To whom can men, in such a case apply For justice and protection? If to either, The other's faction takes a quick revenge, And ruins those, before but half undone. What heart but shudders at the barbarous acts Committed by the western islanders? Yet not a word of this in parliamentâ Whole counties to the capital repair'd, To lay their grievances before the States; But all was hush when the assembly met, Except Lord Douglas, not a soul accus'd. I own, such partial dealings make me fear, That ill designs are form'd against your house. As yet, my Lord, you're young, and know not men: It grieves my soul to think how few are honest! The mind that's conscious of its own regard To truth and justice, and hath never felt The ill effects of perfidy in others, Is ever apt to think too well of man, Douglas, Perhaps so cousin: nor is it strange if those Imbitt'red by the villainy of some, From thence, conclude too harshly of the whole, Forgive me, cousin, if I cannot see The matter in the light you take it up. What have I done, that I should fear to meet Th'assembled States? Where is the man that doubt The publick faith? On this I rest secure. Should I decline to go, they might conclude, That consciousness of guilt had kept me back. To-morrow we set out. Would you were able To bear us company, that as in private, In publick we might shew the just regard, To age and virtue. Grame. (wiping his eyes I have done my Lord- Heav'n grant a prosperous issue to your journey!â Forgive the weakness of a poor old manâ These eyes were dim ere yours had seen the lightâ Soft was the scene when they beheld you first, A smiling infant in the nurse's lap: The good Lord Douglas took you in his arms, Twice kist your rosy lips, then smiling said, âGrame! love thy little cousinâand take care, âIf thou surviv'st me, to make up his loss. âThou know'st the dangerous course he has to steer, âUpon the shelfy coast of human lifeâ âPoint out the rocks, in pity to thy friend.â I've done my duty, if my heart says true; And can no moreâmy friend deserv'd a tearâ I thought this moisture dried, with age and grief, But find it runs apaceâa little longer,â And age, and pain, and sorrow are no more! Douglas. My father! and my friend! the kind regard Well, I shew, deserves, and has my grateful thanks; share we not way to these unkind suspicions, days hence, we'll laugh at them together. Grame. rant we may! for till we meet again, An easy moment I can ne'er enjoy. [Exit Grame. SCENE III. Douglas, Lord William. Lord William. Methought I saw our cousin Grame go out, With an unusual gloom upon his face. Douglas. I have a letter from the States, the answer Which I intend, suits not with his opinion. Lord William. Sir Malcolm hath inform'd me of the letter, Who greatly doubts, it does not mean you good. Douglas. To me 'tis strange, that men of sense and worth, Should draw conclusions so remote, and doubt The publick faith. I wish they had approv'd My resolution; but cannot recede From what my conscience tells me is my duty, Because my friends fore-see some danger in it. 'Tis ours to do our duty; heav'n alone Fore-knows the issue; and will ne'er forsake The man whose views the laws of virtue bound. It is resolv'd: to morrow we set out; Two friends, and servants, only in our train. Lord William. I humbly think, my Lord, the number I dare no doubt the publick faith; but stil Our cousin Grame's experience of the world His knowledge of the men; his love to you, Perplex me not a little. At least permit An hundred horse to go; so small a train Can never give offence. Douglas. Forgive me, cousin, A smaller number, to the squinting eye Of malice, would appear the sign of guilt. I mean to shew the world, my views are just, And that my deeds can bear the test of law. No more a large retinue can impart A dignity to man, than gaudy dress Worth to his mind, or to his body health. Lord William. May I not hope the honour to attend you? Douglas. You know my just regard, but give me leave To beg that you insist not in a suit, I cannot grant. None of my house, or name, On this occasion goes with me to court, Except my brother. It will give me joy, To see you there soon after; but till once My character is clear'd, those vile reports Prov'd false and groundless, I will ne'er assume The state, which to my birth and house belongs. Lord William. insist not; but shall follow soon, the pleasure. which your heart must On fame restor'd and innocence approv'd. SCENE IV. Lady Beatrix, Douglas, Lord William. Lady Beatrix. My Lord, you have a letter from the States, I come to give you joy. No more your fame Shall vilely be traduc'd; as silver tried, Your character must brighter shine; your foes By truth's superior lustre dash'd must hide Their dastard heads. The conduct of the States Does honour to themselves, and right to you. Douglas. It does, my sister; yet our friends have drawn Such strange conclusionsâ Lady Beatrix. Fleming seems to doubt The honour of the States. For me, my Lord, I cannot think so ill of human kind: It is not come to that: however loose The principles of some, the publick faith Is sacred deem'd by all. Douglas. Your sentiments And mine exactly correspond: to me No ground of doubt appears: I would not live, Suspected of the crimes, the busy world Lays falsely to my charge. Lady Beatrix. 'Tis your, my Lord, To wipe such foul aspersions off your house; 'Tis yours, to drag those miscreants into light, Who hid in darkness, shoot their poison'd shafts, To wound your rising fame. But still my Lord, Let prudence be your guide; weigh, coolly weigh, Whate'er your more experienc'd friends have said. Douglas. Our cousin Grame and I have duly weigh'd Their grounds of doubt: meantime I must dispatch My answer to the States. [Exit. Lord William. 'Tis not in man To 'scape the censure of a busy world: But injur'd innocence, at last shall shine Refulgent through the mist by envy rais'd. [Exeunt.</field>

I do indeed, my Lord, and hope your motion Will have the good effect you had in view. Livingston. Perhaps it may, my Lord; tho' some advices Since come to town, set Douglas in a light Which shews I was mistak'n; his designs Are deeper laid, than from his time of life, I could have thought of. Ev'ry prudent mean Must first be tried; but should he still persist In those illegal courses, and despise The friendly admonitions of the States, I own, I'm difficulted how to act. Angus. Should it appear, that his designs but glance Upon the State; tho' of his name, and house, My interest and my sword shall be against him. The publick-good at stake, each private tie Must be forgot. Livingston. 'Tis greatly said my Lord! But should the States impeach him of his crimes, Of course a trial followsâEv'ry where The lawless and abandon'd are his friends. Angus. The States, my Lord, can only do their duty, And leave th'event to heav'n. Livingston. This I admit, But then, the servants of the Crown must still Have in their eye the safety of the whole, And, if on some occasions they abridge The tedious forms of law, the end in view, I think, should give a sanction to their act. Angus. My Lord, I understand you not!âThe law In its minutest forms should be observ'd! It is our life, our liberty, our all. Livingston. How oft my Lord, hath liberty been hurt By a punctilious zeal for forms, at first Intended to secure it? Human laws Must ever share the weakness of their authorsâ Angus. My Lord, excuse me: Whither tends your speech? Livingston. Only to shew, that should my Lord of Douglas By prudent measures be restrain'd, the State Secur'd from the designs he has against it, Some forms may be dispens'd with, which gone through Might be th'occasion of a greater ill, Than that we meant to cure. Angus. Perhaps they might. I am not skill'd in politicks, my Lord, Nor do I love them, when they interfere With plain and open dealing. Virtue's bold, And never fears to meet the greatest odds, Always secure of heav'n upon its side. Livingston. Your sentiments, my Lord, so truly great, Admit of no replyâMay heav'n prevent My fears, and order all things for the best. Lord Angus will excuse meâan appointmentâ Angus. Make no apology, nor let me hinder Your more important business. Livingston. My Lord!â [Exit. Angus , solus. If I mistake not much the Regent's aim, He meant to draw me in to some design, He has in view against my Lord of Douglasâ His speech in parliament, so smooth, so artful, Made me indeed believe he was his friendâ 'Tis well the States are met; he will not dare To question the indemnity they gaveâ Perhaps I wrong himâstatemen oft affect To talk ambiguouslyâI must however, Put Douglas, and his friends upon their guard.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Crichton-Castle. Lenox, Fleming. Lenox. I like it not sir Malcomâten to one, These over-courtesies are only meant To hide a hollow heart. Fleming. The generous youth Unpractis'd in deceit, receives as gold, Th'adult'rate coin they spread before his eyes. And much I doubt, our joint attemps will fail, To save him from the snare we justly dread. Lenox. We must endeavour it, whate'er the issue, We cannot, must not, see him blindly run In such a dangerous pathâAdmit we fail, Our conscience will acquit us. I have mark'd The countenance of the Chancellor, and can see He loves him notâScarce has an hour elaps'd Since we were here, but messengers have past From hence to townâSome dark design's in view, May heav'n dissappoint it! Fleming. Have you mark'd, With what assiduous care he tends my Lord? Lenox. I have. In ev'ry different point of view The danger heightens, and my doubts encrease. 'Tis true their honour, and the publick faith, Are both engag'd; but what are these to men, Who practis'd in deceit, can coolly act, As faith and virtue were but empty names; Religion, but a bug-bear of the State, To frighten fools, and keep the world in awe. Oaths or engagements cannot bind the man, Of pow'r possest, who holds religion cheap. Fleming. The observation's just. Tho' laws are made The vicious to restrain, the good alone, Regard them in their moral view, and yield Obedience, where they safely might transgress. Yonder he comesâThe Chancellor with him still! Let us retire to think upon the means, That prudence my suggest to 'scape the snare. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Crichton, Douglas. Crichton. Indeed my Lord, you set an overvalue On this poor instance of our just respect. Douglas. The States, my Lord, by this their act have shownâ Crichton. No compliments!âWhat could the States do less? The great, my Lord, have always been abus'd, By sanguine tempers and licentious tongues; Such, with a wicked pleasure, watch their steps, Abroad, at home, not privity can screen From the malignant glance of envy's eye. In popular assemblies still we find Weak men, who sway'd by vulgar prejudice, Can swallow ev'ry tale by malice whisper'd, To hurt them, in the publick estimation. Such think not for themselves, but blindly plunge Into the stream of error; those who see, And know their danger, should in pity lend Their hand, to help them outâWe did no more. Douglas. My Lord, your conduct is an ample proof, That you adopt this generous sentiment. Crichton. My Lord, your servant!âFlatt'ry is a vice My soul detests: yet give me leave to say, The house of Douglas merits the respect The States have shown it. Douglas. If it shall appear, That I, or mine, by accident have wrong'd The meanest subject in his right, or giv'n Protection to the miscreant who did; An ample satisfaction shall be made. I reverence the laws: let him stand forth Who says I wrong'd him; humbly I'll reply, Conscious that justice will decide between us, And give to each his due. While heav'n permits My heart to beat, I firmly mean to act To others, as I wish they would to me. The honour of my country, and my King, Shall, like a precious jewel, always hang Next to my heart, and to my soul be dear. Crichton. Such noble sentiments confirm the hopes Your character inspir'd. While thus you act, The Sov'reign's just respect, the subjects love, And what exceeds them both, a heart approv'd, Will be the happy issue; this, my Lord, Is an ambition worthy of your birth. My lord the Regent, much your friend my Lord, And I, had waited of you long ere now, But that we were advis'd great art was us'd, To make you look upon us as your foes. Douglas. I must confess, that some about me strove To keep us still assunder, and to give Impressions, which I could not think were just. Crichton. It cannot be deny'd, your noble father Upon the justest grounds was discontent: He saw the first, the most distinguish'd trusts, Conferr'd on men in all respects below him; Himself neglected, tho' his rank, his parts, His virtue and experience gave a title, Which factious envy only could dispute. The States, my Lord, whate'er their motive was, Conferr'd those offices on us, unask'd. Perhaps as they put by my Lord of Douglas, The more to shew their pow'r, thy fix'd on men, Whose humble views could never have aspir'd To such distinguish'd rank, and sacred trust. The never-ceasing toils, the restless nights, Which statesmen must put up with, were they known, Would melt the heart of envy into pity. A temporary pow'r, a local title, Too dear are purchas'd! Would that I had spurn'd The shining baubles, and liv'd retir'd, in peace. Douglas. The offices you bear, are so essential To order, to the publick-good, that some Must needs have bore them. Providence hath mix'd In human life the bitter with the sweet: My Lord, I mean not, that a sounding title, Appointments and precedence are rewards, Proportion'd to the weighty cares of State, These, tho' the food of envy, cannot charm A generous spirit, conscious of its worth. To stay the proud oppressor's hand; to raise Declining virtue; to preserve the State From foreign bondage, and intestine broils; To chear the orphan, and make glad the heart Of humble poverty; are acts of pow'r, Which shed a pleasing influence on the soul. Crichton. I grant they are. But where's the man can promise, A happy issue to the best designs? A thousand accidents may intervene, To render his attempts to serve the State Abortive, and himself the game of fools. I say not this, with an intent to check That strong propensity to serve the publick, For which your house hath ever been distinguish'd. How base were that!âIt is a generous flame Which warms the patriot's breast: his ample heart, Expanded wide, in holy union holds The happiness of myriads yet unborn, Connected with his own. Douglas. As yet, my Lord, The cool experience, the superior skill, Th'extensive knowledge both of men and things, Requir'd to fit a man for publick life, Are not in me. Long may the State be serv'd, By men whose parts are equal to their trust. Crichton. A modest diffidence hath ever been The sign of genuine worth: in youth it charms, Nor less delights in age. Experience adds A weight to counsel, and a grace to virtue; Thus far it may, but years can never give, What nature has deny'dâYour friend my Lord. [Exit Crichton. SCENE III. Fleming, Douglas. Fleming. My Lord, the time permits not long discourse, Nor formal introduction; there's a snare Spread for your life or freedom; to proceed Upon this journey I aver unsafe. Douglas. By whom sir Malcom!âCircumstances strong, Must guide your judgment ere you thus could speak. Fleming. The Chancellor is not your friend: his eye Speaks plainly out the rancour of his heart. The eye's allow'd the index of the soul, And often shews the wicked heart within. His strain'd respect and complaisance, are meant But to deceive. Express upon express Have been dispatch'd, since ever you were hereâ Douglas. Are these the circumstances whence you draw Conclusions so remote? Iv'e heard that lovers Construe the meaning of their mistress's eyes, As vanity suggests. 'Tis strange my friend! Your reason does not check such idle fears; Expresses pass to townâAnd may they not, On many just occasions, which to us Bear no relation? Must the wheels of State Stand still in compliment, till I am gone? Fleming. The Chancellor has watch'd you like a child, Since you arriv'd; been with you still by day; Seen you to bed; set spies upon us allâ Douglas. What dreams are these!â Fleming. For heaven's sake my Lord!â Douglas. Were any that belong to me deny'd Access to speak their mind? Could he divine Civility would thus be deem'd deceit, Respect, a cover to such black designs? And complaisance a crime? I blush to think His hospitality is thus requited. Too oft it is the fate of men of rank, To have about them those who blow the coals Of discord, and rekindle antient feuds. No doubt they have their private ends in view. How could they else, in spight of all the charms Of peace, and social virtue, bar the way To reconcilement? Thus to speak to one Whose principles I know, his worth approve, Must give me painâI'm really at a loss For words to speak my wonderâHow my friend, Are you the dupe of such unmanly fears! Fleming, Bear witness heav'n! with what regrate I saw The sad necessity of such a charge; His time of life, and high pretence to virtue, Ill suit with such designsâI may be wrongâ At least, my Lord, propose but to return; Perhaps the bare pretence may lay him open. Douglas. I never will propose what I intend not! For you sir Malcom, since you apprehend I know not what of danger, I dispense With your attendanceâBe the peril mine! Fleming. I urge the thing no moreâWhat I have said, Was the result of love and just respect. It never shall be said I stay'd behind, Or turn'd my back upon Lord Douglas' foes. My safety, heav'n can witness! never cost A moment's thoughtâBut if you will proceed, At least permit Lord David to return. The prudent counsel of your noble father, You must remember, âNever both to go Into a place, you could not call your own.â Douglas. I will not taint his mind with such suspicions. Fleming. Yet, let me beg my Lordâ Douglas. I'll hear no more!â [Exit Fleming. SCENE IV. Douglas, Crichton. Douglas. My Lord, I look upon you as my friend, As such, with honest freedom speak your mind. Say, for your years and wisdom may explain, What seems to me mysterious, why am I So much the subject of licentious tongues? 'Tis strange! 'tis wondrous strange! that I alone Of all the great, unconscious of offence, Should be the mark of slander and reproach. Crichton. Censorious tongues are never at a loss; Rather than want a handle to revile; The most indifferent actions they impute To evil meaning. Their malignant aim Skulks under fair pretence, and honey'd words. They ever and anon profess regard For those they mean to stabâBut let them say; Happy the man, who self-approv'd can hear The murmuring voice of envy undisturb'd. Slander too gross defeats the very end The authors have in view; a lie must have Of truth the semblance, or it can't deceive. Indeed, my Lord, the numbers you retain, By malice multiply'd, above the truth, Afford your foes a plausible pretence, To say, you mean to over-awe the State; Two thousand men your enemies give out, Are not unusual in Lord Douglas' train. I think it can't be true: th'enormous charge Of such attendance, soon would drain a prince. Douglas. My Lord, I cannot contradict the fact, If vassals, friends, and servants you include. The base design infer'd, I must disclaim, As from my thought remote, and false as hell. The bounty of their princes hath bestow'd Upon my ancestors a large estate; Their frequent publick trusts hath still enlarg'd The circle of their friends; these not ungrateful, Full oft attend me, when I could dispense With vain parade, that never gave me joy. Ev'n now, had my intent to come to town Been known, a thousand had been here unbid. With some, 'tis compliment, in others duty. The former to refuse, the world would think Th'effect of sullen pride, or fordid gloom; Still to excuse the latter might be deem'd A passing from my rightâI ever thought That men of rank and fortune should disdain Th'unsocial turn, which marks the vulgar soul. To hoard an useless treasure, and to gorge Unnumber'd acres, at the high expence Of ev'ry virtue, social and divine, To me appears a wretched choice indeed! I mean not to exceed the bounds prescrib'd By prudence, and in riot to consume The fortune of my fathers; but to add, Still lands to lands, and eagerly to grasp At all I have not, were as mad, as vain, As if a hungry wretch refus'd to eat The bread he had, yet cried aloud for more. Crichton. 'Tis justly said, my Lord: what we enjoy Is all we have: without a soul to use, The goods of fortune, like a fleeting dream, But tantalize the fancy, and expose Their wretched owners to a world of ills. The sordid mind in midst of plenty pines, Nor tastes with relish what the liberal hand Of heav'n bestows. Alone intent to heap, The pleasures which from social virtue flow Affect it not; corroding care and gloom Fill up the whole of its unhallow'd hours. Once more, my Lord, and I have done, 'tis said, That knighthood you confer, the antient right, The envy'd right of sovereign pow'r alone. Douglas. I do: that right my ancestors enjoy'd. Such pow'r, however envy'd, all confess, A sovereign prince may give. Discreetly us'd, No ill effects can flow from such a grant. Crichton. Long may Lord Douglas thus assert his right, And grace the title he so justly bears. Mean time, my Lord, the posting sun invites To prosecute our journey. Douglas. I, my Lord, Will instantly attend you. Crichton. Then we go. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Douglas-Castle. Lady Beatrix sola, a note in her hand. 'Tis Fleming's handâ(reads) âThis morning we set out from Crichton-Castle for Edinburgh âsince we have been here, many circumstances have induced me to believe, that some wicked design is carrying on between the ministers against my LordâI have in vain endeavoured to alarm himâtime permits not further particularsâI have sworn the bearer to make dispatchâmay heav'n dissapoint my fears!â âAngels and ministers of grace defend him!ââ Going out, meets Lord William, and returns. Read that my Lord, and tremble for your friend! Lord William , after reading the note. Perdition seize the villains! dare they hope To hurt my Lord of Douglas, and to live? Lady Beatrix. What dare not wicked men, of pow'r possest? O fly my cousin! fly to their relief! My friend! my guardian! ev'ry tender name Would be too little for the man that savesâ Lord Douglas, and his brotherâ Lord William. That shall I, Or perish in th'attemptâ Lady Beatrix.

Lady Beatrix. Down down my heart!âThis is a time for action, A female tear will not divert the storm. Grame , to Lord William. Alas my Lord! you think not of the danger, That must attend so rash an enterprise; The danger, not your own, I know you fear not, But to the noble friends you mean to serve. Unarm'd, and unattended as they are, Perhaps their generous confidence may turn Aside the wicked purpose of their foes, Whate'er it is. But should a hostile band, Approach the capital, you on their head, I dread the consequence!âThe States alarm'd, Might rashly judge Lord Douglas had contriv'd This plan, to forward some undue attempt; Perhaps on that presumption!âO forbear, Your friends are in their power, to urge their fate! Lord William. I would not, heav'n can witness! But to stay Inactive here, Lord Douglas' life in danger, Can honour dictate? Could my friend approve? What would you else propose? I'll patient hear For wisdom is in age. Grame. That you, my Lord, Should countermand the orders you have giv'n, And only send a chosen friend to town, To learn the truth of things; then coolly act As prudence may suggest. Lord William. How can I thusâ Lady Beatrix. I do approve our cousin's cool advice, And beg it may be follow'd, think, my Lord, How strong the reasons he has urg'd; how dire The consequence he fears! Lord William. Thus far I yield, To wait till a return from Fleming shews The ground of his suspicions. If my Lord Enjoys his freedom, and was well receiv'd, Then I'm their friendâBut if his life or liberty Shall be attempted, hear and help me heav'n! As I with unremitting zeal pursue The just revenge of innocence betray'd. [Exit. Grame. O what a world is this!âWhere righteous heav'n Can innocence be safe?âO why prevail The slaves of vice o'er virtue's free born sons! [Exeunt. The End of the fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Edinburgh-Castle. Crichton, Livingston. In close conference. Crichton. How deep are his designs! The artful youth, Talks much of virtue; with a smiling brow, And soft engaging manner, stoops to hear The plaints of all about him; mildly checks The guilty, and affects to feel the pain Of the distress'dâInsuperable pride, Restrain'd by policy, thus eggs him on To acts of seeming greatnessâWhy, my Lord? But to supplant his Sovereign in the love And just respect, which nature and the laws Have mark'd his own. Livingston. But if in durance kept, They cannot hurt the StateâThus far I think, That popular pretence the publick good, May bear us out; but to attempt his life, His friend's, his brother's too, to me, my Lord, Seems full of danger. Crichton. Is the danger less To us, and to the State, while Douglas lives? As heav'n hath put them in our hand, my Lord, Their fate should be the sameâAll are the foes Of us and of the State. Livingston. Lord David's youthâ Crichton. The prudent gard'ner crops the noxious weed, Before it blows. This great revenge will cow The heart of faction: meaner foes will dread To lift their tongue against us. Livingston. Still my Lord, The world will think their doom severe, their friends Will raise the publick cryâThe States alarm'd, May judge it prudent to abridge our pow'r. Crichton. If ev'ry danger possible be fear'd, Adieu to action! like a frozen plant We stand and perishâThey or we must fall! Livingston. Theirs be the lot! I plead their cause no more. Crichton. Then we're agreed my LordâThe try'd Monteith Must instantly be call'dâA trusty guard Plac'd at the gateâA warrant must be wrote, Sign'd, seal'd, and sent the Captain of the guardâ Lord Douglas with his brother, and their friend, Now make the circuit of the castle walls, Ere they return, these orders must be given. [Exit Crichton. Manet Livingston. How Angus fir'd when I gave distant hints Of what we had in viewâMy courage fell, And but for Kirkton's hint, âBeware a Douglasâ Had stood a coward confestâFrom Abercorn, Slow and inactive, nothing's to be fear'dâ Young Abercorn, Angus, and Dalkeith, May storm a littleâBe it soâOur pow'r, That blest pretence the publick-good, at last Must carry all before themâStill I feel The woman in my heartâConscience no more!â The thought that favours Douglas is a lie! [Exit. SCENE II. The King, Livingston, Crichton, Douglas, Lord David. At Dinner. The King. Indeed my noble cousins you've been unkind, To stay so long from court. Douglas. My royal Liege, Your highness shall not need again to blame The same neglect in us. The King. Well then my Lord, On that condition I forgive the past. Crichton. My Liege, your royal ancestors have ow'd The greatest obligations to his house: Still forward to oppose their country's foes, And ever ready to support the rights Of Scotland and its friends. The King. 'Tis true my Lord. I've often heard the Queen my mother say, That Douglas was my friend, and talk of wrongs She thought he could redress, were he at court. Crichton , (aside to Livingston) Mark that my Lord!â Livingston. Thus children tell the truthâ (aside) My Lord, the kings of Scotland have not been Unmindful of the house of Douglas' worth. The bounty of the prince is ill repaid, If each repeated act does not encrease The subject's love. Obedience is a claim To which ungenerous princes have a right, How deeply founded his, whose high rewards, Make interest and duty coincide? What could a prince bestow, except his crown, Which hath not been, with liberal hand, bestow'd Upon the house of Douglas, by our kings? Douglas. My Lord, if I mistake not, your discourse Obliquely glanceth on my fathers fameâ Livingston. What if it did!âPerhaps I meant it should!â Douglas. Forgive the boast, my house hath never stain'd The honours which it won, nor lurk'd at home, When Scotland's danger call'd it to the field. Crichton. If some deserv'd them, others have abus'd The favour of their prince, and strove to rise Above a subject's rank; to awe the State, And trample on the pow'r to which they ow'd Such obligations as could ne'er be paid. Douglas. If any of themâ Crichton. If!âPresumptuous youth! That if implies a doubt of what I say! Douglas. Was it for this, my Lord, you brought us here? 'Tis mean! thus to insult me, in a presence Where common decency forbids resentment. Livingston, whispers to a Servant. The King. My lords, you grieve my cousins. Let me begâ Enter a Servant with a Bull's Head on a Dish, which he sets on the Table before Douglas. Douglas , rising in haste. Is this the welcome, kings give to their guests!â What have I done my Liege to merit death? Several armed Men rush into the Room and lay hold of Douglas and Lord David. The King. Good heav'n! where am I!âVillains touch them not! (The Fellows seem indetermined) Crichton. Slaves! do your duty, or by heav'n you die! Bind fast their arms, and instant bear them hence. Livingston. Away with them to death! Crichton. To instant death!â The King. To death my lords!âAlas! what have they done?â Crichton. The tale's too long, your highness yet too young, To comprehend the blackness of their crimes; Hereafter you, and all the world shall know, How justly they deserv'd the fate they meetâ Bear hence the traitors!â Douglas. Traitors dost thou say! Thou hollow hearted statesman! if thy soul Knows aught of virtue, scorn to give a name Thy conscience stamps a lie! full in thy teeth I throw the vile aspersion!âTo my prince, My country, and its laws, a faithful friend, Here, in my sovereign's presence, I defie thee! False as thou art, to thee I dare appeal, Say, had my deeds been foul, my views dishonest, Could I have trusted thee, slept at thy house Two nights, and brought my only brother there? In spight of all my warmest friends could say, I thought thee honest, fearless enter'd here Where none can help me; brought my brother too! O faith! O virtue! whither are ye fled! Livingston , (to Crichton) My Lord! I wonder you can bear him thusâ Douglas. Is then the publick-faith on which I came, Of no account with thee? Is there a man So lost to honour, virtue, all that's good? Livingston. The publick-faith in common cases binds, But cannot, where th'observance would produce A greater ill than from its breach can flow. Douglas. Alas! my country! what hast thou to fear, From men who blush not, coolly to avow Such principles as these! Crichton. Slaves bear them hence!â The King. For heav'n's sake, my lords, untie their hands; You cannot mean to kill themâOn my knees I'll beg their life. (offers to kneel) Or will you kill me too? Livingston. Was ever royalty so low disgrac'd! Your highness need not, must not interfere, They both shall die, before the sun goes down. Crichton. No favour they deserve, and none shall have! Douglas. I scorn thy favour! Let but justice speakâ What have I done? What deed of mine can warrant The odious appellation thou hast giv'n? Thy pow'r may finish, what thy craft begun, And let it!â'Tis the lot of man to die! But canst thou hope the world will be deceiv'd By vile pretence, or e'er approve a deed Subversive of the common faith which binds Society together? Crichton. Enough to thee, Thy deeds are tried, thy final sentence past; Thine, and thy father's crimes together weigh'd, Have sunk thee in the scale of equity. The world I mind not, let it blame the deed, Yet shall it not prevent itâThou shalt dieâ Douglas. I sue not for my life, nor would I live, On terms so baseâAdmit my crimes are great, What hath this child done? How hath he deserv'd A sentence so severe?âfor him I sue, For him I'll humbly kneel, O save my brother! Whose generous nature ne'er offended man. Lord David. No my good lords, I care not to outlive So kind a brotherâTho' I'm but a child, I'll think myself a man, and die like him, If you permitâIndulge my first request. Crichton. Thy suit is granted. Would thou wert the last, Of thy detested name! The King. Alas! my Lord, You will not kill the child because he bears A name you like not. I have often heard That mercy is a virtue which exalts The throne of princes. In my tender years, Stain not my crown with blood. O think my Lord! Your little son stood thereâHow would you plead, Were I so cruelâ Crichton. Cease my Liege to urge A suit against yourself. My son in vain Should plead for mercy, were his guilt like theirs. The King. You ask'd me to invite them here to dine; Why make me an accomplice? Livingston , (aside.) How he talks! Crichton. By heav'n they die! When you assume the reins Of government, we humbly bend our wills To your opinion, but till then must act As prudence shall suggest. Leave to the mob, This vulgar pity; 'tis below a prince; It is a weakness that divests the soul Of all that's great and manly. The King. Ah! my Lord, It is a pleasing weakness, I could die To save my cousinsâsee my Lord he cries!â Douglas. Your generous sympathy, my prince, excites The grateful tear, I weep not for myself; Thus let me thank youâBlasted be the tongue That e'er imputes the wrongs we meet to you. The King , (to Crichton) Am I your King, and yet must plead in vain? Crichton. No more, my Liege!âYour weakness moves me notâ Douglas. Unfeeling monster!âCanst thou be a man, Yet see unmov'd a scene of such distress?â Come then my brother!âWelcome the will of heav'n! Which orders all things for the best, and draws From seeming evils, oft the greatest good. Once we must die, and if in youth or age, Is but a triffleâMy royal Liege farewel!â May heav'n protect you from your faithless friends, And bless you with a long and happy reign!â The King , (covering his face) Farewel my noble cousins!âI cannot save you!â [Exeunt Douglas and Lord David guarded] Livingston. For shame! my Liege, how can you mourn the fate Of traitors, who would pull you from the throne? While they're alive, you cannot reign secure, Your sacred life depends upon their fall. Crichton. Weep not my Liege, we only mean you good, And at the peril of our all, have done This deed to keep the crown upon your head. The King. Alas my lords! the crown has cost me dear! For it I lost my father, basely slain, For it became a stranger to my mother, To all my friends!âAnd now my cousins die That I may wear itâDear pre-eminence! Livingston. Grieve not my Liege, you know not yet the charms, Of sovereign pow'r, or it would give you joy, To think that you had servants who would go Such lengths to serve you, and to save the State. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Outter-Court of the CastleâA Scaffold coveraged with black Cloth. Douglas, Lord David, Mackra, Officer, Guards. Mackra. The charity of the good Lord Chancellor Sends me to your assistance. Douglas. It was kind. You're welcome father! Mackra. Since about to pay The debt you owe to nature and the law, All the amends you now can make the world, Is to confess your crimes, and humbly own Your sentence just. Douglas. I owe not this to truth. To own the sentence past upon me just, Would wrong my conscience which condemns me not. The errors of my life, I humbly hope, Will be forgiv'n; if any I have wrong'd, 'Twas what I meant not; if I e'er let slip Occasion to do good, or pow'r abus'd, I heartily regrate it. Man at best Is weak, and much unequal to the part He has to act; and if in youth he errs, The good will pity, where they can't approve. Mackra. Such general acknowledgements fall short Of what to heav'n is due, and what to man. Your crimes against the State you must confess, If you would hope forgiveness. Douglas. Let me ask, What crime against the State have I committed? Mackra. Thy crimes against the State, so soul, so many, Would any mouth defile, besides thine own; Thy conscience is erroneous, or thy tongue Gives not its verdict. Hadst thou not been guilty, Would men so fam'd for clemency and justice, Have sent thee hither?âHence thy guilt is plain. Douglas. Forgive me father, if I say you want That charity, your Master hath affirm'd The genuine mark of Christians. Thus to judgeâ Mackra. Bold man! dost thou not know the reverence due The minister of heav'n? Douglas. Thou grave reproach! To virtue and religion, which disclaim thee, Dost thou assume that venerable title? 'Tis charity's celestial flame that marks The friend of virtue, and the priest rever'd. Get thee to him that sent thee! much he needs Thy courtly aid, to cheer his guilty soul. Mackra. Once more, unhappy mortal I adjure thee To speak the truth, and own thy sentence just. If not, the pow'r on me by heav'n conferr'd, I must employ to sink thy soul to hell. Douglas. Fear'st thou not him, who sees thy heart and mine!â For his sake I beseech thee, let me die In peace and charity. Mackra. Sleep on secure, Till flames awake thee! Douglas. When like me thou stand'st Upon the brink of time, may heav'n afford! Thy soul, that comfort thou with-hold'st from me. [Exit Mackra. SCENE IV. Enter Fleming guarded, who stops short on seeing Douglas and Lord David. Fleming. O sight of horror! to behold those hands, So oft extended to relieve the wretched, Thus like a felon's bound!â Douglas , turning hastily about. What voice is that! Ha! Fleming too!âWhere will their malice end! What hast thou done, thou best of men and friends! To merit such a fate?âO grief on grief!â Fleming. I've lov'd and serv'd Lord Douglas as I ought, From gratitude and duty. More than this, I think, the conscience of my judges knows I have not done, to merit the respect They put upon me, thus to let me die, With those I would not chuse to live behind. Douglas. A cruel favour!â'twas to stab me deeper They sent thee hitherâWelcome to my heart! My arms are bound, but my affections freeâ O had I listen'd to thy words of truth! Mine eyes had ne'er beheld so sad a scene! My only brother! and my faithful friend! Fall by my folly!â Fleming. Talk not thus my Lord; Forget the past; had righteous heav'n seen meet, This snare you had escap'd; since it permits, With dignity support your lot, and die Greatly as you have liv'd. To die my Lord! What is it? but to bear a moment's pain, And bid a long adieu to this poor spot, Where vice and error reign: to burst the shell Which locks us up in matter, and to move Free and unbounded through the works of God! Douglas. I would not wish to shame my fathers blood, By vulgar fear, nor is there aught in death So terrible, as parting with my friends. My sister! O my sister!âHow can she Support the loss? The death of those we love, Affects the soul with many a grating pang, Above the reach of language to express! Not joyless age, nor keen distress can loose The sympathetick tie, or cool the love Which warms the breast of friends. To part! to die! No more to hear the soothing voice that charms The woes, the cares of human life to rest! No more to taste the genuine joy that flows From breast to breast, to fan the holy flame Of social love and friendshipâO my friend! Thou know'st the pang thy heart was made to feel! Fleming. The friends of virtue part but for a moment: The posting tide of life alone divides, But half divides them: the unbounded soul Outflies the lightning, shoots beyond the stars, And tastes, in vision, their eternal feast, Who first shake off the cumbrous load of clay. Douglas. Poor Grame! thou good old man, what griefs are thine! Severely disciplin'd in virtue's school, Thy soul, tho' tender, may support the shock. But O my sister! hapless, virtuous maid! For thee I feel, for thee the poignant tear Swells in my eyeâin spight of manhood flows!â Fleming. Rejoice my Lord, to gain your native skies! And leave your sister to the care of heav'n. Methinks I see your great force-fathers stand With open arms, upon the happy shore, To give you welcomeâO the shining throng! That pours upon my soul!âWe come! we come! Ye glorious sons of liberty we come!â Douglas. Adieu the world! my friends! to all below! The charm's dissolv'd! and now I pant for bliss! Blest liberty! with thee they liveâWe come! Who would not die to grasp thee to his heart! Fleming. For liberty, your house hath often bled; For liberty despis'd the love of life; For liberty you die, these faithless men With jealous eye beheld your opening worth, And fear'd the just reward of their misrule. Fear not your fame, for every generous heart Must execrate the deed: nor fear your house With you shall fall: these impious men shall live In just contempt, till heav'n avenge their crimes. Your family, so long the care of heav'n, Again shall flourish; future kings shall boast The blood of Douglas. Yonder lucid orb A meaner planet may eclipse, but soon He bursts with greater glory on the eye, Relumes the arch of heav'n, and shines serene. Officer. Your time to live, my Lord, is nearly gone. Douglas. I know it, sir, and quickly shall have doneâ (turning to Fleming and embracing him) Farewel! my faithful counsellor, and friend!â We soon shall meet again, to part no more!â Fleming. Till then, my dearest Lord!âTill then, farewel!â Lord David , embracing Fleming. Farewel! sir Malcom!â'Tis a dismal hour!â Fleming. Farewel! sweet youth!âHave courage for a moment, And these dark clouds will usher in the day!â [Fleming retires to a corner of the Stage. Douglas , making up to Lord David. And now my brother!âthe world's to us no more!â This heav'n permits, and providence is wise!â My friend!âmy brother!âa last!âa kind embrace!â If our remembrance reach to future times, Let it be told, I ask no other fame, We liv'd as brothers, and like brothers died!â Lord David. Farewel! my Lord!âWill death be very painful? Douglas. No my sweet child! 'tis but a moment's pain. (turning to the Officer of the guard) I ne'er oblig'd you sirâYet give me leave To ask a favourâWhen we are no more, I beg you'll see our bodies laid in earth. A little spot will hold them; lay us all Together in a graveâI have a sister, May thank you for your charitable care. If e'er you see her, sir,âPerhaps you mayâ Bid her remember well my parting words. Tell her, it was the very sting of death To leave her, weak and helpless as she is, In such a world, where virtue and her friends Must bear so much. But bid her call to mind The stock from whence she sprung, so often tried In various fortune; and reject with scorn, Whate'er might shame the noble pride of virtue. Bid her forgive the wrongs we meet; nor charge Unerring wisdom rashly. Born to die, The time, the place, the manner, are to man Of small importance; if in death his heart Reproach him not with having liv'd in vain. Officer. My orders are, to see your corps interr'd In decent manner, ere I leave the place; Depend upon my care. Your other charge, Should an occasion offer, ev'ry word I'll faithfully relateâDeep in my mind They are engrav'd; and never can wear out. Douglas. Then we are ready!â (Douglas and Lord David retire to different corners of the Stage, and the Officer gives a signal to the Executioner, who enters with an Ax in his Hand) Executioner , kneeling. On my knees my Lord, I humbly ask forgiveness at your hands. Douglas. Thou never wrong'dst me friendâAccept of this, 'Tis all I have, (gives money) and fearless do thy office, When I shall drop my glove. Lord David , to the Executioner. Take this of meâ (gives money) When I stretch out my arm, I wish to die. Fleming , giving money. When I shall drop my handkerchiefâTake care! And see thou strike not till the signs are giv'n. Douglas , embracing Lord David, and Fleming. O could we die at once!â Fleming. First let me die!â Lord David. O leave not me my Lord!â Douglas. I will not long!â Our friend shall bring thee with himâThink of heav'n! Forgive thine enemies!âand bless thy friends!â My friend!âmy brother!âthe world! and time adieu! [Here the Curtain falls] After a Piece of solemn Musick is performed, the Curtain is again drawn up. I. AFTER-SCENE. Livingston, Lady Livingston, Monteith. Livingston , to Monteith. How did the guards behave? Monteith. In silence deep They hung their heads; and when the pris'ners died, The bursting tear broke loose from ev'ry eye. Livingston. The vulgar still regrate the stroke of justice. Lady Livingston. Humanity must feel the stroke of death, And in the fatal hour forgets the crime. Livingston. 'Tis disaffection, impious discontent!â And how their officer?âYou ey'd him close? Monteith. Extremely grave, and often wip'd his eyesâ He talk'd, my LordâO I shall ne'er forgetâ Livingston. Who talk'd!â Monteith. Lord Douglas. Never mortal diedâ Livingston. Perdition seize thee villain! dost thou speak To me of Douglas?âHence! and learn to dread That pow'r by which he fell!â [Exit Monteith. Lady Livingston. What means my Lord! Livingston. Their officer!âa wretch I lately rais'dâ A woman hearted soldier, stain to arms, But, by the soul of Bruce! the poltroon dies!â Lady Livingston. O talk not thus my Lord!âAdvance in rank, The man whose generous sympathy gives proof Of genuine courage and a manly heart. Livingston. Ha! traitress! say, thou'lt join th'unthinking crowd, To reprobate the deed which I have done!â Lady Livingston. I would, could that undo it!âI affirm The deed dishonest, and my soul detests it! I knew thy soul was base, thou know'st how oft I strove to touch it with the love of virtue; But hence, no more I urge thee to be honest, So foul a crime excludes thee from my heart! Last night, when superstition push'd thee on, O shameful weakness! to consult a witch, 'Twas I that represented her; in pity, I interpos'd between thy soul and hell. Livingston. If so, thou art a devil, for mortal ear Heard not a whisper of my close design. Lady Livingston. I over-heard thee mention Kirkton's name, And from thy temper, guess'd thy mean intent; I watch'd thee close, and saw the low disguise, Meanly assum'd to cover thy disgrace. Livingston. Then thou hast rashly push'd me on to that Which now thou blam'st. I doubted in my self, If better, still to live in anxious dread, Or thus at once, to rid me of my foe. Thy words of dark importââBeware a Douglas.â Believ'd oraculous, alarm'd my soul. Lady Livingston. Had I not reason, thus to caution thee? I knew thy spight to that respected house: What thou had'st done against it; and fore-saw That thou would'st fall before itâfall thou must, Crimes of so deep a die cannot escape The wrath of heav'nâ Livingston. Cease thy abusive tongue. I hold thee now no prophetess, nor mind Thy idle words. Lady Livingston. O that I had fore-known, The wicked purpose thou had'st then in view! Perhaps the threats of such a wretch had done, What conscience, honour, virtue tried in vain. Suppose thy craft and pow'r elude the lash Of human lawsâRemember an hereafter! [Exit Lady Livingston. Manet Livingston. Scarce could I bear the shockâHer biting words Stung like a scorpionâ'Tis over now,â Whate'er the consequence, it must be bornâ 'Tis strange! Monteith's unfeeling heart was mov'd, The guards, their Captain weptâWhat then am I? âRemember an hereafterââThere's the thorn! (A Bell tolls, Livingston listens, starts, and looks wildly about.) The passing bell of some departed soul!â Solemn and awful sound! thou speak'st to meâ Thou speak'st to all!âPerhaps in pride of life, At noon this mortal dream'd of future years, Unconscious of the gathering cloud of fate, Now burst upon himâ (seems thoughtful) SCENE II. Crichton, Livingston. Crichton. Give you joy, my Lord! Of the deliveranceâThis stretch of pow'r The world will loudly blame; that we must bear, And can, if both unite; on this depends Our lives, our fortunes, all we hope or fear. I blush to own, that jealousies and doubts, The whispers of designing men, the voice Of busy faction, hath too often broke The sacred tie of friendship and expos'd Us and the State to danger. Hence be doubt Of one another banish'd. On the faith Of men and christians, let us jointly swear, To stand or fall togetherâWitness heaven!â Livingston. Heav'n is not of our partyâBlood for blood. Crichton. What means my Lord!â Livingston , taking no notice of Crichton. âHereafterâay hereafterââ Ha! thither move their corps!âLet me observe The poor processionâNot a friend to mourn!â No blazon'd ensigns!âNo inscription boasts A long descent!âNot even a servant here!â O greatness! greatness!âvanity! and dust!â Here lay them down a whileâThis, this was Douglas!â Where now the sparkling eye, the rosy cheek, The ruddy lip?âPale! hideous! all besmear'd With blood and dust!âTo-morrow, and to-morrow,â And then another comesâAnd last of all, Death and a long account!âO save me heav'n! The ghost of Douglas, awfully serene, Hath fix'd its eyes upon me!âNow it frowns: Then shoots its piercing eye through all my frame, Points to the headless trunk, and smiles contempt!â 'Tis gone! it soars aloft!â Crichton , (aside) While reason sleeps, Thus, ever-waking fancy to the mind Presents her magick glassâDistorted forms, Hobgoblins, elves, pale fear, and blooming hope, In wild succession passâMean while the soul, Or grasps at shadows, or as vainly starts At unsubstantial ills. Indulg'd too long, These superstitious fancies cloud the mind; Absorb the flame of reason, and involve The soul in darkness. If he thus should talkâ [A soft knock at the door, Livingston looks wildly about] Enter a Servant. Servant. The King, my lords, complains he is not well; And cries incessantly. Thrown on his couch, He often calls on Douglas; beats his breast; Then lifts his eyes to heav'n and wrings his hands. Livingston. His guiltless hands! O heav'n were mine as pure!â Crichton , to the Servant. Fellow retire!âI'll wait upon the King. [Exit Servant. My Lord you dream! or if awake, give hints Of what I ne'er suspected. Livingston. Hints, my Lord!â Crichton. If Douglas justly fell, to you the State Owes the deliverance. If your private views Have push'd you on to thisâ Livingston. O heav'n and earth!â Crichton. Those exclamations pass for nought, my Lord, Who sign'd the warrant? Who in pow'r supreme Directed every step? Who in the house Accus'd my Lord of Douglas? Livingston. Satan blush! And own thy self outdone, nor more pretend Superior craft, or impudence to man. Thy wretched tool I was, tho' first in pow'r: This well thou know'stâ Crichton. Some rest may do you good, Your late disorder is not quite gone off. [Exit Crichton. Manet Livingston. Thus have I lost my peace!âAlas for what? Delusive dreams, air bubbles that arise Upon the varying wave of fancy's seaâ Farewel! my flatt'ring hopesâWhat right have I To look for truth in him, myself so false. O curst ambition! whither hast thou led? To guilt! to horror! these are thy rewards! I dread to be alone!âO conscience! conscience! Thou gloomy tyrant of the guilty mind, Where can I fly from thee, or how divert Thy dire fore-bodings?âO the happy days! When thou with gentle voice lull'd me to rest, And made my slumbers sweetâAlas how chang'd! Nor future days nor nights have joys for me! [Exit. SCENE III. Douglas's House in Edinburgh. Lenox solus. Eternal curses blast the villain's name Who thus betray'd thee! hapless generous youth! Farewel society! farewel to government! To publick order, and to private peace, If such accumulated guilt escape Its due rewardâIt cannot: heav'n is just!â The very multitude abhor the deed; Ev'n now they throng the streets, in wild amaze, Each questioning his fellow, âIs it true!â And mutt'ring curses on the impious actors. O where's the spirit of our brave fore-fathers! When mushrooms such as these can bid defiance To law and justiceâScotland! how distrest! Thy King a child! thy noblest blood thus spilt, By impious men, who revel in thy spoils!â O what a wound hath publick faith receiv'd! What feuds must this nefarious deed produce! Ye guardian Powr's to whom high Heav'n commits The care of states, where are you? Why retir'd!â Our crimes have driv'n you hence! O my poor country! Impartial Judge! lift thine avenging arm! Why should the sons of Belial thus prevail?â But why complaint!âThere is another world, Where injur'd worth shall have a full amends. Here, times may change, new factions rise and fall, But sacred Virtue shall out-live them all. Happy the man! that chuseth for his guide This best conductress, by experience tried: Whate'er befals him, firm his mind remains, Resign'd to bear what ruling-heav'n ordains: Serene, tho' round him storms and tempests roar, Secure of bliss, when time and chance are o'er. [Exit. The End of the Fifth ACT.</field>
