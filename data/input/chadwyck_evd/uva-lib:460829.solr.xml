      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Polyphontes. Ãgisthus. Polydore. Merope. Soldiers. People.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Palace in Messene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Merope. Me. Oh Merope, for what dost thou still live? Perhaps thou'rt no more a mother.âTo what purpose Have I for fifteen years within these walls Dragged on a life of sorrow? To what purpose Been, where I formerly reigned over him, The subject of the impious Polyphontes? The subject of the monster who destroyed, Before my eyes, my consort, and two sons ... One still remains to me, the latest pledge Of inauspicious nuptials; for the throne, And for just vengeance, by my care preserved; My only hope; the sole remaining object For which I wish to live ... Oh son, alas! What now avails it that I saved thee once With difficulty from the cruel slaughter? ... Incautious youth! ... 'Tis now almost a year, Since thou abandonedst the sure asylum, In which with faithful Polydore thou livedst ... That wretched old man, who has been to him Almost a father, six revolving moons Has quitted Elis, and in search of him Strays through all Greece: and I no longer hear Tidings of him, nor of my son: oh state Of horrible suspense! ... and I am forced, To increase its agony, within my heart To smother my insufferable woe ... Nor throughout all Messene have I one Who in my grief can share; yet evermore To my Cresphontes' tomb I ought to stray, And there indulge my tears ... Oh pardon me, That I have not, ere now, beloved consort, Joined thee in death! Our mutual son alone Keeps me alive; ah, should he be no more ... But, who approaches? ... Polyphontes! ... Ah! Let me avoid him. SCENE THE SECOND. Polyphontes, Merope. Polyp. Merope, return; Why thus avoid me? ... I would fain impart Tidings of lofty import ... Me. I would fain Hear nothing from thy lips ... Polyp. Oh cruel lady, Will neither time then, reason, courteous manners, Nor prayers, avail somewhat to mitigate Thy fierce resentment? Thy extravagant, And bitter grief, which seemed almost exhausted, Why for a year since has that grief resumed All its intensity; thus to thyself Rendering thee such a cruel enemy? Thou hatest me; and hate so disproportioned, My destiny, more than my fault, produces.â I from thy consort wished to take his throne, But not his life, I swear to thee: but how Restrain the turbulence of conquering soldiers? My warriors, intoxicate with blood, Pursued him e'en within these palace walls; Nor from their hands could I deliver him. I was, but equitably was, his foe. I indeed, from the noble blood descended Of the HeraclidÃ¦, could not well surrender To him my throne, merely because the urn Bestowed it on him.âBut the instinctive grief Of consort, and of mother, listens not To reason, or to claims however just.â I only wish to know, from whence thy rage, Which hath so long existed, hath derived New aliment? Do I not try all means To alleviate the hardships of thy fate? Ah say what reparation could be made For a mischance in war, that every day I do not make to thee? Me. Now, wouldest thou, That I should render to thee express thanks, Because by thee I only am bereft Of consort, sons, and throne? ... Polyp. Thy sons? In life One of them still remains to thee ... Me. 'Tis false.â Ah! were it but as true! ... I have lost all; I indeed saw that innocent transfixed ... Ah cruel! Thou perhaps exultest, thus To hear the dreadful scene by me revealed? On that dire night, in which thy satellites Ransacked this palace, where confusion reigned, And blood, and cries, and flames, and menaces; Ah! were not all our children, with their father, And our most loyal friends, at once destroyed? Barbarian! thou, alone to scoff at me, Assertest, that, my little helpless babe, Which with so many others was first slain, And then delivered to the hungry flames, By me was rescued! Oh ferocious heart! Dost thou regret that thy inhuman sight On the sad spectacle ne'er fed itself Of his poor mangled form? Thou didst behold, And with thy execrable hand didst touch, The others with a savage greediness ... Ah miscreant! ... Polyp. Lady, if I deem him living, It is because I wish him so.âAs yet The first intoxication scarce was past Which victory brings with it, ere my heart Was much disquieted for those slain children; Who would not only have obtained from me, Destitute both of consort and of offspring, In time, the sure protection of a king, But all a father's fondness. Thou thyself May'st clearly see it; what support have I To solace the infirmities of age? Can the possessor in a sceptre triumph To whom posterity presents a blank, A cheerless blank? ... Since thou assertest, lady, The death of all thy sons, and I believe it; ... At least I may to thee, if not thy sons, Consort, and throne restore ... Me. What do I hear? Of whom thus speakest? Polyp. Of myself I speak. Me. Oh unexpected, new, and horrid insult! Darest thou to offer to a childless mother, That bloody right hand which hath made her childless? Darest thou thy thoughts raise to thy monarch's bed, Who wert his murderer? To my widowed breast Rather present that very sword that slew him; I fear it not, produce it ... But thou deemest, Ferocious man, thy aggravating presence, To me, a punishment more exquisite: Hence, at all hours before mine eyes I see thee; Hence, to augment my grief, thou woundest me With such atrocious words. Polyp. They are most just, These passionate transports of a sorrowing mother. Pour out the bursting torrent of thy grief.â But why should'st thou endeavour to persuade me That its intensity will ne'er abate? Dost thou to every reasonable thought Refuse admission?âDost thou not live on? Already thrice five years thou hast consumed In weeping, and uncomforted distress;â Yet thou supportest it. Each much-loved object, Thou sayest, is taken from thee; in the world There's nothing that thou fearest, hopest, lovest:â And thou remainest living?âThen, to give Some respite to thy sighs, thou feelest yet, That new delights may one day rise for thee, Then thou hast not yet banished every hope. Me. I? ... Nothing ... Polyp. Yes, thou, lady: well reflect Within thyself; ... thou wilt discover then, That the recovery of the throne, perchance Might make thy life less mournful. Me. I see clearly; Thou never wert a father: wholly thou A tyrant art; the throne, and that alone, Engrosses all thy thoughts. My babes, my consort, Far, far beyond all thrones to me were dear; ... And I abhor thee far ... Polyp. Ah, Merope, Listen to me.âI ought now to select A fit companion for my destiny. All is now quiet; all Messenia now Implicitly submits to my controul: Yet does the recollection of Cresphontes Live in the heart of many: evermore The multitude capriciously regrets The monarch which they have not. And perchance, During his transient reign, Cresphontes seemed Just, mild humane ... Me. Seem'd dost thou say? He was so: He did not stoop to feign like other monarchs. Polyp. And would I stoop to practise art with thee? And make parade of that, which, if I said it, Thou never would'st believe, that I'm consumed By love for thee?âListen to me. I hope Now to be acceptably heard by thee, As far as one who has already cost thee So much distress, may such a hope indulge.â Danger has ceased, and disaffected thoughts With it have also ceased: behold my state. Thine is a dreary life, unpitied tears, A languishing in pale obscurity: Thy friends, if thou hast still such, stand aloof, Or, are from terror mute, if they lurk here. All here for thee is force; to this, hast thou Constrained me more than others: but at once All from a single word of thine may wear A different aspect. It would seem to me A useless, cruel, and if thou wilt yet Have it, an outrage fatal to myself, To any other lady should I offer The sceptre of Messenia, once thine own. For my delinquency this now remains The only not inadequate atonement. A skilful leader in perpetual wars The camp has seen me hitherto; through me Messenia's name alone suffices now To intimidate her foes: 'twould sooth my heart Now to the citizens to prove myself An exemplary king. Do thou then deign To adapt thyself to the occasion: well may'st thou Conquered do this, if I disdain it not A conqueror. A life of wretchedness Thou in Messene draggest; fallen so low Thou canst not lower fall: for thee can I Do all things; thou, in recompense for this, If thou'rt disposed to pardon me the past, May'st, I confess to thee, now make my yoke More welcome to Messene. Me. To the good Thee welcome? Who could ever make thee so? Welcome to others, thou, who to thyself Art an abhorrence? Thou dost know too well How much thy yoke by all men is detested: Nor other joy than this now mitigates My pangs.âProvided I would make myself For ever infamous, and scorned, and vile, Not only to Messene, but the world, And to myself, which is far worse, to thee Would I resign my hand.âIf thou infer, From my protracted life, an argument That my affliction is supportable; I quickly hope that error to confute, For but a span of life for me remains. SCENE THE THIRD. Polyphontes. Polyp. âCautious in vain; thou art a mother, yes: A day will come in which thou wilt thyself Betray the pent-up secret of thy heart.â Oh yes! that son of thine yet breathes. What else In life supports her? Yet it serves my purpose, To feign with her that I believe him dead. Perhaps I may to perfect confidence The mother lull, while I observe strict watch ... But what hath watching hitherto availed me? It never hath befallen me hitherto To intercept a single message, never Yet to discover where is his asylum; If it be near or distant: thus bewilder'd I know not how to act ... For many years Merope seem'd to me, if not content, Wrapt in a slumber of subsided grief, As one that o'er a secret scheme of vengeance, That every day becomes more ripe for action, Broods silently. But for a year or more Her sorrow has resumed its violence, And her demeanour has been quite transform'd; The tears which had been forced back on her heart, In spite of all her efforts, from her eyes In torrents gush ... Perchance her son is dead? ... Yet the Messenians in their hearts retain A faithful recollection of the father: Nor can I otherwise divest them of it, Even in part, except by placing her, With me, upon the illegitimate throne. Oh throne! by those who have usurped thy rights With what expence of toil art thou retain'd!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Polyphontes, Soldiers. Polyp. Guards, let the criminal alone advance. SCENE THE SECOND. Polyphontes, Ãgisthus. Polyp. Stranger, approach ... Methinks thy mien is youthful For one so resolute in deeds of blood. Ãgis. 'Tis but too true, before thee I appear Defiled with blood, perchance with innocent blood. Strange destiny! and I am also guiltless. Polyp. From whence art thou? Ãgis. From Elis. Polyp. And thy name? Ãgis. Ãgisthus. Polyp. Thy descent? Ãgis. Obscure, not servile. Polyp. What purpose brought thee here? Ãgis. A youthful passion, A love of novelty impell'd me to it. Polyp. Tell me explicitly, and tell the truth, How wert thou driven to such atrocity. Though thou hast forfeited all right to hope, Still I permit thee to indulge some hope If thou'rt ingenuous. Ãgis. To be otherwise Would be a violation of my nature: My free condition is unused to fraud.â By stealth, and unadvisedly, I left The peaceful dwelling of my aged father; For many months already had I wandered Through various cities, when, at last, to-day I journey'd towards Messene. I pursued A narrow and a solitary path, Destined for humble travellers on foot, Which winds along Pamisus' shelving banks; Swiftly I trod this path, urged by desire To gain the city, which, from distance seen, Gave, by its pompous towers and glittering fanes, Abundant promise of magnificence. When lo! I saw a man advance to meet me With eager gait, still swifter than my own: Onward he came like one that fear'd pursuit; His mien was youthful; his demeanour bold, Imperative, and arrogant: from far He waved his hand, that I should quit the path. Most narrow was the place, and scarce allow'd To one free passage: the precarious track, By a precipitous declivity, Descends on one side to the river's brink; The other side, by thorny bushes choak'd, In that direction made the man unwilling To turn aside for me. I was incensed At his deportment, free myself by birth, Accustom'd to obey the laws alone, And to yield deference only to my elders: Hence I advanced with an undaunted step. He, with a terrible accent, cried, âMake way.â I, on the other hand, inflamed with rage, Return'd his menace, and bade him retire. Already had we met: he from his side Unsheathed a dagger, and upon me leap'd. I had no dagger, but I lack'd not courage. With a firm foot I waited his attack: Me he assail'd; I combated his onset, Grasp'd him, and in less time than I relate it, Flung him upon the earth: in vain he strove; I with my knees confined him to the ground. In both my hands his right hand I imprison'd; In vain he menaced, irresistibly And firmly I deprived him of its use. When to the contest he perceived himself Inadequate, insidiously he feign'd Terms of submission. I consented to them; Quitted my grasp, when treacherously a blow, Such as thou seest it here, he aim'd at me, And pierced my clothes. The weapon grazed my flesh: The wound is slight, but boundless was my rage. Blind with revenge, I snatch'd the dagger from him; ... And weltering in his blood he lay transfix'd. Polyp. If this be true, thou hast a lion's heart. Ãgis. Scarce had my hand the fatal blow inflicted, Ere I was stricken with o'erwhelming horror. Unused to blood, I felt myself degraded; I fear'd; yet fearing knew not how to act. First in the stream I hurl'd the dagger: thence The thought occurr'd in the same stream to fling The bleeding victim: thus, it seem'd to me, I should defeat all chances of detection. I did so.âGuess if I am used to guilt: Ah thoughtless! bloody as I was, I ran, Unknowing whither, till I reach'd the bridge. There by thy guards, whom I avoided not, I was secured; and hither have they dragg'd me. I swear to thee I have confess'd the whole. Polyp. Thy tale has all the characters of truth. I feel constrain'd to pity thee; but yet Justice demands thy punishment. I will Ascribe it to misfortune, not to cunning, That thou the body gav'st, perhaps half-living, To the vertiginous gulphs of the swift stream. But thence, as thou thyself must be aware, Thy fault is aggravated. If this were, As thou assertest, some base renegade, Of which too many now swarm up and down, The turbid progeny of civil strife, It might avail thee much. Thy victim's name Alone, would now perhaps suffice to save thee. Ãgis. Wretch that I am! If I am doom'd to fall The victim of involuntary error, What can I say to thee, oh king? Behold me Ready to endure whatever punishment Most terrible thy anger would inflict. I grieve for this mischance; but should grieve more Were I in fault. In my defence alone My unsupported innocency pleads: I boast no ancestry; I have no wealth; In all men's eyes I seem a malefactor; And ah! I am so, to have left you thus, My wretched parents, aged and infirm, Thus disobey'd and thus abandon'd you, Inflicted on you mortal agonies; And perhaps, ere your time, cut short your lives.â Ah! if he yet is living, my good father; He who bestow'd no heritage on me Save uncorrupted manners; he who was The lofty image and the bright example Of human excellence, should he e'er hear That, in Messene, for the crime of murder, I was condemn'd to die, what grief were his! Ah! such a thought is far more terrible To me than death. Polyp. Hear me: thou knowest well, Convicted as thou art of spilling blood, Thy life immediately should pay the forfeit; But yet thy simple undisguised confession Inclines me to relent in thy behalf. Till I have gain'd more certain information, Both of thyself and him whom thou hast murder'd, I shall awhile suspend the final sentence. SCENE THE THIRD. Merope, Polyphontes, Ãgisthus. Polyp. Merope? ... Do not mine own eyes deceive me? Com'st thou to me? and for what purpose, say? Me. The tidings which erewhile I heard have brought me. Is it then true that by the river's brink A man was murder'd, and that afterwards By the assassin to the river committed? ... Polyp. 'Tis but too true: and here the murderer stands. Me. What do I see? ... Oh what a strange resemblance! Polyp. Thou know'st with what anxiety I check The least encroachment on internal peace. Yet, if thou seest this man, or hear'st him speak, Thou almost would'st pronounce him innocent. Me. 'Tis true: his countenance is not like guilt: His mien is noble ... But alas! he yet With blood is reeking. Ãgis. Who denies it, lady? This blood at first too certainly condemns me; But had I been well versed in spilling blood, I had been also versed in cleansing it: A little water, and a dauntless face, Might have eternally consign'd my crime To impalpable oblivion. But, believe me, I feel a punishment far more severe In my remorse, than that which the king now Prepares for me. Yet unavoidable Was this my guilt. Alone, unknown, a wanderer, I was not arm'd for any fatal purpose. The sword I wrested from his hands myself, Which 'gainst the fierce youth, in my own defence, I was constrain'd to use ... Ah! trust my words; I ne'er was disciplined to bloody deeds. Me. Was thy antagonist a youth? Ãgis. He was Equal to me in age. Me. What do I hear? Polyp. And if he speaks the truth, I should suspect He was some questionable character. Along a solitary path he flew, As if to avoid pursuit ... Ãgis. Further, I now Remember that at first in part he hid His face beneath his robe. Me. He hid his face? ... He fled? ...âBut thou, didst thou not know him? Ãgis. Here I am a stranger totally; and he (I have him still before me) seem'd to me Also a stranger; ... nay, he surely was so; At least his dress bespake it, which appear'd Rather like that of Elis than Messene. Me. Oh heaven! ... Of Elis? ... Ãgis. Yes; resembling mine; For I too am from Elis ... Me. Thou? ... Polyp. But why So anxious, so inquisitive? Me. What say'st thou? I anxious? ... Polyp. So it seems to me.âIn short A nameless stranger by another slain ... Me. Who knows what he might be? ... 'Tis true ... There's nothing Whence I should take an interest ... Polyp. For myself, Were I by duty not constrain'd to it, I ne'er should listen to a cause like this. Thou, dead to all affection, dost excite In me no small surprise. How can this question Interest thee? Me. In me, 'twas mere ... desire ... To hear.âYet it appears to me far more The effect of art than accident, that he Should thus from all the body have concealed: And thou so lenient to this murderer, Who thus undaunted in thy presence stands ... I know not ... Ãgis. Fear induced me first to fling The body in the stream; it was not art: I stand undaunted as a man should stand Whose breast feels self-acquitted. Yet, alas! I felt more wretchedness than thou suspectest: And now much more so since I see thee grieve, Trembling, and apprehensive for the slain. Me. I trembling, I? ... I apprehensive? ... No ... But those that are unhappy quickly feel Compassion for the unhappiness of others. Ãgis. For me then feel compassion. I, alas! Am far more wretched than the murder'd stranger, And merit wretchedness far less than he. Rash youth! 'twas he that, without provocation, First would have murder'd me. What profits it That I subdued him, if I am condemn'd With greater infamy to lose my life? And if I lose it not, what can give pain, As shame can give it, to a generous heart? Me. Thy low condition hides a noble soul. His words almost compel me ... yet ... could I Gain some intelligence ... gain but the name Of him whom thou hast murdered ... Polyp. Since, to-day, Thou feel'st an interest foreign to thy habits In hearing this recital; since I see, Oh Merope, that my continuance here Restrains the free expression of thy thoughts, I know not why ... Me. Restrains? ... What dost thou mean? ... With thee I leave him. Polyp. No. That from his mouth Thou may'st learn more, if more there be to learn, With thee I leave him. Thou art well aware That I am ready, and much wish, to make thee Of every question sovereign arbitress; Much more then art thou in a cause so trifling. To thee do I refer him; of his fate Do thou dispose at will. Let this now be The earliest proof that thou despisest not Each gift of mine. Me. And how? ... Polyp. I pray thee yield. Ah! might this be a prelude to thy reign. SCENE THE FOURTH. Merope, Ãgisthus. Ãgis. Canst thou be less compassionate than he? Does not my youth plead for me in thy favour? Look on my face, and canst thou not read there The undissembled feelings of my heart? Does not the grief of my distracted parents Excite thy sympathy? Alas! ... Wert not Thou also once a mother? Ah! for mine ... Me. Yes, I have been a mother to my cost! ... And yet, who knows? ... âThy mother, lives she still? ... A native then of Elis is thy father? Ãgis. No, of Messene. Me. Of Messene, say'st thou? What do I hear! Ãgis. I from my infancy Have heard him so affirm. Me. His name perchance Is Polydore? ... Ãgis. Cephisus is his name. Me. His age? ... Ãgis. Is great. Me. Oh heaven! ... âBut yet the name ... And of what rank, what parents in Messene, Knowest thou? ... Noble? ... Ãgis. No: he was the master Of a small farm, which with his own free hands He loved to cultivate; a peaceful life, Contented with his lot, he with his spouse And children led. Me. And what fatality Drove him from such an enviable state? Why did he quit his dwelling? Ãgis. Oft he told me, That by intestine quarrels of this realm He had been driven to flight; that the revenge Of potent enemies pursued his steps. That all was bloodshed and disturbance here; Whence trembling for his children ... Oh how oft, Dwelling on this, have I beheld the tears Course down his aged cheeks! Me. Thou wert then born, Here, in Messene? And thy father fled To Elis with thee? Ãgis. No: my father carried With him my elder brothers, who were all Snatched from his arms by an untimely death. I only, born of all his children last, In Elis first inhaled the vital air;â Oh wretched father! and I last remain, If I indeed remain to thee!âA wish, E'en from my earliest years, possessed my heart To see Messene; since it was my father's, It seems to me almost my native place. Me. Oh heaven! ... What words are these? ... And he like thee Is youthful ... of an age resembling thine ... And such deportment, ... such expressive mien ... He seems; and yet he is not.âBut erewhile Thou said'st, thy victim also came from Elis. Ãgis. Such my conjecture. Me. Seemed he in disguise? Ãgis. He did. Me. In temper? Ãgis. Arrogant. Me. In dress? Ãgis. Abject. Me. And fugitive? Ãgis. Swift, as pursued, And with suspicion in his looks, he ran Towards me. Me. Barbarian, and thou hast slain him? Ãgis. He would have murdered me. Me. And said he nought To thee in death? Ãgis. Weeping, o'er him I stood A little while ... In death's last pangs he lay ... Me. Ah wretched youth! ... Ãgis. ... Yes ... now ... I recollect; ... That, all his native fierceness laid aside, Sobbing, in tearful accents, he invoked His mother's name. Me. His mother's name? And thou Perfidious wretch, and thou indeed hast slain him? And cast his body in the pityless stream? Alas! ... He's lost! ... Ãgis. Unhappy that I am! What have I done? Does then this crime of mine In any wise touch thee?âThou hast for this Full sanction from the king, dispose of me; And wreak on me a plenary revenge.â Oh heaven! how was it possible for me To offend thee, Merope, whom evermore My heart revered?âThy strange calamities I from my father learned: and oft, with his, My tears would mingle at the sad recital: An ardent longing to enjoy thy presence My soul conceived. Oft with my aged father I put up vows for thee to heaven; with hands That then were innocent, I often flung Pure incense in the flame that burned for thee Before my humble Lares.âAnd have I Offended thee? Ah punish me: at once I merit it, I ask it, and will have it.â But how, in any wise, could he I slew, Who to ferocity of manners join'd A cruel heart, have reference to thee? ... But perhaps appearances belied his nature: And dire necessity disfigured thus A gentle spirit ... Ah! what have I said? He, if thou pityest him, is innocent; I only am the culprit; ah! on me Wreak, wreak thy vengeance. Me. But what words are these! What lofty sorrow! ... What can all this mean? In spite of my resolve he forces me To weep with him.âThou sayest that thy father Oft spake to thee of me? Ãgis. How many times Of thee, of thy slain consort, of thy sons Did he make mention to me! Me. Of my sons? ... Oh heaven! ... Ãgis. Yes; of three sons of thine, all slain By the atrocious and usurping tyrant, Whose fierce demeanour on this very spot Smote me erewhile with fear. Severity, However unrelenting, shewn by thee, To me were far more grateful than his pity. Me. His words bereave me of all self-command. Scarce do I yield my bosom to compassion, When insupportable and horrid doubts Impel me to revenge: scarce do I cease To feel compassion, when, if I behold, Or hear him, I am reimpelled to tears. Ãgis. What secret conflict hast thou in thy heart? Thou mutterest to thyself? Do I excite Thy pity? Why dost thou not listen to it? Me. Alas! what shall I do? I neither can, Oh youth, condemn thee, nor can I acquit thee. Meanwhile remain within the palace: I, Ere long, once more will see thee. Ponder well; And ponder o'er again within thyself The most minute transactions of thy life: Remember every gesture, look, and word, Of thy antagonist. Recall to mind Also each least expression of thy father.â âBut art thou certain that the good old man Ne'er changed his name? Speak. Ãgis. I am certain of it. E'en when a child I used to lisp Cephisus. When afterwards he told me that he fled An exile from Messene, and commanded, That I from every one should keep this secret, He also would have told his real name, If that had been disguised; full well he knew That even at the risk of my own life, I should have held such a disclosure sacred. I told thee that his birth-place was Messene; But what, oh Queen, can I conceal from thee? Me. Let this suffice; desist from further speech.â I feel constrained to leave thee for a time, To give relief to my long-pent-up tears.â This palace I assign to thee meanwhile As thy sole prison. I again ere long Shall hear thee; and thou shalt repeat the whole: Shalt answer to each question by itself, At length, distinctly, word by word, shalt answer. May I find truth in thee ... But thine is not The aspect or deportment of imposture. SCENE THE FIFTH. Ãgisthus. Ãgis. What can this mean? Whence is it that my words Excite such strong emotions in her heart?â Now with a look more furious than a tyger's Towards me she springs; now she addresses me With more than e'en a mother's tenderness; Beaming with softness, and suffused with pity, Her anxious eyes she fixed on me, and wept. Whence can my slain antagonist awake Such deep affliction in her? Were she not, Had she not long since been, a childless mother, I should suspect that I had slain her son. But yet, who knows? ... Perhaps some adopted child Was dear to her: or perhaps she waited For some one to her projects ... But in vain Are my surmises; I know nothing.âNow, Ãgisthus, thou seest clearly; now thou seest, Whether thy good and aged father spake With truth to thee; âNever debase thyself To look with envy on the great; they are More wretched than ourselves.â ... 'Tis too, too true: Nor ought I now to quarrel with my fate, Whate'er that fate may be, when I behold, A lady so illustrious ... now deserted ... Doomed to a life of such calamity.â But 'tis already night. Since from these walls I am prohibited from venturing forth, To some interior chamber of this palace Let me advance; and cleanse me of this blood. Ah! that I thus could wash away my crime!â But heaven, who knows whate'er I've done, is just: And, if I merit it, let heaven chastise me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Polydore. Pol. Here with the dawn I come: and deem myself Most fortunate that no one saw me enter.â Ah cruel palace, after fifteen years, At length, once more I see thee. Full of fear I left thee, on the day, that in my arms I bore the only son of my good king, The precious remnant of his sacred blood, To a secure asylum: but, impressed With a far different terror I return ... Alas! too certainly this is the girdle Which once Cresphontes wore! This is the clasp; Here is the impress graven by Alcides: This precious pledge my careful hands retained Full fourteen years. Now twenty moons have waned Since to his side I fastened it myself. Ah inconsiderate, and impetuous youth! Thou would'st not hear me; to my wary counsels Thy ears were deaf ... Behold the consequence! ... Oh days of anxious suffering for me! ... Now for a year I've lost thee; and in vain I have already for six tedious months Thy footsteps traced; and now as I approach Thy natal country, on the river's brink, In a retired path, I find thy girdle Drenched in a sea of blood? Ah wretched me! ... What can I now attempt? ... But first I hope To meet with Merope. Ah, may kind heaven, Present me to her, ere I meet the tyrant! This is my only wish. What have I now Left for myself to fear? What life to lose, If of my young Cresphontes I'm bereft? ... And yet, who knows? ... Perhaps I am deceived .. Perhaps ... But how can it e'er be? ... His mother May know of it? ... And if she know it not? ... Ah! how can I ever impart to her Such a dire tale? ... Yet, how conceal it from her? Oh heaven! ... But some one comes; ... Let me fly hence ... But no; a lady hitherward advances; ... Alone advances; ... and she seems to me ... Ah! yes ... 'tis Merope ... Let me accost her. SCENE THE SECOND. Merope, Polydore. Pol. Oh queen! Me. Who in this place can thus address me? ... Who art thou, good old man? What do I see? ... Art thou? ... Do I mistake not? ... Polydore? Pol. Yes ... Me. Speak: my son ... Bringest thou life, or death? Pol. At length again I see thy face ... At length I print a kiss upon thy sacred hand. Me. Tell me ... My son ... Pol. Oh heaven! ...âCan I speak here? Me. Thou may'st speak now; we are unseen by any; I am accustomed, ere the dawn, to go Each morning, unattended, to weep there, Upon the tomb of my adored Cresphontes. Pol. Oh tomb, of the most excellent of kings! Ah! that I there might on it breathe my last! Me. Be quick, and tell me ... Thou dost make me tremble ... Wherefore delay? Wherefore return so sad? Say, hast thou found him? Hast thou traced his steps? Speak: 'tis now six months, since thou quitted'st Elis; Now is the year fulfilled, whose every day Has seemed a day of death. Pol. Unhappy me! Think what is my distress ... Thou never then Has heard of him? Me. Ah no! ... But thou? ... Pol. The half Of Greece I've traversed; love, hope, strong desire, Gave a new strength to my exhausted age: I visited Olympia, Cyllene, Corinth, and LacedÃ¦mon, Pylus, Argos, With many other cities, nor gained once Intelligence of him: his ardent youth, And his adventurous spirit, who can tell How far they may have carried him?âAh, son! ... The wish in thee was evermore too strong To travel, and to learn: oh worthy offspring Of mighty Hercules, my scanty hut Contained thee not. Though thou wert utterly Unconscious of thy birth, each look of thine, Each thought betrayed thee ... Me. When I hear thee speak, What various impulses I prove at once! Ah! where, where art thou, son? ... Thou flatterest not? He grew up worthy of his ancestors? Pol. Worthy? ... Oh heaven! A temper more sincere, More noble, modest, and magnanimous, I never saw: and so well formed in person; In temperament so vigorous; in mien So masculine; and so humane in heart:â What was there not in thee? Sole solace thou Of my old age; my ancient consort lived In thee; in thee alone I also lived: Far more to us, than son ... Ah! among us Had he been seen by thee! ... As if in heart He felt his lofty birth, with gentle sway He ruled us at his will: but evermore That will was just and generous. Ah, my son; The involuntary tears gush from my eyes Whene'er I think of thee. Me. With joy and grief And thou too makest me to weep at once. Oh heaven! ... and when shall I see thee again? Oh when? ... Ah, son, am I then doomed to know Thy many precious qualities, while now I cannot know whither thou wanderest! Pol. What was my suffering never to be able To give thee further tidings of his fate Than that he lived! But confidence was here Most perilous: scarcely dared I dispatch The covenanted token to inform thee That he had left me, and that afterwards I sought to trace his footsteps. Me. Fatal token! Ah! hadst thou never reached me! ... From that day I have had peace no more ... What do I say? ... Peace? ... Ah! thou knowest not ... Tremendous fears, Doubts, apprehensions, and false dreams, or true, By thousands and by thousands shake my soul. No more in quiet sleep I close my eyes: But if, o'ercome by weariness, perforce The lapsed powers of nature briefly drowse, E'en more than joyless vigils, frightful dreams Exhaust what little of my strength remains. Now I behold him as a mendicant Wandering alone, unused to cope with toils, The victim of an unpropitious fate; Clad in a squalid garb, the laughing-stock Of arrogant prosperity, debased By infamous repulses ... wretched me! ... Now I behold him on the brink of death, 'Mid bellowing billows of the vexed sea: Now hand and feet with servile fetters laden; And now assaulted, mangled, massacred, By fierce assassins ... My torn heart, oh heavens! At every instant throbs; and when by chance I hear of men unknown, who have endured The outrages of fortune, I reflect, That each of these may be my son, and tremble. Suspicion working in my sickened heart Swells into credence, and I freeze with terror: And from the thraldom of one agony I cannot rouse my apprehensive spirit, Until a more tremendous one assails me.â Could'st thou believe it? Yesterday a youth That in a private quarrel lifeless fell Upon the river's bank, and afterwards Was, from the fear of him that wrought the deed, Into the river cast, my spirits troubled; And still does trouble them. He was stranger ... Pol. Slain? ... Yesterday? ... A stranger? ... By the stream? ... Oh heavens! Me. But what! thou tremblest? Speak to me. My fears perchance were true? ... Alas! ... thou weepest? ... Thou waxest pale? ... And scarcely canst thou stand? ... Pol. âAlas! What should I do? what say to her? Me. Thou mutterest? Speak to me.âWhat are thy thoughts? What know'st thou? What dost fear? I would hear all: Ah! rescue me from doubt; ... Pol. I cannot speak; Both power and utterance fail me ... Me. I'm o'erwhelmed ... All courage now to question thee is fled ... But yet I will; I will know e'en the worst. Why should I longer languish on in life, If I have ceased to be a mother? Speak; Thou know'st it all; the victim ... Pol. I know nothing ... Me. Speak; I command thee. Pol. Dost thou know this girdle? ... Me. Oh sight! With fresh blood it is reeking yet? ... Oh heaven! It is the girdle of Cresphontes ... I understand ... I ... faint ... Pol. At dawn of day, Erewhile I found it on the river's bank, Swimming in blood: some one was slain there; ah! There is no doubt; it was thy son. Me. What death? ... Oh cruel destiny! ... And I yet live? ... But thou, thus didst thou keep a pledge so sacred? Infatuate that I was! in whom have I Reposed my hopes, my life? Shouldest thou not Have stood inseparably at his side? What weapon should have murdered him, that first Had not cut short thy long and useless life? Say hast thou served me thus? And thus loved him? But, ah! thou weepest? And repliest not? Yes, 'tis the blow of destiny alone: Ah! pardon me, I am a mother ... No, A mother now no more! ... To die ... Pol. Ah me! I merit all thy anger ... Yet heaven knows That faultless ... Me. Ah! my heart forewarned me of it ... In that disastrous night when in thy arms I placed him ... Thou wilt never see him more ... With his infantine hands, so eagerly He clasped my neck; oh heaven, it seemed that then He knew our separation was eternal.â Where are ye fled, ye fifteen years dragged on In tears, in fruitless hope, and racking fear? So many, and so many woes endured, The odious sight of Polyphontes borne, That I at last should lose my all at once? And in what manner! ... And before my eyes! ... By ruffian hands ... deprived of sepulture ... Oh son, dear son, at least thy bloodless corse Should have been given to me! I might at least, Embalming it with tears, and clasping it, Have died upon it. Pol. And I, ... of fifteen years paternal care, Thus to behold myself despoiled? Alas! I come to pierce thy heart ... And yet, ... could I Hide it from thee? Me. To die; nought else remains ... SCENE THE THIRD. Polyphontes, Merope, Polydore. Polyp. Brought hither by the unaccustomed sound Of more than common sorrow, I approach: What may this mean?âSay who art thou, old man? What tidings hast thou brought? Me. Now, quickly come, Oh tyrant, at the sound of woe, of woe, Such as thou heardest in this very palace, The day, that death pursued thy steps. Oh thou, Who with the woes of others feed'st thy heart, Exult now: thou at length beholdest me Utterly desolate. Polyp. Ah!âThen he lived, That son, whom thou affirmedst to be slain? Me. Oh thou unwary tyrant! could'st thou deem, Since I endured to live, my son was dead? What life I led thou knowest; evermore Constrained to see thee ... Yes; he was alive; I hid it from thee; and the only hope I cherished in my breast, was, that one day I here should see him the insuppressive dread Of impious men, the thunderbolt of heaven, The avenger of his father, and his brethren, Of me, and his hereditary throne.â Had this not been, I never had endured To hear thy words one instant, more offensive When they presumed to offer terms of peace, And overtures of execrable love, Than when they threatened me with bonds and death. Polyp. To him who wished thee partner of his throne, Givest thou such recompense? Oh lady, I, Who hear myself by thee proclaimed a tyrant, Am far less fierce than thou. Yes, I knew well, I knew thy son was living; nor didst thou Deceive me ... But, meanwhile thy just distress I pardon: perhaps soon the day will comeâ But art thou certain of this now? Where was This son of thine? And whence does he come here, This messenger? ... Methinks his face is not Quite new to me; methinks ... Pol. Thou knowest me: Attentively survey me; oft hast thou Beheld me in attendance on thy King Cresphontes. I am Polydore. When others To an usurper bent their servile brows, Messene I abandoned. Look at me: These locks, 'tis true, are whiter than they were, This form more bent from length of years, this face By hardships, and by sufferings now impressed With hues of death: but still I am the same; Still thy most mortal foe. I saved from thee My monarch's only son: I nourished him, I educated him; for him resigned My natal soil; and honours forfeited, And wealth, and my loved country lost for him. All these privations were more dear to me Than loftiest rank, with homage to a tyrant.â Alas! why did I not with him expire! ... If thou dost thirst for vengeance on the past, Wreak it on me: leave Merope to weep In liberty; and from my wretched life, Which now is almost spent, deliver me. Nought now afflicts me but that I no more Can give to-day the vigorous years of youth To the pure blood of my legitimate kings. But this the tremulous remnant of my life, Such as it is I offer it, do thou Confirm the sacrifice. Polyp. Thou dost excite My pity, not my wrath: thou hast well done In going thus to voluntary exile. To a rebellious subject I award No other punishment. Thou art criminal, Not for the rescued child, which was indeed A generous enterprize, but inasmuch As thou preventedst not his luckless end. When I discomfited thy lord in fight, It was thy duty, in the camp, that day To take my life, or then to die for him.â Yet now I unreservedly forget Whate'er is past ... But feigned intelligence Dost thou not bring insidiously? Now tell, When, where, and how, he died. Me. Art thou not then Content to know him dead? Would'st thou perchance Also behold him? Would'st thou reassure Thy apprehensive and ignoble heart With the atrocious sight? And view a mother Shed tears of blood upon her lifeless son? Go then, and fetch him from the river's bed, Where not an honoured but a quiet tomb, He has obtained, and drag him through Messene. Insults, which thou could'st not when living give him, Inflict on him now dead; go. He, who was Erewhile assassinated, is my son. Polyp. And shall I trust this tale? Wert thou with him? Say. How? ... Pol. Alas, indeed, I came too late! Ah! this assassin should have slain me with him. I never saw him ... Polyp. How then dost thou know it? Pol. Behold; this is his girdle, formerly The cincture of Cresphontes; with his blood Still is it reeking: in a sea of blood I found it by the river; dost thou know it? Feast on it thy fierce eyes.âA youth, unknown, A stranger, and from Elis ... Oh! could it be That he were not the same! Me. Soon will my death Convince thee that 'tis he. But thou, perchance, That here feign'st ignorance, in that very place His murder didst contrive ... Why say perchance? There is no doubt of it. A short time since Thou tranquilly conversedst with the assassin: Whence sprung that pity which he raised in thee, If not begotten by thy cruel joy? Ah! yes; he was thy messenger ... Polyp. Canst thou Be so deluded, Merope? I swear, I never saw him. If thy son came here Conceal'd, alone, a fugitive, disguised, How could I ever know it? He who slew him, How could he recognize him, if to him, Not less than to myself, he was unknown? Would'st thou have further proofs? Didst thou thyself Not feel compassion for the murderer? Did I not leave him with thee? At thy will Didst thou not question him? The arbitress, Did I not make thee, of his destiny? Me. If thou art not then guilty of the crime, The infamous culprit now is in thy power Within these palace walls. Vengeance alone Can now protract my life a few brief moments. Grant now that I may quickly see him fall Upon the tomb of the unappeased Cresphontes; There, midst a thousand and a thousand torments, Let me behold him, his perfidious soul Breathe forth in death: and then ... Polyp. With equity I might award a recompence to one That slew a vile assassin who approach'd With circumventive arts to murder me. But yet I will myself avenge the death Of my inveterate foe; (thus learn that thou Aspersest me unjustly:) for that death I promise thee a plenary atonement ... Me. Rigorous and unexampled, swift and dreadful, I will that it should be: never till now I ask'd of thee a boon: be this from thee, As 'tis the first to me, the latest favour ... But speak'st thou truly? ... I can scarcely trust thee ... With all the blood of that ferocious man To satiate my eyes ... What do I say? My eyes? I will myself inflict the blow; I will within that heart a thousand times Immerge the dagger ... Ah atrocious heart! That heard my son, with his expiring voice, In lamentable tones invoke his mother ... He heard him, yet he toss'd him in the stream, Perhaps yet half living; perhaps in such a state That even then he might have been deliver'd From death's tremendous jaws ... And he erewhile Recounted this to me; I listen'd to him, And almost thought him innocent; thus more The murderer than the murder'd woke my pity. Pity! Yes, now I will atone for it: Such an example will I make of him As never yet was heard of; I myself,â But thou, tell me, did'st thou not promise it? And wilt thou keep thy word? Polyp. Thou shalt thyself Here speedily wreak on him what revenge Pleases thee best. Ah! might his blood abate Within thy heart the hate it bears towards me! Ah may thy indignation utterly Exhaust itself in him! I fly from hence To execute thy wish: no longer now Will I intrude upon thy just distress; But quickly I return, at least in part, To solace it.âMeanwhile do thou not quit her. Pity in thee I do not reprehend: But for the mother feel it, if thou hast Felt it so much already for the son. SCENE THE FOURTH. Polydore, Merope. Pol. Retire awhile to thy apartments, lady. Permit me, Merope, to avail myself Of the importunate and tardy pity Of the fierce tyrant; at thy feet permit me, Weeping with thee, and speaking of thy son, To breathe my last ... May I see him avenged, And afterwards expire!âCome, lady, come; With grief and indignation thou'rt exhausted, And thy knees fail beneath thy weight. If thou Refusest all repose to thy worn frame, Thou wilt not live to witness that revenge Thy soul so much desires. Me. Ah! may I see it!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Ãgisthus. Ãgis. The king commands that I await him here? My fate is then irrevocably seal'd: Whate'er it be, I fearlessly expect it. My only consolation is to know That I am innocent. Yet evermore (If haply longer life be spared to me) 'Twill be to me in all vicissitudes Haunted by bitter thoughts; eternally That murdered man will flit before mine eyes.â If in my heart I cherish flattering hopes Of pardon, heaven knows why I cherish them. Beloved father! for thyself alone, And once more to behold thee, I desire Protracted life; to restore peace to thee, Of which I robb'd thee; with my pious hands To close thine aged eyes swimming in death: For too assuredly thy failing life Is drawing near a close! ... Ungrateful son! Perchance thyself hast forwarded his death! ... SCENE THE SECOND. Polydore, Ãgisthus. Pol. It seems that Merope is somewhat calm'd, Waiting the tyrant's coming: to that tomb Meanwhile I will repair ... Ãgis. What voice is that? Pol. There offer up my vows ... Ãgis. Heavens! Is it true? Do I behold that venerable man? ... Pol. There shed some pious tears ... Ãgis. I'm not deceived; His snowy locks, his gait, the self-same garb ... Turn this way, good old man ... Pol. Who calls me thus? Ãgis. Ah father ... Pol. Whom do I see? Oh heaven! Thou here? Thou living? Where then am I doom'd to find thee! Ah! hide thyself. I tremble ... Wretched youth! ... Thou art undone. Ãgis. Ah! suffer first that I A thousand times enfold thee to my bosom. Doubtless for me, oh father, thou hast placed Thy feet within Messene, where thou hast So many foes; dar'st thou for me incur So great a risk? ... Oh heaven! an impious son Am I; I merit not such proofs of love: Too much I err'd in leaving thee. Pol. Alas! ... Choak'd by my tears ... I cannot ... speak ... to thee ... Ah, hide thyself ... Fly hence ... Thou art ... Thy risk Is imminent ... How cam'st thou in Messene? ... How in this palace? ... Ãgis. In a luckless hour Thou findest me, oh father: in these walls I am a prisoner ... How my heart is rent In being forced now to confess to thee, That on the very verge perchance I stand Of being sentenced as a homicide To ignominious punishment. Perchance, I yet may be absolved, for innocent I am, although indeed a homicide ... Ah! what a son hast thou regain'd in me! Pol. Oh unexpected destiny! Didst thou Then kill the stranger on the river's brink? ... Ãgis. I kill'd him, yes; but in my own defence. Pol. Oh fatal blow! ... Oh my paternal cares! ... Ah, tell me; ... See if any one can hear us. Ãgis. As far as I can see, no one is near: That passage, which leads hither from the palace, With guards is crowded; but they are remote; They cannot hear us. But what would'st thou say, Oh father, that I do not know already? Behold me, prostrate at thy feet I fall: Ah! long ere this, repentant in my heart, I've wept, and weep again, that I have giv'n thee Such mortal anguish. I know all already. What do I not deserve? How could I quit A father so indulgent and so tender? ... Ah! if I e'er return to see again Our dear domestic hearth, never, oh never, Will I, I swear to thee, one step depart From thy protecting presence ... My loved mother, With her how fares it, say? ... Weeps she for me? ... I seem to hear and see her; ... and I weep ... Pol. Oh son! ... compel me not to shed these tears! ... This is no time for it ... I would ... Ãgis. Reflect: If any one here saw thee? Thou must be To many here well known ... If recognized ... For thee alone I tremble ... To what risk Have I exposed thee! ... Ah! retire with me Where I in weeping pass'd this tedious night; There let me hide thee till the close of day. Ah! if the tyrant should discover thee! ... And at the same time if he should find out That I am thy son! ... Come: yet I feel some hope: For Polyphontes is not now possess'd With rage intractable; and in my cause I found e'en Merope inclined to mercy: Hence I am justified in hoping yet Pardon for my involuntary crime. Pol. Oh Heaven! ... Did Merope herself ... To thee ...â âIt now behoves me that I speak to him Briefly, but fully ... Ah! ... What can I do? ... What say to him? ... And what conceal from him? ... Withdraw thyself at least for a short time. Ãgis. Fruitless were the attempt; I should be sought for; I was commanded to wait here. But why Conceal myself? ... Pol. Thou never didst incur Danger more imminent; nor I e'er felt Such mortal anguish. Merope herself Has sworn thy death: and Polyphontes here Amid his minions comes with Merope. Herself would be thy executioner; For the assassin of her only son Merope deems thee. Ãgis. What have I then done? A son remain'd to her, a son, and I Have robb'd her of him?âAh! come here, come here, Disconsolate mother; thy just wrath appease In this perfidious heart. What punishment, What death, what infamy, deserve I not? Pol. But, ... thou ... art not ... the murderer ... of her son. Ãgis. Then? Pol. Thou art not. Ãgis. But what does this avail? She thinks me so: she is a childless mother, Of her last hope bereft: 'twill be a solace To her distress to sacrifice my life; Then let her come ... Pol. Ah no! ... She of her son Is not bereft. Ãgis. But he, that I destroy'd ...â At all risks I will see her; hear her ... Pol. Fly ... Ãgis. I will not, nor can I ... Pol. Or at least ... Ãgis. But if I am not then ... Pol. Thou art ... that son Whom she laments as dead. Ãgis. I! what say'st thou? ... I am? ... Thou not my father? ... Am I then Sprung from Alcides' blood? Pol. Oh Heaven! ... be silent; Though not my son, to me thou'rt more than son. I rescued thee from hence; I brought thee up Under the feign'd name of Ãgisthus; I Preserved thee, wretched that I am, perchance For a more cruel fate. Ãgis. Oh mystery, Evermore, hitherto, to me profound And unintelligible! For Merope, Whene'er I saw her, in myself I felt I know not what of indefinable, Confused, and unimaginable love; And at the same time felt towards Polyphontes More indignation and antipathy Than ever yet mere tyranny excited. Yes, now I recollect, now I behold, Now comprehend it all. Thy name is not Cephisus. Pol. It is Polydore. At once My name and rank I hid from thee. I fear'd The indiscretion of thy youth: but how Could any one foresee? ... Meanwhile, oh heaven! The hour passes, and ere long ... Ah! if I could Give Merope a timely warning ... Ãgis. Heaven, Which o'er my life hath hitherto alone Seem'd to preside; that Heaven which rescued me, An infant, from the vigilant revenge Of a blood-thirsty tyrant; Heaven which lent The heart of youth to thy old age, the strength, The enterprize, the courage; shall it be That Heaven now leaves me by the very hands Of my own mother to be sacrificed?â Shall I, who am the offspring of Alcides, If there be one who with a sword will arm This strong right hand, shall I permit myself To be demolished by an abject tyrant? Pol. Young man, thou seest nothing but thy valour; But I behold thy danger. To deceive Merope more completely, and abate The general hatred, crafty Polyphontes Now feigns a pity for that very son, Whom, having in his power, he would slay. But if the impious usurper sees him Restored to life, he will at once resume His bloody and ferocious character; And thou wilt fall his victim. Ah! beware; I fly to intercept thy mother's steps: Perhaps yet I may be able ... Ah! if I Arrived in time! ... Ãgis. Methinks that I behold Soldiers advancing hitherward ... Pol. Alas! With Polyphontes Merope approaches ... Ãgis. And after them a train of armed men ... Pol. What shall I do? ... Stand at my side, oh son! ... I swear at least to die in thy defence. SCENE THE THIRD. Polyphontes, Merope, Ãgisthus, Polydore, People, Soldiers. Polyp. Behold, oh Merope, I now commit Into thy hands the murderer of thy son. Let him be manacled with heavy chains; And instantaneously at thy nod expire. Me. Ah miscreant! barbarous and atrocious wretch! Assassin vile! thou hast imbrued thy hands In the pure blood of my beloved son! What now avails it that I spill all thine? Can all thy blood redeem a drop of his? I, who already was so much afflicted! And thou, beyond all women and all mothers, Hast rendered me incomparably wretched!â Rivet those iron chains; prepare for him Horrid and unexampled agonies; And let his labouring soul toil forth in death 'Mid exquisite and long-protracted torments. I will behold his bloody tears gush forth: I will myself inflict on him not one, But thousand, thousand deaths.âAh Merope, Alas! ... Will this restore to thee thy son? Ãgis. Oh Merope, I yield myself to thee: Yes, to a mother willingly I yield, So justly desperate: and if in chains These had not bound me, thou hadst well sufficed To wreak on me what torments please thee best. Just is thy indignation ... Yet thou knowest That guiltless, and e'en worthy of compassion, Erewhile I seem'd to thee. Me. I? ... felt for thee? ... Compassion? ... âYet those accents on my heart, Whence is their unknown power? ... âWhy thus delay? ... What pity do I feel! ... What words were those? ... Let us depart, and drag him to that tomb; The father's shade, and those of his slain sons, May by his blood be pacified; ... and mine; For I shall quickly follow them. Polyp. One instant Be pleased yet to suspend.âSoldiers, and you, Messenians, witnesses I wish you all Of this just solemn act.âClandestinely This angry mother to my detriment Conceal'd a son: yet not the less I feel Compassion for her grief; and I attest The righteous gods, that had she, when alive, With generous confidence reveal'd him to me, I had, e'en as he were a son of mine, Watched his well being, and his tender years Defended with a fond solicitude. Dead, 'tis my duty to avenge that son. Ye hear?âPromptly be Merope obeyed: To such immeasurable wretchedness A single victim is inadequate. Ãgis. Ah! a far different victim is required To appease Cresphontes' shade. Me. What mutterest thou? Let us depart ... Pol. I pray thee, pause a little ... I would impart to thee ... Ah! hear me ... Me. Why Speakest thou thus in whispers? Thou wert once Devoted to Cresphontes; of his son Thou wert the guardian: dost thou now repent Of thy fidelity? And what, dost thou Grieve for the murderer? ... Feel'st thou pity for him? ... And pray'st thou that the blow ... Pol. I ... pity? ... no ... But thou'rt a mother ... Pause ... Now more at length Thou should'st from him himself hear many things Of thy lost son. Polyp. This youth then knew that son? Me. What can I hear?âWhat dar'st thou to propose? Hop'st thou to mitigate my rage? Did he Not slay my son? Didst thou not tell me so? Did not himself confess it? This his belt, Reeking with blood, placed in my hands by thee, Does that not give assurance of the fact? Ãgis. That belt is mine, I swear to thee. Unclasp'd I lost it from my side. Pol. Perhaps there might be Another like to this ... that murder'd youth ... Perhaps he was not thy son ... Me. What new fraud Am I compell'd to hear? ... Ah guilty tyrant! Then hast thou all corrupted? Even him, So faithful to us once? As in defiance Would'st thou the assassin of my son preserve, And feign'st to wish him slain? and means like these? ... Polyp. Oh lady, thou'rt distracted by thy grief. Who cannot here perceive ... Me. If then, in truth, Thou dost desire his death, there now remains No more for me to hear. E'en now I hold My rage restrain'd no longer; all delay Will turn this tide of passion 'gainst myself. Wherefore advance we farther? In these thresholds Where equally my immolated spouse Is witness to the deed, without delay Let him be pacified.âTo me that sword; Myself ... with my own arm to strike thee now ... Ãgis. Bared to thy blow behold my breast. Ah mother! ... Pol. Pause ... Me. Let him die. Pol. Ah! pause ... Polyp. Thus darest thou? ... Me. Perfidious wretch! ... What now? ... Thou weepest, tremblest, And I, I cannot smite him! ... Polyp. What means this? There is some mystery here! Speak, old man, speak. Pol. For pity's sake ... Polyp. Speak. Me. Let me smite him now. Pol. He is ... Me. Who, who? Polyp. Quick ... Speak ... Pol. He is my son. Me. Ah? how? Polyp. This youth thy son? Ãgis. He was my father. Me. He lies.âBut if he were, he slew my son. Thus, die. Pol. Ah! pause ... He is thy son. Ãgis. Oh mother ... Me. Oh heavens! Polyp. Her son? ... Pol. Thou art a mother; save him. Me. My son! ... Polyp. What plot is this? Quick, guards, advance ... Me. I am thy shield, oh son ... Ah, yes, of this My heart assures me: I am yet a mother ... Polyp. Soldiers ... Me. No sword that has not first pierced me Shall touch his form ... Ãgis. I clasp thee in my arms, Oh mother! ... Polyp. Now, what lies dost thou bring here, Thou prating evidence of worn-out fables? An infamous assassin; one that too Denies not that he is such? ... He thy son? ... Shall I believe it? Guards, dispatch him quickly. Me. Infamous thou ... But while I breathe, my son Is safe. Pol. I call the heavens to witness it, He is Cresphontes. That belt is his own: From this alone the error sprung. To you, Messenians, I am known; I am not perjured ... Ãgis. Do none among you recognize my face? Of your illustrious monarch I am now The only representative. Alas! Is there not one that fought beneath his banners In all this multitude? Polyp. He lies. Dispatch him ... Me. Me first ... No, never ... Ãgis. Ah! release my arm; Give me a sword, a sword: by my exploits I shall be quickly recognized. Me. What words! Oh real offspring of the great Alcides! By his deportment, by his lofty speech, Do not ye all now recognize him? Thou, Dost thou not recognize him by thy fear, Oh Polyphontes? Tremble now ... Ah no! 'Tis I that tremble; to the earth I bend My suppliant knees. Ah! do thou yield to pity! This realm of mine, which thou would'st share with me, (At least it seem'd so,) keep exclusively; Let it be always thine. The throne usurp'd, My slaughter'd consort and my sons, all, all I freely pardon thee: except this son, Nothing remains to me in all the world; I ask no other boon; spare him to me ... Pol. Reflect, that in thy unestablish'd realm Thou still hast many foes; that thou canst not, Without a mighty risk, destroy he son. If I deceive thee, take my life. Erewhile Thou didst prepare thyself with so much pomp To avenge her for her son, hoping him dead; He lives, and thou would'st have him slain? Polyp. This youth I might with justice, whosoe'er he be, Sentence to death. But yet, still more and more, Lady, before the eyes of all Messene, I would convict thee of unworthy fraud. He is no son of thine; for thou thyself Sawest thine own son all perish in the flames; And all Messene often from thy mouth Has heard the narrative: all here, with me, Esteem the assertion of this one old man, A renegade, and doubtless bribed by thee, In so important an affair, a proof Ridiculous and vain: yet, while I wait For other more conclusive arguments, I will suppose it true.âRelease him, guards.â Uninjured I restore him to thy arms; Hence to the marriage rites proposed by me I hope to make thee yield ... Ãgis. Oh infamy! Shalt thou contaminate that father's bed Of whom thou hast deprived me? Rather now Slay me upon the spot; 'twere a less evil ... Me. Ah! son; cease now to irritate him more. Who knows what cruel projects he revolves? ... Ah! Polyphontes ... Polyp. Clear this vestibule Of thy auxiliary troops, Adrastes; Let the accustomed guards alone remain, And let the people for a while give way; ... It shall return ... Heardest thou what I said? ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Polyphontes, Merope, Polydore, Ãgisthus, Guards. Me. What has he said to him? ... Oh heavens! ... I tremble! Polyp. Nothing in all the world can save him, lady, But thy consenting to be mine. If yet There lurk some rebel subjects in Messene, I in these walls am undisputed lord. This fable of thy son shall be examined; Should I destroy him, all my after ills Could not to life restore him. A short space I grant to thy reflections.âBefore sun-set, Here, in the presence of my household Gods, Thou shalt have given to me thy hand in marriage, Or here, before thy eyes, I shall myself Have slain this youth. Me. Ah! ... hear me ... Polyp. Chuse.âI leave thee. Invent at will supposititious tales; At least I have ye all within my power.â Guards, whosoe'er of these should try t'escape From this my palace, slay him instantly. SCENE THE FIFTH. Merope, Polydore, Ãgisthus, Guards at the bottom of the Scene. Me. Beloved son! ... My only son! ... I scarce Can think it true ... And would I have destroy'd thee? I? ... Yet my labouring and bewilder'd heart Felt a mysterious check ... But what hard terms Restore thee to me? ... Wherefore thus complain? All terms are easy that restore my son. Ãgis. Ah wretched me! It had been better far That I had perish'd in my infancy. Oh mother, whither, whither do I drag thee! ... Pol. Hear me, oh queen: a dire necessity Constrains thee to submit. The cruel blow Is but delay'd from the perfidious hope Which hath possess'd the tyrant to gain time, And not increase the universal hate. Provided that he can obtain thy hand, He, for a time at least, will hold with thee His hard conditions: but if thou refuse, He will resort to sanguinary schemes, As to the most secure. 'Tis needful now, Now, if it ever was, for thee to shew Thyself a mother, and nought else. 'Tis true, To a dire sacrifice thou doom'st thyself; But for thy son thou dost it ... Me. For his sake What would I not perform? What doubt? ... Ãgis. Oh mother! ... Pol. But, if it be perform'd, there then arise A multitude of hopes. The tyrant feigns; I hope we may anticipate his projects. No sooner will our ancient friends have heard That the last son of their Cresphontes lives, Than they will subtly stratagems devise To rescue him from the perfidious tyrant. If they behold him, what may we not hope! Nothing is wanting to them but a leader ... Ãgis. And I will be that leader. Pol. Yes, oh son ... I dare to call thee by the accustom'd name ... Their leader thou shalt be: within my heart I feel a joyful presage; since the gods Have heretofore vouchsafed to rescue thee From the first violence of the frantic tyrant. Meanwhile, dissimulation for a time Is indispensable; thou, Merope, Affect without reluctance to accept The infamous conditions; 'tis thy duty: Thou, youthful champion, struggle to assume Conciliatory manners, briefly such As to root out from, or, at least in part, Abate suspicion in the impious king; Whence with his own arms thou may'st triumph o'er him; Thou art constrain'd to this, if it concern thee To break those heavy chains assumed for thee By thy devoted mother. Ãgis. Ah! I swear To obey thee; swear at least while I am powerless. Woe if a sword is offer'd to my wrath! Ah then I only listen to my valour, And to the prompting voice of my dead father. Pol. Ah! hold thy peace.âLady, do thou consent, That, in thy name, without delay, I go To the usurper; here consummate art, And prompt decision, are alike required. I shall know better how to feign than thou. Grant thy consent that I may pledge thy hand: Confide in me; I will, if I am able, Obtain at least a temporary respite. If in his wish he persevere, to-day To celebrate the impious nuptial-rites, I place great hopes in the Messenian's aid. Meanwhile do thou thy overweening courage, And thou thy overweening hate, conceal. I feel a mother's tenderness for thee; And furthermore I have a father's sense, And long experience: place in me reliance. Ãgis. Oh father! Me. Speedily, my faithful friend, Depart; dispose of me and my concerns. I, with my son, will hence retire a little. SCENE THE SIXTH. Merope, Ãgisthus. Me. In kissing, and embracing thee, at last Let me indulge myself. Ãgis. At what a price, What horrible price, thou purchasest the blessing!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Polyphontes, Soldiers. Polyp. Merope yields at last.âAdrastes, go, And spread the tidings of my nuptial rites; And now, as far as the amplitude permits, Of this my royal threshold, yield admission To all the most distinguished citizens. At the same time convey to Merope Swift intimation, that I here await her Ready with all her wishes to comply. SCENE THE SECOND. Polyphontes. Polyp. Fortune, propitious hitherto to me, Begins to wear at once a frowning aspect. Can it be true? That, that Cresphontes, thus, Who has so long successfully evaded My persevering and sagacious search, Should now, when I the least expected it, Appear before my eyes? And when to death I justly sentence him, a strange concurrence Of perplexed and inextricable chances, E'en my own ill-advised and feigned compassion, At once condemn, betray, and rescue him. If my career began with artifice, So in its progress I must use address; Till the fit time for arbitrary sway Returns. Messene murmurs: hence must I Affect more frankness and security Towards her in all my conduct. Merope Only consents to these abhorred nuptials, Because she is a mother; and perchance From hence she afterwards expects my ruin ... But I'll anticipate her stratagems. As much as to herself, these rites to me, Are odious: but I thence expect to reap Greater and earlier advantages. Amid the marriage-bed's security, A common table, and a common dwelling, A thousand, thousand means at every moment May be contrived to perpetrate the deed That now I cannot consummate, nor leave, Without great risk, in after times, half done.â SCENE THE THIRD. Merope, Ãgisthus, Polydore, Polyphontes, Soldiers, People, Priests, Victims. Polyp. âOh queen, approach; thus first I give to thee Thy ancient epithet. At last thou yieldest: Oh! may the day be most propitious! Thou seest a festive pomp by me prepared To give due splendour to the solemn act, As far as brevity of time permitted. That every prejudice is laid aside, Severing our mutual interests, I wish The nobles, and the people, priests, and gods, To witness; that to each one is restored His ancient privileges; and that thus A lofty compensation I award For every outrage suffered in my cause. Me. âBut, those, that stand around us, from thy mouth Have heard perchance, that I'm a mother yet? And at what price the life of this my son To me thou yieldest? ... Polyp. Erewhile, in thy name, This old man spake to me another language. What? Art thou changed already? Yet, if thou Desirest to communicate thy thoughts To this august assembly, likewise I Wish it to share in mine. I do not shrink From making free confession of my schemes. Then let Messene hear me.âHere I came A conqueror: to this throne, with this my sword, Where yet my ancestors invited me, I cleared myself a path. Your king subdued Before the victor fell. I, perhaps too fierce In that emergency, suffered his sons To lose their innocent lives: atrocious fruit, But one by custom sanctioned, of success. The throne I gain'd, that throne I still retain; But what a leader, father, judge, and king, To all of you I since have proved myself, Ye all can testify. Within my palace Merope lived in full security; And further, as the consort of a king, Honoured, caressed, and idolized she lived. Yet, well I knew, that to my detriment, For impious vengeance, she preserved a son. Behold this youth whom she proclaims her son; Behold him; see with what design he comes. Me. Behold him, yes: this is Alcides' blood Degraded thus ... Ah traitor! who reduced him To this disgraceful state? Pol. Oh son, restrain Thy just resentment ... Polyp. Yes, surely it is I Who hither drag him in the character Of a perfidious murderer. I that soiled His impious hands with inoffensive blood. Your lofty champion, your young hero, see! Most incontestibly he's proved himself The worthy progeny of Hercules, Who now approached clandestinely to slay me: And with another barbarous homicide Meanwhile his inexpert right-hand accomplished In bloody violence: and lurk'd disguised, In generous ambush, waiting for the hour, When he might find a passage to my breast. Thus, in what character he comes, ye learn; And fraud, or artifice, or accident, Reveals him thus to you. 'Tis in my power To inflict on him the punishment he merits: But my desires for peace are too sincere: From me has Merope implored his life; I yield it to her; solely on condition That she refuse me not her hand in marriage, And thus at length all broils betwixt us cease. Nor this suffices: if this be her offspring, Since other sons I have not, him I chuse My successor.âWhat ought I to do more?â Ought I indeed to do so much as this?â âAnd you, Messenians, heretofore accustomed To the dominion of a hoary warrior, Would you swear fealty to a beardless youth, Nursed in obscurity, to himself unknown, Who hitherto no presage of himself, Or one that is discouraging, hath given; Who ignorant of the arts of government ... Ãgis. Ignorant? I am, 'tis true, of arts like thine; I am not, no, of those Alcides practised: And shall give proofs of this ... Pol. Ah! hold thy peace: Why thus exasperate him? Thou seest it; Too numerous are his satellites: each man, From terror, here is mute. Polyp. No, ye are mute, Messenians, by profound amazement stricken At my incautious lenity. My words, I clearly see, have thoroughly convinced you: And furthermore improvident I seem, Now that to these I wholly trust myself; And since their hearts already have been made To me so manifest. 'Tis true; but yet I wish, whate'er the cost, to make to them A memorable and sublime atonement For my past victory.âNow, Merope, On thy decision I depend: erewhile I gain'd thy suffrage; wouldst thou now retract it? Me. âThis universal petrifying silence But too peremptorily forebodes my doom.â My sonâyes, let my death ensure his life; This duty dictates.âOh thou unavenged, And sorrowing shade of my adored Cresphontes, Pardon the involuntary breach of faith! By thee I was a mother; for thy son To these funereal marriage-rites I come. Oh son, thou call'st me to a bitter trial ... But I am recompensed abundantly, If thou remain'st alive ... Can it be true, That I am thus by violence constrained? ... Oh ye, in former times, of this youth's father The faithful subjects, can ye witness us Reduced to such extremity? ... Polyp. Make haste ... Me. Ah! be not thou incensed: a few words more, And I shall cease to speak.âHear thou, oh son, My latest admonitions. Do thou bend That brow where ineffectual pride sits throned To the despotic conqueror: I, alas! Can only now afford thee an example Of desperate passiveness; and how to bear, With dumb inflexibility, the worst. Now only, by preventing his desires, By silent acquiescence, by attempts To wear at least humility's exterior, By never mentioning thy father's name; Now only by these arts may'st thou perchance Divest his thoughts from blood. Ere long wilt thou See me for ever to the tomb consigned: Do thou meanwhile, though difficult to obey, Carefully treasure up these my last words. Ãgis. Oh wretched mother! ... But can I be persuaded to drag on A life like this, bought at so vast a price? To pine in servitude is not to live To natures such as mine. Do thou live on, Beloved mother; and permit that I Die, at least worthy my exalted father. Polyp. 'Tis past all sufferance, this delay of thine, Oh Merope. The kingdom, perfect peace, Thy son, these I restore to thee at once. Whence are these tears? Hopest thou to excite My subjects to rebellion? I confide In their fidelity. E'en if I would, Each of them now sees clearly that, for thee, I could do nothing more.âResolve; on high O'er the bull's neck the sacred axe impends. Behold my right hand; thine, oh Merope, Is now by me expected as the signal, To immolate the victim to the gods. Me. What am I doing? ... Oh despair! ... Oh day! ... Oh terrible moment! ... Here's my right hand then ... But, oh! distracted, bloody, menacing, Cresphontes interposes! ... Where am I? ... Ah! ... whither shall I fly? ... Messenians, pity ... Ãgis. Oh rage! and shall I suffer this? ... Pol. Be silent! ... On thee already does the tyrant dart His rabid eyes ... Polyp. No more. Yet once again, Oh lady, do I offer it to thee: Behold my right hand. Me. Oh distraction! ... Mine ... Ãgis. Die thou. Having seized the axe from the hand of the priest, he darts towards Polyphontes, and levels him to the earth with a blow. This is the right hand due to thee. Pol. Audacious youth! Me. What do I see? Ãgis. Die thou. He repeats the blow. Polyp. Oh treason! ... Guards ... I die ... Guards. He is a traitor; Slay him. People. No! rescue him; he is our king. The people assault the guards. Me. He is my son, I swear to you; your king ... Ãgis. Far other proofs will I give you of this. And this my single hatchet shall disperse Javelins and swords. He darts among the combatants. Me. Messenians, ah defend him ... Pol. I breathe again ... Behold the tyrant's troops Already are dispersed ... Me. Oh son, return! ... Ah wretched me! ... Pol. Through blood I will pursue him: Had I my youthful arm! But, for his sake, I will lay down my life.âAh! hear me, son: Return: rush not so rashly forward; ah! Let me alone perish in thy defence ... Ãgis. At length we've conquered them. Rejoice, oh mother; Thou seest the mercenary soldiers fly, Fly to a man: Adrastes, by my hands, Lies lifeless; and the citizens in crowds Flock more and more ... Me. He is my son, Messenians! He is Cresphontes; he is your true king: Do you not recognize him by his face, His voice, his looks, his unexampled valour, And, more than all, by my maternal love? ... Pol. And by my oath which now confirms her words? Oh you, Messenians, by my hoary looks, By my integrity well known to you, By the remembrance of that great Cresphontes, Rather to us a father than a king; I do conjure you yield implicit faith To my asseveration. I myself Rescued him from Messene; brought him up ... Ãgis. Messenians, there, stretched lifeless on the earth, (Do you behold him) Polyphontes lies: I slew him; I alone avail'd to avenge My father, and my brothers, and my mother, Myself, and you: if hence I guilty seem To you, I yield myself to you alone.â Behold, the axe, which for such deeds sufficed, I cast it on the earth: behold me now Wholly defenceless, wholly in your power: If I have shed the blood of these unjustly, Be mine in retribution shed by you. People. Oh generous, noble youth! In every thing His father he resembles ... Me. And in him Cresphontes lives again ... People. Auspicious day! ... Thou art our rightful king. Pol. And worthy king.
