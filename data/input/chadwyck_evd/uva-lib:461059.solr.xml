      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A WILD SEA-COAST WITH OVERHANGING CLIFFS. Enter KING EGERIO, clad in skins, raging violently, LAOGHAIRE, POLONIA, LESBIA, and the CAPTAIN endeavouring to restrain him. KING. Let me cast my life away! LAOGHAIRE. My lord, detain thee! CAPTAIN. Listen! LESBIA. Look! POLONIA. O stay! KING. Let me from this point that shines afar, Upraised in Heaven, which with one brightest star Its rugged brow is crowning, Down, where the rocks above the waves are frowning, There 'mid the wild salt billows let me lie, And as I raging live, so raging die. LESBIA. To the seaâwhat madness press'd thee? POLONIA. In thy sleep, my lord, what fear possess'd thee? KING. Every torment that doth dwell For ever, with the thirsty fiends of hell, Children of that monstrous mother, Which, from out seven scaly necks, doth smother The fourth sphere of death, Clouding it o'er with pestilential breath; All its horror, all its wild unrest, Were locked within my breastâ So that against myself I wage unnatural strife, For terror is the master of my life, And such the torment of its dread alarms, I lie a living corse in slumber's arms, And all the dreams that round me wait, Are but the pallid messengers of fate. POLONIA. What so much provoked thee in thy dream? KING. Ah! my daughters, listen: there did seem From out the lips of a most lovely youth (And though a miserable slave in sooth, My hand against his life I durst not raise, Being then compelled to spare, as now to praise,) Well, from the lips of this poor slave there came A gentle flame, Which with a mild and lambent lustre blew, And when it touched ye two, Within the living fire I saw ye burned, But, though I was between ye, me it spurned; And when to stay its rage I sought, The fire would touch or wound me not, So that from that dream's abysm, From that paroxysm, From that lethargy of death I broke, And in blind despair awoke. And my terror still is such That flying, at each step I seemed to touch Once more that dreadful fire, But now I also burn, as ye expire! Egerio's Dream, as given by Calderon, agrees substantially with Jocelin's description, and differs only in one slight particular (the number of the flames) from that in Bouillon's Vie de St. Patrice. In the latter, the name of the Irish prince to whom Patrick was sold is not given; in Jocelin he is called Milcho: Calderon was either ignorant of this, and gave the king a name that was purely imaginary, or, considering it less musical than he would wish, gave him the more harmonious one of Egerio. The following is Jocelin's version: âAnd Milcho beheld a vision in the night: and behold Patrick entered his palace as all on fire, and the flames, issuing from his mouth, and from his nose, and from his eyes, and from his ears, seemed to burn him; but Milcho repelled from himself the flaming hair of the boy, nor did it prevail to touch him any nearer; but the flame, being spread, turned aside to the right, and catching on his two little daughters, who were lying in one bed, burned them even to ashes: then the South-wind blowing strongly dispersed their ashes over many parts of Ireland.ââPp. 17, 18. Jocelin's Life of St. Patrick, translated by Swift. (Dublin, 1804.) LESBIA. These are phantoms light and vain, Mere chimeras of the brain, Coming through the gate of dreams, When the body lieth numbâ [A trumpet sounds. But what trumpet's this? CAPTAIN. It seems Vessels to our port have come. POLONIA. Let me go, my lord, since thou Knowest how my heart doth leap and bound When I hear a trumpet's sound, And a flush comes deepening o'er my brow, And my whole frame doth rejoice, As at a siren's voice; Since inclined to arms and warlike deeds, Music's martial clangour stirs my soul, So that I cannot control My emotion; may the fame Soon be mine, that ever valour breeds When my wafted name shall run To the ever-glorious sun, Sailing on a thousand waves of flame; Or, on swift wings o'er the azure air, Rivalling the goddess Pallas there!â 'Twas but to know, I this excuse contrived, [Aside. If this is Philip's ship that has arrived. [Exit. LAOGHAIRE. Come, my lord, descend with me To the white fringe of the rolling sea, Which doth humbly bow its curled head To this mountain, lone and dread; Which, because it proudly braves The sea and storm must ever dwell In a lone and sandy cell, Guarded round by crystal waves. CAPTAIN. Come, and all your cares forget, At this snowy monster's sightâ Like a sapphire mirror set In a rich frame, silver white. KING. Nothing now can bring relief, Nothing now can wean me from my grief, Or expel that ever-torturing guest, From out the burning Etna of my breast. LESBIA. Is there any earthly sight more fairâ Can the world this miracle surpassâ Than to see a vessel softly gliding, Like a plough the azure field dividing, Or go breaking through the crystal glass, With the light breeze for its willing slave, Like a bird upon the rippling wave, Or a fish within the yielding air? Favourite of sea and sky, It through the winds doth swim, and o'er the waves doth fly, But that sight were dreadful now, Full of terror and affright, For the sea is altered quite; And the mountain billows roar, And the ocean's lordly brow, Is all deeply wrinkled o'er!â Neptune from his rest awaking, And his dreadful trident shaking, And his angry visage baring, Trieth now the sailors' daring. Now the storm begins to rise, Howling round the starry dome; All is altered in a trice, Pyramids of shining ice, Snowy palaces of foam, All are dashed against the skies. POLONIA, entering. POLONIA. Alas! alas! KING. Polonia, speak. POLONIA. This fickle Babylon that tries In its thirsty rage to seek Even the dark and distant skies, Hides in its remorseless womb Myriads who for ever rest, Each within his coral tomb, Deep below the troubled wave, In a shining silver cave: Now the God by rage possess'd, Has loosed the winds and let them fly, Raging over sea and sky; Rushing o'er the waters dark, They have struck the wretched barkâ She whose trumpet late did sound Like a swan's funereal noteâ I, who then a pathway found Up that steep stupendous cliff, Which upon the shore remote, First receives the orient ray, There I saw a mighty ship Tossing like a summer skiff On the waters cast away, As the masts did rise and dip, Saw I Philip's banners wave O'er the sinking vessel's grave; Then I added more and more, To the waves and tempest's roar, By the gushing tears and sighs Bursting from my lips and eyes!â KING. Immortal rulers of the sky Why so much my patience try With such threatened ills as these? Do you wish that I should seize On the sceptre and the crown Of thy conquered kingdom? Lo! Thither shall I surely rise, And with vengeful hand tear down The azure palace of the skies! Being a second Nimrod. So That the world by me, perchance, May escape its threatened doom. Vainly may the billows roll, Vainly may the thunders boom, Vainly may the lightning's glance, They shall never shake my soul! PATRICK, within. Ah! me. LAOGHAIRE. Some mournful voice; KING. Who can it be? CAPTAIN. Struggling through the cruel sea, One strong swimmer seeks to save His life from out the stormy wave. LESBIA. And his arms I see him stretch To another sinking wretch, Even in the jaws of death. POLONIA. Stranger, whoso'er thou art, Whom the furious tempest's breath, Or a cruel fate, hath sent To this lone and distant part, Hither let thy course be bent, If thou canst my accents hear, May they o'er the waters be A vocal polar-star for thee! Enter PATRICK and LUDOVICO, dripping with wet, and clinging to one another; as they enter, they fall exhausted on the stage. PATRICK. Aid me, O God! LUDOVICO. The Devil rather Aid me! LESBIA. I'm moved to pity, father. KING. That am not IâI know not what it is. PATRICK. If misfortunes are a test Wherewith to try the coldest, flintiest breast; Say, can there here be found a heart like his, Who would not down his pitying eyes incline To such misery as mine? A wretched, shivering, shipwrecked castaway, Pity, for God's sake, at thy feet I pray. LUDOVICO. I ask it not, for never more can I Seek it from man, or hope it from on high. KING. Say who you are, we then shall know If we can pay the debt we oweâ The common debt of food and careâ But first my name I shall declare, Lest ignorance of it might lead Your lips some idle deed to do, And words perchance be spoken, freed From the respect that is my dueâ I am the King Egerio; lord Of this small kingdom's island throneâ 'Tis small because 'tis mine: until The throne of all the world I fill I must mistrust my valorous sword! In savage skins you see me drest, Not in a monarch's regal vest, Because without, I wish to wear, In this wild wolfish robe of hair, Some emblem of the heart I bear! The name of God is here unknown, In prayer we neither kneel nor sigh, Our only creed is this alone That we are born, and we must die. Now that you know my greatness and my name, Say who you are and why you hither came. PATRICK. Attend, O Monarch! Patrick is my name, My country Ireland, and my native village A place so poor as to be scarcely known; Between the north and west remote it lies Upon a mountain, which the watchful sea Girdles around as with a prison wall: 'Tis in this isle, which will be called, O King! To its eternal praise, the Isle of Saints, So many here will piously give up Their lives as holy offerings for the faith, That truest test of pure and faithful soulsâ My father was an Irish cavalier, My mother, his chaste spouse, a child of Gaul, To them I owe, even in my youngest days, (More than my life) the nobler gift of faith, And early entrance to the Church of Christ. The holy rite baptismal gave me these, That gate of Heaven, and the first sacred boon The Church doth give her children: by my birth, My pious parents having all fulfilled The duties that they owed the married state, They each to separate convents then retired, Where in the purest chastity they spent Their lives, until the fatal hour arrived Which calls the blessed spirit to the skies, And gives the body to its kindred earth: I then became an orphan, and was placed Beneath a holy matron's watchful care, But scarce had I my first brief lustrum filledâ Scarce had the sun five times in splendour sailed In golden circles through the heavens, illuming Twelve starry signs and one terrestrial zoneâ When God was pleased to show in me a sign Of his omnipotence; for he doth choose Most feeble instruments, that men may give The glory and the praise to Him alone; Upon a day (and Heaven doth know, I tell These wonders unto you through no weak pride, But that God's name be praised), upon a day, The blind man Gormas came unto my doors: God sent me here, he cried, and He commands That you do give me sight. Immediately Moved at the man's obedience, I did make The sign of the cross upon his sightless balls, And with the touch, the blessed vision came And chased the darkness from his wondering eyes. Another time, when thick clouds hid the skies Which warr'd with snowy arrows 'gainst the earth, So many on a neighbouring hill had fallen That when they felt the rigour of the sun, And melted, such a flood throughout Our village ran, that all the houses seemed Like ships of brick or stone above the waves, (Who before this saw ships on rugged hills, Or sail amid the grassy inland woods?) Upon the waves I made the holy sign, And with suspended tongue, in God's great name Bade them retire, and lo! the land was dry! O mighty Lord! who will not speak thy praise! Who will not own and worship thee, O God! Much greater wonders I could tell thee: but Modesty comes and bindeth fast my tongue, And chains my voice, and sealeth up my lips. I grew in fine, inclining every day More to the love of science than of arms; And, above all, gave myself up entire To pious readingâto the lives of those Called to be saints by Godâa school wherein Religion, Charity, and Faith are taught: Engaged in this pursuit, one day I went, With some companions to the lone sea-shore; Thither a ship came, from whose dusky womb Leap'd armed men, pirates they were, who prowl'd In search of prey about those seas; they made All of us prisoners, and to keep the prize, Hoisted their sails and stood to the open sea. Philip de Roqui was this vessel's chief, A man who nourished in his heart the pride That afterwards would work him direful woe. Some days he spent in prowling thus around The land and sea of all the Irish coast, And blood and treasure followed in his wake: Me alone he kept, desiring, as he said, To offer me a tribute unto thee, Here in thy very presence, as thy slave: (How vain and false are all the hopes of man, That are not based upon God's blessed will!) This very day upon the smiling sea, In sight of land, did Philip speak his wish, The air was mild, and gentle was the wave, And yet in one brief moment did he see His proud presumption shattered: For the wind Roared in the hollow bosoms of the waves, A cry of pain burst from the angry sea, Billows, like mountains upon mountains piled, Pass'd thundering by, whose white and foaming tops Moisten'd the sun, and quenched his dazzling light! The lantern on our mast, joined to the skies, Seemed like a comet or an exhalation, Or like the strange course of a shooting star; Another time, amid the deeps profound It touched the sands, when the divided waves Showed alabaster monuments around, 'Mid coral banks and caves of shining pearl: I on whom Heaven bestowed (I know not why, Being so useless) more of strength and breath Than mine own safety needed, was empowered To aid this valorous youth, to whom my heart Was drawn by some most potent influence, Which he with interest will yet repay! At length, through favour of kind Heaven, we reached The shore, and whether fortune good or ill Awaits us, we confess ourselves your slaves: May our grief move you, may our bitter tears Soften your hearts, and may our whole affliction Gently compel you to relieve our woe. KING. Cease, miserable Christian, for my soul Charm'd by thy voice, knows not what subtle power Compels it both to venerate and love you, Imagining that you the slave must be, Whom lately in my fearful dream I saw, Breathing out flames and sparks of living fire, In whose alluring light, like summer flies, I saw my hapless daughters both expire! PATRICK. The flame that issued from my mouth is that True doctrine of the Gospelâis the Word Which I must preach to you and to your people, By means of which your daughters will become Children of Christ. KING. Be silent! close thy lips, Thou miserable Christian, for thy words Affront and wound me. LESBIA. Oh! be calm, my lord! POLONIA. Wilt thou, in pity, speak in his defence?â LESBIA. Yes. POLONIA. Nay, rather let him die. LESBIA. It is not just That by a monarch's hands he perish. Ah! [Aside. If truth were told, not that alone doth move My heart to pity these poor shipwrecked Christians! POLONIA. If this second Joseph to the king, Like him of old, interprets dreams, do not, My lord, have any fear of their effects; For if that fancied and unreal flame Portend that I a Christian should become; It is a sheer impossibility, as great As if being dead, I should return again And live and breathe a mortal as beforeâ But to distract your thoughts from fears like these, Now let us hear the other traveller's tale. LUDOVICO. Listen, most beautiful divinity, For thus begins the story of my life. Great Egerio, king of Ireland, I Am Ludovico Enioâa Christian alsoâ In this do Patrick and myself agree And differ, we being Christians both, And yet as opposite as good from evil. But for the faith which I sincerely hold, (So greatly do I estimate its worth) I would lay down a hundred thousand livesâ Bear witness, thou all-seeing Lord and God! No simple tale of piety is mine, Nor wonders worked by Heaven's permission through My favoured handsâfar differentâall crimes, Theft, murder, treason, sacrilege, betrayal Of dearest friends, all these I must relate, For these are all my glory and my pride! In one of Ireland's many islands I Was born, and much do I suspect that all The planets seven, in wild confusion strange, Assisted at my most unhappy birth. The fickle moon gave me inconstancy, Mercury gave me genius ill employed, (Far better not to have received the gift!), Lascivious Venus gave me siren passions, And ruddy Mars a hard and cruel mind. (What will not Mars and Venus jointly give?) The Sun conferr'd upon me rank and stateâ Which to support I scrupled not the means, Jupiter gave me pride and lofty thought, And Saturn blended in my complex nature Rage, anger, valour, and a ready mindâ And fitting fruits have grown from out these seeds. My father, being for certain secret reasons Banish'd from Ireland, came with me to live At Perpignan in SpainâI was a boy Of ten years old, and when six more had passed He diedâmay heaven for ever be his home! An orphan I remainedâa willing prey To all my fanciesâall my wild desiresâ And thus without a rein or curbing check, Ran headlong o'er the wide alluring plainâ The two poles of my life were love and play, On which the rest were balanced, what they were As a foundation you can now behold. In long detail my tongue would not suffice For all my actionsâthis is but a sketch: To force a tender damsel to my wish I slew a noble venerable man, Her fatherânay an honoured cavalier I stabb'd (through frenzied passion for his wife) As he lay sleeping calmly by her sideâ Bathing his dearest honour in his bloodâ Making his bed a fatal theatre, And mingling there adultery and deathâ Husband and father both gave up their lives Martyrs to honourâfor it has its martyrs Even as Religionâmay the atoning Heaven For ever guard their souls in endless rest!â Flying from punishment I entered France, Where long my name and actions shall be known; For flinging myself at once into the war, Which between France and England then was waged, I found occasion to display my valour, And soon obtained even from the king's own hands A captain's standardâin what way the debt I soon repaid I shall not now relateâ Thus honoured, I returned to Perpignan,â And gaming in a guard-house for some trifle, I struck a serjeant, killed a captain, And in my fury wounded several moreâ Attracted by the noise, the guard approached To make me prisoner, when in self-defence, I slew a bailiffâmuch too small amends For all the other evils I had doneâ May God receive his soul in lasting bliss! At length I fled into the fields, and found Asylum in a sacred convent's walls, Which in that desert far away was built, There I lay retired, with kindest care Attended even by one of the religious, A lady of my kindred, who for this Discharged that duty. Like a basilisk, My bosom turned the honey into poison And wildly rushed from liking to desire! Desire! that monster which doth ever feed On the impossibleâthat living fire That groweth by resistanceâthat strange flame Which the wind kindlesâthat dissembling foe Which killeth its own master. In a word, Desire, unawed by God or sacred things, Imagines all that's horrible or vile But to be it: in fine, my lord, I dared:...... Moved by the recollection here my voice Grows muteâthe frightened accent fails, My shattered heart in throbbing seems to leap From out my breast, as when in dusky shades The beard and hair, in terror, stand on end:â Confused, and doubtful, sad and full of thought, I scarcely have the courage now to tell The deed I had the courage then to do, So horrible and hateful is my crime, So sacrilegious and profane, that Iâ Even I, repent me sometimes of the deedâ In fine, I dared, one night when starry silence Doth build for men brief sepulchres of sleep, When heaven doth wear the mournful veil of grief, Wherewith the wind doth hang the widow'd skies, For the sun's death, whose obsequies are sung By nightly birdsâwhen trembling stars fling back Their clear reflection to the parent skies From sapphire waves. At such a time as this I entered by the garden-wall, assisted By two companions (comrades never fail In such adventures), and 'twixt fear and horror, I reached the cell of her I must not name; She, horrified at such wicked boldness, Fainted upon the ground, from which she passed Into my arms, and ere her sense returned, She was far off beyond the convent wall, Where if Heaven could have given her timely aid, It did not. Women if they're once convinced That man's excesses are the fruit of love Easily pardon them: and thus, delight Replacing sorrow, she for a little while Escaped the misery of her wretched stateâ Although were centred in her hapless person The scaling of a cloister's sacred walls, Violence, incest, ravishment, adultery, Towards God himself, since she was vowed his spouse, And to crown all, unheard-of sacrilege; From out the desert where we first had gone, On rapid steeds, the children of the wind, Towards Valentia then we took our wayâ Where, feigning that she was my wife, we lived Some time with little happiness or peace. My money being exhausted, without friends Or hope of succour, I was base enough To think of turning to a vile account The beauty and the honour of my wife. (Had I not bade a long farewell to shame, This act alone would make meâfor it is The lowest depth even of the vilest breast To make a public traffic of one's honour, And put a price upon our dearest joy). As soon as I with shameless face proposed This foulest project, she appeared content, But hid her true resolve within her breast, But scarcely had I turned my back upon her, When, flying from me as from one infected, Once more she sought asylum and repose Within a convent; where, advised by one, A holy priest, again she closed the gate Of torment and the worldâand then she died, Leaving to all a wonderful example Both of her penitence and crime.âMay God Receive her, also, to eternal rest! I seeing that the hard, censorious world Took notice of my crimesâthat every spot Whereon to rest would slip beneath my feet, Resolved to go into my native country As an asylum from my enemies. Upon the journey I set out, and soon Reached Ireland, which received me as a son, But soon a very stepmother became; For scarcely had I reached a sheltered bay, Than I was made a prisoner by some pirates Who lay therein concealed. Their general Was Philipâwho, to show his admiration Of the most brave resistance that I made, Gave me my life. What still remains you know. You know how late the angry wind rose up And flew with threatening fury round our ship; And made such ruin 'mid the seas and mountains, That all their usual wildness seemed but tame Compared to it. With catapults of crystal It struck the firm foundations of the land, And neighbouring cities fell within the wave. The sea o'er all the coast flung out its store Of tinted pearls, which the swift breath of morn Engenders from the dew, whose drops are tears Of fire and ice.âBut not to lose more time In vain descriptions, all our crew went down To sup with Satan; I, who was also asked, Must have gone too, had not good Patrick here (Whose face, I know not why, I always view With love and terror mingled with respect), Had he not drawn me from the poisonous wave Where I was drinking death in every draught. This is my history; and now, nor life, Nor pity I requireâI do not wish These latter griefs should even move your hearts; If thou wilt give me aught, then let it be Death only, for a man so bad as I Can never hope to reach to any good. KING. Ludovico, though you are a Christian, Which I abhor with every other truth, I so admire your valour, that in you And Patrick I will now display, Even at the self-same moment, all my power; As I can elevate, so can I humble, As I can punish, so can I reward; And thus while unto you I stretch my arms In token of protectionâunto you I lift them but to fling you to the earth Beneath my feet (not balanced are the scales). [He flings PATRICK on the ground and places his foot upon him.] But that you, Patrick, may perceive how much I value all your threats, your life I spareâ Go breathe in fire the Word of God, thou'lt find I neither worship his divinity Nor fear his wonders. Live, then, but in some Obscure and menial state, and as thou art Unfit to share the glorious toils of war, Here in these valleys must thou spend thy days, Tending my flocks and herds, that browse around. We soon shall see if thou canst spread that fire Of which thou speakest; or if, being my slave, Thy God will free thee from captivity. [Exit. LESBIA. The sight of Patrick moves my heart to pity. [Exit. POLONIA. For me I know no pity. If I did, I think 'tis Ludovico would awake it. [Exit. PATRICK. When, Ludovico, on the ground I lay, And saw you raised at once to Fortune's height, 'Twas grief, not envy, it awoke within meâ You are a Christian, oh! be one indeed. LUDOVICO. Patrick, allow me to enjoy the bliss That Fortune offers. PATRICK. This one boon I askâ LUDOVICO. What is it? PATRICK. That, alive or dead, we meet In this world once again. LUDOVICO. Dost thou demand So strange and dread a promise from me? PATRICK. Yes. LUDOVICO. I give it to thee, then:â PATRICK. And I accept it. [Exeunt. SCENE II. âTHE COTTAGE OF JUAN PAUL, NEAR THE SEA-SHORE. Enter PHILIP and LUCY. LUCY. Forgive me if I have not known To serve and tend you as I oughtâ PHILIP. A great deal more, I frankly own, Must I forgive than you have thoughtâ For even thy face, on which I live, Awakes not bliss without alloy, So for the mingled grief and joy I must be grateful and forgiveâ And thus, in curious pleasing strifeâ Two feelings in my breast have strivenâ Your beauty, and your care have given The pang of deathâthe throb of life. LUCY. Too rude and ignorant am I For all the ingenious things you've said, And so I give my arms instead, Which saves the trouble of replyâ Though silent they will speak to thee Of all with which my heart is rife. PAUL enters and sees them embracing. PAUL. O heavens! what sight is this I see! [Aside. A man embracing my own wifeâ What shall I do? I burn! I burst! I ought to kill them; yes, 'tis clear That is my dutyâbut I fear That she, perchance, might kill me first. PHILIP. Beautiful mountaineer, deny Not thou to take the ring I wearâ Would it could be, for all thy care, The fairest star of yonder sky! LUCY. Pray do not think me one of those Who of their kindness profit make; But I accept it for thy sake. PAUL. Being her husband, I suppose [Aside. My duty is to hold my tongue; But had she not received the ring, Of course it were another thing. LUCY. Again, these clasping arms among, My very soul I give to theeâ I have no other gem or chain. PHILIP. And there I ever could remain, The prison is so sweet to me; As at the rising of the sun, Night's shadows flyâso here I know No more the memory of the woe These cruel crystal waves have done. PAUL. Ah! he embraces her again! [Aside. Good sir, think what my soul endures,â This woman is my wife, not yours! PHILIP. Your husband's hereâI think 'tis plain He sees usâit is best I go, And presently return again. Oh! sweet Polonia, couldst thou know [Aside. The abject state to which I'm cast, Thou'dst feel some pity for my pain!â And thou, O heaven-aspiring main! Roused raging up by storm and blast, Where hast thou hid? in what far tomb, The myriad lives that fill thy womb? [Exit. PAUL. This silence will do little good, [Aside. I'll speak aloud.âMy Lucy dear! My life! methinks it doth appear I've caught you now!âthis piece of woodâ A good stout window-bar it isâ Will do for vengeance. LUCY. Bless me! say What new suspicion, spouse, is this? PAUL. Is it then mere suspicion, pray, Or chance, to see you o'er and o'er Embraced before my face? LUCY. Indeed It is suspicion, nothing moreâ It must be soâbecause, if you The duties of a husband knew, You'd only see where'er you went, One half your wife might do. PAUL. Agreed! To that condition I consent, And as I saw you twice embrace That rascal of a soldier, whom The sea has flung from out its womb, I shall not in the present case Be too exact, but for the nonce, Think you embraced him only once. And as I meant to give to you A hundred blows, 'tis only fair That I divide the whole by twoâ So fifty is your proper share. And so by sacred Heaven I swear! Since you yourself the sentence gave, And since the reckoning is so clear, Not more than fifty blows you'll have. LUCY. It is too muchâno man should strive, By any means to hear or view More than a fourth his wife may do. PAUL. Well let it be a fourth; for it The blows you know are twenty-five, These I will pay. LUCY. It is not fit Men know so much. PAUL. Ah! something new!â How much then, pray? LUCY. Between us two, Henceforth I think it just and right You only see what I allow, And trust my word and not your sight. PAUL. Dear daughter of the devil! thou Convinceth me, and so 'tis plain The stick no longer should remain With me; so let us change our places, Here is the stick, 'tis now for thee To give the hundred blows to meâ And to the other the embraces. Enter PHILIP. PHILIP. I hope the clown has gone away. [Aside. PAUL. Ah! SeÃ±or Soldier! you have come Just in the nick of timeâalthough The debt of gratitude I owe To you is such a mighty sum I never can the debt repayâ For all the honour you to-day Intended for my wife and cot, How poor were all that I could say? Yet still a fancy now has got Into my head, that it were best You went upon your homeward wayâ Go! in God's name, without delayâ Since you are strong with food and rest; As I don't wish to raise my hand Here in my house in strife 'gainst thee, Or that (almost a fish at sea) You should be left dead meat on land! PHILIP. This is suspicion, do not doubt it, Which has no true foundation gotâ PAUL. Well then, with reason or without it, Am I a husband, Sir, or not? Enter LAOGHAIRE, an old countryman, and PATRICK as a slave. LAOGHAIRE. My orders are, that you should take This slave, and make him tend the sheep Out in the fields. OLD MAN. Leave all to me. LAOGHAIRE. But, bless me! am I quite awake, Or is it but a dream of sleep, That Philip here I seem to see? Permit me, mighty lord, to press Your feet. PAUL. Is't âLordâ he calls him? LUCY. Yes; Now give the hundred blows, my Paul. PHILIP. Come to my arms, thou good Laoghaire. LAOGHAIRE. You do me too much honour there, But how does it chance you live at all? PHILIP. Cast on this shore so wild and bare, A wretched monument of chance, I would full soon have surely died, But for these peasants' friendly careâ I thought it best some time to abide Their guest, amid these lonesome haunts, Until I found my strength renewed, And learned the temper of the king; Here I had lived till time might bring (My royal master's wrath subdued) Some sorrow to his soften'd breast For my supposed disastrous fate; Then I might go with heart elate And trust forgiveness for the rest. LAOGHAIRE. Consider that already gained, And all his stormy wrath blown o'er, Thy strange escape will glad him more Than even thy fancied death had pained; Come to the king, I'll lead the way; You'll find how changed doth fortune blow. PAUL. May't please your lordship, ere you go, Permit me just a word to sayâ My name, my lord, is Juan Paul, Pray let my vile suspicions pass, In truth I was a very ass, To talk of such a thing at all; My heart for pardon humbly craves, But for the rest of my poor life, Pray think my cot, myself, and wife Your lordship's very humble slaves. PHILIP. For your great kindness and attention, I hope some future time to pay. PAUL. A word of that pray do not mention, But, if you wish it, there's a way By which you can a boon confer On Lucy and myselfâ'tis this, Vouchsafe to take her with you, do; She will be glad to be with you, And I too happy without her. [Exeunt PHILIP and LAOGHAIRE. LUCY, aside. Well, was there ever such a miss? My tender hopes are all o'erthrownâ Gone like the light of morning mist, Even when born! OLD MAN. We are alone, Friend Paul, and now I think you ought Sometimes this tender youth assist; He'll need it. PATRICK. Ah! good sir, do not Think of my state or me too much. God wills that I should be a slave; As such I'll serve youâand I crave That you will treat me even as such. OLD MAN. How modest! PAUL. How humble! LUCY. And how handsome too! His face affects me greatly. PAUL. Say (And let it be between us two), Is there a solitary case, In which a stranger pass'd this way You did not take a fancy to? LUCY. Ah; it is plain you're jealous still, You think that I'm inclined to fall In love with the whole human race. OLD MAN. I have a weighty charge, friend Paul, To trust you with. PAUL. You know my skill; Say on. OLD MAN. This slave, that here you view, I much suspect is not secure; I wish to guard him wellâbe sure You'll know the cause ere long. To you I give him now in strictest charge; Let him not stray, unwatched, at large, Or, unattended, roam about. [Exit. PAUL. A very pleasant task, no doubtâ It seems I'm placed to watch you here, [To PATRICK. The only thing in all my life, I had to watch (except my wife)â The duty's troublesome. I fear I now can neither sleep nor eat; But should you wish to use your feet, And go away, the coast is clear. In truth I'll rather thank you for it, As care disturbs me night or day; In fact no mortal doth abhor it Like Juan Paulâso go away, Go, in God's name. PATRICK. Nay, do not fear, Though slave, no fugitive am Iâ Oh! mighty Lord of earth and sky, What boundless joy my heart shall taste As, rapt in thought, I wander here, Amid the solitary waste; Enjoying, even on earth, a glance Of thy most glorious countenanceâ In solitude the sage and saint The wonders of thy bright world view.â PAUL. Pray will you tell me, if it ain't Offensive, who you're speaking to? PATRICK. Thou art of all created things, The reader cannot fail to be struck with the resemblance between this very beautiful passage of Calderon and the exquisite âSacred Songâ of Moore:â âThou art, O God, the life and light Of all this wondrous world we see.â The poet of the Melodies probably never read a line of Calderon, and was himself too rich in fancy to borrow even from him, if he had done so. The coincidence must be attributed to a certain affinity between the minds of the two poets, very perceptible here as elsewhere in the writings of both. O Lord, the essence and the causeâ The source and centre of all bliss; What are those veils of woven light, Where sun and moon and stars uniteâ The purple morn, the spangled nightâ But curtains which thy mercy draws Between the heavenly world and this? The terrors of the sea and landâ When all the elements conspire, The earth and water, storm and fireâ Are but the shadows of thy hand; Do they not all in countless waysâ The lightning's flashâthe howling stormâ The dread volcano's awful blazeâ Proclaim thy glory and thy praise? Beneath the sunny summer showers Thy love assumes a milder form, And writes its angel name in flowers; The wind that flies with winged feet Around the grassy gladdened earth, Seems but commissioned to repeat In echo's accentsâsilvery sweetâ That thou, O Lord, didst give it birth. There is a tongue in every flameâ There is a tongue in every waveâ To these the bounteous Godhead gave These organs but to praise his name! O mighty Lord of boundless space, Here canst thou be both sought and foundâ For here in everything around, Thy presence and thy power I trace. With faith my guide, and my defence, I burn to serve in love and fear; If as a slave, oh! leave me here; If not, O Lord, remove me hence! [An ANGEL descends, holding in one hand a shield, with a mirror in the centre, and in the other hand a letter. ANGEL. Patrick! PATRICK. Who calls? PAUL. There's no one byâ Nobody calls. The man's distraught [Aside. Methinks a poet he should be. ANGEL. Patrick. PATRICK. Who calls again? ANGEL. 'Tis I. PAUL. He speaks, and yet I can see noughtâ Well, let him speak: what's that to me? I am not placed to guard his tongue. [Exit. PATRICK. Ah! can I trust my wondering eyes, That Heaven so great a favour sends?â A glorious cloud from yonder skies With mingled tints of pearl and rose, And all its summer bravery hung, Before my raptured sight descendsâ And now its glittering gates disclose The sun within more glorious still; He comes in purple and in goldâ He comes, as comes the smiling dawn, In his crimson chariot drawn By the running rosy hoursâ Scattering over vale and hill Jessamine and all sweet flowers. Never yet by day or night Did I such a sight behold! ANGEL. Patrick! PATRICK. I'm dazzled with the light. Who art thou, celestial Lord? ANGEL. Patrick, of my own accord Here my course I have not bent, I am Victor, hither sent (Guardian Angel of thy soul), From the happy realms of bliss, Even by God, to give thee this. [Gives him the letter. PATRICK. Oh! sweet messenger divine, Happy harbinger of joy, How can I my heart control? Seeing thee, who, like the seven That before God's footstool shine, All thy eternal hours employ, 'Mid the sweet choirs singing, solely, âHoly! holy! holy! holy! Mighty Lord of Earth and Heaven.â ANGEL. Read the letter. PATRICK. Can it be That the scroll is sent to me? Yes to me 'tis sent indeed. [Reads the superscription, which is addressed: âTO PATRICK.â ANGEL. Open it. PATRICK. Within I read, âCome, Patrick, come, we wait for thee To free us from our slavery.â So ends the writing; it is clear This means more than doth appearâ Faithful guardian, let me know Who are those who call me so. ANGEL. Look within this mirror then. PATRICK. Heavens! ANGEL. What do you behold? PATRICK. A mighty crowd of young and old, Tender children, women, men, Calling me. ANGEL. And those you see Are the Irish people. They Stretch their longing arms to thee, Waiting for the blessed day, When the darkness past and gone, Thou wilt bring, like morning light, Tidings of the Faith:âBegone! Thou, I know, wilt not be loth To obey thy God's commandâ Leave thy slavery, and go Legate and Apostle both Of the favour'd Irish land. First to France depart and take There at blessed German's feet The habit of a monk. To Rome, Then, a rapid journey makeâ Then with letters from the Pope, Good Celestine, thou wilt come Hither, full of heavenly hope; Thou St. Martin, too, wilt see Bishop of Tours. But now with me Borne upon the mighty wind Let us leave this land behind, Now that I have let thee know What thy glorious fate must be, And the task reserved for thee, Let us on our journey go. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. âA ROOM IN THE PALACE OF EGERIO. Enter LUDOVICO and POLONIA. LUDOVICO. Polonia, whosoe'er has brought His heart to trifle with Love's chain, Has no reason to complain If another heart be thought Worthier of the bliss he soughtâ For it is his fitting fate; (Who has ever soared above, That fell not also?) Thus, my love Dareth to anticipate That of Philip, though his state Far exceeds what mine can be, He on Nature's bounty liveth, But in what exertion givethâ I am greater far than he: I, Polonia, by this hand Have obtained far higher merit Even than Philip doth inherit: If thou dost a proof demand, Look around this grateful land, Which hath almost frantic grown At the victories I have won: Round about the pleasant sun Now three rapid years have flown, Since upon these islands thrown, I thy happy slave became. Quicker than the thoughts that fly Has the fleeting time gone by. Need I call to mind, or name Those great trophies of my fame Won in many a fight by me, But to offer them to theeâ Which within this palace standâ Being the amazement of the land And the wonder of the sea? POLONIA. Ludovico, by thy valour, Whether by thine own worth merited, Or with Nature's gifts inherited, Thou hast stamp'd a glowâa pallor On my cheek, and thou hast lit Something blent of heat and coldnessâ Something blent of fear and boldness, In my breast: 'tis scarcely fit That I call it loveâfor it Doth awake my grief and shame, When I feel the Archer's aim Shoots the poison'd arrow through me, And the Deity subdue me In his wild resistless flame. But I make this one confession, Long thy hopes had been possession, Did I not so deeply fear My father's wrath; but persevere, And thou need'st not feel depression. Enter PHILIP. PHILIP. Here, perchance, my death I find. [Aside. Why then come distracted, blind, To seek it? But what man is he Who would have patience not to see The cause whereby his bosom pined? LUDOVICO. What dost thou pledge that thou'lt be mine? POLONIA. This hand. PHILIP. Not that my will is stronger, Which can endure this sight no longer, POLONIA. Ah, me! PHILIP. Wilt thou thy hand resign Unto a stranger? (How confine The grief I feel for such a crime!) And thou who in thy daring flight Dost seek the sun, that in his light You may obtain a death sublime, Why wilt thou not recall the time When thou my fetter'd slave wert seen? Why dost thou dare to cross my way? LUDOVICO. Because I dare to be to-day What now I am, not what I've been. 'Tis true I was your slaveâfor none Are safe from Fortune's fickle wheelâ But in my very heart I feel That in the fame that I have won, And in the deeds that I have done, (Why should I now the truth conceal?) My honour equals yours; indeed Some might surmise it doth exceed. PHILIP. Exceed me! vilest among men! LUDOVICO. Philip, in these words I've heard, You have err'd. PHILIP. I have not err'd. LUDOVICO. If you have not err'dâ PHILIP. What then? LUDOVICO. You have lied! PHILIP. Thou'rt vile again. [Strikes him. POLONIA. O Heavens! LUDOVICO. Why do I not take Instant vengeance? When my ire Burns within me, like the fire That from Etna's top doth break, Which not seas of blood can slake. [They draw their swords, KING EGERIO and Soldiers enter, and all place themselves on the side of PHILIP. KING. What is this? LUDOVICO. A lasting woeâ A misfortuneâan abuseâ A wild, angry fiend let loose From the infernal gulf below. Let no one presume to go Between me and revenge. Reflect, Fury heedeth nought beneath; Neither has it fear of death, Nor for any man respectâ My honour I must re-erect. KING. Seize him. LUDOVICO. Let the man who sighs For his death obey! you'll see What his valour gainsâfor he Shall be slain before your eyes; On this very spot he dies. KING. Quick pursue the daring slaveâ Who'd have thought of this? LUDOVICO. I lave In a blood-red stream each limb, On whose breast I seem to swim, Seeking Philip o'er the wave. [There is a clash of weapons, and they all go out but EGERIO, who remains alone. KING. This new blow alone was wanted; For a rumour has arisen, That the slave who fled from prison, He by whom my dreams are haunted, Has to Ireland, nothing daunted, Come from Rome, and hither guided, Has the world in bands divided, For the multitude enticed To believe the faith of Christ, Have along with Patrick sided. People say that he must be A magicianârumour saith That being sentenced unto death, By some other monarchs, he From their fetters set him free, And with such prodigious wonder Did he burst the cords asunder That confined him to the stake, That the earth began to quake From its darksome caverns under, Where the dead lie hid; the air Groan'd aloudâthe sun grew darkâ And the moon lay cold and stark, Missing the long golden hair Which the sun's bright brow doth wear. It is plain, from all one sees, Patrick holdeth Fortune's ball, For the people, one and all, Who beheld such prodigies, And with what miraculous ease He regained his liberty, Follow him from far and near In astonishment and fear. Here to-day approacheth he To try his magic spells on me. Let him come, before my rod Shall his magic spells be fleeing; We shall learn who is that being Whom they call the Christian's God. At my hands must Patrick die, If 'twere only but to try Whether he, by art or vigour, From the circle of my rigour Can with life escape and fly. We shall see what countless sums Of magic wealth he now can master, He this Bishopâhe this Pastorâ He who in the Pope's name comes. Enter the CAPTAIN and Soldiers, with LUDOVICO as a prisoner. CAPTAIN. Ludovico cometh taken, After leaving in their gore Three of thy guard, and wounding more. KING. Christian, is thy breast not shaken, Seeing my wrath at length awakenâ Seeing my hand upraised for blood? But vainly now, in frantic mood, Doth suffering tear my tenderest nervesâ This, and more, that man deserves Whoe'er has done a Christian good: Reward, not punishment, should be Your gift to-day; for it is plain, That I alone should feel the pain Of having done aught good to thee. Here, guard him close, till our decree Pronounce his death; my will is knownâ [To the soldiers. All hope of mercy now hath flownâ So you may spare your tears and sighsâ Not for his crimes, this Christian dies, But for his Christian creed alone. [They all go out but LUDOVICO, who remains alone. LUDOVICO. If for this I die, thou makest My unhappy death most happyâ Since he dieth for his Maker, He who dieth for His honour: And a man whom fortune doometh Here to live in pain and trouble, Ought to bless the falling death-stroke As the happy end of all things; Since its greatness comes to shorten Life's poor threadâso wildly tangled! Mine to-day becometh evilâ Like a phÅnix it arises From the ashes of dishonour. Here my life were deadly poisonâ Here my breath were serpent venomâ Till I could, throughout all Ireland, Shed vile blood in such abundance, As would wash away the insult And the memory of my wrong: Ah! honour, honour, low thou liest, Stricken by a rigorous hand!â I shall die with you. Together We shall conquer these barbariansâ For my death will, in a moment, Give us sweet and certain triumph. In this sharp and pointed dagger Lieth honourable vengeance!â But God bless me! what fell demon Prompts my hand? I am a Christianâ I have got an immortal soul, And the pious light of faith: Is it right that I, a Christian, Should commit, among these gentiles, Any act that would bring insult On the religion I profess? What example shall I give them By this dark crime of self-murder, But that my actions give the lie to All the virtuous works of Patrick? Since the people here, who only Worship their degrading vicesâ Who deny the soul's existence, And its future pain or gloryâ They would surely sayâwhat boots it Patrick's preaching that man's spirit Is immortal? What imports it? If the Christian Ludovico Kills himself: thereby proclaiming His own ignorance of its natureâ Thus would we with doubtful actions Keep the beams of faith from falling:â He the light, and I the darkness. Well, there is such evil in it That it must not be attempted: Not that I at all repent me Of the crimes that I've committedâ Nay, I rather sigh for new ones: Oh! if I could now but free me With my life, from out this prison, I would soon become the terror Of the world, in all its quarters, Europe, Africa, and Asia: I would make a dread beginning In these islands of Egerio; So that there would live no person Who would satisfy the anguish And the blood-thirst of my vengeance. Lightning when the sphere it cleaveth, Warns us with its voice of thunder; And, in mingled smoke and shadows, Imitating fiery serpents, Darteth through the trembling ether. Thus have I in thunder threatened, So that every man could hear it; But the fiery bolt is wanting; Ah! alas, it hath miscarried, And before it reach'd its object, Was the sport of every vapour; Death itself has got no terrors, No, not even a death so shameful; But what grieves me is to perish In my strong and early manhood, Ere my heart with crime is satedâ Life alone, for this I covet; That I yet may act far greater, Heaven doth know for nought beside. Enter POLONIA. POLONIA. Hesitation now is overâ [Aside. Ludovico, there are moments [Aloud. When love must no more be silent, But give proof how strong it is: Now your life is in great danger From the angry king, my father; And it doth behove your safety To escape his wrath and fury: By my liberal hand, the guardsmen Round your prison are suborned, And their watchful ears are deafened By the wondrous sound of gold; Fly: and that you may hereafter Know, how much a woman hazards, When she yields to love's delirium: How she tramples upon honourâ How upon respect she tramplethâ I with you will go: 'tis needful. Henceforth, for my whole existence, I must live or die beside you: Without you my life were nothingâ You who in my fond breast liveth. I bring gold and costly jewels More than we require, to place us In the farthest land of India; Where the sun burns up and freezesâ Now with beams, and now with shadows. At the door there stand two horses; I will call them swiftest panthersâ Daughters of the windâor rather, Thought itself would best describe them. They are safe as they are rapidâ For, although upon them flying Swifter than the sudden lightning, Scarcely shall we feel their motion. Oh! be resoluteâwhy dally? What delays you?âtime is pressingâ And that fortune which doth ever Interrupt love's course, at present May not mar a deed so noble! I shall show the way before you. With ingenious speech and action I shall gain the guard's attention, Giving you a chance of flyingâ See the sun our project favours, For he sinketh in the oceanâ There to rest him from his labours, And to cool his burning tresses. [Exit. LUDOVICO. To my very hands hath fortune Sent the chance I so much wished forâ For, Heaven knows, the proofs of liking Which I gave unto Polonia, Were but feignedâassumed, in order That I might thereby avail me Of the jewels which she carries, Soon or late, to fly with gladness From this Babylonian bondage; For although in her my person Lived esteemed, yet it was only Servitude disguisedâmy roving And unfettered life was pining For the pleasant breath of freedom, Which the heavens this day have granted. But for the future which I painted, A woman is a weight and hindrance; Love with me is but a fancy, Quickly gone as quickly born, Which when satisfied, the fairest Woman bringeth nought but tedium: Being soâof what importance Is another murder added To the many gone before it?â By my hands must die Polonia; She has chosen for her loving A most unpropitious epoch, When there's nothing loved or worshipped: Had she loved like other mortals, She would have lived as others live. [Exit. Enter the CAPTAIN. CAPTAIN. From the King I come with orders Here to read to Ludovico The fixed sentence of his death! But the prison door is open! And the tower is bare and empty! Something must have happenedâsoldiers! No one answers to my calling! Help! assistance! treason! treason! Enter the KING, PHILIP, and LAOGHAIRE. KING. Who is calling? Who's proclaiming? What is this? CAPTAIN. That Ludovico Has escaped; and with him also Have the guards departed. LAOGHAIRE. Monarch! Here I saw Polonia enter. PHILIP. Heavens! it is now too certain That 'twas she who gave him freedom; You must know he was her suitorâ Jealousy doth now incite me, And provoke me to pursue themâ From this very day, Hibernia Will be called a second Troy. [Exit. KING. Let me have a horse; in person I those fugitives must follow. Who are those two daring Christians, Who combine, with doubtful actions, One to shake my bosom's quiet, One to steal my dearest honour? But the two shall be the trophies Of my hand's far-reaching vengeanceâ From whose aim no man can hide him, Not even the mighty Roman Pontiff. [Exeunt. SCENE II. âA FOREST. POLONIA enters wounded and flying from LUDOVICO, who pursues her with a naked dagger in his hand. POLONIA. Oh! for Christ's sake, thy God, who reigns above, Restrain thy bloody handâif not for love; Take all I have, my gold, my honour take; But leave me my poor life, for pity's sake! LUDOVICO. Luckless Polonia, since creation's hour, Misfortune ever hath been beauty's dowerâ Where beauty dwelleth, happiness must fly, As moonbeams fade when sunshine lights the skyâ In me you see the most unpitying wretch That ever yet his murderous hands did stretch 'Gainst human lifeâand so this stroke I give, For you must die, that I may safely live; If you came with me, I would bear along, In you, the witness of my crime and wrong; By means of which I might, the whole earth round, Be tracked and followedâsought and surely found: If, with your life, I leave you here, 'tis plain I leave you wild with anger, rack'd with pain; And thus, I leave behind me, for my woe, One foe the more, and heavens! how great a foe! Alas! there seems no method to relieve youâ I would do wrong to take you, or to leave youâ And so it is much better, hapless woman! That I, with rage as cruel as inhuman, Heedless of God, or law, or pity, slay thee, And in the depths of this wild forest lay thee. Thus shall I hide my wretchedness from view, And gain a novel mode of vengeance too; If Philip lives within your heart, the blow That takes thy life will rid me of my foeâ And thus but one shall liveâyour sire to sate, Some future time, my vengeance and my hate: As first from thee the storm of insult burst, So must thou feel the strokes of vengeance first. POLONIA. Ah me! I've but contrived my own undoing, Like the poor worm, its fatal task pursuing, Weaving the silken coil of its own death! Art thou a Christian? Breath'st thou human breath? LUDOVICO. I am a demonâby this proof believe me. POLONIA. Oh! may the God of Patrick then receive me! [He stabs her, and she falls within. LUDOVICO. On a bank of flowers extended, Sad Polonia's woes are ended; Now I feel no weight detain me, Free I move, and nought shall chain meâ I bear with me all the treasures Life doth need, and all life's pleasures; With them I to Spain shall take me, There to live till time doth make me Somewhat changed in outward feature; Then as 'twere a new-born creature, Thither shall I come, with greater Hope to avenge me on a traitor. Till that hour my bosom weepeth (Injured honour never sleepeth!) But why now am I delaying, Here amidst death's shadows straying? 'Mid the gloom of daylight dying. I have lost my way; and flying From my pursuers, may be going Into their very hands. The glowing Of the unrisen moon is showing Where a peasant's hut is standing; Here it may be, by demanding, I may have my path-way righted. [He calls. PAUL and LUCY answer from within. LUCY. Who is there? LUDOVICO. A man benightedâ By the darkness overtakenâ Interrupts thy rest. LUCY. Awaken, Juan Paul, for some one's calling At the door. PAUL. He must be bawling For you; so answer him insteadâ For me, I'm well enough in bed. LUCY. Who is there? LUDOVICO. A traveller. PAUL. Eh, A traveller? LUDOVICO. Yes. PAUL. Travel on, I pray; This is not an inn. LUDOVICO. The clown Vexeth me. I must tear down This doorâit falls upon the ground. [He bursts in the door. LUCY. Ha! Juan Paul, will not the sound Awake you? They have burst the door. PAUL. Why, I am half-awake, no more; I have one eye open, but Still the other eye is shut; Well, come down with meâfor fear Somewhat troubleth me. Who's here? [They enter half-naked. LUDOVICO. Silence, peasant, or you die. Lost amid these hills have I Hither come: without delay You must put me on my way, How the nearest port to gain, Thence to fly across the main. PAUL. Oh! the road's as clear as light; Take this pathway to the right, When you pass a mountain-cleft, Turn a little to the left, Then you'll go along a plainâ To the right then turn again, Where a beaten path doth wind, And the port you can't but find. And of this be sure, in short, When you're there, that 'tis the port. LUDOVICO. Come and guide me hence; if not, You must die upon the spot. LUCY. It were better, cavalier, That till dawn you rested here. PAUL. Ah! you're very kind, my lady; [To LUCY. Have you fallen in love already? LUDOVICO. Peasant, quick, for time doth fly; Do you choose to guide or die? PAUL. Do not vex yourself. If I, Without question or reply, Rather choose to guide than die, I am ready now to go; Not through fear of deathâoh, no! But lest Lucy should rejoice. LUDOVICO. I must stop this babbler's voice. [Aside. Lest he tell where I have flownâ In the sea he must be thrown, When he puts me on my track. As for you, retire alone, [To LUCY. Soon your husband will be back. [LUDOVICO and PAUL go out at one side; LUCY at another. SCENE III. âANOTHER OPEN IN THE FOREST. Enter the KING, LESBIA, LAOGHAIRE, and the Captain. LESBIA. Not a trace can be discovered Whither they have fled. The mountain Has been search'd from top to bottom, And throughout the wood and valley, Every rock and leafy arbour Have been visited; but nothing Gives the slightest indication Whither they have gone. KING. 'Tis likely That the Earth the two has swallow'd, To preserve them from my furyâ For the Heavens could scarcely guard them From my anger and my vengeance. LESBIA. See the sun his golden tresses In the orient disentangling, Spreads them o'er the woods and mountainsâ Timely comes his light to aid us. Enter PHILIP. If your Majesty will hearken, You will learn a great afflictionâ More prodigious and more novel, Than e'er time or fortune fashion'd, Or imagination fancied: Seeking through these woods Polonia, I the whole night having wander'd Through their wild and dark recessesâ When the dawn began to glimmer, Clothed in ashen robes of mourning, And by thick black clouds surroundedâ When the pleasant stars were absent Not to see a sight so dreadfulâ Running hitherârunning thitherâ Soon I came where tender blossoms Were with crimson blood-spots sprinkled, And upon the earth were scatter'd Fragments of a woman's trinkets. By these mournful signs directed, Soon I came where I discover'd, 'Neath a grey rock, frowning over, In a fragrant tomb of roses, Dead and cold, Polonia lying! [The scene opens and discovers POLONIA lying dead beside a rock. Thither turn your eyes in anguishâ There the young tree lies extendedâ There the flower lies pale and wither'dâ There the bright flame is extinguishedâ There is Beauty's form laid prostrate, And its sinuous outline rigidâ There the dead Polonia lieth! KING. Ah! my heart is overwhelmed! I have not the power within me To endure such dire afflictionsâ Such innumerable sorrows, And such varying forms of anguish. Ah! my poor, unhappy daughterâ Ah! my darling wildly sought for! Evil is the hour I've found thee! LESBIA. I have been so stunn'd and startled, Breath is wanting for my wailing! O Polonia! let thy sister Share thy fate and thy misfortunes. KING. What wild hand could e'er have lifted Murderous steel against such beauty? Oh! my life doth set in sorrow, This disastrous day doth end it! PATRICK, within. PATRICK. Woe to thee! forlorn Hibernia! Woe to thee! unhappy people, If with tears you do not water, Day and night, the land in weeping: Opening thus the gate of Heaven, Which you closed by disobedience. Woe to thee! unhappy people; Woe to thee! forlorn Hibernia! KING. Heavens! what voice so sad and mournful Falls upon my ear? it pierceth Like an arrow through my bosom, To my heart's core penetrating. Learn who thus doth interrupt me In the moment of my sorrow. Who but I has need for wailing? Who but I has cause for sorrow? LAOGHAIRE. This, my gracious lord, is Patrick, Who since he has come to Ireland, Back from Rome, and since the Pontiff Unto him has given the title And pre-eminence of Bishop, Wanders thus about the island. PATRICK. Woe to thee! forlorn Hibernia! Woe to thee! unhappy people! Enter PATRICK. KING. Patrick, who my bitter anguish Interruptest, and my suffering Doublest, with your golden accents, Their deceitful poison hiding, Why thus persecute me? Wherefore Wander thus about my kingdom, Preaching novel modes of worship, And by frauds our peace disturbing? Here the scope of all our knowledge Is that we are born and perish; 'Tis the doctrine we inherit In the natural school our fathers Have bequeathed us. But, O Patrick! Who is this new God thou preachest, Who doth give us life eternal, When this mortal life is over? When the soul forsakes the body, How can it a new life enter, Whether of reward or suffering? PATRICK. By its being fully loosened From the body, which to nature Giveth back the human portion, Which is only dust and ashesâ And the spiritual essence, To the upper sphere arising, Finds the goal of all its laboursâ If in grace it haply dieth, Which is first conferred by baptismâ Ever after by repentance. KING. See this form of matchless beauty, In her own blood coldly lying, Is she living at this moment? PATRICK. Yes. KING. If so, the truth establish By some proof. PATRICK. O Lord of Heaven! Turn thine ear unto thy servantâ Here 'tis needful to exhibit Your almighty power and greatness. KING. You do not answer me. PATRICK. The Heavens Wish themselves to give you answer: In the name of God, I bid thee, Prostrate corse, thy soul resuming, Rise and liveâin this way giving Proof of all the words I've spoken; Preaching thus the Christian doctrine. [She arises. POLONIA. Alas! alas!âOh! Heaven preserve me! Oh! how many things are open'd To the soul!âOh! Lord Almighty, Stay the red hand of thy justice, Do not hurl against a woman All the rigour of thy anger, All the lightnings of thy power. Where, oh! where shall I conceal me If thy countenance be wrathful? Fall upon me, rocks and mountains! Mine own enemy, this moment I would think it joy to hide me From thy sight in earth's dark centre. But of what advantage were it, If to every place I fly to, I should bring with me the memory Of my crime and my affliction? See this mountain-range recedeth! See this hill hangs threat'ning over! See even Heaven itself doth tremble, Shaken on its poles. The tempest Throws its blackened shades around me. Now my trembling footsteps falterâ Now the waves recede before me, Everything but wild-beasts fly me, Which approach as if to seize me. Pityâmighty Lord! have pity! Mercy! mercy! Lord Almightyâ Humbly do I ask for baptism. And to die in grace and favour. Mortals! mortals! listen! listen! Christ is living! Christ is reigning! Christ is the true Godâthe only. Of your crimes repent! repent ye! [Exit. PHILIP. What a prodigy! CAPTAIN. A wonder! LESBIA. What a miracle! LAOGHAIRE. How glorious! KING. What enchantment! what bewitchment! Which of you this sight believeth? ALL. Christ is the true God Almighty! KING. Can you not perceive, blind people, How appearances deceive you? But to make this matter certain, I will own myself in error, If a little while disputing, Patrick doth convince my reason; To the argument then listenâ If man's spirit were immortal, It could never rest a moment From some active operation. PATRICK. Yes, and this is proved in slumber; For the shapes that dreams engender Are the workings of the spirit, Which doth never sleep; but even When half-loosened from the senses, Forms imperfect words and actions; This is why man often dreameth Things he waking never thought of. KING. This being soâPolonia lately Was alive or dead: if only In a swoon, you wrought no wonder; But on this I do not rest meâ But if dead, her soul had enter'd One or other of the placesâ Heaven or Hell, as you have taught us: If 'twere Heaven, it shocks God's mercy, That for any cause, a spirit Which had been allowed to enter Heaven, and taste his grace and favour, Should be sent back to the world: This appears to me quite certain.â If in hell, 'twould shock his justice, For it were not just that any Soul, which punishment did merit, Should obtain so great a favour As to have the chance of gaining Grace a second time: it follows, Either that your words were idle, Or that, in God's nature, justice Is another name for mercy: Where then was Polonia's spirit? PATRICK. Hear, Egerio, how I answer: I concede that Hell or Glory Must be the great goal and centre Of the soul baptized, whence no one Can depart: for so 'tis written In the laws of the Eternalâ Speaking of God's usual waysâ But if God so willed it, using His omnipotence, the pit-fall Of the deepest hell should yield up Any soul that he demanded: But this now is not the question. When a soul is doomed to enter One or other of the places, Well it knows its fate the moment That it leaves the mortal body, Never to return thereafter: But when it is doomed to visit, Once again, the earth, it wanders Like a traveller through creation, And, in this way hangs suspended In the universeâa portion Of itselfâwithout obtaining Any local habitation: For the Omnipotentâthe Highestâ Knowing all things by his prescience, Since the instant that his essence Drew the world and all its wonders Into lightâa glorious copy Of his own divine ideaâ Seeing that this thing would happen, That this soul would come back hither Held it for a time suspended, Without giving or denying It a final place to dwell in. So far, as a theologian, Have I answered your objection; But another truth remaineth To be told: there are more places In the other world, than those of Everlasting pain and glory: Learn, O King, that there's another, Which is Purgatory; whither Flies the soul that has departed In a state of grace; but bearing Still some stains of sins upon it: For with these no soul can enter God's pure kingdomâthere it dwelleth Till it purifies and burneth All the dross from out its nature, Then it flieth, pure and limpid, Into God's divinest presence. KING. So you say, but I have nothing, Save your own words, to convince me; Give me of the soul's existence Some strong proofâsome indicationâ Something tangible and certainâ Which my hands may feel and grasp at; And since you appear so powerful With your God, you can implore him, That to finish my conversion, He may show some real being, Not a mere ideal essence, Which all men can touch: remember, But one single hour remaineth For this task: this day you give us Certain proofs of pain or glory, Or you die: where we are standing Let your God display his wondersâ And since we, perhaps, may merit Neither punishment nor glory, Let the other place be shown us, Which you say is Purgatory; That we all may know and worship God's almighty power and greatness: Now His honour rests upon theeâ You can tell him to defend it! [They all go out but PATRICK. PATRICK. Here, mighty Lord, dart down thy searching glance, Arm'd with the dreadful lightnings of thine ire, Wing'd with thy vengeance as the bolt with fire, And rout the squadrons of fell ignorance: Come not in pity to the hostile band, Treat not as friends thy enemies abhorr'dâ But since they ask for portents, mighty Lord, Come with the blood-red lightnings in thy hand. Of old, Elias ask'd with burning sighs For chastisement, and Moses did display Wonders and portents: in the selfsame way Listen, O Lord, to my beseeching cries, And though I be not great or good as they, Still let my accents pierce the listening skies! Portents and chastisement, both day and night, I ask, O Lord, may from thy hand be given; That Purgatory, Hell, and Heaven May be revealed unto these mortals' sight. A good ANGEL descends on one side and a bad ANGEL on the other. BAD ANGEL. Fearful that the favouring skies May accede to Patrick's prayer, And discover to him where Earth's most wondrous treasure lies; Like a minister of light Hither have I dared to range, That I may disturb and change That same prayer with demon might. GOOD ANGEL. Back again, then, thou mayst soar, Cruel monster; to defend Patrick do I here attend: But be silent, speak no more:â Patrick, God has heard thy prayer, He has listen'd to thy vows; And as thou hast ask'd, allows Earth's great secrets to lie bare. Seek along this island ground For a vast and darksome cave, Which restrains the lake's dark wave, And supports the mountains round; He who dares to go therein, Having first contritely told All his faults, shall there behold Where the soul is purged from sin: He shall see with mortal eyes Hell itselfâwhere those who die In their sins for ever lie, In the fire that never dies. He shall see, in blest fruition, Where the happy spirits dwell. But of this be sure as wellâ He who without true contrition Enters there to idly try What the cave may be, doth go To his deathâhe'll suffer woe While the Lord doth reign on highâ Who this day shall set you free From this poor world's weariness; It is thus that God doth bless Those who love his name like thee. He shall grant to you, in pity, Bliss undream'd by mortal menâ Making thee a denizen Of his own celestial city. He shall to the world proclaim. His omnipotence and glory, By the wondrous Purgatory, Which shall bear thy sainted name. Lest thou think the promise vain Of this miracle divine, I shall take this shape malign, Which came hither to profane Your devotion and within This dark cavern's dread abyss Fling it; there to howl and hiss In the everlasting din. [The Angels disappear. PATRICK. May the Heavens proclaim thy praise! For thou lovest to impart, Mighty Lord! how great thou art, By thy wonder-working ways! Come, Egerio! [All enter. KING. Well! PATRICK. With me Come along this mountain's base, Thou shalt see the destined placeâ Thou and all who come with theeâ Where the severed souls remain; Some in bliss and some in painâ Of a never-ending sorrow, Of a night that knows no morrow, Thou a rapid glance shalt gain: Thou shalt see where angels dwell In a bright and happy sphere. In the wonders buried here Thou shalt see both Heaven and Hell! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. âA REMOTE PART OF THE MOUNTAIN: AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE STAGE A GLOOMY CAVERN. Enter the KING, PHILIP, LESBIA, LAOGHAIRE, the CAPTAIN, and a crowd of people, conducted by PATRICK. KING. Pause, O Patrick! thou art going To a dark and dismal spotâ Where the mid-day sun hath not Ever enter'd bright and glowingâ Where no living thing is growing, Shunn'd at once by man and brute. Cease then from thy vain endeavour, For that rugged path was never Trodden by a human foot! PHILIP. We for many a lengthen'd year, Who have lived here from our youth, Never dared to learn the truth Of the secrets hidden here: For the entrance did appear Terror-guarded, as to make Even the bravest bosom chill! None have ever cross'd this hill, Or this dark mysterious lake. KING. And the only sound we heard, Borne the troubled wind along, Was the sad funereal song Of some lone nocturnal bird. PHILIP. Do not persist to enter here. PATRICK. Let not fear disturb your breastsâ 'Tis a heavenly treasure rests In this cavern. KING. What is fear? Could the wild volcano wake Any feeling of the name? No; although the central flame Rush'd thereout, and lightnings brake From the Heaven's disjointed sphereâ Though the cover'd earth were brown With the smoke and fire rain'd down, Yet my soul were proof to fear. Enter POLONIA. POLONIA. Stay! unhappy people, stay! Daring, wild, and indiscreet, Pass not in with erring feetâ Ruin lieth in the way! From myself, with hurried footsteps, flying, I have sought this wilderness profound: Where the pure bright summer beam is dying In the shadow of this hill oak-crown'dâ That at length as in its dark grave lying, Never more could my offence be found; Here I seek a brief repose from strife, Shutting out the angry waves of lifeâ Not a guide had hostile fate decreed me, As I dared upon my path to stray, Vain the hand that would attempt to lead me, Through the tangled wildness of the way; From the terror yet I have not freed meâ From the admiration and dismay, Which were waken'd by this mountain's gloom, And the hidden wonders of its womb; See this rock (that it has not decended O'er the vale a miracle appears!) Still it hangs as it has hung suspended, Threat'ning ruin for unnumber'd years; In the mountain's cavern'd jaws extended Still it liethâchecks and interferes With the breath that from this cave escapes, Wherewith the melancholy mountain gapes: ?âBut I remember, Two miles on this side of the fort, the road Crosses a deep ravine; 'tis rough and narrow, And winds with short turns down the precipice; And in its depth there is a mighty rock Which has from unimaginable years, Sustained itself with terror and with toil Over the gulf, and with the agony With which it clings seems slowly coming down: Even as a wretched soul hour after hour Clings to the mass of life: yet, clinging, leans; And leaning, makes more dark the dread abyss In which it fears to fall; beneath this crag Huge as despair, as if in weariness, The melancholy mountain yawns.â âThe Cenci Shelley says, âAn idea in this speech was suggested by a most sublime passage in âEl Purgatorio de San Patricioâ of Calderon.â The same idea is to be found in âAmor despues de la Muerte,â and probably in some other dramas of Calderon. By these cypress-trees, in terror speeding Through the lips of sever'd rocks, I stray'd, There I saw a monstrous neck receding, Deep and dark and noisome in the shade, Though little life the sunless air was breeding, Some useless plants about the entrance play'd Of that vast spaceâthe horror and affright Of day, and dwelling of the frozen night: I enter'd there to try and make my dwelling Within the cave: but here my accents fail, My troubled voice, against my will rebelling, Doth interrupt so terrible a tale: What novel horror, all the past excelling, Must I relate to you, with cheeks all pale, Without cold terror on my bosom seizing, And even my voice, my breath, my action freezing? But scarce had I o'ercome my hesitation, And gone within the cavern's vaults profound, When I heard such shrieks of lamentation, Screams of grief that shook the walls aroundâ Curses, blasphemy, and desperation; Crimes avow'd that would even Hell astoundâ Which the Heavens, determined not to hear, Had placed within this prison dark and drear. Let him come who doubts what I am tellingâ Let him bravely enter who deniesâ Soon his ears shall hear the dreadful yelling, Soon the horrors gleam before his eyesâ But for me I feel my bosom swelling, And my tongue grow silent with surprise: I must ceaseâfor it is wrong, I feel, Heaven's most wondrous secrets to reveal. PATRICK. This cave, Egerio, which you see, concealeth Many mysteries of life and death, Not for him whose hardened bosom feeleth Nought of true repentance or true faith. But he who freely enters, who revealeth All his sins with penitential breath, Shall endure his purgatory then, And return forgiven back again. KING. Dost thou think, O Patrick, that my spirit Is so despicable, poor, and weak, That a woman's nature I inherit? But which of you shall enter? Philip, speak. PHILIP. My Lord, I dare not. KING. Captain, then the merit Is for thee. CAPTAIN. My Lord, some other seek. KING. Laoghaire, thou wilt not act like those? LAOGHAIRE. My gracious Lord, the Heavens interpose! KING. O cowards! lost to every sense of shame! Unfit to gird the warrior's sword around Your shrinking loinsâMen are ye but in name! Well, I myself shall be the first to sound The depths of this enchantment and proclaim Unto this Christian, that my heart unawed, Nor dreads his incantations, nor his God! [Here the mouth of the cave is discovered, the most horrible that can be imagined; within it is a pit, into which EGERIO rushes; he sinks in it with much noiseâ flames rise from below, and many voices are heard.] POLONIA. How terrible! LAOGHAIRE. How awful! PHILIP. What a wonder! CAPTAIN. The earth is breathing out its central fire. [Exit. LAOGHAIRE. The axes of the sky are burst asunder. [Exit. POLONIA. The Heavens are loos'ning their collected ire. [Exit. LESBIA. The earth doth shake, and peals the sullen thunder. [Exit. PATRICK. O Mighty Lord, who will not now admire Thy wondrous works? [Exit. PHILIP. Who that is not insane Will enter Patrick's Purgatory again? [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âA STREET. Enter JUAN PAUL, fantastically dressed as a soldier, and LUDOVICO very pensive. PAUL. Some day I knew 'twould happen so, And that the day has come is plain, When I should ask you to explain What I so much desire to know: You will remember, in the dark, How, from my cabin I did start, To point you out the nearest part Where you, with safety, might embark. Another time, pray recollect, You said, Or come with me, or dieâ Of two such evils how that I The greater evil did select, Which was to follow in your trainâ How, as a shadow, at thy side, With thee I've wander'd far and wide, Throughout fair Italy, and Spain, France, Scotland, England, all have been Explored by us, and we, in fact, Have left no strange and distant tract Unvisited. At length we're seen, Thus having pass'd o'er land and sea, Upon the Irish coast again: I, Juan Paul, with 'wilder'd brain, Confused, amazed at what I seeâ Your hair, and beard of monstrous sizeâ Your counterfeited voiceâyour dress So changedâimplore you to confess Why thou dost wear such strange disguise?â By day you never leave the inn, But in the frosty, midnight air A thousand wild exploits you dare, Without remembering we are in A land where everything has changedâ Where nothing can be heard or seen As we remember they had been, When formerly this land we ranged: Egerio the King is dead, Killed by despair's unceasing pains, And Lesbia, his daughter, reigns, Queen of this kingdom in his stead, Because Poloniaâ LUDOVICO. Oh! proceed, But name me not Polonia's name; Do not destroy my trembling frame, Nor terrify me with a deed For which so many tears I shed!â I know at length Polonia died. PAUL. Our host, with whom we here abide, Told me, as how they found her dead, Andâ LUDOVICO. Cease, I do not wish that thou The manner of her death should stateâ Enough for me to mourn her fate. PAUL. He also said, the people now Are all good Christians here; they know The sinful state from which they fled, Because, one Patrick, who is deadâ LUDOVICO. Is Patrick dead? PAUL. Our host says so. LUDOVICO. Badly have I fulfill'd my vowâ [Aside. Proceed: PAUL. The faith of Christ did preach, And, as a proof that he did teach The truth about the soul, and how It seeks in death some other clime, A wondrous cave discover'd here, And what a cave! He shakes with fear Who hears it named! LUDOVICO. Another time I heard the same miraculous tale, Which made my hair in terror stand. They say the dwellers in this land See sights that make the boldest quail. PAUL. Since thou, in melancholy mood, In mingled terror and affright, Nor use thy tongue, nor use thy sight, But hide as if by foes pursued: Since this is so, SeÃ±or, 'tis clear You have not come to hear or see These things, how wondrous they may be. Say then, at once, what brings us here?â Nor think my doubts impertinent. LUDOVICO. I'll answer allâfrom out your cot I took youâin some lonely spot To slay you was my first intentâ But then it better did appear To take you where my steps might wend, As my companion and my friendâ Throwing aside the dreadful fear That made me shun the sight of man, In fine, that you being with me, Paul, I might find solace, after all; Through many various lands we ran, Nor didst thou, as we roam'd along, Feel need of aught. But now I'll say Why we are hereâit is to slay A man who did me grievous wrong: It is on this account I go, Concealing country, dress, and name, It is at this I ever aim Throughout the night, because my foe Is the most powerful person here! And that I may to you confide Why you to-day are at my side: Listen, the cause shall soon appearâ Three days have pass'd away since I Came to this city in disguise, And twice beneath the midnight skies, Here have I sought my enemy, In his own street, at his own door, Each time a figure pass'd me by, Disguised, and so contrived that I Had to postpone the death I swore. He call'd me in the lonely street, And when I sought to reach him near, To me he seem'd to disappear, As if the wind were in his feetâ To-night I thought it best that you Should come along with me, that so The figure we might surely knowâ Caught as it were between us two. PAUL. Who are the two? LUDOVICO. Why, you and I. PAUL. I am not one. LUDOVICO. Not one? PAUL. Oh! no, SeÃ±or, whenever you will go On such exploits as now you try, I am not one, nor half a oneâ With my Lord Shadow's fearful stories, Or with my Lady Purgatory's, I am determined to have done: In all my life, by day or night, The other world's strange affairs Were never known among my cares; Methinks in this I acted rightâ But place me 'gainst a thousand men, And if I quickly do not run From the whole thousandânay, from one, Call me the maddest mortal then. For who would rather choose to die, Who for a little race at mostâ A thing of such a trifling costâ Could his own life and safety buy? My life I value very highâ Here leave me till you've done, and then, SeÃ±or, come back for me again. LUDOVICO. This is the house: Philip must die To-night beneath my vengeful handâ We soon shall see if Heaven defends His life, or only but pretendsâ Here in this place you best can stand. Enter a FIGURE MUFFLED in a cloak. PAUL. That I doubt;âbut some one cometh. LUDOVICO. Fortune doth this night befriend me, Since it gives me the occasion Now to take a double vengeance: Nothing shall disturb my fury, Nothing shall prevent my slaying, First, this strange, mysterious figure; Philip's death shall follow after. 'Tis the person that I spoke of, By his gait and dress I know him: But what terror makes me tremble To behold him? FIGURE. Ludovico! LUDOVICO. Cavalier, two nights already Have I met you here: inform me, If you call me, why thus fly me; If you seek me, why depart thus? FIGURE. Follow me, you then shall know me! LUDOVICO. Pardon me, I have some business In this street that makes it needful Here to be without a witness; And in killing you, I'll fancy That I kill another person: Draw or not your sword, this moment I shall take a double vengeance: [Draws his sword and strikes at the Figure, but only cuts the air.] Heavens! 'tis but the air I strike at! Intercept him, Paul, beside thee. PAUL. I don't practise intercepting. LUDOVICO. Through the city I shall track thee, Up and down, till I discover Who and what you are. Ah! vainly [Aside. Does my sword flash out its lightnings To destroy himâthey are powerless, Either to offend or touch him. [They go out, Enio striking at the Figure without touching it.] Enter PHILIP. PAUL. God be with them! One has vanished [Aside. From the street, and now another Comes to me. I am bewilder'dâ Like St. Antony, I'm tempted, Both by figures and by phantoms: I must hide me in this doorway, Till the other passes by me. PHILIP. Loveâaspiring, wild, and daringâ With the favours of a kingdomâ Makes me now a happy lover, For Polonia, in the desert Living among trees and brambles, Citizen of lonely mountainsâ Islander of lake-bound islets, Has resigned unto her sister Lesbia, the throne and kingdom. I, through interest more than love, Pay unceasing court to Lesbia, Worshipping her rank and station: Now I come from hopeful converse With her at her grated window: But what's this?âeach night a stranger Here I meet upon my threshold! PAUL. Ah! this way it is approachingâ Why to me comes every phantom? PHILIP. Cavalier! PAUL. I do not answer To that name: he is addressing Some one else. PHILIP. This is my dwelling. PAUL. Well, thank God! I'm not your tenant: For a thousand years enjoy it, Without courtiers for your lodgers. PHILIP. If you here are forced to tarry, It concerns me not. Allow me Room to pass you in the entrance. PAUL. What a civil-spoken phantom! [Aside. Ah! these ghosts are arrant cowards! Whether here, Sir, I have business, Or have not, it makes no matter; Here to enter you are welcomeâ I would be the last to hinder Any gentleman from going Home to bed. PHILIP. You much oblige me! Truly very valiant shadows [Aside. Haunt this street; 'tis somewhat curious That for several nights a stranger Here I've met, who, when I seek him, Fades among the darksome doorways: But this matter naught concerns me. [Exit. [PAUL draws his sword and affects to follow PHILIP. PAUL. Now he's gone, I may be valiant. Good Mr. Shadow, stop, I pray thee, Or, if not Mr.âMiss, or Madam: Ah! I cannot overtake himâ Heavens! 'tis but the air I strike at!â Well if this the cavalier is Whom we have so long expected, He is a most lucky fellow To have got to bed so safely: But another sound approachesâ Sword-strokes mix'd with angry voices; Here they comeâbut thus I leave them. [Exit. Enter the CLOAKED FIGURE and LUDOVICO. LUDOVICO. Cavalier! we have departed From the street: if there was in it Aught to interrupt our combat: Here, at length, we two are standing Face to face, to end the quarrelâ Since my sword cannot offend you, I must learn, upon you rushing, Who and what you are. Acknowledge Are you phantom, man, or demon? Are you silent? then 'tis needful That your dark disguise I open, And discoverâ [He tears open the cloak and discovers a skeleton. Heaven defend me! What is this? Oh! Lord Almighty! What a spectacle of terror!â Horrid vision! Grisly phantom! Stiff and fleshless corse, who are youâ Ashes feigning life and motion? FIGURE. Mortal, know you not yourself? Here you see your truest pictureâ I am Ludovico Enio! [Disappears. LUDOVICO. Aid me, Heaven! what dismal tidings! Aid me, Heaven! what fearful vision! Shadows, sorrows crowd around me, And my wretched life is over! [He falls on the ground. Enter PAUL. PAUL. 'Tis my master's voice that callethâ See, my lord, that succour cometh Now in me: LUDOVICO. Oh! horrid monster! Why return again? Thy accents Overwhelm my soul! PAUL. He's franticâ I am not a horrid monster, But poor Juan Paulâthat ninnyâ Who too faithfully attends thee, Without knowing why or wherefore. LUDOVICO. Paul, excuse me, that my terror Made me first not recognise thee, That indeed is little wonder When my very self I know not. Did you see, as here you enter'd, A dread shapeâa grisly spectre?â One by fleshless bones supportedâ One with fingers cold and rigidâ One with eyeless sockets staringâ Where is he? PAUL. Indeed, I know not: Had I seen him, on the instant, I, more dead than he, had fallen. LUDOVICO. And so would every human being: Thus I fell, with stifled accents, All my senses scared or frozenâ All my limbs with cold lead fetter'dâ While, above me, seem'd descending Of two poles, the wondrous structure, By my strength alone supported; And from everything around me There did start some hidden terror: Mighty rocks from gentle flowersâ Giants from the midst of roses: For the earth from out its centre, Flung its grisly host of shadows, And I saw myself among them! From that sight, in pity, hide me, Gracious Heaven! O Earth, conceal me In your darkest, central caverns, That I ne'er again may see me! Or, if that sad sight be needful, Let me see myself the monster That I wasâthe daring rebel, Proud, insane, and disobedient, Who God's law so violatedâ He, for whom, if God would punish Crimes as they deserve, the torments Even of Hell were insufficientâ Which he must endure for ever, While God reigns or hell existeth;â But this truth I treasure also, That these crimes have been committed 'Gainst a God so full of mercy, That I yet can gain their pardon, If, with bitter tears, I weep them: Such repentance now doth seize me; And that I, even from this moment, May become a new-born creature, In His saving hands I place me: Not according to thy justice, Judge me, O eternal Father! But according to thy mercy; For thy attributes are blended Both of mercy and of justice: Deign to let me know some method Of repentance, of atonement: What will be a satisfaction For my life?â [Music within. VOICES. The Purgatory! LUDOVICO. Heavens! what sonorous accents Breathe around! A revelation Do they seem, for Heaven assisteth The repentant, humbled sinner, In its own mysterious manner: And since comes the inspiration From on high, I wish to enter Into Patrick's Purgatory: Humbly and devoutly keeping Thus the promise that I gave him, If indeed it be my fortuneâ There to meet with holy Patrick: If the trial have its dangers,â Since all human strength is powerless Either to resist its terrors, Or to bear the awful torments Which the vengeful demons fashionâ Still I should remember likewise That my crimes were just as dreadful, And that in the same proportion I must sufferâas physicians, Curing desperate diseases, Act on desperate prescriptions.â Paul, come with me, you shall see me At the bishop's feet laid prostrate With repentance and with terror; All my dreadful sins confessing. PAUL. No, Sirâyou must take this journey By yourselfâa man so valiant Surely needeth no companionâ And it seems an innovation That a gentleman should go to Hell attended by his valet: To my village I shall saunter, Where I'll live without vexation,â If I need must have hobgoblins, Lucy will be quite sufficient. [Exit. LUDOVICO. As my many crimes were public, So shall be my deep repentanceâ Like a man possess'd I'll wander Through the world, my sins proclaiming: Men, wild beasts, deserted mountains, Starry globes, dim wildernesses, Tender plants, dry sapless elm-trees, I am Ludovico Enio! At my name with horror tremble! I, who lately was the proudest, Now confess myself the humblest; I have faith and firm reliance That you yet shall see me happy, If in God's name blessed Patrick Aid me in the Purgatory. [Exit. The interview between Ludovico, Enio, and the Skeleton, at p.229, says a recent writer, âis a scene truly Calderonic âthe hour, the place, the intended assassin, and the sudden reflection of himself, with his guilty conscience impersonate before him; it reminds us of that wild fable of Jeremy Taylor or Fuller, about the bird with a human face, that feeds on human flesh until it chances to see its own reflection in a stream, and then it pines away for grief that it has killed its fellow.â âWestminster Review, vol. liv. p. 306. SCENE II. âA WILD MOUNTAIN DISTRICT; A LAKE IN THE DISTANCE. POLONIA appears upon the slope of a mountain; she descends slowly to the stage. POLONIA. To Thee, O Lord! my spirit climbs, To Thee from every lonely hill I burn to sacrifice my will A thousand and a thousand times. And such my boundless love to Thee, I wish each will of mine a living soul could be. Would that my love I could have shown By bearing for thy sake, instead Of that poor crown that press'd my head, Some proud, imperial, golden crownâ Some empire, which the sun surveys Through all its daily course and gilds with constant rays. This humble home, 'neath rocks uphurl'd, In which I dwell, though poor and small, Compared to this great mountain-wall, Is the eighth wonder of the worldâ The smallest cave that in it lies Exceeds the halls of kings in majesty and size. Far better on some natural lawn, To see the morn its gems bestrew, Or watch it weeping pearls of dew Within the white arms of the dawn; Or view, before the sun, the stars Drive o'er the brighten'd plain their swiftly fading cars. Far better to behold, when free, Through Heaven, the shades of evening playâ The shining chariot of the day Go down amid the western seaâ Better in darkness and in light, My voice should speak thy praise, O Lord, by day and night! Than to endure the inner strifeâ The specious glare, but real weight Of pomp, and power, and pride, and state, And all the vanities of life: How would we shudder could we deem That life itself, in truth, is but a fleeting dream! Enter LUDOVICO. LUDOVICO. True to my purpose, on I go, [Aside. With footsteps strong, and bosom brave, Looking for that mysterious cave Where the pitying Heavens will show How my salvation I may gain By bearing in this life the Purgatorial pain: [To POLONIA. Divinest woman! if you be A dweller in this lonely ground, Or in the neighbouring hills around, The shortest way point out to me, That leads unto the wondrous cave, Where penitential man his living soul may save. POLONIA. Fortunate traveller, to whom This boon was granted at thy birth, To seek that treasure which the earth Conceals within its richest wombâ Well can I guide thee on thy way, For this, and this alone, amid these wilds I stay. This mountain, do you see? LUDOVICO. I see [Aside. My death in it. POLONIA. Oh! woe and fear! [Aside. My soul! what man is this that's here? LUDOVICO. I cannot think that it is she? [Aside. POLONIA. Can it be he whom now I scan? [Aside. LUDOVICO. It is that hapless maid! [Aside. POLONIA. It is that wretched man! [Aside. LUDOVICO. It may be only an illusion, Sent to dazzle and mislead, My intent to changeâProceed: [To POLONIA. POLONIA. Can it be for my confusion, [Aside. Man's dread enemy doth send This spectre in my path? LUDOVICO. You do not speak. POLONIA. Attend: This monstrous hill, with rocks bestrown, Full well the dreaded secret knows, But no one to its centre goes By walking o'er the land alone. He who would see this wondrous cave Must in a bark put forth and tempt the lake's dark wave: Revenge doth seek to burst its chain, [Aside. But pity doth its rage subdue. LUDOVICO. My days their darksome hours renew, [Aside. Since I behold her once again. POLONIA. What feelings in my bosom blend! [Aside. LUDOVICO. I feel as I were dead!âYou do not speak. POLONIA. Attend!â This darksome lake doth all surround Yon hill that cleaves the heavens' deep blueâ A cross whose level wave, by you, An easy pathway may be found; And in the middle of the isle A convent's sacred walls beneath the sunlight smile; Some holy monks inhabit there, And for this task alone they live, With pious zeal to freely give The helping hand, the strengthening prayerâ Confession, and the Sacred Mass, And ev'ry pious aid to all who thither pass, Telling them what they first must do Before they dare presume to go, Alive, within the realm of woeâ Let not this enemy subdue [Aside. My soul, O Lord! LUDOVICO. My hopes are fair, [Aside. Let me not feel, O Lord! the anguish of despair! Seeing before my startled sight My greatest, deepest crime arise: Let not the fiend, my soul, that tries, Subdue me in this dreadful fight. POLONIA. What greater foe could vengeance lend [Aside. Than he who standeth here? LUDOVICO. You do not speak: POLONIA. Attend: LUDOVICO. With quicker words your story tell, For well I know my soul doth need That I should go with swifter speed! POLONIA. And me it doth import as well That you should go away. LUDOVICO. Agreed! Now, woman, point the way to where my path doth lead. POLONIA. No one accompanied can pass Across the bosom of this lake. But each a little bark must take And try alone the rippling glass, Being in that most trying strait, The lord of his own deedsâthe master of his fate. Come, where within a secret cave, Beside the shore the boat doth lie, And trusting in the Lord on high, Embark upon the crystal wave Of this remote and lonely sea. LUDOVICO. My life and all I have, O bark! I trust to thee, And thus confide me to thy care: But, O my soul! I shake with fear, For it a coffin doth appear, In which, presumptuously I dare To try this dark and icy tide! [He enters within. POLONIA. Do not return, proceed, and in the Lord confide! LUDOVICO, within. Victory! victory is mine, Polonia, for before thy sight My spirit has not quailed. POLONIA. To flight Have I too made my wrath resign Here in this Babylonian realm. LUDOVICO. The seeming shape you wear doth not my soul o'erwhelm, Although you take a well-known form To turn me from my path astray, And make me falter on my way. POLONIA. Badly thy fear doth thee inform, Poor trembler!âonly rich in fear; For I, Polonia's self, alone am standing here: The same your murderous dagger slew, Who by the Heavens' mysterious grace Live in this wild and desert place, And feel more peace than e'er I knew. LUDOVICO. Since I confess, with sorrowing heart, The many sinful scenes in which I've play'd my part, Do thou pronounce my pardon too. POLONIA. You have my pardon and my prayers. LUDOVICO. Naught from my breast my firm faith scares. POLONIA. Ever confide in it. LUDOVICO. Adieu! POLONIA. Adieu! LUDOVICO. May God his wrath restrain! POLONIA. And may he bring you back victorious once again! [Exit. SCENE III. âTHE ISLAND. Enter two CANONS REGULAR. FIRST CANON. There's not the faintest zephyr blowing, And yet the lake's calm waves are rippled, Doubtless, o'er its bosom, pilgrims To the island are approaching. SECOND CANON. Let us, to the shore descending, Learn who are the daring mortals Who are bold enough to visit Our obscure and distant dwelling. Enter LUDOVICO. LUDOVICO. To the waves I have confided My strange bark, or rather coffin: Who, through fire and snow, e'er ventured In his sepulchre till now? What a pleasant prospect opens! Here methinks the spring has summon'd To her gay and varied Cortes The noble and plebeian flower: There a dismal mountain riseth, And the two so greatly differ, That their very opposition Binds them in a closer bond: There are mournful night-birds wailing, With their screams awak'ning terror; Here are joyful song-birds warbling Notes that fill the heart with joy: There the angry torrent rusheth Headlong down the frowning mountain; Here the gentle streamlet glideth, Giving mirrors to the sun: Half-way 'twixt these different regions, One so fair and one so frowning, Riseth up a stately building, Which awakes my love and fear! FIRST CANON. Happy traveller, who hither Has to-day thy courage brought thee, To my arms approach. LUDOVICO. 'Twere better That before thy feet I kneel, But conduct me now in pity To the grave and reverend prior, Who this sacred convent rules. FIRST CANON. I am he, although unworthy; Speak, proceed, what interrupts thee? LUDOVICO. Father, if my name I mention, Much I fear that you will fly me, Fright'ned at the sound; for truly All my actions are so wicked, That the shining air around us, Not to see them, would be cover'd With a cloudy veil of mourning. I am an abyss of horror, And a stormy sea of fury; I am a map of misbehaviour, And the world's most awful sinnerâ In a word, lest breath should fail me, I am Ludovico Enio: I have come the cave to enter, Where, if any satisfaction Can be made for crimes so deadly, My repentance there shall make it. I have been absolvedâconfessing To the Bishop of Hibernia All my sins; who being acquainted With my wish and my intention Here to come, with love and council Strengthen'd my weak resolution, And for thee these letters gave me. [Gives them. FIRST CANON. Ludovico, do not venture On so great an undertaking In one day, it is a subject That requires deliberationâ Stay with us our guest a short time, And reflect more calmly on it. LUDOVICO. Oh! my father, I shall never Rise from where I now am kneeling Till you grant me this great favourâ It was God's own inspiration, That did drive me longing hither, And not vanity, ambition, Nor desire to know the secrets Hidden here: do not, I pray thee, Interrupt my good intention, For it is a true vocation; Oh! my father, yield in pity, Grant this favour to my suff'ring. Grant my grief this consolation, Grant this soothing to my sorrow. FIRST CANON. Little think'st thou, Ludovico, What is the great boon thou'rt asking, For it is through Hell's dread torment That you seek to pass: your valour Will not bear you through the ordeal! Many are there, Ludovico, Enter here, but few return. LUDOVICO. Fear doth not at all affright me, For once more I do protest me, That my only wish or object Is to purge my crimesâwhose number Far exceeds the sands of ocean, Or the atoms of the sunbeam: I have hope and firm reliance In the Lord, whose name shall conquer All the powers of Hell. FIRST CANON. The fervour Of the words you speak compel me Now the awful doors to open: This is the cavern, Ludovico! [Opens the mouth of the cave. LUDOVICO. Heaven preserve me? FIRST CANON. Art thou frightened? LUDOVICO. No; and yet it makes me tremble. FIRST CANON. Once again, I now implore you For no other cause to enter Here, except to ask for pardon For your sins. LODOVICO. I now am standing, Father, in the cave's dark entrance; Listen to my protestationâ Men and beasts, and skies and mountains, Day and night, and ye bright planets, Sun and moonâall, all things listen To my thousand protestations: 'Tis alone to suffer torments For the sins that I've committed That I enter here; my penance Can be little satisfaction For my crimes; but something tells me I shall find my soul's salvation. FIRST CANON. Enter then; and ever with thee In thy mouth and in thy bosom Bear the sacred name of Jesus! LUDOVICO. Lord! Oh Lord! be ever with me, In thy faith, as in strong armour, In the open field I struggle With my enemy, victorious From the fight may thy name draw me! Many times the sacred symbol Of my faith upon my forehead Shall I make. Oh Heaven preserve me! [Here he goes into the cave, the entrance of which closes after him. FIRST CANON. In all the persons who have entered Here, I never saw such courage: Grant him, gracious Lord, thy favour, That he may resist the demons And their strong temptations, trusting To thy name and presence only. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. âTHE ISLAND. Enter LESBIA, PHILIP, LAOGHAIRE, the CAPTAIN, and POLONIA. LESBIA. While along the road we stray, Following where you guide us, let us say Why we have come hither now; It was to see you, and to you avow All the plans that we have made. POLONIA. Say on, to speak your mind be not afraid, While my footsteps you pursue, Because a sight I bring you now to view Such as mortal eyes ne'er saw. LESBIA. Thus from before my thoughts the veil I draw; You, Polonia, hither came To feed, among these wilds, religion's flame, Leaving me the splendid care Of a crown: 'tis right I share With you the secrets of my heart, And so the whole I will to thee impart: My will, being sacrificed, demands Not advice, my sister, but commands: Woman needs a stronger head Than is her own, for councilâshe must wed. POLONIA. Yes: and much I shall rejoice If for a bridegroom Philip is your choice, For a double joy 'twill be To give a husband and a crown to theeâ That my love may be the source Whence all your blessings flow. LESBIA. For many a course Of the sunâwhich lives and dies Daily and nightly 'mid the changing skiesâ That glorious PhÅnix which doth give New life in its refulgenceâmay'st thou live! POLONIA. Now that you have said so much On what concerns your marriage, let us touch On the matter that doth send You hither after me, and so attend:â In a penitential glow, A man came hither whom we all do know, Seeking out for Patrick's cave, To enter there, and so his soul to save: He did enter, and to-day Again comes forth: to show you that dismay That wonder cannot greater be, Here I have brought you all this miracle to see: What is his name I have not said, Lest you, perchance, disturbed by inward dread, Should not see the end I sought, And so along with me I have ye brought. LESBIA. Oh! my sister, it is right That I should mingle terror with delight! PHILIP. All of us who hither go, Desire the truth of all these things to know. POLONIA. If, through want of courage, he Is doomed for ever in the cave to be, We, at least, shall know his fate; But if he comes forth from the cave elate, Then from him, at length, we'll hear What these strange things may be: I only fear That, through awe, he may not speak, And, flying from us, he, perchance, may seek Some wild solitude alone. LESBIA. In wondrous ways the power of God is shown! CAPTAIN. At the proper time we're here, For see, the monks in lengthened file appear: Shedding tears!âwith footsteps slowâ On to the cave in silent thought they go, That they may the entrance ope. Enter, in the habit of CANONS, a number of Religious; they reach the cave, from which LUDOVICO issues like one amazed. FIRST CANON. O Lord of Heaven! in whom is all our hope Some day to behold thy realm, Let not this dungeon cave this soul overwhelm: Let him back his footsteps trace From out the pit that knows not of thy face! POLONIA. See! FIRST CANON. What joy to us is given! PHILIP. It is Ludovico! LUDOVICO. Aid me, Heaven! Is it possible that I, After so many years behold the sky? And enjoy its golden light? CAPTAIN. How confused! LAOGHAIRE. How blinded with affright! FIRST CANON. Embrace me, thou hast acted well! LUDOVICO. My arms were chains, my bosom were a cell: Since, Polonia, thou art here, I, to obtain my pardon, do not fear: Philip ever bless the Lord, For twice an angel saved thee from my sword, As I watched for thee by nightâ Pardon I ask of all: and now in flight I shall seek some desert place, Where, unseen by any human face, I, in pain, some hope may glean: He who could see the things that I have seen Would to live in suffering seek. FIRST CANON. In the name of God, I bid thee speak, Enio, of the things you've seen. LUDOVICO. To so sacred a command I lean Submissive, and that earth may be Startled from its fearful apathy; And that man may now begin To rise from out the darksome death of sin, Waken'd by the tidings that I send, To the grave story of this cave attend:â After solemn preparation, Which so great a venture needed, And of all a tender farewell Having taken, I departed, Firm in faith and strong in valour, This most wondrous cave to enter, Placing in my God reliance, And a thousand times repeating Those mysterious words that even Hell itself doth hear with trembling, Slowly entering by the threshold, There a little while I waited For the closing of the portal: When it closed at length I found me In such thick and pitchy darknessâ In a night so black and mournfulâ That I closed my eyes, and, blinded In this way, proceeded onward Till I reached, with hands outstretchÃ©d, A vast wall that rose before me: Following the dark wall's windings For about some twenty paces, I approached some rocks, where gleaming Through a chink, a light so dubious Enter'd that 'twas scarcely light; As when we behold the coming Of the dawn amid the orient, We are doubtful if the twilight Be the light of morn or not; Still along the left hand keeping, Soon I entered on a pathway, Where the earth began to tremble Underneath my frightened footsteps, As if it would sink in ruin; Almost lifeless there I tarried, Till a dreadful clap of thunder, With its horrid clangour, woke me From my trance, and my oblivion; And the earth, where I was standing, Opening its centre, hurled me Headlong down the dark abysses, Where the stones and earth that followed Made a sepulchre around me: In a spacious hall of jasper Then I found me, where the chisel Round about had left its traces In the wondrous architecture. From a door of bronze there issued Twelve grave men, in snow-white garments, Who, respectfully approaching, Gave me courteous salutation; One of them, who seemed superior To the others, said: âRemember That you place your faith in God; Be not frightened at beholding Demon bands your course opposing, For if you should be so wretched As to wish to turn back, wrought on By their promises or threat'ningsâ You in Hell must ever tarry, Suff'ring everlasting torments:â These twelve men were blessÃ©d angels, Who thus raised my drooping spirits, And renewed my sinking courage. Soon the spacious hall was peopled With a host of demon shadowsâ Hellish visionsârebel spiritsâ Bearing shapes so dark and hideous, That the earth has not a monster That these demons doth resemble; And one said: âO foolish mortal, Madman, idiot, thou who seekest Ere thy time the pain that waits thee, And the woe that thou dost merit: If thy crimes are great, 'tis proper That thy own heart doth condemn thee, For thou need'st not hope for mercy In the eye of God for ever: For what reason comest thou hither? Back again to earth returning, Let your whole life there be finished, Dying as you have been living: Then indeed you may come see us, And ascend the seat predestined For thee in this darksome region, Which must be thy place for ever.â Giving to these words no answer, Then with blows they fell upon me, Bound my hands and feet together, Pierced me with sharp hooks of metal, And along the chambers drew me, Till they reached a raging bonfire, In the midst of which they threw me; All I said was: Jesus! aid me! When the hideous demons vanished, And the flames were all extinguished! After this I was conducted To a field, whose blackened surface Only bore wild thorns and brambles In the place of pinks and roses; Here the cold wind penetrated With its subtle breath each member Deeper than the sharpest weapon: Here, in darksome caverns under, Were the souls of many guarded, And such mournful wailings issuedâ Such dread criesâsuch imprecations Heaped on parents and relationsâ Such forlorn, despairing voicesâ Such wild blasphemies and curses, O'er and o'er again repeatedâ That the very demons trembled: Passing onward, then I found me In a meadow which was cover'd O'er with flames instead of grasses, Which before the wind were swaying, Just, as in the burning August, Bend the ripe ears of the harvest; So vast the burning plain extended That no eye could reach its limits: In the midst of it were lying, Wrapp'd in flames, unnumber'd people, Through whose hands and feet were driven Stakes and pins of burning iron, Nailing them unto the earth; On their entrails, fiery serpents Gnawed for ever, and the wretches, In their agonizing torments, Bit the ground, and then expiring, Woke again to life and suffering; Then the vengeful demons threw me In the flames, which quickly vanished At the sacred name I called on. Then, I came where they were healing These same wounds with potent caustic, Pouring o'er the hideous ulcers Melted lead and burning rosin;â Who at this will not afflict him? Who at this will not uplift him? Who at this will feel no sorrow? Who will not despair and tremble? Then I saw, from out a mansion, Issuing from its walls and doorway, Flames arise, as when fire seizes On an earthly house, it bursts forth By whatever vent it findeth; This, they told me, was the Villa Of EnjoymentâRecreation's Bathâwhere women who indulged in Unguents, odours, rouge, and washes, In the other life, were punished: There I entered, and saw in it, Bathing in a snow-filled basin, Many fair and lovely women; In the water they were standing, Circled round by snakes and serpentsâ Which, of these cold icy billows, Were the syrens and the dolphinsâ There their limbs were stiff and frozen, In the clear, transparent crystal, And their hair on end was standing, And their teeth together striking;â Then they led me to a mountain Which upraised its lofty forehead Through the heavens' blue veil of crystal; On its summit, a volcano Blazed afar, from out whose crater Flames burst forth, and burning lava, In whose slow and blazing current I saw many souls descending; When they reached the base, returning Once again they climbed the mountain, Thus for many times repeating Their descending and ascending; Then a burning vapour blowing, Made me quickly seek an exit From this wild volcanic region: Forth I issued, and experienced A new wind upon the outside, On whose wing came myriad legions. Then, 'mid blows and many insults, I approached another quarter: There it seemed that many spirits, I had known elsewhere, were gathered Into one vast congregation, Where, although 'twas plain they suffered, Still they looked with joyous faces, Wore a peaceable appearance, Uttered no impatient accents, But with moisten'd eyes uplifted Towards the heavens, appeared imploring Pity, and their sins lamenting. This, in truth, was Purgatory, Where the sins that are more venial Are purged out; the angry demons, Seeing that I did not tremble, Rather that I waxed in courage, Tried upon me greater horrors: To a river did they lead me, Flowers of fire were on its margin, Liquid sulphur was its current, Many-headed hydrasâserpentsâ Monsters of the deep were in it; It was very broad, and o'er it Lay a bridge, so slight and narrow That it seemed a thin line only; It appeared so weak and fragile That the slightest weight would sink it: Here thy pathway lies, they told me, O'er this bridge so weak and narrow; And, for thy still greater horror, Look at those who've pass'd before thee: Then I look'd, and saw the wretches, Who the passage were attempting, Fall amid the sulphurous current, Where the snakes with teeth and talons Tore them in a thousand pieces; Notwithstanding all these horrors, I, the name of God invoking, Undertook the dreadful passage, And undaunted by the billows, Or the winds that blew around me, Reached the other side in safety. Here within a wood I found me, So delightful and so fertile, That the past was all forgotten; On my path rose stately cedars, Laurelsâall the trees of Eden, While the ground, with rose-leaves scattered, Spread its white and verdant carpet; Tender birds in all the branches Told their amorous complainings To the many murmuring streamlets, To the thousand crystal fountains. Then I saw a stately city, Which amid the heavens uplifted Many pinnacles and turrets; Precious gold composed its portals, All with flashing diamonds garnish'd, Topaz, emerald, and ruby, Intermix'd their varied lustre; Ere I reached the gates, they open'd, And the Saints in long procession Came to meet me, men and women, Young and old, and youths and maidens, All approached serene and happy; Choirs of Seraphim and Angels, Breathing Heaven's delicious music, Sweetly sung divinest anthems. After these at length approached me The resplendentâthe most gloriousâ The great Patrickâthe Apostle. Much that dazzling sight rejoiced me, For by it I was enabled To fulfil my early promise, In my lifetime to behold him. He and all the rest embraced me, Pleased at my extreme good fortune; Bidding me farewell, he told me That no living man could enter That most glorious, happy city; But that I, to earth returning, Should await God's time and pleasure. Back the proper way I wandered Unobstructed by the demons, And at length approached the entrance, When you came to seek and see me. Since I have escaped this danger, Holy fathers, all I covet Is to live and die amongst you. For with this is now concluded The historic legend told us By Dionysius the great Carthusian, With Henricus Salteriensis, Cesarius HeisterbachÃ©nsis Matthew Paris, and Ranulphus, Monbrisius, Marolicus Siculus, David Rothe, and the judicious Primate over all Hibernia, Bellarmino, Beda, Serpi, Friar Dymas, Jacob Sotin, Messingham, and in conclusion The belief and pious feeling Which have everywhere maintained it: The following is the original of this confused list of authorities. The text appears to be very imperfect as to some of the more obscure names; I have corrected a few palpable errors, but in one or two instances, I must confess, I have been somewhat in doubt as to the particular writer indicated by Calderon. âPara que con esta acabe La historia, que nos refiere Dionisio, el gran Cartusiano, Con Enrique Saltarense, Cesario, Mateo Rodulfo, Domiciano Esturbaquense, Membrosio, Marco Marulo, David Roto, y el prudente Primado de toda Hibernia, Belarmino, Beda, Serpi, Fray Dimas, Jacob Solino, Mensignano, y finalmente La piedad y la opinion Cristiana, que lo defiende.â That the drama may be ended, And your plaudits may begin. END OF THE PURGATORY OF SAINT PATRICK.</field>
