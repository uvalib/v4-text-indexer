      <field name="fulltext">SCENE I. —QUEEN MAB'S STUDY—STALACTITE GROTTO, BY MOONLIGHT. Fairy Court discovered at their revelry. SONG, Hobgoblin.—Air, ‘Dixey's Land.’ [The celebrated Comic Song, ‘On the Sands,’ to the Air of Dixey's Land, is published in the Musical Treasury, Nos. 1203–4, price 6d., by the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's.] I wonder where Queen Mab has got to, Out of the way in her fairy grotto? When at hand, understand, it was planned, we should stand. We are summoned here, but why or wherefore, Isn't quite so clear, and therefore, We, the band of her land, can't, off hand, understand. But I wish that I was Fancy! Chorus. [Without.] Hallo! hallo! Hobg. That sound, I'm sure, was not encore; But I wish that I was Fancy! Chorus. Hallo! hallo! who wished that he was Fancy? [Jack O'Lantern passes across the stage. Hobg. Friend Jack O'Lantern, sent by Mab, attends, I give you one toast more, come! ‘Mabsent friends.’ Enter Queen Mab, in her chariot, drawn by Glowworms. Mab. Of this unseemly clamour, what's the reason? Which of you here thus dared to utter treason? Who would usurp Queen Mab's established throne? Who wished that he could bear the name I own? I needn't ask, it's that great clumsy elf, Hobgoblin, who thus far forgot himself. Hobg. I didn't mean it, really, I declare— It's catching, there is something in the air. Doomed, for a certain time, to walk the night In London streets, for doing things not right, Where'er I went, that negro serenade Was hummed, drummed, strummed, or on the organ played, Until my past offences have, most clearly, Been, by this torture, punished most severely. Mab. It should have taught yer better. Hobg. Yes, be sure, Through change of air, I got the ‘Perfect Cure.’ Mab. Attend, and learn why, breaking up your sport, I here have summoned all my fairy court. Our empire's threatened [Sensation.]—not by feeble foes, That may be vanquished soon as we oppose; Nor does rebellion sow our land with weeds, We are in that happy state where none see seeds. But mortals set our influence at defiance: They have learned our secret, and they call it science. All that was once the work of fairy elves, Putting the steam on, they perform themselves. Science does everything on earth now, drat it! Hobg. I know, I've been in town and seen them at it. Through earth, sea, air, alike they take their trips; Underground railways—iron-plated ships! They make the sun take pictures, ten a minute, Drain the New River, and see nothing in it; Spread a vast net-work over all the houses, That cits may talk with their suburban spouses; Provide a Thames Embankment, and, what's more, A great high level for a great eye-sore, Through which, I may be pardoned for remarking, Dead dogs, how strange so e'er, will get to Barking. Mab. Enough! my object is to shew, this hour, That Fairy Land does yet retain its power. Puck. ‘I'll put a girdle round about the earth In forty minutes’— Mab. What would that be worth? Mortals would beat you hollow, sweet simplicity,— It's done in half the time, by electricity. I have it, I'll encounter them with one Of their own weapons—soon as said 'tis done. Appear, thou sprite, that can the public seize, That canst assume the form best shaped to please; That can secure, in every variety, That one thing needful known as notoriety! To catch the eye and year both day and night meant, Come, Spirit of the Age, in Great Excitement— Appearance of the Great Excitement. [The celebrated Comic Song, ‘The Great Excitement!’ is published in the Musical Treasury, No, 1201, prics 3d., by the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's.] Gt Ex. Behold the thing you've summoned to appear! I am the Great Excitement of the year! I'm popularity—the sort of thing That never fails the money in to bring. Sometimes I am a song, some simple theme; Sometimes a sort of ‘Colleen Bawn’ I seem; Sometimes on ‘Change I am a likely spec’, Or on tight ropes appear, to risk my neck; Sometimes I leap from what, in former days, Was called a swing—now christened the trapeze, Sometimes, to spur John Bull, I give my views, Of great gorillas, or get shrewd on shrews;— Or, as a racing Indian, have my fun, For racy novelties will always run. Sometimes I make even Shakespeare's self give place, Giving French polish to Othello's face, And turn those wondrous works he gave the stage, Into ‘Sensation’ dramas for the age. In short, as acrobat, play, sermon, song, I'm everything by turns, and nothing long. Mab. The very thing! For me this elf shall skip. Now, mortals, I shall ‘have ye on the hip!’ But tell me that which lasts, despite all times? Gt Ex. Nothing so long as Christmas Pantomimes! The old remember what they liked as boys; The young folks always relish fun and noise. Plenty of mirth, that's all you need look after; Their great excitement is no end of laughter. Search for a subject in your fairy tales, That is a source, we know, that never fails. Mab. I like the notion—then they can't resist us: And you, of course, will in this scheme assist us. Gt Ex. At Sadler's Wells I'll meet you, honour bright! There great excitement's found on Boxing Night. ‘Cherry and Fair Star’ for your theme retain, And all shall own your fairy power again. SONG, Great Excitement.—Air, ‘Lillibulero.’ Little things hate of science the law— Law! pshaw! don't care a straw; But never too many of fairies they saw. Send for your hero, make him appear, O!— Never you fear, O! I will be near, O! Doing the best that we can. Can, can, I am your man; Oh! we have hit on a capital plan! Chorus. Send for our hero—let him appear, O! We never fear, O! he will be near, O! Doing the best that he can. Gt Ex. Little boys like, or I'm mistaken, Taken, waken, or get shaken, To have their sides with laughter achin', Clown or Pierrot, we'll have here, O! Shouts when near, O! hear, O! dear, O! Harlequin's wonderful man— Man, plan, do all you can; Oh! we've hit on a wonderful plan. [Chorus as before, and exeunt Omnes.—The Scene changes to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONG, Hobgoblin.—Air, ‘Dixey's Land.’ [The celebrated Comic Song, ‘On the Sands,’ to the Air of Dixey's Land, is published in the Musical Treasury, Nos. 1203–4, price 6d., by the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's.] I wonder where Queen Mab has got to, Out of the way in her fairy grotto? When at hand, understand, it was planned, we should stand. We are summoned here, but why or wherefore, Isn't quite so clear, and therefore, We, the band of her land, can't, off hand, understand. But I wish that I was Fancy! Chorus. [Without.] Hallo! hallo! Hobg. That sound, I'm sure, was not encore; But I wish that I was Fancy! Chorus. Hallo! hallo! who wished that he was Fancy?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE II. —SEA-SHORE OF ISLAND.— THE ABODE OF THE CORSAIR. Enter Fair Star, from Cave. Fair S. Cherry, where are you, Cherry? Don't you hear me? You know I'm wretched when you are not near me. Cherry! 'tis Fair Star calls!—up first, I see; Do you call it fair, to get the start of me? SONG, Fair Star.—Air, ‘Young Man from the Country.’ As shouting is no service, at once I'll go and look, As I so easily might do, in some isolated nook; For, though the Corsair and his wife are kind, I like to see My young man in this country, keeping company with me. It isn't quite a brother's place that Cherry fills, I know; Nor is it quite a sister's love that I on him bestow. Though who we are, and what we are, is quite a myster-ee, That young man to this country came in company with me. There's Captain Kyd, a corsair—no coarser man, I'm told, Who will not let let the public eye his privateer behold; But I don't care to walk with him when Cherry is with me, For two, you know, is company, which is not the case with three. So, with all his bold effrontery, he can't get over me. [Spoken.] So light his footstep on the sand, that hence, Go where he will, he leaves no evidence. On the sea-shore, perchance, he seek his wherry. Cherry. [Without.] Fair Star! Fair S. He comes! and I see surely Cherry. Enter Cherry. Cherry. Oh! Fair Star, look! I've found a pretty shell. Fair S. Yes, and, I find, a pretty mess as well; All over sand. Cherry. Let this hand that sand smother; Your pretty scrape will quite efface the other. SONG, Cherry.—Air, ‘Shells of Ocean.’ When somewhere we've experience bought, A watchguard on the cheap, be sure, We feel that we were wrong, and ought To think how swells were done before. And so I've said, at every stage, By toys I can see we're beguil'd; We all shell out, from youth to age, And never leave off being a child. Change of Air, to ‘The Prairie Flower.’ [Music published by the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's, in No. 1216, of the Musical Treasury, price 3d.] Here's a pretty fairy, never makes me wild, Mark her quiet beauty, quite unspiled; And no little scrimmage, from any fault of mine, Ever makes her weep or whine. Here's her peaceful dwelling—I'm the lovely child, Always for her scheming pleasures wild, Bringing for her trifles gather'd here and there, Trifles light as summer air. Fair Star's a lily, joyous and free, Or anything else that she chooses to be; She's a perfect cure for a gloomy hour, So I rose early, my fairy flower, So early in the morning, Before the break of day. Fair S. But tell me, Cherry— Cherry. Tumble down, that's all! Not the first time through you I've had a fall. Fair S. Through me! Cherry. Well, that you caused it, is most true; And didn't I deeply fall in love with you? Fair S. Oh! Cherry! Cherry. [Kissing her.] Not designed, but accidental, Linking the useful with the ornamental. But for this morning,—as I chanc'd to gaze On this wide waste, where we're a pair of stays, Looking upon that vast expanse of blue, And thinking I'd to Indy-go for you— Fair S. Don't, Cherry? How you talk! your fancy's straying. Cherry. Well, as—let's see—‘What were the wild waves saying? Oh! ah!—the azure main. Well, looking in it— Excuse my being poetical—half a minute— I saw— Fair S. You saw! Cherry. I saw that splendid shell, And from it came— Fair S. Go on! Cherry. Now mark me! Fair S. Well? Cherry. These words, slow uttered, in a still small voice, ‘Be Fair Star, youth, thy matrimonial choice.’ Youth was the term, instead of ‘Hi! young man!’ Which vulgar folks will call you when they can. Fair S. Was it a treble voice! Cherry. Well, 'twas not its fault, O, But the bay salt had made it a bass alto. Eager to get the shell, I dashed that way in Then came the spray—I fell—and hence my sprain. But place it to your ear, and on this spot, too— Listen! Corsine. [Without.] You tiresome hussy—where have you got to? Cherry. That's Corsine's voice—she's in her scolding mood; That threatening rolling-pin forbodes no good. Enter Corsine, from Cave. Corsine. Is this, you idle pair, the sort of way You go on, when my husband is away! Making of sand great puddings on the beach, Or digging holes as deep as spades can reach? Children that have been brought up so genteel, Should more respect for their superiors feel. You, miss, to music and embroidery go; And you, sir, ought your geography to know— Your navigation—how the currents run— Cherry. [Aside.] In all your dumplings, I ne'er saw but one. Corsine. What will the governor say?—he'll soon return— When he finds out you've nothing got to learn? Cherry. That's it: we think it time to leave off school; Of arithmetic I've practised every rule; All that your books can teach to me is plain. I've gone through all— Corsine. Go through them all again. My orders are to keep you close at college, Go on continually acquiring knowledge, And then, when everything you know, we'll see What else besides to teach you there may be. [Horn sounds. There is his vessel—that's his signal—hark! The jolly dog! I can't mistake his barque. Enter Pirates, bearing chests of gold and silver, they cross stage, and enter Cave—then enter Captain Kyd, the Corsair. Kyd. My wife! my children! clasped within these arms! Corsine, still blooming with resistless charms! And you, my little ones, grown up so tall, My benediction take—bless! bless you all! Don't think 'tis often that this way I feel, The man does soften but the Corsair's steel! Yet, when I think how much to you I owe, (More than I ever shall repay, I know.) I can't help thinking—is it time for dinner? Corsine. The banquet waits— Kyd. Then we'll refresh the inner. Some more I would have said, but bye and bye— Though full the mind, the body craves supply. [Exeunt Cherry and Fair Star into Cave. SONG, Kyd—Air, Old Country Melody. [To Corsine. You have a dinner, I guess, Which will suit my fancy right, The sort of thing to eat when You've got an appetite; Whatever joints you may have saved, Got out at once should be, For nothing in your larder, ma'am, Can come amiss to me. As you'll soon see, &amp;c. [Dances off Corsine into Cave. 2nd Verse, solus. Though a buccaneer I am, I have been much better taught, Than boarding British ships, in A way I didn't ought. Whatever folks they have on board, Why there I'd let 'em be, And so, when nations fight, observe A strict neutrality— Upon the sea, &amp;c. [Exit into Cave. Re-enter Cherry and Fair Star, from cave. Fair S. What can he want to talk with us about? Cherry. A day's excursion somewhere, dear, no doubt. Fair S. Oh, Cherry, I'm so tired of this existence, Waves in the foreground— Cherry. Nothing in the distance. Fair S. A dreary landscape, not the least variety. Cherry. In water colours, but with no society. Fair S. Of what the world is doing not a glimpse. Cherry. And nothing to be got, but health and shrimps. Fair S. To me this isle's no better than a prison. And would be worse, if 'twere not also his'n. Cherry. Perpetual sameness—nothing to discern. So dull this bay, it really might be Herne. Fair S. In fact, to put our words in language stronger, Cherry. We won't— Fair S. Consent— Cherry. To stop here— Both. Any longer. Enter Captain Kyd, at back. Kyd. What's this? rebellion! Do my ears deceive me? Can I believe my eyes? Does smelling leave me? Or do my olfact'ries right my brain inform? And I smell a rat that's brewing in the storm? Ungrateful children, why, oh! why did I save yer? To be rewarded by such bad behaviour! But no, perhaps you haven't heard your story. Cherry. We've heard it every morning, I assure ye. Kyd. Your memory's short—I'll tell it you again— It must be— Cherry. True—what must be, must, that's plain. Kyd. It must be nearly eighteen years ago, Since first— Cherry. Of course—you've often told us so. Kyd. When, one dark night, being out a buccaneering, I saw a boat— Cherry. 'Bout one mile off appearing. Kyd. Shiver my timbers—then I used to swear— Says I to my first mate, ‘Jack, just look there.’ Cherry. I know— Kyd. And, tacking round— Fair S. You in a minute Cherry. Hauled in the boat— Fair S. And found two children in it. Kyd. I know you'll scarce believe it—but you shall— One was a boy, the other was—a gal, And on her brow a star I chanced to see. Fair S. It startles you—it's nought that star tells me. Kyd. Home did I bring them to this very spot, And brought them up—they cost a precious lot. But Fair Star's hair, when combed, did jewels yield, And thus a comely heiress stood revealed; And so of wealth I thus amassed a store. Cherry. We have heard this story fifty times before. Kyd. Which now to foreign lands I've been to sell, What have I done? Cherry. Why, I think, very well. Kyd. I mean, what have I done in perpetuity, That I should go and lose that hair annuity? It is too much, each tress to me's a treasure! Fair S. All that you like to take, is yours with pleasure, But we have made our minds up to depart. Kyd. Ha! is it so? And would you break my heart? Come hither, then—I've got no time for fooling, At least you owe me for three quarters' schooling; And I shall comb your hair, ere off you roam. And so you'd brush, eh, would you, miss, back home? Set in those brilliant ringlets I comb down, Are jewels truly worthy of a crown. Rubies aud diamonds—yes, that's no misnomer, Mesmeric sight—I'm in a state of coma. What! part with these? No! Go, if you've a mind, Free as before—your hair you leave behind. What ho! my scissors—these rich curls will do; If you cut off, why, I can cut off, too. Fair S. First catch your hair—to Cherry I shall cling. Cherry. [Interposing.] Monster, forbear! Do you call this the thing? Kyd. She's mine! Resign her! Cherry. Not for a king's ransom. Kyd. Unhand her! Cherry. What! for treatment so unhandsome? Kyd. Why then, rash youth, let your own head beware. Cherry. 'Tis well—come on, and of your own take care. [Fight, and pause. Kyd. He parries every thrust—I can't hit through it. Cherry. You quite forget, you taught me how to do it. Kyd. Ha! say'st thou so? Then down, at last, I've brought you— This is a private dodge I never taught you. [Fight resumed—Cherry is defeated. Appearance of the Spirit of the Shell. Spirit. Cease this rude discord: it was I inspired Both these young folks to go where they desired. I gave to Fair Star's hair its magic dower. [To Kyd.] And you from me to save them had the power. Where'er they go, henceforth their steps attend, Their constant guide, philosopher, and friend. Kyd. Well, come, I'll make it up—I don't bear malice. Spirit. Of noble birth, and cradled in a palace, These children, now grown up, must thither go. Cherry. Thank you; but we the right address don't know. Spirit. Fear not! a golden galley, close at hand, Will now conduct you—where it stops, you land. Fair Star, know this, that Cherry's not your brother; So those who love, may still love one another. [Appearance of the Golden Galley, attended by Sea Nymphs.—Embarcation of Cherry and Fair Star.—Ballet, and change of Scene, to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE III. —THE COUNCIL-CHAMBER OF KING WHITEHEART. Enter the King, attended by his Ministers and Guards. King. Talk not to me of patience, good Koo-too. Bah! I could bear barbarity from you, Rebellion from my subjects; nay, be seen To be most cruelly hen-pecked by my queen; But to be ruled, submit myself and nation, I won't, to any mother-in law's dictation. Koo-too. Yet, sire— King. Oh yes, I am a sigher, I know, A sigher after days gone long ago; When I could do just what I liked, and did it, Without this tyrant dowager to forbid it. But I'll take your advice, assert my sway; Nay, have for dinner what I like this day. Bring in the bill of fare—at once I'll choose. Enter Head Cook, with Bill of Fare.—At the same time, the Dowager Queen Blackheart enters, with Train. Queen. You wouldn't me that privilege refuse? Cook, bring it hither! do you hear? obey! That is the dish we'll have—now walk away. King. But, madam, surely— Queen. Surely I know best. Dismiss your minister! King. But I protest— Queen. Protest! what's that? Do you, in this dominion Dare for yourself to form the least opinion? He is dismissed—I've done it. Feintise, bless her, My waiting-woman, shall be his successor. Enter Feintise. Feintise. Obedient to your voice, behold, I come; The reins of government I'll hold like some Who for the greatest number things have done— That greatest number being number one. King. But, really, this is pitching it too strong! Queen. Reflect! my arm's both muscular and long. King. It is; I know it—own it—oft have felt it. Her heart is stone—her vinegar can't e'en melt it. Enter a Herald. Herald. Oh, sire! such news! King. Then tell it quick and short. Herald. A splendid ship has just put into port. A Prince and Princess, as I think, are in it. King. [Delighted.] Aha! Queen. [Dismayed.] Aha! King. We'll see them—bring them in this minute. [Exit Herald, Queen. [Apart.] A Prince and Princess!—should it be— Feintise. It shan't. Queen. Those that we long ago— Feintise. It arn't—it can't. Queen. My mind misgives me: I'd a dream last night. Feintise. And so had I—hot suppers are not right. Queen. But pooh!— Feintise. Stuff! nonsense!— Queen. All such things must be— Feintise. To speak politely, violin de dee. Omnes. They come! Enter Cherry and Fair Star, preceded by Pages, bearing presents of Jewels, &amp;c., for the King. King. Welcome, illustrious strangers, to our shore! Our ammunition we fired off before; But though those forts, in consequence, are mute, My forte's politeness—here's our royal salute. [Kisses Fair Star. Another, in the Prince's honour, too! Cherry. He thanks your majesty, but that will do. Queen. [Aside.] Do you see that star? It is— Feintise. Hush! not so loud! Cherry. We have come to stay. King. You really do me proud. Cherry. First, as a trifle, pray accept this treasure. Feintise. Thank you, the Queen receives it with much pleasure. Cherry. The Queen! Fair Star. The Queen! King. [Confused.] Yes—that is, the Queen Mother; I ought to have made you known to one another: The Dowager Queen Blackheart! How absurd, But I can't remember names I never heard. Cherry. Cherry, and Fair Star! King. To be sure, of course— The more you see of her, you'll like her worse. Queen. Those features—yes!—'tis eighteen years this day! My smelling bottle, quick—I faint away. [Exit Queen, hastily. Feintise. She swoons—you ought to be ashamed—but hence, Burnt feathers, sal volatile, and scents. [Exeunt Feintise and Blackheart Guards. Cherry. The lady seems amazed! Fair Star. That swoon's no sham. King. Ah! you are not yet used to her—I am. Now she stands nearest to our royal throne. Once on a time I had heirs, but they are gone: There's no Circassian cream in all this town Which can restore lost heirs to this same crown. Enter Feintise. Feintise. The Queen demands your presence. King. Eh? What more! She had all the presents that were brought before. Well, well, I'm coming. Pray excuse me now, I see our royal self is in a row. [Exeunt King Whiteheart and Guards. Feintise. You are some great King's children, I don't doubt it. Fair S. We really don't know very much about it; It's not unlikely, though. Feintise. She right suspected. Wrecked, and not die. Fair S. But here we were directed. Feintise. Ah! all you want to make you happy, daughter, Is the Singing Apple and the Dancing Water. Fair S. The Singing Apple? Cherry. Where do you find those fellers? Oh, happily singing at the Cider Cellars. Feintise. Only to smell it, makes you talk quite witty. The Dancing Water keeps you ever pretty. Fair S. That would be nice! Feintise. Then, have you never heard Of that great rarity, the Talking Bird? Fair S. Never! Feintise. Why that tells everything on earth, And would disclose the secret of your birth. Fair S. Oh! that we must have; Cherry, step and fetch it. Feintise. You'll have to go a great way off to catch it. But reach the mountains of perpetual snow, You'll catch it very nicely there, I know. Fair S. Expose yourself to danger, Cherry, don't you; But these you'll get for Fair Star, Cherry, won't you? Feintise. [Aside.] My hints, I see, have made a strong impression. Cherry. Consider them all three in your possession. At once I'll go, for what my love wants yet, Never shall Fair Star say she couldn't get. QUINTETTE and CHORUS.—Air, ‘Off she goes.’ Cherry. Think no more of the danger run, Consider it just the same as done; In me you behold, what some folks call, A nice young man for a party small. Fair S. I really don't like you to go at the price, It's quite an alarming sacrifice. Queen. [Entering.] Oh! say, is it done? Succeeds my plan? Omnes. Oh! he's a remarkably brave young man. Chorus. Off on his journey away he goes; He can't mistake if he follows his nose. But only think of the danger ran; He is a remarkably brave young man. King. The thought of such valour inflames my heart. Take a bit of cold something before you start. Queen. [Aside.] A bitter cold journey he'll have o'er the snow. King. Wouldn't you rather? Don't say no. As for Miss Fair Star, fear her not. Queen. Long since she should have been—never mind what. Cherry. The apple and all to you I'll give, And we'll ever afterwards happily live. [Chorus repeated.—Exeunt Omnes, and change of Scene to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE IV. —THE VALLEY OF THE GRANITE ROCKS. Enter Captain Kyd, dressed as an Attendant on Cherry. Kgd. Come on, Prince Cherry! I've got far a head; I wish we'd gone some other road instead. This is a dreary spot—looks dark and glum, too, A sort of valley—just what Kyd has come to. Lie there, his carpet-bag, till he o'ertakes me;— I won't go any further till he makes me. SONG, Kyd.—Air, ‘Uncle Sam,’ or ‘Aunt Sally.’ [Music published by the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's, in No. 1223, of the Musical Treasury, price 3d.] No joke—I a flunkey am, Though once I was a buccy— Neer. From that escaped I am, And don't you think I'm lucky? But when we change our mortal state, It ain't all for the best, I vow; As buccaneer I wages war, I war with wages now. With a white face, aha! Oh dear, in a funk I am; For here I've come some miles to-night, 'Cause I a flunkey am. Right folks, true I a flunkey am, Became so from this morning; But if such treatment I receive, I'll give my master warning, Nor longer drag his carpet-bag, Since he so bad behaves; But I'll be off to England, Which always helps the slaves. I'm right, folks, huzza! My master he'll stand Sam; He knows I've come some miles to-night, And a poor flunkey am. Ho! hilliho! I hear his footsteps nearer. Heigh ho! much hoeing don't the route make clearer. Enter Cherry. Cherry. Some fifteen leagues already, ah! 'tis well. Kyd. There's not a finger-post the road to tell. Cherry. Straight on we go! Kyd. Politeness, then, is due; I know my proper place, sir—after you. Cherry. What! you a pirate and this danger dodging? Kyd. Ah! then 'twas boarding—now I dread the lodging. Oh! look! what's that?— Appearance of the Canary Bird. Cherry. A poor weak bird, that's all, Exhausted, famished, and about to fall. This broken biscuit may its life sustain. It eats—revives—Dickey's himself again. [Canary Bird disappears—Fairy takes its place. Oh! wondrous change, most marvellous Canary! Can e'er a form like that one be a fairy? Kyd. I thought that bird was going to moult, ere long, Our bird's now changed the burden of its song. Fairy. I am a fairy, and reward the kind; That which you seek I'll tell you where to find. First, to the Forest of Enchantment go— My fairy guides the nearest way shall show. [Appearance of the Fairy Guides, who lead off Cherry and Kyd to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE V. —THE FOREST OF ENCHANTMENT. Enter Fairies, conducting Cherry and Kyd—Fairies vanish. Cherry. They have led us here, and strangely disappeared. Kyd. Though lost to sight, to memory much endeared. Cherry. Look! all is light—the forest seems to kindle. Kyd. This bank—that branch—a most transparent swindle. I'll take no shares in such a speculation. Cherry. For our arrival an illumination. The road's lit up; what glorious lights attend it. Kyd. Well, if the road's slit up, leave them to mend it. Cherry. But where's the Dancing Water we should bring? Water can never dance without a spring. Kyd. No! and the Dancing Water, if it jumps, Should be provided with a pair of pumps. Demon Head appears. Demon. Go back, rash youth, the spring cannot be found— It lies a very long way underground. [Head disappears. Cherry. Oh! that's a bore. Kyd. It looks as if it would be; But bores are never in the place they should be. Cherry. What if we dig? Kyd. Well, though a part we stole, I think we should be gainers on the whole. Foxes, and other animals, pass across the stage. Cherry. Look there! behold those foxes, how they rush, Tally-high-ho! we're just in time for the brush. Moles, Badgers, &amp;c., pass across. I see why this selection should occur, O, Why these are all the members for our burrow. Kyd. Already they've thrown out a deal of stuff, Ah! other members don't do that enough. There's a deep hole—deep as the Caves of Chedder. Cherry. Now, then, to take a most tremendous header. [Cherry plunges in and disappears. Kyd. Ah! I'll leave that alone—I've long suspected My header-cation's shamefully neglected. Cherry, reappears, bearing the Golden Vase of Dancing Waters. Cherry. I have it—see it dances without stopping! I hope 'twill keep— Kyd. It ought to with that hopping. Cherry. [Reading inscription.] ‘Whoever drinks more handsome will become.’ Kyd. I don't require it—that's of use to some. Cherry. One task's achieved: the Singing Apple next— But which the road—I'm terribly perplexed. Kyd. Look, master, look, in what a graceful manner That vase is dancing the Varsoviana. Cherry. I see—it means by motion that it makes, That we should follow every step it takes. Kyd. Then for a reel of three, first set, or Lancers; For all these questions ballets do find dancers. [Scene changes to</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VI. —THE GREAT LIBYAN DESERT. Enter Cherry and Kyd, preceded by the Dancing Waters. Cherry. Still it runs on—no! here the water stops! How strange, that on a desert place it drops. Kyd. If still these waters run—they are deep be sure of it; And well know what we're after—you'll see more of it. Cherry. What shall we say? This cup my heart revives. Apple. [From tree.] May the present moment be the worst of our lives. Kyd. It seems to me, some toast-master's at hand, Apple. When a defender's wanted for our land, May all true Volunteers cry, ‘Here we are,’ Go it my pippins—hip, pip, pip—hurrah! Cherry. A jolly place, this seems—I know not why. Apple. [Sings.] ‘For he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny!’ Cherry. What sound was that? whence came that cheerful strain? Apple. The Singing Apple will oblige again. [Apple comes forward. I think, although you had heard the air before, You did me the great honour of encore. Cherry. Quite right,—I'm glad your friend, the Dancing Waters, Was not too proud to cut you in these quarters. SONG, Apple.—Air, ‘Hot Codlings.’ [Music published by the Music-Publishing Company, 19 Peter's Hill, St. Paul's, in Nos. 823–23?, of the Musical Treasury, price 6d.] A wicked old woman, unforgiving had got, Sent two children to sea, in a way she should not. Now this wicked old woman, as I've been told, Did, not long ago, these two children behold; And to keep it quite dark she thought it no sin, To send them for me, in a mess to get— Cherry. In! [Trio.] Right, tol, tiddy-hiddy, as I bid'ee, Keep your eyes open rather wide, O! Apple. Now this wicked old woman—up in life she had got— Behaved to the king like—I won't say what; She tipped him a wink, for he wasn't so nice, So he tipped her another in a trice. With wickedness filled, from no crime she shrunk, And down to iniquity's depths she— Cherry. Precipitated herself? Kyd. Took a tremendous header? Apple. No, sunk! down, tiddy-iddy, as I bid'ee, Keep both your eyes open wide, O! Cherry. Then you are mine! Apple. Once touch me, and take care A sandstorm quick don't whirl you through the air. Cherry. Nay, I'm prepared with every risk to grapple. [To Kyd.] You take the Water—I'll secure the Apple! [Cherry and Kyd attempt to seize the Vase and Apple, and are blown off by a Simoom.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE VII. —THE SNOW MOUNTAINS IN THE FROZEN REGIONS. The Little Green Bird, Cherry, and Kyd discovered. Cherry. We've had, at least, a blowing up for going 'Mongst these snow mountains, that is worth one's knowing. Kyd. It's all right, master, still the fairies guide you, Look! there's the little Talking-Bird beside you. Bird. Who touches me, quick petrified is seen. You can't touch me—I'm not so very green. Kyd. Sprinkling some salt upon your tail might do it. Bird. For that assault you have dearly had to rue it. Cherry. Oh! fie! my pet, some other plan we'll try. Bird. Beware! take care!—or you will pet-ri-fy. Cherry. I must have you, and then my task is done. Poll! what's o'clock? Poor Poll!— Bird. It's just struck one. [Cherry is petrified. Enter Fair Star. Fair S. By love directed, hither have I flown. Alas! too late, see! both are turned to stone. From Cherry's fate the bird might surely snatch him. Apple. Sing him a song, and, whilst he listens, catch him. Fair S. I thank my friend, who that same hint let fall; Though whence it came, I've no idea at all. SONG, Fair Star.—Air, ‘Cruiskeen Lawn.’ They may sing about a bird, Of which no one ever heard, But to me it has occurred, on this morn, To mind, among these beeches The finest of its species, Which I can't leave to mourn, forlorn-lorn-lorn. Crammer! creeping dusk in, I'm all over goose-skin; Not quite knowing whose skin his family adorn, I must make that bird my prize ere he's gone. Lumps of sugar you shall see, In your cage provided be, If you'll only come with me every morn, Fresh groundsel, too, I'll bring, If you like that sort of thing, And all day you're free to sing, on the lawn, lawn, lawn. Crammer! creeping dusk in, &amp;c. Bird. That's rather pretty—wakeful I can't keep, All sentimental ballads make me sleep. Apple. Secure him now, he has no power to hurt you. Water. To liberate the others, I have virtue. [Reanimates Cherry &amp; Kyd. Enter King, Queen, Feintise, and Guards. Queen. We are on their track, we have them with their prizes. Cherry. But, King— Queen. Pooh! pooh! he says whatever I says. Here is the Apple, Bird, and Dancing Water. Bird. Forbear, King Whiteheart, Fair Star is your daughter— Prince Cherry is her cousin, long unknown— Stolen, that Blackheart might possess her throne. Queen. Nay, then, my guards, down with the constitution, I'll triumph yet, I'll have a revolution. [Guards seize King, Cherry, and Feintise. Fair S. The star upon my forehead! If you are near, Fairy, who placed it, forrard and appear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TRANSFORMATION SCENE. Fairy appears.—Pantomime Characters remain. Fairy. Short is your triumph, here new scenes arise, And each must now assume some new disguise. Cherry and Fair Star, lovers still combine To please, as Harlequin and Columbine. You, King, the pattern of a royal spoon, Stir about quickly as a Pantaloon. Whilst you, Queen Blackheart, shall receive, paid down, Bumps, blows, and buffets, your reward as Clown. In merry sport present, to suit the time, A Grand New Exhibition Pantomime.
