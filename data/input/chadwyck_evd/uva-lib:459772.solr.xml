      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Constantine Mr. Smith. Dalmatius Mr. Griffin. Crispus Mr. Betterton. Annibal Mr. Goodman. Lycinius Mr. Wiltshire. Arius Mr. Gillo. Labienus Mr. Perin. Eubolus Mr. Saunders. Sylvester Mr. Bowman. WOMEN. Fausta Mrs. Barrey. Serena Mrs. Cook. Angels, Priests, Guards, and Attendants.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by Mr. Goodman. What think ye meant wise Providence, when first Poets were made? I'd tell you, if I durst, That 'twas in Contradiction to Heaven's Word, That when its Spirit o're the Waters stir'd, When it saw All, and said That All was good, The Creature Poet was not understood. For, were it worth the Pains of six long Days, To mould Retailers of dull Third-Day-Plays, That starve out threescore Years in hopes of Bays. 'Tis plain they ne're were of the first Creation, But came by meer Equiv'cal Generation. Like Rats in Ships, without Coition bred; As hated too as they are, and unfed. Nature their Species sure must needs disown, Scarce knowing Poets, less by Poets known. Yet this poor Thing, so scorn'd, and set at nought, Ye all pretend to, and would fain be thought. Disabl'd wasting Whore-Masters are not Prouder to own the Brats they never got, Than Fumbling, Itching Rhimers of the Town, T' adopt some base-born Song that's not their own. Spite of his State, My Lord sometimes descends, To please the Importunity of Friends. The dullest he thought most for Business fit, 'Twill venture his bought Place, to aim at Wit. And though he sinks with his Imploys of State, Till Common Sense forsake him, he'll Translate. The Poet and the Whore alike complains, Of trading Quality, that spoils their Gains; The Lords will Write, and Ladies will have Swains. Therefore, all you who have Male Issue born, Under the Starving Sign of Capricorn; Prevent the Malice of their Stars in time, And warn them early from the Sin of Rhime: Tell 'em how Spencer starv'd, how Cowley mourn'd, How Butler's Faith and Service was return'd; And if such Warning they refuse to take, This last Experiment, O Parents, make! With Hands behind them see the Offender ty'd, The Parish Whip, and Beadle by his side. Then lead him to some Stall that does expose The Authors he loves most, there rub his Nose; Till like a Spaniel lash'd, to know Command, He by the due Correction understand, To keep his Brains clean, and not foul the Land. Till he against his Nature learn to strive, And get the Knack of Dullness how to thrive.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. COOK. Our Hero's happy in the Plays Conclusion, The holy Rogue at last has met Confusion: Though Arius all along appear'd a Saint, The last Act shew'd him a true Protestant. Eusebius, (for you know I read Greek Authors) Reports, that after all these Plots and Slaughters, The Court of Constantine was full of Glory, And every Trimmer turn'd Addressing Tory; They follow'd him in Herds as they were mad: When Clause was King, then all the World was glad. Whiggs kept the Places they possest before, And most were in a way of getting more; Which was as much as saying, Gentlemen, Here's Power and Money to be Rogues again. Indeed there were a sort of peaking Tools, Some call them Modest, but I call 'em Fools, Men much more Loyal, tho not half so loud; But these poor Devils were cast behind the Croud. For bold Knaves thrive without one Grain of Sense, But good Men starve for want of Impudence. Besides all these, there were a sort of Wights, (I think my Author calls them Teckelites;) Such hearty Rogues against the King and Laws, They favour'd even a Foreign Rebel's Cause. When their own damn'd Design was quash'd and aw'd, At least they gave it their good Word abroad. As many a Man, who, for a quiet Life, Breeds out his Bastard, not to nose his Wife. Thus o're their Darling Plot these Trimmers cry; And though they cannot keep it in their Eye, They bind it Prentice to Count Teckely. They believe not the last Plot, may I be curst, If I believe they e're believ'd the first. No wonder their own Plot, no Plot they think; The Man that makes it, never smells the Stink. And, now it comes into my Head, I'll tell Why these damn'd Trimmers lov'd the Turks so well. The Original Trimmer, though a Friend to no Man, Yet in his Heart ador'd a pretty Woman: He knew that Mahomet laid up for ever, Kind Black-ey'd Rogues, for every true Believer: And, which was more than mortal Man e're tasted, One Pleasure that for threescore Twelve-months lasted: To turn for this, may surely be forgiven: Who'd not be circumcis'd for such a Heav'n!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The First Act. Scene. 1st. Constantine sleeping in a Pavillion, Silvester standing at distance, two Angels descend with Banners in their hands. This Motto, In hoc signo vince, Writ in Gold. Sing. 1. Ang. Awake: O Constantine! awake; Or in thy sleep the Prospect take! Here in this hallow'd streaming Gold, The Prospect of thy Life behold: This Emblem of a bleeding Love, Shall both thy Cross and Triumph prove. For, alass! 'tis decreed by the Heavenly Doom, To purge thy past Crimes, there's a Torment to come. 2. Ang. Yet, after the Storm, believe in me, No more disturb'd thy thoughts shall be, But all Serene as a breathless Sea. Chor. And still thy Handmaid Victory, Where er'e thou go'st, shall wait on thee; And all shall end in Harmony. 3. Ang. speaks. Awake, and ponder the Celestial Song; Thy vow'd Conversion is delay'd too long. Awake; remember the Celestial Doom, That threatned Torments, and a Cross to come. Yet after all the Menaces of Fate, Be wash'd: And Calms shall on those Tempests wait, For true Repentance never comes too late. Angels ascend. Constantine, awakes. Const. Stay! I adjure you, by the Holy Name, That bows your Airy Heads; I charge you stay: They're gone: Those Beauteous Legates of the Skies; And left me puzling here to die in doubt, Unless Silvester guide me with a Clew, Through the dark Mazes of this folding Dream. Silv. To purge your past Crimes, there's a Torment to come. Ay, there the Torment too repeated thrice. Const. But say, what Torment? Silv. A dangerous Torment, govern'd by ill Stars: Which were I Emperour should be soon prevented. Const. By Heaven it shall by me. Silv. You must not Swear, Lest you shou'd be forsworn. Const. If Heaven require My Life as an Atonement for my Sins: Lead to the Altar, Saint, and I will bleed. Silv. I dare believe you would: But this is more. Const. More then my Life: Why, then 'tis Reputation. But I have learnt in Christian Schools to lay My Honour down. And own my self a Worm. To wash the Pilgrims Feet, to bid the Saints Tread on this Earth: This trash, this heap of Sin. Silv. But there's a Bosom Foe to Conquer yet, And there's my fear. Const. Your fear, my Saint, after what I have said? Silv. My fear, my Emperour, though you had sworn; Const. Had I a Race of Sons like Crispus dear, Hope of my vows, my Souldier and my Love Early Renown'd, and Pious from the Womb: Yet were my Bowels Foes to that Religion, Whose Infant growth I water'd with my Blood, I Swear by Heav'n, they should be mine no more. Silv. Your Son's the Angels care, and when he dies, The foremost of the Quire shall meet him with a Crown. But have you not a Wife? Const. You know I had A dear one, and by much my better part. Silv. But have you not another? Const. When she dy'd, All Beauty fled with her. Silv. This Beauty lives: Can you deny a Truth? Const. Silvester, why? Why dost thou press me thus, to my Confusion? Silv. Because this Beauty, Sir, may bring confusion. Const. Large as an Angels knowledg, be your own, And at one View, receive whole Nature in, Yet if you tax my Choice, with least dishonour, I must declare you wrong her. Silv. Then you are at least contracted to Maximinus Daughter A Heathen born? Const. But bred a Cherubin, She has all the Beauties, of her Sex below; And equal Virtues, with the blest above. Silv. Dares Constantine, the Christian so Renownd, Say this to me? Const. Dares any Saint deny't? Silv. That Fausta is not Guilty! Const. Ha! of what? Silv. Of all the ills, that shall attend your Life. Of allâ Const. Hold, holdâlest I fall out with Heaven. Silv. Of all the Blots, that shall in after times Stain your white Character, and blast your Fame: While weeping Readers shall lament your Story. Therefore away with her. Const. First, let me die. Penurious Heaven; and Oh! thou Niggard Saint, Did I not Offer you my Darling Son, With all my Race, as Victims to your Shrines If they were Guilty in a point of Faith, To wash their Heresies with Royal Blood? And do you grudge me one, but one poor Pleasure, For all the Pains of my Unwearied Wars? Then take my Life, take Empire, Glory, all, Take all I offer'd this Ungrateful Priest, Who in requital, will allow me nothing. Silv. Forgive me Heaven! my too officious Care, For interposing, in thy dark Decrees: In Christian patience, he is yet but young. Chastise him now: And make the Tryal strong. Const. What have I said, that I am past forgiveness? Your Silence argues me undone for ever: Yet think me not, so lost in desperate Love, But while offending I can kneel for Pardon. Silv. What I have offer'd to your Choice, Was not Commission'd me to say from Heaven; Therefore the pardon must be mutual. All I have urg'd was but a thoughtful boding: No more of that; be happy in your Love. Const. Oh! you have Charm'd me into Life agen; And fear not but she shall become a Christian; I must confess, that yet she is a Heathen, As such I Lov'd Her, in Her Fathers Court, Where first we Plighted vows in Arius hands But the dark Contract was so close Contriv'd, I wonder how you reach'd the Truth so soon: But Heaven reveal'd it, or you cou'd not know it; Since I may swear, She is not yet enjoy'd. Silv. By you! Const. By me? Your answer's short and home: Who shou'd possess her else? Silv. Young and a Heathen? Left in the Sensual Maximians Court? Const. No, Sir; She's Guarded, and secure at Rome; Crispus, not yet acquainted with our Contract, Is sent in show, for I had other purpose, To make his Judgment of my Fausta's Person, Whether to be preserv'd, or like Her Father, To hinder Insurrections, be destroy'd, But hark! What March is this? Perhaps 'tis he! And these his Trumpets, with the Legions Rais'd. Trumpets without. Enter Arius, and Eubolus. Both. Long live the Emperour. Const. Is Crispus come, With those Auxiliar Legions we requir'd; And Money sent to pay the last Arrears? Ari. Nothing obey'd: When first your Orders came, Which by your Brother were in the Forum Read; I never saw so sudden a Revolt. At once they Cry'd, our Liberty's betray'd, Our Courts of Justice Rob'd; Old Rights Infring'd; Our Gods must down, our Shrines and Temples burn: And all for a phantastick, Old Wives Tale; A Cross they Cry'd, one of Silvesters Lies: Which never yet was seen by waking Eyes; But either feign'd, or Dreamt of in the Skies. Const. Is this their Answer to my strict Commands? Ari. Crispus by this return'd, to join your Brother; When straight some Devil whisper'd in their Ears, Your Son already had begun the Change, The Statue of Apollo was pull'd down, To make his Fathers Place: Whereon they cry'd Your Image should be Burnt, and with a breath The Cockle, and the Corn, bow'd all that way. Eub. But were reversed by a more Powerful Gale, Your Brother and your Son, appear'd like Gods, And stopt the Madmen in their full Career. Ari. At close of day, in Dark Cabals they met, And in the Morning gave their Final Answer; Lycinius, who that Night was brought a Captive, To grace the Triumph of your first appearance, Was first propos'd, to share th' Imperial Power: Next they demand a general Persecution Of all the Christians, and Silvesters head. Const. Tell 'em their City shall be Ashes first, Have I for this, with hazard of my Life, So oft Redeem'd em' from their Tyrants Racks, When all their Streets, were but one Hideous Grave; There Wives, and Daughters Ravisht in their View? When Age was drain'd of its last Ebbing drop, When Babes were snatch'd their Earliest breath to give, And dy'd ere knowing what it was to live. TrumpetsâEnter Dalmatius. More TreasonâArius, or do the Slaves Repent? My Brother here. Still to my Arms, and heart, Thou Nerve of all my Wars: How fares my Friend, And my beloved? Dalm. Crispus, our care is well. And the late Tempest which must reach your Ear, By Skilful Pilots, Rockt into a Calm; Believe me Sir, your presence gains the Cause. Therefore upon the Instant march to Rome; Vanquisht Licinius waits to Grace your Triumph. Bless me! Is't possible? Arius with you Sir? Arius the Traitor? Const. Have you found him so? Dalm. The Subtlest Snake, the softest Civil Villain That ever warm'd himself in PrincesâBosom; Diseases, Blasts, Plagues, Death and Hell are in him: What e're his outside seems: This shameless Traitor Was the foul Spring of all these poison'd Waters, That late had like to overflow the Empire; Yet while his Emissaries Fired the People; This Judas on my side, appear'd an Angell: For after the first Mutiny was quel'd; Though he had Sworn to Justifie your Cause, He warn'd the Slaves, I have his hand to show, Next day to make those Impudent demands. Ari. Plots on my Innocence; as I am a Christian, If ere I set my hand to such a Treason, May these rot off, which thus I hold to Heaven: As I am of Priestly Order. Dalm. A Devil Ordain'dâ Sir, if I do not prove him. Const. I believe you, I know him Heretick, a Seditious Traitor, But yet have Reasons to defer his Ruin, Therefore no more at present. Arius hence; And let me hear no further of these Mischiefs. I have pardon'd you; be gone, you Eubulus, and tell the Rebels, I come Embattel'd now for my Revenge; My Standard, and my Banners, bear the Cross Tell 'em Lycinius, whom once before I took to Grace, and Marry'd to my Sister, Their new Petition'd CÃ¦sar soon shall bleed. Silv. Forgive your Enemies. Const. But not my Friends: Lycinius was my Friend, and has betray'd me; Therefore I'le Execute him in their View. Away and warn him, for the Doom that's given. Ex. Arius, Eubulus. 'Tis not by halfs, that we will worship Heaven: No; my Dalmatius, I have made a vow, The Romans, or their Emperour shall bow. They're Subjects, and 'tis fit: Nay, bow they shall: Or CÃ¦sar in th' attempt, their Victim fall; Bow to the Man, whom Heaven Ordain'd for Sway, And in his great Vicegerent learn their Maker to Obeyâ Exeunt. Scene II. ROME. Constantines Palace. Enter Lycinius, Labienas. Labi. The mischief's Ripe, and ready for our wish: Confusion to the House of Constantine, And Fortune points their Fate. For mark the Method The Father sends the Son to see the Prisoner; The Son, not knowing of his Fathers Contract, Appears a God to Fausta's Charming Eyes, And Marry'd her. Lycin. How came you by the Secret? Lab. Arius told me; he who Betrothed the Father Weds the Son, And stands for ever bound to serve Lycinius. Lycin. He's Voted Heretick among the Christians. Labie. No matter what they Vote him, Sir; He's yours, And Foe too all Religion, but his Friends. Lycin. By Mars, he falls the Righter to my purpose. I was my self bred up in Blood and Wars, Untaught, and Scoft at by these Civil Cowards, Wherefore I hate Religion, Arts, and Learning; And if I ever Mount the CÃ¦sars Throne, I'le Raise another General Persecution, Like Nero; But these Christian Dogs to Death; And Build the Temples of the Old Gods again. Labie. And be a God your Self: In the mean time, Let your Wives tears prevail upon your Temper. Supple your Haughty Spirit, bow your Body, Low as the Earth, before the Emperours Feet. Lycin. I had rather dye: If he thinks fit to save me, 'Tis well; if not; why let him take my Head. Labie. Yet for the sake of those, whom you must Govern, Rebate this Martial Fire, and hear your Wife: Hear what return our long'd for Arius brings. Enter Crispus, with Annibal. But soft! the Bridegroom, Crispus and his Friend: Constantia with impatience waits your coming; Constantia, who has Power to save your Head; Though CÃ¦sar with an Oath had Doom'd you Dead. Ex. Lycinius, Labienus. Crispus. How Annibal: What! out of temper now? When Crowns are offer'd, and the CÃ¦sars Purple? What, though not born in the immediate way? Yet thou art Collaterally Great as I. And if I ever Heir this Spacious Empire, By Heaven, thou shalt not share, but guide, engross My hearts best Love, and all the World beside. Anni. Your Heart? Ay there you Eccho'd my desires, Enrich me there, and trowle your empty Globe To those Crown'd Slaves, that know no other Greatness: But tell me, O my Crispus! All Mens Joy; Tell me, and truly from thy Generous Soul, Hast thou a Friend, whom more thou Lov'st then me? Crisp. Not more belov'd, more Fonded then my self, But moreâ Anni. Nay add not, to that broken Truth, There's more in that, no more, then thou had'st Sworn. Crisp. Wilt thou not hear me out? Anni. There needs no more; Thou art no Friend, that Lov'st another more: Nay half so much: But now I find that all The former Flatteries of thy Glozing Friendship, Were Courtiers promises, and Womens Vows, But let me know his Name; Crisp. Thy Father Annibal my Godlike Friend, Dalmatius, who before thou could'st Write Man, Hugg'd Crispus to his Heart: Like Lambs in Peace Together we lay down, together rose, In War like Lyons, Coupled on a side; Ere yet thy Infant Arms, a Sword could Wield, And drove like Herds, the Nations from the Field. Anni. Why then we're Friends agen, more fast then ever, Yet since we have happen'd into this disorder, To make a Tryal of renew'd affection, I'le put thee to the Test. Crisp. Name the Danger, Though Kin to Death, my Arm, Young-man, shall Right thee. Anni. 'Tis death indeed: Most certain Death to me, Unless thy Softning Charms, have power to save me. Crisp. Speak this close grief: That wrings thee with the Anguish, If I am not Eloquent in such a Cause, Cut out my Tongue. Annib. My life is in the hands Of one that hates me; or what wounds me more, Of one, my Crispus, that can never love me. Crisp. Not love thee? O ye Powers! what heart is that? Annib. Hast thou not seen the Beauteous Prisoners? Crisp. Ha! What, Fausta meanst thou? Annib. Fausta and Serena. Crisp. Say which of em'? Which Beauty has Inflam'd thee? Annib. Which shou'd, but the most soft and Artless melter? The Languishingâ Crisp. The killing BeauteousâComeâ Annib. Ha! Crispus thou art Concern'd! Crisp. I am to help theeâ Her Name? Annib. Why take it then, the Fair Serena. Crisp. O She's the softest sweetest, killing Fair By HeavenâI am gladâI'm ravisht that 'tis She! By this Embrace I promise thee success, I know her temper wellâNo more but leave me, I was upon the Instant when I met thee, Going to their Appartment;âNay look upâ And trust thy Friend. Annib. Plead then for my Life, I beg thee as a God to plead my Cause; Thou canst not know o'th' sudden, how 'tis with me: How Great, how Mortal, and how deep the wound. May all the Saints, and Powers that pitty Love, Inspire thy Brest, as if 'twere possible That Annibals Soul cou'd actuate thy body, So sigh, weep, languish, and for Mercy sue, As were I Crispus, I my self wou'd doâ Ex. Annibal. Crisp. The Youth is Haughty, Martial, Hot and Brave; Right for the Field, unhappy parts for Love: Therefore perhaps, the Virgin likes him not. But thou hast luckier Stars: No sooner seen But lik'dâLov'd, Marry'dâHa!âbut where's the Transport? Without thy Fathers knowledge thou wert Marry'd: 'Tis the first Fault of my unhappy youth, Yet 'tis a Faultâbut 'tis the fault of Love. Had he not lov'd Crispus had not been here; Away, you Damps, and darkning Images. Be gone I sayâBehold she comes to meet me; Enter Fausta. Lag as I am, in this great Race of Loveâ O, Fausta, Fausta! Faust. O my Constantine! Crisp. Ha! Faust. A mistake; my fear out-went my Love. Crisp. My Constantine! Thy fearâby Heaven 'twas Ominous: What cause hast thou to fear? Faust. Bondage and Death. Are not those Reasons for a Virgins fear? Crisp. Yes for another, Fausta, not for thine. For Oh! when he has seen and heard like me, The Abstracted Charms of all this Beauteous World, Expect not death, but offers of a Throne. Faust. 'Tis possible: Yet by thy self I swear, By dear lov'd thee, my Crispus in a Cottage Shall be prefer'd to all the Thrones on Earth. Crisp. And thou, forgive me Heaven! I had almost said To Heaven it self: No Fausta, that's the Jar, Religion makes this discord in my Soul. I find it now. Hence come my Starts and fears, Even in the height of my expected joys But Time, the Saints and Miracles must win thee. Faust. No Time, no Miracle, no Saint but thou: Why, thou art all the Wonders of the Earth, My Saint, my hearts Religion, and my Heaven; With thee I am imbarkt to live or Perish, Not only here but in the World hereafter. Crisp. Oh Extacy! Oh pattern for thy Sex: Yet shalt thou Master me by this Subjection Give me thy hand. Thy Lipâthe sweets are Richer, The tast Enobled. Oh! my ravisht Love Glows with the pointed Charms. The Heavens are open'd And I behold thee Crown'd a Saint already. But I will hold thee fast, lest that the Angels snatch thee: Ere we have mingled Soulsâ Faust. Oh not to Night! Crisp. Ha! not to night? Not on this Lov'd Confession? Not when thou hast set my Spirits all on fire? Not now enjoy thee? Thou mak'st my fears return, Far more Extravagant then they were before. Lest e're we join an Apoplex shou'd seize me, The Palace fall, and thousand other Chances, That awe th' Imagination of my Love. Oh Comeâ Faust. I will, and with these longing arms Hold thee till Morn: And from that Morn till Evening: From Evening to Mid-day: From day to Night: From Night to DeathâI'le clap thee thus for ever. Crisp. Let's haste then, while the beckoning Minute smiles. Faust. But I must swear thee first: Crisp. Take Oath on Oath: I swear to obey thee without asking why. Faust. Swear thou wilt never leave thy Wedded Fausta; What ever dreadful Chance, or strange Misfortune, Shou'd start to undo me, almost to a Crime. Crisp. No Crime: But want of Love: Nor that, by Heaven, Shall make me hate thee, though it bring me Death. Oh thou soft Dear! if ever I forsake thee, At my last hour, may I despair of Mercy, And may those Saints, that knew the wrong I did thee, When at Heavens Gate, I beg for Entrance, answer, Remember what thou did'st to Fausta swear, Be gone, for ever leave this happy Sphere; For perjur'd Lovers have no Mansion here.

      <field name="fulltext">The Second Act: Scene ROME. Enter Arius and Labienus, Eubolus. Arius. We have done our Work by halfs; follow'd by the Scent, Trac'd to our Holes! Oh I could play the Mad-man! Men of our Make so poorly hide a Murder, That Dogs can Rake it up. Spies, Spies by Hell! The Course of former Councils was too slow, I am proclaim'd a Traitor, Heretick, And Poniards must proclaim my Accuser nothing. Labie. Were it not better to comply? Arius. Impossible! The Genius of the proud imperial Brothers And mine by Nature Mortally oppos'd. Hate strongly at first sight, which hate improv'd, By the late flaw I found in their Religion: They hear too how I tainted Infant Julian: Yet being made the Emperours Confident, In the late Contract, all might have been retreiv'd; And I at Helm, had not his hated Brother Thus interpos'd to my eternal Ruineâ Poison and Ponyardâ Eubol. Is it come to that? Ari. It is: without dispatch, were are all undone. Oh for a Slave to mould, some Malecontent; His blood adust, and blackned with the blows Of adverse Fortune: yet of Soul elate, And to be flush'd for Fame, or hire To any kind of daring! Lab. Why? Ari. I would work the Melancholy brave To stab Dalmatius. Eubol. Why not Constantine? Ari. Because ten Constantines live at least in him; The one's not half so open to Destruction, As t'other close: and on the Guard to save him; He has unravell'd our close Webb of Thought, And from the bottom of our dark Design Drawn Treason forth, perhaps to hang us all. Lab. 'Tis justly thought; this Lett must be remov'd; And who so fit to hew it into pieces As that ambitious, brawny Fool, Lycinius? Ari. Thou hast hit the Man my busie Brain had lost. The Emperour dooms him dead; by whose Advice? Tell me; I hear the dull Lycinius cry, That e're I fall the Victim of the War, I may at once destroy his Life and Name. Enter Lycinius. Guards: But see he comes! I bring you News. Lycin. Ha! of my Death! I read it in thy Face. Ari. The Emperour, as at first I told your Story, Ready Trumpets, a March at distance. Inclin'd to Mercy: but fierce Dalmatius Repeal'd the hint of your half granted Pardon, And forc'd him to your Death. Call Serena. Lycin. By Mars I'll fight him. Ari. 'Tis not in your Power; You're Pris'ner of War. Lycin. Yet I may curse: My Tongue is not their Prisoner; therefore I'll curse, Bitterly curse Dalmatius: curse 'em all. Ari. Curse for the loss of Empire, and of Life! Bitterly curse! Why Whores will there out-do you. I blush to think the great Lycinius Should e're be brought in such Comparison! Would it not seem more worthy your pact Honour To strike than say? Strike, if I may advise, And e're you suffer.â Lycin. Kill Dalmatius, Constantine, Crispus, Annibal, nay all,â Quite root up all the Imperial Stock at once. Ari. This Dagger then be yours: the Legacy Of an old Prophetess: who dying, told me, He that had Courage to employ it well, And where it ought, should make himself the Greatest.â Trumpet at distance. Lycin. It shall be well employ'd, and where it ought. But hark! th' Emperour comes! Ari. Rather Dalmatius, Perhaps commission'd for your Execution! Lycin. Why then I'll forth and meet him. By the Fates, If I must fall, he shall not live to laugh: And in remembrance of this solemn Oath, I kiss the ominous Gift thou hast bequeath'd me; I'll treasure it next my Heart; where it shall rest, Till sheath'd by Vengeance in Dalmatius Brest. Exit. Ari. Or live or dye, thou art contriv'd for Mischief! Next I must mend the Heresies I've broach'd, And reconcile my self by some bold Offer, With Constantine; which while I undertake, Be it your Care to spread the old poisonous Doctrine: Sow it in all Habits, Persons, Forms, and Places; Grow with the Times, and cultivate Sedition. Enter Serena. My fair Devotess:âbut hence, as I have order'd, And meet me at the Tryal of Lycinius. Ex. Labie. &amp; Eubol. Seren. The Morning's come, and fain I would have rest, Who all the Night have wak'd upon my Pillow, And made it wet with Tears: my solitary Groans That pierc'd Heav'ns Vaults: tho Heav'n was deaf the while; Deaf to redress, have made my Brest so sore That I can sigh no longer. Crispus and Fausta! Oh you happy Lovers! Not so with you the gladsome Minutes past: For, e're 'twas day, I left my tedious Bed, And listen'd to your Joys. Ari. Her Sorrows lull me, And I grow good, I know not how, o'th' sudden. Seren. Such soft Expressions flow'd from the charming Crispus, As did but aggravate my Passion more; Yet hide it, O Serena! though thou diest, Tell it to none, but to the midnight Groves, The Flocks and Streams, and those unhappy Stars, Whose merciless Fires thus fated thy undoing. Ari. What! not to Arius! to thy Confessor; To him who has a Priviledge from Heav'n? Seren. Oh Arius! would I had the Power to hide it; But you have heard it all; And will, perhaps, proclaim a Virgins Frailty. But, Sir, I shall not long survive my shame: And since 'tis known, confess it to the World; Confess, that Passion has dethron'd my Reason, That unbelov'd, I love the best of Men. And sigh unheard, and without Witness mourn, And dote to Death, without the least Return. Ari. 'Tis said, young Annibal is vow'd your Servant. Seren. O Arius! mark the malice of our Fates! That Prince loves me, as Crispus is belov'd, And failing in his Suit, employ'd his Friend To plead his Cause! Oh had it been his own!â But all my Pray'rs, alas! are now in vain, Ready Trumpets for a Call. And wanting Crispus, I must wed my Grave. Therefore I beg you, Sir, procure his Picture To entertain my melancholy Thoughts, Since him himself I ne're must see again. Ari. That, and all Helps which Arius can command. Seren. I thank you Sir, by the blest Saints I do; I thank you for this Favour, from my Heart. But hark! they come: Crispus and Fausta come! Oh Heart! why dost thou leap against my Bosom Like a cag'd Bird, and beat thy self to Death For an impossible Freedom? Ari. Stay to salute 'em. Seren. No Arius, no: I cannot, dare not stand 'em: But see, they come, wreath'd in each others Arms, And mingling Kisses. Has not then the Night Been long enough, but you most love by Day? Do Fausta, do, be stifled with the Joy. Follow him from thy Chamber to the Grove, To Garden haunts, and clasp him in the Bowers, Thence to your golden Beds again, while I Sink to my Grave, and there forgotten, lye. Exit. Serena. Ari. Crispus to court Serena for his Friend, His Picture she shall have itâMischief, Hell! And if it be thy Will thy Slave obeys. Crispus and Annibal, that late were Friendsâ Shall strait be foes. But hush, the Lovers comeâ This Closet hides me to discover more. Enter Crispus and Fausta. This Closet be my School, to learn their Language. Fausta. Your Fathers Trumpets call you. Let 'em call, You shall not go. Oh are there any Sounds To charm, more powerful than your Fausta's Cries? Crisp. No, not the Tongues of Angels! O best Joy Of my abounding Soul! What shall I call thee? By Heav'n, thou art all Heav'n, all Paradise. Talk not then of going from thee: for, I'll stay till Age Has snow'd a hundred Winters on my Head, Yet give and take Enjoyments then, as now. Faust. And oh, for thee, thou dearest of the World, My Souls best Life, and my Hearts grasp'd Desire, Oh what Return! The Mother on her throws, After the Rack when hanging o're her Babe, With bleeding Joys, wild Looks, and earning Smiles, Loves not her Darling more than I love Crispus. Thou shalt not leave me, Crispus. Crisp. Yes, to meet again; Our Loves approv'd, by him that gave me Being, And thenâ Faust. What then? He dooms me to that place; Where in his Shrowd the poor Maximian lies, Where I shall lye as I had never been, Nor think of Crispus more.â Crisp. Canst thou fear Death, While I have Life? Faust. Oh do not trust thy Father! Trust not the Passions of a Conquerour; For in his fatal Look, when last he left me, Something I saw, that bid me fly his Presence. Fly to the Verge of Earth, and leap the bounds, Rather than ever meet his Eyes again. Crisp. Thy Father's Fate makes thee mistrust thy own. Faust. No Crispus, not Mistrust, but certain Danger; Which like a moulding Promontory hangs, Bursting above our Heads; and threatens Death, Unless we House betimes, and scape the fall. Crisp. What danger? Death? What fall? Faust. Thy Father. Crisp. Ha! Faust. Thy Father, Crispus. Crisp. Knows not we are marry'd, But shall, and will I hope forgive my passion. Faust. I dream't last night, thy Father was in love; In love with me, my Crispus; catch'd us clasp'd. And with his Dagger, stabb'd us in the fold; Crisp. Is't possible? Faust. Most true. Crisp. And catch't thee with me? Faust. Catch't us in bed. Crisp. There? Faust. Here. Why dost thou wonder? 'Twas but a dream. Crisp. Yet there is wonder in 't. Because, by Heav'n, I dreamt the very same Is it not strange? Faust. If it should happen true! Crisp. That would be strange indeed. Faust. Therefore let's fear the worst: and Arm against it; For oh, Why should I hide a secret from thee? When I beheld him last, He languished, And wrung my hand at parting. Crisp. But what said he? Faust. I will not tell you Crispus, till you answer What you would do with me, my dearest Joy, If it were true indeed, your Father lov'd me. Crisp. What, at your parting? ha! Faust. Why if't were true, Would you forsake me? Crisp. Be my own murderer! I know not what, but speak your parting. Oh! Faust. Why are you so enrag'd? I dare not tell you. Crisp. If ought thou hid'st, by Heav'n thou dost not love me. Faust. By Heav'n! I hope no other Heav'n, but thee. What if he talkt alittle? Age will talk, And think of it no more. Trumpets ready for a Call. Crisp. What was your talk? I'le know each syllable. Faust. Why so you shall: But then be calm; What if he talk't of love? And what? Oh be not angry, and I'll tell you, What if to save my life I promis'd him?â Crisp. Ha! promis'd Fausta? Promise the Father and engage the Son? But speak, I stand upon a Precipice; For if 'tis true, that e're so little past Of love beforeâ Faust. What then? Crisp. And thou hast promis'd? Faust. Suppose I have Sworn. Crisp. Suppose then thy dishonour: Suppose me never to behold thee more; Suppose my death; both Soul and Bodies ruin. Faust. Suppose no more, but what my Soul hath Sworn, To love his Son, none but the lovely Crispus; O therefore clear thy brow, and take me to thee, Be still my love, forgive this little fault, And jealousie shall ne're offend thee more. Crisp. O Charmer! Beauty, What! where was the need? Why hast thou kept me on the Rack so long? Tho taken down, I feel the strains upon me, And shall, I fear, too long. But hark, they call, Trumpets. And I must go. Faust. But will you then return? Crisp. Quick as thy wishes, or my own desires; But make no more such Tryal. Hark again. Trumpets again. Faust. I cannot part with you, tho for a moment. Crisp. I'll but enquire whether my Father's come. Faust. Swear to come back then, Swear before you see him, To give me one look more. Crisp. What needs an Oath? Before I speak with himâ Faust. You'l speak with me, For I have much to say of mighty moment; Swear therefore to return. Crisp. Swear on thy Lips; Thus with my Heart I seal my Vows for ever. Ex. Crispus. Faust. Heart and the Holiest Vows deep writ in Blood; Blood and dishonor: Take then, take my cause; Thou, that hast made me sin, O mighty love! And let thy Mother plead it with her Tears, He sees his Father, and my crime at once; And then resolves never to see me more. Enter Arius. Call Dalmatius, Crispus, all Attendants. Arius. What then? Faust. What then! O Arius, Dost thou know me? And ask what then, when he ne're sees me more? I'll tell the then, I'll never see the day Shades, Night and Death, Despair and Dungeons hold me, When those dear Eyes shall never light me more. Arius. Since you enjoy'd him, let the Tides of love Be swallow'd in the Ocean of Ambition. Faust. Ambition, Pomp, and greatness of the World, All empty sounds to love! But thine's a downward sense, Thou hast no tast of these sublimer joys. But haste! look out; Why comes he not again? He swore, he would; but he has seen his Father! Who stops him, with my first unhappy Contract. Arius. I see him yonder. Faust. Blessings on thy Tongue; But I'll run forth to meet him, and no longer, Conceal the Innocent deceit of Love. Arius. Hold Madam, stay, Dalmatius comes; retire, Faust. Dalmatius! Let me see my self. Arius. They come. Faust. Dalmatius! Gods, 'tis He, He tells him all; Th' Emperor told it him. Nay sir must out, I am lost, undone: But gentle Arius, wait, And watch, and bring me word, how Crispus bears it. Oh that I were a Spirit to stand unseen! To mark his passions how they rise and fall, With every Glance of those dear, dreadful Eyes: But see they come, and yet I cannot stir, I grow distracted with my hope and fear, Compell'd to go; yet long to tarry here. Ex. Fausta. Enter Dalmatius and Crispus to Arius. Dalm. I have much against you, Crispus; and you know it; Therefore with all the freedom of a friend, Tell me what is the cause, you have not been So free as formerly. Crisp. You know I am. Dalm. I'll press you Sir, no more, only remember, There stands a Villain, whom I have seen you whisper, Ex. Arius. Crisp. I'll tell you all. Dalm. You dare not: Come there is a guilt at bottom, You blush to own, a Crime of such a nature, As will admit no Pardon. Thou hast sin'd Against the great Divinity of friendship; Which my Soul takes to death. Crisp. Can it be Ever too late to gain a Pardon here? Dalm. I cannot tell; Yet I can tell thee this, There was a time, not many days are past, Since I preferr'd thy friendship to the World; When I cou'd say; Why yonder goes the Man, Whom my Soul worships more then Constantine, And Loves beyond my Son. By Heav'n thy fault Is ominous, and grinds my temper through. Crisp. That Son you nam'd unhappily 's in Love. Dalm. Then He's a Fool. With whom? Crisp. Maximians Daughter; The younger Beauty. Dalm. Ha! And you Love the Elder: My life on't some such masterly design; This makes you shun the Camp, to lurk beneath The Eeves of Palaces, and droop in Corners. But Sir your Pardon. I almost forgot To urge your swiftest speed, to wait your Father. Crisp. I will but take my leave. Dalm. I fear there is Too much already taken; but no moreâ If you have ought to say, I'll visit for you.â Crisp. Be all as you would have it! Oh your hand! Nay, I will force my Entrance to your Heart, By opening all my own; and so farewell. Ex. Crispus. Dalm. I blame my friend for walking in the Dark, Yet hide my self, who when I seem most strange Am fondest of his Love. So Sir, What now? Enter Anniball. Annib. The fair Constantia with condemn'd Lycinius, Drest in the saddest Glass of dying sorrow, Was coming to entreat you for his Pardon; But soon as she had heard from weeping Arius, Her Husbands doom, she in our Arms Expir'd. Dalm. I mourn her Fate; But for Lycinius, I urg'd at first, and still resolve, his Death Is necessary to the Emperors life Nor should a few weak drops by Women shed, Stop a Decree so Absolute and Royal. Annib. He comes attended with a mournful crowd, To sue for life. Dalm. I'll have him Executed in their view; Yes Anniball, and shew thy Youth a pattern Of the old Romans, for thy imitation: Who hast but poorly Copy'd from thy Father. Annib. Why Sir? What Villain has traduc'd my Vertue? Dalm. No Villain, but thy Prince has own'd thy weakness; And says thou Lov'st a Captive Foe of Rome. Annib. The Virgin's beautiful, and greatly born. Dalm. Perhaps the Virgin may as greatly die, And yield her Beauties to the Fatal stroke. Annib. To the Fatal stroke! Oh all ye Powers! No Sir: the fair Serena shall not die While I wear this. Dalm. Ha Rebel! Traytor! How! Not at the Emperors Doom? Annib. No nor at yours, That gave me Sir my being; take it again, Unless you give me leave to lay it there, Where I have plac'd my Love. Dalm. The Emperor Decrees thee Cappadocia: Wilt thou forfeit The noble Heritage of such Ambition For Infamous Love? Annib. Wrong not a Passion, That equals your own Virtue. For could CÃ¦sar Give with a Daughter of his own the World, I would prefer my Love in this Condition, To all the proffers of his Blood and Empire. Dalm. Hence from my sight; And till thou break'st this passion, See me no more. Annib. Then I must never see you. For when I cease to Love, where I have vow'd, I am no more: Therefore upon my Knees, I beg you to recall this dreadful sentence. Repeal my Banishment, and give me leave, To win the Heart of this unhappy Maid, Or bid me die before you. Dalm. Rise my Boy: Thou Lov'st indeed, who canst refuse a Kingdom. Enter Arius, Lycinius, Labienus, Eubolus, with the Populace. But see Lycinius with his followers here, Take to the habit of thy former Wars; And soften not my Justice by thy sorrows. Annib. I have heard Lycinius lately threatned you, Therefore your Guardians Eye be watchful o're you. Dalm. Fear not, I'm Arm'd against 'em. Know, Lycinius, The Emperor has decreed to shew his Subjects, What weary'd Mercy dares resolve to do. Cleanthes; you the Captain of the Guard: Lead to the Forum, and in the Peoples view Strike off his Head. Lycin. âI bear the sentence as becomes my Honour: And all the favour which I beg in Death, Is to reveal a secret to your Ear, Which may import the Emperors life, and Yours. Dalm. What would you Sir? Lycin. My Lord, Are you in earnest? Or is there room for hope? Dalm. Sir, be not flatter'd: Hope is the fawning Traytor of the mind, Which while it cozen's with a colour'd friendship, Robs us of our last Vertue, Resolution. Lycin. Speak then the force of ResolutionâThus. Annib. No VillainâThus. Annibal disarms and offers to Stab him. Dalm. Hold, Annibal! Hold thy Hand. An executioner in the best of Causes, Is a vile trade for Honourable men; Therefore let slaves dispatch him. Annib. Rack him First, To know who counsel'd him to this damn'd deed? Dalm. No: To Sylvester let him own his fault, And die a Christian, I am satisfy'd. Lycin. Ha ha!âA Christian! What and fall a Sheep? Confess! No, as he urg'd, bring forth the Rack: Wire-draw my Limbs, Spin all my Nerves like Hairs, And work my tortured Flesh as thin as Flame, You shall not know a title more then this; I was set on to stab Dalmatius; And would the Emperor, were he in my reach. Who were the Gods that prompted thus my Arm, You Christian Curs shall never know from me? Therefore go learn the Mystery in Hell. Thus much I may acquaint you; They are living, Warm in your Bosoms, and I hope will sting you; Sting you to Death. Plagues, Famine, Sword, and Fire; Fire from the Gods on your proud City fall; And with that dying Curse I leave you all. Ex. Guarded. Dalm. His Fate was just; now Romans to the Triumph; Go forth and meet your Emperor, whose mercy Extends her peaceful Wings to all that seek him; And is the Darling attribute of his Soul. But hark! He comes! The Saviour of your Empire; Bring forth his Statues; Crown his Images; Meet him with Garlands, Songs and Shouts of Triumph. But see his entrance is already made, And there He comes, with Crispus in his Arms. Enter Constantine, Crispus, &amp;c. To the Triumph. Const. Dalmatius, I must thank thee for the Fate, Of that too stubborn troubler of our Reign; Sylvester to his Hermitage retires, And says the Saints are sad at my delay: Tell him, e're long, and urge him to return, The Emperor and the Court shall be Baptiz'd. Dalm. Take to your former freedom, Mirth and Humor, For 'tis observ'd, you are not as you were. Const. Oh Brother! Friend! In all my hazards try'd, This Son shall share the Heart and Empire too, Of my lov'd Crispus, whom for some few minutes, I would discourse alone. Dalm. Your wishes on you; Peace to your thoughts, and Heaven still guide your Councils. Exeunt. Manent Constantine, Crispus. Const. Hast thou perform'd thy Embassy, my Crispus? And seen the Daughter of Maximian? Crisp. I have seen Her Sir; And seen Her Beauteous Sister. Const. How lik'st thou? Ha! Are they not charming both? Both Beautiful? Crisp. They are. But why Sir both? Const. Because the latter only Catch'd thy praise, When Fausta in the Pride of blooming Nature, As much transcends her as the Summers Rose The little Beauties of a backward Spring. Crisp. 'Tis true, She is the Elder. Const. And the fairer, In all comparisons to be prefer'd, Not only to her Sister, but the World. Crisp. Is't possible? Const. That thou should'st be so dull, To ask the Question, having seen the wonder! Crisp. But Sir, when I was sent you talk't of Death. Const. Death to my self, and thee, and all mankind, Rather then wound a part of my Lov'd Fausta. Crisp. Oh Heav'n! What said you? Do you Love her then? Const. Love her my Son! In Age I Love her more, Then in my Youth I Lov'd the chace of Glory. Crisp. And does she know you Love her? Const. Know? Approves; Approving joyn'd, and Seal'd the Contract sure. Crisp. Death and Despair! Approv'd, Joyn'd, Seal'd, Contracted! How Seal'd? And how Contracted? Const. Why our Lips Have Sign'd and Seal'd an Everlasting Love. Crisp. What, kiss'd her? Ha! But I'm too Credulous: All you have said is but to try my temper, How much your Son can bear. Const. I must confess, Thy fears were just, had'st thou another Father; But as I am, I swear what ever Issue I have by Fausta, Thou shalt Heir my Power. Crisp. Talk not of Power, but tell me of your Love; Distract me not with these Ambiguous Answers, But tell me; Swear to save my loss of reason, If as you Love, you are by Fausta Lov'd. Const. That I Love Fausta; is as true by Heav'n, As I Love thee; But whether I am Lov'd, With just return, is hard indeed to swear: Yet as I said before, our Hands have joyn'd, Our Lips have seal'd, and binding Oaths have past. Crisp. What Oaths? Const. Betrothing Oaths. Crisp. Oh, All ye Saints! Are you contracted too? Const. Ay Crispus, we're contracted; Weep not my Son; I swear by this Embrace, Thou shalt not less be Lov'd then heretofore. Crisp. Betroth'd! Oh Heav'n! And have you Sir enjoy'd her? Const. No Crispus; That's a Heav'n I have to come. Crisp. A Hell! All Hell! And if not yet enjoy'd, Let me conjure you by my Mothers ashes, Touch her not for the World. Const. What means my Son? I have decreed to marry her this Night; And tast the sweets of long expected joys. Crisp. By Heav'n I swear those sweets have poison in 'em, Bane to your Soul, your Empire, Life and Glory. Const. Take heed my Crispus, that thou do not wrong her; I know the hazard of Succession frights thee. Crisp. No: By your sacred life; nothing but Honour Provokes me in the point: She's false, forsworn, And to my certain knowledg loves another. Oh! Therefore touch her not; and to convince you, That Empire could not work me thus: This night I'll turn a Hermit, and renounce the World. Const. If she be false: I know his temper well; And nature cannot make such faults o'th' sudden, If she be false! By Heav'n, thou hast moved me Crispus: But speak the Traitors name, who thus has wrong'd me. Crisp. Pardon me, Sir, his name; He could not wrong you, Because he knew not. Const. What? Crisp. Your Love. Const. His name, There's more in this; His name, again I charge thee, Not only name him, but produce his person; Or I shall think all forgery thou hast sworn. Crisp. O let me beg you, wed her not to night, And when I see you next, I'll tell you more; Perhaps betray the Innocent to Death. Const. Let that be prov'd; I swear he shall not die, Thou art it seems his friend as well as mine; But look you calm the Tempest you have rais'd, Or I will make thee stranger to my Soul. Ex. Constantine. Crisp. Solus. I am content; if that some pittying Power, Would make make me too a stranger to my self: But hold my Heart a while, till I have found her. Yet there's a lucid joy in these distractions; To know he has not bedded her; then had follow'd, Her death and mine, and consequent Damnation: Yet lest she should consent, I'll haste, and warn her; When warn'd I'll watch, and if she after Yield, Through Love or Fear, to his Incestuous charms, I'll rush through all and stabb her in his Arms. Exit. End 2d. Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Third Act: Scene 1st. Enter Annibal and Serena. Annib. Is this your Answer then, You cannot love me? This the Reward for Offers of my Blood? And braving a stern Father to preserve you? This the Effect of Crispus Eloquence! To make his Friend a most untimely Grave? For, bear it as you please, or laugh or grieve, I will not be a Trouble to you long. Seren. What shall I say? Alas! I might delude you, Annibal, Like other faithless Beauties of the Age; But the Gods fram'd me of so plain a Temper, I cannot hide my Thoughts, Though to my undoing. But something more there is, if you could bear it, To turn your desp'rate Love for ever from me. Annib. Produce it then; for, what can Nature shew me Than Death more dreadful, wilder than Despair, Which now are my Familiars? Seren. Take it, Sir, The only Secret of my wounded Soul. I love, I languish, and despair like you. Annib. What, do you love another? Seren. Love him to death, nor does he know I love him; Or if he did, he would not make Return. Annib. Can this be possible! But where, where is he? That I may rush with all my Rage upon him, And bear him with me, to the other World. Seren. Not for a thousand Worlds you must not hate him Annib. Plagues! Curses on his Head, Rage and Despair Is this then the Return of all my Vows, To make my setting yet more deep in Blood? But give me quick his Quality and Name. Seren. His Name! what, after such Resolves of Vengeance! Your Fate and mine should not compell it now. Annib. What, not to save my Life! Seren. No: for what Life can stand in Competition, When his is threaten'd? Better you, and I, And all the rest of humane Kind, should perish, Than he, the Master-piece of Nature, suffer. And should you know him, spite of your Resolves, Sir, you would kneel and worship too like me. Annib. Show me the God then, if I must adore. Seren. No, since you have sworn, I should do ill to trust you: Yet, for his Preservation, I must tell you, When e're he dies Serena too shall bleed. From the same hand, the same Dispatch I crave, And, if at last one Monument we have, What Joys can Life compare with such a Grave! Exit. Enter Arius with Crispus Picture. Annib. Death, Hell, and Furies; if my Sword have Charms, Which never fail'd me yet, I'll find him out; This Rival Godâ And drive him from the World. Ari. Ha! Goes it there? Then to my Task! Annib. Arius in Contemplation! 'Twere worth my while to spy; Crispus Picture! Forgive me Arius, if I rob your Hand Of what's so deep ingraven in my Heart. For whom this pretty Present? Ari. Your PardonâThe Mystery is one of Loves great Secrets. Annib. Crispus in Love, and hide it from his Friend! From Annibal, that open'd all to him! 'Twas much unkind: Arius I am concern'd: And you must tell me where his Heart's engag'd, E're I return the Picture. Arius. Sir, I am in haste; And dare not tell her Name; therefore I beg you: She waits my coming.âGood my Lord,âshe loves To that degree, each Moments Stay is Death: Therefore, let me conjure you. Annib. Thou dost but raise my Admiration more: Therefore, your Business, or farewel.â Arius. Stay, Stay! My Lord, you are his Friend! yet 'tis a Breach Of Trust: but since there is no other help, And the fair Mistress of his Heart may pine To death upon the loss; restore the Picture, And take the Secret, Sir: her Name's Serena. Annib. Traitor, thou ly'st: and, but thy Robe protects thee, Should'st feel, even now, th' Effects of my Revenge. Ari. To clear th' Aspersion, bear it Sir, your self, And to Serena's Face, I'll justifie The Secret of her Love; tho Crispus kill me. Annib. By Heav'n, thou dost recall a dreadful Image: Of late I met him e're I made my Visit To her thou hast nam'd, and ask'd him of my Love! He seem'd in haste! his Answers were abrupt; His Count'nance sad: and thus in short return'd; Hunt not the Bubble Beauty, like a Boy; Fall like a Man: and let your Rest be Fame. And so it shall: If what thou say'st be true, I'll level him with Earth. Arius. What said you, Sir? Annib. Yet I will have more Proof; she shall, her self, Be witness to the Fall of this high Virtue: Then Friendship to the Winds, like meeting Tides, We'll fight the Tempest out, nor give it o're, Till one lies dash't, and broken on the Shore. Exit. Ari. Thus far the Devil is the best mounted yet, And Heresie at last shall win the Race. Enter Labienus and Eubolus. Ha! Labienus here, And my Eubolus; We shall shortly govern. Labi. I met the Emperour of late, alone; Who ask'd for you. Ari. I'll instantly attend him. Where is his Son? Eubol. I left him with Dalmatius. Ari. Unloading his sick Heart upon his Friend. Enter Dalmatius and Crispus. But see, the Master Enemy's at hand; Sculk to your Posts, and dive in Mists away. Ex. Ari. Lab. Eub. Crisp. Now my Dalmatius, now thou hast my Heart, And make good use on't, if I ne're see thee more. By Heav'n, my Friend, I have not hid a Point Of that sad Story that must make my Ruine. Dalm. Would thou hadst told me half of it before! I might have sav'd thee many a Sigh and Tear: Pray Heav'n no worse come on't; but 'tis no time T' upbraid thee now; What wou'dst thou have me do? Crisp. Perswade my Father from enjoying her, For if that be to night, as once he vow'd, Thou shalt behold thy Crispus dead to morrow. Dalm. And what of Fausta? Crisp. I know not what. That subtle, false one, that has thus deceiv'd me, And with her charms ensnar'd my innocent Soul: But I will hence. Dalm. For what? Crisp. To execute The Vows I made. Dalm. Go then and kill her. Crisp. Ha! Dalm. Kill th' Adulteress: This incestuous Charmer: And have her born in Triumph to thy Father: Then tell thy Tragick story like a Man; And greatly thus Atone for both your Crimes. Crisp. Farewell: I'll find another way to end her. Dalm. Tongueâkill her, go: or swear and be forsworn, Thou ne're wilt see her more. Heav'n! That a Man Born to the Empire of the World, should dote On such slight stuff as Woman! Crisp. See my Father, Look thou to Him, as I'll be guard on Her. Incest! Dishonour! To all future Agesâ Think,âThink on thatâand push him from his ruine. Ex. Crispus. Enter Constantine, Sylvester, Dalmatius. Const. What say the People to the rumour spred Of my new Contract? Sylv. All the Christians mourn, And sicken in their Souls, as if Heav'n warn'd The Earth, of some unheard Calamity: The Heathens on the other side rejoice, And cry, a Persecution is at hand. Const. No matter to the point; Knowst thou the man, Whom Fausta Loves? Sylv. I told you Sir before, I would be dumb for ever on this Theam. Const. Yet this implies thou knowst, but wilt not show him: All know him, all, all but he that shou'd; For Crispus has confess'd, Yet hides the name;âBut I'll find out one, Less meriting respect, whom Racks shall force. Dalm. If you intend your Empires safety, Sir, Cast Fausta from your Bosom; Turn her out; Away with herâfar let her be Exil'd, With all her race; For Death is in her Beauty. Const. My Brother offer this! Death in her Beauty? Dalm. Violent, sudden Death; Death to your Health, and Ruine to your Glory. Const. Perhaps he is the man. Her Lover! Yes: And thus conceals his flame with Covert rage, For else what Cause could thus provoke his Passion? What is the Publick Interest here concern'd? Their murmurings, or their joys; which with a nod, My Power can hush. By Heav'n there's more at bottom, And I will find it out; Their looks betray e'm: Priest: Princes: all engag'd; and for some great one. Enter Arius. But holdâhere comes my Man! Brother I've thought And will consider further what you urg'd, Against my Wife. Dalm. We leave you to Heav'ns care, And wish you to beware that waiting Fiend. Ex. Dalm. Sylv. Const. So, now your business, Arius! Arius. Sir. Const. Your business? The Coast is clear; be your Confession so; And speak what all the Court have sworn to hide. Arius. Sir, Labienus gave me your Commands, That I shou'd wait. Const. Dost thou dally with me? Thou knowst the least of thy Enormous Crimes Deserve a lengthen'd death: Think on thy Treason, Atheism, Blasphemies against the Highest; Think on the purpos'd murther of my Brother, Wrought by thy Charms, thou damn'd one; after this, Let thy affrighted Soul despise my wrath, And if she dares be dumb to my demands. Arius. What must I Answer? Const. Give me Truth for Truth. Once more then; And this warning be thy last, Show me the robber of my hearts repose, Friend to my Crispus, but his Fathers Foe; The Conquering Rival of my ravish't Love. Arius. What, has your Son reveal'd? Const. He says she's false; but tells me not to whom; Swears she's foresworn: And when I see him next, I shall know more. Arius. What if you never see him? Const. Why dost thou start a Question so unlikely? Arius. I cannot think he will betray his Friend; He who betrays his friend, betrays himself; And rather than do that, I judge he'll leave your sight, The Empire, and his Love for ever. Const. Love, Arius! Ha! His Love! What Love? To whom? Arius. Why Love to you: What other Love shou'd Crispus entertain? He has no Mistress sure! Const. Thou seem'st to hint, As if he had: Mark thy foregoing words: He who betrays his friend, betrays himself: By Heav'n! Thou hast set my anxious Soul a' work. For when thou saidst; he has no Mistress, sureâ Thy meaning was, to make me think he had; And that this Mistress could be none but Fausta. Arius. I hope, dread Sir, you will not wrest my words, And Innocent thoughts to any evil purpose. Const. What! at your tricks agen? Be quick my Traitor, And spread it once thy double Heart before me; Dost thou not judge my Son, his Father's Rival? Arius. If you would know my Heart, indeed, I do. Const. Why, what a Devil wert thou then to deny't? So pittifully play the Hypocrite; And serue that lying Face into a show Of Innocence, When nature stampt thee for a Villain! Arius. Forgive me, Sir, if I avow 'twas fear, Not Villany that made me hide my thought. Const. All fear, but fear of Heav'n, betray's a guilt; And guilt is Villany. But let thy fear Produce what past betwixt the wicked pair; Show me th' Adulteress and Adulterer; Where, how and when, this Incest was Committed, Who was the Instrument and Cursed Bawd, And damn'd contriver of their horrid joys. Arius. Oh Heav'n! Const. O Hell! For there shalt thou be hurl'd, And rost in Sulphur, if Thou not tell me all; Thou, who perhaps thy self wer't the Contriver, The Bawd I nam'd, and Instrument of their lust. Arius. Hold Sir! And I'll confess: I've seen your Son Oftner then I have wish'd, attend your Fausta, And seen him late from her Apartment come; I've heard him praise her long, and when the praise Was finish'd, sigh, that he durst praise no longer: At least I thought so, but my thought 's no proof. Const. No Arius, not enough for Crispus Death, But there's enough to turn my Spirit from him, To make me loath his form; When next we meet, From Head to Foot to measure him with my Eye, Both as an Object of my scorn and hate. Arius. That Love has past betwixt 'em is past doubt, But for enjoyingâ Const. Knowst thou ought of that? Arius. Not I, by Heav'n! Const. Why didst thou start it then? Arius. Sir to be satisfi'd, what you wou'd do, Upon the demonstration. Const. Both shou'd bleed, Both dye, as sure as we are living, Arius; For him, 'twere sacriledge to think to save him, If thus he has transgress't, not then my vows, Not all the Conquests of his blooming Years, With my whole Empires Knees and lifted Hands: Not the remembrance of his Mothers Tears, When on her death-bed, she bequeathed his safety To my best Care and Love, shall once redeem him. Arius. What shall be done to him that finds the truth? Const. Reward and Honour. He shall be my friend. Arius. I ask no more; henceforth I'm yours; To search, tho at the Peril of my life The bottom of this business. Const. Say and doâ But send my Wardrobe now, to Fausta's side, Bear her the Diadem, with stile of Empress: And say this night I bed Her. Arius. That will prove herâ If she refuse; You know Sir what to judge. Nor would it be amiss to break discourse, About your Son, and sift her subtle Soul.â Const. I apprehend thee: But as I commandedâ AwayâOh Constantine! Yet e're this search, Whatever comes, Remember he's thy Son; Son of thy Love, and once was next thy Soul. But as the best are worst, when once corrupted, If he has sinn'd at all, he has sinn'd to Death; The Thought distracts me; Heav'n remove this Trouble, Or I shall run to my old Gods again. But hush awhile: I'll bear my Passion cold, I'll curb it while the Reins of Reason hold; But if they break, then Nature, where's thy Call? Be deaf to Reason, Nature, Judgment, Allâ The Precipice is Fate; and if we roul, The Fault is theirs that fool'd us with a Soul. Exit. Scene II. Enter Crispus with a Dagger, and Fausta. Faust. Hold, hold thy handâ Crisp. Think not I meant to kill Theeâ No, thou seducer, were thy Stains more deep Think not too, Despair, and Rage cou'd so unman me To hurt a Woman. Yet thou shalt hear me Fausta: And if the Story of thy Crimes can kill thee, I'll lay thy Wounds wide open to the Air; Display the Perjuries of thy bleeding Heart, And to thy Incest, add at last a Murder. Faust. Stab with thy Dagger then; but let thy Tongue Destroy no more. Crisp. Oh all ye Powers, who that had known last Night, The Joys which I have known, could once have thought it! Who that had heard her Vows, when on my Breast, Weary'd with Oaths, and out of Breath with Kisses She panting swore! And wish'd Destruction seize her, If she were not content, so one night more Her ravish'd Soul like that might entertain, To live her Miseries and past Life again. Faust. By all those Powers you name, and by your own, I wish so still. Crisp. Yet at that very Minute When thus she swore, to know she was forsworn, Conscious her Faith was plighted to another! And who that other pick'd from all Mankind, To make her more abhor'd, but my own Father? Faust. What, Load on Load? Crisp. Her violated Hands Were plighted fast with his; and Kisses past.â Faust. Hold, hold, and let my Tears atone, my Lord, Or sink upon the Earth. Crisp. The Center, Fausta, The Center cannot hide thee from the Horrors Of thy own Conscience, which are my Avengers: And wheresoe're thou fly'st, shall follow thee With inward Hells, for the base Wrong thou hast done me. Faust. O Crispus! never, never, wilt thou end? Crisp. By Heav'n! I know thy damnable Design: Thou hast this Night contriv'd to ruine Nature, To make the Angels sick with such a Crime, As equals hers that first betray'd the World. Faust. I'll stop thee with my Kisses! Crisp. Off Crocodile! Faust. Why use thy Ponyard then. Crisp. Nor that, nor this. I had design'd, 'tis true, to stab my self; But second Thoughts instruct me thus to haunt thee; Like an eternal Fiend to follow thee: To hollow still Damnation in thy Ear, And hinder thee from Incest with my Father. Oh horrid Thought! Faust. Oh horrid Thought indeed! Crisp. Why does it not possess thee! Thou fair insinuating Snake! wouldst thou then guild thy Poison? Swear on my Ponyard, swear, and damn thy self; Thou hast not plotted, as this Night, to twist Thy incestuous Arms about my Father's Neck! Faust. Yes, I will swear. But let me lean my Head Against thy Breast, while I recover Breath: For I am faint with Groans. Crisp. Oh Heart! Oh Love! She grasps so hard, and locks so with her Charms, I cannot put her from me! Fausta! is't possible! Is it then possible! Thou canst be good? So good at least, as being thus gone in Sin, To go no further? Faust. Let me swear; For I will face the Gods in such a Cause; And standing on the Guard of Innocence, Swear, all I've done was but th' Effect of Love. Crisp. Again thou'rt fallen; for thou art guilty, Fausta, Of Impious Treasons, and incestuous Love. Faust. I am not, Crispus. Crisp. Ha! not guilty, Fausta? Then farewel all. Faust. Hold, hold, not guilty to my Crispus. Fall not to Rage again, and I'll confess I was compell'd to be contracted to him: Not wedded, nor possest. Crisp. Why didst thou hide thy Contract? Faust. Because 'twas forc'd by Fear; nor did I dare Reveal it to thee, e're I had thee sure. So much I lov'd thee, Crispus. Crisp. But what hadst thou decreed to do to night, This fatal Night, if that the Emperour Had sworn to enjoy thee? Faust. Stop him with my Tears; Or if they fail'd, to dam his Passion thus, And sheath this hidden Ponyard in my Heart. Crisp. Is't possible, Thou should'st so greatly dare? Faust. Yes Crispus. Thou shalt see by what's to come. Oh! therefore take me to thy Breast, and swearâ Crisp. Swear first thy self, he never shall possess thee. Faust. What needs an Oath after possessing Thee? Crisp. Yet, for the Satisfaction of my Soul, And Cement of our everlasting Loves, Swear thou wilt never. Faust. Never Crispus, never. By Heav'n and Earth, by all that's great, and holy, I swear thy Father never shall embrace me. Crisp. What never! Oh yet closer! Never Fausta? Faust. By all this Dearness, never Crispus, never. Enter Arius. Arius. What Faults are gone and past, it matters not: But you had best beware of what's to comeâ Haste Sir away.âSee there the Beds prepar'dâ Scene draws, The Diadem; and Name of Empress givenâ Your Father's at my Heels! hark! you are warn'd. Soft Musick. I hear him come, and wish you Sir away. Ex. Arius. Crisp. Oh Fausta! Faust. Take no Thought. Crisp. If he should charm thee, Or scare thee to Complianceâ Faust. That distrust Again! by Heav'n I'll dye before he enters. Crisp. Hold thee, my Heart! my Life, my Love, my Soul, I'll stayâand hazard allâbut hark! he comes. I would adviseâLive, if thou canst with Honourâ If notâhe's here, fall, and I'll follow thee. Ex. Crispus. Re-enter Arius with Constantine. Const. Ha Arius! see'st thou there? Ari. Crispus, I think. Const. Did'st thou not see him? Ari. Yes. Const. Why dost thou then suppose it but thy Thought? Ari. Because I do not like his being here. Const. Nor I, by Heav'n! Withdraw; and wait my Call. Ar. retires. What now, my Fausta! Ha! in Tears my Fair! What, on thy Wedding Night? Why dost thou fly me? Am I a Ravisher? Howe're reputed Bloody in Fields, in Chambers I am gentle As thy own Thoughts. Therefore let our Vows be scal'd, and then to bed. Faust. What said you, Sir? Const. Why, to Bed my Love; And hide thy Virgin Fears. Thou wilt be bolder thereâ Faust. Alas! I dare not. Const. Why? Faust. I've sworn, my Lord. Const. What, and to whom? Faust. To Heav'n I've sworn, Howe're contracted, that I will not wed you. Const. When? Faust. Not to night. Const. When then? Faust. Press me no further, For I can only answer with my Tears. Const. Speak, for I'll know th' Extremity to nightâ Why then to morrow; but by Heav'n no longer; For now I've sworn too. Faust. But I vow'd first: And swear again to keep that Vow till Death. To morrow and to morrow, add to those Ten Millions more. You never shall embrace meâ Const. Is't possible! after thy Faith was given! Faust. Not given, but by a Conquerour compell'd. Const. And hast thou rightly scan'd the Conqueror's Rage! Ha! Fausta! hast thou plac'd thy Fathers Fate Before thy Eyes? And thought upon thy own? Faust. Just to your purpose: I'm prepar'd for Death, Rather than entertain you in my Bed: Therefore if you set down t'enjoy me, Sir, Or doom me dead, upon the Earth I beg you To speak your Will. And Fausta shall revenge you. This Ponyard strait shall act your vow'd Revenge, And take her from the World.â Const. Rise, Fausta! riseâ By Heav'n I find 'tis vain to strive against thee! Take then what more thou valu'st than the World, And what, in spite of me, the Fates ordain theeâ My Crispus for thy Loveâ Faust. Ah, Sir, what mean you? Const. Why would'st thou strive to hide what Nature shows? Dalmatius, Arius, and Sylvester, know it: And over-wrought me for my Empires Safety, To this great Act to yield thee to my Son. Faust. Did Arius too? No sure, they rather wrought you To yield me to my Graveâ Const. No. To my Throne: Already 'tis decreed: my CÃ¦sar weds thee. Not but I own I came to work thee from him. But since not Death it self can daunt thy Love, Forbid it Heav'n, that I should break such Union. Haste Arius! Call my Son. I'll give him now; Now while my Reason lets me see my Dotage. How ill such Autumn suits thy Beauties Spring! But haste and bring him, while the heat is on me; For I will have you wedded in my presence: And if thy Heart consent to make a Turn, As strange as kind; this Night he shall enjoy thee. Faust. Oh Heav'n, instruct my Frailty what to answer! Can this be real Sir! is't possible? Const. My Council know it; and confirm the Order. Faust. That I shall wed your Son? Const. Why thus repeated? Faust. And you approve it? Const. Canst thou doubt me still? Faust. No. I will own Sir, since you approve it: Own it to Death, I love him more than Life. Const. O Fausta! Faust. Ha! what now? He turns away. He blushes! GodsâI'm lost, betray'd, undone! Undone for ever. Crispus is betray'd: The innocent Crispus.â Const. Guilty, guilty Crispusâ And guilty Fausta! Guilty both to death; But most my Son who wrought thee to this ruin. Faust. O say not so. 'Twas Fausta wrought your Sonâ And over Lov'd him, to his own destruction, Therefore as you're powerful be just, And let the stroak of Vengeance light on me. But Sir for himâ Const. For him each Syllable Thou plead'st in his behalf but wings his death. Faust. By the just Heav'ns! And by the Saint that bore you, By your Religion Sir, I do conjure you, Spair, spair his Innocenceâ Const. If thou consent, That I this night shall wed thee.â Faust. Wed me Constantine! Const. Fausta, Why not? Art thou enjoy'd already, married? Speak, confessâ That I may pardon theeâ Faust. What you know, you know; You have betray'd me once, but shall no more: More! There's no more, but that I Love your Son, And whether he Loves me, the Gods can tell: I know the natural goodness of your temper, How e're transported will not let you kill him. Therefore I leave youâ Const. Stay and tell me when; When I may hope Loves Consummation sure? Faust. When you behold me Wedded to your Son, As you engag'd, and past your Royal word, When after many rowling years I bring you A race of smiling Boys to bless your Age, To play about your Throne, and be your CÃ¦sars: Then may your happiness compleated be, Then may your Eyes the Consummation see, But never hope for other joys from me. Ex. Fausta. Const. What Arius! help and free me from this plunge Of Love and Nature. She Loves; She Loves to Death; And tho she hides it, is belov'd agen. Arius. What's your resolve? To give her to your Son? Const. No Arius; first I'll give her to the Graveâ Resign my Empire: Allâ Arius. Then Crispus diesâ Const. If he has not enjoy'd her, he shall live, For that I Lov'd him once is full as true As that, tho now he has sin'd, I cannot hate him, But if enjoy'd! How shall I find it out? I'll seise and Rack him. Arius. How Sir, Rack your Son! Const. By Heav'n 'twas well remember'd by a Villain: Therefore I swear thou shalt be Rack't thy self. Arius. Who I, my Lord? Const. Ay Villain: Traitor, Thou! I'll Rack the Racker, till I find it out; For my misgiving Heart says thou know'st more: Therefore, when next I see thee, bring me proof, She's not enjoy'd, her vows and vertue clear; Do't, or thy Death shall teach succeeding Kingsâ No more by false reports to be abus'dâ But strait confront th' Accuser with the Accus'd,â To prove the Treasons urg'd against the Throne;â Or show the Sycophants that set 'em on: So shall the Soveraign pow'r unclouded sway. When such Court Devils, shun the glorious Ray, And drive like Foggs, before the rising Day, Exeunt. End 3d. Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Fourth Act: Scene 1st. Enter Annibal and Serena. Annib. Then you confess you did bespeak the Picture? Gods! and you own you Love him! Love the Traitor? Seren. Call him not Traitor, Annibal, he who spoke The kindest things of you. Annib. Wondrous kind! Accurst dissembler! That could speak for me, But acted for himself. Seren. Just contrary. For when by signs, which passion could not hide, I let him know my Love; he turn'd away, Shaking his head as loth to understand me, Anger and pitty combating in his Face, And with his blushes taught Serena shame. Annib, Shameless himself, and Traitor to my friendship! For all I have heard, your Love has forg'd to save him. Seren. Heav'n knows 'tis true! Nothing was left unsaid, To his own disgrace and your Immortal Honour: In the most melting Terms and sweetest words That Heart could think, or Friendship could invent: Therefore forgo my Lord, this fruitless passion, And speak for Crispus as he spoke for you. Annib. I will; and speak so loud the Gods shall hear me: There! Take his Picture, feed your hungry passion, Till with my Sword I carve another feast, To glut your fatal Eyesâ Seren. Hold; Whither go you? And what fierce purpose has your Heart in hand? Annib. I'll tell thee: And if possible force a warmth In that cold Breast; kindle a dying spark, In that inhospitable Land of Love; And never see thee moreâI go to die, To blot my youth and glory from the World; Tho Conquest waits my Sword, I swear to die, And make thee sport with my untimely fall. Seren. To die! By whom? For what? Annib. For Love of thee. But if I suffer by the Hand of Crispus, And perjury should prosper in my ruine. Then you may revel in each others Arms, And laugh indeed at my ridiculous fortune. Yet, if revenging Ghosts have power to rise, Expect me at the Riot of your joys: With hollow Eyes, to stare you in the Face, At midnight, look to have your Curtains drawn; Expect me in your Bed, a Coarse of clay, To clasp your trembling Limbs with cold embraces, And print my gelid kisses on your Lips, So to revenge my death upon your scorn, And groan about you till the dawning mornâ Exit. Seren. Stayâand I'll tell thee; 'tis impossibleâ Crispus already is in Love with Faustaâ He's gone to the execution of his purposeâ And Crispus must be slain: Why then my Hour. Of Fate is come: What's that to Crispus murder? He's gone to fight; perhaps not give him leave, But take the Innocent at unawares; Haste after him, and by thy own destruction, Prevent both ruins, follow the fate that wafts thee, And let no interrupter cross thy passage. Exit. Enter Constantine, Sylvester, Dalmatius. Const. Were you both Fathers, and in Love like me; I no more doubt, what you would put in Act, Than now I doubt my self, who am resolv'd. Dalm. On what? Const. On Death. Sylv. Of whom? Const. Of any man That knows, yet hides this secret Treason from me. Dalm. Has Crispus own'd he Lov's her? Const. Yes, in effect; For when I first reveal'd this contract to him, He stopt me from enjoying her with Oaths. He knew her false, forsworn: To whom? To him; To him himself: For this last night I prov'd; Drawing the secret from her by a wile, Which she before as craftily conceal'd. Dalm. But have you married and enjoy'd her, Sir? Const. O no; the Ceremonies and the dues, Without a blush were frontlesly deny'd: In all the Heat of boyling Love deny'd: Not only from possessing her that night, But, matchless impudence! deny'd for ever: Now judge if 'tis not fit I should let go The strugling Thunder, and destroy 'em both. Dalm. Not bothâfor yet you have not heard your Son; Hear him but pleadâ Const. Then let him plead in time. Ex. Dalm. The Bolts are brandish't, and 'twill be too late, To lift his blasted hands, when I have hurl'd. Sylv. How far Sir, would your utmost search extend? Const. To know if Actually they have embrac'd Each other, as in will th' have done already. Sylv. Be not too hasty in your Answer Sir, If I should ask what then; What then must follow? Const. Death certain, on the instant; imminent Death; Death; And I swear not all the Gods shall save him. Sylv. Ruin of piety! Not all the Gods! That your Religion? Const. Oh forgive me, Saint, I am eaten up with passion: So o're-wrought, With racking Love I knew not what I said. But if he has enjoyed her: By that power Whom thou remember'st well, I now adore. His Death must wash th' incestuous Guilt away. Sylv. Not Incest, Sir? Const. Not if he has enjoy'd her? Sylv. No: for to prove the Guilt compleated Incest, You must have married and enjoy'd her first. Const. True; but what makes his Crime deserving Death More than imputed Treason, Incest, all; All Faults by Art and Nature joyn'd in one. If he has touch'd her, she must ne're be mine; And that's a Cause so pointing to his Fate, That Death's their due that offer to excuse him. Silv. He comes.âI'm silenc'd. Nature, now or never. Enter Crispus and Dalmatius. Crisp. O Emperour! for I dare not call you Father, Behold me at your Feet prepar'd for Death. Const. O Crispus! for I must not call thee Son, Justice surveys thee as a Criminal. But rise then and speak; plead like a Man for Life. Come on, and look thy Father in the Face; I call thee Traitor, and I'll prove thee one, Who impiously, for all my former Love, Hast dar'd to violate my sacred Bed. Now answer Criminal. What canst thou say That Sentence should not pass upon thy Treason? Crisp. Most aweful Emperor, my Judge and Father! Father, alas! I would have offer'd first. But since you are not pleas'd it should be so, I'll do as Criminals use, and you command: Thus plead my Innocence at your Judgment-Bar; If either, Sir, I saw or lov'd the Princess, You were the only Cause, 'twas you that sent me: So far from once but hinting this your Contract, You told me Sir, her Fate was yet in doubt; Which made me wonder when I saw the Virgin, So innocent, so beautiful, so young: Which Charms did more my Admiration move; Wonder begot my Pity; that my Love. Const. But if I told you that her Fate was doubtful, I told you too, she was a Foe to Rome; Therefore, to think of loving her was Treason. Crisp. If Love be Treason, Sir, I own I am guilty; Guilty indeed; because it was a fault, In any Case to wed without your Knowledge: But yet I hop'd, in time you might forgive me; And so my Conscience tells me still you would, Had you not been engag'd your self before. Const. Rebellion, not thy Pardon, was thy Thought: If otherwise, how canst thou answer Traitor, For not confessing all when first I met thee? Crisp. Pardon me Sir, for that I had done too, Had you not told me first you were betroth'd; But conscious then, how closely I was link'd, I durst not tempt your Wrath. Const. How closely, Traitor! Hast thou then enjoy'd her? Crisp. Can you forgive me? Const. No. By this shaking Flesh Tho there thy Mother kneelt too by thy side. If thou hast touch'd her, Death and Curses on thee. Crisp. Oh by those Knees and Hands which I must hold, Racks, Racks, and Death; but not your Curses, Sir. Const. If thou would'st have my Blessing, swear then, swear Thou hast not enjoy'd her. Crisp. Swear then to forgive me. Const. Forgive thee, Villain! if thou hast possest her, Speak, or be curst. Crisp. I will: but give me time. Const. Let go. What time? Thou hast confess'd already By that Demand; I swear thou hast enjoy'd her. Crisp. Swear not, and I'll confess this Moment. Const. What! Crisp. O Heav'n, What if your Son has plighted holy Vows? Const. Why then I make that Vow and Marriage vain. Therefore, if thou hast not embrac'd her yet, I charge thee, on my Blessing, never hope it, Nor ever think of loving her again. Crisp. Impossibilities! Were you a God, And doom'd me thus, I could not, Sir, obey you: For I have sworn to love her while I have Life; And if I love her I must hope Enjoyment. Const. Death then and Curses on thy Disobedience! Off Villain! Traitor! grovel there on Earth. What, are you Plotters too? nay, then 'tis time To haste his Ruine. Ruine is thy doom; And wing'd with all my Curses it shall come. Ex. with Dalm. &amp; Sylvester. Crisp. Dalmatius and Sylvester! Call him back, And I'll renounce my Love: Heav'n 'tis too much! But hark! I hear a Voice cry, Crispus come, Come to the thoughtless Grave where all is still. It shall be so: up then, and fall a Man. Come forth, thou Minister of others Fates, And be thy Masters now! Where art thou, Fausta? Where is my Love to close my dying Eyes? Enter Annibal. Annib. Ha, Traitor! Art thou then prepar'd for Death? Crisp. Yes Annibal, I will receive it calmly, From any Hand but thine. What have I done That he should call me Traitor? Annib. Guard thy self, Or else by Heav'n thou dy'st. Crisp. Hold. Is't possible! so quickly? Can the desire of Empire lose a Friend! My Father I offended, but not Thee; Execute then the Ruine which he dooms, Ungrateful Man. I will not make Defence, But spread my Arms t'embrace the Death he sends me. Annib. What thou deserv'st from him I neither know Nor care, resolv'd upon my own Revenge; Not but I think the Man who did his Friend So horrible a Wrong as thou hast done, Is fit for any Mischief. Therefore guard thee. Crisp. Never to fight with thee; not tho my Father Should grant my Love. Therefore I sheath my Sword. Annib. Traytor, Coward. Crisp. Oh Annibal, I know I am no Traytor. And thou whose Life I have so oft preserv'd, Know'st but too well I am no Coward. Annib. Draw. Draw then, or perish. By the Gods I'll kill thee: Strikes him with his Sword. Be what thou wilt: and take this to provoke thee. Crisp. Well Annibal. 'Tis well. Thou hast done well. Yet thus much Villany am I content to bear; No longer, oh ungrateful for thy sake. Who injur'st me, yet will not tell the Cause. But for thy noble Father I will spare thee, Spare thee thus far; so thou resolve to leave me. Annib. Not yet? Why then another? Crisp. But the next Be mine: Humanity can bear no further. Annib. falls. Annib. I have my Death: and now my Heart relentsâ Crisp. Cut off my Hand. Annib. Crispus, thou hast wrong'd me. Crisp. Speak how, and where? Enter Serena. Annib. See, she comes to tell thee. Serena, Oh Serena! Dies. Crisp. Gone for ever! Seren. Oh, never to return! and I, alas, Who could not love again, the wretched Cause! Crisp. The Cursed Cause. Seren. Call me not Cursed, Crispus, Who think no Blessing equal to thy Love. Crisp. Wert thou a Man, by Heav'n such Love I bear thee, I think that I should seek thee through the World; To give thee Deathâ Seren. Take then the Death you threaten, Prepare to suffer by a Virgins hand. Crisp. Kill me, and I'll forgive thee Annibal's Death: But take this Sword, yet reeking with his Blood, And thrust it through my Heart. Seren. Yet hold Serena: What will become of him when thou art slain? Kill himself last, and that I would prevent. Crisp. Why dost thou stay? Enter Sylvester. Silv. Crispus, I come to tell thee, Thy Father will not bear us. Seren. Take these Swords, Sylvester; bear 'em hence, Without Reply,âor Crispus kills himself.âAway. Sylv. Crispus Death! I thank thee Heav'n! that sent me to preserve him. Exit. Crisp. Why hast thou thus delay'd my Ruine? Seren. To make thy Torments lasting, Live, that my Ghost and Annibal's may haunt thee; Yet when I come, believe, for all my Threatnings, My Soul shall seek thee in a gentle form: Court thee to Cells, and to the Garden shade, And tell thee there, what Love with us is made; What Fires the Fiends for willfull Murder make; And what my Spirit suffers for thy sake. But hark! I'm call'dâbehold the Dead awake. They waft me, Crispus, to the sleepy Shore, And I shall never, never see thee more. Ex. Seren. Crisp. She's gone: and takes the means of Death too from me. So what's the next? What have the Fates to add To my past Sufferings? Lightning blast me, Mountains fall on me, gape to the Center Earth, To hide me from my friend. Enter Dalmatius. Dalm. Why my dearest Crispus! but alasâ In vain I urg'd thy Father, deaf to all, Our prayers, remorsless, rocky and unmov'd, Yet think not but I press'd with all my Love. Crisp. Therefore in great requital for thy Love Look there, and let thy Blood congeal to Stone, Behold thy Annibal butcher'd by this Hand. Dalm. Cold, cold my Boy. Crispus. Have Iâhave I? But I waste time by such unmanly wailing. Take to thy Sword. Crisp. Thou seest I've none: but strikeâ Dalm. What could provoke thee to this horrid deed? Crisp. His jealousie, and Anger of the Heav'ns: Jealous I robb'd him of Serena's Love. He call'd me Traitor, Coward, strook me twice, Before I drew, than ran upon my Sword. Dalm. Whatever happen'dâI'm a wretched Father, And thou hast robb'd me of an only Child. Therefore hereafter we no more are one, Where e're I go I'll ask before I enter If Crispus be not there? that I may shun thee. Therefore if thou hast any Gratitude For those kind offices, which I have done thee, Fly these sad Eyes, as I will run from thine, To moan my Son, and howl my life away. Ex. Dalmatius. Crisp. Sol. And whither thou? Thou heap of walking woe! Thou that hast pull'd thy Father's Curse upon thee; Kill'd thy best friend, and ruin'd all that Lov'd theeâ Where will at last thy Cruel fortune drive thee? Hence tear thy Robes: And naked fly the World; Unmantled to the Weather, wander on To some dark wild, where Sun-beam never shone. Ex. Crispus. Scene II. Enter Constantine, Arius, Fausta, Sylvester. Faust. Consider Sir his Youthâ Const. I have consider'd allâ But find thy Love so rooted in my heart I must forgo my life, or lose my Claim. Yet mark how deep thy tears have wrought my temper, If thou wilt swear to null my marriage with him, By wedding me in publick, and, this night, By making me thy Lordâ Faust. No Sir, 'tis impossible, yet if you'll swear, To save your Son if I should prove him guiltless: I'll tell you wonders Sir, which otherwise Not Racks shall e're compel. Const. Forbid it Heav'n! I should destroy the guiltless, Tho strangers to my blood, much less my Son: Therefore I swear by Heav'n and all the Saints, Prove Crispus innocent he shall not die. Faust. Be witnesses, Oh Arius and Sylvester! What he has sworn: Let Crispus strait be call'd, And quitted of his Crime: Run, Arius, haste, That I may see the Royal friendship made. Ex. Arius. Const. By an entire surrender of thy self, To me. Faust. To Crispus! Const. By all thy former Oaths I swear to me. Faust. I told you, 'twas impossible before, And now confirm it. Const. How? Faust. I am married. Const. Curses and Vengeance. Married! say by whom? Faust. To Crispus. Const. When? Thou false one; When? And where? Faust. Here in your Palace, on that happy night, Before you made your dreadful triumph. Const. Dreadful indeed: For now the wretch shall die, Tho Angels pleadedâ Sylv. Emperor, you have sworn. Const. I know it Sir, to spare the innocent blood; But I will prove him now. Faust. White as the Saints; By all the powers of Heav'n and Earth I swear, 'Twas I that push'd the marriage: Conscious before, What I had sworn to you; nay cast the Veil Of Modesty aside to make him sure, And after Marriage, you may ghess the rest. Const. Oh Curses! Vengeance! Curses yet unthought! Such Curses as thou wilt let fly at me, When thou shalt see his Head beneath the Ax, Even Womans Curses on thee. Sylv. How Sir, the Ax! Enter Arius with Crispus. Const. Dost thou not find the Traitor? But see he comes. Oh thou dissembler, answer, Didst thou not tell me, when thy life was stak'd, This marriage was not yet consummate, speak. Crisp. 'Tis true dread Sir. Const. Mark all he has confess'd! His own mouth has condemn'd himâhe shall die. Crisp. I own'd Sir, I was marry'dâbut confess'd no further. Const. How Traitor! Did I not force the Question often? Crisp. True; Which I as often wav'd with low submissionsâ Const. Yet those thy low submissions all were lies. For well thou know'st thy subtle working wrought me To a satisfaction that thou hadst not possest her. Crisp. That was alas my Crime. Const. That Crime was Treason: Purpos'd abuse. A Plot upon thy Father. Nay the whole Cozenage shows thee rank in sin, Or Ha!âHow know I yet she is enjoy'd. I have but thy word and her's, and both are Traitors, But see my Brother comes to joyn my Justice. Enter Dalmatius. Dalm. What, Crispus here? Const. Stay, my Dalmatius, stay. Dalm. Your pardon Sir, There's one among you, whom I cannot suffer, And Crispus knows the Cause. Exit. Dalm. Crisp. Come back, and hear it then, Hear thou unhappy Father, hear me own The murder which this Cursed hand committed, That band that slew the wretched Annibal. Const. Annibal slain! O Traitor! And by thee! Is murder added to thy Treason too? Crisp. It shall not stand me Sir instead to say, Mistaken Annibal forc'd me to his ruin. For see I lay my Body at your Feet, And plead for Death, as others begg for Life. Const. Cleanthes take himâCrispus thou shalt die, Therefore be this our fatal last farewellâ One struggle more. His Mother's in his Eyes. Faust. And where's his Father; but in all his form? His every grace; his smilesâAll but his frowns: So exact in Body, Qualities of Mind, That if you kill your Son, you kill your self. Oh therefore listen to the call of Nature, And once more view him with an Eye of Mercy. Const. I have lookt my last, and now am Judg agen. Cleanthes! Take 'em both: They 're both your Prisoners, Crispus and Fausta. Ariusâlook you to 'em! Keep 'em apart; and wait me in my Closetâ What yet agen? 'Tis the last tugg of Natureâ And yet anotherâWhy that sigh uncall'd?â And these wet Eyes? Ohâif I longer stay! My vows of Justice will dissolve awayâ Ex. with Sylvester. Manent Crispus, Fausta, Arius, Guard. Faust. Ruin on ruin, let destruction come, With all the wings of the most violent death, Yet arm'd with Innocence, I'll face the Gorgon, And brave his bloodiest Terrors: But thy death, My Crispus death, my spirit cannot bearâ Therefore I have resolv'd, and think not Crispus, Think not thy tears shall move me from my purpose. Crisp. Speak Fausta; speak, how come these Earthquakes here? And these o'reflowings? Why do the sighs redouble? Faust. Because my dearest life; my all; my Crispus, Soul of my Soul, that's martyr'd for thy Loveâ I am resolv'd rather then see thy death, To wed thy Father.â Crisp. Ha! Do I hear thee truly? But speak agen, for I'll not trust my senses. Faust. To wed him Crispus. Crisp. Sorrow sure distracts thee.â Faust. Noâtis th' effect of reasonâ That makes me desp'rate in this last resolveâ Crisp. No more of this. Haste, cast the poison up, Tis Hell that tempts thee to Eternal ruin. Therefore if thou desir'st my spirit shou'd part In peace, and leave my Love and blessing with thee; Repent this last result of thy despair, Lest I conclude thee false.â Faust. How false, my Crispus? Crisp. False to thy Vows, unconstant to thy Love, And that thy Soul unable for a ruin, Chose rather to sustain an infamous life, Then die with honor. Faust. Oh I cannot bear it! Crisp. Not when I begg thee with my latest breathâ Faust. Thy death my Dear! And I the hated Cause? Crisp. Therefore I Love thee: And wou'd die agen For such another proof of thy affection. Faust. As wrought thy death?â Crisp. Thy purpose was to save me, And die thy self. Therefore let's fall togetherâ Be not cast down, my Fair: But raise thy Eyes, Those watry setting Suns, shine forth, my Fausta, And make our Love look beautiful in ruin.â Enter Souldier. Arius. The Emperor sends agen to have you parted. Faust. Oh Crispus! Whither now? Crisp. To our long name, Where purer Spirits drink immortal Air: And thin clad Souls in flying Chariots move, And give, and take, an everlasting Love. Faust. Such Love grant Heav'n, our meeting Souls betide, Which no inhumane Father may divide: Where at first sight, our minds enlarg'd may spread; Thro' all the space, and know the mighty Dead. Such is my hope: But, Crispus, What my fear? If I should seek: But never find you thereâ Crisp. One last Embrace! Oh Fausta! do not stain, Our bliss with fears, we ne're shall meet again. Through all the Heav'n in all their Mansions blest, To ev'ry Saint my Prayers shall be addrest Nor shall the happy tast a moments rest: Till some kind Angel guides my wandring Eyes, And shews me where thy charming spirit flies. Then Crown'd with joys, we never knew before, We'l waste the stock of Loves immortal store, And cruel fate shall never part us more. Exeunt. End 4th. Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Fifth Act: Scene 1st. Enter Dalmatius and Serena. Seren. Now Sir, you have it all, the whole sad story Of your unhappy Son, his Love and mine: Serena's Guilt and Crispus Innocence; Therefore if you ask blood, and would revenge him; Here waits his Murdress, for the stroak of death. But hate not Crispus: Hate not the Innocent: Much less proceed to the Murder of your friend, Your faultless, guiltless, too deserving friend; The gentlest, best, of all the Imperial Race. Dalm. No more: There needs no more; my Son is dead: Eternal peace attend him: A few sad drops, And now no more; Serena, I believe thee. My Heart avows th' Innocence of my friend; Which I had own'd before, had not the wounds Of Annibal, lain green upon my Soul; But that I now forgive him be thou witness, Be witness Heav'n, and this last resolution, I now put on to save my Crispus life, Or lose my own. Seren. O let me kneel to such exalted Virtue. But Sir, be quick to save him, or this goodness Will come too late. Dalm. Where is the Emperor? Seren. Lockt in his Closet, deaf to the Peoples cries: Fly Sir, I saw him pass in fury by, With Arius in discourse. Dalm. I fear that Traitor. Seren. Your fears my Lord, are mine. I never lik'd him, The Picture which he gave your Son, has shown him: He has all the marks, we Virgins reckon Omenous, A pale, down look, red Hair, and leering Eyes, Mischief is in him: He's with th' Emperor now, Perhaps solliciting the fate we fear. I met 'em Sir, and interrupted CÃ¦sar; Who first receiv'd me kindly; but at the name Of Crispus frown'd, and shook me from his arm. Dalm. Fear not, as thou hast counsel'd, I will join Sylvester on the instant. Seren. Force the door, If he refuse to let you in, do all That pity, love, and friendship can inspire, Do all that I would do, were I Dalmatius. Ex. Severally. Scene II. Enter Constantine and Arius. The Scene a Bedchamber. A Bowl and a Dagger on the Table. Const. Arius! Arius. Sir. Const. I am resolv'd to be at rest, Thou art my friend, Physician, I am sick, Sick even to death: Reach me that goblet hither. The Dagger too. Arius. Sir. Const. What an easie matter It were for any man, in any Case, Tho Rack't with th' Gout, Stone, any kind of torture, With one of these to sleep? Arius. For ever Sir? Const. Right Arius. Arius. Then there is Poison in the Bowl. Const. There is most deadly. Arius. May I, Sir, presume To ask for what? Const. Arius, thou art my friend, I think too, thou would'st venture life. Why yes!â 'Tis Poison, and I'll tell thee too for what: To see how long a Dog will be a dying. Or say, what if we try'd it on a man; Some Enemy that Laws will not take hold of? Arius. Sir, I understand you. Const. Look then you do: How dost thou understand me? Arius. Why thus you past your Oath, your Son shou'd live, If Fausta prov'd him Innocent. Const. 'Tis true: And spite of my revenge, my Heart must clear him. Arius. Right Sir, I find it, you are grip'd in Conscience, Now if a Friend should help you: So: or fate Not always answering most mens Expectations, Should call your Son to Heav'n. Const. To Heav'n Arius! Arius. To Heav'n, or Hell, it matters not for that, So he be out o'th' way, and you not know't. Const. And I not know't? Arius. No Sir, nor I. What then? How then! you never see him more. And so farewellâI'll take this Poison with me. Const. Stay stay! Come back. How strange a guilt is mine, who dare not speak, But indirectly, what my Soul desires Directly done. Why shou'd I hide my thoughts From thee? Arius. Why Sir indeed? Const. When no Eye sees. Arius. None. Const. None but the Eye of Heav'n. But Walls they say have Ears: Therefore we'll whisper This Horrid, Barbarous; and Unnatural Murder! Give him his Choice. Tell him I cannot live, Unless he dies: Tell him I strove to save him, And nature pleaded wonders in his Cause. Arius. I'll stabb him first, and tell him after.â Const. No, Poison's the gentler Fate. Thou art too lowdâ O Conscience how it heaves, within my bosomâ Arius. Conscience! The Souls rising of the Lights. Drink Blood.â Const. Blood say'st thou! What the Blood of Crispus? Hark! Who's there? Run to the Door! Say I am not well, I'll not be seen to night. Arius. Your fancy Sir. Const. I thought I heard my Mothers Voice. But she's long dead: 'Twas as thou say'st, my fancy, My fear, my guilt that haunts me: But begone, If he must fall there is no hiding it: Call it no longer Murder, but a Justice, Survey him as a Thief that robb'd thy Soul Of all its wealth: Ariusâhow am I now? Arius. All Emperor. And Sir I'll haste to obey you. Const. Thou shalt: But go not Arius, till I send theeâ All Emperor, and Judge. But where's the Father? Work me there Nature, save him if thou canst; Remember him as once thy bosom-love. Arius. I like not this Remembrance. Const. Remember the whole Progress of his Life; Obedient all, ev'n in his Infant Years: When every Morning to my Bed-side he came, And as I blest him, thank'd me with his Tears. Serena knocking without. Seren. My Lord, the Emperour. Const. Arius, hark. Who's there? Hark, 'tis my Wife. Run to the door. My Wife! She's risen from the dead to save my Son. Seren. I will have Audience. Ari. Madam, you must not enter. Const. Arius, Let her in. Enter Serena. Seren. CÃ¦sar, Save thy Son; Save him in time; the People are in Arms. Dalmatius, with the Guards, is gone to quell 'em. Const. How! mutiny? And in my Sons behalf? Is this the course to save him? Arius henceâ And execute my Orders. Seren. May I think it? A Bowl of Poison, Sir: Is that your Order? Const. There is no Mystery now to be conceal'dâ 'Tis as you said: And Crispus dies this Minute. Arius away. Seren. He sha'n't, till you hear me. Think Sir, oh think! Const. I've thought too much already: But with this last Revolt my Heart is steel'd; Though as you enter'd I was fooling Time With Thoughts of Mercy. Seren. And has this cursed Wretch prevented you? Const. Dalmatius and Sylvester will be here To hinder Justice: Break her Hold. Away. Seren. Fall then Serena first. And stay that fury. Stabs her self. Const. Arius, come back. What hast thou done Serena? Seren. I've paid the Debt of Nature e're my Time. Const. 'Twas a too honest Part. What was the Cause? Seren. The Love of Crispus: Love of him you hate. But let this Victim to Despair suffice. Enter Dalmatius and Sylvester. Your Brother here! Dalmatius pardon me. Your Son is now reveng'd. Restrain the Emperourâ And look to Arius. Oh! She dies. Dalm. The Joys of Heav'n, And an eternal Requiem waste thy Soul. Const. Brother, How are the People? Dalm. All hush'd again. Why will you harbour, Sir, that Snake about you, That puts you on these fatal Resolutions? For, else could it be possible a Prince So good, so full of every Kingly Grace, Should once conceive a Thought to put his Son, His guiltless Son, to an untimely Death, Without the Instigation of a Devil? Sylv. Consider, CÃ¦sar, you that have had the Glory By Miracles from Heav'n to be converted: We know your Passion manacles your Reason; But here are Hands to help you. Const. Is that then the Result of all your Reason? To hope for sober Actions from a Mad-man? Dalm. Not till the Frenzy leaves him. But we know You are not so far gone, to lose all Temper. Your Hopes, and Fears, your broken Resolutions, Are Symptoms all of a most noble Nature, Where Judgment seems half sunk, but not quite drown'd. Const. Why this I can alledge as well as you; I know the Lawrels which I've worn so long Must wither: If my Son should find a Grave, My present Fame, and Glory too hereafter, Is all upon the hazard: But what then? I see the Storm before me threatning Wrack, I see the Shelves, but who can point the Shore? Syl. Cast over-board the Casket of your Love. I know 'tis precious; but 'twill sink you, Sir. Divorce her, Sir; and give her to your Son. Const. Forgo my Fausta! 'tis impossible. Dalm. Nothing's Impossible to a Mind resolv'd: But pass beyond Sylvester's mild Remonstrance, And ease your Love by Death, by Fausta's Death. When she is past Recall you'll love no more; Envy no more. Const. If that could be resolv'dâ The Conquest were a great one. Dalm. The more you think, the more the Thought will strike you. See but the difference of Counsellors; What Colours good and bad can give to Reason. Had Arius stay'd, by this time you had doom'd Your Son to Death; who now have gain'd the Conquest. Const. Would half were gain'd: yet, since the Start was noble, I'll try to win in this Olympick Race. Tho hilly all the way, and at the Gole The Summit touches Heav'n. Dalm. Urge the Necessity; she or Crispus dies: Th' innocent Crispus, or the guilty Fausta That after all her Vows, could thus deceive you. Deceive you both. Who if your Son were dead, No doubt, as quick would practise with another. Const. By Heav'n, why not? She that could swear, and was Forsworn, may swear and be forsworn again: Oh! I remember now with what a Look, An Angel-look, she vow'd. Dalm. Yet with that Look, This Angel, like a Devil, drew in your Son: Methinks the very grossness of the Cheat Should make you loath her. Const. Ha! Dalm. Detest and scorn her. Const. Scorn on her Scorn, and Death Disdain succeed; By Majesty, by Empire, she shall bleed. Silv. Banish her, CÃ¦sar.â Dalm. No Sir; Death, or nothing. Banish her to day, and she'll be here to morrow: Down with her, down; dwell on her perjur'd Vows, When the same Breath that swore her yours for ever Dam'd her anothers. Const. Arius, bring her forth. She dies! I'll sweat and bleed, but I will conquerâ Call, call my Son.âHenceforth but name a Woman, 'Tis Treason to my Ear: Why, what a Plague Might she have here engender'd! Forc'd a Father To put his guiltless Son to horrid Death. Dalm. Royally urg'd. By Heav'n 'twas ever thus. Where Women had to do. Therefore behold her As a Gangreen to the State. Const. And cut her off. Dalm. The Bane of Empireâ Const. And the Rott of Power! Yet there I'll stay and fix my Imagination, On all their Mischiefs, Murders, Massacres. And Seas of Blood they have spilt in former Ages. Woman, no more. And when my Heart is going, Sound but that Name, the pow'rful spell shall bind Beyond Circean and Ãgyptian Charms, 'Twill raise the lowest Devils up in swarms, Unhinge the Globe, and put the World in Arms. Woman that dooms us all to one sure Grave, And faster damns than Providence can save. Exit. Enter Constantine and Fausta. Const. Fausta, thou art false, forsworn. Faust. I say so too. Const. Therefore shalt dye. Faust. I have no other Wish. Const. What, not to live, If I should pardon thee? Faust. That were Life indeed; To gain your Pardon, and to live for Crispus. Const. No, Wretch! remember as you swore to me, I now return; it is impossible. Yet thou shalt dye for Crispus. Faust. And not with him, Sir? Const. No; I've decreed That thou shalt dye to save him. Faust. But have you, Sir, decreed to love him too On Fausta's Death? Const. I have. Faust. Oh! then the Gods Have heard my Pray'rs, which, next to living for him, Was, still to dye to save him. Faust. Yet grant me Sir in Death One last Farewel. Const. No; thou hast look'd thy last. Faust. Yet you may let 'em bear me by his Window; If it be possible to snatch a Glance, And not delay my Execution, Sir. Const. She weeps; and there is Magick in her Tears. I shall weep too. Bring forth the Poison. Hasteâ She shall not stay the making of a Bath. What Arius! Ari. Sir. Const. Give her the Poison. Haste and see her dye. Faust. Stay Sir, come back. I have no load upon meâ But what you all may know: give me the Bowl; I'll drink it for my Love. Alas my Lord, Methinks one last farewel, had not been much; But since you judge it Sir unfitâI'll die, Without complaining. Therefore tell my Loveâ That my last Pray'r was for his life and yours. Const. Hold Fausta: Arius, take the Poison from her, And bring the Bath. My Son shall see her die, Call Crispus hither, since her Fates decreed, 'Twere just he shou'd be harden'd with the view. She weeps agen. And with the trick unmans me, Spite of my vows, she works my Lyon Heart And melts me into Love. How fares my Fausta? Faust. Sir. Const. Thy hand before we part for ever. Faustaâ I am lostâI'm vanquish't. With a touch o'recomeâ Dalm. Wake Sir. Where are you? Const. Ha! Dalm. Sylvester's here: And Crispus waits. Const. Why then she dies agen. Haste, Bring him in, bring him to my relief. The earning of a Father comes upon me, And my Soul longs to meet him. Fausta, turn; Turn thy bright Eyes on death: And carry fires To scorch new Worlds; but warm the old no more. For here's the rising Sun, to eclipse thy beams. Enter Crispus with Sylvester. O Crispus! Who that has beheld our distance? That infinite space that passion cast betwixt us, Would e're have thought we thus should meet agen? Crisp. What can be added, Heav'n, to such a kindness! Const. What Crispus! What indeed to make it lasting? See'st thou that fair one? Crisp. Sir, you give me hopes; Tho dash't with fears. But hold, perhaps I have to death offended, For sinning but in wish: A dawning joy, Shines in her Eyes, and revels in her smiles, Which seem to tell me, we shall both be happy. Const. Would'st thou be happy in thy Fathers Love? Crisp. Judge me you Powers, if that be not my thought: The utmost reach of my extended Soul, Which knows no other wish, but Fausta's Loveâ Const. And that's the Love, which you, by my example Must learn to hate. Crisp. To hate Sir! What? Const. Hate thy Love: Or what's all one, to bear the effect of hate, Her execution here before thy Eyes. Crisp. My Fausta's death? Scene draws. Arius, Labienus, Eubolus, with a Bath. Const. Behold the Poison'd Bath. Crisp. For meâI am ready Sir. Haste, Launch my Veins: You that are destin'd here for my Destruction, Unrobe meâhasteâ Const. None touch him, on your lives. They may as safely Launch their Emperor, As wound his Son. But Fausta must prepare, There is no other way to reconcile us. Crisp. Then hold me Sir, at everlasting distance, Cast me agen for ever from your sight. Banish me; Curse me, as you did beforeâ But make not Fausta's death the Cursed cause, To save this Villains life. This hangman Traitor, Nay Coward that can live and hear her threatned! Faust. My Love, my Lord, Blame not thy noble Father, Nor Curse thy self, for this was all my seeking.â Crisp. Thy seeking. Ha! And seekest thou my embracesâ After the base dishonor thou hast done me? Hence from my Armsâ Faust. I will not, I will hold thee To my last gasp, and grasp thee after death, Why push me yet agen: Nay, strike me Crispus, I will not leave thy Bosom. Crisp. See he's goingâ By my blest Mothers Soul, let me come at himâ Const. Arius, see it done. All Prayers are vain; some of you, break his hold. Crisp. Dalmatius and Sylvester will not sure, And for the rest, let me but see who dares. Const. Their Emperor commands 'emâhelp to force him, I charge thee Crispus, leave me, And dare not by this willfulness provoke me. Crisp. I have no willfulness: But these stubborn Tears Hear my last sighs. For groans quite choak my words, My Fausta's life: Or break my heart before you. Faust. Sir, do not hear him, snatch your self away, And leave us hereâI'll hush him e're I die; And send him weeping to you for his Pardon. Const. He sees 'tis vain. And has let go his hold. Withdrawâyet Brother, we'll observe unseenâ I do not like this sudden sullennessâ Fausta farewel, Arius dispatch. No more. Exeunt. Crispus, Arius, Fausta. Executioners. Faust. Now Crispus: Now my Dear, wilt thou forgive me This glorious Conquest of Triumphing Love? Crisp. No: By my Soul, and by my hopes of Heav'n, Not at thy parting groan, will I forgive thee. But rather Curse the hour, when first I saw thee, Curse our first Kisses, Marriage and Embraces, Unless thou joyn meâHaâcome forwarder: With Arius, joyn me, to provide some means, That I may bear thee company in Death. If this thou dost deny me, by the Saints, By all our LovesâI swear thou never Lov'st meâ Arius. By Heav'n my Lord I pitty you; and ifâ Faust. If Arius! What? Thou wilt not joyn his madness? Crisp. Hark Arius: By our friendshipâI conjure thee, For I have sworn I will not eat nor drink: Tho I survive this hourâ Arius. I have the means. Crisp. A Dagger. Blessings on theeâGive't me I sayâ Faust. Arius, thou art a Villain! Crisp. I'll tell my Father, that I forc'd it from thee. Faust. Keep, Keep it from him, or I'll tell the Emperor, 'Twas you that first betray'd him to my Love; And Marry'd us. Arius. Hold Madam! Let me begg youâ Crisp. Now Love, I am for thee. Faust. No! I'll call the Emperor. Oh that damn'd Villain, Traitor, Devil, Arius. Help there without. Crispus is Murder'd. Helpâ Arius. Nay then 'tis time to flyâ Constantine meets him with the rest. Const. Yes Fiend, to Hell, Where thou shalt make thy Damn'd account.âIn with himâ Cast the unblooded Villain in the Bath, Which he prepar'd for others: Throw him in. Arius. Hold Sir, the Bath's not Poison'd. Const. How! Arius. Compassion, for your Empress, Made me contrive this only way to save her. Const. Thou hast done well. Yet in with him, to try. Arius. Hold Sir! And I'll confess, it is, it is, 'Tis Poison'dâPardon. Const. Down with him, keep him down Till he be dead. Then give him to his Slaves.â The Bath sinks with him. O CrispusâWhy? Why dost thou Eye me thus With snatch'd regards? Why dost thou Eye thy Father? Now looking on thy Dagger, now on Faustaâ As if 'twere possible to deny her still? Crispus. Deny her? Why Sir? Mean you then to give her? Const. Or let me stand a Curse to after Ages. It is the hand of Heav'n, not mine that gives her: The Treasons of the perjur'd Arius So turn my Soul, and quite reduce my reason, That I will give her thee without a Pang. Take her my Son, And with her all the blessings, And all the Love, my loaded Bosom bears; The Dews of Heav'n, and these thy Fathers Tears. Crisp. Oh Joys! Faust. Oh Heav'n! Crisp. Fausta! Faust. Crispus! CÃ¦sar! Crisp. Father! But let us prostrateâas a God, approach himâ Thou glorious Image of the Deity! What shall we answer? Const. Crispus! FaustaâNothing; Nothing but rise, and take me in your Arms. Thus brooding o're you with a fruitful Joy, I prophecy by my example led; Such Love and peace, thro' all the World shall spread, And Roman Arts that British Isle adorn, Where Helena Deceas'd, and I was Born. While Crispus thus, to Fausta's Love, I give: And both for ever, in my Bosom live. Ex. Omnes. FINIS.</field>
