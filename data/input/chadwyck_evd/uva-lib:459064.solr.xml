      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Saladine, Aleran, Thorello. Aleran. Troth thou art now a pretty toy of state, Art grown as Grave, and hast as great a share Of business in thy looks, as an old Legate Sent to a Land of Hereticks; Ambassadors Of Spain compar'd to thee, are meer French posts, Dispatch'd with love Letters from th'army to The Court. O, the excellency of travel! Salad. Right, Aleran! Mark, but how much it perfecteth Your very Ape Ere he hath travel'd, alass! What is he, Rude and unqualifi'd? but having once Seen Countreys, gone from Town to Town, he strait Accepts your Pippin, Kissing his Hairy hand, most Monsieur like. Aler. Good Faith, and that is very much! Salad. Nay more! He rides And manages your English Mastiff (Sir) As he had lain in Pension for't at Paris. Thor. Signiors! You have very passible wits O'th' Queens side here? Sure they are employ'd too, When part'clar pleasures have call'd aside The nobler spirits, and left you necessary To the Ladies. What! you read Alciods Emblems To 'em, and the Fables of Æsop in Your elegant Mother tongue. Sal. O, ever Sir, upon long Winter nights, Thor. And on my Conscience they believe those Tales For true, whilst you put off the old Morals, As fine new observations of your own. Sal. 'Faith like enough. We have the pretti'st things in Petty-coats. Sirrah! They'll admire thee, And 'twill be held a sov'raign sign of luck, That thou and the King arrive here together In one day; thou from thy travels, he from The Wars, and the treasure of thy Court collections In France, will be no less valu'd then his Victories on the Coast of Sicily. Thor. Youth, and success in your Amours hath made You as wanton, as Maids at midnight with their Lovers are. Flourish. —Hark! The King, Remove, and borrow gravity a while. Enter Phylenio, King, Radegond, Soldiers of his Train. Phyle. Y'arrive so early Sir, that you will find The Queen a sleep? If she can ever rest, Whose careful fears, both for your safety and Return, have lessen'd much her health. Radeg. And this is worthy of your pity Sir, To find a Lady of her youth, So earnest to destroy her beauty In seeking to deserve your love. King. Advise her Radegond to love me less. Radeg. Love you less. That were to kill her, Sir. King. Would thou couldst help me to another heart? Nature, allows but one, though to a King. And it were cruelty, not kindness to Exact more love from that, then it can give. Enter Queen, and two Ladies. Phyle. See where she comes! Already she hath learn'd You are arriv'd, the spies of Love are swift And universal, as the Beams of Light. Look on Her Sir, with gracious eyes— Queen. My joys are more then I can hide For I Have liv'd to see my vows grow prosperous. How shall we welcome you enough with praise, Since you have brought home peace, and fame, Left death And black dishonor with your enemies. King. Madam, I thank you as I ought! How bless'd Had we been, if he that made such haste to joyn Our hands, had staid till he had got the skill To joyn our hearts? But he was more a Statesman then A Priest, and married Provinces, not us. Queen. Alass! This is a little sudden Sir! 'Tis like a Morn o'er cast with Clouds, ere Men May say the day doth break, no sooner can I boast my joys of seeing you, but I must Become your sorrow, and My punishment. How vainly do I wish, That like your better Angel, I could wait About you still, and be invisible to you; That I might ever serve you Sir, And never be discern'd. King. Would you had all your wishes (Madam) and I (If it were fit to ask'd of Heaven) had mine. But since we are so cruelly proscrib'd, Let's strive to mitigate our sufferings, By making still our visits few, and short; For we can never meet, but we must mourn. And you are wise, to know our sorrows ill Become the triumphs of this day. Queen. You are too quickly weary of our griefs, I could endure 'em longer Sir, so I Might tarry here: But 'tis as hard for me To disobey your will, as hinder fate. King. Be kind then to your self; you may possess That happiness alone, which we Together never can enjoy— Queen. The Peace, which by your valor you have brought Your people home, increase within your Brest, And (as in War) so may you prove victorious (Though at my charge) in all the love you make. He leads her to the door. Thor. Look Saladine! The King may well be held The cheif of his Profession (a grand Courtier) For I ne'er saw so much Ceremony With so little love. Salad. It is your new Court-Justice now? They ever pay the want Of their affection to their Wives, with over-much Civility, but 'tis in publick Sir, at home They think it too much pains. King. Unarm me Radegond. And now, I would thou couldst un-King me too? Radeg. How Sir? King. Phylenio, I am sure, Thou dost not love the King, had I No title left, I should have friends. Why must I struggle then beneath this load. Phyle. This melancholly Sir, is treason 'gainst Your self; and such, as if we durst, we would Rebuke. King. Of what a false, And consuming composition am I made, Resolv'd by all most absolute, yet not So free, as he, that daily fights for food. You are happy, for you are subjects still. Radeg. Your subjects Sir, and that we justly may Esteem our happiness. King. O, you are wise, And constant to your selves, had you but any share Of love for me, you would un-King me strait, And then teach me a sudden way to be no Monster. Phyle. A Monster Sir! We understand you not. King. What am I else, that still beneath Two Bodies groan; the Natural and the Politick? By force compounded of most diff'rent things. How wearisom, and how unlucky is The essence of a King, gentle, yet by Constraint severe; just in our Nature, yet We must dissemble; our very Vertues are Taken from us, onely t'augment our sway? Radeg. Your judgment is too cruel of your self. King. In what's our pitty, or our kindness more Express'd, then when we father other's crimes. As if it were a great Prerogative To make the guilty safe. Our wealth serves but To keep Mens hopes in pay; onely happy When we can purchase friends, because they share And ease the glorious torment of our power. Enter Eumena and Gartha. Phyle. The burden of your thoughts will now grow light, Behold the fair Eumena, Sir. King. Hail vertuous Maid! Why my Eumena, did I strive for Victories abroad, when all My Conquests there, could never recompence My absence from that beauty which I left At home. 'Tis true, that I have done such deeds, As Fame her self shall chuse, even for the last Great story that must fill her Book. The aged And the young Have had sufficient cause to curse thy coldnels In love; for hadst thou kept me here, they still Had been alive. Eume. Could my obedience pay The debt we ow your valor (Sir) thus I Would kneel, till I grew old, so long You should not know me when I rise. He takes her up. King. Eumena, this becomes thee not; for love Hath made us equal, and how poor a thing Is Majesty, compar'd to mighty love? Eume. The changes of my fortune, Sir, Have made me now so wise, I dare not trust Too much to happiness, whose danger comes From its excess, the joys you bring are so Extream, they needs must suffer an allay. Already I have found it too; for as I hastned hither to behold the true Success of all my Horisons (your safety and Return) I met beneath the Cypress shade That borders near the Garden Rivolet. Your beauteous Queen, but sad, and mourning like A Virgin at her lovers Tomb, even she (That is so fair and good) I saw Thus newly ruin'd by your frowns. King. The poor Hermit that nightly is assur'd By visions in his sleep, fasting all day With zealous hope of nourishment from Heaven. The young unpractis'd child, that hath not yet Out grown his native Innocence, hath skill To shape disguises for his thoughts, as much As I, I cannot hide the anger of My grief, and all th'observing world, Can witness it is just; though 'tis as sad A truth, that she is guiltless of the cause. Eume. You make a brave confession Sir. Yet where There is no guilt, your least unkindness seems Too great a punishment. King. But I have heard, during my forc'd Unwilling absence from thee, in this last Sicilian War, she us'd thy tenderness, As if her jealousie had practis'd a Revenge in Envy of my noble Love. Eume. Forgive my anger Sir, They are as false, as Men that cheaply swear For hire; who thus have wrong'd your royal Ear With forged whispers; in dull hope to win My favor by officious wicked courtesie. King. Thou art so full of truth, I must Believe thee 'gainst thy self. Go Radegond And let the Queen know I am penitent; Fall at her feet, and sigh in my behalf, Until thou findst my pardon in her eyes. Exeunt King, Eumena, Radegond, Phyleno. Thor. Gentlemen, may a man without suspition Of treason, think a little odly of the King, Having a vertuous Lady to his wife, Must he needs get a Mistress? But you'll say This Mistress is surpassing vertuous too. Let that be granted; yet— Salad. Disclose your meaning Sir? Thor. Faith Saladine, I mean to ask, Why he Allows his wife the lesser share of's heart, Or rather none at all. 'Tis such a royal Ridle? Well, the Devil is in't, and I Suppose at least ten Devils more; for less (Signiors) cannot suffice this Court. Salad. Thorello, thou art a right traveller, An old acquaintance in every Town Abroad, and a new stranger still at home. Aler. Instruct him, 'tis a raw youth, but he will learn. Salad. Long ere our King was marry'd, know he was Most fervently in love with fair Eumena, And yet our Politicians to joyn Otranto to His Crown (which Neighb'ring Province was the Dower Of our sad Queen) did force him to this Match. Thor. Could he be wrought to wed a Princess for Dull humane ends, when's love was formerly Engag'd. Where are the old Arcadian lovers? Aler. Why? In their Graves, where they sleep quietly. Thor. Had I but once made love, though to a poor Inheritrix of thirteen Pistolets a year, The Queen Dowager of China should not Remove my sute, Signior, I pray proceed. Salad. I soon shall vindicate the King, for (Sir) These subtle managers of his affairs, before They treated with him for the Queen, surpris'd Eumena from his sight; proclaim'd her dead. And more to cozen his belief, did celebrate Her Funerals with much solemnity Through Naples here. Eumena all this time Closely immur'd, some two years after they Did work his sorrows to give way unto Necessities of state, so perfected This marriage with the Queen. Thor. And during this Eumena ne'er was heard of. Salad. She was most carefully conceal'd, and at The Nuptial Feast presented to his sight. Thor. So suddenly retriev'd! Salad. Your Polititians Have ever more a taint of vanity, As hasty still to show, and boast a Plot, As they are greedy to contriv't; but he Requites the falshood of their care with banishment. Though marry'd, yet refus'd to Bed the Queen, And to Eumena strait renews his love. Thor. You have untied the knot. Salad. 'Tis a full Court, Let's hasten to the Privy Gallery, And whisper there a while; for so We may be ta'en for Cabinet Statesmen, And at least be held secret, if not wise. Exeunt. Enter Oramont and Gartha. Gar. My sute will meet much danger in delay, I gave my Lady this (Sir) in her ear; But she reply'd, I'm busie with the King. Ora. Hah! Busie with the King, that sounds not well! Go back! Say my affair concerns her life. Gar. I will attempt to tell her so. Exit. Ora. She is become the peoples secret scorn, Yet from the earliest dawning of her eyes, From the first budding of her beauty she Was bred, withal those bashful fears that guard A Virgins innocence; but who can be Secure in Court, where every tempter Looks so full of power, As if he could forgive more crimes Then's leisure suffers him to act, and not To yield to Kings desires (although unjust) Is disobedience here, not vertue stil'd. His message makes me wonder; yet if There were no other cause of fear, but guilt, I should enough of courage find, to dare All danger, but what comes from Heaven. Enter Eumena. Ora. Can you find nothing (Lady) In this face, that may direct You to remember it. Eume. My brother Oramont! That you are he appears too unprepar'd A truth, to be so suddenly believ'd. He steps a little back. Do not distrust my joys, because they come In tears thus through mine eyes, from whence our griefs Spring forth. My heart, were not the gates too narrow, Would sally out the self-same way to meet you. Ora. Hath she a stock of tears for joys, and such A debt of them to pay unto her sins, 'Twere easier to believe her innocent. Eume. Why seem you so reserv'd? Why will you wear A gravity, that doth as ill become This meeting as your years? Ora. I am a prisoner, Though for a little space my bonds are off. Eume. How Oramont! Ora. The King hath brought Home victory from the Sicilian War. But our attempt upon the Tuscan Camp, Was bloodily repuls'd. Eume. This he hath heard, Yet 'tis a loss he mentions with neglect; For his intelligence believ'd you safe, And marching bither with's remaining Troops. Ora. Fame like a cunning Faulcon falsifies Her flight. Know by the treason of our Scouts I was surpris'd, weakned with many wounds; Those pitious Heaven, hath favor'd with a happy cure, But th'avaricious enemy impos'd Upon my liberty, the ransom of Two hundred thousand Crowns; the value was No less, they laid upon my gen'rous faith, Since they have trusted me to visit thus My native soil, and ta'en my word For my return, within the circuit of One Moon, or else to pay that mighty sum. Eume. It is a mighty sum indeed! Ora. Such (sister) as our Ancestors ne'er knew But by report; nor can I think they would Have laid so vaste a rate, on worthless me; Had they not heard your greatness here in Court. Eume. Can such a trivial grief as this, contract Those wrincles on your brow, and make you old Ere time hath perfected your youth; would they Had doubled what they have impos'd, that I Might yield a worthier tryal of my love. Ora. Eumena, do you know what you desire— Eume. Here Sir, take this. It doth contain in Jewels, She reaches a Cabinet. Enough to ransome you as of't, as Fortune can Betray you to the Fo: Take it, and pay Those Fools of Tuscany, that had not skill To lay a greater price on Oramont. You are my Brother Sir, a title which Includes all that my judging love calls wealth. Ora. Are you so rich! Eumena you have found He takes the Cabinet. A bounteous Master of the King, I dare Not call him yet your lover, that would wound My ear as much as yours; although I know A Maidens tenderness is struck, even with The nicest injury of words. Eume. But were the King a lover (Sir) I can Not think that word would injure me. Ora. Are you so well Resolv'd? Take heed frail Maid. And Heaven! Take heed Of me. If ever yet her Blood hath been Defil'd, make choice of one that is no kin Unto the purer part of it, to let Out the impure, I would not punish her. Eume. What mean you Oramont? How were I bless'd, Could I no more resent those cruel words Then Heaven, to whom you utter them in vain. Ora. Take back your precious trifles, and repent Your treasure is so strangely got; that 'tis not fit For noble minds to use it, though they want. Eume. Strike me with stupid dulness you kind powers, That in excessive wonder I may fail To understand the meaning of his speech. Ora. Away! O flie! Fly from the Court thou young And silly Sophister in Arts of State. The Favorites of Kings are chosen but To own, and wear their Masters worser sins; And what a load thou wilt be caught to bear, When his (oppressing thee) must needs be laid Upon as great a burden of thine own. Eume. Thou cruel, and suspitious Oramont, Whither is all thy vertue gone? I ne'er Believ'd, I could be angry until now, My heart rebels within my Brest, and chides me For every tear I shed, as if on thee My pitty were mispent; yet 'cause thou wert My Brother once, I would not have it said I left thee in captivity, Procure Thy freedom with this wealth—For misery Doth seldom mend, but makes the wicked worse. Ora. I rather will return, my bonds Still wear, as gaudy Bracelets on my Wrists; In a dark Dungeon sit, there mourn thy loss, And curse that treacherous fate, which first did bring Thy luckless Beauty to the tempting King. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter Oramont, Thorello, Saladine, and Aleran. Oramont. You can instruct me Sir, I have a suit Unto the King, and would attend where I May stand within the level of his eye. Take's he this way, in's passage from the Park? Thor. 'Tis not in's pow'r t'avoid you Sir, if you Stay here; but in our judgments, that have got The bold ambition to be stil'd your friends, 'Twere fitter (noble Oramont) men of Your early vertue, and still growing worth, Should have the fortune rather to command, Then wait among the common croud. Ora. You grace me with your kind opinion Sir; But we must rest contented with our Stars. Could we attain the pow'r to pick and chuse I'th' Firmament; he that created them And us, would lose his eminence on Earth, For we should make a God of ev'ry poor Astronomer. Salad. 'Tis Piety to wish You'ld throw your cloudy sorrows off, and not Affect to wear your vertues in the dark. Aler. My Lord, we need you here in Court, and are Not ignorant, that you may make what choice You please in your desires. Ora. Alass, I want The skill how to grow great, the patience to Permit those wrongs, which they that rise Must not alone endure, but praise. Thorello, you have travel'd long, d'ye find No change i'th' Court, since your return? Thor. Faith Sir, not much, now, as before, the steps To high command (like such as up to Steeples reach) Are worn a little with the num'rous tred Of fools, that climb to gaze upon the top. Therefore, 'tis harder to ascend, then if The number of those men that press to rise Were few; but 'tis the same way still, though (As I said) the steps must be uneasie, 'cause Th'are overworn. Ora. I want good parts; my head's to light t'ascend. Salad. O take't on my experience Sir, you should Not load your shoulders with a weighty headpiece, when You mean to mount, the greatest will be thought The wisest still: Therefore they seldom lend A hand, to lift a wiser then themselves. Besides a little head may weigh enough, When cozening Fortune holds the Scale, which she Hath ever done in Court. Thor. Little intelligences of little things, Will serve for universal knowledge here; If whisper'd often with a travel'd face. Aler. And then, an inward safe content we all Injoy, since every one believes he hath Enough to be above others, 'cause he hath learn'd How to contemn 'em. Thor. Nor is There danger Sir, in enemies; for though Each Table feeds a sev'ral faction here, Where they despise the absent still as heartily, As they do eat; yet in the Presence-Chamber The Opposites can smile, laugh, and embrace Like Neighbors, that were newly met Upon a Foreign Coast. Ora. Your observations much encourage me. The King! I pray remove a while. Enter King, Phylenio, and Radegond. King. Is that young Oramont? Radeg. It is: And I believe he means t'address Himself to your compassion Sir. Phyle. He wears his troubles handsomely. King. Leave us, and bid the rest avoid the place. Exeunt. Manent King, Oramont. Come hither Oramont, you carry in Your looks a discontent, which shews not grief Alone, but anger too. I shall admire Your courage, if it points at me. Ora. Far be it from that humble low degree In which my duty ranks me with My King, that I should cherish grief till it Grow up to anger Sir; so I might turn The vertue of that sorrow into sin. King. Young Soldier, you are strangely wise, and have Already got the providence, not to Permit your tongue betray your thoughts, but I Am pleas'd when you are safe; if your Attendance here imply a suit, give it a name. Ora. 'Tis call'd my Ransom, Sir; a debt Which Fortune, not my Error, throws on you. I lost my precious Liberty on an Unlucky day, when I was active in Your service, and 'tis just you now redeem't. King. Be taught the art of thriving in the Court; Reserve my favor for a higher use, although This tax upon your Liberty be large, My bounty may exceed it far; which I would keep To make you wealthy, not your enemies. Ora. I value freedom Sir, above all wealth. King. Do so: But let your sister purchase it. Such kindness to a Brother, may advance Her nature much to popular esteem; Which I endeavor, for I love her well. Ora. 'Twere better she had lov'd her self. King. Hah! Give me your meaning! Ora. It is not worth your taking, and I think My sisters treasure of less value then My thoughts. 'Lass! How should she get riches, Sir? King. Dost doubt I am not lib'ral where I love? Ora. It were a lasting happiness for her, If my suspitions did no more concern Your love, then liberality. King. Away thou jealous fool. Ora. My Honor is engag'd for payment of Two hundred thousand Crowns, or to resign My self, to everlasting bonds. Shall I Return? King. Thy honor Oramont is forfeited Already in thy jealousie. If thou Hast any valor left, return and die. Exit. Ora. What strange divinity is that, which guards These Kings (the lawful terrors of mankind) Keeps them as safe from punishment, when they Oppress the tame and good, as it secures Them from the treachery of the fierce, and bad. Be safe then (cruel Monarch) since still hid Within thy dark prerogative, which is Divine indeed: For 'tis most fear'd, because It least is understood, I will submit Unto my bonds, and keep my honor free. Enter Amadore disguis'd, with a Warrant seal'd. Amad. Health and renown to Oramont! Ora. You greet me with a lib'ral wish, your haste Would be consider'd too, next to your love. Amad. In thy pursuit I have been swift As falling Torrents, or th'Arabian from A Battel lost; the Tuscan Gen'rals son (Young Amadore) salutes thee from his heart; And thus presents thy freedom sign'd— Gives a Paper Seal'd. By's Fathers hand; thy Ransom is forgiven. Ora. Though Amadore be noble, and bestow'd His courteous visits on me, when my wounds Were large, and I was hopeless of their cure; Yet this is such a wondrous bounty, as Requires as much of faith to make it be Believ'd, as gratitude to see it paid. Amad. Take thy assurance, and thy friend together. Pulls off his disguise, and embraces him. Ora. The Roman race of Men, sure is not yet Extinct in Italy, I hold within Mine arms, the Heir, and never fading Branch O'th' noblest stock. Make me as worthy (Heaven) As I am glad for what I have receiv'd. Amad. Couldst thou believe I would permit soft sleep To hover o'er my Fathers eyes, till he Had seal'd thy Liberty. Alass! Why should The valiant, to the valiant, be unkind, Pursuing anger more then cruel Beasts: For in their hungry quarrels they inflict No bondage, where th'are weary to devour. Ora. I have more happiness, then I can well Contain, unless I waste it in a boast; For now I shall not need to be oblig'd Unto my Sister, or the King. Amad. In mighty minds, the pleasure's more sublime To give, then to possess, freely like Clouds That uninvited still their treasure shed In plenteous showers. Oramont draws his Sword. Ora. Joyn now thy noble hand To mine, and let us vow a friendship here, More lasting then our selves; for that may live With our immortal parts. Danger, henceforth Be it in vertuous glory, or in just Revenge, we equally will share. Amad. It is confirm'd. They kiss the Hilts. I shall not need to serve you in disguise; For this Commission will authorise me Here to reside in Treaty from The Army, and the Tuscan State. Ora. 'Twas luckily contriv'd, Fair Favorite; my Sister in thy name, Not blood, take heed; although Intrench'd i'th' arms of the lascivious King, The windy tempest doth begin to swell, The Taper of thy life, now I have joyn'd The fury of anothers breath to mine, Must be blown out, unless it clearer shine. Exeunt. Enter Queen, Thorello, Saladine. Queen. Saw you the King so harsh to Oramont. Thor. If 'twere no error in my loyalty To censure him, I should profess he was More rigid, then became his nature in The first encounter of a servant, so Approv'd by general consent. Queen. Indeed, though's last success i'th' Tuscan War Shews him unfortunate, yet he hath gain'd Fame from his enemies, and hath more fame Then usually belongs unto his years. Salad. Most certain, Madam, 'tis an envy'd truth That's Fame wears many Wings upon her feet, For she hath much out-gone his time. Queen. Did he refuse to Ransom him, as if He grounded his denial on the last Defeat? Thor. We stood not in the reach of their Discourse, but that it was deny'd, we both Are well assur'd, and have some cause to fear, That Oramont looks on his Sister with Suspitious eyes. Queen. Such doubts are dangerous; Try if you singly can get him hither, I gladly would confer with him alone. Thor. Let's hasten to the Tarras walk. Exeunt Thorello, Saladine. Queen. How greedily at Court, knowledge doth still On others secrets feed, though 'tis too false, Too nice a nourishment, and shews her appetite Not sound; for she is weary strait of what She hastily devour'd. Alass! What need My knowledge taste anothers private grief, When secret sorrow is her daily food? But here each man his forward duty pays In needless whispers to his Prince, and thinks He merits by revealing what he should Conceal—. Enter Oramont. Ora. O cruel King! How couldst thou wrong Such vertue, and such beauty too? Were it My crime, Angels, and Men might laugh, when they Should hear my groans in Hell; yet not be tax'd For want of fit compassion— Queen. He brings his sisters eyes! Their influence (I hope) will not so fatal prove to me. Ora. I am commanded to attend your Grace. Queen. Sir, though mine own calamities stand in Continual use of pity and redress, Yet I neglect them now to comfort you. Ora. Madam, such holy kindness can but add To my undoing; for you then will lay Too great a debt upon the conscience of The poor. Queen. The King (sad Oramont) is much To blame; but we like good Physitians must Forbear to make our Medicines violent, And not apply them, whilst his Feaver holds The raging fit. Ora. You wisely may suspect My patience; but shall ne'er have cause to doubt My loyalty. Queen. You must take care of both; And that you may perceive how gladly I Would have you prosperous, I will dispatch Urselli strait to Venice, and discharge Your Ransom, from that Bank my Father left, Protected by the Senate for my use. Ora. Can there be still such goodness in the Sex, And yet Eumena false. Thus on my knee I pay my wonder and my gratitude, 'Tis for a bounty that can ne'er be equal'd, till Your self shall find another in distress. Queen. Rise Sir, and fetch Urselli hither. Ora. No Beauteous Excellence, this yet restores Me to some kind opinion of my Stars, I shall not need to use your Princely gift, Till I grow worthier to receiv't: This day My Ransom was releas'd, and sent me from The Tuscan General. Queen. Thy joys are newly budding, Oramont, But time will quickly make them ripe, tell me, (And by thy love to truth) canst thou receive Such blessings from a cruel enemy, And to thy sister be unkind. Ora. Madam, it seems you know too much, it would more help The quiet of your sleeps, if you dismiss'd Your thoughts, and could be ignorant In others ills, as Heaven is of your own, 'Tis such a wish, (if not too vainly made) As I would covet for my self. Queen. The King, and then your Sister, Oramont; Two bonds upon your duty, and your love, Which you must never forfeit Sir; nor can They e'er be cancel'd, but by nature, when you die. Ora. Good night unto your Grace, may it be long Ere th'Angels call you hence; were such a great Example of fair virtue gone, what would Become of your remaining Sex? Queen. 'Lass! I perceive no words, although contriv'd In charms, can soon allay the mutiny Of thoughts: I'll cease to trouble you in vain, Yet be assur'd, that I believe those doubts (Upon your Sister urg'd) as much Injurious unto her, as they will prove Unsafe to you, good night unhappy Oramont. Exit. Ora. How have they fool'd this righteous Lady to A simple, self-abusing Faith! That she Forgives with credulous consent, the arts And falshood of her Rivals love, no less Inspires my rage, then doth her beauty or Her bounteous heart; though my revenge were dull, And such as noble Justice could not move, 'Twould now take fiery motion from my love. Exit. Enter Eumena, under a Canopy. Boy that sings: A Taper and Book, Cabinet, Cushionet. Eume. Sing me that air Renaldo sent to Grittiline, It is a Song of Jealousie. The Song, which ended. Enter Gartha with a Letter. Gartha, in Errands you are ever slow! Were but your feet as nimble as your tongue, My business would have quick dispatch. Gar. Madam, we have been laughing and shreeking In the Lobby. Eume. Shreeking! At what? Gar. At Cavaliers That start upon us in the dark, like Tumblers in A Warren at their Game, your Ladiship Will spoil your self with melancholly Songs And Books; you'll grow as grave as an old Abbess? Eume. Y'are very pleasant; What Letter's that? Gar. The Queen hath sent it to your Ladiship. Eume. A Letter from the Queen! It is her Character! Reads. Your Brother Oramont is free, his enemies Releas'd him; if then His foes find him so worthy of Their care, why should you want the pow'r to raise him With the King? He hath a great And daring heart, I wish (Eumena) It were as little vex'd, and troubled at Your loves, as mine hath been—Go gentle youth. Exit Boy. Gar. Why, Madam, do you weep? Eume. I prethee Gartha leave me too, I shall Have company enough, though left but with my thoughts. Exit Gartha. In all those Tragick Tales (of which, Loves History Is full) no Virgin can be found, whose fate May equal mine; I am belov'd, where I Not dare to love, and yet not dare to hate; Forc'd to do wrong, yet I not guilty of The doing of it; and 'gainst a Queen, Whose goodness works in such extreams, as it Betrays her own felicity, that it May add a safe continuance to mine. Enter King. King. Light of my Soul, my Hearts refined part, Of which, my better thoughts are form'd! Why dost Thou weep? why like Distilling Roses waste, Dissolving thus thy sweetness to a Dew? Eumena, speak! Eume. Give me your leave To be offended Sir. Can you that cause My sorrows, wonder at my tears? Why will You force your visits on me in the nights Suspitious hours? making your Kingly pow'r Shew tyrannous, where you would seem most kind, Discolouring the beauty of my Fame, Till she turn black, and all the strictly chaste, Gaze on her now with pity, and with fear? King. Who is't hath frighted thus thy Innocence? Makes thee entertain my vertuous love And amm'rously? Thus tim'rously? Emue. 'Tis equal sure To have no Honor, and to have the World Believe that it is lost. Honor's a rich, A glorious upper Vestment, which we wear To please the lookers on; as well as to Delight our selves. King. Honor's a word, the issue of the voice. Eume. The voice, Sir, was ordain'd to satisfie And fill the ears of others, not our own. King. Where is the courage of thy vertue fled? When valiant with thine own integrity, Thou didst resolve to slight opinion, as The vulgar doom. Oft hast thou said, Honor Doth dwell within, and cannot live abroad. For like extracted spirits, in A Viol shut, it keeps its vigor whil'st 'Tis close retain'd; but when dispers'd and mix'd With open air, the vertue so evaporates, That all its value is for ever lost. Eume. O that the World cou'd be instructed thus! But the severe mistake on Womens honors, Must last like other heresies, and be Too strong for Truth, or Reasons force, because 'Tis popular and old. King. We all delight In fair well-looking Fame, but should we dress Her face in every various Glass, which fond Opinion makes; the World would quarrel strait, For sev'ral judgments of her shape, and she As seldom gain the publick vote, as ours. Eume. I feel a mutiny within my Brest, But why should others thoughts disorder mine? King. Neglect those cruel men that injure thee With doubts, and take a pitious care of me. Sustain that love, whose diet is thy looks; If banish'd from thy sight, 'twould starve for Want of nourishment. Love is a mighty Prince, And keeps his Revels, when the Sun is hid. Shouldst thou in sullen fear of jealous fools, Forbid great Love these visits in the night, It might be said, Thou but penuriously Dost feed that Monarch, whom thou ought'st to feast. Eume. No more: I will resign my sorrow (Sir) To those that are possest, with guilt enough Still to maintain, and make it last: And were it not an injury to her, That claims by sacred Rites, a title to Your heart, I could not easily refrain From wishing I might, meet your love with equal flame. King. Let me forget I am confin'd, at least, Not hear it from thy tongue; 'twere cruel when Thou seest a captive in his sleep, to shake His Chains; he would be more tormented with That noise, then with their weight. O do not say Thou canst not love! I rather will beguile My hopes, fondly believing what I dare Not doubt. Eume. I shall forget the rigor of my fate, Remembring yours; and send my pity forth To call those sorrows back, which I too hastily Dismiss'd. King. So thou wilt kill, whom thou dost strive To cure, to Bed my beauteous Favorite, And when thou wak'st the watchful morn (taught by The lustre of thine eyes) will learn first to Begin, then perfect day; she through the nights. Dark clouds must break, thou through the mists of Sutor's breath, Who wait in throngs, upon thy Regal pow'r, For their redress. Eume. Let me resign your favor, Sir, Though to be Mighty, is a just desire in all That covet to do good; yet you may place That painful office, on those that can With safer eyes out-look the slating World: King. Eumena no: Could every one that careless sits On his high Throne, depute his pow'r Where it might mingle with such innocence, Monarchal sway would be belov'd: For 'tis Our worst mistake, to think the Arts of Government So hard; since a perfection in the skill To rule, is less requir'd then perfect will. Eume. The envious waste the night, observing us, Let us depart, though onely to become So good, as not to hinder (Sir) Our very enemies from rest. King. To Bed, to Bed! And whil'st in gentle dreams (the sweets of sleep) Thy heart doth revel, mine, the watch shall keep. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter Oramont, Amadore. Amadore. Without the use of my Commission, Sir, The courteous Radegond procur'd me from The King, a Licence for my stay, Which I believe may last, as long as you Shall think my service fit for your command. Ora. In this disease of grief, that poysons all My blood, and strives to taint my heart, no help From Heaven could keep me living Amadore, But the most precious cordial of thy love. Ama. I wish (Sir) you would stop the current of Your doubts, unless you were provok'd by More receiv'd authority, then Mens reports: Two of the lesser whisperers; that rule But at a distance 'bout the King, To make a friendship with you, have this morn Reveal'd all others secrets to you, and their own. Ora. They've overcharg'd mine ear; were I to meet Them now, I would be deaf. Ama. Could they discover ought that will detect Your sister by such reasons, as her friends Must needs allow, as well as enemies. Ora. Last night the King i'th' dark, and unattended too, Stole to her Chamber, where he staid until The morn did seem most bashfully to blush In's face, but then return'd to his own Bed, As secretly, and single as before. Ama. Unless your judgment be severe and nice, What can it urge from this? Ora. Enough to cause thee hate her too, when thou Shalt read those Coments which observers make, His secret visits; and his favors to her Have perfected so much the suff'rings of The Queen, as now, that Patience, which Before was but necessitously kind, is grown Most willingly devout. Ama. 'Tis strange to me! Ora. Sir, though affliction at the first, doth vex Most vertuous natures, from the sence, that 'tis Unjustly laid; yet when th'amazement which That new pain brings, is worn away, they then Embrace oppression strait, with such Obedient chearfulness, as if it came From Heaven, not Men. Ama. The Queen is then resolv'd? Ora. Most strictly Sir; just now she did implore My aid to that effect. A shout within. Ama. What noise is that? Ora. My glorious Sister comes abroad to day I'th' fresh and early breathing of the morn, She airs her sinful beauty in these walks. It seems a croud of Slaves, whom in her pride, And bounteous ostentation, she redeem'd From Turkish chains, salute her in Her passage hither, let's hasten from her sight. Exeunt. Enter Eumena, Gartha, Ladies, Phylenio, Radegond, Saladine, Thorello, Aleran, Old Courtiers, Captain, and Suitors with Petitions. Eume. Yond' Slaves; are they of Corsica, or those Of Maltha, which I bought from the Gallies of Argiers? Radeg. Of Maltha (Madam) whom you last redeem'd. Eume. Go back, and let the Provost know, they must Be cloath'd, and bid my Auditor give Them a thousand Crowns, but pray Prevent their loud return of thanks. Exit an old Courtier. Radeg. Madam, I beg your goodness would procure The Genouesse may be dismiss'd without A Tax upon his Goods; you will oblige A noble family. Eume. It shall be done. Phyle. The Treasurer o'th' Customs doth present His humble suit unto your gracious care, and hopes The Pattent for the place, may be renew'd. Eume. My Lord, he hath too hastily enlarg'd His Lands: He toils, and reckons for the King, But gathers for himself. I dare not mov't. Sal. The Abbot of Cajeta (Madam) sends His Brother here, to be protected by Your favor, in his first request. He presents a Suitor to her. Eume. I know your business, Sir, The Chancellor of Cuma's dead; and for Regard unto your Brothers Piety, I'll strive you may succeed in that command. Other Suitors present Petitions. You Sir, have got the common hope to help An evil cause with importunity: Pray trouble me no more.— Thor. This (Madam) is a Captain of Puteoli, A modest and a valiant Man; he sues For his arrears since the last War. Eume. I shall deserve his trust; and see it paid. Exeunt all but Saladine, Thorello, Aleran. Thor. Here Gallants, you must make a stop; for still The Privy Lodging doors are shut, to wit, Greatness doth love't, at distance, but not neer, 'Tis held too sharp a spie. Sal. How lovingly Yon Brace of Lords, hug, and consent before The publick Face, as they were Twins, and now (Grown old) would both pursue but equal hopes; Yet th'are of diff'rent Factions, Aleran. Thor. Right Sir, and hate each other with As true devout a heart, as over-zealous fools That differ in their Faiths. Aler. 'Twere good the King would reconcile These civil factions in his Court. Sal. You must excuse him (Sir) the King's too wise, He'd so deprive his ears of those complaints, Which utter'd sev'rally in dull revenge, Furnish his knowledge with their secret faults. Thor. How Aleran! Talk of attoning factions here. I tell thee, 'tis not profitable for The King, that they should reconcile themselves; For in good troth, they seldom do't but at His charge, since they begin that friendship still With mutual courtesies of begging Suits, One for the other, till both sides grow rich In their new truce, by kindly cozening him. Enter Old Courtiers. Sal. Look there! the rev'rend waiters are return'd; The living Furniture o'th'Court, though spent with age; Yet such his Highness Grandsire never bought, But they paid deerly for their places Sir, And so bought him. Thor. Good faithful Squires! Their everlasting business is, slowly To move behind, when the King walks; and When he dines, to stand in a selected croud, as They would stare him out of count'nance. Sal. And yet they take it all, they are not rich. Thor. With reason Sir; for they have waited hard, That is, worn out his Graces Hangings with Their backs, and with their feet, his Mats. I would Have Men of Brain and Courage, fill a Court. Aler. Come, let's in now, and hear them rail at us. Exeunt. Enter Eumena and Gartha. Eume. Who is't that's so importunate? Gar. Your Brother (Madam) and he brings A Lady with him, vested like a Nun. Eume. Give them admittance, and retire a while. Exit Gartha. The choice he makes of his Society, Is very sad and strange. The Queen disguis'd. Enter Oramont and Queen, in a Nuns habit. Ora. The Blessings of the day (great Sister) are So much at your command, 'twere idle ceremony To salute you with a courtly wish. Eume. Brother, you look upon my fortunes with a scornful and A troubled eye, but from your soft temper (Most illustrious Madam) I expect Much more then I deserve, a courteous joy For all I dare possess; since what I am Your patience onely can allow, and what I have I prostrate at your feet. Kneels. Queen. Eumena, you deject your self too much, it is my turn To kneel, that am a suitor to you. She lifts her up. Eume. Forbid (just Heaven) such misbecoming sights, And give me your forgiveness too, if I Demand the cause of this attire, that hides More sanctity within, then it presents without. Queen. I dare not trust my griefs to my own tongue; For so, my patience would be injur'd much, By narrowly expressing what I bear; Your noble Brother, justly may assume My office of complaint, since he hath ta'en Most charitable pains in my redress. Ora. Eumena, happy wert thou in thy ignorance, Could not thy guilt soon prompt thee how to know What I am weary to express: The most renow'd Of all her sex, stands here divided from Her royal Lord, that sacred knot untied, By which the righteous have been taught to Think she grew unto his heart; another sad Example that might match the fate of this, Would damn the World; for we should willingly Believe Religion were no more then form. Eume. You powers that are so loth to be discern'd Appear a while to sence, and let them know If it be just, that I should be accus'd For what your selves ordain. Ora. Live still triumphant in the Court, Flatter thy beauty with presuming hope, It ne'er shall fade; think nature onely weak (And subject to decay) in Trees, and Flowers; As if thy Spring could last without her help, Whil'st this great Type of vertuous Love, (That vainly is, what others ne'er can imitate) Retires into a shade, cloister'd i'th' dark With holy Nuns, hiding her eyes from all Those shining glories, which th'ambitious seek Till they are blind. Eume. O let me wear that solemn Weed, And (Madam) stay you here to mend what is Amiss. Why should you live in a Monastick Cell? The vertuous need no pattern, since they are Already what the chief should be, let me Make trial of that dress. Ora. Would you invest your self, i'th' ornaments Of pious Maids. 'Lass! Vain Sister, that were To cozen Heaven, as you have cozen'd her. Eume. Madam, I'll turn me from that cruel Man, And sigh away my Soul, if what he says, Hath any leave from your consent. Queen. Your love to me is so injurious (Oramont) I dare not trust it, till you know The error of your thoughts; forgive him (fair Eumena) and so often too, as you At last may purchase Heaven by pard'ning him. Ora. What Angel but her self, could ever Have such mercy, and such wrongs at once. Queen. Rest sure, this solitary shape is not In envious anger worn, because The King continues constant to your love, Your meritorious Beauty had the fate To be his first kind choice; he does you right, And me no injury, to let that love Continue growing where it first took root. Yet I could wish I ne'er had seen his face, Or my affection could pursue it less, Since both my passion, and the object were Ordain'd to meet too late. Eume. Let me reclaim your purpose with my tears, Leave not the Court: What resolution can The King assume, but such a strength of vertue May in time subdue? Queen. It were unlawful hope, since then He needs must heap discourtesies on you. Ora. Wonder of Women! and my Souls delight! Queen. Enjoy (Eumena) what thou dost possess, The King! the King! A blessing so Supream, That I have oft rebuk'd th'ambition of Desire, when I did dream, that he was mine. Eume. O misery of Sence! we are inforc'd to hear And feel, without the licence of our Will. Queen. This I request, when happier hours shall give Your Beauty, more especial Grace, you would Entreat him, I may keep my holy Calling still, And from my Dowre he would allow So much of's useless treasure, as may build A little Covent, where the Virgin Sisterhood, And I, may with our Prayers expiate The sin against our marriage vow, which he Unwillingly comits. Oramont takes Eumena aside. Ora. If those be penetential tears, weep on. Thou shalt behold poor Oramont no more; For our dear Mothers sake, that prais'd thee with Her dying tongue, and bless'd us with her last Cold breath, I will not do thee so much wrong To wish these sorrows short, or thy life long Exeunt Oramont and Queen. Eume. Must my intire, and lasting innocence Be still rewarded with a curse, and from A noble Brother too, whose jealousie Can ne'er be cur'd, but by my vow'd Perpetual absence from the Court, which is A remedy that will destroy the King. Enter Amadore. Amad. This is her Chamber sure! I watch'd with heed, if The Queen and Oramont in their return Took not their straight immediate way from Hence; I'll make the door secure To hinder all access— Eume. What are you Sir, that rudely press to so reserv'd a place. Ama. With wise intent did Oramont detain Me still from seeing her. She looks as she Were made to conquer or betray— Eume. Why do you gaze with such amazement Sir? Come you t'admire? Or scornfully to kill what you behold? Amad. T'instruct you who I am, Know I am proud to Call my self the friend to Oramont. Eume. Was't he that sent you hither? Amad. No Lady (by my own contrivance) I come resolv'd, through all the dangers death Can minister, to find you here; friendship Hath given my Resolution strength to meet Even that, which overcame the valiant King, Your Beauties force. Eume. Discover quickly your intents; Ere fear distracts my understanding so, That I shall suffer, and not know the cause. Amad. Your Brother thinks your youth defil'd, which breeds Such a distemper in his Brest, that now His stronger Sences yield to ev'ry doubt. This melancholly sickness I would cure, And can invent no means, so fully fraught With hope, as to convey you from the Court In this disguise— Eume. Stay. Whither would you lead me Sir? I dare Not trust my self to furious men: To me you are a stranger, and may feign The story of that cause which tempts you so Untivilly to gain my Brothers love; take heed! If you abuse the Royal Priviledge That guards this place, an army call'd To your defence, cannot secure your life. Amad. Danger's a vain, unbody'd blast; let it Prevail with Infants often frighted in Their sleep; with Judges grown effeminate In their warm Furrs; who think most fearfully. Of death, because 'tis terrible to those Whom they condemn; with Priests, who at Their frequent visits, find the sickly in Despair, that hourly see the guilty die, And by uncertain faith, derive at last Their fears unto themselves. To such As these preach danger, but to me it is The musick of the Drum, ordain'd to fright Cowards, but gives the valiant appetite. Eume. Is there no help, but what with unprepar'd Devotion, rudely I must call from Heaven. Amad. Delay me not in hope of a surprise, But strait put on this borrow'd shape, and then With silence follow me, or on thy heart My Sword shall spoil the figure of the King. Draws his Sword. Eume. Did I believe, that dying is the worst You would inforce, I should invite it now. Kill her—that is most willingly prepar'd. Amad. Have you the vanity to be believ'd So innocent, as that you fear not death Eume. Sir, if you think I borrow vertue for A safe disguise, here I present my Brest. Amad. Assemble all your thoughts together, and Consult within; are there no terrors near The Grave? No angry Spirits, whose Imployment is to hurry, and transmit the Soul From flame to flame, from wind to wind (Poor Vex'd and weary stranger?) till groaning With the burden of its long remembred sins, Shall wish that its too soon forsaken flesh Were on again. Eume. I cannot think of any willing crime, I e'er committed, that may make me fear I shall be troubled after death. Amad. Yet study more; perhaps I have Defac'd your memory, with the disorder that My threats have made. Eume. 'Tis you are guilty Sir, and may suspect The confidence you brought, not what you Find in me; besides my innocence, I have So many griefs, as may declare I am Willing enough to die; begin that work, You thought you could so quickly finish with your sword. Amad. Thou but pretendst this vertuous boldness to Beguile my wrath, receive the just reward That such hypocrisie provokes. Eume. What interrupts you now, why are you slow To execute, what you did promise with such eager haste. Amad. Then she is clear, and I am lost, betray'd, And by the easiness of friendship wrought, Basely to place suspitions on a Saint. Upon my knee, I beg, you by Your hasty pardon, would prevent that curse, That black dishonor, which your Brothers Jealousie might lay upon your sex. Knocking at the Door. Eume. Hide, hide your self, if you desire to live, Perchance it is the King. Amad. He comes most timely then; for had I power, I would command him here. If life will satisfie th'arrears of guilt, Take it (who e'er thou art) for I will let Thee in? Opens the Door. Enter King. King. This (Mistress) is a pretty needless safety, D'you guard your door with Bolts? Hah! Amadore! That gave to Oramont his ransome, with Such brave munificence. Eume. Was he the Author of my Brothers liberty, Then I shall more lament his loss. King. How Sir! Your Sword naked, as 'twere drawn For violent designs! If treacherously It aims at me, thou shalt have cause to praise My valor more, then thou dost fear the King. I will not call for help, but thus unarm'd I dare resist a Traytors force. Amad. Had I not wrong'd that Lady, Sir, with most Unworthy doubts, then (free from guilt) I Should have boldness to encounter all assaults, Though num'rously address'd; but as I am Th'abuser of her fame, I weakly yield My weapon to your hand, revenge her cause, Whom you so nobly love. Kneels, and gives his Sword. Eume. How strangely he becomes this penitence! O Sir, believe him not, distraction makes Him own a crime, which he did ne'er commit. King. Eumena, he is safe; thou shouldst not think I'll vanquish him That overcomes himself; yet it Is just, I give him to the tryal of The Laws: for ev'ry circumstance denotes There is some great rash injury, which sure Thy goodness labors to conceal. Amad. If your strict Laws could punish me with death, For saucily infringing thus the Peace, And secret quiet of your Court, I then Would chearfully commend the doom. Emue. For my sake pity (Sir) his madness 'gainst Himself: Shall he that made my Brother free, Be fetter'd and confin'd in Bonds? Amad. My vile subjection grows more hideous to my sence. King takes Eumena aside. King. Those little Forms that bring authority Regardful law, and keep it great, should still Be sullen and severe; 'tis not with Kings (Eumena) as with lesser Men, that may In gentle courtesie forgive; for if The Lord of Laws should complement With Crimes, the Law it self that makes him safe, Would be but ceremony thought, and get No more regard, then as 'tis eloquently writ Or spoke; believ't, 'tis fit he suffer for Example onely, to deter the bad. Eume. Have you not said, I ne'er should be deny'd? King. Y'are wondrous fond of Men that do you wrong: Is this deriv'd from pity, or from love? Eume. There is no pity (Sir) if it be meant For benefit, and use, but hath Some little rellish in't of love. King. Thou never wert too kind till now. There Sir; Take back your weapon and be gone, but no Return of words. Reserve your thanks, 'Cause it belongs to her; and you may guess (Without offence) that I am loth to hear She doth oblige another more then me. Amad. This favor I would ne'er receive, Were not I secretly resolv'd to merit it. Exit Amadore. King. Eumena, you are merciful to all Beneath your self: O that I were no King, If thy affection onely can discend, Eume. Why should old weary Time run on, and make The World continue that deserves to cease, Since ev'ry vertue now grows dangerous; Can you be jealous of my mercy, Sir? King. Farewel neglectful Maid; how long have I Endur'd those narrow payments of thy love, For mine (bestow'd with such excess) and in A dull surmise, thou couldst not love at all? But I (alass) was ignorant of thee, As Men have ever been of things Most excellent, making such judgment on Thy Beauty, as Astronomers on Stars; Who, when their better use they could not know, Believ'd that they were onely made for show. Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter Oramont, Amadore, severally. Amadore. Amongst the numberless affairs of life, Not one can I remember that so much Concerns my happiness, as now to find Thee Oramont. Ora. Inspir'd, thou dost foretel a joy From the resentment of thy Soul: For sure I am the first can give it to thy sence. The Queen with soft appliances of love, Is sent for by her Royal Lord. Men hope He will invite her to his Bed. Ama. This is a joy indeed! The noble are Inclin'd to gladness, when the vertuous taste The just reward of their deserts. Ora. Methinks thou dost but temperately Receive, what thou shouldst hastily devour. Know, by his kind command, sh'ath laid aside The holy Robes; and now appears as she Already did possess, what onely expectation Yet can boast to have. Amad. Thou hast declar'd enough to make me think The Destinies have careful been of her, Though not of thee, unlucky friend: Thy jealousies Betray'd me to such false ignoble doubts, As must undo us both; for the abuse Of Ladies honors, never can be satisfied With penitence, but Blood. Ora. What means my Friend? Amad. To chastise thee, for those unmanly, and Too curious fears, that so have sulli'd the Most fair complexion of thy Sisters fame. Ora. Thou hast but nam'd her Amadore, And I already feel, a deadly weight upon My heart, not 'cause I think my forward faith Hath wrong'd her vertue with mistakes, but That I find, it is with Reasons help, too well Assur'd of her defects. Amad. Thy reason is but circumstantial, False as a cowards fear, which multiplies Each danger, that he would not meet until It grows into impossibilities. Thy Sister I Have seen, and know her to be pure, as first Created light, new spreding Buds, and Flowers Ne'er handled in their growth, are not More innocently sweet: How fierce will then My anger prove, when 'tis not onely exercis'd In a revenge for that foul heresie, With which thou didst infect my Soul, but 'Cause it took all quiet Peace from hers. Ora. With what Prophetick care, I fain would have Preserv'd thee from her eyes. Now thou hast Seen her, all the power of humane art cannot Redeem thee from her charms. She hath Bewitch'd thee to a doating love, and told thee Tales as void of truth, as those which Syrens sing, When listning Seamen perish in the Flood, For what they foolishly believ'd. Amad. Can I hear this! Shall I maintain fond Patience at such great Expence of my vex'd spirits, carelesly T'incourage other Men to slander her, Whose pitty did redeem me from just bonds: Advance thy Sword. Draws. Ora. Stay Amadore; I knew not that she Gave thee liberty, but that thou gavest me Mine, my memory doth now confess with so Much gratitude, I cannot be provoked T'attempt thy life. Amad. Heavens! Why did you make me kind? If to do good, draws on the consequence Of doing ill, because I did procure Thy liberty, am I oblig'd to take A ceremonious gratitude for thy Offence; forgiving all thy Sisters wrongs, And those low jealousies did force from me. Prepare— Ora. The furious winds are not More senceless in a storm. What reputation will Thy anger have, when it proceeds without Dispute, not staying for the usual credit of A cause. I shall believe th'ast none, unless Discourse, and Reason give't authority. Amad. To tell thee what I saw, or what Eumena said, were strait to lose the brave Just cause of my revenge; for then I know thou wouldst repent. Ora. I will not fight. Amad. O Fates! What poor unworthy enemies Do you provide for me, Coward? Thy former Sins shall unregarded pass, compar'd to this; For now thou wilt commit strange sacriledge, Steal from th'hearse of thy great Ancestor All his victorious wreaths, and blast 'em with The venome of a word. Oramont draws. Ora. The Seals of Friendship are broken now—Let's not Destroy our selves, like vain fantastick fools, Thus in the publick view, but follow till I lead Thee near a Grove; and though too late, thou shalt Be taught, how soon thy angers flame will die, Fed by the false fire of Eumena's eye. Exeunt. Enter Aleran, Saladine, Thorello. Aler. This is the Queens Privy Chamber sure? I wonder 'tis so empty, when so great Disorders are at hand; each faction met In several crouds. Thor. 'Tis strange! As after ev'ry raging storm, Merchants and Mariners flock to th'Exchange, To hear what mischiefs done at Sea; so now (Methinks) the Politick, and those that would Be thought such; Men old in offices, and those Whose Infant hopes are newly crying out, 'Cause their Reversions have not pass'd the Seals; Nay, and loyers of either sex, should all meet Here, to scatter and to gather news— Enter Old Courtiers, picking their Teeth, and striking of Crums from their Skirts. Sal. Behold the Formal Antiquaries! It seems the Waiters Table's first broke loose. Aler. Now are they talking of Religion. Sal. No, we should hear 'em then; because, Men at a loss are ever loud. Thor. Th'are talking of our sudden change i'th' Court, Which he in the dapple Grey-Beard observes T'important use; for I dare warrant ye, He swears if this inversion hold, he will Recover by th'assistance of an old Record, at least—another Rabbit to Their second course. Sal. Pox, he can never do't? That Record has been sufficiently studi'd. Aler. Y'are in the right! Besides by a Decree Of the same date, they have lost the dry'd Sweet-Meats Due from his Highness Table, and 'tis thought Can ne'er reprieve 'em by Law. Enter Gartha and one Lady, who curtsie to Thorello, very low; then bow to the others, they to them. Thor. That's Gartha, Eumena's Woman, And that the Lady Olari; 'tis such a short Leg'd Hen, but her Chappeens (Sir) are so tall, That th'other day, Ustalfo playing with her, And thinking he had pinch'd her knee, Wonder'd at her patience; when all the while He held her by the Wood— Aler. Sure th'others very old. Sal. Who? Gartha! She is the best Annalist Of all the Back-stair, and the Lobby acts, In good Queen Joan's days, that is now extant. Gar. Is not that Thorello, a wit? 1 Lady. Yes; but he makes love, as loud, And tediously as Lawyers put the Case. What Call you it the Academick way; as if he Would dispute a wench out of her Maidenhead. Gar. Those Cavaliers (his friends) are wits too, Lord! How maidenly they sit before the great Ladies Whom they visit, as if their silence did Imply, 'twas Beauty struck 'em dumb. Enter Second Lady, who curtsies to all, but Saladine, they to her; then she sits on the Rushes, and takes out a Book to read. Thor. How coldly you salute your Mistress Saladine, I know by that you'll marry her; for 'tis A certain sign, those who embrace abroad, Do ever keep a sober distance here. Gar. 'Slight! How strangely she is dress'd to day? 1 Lady. She's prouder then a Favorites Mistress at A Mask: Last night, Gartha, she'd needs compare Her Flanders Peaks to mine: What think'st thou? Gar. Alass poor soul; it is a little mad! 1 Lady. Let us sit by her, and tell her A secret or two of ours, that we May hear all hers. Gar. No, she'll read to us in that Book, Till we grow madder then her self. 1 Lady. It is some Play. Gar. She's excellent at driving perfect Characters in Plays: The Poets bow To her, she is so critical. Enter Third Lady in white. 3 Lady. Signior Thorello! Thor. Your Creature, sweet Madam— 3 Lady. Sir, you perfume me with your Epethite, I fear you have not sent to Milan Yet, for th'Carkanet of Pearl Thor. Your Ladiship will make me languish Much by your distrust, since your commands My dispatches have been written twice. 3 Lady. Y'oblige me Sir. She goes to salute and talk with Gartha. Thor. Sure she is fasting yet; her breath's So strong, 'twould overcome a Bearward. Sal. But thou hast writ for the Pearl? Thor. The Devil I have. 3 Lady. Signior, I here there are fair Rubies there. Thor. By my next Letter, Madam, I'll take Care t'acquaint you with their size &amp; value— T'were good she'd bait on Lemmon Peels, Or eat Pastillies, before she comes abroad. 3 Lady. Gartha, these travel'd wits are good for nothing, But to lie Liegers here for Ladies toys. Why dost not thou employ 'em. Gar. For what Madam? 3 Lady. For Essences to Rome, Tweeses to Brussels, and for Fans to Paris. Make the Poor Souls write, they'll take it kindly. Gar. Troth, and I'll put 'em to't; your Ladiship must stand my friend, and tell 'em That I'll read their verses to the Queen. 3 Lady. Let me alone Wench: Is your Lady in the Gallery? Gar. I wait here, in that opinion Madam. Exit third Lady. These great Ladies when th'ave tasted Matrimony; grow so haughty; and think they Can fool others, as easily as their Husbands. Enter Radegond. Radeg. Ladies and Gentlemen, avoid the Room. Exeunt all but Radegond. Enter King. King. Have you by private order so contriv'd, That both in visits, and her passage through The Court, Eumena may perceive some general Neglect, as if my favor to her were declin'd. Radeg. I have been busie (Sir) in your command. King. And are the throngs of Suitors too (that at Her lodgings still address their hopes) forbid Attendance there. Radeg. All secretly dismiss'd. King. How does she take it Radegond? Radeg. As one that entertains the change, More with her wonder, then her grief. King. How vain is the revenge which Lovers 'gainst their Mistresses invent? Since Still themselves more suffer in't, then those Whom they afflict. Enter Phylenio and Queen. Phyle. Your Grace will much confirm your Happiness, if you can meet his proffer'd Kindness with such looks, as may declare your Discontents, are not so lasting as your love. King. Why (Madam) did you come at my request? Or, why did I desire your presence here? I want the common vertue of the poor, Such a reserv'd and fearful bashfulness, As makes indebted men asham'd to see Those that oblige them most. Queen. Are these the comforts that I sought With such believing haste? Sir, 'tis not safe To mock my misery, for so your errors must Derive themselves; not from necessity, But from your will; and when your hate Prolongs its growth, until it ripen to a scorn, I am not certain I shall have the pow'r to pardon it. King. Alass, mistake me not, Though I mistake my self; for I of late Have felt such strange disorders in my heart, That I can hardly find those thoughts, which I Would utter first. Queen. 'Twas ill that I was sent for Sir; Why did you cruelly command that we Should meet again; I am the hurtful cause Of that disease which governs in your mind; And till the cause be quite remov'd, there is No hope of cure— King. O stay! thou didst divest Thee from thy holy Ornaments at my Request, 'twas kindly done; not could I think It fit to bury so much excellence In unfrequented shades, stay here, and love me still. Queen. You make your serious invitation vain, Where you are sure of such a glad consent. King. But wilt thou give me leave to love? Queen. Else Sir I were unjust unto my self. King. Thy understanding is too slow, I Would have such a liberty as is not fit For me to ask, nor thee to grant. Seal me A licence for each choice, mine eyes shall make. Queen. There is no harm in love; your nicety Hath wrong'd us both. Peculiar and distinct Affections, are but small derived parts Of what we call the universal love; And universal love (undoubtedly) Must be the best, since 'tis ascrib'd to Heaven. Take Sir the freedom you desire. King. Shall I receive a bounty that must Needs undo the giver, and yet nothing add Unto the wealth of my content; for I am sure That Charter never can usurp upon Eumena's heart, begone: Some curse o'errules My nature, shouldst thou stay, I must again Invite thee to be wrong'd—Attend the Queen Exeunt King one way, Phylenio, Radegond, Queen another. Enter Oramont, Eumena. Eume. Sir, whether would you go With a wild look? You shift from place to Place, and move so fast, as if your steps Were hastned by your fears— Ora. I find a happy emptiness In all your lodgings now: What is become Of that gay croud of Flatterers, who did Attend your greatness here? Where be Your Suitors too? Are all dispatch'd? Y'have Been a courteous Favorite, and of your power, have made a noble use. Eume. Though you are come To scorn this sudden change, I dare (without Much sorrow) tell you Sir, the King hath eas'd Me of that weighty power, as fitter for His own judicious strength. And now this rich Division of his glorious Pallace looks, As sad and vacant as the place where some Great Prince's Herse is laid aside, until The Funeral day, there but a few kind servants Watch in dutious Form, and weep for Their dead Lord. Ora. Alass! What alteration's here! Good Heaven! How comes it faithful Lovers thus fall out? Eume. Not for my own sake (Oramont) but yours, I pitty that decay of courtesie And soft compassion which you still discover. Ora. Why, you mistake me sure, I am a wise Prophetick Courtier, and foresaw your fall Ere I did practise my neglect? But yet I may a little differ now from all My subtle friends, bred up in Pallaces; For like a dull unskilful follower Of Kings, I shall bestow a present on you, (A rich one too) when all your power is gone. Draws out a sword bloody. Eume. A Sword, and newly stain'd with Blood! Ora. That your amazement may increase, Eumena. You shall know this present is A Legacy sent from a lover at His last expence of breath; and by my Soul He was a valiant Lover, though his cause Made him unfortunate. Eume. What hath your jealous fury done? Ora. An act scarce worthy of my Fame, I but dispatch'd a dying man: For thy bewitching beauty with strange charms Had conquer'd, and destroy'd him ere I came To make a tryal of his strength; his name Was Amadore. Eume. My fears had in 'em too much cause, Sure he was slain in rescue of my honor. Ora. You best can tell his undertaking that Provok'd him to't, and would you hear't from me. Eume. O, I have heard too much! Thou bloody Harbenger of death, whose place And hasty business, is to take up Graves And Tombs, where thou dost coursly lodge Men more renown'd and valiant then thy self. Weeps. Ora. Weep'st thou for him? Eume. Young Amadore to all succeeding times shall live Eterniz'd by some Tragick Pen, whose Gentle numbers shall melt the most Obdurate men, when they shall hear the Miseries of love, whilst thou (the horror of The scene) shalt ne'er be mention'd, but to Change their pitty into rage. Ora. O heart! I've ever strove To keep thee firm, loyal to vertue, and Impartial to the World; yet now thou art Subdu'd with sorrow that proceeds from sin. For I'm constrain'd to grieve, when I behold Her mourn, although I know she lov'd him but Unlawfully, whom she laments; else why Did she employ his anger to revenge, My kind and careful jealousie. Eume. Thou hast proceeded to such dire extreams, That 'tis too late to let thee know thy error, And 'cause thou art my Brother, I am loth To hinder thee of that excuse, which ignorance May give, since th'ast no other shift to free Thee from eternal punishment. Ora. Her falshood shews so comely in Her sorrows dress, that if my judgment were Not strongly arm'd with Reasons force, I Should be fondly overcome. Enter Radegond, Phylenio, and Guard. Raged. He was observ'd to enter here. It is the Kings command, that you disarm, And strait imprison him i'th' Fort. The Guard seize on him. Phyle. What fate hath govern'd you to day, My Lord? The people that beheld your fight With Amadore, have with tumultuous rage Pursu'd you to the Pallace-Gate, report Him kill'd; his servants and his friends assembled with The noise, demand strict justice of the King. Ora. Convey me strait to darkness, or to death! What pleasure can I take i'th' use of light, Since it no more can bring unto my view, My friend alive, or my fair Sister true? Exeunt Phylenio, Oramont, and Guard. Eume. Let me intreat you Sir, to bring him Back, I've much to say, that may perswade him To a fitting penitence: Why are you deaf To my request? Or, how durst you presume T'infringe the Royal priviledge of Court, And force my Brother hence? Radeg. I'm sorry (Madam) you will shortly Find more alteration in the King, then yet You seem to know. What we have done, was in Obedience to his will. Exit. Eume. Then I shall feel too soon the sudden Want of power; for I no more must see thee Oramont, A word so fatal, and implies such sad Unlucky truth, that I did fear to utter it. If now thy spirit (noble Amadore) 'Mongst thy immortal new acquaintance has The leasure to attend my plaints, forgive Th'injustice my fond nature prompts me too, Since I must needs bewail a Brothers loss, Although that Brother was thy enemy. Enter King. King. Since Amadore is slain, though by the Rage of Oramont, which I lament so much, That should remembrance entertain it long ('Twould be my ruine too;) yet such A strange necessity my Stars impose Upon me now, that his lamented death Is all I've left, to give some means of life Unto my begger'd and half famish'd love; For if there be a room for love within Her Brest, he being gone, that did Inhabit there: Why should not I succeed? Eume. Are you here Sir, does it become a King to look upon affliction, and not strait Redress't? The poor Physitian is so nice I'th' honor of his science, that he ne'er Will visit dying men: As if he were Asham'd to look upon those inward wounds He hath not skill to cure. King. Eumena, I did think to use a while a lovers art, Returning harsh neglects for thine; but since Thy fortune doth afflict thee more then I Could do, I come to share, and lessen what Before I practis'd to augment. Eume. I fear you come too late; but if Y'are still a King, and still retain that lov'd Divinity to which the vertuous bow; subdue The wicked strait, by shewing now that power Which they so sawcily suspect; call back from His dark Grave, the valiant Amadore. King. You Angels take her sences to your care. 'Lass! What a strange request was this? As Much discourteous too, as 'tis impossible. She'ld have me fetch my rival from th'unknown Far distant shades, to take a new Possession of that love, which onely by His absence I can hope t'enjoy. Eume. If this exceed your high prerogative, I will descend to what your mercy can Perform, redeem my Brother from his bonds: For in a dearth of comforts, we are taught To be contented with the least. Why, by Severe command, did you surprise him here? And gave no priviledge unto that place Which you have often sanctifi'd with vows. King. Here I surprise him! No 'twas the Just Law; but who is he so rash, that can Desire to be a King? Since all the justice that We do, is father'd on the makers of Our Laws, and all their cruelty on us; Make much you greedy Monarchs of that Dignity, which with such toil in War You labor to attain, I'm weary of't: For like the Castle bearing Elephant, We groan beneath that load, which we support To guard and strengthen others, not our selves. And what a useless glory 'tis, to be the cheif Of Men, wanting the Charter to command A tender Ladies love. Eume. Strange remedies you bring unto The sick! You deaf'n those complaints you Came to hear, with louder of your own. Enter Queen. Queen. O mercy, mercy, Sir. Dare you derive Your attributes from Heaven, yet mercy want. By which, the wiser chiefly are content You should assume th'immortal power! King. Madam, methinke you sue too earnestly. Queen. Eumena, speak to him; for Oramont is now convey'd to suffer death, just Now, 'tis the Letter of the riggid Law. He that In Duel doth survive, must be destroy'd, Ere th'other, whom he slew, can be interr'd— Eume. Alass! what weak encouragement Have I to make requests on earth, when by my Griefs of late, I've cause to doubt my prayers Are not heard in Heaven, and ill it will become Me Sir (whilst I remember Amadore) To ask that mercy which (how ever) is most Fit for you to grant. King. A fond unskilful bargain I shall make If I exchange Justice (the Jewel that doth Most adorn my crown) for her uncertain love Which since she is so loth to promise, how Unwilling she will be to pay. Queen. Why Sir are you so slow, when Time and danger move so fast? King. The people (Madam) call for Justice, They wisely lov't; that is, are well content When it is us'd to punish those above Them, not themselves, rude and ill manner'd Are they to expect the valiant should be Sacrific'd not onely by the Fo abroad, to keep Them safe, but suffer publick death at home, When they are pleas'd to see a Tragick show, Yet since such valor is proscribed by Law, He needs must die. Queen. If valor be Proscrib'd, how wretched then will Ladies be Since they can onely find the valiant true. King. Madam, I confess, that old Coward Law, looks too severely on couragious youth; And know in regal skill I should connive At those disorders which the furious in Their growing spirits oft complain; for else The body of a state (effeminate With lasting peace) when a strange War shall Come, like Bodies natural (confirm'd by strict And quiet temperance) will want the benefit Which the use of small disorders bring, that Make each violent disease less new, and dangerous. Queen. Sir there is hope, your reason will Perswade your mercy now. King. I, but the people understand not this, For that dull croud (whom Kings through cursed fate Must please) will have all Laws observ'd, and They must stand, not 'cause th'are wise, but 'Cause th'are old. Enter Radegond. Radeg. The hour Sir is come, and Oramont Must suffer death, unless you cancel strait The written doom. Eume. How fatal Oramont Doth sound, when joyn'd with that severe word death? Be free and bounteous of your pardon Sir; She kneels. For 'tis the last request I ere shall make. King. Look on her Heaven! Since you are Molifi'd with such a pittious sight as this, I Hope my justice now would not be stil'd Divine, but rather humane tyranny. This Ring Unto the Provost bear, it shall suffice To make him know Eumena gives his prisoner life. Exit Radegond. Eume. May all the hours you have bestow'd on him, Be added unto that accompt which destiny Hath numbred for your royal Self. Queen. And may they prove so happy too, That you shall wish for immortality, More for a change of being, then a hope To better what y'enjoy on earth. King. Eumena, hold poor begging Priests, Assume the power to bless, and with devout Wishes, imaginary payment make Of what they really receiv'd, but I Will lay a nobler value on your gratitude, And look you should return (not for your Brothers life) but for my fervent passions that So long have courted your slow love. Eume. I am undone! For I have rais'd your expectation to Demands, that I can never satisfie; Sir, could my memory transgress so soon To lose the thought of Amadore; yet my Devoted heart so much adores The vertues of your Queen, that I shall ne'er By the temptations of your Crown, usurp That love, which is so justly due to her. King. Be careful of my inward peace, and Call those resolutions back, or else deny Them for a little space. Eume. My souls unalter'd truth, Confirms what I have said: But trust me you May take this comfort Sir, I'll not be more Unkind unto your matchless heart then to Mine own. Exit. King. So dying men receive vain comforts From those visitants they love, when they Perswade them to be patient at the loss of life, With saying they are mortal too, and mean T'endure the like calamity, as if To die were from good fellowship, from free Intent t'accompany departing friends, When such last courtesie proceeds not from Their will, but natures obstinate decree: So if she mourns, 'tis not through willing Kindness but constraint. Queen. Doubt not her kindness Sir, you saw her weep. King. 'Twas by compulsion of my great All conquering grief, not from her love, like Eyes that from a secret simpathy, Water and weep at others, when they Behold them sore, but (Madam) why your tears. Queen. These are but leading drops; the Showers are all behind, that I shall dedicate Unto the memory of your sad fate. King. Can you lament at my distress whom I have injur'd with worse neglects; or can You wish my sorrows remedy, when what I gain must be your loss. Queen. Sir, I shall claim no title to your Brest, but what my patience and affection can Deserve; he that did joyn our hands, did give Me but a formal interest, since to Eumena you dispos'd your heart, before We knew those sacred rites. King. Are you not weary of your vertue yet? Queen. Nor of your love unto my rival Sir; If it were low, and sinful love, I should Not think it worth my envy or my fear. If pure and noble (as my strictest faith Believes) it is too great, a treasure to Be made particular, and own'd by me Alone, since what is good doth still increase In merit of that name, by being most Communative. King. This doctrine (Madam) will Be new, and much unwelcome to your sex. Queen. True love, admits no jealousie; you Shall perceive it strait, for I will hasten to Eumena Sir, and wo in your behalf. King. Dare you employ your tongue against your self? Queen. Do not suspect me Sir, I shall Not lose, by what she gains: For since your Heart can have no peace, unless 'tis lodg'd Within her Brest, I will procure its entrance There with reason too, because I find My quiet only doth consist in yours. King. Leave me! had I not goodness, yet My pride would ne'er consent to be so far out Gone, in kind effects of love. See me no more Till thou canst hope to love me less, till I Have cancel'd this large debt, or can (at least) Find out a juster, and a nobler way Then to increase, that debt which I should pay. Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter Thorello, Saladine, Gartha, and one Lady. Thorello. W'have a Coach (Ladies) at the Palace Gate If you dare trust the treasure of your Beauties T'our charge, we'll visit Oramont i'th' Fort. Salad. Some o'th' good natur'd Statesmen Accuse the King for sending's pardon, and Think 'twas ill advis'd to disappoint the People, when they were all met for nothing, But to see him suffer. Thor. 'Faith since they came in courtesie To see't, Oramont had been a right Cavalier, Had he refus'd the pardon, and strait dy'd To prevent them from losing their labor. Gar. Lord! How they love to see a proper Man suffer? And when their wives come home, Each tells her husband he was like him: For he behav'd himself with such a Courtly courage at the Block. Salad. As he had been his own neat executioner, And put of's head with the same ceremony, As others do their Hats, right alamode. Thor. Your Cavalier doth handsomely Indeed; but 'tis not fit course fellows should Arrive at such a publick grace, and for no other Merit, but fighting o'duels. 1 Lady. The King, I hope, will let them Fight it out, and not permit the Laws should do 'Em th'honor to take notice of their quarrels. Salad. When Ladies take the pains to dress Themselves to see, and grace an executed Gallant, were it handsome a poor quarrelling Rascal should strait perk up in's place, Perhaps he'll die stoutly; but how? in base Old cloaths, foul linnen, and's face unshav'd, Is that a sight for Ladies. Enter Aleran and third Lady. Thor. Look there comes Aleran, and with Him your revolted Mistress. 3 Lady. That Gartha, Signior's strangely Impudent, she's playing in the Sun, whil'st her Poor Lady is weeping wet under a cloud. Aler. Pray advise her (Madam) she'll take it kindly. 3 Lady. How dost good Wench? Introth Thou look'st so temptingly, that I could e'en Kiss thee. The very corner of thine eye stoln Out of a Close-hood, would burn as much I think, as a Sun beam, contracted in a Glass. Gar. I protest (Madam) I am meerly Your Ladiships Glass, and reflect your looks, Those are rare Pendants; I dare say a present; Some travell'd lover's fool'd into a gift. 3 Lady. Prethee, who told thee of it? Thou hear'st all; but I mean to change 'em. Ustalfo says they wear slight Emrauds now in Venice, and being set transparant, they shew well— 1 Lady. W'are taking Coach to visit Oramont; has your Ladiship the leisure T'humble your self with so much charity? 3 Lady. You do me honor in your Invitation, I shall make the number more Unworthy by th'poor addition of my self. —Gartha! This Alari's a very fool; why Dost thou keep her company? Gar. I keep her (Madam) for intelligence, She's well acquainted with all the Court Matrons, that have the skill to drive out Marriages, and make the parties meet, she can Procure a Catalogue of all the rich young heirs. 3 Lady. Sweet, Madam, whether do you Go? Pray stand and talk with us— 1 Lady. Your Ladiships servant! 3 Lady. We shall have tedious conversation With those wits; they'll nothing but discourse Together of fine hard things, and ne'er Mind us— Aler. I bring a business for you Gentlemen, Would we were rid of our impertinent charge. Thor. Widows are not so troublesome to Their young husbands, when they relieve them With good council, instead of money; the Curse is, that they are chaste too. A very saucy Vertue in them; considering they cannot Make up our pleasure with handsomness. 3 Lady. Come Signiors! Shall we take Coach? Thor. Your pardon Ladies!—Nay, I beseech you. Saladine, you still usurp my place. Strive to lead 'em. Exeunt omnes. Enter King, Radegond, Phylenio. King. False, and unlucky are you all! Pretend great wisdom, till y'attain to dignity, And place, then strait supply't with empty Forms, austere, and rigid looks; by which Your age (made dreadful, with that power High office brings) begets you an unjust Esteem; or, if you have the skill to give safe Counsels to your King; when's judgment Is distress'd, y'are so unfortunate, I Ne'er can feel their use. Radeg. Sir, you mistake that power, which Onely we derive from yours. You never did Include in our Commission such a vaste Authority, to alter, or to govern love. Phyle. How should we rule Eumena (Sir) Whom you (depos'd by th'cruel tyranny of Love) must by constraint obey? or, if we could Prescribe to you, and with th'advice of reason Too, we dare not whilst your anger lasts. King. A curse Upon your mannerly o'er-civil fears! But you suspect it is not safe to speak, (The Statesman's cowardise) more dangerous To Kings intrench'd within their Thrones, Then are the dastard thoughts of Sentinels, That watch near Sconces and Redoubts; Who still afraid to give th'alarm (least being Heard, they should be first surpris'd) endanger Armies by that silence, when, like you, they Basely practise to secure themselves. Radeg. 'Tis better to be silent, Sir, then give Advice, that may bring us ruine, And give you no ease. Phyle. All thriving Arts, Kings are Content to own; but when good counsels Not succeed, their Ministers possess the blame. King. I thank your noble wisdom much, Y'are kindly natur'd in your Providence. With wholsome policy you are content To share the better Fame, and juster wealth Of my Prerogative, but not the envy that Misfortune joyns to it. Radeg. If your distemper, Sir, will needs Constrain us to reveal th'opinion we would Hide, let our obedience then excuse all that Our judgment wants. We think you ne'er can Have a free possession of Eumena's love, Unless your Queen consent to a divorce. Phyle. Nor is this such a hopeless remedy As doth consist in wishes, more then in A probable effect; for she hath so design'd Her love and life to your dispose, that she'll Undo her self, by giving what you ask. King. 'Tis well, y'have ta'en a worthy care Both of my quiet, and my fame! Make haste In your address unto the Queen; let her be Told I am prepar'd to visit her?—These are Exeunt Radegond, Phylenio. The righteous State-Physitians that attend On sickly Kings, prescribing unto us, As Nature to the hungry disease of Tygers, And of Wolves; when to preserve their lives, They feed on all the weak submitting herd. But how accurs'd would subjects be, were we Not born with far more vertue, then w'are taught? I'll make my Function lov'd, and rather die, Then ow my life to such a remedy. Exit. Enter Oramont and Queen. Queen. Was holy Fryer Albert here to day, Your Sisters Confessor? Ora. Madam, be hath In just obedience to your kind command, Unlock'd my friers secret brest, and laid It open to mine eyes, shew'd me her heart, Until my jealousie receiv'd a strong And certain cure; but though I have out-liv'd My doubts, my modesty (I hope) will not Permit me to survive my shame. Queen. In giving you (By her unweari'd intercession) life, She onely hath engag'd your gratitude: But rev'rend Albert, by revealing all Those truths, the priviledge of's function Makes him know, hath much oblig'd your faith. Ora. I am confirm'd! And though the peoples malice to her in Their talk, by general consent Made me so credulous; though my nice care (Still watchful to preserve a sisters honor) And my most dutious love of you, apt to Resent your wrongs, and then believing you Declar'd her chaste, more in your gentleness, Then your belief, though these apparant Pleas (Together urg'd) might prove me capable Of some excuse; yet I am loth to own Them least my guilt made less, I should be Thought t'avoid that punishment, which I've Resolv'd upon my self. Queen. Beware, such resolutions, Sir, are ill. Ora. Your Justice (Madam) would conceive them fit, Could you with my vex'd thoughts, peruse Those wrongs which I not onely did commit 'Gainst her, but 'gainst the King, and my Renowned friend, dead Amadore; and when I name him dead, I hardly can forbear that Fury to my self, by which I rashly ruin'd him. Queen. To be the unauthoriz'd Author of Your own strict punishment, would to your Crimes such foulness add, as never could be Wash'd away, with all the tears of penitence. Be govern'd by your better thoughts, and strait Prepare to follow me, you'll perfect a Design, to which I am importun'd by The secret suit of Aleran. Ora. I must not disobey you (Madam) Though I shall but make an ill exchange of This lov'd darkness, for that light I am Asham'd to see. Queen. My own distresses are so great, That I conceive them hopeless now of cure, But I will try to lessen yours. Ora. Her vertue is as restless as the Sun, Still moving, and yet never tir'd; and like His purer Beams, it comforts every thing. Exeunt. Enter Aleran, Thorello, Saladine. Thor. The Ladies are sullenly retir'd Into their Closets, there to meditate And study the perfection of new tires. Salad. They took it ill, that Oramont was So reserv'd, as to refuse their visit. Aler. Gallants, y'are here invited to the Funeral of Amadore. Sal. Had not your summons been too hasty, Sir, W'had put ourselves to th'charge of Blacks, For the solemnity; but we have borrowed all The sorrow we could get abroad which added To our own will shew as doleful as long cloaks. Aler. Well, you are high in my esteem, And you shall both confess't; that very secret Which this morn I whisper'd to the Queen, Shall now be yours, The party is alive. Sal. How! Amadore alive! Thor. This mirth is scarce becoming Aleran. Aler. It shall be when you find it truth, Attend and reverence this tongue of mine That hath contain'd it self so silently These two days. Thor. Dost thou grow serious. Aler. It was my luck t'arrive where those Great spirits fought, and just when Oramont Had left the field, in fear that he had kill'd His friend, there I beheld the conquer'd Amadore grasping his Mother Earth, And senceless with the loss of Blood; whilst Straight by the discovery of a few, a tide Of people rushing in, they carry'd him For dead unto my Garden-house that stood Upon the River side, it being luckily The next adjacent dwelling to that place. Sal. I hope this will proceed from wonder into joy. Aler. Your hope, Sir, will be satisfied, For with this violence of motion, I Discover'd life, and by some skilful help Retriev'd his wandring sences, till he got The power to speak; but they were words Of rage, most strangely vex'd: As soon as he Had strength to know that he was overcome, And when with all religious force we had Perswaded him not to disdain his cure, There being no impediment, but loss of blood, He was a while content, but did enjoyn Me to conceal his strange return to life. Thor. What might that imposition mean? Aler. I cannot guess, unless in melancholly Sence of that disgrace, he did resolve Perpetually to hide himself from men. Thor. If Oramont had miss'd his pardon, You would have been so good natur'd (Aleran) t'have mock'd the Law, by shewing Amadore alive. Aler. Introth, I think, I should, nor will I more obey his fond injunction now. Enter Amadore in a night Gown. For he'll relapse again for want of company; Look there, this shady walk contents him much. Thor. It will be happy news for Oramont. Sal. 'Tis like ere this, h'has heard it from the Queen. Amad. Sir, you have fail'd my trust. Aler. What I have done, my care and Reason will excuse; for such a solitude as this Would nourish your disease. These (Sir) whom I presume to make your Visitants, are my choice friends, that hold Your vertue and your honor in a high regard. Amad. Though I'm concern'd i'th' injury, Yet you have most abus'd these Gentlemen: Why have you made the valiant lose their Time so much to visit me, that by the falsness Of my courage was subdu'd, when I was Grac'd with such a noble Cause. Thor. This was your Fortunes weakness (Sir) not yours. Sal. And you would grow unjust unto your Self, to own the error of your fate. Amad. Fortune and Fate are meerly names, For were they real pow'rs, they'ld not indure, That fools should prove them guilty of our ills. Sal. Your passion makes you subject to mistake. Amad. 'Tis a sad truth, and no mistake of Rage, if every Star were guilty of those crimes, Of which so sev'rally they've been accus'd By th'long continu'd race of Erring men, They would have lost their hurtful influence Ere this, for the supream just power would Then neglect them. Enter Oramont, Aleran steps to whisper him. Ora. Sir, Heaven will soon reward your Noble care, those joys you would deliver me, The Queen already hath reveal'd. Aler. 'Twere fit you should delay your Visit Sir, I fear 'twill much distemper him! Ora. Trust my discretion, and dismiss your Friends. Exeunt all but Oramont and Amadore. Amad. My enemy! If I had any sence Of shame, I should believe it now as much Immodesty to live, as it was base Before to be subdu'd. Ora. Renowned Amadore! Whom, if not my merit, yet my intire Affection must call friend. Know, not by me, But by unlucky destiny, thou wert Subdu'd; so destiny became your enemy Not Oramont. Amad. A second curse is come upon me, Ere the first is gone! Wilt thou deprive me Of revenge, by courteous false denials of Thy act; expose me to repair my honor On a high mysterious power, that we onely Know by words, let me be hidden in a Grave! Ora. These sad complaints become you not. Amad. Why do you scorn me Sir? And When my honor's lost, so vainly shift me off, Thus to repair't upon immortal things? Why am I fool'd, by telling me, I'm overcome By some strange influence above? For in Disdain, you'ld bid me go and fight with Heaven now. Ora. Your valor, Sir, is misinform'd, and Your opinion weakly nice, to think the Conquer'd lose their honor with their swords, The noble sons of Pompey kept their honor When they lost the spacious World, and will Continue still as dear to Fame, as lucky Cesar That prevail'd; they gain'd by being overcome. For those that die, get instant immortality, Whilst victors that survive retard'd that Happiness which early dying, doth with Greater safety meet, because with fewer crimes. Amad. You come to tell me, that I should have dy'd Ora. Your anger still perverts my words. Amad. These are but vain sophistick toys, If thou art real Oramont, and hast some touch Of pitty left, Deprive me not of that Renown, which such a noble cause might gain Me, if 'twere manag'd with a prosperous arm. Ora. I understand not, what you would command. Amad. Be kind and gentle, as thou ever Wert, and fight with me again. Ora. Not for the wealth of both the Ladies, Or all the treasure that the Sea doth hide! I am reclaim'd, and with true inward grief, Repent my jealous thoughts. Amad. What will become of me? My honor's lost, and now I want a cause That justly might suffice me to redeem't? Be courteous yet! Could it be ever said Of Amadore, that he deny'd one, whom He stil'd his friend, th'imployment of his Sword, when's reputation was distress'd, The cause will yet stand good enough, Since I'm not bound so quickly to believe Your jealousies, are by your penitence absolv'd. Ora. You make a wonderful request! Retire a while within! Till I can secretly Provide to satisfie your will. Amad. All Blessings, but this victory be thine. Exeunt severally. Enter Oramont and Eumena. Ora. To say (Eumena) that my jealousie Sprung from my Love, and Rumor give It growth, were such fond circumstance, As both the Queen, and your Grave Confessor Already have confuted with severe Rebukes: Thy causless suff'rings have rais'd Thee to the dignity of Saints: Thus low I bow for my offence, which (since so great) If thou forgiv'st, it would be stil'd thy miracle, But that such wondrous mercy is the most Familiar custom of thy vertue. Eume. I must receive thee Oramont with Tears, although thy happy news of Amadore's Return to life, might well command my joys T'appear in a less doubtful shape. Ora. You have been told the temper of His soul; restore him by the soft Perswasions of your love. Where are you Sir? Enter Amadore. Amad. Eumena too! Is the great hope of Our brave Fierce encounter turn'd to this! Cruel and false! Dost thou present the object To my view, that will revert mine eyes, until They look upon my inward, hidden shame? Eume. Y'are too suspitious (valiant Amadore) of the condition of your Fame, Which since so precious unto all, you ne'er Can lose what others with such care preserve. My cause was dignifi'd in your attempt; and Though the noblest humane enterprise is still Uncertain of success; yet brave attempts Get th'estimation of most prosp'rous deeds. Amad. All that is good, the ill within me, Straight inverts to contrary effects; that which Would render life to Plants and Stones, doth Strike me dead; for I shall now be kil'd, Even with the musick of her voice. Eume. Make me not still unhappy. Amad. No Lady, I would have you keep Your kind compassion for a nobler use, then Thus to waste it upon me, though I did want The vigor to defend the justice of your cause, And could not be victorious then; yet you Shall find I can subdue my greatest hopes, Even those that aim'd at you. Exit. Ora. Eumena, follow him! unless thy love Can for immediate rescue, force a passage to His heart, he straight will ruine it. Eume. O, what a change is here! You That before set guards upon my modesty, Now think it fit the wooer should be Courted by the woo'd. Exeunt. Enter King, Queen, Radegond, Phylenio, and Attendants. King. Proclaim a lasting joy to all that love, Or are belov'd! Send 'em a bounteous share Of mine, I have enough to furnish either sex. I am so light that I could tread on growing Flowers, and never bend their stalks. Queen. My joy is such, that till this hour I never felt the like! And therefore Sir, you Needs must guess it is deriv'd from yours. King. Thy constant Vertue hath so Vanquish'd me, that all my rash Rebellious Flames grow pale and sickly now. Near ev'ry Beam thine eyes most carelesly do shed Tapers before the Sun at Noon, look Not so alter'd and eclips'd. Queen. Who is it, that will doubt The care of Heaven? Or think th'immortal Pow'rs are slow, because they take the Priviledge to chuse their own time, when they Will send their blessings down. King. Call all the Court, that they may Celebrate this miracle of love! And call Eumena too, that she may know how much Her wishes, and her Prayers for the Queen Have been observ'd above, I must believe They were devout, they have so well prevail'd. Enter Thorello, Saladine, Aleran. Radeg. Look Sir! Your joys are soon dispers'd. Phyle. Your voice is kingly too; for 'tis As soon obey'd, as it is heard. King. Do homage to your Queen; Not as she shares the titles of my Crown, But the Prerogatives of Love, whose Everlasting Throne is in my Brest. Aler. Our gladness shall appear in Triumphs, Sir! Sal. Such as the envious too shall come to See, delighted with the glory, though they Want the Vertue to affect the Cause. Enter Oramont, Amadore, Eumena. Thor. This Cupid's a strange fantastick Young Monsieur. King. What Magick show is this? Brave Amadore alive again? Queen. W'have kept a story for you Sir, That will contribute to your wonder and your Joy; reserve it for the triumphs of this night. Eume. Sir, to prolong a precious life, that Hath been sav'd by miracle, I was constrain'd A little to dispence with bashfulness, And woo a valiant lover to woo me. King. Were not my heart resolv'd Eumena To be still delighted here, where justly I Am taught to pay a mighty debt, long due For true affection, and her patient loyalty, I should hear this as a sad Tragick tale; But now, my kinder wish fall on you both. Eume. The strange continuance of your Vertuous love, my prayers and obedience, Shall requite, at first I durst not welcome it, More then with civil kindness and regard, Since there was no proportion 'tween my Fortunes and a King; but when it grew to Passionate excess, the Piety of your fair Queen, made me forbear t'usurp her interst. King. 'Twas fit thy goodness should receive Rewards from thy own choice. Now Oramont, Your causless jealousie will cease, and yours (Brave rival) I am sure will ne'er begin. Ora. Let me receive your pardon, Sir, In a forgetfulness of my fond crime. Amad. I'll beg it for him, Sir, as fervently As I emplore your favors on my self. Your sister shall be taught to chide you Oramont, though I'll no more lament your Victory, since I have gain'd my honors Hope in her. Queen. Be not dejected Oramont, your care Of me I shall requite; there's no choice, Your noble love can make in Italy, but I Will woo her to become your Bride. Ora. Madam, the War must be my Mistress Now, a long hard pennance I'll endure, Till I can expiate my sins of jealousie. King. Lead on (my Lords) that we may Straight prepare to celebrate Eumena's Nuptial Rites, mine now will be But happily renew'd This day, succeeding Lovers shall prefer To be the cheif in Loves new Kalender. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
