      <field name="fulltext">The prologue of the messenger. For as much as man is naturally prone, To euil from his youth, as scripture doth recite, gene. viii Iere xiiii Eccle. xxx It is necessary that he be spedely withdrawen, Frome concupiscence of syn, his naturall appetite, And ordre to bryng vp youth, Ecclesiasticus doth write, An vntamed horse, wyl be harde saith he, And a wanton chylde wilfull wyl be. Gyue hym no libertie in youth, nor hys foly excuse, Bowe doune his necke, and kepe him in good awe, Least he be stubburne: no laboure refuse, To trayne hym to wisedome, and teache him Gods lawe For youth is frayle and easy to draw (By grace (to goodnes: (by nature to yll: That nature hath ingrafted, is harde to kyll Neuertheles in youth men maye be best Trayned to vertue by godly mean Uice may be so mortified and so supprest That it shall not breake furth, yet ye roote will remayne: As in thys Enterlude by youth, you shall se playn: From his lust by good counsell, brought to godly c?uersation And shortly after to frayle natures inclination The enemy of mankind, Sathan through Hipocrisy Fayned or chosen holynes of mans blynd entent Forsakyn Gods word, that leadeth ryght way Is brought to felowshyp and vngracious company: To abhominable lyuing, til he be holy bent And so to desperation, if good counsel were not sent From God, that in trouble doth no man forsake That doth call, and trust in hym for Christes sake. Finally, youth by goddes special grace, Doth earnestly repent his abhominable lyuyng By the doctrine of good counsell, and to his solace Gods mercy entreth to hym recitinge: Gods merciful promises, as they be in writinge He beleueth and foloweth to his great consolacyon All these partes ye shal se brefly plaied in their fashi?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here entreth lusty Iuuentus, or youth singinge as foloweth. In a herber grene, a slope where as I laye The byrdes sang swete in the myddes of the daye I dreamed fast of myrth and play In youth is pleasur, in youth is pleasure. Me thought I walked stil to and fro And from her company I could not go But when I waked it was not so, In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure. Therfore my harte is surel ypyght. Of her alone to haue a sight. Whiche is my ioy and hartes delyght, In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure. Finis. Lusty iuuentus or youth, he speaketh. What how are they not here? I am disapoynted by the blessed masse, I had thought to haue founde them makyng good chere But now they are gone to some secrte place. Uel seing they are gone, I do not greatly passe. Another tyme I will holde them as much, Seinge they brake promise, and kepe not the tweche. What shal I do now to passe a waye the daye Is there any man here that will go to game. At what so euer ye wil play To make one, I am redy to the same: youth ful of pleasure is my propre name To be alone is not my appetyte. For of all thynges in th world I loue merey compani Who knoweth where is ere a mynstrel, By the masse I would fayne go daunce a fit My compacions are at it I know right well They do not all this whyle in a corner sit: Agaynste another tyme they haue taught my wyt I beshrew their hartes for seruing me this. I will go seke them, whether I hyt or mysse. Here entreth god counsell. To wh? iouth yet speaketh. Well I met father, well I met, Did you heare any minstrels playe? As you cam hitherwarde vpon your way, And yf you did I pray you wyshe me theither For I am goyng to seke th?, &amp; in fayth I know not whether Good co?sell. Syr I will aske you a question by your fauour what would you with the minstrell do? Iuuentus. Nothyng but haue a daunce or two, To passe the tyme away in pleasure, Good co?sell. If that be the matter, I promyse you sure I am the more soryer that it should so be, For there is no such passing, ye tyme a poynted in ye scrypture Nor yet therunto it doth not a gre, I wyshe that ye would so vse your libertie, To walke as you are bound to do, Accordyng to the vocati?, whych god hath called you to, Iuuentus. Why syr, are you angry because I haue spoken so By the masse it is alone for my apety Good counsell Shewe me your name I praye you hertely And then I will my minde expresse Iuuentus. My name is called Iuuentus doutles Say what you will I will geue you the hearinge. Good counsel. For as much as god hath created you of nothing, Unto his owne lyknes, by spirituall illuminacion, It is vnmete that ye should leade your lyuinge Contrary to hys godly determynacyon, Sainct Paul vnto ye Ephesians geueth good exhortaci? Saying, walke circumspectly, redeming the tyme That is to sp?d it well, &amp; not to wickednes enclyne Iuuentus. No, no, hardely none of myne, If I wold lyue so straight, you might co?t me a foole Let them kepe thouse rules, whiche are doctours diuine And haue be brought vp all theyr dayes in scole. Good counsell Moyses in the lawe exhorteth his people, As in the boke of Deutronomye he doth playnly wryte, That they should lyue obedyent and thankefull, For infecte these wordes he doth resyte: All ye this day stand before the Lordes syght, Both princes, rulers, elders and parentes, Chyldr? wiues, yong &amp; olde, therfore obey his comma?dem?ts Iuuentus. I am to yong to vnderstand his documents, Wherfore did all they stand before his presence? Good counsell To entre with God peace and aliaunce, Promysing that they woulde him honour, feare &amp; serue All kynde of people were bounde in those couenauntes, That from his lawe they shuld neuer swarue, For God vseth no percialitie. Iuuentus. What? am I bound as wel as the cleargy, To learne and follow his preceptes and lawe? Good counsell Ye surely, or els God wil withdrawe Hys mercy from you, promysed in his couenaunt, For except you lyue vnder hys obedience and awe, How can you receue the benyfites of his testament? For he submetteth hymselfe to be a seruaunt, And his masters comma?dem?t wyl not fulfil nor regard According as he hath done, is worthy hys reward. Iuuentus. It is as true a sayng as euer I heard, Therfore your name I pray now tell, For by my truth your c?munication I like wondres wel Good counsell My name is called good counsell, iuu?tus Good counsel, Now in fayth I cry you mercy, I am sory that I haue you thus offended, But I pray you beare with me paciently, And my misse behaueour shalbe amended, I know my tyme I haue rudely spended, Folowinge my awne lust, beinge led bi ignoraunce. But nowe I hope of better knowledge through your aquayntaunce. Good counsell I praye God guide you with hys gracyous assistans Unto ye knowlege of hys truth, your ignoraunce to vndo That you may be one of those numbred christians Which foloweth the lambe whether he doth go, The lambe Iesus Christ, my meanynge is so, By sure fayth &amp; confidence, in his bitter death &amp; passion, The onely pryce of oure health and saluacyon. iuu?tus Syr, I thanke you for youre harty oracion And now I praye you shewe me your aduisemet Howe I maye lyue in this my vocation, Accordyng to Godds will and commaundement. Good counsell Fyrst of all it is moste expedient. That you exercyse your selfe in continual prayer, That it might please the Lorde omnipotente, To send vnto you his holi spirit and comforter: Whiche will leade you euery daye and houre Unto the knowledge of hys worde and verytie Where in you may learne to lyue most christianly. iuu?tus heeuelith O Lord graunt me of thy infinite mercy, The true knowledge of the lawe and wil, And illumine my hart with spirit continually That I way be apte thy holy preceptes to fulfyl: Strengthen me, that I maye parseuer stil. Thy commaundementes to obaye. And then shal I neuer slip nor fal away, he riseth. Ful true be these wordes, which Christ hym self did saye He that seketh shal surely fynde. Good counsell Be holde youth now reioyce we may For I se knowledge of God, verite stand here behinde He is come now to satisfey your mynde In those thynges which you will desire, Therfore together let vs approche him nere. Iuuentus. A good counsyl, new it doth appere. That god neuer reiecteth the humbles petycion. Knowledge, Now ye Lord blesse you al Wt his heau?ly benedyctyon, And with his fyery loue your harts enflame That of hys mercyful promyses you may haue ye fruity? The subtiltie, of the deuel, vtterly to defame: Nou good christian audience, I will expresse mi name The true knowledge of gods veritie. thus mi name doth hyghte, Whom God hath appointed, to geue ye blind their syght. Good councell All prase be geuen to that Lord of myght, which hath appoynted you hether at thys present houre For I trust you wil so instruct youth a right, That he shal liue accordyng to Gods pleasure Iuuentus And I thanke Iesus Christ my sauiour, That he ys come to my company. Knowledge. I thanke you my frendes most harteli For your gentyll salutacion. Iuuentus. Syr, I wil be so bolde by your delyberation To opyn my mind vnto you now, Trustynge that bi your good exhortacyon, I shall learne those thynges, which I neuer knew: This one thynge chiefly I woulde learne of you How I maye my lyfe in thes my vocacyon leade. Accordynge as God hath ordeyned and decrede, Knowledge The prophet Dauid saith: that the man is blessed, Which doth excersise hym selfe in the lawe of the Lorde, And doth not folow the way of the wickid, As the fyrst psalme doth playnly accorde: The foure score &amp; .xiii. psalmes therunto dothe accorde. Blessed is the man whome thou teachest, o Lord sayth he To learne the law, precepts, worde or verytie And Christ in the Gospel sayth manifestly. Blessed is he which heareth ye worde of god ?d kepeth it, That is to beleue hys word, &amp; lyue accordingly Declaryng the fayth by the fruytes of the spirit Whose frutes are these, as s. Paul to ye Gal, doth wrighte Loue ioie, peace, long suffring and faithfulnes Mekenes, goodnes, temperaunce and gentilnes Good counsell Be these wordes which vnto you he doth expresse He teacheth that you ought to haue a stedfast faith With out it is impossible doutlesse, To please god, as sainct Paul sayth: Where fayth is not, godly lyuing decaieth For whatsoeuer is not of fayth, sayth.s.Paul, is synne, But where a perfite faith is, there is good working Iuuentus It semeth to me that this your meanyng, That wh? I obserue gods comma?dem?tes &amp; ye workes of charyte They shall preuayl vnto me nothyng, Except I beleue to be saued therby. Knowledge. No, no, you are deceyued very blyndly, for fayth in Christes merites dothe onely iustyfy, And make vs righteous in goddes sight Iuuentus. Why should I then in Good workes delight? Seing I shal not be saued by them Good counsel. Becausy they are required of al christian men, As the necessary fruites of true repentaunce. Knowledge, But the reward of the heauenli inheritaunce Is geuen vs through faith, for Christes deseruinges, As.s Paule declareth in ye .iiii. chapter to the Romayns therfore we ought not to worke as hierlinges: Seing Christ hath purged vs once from al our wicked lyuing. Let vs no more wallow therin, But perseuer like good bra?ches, bearing frute in hym. Iuuentus Now I know where about you haue bene. My elders neuer taught me so before. Good councell Though your elders wer blynd, dout not you therfore For sainct Peter sayth, vaine is the conuersations, Whiche ye receyue by your elders traditions, Iuuentus. I wyll gladly receyue your godly admonicions, But yet I praye you shewe me the cause, that they being men of great discretions Did not instructe me in gods lawes, According to hys will and ordinaunce Knowledge. Because they th? selfes were wrapped in ignoraunce Being deceyued by false preachers. Iuuentus. O Lord deliuer me from wicked teachers, That I be not deceyued with theyr false doctrine. Good counsell to Gods word you must onely encline, Al other doctrine cleane set a parte. Iuuentus. Surely that I will from the bottom of my heart, And I th?ke ye liuing God whyth hath geuen me ye knowledge To know hys doctryng fr? the false &amp; peruarce I being yet yonge and full tender of age: And that he hath made me partaker of ye heauenly in heritage Of his one mercy and not of my deseruynge For hell I haue decerued by my synfull workyng. I know right well my elders and parentes. Haue of a longe tyme deceuid be, With blynd hypocrisy and supersticious ententes, Trusting in theyr owne workes, which is nothynge but vanyte Their steppes shall not be folowed for me, Therfore I pray you shew me a briefe conclusyon, How I oughte to lyue in chrystian religion. Knowledge. The first begyning of wysd?, as sayth ye wise Salomon Is to feare God with al they harte and power And th? yu must beleue al his promise Wtout any exception And that he will performe th? both c?stant &amp; sure And then be cause he is thy only sauiour Thou must loue hym with all thy soule and mynde And thy neybour as thyself, because he hath so assyned, Iuuentus. To loue my neybour as my self, I c? not be to kynde I pray you tell me, what meane you Knowledge. My meanyng is as Chryste sayth in ye .vi. chap. Math. To do to hym as you woulde be done to Iuuentus. I pray God geue me grace so for to do That vnto hys wil I maye be obedyent. Good counsell Here you shall reseaue Christes testament To comfort your consience when nede shal requyre To learne the contentes there of, se that you be dilygent The which all chrystian men ought to desyre For it is the wel, or fountayne moste clere Out of the which doth spryng swete consolacyon To all those that thyrst after eternal saluacyon. Knowledge. Ther in shal you fynde most holsome presaruacion Both in troubles, percicucions, sicknes ?d aduersytye And a sure defence in the time of temptacyon Agaynst whom ye deuel can not preuayle Wt all his army: And if you perseuer therin vnfaynedly It wyl set your hart at suche quietnes and rest Which can not neuer be turned with stormes nor tempest Good counsell With this thyng you must neyther flatter nor iest But stedfastly beleue it euery day and houre And let youre conuersacyon op?ly protest That of your hart it is ye most precious treasure And then your godly example shal other men procure To learne and exercyse the same also I praye God strengthen you so for to do Iuuentus Now for this godly knowledge, whych you haue brought me to I beseche the lyuynge God reward you agayn From your company I wyl neuer departe nor go So longe as in thys lyfe I do remayne: For in thys boke I se manyfest and playne That he that foloweth hys owne lustes &amp; imagynacyon Kepeth the ready path to euerlast dampnacyon. And he that leadete a godly conuersacyon Shal be borught to suche quietnes, ioy and peace Which in comparison passeth all worldly gloriation Whiche con not endure, but shortly cease Both the time and houre I may now blesse That I met with you father good councel to bryng me to the knowledge of his heueuenly Gospel Knowledge. This your profession I like veri wel So that you entend to lyue accordyng I praye God your lyuing do not rebell But euer agre vnto your sayng That when ye shal make acountes or rekening Of thys talent, whych you haue receued you may be one of those, Wt whom ye Lord shalbe pleased Good councell For thys c?uersacion of youth, ye lords nam be prased Let vs now departe for a ceason. Exit Knowledge, To geue God the glori it is conuenient and reason yf thou will depart, I will not tary. Exit Iuuentus. And I wil neuer forsake your company Whyle I lyue in thys world Here entreth the Deuel, Oh oh all to late I trow thys geare wil come to naught For I perceyue my powre doth a bate For al the policie that euer I haue wrought, Many and sundry wayes I haue sought, To haue the word of god deluded vtterly, Oh for sorow yet it will not be. I haue done the best that I can, And my ministers also in euery place, to rote it clene from the hart of man, And yet for all that it florisheth a pace: I am sore in drede to shew my face, My auctoritie and workes are so greatly dyspysed My inuentions, and all that euer I haue deuised Oh oh, ful well I know the cause, that my estimacion doth thus decay, the olde people woulde beleue stil in my lawes, But the yonger sort leade them a contrary way they wyl not beleue they playnly say, In olde traditions and made by men, But they wil lyue as the scripture teacheth th?. Out I crye vpon them, they do me open wr?g, to bring vp their chyldren thus in knowlage, For if they wil not folow my wayes wh? thei are yong yt is harde turning them when they come to age: I must nedes fynd some meanes this matter to swage, I meane to turn theyr hartes from the scripture quite, that in carnal pleasurs they may haue more delyght. Wel I wil go taste to enfect this youth through the entisement of my sonne hypocrysie, And worke some proper feate to stope his mouth that he may lede hys lyfe carnally: I had neuer more nede my matters to apply, Oh my chyld hypocrisie, where art thou? I charge ye of my blessing, apeare before me now Oh oh quod ha, kepe agayne the sowe, Here entreth hypocrysie. Hipocrysye. I come as faste as I can, I warrant you, Where is he that hath the sowe to sell? I wil geue hym money yf I lyke her well, wether it be sowe or hogge, I do not greatly care For by my occupacion I am a bochare, Deuell. Oh my chylde, how doest thou fare? Hipocrysye Sancti amen, who haue we there? By the masse I wyl bye none of thy ware, thou arte a chapman for the deuell Deuell. What my sonne, canst thou not tell? Who is here, and what I am, I am thyne owne father Sathan. Hipocrycye. Be you so syr? I crye you mercy than, you may say I am homely, &amp; lacke learnyng, to lyken my fathers voyce vnto a sowes groning But I pray you shew me the cause, and why that you called me hether so hastely, Deuell. A Hypocrisie, I am vndone vtterly Hipocrysye. Utterly vndone, nay stop there hardely, For I my selfe do know the contrary, By dayly experience: Do not I yet raygne a brode, And as longe as I am in the worlde, you haue some treasure and substaunce. I suppose I haue ben the flower In settyng forth thy lawes and power, Without any delay By the masse if I had not bene, thou haddest not ben worth a flaunders pin, At thys present daye. the tyme were to long nowe to declare How many and great the number are, Whiche haue deceyued be: And brought cleane from Gods lawe, Unto thy yoke and awe, Through the intisement of me. I haue ben bused since ye world began, to graffe thy lawes in the hart of man, Where they ought to be refused: And I haue so mingled gods c?ma?dem?tes with vaine zeales, &amp; blind intents that they be greatly abused. I set vp great ydolatry With a kynd of fylthy Sodometry, to geue mankynd a fall: And I brought vp suche supersticion Under the name of holynes and religyon, that disceyued almoste all. As holy Cardinals. holy Popes, Holy vestimentes, holy copes Holy armytes and Fryers Holy priestes. holy bisshoppes Holy monkes, holy abbotes yea, and all abstinate lyers. Holy pardons, holy beades, Holy saincts, holy ymages, With holy, holy bloud, Holy stockes, holy stones: Holy cloughtes, hole bones: yea, and holy holy wood. Holy skinnes, holy bulles: Holy rochetts, and coules Holy crouches and staues Holy hoodes, holy cappes Holy miters, holy hattes a good holy, holy knaues. Holy dayes, holy fastinges: Holy twitching, holy tastinges, Holy visions and sightes: Holy waxe, holy leade: Holy water, holy breade: To driue awaye spirites. Holy fyre, holy palme: Holy oyle, holy cream: And holy ashes also: Holy brouches, holy rynges: Holy knelynge. holy sensynges: And a hundred trim trams mo. Holy crosses, holy belles: Holy reliques, holy iouels: Of myne owne inuencion: Holy candels, holy tapers: Holy parchementes, holy papers: Had not you a holy sonne? Deuell. All these thinges, which thou hast done My honour and lawes hath maintained, But now, Oh alas, one thynge is begone, By the which mi kingdome is greatly decaied I shall lese al, I am sore afrayed, Except thy helpe I knowe right playne, I shall neuer be able to recouer it agayne. Gods worde is so greatly sprong vp in youth That he litle regardeth my lawes or me, He telleth his parentes that is very truth, That they of longe tyme haue deceyued be, He sayth, accordynge to christes veritie, All his doynges he wyll ordre and frame, Mortifiyng the flesshe Wt the lustes of ye same. Hipocrysye. A syr a, there beginneth the game, Hipocrysye. What, is Iuuentus become so tame? To be a new gospeler. Deuell. As fast as I do make, he doth marre, He that folowed so longe the steppes of good counsell. that knowledge and he together doth dwell, For who is so busye in eueri place, as youth Hipocrysie. To reade and declare the manifest truth? Deuell. But ho Hipocrisie if yu coulde stoppe his mouthe Thou shouldest wyn mi harte for euer, What would you haue me to do in the matter? Shewe me therein your aduisement. I woulde haue the go incontinent, And worke some craft, feate or policye, To set knowledge and hym at contrauersie, And hys company thy self greatly vse That Gods worde he may cleane a buse. Hipocrysye. At your request I wil not refuse to do that thynge which in me doth lye, Dout ye not, but I wyll excuse, those thynges which ye doth playnly denye And I wil handel my matters so craftely that ere he commeth to mans state: Gods worde and hys liuing shalbe cleane at the bate Deuell. thou shalt haue my blessing both early and late, And be cause thou shalt all mi counsel kepe thou shalt call my name frendshyp. Hipocrysie By the masse it is a name full mete, For my proper and amyable person, Deuell. Oh, fare wel fare wel my sonne, Spede thy busynes, for I must be gone, Hipocrysie I warrant you, let me a lone, I will be with Iuuentus anone, And that ere he be ware. And I wysse if he walke not streight. I wil vse such a sleyght, That shal trap hym in a snare. How shal I bryng this geare to passe? I can tel now by the masse, Without any more aduysement: I wil infect hym with wicked company, Whose conuersation shalbe so fleshly, yea, able to ouer come an innocent, This wicked felowshipe, Sall hym company kepe, For a whyle: And then I will bryng in, Abhominable lyuyng, Hym to beguyle. With wordes fayre I wyll hym tyse, Tellyng hym of a gyrle nyse, Which shal hym somwhat moue: Abhomynable liuing, though she be, yet he shal no other wayes se. But she is for to loue. She shall hym procure, To lyue in pleasure, After hys owne phantesy? And my matter to frame, I wyll call her name, Unknowen honestie. This wil I conuey, My matter I say, Some what hansomely, That through wicked felowship: And false pretende frendshep, youth shall lyue carnally. Trudge hypocrysie trudge, Thou art a good drudge, To serue the deuel: If thou shouldest lye and lurke, And not entend thy worke, Thy maister should do full euel. Here entreth, youth, to whom hepocrysye yet speaketh What maister youth. Wel I met by my trouth and whether a way? you are the last man, Whych I called on, I sware by thys daie. Me thought by your face Ere you cam in place, It should be you: Therfore I did a byde, For your commyng, thys is true. Iuuentus. For your gentelnes, syr. most hertely I thanke you But yet you must holde me som what excused, For to my symple knowledge I neuer knew That you and I together were acquainted, But neuertheles, if you do it renew, Old acquayntaunce will some be remembred Hipocrisie. Ah now I se wel youth is fethered And hys crumes he hath Well gathered, Since I spake with hym last A pore mans tale can not now be herde As in tymes past: I crye you mercy, I was som what bolde Thynkyng that your mastershyp would, Not haue byn so strange: But now I perceue that promocyon, Causeth both man, maners and fashyon Greatly for to chaunge. iuu?tus you are to blame this me to calenge For I thinke I am not he which you take me for Hipocrysye. yes, I haue knowen you euer since you were bore your age is yet vnder a score, Which I can wel remember: I wisse, I wisse you and I. Many a tyme haue ben ful mery. When you were yong and tender. iuu?tus Then I pray let vs reason no lenger But fyrst shewe your nominacion. Hipocrysye. Of my name to make declaracyon Without any dissimulacyon, I am called frendshyip: Although I be symple and rude of facyon yet by linage and generacyon, I am ney kyn to your mastership. iuu?tus What frendshyp. I am glad to se that you be mery, By mi trouth I had almost you forgot, By long absence brought out of memory, Hipocrysye. By the masse I loue you so hartely, That there is none so welcome to my company I pray you tell me, whether are you goyng? iuu?tus My entention is to go heare apreachyng Hipocrysie. A preachyng quod he, ha good litle one By chryst she will make you cry out of the wynnyng If you folowe her instruction so early in the mornyng, iuu?tus Full great I do abhore thys your wicked saying, For no doubt they encreace much sinne and vice, Therfore I pray you shew not your meanyng, For I delyght not in such folish fantesies Hypocrysye. Surely, then you are the more vnwyse. you mai haue a spyrt amongest them now and then Why should not you as wel as other men? iuu?tus As for al those fylthe doynges. I vtterly detest them, I wyll heare no more of youre wycked communycacyon. Hypocrysye. yf I may be so bold by your deliberation What wil you do at a preachyng? iuu?tus Learne som holsome and godly teaching, Of the true minister of Christes gospel. Hipocrysye. Tush, what he wil say I know right well, He wil say that God is a good man, He can make hym no better, and say the best he can iuu?tus I know that, but what then? The more that Gods worde is preached and taught The greater the occasion is to all christen men, To forsake their sinful liuinges, both wycked, vile &amp; naught And to repent their former euils, which they haue wrought Trustyng by Chrystes death to be redemed. And he that this doth, shal neuer be disceyued. Hipocrysye wel sayde mayster doctor, wel sayd. By the masse we must haue you, in to the pulpyt, I pray you be remembred, and couer your head For in dede you haue nede to kepe in your wit, A Sirra, who would haue thought it That youth had bene such a wel learned man: Let me se your portous gentle syr Ihon. iuu?tus No, it is not a boke for to loke on, you ought not to iest with Gods testam?t. Hipocrysye. What man, I pray you be content, For I do nothyng els but sai mi phantasie But yet if you would do after mi aduisment In that matter you should not be so busy Was not your father as wel learned as ye? And if he had sayd then as you haue now done I wisse, he had ben like to make a burne Iuunetus. It were much better for me, then to returne Fr? my fayth in Christ, &amp; the profession of hys worde. Hipocrysye. whether is better, a halter or a corde I can not tell, I sweare by Goddes mother But I thynge you wil haue the one or the other Wil you lose al your frendes Good wil To continue in that opion stil, Was ther not as wel lerned men before as now? yea, and better to I may saye to you And they thought the yonger sort of the people By the elders to take an example And if I did not loue you as nature doth me bynde you should not know so much of my mynde Iuunutus. Whether were I better to be ignoraunt and blynde And to be dampned in hel for infidelitie? Or to learne godli knowledge, wherin I shal finde The right path way to eternal felicitie? Hipocrycye. Can you denye, but it is your dutye Unto your elders to be obedient iuu?tus I graunt I am bound to obay my parentes In al thynges honest and lawful? Hipocrysie. Lawful quod ha, a foole foole Wil thou set men to scoole when they be olde I may say to you secretly The worlde was neuer meri Since chyldren where so boulde: Now euery boy wil be a teacher The father a foole, and the chyld a preacher Thys is preaty geare The foole presumptious of youth wyll turne shortly to great ruth I feare. I feare. I feare. Iuuuetus. The sermon wyll be done ere I can com there, I care not greatly whether I go or no, And yet for my promys, by God I sweare, Ther is no remedy but I must nedes go: Of my companyons there wyll be mo And I promysed them bi godds grace To mete them there as the sermon was. Hipocrysye. For onse breakyng promyse do not you passe, Make some excuse the matter to cease what haue they to do? And you and I were I wote wote where we woulde be as mery as there yea, and merryer to Iuueutus. I would gladly in your compane go But if my companyons shoulde chaunce to se They woulde report full euell by me: And peraduenture if I would it vse. My company they would cleane refuse. Hipocrycye. what, are those felowes so curious That your selfe you can not excuse? I wyll teache you the matter to conuey Do what your owne lust, and saye as they say And if you be reproued wyth your owne affynytye Byd them plucke the beame out of there owne eye The olde popysh priestes mocke and despyse And the ignoraunt people that beleue theyr lyes Call them papistes, hipocrites, &amp; ioynyng of the plough. Fare out the matter, and then good ynough. Let your boke at your gyrdle be tyed, Or els in your bosome that he may be spyed, And then it will be sayd both wyth youth and age yonder felow hath an excellent knowledge. tushe tushe, I could so beare the busshe, that all should be flusshe. that euer I did. iuu?tus Now by my trouth you are meryly disposed Let vs go thether as you thenke best.

Now I beshrew his herte, that to that wyll not agree, But yet because the tyme shall not seme very longe, Or eare we departe, let vs haue a mery songe The sing as foloweth. Why should not youth fulfyl hys owne mynde, As the course of nature doth hym bynde, Is not euery thyng ordayned to do hys kynd? Report me to you, report me to you. Do not the floures spring fresh and gaye, Pleasaunt and swete in the month Maye? And when theyr tyme commeth they fayd awaye, Report me to you, report me to you. Be not the trees in wyntter bare, Lyke vnto theyr kynde, such they are, And when they spring, theyr frutes declare Report me to you, report me to you. What should youth do, wyth the frutes of age But liue in pleasure in thys passage, For when age commeth hes lustes wyll swage Report me to you, report me to you. Why shoulde not youth fulfyll hys owne mynde As the course of nature doth hym bynde. &amp;c. They go fourth. Here entreth god counsell. O mercyfurl Lord, who can seace to lament, Or kepe hys hart from continual mournyng, To se how youth is fallen from thy worde And wholy enclyned to abhominable lyuyng, He lyueth nothyng accordyng to his profession But alas hys lyfe is, to thy worde abusion, Except thy grat mercy to hys vtter confusyon. O where is the godly conuersacyon Which shoulde be among the professour of thy worde O where may a man finde now one faythfull That is not enfected with dissencyon or descorde? Or amongest whome are all vices abhord vtterly O where is the brotherly loue betwene man &amp; man we may lament the tyme our vice be gan O where is the peace &amp; mekenes, longe suffring &amp; temperaunce wich are the frutes of Gods holy spirit, with whome is the flesh brought vnder obedience, Or who readeth the scripture to the intent to folow it who vseth not now couetousnes and disceite, Who geueth vnto the poore that whych is dewe? I thinke in thys world, few that lyue nowe. O where is ye godly ex?ple that parentes should geue. Unto their yong familie, by godly &amp; vertuous lyuyng? Alas how wicked do they themselfes lyue, Without any fear of God, or his ryghteous threatening, They haue no respect vnto the dreadfull rekenyng, Whych shalbe required of vs, when the Lorde shall come, As a ryght full iudge at the daye of dome, O what a ioyfull sight was it for to se, When youth be gan Gods worde to imbrace? Then he promysed godly knowledge and me, That from our instructi? he would neuer turne his face But now he walketh, alas: in the vngodlyes chase, Heapyng sinne vp on sinne, vice vpon vyce, He that lyueth most vngodly, is counted most wyse, Her entreth Iuuentus Who is here playng at the dyce? I herd one speake of synnes and cyce, Hys wordes did me entice. Hither to come: Good counsell Ayouth youth, whether doest thou runne? Greatly I do be wayle thy misrable estate, The tyrrible plagues, which in Gods lawe are written, Hang ouer thy head both early and late: O fleshly capernite, stubburne and obstinate, Thou haddest leuer forsake Christ thy sauiour and kinge Then thy fleshly swinish lustes, &amp; abbomynable lyuynge. Iuuentus. what olde hoorson, art thou a chydyng? I will play a spyrt, why should I not? I set a myte by thy chekyng what hast thou to do, and yf I lose my cote: I wyll trill the bones whyle I haue one grote, And when there is no more inke in the pen, I wyll make a shyfe as well as other men. Good co?sell. Then I perceue you haue for gotton cleane, The promyse that you made vnto knowledge and me you sayde such fleshly fruites shoulde not besene, But to Gods worde your lyfe should a gre Full true be the wordes of the prophet Osey No verytie nor knowledge of God is now in the land. But abomynable vices hath gotten the vpper hand. Iuuentus. your mynde therin I do well vnderstand. you go a bout my lyueng to despise, But you wil not se the beames in your own eyes, Good counsell The deuell hath you dysceiued whych is ye auctor of lyes And trape you in hys snar of wicked hypocrye, Therfore all that euer you do deuyse Is to maintayne your fleshly lybertie Iuuentus. I merueyle why you do thys report me, Wherin do I my life abuse? Good councell your whole conuersacyon I may well accuse, As in my consience iust occasion I find. Therfore be not offended, although I exprese my mynde Iuuentus. Bi the masse if thou tel not truth, I wil not be behind To touch you as well agayne. Good counsell For thys thyng most cheifly I do complaye: Haue ye not professed the knowledge of Chrystes gospell And yet I thynke no more vngodlines doth raigne, In any wicked Heathen, Turke or infidell: who can deuyse that synne or euyll, That you practyse not from day to day yea and count yt nothyng but a iest or a play, Alas, what wantonnes remaineth in your flesh? How desyrous are you, to accomplish your owne wyll what pleasure &amp; delyght haue you in wickednes? How diligent are you your lustes to fulfyll? S. Paul sayth that you ought your fleshly lustes to kyll But vnto hys teachyng, your lyfe ye will not frame Therfore in vayne you beare a christians name. Rede the .v. to the Galathians, &amp; there you shal se That the flesh rebelleth agaynst the spirit And that your own flesh is our most veter enemye, If in youre soules helth you do delyght: The tyme were to long now to recite, What whordom, uncleanes and fylthe communycacyon Is despersed wyth youth, in euery congregation To speake of pryde, enuye, and abhomynable othes They are the common practises of youth, To auaunce your flesh, you cut &amp; iagge your clothes, And yet ye are a great gospeller in the mouth: What shall I say, for thys plasphemyng the truth I wyll shew you what saynt, Paule doth declare In his epistle to the Hebrues, and the .x. Chapter. For hym sayth he, whych doth wyllyngly syn or cons?t After he hath receued the knowledge of the veryte Remayneth no more sacrifice, but a fearful lok?g for iudgem?t And a trrible fier, whych shal consume ye aduersary And Christ sayth that thys blasphemy, Shal neuer be pardoned nor forgeuen, In thys world, nor in the world to come Iuuentus. He lyeth doun, Alas alas, what I haue wrought and done? Here in thys place I wil fal doune desperate, To aske for mercy, now I know it is to late Alas alas, that euer, I was begat, I wolde to God I had neuer bene borne, All faythfull m? that beholde this wreched state May very iusty laugh me to scorne: They may say my tyme I haue euel spent and worne, Thus in my first age, to worke my owne destructyon, In the eternall paynes is my parte and portion. Good counsell Why youth, art thou fallen into desperation? What man plucke vp thine harte, and rise, Although thou se nothing now, but thy condempnation yet it may please God agayn to open thy eyes: Ah wretched creature, what doest thou surmise? Thinckest not that Gods mercy doth excede thy synne? Remembre his mercifull promises &amp; c?fort thi self in h? Iuuentus. O syr, this state is so miserable the which I lye in, That my comfort and hope from me is seperated, I woulde to god I had neuer bene. Wo worth the time that euer I was created. Good counsell A fayre vessel vnfaithfull and faint harted, Doest thou thinke that god is so merciles, That when the sinner doth repent, and is conuerted, That he wyll not fulfyll his mersifull promyses: Iuuentus. Alas syr, I am in suche heauines, That his promises I can not remembre Good councell In thy wickednes continue no lenger, But trust in the Lorde without any feare, And his mercifull promises shall shortly appeare Iuuentus I would beleue if I myght them heare, With all my hart, power and mynde, Good counsell The liuing God hath hym hether assined: Lo, where he commeth euen here by, Therfore marke hys sayinges diligently. Here entreth goddes merciful promises. The Lord by his prophet Ezechiel sayeth in this wyse playnlye As in the .xxxiii. chapter it doth appere. Be conuerted O ye children, and turne vnto me, And I shall remedy the cause of your departure, And also he sayth in the .xviii. chapter, I do not delyght in a synners death, But that he should conuert &amp; liue, thus the Lord sayth, Iuuentus. Then must I geue neither credit nor fayth, Unto sainct Paules saying, which this man did alege Gods mercyfull promyses. yes, you must credite th?, according vnto knowledge, For sainct Paul speketh of those whiche resist ye truth by viol?ce And so end theyr lyues without repentaunce, thus sainct Austine doth them define, yf vnto the Lordes word you do your eares encline, And obsarue those thinges, which he hath commaunded this sinfull state, in the whiche you haue lyen. Salbe forgotten, and neuer more remembred, And Christ hym selfe in the gospel hath promysed, that he which in hym vnfaynedly doth beleue, Although he were dead, yet shall he lyue. Her riseth Iuuentus. these comfortable sayinges doth me greatly moue to arise from this wretched place. Gods mercyfull promyses. For me his mercy sake thou shalt optayne hys grace And not for thyne owne desertes, this must thou know For my sake alone he shall receyue solace, For my sake alone, he wyll thee marcy shew, therfore to hym as it is moste dew, Geue most harty thankes, with hart vnfayned Whose name for euer more be praysed. Good counsell The prodigall sonne as in Luke we rede which in vicious liuing his good dooth wast, As sone as his lyuing he had remembred, To confesse his wretchednes he was not agast, wherfore his father, louingly hym embrast, And as right ioyful, the text sayth playne Because his sonne was returnen agayne. Iuuentus O synfull flesh, thy pleasurs are but vaine, Now I fynde it true, as the scripture doth saye, Brode &amp; pleasaunt is the path, which ledeth vnto payne, But vnto eternall lyfe, full narow is the waye, He that is not led by Gods spyrite, surely goeth astrayer And all that euer he doth, shalbe cleane abhorde Although he bragge &amp; bost neuer so much of Gods worde, O subtell Satan, full deceitfull is thy snare, Who is able thy falshed to dysclose? What is the man that thou doest fauour or spare And dost not tempt hym eternall ioyes to lose? Not on the world, surele I suppose, Therfoore happy is the man, which doth truli wayte, Alwayes to refuse thy decetful and crafty bayt When I had thought to lyue most christanly And folowed the steppes of knowledg &amp; good councel, Ere I was ware thou haddest deceyued me And brought me into the path, whych leadeth vnto hel: And of an earnest professor of chrystes gospell Thou madest me an ypocrite, blynd and peruert, And from vertue vnto vice, yu hadst cle?e turned mi hart Fyrst by hypocrysie thou didest me moue, The mortifycacyon of the flesh, cleane to forsake, And wanton desyre to embrace and loue, Alas to thynke of it, my hart doth quake, Under the tytle of frendshyp to me he spake, And so to wicked feloshyp did me brynge, Which broughe me cleane to abhominable lyuing Thus I saye. Sathan did me disceyue, And wrapped me in sinne many afould, The steppes of good counsell, I did forsake and laeue, And forgote the wordes, which be fore to me he told: The fruites of a true Christan, in me waxed cold I folewed myne one lustes, the fleshe I did not tame, And had them in dirision, which woulde not do the same. yet it hath pleased God of his endles mercy To geue me respite my lyfe to amende. From the bottome of my hart, I repent my iniquitie. I wil walke in hys lawes vnto my lyues ende: From hys holy ordinaunce I wyll neuer dicende. But my whole delyght shalbe to lyue therein, Utterly abhorring all filthynes and synne. All Christen people, whiche be here present, May learne by me hypocrysye to know With the which the deuel, as Wt a poyson moste pestilente Dayly seketh all men to ouer throw: Credite not all thynges vnto the out warde shew, But trye th? Wt Gods word, that squire &amp; rule moste iust Whiche neuer deceued them that in hym put theyr trust Let not flattryng fr?dship, nor yet wicked company Parswade you in no wise, Gods worde to abuse But se that you stand stedfastly vnto the veritie And accord?g to the rule therof, your doings frame &amp; vse Neyther kynred nor felowshyp shal you excuse When you shall appere before the iudgement seat But your owne secret concyence shal th? geue an audite All you that be young, whom I do now represent, Set youre delite both day &amp; nyght on Christes testament yf pleasure you tickele, be not fikle, &amp; sodenly slyde, But in Gods feare eueri where, se that you abyde In your tender age, seke for knowledge, &amp; after wisedom r?ne &amp; in iour old age, teach your famili, to do, as you haue d? youre bodys subdue, vnto vertue, delite not in vaniti Say not I am y?g, I shall liue long lest iour dais short?ed be Do not enclyne, to spend ye tyme, in wanton ioyes &amp; uyce For idlenes doth encrese much wickednes and vyce, Do not delaye the tyme, and saye my ende is not nere For Wt short warning, the lordes c?m?g shal sod?ly apere God geue vs grace, his word to ?brace, &amp; to liue therafter That be the same, hys holy name, may be prased euer. Good counsel. Now let vs make oure supplicacions together For ye prosperous estate of oure noble &amp; vertuous quene, That in her godly procedinges she may still perseuer, Which seketh the glory of God aboue all other thynge. O Lord endue her hart with true vnderstandyng. And geue her a prosperous lyfe, longe ouer vs to rayne, To gouerne &amp; rule her people as a worthy seruant. Iuunetus. Also, let vs for all the nobilite of this realme, And namely for those, whome her grace auctorised, To mayntayne the publike welth ouer vs &amp; them, That they may se his gracyous actes published, And they, beyng truly admonished, By the complaynt of them, which are wrongfulli opprest May sette a reformation, and se it redrest. Good co?sell. Then shall thys land enioy great quietnes &amp; rest And geue vnto God most herty thankes therfore, To whome be honor, prase and glory for euermore Finis Quod R. Weuer.</field>
