      <field name="fulltext">âPoscia, piÃ¹ che il dolor, potÃ¨ il digiuno.â Dante. Dell' Inferno, Canto xxxiii. 75.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. They who would lift the heavy tragic pall Upon the groaning shoulders of their Muse Have ever warned the light and easy-soul'd, Who shun the joyless truth in human things, To fly her pitiful, dread company, And seek some sister with leaf-knotted lyre, And garments gaily dancing in the wind. So be they warned; for on the sheer descent And downward of this father's destiny Is scarce a ledge for Hope the climber's foot To cling to, trembling at the chasm hoar. Who, peering, pass that brink are travellers To a mid-gulf of misery from whence There is no looking back: when parents err Nothing avails; there is no comforter.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene.âStirling; removed during the action to Falkland Castle and neighbourhood, Edinburgh, and the Castle of Rothsay in Bute.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âStirling. A Courtyard. Enter King Robert and Allan. King Robert. A sunny day! Allan. Rain will be dew to-night. King Robert. A prophet with a voice blows no man good! How sweet the sunshine presses on my brow, Gently rebuking wrinkles! There's the warmth Of a young hand in 't. Here is companyâ My brother! [Enter Albany, Prior, Councillors. Allan withdraws.] Albany. Grant us private audience. King Robert. I think I hear your words within your face, It says displeasure plainly. Some new lapse O' the reckless boy? Albany. Would he had ne'er been born To pay dishonour as the price of life He drew from regal loins. His folly grows To sinful ripeness. 1st Councillor. Which we cannot check. King Robert. You who are strong and wise! 2nd Councillor. In vain, my liege, Are strength and wisdom; for the prince whose charge And government you laid upon our love, Is hard against our influence, and rears Against our slightest check; mocks at the vow That pledged him to our guidance; in our sight Is boldly riotous and full of jest, Railing derision, scorn unsuitable. No pow'r on earth can bend him to the grace Of honest manners and sobriety. Prior. No pow'r on earth! True, true! But from the heavens Stream counsel and a strength ineffable; These have been uninvoked. My gracious liege, Your son is left unfostered by the Church, A heathen and a heretic. King Robert. Your words Astound my conscience, prior; on my soul, He goes with me to chapel oft and oft. Prior. To mock his God with wandering eyes and lips That whisper Belial's accents, or the sneers Of anti-Christ. His thoughts are deadly, vile With most pernicious modern heresy. King Robert. I cannot take his thoughts upon my soul; His deeds too much afflict it. I must speak At every moment words of reprimand That shake my courage; I must ever dread Some new occasion for my wearied blame; Oppose reproof to laughter; beat my ease To hateful effort; tear from off mine eyes The hood that Love hath made to darken them From sight of his offence. I cannot take The other burden of his lawless mind. Prior. You are unworthy then to bear the name That ties the young man's fate upon your care. You put his education in the hands Of these strong barons and grave councillors, Because you fear'd the weakness of your love Might prove his ruin. Ill you thought; for fear Prepares not for calamity. These men, Of sober worthy living, gracious rule, And rigid will, confess their discipline Is brought to scorn, and wherefore? O my liege, You gave away the office and command That's natural to your paternity Through dread, which brought as its accomplishment The very harm you imaged; for your son No longer bows to that revered control Which is the father's blest prerogative. King Robert. Was I to blame? His wild, defiant youth Was motherless, and I, bereft of wife,â I could not draw stern prompting from her grave Who loved him with a sacred gentleness That won his wayward years to her sweet rule. Our children are her monument, the sign That once she lived, her epitaph that's writ On the fair living tablets that she wrought, My love's memorial and effigy. Prior. Keep pure from stain of schism and of sin These relicsâthese inscriptions to your love. King Robert. I have, I have! Prior. But duty, like the sea, Flows not away, but ever back returns, Set to the same attempt. King Robert. I would the boy Were like his brother! Albany. Pooh, that does not help. King Robert. We call our children oursâyet in my son There's something of a stranger, and 'tis hard To play the host; he is so much unlike All that I ever was. I think you spoke. Albany. My duty speaks his folly and offence, Else were I gladly silent. King Robert. Albany, I knew it; 'twas your love and vigilance That roused my tardy fears. Albany. You have an eye Too kindly, of too dove-like quality, To see where carrion stinks; less fortunate, There's eagle in my ken. King Robert. Ah, when you spoke, I found I knew my son but in a mist. What's to be done, unless we put his case Into fair hands? Albany. Ha? King Robert. Then you've never thought Of marriage? Albany. No. King Robert. 'Tis thither that I look With confidence for help, and I am bent On seizing all within the realm of Hope. You doubt a last success? Albany. I do. Ah, well! You've found the woman? King Robert. No; I lack advice. Albany. Leave me to choose; I have a keener sight For that in human beings over which Flow action and expression like a streamâ The veiled and solid stuff. King Robert. Let's go withinâ The sun is hot!âand talk of this at length. David is so unlike me! [Noise without. Albany. There's his laugh! Oh, every fool has bells within his mouth! [Exeunt. [Enter Rothsay, Ramorgny, Walter, Ralph, Randolph, and others; Huntsmen carrying a stag before them.] Rothsay. I'm hungry. Let us dine! Bear forward to the cook, mine honest friends. I'll lie upon this golden cloth of light The sun has thrown upon the ground, and wait Your festal summons. [Exeunt Huntsmen. Walter, couch you here. Ramorgny hereâfor every one a place. Now is it not delightful to be youngâ The friend of every element? Old age Faints under heat, and trembles in the blast, Withers with cold, and aches with rainy air; But sun and wind and ice and storm to us Are Nature's boon companions. While I think Of other blessings, Walter, do you praise King Youth with opening buds about his crown. Walter [sings]. Who hath ever given Cupid's head white hair, Or hath put our roses Under the snow's care? If such fool there be, We'll cry him God's mercie! Ralph. Bravo! Rothsay. Good Walt, thy merry voice is dryâ A stream that suffers drought. Let's have a stoup; We need not wait for dinner. Randolph. Nay, I'll go. [Exit. Ramorgny. Ha, ha! Now speak your praise. Rothsay. Right joyfully, For everything is joyful when we're young, Immediately, fully. To old men There's no direct and steadfast joyousness In flow'rs o' spring; they ever see them fade, Not sharing with them, as we do, the time, The freshness, the astonishment. In vain The tide of vintage strives to loose and float Their moor'd and creaky passions; emulous, We dip elastic prows in seas far off. Their bond of friendship is grey Memory; But ours is golden Hope, which gathers up A large companionship among ourselves, And all things in the world, which be it night Or winter have assurance of the day Or spring to come: this crabbÃ¨d sires forget, And dispraise Nature with their melancholy. [Re-enter Randolph with wine.] Ramorgny. Here come the beakers! Rothsay. Let us drink to Youth! We're mortal in this world when it is gone, Immortal Youth! Walter. I pledge your dark hair and I pledge your light; Down with the parti-colour'd and the white! Rothsay. Here's to your hairless chin! Ramorgny. To yours, and yours! [They drink. Randolph. We've magpies in yon elm that tops the wall; One! Walter. That's ill-luck, my stars! One, two,âno, three! Ralph. A marriage! that's of merrier import. Ramorgny. Ugh! there's a fourth! Mercy! a burial! [Re-enter Albany.] Rothsay. Ha, ha, ha! Walter. Ho, ho! Albany. What are you doing? Rothsay. Sitting i' the sun. Who'll be a dog to lend my uncle eyes? It seems he hath infirmity of sight. Albany. 'Tis that way lies your weakness. You I see Couch'd here amid a litter of low churls, Swilling untimely wine, whose place is set Scarce lower than the throne by Scotland's voice Calling you Regent, and endowing you With pow'r unnatural to thwart the will Of your anointed king and natural sire. A senseless boy, you think to drive the steeds Of sovereignty and never hold a rein; Nor will you listen to the words of those Whom Age hath taughtâthe folly of stiff youth That will not work its lessons by our lips. Rothsay. Now look you here, friends, and I'll tell you this,â Poor Youth was never yet judged by its peers; Such have no judgment, and its case is left To elders, who once shared its thoughtlessness, But now look on with sharp intolerance, And brand it to the world. 'Tis true enough That summer recks not of the winter's cold. But winter's store would ne'er be harvested Save for the fiery sunshine of past days. And so with your experience, wise-head! Albany. Hum! Float to destruction! I have done my part, Nor can be pilot to unyielded bark; Run on the reefs I know and breast the waves That draw you to a whirlpool in my chart! I've done with you. Rothsay. Dismissal to us, lads! You 're strangely stillâ Come, let me hear your lips; come, make a noise, And raise the cur's-tail droop about your heads! His tongue will lash no more. Get up! There's Meg Calls us to venison and smoking cheer. Lass, I must meet these heralds. [Kisses her. To the feast! [Exeunt. Albany. And such a bubble of humanity Must keep me from the throne and float between Me and the Regency! He lives a life Blown out of pleasure's mouth and woven all Of ardent feeblenessâthe chosen stuff On which the senses paint their fickle will In colours of the rainbow. I've a storm Within could burst this gay impediment Should it but reach him. Time will settle that. Now to the point! He must be marriedâso! I'll have his full price in the treasury Before I see him husband. Many lords Would buy his hand for daughters of their house With offers of much gold. Who offers most Shall have the worthless goods. [Enter the Earl of March.] Greeting! You're brief, And conversation is an enemy For sword-cuts of your tongue. I'm not a man Who loves a marshall'd troop of many words, Hence will I strike the very eye of aim. The kingâthis know I from his private speechâ Seeks for his son a bride; but since his chests Are ebbing in their golden property, He cannot deck a marriage with due pomp And suitable festivity. I pray Your counsel in this matter. Earl of March. 'Twould be worth Some paltry gold to have a future king For son-in-law. I'd give it. Albany. No, you jest. Earl of March. I'd give two thousand pounds. Albany. Well, well! Earl of March. You mark? Two thousand pounds to heap the treasury. You understand me? Albany. Yes. We need no words. Lady Elizabeth is queen to be, As I am Albany and she your child. [Exeunt. Scene II. âThe same. A Room. Enter Douglas. Douglas. Shall March be grandsire unto future kings, And Douglas carry no emblazon'd fruit On any of his branches? Question vain! For Douglas in his issue shall be crown'd Maternal ancestor of royalties. Proud March, secure in fancy of his prize, The money for its purchase in his clasp, Shall find himself outwitted by mere gold, When offered by my hand and double-heap'd. The heir of Scotland mated to his house! Not so! I'd rather beg my weary bread; At March's doggish portal show my scars; Shoot out my lips in kisses to the foot Of his new-honour'd daughter. By Saint Bride, This goldâsun-counterfeiting coin, with stamp Of sovereignty, the even round of Heav'n Is bare ofâthis shall turn her day to night, And wrap her pride in heavy lethal shroud. [Enter Marjorie Douglas.] This is your dowry. 'Tis a mighty pile! Marjorie Douglas. My father, who hath sought my hand? Douglas. No man. Marjorie Douglas. Then, prythee, wed me to no airy boy, That giggles at his mistress and his clothes, His foolish quips, the serious round of things He takes for jests of God to move his sides. Beseech you, spare me that. Douglas. Lo and behold Your suitor in this gold. Marjorie Douglas. I take it, sir. I'd rather clasp it than a tricksy hand That's current with all maidens. Douglas. You divine It is the Prince of Scotland you must wed? Marjorie Douglas. David of Rothsayâsweet and young and fair, Cunning in literature, a seemly form And able head, they say; but unto me No more than the cold vision of a dream. Douglas. To-night he'll be your husband, and your arms Fold as warm guardians round no chilly shade Or distant apparition. Marjorie Douglas. On my knees I pray you save me from the keen disgrace Of being called his wife. He never looks With any favour on me, who is free Of loving graces to all loveliness. My father, I should hate to be his bride; Yea, loathe it to the centre of my soul. Douglas. My daughter shall obey me. Never yet Hath woman of my house been obstinate Against a father's life-controlling will. Marjorie Douglas. In all things I obey you, for my blood Instructs me in that duty. Yet my veins Are now the scene of struggle 'tween your will And mine that is against it. You are old, A warrior, a parent, and you win. Douglas. Go, get you dress'd, for I must seek the king. Put on your best array, nor set your lips To such a bitter aspect. Get you back. [Exit Marjorie Douglas. I'll move the will of Albany; that done, The king is willing and the prince my son. [Exit. [Enter on the other side Lindsey and Ramorgny.] Ramorgny. I note that you are sad. Lindsey. How else, i' faith! My daughter, my Euphemia, is dead. The prince once bound him to her gentle love, Forgot it or was turn'd by force of State From truth and honour. Sweetly hath she died, Love's flower that when the fost'ring sun withdraws Dies patiently uncolour'd of its joy. Ramorgny. Alas, a careless freak to dim her life! He thought she had forgotten him, nor slipt One gleam to where she pined. I never dreamt She held him bound. 'Twas but a passionate First fancy of his boyhood. Lindsey. These are words. No injur'd breast is home to loyalty. But I forgot you're of his company. I bid you straight good morning. [Exit Lindsey. Ramorgny. So it is. I'll treasure his offence among my store Of hoarded secrets; like a bunch of keys Such dangle at the belt of policy. I'd move the prince against his uncle, such My present plot, for I am dear to him; And if his youth could crush down Albany, I should be foremost in the rank of men. What could incite him more or fiercelier Than traffic of his choice in marriage; this, They say, is sold from March to Douglas, sold By Albany for treasureâso the men Of Douglas whisper, and I'll raise their voice Until it reach the boy's dishonour'd ears. [Exit. Scene III. âA Council-chamber. King Robert, Albany, and Douglas. Albany. My lord of Douglas offers to the state Twice March's sum to have a marriage tied Between his daughter and your son and heir. King Robert. How, brother? when my son is fast betrothed To March's daughter and his holy vows Beyond a shameless purchase! [Aside.] Oh, I fear That furrow in the black earl's heavy brow Where cuts the plough-share of an iron wrath. Douglas. My lord the king ... King Robert. Good earl, I am distraught, Nor fully know what you would have me do. Douglas. Sanction another marriage for your son With one who springs from truer loins than his Who hath forestall'd my offerâfrom a house Most tried and loyal, with the purple dye Of regal blood superb within its veins. The faith of March is but a fungus growth, A recent wat'ry issue of his lands, The increase of a day, the slipp'ry spoil Of tardy, smiling favour; but my truth Is rooted on the centuries and fed With ancient honours and continued grace. Albany. My lord of Douglas, I will plead your case. You know, my liege, the prince's hand was bound To March's daughter on a promise rich Of treasure to the sore-impoverish'd State. Now comes my lord of Douglas, fired to join With sacred bond his dear paternal love And cherish'd loyalty; in lavish mood He gives a double treasure to our chests For sake of that which sluggish March obtains With half this eager offer. Shall we starve The gaping treasury and cheat the thin And lacking realm thro' terror of a knot But tied with words? Nay, rather we must stab The empty heart of languageâa mere vow, And rend it into nothing. King Robert [aside]. O my soul! He ever reasons conscience out of me With higher goodness than my frailty owns!â You urged me thus to move the highland clans, Chattan and Kay, upon the Inch of Perth, Before my face, in midst of festal pomp, To fall upon each other like wild beasts, And tear the crimson life as trophy out Of eight and fifty corpses. Albany, Through all the years until my dying day, Mine eyes will see the sight they sicken'd from Even to blindness. God hath planted it Before the steadfast mirror of my soul That cannot blink; so there is no relief. You said it was for safety of my land. Albany. Ay, so I said, and so it proved, my liege. Your lowlands lie in rip'ning repose, And harvesters, with sickles round the neck, From brown lips bless my counsel. King Robert. Christian deeds Are said to lay a peace upon our souls Like hush of snow: the virtue which you preach Tears like a howling tempest, sharp and foul. One falls a blessing, and one roars a ban; Yet both are righteousness and both of God! Help me, ye heavenly pow'rs! Albany. Alas, on earth The choice is often between good and good, Not good and evil; hence a struggle scars The upright, tender conscience that must turn Its back upon some part of righteousness To face a fuller portion. So a king For sake of those he rules must bear a strife Between the holy teachings of his heart And holier duties of his crownÃ¨d head. King Robert. Yes, you are right. The gold upon my brow Hath often bought the voice within my breast. Proceed! This contract split, do you not fear The wrath of March? Methinks it might so rage Our coffers would be emptier than ere Lord Douglas filled them, and we broke our word. There lies the pinch of conscience. Douglas. Choose your foesâ The fickle March or staunchest Douglas! Choose To tie me closer to your love, or break The bonds of fealty my injured pride Would burn to carry. Albany. Think of it, my liegeâ Lord Douglas is the pillar of the realm; His pow'r the very dais of your throne. King Robert. Good cousin Douglas! Albany. Brother, I have urged The harsh and stinging duty of a crown; A sweeter reason waits for utterance, Private, paternal. Ofttimes have we mourn'd The free, immodest living of your son; We dreamt of marriage as a bond to clasp His vagrant love and fancies wandering. For this the woman of our choice should bear A firm and constant nature, little touch'd With fickle luring passion and mere grace Of colour'd beauty. Such are threads of silk; We seek for chains infrangible and sure. Slender and soft is March's daughter, trick'd With cloying charms; but strong and proud of heart, Solemn in years and grave in countenance Is Marjorie of Douglas, framed to curb Ill-mannerly approach, and turn to shame The levity of green unbridled youth. [Enter Rothsay.] King Robert. David! I shrink to meet his glance. Albany. How now, Lord Regent, that you break upon us thus? We rarely see you at the council-board. Your seat is yonder. Rothsay. In the market-place Slaves stand for sale. I will not sit; I'll stand In purchasable shame before you all Who bargain for my manhood; stand and watch My father sell the birthright of my flesh; Yea, stand and bear a sacrilege my youth Must damn itself to credit. King Robert. David, peace! Rothsay. God! I am faint with insult, and the thought I had of my own self is sick to death; I'm wounded in a place no tears can wash, Outraged beyond the surgeon's knife of speech; I cannot lift the colour to my face, For shame is so ashamed that she has fled. Hucksters! King Robert. Oh, silence! Rothsay. Nothing glorious Is marketableâfame, nor love, nor deeds Of any virtue, youth nor happiness; Nothing, oh nothing, but the meanest things Of which I am the meanest. On my soul, You drag me in the dirt and there I'll lie And dash it in your faces; [to King Robert] ay, in yours. 'Tis well you are my elders; if you were My age, I hardly think that I could bear To leave you living. Albany. Wherefore all this noise And rampant passion? We would understand The tossing cause thereof. Rothsay. Speak it! Oh no! 'Twould want an old and worldly merchant, one Who has a counting-house. I'm still a prince About the lips, nor know your tricks with coin, Your sales of man for woman, your low truck And miserable frauds. You've ruin'd me, And thrown my youth down to the bottom step Of Pride's high stairs. I'll never climb again. Douglas. Now by Saint Bride ... Rothsay. Prate not of brides to me in holy terms, Ye cursÃ¨d purchasers of manhood's fame! A bride! A mistress owning whom she serves, The handmaid to her lackey hired with gold! A sanctified and blessÃ¨d state, my lords! King Robert. David! It is not so. ... At leastâ Rothsay. It is. King Robert. For your sake and the country's ... Rothsay. I must wed The wither'd lass of kind Earl Archibald. Douglas. Sir David, Duke of Rothsay ... Rothsay. Bear her tongue, Which nips the meanest bud that Love can grow. Albany. Nephew, these words are childish; this the rage Of young and milky feeling, when the tough And unfamiliar bread of this world's life Forces soft inclination from its pap And diets it on dry necessity. Those of your birth must ever pay such price For their high station. King Robert. And their people's good. Albany. Thus hath it ever been and so must be With you as princely others in all lands. Rothsay. Elizabeth was fair! Albany. And Marjorie Is noble. Rothsay. Balanced cunningly! Ha, ha! Albany [aside]. He's dropp'd to levity and lost his case, Now I can handle him.â[Aloud.] There is no way But that you yield, and with untroubled mind Enjoy such freedom as your birth allows. King Robert. Brother, what do you say? Albany [aside]. The honeyâhush!â Commending to young lips the medicine.â [Aloud.] Use charily the privilege. Rothsay. Not I! Oh, write your contract, for it joins my life To snaky-headed Sin, in whose hot breast I'll know what pleasure is. Call forth your priestâ He's but a pander in the guise of Heav'n. Let Hymen's torches flareâthey smell of pitch And sulph'rus fever of contemn'd desire; Ring from your steeplesâ'tis the curfew bell; Prepare your bridal veilâ'tis hiding night; Present your hateful bride to pulseless armsâ And Lust receives the harlot in its clasp. King Robert. Mine ears have never yet unclosed their doors To words of viler passion. 'Tis the fiend Of wrath and opposition in your soul That rages in such speech. Your headlong sense And reinless fury well deserve more curb Than marriage with a noble woman, one Whose touch is conquest and whose presence peace. Your land requires the sacrifice, if such You hold the sacred tie; and there you stand With selfish tumult on abandon'd lips, Disgraced by Reason's flight. You cannot know, Thus senseless, if you love ... Rothsay. Love! Speak it not! It is a glorious word whose ecstasy Opens the soul to morning; a sweet bird That sings along the tangled forest ways Of Impulse and Enchantment. Name that name, I'll lock it in your throat. King Robert. Son David, hold! You have forgotten in your frowardness To whom you speak. Rothsay. No surelyâ'tis my sire Who puts me up to auction; that the face My mother chose. Forget! My brain is clear To take such recognition, keep its brand Till death unkin me. That the hoary frame, Whose flesh inherited ties down my life To bondage till the worms unloose the web. Work out your pleasure; use me as you will; I do not care; I'm yours to mar or make. Marry my hand, turn all my heart to gold, The filthy gold that's damn'd me! Walter, Ralph, Ramorgny, to the tavern! [Rushes out. King Robert. Woe is me! There is my own blood in that flashing face; I feel it stir the currents of my life. Albany. You must be firm. My lord of Douglas bends A raging brow that dooms unless assuaged. King Robert. Cousin, forgive my son his thankless mood. He's restive against bridle; his free youth Chafes at the sound of bondage, tho' the reins Be in a woman's hand. Douglas. Fear not, my liege. The priest shall rivet marriage with my house. Albany. Lord David's rash offence will soon dissolve Beneath his nature's lightness. King Robert. Think you so? When roused, he hath a stubborn petulance That swells above control. Albany. A song or dance Open safe floodgates to his giddy fume. King Robert. Ay, so it seems; but in his bitterness There is a sly tenacity that coils Within the colour'd vestment of his mirth, Cold as a snake and ready for the hiss. Albany. Youth, youthâmere youth! 'Tis ever harsh and sweet, Honey and gall, the zephyr and the blast, The union of jarring opposites. King Robert. He never has forgiven me, forsooth, Because I gave his training and control To certain grave and pow'rful councillors, Who cut him off from growing wantonness, Unseemly conversation and light sports. He seem'd with whole and gracious heart to bend To this my wish and swore obedience; By healthy counsel braced, conform'd himself To their direction and good mastership. But ever and anon a shaft was sped From scorn-bent lips that pierced my fair content; And when his mother died, he rush'd away, As if a noose were broken, from restraint Of agÃ¨d wisdom, gave himself afresh To lightness, and no force can bend him now To gravity of manners. Albany. Save a wife Of noble mould and calm austerity. King Robert. So have I dreamt. I shall be glad when peace Commends this business; when I lay my hands In wonted blessing, often gently ask'd, On David's head. To feel the golden curls Is richer than a gilded treasury! [Exeunt. Scene IV. âAn upper room. Enter Elizabeth Dunbar and Women with flowers. Elizabeth Dunbar. This is a chamber where our pleachÃ¨d blooms Will never summer-sicken, till they crown My wedding. Fah! How damp is the gay store; Ere I unseat this rose, shake forth its dew. 1st Woman. 'Twill fall. Elizabeth Dunbar. Then let it. Ah, 'tis gone, fair cup! But I will have no weeping. 2nd Woman. None at all? Why, lady, every blossom is in tears. Elizabeth Dunbar. It shall not be. Go, take them to the fire, And lay them in the comfort of its light Until they laugh. 2nd Woman. 'Twill wither them. Elizabeth Dunbar. Take all; I'll have no mourners. Would that I were safe. [Exeunt Women. As future queen! queen! Oh, to think of it! To be the dimple on the cheek of state, The centre of all smiling and all grace; This hand a little silver shrine to bless All lips that seek it, and about my head The glory of the sun in all his pow'r. They call me fair and gracious; even now I am the pride of opportunity. Then every moment will be on its knees A servant to my charms.âI'm public. Ah! Visited royally! [Enter King Robert and Albany.] I wait my maids To bring me flow'rs to wreathe. My lords, the dawn Had made them goblets of bedewing grief I set the flames to sip. Albany [to King Robert]. Speak! King Robert. Nay, not now. Albany. Lady, the king hath somewhat he would say. Elizabeth Dunbar. Speak, sire; attention kneels. King Robert. Such winsome smiles! Oh, lady, but I would not have them win Sorrows as do the sunbeams, which receive The damps and mist of earth. Elizabeth Dunbar. A riddle, sire! King Robert. I may not dare to give you what of ill I, shamÃ¨d, have begotten; tho' the words Wring all the father in my heart. Elizabeth Dunbar. Your son! Oh never fear but I will turn him to Some sunrise transformation, give him gold And purple of new manners. King Robert. Albany, Speak; I beseech you speak. Elizabeth Dunbar. I am betroth'd; You dare not break that vow. Albany. We've weigh'd the risk, And needs must run it. Think you we dare lay Upon the recent homage of your sire The burthen of the shame that drags our house Down to the very dust! It cannot be. Elizabeth Dunbar. I'll move himâplead with him. Albany. In any case, The realm hath not assented. The Estates In Parliament assembled have not said The binding word. Elizabeth Dunbar. Oh, sire! Albany. It shall not be. King Robert. I pity you as only those can do Who say of any grief 'tis not the first. Albany [to King Robert]. Wilt please you to withdraw? King Robert. Yes, yes. [To Elizabeth.] One frost Hurts not the spring. Be comforted; my son Were an abiding blight. Albany. We'll straight descend. [Exeunt. Elizabeth Dunbar. They cast across my hopes the blackest shades. The storm must come. But now there's vacancy Before all grief and anger. I believe That I shall never hate, nor weep, nor know All that has happen'd till I fly this place Where suddenly my fate hath caught me round. Escape I must.âI never thought of itâ That I was trembling. ... Oh, I dare not yet Think of the downward steps. [Enter the Earl of March.] Earl of March. My daughter! God! Her wraith!âI come to find the king.âArt sick? It cannot speak. She's mad. Elizabeth Dunbar. Fathâer. [Falls on his neck. Earl of March. My child, What is 't? Oh, tell me you are sane, not sick, Nor supernatural. I feel your tears Scalding from life's red fires. These raging drops! Oh, what an ocean swells!âYou'd have mine ear? Elizabeth Dunbar. Reâvenâge me! Earl of March. That I will, and to the death. On whom?âNot yet! I'll wait. Within her throat The child of anguish labours. [Re-enter Women with flowers.] Elizabeth Dunbar. Oh! [Faints. Earl of March. She'll die. 1st Woman. Go to the well in haste. [Exit 2nd Woman. Earl of March. Her poor lids gape, Like the wild gates of a surprisÃ¨d town. 1st Woman. Lady, you know me? I am Kate. 3rd Woman. Look up. Poor lady, are you better? Earl of March. Hold your peace. Elizabeth Dunbar. Send them away, and all the blossoms too. The storm abhors them. ... Just one rose to crush, Red as his life. [Re-enter 2nd Woman.] 2nd Woman. O sir, it cannot be! It is not true, it never can be true! They say the prince ... O Kate! ... he's turn'd her off, And chooses Marj'rie Douglas for his wife. Earl of March. Begone, you women folk. [Exeunt. Elizabeth Dunbar. On Albany Revenge me; on King Robert and ... Earl of March. Within This fleshly scabbard I'm all sword. I'll break From execrable homage, bear my wealth, My armies, and my anger to the king Of England. [Enter Duchess Marjorie.] Woman, will you dare to flaunt Your triumph in the eyes of her defeat? Her father ... Duchess Marjorie. O Elizabeth, believeâ This ring, this bond, first link upon the chain That fetters all my days, should clasp your flesh If I had will to work it. But you see My honour's in this circle; this cold spell Hath bound it in a sleep that Merlin's fay Could whisper to no freedom. I have sworn 'Fore Heaven to keep the hateful marriage-vow Through all the burthen'd years, who have within The rigid mind of chill virginity, And am less wife than you whom bright desire Hath thrill'd with promise. By your eyes I see You will repay. Forgive me! Vengeance fall Where it is dueâupon the guilty heads That hatch'd this treason. Elizabeth Dunbar. I shall never know If you are faithless; but I hate the sight Of your black faceâthe raven to my heart That's dying at your sounds. Earl of March. God's light! You lie, Cursed brat of Douglas, lie before my face, That's lightning-furnished for the vengeful doom. How came you married in this shameless haste, Without a prick of liking? Duchess Marjorie. There is none. No spirit haunts with heavenly surprise Our wedded veins. My husband at the shrine Took with averted head my idle hand. Earl of March. You would befool us. Hence, nor mock our wrath With feign'd propitiation. Traitoress, You come to buy our peace toward him you wed At price of your own womanly reserve. We spurn the secrets of your doorless breast. Duchess Marjorie. Henceforth 'tis shut for ever. Hell's black key Nor Heaven's golden instrument shall e'er Withdraw its bolts. I'll rust in sufferance Cold as my heart and icy as my pain. If you revengeâ Earl of March. You'll join in our revenge? Duchess Marjorie. Never. Declare my rancour!âI'll be true, True to the faithless boy, who even now Hath broken plight. I am a wife in name; That name I'll keep as white as is the band On a nun's forehead. Earl of March. Get you to your pray'rs! Elizabeth Dunbar. Oh, I am cold! Duchess Marjorie. I'm sharper than the frost, And silent too. If ever I forgive, Spring will be come. [Exit. Elizabeth Dunbar. My crown, my crown! Earl of March. I'll pour The scorching embers of my rousÃ¨d ire On the king's head. Thou'lt marry Percy's son, The gallant Hotspur. We'll to England straight. Cover your eyes, and lean upon my arm. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âA Tavern. Enter Wright, Selkirk, and Hostess. Wright. Hi, hi! The mastiff crack'd your little cur. Fine bloody sport! Hostess. As I am woman born, Rascals, you set him on. Selkirk. Ho! The last grip Was none of our contriving. Merry game To have 'em tug and tear while we could fill Our cans an' watch 'em bleed. The mongrel! Ho! They tore like devils. Wright. Sweet to hear the yells O' the small beast. They told me how 't would end, An' fed my comfort. Hostess. Oh me! Bess, my Bess! You are no men, you lubber patches you! All who have man about them love fair play. 'Tis only demons crow to see the weak O'ermatch'd by brutishness. Begone! My house Is built for human creatures with a thirst For harmless wines, and not for cruel blood, Tho' 'tis a beast's poor drops. Off! off! [Enter Rothsay, Ramorgny, Walter, Ralph, etc.] My lord, They've killed my coddling fav'rite, yellow Bess. They loosed the mastiff on her. Wright. Heart! She raves! Rothsay. Dastards! Go kick them to the brinded beast, And let them taste his jaws. You growl at me, Sirrahs! Wright. Ugh! Selkirk. Heigh! Rothsay. They're drunk. Lay on your feet, And send them sprawling to the kennel there. Poltroons! Wright [aside]. I'llâvenge, revenge! Selkirk [aside]. I'll pay you, dog. [Exeunt, dragged out by Ralph and Randolph. Rothsay. Varlets!âBe comforted. I'll send thee Blanch. You know her, Waltâa toy to ease your grief. Sweetheart, a kiss! Go, fetch us cheer. [Exit. My lads, She's true and pretty, young and fanciful, Free to be kiss'd, free to be left alone, Warm as a May noon, merry as a kid. Heigh-ho! [Re-enter Ralph and Randolph. I am not thirsty. How your faces fall! Pray me to speak of marriage. Ramorgny. I for one. Walter. And I. Ralph. And I. Randolph. And I. We pray you speak. Rothsay. I will. 'Tis slavery, and round my heart Is the vile collar of my servitude. Marriage! It is a bond of ice that ties My passion's stream; it is the grapplingâay, Of hostile vessels! ... Walter. Now, friends! [Re-enter Hostess.] Rothsay. Fill, wench, fill. Let's pledge the newest beauty. What coy nymph Hath listened to thy tongue, my soothing John? Ramorgny. Faith, there's a merry dozen down the street As wide awake as nightingales, with eyes That are a flock of stars. Rothsay. We'll follow them Soon as the Court's asleep. Here's to their light! Pah! Wine hath lost its flavour and its joy. I drink it, but 'tis dirt across my lips. The more I thirst, the more I loathe the cup, Which yet I clasp the more. Sun, exercise, Laughter and song, all that was happiness And close upon my life hath faded back And fallen to illusion. Ramorgny. Here's a change! I've often heard you swear that no such thing Was in the world. Illusion! How you storm'd And vow'd it was the filming of the eye In stricken age. Rothsay. And so it is, my friends. Only Time strikes much sooner than I thought, And falsifies our nature. My true youth Is gone, the morning-red, the dew, the notes Of soft dawn's youngest confidenceâall gone; And that immortal gift of gaiety That flies with the approach of deathly years Of knowledge and experience and age. Ramorgny. Ho! You're a frosty day-spring! Search his poll; Is there a thread from Winter's distaff on 't? Ralph. Yellow intact, I'll swear. Walter. All gilded yarn. Rothsay. When once regret has breathed upon our days, Youth is a bird that flies. Walter. I'll springe the lark! [Enter a Councillor.] Who's here? A grey-beard, with the very stamp Of Age's silver currency. Rothsay. A fool, A spy on my morality. Good faith, I'll give him whiffs of nether smoke to save His search from disappointment. Councillor. Do mine eyes ... Rothsay. Or does your noseâ? Walter. Or do your earsâ? Rothsay. Or tongueâ? They are offending senses. Exile them! If you are present but one moment more, We'll bleed our casks and drown you in the tide, Till Age is red as babyhood.âThe cur! [Tosses wine in his face. Exit Councillor hastily. Ramorgny. Your uncle sets them on. Rothsay. I know. 'S blood, Ramorgny, how I hate to see him rule My country and my father and my king. He is as false as sin, himself his god, And I the rebel he must damn to reign. Ramorgny. Comrades, withdraw a moment. I have words Occasion bids me utter, which must rest Alone within the ears for which they rise On my reluctant lips. Rothsay. Withdraw, withdraw! [Exeunt. Ramorgny. There is a road, a dark and narrow way The dagger opens for our enemies. Rothsay. John, are you speaking? or are these the words Your evil angel forges on your tongue? Ramorgny. My very words, as I shall answer God. Your uncle seeks your life, and his own blood Must shield you from the loss; he seeks your rights; His power o'erthrown must pay the penalty; Or mark my words, your life and rights will line His ruthless feet, thus shod for monarchy. Rothsay. You're false as he. Ramorgny. Nay, true and politic. For Friendship is a Janus, double-faced; Truth to the right, to the left policy. Rothsay. I'll have no friend who looks not straight before; I'll have no devil in my bosom-faith, Tempter to unimaginable sin. Upon a sudden darkness of my brain Glares with hell-lighted letters Murderer; You'd brand it there for ever! Fiend, begone! I hate my uncle, but within the bounds Of honourable nature and just deed. Oh, I rejoice to tear the hood of lies From off the naked face of his self-love. But tear the garment of his flesh away With stab of secret malice! God forbid! My own soul too forbid! I've done with you If you're for plotting; and your orat'ry, Matchless in praise of beauty, music, verse, Hath in it the wasp's sting, no honey-tongue Free-feeder 'mong the sweets. Curse policy! My marriage was a plot, a gross deceit. 'Twould be a merry world if senses ruled, And brains were fettered from their craft and lies. I'll not betray you, wretch. I scorn the tongue By which you thought to pull me to your depth; How dare you dream it! [Exit. Ramorgny. To a lower depth, As low as drops the coffin shalt thou sink, Mine honest fool. That yellow sheaf of hair That's ripe upon his brow,âI'll beat it down Beneath the flail of Misery! My tongue, That hath procur'd him Pleasure by its guile, Shall wheedle Death now to attend on himâ A mistress fitted to his moral mood; She shall be tedious. [Exit. Scene II. âA Hall. Enter Albany, Lindsey, and Douglas. Albany. Government! There's no such thing in this forsaken land. To look upon the Earth and think of Heav'n Might raise the doubt that God is still enthroned. Douglas. Yea, in all things of state there is a blind, Discomforting, wide chaos. Albany. There's no power, No issue of a will;âmerely the thoughts Of unestablish'd brains. Draw nearer, friends. My brother is a saint, emasculate; His son a random boy; the sentinel Is lacking in each nature. Douglas. 'Twas our woe That you were e'er unseated. Lindsey. To my mind It was Perdition's warrant to the State Which all time since has served. Albany. Control the breath Of this our intercourse. An enemy! I know the hobble. [Enter King Robert and Prince James.] Brother, are you well? King Robert. Sickly inclined to-day. Lindsey. For that we grieve. King Robert. Do not. 'Tis scarcely pain; autumnal drought I' the sap of life. Albany. I'm sorry. [Enter Attendant.] Attendant. One without Chafes for the royal presence. Albany. Bring him in. Attendant. Another stands with chain'd and savage mouth. Albany. Him also. [Exit Attendant. King Robert. Shall I hence? Albany. No. [Re-enter Attendant with Messengers.] Speak you first. What is your business? 1st Messenger [to King Robert]. Thus doth Henry say, Your liege-lord, to his vassal:âSince you bar Your lips to homage, he will come in arms And force it from your tongue at Edinbro'. King Robert. I owe your king no enmity. Albany. His words Are proud. With open arms at Edinbro' We shall receive him; yea, surround his pride With murderous embrace. King Robert. Stay, brother, pause! Beneath these words is war conceived? Albany. It is; The marriage of two enemies to raise Seed to themselves of strife. King Robert. 'Tis rashly done. Albany. On England's part. [To 1st Messenger.] Begone! Speak you. 2nd Messenger [to King Robert]. I'm sent By March, your liege man, till you tore the cords Of loyalty in twain;âfrom the great earl Who hangs upon the margin of your land His storm of wrath, from the insulted peer, The outraged father, the determined foe, I bring the declaration that no peace Will ever tend her olive in his heart, Till he have wreak'd on you the injury Fourfold that you have wrought. [Cries within of Place for the Duke of Rothsay. Albany. Take breath, poor soul; You drive away the very air you need. All Scotland knows the fickle loyalty Of him who blows his shame from out your throat, Our recreant vassal. [Enter Rothsay.] 2nd Messenger [to Albany]. Who are you to speak? Rothsay. Ay, who? Address me. 2nd Messenger. From the Earl of March I bring defiance. ... Rothsay. To the Earl of March Take back defiance, louder in its mouth, At heart more fell, in purpose far more deep, And servant of an anger that will last Till all my hearth of life is crumbling heaps That naught will re-illume. I have no glove To cast before him; this will do as well [Flinging a handful of coins to the Messenger. For bargain-drivers and such merchant-souls As he whom you call master. Take the gold And let it chink my hatred in his ears. Yet sooth I should be just. Here's gold for you! [Flinging some coins to Douglas. What do you say to it, Lord Douglas? King Robert. Peace! David, you're mad! Be still. Douglas. I think the prince Might keep himself more princely in his speech And royal in his manners. Albany [aside]. This offence Hath given me all Douglas to my use Against the speaker. Rothsay [to Messenger.] Sirrah, to your trade! [Exit 2nd Messenger. Douglas. Farewell, my liege, and you, my lord [to Albany], and you [to Lindsey]. Rothsay. Old Insolence! [Exit Douglas. Albany. You've trodden on a mood May sting you i' the heel. Rothsay. He injur'd me With highest-brow'd contempt. King Robert. You cannot know All that you do enraging such as he With childish taunt and sneer irrelevant. I tremble for your folly; yea, my care Grows pale and quakes;âyet vainly do my words Knock at the ear of reason; such a gate You've fasten'd from your father. Albany. He's a boy Who wants the method of the schoolmaster. Rothsay. Now hear me! I'll not suffer such affronts,â The wormwood sour old Age with envious hand Mixes in Youth's red cup;âthe privilege To deal indignity where honour grows With freshest keen ascent and feels each blow To the soft pith's new core. Oh, all the shame You've struck into my being will be there, When it is open'd to its secret depth Before the Judgment-seat, and lo! old men Will answer for the sins that they have done Across the years to those in backward Time's Most lovely season. Spring has blights and winds Of killing tooth; but early manhood's plague And desolating frost is cruelty And white-hair'd check of pert decrepitude. King Robert. Son against father! Albany. Let him mock unheard. We'll turn to weighty matters. We must call Our armÃ¨d trains together, and on walls, In tow'r and fort invincible ensconce Our primest courage. Nephew, since you're styled The governor of Edinbro', your place Will be its flinty hold. Rothsay. Oh, war, war, war! Its thrilling course thro' slow and wretched veins Is godlike in its triumph. All is great I' the instant; all is rapturous and new. There's twice his wonted fervour in the sun, A hundred times more quickly moves the air, The world is changed at every trumpet-blast That sounds to arms, changed, changed from old to young; From lameness into leaping; from the doze Of chimney-corner to a fiery-eyed And sleepless energy; from palsied fears And calculated dangers to firm heart And unforeseen adventure; from smooth ease To tumbled hardship; from long days to short; From talk to action; from cold blood to hot; For all the world is young.âMy love-lorn wife, [Enter Duchess Marjorie.] I'm going to the wars. Duchess Marjorie. Indeed. Rothsay. Indeed? Ay, to be kill'd, to find a merry grave, Where I shall lie with earth-worms. Duchess Marjorie. You've not said With whom you fight. Rothsay. The devil! I don't care. I'll turn this common questioner to you More patient elders. On my very soul, Warfare is trite, familiar in her voice As all things in the world. So stale a tongue Would make Spring, Autumn; Joy, Satiety; Creation, Death; and Heaven damnable. [To Prince James.] Jamie, you like to fight? Prince James. Oh yes, I wish I were a man! King Robert. Here, James! Rothsay. I'm leperous! You shall not draw the child away like that, As if I breathed corruption; make me feel My bodily presence a reproach and taint. It is a lie, past all endurance false. I'll have him with me. Come and see me arm. You're not afraid to come? Prince James. David! Rothsay. Hurrah! [Exeunt. Albany. Lindsey, support the king. He's wan and ill. King Robert. I'm weary. Albany. Then we'll guide you to your rooms. King Robert. And bring me James. [Exeunt. Duchess Marjorie. For that old man, I own, I'm sorry. [Re-enter Douglas.] Douglas. Daughter Marjorie, a word. Duchess Marjorie. What is it, father? Douglas. Does that saucy whelp Use you with honour as his wife? Come, come! No stubborn face! Duchess Marjorie. We rarely speak or meet. Douglas. Comes he at nights? Duchess Marjorie. We rarely speak or meet. Douglas. That's repetition. Answer as I ask. Duchess Marjorie. He drinks the night out. Douglas. He shall quaff a draught Of vengeance. Duchess Marjorie. What the good? 'Twill nothing mend. I pray you do not move against my lord Merely for my poor sake. Time ever goes With steady patience. Douglas. Albany returns. Go. [Re-enter Albany and Lindsey. Exit Duchess Marjorie.] Albany. Hump! Your son-in-law is insolent. At heart he is your enemy. Douglas. The same Am I to him, the graceless libertine! Lindsey. I too. Albany. We'll make this matter for our speech. [Exeunt. Scene III. âA Room. Enter Ramorgny. Ramorgny. Still doth he use me, but with doubtful eyes, A voice of friendship with its strings untuned, And hands that shrink from juncture with my flesh. I never shall regain my ancient place In his frank bosom. That he uses me Without the grace of liking is his doom. [Enter Albany at a distance.] Albany [aside]. There is a rude fidelity about His foolish troop; they'll not report on him. But were Ramorgny flattered! Ah, he droops As if his brains lack'd opportunity.â You are not for the revel? Ramorgny. It lacks zest. Albany. You are not for such mates. It flatters you To serve the prince; his uncle holds the realm. When you are tavern-prison'd or in camp, Would it not give a purpose should you note Actions of int'rest to the chronicler, Shameful to the accomplice? Bring but word How leaks the ship; I'll put it out to sea. I know no other man for this intrigue, And counsel you as you would rise in place But as historian to attend the prince; And then concert with me how you may take His birthplace in my favour; he is wreck'd; My son a slothful bookworm, Robert's child, Methinks, in disposition. There is none In whom I can detect the faculty To sway the eddying people to the flow Of his will's current, save yourself, Sir John. Ramorgny. Your grace, I hate the prince, for injuries My tongue would bleed to tell. Albany. We first must turn With plaints and tales the father's idle mind Against his son. Ramorgny. I'm popular, your grace, And can be daring. With the prince none else Can take my place; his temper and his loves, His pleasure and his studyâall are built Upon my service. Albany. Good, divide it, friend! Ramorgny. I will. Albany. Your hand in parting. David, now I've set your evil genius to work! [Exit Ramorgny. All is in train for ruin. I'll to arms, And if he need my help, I will not march. [Exit. Scene IV. âStirling. A Courtyard. Enter Allan, Prince James, and an old Lunatic (regarded as Richard II. of England, who was starved at Pontefract). Old Man. He, he, he! I'm poor and naked. Naught Of empery in any of my limbs. My knees!âHere's carpentry; I pray you look. I am a little humble man. Allan. Alas! A pretty monarch once! Prince James. I thought all kings Had beards of holy silver down the breast, And bland, sage brows, and comfort at the heart, Such as my father ever shows us. Allan. Ah! Prince James. Why do you sigh? Old Man. Not Richard! I am Dick. He, he!âthe foe of God the King. Allan. A fool That envieth at Heaven. Old Man. God the King A' sits so safe up i' the sky and reignsâ I crawl, crawl, crawl! Prince James. Nay, Allan, lift him up. We will not see a monarch grow a worm. [Enter King Robert and Duchess Marjorie.] King Robert. O Allan, hath no messenger arrived Through all the day? No word from Albany? Why doth he hang his tented warfare up Beyond the reach of David's utmost need? Why doth he linger when round Edinbro' The English fasten with a brazen clasp? 'Tis strangely done, unnaturally done, To leave the lad to perish! Old Man. He! you're great! Dost think of change? King Robert. Oh, do not put my tongue On such a question's rack! Old Man. Go, make a grave! 'Twill change as you change, low when you are low, But make it great and high the while you live. King Robert. Old bitter king, I'll build no haughty tomb Who am a wretched worm and vilest sinner. I'd lay me for sepulture among clods, So might I purchase rest unto my soul. Prince James. Father! King Robert. Quick, Allan, run! I hear a horn. [Exit Allan. Duchess Marjorie. You heard aright. They come. [Re-enter Allan with Ramorgny and Walter.] Walter. 'Tis victory! King Robert. He's safe? Walter. Oh, bless you, sire, as glad as day, Pouring out wine to match the deathly flow Of the great toper War. Ramorgny. The ruffian foe Wrench'd at our city's girdle, but within, Our hearts were high and though in desperate case Supreme o'er insult. Through ungarnish'd streets Grey Famine dragg'd her bones, yet every man Did feed on steaming courage. King Robert. And the prince ...? Ramorgny. Was brave and headstrong. Softly be it said He sent a challenge to the English king To pick him out a hundred Englishmen To meet our countrymen to that same tune, And on the issue of the combat stake The freedom of our nation. King Robert. God above! Has he no reason, is he lunatic, A simpleton, a blusterer, a child, To play such hare-brain'd antics on a foe? Anxieties perplex and choke my thought; Fear in the cage of my close heart doth pant And flutter its weak plumage. These mad pranks Will dig my grave. Ramorgny. 'Tis but a pleasant tale Among the soldiers. Walter. By my troth, Sir John, Why did you take it from the common mouth To misbecome your lips. The merry faults Of friends are ever sacred to their band, Or woe is me for all good fellowship! Ramorgny. Nay, Walt, no treason; 'twas the marvel of't That rush'd from off my lips. King Robert. Does Albany Know of this shameful frolic? Walter. No, sire, no. He hath not stirr'd his arms from Caldermoor. King Robert. What will he say? How shall I bear his eye Who have begot this son?âA crowding noise! Allan. Of shouts and songs and triumph. 'Tis the prince. [Enter Rothsay with marshal array.] Old Man. Eyesâeyes of jailers. I must hide from eyes; They make me king again, and treat me ill, And capture me. I'll creep behind this cloak, This furry cloakâwarm prison! [Hides under the King's long mantle. King Robert. Fated boy! I'm glad he's safe at home! Rothsay. Well, Father, James! Ramorgny, jolly Walter! Duchess, there, You've not a forward welcome. Duchess Marjorie. To a back. And so you conquer'd? Rothsay. Laurels! That I did; And March is beaten back. I never knew What life I carried till the flinty days Of peril struck it outâa joyous blaze That lit my blood to gold. What ho! A check! Something amissâa frost about your air That's just blown in upon me with a hurt That rankles in my joy. You stand like men O' snow. What is it, father? King Robert. Your rash deed. Rothsay. What deed? King Robert. Your wicked message to the King Of England, whereby, as I understand, You staked upon the issue of a joust The freedom of your country. Allan [aside]. Sire, not now. King Robert. I am surprised and pained that you should stoop To such a jester's action. Do not flush And start away; I speak it out of love. Rothsay. We'll go elsewhere for welcome. Not enough The empty doorways and the cheerless board, The dull and tardy greetingâwith your words You set a canker to the triumph, joy, That rioted in blossom at my heart. You've made for me no welcomeâdearest word, The home that language raises by the voice, That the eyes light, whose doors are open hands; None of you built me thatânot one of you. Only I pass the bare unfeeling walls Behind which I was born. King Robert. Your talk shoots off From my direction, which was gentle blame Of a grave wrong.âTears! Rothsay. Come, friends, 'tis forgot We saved our country by determined arms And empty mouths. I think within the streets We'll find a younger memory. Come on! [Exit with Followers. King Robert. O God, the thought of him is ever near, The person ever bitterly apart; Yet 'neath Thy will did I beget his form, Which is the barrier to all my love. 'Tis well his mother lives not. Allan. Ah, 'twere well She were not dead. King Robert. What, sirrah, do you mean?â [Aside] They would not let me rule the land as John, My name, because 'twas ominous and sad. They call'd me happy Robert. Ah, the name Is nothing; fate is deeper-set than words. Old Man. Starved! King Robert. What a cry! Art cold? Old Man. Some folks alive Would keep a body breadless, and that's cold; For breadless, cold, and dead are all one thing. They tried to starve me in a prison once. You'll never starve a-body? King Robert. Dreary sport, This play on starved!âNo, never. Come within. The rain drips sulkily. Another horn Blows out a new arrivalâAlbany. I'll go to meet him, and unload my grief Of its unsharÃ¨d burthen, which is great. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âA Room. Enter Albany, Douglas, Lindsey, and Ramorgny. Albany. The measure must be sudden and severe, A storm that breaks not lowersâelse the mild And easy breath of our good king will blow The righteous cloud of pending chastisement Far from its destined quarter. Douglas. God forbid! Vengeance no more can wait within my soul. The prince is ready, ripe to be cut down, Full-dyed in sin; his shamelessness outspread In riot and a license beyond speech. He spends his days and nights in dalliance And sensual delights. He stops at naught. Before mine eyes and in my daughter's sight He dares salute his lemans. Insolence Profanes his royalty, and his graced rank Stoops to the reveller's corrupt degree. Lindsey. Since our last war he rages in excess, Flaunts in gay silks, is rash and mettlesome, Hungry as hawk, and lavish. Albany. But I've turned The key of the exchequer with a will Not easy to unlatch. He shall not seize The wealth I've purpose for to buy him drink, Fine clothes, and base enjoyments. I have griped His father's childish mind as in a vice, And hold it firm 'gainst prodigality And spendthrift rage. Ramorgny. Your grace, he's desperate; Swears that you starve his pleasure, which must feed On golden pieces as its honied store, Or perish. Albany. Let it perish! 'tis a drone, A slavish grasper of the yellow hoard It never gathered. Ramorgny. He's infuriate, And in his passion cuts from every belt The purse well-filled or empty; from the poor He takes his mite, from the rich citizen His cumbrous weight of merry-sounding coin. Will they or nil they, each must render up Their gilt provision for his potent need. This does he every night. Lindsey. Audacious deed! Good Albany, we pray as Justice spoke That sudden end be put to such offence. Albany. Do not entreat; the need I recognise, And only wait for opportunity To fling apart her doors in circling time For entrance of my deed.âFellow, your hest? [Enter Attendant.] Attendant. The Bishop of St. Andrews died last night At cock-crow. Douglas. That's i' the dawn. Albany. A fat divine, With lands to match the breadth of his good paunch, And gold his body's weight. How died the whale? Attendant. 'Twas apoplexy. Albany. Perished by the neck, As Death were but a hangman! Bear your news To the king's pious ear. [Exit Attendant. My brain is quick; Suggestion leaps within it, as a child Unborn, but stirred. The bishop, as I said, Was rich beyond belief, and where he goes Can nothing follow; therefore is his wealth Where he hath left itâin St. Andrews town, Which town, I pray you note, is reached by way Of wild Strathtyrumâmile or so to left Of Falkland Castle, which is mineâa hold Safe as the brow of councillor to hide The secrets that it spans. Douglas. How points this speech? Albany. Ramorgny, is the duke at feast? Ramorgny. He is. The tavern roared as I went by. Albany. You're due Among the boon companions? Ramorgny. Ay, your grace. Albany. Then go and spread report of this man's death, Drop hints of wealth, of satisfaction bright To bold adventure: say the enterprise Is perilous and promises much gold. Do this, Ramorgny, with familiar voice And stimulating laugh. Go speedily. [Exit Ramorgny. Friends, will you hence? Design with chaos strives In this mine orb; I pray you solitude. Douglas. And may it be of moment to the land. Lindsey. Amen, as I'm a patriot. [Exeunt. Albany. 'Twill work! I'll prison him before the week is out, And then! ... That cobweb, how it draws My inattentive eye; I cannot turn My glance from its magnetic central point Of all imagination.âIt is said That mighty Bruce, my famed progenitor, Learnt lessons from a spiderâpatience Through oft-retarded enterprise.âYon fly With the tight wings!â'Tis held and then ... destroyed. [Exit. Scene II. âA Tavern. Enter Rothsay, Walter, Randolph. Ralph with a bound felon.âApart Wright and Selkirk. Rothsay. Here, Ralph, your knife and cut these cords from him. Another slashâthey're gone!âOh, give it me,â You hesitateâhalf-hearted! Ralph. Well! 'tis this: He is a parricide. Rothsay. The very sin For which I loose him. Ralph. You have gone too far; There's terror in this prank. Rothsay. What, see him killed Before my eyes for self-defence from blows Of an old tyrant, whose first tyranny Was in begetting himâinitial wrong To be atoned forâhow? By lording it Over the wretched body and crushed soul? Then is paternity a monstrous crime Blind justice cannot see. Randolph. Hear him! Rothsay. I speak My very heart. This fellow shall not die For guarding life, when he who filled the flask Would empty it. Oh, shame! You're free! Ralph. He's dumb; Death's muzzled him. Untie his mouth with drink. Randolph. Ay, fetch a can! Walter. A can, a can! Rothsay. Hey there! [Hostess brings wine. Walter. Down with it! Ha! it tastes like very life. It is the blood of amity; we're friends Who share in this red tie. Felon. Too much, too much! Walter. Of comradeship and wine? Randolph. The ass! Rothsay. You fools! He's dazed. Just think! he's touched the hem of Death, The inner shroud that wraps all sense and breath. How felt you, knave, so near the dismal end? Walter. Oh, search his feelings now he's near to life And clinking glasses. Rothsay. Yet it fascinates The skeleton, while flesh is full and young; Its beggary when purple state is kept In every vein; its dolesomeness when joy Flouts summer's passing clouds; its cynic stare And disenchanted mouth's rigidity, When eyes desire and lips have troth and kiss; Its ancient chalky tinct, when red is up And dawn a-crowing in the face and limbs; Its dry and famished orifice when feasts Bubble with wine; its impotence when strength Heaves as a sea the sinews. Oh, it shows, Far dusty goal, how long will be our course. Randolph. We'll talk of sepulchres and tipple, lads! Corruption and long draughts! Walter. Hey now, boys, drink! Rothsay [to Hostess]. Pour here, pour all! Courage! We'll talk of death And dying. This professor we'll elect To the top chair. Here, gown him in my cloak; The ermine is scholastic. Ha, la, la! Wright [aside to Selkirk]. A felon. Selkirk [aside to Wright]. H'm! Best wine for him, and kicks For us!â Wright [aside to Selkirk]. Mum, mum! They'll give you to the dogs. Selkirk [aside to Wright]. No drink for us. Wright [aside to Selkirk]. They'll duck you. Selkirk [aside to Wright]. Damn the crew Felon. My soul!â Walter. No, man, your bodyâthat's the theme To which we're merry pupils. Randolph. Here's to it! Ralph. Here's to your carcase! Rothsay. Tell us how you felt When Death was on a moment's other side. Felon. Oh, nothing much!âbut rather tight ... Rothsay. As if The body hugged its kernelâghastly clip! Here's the first instance that our master gives From the last art of all. Walter. Cheerly, my lads! A health to each. Rothsay. Right heartily.âHow else Felt you, good master? Felon. Eh, sire? Rothsay. You are safe. How felt you dying? Felon. Why I cannot sayâ But like as you must pass a ghost. Rothsay. He's raised A most delicious shiver. On my soul, There's magic in 't,âimpossibility In death!âa lure that never will draw us, A wonder that will never be, a dream Cast o'er our being from the world without, And in us but a fragment dim, distraught, Of what we do not know and cannot learn. A place of marvel too forlorn for us, Where old men seek their losses, an event Which we with our new breath can never cause; A something, which is nothing to the dawn, The bud, young man or maiden ... [Enter Ramorgny.] Ramorgny. What of them? Walter. Can't die, can't die! Ramorgny. The wine hath made a way To Reason's spring. [Clamour without. Rothsay. The townsfolk at our gates! Up, up! They'd seize our prisoner! His eye Is like a hound-caught hare's. A fight, a fight! [Enter Citizens.] 1st Citizen. We'll have the monster! 2nd Citizen. Tear the parricide! Rothsay. Strike at the numskulls that hold fathers dear! 1st Citizen. The prince, the prince! 3rd Citizen. Cry shame on him! 1st Citizen. Young lord, Fie on this prank! 3rd Citizen. Justice! Rothsay. Protect the weak! [They fight. Exeunt Citizens, dragging off the offender. Traitors, you'll suffer! Rebels, on my word I'll deal it to you heavily for this!â He's precept and example too, poor wretch! My blood is up. Ramorgny. Then have I news for you. The Bishop of St. Andrews died last night. Rothsay. Mercy! You'd have us get to church and pray Our hot blood out for him! Ramorgny. Rash gaiety! Ho, ho! I'd have you seize his earthly goods, And leave immortal baggage to himself. Walter. Ay, that's our cue! Rothsay. How, how? Ramorgny. Why thus. At dawn Ride to St. Andrews, claim the bishopric, And hold it while it serves you as a purse. Rothsay. Your speech is a divining-rod; my thought Digs to the bright event. I'll start at dawn, And ride alone. Gold, gold, my cronies, gold! Walter. Let's go in company. Rothsay. I'll ride alone, For this great robbery shall be my own. Walter. Look yonder through the door! Rothsay. What is 't to see? Walter. A flare of light. Randolph. Look, look! Walter. It trails along Its hairy length of sanguine shining rays, And seeks Aquilo with terrific sweep Of baleful triumph. Ralph. Wonderful to see! Rothsay. Mathematicians say, as I've heard told, When comes this comet 'tis a sign of death Or downfall to some prince; or to some land The symbol of destruction. Walter. So 'tis said. Rothsay. Ho, la!âit hurries fiercely to its work, The rufous minister of starry fate! 'Tis ardent in the service of despair And deathâa flaming presence with the torch That AtÃ©, as our chronicles relate, Waved over Troy in bloodthirsty despite. How must the doomÃ¨d wretch be sunk in woe Who feels that skiey sword within his breast, And all his power beneath the withering breath Of yon proud exhalation with hot train Of fiery vapour! 'Tis a gallant slave To spindle-turning destinies; they are Witches to own familiar such as that Bright demon of the clouds. We'll pledge it, boys, Hold up red wine to its more red success; No matter who goes up nor who goes down. Here's to 't! Ramorgny [aside]. The sybil knows another's fateâ Is silent of her own, howe'er she prate. [They go on carousing. Scene III. âA Room. A portrait of the King over the fireplace. Enter King Robert, Albany, Douglas, and Lindsey. King Robert. I cannot. Oh, you push my fatherhood From its old chair beside my heart's red fire It's sat by many a year. Imprison him! Close him from light to which I called him forth, And send him back to unpaternal Night's Most lone possession! Tell me what the sin Can merit such discharge? Albany. Be calm. Our words Have carried tempest, and their urgency Hath told like cruel blast. Good brother, calm! I'll speak again and not belie our scope. King Robert. Do, I beseech you. Albany. Listen with your mind, Nor let your heart once hear. King Robert. 'Tis deaf, 'tis deaf. Albany. The evil that is held and never spilt, Though deadly in its essence, doth no harm; Being disseminate with its advance, It spreads its venom. So my nephew's sins, When privily enacted, hurt but him In his dishonoured self. Now are they poured Upon the woeful land; for every night He robs the various, darkling travellers. His license grows; his amorous intrigues And shriftless dissipation fill all mouths With scandal and amaze. King Robert. And he's my son! He might have been unlawfully begot, He's put me to such shame.âForgive the wrath, My buried queen! who gav'st him that bright hair, With all a cornfield's promise in its hue When looked on by a beggar. Albany. Patience! Hear! He's but a boy, and childish in offence; So would we have him punish'd with the dark, Straight, frighting walls and sudden privacy. And this but for a space, that in his pride The simple lesson may be fixed as deep As is his alphabet in memory. King Robert. But prison!âOh, I feel his sun might set If plunged in darkness, and I cannot think That he'd come out like morning; he would hate, As Rhadamanthus, that grim judge of Hell, The father who condemned him to the gloom. I'll never do it. Albany. Yet in days of old, You shut him, a scared child with wauling mouth And passionate limbs, in pitchy, crampÃ¨d space Of a lock'd closet. Punishment should grow As grows the stature and the mind of those It chastens. Storms to break the forest's will Must sweep not as they dealt with seedlings; so The narrow chamber that confined the child Must be a dungeon when he grows to man. The chastisements are similar, degree Being proportioned to the years they curb. King Robert. True, true! But doth a father's power enlarge With life's expansion in the youth he's reared, That he dare punish after that same form That served him for the boy? Albany. Thus Heaven does. The chastening of conscience pricks the sense Of infancy but as uneasy thorn; Manhood it fixes with the spear-like thrust; In kind, the sameâin measure, different. Douglas. We pray you listen, for we trust you grant The prince deserves some check. King Robert. Oh, sirs, I do. [Enter Ramorgny.] Albany. How now? Ramorgny. I've but a moment's very chink In which to speak. I must be back e'en now, Or smart among my comrades. List! the prince Is bent on holding in rash, lawless grasp St. Andrews' bishopric. He starts at dawn. King Robert. An impious thought. Ramorgny. But there is worse behind; He's loosed from death, and eaten at the board With one who slew his father. King Robert. He forgets The chain that life hath locked with heavy key About the child and parent, unto which They must be slaves, or bear the lash of God Until they perish! He forgets all this! Ramorgny. I must away. Albany [aside to Ramorgny]. And bring me privily The men you praised last night. [Exit Ramorgny. [To King Robert.] Now you will grant Necessity was prophet thro' our lips. So, so!âGood brother, you're persuaded now? King Robert. As to the state. But, Albany, the lack Of duty and respect to fatherhood! O Albany, there is no darknessânone, I'd put him in for that. Another judge Must sentence it. I'm partial, Albany. Albany. But for the state? King Robert. Bid Allan fetch my son. Leave me.âYes, yes! I know it is in vain; But let me try to touch one chord in him My nature strung. I'll see you presently. [Exeunt Albany, Douglas, and Lindsey.] The attributes of God, when bound on man, Are cruel to the flesh; His charity Doth not oppress, He never craved an alms; But a king's mercy weighs on him as guiltâ And punishment! Oh, there is very lead! To judge, to punish!âAnd the judge is frail And stain'd; the punishment is hurt and shame To one who shares with him a heart that aches, The changeful cheek, and the tomb's last disgrace. O execrable burden! God, O God! Why did'st thou bow Thy creature of an hour To carry what omniscience alone Should strike with and eternity confirm? I'm crushed; the iron power is on my soul, And on the body that begot my son, Whom I must punish.âNay, I'll win and save. Oh, I will speak with searching mildness, reach, Like the soft rain, where there is seed in him The rough blast could not touch. If I am calm Perchance ... But hark! a door was thrown ajar. 'Twere well to sit.âThat comes from his young throat. Rothsay [within, singing]. The devil is a sinner, Ha, la, la,âla! But none can hit him fair; For who would be the winner? Fa, la, la,âla! Ay, who would be the winner, When the devil does not care? [Enters.] Good even, father [lifting his cap]. King Robert. David! Ah, 'tis well You make some show of reverence. Rothsay. I'm framed To courtesy as morning to the light. I could not with a covered head insult The meanest roof. King Robert. You show me courtesy By instinct, and yet wrong its very source! You've sinned against that name with which your birth Did christen me, by taking the vile part Of one who broke his origin and mould That fashioned forth his life. Rothsay. Ridiculous! Because one parent has abused his state, Would we dethrone all others? By your leave, You can't have a good conscience, father. King Robert. That I have toward you. I ever loved you dear As sunshine or as life; have ever striven To do my part toward you; it came like joy. David, that look across your lips! [Aside.] Oh, that Curdles my love as some malicious sprite The moon-pale milk!âI've ever been to you A father just and merciful. Rothsay. Most just. O bitterest sarcasm my life can frame! Justâand you sold me to a loathsome thing You call my wife! ... and merciful! You cut My happy youth away as the green shoot That carried summer in illumined growth Ere tyrant March dissevered. Just, you say?â Who made me man and snatch from me the rights That consecrate my sex. What! merciful? And you have driven me beyond the door And threshold of your favour! Is it just To breed me to my station and deny The means to keep it? Merciful to trust Backbiters' malice, comments of dislike, And your own icy age? Just! Merciful! King Robert. The woman you have married was the choice Of Albany, your uncle; and he said 'Twas for the best, and he is mostly wise. Rothsay. Why did you trust such matter to his will If you so loved me? Your deed's eloquent Of love that's mighty little! King Robert. Oh, unkind! 'Twas for your good, and that it failed is due More to your humour and unchecked caprice Than to the harmless matron. Rothsay. Thank you! King Robert. Son, I'll bear no insolenceâas if you'd been Aught but a thankless prodigal. Rothsay [drawing his dagger]. We're quits. King Robert. David, put down that dagger. Do you hear? Obey me, put that dagger down. Rothsay. Ha, ha! King Robert. Now, David, I will be obey'd in this, As in the prohibition which I make To what you purposeâseizing on the wealth O' the Bishop of St. Andrews. At your peril You dare to touch it. Rothsay. I'll not touch, but hold. King Robert. 'Tis at your peril. Rothsay. Threats are dangerousâ To children. King Robert. And to disobedience Is due a childish punishment. You look Merely a stubborn boy deserves the whip. Do as I tell you. Rothsay [stabbing his father's portrait]. Now I've got a sheath. Obey you! Never, never, never, never! [Exit. King Robert. He's torn the painted breast that cannot bleed, While this is heaving to let out its tides By any ragged cleft. O David, David! [Re-enter Albany, Douglas, and Lindsey.] Albany. Hand me the water, Douglas. King Robert. There, there!âthere! It must be done. Albany. Lindsey, the warrant, quick! And pen and ink. [Exit Lindsey.] He passed us with an oath Fouling his mouth. King Robert. Look there! Douglas. A wanton deed, Outrageous and contemned. [Re-enter Lindsey with the warrant.] Albany. Your signature, And all is done. Here is a pen that's wet. King Robert. Where must I write? Albany. Just there. King Robert. The ink is black, As if it mourned for him; and here's the seal That shuts him from the sun and closes him In primal night. I'm thinking, Albany, The mother from whose lightless womb he came Will ne'er forgive this writing. Albany [to Douglas]. Take it hence. [Exit Douglas. King Robert. In Falkland Castle? Albany. If he rides that way. King Robert. Yes, toward St. Andrews. Albany. Falkland Castle, then. [Re-enter Douglas.] King Robert. I'll go to bed.âWell, gentlemen, you see I'm not a dotard, though I love the boy.â Bid candles to my chamberâit is dark.â Oh, oh!âOne other question, Albany: What is the dungeon like? Albany. Most merciful; No rocky pit and hold of tainted air Or unclean lifeâmerely a narrow room Whose grated window from a passage black Draws in the constant wind. King Robert. Well, well!âOnce more He'll sleep in his own bed, within the room Where as a sunny lad I've seen his face Smile, though 'twas night. I'll leave you, gentlemen. [Exit with Douglas. Albany. All's working to our end. Go, Lindsey, fetch Hither Ramorgny and his comrades. Needs I speak with them in private, and meanwhile Have horses ready; boot and spur yourself For momently departure. Lindsey. With best speed. [Exit. Albany. All is not done: as if a prison killed The nature it has fastened! He'll come forth In all the passion of galled liberty, And lord it o'er me with tumultuous spite And mischievous demeanour. I must hear His voice no moreânever! Yet gossips say Blood cries aloud against the murderer. Such call were ruinous. I'll spill no blood; He shall not have a crimson advocate To make the airy vault resound his part, And rouse the common earth to plead for him. No blood, no blood! But he shall simply dieâ Die as old men do from the life worn out; Die, not by violence, but slow degrees; [Enter Ramorgny, with Wright and Selkirk. Not broken like a glass with all its wine, But emptied, whole and flawless. Selkirk, Wright! [They approach. This good observer says you hate the prince For insults and neglect. I ask you, friends, To hate him for this gold; ay, more than thisâ By handfuls as you pile your hatred up. I see you have no tongues that you can use Before a gentleman. I therefore ask But simple âYesâ or âNoââtwo little wordsâ The longer, wealth; the shorter, poverty, With my displeasure coupled. Say your say. Wright. Yes, I'll do anything. Selkirk. Yes, so will I. Albany [giving gold]. An earnest for you each. And which of you Knows Falkland Castle? I am lord of it. Wright. I've known it from my cradle. Over there Against Strathtyrum. Albany. Ay, and there you go This very night, for ere another falls And closes in the world, the prince will lie In more enduring darkness. Wright. Prison? Albany. Ay, And tomb to be, for you will make it so By holding from the belly and the throat That which keeps life. Wright. Clem him? Albany. Your word is right. Take them away, Ramorgny; give them all The circumstances of time and place and how. Bid Lindsey to me, and return anon, For you must start at midnight. [Exeunt Ramorgny, Wright, and Selkirk. When all's done, Ended and over, I will give it out He died of wasting fever, such as oft Is shut a phantom with the prisoner To house together. [Re-enter Lindsey.] Lindsey. Here and at your will. Albany. To horse at once, the warrant in your pouch. I heard him call his servant; he's a-bed, And we must get the start. Lindsey. Long ere he comes, We'll own a briery ambush. [Re-enter Ramorgny.] Albany. Here's Sir John. Come to my private chamber, and tread soft. [Exeunt. Scene IV. âCourtyard. Dawn. Randolph in a drunken sleep. Allan and Walter. Walter. The lie-a-bed! Allan. I halted by his room. Lord, he was snoring! and when thus he sleeps, He cries out when he's waked. Walter. I'll watch no more. This time o' day puts sickness into me. The air is strange and empty, as just left By mouldy ghosts and all the crew o' sprites. Allan. A purple, sodden dawn. Walter. That's overdrunk Of water. Allan. Is he coming? Walter. Heigh-ho! heigh! Allan. A step! You hear 'em far off at this hour. Hist! Walter. He's a very sluggard. [Enter Rothsay.] Rothsay. Where's my horse? Allan. Beyond the archway yonder. But, my lord, I could not find your bridle. Rothsay. Here it is. I took it to give Jamie, for he rides This morning his first charger: give it him; He likes its fashion, and he loves me. There! Ha, ha, ha, ha! I'm making no bequest. Cheer up, old Allan. Allan. This is food for you, Some scraps of dainty meat such as you love. Rothsay. The early cold will make me hungry. Thanks. How solemn Walter looks! Walter. 'Tis a queer hour, That makes you sink within and flap your lids. Heigh-ho! heigh-ho! Allan. 'Tis five o'clock. Rothsay. St. Andrew! I am late.â Give me the food.âSee, 'tis a heavy sky.â Farewell, farewell! I'll make your pockets bright. Bid Randolph watch for me to-morrow night. Walter. God speed! Allan. God keep you! Rothsay. To you from my heart! [waving]. Father, I'm going! [Exit. Allan. Walt, I cannot think Why he's so under cloud; a little wild, But that's youth's wont, and most affectionate.â He's turning now. A thousand shames say I. Walter. Oh, 'tis his uncle's doing, and the stiff, Grave set o' the king's virtue. Let us feed, To make sure we're not standing in a dream. [Exeunt. Scene V. âStrathtyrum. Enter Lindsey, Ramorgny, Wright, and Selkirk. Lindsey. Crouch! and I'll be your watchman. Ramorgny. What sound's that? Lindsey. Some bird. Wright. The plover. Lindsey. Oh! Ramorgny. Lie close.âDown here The shade grows dull. Is't clouding more? Lindsey. Ay, fast. Ramorgny. A horse's neigh! Lindsey. Some peasant over there Lading his heavy beast. Wright. 'Tis peat for fires. Lindsey. You call it so?âA shower! Wright. Bo! a flood. There's water in all parts about your head. 'Twill fall for many a day. Lindsey. Truly. Wright. A bet! Ramorgny. There's something like the dumb show of a blast. Lindsey. It comes before a tempest. Ramorgny. I am chill. Lindsey. 'Tis heâat least a man who loops his reins Over a thorn, and throws his gaze about As looking for the way. Now, now! He turns Direct to us. All ready! [Enter Rothsay, ascending a slope.] Rothsay. Oh the joy Of being quite alone with land and air, Freedom, and Youth, and Day,â'tis otherwise With Night, but I shall reach the town ere dark. I've not enjoyed a solitary ride Till now, when I've the throbbing fellowship Of Resolution, with unhindered space Before meâ Lindsey. You're deceived. In the king's name I apprehend your person. [They surround him. Rothsay. Do you know I am the Prince of Scotland? How is this? Sir William Lindsey, and Ramorgny too! You're come to fetch me back? I'm one to four! Lindsey. Grip; hold him firm! Secure his sword, Sir John. Rothsay. Ha! You're a pack of dastards. Lindsey. Got it? Ramorgny. Yes. Lindsey. Fellows, a rope. Rothsay. I will not suffer it. You make yourselves my enemies. Lindsey. And such, Young man, we are. Draw back his wrists. Rothsay. God's sake! You will not bring me home in such a guise, Before the gaping street? Lindsey. No, certainly. Rothsay. What will you do with me? Lindsay. Convey you straight To Falkland Castle. Rothsay. Where? Lindsey. Your uncle's hold Hard by. Rothsay. Oh, take me home! Do anything But take me there. I do not mind the street. Oh, take me back! I'm ready. Lindsey. We must keep Our orders. Rothsay. Let me see the warrant. Lindsey. Here. Your father's name and writing. Rothsay. Put it up. I hate him!âJohn, they cannot mean me harm If you are here. Lindsey. Ramorgny, go and fetch Yon peasant's hack. We must proceed. Rothsay. My horse Is yonder. Lindsey. We shall want it. You must stride The work-horse that he'll bring. Rothsay. What does this mean? Lindsey. How heavily it rains! The streams will flood; 'Twere best to move at once. Come, David Stuart, These men will be your warders. Rothsay. Do not goâ Not leave me all alone with them. Good sir, I never injured you. Be merciful, And take me with you,âtake me home. I'll ne'er Offend again. Indeed I will not. Lindsey. On! Ramorgny brings the beast. Rothsay. This fellow caught My cloak. I'm drenched. Lindsey. They'll tie yon peasant's rag About your shoulders. Rothsay [to Ramorgny]. Will you suffer it? Oh, you are changed to owner of this brute, Vile traitor! Ramorgny. 'Tis a jest; they mean no harm. Rothsay. ... Ramorgny, loose my sword; You swashing blackguard, 'tis not for your use. [Ramorgny slinks off. Lindsey, you still look like a gentleman. ... Lindsey. As such condemn the thief: see to him, keep To the letter your instructions. Wright. H'm. [Exit Lindsey. Selkirk. Greenhorn! An' so you do not love our company? [To Wright.] Drag him along. Sir John has skulked away,â Speckles the distance;ânow you're left to us, Two merry knaves. Rothsay. I am forsakenâlost! What shall I do?âGood fellows ... Wright. Gulp your lies, And dine off 'em. Rothsay. My men, how far is it? Wright. Five miles, sweet boy. Rothsay. You look good fellows ... Selkirk. Ay, So says a throat that's almost stiff with fright. Rothsay. No, no! Selkirk. The liar! Hold your tongue, and come. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. âCourtyard. Enter King Robert, Albany, Douglas, and Soldiers. King Robert. No peace! Still fret the Borders. Albany. March is up, The English sway'd to northward. 'Tis for us This time to give them battle on their ground, Nor let them ravage Scotland. Douglas. Trust my arms. Your grace, I'll drive them to their scarpÃ¨d peak, And plunder every homestead. In an hour We start. Albany. You're swift, Lord Douglas. Heaven grant As sure as swift! Douglas. You doubt it? Albany. Nay, my lord; But fortune is a wheel. Douglas. Douglas the spring And axis of its going. Fare you well. [Exit with Soldiers. [Enter Lindsey.] King Robert. Lindsey! Albany. Black, travel-stained! King Robert [aside]. I will not askâ Not blab my weakness nor express my shame. A question would command my blood to rise Unkingly to my face; my voice is rough. [Goes apart. Albany. All done? Lindsey. He's safe. King Robert [aside]. That's well. Albany. And lodged within The castle's dungeon? Lindsey. Yes. King Robert [aside]. There must he stay Till, chastened by the rod of discipline, He learn to know himself. Albany. Good jailersâay? Lindsey. Yes, excellent; such do their duty well. King Robert [aside]. The father must not kiss his son henceforth, But painfully chastise. I scarce can bear To look into the face of any man With honest children of a fair repute. Albany. How yielded he? Lindsey. In passion and in fear. King Robert [aside]. I'll leave this list'ning. It will move my love To force the bolt I've strain'd my will to plant Across the door of Mercy. Albany [to King Robert]. You would hence? The matter of the prince's durance waits But time to fructify in glad event. [Exeunt. Scene II. âFalkland Castle. A Dungeon. Rothsay. Rothsay. I cannot tell if it is night or dayâ How many nights and days have gone outside, And I been hungry here. 'Tis all one night, One dream of anguish. I can only think Of bread, breadâbread!âthe pulling hot desire That ever strains to seize upon the thought And eat it into nothing. Oh, without Are many cornfieldsâand the river! God! I scarcely can remember anything But the white floods, and the last scrap of meat I emptied from my wallet. Once I fed, Could drink at will, and all the lads about Laughing together. Past all things, 'tis strange That once I laughed. Would I had ne'er been born! I'm nothing but a heap of crying bones And maddened flesh. Oh that the earth would gape! Would it were famished too!âThe holy bread, They give it to the dying ... and the taste Would make me live. But I'm forgotten clean, As I had lived a thousand years agoâ Mere unrequiring dustâand every atom Is grasping like a murderer! I'll lie Flat on the ground, for then my hunger's less, It pities my submission. On my face! They put them with it upward in the grave That they may rise; but I would fall and hide Where life can never come. The other way Is hopeâthe proneness of my head despair. [Throws himself down and sobs. Selkirk [without.] The dog is still. Wright [without.] Contented with his bones. Selkirk [without.] Ha, ha! good witâa very lively wit! [They enter.] Rothsay [springing up.] You're bringing me some food? Selkirk. It's here within. Rothsay. Give it me! give it me! Selkirk. Take it from me, then. Rothsay. Where is it? I would rather look on it Than sun or anything that eyes can see! Wright. Ho! it's about him! Rothsay. Where? I shall go mad With thinking of its nearness. Give it me. Selkirk. If you can take it from my stomach's grasp, You're welcome to it. Rothsay. Oh! With hands, knees, lips, I pray for bread; and if 'twill move your grace, I'll press the floor with brow as well as knees. Wright. King Selkirk! bless us! Rothsay. As you're men, and made In this poor fading image; as you have Lipsâflesh that fails, as fire at curfew-time, Unless 'tis fed; as you have appetite, That struggles like a lion in his net Till the first mouthful frees it; as you've blood, That is a river dried by famishment; As you have teeth, tongue, stomach, all the parts That give us glad renewal; if you've known Faintness and hollow suffering and thirst; If you have seen the table spread, have drunk Your fill with friends, have tasted the cold brook Or seen the harvest grow, pity my want, My pain, my tortured memory. Selkirk. How fine We talk for belly's sake! As to your feasts, I've seen you with your swinish company Rocking the bench from which you thrust us out To the mastiff i' the yard. Wright. We'll cast you now Back to your barking stomach. Rothsay. Pity me! I am so youngâso young in my desire For foodâso strong, so helpless are my pangs. Have you fed children?âI am scarce eighteen. I've all their need. If you will fetch me bread, I'll love you better than my father. Selkirk. Ay, That were small love, and scarcely worth a kick. [To Wright.] Come, we'll begone; our dinner's on the air. 'Twill taste the betterâla!âfor this lean talk. [Exeunt. Rothsay. Bread, bread! The mocking stones! [Flings himself on the ground. Would I were old, With one weak thread to crack and so to die; But, oh! the mighty cable of my youth That knots me to despair!âI ever thought Death was a shadow.âI myself am Death. I fed and never knew it; now I starve. Here is the skeleton I've seen in books! 'Tis Iâthe knarled and empty bones.âHere, hereâ The grinning dints! I thought Death anywhere But near my life; and it is in the pith And centre of my body. Horrible! I was conceived, shaped in Mortality's Own ribb'd and ghastly image; but the bread, The bread that is denied me, hid the thing I amâit clothed me. I am naked now. Its clothes I want to dress this skeleton, And wrap it from my sight. Death is not dead; O God! he lives in meâin me must die; And I must watch him with these burning eyes, Like candles set aflare upon my corpse. Hell? Hell itself to this were Paradise, For there there is no waiting for an end, Heart-wringing expectation of a term To madden'd vigil. Would I were in Hell, Immortal and contemned. Ah, torturing fires, They're in my brow; come out and circle me, So only I may burn with you, nor stop To all Eternity.âA sound outside! Out in the blessed world where there's the sun, The fresh-grown wheat, the wild carousing wind, Man's gay, habitual intercourse, the chime Of frequent laughter, happy wonted sleep, The daily meal. Bread, bread! I cannot starve, Grow strange to all that gave me joy. O Earth, Sprout me some strangled grains here in the dark; For see! I die because I have no bread.â Bread, bread! Oh! oh! Woman [without]. Now prythee hold thy peace! A cur at midnight has not sharper throat. Peace, peace! Rothsay. They're starving me. ... Woman. Then come this way. I've got some tiny oaten cakes. But mind! No yelping!âLord, to have it follow you!â Now thou'lt be still? Rothsay. As death, if I may live. Where are ...? Woman. Here, here! I'll slip it through the bars. Caught it? ... Nay, honey, do not eat so fast. My word o' faith! It is a youngsterâthisâ An' thin as trees i' the winter. Rothsay. Moreâone more! Woman. Thereâgently! 'Tis so dim. His poor pinched sides Have known some soft embraces. Hey, to think He is not in his coffin! Rothsay. What? Woman. Nay thenâ Rothsay. Another one! Woman. I'll put thee all I have. Rothsay. But you will come againânot let me die, Go to that other prison, where the worms Cling like a second famine, and the walls Are built as firm as these, but have no bars Where comfort can slip in. Woman. I'll come, poor lad. What is thy name? Rothsay. DavidâPrince David. Woman. What! Our bonnie wicked prince!âour madcap prince, Of whom they tell such tales! The Lord above! How came you here, my liege? Rothsay. I cannot tell. My father sent me. Woman. Good King Robert? Rothsay. Yes. Curse him! Woman. Hush! hush! Rothsay. It is a father's deed. I thought to foster was his very charge; Even the beasts do that. But you are come, And have so kind a voice. Is 't possible To let me have some water? Woman. How, my lord? There is no jug will pour between the bars, Nor any vessel. Rothsay. I shall die of drought; And the bread makes it worse. My lips are stiff As clay in August. I can eat no more. There, father, to your face! [Throws down a cake. Woman. Patience, my lord, I cannot think he knows. Rothsay. He's cast me off, Prey to the thirst and hunger he has chained Within me from my birth! He's slipped the leash! Help me! Woman. I'll do the utmost woman can. [Aside.] There's Emmeline the armourer's wife.âBe sure I'll help you if I can. Rothsay. Then I shall live, Live and be young againâperchance escape. I will be patientâthere's the sound of life Within your voice; it wakens me. You've seen The sun to-day, and I shall see 't again. You've brought me hope.âI cannot talk. Woman. Nay, nay.â Bless me! His eyes still ask!âI'll come anon. [Exit. Scene III. âAnother part of Falkland Castle. Enter Emmeline. Emmeline [sings]. Death hath ta'en my child to nurse, Yet he keeps his shrill small cry; Death would choke him in his hearse, Pat of earth his lullaby; But my baby cannot rest While the milk leaps in my breast. Death must come with famish'd mouth, Draw the bubbling draughts away, Ere he still the baby's drouth, Turn the pucker'd lips to clay; While the white drops trickle down, Death will ne'er uncrease his frown. Come, then, Death, and dig a grave At my heart's spring, ere it burst Its twin-brimming fountains brave At the wailing of his thirst; Quiet in your arms he'll stay, If you drain his life away. [Enter Country Woman. Woman. Now sweet good soul ... Emmeline. I must not speak with you. Woman. 'Tis pert for such as I to say a word; But answer me one thing, good mistress, one,â Have you not heard strange cries? Emmeline. I thought the birds Were noisy; but 'tis clearer and distressed. I've heard it many times. Woman. 'Tis not the birds, But a poor soul that's caged. Emmeline. A prisoner? Woman. Ay, mistress, an' they're clemming him to death. If you could see him, mistress, look on him! His hair is tattered like the yellow fern On our December wolds; his cheeksânay, hear!â As snows in thaw are dwindled, an' he weeps. He's but a youth, and, mistress, he's our prince. Emmeline. Then let us help him. Woman. I have ta'en him cakesâ You know how fine we make 'em, an' 'twas well The prison-bars are close. I fairly quaked To see his greed. But he is thirsty still. Emmeline. We'll take him drink. Woman. Alas, the bars are close Beyond all hope, poor soul! Emmeline. Can we do naught? Woman. I cannot, mistress ... butâ Emmeline. You think I can. I'm ready. Woman. But you never will forgive That I should tell youâ Emmeline. Do not frighten me, Or say to me aught I must never hear. What can I do? Woman. Give what you gave the child ... I speak it not in lewdness ... but your milk Is all the charity that God will grant.â I'll go away. If you should wave your handkerchief, I'll come An' take you to the place. [Exit. Emmeline. He is not pure. None mention him with honour, and the woman Who pleads for him hath lost her holy fame. It may be she'd beguile my innocence, And draw me into sin with pity's net. But still it was not in her look or words; For falsehood leaps not thus within the eyes, Nor from the mouth springs forth; it ever comes With tardiness and caution. She is true, And then ... O woman's shrine on which God lays A husband's faith and a babe's confidence, White altar for Love's consecrated gifts, Could Pity desecrate the pale retreat Of modest wedded peace and motherhood?â The milk is throbbing in my breast, to stay The grief of hunger. Oh, I must not close The fountain of God's mercy with rough pride, For He will keep it holy, and the eyes Of misery are pure. In our dread times Of war and woe, too many are the veils Raised from our easier days that I should shrink To stir my clinging wimple. I will go. He had a mother once, and as her child I'll think of him and go.âMy handkerchief. [Re-enter Woman.] Woman. The saints be with you! Emmeline. Take me where I go. [Exeunt. Scene IV. âThe same. A Dungeon. Rothsay and Emmeline. Rothsay. Do not leave me yet.â Emmeline. I'm called. Rothsay. You must not put me from the milk, And leave me. God! I'm fed with innocence, And like a baby fall upon my sleep. Keep close! Emmeline. My lord, lie down upon the ground; It may be you will rest. Rothsay. Ay, if you watch. I cannot sleep alone. The very air is starved and shrieks at me For the want of human breath. Oh, let me feel The succour of a voice. Put me to sleep With some soft cradle-words. Emmeline. My memory Is crazed; I cannot think of them. Woman [without]. Oh, fly! Mistress, be quick, there is the sound of steps. Rothsay. Unless you watch me, Slumber will not come, For I should be too secret to be found Of one so blind. I cannot lay my hands On any of my senses; all's confused; All's lost. ... I've got one little cake within my vestâ I shall forget where I have hidden it, Unless you watch. It's growing dizzy now, And you keep drawing back. Emmeline [turning away]. Lie down, my lord. It's rest you need. Woman [without]. Oh, mistress, we are lost! Rothsay. What! You are come again! Emmeline. To bid good-night, And settle you to sleep: you'll say your prayers? Rothsay. I have no prayers; I'm back now to the child. ... It's a land of milk and honey. ... Oh! I drowse. ... Don't stir! Emmeline. He's breathing heavily; he's gone. Woman [without]. They're on us! Emmeline. He's asleep. Now may Iâ [Enter Wright, Selkirk, with the Country Woman.] Selkirk. Hang! Woman. For pity's sake, save her! She's kind and young: 'twas I that forced her come With story of the pain in yonder cell. She came not of herself. Wright. Nor by herself Shall feel the noose. The gallows carries two, Old nurse of Satan! Woman. You are beasts, and worse Because you look like men, to starve the child Within thereâpinch his bonnie youth and wring Tears from his royal eyes; and then to hang This dearie. ... Wright. Ho! a cord! She'll deafen us. Sly harlots! Selkirk. He's spent everything on such. Now 'tis your time to pay. He's bankrupt, lass. Emmeline. These insults worse than kill me. Woman. Hold your tongues, You savages! Selkirk. Old watch and bawd! Emmeline. Ye heavens, Make haste to end my hearing! Wright. Off with them. The deil! He's gone to sleep. Spite o' the bars, You've charmed him. Emmeline. When he wakes ... and oh! we're dead I must not think. Woman. He will not wake again. Heaven bless you! he will wake in Paradise. Ye murderers! you'll have it hot in hell. God's mother, curse you! Emmeline. Hush! we will not speak. Let us die still. Selkirk. Cords! cords! Wright. Then gurgle out Your devil's threats! Emmeline. Oh! ... if my Henry comes, He'll find me dead and learn about my death; He will not like it here; but when he's taught A little of the angels, he will smile And take me to his arms. I'm ready now. [Exeunt. Scene V. âKing Robert, and Prince James on the hearth, Albany, and the Duchess Marjorie. King Robert. The wind is raging! it afflicts my head, And stirs it to confusion. Albany. A wild night For those not warmly housed; of dark presage To our camped soldiers if they couch to rise To-morrow to a battle. As they lie, Their death-shrieks like pale ghosts will stride to them Across the wailing air, andâcurse the fools!â Unman them for the fray. King Robert. O Robert, peace! I shudder.âDraw up nearer to the fire. An ingle-nook is gracious at such hours, When all are gathered round it. Albany. Truth! The glow Is pleasant, and doth ruddily assure The heart of safety. King Robert. 'Tis a black, black night. D'you think it cold? Albany. Scarcely for March. King Robert. And yet The blaze is welcome. Albany. 'Tis a trifle chill For those of fearful mind. King Robert [aside]. Then he is coldâ James, shall you be afraid to sleep to-night In all this noisy darkness? Prince James. Father, no!â I'm not afraid.âMy noble hound, you've got A comfortable ear. King Robert. The dauntless child! Albany. Our army will be routed by the air Before it face the English. May to-night Find it within some guarded vale that's slow To open gates and parley with the storm. There snaps a limb of some aghasted oak! The Devils make Inferno of our woods. King Robert. Hark! Listen! [Aside.] Oh, I wonder if he wears The little relic that his mother tied About his neck. Albany. I'm speaking of the troopsâ King Robert [to Prince James]. Will David sleep like you? Prince James. He fears the dark. And, fatherâ Albany. James, you're pressing on the dog. His sides can scarcely bear your elbow-joint, Though willing for your head. Duchess Marjorie. Is he asleep? Prince James. No, no; not he! He's listening by the fire, As we are, to the rattle out of doors. Albany. Ah, as I told you, when my words were crashed By falling of the oak, our army lies In danger from the weather. King Robert. My poor lad, My David, who is fearful of the dark, Would he were here this bleak and scolding night! He used to throw a cushion on the floor, And lay him down as featly as the hound, His foolish yellow head against my knee; And so he'd laugh and chat and sing old songs, Or gaily sneer at our last grave debate, Drop sudden crude suggestions that anon Our older counsel ripened into act; Until for some light word I'd give rebuke, When either with a peal of raillery He'd toss me back a penitent bright face, Or with a shaded humour spring apart, No place from me too far. Good Albany, You would not have our Rothsay longer shut In such grim-tempered darkness? Albany. Fifteen days! 'Tis but a slender punishment, my liege. King Robert. Enough, enough! The terror of this night Doubles the term of his captivity, And makes of it a month. Albany. We'll send for him Before the week hath touched its sacred goal. [Aside.] By this he must be dead. King Robert. Why now I'm warm in spirit, which the fire With all the urgent comfort of its face Could not effect; I'll send for him anon. [Albany paces the room. How glad I am in soul! Yet I confess I'm half afraid to meet him. Now all's well, I'll think of him no more. [Enter Allan.] Allan. Your porridge, sire. King Robert. Put it away, I have no appetite; The turmoil makes me disinclined to eat. Good Allan, set it on the hearth and stir. Have you all supped? [To Albany.] Why do you pace about? Albany. My foot is gone to sleep. King Robert. When did you sup? Albany. Like you, I have no stomach for a meal. [Aside.] All that I eat is heavy in my throat, As if I gulped the bait on Hell's own hook. [Re-seats himself. This rain will smear our army's pride. King Robert. Too sure. Yet are the troopers hardy and rough-bred, Trained by strict weather to all skiey chance, And led by one whose buff coat of bull's hide Enfeebles all the water of the clouds, And makes it folly. Prince James. Black old Archibald! Allan, he is a mountain, and his voice A waterfall.âGive me that oaten lump Upon your spoon.âThere, dog!âanother one!â Mouth open! King Robert. Allan, stir the embers up; They lay themselves to rest. Prince James. A blaze, a blaze! Brave! They put out red tongues, and roar for food Like the big lion. King Robert. But the wind is shrill Above their noise.âWhat's that? [Shriek without. Albany. What? Allan. Some one dies;â Mother of Christ!âfor look you at the dog; He shivers as an ague, an' his whine Is like a sinner's, drowning in hell's pitch. The Banshee! Hark! Duchess Marjorie. Allan is credulous. 'Tis an old story when the wind is sad, And wails about a corner. By the tower I've noted that it cries most audibly. King Robert. Ah, Allan! how you struck upon my fear, And thumped on it as 'twere a crazy drum. Brother, a woman is more rational Than three old men. Allan. Well, sire, I know the wind Hath got no breast from which such grief can moan; An' why, sire, should the dog be scared with things That touch not man? King Robert. Nay, nay, but he is still. [Shriek repeated. Again, again! It is a voice, my God!â You know it, Albany; your eyes are cow'd, You cannot lift them, tho' you shake your head. It calls me, calls!âAllan, you say the voice Is full of death and direful prophecy. O Allan! do you think you know its tones? Duchess Marjorie. The same the blast makes ever when like Jews It lifts its lamentations by a wall. Albany. I think 'tis so. King Robert. Think, think! But is your thought The very cause? or do the elements Speak out what we are deaf to in our souls, And force a hearing? Albany. Should I know? How? why? This is mere fooling. Mass! D' you think of me As privy-counsellor to Doomsday, man! It may be hurricane; it may be speech. [Shriek third time repeated. King Robert. It is his voice!âYour shoulder, Albanyâ Open the door! No matter if I fall. Will it not openânever? Does it keep me Like a tomb's gate eternally at stand? Burst every lock! [It opens. David, my son, my son, thy father hears! Thou shalt be freed, shalt come to me again. Nothing shall hinderâchains, nor bars, nor bolts; Nothing shall dare oppose my tyrant love That binds and looses. David, thou art free This moment. I have heard thee call, my son, And all my soul hath answered thou art free. Albany. Come in! The madness of this howling air Hath made you its interpreter. Come in! Let it rage on in accents of its own, And give it not our language. Come away! King Robert. He calls no more; his misery is done, For I have promised comfort and release. Albany [aside]. This burthen on my shoulder is too much. Brother, you lean With desperate weight on me. A lighter hold! Pr'ythee, to save my breath hang not so hard. King Robert. The very soul of hearing finds no sound, No slightest human sigh in all this wind. Albany. Now shall you in with me. King Robert. How dare you put My son and I apart? Albany. The wind convicts! If you give ear To a chance spasm in the air to fix On me a guiltiness ... King Robert [still listening]. There may be more. Duchess Marjorie. They are possessed. I thought that Albany Had nerve and reason stronger. Allan. The king's hair Flies round like foam; his breath is much distressed. We must entreat him back,âan' yet to stir Seems irreligious. Prince James. I will go. Stay here, And I'll beseech him shut the door again. King Robert. Nothing! 'Tis gone; and yet I fancy still It bleats upon the air. Albany. No; on my soul, All's over. ... King Robert. Stay! Albany [aside]. I've said it audibly. My lips have witness'd 'gainst me. Prince James, Father, sir! You're cold and weak to bear this chilly gale. Do not stay longer out. King Robert. I will not, boy. James! Albany. You are wise to move. King Robert. My child, your hand. Albany, shut the door [returns to his seat, led by Prince James]. And, boy, to bed! It was the wind that shrieked. [Exit Prince James. Duchess Marjorie. Well, heard you aught But windy fret and uproar? Albany. If my liege Will pardon, I'll go start a messenger To Falkland, that your mind may be at peace.â [Aside.] This wanton blast beguiles me. Conscience is A fool o' the weather and the time o' night.â I've your authority to send this man? King Robert. That of my fatherhood and royalty, Which hand in hand instructs you so to do. Albany. I will; and if we do not meet againâ As I'll retire to restâgood-night, my liege; And keep your mind from brooding on the fears Absence and Love, with magic craft combined, Both sorcerers, have raised for us this eve. King Robert. Robin, good-night, if you can shift to sleep. [Exit Albany. Cries in the whirl of night bode ...? Duchess Marjorie. Nothing. Allan. Death. King Robert. I think you are mistaken thereâdistress. Allan. As you will, sire. King Robert. And are they near of blood, Or even kin at all for whose decease The air is said to toll? Allan. I scarcely know. But I should say for any fate hath put Near to our int'rest, sire. King Robert. Then may this groan For Douglas rive the throbbing atmosphere. The army on whose welfare I have set My nearest hopes may, at this very hour, Perish in blood, their leader struck to earth, With none to ring a dirge but senseless gusts. Duchess Marjorie [aside]. He almost smiles. Ah! deepest selfishness That would prefer the doom of honest souls, Led by a great and high-deserving chief, To loss of its own pampered libertine.â My father by the law, you give to fate Him, who by nature is my father's self. I am his daughter; but I'm blunt in soul, And you so tender-strung that, at all cost, You get you comfort. King Robert. Oh, I'm base indeed For such oblivion to cross my sense As hid your dear relationship to him I fancied slain. Duchess Marjorie. Nay, I am used to such. King Robert. My girl, forgive me, for you cannot know What it is works within a parent's breast; 'Tis the begetting makes the difference, And so my passion grew. Duchess Marjorie. Your subjects? King Robert. Hush! This is all talk; we'll build no argument On these disjointed rumours of the storm. Your father is not bleeding. Cheerly, lass! All's well. [Exit Duchess Marjorie with a distant obeisance. 'Tis very quiet out of doorsâ Unnatural!âI'll go and look at James. [Exit. Scene VI. âSame Apartment. Enter Walter, Randolph, and Allan. Walter. Nothing from Falkland? Allan. Nothing. Walter. From the wars? Allan. Nothing. Walter. An empty mouth, an empty mouth! Allan. Better than have it filled with bitterness. I look for no good news. Walter. Thou croaking man, Thou raven, soul of evil augury, Wherefore bad news? Allan. It is the feeling, man, And the dull sky. Walter. God bless your sense, I feel As merry, ay, as merry as the morn, The cricket, lark, or any earthly thing That figures my condition; and the clouds From sullen flash to gay as seconds pass, So I can build my humour on the sky As well as you. Randolph. You can, my chanticleer! Walter. Marry, as thus: the prince will home again, The king for very love will give him gold, The gold will give us feast and merriment, And jolly cups and wenches' jocund lips; All these delights in turn will give us heart To celebrate authentic victory Of Scotland o'er the bragging English hinds. [Enter Ralph.] Ralph. O lads, defeat! Walter. Come, come!âan ugly game! We'll play at victory, if play we must. Victoria! Ralph. All's over, all is lost; Douglas a captive, with a gored right eye And spouting wounds; our host but helpless limbs And bleeding impotence that cannot meet The wing'd attack of the mere birds of Heav'n. The English Hotspur and our traitor March Fell on the trustful bands, adorn'd with spoil, And shook them to the nakedness of death. Allan. Where fell the woful chance? Ralph. At Homildon. Walter. Allan, thou wry-faced prophet, I have done! The prince will next be either churchyard's corpse Or church's convert. I will never speak High-stomach'd language more. Randolph. How went the fight? Ralph. Why thus:âour Douglas, in audacious fit (Foolhardy as his wont), in fated hour, Bore up our army to a topping brow Of moorland, naked, tree-unbonneted, And open to the arrows' swift assaultâ There held our men a target to the foe, A troop for slaughter; till a voice arose That thrill'd the pulseless manhood of our host With surgent valour,âhigh it rose and clear Above the whizzing darts, the foeman's yell,â Higher, as if it scorn'd opposing soundâ John Swinton's knightly voice that cried aloft: âWhy stand we here as stags upon the hill, Dart-stricken brutes, when down these drenchÃ¨d slopes Naught hinders that we rush upon the foe To fight as victors or to fall as men?â They wake; they gather with a forward sway; Death is forgotten, ay, and deadly feud; For young lord Gordon, whose good sire was slain By Swinton's hand, unmindful of revenge, Bow'd down and pray'd for knighthood from the sword Proved mortal to his house; for âne'er again,â Said he, âshall I encounter one so brave.â Amid the surging bands he said the vow, Received the hasty stroke; then with a rush The two fair soldiers clave them out a path To th' English centre and were overborneâ [Enter Albany and Lindsey.] Albany. With all our host. 'Tis miserable news! [Lindsey draws him apart. Lindsey. The streets are full of citizens grim-brow'd, With rancour in their throats. Albany. I like it not That thus they are incensed; for in such mood There's not a crime, however strange and black, But they will hang it on their rulers' necks To make a shame at which to point and jeer. Lindsey. It carries danger, as your grace conceives, And much I fear what other news may come. Albany. Ay, Lindsey, there's the peril's very head. We must be firm and stablish'd in our looks, And in our speech most sad and circumspect. Yon is Ramorgny, and the messenger I sent upon his heels to slay the men Who did the deed that never must be known. [Enter Ramorgny and Messenger.] Good news from Falkland? When returns the prince? Ramorgny. Never! Albany. A most impossible, loathed word! [Aside to Ramorgny.] Colour your ashen cheeks, you raving fool!â What, in my castle do you say he died? Messenger. It was a sort of dysent'ry, your grace. Ramorgny [aside]. Oh, if it were!âhis face impeach'd my soul, A keen, malignant, bitter, cursing faceâ Albany. Have they yet buried him? Messenger. Your grace, they have, With private ceremonial. Albany. Where? where? Messenger. Lindores. Ramorgny. And there he lies with the quick fiends Bound in his stony clayâ Albany [aside]. Tame your wild face!â Fronting this doom I stand so terror-struck That wail and grief are cow'd as childish things Before an elder agitatiÃ²n. The king! Lindsey. I dare not think.â[Advancing to Walter,] The prince is dead. Walter. What, the dear prince! Allan. The kind young prince! Ralph. Our mate! Allan. His spirit pass'd away that stormy night. Did he die hard? Albany. Why? Messenger. No, 'twas short and fierce, A feverous infection. Allan. Prison-caught? Oh, the poor king! Walter. Mine eyes are wilful, Ralph. I loved him. An' he'll drink a rouse no more. Ralph. Our days are over. Randolph. We'd best go repent; For there's no liveliness in any sin, Or chink of coin within our company. Ralph. I'll treat thee to a flagon for his sake. Randolph. An' while our throats are moist we'll pipe a mass. Ralph. Nay, pardie; but we'll give the priest his cup, And set him to the chanting. Randolph. Come your way. [Exeunt. Albany. This is the very hour my brother stirs. He will be here anon, and who will speak? Lindsey. Not I, your grace. Ramorgny. [aside]. Nor I, by my lost soul. Messenger. Nor I, for all the worth of very life. Albany. Varlet! Messenger. The torture shall not move my lips. Ramorgny. Death shall not force my tongue to utterance. Lindsey. Ruin and exile shall not ope my mouth. Albany. Then must I do 't. Lindsey. You must, your grace. Ramorgny. And will. Messenger. We humbly pray you. Albany [aside]. How my flesh is thrill'd And my speech curdles. Let me face the deed One moment and grow strongâthen bury it Beneath the soil of consciousness so deep The death-bed quake alone can rive the sod That over-presses it. With this resolve I have built up my fortitudeâI will. [Enter King Robert, Prince James, and the Duchess Marjorie.] King Robert. O woe is me for a defeated king! In vain they changed my name from woful John To favour'd Robertâvainly was it done. Ye are all silent. Is it fond respect To hoary shame and vanquish'd royalty? No wonder that your brows are black to-day. Albany. It is the mournful badge of minds bereaved. King Robert. Many the dead to mourn. Albany. One more, my liege. King Robert. Is my son well? Albany. Ay, as we count it bless'd. King Robert. Not dead? [Pause; Exit Ramorgny wildly. Allan. Sweet majesty, at peace with God. King Robert. Dead, dead! You tell an old man he is dead. I've look'd on in a cradleâwho was full Of light and movementâwhen? Whom I begot. Help, help! I'm sinking!âWhither? To the depths To find him who for evermore is gone?â No end to where I sink! [Faints. Albany. A pillow here! Raise up his headâthis is unmanly grief, Tho' eloquent for pardon. Chafe his hands. We'll keep a silence till the fit is pass'd. King Robert. Oh, I shall never find him. I have gone To deepest depths of Hell and utmost spaceâ For higher there's no warranty to go.â Still he may be at Falkland. Albany. Brother, no. At Lindores is he buried. King Robert. Put from sight!â God help my unbelief! Allan. Be still. He prays. Duchess Marjorie. When did he die? Messenger. The night of the great storm. Duchess Marjorie. Of what complaint? Messenger. A fever. Duchess Marjorie. And you said He's buried? King Robert. Stop this catechism! Stop! A king's command. She's had no offspringâshe! Duchess Marjorie. None. King Robert. Allan, ask them if he died a-bed, Or on the floor as he had been a dog, Who was my first begotten? Messenger. There was straw. King Robert. Shut his vile mouth! Albany. Control this lawless grief. King Robert. How dare you speak who sway'd my anxious love With sly, Satanic counsel; you who drew The net you forced me spin about his life; You who, miscall'd my brother, art my foe, A murderer, false witness. 'Twas your speech Beguiled my fatherhood; 'twas in your fort, Your nest of bloodshed, that my son breathed out The last of his short days. Traitor, begone! I read you through and through. Albany. I will not stay. My pride instructs me, till this rage is out, To spare my ill-starr'd, guiltless presence. Thus I take my leave, till calmer thoughts shall claim A penitent recall. Be comforted. King Robert. A hard-mouth'd, shallow wish! O Albany, 'Tis but the sword's point that is in my heart; All the long cruel blade has yet to cut. [Exit Albany. I know not how to grieve; but time to come Will find me perfect at it. This is strange, That all my sorrow is but prophecy. Allan. Could he but weep! Cries [without.] Curses on Albany! The traitor! murderer! our prince, our lord! King Robert. My David, thou wilt never be a king. God lets me put that little strip of balm About my bleeding love. It falls on thee, [Clasping James] My last, last son, the whelming heritage, On thee, who still art mine! Here, to my breast, And let it feel possessionâcarry it, And crush it into permanence! Allan. He weeps. The red grief stains his lids. King Robert. Thou shalt not go, As went thy brother. Oh, to think he's dead! Within his fair and newly-fashion'd case The pendulum of life no longer moves; His face no longer answers to the hours, Marking with lips and eyes their various flight; Time has no mirror in his countenance; There is no voice in him to sound its lapse; The cunning clock of his mortality Is stopp'd for ever, and my heart hath lost The count of all her days. Prince James. Oh, do not weep! King Robert. Not till I have my privacy. I'll go Straight to my inner chamber. Allan, come, Whom I must burthen with this grievÃ¨d frame. [Exeunt. Walter. Well I believe that Albany is false. He never loved the prince. I've deadly fear That there hath been foul play. Oh, if there has 'Twill be reveal'd; for sin doth ever blab And show the woman thro' its darkest crafts. To think that all our merriment is done, Our youth closed up and seal'd; our comrade gone To lie beneath the ground where we must go. [Re-enter Allan.] How fares the king? Allan. But just beyond the door He fell at once into a second faint, And so was borne to bed, where now he lies As if extinct. I am suspicious, Walt. Let's go and hear what rumour holds the crowd. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âEdinburgh: Room in the Monastery of Holy Cross. Enter Walter and Allan. Walter. His grace of Albany will soon be here; He comes to be acquitted by the king Of any share in God's prerogativeâ A natural death. Allan. Keep down thy bitter voice; No man creates a fever. Walter. Not so sharp! I think thy speech is full as sour as mine; Man cannot starve his fellow; he's too soft And pitiful for that. Allan. Oh whisper me, If you must blab street tales. Walter. No fear to speak What opes the general lip and blanches it. Think you, mine Allan, that the king hath heard How all men say his elder son was slain. Allan. Ay, Walt; he will not eat until we name Prince James; then shudders through his ancient form, And groans within the hollow of his chest, âStarved, starved!â I never knew so large a grief. You lose the man within his sorrow's might. Walter. Oh, here he comes, as if he'd slept in tombs. Poor royal father! [Enter King Robert.] King Robert. Everything prepared. I think my brother will not keep me long; I'm troubled that I spake so hastily To one of my own blood; it raises fear, And makes my conscience feverish and ill, To think how I accused him in my wrath. It cannot be; I ever found him kind. And his high office breeds in common souls Tale-bearing envy.âYou once served my son, If I mistake not? Walter. Sire, I loved him well. King Robert. Allan, this knave shall wait on meâyou two Who both have loved my son.âD' you know, last night I dreamt of him. Within the monast'ry Of far Lindores I saw the straight cold tomb, And the straight formâall the round lines of youth, The full serenity of cheek and chin Cut clearer in the moonlight's marble mould; The brow a blank page of the whitest peace; Yet round about twirled a dim company, Grey sprites of Famine, shaking poppy-stems And stalks of corn that wagged their lavish heads, Deriding the lean body underneath Its effigy, that still and satisfied Lay close against the wall. God! to that tomb My love is pilgrimâwith my heart's red drops Telling an awful penance. Walter. My dear lord, And new kind master, do not ever dwell On such grim churchyard thoughts. We've heaven and bliss. King Robert. I cannot yet go further than the tomb; There lies the ruined body that I built, The fair new city where I sent my hopes, Carrying fire from my own shrine of life To settle and increase. Yet I, even I, Put out the hearth and overthrew the home And pierced the very heart of my desires. Allan. His grace your brother comes. You'll take your seat Upon the dais yonder, whereto flock The people of your household; see! [King Robert seats himself. King Robert. I live Within this painted nothingnessâthis world That stares into mine eyes and holds them not, This insolent, vain show. [Covers his face. Allan. We'll stand aside. [Enter Albany, Lindsey, and other Nobles with their trains.] Albany. My liege, I break your meditation For nothing less than honour, for amends To stabbed and bleeding innocence, yourself Have wounded first and foremost. These, your lords, My peers and gracious equals, do acquit My dear renown from stain of that dread crime Whose breath would smirch my whiteness. Parliament, After all due enquiry, strictest search, And earnest fanning of the fearful charge, Hath found it chaff, as these can testify. Lindsey. My liege, we can. Earl of Buchan. There is no evidence. We frankly own him guiltless of this sin. King Robert. Thus we accept him with our penitence.â O Robert! Albany. Sir, I'd have you quite convinced. I'd be impregnable in pardon. Think! Without a motive stronger than herself, Would Nature so unnatural become As spill her proper blood? That so she would Is beyond all belief. In motive lies Sole credit to my having done the deed That seared me in your favour. First my loveâ Which, though the chastisement its care advised, Was turned of God to doom, thereby received No taint or flaw in truthâmy blood-knit love Long-shown is strong 'gainst the ambitious thought That I am charged withal. One royal branch [Enter Prince James and Attendants.] Clipt from the golden tree of monarchy Leaves yet another in his crescent bloomâ King Robert [aside]. He's looking at the boy with eagle eyeâ It is a look of seizure!âO my James, Come to your father's arms! Albany. See where he grows From the old noble trunk. Ambition gives No slightest motive. King Robert. 'Tis enough. You're clear. Albany. That all my love was mocked by the event Is sore to think on. Who can trammel Death With cords obedient to mortal will? My castle hath no dungeon that would hold Th' invisible last foe. For his offence, Which God's great judgment-day alone can strike, I as a man must suffer, while unscathed Goes the arch-murderer of hope and joy. King Robert. It is most true. I'm sorry in my heart That I accused you from an unchecked mouth. Most true! Death oft makes innocence seem guilt. Forgive me, Robert. Albany. Nay, I have no need. 'Twas natural that you should doubt, suspect, Where circumstance so darkly pointed out; And grief 's a headstrong unenlightened guide. I knew that reason, toiling through the mists Of sorrowful opinion and blind wrath, Would show me white and shine on me again Whom passion over-clouded. I am blessed In daylight of your favour. That report That stirs among the commoners, and sinks Into base hearts against me, that I starvedâ King Robert. God's sake, no more! Albany. That villainous, black tale Gains credit from the rumour'd cruelty To England's second Richard. He whom Death With still and sudden handling carries home, Forsooth! upon the people's oath, is starved. King Robert. If you will have acquittal, pardon, grace, Strangle within your throat that awful word, And never freeze the aching man in me With such inhuman, foul suggestion. O God! that ever such a thing hath been Cries shame upon Thy fatherhoodâunless Thou leav'st the punishment of children's sin To devils of the pit. O God! O God! The anguish burns meâshrivels up my soul To whitened ashes and blank lifelessness. Lindsey. The king is moved. Albany. Unhappy that I am, Pleading for pardon, that my tongue should blast Where it would run to heal. I only spoke To shut your doors of hearing from the sound Of false alarum to your tender love; And lo! I wake the sentries of your soul To naked panic. Brother, dearest liege, Have pity on my lips' mistakeâforgive! King Robert. Whereas I feel that none who shares my blood, Or of my mother drank the gentle milk, Could within utmost limits of belief Descend from man to monsterâat this time, Here in this place, I do acquit thy hand Of murder pitiless, thy thought of stain From black, disnatured treason, and thy soulâ Go, take it to the certain eye of God, Not to the tear-dimmed vision of a man, Thine earthly king and brother. Nevermore Speak of this matter,â'tis my earnest pray'r. Albany. So much of pain it brands upon my thought, Silence alone can cicatrize the wound. King Robert. Poor brotherâhere's my hand! Albany. I kiss it, sir. Lo! the remission for our liege to sign, In Latin writ, which clears my innocence And that of Archibald of Douglas, which Hath suffered slur with mine. King Robert. A pen! [signing] You're free.â Oh! with a pen I made him prisoner! Lindsey. What counsel would you take with these your lords? You summoned us to conference, my liege. King Robert. I'd not forgotten. It is near our heart.â Leave us, my James; go to our rooms awhile, Where I can find you presentlyâmy room.â [Exit James. Our words concern our heir and only son. He is a forward scholar and hath learnt All that our northern wisdom can impart, Alas! but little worth, to Scotland's shame. Learning is not less golden in a king Than his own crown; and manners grace him more, As he can more display them in his rank, Than those beneath his sway; we therefore dream Of foreign education for our son In polished France. Albany. [aside]. Sooth to my very aim! My liege, 'tis prudent and well-reasoned. Lindsey. Yes. King Robert. I'm glad it meets your will. The faithful Earl Of Orkney will attend our dearest son With chosen servants. Ere he sail from hence, We would consult your lordships once again. Now we would have our privacy. Albany. We'll go; And ever study to deserve your love. [Exeunt Albany and Lords. King Robert. Oh! it is done! I've set my little boat upon wide seas To save it from the jealous flames aboard That scorch it for destruction. Allan, fetch The Earl of Orkney hither. [Exit Allan.] Kindly knave, Come tell me, I'm a cruel father? Ay? Walter. Oh, not so cruel as the circumstance You'd ward off from your son. King Robert. How? You are dim. I wish men spoke their minds with meaning clear. I'm an old man and my conception slow. Walter. I meant that many dangers threaten him Who is sole heir to sovereigntyâno more. King Robert. That was not it.âGood fellow, do you think That I shall live to see my son return? Walter. O sire, you're hale in body. King Robert. But the heartâ D' you think that it can hold such space of time? Walter. With patience, yes! King Robert. With passionâno! Then there is memory, And all this mourning we must add thereto. [Enter the Earl of Orkney and Allan.] Good earl, 'tis settled that you go with him. Thank Heaven that you live whom I can trust. You will be very watchful; if he die, I am an old and childless man, an end, A mortal Omega, a mere life's term, And ancient monument to Hope's defeat. Earl of Orkney. My liege, I will protect him, watch and love With upright loyalty and perfect care. Allan. Why do you weep so bitterly, my liege? King Robert. O Allan, 'tis a very bitter thought That turns my tears to Marah. O my son! Allan. 'Twill grieve him sore to part with you. King Robert. Of him I was not thinking. He is true and fair, But very young, and he will soon forget. Storms crush the bearded grain; 'twill never rise. The tender sprouting blade is dashed, but springs The better for its grief.âYour arm, kind earl. There's much to settle, many things to do Before you start. We'll walk together, earl. [Exeunt. Allan. We'll to his chamber, Walt, and gladden it With sun and air and cleansing. Walter. 'Tis high time, For like a bat's nest hath it been of late. His absence is our opportunity. [Exeunt. [Re-enter Albany and a Servant.] Albany. Go, fetch the prior. Servant. I will, your grace. Albany. At once. I'll wait him here. I cannot sleep at night; [Exit Servant. Dreams enter when I close my eyes, and stalk Along the silent passages of thought Like ghosts. My health is touched. This must not be. Rest is a precious store I cannot spend On vanities and filmy toys of fear. This prior shall obtain for me from Rome A pardon that will lay my haunting crime With sacred exorcism. Here he comes. [Enter Prior. Hail. Prior. Benedicite! Albany. So would I were, Yet scarcely live I blessed, with dark reports So cast within the mirrors of my soul That she is well-nigh blinded to herself, And takes the dirt that's thrown as native filth And dregs of her impurity. I scarce Believe that I am Albanyâso vile, Corroded, monstrous, full of subtle sin, My enemies declare me. You have heard That Parliament has clarified my fame, The king declared my spotlessness and health. You think I have enough restored my soul? No; there's the holy Church I grieved with guilt Apparent. I would have her pardon, claim Exoneration from the weight of crime Which those who freely hate me still would heap On my bewildered innocence. I ask This right, that she establish me in faith, In guiltlessness, and loyalty. Prior. Your grace, Why need you pardon where there's no offence? Albany. To fortify from slander. Those that brag Against my newly washed, unsullied name, As if it once were black, will lose their tongue When they shall find any untoward speck Of former misconception, error, fault, Which no man, by his nature, can escape, Is cleared by holy Church. Prior. Your grace takes note Too closely of the swarms that sting your name With wounds ephemeral. Such ever fret The ease of reputation. Albany. Pardon me. I suffer from no pricks, but trenchÃ¨d scars. The brand of Cain, the infamous red curse, Is struck across the brow of my repute. Prior. 'Twill blush the more if pardoned. To forgive, Where sin is absent, fills the emptiness With sin's own lurid stain. Albany. Not so, not so. It is a measure of state-policy To silence evil tongues. Prior. To teach them words Of stablished calumny. Albany. There you misjudge. I know men better. Obloquy is dumb Before the vindication of the Church. I'd have you write to Rome this very night, And send a speedy messenger. Prior. Take thought. If, with a soilÃ¨d conscience you would steal The balm that heals confession into peace, Great were your condemnation. Albany. Priest, you tread Too near our honour. Am I not declared By the vox populiâthe voice of Godâ In parliament, and by my peers, unblamed, Unblameable? Prior. You are. Albany. And by the king Acknowledged sinless? Prior. Yes, you are. Albany. What more Desire you? Prior. That your lips should firmly seal The clean page of denial with the stamp And image of your soul. Albany. You ask for much. No Christian dares to say he hath no sin. Prior. Your peers declared you sinless, so you plead. Will you accept the declaration? Albany. No. Prior. The declaration for the special sin That's laid to your account? Albany. You pry too far. Go, write the letter. I disdain to speak The answer to suspicion. Prior. I will write. I know not if His Holiness will grant The pardon you desire. Albany. Nay, urge him to 't, As I am rich and great within the land. Prior. Not so, your grace, as you are innocent; A bribe would but unsettle the belief That you are pure of murder. The clean hand, Unreddened by the stain of blood, as much Detests the golden taint of proffered coin. Dishonoured is the honour that is bought. Albany. You wrong me. I but said that as I'm great, Pre-eminent in riches, which are snares Fate spreads for Envy's watching, it were best I should be fortified with clear renown And holy recognition. By the death Of the king's son, I'm Regentâat the point And pinnacle of influence. A slur Cast on my faith, looses the bond of trust That girdles monarchy;ârank treason spreads Among the scattered members, social craft, Domestic infidelity, the guile Of business, and the tricks of usury. His Holiness will never thus dissolve The unity of State, and strike the Church With such unsanctified and rude assault To manners and religion. Put this down Within the letter, using choicer phrase Selected by your learning. Prior. I will write. God knows I'd have your grace unsullied. Albany. Write This very eve. Prior. I will.âContrition makes Appeal far surer than my feeble pen. Albany. Your pen be strong! To-morrow I'll to shrift. Why do you pause? Prior. Acknowledgment is grace. Albany. Go to!âI'd have you purge disloyalty, Pardon foul lips, detraction infamous. I would forgive my enemies in thus Securing false forgiveness for myself. Mac Louis! [Enter Servant. Show the prior out. Return. [Exit Servant with Prior. This will establish peace within my breast. Oh, may it pacify the corpse of him Who cannot sleep at Lindores! It is said That prodigies make eloquent his tomb, And call for blood to still the murdered soul With slumber of accomplished Nemesis. My blood he asksâmine, or my children's blood. If not my blood, then theirs! Not theirs, not theirs! Child of my brother, O avenging ghost, As thou wert young, ask not my children's blood, And cut not off my seed, though such a doom Were perfect justice! I must wait my time; So must they wait. We know not here nor there, How, when, requital comes; but if besought Thus from the bed of stone where murder lies, Its coming is secure. And yet I think These miracles are old wives' talesâno more. Guilt blurs my understanding. Twice to-day I stumbled,âwhen I named my crime aloud Before the king, and when I offered gold For Church's pardon. Twice the cloud hath swept My brain's clear weather. But here comes a gleam Of goodly sunâthat James is bound for France. It promises the mid-day of my fame, The perfect shining of my dearest hope. I'll sleep on it. [Re-enter Servant.] To-night I'll have strong drinkâ A posset! Bring it to my sleeping-room. [Exeunt. Scene II. âA Chamber. King Robert, Prince James, and the Earl of Orkney. Earl of Orkney. The convoy waits his highness. King Robert. Rather say That dangers wait him; harsh, ambitious seas, And pulseless rocks and unrelenting winds. The elements are homeless, unallied; They have no bonds, no sanctities. I've watched All day the West imbrued with sable storm. I think the breeze is higher. Earl of Orkney. Nay. I'll swear Its freshness hath declined. King Robert. Good! Then we'll wait Till all the air is motionless and safe. Earl of Orkney. Tarry no more, my liege. To slowly part Doth make the rift of parting an abyss. King Robert. O earl, I cannot heave up from my heart Its anchor with Farewell! Earl of Orkney. Yet must you part. King Robert. Not yetânot yet! I cannot loose at once; With soft persistence must the minutes work, Or I shall die. Prince James. Father! King Robert. My only child! Last leaf of my sere bough, when once I loose Thy bond of dear reliance from my side, Untraversable space cuts in between, And I am bare for ever. Earl of Orkney. Come, my liege, You speak as journey never had return, And Providence were nought. King Robert. A keen rebuke! God has a human family, and I Have but one mortal son.âOh, let me look, Gaze at your face and see the future in 't. I shall not watch its changesânever seize The gracious steps whereby your favours mount To manhood's comely top. Your brother's face Was far more delicate, the lips more full And chafing, and the brow less wide and free, With less of gentle space between the eyes As frank as yours. It was a face that drew Much love, except when temper blasted it, Or scorn envenomed. You are sweetly tuned, An even nature; on your forehead dreams, And empire on your mouth. You'll be a man Beneficent and royal. Check those sobs. If I am dead, my spirit will rejoice. Prince James. I cannot leave you. King Robert. Child, nor I loose you. And yet I must, if in the barren world My flesh would still have aught to call its own. Go!ânay, but wait! You'll think of me at night, The games and studies doneâthink how I lie And ponder you. To Memory, as God, The darkness and the light are both alike. Prince James. I'll say âgood-night,â and leave the southern winds To give it to the northern. King Robert. I shall pray, And plunge your name into a well of tears To send it washed to Heaven. Prince James. I will kiss My hand to you ere sleeping. King Robert. And you'll love The rude land of your birth, nor jest at it? Prince James. I've got some heath to carry into France; They say at Paris it is never seen. King Robert. A bushy lock clipt from your country's brow,â Join it with this from my white forehead ta'en. Be faithful to the twisted memories. And, James, there is a head as bright as yours That's laid beneath the ground. Remember it; James, James, remember how your brother died. Prince James. I willâwhen I am king. King Robert. I know thou wilt. The close lips are an oath. Earl of Orkney. My liege, time runs. King Robert. The hour-glass of my very fatherhood Shows all its moments gone. I cannot say The dire word that bereaves me; once I signed A warrant ... Earl, no torture man conceives Could crush this centre down;âGod has a rack Whereon He breaks some hearts.âI keep you, earl. My child, One mighty speechless clasp! Thus, thus, begot, Thus lost for ever to my arms' embrace. ... Now falls the strokeânow, now! Prince James. I'll run away. King Robert. Settle thy chin nor weep. All's over now. James, send me all the verses that you write; Your masters' names and how you spend each day; And who is kind and if the land is fair. [Exit Prince James, hiding his face. He's gone! Good earl, go after! Shut the door. [Exit the Earl of Orkney. Starved, starved! Starvation! David, David! Son! It's in my heart the hunger and the want, And from the lenten depths of my own soul I pity thee. Andâoh!âto think of it! His vivid youth and golden beauty gone To the unloved Obscure, the comfortless Environment of Night. I know they think That I forget him; for his memory That like a grave-stone stood against my heart Hath sunk into its substance, and now seems To careless eyes half lost; but so much more 'Tis hidden in my love's dark sepulchre. He gave his lusty years to wantonness And shameful riot. All my being's hope I'd give for his deliverance. And yet I did not train him with strict uprightness; I gave my precepts with a fearful voice, O'erlook'd his irreligion, made excuse For spotted innocence and growing guilt. He died in soul. My brother married him With gross dishonourâso he died in heart. I left his punishment in other hands; And then he died in body; triple death, Three-fold starvation! I am judged. Ah me! And yet I send my sole surviving child To a licentious court, that I may shun His arduous protection. God is just. I who have loosed all duties from my neck, Shall sometime feel the stone of Sisyphus Rolled on to me for carriage. YetâO God!â The stranger's care alone could save my child. [Exit. Scene III. âThe same. A Hall. Enter Albany. Albany. My son and grandsons in a vision bowed Their heads before me, and my phantom-hand Let fall the hungry steel upon their necks. My sin, my sin was executioner, For I myself was dead as midnight ghost.â All this is fever; yet within the lines Of sane and irreproachable surmise My fear attains to danger; for my son Is feeble, indolent,âa man of peace, Unworthy of my loins; he'll lose my gain, Drop what I've damned my soul to lay on him. Then is there James. ... Would he might share His brother's grave! A like captivity Shall wither himâ [Enter an Attendant.] Attendant. Your grace, Sir John is dead. Albany. Ramorgny? He hath lived A white and staring life these many days. How ended it? Attendant. He hung against the wall Within a dusty corner. Albany. Self-undone. 'Twas melancholia!âAttend my charge Go: bear this letter to the English king.â Here is a purse.âRest not, until you lay Its sealÃ¨d sheet within his royal hand. Attendant. My bounteous lord, this opportunity To do you serviceâ Albany. Speak not; but begone. [Exit Attendant. O Opportunity!â My soul, self-murdered, rots beneath the stake That pointed her direction. Now again She glimmers on the crooked, deep-cut way Of treachery, and I will follow her. She is the fleeting guide that draws my life Through all its paths of darkness; she's the star That leads ambition forth! My letter greets The King of England, tells him how the seas Are bringing James to France, sets down the points Where he will touch on English ground, and when. The lure will take; my last impediment Find, like my first, a prison. I am blessed. Would that the pardon came, and that I felt Less sick at banquets, and saw less of dreams. [Exit. Scene IV. âThe Castle of Rothsay in Bute. A Chamber. King Robert, the Duchess Marjorie, Allan. Duchess Marjorie. Now that my infamous, false bond is loosed, And death has cleared my wrong, with sweetened thought I tend and love my monarch's broken age. My pride no longer fills my care with gall As when his son was living.âLet me put Your cushion smooth and easy for the head.â Good Allan, help me. Allan. Blankâno gratitude. His agÃ¨d sight is travelling across The limit whence his life will follow it. He listens to our human speech no more Than if his ears were closed. He cannot last More than to learn his son is safe in France. King Robert. Ha! France! Allan. Yes, sireâPrince James is surely safe. The wind hath favour'd sailing. Duchess Marjorie. Let me raise Your feet, my father, on this other stool. Allan. He's gone again. Duchess Marjorie. A lost, a feeble face That makes no terms with Death. Allan. Lady, I'm glad That I have had no children. It is sore To lose themâsee them die like upward sparks, And your own embers burning still to ash. Duchess Marjorie. Yesâand to see them sin and sell their souls To vanity. I'll never give the world More lives to waste. Allan. An' yet to have no love! I loved your husband; I had been forlorn Without his kindly laugh. Duchess Marjorie. Enough! He died In time to save his kindness from all taint, But nothing else. King Robert. Look! Does the weather-cock Still point to south? Allan. Yes, and the day is fair And full of shining. King Robert. Help me to look out. Duchess Marjorie. You are too weak to move. King Robert. I must look out. Support me to the window.âOver there Is France, the sunny land, beyond those fields Of wheaten green, beyond, beyond, beyond! And where's the east? Allan. 'Tis yonder. King Robert. Over there Is dark Lindores, beyond the blasted moors That make the distance mournâbeyond, beyond! Both unattainable! O heart, too far!â Now I'll sit down.âWhy runs that man so fast? Allan. Perchance he brings us happy tidings, sire, That the young prince is well. King Robert [struggling to speak]. My tongue hath swooned At presage of his tidings. HasteâO stayâ Not more ... I should be stronger tasting death To bear it. ... Allan. Nay, 'tis surely happy news. Our gallant prince in health and full of joy. Look! they are come. What ho! Prince James is safe! [Enter the Earl of Buchan and Walter.] Earl of Buchan. He's in an English prisonâin the Tow'r That frowns upon the Thames. King Henry hath, Against the laws of knighthood, seized the ship That bore our prince, and vows he'll teach the tongue Of France to Scotland's heir. King Robert. He's dead. Walter. No, no: In prison, and a kindly one they say. King Robert. He's deadâhe's dead! They told me such false tales; David was but in prison, in kind wallsâ And he was dead. I'm near the grave for lies To much avail you. Earl of Buchan. No; he is not dead. He's well and treated in most gracious ways. King Robert. Starved? Earl of Buchan. He is well attended and well kept, Even from the royal board. King Robert. Away, begone! I'm dying, and you thrust the earth on me. I'm on my way to judgment. Let me face No witnesses;âno bleeding chiefs that slew Each other, I consenting; no poor souls I've left to evil men; no innocents Condemned by wicked judges I have feared To thwart; no beggars, stripped by greedy lords Whose avarice I bore; no murdered forms Whose murd'rers I forgave. No need of such. I plead that I am guilty.âBring them not. I'm guilty on my solemn oath, O God. Father of men, King of the universe, I've sinned in Thy great officesâin both! Bring not Thy witnessesâmy people's ghosts. Bring not that dear dread witness, with pale hands And different keen face and eyes, whose look Would fix a root of horror in my soul To grow up like a yew-tree from a grave. Let me be judged within an empty court! Or, if we're judged together,âwhen the book Is opened, where in lines of red are writ The sins of his few years,â And he stands far apart in white despair, Then shall he answer to a few that fall From the accusing lips, but point the sum To me for answer. I will take them all As blessings:âfor a father's sins extend Far over his own blotted page; yea, fill With scarlet of damnation many blanks His children had left clean except for him. Allan. How solemn is this judgment before death, Enacted for our profit. Walter. Thus to see A soul in flesh corruptible appear Before th' immortal bar. King Robert. My God, my God! I wait Thy sentence; I am self-contemned, Without a word from any human voice. It will not be to flames! Some writers say The punishments of hell are nothing more Than change of statesâeach man his opposite. If so, then I shall be a childless slave, My fatherhood and royalty displaced, Seen in some other, who within my sight Leans his one hand upon a goodly son, The other on a sceptre. Then, oh then, The penal fires would be like Heaven's glow, Their smoke refreshing cloud and covering From the heart-scorching sight. Allan. Will none approach To hold him up? Duchess Marjorie. I will.âHis eyes are wild With something in the depths. King Robert. Lost! lost! 'Tis done. There is no crown upon my head. Oh say, Is nothing on my head? Duchess Marjorie. A little round Of sovereign gold. King Robert. But I can feel there's naught; And in me all my father's love is sucked Forth by the cruel wind.âWhat face is that? I never knew it. Yet the hairâthe hair! But oh! the eyesâI've never looked on such, Nor known those lips. If it should be my son, I do disown him, disinherit, curse! Now Hell receive me! Duchess Marjorie. See, the change hath come, Death's ashen tread, before it stoops to take. Allan. Gather about him now the strife is done. Peace presses us together. King Robert [in a whisper]. Prison! Death! The cloud of night is rising in mine eyes; I feel Life turn the key upon my heart. There is no op'ning.âIt is darkâI die. [Dies. Duchess Marjorie. That was the last heave of the broken heart, The last breath of the soul. Allan. My king, my lord! I never thought thy death would be so strange, With all that pain to end a gentle life. [Enter Albany.] Duchess Marjorie. Your grace, the king is dead. Albany. How!âdead!âthe king! Duchess Marjorie. He died upon the news that James is ta'en The King of England's captive. Earl of Buchan. Now your grace Is Regent, till the prisoner is loosed, Whose chains bind down our restive fealty And tie it to your will. Albany. A trust I hold But for the regal future. Lift the head! Died he at peace? Walter. Oh no, he mourn'd his son Till we could hear no more. Albany. Alas! and this Is rule and monarchyâto be like this, Poor, old, unhappy, ignorant, extinct.â [Aside.] For this I've doom'd my soul. What's done is done. I'll use my fortune till I'm even thus.â He had few sins to dread. Duchess Marjorie. And yet he died Most full of hellish terrors. Albany. I will send A great procession. John, I mourn thy fate. False was the comfort that new-nam'd thy state. [Exit. Duchess Marjorie. I'll to a convent's refuge, there to pray For his affrighted soul, and sooth to say For his sake will I join another name To his and never think they're not the same. [Exit. Allan. His heart was broken, not by strokes of Time, But thrusts of him who should have propp'd it. Crime Such as dark Albany's is visited On the third generation. Raise the dead. [Enter procession of Churchmen and Lords.] His doom was in his gentleness and fear. His changÃ¨d name still brought him to this bier. [Exeunt omnes.</field>
