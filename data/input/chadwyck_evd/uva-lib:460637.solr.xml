      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Drachenfels. [The sun is setting. Hunters on the rocksâFishermen on the riverâPeasants in the valleyâall returning home. Faustus seated on a rock, with a large volume in his hand. At the end of the Chorus, the sun has set. CHORUS OF FISHERMEN on the water. Home! there's a storm in the whistling blast; Home! the sun is sinking fast! Home! Home! CHORUS OF HUNTERS on the mountains. The wild bird is rocking in his nest; Sinks on the moss the deer to rest. Home! Home! CHORUS OF PEASANTS in the valley. Now for the fire-side's cheerful blaze, Songs of mirth, and tales of fays. Home! Home! [Exeunt. Faus. At length I've found the charm, sought for long years With fruitless toil,âyet now it came i' the instant,â Like the swift lightningâhere too, in the book Whence man drinks life eternal. Is't not strange? Yet no; not strange; 'tis from its wholesome food The serpent draws its poison. I've the charm Which, but to think of, calls the devil from hell, And, utter'd, shivers earth itself to atoms. I may have riches, more than wit can number; I may have power, more than kings can compass; I may have beauty, more than ever sate At Jove's own board and crown'd immortal pleasures; I may have this, and more than this,âaye, more Than sober sense e'er dreamt ofâand I will. Voice (below). Wilt thou, indeed? Hast thou the courage, Faustus? Faus. Who ask'd that question? Have I, then, two souls In mutual strife? Or is't some spirit without That whispers me? I know not, and I care not. Spirit of darkness, I invoke thee not With blood or fire; I entreat thee not With sacrifice; I call thee as thy masterâ By that word which may be thought, not utter'd; That word, which, stronger than the winds or thunder, Hurl'd thee from heaven, which, but to think of, Turns my best blood to iceâby that! by that I do command thee, fiend,âappear! appear! Chorus from below the earth. We hear! we hear! we hear! Faus. The spell, then, is all potent to its end; It was no vain imagining. Again I speak it in my heart, though not in word; I do command thee, fiendâappear! appear! Chorus from below the earth. He comes! he comes! he comes! Faus. Then let him come, the sooner still the better. I'm wild with hope, with terror, withâI know notâ But come, appear I say; appear! appear! [Wild music. The Demon appears in clouds and fire. Ah! thou art terrible, and I am nothingâ Yet no; can I do this, I can do more. Put off that form! I charge thee by the spell That brought thee hither. Take on thee a shape, Which I may look upon, and not as now Stand shudd'ring at thy nearness. By that spell! [Music. The Demon disappears. What! Does he mock me? Ruin, then, take all! I'll speak it, though to speak it is to perish. [Wilder Music. Faustus raises his hand to heaven, and seems about to speak, when Mephistophiles suddenly appears at his side, and pulling down his arm, takes the book from him. Meph. Pray fling aside that book. [Flinging it into the water. Faus. And who art thou? Meph. E'en he you call'd for, and so lustily. Faus. (Half aside.) This is not he I fashion'd in my thoughts. Meph. That's like enough: I wear as many shapes As men have fancies. Faith! there was a time I wore a tail and horns; but that's long past. Your maidens give me wings, and clepe me Cupid; Your misers paint me blind, and call me Plutus; Your soldiers, with a big mouth, call me Honor; Your poets call me Fame; your gluttons any thing That may be eaten; and your gamesters, they Call me so many names I scarce can count them; But maiden, miser, poet, glutton, gamester, Are all the time but following the devil. Faus. Is't real, then? Is he so close beside me? The fiend himself? Meph. Nothing so strange in that: The devil's at most men's elbows, though, indeed, He wisely keeps incog, that they may still Go on the good old wayâexcept, indeed, To some choice spirits like yourself, who will Insist upon his presence. Faus. If 'tis true,â And yet I doubtâand yet it is too palpable. I will be satisfied. By that dread spellâ Meph. Pray you spare that; it needs not 'twixt such friends; I'll give you all you've wit enough to ask. Faus. Without condition? Meph. What, you've not outgrown The nurs'ry yet? You think the devil must needs Have wax and parchment surety? Tut, he wants No bond from men or women but their actions. Faus. Thou art my slave! Meph. Aye, for the present. Faus. Dream I?â And if I dream not, bear me hence! Meph. But whither? Faus. To any place; for any change convinces. Yet stay; there was a maidâ Meph. And now no maid, Nor wife, nor widow. Faus. Dost scoff me, fiend, If that, indeed, thou be'st the fiend? Meph. Not I. Faus. Bear me to Veniceâto Adine. Meph. Bravo! 'Tis the high flood of carnival. I'faith! We shall have sport, brave sport; your hand; hold fast. Pass earth; pass sky; Time stand; space fly; Till before us Venice lie. Music. The Scene suddenly changes to SCENE II. [The preceding Scene is suddenly involved in wreck, and as the last cloud vanishes, Faustus and Mephistophiles are discovered in the place of St. Marc, in Venice, Faustus still holding by the demon, but sunk into a state of stupefaction. The scene is decorated with all the preparatory splendour and gaiety of the approaching carnival. Day is dawning; and as the strain of wild and fearful music (to which the change has taken place), ceases, the Demon speaks. Meph. Rouse thee, Faustus; thou'rt in Venice; look up! Thy command, scarce uttered, is obey'd. Own, now, the devil's a man of his word. Faus. 'Tis real; I do not dream. The powers, who control our mortal earth, I do command. Where is Adine? Meph. Pshaw! Pshaw! the old song still. Why, Venice has a thousand beauties; aye, And ready, too, as fair; which, as I take it, Is not a little virtue in the dear ones; It saves hypocrisy. Why should Adine, Then, be remembered? Faus. I would tell thee, fiend Hadst thou a soul behind that iron mask To comprehend my meaning; ah, she fell Confiding in my love, as the young flowrets Unfold their blossoms to the summer sun, And wither in its fierceness. Poor Adine! Meph. Oh, that sounds well; and, long as words sound well, There's not a creature would be ass enough To ask their meaning, save, indeed, an ass. Faus. Wilt bring me to the maid? Meph. She'll soon be here, And spare my bringing, with a troop of friends As simple as herself; a young maid, too, One Rosolia. Had I but a grain Of this same poetry, you'd hear such wonders; Oh, I should blossom out in simile And trope and metaphor, all flower and moonshine. The truth is, I'm too honest for a poet, I cannot lie enough; yet not to boast, I am a good hand that way, too. Faus. They come! Make us to mortal sight invisible. Meph. Yon wall will do the feat without my magic. Come, step aside, I'll answer for the wall. [Exeunt. Enter Count de Casanova, Rosolio, Adine, and Orsini. Casa. Come along, girls; this way; here's the very centre of the mirth; here crowd all the choice masquers. By the feathered heels of Mercury, but their gambols make my old blood tingle again. Hey, Rosolia? Ros. Faith, father, I could wish my gentle cousin, Adine, here, were merrier. Casa. Pooh, pooh! some sentimental nonsense. What, has the handsome young doctor of Wittenberg made an incurable puncture in your little heart? Adine. You are merry, sir: Iâ Casa. Merryâto be sure I am. I never was otherwise. I was merry in my cradleâmerry when I was a bachelorâmerry when I married, and merry now I'm a widower. I've nothing left to plague me but a saucy daughter, who does nothing but laugh at me, and talk me to death. Ros. Nay, sir, you're my match, or any body's else at talking. Casa. Well, and why shouldn't I talk? I've nothing to think of. Ros. A good reason, certainly; but I wish you'd cast poor Signor Orsini's nativity, father, and see if there be any hope for him with Adine, for a more rueful picture of sighing constancy was never seen. Casa. (to Orsini) Tut, tut, man; never mind the Wittenberg doctorâdoctorâwhat's his name, Adine? Ors. I see too plainly, Count, I have nothing to hope or fear. Casa. To herâto her, man. If Apollo be lord of the ascendant to-day in the house of Venus, Fortune may shew Mars in ascendancy to-morrow; therefore, to her, soldier! hey, Rosolia, am I not right? Ros. Indeed, sir, I think you might set example yet to younger lovers. Casa. I think soâI think soâif the pretty Lucetta, the innkeeper's daughter, but listen to me kindly. (aside. Ors. Your pardon, dearest lady, but if e'er My suit could hope to thrive, it must be now When all around is gaietyâI've been Too oft denied; but 'twas in sadder hours. Adine. Alas! I have no hours that are not sad. Ors. But not now, lady, but not nowâand I May tell my love, and hope a kinder answer. Is it not so? Adine. I pray you, sir, forbear: I have no heart for love, for any thing But forâ(aside) be stillâbe stillâOh Faustus! Faustus! QUARTETTE. Casanova, Adine, Rosolia, and Orsini. Adine. Go, seek some virgin heart, Which sorrow never knew, Such may the love impart Which to thy worth is due. Sorrows I dare not name My heart unseen consume, Like the undying flame That lights a tomb. Ors. Must, then, my heart its hopes forego, And no return my passion know? Casa. Prithee let her alone: When sought as a favour, From Venus, I own, Not a kiss would have savour. Sighs and tears I regard as a joke; The heart, that I prize, Must leap thro' the eyes, Ere a word by the lips can be spoke. Ors. Ah! do all my hopes deceive me! Ros. (To Orsini.) Poor heart retire! [illeg.] With hopes she'll e'er receive thee. Adine. Go, seek some virgin heart May love for love impart; In pity hence, thy suit give o'er, And mention love to me no more. All. In pity hence, thy suit give o'er, And/I'll mention love to me/her no more. [Exit Orsini. [The rest retire. [The music gradually encreases to a lively measure, to which the various characters of the carnival enter, until the stage is filled, and a kind of ballet representation of the shows and gaieties of the festival takes place. Enter Faustus and Mephistophiles, behind. Faus. Who is yon lady with Adine? Meph. Rosolia, her cousinâa sprightly maiden. Faus. And beautiful.âHer eye darts fires might warm The icy bosom of a fasting anchorite, And teach him passion.âIs that her father? Meph. It is!â Faus. Beautiful Rosolia!â Meph. The beautiful Adine is weeping on her breast. Faus. Mock onâmock onâmock what thou hast not heart Nor brain to comprehend, with all thy power. Meph. The heart and brainâtwo fine companions those! 'Tis hard to say which plays the fool most wisely. Faus. She is indeed most beautifulâthat smile So soft and winning, and those eyes all fire! But noâanother time for her;âand now I'd be with my Adineâalone. Obey me. Meph. Obey thee? to be sureâWhy not obey thee? In serving such a friend I serve myself. [Goes to Adine. He's hereâI mean the doctor, he who met A certain lady in a certain grove By moonlightâ Adine. (rushing forward) What voice was that? [Music. At this instant another figure, resembling Adine, assumes her place, and is led off by Casanova and Rosolia. Mephistophiles, receding, points to her, and exit. [The Scene suddenly changes at the same moment to a lonely place. Adine stands motionless. Faus. (approaching gently) Adine! my Adine! [Adine turns fearfully, and, recognizing him, shrieks, and rushes into his arms. Adine. Faustus! Oh, why hast thou deserted me? Faus. I have not deserted theeâ Adine. And art thou come to make me thine for ever? I have not known one happy hour since I quitted youâand then your long long silence: My heart was almost broken. Faus. I'll heal it, dearest. I'm here to recompence thy gentle faith With boundless power. Adine. Boundless power!âWhat mean you? Faus. Look roundâBehold a proofâ Adine. (looking round) Gracious heaven, where am I? What place is this?â How came I hereâOh Faustus! dear Faustus! Faus. Thou art in safety from surprise and dangerâ With thy Faustus and alone!âWhat is't you fear?â Adine. Men report strange things of thee. Faus. And grant them trueâwill Adine cease to love? Adine. Oh! no, noâbut if this be trueâ If thou art leagued with powers I dare not name, Tho' I must still dearly dearly love thee, And tho' to part with thee were certain death, Yet part with thee I wouldâ Faus. And would'st thou, girl, because by ceaseless toil, In deep and midnight studies, I have won Dominion o'er the powers of darknessâ Would't thou, for this, abandon me; Me, me to whom thou'st sworn eternal love? Adine. E'en so!âand die! still loving thee. Faus. (calmly) Then we must partâfor this is so, Adine! AIR.âAdine. The hour is come that we must part, And cold is thy farewell, While thou, within this lonely heart, Must ever dearer dwell. Within the cloister's holy cell My shame I must recall; There oft must burning memory tell Thy triumph, and my fall. And there I'll pour the ceaseless tear Of penitence for sin; And strive, by one incessant prayer, Thy soul's release to win. Farewellâmy heart's worst pang is past; It err'd for thee alone; And, oh! until it breathe its last, That heart is all thine own. Faus. Hear meâ I cannot, if I would, resign the knowledge I have obtained. There is no Lethe To cleanse and purify a mind Once so endow'd as mine. Adine. Oh! say not so, dear Faustus! Faus. If wealth or love of sway can tempt thee, Pronounce the word, and at thy regal foot The thousand thrones of gorgeous Ind shall pour Their treasures down, and own their vassalage. Adine. I want no treasures but thy loveâno throne But thy heartâOh let me win it back to heaven. Faus. Give me thy hand, Adineâere Time can wave His silent pinions o'er a moment's space We'll fly to regions of perpetual summer. Lo! e'en now I'll call the spirit! [A strain of low music. Adine. No! noâlet go my hand. There is no consent In my most hidden heart to such dread evil; And over me the fiend shall not prevail. [Mephistophiles suddenly starts up behind Adineâshe shudders. Adine. What suffocating fearful heat is this Comes creeping o'er my brain, like the fell blast Which haunts the desert?â Faus. Now, slave! spread thy broad pennons for our flight! Adine. No!âhere I cry for aid by this dread spell That withers up the tempter's power to nothing, Oh! free me from his presence! help, heaven! [She lifts up the cross of her rosary, and Mephistophiles, shuddering, suddenly vanishes.â Faustus trembles, hides his face, and recedes from the stage.âAdine utters a slight convulsive shriek, as if conscious of relief from their presence, and falls senseless. SCENE III. Exterior of an Inn. Montolio, Antonio, and Wagner, enter from the Inn. Wag. Here we may breathe; sub dio;âbut more wine, Mi domineâyour hot-house is not hotter Than that same camera, I think you call it. Wheugh! had I been a melon, I had blossom'd, And fructified, and ripen'd, in an hour. Mont. Well, but your tale; you spoke just now of Faustus. Wag. You're wrong; I was about to speak; dicturus. Mont. Psha! 'tis all one, man. Wag. MinimÃ¨; the things Are most diverse; I'll prove it logicÃ¨. Mon. We'll grant it without proof: Wag. You're wrong again. [Enrico sings without. Mon. Why, sure it is Enrico! Ant. You are right, If I may trust my eyes. Wag. No, sir, you may not; Eyes are fallacious; seeing is no proof. But who's Enrico? quÃ¦so, now, I pray you. Mon. A gallant soldier, and my worthy friend. He comes fresh from the wars, where he has earned An honourable name. (Enrico enters) Right welcome home. Ant. Welcome again to Venice. Mon. Doubly welcome. En. I thank you, gentlemen. Mon. A friend of ours; A student fromâhow do you call the place? Your German names defy Venetian lips. Wag. From Wittenberg, where, as the poet sings,â Mon. Well, never mind the poet. (To Enrico) Come, you'll join us? En. I've not yet seen my sister. Mon. Nay, a glass; Old friends must not so lightly part, Enrico. En. Sirs, you shall rule me. Right good wine, i' faith. Mon. And now of Faustus. Wag. Aye, he is a man! My master, too;âbut understand me, sirs, I' the way of learning; I was his famulus; 'Till I bethought me it was fit a scholar Should see the world. Mon. But if report speak truth, Your Faustus has had dealings with the devil. Wag. He scorns the devil, has learning in his head Enough for twenty colleges; and yet He has his humours. He can draw a sword, And love a pretty wench, too, I can tell you. En. Good learning in a doctor! Wag. I remember, There was a short time since at Wittenberg A Venice maid, a handsome girl enough, Adine di Campo Fiore. En. What of her? Wag. She and the doctorâeh! you understand! En. You do not mean to sayâ Wag. I mean to say, The lady, as your Frenchman sweetly phrases it, Made a slight faux-pas with the doctor. En. (striking him) Liar! Draw, villain! Wag. Draw! you've almost drawn my teeth. What should I draw? I've nothing, sir, to draw. Mon. Come, come; here's some mistake. En. My sister! Wag. Eh! His sister! Incidi in Scyllam! Hold him. Cohibe iram!âthat is, be pacified. Let us proceed to argumentum. En. Off! He is no friend to me that holds me back, Wag. Yes, but he is to me. Pray, hold him fast; And let us argue this affair scholasticÃ¨. It was not I faux-pas'd it with your sister. En. Shall I hear this? Wag. Upon my life it was not. If you must fight, the doctor is your man; And, as I heard a half-hour since, he's here. En. Is this true, sirs? Mon. Indeed, I've heard as much. En. Then let me go; I will not harm the fool; He is not worth my anger; but for Faustus, Or he or I. [Exit Enrico. Wag. Vade in pacem! Mon. Sir! You must not be so free of speech, unless Your hand is prompter to your sword. Wag. Quite wrong; Fighting's his trade, as argument is mine. Oh, an I had him now at Wittenberg, You'd see how I would handle him; mehercule! I'll run him clean through with a syllogism; Pound him to dust with Aristotle's elenches; Or snare him with the argument Socraticum. Mon. Go to; you are a coward. Wag. Probes; prove it. Ant. Away; he is not for our company. [Exeunt Montolio and Antonio. Wag. What, gone without probation! Brutes, per Jovem; I'll in and syllogize the landlord's daughter; She is a fair one, and eke loves a scholar. SONG. I'm a young German scholar, and think the best college, Where a man may acquire the very best knowledge, Is a pretty girl's heart;âwhere admitted,âat ease, You arrive at the honours, and take your degrees. Don't you think so?âI do!â Oh yes! Gentlemen, Nine out of ten, Will admit what I say to be true. As a trencher-capp'd Fellowâan A. B. or A. M. To rise in a college,âI'd scorn and contemn, If, as Fellow in love,âI may rise by my parts, To be chosen Lucetta's first Master of Hearts. Don't you, &amp;c. &amp;c. As for magic,âthe spell where the true power lies All the spirits to charm, may be read in her eyes; And no conjuror's circle, to shield us from harms, Can compare with that form'd by a pretty girl's arms. Don't you, &amp;c. &amp;c. Then away with all musty old learning at once, Books and devils for love I'll for ever renounce; Hebrew, Latin, and Greek all aside may be flung, For the tongue of all tongues is a pretty girl's tongue. Don't you, &amp;c. &amp;c. [Exit. SCENE IV. A Room in the Inn. Lucetta, the Innkeeper's Daughter enters. Luc. What does Master Wagner mean by leaving me so long alone! He knows my father has gone out for the day, and here have I been waiting and wishing and watching in my own room; really, if it be his books that keep him from me, I wish he'd be a little more of the lover, and less of the scholar; and yet he does talk so learnedlyâthough I don't understand what he says, very oftenâdear young man! but he has taught me a great deal already, and has promised, after we are married, to teach me a great deal more. (Tap at the window.)âThere he is. Count de Casanova speaks without. Casa. Hist! hist! Lucettaâmy pretty Lucetta! 'tis I. Luc. 'Tis that disagreeable old count. An old rogue, with his ape's face and shambling legsâchattering and lying, faster than any barber, about his stars and planets. Casa. (Looking in at window) Lucetta, my pretty twinkler, let me in. (She opens the door, and the Count enters.) Here I am, flown on the wings of Cupid; the urchin has lent me his bow and arrow, to shoot my little Lucetta through the heart. Luc. Cupid with bow and arrow! more like Time with scythe and hour-glass. Casa. You are a rogue; Time has nothing to do with me. All the Casanovas died young at a century, and I'm not much past the half-way yetâa very youth. So my little Venus must not prove retrograde. Luc. No more retrograde than yourself. What do you mean, sir! Casa. Retrograde, my little luminary, is adverseâ backward. Luc. Then 'tis a shame to abuse me so, for Mr. Wagner says I'm a very forward little girl. Casa. Oh! and who is Mr. Wagner? Luc. A very handsome merry young student from Germany. Casa. Oh, ho!âa hostile ascendant in the house of Venus. I must take a new observation. Hereâhere's a golden language, that every one can understand; translate it, (gives it into her hand) and take pity upon me. Luc. Really, now, I don't think you look quite so old or ugly as you did. Casa. Gold clears the sight amazingly. Here's anotherâ(holds out another purse)âa twin brother of the former: perhaps now you'll see clearer still. Luc. I declare now you are quite beautifulâa very Adonis. Casa. Adonisâpooh! a tame pigeonânot worth his peas; he turned tail to his Venus, while I face mine. Oh, Lucetta! look in my face, and read my passion. Luc. I can't, tis written in such a queer language. I wish Wagner was here. Casa. Curse Wagner! I love you. (Kneels.) Be kind, and raise my hopes. [Wagner sings without. Luc. There's some one coming; quickâquickâ get up. Casa. (Gets on one knee, and strives to rise from the other.) Fast, by Jupiter! Confound this lumbago! One knee came up kindly enough; but the other sticks as fast to the floor as steel to the loadstone. TRIO. Casa. Now prithee your laughing give o'er; If I'm caught, zounds, my character's gone. Luc. There's some one is close at the door; Quick, quick, prithee rise, sir, and run. [During this, Lucetta goes to the doorâWagner entersâshe points to Casanova, and seems to explain, shewing purse, &amp;c. They advance, Wagner unseen by Casanova. Luc. (On one side Casanova.) Come, I'll pity my lover, And give him some ease; Casa. Ay, do, help me up that I may go. Wag. (On the other side of him.) When elderly gentlemen go on their knees, They should mind they have not the lumbago. Luc., Wag. When elderly gentlemen go on their knees, They should mind they have not the lumbago. Casa. Stand out of the way, No longer I'll stay; Of my gold I am cheated; My hopes are defeated; You hussey, you rogue, How dare you collogue? My revenge you shall both of you feel. Luc. Your hopes, sir, I spurn; Your gold I return; I'm not to be sold For jewels or gold. Wag. To the wither'd and old So prithee away; And all I've to say Is, the next time you need Your passion to plead, Remember, old boy, not to kneel. Casa. (With the others.) Curse the gold!âaway, away; Here I/he will no longer stay; Laugh'd atâcheatedâ Mock'dâdefeatedâ Rage, confusion, shame I/you feel. [Omnes repeat this last stanza, as Casanova exits in a rage. Luc. Thank the stars, the old ass is gone. Wag. And has left his aurumâhis gold. Luc. An impertinent old fool! It shall be returned to him. Wag. By no means; keep it as thy dowry, my formosa puella, when we nuptiallize. Luc. When weâwhat, Mr. Wagner? Wag. Marry; wilt thou have me for better or worse? Luc. I scarcely know; I have seen too little of you yet to decide;âwhat are you truly? Wag. What am I trulyâhomo. Luc. Homo! and what's that? Wag. A noun substantive, and means a man; can you decline me? Luc. Are you rich? Wag. Paululum pecuniÃ¦ânot very; but doctus âlearned. Luc. We can't live upon learning, though I confess I do love it. Wag. And love and learning together can do wonders: therefore, let us strike hands, and every thing I know I will teach thee. Luc. Well, propose it to my father. Wag. Moxâpresently; where is he? Luc. In his own parlour. Wag. Who's with him? Luc. Only Signor Tuccarello, a would-be lover of mine, whom I hate; he's such a fierce-looking, ugly fellow. Wag. Not like me, eh? Luc. Not a bit; he looks as if he'd eat anybody up that dares but look at me; but don't you mind him; my father does not like him at all. Wag. But he does me, I know; and so here goes. If my foreign scholarship should fail with him, you shall plead with me; you have the true eloquence of persuasion, you little gipsyâthe language of the eyes, that's understood all over the world; and a pretty girl, with a pair of speaking sparklers in her head, is a perfect polyglote. [Exit. Luc. Well, he's a nice young man; he won my heart when he came under my window by day-break and saidâ SONG. Lucy dear! Lucy dear! wake to the spring; Hark! how the village bells merrily ring; Joy's on the earth, in the sky, on the sea; Lucy dear! Lucy dear! come down to me. All have gone forth to welcome the day, Lads with their tabors, and maids crown'd with May; Who'll be the queen? and who'll be the king? Lucy dear! Lucy dear! wake to the spring. Bees, humming, gaily sip the bright dew; All now is waiting, dear Lucy, for you; Joy's on the earth, in the sky, on the sea; Lucy dear! Lucy! then come down to me. [Exit. SCENE V. Exterior of the Count di Casanova's Mansion. Enter Faustus, Mephistophiles, and Two Serenaders. Meph. This is your turtle's nest. Faus. My sweet Rosolia! Meph. Sweet Adine! Faus. How dar'st thou name that name? Meph. I do but sing a good old song of yours. Faus. Speak it again, we separate that instant. Meph. That were a pity. But now for the lady. Faus. I'll have her love, and you must find the means. Meph. Nothing more easy; our friends here shall chaunt An am'rous stave or two; she opes the casement; You send a score of lies up to her beauty. Compare her to the sun, the moon, the stars; Sigh, laugh, kneel, rage, protest, deny, Swear you will shoot, or drown, or hang yourselfâ You need not do it though, 'twould spoil the farceâ And so the thing is done. Faus. Why, thou dull fiend, Can all thy subtlety advise no better? Meph. What would you have? Faus. Rosolia! Meph. And shall, Give me but time enough. Faus. With time myself Would win her, and not need the devil's help. But no; fill her young heart with instant love; Let me be as Apollo in her eyes, My voice as musicalâmy form as fair; Make me the only image of her thoughts, The everlasting shadow of her dreams; My presence be her joy, her light, her life; And in my absence let her love and weep, As flowers weep, and droop their golden heads, When the bright sun has left them. Meph. Here's a strain! For his sake, friend, who shall be nameless, pray you, No more of it. Come, gentlemen, your tools, Your hurdy-gurdies, quick; and dole me out An invocation to the lady's beauty; No matter for the sense; the rhymeâthe rhyme Shall bear you out. SERENADE. The world is gay, the moon is bright, But oh, there are sweeter hours in night, Believe me, love; believe me! When the light falls down in pearly showers, And trembles o'er rills and the sleeping flowers, And softlyâso softly steal the hours, Night like a dream would leave thee. Sweet, then, on the moonlit bank to lie, For love then burns in the heart and eye, With no day-cares to grieve thee; Sweet, then, to murmur the words of bliss, While lip meets lip in a breathless kiss; Earth may have joys, but heaven's in this; Believe me, love; believe me. Enrico enters. En. Villains! have I found you? Meph. Why, are we villains, Faustus? En. Faustus? oh! I thank thee, heaven. Now, then, draw or die! Meph. You'll find us ready; we can win the wife, And after cut the cuckold-husband's throat. What! we are perfect cavaliers! Faus. Stand by; This quarrel's mine! Enrico and Faustus fight. The Serenaders run off. Meph. A noble thrust in carte! ParryâSeconde! an excellent reverseâ Riposte! a shrewd lunge, faith! Sa, sa, sa, sa! Carte over armânow tierceâand now, my boy, Hai!âyou have it! (Enrico falls) Bravo, my noble Faustus! Faus. I ne'er shed blood till now. Meph. 'Twas high time, then! Your duel is as absolutely needed To the condition of a perfect gentleman, As paint and patches to a dame of fashion. Rosolia appears in the balcony. Ros. Good heavens! Adine! Adine! There's some one murder'd. Call up my father. Mont. (without) This way, this way, friends. Meph. Holla! my Faustus! time for us to fly. Faus. I ne'er shed blood till now. Meph. A peccadillo. Now you're a gentleman, you'll soon grow used To trifles of this sort. Faus. Would I lay there Instead of him. Meph. Why that might do as well; But come, away, away. No time for morals. [Mephistophiles drags off Faustus. Montolio, Antonio, and people rush in from all sides. Mon. How is it with you, man? En. The blow was hard Adine, Rosolia, Count di Casanova, and Servants with lights enter. Adine. Who is heâwho? Mon. The son of her who bore thee! Adine. My brother! Ros. Enrico! En. This is death! Why do you stand there with your idle howling? Come here, my sister, for you're still my sister. Nay, nearer, nearer. I've no breath to spare. Is't true? are youâthat which I would not name? What does she say? Stand from me, my good people. Adine. Oh, heavens! En. I understandâthe tale is true! Then welcome death! Montolio, my good friend, Bid the young falsehood spare her treach'rous tears. And, Rosoliaâkeep you from her side; She'll make you like herself. I warn you, sweet, As one, who, dying, loves you. Ros. Alas, he's dying! Adine. Oh, not dying! En. Hear the false whore. What should I do but die! I have not shoulders strong enough to bear A sister's infamy! Ah, Adine! [Enrico faints away. The rest group round him. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHORUS OF FISHERMEN on the water. Home! there's a storm in the whistling blast; Home! the sun is sinking fast! Home! Home! CHORUS OF HUNTERS on the mountains.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A splendid Room. Mephistophiles and Faustus seated at a table, with wine before them. Faus. I would I might forget that night of blood. Meph. Then drink, man, drink; wine is your only Lethe; Except indeed 'tis deathâbut that's a draught You men, with all your talking, find too bitter. Ha! yonder comes Adine.â Faus. I will not see her. Must I be tortur'd with her pray'rs and tears? I'm curst enough withoutâI will not see her. Meph. Ho! ho! he fears her! why I thought 'twas only Your well-tam'd husbands fear'd the gentler sex. Yet faith I cannot blame you: oh, you'll have An admirable lecture on the text Of murder and seduction.âI'll stand by And edify. Faus. I understand the sneer. Meph. No sneer, my friend; perhaps a little wonder That he who rules the fiend should fear a woman. [Exit. Enter Adine. Faus. Why's this Adine? why am I follow'd, hunted, Bay'd like a beast of blood? Is this the way, Think you, to win a lost affection? No weeping, no reproaches! Do you hear? I will not brook them. Adine. Do not fling me from you; Do not, dear Faustus; oh, if you desert me I'm lost indeed! Faus. Desert you? No: yon chest Is fill'd with diamonds, each more rich Than ever glitter'd on the Persian's brow; Take it, 'tis your's. Adine. You cannot mean this, Faustus. You are too kind, too nobleâwould not break The heart that loves you. Faus. Not contented yet! With this you may be all your sex desires. Would you have pleasure? why, this buys you pleasure; Would you have fame? why, here is honour's purchase; Would you have love? why one, the least of these, Will make you shine a Venus to men's eyes; Would you have titles; kingdoms have their price, And with this chest you may outbid the mightiestâ What more would you desire? Adine. Your love! your love! Which is more dear to me than name or fame; I've giv'n up all for you; do not desert me; Let me wait on you as your servant, slaveâ But do not cast me off. Faus. I do not, girl. I lov'd thee dearlyânay, would love thee still, But that thou wilt be passing, like a shadow, Betwixt me and my pleasuresâAnd in tears too! You know I hate these tears; I hate all sadness; They seem reproaches, and my inward soul Loathes all that would reproach me. Adine. No reproachesâ Noâno reproachesâSee, I weep no moreâ Or only tears of joy, to think that you Can love me still. I will be any thing That you would have me; I will be your fairy, Your merry, laughing, talking, singing fair. I'll be your shadow, and my pace shall be E'en as your pace is; I will be your echo, And still my voice shall sound but to your measure. Faus. Why, thou fond, foolish girlâBy yon bright sun, She is as fair as ever. Adine. Do you think so? Do you indeed? Faus. Aye, and the voice as sweet As when she first, in accents all as fine As the thin whispers of the murmuring leaf, Sang, more than said, âI love thee, dearest Faustus.â Adine. Could I but think so, I would win thee back As the fair Persianâshe whom poets call The Harem's Lightâwon back her sultan's love By her sweet musicâI will try it tooâ That smile assures meâI will try my spell. SONG. Oh, sweetly the noon-day's ending, Evening now sending Shades o'er the sea; 'Neath the window I would hear thee Singing near me, âCome, Love, to me.â Oh, sweetly the night-star's weeping, All are now sleeping O'er waves and o'er lea; From the mountain Sure I hear thee Singing near me, âCome, Love, to me.â Oh, darker the night is growing, Deeper throwing Shades soon to flee; Now I see thee, Now I hear thee Singing near me, âI come to thee.â Faus. I'm all thine own! This day our holy church Shall make our love as pure as 'tis devoted. And thou, dread pow'r, that wast not made for man, I do abjure thee. Enter Mephistophiles. Faus. Ha! what brings thee here? Hence! from my sight! Back to thy realms of fire! Avaunt! Meph. Wheugh! here's a fierce pelting storm of virtue! Faus. Avaunt, I say! Avaunt! Meph. But hear me first. Faus. I will hear nothingâHence! Meph. Well, here comes one Who will be heard. (retires.) Enter Montolio. Mon. (to Adine) I grieve to find thee here; You do not know he isâI had forgot; It were not well you knew it till I learn How far he's willing to repair your wrongs. Adine. What does this mean? Mon. No matter for the present;â I turn to you, sir. Faus. Well, and what to me? And who are you? Mon. My name, Montolio; I serve the king of Naples. Faus. Well, so much For name and service. Pray you now go on. Mon. You've wrong'd this lady in the dearest point That woman can be wrong'd in.âAs the friend To her lost brother, I demand if you Will heal that injury by instant marriage? Adine. He will, he will. Faus. Be silentâIf I will not,â For this sounds like a threat,âhow if I will not? Mon. I'll right her with my sword! Faus. Why then I will not! Adine. Faustusâdear FaustusâSet not, I conjure you, Your life and mine upon so fond a hazard. Faus. What! shall I write myself a coward? be This fellow's playthingâmoving as he pleases? Not I by heaven! Meph. Bravo! Bravissimo! Adine. For my sake, Faustus! I gave all for youâ For my sake, Faustus. Faus. No, not ev'n for thine,â And yet I love thee dearly. Mon. You'll hear from me anon. Faus. With all my heart! Mont. You, lady, must with me.â Faus. Aye, if she chuses, Not otherwiseâmust! must! chuse you, Adine? Adine. I will not leave my husband! Faus. Do not stay In hope of that; for it shall ne'er be said Faustus was like your dull, thrice cudgell'd ass, Moving in fear of what might else befal him. If you will stay, stay with me in defiance. Mon. Must I then speak it? He's your brother's murd'rer! Adine. Is this true, Faustus? No; you are no murderer. Faus. You're right; I am no murderer; he fell In fair and equal combat. Adine. Not by you? Faus. By me. Adine. (To Montolio) Lead me away, sir. Faus. How! you leave me? Adine. I leave you for the grave. Yet one word, signor; Ere I go with you, swear upon the cross To drop this duel. Mon. No; I cannot, lady. Adine. Then I stay with him.â Mon. Noble, noble girl, I must needs yield to you.âMy hand upon it. Adine. Farewell, dear Faustus; ev'n in death, dear Faustus, May you be happier than the poor Adine! [Exeunt Adine and Montolio. Faus. Is it for this I have toil'dâhave reach'd a height Where before me man never stood? For this Do I command the spirits that themselves Command the destinies of other men? How is this, Faustus? Meph. You're a cup too low, That's all; another glass will set all right. Faus. You here? Meph. The devil never leaves his friends. Faus. Her very kindness seem'd like scorn of me, As if she deem'd her cold moralities Set her above that mind, which, in its pow'r, Has made hell tremble. Meph. Why in truth she paid But slight respect to the all-learned Faustus. Faus. I'll think of her no more. Give me the wine; I'll riot in delights; I'll live whole years Of transport in a minute. Meph. Bravely said! Faus. There's not a beauty throughout wide Venice But shall be mine; I will have banquets, too; A hundred maidens, with no other robe Than their own flowing tresses, shall serve up, On plates of amethyst, immortal food; A hundred others shall present my wine In diamond goblets; the sweet air shall breathe The richest perfumes of the eastern rose, While the sun, stealing thro' a crimson veil, Sheds a mysterious light upon the beauty That floats around, till pleasure's self is breathless. Meph. Ay, this sounds well: go on in this way still, And you shall share the sceptre of a king Greater than he of Persia. Faus. Who is he? Meph. A friend of mine; he sate full high, and fell Fullolw; but what of that? Now, Rosolia; That is an enterprise! Faus. How so? how so? Meph. She loves another. Faus. Whom? Meph. Montolio. Faus. And that's another cause For me to love her, or at least to win her. Meph. A noble thought that! You are worth my friendship; You mend amazingly. Faus. Away! away! [Exeunt Faustus and Mephistophiles. SCENE II. Rosolia's Apartment in the Count di Casanova's Palace. [A balcony window opening upon a picturesque part of Venice, terminated by the Adriatic; sun-set gradually deepening into night. Enter Rosolia. Ros. 'Tis close upon the appointed minuteâ It is Montolio! true to the instant Of love's promise. Dear Montolio! [Rushes to the window, sees Faustus entering, and retreats alarmed. Ha! who art thou? What dost thou want? Faus. Yourself, fair lady. You expected a lover, did you not? Ros. (Half aside.) Has Montolio, then, betray'd me? Faus. Not so; Montolio's a right gallant spiritâsomewhat To forward perhaps, at times, In another's love affairs;âno matter; He knows not of this appointment; 'twas mine, By me contrived and made; and here I am, Young, ardent, fond, made up of passion. Ros. This is some madman, sure. Faus. Madman or not, I love thee. Upon thy ivory brow The amorous Cupid sits enthroned, and thence He shoots, with deadly aim, his burning shafts. [Approaches, and attempts to clasp her. Ros. Unhand me, villain! Faus. Hush!ânot so loud; you'll spoil all else!âbe still. If love's submissive pleadings please thee best, I'll kneel, And pour forth tears and sighs. I care not, I, Which way I win thy love, so I but win it. Trifle no longer with this moment, then, For mine thou must and shalt be. Ros. Off, and avoid me! Oh, Montolio! Why hast thou thus deserted or betray'd me? [Weeps. Faus. Ha! tears!âand of true affection! Faustus, hold! (Aside.) Be calm, sweet one, and hear me: Who or what I am it skills not to be told; But I loved theeâthat isâthy charms had wrought Upon my fancy; and if I will'd it, There is no human force or means could save thee From my passion's wildest mood. Ros. What art thou? Faus. Call all thy household up, and with a sign, (If they attempt to raise alarm) I'll charm Their tongues to dumbnessâfix them like statues, Rooted to earthâbearing thee the while, Thro' all opposing things, a thousand leagues, O'er sea and land, before thine eyes had wink'd. Ros. What is't you mean? Faus. I came hither, in recklessness of spirit, To win thee to my pleasuresâI confess it! And had one spark of lightness to love's faith Lurk'd in thy heart, pow'r had been given me To fan it to a flame, in whose destructive glow We both had revell'd. Oh, Adine! (Aside.) Ros. He seems A strange fearful being! would he were gone. Wag. (without) is heard crying Help, help, help! Ros. Good heaven, the street's in uproar, and the noise will alarm my father. Pray, sir, begone; should you be seen [Goes pointing him to window, and shrieks. Hah! a man is on the ladder! Wag. (without.) Help, help, or I'm caught. Faus. Fear nothing, lady; I'll be at hand, to turn your fears to safety. [He withdraws. A further noise, as of pursuit, is heard in the street, and Wagner crying out as ascending. Wag. Somebody help me up and in, for heaven's sake, or I am caught. Ros. That voice rather seems to fear than threaten danger. [Stands aside. [Wagner scrambles up, and tumbles over the balcony, in great alarm. Wag. Thank my lucky stars, I'm in at last; and thank my legs that got such a start of them. I'll make sure of the ladder, though, and secure my retreat. (Unfixes it.) Zounds, it has dropp'd over. No matter. Heugh; how they ran me. What with the fright and the flight, I'm completely out of breath! I wonder whose house I've tumbled into. Hey! (Turns and sees Rosolia.) Quam formosa! what a lovely creature! Ros. What is it you seek in this house? Wag. Vocula dulcisâgentle of speech! and what eyes!âblack, bright, and full, like my ink bottle. Ros. Am I to be savoured with an answer, sir? who are you, and what do you seek? Wag. I'm a poor scholar from Germanyâand I seek shelter. Ros. From what or whom? Wag. From an infernal long sword, and a parcel of long legs that were in full pursuit after me. A hue-and-cry followed us, but I kept the start; and seeing a ladder at your window, and thinking all fair at carnival time, I made bold to scramble upâtumble in, and here I am. Ros. A lover, and a coward. Wag. Something very like it, my lady; I was bred scholastice, non bellicosÃ©! books, not battles, are my business. I have plus leporis quam leonisârather more of the hare than the lion in me. Ros. Well, sir, your danger for the present seems past; you will, therefore, depart. Wag. You must let me out at the back-door, then, ma'am; for I unfix'd the ladder to prevent pursuit, and dropp'd it into the street. Ros. You must leap down. Wag. What over the balcony! Ros. 'Tis nothing. Wag. Nothing! oh, dear! Considerâmy bonesâ my brains! if I knock them out! pity a poor scholar! if you break his head, he's a bankrupt. [Kneels down and speaks in great terror; a knocking at the door. Casa. (without) Rosolia. Ros. Here's my father! up, sir, up, and away, before he enters. Wag. I'll be hanged if I do over the balcony, for fifty fathers. [Enter Casanova and sees him on his knees, and Rosolia endeavouring to raise him. Casa. Who the devil have you here, Rosolia, on his knees to you? Wag. (looking at Casa.) Noâwhy is it?âIt is. Casa. Confound itâthe very fellowâ Wag. Who caught you on your knees; and now, you catch me on mine, so we are likeââpar nobile.â I've got the lumbago; give me a handâhem! Casa. Hush! not a word of that. There. (Lifts him up.) Ros. (Aside) How odd!âmy father seems to know him. Casa. Rosolia, child; how came this fellow into your apartment? Ros. (Aside) What shall I say? Why, sir, as I was at my window, I was alarmed by a person hastily ascending the balcony, who has concealed himself somewhere about the room, when this gentleman followed with a party of friends in hot pursuit. Wag. (Aside) That's true; my friends were in hot pursuit. What's she at? Ros. And mounting by their means, I suppose, entered this room in a violent state of agitation. Wag. And that's true; I was in great agitation. Casa. I can discover no one. Wag. No, no, he's off, I warrant himâglad enough to escape. A cowardâa runawayâaâ(As he is going off, Faustus stands before him, and Wagner runs back across the stage.) Curse him, he's not gone after all; then I'm in a pretty mess. Ros. (Aside to Faustus.) Why have you appeared âcould you not have gone? Faus. (Aside to her.) Fear nothing; retire! [Exit Rosolia. Casa. (slapping Wagner on the back.) Now, sir, here's your man; and by his looks a proper and a gallant gentleman:âyou may decide your difference at once. Wag. (Not looking towards Faustus.) May I?â Yes, certainly; lead the way, signors! âI prÃ¦? Sequarâ âI'll be at your heelsâ(Aside)âand take to my own as soon as I'm out. Faus. I am ready for you, sir. Wag. (Aside.) 'Tis more than I am for you. Casa. Come quick, sir. Wag. Never be in a hurry; I always take my time and go coolly to this sort of work. Casa. You do, indeed; and if coolness be a sign of courage, you have plenty of it. Come. Wag. Well, I'll pray and wink; and if I open my eyes in another world, farewell, a poor scholar, that's all. âMors omnibus est communis.â (Draws.) After all, if I should find out upon trial I'm not a coward! Necessity, they say, makes cowards brave. [Advances timidly. Casa. Zounds, sir, look up; your point is wide. Faus. Aye, Wagner, look up. Wag. (Recovering.) Wagner! why who?âwhat âMagister meus!âmy dear master! (Throws down his sword, and runs into his arms.) Quomodo vales âa lucky meeting this! Sors beatissima! Casa. Ho, ho; have I the magician Faustus under my roof? Wag. You have; and his renowned and learned famulus, or pupilâthat's IâKarl Bartolomus Wagner. Casa. Then, master and pupil shall find a little work for the inquisition. Faus. Ha, ha, ha! Casa. Do you laugh! Ho! within. Suffer none to pass out; and dispatch a messenger to the holy office with the intelligence, that I have secured the magician Faustus, and his accomplice. Now, sirs, you must deal with the devil, indeed, if ye escape. Faus. Ha, ha, ha! Fear nothing, Wagner. Wag. Nothing, now. Sub auspice teneroâunder your shield I know I'm safe. Faus. (Speaking at the wing in a low voice.) Ho, Mephistophiles! Meph. (Without.) Masterâthy will. Faus. Seize Rosolia, slave, and steep Her senses in a sudden sleep. To Milan bear us, and ere the morn, To fondness for me turn her scorn. Meph. What more? FINALE &amp; CHORUS. Faustus, Wagner, Casa, &amp;c. Faus. To 'maze their senses, mock their eyes, Exact in visage, form, and size, Bid numbers like ourselves arise; Fall darknessâcome delusion, While we escape in the confusion. Casa. A plague on this darkness, so thick has it grown, A friend from a foe can no longer be known. Faus., Wag. Night's deep mantle o'er us throwing, We will plague you ere we're going. Ha, ha, ha! Casa. Hark! they laughâand now they're stealing Gently to their purposed flight; Cursed mischief, perhaps, concealing Under cover of the night. Faus. &amp; Wag. Ha, ha, ha! Casa. Yes; they hope to fly, 'tis plain, But the lights their plan revealing, All their hope will then be vain. Ho! without, there! Servants. We are ready, To our duty all are steady, Now for flight as they're preparing, Come we, flaming torches bearing. Faus. &amp; Fiends. Ha, ha, ha! Casa. Zounds, who are these?âmy senses they botherâ Fiends! there's no knowing one from the other. Officers of the Inquisition without. We come from the holy tribunal. Casa. The inquisitorsâgladly I go to admit them. Faus. &amp; Fiends. Ha, ha, ha. Casa., &amp;c. Magic wild, and dire delusion Rack our senses with confusion; Whirl our giddy brains around, Amaze our eyes, our hearts confound.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III SCENE I. A Room in Faustus' Palace. Faustus and Mephistophiles. Meph. I could be angry with you. Faus. Well, be angry. Meph. To carry her away, and all for nothing! From Venice here to Milan!âMy back aches for it. E'en Rosolia, if she be a woman, Must laugh at such an innocent! Faus. The better! Meph. Why did you bear her off then? Faus. Why? To please The humour of the moment, the wild whim, That tickled me, as laughter tickles fools, They know not wherefore. Plague not me for reasons; Had I a jot of reason, I'd not use The devil's company. Meph. One comfort still! Though she be innocent, her fame is gone; The rest will follow. She will scarcely be Such perfect fool to bear the plagues of virtue When all the profit's goneâI mean the name. But here the fair one comes. I spy a storm. She'll rate you soundly, doctor; yes, I spy it. 'Tis glimmering in her nose. I wish you joy. [Exit Mephistophiles. Faus. Her eye indeed looks angerâSimple fool!â I know not why, but in me is a scorn, A deadly withering scorn, of all that is, From the mean worm we tread on, to the thing Nature made last and greatestâwretched man! I'm weary of it all. Enter Rosolia. Ros. Oh, villain! villain! What spells, what dev'lish magic, did you use To witch my better senses? Faus. All men, lady, Use some art with your sex, to win its favour: Many prevail by wit, and more by titles; Some sing themselves into a lady's heart; And some have danc'd their way there; some have done The feat by a fair person; some, by gold; But most, by flattery. Now I, indeed, Us'd none of these: I bore you bravely off, And you, I know it, love me all the better. Ros. I will denounce thee! Faus. Will you so, indeed? Take my advice; be silent! Ros. Villain! Faus. Woman! Ros. I'll have revengeâI willâand such revengeâ If there is law in Milan. Faus. Woman still. Ros. What! do you mock me, wretch? Faus. A little, lady; Pray you excuse it; we'll be better friends. Ros. Unhand me, sorcerer! I will not stay. Faus. Thou hast no choice; be rooted there in silence. [Rosolia sinks into a chair. Dost feel my spell upon thee? But fear not; I will but show thee what my power can do, That thou may'st cease to struggle with it. Look! by mine art, Thou shalt see distant Venice and our friends As if reflected on a mirror.âLook! On the air, as on a glass, Shadows of the moment, pass; I have bid you once and twice, Spirits, I have bid you thrice. [Music.âThe scene opens and discovers, as in a mirror, the interior of a cemetery, where the body of Enrico lies. Faus. Spirits, ye obey me well; Change again, and at my spell Show us how they kneel in pray'r, Monks and lords and ladies fair. [Music.âThe vision changes to the Interior of a Church, where the Count di Casanova, Orsini, &amp;c. appear. Faus. Away! Away! Dull visions, pass! And on thy magic glass Show Naples' Bay. [Music.âThe Scene changes to the Bay of Naples. âContinued Music.âLoud knocking at the doorâthe vision instantly passes away, and the apartment resumes its original appearance. Rosolia starts up. Faus. The sound dissolves my spell. Roso. Help! Help! [The door is burst open. An Officer and Soldiers enter. Off. You are our prisoner. Faus. Art sure of that? Off. The Countess Rosolia! I much grieve A daughter of your house should e'er be found As I find you. Faus. In truth it must be own'd A parlous meeting for a maiden's fame! Alone, sir, with a man!â Fie, lady, fie! I blush for you, indeed. Ros. Oh, monstrous villainy! I'll to the king; He'll right me on thee, sorcerer. Faus. Farewell! [Exit Rosolia. A shrewd young vixen! Are you married, sir? Off. His impudence confounds me! Faus. For, if not, I recommend the lady; crede experto; She's young, sir, as you see; dark sparkling eyes; A tolerable brow; her nose indeed Is somewhat of the shortest; but her tongueâ That's long enough I promise you. Off. Do I dream? Faus. Oh, marry herâby all means marry her; I see it by your brow (but that's a secret) You were ordained a cuckold. Off. Seize and bind him! Faus. You'll ask my good will first. Ho, Mephistophiles! Quick! to my rescue! by that wordâthat word!â Why, Mephistophiles! Off. Thy fiend deserts thee. Bear him to prison. [They seize him. Faus. Dost thou leave me, fiend? Off. As he leaves all who trust him. Faus. Dost desert me? I do implore thee! Mephistophiles! Off. Off with him! Faus. No; if I must die, I'll die Here, on this spot, and not by hangman hands. [He suddenly breaks from them, and, drawing out a pistol, is about to shoot himself, when Mephistophiles appears, and beats down his hand as he fires. Meph. Stop, my dear Faustusânot that I object To this same suicide; I like the deed; But 'tis not yet your time. Off. What being's that? Whence did he come? Faus. Quick! save me, I command thee! Meph. So brave, too, on the sudden? I command thee! Good bye, dear domine! Faus. Stay, false one! stay! Dost thou not fear my power? Meph. Try me. Faus. Stay! Music. Faustus seizes the hand of Mephistophiles. Thunder; the Demon sinks. Faus. That icy touch has wither'd me. I'm lost! Off. Away with him! Faus. Nay, sirs; it shall not need; I am your prisonerâif it must be so; But keep your base hands from me. I am your'sâ This wretched body's your's, and for my soulâ There lies the secret! I shall know it soon. Off. You must away. Faus. Well, fellow; lead you onâ I shall be free the sooner of your presence. [The Soldiers bear off Faustus, followed by the Officer. SCENE II. Before the Inn, as in Act I. Enter Grognoso, the Innkeeper, and Brevillo, his Servant. Bre. Oh, MasterâMaster Grognoso, listen to me! Grog. Well, Brevillo, what have you to say? Bre. I want to be married. Grog. To whom? Bre. To your daughter Lucetta. Grog. You are free and easy. Bre. No; I'm free, but not easyâI should be much easier, were I no longer free; therefore, I wish to marry, and set up for myself. Grog. Set up for yourself, thenâwho hinders you? But how dare you set up for my daughter?âyou, who have spread my napkins, opened my bottles, and cheated my customers for these ten yearsâhow dare you think of my daughter as a wife? Bre. And why not? What have you been but a napkin-spreader and a bottle-opener yourself? and as to cheating customers, under whom have I learnt, pray?âWill you give me your daughter? Grog. No; she loves another, and I won't. I'm for the freedom of the affections. I'm a soft-hearted father, though I don't look soâI was once a victim myself to the tender passion. Bre. Were you? you're what you look like now, however. Grog. What's that? Bre. The butcher of it. I'm goingâ Enter Lucetta. Luc. Where are you going, Brevillo? Bre. To death. Luc. A pleasant journey to you. Grog. And write when you get there, will you? Bre. Wicked wretches! Grog. But, in the mean time, hadn't you better go and see what letters are for the house at the post-office? Bre. Your heart's harder than an anvil. [Exit Brevillo. Enter Wagner. Wag. Father-in-law and Mrs. Wagner elect, I'm happy to see you. Lucetta, give me a kiss. Luc. May I, father? Grog. Why he looks as if he may be trusted, and you look as if you'd like to open an account with him. Wag. (Kisses her.) âDulce est desipere in locoâ ââ'Tis pleasant to kiss where 'tis properââbut I must away to Milan. Luc. To Milan! what's the matter now? Wag. Why there's been the devil to pay in Venice. Grog. Then your old master, Faustus, has been called to account, I'll warrant. Wag. He has, pretty lustily; and is likely to be made pay in full: the Countess Rosolia has been spirited away to Milan, and there made the victim of his devilish spells; she's frantic with shame and rage; he's thrown into a dungeon, and all her friends are away thither, to urge the king to the utmost severity against him. Luc. And what's become of the poor Lady Adine? Wag. Nobody knows. The moment she heard of Faustus' crimes and danger, she shrieked and fell senseless; when she recovered, it was but too plain her brain was bewildered, and in this state she escaped, and fled, no one knows whither. Grog. Poor soul! Luc. But why need you go after Faustus to Milan, Wagner? Wag. I've still a sneaking love for him, for old kindness' sake, and I'd e'en see if I can help him in his extremity. Grog. Good! (Shaking Wagner by the hand.) Never forsake an old friend, though he be the devil himself. Luc. But how if they should put you in prison for a conjuror? Wag. Look in my face! the inquisitors themselves, at one glance, would exclaim âIngenui vultÃ»s puer,â and swear I was no conjuror. Re-enter Brevillo. Bre. Here are your letters. Wag. Who is this little youth? Grog. My servant, by name Brevillo. Wag. Brief in stature and intellectâhe is well nominated. Grog. And, moreover, aspires to become my son-in-law. Wag. (To Brevillo.) Why thou imp of a pottle pot! how darest thou look up to thy master's daughter? hast any pretensionsâeh? Bre. Plenty: my own consent, something snug in my pocket, and a sharp wit to make it more. Wag. Hast studied? Bre. Yes. Wag. What? Bre. How to give short measures, and make long bills. Wag. Incipe, didst ask Lucetta's consent? Luc. He did; and I said no. Wag. And her father's? Grog. He did, and I said no. Wag. Conclusiveâlive in peace and die a bachelor. Bre. Why perhaps that's the surest way to live in peace. QUARTETTE. Grognoso, Brevillo, Wagner, and Lucetta. Bre. A bachelor he may show his cares A fair pair of heels; but a wife Is a kind of a clog, or a teazing bur That sticks to your skirts thro' life. Wag. He remembers the fable, the fox and the grapes, And wisely his course by necessity shapes. Omnes. He remembers, &amp;c. Luc. In marriage 'tis love smooths the furrows of care; 'Tis love makes it pleasure its burthens to share; 'Tis love gives us courage life's battles to fight, And sheds o'er its darkest of sorrows a light. Wag. A little love, Grog. A little wine, Bre. A little ready money, Grog. Make marriage life a lot divine, A land of milk and honey. Omnes. A little love, a little wine, A little ready money, Make marriage life a lot divine, A land of milk and honey. [Exeunt into the Inn. SCENE I. Interior of a Prison. Faustus alone. Faus. And is it come to this? and must I dieâ Die like a felon midst the rabble's curse? When the sun setsâthe sun has almost set! Is there no hope? Have heaven and hell renounc'd me? That I were dead! That I had never been! Curs'd be the womb that bore me! curs'd be the hour That gave me being! curs'd be the fiend Who thus betrays me! doubly curs'd myself Who could be so betray'd! Mephistophiles rises through the earth. Meph. You curse it bravely! Faus. You here! then I am safe! I shall not die! You come to free me. Quick! Off with these chains! Meph. They're off! [Touching the chains which drop off. Faus. Now lead me hence. Meph. On one conditionâ A trifle merely, but the devil, my friend, Has his own whims, as well as man. Faus. Quickâname it. Meph. In good time, Domine; but what is this? Dry bread and water!âexcellent provision! Faus. Dost mock my anguish? Meph. Who Iâmock my friend? That were too like a man; I'm but the devil. Faus. Name your conditionâquick. Meph. 'Tis but to cut The throat of some dull sleeper. Faus. What! Do murder? Meph. Well, fool, and what of murder? Tut! a name! Your hangman murders, for the law commands it; Your doctor murders, for his art allows it; Your soldier murders, for his honour bids it; And why should you, when your own neck's in question, Pause for a little blood? Come, you shall do it. Faus. No! Never! Never! Meph. As you please, my friend; 'Tis but a little racking, screwing, bruising, And after burning at a gentle fire. Faus. Have I no power? was that charm illusion? Is he no more my slave? Meph. Why, thou dull fool, Dost thou not see I play'd with thee? But, hark! I hear them coming. Fare thee well. Faus. Stay! stay! Meph. Wilt do the deed? Faus. Oh, wretched, wretched Faustus! Meph. Hark! they unbar the bolts! another minute, And e'en the devil can't save you. Quick! Decide! The last chain falls! the last bolt is removing! Wilt do the deed? Faus. Shame on thee, Faustus! coward! I will not do it, fiend! Meph. They come! Faus. I care not. I will not be thy fool; the worst is death, And in me is a power to brave that death In its worst form; I do defy thee, fiend. Meph. 'Tis bravely said. I like thee all the better; I will requite thee for't. Passâpass, I say! MusicâThe Scenechanges to the Ante-Room of the Royal Bed-chamber. Thou'lt do no murderâthat is, vulgar murderâ Not for a purseânot for a few poor ducats. Thou'rt right, my friend. But in the way of honour, Or for a womanâor, perhaps, a crownâ Faus. A crown! what mean'st thou? By that fearful smile Thou think'st thou art my master. Meph. No, thy slave. Look, Faustus, there he sleeps; the King of Naples. Put him asideâone thrust will do the bus'ness, And thou shalt wear his formâbe Naples' monarch. Dost hear? Thou hast thy choice: a regal throne, Or death upon the scaffold. Canst thou doubt? Faus. Speak not so loudly! Meph. (Aside.) Is it so! I see. (To Faustus.) You need not fear his waking; I have set A spell upon his slumber. Faus. Not that I Need care about his slumber. Meph. No, indeed. But wilt thou be a king?âa king, my Faustus? Within that name lies all that earth can give; Snatch the crown bravely: thou hast swell'd with wealth, Hast rioted in pleasures; but to rule The destinies of men is more than wealthâ Is more than pleasure: why the name alone Inspires the very devil. Thou must do it. Faus. Hush! hark! I hear him stirring. Meph. Why, then, put Three inches of cold steel here in his breast, And that will cure his stirring; but be quick. Faus. Pray'r may do much, and penance more, to wash The stain of blood away. Meph. Aye, to be sure; Repent at any time (and cheat the devilâaside.) Come, let us seal our compact. Faus. No! I'll make no bond with thee. Meph. Who talk'd of bonds! I hate all bondsâwould have all men be free From ev'ry curb, whatever you may call it, Law, moral, or religion. Faus. But I meantâ Meph. You mean as I do, and I love you for it. Arise! arise! [Music. A banquet rises. Here's to the future king. Will you not pledge me? Faus. No, dull tempter, no; That which I do, I'll do it like myself; Not from vain terror or more vain temptation. Does he sleep still? Meph. It seems so. Faus. Aye, it seems so! All is but seeming; virtue is but seeming; There's nothing true but self. I'd be a king! Meph. Well, be so, then. Faus. Is there no other price? Meph. He'll wake anon. Faus. Is there no other price? Meph. Not if you buy of me. Faus. Give me the dagger. Meph. You will not do it; no, I see you will not. Faus. Give me the dagger. Meph. Why, I gave it now; Has your fear blinded you? Faus. I'll snatch the crown, Tho' it were bound upon his head with iron. Meph. But will you do it? Are you sureâquite sure You've heart to look on blood? at midnight, too? I almost quake myself. Faus. Eternal scoffer! Thine own hell swallow thee! [Faustus rushes into the inner room. Meph. All in good timeâ And this is man! and this his boasted reason! Rejoice, ye spirits of darkness! he is our's! Chorus below. Rejoice! rejoice! rejoice! [Wild Music. The lights go out; the banquet sinks. You understand me; in those tones I hear Your many voices. He is long about itâ A bungler in the tradeâhalf saint, half sinner. [Faustus re-enters with a bloody dagger. Faus. Where art thou, Mephistophiles? Meph. (Ascending the staircase.) I'm here. [As Mephistophiles speaks, his figure becomes tall and dark, as on his first appearance. Faus. What dreadful change is this? [Knocking at the door. Meph. Thy subjects call. Faus. I charge thee stay! [Rushing up the stairs. Meph. Back, King of Naples, back! [Music. As Faustus approaches Mephistophiles, a vivid flash of lightning passes between them; Faustus utters a loud cry of terror, and rushes back; at the same moment the door is burst open, and Montolio and Attendants enter with lights; Faustus appears in regal attire; corresponding music during the whole of the action. Mon. We heard your voice, most gracious king, and fear'dâ Faus. Whom call'd you king? Mon. Whom but your majesty? Faus. I'm King of Naples? Mon. Sire! Faus. And nothing chang'd? Mon. My liege, I understand you not. Faus. 'Tis likeâ 'Tis very likeâI doubtâSearch yonder room, And tell me what you see. [Montolio enters the inner room. His hand of fire Was on my brow, and shot thro' all my being, Like summer lightning through the leafy oak. But am I, then, that king? And can it be I wear a form that yet does not belong To mine own consciousness? I am not chang'd; My mind's not chang'dâand yetâhere comes the proof. Montolio enters. Mon. My liege, I foundâ Faus. Thou hast found nothing, knave; What could'st thou find? Mon. If you will hear me, sire. Faus. I will not hear thee, man; thou hast found nothing. Mon. 'Tis that which I would say; I have found nothing. Faus. Nor was there any blood upon the floor. Mon. My liege? Faus. I say there was no blood upon the floor. Wilt dare deny my word? Mon. Such rebel thought Was never in my heartâno blood has stained The floor of yonder room. Faus. Then I'm a king. [Music without. What means that music, sir? Mon. The morn is up, And those glad voices welcome in the day Which gave your highness birth. Faus. It is, indeed, The birthday of my sovereigntyâyou're right. [Music. Nobles and Ladies enter and kneel before Faustus, presenting their offerings. The Scene closes. SCENE IV. A Street in Naples. Enter Count di Casanova and Orsini. Ors. 'Tis a strange summons this the king has sent us. Casa. That devil Faustus Has o'er his better senses cast some spell, To clear himself, and to confound us all. I've had a taste of his mad pranks that way. But now, when for my daughter I seek redress, To be warn'd not to bear Myself unjustly 'gainst the murderer Of a daughter's honor, 'tis rank insult! Ors. And of Adine, too!âThe murderer Of her honor, senses, perhaps her life. Nor throne nor altar shall protect him. Against the leaguer'd powers of hell itself: But with firm temper let us bear our course Before the king. Casa. Away, and teach this Milan king That Venice nobles brook no trifling. Come! 'Tis time we were in the court. Ors. Away! [Exeunt. Enter Wagner and Lucetta on the opposite side. Luc. Nay, Wagner, pray go not; the king, you hear, has strangely changed in conduct towards Faustus, and shews favour to him. Should this anger his enemies, they may turn their wrath on you. Wag. No fear of that; if the king's his friend, he's mine, and I'm safe by proxy. If Faustus gets clear, and into favor with the king, why our fortunes are made here in Milan. Luc. But suppose Faustus be condemned. Wag. Why then he must look to himself, and we must be off. I'll be back to thee at our lodgings, the moment I see how matters turn; and if unluckily, we'll away to Germany, where I've a snug little cottage to shelter thee. Art thou content, Lucetta? Luc. Yes, truly, am I. Wag. 'Tis a snug place. There are books and a gammon of bacon within doors, and a pig in a stye, and a cow in a paddock without. Luc. Well, you are a merry kind-hearted fellow, and your face like your heart is always smiling. I always thought you scholars were dull sulky people. Wag. There are your dull heavy commentators, the cart-horses of literature. I've a little more of the blood in me, and will shew thee a pleasanter course to canter over. Attend, and be instructed. DUET. Wagner and Lucetta. Wag. Hearken, damsel, to me, and I'll teach thee The very first lesson of love. Luc. Kind sir, then begin, I beseech thee, And I'll do my best to improve. Wag. Now say after meâAmo! Luc. Amo! Wag. Again! Luc. Amo! oh, oh! Both. Oh, oh! Wag. Now construe it. Luc. I will. Wag. Attend, And then the first lesson shall end. Amo! I love, I am loving, or do love. Luc. Amo! I love, I am loving, or do love, And the love that I feel shall be ever a true love. Wag. Bene, bene, cor meum, I see you'll improve. Luc. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall quickly improve. Both. Oh, yes, I am sure I shall/You will quickly improve, And bless the conjunction of learning and love. [Exeunt. SCENE THE FIFTH AND LAST. The Grand Audience Chamber. Count di Casanova, Montolio, Orsini, Rosolia, and Neapolitan Lords and Ladies. Ors. The king stays long. Mon. Aye, longer than he's wont, But he is strangely shaken by a fever Of mind and frame; I dare not call it madness. Casa. Mad! we're all mad I think. Ros. And if we are not 'Tis more than wonderâwe've seen enough To craze the strongest senses. Casa. Hush! He comes! Flourish.âFaustus enters as King. Faus. I look'd not for Venetians in my court,â For, are you not of Venice? By your garb You should be of that land, to which we owe But little love in Naples. Ors. Sire, we come For justice. Faus. Aye! on whom? Mon. A base seducer! Ors. A practiser of witchcraft! Casa. An assassin! Faus. A fearful list, my friends. And who is this, This base seducer, wizzard, murderer? Ors. The German, Faustus. Faus. Oh, the German, Faustus; He stands condemn'd already to the stake; 'Tis pity that he has but one poor life To answer all of you. Ors. By yon bright sun, The king is mocking us. Faus. What's that you mutter? Casa. Be still, Orsini; I do spy near peril. Ors. I care not I; I will not be the jest Of king or emperor. Faus. Off with them all; They all are leagu'd, and all shall die. Ors. For what? For being enemies to Faustus? Faus. Yes; For being enemies to Faustus, knave. Mon. My gracious liege! Faus. What! shall we be controul'd? Is not our will your law? Mon. Yes, when that will Is just. Faus. Away with them, I say, to death. Mon. Let me entreat you, sire. Faus. They all shall die. Voice. (without) Murder! Faus. Who calls my justice murder?âspeakâ Who is the rebel? let him stand before me. Voice. (without) Murder! Faus. Again! Will no voice show the traitor? [Low plaintive Music sounds; all seem subdued as if by some supernatural influence. Faus. So soft! and yet so terrible! And yeâ Ye all look pale. [Music again. But I'm a fool to be The dupe thus of mine earsâWhat ho, there! guards! Adine rushes on; in her hand is a lyre. All. Adine! Faus. What would you have? what brings you here? Adine. To save thee, Faustus. All. Faustus! Faus. She is mad. Adine. Yes, I am madâbut yet I know thee, Faustus. Yes, I am madâbut I would save thee, Faustus. 'Tis thus I saw thee in my vision's hourâ With all the dreadful attributes of kings Dispensing death and terror.âThen, as now, I warn'd thee to repentâI bade thee look Upon the clouds that hasten on the sun; The instant they eclipse its light, your time Of penitence is past. Faus. Why, Adineâmy Adine, I sayâwhat fiend has sent thee hither? Adine. It was to save thee from the fiend, and not The fiend that sent me. Faus. Sirs, let some one look To the poor maniac; I should be griev'd That any harm betided her.âPoor Adine! Adine. See, Faustus,âhow they roll!ârollâroll!âRepent!â Oh, let my voice woo thee back again to heaven, As once the minstrel woo'd the maniac king From the bad terrors of his evil mind. Faus. What terrors? what evils? or what to me Are your mad minstrels? I am king of Naples: And king I will be.âHad I pow'r to gain This dazzling height, I have the pow'r to keep it, Come what will come. Adine. Be hush'd! be hush'd! RECITATIVE AND AIR. Recitative. Oh Saul! Oh king! Wake from this fearful dream! The chains that bind Thy horror-haunted mind, Drop from thee as the stream Of music gushes from the trembling string. Air. Softly, softly breathe, my lyre, Stilling ev'ry wild desire! Let thy music fall as sweet On the open anxious ear, As the odours on the sense, When the summer's close is near. Faus. Adine! Adine! With those sweet tones comes back The memory of otherâhappier times. Recitative. More softâmore slow The measure flow! Softerâslower yet, Till the sweet sound beget A joy that melts like woe! Faus. I thought this heart was rock; but there's a might In that sweet voice, that, like the sacred rod, Can call forth living waters from the rock! Adine! Mine own Adine! for oh, again I'm all thine own. Come to meâshare with me This regal seat! Adine. The steps are red with blood. Faus. What dost thou say? Adine. Descend from that red throneâ Descend, ere 'tis too late. Faus. Her madness speaks With the sad voice of inspiration. Adine. Faustus! In my heart's anguishâby the love I bore And bear you stillâdescendârepentâOh, see The clouds move rapidly. Faus. 'Tis madness all, I will not be the fool thus of my senses. Why do all mock me with those ghasted faces? What have you heard or seen, that you all stand So maz'd and motionless? Adine. That you could feel so! A moment, and you're lostâfor ever lost! Think on that awful wordâfor everâever. Pause but a little timeâoh, Faustus, Faustus! The fiery gulph is yawning to receive you; The demon has his hand outstretch'd to gripe you. Faus. Then let the demon come. [The sun is eclipsed, and leaves the scene in utter darkness. A Voice (without) I come! All. Ah, horror! [All rush out except Adine. The building falls, and the demon appearing in clouds and fire, seizes Faustus. Faus. AdineâAdineâlostâlostâfor ever lost! Music. She rushes towards him, when the earth opens before them, and vomits forth fire. Adine falls. THE END.</field>
