      <field name="fulltext">I haue now taken occasion to satisfie many, who long since were desirous that the Lords maske should be published, which (but for some priuate lets, had in due time come forth. The Scene was diuided into two parts from the roofe to the floore, the lower part being first discouered (vpon the sound of a double consort, exprest by seuerall instruments, plac't on either side of the roome) there appeared a Wood in prospectiue, the innermost part being of releaue, or whole round, the rest painted. On the left hand from the seate was a Caue, and on the right a thicket, out of which came Orpheus, who was attired after the old Greeke manner, his haire curled, and long; a lawrell wreath on his head; and in his hand hee bare a siluer bird, about him tamely placed seuerall wild beasts, and vpon the ceasing of the Consort Orpheus spake. Orphevs. Agen, agen, fresh kindle PhÅbus sounds, T'exhale Mania from her earthie den; Allay the furie that her sense confounds, And call her gently forth, sound, sound, agen. The Consorts both sound againe, and Mania the Goddesse of madnesse appeares wildly out of her caue. Her habit was confused and strange; but yet gracefull, shee as one amazed speaks. Mania. What powerfull noise is this importunes me, T'abandon darkenesse which my humour fits? Ioues hand in it I feele, and euer he Must be obai'd eu'n of the franticst wits. Orpheus. Mania? Mania. Hah. Orpheus. Braine-sick, why start'st thou so? Approch yet nearer, and thou then shalt know The will of Ioue, which he will breath from me, Mania. Who art thou? if my dazeled eyes can see, Thou art the sweet Enchanter heau'nly Orpheus. Orpheus. The same Mania, and Ioue greets thee thus, Though seuerall power to thee, and charge he gaue, T'enclose in thy Dominions such as raue Through blouds distemper, how durst thou attempt T'imprison Entheus, whose rage is exempt From vulgar censure? it is all diuine Full of celestiall rapture, that can shine Through darkest shadowes, therefore Ioue by me Commands thy power strait to set Entheus free. Mania. How can I? Franticks, with him many more In one caue are lockt vp, ope once the dore, All will flie out, and through the world disturbe, The peace of Ioue; for, what power then can curbe Their rainelesse furie?â Orpheus. âLet not feare in vaine Trouble thy crazed fancie, all againe Saue Entheus to thy safeguard shall retire, For Ioue into our musick will inspire The power of passion, that their thoughts shall bend To any forme or motion we intend: Obey Ioues willing then, go, set Entheus free. Mania. I willing go, so Ioue obey'd must bee. Orph. Let Musicke put on Protean changes now, Wilde beasts it once tam'd, now let Franticks bow. At the sound of a strange musicke twelue Franticks enter, six men, and six women, all presented in sundry habits and humours: there was the Louer, the Selfe-louer, the melancholickeman full of feare, the Schoole-man ouer-come with phantasie, the ouer-watched Vsurer, with others that made an absolute medly of madnesse, in middest of whom Entheus (or Poeticke furie) was hurried forth, and tost vp and downe, till by vertue of a new change in the musicke, the Lunatickes fell into a madde measure, fitted to a loud phantasticke tune, but in the end thereof the musick changed into a very solemne ayre, which they softly played, while Orpheus spake. Orph. Through these soft and calme sounds Mania passe With thy Phantasticks hence; heere is no place Longer for them or thee; Entheus alone Must do Ioues bidding now, all else be gone. During this speech, Mania with her Franticks depart, leauing Entheus behind them, who was attired in a close Curace of the Anticke fashion, Bases with labels, a Roabe fastned to his shoulders, and hanging downe behind; on his head a wreath of Lawrell, out of which grew a paire of wings, in the one hand he held a booke, and in the other a pen. Enth. Diuinest Orpheus, Ã´ how all from thee Proceed with wondrous sweetnesse, am I free? Is my affliction vanish't? Orph. âToo too long Alas, good Entheus, hast thou brook't this wrong; What? number thee with madmen? Ã´ mad age, Sencelesse of thee, and thy celestiall rage. For thy excelling rapture, eu'n through things That seems most light, is borne with sacred wings: Nor are these Musicks, Showes, or Reuels vaine, When thou adorn'st them with thy PhÅbean braine; Th'are pallate sicke of much more vanitie, That cannot taste them in their dignitie. Ioue therefore lets thy prison'd spright obtaine Her libertie and fiery scope againe: And heere by me commands thee to create Inuentions rare, this night to celebrate, Such as become a nuptiall by his will Begun and ended,â Enth. âIoue I honor still, And must obey, Orpheus I feele the fires Are reddy in my braine, which Ioue enspires, Loe, through that vaile, I see Prometheus stand Before those glorious lights, which his false hand Stole out of heau'n, the dull earth to enflame With the affects of Loue, and honor'd Fame, I view them plaine in pompe and maiestie. Such as being seene might hold riualitie, With the best triumphes; Orpheus giue a call With thy charm'd musicke, and discouer all. Orph. Flie cheerfull voices, through the ayre, and clear These clouds, that yon hid beautie may appeare. A Song. 1 Come away; bring thy golden theft, Bring bright Prometheus all thy lights, Thy fires from Heau'n bereft Shew now to humane sights. Come quickly, come, thy stars to our stars straight present, For pleasure being too much defer'd, loseth her best c?t?t, What fair dames wish, should swift as their own thoughts appeare, To louing &amp; to longing harts euery houre seemes a yeare. 2 See how faire: O how faire they shine, What yeelds more pompe beneath the skies? Their birth is yet diuine, And such their forme implies. Large grow their beames, their nere approch afford th?so By nature sights that pleasing are, c?not too amply show, O might these flames in humane shapes desc?d this place, How louely would their presence be, how full of grace! In the end of the first part of this Song, the vpper part of the Scene was discouered by the sodaine fall of a curtaine, then in clowdes of seuerall colours (the vpper part of them being fierie, and the middle heightned with siluer) appeared eight Starres of extraordinarie bignesse, which so were placed, as that they seemed to be fixed betweene the Firmament and the Earth; in the front of the Scene stood Prometheus, attyred as one of the ancient Heroes. Enth. Patron of mankinde, powerfull and bounteous, Rich in thy flames, reuerend Prometheus, In Hymens place aide vs to solempnize These royall Nuptials, fill the lookers eyes With admiration of thy fire and light, And from thy hand let wonders flow to night. Prom. Entheus and Orpheus names both deare to me, In equall ballance I your Third will be In this nights honour, view these heau'n borne Starres, Who by my stealth are become Sublunars. How well their natiue beauties fit this place, Which with a chorall dance they first shall grace, Then shall their formes to humane figures turne, And these bright fires within their bosomes burne. Orpheus apply thy musick for it well Helps to induce a Courtly miracle. Orp. Sound best of Musicks, raise yet higher our sprights, While we admire Prometheus dancing lights. A Song. 1 A duance your Chorall motions now You musick-louing lights, This night concludes the nuptiall vow, Make this the best of nights, So brauely Crowne it with your beames, That it may liue in fame, As long as Rhenus or the Thames Are knowne by either name. 2 Once moue againe, yet nearer moue Your formes at willing view, Such faire effects of ioy and loue, None can expresse but you, Then reuell midst your ayrie Bowres Till all the clouds doe sweat, That pleasure may be powr'd in showres On this triumphant Seat. 3 Long since hath louely Flora throwne Her Flowers and Garlands here, Rich Ceres all her wealth hath showne, Prowde of her daintie cheare. Chang'd then to humane shape descend, Clad in familiar weede. That euery eye may here commend The kinde delights you breede. According to the humour of this Song, the Starres mooued in an exceeding strange and delightfull maner, and I suppose fewe haue euer seene more neate artifice, then Master Innigoe Iones shewed in contriuing their Motion, who in all the rest of the workmanship which belong'd to the whole inuention, shewed extraordinarie industrie and skill, which if it be not as liuely exprest in writing as it appeared in view, robbe not him of his due, but lay the blame on my want of right apprhending his instructions for the adoring of his Arte. But to returne to our purpose; about the end of this Song, the Starres suddainely vanished, as if they had beene drowned amongst the Cloudes, and the eight Maskers appeared in their habits, which were infinitly rich, befitting States (such as indeede they all were) as also a time so farre heightned the day before, with all the richest shew of solemnitie that could be inuented. The ground of their attires was massie Cloth of Siluer, embossed with flames of Embroidery, on their heads, they had Crownes, Flames made all of Gold-plate Enameled, and on the top a Feather of Silke, representing a cloude of smoake. Vpon their new transformation, the whole ScÃ¦ne being Cloudes dispersed, and there appeared an Element of artificiall fires, with seuerall circles of lights, in continuall motion, representing the house of Prometheus, who then thus applies his speech to the Maskers. They are transformed. Prometh. So, pause awhile, and come yee fierie spirits, Breake forth the earth like sparks t'attend these Knights. Sixteene Pages like fierie spirits, all their attires bing alike composed of flames, with fierie Wings and Bases, bearing in either hand a Torch of Virgine Waxe, come forth below dauncing a lively measure, and the Daunce being ended, Prometheus speakes to them from aboue. The Torch-bearers Daunce. Pro. VVait spirits wait, while through the clouds we pace, And by descending gaine a hier place. The Pages returne toward the ScÃ¦ne, to giue their attendance to the Maskers with their lights: from the side of the ScÃ¦ne appeared a bright and transparant cloud, which reached from the top of the heauens to the earth: on this cloud the Maskers led by Prometheus, descended with the musicke of a full song; and at the end of their descent, the cloud brake in twaine, and one part of it (as with a winde) was blowne ouerthwart the ScÃ¦ne. While this cloud was vanishing, the wood being the vnder-part of the ScÃ¦ne, was insensibly changed, and in place thereof appeared foure Noble women-statues of siluer, standing in seuerall nices, accompanied with ornaments of Architecture, which filled all the end of the house, and seemed to be all of gold-smithes work. The first order consisted of Pillasters all of gold, set with Rubies, Saphyrs, Emeralds, Opals, and such like. The Capitels were composed, and of a new inuention. Ouer this was a bastard order with Cartouses reuersed, comming from the Capitels of euery Pillaster, which made the vpper part rich and full of ornament. Ouer euery statue was placed a history in gold, which seemed to be of base releaue; the conceits which were figured in them were these. In the first was Prometheus, embossing in clay the figure of a woman, in the second he was represented stealing fire from the chariot-wheele of the Sunne: in the third, he is exprest putting life with this fire into his figure of clay; and in the fourth square, Iupiter enraged, turnes these new made women into statues. Aboue all, for finishing, ran a Cornish, which returned ouer euery Pillaster, seeming all of gold and richly carued. A full Song. Svpported now by Clouds descend, Diuine Prometheus, Hymens friend, Leade downe the new transformed fires, And fill their breasts with loues desires: That they may reuell with delight, And celebrate this nuptiall night, So celebrate this nuptiall night, That all which see may stay. They neuer viewed so faire a sight, Euen on the cleerest day. While this Song is sung, and the Maskers court the sowre new transformed Ladies, foure other Statues appeare in their places. Entheus. See, see Prometheus, foure of these first dames Which thou long since out of thy purchac't flames, Did'st forge with heau'nly fire, as they were then, By Ioue transformed to Statues, so agen, They suddenly appeare by his command At thy arriuall, Loe how fixt they stand, So did Ioues wrath too long, but now at last, It by degrees relents, and he hath plac't These Statues, that we might his ayde implore, First for the life of these, and then for more. Prom. Entheus, Thy councels are diuine and iust, Let Orpheus decke thy Hymne, since pray we must. The first Inuocation in a full Song. Powerfull Ioue, that of bright starres, Now hast made men fit for warres; Thy power in these Statues proue, And make them women fit for loue. Orpheus. See Ioue is pleas'd, Statues haue life &amp; moue, Goe new-borne men, and entertaine with loue, These new-borne women, though your number yet Exceedes their's double, they are arm'd with wit, To beare your best encounters, Court them faire: When words and Musicke speake, let none despaire. The Song. [1.] Wooe her, and win her, he that can, Each woman hath two louers, So shee must take and leaue a man, Till time more grace discouers; This doth Ioue to shew that want, Makes beautie most respected; If faire women were more skant, They would be more affected. 2 Courtship and Musicke, suite with loue, They both are workes of passion, Happie is he whose words can moue, Yet sweete notes helpe perswasion. Mixe your words with Musicke then, That they the more may enter; Bold assaults are fit for men, That on strange beauties venture. Promet. Cease, cease your woing strife, see Ioue intends, To fill your number vp, and make all friends, Orpheus, and Eutheus, ioyne your skils once more, And with a Hymne the Dietie implore. The second Inuocation to the tune of the first. Powerfull Ioue, that hast giuen fower, Raise this number but once more, That complete, their numerous feet May aptly in iust measures meet. The other foure statues are transformed into women, in the time of this inuocation. Enth. The number's now complete, thankes be to Ioue, No man needs feare a Riuall in his loue; For, all are sped, and now begins delight, To fill with glorie, this triumphant night. The Maskers hauing euery one entertained his Lady, begin their first new entring dance: after it, while they breath, the time is entertained with a dialogue song. Breath you now, while Io Hymen To the Bride we sing: O how many ioyes, and honors, From this match will spring? Euer firme the league will proue, Where only goodnesse causeth loue. Some for profit seeke What their fancies most disleeke, These loue for vertues sake alone: Beautie and youth vnite them both in one. Chorvs. Liue with thy Bridegroome happy, sacred Bride; How blest is he, that is for loue enui'd. The Maskers second dance. Breath againe, while we with musicke Fill the emptie space: O but do not in your dances, Your selues only grace. Eu'ry one fetch out your Pheare, Whom chiefely you will honor heere, Sights most pleasure breed, When their numbers most exceed: Chuse then, for choice to all is free, Taken or left, none discontent must bee. Chorvs. Now in thy Reuels frolicke-faire delight, To heape Ioy on this euer honored night. The Maskers during this Dialogue take out others to daunce with them, men women, and women men, and first of all the Princely Bridegroome and Bride were drawne into these solemne Reuels, which continued a long space, but in the end were broken off with this short Song. A Song. Cease, cease you Reuels, rest a space, New pleasures presse into this place, Full of beautie and of grace. The whole scÃ¦ne was now againe changed, and became a prospectiue with Porticoes on each side, which seemed to go in a great way, in the middle was erected an Obeliske, all of siluer, and in it lights of seuerall colours, on the side of this Obeliske, standing on Pedestals, were the statues of the Bridegroome and Bride, all of gold in gratious postures. This Obeliske was of that height, that the toppe thereof touched the highest cloudes, and yet Sybilla did draw it forth with a threed of gold. The graue Sage was in a Roabe of gold tuckt vp before to her girdle, a Kirtle gathered full, and of siluer; with a vaile on her head, being bare neckt, and bearing in her hand a screle of Parchment. Eutheus. Make cleare the passage to Sibilla's sight, Who with her Trophee comes, to crowne this night, And as her selfe with Musicke shall be led, So shall shee pull on with a golden thread. A high vast Obeliske, dedicate to fame, Which immortalitie it selfe did frame. Raise high your voices now, like Trumpets fill, The roome with sounds of Triumph, sweete and shrill. A Song. Come triumphing, come with state, Old Sibilla, reuerend Dame, Thou keep'st the secret key of fate, Preuenting swiftest fame. This night breath onely words of ioy, And speake them plaine, now be not coy, Sib. Debetur alto iure, Principium Ioui, Votis det ipse vimmeis, dictis fidem. Vtrin? decoris splendet egregium Iubar, Medio triumphus mole stat dignus sua, CÅlum? summo Capite dilectum petit; Quam pulchra pulchro sponsa respondet viro! Quam plena numinis? Patrem vultu exprimit, Parens futura masculÃ¦ prolis, Parens Regum, imperatorum: Additur GermaniÃ¦ Robur Britannicum. etquid esse par potest? Vtram? iunget vnamens gentem, fides, Dei? Cultus vnus, &amp; simplex amor. Idem erit vtri? hostis, sodalis idem, idem Votum periclitantium, at? eadem maniis. Fauebit illis Pax, fauebit bellica Fortuna, semper aderit Adiutor Deus. Sic, sic Sibilla; vocibus nec his deest Pondus, nec hoc inane monumentum trahit. Et aureum est, &amp; quale nec flammas timet, Nec fulgura, ipsi quippe sacratur Ioui. Pro. The good old Sage is silenc't, her free tongue That made such melodie, is now vnstrung: Then grace her Trophee with a dance triumphant, Where Orpheus is none can fit musick want. A Song and dance triumphant of the Maskers. 1 Dance, dance, and visit now the shadowes of our ioy, All in height, and pleasing state, your changed formes imploy. And as the bird of Ioue salutes, with loftie wing, the morn; So mount, so flie, these Trophees to adorne. Grace them with all the sounds and motions of delight, Since all the earth cannot expresse a louelier sight, View them with triumph, and in shades the truth adore, No pompe or sacrifice can please Ioues greatnesse more. 2 Turne, turne, and honor now the life, these figures beare, Loe, how heau'nly natures farre aboue all art appeare, Let their aspects reuiue in you, the fire that shin'd so late, Still mount and still retaine, your heauenly state. Gods were with dance, and with musick seru'd of old, Those happie daies deriu'd their glorious stile from gold: This pair by Hymen ioyn'd, grace you with measures then, Since they are both diuine, and you are more then men. Orph. Let here Sybilla's Trophee stand, Leade her now by either hand, That shee may approch yet nearer, And the Bride and Bridegroome heare her Blesse them in her natiue tongue, Wherein old prophesies shee sung, Which time to light hath brought: Shee speakes that which Ioue hath taught. Well may he inspire her now, To make a ioyfull and true vow. Syb. Sponsam sponse toro tene pudicam, Sponsum sponsa tene toro pudicum. Non hÃ¦c vnica nox datur beat is, At vos perpetuo hÃ¦c beabit vna Prole multiplici, pari?, amore. LÃ¦ta, ac vera refert Sybilla, ab Ã lto Ipse Iuppiter annuit loquenti. Pro. So be it euer, ioy and peace, And mutuall loue giue you increase, That your posteritie may grow In fame, as long as Seas doe flow. Enth. Liue you long to see your ioyes, In faire Nymphs and Princely Boyes: Breeding like the Garden flowers, Which kinde heau'n drawes with her warme showers. Orph. Enough of blessing, though too much Neuer can be said to such; But night doth wast, and Hymen chides, Kinde to Bridegroomes and to Brides, Then singing the last dance induce, So let good night preuent excuse. The Song. No longer wrong the night Of her HymenÃ¦an right, A thousand Cupids call away, Fearing the approching day, The Cocks alreadie crow, Dance then and goe. The last new Dance of the Maskers, which concludes all with a liuely straine at their going out.</field>
