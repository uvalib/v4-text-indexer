      <field name="fulltext">DON CARLOS; OR, PERSECUTION. A TRAGEDY, IN FIVE ACTS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HENRY RICHARD, LORD HOLLAND, THIS PLAY IS DEDICATED, BY AN AUTHOR WHO WOULD FEAR TO ENCOUNTER THE CORRECTNESS OF HIS JUDGMENT, THE PURITY OF HIS TASTE, AND HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE CUSTOMS OF SPAIN, DID HE NOT, AT THE SAME TIME, HOPE FOR INDULGENCE FROM THE PARTIALITY OF HIS FRIENDSHIP.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. MEN. Philip, King of Spain. Don Carlos. Don Luis De Cordoba. Valdéz, Great Inquisitor. Lucero, an Inquisitor. Osorio, follower of Don Carlos. Three Inquisitors—Officers and Soldiers. WOMEN. The Queen. Donna Leonora De Cordoba. Lady attending on the Queen. Scene—Madrid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —A Room in the Inquisition. Valdéz. Lucero. VALDÉZ. Well met Lucero! we expected you With anxious thoughts; how prospers our new church In proud Granada? LUCERO. Well as could be hoped: It is a youthful plant, and has not yet Struck root into the soil that can withstand A sudden tempest; the accursed race Of Mahomet still cling with barbarous love To their old idol; some eight hundred years Of unbelief have choked the soil with weeds; Their spirit still is proud; each minor bond Of dress, of language, of familiar custom, Links them with force to their unhallowed faith. VALDÉZ. We shall amend these things; in a few years Their Moorish garb shall yield to christian cloaks, Their tongue shall slip into the pure Castilian, Their household customs, all that constitutes A separate race shall be purged out by fire, And penalty of death; enough of this: We have more pressing matter in debate, That needs your counsel. LUCERO. Let me hear the subject. VALDÉZ. 'Tis of the highest; our young prince, Don Carlos, The heir of Spain; you know his forward humour, His disrespectful tones and harsh constructions On our proceedings; we, who should obtain His reverence and his awe, are viewed with mute And sullen disregard. LUCERO. I know it well. VALDÉZ. Had he locked up the malice in his breast, And done no overt act of enmity To the most holy inquisition, time Must in the end have crowned his purposes; And we should have beheld the mighty bulwark On which we stand, the soldiers of the faith, Shaken, perhaps destroyed. LUCERO. Indeed, this fear Hath often weighed upon my mind. VALDÉZ. In mine It fretted into action; thus I reasoned: If I can spur the irritable stuff Of which the prince is made, to act against us, If I can make a cautious enemy Spring from his ambuscade, and show himself An open foe, then may we close in fight And gain the field, while Philip lives and reigns. LUCERO. The path is perilous; what are your means? VALDÉZ. You may remember Leonora, now The wife of Cordoba, the prince's friend. LUCERO. I do. VALDÉZ. This lady early loved the prince: She was brought up at court, and sighed for him, Her first young girlish passion; it was met With carelessness and scorn; she felt the slight: Now for a stranger tale, King Philip's son Almost unconscious to himself, loves her He should not, the fair Queen of Spain.— LUCERO. Elizabeth! VALDÉZ. Even so—and Donna Leonora is The lady of the court, who waits upon her; She hates the queen for being loved of Carlos, She hates Don Carlos that he loves the queen: She is of our observers; now you hold The clue; this lady and her husband urge The prince to show his secret sentiments Of mercy to the Lutheran; and save The victims of our cruelty; some few Of these I suffered to escape from Spain, To fasten on Don Carlos the foul stain Of favouring heresy. LUCERO. It was well done. VALDÉZ. Nay more; By the excitements of Don Luis Cordoba, The prince has seen the Flemish deputies, Who now are at the court to plead the cause Of rebels, but from all men's sight debarred: Don Carlos spoke with them, his tender soul Melted to learn what hardships were endured By these vile heretics; and better still, He meditates a journey into Flanders, With the kind hope, good youth, to reconcile His father's rebels to his father's crown: This journey is a secret; when 'tis known, 'Twill work the king most strangely. LUCERO. Yet Don Luis Was seemingly the prince's friend. VALDÉZ. And so He seemingly is still. LUCERO. What drove him then To aid your projects? VALDÉZ. Is he not our servant? But to unveil the truth, this Cordoba Was placed about the prince when young,—all know Don Carlos then was choleric; he struck In some short fit of passion his attendant; Forgot it, and believed it was forgiven: But this same Cordoba, ignobly framed, Of base low hatreds, and mean coward fears, Has panted ever since for treble vengeance, Yet dares not ask his own right arm to do it, And darkly borrows our assistance. LUCERO. Deep The soundings of the sea on which you sail! And Donna Leonora aids in this? VALDÉZ. The sharpest tool of all; upon the watch To mark the gestures of the queen, and strike Into Don Philip's breast the poisoned dart Of jealousy, she burns to do us service; 'Tis thus that from the dross of human nature Our alchymy extracts the golden ore, And from vile dirt sublimes our wealth. LUCERO. 'Tis well If these your covered mines are safely laid: I fear some counterplot may cause them burst On our own heads; the king is prudent, knowing, And scarcely will be brought to see the guilt Of his own son; or if he fire an instant, Returning tenderness may make their peace And leave us stranded on the shore. VALDÉZ. Fear not; The king has got a demon: 'tis suspicion; Whose senses are refined to pain, whose ears Are stung to madness by a cricket's chirp; Whose jaundiced eyes in every sheep perceive A covert wolf; and, mark you well, Lucero, He who reposes not in confidence That men are somewhat better than they are, Conceives them worse; Philip beside is crazed With love of fame; he does not love his queen, He does not love his country: but he loves To swell his name with their bright attributes: And when he sees his consort and his throne Both menaced, shall he not resist? LUCERO. In truth, You have profoundly weighed these things; I come A stranger to this counsel, and as yet Know little of its bearings; be it yours To guide, and I will follow; but say, father, Think you the prince is deeply struck with passion For his fair step-mother? VALDÉZ. In good truth, no, The prince is in that melancholy mood, The offspring of a young and teeming fancy, That boys call love; but no more like to love, Than the weak lightning of a summer night, That plays upon the horizon's edge, is like To that which issues from the loaded cloud And rives the oak asunder.—'Twas his nurse, Or his old tutor, grey-beard Osma, told him That he should marry the princess of France, As once our treaties ran; his childish brain Has ever since been dreaming of her. LUCERO. Much Know you of human passions, reverend father. VALDÉZ. Man is the only book I read: but why Waste time on speculation? let's begone, And soon the sceptre of imperial Spain Shall be our mortgage: we the real kings And Philip but our deputy.—Away. SCENE II. An Apartment in the King's Palace. Enter King Philip with a letter in his hand, followed by an Officer. PHILIP. Bid Donna Leonora Cordoba Attend us presently: [Exit Officer. Strange words are these! (reading.) “The queen who seems so sad, can smile sometimes: When the king is not in her company, On one who touches the king nearly:” So— This were no other than Don Carlos: he Always had favour in her eyes, but still It was an innocent regard—yet innocent She cannot be who wears the crown of Spain, And is observed of levity—the boy! How have I tended him from infancy To be my age's staff; thinking to rest On him my heavier cares, and curtained schemes Big with the glories of a future age; And now he is a vulture, hovering o'er me, Watching my death to feed on my remains. The people cry: “There is the prince shall reign When Philip is no more:” old nurses bless His beardless face, and silly children toss Their tiny caps into the air; while I Am met by frigid reverence, passive awe, That fears, yet dares not own itself for fear; As though the public hangman stalked behind me. And this it is to reign—to gain men's hate. Thus for the future monarch, Fancy weaves A spotless robe, entwines his sceptre round With flow'ry garlands, places on his head A crown of laurels, while the weary present, Like a stale riddle or a last-year's fashion, Carries no grace with it. Base, vulgar world! 'Tis thus that men for ever live in hope, And he that has done nothing is held forth As capable of all things; poor weak herd! Heaven save me from the breath of their applause! Enter Donna Leonora. PHILIP. Madam, good day. I have desired your presence On urgent matters: answer me, and quick, What is the general temper of the queen When with her women? gay, or sad, or staid? What her diversion? does the prince's presence Make any change in her deportment? LEONORA. Sire! PHILIP. I ask you how the queen receives our son. LEONORA. I know not well to answer. PHILIP. Yet my words Are plain and simple. LEONORA. Sire! indeed— PHILIP. Reply; I must have truth. LEONORA. Then, sire, behold, the truth; Her usual air appears as if she mocked The state she wears; the jewels of the crown But shade her lustre; all the royal pomp Makes her not proud, but sad: the dignity That doth befit Castile, she casts aside, As if it soiled her purity of heart: But if Don Carlos in her presence stands, Then like a statue starting into life, Her cheeks blush deep with rosy streams; her eyes Glow with unusual fires; her arm, her hand, No longer move with languor: all her frame In animated gesture speaks the soul; Though still her timid modesty of mind Tempers with grace the beauty of her mien. PHILIP. She welcomes him? LEONORA. Yes, sire, such welcome gives As when upon the dark blank world the sun Pours forth his beams; when undistinguished space Grows rich with meaning; hill, and lake, and plain Glitter in new-born light, and hail the day:— Such is the queen, when to our quiet hours Don Carlos gives his leisure. PHILIP. It is well; She should rejoice to see our royal son: Say, does he ever speak to her alone? LEONORA. Nay, gracious sire, that were to my reproach: My office here is to attend the queen; Never to leave her presence; and to break That rule, so long as I can hold my station, Were to betray my duty, soil my race: None ever yet, of countrymen, or friends, Or childish playmates of her infancy, Or near relations of your royal blood, Have ever spoken to the queen alone; Nor have I missed a gesture or a word, Or failed, when reason was, to bear the tale Unto your majesty. PHILIP. 'Tis well; 'tis well: Say now—I would know more—I fain would know;— Not that these things which you have told to me Excite a thought unworthy of the queen, Or can the least unhinge my steadfast love And anchored trust in her fidelity.— Far from us all suspicion! but 'tis well That I, the king, should know the slightest sign, The breath of air, or creaking of a door, That passes in my court:—inform me then, Has it been known to you, the prince, our son, Used more familiar gesture to the queen Than does befit his duty—touched her hand? Or— LEONORA. Never, gracious sire, have I beheld Aught but of reverence from our royal prince: With due and subject duty— PHILIP. Tell me, then, Have you observed the queen at any time Bestow a trinket on the prince? or seen The prince make homage of a gift to her? A chain—a riband—any bauble? LEONORA. Sire, Last month upon her birth-day, I remarked Don Carlos gave a necklace to the queen In worship of the day: 'twas rich, well wrought: But never have I seen the queen attired In that fair ornament: the prince received— 'Twas likewise on his birth-day—from the queen A golden clasp to bind his cloak withal: It is the one he wears in daily use, And seems to cherish. PHILIP. Madam, it is well: Such gifts are but the bonds of courtesy, That add civility to kindred ties: (Aside) Yet like I not such tokens always worn: Love oftentimes that dares not lead his march Direct from heart to heart, by such bye-paths Conducts his enterprize; and warm desires That would shrink back from looking on the life, Are yet excited by the fond caress Bestowed on senseless matter.— (To Leonora.) Leonore— Attend the queen with care, allow no hand, Of baser service, to usurp the place You hold in her near confidence: none else To furnish converse for her evening hours, Or gain her friendship by officious zeal Of waiting at her toilet—look to this.— LEONORA. My gracious sire, your will shall be my law. PHILIP. And mind your own communications: keep Within the limits of discretion: speak To none, your relative or dearest friend, Of that which passes in our palace: stay Your tongue upon the threshold of your speech: Weigh all your words: our palace is the state, Our home the Spanish empire: vulgar breath Must not pollute our councils; least of all Should the base multitude presume to know Of our domestic; be in all reserved, In this most secret. LEONORA. Sire, from infancy I learnt to reverence our royal house, And now by long experience I have known With how much awe the king should be obeyed. PHILIP. 'Tis well—you may depart—yet stay a moment: If without forwardness you can lead on The queen to speak of Carlos, in those hours When the locked bosom opens, and the heart, Surcharged with feeling, overflows in speech, Which women and weak men cannot restrain,— You have my leave to speak and listen, but Tell what you learn to us alone: depart. [Exit Leonora. PHILIP. Uneasy, galling, painful, racking doubt! I think I can perceive a something vague And unsubstantial fasten on my fame, That like a damp and pestilential mist Dims the bright surface of my stainless honour— This Leonora too—that she should see, That she should know the king is jealous—no, Not jealous but disturbed for Spain.—Who's there? Enter Officer. OFFICER. My liege, the great inquisitor, Valdéz, Prays for an audience. PHILIP. Admit him straight. Enter Valdéz. PHILIP. Most holy father let me pray your blessing. VALDÉZ. The church prays heaven to bless her faithful son. [Gives him his benediction. PHILIP. And now, what business leads you to our presence? VALDÉZ. Alas, my king, unwelcome, heavy news I bring your majesty. PHILIP. I pray you speak. Our best attention shall be given you. VALDÉZ. Sire, The tale is of that kind the bearer fears To let escape too rudely, lest the blow May strike the hearer down: I do beseech Your majesty to arm yourself in steel, To brace your soul in mail of fortitude; For that which I shall tell is horrible— Black—sudden—unforeseen. PHILIP. Good father, speak: Say, have I ruled in the two hemispheres For twenty years, and never met reverse? Great as our victories, high as our name, Proud as our empire stands above the rest, Heaven yet has not forgotten to chastise, To save our soul from overweening pride; But never were we so puft up with fame, As not to bear the rod with humbleness— Remember you when our great armament Sailed from our shore to conquer and convert England, rebellious to its God? our ships Collected in our ports by years of toil, The mighty preparations of our realm, Our implements of battle, all the pomp Of naval war which vainly had been deemed Invincible, were scattered to the winds; Our lofty expectations sunk for ever, And, worst of all, our bravest chivalry, The hopes of Christendom, the strength of Spain, Shrouded in waves or chained in English dungeons: When this whole bitter draught, this killing potion Was all distilled into one dreadful word And poured at once into my ear—that word No less than Ruin,—showed I then, Valdéz, A weakness unbecoming of a man, A christian, and a king? VALDÉZ. No—sovereign lord, I do remember well on that sad day When all Madrid was tears, and your whole people Seemed like a widowed queen: the messenger Came to your majesty when in the church, You still prayed heaven for good success: the tale Was dreadful, but your royal countenance Took not the print of woe, your voice august Nor fell nor falter'd when, in brief reply, Calmly you said: “I did not send my troops To combat with the elements.” Such proof Of pious resignation swift was known, And half the anguish of the wound was saved By iron constancy: for fortitude Rewards itself, and dries the stream of grief In its own source, the mind. PHILIP. In fortitude Our nation ever was pre-eminent: But most of all it doth become a king, To stand aloof from common sympathies; We have a separate life, the place we hold, We hold from heaven; we should free ourselves From cumbrous trammels of humanity That bind men down to earth: we stand on high, As Muley Hassan One of the peaks of the Sierra Nevada is so called. that o'erlooks the plain Of fair Granada, or those mightier hills Our soldiers speak of, hiding half the sky Of Indian Peru, which view unchanged The change of seasons, whilst the vale below Shows all vicissitude: speak on. VALDÉZ. My king I will proceed, though harsh and crude the tale. We are informed Don Carlos— PHILIP. What of him? VALDÉZ. I grieve to speak of aught that may affect The prince's honour; but my duty bids To represent— PHILIP. Go on— VALDÉZ. Men of proved worth, Whose lives give weight and value to their words, Have sworn to our tribunal that the prince, Don Carlos, gives an ear to heretics; Pities their fate; assists them when they fly From lawful punishment; holds conference With Berg and Montigny, the deputies, Who here within Madrid provoke the wrath Of heaven upon all Spain by laying wide Their nets for falling spirits; all of this Your majesty's own son, the heir of Spain, Promotes and fosters; yet on all of this Our sage tribunal would have cast a veil, And hiding from your eyes a son's defect By gentle remedies restored his mind To its right functions; but of late— PHILIP. Well, well! VALDÉZ. It is affirmed the prince, with headlong haste, Prepares a journey to your Flemish states; And there intends to comfort and assist The rebels to their king and to their God. PHILIP. What proof of this? what witnesses? what plan Of enterprize? 'tis madness this— VALDÉZ. Indeed It seems so; and I hope it may appear Our caution is deceived—although 'tis rare For us to harbour error;—witnesses, Weighty and strong, attest the facts I tell: I come not with the tale of some base wretch, Pitching his quoit for vengeance or for gain, With eye close drawn upon his mark: these facts Have flowed from many sources; pure clear springs Where nothing turbid dwells; their names my oath Forbids me to reveal: the prince's plan We know not fully: that we hear at least, We fain would think a child of fantasy. PHILIP. Speak all you know; I long to hear the worst. VALDÉZ. Such airy stories of projected deeds Cannot affect my royal sovereign's peace That which is grounded I have told— PHILIP. Speak on,— Hold me not in suspense,—speak on, old priest. VALDEZ. Then since your majesty can calmly bear To listen to these black unnatural rumours That shake the ground, and seem beneath our feet To herald earthquakes; it is said and sworn By friends deep in his plans that Spain's young prince Means to leave here his devilish instruments To cut the remnant of his father's life; And then, they say, Don Carlos will return To wed the queen— PHILIP. To wed the queen, thou sayst! (The curse of heaven light upon his head!) [Aside. To wed the queen! a false informer's tale, Coined to mislead your exemplary zeal: For which we give you thanks, you have our thanks For all the love and wakeful vigilance You show in our behalf: but if 'tis false, As by my royal crown I deem it is, You go not free from blame; and mark my words: There are some busy spirits in the world, Whose tempers in the natural food of life Lack aliment, as ships whose sails in calm Flap to and fro, and waste their action; souls Whose order is disturbance; they must find Or make a plot, and should they fail to raise The subject 'gainst the prince, they move the prince To vex the subject: black unnatural treasons Rise at their bidding: spirits, dark as hell, Foul murders, sacrilege, conspiracy Wait at their beck, and instant on their call People the earth with horrors: there are others, Chapmen of human life, whose trade is blood, Who like the vampire live and suck their breath From the stern scaffold, where their comrades' heads Lie bathed in gore—oh, think on this and doubt!— But say the queen—what said you of the queen? VALDÉZ. Nothing my liege; nothing has been deposed That may affect the queen. PHILIP. 'Tis well, Valdéz: For if there had, the villain should have died Who dared to aim his arrows at a star Pure as the heaven she's made for; it is well. VALDÉZ. But for the prince, sire.— PHILIP. For the prince, Valdéz, I will myself take instant cognizance Whence the report has risen; if there be In this grave charge ever so little truth, We need your counsel: but if some vile slave Has coined the calumny to gain our ear, The utmost rigour of the extremest rack Shall tear his limbs; his joints shall agonize Quite to the verge of life; he shall repay The torture that his barbarous treachery Already has inflicted upon me. [Exit. VALDÉZ. Farewell Thou great example of serenity! The hill whose top beholds without a change The change of season: thou, whose mind is free From cumbrous trammels of humanity! These great men of the earth affect a wisdom Their closer life belies, sit wrapt in clouds Of mystery that cheat the distant eye But cannot blunt the near observer's glance. Destroy their people; steadfast as the oak, They bear the tempest: but if touched themselves, In their least joint, by a slight breath of air, They tremble like the reed—oh, magnanimity! But stay! here comes the queen! in haste,—alarmed! Enter Queen. QUEEN. Most holy father, tell me quick, I pray, Why is the king in anger with his son? VALDÉZ. Nay, madam, why imagine you— QUEEN. Just now He passed me with contracted, angry brow, And eye that rolled and threatened: never yet Saw I the king so moved: he passed me by, And calling loud a captain of his guard Bade him confine Don Carlos to his chamber. VALDÉZ. Madam, this is indeed unwelcome news: To me as strange as to your majesty; I dare not guess the cause, but know full well The king acts not without— QUEEN. Father, alas! You will not tell me, nor can I reproach The silence of a faithful counsellor; But I beseech you, since you have a voice In all deliberations of the state, That you will now attune and temper it To soothe the rugged humour of the king. His anger rises, and 'tis perilous When wrath and power combine in one. VALDÉZ. Indeed I would— QUEEN. Say not indeed, say not you would, But be and act the minister of peace. VALDÉZ. Madam, I know not how the prince provokes The king's displeasure. QUEEN. Nay, he is not guilty, Cannot be guilty of a grave offence Against his honoured father and his king: He is too kind, too warm of heart, too just For crime; nor can his clear transparent breast E'er harbour treachery: but attributes That most ennoble men to kindred hearts, Open an easy passage to the base To work their devilish ends: Carlos is hot, Sudden in anger, eager in discourse, His feelings come all struggling to his lips Unmarshalled by the wand of Prudence; hence His enemies catch up a wayward phrase Or thoughtless word, and dress it in a shape That makes it monstrous: such an enemy, I doubt it not, has now informed the king Against his loyalty. VALDÉZ. I trust 'tis so— To undeceive the king were then a task Easy as 'twere delightful: but the affair Is delicate; you know our sovereign's will Bears not with busy meddlers: king and prince Stand in such close relation, 'twere not safe To thrust a stranger's hand between the joints: These obvious arguments arrest my steps, Lest in my eager zeal to serve the prince, I but obstruct his cause; you, madam, stand In other circumstance; a prayer from you Were graceful, not obtrusive; yours the right To show a mother's interest for the prince Without the weakness that to sterner breasts Lessens the value of a mother's plea. QUEEN. Since you advise me thus, I fly to use Such poor persuasion as my baffled thoughts Can well collect. VALDÉZ. May Heaven bless your zeal! [Exit Queen. VALDÉZ. Such intercession opportunely comes, Minist'ring fuel to the fire of rage Which else might soon burn out: the prince's tongue, With frankness oft more strong than eloquence, Reaches the listener's heart, and sways the mind By throwing down it's guards: suspicion's self Dares to suspect no more: 'twere dangerous For Philip and his son to meet: I go To lay new mines that underneath their feet Shall spread unseen, and unexpected burst.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —Apartment of Don Carlos. DON CARLOS. Too cruel fortune! was it then in sport You smiled upon my dawn of enterprise, To drive me back when with my swelling sails I touched the port? Unhappy prince of Spain! I must not rule—to rule means to destroy— To persecute—away such rule from me! I must not love—that soft and gentle mood To me implies things horrible of thought. And now I must not fly: condemned to live, And stand a mark for fortune's archery. Yet come what will, my breast shall be prepared To suffer all things; let me banish hope And think the worst: a mortal frame can bear But some few hours of anguish, and the life Escapes to freedom; 'tis comparison With thoughts of past, or dreams of future bliss, That gives to misery its point and venom— My Cordoba! Enter Cordoba. CORDOBA. My prince! what mean these sentinels That guard your door? CARLOS. I know no more than this, The king has so commanded; 'tis not long— But a few minutes, since the officer Who keeps the guard here in the palace came In haste to make me prisoner; he said The king with his own voice gave out the order. CORDOBA. 'Tis strange! no cause assigned; so suddenly; What are your plans? how think you to defeat This unforeseen arrest? CARLOS. I have no plan. CORDOBA. Such a reply but ill becomes a prince. CARLOS. My faculties but ill become a prince: Our mother Nature with a strange caprice Fits us for other parts than those we play: A priestly robe covers the brawny limbs And lion-heart that should have been a soldier's; While many a delicate fibre that seems formed To be for ever wrapt in silken bonds Is torn by peasant toil, or wastes itself Beneath the scorching Phœbus, or night-storm, In guarding camps: I, even I, was framed To wander idly all the day in woods, To gather flowers, to feed on the wild grape, To drink the natural spring, to list to birds, And find my joy in breathing balmy air— I was not made for courts or camps. CORDOBA. Yet still You think of public weal, and even now You were embarking in a public cause: Had you preferred an idle shepherd's life, Methinks Don Philip would have spared his guards. CARLOS. See you, Don Luis, no distinction then Between a choice of lot, and bearing ill What is already chosen? I stand here Prince of Asturias, the heir of Spain: To leave the mighty interests of mankind To follow nightingales, would be in me Consummate baseness, treason to my state, Cruel injustice to collected millions, The people of two hemispheres, who own The Spanish rule, and on some future day, Which Heaven long avert! will take their hue Of joy or sorrow from my smile or frown. O'erwhelming thought! would it were otherwise. CORDOBA. Nay, say not so. CARLOS. I mean it, Cordoba; The impending weight oppresses me; I fain Would throw it off, but Heaven stands betwixt, And with unchanging voice bids me assume The appointed burden. Thus I stand prepared: But when without control of mine, a light Points out a way by which I may escape, Although the door be death, I feel the joy Of a freed galley-slave, who bursts his chains, And kisses his dear native land once more. CORDOBA. Yet there is more in this—Don Carlos—Prince— Your grief, 'tis clear, has deeper causes. CARLOS. Hold! CORDOBA. Nay, let me speak, a follower and a friend, Most loving, ready to lay down my life In your behalf; I do adjure you, say, Is there not some disease upon your heart, That grows and festers there? CARLOS. Alas, my friend! CORDOBA. If I have any skill in marks of passion, You have a secret love. CARLOS. Ah! speak it not. CORDOBA. Yet why this shudder? Love is a bright flame That consecrates the altar where it falls, And vivifies our clay. CARLOS. Alas, not mine! CORDOBA. 'Tis strange this passion—who then can— CARLOS. Oh, spare! CORDOBA. Nay, give your feelings vent. CARLOS. Oh agony! If thou couldst feel the pangs that rack my heart, The inward struggles and the vain resolves, The contests oft renewed, that seem to give A victory to virtue, but exhaust My feeble being; then the demon comes, And seizes on my weakness unopposed.— Again a wild and horrible remorse Provokes me to fresh effort, and again I combat, conquer, tremble, suffer, sink. Oh! had the idol of my heart been scornful, Rejected all my prayers, spurned at my love, And met my adoration with contempt, I could have borne it; then indeed, methinks, The simple recollection of her form, The faintest image of a smile gone by, The feeling of a moment, fled away, And fled for ever, were to me a feast That India could not buy—my life—my all.— But viewing her perfections with my eyes, To be obliged to chase her from my thought, To view myself with loathing—the rank soil In which a poison grows!—no—I'll no more— The very speaking it is horrible. These dreadful images I hoped to quell By flying far from Spain;—in other lands I might have rested in calm misery, My farthest hope, what other mortals fear, A disappointed, withered love. CORDOBA. But say What object thus has— CARLOS. Villain—speak it not— I have betrayed myself; my present trouble Has made a fracture in my mind; its thoughts Flow out unchecked; but heed them not, Don Luis: I did but rave—and yet, my friend, believe My heart is innocent: my pliant youth Was taught as duty what is now my crime: I saw her, was betrothed to her, and— CORDOBA. Hush! Enter King Philip. PHILIP. (waving his hand to Cordoba.) Retire. [Exit Cordoba. PHILIP. —Don Carlos, 'tis with heavy grief The safety of the state has forced me thus To place a guard upon your sacred person: Your highness has been charged with crimes— CARLOS. Who dares Impeach my honour? who— PHILIP. Softly, my son— I came not to accuse; yet were I not Your father, and see in your lineaments Myself renewed, I might have stood aloof, And bid blind Justice do her office: now I come with friendly and paternal care To heal, not punish: listen to my words. It may be that my royal power and state Have waked aspiring thoughts within your breast, And like a gallant courser seeing the speed At which his fellow flies, you chafe and fret, In dull inaction curbed. CARLOS. By Heaven, not so. PHILIP. Nay, interrupt me not. If it be thus, Ill do you know the spectral forms that wait Upon a king; Care with his furrowed brow, Unsleeping Watchfulness, lone Secrecy, Attend his throne by day, his couch by night: He stands the guardian of a beacon tower; If storms arise, they rage around his head; If lightnings fall, they strike upon his roof; And in the gladness of a summer day, As in the tempest of a winter night, He walks apart, companionless, to watch If 'gainst the common-weal a foe appear, And call the world to arms. CARLOS. Oh! far from me Is lust of that sad power: I hate it all. PHILIP. If truly, 'tis with reason; our vain pomp Gives but a hollow joy and lasting grief; 'Tis for our subjects' honour not for ours. The garlands and the gold that deck the bull, Denote the sacrificing people's pride, And not the victim's fortune. CARLOS. I know not What means your majesty. PHILIP. Listen, Don Carlos! Your honoured grandsire, when a manly beard Scarce plumed his cheek, rose to a height of power Such as the world for ages had not seen; Castile and Arragon, long separate, Became compact beneath his happy sway; Granada, late a strength of infidels, Lay bowed beneath his yoke; in Germany The imperial crown was placed upon his head, While to his vacant treasury a new world Across the ocean wafted tides of gold, Won by the valour of his officers, Who in their conquests were as mighty kings, And in fidelity obedient subjects. America for him unlocked her mines; Asia for him produced her balmy spice; Africa saw, and trembled at his arms; Europe was one vast echo to his fame:— Yet he, thus glorious, when his term of years Betokened wisdom, (far from doting age, When sense grows torpid,) saturate of power, Aspired to private life, and humble rest. So now do I: fatigued with slavery, Miscalled command, I purpose to resign My kingdom to your hands, reserving only The isle of Sicily, where with my queen I may conclude in peace a stormy life. CARLOS. Nay, king, my father, speak not so, I pray, I feel my heart so full, I cannot utter The thoughts which crowd my mind—I have not been, Nor ever will, a traitor—am not fit To fill the throne though it were vacant, now 'Tis filled most worthily—none ever grasped The sceptre with such majesty, or made Obedience seem so due, so natural, As my most honoured king and dearest father. PHILIP. You do not wish to take it from me then? CARLOS. Not I, by Heaven; here upon my knees I pray for your long reign. PHILIP. He is sincere: This stratagem does well. [Aside. CARLOS. I cannot speak All that I should; how little I deserve So kind, so good a father! thanks! and thanks! PHILIP. He is too warm for guilt, and yet, methinks, Too grateful for a perfect innocence. [Aside. Thou art deserving of my love, my wish Is to meet yours, speak then if there is aught Thou hast desired and feared to ask. CARLOS. My heart Will break with so much kindness: father, king, Here I confess my fault—nay, do not start As if I were a villain; never thought Of harm to thee or to thy crown has found Admission in my breast. PHILIP. How then? what fault? What strange offence?— CARLOS. The tale is long to tell, But, with your pleasure, my whole mind and soul, As it affects your state, shall be unrolled. PHILIP. Give me your utmost confidence—proceed! CARLOS. I do remember well—too well, alas, My age but scarce fourteen, your royal self Absent in Flanders, I was bid preside At the great Act of Faith to be performed In fair Valládolid: at that green age Quite new to life, nor yet aware of death, The solemn pomp amused my careless mind. But when the dismal tragedy began, How were my feelings changed and clouded! first Came there a skeleton, upon its head A cap with painted flames; this thing had been A lady who throughout her life had borne A name unsullied; twenty years had past Since her remains had rested in the ground, And now by sentence of the Holy Office, The dull disgusting mass of whitened bone That once had been her garment, was dug up To clear some flaw in her theology: Then came a learned priest, his name Cazalla; With countenance serene, and calm devotion, He walked to death, and as he passed me by, With earnest manner he entreated me For his poor sister's offspring; she condemned To prison for her life, and loss of goods, While twelve unhappy children were bereft Of parents and of food; I wept, and thought Of the poor orphans. PHILIP. You should have rejoiced To think so many infant souls were saved Perversion. CARLOS. How! rejoice! not to have wept Were then impossible; I sobbed for pity. But soon a sterner sight braced up my nerves, Rigid with horror, for the murderous pile Was lighted for the sacrifice: unmoved, The Great Inquisitor beheld his victims. Cazalla too was undisturbed: the mind Might fairly doubt which of the two were judge, And which the culprit, save that gleams of joy Like one who sees his haven, spread their light Upon Cazalla's face. The flames burst forth, And with slow torture singed the limbs of him, Who seemed alone amid the multitude To be unconscious of this earthly hell. But as we looked amazed, sudden he rushed From forth the flames, and while by-standers fled In sudden panic, bore from off a heap Fresh store of wood, upbraiding the weak wretch Who stood beside it; this he flung amain Upon the pile, and raising high his voice Exclaimed “Farewell! thou sinful world, farewell! Ye—earth, and sun, and moon, and stars, farewell! Welcome my God! welcome eternal life!” PHILIP. Blasphemous error!—could this heretic Have hope of heaven? CARLOS. Such was his belief; Perhaps mistaken. PHILIP. Prince, did I hear you right? Perhaps mistaken? CARLOS. Patience a little while; You shall know all my thoughts. Cazalla, he That stood so tall before me in the strength Of a high soul, was now a cinder, tost And scattered by the air: but there was more Of this too dreadful pageant; I beheld Fourteen of our poor brethren suffer death From Cain's descendants. PHILIP. Peace, prince! CARLOS. I have done My narrative, but that I should have told That ere the hecatomb began, Valdéz, As Great Inquisitor, tendered an oath Which I unwilling took: I thereby swore If ever I should see, or hear, or know By any means, of aught concerned the faith, Of friend or stranger, parent, brother, son, I should reveal the same without delay Unto the holy office; that dark oath I took, but thanks to heaven, I broke. PHILIP. You broke! CARLOS. More than a thousand times: the horrid glare Of that dread sacrifice fell on my mind And drove the senses from my brain; my thought Hung on the place where virtue had been slain, Where I had been a chief of murderers. Long while I suffered; still by day and night The features of Cazalla, old and grey, With mildness-mingling somewhat of reproach, Haunted my couch, nor could I gain relief Till I sought out the wretched seats of those Who err in faith and feel themselves impelled To seek for heaven by martyrdom on earth. PHILIP. You sought them out! you should have hated them. CARLOS. Many of these I have assisted, bade Them fly this perilous air of Spain, conversed With several of their leaders, viewed their lives, Pure as the light; their faith still steadfast worshipped Christ and the book of life. Forgive me, father, I could not, can not, will not hate these men. PHILIP. You hate them not—you, prince of Spain! CARLOS. Alas! I know how scruples of this hue offend The eyes of Spanish rulers; I have weighed Each separate argument, conned one by one The reasons that our church puts forth to spur Her sons to persecution. PHILIP. Call it not By that unworthy name, nor is it fit A child like you should mount the judgment-seat To censure policy which Spain has deemed The way of health, by sages pointed out To Ferdinand the Catholic—approved By counsellors grown grey in the state's service, By saints and martyrs of our holy church, By the pope's wise decree infallible, In fine by God himself. CARLOS. That I deny. PHILIP. Don Carlos, hold your peace. CARLOS. King, I have drunk The stream of revelation at its source: That book, to common eyes denied, to me By Osma's reverend bishop, my preceptor, Was early given; best and dearest gift That man can give to man, becoming thus The minister of God, and angel-like Carrying glad tidings to the immortal soul: There have I read, assisted by the lore Of my dear master; there too have I read Alone and unassisted, late at night, And early in the morning, words of peace, Forgiveness ev'n for sin; brotherly love, And charity that beareth, hopeth all; I found and wept with joy; but to this hour Find I no precept that commissions man To slay his erring brother. PHILIP. Prince, beware: Dread my displeasure. CARLOS. I dread heaven's more; And strongly armed with truth, I dare proclaim The inquisition murderous tyrant. PHILIP. Peace, Thou bold blasphemer! most unworthy thou To fill the throne, or even to tread the soil Of christian Spain. CARLOS. Of persecuting priests! I know my own unfitness, every act Of rigour draws fresh tears into my eyes, And therefore purposed I to fly from Spain To seek in Flanders a secure retreat, And there lie hidden; willing to forego The mighty sceptre of imperial Spain, My bright inheritance, unless repentant The Spanish people should one day admit Their king might reign unstained with righteous blood. PHILIP. What rebel purpose is it you disclose? CARLOS. No rebel purpose, sire; for whilst you live No son to father, subject to his king, Should pass me in obedience. PHILIP. Tell me then What think you of our war in Flanders? say, Shall not the traitor suffer for his treason? Is't not legitimate to take up arms That rebel heretics may be subdued? CARLOS. Yet kindness were more politic than force: Grant them their privilege, your royal grace To worship God in their own simple form, Rebellion's hydra head will straight be crushed, Or of itself fall off. PHILIP. I'll hear no more: Prince, look not for indulgence: duty, nay, Affection bids that I should be severe; And I will be so. [Exit. CARLOS. (solus.) Welcome then severe But unjust fate!—How now! Osorio here! My good, my faithful friend! Enter Osorio. OSORIO. Your faithful servant: I have obeyed your highness's commands, And at this instant reach Madrid. CARLOS. All thanks! Yet in your absence Envy's cruel blight Has spoilt our harvest; yet speak on. What news? OSORIO. Following your orders, when I parted hence, I straight repaired to Burgos; there I saw The count of Salvatierra. CARLOS. What said he? OSORIO. He thanked your highness for your kind remembrance; Felt for your trouble, but the present time Found him quite unprovided with the sums You wanted for your expedition. CARLOS. So— OSORIO. I next sought Infantado; he too joined In many loving speeches; but he feared He was too closely watched to dare give proof Of his unbated friendship. CARLOS. Friends of sunshine! And Fuentes, and Toledo, and the count Of Benevente. OSORIO. All, not excepting one Have sent excuses: here, in a little book I have their several reasons in set terms. CARLOS. Spare me the mockery. And so from all My train of friends, all full of homage too, All wishing to be served, but loath to serve, You have not drawn one small maravedí? OSORIO. 'Tis so, indeed; yet think not, gracious prince, I come back empty. CARLOS. What, Saavedra, then! OSORIO. Nor Saavedra, no, nor any other Of your proud lofty friends, the dons of Spain, Have filled my purse; but by good chance a Jew, With whom I lodged at Seville, knowing me Your servant, offered, nay entreated, prayed, That I would borrow twenty thousand dollars, To buy you laces; begging me withal That when your highness should put on your crown, He might have some indulgence granted him, And leave to say his prayers on Saturdays. At first I played the prude, and feigned some rage He should so hurt your dignity; but soon The coin with amorous chinking won my ear, And I was fain to be persuaded. CARLOS. Well: You make me smile in spite of fate. OSORIO. There's more— Ounces, gold ounces, that with hook and line I fished from merchants' pockets; but of this Hereafter: the time presses, and I haste To tell what I have heard a moment gone, From a familiar of the holy office, Busied in preparations, that he deems Threaten a lofty head. CARLOS. How? is it so? Enter with me, Osorio; we will speak Of these same tidings in my inner chamber. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Another Room. Enter Queen and Leonora. QUEEN. Come, Leonora. LEONORA. Madam, I am here, But know not where you go, or what you seek: The king will pass this way. QUEEN. 'Tis well; he comes. Enter Philip. PHILIP. Madam, I marvel what kind star has led Your steps this way, to brighten with your presence Our dull abode. QUEEN. Sire, I have ventured here, To move your majesty on an affair Of urgent moment. PHILIP. (to Leonora.) Leave us, then, madam. [Exit Leonora. PHILIP. I am your listener. QUEEN. Sire, alas! my tongue Is but a feeble organ to express That which a heart less simple would array In robes of eloquence. I am no orator; But if I were, with what persuasive tones, With what resistless reason would I seek Your mercy, if your mercy he requires, In favour of Don Carlos. PHILIP. Is it so? [Aside. Madam, you show your charity in this; A female heart we know is soft and kind: And yet, methinks, a step-mother might leave The prince's pardon to his father's love! QUEEN. Nay, look not sternly on my prayer; I speak Because I am a step-mother, and thus No soil of interest or partial hue Can colour my abatement of his fault. PHILIP. Madam, you speak it well: but this affair Concerns the state, whose fabric I must guard As sentinel; no bribe, no weak affection, No woman's tear must draw me from the post Where God has placed me for my people's good: Speak then, if you have aught on his behalf, In the calm key of reason; though indeed I cannot well perceive whence you should draw Your knowledge, or your argument. QUEEN. I own If it be requisite to sound the depths Of law, or policy, none more unfit Than she who stands before you to devise Strains of state reasoning; and yet I feel, I think Don Carlos innocent. PHILIP. Indeed! You think him innocent; nay then, I wait To hear your argument. QUEEN. Alas, my lord! You strike me cold with apprehension. yet— (Aside.) Courage my heart! (aloud) Sire, of the prince I speak, As I have seen him, easily inflamed, And catching fire in every generous cause; Suffering with every sufferer; sharing loss With every loser in the game of life; A soul ennobled by companionship With lofty thoughts, and mighty purposes; Hating all wrong, and scourging with a rod Of scorn contemptuous the sloth of vice; Yet with proud bearing throwing back the praise, Our courtiers trade in for their private gain; This sternness makes him enemies, but still His heart is to his duty rivetted; Nor lives there of your subject millions, one Whom malice with more rancour would accuse, Or virtue with more confidence defend. PHILIP. Madam, the arguments you urge, shall pass Into the balance of impartial justice, And tell for what they weigh: but hear my words, Elizabeth of France; the poorest, worst, Most wretched hovel in the realm of Spain, Hides not a crime that trenches on our state; For we have eyes that search the land, and mark The guilty spot; then cherish not the thought That our own palace can in secret corners Engender plots we see not; all, yes all, We know them all. QUEEN. Unquestioned, sire, by me Your wisdom or your power. PHILIP. Not one whit less Our justice, queen— QUEEN. I doubt it not, and pray To heaven to bless your councils. PHILIP. Learn ye then In silence to respect them; one word more; Remember, lady, you are Cæsar's wife— [She beckons to speak. We fain would be alone—farewell—farewell. [Exit Queen. PHILIP. How do a thousand furies tear my breast, And strive for mastery!—am I Philip still? I that have stood so eminent, the king, The only king of Europe who enjoyed That which a king should have—unfettered power, Unlimited discretion:—have I toiled For fame of subtle wisdom, blanched the cheeks Of infidels and heretics, the enemy Of all God's enemies, now to become The sport of my own child, seeing my work Destroyed by baby hands; my very queen Transfer her pledged affections to my boy, And come herself unconsciously to tell The maddening tale to me! how sharp a jest For Turkish slaves and English mobs were I If they could say: “He vexed the world with arms To put down heresy; guarded his states With triple barriers to preserve them pure From all contagion, but he warmed the while A viper in his bosom, his own son, Who wrenched the royal sceptre from his hand And bore away his consort from his side! Thus has he lost the gorgeous heritage Wise Ferdinand, and mighty Charles acquired!” Now could I plunge my dagger in thy breast— And have revenge—my own—my sole—last hope— 'Twere just—'twere memorable vengeance—yet Such deeds become not Philip—Spain, the world Would stamp the deed with execration—still Revenge I must and will obtain: Valdéz, And his dark troop shall be my instruments; They shall pursue my purpose as their own; Thus wise men plan what busy men perform!

LEONORA. I have: A veil of secrecy conceals Don Carlos From common eyes; but by a faithful friend, I learn that even now the prince has pass'd By subterranean paths into the palace Of the inquisition. QUEEN. The inquisition! ah— What dangers menace him? what cruel fate Hangs over him? what may betide the prince? What augurest thou? think'st thou he shall escape? How calm thou art! how tranquilly thou look'st! Art thou not moved? LEONORA. Madam, it is my duty To give my pity to the prince, but keep My reverence for his father. QUEEN. Duty say'st thou? And when a gallant life, by envious fate, May in a moment have its thread divided, Is duty quite sufficient? LEONORA. Gracious queen, Is it quite safe to feel more than our duty? QUEEN. Well—any way you please—yet even duty Bids us feel sympathy for Carlos. LEONORA. Aye, But with propriety. QUEEN. Thou mak'st me wild With these strange speeches: my good Leonora, My mind is troubled with this news, do thou Who art so calm, suggest some means, some hopes Of safety for the prince. LEONORA. With your leave, madam, I'll hasten to the inquisition; some Of those who serve the court are of my friends, And if good fortune should throw one of these Across my path, I then may learn some tidings To bear your majesty; although indeed 'Tis death to tell or to convey a tale Touching the prisoners of the holy office: These dangers I will brave; I may seem cold, But I am faithful.— QUEEN. Nay, I doubt it not; Thanks, kindest Leonora; haste, away, And execute thy honest purposes. [Exit Leonora. Poor Carlos! brave and gentle-hearted prince, How little equal is thy generous mind To strive with subtle malice—ha 'tis well— (To the Lady.) Go, Donna Beatrix, to the lower court, Where Osma's holy bishop dwells, desire That he attend me straight, without delay, In my own cabinet—haste, Beatrix. [Exeunt different ways. SCENE II. Valdéz, Lucero, and three other Inquisitors discovered sitting in the Hall of the Inquisition. Officers attending. VALDÉZ. Is all prepared? (the rest bow) bring in the prince, Don Carlos. [Exeunt Officers. Lucero, sit near me; I need your counsel. Most holy fathers, pray for our good issue; The fate of Spain hangs upon our resolve; Her palace and her altars that seem fixed So deeply and so cunningly; her peace, Her glory, nay the holy church herself, Shaken in Germany, assailed in France, In England rent and ruined, this day stands In peril of a total overthrow In this her chosen land of refuge; nay, Start not alarmed, but nerve your hearts, good fathers, For if they sink this day, religion sinks; If they are firm, hell shall not ope its gates To unborn millions that were else its prey. LUCERO. Proceed, most holy father, at your voice We are ourselves, and follow to the fight. VALDÉZ. Will you cast off all shrinking compromise Of worldly hopes, with heavenly ordinance? All mean respects, all ancient prejudice, All timid sensibility, and serve The great, eternal, universal cause To which your souls are pledged? are ye resolved? ALL. We are. VALDÉZ. Then I accept the glorious mission, And here, on this exposed pre-eminence, I brave all chances, risk my certain fortune, Station, regard of safety, freedom, life, All that I am and may be, to devote Body and mind to peril, pain, and duty. LUCERO. Such likewise our resolve. SECOND INQUISITOR. Doubt not our zeal. Enter Don Carlos guarded. VALDÉZ. You are the prince. CARLOS. You know me. VALDÉZ. Speak, Lucero. LUCERO. Don Carlos, prince of the Asturias, Knight of the orders of Alcantara And Calatrava, you are summoned here By the great council and supreme tribunal Of inquisition into faith: through me They solemnly adjure you to declare If you have seen, or heard, or act or speech That was, or seemed injurious to the faith, Or privileges of this holy office? (No answer.) Don Carlos, prince of the Asturias, The inquisition bids you to declare, If you have seen, or heard, or act or speech That was, or seemed injurious to the faith, Or privileges of this holy office? VALDEZ. The prince replies not. Let your highness pause And give a moment's thought before you thus Contemn the sacred council, when again I shall interrogate: know then that thus Commences every process in our court, Which in its mercy swerves from rules of law And does not hold its prisoners accused Till they themselves are heard: if they relate All that they know with candour, it may be That farther process stops, at least their plea Is favourably heard; but if elate In carnal pride they scorn our graciousness, We have the means that can extort the truth From rebel lips: excuse me, mighty prince, If in the terms I use I more respect Your interests than your titles: once again We solemnly adjure you to disclose If you have seen, or heard, or act or speech That was or seemed injurious to the faith, Or to this holy inquisition's rights? CARLOS. I do not thank you for your courtesy, I do not fear you for your threats, Valdéz; And for the matter of your question, I Will question you again—is it from mercy You seek to worm from those your power confines Secrets by which their thread of life depends? Do you entrap your fellow-men like foxes And kill them unawares? why question else Him you accuse? I will not answer you. VALDÉZ. Be it so—if in our ministerial acts We meet reproach, my brethren, we must bear All for the sake of heaven.—On, Lucero! Against our will we must become accusers; Read our proceedings. LUCERO. (reading.) “The supreme tribunal Having received from various sources, hints That implicate,”— CARLOS. “From various sources—hints”— Whence came these hints? who was the man that dared Assail my good name thus? VALDÉZ. We sit not, prince, To answer questions; but to seek the truth, For purposes of fair and equal justice; Yet, if the court permits me, I apprise you These informations were anonymous. CARLOS. Just, true, and equal judges! it is thus You have depressed all worth and honesty To crown mean private hatreds, base revenge And calumny; these raise their serpent heads, And make a Lybian desert of the land. VALDÉZ. Your wit somewhat outstrips your judgment, prince, One instant more of patience, (though indeed Your rank contemns that virtue of the poor,) You would have heard that these suggestions led To other perquisitions; had this court On better inquest found your highness clear, Your fame had never been impeached: these walls Transmit no sound to the external world.— Unhappily—but you shall hear.—Read on. CARLOS. I am your victim—I care not to hear How you may gloss your purpose.—Read the sentence. VALDÉZ. Again I must entreat your patience:—prince, You wrong our court: you have too well imbibed The falsehoods that the infidel contrives To blast our fame: but since you wish us brief;— You have to learn then that by good report Of faithful christian persons, certain acts And words were testified against you; these Referred to the high court of qualifiers, Have been pronounced by them heretical, Depraved, and dangerous: now, if you will, Lucero shall declare to you the terms In which these several witnesses have spoken. CARLOS. I am content. LUCERO. (reads.) “The final depositions:— Witness the first declares the prince Don Carlos Hath several times avowed to the deponent He scrupled at the death of heretics: That when he heard of forty Lutherans burnt At the late Act of Faith he wept and spoke In bitter phrase of this most holy office:” So says this witness— VALDÉZ. Prince, what say you? CARLOS. On! LUCERO. The second witness speaks at greater length Of several discourses, when the prince Excused the blasphemy of Luther. CARLOS. Said The witness not I held his doctrine false? VALDÉZ. That is not now the matter in debate; All that a witness states that does not bear A hue of criminality is struck From out our minutes. CARLOS. That, I must presume, Is part of your pure justice.—On Lucero. LUCERO. “Spoke At sundry times of plans for the relief And ease of the self-styled reformed; conferred With Berg and Montigny, the deputies, Respecting terms on which the Flemish soil Should be delivered, as he termed it, from The inquisition: various interviews Were held between the prince and Montigny, Whereby that obstinate rebellious lord Gained strength and vigour in his impious treason Against his God and king: nay more, of late His highness had so fallen from his duty, As to resolve a secret enterprise To Flanders; many preparations spoke His purpose settled, and a trusty servant Went to Madrid to gather from all hands, Pure and impure, the means by which the prince Was to make good his flight: the time was fixed Two days from hence.” VALDÉZ. What says your highness now? There is much more of this. CARLOS. Go on, Lucero. Waste not the time, but let me hear the pith— 'Tis a well-fancied labyrinth. LUCERO. “The third Deposes that the prince impenitent, Avowed his conscience stained with perjury; Acknowledged he had broken the great oath Sworn before thousands at Valladolid; That he had comforted the church's rebels; That he had studied deep the holy bible, And found no precept that commissions man To slay his erring brother: he confessed At full the project of a flight to Flanders.” LUCERO. What says your highness? CARLOS. Nothing. LUCERO. Is this charge A true one? must this court indeed believe Your highness guilty? I hope not—but then You must disprove the accusation. CARLOS. First Let your staunch blood-hounds prove it—I'll not answer Till I perceive the hand that strikes. Your witnesses May be the foul creations of your brain. Are they of flesh? Who is the man, I ask, Assails my good name thus? VALDÉZ. Think not, my prince, Our usages compel us to betray Those who have served us to the vengeful sword Of criminals. CARLOS. Of criminals? not thus Should I be honoured by my father's subjects: You goad me like a bull upon the stage, Provoking me to combat for a life I cannot save; ye would inflame my rage Till I rush on, and seek myself the death To which I am foredoomed: it is your sport— Oh! for an hour of patience. VALDÉZ. Prince of Spain, You have tried ours. Not thus have we been wont To hear ourselves accused from our own bar. Had any other said what you have said, Had any other thus refused to give Answers to our tribunal, he would prove How sharply pain may check philosophy, And humble stoic pride: the rack ere now Had wrung his limbs. CARLOS. Alas! VALDÉZ. Fear not, Don Carlos, Such torments touch you not. CARLOS. Nor for myself Breathed I that sigh, but for the hapless victims Of your fell tyranny. VALDÉZ. For you at least Our tyranny relaxes: solemn rules Of judgment shall give way: the court allows That which no prisoner e'er yet enjoyed, That you should see the witnesses; refute From their own mouths, if that be possible, The weighty charges you have heard. CARLOS. Appear, Wolves! LUCERO. Donna Leonora Cordoba, Come into court. [She appears from the side. CARLOS. Poor fallen instrument Of bad designs; oh, could thy husband see thee, How would he feel! LUCERO. Don Luis Cordoba, Come into court. [He enters from the side. CARLOS. Luis! drop out my eyes! Sink from my eye-balls; ye have seen a sight That makes all future vision horrible! This man I deemed a friend: oh, hollow world! VALDÉZ. There is another witness still, my prince: Lucero, speak. LUCERO. Don Philip, king of Spain, Come into court. [King Philip enters from the side. CARLOS. My father! [Sinks into a chair. VALDÉZ. These, my prince, These are the witnesses, no airy phantoms, Created by our malice; no base tools Of priestly persecution: witness heaven, If we had found that it were possible To shut our ears, that any way were left To disbelieve or slight the testimony That weighs upon your head; with eager joy We had embraced such hope, and closed the abyss That yawns so fearfully: 'tis otherwise: Not ours the blame: yet may our charity, Presuming still the best, cherish the hope You can explain these things: the hours you ask Shall be allowed for preparation; then Our court shall be assembled, hear at full Your highness's prepared defence, and judge As truth, and the great cause of christian Spain, Shall best direct us. Guards, attend the prince To his appointed cell. DON CARLOS. (rising.) Stand off, ye slaves Of wicked masters! I ask no delay: I'll go to trial now; for my defence Is brief and hopeless: I avow it all! All that your witnesses have sworn, I swear, And pledge my honour for its truth: think not That I will stoop or crouch beneath your feet, Unsay my words, and creep away dishonoured: What I have done I own, that I have spoken I speak again; yet I deny my guilt; All that I did was innocent. VALDÉZ. Beware How you proceed; the ground on which you tread Covers the embers of eternal fire. CARLOS. I reck not what ye say: I tell you plainly I pity heretics, and deem your acts Cruel and impious. By what right, I ask, Stand ye 'twixt God and man, restricting thus The uncontrollable and sacred conscience, By your Procrustian bed? VALDÉZ. I grieve to find The heir of Spain so ignorant: know then, We hold the scales for the eternal church, Whose faith is truth; whose empire is the soul Of lost mankind: it is our sacred duty To save our brethren from the treacherous lights That lead to hell who follows. CARLOS. Every church Throughout the world may claim like obligation: Each is for truth; the Turk, the Lutheran, The Calvinist, the Greek, the Indian Brahmin, Proclaims his dogma true: can all be so? If each may persecute, shall not the world Be speckled with one truth, and many errors? VALDÉZ. This smells of heresy: Don Carlos then Doubts our religion true? CARLOS. I doubt it not: 'Tis ye who, by the bloody means ye use, Betray your want of faith: Shall not the God, Who sent his word with miracles and signs To the benighted world, make it prevail Without these chains, this rack, these gloomy dungeons? VALDÉZ. Yet by such means the holy soil of Spain Is from the common stain of Europe free; And erring minds are from their wandering path Reclaimed by our laborious ministry. CARLOS. 'Tis false: the victims that ye sacrifice Are but incensed by your inhuman tortures: Souls of immortal men acquire new strength, New temper, from the fire of persecution; And future ages shall avow the truth, That, in the warfare of contending creeds, The martyr's blood waters the victor's palm. VALDÉZ. Yet many have renounced their new-sprung faith.— CARLOS. Believe them not: their faith is nothing worth: A forced conversion is a forced deceit: We may grow rich by arts that we detest; We may be cured by medicines that we loathe; But by a worship that the soul abhors We never can be saved: 'tis mockery all. Of timid men ye may make hypocrites, Of zealous men ye may make martyrs; but Of none shall ye make Catholics: the faith Of an all-powerful Benevolence Thrives not by blood, nor is it given to spread The charity of Christ by homicide. VALDÉZ. Prince, you speak boldly:—it befits your rank; Yet know that we have full authority To punish unbelievers, and pluck out The tares that grow among the wheat. Beware! CARLOS. Authority? from whom?—is it from Heaven? Has God then put his balance in your hands, Trusted his sword of justice to your arm, That thus ye would usurp his office? Christ Told him alone to judge who had not sinned. Have ye not sinned?—but be it ye have not, Say, will you stake your souls you cannot err? Or left He upon all the common sin That stains the heart, and yet from some erased The common blindness that infirms the head? I am myself a member of your church; I hold her doctrines, follow her commands; Yet dare I not condemn my fellow man, Who sees salvation on the same hill top, But treads another path to reach it. VALDÉZ. Prince, We listen with amaze; with grief much more, To hear from royal lips, from lips that once Swore to maintain the faith, such guileful words, Prompted by Satan to mislead proud youth, And goad the gallant spirit to rush on To death eternal. We are judges here, By warrant from the church;—the church heaven-born. Still draws its inspiration from above. CARLOS. Is it the will of Heaven you speak? speak mercy: Is it Christ's will you do? be charitable: And are ye so? No! shame upon you all, Your hands are bloody; to the God of peace You offer carnage: this is not divine; It cannot be: your title-deeds are forged; A mortal usurpation. Thus weak man Scans the horizon bounded by his sight, And thinks he sees the world: but the large eye Of heavenly mercy compasses the globe, And kens the savage Indian, distinct As the great King of Spain. PHILIP. Prince, I have stood In silence, but no less in pain, to hear The impious words that one whom yesterday I cherished as a son, has uttered forth: And much have I admired the patient mercy Of this tribunal:—but 'tis time to check Your reckless turbulence; the plea you make, More strongly clenches and confirms your guilt— 'Twere well that you retire. CARLOS. Your majesty Shall be obeyed; yet may I dare to hope I have not lost a father; on your mercy, Parent and king, I trust! (Turning to Don Luis and Leonora.) For you, mean souls, Who have profaned with your vile sacrilege, The holy fane of friendship, watched my lips To make their utterance destroy their master, Heated my embryo notions into life, To bid them kill their author,—still provoked My heedless confidence, and formed me thus To what I have been that ye then might sell My body to a band of bloodsuckers, Shall ye escape? no: for all time to come Shall herd ye with the accurst informer crew, And blast your names for ever! your reward Shall turn to poison in your hands, your days Of heartless luxury shall seem a chain Of heavy links binding you to a toil That galley-slaves might pity; the vain search To mingle guilt, repose, and happiness: Then pillowed restless on your couch of down, Ye shall behold a vision menacing Exclaiming vengeance! and your stricken hearts Shall tell you 'tis Don Carlos.— (To the Guards.) On! [Exit Don Carlos guarded. VALDÉZ. The prince Impels us forward; still at every step I hoped we might be able to return, And open wide the gates of mercy: now My mind is toss'd in sad perplexity; Here stands my duty to the prince, and here My oath to holy church; both I revere, Both I would fain preserve; my heart will bleed else; Through this dark wilderness one path appears: It is the glory of this holy office To be protected by the wisest king The world has ever seen; let us do homage To his unbated piety, and yield Our jurisdiction in this solemn matter To his discretion; reverend fathers, speak, Are ye content it should be thus, or stand ye In dread of censure, as unworthy servants Bending your spiritual oaths to temporal lords? LUCERO. We are content. SECOND INQUISITOR. We leave it to the king. PHILIP. Most holy fathers, dear would be to me This token of your confidence, could I Feel or think any thing, but of the fate Of my unhappy son: sad stroke for me That cuts my fair young sapling to the ground And leaves my old age withered, shelterless. Yet still retaining the same mind and heart Which sought for Spain the panoply of God, More than the arm of man, I must decline To be the arbiter; Don Carlos stands The son of Philip, but the heir of Spain: Judge ye, and I the king will pay obedience. VALDÉZ. Consider farther, sire; if this offence Is to be measured by the unchanging rules That govern our decrees, we cannot bend To charitable thoughts, or mitigate The rigour of the law: 'twere perjury In us to judge the crime that has been done Less than it is. LEONORA. Methinks such perjury Would ne'er be registered in heaven's book For future punishment. VALDÉZ. Lady, I pray attend To your own soul; our path is fenced and straight; We cannot step aside: bethink you, sire, If you can bear to hear a son condemned, To save the public welfare; 'tis a virtue So harsh and rugged that in many ages But one or two appear who have sustained Such iron trial: sire, attempt it not: We pray you to assume the easier part, To use your mercy, not invoke our justice. Philip. Not so—it seems—and yet—how said you, father? VALDÉZ. We prayed your majesty to stop this cause Ere it grow perilous: your reign deserves A sunset of repose; leave us to combat The future tempests that your heir may raise: Thus shall the people think you merciful, Your family, the queen herself rejoice To know Don Carlos safe. PHILIP. Proceed, Valdéz; The cup is bitter, but my duty bids, And I must quaff it: judges all, I pray, Speak, what your duty bids you. VALDÉZ. Hard indeed Is this command; would we might still be spared! Here in the name of this most holy office I solemnly pronounce—what noise is that? Enter Familiar. FAMILIAR. The holy bishop of Osma, reverend fathers, Has gained admittance, and insists to see The king. VALDÉZ. Unheard of insult! have we lost All dignity? None enter here! conduct The old man forth. Enter Bishop of Osma. OSMA. My king! my gracious king! PHILIP. Most reverend father, why are we disturbed, When in this temple no one of our court Has right of ingress? OSMA. Sire, most gracious king, My constant benefactor, sovereign master, It is Don Carlos brings me here; I come To plead for my dear pupil! PHILIP. Why suppose That any danger threatens him? OSMA. Alas! I know it well, these gloomy judges meet To make the prince a criminal: alas! The heavy day for me, whose waning lamp Borrows its sinking light from his bright radiance. PHILIP. Well, be it that the prince is on his trial; Sits there not here a council capable To sift the truth, that thou should'st thus intrude A new uncalled assessor? OSMA. Gracious sire, Here Justice sits alone—a frowning power, Whose presence is too terrible for man, Unless her sister, Mercy, standing by, Temper the ruthless rigour of her brow. PHILIP. Am I not here? OSMA. You should be merciful; You would be merciful were not your mind So fixed upon your duty to the state, That much I fear your heart would sooner break Than your firm will relax. PHILIP. If it be so, 'Tis well for Spain, though I should act the part Of Brutus with my son. OSMA. Oh dreadful thought! Tigers are cruel, and yet tigers spare Their offspring; vultures, eagles, leopards, wolves, All savage beasts, all bloody slaughtering birds, At the loved aspect of their own dear young Sheath their fierce claws, and tame their murderous beaks: Man, man alone is taught by vicious arts, He calls civility, to lay his hand On his own progeny. PHILIP. 'Tis vapour this: Was it to rant and rail at us you broke Our solemn councils? OSMA. Nay, turn not away: If you will try your son, let me be witness; I know the current of his thoughts; the stream Of his whole life, from his first boyish days; I know his virtues, deep and rich as gems That lie in ocean's beds; I know his faults, Swelling but transient as the drops of air That bubble on the surface and are gone. PHILIP. We ask not of his temper: facts, grave facts, Are here in question. OSMA. Let me know them, sire; They must be twisted from their natural bent, To hurt the prince. PHILIP. He has avowed them all. OSMA. Alas! he is too confident, too strong In consciousness of proud integrity, To fear the glosses that designing men May put upon his actions; from his speech An artful judge may spin a deadly sentence; But a great king, with better augury, Will grant his pardon to the generous soul Guilt cannot stain, and mercy must reclaim. PHILIP. We have well weighed these things: retire, old man, We have no need of further counsel. OSMA. One, One parting word; your prudence is of fame, Throughout the world: I marvel, therefore, prince, You should dissolve the firm cement that binds Your state to Spain; Philip and Philip's son Are of one blood, one rank, one interest: While they remain united, all men's eyes Look upwards to the throne; but make the king An isolated point, and selfish hearts Will ponder who shall to his power succeed; Your ministers, your council, most of all This proud, encroaching, monkish oligarchy, Will have their share of reverence; growing fast In strength and in support, they will presume On your declining years, and your last days Will find you helpless, uttering the will Of proud presumptuous servants. PHILIP. Think you so? OSMA. Aye, that I do, and so the world will think: The ungrateful world which stamps with its base heel The dying lion, when they mark your sceptre About to pass into the feeble hands Of a child king, will leave your will undone; Your palace void, your court a solitude; In eager homage to these busy monks, Who now with pious zeal protect your crown From filial enmity; oh! did they feel Their bosoms clear of sinister designs, They would have left the judgment of a son Where nature leaves it, where ne'er yet has failed Mind to perceive, or heart to do the right; To their undoubted lord, Philip, the king. PHILIP. This requires counsel: my most holy fathers, We have proceeded far to probe this wound; Your skill and care are grateful; yet with pain We bear the knife so near a vital part; Let us remit the rest until to-morrow: To-morrow we meet here again. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. —Room in the Inquisition. Enter Valdéz and Cordoba. CORDOBA. I cannot do this thing.— VALDÉZ. You must and will. CORDOBA. What, stain my hands with blood? VALDÉZ. Don Luis, hear; Is't that you love Don Carlos? CORDOBA. Love the prince! No—bear me witness heaven that I hate His life, his words, each atom of him.— VALDÉZ. Right! I hate him not, though for the public weal I must pursue him; were he Catholic Pure and unshaken, I would worship him, Obey him, love him; could you do the same? CORDOBA. No—that I never could—while he has life Shall I have hate.— VALDÉZ. You shallow hypocrite, To speak to me of scruples! we but toil To glut your rage, to please your private hate, To satisfy your ravenous revenge; Yet you can use the venerated words Of conscience, honour and humanity, To check my cruelty! you craven heart! CORDOBA. If any way but this of blood might serve.— VALDÉZ. Don Luis, there lived lately in Madrid One called Velasco, did you know him? Cordoba. Well: He was familiar of the holy office, And oft with him have I perform'd the duty Of seeking and denouncing heretics. VALDÉZ. Of late Have you observ'd him? CORDOBA. No—he is not dead— At least they say so—but I know not of him.— VALDÉZ. Deep in our dungeons is his bed; his grave In the same place, for never will he more From his low cell: ask you his crime, he saved Those whom our justice had condemned; forewarn'd His friends of their approaching danger, dared To interpose his thoughts 'twixt our decrees And their completion: would you follow him? CORDOBA. I know the holy ofice is severe. VALDÉZ. But most to those who serve her weakly. CORDOBA. Yet My future peace of mind— VALDÉZ. We warrant it: St. Peter held the keys of heaven: the pope Holds them from him: we from the pope: go now, Glut your own love of vengeance, do our will, And for the rest trust our authority.— CORDOBA. I go with heavy heart: may heaven forgive me! [Exit. VALDÉZ. Go, thou great criminal of little soul! Enter Lucero. VALDÉZ. What think you now Lucero of our hopes? LUCERO. The king has asked delay; but simply thus, That we should judge the cause to-morrow. VALDÉZ. Well? LUCERO. To-morrow we shall be firm as to-day. VALDÉZ. But will king Philip be as firm? or think ye It strains no heartstrings to condemn a son? To do what Philip did, required a soul Wound to the highest; he must instantly Act all he thinks, or sink to nothingness; For at that pitch no mortal mind can stay: Our greatest actions, or of good or evil, The hero's and the murderer's, spring at once From their conception: oh, how many deeds Of deathless virtue and immortal crime The world had wanted, had the actor said, I will do this to-morrow! LUCERO. Deem ye then That Philip will relent? VALDÉZ. Aye, that I do— LUCERO. Then are our lives in danger. VALDÉZ. When the prince Ascends the throne we step into our graves; Unless indeed— LUCERO. What then do you propose? VALDÉZ. Hearken to me,— Some timid compromise is even now Upon the stroke of time; the king prepares To send the queen into the prince's cell With offers of a pardon on conditions; If all goes well, as much I fear it will, Our empire's at an end, and Carlos reigns. LUCERO. How know you this? VALDÉZ. No matter how I knew it; Ask how I countermine the wavering king: How I forestall his weak designs: for this Don Luis Cordoba shall be my tool. LUCERO. What, he! already known unto the prince? VALDÉZ. That is indeed a bar: had it not been For the old foolish bishop, we had struck Our weapons home, and Cordoba been useless; Now all is doubtful; yet you know the prince Of a soft, credulous, forgiving temper That Cordoba is practised in; he goes At this same hour I speak, into the prison, Where with a flood of tears and penitence, He asks for pardon; planes away his fault With grave pretexts of fear; owns he abhors His own vile treachery, and as the proof Of his repentance, makes a confidence Of offers from the king to lead a plot That with a show of lenity should drag The prince to death: this done, he shall propose A desperate manner of escape by night, Which being accepted, I shall set a trap That ends Don Carlos' life. LUCERO. Is this the plan You mean to act on? VALDÉZ. Yes! why look you pale? LUCERO. I wonder much how you can forge a scheme So deadly, so perfidious!—how I shudder! Have you no feeling for a father's pangs? A son so young! VALDEZ. Feelings! No, none!—why should I? Is not each warmer motion of the blood, Nay, all the innocent and pure affections, Conjugal tenderness, parental love, To us forbidden? hope of progeny, That potent spell that makes us toil for others; The great command of nature that encircles In one dear nest a brood of infant loves Beneath a mother's wing; the cherished bonds That turn mere habitation into home, As sins prohibited? is it not thus, And can you hesitate? LUCERO. 'Tis so, indeed; Yet we are human. VALDÉZ. List awhile, Lucero:— I once was human; had a heart as soft To sensible impressions, tears as quick To flow for misery, and a spirit as high To right the injured as a man can have: My parents chained me to the church; but yet No oath within my power could bar the way To natural affections; and I loved— Spare me the rest. I triumphed o'er a passion, As pure, as fervent, and as well returned, As e'er bound heart to heart: I triumphed—yes, I triumphed; but the fire burnt inwards, till My soul grew hard with suffering: I became A being but half human; sense and reason, Ambition too remained, but kindlier feelings, Filial, fraternal, friendly, all were dead: I woke from agony, and found my breast Of marble. LUCERO. Your young feelings raged too wildly: We have our precept, but we have our practice; And few indeed of our most saintly men Renounce all worldly pleasures; it is well If we preserve the outward show of strictness. VALDÉZ. And think ye then that I could bear to be A slave dependant on the idle tongue Of bawds and chamberwomen? Could I creep Like a low felon at the dead of night, Belying by my steps the garb I wore? Did I not see that our least frailties Were by the world permitted but to bring Ourselves in disrepute, and weak subjection To those who hold the rod in terror o'er us? If in our body some frail vessel err, The world declares it suits not with our cloth, Does not become our holy garb and office: While this same generous world absolves itself, As if a sword and cloak might plead in bar To all impeachment of morality, And 'twere a strange unnatural circumstance For priest to sin, or layman to be pure. LUCERO. It is indeed their custom, yet our priests Suffer the raillery, and seek the sin. VALDÉZ. That would not I! mine was a soul sent forth To soar or burst: I could not trail along A thing for Scorn to buffet with his foot, Or Pride to glance at with his withering eye: But since I wore the cowl it was my care To make it honoured: every exercise Of harsh injunction, fasts beyond the rule Of the fantastic saint who built his school Of stoic wisdom 'mid the rocks and wilds, Perpetual meditation, fervent prayer, Self-chastisement, all that a man can do To make himself a spirit, I have done. LUCERO. I know it well: your fame of holiness Was bruited through all Spain. VALDÉZ. It was my aim, And I obtained it: not for empty glory; For as I rooted out the weeds of passion, One still remained, and grew till its tall plant Struck root in every fibre of my heart. It was ambition; not the mean desire Of rank or title, but great glorious sway O'er multitudes of minds. LUCERO. That you have gained. VALDÉZ. I have indeed, and why? canst thou not see? The feebleness of common man proceeds From hosts of appetites that tear the soul With mingled purpose: his resolves are weak, His vision clouded; but my appetites Were in one potent essence concentrate; I neither loved, nor feasted, nor played dice; Power was my feast, my mistress, and my game. Thus have I acted with a will entire, And wreathed the passions that distracted others Into a sceptre for myself. LUCERO. All Spain Desires you long may keep it, to preserve Our faith entire. VALDÉZ. Aye; and I will long keep it; But if Don Carlos reigns, who shall preserve The faith of Spain? and shall we stand to weigh Each grain and scruple of morality, When our great temple shakes! Shall we not rush And slay the sacrilegious enemy With his own firebrand? Trust the charge to me; Be mine the guilt; I feel not for the pangs Of those who made me wretched. I can bear To see the affections blasted; so were mine; Men bid us be of stone; now let them find We are so. LUCERO. I must yield; your intellect Ever discovers with an eagle eye The better way of safety. VALDÉZ. Let's begone, And hasten on the enterprize.— [Exeunt. SCENE II. A Prison. Don Carlos. (solus.) Abode of misery! to what a line Of wretched men am I the heir—the walls Themselves speak dreadful language, here are names; And here a thousand marks engraved to tell As many days of suffering: pshaw! away Such gloomy thoughts! they make me sick at heart.— The light is disappearing through the dim And narrow window of my cell—'tis evening! At this same hour of evening, I have stood Upon the borders of the mountain ridge That skirts the plain of Seville: the broad sun In full effulgence o'er a cloudless sky Poured his last flood of brightness: the brown hills, The aloe's hedge and rhododendron wild, The golden orange and the purple grape All seemed as clothed in light; and now 'tis gone! The god of day has vanished: a low bell The general stillness breaks, but not offends; All tongues are whispering prayer and thanks to heaven; And soon again the light guitar is heard And aged grandsires with young hearts behold The tender maidens that with graceful step Lead on the village dance—and yet how many Of those who thus rejoice, and sleep at night, And wake at sunrise with a heart at ease Would fain be Philip's heir; and dream that then They should indeed be happy—poor vain worm.— Osorio—welcome! Enter Osorio. OSORIO. How fares my gracious master? CARLOS. How should I fare but well? no accident Can here affect me; our good lords, the friars, Guard me from harm. OSORIO. May heaven defend you better Than those proud tyrants! CARLOS. Hush! speak not so loud; Their ears are quick, and you, Osorio, Who by their clemency have been allowed To tend me in my prison, must beware Lest you offend. OSORIO. Oh! for myself I fear not. But for my prince's sake I will be prudent. Know then I fear some new and perilous storm Is gathering in the sky. CARLOS. Why think you so? OSORIO. I have been keeping watch upon Don Luis: He has been busy in his practices With some that are his servants; it would seem If I am not deceived, they are preparing Their arms for enterprize this very night:— CARLOS. 'Tis well—I'm satisfied it should be so. OSORIO. I fear his treacherous and dark designs. CARLOS. I fear them not. OSORIO. You speak with confidence. Does his ingratitude not move your highness? CARLOS. Look you, Osorio—Luis has been here. OSORIO. Has he? the villain! had I met the wretch, Body to body, one of us had fallen.— CARLOS. I too indignant at his treachery Refused at first to hear him, but he came So penitent, so humble for his fault, I could not shut my ears—he knelt and wept, And I remembered of the by-gone days I loved him as a brother. OSORIO. Ah! my prince, You are too quick in your forgiveness; hasty Alike in anger and in mercy. CARLOS. Had you seen The poor wretch weep, you had forgiven him too. OSORIO. Never! CARLOS. Nay, but his reasons had prevailed. Valdéz already had the evidence To slay both me and him; he had his choice To perish with me or denounce me. OSORIO. Well— And could a brave man hesitate? CARLOS. Besides, He made conditions with the holy office My life should be preserved; which otherwise— OSORIO. Vain falsehoods all! had they the means to act Their bloody purposes, think you that Cordoba Could stay their arm? CARLOS. Yet Luis was sincere: With such an air of artlessness he spoke, And with such grief withal, no man could hear, And not believe him. OSORIO. May he have spoken truth! CARLOS. Think not I yielded to mere honied speech: He gave an earnest of his faith; for know— There is a plot on foot by which the king With show of lenity shall hold out pardon, Draw out my secrets, offer a retreat, For some few months, and under this pretence Convey me to a dungeon, where my life Shall fall a prey to fell disease, more sure Than the assassin's knife. OSORIO. 'Tis strange!—Don Luis! CARLOS. Don Luis was invited to assist In this unnatural treachery, where the father Plotted his son's destruction, but he shrunk From horrors so satanic. OSORIO. Did he indeed? CARLOS. He did indeed: what means that doubting tone? OSORIO. Nay, prince, I know not. CARLOS. He does more—he risks His liberty and life to wipe away The stain he has contracted, and to-night He comes with friends in arms to save my life. OSORIO. Indeed— CARLOS. Indeed! indeed! had you been here Osorio, all your hatred would have melted Into compassion for the high-born soul Which, formed for virtue, views with loathing dread Its one weak lapse: I would that you had seen The anxious gleaming of his generous spirit That caught at dangers with an eager longing, As if the hour that set my body free, Should liberate his mind, that now oppressed Lies in a dungeon sadder far than this, The gloom of its own thought. OSORIO. Your noble mind Is still magnanimous: I pray to heaven The former traitor may be now your friend, A real friend: but tell me more, my prince, Of his designs.— Enter Servant of the Inquisition. SERVANT. The queen approaches. CARLOS. So—farewell my friend. OSORIO. Farewell, dear master. [Exit Osorio. Enter Queen. CARLOS. Madam, at your feet I place my grateful homage; you confer Much honour on a person so unworthy Of your regard or thought. QUEEN. Alas, Don Carlos! I would you were unworthy our regard, 'Twould spare the bitterness of this affliction Unto your father. CARLOS. So—my father feels Afflicted for my sufferings; 'tis too much; I cannot play the hypocrite; the king Has placed me here, it was his choice, his act, Let him avow it, glory in it, but not hope To soothe and tame by courteous blandishment The victim that his toils have caught; to keep The prince of Spain a lion in a cage The gaze of babes and cowards. QUEEN. Hold, Don Carlos: Speak not I pray you in this angry tone, Look not, I pray you, with so fierce a glance, My will at least is not in fault, and I Deserve not your reproaches. CARLOS. Gracious queen, May heaven forbid that I should utter aught May wound the smallest nerve of yours. QUEEN. Indeed I have not earned your enmity; mistrust From you would grieve me more than sharpest hate From those I look not on as friends. CARLOS. Believe My heart is grateful, though it ne'er can pay Its debt. QUEEN. Nor thus, Don Carlos, but just now You were too stern; speak not of gratitude; I claimed your friendship, but it was in preface To that I shall deliver from the king: He offers pardon, full and gracious pardon, Utter oblivion of all past offence, Conditioned only that you shall retire For one year's space into Galicia. CARLOS. Madam, this offer, though from honied lips, Strikes not upon my dull and torpid ear With such a winning sound as chance it should: I cannot fall upon my knees and thank The king for this: how know I that my life Shall be uninjured in a distant spot, Where none shall know my fate? my friends away! And say besides how shall those friends who stand On the same brink of guilt as I, be satisfied The king intends no punishment for them? QUEEN. To them my powers extend not: nay, the king Commands before you go, you give a list Of all who practised with you, to abet The Flemish heretics. CARLOS. To give a list! He bids me give a list! a list of blood! That I should lead my friends into the toils And see them singled out for massacre By my appointment! Is it thus he asks That I should buy my life, surrendering all That makes life precious, conscience, honesty, Friendship, and faith; that I should sink unpitied To a worse grave of infamy than that The sexton digs? Could I indeed be thus, I were a victim worthy of the pangs The inquisition wreaks her vengeance with! And oh, that you, Elizabeth of France, Should hold the poisoned chalice to my lips, Mingling your sweetness with its horror. QUEEN. Prince You frighten me with these dark phrases,—why So quick in your suspicions? why so fierce In your demeanour? you were wont to be More gentle when you spoke to me. CARLOS. I was: But other times require another tone. You too were wont to be a friend to me, To friendless Carlos, who found every heart Barred to his ingress; one alone he thought Gave him compassion in return for feelings—feelings That made him pay implicit service to her: That one sole heart is now a garrison Of treacherous enemies, and shall I wear As smooth a brow, and speak in gentle tone Like these disguising monks—I cannot do it. QUEEN. Stay, stay your anger: calm this causeless rage. CARLOS. This causeless rage! oh, my full brain will burst! The objects swim before me: kind Valdéz, Thy racks have not an agony like this! QUEEN. What I have done, I did with friendly purport; May Heaven forgive me if I wounded thee; The surgeon's knife will sometimes cause a pain The foeman's sword inflicted not. CARLOS. And is it thus A healing hand would touch? was it a friend That sought to bury me in distant regions Where none could know my fate? was it a friend Covered the pit dug by my enemy To seem the steadfast ground? was it a friend Who asked me to betray my sworn allies; And thus to cast my honour and my fame In the same grave with this poor corse? [She weeps. But still I have been wrong in this: I do not mean— It is not you that I accuse: weep not; I am too fretful. QUEEN. Indeed you wrong me, Carlos. I wished to save you; could you see my heart You would not thus upbraid me; of the plot You hint at I know nothing; I am weak, Incurious, ignorant, my woman heart Governs my purblind judgment! shame on those Who practise on my simple intellect! If these conditions, as you think, convey Destruction on their wings, accept them not; There is another way that but just now Appears to me: put on this cloak, this hat; You shall pass by the guard as queen: start not, But straight do as I bid you; in an hour You may evade pursuit. CARLOS. And you? QUEEN. I stay To fill your place; no dangers cower o'er me: My faith is not suspected; I am safe After a moment's rage; and e'en the king In a few days will thank me for your safety. CARLOS. And could you stand this hazard for my sake? QUEEN. I can, and will—nay now, pause not, but haste To quit this loathsome place. CARLOS. Too generous woman! Sooner than you should for a single instant Risk your fair fame in my behalf, I would Give up my body to the fiery pincers, Let the hot lead be poured into my wounds, My limbs torn one by one from off their sockets, And suffer all that cruelty hath yet Invented to subdue the heavenly soul, Through its unworthy brother, the frail body. QUEEN. Fear not for me; yours is the peril, Carlos, Yours is the only hazard; even now, Your danger to my mind grows more and more; A woman may exceed the bounds of rule, Where pity intervenes; the world allows Indulgence to our sex when life depends Upon our fiat—go, pray, Carlos, go! CARLOS. It may not be! yet let me thank thee thus—(kisses her hand,) Would I might owe my life to you, but fate Has no such bright leaf in her book for me. [A whistle is heard. Hark! I have friends at hand, who have secured Means of escape: their signal even now Warns me that soon that iron grating yields To cunning enginry: I go, dear lady. You see I trust you with my life, and yet I beg you will away; lest you be found Within my vacant prison, and the king Suspect you of confederacy: farewell! And be my life a century or an hour, The fairest guerdon on my helm will be That once the bright Elizabeth of France, Moved by her gentle nature, offered me To risk her safety as the price of mine: On this dear jewel of my memory My heart will ever dwell, and fate in vain, Possessing that, essay to make me wretched— Away, fair queen, away.— [He climbs to the grated window at the top of his cell; the bars give way, and he escapes. [Exit Queen.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. —An Apartment in the King's Palace. Enter the King. PHILIP. And is it so? and must the die be cast? Must I appear before the Almighty Judge The slayer of my son? no other way To save my honour and my crown? Dread hour Of irremediable resolve! If now My will should err, I stain my soul with blood, With my son's blood, or else admit a plague That shall play havoc in my house, and make My name the jest of scoffing Europe; hell, Like a great gulf yawns wide before my eyes: Yet could I fix my mind, and close my fate In the same instant, 'twere already done, And Philip were a Curtius: but not so My easy task; I must perform a deed That gives a hue to all my future years, And makes my old age lonely,—shunned,—abhorred. Oh Heaven! thy ways indeed are mystery! Is it because I have obeyed so well, My trial is so high? Are thy inflictions The more severe the less they are deserved? Or has thy Paradise an endless rapture That shall repay this agony?—Valdéz! Enter Valdéz. VALDÉZ. Sire, by your majesty's commands I come To learn what light has beamed on this sad trial. You have observed, from where I placed you, all That passed betwixt the queen and prince: how stands Your royal mind affected? PHILIP. Hark, Valdéz! I stood where you desired; I watched the queen; I saw she made my offer to my son; I saw that he rejected it; I saw He pleaded for her mercy; and I saw He kissed her hand. Incensed I left the place;— Would I had never been! VALDÉZ. And, sire, the queen— PHILIP. The queen—the queen—why ask you of the queen? Is't not our wife? can she betray her duty? VALDÉZ. Far be from me suspicion so disloyal! And therefore of a blacker tinge the crime Of the base commonalty, who even now Loose their unlicensed tongues in calumny Upon the queen. PHILIP. Ha! do they so, indeed? VALDÉZ. They do: 'tis scarce a quarter of an hour Since a low fellow in the market-place, Struck by the court-purveyor, cried aloud, “There's no indulgence now in Spain for sin, Excepting for our gracious queen!” I straight Ordered the villain into prison. PHILIP. Rack the slave! VALDÉZ. It shall be done; yet I beseech you, sire, To set no count on this licentiousness: The common sort for ever turn their jests On things forbidden, and their ribaldry To-day attacks the queen: to-morrow— PHILIP. Nay, I am not moved by the base populace; And yet, methinks, their jests, their ribaldry Might spare their sovereign's honour: the low vapour, That scarcely lifts itself above the marsh In which it is engendered, can yet dim The glorious sun; how may the vilest wretch Perplex Heaven's chosen king! VALDÉZ. Yet, sire, I trust What I have said has not disturbed— PHILIP. Disturbed? Am I so fallen? is the catholic king To be diverted from his firm-set purpose By market-quarrels? No! I say again The queen and Carlos are as pure as snow, Nor shall they suffer harm for this. VALDÉZ. My king, Perhaps I am the first who bears the news Of the Valencian plot? PHILIP. Aye! what of that? VALDÉZ. It doth appear by true intelligence Troops have been levied in Valencia, To guard Don Carlos in his Flemish journey, And he consenting— PHILIP. He consenting—so— I'm glad of this—say is it proved—is't sure? VALDÉZ. Beyond all doubt: one villain has confessed: The rest had arms upon them. PHILIP. Thanks, Valdéz. You have relieved my breast of the dull load That weighed it to the earth: now shall you see What Philip, when resolved, can do! Enter Lucero. LUCERO. I come In haste to give your majesty advice— The prince has just escaped. PHILIP. Escaped, thou sayest? LUCERO. 'Tis so indeed; but we have raised the guards, And hope to reach him. PHILIP. Has he friends? LUCERO. But one Seems to have joined him near the prison gate. PHILIP. He soon shall be a prisoner: follow me. [Exit. VALDÉZ. Poor jealous king! how eagerly he seeks A robe of justice to conceal the shame Of naked passion: on Lucero, on, The deer is roused, and soon shall break his heart Within our toils. SCENE II. A Street.—Stage dark. Enter Don Carlos and Cordoba. CORDOBA. This way, this way, my prince. CARLOS. I come. How sad a brow wears this unusual night; Methinks there is some tempest in the air That dyes with deeper dark the midnight hour. CORDOBA. Indeed the sky is strangely murky. CARLOS. Aye: It seems as though the sun at his bright setting Had bid a last farewell to this poor world, Disdaining to bestow his glorious light Upon the foul or foolish deeds of men For one day longer: nay, I wonder not His patience is worn out. CORDOBA. On, on my prince! We linger here: this way—it is more private— By this small alley—ha! [Officers of the night guard and of the inquisition meet them. OFFICER. Who's there?—who's there?—Answer the word, and stand. CARLOS. These are the royal guard.—We're friends. OFFICER. If so, Go with us to the guard-house: none pass here, Without examination: 'tis our order. CARLOS. Nay then, but I will pass. OFFICER. Ho! guard! [Don Carlos fights with an officer—The guard come on the stage—Don Luis draws his sword and wounds Don Carlos as he is fighting.—Don Carlos turns round and attacks him. CARLOS. Ha! traitor! perjured wretch! die then a victim To thine own villany. CORDOBA. Oh! heaven! my life Ebbs out: forgive me, Carlos—nay refrain— Forgive me not—I am too vile a wretch To hope for man's forgiveness—heaven perhaps— CARLOS. Poor Luis! yes—I here forgive your crimes And injuries, how should I dare refuse, That do myself need mercy. CORDOBA. Noble mind! Enter Osorio: with lights and people. OSORIO. My prince; my prince; where is the prince my master? CARLOS. Here, good Osorio. OSORIO. How, my prince, you speak With feeble utterance, how is't with you? CARLOS. Hurt By a friend's treachery—but he is dead: My side is slightly wounded. OSORIO. Slightly, prince? Let us examine, for I have some skill In surgery. CARLOS. 'Twere thrown away on me. Go, tend on those whose appetite for life Is fresh and vigorous—I have tasted it So bitter that I ask no more. OSORIO. This wound Is of some danger, yet with instant care— CARLOS. I tell you that I ask no care— OSORIO. Speak not: One moment to a faithful friend, good master; You would not die thus unprepared, nor seek The Almighty Judge, till you have bared your heart Before him in repentance! CARLOS. Faithful friend, Do as thou wilt: I am not fit to die, Though loath to live. OSORIO. A bandage here, my friends, Staunch this quick flow of blood; bind up the wound— Or else— Enter Philip, Valdéz, Officers, &amp;c. PHILIP. Where is Don Carlos? lead me to the prince. Osorio here! whence art thou villain? OSORIO. Sire— I came by accident to where the prince Lay sorely wounded, and am busy now To bind his wounds, which in few moments else Will cause his death— PHILIP. Hold traitor! Take him off And cast him into prison. [Osorio is taken off by the Guards. Leave the prince. CARLOS. My father—is't my father's voice I hear? Speak to me, gracious lord! PHILIP. My son I come: Valdéz— VALDÉZ. Shall I, sire, seek a skilful leech To probe his wounds? PHILIP. No, father! Leave the prince. [To his Guards. Did you not hear that meddling servant say That he should die from loss of blood? Valdéz, I feel for Carlos as a father should, But as the king of Spain, father of all Who own her sway, Heaven bids me not bequeath Their lives and fortunes to a heretic— VALDÉZ. 'Tis spoken like a king— PHILIP. Don Carlos lies Upon the threshold of unbidden death; Shall I arrest his arm? shall I preserve A serpent in my bosom, to come forth And sting my people when I'm in my grave? No, reverend father, conscience and stern duty Compel me to this painful consummation. 'Twill soon be over. VALDÉZ. Gracious king, permit A subject to adore the sovereign wisdom Of all your deep decrees. CARLOS. Give me to drink— PHILIP. Give him to drink, Valdéz. VALDÉZ. I will: 'twere well To make all safe: here, soldier, bring us drink. [Soldier brings a cup; Valdéz puts poison in it, and sends it to Don Carlos—Don Carlos drinks. CARLOS. Father, was it indeed— Or did I dream, my father, that I heard? PHILIP. Prince, I am here.— CARLOS. Approach me, oh, my father! The chill of death encompasses me round; Yet some few awful moments still remain, Between this passing life and life eternal: Oh, let me supplicate my honoured father, That I may die in peace; load not my soul Upon its passage with a parent's curse: Forgive me, pray forgive me. PHILIP. Thy offence Must be repented—my full pardon else Will nought avail.— CARLOS. On this tremendous brink Of immortality, I dare not speak That which my heart avows not; my intent Was pure, my ends were just and merciful; This I believed in life, believe in death— But that the things I worthily conceived I acted sinfully; that my whole life Was mixed with dross of human frailty, This I confess; and, most of all, to you My father I was guilty; as a son And as a subject, bound to show the way And give the pattern of obedience To half the world; I have been hasty, rash, Irreverent—for this I pray forgiveness. PHILIP. My guards retire. [All retire but Valdéz and Lucero. In all my conduct, Carlos, I never swerved from duty sweet or harsh, Nor will I now; before I give my pardon, Answer the truth to what I ask— CARLOS. I will— PHILIP. Say then if ever you conspired to snatch The crown from off my head, by rebel hands? And leave me to expire a king deposed? CARLOS. False, by the heaven above; I never meant, I never wished, I never dreamt such crimes,— May hell now open, and its horrid jaws Swallow me straight if such unnatural treason E'er found its dwelling in my breast! PHILIP. 'Tis strange! VALDÉZ. (to Lucero.) The king is shaken,—mark, his brow relaxes! PHILIP. My heart would fain believe you—but say, farther, Have you in any hour of wicked dreams, When the fell spirit gains possession, sketched A kingdom of your fancy, where the queen, Our queen, the queen of Spain, being your age, Became your consort? CARLOS. Never, never, king. PHILIP. Have you not thought of her, adored her, loved her? CARLOS. What I have thought, in what place I have loved, Might haply better sink with me, and melt With millions of deceitful images, And frail desires of mind into oblivion; Henceforth, God is my judge; the world is none To me, nor I unto the world; yet still Since 'tis a father's voice invokes me—I will speak. I know not how our hearts are made, but mine Responded only to the voice of her Whom once I viewed as my betrothed: your wife I have revered her: yet my days and nights Were past in combat with my soul's destroyer, This monstrous passion; as my last defence I meditated flight, hence rose my crime— The intended journey into Flanders, there I hoped to vanquish, and be once more pure. PHILIP. But of the queen, Don Carlos? CARLOS. Heaven preserve her! Never did perishable casket hold So bright a jewel, never did a soul Ethereal descend to earth and catch So little of its dross; it was her praise Not to shun evil, but to think no evil. Father, I am about to die, and briefly here, Here, as a dying man, I swear by all My hopes of life eternal that the queen Heard not a whisper of my fatal passion: She's innocent to you and to her God, Had I been never thwarted, I perhaps Had washed away my sin in tears. PHILIP. My son! [Embraces him. VALDÉZ. (to Lucero.) See how his lip untwists itself, and now He throws his arms about his son. LUCERO. (to Valdéz.) Hark, father! CORDOBA. Believe the prince. PHILIP. What voice is that? CORDOBA. A villain's: But there behold a greater: on my knees I pray for punishment upon Valdéz: He told me that the king abhorr'd his son— But had not courage to—command his death— The prince is innocent—Valdéz and I [Dies. PHILIP. My son is innocent! alas! the hour When I believed your enemies—ev'n now You die a victim of my murderous hands, Perhaps there still, however—help, there—ho! CARLOS. It is too late—I feel death strangle me— But a few moments more and all is over; Thanks be to heav'n—my life has not been happy, But short and void of crime: had I been doomed To stay a longer space upon the earth, What strife, what struggles were prepared for me! Had I been fortunate, 'twere scarce with innocence, Had I been innocent, why then not happy! I was a summer plant that prematurely Bloomed in the early spring. Perhaps a day May come when Spain will ask to know my fate, And, knowing it, not censure my intent: To make men love each other was my wish, I die the victim of their hate—but stay— It is—I feel— [Dies. PHILIP. Alas! my son! what, ho! my guards, there, ho! Enter Officer and Guards. OFFICER. A messenger just now arrives from Rome, And brings these letters for your majesty With utmost speed: the prince's life, he says, As he was told, depended on his haste. PHILIP. Alas! their import's useless—yet perhaps These letters may unfold a tale—(opens the letter) what's this? (Reading) “I despatch to your majesty a sudden messenger to inform you I have discovered a letter written by the Great Inquisitor of Spain to a minister of his holiness here.—It is couched in these terms: ‘The Prince, Don Carlos, has some wild projects on foot; perhaps he might be reclaimed if the king were of a kinder temper, but his gloomy suspicions of his son, drive the young prince forwards. I therefore think it safer for our government to encourage this jealousy, and by throwing doubts into the king's mind exasperate his disposition which you know to be already dark and cruel. In a few weeks I may have to inform you of the young prince's death.’” (To Valdéz.) Villain! is this thy duty to thy king? (To the Guards.) Seize that arch traitor! Yes—Valdéz I mean— The great inquisitor. (To Valdéz.) Thou savage monster! I will not take thy life, but a lone cell, Henceforth, be thy abode. Away with him! VALDÉZ. One moment's pause I pray ye.—Think not, king, That your perpetual prison, though the worst You dare inflict upon my holy person, Shall make me wretched: I have that within Which fits me for all fortunes, I am armed With that which you affect, calm constancy: But you who send me to this punishment, Shall you be happy? no.—In my dark hours I will but call to mind your jealousies And thus be comforted: you had a son; And there he lies, the victim of your fears: You have a beauteous queen, but can you love her? Can she love you? no: your unyielding heart Repels all sympathy; your son is dead, Your wife will quickly follow; you will find Or dream a plot till you have slain her, then What shall your dreary palace hold more sweet Than my low dungeon? nay, inflict the rack: Its tortures cannot furnish half the pangs Suspicion shall inflict upon the king! [Exit Valdéz guarded. PHILIP. (solus.) May this sad story rest for ever secret! Vain hope! in one short day I have destroyed My peace of conscience and my hopes of fame! THE END.</field>
