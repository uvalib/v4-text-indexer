      <field name="fulltext">SYLLA, A Dramatic Entertainment.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO Francis Blake Delaval, Esq; Member of Parliament for Hindon in Wiltshire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. Lucius Cornelius Sylla, the Dictator. Metellus, a Roman Senator. Chrisogonus, a Freed-man. Posthumius, a Roman Senator, and Republican. Lentulus, a Roman Senator. Octavia, betrothed to Posthumius. Fulvia, Mother to Octavia. The Senate, Veterans accompanying Sylla, and Plebeians.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE ROME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Octavia and Fulvia. Octavia. It will not be; in vain my Mother pleads; My Heart is fix'd, and it can never change. Fulvia. I know you love Posthumius; but, my Child, Review our State; Rome's Liberty is lost; Sylla's her Master; he invites your Hand, And his despotic Will must be obey'd. Octavia. Let Sylla reign o'er the resistless Globe, He cannot o'er my Heart; 'tis thine Posthumius: Yet should he dieâOctavia ne'er shall wed. SCENE II. Octavia, Fulvia, Lentulus, and Posthumius. Posthumius. What do I hear my lov'd Octavia say? Am I to lose you? And must Sylla thenâ Octavia. Fear not, my Lord; shall I forget the Love, The faithful Love, which you so oft have sworn? The Services, which you have done our House? Shall I forget my Love? A Roman I, And, in the Palace of the oppressive Tyrant, I crouch! a fawning, abject, wretched Slave? No! Death alone shall tear thee from my Heart. Posthumius. Too gen'rous Woman! truly Roman born! How can I this Fidelity repay To you, who merit to command the World? Lentulus. Repay it with the Liberty of Rome; By Sylla's Death, that Tyrant Sylla's Death. Thy Country calls! what's more, Octavia calls! Posthumius. His Guards secure him, and his Pow'r's too great; And yetâtho' much we to our Country owe, The Means of Vengeance are not in our Hands: The Veteransâ Lentulus. AIR. When the Heart by Love inspir'd, By exulting Glory fir'd, Hears its hapless Country's Voice; Her Assistance is its Choice. Soon the Patriot Aid succeeds, And Tyranny detested bleeds. [Exit Lentulus. SCENE III. Enter to them Metellus. Metellus, The Senate's met, and Sylla ask's a Triumph: Haste thither, for the Time demands your Presence. Posthumius. Allow me but to take one dear Farewell. AIR. (to Octavia.) Charmer! whom my Soul adores, Tender, faithful, generous Love! My honest Heart, my Life is yours, My Passion nothing can remove. Believe in what my Lips declare, My honest Heart must truly share. [Exit Posthumius. SCENE IV. Octavia, Fulvia, Metellus. Octavia. What Pangs I feel, what Fears invade my Breast! The Gods protect and guide my dearest Love. Metellus. The Senate calls me, fear not lovely Maid; For you have Beauty must insure your Safety. AIR. The strongest of Hearts is by Beauty subdu'd, It the Savage reclames, who stalks wild thro' the Wood, The Anger Divine we have known it appease; 'Tis the Queen of the Globe, nought without it can please. [Exit Metellus. SCENE V. Octavia, Fulvia. Fulvia. What can'st thou fear? Is it ill Fortune then That Sylla lovesâwhat! the Dictator's Wife. Octavia. Ambition never tempts a Lover's Heart; Gentle Posthumius is to me a God; Sylla the worst of Tyrants, and of Men. Fulvia. Alas! thy Inexperience makes thee rave; But Time will shew what Passion now conceals. AIR. How mean is this Passion to Glory compar'd; This Folly then throw from thy Breast: Let Notions more generous now he prefer'd, To me and to Sylla give Rest. Then do not the Grandeur which summons oppose, 'Tis seldom thus freely that Fortune bestows. [Exit Fulvia. SCENE VI. Octavia sola. She who talks thus has surely never lov'd; Were he the meanest in the Roman State, My Lord's to me more estimable far, Than him who rules the Master of the World. AIR. In him my sole Content I place, No other Joy I know; 'Tis he can give my Bosom Peace, He's all I wish below: When he is absent Nature glooms, A wild deserted Waste; When he is present, Nature blooms, And perfect Bliss I taste. Exit Fulvia. SCENE VII. The Inside of the Temple of Jupiter Capitolinus; Sylla, Metellus, Posthumius, Lentulus, Senators, the Dictator's Guards, and last Chrisogonus. Sylla. The Gods, by me, have seal'd their grand Design, And Rome enjoys Tranquility at last; Our Foes are vanquish'd; Faction is no more; Their usual Vigor animates our Laws. After the Toils I've dar'd, the Perils past, In the Republic's Service, Conscript Sires, In which proud Mithridates I subdu'd, And firmly fix'd the Bound'ries of her Empire; I dare to hope your Justice will decree Such Triumphs to me, and such honour'd Rites, As you on brave Emilius once bestow'd, And the two Scipios, 'Vengers of your Wrongs. Metellus. Sylla our Foes has vanquish'd, and the Troops Have Imperator stil'd him in return; What triumph!â Posthumius. Triumph! Lentulus. He's omnipotent! CHORUS. To him, who for his Country bravely fought, With many a Wound, who gallant Laurels bought; Beneath whose Sword did Mithridates bleed, Let, to the Hero, Triumph be decreed. Who Rome aveng'd, whose mighty Name Shall be the justest Task of Fame, To every distant Kingdom known, Nor to our Realms confin'd alone. Sylla. Fathers, I thank you for this voted Triumph: Your Favours shall with fresh Incentives fire My willing Bosom, to serve Rome and you. But to the settling now the Provinces; You, Antony, in Syria shall command; You Claudius rule in Gaul; the Pretorship Of Sicily we give to you, Posthumius, Together with your Rank restor'd, and Honours. Posthumius. Honours, my Lord!âthe Tumults of the Times Involv'd me in Misfortunes not aloneâ And the ProscriptionsâBut, my Lord, permit That I refuse the Rule of Sicily!â Such Glory misbecomes an Exile's Son. Sylla. How! dare refuse my Gifts, to look Offence, And with Reproach my Clemency repay! O thankless Senators! ungrateful Romans! Whom it is hard to serve, but harder yet, Much harder to content.â Lentulus. Our Liberty!â Sylla. A glorious Liberty our Country boasts; But you, declining from your Father's Virtues, Only debate in Factions, to attain The Grasp of Power, and Dangers deal around. Posthumius. Oh! that the Gods permitted we were now!â Sylla. What Insolence! AIR. I know from whence this Boldness springs; I see at what you aim: But shun th'Effect my Anger brings; Avoid the kindled Flame. Be taught I can at Will controul The Rancour of your haughty Soul. [The Senators retire. SCENE VIII. Sylla, Metellus, Chrisogonus. Chrisogonus. To make such Fierceness tractable, my Lord, You should at once this Insolence subdue. Sylla. A Roman is not easily subdu'd. Chrisogonus. Does not Posthumius owe his Life to you, His Wealth, his Honours; shall he dare reject, And with Contempt, the Gifts you deign to add. Sylla. He loves, and is belov'd; and much he fears, During his Absence, I have strove to gain The fair Octavia from his longing Heart. Chrisogonus. Since all we've done to win her can't avail, To punish him let's force her to your Will. Metellus. How's this, my Lord, has Love subdu'd you then? That feeble Passion of inglorious Minds. Sylla. 'Tis true, Metellus, I, to whose Sword has bow'd A wondring World, by Woman am subdu'd: I saw Octavia, I forgot my Fame, My hard-won Vict'ries, and betray'd the Man. Chrisogonus. Are you not Master of the World and Rome? Do you command; Octavia shall be yours. Sylla. Her Beauty I respect, and her Misfortunes, Her Virtue, Honour; and would court her Love Rather as Sylla, than the proud Dictator. Chrisogonus. Shall you, whose boundless Will can Life dispose; Shall you then for a puling Girl thus grieve, When, with a Word, yon may command your Wish? Metellus. How base such Counsel! what a Traitor this! (aside.) By Violence like this the Tarquins fell; (to Sylla.) View the Example, tremble at their Fate. Sylla. I cannot live without her. Go, Metellus! Prepare the Order of my Triumph. Metellus. I go. AIR. Stifle the Passion while it's young That plays about thy Heart; For when Bacchus brings along Laughing Sport, and merry Song, Uncoutrol'd by Rule or Art; 'Tis hard Extremity to shun, 'Tis hard to say what Lengths you'll run. [Exit Metellus. SCENE IX. Chrisogonus. Now may my Lord perceive who's most his Friend; You heard Metellus, that Right-arm of yours, Prove that he serves not you, not you reveres, But the romantic Liberty of Rome, Of Rome, which only in her Sylla lives. Poor in Advice, and timorous of Heart, He'd to the Phantom sacrifice your Peace; For me, I honour, serve, love none but you; I bless the Gods to see your Pow'r fix'd fast, And, if I can your Happiness increase, My whole devoted Life I think too poor. Your Glory's mine, and your Command my Will; What you ordain, 'tis mine to execute. I serve but Sylla, and, if you permit, E'er Day shall run thro' half its wonted Course, I'll answer that Octavia shall be yours. Sylla. Fall at her Feet, implore her to be kind, Conjure her to attend to Sylla's Flame. Chrisogonus. Not such my Scheme; but let me use my own. Sylla. Go then. Chrisogonus. AIR. I'll tell the charming Nymph you love, The Maid whom you adore, Unless your Passion she approve, That Sylla is no more. Should she inflexible remain, And what I urge oppose, You shall by Force your Wish obtain, And dissipate your Woes. [Exit Chrisogonus. SCENE X. Sylla solus. O foolish Heart! by feeble Love subdu'd, Which Glory nor Ambition can content. Shall this aspiring Soul that aw'd the Earth, Stoop to the Bondage of a Female Frown? Shall the Dictator sigh, and crouch beneath The Feet of one, as cruel as she's fair? I am not Sylla! I forget myself; Her Graces and her Charms provoke my Love, Her cold Resistance gives the Flame new Strength: Does she prefer Posthumius then to me? A Man proscrib'd; who owes to me his Life. Yes! for thro' me Octavia's Father fell. Ye Gods! what Pangs I feel! I'm not myself: Love has o'ercome me; I embrace my Fate; For Love's the Weakness of the noblest Minds. AIR. Oh! thou who do'st my Heart inspire, My Wish, my Hope, my sole Desire; Receive my Moan, accept my Sighs, Unless you pity, Sylla dies. Upon thy Lips depends my Fate, Or Joy or Misery complete. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Fulvia's Apartment. Octavia, Fulvia. Octavia. Oh! wherefore does Posthumius thus delay? Fulvia. Why thus uneasy? Octavia. Words cannot describe How much I fear, lest the Dictator's Hate Should burst in Ruin on his destin'd Head. Fulvia. Sylla will ne'er accuse him without Cause. SCENE II. To them Posthumius hastily. Posthumius. E'en now the proud Dictator has proposedâ Octavia. What? dear Posthumius. Posthumius. To tear me from thy Bosom, he propos'd The Rule of Sicily; but I refus'd. Rely on me, and let us haste the Rites To make us one, then fly this hated Place. Fulvia, What! shall you who 'scap'd alone of the proscrib'd, Shall you thus dare oppose the great Dictator? Posthumius. What's the Dictator, while my Love's at stake? SCENE III. Octavia, Fulvia, Posthumius, and Lentulus. Lentulus (to Fulvia. Madam! Chrisogonus attends you. Fulvia. I go. [Exit Fulvia. SCENE IV. Octavia, Posthumius, and Lentulus. Posthumius. What would Chrisogonus? Octavia. Sylla, dishearten'd not that I reject This thriftless Suit, now sends Chrisogonus Anew to tempt my Mother to his Side; But Force essays to sever us in vain. Polthumius. Say then, my Fair-one, when will you be mine? AIR. (Duetto.) Oh! when shall my Heart be reliev'd from its Pain? Octavia. When! when! shall we love uncontroll'd? Posthumius. How I long for the Day when I thee may enfold! Octaaia. When no Pow'r can ever divide us again. Posthumius. Hard Fate, with Grief, my lov'd Octavia clouds; Octavia. Hard Fate the Fortune of Posthumias shrouds. SCENE V. To them re-enter Fulvia. Fulvia. Sylla, my Daughter, by Chrisogonus, Sollicits still impatiently your Hand, Who says he will no longer be refus'd. Octavia. And can my Mother thenâ Posthumius. How the Tyrant!â Fulvia. Sylla's Dictator, and for me, Octavia, Whose Parents, Sons, and Husband were proscrib'd, It is not to oppose what he ordains. Posthumius. 'Tis mine; who dares attempt to force her from me, Shall earn the Capture with my forfeit' Life. Lentulus. What urges Fulvia, to befriend this Force? SCENE VI. To them Chrisognnus, followed by Sylla's Guards. Chrisogonus. By Sylla's Orders, Madam, you must quit This Place, to go with us. Posthumius. How! Octavia! Octavia. Dares he commit such Outrage on a Roman! Fulvia. You see he dares, and he must be obey'd. Chrisogonus. AIR. 'Tis vain t'oppose the Will of Fate, All worldly things it guides, The Oracle is now complete; O'er all below your Love presides, And as a God on Earth is great. Octavia. Death to this cruel Bondage I prefer. Chrisogonus. Guards force her hence. [Exit Chrisogonus. Octavia. Posthumius! Gods! what Violence! [The Guards force off Octavia along with Fulvia. Posthumius is prevented from falling upon them by Lentulus. SCENE VII. Posthumius, Lentulus. Posthumius. Unhand me, Friend, and give my Vengeance room! Lenulus. Yes! when thy Sword has Reason for its Guide; Vengeance, unless 'tis singular, is poor. Posthumius. Can Nature lean to Reason's gentle Voice, When a fierce Tyrant robs me of my Wife. He who proscrib'd her Father and her Brother; He who has shed the dearest Blood of Rome, Stript her of Freedom, from the Senate tore Its Power, its Honours; and yet, not content With these detested Crimes, he takes by Force The last, the little Happiness I had left. AIR. Not all Arabia's wide deserted Sands; Not the worst Venoms of the poison'd Nile, Nor deepest Cavern Sicily commands, A Monster feeds more barbarous and vile, Than my Love's Ravisher, whose Blood alone Shall for this cruel Violence atone. Lentulus. I shall not quit you while in this Distress. Despair not, we'll assemble all our Friends, And something worthy of a Brutus act. Had you attack'd the Vet'rans you'd been lost; Not they, but the Dictator calls Revenge. AIR. The Sun succeeds a cloudy Sky, A Calm the blust'ring Gale; We must not fix our Hopes too high, Nor let Despair prevail. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. Sylla's Apartment. Sylla, Chrisogonus. Chrisogonus. You are obey'd; Octavia's in your Pow'r: Her Mother too, my Lord, is half your Friend; The Daughter still prefers and loves Posthumius. Sylla. This is Posthumius of the Marian Faction, Who holds from me his Honours and his Life; Whom I in Sicily had PrÃ¦tor made. Why! what a Rival! Chrisogonus. And shall he interpose 'twixt you and Bliss. Sylla. I'd have Octavia's Heart! Chrisogonus. Persist, you may! Sylla. See and bring forth this Object of my Love. [Exit Chrisogonus. SCENE IX. Sylla solus. AIR. I'm rack'd between Hope and Despair! Or her Hate or Esteem shall I gain? Her Heart with her Charms I must share, Or else the wish'd Conquest refrain. This Soul, amidst Perils, a Stranger to Fears, Now trembles, when only a Woman appears. SCENE X. Sylla, Chrisogonus, Octavia, Fulvia. Octavia. Is this, my Lord, what Rome has to expect From him who boasts the Virtues of a Sylla? Are then our Liberties despis'd, our Gods, our Laws? Fulvia. Pity, my Lord, the Troubles of her Breast, And pardon this first Impulse of her Grief. Sylla. See, fair Octavia, the Dictator lays His Triumphs, Heart, and Laurels at your Feet. Octavia. I see Oppression and tyrannic Sway, One who to all that's amiable is lost, And knows but Violence. Sylla. Oh! Madam, yet Let my strong Passion for my Faults atone. AIR. Duett. Octavia. Traitor, despair my Heart to gain, Force never shall my Hand obtain. Sylla. Yet cruel! if my Heart you knew, You'd pity what I feel for you. Octavia. If I my Bosom could unfold, Its fix'd Aversion you'd behold. Sylla. Relent, and pity me, my Fair. Octavia. Gods, will you never end my Care! Sylla. Gods, will you never end my Care! [Exit Octavia. SCENE XI. Sylla, Fulvia, and Chrisogonus. Fulvia. O'erlook, my Lord, these Transports of my Child, And time at last shall sooth her to Compliance. Sylla. Her proud Resistance but enflames my Love. Fulvia. Pity, my Lord, the Parent and the Child. AIR. The Bird that's wild when first 'tis caught, Soon tam'd, in Bondage plays; To know its Master's quickly taught, And never after strays. [Exit Fulvia. SCENE XII. Sylla, Crysogonus, Metellus. Metellus. From whence, my Lord, can this Disturbance rise? The People blame you; thro' the crouded Streets Nothing but Murmurs and Seditions reign: Posthumius, Lentulus, and Claudius Assist the Uproar, echoing Complaint, And much I fear your Life itself's in danger, Sylla. Is not the Person of the Tribune sacred? Who then dares aim at a Dictator's Life? Metellus. Will you allow that I unfold my Heart? For I have much to say, too long conceal'd. Sylla. Speak freely. Metellus. You know with what Fidelity I've follow'd, How I have serv'd you all the Civil Wars; Nor was I forc'd thy Partisans to join. When Marius, Cinna, Mithridates dar'd Oppose your Progress, this good Sword was yours, And Rome's and Sylla's Foes the same to me. Because I was a Roman thus I acted, Because I thought you only could o'erthrow The Citizens who dar'd abuse their Pow'r; You only could our Enemies subdue; You only give to Rome her Liberty: I as a God rever'd, and I believ'd you Th'Avenger and Deliverer of my Country; And have I liv'd to find myself deceiv'd? The Hand, the Heart that lov'd you stigmatis'd? Why these Proscriptions which each Hour increase? To a mean Freedman why this boundless Pow'r? Why should Chrisogonus, a wretched Greek, Dispose at Will our Fortunes and our Lives? Have then our Fathers shed their sacred Blood, And Acts atchiev'd which ne'er can be forgot, To let at last a foreign Upstart rise, Sully their Glories, and the Houses stain Of boasted Scipio, of Ãmilius brave, And all th'immortal Heroes, whose blest Shades Scoul on us from Elizium with Contempt? And yet shall you, from whom the World has Peace, You, who Rebellion stifled in its Birth, And put the Foes of Liberties to flight, Shall you oppress us? And maintain your Pow'r Only to cherish Passions far beneath Your Rank, your Honour, and your ripen'd Age? And have I fought t'enable you to proscribe Our best of Citizens, to force a Maid, Betroth'd to good Posthumius, and restore The odious Crimes of Tarquin to the Age. Sylla. Metellus, whence this Boldness? Am I then T'account with thee? Does Rome her Int'rest trust To the Dictator's Care or thine? Metellus. The Friend's Advice you answer like a Master. I've liv'd too long. Here, take this honest Sword, And plunge it in his Breast, whose only Fault Was serving thee too well; repay him thus. Chrisogonus. You see at what his Insolence would aim. [Exit Chrisogonus. Sylla. Is this the Friendship thou hast sworn, Metellus? SCENE XIII. Sylla, Metellus, Posthumius. Posthumius (angrily.) Restore the Wife you ravish'd from my Side. Sylla. Posthumius, recollect to whom you speak. Posthumius. My Passion knows him not. Remember Brutus! Sylla. Fool-hardy! fear the Pow'r which you provoke! AIR. (Trio.) Posthumius. Sylla, give me back my Love. Metellus. Do not thy Glories thus impair. Sylla. Tremble lest my Rage you prove. Posthumius. A Roman like yourself you dare. Metellus. Think that thy Country asks thy Care. Sylla. This Arm, which once made Cinna yield, Can make its Foes still quit the Field. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. a Garden. Octavia and Fulvia. Octavia. Death or Posthumius is my fix'd Resolve. Fulvia. This Obstinacy's vain; you must comply. Force shall compel, what Kindness might bestow. Octavia. Where Death's unfear'd, to menace, is but vain. SCENE II. Octavia, Fulvia, Lentulus. Lentulus. Madam! all's lost. Octavia. Gods! where's Posthumius? Tell me what has chanc'd. Lentulus. 'Spite of my Tears and Pray'rs He went, enrag'd, to find the Tyrant out, And much I fear him by his Passion lost. I met Metellus, pensive was his Mood, The Tear stood trembling in his Stoic Eye. Chrisogonus seem'd busy; what will ensue 'Tis hard to say: I fear'd, amidst these Uproars, For your Posthumius, whom I could not find. Octavia. He's lost! the Measure of my Woes is full. Lentulus. If I might be permitted to advise, You'd try yourself to soften Sylla's Heart; But let me fetch Metellus to you first. AIR. To save my Friend, I would my Life resign, For her he loves, I'd die content; Nor would I at the severing Stroke repine, Could I awhile their Fates prevent. [Exit Lentulus. SCENE III. Octavia, Fulvia. Fulvia. We are too public here; let us retire, And wait within the coming of Metellus. [Exit Fulvia. Octavia. In this sad State I know not how to act. AIR. For bitter Grief like mine, what Cure? If thro' his Love my Lord be lost; Of Ease, in Death alone, I'm sure; His Death to me my Life must cost; Haste, Time, convey me to the Elysian Shore; There, happy, we may meet, to part no more. [Exit Octavia. SCENE IV. Changes to Sylla's Closet. Sylla solus. When I reflect on what Metellus said, I own him right; when I review my Actions, And find how much my gen'rous Heart recedes From Virtue's Track, I find I'm strangely alter'd; And Sylla's Soul no more informs my Breast. From this high Pitch of Glory I have reach'd, Can I descend, and yet not risque my Fame? 'Tis very hard, oh! Greatness! Glory! Pow'r! To quit thee unconcern'd; but Beauty calls; Beauty commands my future Vows, my Heart, And my whole Happiness is center'd there. Shall then Posthumius now engross my Wish? Shall he possess the Mistress of my Soul? One, by my Clemency, from Exile sav'd; A Citizen obscure, who at the Bar Harangu'd, while I, abroad, pursu'd the War; Who gather'd, 'midst the gay Delights of Rome,â The rich Reward I from my Conquests hop'd; While I my Country's Battles bravely fought; Butâshall I revenge me on myself or Rome? Shall she upbraid me thus?âDid I commit My Pow'r to thee, and place thee at the Head Of all my Vet'rans, to abuse the Trust; Thus to oppose me, like the Rebel Sons Whom you defeated? Less perfidious they; To turn my Arms against myself, and risque My Ruin: Are you the Roman Sylla? Yes! I am Sylla! I will shew I am! What! shall I be by future Times reproach'd, My Country's Hatred, and the World's Contempt? Shall Sylla's Name be cited with the Tarquins, With Dionysius, and with Phalaris? No! let me shew such Virtues as adorn'd In her first Days the Liberty of Rome! Is not Posthumius, whom I thus condemn, Foe to false Glory, and to Grandeur vain, A virtuous Man? Who but demands the Wife, Which from him I inhumanly have forc'd? SCENE V. Sylla, Chrisogonus. Sylla. Know you if the Triumph be prepar'd? Chrisogonus. My Lord, it is. Sylla. And are the People and the Senate met? Chrisogonus. My Lord, they are! the Crowd was never greater, A Sylla's Name is loudly echo'd round. Sylla. AIR. This the most glorious Day shall be, That e'er my Life adorn'd, And Rome and all the World shall see How much I Glory scorn'd. Long shall the Day remember'd be, As Men shall Heav'n adore, Long as Rome's Sons continue free, Till Time shall be no more. [Exit with Chrisogonus. SCENE VI. Octavia, Fulvia. Octavia (impatiently.) My Lord'sâ Fulvia. No more. Octavia. What's to be done? Good Heav'n! To save my Lord, I come to seek my Foe, And now the only time I would address him He's absent;âGods! 'tis my Posthumius! SCENE VII. Octavia, Fulvia, Posthumius (with a Dagger.) Posthumius. How! my Octavia in the Tyrant's Palace! And have I found thee once again, my Love? Octavia. But why that Instrument of Death? Posthumius. 'Tis for Sylla. T'avenge my Country, thee, the World, and me. Octavia. I come to ask thy Life, or else my Death. SCENE VIII. Octavia, Fulvia, Posthumius, Metellus. Metellus. Sylla demands you instant in the Forum. Octavia. Gods! what is your Decree? Metellus. Time presses! haste! Octavia. Perhaps, Posthumius, we for ever part. AIR. Oh! bless me with one fond Embrace, Upon thy Bosom let me swear, In losing you, I lose my Peace, No other in my Heart can share. And Death I would with Joy endure, Could I, by Death, thy Life ensure. [Exeunt. SCENE IX. The Outside of a Temple; the Stage is filled with different Orders of the People. During the time of a Symphony being played, Sylla is brought forward in a Triumphal Car, richly adorn'd with the Spoils of his Victories, attended by all the Persons of the Drama: He descends, and comes forward. Sylla. Now to the Gods we've paid the Homage due; Ye conscript Sires, ye Citizens of Rome, Be taught to know what Sylla truly is. (to Posthumius.) To you, Posthumius, I restore your Honours, With her whom I ador'd, and whom you love. I only ask your Friendship in return. (to Chrisogonus.) For you who basely have abused my Trust, The Confidence which I repos'd in you, Who have disgrac'd the Grandeur of my State, And stain'd my Fame, I banish you from Rome. To the Senate. And now, ye reverend Fathers of the Senate, You who confer'd the Powers I enjoy; You Citizens, whom I have serv'd, be taught, That if with Caius Marius I engag'd, With Cinna and the factious Chiefs, who would With bold Ambition have o'erturn'd the State, 'Twas to avenge what you sustain'd I fought: If some I banish'd, 'twas to save the Empire, Whose Peace their Combinations had destroy'd. And lastly, if the Gods have given their Aid, 'Twas strongly to confirm your Liberties. While Rome demanded some intrepid Son, To stem the Torrent of her Dangers, I stept forth, And serv'd her with what Faithfulness I could. The Cause no more, Peace calmly rules again; The Laws are to their pristine Force restor'd: Allow me then to quit that Pow'r supreme, Which, as Dictator, you confer'd upon me. Love, Grandeur, and the World, I now renounce; To Wisdom I consign my future Hours: Content in some Retirement to dwell, Where I to Heav'n may offer up my Vows, For the still prosp'rous Glories of the State, That you be blest, and the Republic free. Posthumius. Unheard-of Greatness! Octavia. Happiness unhop'd! Metellus. A Conquest o'er one's self by far exceeds All that from Broils and blood-stain'd Quarrels spring. AIR (accompanied.) To Sylla be due Honours giv'n, First of the Roman State, Who has immortaliz'd his Name, His Victories made complete. CHORUS. Let Sylla's mighty Name the Lyre engage, Our boasted Freedom we from him derive, His Virtue's live through each succeeding Age; Long as yon golden Globe of Light survive. This Conquest o'er himself more Lustre throws On all his Acts, than Triumph o'er his Foes. THE END.</field>
