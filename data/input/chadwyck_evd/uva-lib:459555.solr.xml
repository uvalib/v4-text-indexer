      <field name="fulltext">JESU âEgo sum lux mundi. Qui sequitur me non ambulat in tenebris sed habebit lumen vitae.â Brethren, I am Filius Dei, the light of this world. Hee that followeth me walketh not in dearknes but hath the light of life; the scriptures so recorde; as patriarches and prophets of me bearen wytnes, both Abraham, Isaack, and Jacob in there sundrye testimonies, unto whom I was promised before the world beganne to paye there ransome and to become man. Ego et Pater unum sumus: my Father and I are all on, which hath me sent from the throne sempiternall to preach and declare his will unto man because hee loveth him above his creatures all as his treasure and dearlinge most principallâ man, I say agayne, which is his owne elect, above all creatures peculiarlye select. Wherfore, deare brethren, yt is my mynd and will to goe to Bethenye that standeth herebye, my Fathers hestes and commandmentes to fulfill. For I am the good sheppard that putteth his life in jeoperdye to save his flocke, which I love so tenderlye; as yt is written of meeâthe scripture beareth wytnesâ âbonus pastor ponit animam suam pro [ovibus] suis.â Goe we therfore, brethren, while the day is light, to do my Fathers workes, as I am fully mynded; to heale the sicke and restore the blynd to sight, that the prophecye of mee may be fulfilled. For other sheepe I have which are to me commytted. They be not of this flocke, yet will I them regard, that there may be one flocke and one sheppard. But or we goe hence, printe these sayinges in your mynd and harte; recorde them and keepe them in memorye. Contynue in my worde; from yt doe not departe. Therby shall all men knowe most perfectlye that you are my disciples and of my familie. Goe not before me, but let my word be your guide; then in your doinges you shall alwayse well speede. âSi vos manseritis in sermone meo, veri discipuli mei eritis, et cognoscetis veritatem, et veritas liberabit vos.â [PUER] (ducens Caecum) If pittie may move your jentyll harte, remember, good people, the poore and the blynd, with your charitable almes this poore man to comforte. Yt is your owne neighbour and of your owne kynd. CAECUS Your almes, good people, for charitie, to me that am blynd and never did see, your neighbour borne in this cittie; helpe or I goe hence. PETRUS Maister, instruct us in this case why this man borne blynd was. Is it for his owne trespas or elles for his parentes? JOHN Was synne the cause oryginall, wherin we be conceived all, that this blynd man was brought in thrall? JESUS Hit was neither for his offence, neither the synne of his parentes, or other fault or negligence that hee was blynd borne; but for this cause spetiallye: to sett forth Goddes great glorye, his power to shewe manifestlye, this mans sight to reforme. While the daye is fayre and bright, my Fathers workes I must worke right untyll the comminge [of] the night that light be gonne awaye. In this world when I am heare, I am the light that shyneth cleare. My light to them shall well appeare which cleeve to mee alwaye. Tunc Jesus super terram spuit et lutum faciat, et oculos Caeci manibus fricabit; postea dicat. JESUS Doe, man, as I say to thee. Goe to the water of Siloe, there washe thy eyes, and thou shalt see; and give to God the prayse. Tunc Caecus quaerit aquam et abiit Jesus. CAECUS Leade me, good child, right hastely unto the water of Siloe. Tunc lavat, et postea dicat: Praysed be God omipotent which nowe to me my sight hath sent. I see all thinges nowe here present. Blessed be God alwaye. When I had donne as God me badde, mye perfect sight forthwith I hadde; wherfore my hart is now full gladde that I doubt where I am. PRIMUS VICINUS Neighbour, if I the trueth should saye, this is the blynd man which yesterdaye asked our almes as we came this waye. Yt is the verey same. SECUNDUS VICINUS No, no, neighbour, yt is not hee, but yt is the likest to him that ever I see. One man to another like may bee, and so is hee to him. CAECUS Good men, truely I am hee that was blynd, and nowe I see. I am no other verelye; enquire of all my kynne. PRIMUS VICINUS Then tell the trueth, we thee praye, how this his happened to us sayeâ thou that even yesterdaye couldest see no yearthly thinge, and nowe seest so perfectly. No want of sight in thee we see. Declare therfore to us truelye withowt more reasoninge. CAECUS The man which we call Jesus, that worketh miracles daylye with us and whom we finde so gratiouse, anoynted my eyes with claye. And to the water of Siloe he bade me goe immediatelye and wash my eyes, and I should see; and thyder I tooke my waye. When the water on my eyes light, immediately I had my sight. Was there never yearthly wight so joyfull in his thought. SECUNDUS VICINUS Where is hee nowe, we thee praye? CAECUS I knowe not where he is, by this daye. SECUNDUS VICINUS Thou shalt with us come on this waye and to the Pharasyes these wordes saye. But yf thou would these thinges denye, yt shall helpe thee right nought. Looke up, lordinges and judges of right! We have brought you a man that had no sight and one the sabaoth day through on mans might was healed and restored forsooth. PRIMUS VICINUS Declare to them, thou wicked wight, who did restore thee to thy sight, that we may knowe anonright of this matter the trueth. CAECUS Jesus annoynted my eyes with claye and bade mee washe in Siloe, and before I come awaye my perfect sight I hadd. PRIMUS PHARASEUS This man, the trueth if I should saye, is not of Godâmy head I layeâ which doth violate the saboath daye. I judge him to be madd. SECUNDUS PHARASEUS I cannot enter into my thought that hee which hath thys marveyle wrought should be a synnerâI leeve yt nought; hit is not in my creede. Saye what is hee that did thee heale. CAECUS A prophet hee ys, withowt fayle. PRIMUS PHARASEUS Surely thou arte a knave of kynde that faynest thyselfe for to be blynde; wherfore nowe this is my mynde, the trueth to trye indeede. His father and mother, both in feere, shall come declare the matter heere, and then the trueth shall soone appeare and we put out of doubt. Goe forth, messinger, anon in hye, and fetch his parentes by and by. This knave can nought but prate and lye; I would his eyes were out. NUNTIUS Your byddinge, maister, I shall fulfill and doe my dutye as is good skill, for this daye hither I knowe the will, and I shall spie them out. Tunc circumspectat, et adloquitur eos: Syr and dame, both in feare, you must afore the Pharasies appeare. What there will is, there shall you heare. Have donne and come your waye. MATER Alas, man, what doe we heere? Must we afore the Pharasyes appeare? A vengeance on them farre and neare; they never did poore men good! PATER Dame, here is no other waye but there commandment wee must obeye, or elles they would without delaye course us and take our good. NUNCIUS Here I have brought as you bade me these two persons that aged bee. They be the parentes of him truely which sayd that he was blynde. PRIMUS PHARASEUS Come neare to us both too, and tell us truely or ere wee goe whether this be your sonne or noeâ looke noe descent we fynde. PATER Maysters, we knowe certaynlye our sonne hee isâwe cannot denyeâ and blynd was borne, undoubtedly, and that we will depose. But whoe restored him to his sight we be uncertayne, by God almight. Wherfore of him, as is right, the trueth you must enquyre. MATER For he hath age his tale to tell, and his mother-tonge to utter hit well; although hee could never bye nor sell, lett him speake, we desyre. PRIMUS PHARASEUS Give prayse to God, thou craftie knave, and looke hereafter thou do not rave nor saye that Jesus did thee save and restored thee to thy sight. SECUNDUS PHARASEUS Hee is a sinner and that wee knowe, disceavinge the people to and froe. This is most true that wee thee showe. Beleeve us as is right. CAECUS If he bee sinfull I doe not knowe, but this is trueth that I doe showe. When I was blynd and in great woe, hee cured me, as yee see. PRIMUS PHARASEUS What did hee, thou lither swayne? CECUS I tould you once; will you here hit agayne? Or his disciples will [you] become, of all your sinnes to have remission? SECUNDUS PHARASEUS O cursed caytyffe, yll moote thow thee! Would thou have us his disciples to bee? No, no! Moyses disciples binne wee, for God with him did speake. But whence this is, I never knewe. CECUS I marvayle of that, as I am treweâ that you knowe not from whence hee should bee that me cured that never did seeâ knowinge this most certaynlye: God wyll not sinners here. But hee that honoreth God truely, him will hee here by and by and grant his askinge gratiously, for that man is to him deare. And to this I dare be bould, there is noe man that ever could restore a creature to his sight that was blynd borne and never sawe light. If he of God were not, iwis, hee could never worke such thinges as this. PRIMUS PHARASEUS What, sinfull knave! Wilt thou teach us which all the scriptures can discusse, and of our livinge be so vertuous? We curse thee owt of this place. JESUS Beleeves thou in God Sonne trulye? CAECUS Yea, gratious lord. Whoe is hee? JESUS Thou hast him seene with thy eyee. Hee is the same that talketh with thee. CAECUS Then I here, I honour him with hart free, and ever shall serve him untill I dye. PRIMUS JUDEUS Saye, man that makest such maistrye, or thow our sowles doe anoye, tell us here appertly Christ yf that thou be. JESUS That I spake to you openlye and workes that I doe verelye in my Fathers name almightie beareth wytnes of mee. But you beleeve not as you seene, for of my sheepe yee ne beene; but my flocke, withowten weene, here my voyce alwaye. And I knowe them well eychon, for with me alwaye the gonne; and for them I ordayned in my owne everlastinge life for aye. No man shall reave my sheepe from me, for my Father in majestie ys greater then binne all yee, or any that ever was. SECUNDUS JUDEUS Thou shalt abye, by my bone, or thou heathen passe. Helpe, fellowe, and gather stones and beate him well, for cockes bones. He scornes us quiantlye for the nones and doth us great anoye. Tunc lapides colligunt. Yea, stones nowe here I have for this rybauld that thus can rave. One stroke, as God me save, he shall have soone in hye. JESUS Wretches, manye a good deede I have donne, yea in great neede; nowe quite you fowle my meede to stone me on this manere. PRIMUS JUDEUS For thy good deede that thou hast wrought at this tyme stone we thee nought. Both in word and thought there thou lyes falselye. JESUS But I doe well and truely my Fathers biddinge by and by, elles may you hope well I lye and then leeves you me nought. But sythen you will not leeve me, nor my deedes that you may see, to them beleevinge takes yee, for nothinge may be soother. Soe may you knowe well and verey in my Father that I ame aye, and hee in mee, sooth to saye, and eyther of us in other. Tunc colligunt lapides et statim evanescit Jesus. SECUNDUS JUDEUS Owt, owt, alas where is our fonne? Quyntly that hee is heathen gonne. I would have taken him, and that anone, and fowle him all to-frapped. Yea, make we never so much mone, nowe there is noe other wonne, for hee and his men everychone are from us clearly scaped. PRIMUS JUDEUS Nowe by the death I shall one dye, may I see him with my eye, to syr Cayphas I shall him wrye and tell that shall him deare. See I never none, by my faye, when I had stones, soe soone awaye. But yet no force! Another daye his tabret we shall feare. MARIA A, lord Jesu, that me is woo to wytt my brother syckly soo! In feeble tyme Christ yoode me froo. Well were we and hee were here. MARTHA Yea, sister, abowt I will goe and seeke Jesu too and froo. To helpe him hee would be throo and hee wyst how hit were. Tunc venit Jesus. A, my lord, sweete Jesus, mercye! Lazar, that thou loved tenderlye, lyeth sicke a little herebye and suffereth mych teene. JESUS Yea, woman, I tell thee wytterlye, that sickenes is not deadly but Godes Sonne to glorifie. Loe, I am him, as may be seene. Tunc ibit Martha and Mariam. MARIA A, Martha, sister, alas, alas! My brother ys dead syth thou heere was. Had Jesus my lord binne in this, this case had not befalne. MARTHA Yea, sister, neare is Godes grace. Manye a man hee holpen hasse. Yett may hee doe for us in this case and him to life call. MARIA Here will I sitt and mourninge make tyll that Jesu my sorrowe slake. My teene to harte, lord, thou take, and leeche mee of my woe. MARTHA In sorrowe and woe here wyll I wake, and lament for Lazar my brothers sake. Though I for coulde and pennance quake, heathen will I not goe. Tunc pariter juxta sepulchrum sedebunt plorantes, et Jesus procul sit. JESUS Brethren, goe we to Judye. PETRUS Maister, right nowe thou well might see the Jewes would have stoned thee, and yett thou wilt agayne? JESUS Wott you not well this is vereye, that xii houres are in the daye and whoeso walketh that tyme a waye trespasseth not, the sooth to saye? Hee offendeth not that goeth in light; but whosoever walketh abowte in night, hee tresspasseth all agaynst the right, and light in him is non. Whye I saye this, as I have tight, I shall tell you soone in height. Have mynd on hit through your might and thinkes well thereupon. To the daye myselfe may likened be, and to the xii houres all yee that lightened be through followinge mee that am most likinge light. For worldes light I am verey, and whoesoe followeth me, sooth to saye, hee may goe no Chester waye, for light in him is dight. âOportet me operari opera eius qui misit me donec dies est; venit nox quando nemo potest operari. Quamdiu sum in mundo, lux sum mundi.â Brethren, I tell you tidinges: Lazar my freinde is sleepinge. Thether wee must be goinge, upon him for to call. JOHN Lord, if hee sleepe, saffe hee may bee, for in his sleepe no perrill is hee. Therfore yt is not good for thee goe thider for soe smale. JESUS I tell you, brethren, certenlye; Lazar is deade, and thyder will I. Fayne I am, I wott, that I was not there, as you may see. We goe thider anon in hye. THOMAS Followe him, brethren, to his anoye, and dye with him devoutly, for other hit will not bee. Tunc versus locum ibit Jesus ubi Maria et Martha sedent, et Martha fuit obviam. MARTHA A, lord Jesu, haddest thou binne here leade, Lazar my brother had not binne deade; but well I wott thou wilt us reade, nowe thou arte with us here. And this I leeve and hope aright: what thinge thou askest of God almight, hee will grant yt thee in height and grant thee thy prayer. JESUS Thy brother, Martha, shall ryse, I saye. MARTHA That leeve I, lord, in good faye, that hee shall ryse the last daye; then hope I him to see. JESUS Martha, I tell thee withowt naye, I am risynge and life verey; which liffe shall last for aye and never shall ended be. Whosoever leeveth steedfastlye in meeâI tell thee trulyeâ though he dead bee and downe lye, shall live and fare well. Leeves thou, woman, that this maye? MARTHA Lord, I leeve and leeve mon that thou arte Christ, Godes Sonne, is commen into this worlde to wonne, mans boote for to bee. This have I leeved steedfastlye; therfore on mee thou have mercye, and on my sister eke Marye. I will fetch her to thee. Tunc Martha ibit et vocabit Mariam, dicens MARTHA A, Marye, sister leeffe and deare, hye thee quickly and come neare. My sweete lord Jesu hee is here, calleth thee him to. MARIA A, well were we and hit so were! But had my lovely lord of leere seene my brother lye one beare, some boote might have binne donne. But nowe he stinketh, sooth to saye, for nowe this is the fourth daye syth hee was buryed in the claye, that was to mee so leeffe. But yet my lord I will assaye, and with all my hart him I praye to comforte us, and that hee may and mend all our mischeiffe. Tunc Maria videns Jesum prosternat se ad pedes, dicens: A, lord Jesu, haddest thou binne here, Lazarre my brother, thy owne deare, had not binne dead in this manere. Mych sorrowe is me upon. JESUS Where have yee donne him? Telles mee. MARYE Lord, come hither and thou may see, for buryed in this place is hee fore dayes nowe agonne. Tunc venient Judei, quorum dicat Primus. PRIMUS JUDEUS See, fellowe, for cockes soule, this freake beginneth to reeme and yowle and make great dowle for gowle that hee loved well before. SECUNDUS JUDEUS Hee hadd cunninge, meethinke hee might from death have saved Lazarre by right, as well as send that man his sight, that which so blynd was borne. JESUS Have donne, and put awaye the stone. MARTHA A, lord, foure dayes be agone syth hee was buried, bloodd and bonne. He stynkes, lord, in good faye. JESUS Martha, sayd I not to thee if that thou fullye leeved in mee Godes grace soone shalt thou see? Therfore doe as I thee saye. Tunc deponent lapidem de sepulchro, et Jesus tergum vertens, manibus elevatis, dicit. JESUS Father of heaven, I thanke yt thee that so soone hasse hard mee. Well I wist and soothly see thou hearest myne intent. But for this people that stande hereby speake I the more openlye, that they may leeve steedfastly from thee that I was sent. JESUS Lazarre, come forth, I bydd thee! LAZARUS A, lord, blessed most thou be which from death to life hast raysed mee through thy micle might. Lord, when I hard the voyce of thee, all hell fayled of there postie, so fast from them my soule can flee; all divells were afrayd. JESUS Loose him nowe and lett him goe. MARTHA A, lord, honored be thou oo that us hast saved from mych woe as thou hast oft beforne. For well I wist hit should be soo, when ye were full farre froo. The, lord, I honour, and no moo, kneelinge upon my kneene. MARIA A, lord Jesu, mych is thy might, for nowe my harte is glad and light to see my brother ryse in my sight here before all these men. Well I hoped that soone in height when thou came yt should fare aright. The, lord, I honour with all my might, kneelinge upon my knees. A, lord Jesu, I thanke thee, that one my brother hase pittie. By verey signe nowe men maye see that thou arte Godes Sonne. With thee ever, lord, will I bee and serve thee with harte free that this daye hase gladdedd mee, and alwaye with thee wonne. [JESUS] Have good-day, my doughter deare. Whereever you goe, farre or neare, my blessinge I give you here. To Jerusalem I take the waye. Finis</field>
