      <field name="fulltext">Act 1. Scene 1. Beatrice Villiers and her friend, Dorothea Buchanan.âA Sitting-room in Paris. Bea. âDo you think he loves me, Dorothea? Dor. âBeatrice, I am sure of it. Why, he was perfectly âspoonyâ at the ball the other night. Perfectly blind to any one else. Your charms are very absorbing, you know, my dear. But you have two strings to your bow, besides. You have made a double conquest Mr. Wilson is hopelessly in love with you. Bea. âMr. Wilson! How I hate that man! Dor. âWhy? Poor fellow, he adores the very ground you tread upon. Bea. âI only wish he would! I wish he would do anything rather than adore me! Dor. âOh, Beatrice, you are too hard; he is very handsome. Bea. âI don't think so. Dor. âNo, I know you have no eyes and less heart for anybody, except Mr. Raynor. You are as âspoonyâ as he isâonly you are a woman, and won't show it. I can't understand you, Beatrice. Can't comprehend or fathom the abysses of your nature at all. Why, in the name of Providence, don't you put the poor creature out of his misery âand yourself as wellâand get it all over. That's what I should do! Bea. âI dare say you would. Dor. âOf course I would. And now, with all these horrid rumours of war flying about, it's just as well to be swift in one's course of action. There won't be much time for love-making soon. Bea. âThat's just the point. It does seem such a mockery with such a frightful war impending, and such sounds of sorrow and trouble in the air, to be thinking of nothing but love. Besides, Edward is not half a man yet; he is a mere boy. He has never done anything. Dor. âWhat, in the name of Fortune, do you want him to do? Fly to the top of some mountain for you, and fetch you the Roc's egg? Perform a pilgrimage, or go on a crusade and slaughter the infidels, like the brave knights of oldâ all in honour of your fair eyes? Bea. âNo; but I do want him to learn action, like a man. He flutters after me now like a mere, brainless boy. Somehow, one gets tired of boys. Dor. âWell, try Mr. Wilson. Bea. âHe is worse. He has no capacity for action in himâexcept for bad action. Dor. âYou are bitter. Bea. âNot too bitter. He proposed marriage to me the other night. Dor. âAnd youâ? Bea. âHeartily refused him. Dor. âWell, what was there bad in that? Was it bad taste to choose you? Bea. âNo; nothing bad in that, but the man himself is bad, I am certainâbad to the core. Women have an instinct of discernment, I think; they can read the heart in the face. Dor. âIn the face! Well, the face is not so unlike Mr. Raynor's, after all. I have heard people commenting on the wonderful resemblance they bear to one another. Bea. âResemblance!âyes, as a jackal resembles a lion, or a ferret a greyhound, or a shrike an eagle! Don't be so silly. Dor. âWhich is the lion, and which is the jackal; which is the eagle, and which is the shrike? The ferret and greyhound I won't mention. Bea. (looking graver, and moving away slightly) âHow can you ask? [A pause. Dor. (sighing pensively) âWell, well, Beatrice, I only wish I had half your chances. I am doomed, by my father's arrangement, to enter a nunneryâafter a year or two more of the blue sky and the sweet summer wind, you know. Bea. âTrue, and I don't think you are one bit fitted for the life. But, then, you won't have to stay there for ever, unless you like. You are only to go through your novitiate, or whatever they call itâa course of trial and trainingâand then, if you don't like it, you will be free to soar out again (as I fancy you probably will), like some imprisoned butterfly, towards your blue sky and sweet summer air. Dor. âYes; but all the weary timeâyears, perhapsâfirst! To be shut up in a nunnery for the sweetest, freshest days of one's life, while the breezes are blowing, and the haymakers mowing, and the green grass growing, and the bright streams flowing, and the roses glowingâand the lovers proposingâoutside, eh! It does seem hard. Bea. âWell, my dear, don't think of it. It will all come right somehow. What is it Tennyson says? âTurn, Fortune, turn thy wheel,â and so on. Dor. âYes; and I hope the turn of Fortune's wheel will bring me something good one of these days. But what are you going to do about this dear Mr. Raynor âthis mere schoolboy as you call him? Nuns (like priests) always take a specially deep and considerate interest in the love affairs of others, you knowâbecause they can't have any of their own. Bea. âI didn't call him a schoolboy. Dor. âWell, this Mr. Raynor. We will consider that he has just completed school-life, and arrived at college. Bea. âI am going to put him to a test. I have been thinking of it, and maturing my plan, while you have been chattering. I am going to send him to the Crusades, as you proposedâthe modern Crusadesâfar fiercer and more sanguinary than the old ones, by-the-by. [Turning her face aside slightly, and half sighing; a dreamy and far-away look coming over her eyes, as though, in the midst of their merriment, a foreboding touched her. Speaking lightly again. I am going to charge him by his love for me to show some love for that France which I love so deeply. [Her face changes, and she speaks with considerable emotion.] You know how I love France, my adopted country. I am going, as the ladies of old gave their true knights their colours to wear in the battle and sent them forth, to send him forth to fight for my country. France is my country. N.B.âI don't think he'll go. Dor. (much sobered, speaking seriously) âBut if he does go? Bea. âHe won't, my dearâbut if he does, I shall know there is more in him than I fancy; he will have turned out a truer hero than I take him for. I might even be disposed to entertain the thought of marrying himâafterwards. Dor. âAfterwards! Bea. âYes; afterwards. Dorothea, why do you look so serious? I see. You are beginning to practise already for a nun. Dor. âBeatrice! He might go, andâmight not come back. Bea. âNonsense, dear; look at the bright side. Besides, I tell you he won't go. [A knock at the door. Servant enters. Mr. Raynor. Bea. âOh, dear, what shall we do; here he is. Dorothea, love, hide in that corner, behind those screensâdo, dear, to oblige me. I'll give you a lesson in managing lovers. Now you shall hear him sent off to the war. I'll give him his commissionâin the cavalry âhe rides Love's fiery steeds so well. Are you hidden, Dorothy? Dor. âYes; but I don't like it. Bea. âHush, hush! (To the servant.) Bring Mr. Raynor in. Here he comes. [Enter Raynor, flushed and anxious-looking. Ray. âBeatrice! Bea. âSir! Ray. âI am come to bring all this to an end, Beatrice. Yesâyou may startâ but I am in earnest this time; and I mean to have an answer. I cannot bear this sort of thing any longer. You know how I love you, sweet, sweet, my sweet. You know that my whole heart is yours. Don'tâdon't, for God's sake play with me any longer. Can you love me?âor can you not? Bea. (who has listened, half-tearful, half-smiling.) âSir, that question of yours needs some consideration before one can answer it. Ray. âYou have had long enough to consider âmonthsâyears. Beatrice, you must answer, and you must answer now. Bea. âMust? Ray. âMust. Bea. âWho will make me? Ray. âBeatrice, Beatrice, you were created to torture and enslave the souls of men, I believe; but specially to torture and enslave me. Now that you are so thoroughly carrying out the purposes for which you were createdâand a tiger's soul thrust into that fair spotless body of yoursâI trust you are satisfied. Bea. âQuite. What a poetical description! Ray. âGood-by, then, Beatrice. If you have nothing more to say to me, I am going. Bea. âOne moment, sir. I have a thought. If you want to win me, will you fight for me? Ray. âFight? what do you mean? Bea. âWill you fight for my countryâfor France? Or is all your love-making to be done, like the love-making of the poets, with fine words and pens and paper? Ray. âWhat do you mean? Bea. âWhat I say! Will you cease to be passionate?âwomen get tired of that âand it is so easy for some menâ and boys (yawning)âand become practical. Don't stay in Paris running after a woman's love, when the work of a man is soon to be done on the frontier. There will be a war (I know many of the Ministers, and can speak with authority)âthere will be a war and a terrible one. Go and fight. Ray. âYou are in earnest? Bea. âI am. I do not change. I say what I mean. Ray. âBy Jove! you are the first woman, then, that ever did so! But I will go, and go gladly. Bea. âYou will? Ray. âI will. Your country is my country. I am an Englishman, heart and soul, but I will love France, and fight for her to the best of my power (if I can get into the French army by any means) for your sake. And when I returnâif I return, I meanâI shall have my reward? Bea. âPerhaps. (Their eyes meet. He sees, or thinks he sees, that she loves him, and turns away smiling.) Ray. âGood-by, Beatrice. I think I know how I can get a commissionâthrough some friends of mine. Indeed, I am sure I can. Good-by. I shall not see you again before I start. May I kiss your hand? [She hesitates. Bea. âYes. Ray. âGod bless you. [He turns to go. When he reaches the door, he lingers, his hand on the handle. Good-by, Beatrice; my one love, my own darling. God bless you. Remember your promise. [Exit. [Beatrice sinks into a chair, exhausted and half fainting. Dorothea comes out, pale and in tears. Dor. âOh, Beatrice, what have you done? You will never see him again. Bea. âOh, my God! how I love him. [She presses her hand upon her heart, and plucks nervously at her tight girdle. Dor. âAh, pluck at your girdle, Beatrice; pluck at your girdle. It is too tight round your heart, is it not? Women always find their zones too tight, just after they have broken the heart of another. Bea. âOh, Dorothy, Dorothy, I never thought he would go. Has he gone? Is it too late? [She rises, and rushes to the window. Gone, gone, my love! my love! Too late. [She faints.âScene closes. Scene 2. Room in Bachelor Lodging in Paris.âJames Wilson alone. He walks to and fro. Rejected! and by herâand well I know To whom her gentle favouring love is given! Yes: to the very man in all the world Whom most I hate, and who the most hates me. Reasons I have which some might think sufficient. Ah! mother was thy debt of deadly vengeance Bequeathed to me, thy lonely son, in vain? Can I not strike the father who betrayed Thy loving trust, and strike his stately wife, Through their proud son, this man they call my brother; This cursed, thrice accursed, Edward Raynor? Can I not strike through him, and strike him through This haughty beauty; this white-handed Beatrice, This English maiden, shining here in Paris Like some fair star that has wandered by mistake From shining over English cliffs and seas, And now illumes the valley of the Seine? Can I not strike and wound him, pierce him perhaps To deathâa death of agony most bitter, By piercing first the bosom of the lady? So shall I be avenged for this, the slight That she has put upon me: I shall see The features, just now proud in self-command, And fervent with imperious disdain, These I shall mark, relax and quiver soonâ Down on her knees to beg, to crave, my pardon My fair pure lady presently shall fall, For I will find the means of humbling her: Aye, means of bringing her to the very dust Of woman's lowest, worst humiliation. IâI shall be avenged: and through my triumph Over this woman-soul, whom once I lovedâ Once doted onâfor whom I would have died; [His voice and face grow softer for a moment. But whom I hate now, whom good God! I loathe! Through my triumphant victory over her, My mother's victory shall be furthered too, And our strong other enemies debased. Ah! Beatrice, poor fool, you little knew me, When once you thought a woman could undo me! A plan I haveâpen! paper! down it goes. [He sits down and writes hastily. Rising with paper in hand, which he flourishes about as he walks up and downâ Good! Excellent device! oh cunning father Of lies and all devices of revenge, Father of every roguish stratagem, Parent of all deceit and every wile, I thy true son, do thank thee, father Satan, That thus thou hast inspired me to a scheme Which must o'erthrow the snow-white innocence That her contempt for me turned only now Into a full-flushed rose; ah! burning cheeks Of womanâswift, indignant, fiery flower! Soon ye shall flame againânot for one hour, But through long miseries of disastrous weeks! Hear, Beatrice, thy lover Satan speaksâ Oh, he will build thee, sweet, a rosecrowned bower, Like unto that which every maiden seeks, And round it all impassioned perfumes shower: Lo! Love despised, Love's shoreless vengeance wreaks! Or, if there be a shore, let Satan's power Drive the red tides of vengeance up the creeks. Oh, snow-white hands, and bosom softly beating For him, my rival, let my high disdain Urge thee towards cliff-tops whence is no retreating, Where every flower is a flower of pain. Oh, tender heart, that so canst softly listen To one well-loved and ever tuneful voice, Thine eyes with burning tears shall shortly glisten. Love comes; at his step thou shalt no rejoice. Oh, Beatrice, once lovedâfor ever hated, Thou art a woman, lovely; shall I spare? Nay rather, just because thou art so fair, Love's kiss of vengeance lingers, nor is sated. Because thy lips are roses in an air Of everlasting summer, I will tear The scented leaves with rapture unabated. Scene 3. In the Champs ElysÃ©es, lighted up at night.â Amine and Gustave walking together. Amine is the maid of Beatrice Villiers. Gustave her lover. He has been a lad at a confectioner's shop in the Rue de Rivoli, and has just entered the French army. But he is not, on this occasion, in uniform. Am. âWell, Gustave, my darling, my beauty, how splendid you will look in uniform âquite a Princeâa perfect Napoleon! The chers pantalons rouges! Far, far better than your silly, white, grocery, greasy, tarty things! One was always afraid (Gustave: Always?) âalways afraid to kiss you then; you looked so like a boy! I was constantly afraid you would be taken for my little brotherâand the couple of us for a brother and sister taking a brotherly and sisterly walk! Gus. âSo you took care, ma belle, to be caught kissing one day by the big gendarme in the Place VendÃ´me, not to seem too sisterly, I suppose? Or were those amiable kisses sisterly ones, petite? Am. âOf course they were; what else? As sisterly as this one (kisses him). But now, mon brave, mon petit caporalâ now that you are a real soldier, and will soon be a Field Marshal with the Cross of the Legion of Honour and ever so many other crosses, look youâ and two or three wooden arms and legs and other decorationsâsplendidly dÃ©corÃ©â Gus. âBut, Amine, I don't want to be dÃ©corÃ© with wooden arms and legs. Rather than that, I would not be decorated at all. Am. âOh, Gustave, Gustave, you have no spirit at all; you will never do for a Field Marshal. Don't you know they all have wooden legs! Gus. âAnd wooden lips, some of them, too, Amine dear, I suspect. No man with a wooden leg can kiss well; he can only take it off to beat his wife with. That is the real use of a wooden leg âto beat a woman's wooden will into subjection, and her steel-clapper of a tongue into silence. Amine (draws her arm out from Gustave's). âGustave! I do not love you. You are a brute. I will never marry a brute. Gus. âWhat! not when he is going to be a Field Marshal, wooden leg and all? I was just telling you about the true uses of a wooden leg. Here, little one, nibble a bit of my chocolateâ from the best tin in the shop, I assure you, upon the honour of a French soldier! Stay, I will myself bite itâ moi-mÃªme. I have the strong teeth. [He takes a very large lump of chocolate out of his pocket, bites off a piece, and gives her the piece he has bitten between his lips, trying to kiss her and to put it into her mouth from his lips. She pouts playfully, and runs away; he pursues. Now, Amine, darling, I will give you a lesson in the art of la guerre. Vive la Guerre! Vive l' Amour! Vive l' Amine! A bas les Prussiens! You are the PrussiansâI am Napoleon: Napoleon the First, or Napoleon the Third, it is all one. Now I will show you how the PrussiansâbÃªtes that they areâ are to be caught and beaten; not like wives, with wooden legs, but like rascals, with steel bayonets. [He runs after her, and catches her, and kisses her, and puts the great lump of chocolate between her lips from hisâshe now submitting, flushed, but quietly. Then he bites off another piece, and puts it in his own mouth, returning the remainder to his pocket. They look at each other with their mouths full, munching and laughing. Am. âBut, Gustave, darling, let us be serious. You are going to be a great soldier, you know, and I am to be very proud of you. You will no longer be laughed at as the pastry-cook's garÃ§on of the Rue de Rivoli; you will be admired and worshipped. All the girls will fall in love with you; you will forget poor Amine! Gus. âNeverâ(melodramatically)âwhile I have a bit of chocolate in the world, I will share it with theeâwith thee. Am. âNonsense. Do you know I may see you again before very long, after all? My mistress, Mademoiselle Villiers, is about to journey with her father, the Grand Monsieur, to their chÃ¢teau in the country; she departs almost at once. There will be fighting in that part of the country, they say; she is a brave Mademoiselle to go at allâ but ah, bah! it is like the English! And her papa will have to leave her, too, for he has business elsewhere. He can only take her to the chÃ¢teau; he cannot stay long. I don't think he likes it much, but pretty Mamselle will have her own way! So you see, Gustave, we may meet again. I may see you kill a Prussian, with my own eyes. Gus. âMy dear, keep âyour eyesâ for Frenchmen; you have killed enough Frenchmen âwith your own eyesâ already, besides an Italian or two, and a Poleâa real beauty, the last! Do not invade Germany; Ã  Berlin is our business. Am. âBah! bah! you know what I mean. I may see you with your own hands kill a Prussian orâah! I forgot, I may see you wounded; killed, perhaps, under my very eyes. Oh, Gustave! I did not think of that; that is very different. Gus. âDear Amine, I was âkilled under your very eyes,â sweet black eyes! when first I fell in love with you; leaped in love with you, rather, as we fiery young Parisians do! Now âkill me under your very lips!â [They kiss softly and earnestly, growing more subdued and quieter. He continuesâ But why this sudden departure, Amine, of your Mademoiselle for her chÃ¢teau? Is she sick of the gaiety of Paris? Amine (puts her head close to him, and whispers.) âI will tell you a secret, Gustave, if you will promise to keep it for ever and ever. Mademoiselle is in love; in love with the handsome young English milord, Monsieur Edouard Raynor. She adores him. They have quarrelled, Gustave; quarrelled sadly. I overheard their voices in the drawing-room. He goes to the war, so I think, and sheâwhy look you, to be as near to him as she canâshe follows. Just what I am doing for you, Gustave, mon ami! Gus. âQuarrelled?âhave they?âwhat a pity! The handsome young Monsieur and Mademoiselle who used to eat so many tarts and sweets in my shop that I ever wondered at the marvellous midday appetite of the English! I am so sorry. But it is well for us, tooâfor you and me, Amine; for now that your mistress is leaving Paris for the country, as you say, we may meet, though I wish you were farther off from all the fighting and bloodshed that may shortly take place. Am. âNo; it will be well with me. I shall be where a brave French girl should be in time of troubleânot far from the sound of the battle. But, Gustave, the streets are clearing; let us sing as we pass homeâit is late, and I must go nowâthat song we learnt the other day about Love and War. Our farewell song it will be, darlingâwe shall not meet again in Paris. Come âthere is no one aboutânot a solitary sergent de ville. Gus. âBienâlet us sing; it is a good song to sing before parting. [They advance and sing. Amine- We part, but we shall meet again When the sound of war is overâ Me to thy breast thou then shalt strain, O, soldier, knight, and lover! Together- When the sound of war is over, In happy days we twain Shall surely meet againâ When the sound of war is over! Gustave- We part, but we shall surely meet, Soft happy days shall find us, The wings of sorrow shall retreat, Let us face the fate assigned us. Chorus. Amine- One last sweet kiss to deepen bliss, Lest I be broken-hearted, That I may know you left me soâ That thus my king departed! Chorus. Gustave- Yes; this last kiss to seal our bliss, My sweetâmy queen and lady; For then I go far from Love's glow, Towards dark descents and shady. Chorus. [They embrace most fervently, and the scene closes. Scene 4. In the country, not far from the seat of war. Room in the chÃ¢teau of Mdlle. Villiers. Beatrice alone. She rises and paces the room. She speaks, while continuing her walk. Nearer to him! Well, that is something perhapsâ But nearer also to all fateful dreams, Closer to terror both by night and day. Heaven, how I love him! He will never knowâ Neverâno never through this wretched life Of weary days and miserable hours How once a woman loved his very soul. Aye, his sweet soulâI saw it in his face, Transfigured as with sorrow and with love, The day he left meâleft me! When I drove, Hurled, hunted rather, his true heart away. I saw his very soulâand it was sweet. Oh, brave, true spirit of one brave, noble man, What has a woman lost, who thus has lost The priceless, full possession of thyself? No other soul will love mineâno true heart Thus beat for me with bounding, joyous throbs. I crawl a lonely woman to my graveâ Lonelyâa grievous, miserable woman; A poor, sick-hearted, feeble, wan-cheeked woman. Lonely, sick, wan-cheekedâfor what is a woman Without the flush upon her cheeks of love? What is she but a desolate, sorry flower, Pale by the waysideâwhite upon a bank, With petals that the wild wind tears and blows Far over meadows, topping eerie cliffs, Out to the sunless breakers of despair? Or if love comes, it may be wounded loveâ Love flushed, indeed, but flushed with pain of scars, Smitten by swords; rose-redâbut thus from battle. Oh, love, my darling! here am I, but what, What can I do? A woman may not help Till warriors need her in the last extreme; She may not fightâshe is not called until Death stands with her at the forlorn bedsideâ Then is she sent forâcomplimented, perhaps, Upon her courage or her gentle handsâ So swift in ministry, so soft in tendanceâ This she may do, but nothing, nothing more. The dying spirit she may soothe and bless, But only help the living at a distance. By prayers, I think they sayâthose fittest means A woman may with decency employ, But other means she may not: far away, Sitting at home, she marks the sound of battle, But may not help a lover till that lover From head to foot streams, tideway-like, with blood. Ah, God, why may not women fightâfor France: For Franceâmy lovely France of flowers, to-day? Why may not I, an English maiden, draw A steel-blue brand, like passionate Joan of Arc, And strike for very love of this sweet land As glorious and as virginal a blow? Ah, madâmost wildâunwomanly, no doubtâ Here come the tears that do unnerve the arm: Men must be strong because they cannot weep. Yet have I that within meâa live fire Of love for France and âsome oneâ inter-mixedâ Which, had I but the chance, would urge me on, A maiden breast amid the maiden steel, Force me to mingle, singing, with the mass Of surging combatants, and sting my soul Into hot, blood-stained action, till my palmâ This palm my lover called the lily-palm, The very flower of liliesâwhite no longer, Became an orange lily, or a rose, Streaked from war's spouting waterfalls of blood. Oh, Iâthe English maiden, young and fair, And soft and sweet and simpleâwith the eyes That men write sonnets toâoh, I could dance Along the glittering rows of armed men; Laugh with the laughter of the combatants, Charge with the neighing horses, white with foam, Yearn with the yearning spirit of battleâsmite Till twenty foes before my feet lay dead. Then turn and greet my lover with a kiss That should be soft as ever, albeit my lips Might kiss an alien crimson to his mouth. For all the rapture and the ecstacy That ride like laughing gods upon the waves Of battle or of any strenuous deed A womanâtrust meâcan appreciate more, Can enter into more than any man. A man but acts; a woman thinks and loves, Ponders, takes heed, lays up within her heart. The mirthful ecstacy of mingled swords, Could but a woman fight, she would enjoy Far more than any manâsince in one stroke Her soul would love some lover, and would smite Some enemy of that fair lover dead: For woman is all soul, and wholly love. Buoyant like some fair rose upon the waves Of rippled, sanguine battle she would ride With heart the whiter as her hands waxed red, And soul the softer and the more intent Upon the tender ways and dreams of love, As all her bright face gladdened and took fireâ Yea, all the perfume of her inmost spirit Would float like odours from the trampled flowers Above the battle-field, and make the spot, Before so hideous with entangled wrath, Like Love's fair dwelling-placeâlike Love's soft bower. Ah, me, too muchâI dreamâI dreamâI dream. [She sinks, exhausted with her passion, upon a chair near one of the windows, and looks out over a beautiful country view. She sees soldiers approaching, bearing a wounded man on a litter. What? is the old sick terror coming true? Ah! fighting, battle, wrath, and crimson hands Of urgent maidenâwhere, where are ye now? I am again a woman. I am afraid! [A pause. They come nearer. The figure and the faceâwhy do I tremble? Oh, Edward! Edward! Edward! is it thou? Oh, all my strength forsakes me. [She clutches a chair wildly.âKnocking at the door outside and confusion.âShe rings violently.âTo the servant. Bring that man here. Servant. âYes, my lady. [Soldiers enter with litter. Wounded Officer. âBeatrice! Bea. âEdward! [End of sceneâwhich closes dramatically, on the contrast between Beatrice's lonely impassioned war-utterances and her natural sweeter feminine terror at the sight of her lover, pale and wounded. Scene 5. The same room in the chÃ¢teau.âBeatrice and the Officer alone together. She is working or reading by his side; he is resting on a sofa, still weak from his wound, but evidently much better. His face, however, is still heavenly bandaged and a good deal concealed. Bea. âBut so soon, Edward? Off. âIt is not soon, when one is in loveâor in hate. Bea. âIn hate! you never used to talk about hate, Edward; that is a new word from you, surely. [He is slightly confused, but quickly recovers himself. Off. âAh! but one learns all about hate in fighting, you see; the sword soon teaches. Well, you have driven me to this miserable war; you said âWill you fight for me?â and I said âYes,â and now I have fought for you and for France sufficiently I think, having very nearly got killed in doing it, and I want my reward. You promised, you know; will you give it me? I have got well with wonderful rapidity through your good nursing, and it is perfectly evident also that, though I am so much betterâquite well enough to be married in factâI shall not be of any more use in this war at all events. France must fight her own battles now, without the aid of my sword-arm, whatever that may be worth. Love, when will you marry me? To-day? Bea. âTo-day! Perfect simpleton! Of all goosey men I think you are the most goosey! A silly baby! You forget about dress and preparations, and orange blossoms, and blossoms of bridesmaids and friends, and a big snow-topped wedding-cakeâthe most indispensable adjunct of all, from a lady's point of viewâandâandâand all sorts of things! Off. âWell, as to the dressing, you have done enough of that in dressing my wound so tenderly and efficiently, I think (he kisses her); and as to the orange-blossoms, are there not flowers enough in the garden (he looks from the window) âbesides your own lips, the softest blossoms of all? Bea. âNonsense! there must be better blossoms than those, to make anything of a wedding. Still, the circumstances are exceptional, and I am ready to take into my earnest consideration, sir, your somewhat alarming proposal. I owe you a good deal, I admit (speaking very earnestly, and looking towards him tenderly, her eyes filling with tears), for my silly girlish conduct in Paris, and I am anxious, love, to make what reparation I can. I do want to make you happy. Off. âIt lies in your power to do that, very easily. Bea. âI will do what you tell me. Make me do what you want. You must carry me off by force, like the strong lovers of oldâlike Queen Mary and Bothwell. I shall pretend to tremble, and hate you, and resist; but you must not mind that, you know, that will be all nonsense. Make me marry you. Off. âGood, sweet. You shall marry meâI like this game and I flatter myself I can play well at it! (this half aside). You shall marry me to-morrow! Bea. âSir, you will not be a very charming husband, nor have you, let me tell you, been a very lovely suitor, with your head all bandaged up and hidden in that way, and all scarred too! (Passing from laughter and badinage to a more tender mood) âI am sorry they have hurt you and spoilt you so! Do you know you are very ugly now, and you used to be so handsome: sometimes I hardly recognise you. (He starts perceptibly). What is the matter? Off. âOnly my wound, dear. It twitches a good deal sometimes. Bea. âSometimes I hardly know you, and the priest when he marries usâyes, to-morrow, if you like, you most violent and reckless and foolish of loversâthe priest when he marries us, will hardly be able to see your face. You are not a pretty lover! Off. âYou are handsome enough for both. I am satisfied. Bea. âAm I so handsome still? Ah, Edward, I have suffered a great deal in this short time, since we met in Paris, and suffering has taught me much. I feel so old! Off. âYou will be young and happy again soon, darling. I will make you happy. The time to which I have looked forward all my life with great throbs of intense passion has come at lastâat last. Kiss me. (She leans over his couch and obeys). END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 2. Scene 1. Beatrice is walking in the garden of her villa, near the seat of the war. The house is behind: over a low fence, or ha-ha, she looks towards a long dusty French road, straight, rigid, bordered by poplars. She soliloquizes: Strange, but to-day I feel a deep depression. The air is bright, the garden flowers are sweet, No more disastrous news has yet arrived From the army. My dear husband is in Paris, Recovered quickly from his dangerous wound, Or nearly so. Would he had ta'en me with him: A sad and dark foreboding fills my soul; I feel as if ill news were in the wind. And yet what further ill news can there be Now that my Edward, safe and sound, has passed Far from the bitter peril of this war, Yet without loss of honour? true, these battles So fierce and sanguinary, fill the soul Of one who loves sweet France, as I her daughter Do love her, with a horror wide, far reaching. But there is hope they tell me, grand hope yet, That all may be retrieved with final honour. It is not for my France, I feel to-day, These doubts, this dismal load of weighty care. [She stoops and plucks a flower. Oh, little blossom, little tender blossom, I'm lonely here, be thou a sweet companion. [She blows off the petals, one by one, her eyes filling with tears. Go thou and find my husband, where he dwelleth, Go thou, go thou. Fly little quivering petal, With soft wings floating through the country air, Over broad fields towards all the din of Paris. Tell him I love him, long for him; that roses Here in the country, tender roses, yearn For his glad coming, pine for his return. [She raises her eyes towards the country. Yet, this tall figure glittering in the distanceâ [Shading her eyes with her hand. His seat is like my husband's in the saddle. His form is like my husband's; but he comes From the direction of the recent fighting. The Paris road is on the other side. My husband went in weakness too, yet bent From the remaining trouble of his wound. [Her face flushes, and she becomes greatly agitated. Of course it is my husband thoughâof course; He's not been long away; why am I troubled? Quiet, wild heart! I'll to the gate to meet him! [Scene shifts to the gate. Beatrice standing there alone; the rider approaching. He dismounts at a little distance from the gate, gives his horse to an attendant, and approaches her. She stares at him wildly. My husband! Ray. âHusband! not yet; Edward Raynor Hopes to deserve that title. 'Tis a time, However, to put pleasant hopes aside. See, I am stained with dust and gore of battle. Our armyâthe French armyâis defeated; Aye, bitterly defeated, sweet; wrecked, routed, Destroyed I might have saidâbut not dishonoured. I cannot tarry; 'tis not safe for you. The Germans in the madness of their victory, Hot with the frenzy of a fierce pursuit, Will presently be here. This quiet garden Will soon be trampled by the invaders' steeds, And roses, not as theseâhot, sanguine roses, Roses of brave men's outpoured blood, will redden. The sound of battle has not reached you here? Oh, tender oasis within the desert: Would, lady-love, that I might linger here. [For the first time he takes note of her bewilderment, having been too excited and intent upon his story to do so before. Bea. (she murmurs, pale as death) âGood God; two husbandsâtwo! Ray. âWhy, sweet, what is it? [He approaches nearer, and would embrace her. She, trembling from head to foot, motions him away. Good heaven! she does not know me. Beatrice, darling, Surely you know your lover, Edward Raynor? When your sweet scorn refused my suit in Paris; When you, love, taunted me with want of courage, With want of love for your adopted land, I swore to falsify the bitter words. So, by some influence then at my disposal, Gained a commission in the brave French army; Hastened to meet the frowning wave of war, Fought, laboured, suffered. Lastly, here I am. I heard, by merest accident, that you Were all alone within this dreary chÃ¢teau; I heard no more. Bea. âOh, EdwardâEdwardâEdward! [Drawing out each word with a long sob. Go; you must go. I cannot, cannot tell you. Leave me for ever, and all thought of me. I do not change, but fate has come between us. I am married. Ray. âMarried! Bea. âMarried. Ray. (He changes his tone.) âMarriedâto whom? Bea. âI do not knowâto you. To you in spirit, surely; for I married Your name, your face, your seemly whole appearance. A wounded officer came to my chÃ¢teauâ Cameârather he was carried on a litter; We took him in, attended to his wounds, For he was youâyouâyouâyes, Edward Raynor. His face was yours; his voice was yours; he isâ He is, and you are not, my lord and husband. Ray. âThen, who am I? am I not Edward Raynor? You speak to me; you call me Edward Raynor. Bea. âI know you. Yes, you are my true first lover. Ray. âBut, sweet, the wild mistake! were you not dreaming? Bea. âDreaming! my life will ever be a dream. Ray. âBut you are mine; you married him not knowing. Bea. âYet are the oaths of marriage firm and sure. Ray. âGood God! my Beatrice, you cannot mean To tarry true to untruth. Let me find him; This sword is red with German blood already; Now let it pierce the dark soul of a traitor. Bea. âMy husband's soul? Ray. âWhy, IâI am your husband. Bea. âHe is my husband. Ray. âNay, my sweet, he is not; You grow confused, no wonder, with this madness: Let a man's mind, a man's sword, cut the knot. I'll go and find this paragon in Paris. You shall be free; we will be free again. You married the pale ghost of Edward Raynor; The ghost is deadâhere Edward stands himself. Bea. âWhat makes you guess my husband is in Paris? Ray. âSurely he is not here? That news were good, Too good. I simply guessed the villain, hearing Of the approach of my divisionâknowing, As he would know, most surely, our engagement, Had fled beforehand, to escape this visit. But, now, get ready, love; we must away. Bea. âIt cannot be; no, Edward, I must meet him, Meet him alone. You must return without me. [A noise and shouting in the village. Ray. âThe Prussians! Lady fair, there is no choice. Bea. âCome, then; let us lie hidden in the chÃ¢teau. These Germans will not long be in the village; It has been sacked already by the French. [They pass quickly towards the house. Scene 2. The Village.âPrussian Soldiers and French Peasants. Prussian Soldier (1) (to French Peasant, who is vainly trying, or pretending to try, to catch a pig). âNow then, Donner und Blitz, you damned French cochon, can't you even catch your own pig! you slow-footed, lumbering, slumbering, frog-breederâstir your lagging timbers. [Another Soldier prods the Frenchman with his bayonet, who gesticulates wildly. Prussian Sergeant. âGently, gently. A good battle, a brave battle; the hills about Worth and Speicheren were well washed in the fresh French red wine when we won our first victories, and now we're treading the juicy grapes all through the fields of France. There's much German blood shed, tooâalas! alas! Soldier (2). âWhat shall we do with this prisoner? (Hauling a small French soldier up and down by the collar). âShoot him against the barn door there? I think he was a spy; he may stand and drop for a spy at any rate; uniforms and scarlet breeches don't go for much on such a day as this. Put him up against the barn door, I say. He looks for all the world like a Cochin China cock with his baggy trousers. Come along, comrades. [While the Sergeant is occupied with some pigs and fowls, they put him up against the barn door, and prepare to shoot him: he curses them in bitter guttural French. Just before they fire, in rushes Amine, the maid of the village, a very pretty French girl; she fixes her eyes on the French soldier, recognises him, and exclaimsâ Ah, Gustave, Gustave, my love. (She rushes towards him, embraces him, throws her body in front of him, endeavouring to shield him with her arms. The Prussian soldiers look on and laugh. The French soldier is pale, but resolute and silent. At last he speaks with emotion)â Amine, Amine, darling, this is no place for you. Goâgo, I beseech you, go, for my sake. What does it matter about me? Go. Am. âWhat, go! and leave you to be shot? Gustave, you are a Frenchman, but you don't understand a French woman, a French girl, even yet. Go and leave you! Ah! my Gustaveâpoor silly, silly Gustave. Gus. âPoor silly, silly Amine, you can do no good. Go, to your mother, give her my love. Tell her I died as no base spy, no foul German coward. (Looking towards the Germans with unutterable hatred and contempt). But as a true soldier; a true lover of France, and ofâAmine. And tell my father the sameâmy father, far away in the little cottage that looks on the vineyardâ what is he doing, I wonder? What will he do when he hears? What, Amine, you will not go? Then (rising to his full height) I order you to go. You promised you would always obey me. Am. âI will not obey you. I will not go. Gus. âBut I shall be angry, sweet one. Good God! they will have no mercy. I tell you to go. Am. âAnd I say I will not goânot if you told me ten thousand times. Through my maiden body they shall shoot my hero, my darling, my loverâthrough my heart, through my breast. (Hastily she throws off her shawl and neckerchief and stands in front of him, her arms extended, her eyes flashing, her bosom bare.) The Sergeant steps forward, smiling brutally âNot so badânot so bad for a French girl. (Aside to his comrades.) And as pretty a woman too, as ever I saw. What eyes now she's angry. She's the best bird in the farmyardâa peacock, all eyes and fury, is better than a goose or a fluffy fowl. (Winks at them.) Now, I'll just tell you what, young woman. You come along with usâalong with us, I say, and we'll let your lover go free. We don't care about himâscurvy French scoundrel, but youâyou're not a man, you know. Come, my darling. (He advances nearer.) [The girl turns round to her lover and kisses him. She puts her hand in her bosom. The Sergeant. âWhat, you won't come, soft and quiet, little fool. Why, I am a better looking man than your paltry private, any day of the month. (Draws himself up.) Come, boys, pull her away there, but don't hurt her white armsâtoo pretty for that. Shoot the men, and spare the women ââThe gallant they slaughtered, the lovely they sparedââyou know the old ditty. [The Soldiers advance upon Amine and her lover. Ser. âPretty red lips, they are, my dear. Don't waste them upon him, and don't begin too soon. You'll have plenty of kisses presently. Am. âFool. [As the Soldiers advance she suddenly draws out a knife, turns to her lover (who has been unable to move, being bound to the paling) kisses him passionately, and saysâ Do you remember, love, this knife you gave me? 'Twas years ago, when first you came a courting. It might be useful some dayâso you said. Its use has comeâto strike two lovers dead. [She stabs him to the heart, and then pierces her own bosom. As she falls she looks towards the Sergeant, half smiling. Poor fool! [The Soldiers gather round the bleeding bodies in some dismay, and the curtain falls. Scene 3. A Room in the chÃ¢teau.âThe Germans visible from the window, hunting about in the grounds. Beatrice and Edward Raynor together. They look from the window. Ray. âWell, Mrs. Raynor, for so I suppose I must call you, as you have been kind enough to marry me, tho' you're not my wife. I suppose the rascal had the grace to attach himself to my honourable name? Well, what are we to do now? Here we are in this room; you say the secret door which leads to it cannot fail to baffle those inquisitive wretches of Germans. By Jove! there's one of them in the garden kissing the old girl who looks after the cows; she must be at least eighty! Well chosen, German! But what are we to do? They may stay here for days. It strikes me, Beatrice, that in every point we have behaved likeâtwo English fools. It was all very wellâyour love for France. As it was your adopted countryâas you were brought up from childhood in it, and all its ways were your ways, that passionate attachment to France was not to be wondered at. But, really, to send me off to enlist; to come down to your chÃ¢teau close to the war, on some wild dream, I suppose, of being of use to the wounded; to wind up by marrying my half-brother, my chief enemy in the world (for I suppose, by the long description of the whole affair which you have been giving me, that it must be he); and now to be together in this way, likely to be starved to death in an old French chÃ¢teau. Really, the whole thing, if it were not so utterly mad and miserable, would be ludicrously absurd. What are we to do? Bea. âStay here till the Germans go. Ray. âWhen will they go? Bea. âI don't know. Ray. âAnd what are we to do, when they do go? Bea. âI don't know. Ray. âOn the whole, you seem to be in a happy state of general ignorance, Mrs. Raynor. Bea. âDon't call me that. Ray. âWhy not? Bea. âI don't like the name. Ray. âBut it is your name, surely. You chose it yourself. Bea. âChose it! Ray. âYes, chose it. He asked you something, and you answered. Bea. âWhat did I answer? Ray. âYou answered yes, I imagine, with great readiness. Bea. âBut, then, Edward, Edward, you know I thought he was you. Ray. âAnd I was him. We must mind our grammar here; it shows signs of becoming involved. Are you sure you thought that? Bea. âQuite sure. [Sounds of shouting and firing outside. Bea. âWhat a strange situation to be placed in, though. Fancy your sitting here, Edward, making love to a married woman who has married you, and yet is not your wife, with the enemy âmaking hayâ in the garden. Ray. âLet them make hay while the sun shines. That is just what I want to do whileâmy sun is shining upon me. I like making love to a married woman in the middle of a battleâespecially when she's my own wife all the time; it has a spice of unusual romance about it. Romance is everything in love. Bea. âJust so; romance, and a lot of scrambling, rambling, gambolling Germans outside, and a secret chamber. Ray. âAnd a pretty woman in it. Do you know, BeatriceâMrs. Raynor, I mean âdo you know that you're prettier than ever? Bea. âNo. Ray. âBut you are. It must be the excitement of the war, I supposeâthe Prussians and the firing outside, and all that sort of thing. Why, you are quite flushed. You are ever so much prettier than you were at that dismal last interview of ours in Paris, which sent me off to thisâ Bea. âHush! Ray. âConfounded, I was going to sayâthis confounded war. How is it, Mrs. Raynor? Bea. âAgain! (Rising, and pretending to move to the door.) If you talk in that way, sir, I'll go and join the Prussians immediately. They say some of the Prussian officers are exceedingly handsome. Do you know whether that is true? Ray. âWhy, yes, I do know. I had an encounter the other day with one, who was about the handsomest young fellow I ever saw. He nearly killed me (she visibly grows pale for a moment; starts and trembles) âpoor fellow. Bea. âAndâyou killed himâquite, I suppose? Ray. âWellâyesâI believe so. The fortune of war. It might very well have been the other way. Indeed, now you are âMrs. RayânorâI almost wish it had been so. Bea. âHush, hush, things are better as they are. Ray. âNot so. But, as I was saying, you have grown so pretty, Beatrice. Indeed, you are not pretty now; you are beautifulâa fit bride for a poet, not for a mere tongueless, imaginationless soldier. I shall begin to make verses about youâabout those wild, grey eyes of yours! Bea. âWhatever you doâdon't! Ray. âBut I willâmy beauty, my queenâI have done so already. Listen, while I sing you a song which I wrote about you one evening in camp, after a hard day's fightingâexpecting a harder day's fighting on the morrow. We were encamped, I remember, by the side of a glorious old woodâthick green trees stretching away for miles, and a stream in front. I had been washing my sword in the stream (she shudders) and afterwards I thought of you, my darling, far away from all such horrid scenes, in perfect peace and safetyâas I hopedâand I plucked a wild roseâpink as your cheeks, now they flush so sweetlyâto bring you, when the battles were over, and peace came again. There it is! (He opens the breast of his coat, takes out a dried wild rose, and flings it towards her gently. She lets it lie in her lap untouched.) And afterwards I wrote the song. And all that time, Beatrice, Beatriceâoh, Beatrice, more loved, and yet more faithless unto me than the Beatrice whom Dante worshipped of oldâall that time, while I was dreaming about you, praying for you, fighting for you and your Franceâ yes, fighting for France out of sheer love for you, being an Englishman, and not in any way concerned in this country's peevish and petty quarrels myselfâwhile I was doing and suffering all this, not altogether as I hope ignoblyâyouâyouâthe joy of my life, the flower of my dreams, the pride of my heartâyou were calmly marrying my worst enemyâpleasantly and profitably occupied in ruining your own life and mine for ever and ever! Oh, Beatrice, I have a great mindâindeed I haveâto break this cursed sword once and for all that has brought such trouble upon usâor to break it in my own body (he plays with his sword nervously) âor in yours. Shall I kill you, Beatrice? Would that bring us any nearer togetherâwould that solve our perplexed problem? Shall I kill you, Beatrice? (I have washed the sword, since it killed the last German.) Shall I dye it in richer and sweeter blood? Bea. âIf you like. But sing me that song first. Ray. âOh, oh, you've not forgotten the song? Well, well (slamming back his sword, which he had half drawn while last speaking) songs first, I suppose, and swords afterwards! 'Tis the way of women. Love-songs lead to the glitter of crossed swords often enough, I'm afraid, though. But the song, the song. [He sings. Oh, go and find my lady, And tell her when you're there, I shall die for ever loving The dark-brown hair. I shall die for ever loving The sweet short lipsâ At sight of which all former Loves sank into eclipse. I shall die for ever loving The green-grey eyesâ Pure as the depth of fountains, Soft as the sunset skies. I shall die for ever loving The snow-white handsâ Whiter than bloom of lilies In love's own mystic lands. When soul and body sunder, When life's last turrets fall, Oh then shall thy sweet wonder Be mine beyond recall. [She listens, rapt. Ray. âNow, my lady, a kiss for a true lover's true love-songâeh? [She draws back. But, why not (growing impatientâthey have both risen) âwhat possible harm is there in it? You married me, besidesâyou are my wifeâyou made all your vows to meâyou did everything except kiss me, and now I want the kiss. Come, sweet, I mean to have it. It is not the first time you have kissed your husband, gentle maidenâfrigid matron, I should say. [But she withdraws further. (He continues)âWhy, there is your picture hanging against the wall. At any rate, I'll take that down, and kiss it âinstead of its sour, frowningâbitter, cruelâunkind, perverseâthoughtless, pitiless, feelingless, coquettish, heartless (looking towards her half angrily, half humorously; she begins to sob) original. [He approaches the picture to take it down. Just as he reaches out his hand to touch it, a bullet crashes through the window, and smashes the portraitâcovering his hand with fragments of broken wood and glass. Bea. âAn omen, Edward. Fate won't let you have even the portrait, you see. It is not to be. Ray. âThe more cause, then, surely, why I should possess myself, and that as speedily as possible, of the far fairer original. But enough of words. For God's sake don't play with me any more, but tell me whatâ Bea. âHas that glass cut you? Ray. âYou mean to do. Here am Iâyour husband isâI don't know where. What is to be the end of it? Shall I kill him? Kill you? Kill myself?â orâperhaps, best of allâkill all three. I believe three deaths are lucky. Bea. âI have made up my mind. I will go into a convent. [He actually laughs out, long and heartily but bitterly. And that is to be the end of our romance, is it? But Beatrice, that won't save you. You will be married still. He will seek you there, and will have a right to do so. Perhaps he may even be able to remove you. Think of some better plan. [An old servant rushes in; he wrings his hands and criesâ Oh, my lady, my lady, your maid, Amineâthe pride of the village. She lies out there, dead, dead. And Gustave is dead too, and the Prussians have found the secret passage to this room. Flyâflyâthey will be here in a moment. [Edward and Beatrice stand bewildered. He draws his sword, and prepares himself, but, quick as lightning, she snatches it from him, and flings it out of the open window. No, Edward, not for my sake; not yet. I know your thought, but it is needless. There is an officer of repute here (looking from the window), I know him by sight. We will yield ourselves prisoners quietly to him. Ray. (folds his arms). âThere is no help for it. [Prussians with officer enter. They yield. Prussian Officer. âI fear, madam, that you will have to be separated. My orders are imperative. You shall be treated with every courtesy, but I may have to set a guard over the chÃ¢teau for a time, and confine you to your apartments, lest you communicate with the enemy. Ladies have done so before now, and that with no inconsiderable success. But I will order my troops to keep out of the way as much as possible, and to offer no violence whatever to your servants; that your rooms may be quiet and private. I regret deeply the plundering of the village, and the outrages performed there: it was all done by an advanced guard of my soldiers, under insufficient officership. They were hot and furious from some unusually hard fighting, too, which must be their excuse. We Germans do not wish to earn a name in history for rapine and pillage. The English journals have been hard and bitter enough against us already, and very often without any adequate cause. But then the chief delight of the English now-a-daysâit used not to be soâis to sit by inactive while hard fighting is going on, and then to complain peevishly of the conduct of both combatantsâa feeble and poor-spirited course of action, as it seems to us. Bea. âSir! I am an Englishwoman. Prussian Off. âA thousand pardons. I did not know it, or I should not have spoken so freely. Yet I think there is truth in what I have said. However, now that I am here in person, there will be no more violence offered to the villagers; thorough discipline will be at once restored. And this gentleman (turning towards Raynor) is he too a wandering Englishman, perversely fighting for Franceâhaving got tired of partridge-shooting and pheasant-shooting at home? His face is English. Ray. âYes, I am English, and a prisoner now, I suppose? Prussian Off. âA prisoner, certainly. If wandering Englishmen will enter the armies of other countries, through sheer love of fighting (Or love of woman. Ray. aside to Beatrice), they must expect to be occasionally taken prisoner; occasionally even shot. You will have to be sent to the rear, and thence to Germany. (To his Soldiers.) Take charge of this officer. Let him be treated with every respect, and conveyed to the rear as speedily as possible. Beatrice to Raynor (both advancing towards the front of the stage). With musicâ And so we part againâis it not sad, This little time Fate gives us to be glad? Ray.- Yea, lady, yet I part not in despair, One comfort have Iâ'tis that thou art fair. Bea.- The old poor comfort that a woman gives, She grants no strength beyond this, while she lives. Ray.- But 'tis enoughâenough for life and timeâ One comfort wholly perfectâlarge, sublime. Bea.- Whatâcomfort just to know a blossom blows? Ray.- Yesâwhen one's heart is wrapt within the rose! Bea.- Comfort to watch a flowerâthen pass away? Ray.- The flowers of true love fade not, nor decay. Bea.- True love is baffled ever; sorrow it brings. Ray.- Nay, rather, pleasure on resplendent wings. Bea.- True love is insufficient fate to dare. Ray.- True love is conquerorâsweet love is fair. Bea.- True love shall join us surely in the end. But now, farewell, eternal, noble friend. Your song I have, I learnt it as you sung, By heart I know itâaround my heart it clung, My soul with joy yet bitterness it stung. Ray.- Farewell! farewell! oh heart so sweetâso young. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 3. Scene 1. House of the Sisterhood at Oxford. Near the Church of St. Philip and St. James, on the Woodstock Road. Garden of the Nunnery.âBeatrice in nun's attire, walking in it, in close conversation with two other nuns, Mary and Dorothea. Bea. âSix years have passed. I have not seen him yet. Long, long ago they seemâthose burning days Of August, when the sunstruck Eastern plains Of France were bright with blossoms tinged with blood. Long, long ago it seems, that weary tale That I have told youâMary, Dorothea, That you have listened to with gentle ears, Giving me hope and comfort as is meet. I trust that I have conquered earthly love! That all the base alloy of earth is purged, Yea, truly purged from meâthat now my hope Is fixed alone on righteous deeds and heaven. You know my story, girls, my sister nunsâ My soft, good-hearted sisters; it was strange, Now was it not, in this cool, quiet garden, To hear of deeds so desperateâpassion mad And fierce and bitter; of the loss of love, And utter ruin of all hope on earth? But now there is a higher crown awaiting My earnest toils and prayers, than any crown, Be it ne'er so bright, never so sweet, of love. That crown awaits me, and I am content. [She pauses. Yet think not, think not that I have forgotten My joy, my hope, my early spirit's love: Be patient, loveâyea, glorious love of lovesâ So said I, in a wild, delicious dream To him, one nightâto him, to him, to him. Be patient, love of loves, eternal love. Be patient, crown of crownsâand we shall meet. Mary. âYou dream of him, then, Beatrice? Bea. âIs that right? You would go on to sayâyea, right it is; Or rather 'tis not right, but something moreâ Far moreâfar more than any paltry right Of earthâit is the holiness of heaven. The priests, who would disparage love to us, Flinging their epithets of âcarnal,â âbase,â Around it, hiding it as in a veil Of common coarseness, woven by themselves At their imagination's vicious loom, They are the base, the carnalâlove is pure. Yea, love is pure as is the peerless sun Above us, or the solemn stars by night, Pure as the round orb of the sacred moon That floats amid the azure depths supreme, Pure as these lilies in the garden here; These buds of pinks, these roses; sweet and pure, Oh flowerâsweet, flowerâpure maidens, as yourselves. Never let any fool disparage love. Love is the strengthener of earthly life, And the bright herald at the heavenly gates To guide with triumph towards fair lands unseen. I give up love in this life: many do, But 'tis because I will not give up love. It is because I hold the gift of love So high, so sacred, kingly and supreme, That, rather than by over-hasty touch And avaricious snatching premature Break the bright crystal bowl of passion, we Would wait that sweet gift for ten thousand years! So sweet the perfect perfume of the rose Of passion is, that here it cannot be With full fruition perfectly enjoyed. I give up love to win loveâto obtain In fullest bloom the very flower I yield; To win the crown fools think I would destroy. Dorothea. âBut lady, if your love came again, Yea, rode with clatter of his sword and spurs, Right by our walls, along the Woodstock road, How would it fare with dreams of heavenly love? Would heavenly love abide his coming long? Would he not slay those sad dreams with his sword, This gallant soldier you have told us of? And carry you off to Woodstockâbuild a bower For his, perhaps, far fairer Rosamond there, And leave us poor nuns to inherit heaven? Mary. âOh, Dorothea, Dorothea, love, How can you talk so wildly. Beatrice Is shocked, I see it in her tender face! Bea. âNay, darling, not shocked, hardly shocked at all. But pained a little, startled at the thought For I had given him up. I never dreamed That here in life I should behold again The nodding plumeâthe swordâthe clinking spurs; [Her face shows that her mind has gone back strongly to the past. The noble, honest and trustworthy face; Nor will it be in earth-life, as I think. Besides the wars are overâne'er again Through all the terrors of the years to come, At which the seers tremble as they glance, Never againâneverânever again, Will Edward Raynor bare the glittering sword, To dye it in the blood of foes of France. [She grows fierce and impassioned, and her face lightens. Ma. âOh, Beatrice. [She looks down at Mary half tenderly, half pityingly. The old fire came upon meâMary, love, Forgive meâchild, I must have frightened you. Ma. âYou darted out your hand as though in thought To strike. Bea. âTo strike an enemy! Old dreams Were present with meâin that bitter war I killed a man once. [Ma. and Do. are full of horror. Killed him right clean dead. He was no soldier, either French or German, No honest soldier, but a wandering thief, A scavenger of the armyâa foul knaveâ A would-be pillager of maidens' honours. He found me in the garden of the chÃ¢teau, One day aloneâall help was far away. He leapt across the low and useless hedge, And came across the flower-beds: even nowâ Now that I stand in Oxfordâeven nowâ With you two gentle, timid souls, beside, I see with horror of great startled eyes One splendid scarlet tulip that he crushed. He came towards meâquite defenceless there, I saw his purposeâfell, and black, and foulâ I saw his shameful purpose in his face, And drew a knife. I always wore one then, For due protection in those wild, wild daysâ I drew a knife, and kept it out of sight, And when he drew quite near, and put his hand, His great coarse hand, upon me with a grin, Why thenâwhy thenâI stabbed him to the heart. And all the red bright bloodâthe one pure thing He carried yet about himâsplashed the tulips. Dorothea and Mary (together) âSweet saints defend us. Bea. âSurely then the saints Defended me, or I had never dared Unmaidenly to imbrue my maiden hand E'en in defence of maidenhood, in blood. But come my children, let me calm your hearts, That flutter nowâI know itâlike the wings Of two poor startled, palpitating dovesâ Let me divert the current of your thoughts By singing you this little, gentle song I made the other day: 'tis of my loveâ I sang his song about the dark-brown hair, âDying for ever lovingââyou remember? I sang his songânow I will sing you mine. [She sings. When the same chorus comes again in the second verse the nuns look at one another, and by mutual consent, as it were, join in it. 1. âDying for ever loving.â I will live As though I had but one fair gift to giveâ My love and truth, My bloom of youth, And all sweet blossoms frail and fugitive: These will I scatter on the summer air, Loading the summer winds with blossoms fairâ Sweet gifts and plenteous for true love to wear. 2. âDying for ever loving.â Heaven is sweet, And glad the sound of love's advancing feetâ In heaven I find Joys left behind, Since evil were the plumes of fate and fleet: These will I scatter on the summer air, Loading the summer winds with blossoms fairâ Sweet gifts and plenteous for true love to wear. 3. âDying for ever loving.â I will wait, Till thro' death's odorous and rose-bound gate We pass to win Loves freed from sin, Blossoms of pearly passion delicateâ These will I scatter on the summer air, Loading the summer winds with blossoms fairâ Sweet gifts and plenteous for true love to wear. [They riseâflushed, but happily and quietlyâ Bea.- And now let us retire; there sounds the bell We sisters of sweet mercy know so well. Ma. â(solemnly)â The time is come for silence and for prayer. White blossoms now let love, awe-stricken, wear. Do. â(mischievously and archly, and half aside)â Yet those white blossoms shall be changed to red, If he but comesâher love is no more dead Than some coy maiden's, yestermorning wed. Scene 2. Mountain Scene in Switzerland. Square in front of Mountain Inn.âMountaineers and Peasants. [Enter Edward Raynor, hot and dusty, attired plainly as a Traveller. He soliloquisesâ For just six yearsâsix weary years I've tracked himâ And now, at last I've driven him to his lair. Foul traitorâall my vengeance is embittered By long delay. Now will I drag thee forth, And visit all thy crimes upon thy head With fervid interestâfull and running over. Such measure of due recompense will I Drive at the sword's point into thy base bosom. The fairest, sweetest, noblest of all women, Thou didst in thy most shameless act deceive, And I, her husband, whom she did not marry, Her lordly spirit-husband none the less, Am here for vengeanceâyea, am here for peace. Oh, holy fury, burn along my sword; Light it, wild fury, to a mastering flame, That never this weak sinner may escape Its lurid, fiery, ireful potency. I was a man six years ago. I loved, Loved gently, sweetly, simply, with delight, And now I am a fiendâa very fiend. All Satan's fire of spirit doth burn throughout These boiling channels of tempestuous veins; I feel at one with that great lord of hell, And ripe for hell's most sultry bowers myself. Oh, Satan help me! Let my good steel sword, Edged by thy wit and cunning, guided straight By thine own perfect malice, find his heart. That damned, white, bloodless, HEARTLESS heart of his. Then shall I quite be satisfiedâmy Satan, My lovely, peerless, tender-hearted Satanâ My gentle, queenly, sweet-souled, kindly Satan. My righteous lord and masterâmy true Satanâ Then shall I quite be satisfied, and led Towards thine eternal lake of fire in peace, A happy, blood-stained guiltless murderer; Divinely recompensedâsuperbly crowned. And yet those tenderer thoughts that once I held, That held me, rather, as with leash of God, God's sober and decorous guiding-reinâ Where are theyâall those tender, seemly thoughts? Gone, gone with Beatrice, my lady pure. Gone utterly, eternally o'erthrown. Ah me! her name but for a moment calms, The next it adds a winged flame to my sword, For I have never seen herânever traced Her flying footsteps since the bitter day When, 'mid the tumult and the wrath of war, We two were taken prisoners in her home. I've sought herâsought her madly, all these years; Sought her to heal me sweetly, as I sought For him to heal me by a madder draught Of red intoxicating deep revenge. Where is sheâis sheâis she? Where, oh! where? She fled the miseryâshe fled us both. She fled the bitter riddle hard to solve; Perhaps it maddened herâperhaps she died. Enoughânow all my spirit is high and fixed; Superbly competentâsupremely strong. The thought of Beatrice, and her sweet face, And her sweet weeping eyes, and her sweet laugh, Half tender and half timid (so it seemed Upon that last most sweet and mournful day, When in the secret chamber of the house In Franceânot truly secret in the endâ We laughed and wept, and talked as lovers talk, And half forgot the present bitter fact, And half forgot the bitterness to be): Her eyes, her laugh, her tender timid face, Tender for me, and timid as for him, Himâhimâthe murderer of her young life, The man who stained its smooth angelic white Into a crimson horror, yea, who stained Two lives, white, hopeful, happyâinto red; Her eyesâher laughâcome back to me and tear All lingering shreds of pity from my heart, Making it rigid as an iron sword. For woman, sweet as honey in herself, Or sweet as new-born roses bright in May, Softer than lily-buds or buds of vines, Sheâsoft and smooth and gentle, hath the power, By the oppressive presence of her face That hangs above a man in distant dreams As though he felt the fragrance of her breath And her immediate beautyâshe hath the power To turn a man's heart into waves of flame Against a rival, bitter and perturbed Just in proportion as her breast is soft, And all the dreams she sendeth soft and sweet. Enough of dreaming; let me meet my fate. [He knocks at the door of the Inn. Is Monsieur James Wilson staying here? Innkeeper. âMonsieur James Wilson? yes, sir. He is out, however; he has gone on an excursion up the mountain towards the Black Pass. He will be back, doubtless, this night. Can I give any message for Monsieur? Ray. (hesitates). âA message!âno thank you; I think not. Which way do you say he wentâwhen did he start? Inn. âHe started early this morning to go round by the Valley of Passy, past Montrey, and back by the Black Pass. Ray. âAnd when will he reach the Black Pass? Inn. âAbout three o'clock this afternoon. Ray. âAnd how far is it from here? Inn. âSome six or seven miles, Monsieur. Ray. âThank you, my good friend (putting money into the Innkeeper's hand); I will start at once, and meet him on his way home. Inn. âBut it is a lonely and desolate place, Monsieur, and a long way, Monsieur; and the snow, they say, is very dangerous, just now. Will not Monsieur have a conveyance? Will not Monsieur, at least, take something to eat and drink before starting? We have here some most excellent cheese of GruyÃ¨re, and the best red wine in the country. Will not Monsieur honour us by partaking? The lady my wife is within; she will be saddened if Monsieur departs uncherished. Ray. âThank you, no, my friend. (Aside.) Red wineâyesâbut it shall be bright as blood! [Exit Raynor. Inn. (looks at the money and chuckles). âHoly Mary! preserve these Englishmen âwith their pink cheeks and legs of ironâand send us plenty of them. They pay well, always walk, and eat nothingâexcept now and thenâand then, when they do eatâSacrÃ©!âthey eat your whole houseful of food at one sitting, and swear if you don't give them more. SacrÃ©! [He enters the Inn. Scene 3. The Black Pass in the Mountains.âEnter Raynor from one side. Snow is seen all round, and rocks and precipices. The spot is most desolate. In the distance a winding path is seen for many miles. He speaks. âA lonely spot, and fit to freeze the vengeance Right out o' the heart of man; it is so cold. It shall not freeze the vengeance out of mine; Not if yon snowy mass that totters there Should tremble and descend and bury me And all those rocks in multitudinous ruinâ Not even so would I forego revenge. There is a fire within me that would melt The deepest masses of opposing snow. The face of Beatrice would pierce the dark, 'Twould blossomâa red rose amid the white Piled scentless heaps, and urge me on toâFury! Hell! thunder! there he is; am I mistaken? Surely I know the figure like my own, That rides along the winding mountain-path, As I once rodeâin figure like to himâ Towards Beatrice. I'll wait him here, for when He turns that rugged corner, he will see me. [A pause. He sees meâknows meâleaves his horse and comes Towards me on foot. He, too, is anxious, perhaps, To dye the steel-blue of his blade in vengeance. He is not all a cowardânever was. Our father's blood flows in no coward's veins, Cowards we never areânot even if traitors. Now he will reach me. Beatrice, âI die, For ever loving,â should pale death be nigh! [Enter Wilson. Ray. âScoundrel! At last! Wil. âI, too, have been waiting. Ray. âNot soâyou have been flying. Wil. âI didn't want to kill you. Ray. âThe time has comeâyou know the lives you've ruined Through your strange pestilent, malicious hatred. The time has come to pay off every score. You are my brother. My own father's blood Flows in your veins. A fratricidal act It is to kill you; but I mean to kill you. Wil. âAnd I have somewhat also to revenge. Your fatherâtender, humourous brother mineâ With that same tender humour, I suppose, And that same high regard for proper self, Which you show in such eminent degree, Ruined my mother, for his casual pleasure, Before he saw the splendid beauty you Called motherâwhose high beauty has descended On youâwhose roses burn upon your cheeks, But redder now this strenuous anger flames, Incarnadining all the pink thereon. A truce to jestingâlet us get to work! We were always meant to kill each other, Edward; And now I own your wife, there's double cause. Prime vengeance that wasâworthy, worthy vengeance; Most excellent and most divine revenge. Your father left my mother. She, sad heart, Died miserably in Paris; the only soul On this wide earth that Iâin sorrow born, And hardly sane, they sayâhave ever loved. But her I did love, and my love became A fire of vengeance, like your love for her On whom I would have wreaked a sweet revenge Had she not fled and hidden herself past finding. Ah! would I not have sorely punished her For all your father's cruelty and yours? Would I notâin strange, cunning, bitter waysâ Have been the monster of her married life; Making that lifeâas bitter husbands can When versed in all the intricacies of sinâ Making that life a hopeless, joyless burden. Your eyes flashâso did mine, with joy o' the thoughtâ With joy to think that those red lips of hers Went kissing mine, and lingering over them As flowers kiss flowers, waved by the summer windâ All by mistake; dreaming that I was you. Oh! glorious vengeance; but I had better still In store. I would have told her her mistake, And kept her bound yet closer in the thrall Of wifehood; made her kiss me, hating me; Bent her fair body to my every whim; Yeaâtortured her as masters when they please Far in the South, or tyrants in the East, Can torture with their passion wild, perverse, The tender, yielding body of a slave; Some fair Circassian, or some soft Quadroonâ Having upon her mastery unquestioned. Oh! would I not have made the fair eyes weep, The fair lips languish, and the fair tongue spell Hard lessons that my cruelty designed, Till all her spirit was broken, and she felt The near approach of deathâfrom which, by some New spell, I would have wakened her for fresh Access of lavish misery. Ray. âOh! wretch! What stays me now from killing you in the speech? Only the thought of your sad mother perhaps, A revelation new to meâthe thought That, as the rumours told you, you are mad! But peace between us now there cannot be; No peace till one at least of us is dead. SwordsâpistolsâWilson; which is it to be? [Offering both. Choose quickly for (looking round hastily and uneasily) a storm is in the air. [Thunder and wind. The sky darkens. Wil. âPistolsâthey are the fitter for our work. Here in this Alpine solitude we need Not fear, lest interruption mar our pleasure. Pleasure I sayâfor labour it is not. [Bowing politely and sarcastically towards Raynor. We need not fear the cunning-eyed, quick police, So jealous now, and swift to interfere When gentlemen would settle debts of honour. We need not seek some petty border townâ Some valley hidden from the keen-eyed Mayor Or Provost of the district: here indeed, Amid the rocks and snow-wreaths we are safe. I have some pistols in my holstersâthanksâ [Declining those which Raynor offers for him to choose from. They are good, I doubt not: I prefer my own. I'll fetch them while you load and look to yours. Each with his own true weapon let it be. We have no cursed blundering seconds here To bother about the pistols; mark and choose And portion out a similar tool to each, Teasing the very air with quips and fancies, While Death is languishing to grasp his prey. A duel Ã  outrance, doubtless (Raynor bows quietly). So I thought. [Wilson moves off towards his horse. Raynor looks up to the sky (now very black and threatening) and the mountains. He draws a deep sigh. At lastâat last! the holy time has come. Now, Beatrice, thou art to be avenged! Here in this fierce abode of rocks and snow I do remind myself of garden lawns In summer, and of roses budding nearâ Sweet, gracious roses, perfect in pure bloomâ Sweet, tender roses, delicate in scentâ I do remind and pierce my soul with these, Yea, with the thought of theseâthat mercy come Not now with piteous wings of soft intent Between my purpose and my bitterest foe. I arm myself with malice; put away All peevish, charitable woman's thoughts, All thoughts of love and pardonâdreams of Godâ Desires of purity and hopes of heaven. All hints of mercyâfeminine resolvesâ Longings unconqueredâyearnings unsuppressedâ Aspirings foolishâintuitions frail. All these I do abolish and consume In one wild flame of vengeance that shall leap Upon him as a lion roused from sleepâ Upon him as a tiger from its lair. Oh, sweet face, lost to meâsweet face so fairâ Now will I bring thee a blood-red crown to wear! [Wilson has reached his horse, which is at some little distance, near or under an overhanging rock. He fumbles in the holsters for the pistols, takes them out and examines them. He, presently, fires one off, thinking that the priming may be damp, in order afterwards to reload it. His horse is startled at the explosion, which rings loudly among the echoing rocks, and plunges furiously. The leaping of the frightened horse and the reverberations of the air from the shot, together, bring down the avalanche trembling overhead. It descends with an awful crash, and, sweeping away both Wilson and the horse, hurls them over the precipice, burying them besides in vast heaps of snow at the bottom. [Raynor gazes; astounded and in terror. Good God! [After a time he slowly, and dropping first his weapons, advances to the edge of the precipice; falls on his hands and knees and looks over. After a time he rises, and faces the audience. No hopeâthe heaped-up mass is far beneathâ Enough to bury a city in itselfâ And there's the fall besides! That fall would kill A giant. Even Prometheus could not stand it! But I will to the villageâsend up helpâ At any rate they may regain the bodiesâ But hope of life there is notâcannot be. And this is vengeance; now she is avenged, But not by meâby the stroke of Fate itself. Ah, God! Thy ways are wonderful indeed, Beyond our knowing, and beyond our thought. [Takes up the swords and breaks themâflings the pistols over the precipice. Away, base weaponsâye are poor, indeed; Poorâvulgarâpaltry; despicable things, Before the instruments which God most high Uses to carry out His purposes. Oh, Beatrice! it may have been some prayer Of thine which, flying through this icy air Towards God's pure throne, delivered me from sin; Thy pardon and His grace I now may win. To me the glory of the grace divine Is one thing, lady gentleâone with thine; And now my soul before this awful fact Gathers new clearnessâfresh desire to act. [Sky begins to clear, gently. I will be pure as thou artâin the end Thou shalt rejoice that thou hast called me friend. [He departs towards the village.âScene closes. Scene 4. A room in the Convent at Oxford. Mary, Dorothea, Beatrice. [When the curtain rises they are all three singing togetherâ Bright pure morningâthoughts it brings Fairer than of earthly things. Thoughts of heaven, where no pains are; Thoughts of lands past sun and star, Hopes of joys that no sins mar. Chorusâ Bright pure morningâthoughts it brings Fairer than of earthly things. Gleams it gives us, too, of life Not dividedârent by strife; Crowns it hints at, passing pure, Garlands woven to endure, Wreaths decay shall not obscure. Chorusâ Bright pure morning, &amp;c. Pleasures there are far beyond Earthly joys tho' these be fondâ Flowers no earthly bud can show Likeness toâmore white than snow, Richer than a rose's glow. Chorusâ Bright pure morning, &amp;c. For sweet heaven we hope and wait, Patient watchers round its gate. For a morning grand indeedâ For the weary watchers' meedâ For those crowns of which we read. Chorusâ This pure morning doth beget Thoughts of bright dawns fairer yet. Dor. (Jumping up quickly, and running to the window). âWhat a beautiful morning it is though. Too bright for singing. Oh, Beatrice! do you know there are soldiers in the townâofficers, tooâ such beauties! I saw them yesterday âCavalry. They are passing through to new quarters. Such beauties. Red and gold and blue. And such long spurs. Mar. âLong swords, you mean. Dor. âNo; long spurs; and the loveliest moustaches. There was one in particular âa fair man, with bright eyes âhe looked up here in passing, and I waved my hand to him. I fancy he likes nuns. I hope so. Bea. âOh, Dorothea! you are utterly incorrigible. You should go out into the world, my dear, and take your fill of flirting, dancing, &amp;c. You were never meant for a nun. Dor. âI am none so foolish, dear; am I? Well, we are only in on trialâon approval ââon sale or return,â so to speak. Our novitiate will be soon over, and thenâthenâ Mary. (From the window). âHere they come. [Beatrice and Dorothea move to the window. Dor. âOh, the beautiesâwhat lovely horses and men. They are leaving Oxford this morning, I fancy. Probably they are on their way to Woodstock. If so, they will pass under our window. Yes, now they are coming. Mary. âI don't like them much. They look so bitter and bloodthirsty, with those long, swinging swords. Dor. âStuff!âmere goose-talk, my child. You were evidently made to pass your life as a sequestered nunâhidden, like fair Rosamond, in some pleasing solitude âonly with the love and the lover left out; or only a beetle-browed priest for a lover, and the dullest possible hymn-tunesâ Mary. âOh, Dorothea, remember what we have been singing. Dor. âI do, child, remember it all too well, and that is just why I speak. As I was going to sayâwith the dullest possible hymn-tunes for songs and love-sonnets. Howeverâ(shrugs her shoulders contemptuously). Mary. âBut, Dorothea, those hymns are lovely. Dor. âLovely, child! Perhaps they areâto you. But then, you know nothing about love. And love is the only lovely thingâto a true woman. You are not a woman yetâyou are a mere nun. You will not be a woman till you have lovedâand, perhaps, suffered. (She sighs gently; and a deeper expression than usual flits across her face). For my part, I think that the true use of those slow hymn-tunes is to make one appreciate better the swift love-tunesâwhen they come dancing and throbbing through the air, and setting all one's heart on fire. Ohâdelightful. [They have been occupied together, and have not noticed Beatrice. They now hear a smothered shriekâand at the same time the clanking of the soldiers riding past outside. [Beatrice sinks into a chair, ejaculatingâ Ah, my God! [Mary and Dorothea attend to her. Mary. âWhat is itâwhat is it? (To Dorothea) What can it be? [Dorothea runs to the window and looks out hastily at the troops. Nothing, nothing, dearâonly she has seen somebody. I understand it all. Go and get some water, and call for help âquick, quick! [Beatrice has fainted quite away. Dorothea attends to her. Mary goes and returns, bringing assistance. She gradually comes to. Clamour at the door. Heavy steps on the stairs. Servants and nuns enter. More nuns and servants below. They bring in upon a litter an officer in the uniform of an English cavalry regiment, just thrown from his horse, and evidently dying. [Mary and Dorothea rush to the door, and try to prevent them. It is obviously too late. Do. (to servants) âDon't bring him in here for heaven's sake! Is he deadâwounded âillâwhat? Has there been an accident? 1st Ser. âHe has been thrown from his horse, ma'amâit took fright at a great awkward hay-waggon, a little way down the road there, and he seems to be dying, I fear. 2nd Ser. âYes, ma'amâyes, ma'amâit is a most dreadfullest thing, to be sure; and him such an 'ansome young man, too, and full of spirit. If it had only been one of those great ugly serjeants, now, or the clumsy driver of the cart! 3rd Ser. âWe can't bring him to any other part of the house, Miss, the other rooms are occupied. Our orders were to bring him in here. It's not for long, I fancy. [The above sentences must be spoken swiftly and confusedly by the servants, as in great perturbation. Beatrice, who has recovered and has listened intently to the servants without turning round, now rises majestically and approaches the litter, her eyes fixed upon the dying man. The others instinctively recede. Dying, is that so? Then our hour has come. We shall be separated soon, to meet. Edward! [He raises his head languidly. Ah! ah!âMy love! [She approaches and kisses him on the forehead. I thought it would be in another world, But God is gracious, and he gives us this. He gives us this stray perfumed flower to pluck, Bea. âE'en in the fields of earth. Ray. (speaking with difficulty). âHe's dead. Bea.- Not by, Not by your hand, my loved oneâoh, God grant it! Ray. âNot by my hand, but by the hand of God. I sought him fiercely, sought him for long years, Bitter in vengeance, armed with furious wrath, And at the last I found him: in the snow, The cold white snow he died, but not by me. These papers, Beatrice (taking papers from his bosom and giving them to her) will tell you all. I am too weak to tell the story now; But all revenge has long since died away, Leaving the pure sweet spirit of love alone. Bea. âThank God for thatâoh! blessed be God for that! My prayer was answeredâon one dismal day I had a strong foreboding you would meet, You and my husband; well I knew your natures; And what fierce manner of contest would ensue, And then I prayedâprayed as I never prayed Before, that God would in His mercy keep My lover from blood-guiltiness, and turn The wild heart of my husband to Himself. That prayer was answeredâfor you met without The red sad stain imbruing either hand. Ray. âThat prayer was answeredânow we meet without The pangs of foul remorse to mar our joy. Yet I am dyingâdying; dying, Beatrice; I had hoped for time wherein to comfort thee; Time to plant flowers upon the soil of painâ Time to rejoiceâto laugh perhapsâto be glad. And now I am dyingâyet I die beholding The one face which through life, since first I saw it, Has reigned as perfect empress o'er my heart. Bea. âAnd my true heart, oh, lover, has been thine, Thine as thou knowest from the very first. A foolish whim compelled me to dissemble In Paris, when I drove you to the field; But if you had known, oh, Edward, if you had known The agony of her who drove you forthâ My pangs of bitterest grief, the deed being done, You would not only have forgiven me, But granted me some pity of soul besides. And then in that wild meeting at the ChÃ¢teau I yearnedâI longedâwhat can a woman do? [She sobs. But this is the true marriageâyea, the second. This is our perfect union, for our souls Were knit in holy passion from the first, And death, which seems to separate, unites. Now we are man and wife before high Godâ Death is the priest, most sacred of the train, Who brings our hands together; our strong souls Were passionately wedded years ago. Ray. âWeaker I growâthey have not brought a doctor? Bea. âThey have gone for one; he shortly will be here; Butâ Ray. âI am far beyond a doctor's helpâ Are those the words, my lady, you would say? [Looking up in her face, and half smiling. It matters little; I am well content. Bea. âAnd I am well content, because I am sure That not for long shall I be left behind. Ray. âThere is yet one thing; the giftâyou would not give; The gift of love, that cruel love denied; I am dying Beatrice, may I have it now? Bea. âSurely, my lord. [She stoops and kisses him tenderly on the lips. Ray. âOh, maiden, holy kissâ Death is worth having, for he brings me thisâ This sacred, glorious gift so long denied, This holy guerdon of a perfect bride. Now, as the body aside with pangs is rent, First is my spirit unutterably content; Sing to me Beatrice, chant some fair song, That I may die thy sweet love-thoughts among! [She sends out all except Mary and Dorothea, and beckons those two to the couch. Then she goes to the window, and gathers a large red rose from a cluster just outside. This she brings to Raynor, gives it to him, and whispers,â [Bea.] It is Iâtake it! He takes it, falls back on his pillow, and a glorified expression slowly begins to overspread his features and render them radiant. Beatrice whispers to Mary and Dorothea, and they begin to sing very softlyâ [Mary., Dor.] Rose of beautyârose of night, Now that heaven is close in sightâ Arm thy hero's heart with might. Lift his thoughts beyond the tomb, Flower, oh, flower of radiant bloomâ Lift him far from earth's pale gloom. Soon let ravished eyes behold, Sacred gateways wrought of goldâ Sights supreme as yet untold. Rose of beautyârose of red, Blossom round this sufferer's bedâ Flame about his dying head. Rose of beauty, rose supreme, Crown him with love's golden gleamâ Robe him in love's dazzling dream. Rose of perfect luscious scent, Let him now be glad, contentâ Let his joy be as God meant. Bear a woman's heart, oh flower, Tender e'en in this dark hour; Even now a healing powerâ Bear it towards himâpassion's dower. [He dies. [Mary and Dorothea sob wildly. But Beatrice flings back her long dark hair which had become loosened, and speaks. Death when it joins two loving hearts in one, Is not the dark-winged death that mortals shun, Rather a garden filled with perfect bloom Of flowers that shall outshine, outdare the tombâ Rather a joyous meeting-placeâa height Whereon the sad and lost ones may uniteâ I have found my lover; heaven shall out of sorrow Prepare the dawning of a bright to-morrowâ Love doth not vanishâ'tis the one thing sure. The one thing certainâno death can obscure That love high agony hath rendered pure And endlessâGodlikeâworthy to endure. THE END.</field>
