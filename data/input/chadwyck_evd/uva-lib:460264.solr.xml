      <field name="fulltext">TO Mr. Freeman.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis Personæ. MEN. Arcadius, Emperor of Greece, Mr Mills. Eudosius, Prince of Thrace, living in Italy, disguis'd under the name of Amintor, Mr Powel. Adrastus, his Brother, Mr Tomms. Parmenio, the Emperor's Favourite, Mr Cibber. Nicias, Captain of his Guards, Mr Thomas. Alcander, Servant to Eudosius, Sileno, a Shepherd. WOMEN.

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Plays would no more without a Prologue pass, Than City Dinner wou'd without a Grace; Like theirs too some have been so long and dull, Before you taste, your Stomachs have been full. Our Author's, to engage you for his treat, Like hungry Chaplains, shall be short and sweet. The Wits, he knows, are easy in their fare, They make the Stage their pleasure, not their care. The Criticks only like Informers sit, To witness if we pass unlawful Wit. Besides, the Poets have this hardship in't, Each tries the Metal by his private Mint. They talk of Rules, and those that break 'em scorn, Yet none more forward when it serves their turn. Good Sense and Nature ev'ry where should reign, Where these are wanting they but talk in vain. The precepts of their Art with heat they praise, But draw the vile examples from their Plays. Hard fate! if we must all their paths pursue, Or win their favour by offending you: To you bright Circle he commends his Cause, They must to him, who to the world give Laws. If Foreign Theatres, with mighty cost, Of wondrous Scenes and Decorations boast; Of opening Heav'ns, and Visions in the air, They ne're cou'd shew so many wonders there. Nor by the help of Magick or Machine, Produce such Beauties, or so fair a Scene. Tho awful terrour in your eyes appears, He less your Cruelty than Justice fears. Yet by your sentence since he lives or dies, He'll fall with Pleasure, or with Glory rise.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene an open Valley, whose Prospect is confin'd by a Mountain on one side, and Woods on the other, and the Sea at a distance forward. Aurelia, Sylvia, Phylante walking. Aur. Wak'd by the early Mattins of the Lark We leave our Down, and in this Sunny Vale Suck the fresh breezes which embalm the air. Sylv. Thus in the tedious absence of your Lord, We by variety of Sports contrive To pass those hateful minutes with delight, Which else would lag like years of want and pain. Aur. Oh! 'tis an age, 'tis ages since my eyes Fed last on his, and to my Soul convey'd Unutterable pleasure. Syl. Scarce the Sun Has thrice in yonder Ocean sunk his beams Since you beheld him, and may yet e're noon Again behold, and have him in your arms. Phyl. See there—descending from the hill I spy A man, that tow'rds you seems to bend his course, So swiftly now he crosses o're the Plain, 'Tis sure the Messenger of welcome news. Aur. Oh! nothing can be welcome but my Lord. Phyl. I see him, 'tis Alcander. Aur. Ha! alone. Where's my Amintor? Tell me, Phylante, Has not Arcadius loaded him with Chains, And sentenc'd him to Torture and to Death? Sylv. For what are you thus anxious of his Life? How wild are all these fears. You from Amintor's merit may expect Arcadius has been lavish of his Grace, And with Imperial honors crown'd your Love. Aur. 'Tis not for us to think of Honors here, For what we never see, we ne're desire. My Soul, contented with our humble state, Leaves to the Great the glories of a Court; And in possession of these Shades and Love, Unenvy'ng and unenvy'd, taste delights, Which for Elizium I wou'd scarce resign. But oh! If I, amidst of all this joy, Shou'd have Amintor ravisht from my arms, And see him perish by unnatural rage; This Vale will then be worse than Libian Wilds, All will be desert here, and all accurst, Forsook by ev'ry thing but by despair I then shall wander in a maze of woe, Till death too late o'retakes me. Sylv. What can this mean? This unexpected change, Gives me just reason to believe you've fears, Which you in vain endeavour to conceal; For I will know 'em, I that am your Friend, A name which claims the priviledge of trust, Will know your worst of Fate, as I till now Have been the partner of your hours of bliss. Enter Alcander. Alc. Madam, my Lord. Aur. Speak. Lives he? Is he free? Alc. He Lives, is free, and o're this Realm of Peace, Created by the Emp'ror, Soveraign Prince, As this informs you further. Giving a Letter. Aur. Yes 'tis his. Look in my eyes, and you'll perceive 'tis his. Why do I tremble? Is it fear or joy? Whom shou'd I fear? There's nothing sure in this: There's nothing which my Lord can send to me, But what is dear as Life, and soft as Love. Reads. Impatient of thy absence, I commit In thee, the Treasure of my heart to Heav'n. Our Embassy with rapture was receiv'd: Our Flocks and Herds, the riches of the Plain, Preferr'd to heaps of Gold, and homage Crowns. I am declar'd a Prince, and thou shalt reign If we survive the danger of this day. The Emp'ror from our Foes or Fame has heard So much of our blest Mansion, and of thee, He begg'd to be my Guest, and with his Court, Intends to visit our retreat e're even. I fly to thy relief, I can—no more. Sylv. Why weep you, when your fortune is advanc'd Above what you expected or desir'd, The Empire of our hearts you had before, But what was Friendship then is duty now, Nor shall our Friendship make our duty less. Aur. Arcadius. Sylv. What of him? I know you think This place not worthy of the Lord of Greece, Tho tis not for magnificence or shew, Or to see splendours equal with his own, That he descends to be your guest, 'Tis to behold the sweetness of this Vale, To hear the Musick of our Forest Quires, And weary'd with perpetual Pomp, to see How Solitude and Innocence can charm, For you perhaps, this journey is design'd. Your Beauty— Aur. Hold—I must not hear thee on, Thou little know'st of whom, or what thou talk'st: Ungratefully thy Friendship I've abus'd, And kept the mystery of my fate conceal'd, Which now alas, necessity reveals. Come, gentle Sylvia, take me to thy heart, Support me with thy Counsel, lest I sink Beneath the burthen of my shame and fears: Arcadius Is my Father Sylv. When you first came a stranger to these Woods, I ever thought you of divine descent, And as I thought you then adore you now. (kneels. Aur. Oh rise my Friend, I will not see thee thus. Say—does the Sun that glids this morning Sky Shine on a Creature so forlorn as me, Who can defend me from a Fathers frown, A Father and an Emperor disobey'd? Forgive me, that I dare not tell thee more, Thou soon wilt guess, that Love was all my Crime. Sylv. And Love, which was your crime is your defence. Your story at your leisure I shall know. But 'tis no more than I have often read Of Princesses, who scorn'd the Beds of Kings, When merit had before engag'd their hearts. Your Father by his favour has approv'd The choice you made, and all things will be well. Aur. Alcander execute your Lords commands. You Sylvia see that all things be prepar'd Fit to receive the Master of the World, While I with Reason and with Love consult How best I may approach my Fathers wrath, How move his pity best, or daunt his rage. Ex. Syl. Alc. Oh my Phylante, how shall we escape This Dreadful enterview, or rather meet The Storm which threatens to o'rewhelm us both. Phy. You've little cause to fear, for you are blest In the fruition of your wishes, I Have much more reason to deplore my fate, An Exile from my Parents and my hopes, Yet in your Friendship I enjoy 'em all. Aur. Oh how cou'd we foresee that we shou'd here, In this vile corner of the World, where none Scarce hear of Greece or of my Fathers name, How cou'd we think that here we shou'd have met The ruin, which we strove so much to shun? Phy. Heaven always will protect the Innocent. Aur. Who can be Innocent that disobeys A Fathers pleasure, and a Soveraign's Will? Phy. Your Father wou'd have left you to your choice, The Empress forc'd him to oppose your Vows, And in her Brothers favour wrong your Love. Aur. Wrong'd it indeed, for from our Infant years Amintor still was promis'd to my Arms But when Pulcheria dy'd was nam'd no more Phyl. You were design'd the Prince of Thrace's Bride. Aur. And who's Amintor, but the Prince of Thrace. Adrastus who possesses now his realm, Whom thou and every one, that knows him loves, Was Privy to our flight, and the design Eudosius form'd to save me for himself. Phyl. 'Tis said that Prince was in Arabia slain. Aur. 'Twas said so then, the better to conceal The Plot Adrastus had in Greece contriv'd, When he in Royal Embassy was sent To fetch me for his Brother, as before The Emperor and Eudosius had agreed. But all those Treaties with my Mother dy'd, And the new Empress a new Match resolv'd. How on this news Eudosius was enrag'd, How from his Court disguis'd he came to ours, What means he us'd to see me, and how soon My Soul consented to be rul'd by him. I only for his Fame ador'd before; This for some hour of leisure I reserve, The rest is known to thee. Phy. I lik't implicitely the man you lov'd. Nor askt with whom we fled, but always thought His actions shew'd him of the race of Kings. Who now can say that Love forgets his Slaves? Love that has led you thro such vast designs; And when the world to find their Princess rose, That kept you from the search of Nations free, That watch'd you on the Waves, and to this shoar Of safety guided you, and blest your flight. Aur. Love on his part has every thing perform'd, But what have I, Phylante! done on mine, Rebellious and a Fugitive, can I Look on my Father and not sink with shame? Phy. For what? He bid you love, and you obey'd. 'Tis true, he bid you after this to change, But that was neither in his pow'r nor yours; You fled. From whom? Placidia, one who sought Your ruine, and can hurt you now no more. Her pride and spite are bury'd in her Grave; The Emp'ror will behold you as his Child, And free'd from prejudice you'll then appear A Heavenly Treasure, which he once had lost, And now with rapture and amazement finds. Aur. Thy words are extasy, thy very looks Declare thy Prophecy Divine; And I already feel my transports grow; Arcadius will forgive me, I no more Shall clasp Eudosius with reluctant arms. For when my heart with tenderness dissolv'd, Has giv'n itself to pleasure, say ye Groves, Ye Fountain, Hill and Dale, that know my Griefs, Has not my disobedience checkt my joy, Enter Sylvia. And drawn, when we've for solitude retir'd, A thousand racking questions from my Lord, Which he no more shall ask, nor I provoke? Sylv. Reason prevails and you're your self again, And this prophetick Peace declares you safe? Yon in the Grove of pleasure, there are met Sileno, Daphne, and the Nymphs whose sports Are us'd to entertain your hour of mirth, Who waiting your approach, prepare their Songs. Aur. This sure's no hour of Mirth, no time for sports Yet Sylvia, I'll indeavour to be calm, I'll set the fairest prospect to my View, And sooth my hopes with Visions of success. Come, my Phylante, since from every Grove The cheerful Birds salute us with their Songs, Joyn thou thy better harmony with theirs, And lay the rising Tempest in my Soul; Thy Voice is still the refuge of my care, Despair herself would listen to the Charm, And when thou entertainst her lose her sting: Thrace, by the Magick of thy notes has heard More wonders, than her ancient fables boast. SONG. I. In Vain you tell me Love is sweet, And boast of his delights, I hear you talk of nothing yet, But restless days and nights, For when you have your wish enjoy'd, You find the bliss so small, You either think your Lover cloy'd, Or that you han't him all. II. Strange Magick when we see before So many Fools undone We long to make the number more, And on their Perils run. Tho thousands shou'd our hopes reprove, Who have their falshood known, In this we'll trust, so weak is Love, No knowledge but our own. Aur. The Thracian Prince may make the Fable true, And what you mean of others you may feel. Phy. Young Daphne and Sileno, and the Youth Who to divert you, form a rural Quire With their diviner Lays, shall cure you griefs, And health to your distemper'd mind restore. You then whose Angel voices and whose looks To ravish every sense, In heavenly consort join Attend! And what I taught you for your Lords return, To pleasure his belov'd and yours perform. The Front Scene opens and discovers a Circle of Seven Pillars adorn'd with Garlands of Flowers. The Shepherds and Shepherdesses dancing within it, to the Tune of the Chorus, which they sing as they Dance. Chorus. Come all away, Come and Sing and Dance and Play 'Tis the Shepherds holiday. 1 Shepherd. Leave the Mountain, Vale, and Home, To the Grove of Pleasure come: Never fear your Flocks will stray, Pan protects 'em while we play. Shepherdess. Happy Mansions, pleasant Shades, Seats of Innocence and Ease; Gentle Shepherds, Tender Maids, Sweet Abodes of Smiling Peace, Ev'ry Grace and Joy possessing, Welcome him that gives the Blessing. Shepherds Amintor's Watchful Care maintains These Quiet Fields from harms, His wisdom awes the rougher Swains, The Mild his Goodness charms. When Pan the Grecian Shepherds sway'd He ne're was more ador'd, They out of Fear their God obey'd, We out of Love, our Lord. Shepherdess. When Venus, deckt with Heavenly Charms, Once woo'd a Mortal to her Arms, All but the cruel stupid Boy Beheld her with transporting Joy; The Flocks and Herds refus'd to graze, And Men and Beasts cou'd only gaze. Aurelia's Beauties thus appear, Thus shining, thus transporting here. Shepherd. For him we Flowry Chaplets bring, The fairest praduct of the Spring. Shepherdess. For her we Crowns of Roses weave, Which both with cheerful Looks receive, And with as cheerful Hearts we give, Thus Loving and Belov'd we live. Chorus. Thus Loving and Belov'd we Live. Aur. Oh force of Musick and Cælestial Song, Which from profoundest misery can raise A Soul to extasy, and tast of Heav'n To you Phylante! I commit the charge Of this great Festival, and from your care Expect what nature, and what art can do. A March afar off. The foremost of the Græcian Court arrive, I see the Glorious Troop descend the Mount, And love informs me, that my Lord is there, To him I'll fly, and know what fate decrees; From him the sharpest Message will be sweet, Whose Voice is kinder to my Ear than sighs Of wandring Rivers, or of evening Winds. Ex. Aur. Syl. Phyl. Unhappy Princess! by ill fate persu'd To these almost the limits of the World, Oh fatal passion! Thus while I lament Thy lost condition, I forget my own, And Friendship always is too strong for Love, For now that every hour I hope to see What next to thee is dearest to my heart, Thy danger sets before my eyes a gloom, Which hides the gawdy Vision from my view, And makes it doubtful to me, if I ought To mourn for thee, or to rejoice for him. Sileno meet me at the Bow'rs of bliss, There all shall have the Parts to each assign'd, What best my thoughts can thus employ'd invent; For something noble we must now prepare, Something te ravish an Imperial Ear, Tho from you only I expect success, Whose Beauties equal with your Voices please. Ex. omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SONG. I. In Vain you tell me Love is sweet, And boast of his delights, I hear you talk of nothing yet, But restless days and nights, For when you have your wish enjoy'd, You find the bliss so small, You either think your Lover cloy'd, Or that you han't him all. II. Strange Magick when we see before So many Fools undone We long to make the number more, And on their Perils run. Tho thousands shou'd our hopes reprove, Who have their falshood known, In this we'll trust, so weak is Love, No knowledge but our own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene a Fountain with Bowers of Myrtle around it, a Shepherdess lying in one that fronts the Stage sings. SONG. To Hill and Dale I tell my Care, To Rocks and Streams how I despair; To faithless Winds my fortune mourn, The Winds in sighs my plaint return; The Streams in murmurs, Hill and Dale, And hollow Rocks my fate bewail In Ecchoes kindly they resound My moan, and seem to feel my wound: He only that should hear is deaf, He only that can give relief, Despises me, and mocks my grief. Phylante, Sileno, Shepherds and Shepherdesses come to her as the Song begins. Phyl. What hapless Virgin haunts these lonely Bow'rs, Who with these mournful sighs disturbs our Plays? Myrtilla? then 'tis but affected grief, Such beauty ne'r had reason to despair. Come, you to other notes must tune your voice, To sing of Gods, and win immortal praise. Sileno, since you challenge us to try Whose Layes have greater influence on the Soul, Whether the Trumpets lofty sounds prevail, Less than the dying whispers of your Flutes. Exert your utmost skill, for we accept Your offer, and your Valley shall resound With Musick, such as Eccho ne'r can learn. Sileno. We boast no skill, but from our artless Songs Expect success, which Nature never fails. When Birds untaught in Woods and Forests sing, Their notes seem wild, and not so just as ours, There's something in 'em yet which charms our ears More than the finest graces of your art: Why mayn't our Voices, uninflam'd like theirs, Give the same Pleasure, tho they seem as wild. Amintor (or Eudosius) and Aurelia. Phyl. Amintor and Aurelia! Let's retire, And in the thickest of this beauteous shade Attend their leisure to approve our mirth, There meditate the business of the day, And the rewards which we expect from Fame. Aur. I have thee, my Eudosius, I have all That Heav'n can give me of my hearts desire: I have thee, but how long shall I enjoy The mighty blessing? this is all my fear, And this the source of these untimely tears. My Father— Eud. 'Tis not in the power of Man Nor Gods to part what Love so firmly joyns; Nor have we liv'd for many rolling years In sweet fruition of our wish, and past Thro dangers eminent on both the Mains, To fall at last by him that gave thee life. Aur. He'll look on me perhrps as on a Child, The pangs of Nature may oppose his rage, I in the combat of his soul be safe, But how will you escape his dire revenge. He'll view thee as the robber of his house, That stole his dearest treasure thence, and lives Unlicens'd in possession of those joys, Which he and only he had right to give. Eud. That right by solemn Oaths he gave to me, Himself first tempted me to soar so high, To gaze upon thy Beauties with desire, And when he wou'd have flung me from the Heav'n To which his promise had advanc'd my hopes, Oh was it possible for me to leave Such Sweetness, such Divinity as thine: And yield thee to the bosom of thy Foe? What Danger cou'd have driven me to this, For whom had I to please but thee? Oh! were his power omnipotent as Jove's, His will as sacred, and his wrath as fierce, And I beheld thee thus profusely kind, What fear cou'd interdict me thy embrace? What duty check my transport, or defend My arms, this circle of incessant joy? Aur. To have thee thus, Eudosius, tho I saw My Father darting from his awful brow His keenest arrows, yet my soul secure In extasy, wou'd brave 'em all for thee. Eud. Away with sorrow, Fate already shews A boundless store of happiness reserv'd To recompence the troubles we have past. Aur. What made Arcadius visit our retreat? What made this show'r of favour fall on thee? Eud. When, chosen by these Provinces, I went To pay the homage which our Lord requires, Our Presents, Flocks and Herds, and crowns of Flow'rs, Were to the wealth of Italy preferr'd. He askt me, whence this plenty, and these Youth? Who rul'd for him, the Region whence they came? And ravisht with their Elegance and Looks, Declar'd this morn Amintor for their Lord, As they with tears of earnestness implor'd. Of you, Sir, smiling from the Throne on me, He said, we've heard such wonders, we resolve To see the Paradice which you possess, And be our self a witness of your sports. Aur. Adrastus—what of him? Eud. My care of thee Prevented me from being further known: For tho I dy'd to take him to my heart, I durst not let our Friendship then appear, Lest e're we were prepar'd to meet his frown, Arcadius had been jealous of our loves, And we unheard had faln before his wrath, Which now we may defeat, or else avoid. Trumpets are heard. Aur. Hark, others of the Royal Train arrive, The Trumpet ecchoes in this Vale of Peace, A noise more dreadful than the din of War. Enter Edrastus. Eud. Sink on my breast, and lose thy terrors there. Oh, my Aurelia! if thou yet hast life, Look on a sight which will enchant thy Soul. My Brother! why dost thou behold me thus? Why cruelly detain thee from my arms? What message hast thou brought, are we proscrib'd? Is Death presented us by thee, my friend? I cannot argue with thee, nor endure This distance. Oh Adrastus! Adra. Amazement! My Eudosius strikes me dumb; My Prince, my Brother, and my dearest Friend, To see thee, and embrace thee thus alive, Is more than weak humanity can bear. Forgive me, Madam, Nature flows so high That I had almost lost my duty here. Kneels. Aur. Oh rise, Adrastus, we're not now in Greece; This posture suits not with our humble state. Adra. A thousand questions I have next to ask Of my own Love, a thousand then of yours. Aur. Phylante's busy'd with her Rural friends, And in our Groves instructing 'em to sing, But she shall leave her talk to welcome you. Ex. Aurel. Eud. That sigh which from thy bosome broke its way, Discovers thou hast Secrets in thy heart Which shake thy inmost Soul. Oh speak, my Friend! Thou thinkst perhaps, that in these lowly weeds, This pomp of ease, I dare not look on Fate, Nor hear the name of danger, or of death. Adr. Oh my Eudosius, 'tis not this which swells That storm which rages in my breast: I know You ever were insensible of fear: Nor is there cause of dread in our approach. The Emp'ror oft has mourn'd your loss, and curst His fond compliance with Placidia's will. Eud. VVhy those unmanly drops than in thy eyes? Can I have joys in which thou wilt not share? Can I have pleasures which are none to thee? Adr. Yes! you have pleasures that my Nature loaths; To meet you thus a stranger to the world, Deckt like a Virgin for the Bridal morn, To find you thus in wanton Exile live, Involv'd in fatal Luxury and Peace. Your childish train like Cupids in our plays, Your house the Image of the Paphian Court, Breathing rich odours to debauch your sence, And use you to forget your thirst of Fame. Is this d' think delightful to a Friend, Who once beheld you in the dusty Field, Pierce thro the thickest of the Foes of Greece? Eud. Did'st thou not see the vision, that e'en now With dazzling lustre fill'd this place, which Earth Can't equal, nor the spangled worlds above? Did'st thou not see her, shed her beams on me, Her sweetest Influence, and wou'dst thou leave Such happiness, for Empire or for Fame? Ard. When Love opposes Glory, tho 'tis worse Than death to quit such fulness of delight: Yet Fame, Ambition, and your peoples wants, Shou'd rouse you from this Lethargy of ease, And snatch you from the Syrens fatal charm. Eud. To thee this life, which now thou woud'st condemn, To thee I owe this exile and this ease. Thy Counsels first inspir'd me to resign My States to thee, and in some distant Realm, Secure my Princess from a Foes embrace. By thee my people of my death were told, The faith they ow'd to me they've sworn to thee, Nor let thy jealousy disturb thy reign, 'Tis that or Envy urges this reproach. Adr. By Heaven you wrong me, I despise your Throne. The Honour of our House, which I prefer To Life, or Soveraign Dignity's concern'd; And not to speak was to betray my friend. But 'tis too late, I see you stand unmov'd, You're deaf to every sound but sighs of Love: Forgive me, 'tis too bold a truth, I've done. Eud. Oh my Adrastus, why dost thou attempt To vex my tortur'd mind beyond its force? Dost thou not think the trouble of this day, Aurelia's danger, and thy Brother's care, Sufficient to suppress me? Thou shalt see, Insulted by the Waves of adverse Fate, The Billows all shall break away in foam, And beat on me as on a shoar of Flint; But when a future Calm serenes our Sky, When we have sported on a Sea of Joy, And Peace is to this Land of Love restor'd, I'll raise a Nation here, whose name shall live, When Greece shall be no more. Enter Aur. and Phyl. Adr. There spoke the Genius of our Godlike Line. But oh! how vain my Reasons had appear'd, Had these been here, before whose conqu'ring Eyes The wisest and the bravest fall. And Love is Truth and Fame. Kneels to Phyl. Phyl. Welcome, my Lord, to this blest Realm and me. To see you here, and not to wish you well, Had I ne're known your merit, had been base, But to the Brother of a friend I owe— Adr. Oh say not to the Brother of a Friend; You owe to me, your Lover and your Slave, All that to years of Constancy is due. Oh my Phylante! Phyl. Nay, my Lord, forbear; What for the tryal of my Friendship's done Is what again I'd for Aurelia do; Our Souls were one before I heard your name, And when I saw to what she was expos'd, Had I abandon'd her to Wilds and Seas, To wander o're the pathless world alone, Say—wou'd you then have thought me worth your heart? Aur. Too long you waste your Minutes in dispute. Enter Sileno, Shepherds and Shepherdesses. Behold, my Lord, the Natives of this place, With what surprize they view your Princely mien. The pride of Courts by them unseen till now. Oh happy Ignorance; that never felt The sting of wild Ambition, which will oft, Ev'n in these humble Mansions vex my Soul. Enter Sylv. and Messenger. Mess. The Emp'ror with his Train are on their way, And at the Palace now will soon arrive. Sylv. We are all ready to receive the Court, With splendour equal to their mighty name. Phyl. Advance Sileno, let the sports begin, We'll have no time to think of future ills. The Fury Terror, by our Lays disarm'd, Shall cease to sting, and fly the Magick sound. For shou'd your Musick be preferr'd to ours, The sighs of Lover to the voice of War: Or be the Conquest, Shepherds, yours or mine, VVe're sure to triumph o're our Judges both. After a Symphony of Hautboys and Flutes, Sileno sings. Ye Birds, who in our Forests sing, Ye Winds, that wanton with our Trees, Ye Streams, that murmur to forsake your Spring, Be silent, ye outrageous Seas, Attend the Rural Song: 'Tis Love's the theme, Love all our Lays employs, Parent of Heavenly Verse, and heav'nly Joys; With numbers soft as their Desires, With Words and Notes which speak their Fires, He warms the Tuneful Throng. Then the Trumpets play, and the Kettle-Drums. That over, A Lady sings. Cease your Amorous Pipes and Flutes, The Trumpet for the Prize disputes; The Swains must listen to a loftier sound, You only flatter their despair, The Trumpet drives away their Care, And makes 'em languish for a nobler wound. Sileno. Hark! what frightful notes I hear, Which Eccho is tormented to reply; The trembling Sheep and Shepherds fly; The Plain and Mountain struck with deadly fear; This Clangor sure was made for Death; Our Pipes and Flutes have no such fatal breath. They ease our Pains, they sooth our Care; These sounds wou'd drive us to Despair; Forbear the dreadful notes, forbear. Flutes and Hautboys again. Shepherd. See, the trembling Sheep revive, The Shepherds seem again to live. Shepherdss. These gentle murmurs suit our Shades, And best our Passions move; With pity they inspire our Maids, And teach our Youth to Love. Chorus. These gentle, &amp;c. Hautboys and Flutes again. Aur. You both have happily perform'd your part, By one transported, by another charm'd, You both excell'd by turns. a March is heard. Eud. Again the noble Clangor rends our Caves, And tells us our Imperial Guest is nigh, This the important hour on which depends Our lasting Peace, and this begins with smiles. Oh may't not prove, as we have sometimes seen, A stormy noon succeed a chearful morn? But why shou'd we the worst of fortune fear, Love was our crime, and Love is master here. Ex. Omnes. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene a Hall of the Palace, Representing the Court of Pan. After the Song of Fame is over, Pan rises (while the Musick plays) in a Wood, being several rows of Trees illuminated. All the Actors on the Stage, A Warlike Tune. Fame. Thro wondring Worlds I Cæsar's worth proclaim, The Nations tremble at his mighty name: My hundred Tongues his matchless deeds declare, In Peace his Wisdom, or his Force in War. Himself at rest, my Labours never cease To spread his Vertues, or in War or Peace. Pan. What voice is this, to me unknown, What noise, which in the Elysian Shades Disturbs my quiet Reign? If God or Goddess, hence be gone, Nor vex our Youth, nor fright our Maids, But leave to me the Plain; I know thee by thy hundred Tongues, Thy hundred Ears, and thousand Eyes, To Court go sing thy flatt'ring Songs, Among the Great disperse thy Lyes, Nor raise Confusion in our peaceful Land. And you, who reign with Pan below, Ascend; and ye who rove in Wilds, Or press the Vine, or watch in Fields, Who use the Crook, or bend the Bow, Appear at my Command. Satyr, Shepherds, Shepherdesses, Bacchanalian, Hunters, Huntresses. Hunters and Huntresses. We come from the Mountain, and hunting the Fox. Shepherds and Shepherdesses. And we from the Valley, and keeping our Flocks. Satyr. I come from the Forest, and plucking up Trees. Bacchanalian. And I from the Wine-press, and sucking fat Lees. Chorus. At Pan's great Command we leave Working and Play, To wait on his call, which with Joy we obey. Ceres ascends. Ceres. Where's my Pan, my Lord, my Love, Why flies he from the Sacred Grove, Why flies he from his Ceres arms, For mortal Beauty, leave immortal Charms? Pan. One of the Gods, who rule on Earth, Descends to visit now the Plain; For him we bring forth all our mirth; For him too summon you your Train. Our Presence shall their Rural Triumphs grace, And with celestial lustre fill the place. Ceres. Ye Men and Maids, who cut the Ear, Or bind the bounteous Sheave, Who reap the Golden Meads appear, A while your Labour leave. Binders and Reapers. Reap. Our work at an end, we'll awhile go to play, To Binding and Reaping a much better way. This Harvest thus in, for the next we will Plow, And if we expect a new Crop we must Sow. Bind. Not so hasty, you're too warm; Thus all Renters for a year, When they mean to leave a Farm, Care not what they wear or tear. Come—Man, since you are so stout, Take a Lease on't, and be merry, There's no fear you'll wear it out, When you are oblig'd to tarry. Reap. Oh talk not of Leases, I hate 'em, my Honey, Your Copy Lands are for men who have Money. When I rent at my will, I can do as I please; And had much rather Hold by another mans Lease. Bind. You and I shall never deal, Put an end then to the strife, Give me both your Hand and Seal, And the Soil is yours for Life. Reap. By my troth 'tis too hard, as the Taxes go now, When my Landlord paid all, we more freely could sow; But since I have try'd it, and know how 'twill bear, 'Tis a bargain between us. Bind. For Life. Reap. For a Year. For two Voices. Pan &amp; Ceres. Plenty, mirth and gay delights, Pleasant days, and blissful nights; All the sweets of Love and Peace, Numerous Flocks and large Increase, Ever bless you, Joy attend ye, Pan and Ceres still befriend ye, While they descend Fame appears. The Trumpet sounds. Fame. Away with all these fatal Charms, Away with these deluding Sounds, The notes that rouze the fearful Camp to Arms, That from the Coward drive his false alarms, And make him dauntless look on death and wounds. Fame to these Woods again restores, And with the Emp'rors potent name torments the lab'ring Shores. While the Musick is performing, Arcadius seems to talk very earnestly with Parmenio and Nicias. Eud. Observe, Adrastus, how Arcadius stands Unmov'd by Harmony, or Artful shew: Ev'n I who trembling on the brink of fate, Behold the horrid Precipice, am charm'd. What cares are his superiour then to mine? Par. The Emp'ror, weary'd with the days fatigue, Wills, that all leave him but the Prince of Thrace. Ex. Om. but Arc. Ad. Par. and Nic. Arc. That I have cause to think I am betray'd, This wealth, with which our own can scarce compare These Tow'rs, these rich Alcoves, these Gilded Roofs, And all this bright magnificence declare. Is this the dwelling of a private Swain? This the retreat of discontent and love? The Mines of Asia, and the Ethiop Sands, Scarce in the course of ten abundant years, Produce more Treasures than my Eyes behold. I see you know the Master of this place, Already grown his confident and friend. You have your secrets and your private talk, While I with Fairy Dance and Song amus'd, Play with my danger, as the Pilot steers Tow'rds the sweet Voice which tempts him to the Rock. Adr. Yourself, my Lord, discover'd first his worth, You, who so soon advanc'd him to a Throne, Might well expect th'admiring world would gaze With more than common pleasure on the man, Whom, from profoundest solitude, you chose To wear a Scepter, and to sit with Kings. Arc. This solitude so gloriously adorn'd, These Riches hidden in a Diamond Cave, Might tempt a Hermits Faith, and make him view The Empire of the world with lustful Eyes, Nor dropt they like yon gay Machines from Heav'n, Nor is it painted Wealth, but Massy Gold. Have you not heard him boast his high descent. What Princess, careless of her Nuptial Vow, Has bred this Issue of polluted Love, To nourish Treason here, and prove at last Her injur'd Monarch's ruin, and his shame? Adr. This of a Prince? and underneath his Roof? Arc. You're toucht, Sir, and would tell me this is base Ingrate, Inhospitable, and unjust, Your Eyes convict you, and your glowing Cheeks Burn with projected Mischiefs. But Princes must not trifle with their Fate, From whence this Rural prodigy? What Realm Cou'd spare the Treasure that supports this Cost? Adr. He told you whence himself, From this blest Land where Peace and Safety dwell, Where no projected mischiefs e're were form'd. No Princess, careless of her Nuptial Vow, E're thought to wrong her Monarch, or prophane This Vale of innocence with lawless love. Arc. The secret which you dare not trust with me, Is brooding mischiefs of the blackest form. Prince! you're my Pris'ner till the truth is known. Adr. Is this the safety of an Emp'rors Faith? But that the Crown which glitters on your brow Commands submission, and forbids my arm The vengeance to a Soveraigns honour due, These chains shou'd never else affront your name, Myself wou'd else be Guardian of your Oath, And force you to be just. Arc. Guards! till you hear from us observe the Prince; To all but those whom we allow, defend Admittance near him, 'tis our lifes concern. Ex. Nic. with Adr. Next him, by whom I reign, I know no pow'r Superiour to my own. No Judge, who durst Declare against my pleasure that is wrong, Which the Imperial word pronounces right. I for this deed can answer to my self, The world must then be satisfy'd. Par. 'Tis evident, the Treason's grown mature. What Interest has Adrastus in this man? This rising Comet, whose portentous look To Nations threatens ruin. Is this the Mansion of a Village, Lord? The Roman Chiefs, in their triumphal pride, Were never more illustrious in their sports, Than those ev'n now with wonder I behold. The Prince, by nature turbulent and proud, Brooks not the narrow limits of his Thrace; With envy he beheld Byzantium's wealth, When for his Brother, with opprobrious terms, He wou'd have forc'd your Daughter from your arms. Arc. Oh! thou hast rous'd a fury in my breast, Which stings me worse than Scorpions fiery tongues, Why didst thou name my Daughter? she was once. The blessing of my Youth, The glory of my Court, The fairest product of Pulcheria's Love: But now a wanderer in some barren Clime, Driv'n by my cruelty to spend her Spring, With a vile ravisher in want and pain. Par. 'Tis time, my Lord, to think of this no more, What we can't help we must with patience bear, And when you're thus by threatning dangers prest, Look forwards to prevent the future ills. Arc. What wou'd'st thou that we do? I yet can see: No ills, but such as from suspicion rise. Perhaps as Idle as Adrastus threats. Par. In Rome, 'twas whisper'd that Byzantium's Streets With Thracian Captains swarm'd, and Thracian arms, Your self has heard the Rumours which have spread. Of Armies on the Borders to revenge An injur'd Brother, true—the rumours dy'd, But still the Injury, as they tell you, lives. Arc. Again, thy just reproaches rack my Soul; To what wou'd'st thou perswade me? Par. To be safe. The business of my days, my nightly care Is to preserve you from the strokes, Of such as dare not meet you in the Field. Arc. What plots hast thou discover'd? Par. None, my Lord? Howe'er, I thought it strange to see the Prince Abandon Thrace, and hear Amintor's name So often chanted in your ears with praise: Nor were his Friends contented till their pray'rs Extorted from your bounty what 'tis plain, They meant to take without your gift, a Crown. Why, when this Journey was at first propos'd, Were there such reasons giv'n you to adjourn The visit, or disswade you from't? And when He saw you wou'd not listen to him. Why Must he be foremost, was he not afraid, His friends might be surpriz'd, or unprepar'd. It may be only Fancy, but if e're My Loyalty foresaw a black design, And was of service to your Empire, now This very hour, the wit of Hell's at work, And you're the destin'd Victim. Arc. Heav'n! he shakes With honest fears, do with me what thou wilt, We'll to the City, arm the Roman bands, And storm the Palace in the face of noon. Adr. No, 'tis not worth your care, command your Guard: To seize on every Post which may oppose Assistance from the Province. This at first They must with utmost secrecy perform; While I by promis'd Tortures and Rewards, Discover from Amintor's Slaves, how long Their Lord has known the Prince of Thrace, and whence Their Master, and this Mass of Riches came. Arc. Be careful of my name, nor let the world Re-enter Nic. Report my Host insulted by his Guest, On groundless Tales, and visionary Fears. I'll give directions to my Guards: The rest Is left to thee. Be wise. Ex. Alc. Par. Be so your self, fond Emp'ror! Was not your Reason clouded by your fears, The Tyrant passion of your Soul, you soon Wou'd see thro all my airy Plots; and Truth And Innocence wou'd shine like perfect day. Well, Nicias! thou, I know art pleas'd to see The hour, for which we oft have wisht to find. The Lord of Greece from Foreign Counsels free, Consents to hear his Friends, and own their Love: How suits Confinement with Adrastus, say? Does he not rage, and like a Forrest Boar Entangled in the Snare, by raging close The toil the faster on him. Nic. Yes! A while; his wild resentment threaten'd VVar, And with injurious words, denounc'd to Greece Eternal Enmity: But most to you. The Emp'ror and the Empire's ruin. This He oft repeated in outrageous Phrase, And darted from his Eyes avengeful fires. Par. I laugh to hear him talk of War in Chains. His Fury's impotent, his Sword is mine, He lives, but till my Love has full revenge, And reacht Phylante's Image in his heart. Oh! thou remembrest when the cruel Maid, Deaf to my sighs, and heedless of my tears, Profusely on him lavisht guilty smiles, And spurn'd me from her feet with utmost scorn. The curst remembrance of that shameful hour, Is fatal to my Foe—He dies. Nor can Arcadius save him, 'tis too late; Tho as he's won't, he shou'd this minute change, His breach of Treaty's ne're to be compos'd, But to be safe, the Prince of Thrace must dye, Nic. Or Greece must perish by intestine broils, Brothers by Brothers fall, and Friends by Freinds, Which to prevent— Par. Ay Nicias, that's my task. To hinder this the Thracian Prince must bleed, The Emp'ror seize his State. Nic. For what? Par. That's left To me, and if my Vengeance proves so weak, It can't find reasons for his death, 'tis just My wrongs unpunisht should be still my shame. I know thee, faithful Nicias, that with thee My most important secrets are secure. Amintor, or whatever else he's stil'd, When his Friends safety calls, perhaps may arm The Province h'as obtain'd, but what he meant Of service to the Prince shall prove his doom. The Roman Guards at several Posts are plac'd, To quell the Village Tumults in their rise. Thy charge, of highest moment, is within: Let none without the Imperial Signet see Adrastus, 'twill enrage him yet the more, And that the more encrease the Emp'rors fears, On which my hopes depend. Enter Eud. and Alca. Nic. My Lord, our Host. Par. Retire, expect anon Instructions further from me. My business now is not with him, but yet Tis criminal to love the man I hate. Ex. Par. &amp; Nic. Eud. Confin'd, without my knowledge, in my house, Against the faith of Nations and of Leagues; From thee who never didst deceive me. This Wou'd scarce be credible, but that the looks Of him, who there avoided us, declare The guilt of wicked Counsels, and confirm Enter Aurelia. Thy just report, and make our danger sure. Oh my Aurelia! Aur. Tell me why that sigh? Is it for me thy nature's on the rack? For me, that these Convulsions shake thy Soul. Oh let me share the anguish of thy mind Say—We must dye—Alas! I know we must, And in my Crime rejoyce, my Love of thee. Fate in thy Brother has begun her spoils, Our Lot I know is next. Eud. Oh cease thy tears. And if 'tis in thy heart to love me less, In pity to us both attempt it now: For while I see thee thus endearing kind, I grow a Coward, and cou'd wish to live. Think of the Glories thou hast left, the worlds That would have kneel'd before thee but for me. Think of the heats that oft have parcht thy limbs, The tedious nights which we have liv'd in Snow, The Tempests which have tost thee on the Main, The hateful Exile thou hast since endur'd, The terrours that assault thee. Think on this, And then behold me as the cause of all. Aur. Oh! I for ever cou'd behold thee thus. For ever feast my longing eyes on thine. Thee, the last object that shall bless their Rayes, And give my parting Soul a taste of heav'n; For heav'n, they tell us, is but perfect Love, And mine's perfection when I look on thee. Eud. Why, when my care presag'd this dreadful hour Why did my Brother bring us hopes of peace, Or that thy Father would forgive our flight, When thou the darling of his age were't found? Oh thou art found to him, but lost to me. The fatal secret's known, my Friend in Chains, This, this, Aurelia, racks me worse than Wheels: I've liv'd a Slave too long, a worthless Slave, I've seen my Brother injur'd to my face, And Patient of his bonds expect my own. Wou'd I in Thrace have suffer'd this from Kings? My house by Foreign pow'rs prophan'd. Has he then mockt me with a Soveraigns name, The word that said it was the voice of Heav'n Pronounc'd by him, and here 'tis mine to Reign? Oh, had th'Arabian Host beheld me thus, Thus passive in my wrongs, they ne're had fled From Thracian Arms, nor shunn'd the Victors Sword. Aur. Cease the remembrance of that glorious day, Talk not of War, your business is with Love. Eud. My business is with Death? Aur. Oh! speak, my Lord, You think too much on things which long are past, I'll to my Father, tell him of our Loves. Eud. And beg him, wou'dst thou not to let us live, By Heav'n, I scorn to owe my Life to one, Who can't defend his own, I'll give my Brother liberty or dye, Nor wou'd I yield to live till he is free? Alcander to Dametas—Let him know Our danger, 'tis enough, and tell his Friends That if we want their aid, they be prepar'd Ex. Alc. Come, my Aurelia! See, my Fury's o're, And I am gentle now as Lovers dreams. Aur. With you indeed 'tis but a dream to love, Which waking, you forget, or blush to own. Off—Off—I dare not gaze, for never man Could look so much like truth, and be so false. Eud. Oh why this language, to my ear unknown; By thee too left, I'm wretched then indeed. Come—While this minute is our own, and whose The next shall be, or where we next shall meet, Is only known to Fate. While this is ours, Come—Let us spend it like the rest in love. Aur. That word from thee's like sounds of empty air. Love always best is in obedience seen. Had I been dear to thee, thou ne're hadst thought Of War, nor mention'd it against my Will, And who's this Foe with whom thou wou'd'st contend The Father of thy Wife, Thy Emp'ror and thy Guest. From thee by Guards and Troops of Slaves secur'd, And what wou'd'st thou oppose to this, a band Of Village Heroes arm'd with Crooks and Staves. Wer't thou in Thrace, thy Armies on their march Led on by thee and Greece, the destin'd Prize. Dost think thy Feudatory Realm, a Match For the great Empire of the world. Had I been dear to thee, as thou hast sworn, Thou wou'd'st not to offend me act like one Whom Reason has forsook. Eud. Was I in Thrace, my Armies on their march, And the great Empire of the world the Prize, Thus govern'd, I should think of Philip's Son, Who with a chosen few subdu'd the East, And made the proud Euphrates flow with Blood. But in this peaceful Region, where I see A Prize much fairer than the subject World, What wou'd I not? Aur. Thy Eyes speak what thou wou'd'st, and they are truth, They force belief beyond a thousand Oaths. We wander in the dark, misled by fear; For was the secret known, thy self wou'd first My Fathers Vengeance feel, if Vengeance still Is in his breast reserv'd; of him inform'd. For what Adrastus suffers, you may then; Or arm, or sue for Peace, as we resolve. Eud. We all dispute in vain with what we love. I'll to Arcadius, shew him how this deed VVill ever be injurious to his Fame. Thou to Phylante, and forget thy griefs, To lessen hers, who now abounds in woe. These dangers cannot long our Loves molest, For death or pardon soon must bring us rest. Ex. Omnes. End of the Third Act.</field>

Thro wondring Worlds I Cæsar's worth proclaim, The Nations tremble at his mighty name: My hundred Tongues his matchless deeds declare, In Peace his Wisdom, or his Force in War. Himself at rest, my Labours never cease To spread his Vertues, or in War or Peace. Pan. What voice is this, to me unknown, What noise, which in the Elysian Shades Disturbs my quiet Reign? If God or Goddess, hence be gone, Nor vex our Youth, nor fright our Maids, But leave to me the Plain; I know thee by thy hundred Tongues, Thy hundred Ears, and thousand Eyes, To Court go sing thy flatt'ring Songs, Among the Great disperse thy Lyes, Nor raise Confusion in our peaceful Land. And you, who reign with Pan below, Ascend; and ye who rove in Wilds, Or press the Vine, or watch in Fields, Who use the Crook, or bend the Bow, Appear at my Command. Satyr, Shepherds, Shepherdesses, Bacchanalian, Hunters, Huntresses. Hunters and Huntresses. We come from the Mountain, and hunting the Fox. Shepherds and Shepherdesses. And we from the Valley, and keeping our Flocks. Satyr. I come from the Forest, and plucking up Trees. Bacchanalian. And I from the Wine-press, and sucking fat Lees. Chorus. At Pan's great Command we leave Working and Play, To wait on his call, which with Joy we obey. Ceres ascends. Ceres. Where's my Pan, my Lord, my Love, Why flies he from the Sacred Grove, Why flies he from his Ceres arms, For mortal Beauty, leave immortal Charms? Pan. One of the Gods, who rule on Earth, Descends to visit now the Plain; For him we bring forth all our mirth; For him too summon you your Train. Our Presence shall their Rural Triumphs grace, And with celestial lustre fill the place. Ceres. Ye Men and Maids, who cut the Ear, Or bind the bounteous Sheave, Who reap the Golden Meads appear, A while your Labour leave. Binders and Reapers. Reap. Our work at an end, we'll awhile go to play, To Binding and Reaping a much better way. This Harvest thus in, for the next we will Plow, And if we expect a new Crop we must Sow. Bind. Not so hasty, you're too warm; Thus all Renters for a year, When they mean to leave a Farm, Care not what they wear or tear. Come—Man, since you are so stout, Take a Lease on't, and be merry, There's no fear you'll wear it out, When you are oblig'd to tarry. Reap. Oh talk not of Leases, I hate 'em, my Honey, Your Copy Lands are for men who have Money. When I rent at my will, I can do as I please; And had much rather Hold by another mans Lease. Bind. You and I shall never deal, Put an end then to the strife, Give me both your Hand and Seal, And the Soil is yours for Life. Reap. By my troth 'tis too hard, as the Taxes go now, When my Landlord paid all, we more freely could sow; But since I have try'd it, and know how 'twill bear, 'Tis a bargain between us. Bind. For Life. Reap. For a Year. For two Voices. Pan &amp; Ceres. Plenty, mirth and gay delights, Pleasant days, and blissful nights; All the sweets of Love and Peace, Numerous Flocks and large Increase, Ever bless you, Joy attend ye, Pan and Ceres still befriend ye, While they descend Fame appears. The Trumpet sounds. Fame. Away with all these fatal Charms, Away with these deluding Sounds, The notes that rouze the fearful Camp to Arms, That from the Coward drive his false alarms, And make him dauntless look on death and wounds. Fame to these Woods again restores, And with the Emp'rors potent name torments the lab'ring Shores.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene an Apartment before that where Adrastus is confin'd. Aurelia, Phylante, Sileno, Myrtilla, &amp;c. Aur. Where will your sorrow lead you? Can your tears O're doors of Brass prevail, or Marble Walls, Or Savage man, less flexible than these? Phy. 'Tis yet imperfect night, and all is husht, As if her time was spent, and day was nigh. What means this early quiet, when our shades, Converted to a Court, shou'd ring with noise, VVhich waits on Princes, and proclaims their state? The hours that labour with our Fate are vext To bring the dreadful issue forth, and lag Behind their course. Forgive me, I am rude, My senses wand'ring make me hear your words, As things which came not from a Friend like you. Aur. To speak you comfort, is I know in vain, All Counsel in excess of trouble's lost. But what can you propose by coming here; Tis death for these to let you see the Prince: Or was it not, while you believe him safe, A minutes absence you may well endure. Phyl. An age for you I suffer'd with content, An age of absence for my friend; but then I thought him safe, and wou'd not wish for more. My eyes have seen him since, the pleasure's new, And I again must see him, or I dye. Aur. You will, on us th'impending storm will fall, VVith us the Emp'rors wrath will end, with us His bounds and your despair will be no more. Phyl. For you my heart weeps blood as well as him. My Pity thus divided, scarce can tell Where first she should her mournful office pay. She's us'd to visit you, the stranger claims His debt, and with a voice which will be heard. Aur. You've reason, was it in your pow'r to act, The Guards remov'd, the rest you might o'recome. Soft musick begins here, and continues till the other is perform'd. Phyl. And these we'll conquer with the rest, if 'tis In Numbers, or in Notes to win on man. We'll move their hearts to listen to our pray'r, And when they're most defenceless tempt their faith. Aur. On Souls dispos'd to yield you may succeed, But few will venture where the crime is death. This sooner will betray 'em from their trust, My Fathers Signet which I brought from Greece, That serv'd us in our flight, if pray'rs should fail, Produce it as the Emp'rors dread command. Be speedy in your Enterprize, and learn From whence this violence arose, and how We may, if possible, prevent its growth. Phy. 'Tis fatal to expose this Signet here, But still more fatal to remain in doubt. I'll try by softer means to make my way, This the last method I'll attempt to use. Aur. I see 'tis time to leave you, and to heav'n VVill lift my vows, to prosper your design Ex. Aur. Phyl. Ye fair companions of my better days! Come, minister your aid in my distress, And with your tuneful airs compose my mind. She lies on a Couch, Musick plays louder, Scene opens and discovers Nicias and Guards waiting on Adrastus. Shepherdess. Underneath a Gloomy Shade, By an antient Poplar made, While the Zephyrs round her play, Cloris thus complaining lay, Where shall I Philander find? Eccho answer'd her, Behind. Thrice she turn'd and saw 'twas false, Cursing Ecchoes lying tales, Thus she mourn'd again, and said, Where is my Philander fled? From his Flocks, his Friends and Me; When shall I my Lover see, Whither turn to find him out? Eccho answer'd her, About. Shepherd. By Eccho thus mockt, on a Bank she reclines, Resolv'd ne're to trust her complaint to the winds, Till Cupid, who pity'd her Sorrow and Tears, On the wings of a Dove to assist her appears. Cupid is seen the Air. Cupid. Love descends at your complaint, He who knows what most you want. Bids you to the Cave repair, Where you us'd to vent your care, You shall find your Lover there. Bound by mighty Pan he lies, Piercing with his grief the Skies. There with your Companions go, Try what Virgin Songs will do. The force of Youth and Beauty try, And Pan will yield as well as I. Shepherd. We'll go the Cave where the Shepherd in Chains Lies wrongfully punish'd for Crimes he abhors; With our Layes we'll endeavour to lessen his pains, And please him with singing the name he adores. 'Tis Cloris, who loves him, the Cloris he loves, Who must use all her art to obtain him relief; But she'll use it in vain, for her Harmony moves Rocks only and Trees, and the Tyrant's still deaf. Shepherdess. Happy, ever happy we, Cou'd we see Philander free. Love, the best and sweetest Care, Is our only Torment here. The Ghost of Orpheus arises. Ghost of Orpheus. In vain, fair Nymph, with your Celestial art, You strive to move a Mortal's heart. Ev'n I, whose Musick husht the roar of Heil, And made her Fiends forget their Plains, When not one hideous groan, nor yell, Was heard throughout the Stygian Plains, Whose voice to things insensible was known, And dancing Woods confest its wondrous pow'r; I ne're could humane rage repel, But by the Monsters fury fell, Which often does her first begot, and darling Sons devour. Cease your Heavenly notes a while, You will soon your Lover see, Keep your Songs till fate shall smile. Fate has told you this by me. Chorus. Haste, ye happy minutes, haste, To Cloris her Lover restore; And grant us, ye Gods, when this danger is past, That Pan may torment us no more. Nic. 'Tis all Enchantment, every thing I see, And hear, and meet transports me, or I dream, Or I have seen that Angel form before; A fairer sure I never saw, nor heard Such sounds in Greece, where first the Lyre was strung. Phy. You seem surpriz'd. Nic. And who without surprize Can hear such harmony, or look on you. I thought in woods to meet with none but Nymphs Of humble make, and here I find a choire Of Beauties, who may well adorn a Court. Phy. This language in a Soldier we excuse, Their words, like their profession, should be rough, And when you speak us fair, we women think 'Tis meant to do us wrong. Nic. To such as you, 'Tis equally impossible to speak In harsher phrase, or mean to do you wrong. Phy. If by your talk I might your temper guess, I rather should believe you'd help our Sex, That begg'd a service of you, tho it lookt Like danger, than dismiss 'em with reproach. Nic. For you, whate'er you ask, by heav'n! 'tis done, My Master's honour, and his life secur'd. Phy. My business is within. Nic. Ha! I'm betray'd. Madam, my Oath's still unprofan'd and you— Phy. Deny'd—what less could I expect from man, Than with one breath to swear, and be forsworn. Nic. My Masters honour, and his life secur'd, I swear again, whate're you ask, 'tis done. Phy. How if I saw the Prince, wou'd that concern Your Masters honour or his safety? Nic. Both. His honour in my breach of his Command, His safety in my serving of his Foe. Shews the Signet. Phy. This then is his command. Nic. Which I obey. Phy. I try'd your Loyalty, and found you true. The Royal word that order'd this, forbids Such liberty to all but me. Be just. Enter Parm. Par. Is that the apartment of the Thracian Prince? Nic. Yes. Par. Or my Eyes deceive me, or I saw A woman enter there. Nic. You did, my Lord. Par. By whose command? Nic. The Emp'rors, she produc'd His Signet. Par. 'Tis impossible! But now We parted, and since last I saw thee, none Have been allow'd to see him but my self. Confusion! he has cheated me, or thou Art by some idle tale abus'd, I'll know The meaning of this Riddle, and by whom Thy truth has been debauch'd. Would Enter, &amp; is stopt. Nic. My Lord forbear. To you this liberty I must defend. The Imperial Licence reaches only her. Par. Oh Insolence! art thou too of their plots? Let me no more be call'd the Emp'rors friend If I forget this Injury. Nic. Yourself Permitted only such to pass as brought My Masters Signet; she was first, and I Have sworn to see the Emp'rors word obey'd. If pray'rs or charms that would have melted Rocks, Cou'd have seduc'd me from my trust. To these I sooner had submitted than to threats. She tempted every sence to try my Faith, My Ears with Musick, that might match the Spheres, My Eyes with smiles that wou'd have won on Priests, And forc'd a Hermit to forget his Vow. Par. From whnce these racking thoughts? it cannot be I tremble yet, as if my fears were true; Amidst their sports a Virgin I beheld, Who seem'd the Goddess of their mirth, and such Was she, her Beauty and her Art conspir'd Alike, to triumph o're Mankind. Hadst thou ne're seen this Lady? I grow mad. 'Tis all Extravagance. Nic. My Lord, I gaz'd So much, and with such pleasure, I began To think I might have seen her oft in Greece. Par. Where? Nic. In Byzantium. VVith the Princess. Parm. Ha! If thou cou'dst, unconcern'd, imagin this, Tho reason is against me, what I feel Confirms my jealousies, and thy report. Six years the Princess has been lost, and Fame Not once has nam'd the place to which she fled. Martian, the Captain of Arcadius Guards, Convey'd her; him I still remember well. True—These are wanderers, but they rose from Flocks And Herds to govern men—Besides, I ne're Have met Amintor till I came to Rome. Why, when the Emp'ror of the East descends To grace this Mansion with his presence, why Must she be sick at this unlucky hour? Who owns it, and of whom we heard such talk. Sure, any one but he I serve, had guest E're now. What Treasure could support this cost, 'Tis plain, this Lady Nicias is the same, For whom the Prince of Thrace remains in bonds, And in eternal bonds must soon be laid. Nic. My Lord, you've rais'd suspicions in my breast, Which make me wonder we could err so long. Phyl. crosses the Stage as from Adrastus. Par. Then I will see. Distraction! I am fixt, My Limbs forsake me; what is this but Love? And who is she that awes me thus unseen? Phylante! coming from my Rivals arms: Ye Furies, can I fancy this and live? Time flies on nimble Wings, and I must haste, Thou know'st of what importance 'tis to me And thee, whose Fortune wholly lives on mine, That since we have Adrastus in our power, We ne'er may be in his—And if at last Arcadius knows the secret we suspect, Let this secure us both, and all the spoils Gives a Dagger. Of Thrace in equal portions shall be ours. The Emp'ror shall believe he gave the blow Himself, and freed from him, suppose the worst, The Princess with her pardon will be pleas'd. Nic. All but my being, to your gift I owe, Convinc'd, that if Adrastus scapes us now, Not only you, my Lord, but I must fall, Which best instructs me what to do. Ent. Emp. &amp; Train. Parm. Enough— The Emp'ror; we from him must keep our doubts, For he with rapture would receive the news, And we should act in vain. Arc. What further is discover'd, is our Host In league for our destruction with the Prince, Or holds he guilty Commerce with our Foes? Par. You best can tell what Commerce, Sir, he holds Your tydings are of later date than mine. Arc. You speak in fables, has your Wisdom found New plots, or are you weary of the old. Parm. Whom you approve, my Lord, at least in me 'Twere folly to condemn. Perhaps my zeal Already has transported me too far? Arc. Our danger is your sport; what means this change? Have you betray'd me to commit a deed, Outrageous to the sanctity of Crowns. And would you when you see your weakness, throw The shame on us. No more, I am not now Dispos'd to play with what concerns our life Or honour. Par. We have reason to believe. You think, my Lord, that you are safe in both. The Lady, who this minute left the Prince, Whose word cou'd pass where mine was heard like wind, She doubtless has convinc'd you you are safe. Arc. What Lady? Still you keep me on the Rack? Who's this that has usurpt such mighty power? Par. The pow'r was yours, your Signet licenc'd all. Arc. My Signet? see 'tis here—Nor have I seen A humane Face but these since thine. Par. Your Guards Will tell you what has past of late. I saw A Woman enter, and the Signet shewn. Nic. &amp; Guards. My Lord, 'twas yours, your Signet. Arc. Treason all. I'll have you to the Wheel, your Tongues will then Speak Truth. Par. My Lord, their truth deserves reward, And those the torture who abus'd your name. Arc. Excuse me, by thy Friendship 'tis I live They cou'd not steel it from me. Par. Not so soon This mischief must be old, and form'd in Greece. The Signet wrought by yours to be produc'd On all extremities, their Plots should want. I wou'd have enter'd, and have seen by whom This trick was manag'd, but your Guards were told, The Imperial Warrant reacht to none but her. Arc. All falshood; Nicias, keep your charge secure, When safety is restor'd us with the day, We'll leave this place of horror, and inflict Those pains at leisure, which their crimes require. The Roman Senate shall the Traytors Judge. Enter Eud. Well, Sir, you seem to have affairs of haste, Which claim immediate Audience: so have we. Who's this with out our leave, presumes to wear The Seal of Empire, which alone is ours, And in our name to visit him, whom these In strict Confinement hold? Eud. My Lord, Deceit's a stranger to this place, but where Our business calls us, we wou'd think at least This house was free, the rest I owe to you. In peace I kept my Flocks before, and beg That I again may hold my Crook in peace. For if my hands a Soveraigns Scepter weild, My heart will long to have a Soveraigns Right. Arc. Princes you are, yet all depend on us, As we on Heaven depend, nor dare you claim A Soveraigns pow'r, where we are pleas'd to reign. Eud. Happy ye Swains! who on the Mountain live, Lords of your homely Cells, your Cells are yours, And none disputes your right to govern there. Oh had you left me to my self, this Vale, The purchase of my labour, had been still The bounds of my Ambition; but my Ear Charm'd with a Princes name, has taught my Soul To think indeed that I am here to reign. Arc. We are not now to ask you whence this wealth, The Fleeces must be fine which yield such Gold, Not that of Colchos was a richer prize. A Guest shou'd only wonder, and as yours, All curious inquisition we forbear; And while you're flusht with infant Grandeur, leave Such questions to some other place, and hour, Tho you, who can protest against our sway, And in our presence tell us what we ought. Possest of these, and visions of your right, May once grow dangerous, Sir, you rise too fast. This we can pardon, but provokt again, You may be sent to murmur with your Friend. Eud. He is my Friend, which soon th'astonisht world Shall see: nor wou'd he thus have us'd a wretch VVho su'd for Justice. I cou'd tell what name The men of antient Greece had giv'n to Kings, VVho to their Subjects wrongs wou'd thus reply. Go on—and listen to your Minions Tales. Howe'er, remember you too late shall know, Whom you have wrong'd, and curse their pois'nous tongues Arc. This Minute then we'll know. Guards! Enter Alcan. Eud. Off ye Slaves! For by the Majesty that awes my arm, He dies that in my house insults me first. Arc. The Shepherd rages, leave him, he'll grow cool, Rome is a milder air, and good to cure Distempers, which like his have seiz'd the blood. Ex. Arc. and Train. Eud. Must we like Captives then be led to Rome? VVait on his Chariot-wheels in chains, like those His Sword has conquer'd in the Field. This morning Sun beheld me on a Throne, And oft his beams reflected on my Brows, Have borrow'd lustre from the Crown I wore. And must I like a purchas'd Slave, be linkt With him, whom Nature and Desert have made My Friend, who suffers all, and dies for me? Must this inevitably be, and I Submit with patience? Curst be him who wears The marks of Bondage when he might be free. Alcander, are our Friends prepar'd? Alc. They are. All arming for your rescue, but in vain, Thé Roman Guard of every Pass possest, Opposes all assistance from without, A while to enter 'twas deny'd to me; Hadn't their Captain known me well, I scarce My self had been allow'd to bring this news. Eud. Who now will doubt to what this treatment tends, We have been flatter'd with fallacious smiles, Till things were ready for our solemn fall. Why asks he not for her, whose crime his wrath Once swore he neither wou'd forgive in her, Nor in her memory; does his heart relent, And are we only destin'd to Revenge. So well I love Aurelia, I wou'd yield My self a Sacrifice for her with joy. Adrastus—Why must he be punisht first? 'Tis doubtful all but this—My friend's in Bonds, And calls aloud for Liberty on me. Oh had he known I tamely cou'd behold My Brother bound and murder'd, how my ear This morn had suffer'd with his just reproach. One way is left us still, if that shou'd fail, We'll charge the Roman Guard, and dye like men, Tho Conquest oft has waited on Despair. Alcander—let Dametas with his Band Be ready, and assoon's the alarm is heard Attack their Troop without, while I within Thro all that dare oppose us force my way: The rest we'll leave to fate. Howe're it ends, 'Tis brave to fall like Princes, and like Friends. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. The Palace. Scene an Apartment near the Emperor's. Parmenio solus. Par. Oh Guilt! Oh curst Remorse, the bane of rest, Which swims above my fairest hopes by day, And with black Visions haunts my dreams by night. But what is guilt, or what remorse to me? The Cowards terrour, and the Preachers hell. Words made to frighten fools, who dread the wheel: Conscience ne're meddles with successful crimes. The Conq'ror o're a thousand Murders sleeps, The Miser steals with pleasure to his wealth, Torn from the poor, and smiles with inward joy While he who wants those riches, views his sins With partial Eyes, and fancies then he feels The Fury's whip, when hunger only stings. Enter an Officer: Offi. Our Master's danger will excuse my haste, The Province is in arms, the foremost Guards Discover by the light of flaming Spears, Ten thousand men in martial order move, And tow'rds the Palace seem to bend their course. Par. I thank thee fate, this minute then is mine, It smiles propitious on my great designs. Their folly will dispose the world to think My Counsels just, and Heaven rewards my zeal. What strength can you oppose to theirs? Offi. At most Five hundred; but of these, the better half Are Friends and Neighbours, and require to know For whom they fight, and talk but ill of you. Par. No more—You speak as if you lik't their talk. Your Master soon will have it in his pow'r To punish such as question his commands Enter Eud. There are whose ears wou'd burn at such reports, This Souldier here shall teach 'em to obey, Correct their doubts, and lead 'em to the Foe. Nic. The Prince of Thrace, my Lord, demands to see The Emp'ror, and has something to impart Of high concern. Par. No, Nicias, 'tis in vain, The Emperor sleeps, and must not be disturb'd. Had he confest when favour took his part, His and his Friends dishonour had been sav'd. Amyntor's Subjects are, it seems, in arms, The Roman Guard in mutiny, and thou Canst only bring 'em to obedience Both. Go Leave the Thracian Prince to me. Nic. Knows not the Emp'ror of this strange revolt? Par. Scarce if he did, would he believe it true, His mercy finds excuses for his Foes. Oft, in his changing humour, he resolv'd, To free Adrastus, and perhaps my self Had for my care been sent to wear his bonds. Oh horror! that such goodness shou'd be wrong'd, By those his bounty had so lately rais'd. That in these shades, where virtue seems to dwell, The Vice of Fiends, Ingratitude, should reign. Go, Nicias, and be early in the War, Nor stay their Charge, the Rebels may disperse. And then we lose our moment of revenge. Fall on the rout, the victory's secure, Scarce worthy of thy Sword; but know that much Depends on this, and great is thy reward. Nic. I fly where most my Masters safety calls, And by the Empires Guardian Angel swear, The Traitors shall not scape, tho near the Throne. Ex. Nic. and Officer. Par. I like not that, this man was always brave, But honest always, and has known too much. No matter—He's remov'd, and now if Hell To glorious mischief ever was a Friend, Too morrow's Sun shall see me first in pow'r, And first in bliss of all the race of man. Enter Eud. What brings Amintor here? my Genius starts, Whene're we meet, his presence bodes me ill. Eud. I've business with the Emp'ror. Par. You're too late. Eud. 'Tis of importance to his Life and Fame. Par. To you, we know his Life and Fame are dear, You might have told him when you saw him last. Eud. Twas with a person I despise, and thought Unworthy of the secret. Par. Him you mean Has Slaves, who scorn a Traytors odious name, And of your secrets is too well inform'd. Eud. Ha! Have a care how thou insultst me here. Thou know'st thy Fate is in the Secret lodg'd. Be wise. My patience will not suffer long. Tempt me no more. Behold me yet at large, Lord of this place, and Soveraign here. Par. You talk indeed as if the World was yours: But men are ever fond of what is new. A Scepter looks but awkard in your hands, So lately sully'd with a Crook. This House Is yours, and this discourse becomes it well. Eud. I have no leisure to dispute, I came To see Arcadius. Par. I ne're ask'd for what. You might have spar'd this visit; 'tis a time For rest. Eud. I shall not see him? Par. No. Hoa, Guards. Enter Guards. Thro these and me you first shall force your way. Eud. By heav'n thou durst not trust his ears with truth! Par. I durst not trust him with the man whose Slaves, A numerous Host, declare against his life. Eud. Those Slaves shall quickly tear him from thy arms: Of thee the mischiefs of this hour are born, And thou severely shall account for all. Enter Alcander. Par. Convince the Senate whence these mischiefs rose. Hence! to your post, and watch with double care. [To the Guards Nor fear their numbers in so just a cause. Nations and Kings will in our quarrel rise, They've nothing to assist 'em but Despair. Exit with Guards. Eud. That portion e're the morning shall be thine: Hell ne're receiv'd a blacker Soul, nor Earth A more malicious Villain ever bred. Night wastes apace, and e're the day returns, There must be mighty changes in our Fates, For he or I no more shall see it dawn. What of Dametas, speaks Parmenio true? Alc. I left him in the Vale, ten thousand strong, Lycon attends you in the Citron Grove, With fifty chosen youth: The foe without Forget, or never knew that pass; within But five are posted at the Gate, and those We soon shall master, and with Lycon joyn. Eud. Thy news transports me, haste, secure the Guards, Be careful of their Lives, receive our Friends, Bar all the Palace Gates, and leave at each Sufficient strengrh, with charge to suffer none To enter or to pass, let Lycon know I wait his entrance in the Inner Court. Ex. Alcander. I'll meet the Emp'ror like an Emp'rors Son; Nor on his Pity, or his Daughters Tears, Depend for pardon when I most am wrong'd. Oh, my Adrastus, thou shalt see I still Am worthy of the Heroes of our race. I fly to bring thee Freedom. Ha, my Wife! Enter Aur. Phyl. Sylvia. Aur. Am I unwelcome to my Lord? Not thus He wou'd have met me when our Loves were young. Why sits such thoughtful sorrow on thy brow? My eyes were wont to kindle joy in thine. Am I the cause of these distracting cares? Am I more happy that my heart can find Relief in Love, and only think of thee? Have you not seen my Father? Eud. No, nor you. Nor must I see him, till Parmenio's pleas'd. So far I prest it, that the Guards were call'd To stop my passage—Where are now your hopes? The Traytor proudly told me 'twas too late, And bad me prove my innocence in Rome. Dametas with an Army is at hand, I will be heard, and will have Justice done. Aur. Dametas is at hand, you will be heard, This stile with thirty Legions would agree, We dream of dangers which our fears create; And reason yielding to those fears, the ills At last prove real that our fancies form'd Eud. Blame not a passion, which I learnt with love, Fear was till then a stranger to my Soul. I thought of losing you, and then I fear'd. 'Twas then I trembled first, forgot my Sex, And felt a woman's softness in my heart. Aur. Oh wou'd that softness argue with me now, For ever you must lose me, if you go. Against you Greece will send forth all her pow'rs, And Rome, her Sister, turn her force on you. Where will your Army fly for refuge then? Their Flocks and Herds, their Virgins and their Wives, Their Woods, their Groves, will be the Soldiers spoil, And this fair Land of pleasure then lye waste, While I abandon'd to my Father's rage, Expos'd to Death, or what is worse, am left, By all unpity'd, and by all forsook. Eud. Say, wou'd you have me led in chains to Rome, Shewn for a Monster to the gaping crowd, And with my Brother, on a Scaffold fall The Victim of a jealous Minions lust? The Emp'ror leaves us with the Rising day, My Foe is conscious of his guilt, and far Will keep me from his Master's Ear, till Rome Has seen my shame, and we can ne're be friends. Oh no, Aurelia, things must ne're be thus, Adrastus must be safe, Arcadius undeceiv'd. His honour's equally concern'd with mine, Both by a perjur'd Villain are abus'd, And by this Sword we will have justice both. Farewel—To please thee wou'd be ruin, But not to please thee I must hear no more. Aur. Stay, my Eudosius, stay, he's gone, he's gone To certain Death, nor gave a parting kiss, Nor close embrace, but tore him from my arms, My longing arms, that ne're must clasp him more. What, am I grown a burden to his Heart, Have I for this endur'd a Parents curse? For this the Kingdoms of the world refus'd, For this to Menial Offices comply'd, And been as much his Servant as his Wife. Oh man, oh false ungrateful man! Oh thou Of all thy Sex most false, and most ingrate, Where hast thou left me? but no matter where, Since to be left for ever is a fate, No circumstance of Woe can render worse. My Father soon will seek me in his wrath, And when his hard reproaches wound my ear, Hadst thou been near me to relieve my shame, And in thy bosom hide me from his frown, His awful Brow had shot its darts in vain. But now, thus destitute of help from thee, My crimes appear so black, my Judge so fierce, I dye with terrour, e're my doom is read. Phy. When by our griefs, our reason is opprest, How weak are all our arguments, how vain, Has he not suffer'd equally with you, And I who have no interest but yours, Have not I had my share, and yet ev'n now, When most I suffer, I repent it least: Was nothing to his Brothers Injuries due, Must poor Adrastus still remain in chains, Or for his freedom wait his Rivals Nod? Aur. Too morrow I had past thro Swords and Spears, Thro pointed Deaths, and at my Fathers feet Implor'd his pity, clung about his knees, And of my Mothers beauteous Image full, Hung on his neck, and bath'd it with my tears, Till to our wish I had inclin'd his Soul. But oh my Husbands useless Fury adds New Fuel to his Flame, when Peace was nigh. Phy. Cease, cease, these mournings, all things will be well. The War is with Parmenio, not his Lord. The Emp'ror will himself applaud his Son, And when he sees his Favorite's curst designs, Throw him with horrour from his arms. Par. (within) Oh my Philante! Phy. Heard you not a voice? Aur. I did, it nam'd you, and the sound came thence. Phy. Th'apartment where Adrastus is confin'd. Sure 'rwas his Genius, or my own, that call'd, To warn me of our danger. Oh my heart! Why sinks it in my breast, why shake my limbs? Why these ill Bodings, if my Prince is safe? Oh no, I see the bloody hand advanc'd, The Dagger lifted high, his heart its aim. Stop, stop, inhuman Butcher, strike it here, The wound is mine, my Breast shall be his Shield. Sylv. How well we counsel others, and how ill, When our greifs disturb us, act our selves? Aur. Where e're we turn, we meet with new distress. New Scenes of woe, new Images of death. Fly, Sylvia, from this most unhappy wretch, This out-cast, this forsaken woman, fly, My Friendship ruins what it holds most dear. Syl. Madam, Retire, you're here too much exposd: Rous'd by the noise and perils of the night, The Emp'ror arm'd with Thunder will appear, And if he sees you in the first alarm, How fatal may the meeting be to both. Aur. Yes! here this Jove, this Thund'rer I'll expect, I'll stand between my Lord and him, and bear The dreadful weight of his resentment here. On me the Tempest first shall break, on me The edge of his insufferable rage Shall fall, till thus it strikes me to the Earth. falls. Thus low I'll bless him with my latest sighs, And pray that his revenge may end with me. Enter Emp. and Nic. Sylv. Oh save us, ye immortal powers, he comes. Arc. Is he not dead? Nic. No. Arc. Bring him forth. Nic. My Lord! The poison's in his brain, his Fancies rove On things extravagant, the Fever past, He may e're death be sensible and calm. What dropt from him before was only this, Parmenio left the Cristal Bowl with him, Commanding when you call'd to give it you. Arc. Parmenio? Nic. Yes, Parmenio. Arc. Have a care, To name him thus is death, Nic. I'll mark the man. Then call him what you please, my Lord, 'twas he That from a Soldier rais'd me to command: To this high post, and plac'd me near the Throne. 'Twas he, that from as vile Conditions rose, By Cæsar's favour next to Cæsar's rank. 'Twas he that counsell'd you to break the league, And seize Adrastus in profoundest peace. 'Twas he that charg'd me when the truth was known, To fix this Dagger in his Rival's heart, Then swear to you he gave the blow himself. 'Twas he that bid me lead your Guards, and waste This Land with unexpected War. 'Twas he That left you to the service of his Slaves: For I in disobedience to his will, Unknown to him within the Palace stay'd, To watch your sleep, which else had been your last. When Hell and darkness tempted him abroad, To execute the Treasons he had form'd. 'Twas he, that when Amintor would have shewn, How foul, how false, the charge against him was, Withstood his entrance, and by open force Compell'd the Prince by force to make his way. But oh! Great Emp'ror, what need I more, 'Twas he by whom that high-born Princess dies, In whose fresh youth divine Pulcheria lives. Sylv. Help! help! the Princess faints. Arc. Oh Heav'n! oh Joy! Swoons Tis she, I know 'tis she, I feel her here, Nature speaks loud, and points me to my Child. Oh Daughter! oh Aurelia! oh my Tongue Is lost with rapture, but with this, and this, Embrace. Once more I'll give thee life—she lives, she lives, Thus lookt Pulcheria when she lookt her last, That dying glance restores her to my Heart, Which weaken'd with excess of joy, grows sick. Faints. Nic. My Lord, my Emp'ror! Aur. Where am I? Is not this the Land of Peace, Where all things are forgiv'n, all are blest, Did not my Father call me Child? Syl. He did. Behold him in your arms with transport lost. Aur. Oh Father, Father. Arc. Art thou then awake? Aur. Forgive my heart, 'tis yet so busie, Sir, My sins are banisht thence, and I can spare No time to beg your pardon. Arc. Name no more What I shou'd ask, for all that's past was mine; I speak not of thy Husband, he's my friend, A thousand things to my remembrance bring Both him and thee: The Signet, this retreat, The flying rumours that Eudosius liv'd, His Brothers Friendship, and the Princes Love, Confirm these wonders. Go Nicias, go my Souldier, seek my Son, Go tell him how my arms are fill'd, and say While they want him I think 'em empty still. Ex. Nic. Oh had we met before! But then, my Child. The great discovery we have made to night Had still been distant, and Parmenio lov'd. I bred and nurst a Serpent in my breast, Whose venom'd sting against my life was aim'd. Aur. We knew you wou'd not always hate us, Sir; Nor drive your Children from you, and e're morn Had told the secret with a kind surprize, Had not his jealousie contriv'd these ills, And fill'd this house with sorrow and despair. Enter Officer. Offic. My Lord, I waited on Parmenio's Slave, Catcht his last words, and thus he dying said, My Master put the Potion in the Cup, I, curious of its richness, tasted, drank, Fell down, when Nicias entring broke the Bowl. Arc. See that he scapes not: Bear him to the Rack. I cou'd almost forgive him his offence Ex. Offic. To me: But what he meant my Children rhrows Him far from mercy. A Shout. Enter Eudosius, throws down his Sword, and kneels at the Emperors feet. Oh my Son. Eud. My Emp'ror, my Father, can you hear That word from me, and still preserve your smile? Arc. Oh talk of nothing but of bliss to come, Let dark oblivion bury what is past, And perfect as our blessing be our joy, The world has nam'd your Vertues with applause, More to your merit than your birth you owe. Take, take your Wife, and be for ever blest. Eud. Oh my Aurelia! have we liv'd to see This hour, and must we live another still. Forgive me, Sir, all Extasy is rude; 'Tis new, we ne're cou'd thus embrace before, Nor hope a blessing on the Nuptial Bed. Nic. within. Bear down the Doors, the Pillars and the Walls, Aur. Oh 'tis Phylante's voice. A Woman shrieks. Arc. The kind companion of your youth. Aur. Tis her's, The Traytor loves her, and I dread his lust. Shriek. Within. Help, help, the Prince, Phylante. Eud. Ha, I'm wing'd To rescue thee, and pray it be'nt too late. Arc. How near destruction have I blindly walkt. Exit. Aur. Phylante, oh my Sister. Eud. within. Seize on the Traytor, and unbind the Prince, Throw wide the doors, and let the Fiend be seen. Scene opens, Adrastus appears (unbinding) Phlyante in disorder, Parmenio (held by Soldiers) disfigur'd as by a woman, Nicias, Officer and all come forward. Eud. My Brother! Adr. My Deliverer! Phyl. My Preserver! Eud. See, Your Duty to the Emp'ror first. Arc. Come to my arms, if you can think that one Who much has wrong'd you, can deserve your love: And thou, my other Daughter, welcome here. To Torture with that Villain, Whips and Death, Slow lazy Deaths, away— Guards carry off Par. Phyl. Words are not black enough to paint his Crimes. When in this place we parted last, I went [To Aur. And found, alas! the Voice I heard was his. He seiz'd me, caught me to his arms, and said, He knew me when I visited the Prince. He told me if I'd yield to be his Wife, The morn should find me Mistress of the world: For, as he swore, the Emp'ror was no more. If not, he wou'd by force enjoy his wish, When for my honour, and the Princes life, To Eud. Your timely succour came. Arc. No tears, Phylante! now, no sighs but such As Lovers when th' expected minute comes Can spare. To you, Adrastus, I am sure, This present will be welcome. Take her, Prince, Our self will witness to your Nuptial Vows; Thou, Nicias, to whose Loyalty we owe Life, Children, Empire, all, thou next to these In favour and in Friendship shalt be first. Thrace shall again behold her darling Lord, Whose Crown shall hence be regal, and the bounds Of this fair Province, which I gave my Son, Far as the Adriatick shall extend. This to Adrastus, with his Bride I give. Renew the sports these tumults have disturb'd, With double Lustre gild the face of night, That day approaching, may with wonder see Alight Superiour to his own. Eud. &amp; Aur. Hear us, Oh Father! grant our last request, (kneeling.) Suffer no limits to your goodness, long This Garden has been ours, and sweet its walks; To leave these Shades, and launch into the world, Looks frightful to our Natures, fond of rest. Oh let Adrastus wear the Crown of Thrace, This people and this Valley only ours, Where hand in hand, we may frequent its Groves, Talk of past changes, and rejoice in this. There with the morning and the Evening Sun, With pray'rs for you and Greece we'll visit Heav'n: Nor will we here be negligent of fame; For Love and Glory shall divide our care. And thus like persons who have reacht the shoar, With pleasure we'll look back upon the Waves, And hear the Billows roar, and see 'em foam, While we securely tread the solid Main. Arc. Of this hereafter we'll resolve. Eud. And now Let all our Military Train disperse, Let only those who wait upon our sports Attend, let Love and Mirth succeed our Cares, And Arms and Battles yield to softer Wars.

      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Writ by Mr Farquhar. Time was when Poets rul'd without disputes, Turn'd Men to Gods, transform'd their Gods to Brutes. Our Poets change the Scene, with mighty odds Make Men the Brutes, make nothing of their Gods. 'Tis strange to see by what surprizing skill, Things are transforme'd by Brothers of the Quill. No more than this—high—Presto—pass, Great Jupiter's a Bull—Great Beaux's an Ass. Whene'er they please to give their thoughts a loose, Jove's made a Swan, your Alderman's a Goose. Things of most differing forms too we may find, By spells of Poetry in one combin'd. The blustering Face, which Red-Coats bear about, Is the false Flag which Cowards still hang out, And that shall huff, and rant, swear loud and ban, Hector his God, and yet be kickt by Man. They make the Villain look precise and grave, And the poor harmless Cit, a thriving Knave. Strange contradictions! reconcil'd we see, They sometimes make even Man and Wife agree. Poets of Old chang'd Io to a Cow, But what strange Monsters Women are made now? Females with us, without the Poet's fraud, Change often to the worst of Beasts, a Bawd. There are but two things from all change secure, Nought can transform a Poet or a Whore. Others for being chang'd, their Stars may blame, Their punishment is this—still they're the same, Like paint on Glass that's valu'd at such cost; Poets ne're fade, altho the Art be lost. FINIS.</field>
