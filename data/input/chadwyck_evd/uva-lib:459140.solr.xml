      <field name="fulltext">Act 1. Sce: 1. Ent: Don Pedro Gusman; Henrico, &amp; Manuell, his sons; Don Fernando &amp; Eleonora, his Daughter; &amp; Teniente. Ped: Gentlemen, y'have much honourd me to take [my] such entertainement, but y'are welcome all; twas my desire to have yor Company at parting, heaven knowes when we shall meete againe. Ten: you are for France then too? Man. I wayte on my father. Ped: Henrico? Fer: Eleonora? Ten: But how chance, Manuell, yor yonger brother is at ye Goale before you? what, no Lady to please yor eye? Man: I am not yet weary of my freedome; may Henrico meete Ioy in his Election; yet I know not one I would sooner chuse to call a Sister, then Eleonora. Ped: At my returne from france all things shall bee consummate, in meane time let yor owne hearts knilt wt h ye strongest tye of love; be merry, in mutuall embraces, &amp; let yor prayers fill or departing sayles; our stay will not be long; &amp; ye necessity of my affaires vnwillingly doth take me from you. Hen: Though I could wish yor stay, my duty bidds me expect ye enioying of my happines till yor returne from france; yor blessing. Eleo: How ever heaven dispose of Eleonora, pray write me in yor thoughts, yor humblest daughter; that shall make it a part of her devotions to pray for you. Fer: well sir, since your designe calls you away, may yor good Angell guard you; Ten: The like wish I, don Pedro. Fer: Manuell, I hope you will not long breath out of Spanish Ayre; farewell. Ped: my thankes to all.âstay Peeces Dischargd. Fer: The Captaine of ye Castle come to interprete Ent: Bustamente. that [new] language to vs; what newes? Bust: Such as will make all Spaine dance in Canary; ye Brasile fleete. Fer: Arriv'd? Bust: Is putting into harbour, &amp; aloud calls for a Midwife, she is great wt h [Child] gold &amp; longs to be delivered. Ped: No he Spanyard Is not a true reioycer at ye newes, be't a good Omen to our Iourney. Ten: So we wish all. Ped: May we, at or returne, meet no worse newes then now at parting; my noble Don fernando &amp; Teniente, once more farewell; (my daughter, I hope,) Eleonora, Henrico. nay yor good newes deserves a farewell. Bust: A soldiers farewell, a fast hand [to both] &amp; heart; good fate to both. Hen: Come Elinor, let them discourse their Ioyes Ex: Pedro &amp; Manuell. for ye safe fleete; In thee all my delights embarke themselves. Bust: Tush, lett 'em come, or shipps have brought wt h them the newes of warre. Fer: what is that, Gentlemen? Ten: I am speaking of a fleete of Enemyes. fer: from whence? Ten: from England. Fer: A Castle in ye Ayre. Ten: Doe you not beleive it? Fer: I heard such a report but had no faith in't; a meere Pot gun. Bust: nay sir, tis certaine there hath bene great prparation if our Intelligence be true to vs; &amp; a mighty Navy threatens ye Sea. Fern: what's that to vs: how long hath it bene a voyce [t] they were at sea? I have venturd to discharge ye soldiers; wc h to keepe here in pay vpon ye rumour of a great fleete a comming, would both pester the Towne, &amp; be vnne[s]cessary charge to ye king or master. Ten: But how if they intend vs? Fer: Tis not probable; the time of yeare is past sir now, more then [y] the middle of October; had they meant vs, we should have heard their message in loud Cannon before this time. Bust: I am of that opinion. Ten: But Don fernando &amp; Bustamente, call to mind the time hath bene when we supposed too the season past, they have saluted vs wt h more then frendly Bulletts, tore ye ribbs of or Towne vp; made every house too hott for ye Inhabitants, had a spoyle of all spight of or hearts. fer: One Swallow makes not Su?er; because once or City was their prize, is't of necessity it must be so againe? Bust: or were ye Navy greater, as fame gives out it is ye fayrest that ever dancd vpon these Seas, why yet should we suspect for this Citty? fer: because we dreame soe. Ten: If you did dreame, it may be as neere truth; I wish ye contrary; but know them daring Enemyes. fer: The world, we doe acknowledge, cannot boast more resolution then ye English hearts seasond for Action. Ten: francisco Bustamente? how is ye Castle? what strength? Bust: A fort impregnable, wanting neyther soldiers nor munition. Ten: Well, looke to't. Fer: How ere that wilbe necessary, ye fort lyes in ye mouth of danger, &amp; it will become you to discharge that duty, Bustamente. Bust: wt h my best Care. Ten: I wish all well, &amp; that you had not yet discharg'd yor Companyes, Don Fernando. fer: Come come, putt off yor Ielousy, drinke downe ye remembrance, we forget our fleetes arrivall; send yor feares away, nothing but wine &amp; mirth should crowne this day. Exeunt. Sce: 2. Ent: Two Devonshire Merchants, as being in Sherryes. [.1.] Heare you ye newes? .2. yes, that an English fleete Is making vp to Cales. .1. our Sherryes merchants though few of vs be heere, shall soundly pay to the furnishing of this Navy. .2. nay, I assure you our shipps wilbe fast bound by Spanish Charmes not to gett hence in hast. .1. The Divell allready is furling vp ye sayles; would all ye sackes wc h we have bought for England were in Devonshire turnd to small Beere, so we were but in Tavestoke to see it drawne out, were it nere so thin; I'de drinke a health to all ye Dons in Sherryes &amp; cry a pox vpon 'em. .2. That word heard by any lowsy Spanish Picardo were worth or two neckes; Ile not curse my Diegoes, but wish wt h all my heart that a faire wind may wt h great Bellyes blesse our English sayles both out &amp; In; &amp; that ye whole fleete may be at home deliverd of no worse a Conquest then ye last noble voyage made to this Citty, though all ye wines &amp; merchandize I have here were i'th'Seas bottome. .1. Troth so would I mine. .2. I nere could tell yet from what roote this huge large spreading Tree of hate from Spayne to vs, from vs againe to Spayne, tooke ye first growth. .1. No? then Ile tell you; let vs season or sorrow wt h this discourse. .2. wt h all my heart I long for't. .1. you shall not loose yor longing; then sir, know the hate a Spanyard beares an Englishman nor naturall is, nor ancient; but as sparkes flying from a flint by beating, begett flames, matter being neere to feed &amp; nurse ye fire, so, from a Tinder at ye first kindled, grew this heartburning twixt these Two great Nations. .2. As how pray? .1. heare me; any Englishman that can but read or Chronicles, can tell that many of or Kings &amp; noblest Princes have fetcht their best &amp; royallest wives from Spayne; the very last of all binding both kingdomes wt hin one golden ring of love &amp; peace by the marriage of Queene Mary wt h that little man (but mighty Monarch) Phillip, son &amp; heire to Charles ye Emperour. .2. you say right. .1. Religion having but one face [here] then both here &amp; there; both Nations seemd as one; Concord, Commerce, &amp; sweete Co?unity were Chaynes of Pearle about ye neckes of eyther; But when England threw of ye yoake of Rome, Spayne flew from her, Spayne was no more a Sister nor a neighbour, but a sworne Enemy: All this did but bring dry stickes to kindle fire, now see it burne. .2. And warme my knowledge &amp; experience by't. .1. Spaines anger never blew hott coales indeed till in Queene Elizabeths Raigne, when, (may I call [I] him so?) that glory of his Country &amp; Spaynes terror, that wonder of ye land, &amp; ye Seas minyon, Drake, of eternall memory, harrowed th'Indyes. .2. The king of Spaynes west Indyes? .1. yes, when his Ilands, Nombre de Dios, Cartagena, Hispaniola, wt h Cuba &amp; ye rest of those faire Sisters, the mermaydes of those Seas, whose golden stringes give him his sweetest musicke, when these were ravishd by Drake &amp; his brave Ginges, when these red Apples were gather'd, &amp; brought hither to be payr'd, then ye Castilian Lyon began to roare. .2. Had he not cause, being vexd soe? .1. when or shipps carryed such fire drakes in them, that ye huge Spanish Galleasses, Galleons, Hulkes &amp; Carrackes, being great wt h gold, in labour wt h some fright, were all delivered of fine red cheekt Children at Plymouth, Portsmouth, &amp; other English Havens, &amp; onely by men midwives: had not Spayne reason to cry out, oh Diablos Ingleses? .2. It had not spoke such Spanish else. .1. When we did sett our feete even on their Mynes &amp; brought their golden fagotts thence, their Ingotts, &amp; silver wedges; when each ship of ours was able to spread sayles of silke; the Tacklings of twisted gold; when every marryner at his arrivall here had his deepe pockets crammd full of Pistoletts; when ye poorest ship Boy might on ye Thames make duckes &amp; drakes wt h pieces [,] of Eight, fetchd out of Spayne; These were ye Bellowes, wc h blew ye Spanish bonfires of revenge: these were ye times in wc h they calld or Nation Boracho's, Lutherans, &amp; furias del' Inferno. .2. would we might now give them ye selfe same cause to call vs soe. .1. the very name of Drake was a Bugbeare to fright Children; Nurses still'd their little Spanish Nynnyes when they cryde hush, ye Drake comes. .2. All this must needs beget their mortall hate to vs. .1. It did; yet then we lovd them beyond measure. .2. why? .1. why did not Spaine fetch gold from ye West Indies for vs to spend here merrily? she planted Vines we eate ye Grapes; she playd ye Spanish Pavine vnder our windowes, we in or bedds lay laughing to heare such Mynstrelsy. .2. how then turnd ye windes? why did this beauteous face of love in vs putt on so blacke a Visour of hate to them? .1. Oh sir, doe but looke backe to Eighty Eight, that Spanish glasse shall tell you; shew each wrinckle. England, that yeare, was but a Bitt pickd out to be layd on their kinges Trencher: who were their Cookes? marry sir, his Grandees, &amp; great Dons of Spaine. A Navy was provided, a royall fleete, infinite, for ye bravery of Admiralls, Vice Admirall, Generalls, Colonells &amp; Commanders, soldiers, &amp; all ye war like furniture cost or experience, or mans witt could muster for such a mayne designe. .2. Stay, Eighty Eight? Thirty eight yeares agoe; much about then came I into ye world: well sir, this fleete. .1. wc h made ye Sea [first,] fish wonder what new kingdome was building over theirs, beate downe ye Billowes before them to gett thither; twas such a Monster in body; such a wonder in ye Eyes, &amp; such a Thunder in ye eares of Christendome, that ye Popes Holynes would needes be Godfather to this most mighty big limbd Child, &amp; call it th'Invincible Armado. .2. That's to say A fleete of shipps not to be overcome by any power of man. .1. These were ye Whales these were ye huge Levyathans of ye Sea wc h roaring came wt h wide &amp; dreadfull Iawes to swallow vp our kingdome, shipps, &amp; Nation. The fame of this Armado flew wt h Terror riding on Envyes [backe] wing; the prparation was wayted on wt h wonder, &amp; the approach shew'd ye grim face of horror; yet, gainst all these our Country &amp; or Courages were armd. 2. St. George for England. .1. And St. George we cryde albeit, we heard, ye Spanish Inquisition was aboord every ship, wt h Torture, torments, whipps strung wt h wyre, &amp; knives to cutt or throates. But from ye armed winds an hoast brake forth wc h tare their shipps, &amp; sav'd ours: thus I have read[,] Two storyes to you; one, why Spayne hates vs, t'other why we love not them. .2. oh sir, I thanke you. Exeunt. Sce: 3. Ent: Teniente, Don Iohn, Henrico. Ten: I ever feard some ill fate pointed at this Citty. Io: makes ye fleete this way? Hen: Buzzano? Ten: I did dreame every night of't, &amp; ye Ravens wt h their vnlucky throates never leave croaking some danger to vs all. Hen: where's Buzzano? villaine, Io: Be not discomforted. Ten: Don Fernando too hath cutt or strengths off, taken away or swords should save or throates: I did priudicate too rashly of ye English, now we may yleid vp ye Towne; Sirra, gett you up Ent: Buzzano. to th'highest Turret yt lookes three leagues into the Sea, &amp; tell vs what you can discover there. Buz: why I can tell you ere I goe. Hen: what? Buz: why there are fishes &amp; shipps too in ye Sea, they were made for that purpose. Ten: The fellow doates; climbe quickly sirra, &amp; tell vs whither any bend to this place; there's a fleete abroad, skud rascall. Hen: Villayne away, &amp; cast yor eyes into the Sea.

Buz: That's another matter, I will overlooke you all prsently. Exit. Io: What were I best to doe? I doe not like these Navyes. Hen: Tis past question, if they were kenn'd this way that they intend to make another meale of this Citty. Ten: The first was but a Breakefast, they have shrewd stomakes; oh, for a lusty storme to bury all their hopes in the waves now; one good swelling Gust would breake their ribbs in pieces. Ent: Buzzano above. Io: No witches abroad? Buz: I see, I see, I see. All: What? Buz: nay, I cannot tell what yet. something it is; I thinke it be a Towne. Hen: Some Iland in ye Sea?

Ten: Speake sirra. Buz: If you would peace, I might heare what they say, the wind serves to bring every word they speake; they make towards, yes, towards this Citty. A great fleete; stay, stay, looke to yor selves Dons, they spitt fire allready, &amp; have hung vp a thousand flaggs of defyance.

El: Since I must be yor prisoner; let me have my Keepers Company: for I am afraid some Enemy, in yor absence, like a wolfe, may ceize on me; I know not whither more I ere shall see my father; doe not you ravish yor selfe from me; for at ye worst we may dye here Henrico; and I had rather fall in your eye then in yor absence be dishonord; if ye destinyes have not spun out or longer threads let's dye together. Hen: Oh doe not racke my soule wt h these sad accents Am I Henrico? There's not any place can promise such security as this to Eleonora; doe not talke of dying, our best dayes are to come; putt on thy quiet &amp; be above ye reach of a misfortune: Ile prsently wayte on thee; by this kisse. Buz: would I might keepe yor oath; so please you, Lady, Buzzano will sweare too. Hen: What? B: that you'le be there &amp; here agen presently. H: Attend her sirra. Buz: If you must needs goe, pray sir keepe yor selfe out of Gun-shott. H: mind you yor charge. Buz: you shall heare a good report of my piece I warrant you. take heed you be not sent to heaven wt h a powder, A company of hott shotts are abroad I can tell you. El: if you will goe, may yor successe be faire. Hen: farewell, heaven cannot chuse but heare yt prayer. Exit. Buz: Now what please you, Madam? that I shall Amble, Trott, or walke? El: Any pace. Buz. yet if you would referre it to me, I'de vse none of them. El: what wouldst doe? Buz: why I would Gallop or run, for I thinke long till I be at home, in or Castle of comfort. If it please you Ile lead you a hand gallop, madam, in ye plaine ground, trott vp hill wt h you, &amp; racke downewards. El: Talke not of rackes, prithee, the times prsent too many. Buz: ride me as you will then, I am vsd both to Curbe &amp; snaffle. El: I prithee tell me, Buzzano, so I heare thy Master call thee. Buz: He may call me at his pleasure forsooth. El: Dost thou know ye nature of ye English? Buz: Both men &amp; weomen; I travelld thither wt h an Embassador; for ye men, Ile not misse you a haire of their Condition; and for ye weomen, I know 'em as well as if I had bene in ye i r bellyes. El: Are they not cruell? Buz: As Tygers when they set on't, no mercy, vnlesse we aske them forgivenes. El: That's somewhat yet. Buz: but not to you, that's onely to men; for lett ye weomen fall downe afore 'em never so often, they'le rather fall vpon them: nay, some of them are so spitefull they'le breake their owne backes before they'le let 'em rise againe. El: foole, I meane not your way. Buz: keepe yor owne way madam, I meane ye playne way. El: Are they not vnmercifull in their natures to such as are in ye i r power? their Enemyes, as we may be? Buz: Their enemyes as we may be in their power? I had rather be cramm'd into a Cannon, &amp; shott against ye i r ships, then you should prove a witch &amp; tell true now. The Tartar is not halfe so grim; not a Turke would vse vs so like Iewes as they will. If it come to that once, that they take ye Towne, you shall see Spanish Dons heads cryed vp &amp; downe as they doe our Orenges &amp; Lymons. And ye weomens heads shall off too, not a maydenhead of gold shall scape 'em. El: It is no valor to vse Tyranny vpon ye conquerd; they have bene reported A noble Nation: and when last ye pride of this Citty adornd their victory, by co?and of their brave Generall, no outrage ever the soldiers durst co?itt vpon our persons; though all or wealth ran in full streames vpon them our honours were prservd, or fame belyes them. Buz: no matter what fame sayes, perhaps I know more then she does; &amp; yet, now you talke of valour, they are not comparable to vs. El: How? Buz: why valor is but ye courage of a man; courage is, as they say, [the] ye spirit of a man; &amp; ye spirit of a man is ye greatnes, as we call it, of his stomacke; now, tis well knowen to ye whole world they feed better, &amp; eate more then we, Ergo, we have better stomackes then they. But see, we have talk't or selves at home already; &amp; ye point is open, will't please you enter? or shall I enter before you? I am yor man madam. El: you know ye way best; whil'st abroad they are at fight, twixt hope &amp; feare at home I warre. Exeunt.</field>

Ped: oh, my son, my son, horror it selfe vpon ye wings of Death stretcht to ye vttermost expansion, over ye wounded body of an Army, could never carry an Aspect like this; this murthering spectacle, this field of paper stucke all wt h Basiliskes eyes: Read but this word, The ravisht Eleonora:âdoes't not seeme like a full cloud of bloud ready to burst &amp; fall vpon or heads? Man: Indeed you take too deepe a sence of it. Ped: What? when I see this meteor hanging ore it? this prodigy in figure of a man? clad all in flames wt h an Inscription blazing on's head; Henrico ye Ravisher. Man: Good sir, avoid this passion. Ped: In battailes I have lost &amp; seene ye falls of many a right good soldier; but they fell like blessed grayne yt shott vp into honor: But in this leud exploit I lose a son &amp; thou a brother, my Emanuell, &amp; or whole house ye glory of her name; her beauteous name, yt never was distaynd, is, by this beastly fact, made odious. Man: I pray sir be yor selfe, &amp; let yor Iudgement entertaine reason; from whom came this Letter? Ped: from ye sad plaintiffe Eleonora. Man: Good; &amp; by ye co?on poast; you every weeke receiving letters from yor noble frends yet none of their papers can tell any such Tidings. Ped: All this may be too sir. Man: Why is her father silent? has she no kindred, no frend, no gentleman of note, no servant whom she may trust to bring by word of mouth her dismall story! Ped: no, ?haps she would not text vp his name in proclamations. Man: Some Villaine hath filld vp a Cup of poyson t'infect ye whole house of ye Gusman family; &amp; you are greedyest first to take it downe. Ped: That villaine is thy brother. Man: were you a stranger armd in ye middle of a great Battalia &amp; thus should dare to taxe him, I would wave my weapon ore my head to waft you forth to single Combate; if you would not come, had I as many lives as I have hayres I'de shoot 'em all away to force my passage through such an hoast vntill I mett ye Traytor to my deare brother; pray doe not thinke so sir. Ped: Not? when it shall be said one of or name (oh heaven could I but say he were not my son) was so dishonorable, so sacrilegious, to defile a Temple of such a beauty &amp; goodnes as she was? Man: As beauteous is my brother in his soule as she can bee. Ped: Why dost thou take his part so? M: Because no dropp of honor falls from him but I bleed wt h it; why doe I take his part? my sight is not so precious as my brother; If there be any goodnes in one man he's Lord of that, his vertues are full Seas, wc h cast vp to ye shoares of ye base world all bodyes throwne into them; he's no Drunkard, I thinke he nere swore oath; to him a woman was worse then any Scorpion, till he cast his Eye on Elionora; &amp; therefore sir I hope it is not so. Ped: was not she so? M: I doe not say, sir, that she was not so, yet weomen are strang creatures; but my hope is that my brother was not so ignoble. Good sir be not too credulous on a Letter, who knowes but it was forgd, sent by some foe, as ye most vertuous ever have ye most; I know my Brother lov'd her honor so as wealth of Kingdomes could not him entice to violate it or his faith to her: Perhapps it is some queint devise of theirs to hast yor Iourney homeward out of france, to terminate their long-desired marriage. Ped: The language of her letter speakes no such comfort; but I will hasten home; &amp; for you are so confident, as not to thinke his honor any way toucht, yor good hopes be yor guide, auspiciously to find it to yor wish. Therefore my Counsaile is you post before &amp; if you find yt such a wrong be done, let such provision instantly be betwixt you made to hide it from ye world by giving her due nuptiall satisfaction, that I may heare no voice of't at my co?ing.

Hen: first call my fathers man in. Clark: what's his name? H: Buzzano. Cla: Call Buzzano in. Buz: here I am here. Ent: Buz: Cl: Stand out; whither goe you? Buz: to stand out. Cla: stand there. Mac: Now, what can he say? Hen: first, my Lords, heare mee; my brother &amp; I lying in one Bed together, &amp; he iust vnder vs. Buz: In my flea bitten Trundlebed. Cl: peace, sirra. Hen: about midnight I awaking &amp; this Buzzano too, my Brother in his sleepe thus cryde out; oh twas I that murtherd him, this hand that killd him. Gyr: heard you this, sirra? Buz: As sure as I heare you now. Alq: And you'le be sworne twas he yt so cryde out? Buz: If I were going to be hangd Ide sweare. Clar: forbeare ye Court. Exit Buzzano. Mac: All this is but prsumption; if this be all the shott you make against him, yor bullets sticke in a mud wall, or if they meete resistance they backe rebound &amp; fly in yor owne face. Med: Bring yor best forces vp, for these are weake ones. Hen: Then here I throw my Glove, &amp; challenge him to make this good vpon him; That at comming home he first told me my father dyed in france; then, some houre after yt he was not dead, but that he left him [at] [in] Lorraine [in] at Nancy; then at Chaalons in Burgundy, &amp; lastly, he said to Don fernando he was in Paris. fer: He did indeed. Mac: What then? Hen: Then, when in's Chamber we were going to bed, he suddainely lookd wild, catchd me by the hands, And falling on his knees, wt h a pale face &amp; troubled conscience, he Confessed he killd him, nay swore he basely murtherd him. Mac: what say you to this? Alq: Now he comes close vp to you. Man: he is my murtherer, for I am none, so lett my Innocence guard me; I never spake wt h a distracted voice, nere fell to him, on my knees; spake of no father, no murther'd father: he's alive as I am, &amp; some foule Divell stands at yt fellowes elbow Iogging him to this mischiefe; the Villaine belyes me, and on my knees, my lords, I beg that I &amp; my white Innocence may tread yt path beaten out before vs by that man, my Brother; Co?and a Case of Rapiers to be sent for, &amp; lett me meete his daring; I know him valiant, but I am doubly armd, both wt h a Courage fiery as his can be, &amp; wt h a Cause that spitts his accusation full in the face. Mac: The Combate in this Case cannot be granted, &amp; here's ye reason: when a man accuses a frend, much [fo] more a brother, for a fact so foule as murther, (murther of a father) the Law leapes straight way to ye Challenger, to take his part; Say he yt does accuse should be decrepitt, lame &amp; weake, or sickly, the other strong &amp; lusty; thinke you a kingdome will hazard so a Subiect, when ye quarrell is for a kingdomes right? if y'are so valiant you then must call ye law into the feild, but not ye man. Man: I have done, let law proceed. Mac: This cannot serve yor turne; say he does belye you, he stakes against yor body his owne soule: Say there is no such murther, yet ye Law fastens on you; for any man accusd for killing of his father may be rackd to draw Confession from him; will you Confesse? Man: I cannot, must not, will not. Mac: Iaylor, take &amp; prpare him for ye racke. wele see it done here. Hen: you are righteous Iudges. Man: Oh villaine, villaine, Villaine. Exit [c?] wt h ye Iaylor. Med: Where's the wrongd Lady? Alq: stand you still at ye Barre. you are now another man sir, yor scale turnes. fernando fetches in Eleonora. Mac: Looke on ye Prisoner, doe you know him Lady? Eleo: would I had nere had cause to say I know him! Mac: Of what doe you accuse him? Eleo: As ye murtherer both of my name &amp; honor; In ye hurry, when ye Citty (they said) was ready to be taken, I being betrothd to this yong Gentleman, my father brought me to his fathers house, telling me there dwelt safety, there dwelt villany, Treason, lust, basenes; for this godlesse man (ye storme being ore), came in &amp; forcd from me the Iewell of my Virgen honor. Hen: false. Fer: I would not have thee thinke (thou graceles wretch) she, being contracted to thee, loving thee, loving thee far more dearely then her selfe, would wound her vertue soe, so blott her fame, &amp; bring a scandall on my house &amp; me were not ye fact most true. Hen: most false, by all yt ever man can sweare by; we falling out, I told her once I nere would marry her &amp; so she workes this mischiefe. Gyr: you here stand chargd for ravishing her, &amp; [she] you must marry her, or she may have yor life. Mac: Lady, what say you? wc h had you rather have,? his life or him? Eleo: I am not cruell; pay me my first Bond of mariage, wc h you seald to, &amp; I free you, &amp; shall wt h Ioy run flying to yor armes. All: Law you? Mac: That's easy enough. Hen: Rackes, Gibbett?, wheeles make sausages of my flesh first, Ile be ty'd to no mans Strumpet. Alq: Then you must looke to dye. Mac: Lady, wt hdraw. Hen: well if I doe, somebody shall packe. El: Oh me vnfortunate Creature! Exit. Ent: Manuell to be rackt, Iaylor, &amp; Officers. Med: Don Manuell Gusman, ere you tast ye tortures, wc h you are sure to feele, will you confesse this murther of yor father? Man: Pray give me privacy a litle wt h my Brother. All. take it.

All. What sayes he! Hen: Cunning, cunning, cunning Traytor! In my eare he confesses all againe, &amp; prayes me to speake to you. Mac: will you openly confesse? Man: No, no, I cannot; Caytiffe I spake not soe; I must not wound my Conscience, to lay on it a guilt it knowes not; Ile not so dishonor my father, nor my Ancestor s before me, nor my posterity wt h such an Earthquake, to shake our noble house. Mac: Give him ye Law, then. Man: Ile meete a Thousand deaths first, Hen: Plucke, &amp; plucke home, for he's a murtherous Villaine. Man: Thou worse, a Divell. Mac: Racke him. Man: Oh stay, for heavens sake spread yor mercy, I doe confesse ye murther, I killd my father. All: Take him off. Man: This hand stabbd him. Mac: Where? Man: Neere St. Germains in Paris, in a darke night, &amp; then I fled. Mac: Thy owne tongue is thy Iudge, take him away, to morrow looke to dye; send him a Confessor. Iay: Ile have a holy care of him. Exit Manuell led by ye Iaylor. Hen: Who's now my lords ye Villaine? Ent: Eleonora &amp; Buzzano. El: Oh Iustice, here's a witnesse of my Rape. Mac: Did you see't sirra? Buz: See't, no sir, would I had; but when she was in labour, I heard her cry out helpe, helpe; &amp; ye Gamboll being ended, she came in like a mad woman, ruffled &amp; Crumpled, her haire about her eares; &amp; he all vnbrac'd, sweating as if he had bene thrashing: &amp; afterwards he told me, my lords, yt he had downe didd'led her. Hen: I now am lost indeed, &amp; on my knee beg pardon of yt goodnes, that pure Temple wc h my base lust prophand; &amp; will make good my wrongs to her by mariage. Mac: what say you, Lady? El: He spurnd my mercy when it flew to him, &amp; courted him to kisse it; therefore now Ile have his life. Fer: That life, so had, redeemes thine &amp; thy fathers infamy; Iustice, my Lords. Hen: Cruell Creature. Mac: Take him away, &amp; lead him to his brother, you both must dye next morning. Hen: I deserve it, And so that Slave too, yt betrayd his Master. Buz: Why should not I betray my Master, when he betrayed his Mistris? Cl: Gett you gone sirra. Exeunt Henrico, &amp; Buzzano. Mac: you are dismissd faire Lady; you shall have Law, yor Ravisher shall dye. El: Oh that my life from death could sett him free. Exit. Mac: Pray, Don Fernando, follow her, &amp; soften her heart to pitty ye poore gentleman, the Crime is not so Capitall. Fer: Ile doe my best.
