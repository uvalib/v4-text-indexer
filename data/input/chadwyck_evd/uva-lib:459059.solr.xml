      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. That part of Rome near the Tiber. Enter Flavius and Caska, on one Side, and Carpenter, Cobler, and Mob shouting on the other. Flav. Hence: Home you idle Creatures, get you Home: Is this a Holiday? What, know you not (Being Mechanical) you ought not walk Upon a labouring Day, without the sign Of your Profession? Speak, What Trade art thou? Car. Why Sir, a Carpenter. Cas. Where is thy Leather Apron, and thy Rule? What dost thou with thy best Apparel on? You Sir! What Trade are you? Cobl. Truly Sir, in respect of a fine Workman, I am but as you would say, a Cobler. Cas. But what Trade art thou? Answer me directly. Cobl. A Trade Sir, that I hope I may use, with a safe Conscience, which is indeed Sir, a Mender of bad Soles. Flav. What Trade thou Knave? Thou naughty Knave, What Trade? Cobl. Nay I beseech you Sir, be not out with me: Yet if you be out Sir, I can mend you. Cas. What mean'st thou by that? Mend me, thou sawcy Fellow! Cobl. Why Sir, Cobble you. Flav. Thou art a Cobler, art thou? Cobl. Truly Sir, all that I live by is with the Awl: I meddle with no Tradesmans Matters, nor Womens Matters; but With-awl I am indeed Sir, a Surgeon to old Shoes; when they are in great Danger, I recover them. As proper Men as ever trod upon Neats-Leather, have gone upon my Handy-work. Flav. But wherefore art not in thy Shop to day? Why do'st thou lead these Men about the Streets? Cobl. Truly Sir, to wear out their Shoes, to get my self into more Work. But indeed Sir, we make Holiday to see Cæsar, and to rejoice in his Triumph. Cas. Wherefore Rejoice? What Conquests brings he Home? What Tributaries follow him to Rome? To grace in Captive bonds his Chariot Wheels? You Blocks, you Stones, you worse then sensless Things; O you hard hearts! you cruel Men of Rome! Knew you not Pompey? many a time and oft, Have you climb'd up to Walls and Battlements, To Tow'rs and Windows? Yea, to Chimney tops, Your Infants in your Arms, and there have sate The live-long Day, with patient expectation, To see great Pompey pass the Streets of Rome: And when you saw his Chariot but appear, Have you not made an Universal shout, That Tyber trembled underneath her banks To hear the replication of your sounds, Made in her Concave Shores? And do you now put on your best Attire? And do you now cull out a Holiday? And do you now strew Flowers in his way? That comes in Triumph over Pompey's Blood? Be gone! Run to your Houses, fall upon your Knees, Pray to the Gods to intermit the Plague That needs must light on this Ingratitude. Flav. Go, go, good Countrymen, and for this fault Assemble all the poor Men of your sort; Draw them to Tyber banks, and weep your Tears Into the Channel, till the lowest Stream Do kiss the most exalted Shores of all. [Exeunt Mob. See where their basest mettle be not mov'd, They vanish Tongue-ty'd in their guiltiness. Go you down that way towards the Capitol, This way will I: Disrobe the Images, If you do find them deck'd with Ceremonies. Cas. May we do so? You know it is the Feast of Lupercal. Flav. It is no matter, let no Images Be hung with Cæsars Trophies: I'll about, And drive away the Vulgar from the Streets; So do you too, where you perceive them thick. These growing Feathers, pluck'd from Cæsars wing, Will make him flie an ordinary pitch, Who else would soar above the view of Men, And keep us all in servile fearfulness. [Exeunt, Severally. Enter Cæsar, Anthony, Calphurnia, Decius, Brutus, Cassius, Caska, a Soothsayer: Merellus, Trebonius, Flavius, and Lictors. Cæs. Calphurnia. Cask. Peace ho, Cæsar speaks. Cæs. Calphurnia! Calph. Here, my Lord. Cæs. Stand you directly in Anthony's way, When he doth run his Course. Anthony Ant. Cæsar, my Lord. Cæs. Forget not in your speed Anthony, To touch Calphurnia; for our Elders say, The Barren touched in this holy Chace, Shake off their sterile Curse. Ant. I shall remember, When Cæsar says, Do this; it is perform'd. Cæs. Set on and leave no Ceremony out. Sooth. Cæsar. Cæs. Ha! Who calls? Cask. Bid every noise be still; Peace yet again. Cæs. Who is it in the Press that calls on me? I hear a Tongue shriller then all the Rest Cry, Cæsar: Speak, Cæsar is turn'd to hear. Sooth. Beware the Ides of March. Cæs. What Man is that? Brut. A Sooth-sayer bids you beware the Ides of March Cæ. Set him before me, let me see his face. Cassi. Fellow, come from the Throng, look upon Cæsar. Cæs. What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again. Sooth. Beware the Ides of March. Cæs. He is a dreamer, let us leave him: Pass. [Exeunt. Manet. Brut. and Cassi. Cassi. Will you go see the Order of the Course? Brut. Not I. Cassi. I pray you do. Brut. I am not Gamesome: I do lack some part Of that quick Spirit that is in Anthony: Let me not hinder Cassius your desires; I'll leave you. Cassi. Brutus, I do observe you now of late: I have not from your Eyes, that gentleness And shew of Love, as I was wont to have: You bear too stubborn, and too strange a hand Over your Friend, that Loves you. Brut. Cassius, Be not deceiv'd: If I have veil'd my look, I turn the trouble of my Countenance Meerly upon my self. Vexed I am Of late, with Passions of some difference, Conceptions only proper to my self, But let not therefore my good Friends be griev'd (Among which number Cassius be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect, Then that poor Brutus with himself at War, Forgets the shews of Love to other Men. Cassi. Then Brutus, I have much mistook your Passion, By means whereof, this Breast of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy Cogitations. Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your Face? Brut. No Cassius. For the Eye sees not it self but by reflection, By some other things. Cassi. 'Tis just, And it is very much lamented, Brutus, That you have no such Mirror, as will turn Your hidden worthiness into your Eye, That you might see your shadow: I have heard Where many of the best respect in Rome, (Except immortal Cæsar) speaking of Brutus, And groaning underneath this Ages yoak, Have wish'd, that Noble Brutus had his Eyes. Brut. Into what Dangers, would you Lead me Cassius? That you would have me seek into my self, For that which is not in me? Cassi. Therefore good Brutus be prepar'd to hear: And since you know, you cannot see your self So well as by Reflection; I your Glass, Will modestly discover to your self That of your self, which yet you know not of. And be not jealous of me, gentle Brutus. Were I a common Laughter, or did use To stale with ordinary Oaths my Love To every new Protester: If you know, That I do fawn on Men, and hugg them hard, And after Scandal them: Or if you know, That I profess my self in Banquetting To all the Rout, then hold me dangerous. [a Shout within. Brut. What means this Shouting? I do fear, the People choose Cæsar For their King. Cassi. Ay, do you fear it? Then must I think you would not have it so. Brut. I would not Cassius, yet I love him well: But wherefore do you hold me here so long? What is it, that you would impart to me! If it be ought toward the general good, Set Honour in one Eye, and Death i'th'other, And I will look on both indifferent: For let the Gods so speed me, as I love The name of Honour, more then I fear Death. Cassi. I know that Vertue to be in you Brutus, As well as I do know your outward favour. Well, Honour is the subject of my Story: I cannot tell, what you and other Men Think of this Life: But for my single self, I had as lief not be, as live to be In awe of such a thing, as I my self. I was born free as Cæsar, so were you, We both have fed as well, and we can both Endure the Winters cold, as well as he. For once upon a Raw and Gusty Day, The troubled Tyber, chafing with her Shores, Cæsar said to me, dar'st thou Cassius now Leap in with me into this angry Flood, And swim to yonder Point? Upon the word, Accoutred as I was, I plunged in, And bad him follow: So indeed he did. The Torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it With lusty Sinews, throwing it aside, And stemming it with Hearts of Controversie. But e're we could arrive the Point propos'd, Cæsar cry'd, Help me Cassius, or I sink. I (as Æneas, our great Ancestor, Did from the Flames of Troy, upon his Shoulder The old Anchises bear) so, from the waves of Tyber Did I the tyred Cæsar: And this Man, Is now become a God, and Cassius is A wretched Creature, and must bend his Body, If Cæsar carelesly but nod on him. He had a Feaver when he was in Spain, And when the Fit was on him, I did mark How he did shake: 'Tis true, this God did shake, His Coward lips did from their colour flie, And that same Eye, whose Bend doth awe the World Did lose his Lustre: I did hear him groan: Ay, and that Tongue of his, that bad the Romans Mark him, and write his Speeches in their Books, Alas, it cryed, Give me some drink Titinius, As a sick Girl: Ye Gods, it doth amaze me, A Man of such a feeble Temper should So get the start of the Majestick World, And bear the Palm alone. [Shout agen. Brut. Another general Shout! I do believe, that these Applauses are For some new Honours, that are heap'd on Cæsar. Cassi. Why Man, he doth bestride the narrow World! Like a Colossus, and we petty Men Walk under his huge Legs, and peep about To find our selves dishonourable Graves. Men at some time, are Masters of their Fates. The fault (dear Brutus) is not in our Stars, But in our selves, that we are underlings. Brutus and Cæsar: What should be in that Cæsar? Why should that name be sounded more then yours? Write them together: Yours, is as fair a Name: Sound them, it doth become the Mouth as well. Weigh them it is as heavy: Conjure with 'em, Brutus will start a Spirit as soon as Cæsar. Now in the Names of all the Gods at once, Upon what Meat doth this our Cæsar feed, That he is grown so great! Age, thou art sham'd. Rome, thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods. When went there by an Age, since the great Flood, But it was fam'd with more then with one Man? When could they say (till now) that talk'd of Rome, That her wide Walks incompast but one Man? O! you and I, have heard our Fathers say, There was a Brutus once, that would have brook'd Th'eternal Devil to keep his State in Rome, As easily as a King. Bru. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous: What you would work me too, I have some aim: How I have thought of this, and of these times, I shall recount hereafter. For the present, I would not so (with love I might intreat you) Be any further mov'd: What you have said, I will consider: What you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear, and answer such high things. Till then, my noble Friend, depend on this: Brutus had rather be a Villager, Then to repute himself a Son of Rome Under these hard Conditions, as this time Is like to lay upon us. Cassi. I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much shew of fire from Brutus. [Shout and Flourish here. Brut. The Games are done, And Cæsar is returning. Cassi. As they pass by, Pluck Caska by the Sleeve, And he will (after his sour fashion) tell you What hath proceeded worthy note to Day. Enter Cæsar and Train as before. Brut. I will do so: But look you Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Cæsars brow, And all the rest, look like a chidden Train; Calphurnia's Cheek is pale. Cassi. Caska will tell us what the Matter is. Cæs. Anthony. Ant. Cæsar. Cæs. Let me have Men about me, that are Fat, Sleek-headed Men, and such as sleep a Nights; Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look, He thinks too much: Such Men are dangerous. Ant. Fear him not Cæsar, he's not dangerous, He is a Noble Roman, and well given. Cassi. Would he were fatter: But I fear him not: Yet if my Name were liable to fear, I do not know the Man I should avoid So soon as yon spare Cassius. He reads much, He is a great Observer, and he looks Quite thro' the Deeds of Men. He loves no Plays, As thou dost Anthony: He hears no Musick; Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mock'd himself, and scorn'd his Spirit That could be mov'd to smile at any thing. Such Men as he be never at Hearts ease, Whilst they behold a greater then themselves, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd, Then what I fear: For always I am Cæsar. Come on my right Hand, for this Ear is deaf, And tell me truly, what thou think'st of him. [Exeunt Cæsar and Train. Cask. You pull'd me by the Cloak, would you speak with me? Bru. Ay, Caska, tell us what hath chanc'd to day That Cæsar looks so sad. Cask. Why you were with him, were you not? Bru. I should not then ask Caska what had chanc'd. Cask. Why, there was a Crown offer'd him; and being offer'd him, he put it by with the back of his Hand thus, and then the People fell a Shouting. Bru. What was the second Shout for? Cask. Why, for that too Cassia. They Shouted thrice, what was the last Cry for? Cask. Why for that too. Bru. Was the Crown offer'd him thrice? Cask. Ay, marry was't, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other; and at every putting by, mine honest Neighbours shouted. Cassi. Who offer'd him the Crown? Cask. Why, Anthony. Brut. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Caska. Caska. I can as well be hang'd as tell the manner of it: It was meer Foolery, I did not mark it. I saw Mark Anthony offer him a Crown, and as I told you he put it by once: but for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he offered it to him again: then he put it by again: But to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his Fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time; he put it the third time by, and still as he refus'd it, the Rabble houted, and clapp'd their chop'd Hands, and threw up their sweaty Night-caps, and uttered such a deal of stinking Breath, because Cæsar refus'd the Crown, that it had (almost) choak'd Cæsar: For he swoun'd, and fell down at it: And for my own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of opening my Lips, and receiving the bad Air. Cassi. But soft I pray you: What, did Cæsar swound? Cask. He fell down in the Market-place, and foam'd at Mouth, and was speechless. Brut. 'Tis very like he hath the Falling-sickness. Cassi. No, Cæsar has it not: but you, and I, And honest Caska, we have the Falling-sickness. Cask. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Cæsar fell down. If the tag-rag People did not clap him, and hiss him, according as he pleas'd and displeas'd them, as they used to do the Players in the Theatre, I am no true Man. Brut. What said he, when he came unto himself? Cask. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceiv'd the Common Herd was glad he refus'd the Crown, he pluck'd me ope his Doublet, and offer'd them his Throat to cut; and had I been a Man of any Occupation, if I would not have taken him at his Word, I would I might go to Hell among the Rogues; and so he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, if he had done, or said any thing amiss, he desir'd their Worships to think it was his Infirmity. Three or Four Wenches where I stood, cried, Alas good Soul! and forgave him with all their Hearts: But there's no heed to be taken of them: If Cæsar had stab'd their Mothers, they would have done no less. Brut. And after that, he came thus sad away? Cask. Ay. Cassi. Did Cicero say any thing? Cask. Ay, he spoke Greek. Cassi. To what effect? Cask. Nay, and I tell you that, I'll ne're look you i'th'Face again. But those that understood him, smil'd at one another, and shook their Heads: but for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more News too: Merellus and Flavius, for pulling Scarfs off Cæsar's Images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more Foolery yet, if I could remember it. Cassi. Will you sup with me to Night, Caska? Cask. No, I am promis'd forth. Cassi. Will you dine with me to Morrow? Cask. Ay, if I be alive, and your Mind hold, and your Dinner worth the eating. Cassi. Good, I will expect you. Cask. Do so: farewell both. [Exit. Brut. What a blunt Fellow is this grown to be? He was quick Mettle when he went to School. Cassi. So he is now, in execution Of any bold, or noble Enterprize, However he puts on this tardy Form: This Rudeness is a Sawce to his good Wit, Which gives Men Stomach to disgest his Words With better Appetite. Brut. And so it is. For this time I will leave you. To Morrow if you please to speak with me, I will come to you: or if you will Come home to me, I will wait for you. Cassi. I will do so: till then, think of the World. [Exit. Brutus. Well Brutus, thou art Noble: yet I see Thy Honourable Mettle may be wrought From that it is dispos'd; therefore it is meet, That noble Minds keep ever with their Like: For who so firm, that cannot be seduc'd? Cæsar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humour me. I will this Night, In several Hands, in at his Windows throw, As if they came from the several Citizens Writings, all tending to the great Opinion That Rome holds of his Name: wherein obscurely Cæsar's Ambition shall be glanced at. And after this, let Cæsar seat him sure, For we will shake him, or worse Days endure. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The Forum, or Market-Place. Thunder, and Lightning. Enter Caska, and Trebonius meeting. Treb. Good even, brought you Cæsar home? Why are you breathless, why stare you so? Cask. Are not you mov'd, when all the sway of Earth Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Trebonius, I have seen Tempests, when the scolding Winds Have riv'd the knotty Oaks, and I have seen Th'ambitious Ocean swell, and rage, and foam, To be exalted with the threatning Clouds: But never till to Night, never till now, Did I go through a Tempest-droping-fire. Either there is a Civil Strife in Heaven, Or else the World too sawcy with the Gods, Incenses them to send Destruction. Treb. Why, saw you any thing more wonderful? Cask. A common Slave, you know him well by sight, Held up his left Hand, which did flame and burn Like twenty Torches joyn'd, and yet his Hand, Not sensible of Fire, remain'd unscortch'd. Besides (I ha' not since put up my Sword) Against the Capitol I met a Lyon, Who gaz'd upon me, and went surly by, Without anoying me. And there were drawn Upon a Heap, a hundred gastly Women, Transform'd with their fear, who swore, they saw Men, all in Fire, walk up and down the Streets. And Yesterday, the Bird of Night did sit, Even at Noon-day, upon the Market-place, Houting, and shrieking. When these Prodigies Do so conjoyntly meet, let not Men say, They are Natural: For I believe, they are portentous things Unto the Climate that they point upon. [Thunder. Treb. Indeed, it is a strange disposed time: But Men may construe things after their fashion, Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. Comes Cæsar to the Capitol to Morrow? Cask. He does: for he bid Mark Anthony Send Word to you he wou'd be there to Morrow. Treb. Good-night then, Caska: This disturbed Sky is not to walk in. Cask. Farewell Trebonius. [Thunder. [Exit Trebonius. Enter Cassius. Cassi. Who's there? Cask. A Roman. Cassi. Caska, by your Voice. Cask. Your Ear is good Cassius, what a Night is this? Cassi. A very pleasing Night to honest Men. Cask. Who ever knew the Heavens menace so? Cassi. Those that have known the Earth so full of Faults. For my part, I have walk'd about the Streets, Submitting me unto the perilous Night; And thus unbraced, Caska, as you see, Have bar'd my Bosom to the Thunder-bolt; And when the cross blew Lightning seem'd to open The Breast of Heaven, I did present my self Even in the Aim, and very Flash of it. Cask. But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heavens? It is the part of Men, to fear and tremble, When the most mighty Gods by Tokens send Such dreadful Heralds, to astonish us. Cassi. You are dull, Caska: And those sparks of Life, that should be in a Roman, You do want, or else you use not. Now could I (Caska) name to thee a Man, Most like this dreadful Night, That Thunders, Lightens, opens Graves, and roars, As doth the Lyon in the Capitol: A Man no mightier then thy self, or me, In personal Action; yet prodigious grown, And fearful, as these strange eruptions are. Cask. Indeed, they say, the Senators to Morrow Mean to establish Cæsar as a King: And he shall wear his Crown by Sea, and Land, In every place, save here in Italy. Cassi. I know where I will wear this Dagger then; Cassius from Bondage shall deliver Cassius: Therein, ye Gods, you make the weak most strong; Therein, ye Gods, you Tyrants do defeat. Nor Stony Towers, nor Walls of beaten Brass, Nor air-less Dungeon, nor strong Links of Iron, Can be retentive to the Strength of Spirit: But Life being weary of these worldly Barrs, Never lacks Power to dismiss it self. If I know this, know all the World besides, That part of Tyranny that I do bear, I can shake off at Pleasure. Cask. So can I: So every Bond-man in his own Hand bears The Power to cancel his Captivity. Cass. And why should Cæsar be a Tyrant then? Poor Man, I know he would not be a Wolf, But that he sees the Romans are but Sheep: He were no Lyon, were not Romans Hinds. Those that with haste wou'd make a mighty Fire, Begin it with weak Straws. What trash is Rome? What Rubbish, and what Offal? When it serves For the base matter, to illuminate So vile a thing as Cæsar. But, oh Grief! Where hast thou led me? I (perhaps) speak this Before a willing Bond-man: Then I know My Answer must be made. But I am arm'd, And Dangers are to me indifferent. Cask. You speak to Caska, and to such a Man, That is no flearing Tell-tale. Take my Hand: Be factious for redress of all these Griefs, And I will set this Foot of mine as far, As who goes farthest. Cassi. There's a Bargain made, Now know you, Caska, I have mov'd already Some certain of the Noblest-minded Romans To undergo, with me, an Enterprize, Of honourable, dangerous Consequence; And I do know by this, they stay for me In Pompey's Porch: Enter Cinna. Cask. Stand close a while, for here comes one in haste. Cassi. 'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his Gate, He is a Friend. Cinna, where haste you so? Cinna. To find out you: Who's that Metellus Cymber? Cassi. No, it is Caska, one incorporate To our Attempts. Am I not stay'd for Cinna? [Thunder. Cinna. What a fearful Night is this? There's two or three of us have seen strange Sights. Cassi. Am I not stay'd for? Tell me. Cinna. Yes, you are. O Cassius, If you could but win the Noble Brutus To our Party— Cassi. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this Paper, And look you lay it in the Prætor's Chair, Where Brutus may find it: And throw this In at his Window; set this up with Wax Upon old Brutus's Statue: All this done, Repair to Pompey's Porch, where you shall find us. Are Decius, Brutus and Trebonius there? Cinna. All, but Metellus Cymber, and he's gone To seek you at your House. Well, I will hie, And so bestow these Papers as you bad me. Cassi. That done, repair to Pompey's Theatre. [Exit Cinna. Come Caska, you and I will yet, e're Day, See Brutus at his House: Three parts of him Is ours already, and the Man entire Upon the next Encounter, yields him ours. [Exeunt. SCENE, A Garden. Enter Brutus. Brut. What Lucius, ho! I cannot, by the Progress of the Stars, Give guess how near to Day—Lucius, I say! I would it were my Fault to sleep so soundly. When, Lucius, when? awake, I say: What Lucius! Enter Lucius. Luc. Call'd you, My Lord? Brut. Get me a Taper in my Study, Lucius: When it is lighted come and call me here. Luc. I will, my Lord. [Exit. Brut. It must be by his Death: And for my part, I know no personal Cause, to spurn at him, But for the general. He would be Crown'd: How that might change his Nature, There's the Question? It is the bright Day, that brings forth the Adder, And that craves wary walking: Crown him And then I grant we put a Sting in him, That at his Will he may do danger with. And to speak truth of Cæsar, I have not known, when his Affections sway'd More then his Reason. But 'tis a common proof, That Lowliness is young Ambitions Ladder, Whereto the Climber upward turns his Face: But when he once attains the upmost Round, He then unto the Ladder turns his Back, Looks in the Clouds, scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend: So Cæsar may; Then lest he may, prevent. And since the Quarrel Will bear no Colour, for the thing he is, Fashion it thus; That when he is, augmented, Would run to these, and these Extremities: And therefore think him as a Serpent's Egg, Which hatch'd, would as his Kind grow mischievous, And kill him in the Shell. Enter Lucius with a Letter. Luc. The Taper burneth in your Closet, Sir: Searching the Window for a Flint, I found This Paper, thus seal'd up and I am sure It did not lye there when I went to Bed. Brut. Get you to Bed again, it is not Day: Is not to Morrow (Boy) the tenth of March? Luc. I know not, Sir. Brut. Look in the Kalender, and bring me Word. Luc. I will, Sir. [Exit. Brut. The Exhalations, whizzing in the Air, Give so much light, that I may read by them. [Opens the Letter, and reads. Brutus, thou sleep'st; awake, and see thy self: Shall Rome, &amp;c. speak, strike, redress, Brutus, thou sleep'st: Awake. Such Instigations have been often dropt, Where I have took them up: Shall Rome, &amp;c. Thus must I piece it out, Shall Rome stand under one Man's awe? What Rome! My Ancestors did from the Streets of Rome The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a King. Speak, strike, redress. Am I entreated To speak, and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise, If the Redress will follow, thou receivest Thy full Petition at the Hand of Brutus. Enter Lucius. Luc. Sir, March is wasted fifteen Days. Brut. 'Tis good. [Knocking without.] Go to the Gate, some Body knocks. Since Cassius first did whet me against Cæsar, I have not slept. Between the Acting of a dreadful Thing, And the first Motion, all the Interim is Like a Phantasma, or a hideous Dream. The Genius, and the mortal Instruments Are then in Council; and the State of Man, Like to a little Kingdom, suffers then The Nature of an Insurrection. Enter Lucius. Luc. Sir, 'tis your Brother Cassius at the Door, Who doth desire to see you. Brut. Is he alone? Luc. No, Sir, there are more with him. Brut. Do you know them? Luc. No, Sir, their Faces are buried in their Cloaks. That by no means I may discover them, By any Mark or Favour. Brut. Let 'em enter. [Exit Lucius. They are the Faction. O Conspiracy, Sham'st thou to shew thy dang'rous Brow by Night, When Evils are most free? O then, by Day Where wilt thou find a Cavern dark enough, To Mask thy monstrous Visage? Seek none Conspiracy, Hide it in Smiles, and Affability: For if thou put thy Native Semblance on, Not Erebus it self were dim enough, To hide thee from Prevention. Enter Cassius, Caska, Decius, Cinna, Metellus, and Trebonious. Cassi. I think we are too bold upon your Rest: Good-morrow Brutus, Do we trouble you? Brut. I have been up this Hour, awake all Night: Know I these Men, that came along with you? Cassi. Yes, every Man of them; and no Man here But Honours you: And every one doth wish, You had but that Opinion of your self, Which every Noble Roman bears of you. This is Trebonius. Brut. He is Welcome hither. Cassi. This, Decius Brutus. Cassi. He is Welcome too. Cassi. This, Caska; this, Cinna; and this Metellus Cymber, Brut. They are all Welcome. What watchful Cares do interpose themselves Betwixt your Eyes, and Night? Cassi. Shall I intreat a Word? [They whisper. Deci. Here lies the East: Doth not the Day break here? Cask. No. Cin. O Pardon, Sir, it doth, and yon grey Lines, That fret the Clouds, e're Messengers of Day. Cask. You shall confess, that you are both deceiv'd: Here, as I point my Sword, the Sun arises, Which is a great way growing on the South, Weighing the youthful Season of the Year, Some two Months hence, up higher toward the North He first presents his Fire, and the high East Stands as the Capitol, directly here. Brut. Give me your Hands all over, one by one Cassi. And let us swear our Resolution. Brut. No, not an Oath: If not the Face of Men, The Sufferance of our Souls, the times Abuse; If these be Motives weak, break off betimes, And every Man hence, to his idle Bed: So let high-seated Tyranny range on, Till each Man drop by Lottery. But if these (As I am sure they do) bear Fire enough To kindle Cowards, and to steel with Valour The melting Spirits of Women. Then Countrymen, What need we any Spur, but our own Cause, To prick us to redress? What other Bond, Then secret Romans, that have spoke the Word, And will not falter? And what other Oath Than Honesty to Honesty ingag'd, That this shall be, or we will fall for it. Swear Priests and Cowards, and such suff'ring Souls That welcome Wrongs: Unto bad Causes; swear Such Creatures as Men doubt; but do not stain The even Virtue of our Enterprize, Nor th'insuppressive Mettle of our Spirits, To think, that, our Cause, or our Performance Did need an Oath. When every drop of Blood That every Roman bears, Is guilty of a several Bastardy, If he do break the smallest Particle Of any Promise that hath past from him. Cassi. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him? I think he will stand very strong with us. Cask. Let us not leave him out. Cin. No, by no means. Metel. O let us have him! For his Silver Hairs Will purchase us a good Opinion: And buy Mens Voices, to commend our Deeds. Bru. O name him not; let us not break with him, For he will never follow any thing That other Men begin. Cassi. Then leave him out. Cask. Indeed, he is not fit. Deci. Shall no Man else be touch'd, but only Cæsar? Cassi. Decius well urg'd: I think it is not meet, Mark Anthony, so well belov'd of Cæsar, Should out-live Cæsar, we shall find of him A shrewd Contriver. And you know, his means If he improve them, may well stretch so far As to annoy us all: Which to prevent, Let Anthony and Cæsar fall together. Brut. Our Course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the Head off, and then hack the Limbs: Like Wrath in Death, and Envy afterwards: For Anthony is but a Limb of Cæsar. Let's be Sacrificers, but not Butchers, Caius: We all stand up against the Spirit of Cæsar. And in the Spirit of Men there is no Blood: O that we then could come by Cæsar's Spirit, And not dismember Cæsar! But (alas!) Cæsar must bleed for it. And gentle Friends, Let's kill him Boldly, but not Wrathfully: Let's carve him, as a Dish fit for the Gods, Not hew him as a Carkass fit for Hounds; This shall make our Purpose necessary, Which so appearing to the common Eyes, We shall be call'd Purgers, not Murderers. And for Mark Anthony, think not of him: For he can do no more than Cæsar's Arm, When Cæsar's Head is off. Cassi. Yet I fear him, For the ingrafted Love he bears to Cæsar. Brut. Alas! good Cassius, do not think of him: If he love Cæsar, all that he can do Is to himself; take thought, and dye for Cæsar; And that were much he should; for he is given To Sports, to Wildness, and much Company. Treb. There is no fear in him; let him not dye, For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter. [Clock strikes Three. Brut. Peace, count the Clock. Cassi. The Clock hath strucken Three. Treb. 'Tis time to part. Cassi. But it is doubtful yet, Whether Cæsar will come forth to Day, or no: For he is Superstitious grown of late, Quite from the main Opinion he held once, Of Fantasie, of Dreams, and Ceremonies: It may be, these apparent Prodigies, The unaccustom'd Terror of this Night, And the Persuasion of his Augurers, May hold him from the Capitol to Day. Deci. Never fear that: If he be so resolv'd, I can o're-sway him: For he loves to hear, That Unicorns may be betray'd with Trees, And Bears with Glasses, Elephants with Holes, Lyons with Toyls, and Men with Flatterers. But, when I tell him he hates Flatterers, He says, he does; being then most flattered. Let me work him, For I can give his Humour the true Bent: And I will bring him to the Capitol. Cassi. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him. Brut. By the eighth Hour, is that the uttermost? Cin. Be that the uttermost; and fail not then. Met. Caius Ligarius doth bear Cæsar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey, I wonder none of you have thought of him. Brut. Now good Metellus go to him from me: He loves me well, and I have given him Reasons, Send him hither, and I'll fashion him. Cassi. The Morning comes upon us: We'll leave you, Brutus, And Friends disperse yourselves; but all remember What you have said, and shew your selves true Romans. Brut. Good Gentlemen, look fresh and merrily. Let not our Looks put on our Purposes, But bear it as our Roman Actors do, With untyr'd Spirits, and formal Constancy. And so good-morrow to you every one. Om. Good Morning to Lord Brutus. [Exeunt Conspirators. Enter Portia. Por. Brutus, my Lord. Brut. Portia, What mean you? Wherefore rise you now? It is not for your Health, thus to commit Your weak Condition to the raw cold Morning Por. Nor for yours neither. Y'have ungently, Brutus, Stole from my Bed: And yesternight at Supper You suddenly arose, and walk'd about, Musing and sighing, with your Arms a-cross: And when I ask'd you what the Matter was? You star'd upon me, with ungentle Looks. Yet I insisted; yet you answer'd not, But with an angry Wafter of your Hand, Gave sign for me to leave you; So I did, Hoping it was but an Effect of Humour, Which sometime hath his Hour with every Man. It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep: And could it work so much upon your Shape, As it hath much prevail'd on your Condition, I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my Lord, Make me acquainted with your Cause of Grief. Brut. I am not well in Health, and that is all. Por. Brutus is wise, and were he not in Health, He would embrace the Means to come by it. Brut. Why so I do: Good Portia go to Bed. Port. What, is Brutus sick? And will he steal out of his wholsome Bed To dare the vile Contagion of the Night? And tempt the rheumy, and unpurg'd Air, To add unto his Sickness? No, my Brutus, You have some sick Offence within your Mind, Which by the Right and Vertue of my place, I ought to know of: And upon my Knees, I charm you, by my once commended Beauty, By all your Vows of Love, and that great Vow Which did incorporate and make us one, That you unfold to me, your self, your other half Why you are heavy; and what Men to Night Have had Resort to you; for here have been Some six or seven, who did hide their Faces Even from darkness. Brrt. Kneel not, gentle Portia. Por. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus. Within the Bond of Marriage, tell me Brutus, Is it excepted, I should know no Secrets That appertain to you? Am I your Self, But as it were in Sort, or Limitation? To keep with you at Meals, comfort your Bed, And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the Suburbs Of your good Pleasure? If it be no more, Portia is Brutus Harlot, not his Wife. Brut. You are my true and honourable Wife, As dear to me, as are the ruddy Drops That visit my sad Heart. Por. If this were true, then shou'd I know this Secret. I grant I am a Woman; but withal, A Woman that Lord Brutus took to Wife: I grant I am a Woman; but withal, A Woman well reputed: Cato's Daughter. Think you, I am no stronger than my Sex, Being so Father'd, and so Husbanded? Tell me your Counsels, I will not disclose 'em: I have made strong Proof of my Constancy. Giving my self a voluntary Wound Here, in the Arm: Can I bear that with Patience, And not my Husband's Secrets? Brut. O ye Gods! Render me worthy of this Noble Wife. [Knocking at the Gate. Hark, hark, one knocks: Portia go in a while, And by and by thy Bosom shall partake The Secrets of my Heart. [Exit. Portia. Enter Lucius, and Caius Ligarius. Luc. Who's that knocks? Luc. Here is a sick Man that would speak with you. Brut. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of. Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how; Cai. Vouchsafe Good-morrow from a feeble Tongue. Brut. O what a time have you chose out, brave Caius, To be distemper'd in. Would you were not sick. Cai. I am not sick if Brutus have in Hand Any Exploit worthy the Name of Honour. Brut. Such an Exploit have I in Hand, Ligarius, Had you a healthful Ear to hear it. Cai. By all the Gods that Romans bow before, I here discard my Sickness. Soul of Rome, Brave Son, deriv'd from Honourable Loins, Thou like an Exorcist, hast conjur'd up My mortified Spirit. Now bid me run, And I will strive with things impossible: What's to be done? Brut. A Piece of Work, That will make sick Men whole. Cai. But are not some whole, that we must make sick? Brut. That we must also. What it is, my Caius, I shall unfold to thee, as we are going, To whom it must be done. Cai. Set on your Foot, And with a Heart new-fir'd, I follow you, To do I know not what: but it sufficeth, That Brutus leads me on. Brut. Follow me then. [Thunder and Lightning. SCENE, Cæsar's Pallace. Enter Julius Cæsar. Cæsar. Nor Heaven, nor Earth, Have been at Peace to Night: Thrice hath Calphurnia, in her Sleep cryed out; Help, ho! They murther Cæsar! Within there! Enter a Servant. Ser. My Lord. Cæs. Go bid the Priests do present Sacrifice, And bring me their Opinions of Success. Ser. I will, my Lord. [Exit. Enter Calphurnia. Cal. What mean you Cæsar, think you to walk forth? You shall not stir out of your House to Day. Cæs. Cæsar shall forth; the things that threaten me, Ne're look but on my Back: When they shall see The Face of Cæsar, they are vanished. Calph. Cæsar, I never stood on Ceremonies, Yet now they fright me: There is one within, Besides the things that we have heard and seen, Recounts most horrid Sights seen by the Watch. A Lioness hath whelped in the Streets, And Graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their Dead; Fierce fiery Warriours fight upon the Clouds, In Ranks and Squadrons, and right form of War, Which drizel'd Blood upon the Capitol: The noise of Battel hurtled in the Air; Horses did neigh, and dying Men did groan, And Ghosts did shriek and squeal about the Streets. O Cæsar, these things are beyond all use, And I do fear them. Cæs. What can be avoided Whose End is purpos'd by the mighty Gods? Yet Cæsar shall go forth: For these Predictions Are to the World in general, as to Cæsar. Calp. When Beggars dye, there are no Comets seen, The Heavens themselves blaze forth the Death of Princes. Cæs. Cowards dye many times before their Deaths, The Valiant never taste of Death but once: Of all the Wonders that I yet have heard, It seems to me most strange that Men should fear, Seeing that Death, a necessary End, Will come when it will come. Enter a Servant. What say the Augurers? Ser. They would not have you to stir forth to Day. Plucking the Entrails of an Offering forth, They could not find a Heart within the beast. Cæs. The Gods do this in shame of Cowardise: Cæsar should be a Beast without a Heart If he should stay at home to Day for fear; No, Cæsar shall not. Calph. Alas my Lord, Your Wisdom is consum'd in Confidence: Do not go forth to Day: Call it my Fear, That keeps you in the House, and not your own. We'll send Mark Anthony to the Senate-House, And he shall say, you are not well to Day: Let me upon my Knee prevail in this. Cæs. Mark Anthony shall say I am not well, And for thy Humour, I will stay at home. Enter Decius. Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so. Deci. Cæsar, all hail! Good morrow worthy Cæsar, I come to fetch you to the Senate-house. Cæs. And you are come in very happy time, To bear my greeting to the Senators, And tell them that I will not come to Day: Cannot, is false; and that I dare not, falser: I will not come to day, tell them so Decius. Calp. Say he is sick. Cæs. Shall Cæsar send a Lye? Have I in Conquest stretch'd my Arm so far, To be afraid to tell Gray-beards the Truth! Decius, go tell them, Cæsar will not come. Deci. Most mighty Cæsar, let me know some Cause, Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell 'em so. Cæs. The Cause is in my Will, I will not come, That is enough to satisfie the Senate. But for your private Satisfaction, Because I love you, I will let you know. Calphurnia, here my Wife stays me at home: She dream'd to Night, she saw my Statue, Which like a Fountain, with an hundred Spouts, Did run pure Blood; and many lusty Romans Came smiling, and did bath their Hands in it; And these does she apply, for Warnings and Portents, And Evils imminent; and on her Knee Hath begg'd, that I will stay at home to Day. Deci. This Dream is all amiss interpreted, It was a Vision, fair and fortunate: Your Statue spouting Blood in many Pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bath'd, Signifies, that from you great Rome shall suck Reviving Blood, and that great Men shall press For Tinctures, Stains, Relicks, and Cognisance. This by Calphurnia's Dream is signified. Cæs. And this way have you well expounded it. Deci. I have, when you have heard what I can say. The Senate have concluded To give this Day a Crown to mighty Cæsar. If you shall send them word you will not come, Their Minds may change. Besides, it were a mock Apt to be render'd, for some one to say, Break up the Senate, till another time: When Cæsar's Wife shall meet with better Dreams. If Cæsar hide himself, shall they not whisper Lo! Cæsar is afraid. Pardon me Cæsar, for my dear, dear Love To your Proceeding, bids me tell you this: And Reason to my Love is liable. Cæs. How foolish do your Fears seem now, Calphurnia, I am asham'd I did yield to them, For I will go. Enter Publius. And look where Publius is come to fetch me. Pub. Good-morrow, Cæsar. Cæs. Welcome Publius. Enter Brutus. What Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too? Enter Caska and Ligarius. Good-morrow Caska, Caius, Ligarius; Cæsar was ne're so much your Enemy, As that same Ague which hath made you lean. What is't a Clock? Brut. Cæsar, 'tis strucken Eight. Cæs. I thank you for your Pains and Courtesy. Enter Anthony. See, Anthony that Revels long a Nights, Is notwithstanding up—Good morrow, Anthony. Anth. So to most noble Cæsar. Cæs. Bid them prepare within. Enter Cinna Metellus, Cymber and Trebonius. I am to blame to be thus waited for. Now Cinna, now Metellus: What, Trebonius, I have an Hours Talk in store for you. Remember that you call on me to Day. Be near me, that I may remember you. Treb. Cæsar I will. Cæs. Good Friends, go in, and taste some Wine with me, And we, like Friends, will straightway go together. Brut. O Cæsar! The Heart of Brutus earns to think upon thee. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Enter Soothsayer, reading a Paper. Sooth. “Cæsar, beware of Brutus, take heed of Cassius, “Come not near Caska; have an Eye to Cinna, “Trust not Trebonious, mark well Mettelus Cymber, “Decius Brutus loves thee not—Thou hast “Wrong'd Caius Ligarius—There is but one Mind “In all these Men, and it is bent against Cæsar. “If thou bee'st not Immortal, look about thee, “Security gives way to Conspiracy—The mighty “Gods defend thee—Thy Lover, Artemidorus. Here will I stand, till Cæsar pass along, And as a Suitor will I give him this. My Heart laments, that Virtue cannot live Out of the Teeth of Emulation. If thou read this, O Cæsar, thou may'st live, If not, the Fates with Traytors do contrive. [Exit. Enter Portia, and Lucius. Port. I prithee Boy, run to the Senate-House, Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone, Why dost thou stay? Luc. To know my Errand, Madam. Port. I wou'd have had thee there, and here agen, E're I can tell thee what thou should'st do there: O Constancy, be strong upon my Side, Set a huge Mountain 'tween my Heart and Tongue, I have a Man's Mind, but a Woman's Might; How hard it is for Women to keep Counsel. Art thou here yet? Luc. Madam, what shou'd I do; Run to the Capitol, and nothing else; And so return to you, and nothing else. Port. Yes, bring me Word (Boy) if thy Lord looks well, For he went sickly forth; and take good note, What Cæsar doth, what Suitors press to him. Hark Boy, What Noise is that? Luc. I hear none Madam. Port. Prithee listen well. I hear a bustling Rumour, like a Fray, And the Wind brings it from the Capitol. Luc. Indeed Madam, I hear nothing. Enter Soothsayer. Port. Come hither Fellow, Which way hast thou been? Sooth. At my own House, good Lady: Port. What is't a Clock? Sooth. About the ninth Hour, Lady. Port. Is Cæsar yet gone to the Capitol. Sooth. Madam, not yet—I go to take my Stand To see him pass on to the Capitol. Port. Thou hast some Suit to Cæsar, hast thou not? Sooth. That I have Lady, if it will please Cæsar To be so good to Cæsar, as to hear me; I shall beseech him to befriend himself. Port. Why, know'st thou any harm's towards him? Sooth. None that I know will be, Much that I fear may chance. Good-morrow to you. Here the Street is narrow, The Throng that follows Cæsar at the Heels, Of Senators, of Prætors, common Suitors, Will crowd a feeble Man almost to Death. I'll get me to a Place more void, and there Speak to Great Cæsar as he comes along. [Exit. Port. I must go in; Ay me! How weak a thing The Heart of Woman is! O Brutus! The Heav'ns speed thee in thine Enterprize. Sure the Boy heard me—Brutus hath a Suit That Cæsar will not grant: O I grow faint! Run Lucius, and commend me to my Lord, Say I am merry, Come to me agen, And bring me Word what he doth say to thee. [Exeunt. Enter Cæsar, Brutus, Cassius, Caska, Decius, Metellus, Trebonious, Cinna, Anthony, Lepidus, Publius, and Soothsayer. Cæs. The Ides of March are come. Sooth. Ay Cæsar, but not gone. Hail Cæsar, read this Schedule. Deci. Trebonius doth desire you to o're-read At your best Leisure, this his humble Suit. Sooth. O Cæsar, read mine first—for mine's a Suit. That touches Cæsar nearer—: Read it Great Cæsar. Cæs. What touches us, our self shall be last serv'd. Sooth. Delay not Cæsar; read it instantly. Cæs. What is the Fellow mad. Cassi. What, urge you your Petitions in the Street, come to the Capitol. Enter Popilius Lena. Pop. I wish your Enterprize to Day may thrive. Cassi. What Enterprize, Popilius? Pop. Fare you well. Brut. What said Popilius Lena? Cassi. He wish'd to Day our Enterprize might thrive, I fear our Purpose is discover'd. Brut. Look how he makes to Cæsar—mark him. Cassi. Caska be sudden, for we fear Prevention. Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known, Cassius or Cæsar never shall turn back, For I will slay my self. Brut. Cassius be constant; Popilius Lena speaks not of our Purpose, For look he smiles, and Cæsar doth not change. SCENE draws, and discovers the Capitol; they seat themselves. Cassi. Trebonius knows his time—for look you Brutus, He draws Mark Anthony out of the way. Deci. Where is Metellus Cymber? Let him go, And first prefer his Suit to Cæsar. Brut. He is address'd—press near, and second him. Cin. Caska, you are the first that rears your Hand: Cæs. Are we all ready? What is now amiss That Cæsar and his Senate must redress. Met. Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Cæsar, Metellus Cymber throws before your Seat An humble Heart. Cæs. I must prevent thee, Cymber: These Crouchings, and these lowly Courtesies Might fire the Blood of ordinary Men, And turn pre-ordinance, and first decree Into the Lane of Children—be not fond To think that Cæsar bears such rebel Blood That will be thaw'd from the true Quality With that which melteth Fools, I mean, Sweet Words, Low crooked Courtesies, and base Spaniel fawning: Thy Brother, by Decree is banish'd: If thou dost bend and pray, and fawn for him, I spurn thee, like a Curr, out of my way, Know, Cæsar doth no Wrong, nor without Cause, Will he be satisfy'd. Met. Is there no Voice more worthy than my own, To sound more sweetly in Great Cæsar's Ear. For the repealing of my banish'd Brother. Brut. I kiss thy Hand, but not in Flattery Cæsar, Desiring thee, that Publius Cymber may Have an immediate Freedom of Repeal. Cæs. What, Brutus! Cassi. Pardon Cæsar; Cæsar Pardon! As low as to thy Feet doth Cassius fall, To beg Enfranchisement for Publius Cymber. Cæs. I could be well mov'd if I were as you, If I cou'd pray to move, Prayers wou'd move me; But I am constant as the Northern Star, Of whose true Fixt, and resting Quality, There is no fellow in the Firmament. The Skies are painted with unnumber'd Sparks, They are all Fire, and every one doth shine, But there's but one in all doth hold his place. So in the World, 'tis furnish'd well with Men, And Men are Flesh and Blood, and apprehensive, Yet in the number, I do know but one That unassailable holds on his Course, Unshak'd of Motion; and that one am I Let me a little shew it, ev'n in this: That I was constant Cymber shou'd be banish'd, And constant do remain to keep him so: Cin. O Cæsar! Cæs. Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus? Deci. Great Cæsar! Cæs. Doth not Brutus bootless kneel— Cask. Speak Hands for me! [Stabs him Cæs. Et tue Brute! Then falls Cæsar— [dies Cassi. Some to the common Pulpit, and cry out Liberty, Freedom, and Enfranchisement— Brut. People and Senators, be not affrighted; Fly not, stand still—Ambition's Debt is paid— Cask. Go to the Pulpit Brutus— Deci. And Caissus too: Brut. Where's Publius? Cin. Here, quite confounded with this Mutiny— Brut. Publius, Good Cheer, There is no harm intended to your Person Nor to any Roman else—So tell them Publius. Cassi. And leave us Publius. Brut. Do so, good Brutus, and let no Man abide this Deed, But we the Doers— Enter Trebonius. Cassi. Where is Anthony? Treb. Fled to his House amaz'd; Men, Wives, and Children, stare, cry out, and run, As it were Doom's-day. Brut, Fates, we will know your Pleasures; That we shall dye we know, 'tis but the time And drawing Days out, that Men stand upon. Cask. Why he that cuts off twenty Years of Life, Cuts off so many Years of fearing Death— Brut. Grant that, and then is Death a Benefit. So are we Cæsar's Friends, that have abridg'd His time of fearing Death—Stoop Romans, stoop, And let us bathe our Hands in Cæsar's Blood, And all besmear our Swords, Then walk we forth, ev'n to the Market-place, And waving our red Weapons o're our Heads, Let's all cry Peace, Freedom, and Liberty. Cassi. How many Ages hence Shall this our lofty Scene be acted over In States unborn, and Accents yet unknown. Brut. So many times shall Cæsar bleed in Sport! That now on Pompey's Basis lies along, No worthier than the Dust. Cassi. So oft as that shall be, So often shall the Knot of us be call'd The Men that gave their Country Liberty. Deci. What, shall we forth? Cassi. Ay, ev'ry Man away— Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his Heels With the most boldest, and best Hearts of Rome. Enter Servant. Brut. Soft, who comes here? A Servant of Anthony's. Serv. Thus Brutus, did my Master bid me kneel, Thus did Mark Anthony bid me fall down, And being prostrate, thus he bad me say. Brutus is noble, wise valiant, and honest, Cæsar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving. Say I love Brutus, and I honour him, Say, I fear'd Cæsar, honour'd him, and lov'd him. If Brutus will vouchsafe, that Anthony May safely come to him, and be resolv'd, How Cæsar hath deserv'd to lye in Death, Mark Anthony shall not love Cæsar dead So well as Brutus living—But will follow The Fortunes and Affairs of noble Brutus, Thro' all the Hazards of this untrod State With all true Faith—So says my Master Anthony. Brut. Thy Master is a wise and valiant Roman, I never thought him worse. Tell him, so please him come unto this Place, He shall be satisfy'd; and by my Honour Depart untouch'd, Serv. I'll fetch him presently. [Exit. Brut. I know that we shall have him well to Friend. Cassi. I wish we may: But yet I have a Mind That fears him much; and my misgiving still Falls shrewdly to the Purpose— Enter Anthony. Brut. But here comes Anthony. Welcome Mark Anthony. Anth. O mighty Cæsar! Dost thou lye so low? Are all thy Conquests, Glories, Triumphs, Spoils, Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well! I know not Gentlemen what you intend! Who else must be let Blood? If I my self, there is no Hour so fit, As Cæsar's Death's Hour—nor no Instrument Of half that worth, as those your Swords made rich, With the most noble Blood of all this World. I do beseech you, if you bear me hard, Now, whilst your purpl'd Hands do reak and smoak, Fulfil your Pleasure; live a thousand Years, I shall not find my self so apt to die. No Place will please me so, no Mein of Death, As here by Cæsar, and by you cut off, The Choice and Master Spirits of the Age. Brut. O Anthony, beg not your Death of us: Tho' now we must appear bloody and cruel, As by our Hands, and this our present Act We seem to do—Yet see you but our Hands, Our Hearts you see not, they are pitiful. And pity to the general wrong of Rome, Hath done this Deed on Cæsar—For your part, To you, our Swords have Leaden Points, Mark Anthony, And our Hearts Of Brother's Temper, do receive you in With all kind Love, good Thoughts, and Reverence. Cassi. Your Voice shall be as strong as any Man's In the disposing of new Dignities. Brut. Only be patient, till we have appeas'd The Multitude, besides themselves will fear, And then we will deliver you the Cause, Why I, that did love Cæsar when I struck him, Have thus proceeded— Anth. I doubt not of your Wisdom; Let each Man render me his bloody Hand. First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you: Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your Hand, Now Decius Brutus, yours, now yours Mettellus: Yours Cinna, and my valiant Caska, yours. Tho' last, not least in Love, yours, good Trebonius Gentleman all—Alas! what shall I say? My Credit now stands on such slippery Ground, That one of two bad ways you must conceit me. Either a Coward or a Flatterer— That I did love thee once, Cæsar, 'tis true, If then thy Spirit look upon us now, Shall it not grieve thee, dearer than thy Death, To see thy Anthony making his Peace, Shaking the bloody Fingers of thy Foes— Had I as many Eyes as thou hast Wounds, Weeping as fast as they Stream forth thy Blood It wou'd become me better, than to close In Terms of Friendship with thy Enemies. Pardon me, Julius, here wast thou bay'd, brave Heart; Here didst thou fall, and here thy Hunters stand, Sign'd in thy Spoil, and crimson'd in thy Lethe. O World, thou wast the Forest to this Hart, And this indeed, O World, the Heat of thee. How, like a Deer, strucken by many Princes, Dost thou here lye. Cassi. Mark Anthony. Anth. Pardon me, Caius Cassius; The Enemies of Cæsar shall say this: Then, in a Friend, it is cold Modesty— Cassi. I blame you not for praising Cæsar so, But what Compact mean you to have with us? Will you be prick'd in Number of our Friends, Or shall we on, and not depend on you. Anth. Therefore I took your Hands, but was indeed Sway'd from the Point, by looking down on Cæsar: Friends am I with you all, and love you all, Upon this Hope, that you shall give me Reasons Why, and wherein, Cæsar was dangerous. Brut. Or else were this a savage Spectacle; Our Reasons are so full of good Regard, That were you, Anthony, the Son of Cæsar, You shou'd be satisfy'd. Anth. That's all I seek. And am moreover Suitor, that I may Produce his Body to the Market-place, And, in the Pulpit, as becomes a Friend, Speak in the Order of his Funeral.— Brut. You shall, Mark Anthony. Cassi. Brutus, a Word with you. You know not what you do; do not consent That Anthony speak in his Funeral, Know you how much the People may be mov'd By that which he will utter. Brut. By your pardon, I will my self into the Pulpit first, And shew the Reason of our Cæsar's Death— What Anthony shall I speak, I will protest He speaks by leave, and by permission; And that we are contented Cæsar shall Have all true Rites, and lawful Ceremonies: It shall advantage more, than do us wrong— Cassi. I know not what may fall, I like it not. Brut. Mark Anthony.—Here, take you Cæsar's Body; You shall not in your Funeral Speech blame us, But speak all good you can devise of Cæsar, And say you do't by our Permission— Else shall you not have any Hand at all About his Funeral: And you shall speak In the same Pulpit whereto I am going, After my Speech is ended. Anth. Be it so, I do desire no more. Brut. Prepare the Body then, and follow us. [Exit all but Anthony. Anth. O Pardon me, thou bleeding Piece of Earth, That I am meek and gentle with these Butchers. Thou art the Ruins of the noblest Man, That ever lived in the Tide of Times— Woe to the Hand, that shed this costly Blood. Over thy Wounds, now do I Prophecy, (Which like dumb Mouths, do ope their ruby Lips To beg the Voice and Utterance of my Tongue.) A Curse shall light upon the Limbs of Men, Domestick Fury, and fierce civil Strife, Shall cumber all the Parts of Italy! Blood and Destruction shall be so in use, And dreadful Objects so familiar, That Mothers shall but smile, when they behold Their Infants quarter'd with the Hands of War. That this foul Deed, shall Smell above the Earth. With Carrion Men, groaning for Burial— Enter Servant. You serve Octavius Cæsar, do you not? Serv. I do, Mark Anthony— Anth. Cæsar did write from him to come to Rome. Serv. He did receive his Letter, and is coming. And bid me say to you by Word of Mouth,— O Cæsar. Anth. Thy Heart is big—Get thee a part and weep, Passion I see is catching from mine Eyes, Seeing those Beads of Sorrow stand in thine; Began to Water—Is thy Master coming? Serv. He lies to Night within seven Leagues of Rome. Anth. Post back with speed, And tell him what hath chanc'd; Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No place of safety for Octavius yet, Hye hence, and tell him so.—Yet stay a while, Thou shalt not back, till I have born this Body To the Market-Place—There shall I try In my Oration, how the People take The cruel Issue of these bloody Men— Acccording to the which, thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the State of things. Take up the Body— [Exeunt. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and Mob. Mob. We will be satisfy'd, let us be satisfy'd. Brut. Then follow me, and give me Audience, Friends; Cassius, go you into the other Street, And part the Numbers— Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here, Those that will follow Cassius, go with him, And publick Reasons shall be rendred Of Cæsar's Death— 1. I will hear Brutus speak. 2. I will hear Cassius, and compare their Reasons, When severally we hear them rendred 3. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence. Brut. Romans, Countrymen, and Lovers, hear me for my Cause, and be silent, that you may hear—believe Me for mine Honour, and have respect to my Honour, That you may believe—Censure me in your Wisdom, and awake your Senses, that you may The better judge—If there be any in this Assembly, Any dear Friends of Cæsar's, to him I say, that Brutus love to Cæsar, was no less than his—If Then that Friend demand, why Brutus rose against Cæsar, this is my Answer—Not that I lov'd Cæsar less, but that I lov'd Rome more—Had you Rather Cæsar were living and dye Slaves, than That Cæsar were dead, to live all Freemen— As Cæsar lov'd me, I weep for him, as he Was fortunate, I rejoyce at it; as he was Valiant, I honour him—But as he was ambitious, I slew him—There is Tears, for his Love, Joy for his Fortune, Honour for his Valour, and Death for His Ambition—Who is here so base, that would Be a Bondman? If any speak—For him have I have offended—Who is here so rude, that would Not be a Roman? If any Speak—for him have I offended—Who is here so vile, that will not Love his Country? If any, Speak, for him Have I offended—I pause for a Reply— Omn. None, Brutus, none. Brut. Then none have I offended—I have done no More to Cæsar, than you shall do to Brutus. The Question of his Death, is Enroll'd in the Capitol—His Glory not extenuated, wherein He was worthy—Nor his Offences enforc'd, For which he suffer'd Death— Here comes his Body, mourn'd by Mark Anthony, who Tho' he had no Hand in his Death, shall receive The Benefit of his dying, a Place in the Common Wealth—As which if you shall not—with this I Depart, that as I slew my best Lover for the Good Of Rome, I have the same Dagger for my self, When it shall please my Country to need my Death. Omn. Live Brutus, live, live. 1. Bring him with Triumph home unto his House. 2. Give him a Statue with his Ancestors. 3. Let him be Cæsar. 4. Cæsar's better parts, Shall be crown'd in Brutus. 1. We'll bring him to his House, With Shouts and Clamours! Brut. My Countrymen! 2. Peace, Silence, Brutus speaks. 1. Peace, ho! Brut. Good Countrymen, let me depart alone, And, for my sake, stay here with Anthony. Do grace to Cæsar's Corps, and grace his Speech, Tending to Cæsar's Glories, which Mark Anthony By our Permission, is allow'd to make. I do entreat you not a Man depart, Save I alone, till Anthony have spoke. [Exit. Enter Anthony, with Cæsar's Body. 1. Stay ho, and let us hear Mark Anthony. 3. Let him go up into the publick Chair. We'll hear him—Noble Anthony go up. Anth. For Brutus sake, I am beholding to you: 4. What does he say of Brutus? 3. He says for Brutus sake, He is He finds himself beholding to us all. 4. 'Twere best he spake no harm of Brutus here. 1. This Cæsar was a Tyrant. 3. Nay, that's certain, We are blest that Rome is rid of him. 2. Peace let us hear what Anthony can say. Omn. Peace ho, let's hear him— Anth. Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your Ears, I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him. The Evil that Men do, lives after them, The Good is oft interred with their Bones. So let it be with Cæsar: The noble Brutus Hath told you, Cæsar was ambitious; If it were so, it was a grievous Fault. And grievously has Cæsar answer'd it: Here under leave of Brutus, and the rest, For Brutus is an honourable Man, (So are they all; all honourable Men) Come I to speak in Cæsar's Funeral. He was my Friend, faithful and just to me, But Brutus says, he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honourable Man— He hath brought many Captives home to Rome, Whose Ransom did the general Coffers fill. Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious? When that the Poor have cry'd, Cæsar hath wept, Ambition shou'd be made of sterner Stuff, Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And Brutus is an honourable Man— You all did see, that on the Lupercal, I thrice presented him a kingly Crown, Which he did thrice refuse—Was this Ambition? Yet Brutus says he was ambitious, And sure he is an honourable Man.— I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know, You all did love him once, not without Cause, What Cause with-holds you then, to mourn for him? O Judgment! Thou art fled to brutish Beasts, And Men have lost their Reasons—Bear with me, My Heart is in the Coffin there with Cæsar, And I must pause, till it come back to me— 1. Methinks there is much Reason in his Sayings. 2. If thou consider rightly of the Matter, Cæsar has had great Wrong. 3. Has he Master's! I fear there will a Worse come in his place. 4. Mark'd you his Words? he wou'd not take the Crown, Therefore 'tis certain, he was not ambigious. 1. If it be found, some will dear abide it 2. Poor Soul, his Eyes are red as Fire with weeping. 3. There's not a nobler Man in Rome than Anthony. 4. Now mark him, he begins agen to speak. Anth. But Yesterday, the Word of Cæsar might Have stood against the World—Now lies he there And none so proper to do him Reverence. O Masters! If I were dispos'd to stir Your Hearts and Minds to Mutiny and Rage, I should do Brutus Wrong, and Cassius Wrong, Who you all know, are hononurable Men, I will not do them Wrong: I rather chuse To wrong the Dead, to wrong my self, and you, Than I will wrong such honourable Men— But here's a Parchment with the Seal of Cæsar, I found it in his Closet—'Tis his Will— Let but the Commons hear this Testament, Which, Pardon me, I do not mean to read, And they would go and kiss dead Cæsar's Wounds, And dip their Napkins in his sacred Blood; Yea, beg a Hair of him for Memory, And dying, mention it within their Wills, Bequeathing it as a rich Legacy Unto their Issue. 4. We'll hear the Will—read it, Mark Anthony. Omn. The Will, the Will—We will hear Cæsar's Will. Anth. Have Patience, gentle Friends, I must not read it. It is not meet, you know how Cæsar lov'd you. You are not Wood, you are not Stones, but Men, And being Men, hearing the Will of Cæsar, It will enflame you, it will make you mad; 'Tis good you know not that you are his Heirs, For if you shou'd, O what will come of it? 4. Read the Will, we'll hear it, Anthony, You shall read us the Will; Cæsar's Will. Anth. Will you be patient? Will you stay a while. I have o'reshot my self to tell you of it, I fear I wrong the honourable Men, Whose Daggers have stabb'd Cæsar—I do fear it. 4. They were Traytors—Honourable Men! 2. They were Villains, Murderers—The Will, read the Will. Anth. You will compel me then to read the Will— Then make a Ring about the Corps of Cæsar, And let me shew you him that made the Will. Shall I descend—And will you give me Leave? Omn. Come down. 2. Descend. 3. You shall have Leave. 4. A Ring, Stand round. 1. Stand from the Hearse—Stand from the Body. 2. Room for Anthony, Most noble Anthony. Anth. Nay, press not so upon me—Stand far off. Omn. Stand back—Room, bear back. Anth. If you have Tears, prepare to shed 'em now, You all do know this Mantle—I remember The first time Cæsar ever put it on, 'Twas on a Summer's Evening, in his Tent, That Day he overcame the Nervii. Look, in this place run Cassius Dagger thro' See what a Rent the envious Caska made. Thro' this, the Well-beloved Brutus Stabb'd, And as he pluck'd his cursed Steel away, Mark how the Blood of Cæsar follow'd it. As rushing out of Doors, to be resolv'd If Brutus so unkindly knock'd or no: For Brutus, as you know, was Cæsars Angel. Judge, O ye Gods! how dearly Cæsar lov'd him. This was the most unkindest Cut of all, For when the noble Cæsar saw him Stab, Ingratitude, more strong than Traytors Arms, Quite Vanquish'd him: Then burst his mighty Heart, And in his Mantle, muffling up his Face, Ev'n at the Base of Pompey's Statute (Which all the while ran Blood) Great Cæsar fell. O what a fall was there, my Countrymen? Then I, and you, and all of us fell down, Whilst bloody Treason flourish'd over us. O! now you weep, and I perceive you feel The dint of pity—These are gracious Drops. Kind Souls! What weep you, when you but behold Our Cæsar's Vesture wounded? Look you here, Here is himself, marr'd as you see with Traytors. 1. O piteous Spectacle! 2. O noble Cæsar! 3. O woful Day! 4. O Traytors! Villains! 1. O most bloody Sight! 2. We will be Reveng'd: Revenge, About, Seek, Burn, Fire, Kill, Slay, Let not a Traytor Live. Ant. Stay Countrymen! 1. Peace there—Hear the noble Anthony. 2. We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll dye with him. Ant. Good Friends, sweet Friends, let me not stir you up To such a sudden Flood of Mutiny. They that have done this Deed, are honourable. What private Griefs they have, alass I know not, That made 'em do it—They are wise &amp; honourable And will, no doubt, with Reasons Answer you. I come not Friends, to steal away your Hearts, I am no Orator, as Brutus is, But as you know me all, a plain blunt Man. That love my Friend, and that they know full well. That gave me publick leave to speak of him. But I have neither Wit, nor Words, nor Worth, Action, nor utterance, nor the power of Speech, To stir Mens Bloods—I only speak right on, I tell you that, which you your selves do know, Shew you sweet Cæsars Wounds, poor, poor, dumb Mouths— And bid them speak for me—But were I Brutus, And Brutus Anthony, there were an Anthony Wou'd ruffle up your Spirits, and put a Tongue In ev'ry Wound of Cæsar—That shou'd mov'd The Stones of Rome to rise and Mutiny. All. We'll Mutiny. 1. Well Burn the House of Brutus. 3. Away then, come, seek the Conspirators. Ant. Yet hear me Countrymen, yet hear me speak All. Peace ho, hear Anthony most noble Anthony. Ant. Why Friends: you go to do I know not what Wherein hath Cæsar thus deserv'd your Loves? Alass you know not, I must tell you then: You have forgot the Will I told you off. All. Most true, the Will—let's stay and hear the Will. Ant. Here is the Will, and under Cæsar's Seal. To ev'ry Roman Citizen he gives, To ev'ry several Man, seventy five Drachma's. 2. Most noble Cæsar—We'll revenge his Death 3. O Royal Cæsar! Ant. Hear me with Patience. All. Peace ho. Ant. Moreover he hath left you all his Walks, His private Arbors, and new planted Orchards. On this side Tyber, he hath left them you, And to your Heirs for ever—Common Pleasures To walk abroad, and recreate your selves. Here was a Cæsar—When comes such another. 4. Never, never, come, away, away, We'll burn his Body in the holy Place, And with the brands fire the Traytor's Houses. Take up the Body. Huzza. [Exeunt. Ant. Now let it work, mischief, thou art a'foot Take thou what Course thou wilt. Enter Servant. How now Fellow. Serv. Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome. Ant. Where is he? Serv. He and Lepidus are at Cæsars House. Ant. And thither will I straight to Visit him. He comes upon a Wish—Fortune is Merry, And in this Mood will give us any thing. Serv. I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius, Are rid like Madmen, thro' the Gates of Rome. Ant. Belike they had some notice of the People How I had mov'd 'em—bring me to Octavius. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Anthony, Octavius, Lepidus discover'd. Anth. These many then shall dye—their Names are prick'd. Octa. Your Brother too must dye—Consent you Lepidus? Lep. I do Consent. Octa. Prick him down Anthony. Lep. Upon Condition, Publius shall not Live, Who is your Sisters Son, Mark Anthony. Ant. He shall not Live—Look with a Spot I damn him. But Lepidus, go you to Cæsars house, Fetch the Will hither, and we shall determine How to Cut off some Charge in Legacies. Lep. What, Shall I find you here? [Exit. Octa. Or Here, or at the Capitol. Ant. This is a slight unmeritable Man, Meet to be sent on Errands—Is it fit, The threefold World divided, he shou'd stand One of the three to share it. Octa. So you thought him, And took his Voice, who shou'd be prick'd to dye, In our black Sentence, and Proscription. Ant. Octavius, I have seen more Days then you And tho' we lay these Honours on this Man To ease our selves of diverse slanderous Loads, He shall but bear them, as the Ass bears Gold, To Groan and Sweat under the Business, Either led or driven, as we point the way. And having brought our Treasure where we will, Then take we down his Load, and turn him off. (Like to the empty Ass) to shake his Ears, And graze in Commons. Octa. You may do your Will, But he's a try'd, and valiant Soldier. Ant. So is my Horse, Octavius, and for that, I do appoint him store of Provender. It is a Creature that I teach to Fight, To wind, to Stop, to run directly on: His Corporal motion, govern'd by my Spirit, And in some taste, is Lepidus but so: Do not talk of him, But as a Property; and now Octavius, Listen great Things—Brutus and Cassius Are levying Powers: We must straight make Head, Therefore let our Alliance be combin'd, Our best Friends made, our Means stretch'd, And let us presently go sit in Council, How covert Matters may be best disclos'd, And open Perils surest answer'd. Octa. Let us do so—for we are at the Stake, And bayed about with many Enemies— And some that smile, have in their Hearts, I fear, Million of Mischiefs—March here. [Exeunt. Enter Brutus, Lucilius, and Soldiers, meeting Caska, and Pindarus. Brut. Stand, ho! Luc. Give the Word ho, and stand! Brut. What now Lucilius, is Cassius near? Luc. He is at Hand, and Pindarus is come, To do you Salutation from his Master. Brut. He greets me well—Your Master Pindarus In his own Change, or by ill Officers, Hath giv'n me some worthy Cause to wish Things done, undone,—but if he be at hand, I shall be satisfy'd. Pin. I do not doubt, But that my noble Master will appear Such as he is, full of Regard, and Honour. Brut. He is not doubted—a Word, Lucilius, How he receiv'd you, let me be resolv'd. Luc. With Courtesy—and with Respect enough, But not with such familiar Instances, Nor with such free, and friendly Conference, As he hath us'd of old— Brut. Thou hast describ'd A hot Friend, cooling: Ever note Lucilius, When Love begins to sicken and decay, Is useth an enforced Ceremony There are no Tricks in plain and simple Faith, But hollow Men, like Horses hot at hand, Make gallant Shew, and Promise of their Mettle. But when they shou'd endure the bloody Spur, They fall their Crests, and like deceitful Jades, Sink in the Tryal—Comes his Army on? Luc. They mean this Night in Sardis to be quarter'd: The greater Part, the Horse, in general, Are come with Cassius. [March here. Enter Cassius, and Soldiers. Brut. Hark, he is arriv'd. March gently on to meet him. Cassi. Stand, ho! Brut. Stand, ho. Speak the Word along— Stand. Stand. Stand. Cassi. Most noble Brother, you have done me Wrong. Brut. Judge me, ye Gods; wrong I mine Enemies? And if not so, how shou'd I wrong a Brother. Cassi. Brutus, this sober Form of your hides Wrongs, And when you do them— Brut. Cassius, be content. Speak your Griefs softly, I do know you well. Before the Eyes of both our Armies here (Which shou'd perceive nothing but Love from us) Let us not Wrangle—bid them move away, Then in my Tent Cassius, enlarge your Griefs, And I will give you audience— Cassi. Pindarus, Bid our Commanders lead their Charges off A little from this Ground. Brut. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no Man Come to our Tent, till we have done our Conference. Let Lucius, and Titinius guard our Door. [Exeunt. Re-enter Brutus, and Cassius. Cassi. That you have wrong'd me, doth appear in this. You have condemn'd, and noted Lucius Pella, For taking Bribes here of the Sardians; Wherein my Letters, praying on his side, Because I knew the Man, was slighted of. Brut. You wrong'd your self, to write in such a Case. Cassi. In such a time as this, it it not meet That ev'ry nice Offence shou'd bear his Comment. Brut. Let me tell you Cassius, you your self Are much condemn'd to have an itching Palm, To sell and mart your Offices for Gold, To Undeservers. Cassi. I an itching Palm? You know that you are Brutus that speaks this, Or by the Gods, this Speech were else your last. Brut. This Name of Cassius Honours this Corruption And Chastisement doth therefore hide his Head. Cassi. Chastisement! Brut. Remember March, the Ides of March remember, Did not great Julius bleed for Justice sake. What Villain touch'd his Body, that did stab, And not for Justice—What, shall one of us, That struck the foremost Man of all this World, But for supporting Robbers—Shall we now, Contaminate our Fingers with base Bribes? And sell the mighty Space of our large Honours, For so much Trash, as may be grasped thus? I had rather be a Dog, and bay the Moon, Than such a Roman— Cassi. Brutus, bait not me, I'll not endure it. I am a Soldier, I, Older in practice, abler than your self, To make Conditions. Brut. Go to, You are not Cassius. Cassi. I am. Brut. Away, slight Man. Cassi. Is't Possible? Brut. Hear me, for I will speak. Must I give way and room to your rash Choler, Shall I be frighted when a Madman Stares? Cassi. O ye Gods, ye Gods, must I endure all this? Brut. All this? Ay, more: fret till your proud heart break: Go, shew your Slaves how Cholerick you are, And make your Bondmen tremble: must I bow? Must I observe you: must I stand and Crouch Under your testy Humour? by the Gods You shall digest the Venom of your Spleen, Tho' it do split you—for, from this day forth, I'll use you for my mirth, yea for my Laughter, When you are waspish— Cassi. Is it Come to this? Brut. You say, you are a better Soldier; Let it appear so: Make your Vaunting true, And it shall please me well—for mine own part; I shall be glad to learn of noble Men— Cassi. You wrong me ev'ry way You wrong me Brutus— I said an Elder Soldier, not better. Did I say better? Brut. If you did I care not. Cassi. When Cæsar liv'd, he durst not thus have mov'd me Brut. Peace, peace, you durst not so have tempted him. Cassi. I durst not? Brut. No, I durst not! Cassi. What, durst not tempt him? Brut. For your Life you durst not. Cassi. Do not presume two much upon my Love; I may do that I shall be sorry for. Brut. You have done that you shou'd be sorry for. There is no terror Cassius, in your threats For I am Arm'd so strong in honesty, That they pass by me as the idle Wind; Which I respect not—I did send to you For certain Sums of Gold, For I can raise no Money by vile means; By Heav'n I had rather Coin my heart; And drop my Blood for Drachma's, than to wring From the hard hand of Peasants there vile trash By any indirection—I did send To you for Gold to pay my Legions, Which you deny'd me—was that done like Cassius? Shou'd I have answer'd Caius Cassius so? When Marcus Brutus grows so Covetous, To lock such Rascal Counters from his Friends, Be ready Gods, with all your Thunderbolts, Dash him to pieces. Cassi. I deny'd you not. Brut. You did. Cassi. I did not. He was but a fool That brought my Answer back: Brutus hath riv'd my Heart. A Friend shou'd bear his Friends Infirmities. But Brutus makes mine greater than they are. Brut. I do not, 'till you practice them on me. Cassi. You Love me not. Brut. I do not like your faults. Cassi. A Friendly Eye cou'd never see such faults Brut. A Flatterer's wou'd not, tho' they do appear As huge as high Olympus. Cassi. Come Anthony, and young Octavius come, Revenge your selves alone on Cassius, For Cassius is a weary of the World. Hated by one he Loves, brav'd by his Brother; Check'd like a Bondman, all his Faults observ'd, Set in a Note Book, Learn'd, and Conn'd by Roat, To cast into my Teeth—O! I cou'd Weep My Spirit from my Eyes—There is my Dagger, And here my naked Breast—Within a Heart Dearer than Pluto's mine, Richer than Gold. If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth, I that deny'd thee Gold, will give my Heart; Strike as thou didst at Cæsar, for I know When thou did'st hate him worst, thou lovd'st him Better, Than ever thou lovd'st Cassius. Brut. Sheath your Dagger, Be angry when you will, Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour. O Cassius, you are Yoked with a Lamb, That carries Anger, as a Flint bears Fire Who much Enforced, shews a hasty Spark, And straight is Cold agen. Cassi. Hath Cassius Liv'd To be but Mirth and Laughter to his Brutus, When Grief, and Blood ill temper'd, vexeth him. Brut. When I spoke that, I was ill temper'd too: Cassi. Do you confess so much—Give me your hand Brut. And my heart too: Cassi. O Brutus, Brutus. Brut. What's the matter? Cassi. Have not you Love enough to bear with me, When that rash humour which my Mother gave me; Makes me forgetful. Brut. Yes, Cassius, and henceforth, When you are over earnest with your Brutus, He'll think your Mother chides, and leave you so: Bid the Commanders Lucius Prepare to Lodge their Companies to night— Cassi. And bring Messala with you, Immediately to us. Brut. Lucilius, a Bowl of Wine. Cassi. I did not think you cou'd have been so Angry. Brut. O Cassius, I am sick of many Griefs, Cassi. Of your Philosophy you make no use; If you give place to accidental evils. Brut. No Man bears sorrow better—Portia is dead. Cassi. Ha Portia! Brut. She is dead. Cassi. How scap'd I killing, when I Crost you so? Upon what Sickness. Brut. Impatient of my absence, And grief, that young Octavius, with Mark Anthony Have made themselves so strong: for with her death. That tydings came—with this she fell distracted, And (her attendants absent) swallow'd fire. Cassi. And dy'd so: Brut. Ev'n so: Cassi. O ye Immortal Gods! Enter Boy with Wine. Brut. Speak no more of her: Give me a Bowl of Wine. In this I buy all unkindness, Cassius. Cassi. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge. Fill Lucius, till the wine o'reswel the Cup. I cannot drink too much of Brutus Love. Enter Messala and Caska. Brut. Come in Caska. Welcome, Good Messala. Now sit we down And call in Question our necessities. Cassi. Portia, Art thou gone? Brut. No more, I pray you. Messala, I have here receiv'd Letters, That young Octavius, and Mark Anthony Come down upon us with a mighty Power Bending their Expedition toward Philippi. Mess. My self have Letters of the self same Tenure. Brut. With what Addition? Mess. That by Proscription, and bills of outlawry, Octavius, Anthony, and Lepidus Have put to death an hundred Senators. Brut. Therein our Letters do not well agree, Mine speak of seventy Senators that dy'd, By their Proscriptions—Cicero being one. Cass. Cicero one! Mess. Cicero is dead, and by that order of Proscription. Had you your Letters from your Wife, my Lord? Brut. No Messala. Mess. Nor nothing in your Letters writ of her. Brut. Nothing Messala. Mess. That methinks is strange. Brut. Why ask you? Hear you ought of her in yours? Mess. No, my Lord. Brut. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true. Mess. Then like a Roman, bear the truth I tell. For certain she is dead, and by strange manner Brut. Why farewel Portia—we must die; Messala, With meditating that she must die once I have the Patience to endure it now. Mess. Ev'n so great Men great losses shou'd endure. Cass. I have as much of this in art, as you. But yet my Nature cou'd not bear it so: Brut. Well to our Work alive—what do you think Of marching to Philippi presently. Cass. I do not think it Good. Brut. Your Reason? Cass. This it is. 'Tis better that the Enemy seeks us So shall he waste his means, weary his Soldiers, Doing himself offence—whilst we lying still, Are full of rest, defence, and nimbleness. Brut. Good reasons must, of force, give way to better, The People, 'twixt Philippi and this Ground, Do stand but in a forc'd affection— For they have grudg'd us Contributio— The Enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number up, Come on refresh'd, new added, and encourag'd. From which advantage shall we cut him off; If at Philippi we do face him there; These People at our back. Cass. Hear me, good Brother. Brut. Under your pardon, you must note beside That we have try'd the utmost of our Friends; Our Legions are brim full, our Cause is ripe, The Enemy encreaseth ev'ry day, We at the height, are ready to decline. There is a tyde in the affairs of Men, Which, taken at the flood, leads on to Fortune; Omitted, all the Voyage of their Life Is bound in Shallows, and in miseries. On such a full Sea are we now afloat, And we must take the current when it serves, Or lose our ventures. Cass. Then with your will go on—we'l along Our selves, and meet them at Philippi. Brut. The deep of night is crept upon our talk, And Nature must obey necessity— There is no more to say. Cass. No more—Good night; Early to morrow will we rise—and hence. Brut. Farewel, Good Messala, Good night Caska—noble, noble, Cassius, Good night, and good repose. Cass. O my dear Brother! This was an ill beginning of the night: Never come such Division 'tween our Souls. Let it not Brutus. Brut. Ev'ry thing is well— Cass. Good night, my Lord. Brut. Good night good brother. Mess. Good night, Lord Brutus. [Exeunt. Brut. Farewel ev'ry one. Where is thy Instrument? Luc. Here in the tent Brut. What, thou speak'st drowsily; Poor knave, I blame thee not—thou art o'erwatch'd. Call Claudio, and some other of my Men, I'll have them sleep on Cushions in my tent. Luc. Varrus, and Claudio. Enter Varrus and Claudio. Var. My Lord! Brut. I pray you sirs, lie in my tent and sleep, It may be I shall raise you by and by On business to my Brother Cassius— Var. So please you, we will stand, And watch your pleasure— Brut. I will not have it so—Lie down, good sirs, It may be I shall otherwise bethink me. Lucius, Can'st thou hold up thy heavy eyes a while, And touch thy Instrument a strain or two. Luc. I my Lord, an't please you. Brut. It does my Boy. I trouble thee too much—but thou art willing. Luc. It is my duty Sir. Brut. I should not urge thy duty past thy might. I know young bloods look for a time of rest— Luc. I have slept my Lord, already. Brut. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep agen, I will not hold thee long, if I do live, I will be good to thee— [Musick here behind. Brut. This is a sleepy tune—O Murderous Slumber! Lay'st thou thy leaden Mace upon my Boy, That plays thee Musick—gentle knave, Good night, I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee, If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy Instrument, I'll take it from thee, and good boy, Good night [Ghost of Cæsar Rises. Let me see, let me see—is not the leaf turn'd down Where I left reading? here it is, I think. How ill this taper burns! ha, who comes here! I think it is the weakness of my eyes, That shapes this Monstrous Apparition? It comes upon me—art thou any thing? Art thou some God, some Angel, or some Devil, That mak'st my blood cold, and my hair to Stair? Speak to me, what thou art. Ghost. Thy evil Spirit Brutus. Brut. Why com'st thou? Ghost. To tell thee, thou shalt see me at Philippi. Brut. Well, then I shall see thee agen Ghost. I, at Philippi. Brut. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then— [Ring down Now I have taken heart, thou Vanishest, Ill Spirit, I wou'd hold more talk with thee. Boy, Lucius, Varrus, Claudio, Sirs awake. Claudio. Luc. The Strings, my Lord, are false— Brut. He thinks he still is at his Instrument. Lucius awake. Luc. My Lord. Brut. Did'st thou dream Lucius, that thou so cryd'st out? Luc. My Lord, I do not know that I did cry. Brut. Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing? Luc. Nothing my Lord. Brut. Lucius—Sirrah, Claudio, fellow. Thou awake— Var. My Lord. Clad. My Lord. Brut. Why did you so cry out sirs in your sleep? Both. Did we, my Lord? Brut. I—saw you any thing. Vac. No my Lord, I saw nothing. Claud. Nor I my Lord. Brut. Go and Commend me to my brother Cassius, Bid him set on his powers, betimes before, And we will follow. Both. It shall be done, my Lord— [Exeunt. Brut. Sure they have raised some Devil to their aid, And think to frighten Brutus with a shade. But e're the night closes this fatal Day, I'll send more Ghosts this visit to repay— [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. Enter Anthony, Octavius, and Soldiers. [A March begin. Act. Now Anthony, our hopes are answer'd; You said the enemy wou'd not come down, But keep the hills, and upper regions, It proves not so—their battles are at hand, They mean to warn us at Philippi here, Answering before we do demand of them. Anth. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know Wherefore they do it; they cou'd be content To visit other places, and come down With fearful bravery—thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts, that they have Courage. But 'tis not so— Enter Messenger. Mess. Prepare you Generals, The Enemy comes on in Gallant shew, Their bloody sign of battle is hung out, And something to be done, immediately. Anth. Octavius, lead your battle softly on, Upon the left hand of the ev'n field. Oct. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left Anth. Why do you cross me in this Exigent? Oct. I do not cross you—but I will do so [March here. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and Soldiers Caska. Brut. They stand, and wou'd have parley. Cass. Stand fast, good Caska we must out and talk. Brut. Words before blows—Is it so Countrymen? Oct. Not that we love words better, as you do. Brut. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius. Anth. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give Good Words, Witness the hole you made in Cæsars heart, Crying, long live, hail Cæsar. Cass. Anthony, The posture of your blows are yet unknown, But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees, And leave them honeyless. Anth. Not Stingless too. Brut. O yes, and soundless too. For you have stolen their buzzing Anthony, And very wisely threat before they Sting. Anth. Villains you did not so, when your vile Daggers Hack't one another in the sides of Cæsar, You shew'd your Teeth like Apes, And fawn'd like Hounds, And bow'd like Bondmen, kissing Cæsars feet, Whilst damned Caska, like a cur behind Struck Cæsar on the neck—O you flatterers Cass. Flatterers! now Brutus, thank your self, This Tongue had not offended so to day, If Cassius might have rul'd. Oct. Come, come, the Cause—if arguing makes us sweat, The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look I draw a Sword against Conspirators, When think you that this Sword goes up agen? Never 'till Cæsars three and thirty wounds Be all aveng'd: or 'till another Cæsar Have added Slaughter to the Sword of Traytors Brut. Cæsar, thou canst not die by Traytors hands, Unless thou bring'st them with thee. Oct. So I hope. I was not born to die on Brutus Sword. Brut. Oh if thou wer't the noblest of the strain, Young Man, thou coud'st not die more Honourable. Cass. A peevish School-boy, worthless of such Honour, Joyned with a Maker, and a Reveller. Ant. Old Cassius still. Oct. Come, Anthony away: Defience Traytor, hurl we in your teeth, If you dare fight to day, come to the field, If not, when you have Stomachs— [Exeunt. Cass. Why now, blow wind, swell billow, And Swim bark, The Storm is up, and all is on the hazard. Brut. Ho, Lucilius— [Lucilius and Massala stand forth. Hark a word with you. Luc. My Lord. [Cassi.] Messala. Mess. What says my General? Cassi. Messala, This is my birth-day: as this very day Was Cassius born—Give me thy hand, Messala. Be thou my witness, that against my will (As Pompey was) am I compelled to set Upon one battle all our Liberties You know that I held Epicurus strong, And his opinion—now I change my mind, And partly Credit things that do presage. Coming from Sardis, on our formost Ensign Two mighty Eagles fell, and there they perch'd, Gorging and feeding from our Soldiers hands, Who to Philippi, here Consorted us: This Morning are they fled away, and gone, And, in their steads, do Ravens, Crows, and Kites Fly o're our heads, and downward look on us, As we were sickly prey—their shadows seem A Canopy most fatal, under which. Our Army lies, ready to give up the Ghost. Mess. Believe not so— Cass. I but believe it partly, For I am fresh of Spirit, and resolv'd To meet all perils very Constantly— Brut. Ev'n so Lucilius. Cassi. Now most noble Brutus, The Gods to day stand friendly, that we may, Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age. But since the affairs of Men rest still uncertain, Let's reason with the worst that may befal. If we do lose this battle, then is this The very last time we shall speak together What are you then determined to do. Brut. Ev'n by the rule of that Philosophy, By which I did blame Cato, for the Death, Which he did give himself, I know not how: But I do find it Cowardly and Vile, For fear of what might fall, so to prevent The time of Life, arming my self with Patience, To stay the Providence of some high Powers, That Govern us below: Cass. Then if we lose this Battle. You are Contented to be led in Triumph Thorow the streets of Rome— Brut. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman, That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome. He bears too great a mind: But this same day Must end that work, the Ideas of March begun. And whether we shall meet agen. I know not. Therefore our Everlasting farewel take, For ever, and forever, farewel, Cassius, If we do meet agen, why, we shall smile, If not, why then, this parting was well made— Cass. For ever, and forever, farewel Brutus, If we do meet agen, we'll smile indeed. If not, 'tis true, this parting was well made. Brut. Why then lead on—Oh, that a Man might know The end of this Days business e're it Come. But it sufficeth, that the day will end, And then the end is known—Come ho away [An Alarm. Exeunt. Re-enter Brutus, and Messala. Brut. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give These Bills Unto the Legions on the other side— Let them set on at once—for I perceive But cold demeaner in Octaviu's wing— And sudden push gives them the overthrow. Ride, Ride, Messala, let them all come down. [Alarm Exit. Enter Cassius, and Caska. Cass. O look Caska, look, the Villains fly, My self have to mine own turn'd Enemy. This Ensign here of mine was turning back, I slew the Coward, and did take it from him. Cask. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word two early, Who having some advantage on Octavius Took it too eagerly, his Soldiers fell to spoil, Whilst we by Anthony are all enclos'd. Enter Pindarus. Pin. Fly further off, my Lord, fly further off, Mark Anthony is in your tents, my Lord. Fly therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off. Cassi. This hill is far enough—Look, look, Caska, Are those my tents where I perceive the fire? Caska. They are my Lord. Cass. If thou Lov'st me, Mount thou my horse, and hide thy Spurs in him, 'Till he have brought thee up to yonder hill— And here agen, that I may rest assur'd, Whether yond Troops are friend or enemy Caska. I will be here agen ev'n with a thought [Exit. Cass. Go Pindarus, get higher on that hill, My sight was ever thick: regard Caska, And tell me what thou not'st about the field. This day I breathed first, time is come round, And where I did begin, there shall I end, My Life is run his Compass—Sirrah, what news: Pin. O my Lord! Cass. What news ! Pin. Caska is enclosed round about With Horsemen, that make to him on the Spur. Yet he Spurs on—now they are almost on him. Now some Light—O, he lights too. He's ta'n [Shout here. And hark, they shout for Joy. Cass. Come down, behold no more. O Coward that I am, to live so long, To see my best friend ta'ne before my face. Come hither sirrah: In Parthia, did I take thee Prisoner, And then I swore thee, saving of thy Life, that whatsoever, I did bid thee do, Thou shoud'st attempt it. Come now keep thine Oath, Now be a freeman, and with this Good Sword, That ran thro' Cæsars bowels, search this bosom. Stand not to answer—here, take thou the hilts, And when my face is cover'd as 'tis now, Guide thou the Sword—Cæsar thou art revenged, Even with the Sword that kill'd thee. Pin. So I am free, [falls on the Sword. Yet wou'd not so have been, Durst I have done my will—O Cassius, Far from this Country Pindarus shall go, Where never Roman shall behold him more. [Exit. Enter Caska and Messala. Mess. It is but change Good Caska, for Octavius Is overthrown by noble Brutus power, As Cassius Legions are by Anthony. Cass. These tydings will well comfort Cassius. Mess. Where did you leave him? Cask. All disconsolate With Pindarus his bondman on this hill. Mess. Is not that he that lies upon the Ground? Cask. He lies not like the living—Oh my heart! Messi. Is not that he? Cask. No, this was he, Messala, But Cassius is no more—Oh setting Sun! As in thy red Rays thou durst sink to night, So in his red Blood, Cassius day is set. The Sun of Rome is set—our day is gone, Clouds, dews, and dangers come, our deeds are done. Mistrust of my success hath done this deed Mess. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed. Oh hateful Error! Melancholys Child! Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of Men The things that are not? Oh Error soon Conceiv'd! Thou never com'st unto a happy Birth, But kill'st the Mother, that engender'd thee. Cask. What Pindarus! Where art thou Pindarus? Mess. Seek him, Good Caska, whilst I go to meet The noble Brutus thrusting this report Into his Ear—I may say, thrusting it. For piercing Steel, and darts in venom dipt Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus, As tydings of this sight— [Exit. Cask. Haste good Messala— And I will seek for Pindarus the while— Why didst thou send me forth brave Cassius? Did I not meet thy friends, and did not they Put on my brow, this wreath of Victory, And bid me give it thee—didst thou not hear. Their shouts? Alass, thou hast misconstru'd ev'ry thing. But hold thee, take this Garland on thy brow, Thy Brutus bid me give it thee and I Will do his bidding—Brutus come apace, And see how I regarded Caius Cassius! By your leave Gods, this is a Roman's part, Come Cassius Sword, and find out Caska's Heart. [Aloud Alarm. Kills himself. Enter Brutus, Messala, Dardanius, Popilius, and Lucilius. Brut. Where, where Messala, doth the Body Lie? Mess. Lo, yonder, and brave Caska mourning it. Brut. His face is upwards. Luc. Alas he's slain. [A low alarm here. Brut. Are yet two Romans, living such as these? The last of all the Romans, fare thee well! It is impossible that ever Rome, Shou'd breed thy like—friends, I owe more tears To this dead Man, than you shall see me pay. I shall find time Cassius, I shall find time! Come therefore, and to Tarsus send his body, His Funeral shall not be in our Camp, Lest it discomfort us—Leave us a while. [Exit. O Julius Cæsar, thou art mighty yet, And turn'st our Swords into our proper Entrails. Enter Cæsars Ghost— Ghost. Cassius, my three and thirty wounds are now reveng'd. Brut. What art thou, why com'st thou. Ghost. To keep my word, and meet thee in Philippi fields. Brut. Well, I see thee then. Ghost. Next, ungrateful Brutus, do I call. Brut. Ungrateful Cæsar, that wou'd Rome Enthral Ghost. The Ides of March Remember—I must go, To meet thee on the burning Lake below [Sinks. Brut. My Spirits come to me—Stay thou bloody Apparition, come back, I wou'd converse Longer with thee—'tis gone, this fatal shadow Haunts me still. Brut. Come, let's to the field—Flavius, set our Battles on—and Romans, yet e're night, We shall try fortune in a second fight. Take off Cassius. [Alarm here. Exeunt. Enter Anthony, meeting Soldiers, and Messala, Prisoner. Sold. Here comes the General. Brutus is ta'ne, Brutus is ta'ne my Lord. Anth. Where is he. Mess. Safe Anthony—Brutus is safe enough— I dare assure thee that no Enemy Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus. The Gods defend him from so great a shame. When you do find him or alive or dead He will be found like Brutus, like himself. Anth. This is not Brutus, but I assure you, A prize no less in worth—keep this Man safe, Give him all kindness—I had rather have Such Men my friends, than Enemies—go on, And see where Brutus be alive or dead. And bring us word unto Octavius's tent How every thing is Chanc'd. [Exeunt. Enter Brutus, Dardanius, Lucilius, and Popilius. Brut. Come, poor remains of friends, let us rest here. Luc. Statilius shew'd the torch light, but my Lord He came not back—he is or ta'ne, or slain Brut. Come hither Lucilius, slaying is the Word, It is a deed in fashion—hark thee Lucilius. Luc. What I, my Lord, no not for all the World. Brut. Peace then, no Words. Luc. I'll rather kill my self. Brut. Hark thee, Dardanius. Dar. Shall I do such a deed? Luc. What ill request did Brutus make to thee. Dar. To kill him, Lucilius—look he meditates. Brut. Come hither, Good Popilius, list a word. Pop. What says my Lord. Brut. Why this, Popilius. The Ghost of Cæsar has appear'd to me Two several times by night—at Sardis once, And this same night in here in Philippi fields! I know my hour is come. Pop. Not so, my Lord. Brut. Nay, I am sure it is Popilius. Thou see'st the World Popilius, how it goes, Our Enemies have beat us to the Pit, It is more worthy to leap in our selves, Then tarry till they push us—Good Popilius Thou know'st that we two went to School together Ev'n for that our Love of old, I prithee Hold thou my Sword, while I run on it.
