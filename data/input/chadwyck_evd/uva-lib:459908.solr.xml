      <field name="fulltext">Non ego VentosÃ¦ Plebis suffragia venor. Horat.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right HONORABLE, HENRY HOWARD, OF NORFOLK.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The First SCENE is The City of SEVIL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue Enters with a Play-Bill in his hand, and Reads, This Day being the 15 t h of December, shall be Acted a New Play, never Plai'd before, call'd The Adventures of Five Hours. A NEW PLAY. Th'are t'the right, for I dare boldly say, The English Stage ne'r had so New a Play; The Dress, the Author, and the Scenes are New. This ye have seen before ye'l say; 'tis true; But tell me, Gentlemen, who ever saw A deep Intrigue confin'd to Five Hours Law. Such as for close Contrivance yields to none: A Modest Man may praise what's not his own. 'Tis true, the Dress is his, which he submits To those who are, and those who would be Wits; Ne'r spare him Gentlemen, for to speak truth, He has a per'lous Cens'rer been in's Youth; And now grown Bald with Age, Doating on Praise, He thinks to get a Periwig of Bays. Teach him what 'tis, in this Discerning Age To bring his heavy Genius on the Stage; Where you have seen such Nimble Wits appear, That pass'd so soon, one scarce could say th'were here. Yet after our Discoveries of late Of their Designs, who would Subvert the State; You'l wonder much, if it should prove his Lot, To take all England with a Spanish Plot; But if through his ill Conduct, or hard Fate, This Forein Plot (like that of Eighty Eight) Should suffer Shipwrack in your Narrow Seas, You'll give your Modern Poet his Writ of Ease; For by th'Example of the King of Spain, He resolves ne'r to trouble you again.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE AT COURT. He Addresses himself to the Pit. This refers to the Authors purpose of Retirement, at that time when his Majesty recommended this Plot to him. As to a dying Lamp, one drop of Oyl Gives a new Blaze, and makes it live a while; So th'Author seeing his decaying Light, And therefore thinking to retire from sight, Was hindred by a Ray from th'upper Sphere, Just at that time he thought to disappear; He chanc'd to hear his Majesty once say He lik'd this Plot: he staid; and writ the Play; So should Obsequious Subjects catch the Minds Of Princes, as your Sea-men do the Winds. If this Attempt then shews more Zeal, than Light, 'T may teach you to Obey, though not to Write. He looking up and seeing the King starts. Ha! he is there himself. He Kneels. He Rises. Pardon my sight, My Eyes were dazled with Excess of Light; Even so the Sun, who all things else displays, Is hid from us i'th' Glory of his Rays; Will You vouchsafe Your Presence? You, that were given To be our Atlas, and support our Heaven? Will You (Dread Sir) Your Pretious Moments lose To Grace the first Endeavours of our Muse, This with Your Character most aptly suits Even Heaven it self is pleas'd with the first Fruits.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">THE SCENE SEVIL.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The First Act. THE SCENE DON HENRIQVE's HOUSE. Enter Don Henrique, who is immediately follow'd by Sylvio. Sylvio. Signior, Don Carlos is without. Henr. Wait on him in. Enter Carlos. Car. Cozin, to me this day hath longer seem'd than usual, Since 'tis so far advanc'd without our seeing one another. Henr. Me thinks so too; but you repair your Stay, By coming hither opportunely now; You have so often born with my Distempers, 'Tis fit that once at least you should partake Of my Good humour. Car. What ere the Cause may be (I'm sure) I joy In the Effect, and may it long continue. Henr. I can inform you by experience now, How great a satisfaction 'tis to find A Heart and Head eas'd of a weighty care; For a Gentleman of my warm temper, Jealous of the Honour of his Family, (Yet never blemish'd) to be fairly freed From the Tuition of an Orphan Sister, Rich, Beautiful, and Young. Car. You know, Don Henrique, that for divers years, Your Friend has been with the like Province charg'd, A tender Sister, by our Parents will, (When they were call'd from all their Cares below) To mine committed; and though more expos'd Still to the world than yours; and (Sir) unless Nearness of blood deceive me, short of few In the advantages that draw Pretenders; Yet thanks to my Temper, Cozin, as well As to her Virtue, I have seen her grow Up from her Childhood, to her Dangerous Age, Without the least Disturbance to my rest: And when with equal Justice I reflect On the great Modesty and Circumspection Of lovely Porcia, I conclude, that you Might well have slept as Undisturb'd as I. Henr. Sir, I complain not of my Sisters conduct; But you know well, young Maids are so expos'd To the Invasion of audacious men, And to the Malice of their envious Sex, You must confess the Confines of their Fame Are never safe till guarded by a Husband; The wisdom of Relations ought to use Preventions of all sorts; but dear Carlos, The Blemish once received, no Wash is good For stains of Honor, but th'Offenders blood. Car. Y'are too severe a Judge of point of Honor. Henr. And therefore having not long since receiv'd The news, that Don Antonio Pimentel, Is likely to be here this night from Flanders; To whom my Sister by Velladas means, (Our common Friend and Patron) is contracted; I will not close these eyes till I have seen Her, and my Cares, safe lodg'd within his arms. Car. I find your travels, Cozin, have not cur'd you Of that innate Severity to Women, Which grows to be a National reproach Unto us all abroad; the world laments That miserable Sex amongst us here, Born onely to be honorable Prisoners; The more of Quality, the Closer kept; Which Cruelty is reveng'd upon our selves, Whilst by Immuring those whom most we Love, We sing and sigh onely to Iron Grates. As cruel is that over-cautious use, By Proxy to contract Parties Unknown To one another; this is onely fit For Soveraign Princes, whose high qualities Will not allow of previous interviews; âThey sacrifise their Love to Publick good, âConsulting onely Interest and Blood. A custom, which as yet I never knew Us'd between persons of a Lower rank, Without a sequel of sad Consequence: Sir, understand me right; I speak not this By way of Prophecy; I am no stranger To Don Antonios great reputation, Which I believe so just, I no way doubt Your Sisters being happy in him. Hen. Don Carlos, let us quit this Argument; I now am going to our noble friend And kinsman the Corigidor, to see If he will honor with his Company My Sisters Wedding; will you come along? Car. Most willingly; as soon as I have brought My Sister hither, and left her with yours. Henr. I have some business, Cozin, by the way, I'l go before, and wait you i'th' Piazza. Your Servant, Cozin. Henrique waits on him to the door. [Exit Carlos. This Kinsman is my bosom friend, and yet Of all men living, I must hide from him My deep resentments of his Sisters scorn; That cruel Maid, to wound me to the Heart, Then close her Ears against my just complaints; But though as yet I cannot heal my wound, I may, by my Revenge upon my Rival Divert the Pain; and I will drive it home; There's in Revenge a Balm, which will appease The present grief, and Time cure the disease. [Exit Henrique. Enter Porcia. Porcia. My heart is so opprest, with fear and grief, That it must break, unless it find relief; The Man I love is forc'd to flie my sight, And like a Parthian, kills me in his flight: One whom I never saw, I must embrace, Or else destroy the honour of my race. A Brothers Care, more cruel than his Hate; O how perplext is my unhappy fate! Enter Carlos and Camilla. Car. Cozin, I thought my Sisters company Would not displease you, whilst I wait upon Your Brother in a visit. Porc. Sir, you oblige me with a welcom favour; (aside ... )I rather should have stil'd it Charity, To bring a friend to her, whose cruel fate Has robb'd her of her self.( ... aside) aside. Cam. Me thinks, 'tis pitty that a wall should make The houses two, of friends so entirely one, As you, and I, and our two Brothers are. Porc. If it be true, that Lovers live much more, There where they Love, than where they Breath, I'm sure No walls can sever us, w' are still together. Car. Were I not much engag'd, I would not quit So sweet a Conversation; but, Sister, At my return, I'l wait upon you home. Porc. For this night, Cozin, pray let her be mine, I beg it of you both. Car. You may command, we are both yours. [Exit Carlos. Porcia throws her self on Camillas neck. Porc. My dear Camilla, how I long'd to have thee, Where freely breathing out my Grief, I might Some mitigation from thy Pitty find; âBut since there's no true Pitty without Pain; Why should I Ease, by thy Affliction gain? Cam. Ah Porcia! if Compassion Suffering be, And to Condole be Pain; my Destiny Will full revenge in the same kind afford; Should I, but my unequal'd griefs relate, And you, but equally participate. Porc. If yours, as mine, from Love-disasters rise, Our Fates are more alli'd than Families. Cam. What, to our Sex, and blooming age can prove An anguish worthy of our Sighs, but Love? Porc. 'Tis true, Camilla, were your fate like mine, Hopeless to hold, unable to resign. Cam. Let's tell our Stories, then we soon shall see, Which of us two excells in Misery. Porc. Cozin, agreed. Cam. Do you begin then. After a little pause. Porc. You know, Camilla, best, how generously, How long, and how discreetly, my Octavio Hath serv'd me; and what trials of his faith And fervour I did make, ere I allow'd The least hope to sustain his noble Love. Cozin, all this you know; 'twas in your House We had our interviews; where you were pleas'd To suffer feign'd addresses to your Self, To cover from my watchful Brother's eyes, The real passion which he had for me. Cam. My memory in this needs no refreshing. Porc. And how one Evening (O that fatal hour) My Brother passing by Don Carlos house, With his great Friend and Confident Don Pedro, Did chance to see th'unfortunate Octavio, At your Balcony, entertaining me, Whom not believing there, he took for you; Where mad with Jealousie, his cruel nature (To which all Moderation is unknown) Resolves to stamp all your Neglects of him, In's suppos'd Rival poor Octavio's heart; He, and his Friend both draw, Octavio Retires, they assault him, who in's own defence Does kill Don Pedro, and is forc'd to flie. My Brother cruelly pursues him still, With such insatiate thirst after revenge, That nothing but Octavio's blood can quench; Yet covering still his Rage and Jealousie, With the resentment of Don Pedro's death. Cam. Is this the sum of your sad story, Porcia? Is this all? Por. No, no, Camilla, 'tis the Prologue onely, The Tragedy does follow; this Tyrant, This cruel Brother, to th'Impetuous Laws Of whose Tuition, our deceased Parents My Person and my Fortune have condemn'd, In his unjust Suspition restless grown, (Which he to palliate Vice with Virtues name, Does Sense of Honor call) takes an Allarm, And starts at every shadow; as if reproach Attended all the actions of a Sister, Though ne'r so Circumspect; and uses me, As if the Honor of our Family Were over-thrown for ever, should my Eyes, Or Judgment, be but the least part allow'd In making choice of him should be my Husband. Therefore to frustrate all my hopes at once, He has already marri'd me by Proxie, To one in Flanders, whom I never saw, Who is this very night expected here. Cam. Is such a rigour possible, dear Porcia? Por. Was ever Miserie like mine, Camilla? Heightned to such extremes, past all relief? If I acquaint my Brother with my Love T'Octavio, the man he most does Hate, I must expect the worst effects of fury; If I endeavour to Forget Octavio, Even that attempt renews his memory, And fresh Disquiet gives; If I refuse To marry, I am lost; If I obey, I cast Octavio and my self away. Two such Extremes of ill, no Choice admit, Each seems the Worst; on which Rock shall I split? Since if I marry, I cannot survive; And not to marry; were to die alive. Cam. Your Story (I confess) is strangely moving; Yet if you could my Fortune weigh with yours, In Scales of equal Sensibility, You would not change your Sufferings, for mine. Por. What can there be in Nature more afflicting, Than a Divorce from th'Object of our Love, For ever, to embrace the thing we Hate? Cam. Have you not known that Object of your Love? And entertain'd the Person you esteem? Have you not heard, and answered to his Sighs? Has he not born his Part in all your Cares? Do not you live, and reign within his heart? Por. I doubt no more his Faith, than my hard Fate. Cam. But tell me, dearest Porcia, if I love One, I ne'r shall see, and suffer as much Without the Means of e'r expressing it, As what I suffer is above expression; If all my Sighs wander in fleeting Air, And ne'r can reach his ears for whom they're form'd; If all my Passion, all my killing Cares, Must be for ever to their Cause unknown; If that their weight must sink me to my Grave, Without one Groan that he can ever hear, Or the least hope, that I should e'r obtain By Pitty Ease, or Cure by his Disdain: If this the state of my Misfortune be, Say, dearest Porcia, do you envie me? Por. What over-cruel Laws of Decency Have struck you dumb? have you misplac'd your Love, On such a Subject, as you dare not own? Cam. No, the Cause is worthy of the Effect; And though I had no Passion for his Person, I were Ungrateful if I should not give The first place in my Heart to such high Merit. Por. If he has been so Generous, to deserve Your Love, why are not you so Just, to let Him know it? Cam. 'Tis impossible; Ah! that dismal word Does fully state the difference of our Fortunes: You, in your first Adventure have been crost, But I, before I can set out am lost. Por. Pray make me comprehend this Mystery. Cam. 'Tis t'open my wounds afresh, dear Porcia, After a little pause. But You must be obey'dâ The Conde de Onniate being sent Embassadour unto the Emperour; We having th'honor to be near ally'd To him, by his Lady, (who likewise went That Journey with her Husband) my Brother Was desir'd by her to make that Voiage; Whose tenderness for me, not suffering him To let me stay behind, I was ingag'd; And treated by th'Ambassadress, my Cozin, With more respect than I could ever merit. Por. She's a Lady, fam'd for great Civility. Cam. We had not pass'd much time i'th' Emp'ror's Corut, When my dear Brother unexpectedly, By urgent business, was call'd back to Sevil; And in our return (too near a Garison Of th'Enemies) our Convoy was surpriz'd, And routed by a Party of their Horse. Por. Camilla, you begin to raise my fears. Cam. We Prisoners made, were hurri'd streight away To their Quarters, where my malicious Fate Made me appear too pleasing to the Eyes Of their Commander; who at first approach Pretends to Parly in a Lovers style, Protesting that my Face had chang'd our Fortunes, And him my Captive made: But finding soon How little he advanc'd in his Design By Flattery, and his feign'd Submission; He shifts his Person, calls me his Prisoner, And swears my Virgin-Treasure was his Prize; And yet protests he had much rather owe it To my Indulgence, than his own Good Fortune; And so through Storms and Calms, the Villain still Pursues his Course to his accursed End; But finding me inflexible to Threats As well as Fawnings, he resolves to use The last, and uncontroled Argument Of Impious Men in Power, Force. Por. Ah poor Camilla! tell me, where was then Your Brother, at a time of such distress? Cam. My Brother? he, alas, was long before Born away from me, in the first Incounter; Where having certainly behav'd himself As did become his Nation and his Name, Remain'd sore wounded in another House. Por. Pr'ythee make haste to free me from this fright. Cam. The Brute approaches, and by Violence Endeavours to accomplish his intent; I Heaven invoke, and strong Resistance make, But with Unequal force, though Rage suppli'd Those Spirits, which my Fear had put to flight; Breathless at length with crying out, and striving, I spi'd a Dagger by the Villain's side, Which snatching boldly out, as my last refuge, With his own Arms I wound the Savage Beast; He, at the stroke, unseas'd me, and gave back; (âSo Guilt produces Cowardice) then I The Dagger pointing to my breast, cri'd out, Villain, keep off, for if thou dost persist, I'l be my self both Sacrifise and Priest; I boldly now defie thy Lust, and Hate; âShe that dares Choose to die, may Brave her Fate. Immediately the Drums and Trumpets sound, Pistols go off, and a great cry, To Arms, To Arms: The Lustful Satyr flies; I stand Fix'd with amazement to the Marble floor, Holding my Guardian Dagger up aloft, As if the Ravisher had threatned still. Por. I fancy thee, Camilla, in that brave posture, Like a noble Statue, which I remember To have seen, of the inraged Juno, VVhen she had robb'd Jove of his Thunderbolt. Cam. Freed from this Fright, my Spirits flow so fast To the forsaken Chanels of my Heart, That those who by their orderly access Would have Supported life, by Throngs oppress. O're-charg'd with Joy, I fell into a Swoon; And what was done in this Parenthesis Is not within the Circle of my Knowledge. Por. Y' have rais'd me to a mighty Expectation; VVill the Adventure answer it, Camilla? Cam. At my return to life, op'ning my eyes, Think, dearest Porcia, how I was astonish'd, To find there kneeling by my side, a Man, Of a most noble Form, who bowing to me, Madam, (says he) y'are welcome to the world; Pardon, I pray, the Boldness of a Stranger, That humbly sues t'you to Continue in it; Or if You needs will Leave us, stay at least Till I shall have Reveng'd your wrongs, and then I'l wait upon you to the other world, For You with-drawn, this will a Desert seem, And Life a Torment. Por. High gallantry, Cozin, for a first Address. Cam. 'Twas so Surprizing, that my Confusion Check'd my Reply: but I suppose my Looks Did speak the grateful Language of my Heart; For I perceiv'd an Air of Joy enlighten His manly Face; but, O! it soon was clowded, By fresh Allarms; We heard the Soldiers cry, Where's Antonio, th'Enemy is ralli'd, And coming on to give a Second Charge; He started up, and with a Meen, that mark'd The Conflict 'twixt his Honor and his Love; Madam, (says he) the Soul was never yet With such Convulsion from the Body torn, As I from you; but it must ne'r be said, That Don Antonio Pimentel was seen To Follow in Dangers those he ought to Lead; And thus the Vanquish'd Conqueror Disappear'd, Leaving that Image stamp'd upon my Heart, To which I all the Joys must Sacrifice Of the poor remnant of my wretched Life; If properly to live I may be said, She puts her Handkerchief to her Eyes. When all my hopes of Seeing him are dead. Por. What said you was his name, Camilla? Cam. Don Antonio Pimentel, I told you. Por. O Heavens! Antonio Pimentel? Enter Henrique. Hen. I'm pleas'd to find you Speaking of your Husband. Cam. What's that I hear? her Husband? Aside. Hen. Have you the Letter ready, I desir'd you To write to him? I'l send a Servant with it, To meet him on the way, 'twill shew Respect. Porc. You know my Obedience, Brother. Hen. 'Tis well, Sister. Enter Sylvio. Sylv. Sir, here's a Servant of Don Antonio, Newly alighted at the Gate; he's come Post from his Master, charg'd with Letters for You. Hen. You ne'r could bring me a more welcom News; Call him in, Sylvio: Sister, you may With-draw, and take this time to ask your Cozin, How she likes my Choice of your Wedding-Cloathes. Por. My Wedding-Cloathes? Ah! miserable Maid! The Heathen so to their Feign'd Deities Adorn'd the Victims they did Sacrifice. [Exeunt Porcia &amp; Camilla. Enter Ernesto and Sylvio. Ern. Signior, Don Antonio kisses your hands, And sends me to present this Letter to you. [He gives a Letter to Don Henrique. Don Henrique opens it, and seeming to have read it to himself, says, Hen. I'm glad you left him well; but yet me thinks, He writes doubtfully of his being here This night, as I expected. Ern. His Letter, I suppose, declares his purpose. Henr. I'l answer't, and dispatch you presently. In the mean while go make him welcom, Sylvio. Exeunt Sylvio and Ernesto at one door, and Henrique at the other. Enter Sylvio, Ernesto, Geraldo, Pedro, with some Cups of Chocolate. Sylv. Meethinks, Camerade, a soop of Chocolate Is not amiss after a tedious Journey; He drinks. Your Master's Health, Sir. Ern. I'l do you reason, Sir. Sylv. Pray how long is't, Brother, since you left Spain? Ern. 'Tis now five years, and upward, since I went From Sevil, with my Master, into Flanders, The King's Fencing-School; where all his Subjects, Given to Fighting, are taught the Use of Arms, And notably kept in breath. Sylv. Your Master, I am sure, has got the Fame To be a Per'lous man in that rough Trade. Ern. He's a brave Soldier, Envy must confess it. Pedr. It seems so i'faith, since meerly by the force Of his great Reputation, he can take our Bright Young Mistris so, without a Siege. Ern. I hope she'l be Reveng'd on him ere long, And take him too, by the force of her Wit, And Beautie. Pedr. S'has more than a Child's Portion, Sir, of both, I dare assure you. Sylv. But, pr'ythee, Brother, instruct me a little, Tell me, what kind of Country is this Holland, That's so much talk'd of, and so much fought for. Ern. Why, Friend, 'tis a huge Ship at Anchor, fraught With a sort of Creatures, made up of Turf, And Butter. Pedr. I pray, Sir, what do they drink in that Country? 'Tis said, there's neither Fountains there, Nor Vines. Aside. Ern. This is the Butler sure by his apt question. Friend, they drink there a certain muddy Liquor, Made of that Grain with which you feed your Mules. Pedr. What? Barley? can that Liquor quench their thirst? Ern. You'd scarce believe it did, had you but seen How oft they drink. Pedr. But, me-thinks, that should make them drunk, Camera. Ern. Indeed most Strangers do think so, but they Themselves believe it not, because they're so, So often. Ger. A Nation sure of Walking Tuns; the World Has not the like. Ern. Pardon me, Friend, there is but a great Ditch Betwixt them and such another Nation; If these Good-fellows would but Joyn, and drink That drie, i'faith they might shake hands. Ger. Pr'ythee, Friend, can these Dutch Borraccios Fight? Ern. They can do even as well, for they can Pay Those that can fight. Sylv. But where, I pr'ythee, do they get their Money? Ern. Oh, Friend, they have a Thriving Mystery; They Cheat their Neighbouring Princes of their Trade, And then they Buy their Subjects for their Soldiers. Sylv. Me-thinks our Armies should beat these Dull Fellows Out of the World. Ern. These Dull Fellows will sooner beat our Armies Out of their Country; Why, Friend, ready Mony Will do much more, in Camps, as well as Courts, Than a Ready Wit, I dare assure you. Ger. What a Gods name could come into the Heads Of this People, to make them Rebell? Ern. Why Religion, that came into their Heads A Gods name. Ger. But what a Devil made the Noble-men Rebel? Ern. Why that which made the Devil himself Rebel, Ambition. Sylv. This is a pleasant Fellow; Aside. I find that you Soldiers do not want Wit. Ern. But I find he wants Wit that is a Soldier. Gentlemen, your Company's very good, But I have business that requires Dispatch. Pedr. Will you not mend your Draught before you go? Ern. I thank you, Sir, I have done very well. [Exeunt. Enter Camilla, Porcia, Flora. Por. Was e'r Misfortune like to mine, Camilla? Cam. Was e'r Disaster, Porcia, like to mine? Por. That I must never see Octavio more. Cam. That I again must Don Antonio see, Never to see him Mine. Por. I, to be marri'd to the Man I Hate. Cam. And I, to have the Man I Love, torn from me. Por. I am, by Robbing of my Friend, undone. Cam. And I (alas) by Yielding, ruine both. Por. Ye Powers, who these intangled fortunes give, She weeps. Instruct us how to Die, or how to Live. Cam. Cozin, when we should Act, then to Complain, Is Childishly to beat the Air in vain. These Descants on our Griefs do but Perplex, Let's seek the Remedy; You know, our Sex This Honor bears from Men, in Exigents Of Love, never to want Expedients. Por. You have awaken'd me, give me your Veil, Quickly, my Dearest, quickly; and You, Flora, Porcia takes off Camilla's Veil and puts it on upon her self. Run and see if my Brother be setled To the Dispatching of Antonio's Man. [Exit Flora. Cam. What mean you, Porcia? Por. If once my Brother be set down to write, I may securely reckon one hour mine; His Wits are onely in his Choler quick And his Hand ready in Revenge; he's so Extravagantly Jealous, he distrusts The Meaning of his own ill-chosen Words, And so at length can hardly fix on any. This Time I will make use of to go see Octavio, and let him know that the last Term Of all our Hopes is ready to Expire, Unless his VVit, his Courage, and his Love, Some quick Expedient find for our Relief. Cam. Why, How, and VVhere d'you hope to speak with him? Por. In his own House, where he does lie conceal'd, 'Tis not far off, and I will venture thither. Cam. Know you the way? Por. Not very well, but Flora's a good Guide. Enter Flora hastily. Flo. O Madam! he's coming already. Por. Ah spiteful Destiny! let us retire, Cozin, into my Chamber. [Exeunt Porcia and Camilla. Enter Henrique and Ernesto. Henr. If you desire to speak with her, you may. Ern. I should be very glad to tell my Master That I have had th'Honour to see his Bride. Henr. Where's your Lady, Flora? Flor. She's in her Chamber, Signior. Henr. Tell her, Antonio's Servant does desire To do his Duty to her, ere he goes. [Exit Flora. Friend, you will find her there, without a Veil, In her Home Dress, but you are privileg'd For this free Access, by your Relation. Whilst you wait on her, I'l go end my Letter. [Exit Henrique. Enter Camilla, Porcia, and Flora. Por. If thou lov'st me, get him quickly away, Before my Brother come, and give him this. She gives Flora a Letter. Ernesto addresses himself to Camilla, seeing her without a Veil. Ern. Madam, I have been bold to beg the Honor Of Seeing you, to make my self more welcome To my Lord, at my return. Por. A rare Mistake, further it, dear Camilla. Aside. Who knows what Good this Error may produce? Cam. Friend, in what state left you your Lord and mine? Ern. As happy as the Hopes of being Yours Ought certainly to make him, Madam. Cam. I would the Master were as easily deceiv'd. Aside. I pray present my Humble Service to him: Flora, give him the Letter; Farewel. [Exeunt Camilla, Porcia, and Flora. Ern. Now by my Life, she is a lovely Lady; My Master will be ravish'd with her Form; I hope the Bargain, which her Brother made, By th'interposal of Vellada's Power, (Though founded onely in Interest) may prove As happy a Marriage, as any other Made after th'Old fashion, chiefly for Love; And that so rare a Beauty may have power To bring him back to his right Wits again From his wild Ravings on an unknown Dame, Whom as he fancies (once upon a time) He recover'd from a Trance, that is, From a sound Sleep, to make him Dream e'r since. I'l hasten to him with this pleasing news. [Exit Ernesto. Enter Camilla, Porcia, Flora. Cam. My Melancholy could hardly hinder me From laughing at the Formal Fools mistake; But tell me, did not I present your Pers'nage With assurance? the way for both to thrive, Is to make me your Representative. Smiling. Por. Most willingly, and I am confident, When you, your Charms shall to his heart apply, You all your Rivals safely may defie. Cam. I wish I could be vain enough to hope it. But, Cozin, my Despairs are so Extreme, I can't be flatter'd, though but in a Dream. Flo. Madam, do we go, or what d'you resolve on? Por. I must resolve, I see, yet know not what. Cam. Cozin, take heed, I am afraid you venture Too much, your Brother cannot tarry long; And, if returning, he should find you missingâ Por. Y'have reason, the opportunity is lost, What is't a Clock, Flora? Flo. I think near Eight, for the Clock struck seven, Just as Camilla enter'd the Chamber. Por. Quick then, Flora, fetch your Veil, you shall carry My Tablets to Octavio, there he'l find The Hour and Place where I would have him meet. [Exit. Flora. Cam. 'Tis well resolv'd; but where do you design Your Meeting? Por. In the Remotest part of all the Garden, Which answers (as you know) to my apartment; And Flora has the Key of the Back-door. Cam. As the Case stands, you choose the fittest place. [Flora returns Veil'd. Por. Cozin, I beg your patience whilst I write. Porcia writes in her Tablets. Cam. You, Flora, by this Accident may chance To see your faithful Lover Diego. Flo. He is a faithful Lover of himself, Without a Rival, Madam. Cam. Damsel, your Words and Thoughts do not agree; For could we see his Image in your Heart, 'Twould be a fairer far, than ere his Glass Reflected. Flo. Madam, I am not yet so very Old, That I should Dote. Cam. Nor yet so very Young, but you may Love. Dotage and Love are Cozin-germans, Flora. Smiling. Flo. Yes, when we Love, and are not lov'd again; For else, I think, they're not so near a kin. Aside. Cam. I've touch'd a Nettle, and have stung my self. Porcia give Flora the Tablets, having lock'd them. Por. Make haste, dear Flora. Flo. Madam, I'l flie. Should I not play my part, I were to blame, Aside. Since all my Fortune's betted on her game. Madam, has Octavio the other Key Belonging to the Tablets. Por. Yes, yes, I pray make haste. [Exit Flora. Let us retire, Camilla a little Rest, And Meditation, may new aids suggest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND ACT. THE SCENE, The City of SEVIL. Enter Don Antonio and Sancho in Riding-Cloathes. San. Sir, we are arriv'd in very good time. An. I did not think it would have been so soon, By an hour at least, but Lovers ride apace. Why smile you, Sancho? San. Faith at the Novelty of your Amours, To fall in Love with one, you Scarcely saw, And marry one, you Never saw; 'tis pretty: But we poor Mortals have another Method. An. Y'are very pleasant; this, Sancho, is the place, VVhere I charg'd Ernesto to expect me, VVhom I sent before to my Brother-in-Law; But with this Order, not to let him know, That I intended to arrive this Evening: Surprizes in Love-meetings render Men More welcome, and have more of Gallantry. San. Since you are here, Sir, earlier than you thought; VVhy might you not go shift you at the Post-house? And be back here, before Ernesto come, Howe're, 'tis better, that he wait for you, Than you for him i'th' open Street. An. 'Tis well thought on; come, let's to the Post-house. [Exeunt. Enter Don Octavio, and Diego. Oct. Come, Diego, 'tis time to quit our Lurking-holes, And to begin our Chase. Die. Of what, Sir? Bats, or Owls, now the Sun's set? Call you this making of Love? me-thinks, 'tis More like making of VVar; marching all night In Arms, as if we design'd to Beat up The Enemies Quarters. Oct. VVhy would'st not thou venture as much for Flora? Die. No in good faith; I shall venture enough If e'r I Marry her; I'l run no hazard, (By my good-will) before-hand. Oct. That's from your Fear, not Prudence, Diego. Die. Sir, you may call it what you please, but I Dare boldly say, there lives not in the world A more Valiant Man, than I, whilst Danger Does keep its Distance; but when sawcily It presses on, then (I confess) 'tis true, I have a certain Tenderness for Life, That checks my Ardor, and enclines my Prudence Timely to withdraw. Oct. Your Style is wondrous civil to your self; How you Soften that harsh word, call'd Cowardice; But the Danger is not always evident, VVhen you are pleas'd, my Friend, to Run away. Die. It may be so, Sir, not to Vulgar eyes; But I have such a peircing sight, that can Discover Perils out of others Ken; VVhich, they not seeing soon enough to Shun, Are forc'd t'Encounter; and then their strugling Is, by th'unwarie world, taken for Courage. Oct. You have more Light, Diego, I see, than Heat; But I'l allow your VVit and Honesty To come to Composition for your want Of Courage; though it be a Quality I may have use of; but we lose our time. VVas ever Lover's Fate so rude as mine? Condemn'd to Darkness, forc'd to hide my Head, As well as Love? and to do me a Spight, Fortune has Contradictions reconcil'd, I am at once a Prisoner, and Exil'd. Enter Antonio and Sancho. Ant. Me-thinks, Ernesto should not tarry long, If not already come; Sancho, how call you The Street there just before us? where you see You Gentleman with his Cloak o're his face; I have quite lost the memory of this place. San. I am as much to seek, as you, Sir. Ant. Let us go to him, Sancho, and enquire; He has a notable good Meen; me-thinks, I ne'r saw an Air more like Octavio's. Oct. Unless my eyes do very much deceive me, 'Tis Don Antonio; if it be he, Diego, Octavio lets fall his Cloak from before his face. There is no danger in his knowing us; He ever was my faithful friend; 'Tis he. Ant. You injure me, Octavio, to be so long A knowing one, who is so intirely yours. They emrabce. Oct. Your presence, here, noble Antonio, was So unexpected, that I hardly durst Believe my eyes; VVhen came you to this Town? Ant. I am just now arriv'd Oct. I joy to see you here, but should have thought It likelier to have heard of you at Court, Pursuing there the Recompences due To your transcendent Merit. Ant. That is no place for men of my Moralitie. I have been taught, Octavio, to Deserve, But not to Seek Reward; that does prophane The Dignity of Virtue; if Princes For their own Interests will not advance Deserving Subjects, they must raise Themselves By a brave Contempt of Fortune. Oct. I'm glad to find in you some Seeds yet left Of th'Antient Virtue; may they Fruit produce Fit to Illustrate, and Instruct the Age. Let me once more embrace you, Sir, Welcome, Brave Leader. Ant. Oh, you must spare your Servants, Sir. Oct. He has not liv'd i'th' reach of publick Fame, Who has not heard your noble Character; This is my house, be pleas'd, Sir, to go in, And make it yours; though truly at the present I am in a very ill condition To receive the Honor of such a Guest; Having by an unlucky accident, Been forc'd of late to keep my self conceal'd. Ant. I humbly thank you, Sir, but cannot yet Receive that favour, for I here must stay Expecting the Return of one, I sent Before to town to my Brother-in-Law. Oct. Have you a Brother-in-law in Sevil? You surprize me much. An. It is most true, Octavio, I come hither A Marri'd man, as far as friends can make me. Oct. Since it imports you not to miss your Servant, Let us stay here without, untill he come; And then go in, and rest your self a while. But how go our publick Affairs in Flanders? Ant. I left our Armies in a better state, Than formerly. Oct. And our brave Vellada (I suppose) in great Reputation. Ant. The Honor of our Country, and the Terror Of others; Fortune consulted Reason, When she bestow'd such Favours upon him. Oct. They say he did Wonders at the Relief Of Juliers. Ant. It was indeed a famous Action. Oct. You'l much oblige me, if whilst you expect Your Servant here, I might learn from your self Some few particulars of your own Actions; Fame speaks Loudly of them, but not Distinctly. Ant. âFame, like Water, bears up the Lighter things, âAnd lets the Weighty sink; I am not us'd To speak in the First person; but if needs You'l have a story to fill up the time, I'l tell you an Adventure of mine own, Where you'l find Love so intermixt with Arms, That (I am confident) 'twill raise your wonder, How being prepossess'd with such a Passion, I should (upon Prudential motives onely) Be ingag'd (as now you find me) to Marry A Lady whom I never saw. Oct. The Person, and the Subject, Sir, do challenge My best attention. After a little pause. Ant. The following Evening to that glorious Day, Wherein our great Vellada gain'd such Fame, Against the cautelous Nassaw; some Horse Were sent from th'Armie, under my command To cover the Limbourg Frontiers, expos'd To th'Enemies Inroads; scarce setled there, I receiv'd intelligence, that a Party Of theirs (about two hundred Horse) were come That very Evening to a neighbouring Village, Intending there to lodge; I instantly Cause Sound to Horse, and march to their Surprize So luckilie, that by the break of day Their Quarters were on fire. Oct. You had been taught, Sir, by our wise General, That Diligence in Execution is Even above Fortune, Mistris of Success. Ant. They made but faint resistance; some were slain, Some perish'd in the flames, others escap'd, Giving th'Alarm in Quarters more remote To their Companions drown'd in Sleep and Wine; Who, at the Out-cry, and the Trumpets sound, Me-thinks I fancie starting from their Beds, As pale and wan, as from their Dormitories Those the last Trump shall rouze; differing in this, That they awake to Live, but these to Die. Oct. How Unsafe it is to be Secure! Ant. Finding no more resistance, I made haste To a lofty Structure, which I conceiv'd To be the likeliest Quarter for their Chief; Led thither by desire to rescue both; Him, from the Soldier's rage; That, from the Fire. Oct. A care most worthy of a gallant Leader. Ant. But think, Octavio, how I was surpriz'd, When, on the floor of a Pavillion, Belonging to the Garden of that House, I found a Woman of a Matchless Form, Extended all along. Oct. I easily can divine how such a Heart, As harbours in the brave Antonio's breast, May suffer at so Sad a Spectacle. Ant. At the first sight I did believe her Dead; Yet, in that state so Awful she appear'd, That I approach'd her with as much Respect, As if the Soul had animated still That Body, which, though Dead, scarce Mortal seem'd. But as the Sun from our Horizon gone, His Beams do leave a Tincture on the Skies, Which shews it was not long since he withdrew; So in her lovely face there still appear'd Some scatter'd streaks of those Vermillion Beams, Which us'd t'irradiate that bright Firmament. Thus did I find that distress'd Miracle, Able to Wound a Heart, as if alive, Uncapable to Cure it, as if dead. Oct. I no more doubt your Pitty, than your Wonder. Ant. My Admiration did suspend my Aid, Till Passion join'd to Pitty, made me bold; I kneel'd, and took her in my arms, then bow'd Her body gently forward; with which motion, A Sigh stole from her; O th'ravishing sound! Which being a Symptom of remaining life, Made me forget it was a sign of Grief. At length she faintly opens her bright eyes; So breaks the Day; and so do all the Creatures Rejoice, as I did, at the new born Light: But as the Indians, who adore the Sun, Are scorch'd by's Beams, ere Half his Race be Run; So I, who did adore her Rising Eyes, Found my self Wounded by those Deities. Oct. How you have rais'd my Expectation! Pray release me quickly. Ant. From her fair hand a bloody Poniard fell, Which she held fast during her Trance, as if Sh'ad onely needed Arms whilst she did Sleep, And trusted to her Eyes when she did Wake. What I said to her, being a production Of meer Extasie, I remember not; She made me no Reply, yet I discern'd In a Serener Air of her pale face, Some Lines of Satisfaction mix'd with Fear. Oct. Such looks in Silence have an Eloquence. But pray go on. Ant. Rais'd from the ground, and to her self return'd, I stept a fitting distance back; as well To gaze upon that lovely Apparition, As to express Respect; when at that instant The Trumpets sound a Charge; my Soldiers crie, Where is our Leader? where's Antonio? My Love a while disputed with my Honor, But that the longer setled Power o'r-came, And fear of Future danger to her Person Made me then seek the Present for my self; I came up to my Troops, left in Reserve, As they were ready to receive a Charge From divers Squadrons of fresh Horse, who being Quarter'd in Neighbouring Villages, had taken Hotly th'Alarm, and came (though then too late) In succour of their friends; Honor and Love Had so inflam'd my heart, that I advanc'd Beyond the Rules of Conduct, and receiv'd So many wounds, that I with faintness fell. Oct. How can this Story end! Ant. My Soldiers beat th'Enemy, and brought me off, Where Surgeons quickly cur'd my Outward Wounds, But the remembrance of that Heroine, My Inward Hurts kept bleeding still afresh; Till by the business of the War constrain'd To attend my Charge i'th' Army, my despair Of ever finding her, concurring with The powerful perswasions of Vellada, I was at length even forc'd to an Engagement Of Marriage with a Lady of this City, Rich, Noble, and, as they say, Beautiful. And so you have me here, come to Consummate Those Nuptial Rites, to which my Interest, And th'Importunity of Friends advice, O're-rule my judgment, though against my heart. Oct. A wonderful Adventure! but pray, Sir, May I not take the liberty to ask you, Who may this noble Lady be, to whom The Fates have destin'd so much Happiness? Ant. I have no Reserves for you, 'tis the Sister Ofâ Enter Ernesto, and Octavio retires hastily, and covers his face with his Cloak. Antonio holding to Octavio. It is my Servant, Sir. Oct. Step to Antonio, Diego, and desire him To send him off. Ant. I will immediately; Well, Ernesto, Diego goes to Antonio, and whispers. What good news? speak freely. Ern. Sir, as you charg'd me, I told your Brother-in-Law, I thought you hardly could be there this night; He kisses your hands, and bad me tell you, That he expects your coming with impatience; He charg'd me to present you with this Letter; Th'other is from your beauteous Bride, a person The most accomplish'd that I ever saw. My being yours gave me the privilege Of a Domestick, in the free admission To see her in her Chamber-dress, without A Veil, either to cover Faults, or hide Perfections. Ant. Tell me truly, is she so very handsom? Ern. Handsomer far in my opinion, Sir, Than all the Bruxels Beauties, which you call The Finish'd Pieces; but I'l say no more; Let your own Eyes inform you; here's a Key Of the Apartment, that's made ready for you; A Lower Quarter, very nobly furnish'd, That opens on St. Vincent's Street. Ant. Give it me; and go you to the Post-house, And take care that my things be brought from thence. [Exit Ernesto. Octavio, will you go along with me, And be a Witness of my first Address? Oct. Sir, you choose in me an Ill Companion For Nuptial Joys, or any Happiness; One, whose Misfortunes to such sad Extremes Are heightned, that the very Mentioning Of Happy hours serves onely to Imbitter The memory of my Lost Joys. Ant. So deep a sense of your Misfortunes, Sir, Is prejudicial to your Self and Friends. Enter Flora in haste. Flo. Where's your Master, Diego? Die. There's some Ill towards, when this Bird appears. Aside. Do you not see him? y'have liv'd too long a Maid. Flo. I have something to say to you in private, Sir, Goes to Octavio. That requires haste. Oct. What new Accident brings you hither, Flora? Flo. These Tablets will inform you, Sir, Farewell. She draws Octavio aside, and puts up her Veil. Die. Will you not stay for an Answer Damsel? Flo. 'Tis a Command, not a Question Diego. Die. Short, and Sweet, Flora. Oct. Good Flora stay a Minute; I much fear It is some new Misfortune. Die. Nay, Sir, you may be sure 'tis some Disaster, Else it would ne'r have come so Easily, And so Unsought for. Bowing to Antonio. Oct. Will you allow me for a Moment, Sir, To step into my House, and read a Letter. Ant. I'l attend you in, and wait your leisure. [Exeunt all but Diego. Die. These little black Books do more Devils raise, Than all the Figures of the Conjurers. What can this be? I have not seen this Damsel With so busie a face; but here she comes Already, 'twas a quick dispatch. Enter Flora, and seems to go away in haste. Die. A Word, Flora, or a kind Glance at least, What? grown cruel? Diego no body w'you? Flo. This is no time for fooling. Die. Nay, if you be so serious, fare you well; Yet I'l perform the Honor of our Street, And bring you to the end on't. Flo. I shall be well holp up with such a Squire; If now some wandring Knight should chance t'assault you, To bear away your Damsel, what would you do? Die. I'd use no other Weapon but a Torch; I'd put aside your Veil, show him your face, That, I suppose, would guard us both. Flo. Why, d'you think it would fright him, Diego? Die. Oh no, 'twould charm him, Flora. Flo. Well, such as 'tis, I'l venture it without Engaging your known Valour. Die. Faith you may so; The face, dear Flora, defends all below. Flo. Away, you Fool; Good-night to you. [Exit Flora. Enter Octavio and Antonio. Oct. (aside ... )What may this be? O my Malignant Fate! The Warning's short, yet she must be Obey'd; The hour draws near; I must go seek a Friend; Her words seem to imply need of a Second; 'Twere barbarous to engage Antonio Newly arriv'd, and come on such an Errand.( ... aside) Noble Antonio, my confusion's great To tell you thus abruptly, I must leave you; Th'occasion's indispensable. Ant. I must not quit you, Sir, I know too well The Laws of Honor, to desert you now: When I my friend in such disorder see, And all the Marks that he is call'd to Danger, To leave him thenâ Oct. It is a Summons from a Lady, Sir, Whom I have lov'd with Passion and Success; To meet her in her Garden presently: All is propitious on her part and mine; But she's so Guarded by a Tyrant Brother, So Jealous naturally, and so Incens'd By that new Accident I told you of, Which makes me a close Prisoner all the day; That to perswade you there no Danger is In this Adventure, were to abuse you; But even for that reason I am bound Not to consent to the Imbarking you In an occasion that's so opposite To what you come for; Antonio, We must As well to Friends as to our Selves be just. Ant. He ought not to pretend to Friendships name, Who reckons not Himself and Friend the same. Oct. Friendship with Justice must not disagree, That were to break the Virtue's Harmony. Ant. Who in his Friends Distresses takes no part, His Friendship's onely in his Tongue, not Heart. Oct. You from a life of Perils hither come To find a Nuptial Bed, not seek a Tomb. Ant. My Friend ingag'd, it never must be said, Antonio left him so to go to Bed. Oct. Y are marri'd, and expose what's not your own. Ant. Wedded to Honor, that must yield to none. Oct. I find, Antonio, you must still subdue. Ant. I ow my Triumph to my Cause, not You. Come, we lose time, your Mistris must not stay. Oct. Who's so accompani'd, needs not fear his way. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE THIRD ACT. The SCENE is, DON HENRIQUE's House. Camilla, Porcia, Flora appear in a Balcone. Por. Come, Cozin, the hour assign'd approaches. Cam. Nay, more than so, for 'tis already night. Flo. And thanks to your Stars sufficiently dark. Por. To the Clowds you would say, Flora, for Stars, In this occasion, would not much befriend us. Pray, Cozin, when Octavio shall arrive, Do you and Flora watch above with care; For if my cruel Brother should surprize usâ Cam. Let us alone to play the Sentinels. Flo. I'm confident he's abroad, and will not Suddenly return; for I heard him say, He'd pass th'Evening at the Corigidors; And thence, you know, he seldom comes home early. Enter Antonio, Octavio, and Diego, with their Cloaks o'r their faces, and their Swords undrawn in their hands. Ant. Is it not something early for Adventures Of this Nature? Oct. 'Tis the Hour she appointed. Ant. How dark 'tis grown o'th' sudden, there's not one Star appears in all the Firmament. Die. So much the better; for when I must fight, Aside. I covet no Spectators of my Prowess. Oct. Stay you here, Antonio, I'l step before, And give the Sign; when you here the door open, Then come on, and follow me in. Enter at the other side of the Stage Henrique and Carlos. Henr. The Corigidors is a pretty place. Car. The Walks do so intice me, I always Wearie my self, before I can retire. Henr. Indeed we have staid longer than we thought, And therefore let's go home the shorter way; The back door of my Garden's here at hand. Car. It will be better than to go about. Above. Por. Would he were come, I fear the Rising Moon Will give us little time. [Octavio knocks upon the Hilt of his Sword. Por. I think I hear his usual Knock; Who's there? Above in the Balcone. Oct. 'Tis I. Por. I hope y'are not alone. Oct. No; here's Diego with me, and a Friend. Por. 'Tis well; I'l open the door presently. Porcia comes down. Henr. Come; we are now hard by the Garden gate. Oct. Let's to the door; sure she's there by this time; Be not afraid Diego. Die. Agree that with him that made me, who has Given me a Heart no bigger than my Thumb; Y'had as good command me not to Breath. Oct. Come on; what art thou thinking on? Die. That I see Company, or that my Fear does. Oct. Y' are in the right; let's to avoid suspit on The noise of a Lock Walk on at large, till they are out of distance. Car. I think I heard your Garden door open. Henr. I think so too; Ha! at this time o'th' night? What can be the meaning on't? 'Tis so. Ant. They have open'd the door; 'tis time for me To follow, surely Octavio is gone in. [Antonio moves towards the door. Por. What stay you for? Holding the door half open. Henr. What's that I hear? sure 'tis Porcia's voice. Por. What mean you to stand there? come in, I say. Henr. Hell and Furies! He goes to draw his Sword. Carl. Be patient, Sir, and you will make a clearer Discovery of your Affront. Por. You may come in securely, Octavio: Setting open the door. I have set those will watch my Brothers coming. Ant. Madam, I am not Octavio. Por. Not Octavio? who are you then? and who's That Shadow there? Henr. I can hold no longer; I'm thy Chastiser, Draws his Sword. Vile Woman, and his Mortal Enemy. Ant. Ha! my Mortal Enemy? Henr. Yes, Villain; who ere thou art, thou shalt pay This Treacherie with thy Life. Ant. Vain Man; who ere thou art, know, the Life thou Threaten'st, is Guarded by too good a Sword. Carlos draws, and they all enter the Garden fighting. Henr. Make fast the door. To Carlos. Henr. Thou art some desperate Villain hir'd to murder. In the Garden. [Octavio and Diego come to the door. Ant. Hir'd by Friendship, and Honor's my Sallary. [A noise of fighting within. Oct. That's Antonio's voice within the Garden; Runs to the door and finds it shut. What! the door shut! my Friend engag'd, and I Excluded! cursed Fate! this Tree may help me To climb o're; if not, I'l flie t'him. Die. You may do so; your noble Love has Wings, He climbes up. And's ever Fledge; 'tis Molting time with mine; Yet I'l up too; the hazards not in climbing, Here I will sit, and out of dangers reach Expect the Issue. The Scene changes to a Garden, out of which they issue fighting. Oct. Courage, brave Friend; you have Octavio by you. Ant. So Seconded, a Coward would grow firm. Henr. What! is there more of your crue? then 'tis time To call for help; Ho! Sylvio, Geraldo, Pedro, come forth, and bring our Torches with you. Enter Sylvio with his Sword drawn. Sylv. Here am I, Sir; my Camerades will follow They fight. As soon as they have lighted their Torches. Ant. How I despise these Slaves Octavio, In the Tree. Having you by me! Die. Their Swords do clatter bravely in the dark. Sylv. I'm slain. [Sylvio falls. Die. Good; that's Sylvio's voice; I have ow'd that Fellow A Good-turn this Twelve-month for a Mistake, Breaking my Head, when he should have Broke a Jeast: Now he's paid. Henrique stepping back falls over Sylvio, and loses his Sword, and Carlos runs in to him. Car. What! are you hurt? Henr. No, onely I fell; Help me to find my Sword. Oct. What? d'you give back? you do well to take breath, The Rising Moon appears in the Scene. Whilst you have any left; 'twill not be long, Now that the Rising Moon lends us some light. [Porcia runs out to Octavio. Por. O Octavio! let not this moment slip To Free me from my cruel Brother's Fury, Or never hope to see me any more Amongst the living. [Octavio leads her away by the Arm. Oct. Ah! Noble Maid, he that is once possess'd Of such a Treasure, and safe-guards it not, Let him live Wretched, and Detested die; Where's my brave Friend? Ant. You have me by your side, lead off your Mistris, I'l secure your Retreat. In the Tree, pointing to those who are going off. [Exeunt Octavio, Porcia, and Antonio. Die. That doubtless is my Master, who victorious Is bravely marching off with his fair Prize; I'l down, and follow, inventing all the way Some handsome Lie t'excuse my Cowardice; Why liv'd not I five thousand years ago, Being ne'r made for this damn'd Iron Age? Diego comes down from the Treee, and follows Antonio. Car. But whilst my care led me to succour you, Having help'd up Henrique. Our Enemies, I fear, are got away; I heard the door open, and see none here, Although the Night's much brighter grown than 'twas; I'l follow, and trace the Villains if I can To their Dens; mean while take care of your Sister; And (pray) till my return be Moderate. Henr. How! Moderation in this case! what ho! Geraldo, Pedro, ah ye cursed Rogues, Enter Servants with Torches. Durst ye not shew your heads till they were gone? Geraldo, light me in, whilst Pedro looks To his hurt Companion; ah Porcia! Porcia! Exeunt Henrique and Geraldo; Pedro carries out Sylvio fainting with his hurts. The Scene Changes to the City of SEVIL. Enter Octavio, Porcia, Antonio, and a little after Diego, and after him Carlos. Die. Sure, that's Antonio bringing up the Rere; Pointing to Carlos. Sir, th'are but just before us; he bears her Most gallantly away; lose not sight of me. Car. This Fellow takes me for one of his Crew; He will by his mistake help me to harbour 'em. [Exeunt. [Camilla and Flora appear in the Balcone. The Scene changes to Don Henrique's House. Cam. Was there ever such a Disaster, Flora? Sure, th'are all dead, so great's the Silence. Flo. Madam, if mistake not very much, I heard your Brother's voice amongst 'em. Cam. Ah! my dear Brother, how thy ill-plac'd Friendship Upon that Brutal Kinsman has abus'd Thy Goodness; though my Natural affection Moves me, Flora, to Pitty him in Danger, Yet my Concernment for my Cozin Porcia Does prevail at present; Porcia, Porcia; No body answers. Flo. Madam, let us go down into the Garden. Cam. Take heed of that; 'twere to involve my self In this unlucky Scandal; 'tis possible, Affrighted with the Scuffle, she's return'd Into her Quarter by the other door; They go down and enter upon the Stage. Let us hast thither. Flo. Oh! Madam, I see a Light, and Don Henrique Coming this way with his Sword drawn, what shall We do? They go behind the door. Cam. Peace; let us hide our selves behind the door, Till we discover his Intentions. Enter Henrique, and Geraldo with a Torch, and Pedro with a Light; Henrique and Geraldo their Swords drawn. Pedr. Sir, I have search'd all the Rooms of the House, And cannot find her. Henr. Base Infamous Woman; may be she's fled To th'Quarter order'd for Antonio. Pedr. That door is lock'd, his Servant has the Key. Henr. Ah this unworthy Woman! thus to rob A Brother of the Fruits of all his Care; And cast this Stain on th'Honor of our House; But if I ever get the Fugitive Within my reach, I'l Sacrifice her Blood To the Offended Spirits of my Ancestors. Flo. Madam, do you hear? Cam. I, and tremble, Flora. Henr. Call out for her Woman. Pedr. Flora, Flora. Enter Flora. Flo. My good Angel Guard me; what would you have Sir? Henr. Where's your Mistris, Hussy? Flo. She told me, Sir, 'bout half an hour since She would go down into the Garden. [Exit Flora. Henr. My Shame is certain; ah! the sad condition Of us Men of Honor! how unequally Our Crosses and our Comforts mingled are! Our Orphan Sisters are no sooner grown Above the Follies of their Childish Age; During which Season Custom does exact Our Watchful Caution over all their Actions; But they are Grafted on some Stranger Stock, Where they do change both their Aboads, and Names, Without Reflexion in the least Degree Of Gratitude, on those, who Pain'd themselves To Cultivate their Youths; or else become An Hourly Torture to us, whilst the best Continu'd in our Care do never cease To give the Fears at least of what I feel. O unjust Heavens! why suffer you that they, Who to our Joys of Life such Bubbles are, Should add such Weight unto our Griefs, and Care? Ah Porcia, Porcia! Enter Carlos. Car. Cozin, I'm much mistaken, or I have In very Little time made a Great Progress Towards your Revenge; I come from harbouring The Villains, who have done you this Affront. Cam. It imports to be attentive now. Henr. Oh, you revive me, may I but once enjoy The Pleasure of my Revenge, though the next Moment were the last Period of my Life, I should depart contented; are the Villains Within our reach? Car. Be patient, Sir, and I'l inform you fully; You were no sooner up, but I pursu'd Your flying Enemies, hoping the night Grown somewhat Lighter, would enable me (At a convenient distance) to discover The place of their Retreat; one of their Partie, Who was behind the rest, mistaking me For one of his Camerades, bad me come on; Saying his Master was but just before; That he had born his Mistris bravely off. We had not past above a Street or two, Before he stopt, and at the second House Beyond the Church in St. Iago's Street, He enter'd, and desir'd me to follow him; I making a stand, he grew suspicious, And from my Silence guessing his Mistake, He slipt into the House, and lock'd the door; I having well observ'd the Street and House, Return'd with speed to give you this account. Flo. Oh, Madam, this is Don Octavio's House; Without all doubt they've carri'd Porcia thither. Cam. Peace, Flora, and listen to the sequel. Hen. Come, Cozin; we loose time; call all my Servants; I will besiege the House; if they refuse To render; I will reduce that Theater Of my Shame to Ashes, and make their Fort Both Theirs and its own Sepulchre; There are Such Charms in Vengeance, that I do not wonder, It is reserv'd for him, who form'd the Thunder. Car. Have patience, Cozin, and consult your Reason; 'Twill soon convince you, how Unpracticable And Vain your Proposition is, t'attempt At this time of the night, within a City, A House so Guarded, That, indeed, would prove Very like Thunder, which the Clowd destroys Wherein 'twas form'd, producing onely Noise. What can the Issue be, but to Allarm The Town; expose your Person, and your Fortune To th'Rigour of the Law; publish your Shame; And frustrate your Revenge for ever? Henr. What! would you have me tarry till these Villains, Who have invaded my House; Affronted My Person; Murder'd my Servant; and Robb'd Me of a Sister; may evade my Vengeance? Car. No; fear not that; let me alone to find A certain way to hinder their escape; I'l instantly to the Corrigidors, And beg th'assistance of his Authority, To secure these Criminals for the present, That afterwards the Law may punish them. Henr. A fine Proposal! why, Cozin, can you think That I'l submit a Personal Injury Unto a tame Decision of the Law? And having been Affronted by the Sword, To pray the Aid of the Long Robe, and take An Advocate for Second? Car. Your Provocation's great, Resentment's just; But, Cozin, the Greater they, the More you stand In need of Moderation, and th'Advice Of such a Friend, as you have always found me; Nor can I e'r express it more than now, In freely telling you, you must not suffer Your Passion to Command in this Occasion; âPassion, which wheresoever it contends âTo Govern most, there most Destroys its Ends. Henr. Oh! how I hate your drie Moralitie! To treat a Friend with Sentences, that's raging In a Feaver; you may as well pretend To teach a Man to Sing his Part, that's stretch'd Upon a Rack; no, Sir, I'l sooner die, Than ere consent to publish my Disgrace, Before I have Reveng'd it. Car. 'Tis far from my intent; all my design Is onely how we may Conceal your Shame, Till we have got these Villains in our Power. Which can be brought about by no such means, As by demanding Justice against those, Who did assault your Person, and have slain Your Servant; a most plausible pretence. Will this content you? trust my Conduct Cozin; Is not my Interest the same with yours? Henr. Well, since it must be so, I pray make haste. Car. Doubt not my diligence; by this I'l prove Friendship has Fire, and Wings as well as Love. Hen. If you could Flie, you'd move with too much Leisure; Ah tedious Minutes which Revenge does measure! [Exit Carlos. Flo. Madam, y'have heard their mischievous design. Cam. Yes, Flora, out of question Porcia's there; And if they find her, she is lost for ever. Flo. I'le try to Hinder it, though I were sure To Perish in th'attempt; I am confident The House at present is in such confusion, I may run thither without being miss'd. Cam. 'Tis well thought on; in th'interim I'l retire To Porcia's Chamber. [Exeunt from behind the door. Enter Geraldo. Ger. Sir, Don Antonio is just now arriv'd. Henr. Ha! what's that you say Sirrha? Ger. That Don Antonio, Sir, your Brother-in-law Is without, walking i'th' Hall, and bad me Give you notice of it, shall he come in? Henr. Antonio arriv'd! O Heavens! this Circumstance Alone was wanting to complete my Shame. When he desires to See his Wife, shall I My self inform so generous a Person That she is Run away? where shall I find A Heart, a Tongue, a Voice, or Breath, or Face To utter this unparalleld Disgrace? Ger. What is your pleasure, Sir? Don Antonio May think it long. Henr. Wait on him in, but at the same time tell him You cannot find me; I will leave my House, And the discovery of my Shame to Fate; And any Censure rather undergo, Than be Relater of my own Disgrace; Till first I have my Honor's Ransom paid In the Vile Blood of that perfidious Maid. [Exit Henrique. Enter Antonio and Ernesto. Ant. My Friend and his fair Mistris safely lodg'd, And free from their Adventure; 'tis now fit To mind my own Engagement; But Ernesto, VVhat can the meaning be of this indecent Suffering me to remain without thus long Upon my first Arrival? come, let's go on Into the other Rooms. Ern. I swear, Sir, I'm amaz'd at this great change; 'Tis not above two hours, since I found here A numerous and well-order'd Family, In all appearance, now I see the Pages Boult out of the doors, then start back again Into their holes, like Rabbets in a Warren; The Maids lie peeping at the Garret windows, Like th'Upper Tire of Ordinance in a Ship; Ah looks disorder'd now; nor can I guess What may have caus'd so strange an alteration; But there I see the Servant you sent in. Enter Geraldo. Ant. Friend, where's your Master? Ger. I cannot tell, Sir. Ant. Where is his Sister? Ger. In truth I know not, Sir; we Men-servants Have little to do in the Ladies Quarters. [Exit. Geraldo. Ant. This looks but odly; are you sure Ernesto, Y have not misguided me to a wrong House? Ern. If you are certain that we are awake, Then I am certain this is the same House Wherein this afternoon I saw, and spoke with Don Henrique and your Bride; by the same Token There was a Lady with her in a Veil; And this very Room is the Ante-chamber To her Apartment. Ant. I should be finely serv'd, if after all This Negotiation, and a tedious Journey, My Pains and Patience should be cast away On some such wither'd Sybil for a Wife, Ernesto goes towards the door. As her own Brother is asham'd to show me. Ern. You'l soon be freed from that fear, Sir. Ant. How so? Ern. Because I see her in the Inner Room, Lying along upon her Couch, and Reading; Her face is turn'd the other way, but yet Her Shape, and Cloathes assure me it is she. Ant. Art sure 'tis she? Ern. There are not many like her. Ant. If thou be'st sure 'tis she, I'l venture in, Without her Brother's help to introduce me. Ern. She's coming this way, Sir. Camilla Enters Reading. Cam. Y'have reason, Dido, and 'tis well remarqu'd, âThe Woman, who suffers her self to Love, âOught likewise to prepare her self to Suffer; There was great Power in your Charms, Ãneas, T'enthrall a Ladies heart at first approach, And make such early and such deep Impressions, That nothing, but her death, could ere deface. Alas! poor Dido! Ant. What do I see; or do I waking dream? Antonio seeing her, stands as if amaz'd. Sure I am asleep; and 'tis a Vision Of her, who's always present to my Thought; VVho fearing my Revolt does now Appear To Prove and to Confirm my Constancy. When first I saw that Miracle, she seem'd An Apparition, here it must be one. Ern. What fit of Frenzy's this, Sir? why 'tis Porcia, A Lovely Living Woman, and your Bride. Ant. The Blessing is too mighty for my Faith. Ern. Faith! ne'r trouble your Faith in this occasion, Approach her boldly, Sir, and trust your Sense. Ant. As when we dream of some Transporting Pleasure, And finding that we Dream we fear to Wake, Lest Sense should rob us of our Fancie's Treasure, And our Delightful Vision from us take; Bless'd Apparition, so it fares with me. That very Angel does once more appear, To whose Divinity long since I rais'd An Altar in my Heart, where I have Offer'd The constant Sacrifice of Sighs and Vows. My eyes are open, yet I dare not trust 'em; Bliss above Faith must pass for an Illusion; If such it be, O let me sleep for ever Happily deceiv'd; but Celestial Maid, If this thy glorious Presence Real be, O let one word of Pitty raise my Soul From Visional Delights, and make me die With Solid Joy instead of Extasie. Ern. 'Slife! he's in one of his old Fits again; VVhy what d'you mean, Sir? 'tis Porcia her self. Cam. I am that Maid, who to your Virtue owes Her Honor then, and her Disquiet since; Yet in my Pain I cannot but be Pleas'd To find a Stronger Passion justifi'd By Obligation; I may avow the Fire, To which both Love and Gratitude conspire. Ant. Incomparable Creature! can it be? That having Suffer'd all, which mighty Love Did e'r inflict, I now should be repaid With fuller Joys, than Love could ever give; Fortune to make my Happiness complete, Has joyn'd her Power, and made me find a Bride In a Lost Mistris, but with this Allay, Of leaving me no Means my Faith to prove, Since Chance anticipates the Hopes of Love. Cam. (aside ... )The Servant's Error has misled the Master, He takes me too for Porcia, bless'd Mistake; Assist me now Artful Dissimulation; But how can that consist with so much Passion?( ... aside) 'Tis possible the Sense of my Distress'd Condition might dispose a Gentle heart To take Impressions then, which afterwards Time, and your Second Thoughts may have Destroy'd; But can a Constant Passion be produc'd From those Ideas Pitty introduc'd? Let your Tongue speak your Heart, for should y'abuse me, I shall in time discover the Deceit; You may I aint Fire, Antonio, but not Heat. Ant. Madamâ Cam. Hold; be not too Scrupulous, Antonio; Let me Believe it, though it be not True; For the chief Happiness, poor Maids receive, Is when our Selves we happily Deceive. Ant. If, since I first those Conquering Eyes beheld, You have not reign'd Unrival'd in my Heart; May you Despise me now you are my Own, Which is, I think, all Curses summ'd in one. But may your Servant, Madam, take the boldness To ask, if you have ever thought of him? Cam. A Love, so founded in a Noble Heart, Has need of no Remembrancer, Antonio; You know your self too well; those of your Trade Have skill to Hold, as well as to Invade. Ant. Fortune has lifted me to such a Height Of Happiness, that it may Turn my Brain, When I look down upon the rest o'th' world. VVhat have I now to wish but Moderation To Temper, and to Fix my Joys? Cam. I yield as little t'you, noble Antonio, In Happiness, as Affection, but still Porcia must do as may become your Bride, And Sister to Don Henrique, in whose absence A longer Conference must be excus'd. And so I take the freedom to withdraw. (aside ... )Should I have staid untill Don Henrique came, His presence would have marr'd my whole design.( ... aside) [Exit Camilla. Ant. Where Beauty and Discretion so combine, 'Tis Heaven, me-thinks, to find that Treasure mine. Enter Henrique. Henr. Sure Don Antonio, having long ere this Found out th'infamous Flight of my vile Sister, VVill be retir'd to meditate Revenge Upon us both: ah Curse! he is there still; I'l slip away; but, O Heavens! 'tis too late, He has perceiv'd me. Ant. How, Don Henrique! avoid your Friend? that's come So long a Journey t'embrace you, and cast Himself at the feet of your fair Sister? Henr. Noble Antonio, you may well imagine The trouble I am in, that you should find My House in such Disorder, so unfit The Honor to receive of such a Guest. Ant. 'Tis true, Don Henrique, I am much surpriz'd With what I find; I little did expect Your Sister Porcia should have beenâ Henr. Oh Heavens! I'm lost, he has discover'd all. Aside. 'Tis not, Antonio, in a Brothers power To make a Sister of a better Paste, Than Heaven has made her. Ant. In your case specially; for out of doubt, Heaven never made a more Accomplish'd Creature. Henr. What means the Man? Ant. I come just now from Entertaining her: Whose Wit, and Beauty so excell all those Of her fair Sex, whom I have ever known, That my Description of her would appear Rather Detraction, than a Just Report Of her Perfections. Henr. (aside ... )Certainly he mocks me; he never could Have chosen a worse Sufferer of Scorn; But I will yet contain my self awhile To see how far he'l drive it;( ... aside) Say you, Sir, That you have Seen, and Entertain'd my Sister? Ant. Yes, Don Henrique; and with such full Contentment, So rais'd above Expression, that I think The Pains, and Cares of all my former Life Rewarded with Excess, in the Delight Of those few Minutes of her Conversation; 'Tis true, that Satisfaction was abridg'd By her well-weigh'd Severity; to give me A greater Pleasure in the Contemplation Of her discreet Observance of the Rules Of Decency; not suffering me, though now Her Husband, any longer to enjoy So great a Happiness, you being absent. Aside. Henr. I am confounded; but I must dissemble My Astonishment, till I can unfold The Mysterie; She might have spar'd that Caution, But I suppose you'l easily Forgive An Error on the Better side. Ant. Sir, I have seen so much of her Perfections In that short Visit, I shall sooner doubt All Definitions in Morality, Than once suppose her capable of Error. Aside. Henr. This Exposition makes it more Obscure: I must get him away. Sir, is't not time I bring you to your Chamber? it is late, And I believe that you have need of Rest. Ant. I should accept your offer, were I not Oblig'd, as late as 'tis, to see a Friend Before I go to Bed. Henr. I'l wait on you, Sir, if you'l give me leave. Ant. I humbly thank you, Sir, but can't consent To give you so much trouble; I'l return Within an hour at farthest. Henr. When e'r you please; y'are wholly Master here. Aside. Ant. I never saw a man so Discompos'd, What e'r the matter is. Ernesto, I must make a step to see A Friend near hand; bid Sancho follow me; And stay you in my Chamber till I come. [Exeunt Antonio, Ernesto. Henrique waits on him to the door. Henr. Your Servant, Sir; this sudden Salley hence At this time of the night, and newly' arriv'd From a long Journey, does imbroil me more. But now I will not long be in Suspense; I'l to my Sister's Chamber. Enter Carlos as Henrique is going into Porcia's Chamber. Car. Ho Don Henrique, there is haste requir'd; all's Prepar'd, and if the Quarrie lodg'd shall prove Worthy of our own Swords, we may employ them; If not, the Sword of Justice shall revenge Our Injuries; for the Corrigidor Is ready with a Band of Serjeants. Henr. Speak softly; Don Antonio is arriv'd, And some of his may over-hear us. Carl. That's very unlucky, but does he know That Porcia's missing? Henr. I think not yet. Carl. Come, let's away; we have no time to lose. Henr. Pray stay awhile; I labour with a Doubt Will burst me if not clear'd before I go. Carl. What Cozin! will you loose an Opportunity Never to be recover'd? are you mad? Will you permit the Villains to escape, He pulls And laugh at us for ever? come away. [Exit Carlos him. Henr. Well, I must go; and let time make it out; âThe worst Estate of Human Life is Doubt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FOURTH ACT. The SCENE is DON OCTAVIOS's House. Enter Octavio angrily pushing Diego, and Porcia following. Oct. Villain, thou hast undone us, cursed Villain; Where was thy Soul, had Fear quite Banish'd it? And left thee not one grain of common Sense? Porc. Was there ever so fatal an Accident? Oct. Why, Traitor, did'st thou not let me know it, As soon as we were come into the House? Die. What would y' have done if ye had known it then? Oct. I would have fally'd out, and Kill'd the Rogue, In whose Power thou hast put it to Destroy us; Can it be doubted, but that long ere this He has acquainted Henrique where we are? From whose black Rage we must immediately Expect to encounter all the pernicious Effects of Malice, back'd by Seeming Justice; Curse on all Cowards! better far be serv'd By Fools, and Knaves: they make less dang'rous Faults. Die. Am I in fault, because I'm not a Cat? How could I tell i'th' dark whether that Rascal Was a Knight Errant, or a Recreant Knight? I thought him one of us, and true to Love; Were it not for such Accidents as these That mock Man's Fore-cast, sure the Destinies Had ne'r been plac'd amongst the Deities. Oct. Peace, cowardly Slave; having thus plaid the Rogue, Art thou Sententious grown? did I not Fear To Stain my Sword with such Base Blood, I'd let Thy Soul out with it at a thousand wounds. Aside. Die. VVhy then a thousand Thanks to my Base Blood For saving my Good Flesh. Oct. Pardon, my dearest Mistris, this Excess Of Passion in your presence. Por. What shall we do Octavio? we are lost For ever; if we should stay here, my Brother Will be upon us instantly. Alas! My own Life I value not Octavio, Where yours, my Better life, such hazard runs; But O my Honor! O my Innocence! Expos'd to Scandal; there's my deepest Sense. Oct. Though the Complexion of your Brother's Malice Resemble Hell, it is not Black enough To cast a Stain upon your Virgin Whiteness. As Contraries compar'd set off each other, The sister's Brightness will expose the Brother. Por. O my Octavio! he is still my Brother; But what do you resolve to do? Oct. I must resolve and suddenly, but what I swear I know not, there have been such Turns In my Misfortunes, they have made me giddy. Por. You must determine, time wastes Octavio. Oct. If I should lead you through the Streets, and meet Th'inquisitive Justice, I daring not T'avow my self upon the other score You know of, you might that way be in danger; We must not venture 't; To Diego. Run Rascal, and fetch A Chair immediately. Die. A pretty Errand at this time o'th' night; These Chair-men are exceedingly well natur'd, Th'are likely to obey a Servant's Orders After ten a clock. [Exit Diego. Oct. Ye Powers above, why do ye lay so great A Weight on Human Nature, and bestow Such an Unequal Force to bear our Loads? After a long pursute through all those Storms, Which Hell-bred Malice, or the Power of Fate Could ever raise, t'oppose a Noble Love; To be at length possess'd of the Rich Mine, Where Nature seem'd to have lodg'd all her Treasure; And in an instant have it ravish'd from me, Is too rude a Trial for my tir'd Patience To sustain; I cannot bear it. Por. My Sense of this Misfortune Equals yours, But yet I must conjure you to submit To Heavens Decrees; such Resignation 'Tis possible, their Justice may induce The mischief to divert, though ne'r so near. Oct. Ah Porcia to part with you! Por. Loose not your self with me, though we are forc'd To Separate, yet we are not Divorc'd. Oct. Whilst our Souls act by Organs of the Sense, 'Twixt Death and Parting there's no difference. Por. Consult your Reason, then you will comply; Making a Virtue of Necessity. Oct. Ah lovely Maid, 'twas not allow'd to Jove To hold at once his Reason, and his Love. Enter Diego. Die. The Chair is come, Sir, just as I expected. Oct. Where is it? Die. Even where it was; they are deeply engag'd At New Cut, and will not leave their Game, They swear, for all the Dons in Sevil. Oct. A curse upon these Rogues! I'l make 'em come, Or put some of 'em in a condition To be carri'd themselves. [Octavio runs out. Die. Madam, though I was never yet Unkind To my own Person, I am so much troubled At the Disquiet my Mistake has brought you, That could I do it conveniently, i'faith, I could even cudgel my self. Por. Away Buffon, is this a time for fooling? Enter Antonio and Sancho. Ant. Where is my noble Friend Octavio? Die. Did you not meet him at the door, Sir? Ant. No. Die. He went out just as you came in. Ant. Madam, I might have gone to Bed, but not Addresses himself to Porcia. To Rest, without returning to enquire Anew of Yours, and of my Friends Condition; And once more offer you my Service. Por. I take the boldness in Octavio's absence To return his with my most humble Thanks For your late generous Assistance of us, And for this new Addition to our Debt. Ant. Madam, though I have not the Happiness To be Known to you, yet my constant Friendship With Octavio is of an antient Date; And all Occasions where I may express The Fervour of it, are most welcome to me. Enter Flora in great haste. Flo. O MadamâI'm out of breath with running. Por. What Accident, Flora, brings you hither? Flo. A sad one, Madam, and requiring haste, To give you timely notice on't; Don Carlos, Assisted by the light o'th' Rising Moon, And by a Mistake of some of your Train, Has Trac'd you to this House, and in my hearing, Inform'd your Brother of the Place, and Manner Of your Retreat, who is now coming hither Accompani'd with the Corigidor, To seize on whomsoever shall be found Within these Walls, upon pretence of Murder. Por. O cruel Accident! Flo. Madam, make haste, get out at the back door; Or you will certainly be met withall. Por. How vile a Creature am I now become! For though in my own Innocence secure, As to my self, t'others I shall appear Some wicked Woman, that has sold her Honor To purchase Infamy. Flo. They'l instantly be here. Por. O that Octavio should just now be absent! But to expect till he return were madness. Ant. Y' have reason, Madam, and if you dare trust Your Person to the Conduct of a Stranger, Upon my Honor, Lady, I'l Secure you, Or Perish in th'Attempt. Por. Generous Sir, how shall a wretched Maid, Abandon'd by her Fate to the pursute Of an Inhumane Brother, e'r be able Either to Merit, or Requite your Favours? Ant. Madam, they're more than Paid in the Admission, And your Acceptance of them will transfer The Obligation, making me the Debtor. Por. To your Protection I resign my self, With equal Gratitude and Confidence. Ant. Come Madam, there is no time to be lost; Diego, find out your Master presently, And tell him, that the Danger not allowing Our Stay till his Return, I shall convey His Mistris safely to a Nunnerie. Por. And Flora, stay you here to bring me word, What he resolves to do in this our desp'rate Condition. [Exit Diego. Flo. Madam, I shall. Going out returns. Ant. But stay; I swear I'd like to have committed A foul Mistake; the Monastery Gates Will not be open'd at this time of Night, Without a strict Inquiry into the Cause; Besides, 'tis possible, that once Lodg'd there, She may be out of my Friends Power, or mine, Ever to get her thence if it be known. Lady, I have thought better on't; I shall Conduct you to my Brother-in-law's house; A Person of such Quality, and Honor, As is fit to engage in your Protection; And there my Wife may have the Happiness T'accompany you, and pay the Offices Due to your Virtue, and distress'd Condition: And going to a House that's so much mine, Make account, Madam, 'tis to your own Home. Sancho, stay you here to attend Octavio, Turning to Sancho. And guide him the next way to my Apartment; Here is the Key; I shall have little use on't, Having left Ernesto waiting for me there. One word more, Sancho; let Octavio know 'Tis my advice that he come in a Chair; He by that means may scape Examination, Should he be met with. Por. Flora, I pray do you continue here, And if by any accident Octavio Should hindred be from coming after us, Observe his Motions, and where he Fixes; Then return home; and I shall find some way Of sending to you to inform my self. Flo. I shall not fail t'observe your Orders, Madam. Ant. Madam, I'm ready to wait on you. Por. Ah cruel Brother! ah my dear Octavio! O how perverse, and rigorous is my Fate! Thus to torment me betwixt Love and Hate. [Exeunt Antonio, Porcia. San. 'Tis no small Compliment my Master makes Your Ladie, and her Gallant, at this time O'th' night to quit his Brother-in-laws, and leave So fair a Bride as Porcia all alone. Flo. What? is his Mistris's name Porcia too? San. Yes; and if she has but a fair a Hand-maid As your self, I shall soon forget my Damsel In the Low-countries. Flo. If your Low-country Damsels resemble us, You would not be put to't to forget first; But I believe that you are safe enough; I have not heard such Praises of their Wit, But that we may suppose they have good Memories. Enter Diego. Die. Is not my Master yet return'd? Flo. No. Die. Well; now have we an Honorable Cause To wear the Beadles Livery; faith, Flora, If your tender Sex had not been privileg'd From this harsh Discipline, how prettily Would the Beadles Crimson Lace show upon Thy white back. Flo. 'T won't do so well as on a darker ground; 'Twill suit much better with your Tawney hide. San. I pray, Camerade, is it the Mode in Sevil To be Whip'd for Company? Die. Oh! a well-bred Soldier will ne'r refuse Such a Civility to an old Friend; This is a new way of being a Second, To shew your Passive Courage. San. We Soldiers do not use to show our Backs. Die. Not to your Enemies; but, Sir, the Beadle Will prove your Friend, for your Blood being Heated With your long Journey, Breathing of a Vein Is very requisite. San. Would to Heaven that I were in the Camp again There we are never stript till we are dead. Enter Octavio, and the Chair-men appear at the door. To the Chair-men. Oct. Be sure you stir not thence till I return. Sirrha, where's Porcia? Die. She's fled away i'th' dark, with a Young man Of your acquaintance. Oct. Rascal, leave your fooling. Die. There's none i'th' case, Sir, 'tis the wisest thing She ever did, had she staid your return, She would have fall'n into those very Clutches, In which you will immediately be grip'd, Unless you make more haste: Flora is come With all possible speed, to let you know Th'are coming with the Justice to lay hold Of all within this House, upon pretence Of a most horrid Murder; be quick, Sir; And save yourself. She's safe in a Nunnerie; Conducted thither by Antonio; Where, poor Lady, she's dropping for you now More Beads, perhaps, than Tears. Oct. Peace Screetch-Owl; Fire consume that Tongue of thine. What saist thou Villain? in a Nunnerie? Porcia in a Nunnerie? O Heavens! nothing But this was wanting to make me Desperate; What hope's there left ever to get her thence, After such Accidents as these made Publique? An Flora, is it true that my dear Porcia Is gone into a Monastery? Flo. Once, Sir, 'twas so resolv'd, and Diego sent To give you notice on't; but afterwards He being gone, they chang'd their Resolutions: There's one can tell you moreâ Pointing to Sancho. San. My Master bad me stay to let you know He has convey'd her to his own Apartment, In his Brother-in-laws House, a person So eminent in Quality, and Credit, That the ingaging him in her, and your Protection, Sir, may much avail you both; Besides, she'l have the pleasure there of being Very well treated by my Master's Bride. There he'l expect you, Sir, and does advise Your coming in a Chair, to avoid Question In case of any Encounter. Flo. And my walking by, Sir, as an Attendant, Will pass you without scruple for a Lady. Oct. I'l take his counsel, he's a generous Friend, Come Chair-men, away. To Sancho. Pray, friend, do you guide us. Die. Up with your Burden Beasts, and fall forth-with To your Half-Trot. [Exeunt. The Chair is carri'd over the Stage, Diego, Sancho, and Flora follow. [A Noise within, Follow, follow, follow. Enter Carlos, the Corigidor, and Serjeants, pursuing Sancho, Flora, and Diego. Die. This is one of Don Cupid's pretty Jeasts. W' are struck upon a Shelf before we could Put out to Sea. Flo. Oh, we are undone Diego! Car. You find, Sir, my Conjectures not ill grounded. To the Corrigidor. Cor. What are you, Sirrha? Die. A Living Creature, very like a Man, Onely I want a Heart. Cor. Y'are pleasant, Sir, pray Heaven your mirth continue. Who is that Woman with the Veil? Die. Let her answer for her self, sh'has a Tongue, Set it but once a going, and she'l tell All that she knows, and more. Cor. Make her discover her face. [One of the Serjeants goes to lift up her Veil. Car. Hold Friend; Cozin, if it should be Porcia, 'Twere not fit to expose her here. Cor. 'Tis very well consider'd, go you to her, And speak to her in private. [Carlos goes towards Flora. Flo. 'Tis I Sir, Flora, who being commanded By my Ladyâ Carl. Speak softly prithee Flora, 'tis enough; I understand the rest, and pitty her; Bid her sit still i'th' Chair, I'l do my best To save her from the Fury of her Brother. Flo. (aside ... )He thinks 'tis Porcia there, a good Mistake, It may secure Octavio for the present From the hands of this rude Rabble; ( ... aside) To Octavio in the Chair. Sit still, They take you for my Mistris Sir, I'l follow The Chair, and have a watchful Eye on all Occasions, that may further your Escape. Car. We have found our wandring Nymph. Cor. Is it Porcia her self? Car. No, 'tis her Woman Flora following The Chair, wherein they were conveying her To some other place. Cor. We arriv'd luckily, had we but staid A moment longer, they had all been fled. Ser. Will you have us see, Sir, who's in the Chair? Cor. Forbear Fellow! To Carlos. Her own Folly's punishment Enough t' a Woman of her Quality, Without our adding that of Publique shame. Carl. 'Twas luckily thought on, when you oblig'd Don Henrique to expect us at your House; For had he come, and found his Sister thus, 'T had not been possible to have restrain'd His Passion from some great Extravagance. Cor. I could not think it fit to let him come; For one of such a Spirit could ne'r brook The sight of those had done him these Affronts, Without invading those strict Rules, which might Render his Life obnoxious to the Laws. 'Tis better that a business of this nature, (Chiefly 'twixt Persons of such Quality) Should rather be reduc'd by Mediation (If it be possible) to some fair Agreement, Than to a publique Trial by the Law, Or, which is worse, some Barbarous Revenge. Looking upon Diego. Carl. This Fellow (if I am not much mistaken) Is Don Octavio's Man. Cor. Who do you belong too, Friend? Die. To no body, Sir. Cor. Do not you serve? Die. Yes Sir, but my Master is not himself. Cor. Take his Sword from him Serjeant. The Serjeant goes to take away his Sword. Die. Diego disarm'd by any other hand Than by his own? know Friend, it is a Weapon Of such dire Execution, that I dare not Deliver it, but to the hands of Justice. The Corrigidor receives the Sword, and gives it to one of his Serjeants. Signior, pray call for it, when you come home, And hang't up in your Hall, then under-write, This is bold Diego's Sword; O may it be Ever from Rust, as 'tis from Slaughter free. Cor. Thou art a Fellow of a pleasant humour. Die. Signior, I never pain my self for Love, Or Fame, or Riches, nor do I pretend To that great subtilty of Sense to Feel Before I am Hurt, and for the most part I keep my self out of Harms way. Carl. The Definition of a Philosopher. Cor. Come, leave your fooling Sirrha, wher's your Master Die. I am afraid we are not to be parted. Cor. Whom do you mean? Die. My Master, my Self, and the Fool your Worship Mentions, for sure one that had any Wit, Would never serve a Lover Militant; He had better wait upon a Mountebank, And be run through the Body twice a week To recommend his Balsom. Cor. This Fellow's an Original. Die. But of so ill a hand, I am not worth The hanging up, Sir, in my Masters room, Amongst the worst of your Collection. Enter Serjeants with two Foot-men, and two Maid-servants. Serj. An't please your Worship, we have search'd the House, From th'Cellars to the Garrits, and these are all The living Cattel we can find. Cor. Friends take a special care of that same Varlet, And the Waiting-woman; we'l find a way To make them tell the Truth, I warrant you. Flo. O Diego! must we be Prisoners together? Die. Why, that's not so bad as the Bands of Wedlock, Flora. Cor. Come, let's away; but whither to convey herâ To her own House certainly were not fit, Because of her incensed Brother. Car. If you approve it, Cozin, I'l carry her To mine; for since we seek (if possible) The business to compose, she will be there With much more Decency, and Satisfaction, And less expos'd to Censure of the World, Being in a Kinsmans House, and having there My Sister to accompany her. Cor. This business cannot be in better hands, Than yours; and there I'l leave it, and bid you Good-night. As the Corrigidor goes out. Carl. Your Servant Cozin, I wish you well home. Cozin, you may be pleased to take your Serjeants Along with you; there are without two Servants Belonging to Don Henrique, they'l suffice To guard our Prisoners, and with far less notice. Cor. Come Serjeants, follow me. To the Footmen and Maids. Carl. Well, you may go about your business, Friends, I'l not be troubled with ye; I am glad We did not find Octavio here; though I Might unaffected Ignorance pretend, I would not bring him (though by chance) t'his End. [Exeunt Servants. San. Well, I am now sufficiently instructed, And since there is no notice taken of me, I'l fairly steal away, and give my Master Account of this Misfortune. [Exit Sancho. Carl. Take up the Chair, and follow me. [They take up the Chair. Die. A Lovely Dame they bear, 'tis true, she's something Hairie, but that's a sign of Strength. Carl. Make haste, I long to let Don Henrique know, That his lost Sister is by my dexterity Recovered, and I hope to find some means To calm his Furie, and to repossess My Cozin Porcia, and (if't be possible) Octavio of his good Graces. Come away. [The Chair is carri'd off. Die. How like an Ass he'l look, when op'ning the Shell, His Worship finds within so rough a Kernel. [Exeunt omnes. The Scene Changes to Don Antonio's Apartment in Don Henrique's House. Enter Antonio and Porcia. Ant. Madam, banish all your Fears, you are now Safe in this House; be pleas'd to remain here, Till I shall bring some Lights, and acquaint Porcia With th'Honor she receives in entertaining So fair a Guest. Por. Who is't you say you will advertise Sir? Ant. My Wife Porcia; have but a little patience; And she shall wait upon you. [Exit Antonio. Por. Is her name Porcia too? I pray Heaven send her A better Fate than her distressed Names-sake. O Octavio! O Love! how dear do you Cost me! where am I brought? what House is this? What with my Fears, and Darkness, I have lost All my measures; I can't so much as guess What Quarter of the Town it is w'are in, For to avoid th'Encounter of my Brother, And his Revengeful Train, we have been forc'd To make so many Turnings, I am Giddy. But thanks to Providence I have this comfort, That I am in a place out of his reach. Enter Antonio with two Lights, and sets them on the Table. Ant. Madam, my Wife will presently attend you. Pardon I pray my absence for a moment. [Exit Antonio. Por. Now I begin to hope my Sighes, and Tears, Have in some sort with the just Heavens prevail'd At length to free meâLooking about her. But what do I see! Am I awake, or is it an Illusion? Is not this my Brother's House? Is not this The Quarter joining to my own Apartment? There is no room for Doubt, and my Misfortunes Are always Certain; Miserable Creature, That I should be thus Bandi'd up and down From one Hazard t'another, greater still. Ah cruel Heavens! what have I ever done To deserve this lasting Persecution? But how came I here? brought by Octavio's friend, Upon whose Virtue I did so relie That I my Brothers Malice durst defie. Can he betray me? sure I am in a Dream. But if OctavioâO vile Suspition! Octavio false? no, Truth and He are one. 'Tis possible his Friend may guilty be; But to what end so base a Treacherie: And if Perfidious, how could he be his Friend. I am confounded with the various forms Of my Misfortunes, Heightned still the more, The less I can their Hidden Cause explore. This onely's evident, that I must flie Immediately this fatal place; But why Struggle I thus with Fate? since Go, or Stay, She weeps. Death seems alike to wait me every way. Enter Antonio and Camilla. Cam. I wonder much what Lady this can be Aside. Antonio mentions. Ant. Pardon, my dearest Mistris, the Liberty Which I so early take; but I presume Such is your Generous Tenderness to those, Whose sad Misfortunes, not their Faults, have driven Into Distress, that you will think your self Oblig'd to him, who gives you the occasion To exercise those Virtues which do Visit Others, but Reside with you; This fair Ladyâ But she will best relate her own sad Story; Whilst I seek out Don Henrique, and engage him Both to Protect and Serve her with his Credit. [Exit Antonio. Upon Camilla's approach Porcia takes the Handkerchief from her Eyes. She runs after Antonio. Cam. Ha! what's that I see? stay, stay Antonio. It is not fit Don Henrique,âbut he's gone, And we are lost for ever. Porc. O Heavens! is this Antonio, the same Man To whom I am Betroth'd? then my Destruction Is inevitable. Cam. Are you an Apparition? or are you Porcia her self? speak, that when y' have said it thrice I may not yet believe you. Por. You well may Doubt even what you See Camilla; Since my Disasters are so new, and strange, They sever Truth from Credibility. Cam. How is it possible you should be here? Por. I know not how, onely of this I'm sure, I have not long t'expect the dismal end Of my sad Tragedy; since 'tis evident The Person that hath led me to this Place, This fatal Place, is the abus'd Antonio; Who with my Cruel Brother has conspir'd To take away my wretched life, and chose This Scene as fittest for their Cruelty. And thus, strange Fate! (through ignorance betraid) I have Protection sought from the same Partie, Whom I have Injur'd, and have made my Husband Th'onely Confident of his own Affront: Who to accomplish his too just Revenge, As well upon my Family, as Person, Gives me up to be Murder'd by my Brother. So whilst I'm branded as a Faithless Bride, He'l be detested as a Parricide. Cam. Prodigious Accident! but wert thou blind Not to know thine own House unhappy Porcia? Por. Alas, how could I in so dark a Night, In such Confusion, and so full of Fear? Besides, he brought me in by the Back way, Through his own Quarter, where was neither Light, Nor any Creature of the Family. Cam. Although I cannot comprehend the steps Of this your strange Adventure, yet dear Cozin, Your case (as I conceive) is not so desperate. Por. âWe easily perswade our selves to hope âThe things we wish; but Cozin, my condition Will not admit Self-flattery, and what Can you propose to temper my Despair? Cam. Don't you remember, how this very Evening Antonio's Man finding me in your Quarter Without a Veil (you having put on mine) That he appli'd himself to me, and I By your command, your Person did assume? Por. Yes very well. Cam. The Master since has by the Man's Mistake Been happily led into the same Error, And I not disabus'd him yet, in hopes It might produce Advantage to us both. Por. Oh! he has spoken with my Brother since, Who sure has Undeceiv'd him long ere this. No, without doubt they having found themselves Affronted both, have both conspir'd my death. Cam. How Cozin can that be? if Don Antonio In your Protection has engag'd himself, And is Octavio's Friend. Por. Cozin, if you impartially reflect On the Affront which I have done Antonio, You will not wonder much if he recede From the scarce-troden Path of rigid Honor To meet with his Revenge; and to that end Proceeds thus cautelously, and does feign Not to know me, that he may disavow Both to Octavio, and to all the world, Th'Infamy of Betraying a poor Maid To loss of Life and Honor. Cam. Misfortunes make you rave; this vile Suspition Is inconsistent with Antonio's Fame: You may as well believe that Nature will Reverse the order of the whole Creation, As that Antonio, a Man, whose Soul Is of so strong, and perfect a Complexion, Should ere descend to such a slavish Sin. And if we had the leisure, I could give you Such reasons to convince you of your Error, That you would easily acknowledge it. Aside. Por. I had forgot her near Concernments for Antonio. Pardon and Pitty me Camilla; My mind is by Afflictions made so Weak, I'm ready to believe Impossibilities. Cam. I Pitty thee with all my heart; but Cozin, If Antonio not knowing you, nor your Relations, should chance to find your Brother, And him inform of what has pass'd, and that He has convey'd the distress'd Partie hither, He'l presently imagine it is you; And then (I fear) 'twill be impossible (Though he should interpose with all his power) To stop the Iorrent, or divert his Rage From breaking in, and executing on us That horrid Parricide, which (though too late) It may be he himself would execrate. Por. There's too much ground for what you fear Camilla: But if we could secure our selves this night, There were some hopes that we to morrow may Engage both Don Antonio, and your Brother To find out some Expedient to redeem me From this deplorable condition. Cam. Were you onely in pain for your Security This night, I know an easie Remedy For that. Por. Which way my Dearest? Cam. Why what does hinder us from making use (On this occasion) of the secret Door, By which (you know) you have so often past Into our House (upon more pleasing Errands?) By this we shall these Benefits obtain; Of Safety from your Brothers present Fury, And time to try if Carlos, and Antonio May be ingag'd to mediate in this Business. And I have cause to think you will not find Antonio so implacable, as you Imagine. Por. I conceive you Cozin; Fool that I was, To think a Heart once Conquer'd by your Eyes Should e'r become another Virgin's Prize. Enter Antonio. Ant. So late; a Guest in's House; that's come so far; On such a Business; and not yet come home? Aside. There's something in't I cannot comprehend. I cannot, Madam, yet find out your Brother, But sure 'twill not be long ere he return. Then I'l acquaint him with the Accident Has made his House this Ladie's Sanctuary. Por. (Aside) Here is a glympse of comfort, for I see He takes my Cozin for Don Henrique's Sister; O bless'd Mistake so luckily continu'd! Cam. I am by his permission Mistris here, And since that I am pleas'd Sir, 'tis enough, Without our troubling him with the Account Of her sad Story. Ant. Yes, Madam, as to th'Excuse, but 'twere fit He knew it too, that we might serve our selves Of his Credit in this Ladie's Protection. Enter Henrique. Henr. (aside ... )Though I did promise the Corrigidor Not to stir from his House, till his return, Yet I could not obtain it of my self; I'm so impatient to unfold the Riddle Of Don Antonio's seeing of my Sister, And entertaining her in her own Lodgings; I shall not now be long i'th' dark. ( ... aside) He sees her. O Heavens! 'Tis she her self, and Camilla with her: Were all my Servants mad, or all agreed T'abuse me, in affirming she was fled? But Don Carlos, was he mad too, to swear That he had trac'd her to an other House? Certainly I, or they must be Possess'd; Or some Inchantment reigns within these Walls. Ant. O here comes Don Henrique, I'l now acquaint him With your sad Story Madam. Cam. I fear we are undone. Ant. Don Henriqueâ Por. I'm dead if he proceed, but how to hinder himâ Ant. Here's a Lady with your Sister Porciaâ Henr. Yes, Sir, I see who 'tis. Ant. Since you know her Sir, you will the eas'lier Excuse my boldness. Henr. Boldness, in what Sir? Ant. To have been th'occasion of your finding her Here, with your Sister, at this time of night. Henr. Lord Sir, what do you mean? Ant. Truly there was a Necessity in it, Which will, I hope, excuse my Intercession With you in her behalf. Por. Now all comes out. Henr. I understand you Sir, she does desire To pass this night with Porcia, to assist her In ordering her Nuptial Ceremonies: Let her stay here a God's name. Por. (Aside) If he does not dissemble, my Condition Is not so desperate as I imagin'd. Ant. I hope you'l pardon this great Liberty; So early a Confidence will need it, Sir. Henr. 'Tis more than enough Sir, that you desire it, Th'Occasion too does justifie her stay. Ant. 'Tis most true Sir, the Occasion did inforce me Thus boldly to presume upon your Friendship. Henr. Ha' done for Heavens sake, is it a Novelty Think you for Porcia, and her Cozin-Germin To pass a Night together? Ant. Aside. Is she so near a Kinswoman of his? Strange Inadvertence in her not to tell me Her relation to him, when I nam'd him first. I'd made fine work on't had I told him all. Looking on the Ladies. Henr. She knows I owe her many a Good-turn Upon Octavio's score, and hope ere long To be able to repay her to the full. Por. Can he declare his mind in plainer terms? Cam. I cannot tell which of us two he means, But I begin to fear that he knows all. Henr. Since 'tis so late, pray give the Ladies leave To retire to their Chambers; Go in Sister. Ant. Aside. My Brothers Words, and his Behaviour Imply some Mystery; I must be silent Till I discover more. Por. Let us begone, w'are lost if we stay here; I'm confident he counterfeits this Calm To disguise his Revenge, until Antonio, And the rest of the House are gone to Bed. Cam. But we shall ne'r be able to get out Whilst they continue in the outward Rooms. Por. Yes, by the Garden-dore, but I'm afraid 'Tis shut. Cam. No; now I think on't, Flora went that way, And left it open. Por. Come, lett's be gone; I hope Heaven does ordain Ease by that Door which first let in my Pain. [Exeunt Porcia and Camilla. Ant. I'l onely make a step Sir, to my Lodging, And then return to you immediately. Henr. Pray give me leave to wait on you. Ant. I humbly thank you Sir, I know the way, And shall not stay above a Moment from you. Henr. Y'are Master here, Sir. Ant. I'l now go see whether my Servant Sancho Has brought Octavio to my Apartment, As I directed him. [Exit Antonio. Henr. Heavens! was there ever so strange a Mystery! Don Carlos he affirm'd that those we fought with Had convey'd Porcia away, and when I come To seek her in the House I find her missing, To second this, her Waiting woman Flora Tells me that she went down, about that time, Into th'Garden; Antonio, not long after, Affirms that he both saw, and entertain'd her In her own Apartment, where I now find her, And Camilla with her: What can this be? These sure are Riddles to pose an Oedipus; But if by my own Sense I am assur'd My Honor's safe, which was so much in doubt, What matter is it how 'tis brought about.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIFTH ACT. The SCENE is DON CARLOS's House. Enter Diego, Flora, and Geraldo accompanying the Chair, greaping as i' the dark. Ger. Dame Flora, and Signior Diego, go in there. And you my Friends, set down the Chair i'th' door; And when the Party's enter'd, pull it to; 'Twill lock of't self; that done, you may be gone: There's Mony for you; I'l go fetch a Candle. [Exit Geraldo. Diego, and Flora go in, and the Chair being set in the door, Octavio goes out into the room, the Chair-men clap to the door, and go away. Enter Octavio, Diego, Flora, at another door. Oct. What! put in all alone here i'the dark! Groaping as i'th' dark. And the door shut upon me! Diego, Flora. Die. Here am I Sir, and Flora too, unless My Sense of feeling fails me. Oct. I can't conjecture where we are; I durst not So much as peep out of the Chair, since Flora Gave me the warning; but where e'r I am, 'Tis better far than in the Serjeants hands. Flo. Though now i'th' dark, I know well where we are: I have too often walk'd the Streets, Octavio, From your House hither, upon Cupid's Errants, Not to know the back door of Carlos's Apartment; 'tis there I am sure w' are now. Oct. Curse on thee, Flora! had'st thou lost thy wits Not to let me know it sooner! think'st thou I should have tamely suffer'd them to bring me, Like a poor Bird shut in a Cage, t' a place, Where I must look for nothing but Destruction. Die. A Gypsie told me by my Palm long since, A sour-fac'd Damsel should be my destruction. Flo. Suspend a while your Apprehensions, Sir; You may escape before the Candles come; The door was wont to open on this side; If not, I have another way in store. [Octavio goes to the door. Striving to open the door. Oct. Flora, I cannot make the Lock go back. Ger. unlocks it on the other side, and coming in with a Candle, meets with Octavio, and starting back and stumbling lets the Candle fall, then running out again locks fast the door. Die. Nay then, i'faith, w'are fast; I heard him give The Key a double Turn. [Diego takes up the Candle. Here's a fair Trial for your Maiden breath, Flora blow 't in again, let's owe your Mouth More Light, than yet your Eyes could e'r impart. Flo. Light's cast away on such an Owl as you; But yet I'l trie. [Flora blows the Candle in. Die. Thanks, gentle Flora, to your Virgin Puff; 'Tis a Strong breath that can o're-come a Snuff. [Aside. But I had rather 't had been let alone: If I must needs be slain, unless it were Behind my back, I'd have it i' the dark; For I hate to be kill'd in my own presence. Oct. What must we do Flora? all my hope's in you. Flo. There is yet room for Hope; there's a Back-stairs Beyond that inner Chamber, that goes down Into the Garden, if the door be open, As certainly it is, the way is easie. Oct. Come, let's lose no time; prethee guide us Flora. [Exeunt. The Scene changes to Don Henrique's House. Enter Don Henrique. Henr. As well pleas'd as I am, to find my Honor Less Desperate than I thought, I cannot rest Till I have drawn from Porcia a Confession Of the whole Truth, before she goes to bed; She's in her Chamber now, unless by new Enchantments carried thence. As he is going towards Porcia's Chamber, Enter Carlos in haste. Carl. (aside ... )I can't imagine what should make Don Henrique Quit the Corrigidors till we return'd: One of his Servants tells me he's come home. O here he is; now shall I raise a storm Which (if we do not take a special care) Will scarce b' allaid without a showr of Blood; Yet I must venture't, since it so imports Our Friendship, and the Honor of our House.( ... aside) Happiness is a stranger to Mankind, And like to a Forc'd Motion, it is ever Strongest at the beginning, then Languishing With time, grows weary of our company; But to Misfortunes we so subject are, That like to Natural motion they prove still More Vigorous in their Progress. Henr. What means this Philosophical Preamble? Carl. You'l know too soon I fear. Henr. Don Carlos, I am now so well recover'd From all m' Inquietudes, that for the future I dare defie the Malice of my Stars To cause a new Relapse into Distemper. Carl. Cozin, I'm so surpriz'd with this great change, That my Confusion does suppress my Joy; But since y'are so much Master of your Passions, I'l spare my Ethicks, and proceed to give you In short the Narrative of our success; The Corrigidor (as we did expect Forward to serve you in th'Affair I mention'd) Was pleas'd to go along with me in person, With a strong Band of Serjeants, to the place, Where I attended by your Servants led him: Cozin, 'twas there; it wounds my heart to speak it; And I conjure you summon all your Patience: 'Twas there I foundâ Henr. Whom Cozin did you find? for since I'm sure You found not Porcia there; my Concernments In your Discoveries are very unlikely To discompose me. Carl. I would to Heaven we had not found her there. Henr. What's that you say, Cozin, my Sister there! Carl. Yes Sir, your Sister. Henr. My Sister! that's good i'faith: ha, ha, ha. Carl. Why do you laugh? is the Dishonor of Your Family become a Laughing Matter? This is a worse Extreme me-thinks than t'other. Henr. How can I choose but Laugh to see you Dream; Awake for Heavens sake; and recall your Senses; Porcia there said you? Carl. Yes Sir, Porcia I say; your Sister Porcia; And which is more, 'twas in Octavio's House. Henr. Why sure y'are not in earnest, Cozin. Carl. As sure as you're alive I found her there. Henr. Then you transport me, Sir, beyond all patience: Why Cozin, if she has been still at home, Antonio seen, and entertain'd her here, Accompani'd by Camilla; if even now I left them there within; Is't possible You should have found her in Octavio's House? To be here, and there too, at the same time, None sure but Janus with his double face Can e'r unfold this Mystery. Carl. Sir, let me advise you; Abuse not your self: I tell you positively I found her there: And by the same Token, her Waiting-woman Flora was there attending her. Henr. Flora! dear Cozin, do not still persist Thus to affirm impossibilities. Carl. Sure you are making some Experiment Upon my Temper, and would fain provoke My Patience to some such high Disorder, That I should ne'r hereafter have the face When you are in your Fits to play the Stoick. Henr. Cozin, I swear to you upon my Honor, 'Tis not above a quarter of an hour, Since I did speak with Porcia, and your Sister In that very Apartment, and am now Returning to them in my Sister's Chamber. Carl. And Sir, I swear to you upon my Honor, 'Tis not above a quarter of an hour, Since I left Porcia carried in a Chair From Don Octavio's House, your man Geraldo Conducting the Chair-men to mine, and follow'd By Flora, whilst I came to find you out T'acquaint you, Sir, with this unpleasing news: But fit for you to know as soon might be. Henr. This Question, Cozin, may be soon decided, Pray come along, her Chamber's not far off. Carl. And my House is but the next door, let's in. Henr. You'l quickly find your Error. Carl. And you'l as soon be Undeceiv'd; but stay, Here comes your Servant, whom I left to Guard her; He'l instantly convince you of the Truth. Enter Geraldo. Ger. O Sir! Henr. What brings you hither Geraldo? Ger. O Sir, I bring you such rare news, your Enemy, Your Enemy OctavioâI'm out of breath. Henr. What does the Varlet mean? Ger. Sir, I suppose Don Carlos has inform'd you That he left me to see your Sister Porcia, With Flora, and Diego Octavio's Man Safely convey'd t'his House. Carl. See now Don Henrique, who was i' the Right. Ger. I did as he commanded me, and put them All three into Don Carlos's Anti-chamber; Porcia in the same Chair which brought her thither; And for more safety made the door be lock'd; Whilst I went down in haste to fetch a Light. Henr. As sure as Death this Madness is Infectious; My Man is now in one of Carlos Fits. Ger. Returning with a Light a moment after, No sooner open'd I the door, but Heavens! Who should I see there standing just before me In the same place where I left Porcia, but Octavio, your Enemy Octavio. Hen. Here is some Witch-craft sure; what can this mean? Ger. Amaz'd at th'sight, I let the Candle fall; And clapt the door to; then I double-lock'd it, And brought away the Key. Carl. But how could he get in, if you be sure You lock'd the door, when you went out for Lights? Ger. I know not whether he was there before, Or got in after, but of this I'm sure, That there I have him now, and safe enough. Carl. I am sorry for it. [Aside. Henr. Let's not, Don Carlos, now perplex our selves With needless Circumstances, when? and how? Those Queries are too Flegmatick for me; If the Beast be i'th' Toil it is enough; Let us go seize upon him; he must die. Enter Antonio. Ant. Good Brother, what unhappy Man is he, Whom you so positively doom to death? I have a Sword to serve you in all occasions Worthy of you, and me. Henr. His intervening, Carlos, is unlucky, How shall we govern our selves towards him In this Affair? so unfit for his knowledge? Carl. (Aside) Antonio is a Man of shining Honor; But having such a share in this Affront, If once he know't, I am afraid he'l bring Fuel, not Water to Don Henrique's Fire. To Henrique Don Henrique, you must suddenly resolve What answer to return, he's not a Man To be put off with any slight Pretences; Nor yet to be engag'd in such an Action, As bears th'appearance rather of Cruelty, Than Honor, and you know, Antonio needs No fresh Occasions to support his Name; âWho Dangers seek, are indigent of Fame. Ant. Aside. I find my coming hath disorder'd them, There's somthing they would fain conceal from me; All here is discompos'd, what er's the matter. Carl. Perhaps 'twere better to suspend a while The Execution of your just Revenge: Time, and mature weighing of Circumstances, Never did harm in Actions of this Nature; Where one has still the Party in his Power. Henr. A Curse on your Tame Proposition Carlos! Carl. âHe, who the Rules of Temperance neglects, âFrom a Good Cause may produce Vile Effects. To Antonio. Henr. I doubt not of your kind Concurrence, Sir, In all the near Concernments of a Person Alli'd to you as I am; but Noble Brother, It were against the Laws of Hospitality, And Civil Prudence to engage a Guest (Newly arriv'd after so long a Journey) In an occasion, Sir, of Blood, and Hazard. Ant. If such be the occasion, I must then Acquaint you freely, that I wear a Sword, Which must not be excluded from your Service; I'm sure you are too Noble t'imploy yours In any Cause not justifi'd by Honor; But I confess there are Affronts so great, And heightned by such odious Circumstances, As do release us from the usual Forms Of Generous Revenge; and set us free To tak't on any Advantage. Henr. Though with Regret I see, Sir, I must yield To your excess of Generosity; This onely I shall say to satisfie Your just Reflections; that my Resentments Are grounded on Affronts of such a Nature, That as nothing but the Offender's Life Can e'r repair them, so as to the Forms Of taking that Revenge, they can't admit Of the least scruple. Ant. Honor's my Standard; and 'tis true, that I Had rather Fall, than Blush for Victory; But you are such a Judge of Honor's Laws, That 'twere Injurious to suspect your Cause. Allow me, Sir, th'honor to lead the way. Exit Antonio and Henrique. Carl. If Porcia be there too, (as I believe) 'Twill prove, I fear, a fatal Tragedy; But should she not be there; yet 'tis too much For such a Heart as mine, through Ignorance To have betraid a Gentleman, though Faulty, Into such Cruel hands; I must go with them; But so resolv'd, as in this Bloody strife I'l salve my Honor, or I'l lose my Life. [Exit Carlos. The Scene changes to Carlos's House. Enter Octavio, Diego, Flora with a Candle. Flo. O the unluckiness! I vow t'you Sir, I have scarce known that door e'r lock'd before. Oct. There's no Remedy Flora, I am now At the Mercy of my Enemies. Die. Having broken into another's Ground, 'Tis just i'faith, you should be put i'th Pound. Oct. The Tide of my ill Fate is swoln so high, 'Twill not admit encrease of Miserie; Since amongst all the Curses there is none So wounds the Spirit, as Privation. For 'tis not where we Lie, but whence we Fell, The Loss of Heaven's the greatest Pain in Hell; When I had sail'd the doubtful Course of Love, Had safely gain'd my Port, and far above My Hopes, the precious Treasure had secur'd, For which so many Storms I had endur'd; To be so soon from this great Blessing torn, That's hard to say, if 'twere first Dead, or Born, May doubtless seem such a transcendent Curse, That even the Fates themselves could do no worse; Yet this I bore with an erected face, Since Fortune, not my Fault caus'd my Disgrace; But now my Eyes unto the Earth are bent, Conscious of meriting this Punishment, For trusting a fond Maid's Officious Care, My Life, and Honor's taken in this Snare; And thus I perish on this unseen Shelf, Pursu'd by Fate, and False unto my self. He pulls out his Tablets. Flora, when I am dead, be sure that you These Tablets give to Porcia; there she'l find, That to th'Extremest Moment of my Life I constantly pursu'd those Noble Ways, Which might Deserve her, though I could not Have her. Give me the Candle. Octavio sets the Candle on a Table, and sits down as to write in his Tablets. Die. A double Curse upon all Love in earnest, All Constant Love; 'tis still accompani'd With strange Disasters; or else ends in that Which is the worst of all Disasters Marriage. Flo. Sure you could wish that every body living Had such a Soul of Quick-silver, as yours, That can fix no where. Die. Why 'twould not be the worse for you, dear Flora, You then might hope in time to have your Turn, As well as those, who have much better Faces. Flo. You, I presume Sir, would be one o'th' latest Which I should hear of, yet 'tis possible That one might see you, before you should be welcom. Die. She has Wit, and good Humor; excellent Ingredients to pass away the time; And I have kindness for her Person too, But that will end with Marriage, and possibly Her good Humor; for I have seldom known The Husband, and the Wife make any Musick, Though when asunder they can play their parts; Well, friend Diego, I advise you to Look Before you Leap, for if you should be Coupled To a Yoak instead of a Yoak-fellow, 'Tis likely you may wear it to your Grave. Yet, honest Diego, now I think on't better, Your Dancing, and your Vaulting days are done, Faith all your Pleasures are three Stories high, Th'are come up to your Mouth, for you are now For Ease, and Eating, th'onely Joys of Life, And there's no Cook, nor Drie-Nurse like a Wife. [Flora over-hears him. Flo. I could find Reasons too for Matrimony, A Stale Maid is a horrible reproach, I must confess it; and a Waiting-woman Does onely change a Mistris for a Master; I may quit her, 'tis true, but not my Husband, And on the other side she may quit me, And turn me off, when old, and good for nothing. A Husband's bound to keep me still; In fine, For ought I can perceive the Scales are Equal, I may throw Cross and Pile, which Life I'd have, The Single Begger, or the Marri'd Slave; But heark! the Door within, from whence we came Is newly open'd, or my Ears deceive me. Die. Methoughts I heard it too, let us peep in. [They look into the next Room, and start back. O Sir, w'are lost, I see two Female-Giants Runs to Octavio. Coming most terribly upon us. Oct. Away you troublesome Fool. Enter Camilla and Porcia, the one with a Key, the other with a Candle. Por. I'm confident no body saw us pass From th'other House. Cam. However, let's go through my Brother's Quarter, And open the Back-door into the Street; 'Tis good in all Events t'have a Retreat More ways, than one. A door claps behind, and both look back. Por. O Heavens! our surest is cut off, the Wind Has clapt that door to thorough which we came. Cam. The Accident's unlucky, 'tis a Spring-lock, That opens onely on the other side. Por. Let's on the faster, and make sure of th'other. Octavio here! Octavio hearing them starts up with the Tablets in's hand. Oct. Porcia in this place! may I trust my Senses, Or does my Fancy create these Chimeras? Die. Either we Sleep, and Dream extravagantly; Or else the Fairies govern in this House. [Flora runs to Porcia. Flo. Ah! dearest Mistris, you shall never make me Quit you so again. Por. But can that be Octavio? Oct. I was Octavio; but I am at present So much astonish'd, I am not my self. Cam. What can the meaning of this Vision be? [Octavio approaches Porcia. Oct. My dearest Porcia, how is't possible To find you in this place, noble Antonio Having so generously undertaken Your protection? Por. Did he not yours so too? and yet I find Octavio here, where he is more expos'd Than I, to sure destruction; I am loath To say 'tis he, who has Betraid us both. Oct. Antonio false? it is impossible. Die. It is too evident. Oct. Peace Slave; he is my Friend, of Noble Blood, Whose Fame's above the Level of those Tongues, That Bark by Custom at the brightest Virtues, As Dogs do at the Moon. Por. âHow hard it is for Virtue to suspect. Ah Octavio! we have been both deceiv'd; This vile Antonio is the very Man, To whom my Brother without my Consent, Or Knowledge has Contracted me in Flanders. Oct. Antonio the Man to whom y'are Contracted, Porcia the Bride whom he is come to Marry? Por. The very same. Oct. Why did you not acquaint me with it sooner? Por. Alas, I have not seen you since I knew it; But those Few hours such Wonders have produc'd, As surpass all Belief, and do require More time, than your unsafe Condition here Will allow us to make you understand it. Cam. Dear Friends, I cannot blame your Apprehensions, Nor your Suspition of Antonio's Friendship: But I am so possess'd with the Opinion Of his great Virtue, that I shall as soon Believe Impossibilities, as his Apostacie from Honour. Oct. What's her Concernment in Antonio, Porcia? Por. O, that's the strangest part of our sad Story; And which requires most time to tell you. A Blaze of Light appears at the Window, and a noise within. Por. See, Flora, at the Window, what's that Light, And Noise we hear. [Flora goes to the Window. Flo. O Madam! we are all undone, I see Henrique, Carlos, and their Servants with Torches All coming hither, and which is wonderful, Antonio leading them with his Sword drawn. Cam. Thou dream'st, distracted Wench; Antonio false? It is impossible. Camilla runs to the Window, and turning back says, All she has said is in appearance true, There's sure some hidden Mystery which thus Abuses us; for I shall ne'r believe Antonio can transgress the Rules of Friendship. Oct. Friendship's an Empty Name, made to Deceive Those, whose Good Nature tempts them to believe; There's no such thing on Earth, the best that we Can hope for here is faint Neutrality. Por. Ye Powers above! what pleasure can ye take To Persecute Submitting Innocence? Oct. Retire, dear Porcia, to that inner Room, For should thy cruel Brother find thee here, He's so revolted from Humanity, He'l mingle thine, with my Impurer Blood. Por. That were a kind of Contract; let him come; We'l meet at once Marriage, and Martyrdom. Oct. Soul of my Life retire. Por. I will not leave you. Oct. Thou preserv'st me by saving of thy self; For they can murder onely half of me, Whilst that my better part survives in thee. Por. I will die too, Octavio, to maintain, That different Causes form the same Effects; 'Tis Courage in you Men, Love in our Sex. [Octavio takes hold of her to lead her away. Oct. Help me Camilla. Cam. You must be rul'd, your Presence will increase Your Brother's Fury, and Octavio's Danger. Por. That Argument is Irresistible. They retire to the other Room, and Octavio waits on them to the door. Die. Nay if you are at that, the Devil take Taking Flora by the hand The hindmost; 'tis for your sake, dearest Flora, I shun these Honorable Occasions. Having no Weapon, Sir, 'tis fit that I As he goes out with Flora, turning to Octavio. March off with th'Baggage. [Exeunt Diego, Flora. Oct. I'm now upon the Frontiers of this Life, There's but one step to Immortality; And though my cruel fortune has allow'd me No other Witness of my Tragick end, But my Inhumane Murtherers; yet my Death Shall not Disgrace either my Life, or Love; To th'other World this Honor I will bear, That as I still have Liv'd, and Lov'd, so I Encounter Death with the same Constancy. Enter Antonio, Henrique, Carlos, and Geraldo, with their Swords drawn, Antonio before the rest. Ant. Where is the Man whose Insolence, and Folly Has thus misled him to Affront my Friend? Oct. Here is the Man thou seek'st, and he, whom thou So basely hast Betraid. [Octavio draws. Ant. Oh Heavens! what is't I see? it is Octavio My Friend. Oct. Not thy Friend, Antonio; but 'tis Octavio, Who by thy Perfidie has been betraid To this forlorn Condition; but vile Man, Thou now shalt pay thy Treachery with thy Life. [Octavio makes at Antonio. Ant. Hold Octavio; though thy Injurious Error May transport thee, it shall not me beyond The Bounds of Honor; Heaven knows I thought Of nothing less, than what I find, Octavio In this place. Henr. What pause is this, Antonio? all your Fervour In the Concernments of your Friend, reduc'd To a tame Parly with our Enimy? Do all the Promises, you have made to me, T'assist my just Revenge, conclude in this? Oct. Do all the Promises you have made to me, T'assist my Virtuous Love, conclude in this? Hen. Where is your wonted Bravery? where your Kindness To such a near Allie? Oct. Where is your former Honor? where your Firmness To such an antient Friend? Aside. Ant. What course shall my Distracted Honor steer Betwixt these equal, opposite Engagements? Henr. What, demur still? nay then I'l right my self. Henrique makes at Octavio, Antonio turns on Octavio's side. Ant. Wh'attaques Octavio must pass through me. Aside. Carl. I must lay hold on this Occasion. Good Cozin, I conjure you to restrain Your Passion for a while, there does lie hid Some Mystery in this, which once unfolded, May possibly produce the Means of making That Reconcilable, which now seems Desp'rate. Henr. Sweetly propos'd, Sir, an Accommodation? Think'st thou my Anger's like a Fire of Straw, Onely to Blaze, and then expire in Smoak? Think'st thou I can forget my Name, and Nation, And Barter for Revenge, when Honor Bleeds? His Life must pay this Insolence, or mine. [He makes at Octavio again, Antonio interposes. Ant. Mine must protect his, or else perish with him. Henr. Since neither Faith, nor Friendship can prevail, 'Tis time to trie what proof you are, Antonio, Against your own near Interest; Know, that Man, Whom you protect against my just Revenge, Has seconded his Insolence to me By foul Attempts upon my Sister's Honor; Your Porcia's Sir, if this will not enflame you. [Porcia endeavours to come out, Camilla holds her. Por. This Injury's beyond all Sufferance. Carl. To what excess of Folly does our Rage Aside. Transport us Men! this most Important Secret, Which Tortures could not have made him discover, He (onely to advance his blind Revenge) Has now unforc'd declared to that Person, From whom, of all men living, he ought most To have conceal'd it. Oct. How! I attempt your Sister's Honor Henrique? The Parent of your black Designs, the Devil, Did ne'r invent a more malicious Falshood; 'Tis true, that I have serv'd the Virtuous Porcia, With such Devotion, and such Spotless Love, That, though Unworthy, yet she has been pleas'd To recompence my Passion with Esteem: By which, she has so chain'd me to her Service, That here I vow either to Live her Prize, Or if I Die, to fall Loves Sacrifice. Ant. O Heavens! what's that I hear? thou blessed Angel Guardian of Honor, I do now implore Thy powerful assistance to preserve That Reputation, which I hitherto By Virtuous Actions have maintain'd unblemish'd; In vain, Don Henrique, you design to change My Resolutions; it must ne'r be said, That Passion made Antonio recede From the strict Rules of Honor; Sir, I tell you, Nothing can make me violate my first Engagement. Henr. Nay, then thou shalt Die too, Perfidious Man; Ho! Geraldo, Pedro, Leonido. Enter Geraldo, Pedro, Leonido, with their Swords drawn, and joyn with Henrique, Carlos interposes. Carl. For Heaven's sake, Cozin, draw not on your self The horrid Infamy of Assasinating Persons of Noble Blood by Servile Hands. Henr. Do you Defend them too? Kill 'em I say. Ant. Retire Octavio, I'l sustain their shock. Oct. Octavio retire? Ant. Trust me you must, they will surround us else; Through that narrow Passage they'l Assail us With less advantage. They retire fighting off the Stage: Henrique and his Men persuing them, and Carlos endeavouring to stop Don Henrique. Henr. What d'ye give back, ye Men of mighty Fame? Ant. Don Henrique, you shall quickly find 'tis Honor, Not Fear makes me retire. [Exeunt. Enter presently Antonio and Octavio at another door, which Antonio bolts. Ant. Now we shall have a breathing while at least Octavio, and time to look about us; Pray see yon other door be fast. Octavio steps to the door where they went out, and Henrique bounces at the door they came in at. Within. Henr. Geraldo, fetch an Iron Bar to force The door. [Camilla and Porcia peep out. Cam. Heaven has heard our Prayers; th'are both safe here. Por. Let's go to 'em Camilla. Cam. 'Tis better to stay here a while, and hearken What Resolution of themselves they take. [Antonio goes to both the doors to see if they be fast. Ant. So, tis now as I could wish. Oct. What do you mean, Generous Antonio? Ant. To Kill thee now my Self, having perform'd What Pre-engagement did exact from me In your Defence gainst Others; my Love now Requires its Dues, as Honor has had his; There's no Protection for you from my Sword, But in your Own, or in your frank renouncing All Claim to Porcia; She is so much mine, That none must Breath, and have the Vanity Of a Pretender to her whilst I Live. Oct. My Claims to Porcia I shall ne'r renounce, But still assert them by all noble ways: Yet, Sir, this hand shall never use a Sword (Without the last Compulsion) 'gainst that Man, Who has so much Oblig'd me; no Antonio, You are securely Guarded by the Favours, You have conferr'd upon me. Ant. Sir, let not your pretended Gratitude Enervate your Defence; 'tis not my custom To serve my Friends with Prospects of Return; I therefore, Sir, do freely here acquit you From all the Obligations, you are pleas'd To own from me. Oct. You may, Sir, if you please, forbear to add New Favours to my' account; but you can never Substract those, which are past; and till that Debt Be fully paid, I shall not dare t'appear I'th' Lists against so Generous a Creditor. Ant. Your Scruples are ill grounded; 'twas Octavio (My antient Friend) whom I design'd to Serve; Not that Disloyal Man, who has invaded My Honor, and my Love; â'Tis the Intent âCreates the Obligation, not th'Event. Oct. I call those Powers, who both Discern, and Punish, To witness for me, that I never knew You e'r pretended to Don Henrique's Sister, Before I came within these fatal Walls: This I declare, onely to clear my self From th'Imputation of Disloyalty, And to prevent the Progress of your Error. Ant. How can I think you should speak Truth to me, Who am a Witness y'have been False to her, To whom, you now profess so high Devotion. Oct. I false to Porcia! take heed, Antonio, So foul an Injury provokes too much; But, Sir, I must confess I owe you more, Than the Forgivness of one gross Mistake. Ant. Rare Impudence! I must not trust my Senses. Oct. If we cannot adjust this Competition, Let us our Fortunes, not our Passions charge With this our breach of Friendship. Ant. Leave your Discourses, and Defend your self; Either immediately Renounce all Claims To Porcia; or this must speak the rest. Shaking his Sword. They fight. Oct. Nay, then, this must Reply. They without bounce at the door, as if they were breaking it open. Por. Why do I doubt? there is no means to save him From the present danger, but by another, Perhaps as great, but something more remote; I'l do't. Whilst they fight, Porcia breaks from Camilla, and unbolts the door, then runs back into her place. Enter Henrique, Carlos, Leonido, Geraldo, with their Swords drawn. Hen. What's this! Antonio fighting with Octavio! This Bravery is excessive, Gallant Friend; Not to allow a share in your Revenge T'him, who's most concern'd; he must not die Without some Marks of mine. Henrique makes at Octavio, and Antonio turns to Octavio's side. Ant. Nay, then my Honor you invade anew, And by Assaulting him, Revive in me My Pre-engagements of Protecting him Against all others. Hen. Why were not you Antonio fighting with him? Were you not doing all you could to Kill him? Ant. Henrique, 'tis true; but finding in my breast An equal strife 'twixt Honor, and Revenge; I do in just compliance with them both Preserve him from your Rage, to Fall by mine. Carl. Brave Man, how Nicely he does Honor weigh! Justice her self holds not the Scales more Even. Henr. My Honor suffers more as yet than yours, And I must have my share in the Revenge; Either he must renounce all Claims to Porcia, Or Die immediately. Ant. It is agreed: that he must Doe, or Die: But by no other hand, than mine. Oct. Cease your Contention, and turn all your Swords Against this Breast; whilst Porcia' and I have breath, She must be mine, there's no Divorce but Death. Henr. I'l hear no more, protect him if thou canst Antonio. Kill the Slave, kill him, I say. Henrique makes at him, and Carlos endeavours to enterpose. Carl. For Heaven's sake hold a Moment; certainly There's some Mistake lies hidden here, which clear'd, Might hinder these Extremes. Henrique and his Servants press Antonio and Octavio. Cam. These Errors must be clear'd, before they grow Too fatal, but I fear your Brother's fury Will not admit of Reason. Por. I'm sure I'l try, though it should cost my life. Enter Porcia and Camilla from the Inner Room. Por. Don Henrique. Cam. Antonio, Carlos. Por. Octavio. Camilla and Porcia together. Hear us but speak. Henr. Ha! how came she here? Carl. Did not I tell you that she was brought hither By my Directions? you would not believe me. Henr. But how then could Octavio come hither? Carl. Nay, that Heaven knows; you heard as well as I Your Man's Relation. Henr. Ah thou vile Woman! that I could destroy Thy Memory with thy Life. Ant. Hold, Sir, that must not be. He offers to run at Porcia, Antonio interposes. Henr. What may not I do Justice upon her Neither? Ant. No Sir; although I have not yet the Honor To know who she 's, I have this night engag'd My self, both to Secure, and Serve her. Carl. He knows not Porcia; who was i' the right Don Henrique, You, or I? Henr. He not know Porcia? whom not an hour since I saw, and spoke with, entertaining her In his Apartment; sure we are Enchanted, And all we see's Illusion. Cam. Allow me, Henrique, to dispell these Charms; Who is't, Octavio, you pretend to? speak. Oct. You might have spar'd that Question; since none Knows so well as you, 'Tis Porcia I adore. Ant. Porcia's my Wife; Disloyal Man thou Di'st. Offers to make at Octavio. Cam. Hold Sir; which is the Porcia you claim too? Ant. Can you be'n doubt of that? you know too well The Conquest, that you made so long ago Of my surprized heart in Flanders. Carl. Conquest! Surpris'd! Flanders! what can this mean? Henr. New Riddles every moment do arise, And Mysteries are born of Mysteries. Cam. Thanks be to Heaven, our work draws near an end; Cozin, it belongs to you to finish it. Por. To free you from that Labyrinth, Antonio, In which a slight Mistake, not Rectifi'd, Has involv'd us all; know, th'suppos'd Porcia, Whom you so long have lov'd, 's the true Camilla. Cam. And you, Don Henrique, know, Octavio Has always been your Sister's faithful Lover; And onely Feign'd a Gallantry to me, His real Passion to Disguise from you. Ant. Octavio and Antonio run to one another and embrace. Generous Octavio. Oct. Brave Antonio, how happy are we both! Both in our Loves, and Friendships! Ant. Man's Joys do ne'r to their Perfection rise, Till when by Crosses heightned, they surprize. Cam. Camilla takes Antonio by the hand and leads him to Don Carlos. This, my dear Brother, is that brave Commander, To whom you owe your Life, and Liberty; And I much more, the safety of my Honor. Carl. Is this the Gallant Leader, who rescu'd us With so much Valour from th'Enemy's hands? Cam. The very same. Carl. If you knew him so well, why did not you Acquaint me with it sooner? 'twas a fault Camilla. Drawing Carlos aside. Cam. Alas, my dearest Brother, Gratitude Conspiring with the Graces of his Person, So soon possess'd him of my Heart, that I Despairing e'r again to see him; and Asham'd of such a Visionary Love, Durst never trust my Tongue with my own Thoughts. Carl. 'Tis enough. Don Carlos presents Camilla to Antonio. Take here from me the Hand of her, whose Heart Heaven, and your Merits have long since made yours Without my Knowledge; may her Virtue pay Some part of that, which we both owe to yours. Antonio takes Porcia's hand, and kisses it with great respect. Ant. Here with your leave, and hers I seal the Vows Of my Eternal Faith unto you both. Carl. But let's take heed, Antonio, lest whilst we Are Joying in our mutual Happiness, Don Henrique's scarcely yet compos'd Distemper Revive not, and Disorder us afresh: I like not his Grim Posture; you know well After a Tempest, though the Wind be laid, There often does remain for a good while A dangerous Agitation of the Waves; He must not yet be trusted with himself. Ant. 'Tis well thought on, let us go to him. Octavio holding Porcia by the hand advances towards Henrique. Oct. Here with Respect we wait the Confirmation Of Heaven's Decrees from your Indulgence, Sir. This Lady your Incomparable Sister, Can witness that I never did invade Your Passion for Camilla; and Pedro's death Happen'd by your mistaken Jealousie; The Causes of your Hate being now remov'd, 'Tis just, Don Henrique, the Effects should cease. Henr. I shall consult my Honor. Carl. You cannot take a better Counsellor In this Case, than you Own, and Sister's Honor; What, to secure them both, could have been wish'd Beyond what Fate hath of it self produc'd? Henr. âHow hard it is to Act upon Constraint. That, which I could have Wish'd, I now would Flie; Since 'tis obtruded by Necessity. Ant. Noble Don Henrique, make account of me To be as truly yours by this Alliance, As if a Brother's Name subsisted still. Aside. Henr. I must consent, I see, or worse will follow. âHe is a Fool who thinks by Force, or Skill âTo turn the Current of a Woman's Will. Since fair Camilla is Antonio's Lot, I Porcia yield to Don Antonios Friend. Our Strength, and Wisdom must submit to Fate. Stript of my Love, I will put off my Hate. Here, take her hand; and may she make you, Sir, Henrique takes Porcia by the hand and gives her to Octavio. Happier, than she has done me. Enter Diego and Flora from the inner Room. Flo. Had such Disorders e'r such a Come-off? Me-thinks 'twould make a Rare Plot for a Play. They all embrace, but Henrique coldly. Die. Faith Flora, I should have the worst of that; For by the Law of Comedy 'twould be My Lot to Marry you. Oct. Well thought on, Diego, though spoken in Jest; We cannot do, I think, a better thing In Earnest, than to make them Two Joyn Hands. What say'st thou to it, Flora? Flo. Indeed I have had so many Frights this night, That I am e'n afraid to lie alone. Die. Give me thy Hand Flora, it is a Bargain; Diego takes her by the hand. I promise thee, dear Spouse, I'l do my best To make thee first Repent this Earnest Jeast. Flo. That time shall trie. Carl. Since this last happy Scene is in my House, You'l make Collation with me ere we part. Ant., Oct. Agreed, agreed, agreed. Die. Sir, you had best make haste, else what you call Collation, may prove a Breakfast, for 'tis Near twelve a Clock. Ant. Thus end the Rare Adventures of Five Hours; As sometimes Boisterous Storms in Gentle Shouts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE. Diego comes stealing in, and is follow'd by Henrique, who stays at the Door, and Listens. Die. Come Gentlemen! Let the Dons, and Monsieurs say what they will; For our parts, we are for Old England still. Here's a fine Play indeed, to lay the Scene In three Houses of the same Town, O mean! Why we have several Plays, where I defie Th' Devil to tell where the Scene does lie: Sometimes in Greece, and then they make a step To Transilvania, thence at one Leap To Greece again: this shows a ranging Brain, Which scorns to be confin'd t' a Town in Spain. Then for the Plot; The possible Adventures of Five Hours; A copious Design, why' in some of ours Many of th'Adventures are impossible, Or if to be atchiev'd, no Man can tell Wit hin what time; this shows a rare Invention, When the Design's above your Comprehension: Whil'st here y'are treated with a Romance Tale, And a Plot cover'd with a Spanish Veil. As for the Style; It is as easie as a Proclamation, As if the Play were Pen'd for th'whole Nation. None of those thundring Lines, which use to crack Our Breaths, and set your Wits upon the Rack. Who can admire this Piece, or think it good; There's not one Line, but may be understood. The Raillerie; As innocent, as if't had past the Test Of a full Synod: not one Baudy Jeast; Nor any of those Words of Double Sense, Which makes th'Ladies, to show their Innocence; Look so demure; whil'st by a simp'ring Smile, The Gallant shows he understands the Style. But here you have a Piece so subtly Writ, Men must have Wit themselves to find the Wit: Faith that's too much; therefore by my consent, We'l Damn the Play. Pointing to the Pit. Henr. Think'st thou, Impertinent, That these, who know the Pangs of bringing forth A Living Scene, should e'r destroy this Birth. You ne'r can want such Writers, who aspire To please the Judges of that Upper Tire. The Knowing are his Peers, and for the rest Of the Illiterate Croud (though finely drest) The Author hopes, he never gave them cause To think, he'd waste his Time for their Applause. You then (most equal Judges) freely give Your Votes, whether this Play should Die, or Live.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE AT COURT W'have pass'd the Lords, and Commons; and At length, Dread Sir, to hear Your Final Door 'Tis true, Your Vassals, Sir, may Vote the Laws, Their Sanction comes from Your Divine Applause. This Shining Circle then will all sit Mute, Till one pronounce from you, Le Roy le Veut. FINIS.</field>
