      <field name="fulltext">The SCENE, CORINTH.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. A Garden belonging to a Palace. Enter Demetrius in Disguise, his Sword drawn, and Gomond following. Demet. Ye awful Powers, must I then bear this Villainy? Behold, my Love, the Fair, the chast Clorona, Barbarously murder'd thus, before my Face, [Raging. Yet leave her unreveng'd? Gomond. There is no Remedy. The Monster now, heading the Tyrant's Guards, Has sent for more, to back his Homicide: Whole Troops will straight be here; and now this Moment Some of his Creatures search through all the Rooms, Expecting vast Reward for taking Grimoald; The Name that you have given your Disguise: When you hold Council with the Ellien Party, Opprest by this fell Tyrant Aristander, If then, my Lord, instead of the false Grimoald, They find the true Demetrius; not you only, But we, the Cause, and all, are lost for ever. [Enter Pollidamus. Demet. My Eyeballs start, my Brain and Heart's on Fire, When I but thinkâOh execrable Dog! To bath his brutish Phangs in that fair Bosom, The Angels might mistake for Paradise, And miss no part of their expected Happiness; Death, and Confusion, I'll go back and kill him, In th'midst of all his Hellhounds! Pollid. Angels guard us!âWhat can this mean? Gomond. Delay but of one Minute. Sinks all your Friends into perpetual Ruin, And loses you irrevocablyâfor Heavens sake consider! And, gracious Prince, as ever wretched Corinth, And th'few of the old Strain were tender to ye, Recal your Patience; fly, and save your self. Demet. Oh bloody, murd'rous Villain!âOh, my Clorona! Gomond. The Princesses Apartment is the nearest Shelter at Hand, there you have Interest; Not a word more as you prize all our Lives. Demet. Give me Revenge, ye Powers,âor take this Trifle back; Blow off this Bubble, 'tis not worth my Care. [Exit. Pollid. Some strange Mischance, sure! what's the matter, Collonel? Why is the Prince thus hurried? Gomond. Whence come you, good my Lord, That you are ignorant of a dreadful Accident, Horrid enough to fright the Universe, And make all Nature's numerous Offspring tremble? Pollid. From a lone Grotto, where I have been reading Some Passages, in the calm Halcyon Days Of our Fore-fathers, e'er curst Tyranny Ruffled the Souls of great ones to a Storm: But say, what Accident of Note so dreadful Can fall o'th' suddain? I heard, indeed, that Damocles, The King's proud Favourite, has this Morning made th'Governor a Visit, His Frown I'm sure can't fright the great Timoleon; Much less the Universe. Gomond. Hear then, my Lord, What will fright you, and every Creature else, Whose Soul bears Sense of Honour, this great, proud Fiend you speak of, has kill'd the Governor's Daughter. Pollid. Hah, sure thy Brain's crack'd! what say'st thou, Gomond, kill'd her! Gomond. She's dead, my Lord, the beautiful Clorona; The Flower of Virgins, Pattern of true Virtue; And in a Word, her Sex's Masterpeice; In a curst Fret of Passion, by that Damocles, That Monster Damocles, barbarously butcher'd. Pollid. Immortal Gods, say how, for what? my Ears, methinks, Glow with Expectance of the dreadful Tale, And my Blood stagnates, frozen up with Wonder. Gomond. To tell the Story, from its cursed Source Would prove too tedious, therefore the main matter, Briefly, is thus: You long have known the Governor Once of Ãtolia, under great Demetrius; Our late, dread Royal Master, (till Antigonus, The conqu'ring Macedonian's Successor, Winning a glorious Battel where he fell, Set up his Son, this Tyrant Aristander,) Still kept to head the Elliensâwhose rough Numbers Have been but lately quell'd, nor do's Timoleon, Whose Heart is fix'd upon this Prince's Right; Spare yet t'incourage Parties, and in private To own this young Demetrius, who has the Name Of the old King, and nearest is related. Pollid. I know him of that Line, And also know that Aristander's Policy, Assisted by his Engine Damocles, Had in his Infancy resolv'd his Murder; Had not the Queen, now some Years since deceas'd, Exerting her Compassion one soft Minute, (A Virtue wonder'd at, since Wife to him;) Beg'd him her Page, and bred him with her Daughters. Gomond. But yet so strict, that the Offence is Mortal To name him of that Race, or own his Birthright; Himself forbid too to converse with Elliens Of any Rank, tho' here, at Lord Timoleon's Under Disguise, and by the Name of Grimoald, He often steals to meet the Malecontents; As now this Morning. Pollid. 'Tis whisper'd that the Tyrant's youngest Daughter Has such Esteem for him, 'tis grown to Passion, Tho' modest Governance keeps it in Bounds; She being, as fame reports, a Miracle, Considering whose Daughter, fair, wise and virtuous, Mild and Religiousâand by Consequence, Oft in Rebellion, with her vicious Father, But, for her Sister! Gomond. She is the reverse; Curst Aristander's own, his eldest born, First Grafting of his damn'd Impiety, And as her Face, by Nature, bears his Features, Her Soul too shares his Vices,âbut, nor this, (Who 'tis thought loves him too, tho' her Pride checks her) Nor t'other, tho' her Merits pleads so largely, E'er mov'd the Prince, Nature's chief Work: Clorona Engag'd him all; that sweet unhappy Virgin This instant massacred. Pollid. Give the rest Vent, and rid me of my Pain. Gomond. This fatal Morning, Just as the Prince had tender'd her his Vows, As was accustom'd, rushes in proud Damocles, With insolent Command from Aristander To my Lord Governor, to surrender up His Daughter to his Charge, to be a Wife To one that he had chose, and this so positively, That no Delay must be on pain of Death. Pollid. A Snare, by Hell, laid for Timoleon's Life! I smell it rank, they knowing he'd deny, And give the Tyrant thus fresh cause of Quarrel. Gomond. You may suppose, he that for fifty Years Had led his martial Troops to glorious Battel, Where his Command was like the Voice of Fate, As soon as giv'n obey'd, was now confounded At these unnatural Orders. Pollid. Was the Prince by too? Gomond. He was; altho' to Damocles unknown By his Disguise, but yet struck dumb as Death, As was the Governor for a while, till rouzing, As from a mortal Trance, his troubled Spirits, He answer'd, Aristander's Willâwas Law, And bid the haughty Lord accost Clorona, Since her Consent was necessary too, Who did, and here now comes the sad Catastrophe. Pollid. My Blood still bears an Ague. Gomond. This Heir of Hell, it seems, some time before, Had given her Notice of his brutal Love, Which, with Dislike, being answer'd, th'haughty Insolent Resolv'd to seize her by the Tyrant's Power; But with a Courage, wondrous in her Sex, Clinging about her Father, she defy'd him; Till, from that Guard he drag'd her with such Rudeness, That from her snowy Neck, the swelling Veins, As if enrag'd at such strange ruffain Violence, Spouted warm Gore in's Face, which as she saw, Still more resolv'd her, for with bitter Terms, Repeating the whole Mass of Infamy In his curst Master's, and his own vile Actions, She to the last abhor'd his amorous Passion, And with such feminine Inveteracy, That Damocles, flush'd with a Night's Debauch, Inflam'd too with Greek Wine, and Hell's worst Fury, And rais'd with her sharp words, to th'extream of Passion, His Dagger drawing, fix'd it in her Heart, Pollid. Before her Father's Face! Gomond. Before her Father's and her Lover's Face, Who straight, like Thunder, shot at Damocles, And with a Weapon, which he wore conceal'd, Had nail'd him to the Arras, had not th'Guards Quick interpos'd, two of which perish'd instantly, At the brave Prince's Foot; but the rest pressing, My self, and some the Houshold Crys brought in, Made shift to force him from them, and certain Ruin, Whilst I at last alone conducted him Out of the Crowd through a dark Passage hither; And what past more you saw. Polid. Ye heavenly Pow'rs! can ye view these Horrors! Yet idle keep your Vengeance!âBut, good Collonel, Where was the Governor's Lady, wise Belizaria? Soul of the Elliens, the brave Grecian Heroine, Whilst this inhuman Scene of Death was acting. Gomond. At her Devotion, e'er the dawn of Day, Amongst the sacred Priestesses of Bacchus, The Greeks fam'd Deity; paying grateful Thanks For the Recovery of her young Son Clindor, Late from a dangerous Sickness; the sole Gift Of Heaven, by her, to Lord Timoleon,âClorona Being by a former Choice. Pollid. Had the insulting Murderer nothing to say of her? Gomond. Yes, to conclude, he mutter'd, The Sting of the young Viper being blunted, There yet remain'd a Message from the King To th'Lady of the House, whom he would meet At her return from Prayers. Pollid. Mischief's old Strain, I'll lay my Life; 'twas hot some Years ago That Aristander courted her. Gomond. Most true; but for the Governor was still rejected Since when Love turns to Hate: But see, my Lord, The noble Heroine we are speaking of; Hah!âand that Devil Damocles; nay then This Interview must be of fatal Note: Let's stand aside and hear; when th'Prey is mark'd That Fiend has Claws to reach a Furlong off; I'll keep aloof from the fell Gripe. Pollid. And I. [They stand aside. Enter Damocles, Belizaria guarded, and Clindor. Damo. The Deed may seem too rash, but when th'Abuse Of my great Master, and my self's consider'd, The World must call it Justice; some tame Fool, Perhaps may say, 'twas but a Woman's Anger: Woman! whose only Weapon is the Tongue, And Men should laugh at it, a proper Argument; The Stings of Female Serpents are most dangerous, And should be trod out quickly lest they breed A Race too strong to quell; you therefore, Madam, [To Beliz. I have brought hither from that House of Clamour Where now I know Rebellion's forming Hydra's; Besides my Business to ye, from my Master, To give ye Council; and by the Example Late shewn, to have a Care to teach this Boy here More Loyalty and Manners than his Sister. Beliz. CÃ¦lestial Maid! of Heaven belov'd, Clorona, Who now amongst the Virgin Angels yonder, A new come Guest, receiv'st the joyful Welcomes Of all the Dwellers in that Court of Glory, Forgive me, since thou know'st I'm forc'd to bear The tainted Breath of thy vile Murderer; And since Revenge is not within my Power To put in Act, accept, sweet Saint, the Joy My Heart retains, to think thou shalt be crown'd With Happiness eternal, when this Wretch, Rebel to Heaven and Nature, stung with Pangs Of tortur'd Conscience, howls in Hell for ever. Damo. 'Tis well, 'tis wond'rous well; yet if that Title, That Rebel, had been spar'd by your Sagacity, And shar'd amongst your Politick Family, Methinks your Speech had been more natural. Beliz. Oh! no, it can suit none so well as thee; The petty Crimes are drawn in Minataure, Of those rebel against inferior Princes; But thou against the King of Kings mak'st Head, Break'st down his Fetice of Law and Divine Mandate, And shedding innocent Blood, with thee, is Justice, Which shews Rebellion in the largest Figures, Rank Disobedience against Heaven's Supremacy: Thou scorn'st to be so trivial an Offender To mutiny about Dispute of Titles, The Right, or Wrong, or Male-Administration Caus'd by Ambition, in this lower Orb; No, to a loftier Vice thy Pride do's swell, To Murder, the superior Crime in Hell, And equals that proud Fiend that did at first Rebel! Damo. Good still; well then, proud as you please to make me, As lawless and ungovern'd, yet you shall see, I have So calm a Temper to endure Revilings Bitter as these without return.âProceed, Nay now I urge you to't, say all you can, And in your worst of Thought describe my Character. Beliz. Thou darest not stand it, sure! Damo. Begin, and try me. Belz. So odious is the Theme, my trembling Tongue Faulters at th'Attempt; but since 'tis urg'd In part, 'tis thus: First then,âThat Form is horrible; Nature, in Pain, has given such frightful Airs Throughout thy Face, as if, instead of Union, She meant to scare the World from Amity. Thy Limbs too seem as if contriv'd in haste, When she was weary of her bungling Work, And sent 'em out, half finish'd, to the World: Then for thy Mind, 'twould craze a Stoick's Brain To think that Lewdness, Rapine, Cruelty, Pride, Rancor, Avarice, Envy, Detraction, Murd'rous Deceit, and loathsom Flattery, Join'd with the rest, as in Contempt of Providence, Should make the Popular Thing Men call a Favourite. There,âdo's the Picture please ye? Damo. Not extremely; I think I've seen it fairer drawn in Colours; But you'd have yours be thought no flatt'ring Pencil, Nor is it, I confess. Beliz. No, I'll be sworn I've drawn as near the Life as I'm able. Damo. Well, I'll take yours yet with a kinder Hand: Beauty is proper to exalt the Fancy; Your Forehead, like the Front of Venus fair; Your Eyes have Fire, that could kindle Nature Were it extinct, and new create the World. Your charming Breasts.âBut oh! where am I roving. Thus says the King.âNow then receive my Message: The King, my Master, wills ye to discard, And with a Heart, that wishes ye right well, All Malecontents, and cleave to his Protection: Your Husband is a weak misguided Dotard. Beliz. Audacious Upstart! Damo. Ruine is at his Heels, ready to crush him, And would, did not your Interest with the King Stave off the Blow; be wise then, and comply, Dress up your Beauty with an Air of Pleasure, And let great Aristander find ye grateful. Beliz. The Ancients, when they would depict a Devil, Still fashion'd him with monstrous Horns and Hoofs, To make his Form more terrible to Fancy: I had forgot that, when I drew thy Picture; For just as that to them, to me art thou: After this Speech, Thy Eyes are large as Bowls, Thy Mouth Breathes Fire that blasts; Hence horrid Spectre, But Praise be to CÃ¦lestial Providence, Thy Power can only fright, but not compel: No, hellish Tempter, let thy Master know, That the chaste Soul of Belizaria stands Still fix'd on its old Basis, sacred Virtue, Whence neither Gold nor Power can e'er remove it. Damo. Nay then, since offer'd Grace is so rejected, 'Tis dangerous to give the Liberty: Guards, take her, and confine her to a Chamber; And, on your Lives, let none, no not her Husband, Have Speech with her 'till the King's farther Order. The Boyâmay keep her CompanyâI think He's yet too young for Mischief. Beliz. His dear Prattle Will give me Joy amidst a thousand Sorrows. Come, Clindor, come, thou Darling of my Life, Comfort thy mourning Mother; and hereafter, When I've infus'd more Sentiments of Honour, Tell that bad Man her Soul's not like the Vulgar; But of that purer Essence which the Deities Gave to the Votaries they chose, and favour'd; So perfect, that should Fate and Hell conspire, The Gem is right, and it can stand the Fire. Damo. Oh! by all means, let's try it then.âAway there. [Exit Damoc. Belizaria guarded off, and Clin. Re-enter Pollidamus and Gomond. Gomon. No Sybil e'er could prophesy more right Than you, my Lord, you've guest the Source of all. Pollid. By all my hopes of Peace, a noble Lady, And worthy of all Honours; nor can Fame sound Too highly in her Praise. Oh, Fate! Oh, Heaven! Must then this sharp-fangl'd Wolf worry us all? No, we must muzzle him, perhaps his Master too: But hush a while,âsee where the sad Procession Appears in pompous Horror.âHeavens! this Spectacle Wou'd teach old Niobe to weep anew; Forgetting her own Woes, to mourn Clorona. Here Clorona appears laid upon a Bier all bloody, Timoleon following, bare-headed, with several Elliens, Spectators and Servants. Timol. Yet, yet, more Air; the Sorrows in my Heart Will burst my aged Trunk; give them more vent, That I may blow my Sighs around the Globe, And fill yon' Azure space with mournful Clamours, Ye mighty Powers, that dispose our Beings, And, as your choicest Blessings, give us Children. Me too, amongst the rest of thankful Parents, Who paid you daily Tribute of my Gratitude, May I not ask the Reason, without sinning, Why I'm thus robb'd? Why my Clorona lies, The darling Joy of an Indulgent Father? Like a sweet Flower crop'd from its Bed of Life; Wither'd, shrunk up, and pale? Oh my poor Girl! Where's now the Rosie Bloom upon those Cheeks That us'd to bless me at each Morning's Duty? Instead of taking mine, that sprightly Eye, Where like a Mirror I could Pride my self, And fancy the Meridian of my Age Was come again; all lost, all gone for ever! [Weeps. A Hell-born Ruffian steals my Heart's chief Treasure Even before my Face. Hah! old Timoleon, What wilt thou not revenge?âWhat say ye, Friends, Is the curs'd State of wretched Age so miserable We must look on, and bear these rueful Wrongs? Pollid. No, no, Lord Governor, should you want mortal Aid, The Gods themselves, to give us Proof they cannot Taint their Divinities by such an Action, But that it was the headlong work of Fate, Rash and precipitate, without their Order, Would range, in hostile manner, to revenge ye. Gomon. Look up, my Lord, and let your Griefs give place To brave Resolves of doing your self Justice: The Season's ripe, the Tyrant's Crimes full blown, And must be cropt; there's ne'er a Tongue in Corinth, Fix'd in the Head of any Man of Honour, But speaks my Sense; nor any weeping Eye, Curst with a sight of this [Clorona. heart-killing Object, But wou'd direct a Hand to wield a Sword To cut th'Inhuman Monsters from the Earth. 1 Ellien. Propose the way, my Lord, my Life is yours With Joy, so it revenge this injur'd Lady. 2 Ellien. And mine. 3 Ellien. The Lives of all here. Revenge, Revenge my Lord, and suddenly. Timol. Cover her Face, and now my Friends, I thank ye. Once more a throb of Nature: [To them. [Kisses her. Oh! Clorona! Good Friend, I do beseech ye to forgive me; [To Pollid. Tears are new Work with me, give me your Pardon, And only think what 'tis to be a Father. [Wipes his Eyes. So then, no more of that, [Looks sadly on her, then starts on the sudden. what yet agen a Look? Oh! thou white Liver'd meagre Traitor, Death, Thou now hast watch'd thy time to terrify me! How oft in foremost Ranks of bloody Battle, When, like a Field of Corn, mellow'd for Harvest, The Soldiers were in Clusters mow'd away, Have I, with my good Sword here clash'd thy Scyth, And dar'd thee to the Combat,âbut vain Boast, Since when I view (thee once so slighted) [Looking on Clorona. there, I start, and shake with Horror. [Shout and alarm within. Gomon. Something of Moment's acting in the Streets by this Alarm. Pollid. Go and see, good Gomond. Exit. Gomon. I am prevented, here comes one from Court, a Courtier certainly; I know him by his State Sneer, and his wrigling. Enter Cilon. Cilon. My Lord, I come t'inform ye from his Majesty, that having Knowledge of an Insurrection design'd amongst the People; and also of an Outrage, meant to Lord Damocles, for his doing Justice on your Rebellious Daughter, by some Elliens of your known Party; who, it seems, likewise oppos'd the Guards, of which are several kill'd, 'tis the King's Pleasure the Body shall be seiz'd, to be dispos'd of as becomes a Traitor. Your self, my Lord, he thinks fit, for the present, to banish into Ãtolia, amongst some Numbers more of the Confederacy; nor suffered even to take leave of your Wife, but to be gone within two Hours at farthest, on pain of Death. This is the Tenor of my Commission, my Lord.âGuards carry off the Body. Timol. Now hold, my Heart, and Brain keep firm thy Station; The Air grows hot, 'twill breed a Calenture: Furies and Hell!âMy dear Clorona hurry'd To be dispos'd of as becomes a Traitor; Perhaps her beauteous Body thrown to Dogs, Or by vile Hangman's Hands to be prophan'd, And dragg'd about the Streets.âHah! Patience avaunt, This is too rank; Death, [Draws and falls upon the Guards, who disarm him, and throw him down. once more I defie thee. Cilon. Secure the Governour, he is old,âhalf craz'd we may suppose too; we must bear with Frailty. You there that are his Friends take care of him, d'ye hear? And that you 'scape your selves, take as my Favour. [Exit Guards carrying off the Body. Pollid. Insolent Upstart! Come, Lord Governour, rise, Recal your manly Spirits to their Functions, And let us all join Hands to meet our Friends There in Ãtolia, for I'll thither too. Gomon. And I, where not a Day shall have an end, Wherein the longest Hours seem not too short, In Consultation of the Tyrant's Ruin, And the Destruction of that Villain Damocles. Pollid. The glorious Sun, each Morn, shall gild our Councils, And every God propitiously direct us; Clorona, from her heavenly Seat, shall take A pleasing View of each Design we make, And bless the Vengeance plotted for her sake. Timol. Up then, old Man, from thy repulsing Grave, [Rises up. Rest even disclaims thee, 'till thy Wrongs are righted; Rouze and pursue what glorious Honour dictates; Honour, Revenge, the Hero's bright twin Deities Court thee once more to settle thy Renown, And do a Deed shall gain eternal Laurels. 'Tis said, MedÃ¦a once, by Magick Skill, Her Father's aged Veins did with new Vigour fill. As his, by Art, mine shall by Nature be, And strong, as were her Charms, Clorona's Wrongs to me; Her to Revenge, behold me young again, My Blood ferments, fresh Heat warms ev'ry Vein, Courage and Anger fire my Heart and Brain; Monarchs Ambition, Statesmen Interest prize; And Lovers, doating on fair Lady's Eyes, Pursue Delight; but to a Soldier wrong'd, Revenge, a sweet Revenge is far above The Joys of Empire, Interest, or of Love. [Exeunt omnes. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. Enter Demetrius undisguis'd, and Amidea. Amid. Oh! Heaven, what's to be done! the Spies have sworn They saw this Grimoald enter my Apartment: My Sister's Agents too are searching narrowly Thro' all the Lodgings.âFie, my Lord Demetrius, How could you entertain such slight Regard For my true Friendship, to expose me thus? Demet. Call it not slight, adorable Divinity, Nor a Presumption on those milder Graces, That beautifie your Soul, and make ye heavenly; But that, in my Distress, as to a Sanctuary, I came for a Protection.âIf then, gracious Lady, My Habit be conceal'd, Grimoald is vanish'd, And must deceive all Spies; if you are pleas'd To think the worthless trifle of my Life Fit subject for a Secret, and forgive me. Amid. I have taken Care that your Disguise be safe From those that search; so much was due to Honour: If I had said to Love, it might be verify'd. [Aside. But you, my Lord, grow dangerous in your Politicks, And honest Friendship is scarce strong enough To stop the Current of a Daughter's Duty, From whence there might flow Safety to her Father. Demet. The Stream yet flows no farther than Suspicion: Thus, Madam, you can break no Bond of Duty, But in each Point are safe. Amid. Were the Case mine, Heaven knows, I could forgive ye, had your Dagger Been busy with the Inmate of my Breast, And made the little Bustler cease its Motion; Such small regard have I for the vain Follies Of this round Ball we breathe on, and so trifling Appear to me the State, the courted Pleasures On which the World do's place its chief Contentment. One thing, perhaps, worth living for, I value; But that, like Mysteries of Heaven to the Vulgar, Must be conceal'd,âunless a Blush reveal it. [Aside. Demet. May that, and every other Blessing, crown The beauteous Amidea. Amid. And tho' the sad Tale of Clorona's Death Exact extremest Justice and Revenge, Yet were it known that you are Grimoald, So fear'd and noted; and that I am privy To your close meeting of the Ellien Party, Against the King's Consent, and dread Command, What Ruin might not pour upon us both! Demet. I am school'd, fair Excellence, and will no more Ingage you in my Fate. Amid. Perhaps 'tis Treason You're plotting there, Treason against my Father? Is't fit his Daughter, then, should be your Confident? No, Prince, I charge ye, on your Life, no more: Thus far, since I've been bred up in your Councils, I'll keep the Secret; but if you relapse, Honour and Duty put it past my Power. Demet. Your Clemency's too great, and I'm asham'd Of this unmanner'd Trouble. Amid. No doubt, my Sister, E'er this, has told the King the whole past Matter; Believe then, 'tis a thing of Consequence T'evade her Malice, you well know her Humour; (Which has been late distasted with your Conduct) So should be on your Guard. Demet. I am so, Madam; And have a Turn of Wit too, ready at Hand, To throw Grimoald's late Action from Demetrius. Amid. That has been worth your Study.âHah! she's here. Enter Gilmunda. Stol'n in unknown too, pray Heaven she has not heard us. Gilmun. Alone, and in close Talk!âNay then 'tis plain There's Love betwixt 'em. Can then that purblind Wretch, That Figure of a Man, that senseless Statue, [Apart. Prefer that awkward, dull, Religious Face, With the pale Train of all her ghostly Features, Stiffen'd by formal Zeal, even to Ugliness, To my fresh Youth, and Flower of blooming Beauty; Nourish'd with Empire's Sweets, and pleas'd with Power? How I despise the Creature, and will turn All Liking to Abhorrence!âWhat, are ye startled? [To them. Some Plot then must be forming.âWhere's this Grimoald? This rank Arch-traitor, that dares seek Protection, Thus boldly, in your Highnesses Apartment? Amid. A Traitor seek Protection here! What mean ye? Gilm. Good ignorant Holiness, d'ye want the Meaning? Sure that grave Head, that has so long been poring On mouldy Authors, for Worm-eaten Morals, With such false Gems, dressing the Hypocrite, To pass on Ideots for Divinity, Must know the Definition of a Phrase So german to her Actions.âFor 'tis sworn The Traitor enter'd here. Amid. And freely might do so without my Knowledge. Gilm. Or has this close combining Another sort of Plot, call'd an Intrigue; In which this doughty Prince of airy Castles, Exerts his Love, in hopes the Times will turn, And Fate ordain your Saintship for a Queen? Is this the subject of your Privacy? Come, Sir, the Truth, what think ye of the Lady? Demet. Tho' this odd manner of Examination With Reason, Madam, might excuse an Answer; Yet since you've nam'd the Princess in particular, And make Reflection on this Interview Of such strange Nature, I will speak the Truth; And tell ye I am sorry to see Beauty, Like yours, ruffled with unbecoming Anger; Which, in one meaner, might be counted Malice, As to my ThoughtsâThey're, as they ought, of both: The Princess is a Mint of Godlike Virtues, Where new bright Graces every Day are coin'd, To bless all those about her: And for you, Madam, You can be what you please, there's enough in ye To furnish out a compleat Excellence, You are a Royal Virgin. Gilm. Royal Virgin! Is that all?âBy my Soul's best Joy, Ambition, This is a rank Abuseâa pointed Satyr: Instead of praising Female Rights of Conquest, Of wounding Hearts, of charming to an Ecstasy, And gaining Trophies by victorious Beauty, He tells me, with sly Malice, I'm a Virgin: Virgin!âthe Title of a Village Milkmaid. Amid. Between the stormy Gulphs, Love and Ambition, How her proud Soul is tortur'd! Gilm. Well, witty Sir, your Jest is understood: But your satyrick Vein so please your Highness, [Flourish within. Or Majesty, for that I know you dream on, Will be of use to entertain my Father, Whom I hear coming, and divert this Grimoald Out of his Mind; so speed ye both, you're sure of my Assistance. Enter Aristander, Damocles, Cilon, and Guards. Arist. Can there be Truth in what I hear, of Traitors Sheltring their infamous abandon'd Heads Here in this Cell of vile Hypocrisy? If I did think 'twere so, degenerate Brat; But why not think? What else can be the Fruit Of all this canting Zeal, these ghostly Groanings; With the long Bedroll of Fanatick Cheats, But Mischief, Treason, rank rebellious Villainy? Furies and Fire, how else is this? From whence? Where didst thou learn this wretched Trade of Bigotry? I'm sure, not from thy Father. Damo. All your Actions Pursuing Methods of Imperial Greatness And Glory, still have prov'd your Soul too noble For such low Traffick. Arist. Now, by my Crown and Dignity, But that I will not question my Experience, I should believe thy Mother plaid me false; And that some bigot Priest fluster'd with Wine, And gorg'd with the Reversions of the Temple, Stol'n from some high luxurious Sacrifice, Begot thee in the Crisis of his Rhapsody. Amid. Good Sir, I do beseech ye not to blame me, Because my Actions, full of Innocence, Tend towards Piety. Piety, Royal Sir, Is the blest Guide of Duty, and however Malicious Vice may wrong me of your Favour, My Prayers are still devoted. Arist. D'ye hear?âHer Prayers! A Girl of Fifteen's Prayers are much material; Stuff, stuff, dissembling, nothing else, by Bacchus. She that has that one Gift of strain'd Devotion, Has twenty Mischiefs in her Head to vie with't: By the bright Lustre of our Rosie God, I think now 'tis affronting his Divinity, To teaze him for more Blessings than are voluntary. He, full of Indulgence, pressing the rich Grape At Ease, and in good Humour, smiles upon us, And doles his Blessings as he finds our Merit, Without the plague of our Impertinence, And why then must you pray? Gilm. 'Tis Imposition Upon his sacred Sense, and most ill Manners, As if we would appoint his Hours of hearing, And hop'd to flatter him into Compliance: Besides, in Zealots 'tis all Affectation, And, ten to one, the Fruits of rank Hypocrisy. Arist. Ah! my Darling, Let me embrace thee, thou art my own, I'm sure, [Embracing her. And shall enjoy the Sweets of Empire with me. But to the Point still, where's this Traytor Grimoald? That Villain, who for fear his Coward Treason Should be detected by our Bosom Damocles, The Ruffian made one desperate Push and fled. Demet. If ever Patience wou'd be prov'd a Virtue, Now let it shew its Force. [Aside. Cilon. But what's most noted So, please your Majesty, is that the Rebel Shou'd be dog'd hither to her Highness's side: There was a pretty Business. Arist. Nay, 'tis not much unlikely, he's some Retainer Her Highness has in Pay.âHah! is't so, Minion? Give me to know, and let him be produc'd; Or, by my Head, not all your windy Prayers, No, nor your Priestesses, those holy Conjurers, With all the Mysteries of their Incantation, And subtlest Juggling, shall evade my Fury. Amid. I am all yours, Sir; and as my primitive Being Proceeded from you, if you suspect my Duty I'm ready to surrender. [Weeps. Arist. Whining Hypocrite! There's now another Sign of Female Mischief, Those Tears, which would as plentifully fall Were but her Lap-Dog sick.âDamn'd, damn'd dissembling, Gods! from a weeping and a praying Woman, You that have Power, defend me. Gilm. Your Majesty Looks o'er the great Demetrius there, whose Knowledge May give, perhaps, most Light into the Business, Since he was there; [Apart. Dull Fool, neglect my Favours! I'll be reveng'd, tho' his Destruction follow. [Aside. Arist. Whatâhe! the grovelling Insect I have nourish'd From Infancy by my indulgent Smiles; 'tis impossible That he dares speak, or think, or look towards The rebel Elliens, against my known Command, Much less assist 'em; yet 'tis buzz'd, indeed, That some of the Rabble own him for a Prince, And talk of Lineage. Hah! young Sir, what say ye? Is this authentick? speak, you Prince of Poppets, What know you of this Traytor? on your Life the Truth. Demet. Sir, not thro' Fear, but from th'effect of Duty, I do confess I saw a Stranger enter; Who likewise seeing me, in a wild Hurry Convey'd himself as quickly thro' a Window Into the Garden, e'er I could have time To apprehend him, or to know his Crime. Arist. A natural Slowness upon this occasion Possest ye, Sir, I do not like th'Excuse; Therefore I would advise ye use your Diligence, Your utmost Care, to find this Grimoald, This Bugbear of the Herd, within three Days, Or else your Head pays Forfeit.âYour Head, great Prince, By Bacchus, I have sworn it. Demet. Mighty King, What lies within the reach of Human Power, Or Wit t'effect, shall be employ'd to take him. Be pleas'd, great Sir, to excuse Impossibilities. Arist. Impossibilities! nothing's impossible that I command, I'll hear no more, my Word, like Fate, ne'er alters; Your Headâor Grimoald's. Demet. Then the Gods assist me. [Exit Demetrius. Arist. Let 'em, with all my Heart, and much good do ye. Gilm. So, there's a Virgin Favour for ye, Sir. [Scornfully to Demetrius. Arist. You too;âget to your Closet, [To Amidea. try if Canting Can cure the Green Sickness.âHence with that Face, Pale as a Statue in an Abbey Chapel, I'll have another Hour for you. Amid. Let me have Life No longer than Obedience to my Father; I'll to the sacred Priestesses of Bacchus, And after solemn Sacrifice, invoke The Deity to pardon all Offences, And ever guard the King. [Exit Amidea. Arist. Thou, my Gilmunda, Joy of my Heart, and Pleasure of my Eyes, That with the Rosie Graces of thy Look Excell'st Aurora in her Morning Glory, Go to thy lov'd Diversion, Masques and Musick; Let thy pleas'd Fancy study for Delights, And take my Purse and Power to procure 'em. Cilon, go you and see if th'Order's executed, The new Tax on the Elliens about Grain; Strictly examine if it has been paid, To Morrow I've another Game to play. Cilon. Your Majesty shall find my Diligence swifter than Thought, and I assure ye very proud of the Honour. Damo. What other Game, if I may presume, Sir? Arist. Come hither, give me thy Ear. [They whisper. Gilm. So much for injur'd Beauty: I think his Head's at Stake, And nothing less can make me Satisfaction. My pious Sister, too, is gone to exercise Amongst the frantick Priestesses; poor Enthusiast, I'm resolv'd I'll follow in Contempt, And laugh at their mad Ceremonies.âWhat are the great More than the vulgar, but in the variety Of their Delights? Feast then, my Soul, in Luxury, And taste the Pleasure of unbounded Will; Since that vile Canker, Time, must spoil our Bloom, And Joys insipid in the Days to come, I'll take the present Moment whilst I may, And make best use of ev'ry happy Day. [Exit. Damo. Sir, I confess I cannot guess your Drift, Have you then order'd this strange Proclamation? Arist. 'Tis is done, and worded too as they desire. Damo. And great Pollidamus, you say, is sent. Arist. Sent from Ãtolia with a Suit to me This Morning, in the Name of all the banish'd. Damo. To grant safe Conduct for their Wives and Children. Arist. Their Effects too, this I have granted all, And publish'd it at ev'ry Market Place. Hah!âdost thou wonder? No matter, e'er the Night's pale Goddess yonder, Has 'twice adorn'd herself with borrow'd Brightness, Got from her Brother's Magazine of Lustre, There will some Changes happenâthings be done, Will make thee own thy Master's fruitful Brain Was wise in doing this; nay, tho' consenting To give this Liberty to their Wives and Families, May add to a rebellious Conspiracy, I hear are gathering yonder,âYet I have don't. Dam. Prosper ye, Sir, you'll give me leave to scratch, Bite my Nails, pore, or so, I cannot solve the Riddle. Re-enter Cilon. Cilon. Sir, your Majesty's Commands are executed, and I think usher'd by a new Comet; a Comet, and please ye, for here's something without, appears as rare at Court. Arist. What Comet mean'st thou? Cilon. Oh, a very wonderful one, Sir! to be plain then, Lord Pollidamus, Friend to the old Governour Timoleon, begs an Audience of your MajestyâHe, he, he, he. [Laughs ridiculously. Arist. Admit himâHe is welcome. Cilon. The Devil he is! [Aside] My Ear sure is defective; What, I beseech ye, Sir? Arist. I tell thee he is welcome, bring him to me. Cilon. The world turns round, but I am no Astrologer. [Exit. Cilon. Dam. Nor I, 'tis not a Courtier's Business; but go, prithee let's see this Meteor. Arist. Two of the greatest Gifts that Fate bestow'd, When first the human Soul was bless'd with Reason, Were Truth and Subtlety, who tho' of different kinds, Are jointly seated in the Heart of Man; Where each by turns mov'd by the Wheels of Knowledge, Perform their natural OfficesâOne of these Must now be manag'd,âPut a clowdy Look on, [To Damocles. And seem as if ye were sadâFurrow your Brow, As if soft Conscience, curbing stubborn Nature, Made ye uneasie; I've a reason for't. [Damocles stands apart as Melancholly. Enter Pollidamus with Cilon. Pollid. Health to your Majesty. Arist. Welcome PollidamusâI have given Orders About the late Request of those are banish'd, To have a Passport for their Wives and Children; 'Tis granted Lord, and that they may not find I am the Bugbear, counted by the Rabble, I've ratified the Grant by Proclamation, For them, and their EffectsâA free, safe Passage On the King's Word. Pollid. Upon my Knees, I thank ye, Sir. Arist. Oh, good Pollidamus, no Ceremony! Wise, honest Lord, why thou hast been a Stranger Of late, at Court, unlucky Misconstructions Have quite unhing'd us all, some Faults have been too, I must confess; well, Friend, they must be mended, We are all faulty. Pollid. 'Tis common to human Nature, Sir, And with a Joyâunwonted to my Heart; I must declare, I feel strange Satisfaction, To see your Majesty so well dispos'd: The Crowd would not believe this, as you say, Sir. Arist. Oh, no, with them, I know I am a Monster! With far more Horns and Heads, than e'er the Hydra; But let your Wisdom judge. [Embracing him. Pollid. Sir, for your Presence, You may be term'd Divine; I hope all answers, In Mind, as well as Body. Dam. This is no Court, This is no School of Complements; 'dsdeath, I'm gravel'd still, I thought the King had hated this old Fellow. [Aside. Arist. Methinks, I wish too, th'Father of the War, The great Timoleon better grafted to me, But some odd Mattersâ Pollid. Oh, his Daughters Wrong's, great Sir! Can never be so soon forgotten, To make that easy. Arist. I have thought upon't, Pollidamus, Who has already had strict Reprehension For the rash Deed, tho' 'twas his Loyalty; But Loyalty, my Lord, should still own Reason, Else Loyalty were Madness:âPray look on him, By deadly Melancholly still possest; He ever since has droop'd his lowring Brow, Drawn into Wrinkles by his lashing Conscience, Shew the true Lines of Sorrow. Dam. I shall run mad,âI cannot bear this. [Aside. Arist. He had never regain'd my Favour, Had he not shewn the Signs of true Repentance. Dam. Confusion!âThe King's dissecting me! Must I stand mute too?âAnd please your Majesty! [Offers to speak. Arist. My Lord, my Lord, there needs no more Confession, Be sorry, and be silent, I won't hear ye speak. Dam. Cunning, by Heaven I find it now,âOh, Fool! To hit the Mark no sooner. [Aside. Arist. Without doubt, Pollidamus, Th'old Governour has been stirring up his Friends; Hah, is't not so?âCome, prithee speak, good Lord, Be so plain with me, to relate the Truth; Why thou may'st be a means to cause a Parly, To explain Grievances, and make us Friends; Say then, what Force? Dam. Rare, rare, most artificial! [Aside. Pollid. Some Troops, 'tis said, indeed there are in Embrio, But none so dangerous. Arist. Yes, I shall be besieg'd,âI've had a Dream on't. Pollid. Oh, no, I hope not, Sir! If you are pleas'd to hold this gracious Temper, Reflecting on past Errorsâwith my old Faith; I beg leave to be free, Sir, this your kind Passport, Will so oblige the Ladies, that their Interest Will be like Balsam to the fest'ring Wounds Of the griev'd Elliens.âThen, Sir, your late Taxation, A little mitigated. Arist. Oh, the Tax on Grain! Of half in half; well, well, it shall be moderated; They shall be full of Bread, and full of Mirth, And we'll be Friends again; by this time the Edict Is out to their Desire, and tell old Lyon-heart, Timoleon, that the Grant's the Speedier, In Complement to the fam'd Grecian Heroine, His wise and virtuous Lady; so, Pollidamus, Good honest Lord, farewel. Pollid. Heavens bless your Majesty! [Exit. Pollidamus. Arist. In good time; so much for the Politician: Now to my self again.âWell, hast thou fathom'd? Thy Eye seem'd to dart through me, as if wond'ring At what I spoke; hast thou yet found the Meaning? Dam. I must confess, Sir, not of every Circumstance; Tho' I knew Fallacy was the main End. Arist. Hast thou found that,âwhen first I favour'd thee, 'Twas for thy Heart, my Damocles, not thy Head-piece; Thou art a forward, bold, quick, willing Fellow, To execute thy Master's Will, that's something; And then performing it without examining The Right, the Wrong, the Virtue, the Vice on't, Is admirable Service; a rare Quality! Fit for a Prince's Favourite,âGive me thy Hand. Know then, that whilst my Tongue carress'd this Rebel, With politick King-craft guilding o'er my Medicine, The Poison was most fatal underneath. Dam. But, Sir, this Passport to conduct the Ladies; Must it not greatly add to raise new Forces, And bring 'em to a Head? Arist. When they're there: But when is that to be?âOh, dull, dull Damocles! Can'st thou believe I meant 'em what I promis'd? No, Fool, as soon as e'er themselves and Carriages, For they have leave for all,âJewels and Treasure, Plate, and what would have been stow'd up in Holes, Cellers and Ovens, had I try'd to find it, Shall be upon the March; then shall my Guardsâ Dam. Seize on 'em all, and make a glorious Plunder; Oh, most divinely plotted! Arist. Ay, now thou hast it; Gold never fails to prune a Courtier's Wit, And form him for the Mischiefs of its Nature. Dam. Let me adore ye, Sir, as you are greater Than all in Power, so are ye too in Politicks. Arist. They'll have a glittering Shew, I make no doubt; And I'll command that no Degree nor Age Shall be distinguished, but all seiz'd and rifled; Which done, the Women shall be sent to Prison, To ponder there at Leisure. Dam. Ha, ha, ha, ha. The Matron too, St haughty Belizaria, Will now have time to curse her Insolence, In late refusing of your offer'd Grace; There, let her chew upon her boasted Honour, Or try if stubborn Virtue will prevail: Virtue that wretched thing, fit for a Goal; This sure will low'r her Pride.âOh, I'm transported At the mere though on't! Arist. I'll give Orders instantly; I'll make her sue to be receiv'd, and wait too, Till I'm at Leisure. Dam. 'Twill be double Joy, To make the proud imperious Beauty know, 'Tis Obligation,âwhen you condescend. Arist. Why are we here confirm'd Gods of the Earth, Unless our Wills have a commanding Right, To rule the subject Creature? Let dull Monarchs, Of frozen Climes, dispense with the Prerogative Kings should enjoy. I'll shew no such Example, But live SupremeâHe that do's otherwise, And the bright Circle, on base Terms receive, Is King at Will, and governs but by Leave; And, as the modern Satyrist denotes him, A marbled CÃ¦sar pinnion'd to a Throne, The People regnant, and the Monarch Stone.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. Enter Timoleon, and Pollidamus. Timol. Throw down your hissing Bolts, ye angry Powers, Upon my Head, since 'tis your dreadful Will, Let fall at once, and dash me to the Earth; For these dire Plagues, these starts of Indignation, Are more insufferableâ Pollid. Perfidious Tyrant! Tyrant's a Name too mild for such Barbarity, There should be one in Hell new form'd on purpose; Curse on my credulous and easy Folly! Are these the Fruits of all his flattering Smiles? Only to gain a hellish Opportunity For more and greater Mischiefs, Robbery, Murder? Oh, horrid! horrid! Timol. MurderâDamnation seize him! That has been ever known his darling Sin, His dear Twin-Brother, still incorporated In his curst Infancy, some Woolf was slain, From whom his bloody Nurse took the warm Gore, To smear her Breasts, and make him suck in Cruelty, With his first Nourishment: Must not then, ye Gods, Blood be for Blood repaid? Oh, Justice! Justice! Pollid. The dreadful Insolence too of frighting Ladies, Wounding and bruizing Children, butchering Servants, Then basely plundering all, is past Example. Timol. Why Lucifer has drawn him to the Lees Of Wickedness; the Fiend runs low in Villainy: From the first rank of Crimes, Murder, Oppression, Rapes, Incest, and unnumber'd Sacrileges, He now descends in curst Variety, To the poor, base, Mechanick Vice of Stealing! The Ruffian's Trade to satisfy his Riot, When Want has made him desperate. Enter Gomond. Pollid. Now, good Gomond, What's farther done? The worst we know already. Gomon. A little to allay that worst then, hear Something of Comfort. Timol. The Word sounds as strange As if it were Arabick.âWell, proceed; what Comfort? Is my Wife past her Fears and laid in Peace; Or my poor Boy, my sweet young tender Blossom, Pluckt up by some rude Gripe?âOh! execrable Dog! These are his Comforts. Gomon. No, brave Soldier, Fate has not been so cruel, your Wife and Son Are safe, tho' yet in some Disorder, being retir'd To Bacchus Temple, with the rest o'th' Ladies, T'avoid Imprisonment, threatned by the Tyrant; Whose Guards have made such an unmanly Havock 'Mongst all that did resist, Story can't parallel. Pollid. The helpless Women, stript of their very Ornaments, Carriages robb'd, and all their hoarded Treasure, Sav'd up for many Years, 'tis said, amounting T' a Mass of Wealthâ Gomon. All which that Devil Damocles Stood by to see dispos'd to the King's Use; Besides the common Plunder given the Soldiers For their good Service. Timol. Oh, Devil! Devil! these are his Comforts. Gomon. No, great Timoleon, These now shall feast your Ear; this matchless Villainy Have the Ãtolians so possest with Horror, Rage and Revenge, that throughout all the Country; Nay, through the utmost Bounds of wide Achaia They flock in Shoals to Arms, each Hour brings Numbers; So that with those good Troops already rais'd, Which are to watch the Sign from Prince Demetrius, Within the Walls; we shall, e'er Morn, be ready To form a powerful Siege. Pollid. The News was Yesterday, The Prince to be proscrib'd at three Days end, Unless he find out Grimoald. Gomon. 'Tis most true, the Riddle of himself to be that Traytor, Being yet unknown, tho' it must make Demetrius Extremely active to divert his Fate; Which under Covert of a Search for Grimoald, Still furthers our Affairs. Pollid. The new Ãtolian Governour's revolted too, And has to Day dispatch'd a Letter to him, T'encourage and assist all Enterprizes. Gomon. My Lord, I saw it; every thing besides, Methinks, looks well and lucky, and to lead us To certain Victory, dear General, We only want you there. Timol. Me! Saidst thou me? In such a Cause can any one be wanting That has a Soul, and the least Grain of Honour, Much less Timoleon? Oh! Gomond, thou hast nam'd A Word indeed so powerful, that Revenge, Revenge, with its Associate Victory; That were I dead, and shrouded up to lie In mouldring Dissolution, a Clod inanimate, Like Heavens first Fiat, wou'd anew create me; Dart thro' the porous Marble where I lay, Like bright Ãtherial Lightning force its way, And faster raise new Life, than could the old decay. Pollid. That was spoke like Timoleon. Timol. Time, that giv'st Hero's space for mighty Actions, And hast, I hope, assign'd me these last Minutes To crown my Days with Glory; shake my Sands, Oh! shake 'em slowly, that I may have leisure To finish this great Deed; then willingly I fall thy Victim, full of Years and Honour. Gomon. Ten thousand Soldiers fight in your Resolves, Sir, 'Mongst which we've some of the old hardy Kind, That trod your former Marches; Sun-burnt Faces, With valiant Hearts, and sinewy Arms to follow ye; That when their still lov'd General gave the Word, Tho' Fate it self stood to oppose, would conquer. Timol. Let us go on; Charge, charge then, I am ready; Within my Banner, by some curious Hand, The Figure of Clorona shall be painted, Dress'd in her Virgin white, an Angel Innocence Gracing her Look; and in her snowy Bosom A bloody Dagger, stuck by a black Fury, Grizly and baleful, representing Damocles, Wave in the Air to animate our Friends. Then sound the Trumpet, and begin the Sport. 'Tis done, 'tis done, methinks I see the Action; The Walls are mounted, and the Breach is made: Oh! fix me there, thou martial Deity, That lov'st a Soldier; and this Aristander, Once more within my reach, if then I lose him May I be lost with Infamy; not Jove's Bolts, Nor crooked Fulgor, with its darling Flames, Should guard him from me; Heaven nor Earth should save him; Not all the Powers Hell sent him for Supply, Nor all the Thunder bursting from the Sky. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Temple of Bacchus. Enter Demetrius with a Letter, and Zizimo. Demet. Abandon'd as I am, proscrib'd, disgrac'd, Yet do's this Letter from the Ãtolian Governor, In the Name of them, and all the banish'd Elliens, Give me some Hopes, tho' with extremest Danger. Danger! what's Danger, in a Case like mine? Nothing,âa Word,âno more. Zizimo. The Siege is laid, Sir, think on that to comfort ye. Demet. He writes me word they're ready for the Attack, Bids me prepare too, my Friends within here, against five in th'Morning, To kill all those that guard the Castle Postern, Where they will entrance wait to seize the Tyrant. Zizimo. And rout the Guards. Demet. By Heavens! 'tis nobly plotted, And will, I hope too, be as well perform'd. Away to your Post then, and remember Silence; Silence, good Captain. Zizimo. Doubt me not, my Lord. [Exit Zizimo. Demet. Oh! thou then, who within this sacred Place Receiv'st the Prayers of Votary's distrest, Propitious be, and grant us thy Assistance; That Corinth may again retrieve her Peace, And the Traytor, Grimoald, be found her Prince. But hold,âI fear my Feet intrude too rashly; This Corner of the sacred Dome is hallow'd, Where the Illustrious Bones of Kings and Peers, For many Ages past, mouldring in Rest, Possess their gloomy Habitations. 'Twas here, ah! some where here, the dear Remains Of my sweet Virgin Love were rudely cast By Villains Hands; guide me, some pitying Angel, To the dear Receptacle, that I may with Reverence, The truest Reverence, sprung from faithful Love, Invoke my Angel's Aid for her Demetrius. Ghost of Clorona ascends. Oh, ye Immortals, have ye heard me then! Am I on Earth, may I believe my Eyes? Oh! take not from me, thou CÃ¦lestial Figure, My Soul, that flutters between Fear and Joy, 'Till thou hast blest me with thy lov'd Commands. Behold the Creature of thy Will, thy Lover Charm'd to an Ecstasy at thy blest Sight, And crawling on the Verge of Life to hear thee. [In his Ecstasy drops the Letter. Ghost. Go on, oh Prince, favour'd of Heaven, go on; Let no Doubt shake thee, nor chill Fear molest; Thou art selected for the Restauration Of the Corinthian Liberty.âTyranny shall wane, And cruel Aristander shall be no more. From flow'ry Groves, where Sol's eternal Rays, With Light perpetual, gilds the Nights and Days: Where Heaven gives boundless Joys to recompense Those Virgin Souls that die with Innocence. I come to tell thee, Prince, th'Almighty Doom Ordains thy Rise, and the curst Tyrant's Fall In lowest Diss; where Lucifer in Chains Shackles the damn'd, that rage and yell in Horror! Where frozen Isicles dart through the Bowels Of gnashing Fiends, or Fire alternate melts The scalding Marrow, is a dreadful Cavern Replete with Serpents Newts, and odious Vermin: The spotted Toad here spits his yellow Venom Against the poys'nous Aspick.âHorrid Spectres Skimming about with piercing Shrieks and Groans, Sound o'er the baleful Place.âThis dire Abode, By Fate, is fix'd the Cell of Aristander: Thus cruel Pride, is by the Gods rewarded. This gives the curst Blasphemer too a Mirror Where he may view himself; on then, my Demetrius, Prepare to strike the Blow, revenge, and prosper: The Powers Divine assur'd Success will grant, And wrong'd Clorona prove thy Guardian Saint. [Descends. Demet. And guarded so, who can fail to conquer? Thou heavenly Messenger, that from the Depth Of low Despair, hast lifted me to Paradise, Doubt not but I'll go on; the light foot Roe Stretches not faster o'er the spacious Lawn Than I, to meet this joyful Opportunity. My eager Speed, fledg'd with the Wings of Joy, As swift shall Post as Time it self can fly. [Exit. Enter Amidea Reading. Amid. Sacred Devotion, that dost cleanse the Mind From the vile Dross of worldly Vanity, Clear our short-sighted Reason, and inspire The clouded Scene with thy CÃ¦lestial Fire, How excellent to me are all thy Graces? And, ah! how sweet is innate Satisfaction? Blest Souls above seraphick Joys may find, But nought below compares with Peace of Mind. What's here! Takes up the Letter. A Letter subscrib'd to Prince Demetrius! How my Heart pants! this may be worth perusing; Bu I'll retire and read it, for yonder, 'mongst the Priestesses, I see my Sister coming, and Heaven help 'em, The hapless Belizaria; and the rest, Fled here for Sanctuary. Oh! Aristander, I wish thou hadst my Heart. [Exit. Enter from the inner part of the Temple Belizaria, Clindor, Helmige, and other Ladies, with the Priestesses of Bacchus in their Ornaments, Gilmunda appearing with her Masques on the other side; the chief Priestess coming forward, speaks. Ch. P. Ye Gods of Greece, and above all, great Bacchus, To whom, for many hundred rowling Years, Our sacred Rites and mystick Ceremonies Have been address'd, protect, and be propitious To these thy Suppliants; punish too the impious, Who dare prophane thy Altar; shower quick Vengeance Upon their Heads, thy Votary implores thee. Helm. The holy Maid blushes with glowing Anger, The Agitations of her troubled Soul Blaze in her Eyes and Visage. Beliz. Oh! can'st thou blame her? Seest thou not yonder, where the Royal Insolent Appears, in Mockery of the solemn Mysteries? Helm. Yes, and behold it with confus'd Amazement. Heavens! Can that Figure of a perfect Angel, That beauteous Form, whose personal Divinity Has Charm enough to force CÃ¦lestial Favour, Be yet so black within, to incline, Fiend-like, To horrid Profanation? It confounds me! See, she moves this way, and will speak t'ye, Madam. Beliz. I am prepar'd. Gilm. Is it then possible my Eyes can grant me So rare a Sight as this? Great Belizaria, Cry'd up for Patroness of Virtue, Wisdom; By the Crowd nick-nam'd too, the fam'd Grecian Heroine, Seeking a Shelter here for base Rebellion, Amongst a Rout of Enthusiastick Bigots? Can that great Soul, then, condescend so low To seek for any Aid but from it self? This is most wonderful, since I know, Madam, Do what you please, your Deeds are glorious all, And wise, as ye held Counsel with the Gods, And fashion'd their Decrees. Beliz. No, not so wise; Virtue's a thing, indeed, of such plain, simple Nature, 'Tis suited by kind Heaven for all Capacities, And consequently mine; but sacred Wisdom Is a much richer Grace, a Gift peculiar; Which as but few possess, so few deserve. Gilm. Oh! you deserve it, without all Dispute; The Gods, when they contriv'd so rare a Cabinet, Could not do less than give the richest Jewel T'enclose therein. Beliz. One Jewel, I confess, There is enclos'd, of an uncommon Value; Which is, Contempt of vicious Dignity. I can despise a mighty Man in Office, Whose Life and Inclinations are deprav'd, Or acts unjustly.âAnd if I see a Lady, Nay, tho' as great as you, out-face her Modesty, And from the Rules of Virgin Decency Rove up to Libertine Extravagance, My Soul can from its little Eminence Look down, nay and contemn her. Gilm. You can, great Heroine? And from my Eminence of State, and Power too, I can look down upon your proud Humility; For there's an Insolence sometimes in Rags As blameful as in Robes of Gold and Purple. I've often seen a surly Beggar snarl Because he thought the Alms was giv'n too mean For his Desert, tho' in extremest Misery. This boasted Virtue truly is a Pride Fashion'd and gilded by Hypocrisy, Which equals even the worst of vain Extravagance. I revel and enjoy the World, am great, Plac'd high, and thus, perhaps, indulge my Flatterers You're humble, set your Face, give Alms, and pray, DissembleâAll to gain publick Applause. What Difference then betwixt my Pride and yours? Beliz. The Difference is in th'Actions plain Sincerity: My Ends are sacred, and the Good I do Aims not to be rewarded here below, But in a Place where Pity's remember'd. Gilm. And do ye never fear to miss your Aim, And after your Pains-taking lose your Labour? Beliz. Oh! no, the Records are for ever fixt, Set down by an eternal Register, Where can be no Neglect. Gilm. If the rank Hypocrite, Who kindles publick Feuds for private Ends; Or th'stubborn factious Kindler of Rebellion May live unpunish'd there, and hope Reward, You may be certain of uncommon Share. Beliz. Rather for Loyalty and Love of Honour; For unless doing Justice deserve Punishment, I have no Pang of Conscience. Gilm. Not ev'n for Treason? That petty Vice lies sunk in your deep Wisdom. Here's a rare Proof of Honour, Virtue, Conscience; A precious Guide for our Corinthian Dames; [In heat. Or is your Matronship grown mad o'th' sudden, Should Rebels have no Punishment? Beliz. Rebels, Madam! The Word do's need such a nice Explanation 'Tis hard to be defin'd; and you, alas, [Raising her Voice. That use 'em most by Rote, without true Judgment, Had better change it for a modish one, Relating to your Head-dress, or your Body: Study new Phrases that run glib at Court, Where Flatt'ry still do's eccho ye, tho' Nonsense: Where the vile, supple, cringing Parasite May take 'em like his Gold, all without weighing; And let no thought of the Rebels strain your Fancy: But if you needs will descant on the Word, To do it right, know, Madam, 'twas invented When Royal Villainy first plagu'd Mankind. Were there no Tyrants, there had ne'er been Rebels. Gilm. Oh! can your Pride mount now o'er your Sincerity? [Loudly to her. Calm Virtue, cross'd, I see, can turn to Thunder; My Breast is all on Fire, by awful Juno, Her Soul o'er-tops me so, I flag and faulter. [Fretting about. And have no Power of answering.âBut see my Father, He'll do me Right I'm sure. Enter Aristander, Damocles, and Guards. Arist. What! are we then besieg'd? (To Damocles. Damo. Yes, Sir, in Jest; Three or four Thousand hot brain'd Ideots, Led by Pollidamus and craz'd Timoleon, Bloated with their long Ease and Idleness, Are got before the Walls. Ha, ha, ha, ha. Arist. I'll send my Guards anon to whip 'em home; Their hoary Ring-leaders too shall upon Mules, Their Faces to their Tails, ride thro' the City, To divert those within.â Now, my Gilmunda, what antick Forms are these? [Pointing to the Priestesses. What's all this Pageantry? Hah! I gave Order that [Seeing Beliz. and the rest. those saucy Women should be Imprison'd, how comes this Neglect? Damo. In the great Hurry, Sir, they 'scap'd the Guards, And fled for Shelter hither. Gilm. These here, the Priestesses, The impertinent Teazers of our Rosie Deity, Are going to entertain ye with their Ceremonies. Please your Majesty to sit a while you'll be diverted. Arist. It shall be so, I'll borrow so much time from the Besiegers. Gilm. How, Sir, besieg'd, is't then so hot? Arist. Ha, ha, ha, ha.âCome, let us see these Ceremonies. Here follows the Entertainment of Singing and Dancing, which done, enter Cilon hastily. Arist. Extremely pleasant: Oh, the crack-brain'd Anticks, What Whimsies craze their Brains?âHow now, what bring'st thou? Cilon. Sir, your Majesty, if you're at Leisure, shall hear a pretty Business. Hee, hee, hee, hee; the Besiegers, it seems, are now about ten thousand; hee, hee, hee. The new Ãtolian Governor, I hear, heads 'em, and joins with old Timoleon, hee, hee, hee, hee. Fools, Rogues. Arist. Confusion seize him! he makes Head against me. He, by my Bounty rais'd. Come hither, Damocles. [Whisper. Gilm. If my Eyes guide me right, I think I see My Sister yonder, in that part o'th' Temple, Alone and musing, a Paper in her Hand too: Now we're besieg'dâperhaps 'tis some Intelligence; I'm resolv'd to know,âit may do Service. [Exit. Arist. Ten thousand wilful Villains are too many, [To Damocles. And tho' I fear 'em not, 'tis good Policy To be secure: Hire then some trusty Agent, With promise of a Bounty large and gracious, In a Disguise to steal out of the Town At the dead of Night, and post to King Craterus, Our Ally and Neighbour; write our Case, And require Succours. Damo. Sir, it shall be done, And Goddess Fortune, if thou'lt be ador'd, Retrieve thy Scandal, be no more inconstant. [Exit. Arist. Enquire you for Demetrius, let him be watch'd, [To Cilon. His dated time comes on; and take those Tatlers [To Officer. And stow 'em up in Prison, for their great Heroes That are besieging us, thence to relieve 'em. Beliz. Death is a Hero, whose Relief is sure; He's ours, and we will thank him with a Smile. Actions, like this, blest Innocence can do, When thou shalt start, and tremble at his View. Artist. Furies and Hell! away with that curst Adder, She stings thus far off. How now? what new Frenzy? What would your Ceremonial Holiness? [Chief Priestess approaches Aristander. Chief P. By sacred Bacchus, mystick Cybele, Apollo, Delia, the August Divinities, Each Morn ador'd within this holy Temple, I do conjure you cease this Cruelty, And give these pious Votaries their Freedom. Arist. Ha, ha, ha, ha, what said the Antick? [Fleering. Chief P. Be cautious, Aristander, how with Deeds, Impious like these, thou dost offend the Deities; Free 'em, in the Name of all the Gods, I charge thee. Arist. Hence, preaching Ideot, or I'll spurn thee from me; Away, I say. [Ladies carry'd off. Now, by my sacred self, Not all the Gods, did they stand by, should free 'em. Chief P. Then take the Curse which I by them pronounce, Thy Ruin, impious Prince, is near at hand, Thy Crown and Empire lost. Arist. Witch! impudent Traytress! [Drags her by the Hair. I'll spoil your prophesying; drag 'em hence, And give 'em each an hundred Blows with Staves; Then let 'em try agen to be prophetick. [Guards beat the Priestesses. The Fury lurks within 'em will be rouz'd, Inveteracy its high flown Rage extend, Curst Female Mischief adding to the Fiend. [Exit. Re-enter Gilmunda with the Letter, and Amidea. Gilm. And did you find it here? Amid. Here in the Temple, [Amidea weeping. Open as now, subscrib'd too to Demetrius; But oh! consider, when I had perus'd The curst Contents, how then I was surpriz'd! Gilm. Surpriz'd! she talks as if some petty News had reach'd us, Whilst I, convulsive, tremble at the Terrors Are here enclos'd.âA Plot to kill the King, And let in the Besiegers to destroy The Guards, my self, and all of us; Oh horrid! And you to find this,âthat wants Confirmation; You have been thought, long since, to favour th'Elliens, And own this suppos'd Prince, and now, perhaps, Some Fret of your Despair makes you betray him. Amid. Oh! wrest not impiously my loyal Meaning Such an unnatural way; reluctant Conscience Infus'd into my Soul a Father's Danger; And the strange Means, Heaven sent me to prevent it. Thus a strict Bond of Duty principally, As well as to preserve the rest of the Court, Divulg'd the Secret, else you ne'er had known it. Gilm. Rather a Fit of Enthusiastick Zeal Has forc'd it from ye; you would fain be sainted, And this you think will do't, else why was I To be an Ignorant; was a Sister's Safety So slightly to be valu'd? Amid. Honour and Conscience Engaging me an equal Friend to both, Produc'd the great Discovery; else such a Sister, Who calls the Good we do, the Acts of Phrenzy; And when her certain Ruin is contriv'd, Says her Reliever do's it from Despair, Little deserves the Grace of such a Secret That must destroy a Lover. Gilm. Destroy a Lover! Amid. That, amongst the rest; Secrets are Trifles in such times of Danger; Yes, I avow, forgive me, Modesty, If at this Juncture I transgress thy Laws, And blushing, own Demetrius for my Lover; Whose Life not all the Wealth of Earth or Sea, The Sweets of Empire, or the Rage of Power, Should have compell'd me thus to have expos'd But th'Safety of a Father. Gilm. Double Traytor! And since I find him so, my Rage is doubled; Which shall, e'er Morn, have ample Satisfaction: My Father's twine of Life so slightly hangs, That even methinks grim Atropos is ready; I'll haste, then and prevent her, and in stead Make her an Offering of his Enemy; For now Love to rankest Hate is grown, Much, for my Father's sake, but more my own. [Exit. Amid. Oh wretched Maid! how dreadful is thy Case, When thou art even oblig'd to curse thy Piety? [Weeps. Nor could it be a blest, but some ill Genius That working his dire Ends, prophan'd the Temple, And led me to the Secret. What have I done? Why sav'd a Father's Life, and sure that's good? What else? Why then I have to do this Good, Murder'd the Man I lov'd!âOh Horror! Horror! Can all the Joys that bless my filial Piety O'ercome the Woes my Soul must bear for this? Ah, no! Love has a nearer Tie than Nature, And pulls the Heart Strings stronger.âYet 'twas my Father! To see the Author of my Life extended Upon the Floor! a Dagger in his Heart, Which I consented to!âImpious and hateful! A Sin unpardonable!âBut then, Demetrius! Whose graceful Charms first caus'd my Virgin Heart To have a Sense of Love; who, by his Influence, Forming the Atoms that lay all confus'd And wild, first made me know I had a Soul To be, by my Discovery, dragg'd to Ruin; The Rack, the Sword, Impaling, or the Gaunches Tearing his Limbs to pieces! And I, oh killing Terror! The fatal Cause of all! [Weeping. Assist, ye Gods, Keep firm my Brain, and prop my staggering Reason; Let Amidea now be worth your Care, For nothing else can save me from Despair. [Exit. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. A Prison Gate. Damocles Solus. Damo. Conscience, thou Terror of irresolute Minds, Phantastick Phantom that depriv'st the Soul With sordid Fear, of the due Veneration It ought to pay to that great God Ambition, Disturb my Peace no more; there is no room For any thing but Greatness in this Breast, All Thoughts beside are Base.âHow dar'st thou then Press, with thy nothing here, when I indulge In the Excesses of my tow'ring Fortune, Lull'd in soft Ease and Riot, the bent Bodies And humble Looks of Suppliants imploring; With the large Train of gaudy Flatterers, Who wait, as if I were the Delphian God, To worship my uprising? Thou intrudest, And meagre as the Skeliton of Death, Pretend'st to moralize; giving Reflections That Favourites, like Beacons set on high, May warn the rest of Danger by their Blaze; But first consume themselves, that State and Opulence Beget the People's Hate,âand that their Ruin. This thou would'st fright me with; poor dull ChimÃ¦ra's, Bugbears o'th' Vulgar, spiritless and base, But shall be my Diversion. I ne'er enter My Garden but methinks the Statue there Of Pallas, Vesta, Daphne and Diana, All taking on themselves Clorona's Figure, With Daggers stab at me; at which, perhaps, I start, and for a Minute may be ruffled; But straight all's drown'd within the Greekish Bowl, Then something new, and wicked, Charms my Soul. Enter Cilon with a Letter. Who's there, oh Cilon! Well, my Friend, what News? Cilon. So, please your Lordship, I have here in Charge A Letter of Importance.âWhere's the King, 'Tis from the Princess? Damo. What, Gilmunda, hah, his darling Daughter? Cilon. Yes, my Lord, I had th'Honour from her own fair Hands. Damo. He promis'd to be this Instant here, on a Design T'harangue th'Imprison'd Ladies with some Orders, Some new Commands; he'd have 'em send their Husbands Without their Walls. Has there been ought of Note Since the last Sally, I've been busied elsewhere. Cilon. Nothing, my Lord, of Worth, since I commanded The Party that beat 'em off from the last Bastion. I hope your Lordship heard how th'Counterscarp Was taken; and where I order'd 'em to spring the Mine, When the Enemy design'd upon our Trenches, Near the South Ravelin; there, if your Lordship's ignorant, I must be bold to say, I pepper'd 'em: They have got Ground since, I hear, and are come up Close to our Pallisades.âBut if the King, my Lord, Would take my Counselâ Damo. Oh! no doubt he will, [Trumpet sounds within. I hear he's not far off, let's go and meet him. [Exeunt. Enter from the Prison's inner part Belizaria, Helmige and Ladies, Clindor, and other Children. Helm. The Tyrant's coming, Madam. Beliz. So is, sweet Friend, our latter Day fatal, And ruinous, like him; let us with brave Contempt then Receive 'em both alike; are all our Friends here Join'd in Opinion, and resolv'd unanimously On what was last consulted? Helm. All most firmly, And chiefly declare, a Death with Honour Prefer'd before the least ignoble Action, To taint their Memories. Beliz. Let me hear 'em own it, Methinks the very Sound is so seraphical, The Joy will fill my Heart. What say ye, Ladies, Can ye? For without doubt when Aristander Comes to discourse Affairs, he'll make Proposals Fit for his Interest, tho' to your Dishonour. Can ye resist? Shall not his Flattery tempt ye, Nor Threatnings fright ye to debase your Honour, And so betray your Country? 1 Lady. No, we are confirm'd. 2 Lady. And all resolv'd to bend our Resolutions To what you shall think proper in your Answer. 3 Lady. And this we all have sworn to. Omnes. All, all, all. Beliz. Instead of Infamy, a Death with Honour. Death!âWell, and what is Death, hoary Philosophers Term it a leap i'th' dark! A Disquisition Horrid, yet natural.âSenseless Contradiction, Death is no more than Nature's final Couch, Whereon she rests from Cares; so easy too That little Birds endure it without Noise, And Infants with a Sigh give back their Beings: Or if Disease or Age give some short Pangs, The Joy free Conscience brings, and balmy Honour So heals the Minute Woe, it turns to Pleasure. Helm. And tho' the Separation, may seem terrible, Of Soul and Body, like two ancient Friends Of long Acquaintance, that are loth to part; Yet when we think of the Future Stateâ Beliz. Ay, my Helmige, that Scene of lasting Glory, Where impious Tyrants act no cruel Part; Nor dreadful Revolutions can molest us, There's the Reward still of a Death with Honour; Life's a short Voyage to that heavenly Place, Prepar'd to recompense our anxious Days; To which the Soul in her frail Vessel stow'd, Thro' numerous Dangers makes its vent'rous Road; And painfully o'er Rocks and Sands do's ride Thro' the tempestuous War of Wind and Tide: Endures the Storms above that boisterous grow, And booming Terrors of the Deeps below; 'Till past Vexations that each Moment chance On Nature's Sea, of frail Intemperance, The blissful Haven do's at last appear, Where endless Joy succeeds short Pain and Fear. Enter Aristander, Damocles, Cilon, and Guards. Arist. So, my good Subjects of the Viper kind, You bare it bravely still; these great Successes Without the Walls, by your victorious Husbands, Add Freshness to your Cheeks; my Clemency, I see, has been to blame, I shou'd have stinted ye Of your high Diet, and your Ease; a Woman Must be kept low, if you wou'd have her humble. Damo. Just like the Viper you were speaking of, Wear 'em within your Bosom, they shall sting ye; But let 'em feel the frozen Blast a little, The Venom cools, then you may turn and wind 'em Just as you please. Cilon. All Women are to me a sort of Cockatrices, And kill me with a Look,âas I do them. Arist. But think not but I note your Insolencies, Your proud Contempt, and your neglect of Duty; Especially of you, their Captain here, [To Beliz. Who are, no doubt, most wonderfully pleas'd With your new Hopes of Liberty. Beliz. My Soul do's still enjoy its Liberty, That soars aloft above thy Power to fetter; And for my Body in this impious World, Where Villainy has got such monstrous Privilege, 'Tis not worth thinking on, enslav'd or free. Arist. Most Heroine-like deliver'd; let the Devil, If he would act Pride nearer to the Life Than he's yet Master of, copy it there. But I have no time to trifle.âHear me, And with regard, for it concerns ye nearly; Your Husbands, a vile Rout of lawless Rebels, Have dar'd to take up Arms 'gainst me their Master, As insolently have besieg'd my City; And tho' I cou'd confound 'em in my Anger, Scatter 'em like a Flock of fearful Crows Upon a Field of Grain.âYet my indulgent Grace Moves me another way more mild and gentle, And guides me calmly to remand their Duty, Before my Power storms with Extremity. Sit down, take Pen and Ink then all, and write; Write with a Tenderness your Sex is skill'd in; When you design and purpose to inveigle; Intreat, that for your Sakes, to save your Lives, Which else shall surely second the Refusal, Straightway to raise the Siege, and to retire. Damo. The Matron starts; there, the proud Heart being pinch'd, Shrinks at the biting Pain.âHow the rest stare too? [To Cilon. Arist. Nor shall your puny Lives atone th'Affront, But what's far dearer to ye still,âyour Children, Without considering either Sex or Age, Mangled, dismembred, torn and cut in pieces, Shall, as a Present, on each Soldier's Blade, Be sent your Husbands the next Sally made. Beliz. Now, dear Helmige, the fatal Crisis comes, With Aspect horrible! Clindor is playing amongst the Children. Helm. The Gods direct ye. Damo. Your toysome Chit, there, will have little reason To thank his Mother for her Obstinacy, Should you hold out; be wise then, and go scrawl, The King's not in a Humour to be play'd with; Think on the Boy. Beliz. Oh, do not name him, Monster! Lest thy invenom'd Breath, tho' thus far off, Wither the infant Bloomings of his Face, Lately his wretched Mother's chief Delight, With loathsom Leprosy. Arist. 'Sdeath!âDare ye then delay? Now, by the Gods of Greece, let it be done, Write quickly, or ? Beliz. Oh! that those bounteous Gods Should give Mankind a Figure like themselves, To damn it so with Frowning. Arist. Death and Hell! Am I still trifled with? Who am I, hah! Am I not Aristander, my Will absolute? Which whoe'er dares to disobey, my Breath, Like darting Lightning, can consume to Atoms; To Dust in th'Moment!âBriefly then, will ye write? Beliz. Then briefly no; Believe not, cruel Tyrant, because Women, Thy Threats shall awe us to betray our Country; And by the Weakness of our Sex and Fear Nature imposes; for our Childrens Slaughter Shall e'er destroy the Means of publick Liberty To all the Ellien Race. No, Aristander, [Boldly to him. The Tract our Husbands have begun we'll follow; Follow with Wills unanimous, confirm'd too With Venture of our Lives. Arist. You will, you say; By Heaven 'tis brave, fantastically brave. Come, think agen e'er 'tis too late. Damo. Scrawl, scrawl; Ten Billet Deux had been blur'd o'er by this time: Begin your Conjuring. Beliz. I will not write a Tittle; No, let the Consequence be what Heaven pleases, The Happiness of Corinth to be freed From such abominable Tyranny, Out-vies, by far, the Woes that we can suffer. Arist. Oh! there's the Bar, the Hopes you have of Freedom By Force and Conquest; but remember Hecate, You shall be nothing e'er that comes to pass; Your rebel Off-spring too be chopt to Fragments, And thrown to Fowls o'th' Air. Beliz. 'Twill be some Comfort To know those airy Executioners Soon after shall revenge that Cruelty, And gorge upon the Carcass of a Tyrant More ravenous than they. Arist. Fetch her Brat hither. Damo. I'll do ye that kind Office. [Damocles fetches Clindor, who is playing with an Orange amongst the Children. Beliz. And Pluto one for thee in happy time: Go, Clindor, go, my little Angel, willingly, [Tenderly to Clindor. To meet thy heavenly Play-fellows above; And bless the Gods, dear Boy, that frees thee from The Slavery thy wretched Country suffers; Thou art the second Martyr crown'd for Corinth: Make haste, my Darling, from yon' starry Mansion, Bright Cherubims will soar to fetch thee thither, And please thy innocent Soul with Joys innumerable. [Here Clindor looking pityfully in Aristander's Face, offers him the Orange he was playing with, who spurns him away. Arist. Ha, ha, ha, ha, give the Brat the Joys she speaks of; this Minute comply, or ? [Here one of the Guards stabs Clindor. Beliz. Now help, relenting Nature, ye blest Deities, [Trembles and stands silent. Arist. Ha!âstubborn still!âStrike, strike then, and throw it to her sprawling. [The Guards kill Clindor. Beliz. Ah!âworst of Devils! [Shrieks. Arist. I'll make ye change your Note. [Walking about ragingly. Beliz. No, Tyrant, thou shalt never; Tho' thou hast done a Deed would make thy fellow Fiends Blush even in Hell, with a much deeper red Than Fire can imitate! Make all Nature dumb, Stupid with Horror, [Wringing her Hands. yet shall the anguish of my Soul Breath out new Curses and perish to Death! Oh my Soul's Happiness! [Throws her self upon Clindor. Art thou then gone, that pretty prattling Tongue That was each Day my most delightful Musick, Untun'd for ever? Oh! could that cursed Hand Do this, and yet not rot dropping to Earth! Ye Powers, since this can be, from henceforth then Let injur'd Innocence despair of Vengeance. Arist. Vengeance is me, I'm Fate, and will controul; Not the fictitious Terrors of the Priesthood Charming the Gods to shower down Plagues upon me, Nor all the juggling Magick of their Trade Shall ever change me from my fixt Resolve; My Will's my Law, and born to be a Monarch; My Province is to govern, without weighing What's Right or Wrong, Justice, or otherwise; 'Tis just enough if I command: [To Helmige and the rest. Once more then, Since by Example I have shewn ye now What I intend to prosecute, will ye yet write, And save the rest? Helm. Never, [Raising her Voice. tho' utmost Cruelty fall upon us and ours. Omnes. We never, never will. Arist. Hags, Witches, Furies seize 'em, I'm all Flame! [Raging. Beliz. Oh! ye most noble, virtuous, best of Women, [Rising and embracing the Ladies. You now out-do the Heroines of old, So practis'd in the glorious Laws of Honour; How, when this poor weak Mansion of your Bodies Shall crumble into Dust, shall your bright Names In Golden Letters deck the Monuments, That Time shall ne'er erase? [Turns to Aristander. Now, cruel Tyger, For thou art lost to all Humanity; Reflect with Shame, how far a Woman's Honour Excels thy Power; senseless, feeble Woman, Undaunted, can defie the Rage of Tyrants: Woman, well arm'd with the strong Mail of Virtue, Can smile on Racks, Wheels, Axes, Swords or Poyson: Woman, defies the Rage of Hell, and th'worst, The great Devil thereâcurst Aristander. [In extreme Passion. Arist. Defiance is a Call to Combatâthere! [Offers to kill her, who stands still boldly opposing 'till Demetrius rushes and parrys his Sword. How now! how darest thou cross me? Hah! sure my Eyes dazzle, speak, Art thou not Demetrius? Demet. I am, Sir, happy Demetrius now, since 'tis my Fortune To save great Aristander from an Action That would for ever have eclips'd his Glory, The Blood of simple Women; let your Enemies, Who now are in the Snare, Sir, feel your Sword. To be more plain, Sir, first know Grimoald is taken. Arist. That's well, now I begin to understand thee. Demet. And shall have better Reason, Sir: I've long Been curst with Misconstruction from your Majesty, But now kind Fate is pleas'd to give the Means Of shewing Proofs of my Fidelity. [Belizaria throws her self agen on Clindor. Arist. 'Tis well, there has indeed been some Suspicions. Demet. Besides my apprehending then that Traytor, I have encountred, Sir, by being diligent, Some friendly Messengers sent from Craterus, Your Royal Friend and Ally; who inform ye Ten Thousand Men are on the March already To raise the Siege, which will be done to Morrow. Arist. My brave Demetrius, this is indeed such Tidings As I could wish for, and a piece of Service Which shall not be ill paid.âPrithee, good Friend, Forget what's past, the Value of good Jewels Are never known 'till try'd; I'll make Amends; this coming Night, then Thou, and I, and Damocles Will make Collation with our trusty Messengers; And after we have examin'd that Dog Grimoald, Consult about a Sally; at that Juncture The others shall attack. Damo. Easily done, Sir, and surprize Timoleon. Arist. Oh! I could eat his Heart, and th'Bandog Governor's. Come, Friends, let's to our Strangers, no Affair now But this, shall fill my Thought; here is a Letter Just sent from my Gilmunda, News of some Trick I warrant Upon her preaching Sister.âPrithee read it at thy Leisure; [Gives Demetrius the Letter. And humour her, you are acquainted.âYou Officer, Go lock up those she Wolves, who e'er next Sun Will howl out loud Repentance for their Insolence, And in return meet Scorn.âCome, my Demetrius. Demet. Please ye to grant me, Sir, but one short Minute With the Virago there, I have something new to teaze her with. Arist. And dost me Pleasure in't; [Officer takes off Helmige and Ladies. she has lost her Cub there, And is in Tears, damn'd Traytress, insolent Fury! Fate grant me but her Husband in my Power, Then my Revenge is perfect. [Exeunt Aristander, Damocles, Cilon and Guards. Manent Demetrius and Belizaria. Demet. So, hitherto it prospers; shine out my Stars, Cloud not one Spark of your propitious Radiance From your Demetrius; and thou, my better Genius, My sweet Clorona, let thy sacred Spirit Be still at hand to hallow my Revenge. Hah! here agen, [Ghost appears, smiles and Exit. by Heaven, and smil'd upon me. Nay, then my Enterprize succeeds I'm sure, Those Looks have no Portent but Happiness. Now to my Letter here, I'm grown a Man in Trust, Damocles will grow jealous if this hold. Oh Fate! [Reads the Letter and starts. Oh my lov'd Genius! Is this possible! By Heaven, a fatal Letter from the Princess, Discovering mine, and our close Correspondence With the Ãtolian Governor; which had the King but seen My Life had gone with Torment, shewing this lost Paper, Which has so terrify'd me, lest any Foe should find it. Now I perceive too, why blest Clorona smil'd, Which shews the Fate of Tyranny is fix'd To give it due Reward.âOh Belizaria! [Coming to her. If thy deep Sorrows can afford an Ear To one that brings thee News of sweet Revenge, And Comfort, hear me speak? Beliz. Oh Heaven! Comfort! Is Comfort possible, when such Griefs as mine Press on the loaded Heart, and crush it down? Demet. The sacred Powers, that have their Cause for all The Infelicities of human Life, Have, in their Turn, the Means of Comfort too; And have, no doubt, reserv'd for you some Share To mitigate your Sorrows: Let your Sense then Be thus instructed: E'er the Sun shall drive This burnisht Carr twice round the Universe, Timoleon shall be found a Conqueror, And, crown'd with Laurel, bless the Streets of Corinth. Beliz. Are then the Guardian Angels of the City Return'd again? Will they be good to Corinth, And to the rest of the Distress'd within? No longer suffer Aristander's Cruelty, Nor let his horrid Ministers of Death Gorge in the Vitals of their Infant Sons? I Joy to hear it, but withal must say I was forgot, they were not so to mine. [Weeping over Clindor. Demet. Divert the Thought, dear Madam, with the Prospect Of Comforts that are coming. Beliz. My poor Boy! Forgive, ye Gods, if thus a Mother's Passion Forgets her Reverence, was not so much your Care. Demet. The awful Deities have secret Ends In all these wond'rous Acts, and Resignation Is our chief point of Duty.âFate is tir'd With the ill Dooms fal'n on unhappy Corinth, And has resolv'd to make her Satisfaction. Beliz. Me 'tis impossible; Oh Heaven! what Satisfaction! [Weeping tenderly. Demet. Nay all the tutelar Divinities Join on our side; amongst the rest, Clorona, The sacred Genius of our hopeful Enterprize, Whilst you lay there o'erwhelm'd in Floods of Sorrow, Appear'd; and with a propitious Smile On you and me, dispersing Influence, Gave Omen of Success, and safe Revenge. Beliz. That then, a while, shall raise me from the Grave [Rising up. A little Bustle must be done in the World; Then to my darling Angel I'll return, [Kissing Clindor. Make his cold Bed, and gently lie down by him. Demet. The Voice of Fame eternally must sing In your Applause, the noble Grecian Heroine Will be a Theme to all Futurity For our immortal Bards upon their Lyres, To charm the World with, and in Womens Right Renown their wond'rous Constancy and Honour. Beliz. Traverse the Stories of immortal Heroes, Penn'd by the noblest Hands in their Applause For doing Wonders in their Country's Service; Contempt of Danger, and Heart-breaking Woes, Let 'em be all enrol'd and canoniz'd; And, when they are sum'd up to the last Degree, Then let all tender Mothers write of me. [Looking tenderly and kissing Clindor. Demet. A Theme for ever to be celebrated Whilst Time exists, and Humans have a Being. Come then, thou Soul of Honour, rouze and cherish Thy noble Heart with Courage, clear thy Brow, And then prepare thy self to bear a part In the ensuing Wonders. Beliz. Lead the way, [Takes up Clindor's Body in her Arms. Revenge inspires me, and I'll try to follow, Clearing sad Looks, as if my Heart were easy: But as the wounded Deer, by Hunters prest, Bearing a Shaft deep in his wounded Breast, Bounds over spatious Plains, do's Mountains climb; And makes the best of his short dated Time T'avoid his Pain; from thence he hops, he flies, Runs, then stops short, and several ways he tries; But vainly strives his former Rest to win, The Dart sticks fast, the Grief is still within. [Exeunt, she carrying out Clindor's Body. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. Enter Demetrius meeting Zizimo. Demet. Stand, give the Word e'er you pass farther. Zizim. Demetrius? Demet. Oh, honest Captain,âcome opportunely To forward Matters in this Night of Wonders. Zizim. Wonders indeed, my Lord; for sure till now Never was City taken in such Silence: No Stir, no Noise, in such a hush of Quiet, That when the Postern-gate was open'd to us To let the General in, and all that follow'd; When those who made Resistance were cut off, 'Twas done with such a Stillness, as if Death Made purposely quick Work to prevent Outcries. Demet. The Tyrant being in th'heighth of his Security, By his Neglect, made th'Enterprize so easy, Never was Bird of Prey caught in a Snare So pleas'd as he, ignorant of what is past, He has been drinking largely with his Favourite, Suspecting nought even here, in my Apartment; And I'm now sent to fetch th'suppos'd Grimoald With th'Messengers of Craterus; who they are, And what the end of this Night's Work must be, Go with me and be satisfy'd. I've promis'd Musick too To entertain himâI'm now a Primiere Minister. Zizim. Thus the just Gods ordain the Fate of Tyranny, When things most dangerous have easiest Turns. First, that the Letter lost, of such dire Consequence Had Aristander seen't, should fall so contrary; Then, that the Creature of proud Damocles, Train'd up so long in Villainy, and trusted With Packets to Craterus to raise Succours, Should at that Crisis, by reason of a Grudge Taken perhaps, about some Suit refus'd, Revolt, and straight discover the main Secret That has cut all their Throats. Demet. Nay, and to me too, His Master's known, resolv'd Remembrancer, Is half a Miracle! Why, Captain, I'm so trusted, That even this Night, when we surpriz'd the Guards, They star'd on me as if they thought 'twas done By the King's Order. Zizim. The Ãtolian Soldiers Are plund'ring now the Palace, and th'Tyrant's Daughters Expos'd to utmost Fury. Demet. Which I'll prevent, if possible, for Amidea's sake, Tho' much I fear; but first let's make the Game Secure with Aristander.âGuards are ambush'd, And every thing in Order, come thou along And help on my Disguise.âSee, yonder he comes Like a fell Dragon, gorg'd with hop'd Revenge; There let him Bask a while, we'll to our Work. Zizim. I'm glad there's Joy in's Face.â'Tis ominous. [Exeunt. Enter Aristander. Arist. I heard a Noise, no doubt 'tis the new Succours, And the great Work is doing; where Timoleon And the Rebel Crowd shall crush beneath my Vengeance. Fate, thou hast serv'd me now as I could wish, And like a God in yon' celestial Dome, Methinks I fix me here an equal Deity. Oh Power! thou darling Mistress of my Soul, I will enjoy thee now with my full Gust, In spite of crawling Insects, the base Vulgar; Who tho' they all exist by my warm Beams, Yet envy me in my Glory.âPower, thou Creator Supreme, first Cause of perfect Happiness, What is not done by thee?âTo thee the Miser Tenders the Golden Idol of his Soul, Dearer than that by far; to thee the Transports That Beauty brings with that sweet angelick kind, Are humbly offer'd; high exalted State, Honour's bright Wreaths, and awful Dignity; Bent Knees of Vassals, flowing Eyes of Suppliants, With the vast Train of diligent Attendants, All waiting for the Hand or Nod to execute, Subservient are to thee, celestial Power. Feast, feast my Soul then, sate thy self with Joy, Indulge in Bliss which nothing can destroy. Enter Damocles. Hah! Shall we not, my Damocles? Damo. No doubt you should, Sir. Arist. Thou smil'st, what's the occasion? Damo. To think that you, who are this God in Power, Should let a trifling Mortal, pufft up with Pride, Oppose the darling Pleasure of your Heart, And by that Insolence boast a Power above ye. Arist. Ah, thou meanest Belizaria! Furies take her, The Lust I had t'enjoy her is now turn'd Into Revenge, which she shall feel, and suddenly. Damo. Revenge your self upon her Beauty first; Take that, I know 'twill please ye still t'enjoy her: For to do Justice, tho' she acts a Fury, Her Body's moulded of celestial Matter, And must exquisitely charm. When I saw her Lately in Prison, mourning her young Cub, Methought her Eyes in Tears cast still more Sweetness; Her Cheeks, that wore an Air of solemn Sorrow, Flush'd with warm Blood, shew'd such a pure Vermilion, Would infuse vig'rous Warmth to frozen Hermits, And make 'em languish in a new Desire. Arist. Nay, th'Enchantress has her Charms 'tis true. Damo. Then as she lay, Her well-form'd Shape extended on the Floor, Raising her self a little, Oh! what Heaven Appear'd about her Neck and swelling Breasts, That with her Passion heaving still, and falling, Expos'd at large the beauteous demi Globes, Soft as Swans Down, and white as Virgin Lillies: Not CitherÃ¦a, when the Dardan Prince Gave her the Prize for his transporting Object, Was grac'd with half her Charms. Arist. Curst stubborn Traytress! Damo. Stubborn; why Sir, the Pride of the Resistance Adds still more to the Pleasure of the Conquest; I was born, Sir, to further your Delights, And would not have you miss a Joy so singular, Because the Nymph, forsooth, is coy and sullen. Arist. Thou'rt in the right, I will have her, I've now resolv'd on't. Damo. Besides, shall that old Rebel That Fate ne'er durst intend to be her Husband, Unless to be your CuckoldâShall he boast He has out-rival'd mighty Aristander? No, were I you, possest with Means and Power, I'd shew Distinction between King and Vassal; I'd soon divert that scandalous Disgrace, And have my Will to prove superior Pleasure. Arist. It shall be so; thou'st fir'd me, bring her on th'Instant, [To an Officer. 'Twill be a proper Sport, join'd with the Musick, I hear they are preparing. Damo. I've yet more News, and happy for ye, Sir. Arist. My best of Friends. Damo. A Chest of Treasure found of old Timoleon's, 'Mongst which, 'tis said, there is one Gem inestimable, Hoarded, no doubt, for his rebellious Use, Is seized, and brought ye hither. Arist. Ye Gods, this is too much, my Joys crowd on too thick. Damo. Long may they last, Sir. [Musick sounds. Oh the Entertainment Is just beginning; please to sit, Sir. Arist. My second self, sit by me. Here Demetrius is brought in by Zizimo, disguis'd like Grimoald, and suppos'd bound; with him Timoleon, Pollidamus, Gomond, disguis'd as the Messengers of Craterus, then Cilon and a Chest. Arist. Is that the Ruffian Traytor? Damo. Yes, Sir, that's Grimoald, he had the same Habit When he late 'scap'd me, he was doom'd, Sir, for the Gaunches. Arist. Thou shalt be cloy'd with Vengeance. Musick sound, then a Song and Dance done, expressing the Reward of Tyranny. Zizim. The Sports being ended, Sir, and I hope suitable To your great Thoughts, tho' somewhat moralizing, Be pleas'd to taste a better Entertainment, Luscious Revenge; here's Grimoald, your sworn Foe, What Death, what Torture, for your chief Diversion, Please ye t'allot him? Arist. I will consider on't, 'Twill take time, I'll have something new and exquisite For such a Dog. [Frowning on Demetrius. Zizim. Oh, Sir, Delays are dangerous. Demet. I'll be more quick with him, He shall be torn in pieces instantly; I dare pronounce it, I, Demetrius, [Discovering himself. Nearest of Blood to th'late Corinthian Monarch. Arist. Hah, Demetrius!âWhat means this? Damo. Treason! Treason! Timol. Contriv'd to crush your Dignity. [Timoleon stamps, and Guards rush in, who with Pollidamus seize Damocles. Pollid. I hope you'll use your Interest for a Pardon, Sir. [To Damocles. Cilon. Adsheart, what's here to do, within there, Treason! Treason! Here's a very fine Business. Gomon. 'Tis so, and falls exactly to do yours, [Kills Cilon. my fine Court Caterpillar. Cilon. Ah Lard! I'm stuck.âAh! here's a pretty Business. [Dies. Arist. Betray'd! surpriz'd! Art thou then such a Traytor? [To Demetrius. Demet. Here is my Answer. [Brings up Timoleon who stares at Aristander. Arist. Thy Eyes, like Daggers, Seem to stare at me. Hah! what art thou? Speak. Timol. My Name will stab thee worse, take it, Timoleon. [Discovers himself. Arist. The Devil! Timol. Right, in th'instant come to damn thee. Damo. Oh, damn'd, damn'd Fate! Demet. I'll leave him to your Justice, noble Father, I've Business elsewhere, drag that Hell-hound after me. [To some of the Guards. Damo. Let Hell-hounds, if a Hell there be, torment me, Gnaw, mangle, tear, so they do but lend an Hour Of Joy to see that hoary Rebel's Cuckoldom; The Rape was well contriv'd I'm sure: Curst Fortune, To lour on such a blest Design. Demet. Stop, stop his Mouth, away. [Exit Demetrius and Zizimo, Guards dragging out Damocles, and more appear on t'other side. Pollid. Nay, you're fast in the Trap, My gracious Prince of Clemency, Whence neither Earth nor Hell can ever save ye, and Heaven I'm sure wo'not; your Creature too I'll see shall have true Wages. [Exit Pollidamus. Timol. Go seek my Wife, good Gomond, and deliver what I late order'd. [Exit Gomond. Oh all ye avenging Powers! [Exit Gomond. Now give me Patience to out-face the Horror That strikes me from that Object; for not MÃ¦dusa With her fell Gorgon Shield, nor Snaky Tresses, Were ever seen so terrible. Arist. Since I am then so terrible, Let Fear supply the place of proper Duty, And get thee from me; for to turn the Notion, The self same Gorgon thou art now to me. Timol. No, I'm ordain'd to be your Slave in waiting, And have not shew'd ye yet Timoleon's Treasure. Yonder's a Jewel, Sir, which, Miser like, [Pointing to the Chest. My Soul once doated on; my greedy Eye Was never satisfy'd with gazing on it, Nor my Heart free from Trouble for its Safety; Yet being doom'd your Prize, the Robbery I must bear as I can. Arist. Oh! I forgive it thee, Take back thy Treasure so thou wilt be gone: Timol. No, no, 'tis past my Use now, and only fit for thine; For Ornament then hang it on thy Breast, 'Twas once of a true Lustre; unlock the Coffer there, And bring it to his Mightiness. [Here the Soldiers open the Chest and take out Clindor's dead Body, Timol. takes it in his Arms. Behold, Sir, here it is. Hah! what! d'ye start? Arist. The Boy! a new MÃ¦dusa, and more horrid: [Starts and looks amaz'd. Timol. Here is my Gem; on this with covetous Eyes I us'd to gaze, 'till I even crackt their Opticks; My Heart was fill'd with Cares how to preserve it; Yet mixt with Joy too, being the blest Possessor Of this, my all, thy barbarous Power has robb'd me. Unset the Jewel, sully'd its bright Lustre, And what was noted of such hopeful Merit, Had Time improved its Value, that great Monarchs Greater than thou can'st dream of, or imagine, Would have been proud t'have worn within their Bosoms, Hast thou defac'd, for which thou art this Moment Just hurrying into Hell. Arist. Hah! who shall dare To force me to ride Post on such a Journey? Timol. Those that retain as small Regard for Tyrants As Tyrants do for Justice or for Honour. [Gives Clindor to one of the Guards. All these here dare. Stamps with his Foot, and more Soldiers rush in with Daggers drawn, and surround Aristander. All these here, at my Motion, or a Word, Shall quicker send thy Soul, thou purple Monster, To those low Dungeons than etherial Flame Could pierce thee from above. Arist. Senseless Bravado, Thy peevish Age grown testy in th'extreme, Now makes thee rave, else thou wouldst trembling own There is Divinity about a King, Which is perpetual Guard. Timol. About good Kings, I grant there is a strong and sacred Virtue That would unedge the Sword of Treachery; But thou, first a Usurper, then a Tyrant, Set up in Blood, and in it ever reigning; Making thy Death an Action meritorious, Hast nothing but the Fiends of Hell about thee, That gape, and grin, and howl for thy Destruction. Arist. Well, I'm a King however, let that awe thee. Timol. Thou art not mine, Demetrius was my King; A virtuous Prince, that govern'd still with Justice; His Coronation Oath, Cement of Royalty, (Which when a King once breaks, the Subjects Faith May well be brittle too) he kept inviolable. Thy ill built Title, rais'd on th'Chance of War, And Revolution of one fatal Battle, Weakly would force my Homage; especially When Tyranny, like thine, is the Result on't. Arist. Rebellion do's authorize Tyranny. Timol. Cruelty and Injustice form Rebellion, And that thou art worst Foe to human Nature, To Justice, and to Pity, is shewn here. [Taking and shewing Clindor. Canst thou, thou damn'd, beyond the rage of Hell, From all thy Pyramids of Power, give back The rosie Breath that once perfum'd these Lips, Pleasing my Ear, and ravishing my Heart? Or those warm Springs that made this heavenly Cheek Blush like Aurora, which could my Heart replenish With Blood that it containsâOh thou lov'd Angel! My Soul's best Joy, and quintescential Part, [Hugs and kisses Clindor. How should thy Father's Spirits gush into thee, And with the Remnant of my Life infus'd Raise thee agen? but oh! 'tis impossible. Arist. My Soul relents, and scarce can bear this Object. [Aside. Timol. Besides, where's my Clorona?âOh Devil! Devil! [Raising his Voice. That Mischief, in the Heap, was half forgotten; Why, what a Rout, what a dire Desolation Has this wild Boar, with his sharp savage Tusks, Made in my Bowels?âYet shall I not dare To gore him in Revenge.âHorror! Damnation! Sheath all your Daggers in him! [To the Soldiers. Dare! Stamps ragingly. Not dare! Arist. Stand off, ye Villains, hear me speak, Timoleon. Timol. What, wouldst thou beg to pray?âPerdition seize thee! That were more Impudence than yet discover'd, To hope the Gods will balk my just Revenge, By pardoning thy black Soul; no, let Hell take it Fresh from the bloody Shambles where it dwelt, [Ragingly. Spotted as it is, not one curst Crime abated, Else my Revenge were poor. [Soldiers prepare agen to stab. Arist. Hear, for thy own Soul's sake. Timol. Unreasonable Fiend, but come, thy last then. Arist. Thou art a Soldier, and well know'st my Title; Be it thy Glory then, if yet thou hold'st In that craz'd Urn a Spark of the old Valour, To let it now break out upon a King; And let not Story make such hideous Blots To shew how base born Vassals did thee Justice Upon the King thy Master.âDo it thy self, Come, thus unarm'd I dare thee. Timol. Dare me, dost thou? 'Tis then, because thou think'st, being all o'er Devil, Thou hast not human Flesh enough about thee To feel my Rage. Arist. If thou deny'st, 'tis Fear and Cowardice. Timol. Oh ye Immortals, Cowardice! How that curst blasting Word has fir'd my Heart, Nay, and resolv'd me now to do't my self. Retire, my Soldiers. [They seem unwilling, but go out, he giving them Clindor. Nayâno Words, I'll have it so: And tho' thou hast deserv'd no Usage honourable, Yet since there's something left thee, of a Soldier, For Kingship's nothingâThis last manly daring Has arm'd thee for Defenceâ[Gives him a Sword. There, now come on, young Wolf, And thou shalt see how the old Man can muzzle thee; For be assur'd, my Vengeance carries Thunder; And whilst my Clindor's, and Clorona's Wrongs, Sharpen my Point, and sinew my old Flesh. The Force of Tyrant Armies were too small, And I, in such a Cause, should conquer all. [Here they fight, Timol. kills Arist. but is mortally wounded himself. Arist. I have it, and I think too, so hast thou; That's yet some Comfort.âBut oh! weak and poor Is the vain boasted Vigour, that my Youth Believed invincibleâI would fain think now, But that my Spirits, with my Blood, are posting To their new some-where,âThat's my greatest Pang; Oh! that some welcome Blaze of Lightning now Would dart, and crust all Nature in a Moment. But Darkness comes instead,âBlack gloomy Horrour; Whilst shaking, with the cold vile Curse of Fear, I struggle, sink, and plunge, I know not where. [Dies. Re-enter Pollidamus and Soldiers, with Clindor. Pollid. So, Tyrany is fal'n thenâThat's as it should be; But what, my Lord, what means this Blood appearing? You would not weakly sure attack a Lion; You had in th'Toyle. Timol. The Royal Viper stung me With the word Coward, which, with Reproach of Age, Tainting my Honour, rouz'd th'old Spirit in me, To take Revenge my self for my poor Boy, And my belov'd CloronaâSend him after me. [To the Soldiers. For tho' I find the boarish Paws have scratch'd me, Yet have I Life enough to see due Punishment Done on his Monster Damocles. Pollid. 'Tis preparing: Nor will the Ellien Crowd be satisfied, Till they're possest of Aristander's Body, To use it as they please. Timol. Go, bear it to 'em,âKeep, keep House, my Soul, A little longer, then away, and willingly. [Exit leaning on Pollidamus. SCENE II. Enter Belizaria and Gomond. Gomon. Now, Madam, your propitious, Stars shine clear; The Tyrant's fal'n e'er this. Beliz. Did my Lord send for me? Gomon. He did, Madam, to see the Execution done on Damocles, And his proud Master, of whose cursed Race Not one have 'scap'd the eager People's Fury. I saw his Daughters led out by two Ruffians, Who, because Virgins, are giv'n up by the Officers; First to be ravish'd, to evade the Law, Then executed: Yonder, I think, they come, brought by their Plunderers, As I suppose, expecting your Reward, Giving you full Revenge for your Son Clindor. Enter, Gilmunda, and Amidea with Hair dishevel'd, dragg'd by Longin and Bilboe, their Swords drawn. Beliz. Have Mercy, Heaven, what dreadful Sight is this? Gomon. Look up with Joy, Madam, and take just Revenge Upon the hated Offspring of the Tyrant, That wallow'd in the Blood of your dear Son. I must to th'General. [Exit. Gomond. Beliz. Dear, dear indeed! As ever tender Mother smil'd upon, When the Birth Pangs were o'er, but yet alas, Tho' my poor Clindor's murther'd; how are these guilty? But then RevengeâThese are o'th' Tyrants Blood, As my sweet Boyâwas mine. [Sighs. Longin. Come, come, little Lindabrides, come along, why here's [To Amid.] Fortune in a Bag now; gad little did I think to have ever been a Prince of the Blood, in right of Alliance. Amid. Oh Misery, Oh help, ye Divine Powers! Longin. Oh yonder she is! I'm sure we shall have a swinging Reward. D'ye hear, Corporal Bilboe, shall I make the Speech, or you? Bilboe. Why look'e, I must be so bold, Serjeant, for all you're my superior Officer, to tell ye you'll find your self a Fool, to trouble her about it; a Pox on Rewards, as the Case stands now; my Head's upon somewhat else, and a Plague upon Speeches too; adzooks I have such a mind to my princely Mistress here, that I'll make none for my Part; Speeches will take up time, gad I'm in hast [Holding Gilmund. Gilm. Stab me, ye barbarous Slaves; oh kill me! Kill me, but keep off your filthy Hands. Bilboe. Hands, why what's the matter with my Hands?â Humh, 'tis true, they are not made of March-pane, as yours are; they'll serve well enough, though, for what I shall put 'em too. Come, come, adzooks you must not stand upon Punctilios now. [Grasps her, she struggles. Beliz. Oh Heaven! can there be for poor Mortality, A Misery so great to equal this? And can compassionate Virtue look upon it Without Abhorrence? my Heart bleeds for 'em. Longin. Hem, hem, we have got these two Women, your Enemies, safe enough, and please your Honour; we have heard how little Master has been us'd, and like ye; and come now out of Respect forsooth, to know what Death you'd please to have 'em die; whether hanging, or stabbing, or cut-throating, or any way; we are ready, and please ye. Bilboe. Ay, ay, we'll revenge ye, I warrant ye; say but you the Word, it shall be done, any way, and please your Honour. Longin. And as for t'other, the ravishing part, od'slid I han't had a Princess fal'n to my Share a great while; I warrant ye, let me alone with her. Bilb. I like mine mainly well, faith; I love a plump full fed buxom Bit, you must know: I'll revenge ye, ne'er let your Honour doubt. Amid. Oh, if the Sense of Pity be not lost! Quite lost, in all the Foes of Aristander; Let a poor Virginâwretched in th'Extream, And fal'n from highest State to lowest Misery, Invoke those Eyes that seem to be relenting, To dart one Beam of Charity. Beliz. Oh my Heart! And thou chast Goddess, beautiful Diana, How shall my Conscience answer it to thee? That I've fulfill'd the Sacred Laws of Virtue; If I permit thy unpolluted Virgins To suffer Shame, whilst in my Power to save 'em. Long. She studies a little too long, methinks: Oh, now I believe she's feeling for her Purse. Bilb. Feeling for a Pudding, is not she? I'll tell ye, as I said before, gad you'll find your self a Fool, Serjeant,â I don't like these Delays; if we are not fobb'd at last, I'll be hang'd: Oons, if I might have carried it, I had been married to my Princess, or as good, by this time. Gilm. Oh most abhor'd of Slaves! Heavens! now, methinks, My stubborn Soul could condescend to beg, If I could get by't a Sword or Dagger. Long. 'Dslight, I tell thee she is feeling for her Purse; see, see there, now Corporal Codshead, who's the Fool now? Beliz. No, it shall never be declar'd in Story; Or said in times to come, that Belizaria Expos'd the Temple of Virginity To the vile Force of horrible Pollution, Through her Default,âhere FriendsâI know you brought These Prisoners thus, to shew the readiness Of your Good Wills, in furthering my Revenge. Take then my Thanks with this, and leave 'em with me: [Gives Longin a Purse. Long. HumhâWhy, there's the Devil on't, I was afraid of this all along, now Serjeant Shacklehead, how much is't Hugh? [They stare at one another. Long. A hundred Duckets, Corporal, 'tis more than their Cloaths are worth, however. Bilb. Cloaths, hundred Duckets,âhumâbut then to lose such a, such a, no gad it won't do; why look'e, Madamâ we thank'e heartily for your Bountifulness, but we must obey our Officer, d'ye see, and then the Law, and please ye. Beliz. Oh, as to those, I'll vouch with my Authority! Go, tell your OfficersâI took 'em from ye, Who nevertheless will so dispose of 'em, The People shall be satisfied, both theirs And my Revenges shall be perfected; Go, go, for Shame; [They look on the Ladies and grumble. Ha! sure dare not mutter? For honourably deserting a vile Custom, Invented by some Devil, as in Disgrace Of all Humanity,âIf you are Soldiers You should have Honour, which abhors this Action. Longin. Yes, yes, Madam, we are Soldiers, and we have HonourâBut, butâ Beliz. But what, can there be better proof of it than this? Bilboe. But those sweet, sweet, sucking Bottles; Oons, I shall never see such agen. Beliz. Away, I say, and dare not dispute; I'll rouze up Honour in ye, if you're resty. Longin. Come, there's no help for't; here's a good Purse, however But, CorporalâIf I had thought 'twould have come to thisâ Bilboe. Thought, Serjeant Suckegg, [Pushes him. a Pox upon ye, what could ye think less? well, never was such a Prize! never was such a Pair of dear sucking Bottles lost! a Pox upon ye.âCome away and be hang'd. [Exeunt grumbling and cursing one another. Gilm. Oh, noble Action! worthy fame Eternal. How does her sacred Virtue dissipate The odious Mists that lately clog'd my Reason, And made me know my self by true Reflection! Best of thy Sex, permit an humble Penitent, Converted by thy heavenly Influence, [Kneels to Beliz. And loathing former Errors, to adore thee. Oh pardon my late insolent Behaviour! Tutor'd by Hell, and blinded by curst Vice; I could not see that Purity of Goodness, Which now Calamity's true Mirror shews me. But oh! let Angel-pity blanch my Crime, And true Repentance lessen thy Resentment. Amid. Blest be thy Days, and doubly blest thy Nights, Thou Patroness of Piety and Honour, [Kneels on t'other side of Beliz. And may this Deed, so worthy of Applause, Be still thy Glory in succeeding Ages. Thy Fame in Songs of Joy, be anniversary, Whilst the whole Stock of spotless Maids renown thee. Beliz. Ye great Avengers, that from heavenly Thrones Pour out the Viols of your Indignation On impious Criminals, bear Witness for me, That midst the Crowd of my own innate Sorrows, Some Comfort gleams, that I have done this Justice To Honour, and to youâYour Honour safe From Violation; Death's a trivial nothing! Pray therefore rise,âAnd know I mention Death, Lest you should cherish a vain HopeâMy Pity Would save your Lives, as it has done your Chastity; But that's impossible, tho' I wish it were not; Your House's Ruin, being decreed by Fate, And th'impetuous Crowdâall sworn your Enemies. Amid. We cannot, must not, hope it. Gilm. No, being freed from lustful Villainy, By your angelick Virtue, best of Women, I will meet Death, with better Resolution Than ever yet I did a vicious Pleasure In my curst Days of Riot. Beliz. Bravely said, Oh, be assur'd, had I the Power to save ye, Spite of the Sweets, 'tis said there are in Vengeance, Each Hair that now is growing on your Heads Should turn with Age to Silver, but it cannot be; Your Race are all proscrib'd, and you must die. Amid. The Gods allot us Patience. [Embracing her. Gilm. Courage, dear Sister. Oh let the Arms of a new Convert press thee Close to my Breast, with Amity unfeign'd, And beg thy Pardon for all past Remissness! Some Grace is yet for me; for now, methinks, The Gods inspire me to assist thy Weakness, To stem this Gulph of Fate. Beliz. Pass it o'er nobly. And prove how far your Souls surmount the Vulgar; Remember you're the Daughters of a King, Which, if confirm'd by your last Scene of Bravery, I yet engage your Persons shall be safe From Violation of unhallow'd Eyes; Nor shall your limbs be mangled, as intended, But laid to rest within your silent Tombs; With all Respect to virgin Innocence. Gil. Oh heavenly Breath! Amid. Oh, the good Gods reward ye! [Both kneeling and embrace her. Beliz. And since the Sheers of Fate cuts off all Passions, And with the Brave concludes Revenge and Hatred, Look on me calmly, as a parting Friend, That, in the Crisis of your last Extremity, Gives ye two signal Tokens of her Love. First this, [Kisses them. with pitying Tears for your hard Fortune. A present from my Love,âthen this [Gives Gilm. a Dagger. from Honour. A Charm to save ye from insulting Cruelty. Use it, ye Royal Victims, as become ye; Then fall renown'd, and peace eternal crown ye. [Exit. Gilm. She's gone, whilst thus bestow'd, her fatal Present I grasp, with an undaunted Resolution. Oh, what a world of Wealth had I possession! Would I have giv'n some Minutes since for this, Which now my Guardian Genius offers me: For thisâWhat's this?âA Dagger: What's its Office? Why, 'tis to make eternal Separation 'Twixt Soul and Body, with one noble Blow; That's all, and so to free us from Distress, And put an end to Life's Inquietudes; Yet see, how Nature shakes at the dire Motion. Oh Coward! would'st thou still be miserable? Here is the World, and here Eternity; What a vast Freight of Hopes, and Fears, and Doubts, Troubles and Joys float on that stormy Sea, Which yet we're sure in th'end must swallow all? Courage, my Soul, and Dagger hold thy Sharpness! This Strife shall soon be finish'd; come, dear Sister, Too late belov'd, but now, my Heart's, sole Joy, Look up, and see my Life Blood make thee Recompense. Amid. Oh hold! for since you're now so good to love me, See me die first. Alas! I'm all o'er Coward, And tremble so, that did you not assist me, I fear I should not strike the Blow to free me. Let me then use the Dagger in your Presence. Gilm. The Aid thou hast from sacred Innocence Will make thee bold, and charm thee with new Courage: Besides, it is my Birthright, I'm the elder, And should die first. Amid. Oh! having more of Years, You have the more of Courage; simple Tenderness Will make me swoon when I behold you die; And leave my Body senseless to be sham'd By some vile Ruffian: Oh pity me, dear Sister, And shew me how to strike! Gilm. Hah! she has mov'd me [Apart from her. With her last WordsâSee how the poor Soul trembles, Like a weak callow Bird, torn from its Nest, That knows not where to get new Habitation. Her Fears will certainly evade the Stroke, And leave her to Abusesâ'Tis resolv'd then. Well, Amidea, you shall conquer me; Give me first, one dear Sister-like Embrace, And a kind Pardon for my past Offences. And then, sweet Soul, farewel. [They embrace. Oh Tyrant Destiny! Now take the Dagger, and one happy Blow, Struck home like this, [Stabs Amidea. seats thee among the Stars. Amid. Ah, 'tis done, 'tis done, dear Sister, blest be thy Hand: Kiss me, and take my last Thanks; Oh!âFarewel. [Dies. Gilm. The last of rosy Breath, came coldly to me, [Kissing her. A second blow: And thus I give thee mine. [Stabs her self. Adieu, vain Life, thou childish Bubble, blown A while about the World, flasht off, and gone. [Dies. SCENE III. Discovers the Heads of Aristander and Cilon held by Soldiers on Spears, with their Limbs torn off, and held by others; who stand on each side of Damocles; who appears impal'd upon a Stake, on the side of the Stage; the Bodies of Clorona and Clindor lying in State, Timoleon sitting by it, holding Belizaria's Hand, Pollidamus, Gomond, Helmige, Ladies and Guards standing round 'em. Timol. 'Tis now my Peace of Mind is perfected, And dear Revenge is full; the Fate of Tyranny At large is prov'd; rest then, sweet Souls, for ever; And thou, my better half, live long and happy: 'Twill be the greatest of my Joys above, To look down, and beholdâVirtue rewarded. Beliz. Ah, what Reward, dear Lord, whilst you are in Danger, And this lov'd part is gone, [Pointing to Clindor. can Belizaria Expect or hope for? Oh relentless Powers! This last worst Blow, has fal'n on me unguarded. [Weeps. Gomond. Hope better, Madam,âThe Surgeon's last Account made of his Lordship's Wound is favourable. Timol. Where's Demetrius? Pollid. The Prince, my Lord, went out in eager Haste, having your Grant, and the great Governour's, in hopes to save the Princesses, but the People oppos'd it, through their Hate to Aristander, even to the lastâand see his Highness comes. Enter Demetrius with a Dagger. Demet. Fate has been now too speedy, they're both dead, And by themselves, with this: [A Dagger. Poor Amidea, thy Virtue Well deserved Pity, tho' it late was likely To prove my Ruine. Beliz. Oh Royal Virgins! you have nobly paid Bright Honour's Debt.âThe Dagger's mine, my Lord, Which was but lent to do that glorious Office; As I, for the same Use, had long reserv'd it, Whenever my Distress gave an occasion; Please to return it, that it may be hallow'd, And kept up as a Relick to Posterity. Demet. Madam, I'll not dispute your Pleasure. [Gives the Dagger. How fares my noble Father? Timol. Like one that holds his Soul betwixt his Lips, Only to give some tender Friend a Farewel. Royal young Man! Heaven shower down Blessings on thee, Make ready there, all you that love Timoleon, To give a Shout, and cry, Long live Demetrius, Now rightful King of Corinth. Pollid. Allow'd by all, with general Joy, my Lord. Zizimo. His Spirits faulter, and his Face grows paler; Raise him a little. Timol. If there were ought remaining of a Blessing Which I had not bestow'd, thou Soul of Goodness, [To Belizaria. Pattern of Heroines, and peerless Wife, With my last Gasp I'd give it.âBut 'tis over; The Life Love's Cordial kept so long, decays, I've now no more Space, nor no more Breath to praise. [Swoons. Demet. He Swoons, remove him to more Air. Beliz. Nor I a Soul, now thine has left its Body. [Timol. is carry'd off. Pollid. Keep back the Lady, her Grief will more disturb him. [She is going after him, they stop her. Beliz. Oh cruel Powers! are these then the Rewards, The Comforts ye receive for patient Virtue, To feel the utmost Pangs of Wretchedness! Gomon. 'Tis but a Swooning, Madam, he'll soon recover. Beliz. My Brain grows hot, distemper'd Reason faulters At this mysterious point of Resignation; And when I look on those heart-breaking Objects, The Chain of Sense is broke, distracting Sorrow Turns me to Rage; [Looks after Timoleon. stand off, for he that touches me [Lifts up the Dagger, the Prince offers to take hold of her. Fixes this here.âGive then just Passion way, Oh, my lov'd Hero! [Looks after Timoleon. Have then all thy Actions, Refin'd by Honour still, and sacred Virtue, Acquir'd no Doom but this, this dangerous Tryal. But thou, my tenderest Nerve, [Looks after Timoleon. my Soul's chief Joy, [Takes up Clindor. And Life, Blood of my Heart, how has thy Innocence, That equaliz'd the Purity of Angels, Deserv'd this Fate? Oh, let me bury thee [Kissing him eagerly. Here in my Bosom! Let thy Mother's Body Be thy last Tomb, in which it first was nourish'd! What! what! ye Gods, will ye not grant me this To reconcile me! Oh! but you'll say we're taught, Our Comforts are hereafter,â'tis well thought on. [Lays him down again. To purchase then the Joy hereafter promises, And rid my Soul from its vast Load of Woes; Besides, to meet my Husband and dear Son, This post me to the Place where they are gone. [Stabs her self. Forgive, ye Gods, you should, if now I err: Have giv'n less Grief, or else more Strength to bear. Helm. Oh, she is lost! [Shrieking. Demet. Fatal and sudden. Gomon. Not fatal, I hope, Sir, the Wound, by chance, is slaunting. Enter Zizimo hastily. Zizimo. Madam, the noble General recover'd from his Fit, wishes to see you. Beliz. Oh Heaven, can this be possible? [She is carry'd off. Demet. Take great Care, good Gomond, To hasten Art to give her Remedy. Come, Pollidamus, Let's leave this Scene of Death, and to the People, With kind Oration, settle our new Royalty; Pull down the Fabrick of ill Government, And found one upon Justice, Truth, and Honour; Whilst all good Subjects, glorying in their Change, Reflect on Ills, from Tyranny did grow, And bless the happy Revolution now. End of the Tragedy.</field>
