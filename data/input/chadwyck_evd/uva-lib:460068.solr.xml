      <field name="fulltext">BUSIRIS, KING of EGYPT. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">O triste plane acerbumq; Funus! O Morte ipsâ Mortis Tempus indignius! Jam destinata erat egregio Juveni, Jam electus Nuptiarum Dies; Quod Gaudium, Quo mœrore mutatum est? Plin. Epist.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To His Grace the Duke of Newcastle, Lord-Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, By a Friend. Spoken by Mr. Booth. Long have you seen the Greek and Roman Name, Assisted by the Muse, renew their Fame: While yet unsung those Heroes sleep, from whom Greece form'd her Plato's, and her Cæsar's Rome. Such, Egypt, were thy Sons! Divinely Great In Arts, and Arms, in Wisdom, and in State. Her early Monarchs gave such Glories Birth, Their Ruins are the Wonders of the Earth. Structures so Vast by those Great Kings design'd, Are but faint Sketches of their boundless Mind: Yet ne'er has Albion's Scene, though long renown'd, With the stern Tyrants of the Nile been crown'd. The Tragic Muse in Grandeur shou'd excell, Her Figure blazes, and her Numbers swell. The proudest Monarch of the proudest Age, From Egypt comes to tread the British Stage: Old Homer's Heroes Moderns are to those Whom this Night's Venerable Scenes disclose. Here Pomp and Splendor serve but to prepare; To touch the Soul is our peculiar Care; By just Distress soft Pity to impart, And mend your Nature, while we move your Heart; Nor wou'd these Scenes in empty Words abound, Or overlay the Sentiment with Sound. Words (when the Poet wou'd your Souls engage) Are the meer Garnish of an Idle Stage. When Passion rages, Eloquence is mean; Gestures and Looks best speak the Moving Scene. Ye shining Fair! when tender Woes invite To pleasing Anguish, and severe Delight, By your Affliction you compute your Gain, And rise in Pleasure, as you rise in Pain. If then just Objects of Concern are shown, And your Hearts heave with Sorrows not your own, Let not the generous Impulse be withstood, Strive not with Nature, blush not to be Good: Sighs only from a Noble Temper rise, And 'tis your Virtue swells into your Eyes.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SCENE A Temple in Memphis. Enter Pheron and Syphoces. SYPHOCES. If Glorious Structures, and Immortal Deeds Enlarge the Thought, and set our Souls on Fire, My Tongue has been too Cold in Egypt's Praise, The Queen of Nations, and the Boast of Times, Mother of Science, and the House of Gods! Scarce can I open wide my Labouring Mind To comprehend the vast Idea, big With Arts and Arms, so Boundless in their Fame. Pher. Thrice happy Land! did not her dreadful King, Far-fam'd Busiris, whom the World reveres, Lay all his shining Wonders in Disgrace, By Cruelty and Pride. Syph. By pride indeed; He calls himself the Proud, and Glories in it, Nor would Exchange for Jupiter's Almighty. Have we not seen him shake his Silver Reins O'er Harness'd Monarchs, to his Chariot yok'd? In sullen Majesty they stalk along, With Eyes of Indignation, and Despair, While He aloft displays his impious State, With half their rifled Kingdoms o'er his Brow, Blazing to Heaven in Diamond, and Gold. Pher. Nor less the Tyrant's Cruelty, than Pride; His horrid Altars stream with Human Blood, And Piety is Murder in His Hand. [A great Shout. Syph. There rose the Voice of twice two hundred thousand, And broke the Clouds, and clear'd the Face of Day: The King, who from This Temple's airy Height, With Heart dilated that great Work surveys, Which shall proclaim What can be done by Man, Has struck his Purple Streamer, and descends. Pher. Twice ten long Years have seen that haughty Pile, Which Nations with united Toil advance, Gain on the Skies, and labour up to Heaven. Syph. The King—or prostrate fall, or disappear. [Exeunt. Enter Busiris attended. Bus. This ancient City, Memphis the Renown'd, Almost Coæval with the Sun himself, And boasting Strength scarce sooner to decay, How wanton sits she amid Nature's Smiles, Nor from her highest Turret has to view, But Golden Landskips, and Luxuriant Scenes, A Waste of Wealth, the Storehouse of the World! Here, fruitful Vales far-stretching fly the Sight, There, Sails unnumber'd whiten all the Stream, While from the Banks full twenty Thousand Cities Survey their Pride, and see their gilded Tow'rs Float on the Waves, and break against the Shore: To crown the Whole, this rising Pyramid [Shews the Plan. Lengthens in Air, and ends among the Stars, While every other Object shrinks beneath Its mighty Shade, and lessens to the View, As Kings compar'd with me. Enter Auletes, he falls prostrate. Aul. O live for ever, Busiris, first of Men! Bus. Auletes, rise. Aul. Ambassadors from various Climes arrive, To view your Wonders, and to greet your Fame; Each loaden with the Gifts his Country yields, Of which the meanest rise to Gold, and Pearl: The rich Arabian fills his ample Vase With sacred Incense; Ethiopia sends A thousand Coursers fleeter than the Wind; And their black Riders darken all the Plain: Camels and Elephants from other Realms, Bending beneath a Weight of Luxury, Bring the best Seasons of their various Years, And leave their Monarchs poor. Bus. What from the Persian? Aul. He bends before your Throne, and far out-weighs The rest in Tribute, and out-shines in State. Bus. Away, he sees me not, I know his Purpose, A Spy upon my Greatness, and no Friend: Take his Ambassador, and shew him Egypt, In Memphis shew him various Nations met, As in a Sea, yet not confin'd in Space, But streaming freely thro' the spacious Streets, Which send forth Millions at each Brazen Gate, When-e'er the Trumpet calls; high over head On the broad Walls the Chariots bound along, And leave in Air a Thunder of my own: Jove too has pour'd the Nile into my Hand, The Prince of Rivers, Ocean's eldest Son: Rich of my Self, I make the Fruitful Year, Nor ask precarious Plenty from the Sky— Throw all my Glories open to his View, Then tell him, in Return for Trifles offer'd, I give him This; and when a Persian Arm [Gives him a Bow. Can Thus with Vigour its Reluctance bend, And to the Nerve its stubborn Force subdue; Then let his Master think of Arms—but bring More Men than yet e'er pour'd into the Field; Mean time, thank Heav'n, our Tide of Conquest drives A different way, and leaves him still a King: This to the Persian—I receive the rest, And give the World an Answer. [Ex. Busiris. Mandane, attended by Priests and her Virgins, is seen Sacrificing at a Distance. A Hymn to Isis is sung, the Priests go out. Mandane, attended by her Maids, advances. Mand. My Morning Duty to the Gods is over, Yet still this Terror hangs upon my Soul, And saddens every Thought—I still behold The dreadful Image, still the threat'ning Sword Points at my Breast, and glitters in mine Eye.— But 'twas a Dream, no more. My Virgins, leave me. And thou Great Ruler of the World be present! O kindly shine on this important Hour! This Hour determines all my Future Life, And gives it up to Misery, or Joy. [She advances. These lonely Walks, this deep, and solemn Gloom, Where Noon-day Suns but glimmer to the View, This House of Tears, and Mansion of the Dead, For ever hides him from the hated Light, And gives him Leave to groan. Back Scene draws, and shews Memnon leaning on his Father's Tomb. Was ever Scene So mournful! If, my Lord, the Dead alone Are all your Care, Life is no more a Blessing. How cou'd you shun me for this dismal Shade, And seek from Love a Refuge in Despair? Mem. Why hast thou brought those Eyes to this sad Place, Where Darkness dwells, and Grief wou'd sigh secure, In welcome Horrors, and beloved Night? Thy Beauties drive the friendly Shades before them, And Light up Day even here. Retire, my Love, Each joyful Moment I would share with thee, My virtuous Maid, but I wou'd mourn alone. Man. What have you found in me so mean, to hope That while you sigh my Soul can be at Peace? Your Sorrows flow from your Mandane's Eyes. Mem. Oh my Mandane!— Man. Wherefore turn you from me? Have I Offended, or are you Unkind? Ah me! A Sight as strange, as pitiful! From his big Heart, o'ercharg'd with gen'rous Sorrow, See the Tide working upward to his Eye, And stealing from him in large silent Drops, Without his Leave!—can those Tears flow in vain? Mem. Why will you double my Distress, and make My Grief my Crime, by discomposing you?— And yet I can't forbear! Alas! my Father! That Name excuses all; what is not due To that Great Name, which Life or Death can pay? Mand. Speak on, and ease your labouring Breast, it swells, And sinks again, and then it swells so high, It looks as it wou'd break. I know 'tis big With something you wou'd utter. Oft in vain I have presum'd to ask your mournful Story; But ever have been answer'd with a Frown. Mem. Oh my Mandane! did my Tale concern My self alone, it wou'd not lye conceal'd; But 'tis wrapt up in Guilt, in Royal Guilt, And therefore 'tis unsafe to touch upon it. To tell my Tale, is to blow off the Ashes From sleeping Embers, which will rise in Flames At the least Breath, and spread Destruction round. But thou art faithful, and my other self; And oh! my Heart this Moment is so full It bursts with its Complaint; and I must speak. Myris the present Queen, was only Sister Of Great Artaxes, our late Royal Lord: Busiris, who now Reigns, was first of Males In Lineal Blood, to which this Crown descends. (Not with long Circumstance to load my Story) Ambitious Myris fir'd his daring Soul, And turn'd his Sword against her Brother's Life: Then mounting to the Tyrant's Bed and Throne, Enjoy'd her Shame, and triumph'd in her Guilt. Mand. So black a Story well might shun the Day. Mem. Artaxes' Friends (a virtuous Multitude) Were swept away by Banishment, or Death In Throngs, and sated the devouring Grave. My Father.—Think, Mandane, on your own, And pardon me!— [Weeps The Tyrant took me, then of tender Years, And rear'd me with his Son, (a Son since dead) He vainly hop'd, by Shews of guilty Kindness, To wear away the Blackness of his Crime, And reconcile me to my Father's Fate; Hence have I long been forc'd to stay my Vengeance, To smooth my Brow with Smiles, and curb my Tongue, While the big Woe lies throbbing at my Heart.— Enter Pheron at a Distance. Pher. So close! so loving! here I stand unseen, And watch my Rival's Fate. [Aside. Mem. But thou my Fair, Thou art my Peace in Tumult, Life in Death, Thou yet can'st make me blest. Mand. As how, my Lord? Mem. Ah, why wilt thou insult me? Mand. Memnon.— Mem. Speak. Mand. Nature forbids, and when I wou'd begin, She stifles all my Spirits, and I faint: My Heart is breaking, but I cannot speak. Oh let me fly.— Mem. You pierce me to the Soul. [Holding her. Mand. Oh! spare me for a Moment, till my Heart Regains its wonted Force; and I will speak.— Pheron, you know, is daily urgent with me, Breaks thro' Restraints, and will not be refus'd. [Pheron shews a great Concern. Yet more the Prince, the young impetuous Prince, Before his Father sent him forth to War, And gave the Mede to his destructive Sword, Has often taught his Tongue a silken Tale, Descended from himself, and talk'd of Love, Since last I saw thee, his licentious Passion Has haunted all my Dreams.— This Day the Court shines forth in all its Lustre, To welcome her returning Warrior home; Alas the Malice of our Stars! Mem. To place it Beyond the Power of Fate to part our Loves; Be this our Bridal Night, my Life!—My Soul! [Emb. Pher. Perdition seize them both! and have I lov'd So long, to catch her in another's Arms! Another's Arms for ever! Oh the Pang!— Heart-piercing Sight!—but Rage shall take its Turn, It shall be so—and let the Crime be His Who drives me to the black Extremity; I fear no farther Hell than that I feel. [Exit. Mem. Trembling I grasp thee, and my anxious Heart Is still in doubt if I may call thee Mine. Oh Bliss too great! Oh painful Extasie! I know not what to utter. Mand. Ah my Lord! What means this Damp, that comes athwart my Joy, Chastising thus the Lightness of my Heart?— I have a Father, and a Father too Tender as Nature ever fram'd.—His Will Should be consulted.—Should I touch his Peace, I should be wretched in my Memnon's Arms. Mem. Talk not of Wretchedness. Mand. Alas! this Day First gave me Birth, and (which is strange to tell) The Fates e'er since, as watching its Return, Have caught it as it flew, and mark'd it deep With something Great, Extremes of Good or Ill. Mem. Why should we bode Misfortune to our Loves? No, I receive thee from the Gods, in lieu Of all that Happiness they ravish'd from me; Fame, Freedom, Father, All return in thee. Had not the Gods Mandane to bestow, They never would have pour'd such Vengeance on me; They meant me thee, and could not be severe. Soon as Night's favourable Shades descend, The Holy Priest shall joyn our Hands for ever, And Life shall prove but one long Bridal-Day. Till then, in Scenes of Pleasure lose thy Grief, Or strike the Lute, or smile among the Flowers, They'll sweeter smell, and fairer bloom for Thee.— Alas! I'm torn from this dear tender Side, By weighty Reasons, and important Calls, Nay even by Love it self—I quit Thee now, But to deserve thee more. [They embrace. Mand. Your Friends are here. [Exit Mand. Mem. Excellent Creature! how my Soul pants for thee?— But other Passions now begin their Claim, Doubt, and Disdain, and Sorrow, and Revenge, With mingling Tumult tear up All my Breast: Oh how unlike the Softnesses of Love! Enter Syphoces. Syph. Hail, worthy Memnon. Mem. Welcome, my Syphoces. And much I hope thou bring'st a bleeding Heart; A Heart that bleeds for other's Miseries, Bravely regardless of its own, tho' great, That first of Characters. Syph. And there's a second, Not far behind, to rescue the Distress'd, Or Dye. Mem. Yes dye; and visit those brave Men, Who, from the first of Time, have bath'd their Hands In Tyrant's Blood, and grasp'd their honest Swords As Part of their own Being, when the Cause, The publick Cause demanded. Oh my Friend! How long shall Egypt groan in Chains? how long Shall her Sons fall in Heaps without a Foe? No War, Plague, Famine, Nothing but Busiris, His People's Father! and the State's Defence! Yet but a Remnant of the Land survives. Syph. What Havock have I seen? have we not known A Multitude become a Morning's Prey, When troubled Rest, or a Debauch has sowr'd The Monster's Temper? then 'tis instant Death; Then fall the Brave and Good, like ripen'd Corn Before the sweeping Scythe, not the poor Mercy To Starve, and Pine at Leisure in their Chains.— But what fresh Hope, that we receive your Summons To meet you here this Morning? Mem. Know, Syphoces, 'Twas on this Day my Warlike Father's Blood, So often lavish'd in his Country's Cause, And greatly sold for Conquest, and Renown; 'Twas on this execrable Day it flow'd On his own Pavement, in a peaceful Hour, Smoak'd in the Dust, and wash'd a Ruffian's Feet. This guilty Day returning, rouzes all My smother'd Rage, and blows it to a Flame. Where are our other Friends? Syph. At Hand. Rameses, Last Night when gentle Rest o'er Nature spread Her still Command, and Care alone was waking, Like a dumb, lonely, discontented Ghost, Enter'd my Chamber, and approach'd my Bed; With Bursts of Passion, and a Peal of Groans He recollects his Godlike Brother's Fate, The drunken Banquet, and the midnight Murder, And urges Vengeance on the guilty Prince. Such was the Fellness of his boiling Rage, Methought the Night grew darker as he Frown'd. Mem. I know he bears the Prince most deadly Hate; But this will enter deeper in his Soul, [Shews a Letter. And rouze up Passions, which till now have slept: Murder will look like Innocence to This. Syph. How, Memnon? Mem. This reminds me of thy Fate; The Queen has courted thee with proffer'd Realms, And sought by Threats to bend thee to her Will; She languishes, she burns, she wastes away In fruitless Hopes, and dies upon thy Name. Syph. Oh fatal Love! which stung by Jealousie, Expell'd a Life far dearer than my own By cursed Poyson—Ah Divine Apame! And cou'd the Murdress hope she shou'd inherit This Heart, and fill thy Place within these Arms?— But Grief shall yield—Revenge, I'm wholly thine. Mem. The Tyrant too is wanton in his Age, He shews that all his Thoughts are not in Blood; Love claims its share; he envies poor Rameses The Softness of his Bed; and thinks Amelia A Mistress worthy of a Monarch's Arms. Syph. But see, Rameses comes, a sullen Gloom Scowls on his Brow, and marks him through the Dusk. Enter Rameses, Pheron, and other Conspirators. Mem. To what, my Friends, shall Memnon bid you Welcome? To Tombs, and melancholy Scenes of Death? I have no costly Banquets, such as spread Prince Myron's Table, when your Brother fell. [To Ram. I have no gilded Roof, no gay Apartment, Such as the Queen prepar'd for thee, Syphoces. Yet be not discontent, my valiant Friends, Busiris reigns, and 'tis not out of Season To look on ought may mind us of our Fate: His Sword is ever drawn, and furious Myris Thinks the Day lost that is not mark'd with Blood. Ram. And have we felt a Tyrant twenty Years, Felt him, as the raw Wound the burning Steel, And are we murmuring out our Midnight Curses, Drying our Tears in Corners, and Complaining? Our Hands are forfeited. Gods! Strike them off. No Hands we need to fasten our own Chains, Our Masters will do that; and we want Souls To raise them to an Use more worthy Men. Mem. Ruffles your Temper at Offences past! Here then, to sting thee into Madness. [Gives the Letter. Rameses reads. Ram. Oh! Syph. See how the struggling Passions shake his Frame! Ram. My Bosom Joy, that crowns my happy Bed With tender Pledges of our mutual Love, Far dearer than my Soul! and shall my Wife, The Mother of my little Innocents, Be taken from us! Torn from me! from mine! Who live but on her sight! and shall I hear Her Cries for Succour, and not rush upon him? My Infant hanging at the Neck upbraids me, And struggles with his little Arms to save her.— These Veins have still some generous Blood in store, The Dregs of those rich Streams his Wars have drain'd; I'll give't in Dowry with her. Pher. Well resolv'd: A tardy Vengeance shares the Tyrant's Guilt. Ram. Let me embrace thee, Pheron, Thou art brave, And dost disdain the Coldness of Delay. Curse on the Man that calls Rameses Friend, And keeps his Temper at a Tale like this; When Rage and Rancor are the proper Virtues, And Loss of Reason is the Mark of Men. Mem. Thus I've determin'd; when the Midnight Hour Lulls this proud City, and her Monarch dreams Of humbled Foes, or his new Mistress' Love, Then we will rush at once, let loose the Terrors Of Rage pent in, and struggling twenty Years To find a vent, and at one dreadful Blow Begin, and end the War. A more Auspicious Juncture cou'd not happen. The Persian, who for Years has join'd our Counsels, Stir'd up the Love of Freedom, and in private Long nurs'd the glorious Appetite with Gold, This Morn with Transport snatch'd the wish'd Occasion Of throwing his Resentment wide, and now He Frowns in Arms, and gives th'Event to Fate. Ram. This Hand shall drag the Tyrant from his Throne, And stab the Royal Victim on This Altar. [Pointing to the Tomb. Mem. Oh justly thought! Friends, cast your Eyes around, All that most Awful is, or Great in Nature, This solemn Scene presents; the Gods are Here, And Here our fam'd Forefathers sacred Tombs; Who never brook'd a Tyrant in this Land. Let us not Act beneath the Grand Assembly! The slighted Altars tremble, and these Tombs Send forth a Peal of Groans to urge us on. Come then, surround my Father's Monument, And call his Shade to Witness to your Vows. Ram. Nor his alone. Oh all ye mighty Dead! Illustrious Shades! Who nightly stalk around The Tyrant's Couch, and shake his guilty Soul: Whether already you converse with Gods, Or stray below in melancholy Glooms, From Earth, from Air, from Heaven, and from Hell, Come, I conjure you, by the Prisoner's Chain, The Widow's Sighing, and the Orphan's Tears, The Virgin's Shrieks, the Heroe's spouting Veins, By Gods blasphem'd, and Free-born Men enslav'd. Mem. Hear, Jove, and you most injur'd Heroes, hear, While we o'er this thrice hallow'd Monument Thus join our Hands, and kneeling to the Gods, Fast bind our Souls to great Revenge! All. We Swear— Mem. This Night the Tyrant and his Minions bleed, And Flames shall lay those Palaces in Dust, Whose gilded Domes now glitter in the Sun. Pher. So now, my Foe is taken in the Toil, And I've a second Cast for this proud Maid— It is an Oath well spent, a Perjury Of good Account in Vengeance, and in Love. [Aside. Mem. We wrong the mighty Dead, if we permit Our Eyes alone to count this grand Assembly, A thousand unseen Heroes walk among us, My Father rises from his Tomb, his Wounds Bleed all afresh, and Consecrate the Day; He waves his Arm, and chides our tardy Vengeance. More than this World shall thank us. O my Friends! Such our Condition, we have nought to lose, And great may be our Gain, if this be great, To crush a Tyrant, and preserve a State. To still the Clamours of our Father's Blood, To fix the Basis of the Publick Good, To leave a Fame Eternal, then to soar, Mix with the Gods, and bid the World adore.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. SCENE The Palace. A Magnificent Throne discovered, and several Courtiers walking to and fro. Enter Syphoces and Rameses. Shouts at a Distance. Ram. What means this Dust, and Tumult in the Court, These Streamers fooling in the Wind, these Shouts, The Tyrant blazing in full Insolence, And all his gawdy Courtiers basking round him, Like poysonous Vermin in a Dog-day Sun? Syph. Your Father and Prince Myron are arriv'd, And with one Peal of Joy the Nation rings. Ram. Long has my Father serv'd this Tyrant King, With Zeal well worthy of a better Cause; Though with his Helm he hides a hoary Brow, Long vers'd in Death, the Father of the Field, At the shrill Trumpet, he throws off the Weight Of fourscore Years, and springs upon the Foe. The Transport, Danger gives him, conquers Nature, And a short Youth boils up within his Veins. Syph. Behold, this way They pass to meet the King. Myron and Nicanor pass the Stage with Attendants. Ram. What Pity 'tis that one so lost in Guilt, Should thus engage the Sight with manly Charms, And make Vice lovely? [Looking on Myron. Syph. Pardon me, Rameses: Though to my Foe, I must be ever just. He's Generous, Grateful, Affable, and Brave: But then he knows no Limit to his Passion; The Tempest-beaten Bark is not so toss'd, As is his Reason, when those Winds arise: And tho' he draws a fatal Sword in Battle, And kindles in the warm Pursuit of Fame, Pleasure subdues him quite, the sparkling Eye, And generous Bowl bear down his graver Mind, While fiery Spirits dance along his Veins, And keep a constant Revel in his Heart. Ram. But hear, the Tyrant comes!—with what Excess Of idle Pride will he receive his Son? How with big Words will he swell out this Conquest, And into Grandeur puff his little Tales. Enter King, and ascends the Throne; on the other side Enter Myron and Nicanor. King. Welcome my Son, great Partner of my Fame, I thank thee for th'Increase of my Dominions, That now more Mountains rise, more Rivers flow, And more Stars shine in my still growing Empire. The Sun himself surveys it not at once, But travels for the View, whilst far disjoin'd, My Subjects live unheard of by each other; These wrap'd in Shades, while those enjoy the Light Their Day is various, but their King the same. Myr. Here, Sir, your Thanks are due; to this old Arm Whose Nerves not Threescore Winter Camp unbend You owe your Victory, and I my Life. When my fierce Courser, with a Javelin stung, First rear'd in Air, then tearing with a Bound The trembling Earth, plung'd deep amidst the Foe; And now a Thousand Deaths from every Side, Had but one Mark, and on my Buckler rung; Through the throng'd Legions like a Tempest rush'd This Friend, o'er gasping Heroes, rolling Steeds, And snatch'd me from my Fate. Bus. I thank thee, General, Thou hast a Heart that swells with Loyalty, And throws off the Infection of these Times; But thy degenerate Boy— Nic. No more my Son, I cut him off, my Guilt, my Punishment. Look not, dread Sir, on me through his Offence; Oh let not that discolour all my Service, And ruin those who blame him for his Crime! Bus. Old Man, I will not wear the Crown in vain, Subjects shall work my Will, or feel my Pow'r, Their Disobedience shall not be my Guilt; Who is their Welfare, Glory, and Defence? The Land that yields them Food, and every Stream That slakes their Thirst, the Air they breath is Mine. And is Concurrence to their own Enjoyment, By due Submission, a too great Return? Death and Destruction are within my Call— But Thou shalt flourish in thy Master's Smile. A faithful Minister adorns my Crown, And throws a brighter Glory round my Brow. Nic. Take but one more, one small one to your Favour, And then my Soul's at Peace—I have a Daughter, An only Daughter, now an only Child, Since her lost Brother's Folly; she deserves The most a Father can for so much Goodness: Her Mother's dead, and we are left alone, We Two are the Whole House, nor are we Two, In her I live, the Comfort of my Age; And if the King extend his Grace so far, And take that tender Blossom into shelter, Then I have all my Monarch can bestow, Or Heav'n it self, but This, that I may wear My Life's poor Remnant out in your Command; Stretch forth my Being to the last in Duty, And, when the Fates shall summon dye for you. Bus. Nicanor, know, thy Daughter is our Care. Myr. Oh, Sir, be greatly kind, exert your Pow'r, And with the Monarch furnish out the Friend!— Art thou not he, that Gallant-minded Chief, [To Nic. Who wou'd not stoop to give me less than Life? And shall I prove ungrateful? Shocking Thought! He that's ungrateful has no Guilt but one, All other Crimes may pass for Virtues in him. Nic. What Joy my Daughter's promis'd Welfare gives me, My Lips I need not open to discover— Thus humbly let me thank you. Bus. Dry thy Tears, And follow us; thy Daughter's near our Queen, And longs, no doubt, to see thee; bless the Maid, And then attend us on Affairs of State.— I hear there's Treason near us; though the Slaves Fall off from their Obedience, and deny That I'm their Monarch, I'm Busiris still. Collected in my self, I'll stand alone, And hurl my Thunder, tho' I shake my Throne: Like Death, a solitary King I'll reign, O'er silent Subjects, and a desert Plain; E'er brook their Pride; I'll spread a general Doom, And every Step shall be from Tomb to Tomb. [Exit [Myr. and Aul. who talk'd aside, advance. Myr. Her absent Beauties glow'd upon my Mind, And sparkled in each Thought. She never left me— Wou'dst thou believe it? In the Field of Battle, In the mid Terror, and the flame of Fight, Mandane, thou hast stol'n away my Soul, And left my Fame in Danger—My rais'd Arm Has hung in Air, forgetful to descend, And for a moment spar'd the prostrate Foe.— Oh that her Birth rose Equal to my own! Then I might wed with Honour, and enjoy A lawful Bliss—and why not now? Methinks Absence has plac'd her in a fairer Light, Enrich'd the Maid, and heighten'd every Charm. Aul. She comes. Myr. That modest Grace subdu'd my Soul, That Chastity of Look, which seems to hang A Veil of purest Light o'er all her Beauties, And by forbidding, most enflames Desire. Enter Mandane. What tender Force! What Dignity Divine! What Virtue consecrating every Feature! Around that Neck, what Dross are Gold and Pearl! Mandane! powerful Being! whose first Sight Gives me a Transport not to be express'd; And with one Moment over-pays a Year Of Danger, Toil, and Death, and Absence from Thee. Mand. My Lord, I sought my Father. Myr. Leave me not, I've much to say, much more than you conceive; Yes, by the Gods, much more than I can utter. My Breath is snatch'd, I tremble, I expire. [Aside. Nay, here I'll offer tender Violence— [Takes her Hand. May I not breath my Soul upon this Hand, When your Eyes triumph, and insult my Pain? Permit me here to take a small Revenge. Mand. My Lord, I am not conscious of my Fault. Myr. 'Tis false—I know the Language of those Eyes, They use me ill—see my Heart beat, Mandane; Believe not me, but tell your self my Passion— Is it in Art to Counterfeit within? To drive the Spirits, and inflame the Blood? Each Nerve is pierc'd with Lightning from your Eye, And every Pulse is in the Throbs of Love. Mand. My Lord, my Duty calls, I must not stay. Myr. Give me a Moment: I have that to speak Will burst me, if supprest—Oh heavenly Maid! Thy Charms are doubled; so is thy Disdain— Who is it? Tell me who enjoys thy Smile, There is a happy Man; I swear there is; I know it by your Coldness to your Friend— That Thought has fix'd a Scorpion on my Heart, That stings to Death—and is it possible You ever spoke of Myron in his Absence, Or cast, at leisure, a light Thought that way? Mand. I thought of you, my Lord, and of my Father; And pray'd for your Success; nor must I now Neglect to give him Joy. Myr. Yet stay, you shall not go—Ungrateful Woman! I wou'd not wrong your Father; but by Heav'n, His Love is Hatred, if compar'd with mine. I understand whence this Unkindness flows; Your Heart resents some Licence of my Youth, When Love had touch'd my Brain. You may forgive me, Because I never shall forgive my self; But that You live; I'd rush upon my Sword. If you forgive me, I shall now approach, Not as a Lover only, but a Wretch Redeem'd from Baseness to the ways of Honour, And to my Passion join my Gratitude: Each time I kneel before you, I shall rise As well a better, as a happier Man, Indebted to your Virtue, and your Love. Mand. I must not hear you. Myr. Oh torment me not! Hear me you must, and more—Your Father's Valour, In the late Battle, rescu'd me from Death: And how shall I be Grateful!—Thou'rt a Princess;— Think not, Mandane, this is a sudden start, A flash of Love, that kindles and expires: Long have I weigh'd it, since I parted hence No Night has pass'd, but This has broke my Rest, And mix'd with every Dream. My Fair, I wed Thee In the maturest Counsel of my Soul. Mand. Oh Gods! I tremble at the rising Storm; Where can this end? [Aside. Myr. And do you then despise me? Mand. My Lord, I want the Courage to accept What far transcends my Merit, and for ever Must silently upbraid my little Worth. Myr. Have I forsook my self, forgone my Temper Headlong to all the gay Delights of Youth, And fall'n in Love with Virtue most severe? Turn'd superstitious to make Thee my Friend? Gods! have I struggled thro' the powerful Reasons That strongly combated my fond Resolves; Was Wealth o'erlook'd, and Glory of no Weight, My Parent's Crown forgot, and my own Conquests, And all, to be refus'd? to sooth your Pride, And make my Rival Sport? Mand. With Patience hear me— [Kneels. Nor let my Trust in Myron prove my Ruin. Myr. Distraction! Art thou marry'd? Mand. Oh!— Myr. My Heart foretold it.—Ah my Soul! Auletes. [Swoons. Aul. Madam, 'tis prudent in you to withdraw— [Exit Mand. Myr. I do not live.—I cannot bear the Light! Where is Mandane? But I would not know. She is not mine.—Yet tho' not mine in Love, Revenge, my just Revenge may overtake her. Oh how I hate her! let me know her Faults: Did the proud Maid insult me in Distress? And smile to see me gasping? speak Auletes. Did she not sigh? sure she might pity me, Though all her Love is now another's Right. Aul. She sigh'd, and wept; but I remov'd her from you. Myr. It was well done.—Yet I cou'd gaze for ever And did she sigh? and did she drop a Tear? The Tears she shed for me are surely mine; And shall another dry them on those Cheeks, And make them an Excuse for greater Fondness? Shall I assist the Villain in his Joys? No, I will tear her from him,— I'd grudge her Beauties to the Gods that gave them. Aul. My Lord, have Temper. Myr. And another's Passion, Warm on that Lip! another's burning Arms Strain'd round the lovely Waste, for which I dye, And she consenting, wooing, growing to him! What golden Scenes, when absent, did I feign? What lovely Pictures did I draw in Air? What Luxury of Thought! and see my Fate! Shall then my Slave enjoy her? and I languish In my triumphal Carr, my Foot on Purple, And o'er my Head a Canopy of Gold, Fate in my Nod, and Monarchs in my Train! What if I stab him? No.—She will not wed His Murtherer.—I never form'd a Wish, But full Fruition taught me to forget it. And am I lessen'd by my late Success? And have I lost by Conquest? fly Auletes, And tell her.— Aul. What, my Lord? Myr. No, bid her— Aul. Speak. Myr. I know not what.—My Heart is torn asunder. Aul. Retire, my Lord, and re-compose your self, The Queen approaches.—Ha! her Bosom swells, [Exit Myron. Her pale Lip trembles, a disorder'd Haste Is in her Steps; her Eyes shoot gloomy Fires.— When Myris is in Anger, happy they She calls her Friends. Enter Queen. Queen. Auletes, where's the King? Aul. At Council, Madam. Queen. Let him know I want him. [Exit Auletes. Base! to forget to whom he owes a Crown! Fool! to provoke her Rage whose Hand is red In her own Brother's Blood! Enter King and Pheron. King. Horrid Conspiracy! Pher. This Night was destin'd for the bloody Deed. King. Mistaken Villains! if they wish my Death, They should in Prudence lay their Weapons by, So jealous are the Gods of Egypt's Glory, I cannot dye whilst Slaves are arm'd against me. Haste, Pheron, to the Dungeon, plunge them down Far from the Hopes of Day, there let them lye Banish'd this World. while yet alive, and groan In Darkness and in Horror,—let double Chains Consume the Flesh of Memnon's loaded Limbs, Till Death shall knock them off.—A King's thy Friend; Nay more, Busiris.—Go, let that suffice.— [Exit Pher. Queen. My Lord, your Thought's engag'd. King. Affairs of State Detain'd me from my Queen. Queen. The World may wait: I've a Request, my Lord. King. Oblige me with it. Queen. Will you comply? King. My Queen, my Pow'r is your's. Queen. Your Queen? King. My Queen. Queen. Indeed, it shou'd be so.— Then sign these Orders for Amelia's Death.— He starts, turns pale, He's sinking into Earth. Enough; be gone, and fling thee at her Feet; Doat on my Slave, and sue to her for Mercy. Go, pour forth all the Folly of thy Soul; But bear in Mind, thou giv'st not of thy own, Thou giv'st that Kindness which I bought with Blood, Nor shall I lose Unmov'd. King. I wish, my Queen, This still had slept a Secret for thy Sake; But since thy restless Jealousy of Soul Has been so studious of its own Disquiet; Support it, as you may.—I own I've felt Amelia's Charms, and think them worth my Love. Queen. And dar'st thou bravely own it too? Oh Insult! Forgetful Man! 'tis I then owe a Crown! Thou had'st still grovell'd in the lower World, And view'd a Throne at Distance; had not I Told thee thou wast a Man, and (dreadful Thought!) Thro' my own Brother cut thy Way to Empire: But thou might'st well forget a Crown bestow'd, That Gift was small. I listen'd to thy Sighs, And rais'd thee to my Bed. King. I thank you for it. The Gifts you made me were not cast away; I understand their Worth; Husband and King Are Names of no mean Import, they rise high Into Dominion, and are big with Power.— Whate'er I was, I now am King of Egypt, And Myris' Lord. Queen. I dream! art Thou Busiris? Busiris, that has trembled at my Feet, And art thou now my Jove with clouded Brow, Dispensing Fate, and looking down on Myris? Do'st thou derive thy Spirit from thy Crimes? 'Cause thou hast wrong'd me, therefore do'st thou threaten, And roll thine Eye in Anger? Rather bend, And sue for Pardon.—Oh detestable! Burn for a Stranger's Bed!— King. And what was mine, When Myris first vouchsaf'd to smile on me? Queen. Distraction! Death! upbraided for my Love!— Thou art not only Criminal, but Base. Mine was a Godlike Guilt, Ambition in it, Its Foot in Hell, its Head above the Clouds; For know, I hated when I most caress'd: 'Twas not Busiris, but the Crown that charm'd me, And sent its sparkling Glories to my Heart: But thou can'st soil thy Diadem with Slaves. King. Syphoces is a King then. Queen. Ha! King. Let fair Amelia know the King attends her. [Exit. Queen. Go, Tyrant, go, and wisely by thy Shame, Prepare thy Way to Ruin. I'll o'ertake thee, Living or dead; if dead, my Ghost shall rise, Shriek in thy Ears, and stalk before thy Eyes: In Death I'll triumph o'er my Rival's Charms, And chill thy Blood, when clasp'd within her Arms; Alone to suffer is beneath the Great. Tyrant, thy Torments shall support my State. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SCENE. The General's House. Enter the King. King. Here dwells my stubborn Fair, I'll sooth her Pride, And lay an humbled Monarch at her Feet. But let her well consider if she's slow To welcome Bliss, and dead to Glory's Charms, Then my Resentment rises in Proportion To this high Grace extended to my Slave, And turns the Force of her own Charms against her: Monarchs may Court, but cannot be Deny'd. Enter the Queen veiled. Amelia, dry thy Tears, and lay aside That melancholly Veil.—Ha, Myris! Queen. Myris. A Name that should like Thunder strike thine Ear, And make thee tremble in this guilty Place: But wherefore do'st thou think I meet thee here, Not with mean Sighs, and deprecating Tears To humble me before thee, and increase The Number of thy Slaves, in hope to break Thy Resolution, and avert thy Crime; But to denounce, if thou shalt dare persist, The Vengeance due to injur'd Heav'n, and me; And by this Warning double thy Offence: Think, think of Vengeance, 'tis the only Joy Which thou hast left me; I'm no more thy Wife, Nor Queen; but know, I am a Woman still. Enter Auletes. Aul. May all the Gods watch o'er your Life and Empire, And render Omens vain! so fierce the Storm, Old Memphis from her deep Foundations shakes, And such unheard-of Prodigies hang o'er us, As make the Boldest tremble: See the Moon Robb'd of her Light, discolour'd, without Form, Appears a bloody Sign, hung out by Jove To speak Peace broken with the Sons of Men: The Nile, as frighted, shrinks within its Banks, And as this Hour I past Great Isis' Temple, A sudden Flood of Light'ning rush'd upon it, And laid the Shrine in Ashes. King. Oh Mighty Isis! Why all these Signs in Nature? why this Tumult To tell me I am guilty? if my Crown The Fates demand, why let them take it back. My Crown indeed I may resign; but Oh! Who can awake the Dead?— 'Tis hence these Spectres shock my midnight Thoughts, And Nature's Laws are broke to discompose me; 'Tis I that whirl these Hurricanes in Air, And shake the Earth's Foundations with my Guilt. Oh Myris, give me back my Innocence! Queen. I bought it with an Empire. King. Cheaply sold! Why did'st thou urge my lifted Arm to strike The pious King, when my own Heart recoil'd? Queen. Why did you yield when urg'd, and by a Woman, You that are vain of your superior Reason, And swell with the Prerogative of Man? If you succeed, our Counsel is of nought; You own it, not accepted, though enjoy'd; But steal the Glory, and deny the Favour; Yet if a fatal Consequence attend, Then we're the Authors, then your treacherous Praise Allows us Sense enough to be condemn'd. King. 'Tis prudent to dissemble with her Fury, And wait a softer Season for my Love. [Aside. Bid Isis' Priests attend their King's Devotions, I'll sooth with Sacrifice the angry Pow'rs; Swift to my Dungeons, bid their darksome Wombs Give up the numerous Captives of my Wars, Ten thousand Lives to Heav'n devoutly pour, Nor let the sacred Knife grow cool from Blood, Till seven-fold Nile infected with the Stain, In all his Streams flows Purple to the Main. [Exit. Queen. Thin Artifice! I know the Sacrifice You most intend.—But I will dash your Joys; Thou, Victim, and thy Goddess both shall feel me. Aul. Madam, the Prince. Queen. And is he still afflicted? Aul. It grieves your faithful Servant to relate it; He struggles manfully; but all in vain; Sometimes he calls in Musick to his Aid, He strives with Martial Strains to fire his Blood, And rouze his Soul to Battle.— Then he relapses into Love again, Feeds the Disease, and doats upon his Ruin. Queen. Why seeks he here the Cause of all his Sorrows? Aul. He seeks not here Mandane, but her Father; For Friendship is the Balm of all our Cares, Melts in the Wound, and softens ev'ry Fate. [Martial Musick. Enter Myron at a distance. Queen. Heav'ns! what a Glory blazes from his Eye? What Force! what Majesty in every Motion, As at each Step he trod upon a Foe? Myr. O that this Ardor wou'd for ever last! It shall; nor will I curse my Being more; Chain'd Kings, and conquer'd Kingdoms are before me; I'll bend the Bow, and launch the whistling Spear, Bound o'er the Mountains, plunge into the Stream, Where thickest Fauchions gleam, and Helmets blaze, Rush in, and find Amusement from my Pain. I'll number my own Heart among my Foes, And Conquer it, or Dye. [Exit. Queen. The Thoughts of War Will soon dislodge the Fair One from his Breast— But this has broken in on my Intent— I wou'd remind thee of my late Commands. Aul. Madam, 'tis needless to remind your Slave: At dead of Night I set the Prisoners free. Queen. Yes, set the Prisoners free—'tis great Revenge, Such as my Soul pants after—It becomes me. Oh it will gall the Tyrant! Stab him home, And if one Spark of Gratitude survives, Soften Syphoces to my fond Desire. The Tyrant's Torment is my only Joy, Ye Gods! or let me Perish, or Destroy, Or rather both; for what has Life to boast When Vice is tastless grown, and Virtue lost? Glory and Wealth I call upon in vain, Nor Wealth, nor Glory can appease my Pain; My every Joy upbraids me with my Guilt, And Triumphs tell me sacred Blood is spilt. [Exit Queen. Enter Myron. Myr. The shining Images of War are fled, The fainting Trumpets languish in mine Ear, The Banner's furl'd, and all the sprightly Blaze Of burnish'd Armour, like the setting Sun, Insensibly is vanish'd from my Thought: No Battel, Siege, or Storm sustain my Soul In wonted Grandeur, and fill out my Breast; But Softness steals upon me, melting down My rugged Heart in Languishment and Sighs, And pours it out at my Mandane's Feet.— I see her even this Moment stand before me, Too Fair for Sight, and fatal to behold, I have her here, I clasp her in my Arms; And in the Madness of excessive Love Sigh out my Heart, and bleed with Tenderness. Aul. My Lord, too much you cherish this Delusion; She is another's. Myr. Do not tell me so. Say rather she is dead: Each heav'nly Charm Turn'd into Horror! Oh the Pain of Pains, Is when the Fair One, whom our Soul is fond of, Gives Transport, and receives it from another!— How does my Soul burn up with strong Desire, Now shrink into it self! Now blaze again! I'll tear and rend the Strings that tye me to her: If I stay longer here I am undone. As he is going, Enter Nicanor. Nic. My Prince, (and since such Honours you vouchsafe) My Friend, I have presum'd upon your Favour; This is my Daughter's Birth-day, and this Night I dedicate to Joys, which ever languish, If you refuse to crown them with your Presence. Myr. Nicanor, I was warm on other Thoughts.— Nic. I am still near you in the Day of Danger, In toilsome Marches, and the bloody Field, When Nations against Nations clash in Arms, And half a People in one Groan expire; Why am I, with your Helmet, thrown aside, Cast off, and useless in the hour of Peace? Myr. Since then you press it, I must be your Guest.— Methinks I labour as I onward move, As under Cheque of some controuling Power. [Aside. What can this mean? Wine may relieve my Thoughts, And Mirth and Converse lift my Soul again. [Exeunt. The back Scene draws and shows a Banquet. Enter Mandane richly dress'd. Mand. It was this Day that gave me Life, this Day Shou'd give much more, shou'd give me Memnon too; But I am Rival'd by his Chains, they clasp The Heroe round, (a cold, unkind Embrace!) And but an Earnest of far worse to come. While he, my Soul, in Dungeon Darkness clos'd, Breaths damp unwholsome Steams, and lives on Poison; I am compell'd to suffer Ornaments, To wear the Rainbow, and to blaze in Gems. To put on all the shining Guilt of Dress, When 'tis almost a Crime that I still live: These Eyes, which can't dissemble, pouring forth The dreadful Truth, are honest to my Heart. These Robes, O Memnon! are Mandane's Chains, And load, and gall, and wring her bleeding Heart. [Exit Mandane. Enter Myron, Nicanor, Auletes, &amp;c. They take their Places. Nic. Sound louder, sound, and waft my Wish to Heav'n. Hear me, ye righteous Gods, and grant my Prayer, For ever shine propitious on my Daughter, Protect her, prosper her, and when I'm Dead, Still bless me in Mandane's Happiness— [The Bowl goes round. Musick. Haste, call my Daughter; none can taste of Joy Till she, the Mistress of the Feast, is with us. A Servant brings Nicanor a Letter, he reads it. The King's Commands at any Hour are welcome. Myr. Not leave us, General? Nic. Ha! The King here writes me, The discontented Populace that held O'er Midnight Bowls their desperate Cabals, Are now in bold Defiance to his Power. Amid the Terrors of this Stormy Night, Even now they Deluge all yon Western Vale, And form a War, impatient for the Day. The spreading Poyson too has caught his Troops, And the Revolting Soldiers stand in Arms Mix'd with Seditious Citizens. Myr. Your Call is great. Enter Mandane. Myron starts from his Seat in Disorder Mand. Oh Memnon! How shall I become a Banquet Suppress my Sorrow, and comply with Joy? Severest Fate! Am I denied to grieve? [Aside Nic. Be comforted, my Child, I'll soon return. Why dost thou make me blush? I feel my Tears Run trickling down my Cheek. Myr. I must away: Her Smiles were dreadful, but her Tears are Death. I can no more: I sink beneath her Charms, And feel a deadly Sickness at my Heart. [Aside to Auletes. Nic. Your Cheek is pale, I dare not let you part, You are not well.— Myr. A small Indisposition, I soon shall throw it from me: Farewell, General; Conquest attend your Arms. Nic. You shall not leave Your Servant's Roof, 'tis an unwholesome Air, And my Apartment wants a Guest. Myr. Nicanor, If Health returns, I shall not press my Couch, And hear of distant Conquests; but o'ertake thee; And add new Terrors to the Front of War. Nic. Mean time, You are a Guardian to my Child, Let her not miss a Father in my Absence, She's all my Soul holds dear. Both. Farewell. Farewell. [Embrace. [Nicanor waits on Myron off the Stage, and returns. Nic. My Child, I feel a Tenderness at Heart I never felt before; come near, Mandane, Let me gaze on thee, and indulge the Father.— Thy dying Mother with her Clay-cold Hand Press'd mine, then turning on thee her faint Eye, Let fall a Tear of Fondness, and expir'd.— I cannot love thee well enough, her Grace Softens thy Cheek, and lives within thine Eye, Let me embrace you Both.—My Heart o'erflows.— If I should fall.—Thy Mother's Monument.— But I shall kill thy Tenderness.—No more, Nay, do not weep, I shall return again, And with my dearest Child sit down in Peace, And long enjoy her Goodness. Mand. If the Gods Regard your Daughter's fervent Vows, you will. Nic. Farewell my only Care, my Soul is with thee, Regard your self, and you remember me. [Exit. Enter Myron and Auletes. Myr. No Place can give me Ease, my restless Thought, Like working Billows in a troubled Sea, Tosses me to and fro, nor know I whither. What am I, who, or where? Ha! where indeed! But let me pause, and ask my self again If I am well awake.—Impetuous Bliss!— My Heart leaps up, my mounting Spirits blaze; My Soul is in a Tempest of Delight! Aul. My Lord, you tremble, and your Eyes betray Strange Tumults in your Breast. Myr. What Hour of Night? Aul. My Lord, the Night's far spent. Myr. The Gates are barr'd, And all the Houshold is compos'd to Rest? Aul. All: And the great Nicanor's own Apartment, Proud to receive a Royal Guest, expects you. Myr. Perdition on thy Soul for naming him. Nicanor! Oh I never shall sleep more! Defend me! Whether wander'd by bold Thoughts! Broke loose from Reason, how did they run mad! And now they are come home, all arm'd with Stings, And pierce my bleeding Heart.— I beg the Gods to disappoint my Crime, Yet almost wish them deaf to my Desire; I long, repent; repent, and long again, And every Moment differs from the last. I must no longer parley with Destruction. Auletes, seize me, force me to my Chamber, There chain me down, and guard me from my self, Hell rises in each Thought, 'tis time to fly. [Exeunt. Enter Mandane and Rameses. Ram. I hope your Fears have given a false Alarm. Mand. You've heard my frequent Visions of the Night, You know my Father's Absence, Myron's Passion; Just now I met him, at my Sight he started, Then with such ardent Eyes he wander'd o'er me, And gaz'd with such Malignity of Love, Sending his Soul out to me in a Look So fiercely kind, I trembled, and retired. Ram. No more; my Friends (which as I have inform'd you, The Queen to gall the Tyrant has set free) Are lodg'd within your Call, the appointed Signal, If Danger threatens, brings them to your Rescue. Mand. Where are they? Ram. In the Hall beneath your Chamber. Memnon alone is wanting; He's providing For your Escape before the Morning Dawn: The rest in Vizors, fearing to be known, Have ventur'd thro' the Streets for your Protection. Mand. Auspicious Turn! then I again am happy. Ram. Auspicious Turn indeed! and what compleats The Happiness, the base Man that betray'd us, This Arm laid low: I watch'd him from the King, I took him warm, while he with lifted Brow Confess'd high Thought, and triumph'd in his Mein, I thank'd him with my Dagger in his Heart. 'Tis late, refresh your self with Sleep, Mandane. [Exit Mandane. So, 'tis resolv'd, if Myron dares attempt So black a Crime, it justifies the Blow; He dyes, and my poor Brother's Ghost shall smile. This Way he bends his Steps, I hate his Sight, And shall, till Death has made it lovely to me. [Exit. Enter Myron and Auletes. Myr. Oh how this Passion like a Whirlpool drives me, With giddy, rapid Motion round and round, I know not where, and draws in all my Soul! I reason much; but Reason about her, And where she is, all Reason dyes before her; And Arguments but tell me I am conquer'd.— So black the Night, as if no Star e'er shone In all the wide Expanse, the Light'ning's Flash But shews the Darkness, and the bursting Clouds With Peals of Thunder seem to rock the Land: Not Beasts of Prey dare now from Shelter roam, But howl in Dens, and make the Forrest groan, What then am I? a Monster yet more fell, Than haunts the Wilds?—I am, and threaten more: My Breast is darker than this dreadful Night, And feels a fiercer Tempest rage within.— I must—I will—this leads me to her Chamber— Did not the Raven croak? [Starting. Aul. I hear her not. Myr. By Heav'n, methinks Earth trembles under me.— Awake, ye Furies, you are wanting to me, O finish me in Ill, O take me whole; Or Gods confirm me good, without Allay, Nor leave me thus at Variance with my self; Let me not thus be dash'd from side to side.— The old Man wept at parting, kneel'd before me, Confided in me, gave her to my Care, Nor long since sav'd my Life—and doubt I still? I'm guilty of the Fact, here let me lye, And rather groan for ever in the Dust And float the Marble Pavement with my Tears, Than rise into a Monster. [Flings himself down. Mandane passing at a Distance, speaks to a Servant. Mand. Well observe me. Before the rising Sun my Lord arrives, To seal our Vows the Holy Priest is with him; Watch to receive them at the Western Gate, And privately conduct them to my Chamber. [Exit. Myr. starting up.] Oh Torment! Racks! and Flames! then she expects him! With open Arms! Am I cast out for ever, For ever must despair, unless I snatch The present Moment? She is all prepar'd, Her Wishes waking, and her Heart on Fire! That pow'rful Thought sweeps Heav'n and Hell before it, And lays all open to the Prince of Egypt; Born to enjoy whatever he desires, And fling Fear, Anguish, and Remorse behind him. I see her midnight Dress, her flowing Hair, Her slacken'd Bosom, her relenting Mien; All the forbidding Forms of Day flung off For yielding Softness—Oh I'm all Confusion! I shiver in each Joint!—Ah! she was made To justifie the blackest Crimes, and gild Ruin and Death with her destructive Charms. Aul. You'll force her then. Myr. Thou Villain but to think it. No, I'll sollicit her with all my Pow'r, Conquest and Crowns shall sparkle in her Sight. If she consent, thy Prince is bless'd indeed, Takes Wing, and Tow'rs above Mortality: If she resist, I put an End to Pain, And lay my breathless Body at her Feet. Mandane passing at a distance to her Chamber, Myron meets her. Mand. Is this well done, my Lord? Myr. Condemn me not Before you hear me; let this Posture tell you, I'm not so Guilty as perhaps your Fears, Your commendable, modest Fears suspect: Nay, do not go, you know not what you do; I wou'd receive a Favour, not constrain it; Return, or good Nicanor, best of Fathers, Shall charge you with the Murder of his Friend. Mand. And dare you then pronounce that sacred Name, And yet persist! Were you his mortal Foe What cou'd your Malice more? Myr. Oh Fair Mandane? I know my Fault, I know your Virtue too, But such the Violence of my Disorder, That I dare tempt even you: Methinks that Guilt Has something lovely which proclaims your Power— But touch me with your Hand, I dye with Bliss. Why swells your Eye? By Heav'n I'd rather see All Nature mourn, than you let fall a Tear. I own I'm mad, but I am mad of Love: You can't condemn me more, than I my self, In that we are agreed, agree in all. Condemn, but pity me; resent, but yield; For oh, I burn, I rave, I dye with Love! Mand. Oh Sir!— Myr. Nay, do not weep so, it will kill me; This Moment, while I speak, my Eyes are darken'd, I cannot see thee, and my trembling Limbs Refuse to bear their Weight; all left of Life Is that I Love, if Love was in our Power The fault were mine, since not, you must comply. How God-like to bestow more heav'nly Joys Than you can think, and I support, and live? Mand. Oh, how can you abuse your sacred Reason, That Particle of Heav'n, that Soul of Jove, To varnish o'er and paint so black a Crime!— Oh Prince!— Myr. What says Mandane? Mand. Sir, observe me, My bursting Sighs, and ever streaming Tears; Your noble Nature has with Pity seen; But wou'd they not work deeper in your Soul, Were you convinc'd my Sorrows flow for you; For you, my Lord, they flow, for I am safe, (I know you are surpriz'd) they flow for you. Myron, my Father's Friend, my Prince, my Guest— Myron, my Guardian God, attempts my Peace, And need I further Reason for these Tears? Nature affords no Object of Concern So great, as to behold a generous Mind, Driven by a sudden Gust, and dash'd on Guilt— 'Tis base, you ought not; 'tis impracticable; You cannot—Make Necessity your Choice; Nor let one Moment of defeated Guilt, Of fruitless Baseness, overthrow the Glory Your whole Illustrious Life has dearly bought In toilsome Marches, and in Fields of Blood. Enter Auletes and Servants. Aul. My Lord, your Life's beset; the Room beneath Is throng'd with Ruffians, which but wait the Signal To rush, and sheath their Daggers in your Heart. Myr. Betray'd, curst Sorceress, it was a Plot Concerted by them all to take my Life, And this the Bait to tempt me to the Foil. She dies— Aul. No, first Enjoy, then Murther her— Trust to my Conduct, and you still are safe. They all are Mask'd, I have my Vizor too, But Time is short; for once confide in me. You, Sir, for Safety, fly to your Apartment; [To the Prince. You bear Mandane to her Closet—You [To Servants. Speed to the Southern Gate, and burst it open. [As the Servants seize Mandane, she gives the Signal. She is born off. Enter Ramases and Conspirators Mask'd. Ram. The Villain fled? Perdition intercept him! Disperse, fly several ways, let each Man bear A steady Point well levell'd at his Heart; If he escapes us now, Success attend him, May he for ever Triumph! As they pass the Stage in Confusion, Auletes enters Mask'd among them. Aul. Ha! Why halt you! Pursue, pursue, e'en now I saw the Monster, The Villain Myron, with these Eyes I saw him Bearing his Prize swift to the Western Gate: There, there it burst. A Noise without. All. Away, pursue. Aul. 'Tis done [Without. Advance the Massey Bar, and all is safe; Stand here, and with your Lives defend the Pass. Enter Myron. Myr. I shall at least have time for Vengeance on her, And then I care not if I die. Barbarians! Their Swords are pointed at my Life! 'Tis well But I will give them an Excuse for Murder, Such, such a Cause—Off Love, and soft Compassion; Harden each Sinew of my Heart to Steel. I'll do, what done will shock my self, and those, Whom Time sets farthest from their dreadful Hour. Enter Mandane forc'd in by Auletes. Mand. By all the Pow'rs that can revenge a Falshoood, I'm innocent from any Thoughts of Blood. Myr. Why then your Champions here in Arms? 'Tis false. Mand. Ah let my Life suffice you for the Wrong You Charge upon me! Oh my Royal Master! My Safety from all Ill! My great Defender! Or did my Father but insult my Tears, And give me to your Care to suffer Wrong; Kill me, but not your Friend, but not my Father; He loves us both, and my severe Distress Will scarce more deeply Wound him than your Guilt. [Myron walks passionately at a distance. Myr. Slaves, are you sworn against me? Stop her Voice, And bear her to my Chamber. Mand. Oh Sir! Oh Myron! Behold my Tears—here I will fix for ever— I'll clasp your Feet—and grow into the Earth Oh cut me, hue me,—give to every Limb A separate Death—but spare my spotless Virtue,— But spare my Fame—You wound to distant Ages— And thro' all Time my Memory will bleed. Myr. Distraction! all the Pains of Hell are on me! [As Servants force in Mandane, Mand. Oh Memnon!—Oh my Lord!—my Life!—where art Thou? [She is born off. [Myron expresses sudden Passion and Surprize, stands awhile fixed in Astonishment, then speaks. Myr. As many Accidents concur to work My Passions up to this unheard-of Crime, As if the Gods design'd it—be it then Their Fault, not Mine—Memnon! said she not Memnon? My Heart began to stagger, but 'tis over— Heav'n blast me if thought it possible I could be still more curst—That hated Dog Her Lord, her Life!—I thank her for my Cure Of all Remorse, and Pity; This has left me Without a Check, and thrown the loosen'd Reins On my wild Passion to rush headlong on; And in her Ruin quench a double Fire, The blended Rage of Vengeance and of Love. Destruction full of Transport! lo I come Swift on the Wing, to meet my certain Doom: I know the Danger, and I know the Shame; But like our Phœnix, in so rich a Flame I plunge Triumphant my devoted Head, And doat on Death in that Luxurious Bed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter Myron in the utmost Disorder, bare-headed, without Light, &amp;c. Walks disturbedly before he speaks. Myr. Henceforth let no Man trust the first false Step Of Guilt, it hangs upon a Precipice, Whose steep Descent in last Perdition ends! How far am I plung'd down beyond all Thought Which I this Evening fram'd!—But be it so, Consummate Horror! Guilt beyond a Name! Dare not, my Soul, repent; in thee Repentance Were second Guilt, and thou blasphem'st just Heav'n, By hoping Mercy. Ah! my Pain will cease When Gods want Pow'r to punish.—Ha! the Dawn— Rise never more, O Sun! let Night prevail, Eternal Darkness close the World's wide Scene, And hide me from Nicanor, and my self. Enter Auletes. Who's there? Aul. My Lord? Myr. Auletes? Aul. Guard your Life; The House is rouz'd, the Servants all alarm'd, The gliding Tapers dart from Room to Room; Solemn Confusion, and a trembling Haste Mixt with pare Horror, glares on ev'ry Face: The stregthned Foe has rush'd upon your Guard, And cut their Passage thro' them to the Gate, Implacable Rameses leads them on, Breathing Revenge, and panting for your Blood. Myr. Why, let them come, let in the raging Torrent, I wish the World wou'd rise in Arms against me, For I must dye, and I would dye in State. The Doors are burst open, Servants pass the Stage in Tumult. Rameses, &amp;c. pursues Myron's Guards over the Stage, then Rameses and Syphoces enter meeting. Ram. Where's the Prince? Syph. The Monster stands at Bay, We can no more than shut him from Escape Till further Force arrive. Ram. Oh my Syphoces! Syph. This is a Grief, but not for Words. Does she still live? Ram. She lives—but oh how blest Are they which are no more! by Stealth I saw her, Cast on the Ground in Mourning Weeds she lies, Her torn and loosen'd Tresses shade her round, Thro' which her Face, all pale as she were dead, Gleams like a sickly Moon; too great her Grief For Words or Tears! but ever and anon After a dreadful, still, insidious Calm, Collecting all her Breath, long, long suppress'd, She Sobs her Soul out in a lengthned Groan, So sad, it breaks the Heart of all that hear, And sends her Maids in Agonies away. Syph. Oh Tale, too mournful to be thought on! Ram. Hold— No, let her Virgins weep, forbear Syphoces, Tear out an Eye, but damp not our Revenge, Dispatch your Letters; I'll go comfort her. [A Servant speaks aside to Rameses. Exit Syphoces. And has she then commanded none approach her? I'm sorry for it, but I cannot blame her, Such is the dreadful Ill, that it converts All offer'd Cure into a new Disease, It shuns our Love, and Comfort gives her Pain. Re-enter Syphoces. Syph. Your Father is return'd; redundant Nile, Broke from its Channel, overswells the Pass, And sends him back to wait the Water's Fall. Ram. And is he then return'd?—I tremble for him.— I see his white Head rolling in the Dust: But haste, it is our Duty to receive him. [Exit. Enter Myron. Myr. I feel a Pain of which I am not worthy, A Pain, an Anguish, which the honest Man Alone deserves.—Is it not wond'rous strange, That I who stabb'd the very Heart of Nature, Should have surviving ought of Man about me? And yet, I know not how, of Gratitude And Friendship still the stubborn Sparks survive, And poor Nicanor's Torments pierce my Soul. Confusion! he's return'd. [Starting. Enter Nicanor. Nic. My Prince— [Advancing to embrace. Myr. My Friend— [Turning aside, and hiding his Face. Nic. I interrupt you. Myr. I had thee there. [Smiting his Breast. Before thou cam'st, my Thoughts were bent upon thee. Nic. Oh Sir, you are too kind! Myr. Death! Tortures! Hell! [Aside. Nic. What says my Prince? Myr. A sudden Pain, To which I'm subject, struck a-cross my Heart: 'Tis past, I'm well again. Nic. Heav'n guard your Health. Myr. Do'st Thou then wish it? Nic. Am I then distrusted? Then when I sav'd your Life, I did the least I e'er wou'd do to serve you. Myr. Barbarous Man!— Nic. What have I done, my Prince, which way offended? Has not my Life, my Soul, been yours? Myr. Oh!—Oh!— Nic. By Heav'n I'm wrong'd, speak, and I'll clear my self. [Takes him by the Hand. Myr. I'm Poyson and Destruction, curse thy Gods, I'll kill thee in Compassion.—Oh my Brain! Away, away, away. [Shoves him from him, going. Nic. Do, kill me, Prince,— You shall not go, I do demand the Cause, Which has put forth thy Hand against thy Father! For thus provok'd, I'll do my self the Justice, To tell thee, Youth, that I deserve that Name, Nor have thy Parents lov'd thee more than I. Myr. I hear them, they are on me.—Loose thy Hold, Or I will plant my Dagger in thy Breast. Nic. Your Dagger's needless!—Oh ungrateful Boy! Myr. Forgive me, Father, Oh my Soul bleeds for thee. [Embrace. As he is going out, Auletes meets him, and speaks to him aside. What, no Escape? on every Side inclos'd! Then I resolve to perish by his Hand, 'Tis just I should, and meaner Death I scorn. But how to work him to my Fate, to sting His Passion up so high, will be a Task, To me severe, as difficult and strange. Support me, cruel Heart, it must be done. [Aside. Nic. Now from my very Soul, I cannot tell But 'tis Enchantment all, for Things so strange Have happen'd, I might well distrust my Sense; But if mine Eyes are true, I plainly read A Heart in Anguish, and I must confess Your Grief is just.—It was inhumane in you,— But tell the Cause, unravel from the Bottom The Mystery that has embroyl'd our Loves, (For still, my Prince, I love, since you repent.) What Accident depriv'd me of my Friend, And lost you to your self? Myr. A Traytor's Sight. Nic. Beneath my Roof? Myr. Beneath thy very Helmet, Thou art a Traytor. Guard thy self. [Draws. Nic. Distraction! Traytor!—For standing by your Father's Throne; And stemming the wild Stream that roars against it Of Rebel Subjects, and of Foreign Foes? For training thee to Glory and to War? For taking thee from out thy Mother's Arms A mortal Child, and kindling in thy Soul The noble Ardors of a future God? Farewell, I dare not trust my Temper more. Myr. Grey-headed, venerable Traytor! Enter Rameses. Ram. Ha! Turn, turn, Blasphemer, and repress thy Taunts; All Provocation's needless, but thy Sight. [He assaults the Prince, Nicanor hinders him. Nic. Forbear, my Son. Ram. Forbear? Nic. If I am calm Your Rage should cease. Ram. No, 'tis my own Revenge, Unless, Sir, you disown me for your Son. Nic. Thy Sword against thy Prince? Ram. A Villain. Nic. Hold. Ram. The worst of Villains. Nic. 'Tis too much. Ram. Oh Father!— Nic. What woud'st thou? Ram. Sir, your Daughter— Nic. Rightly thought; She best can comfort me in all my Sorrows: Call, call Mandane; to behold my Child Wou'd chear me in the Agonies of Death; Call her, Rameses.—Am I disobey'd? Ram. Oh, Sir!— Nic. What mean those Transports of Concern? Ram. Though I'm an Outcast from your Love, I weep, To open your black Scene of Misery. Nic. Where will this end?—Oh my foreboding Heart! Ram. Should he, to whom, as to a God, at parting, You gave, with streaming Eyes, your Soul's Delight, While yet your last Embrace was warm about him, Gloomy and dreadful as this stormy Night, Rush on your Child, your Comfort, your Mandane, All sweet, and lovely as the blushing Morn, Seize her by Force, now trembling, breathless, pale, Prostrate in Anguish, tearing up the Earth, Imploring, shrieking to the Gods and you.— Oh hold my Brain!—Look there, and think the rest. The back Scene opens. A darken'd Chamber, a Bed, and the Curtains drawn. Women pass out, weeping, &amp;c. Nicanor falls back on Rameses. Nic. Is't possible!—My Child!—My only Daughter!— The Growth of my own Life! That sweeten'd Age And Pain!—Oh Nature bleeds within me! Mand. Weep not, my Virgins, cease your useless Tears, Kindness is thrown away upon Despair, And but provokes the Sorrow it wou'd ease. Nic. Assist me forwards. Mand. Most unwelcome News! Is he return'd? The Gods support my Father. I now begin to wish he lov'd me less. Nic. There, there she pierc'd the very tender'st Nerve: She pities me, dear Babe, she pities me: Through all the raging Tortures of her Soul She feels my Pain! But hold, my Heart, to thank her, Then burst at once, and let the Pangs of Death Put Myron from my Thought. [Goes to her. Mand. Severest Fate Has done its worst.—I've drawn my Father's Tears.— Nic. Forbear to call me by that tender Name; Since I can't help thee, I wou'd fain forget Thou art a Part of me—it only sharpens Those Pangs, which, if a Stranger, I should feel.— Oh spare me, my Mandane; to behold thee In such Excess of Sorrow, quite destroys me, And I shall dye, and leave thee Unreveng'd. Mand. Oh, Sir, There are Misfortunes most severe, Which yet can bear the Light, and well sustain'd Adorn the Sufferer.—But this Affliction Has made Despair a Virtue, and demands Utter Extinction, and eternal Night, As Height of Happiness. [Scene shuts on them. Enter Syphoces. Ram. Oh my Syphoces! Syph. And does this move you, does this melt you down And pour you out in Sorrow? then fly far, E'er Memnon comes; he comes with flushing Cheek, And beating Heart, to bear a Bride away, And bless his Fate; how dreadfully deceiv'd! Ram. The melancholy Scene at length begins. Enter Memnon. Mem. Oh, give me Leave, To yield to Nature, and indulge my Joy, My Friend! My Brother! Oh the Extasie That fires my Veins, and dances at my Heart! You love me not, if you refuse to join In all the just Extravagance, and Flight Of boundless Transport on this happy Hour. Where is my Soul, my Bliss, my lovely Bride! Call, call her forth; Oh haste, the Priest expects us And every Moment is a Crime to Love. Ram. Speak to him.—Prithee speak. [To Syph. Syph. By Heav'n I cannot. Mem. What can this mean? Ram. Syphoces. Syph. Nay, Rameses. Mem. By all the Gods, they struggle with their Sorrows, And swallow down their Tears to hide them from me. By Friendship's sacred Name, I charge you, speak. [They look on him with the utmost Concern, and go out on different Sides of the Stage Was ever Man thus left to dreadful Thought, And all the Horrors of a black Surmise! What Woe is this too big to be express'd? Oh my sad Heart! Why bod'st thou so severely? Mandane's Life's in Danger! There indeed; Fortune, I fear thee still; her Beauties arm thee, Her Virtues make thee dreadful to my Thought: But for my Love how I cou'd laugh at Fate? Enter a Servant, and gives him a Paper. He reads. Enter Rameses, Memnon swoons and falls on Ram. Ram. 'Twere happy if his Soul wou'd ne'er return; The Gods may still be merciful in this.— His Lids begin to rise.—How fares my Friend? Mem. Did Myron feel my Pangs, you'd pity him. Enter Sophoces. Syph. Fainting beneath th'Oppression of her Grief, This Way Mandane seeks the fresher Air: Let us withdraw; 'twill pain her to be seen, And most of all by you. Mem. By my own Heart, I judge, and am convinc'd.—I dare not see her, The Sight wou'd strike me dead. [As Memnon is going, Mandane meets him; both start back, she shrieks. Memnon recovers himself and falls at her Knees, embracing them; she tries to disengage, he not permitting, she raises him, he takes her passionately in his Arms. They continue speechless and motionless some Time. Ram. Was ever mournful Interview like This? See how they writhe with Anguish! hear them groan! See the large silent Dew run trickling down, As from the weeping Marble; Passion choaks Their Words, and they're the Statues of Despair! Mem. Oh my Mandane! [At this she violently breaks from him, and Exit. But one Moment more. [As Memnon is following, Rameses holds him. Ram. Brother— Mem. Forgive me.— Ram. You're to blame.— Mem. Look there. [Pointing after her. My Heart is bursting. Ram. With Revenge. Mem. And Love. Ram. Revenge. Mem. One dear Embrace, 'twill edge my Sword. Syph. No, Memnon, if our Swords now want an Edge, They'll want for ever; to this Spot I charm thee; By the Dread Words, Revenge and Liberty! This is the Crisis of our Fates, this Moment The Guardian Gods of Egypt hover o'er us, They watch to see us act like prudent Men, And out of Ills extract our Happiness. My Friends, these dire Calamities, like Poyson, May have their wholesome Use! this sad Occasion, If manag'd artfully, revives our Hopes; It gives Nicanor to our sinking Faction, And still the Tyrant shakes. Ram. My Father comes; Or snatch this Moment, or despair for ever. While Passions glow, the Heart, like heated Steel, Takes each Impression, and is work'd at Pleasure. Enter Nicanor. Nic. Why have the Gods chose out my weakest Hours, To set their Terrors in array against me? This wou'd beat down the Vigour of my Youth, Much more grey Hairs, and Life worn down so low. Vain Man! to be so fond of breathing long, And spinning out a Thread of Misery. The longer Life the greater Choice of Evil; The happiest Man is but a wretched Thing, That steals poor Comfort from Comparison; What then am I? here will I sit me down, Brood o'er my Cares, and think my self to Death. Draw near, Rameses; I was rash e'er while, And chid thee without Cause.—How many Years Have I been cas'd in Steel? Ram. Full Threescore Years Have changed the Seasons o'er your crested Brow, And seen your Fauchion dy'd in Hostile Blood. Nic. How many Triumphs since this King has reign'd! Ram. They number just your Battels, one for one. Nic. True, I have follow'd the rough Trade of War With some Success, and can without a Blush Review the shaken Fort, and sanguine Plain. I have thought Pain a Pleasure, Thirst and Toil Blest Objects of Ambition; I remember, (Nor do my Foes forget that bloody Day:) When the barb'd Arrow from my gaping Thigh Was wrench'd with Labour, I disdain'd to groan, Because I suffer'd for Busiris' Sake. Ram. The King is not to blame. Nic. Is not the Prince his Son? Ram. But in himself— Nic. And has he lost his Guilt, [Rising in Passion. 'Cause he has injur'd me? Erewhile thy Blood Was kindled at his Name.—Did'st Thou not tell me A shameful black Design on poor Amelia? Oh Memnon! what a glorious Race is this, To make the Gods a Party in our Cause, And draw down Blessings on us! Mem. He that supports them In such black Crimes, is Sharer of their Guilt. Nic. Point out the Man, and with these wither'd Hands I'd fly upon his Throat, tho' he were lodg'd Within the Circle of Busiris' Arms. Ram. He that prevents it not when in his Power, Supports them in their Course of flaming Guilt, And You are He. Nic. Thou rav'st. Syph. The Army's yours. I've sounded every Chief; but wave your Finger, Thousands fall off the Tyrant's Side, and leave him Naked of Help, and open to Destruction. But sweep his Minions, cut a Pander's Throat, Or lop a Sycophant, the Work is done. Nic. What wou'd you have me do? [Starting. Mem. Let not your Heart Fly off from your own Thought, be truly Great, Resent your Country's Suff'rings as your own. A generous Soul is not confin'd at home, But spreads its self abroad o'er all the Publick, And feels for every Member of the Land. What have we seen for Twenty rolling Years, But one long Tract of Blood! or, what is worse, Throng'd Dungeons pouring forth perpetual Groans, And free-born Men oppress'd! Shall half Mankind Be doom'd to curse the Moment of their Birth? Shall all the Mother's Fondness be employ'd To rear them up to Bondage, give them Strength To bear Afflictions, and support their Chains? Syph. To you the valiant Youth most humbly bend, [Kneeling. And beg that Nature's Gifts, the vigorous Nerve, And graceful Port design'd to bless the World, And take your great Example in the Field, May not be forc'd by Lewdness in high Place, To other Toils, to labour for Disease, To wither in a loath'd Embrace, and dye At an inglorious Distance from the Foe. Ram. To you Amelia lifts her Hands for Safety. [Kneeling. Mem. To you—To you— [Bursting into Tears. Nic. By Heav'n he cannot speak.—I understand thee. Rise.—Rise, my Son.—Rise all; your Work is done; They perish all, these Creatures of my Sword. Have I not seen whole Armies vaulted o'er With flying Javelins, which shut out the Day, And fell in rattling Storms at my Command, To slay, and bury proud Busiris' Foe? He lives and reigns, for I have been his Friend; But I'll Unmake him, and plough up the Ground, Where his proud Palace stands. [Exit. Mem. Oh, my Mandane! The Gods by dreadful Means bestow Success, And in their Vengeance most severely bless: From thy bright streaming Eyes our Triumphs flow, The Tyrant falls, Mandane strikes the Blow. So the fair Moon, when Seas swell high, and pour A wasteful Deluge on the trembling Shore, Inspires the Tumult from her clouded Throne, Where silent, pensive, pale, she sits alone, And all the distant Ruin is her own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. SCENE The Field. Enter Busiris and Auletes. An Alarm at Distance. Bus. Welcome the Voice of War! tho' loud the Sound, It faintly speaks the Language of my Heart. It Whispers what I mean. But say, Auletes, What urge these forlorn Rebels in Excuse For chusing Ruin? Aul. Various their Complaints. But some are loud, that while your heavy Hand Presses whole Millions with incessant Toil, (Toils fitter far for Beasts than human Creatures) In building Wonders for the World to gaze at, Weeds are their Food, their Cup the muddy Nile. Bus. Do they not build for Me? Let that reward them. Yes, I will build more Wonders to be gaz'd at, And temper all my Cement with their Blood. Whose Pains and Art reform'd the puzzled Year, Thus drawing down the Sun to human Use, And making Him their Servant? Who push'd off With Mountain Dams the broad redundant Nile Descended from the Moon, and bid it wander A Stranger Stream in unaccustom'd Shores! Who from the Ganges to the Danube reigns? But Virtues are forgot!—Away—to Arms! I'll call to Mind my glorious Ancestry, Which for ten thousand rolling Years renown'd Shines up into Eternity its self, And ends among the Gods. [An Alarm. Enter Memnon. Aul. The Rebel braves us. Bus. Hold, let our Weapons thirst one Moment longer; And Death stand still, till he receives my Nod.— Whom meet I in the midst of my own Realm, With bold Defiance on his Brow? Mem. The Slave, Whom Dread Busiris lately laid in Chains, An Emblem of his Country. Bus. Is it thus You thank my Royal Bounty? Mem. Thus you thank'd The good Artaxes, thus you thank'd my Father. Bus. What I have done, conclude most right and just, For I have done it, and the Gods alone Shall ask me Why; Thou liv'st, altho' they fell; And if they fell unjustly, greater Thanks Are due from Thee, whom even Injustice spar'd. Mem. Thy Kindnesses are Wrongs, they mean to sooth My Injur'd Soul, and steal it from Revenge. Bus. Turn back thine Eye, behold thy Troops are thin, Thy Men are rarely sprinkled o'er the Field, And yet thou carry'st Millions on thy Tongue. Mem. All, thy Blood-thirsty Sword has laid in Dust Are on my side, they come in bloody Swarms, And throng my Banners; thy unequal'd Crimes Have made Thee Weak, and rob my Victory.— Bus. Ha! Mem. Nay, stamp not, Tyrant; I can stamp as loud, And raise as many Dæmons at the Sound. Bus. I wear a Diadem. Mem. And I a Sword. Bus. Yet, yet submit, I give thee Life. Mem. Secure your own: No more, Busiris, bid the Sun farewel. Bus. Busiris and the Sun shou'd Set together, If this Day's angry Gods ordain my Fate Know thou, I fall like some vast Pyramid, I bury Thousands in my great Destruction, And Thou the first.—Slave! in the Front of Battel, There Thou shalt find me. Mem. Thou shalt find me there, And have well paid that Gratitude I owe. [Exeunt. A continued Alarm. Enter Myron and Nicanor meeting. Nic. Does not mine Eye strike Horror through thy Soul, And shake the Weapon from thy trembling Arm? Base Boy! The Foulness of thy Guilt secures Thee From my Reproach, I dare not name thy Crime. Myr. Old Man, didst thou stand up in thy own Cause, I then shou'd be afraid of Fourscore Years, And tremble at Grey Hairs; but since thy Frenzy Has lent those venerable Locks to cast A Gloss of Virtue on the blackest Crime, Accurst Rebellion! This gives back my Heart, With all its Rage, and I'm a Man again. Nic. Come on, and use that Force in Arms, I taught thee; I'll now resume the Life I gave so late. Myr. I grieve thou hast but half a Life to lose, And dost defraud my Vengeance—At my Touch Thou moulder'st into Dust, and art Forgotten. [Preparing to fight, Myr. stops short. Ah no! I cannot fight with Thee, begone And shake elsewhere; Thou canst not want a Death In such a Field, though I refuse it to thee. Rameses, Memnon, give them to my Sword, Sustain'd by Thousands; but to fly from Thee, From Thee, most injur'd Man, shall be my Praise, And rise above the Conquest of my Foes. Nic. 'Tis not old Age, th'avenging Gods pursue thee! [He retires before Nicanor off the Stage. A loud Alarm. Enter Busiris and Auletes in Pursuit. Bus. 'Tis well, I like this Madness of the Field: Let heighten'd Horrors, and a Waste of Death Inform the World Busiris is in Arms. But then I grudge the Glory of my Sword To Slaves, and Rebels, while they die by me, They cheat my Vengeance, and survive in Fame. Aul. I panted after in the Paths of Death, And cou'd not but from far behold your Plume O'er-shadow slaughter'd Heaps, while your bright Helm Struck a distinguish'd Terror through the Field, The distant Legions trembling as it blaz'd. Bus. Think not a Crown alone Lights up my Name, My Hand is deep in Fight. Forbid it Isis! That whilst Busiris treads the sanguine Field, The foremost Spirit of his Host shou'd Conquer But by Example, and beneath the Shade Of this high-brandish'd Arm. Did'st thou e'er fear? Sure 'tis an Art, I know not how to fear. 'Tis one of the few things beyond my Power; And if Death must be fear'd before 'tis felt, Thy Master is Immortal. O Auletes— But while I speak, they live! Where fall the sounding Cataracts of Nile, The Mountains tremble, and the Waters boil; Like them I'll rush, like them my Fury pour, And give the future World one Wonder more. [Exeunt. Enter Myron engaged with a Party; his Plume is smitten off. He drives the Foe, and returns. Myr. When Death's so near, but dares not venture on us, 'Tis Heav'n's Regard, a kind of Salutation, Which to our selves our own Importance shows.— Faint as I am, and almost sick of Blood, There is one Cordial wou'd revive me still; The sight of Memnon, place that Fiend before me.— [Ex. Enter Memnon. Mem. Where, where's the Prince? O give him to my Sword! His tall white Plume, which like a high-wrought Foam Floated on the tempestuous Stream of Fight, Shew'd where he swept the Field; I follow'd swift, But my Approach has turn'd him into Air;— Enter Myron. The Fight but now begins! Myr. Why who art Thou? Mem. Prince, I am— Myr. Memnon. [Disdainfully. Mem. No,—I'm Mandane. Myr. Ha! Mem. She's here, she's here, she's all: Her Wrongs and Virtues! [Striking his Head and Breast. Virtues and Wrongs! Thou worse than Murderer! Myr. I charge Thee name her not, forbear to Croak With that Ill-omen'd Note. Mem. Mandane! Myr. Be it so. When I reflect on her mean Love for Thee, And Plot against my Life, my Pain is less. Mem. 'Tis false; she meant, she knew it not; Rameses, He, only he, was conscious of the Thought. Myr. Then I'm a Wretch indeed! Mem. As such I'll use Thee: I'll crush Thee like some Poyson on the Earth, Then haste and Cleanse me in the Blood of Men. Myr. I thank Thee for this Spirit which exalts Thee Into a Foe, I need not blush to meet. Now from my Soul, it Joys me thou art found, And found alive; by Heav'n, so much I hate Thee, I fear'd that Thou wast Dead, and had'st escap'd me: I'll drench my Sword in thy detested Blood, Or soon make thee Immortal by my own. Villain! Mem. Myron! Myr. Rebel! Mem. Myron! Myr. Hell! Mem. Mandane! [Myr. Falls. Myr. Just the Blow, and juster still, Because imbitter'd to me by that Hand I most detest; which gives my Soul an Earnest Of vast unfathomable Woes to come, That dreadful Dow'ry for my dreadful Love. I leave the World my Misery's Example, If us'd aright, no trivial Legacy. [Dies. Enter Syphoces. Syph. My Lord, I bring you most unwelcome News. As poor Mandane wander'd near the Field, In hope to see her Injuries Reveng'd; Thoughtless of any Suff'rings, but the past, A Party of the Foe, saw, seiz'd, and bore her off. Mem. Vengeance, and Conquest now are trivial Things; Love made their Prize! 'tis impious in my Soul To entertain a Thought but of her Rescue. Now, now, I plunge into the thickest War, As some bold Diver from a Precipice Into mid Ocean, to regain a Gem, Whose Loss impoverish'd Kings, to bring it back, Or see the Day no more. [Exeunt. Enter Mandane Prisoner. Mand. A generous Foe will hear his Captive speak; A Benefit thus kneeling I implore: Let one of all those Swords that glitter round me, Vouchsafe to hide its Point within my Breast. Enter Memnon. Mem. Ah Villains! Cursed Atheists! Can you bear That Posture from that Form? What, what are Numbers, When I behold those Eyes? not mine the Glory, That singly thus I quell a Host of Foes. Inhuman Robbers! Oh bring back my Soul. [They force her off, he rushes in upon them and is taken. Poor Comfort to Mankind that they can lose Their Lives but once—But oh! a thousand times Be torn from what they Love. Enter Rameses. Ram. Far have I waded in the bloody Field, Laborious through the stubborn Ranks of War, And trac'd thee in a Labyrinth of Death; But thus to find Thee!—Better find Thee Dead! These Slaves will use Thee ill. Mem. Of that no more; Myron is Dead, and by this Arm. Ram. I thank Thee. All my few Spirits left exult with Joy, I'll Chace, and Scourge him through the lower World. Mem. Alas thou bleed'st. Ram. Curse on the Tyrant's Sword, I bleed to Death. But cou'd not leave the World Without a last Embrace. Just now I met The poor Mandane. Mem. Quickly speak. What said she? Ram. Nothing of Comfort. Cease to ask me farther. If you meet more, your Meeting will be sad.— Your Arm, I faint—Ah what is Human Life? How like the Dyal's tardy moving Shade! Day after Day slides from us unperceiv'd! The cunning Fugitive is swift by Stealth, Too subtle is the Movement to be seen, Yet soon the Hour is up—and we are gone. Farewel, I pity Thee. [Dies. Mem. Farewel, brave Friend! Wou'd I cou'd bear Thee Company to Rest, But Life in all its Terrors stands before me, And shuts the Gate of Peace against my Wishes.— Do I not hear a Peal of distant Thunder? And see, a sudden Darkness shuts the Day, And quite blots out the Sun—but what to me The Colour of the Sky? A Death-cold Dew Hangs on my Brow, and all my slacken'd Joints Are shook without a Cause—A Groan? From whence? Again? And no one near me? Vain Delusion! Yet not I fear in vain! some Ill is towards me, More dreadful sure than all that's past. Mandane! I hop'd she was at Peace, and past the reach Of this ill News, but such my wayward Fate I cannot ask a Curse, but 'tis deny'd me: And cou'd I wish I ne'er should see her more? Enter Mandane guarded. Mand. This is my Brother; a short Privacy Is a small Favour you may grant a Foe. Guard. Let it be short, we may not wait your leisure. Mem. 'Tis wondrous strange, there's something holds me from her, And keeps this Foot fast rooted to the Ground. This is the last time I shall ever Pray. To me, ye Gods, confine your threatned Vengeance, And I will bless your Mercies while I suffer. [Memnon and Mandane advance slowly to the Front of the Stage. Mand. What didst thou pray for? Mem. For thy Peace. Mand. 'Twas kind: But oh! those Hands in Bonds deny the Blessing, For which they earnestly were rais'd to Heav'n. Mem. I fear so too; what we have yet to do Must be soon done; this Meeting is our last. How shall we use it? Mand. How? Consult thy Chains, And my Calamities. Mem. Sad Counsellors, And Cruel their Advice—Are there no other! Mand. I look around—and find no glimpse of Hope, A perfect Night of Horror, and Despair! Mem. Of Horror and Despair, indeed, Mandane! Canst thou believe me? Nay, can I believe My Self? The last Thing that I wish'd for was—'tis false. The Weight of my Misfortune hurt my Mind. Mand. Was what? Mem. I dare not think, to think is to look down A Precipice Ten Thousand Fathom deep, That turns my Brain—Oh! oh! Mand. Memnon, no more: That Silence, and those Tears need no Explaining; And it is kind, with such severe Reluctance To think upon my Death—though necessary. Mem. Ah hold! You plant a thousand Daggers here Talk not of Dying.—I disown the Thought; Right is not Right, and Reason is not Reason, All is Distraction when I look on Thee. Oh all ye pitying Gods! dash out from Nature Your Stars, your Sun, but let Mandane live. Mand. No: Death long since was my confirm'd Resolve. Mem. Myron is dead. Mand. What Joy a Heart like mine Can feel, it feels—had he been never born, I might have liv'd—'tis now—impossible. Mem. This even to my Miseries I owe, That it discovers greater Virtues still, In her my Soul adores.—Oh, my Mandane! Oh glorious Maid! then thou wilt be at Peace— [Memnon walks thoughtfully, then returns. Must I survive, and change thy Tenderness For a stern Master, and perpetual Chains? Long I may groan on Earth to sate their Malice, Then through slow Torments struggle into Death, No Steel to stab, no Wall to dash my Brain! Mand. Ha! Mem. Why thus fix'd in Thought? what mighty Birth Is labouring in your Soul? your Eyes speak Wonders.— Mand. Will not the Blood-Hounds be content with Life?— Mem. Alas, Mandane! No; they study Nature To find out all her secret Seats of Pain, And carry Killing to a dreadful Art: A simple Death in Egypt is for Friends. Mand. Oh then it must be so!—and yet it cannot.— Mem. What means this sudden Paleness? Mand. Heav'n assist me! [Feeling in her Bosom, she swoons. Mem. My Love! Mandane! hear me, my Espous'd! My dearest Heart! the Infant of my Bosom! Whom I would foster with my vital Blood. Mand. 'Tis well, and in Return I give thee—This. [Shews a Dagger. Mem. Millions of Thanks, thou Refuge in Despair. Mand. Terrible Kindness! Horrid Mercy! Oh! I cannot give it thee. Mem. Full well I know Thy tender Soul, and I must force it from thee. [As he is struggling with her for the Dagger, she speaks. Mand. My Lord! My Soul! My self! You tear my Heart. Art thou not dearer to my Eyes than Light? Do'st thou not circulate through all my Veins? Mingle with Life, and form my very Soul! Mem. Now, Monsters, I defy you: Fate forbids A long Farewell, my Guard may interpose, And make your Favour vain.—Thus, only thus. [Embrace. And now— Mand. Ah no! Since last I saw thee, thrice I rais'd [Holds his Arm. My trembling Arm, and thrice I let it fall.— If you refuse Compassion to my Sex, Memnon betrays me, and is Myron's Friend.— As I a Poynard, you supply an Arm, And I shall still be happy in your Love. [After a Pause of Astonishment he sinks gently on the Earth Mem. From dreadful, to more dreadful I am plung'd, And find in deepest Anguish deeper still. I can't complain in common with Mankind,— But am a wretched Species all alone. Must I not only lose thee, but be curst To sprinkle my own Hands with thy Life-Blood? Mand. It cannot be avoided. Mem. Nor perform'd. Lift up my Hand against thee as a Foe! I, who shou'd save thee from thy very Father, And teach thy dearest Friends to use thee well, Make Kindness kind, and soften all their Smiles? Oh my Mandane! Think how I have lov'd! Oh my Mandane! Think upon thy Pow'r! How often hast thou seen me pale with Joy, And trembling at a Smile? and shall I— Mand. Myron— [At that Memnon starts up suddenly. Mem. Ah hold! I charge thee hold! One Glance that Way Awakes my Hell, and blows up all its Flames.— The World turns round, my Heart is sick to Death! Oh my Distraction! perfect Loss of Thought! Mand. Why stand you like a Statue? are you dead? What do you fold so fast within your Arms? Why with fix'd Eye-balls do you pierce the Ground? Why shift your Place, as if you trod on Fire? Why gnaw your Lip, and groan so dreadfully? My Lord, if I have spent whole live-long Nights In Tears, and sigh'd away the Day in private, Only oppress'd with an Excess of Love, Oh turn, and speak to me! Mem. And these, no doubt, Are Arguments that I should draw thy Blood.— No Child was ever lull'd upon the Breast With half that Tenderness has melted from thee, And fell like Balm upon my wounded Soul. And shall I murder thee? Yes thus—thus—thus. [Embracing some Time. Mand. Alas! My Lord forgets we are to Dye. [Memnon gazes with Wonder on the Dagger. Mem. By Heav'n I had, my Soul had took her Flight In Bliss—why, is not this our Bridal-Day? Mand. That Way Distraction lies. Mem. Indeed it does. Both. Oh! Oh! Mand. Thy Sighs and Groans are sharper than thy Steel. The Guard is on us. Mem. Then it must be done. Sun hide thy Face, and put the World in Mourning, Though Blood start out for Tears 'tis done—but one, One last Embrace. [As he embraces her, she bursts into Tears. Let me not see a Tear.—I cou'd as soon Stab at the Face of Heaven, as kill thee weeping. Mand. 'Tis past, I am compos'd. Mem. And now, and now. Mand. Be not so fearful, 'tis the second Blow Will pain my Heart—indeed this will not hurt me. Mem. Oh thou hast stung my Soul quite through and through, With those kind Words; I had just steel'd my Breast, [Dashing down the Dagger. And thou undo'st it all—I cou'd not bear To raze thy Skin, to save the World from Ruin. Mand. If you're a Woman, I'll be something more.— [Stabs herself. I shall not taste of Heav'n till you arrive. [Dies. Mem. Struck home—and in her Heart.—She's dead already, And now with me all Nature is expir'd.— My lovely Bride; Now we again are happy, [Stabs himself. And better-Worlds prepare our Nuptial Bow'r.— Now every splendid Object of Ambition, Which lately with their various Glosses plaid Upon my Brain, and fool'd my idle Heart, Are taken from me by a little Mist, And all the World is vanish'd. [Dies A March sounded. Enter Nicanor and Syphoces Victorious. The Guard which were advancing to the Bodies fly. Nic. The Day's our own, the Persian's angry Pow'r Have well repaid this Morning's Insolence, And turn'd the desperate Fortune of the Field By sure, tho' late Relief. Syph. Nicanor, Friend, I from the City bring you welcome News: My guilty Letter from the amorous Queen I spread amongst the Multitude; while yet Their Blood was warm with reading the black Scroll, Myris to view the Fortune of the Fight, Leaving her Palace for the Western Tow'r, Was seiz'd, torn, scatter'd on the guilty Spot Where her great Brother fell. Nic. The Gods are just. Syph. See where Busiris comes, your Royal Captive, In his Misfortune great; an awful Ruin! And dreadful to the Conqueror! [Nicanor advancing sees the Bodies. Nic. Sad Sight!— A Sight, that teaches Triumph how to mourn, And more than justifies these streaming Tears, Even on the Moment that my Country's sav'd From sore Oppression, and inglorious Chains. [He falls on his Attendants. A great Shout. Enter Busiris Wounded. Bus. Conquer'd? 'Tis false; I am your Master still; Your Master, though in Bonds: You stand aghast At your good Fate, and trembling can't enjoy. Now from my Soul I hug these welcome Chains Which shew you all Busiris, and declare Crowns and Success superfluous to my Fame.— You think this streaming Blood will low'r my Thought; No, ye mistaken Men, I smile at Death; For living here, is living all alone, To me a real Solitude, amid A throng of little Beings, groveling round me; Which yet usurp one common Shape and Name. I thank these Wounds, these raging Pains, which promise An Interview with Equals soon elsewhere. [He sees Memnon. Ha! Dead? 'Tis well; he rose not to my Sword, I only wish'd his Fate, and there he lies. Some when they dye, dye all; their mould'ring Clay Is but an Emblem of their Memories: The Space quite closes up through which they pass'd. That I have liv'd I leave a Mark behind, Shall pluck the shining Age from vulgar Time, And give it whole to late Posterity. My Name is writ in mighty Characters, Triumphant Columns, and Eternal Domes, Whose Splendor heightens our Egyptian Day, Whose Strength shall laugh at Time, till their great Basis, Old Earth it self shall fail. In After-ages, Who War or Build, shall Build or War from me, Grow great in each, as my Example fires; 'Tis I of Art the future Wonders raise; I fight the future Battels of the World.— Great Jove, I come! Egypt, thou art forsaken: [Sinks Asia's Impoverish'd by my sinking Glories, And the World lessens, when Busiris falls. [Dies. Syph. Bear the Dead Monarch to his Pyramid; And for what Use soe'er it was design'd, By that high-minded, but mistaken Man, There let him lye Magnificent in Death; Great was his Life, great be his Monument: And on Busiris' Nephew, young Arsaces, Of gentler Spirit, let the Crown devolve. From this Day's Vengeance let the Nations know, Jove lays the Pride of haughtiest Monarchs low; And they who kindled with ambitious Fire, In Arts and Arms with most Success aspire, If void of Virtue, but provoke their Doom, Grasp at their Fate, and build themselves a Tomb.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, By a Friend. Spoken by Mrs. OLDFIELD. The Race of Criticks, dull judicious Rogues, To Mournful Plays deny Brisk Epilogues. Each gentle Swain and tender Nymph, say they, From a sad Tale should go in Tears away, From hence quite home should Streams of Sorrow shed, And drown'd in Grief steal supperless to Bed. This Doctrine is so grave, the Sparks won't bear it; They love to go in Humour to their Claret. The Citt, who owns a little Fun worth buying, Holds Half-a-Crown too much to pay for Crying. Besides, who knows without these healing Arts, But Love might turn your Heads, and break your Hearts; And the poor Author, by imagin'd Woes, Might people Bedlam with our Belles and Beaux? Hence I, who lately bid Adieu to Pleasure, Robb'd of my Spouse, and my dear Virgin Treasure; I, whom you saw despairing breathe my last, Am free and easy, as if nought had past; Again put on my Airs, and play my Fan, And fear no more that dreadful Creature, Man. —But whence does this malicious Mirth begin?— I know, ye Beasts, you reckon it no Sin. 'Tis strange that Crimes the same, in diff'rent Plays, Should move our Horror, and our Laughter raise. Love's Joy secure the Comick Actor tryes, But if he's wicked in Blank Verse, he Dyes. The Farce, where Wives prove frail, still takes the best, And the poor Cuckold is a standing Jest: But our grave Bard, a virtuous Son of Isis, Counts a bold Stroke in Love among the Vices, In Blood and Wounds a guilty Land he dips ye, And wastes an Empire for one ravish'd Gypsie. What musty Morals fill an Oxford Head, To Notions of pedantick Virtue bred! There each stiff Don at Gallantry exclaims, And calls fine Men and Ladies filthy Names; They tell you Rakes and Jilts corrupt a Nation: —Such is the Prejudice of Education! You, who know better Things, will sure approve These Scenes, that show the boundless Power of Love. Let, when they will, th'Italian Things appear, This Play, we trust, shall throng an Audience here. Bold Myron's Passion, up to Frensy wrought, Would ill be warbled through an Eunuch's Throat: His Part, at least, his Part requires a Man; Let Nicolini act it if he can. FINIS.</field>
