      <field name="fulltext">[THE FIRST TRAGEDIE OF SENECA ENTITVLED Hercules Furens.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mercurij nutrices, horæ</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT VVORSHIPFVL, SIR THOMAS HENNEAGE KNIGHT, TREASVRER OF HER MAIESTIES CHAMBER: Thomas Newton wisheth all abundaunce of Felicitie, and Spirituall benedictions in Christe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument of this Tragedy. Ivno the Wyfe and sister of Iupiter, hating his bastard broode, cometh dovvne from heauen, complayning of all his iniuries done to her, deuising also by vvhat despight she may vexe his base Sonne Hercules. And hauing by experience proued, no toyles to be to hard for him, findeth the meanes to make his ovvne hand his ovvne vengeance. Hercules therefore returning novv from Hell (from vvhence he vvas enioyned to fet Cerberus) and finding that the Tyrant Lycus had inuaded his co?trey, destroieth the tyrant. For the vvhich victory as hee sacrificeth to his Goddesse, vvrathfull Iuno strikes him into a sodayne frensy: Wherevvith he beinge sore vexed, thynking to slea the Children and Wyfe of Lycus, in steede of them, killeth his ovvne Wyfe and Children in his madnes. This done hee sleapeth. Iuno restoreth to him agayne his Wits. He being vvakt, seing his Wyfe and Children slayne by his ovvne hand, at last also vvould kill himselfe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SPEAKERS Iuno. Chorus. Megara. Amphitrion. Lycus. Hercules. Theseus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST ACTE. Iuno alone. I syster of the Thunderer, (for now that name alone Remaynes to me) Ioue euermore as though deuorst and gone, And temples of the highest ayre as wydowe shunned haue, And beaten out of skyes aboue the place to Harlots gaue. I must go dwell beneath on ground, for Whoores do hold the sky. From hence the Beare in parte aboue of ycy peale full hy, A haughty starre the greekish shyps by Seas doth guyde about: From this way, whence at spring time warme the day is loased out, Europaes bearer through the waues of Tyria shynes full bright. From thence, their stormy fearefull flocke to Ships, and seas affright, The wandring daughters here and there of Atlas vpward sway. With staring bush of hayre from hens Orion Gods doth fray: And Perseus eke his glitteryng starres of golden glosse hath here. From hence the twynnes of Tyndars stocke do shine, a signe full clere: And at whose byrth first stode the grounde that erst went to and fro. Nor onely Bacchus now himselfe, or Bacchus mother lo, Haue clymd to Gods: least any parte should from rebuke be free, The skies the Gnossian strumpets crownes do beare in spight of mee. But I of old c?temptes complayne: me, one dire, fierce, and shrewde, Thebana land with wicked broode of Ioues base daughters strewde, How oft hath it a stepdame made? though vp to heauen should ryse, The conqueryng drabbe Alcmena now, and hold my place in skyes, And eke her sonne to promisd starres obtayne the worthy way, At byrth of whom the staying worlde so long deferd the day, And Phœbus slow from morning sea began to glister bright, Commaunded long in th'Ocean waues to hyde his drowned lyght. Yet shall my hates not leaue them so, a wrathful kindled rage His mynd in madnes shall stirre vp, and yre that may not swage Shall euermore (all peace layd downe) wage warres eternally. What warres? what euer hideous thinge the earth his ennemy Begets, or what soeuer sea or ayre hath brought to syght Both dredfull, dire, and pestilent, of cruel fiercest might, T'is tierd and tam'd: he passeth all, and name by ills doth rayse, And all my wrath he doth inioy, and to his greater prayse He turnes my hates: whyle tedious toyles to much I him behest, He proues what father him begot: both thence where light opprest Hath sea, and where it showde agayne, where Titan day doth trayne, And with his brand approaching nere doth dye those Aethiops twaine, His strengh vntamde is honoured: and God eche where is hee Now calde in worlde, and now more store of monsters want to mee, And laboure lesse to Hercles is t'acomplish all my will, Then me to bydde: at ease he doth myne imperies fulfyl. What cruel hestes of tyrante now so fyerce a yong man may Preuayle to hurt? for lo he beares for weapons now awaye What once he feerde, and put to flight: he armed comes at syde With Lyon fyerce and Hydra both: nor land suffiseth wyde, But broake he hath the threshold loe of that infernall Ioue, And spoyls with him of conquerd king he drawes to Gods aboue. But thats but light, broke is the league of sprites that there do dwell. I saw my selfe, I saw him lo (the night now gone, of hell And Ditis tamde) throw out abroade before his fathers sight His brothers spoyles. Why drawes he not opprest and bound by might Hymselfe in chaynes that equall thynges to Ioue by lot doth hold? And beare the rule of captiue hel, and way to Styxe vnfolde? Up opened is from lowest ghostes the backward way to skye, And sacred secrets of dire death in open sight do lye. But he (the dredful den of sprites brake vp ful fierce and stout Euen ouer mee doth tryumph lo, and with proude hand about The foule blacke dogge by Grekish townes he leades fr? hel away. When seene was vgly Cerberus I saw the fading day, And fearefull sunne: euen me lykewyse a trembling dread opprest, And looking on the fylthy neckes of conquerd monstruous beast, I feared much myne owne behestes: but light things I complayne, For heauen I may be frayde, lest he may get the highest rayne, That lowest wonne, the sceptors from his father wil he take, Nor hee to starres (as Bacchus dyd) his way wil gently make: The way with ruine will he seeke, and hee in empty skyes Wil reygne alone with force displayd hys haughty hart doth ryse, And he that heauen it selfe by force of his might gotted bee, It bearyng learnd: quite vnderneth the world his head set hee. Nor once his shoulders bowde the prayse of such a mighty mas: And midst of heauen on Hercles necke alone (loe) setled was. His necke vnwryde the starres aboue and skyes did only stay: And me likewyse oppressyng him, to Gods he seekes the way. Goe ire, goe on, and beate hym downe that great things doth inuent Match thou with him, and with thy handes now thou thy selfe him rent. Such hates why dost thou meditate? let all wyld beastes now go: And weary Euristheus now be free from geeuing charges mo. The Tytans daryng once of Ioue to breake the impery Send out: let loase the denne abroade of mount of Sicilye. The Doricke land that with the turne of gyant quakes afrayd, Let it bring forth the dredful neckes of monster vnder layd. Let yet the haughty moone aboue some other beastes beget, But these he ouercame. Seekes thou a match t'Alcides yet? Thers none, except hymselfe: let him agaynst himselfe rebell. Let present be from bottome deepe vpraysd of lowest hell Th'Eumenides, let flaming lockes of theyrs the fires out flinge, And furious hands bestowe aboute the stroakes of vipers sting. Go now ful prowde, and scale the skyes to seates of gods make waye. Now must thy battels wages be ful cleere loe shynes the daye. Despyse mans workes thinkst thou fierce wight yt hell and soules alow Thou hast escapt? nay here I wil another hel thee show. In deepe miste hid I will call vp from bottome low of hell Beyond the wayes of gylty ghostes debateful goddesse fell. Wheras the roaring dreadful den resoundes with cryes about. From depest bond of Ditis raygne beneath I wil set out, What so is left. Let hateful hurt now come in anger wood, And fierce impyety imbrew himselfe, with his owne bloud, And errour eke, and fury arm'd agaynst it selfe to fight. This meane, this meane, let wrath of myne now vse to shewe my might. Beginne ye seruantes now of hell: the feruent burning tree Of Pyne shake vp: and set with snakes her dreadful flocke to see. Let now Megæra bring to sight, and with her mournful hand For burning rage bring out of hell a huge and direful brand. Do this, require you vengeance due, and paynes of hel his spoyle, Strike through his breast, let fyercer flame, within his bosome boyle. Then which in Aetna fornace beates, so furiously to see. That mad of mind and witles may Alcides driuen bee With fury great through pearced quight, my selfe must first of all Be mad. Wherfore doth Iuno yet not into raging fall? Mee, me, ye Furyes, systers three throwne quite out of my wit Tosse fyrst, if any thing to do, I do endeuour yet For stepdame meete: let now my hates be turnd another way, Let him (returnd) his babes behold in safety I you pray. And strong of hand come home, I haue now found the day at length, In which may greatly mee auayle the hated Hercles strength. Both mee and eke hym selfe let him subdue and wish to die Returnd from hel, yea let it here be my commodity, That he of Ioue begotten is: here present wil I stand, And that his shaftes goe streyght from bow, I wil direct his hand; The mad mans weapons will I guide, euen Hercles fyghtyng, lo, At length Ile ayde. This gylt once done then leefull is that so His father may admit to skies those gylty handes of his Chorus. The fading starres now shyne but seelde in sighte In stipye skye, night ouercome with day Plucks in her fyres, while spronge agayne is light. The day starre drawes the cleresome beames theire waye, The ycye signe of haughtye poale agayne, VVith seuen starres markt, the Beares of Arcadye, Do call the light with ouerturned wayne. VVith marble horse now drawne, hys waye to hye Doth Titan toppe of Oetha ouer spred The bushes bright that nowe with berryes bee Of Thebes strewde, by daye do blushe full redde. And to returne doth Phœbus syster flee. Now labor harde beginnes, and euerye kynde Of cares it styrres, the Shepehearde doth vnfolde: His flockes vnpende, do grase their foode to fynde, And nippes the grasse with hoary frost full colde. At will doth play in open medow faire The Calfe whose brow did damme yet neuer teare, The empty Kyne their vdders doe repayre. And lyght with course vncertayne here and there, In grasse full soft the wanton kidde hee flynges. In toppe of boughe doth sitte with chaunting songe, And to the Sunne newe rose to spreade her wynges, Bestirres herselfe her mourneful nestes amonge The Nightingall: and doth with byrdes aboute Confuse resound mith murmure mixed ryfe To witnes day; his sayles to wynde set out The shypman doth committe in doubt of lyfe. VVhyle gale of wynde the slacke sayles filles full strayte, He leaning ouer hollow rocke doth lye, And either his begiled hookes doth bayte, Or els beholdes and feeles the pray from hye with paised hand. The trembling fish he feeles with line extent. This hope to them to whom of hurtles lyfe. Is quiet rest, and with his owne content, And lytle, house, such hope in fieldes is ryfe The troblous hopes with rolling whirlewynd great, And dredful feares their wayes in cityes keepe. He proude repayre to prince in regall seate, And hard court gates without the rest of sleepe Esteemes, and endles happynes to hold Doth gather goods, for treasure gaping more, And is ful pore amid his heaped gold. The peoples fauour him (astonied sore) And commons more vnconstant then the sea, VVith blast of vayne renoume liftes vpfull proude. He selling at the brawling barre his plea, Full wicked, sets his yres and scoulding loud And woordes to sale, a fewe hath knowne of all The careles rest, who mindfull how doth flitte Swift age away, the tyme that neuer shall Returne agayne do holde: while fates permitte, At quiet liue: the lyfe full quickly glydes VVith hastned course, and with the winged day The wheele is turnde of yere that hedlong slides, The sisters hard perfourme their taskes alway, Nor may agayne vntwist the threede once sponne, Yet mankind loe vnsure what way to take To meete the greedy destenyes doth ronne And willingly wee seke the Stigian lake. To much Alcides thou with stomacke stoute The sory sprites of hell dost hast to see. VVith course prefixt the fates are brought aboute To none once warnd to come may respite bee To none to passe their once appointed day, The tombe all people calde by death doth hyde Let glory him by many landes awaye Display, and fame throughout all cityes wyde Full babling praise, and euen with skye to stande Auaunce and starres: let him in chariot bright Ful haughty goe: let me my natiue land In safe and secrete house keepe close from sight.

      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND ACTE. Megara. O guider great of heauen, &amp; of the world O Iudge full hie, Yet now at length apoinct a meane of carefull miserie, And ende of our calamitie. To mee yet neuer day Hath careles shin'de: the ende of one affliction past away Beginning of an other is: an other ennemy Is forthwith founde, before that hee his ioyfull family Retourne vnto an other fyght hee taketh by behest: Nor any respite giuen is to him nor quiet rest: But whyle that he commaunded is: straight him pursueth shee The hatefull Iuno. Was yet once from toyle and labour free His infants age? the monsters (lo) he vanquisht hath and slayne, Before he knew what monsters ment. The skaled serpents twayne Their double neckes drew on toward him, agaynst the which to ryse, The infant crept to meete with them, the serpents glittring eyes Lyke fyre, with quiet carelesse brest he looking fast vpon, With co?tnance cleere, hard wrested knots of them he caught anon: And strangling then the swelling throates of them with tender hand, To Hydra prelude made the beast so swyfte of Mænale land, That with much Golde bare vp full bright his beautifled head, Is caught in course of Nemey wood likewise the greatest dread The Lyon prest with Hereles armes hath roarde with dreadfull crie. What should I speake of stables dyre, of steedes of Bystonye? Or King cast out himselfe for foode his horses fierce to fill? And bristled beast in thicke tops woont of Erymanthus hill? The boare of Mænalye, the woods of Arcady to shake? And Bull that did no litle dread to hundred peoples make? Among the flocks of Hesper lande that hence farre distant bee, The sheepherde of Cartesian coast of triple shape to see Is slayne, and driuen is the pray from farthest parte of weast, Citheton quak't when by him past to sea the well knowne beast. He being bid to make by coastes of sommer sunne his way, And parched landes which sore with heate doth boyle the middell day, The mountaynes brake on either side and rampiers all vndoon, Euen vnto swyft and raging sea hath made a way to roon. Then entring in of plenteous wood, the pleasant gardeins gay, The waking dragons golden spoyles with him he brought away. The Lerna monsters numerous ill what neede to tell haue I? Hath he not him with fyre at length subdewde, and taught to dye? And which were woont with wings abrode to hyde the day from sight, Euen from the cloudes he sought &amp; braue the Stimphale birdes to flight. Not him subdewde who euer lyes in bed vnmatcht at night The wyddowe queene of them that tooke to Thermodont their flight. Nor handes that well durst enterprise his noble trauayles all The filthy labour made to shrynke of foule Augias hall. What vayle all these? he wants the world which oft defended he. And th'earth well knowes the worker of his quietnes to be Away from earthe: the prosperous gilt that beareth happy sway, Is vertue callde, and now the good to wicked doe obay. The right doth stand in might of armes, feare treadeth downe the lawe. Before my face with cruell hand, euen presently I sawe Reuengers of theyr fathers reygne, the sonnes with sworde downe cast, And of the noble Cadmus eke himselfe the ofspring last Then slayne: I sawe his regall crowne at once from him away With head bereft. Who Thebes alas enough bewayle nowe may? The fertile land of Gods, what lorde now quakes it for to knowe? Out of the fieldes of which somtime, and fruictfull bosome lowe, The youth vpsprong with sworde in hand preparde to battell stoode: And walls of which Amphion one of mighty Ioue his broode, Hath built with sounding melody in drawing to the stones: To towne of whom the parent chiefe of Gods not onely ones Heauen being left hath come. this land that Gods aboue alway Receiu'de, and which hath made them Gods, and (leefull beete to say) Perhaps shall make, with lothsome yoake of bondage is prest downe. O Cadmus stocke, and citezens of olde Amphions towne, Whereto are yee nowe fall'ne? dread yee a cowardly exull thus, His coastes to dwell in, lacking, and to ours iniurious? Who through the worlde pursues the gilts and wrong by sea and land, And cruell sceptors broken hath with iust and ryghtfull hand, Nowe absent serues, and what he eas'de in other doth sustayne: And now doth bannysht Lycus holde of Hercles Thebes the rayne. Yet shall he not: he shall come home, and him with vengeaunce quight, And sodaine rise to starres: he will soone flnde the way to light, Or make it ells. returne thou safe, repayre to thine in haste: And conquerour to conquer'de house yet come agayne at laste. Ryse vp my spouse, and darknes deepe repell'de of helly shade Breake vp with hand, if no way may for thee kept backe bee made, And passage be shut vp, returne with world vprent by might. And what soeuer li'the possest byneath in darkest night, Send out with thee, as when the tops of haughty hylles vndoon A headlong passage making through for hasty floude to roon Thou somtime stoodst, wh? with great might of thyne a sunder broake The Tempye woods wyde open lay: and beaten with thy stroake The mount, now here, now there fell downe: and [illeg.]amp[illeg.]er rente of slay, The raging brooke of Thessaly did roon a newe found way, Thy parentes so, thy sonnes, thy land repayring home to see, Breake out, and lowest bonde of things out bringing thence with thee, And what soeuer greedy age in all these long yeares race Hath hid, shew forth, &amp; ghosts that haue forgot theyr former case, And people vp before thee driue that fearefull are of light. Unworthy spoyles for thee they are, if thou but bring to sight What bidden is. great thinges, but farre to much I speake for mee, Unwotting of myne owne estate. when shall I hap to see, The day when thee, and thy right hand, I may embrace agayne, And slowe returnes, nor yet of me once myndefull, may complayne? To thee for this O guide of Gods, vntamed Bulls shall bring Their hundred necks: to thee O Queene of fruits on earth that spring I'le geue thee secret sacrifice: to thee with much fayth loe Long fyre brands at Eleusis towne full silent wyll I throe. Then to my brethren shall I thinke to bee restoarde agayne Theyr soules, and eke himselfe aliue and guiding of his rayne My father for to flouryshe yet. if any greater might Doe keepe thee shet, we followe thee: with thy returne to sight Defend vs all, or els to hell drewe downe vs all to thee. Thou shalt vs drawe, no God shall rayse vs vp that broken bee. AMPHITRYON, MEGARA. O faythfull fellowe of our bloud, with chaste true faythfulnes The [illeg.]ed keeping, and the sonne of haughty Hercules, Conceiue in mynde some better thinges, and take good heart to thee: He will come home, as after all his labours woonteth hee, Of more renowned ME. What wretches doe most chiefly wishe of all, They soone beleue. AM. Nay what they feare to much lest it may fall, They thinke it, neuer may bee shoon'de, nor rid by remedy. ME. Beleefe is ready still to dreade the woorser mysery. Deepe drown'de, &amp; whellm'de, &amp; farthermore with all ye world full lowe Oppressed downe, what way hath he to light agayne to goe? AM. What way I pray you had he then wh? through the burning coste, And tumbling after maner of the troubled Sea vp toste He went by sands: and freate that twyse with ebbe away doth slip, And twyse vpflowe: and when alone with his forsaken ship, Fast caught he stucke in shallowe foordes of shelfye Syrtes sande, And (nowe his ship on grounde) did passe through seas a foote to land? ME. Iniurious fortune vertue most of men most stout and strong Doth seldome spare: no man alyue himselfe in safety long To perills great and daungers may so often times out cast, Whom chaunce doth often ouerslip, the same it findes at last. But cruell loe, and greeuous threats euen bearing in his face, And such as he of stomacke is, doth come euen such of pace, Proude Lycus who the sceptors shakes in hande of other king, The plentuous places of the towne of Thebes gouerning, And euery thinge about the whych with fertile soyle doth goe Sloape Phocis, and what euer doth Ismenus ouerfloe, What euer thing Cithæron seeth with haughty top and hye, And slender Isthmos Ile, the which betweene two seas doth lye. Lycus. Megara. Amphitrion. Not I of natiue countrey bowres possesse the auncient right Unworthy heir, nor yet to me are noble men of might The grandfathers, nor stocke renownd with titles hie of name, But noble vertue: who so boastes of kinred whence he came, Of others vertue makes his vaunt, but got with fearful hand My sceptors are obtaynd: in sword doth all my safety stand. What thee thou wotst agaynst the will of cytesyns to get, The bright drawne sword must it defend: in forrayne countrey set No stable kingdome is. But one my pompe and princely might May ratify once ioynd to me with regall torche ful bright, And chambers Megara: of stocke of such nobility Let vpstart state of myne take shape. I do not thinke that shee Refuse it will, or in the bed with mee despyse to lye. But if with proude vnbridled mynde shee stubburn do denye, Then quite I purpose to destroy the house of Hercules The hate of men will then my pryde, and peoples speach oppres. Chiefe knacke of kingdome is to beare thy subiectes hates eche one. Lets proue her then, chaunce geuen hath to vs a place alone. For shee her head in fold of vayle ful sad and wofully Enwrapt the Gods that are her guides for succour standes fast by, And at the syde of her doth leane Alcides father trewe. Meg. What thing doth this destroyer of our stocke agayne anew Prepare? what proueth he? Ly. O Queene that name renowmed hye And tytle takste of regall stocke ful gentle and easily A litle whyle receiue and heare my wordes with pacient eare, If alwayes men eternal hates should one to th'other beare, And rage be gone out of the hart should neuer fall away, But th'happy still should armour holde, th'vnhappy stil obay, Then shall the battayles nothing leaue: with wide fieldes then the lande Shall lie vntild, with vnderlayd to housen fiery brand Then ashes deepe shal ouerwhelme the buried people all. Expedient is to conquerour to wish that peace befall: To conquerd nedefull partner of the kingdome come to me: Let's ioyne our myndes, take here this pledge of fayth and truth to thee. My right hand touch. Why whishtest thou with cruell face and moode? Meg. Should I abyde, that I the hand sprinkt with my fathers bloud, Should ouch, and double death imbrewd of both my brethren? nay Fyrst shall sunne ryse extinguish quite, and West shal bring the day: First faythful peace betweene the snowes and fiers there shalbe tryde, And Scilla shall t'Ausonius fyrst ioyne his Sicilian syde: And fyrst, the fleetyng floud that with swift turnes of course doth flowe Euripus with Euboik waue shall standful stil and slow. My father, th'empire, bretherne, house, thou hast me cleare bereft, My countrey to: what may be more? one thing to me is left, Then brother, father, kingdome, house, that dearer is to mee The hate of thee, the which to me with people for to be In commune woe I am: how great is myne alonly part? Rule on ful proude, beare vp ful hye thy sprites and haughty hart: Yet God the proude behynd theyr backes doth follow them to wreake. I know the Thebane kingdomes: what should I the mothers speake, Both suffring, and aduentring gyltes? what double mischiefe done? And mixed name of spouse at once, of father and of sonne? What bretherns double tentes? or what as many roages also? The mother proude of Tantals brood congeald in mourning loe, And sory stone yet flowes with teares in Phrygian Sipylye. Himselfe likewyse erected vp his scaled heade awrye. Euen Cadmus measuring throughout th'Illyrian landes in flight, Behynd him left of body drawne long slymy markes in sight. All these examples wayte for thee: rule thou as likes thy will, Whyle thee our kingdomes wonted fates do call and oft hap yll. Ly. Goe to, these fierce and furious wordes thou woman mad refraine. And imperyes of princes learne of Hercles to sustayne. Though I the scepters gotten by the force of war do beare, In conquering hand &amp; all do rule without the law his feare. Which armes subdue, a few wordes yet to thee now speake I shall For this my cause thy father did in bloudy battel fall: Thy brethren fell, the weapons kepe no measurable slay. For neither easily tempred be, nor yet repressed may The drawne swordes yre, the battels doth the bloud delite out shedde. But he yet for his kingdome fought, wee altogether led With wicked lust: yet th'end of war is now complayned, loe, And not the cause, but now let all remembraunce therof goe: When conquerour hath weapons left, the conquerds part should be To leaue his hates. Not I that thou with lowly bended knee Mee raygning worship should'st, require: euen this doth mee delight, That thou thy myseries do'st beare with mynde so stout vpright. Thou for a king a spouse art meete, let's ioyne our beds anone. ME. A trembling colde doth run throughout my bloudles lims ech one. What hainous thinge comes to myne eares? I fear'de not then at all, When (all peace broake) the noyse of warre did by the city wall Resounde about, I bare all that vnfearefully to see, I feare the wedding chambers: nowe I captiue seeme to mee. Let heauy chaynes my body greeue, and eke with hunger long Let lingring death be slowly brought, yet shall no force full strong My truthe subdue: for euen thine owne Alcides will I dye. LY. Doth then thy husband droun'de in hell geue thee this stomack hie? ME. The hells alowe he toucht, that he the height againe might get. LY. The heauy paise oppresseth him of all the earth full great. ME. Hee with no burdein shall be prest, that heauen it selfe sustayn'de. LY. Thou shalt be forst. ME. He wots not how to die, that is c?strain'd. LY. Speake, what may rather I prepare then wedding newe for thee. More royall gyft? ME. Thine owne death els, or els the death of mee. LY. Thou shalt mad woman die. ME. I shall then to my husbande go. LY. More then my Sceptors is to thee a seruaunt loued so? ME. How many hath this seruant slayne of kings with hendy stroake? LY. Why doth he yet a king then serue, and still sustayne his yoake? ME. Take once away the hard behests, what's vertue then at last? LY. Do'st thou it vertue counte, to bee to beasts, and monsters cast? ME. T'is vertues part, to tame the things, that all men quake to know. LY. Him great things bragg?g, darknes deepe of tartare presse ful low. ME. There neuer may from ground to stars an easy passage be. LY. Of whom begot, the housen then of Gods through pearceth he? AM. O wretched wife of Hercles great, thy words a whyle now spare. My parte it is, the father of Alcides to declare, And his true stocke, yet after all of man so stoute as this So famous deedes, and after all appeas'de with hand of his What euer Titan rysen vp, doth see, or els at fall, And after all these monsters tam'de, and Phlegrey sprinkled all With wicked bloud, and after Gods defended all on hye, Is not his father yet well knowne? or Ioue doe we beelye? Beleeue it yet by Iunoes hate. LY. Why do'ste thou sclaunder Ioue? No mortall kinred euer may be mixt with heauen aboue. AM. To many of the Gods in skyes is this a common trade. LY. But were they euer seruauntes yet, before they Gods were made? AM. Of Delos Ile the sheepherde loe the flocks of Pherey fed. LY. But through all coasts he wandred not abroade as banished. AM. Wh? straying mother first brought forth in w?dring lond to sight? LY. Yet Phœbus did no monsters feare, or beasts of cruell might. AM. First Dragon with his bloud embrew'd the shafts of Phœbus lo. Howe greeuous ills euen yet full yong he bare, doe you not knoe? From mothers wombe ye babe out thrown with lightning flame fr? hie, Euen next his lightning Father stoode forthwith aboue in skye. What? he him selfe that guides the starres, &amp; shakes the clouds at will, Did not that Infant lurke in Den of hollowe caued hill? The byrthes so great full troublous pryce to haue loe alwayes ought: And euer to be borne a God, with coste full great is bought. LY. Whom thou a miser see'st, thou mai'st know him a man to bee. AM. A miser him deny yee may, whom stout of heart yee see. LY. Call we him stout, from shoulders hye of whom the Lyon throwne A gift for mayden made, and eke his Club from hand fell downe, And paynted side with purple weede did shyne that he did weare? Or may we him call stout of heart, whose staring lockes of heare With ointm?t flowde? who hands renownde &amp; knowne by prayses hye To sound vnmeete for any man of timber did applye, With barbarous mytar cloasing in his forhead rounde about? AM. The tender Bacchus did not blushe abroade to haue layde out His brayded heares, nor yet with hand full soft the Thyrsus light For to haue shooke, what time that he with pace vnstout in sight His long train'de barbarous garment drew with golde full fayre to see. Still vertue after many workes is woont releast to bee. LY. Of this the house of Euritus destroyde doth witnesse beare, And virgins flockes that brutishly by him oppressed weare. No Iuno did commaunde him this, nor none Eurystheus loe. But these in deede his owne workes are. AM. Yet all yee doe not knoe, His worke it is, with weapons of his owne hand vanquished Both Eryx, and to Eryx ioyn'de Antæus Lybian ded: And aulters which with slaughter of the straungers flowing fast, Busyris well deserued bloud likewise haue drunke at last. His deede it is, that he that met the wounde, and sworde is slayne Constrain'de to suffre death before those other Geryons twayne. Nor one all onely Geryon doth with one hand conquer'de lye. Thou shalt among these be which yet with none adulterye Haue wedlocke hurt. LY. What is to Ioue, to king is leefull thyng: To Ioue thou gau'ste a wyfe, thou shalt nowe geue one to a kyng. And euen of thee shee shall it learne to bee a thing not newe, Her husband euen approuing it the better man t'ensewe. But if shee stubberne to be matcht with me deny it still, Then euen by force a noble childe of her beget I will. Meg. O Creons ghosts and all yee Gods of th'house of Labdacus, And wedding torches blasing bryght, of wicked Oedipus, To this my wedding geue yee nowe our wonted destenyes. Now, now yee bloudy daughters all of Ægypts king likewyse, Bee here whose hands defyled are with so much bloud out spilt: One daughter lacks of Danaus, I wyll fyll vp the gylt. Ly. Because that stubburnely thou do'st refuse my wedding so, And fear'ste a king, thou shalt know what the Scepters now may do. Embrace thyne aulters, yet no God shall euer take away Thee from my hands: no not although with world vpturned, may Alcides victor yet agayne to Gods aboue returne. The woods on heapes together cast, let all their temples burne Euen throwne vpon theyr heads: his wyfe, and all his flocke at laste With vnderlayed fyre, let one wood pyle consume and waste. AM. This only bowne I father of Alcides aske of thee, Which well may me beseeme to craue, that I fyrst slayne may bee. LY. Who all appoyncts with present death to haue their punishment, He tyrant wots not how to be: more sundry greeues inuent. Restrayne the wretched man from death, commaunde that th'happy dye. I, while with beames prepar'de to burne the pyle encreaseth hye, Will him with vowing sacrifyce that rules the seas entreate. AM. Oh chiefest powre of Gods, and oh of heauenly things so great The guyde, and parent eke, with whose throwne thunderbolts do shake All things humane throughout the world of king so cruell slake The wicked hande: but why do I to Gods in vayne thus cry? Where euer thou be, heare me soone, why start so sodaynely The temples thus with moouing shakte? Why roareth out the gro?d? The noyse of Hell from bottome deepe byneathe hath made a sound: Wee herde are, loe it is the sound of Hercules his pace. Chorus. O fortune hating men of stoutest brest, How ill rewards dost thou to good deuyde? Eurystheus raynes at home in easy rest, Alcmenaes sonne in euery battayle tryde, To Monsters turnes hys hande that Skyes dyd stay: And cruell Neckes cuts of, of hydous Snake, And Apples brynges from Systers mokt away, When once to sleepe hys watchefull Eyes beetake, Dyd Dragon set ryche fruicte to ouersee. Hee past the Scythian bowres that straye abroade, And those that in their countreys straungers bee And hardned top of frosen freate hee troade, And sylent Sea with bankes full dumme about. The Waters hard want there their floudes to sloe. And where before the Shyps full Sayles spred out Is worne a pathe for Sarmates wylde to goe. The Sea doth stande to mooue in course agayne, Nowe apt to beare the Ship, nowe horsemen bolde The Queene that there doth ouer Wydowes rayne, That gyrds her Wombe wyth gyrth of glittring gold, Her noble spoyle from body drawne hath shee And shyelde, and bandes of breast as whyte as snowe, Acknowledging the Conquerour with Knee. Wyth what hope drawne to headlong Hell alowe, So bolde to passe the vnreturned wayes Saw'ste thon Proserpines rayne of Sicylye? Wyth Southern wynde, or Western there no seas Aryse wyth waue and swellinge Surges hye. Not there of Tyndars stocke the double broode Two starres the fearefull Shyps doe ayde and guide. Wyth gulph full blacke doth stande the slouthfull floode And when pale death with greedy teeth so wyde. Vnnumbred Nations hath sent downe to sprightes Wyth one Boateman all ouer feryed bee. God graunt thou maist of Hell subdue the rightes And vnreuoked webs of Systers three. There kyng of many people raygneth hee, Who when thou did'st wyth Nestors Pylos fight, Pestiferous handes appli'de to matche with thee And weapon bare with triple mace of might: And prickt with litle wounde he fled away, And lorde of death hymselfe did feare to dye. Breake Fate by force: and let the sight of day To sorry sprightes of Hell apparant lye And porche vnpast shew way to Gods aboue. The cruell lordes of sprightes wyth pleasaunt song And humble bownefull well could Orpheus moue, Whyle he Eurydicen them craues among. The Arte that drew Woods, Byrds, and stones at will: Which made delay to Floudes of flitting flight At sound whereof the sauage Beastes stoode still With tunes vnwont doth Ghosts of hell delight And clearer doth resounde in darker place: And weepe wyth teares did Gods of cruell brest: And they which faultes with to seuere a face Doe seeke, and former gylt of Ghosts out wrest: The Thracian Daughters wayls Eurydicen. For her the Iudges weeping sit also. Wee conquer'de are, chyefe kyng of death sayd then To Gods (but vnder this condition) goe, Behynde thy husbandes backe keepe thou thy way, Looke thou not backe thy Wyfe before to see. Than thee to sight of Gods hath brought the day And gate of Spartane Tænare present bee. Loue hates delay, nor coulde abyde so long. His gyft, hee lost, while hee desires the syght. The place that coulde be thus subdew'de with song That place may soone bee ouercome by myght.</field>

Oh sonne, the sure and sauegard late of Thebes in misery, See I thy body true indeede? or els deceiu'de am I Mockt with thy sprite? art thou ye same? these brawnes of armes I know And shoulders, and thy noble handes from body hie that grow.

All ryght of worlde, and thee lykewyse I praye ye bearst the rayne In kingdome wyde, and thee, for whom all round about in vayne Thy mother throughout Ætna sought, that secret things alowe And hid in ground, it freely may bee lawfull for to showe. The Spartane land a noble toppe of hyll aduaunceth hye, Where Tænarus with woods full thick the Sea doth ouerly. The house of hatefull Ditis here his mouth doth open set, And rocke of hyll aboue doth gape, and with a denne full gret A huge and gaping cleft of ground with Iawes full wyde doth lye, And way full broade to people all doth spred to passe thereby. Not straight with darkenes doth begin the way that blindes the sight. A litle lingring brightnes loe behinde of late left light, And doubtfull glittring yet of sonne afflicted falles alowe, And mocks the sight: such light is wont vndoubtedly to showe The dawne of day, or twylight els at edge of euening tyde. From hence to hollowe places voyde are loaste the spaces wyde, To which needes peryshe must all kinde of men that once are throwne. Nor it a labour is to goe, the way it selfe leades downe. As oft the ships agaynst theyr willes doth tosse the swelling surge, So downward doth that headlong way, and greedy Chaos vrge: And backe agayne to drawe thy pace thee neuer doe permit The sprits who what they catch hold fast. alowe within doth flit In chanell wyde with silent foorde the quiet lake of lethe, And cares doth rid: and that there may to scape agayne from death No meane be made, with many turnes and windings euery way Foldes in his floude. in such sorte as with waue vnsure doth play Mæander wandring vp and downe, and yeldes himselfe vnto, And doubtfull stands, if he toward banke, or backe to spryng may goe. The foule and filthy poole to see of slowe Cocytus lyes. On th'one the Grype, on th'other side the mournefull Howlet cries, And sad lucke of th'vnhappy Strix likewise resoundeth there. Full vglily in shady bowes blacke Locks of lothsome heare, Where Taxus tree doth ouer leane, which holdeth slouthfull sleepe, And hunger sad with famisht Iawe that lyes his place to keepe, And shame to late doth hide his face that knowes what crimes it hath, Both feare, and quaking, funerall, and fretting raging wrath, And mourning dyre doth follow on, and trembling pale disease, And boystrous battayles set with sworde: and hid beyond all thease Doth slouthfull age his lingring pace help forth with staffe in hand. AM. Of corne and wyne in hell alowe is any fertile land? TH. No ioyfull Meades do there bring forth with face so greene &amp; fayre, Nor yet with gentill Zephyrus wagges ripened corne in th'ayre, Nor any tree hath there such bowes as doe bryng apples out. The barrayne compasse of deepe foyle full filthy lyes about, And withred with eternall drought the lothsome land doth waste And bond full sad of thinges, and of the worlde the places laste: The ayre vnmoued stands, and night sits there full darke to see In slouthfull world, all thinges by dread full horrible there bee. And euen farre worse then death it selfe, is place where death doth bide. AM. What? he that doth those places darke with regall sceptor guide, In what seate set, doth he dispose and rule those peoples light? TH. A place there is in turne obscure of Tartarus from sight, Which mist full thick with fearefull shade doth holde and ouergoe. From hence a double parted streame from one wellspring doth floe: The tone, much like a standing poole (by this the gods doe sweare) The which the sacred Stygian lake with silent floude doth beare: The t'other fierce with tumult great is drawen his course to goe, And Acheron with raging floud the stones dryues to and froe Unsaylable. with double foorde is rounde about beset Agaynst it Ditis pallace dyre, and mansion house full gret In shadefull woode is couered: from wide den here the posts And thresholds of the tyrant hang, this is the walke of ghosts: This of his kingdome is the gate: a fielde about it goes, Where sitting with a countnaunce proude abroade he doth dispose Newe soules. a cruell maiesty is in the God to knowe: A frowning forehead, which yet of his brethren beares the showe, And so great stocke: there is in him of Ioue the very face, But when he lightens: and great part of cruell kingdomes place, Is he himselfe the lorde thereof: the sight of whom doth feare, What euer thing is fear'de. AM. Is fame in this poynct true, yt there Such rygours are, and gilty Ghosts of men that there remayne Forgetfull of theyr former faulte, haue there deserued payne? Who is the rector there of ryght, and iudge of equity? TH. Not onely one extorter out of faultes in seate set hye The iudgements late to trembling soules doth there by lot awarde: In one appoyncted iudgement place is Gnossian Minos harde, And in an other Radamanthe: this crime doth Aeac heare. What eche man once hath done, he feeles: and guilt to th'author theare Returnes, and th'hurtfull with their owne example punisht bee. The bloudy cruell captaynes I in pryson shet did see, And backe of tyrant impotent euen with his peoples hande All torne and cut. what man of might with fauour leades his lande, And of his owne lyfe lorde reserues his hurtlesse handes to good, And gently doth his empyre guide without the thyrst of blood, And spares his soule, he hauing long led forth the lingring dayes Of happy age, at length to heauen doth eyther finde the wayes, Or ioyfull happy places ells of fayre Elysius woode. Thou then that here must be a iudge abstayne from man his bloode, Who so thou be that raygnest kyng: our gyltes are there acquit In greater wyse. AM. Doth any place prescript of lymite shit The gylty Ghosts, and as the fame reportes, doth cruell payne The wicked men make tame that in eternall bondes remayne? TH. Ixion roll'de on whyrling wheele is tost and turned hye: Upon the necke of Sisyphus the mighty stone doth lye. Amyd the lake with thyrsty Iawes olde Tantalus therein Pursues the waues, the water streame doth wet and washe his chin, And when to him nowe ofte deceyu'de it doth yet promise make, Straight flits the floud: the fruicte at mouth his famyne doth forsake, Eternall foode to fleeing foule doth Tytius hart geue still: And Danaus daughters doe in vayne theyr water vessells fill. The wicked Cadmus daughters all goe raging euery way: And there doth greedy rauening byrde the Phiney tables fray. AM. Nowe of my sonne declare to me the noble worthy fight. Brings he his willing vnckles gyft, or Plutoes spoyles to sight? TH. A dyre and dredfull stone there is the slouthfull foordes fast bye, Where sluggish freat with waue aston'd full dull and slowe doth lye: This lake a dredfull fellow keepes both of attire and sight, And quaking Ghosts doth ouer beare an aged vgly wyght: His Bearde vnkempt, his bosome foule deform'de in filthy wyse A knot byndes in, full lothesome stand in head his hollowe eyes: He Feary man doth steare about his Boate with his long Ore. He driuing nowe his lightned Ship of burden towarde the Shore, Repayres to waues: and then his way Alcides doth requyre, The flocke of Ghosts all geuing place: alowde cryes Charon dyre, What way attemptest thou so bolde? thy hastening pace here stay. But Nathales Alemenaes sonne abyding no delay, Euen with his owne poale bet he dothe full tame the shipman make, And clymes the ship: the barke that coulde full many peoples take, Did yelde to one: he sat, the boate more heauy like to breake Whith shyuering ioyntes on eyther syde the lethey floud doth leake. Then tremble all the monsters huge, the Centaures fierce of myght, And Lapithes, kindled with much wyne to warres and bloudy fight. The lowest Chanelles seeking out of Stygian poole a downe, His Lerney labour sore affright his fertile heads doth drowne. Of greedy Ditis after this doth then the house appere. The fierce and cruell Stygian dogge doth fray the spirites there, The which with great and roaring sounde his heads vpshaking three, The kingdome keepes his vgly head with filth full foule to see The serpentes licke: his hayres be fowle with vypers set among, And at his crooked wrested tayle doth hysse a Dragon longe: Lyke yre to shape. when him he wyst his pace that way to take, His bristle hoyres he lifteth vp with fierce vp bended snake: And sounde sent out he soone perceyues in his applyed eare, Who euen the sprits is wont to sent as soone as stoode more neare The sonne of Ioue, the doubtfull dogge strait couched downe in denne, And eche of them did feare. beholde with dolefull barking then The places dumme he makes a dred, the threatning serpent stout Through all the fieldes about doth hysse: the bawling noyse sent out Of dredfull voyce from triple mouth, euen sprits that happy bee Doth make afrayde. from left side then strayte way vndoeth hee The cruell Iawes, and Lyons head once slayne in Cleon fielde Agaynst him sets, and couer doth himselfe with mighty shielde. And bearing in his conquering hande a sturdy club of Oke, Nowe here, now there he rolleth him about with often stroke: His stripes he doubles: he subdew'de his threates asswaged all, And all his heads the weary dogge at once full lowe let fall, And quite out of the denn he fled. full greatly feared (set In regall throne) both king and queene, and bad him to bee fet. And me likewyse they gaue for gyft to Hercles crauing mee. The monsters heauy neckes with hand then stroaking downe all three, In lynked chayne he byndeth faste forgetting then his strength The dogge the watchefull keeper of the kingdome darke at length Layth downe his eares full sore affray'de: and suffring to be led, And eke acknowledging his lorde, following wyth lowly hed, With tayle that snakes theron doth beare he both his sides doth smight. But after that to Tænare mouth we came, and clearenes bright Had strooke his eyes of light vnknowne, good stomacke yet agayne He takes although once ouercome, and now the happy chayne He raging shakes: he had almost his leader pluckt from place, And headlong backward drawne to hell, and moued from his pace. And euen to my handes Hercles then his eyes did backward cast, Wee both with double ioyned strength the dogge out drawne at last For anger woode, and battells yet attempting all in vayne, Brought vp to world. as soone as he the cleere ayre sawe agayne, And spaces pure of bryght fayre poale had once behelde with eye, The nyght arose: his sight to ground he turned by and by, Cast downe his eyes, and hatefull day forthwith he put to flight, And backward turnd away his looke, and streight with all his might To th'earthe he falles: and vnderneath the shade of Hercles then He hyd his head. therewith there came a great resorte of men With clamour glad, that did the bay about theyr forheads bryng: And of the noble Hercules deserued prayses sing. Chorus. Evrystheus borne with swiftned birth in hast, Did bid to bottome of the Worlde to go: This onely lackt of labours all at last, To spoyle the Kyng of thyrde estate also, The dongeons darke to enter ventred hee, Where as the way to sprits farre of doth bring Full sadde, and woode so blacke and fear'de to bee; But full with flocke full great him following. As great a preasse as flocke in cyties streetes, To see the Playes of Theatre newe wrought: As great as at Eléus thundrer meetes, When Sommer fift the sacred game hath brought: As great as when comes houre of longer night, And willing quiet sleepes to bee extent, Holdes equall Libra Phœbus Charlots light, A sorte the secrete Ceres doe frequent, And from theyr howsen left doe hast to comme, The Atticke priestes the nyghte to celebrate: Such heape is chaste beneath by fieldes so dumme. With age full slowe some taking forth their gate Full sad, and fillde with life so long now led: Some yet doe runne the race of better yeares, The virgins yet vnioynde to Spowses bed, And yonglings eke on whom grow yet no heares And Infant lately taught his mothers name. To these alone, (that they the lesse might feare) Is graunted night to ease with foreborne flame. The rest full sad by darke doe wander theare: As is our mynde, when once away is fled The lyght, when eche man sorry feeles to bee Deepe ouerwhelmde with all the earth his hed. Thick Chaos standes, and darknesse fowle to see, And colour ill of night, and slouthfull state Of silent World, and diuers Cloudes about, Let hoary age vs thyther bring full late. No man comes late to that, whence neuer out, When once hee is come, turne agayne he may. To hast the hard and heauy Fate what vayles? This wandring heape in wyde landes farre away, Shall goe to Ghosts: and all shall geue their sayles To slowe Cocytus all is to thee enclinde, Both what the fall, and rise of sonne doth see: Spare vs that comme, to thee wee death are signde: Though thou be slow, our selues yet haste doe wee. Fyrst houre, that gaue the lyfe, it loast agayne. To Thebes is come the ioyfull day, Your Aulters touch yee humbylly, The fat fayre Sacrifices slay. Maydes myxte with men in cumpany Let them in solempne Flockes goe royle: And nowe wyth yoake layde downe let cease The Tillers of the fertile Soyle. Made is wyth hande of Hercles peace Betweene the morne and Hespers Glade, And where Sonne holding myddle seate, Doth make the Bodyes caste no Shade. What euer grounde is ouerweate Wyth compasse longe of Seas abought, Alcydes laboure taemde full well. Hee ouer Foordes of Tartare brought Returnde appeased beeinge Hell. There is remayning nowe no feare, Nought lyes beyonde the Hell to see. O Priest thy staring Lockes of heare Wrappe in wyth loued Poplar tree.</field>

Then these O father yet agayne May any greater thing, or els more greuous feared be? Am. How great apart is it thou wotst of thy calamity? Her. Take mercy father, lo I lift to thee my humble hands. What meaneth this? my hand fleeth backe, some priuy gylt their standes Whence comes this bloud? or what doth mean flowing wt death of child The shaft imbrewd with slaughter once of Lerney monster kilde? I see my weapons now, the hand I seeke no more to witte. Whose hand could bend this bow but myne? or what right arme but it, Could string the bow that vnto mee euen scantly doth obay? To you I turne: O father deare, is this my gylt I pray? They held their peace: it is myne own. Am. Thy greuous woe is there, The cryme thy stepdames: this mischaunce no falt of thyne hath here. Her. From euery part now father throw in wrath thy thunders mighte, And of thy sonne forgetful now with cruel hand requighte At least thy nephewes, let the world that beares the starrs sounde out. And let both th'one and th'other poale, flyng downe thy flames aboute: And let the bankes of Caspyan sea my bounden body teare, And gredy foule. Wherfore do of Prometheus lacke heare The rockes? with huge and haughty top let now prepared be, Both feeding beastes and foules, the syde of Caucas turne to see, And bare of woods, the yle that bridge of Scithe that therby standes Simplegas ioynes, both here and there let it my bounden handes Stretch out abroade: and when with course return'de accustomd'ly They shall togeather dryue, and shall the rockes tosse vp to skye With bankes togeather beyng thrust, and eke the middle seay, Let me betweene the mountaynes lye vnquiet restlesse stay But building vp with wood throwne on a heaped plie on hie My body thus with wicked bloud besprinct, why burne not I? So, so yt must be done: to hell I Hercles will restore. Am. Not yet his hart astonied lackes his ragyng tumult sore, But wrath hath turnd: and which of rage is property and yre Agaynst himselfe he rageth now Her. The furies places dire And dungeon depe of sprites in hell and place of tormentry To gylty ghostes and banishment yf any yet do lye Beyond Erebus, yet vnknowen to Cerberus and mee, There hyde me ground to farthest bond of Tartarus to see, To tary there Ile goe. O brest of myne to fierce and stoute: Who you my children thus disperst through all my house about, May worthely enough bewayle? in all my euils yet This countnaunce hard can neuer weepe, a sword now hether set: My shaftes reach hether, hyther reach my mighty club also: To thee my weapons breake I will, to thee my sonne a two Ile knappe my bowes, and eke my clubbe, this blocke of heauy wayghte Shal to thy sprites be burned loe: this selfe same quiuer frayght With Lerney shaftes to funerall of thyne shall likewyse goe. Let all my weapons penance pay and you vnhappy to Euen with my weapons burne I wil, O stepdames handes of myne, Th. Who euer yet to ignoraunce hath geuen name of cryme? Her. Ful oftentymes did errour greate the place of gylt obtayne. Th. T'is neede to be a Hercles now, this heape of yll sustayne. Her. Not so, hath shame yet geuen place with fury drowned quight: But peoples all I rather should dryue from my wicked sight. My weapons, weapons Theseus, I quickly craue to mee Withdraw to be restoard agayne: if sound my mynd now bee, Restore to me my weapons if yet last my rage of mynd, Then father flee: for I the waye to death my selfe shal fynde. Am. By sacred holy kynreds rightes, by force and duty all Of both my names; if eyther me thy brynger vp thou call, Or parent els, and (which of good men reuerenced are) By these hoare hayres, I the besech my desert age yet spare, And wery yeares of house falne downe the one as only stay, One onely light to mee, with yls afflicted euery way Reserue thy selfe: yet neuer hath there happ'ned once of thee Fruite of thy toyles: still eyther I the doubtful sea to see Or monsters feard: who euer yet hath bene a cruell king In all the world to ghostes allow, and aulters both hurtinge, Of me is feard: the father of thee absent stil to haue The fruite, the touching, and the sight of thee at length I craue. He. Wherfore I longer should sustayn my life yet in this light, And linger here no cause there is, all good lost haue I quighte, My mynd, my weapons, my renoume, my wife, my sonnes, my handes, And fury to no man may heale and lose from gylty bandes My mynd defyeld: needes must with death be heald so haynous yll. Th. Wilt thou thy father slay? He. Least I shoulde do it die I will. Th. Before thy fathers face? He. I taught him mischief for to see. Th. Thy deedes marking rather that should of al remembred bee, Of this one only cryme I do a pardon of thee craue. Her. Sall he geue pardon to himselfe, that to none els it gaue? I beeing bidden prayse deseru'd, this deede mine owne doth proue. Helpe father now, if eyther els thy piety thee moue, Or els my heauy fate, or els the honour and renowne. Of stained strength, my weapons bringe, let fortune be throwen downe. with my right hand. Th. The prayers which thy father makes to thee Are stronge enough, but yet likewyse with weeping loe of me Be moued yet: aryse thou vp, and with thy wonted myght Subdue thyne yls: now such a mynde vnmeete to beare vpright No euill hap, receyue againe loe now with manhode gret Thou must preuayle euen Hercules forbyd with yre to fret. HE. Alyue, I hurt: but if I dye I take the gylt also. I hast to ridde the world of cryme euen now before me lo A wicked monster cruel, and vntamed fierce and stout Doth wander: now with thy ryght hand beginne to goe aboute A greate affayre, yea more then all thy twyse sixe labours long. Yet stayst thou wretch, that late agaynst the children wast so stronge, And fearful mother now except restoard my weapons bee, Of Thracian Pindus eyther I wil teare downe euery tree, And Bacchus holly woods and tops of mount Cythæron hye Burne with myselfe, and al at once with all their housen I And with the Lordes therof the roofes with goddes of Thebes all The Thebane temples euen vppon my body will let fall: And wyl be hyd in towne vpturnd: if to my shoulders might The walles themselues all cast theron shall fall a burden light, And couerd with seuen gates I shall not be enough opprest, Then all the wayght wheron the worlde in middle part doth rest, And partes the Goddes vppon my head Ile turne and ouerthrow My weapons geue. Am. This word is meete for Hercles father lo With this same arrow slaine behold thy sonne is tombled downe, This weap?s cruell Iuno lo from handes of thyne hath throwne, This same wil I now vse, loe see how leaps with feare afright My wretched harte, and how it doth my careful body smight. The shaft is set therto thou shalt a mischiefe lo do now Both willing it and wotting: tel, what thing commaundest thou? I nothing craue my doloure let in saf'ty standeth now. To kepe my sonne alyue to mee that onely do canst thou O Theseu, yet I haue not scapte great'st feare that happen can Thou canst mee not a miser make, thou mayst a happy man So order euery thyng thou dost, as all thy cause in hand, And faine thou mayst wel know in strayght and doubtful case to stande Thou liu'st, or diest: this slender soule that light is hence to flee, Weried with age and no lesse bet with greuous ils to see, In mouth I holde so slowly to a father with such staye Doth any man geue lyfe? I wil no longer bid delay, The deadly sword throughout my breast to strike I wil apply, Here, here the gylt of Hercules euen sound of mynd shall lye. Her. Forbeare O father now forbeare, withdraw thy hand againe. My manhood yeld thy fathers will, and impery sustaine. To Hercles labours now like wyse, let this one labour goe, Let me yet liue, lift vp from ground th'afflicted lims with woe O Theseu of my parent: for from Godly touch doth flee My wicked hand. Am? I gladly do this hand embrace to mee, By this I beyng slayed will goe, this mouing to my brest Ile slake my woes, Her. what place shall I seeke ronnagate for rest? Where shall I hyde my selfe? or in what land my selfe engraue? What Tanais, or what Nilus els, or with his Persyan waue What Tygris violent of streame, or what fierce Rhenus flood, Or Tagus troublesome that flowes with Ibera treasures good May my ryght hand yow wash from gylt? although Mæoris cold The waues of all the Northen sea on me shed out now wolde, And al the water ther of shoulde now pas by my two handes, Yet wil the mischiefe deepe remayne alas into what landes Wilt thou O wicked man resort? to East or westerne costs? Ech where wel knowen, all place I haue of banishment quight loste From me the worlde doth flee a back, the starres that sydelyng rone Do backwarde dryue their turned course, euen Cerberus the sone With better count'naunce did behold O faythfull friend I saye, O Theseu seeke some lurking place, farre hence out of the way O thou awarder of mens gyltes what euer Iudge thou bee That hurtful men dost loue, repay a worthy thanke to me: And my desertes. I thee beseech, to ghostes of hell againe Send me that once escaped them: &amp; subiect to thy raine Restore me yet to those thy bandes, that place shal me wel hyde: And yet euen that place knowes me wel Th. Our land for thee doth bide There Mars his hande acquite agayne and made from slaughter free Restoard to armoure, loe that land (Alcides) calles for thee, Which wontes to quite the gods, and proue them Innocent to be. HERE ENDETH THE FIRST Tragedye of Seneca, called Hercules furens, translated into Englishe by Iasper Heywood studentein Oxenforde.</field>
