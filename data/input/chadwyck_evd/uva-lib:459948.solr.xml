      <field name="fulltext">PrÃ¦cipe lugubres Cantus, Melpomene. Hor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE Philip Dormer Stanhope, EARL OF CHESTERFIELD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. By William Melmoth, Esq; Spoken by Mr. Ross. 'Twas once the mode inglorious war to wage With each bold Bard that durst attempt the Stage, And Prologues were but preludes to engage. Then mourn'd the Muse, not story'd Woes alone, Condemn'd, with tears unfeign'd, to weep her own. Past are those hostile days: and Wits no more One undistinguish'd fate with Fools deplore. No more the Muse laments her long-felt wrongs, From the rude license of tumultuous tongues: In peace each Bard prefers his doubtful claim, And as he merits, meets, or misses, Fame. 'Twas thus in Greece (when Greece fair Science blest, And Heaven-born Arts their chosen Land possest) Th' assembled People sate with decent pride, Patient to hear, and skilful to decide; Less forward far to censure than to praise, Unwillingly refus'd the rival Bays. Yes; they whom Candor and true Taste inspire Blame not with half the Passion they admire; Each little Blemish with regret descry, But mark the Beauties with a raptur'd eye. Yet modest fears invade our Author's breast, With Attic lore, or Latian, all unblest; Deny'd by Fate thro' Classic fields to stray, Where bloom those wreaths, which never know decay; Where Arts from kindred Arts new force acquire, And Poets catch from Poets genial fire: Not thus he boasts the breast humane to prove, And touch those springs which generous passions move, To melt the soul by scenes of fabled woe, And bid the tear for fancy'd sorrows flow; Far humbler paths he treads in quest of Fame, And trusts to Nature what from Nature came.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A Room in Sifroy's House. Glanville, Isabella. Glanville. What means this diffidence, this idle fear? Have I not given thee proof my heart is thine? Proof that I mean to sanctify our joys By sacred wedlock? Why then doubt my truth? Why hesitate, why tremble thus to join In deeds, which justice and my love to thee Alone inspire? If we are one, our hopes, Our views, our interests ought to be the same. And canst thou tamely see this proud Sifroy Triumphant lord it o'er my baffled rights? Those late acquir'd demesnes, by partial deed Convey'd to him, in equity are mine. Isabella. The story oft I've heard: yet sure Sifroy Hath every legal title to that wealth By will bequeath'd: and childless should he die, The whole were thine. Wait then till timeâ Glanville. Art thou, My Isabella, thou an advocate For him who wrongs thy lover, and witholds Those treasures which I covet but for thee? Where is thy plighted love?âthy faith?âthy truth? Isabella. Forbear reproach! O Glanville, love to thee Hath robb'd me of my truthâbetray'd me on From step to step, till virtue quite forsook me. False if I am, 'tis to myself, not thee; Thou hast my heart, and thou shalt guide my will, Obedient to thy bidding. Glanville. Hear me thenâ This curst Sifroy stands in my fortune's way; I must remove him.âWell I know his weaknessâ His fiery temper favours my design, And aids the plot that works his own undoing. His station in the army, there secures him, As from my reach, so from my vengeance safe. But this will force him homeâI have convey'd, By Ragozin his servant, whom I sent On other business, letters which disclose His wife's amour with Paulet. Isabella. Ah! tho' me Thou hast persuaded to believe her false, Think'st thou Sifroy will credit the report? Will not remembrance of her former love, Her decent modesty, yet tender fondness, Secure his high opinion of her truth? Glanville. I know it ought not. Weak must be the man Who builds his hopes on such deceitful ground. Paulet is young, not destitute of passion; Her husband absent, they are oft together: Then she hath charms to warm the coldest breast, Melt the most rigid virtue into love, And tempt the firmest friendship to be frail. All this I've urg'd, join'd with such circumstance, Such strong presumptive proof, as cannot fail To shake the firm foundations of his trust. This once accomplish'd, his own violence And heated rage, will urge him to commit Some desperate act, and plunge him into ruin. Isabella. But grant thou should'st succeed, what will ensue? Suppose him dead, doth he not leave an heir, An infant son? He will prevent thy claimâ Glanville. That bar were easily remov'd.âBut soft, Who's here? 'Tis Ragozin return'd. [Enter Ragozin. SCENE II. Glanville, Isabella, Ragozin. Glanville. What news, Dear Ragozin? How did Sifroy receive My letters? What was their effect? O speak! My vast impatience would know all at onceâ What said he? What does he intend? Ragozin. All you could wish. A whirlwind's rage is weak To the wild storm that agitates his breast. At first indeed he doubtedâswore 'twas falseâ ImpossibleâBut as he read, his looks Grew fierce; pale horror trembled on his cheek; And with a faultering voice at length he cry'd, O she is vile!âIt must, it must be soâ Then threw him on the ground, in speechless woe. Glanville. Good, very good!âI knew 'twould gallâproceed. Ragozin. His smother'd grief at length burst forth in rage. He started from the floorâhe drew his swordâ And fixing it with violence in my graspâ Plunge this, he cry'd, O plunge it in the heart Of that vile traitor, Paulet!âYet forbearâ That exquisite revenge my own right hand Demands, nor will I give it to another! This saidâpush'd on by rage, he to her sire Dispatch'd a letter, opening to him all Her crime, and his dishonour. This to you. [Gives a letter. Glanville. How eagerly he runs into the toils, Which I have planted for his own destruction! O Ragozin, success shall double all My promises; and now we are embark'd, We must proceed, whatever storms arise. Isabella. But read the letter. [Glanville opens the letter and reads. Tho' thou hast stabb'd me to the heart, I cannot but thank thy goodness for the tender regard thou hast shown to my honour. The traitor Paulet shall die by my own hand: that righteous vengeance must be mine. Mean time, forbid the villain's entrance to my house. As to her who was once my wife, let her go to her father's, to whom I have written; leaving it to him to vindicate her virtue, or conceal her shame. I am in too much confusion to add more. SIFROY. Glanville. This is enoughâby heaven! I sought no more. It is the point at which my wishes aim'd. The death of Paulet must include his own; Justice will take that life my injuries seek, Nor shall suspicion cast one glance on me. But does he purpose soon to leave the army, Or let his vengeance sleep? Ragozin. All wild, he raves That honour should forbid to quit his charge. Yet what resolves the tumult in his breast May urge, is hard to say. Glanville. We must prepare For his arrival; well I know his rage Will burst all bounds of prudence. Thou, my friend, (For from the hour which shall compleat our business, Thy servitude shall cease) be diligent To watch all accidents, and well improve Whatever may arise. Ragozin. Trust to my care. [Exit. Glanville. O Isabella! the important hour To prove my truth, now rises to my wish. No longer shalt thou live the humble friend Of this Cleone, but her equal born, Shalt rise by me to grace an equal sphere. Isabella. Her equal born I amânor can my heart A keener pang than base dependence feel. Yet weak by nature, and in fear for thee, I tremble for th' event.âO should'st thou failâ Glanville. Dear Isabella, trust to me the proof Of her conceal'd amour. I know full well Her modesty is mere disguise, assum'd To cheat the world; but it deceives not me. I shall unveil her secret wickedness, And her dark deeds expose to open day. Isabella. Scarce can my heart give creditâ Glanville. Thou, alas, Art blinded by the semblance she displays Of truth and innocence; but I see thro' Her inmost soul, and in her secret thoughts Read wantonness. Believe me, this gay youth, Mask'd in the guise of friendship to Sifroy, Is her vile paramour. But I forget; Tell Ragozin, my love, to wait without; This business asks dispatch, and I may want His useful aid. Isabella. I go; but still my heart Beats anxious lest the truth of thy suspicions Should fail of proof. [Exit Isabella. Glanville. Fear nothing, I'm secure. Fond, easy fool! whom for my use alone, Not pleasure, I've insnar'd; thou little dream'st, That fir'd with fair Cleone's heaven of charms, I burn for their enjoyment. There, there too, Did this Sifroy, this happy hated rival, Defeat the first warm hopes that fir'd my bosom. I mark'd her beauties rising in their bloom, And purpos'd for myself the ripening sweetness; But ere I could disclose the secret flame, He stole into her heart. And O would fate But now permit my wishes to succeed, Vengeance were satisfy'd. I will attend her, And urge my suit, tho' oft repuls'd, once more. If she's obdurate still, my slighted love Converts to hatred: I will then exert The power which her deluded lord hath given, Drive her this instant hence, and in her flight, To glut my great revenge, she too shall fall. [Exit. SCENE III. Changes to another Room. Cleone and a Servant. Cleone. Paulet! my husband's friend? give him admittance; His friendship sympathizes with my love, Cheers me by talking of my absent lord, And sooths my heart with hopes of his return. [Enter Paulet. Paulet. Still do these louring clouds of sorrow shade Cleone's brow, and sadden all her hours? Cleone. Ah Paulet! have I not just cause to mourn? Three tedious years have past since these sad eyes Beheld my dear Sifroy: and the stern brow Of horrid war still frowns upon my hopes. Paulet. The fate of war, 'tis true, hath long detain'd My noble friend from your fond arms and mine: But his redoubted sword by this last stroke Must soon reduce the foe to sue for peace. The gallant chief who led the numerous host, And was himself their soul, is fallen in battle, Slain by the valiant hand of your Sifroy. Cleone. To me, alas, his courage seems no virtue: Dead to all joy but what his safety gives, To every hope, but that of his return, I dread the danger which his valour seeks, And tremble at his glory. O good Heaven! Restore him soon to these unhappy arms, Or much I fear they'll never more enfold him. Paulet. What means Cleone? No new danger can Affright you for my friend. I fear your breast Beats with the dread of some impending ill, Threatening yourself. Now, by the love that binds My heart to your Sifroy, let me intreat, If my assistance can avail you aught, That to the utmost hazard of my life You will command my service. Cleone. Kind Heaven, I thank thee! My Sifroy hath yet One faithful friend. O Pauletâbut to thee, The many virtues that adorn the mind Of my lov'd lord, and made me once so blest, 'Twere needless to display. In mine alone His happiness was plac'd; no grief, no care Came ever near my bosom; not a pain But what his tenderness partaking, sooth'd. All day with fondness would he gaze upon me, And to my listening heart repeat such things, As only love like his knew how to feel. O my Sifroy! when, when wilt thou return? Alas, thou know'st to what bold attempts Thy unsuspecting virtue has betray'd me! Paulet. What danger thus alarms Cleone's fear? Cleone. I am asham'd to think, and blush to say, That in my husband's absence this poor form, These eyes, or any feature should retain The power to pleaseâbut Glanville well you knowâ Paulet. Sure you suspect not him of base designs! He wears the semblance of much worth and honour. Cleone. So to the eye the speckled serpent wears A shining, beauteous form; but deep within, Foul stings and deadly poisons lurk unseen. O Paulet, this smooth serpent hath so crept Into the bosom of Sifroy, so wound Himself about my love's unguarded heart, That he believes him harmless as the dove. Paulet. Good Heaven, if thou abhor'st deceit, why suffer A villain's face to wear the look of virtue? Who would have thought his loose desires had flown So high a pitch! Have you imparted aught Of his attempts, to Isabella. Cleone. No. Paulet. I had suspicion his designs were there. Cleone. I've thought so too: nay have some cause to fear That she's his wife. This hath restrain'd my tongue. Paulet. I wish she may deserve your tenderness. But say, Cleone, let me know the means, Which this most impious man, this trusted friend, Hath taken to betrayâ Cleone. I hear his voice, And this way he directs his hated steps. Retire into that roomâseldom he fails To hint his bold desires. Your self perhaps May thence detect him, and by open shame Deter him from persisting. [Paulet goes into the room. Glanville enters. SCENE IV. Cleone, Glanville. Glanville. I greet you, lady, with important news; The Saracens are beatenâyet Sifroy, Coldly neglectful of your blooming charms, Pursues a remnant of the flying foe To strong Avignon's walls, where shelter'd safe, The hardy troops may bear a tedious siege. Why then, Cleone, should you still resist The soft entreaties of my warm desire? Methinks the man but ill deserves your truth, Who leaves the sweet Elysium of your arms To tread the dangerous fields of horrid war. Cleone. And what, O Glanville, what dost thou deserve? Thou, who with treachery repay'st the trust Of sacred friendship? Thou, who but to quench A loose desire, and gain a moment's pleasure, Would'st banish truth and honour from thy breast? Glanville. Honour!âWhat's honour? A vain phantom rais'd To fright the weak from tasting those delights, Which Nature's voice, that surest law, enforces. Be wise, and laugh at all its idle threats. Besides, with me your fame would be secure, Discretion guards my name from Censure's tongue. Cleone. And dost thou call hypocrisy, discretion? Say'st thou that vice is wisdom? Glanville, hear me. With thee, thou say'st, my fame would be secure; Unsully'd by the world. It might. Yet know, Tho' hid beneath the center of the earth, Remov'd from Envy's eye, and Slander's tongue, Nay from the view of Heaven itself conceal'd, Still would I shun the very thought of guilt, Nor wound my secret conscience with reproach. Glanville. Romantic all! Come, come, why is your form So exquisite, so tempting for delight; With eyes that languish, limbs that move with graceâ Why were these beauties given you, but to soothe The strong, the sweet sensations they excite? Why were you made so beauteous, yet so coy? [Offers to embrace her, she puts him by with disdain. Cleone. Base hypocrite! why rather wer't thou suffer'd Beneath fair Virtue's mien to hide a heart So vile? why this, good Heaven! But dost thou think Thy foul devices shall be still conceal'd? Sifroy shall know thee; thy detested crime At last shall be laid open to his view. Glanville. Is love a crime? O ask your feeling heartâ [Paulet bursts from the room. SCENE V. Cleone, Glanville, Paulet. Paulet. Villain, desist! Glanville. Ha! Paulet here!â'Tis well: He is her minion then! 'tis as I guess'd; My letters to Sifroy traduc'd them not. [Aside. Paulet. Vile hypocrite!âwhat, lurk such warm desires Beneath that sober mark of sanctity? Is this the firm undoubted honesty, In which Sifroy believes himself so safe? Glanville. And is it fit that thou should'st lecture vice? Thou, who ev'n here, this moment wert conceal'd, The favorite object of lewd privacy? Should'st thou declaim against the rich repast, Thy gluttonous appetite alone enjoys To all the heights of luxury?âSweet lady! Who now shall be laid open to Sifroy? But I have long, long known your intercourse, And wanted not this proof to make it clear. [Going. Cleone. O heaven and earth! Paulet. Stay, monster! By high heaven, Thy life shall answer the vile calumny. Glanville. Dream not I fear!âthy threatenings I despise. Soon I'll return, to thine and her confusion. [Exit Glanville. SCENE VI. Cleone, Paulet. Cleone. What have I done? unhappy, rash imprudence! Hath he not seeming cause for foul suspicion? Paulet. He dares not wrong you with the least surmise, The slightest imputation on your fame! Nor would the world believe him. Your fair deeds, The constant tenor of your virtuous life, Would triumph o'er th' audacious tale. Cleone. Ah Paulet! The sting of Slander strikes her venom deep. The envious world with joy devours the tale, That stains with infamy a spotless name. Yet what's the vain opinion of the world! To keep one voice, one single heart's esteem, Is all my wish. If my Sifroy but thinkâ Paulet. Wound not your peace with vain ungrounded fears: My friend is noble, knows your virtues well; Nor will he suffer jealousy to shake His generous mind with doubt. And for that wretch, This arm shall give him chastisement. Cleone. Ah! no; I fear the chastisement of Glanville's guilt May loose the tongue of Censure on my innocence. And can I bear, now, in my husband's absence, The whisper'd malice of a dubious tale On his Cleone's truth? O rather leave his punishment to Heaven! At least defer it till my lord's return. Paulet. And shall the man I love return, and find A villain unchastis'd, who in my sight Audaciously presum'd to wound his honour? Forbid it friendship! [Re-enter Glanville with Ragozin. SCENE VII. Cleone, Paulet, Glanville, Ragozin. Glanville. Sir, be pleas'd to know, 'Tis with authority that I forbid Your entrance in this house. Sifroy, convinc'd Of all your secret crimes with that vile wanton, Spurns from his door the falshood he disdains. Cleone. Let me not hear it!âI! am I a wanton? Does my dear lord think his Cleone vile? Glanville. He knows it well. Paulet. Villain, 'tis false! He scorns So mean a thought. Glanville. To silence every doubt, See his own hand. Paulet, shewing the letter to Ragozin. Say, whence is this? who brought it? Ragozin. I brought it from my master. Glanville. Look upon it. [Cleone and Paulet look over it. Cleone. Am I then banish'd from my husband's house? Branded with infamy?âwas once his wife! Unkind Sifroy! am I not still thy wife? Indeed thy faithful wife! and when thou know'st, As know thou wilt, how falsely I'm accus'd, This cruel sentence sure will pierce thy heart. Paulet. Amazement strikes me dumb!âThis impious scroll Is forg'd. Sifroy, tho' rash, is noble, just, And good. Too good, too noble to permit So mean a thought to harbour in his breast. Cleone. No: 'tis his handâhis seal. And can I bear Suspicion! O Sifroy, didst thou not know My heart incapableâ Paulet. Audacious wretch! At what fell mischief has thy malice aim'd? Glanville. At thine and her detection: which at length I have accomplish'd. Paulet. Impudent and vain! Think'st thou Cleone's virtue, her fair truth, Can suffer taint from thy unhallow'd breath? Were they not proof but now against thy arts? Glanville. Mistaken man! To gain one personal proof Of her incontinence, that feign'd attempt Was made; all other proof I had before, And why I fail'd thou know'st; Who in her private chamber close conceal'd, Mad'st it imprudent she should then comply. Cleone. Detested slanderer! I despise thy baseness; Disdain reply; and trust in Heaven's high hand To dash thy bold designs. [Exit Cleone. Paulet, whispering. Observe me, Sirâ This insult on the honour of my friend Must be chastis'd. At morning's earliest dawn, In the close vale, behind the castle's wall, Prepare to meet me arm'd. Glanville. Be well assur'd I will not fail. [Exit Paulet. Yet stayâlet Prudence guide meâ Courage, what is't?â'tis folly's boisterous rashness, And draws its owner into hourly dangers. I hold it safer he were met to-night. [Aside. Thou see'st, my Ragozin, we are embark'd Upon a troubled sea: our safeties now Depend on boldly steming every wave, That might o'erwhelm our hopes. Paulet must dieâ He's dangerous, and not only may defeat Our enterprize, but bring our lives in hazard. Ragozin. Shall we not frustrate thus your first design, To make the law subservient to your aims Against the life and fortunes of Sifroy? Glanville. Leave that to me. Sifroy, full well I know, Will soon arrive. Thou, when the gloom of night Shall cast a veil upon the deeds of men, Trace Paulet's steps, and in his bosom plunge Thy dagger's point: thus shall thy care prevent His future babbling; and to prove the deed Upon Sifroy, be mine. Ragozin. He dies this night. Glanville. Let thy first blow make sure his death, So shall no noise detect thee. Hither strait Convey his corpse, which secretly inter'd Within the garden's bound, prevents discovery, Till I shall spring the mine of their destruction. Ragozin. He shall not live an hour. [Exit Ragozin. Glanville. Hence, hence Remorse! I must not, will not feel thy scorpion sting. Yet hell is in my breast, and all its fiends Distract my resolutions.âI am plung'd In blood, and must wade thro': no safety now But on the farther shore. Come then, Revenge, Ambition come, and disappointed Love; Be you my dread companions: steel, O steel My heart with triple firmness, nerve my arm With tenfold strength, and guide it to atchieve The deeds of Terror which your selves inspir'd.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. A Room in Sifroy's House. Glanville, Isabella. Glanville. Sure the dark hand of death ere this hath clos'd The prying eyes of Paulet, and secur'd Our bold attempt from danger. But hast thou, Free from suspicion, to Cleone's hand Convey'd the letter, forg'd against my self, Pressing her instant flight, and branding me With black designs against her life? Isabella. I have; Pretending 'twas receiv'd from hands unknown. But lurks no danger here? Will not this letter, Discover'd after death, betray thy scheme? Glanville. 'Gainst that too I'm secure. The deed once done, A deep enormous cavern in the wood Receives her body, and for ever hides. But she perus'd, thou say'st, the letterâwellâ How wrought it?âsayâthis moment will she fly? Success in this, and all shall be our own. Isabella. Silent she paus'dâand read it o'er and o'er. Then lifting up her eyesâforgive him, Heaven! Was all she said. But soon her rising fear Resolv'd on quick escape. Suspicion too, That all her servants are by thee corrupted, Urges to fly alone, save with her child, The young Sifroy, whom clasping to her breast, And bathing with a flood of tears, she means, Safe from thy snares, to shelter with her father. Glanville. Just as I hop'dâBeneath the friendly gloom Of Baden wood, whose unfrequented paths They needs must pass to reach her father's house, I have contriv'd, and now ordain their fall. Kindly she plans her scheme, as tho' her self Were my accomplice. Isabella. As we parted, tears Gush'd from her eyesâshe closely press'd my hand, And hesitating cry'dâO Isabella! If 'tis not now too late, beware of Glanville. I scarce could hold from weeping. Glanville. Fool! root out That weakness, which unfits th' aspiring soul For great designs. But hush! who's here? [Enter Ragozin. SCENE II. Glanville, Isabella, Ragozin. Glanville. Say, quicklyâ Is our first work atchiev'd? Ragozin. Successfully. With two bold ruffians, whose assisting hands Were hir'd to make the business sure, I trac'd His steps with care; and in the darksome path Which leads beside the ruin'd abby's wall, With furious onset suddenly attack'd him. Instant he drew, and in my arm oblique Fix'd a slight wound; but my associates soon Perform'd their office; and betwixt them borne, I left him to an hasty burial, where You first directed. Glanville. We are then secure From his detection; and may now advance With greater safety. O my Ragozin, But one step more remains, to plant our feet On this Sifroy's possessions; and methinks, Kind Opportunity now points the path Which leads us to our wish. Ragozin. Propose the means. Glanville. This hour Cleone with her infant boy, Borrowing faint courage from the moon's pale beam, Prepares to seek the mansion of her father. Thou know'st the neighbouring wood thro' which they pass. Ragozin. I know each path, and every brake. Glanville. There hid In secret ambush, thou must intercept Her journey. Ragozin. And direct her to the world Unknown. Glanville. Thou read'st my meaning right. Go thou To hasten her departure, and to keep [To Isabella. Her fears awake. Isabella. Already she believes Her life depends upon her instant flight. [Exit Isabella. SCENE III. Glanville, Ragozin. Glanville. And haply ours. Each moment that she lives Grows dangerous now: and should she reach her father, All may be lost. Let therefore no delay Hang on thy steps: Terror must wing her flight, And danger calls on us for equal speed. Ragozin. They 'scape me not. I know the private path Which they must tread thro' Baden's lonesome wood, And Death shall meet them in the dreary gloom. Glanville. Mean time, soon as she leaves her house, I raise, From whispering tongues, a probable report, That she with Paulet seeks some foreign shore. This will confirm her guilt, and shelter us From all suspicion. Ragozin. True; both gone at once, Will give an air of truth so plausibleâ Glanville. Hark! hush! Ragozin. Who is it? Glanville. 'Tis Cleone's voice! This way she comesâwe must not now be seen. Fly to thy post, and think on thy reward. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Cleone with her Child. No Paulet to be found! Misfortune sure Prevents his friendship: and I dare not wait For his assistance. Friendless and alone I wander forth, Heaven my sole guide, and truth My sole support. But come, my little love, Thou wilt not leave me. Child. No, indeed I won't! I'll love you, and go with you every where, If you will let me. Cleone. My sweet innocent! Thou shalt go with me. I've no comfort left But thee. I hadâI had a husband once, And thou a fatherâbut we're now cast out From his protection, banish'd from his love. Child. Why won't he love us? Sure I've heard you say You lov'd him dearly. Cleone. O my bursting heart! His innocence will kill me. So I do, My angel, and I hope you'll love him too. Child. Yes, so I will, if he'll love you: and can't I make him love you? Cleone. Yes, my dear; for how Could he withstand that sweet pursuasive look Of infant innocence! Child. O then he shall, If ever I do see him, he shall love you. Cleone. My best, my only friend! and wilt thou plead Thy poor wrong'd mother's cause? [Enter Isabella. SCENE V. Cleone, her Child, and Isabella. Isabella. Dear madam, haste! Why thus delay your flight, When dangers rise around? Cleone. Indeed, my steps Will linger, Isabella.âO 'tis hardâ Alas, thou can'st not feel how hard it isâ To leave a husband's house so dearly lov'd! Yet go I mustâmy life is here unsafe. Pardon, good Heaven, the guilt of those who seek it! I fear not death: yet fain methinks would live To clear my truth to my unkind Sifroy. Isabella. O doubt not, madam, he will find the truth, And banish from his breast this strange suspicion. But haste, dear lady, wing your steps with haste, Lest Death should interceptâ Cleone. And must I go? Adieu, dear mansion of my happiest years! Adieu, sweet shades! each well-known bower, adieu! Where I have hung whole days upon his words, And never thought the tender moments longâ All, all my hopes of future peace, farewel! [Throws herself on her knees. But, O great Power! who bending from thy throne, Look'st down with pitying eyes on erring man, Whom weakness blinds, and passions lead astray, Impute not to Sifroy this cruel wrong! O heal his bosom, wounded by the darts Of lying Slander, and restore to him That peace, which I must never more regain. [Rises. Come, my dear love, Heaven will, I trust, protect And guide our wandering steps! Yet stayâwho knows, Perhaps my father too, if Slander's voice Hath reach'd his ear, may chide me from his door, Or spurn me from his feet!âMy sickening heart Dies in me at that thought! Yet surely he Will hear me speak! A parent sure, will not Give up his child unheard! Isabella. He surely will not. Whence these groundless fears? Cleone. Indeed I am to blame, to doubt his goodness. Farewel, my friend!âAnd oh, when thou shalt see My still-belov'd Sifroy; say, I forgive himâ Say I but live to clear my truth to him; Then hope to lay my sorrows in the grave, And that my wrongs, lest they should wound his peace, May be forgotten. [Exit Cleone, with her child. SCENE VI. Isabella, alone. Gracious Heaven! her grief Strikes thro' my heart! Her truth, her innocence Are surely wrong'd.âO wherefore did I yield My virtue to this man! Unhappy hour! But 'tis too late!âNor dare I now relent. [Enter Glanville. SCENE VII. Isabella, Glanville. Glanville. The gate is clos'd against her, never more (If right I read her doom) to give her entrance. Thus far, my Isabella, our designs Glide smoothly on. The hand of Prudence is To me the hand of Providence. Isabella. Alas! How weak, how blind is human prudence found! I wish, and hope indeed, that screen'd beneath The shades of night, which hide these darker deeds, We too may lie conceal'd: but ah, my hopes Are dash'd with fear, lest day's broad eye at length Flash on our secret guilt, and bring detection. Glanville, sternly. If thy vain fears betray us not, we're safe. Observe me well.âHad I the least surmise, That struck by conscience, or by phantoms awed, Thou now would'st shrinkâand leave me, or betrayâ By all the terrors that would shake my soul To perpetrate the deed, thou too should'st fall! Isabella. And can'st thou then suspect, that after all I've done to prove my love, I should betray thee? O Glanville! thou art yet it seems to learn, That in her fears tho' weak, a woman's love Inspires her breast with strength above her sex. Glanville. Forgive me, Isabella, I suspect Thee not; but this hot fever burning in My brain, distracts my reason. Yes, I know Thee faithful, and will hence be calm. Isabella. Indeed my heart so wholly has been thine, That thou hast form'd its temper to thy wish. Glanville. Think on my warmth no more. I was to blame. But come, my love, our chief, our earliest care Must be to give loud Rumour instant voice, That both detected in their loose amour Are fled together. Whisper thou the tale First to the servants, in whose listening ears Suspicions are already sown; while I Th' unwelcome tydings to her sire convey. [Exit Isabella one way, and as Glanville is going out the other, he meets a servant. Servant. My lady's brother, sir, young Beaufort, just Arriv'd, enquires for you, or for his sister. Glanville. Attend him in.âThe letters of Sifroy Have reach'd their hands. My story of her flight Will, like a closing witness well prepar'd, Confirm her guilt. [Enter Beaufort Junior. SCENE VIII. Glanville, Beaufort Junior. Beaufort Junior. What strange suspicion, Glanville, has possess'd The bosom of Sifroy? Whence had it birth? Or on what ground could Malice fix her stand, To throw the darts of Slander on a name So guarded as Cleone's? Glanville. I could wishâ It gives me pain to speakâbut I could wish The conduct of Cleone had not given So fair a mark. Beaufort Junior. So fair a mark!âWhat! who? Cleone, say'st thou!âHath my sister given So fair a mark to Slander? have a care! The breath that blasts her fame may raise a storm Not easily appeas'd. Glanville. It grieves me, sir, That you compel me to disclose, what you In bitterness of soul must hear. But she And Prudence have of late been much estrang'd. Beaufort Junior. Defame her notâDiscretion crowns her brow, And in her modest eye, sweet Innocence Smiles on Detraction. Where, where is my sister? She shall confront thy wordsâher look alone Shall prove thy tale a groundless calumny. Glanville. You surely know not, sir, that she is fledâ Beaufort Junior. What say'st thou?âFled!âSurprize choaks up my words! It cannot be!âFled! whither?âGone! with whom? Glanville. With Paulet, sir, Sifroy's young friend. Beaufort Junior. Impossible! I'm on the rack! Tell, I conjure thee, tell The truthâWhere are they gone? Glanville. That they conceal. I only know, that finding their intrigue Detected, they abscond: and 'tis suppos'd Will seek for shelter on some foreign shore. Beaufort Junior. Where then is Truth, and where is Virtue fled, Ere while her dear companions?âO my sister! How art thou fallen?âThy father tooâO parricide! Had'st thou no pity on his bending age? On his fond heartâtoo feeble now to bear So rude a shock? Glanville. Can it not be conceal'd? Beaufort Junior. O no!âHe comes, impatient to enquire From his lov'd daughter, whence Sifroy had cause For his opprobrious charge.âAnd see, he's here. [Enter Beaufort Senior. SCENE IX. Beaufort Senior, Beaufort Junior, Glanville. Beaufort Senior. Where is my daughter? where my injur'd child? O bring me to her! she hath yet a father, (Thanks to the gracious Powers who spar'd my life For her protection) ready to receive With tender arms his child, tho' rudely cast From her rash husband's door. What mean these tears That trickle down thy cheek? she is not dead! Beaufort Junior. Good Heaven! what shall I say?âno, sirânot deadâ She is not deadâbut Oh!â Beaufort Senior. But what?âWound not My heart! where is she? lead me to my childâ 'Tis from her self alone that I will hear The story of her wrongs. Beaufort Junior. Alas! dear sir, She is not here. Beaufort Senior. Not here! Beaufort Junior. O fortify Your heart, my dearest father, to support, If possible, this unexpected stroke! My sister, sirâwhy must I speak her shame! My wretched sister, yielding to the lure Of Paulet's arts, hath left her husband's house. Beaufort Senior. Great Power! then have I liv'd, alas! too long. O patience! this, this is indeed too much!â But 'tis impossible!âdoes not thy heart, My son, bear testimony for thy sister Against this calumny?âWhat circumstance, [To Glanville. What proof have we of my Cleone's guilt? Glanville. Is not their disappearing both at once, A strong presumption of their mutual guilt? Beaufort Senior. Presumption, say'st thou! shall one doubtful fact Arraign a life of innocence unblam'd? Shall I give up the virtue of my child, My heart's sweet peace, the comfort of my age, On weak surmises?âSir, I must have proof, Clear proof, not dark presumption of her guilt. Glanville. Thus rudely urg'd, my honour bids me speak, What else I meant in tenderness to spare. Know then, I found the wanton youth conceal'd In her apartment. Beaufort Senior. Thou dost then confess Thy self my child's accuser?âbut thy word Will not suffice. Far other evidence Must force me to believe, that truth long known, And native modesty, could thus at once Desert their station in Cleone's breast. Glanville. Wait then for other evidenceâ With such as doubt my honour, I disdain All farther conference. [Exit Glanville. SCENE X. Beaufort Senior, Beaufort Junior. Beaufort Junior. What can we think? His firm undaunted boldness fills my breast With fearful doubts, that dread to be resolv'd. Yet this suspence is Torture's keenest pain. Beaufort Senior. We must not bear it. No, my son, lead on; We must be satisfy'd. Let us direct Our steps to Paulet's habitation. There, It seems we must enquire. And yet my soul Strongly impels me to suspect this Glanville. For can Cleone, can the darling child Of Virtue be so chang'd?âIf thou art fallenâ If thy weak steps, by this bad world seduc'd, Have devious turn'd into the paths of shame, O let me never, never live to hear Thy foul dishonour mention'd.âIf thou art Traduc'dâand my fond heart still flatters me With hopeâthen, gracious Heaven! spare yet my life, O spare a father to redress his child! End of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Area before Sifroy's House. Sifroy alone. O dreadful change! my house, my sacred home, At sight of which my heart was wont to bound With rapture, I now tremble to approach. Fair mansion, where bright Honour long hath dwelt With my renown'd progenitors, how, how At last hath vile Pollution stain'd thy walls! Yet look not down with scorn, ye shades rever'd, On your dishonour'd sonâHe will not die Till just revenge hath by the wanton's blood Atton'd for this disgrace.âYet can it be? Can my Cleone, she whose tender smile Fed my fond heart with hourly rapture, she On whose fair faith alone I built all hope Of happinessâcan she have kill'd my peace, My honour? Could that angel form, which seem'd The shrine of Purity and Truth, become The seat of Wantonness and Perfidy? Ye Powers!âshould she be wrong'dâin my own heart How sharp a dagger hath my frenzy plung'd! O passion-govern'd slave! what hast thou done? Hath not thy madness from her house, unheard, Driven out thy bosom friend?âGuiltless perhapsâ Hell, hell is in that thought!âO wretch accurst! Such thy rash fury, thy unbridled rage, Her guilt or innocence alike to thee Must bring distraction. But I'll know the worst. [Exit. SCENE II. Changes to a Room in the House. Glanville, Isabella. Glanville. What dost thou say? Already is Sifroy Arriv'd? Who saw him? When? Isabella. This moment, from My window, by the glimmering of the moon, I saw him pass. Glanville. He comes as I could wish. His hot-brain'd fury well did I foresee Would, on the wings of vengeance, swiftly urge His homeward flight. But I am ready arm'd, Rash fool! for thy destruction. And tho' long Thou hast usurp'd my rights, thy death at last Shall give me ample justice. Isabella. Ah, beware; Nor seek his life with peril of thine own. Glanville. Trust me, my love, (tho' time too precious now Will not permit t'unfold to thee my scheme) I walk in safety, yet have in my grasp Secure, his hated life.âBut see, he comesâ Retire. [Exit Isabella. Enter Sifroy. SCENE III. Glanville, Sifroy. Glanville, advancing to embrace him. My honoured friend!â Sifroy. Glanville, forbearâ And e'er I join my arms with thee in friendship, Say, I conjure thee by that sacred tye, By all thou hold'st most dear on earth, by all Thy hopes of heaven, and dread of deepest hellâ Hast thou not wrong'd my wife? Glanville. Unjust Sifroy! Hath my true friendship so regardful been, So jealous of thy honour, and dost thou Suspect my own? Surely the double bonds Of friendship and of blood, are ties too strong To leave a doubt of my sincerity. And soon too clearly, sir, you will discern Who has been false, and who your faithful friend. Sifroy. O rack me not!âlet dread conviction comeâ Her strongest horrors cannot rend my heart With half the anguish of this torturing doubt. Speak thenâfor tho' the tale should fire my brain To madness, I must hear it. Yet, Glanville, stayâ Let me proceed with cautionâmy soul's peace Depends upon this moment.âWhere's my wife? Severe I may be, but I will be just. I cannot, will not hear her faith arraign'd, Before I see her. Glanville. See her, sir! alas, Where will you see her? Sifroy. Where! thou hast not yet Convey'd her to her father?âOn the wings Of speed I flew, still hoping to prevent The rash decree of unreflecting rage. Glanville. Heaven give thee patience!âO Sifroy! my heart, Tho' thou hast wrong'd it with unkind suspicion, Bleeds for thy injuries, for thy distress. The wife, whom thou so tenderly hast lov'd, Is fled with Paulet. Sifroy. Fled!âhow? whither? when? Glanville. This day they disappear'd, and 'tis believ'd Intend to fly from shame, and leave the land. Sifroy. Impossible!âshe cannot be so chang'dâ Was she not all perfection?âO take heedâ Once more I charge thee, Glanville, and my soul's Eternal welfare rests upon thy truthâ Traduce her not! nor drive me to perdition! For by the flames of vengeance, if I find Thy accusation true, they shall not 'scape! O I will trace th' adulterer's private haunts, Rush like his evil genius on their shame, And stab the traytor in her faithless armsâ Almighty Power! from whose broad eye lies hid No secret crime! O take not from my arm This due revengeânor tempt mankind to doubt The justice of thy ways. Why this intrusion? [Enter a Servant. Servant. My lady's father, Sir. Sifroy. Her father here! Glanville. Yes, he was here beforeâthy letters brought himâ And hence went forth in rage to find out Paulet. Sifroy. Conduct him in. [Exit Servant. Unhappy man! his grief, His venerable tears will wring my heart. Retire, good Glanville; interviews like these, Of deep-felt mutual woe, all witness shun. [Exit Glanville. SCENE IV. Sifroy, Beaufort Senior. Beaufort Senior. Rash man! what hast thou done? upon what ground Dost thou impeach the honour of my name, In treating thus my child? O thou hast from Thy bosom cast away the sweetest flower That ever Nature form'd. Sifroy. Reproach me notâ Commiserate a wretch, on whom severe Affliction lays her iron hand!âO sir, That flower which look'd so beauteous to the sense, Turn'd wild, grew ranker than a common weed. Beaufort Senior. It is notâcannot be! Have I not known, Even from her earliest childhood known her heart? Known it the seat of tenderness and truth? Her thoughts were ever pure as virgin snows From heaven descending: and that modest blush Display'd on her fair cheek, was Virtue's guard. She could not fall thus lowâmy child is wrong'd! Let me to thine own heart, my son, appeal: Was she not all a parent's fondest wishâ Sifroy. Call not to my distracted mind how fair, How good she once appear'd.âTime was indeed, When blest in her chaste love, I fondly thought My heart possess'd of all that earth held fair And amiable: but memory of past bliss Augments the bitter pang of present woe! Is she not chang'dâfallenâlost? Beaufort Senior. Patience, my son! And calm the tempest of thy grief. Just Heaven Will doubtless soon reveal the hidden deeds Of guilt and shame. If thy unhappy wife Thus wanton in the paths of Vice hath stray'dâ I would not rashly curse my darling childâ Yet hear me, righteous Heaven! May infamy, Disease, and beggary imbitter all Her wretched life! But my undoubting heart, In full conviction of her spotless truth, Acquits her of all crime. Sifroy. Is it no crime, That listening to a vile seducer's voice, She leaves her husband's houseâher dearest friends? Flies with her paramour to foreign climes, A willing exile? Beaufort Senior. Art thou well inform'd They went together? How doth it appear? Who saw them? Where? Alas! thy headlong rage Was too impatient to permit enquiry. Sifroy. Were they not missing both? both at one hour? Say, for thou hast enquir'd; is Paulet sound? Beaufort Senior. He is not: but my son perhaps, whom zeal To clear a much-lov'd sister's injur'd fame Spurs on to make the strictest inquisition, May bring some tydings. Sifroy. May kind Heaven direct His steps where dark concealment hides their shame From day, and from my just revenge. Beaufort Senior. Still, still Thy rage with groundless inference concludes Their un-prov'd guilt. Be calm, and answer me. Think'st thou thy wife, if bent on loose designs, Would madly join an infant in her flight, T' impede her steps, and aggravate her shame? Sifroy. O my confusion! where, where is my child? Alas, I had forgot the harmless innocent! Bring to my arms the poor deserted babe! He knows no crime, and guiltless of offence, Shall put his little hands into my breast, And ease a father's bosom of its sorrows. Beaufort Senior. Unhappy man! that comfort is deny'd thee. Sifroy. What mean'st thou?âSpeakâYet ah, take heed! My heart already is too deeply pierc'd, To bear another woundâWhat of my child? Beaufort Sen. That he's the partner of his mother's flight, Should calm, not raise the tempest of thy griefâ As hence one would infer, that injury, Not guilt, hath driven my daughter from thy house. Who's her accuser? Sifroy. One Whose honour, justice, and religious truth Have oft been try'd, and ever faithful found. He, sir, whose friendship, with reluctant grief. At length disclosed my shame, was honest Glanville: Report from vulgar breath I had despis'd. Beaufort Sen. So may high Heaven deal mercy to my child, As I believe him treacherous and base. [Enter Beaufort Jun. SCENE V. Sifroy, Beaufort Sen. Beaufort Jun. Beaufort Sen. Here comes my sonâWhat means this look of terror? Beaufort Jun. I fear, my father, some dread mischiefâHa!â Is he return'd?âNow may the Powers avert This dire suspicion that strikes thro' my heart! Tell, I conjure thee tell meâwhere's my sister? Thou hast not murder'd her! Sifroy. Good Heaven! what means My brother's dreadful words? Murder my wife! O quickly speak!âMy heart shrinks up with horror! Whence are thy apprehensions? Beaufort Sen. My dear son, Keep not thy father on the rack of doubt, But speak thy fears. Beaufort Jun. What fate may have befallen My injur'd sister, Heaven and thou best knowâ But Paulet, whom thy fierce revenge pursu'd, This night is murder'd. Sifroy. Ha! what say'st thou?âPaulet! Is Paulet dead? How know'st thou he is murder'd? Beaufort Jun. In the dark path which to the cloyster leads, His sword is found, and bloody marks appear, That speak the deed too plain. Sifroy. But where's my wife? Was not she with him? Went they not together? Beaufort Jun. Together! no. The villain Glanville's false! My sister is traduc'd! Sifroy. Tremendous Power! What tempest wrapt in darkness now prepares To burst on my devoted head? What crime Unknown, or unrepented, points me out, The mark distinguish'd of peculiar vengeance? Why turns the gracious all-protecting eye Averse from me? O guide my steps, to find Where lurks this hidden mischiefâ Beaufort Jun. Lurks it not In thine own breast? Beaufort Sen. My son, forbear. Sifroy. Art thou My brother?âO unkind! Would I have stabb'd Thy heart when breaking with convulsive pangs Of doubt and terror?âBut I'm paid in kindâ Was not I cruel? Where, where is my wife? Convey me to her armsâshe's wrong'd, she's wrong'd! Yet like offended Heaven she will forgive. My friend too, my best friend is murder'd! Oh, What handaccurs'd hath wrought this dreadful deed? Support me, mercy! 'tis too much, too much! But let Distraction come, and from my brain Tear out the seat of Memory, that I No more may think, no more may be a wretch! Beaufort Sen. Patience, my son. When Heaven's high hand afflicts, Submission best becomes usânor let man, The child of weakness, murmur. Sifroy. O my father! Thee too my rashness hath undone! Thou, thou Wilt join with Heaven to curse me! But I kiss The rod of chastisement, and in the dust Resign'd, a prostrate suppliant, beg for mercy. Beaufort Sen. Moderate the grief, Which thus unmans theeâRouse thee to the search Of these dark deedsâand Heaven direct our footsteps! Hath not Suspicion whisper'd to thy heart, That he, this Glanville, whom thy friendship trusts, With confidence intire, may yet be false? Sifroy. Till this dread hour, suspicion of his truth Ne'er touch'd my breastâNow, doubt and horror raise Distraction in my soul. Beaufort Sen. O gracious Power! Look on our sorrows with a pitying eye! My feeble heart sinks in meâBut do thou Bear up against this tide of woe: I trust, If goodness dwells in heaven, my child is safe. Perhaps she seeks the shelter of these arms, And we have miss'd her in th' entangled wood. With speed dispatch immediate messengers Thro' different paths, with strictest search to trace Cleone's steps, or find thy murder'd friend. My son I charge thee see this well perform'd. Beaufort Jun. I will not fail. [Exit Beaufort Jun. Beaufort Sen. Mean while let us observe Each motion, word, and look of this fell fiend, Whose horrid schemes, tho' gloss'd with saintlike shew, (If much I err not) soon shall be disclos'd. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Changes to the Wood. Enter Cleone, and the Child. Cleone. Whence do these terrors seize my sinking heart? Since guilt I know not, why submit to fear? And yet these silent shadowy scenes awake Strange apprehensions. Gracious Heaven, protect My weakness!âHark! what noise is that?âall still. It was but fancy.âYet methought the howl Of distant wolves broke on the ear of Night, Doubling the desart's horror. Child. O I'm frighted! Why do you speak, and look so strangely at me? Cleone. I will not fright my love. Come, let's go onâ We've but a little way.âSave us ye Powers! [Sees Ragozin enter with a dagger and a mask on. She flies with her child, he follows. Ragozin. Stopâfor thou fly'st in vain. Cleone (within the scenes) Help! mercy! Save, O save my child! O murder! O my child! [She retreats back to the scene, and falls in a swoon. [Re-enter Ragozin. Ragozin. She too is dead!âI fear'd that blow was shortâ But hark! what noise!âI must not be detectedâ [Exit. Cleone, waking from her trance. Where have I been? What horrid hand hath stamp'd This dreadful vision on my brain? O Death! Have I not past thy terrors? Am I still In this bad world? What ails my heart? my head? Was not my child here with me? Sure he wasâ And some foul fiend suggests to my sad heart That he is murder'd! Gracious Heaven, forbid! Conduct my steps, kind Providence, to where My little wanderer strays, that I may know This horror in my mind is but a dream. [Goes out. SCENE VIII. Changes to an adjoining part of the wood, and discovers the child murder'd. [Cleone re-enters. Cleone. Tremendous Silence! Not a sound returns, Save the wild echoes of my own sad cries, To my affrighted ear!âMy child! my child! Where art thou stray'd? O where, beyond the reach Of thy poor mother's voice?âYet while in Heaven The God of justice dwells, I will not deem The bloody vision true. Heaven hath not left meâ There my truth is known, well knownâAnd, see my love! See, where upon the bank, its weary'd limbs Lie stretch'd in sleep. In sleep!âO agony! Blast not my senses with a sight like this! 'Tis blood! 'tis death! my child, my child is murder'd! [Falls down by her child, kissing it and weeping. Then raising herself on her arm, after a dead silence, and looking by degrees more and more wild, she proceeds in a distracted manner. Hark! hark! lie still, my love!âO for the world Don't stir!â'Tis Glanville, and he'll murder us! Stay, stayâI'll cover thee with boughsâdon't fearâ I'll call the little lambs, and they shall bring Their softest fleece to shelter thee from cold. There, thereâlie closeâhe shall not seeâno, no; I'll tell him 'tis an angel I have hid. [She rises up. Where is he? soft!âhe's gone, he's gone, my love, And shall not murder thee.âPoor innocent! 'Tis fast asleep.âO well thought! I'll go, Now while he slumbersâpick wild berries for himâ And bring a little water in my handâ Then, when he wakes, we'll seat us on the bank, And sing all night. End of the Third ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE, a Room in Sifroy's House. Glanville, Isabella. Glanville. Betray'd! by whom betray'd? By thy vain fear. How curst is he who treads on Danger's path, Entangled with a woman! Fool! alone I had been safe. Isabella. Yet hear meâOn my life, No word from me hath 'scap'd. We may perchance Be yet secure. Glanville. Perchance! And do our lives Depend on fickle chance? But speakâproceedâ Whence are thy fears? Isabella. In close concealment hid, This moment I o'erheard a whisper'd scheme Of seizing theeâ Glanville. Confusion! Can it be? Can Ragozin, the villain, have betray'd me? Isabella. I fear he hath. Where is he? Glanville. Not return'd From Baden wood, to ascertain the deed That crowns our business. Were but that secure, My tortur'd soul, torn on the rack of doubt, Might yet feel peace. How wears the time? Isabella. Two hours Are wanting yet to midnight. Glanville. Where's Sifroy? Isabella. With Beaufort. But perplexing doubts distract His reason, that all power to act forsakes him. Still farther to alarmâdeep stain'd with gore, The sword of Paulet's found, and other marks That speak him murder'd Glanville. That's beyond my wish: And tells but what I wanted to proclaim. Isabella. Proclaim! What mean'st thou? Doth it not conduce To our detection? Doth it not confirm Their dark suspicions? Glanville. The short line, alas, Of thy weak thought, in vain would sound the depth Of my designs. But rest thee well assur'd I have foreseen, and am prepar'd to meet All possible events. Isabella. O grant, good Heaven,â Great God! how dreadful 'tis to be engag'd In what we dare not pray that Heaven may prosper! Glanville. Curse on thy boding tongue! Let me not hear Its superstitious weaknessâHush! who comes? No moreâ'tis RagozinâNow sleep distrustâ First let me learn if he hath done the deedâ If not, I am betray'dâand will awake In vengeance on his falseshood. [Enter Ragozin. SCENE II. Glanville, Isabella, Ragozin. Glanville. Speak, my friendâ Cleone and her childâsay quicklyâhow dispos'd? Ragozin. To Heaven remov'd, no longer they obstruct Our views on earth. Glanville. Speak plainlyâare they dead? Ragozin. Both dead. Glanville. Swear, swear to this!âAnd by all hope Of that reward which urg'd thee to the deed, Swear thou hast not betray'd me! Ragozin. Whence arise These base suspicions? I disdain that crime Tho' branded with the name of an assassin, I am not yet so mean as to betray. Glanville. Distraction!âMay I trust thee? Ragozin. As thou wilt. Glanville, pausing. It must be soâwe still are safe: and this Pretence of strong suspicion, is no more Than subtil artifice, contriv'd to draw Th' unwary to confession. Ragozin. 'Tis no more. Glanville. Nor will I more than with a just contempt Regard it. All our deeds of blood are done. What now remains, the law shall execute. Ragozin. What's to be done? Glanville. The thrust thus aim'd at me, Shall deeply pierce Sifroy's unguarded bosom. Thy aid once moreâas witness to his threatsâ Ragozin. Freely I wouldâBut safety now requires That I abscond. The stipulated sum, Forgive me therefore, if I claim this night. Glanville. 'Tis thine. But hark!âretireâI hear his stepâ One moment wait, and all shall be adjusted. Ragozin (aside.) Curs'd chance! Were I possess'd of my reward, Who would might wait thee nowânor will I more Than some short moments rest unsatisfied. [Exit. [Enter Sifroy. SCENE III. Glanville, Sifroy. Sifroy, not seeing Glanville. O Happiness! thou frail, thou fading flower, Whose culture mocks all human toil, farewel! But I, blind madman! by the roots have pluck'd Thy sweetness from my bosom. My dear love! Where wanders now thy wrong'd, thy helpless virtue? On what cold stone reclines thy drooping head, While trickling tears call thy Sifroy inhuman. Deluded wretch! why did my greedy ear Catch the rank poison of Suspicion's breath, And to my tortur'd brain convey distraction? Glanville, advancing to him. Are thus my faithful services repaid? Are the plain truths my undisguising heart In friendship told, already deem'd no more Than vile suggestions of designing falshood? Sifroy. Villain, they are!âThou know'st them false as hell! Where is my wife?âO traytor! thou hast plung'd My soul into perdition! Glanville. Rather say, That he who led astray the willing wife, Thy folly doats onâheâ Sifroy. Blasphemer! stop Thy impious tongue! The breast of that dear saint Enshrines a soul as spotless as her form. Said'st thou not, Slanderer! that my love was fled With Paulet? Glanville. True: I did. Sifroy. Art thou not sure That this is false? Hast thou no dreadful cause To know it cannot be. Glanville. None. Thou, perhaps, Whose bloody errand I indeed have heard Already is accomplish'dâThou, 'tis true, May'st know that they are parted: 'twas the deed Thou cam'st thus swiftly to perform. But how Doth that impeach the truth of her elopement? That thou hast murder'd him, acquits not her. Sifroy. That I have murder'd!âI!âPernicious wretch! What dark designs, by blackest fiends inspir'd, Lurks in thy treacherous soul? Tremendous Power! Have I then sinn'd beyond all hope of mercy? Must the deep phial of thy vengeance, pour'd On my devoted head, flow from his hand? But all thy ways are just! To him I gave That credit which I ow'd my injur'd loveâ He now, by thy supreme decree, stands forth Th' avenger of my crime. [Enter Beaufort Senior, with officers, &amp;c. SCENE VI. Sifroy, Glanville, Beaufort Sen. Officers, &amp;c. Beaufort Senior. Seize there your victim. Glanville. What means this outrage?âUpon what pretenceâ Beaufort Senior. The bloody hand of Murder points out thee To strong Suspicion. Turn'st thou pale?âO wretch! Thy guilt drinks up thy blood. Glanville. Not guilt, but rage! Who dares accuse me? Beaufort Senior. I. Where's Paulet? where My daughter? who, thou basely said'st, were fled Together? Glanville. If his poniard found the way To part them, that impeaches not my truth. Beaufort Senior. His poniard! Glanville. His. I should have scorn'd t'accuse The man, whose honour I think deeply wrong'd: But mine own life attempted thus, demands That truth should rise to light. Cam'st thou not here, Driven by the fury of a dire revenge? What motive else urg'd thy impetuous haste? Sifroy. Insidious slave! hast thou insnar'd my soul By treacherous arts?âHast thou with falshoods vile Inflam'd this hapless breast?âAnd would'st thou now Infer my guilt, from my provok'd resentment? Glanville. Lean'd I on feeble inferenceâI would ask, What cause have I to seek this Paulet's blood? 'Twas not my wife, my daughter, he seduc'd! How has he injur'd me? But I reject These trivial pleasâI build on certain proof. Beaufort Senior. What proof? Glanville. The strongestâhis own hand and seal Fixt to the firm resolve, that he alone [Shewing the letter. Would do the righteous deedâfor so his rage Calls Paulet's murder. Beaufort Senior. Ha! What can I think! Unhappy man! and hast thou to the crime Of rash suspicion, added that of murder? Sifroy. My father, hear thy son. I plead not for My life, but justice.âThat I am a wretch, Groaning beneath the weight of Heaven's just ireâ That snar'd, and caught in meditated wiles, I banish'd from my house a guiltless wifeâ That burning with revenge, I flew to quench My wrath in Paulet's bloodâall this I own. But by the sacred eye of Providence! That views each human step, and still detects The murderer's deedâof this imputed crime My heart is ignorant, my hands are clear. Beaufort Senior. I wish thee innocentâ Glanville. Have then my words No weight? And is his own attesting hand No proof against him? Is her secret flight, An accident? No more?âO partial man! To hide thy daughter's shame, thou seek'st my life. But I appeal from thee to public justice. Beaufort Senior. To that thou art consign'd: and may the hand Of strict enquiry drag to open day All secret guilt, tho' shame indelible Should brand a daughter nearest to my heart. Heaven aid my search! I seek not blood, but truth. Guard safe our prisoners to the magistrate, I'll follow you. The justice thou demand'st, Thou shalt not want. Glanville. 'Tis well: I ask no more. Let Ragozin, let Isabella too Attend the magistrateâon them I call To clear my slander'd name. Beaufort Senior. It shall be so. Take them this instant to your strictest care. Thou too, Sifroy, be ready to attend. Sifroy. O think not I will leave him, till full proof Condemn him, or acquit. Beaufort Senior. The cause demands it. [Exeunt officers with Glanville guarded. SCENE V. Sifroy, Beaufort Senior. Sifroy. Whence has the miscreant this unusual firmness? Can guilt be free from terror? Beaufort Senior. No, my son: And thro' the mask of smooth Hypocrisy, Methinks I see conceal'd a trembling heart. If he be true, my daughter must be false: If he be guiltless, who hath murder'd Paulet? Sifroy. So speed my hopes as I am innocent. But oh, my love!âConduct me where she strays Forlorn and comfortless! Alas, who knowsâ Her tender heart perhaps this moment breaks With my unkindness! Wretch! what hast thou lost! [Enter Beaufort Junior. SCENE VI. Sifroy, Beaufort Senior, Beaufort Junior. Beaufort Junior. Thy soul's sweet peace!âNever, no never more To be regain'd!âShame, anguish, and despair Shall haunt thy future hours! Severe Remorse Shall strike his vulture talons thro' thy heart, And rend thy vital threads. Beaufort Senior. What means my son? Sifroy. My brother!âif I may conjure thee yet By that dear nameâ Beaufort Junior. Thou may'st notâI disclaim it! Sifroy. Why dost thou thus alarm my shuddering soul With rising terrors? Beaufort Senior. My dear son, relieve Thy father from this dread suspence! Beaufort Junior. O sir! how shall I speak! or in what words Unfold the horrors of this night?âMy sisterâ Lost to her wretched selfâthro' dreary wilds Wanders distractedâvoid of Reason's light To guide her devious steps. Beaufort Senior. Support me, Heaven! Then every hope is fled!âThy will be done!â Where is my child? Where was she found? Beaufort Junior. Alas! Of soul too delicate, too soft to bear Unjust reproach, and undeserved shame, Distraction seiz'd her in the gloom of night, As passing thro' the wood she sought the arms Of a protecting father. Sifroy. Do I live? Is such a wretch permitted still to breathe? Why opens not this earth? why sleeps above The lightening's vengeful blast? Is Heaven unjust? Or am I still reserv'd for deeper woe? I hope not mercyâthat were impiousâ Pour then on my bare head, ye ministers Of wrath! your hottest vengeanceâ Beaufort Junior. Stopâforbearâ Nor imprecate that vengeance which unseen, Already hangs o'er thy devoted life. O wretch! thou know'st not yet how curst thou art. Thy child, thy lovely child, a bloody corse, Lies breathless by its frantic mother's sideâ Murder'd, as it should seem, by her own hand, When Reason in her brain had lost dominion. Sifroy. O my torn heart!âIs there in Heaven no pity? But Fate's last bolt is thrown, and I am curst Beyond all power to aggravate my woe! O I am scorn'd, abandon'd, and cast out By Heaven and Earth!âI must not call thee fatherâ I have undone thee, robb'd thee of that name. Beaufort Senior. Forbear, my son, to aggravate thy woes, Already too severe. Kind Providence May yet restore, and harmonize her mind. Sifroy. May Heaven pour blessings on thy reverend head For that sweet hope! But say, where shall I see her?â How bear the dreadful sight! Beaufort Junior. Dreadful indeed! On the cold earth they found her laid: her head, Supported on her arm, hung o'er her child, The image of pale Grief lamenting Innocence. Sometimes she speaks fond words, and seems to smile On the dead babe as 'twere alive.âNow like The melancholy bird of night, she pours A soft and melting strain, as if to soothe Its slumbers:âand now clasps it to her breast, Cries Glanville is not hereâfear not, my love, He shall not comeâthen wildly throws her eyes Around, and in the tenderest accent calls Aloud on thee, to save her from dishonour! Sifroy. Haste, let us hasteâdistracted thus she grows Still dearer, still more precious to my soul! O let me soothe her sorrows into peace. Beaufort Senior. Stayâcalls she frequently on Glanville's name? Beaufort Junior. So they report who found her. Beaufort Senior. Left they her Alone? Beaufort Junior. No: but all arts to court her thence were vain. Beaufort Senior. Thither with speed this moment let us fly. Let Glanville too attend. From the wild words Of madness and delirium, he who struck From darkness lightâmay call Discovery forth, To guide our footsteps. Beaufort Junior. Just is your resolve, And I will follow youâbut have receiv'd Intelligence of somewhat that imports us, Which I must first attend. Beaufort Senior. To gain us light, Be no means left untry'd. [Exit Beaufort Junior. Sifroy. But haste, we linger. Yet whither can I fly? Where seek for peace? O in its tenderest vein my heart is wounded! Had I been smote in any other part, I could have born with firmness; but in Thee, My wrong'd, my ruin'd love, I bleed to death. End of the Fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE, the Wood. Cleone is discovered sitting by her dead child; over whom she hath form'd a little bower of shrubs and branches of trees. She seems very busy in picking the leaves from a bough in her hand. Cleone Sings. Largo Affetuose. Sweeter than the damask rose Was his lovely breast; There, O let me there repose, Sigh, sigh, and sink to rest. Did I not love him?âwho can say I did not? My heart was in his bosom, but he tore It out, and cast it from himâYet I lov'dâ And he more lovely seem'd to that fond heart, Than the bright cherub sailing on the skirts Of yonder cloud, th' inhabitant of Heaven. Enter Sifroy, Beaufort Sen. Isabella, Glanville, Ragozin, Officers, &amp;c. Beaufort Sen. This is the placeâO misery! See, my child! Why, gracious Heaven! why have I liv'd to feel This dreadful moment?âSoft I pray ye treadâ And let us well observe her speech and action. Sifroy. Have I done this!âand do I live!âmy heart Drops blood!âBut to thy guidance I will bend, And in forc'd silence smother killing grief. Glanville. [Aside.] Did'st thou not tell me, villain, she was dead? Ragozin. [Aside.] I was deceiv'dâby Heaven, I thought her so. Glanville. [Aside.] May Hell reward thee. Beaufort Sen. Stayâshe risesâhush! Cleone. Soft! soft! he stirsâ O I have wak'd himâI have wak'd my child! And when false Glanville knows it, he again Will murder him. Beaufort Sen. Mark that! Glanville. And are the words Of incoherent madness to convict me? Sifroy. They are the voice of Heaven, detecting murder! O villain! thy infernal aim appears. Cleone. No, no; all stillâAs undisturb'd he sleeps As the stolen infant rock'd in th' Eagle's nest. I'll call the red-breast, and the nightingale, Their pious bills once cover'd little babes, And sung them to repose. O come, sweet birds! Again pour forth your melancholy notes, And soothe once more that innocence ye love. Sifroy. On that enchanting voice, how my fond heart Hath hung with rapture!âNow, too deeply pierc'd, I die upon the sound. [He advances towards her. O let me soothe Thy griefs! and pour into thy wounded mind The healing balm of tenderness! Cleone, frighted and trembling. Sweet Heaven, Protect me! O if you pity, save My infant!âCast away that bloody steel! And on my knees I'll kiss the gentle hand, That spar'd my child!âGlanville shall never know But we are deadâIn this lone wood we'll live, And I no more will seek my husband's house. And yet I never wrong'd him! never indeed! Sifroy. I know thou did'st notâlook upon me, love! Dost thou not know me? I am thy Sifroyâ Thy husbandâDo not break my heartâO speak! That look will kill me! Beaufort Sen. My dear child! O turnâ Look on thy father! am I too forgot? Is every filial trace in thy poor brain Defac'd?âShe knows us not!âMay Heaven, my son Lend thee its best support! For meâmy days Are few; nor can my sorrow's date be long Protracted. Sifroy. Talk not so! Must I become The murderer of all I hold most dear? Cleone. Yesâyesâa husband onceâa father too I hadâbut lost, quite lostâdeep in my brain Bury'd they lieâin heaps of rolling sandâ I cannot find them. Sifroy. O heart-piercing grief! How is that fair, that amiable mind, Disjointed, blasted by the fatal rage Of one rash hour!â [She goes to her child, he follows. O let sweet Pity veil The horrors of this scene from every eye! My child! my child! hide, hide me from that sight! [Turns away. Cleone. Stay, stayâfor you are good, and will not hurt My lamb. Alas, you weepâwhy should you weep? I am his mother, yet I cannot weep. Have you more pity than a mother feels? But I shall weep no moreâmy heart is cold. Sifroy, falling on his knees. O mitigate thy wrath, good Heaven! Thou know'st My weaknessâlay not on thy creature more Than he can bear: Restore her, O restore! But if it must not beâif I am doom'd To stand a dreadful warning to deter Frail man from sudden passionâthen, great Power, O take, in mercy take, this wretched life! [As he rises, Isabella comes forward, and throws herself at his feet. Isabella. Hear, hear me, sir!âMy very heart is pierc'd! And my shock'd soul, beneath a load of guilt, Sinks down in terrors unsupportable. 'Tis Heaven impels me to reveal the crimes In which, O misery! I have been involv'dâ Protect me, save me from his desperate rage! [Glanville suddenly pulls out a short dagger, which he had conceal'd in his bosom; and attempts to stab her: Sifroy wrenches it from him. Beaufort Senior. Ha! seize the dagger! Sifroy. Hold thy murderous hand! Ragozin (Aside.) All is betray'dâfor me no safety now, But sudden flight. [He endeavours to withdraw. Sifroy. Stopâseizeâdetain that slave! Th' attempt to fly bespeaks him an accomplice. [One of the officers seizes him. Isabella, to Glanville. Tremble, O wretch!âThou see'st that Heaven is just, Nor suffers even our selves to hide our deeds. To death I yieldânor hope, nor wish for lifeâ Permit me to reveal some dreadful truths, And I shall die content. Thy hapless wife, Chaste as the purest angel of the sky, By Glanville is traduc'dâBy him betray'd, Paulet is murder'dâand by his device, The lovely child. Inveigled by his arts, And by the flattering hopes of wealth-isnar'dâ Distracting thought! I have destroy'd my soul. Beaufort Senior. O why so far from Virtue did'st thou stray, That to compassionate thy wretched fate, Almost is criminal! Beaufort Senior, to Glanville. But canst thou bearâ Can thy hard heart sustain this dreadful scene? Glanville. I know the worstâand am prepar'd to meet it. That wretch hath seal'd my deathâAnd had I but Aveng'd her timorous perfidyâthe rest I'd leave to Fate; and neither should lament My own, nor pity yours. Sifroy. Inhuman savage! But Justice shall, exert her keenest scourge, And wake to terror thy unfeeling heart. Guard them to safe confinement. But O see! Behold that piteous object!âHer dumb grief Speaks to my heart unutterable woe! Horror is in her silence-(he goes to her) My dear love! Look, look upon me! Let these tears prevail, And with thy pity, wake thy reason too. Cleone. Again you weepâO had you lost a wife, As I a husband, you might weep indeed! Or had you lost so sweet a boy as mine, 'Twould break your heart! Sifroy. O misery! her words are pointed steel! Have I not lost a wife?âlost a sweet boy? Indeed I have!âMy self too murder'd them! Cleone. That was unkindâWhy did you so?âBut soft! Let no one talk of murderâI was kill'dâ My husband murder'd meâbut I forgave him. Sifroy. I can sustain no more!âO torture! torture! Such goodness ruin'd, will distract my soul. Beaufort Sen. Collect thy self, and with the humble eye Of patient Hope, look up to Heaven resign'd. Sifroy. Hope! where is hope?âAlas, no hope for me! On downy pinions, lo! to Heaven she fliesâ To realms of blissâwhere I must never come! Terrors are mineâand from the depths below, Despair looks out, and beckons me to sink! Beaufort Sen. O calm thy grief! call reason to thy aid, Perhaps we yet may save her precious life; At least delay not, by some gentle means, To soothe her to return. Sifroy. May soft persuasion dwell upon thy lips! But ah, can tears or arguments avail, When Reason marks not? [Enter Beaufort Junior. SCENE III. Cleone, Sifroy, Beaufort Sen. Beaufort Jun. Beaufort Junior. Where, where is my sister? Beaufort Senior. Alas! the melancholy sight will pierce Thy inmost soul!âBut do not yet disturb her. Distraction o'er her memory hangs a cloud, That hides us from her. Sifroy. My dearest brother! can thy heart receive The wretch, who robb'd it of a sister's love? Beaufort Junior. I do forgive thee allâfor O my brother! Most basely wert thou wrong'd. But Truth is foundâ Paulet, tho' wounded, yet escap'd with life. Sifroy. Then Heaven is justâBut say, O tell me how! Beaufort Junior. Thou shalt know allâbut stay! my sisterâ Cleone, coming forward. O who hath done it!âwho hath done this deed Of death?âMy child is murder'dâmy sweet babe Bereft of life!âThou Glanville! thou art he! O bloody fiend! destroy a child! an infant!â O wretch, forbear!âSee, see the little heart Bleeds on his dagger's point! [Looking down to the earth. But lo! the Furies!âthe black fiends of hell Have seiz'd the Murderer! look! they tear his heartâ That heart which had no pity!âHark! he strikesâ His eye-balls glareâhis teeth together gnash In bitterness of anguishâWhile the fiends Scream in his frighted earâThou shalt not murder! Beaufort Senior. What dreadful visions terrify her brain? To interrupt her, must relieve.âSpeak to her. Sifroy. My dearest love!âCast but one look upon us! Cleone, looking up to heaven. Is that my infant?âWhither do ye bear My bleeding babe?âNot yetâO mount not yet, Ye sons of light, but take me on your wings, With my sweet innocentâI come! I come! [Her father and brother take hold of her. Yet hold! where is my husbandâmy Sifroy? Will not he follow?âWill he quite forsake His poor lost wife?âO tell him I was true! [Swoons. Beaufort Senior. Alas, she faints!âI fear the hand of Death Is falling on her. Gently bear her up. Sifroy. O God! my heartâ My heart-strings break!âDid not her dying words Dwell on my name? Did not her latest sigh Breathe tenderness for me?âfor me, the wretch, Whose rash suspicion, whose intemperate rage, Abandon'd her to shame!âHah! gracious Heaven! Does she not move? Does not returning light Dawn in her feeble eye? Her opening lips Breathe the sweet hope of life! Cleone. Where have I been? What dreadful dreams have floated in my brain! Beaufort Senior. How fares my child? Cleone. O faint! exceeding faint! My father!âMy dear father!âDo I wake? And am I, am I in a father's arms? My brother too!âO happy! Beaufort Junior. My dear sister! Sifroy. O transport! rapture! Will my love return To life? to reason too? Indulgent Heaven! Cleone. What sound, what well-known voice is that I hear! O lift me, raise me to his long-lost arms! It is my husband! my Sifroy! my love! Alas, too faintâI never more shall rise. Sifroy. O do not wound me, do not pierce my heart With any thought so dreadful! Hath high Heaven, Only in mockery given thee to my arms? Raise up thy head, my love! lean on my breast, And whisper to my soul thou wilt not die. Cleone. How thy sweet accents soothe the pangs of death! O witness Heaven! thus in thy arms to die, My faithful love, and spotless truth confirm'd, Was all my wish!âBut where, where is my father? O let me take his blessing up to Heaven, And I shall go with confidence! Beaufort Senior. My childâ My darling child!âMay that pure bliss, just Heaven Bestows upon departed saints, be thine! Cleone. Farewell, my brother! comfort and support Our father's feeble ageâTo heal his grief Will give thy sister's dying moments ease. Sifroy. Talk not of death!âWe must not, must not part! Good Heaven! her dying agonies approach! Cleone. Death's keenest, bitterest pang is that I feel For thy surviving woe.âAdieu, my love! I do entreat thee with my latest sigh, Restrain thy tearsânor let me grieve to think Thou feel'st a pain I cannot live to heal. Sifroy. Might'st thou but live, how light were every pain Fate could inflict! Cleone. It cannot be!âI faintâ My spirits failâfarewellâreceive me, Heaven [Dies. Sifroy. She's gone!âfor ever gone!âThose lovely eyes Are clos'd in deathâno more to look on me! My fate is finish'dâin this tortur'd breast, AnguishâRemorseâDespairâmust ever dwell. Beaufort Senior. Offended Power! at length with pitying eyes Look on our misery l Cut short this thread, That links my soul too long to wretched life! And let mankind, taught by his hapless fate, Learn one great truth, Experience finds too late; That dreadful ills from rash Resentment flow, And sudden Passions end in lasting Woe.

      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. By a Friend. Spoken by Mrs. Bellamy. Well, Ladiesâso much for the Tragic stileâ And now the custom isâto make you smile. To make us smile!âmethinks I hear you sayâ Why, who can help it, at so strange a Play? The Captain gone three yearsâand then to blame The faultless conduct of his virtuous dame! My stars!âwhat gentle Belle would think it treason, When thus provok'd, to give the brute some reason? Out of my house!âthis night, forsooth, depart! A modern wife had saidââWith all my heartâ âBut think not, haughty Sir, I'll go alone! âOrder your coachâconduct me safe to townâ âGive me my Jewels, Wardrobe, and my Maidâ âAnd pray take care my Pin-money be paid.â Such is the language of each modish Fair! Yet memoirs, not of modern growth, declare The time has been when modesty and truth Were deem'd additions to the charms of youth; When Women hid their necks, and veil'd their faces, Nor romp'd, nor rak'd, nor star'd at public places, Nor took the airs of Amazons for graces: Then plain domestic virtues were the mode, And wives ne'er dreamt of happiness abroad; They lov'd their children, learnt no flaunting airs, But with the joys of wedlock mixt the cares. Those times are pastâyet sure they merit praise, For Marriage triumph'd in those golden days: By chaste decorum they affection gain'd; By Faith and Fondness what they won, maintain'd. 'Tis yours, ye Fair, to bring those days agen, And form anew the hearts of thoughtless men; Make Beauty's lustre amiable as bright, And give the soul, as well as sense, delight; Reclaim from folly a fantastic age, That scorns the Press, the Pulpit, and the Stage. Let Truth and Tenderness your breasts adorn, The Marriage chain with transport shall be worn; Each blooming Virgin rais'd into a Bride, Shall double all their joys, their cares divide; Alleviate grief, compose the jars of strife, And pour the balm that sweetens human life.</field>
