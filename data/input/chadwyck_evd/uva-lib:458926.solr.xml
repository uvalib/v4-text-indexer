      <field name="fulltext">THE CHANCES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter two Serving-men, Peter and Anthony. Peter. I would we were remov'd from this Town, (Anthony) That we might taste some quiet: for mine owne part, I'me almost melted with continuall trotting After enquiries, dreames, and revelations, Of who knowes whom, or where? serve wenching soldiers, That know no other Paradice but Plackets: Ile serve a Priest in Lent first, and eate Bell-ropes. Anth. Thou art the froward'st fooleâ Pet. Why good tame Anthony? Tell me but this: to what end came we hither? An. To wait upon our Masters. Pet. But how Anthony? Answer me that; resolve me there good Anthony? An. To serve their uses. Pet. Shew your uses Anthony. An. To be imploy'd in any thing. Pet. No Anthony, Not any thing I take it; nor that thing We travell to discover, like new Islands; A salt itch serve such uses; in things of moment, Concerning things I grant yee, not things errant, Sweet Ladies things, and things to thank the Surgeon: In no such things, sweet Anthony, put caseâ An. Come, come, all will be mended: this invisible woman Of infinite report for shape and vertue, That bred us all this trouble to no purpose, They are determin'd now no more to thinke on, But fall close to their studies. Pet. Was there ever Men knowne to run mad with report before? Or wonder after that they know not where. To finde? or if found, how to enjoy? are mens braines Made now a dayes of Malt, that their affections Are never sober? but like drunken people Founder at every new fame? I do believe too That men in love are ever drunke, as drunken men Are ever loving. An. Prethee be thou sober, And know, that they are none of those, not guilty Of the least vanity of love, onely a doubt Fame might too farre report, or rather flatter The graces of this woman, made them curious To finde the truth, which since they finde so blotted And lock'd up from their searches, they are now setled To give the wonder ever. Pet. Would they were setled To give me some new shooes too: for Ile be sworne These are e'ne worne out to the reasonable soules In their good worships businesse: and some sleep Would not doe much amisse, unlesse they meane To make a Bell-man on me: and what now Meane they to study, Anthony, Morall Philosophy After their mar-all women? An. Mar a fooles head. Pet. 'Twill mar two fools heads, &amp; they take not heed, Besides the Giblets to 'em. An. Will you walke Sir, And talke more out of hearing? your fooles head May chance to finde a wooden night-cap else. Pet. I never lay in any. An. Then leave your lying, Enter Don John and Fredrick. And your blinde Prophesying: here they come, You had best tell them as much. Pet. I am no tell-tale. Exeunt. John. I would we could have seen her though: for sure She must be some rare creature, or report lyes, All mens reports too. Fred. I could well wish I had seen her; But since she is so conceal'd, so beyond venture Kept and preserv'd from view, so like a Paradice, Plac't where no knowledg can come near her; so guarded As 'twere impossible, though knowne to reach her, I have made up my beliefe. Joh. Hang me from this houre If I more thinke upon her, or believe her, But as she came a strong report unto me, So the next Fame shall loose her. Fred. 'Tis the next way: But whither are you walking? Joh. My old round After my meat, and then to bed. Fred. 'Tis healthfull. Joh. Will not you stir? Fred. I have a little businesse. Jo. Upon my life this Lady stillâ Fr. Then you will loose it. Jo. Pray let's walke together. Fr. Now I cannot. Jo. I have something to impart. Fr. An houre hence I will not misse to meet you. Jo. Where? Fr. Ith' high street; For not to lye, I have a few Devotions To doe first, then I am yours. Jo. Remember. Exeunt. ScÃ¦n. 2. Enter Petruchio, Antonio, and two Gent. Ant. Cut his winde-pipe, I say. 1 Gent. Fie Antonio. Ant. Or knock his brains out first, &amp; then forgive him If you doe thrust, be sure it be to th'hilts, A Surgeon may see through him. 1. You are too violent, 2. Too open, undiscreet. Pet. Am I not ruin'd? The honour of my house crack'd? my bloud poyson'd? My credit, and my name? 2. Be sure it be so, Before ye use this violence. Let not doubt, And a suspecting anger so much sway ye, Your wisedome may be question'd. Ant. I say kill him, And then dispute the cause; cut off what may be, And what is, shall be safe. 2. Hang up a true man, Because 'tis possible he may be theevish: Alas, is this good Justice? Petr. I know as certaine, As day must come againe; as cleare as truth. And open as beliefe can lay it to me, That I am basely wrong'd, wrong'd above recompence; Malitiously abus'd, blasted for ever In name and honour, lost to all remembrance, But what is smear'd, and shamefull; I must kill him, Necessitie compells me. 1. But think better Petr. There is no other cure left: yet witnesse with me All that is faire in man, all that is noble, I am not greedy of this life I seek for, Nor thirst to shed mans bloud; and would 'twere possible I wish it with my soule, so much I tremble To offend the sacred Image of my Maker, My sword could onely kill his crimes: no 'tis honour, Honour, my noble friends, that idoll honour, That all the world now worships, not Petruchio Must doe this justice. Ant. Let it once be done, And 'tis no matter, whether you, or honour, Or both be accessarie. 2. Doe you weigh Petruchio The value of the person, power, and greatnesse, And what this sparke may kindle? Petr. To performe it, So much I am ty'd to reputation, And credit of my house, let it raise wild-fires, That all this Dukedome smoak, and stormes that tosse me Into the stormes of everlasting ruine, Yet I must through; if yee dare side me. Ant. Dare? Petr. Ye're friends indeed, if not. 2. Here's none flies from you, Doe it in what designe ye please, wee'll back ye. 1. But then be sure yee kill him. 2. Is the cause So mortall, nothing but his life? Pet. Beleeve me, A lesse offence has been the desolation Of a whole name. 1. No other way to purge it? Pet. There is, but never to be hoped for, 2. Thinke an houre more, And if then ye finde no safer road to guide yee, Wee'll set up our rests too. Ant. Mine's up already, And hang him for my part, Goes lesse than life. 2. If we see noble cause, 'tis like our swords May be as free and forward as your words. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne. 3. Enter Don John. John. The civill order of this Towne Bellonia Makes it belov'd, and honour'd of all travellers, As a most safe retirement in all troubles; Beside the wholsome seat, and noble temper Of those mindes that inhabit it, safely wise, And to all strangers vertuous: But I see My admiration has drawne night upon me, And longer to expect my friend may pull me Into suspition of too late a stirrer, Which all good Governments are jealous of. Ile home, and thinke at liberty: yet certaine, 'Tis not so farre night as I thought; for see, A faire house yet stands open, yet all about it Are close, and no lights stirring: there may be foule play: Ile venture to look in: if there be knaves, I may doe a good office. (Woman within. Within. Signieur? John. What? how is this? [Woman] Within. Signieur Fabritio? John. Ile goe nearer. [Woman] Within. Fabritio? Joh. This is a womans tongue, here may be good done. [Woman] Within. Who's there? Fabritio? Joh. I. [Woman] Within. Where are ye? Joh. Here. [Woman] Within. O come, for heavens sake! Joh. I must see what this meanes, Enter Woman with a childe. [Woman] Within. I have stay'd this long houre for you, make no noise, For things are in strange trouble: here, be secret, 'Tis worth your care; begone now; more eyes watch us, Then may be for our safeties. Joh. Harke ye? [Woman] Within. Peace: good night. Joh. She is gone, and I am loaden; fortune for me; It weighes well, and it feeles well; it may chance To be some pack of worth: by th'masse 'tis heavie; If it be Coyne or Jewels, 'tis worth welcome: Ile ne're refuse a fortune: I am confident 'Tis of no common price: now to my lodging: If it hit right, Ile blesse this night. Exit. ScÃ¦ne 4. Enter Fredrick. Fred. 'Tis strange, I cannot meet him; sure he has encountred Some light o' love or other, and there meanes To play at In and In for this night. Well Don John, If you doe spring a leak, or get an itch, Til ye claw off your curl'd pate, thank your night-walks: You must be still a bootehalling: one round more, Though it be late, Ile venture to discover ye, I doe not like your out-leaps. ScÃ¦ne 5. Enter Duke, and 3. Gentlemen. Duke. Welcome to Towne, are ye all fit? 1. To point Sir, Duke. Where are the horses? 2. Where they were appointed. Duk. Be private, and whatsoever fortune Offer it selfe, let's stand sure. 3. Feare not us, 'Ere ye shall be endangered, or deluded, Wee'll make a black night on't. Du. No more, I know it; You know your Quarters? 1. Will you goe alone sir? Du. Ye shall not be farre from me, the least noise Shall bring ye to my rescue. 2. We are counsell'd. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 6. Enter Don John. Iohn. Was ever man so paid for being curious? Ever so bob'd for searching out adventures, As I am? did the devill lead me? must I needs be peeping Into mens houses where I had no businesse, And make my selfe a mischiefe? 'Tis well carried; I must take other mens occasions on me, And be I know not whom: most finely handled: What have I got by this now? what's the purchase? A piece of evening Arras worke, a childe, Indeed an Infidell: this comes of peeping: A lumpe got out of lazinesse; good white bread Let's have no bawling with yee: 'sdeath, have I Knowne Wenches thus long, all the wayes of wenches, Their snares and subtilties? have I read over All their Schoole learnings, div'd into their quiddits, And am I now bum-fidled with a Bastard? Fetch'd over with a Carde of five, and in mine old dayes, After the dire massacre of a million Of Maiden-heads? caught the common way, ith' night too Under anothers name, to make the matter Carry more weight about it? well Don Iohn, You will be wiser one day, when ye have purchas'd A beavy of these Butter prints together, With searching out conceal'd iniquities, Without commission: why, it would never grieve me, If I had got this Ginger-bread: never stirr'd me, So I had had a stroak for't: 't had been Justice Then to have kept it; but to raise a dayrie For other mens adulteries, consume my 'selfe in candles, And scowring works, in Nurses Bells and Babies, Onely for charity, for meere I thank you, A little troubles me: the least touch for it, Had but my breeches got it, had contented me. Whose e're it is, sure t'had a wealthy mother, For 'tis well cloathed, and if I be not cozen'd, Well lin'd within: to leave it here were barbarous, And ten to one would kill it: a more sin Then his that got it: well, I will dispose on't, And keep it, as they keep deaths heads in rings, To cry, memento to me; no more peeping. Now all the danger is to qualifie The good old gentlewoman, at whose house we live, For she will fall upon me with a Catechisme Of foure houres long: I must endure all; For I will know this mother: Come good wonder, Let you and I be jogging: your starv'd trebble Will waken the rude watch else: All that bee Curious night-walkers, may they finde my fee. Exit. ScÃ¦n. 7. Enter Fredrick. Fred. Sure hee's gone home: I have beaten all the purlewes, But cannot bolt him: if he be a bobbing 'Tis not my care can cure him: To morrow morning I shall have further knowledge from a Surgeonsâ Where he lyes moord, to mend his leaks. Enter Constantia. Con, I'me ready, And through a world of dangers am flown to yee. Be full of haste and care, we are undone else: Where are your people? which way must we travell? For heaven sake stay not here sir. Fred. What may this prove? Con. Alas I am mistaken, lost, undone. For ever perish'd. Sir, for heaven sake tell me, Are ye a Gentleman? Fred. I am. Con. Of this place? Fred. No, borne in Spain. Con. As ever you lov'd honour, As ever your desires may gaine their ends, Doe a poore wretched woman but this benefit, For I am forc'd to trust yee. Fred. Y'ave charm'd me, Humanity and honour bids me helpe ye; And if I faile your trust.â Con. The time's too dangerous To stay your protestations: I beleeve ye, Alas, I must believe ye: From this place, Good noble Sir, remove me instantly, And for a time, where nothing but your selfe. And honest conversation may come neare me, In some secure place sertle me. What I am, And why thus boldly I commit my credit Into a strangers hand, the feares and dangers, That force me to this wilde course, at more leisure I shall reveale unto you. Fred. Come, be hearty, He must strike through my life that takes ye from me. (Exi ScÃ¦ne 8. Enter Petruchio, Antonio, and 2. Gent. Petr. He will sure come. Are yee well arm'd? Ant. Never feare us. Here's that will make 'em dance without a Fiddle. Petr. We are to look for no weak foes, my friends, Nor unadvised ones. Ant. Best gamsters make the best game, We shall fight close and handsome then. 1 Gent. Antonio, You are a thought too bloudy. Ant. Why? all Physitians And penny Almanacks allow the opening Of veines this moneth: why doe ye talke of bloudy? What come we for, to fall to cuffes for apples? What, would ye make the Cause a Cudgell quarell? On what termes stands this man? is not his honour Open'd to his hand, and pickt out like an Oyster? His credit like a quart pot knockt together. Able to hold no liquor? cleare but this point. Petr. Speak softly, gentle Couzen. Ant. Ile speak truely; What should men doe ally'd to these disgraces, Lick o're his enemie, sit downe, and dance him? 2. You are as farre o'th' bow hand now. Ant. And crie; That's my fine boy, thou wilt doe so no more child. Pet. Here are no such cold pitties. Ant. By Saint Jaques They shall not finde me one: here's old tough Andrew, A speciall friend of mine, and he but hold, Ile strike 'em such a horne-pipe: knocks I come for, And the best bloud I light on; I profes it, Not to scarre Coster-mongers; If I loose mine owne, Mine audits lost, and fare-well five and fifty. Pet. Let's talke no longer, place your selves with silence, As I directed yee; and when time calls us, As ye are friends, so shew your selves. Ant. So be it. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne. 9. Enter Don John and his Land-lady. Land. Nay Son, if this be your regard. Jo. Good mother. Lan. Good me no goods; your Cozen, and your self Are welcome to me, whilst you beare your selves Like honest and true Gentlemen: Bring hither To my house, that have ever been reputed A gentlewoman of a decent, and faire carriage, And so behav'd my self? Jo. I know ye have. Lan. Bring hither, as I say, to make my name Stinke in my neighbours nostrills? your Devises, Your Brats, got out of Alligant, and broken oathes? Your Linsey Woolsey worke, your hasty puddings? I foster up your silch'd iniquities? Y'are deceiv'd in me, Sir, I am none Of those receivers. Jo. Have I not sworne unto you, 'Tis none of mine, and shew'd you how I found it? Land. Ye found an easie foole that let you get it, She had better have worne pasternes. Jo. Will yee heare me? Lan. Oathes? what doe you care for oathes to gaine your ends, When ye are high and pamper'd? What Saint know ye? Or what Religion, but your purpos'd lewdnesse, Is to be look'd for of ye? nay, I will tell ye, You will then sweare like accus'd Cut-purses, As far of truth too; and lye beyond all Faulconers: I'me sick to see this dealing. Jo. Heaven forbid Mother. La. Nay, I am very sick. Jo. Who waits there? Ant. Sir. within. Jo. Bring down the bottle of Canary wine. La. Exceeding sick, heav'n helpe me. Jo. Haste ye sirrah, I must ev'n make her drunk; nay gentle mother; Lan. Now fie upon ye, was it for this purpose You fetch'd your evening walks for your digestions, For this pretended holinesse? no weather, Not before day could hold ye from the Matins. Were these your bo-peep prayers? ye' have praid well, And with a learned zeale: watcht well too; your Saint It seems was pleas'd as well: still sicker, sicker. Enter Anthony with a bottle of wine. Jo. There is no talking to her till I have drencht her. Give me: here mother take a good round draught, 'Twill purge spleen from your spirits: deeper mother. Lan. I, I, sonne; you imagine this will mend all. Jo. All y'faith Mother. Lan. I confesse the Wine Will doe his part. Jo. Ile pledge ye. La. But sonne John. Jo. I know your meaning mother; touch it once more, Alas you look not well; take a round draught, It warmes the bloud well, and restores the colour, And then wee'll talke at large. Land. A civill gentleman? A stranger? one the Town holds a good regard of? Jo. Nay I will silence there. Lan. One that should weigh his faire name? oh, a stich! Jo. There's nothing better for a stitch, good mother, Make no spare of it, as you love your health, Mince not the matter. Land. As I said, a gentleman, Lodge in my house? now heav'ns my comfort, Signior! Jo. I look'd for this. Lan. I did not thinke you would have us'd me thus; A woman of my credit: one, heaven knowes, That lov'd you but too tenderly. Jo. Deare mother, I ever found your kindnesse, and acknowledge it. Lan. No, no, I am a fool to counsell yee. Where's the infant? Come, lets see your Workmanship. Jo. None of mine, Mother. But there 'tis, and a lusty one. Land. Heaven blesse thee, Thou hadst a hasty making; but the best is, 'Tis many a good mans fortune: as I live Your owne eyes Signior, and the nether lip As like yee, as ye had spit it. Jo. I am glad on't. Lan. Blesse me, what things are these? Jo. I thought my labour Was not all lost, 'tis gold, &amp; these are jewels, Both rich, and right I hope. Lan. Well, well sonne Iohn, I see ye are a wood-man, and can chuse Your Deere, though it be i'th darke, all your discretion Is not yet lost; this was well clapt aboard: Here I am with you now; when as they say Your pleasure comes with profit; when ye must needs do, Doe where ye may be done to, 'tis a wisedome Becomes a young man well: be sure of one thing, Loose not your labour and your time together, It seasons of a foole, sonne, time is pretious, Worke wary whilst ye have it: since ye must traffick Sometimes this slippery way, take sure hold Signior, Trade with no broken Merchants, make your lading, As you would make your rest, adventurously, But with advantage ever. Io. All this time mother, The childe wants looking too, wants meat and Nurses. Lan. Now blessing o' thy care; it shall have all, And instantly; Ile seek a Nurse my selfe, sonne; 'Tis a sweet childe: ah my young Spaniard; Take you no further care sir. Io. Yes of these Jewels, I must by your leave Mother: these are yours, To make your care the stronger: for the rest Ile finde a Master; the gold for bringing up on't, I freely render to your charge. Lan. No more words, Nor no more children, (good sonne) as you love me, This may doe well. Ioh. I shall observe your Morals. But where's Don Ferdinand (Mother) Lan. Ten to one About the like adventure: he told me. He was to finde you out. Exit. Io. Why should he stay thus? There may be some ill chance in't: sleep I will not, Before I have found him: now this woman's pleas'd, Ile seek my friend out, and my care is eas'd. Exit. ScÃ¦ne. 10. Enter Duke and Gent. 1 Gen. Beleeve sir, 'tis as possible to doe it, As to remove the City; the maine faction, Swarm throgh the streets like hornets, arm'd with angers Able to ruine States: no safety left us, Nor meanes to dye like men, if instantly You draw not back againe, Duk. May he be drawne And quarter'd too, that turnes now; were I surer Of death then thou art of thy fears, and with death More then those feares are too. 1. Sir, I feare not. Du. I would not crack my vow, start from my honour, Because I may finde danger; wound my soule, To keep my body safe. 1. I speak not sir, Out of a basenesse to you. Du. No, nor doe not Out of a basenesse leave me: what is danger. More then the weaknesse of our apprehensions? A poor cold part o'th bloud? who takes it hold of? Cowards, and wicked livers: valiant mindes Were made the Masters of it, and as hearty Seamen In desperate stormes, stem with a little Rudder The tumbling ruines of the Ocean: So with their cause &amp; swords do they do dangers. Say we were sure to dye all in this venture, As I am confident against it: is there any Amongst us of so fat a sense, so pamper'd, Would chuse luxuriously to lye a bed, And purge away his spirit, send his soule out In Sugar-sops, and Syrups? give me dying, As dying ought to be, upon mine enemy, Parting with man-kinde, by a man that's manly: Let 'em be all the world, and bring along Cain's envy with 'em, I will on. 2. You may sir, But with what safety? 1. Since 'tis come to dying. You shall perceive sir, here be those amongst us Can dye as decently as other men, And with as little ceremony: on brave sir. Duk. That's spoken heartily. 1. And he that flinches May he dye lowzie in a ditch. Du. No more dying, There's no such danger in it: What's a clock? 3. Somewhat above your houre. Du. Away then quickly, Make no noise, and no trouble will attend us. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 11. Enter Fredericke, and Peter, (with a candle.) Fred. Give me the candle: so goe you out that way. Pet. What have we now to doe? Fred. And o' your life sirrah, Let none come neare the doore without my knowledge, No not my Landlady, nor my friend. Pet. 'Tis done sir. Fr. Nor any serious businesse that concerns me. Pet. Is the winde there agen? Fr. Be gone. Pet. I am sir. Exit. Enter Constantia with a Jewell. Fr. Now enter without feare.âAnd noble Lady That safety and civility yee wish'd for Shall truely here attend you: no rude tongue Nor rough behaviour knows this place, no wishes Beyond the moderation of a man, Dare enter here: your owne desires and Innocence, Joyn'd to my vow'd obedience, shall protect you, Were dangers more then doubts. Const. Ye are truely noble, And worth a womans trust: let it become me, (I doe beseech you sir) for all your kindnesse, To render with my thanks, this worthlesse trifle; I may be longer troublesome. Fred. Faire offices Are still their owne rewards: Heav'n blesse me Lady From selling civill courtesies: may it please ye, If ye will force a favour to oblige me, Draw but that cloud aside, to satisfie me For what good Angel I am engag'd. Const. It shall be. For I am truely confident yee are honest: The Piece is scarce worth looking on. Fred. Trust me The abstract of all beauty, soule of sweetnesse, Defend me honest thoughts. I shall grow wilde else: What eyes are there, rather what little heavens, To stirre mens contemplations? what a Paradice Runs through each part she has? good bloud be temperate: I must look off: too excellent an object Confounds the sense that sees it. Noble Lady, If there be any further service to cast on me, Let it be worth my life, so much I honour ye, Or the engagement of whole Families. Const. Your service is too liberall, worthy sir, Thus farre I shall entreat. Fred. Command me Lady. You make your power too poore. Const. That presently With all convenient haste, you would retire Unto the street you found me in. Fred. 'Tis done. Const. There, if you finde a gentleman opprest With force and violence, doe a mans office, And draw your sword to rescue him. Fred. Hee's safe, Be what he will, and let his foes be devills, Arm'd with your pitty. I shall conjure 'em. Retire, this key will guide ye: all things necessary Are there before ye. Const. All my prayers goe with ye. Exit. Fred. Ye clap on proof upon me: men say gold Do's all, engages all, works through all dangers: Now I say beauty can do more: The Kings Exchequer, Nor all his wealthy Indies, could not draw me Through halfe those miseries this peece of pleasure Might make me leap into: we are all like sea-Cards, All our endeavours and our motions, (As they doe to the North) still point at beauty, Still at the fairest: for a handsome woman, (Setting my soule a side) it should goe hard, But I would straine my body: yet to her, Unlesse it be her owne free gratitude, Hopes ye shall dye, and thou tongue rot within me, E're I infringe my faith: now to my rescue. Exit.</field>

May I crave sir, But thus much honour more, to know your name? And him I am so bound to? Ioh. For the Bond sir, 'Tis every good mans tye: to know me further Will little profit ye; I am a stranger, My Countrey Spaine; my name Don Iohn, a gentleman That lyes here for my study. Du. I have heard sir, Much worthy mention of ye, yet I finde Fame short of what ye are. Iohn. You are pleas'd sir, To expresse your courtesie: may I demand As freely what you are, and what mischance Cast you into this danger? Du. For this present I must desire your pardon: you shall know me Ere it be long sir, and a nobler thanks, Then now my will can render. Ioh. Your will's your owne sir. Du. What is't you look for sir, have yee lost any thing? Io. Onely my hat i'th scuffle; sure these fellowes Were night-snaps. Du. No, believe sir: pray ye use mine, For 'twil be hard to finde your owne now. Ioh. No sir. Du. Indeed ye shall, I can command another: I doe beseech ye honour me. Io. I will sir, And so Ile take my leave. Du. Within these few dayes I hope I shall be happy in your knowledge. Till when I love your memory. Io. I yours. Exit Duke, &amp;c. Enter Fredrick. This is some noble fellow. Fred. 'Tis his tongue sure. Don Iohn? Ioh. Don Fredrick? Fred. Ye' are fairely met sir: I thought ye had been a Bat-fowling: prethee tell me, What Revelations hast thou had to night, That home was never thought of? Io. Revelations? Ile tell thee Fredrick. but before I tell thee, Settle thy understanding. Fred. 'Tis prepar'd, sir. Io. Why then mark what shall follow. This night Fredr. This bawdy night. Fred. I thought no lesse. Ioh. This blinde night, What dost think I have got? Fred. The Pox it may be. Io.

Peeping into a house, by whom I know not, Nor where to find the place agen: no Fredricke, Had I but kist the ring fort; 'tis no poor one, That's my best comfort, for't has brought about it Enough to make it man. Fr. Where is't? Io. At home. Fr. A saving voyage: But what will you say Signior. To him that searching out your serious Worship, Has met a stranger fortune? Joh. How, good Frederick? A militant girle now to this boy would hit it? Fred. No, mine's a nobler venture: What do you think Sir Of a distressed Lady one whose beauty Would oversell all Italy? Joh. Where is sheâ Fred. A woman of that rare behaviour, So qualified, as admiration Dwels round about her: of that perfect spiritâ Joh. I marry Sir. Fred.

I have her sure Boy. Joh. Harke ye Fredrick. What truck betwixt my Infant? Fred. 'Tis too light Sir, Stick to your charges good Don John, I am well. Joh. But is there such a wench? Fred. First tell me this, Did ye not lately as ye walk'd along, Discover people that were arm'd, and likely To doe offence? Ioh. Yes mary, and they urg'd it As far as they had spirit. Fred. Pray goe forward. Ioh. A Gentleman I found ingag'd amongst 'em, It seemes of noble breeding, I'm sure brave mettall, As I return'd to looke you, I set in to him, And without hurt (I thanke heaven) rescued him, And came my selfe off safe too. Fred. My work's done then: And now to satisfie you, there is a woman, Oh Iohn, there is a womanâ Ioh. Oh, where is she? Fred.

By all our friendship, Iohn, 'Tis honest, and of great end. Ioh. I am answer'd: But let me see her though: leave the doore open As yee goe in. Fr. I dare not. Io.

I, there it goes: my Masters bo-peep with me, With his slye popping in and out agen, Argued a cause, a frippery cause. Pet. Beleeve me, They bear up with some carvell. Ant. I doe believe thee, For thou hast such a Master for that chase, That till he spend his maine Mastâ Pet.

Stay, now she sings. Ioh. An Angels voice Ile sweare. Fred. Why did'st thou shrug so? Either allay this heat; or as I live I will not trust ye. Ioh. Passe: I warrant ye. Exeunt. Enter Constantia. Con. To curse those starres, that men say governe us, To raile at fortune, fall out with my Fate, And taske the generall world, will helpe me nothing: Alas, I am the same still, neither are they Subject to helpes, or hurts: Our owne desires Are our owne fates, our owne stars, all our fortunes, Which as we sway 'em, so abuse, or blesse us. Enter Fredrick, and Don John peeping. Fred. Peace to your meditations. Joh. Pox upon ye, Stand out oth' light. Const. I crave your mercy sir, My minde o're-charg'd with care made me unmannerly. Fr. Pray yee set that minde at rest, all shall be perfect. Io. I like the body rare; a handsome body, A wondrous handsome body: would she would turne: See, and that spightfull puppy be not got Between me and my light againe, Fr. Tis done, As all that you command shall bee: the gentleman Is safely off all danger. Ioh. O de dios. Const. How shall I thank ye sir? how satisfie? Fr. Speak softly, gentle Lady, all's rewarded, Now does he melt like Marmalad. Io. Nay, 'tis certaine, Thou art the sweetest woman I e're look'd on: I hope thou art not honest. Fred. None disturb'd yee? Const. Not any sir, nor any sound came neare me, I thank your care. Fred. 'Tis well. Ioh. I would faine pray now, But the Devill and that flesh there, o' the world, What are we made to suffer? Fr. Hee'll enter; Pull in your head and be hang'd. Ioh. Harke ye Fredricke, I have brought ye home your Pack-saddle. Fr. Pox upon yee. Con. Nay let him enter: fie my Lord the Duke, Stand peeping at your friends. Fr. Ye are cozen'd Lady, Here is no Duke. Const. I know him full well Signior. Ioh. Hold thee there wench. Fre. This mad-brain'd foole will spoile all. Con. I doe beseech your grace come in. Ioh. My Grace, There was a word of comfort. Fred. Shall he enter, Who e're he be? Ioh. Well follow'd Fredrick. Const. With all my heart. Fred. Come in then. Enter Don John. Jo. 'Blesse yee Lady: Fr. Nay start not, though he be a stranger to ye, Hee's of a Noble straine, my kinsman, Lady, My Countrey-man, and fellow Traveller, One bed containes us ever, one purse feeds us, And one faith free between us; do not fear him, Hee's truely honest. Jo. That's a lye. Fred. And trusty: Beyond your wishes: valiant to defend, And modest to converse with, as your blushes. Jo. Now may I hang my self; this commendation Has broke the neck of all my hopes: for now Must I cry, no forsooth, and I forsooth, and surely, And truely as I live, and as I am honest. Has done these things for 'nonce too; for hee knowes, Like a most envious Rascall as he is, I am not honest, nor desire to be, Especially this way: h'as watch'd his time, But I shall quit him. Const. Sir, I credit ye. Fred. Goe kisse her John. Joh. Plague o' your commendations. Con. Sir, I shall now desire to be a trouble. Jo. Never to me, sweet Lady: Thus I seale My faith, and all my service. Con. One word Signeur. Jo. Now 'tis impossible I should be honest, She kisses with a conjuration Would make the devill dance: what points she at? My leg I warrant, or my well knit body: Sit fast Don Fredrick. Fred. 'Twas given him by that gentleman You took such care of, his owne being lost ith' scuffle. Con. With much joy may he weare it: 'tis a right one, I can assure ye Gentleman, and right happy May you be in all fights for that faire service. Fred. Why doe ye blush? Con. 'T had almost cozen'd me, For not to lye, when I saw that, I look'd for Another Master of it: but 'tis well. Fr. Who's there? Knock within. Ent. Anthony. Stand ye a little close: Come in Sir, Now what's the newes with you? Anth. There is a gentlemen without, Would speak with Don John, Ioh. Who sir? Ant. I do not know Sir, but he shews a man Of no meane reckoning. Fred. Let him shew his name, And then returne a little wiser. Ant. Well Sir. Exit Anthony. Fred. How doe you like her Iohn? Ioh. As well as you Fredrick, For all I am honest: you shall finde it so too. Fred. Art thou not honest? Ioh. Art thou an Asse? And modest as her blushes? What a block-head Would e're have popt out such a dry Apologie, For his deare friend? and to a Gentlewoman, A woman of her youth, and delicacy. They are arguments to draw them to abhorre us. An honest morall man; 'tis for a Constable: A handsome man, a wholsome man, a tough man, A liberall man, a likely man, a man Made up like Hercules, unslak'd with service: The same to night, to morrow night, the next night, And so to perpetuitie of pleasures, These had been things to hearken too, things catching: But you have such a spiced consideration, Such qualmes upon your worships conscience, Such-chil-blaines in your bloud, that all things pinch ye, Which nature, and the liberall world makes custome, And nothing but faire honour, O sweet honour, Hang up your Eunuch honour: That I was trusty, And valiant, were things well put in; but modest! A modest gentleman I Ã´ wit where wast thou? Fred. I am sorrie John, John. My Ladies gentlewoman Would laugh me to a Schoole-boy, make me blush With playing with my Codpeece point: fie on thee, A man of thy discretion? Fred. It shall be mended: And henceforth yee shall have your due. Enter Anthony. John. I look fort: How now, who is't? An. A gentleman of this towne And calls himselfe Petruchio. Enter Constantia. John. Ile attend him. Const. How did he call himselfe. Fred. Petruchio, Doe's it concerne you ought? Const. O gentlemen, The houre of my destruction is come on me, I am discover'd, lost, left to my ruine: As ever ye had pittyâ John. Doe not feare, Let the great devill come, he shall come through me: Lost here, and we about ye? Fred. Fall before us? Const. O my unfortunate estate, all angers Compar'd to his, to hisâ Fred. Let his, and all mens, Whilst we have power and life: stand up for heaven sake. Con. I have offended heaven too; yet heaven knowsâ Iohn. We are all evill: Yet heaven forbid we should have our deserts. What is a? Con. Too too neare to my offence sir; O he will cut me peece-meale. Fred. 'Tis no Treason? John. Let it be what it will: if a cut here, Ile finde him cut-worke. Fred. He must buy you deare, With more than common lives. Joh. Feare not, nor weep not: By heaven Ile fire the Towne before yee perish, And then, the more the merrier, wee'll jog with yee. Fred. Come in, and dry your eyes. John. Pray no more weeping: Spoile a sweet face for nothing? my returne Shall end all this I warrant you. Con. Heaven grant it. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 3. Enter Petruchio with a Letter. Petr. This man should be of speciall rank: For these commends carry no common way, No slight worth with 'em: A shall be he. Ent. Don Iohn. John. 'Save yee sir: I am sorrie My businesse was so unmannerly, to make ye Wait thus long here. Petr. Occasions must be serv'd sir: But is your name Don John? Ioh. It is Sir. Petr. Then, First, for your owne brave sake I must embrace yee: Next, from the credit of your noble friend Hernando de Aluara, make yee mine: Who layes his charge upon me in this Letter To look yee out, and for the goodnesse in yee, Whilst your occasions make yee resident In this place, to supply yee, love and honour yee; Which had I knowne soonerâ Iohn. Noble sir, You'll make my thanks too poore: I weare a sword, sir, And have a service to be still dispos'd of, As you shall please command it. Petr. Gentle sir, That manly courtesie is half my businesse: And to be short, to make ye know I honour ye, And in all points believe your worth like Oracle, And how above my friends, which are not few, And those not slack, I estimate your vertues. Make your selfe understand, This day Petruchio, A man that may command the strength of this place, Hazzard the boldest spirits; hath made choice Onely of you, and in a noble office. Ioh.

Ferrara's Duke, would I might call him worthie, But that he has raz'd out from his family, As he has mine with Infamie, This man, Rather this powerfull Monster, we being left But two of all our house, to stock our memories, My Sister, and my selfe; with arts, and witch-crafts, Vowes, and such oathes heaven has no mercy for, Drew to dishonour this weak maid, by stealthes, And secret passages I knew not of, Oft he obtain'd his wishes, oft abus'd her: I am asham'd to say the rest: This purchas'd, And his hot bloud allay'd, as friends forsake us At a miles end upon our way, he left her, And all our name to ruine. Ioh. This was foule Play, And ought to be rewarded so. Petr. I hope so; He scap'd me yester-night: which if he dare Againe adventure for, heaven pardon him, I shall with all my heart. Ioh. For me, brave Signior, What doe yee intend? Petr. Onely, faire sir, this trust, Which from the commendations of this Letter, I dare presume well placed, nobly to beare him By word of mouth a single challenge from me, That man to man, if he have honour in him, We may decide all difference.

It shall be; Sister to Don Petruchio: I know all man. Fred. Now I beleeve. Iohn. Goe to, there has been stirring, Fumbling with Linnen Fredrick. Fred. 'Tis impossible, You know her fame was pure as fire. Ioh. That pure fire Has melted out her maiden-head: she is crackt: We have all that hope of our side, boy. Fred, Thou tell'st me, To my imagination, things incredible: I see no loose thought in her. Ioh. That's all one, She is loose ith' hilts by heaven: but the world must know A faire way, upon vow of marriage. Fred. There may be such a slip. Iohn. And will be Fredrick. Whil'st the old game's a foot: I feare the boy too Will prove hers too I took up. Fred. Good circumstance May cure all this yet. Iohn. There thou hitst it, Fredrick: Come, let's walke in and comfort her: her being here Is nothing yet suspected: anon Ile tell thee Wherefore her brother came, who by this light Is a brave noble fellow, and what honour H'as done to me a stranger: there be Irons Heating for some, will hisle into their heart blouds, 'Ere all be ended; so much for this time.

I have told yee all I can, and more then yet Those Gentlemen know of me; ever trusting Your Councell and concealement: for to me You seem a worthy woman; one of those Are seldome found in our sex, wise and vertuous, Direct me I beseech ye. Land. Ye say well Lady, And hold yee to that poynt; for in these businesses A womans councell that conceives the matter, (Doe ye marke me, that conceives the matter Lady) Is worth ten mens engagements: She knows something And out of that can worke like wax: when men Are giddy-headed, either out of wine, Or a more drunkennesse, vaine ostentation, Discovering all: there is no more keep in 'em, Then hold upon an Eeles taile: nay 'tis held fashion To defame now all they can. Con. I, but these gentlemenâ Land. Doe not you trust to that: these gentlemen Are as all Gentlemen of the same Barrell: I, and the selfe same pickle too. Be it granted, They have us'd yee with respect and faire behaviour, Yet since ye came: doe you know what must follow? They are Spaniards, Lady, Gennets of high mettle, Things that will thrash the devill, or his dam, Let 'em appeare but cloven. Con. Now heaven blesse me. Lan. Mad Colts will court the wind: I know 'em Lady To the least haire they have; and I tell you, Old as I am, let but the pinte pot blesse 'em, They'll offer to my yearesâ Con. How? Lan. Such rude gambollsâ Con. To you? Lan. I, and so handle me, that oft I am forc'd To fight of all foure for my safety: there's the yonger, Don John, the arrantst Jack in all this City: The other, time has blasted, yet he will stoop, If not ore-flowne, and freely on the quarry; Has been a Dragon in his dayes. But Tarmont, Don Jenkin is the Devill himselfe, the Dog-dayes, The most incomprehensible whore-master, Twenty a night is nothing: Beggers, Broom-women, And those so miserable, they look like famine, Are all sweet Ladies in his drink. Con. He's a handsome Gentleman. Pitty he should be master of such follies. Land. Hee's ne're without a noise of Sirrenges In's pocket, those proclame him; birding pills, Waters to coole his conscience, in small Viols; With thousand such sufficient emblemes: the truth is, Whose chastity he chops upon, he cares not. He flies at all; Bastards upon my conscience, He has now in making multitudes; The last night He brought home one; I pitty her that bore it, But we are all weake vessels, some rich woman (For wise I dare not call her) was the mother, For it was hung with Jewels; the bearing cloath No lesse then Crimson Velvet. Con. How? Land. 'Tis true Lady. Con. Was it a Boy too? Land. A brave Boy; deliberation And judgement shewd in's getting, as I'le say for him, He's as well paced for that sportâ Con. May I see it? For there is a neighbour of mine, a Gentlewoman, Has had a late mischance, which willingly I would know further of; now if you please To be so curteous to me. Land. Ye shall see it: But what do ye thinke of these men now ye know 'em, And of the cause I told ye of? Be wise, Ye may repent too late else; I but tell ye For your owne good, and as you will find it Lady. Con. I am advis'd. Land. No more words then; do that, And instantly, I told ye of be ready: Don Iohn, I'le fit ye for your frumps, Con. I shall be: But shall I see this Child? Land. Within this halfe houre, Let's in, and there thinke better; she that's wise, Leapes at occasion first; the rest pay for it. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 4. Enter Petruchio, Don Iohn, and Fredrick. Iohn. Sir, he is worth your knowledg; and a Gentleman If I that so much love him, may commend him, Of free and vertuous parts; and one, if foule play Should fall upon us, for which feare I brought him, Will not flie backe for phillips. Pet. Ye much honour me, And once more I pronounce ye both mine. Fred. Stay, what Troope Is that below i'th valley there? Iohn. Hawking I take ir. Pet.

In what have I transgress'd it? Ye make a bold breach at the first Sir. Iohn. Bolder, You made that breach that let in infamy And ruine, to surprize a noble stocke. Duke. Be plaine Sir. Iohn. I will, and short; Ye have wrong'd a Gentleman Little behind your selfe, beyond all justice, Beyond mediation of all friends. Duke. The man, and manner of wrong? Iohn. Petruchio, The wrong, ye have whord his Sister. Duke. What's his will in't? Iohn. His will is to oppose you like a Gentleman, And single, to decide all. Duke. Now stay you Sir, And heare me with the like beliefe: this Gentleman His Sister that you named, 'tis true I have long loved, Nor was that love lascivious, as he makes it; As true, I have enjoy'd her: no lesse truth I have a child by her: But that she, or he, Or any of that family are tainted Suffer disgrace, or ruine, by my pleasures, I weare a Sword to satisfie the world no, And him in this cause when he please; for know Sir, She is my wife, contracted before Heaven, (Witnesse I owe more tye to, then her Brother) Nor will I flye from that name, which long since Had had the Churches approbation, But for his jealous danger.

You that have hung about my neck, and lick't me, I'le try how handsomely your Ladyship Can hang upon a Gallowes, there's your Master-piece; But harke ye Sirrah, no imagination Bawd ready above. Of where they should be? Ser. None Sir, yet we have search'd All places we suspected; I beleeve Sir, They have taken towards the Ports. Ant. Get me a conjurer, One that can raise a water devill, I'le port 'em; Play at duck and drake with my money? take heed Fidler; I'le dance ye by this hand, your Fidle-sticke I'le grease of a new fashion, for presuming To medle with my degamboys: get me a Conjurer. Enquire me out a man that lets out devils: None but my C. Cliffe serve your turne? Ser. I know notâ Ant. In every street, Tom foole, any bleare-eyd people With red heads, and flat noses can performe it; Thou shalt know 'em by their half gowns &amp; no breeches: Mount my mare Fidler? ha boy? up at first dash? Sit sure, I'le clap a nettle, and a smart one, Shall make your filly firck: I will find Fidler, I'le put you to your plundge boy: Sirrah meet me Some two houres hence at home; In the meane time Find out a conjurer and know his price, How he will let his devils by the day out, I'le have 'em, and they be above ground. Exit Ant. Ser. Now blesse me, What a mad man is this? I must do something To please his humour: such a man I'le aske for, And tell him where he is: but to come neare him, Or have any thing to do with his don devills, I thanke my feare, I dare not, nor I will not. Exit. ScÃ¦ne 3. Enter Duke, Petruchio, Fredrick, John, Peter, Servant with bottles. Fred. Whether wilt thou lead us? Pet. 'Tis hard by sir. And ten to one this wine goes thether. Duke. Forward. Petr.

'Tis so; that house sir Is it: out of that window certainly I saw my old Mistrisses face. Petr. They are merry indeed, Musicke. Harke I here Musicke too. Duke. Excellent Musick. John. Would I were ev'n among 'em and alone now, A pallat for the purpose in a corner, And good rich wine within me; what gay sport Could I make in an houre now? Song. Fred. Harke a voice too; Let's not stir yet by any meanes. John. Was this her owne voyce? Duke. Yes sure. Fred. 'Tis a rare one. Enter Bawd (above) Du. The Song confirmes her here too: for if ye marke it, It spake of liberty, and free enjoying The happy end of pleasure. Petr. Looke ye there sir, Do ye know that head? Fred. 'Tis my good Landlady, I find feare has done all this. John. Shee I sweare, And now do I know by the hanging of her hood, She is parcell drunke: shall we go in? Duke. Not yet Sir. Pet. No, let 'em take their pleasure, Duke. When it is highest, Musicke. Wee'll step in, and amaze 'em: peace more Musicke. John. This Musick murders me; what bloud have I now? Fred. I should know that face. Enter Fran. and Exit. John. By this light 'tis he Fredrick, That bred our first suspitions, the same fellow. Fred. He that we overtooke, and overheard too Discoursing of Constantia. John. Still the same; Now he slips in. Du. What's that? Fred. She must be here Sir: This is the very fellow, I told your Grace Enter Fran. We found upon the way; and what his talke was. Petr. Why, sure I know this fellow; yes, 'tis he, Francisco, Antonio's Boy, a rare Musitian, He taught my Sister on the Lute, and is ever (She loves his voice so well) about her: certaine, Without all doubt she is here: it must be so. John. Here? that's no question: what should our hen o'th game else Do here without her? if she be not here (I am so confident) let your Grace beleeve, We two are arrant Rascalls, and have abus'd ye. Fred. I say so too. John. Why there's the hood againe now, The guard that guides us; I know the fabricke of it. And know the old tree of that saddle yet, 'twas made of A hunting hood, observe it. Du. Who shall enter? Petr. I'le make one. John. I, another. Du. But so carry it, That all her joyes flow not together. John. If we told her, Your Grace would none of her? Du. By no meanes Signior, 'Twould turne her wild, starke frantick. Iohn. Or assur'd herâ Du. Nothing of that? starve nature? this ye may sir. That the conditions of our feare yet stand On nyce and dangerous knittings: or that a little I seeme to doubt the child. Iohn. Would I could draw her To hate your Grace with these things. Petr. Come let's enter, Exit. Pet. and Ioh. Musick. And now he sees me not, I'le search her soundly. Du. Now lucke of all sides. Fred. Doubt it not: more Musicke: Sure she has heard some comfort. Du. Yes, stand still sir. Fred. This is the maddest song. Du. Applyed for certaine Claping of a doore. To some strange mellancholly she is loden with. Fred. Now all the sport beginsâharke? Du. They are amongst 'em, The feares now, and the shakings? Trampling above. Fred.

Bring 'em downe, And you sir, follow me. Du. Hee's angry with 'em, I must not suffer this. Bowle downe the Bawd there Iohn within. Old Erra mater: you Lady leachery For the good will I beare to'th game, most tenderly Shall be lead out, and lash'd. Enter Petruchio, Iohn, Whore, and Bawd, with Francisco. Du. Is this Constantia? Why Gentlemen? what do you meane? is this she? Whore. I am Constantia sir. Du. A Whore ye are sir. Whore. 'Tis very true: I am a Whore indeed sir. Petr. She will not lye yet, though she steale. Whore. A plaine whore, If you please to imploy me. Du. And an impudentâ Whore. Plaine dealing now is impudence. One if you will sir, can shew ye as much sport In one halfe houre, and with as much variety, As a far wiser woman can in halfe a yeare: For there my way lies. Du. Is she not drunk too? Whore. A little guilded o're sir, Old sack, old sacke boyes. Petr. This is saliant. Iohn. A brave bold queane. Du. Is this your certainty? Do ye know the man ye wrong thus, Gentlemen? Is this the woman meant? Fred. No. Du. That your Landlady? Iohn. I know not what to say. Du. Am I a person To be your sport Gentlemen? Iohn. I do beleeve now certaine I am a knave; but how, or whenâ Du. What are you? Petr. Bawd to this peece of pye meat. Bawd. A poore Gentlewoman That lyes in Towne, about Law businesse, And't like your worships. Petr. You shall have Law, beleeve it. Bawd. I'le shew your mastership my case. Petr. By no meanes, I had rather see a Custard. Bawd. My dead husband Left it even thus sir. Iohn. Blesse mine eyes from blasting, I was never so frighted with a case. Bawd. And so sirâ Petr. Enough, put up good velvet head. Du. What are you two now, By your owne free confessions? Fred. What you shall thinke us, Though to my selfe I am certaine, and my life Shall make that good and perfect, or fall with it. Io. We are sure of nothing (Fred) that's the truth on't: I do not think my nam's Don John, nor dare not Beleeve any thing that concernes me, but my debts, Nor those in way of payment: things are so carried, What to entreat your Grace, or how to tell ye We are, or we are not, is past my cunning, But I would faine imagine we are honest, And o' my conscience, I should fight in'tâ Du. Thus then, For we may be all abus'd. Petr. 'Tis possible, For how should this concerne them? Du. Here let's partâ Untill to morrow this time: we to our way, To make this doubt out, and you to your way; Pawning our honours then to meet againe, When if she be not found. Fred. We stand engaged To answer any worthy way we are cald to. Du. We aske no more. Whore. Ye have done with us then? Petr. No Dame. Du. But is her name Constantia? Petr. Yes a moveable Belonging to a friend of mine: come out Fidler, What say you to this Lady; be not fearfull? Fran. Saving the reverence of my Masters pleasure, I say she is a whore, and that she has robb'd him, Hoping his hurts would kill him. Whore. Who provok't me? Nay sirrah squeak, Ile see your treble strings Ty'd up too; if I hang, Ile spoyle your piping, Your sweet face shall not save yee. Petr. Thou dam'd impudence, And thou dry'd devill; where's the Officer? Peter. Hee's here sir. Enter Officer. Petr. Lodge these safe till I send for 'em; Let none come to 'em, nor no noise be heard Of where they are, or why: away. John. By this hand A handsome whore: Now will I be arrested, And brought home to this officers: a stout whore, I love such stirring ware: pox o' this businesse, A man must haunt out morsells for another, And starve himself: a quick-ey'd whore, that's wild-fire, And makes the bloud dance through the veines like billowes. I will reprive this whore. Duke. Well, good luck with ye. Fred. As much attend your Grace. Petr. To morrow certaineâ John. If we out-live this night sir. Fred. Come Don John, We have something now to doe. Ioh. I am sure I would have. Fred. If she be not found, we must fight. Joh. I am glad on't, I have not fought a great while. Fred. If we dyeâ Jo.

Fred. He can compell 'em. John. With what? can he Tye squibs in their tailes, and fire the truth out? Or make 'em eate a bawling Puritan, Whose sanctified zeale shall rumble like an Earthquake? Fred. With Spels man? John. I with spoones as soone, dost thou thinke The devill such an Asse as people make him? Such a poore coxcomb? such a penny foot post?

And some sit here, I doubt not dare averre, Living he made that house a Theater Which he pleas'd to frequent; and thus much we Could not but pay to his loud memorie. For our selves we doe entreat that you would not Expect strange turnes, and windings in the Plot, Objects of State, and now and then a Rhime, To gall particular persons, with the time; Or that his towring Muse hath made her flight Nearer your apprehension then your fight: But if that sweet expressions, quick conceit, Familiar language, fashion'd to the weight Of such as speake it, have the power to raise Your grace to us, with Trophies to his praise: We may professe, presuming on his skill, If his Chances please not you, our fortune's ill.</field>
