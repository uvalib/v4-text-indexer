      <field name="fulltext">THE DVKES MISTRIS,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. So various are the pallates of our Age That nothing is presented on the Stage, Though nere so square, and apted to the Lawes Of poesy, that can winne full applause, This likes a story, that a cunning plot This wit, that lines, here one, he know's not what. But after all this looking severall wayes, We do obserue the generall guests to Playes, Meet in opinion of two straines: that please Satire, and wantonnes, the last of these Though old, if in new dressing it appeare Will move a smile from all, but shall not heare. Our Author hath no guilt of scurrile friends. For Satire they do know best what it meanes, That dare apply, and if a Poets Pen, Ayming at generall errors not the men, 'Tis not his fault, the safest cure is, they That purge their bosomes, may see any Play. But here we quit your feare of Satire too, And with these disadvantages to you Thus humbly bow, to such helpes tane away What hope is there many will like the Play, But good or bad, have patience but two howers, The Poets credit is at stake with ours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Enter Silvio, and Valerio. Si. Wee are like to have a brave, and jolly time on't. Va. The Court looks now as't should be, after such A tempest, what should follow but a calme, And Sun-beames? wher's the Dutchesse? And yet as the case stands, we can scarce give her That title, all her glory is eclips'd, Shee's i'th west, poore gentle-woman I can But pity her, I meane Euphemia. Sil. I dare not speake. Val. Thou mayst speake any thing That's Courtly, and in fashion. Sil. But the Duke. Val. Is Duke, and Heaven preserve him, let him have His humor, and his Mistresses, what are we The worse, nay lets consider like wise-men We are the better for't, it gives us liberty, And matter for our dutifull imitation. Sil. But she was his Dutchesse. Val. What then? Sil. A Lady of, A flowing sweetnes, and but in his eyes Can want no beauty, how her nature may Thus cruelly affronted, keepe that soft, And noble temperâ Val. Take heede, and be wise, We are or should be Courtiers, if it please The Duke for reasons best knowne to himselfe To have more Wives, I say 'tis fit he have 'em, I make it my owne case. Sil. Thou art not married. Val. No, I dare not for that reason, cause I hold it Unfit my conscience should be limited, But we are private men, and though the Lawes Have power on us, the State, and Dukedome may Suffer, if he that is the soule of all, I meane the Duke, should wast his life with one, One melancholy wife, come let me tell thee Since he has chosen one, that he thinks fayrer 'Tis happy for his first to keepe her head on, Sil. Coulst thou have thought so cruell, las Euphemia Val. No thou art deceiv'd, if I were Duke 'Tis ten to one I'de have noe Wife at all, Sil. How? Val. Not of mine owne, while any of my subjects Had those I could affect; whom I wo'd have Presented by their husbands, they should doe Themselves that curtesie, none would denie, Considering what may follow. Sil. Besides Hornes, Val. Right, if the toy be gamesome, the husbands made For ever. Sil. Cuckold. Val. And his Wife a great one, Hornes excuse for all. Sil. The old mind still. Val. I know my constitution Enter Leontio. His countenance weares some sore of discontent Do'es he not appeare Cloudy. Sil. Lett's speake to him. Val. My Lord,âmy Lord. Not answer. Sil. He does not heare. My noblest Lord. Val. If I did thinke he were proud now of a suddaine, I wod not aske him how he do'es, to save His lifeâI'le speake once more, my worthiest Lord, Leontio. Leo. Ha! Val. I ha waken'd him. Leo. Valerio, and Siluio. I am your servants. Val. Not that we grudge our duties to your Lordship Or breath, for without flattery, I dare Be hoarse with praysing, and with praying for you, But we would willingly have your Lordship take Notice, when we expresse our hearts to serve you. Leo. Your pardon gentlemen, I am confident You have more vertue then to let me suffer in your opinions Sil. You looke sad. Leo. Not I. Val. And talke as you had but started from a dreame, I dare not be too bold to enquire the cause. But your face will teach others melancholie. Sil. Now in this generall mirth it must appeare, The greater wonder to behold your trouble. Leo. I shall betray my selfe, keepe in my passions. Sil. Ther's something in't more then we apprehend. Val. What should distract the freedome of your sole Kinsman, and onely favourite to the Duke, The peoples love too, and these seldome meete, The minion of the Souldiers, who honour you Most infinitly for your valour, and your bounty. Leo. Flatter not gentlemen. Val. I'le be your hinde first. Ecclipse not, Sr, the glories of your minde with this strange melancholy, I wod not for My hopes the Duke should see this dulnes, he May with unhappy jealousie interpretâ Leo. What Jealousie? Val. I know not. Leo. Is my heart transparent? Val. Now ioy revels in the Court, By his command, and his example too; Doe not affront his pleasure, I am bold, But 'tis my zeale, that wo'd not have you suffer, And you may give it pardon. Leo. I must thanke Thy love Valerio, thy heart does speake A noble friendship, you shall witnesse Gentlemen I will be very pleasant, keepe, keepe in Yee rebell thoughts, and take some other time To shew your wildnes. Sil. Observ'd you that? Val. Shall I be bold to aske your Lordship a question? Leo. Any thing. Ual. You will pardon the folly on't? Leo. What is't? be cleare with me. Val. Are you not in love, my Lord? Leo. In Love? Val. I have shrewd coniectures. Leo. From what? Val. From these dull Symptomes, if you beâ Leo. What then? Ual. Let me be your Physition, 'tis a woman I must presume. Leo. What does a man love else? Val. There be those men are in love with their own cloathes Their wits, their follies, their estates, themselves, But if you love a woman, let me advise you. Sil. Heare him my Lord, his practise upon that sex Has made him learn'd. Val. Something I have oberv'd After a hundred Mistresses, I had beene dull else, But to the point. Leo. How would you advise mee? Val. I would not counsell you not to love at all, As some that are all Satyr, 'gainst the sex, Love me a hansome Lady, but so love her That still your heart finde roome for a fresh beautie, For twentie, for a thousand. Leo. Is inconstancie So easie, and so pardonable. Ual. Why dee' shift Your shirt, the linnen's fine, but not so cleane And sweete after a Journey, 'tis a Justice To change: and a security a woman Is Tyrant, when she finds a dotage, Love But wisely, to delight our hearts, not ruine 'em With too severe impression. Leo. Prethee tell me, What doe most men desire that are in love? Val. In this wise love I meane? why, my Lord, they Desire to enioy their Mistresses, what else Can be expected? and 'tis necessary In my opinion. Leo. Hadst thou beene woman, Thou wod'st not have beene so cruell. Val. Troth, my Lord, I know not how the sex might have corrupted mee. But had I beene Adonis, without question My Lady Venus should have had no cause To accuse my bashfullnesse, I should have left The Forrest to have huntedâ Leo. I beleeve it. Val. But I must be content. Sil. Nothing will much trouble thy head Ualerio. Val. I doe not vex my selfe with much inquirie What men doe in the Indies, or what Trade The great Turke's on, nor what his designe is, Nor does the State at home much trouble me, After the warres I enioy my limbs, and can Boast some activitie untill some woman In kindnesse take me downe, be rul'd by me. Employ your spring and youth upon those Joyes They are fit for, beget a new Elizium, Under some pleasing shade lets lie and laugh Our Temples crown'd with Roses, with the choyse, And richest blood of Grapes, quicken our veines, Some faire cheek'd boyes skinking our swelling Cups, And we with Joviall soules shooting them round At each mans lip a Mistresse. Sil. I did looke for this before. Val. They in this Bower Shall with their Songs, and Musicke charme our eares, And nimbly dance, their bright haire loosely spread; Nor shall they more their amorous beauties hide Then those contended for the golden Ball. Leo. Thou wod'st imagine many fine devices But after all these pleasures, as there is A limit, and a period set, what will Succeed these raptures, when they are past enjoyings But leave so many stings upon our thoughts. Val. We wo'not thinke of that, or if we do, Wee'le venture upon Fortunes curtesie. Leo. Thou art resolute Valerio, if ere sorrow Lay seige to me, i'le wish thee my companion. Val. I am your humble creature, and shall be honord In your commands. Enter Ascanio. As. My Lord, the Duke Ask'd for you. Ascanio whispers with Valerio, and Silvio. Leo. I'le attend. Whither in hast? Val. We are commanded to attend Ardelia. Sil. It is his pleasure, we should waite upon her To his presence. Leo. Ardelia, It will become you, and but that his highnes Exacts my person, I should be a part Exeunt. Of her attendance, but not serve her with Halfe the devotion, I would pay Euphemia The too much injur'd Dutchesse, now a stranger To the Dukes bosome, while another sits, And rules his heart, but this prepares my happines, My hopes grow from her misery, which may Encline Euphemia to pity me. I must use art. Enter Euphemia, and Macrina. La. Good Madam have more comfort. Leo. Is not that she? her habite like her Fortune Most blacke, and ominous, heer's a change of State, Noe noyse of waiters, and officious troopes, Of Courtiers flutter here, where are the traine Of Ladies, with more blossome then the Spring, Ambitious to present their duties to her, Where be those Jewells, whose proud blaze did use To vye with Sun-beames, and strike gazers blind? All gone behind a Cloud? how she observes The Structures, which more soft then Dionisio seeme to incline their marble heads, and sweate In the compassion of her iniury, My heart is labouring for breath, and yet I dare not speake to her, the Duke has spies Upon her, and his anger carries ruine. Enter Courtiers, who passe by neglectfully. Eup. Sure I should know this place. La. Tis the Court Madam. Eup. And those were Courtiers that past by? La. They were. Eup. Some of them serv'd me once, but now the Duke Has discharg'd all, why dost not thou forsake me. La. I serv'd you Madam, for your selfe, and cannot Thinke on you with lesse reverence, for your change Of Fortune. Eup. Is not that Leontio? La. It is Madam. Eup. Does he decline me too? though I am miserable, My griefe wo'd not infect him, but he must Compose himselfe to please, the Duke, whose creature He has beene alwayes. Leo. I will speake to her, Though death in the Dukes eye threatens to kill me, Great Mistresse. Eup. You doe not well Leontio to insult Upon my misery, Dionisios frowne May make your feild as barren. Leo. By all vertue, And by your selfe the Mistris, I have not One thought so irreligious in my soule I weepe for your misfortune, and shall Study All humble wayes to serve you. Eup. You have beene noble. Leo. Your titles are all sacred still with me, The Dukes neglect cannot unprince you here; Oh let not hasty sorrow boast a triumph Over so great a mind, let not that beauty Wither with apprehension of your wrong That may be soone repented, and the Storme That cowardly would shake that comliest building Make for your happines, some lament your fate. Enter Strozzi. Whose lookes speake mirth, be confident, the Duke Will chide the unlawfull flame, that like rude And wandring meteor, led him from your vertues With so much danger to embrace Ardelia. Str. The Duke shall know your complements. Exit. Eup. Noe more, least for your charity to me, For I must call it so, you ruine not Your favour with the Duke, farewell Leontio Yet I would pray one favour from you. Leo. Me? My life's your servant. Eup. If you heare the Duke Speake of me, as I feare he never will But in displeasure, tell him I will thinke it Noe cruelty to take this poore life from me, Rather then let me draw a wretched breath With generall scorne, let him command me dead, And I forgive him otherwise farewell. Exeunt. Leo. That close shew'd something, like a will to be Reveng'd, her brest heav'd up, and fell againe, While both her eyes shot a contention upward, As they would seeme to put just Heaven in mind How much she suffers. Enter Pallante. If griefe thus become her, What magicke will not love put on? I must Stifle my passion. Pallante, welcome, You are well met in Court; Where dost thou live Pallante? Pall. Every where, Yet no where to any purpose, we are out Of use, and like our Engines are laid by To gather dust, the Court I ha' not skill in, I want the tricke of flatterie, my Lord, I cannot bow to Scarlet, and Gold-lace, Embroiderie is not an Idoll for my worship, Give me the warres agen. Leo. But yet remember we fight for peace, The end of warre. Pall. I never did, my Lord. Leo. What? Pall. Fight for peace, I fought for pay, and honour, Peace will undoe us. Leo, Tis the corruption of our peace, that men Glorious in Spirit, and desert, are not Encourag'd. Pall. The faults somewhere. Leo. I presume Thou art not of so tyrannous a nature, But thou couldst be content to weare rich cloathes, Feed high, and want no fortune without venturing To buy them at the price of blood. Pall. I could. Leo. And ile engage thou sha't, be this the Prologue. Pall. Not I, keepe, keepe your money. Leo. You doe not scorne my bounty. Pall. You may guesse That fortune has not doted much upon mee, And yet I must refuse it. Leo. Your reason pray? Pall. Why ten to one I shall spend it. Leo. So tis meant. Pall. Twill make me gay a while, but I shall pawne My Robes, and put on these agen, Leo. Thou sha't not While I have Fortune to preserve thee otherwise, Pall. I say out of my love to you I must not, I never yet tooke money upon charity, I earn'd it in the Warre, and i'le deserue't In peace, of you I cannot, tis my misery To be unserviceable. Leo. Is that your Scruple? But that I know thy humor, I should thinke This cunning, but you shall not, Sr, despaire, I shall find wayes to have mention'd In your accounts for merrits, doubt not, I Will give you occasion to deserve more.

I never did Enioy it more then when I studied service, And duties to your grace. Du. Musicke, the minuits Are sad i'th absence of Ardelia, And moove too slow, quicken their pace with Luts, And voices. A Song. Du. No more; we will be Musicke of our selves, And spare your Arts, thought of Ardelia, Should strike a harmony through every heart, What brow lookes sad, when we command delight? We shall account that man a Traytor to us, That weares one sullen Cloud upon his face, I'le read his soule in't, and by our bright Mistresse, Then which the World containes noe richer beauty, Punish his daring sinne. Leo. He will deserve it Great Sir, that shall offend with the least sadnes, Or were it so possest, yet your command That stretches to the soule, would make it smile, And force a bravery, severe old age Shall lay aside his sullen gravity, And revell like a youth, the froward Matrons For this day, shall repent their yeares, and coldnes Of blood, and wish agen their tempting beauties To dance like wanton Lovers. Du. My Leontio, In this then thou dost present our bosome to thee, What's he? Leo. A Gentleman that has deserv'd For service in your late warres, Sir, a Captaine. Du. He may turne Courtier now, we have no use Of noyse, we can march here without a Drumme, I hope we are not in arreares to him, He haunts us for noe pay? Leo. Your bounty beside that, hath wonne their hearts. Du. Why has he noe better cloathes? this is a day Of Triumph. Pall. I beseech your highnes pardon, I ha' drunke your health in better cloathes, dispise My Christian Buffe! this is the fruits of peace, I'le waite on you agen. Exit. Du. Wher's my Ardelia? How at the name my spirits leape within me, And the amorous winds doe catch it from my lips To sweeten the Ayreâheaven at the sound Lookes cleare, and lovely, and the earth put's on A spring to welcome it, speake Leontio Strozzi, Gentlemen, but she appeares. Enter Ardelia, Valerio, Silvio. For whom the World shall weare eternall shine, Brightest Ardelia, Queene of love, and me, Ar. The onely honor, my ambition climes too, Is to be held your highnes humblest hand-maid. Du. Call me thy servant, what New charmes her lookes does throw upon my soule. Sil How the Duke gazes? Du. There is some strange divinity within her, Is there not Valerio? Val. I am not read so farre yet as divinity, Mine is but humane learning. Du. Speake agen, And at thy lipps the quires shall hang to learne New tunes, and the dull spheres but coldly imitate, I am transform'd with my excesse of rapture, Frowne, frowne Ardelia I shall forget I am mortall else, and when thou hast throwne downe Thy servant, with one smile exalt agen His heart to heaven, and with a kisse breath in me Another soule fit for thy love, but all My language is too could, and we wast time, Lead on, ther's something of more ceremony Expects our presence, Italy is barren Of what we wish to entertaine Ardelia.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Bentivolio, Horatio. Hor. Be counsell'd yet without being too ambitious To buy a deere repentance. Ben. Now we are Arriv'd at Court, shame to our resolution, I prethee do'nt tempt me to such cowardise, Horatio I must see her sheele not blast us, She was lovely when our eyes saluted last, And at my fare-well many innocent teares Wittness'd her sorrow, cleere as Aprill weepes Into the bosome of the Spring, not see Ardelia? Hor. You have travel'd since, and she Wanting noe beauty, was not over willing To languish in your absence, how I pity thee, But that I wod not too much vexe your folly, Do'st thinke ther's faith in any womans eyes, She wept at parting, a strong obligation When they can thread their teares, and make a chaine Of water, let me weare one o' their bracelets; I will convince thy madness in six words, Admit she said she lov'd you, and to your thinking Vow'd it, for you say you were contracted All this is nothing. Ben. No. Hor. Not this; although You had beene married, and i'th Sheets together, And chaffer'd earnest for a boy, 'tis nothing It binds not. Ben. How? Hor. Not with a thousand witnesses. Ben. How not bind her? Hor. Nor any woman living, that's possest With a wandring spirit, clap her in a dungeon, Pile three Castles on her, yet she shall Breake prison when she has but the least minde too't; She'le worke through a Steele-mine, to meete a friend That she likes better, with more ease throw up A quarrie of Marble, than a Mole shall dust, They worke with spirits, man, and can doe wonders, Especially a hansome woman, from whose false And sly temptations, all my wits defend me. There were some dealing with an Elvish female, That had but a course face, or say but halfe a one, Emnaticke eyes, with no more sight than could Distinguish well, man from a horse, or beare, To keepe her from mistake in procreation, A nose of many fashions, and as many Water-workes in 'em, lips of honest hide, And made to last, teeth of a Moores complexion, A chinne, without all controversie, good To goe a fishing with, a witches beard on't, With twentie other commendations, such a thing Were no mischiefe, and a man might trust Her with no scruple in his Conscience. Ben. This is plaine madnesse. Hor. You may call it so, But Ile be bound to travell further with This Night-mare, than the finest flesh and blood You court, and call your mistresse, why the Devill With all his art, and malice will nere cuckold me, And I should leave her in hell, and goe a iourney, I should be sure at my returne to find her Safe, and untouch'd, sound of her winde, and limbs; A faire, and hansome woman would not scape so: You have my opinion now, and 'twere lesse evill To practise it, you mind not my instructions. Ben. Not I. Hor. These Lectures have I read toth' City With the same successe, that Gentlemen might live honest, And men have lucke to father their owne children, But 'twill not be, you are resolv'd to try it? Ben. Am I engag'd thus farre to fall backe now? Hor. Remember where you are yet. Ben. I am i'th Court. Hor. Where you expect to complement with the Dukesâ Ben. What? Hor. What doe you thinke? the Dukes married, They say although he love Ardelia, And without question, in these parts may want No intelligence of your purpose and your person, And theres no doubt, but if he find you quaile-catching, He has power enough to coole your blood, and hers, Should she remember what has past betweene you, In that respect be caution'd, doe not worke A double ruine, to sooth one vaine humour; Eyes will beget an appetite of more neerenesse, And how that may succed, 'tis better feare, than prove. Ben. I prethee fright me not with shadowes. Hor. You are then for her substanceâile not leave you. Ben. Ile see her did the Duke proclaime it death. Hor. I Had rather see the Cow, with her five legges, And all the Monsters in the market, then Be troubled with the spectacle, but on, Stay, yet will you but see her? will her face content you, A farre off, without multiplying twinckles, Ridiculous sighes, or crost armes pinion'd thus, As the Kinght-Templers leggs are, whollie buried, Like Taylors, no djected lookes, as y'ad Your father alive agen to send you out To sea, with pention to maintaine you in bisket, Poore John, and halfe a livery, which should be Part of your governor, to read morrall vertue And lenton Lectures to you, or if she frowne As much as say my friend, J am not for you, The Dukes the better Gentleman, and shall pay for't Will you returne then with a handsome patience, And wisely love where no man els will rivall you, A Witch or some old woman, Ben. I prethee leave Thy phrenzy, thou shal't witnes ile be temperate. Enter Valerio. Who's this? Signior Valerio. Val. Bentivolio, welcome to Pavie, and the Court. Ben. My friend, Sir. Val. You both divide me. Ben. Then I am no stranger, In confidence of that friendship we both seal'd In Travell. Val. What affaires brought you to Pavie? Ben. Being at large, I had curiositie To observe what might improve my knowledge here With some taste of your Court. Val. And I am happie I have some power to serve your wish, nor could you Arrive to see it shine with more delight, It is compos'd of revells, now all ayre, Let me present you to the Duke. Ben. I shall be honour'd to kisse his hand. Val. Sha't see his Mistresse, The faire Ardelia, the Dukes no saint, I may tell thee. Hor. Pray Sir, with your favour, Cannot the Court furnish a Gentleman, And need be, with an uglie face or two, Such as would turne your stomacke, would content My fancie best. Val. What meanes your friend? Ben. A humour he playes withall. Ual. He would not play with such a woman, wo'd he? Hor. Yes, and if the place be not Too barren to afford me one ill-favoured Enough. Val. Nere feare it, they are common here As Crowes, and something of a hue by moone-shine; Promise to keepe your wits, and ile present you. Hor.

If it affect Your highnesse eare, dutie hath so compos'd My will to obedience, I must praise the musicke, And wish no other object to that sence, Unlesse you please to expresse more harmonie By some commands from your owne voice, that will Challenge my more religious attention. Du. What charme is in her language? cease all other (But discord to her accents) what a sweet, And winning soule she has, is it not pity She should be lesse than Dutchesse, farre above Euphemia in beautie, and rare softnesse Of nature, I could wonder, gaze for ever; But I expose my passion too much To censure, yet who dares dispute our will? Leontio looke upon Ardelia, And tell me. Leo. What Sir? Duk. Canst see nothing there? Leo. I see a spacious field of beautie Sir. Duk. Tis poore, and short of her perfection, Beare her this other Jewell, I will have her Shine like a volumne of bright constellations, Till all the world turne her Idolater: When did Euphemia looke thus? Leo. Never sir. Duk. Be Judge thy selfe Leontio, if my Dutches Lov'd me, could she denie her Dionisio This happinesse, but she has a stubborne soule, She has, and shall repent it. Leo. Sir, remember Shee is a princesse. Du. You were best remember her, Perhaps sheele take it kindlie. Leo. Sir, I hope You have more assurance of my faith to you Then to interpretâ Du.

Val. I shall. Du. Your countenance changes, I observ'd Your eyes upon that Stranger. Ar. He revewes The memory of a brother, I lov'd dearely, That died at Sea: I ne're saw two so like. Du. For representing one so neare Ardelia, Receive another welcome, and what favours Your thoughts can study from our Court, possesse 'em. Ben. You oblige my humblest servicesâhow now, how dost like this? Ho. Why scuruily, you flatter Your selfe into distruction, I see The Arrow will peirce thy heart, decline it yet. Ben. Still frantickely opposing. Ho. I ha' done Be mad, i'le give my braine to somewhat els, Sir, I wod see a phisnomy, though it looke As big as the fower winds, I ha' court-ship for it, And wo'not be blowne off with an Hericano, Yet trust me i'le be honest.

I come not Sir, with rudenes of my language, Or person to offend your mirth, although The nature of my sorrow is so wild It may infect weake minds, and such as have not Some proofe in their owne bosomes, but to make One, and my last suite, which when you have heard It may appeare so reasonable, and proportion'd To what your thoughts allow me, that you will Find easily a consent to make it fortunate, And me in the prevailing. Ardelia offers to depart. Du. Doe not moove Ardelia, I am full protection here. Eup. Ther's something sir in my request to make her happy too. Ard. I dare not heare the Dutchesse, Her lookes wound me. Du. Speake your promising wishes. Eup. Although I know not for what guilt in me Of more then my obedience, and some lesse Beauty then dwells upon Ardelias cheeke, You have exild me from your love, and bosome, And worse then one condemn'd by force of lawes, For sinne against your bed have sentenc'd me To wander with disgrace, carv'd in my brow The Fable of a Dutchesse, and your anger; My desires are you would have so much charity Though you have made me an out-law by your doome, Not to compell me after all my shames To be a murderer. Du. Treason, our Guard. Eup. You shall not trouble Sir your feares I bring the least blacke thought against your person, heaven Avert so foule a sinne, the danger all Doth threaten me, and my life, which I thus Most humbly beg may not be forc'd through blood By my owne hands: urgd by your heavy wrongs To such a desperate mutiny, which you may Prevent by your revenge of Law upon me. To which, and your displeasure I would yeild My life your welcome sacrifice, i'le praise Your mercy for my death, and blesse the stroake Devids my sad soule from me. Du. This your project? Leo. Did you heare the Dutches suite? Ard. Noe, but i'le beg It may be granted, doe not sir deny Your Dutches her desires so just, and reasonable; Leo. How's this? shee'le pray to be rid on her, Audacious woman Eup. Let me rise with horror. Du. Ardelia knowes not what Euphemia ask'd. Leo. She'le appeare cunning. Ard. I am confident She hath propounded nothing ill becoming. Leo. Nothing, a very trifle, wearied with Her injuries she onely begs the Duke Would be so kind to order with as much Conveniency as he please, her head to be Chop'd of, that all, and you were charitable To joyne so modestly in the advancement Of her desires. Ard. Defend it heaven, Madam your pardon, I imagin'd not You aym'd such cruelty upon your selfe. Eup. Proud, and dissembling woman, at such impudence I take my spirit to me, and no more Will put my breath to the expence of prayer To be short-liv'd, I will desire to live To see heaven drop downe justice, with such loud, And publicke noyse of my revenge on thee. And thy adulterate arts, as the world naming But once Ardelia, shall be palsey-strucke. I feele a new, and fiery soule within me, Apt to disperse my rage, which feare and my Religion would ha' stifled. Oh my fate! Du. She raves, to prison with her, we are not safe While she enjoyes the freedome of our ayre: Stay (my good Genius) she carries yet The title of our Dutches; tis our pleasure Leontio, she be your prisoner, But see her narrowlie confind, till we Determine what shall follow, in what we Limit, you not make your owne reason guide, But on your life secure her. Leo. Your commands In all things I obey, most blest occasion! Du. Foole, thou dost entertain what must undo thee, And make you both ripe for eternall absence; Hug Juno in the clouds, and court her smiles, Though she consent not, tis enough youl stand Suspected, aud expos'd to equall danger. You sha'not lose your ayre to plead for death, Thus wele secure Ardelia. Eup. I heare, And with all chearefullnesse resigne my will To imprisonment, or death; forgive the wildnesse, And furie of my language, I repent My wish upon Ardelia, may she live To doe so too, and you to be possest Of all joyes Earth and Heaven can blesse your heart with. May danger never in a dreame affright you, And if you thinke I live too long, tis possible, Before you send death to conclude my sufferings, Some thoughts of you may wither my poore heart, And make your path smooth, to what most you joy in Be not a tyrant when i'me dead, upon My fame, although you wish me not alive, Yet say I was Euphemia, let that sticke Upon my Tombe, if you will grace my shade With so much cost, in that name is supplied Enough to tell the world for whom I died. Du. We heare too much, away with her. Exeunt. Finis Actus Secunds.</field>

Ar. Love, your grace Knowes, never was compelld. Du. But love should find Compassion to the wound it makes, I bleed, And court thy gentle pity to my sufferings, All Princes are not of so calme a temper, Thinke of it my Ardelia, and reward The modest expectations of a heart, That in thy absence withers, but i'le have thee To chide thy cruell thoughts, and till our lipps Salute agen, flatter my selfe with hope Thy nature will be wise, and kind to love, Where tis so fairely courted.

I had no purpose they should be my guests At this time, th'are court Ladies, I confesse, Signior Valerio this was your plot. Ual. My pure intention, Madam, to doe you Service, I knew they were not for his pallate, These will inflame his appetite to you, And set you off, meere foiles to you doe they Looke as they were ambitious to be Compar'd with you. Fia. Noble sir, although I have not beautie like these Ladies. Ho. How? you ha' not beautie, take heed doe not shew Your selfe unthankfull to wise nature, do not They ha' not wealth enough in all their bodies To purchase such a nose. Mac. Ha, ha. Ho. Ha, ha, good Madam Kickshaw, That laugh to shew how many teeth you have. Val. Be not uncivill Sir. Ho. Why does that Fayrie grin then? I'le justifie there is more worth, and beautie, Consider'd wisely, and as it preserves Man in his wits, and sence, than can be read I'th volumne of their flattering Generations. Good Madam looke a squint, a little more, So, keepe but that cast with your eies, and tell me Whose sight is best, hers that can see at once More severall waies then there are points i'th Compasse, Or theirs that lookes but point-blancke. Mac. A new way To commend the eies. Ho. You thinke your fore-head pleases. Whose top with frizled, and curld haire beset, Appeares like a white cliffe, with reeds upon't; Your nose, which like an Isthmus parts two Seas. Aur. Seas? you meane eies agen. Ual. What of their nose? Ho. Will be in danger, with continuall beating Of waves, to wash the paint off, and in time May fall, and put you to the charge of building A silver bridge for praises to passe over. Mac. We'l barre your commendations. Ho. It sha' not need, I doe not melt my wits to verse upon Such subject, here's an instrument to smell with, Tough as an Elephants trunke, and will hold water. Val. It has a comely length, and is well studded With gems of price, the gold-smith wo'd bid money for't. Aur. Is he not mad? Ho. I can assure you no, And by this token I would rather be Condemn'd to'th Gallies, then be once in love With either of your phisnomies. Mac. Is't possible? Ho. You may put your whole faith upon't. Val. Dee' beleeve him? Madam. Aur. Methinkes this is the prettiest mirth, You have a mighty wit, could you be angry I love you for't. Mac. His humor takes me infinitely. Ho. It does, and you doe love me for't? Mac. Most strangely. Ho. I would you did, and heartily. Mac. What? Ho. Love me. Mac. So well, I could be happy in thy wife. Ho. Could Fate make me so miserable if I did not In lesse than a sennight breake thy heart, shu'dst Cuckold me at my owne perill. Val. This Lady has A mightie estate. Ho. Tis all the fault she has, Would she had none, had she no house, nor clothes, Nor meanes to feed, yet I would sooner marry, Observe, this naked salvage, then embrace The fairest woman of the earth, with power To make me Lord of Italy, I should alwayes Enjoy my health. Val. Her very face would keepe Your bodie soluble. Ho. No feares compell me To be a prisoner to my dining-roome, I might hawke, hunt, and travell to both Indies. Aur. Give any Doctor leave to give her Phisicke. Mac. Or change of Ayre. Val. Save much in your owne diet, Which else would call for Amber-greece, and rootes, And stirring cullices. Aur. You might allow her To visit Maskes and Playes. Ual. And the Bordellos, I thinke she would be honest. Ho. And thats more Then any Christian conscience dare assure By oath on your behalfeâto be short Ladies, Howe're you may interpret it my humour, Mine's a Platonicke love, give me the soule, I care not what course flesh, and blood in shrine it; Preserve your beauties, this will feare no blasting: I beg you call me servant. Aur. Did you heare him? Fia. You must acknowledge then I am your Mistresse. Ho. Ile weare your Perriwig for my Plume, and boast More honour int, than to be minion To all the Ladies of the Court, deere Mistresse If you can love a man, jeere 'em a little. Fia. Faire Ladies will you in, and taste a banquet, Be not discountenanc'd that this Gentleman Is merrie with your beauties, the Spring lasts Not all the yeare, when nature that commands Our regiment will say, faces about, We may bee in fashion, no controwling destiny. Passion, who curld your haire? here wanteth powder, Who is your Mercer, Madam? J would know What your cheeke stands you in a weeke in Taffata? Your face at distance shewes like spotted Ermine. Ho. Or like a dish of white-broth strew'd with Curtains. Fia. Right servant, that was a more proper simily, Discretion should ha put more ceruse here, Your fucus was ill made, d'ee you not lie In a maske all night, Madam. Va. Thou dost in a vizard I will be sworne how the rude Gipsie triumphs. Ho. Enough, they now begin to swell, and sweate, Let's leave 'em. Exeunt. Va. What a Hecate was this? Will you not be reveng'd? Aur. Yes, if we knew By what convenient stratagem. Va. I have it, There is another creature of my acquaintance, If you have faith more monstrous then this beldam, I will possesse her with this gentlemans humor, And skrew her up to be this witches rivall, what thinke you of that? Au. Will it not make her mad? Ma. I wo'd goe a pilgrimage to see't, 'twill be A mirth beyond the Beares. Au. Loose no time then. Val. I'le fit him with a female fury, such As the Divell with a pitch-forke will not touch. Come Madam. Exit. Enter Leontio, Euphemia. Leo. Have comfort Madam, I prophecy your sufferings are short-liv'd. Eup. You meane I shall die shortly. Leo. We shall find Lesse want of all the Starres, the aged World May spare their light, while 'tis possest of yours, Which once extinguish'd, let those golden fires Quite burne themselves to ashes, in whose heape Day may be lost, and frighted heaven weare blacke Before the generall doome, have bolder thoughts, And bid us all live in your onely safety. Eup. Let not your fancy mocke the lost Euphemia? Leo. Let not the apprehension of your sorrow Destroy your hope, should the Duke never wake His sences steep'd in his adulterate lethargy, You cannot want protection, nor your will To be reveng'd, an arme to punish his Contempt of so much beauty. Eup. How my Lord? Leo. What Scithian can behold an outrage done Upon these eyes, and not melt his rough nature In soft compassion to attend your teares? Eup. My Lord I know not with what words to thanke Your feeling of my sufferings. I will now Beleeve I am not lost to all the World; You are noble, and I must be confident These streames flow from your charity. Leo. Doe not injure The unvalued wealth of your owne honour Madam, Let poore deserts be worth our charity, All sacrifice of greife for you is Justice, And duty to the Alter of your merrit, These drops are pale, and poorely speake my heart, Which should dissolve into a purple flood, And drowne this little Iland in your service, Name some imployment that you may beleeve With what true soule I honour you, oh Madam If you could read the Volume of my heart, You would find such a story of you there. Eup. Of me? Leo. Tis that keepes me alive, I have noe use Of memory, or reason, but in both To exercise devotion to your excellence. Eup. My Lord I understand you not. Leo. You are More apprehensive if you wod but thinke so, In vaine I still suppresse my darke thoughts Madam, Which in their mutiny to be reveal'd Have left a heape of ruines worth your pity. Oh doe not hide that beauty should repaire What my love to it hath decay'd within me, For I must say I love, although you kill My ambition with a frowne, and with one angry Lightning, shot from your eye, turne me to ashes. Eup. Good heaven! Leo. I know what you will urge against me, You shannot need to arme your passion, I will accuse my selfe, how much I have Forgot the distance of one place beneath you, And wounded my obedience, that I am False to the Duke, the trust impos'd upon me, And to his favor which have made me shine A Starre, on whom the other emulous lights Looke pale, and wast their envies, I confesse I have not in the stocke of my desert Enough to call one beauteous smile upon me, My whole life is not worth your liberall patience, Of one, one minute spent in prayer to serue it, Yet after all wish'd destiny commands The poore Leontio to love Euphemia. Eup. What doe I heare? consider sir, againe. Le. I have had contentions with my blood, &amp; forc'd Nature retire, and tremble with the guilt Of her proud thoughts, seeking to make escape Through some ungentle breach made by our conflict, But noe prevailing against love, and fate, Which both decree, me lost without your mercie. Oh bid me live, who but in your acceptance Shall grone away my breath, and whither till I turne my owne sad monument. Eup. Noe more, Ist possible new miseries should oretake Euphemia? Oh my Lord! with what offence Have I deserv'd, after my weight of sorrow, Your wounds upon my honour? call agen Your noble thoughts, and let me not reply To your vnjust desires, if I must answer them, Take my most fixt resolve, er'e I consent To wrong Dionisio. Leo. Stay. Eup. May I be blasted, Though with contempt he looke upon me now, His blood may cleare, and he returne to challenge Euphemias piety, our vow was made For life my Lord, and heaven shall sooner fall, And mixing with the elements make new Chaos, Then all mans violence, and wrath upon me Betray one thought to breake it. Leo. Loose not all Your peace at once, vouchsafe I may waite on you. Eup. I know my prison. Leo. Let me hope in this, Enter Pallante. My pardon seal'd Pallante? Pall. My good Lord. Leo. Your humble creature Madam, though the Duke Confine your person, thinke upon your prisoner. Exeunt Euphemia, and Pall. Our vow was made for life, 'twas so how swift An apprehension love has? but hee's Duke; Conscience be waking, I shall lanch into A Sea of blood els, steere my desperate soule Diviner goodnes. Enter Pallante agen. How I start at shaddowes? Love take me to thy charmes, and prosper me Pallante thou art faithfull. Pall. To you my Lord, May I be ever els condemn'd to an Hospitall. Leo. And darst assist to make me happy. Pall. Yes, Though with the hazard of my throat-cutting, I hope Sir, you suspect not, name an action Though it looke nere so gastly, see how much I'le tremble at it. Leo. In thy eare. Pall. Once moreâ Tough service i'th beginning, may I not thinke on't? Leo. Yes. Pall. And aske my selfe a question ere I answere. Leo. You may. Pal. At first dash kill the Duke, no lesse To begin withall, how now Leontio? Was there no other life but this, for saving Of mine so often? he has trusted me, To whom shall I turne traitor? pray my Lord, Are you in earnest? would you have this done? Leo. Aske one, whom tyrannie hath chain'd to'th oare, For ever forfeited to slaverie, Whether he would not file off his owne bondage, And in the blood of him that ownes the Gally Swimme to his freedome. Pall. Doe you apprehend it So necessary? why ile doe my poore endeavour, Nay, tis but modest, if't concerne your Lordship In that degree, ile doo't, you will have some Convenient care of me, when tis dispatchd, He scorn'd my valiant Buffe, I thought upon't, You are the next in blood, when Dionisio Visits the wormes. Leo. Thou giv'st me a new life, With the same care ile cherish thee Pallante. Pall. And you doe not, It is not the first conscience hath been cast Away in a great mans service, cheere your heart Sir. Leo. It is not mine Pallante, I have lost The use, and sway, tis to anothers growne, And I have but the ruines of my owne. Exeunt. Finis Actus tertii.</field>

So, so, now let's releeve our lungs a while, They'l tire, I nere met with such a dancing Divell, My Destinies take me to your charge, 'twill give Us breath, if the Musitians exercise Their voice upon the song I made, come sit. Fia. You shall command me servant, now, the song. Song. Enter Servant. Ser. The Lady Aurelia, Madam, and Macrina Are come agen to visit you. Fia. I am not In tune for their discourse say, I am busie. Ho. By no meanes, she has a plot upon me. Fia. Then ile meet em. Ho. Do not feare but I am fortified; Here were a purchase now, and pension with A Mistresse, many a proper mans profession, Nature meant she should pay for't, and maintaine A man in fidlers, fooles, and running-horses, Here were no feare of any Lords returne From Tennis, no suspition at home, To force her to a politicke pilgrimage To trie the vertue of some well, no kinsmen, With lookes to keepe the flesh in awe, no children To cry, and fright the house, their mothers smother'd. Enter Fiametta, Aurelia, Macrina. They are here. Mac. I wonder at Valerios stay. Aur. He wo'not be long absent, never feare madam. Ho. Ladies, I have no power to bid you welcome, Or if I had you wod scarce thanke me for't, You know my mind already. Enter Scolopendra led by Valerio. Aur. See hee's come, And his Beare with him. Val. Signior, You see what care I have to provide for you, There is not such another dapple-mare i'th Dukedome, Unlesse this face content you, you may stay Till the Cretan Lady goe to Bull againe, Or Africke have more choice of Monsters for you. Ho. I am ravish'd. Fia. How's that servant, ha? a rivall. Ho. Pray whats her name? Val. Her name is Scolopendra. Ho. Scolopendra? I have read of her, what kinne is she To the Serpent with a hundred legges? Val. I know not But she is Cosen-germane to the Salamander She was a Cooke-maide once, so inur'd to fire, And tough, the flames of hell will hardly scortch her. Ho. An admirable Dragon, can she speake? Will she not spit fire if I should salute her? Ile venter. Val. He has preservative Against the odor of her lungs. Aur. He had need Of fortification for his eyes. Ho. Not all The spices in Arabia are like Her breath. Val. Oh Sir, beleev't, right Stix, most pure Avernus. Sco. Sir, J did never see a Gentleman Whom I did wish more heartily my husband. Val. To beget Scorpions on her. Ho. Thanke thee my pretious Scolopendra, but I have a kind of feare thou wot be unconstant, Shall noe man get thee from me, here's a face Is worth my jealousie, and who lookes upon't, But with my eyes will be as mad as I am. Sco. The needles not more constant to the North. Ho. But for all that, the needles wavering I would be certaine. Fia. They conspir'd to wrong me, I feare hee's taken with her more deformity, Will you forsake me servant? Ho. Hum stand off, And give my eyes play further yet, your shadowes Are yet to neareâmy judgment is confounded, Consider one thing with another, they are both Such matchles toads, I know not which to choose: You have an excellent eye, but there's a pearle In hers, noe Gold-smith knowes the value on't. Fia. Observe the colours in my eye. Ho. Y'are right Madam, As many, and more bright then those i'th raine-bow Delightfull as the Parrats plume, but then Her for-headâ Va. So like a promontory orâ Ho. A Feild of Hony-suckles, and Poppy-flowers Embroder'd with Dazies, and emboss'd With Yellow-warts which like to Mole-hills swell, Va. Where many Emmets hunt, and sport themselves I'th Sunne, till to her haire a quickset hedge I'th evening they retire. Ho. But twixt her eyes You may discerne a Forrest, some higher timber Is so well growne, that fashion'd on the top With scissers, and cut poynted like a pyramide, The World will take her for an Unicorne. Aur. Good beetle-browes. Sco. Sir, you must be my champion. Va. Examine but this nose. Sco. I have a toter. Va. Which plac'd with symmetry is like a Fountaine I'th middle of her faceâdistilling Rhewme, And at two spouts doth water all her Garden. Ho. But here's one soft as 'twere compos'd of wax. Aur. A nose of wax. Mac. It will melt presently. Ho. Not stubborne, but submits to any shape, Sheele put upon't round, flat when she is pleas'd She can extend, and hang it with such art Over her mouth, that when she gapes into The Sunne, and shewes her Teeth, you will imagine You see a perfect Dyall in her Chaps, To tell you what a clocke tis, then her Lips. Va. I see not so much red there, as will make A Dominicall Letter, looke upon these Cheekesâ Sco. I never painted, Sir. Va. Here's red enough. Ho. Which hideously dispos'd, and mixt with blacke, The ground of her complexion will mortefie The most unnaturall concupiscence, While her cheekes represent in curious Land-schape. Gomorrah, and her sister Sodome burning. Va. That comparison was home. Ho. But she has a breath, A more preservative then Methridate Va. But with one kisse she will preserve you from The infection, and with stronger force repell The poyson of the Ayre. Sco. I thanke you sir, I have a strong breath indeed Va. When she is moov'd Sheele kill you with her phlegme, fowerscore point blancke, The innocent part of it will staine a Marble, Let me alone to commend thee. Fia. She carries not destruction like my tongue Employd upon thy enemies Horatio. The Bells rung backwards, or the Mandrakes cry, Wolves howling at the Moone, the Scritch-owles dirge, The Hiens voice, the groanes of parting soules, Added to these, what is in nature killing, To the eare is not more fatall then my tongue When it is bent on mischeife, shall I blast This Witch to begin withall? Sco. Blast me? Va. Belch back-wards, And then shee's a dead woman. Sco. I'le teare your Snakes. Fia. Mine Hecate. Va. Well said Scolopendra. Ho. They wonot skirmish. Va. The Divells will runne at tilt. Au. Madam suffer this? Fia. Compare with me? Va. Sa, sa, sa, now sound a point of Warre. Enter a servant. Ser. Madam the Duke. Ua.

We trusted to your art about Ardelia, She makes noe hast to our delight. Fia. And please Your highnes I have had a strange hand with her, And I must tell you she was prety comming Untill the stranger came. Du. What stranger. Fia. Signior Bentivolio Nay I know nothing by 'em, but he has A most prevailing tongue upon a gentle-woman. Du. My feares! have I advanc'd him to supplant me? Va. Bentivolio so gracious with the Duke? Sil. Hee's courted next Ardelia. Asc. Tis for her We may imagine the Duke graces him. Ua. Oh there is noe such instrument, beleeve it As a Court-Lady to advance a gentleman, Or any masculine busines, they are Sticklers Enter Bentivolio. Du. No more. Signior Bentivolio. Fia. Where's Horatio. Va. He was afraid you might kill one another, And so hee's gon to hang himselfe. Fia. Better all Thy generation were executed, but I must to my charge Ben. Your highnes powers Such infinite graces on me I shall want Life to expresse my pious duties, though Time should assure me ages. Du. Thanke Ardelia, Or if you would expresse your gratitude To me. employ your wit, and tongue, to gaine That Lady to our close embrace, you have A powerfull language, be it your first-service We doe not place this confidence on all. Ben. You meane Ardelia. Enter Strozzi. Du. That faire one, Strozzi. Ua. Well Signior Bentivolio, my quondam Friend, and fellow traveller, you owe To me a part of your Court exaltation, And least you should forget, as few great men Are guilty of good memories, I meane To pay my selfe. Ben. I must not appeare troubled. Va. I congratulate your favor with the Duke, And thinke it, not the least of my owne happines That I was a poore instrumentâ Ben. You honour'd me, And shall command my services: how sped My friend Horatio? Va. He gave me thankes I ha fitted him, you mist excellent sport. Ben. I shall have time to enquire, and thanke you for The Storie, you know how to excuse me friend, If some engagements force me hence? Exit. Va. Why so. He has the tricke already, full of busines, Court agitations, he is yet scarce warme, How will he use us when his pride boyles over? A nod will be a grace, while we stand bare, And thanke him for the rufting of his countenance, And discomposing his Court face, that's bound Upon some State affaires, tis very well. Du. Give him accesse, thou hast shew'd diligence, And trust me to reward it. Str. Tis my duty sir. Exit Strozzi. Va. I have some intelligence wil be worth your hearing too. Du. Speake Signior Valerio. Ua. Doe you know the gentleman Whom you have grac'd so lately. Du. Signior Bentivolio. Va. That's his name, but doe you know his nature? Or his busines in these parts. Du. Prethee instruct me. Va. You doe but warme a Serpent in your bosome, In short he loves your Mistres. Du. Ho's? Va. More is contracted, And they both practise cunning, I ha' search'd His heartâyour eareâ Sil.

To me Noble Valerio, be confident For your owne worth, if any power of mine Can serve your wish, you shall not finde me slow To exercise it. Val. Yes, tis in your power. Ard. Presume tis finishd then. Val. In your free power, Without the Duke, or other to confirme it. Y'are flesh, and blood. Ard. What meane you? Val. No other than I say, nor wish it other, A woman is a partner in the frailty Of humane nature, and knowes how to excuse The errors of our blood, and yet you shall Have cause to give me thanks, when you consider My sence, and your owne state, what dee' thinke Of me? Ard. For what? Val. For what you please to call it, My persons not contemptible, though I be No Duke, I can behave my selfe to please Where I am accepted. Ard. Whats your purpose Signior? Val. You cannot sure be ignorant of my meaning, Theres not a girle of seaven yeares old, but will Expound it readily, here we sucke this language And our milke together, I could have us'd More circumstance, have prais'd you into folly, And when I had put out both your eies with Metaphors, Lead you to my desires, and to your pillow: But 'twas about, I could have said I lov'd you, Lookd sad, and squeez'd my eies, have sigh'd perhaps, And sworne my selfe quite over breath, that I Thought you a Saint, and my heart suffer'd more Than the ten persecutions; hang't, time's precious, I take the neerest way, which your discretion Will like me for, yet I can love you too, And would for thy embrace forget asmuch Goodnesse, and tempt as many mischiefes as, Another man, I hope you understand me. Ard. I am lost, and see a blacke conspiracie. Val. You shall see me naked. I ha' no conspiracies, Carrie no private engines more then nature Arm'd me withall, be wise and doe not tremble. Ar. How dare you be thus insolent? though my person Move you to no regard, you shall finde one Will teach you manners. Val. You would meane the Duke now. Ar. Has that name no more reverence owing to it? Ual. Yes, I desire no better judge, he'l heare Us both, and equally determine all; Let's to his highnesse streight. Ar. What meanes this rudenesse? Ua. You are the Dukes game-royall, or els should Be the mistris of his thoughts, whose nod does make Us tremble, and in time may be the Dutchesse, Unles your sweete heart Bentivolio Snap you before him. Ar. Ha? Va. What fine netts you walke in, You are noe Iugler, there has past noe contract Betwixt you, and the gallant, no? and while, The honest easie Duke, whose spirit raise not, Doates on that face, humbled beneath a subject, You have noe private meetings, change no kisses, Nor hot carreers, alas hee's but a Stranger Whom you respect but for the bare resemblance Of a dead brother, there's noe fame in you But what lights you to charity; I wast breath, The Duke is yet that tame thing, you ha' left him, His soule in a dreame, let not your folly, And peevish opposition to receive Me to your armes, wake him into a tempest, The lightning cannot moove more nimbly, then His rage to both your deaths, your Ganimede Will find the Dukes revenge in his hot blood, When his heart weeping the last drope shall have Noe pity waite upon 'em, that durst feed The rivall to a Prince, though common men For want of power, and courage to revenge Neglect their shame, wild Princes that know all things, Beneath their feete but heaven, obey noe fate, And but to be reveng'd will hazard that. Ar. I am undone for ever. Va. Not so Madam, You shall lead destiny in cords of Silke, And it shall follow tame, and to your pleasure, The Duke knowes nothing yet, you shall seale up My lip to eternall silence of your love, If I may but injoy you, you shall rule With the same sway his bosome, and possesse Your wealth in Bentivolio too, I'me but A friend or rather servant, that shall be Proud of your smile, and now, and then admitted To kisse you when the Curtaines drawne, and so forth. Ar. Who plac'd me on this precipice? sir, heare me, Tis vaine to aske how you deriv'd the knowledge Of what I thought conceal'd, you are a gentleman. Va. That does appeare by my desires. Ar. Have yet some mercy On a distressed maid. Va. Maid? thanke you for that, I wo'd you were Indeed, virginity is wiser then Men take it for, and therefore we distinguish, There is one virginity in the wedge, or bullion As we may say, and this we call lunor maiden-head, And there's another in the coine, the gold Is not lesse gold for the impression, Your maiden-head is currant in this sence. And in this maiden-sence you may give Milke. Ar. By all the goodnes that I wish were in you, Not Bentivolio, whom you thinke I most Affect, hath more of me then virgin knowledge, Not hath the Duke with all his flatteries Wrong'd my first State, although I must confesse He every day expects my fall from vertue, Doe not you more sir, then the divell could, Taking advantage of my wretched fortune, Betray me to a shame will kill us both, In fame, and soule. Va. In fame? who shall reveale it? And tother may repeat. Ar. Sir, can you kill me? Va. No, no I sha'not hurt thee, women are not kil'd That way, I meane to skirmish, come you may Save all with little study, and lesse hazard. What is the toy we talke of? eyther resolve Or the Duke knowes all, and perhaps more. Ar. Stay sir. Va. Yes, yes Madam I can stay, and be till To morrow for the sport, I am not so hot But I can bath, and coole my selfe. Ar. Can you Be just hereafter if to buy my owne, And my friends safety at so deare a value. Va. I'le cut my tongue out e're reveale my tongue, All my concupiscence, and the cause, I will Submit to thy owne carving; feare not me, I hate a blab worse then an honest woman, Why so? this wisdome is becoming thee, Noe blubbering, kisse me, and be confident, A prety rogue, to morrow shall we meete? Ar. Woe is me to morrow. Va. No, thou shalt laugh to morrow, I'le come to thy owne lodgings, that's but reason, Far-well, another kisse, be comforted, And safe, the Duke knowes nothing, all shall live, And wee'le be very loving, mighty merry. Ar. I must doe something to prevent this Divell. Exit Ardelia. Va. Why so, this bargaine was well made, and timely. Enter Leonato. Leo. I have noe peace within me, till I heare How bould Pallante thrives, oh love upon What desperate actions dost thou engage us? With scorne of opposition, like a fire Which till it turne all that his flame can meete with Into it selfe, expires not; faire Euphemia! Bright in thy sorrowes, on whom every teare Sits like a wealthy Diamond, and inherits A Starry lustre from the eye that shed it, The Duke must dieâhave I betray'd my selfe. Va. Hold, my Lord you know me. Leo. For Valerio. But must hand-backe that secret, 'twas not ment So early for thy knowledge, from thy bosome I'le teare or drowne it in thy blood, past search Of dangerous intelligence. Va. Hold my Lord, You shall not neede, Thinke my Lord I know The World, and how to keepe a secret too, Though treason be contain'd in't, I am not So holy as you take me, my good Lord For some ends of my owne, I wish the Duke In another VVorld as heartely as your Lordship, And will assist to his conveyance thither, Though I be quarter'd for't, that's faire, and friendly, You love Euphemia, why tis not amisse, I love Ardelia, (I trust you my Lord) You for the wife, I for the concubine, How could the Duke being in heaven, hurt me now? You are his kinsman, were his favourite. Leo. How's that? Va. Oh sir, there is a gentleman my rivall, One Bentivolio got a round above you In favourâ Leo. He shall die. Va.

Ben. I am bound Much to his goodnes. Leo. Sir I would doe more Then pity your just cause. Va. Nay we ha' cast it, And so much above blood, and state, has vertue Impression in his heart, he can forget, And thinke the Duke a dead man. Ben. Excellent Lord! Leo.

Leo. Twere pity thou shouldst suffer more. Ben. But dare Your Lordship meane this. Leo. Be confirm'd. Ben. Your counsells Have met a spirit, apt in my revenge To flie upon the world, I hope I shall Be constru'd in his death, to have done your Lordship Noe great discourtesie, being next heire, Va. Tis to be understood. Leo. The Dukedome made Mine by his death, is nothing to the Crowne Of faire Ardelias love, in whose free bosome My pardon, and best wishes shall soone plant thee Past the divorce of tirants. Ben. I am new Create, and build my hopes upon your honour. Exit. Leo. They are secur'd dost thinke hee's firme, and daring. Va.

I can be wicked upon good occasion, The divell sha'not part us now. Leo. Be constant, And meete the truest friend, Va. Meete at a wench Till then your humble servant. Leo.

I am caught in my owne toyles, by the same Engine I rais'd to the Dukes death, I fall my selfe, The mistery of fate, I am rewarded, And that which was the ranke part of my life, My blood, is met withall, and tis my wonder My veines should run so cleere a red, wherein so much blacke sinne was wont to bath it selfe, I wo'd looke up, and beg with my best strength Of voyce, and heart forgivenes, but heaven's just, Thus death payes treason, and blood quencheth lust. Moritur Enter Leontio, melancholy. Some cry treason within. Leo. Although I love, and wish the act of treason The noise yet comes to neare me. Enter Strozzi. Str. Oh my Lord! The Duke is kil'd. Leo. The Duke! by what blacke murderer? Str. That gives the State another wound, we cannot Suspect who was the traytor, to revenge it, But whosoever was guilty of this paracide, Is still within the Court, the deeds so fresh He cannot be farre off. Leo. Shut up the gates, And plant a strong guard round about the pallace, Let none goe forth in paine of death, the divell Sha'not obscure him here with his blacke wings, Though her rob Hell to cover us with darknes, Wee'le find him under twenty foggs, and drag him To his just torment. Str. Y'are his pious successor. Exit. Leo. Tis done, and my ambition's satisfied, Containe my heart, but to which bold assassivate Pallante or Bentivolio must I owe This bloody service. Enter Pallante Pall. I ha' don't my Lord. Leo. Softly, thou art my brave, and glorious villaine. Pall. There have beene better titles sir, bestow'd On men of my desert, the killing of My lawfull Prince, hath beene esteem'd an act 'Bove the reward of villaine, though I know I am one, and a monstrous villaine too, I wo'd not be cal'd so. Leo. Thou sha't devide Titles with me, dost thinke i'le not reward it? Thou art sad. Pall. I am a litle melancholy After my worke. Leo. Dost thou repent thy service? Pall. Were he alive, i'de kill him agen for you. Tis not his death that hants my conscience, But the condition, and State he died in, That troubles me. Leo. What State, or what condition? Pall. When I had taught him to beleeve he was not Long liv'd, and that your Lordship had by me. Sent him a writ of ease, for i'le make short. Leo. Didst thou discover me? Pall. Why not? I was To take an order he should n'ere reveale it, Upon the mention of your name my Lord. He fetch'd a sigh, I thought would have prevented My execution on his heart, as if That were a greater wound then death upon him, But I, whose resolute soule was deafe to his prayer, Bath'd in as many teares, as would have wrought A Marble to compassion, bid him choose The humor he would die in, and collect Some thoughts to waite upon him to eternity, And what doe you thinke he made his choice? Leo. I know not. Pall. To die an honest man, no wish to part The world with faire Ardelia in his armes, and give his ghost up in a wanton kisse. But with a thousand groanes, calling upon Euphemia to forgive him, to whose vertue His soule was going forth, to meete, and seale To it, a new, and everlasting marriage, Nay he had so much charity to forgive You sir, and me, and would have pray'd for us, But that I sent the message to his bosome That made him quiet, and so left his highnes Had he died obstinate in his sinnes, the wanton Lascivious Duke he liv'd, I wo'd not blush for't. Leo. Why, dost relent for this? Pall. I find some mutiny In my conscience, pray my Lord tell me Do not you wish it were undone. Leo. Thou hast The tremblings of an infant, it exalts My thoughts to another heaven, Pallante thou Must not leave here, but make Leontio owe His perfect blessing to thy act, goe to Euphemia, and with thy best art drop This newes into her eare. Within. Away with 'em. Leo. What tumults that? Enter Bentivolio, and Ardelia with officers Off. My Lord we have found the traytor He does confesse he kil'd the Duke. Pall. Howes that? Leo. He kil'd the Duke? tis Bentivolio. Ben. I did my Lord, you shannot trouble much Examination, with this hand I sacrific'd Ferneze, and you ought to call my act Pious, and thanke me for removing such A tyrant, whose perfidious breath had heaven Beene longer patient wo'd have blasted Parma. Leo. And in the confidence of this service done, You present your selfe to be rewarded. Ben. I meant not to have troubled you for that Had not their force compeld us backe. Leo. Come neerer. Ar. I wonder at this noyse of the Dukes death, Valerios tragedy is all that we Are guilty of, which yet I have conceal'd From Bentivolio. Leo. Had you no ayde To this great execution, did you doo't alone? Ben. Alone, and tis my glory that Noe hand can boast his fatall wound but mine, And if you dare be just my Lord. Leo. Be confident, There is some mistery in this Pallante Both could not kill the Duke, he does accuse, himselfe. Pall. I am all wonder my good Lord. Leo. You are sure tis done. Ben. Now you dishonor me, Dee know blood royall, when you see't, you may Beleeve that crimson evidence, I hope Your Lordship will remember. Leo. Feare it not, But for a time you must be prisoner To satisfie a litle forme upon My life, no danger shall approach thee, trust My honor, though I frowne, and call thee traitor I will study thy preserving next my owne, Is not this strange Pallante that heele take The guilt upon himselfe, if both have kild him Noe feare but hee's dead, this foole Pallante Shall quickly by his death secure thy Fate. Put on a cunning face meane time, and narrowly Observe the full behaviour of the Court, But 'specially insinuate with the greatest, And as they talke of me, declare my passion, And with what horror, I receav'd the death Of our good Duke, my pious zeale to appease That blessed spirit with his murderers blood, In care to their owne heads, they will proclaime Me Duke, i'le to Euphemia, and by some Strong art make her my owne. Pall. Your grace is prudent. Leo. Away to'th prison with 'em. Ar. Let me beare Him company my Lord. Leo. You sha'not doubt it Good Madam mischiefe, and repent together, As you are like to bleed, and with full torture, Howle out your wretched lives for the Dukes murder. Ar. You are deceav'd my Lord, we wo'not dye For that offence. Leo. You wo'not, glorious strumpet. Ar. Y'are a most Uncivill Lord, thy birth had not more innocence To justifie thy mother. Ben. Ile be modest, And say, this is not honourable. Leo. So Sir, You will have time to talke at your arraignment, Away with 'em, now to Euphemia. Exit. Enter Horatio, and Fiametta. Fia. Did you not send for me, and by this token? Ho. Follow me not, unlesse thou wo't sweare to imitate What I shall lead thee too by my example, For rather then not be rid of thee, at next Convenient river I will drowne my selfe, And thinke I goe a Martyrdome by water. Cannot a Gentleman be merry w'ee, But you will make him mad? Fia. Ile never leave thee, I will petition to the Duke, and plead A contract. Ho. Thou't be dam'd then. Fia. What care I. Ho. So, I shu'd have a blessing in this fiend, This child of darkenesse once remov'd, I send for thee, And by a token? I wo'd sooner send For the hang-man, and pay him double fees To strangle me, what I endur'd before, Thinke twas a pennance for some mighty sinnes I had committed, and be quiet now. Fia. Did you not love me then? Ho. Love thee? consider What thou hast said, and hang thy selfe immediatly, Ile sooner dote upon a mare, dost heare me, A mare with fourescore, and ninteene diseases, And she the greatest to make up a hundred, Then harbour one such monstrous thought, thou art A thing, no Cat that comes of a good kind, Will keepe thee company, and yet thou lookst So like a miserable ore-growne vermine, Now I thinke better on't, it is my wonder Th'art not devour'd quicke, leave me yet. Fia. Not I Sir, I know you love me still, all this is but To try my constancy. Ho. Art thou so ignorant, Or impudent, or both? let me intreat thee But to have something of a beast about thee, Thy sences in some measure, looke but how I frowne upon thee, for thy safety therefore, If thou hast no desire to save my credit Abroad, tame thy concupiscence, we draw All the spectatours but to laugh, and wonder at's, And I shall be the greater prodegy For talking so long with thee, wo't be rul'd, And trudge from whence thou camst, good honest bruite, My humours out of breath, and I ha' done, But all that's ugly in thy face, or what's Unseene deformity, I am now in earnest, And therefore doe not tempt me. Fia. My deere Signior. To what? Ho. Why, after all to beare thee, if Thou leav'st me not the sooner. Fia. Are not you My Servant? Ho. But in passion I forget things, And if my Mistresse want discretion, I shall, in my pure zeale to have her wise, Beate some into her, most abhominably Beate her, and make deformity to swell, She sha'not get in to her chamber doore. Ile bruise, and make thee up into a ball, And boyes shall kick thee home, dost thou not feare me? Fia. Ile endure any thing from thee, my love Shall thinke no paine a suffering, come, kisse me But once, and I will die thy patient martyr. Ho. She wo'd be kild, to have me hang for her, Was ever such an impudence in woman? You that are hansome Ladies, I doe aske Forgivenesse, and beleeve it possible You may be lesse vexations to men. Dost heare? to tell thee truth, for it will out By some, or other, you must here discharge Your dotage, for it is but two howers since I was married. Fia. Married? to whom? Ho. Toth' tother Wild beare that courted me, to Scolopendra, She met i'th nicke, and wee clapt up. And you know tis not conscience to abuse Our honest wedlocke. Fia. I shall runne mad. Ho. Wo'd thou wo'dst runne into the Sea, and see If I wo'd goe a fishing for thee. Fia. Furies, Rise in my braine, and helpe me to revenge. Ho. I am afraid she'l beate me now. Fia. False man, I have not breath enough to raile, and curse Thy apostacy, how couldst thou use me thus? But seeke some sudden way to be divorc'd, Or one shall dye. Ho. Wo'd thou wert buried quicke. Fia. But are You married, tell me sweet Horatio, And must I weare a willow garland for thee? Ho. Weare a halter. Fia. It is not possible, thou canst be so Unkind to me. Ho. You may beleeve it Madam. Fia. Yet I must love thee till I die, and you May keepe me alive, with now, and then some favour, It want's no president, we may kisse I hope, And thus walke arme in arme, I wo'd deny Thee nothing. Ho. Do not vanish me good Madam. A noise within. The people hoote already, none to reskue me. Enter Bentivolio, and Ardelia guarded. Is not this Bentivolio, under guard, And his faire Mistresse pinniand? how now friend, Wither are you bound with such a convoy. 1. To prison, they are traitors. Ho. Traitors. Ar. Do not beleeve 'em. 1. They have kil'd the Duke. Fia. How's that? 1. Doe you know him sir? Fia. Deere Madam are you prisoner too. Ho. Take me along, Better be hang'd then hanted with that goblin. 1. Another of the conspiracy disarm'd him. Ho. Let me but speake a word to this old Damsell. 1. Shee's of the plot too. Fia. I? I defie him, I know him not. Ho. I hope you wo'not leave me in distresse Love, Mistresse lady-bird. Fia. I defie all traitors Away with 'em, the Duke kil'd! out upon 'em, That Fellow alwayes had a hanging countenance Blesse me, defend me. Exit. Ho. 'Tis well treason will Make her forsake me yet. Ben. Dost know on what Danger thou dost ingage thy selfe? Ho. Although I die for company 'tis worth it gentlemen You know not how you have releev'd me Madam, I did expect you'd bring him into mischeife, I am perfect in your sex now, come to prison. Ar. You may repent your malice sir. Ho. And you May be a Saint, away with us, come friend, Women have made me weary of the World, And hanging is a helpe, we might ha' liv'd If you had tane my counsell, nay i'le share w'ed I ha' not lost all my good fellowship. Enter Duke disguis'd, with Euphemia. Exeunt. Eup. My sorrowes, I forgive you all, this blessing Has overpaid my heart, and though it cracke With weight of this so unexpected happinesse, I shall die more then satisfied. Du. Euphemia. Thou art too mercifull, and my repentance Is yet too feeble, and too short a wonder, Sure thou dost flatter me, if not heaven suffred, My fall with holy cunning to let thee Shine the Worlds great example of forgivenes. Eup. But wherefore does your grace come hither thus Disguis'd, being your selfe, and mine agen, what needs This cloude upon your person, truth did never Shame the professor. Du. Though I live to thee, The World doe thinke me dead Euphemia, Leonato whom I lov'd, and trusted most, Design'd my everlasting far-well from thee, But he that should have been my executioner, Without disordering this poore heape of nature, Gave me another life, and growth to vertue, Pallante, blest good man Eup. Leonates creature. Du. That honest Soldier after by his counsell, I put this shape on, while to my false kins-man He gives relation of my death, this key He lent for my accesse to thy sad chamber, I hope he is return'd. Leonato opens the dore. Tis Leonato. My heart o'th suddaine trembles with the feare Of a nere danger, I am unarm'd too, For our defenceâMadam you are not wise, And merit not this providence to dote Upon a shadow, your dead husband, when Leonato lives, with more ambition to Succeed him in your love, then this faire Duke-dome. Leo. What fellowes this that pleads my cause, tis some Pallante has appointed to prepare her, Du. With pardon, you deserve him not, and were I Leonatoâmy good Lord. Leo. Spare your Dull Retorick sir. Du. That I could snatch His sword, I dare not call for helpe, or leave 'em She may be lost within a paire of minutes, My heart, my braine! Leo. Madam you said your vow Was made for life, Fernizes death hath canceld That obligation, and in midst of teares Fate smiles upon you, if you dare looke up, And meete it with a will to be made happy He courts you now, has power to kill all sorrow, From these faire eyes, be just to your kind fortune, And dresse your face with your first beauty, Madam, It may become the change, why weepe you still. Eup. I weepe for you my Lord. Leo. For me. Eup. Because You cannot for your selfe, pray tell me sir, Is the Duke dead in earnest, you have not A mourning face, but great heires seldome dy With sudden greife, or weeping for their Father, Or Kins-mens Funerall, I pray how dy'd he? Although he were not kind to take his leave, I wod pay my obsequie of teares upon, His Hearse, and weepe a prayer to his cold dust. Leo. That may be time enough. Eup. How I desire To kisse his lip agen, oh shew me yet Where's the pale ruines of my dead Lord? stay He shall have halfe my soule, where's a soft, And silent breath I will convay to warme, And quicken his stiffe bosome. Leo. Madam, what's All this to my reward? Eup. Reward for what. Leo. My love which for your sake, and let me tell you Not without some encouragment from you, To give your heart more freedome to meet ruine, Hath sent the Duke to heaven. Eup. Thou art a murderer, Treason? Du. Treason. Leo. Who was that. Du. Some eccho Within the Chamber, nothing else my Lord. Leo. Is not the Dukes ghost hovering hereabout, It has a clamour like his voyce, ha, but I can take order for your silence, use That tongue againe, with the least accent to Affright the aire, and i'le dismisse thy soule, To waite upon thy husbands angry shade. Du. Horror? what can preserve us but a miracle? Leo. Yet i'le not so much favour you, 'tis death Perhaps you have ambition too. Du. One word My gracious Lord, it has been my trade to deale With women, with your pardon you do practise Too tame a court-ship for her nature, use The opportunity, and force her, to your Pleasures, away with Sword, and buckle with her, Leave me to keepe the doore, I ha been us'd to too't Shee'le thanke you when 'tis done, loose no time in talke. Leo. Ha? do thy office. Du. Wod your Lordship know me? You shallâwhat thinke you of this officer? False to thy blood, thy honour, and thy Prince, Y'are caught my precious kins-man, and I live With my owne hand to be reveng'd upon thee. Leo. Ha then thorow her, I will receive my mends, I did suspect that voyce, had not my confidence Of thy most certaine death betraid me thus, I wod have made sure worke, some Fate direct His Sword thorow both our hearts. Du. No Treason, Treason. Enter Pallante, Strozzi, Silvio, Ascanio, with a guard, they wound Leonato. Leo. So let me employ the short breath that remaines To tell you I engag'd Pallante, to The Dukes death with a full hope to satisfie Lust, and ambition, but he jugled with me, And so has Bentivolio, though he be With his Ardelia in prison, for Acknowledging himselfe your murderer, To which Vallerio, and my selfe inflam'd him. Du. Valerio traitor too. Sil. Sir he is slaine, His wounded body found in Ardelias chamber. Du. Ardelia! This darke mischeife shall be cleer'd Strozzi, command Bentivolo, And Ardelia be instantly brought hither? Str. I shall sir. Du. Most ingratefull Leonato. Leo. I know I am not worth your charity, And yet my Lord your cruelty upon Euphemia, and some licence I tooke from The example of your wanton blood, was ground Of these misfortunes, 't seemes Y'are reconcil'd, Be worth her love hereafter, thou wert just, Pallante, be still faithfull to thy Prince, I beg your generall pardon. Du. We forgive thee. Leo. Heaven is a great way of, and I shall be Ten thousand yeeres in travell, yet twere happy If I may find a lodging thereat last, Though my poore soule get thither upon crutches It cannot stay, far-well, agen forgive me. Pall. He is dead. Eup. I pity him. Enter Strozzi. Str. The prisoners waite. Du. Admit 'em. Enter Bentivolio, Ardelia, Horatio. Was your life so great a burthen That you upon the rumour of our murder, Would take the act upon you, though you had Promis'd to be the traitor, or did you Envy another man should owne the glory, And title of our bloudy executioner. Ben. I, but confest the guilt I then beleev'd. Du. This is a mistery. Ar. I can best cleere it. Sil. Tis my wonder how? Valerio was slaine. Ben. That I must answer, Although my Sword then promis'd to another Revenge, yet in the wound he met a Justice, I now repent not. Eup. What's that gentleman. Ho. I am one Madam that do court my friend here, So well that though he be in faire election To loose his Head, or to be Strangledâ Had rather take such as I find with him, Then live to be tormented with a woman. Eup. What woman. Ho. Any woman, without difference, I have heard your grace has a good fame, and though It does become your subjects to beleeve it, I was not borne here Madam, and i've had Such ill luck with your sex, it does not bind My faith, tis possible there may be good Both faire, and honest women, but they were never Under my acquaintance, no noe yet ilfavored, In whom I onely look'd to find a soule, But bost my labour. This is all truth Madam: Eup. His humour makes me smile. Du. Enough, not onely Our pardon for Valerios death, I give Thee back Ardelia, she was my Mistresse But I returne her pure as thy owne wishes. Ben. This grace is mighty sir. Du. Weele see you married, And what our person, and Euphemias Can adde to grace you. Ar. Y'ave already blest us, And heaven shower joyes upon you. Du. The next thing is to honor thee Pallante, Thou savest my life, and didst now marrie me, Thy faith is not rewarded. Pall. 'Was my duty. Ho. What, is all well agen? and is she honest. Ben.

For though he heare when you applaud, I'le say Your hands did seale my pardon, not the Play. FINIS.</field>
