      <field name="fulltext">THE CITYE MATCH. A COMOEDYE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Uersibus exponi Tragicis res Comica non vult. Horat. de Arte Poet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE TO THE KING AND QUEENE. The Author, Royall Sir, so dreads this Night, As if for writing he were doomd to th'sight. Or else, unlesse you doe protect his fame, Y'had sav'd his Play, and sentenc'd him to th'flame. For though your name, or power, were ith' reprive, Such workes, he thinks, are but condemn'd to live. Which, for this place being rescued from the fire, Take ruine from th'advancement, and fall higher. Though None, he hopes, sit here upon his wit, As if he Poems did, or Playes commit. Yet he must needs feare censure, that feares prayse, Nor would write still wer't to succeed ith' Bayes. For he is not oth' trade, nor would excell In this kinde, where tis lightnesse to doe well. Yet as the Gods refin'd base things, and some Beasts foule ith' Heard grevv pure ith' Hecatombe; And as the Oxe prepar'd, and crowned Bull Are Offerings, though kept back, and Altars full: So, Mighty Sir, this sacrifice being neere The Knife at Oxford, which y'have kindled here, He hopes twill from you, and the Queene, grow cleane, And turne t'Oblation, what He meant a Scene.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGVE AT BLACK-FRIERS. Were it his trade, the Author bid me say, Perchance he'd beg you would be good to th'Play. And I, to set him up in Reputation, Should hold a Bason forth for Approbation. But praise so gain'd, He thinks, were a Reliefe Able to make his ComÅdy a Briefe. For where your pitty must your judgement be, Tis not a Play, but you fir'd houses see. Look not his quill, then, should petitions run; No Gathering's heere into a Prologue spun. Whither their sold Scenes be dislikt, or hit, Are cares for them who eat by th'stage, and wit. He's One, whose unbought Muse did never feare An Empty second day, or a thinne share; But can make th'Actors, though you come not twice, No Loosers, since we act now at the Kings price. Who hath made this Play publique, and the same Power that makes Lawes, redeem'd this from the flame. For th'Author builds no fame, nor doth aspire To praise, from that which he condemn'd to th'fire. He's thus secure, then, that he cannot winne A Censure sharper then his own hath beene.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Actvs I. Scena I. Ware-house. Seathrift. I Promise you 'twill be a most rare plot. Ware-h. The Citty, Mr Seathrift, never yet Brought forth the like; J would have them that have Fin'd twice for Sheriffe mend it. Seath. Mend it? Why Tis past the wit oth' Court of Aldermen. Next Merchant Taylor that writes Chronicles Will put us in. Ware-h. For, since I tooke him home, Though, Sir, my Nephew, as you may observe, Seeme quite transfigur'd, be as dutifull As a new prentice; in his talke declaime Gainst revelling Companions, be as hard To be entic'd from home as my doore posts; This reformation may but be his part, And he may act his vertues. I have not Forgot his riots at the Temple. You know Sr ? Seath. You told me Mr Warehouse. Ware-h. Not the sea When it devour'd my ships cost me so much As did his vanities. A voyage to th'Indyes Has been lost in a night. His dayly suits Were worth more then the stock that set me up. For which he knew none but the Silk-mans book, And studied that more then the Law. He had His Loves too, and his Mistresses; was enterd Among the philosophicall Madams, was As great with them as their Concerners, and I heare Kept one of them in pension. Seath. My sonne too Hath had his Errours; I could tell the time When all the wine which I put off by whole sale He took againe in quarts, and at the day Vintners have paid me with his large scores. But He is reformed too. Ware-h. Sr, we now are friends In a designe. Seath. And hope to be in time Friends in Allyance, Sir. Ware-h. Ile be free, I think well of your sonne. Seath. Who, Timothy? Believ't a vertuous boy, and for his sister A very Saint. Ware-h. Mistake me not, I have The like opinion of my Nephew Sir, Yet he is young, and so is your sonne, nor Doth the Church-book say they are past our feares. Our presence is their bridle now: Tis good To know them well whom we doe make our Heires. Seath. It is most true. Ware-h. Well, and how shall wee knowe How They will use their fortune, or what place We have in their affection without tryall? Some wise men build their own Tombes, let us try If we were dead whether our Heires vvould cry, Or their long clokes: this plot vvill do't. Seath. Twill make us Famous upon the Exchange for ever. Ile home And take leave of my vvife and sonne. Ware-h. And Ile Come to you at your Garden house vvithin there. Ex. Seath. Enter Cypher. Scena II. Warehouse . Cypher. Now Cypher, where's my Nephew? Cyph. In the Hall Reading a letter vvhich a footman brought Just now to him from a Lady Sir. Ware-h. A Lady? Cyph. Yes, Sir, a Lady in distresse; for I Could overheare the fellow say she must Sell her Coach Horses, and returne againe To her Needle, if your Nephew not supply her With mony. Ware-h. This is some honourable seamstresse. I'me now confirmd: They say he keeps a Lady, And this is she. well Cypher, tis too late To change my project now. Be sure you keep A Diary of his Actions, strictly marke What company comes to him, if he stirre Out of my house observe the place he enters. Watch him till he come out: follow him disguised To all his haunts. Cyph. He shall not want a spy Sir. But Sir when you are absent if he draw not A Lattice to your doore, and hang a bush outâ Ware-h. I hope he will not make my house a Taverne. Cyph. Sir I'me no Sybils sonne. Ware-h. Peace here he comes. Enter Plotwell in a sad posture. Scena III. Ware-house . Plotwell. Cypher. Good morrow Nephew: how now? sad? how comes This melancholy? Plotw. Can I choose but weare Clowdes in my face when I must venture, Sir, Your reverend age to a long doubtfull voyage And not partake your dangers? Ware-h. Fye, these feares Though they become you, Nephew, are ominous. When heard you from your Father? Plotw: Never since He made the escape Sir. Ware-h. I heare he is in Ireland: I'st true he tooke your sister with him? Plotw. So Her Mistresse thinks, Sir, one day she left the Exchange, And has not since been heard of. Ware-h. And Nephew How like you your new course? which place preferre you The Temple or Exchange? where are, think you, The wealthier Mines in the Indies, or Westminster Hall? Plotw. Sir my desires take measure And forme from yours. Ware-h. Nay tell me your minde plainely, Ith' City tongue. I'de have you speake like Cypher. I doe not like queint figures, they doe smell Too much o'th' Innes of Court. Plotw. Sir, my obedience Is ready for all impressions whichâ Ware-h. Againe? Plotw. Sir I preferre your kinde of life, a Merchant Ware-h. Tis spoken like my Nephew: Now I like you. Nor shall I ere repent the benefits I have bestow'd, but will forget all Errours, Exit Cyph. As meere seducements: And will not only be An Unkle but a Father to you: But then You must be constant, Nephew. Plotw. Else I were blind To my good fortune, Sir. Ware-h. Think man how it may In time make thee oth' Citie Senate, and raise thee To th'sword and Cap of Maintenance. Plotw. (Yes, &amp; make me Sentence light bread, and pownds of butter on horse-back.) Ware-h. Have Gates and Conduits dated from thy yeare; Ride to the Spittle on thy free beast. Plotw. (Yes, Free of your Company.) Ware-h. Have the people vaile As low to his trappings as if he thrice had fined For that good times imployment. Plotw. (Or as if He had his Riders vvisdome.) Ware-h. Then the workes And good deeds of the Citie to goe before Thee, Besides a troop of Varlets. Plotw. (Yes, and I To sleep the sermon in my Chaine and Scarlet. Ware-h. How say you? Lets heare that. Plotw. I say, Sir, I To sit at sermon in my chaine and scarlet. Ware-h. Tis right, and be remembred at the Crosse. Plotw. And then at Sessions, Sir, and all times else, Master Recorder to save me the trouble, And understand things for me. Ware-h. All this is possible, And in the starres and windes: therefore deare Nephew, You shall pursue this course, and to enable you In this halfe yeare that I shall be away, Cypher shall teach you French, Italian, Spanish, And other Tongues of Traffique Plotw. Shall J not learne Arithmetick too, Sir, and short-hand? Ware-h. Tis well Remembred, yes, and Navigation. Enter Cypher. Cyph. Sir, Mr Seathrift saies you 'will loose the tyde, The boat staies for you. Ware-h. Well, Nephew, at my return As J heare of your carriage, you doe know What my intentions are; and for a Token How much I trust your reformation, Take this key of my Counting-house, and spend Discreetly in my absence. Farwell. Nay No teares; Ile be here sooner then you think on't. Cypher you know what you have to do. Cyph. I warrant you, Sr. Exit Plotw. Teares? yes my melting eyes shall run, but it Shall be such teares as shall encrease the tide To carry you from hence. Cyph. Come Mr Plotwell shall I Read to you this morning. Plotw. Read what? how the price Of sugar goes, how many pints of Olives Goe to a jarre, how long wine workes at sea, What difference is in gaine betweene fresh herrings And herrings red? Cyph. This is fine, ha you Forgot your Uncles charge? Plotw. Prithee what was't? Cyph. To learne the Tongues &amp; Mathematiques. Pl. Troth If I have tongue enough to say my prayers Ith' phrase oth' Kingdome J care not; otherwise I'me for no tongues but dry'd ones, such as will Give a fine rellish to my backragg; and for Mathematiques, I hate to travail by the Map, Me thinks Enter Bright &amp; Newcut. Tis riding post. Cyph. I knew twould come to this. Here be his Camerades. Plotw. What my Fleetstreet friends? Exit Cypher. Scena IV. To Him Bright and Newcut. Br. Save you Merchant Plotwell. Newc. Mr Plotwell Citizen and Merchant, save you. Br. Is thy Uncle Gone the wisht voyage? Plotw. Yes, he's gone, and if He dye by th'way hath bequeathd me but some Twelve hundred pound a yeare in Kent, some three- Score thousand pound in money, besides Jewels, Bonds, And desperate debts. New. And dost not thou fall downe And pray to th'windes to sacrifice him to Poore John and Mackrell? Br. Or invoke some rock To doe thee justice? New. Or some compendious Canon To take him off ith' middle? Plotw. And why my tender Softhearted friends? Br. What to take thee from the Temple To make thee an old Juryman, a Whittington? New. To transforme thy plush to pennystone, and scarlet Into a velvet Jacket which hath seene Aleppo twice, is knowne to the great Turke, Hath scapt three shipwracks to beleft off to thee, And knowes the way to Mexico as well as the Map? Br. This Jacket surely was imploy'd in finding The Northeast passage out. Or the same Jacket That Coryat died in. Plotw. Very good. New. In Ovid There is not such a Metamorphosis As thou art now. To be turnd into a tree Or some handsome beast is courtly to this. But for thee, Franck, O Transmutation! Of Satin chang'd to Kersy hose I sing. Slid his shooes shine too. Br. They have the Gresham dye. Dost thou not dresse thy selfe by 'em? I can see My face in them hither. Plotw. Very pleasant Gentlemen. Br. And faith for how many yeares art thou bound? Plotw. Doe you take me for a prentice? New. Why then what office Dost thou beare in the parish this yeare? Let's feele, No batteries in thy head to signifie Th'art Constable? Br. No furious Iugge broke on it In the Kings name? Plotw. Did you contrive this scene By the way Gentlemen? New. No, but the Newes Thou shouldst turne Trades-man, and this Pagan dresse, In which if thou shouldst dye thou wouldst be damned For an Usurer, is comicall at the Temple. We were about to bring in such a fellow For an Apostate in our Antimasque.

Besides, my Mother was Afraid to venture me. Plotw. Believ't she's wise, Not to trust such a wit to a thinne frayle barck Where you had saild vvithin three inches of Becomming a Jonas. Besides the tossing, to have All the fierce blustring faces in the Map Swell more tempestuously upon you then Lawyers preferrd, or Trumpeters. And vvhither Were you bound now? Tim.

Surely you may, and ayre'em too, there have been Very devout and holy women that wore No shift at all. Aur. Such Saints you meane as wore Their Congregations, and swarm'd with Christian Vermin. You'l hold cleane linnen Heresie? Dor. Surely yes, Cleane linnen in a Surplesse; That and powders Doe bring dry summers, make the sicknesse rage, And th'Enemy prevaile, It was revealed To Ms Scruple and her husband, who Doe verily ascribe the German warre, And the late persecutions, to curling, False Teeth, and Oyle of Talck.

Why whats the matter? Aur. Never Poore Lady had so much unbred holynesse About her person; I am never drest Without a sermon, but am forct to prove The lawfulnesse of curling irons before She'l crisp me in a morning; I must show Text for the fashions of my gownes, she'l aske Where Jewels are commanded, or what Lady Ith' primitive times wore ropes of pearle or rubyes, She will urge Councells for her litle ruffe Calld in Northampton shire; and her whole service Is a meere confutation of my clothes. Banesw. Why Madam, I assure you time hath beene However she be otherwise, when she had A good quick wit, and would have made to a Lady A serviceable sinner. Aur. She can't preserve (To guift for which I took her) but (as though She Were inspird from Jpswitch) she will make The Acts and Monuments in sweet-meats; Quinces Arraigned and burnt at a stake; all my banquets Are persequutions, and Dioclesians dayes Are brought for entertainment, and we eat Martyrs. Banesw. Madam she is farre gone. Aur. Nay, Sir, she is A Puritan at her needle too. Banesw. Indeed? Aur. She works religious petticoats; for flowers She'l make Church Histories; her needle doth So sanctify my Cushionets, besides My smock-sleeves have such holy imbroderies, And are so learned, that I feare in time All my apparell will be quoted by Some pure Instructer. Yesterday I went To see a Lady that has a Parrot, my woman While I was in discourse converted the fowle, And now it can speak nought but Knoxes workes, So theres a parrot lost. Banes. Faith Madam she Was earnest to come to you, had I knowne Her Mistresse had so bred her I would first Ha preferd her to new England. Dor. Surely, Sir, You promised me when you did take my mony To help me to a faithfull service, a Lady That would be saved. Not one that loves profane, Unsanctified fashions. Aur.

This was of your preferring, You must needs help me to another. Banes. How Would you desire her qualified, deformed And crooked like some Ladies, who doe weare Their women like black patches to set em of? Aur. I need no foile, nor shall I think I'me white Only between two Moores; or that my nose Stands wrong, because my womans doth stand right. Banes. But you would have her secret, able to keepe Strange sights from th'knowledge of your Knight vvhen you Are married, Madam, of a quick faining head? Aur.

Then, Sir, in time You may be remembred at the quenching of Fired houses, when the bells ring backward, by Your name upon the Buckets. Tim. Nay they say You have a good wit Lady, and I can finde it Assoone as another: I in my time have been Oth' University, and should have been a scholler. Aur. By the size of your wit, Sir, had you kept To that profession, I can foresee You would have been a great persecuter of Nature, And great consumer of rush Candles, with As small successe, as if a Tortoise should Day and night practise to run races: Having Contemplated your selfe into ill lookes, In pitty to soe much affliction, You might ha past for learned: and 't may be, If you had fallen out with the Muses, and Scapt Poetry, you might have risen to scarlet.

Cladders? Aur. Yes, Catholick Lovers, From Countrye Madams to your Glovers wife, Or Laundresse; will not let poore Gentlewomen Take physick quietly, but disturb their pills From operation with your untaught visits. Or if they be imployd, contrive small plots Below staires with the Chamber-maid; commend Her fragrant breath, which five yards of salutes, At foure deflowers a Rose, at three kils spiders. New. What dangerous truths these are? Aur. Ravish a lock From the yellow waiting-woman, use stratagems To get her silver whistle, and way-lay Her pewter knots or bodkin. New. Pretty, pretty. Br. You think you have abused us now? Aur. Ile tell you, Had I in all the world but forty Mark, And that got by my needle and making socks; And were that fortie Mark Mil-sixpences, Spurroyals, Harry groats, or such odde coine Of husbandry as in the Kings raigne now Would never passe, I would despise you. New. Lady, Your wit will make you die a witherd virgin. Br. We shall in time when your most tyrant tongue Hath made this house a wildernesse, and you As unfrequented as a states man fallen; When you shall quarrel with your face and glasse, Till from your pencill you have raisd new cheeks, See you beg suitors, write Bills ore your doore, Here is an ancient Lady to be let. New. You think you are handsome now, and that your eyes Make star-shooting, and dart? Aur. 'T may be I doe. New. May I not prosper if I have not seene A better face in signes, or ginger-bread. Tim. yes, I for two pence oft have bought a better. Br. What a sweet innocent looke you have! Plotw. Fye gentlemen, Abuse a harmlesse Lady thus, I can't With patience heare your blasphemies.

Gentlemen doe I Look like one of them Trojans? Aur. Tis so, your face Is missing here, Sir, pray step back againe And fill the number; you I hope have more Truth in you then to filch your selfe away, And leave my roome unfurnisht. Plotw. By this light She'l send for a Constable straight and apprehend him For the every. Tim. Why Lady doe you think me Wrought in a Loome, some Dutch peece weavd at Mooreclack? Aur. Surely you stood so simply, like a Man Penning of Recantations, that I suspected Y' had been a part of the Monopolie. But now I know you have a tongue, and are A very Man, Ile think you only dull, And pray for better utterance. Plotw. Lady you make Rash judgement of him, he was only struck With admiration of your beauty. Tim. Truly And so I was. Aur. Then you can wonder, Sir? Plotw. Yes when he sees such miracles as you. Aur. And love me can't you? Tim. Love you? By this hand Ide love a dog of your sweet looks; I am Enamour'd of you Lady. Aur. Ha, ha, ha, now surely I wonder you weare not a cap; your case Requires warme things, Ile send you forth a Cawdle. Exit. Br. The plague of rotten teeth, wrincles, lowd lunges Be with you Madam. Tim. Had I now pen and inke, If I were urgd I'de faine know whether I In conscience ought not to set down my selfe No wiser then I should be. Plotw. Gentlemen How like you her wit? Tim. Wit? I verily Believe she was begotten by some wit; And he that has her, may beget plaies on her. New. Her wit had need be good it finds her house. Tim. Her house? Tis able to find the Court, if she Be chast to all this wit, I doe not think But that she might be showne. Br. She speaks with salt, And has a pretty scornefulnesse, which now I'ue seen I'me satisfied. New. Come then away; To Roseclaps. Tim. Lead on, Let us dine: This Lady Runnes in my head still. Foot.

How rarely 'twould become you To run ore all your shop to passengers In a fine sale tune? Aur. What would you have me doe? D'you think I'me the Dutch Virgin that could live By th'sent of Flowers? Or that my familie Are all descended of Chameleons, And can be kept with ayre? Js this the way To get a husband to be in danger to be Shut up for house-rent, or to weare a gowne Out a whole fashion, or the same Jewels twice? Shortly my neighbours will commend my clothes, For lasting well, give them strange dates, and cry Since your last Gorget and the blazing starre. Plotw.

Faith brother 'tis no age to be put off With empty education; few will make Ioyntures To wit or good parts. I may dye a Virgin, When some old widdow which at every cough Resignes some of her teeth, and every night Puts off her Leg as duly as french Hood, Scarce weares her owne Nose, hath no eyes but such As she first bought in Broad-street, and every morning Is put together like some Instrument, Having full Coffers shall be wooed, and thought A youthfull Bride.

Captaine, the houre is come, You shall no more drink Ale, of which one draught Makes Cowards, and spoiles valour; nor take off Your moderate quart-glasse. I intend to have A Musket for you, or glasse Canon, with A most capacious barrell, which we'l charge, And discharge with the rich valiant grape of My Uncles sellar, every charge shall fire The glasse, and burne it selfe ith' filling, and look Like a Peece going off. Quartf. I shall be glad To give thanks for you, Sir, in pottle draughts, And shall love Scotch cole for this wrack the better, As long as I know fuell. Plotw. Then my Poet, No longer shall write Catches, or thinne Sonnets, Nor preach in verse, as if he were suborn'd By him that wrote the whip, to pen leane Acts, And so to overthrow the stage for want Of salt or wit. Nor shall he need torment Or persecute his Muse; but I will be His God of wine t'inspire him. He shall no more Converse with the five yard butler, who like Thunder Can turne beere with his voice, and roare it sower; But shall come forth a Sophocles, and write Things for the Buskin. Insteed of Pegasus, To strike a spring with's hoofe, we'l have a steele Which shall but touch a But, and straight shall flow A purer, higher, wealthier Helicon. Salew. Frank, Thou shalt be my PhÅbus. My next Poem Shall be thy Uncles TragÅdie or the life And death of two Rich Merchants. Plotw. Gentlemen, And now yfaith what think you of the fish? Ware-h. Why as we ought, Sir, strangely. Br. But d'you think It is a very fish? Seath. Yes. New. Tis a man. Plotw. This valiant Captaine and this man of wit First foxt him, then transform'd him. we will wake him And tell him the newes. Ho Mr Timothy! Tim. Plague take you Captaine. Plotw.

Your Father And my grave Uncle, Sir, are cast away. Tim. How? Plotw. They by this have made a meale For Jacks and Salmon. They are drownd. Br. Fall downe And worship sea-coales, for a ship of them Has made you, Sir, an Heyre. Plotw. This fellow here Brings the auspicious newes: And these two friends Of ours confirme it. Cyph. Tis too true, Sir. Tim. Well, We are all mortall; but in what wet case Had J been now, if I had gone with him. Within this fortnight I had been converted Into some Pike, you might ha cheapned me. In Fish-street; J had made an Ordinary, Perchance at the Mermaid: Now could I cry Like any Image in a fountaine which He faines to weepe. Runs Lamentations. O my hard misfortune! Seath. Fie Sir, good truth it is not manly in you, He feignes to weepe. To weep for such a slight losse as a father. Tim. I doe not cry for that. Seath. No? Tim. no; but to think My Mother is not drownd too. Seath. I assure you, And thats a shrewd mischance. Tim. For then might I Ha gone to th'Counting house and set at liberty Those harmelesse Angels, which for many yeares Have been condemnd to darknesse. Plotw. You'd not doe Like your penurious Father, who was wont To walk his dinner out in Pauls, whiles you Kept Lent at home, and had, like folk in seiges, Your meales weighed to you. New. Indeed they say he was A Monument of Pauls. Tim. Yes, he was there As constant as Duke Humphrey. I can show The prints where he sate holes ith'loggs. Plotw. He wore More pavement out with walking then would make A row of new stone-Saints, and yet refused To give to th'reparation. Br. I've heard Heed make his Jack goe emptie to cousen neighbours. Plotw. Yes, when there was not fire enough to warme A Mastick path t'apply to his wives Temples In great extremity of toothach. This is True, Mr Timothy, ist not? Tim. Yes. Then Linnen, To us was stranger then to Capuchins. My flesh is of an Order with wearing shirts Made of the sacks that brought ore Cutchyneele, Copprice, and Jndico, My sister weares Smocks made of Curran-bags. Seath. Ile not endure it. Lets show our selves. Ware-h. Stay heare all first. New. Thy Uncle Was such another Plotwell; I have heard He still last left th'Exchange; and would commend The wholsomenesse oth' ayre in Moore-fields, when The clock struck three sometimes. Plotw. Surely my selfe, Cypher his Factor, and an ancient Cat, Did keepe strict diet, had our Spanish fare, Foure Olives among three. My Uncle would Look fat with fasting; I ha knowne him surfet Upon a bunch of Raysins, swoone at sight Of a whole joynt, and rise an Epicure They undisguise. From halfe an Orage. Ware-h.

J doe hate thee now, Worse then a Tempest, Quick-sand, Pyrate, Rock, Or fatall Leake, I or a Privy seale. Goe let the Captaine make you drunk, and let Your next change be into some Ape, (tis stale To be a Fish twice) or some active Baboone. And when you can find mony out, betray What wench ith' Roome has lost her maiden-head; Can mount to'th King, and can doe all your feats, If your fine chaine, and yellow coat come neere Th'Exchange, Jle see you, so I leave you.

Plot.

Or some great statesman, before whom you must sit As silent and reservd as if your looks Had plots on forreine Princes, and must visit And dresse your selfe by Tacitus. What he wants In Naturals, his fortunes will make up In Honours, Pen; when hee's once made a Lord, Who'l be so sawey as to think he can Be impotent in wisdome?

Cowards nere won Ladies, or Forts, Sir. Tim. Say then I should feele Some motions, Lady, of affection; might A man repaire Pauls with your heart, or put it Into a Tinder-box? Aur. How meane you, Sir?

      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGVE AT WHITE-HALL. The Author was deceiv'd, for should the Parts, And Play which you have seen, plead Rules &amp; Arts, Such as strict Criticks write by, who refuse T'allow the Buskin to the Comick Muse, Whose Region is the People, every straine Of Royalty being Tragick, though none slaine: He'd now, Great Sir, hold all his Rules untrue, And thinks his best Rule is the Queen and You. He should have searcht the Stories of each Age, And brought five Acts of Princes on the Stage. He should have taken measure, and rais'd sport, From persons bright, and glorious as your Court; And should have made his Argument to be Fully as high, and great as They that see. Here, he confesseth, you did nothing meet But what was first a ComÅdy ith' street: Cheapside brought into verse, no passage strange To any here that hath been at th'Exchange. Yet he hopes none doth valew it so low As to compare it with my Lord Maiors show. Tis so unlike, that some, he feares, did sit, Who missing Pageants did or'esee the wit. Since then his Scenes no pomp or Highnesse boast, And low things graced show Princes Princes most, Your Royall smiles will raise't, and make him say, He onely wrote, your liking made the Play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGVE AT BLACK-FRIERS. Once more the Author, ere you rise, doth say Though he have publique warrant for his play, Yet he to th'Kings command needs the Kings Writ To keep him safe, not to b'arraign'd for Wit. Not that he feares his name can suffer wrack From them who six-pence pay, and six-pence crack. To such he wrote not; though some parts have been So like here, that They to Themselves came in. To Them who call't reproofe to make a face, Who think they judge when they frown ith'wrong place; Who if they speak not ill oth' Poet, doubt They loose by th'Play, nor have their two shillings out, He saies, he hopes, they'l not expect he'd wooe, The Play being done, they'd end their sowre looks too. But before you who did true Hearers sit, Who singly make a box, and fill the Pit, Who to his ComÅdy read, and unseen, Had thronged Theaters, and Black-Friers been, He for his Doome stands; your Hands are his Bayes; Since They can onely clap, who know to praise.</field>
