      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene.âThe Monastery of Tchudoff, the gate closed. Maria, (the dowager Czarina,) habited in the order of black Nuns, enters, followed by others of her Convent, and approaching the gate, announces her arrival. Mar. Peace to the holy brotherhood of Tchudoff! Twice seven long years of slow-revolving time Have number'd my sad sighs, since by the hands Of savage murderers my Demetrius fell; And ever as this black and mournful day Comes yearly round, by sufferance I appear Before these gates, sad mother, to beseech A requiem for the soul of my dear son. Will they not come, or must a widow'd queen Wait at their portal? A Monk appears at the gate. Monk. Who is at our gate? Mar. Maria Feodorafna, a poor suitor For your good offices with the strong angel, Who keeps the gates of purgatory barr'd, Till holy men like you can move his pity. Monk. I'll send one to you of authority: I am but menialâAnd behold! here comes The deacon OtreneifâHe'll speak to you. Demetrius enters, habited as a deacon. Dem. Now, ye veil'd sisters, what d'ye want? Mar. Your prayers, Dem. Our prayers indeed! Will not your own suffice To keep your consecrated flesh and blood In due allegiance to your holy vows? Mar. Are you a deacon of this pious order, And answer with such levity? Dem. I am; Like you, I am cull'd out from Nature's flock To check the world's increase, and contradict Creation's first great law. Mar. You are too bold: You know me not. Dem. Nor am I known by you; Elseâ Mar. What else? Are you other than you seem? Hah! what is that I see beneath your eye? How came you by that mark? Dem. My mother gave it. She was a great astrologer, and held Familiar commerce with a fav'rite star. It is a mark o' th' mother. Mar. Heaven defend me! Dem. Amen! I leave you to these reverend fathers: Lo! where they beckon you. Go in; go in. They'll give you pray'rs enough; I reserve mine For greater purpose, and at greater need. [Exit Demetrius. The Monks having rang'd themselves on each side, the Scene draws off, and discovers the interior of the Chapel: the Prior advances, and addresses himself to the dowager Czarina. Prior. Peace and Heav'n's grace be with you evermore, Most honour'd lady! What are your commands For us your humble beadsmen? Mar. Reverend Prior, Full well you know my customary suit, As this sad day comes round. Why name it to you, When the whole empire feels and mourns my loss? Prior. Heav'n give you comfort! Mar. 'Tis from Heaven I seek it, When I solicit of your holy choir A solemn requiem for the guiltless soul Of my Demetrius, so may I indulge A pious hope, that, by your pray'rs set free, My sainted innocence may be received Amongst the blest in Heaven; and now behold The congregated fathers only wait Your signal to begin their solemn chaunt. Prior. Strike up the canticle for the departed, Nam'd in our holy service The Resurge, Whilst the sad parent joins her pray'rs with our'sâ Solemn Air.(Organ. âResurge, resurge, infans carissime! âO dilecte fili matris amantissimÃ¦! âTandem ut, solutis vinculis peccatorum, âUnus sis inter choros angelorum: âConcede hoc nobis, custos mortuorum!â [Scene closes as the strain concludes. A Street in the City of Moscow. As Demetrius is passing over the stage, Petrilla runs out from a house, and calls to him. Petril. Father, father, hear me, I beseech you. Turn an ear of pity on a poor damsel, and grant me the boon of your good offices for the love ofâOh dear, I had almost said for the love of HeavenâBut now I look upon you, Sir, I'm sure I need not trouble Heaven to move your pity. Dem. You need not trouble me. I've nothing for you. Petril. Oh yes, you have: So young, so comely, and with an air so noble, I'm sure you cannot find it in your heart to be uncourteous to a female suitor. Dem. Get you gone, hussey! I'm not for your purpose. I've left off practice in your way of business. Petril. You have not left off praying I shall hope, and that's my present business with your reverence. I have a mother in the house you see, bedridden and dying. Give her your holy help in her last momentsâ Dem. If she is dying, let her die in peace. Petril. But that, she cannot do, having a certain scruple on her conscience. Dem. I am no casuist for an old woman's scruples. If you have any such to reconcileâ Petril. You are the very man to do it. I believe you; but my case, just now, does not require your help; my mother's does. Dem. What is your mother's case? Petril. Oh! that's a secret of such mighty import, as only can be told in close confession. Dem. What secret can your mother have to tell? Who is your mother? Petril. Catherine, the wife of Peter Bassovitzâ Dem. What! she that nurs'd the Czarowitz Demetrius. Petril. Yes, she; the very womanâ Dem. Lead me to her instantly. Away, you lapwing, fly with all your speed. [They enter the house. Scene changes to a room in Peter Bassovitz's house. He is sitting at a table. A bottle and glasses. Peter. Pet. Heigho! sad times, sorrowful times! Only one poor old wife left to comfort me, and she's at her last prayersâLord help the wicked! Every groan she gives, pierces my heart; then I swallow a glass of brandy, to reconcile it to my feelings. [Petrilla, followed by Demetrius, passes hastily to the chamber of Catherine.] There! there goes the death-warrant for my dameâ A confessor and a coffinâSo the world passesâ Death is commonâWe must all dieâflesh is grass, time mows it down, and man is mortalâ These melancholy truthsâHolla! who's this? Ah, Donski, is it you? Donski enters. Dons. Yes, here am I. What ails you, Peter? You seem out of spirits. Pet. Hush! not so loud. Thank you for your kind enquiries: I am a little out of spirits myself, but there's some left in the bottle. Shall I help you to a cup? Dons. Not a drop, not a drop. I have an oath against it. Pet. Have you indeed? That's an oath I never took; but you Tartars have a knack of swearing. Give me your hand, however! So you are come to the festival of our great Saint, Alexander Newski. I am vastly glad to see you; but what shall I do to make you welcome? You say you won't drink: perhaps you would eat a slice of something. I am sorry I have no horse-flesh to set before you; but I'm quite out of it. Dons. Make no apology: I have an oath against that alsoâbut where is the good dame, Catherine, your spouse? Pet. In the next chamber: don't speak of her; you'll break my heart. Catherine is dying; her confessor is with her: Dons. Well, well, well! be content. Greater than she must die. The Czar himself is not long for this life; and then we'll have a sovereign of the house of Ruric. Pet. Where will you find him? Recollect yourself. Ivan is dead, and Theodore is dead; they were the last, except Demetrius. Dons. And 'tis Demetrius we are sworn to elect. Pet. Why then I swear you must elect his ghost. Dons. How now! 'tis false. I have spoken with those, that have seen him alive. Come, come, no more of this! We know he's living, and we look to you, who had his life in charge, now to produce himâAye, and you shall produce him, Peter Bassovitz, or woe befall you. Pet. Gently, my good friend, gently. What wou'd you have me do? I can't keep breath in an old dying woman, neither can I bring a dead prince to life again. Dons. Tell that to the Cossacks, if you dare. We are encamp'd, ten thousand strong; and all are bound under an oath never to touch the flesh of animal, or taste the spirit of the grape, till we have set Demetrius on the throne. [Demetrius comes out from the chamber of Catherine.â Dem. Well, honest Peter, I've confess'd your wife; I have her deposition here in scriptis. 'Tis a receipt in fullâ Pet. Yes, father, she had many good receipts. Dem. And one beyond them all for excellence. I owe my life to it. What do you stare at? Don't you recollect me? Pet. I can't say I have the least recollection of you, reverend father. Dem. That's wonderful. You have danc'd me in your arms a thousand times. Pet. Whuh! that's a good one. [Aside. Dons. Brush up your memory, Peter. Don't you hear the gentleman? Pet. Yes, I hear the gentleman, but I have no memory of him, or about him. Dem. Away! You are sand-blind, and can't see Nature's hand-writing legible in my faceâ [Turns to Donski.] I think I heard you speaking of DemetriusâBe pleased to tell me how I am to accost you. Dons. Donski the Cossack; second to the Hetman. Michael Merowitz enters hastily. Mic. The Czar is deadâThere's news for you, my masters! Dem. Who says that Boris Godenoff is dead? Mic. I say it. Ah, friend Griska, are you here? Dem. Silence! you know not who it is you speak to. Mic. Not know my fellow-traveller and friend? Many a hundred weary wersts we have trudg'd. In Poland I remember we were Jews; Christians in Moscovy; in Cracow, you took up the trade of a conjurer, and in Moscow, ofâ Dem. A Czarâfor such I am by blood and right. Stand not amaz'd, but hear me to the end. Catherine, my nurse, now on the bed of death, has recognized me for the true Demetrius: her daughter heard, and will attest the facts, to which her dying mother has deposed. Michael has told you to what various shifts I have been put whilst Boris sought my life; he knows me for the true and rightful prince; he has long had the secret in his keeping, and calls me Griska by my travelling name; and honest Peter here, by whose contrivance I was sav'd from murder, now may speak out, and he shall feel my bounty, so he maintain the truth. Pet. Tell me what truth you wish me to maintain, and I'll stick to it. Dons. I'll tell you, PeterâDown upon your kneesâYou know me for a man of few words, but steady to my purpose. Let's have no double-dealing. I am satisfied you are in presence of the true Demetrius. Down on your knees, and own your rightful prince! [Peter kneels. Petrilla enters. Petril. Aye, father, that's all right, and as it shou'd be. Dem. Stand up, old man, and look me in the face. You recollect this mark upon my cheek. Pet. Oh yes, I see it there on your right cheek; it was upon your left, the very same! it cannot be mistaken; I remember it. Dem. I'm glad your memory is in part come to you. Petril. Father, take care. My mother has confess'd. The prince knows all the story, how you took the money to destroy him out of handâ Pet. 'Tis false, I took no money. Petril. Yes, you did, father, you know you did: you took the money, but you sav'd his life. Pet. Aye, aye, I sav'd his life; that I remember; that I am perfect in. Dem. Come, come! no more. Put that old fool aside! His senses wander. To you, brave Donski, I commit the task, to move your gallant Cossacks in my cause. Dons. We are ten thousand strong, and to a man will turn out for Demetrius and his right, Michael is with us also. Mic. Heart and soul: to my last drop of blood, I am your man, and for Demetrius. Dem. I'll fetch the Dowager Czarina forth from out her convent, and she shall attest I am the true Demetrius, and her son. The patriarch shall confirm it, and the people shall see the ancient dynasty of Ruric in me restored; Now then, my friends, take notice on this day, Saint Newski's day, which evermore has brought fortune and favour to my ancient race, I start for empire; and when you hear the evening bell ring out, in the great square before Saint Michael's church, there I will meet you, and present myself to the assembled people as their Czar, which that I am, you are my witnesses. So, farewell all! Be constant, and we triumph! [Exit. Mic. There's a brave spirit; take my word for that. Ah, masters, he's a right one, he's a true one. Pet. But is he true Demetrius? tell me that. Mic. As sure as you are Peter, he's Demetrius. What, don't I know him? Pet. Yes, you call'd him Griska. Mic. Tut! what are names? I have called him by more names than I have fingers. In Poland he was Griska: we did a few things there, that got us into more fame, than was quite convenient; so we beat our march back to Moscow, and here my friend Griska took a billet on the convent of Tchudoff, by the style and title of Deacon Otreneif. Now, what do you find in all this, that shou'd prevent you from discovering the true Czarowitz; especially when even your owl eyes can see the seal of Nature stampt upon his cheek? Dons. Now, Peter, what do you say to that? Speak out. Petril. Aye, father, what do you say to that? My poor dear mother rais'd herself in bed, look'd at him steadily, and by the mark, pronounc'd him the true prince. Pet. 'Tis certain that the Czarowitz, my charge, was mark'd upon the cheek: it wou'd have been a mole in common faces; in his, by courtesy, it was a star. Mic. Well, and a star it is. Pet. But not a fixt one: it has changed its place. Dons. 'Tis false. Take care that you don't change your place, if you give such half-evidence; and mark me! I and my comrades search not into titles; we steer not by the stars, but go right on, resolv'd to have a Czar of our own choosingâTherefore, do you mind me; if your citizens will not elect Demetrius this night, there shall not be a house, no, not a hut, in Moscow standing by to-morrow morningâTake that on my word, and good bye to you. [Exit Donski. Petril. There, father, did you hear him? Pet. Yes, I heard him. He is a Tartar, and don't know the comfort of living in a house; but come, my child, we must attend upon your dying mother. Mic. A word before you go. Now mark me, Peter. Our fortune is at issue: half measures will not serve us: either confirm the whole, or contradict the whole. If you are against us, we will have your life; if you are for us, we will make your fortune. You've had your warning; therefore, choose your part. Pet. Well! we shall see. Petrilla, follow me! [Exit Peter. Mic. Stay, my sweet girl; I hope you mean to come to the great square. Petril. At evening bell I'll come. Mic. Then we shall meet again. Petril. I shall expect you; but remember, Michael, if there is fighting, you must take care of me. Mic. Ah, you dear rogue, I love you. That's enough. [Exeunt severally.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene, a kind of Ante-Chapel within the Convent of Tchudoff.âA Monk is discovered in attendance. Demetrius enters. Dem. Well! has your dowager Czarina had her sufficit of masses, and gone home? Monk. Not yet; she is coming forth from chapel. Dem. And will she pass this way? Monk. I am waiting for her, as in duty bound. Dem. 'Tis well: 'tis very well. I'll keep watch with you. Ah! she's a right-good lady, (is she not?) to have so very motherly a concern for a dead son? If he were living now, and in the purgatory of this wicked world, how many masses, think you, wou'd it take to set him free, and put him fairly in the way of fortune? Monk. How shou'd I answer that, seeing that purgatory is not for the living, but for the dead? Dem. Nay, learned Sir, but you have answered it with most discreet and orthodox precision: yet, under favour, can you not conceive there are as many purgatories on this side death, as there are duns, debts, persecutions, imprisonments, vexations, tiresome talkers, long-winded homilies, and old decrepid tantalizing misers, that stand upon the threshold of their graves, and won't step into them? Monk. To none of all these cases can I speakâ but see! Maria Feodorafna comesâ Maria enters, followed by a train of Nuns. Mar. Where'er I pass, the vision is before me; And lo! again I meet himâSpeak, declare! Who art thou, that in likeness of the dead, Spite of thy habit, draw'st my eyes upon thee In contemplation of an awful mark, A token so particular, as in none, Save one dear object, ever met my sight. Dem. Illustrious lady, when your face was veil'd, I knew you not; and after my plain way, Unconscious of your dignity, addressed you In terms, that merited your just rebuke: But as the things, of which I have to speak, Are such as can in no wise entertain These holy sisters, though to you and me Of high concernment, I must urge my suit To speak in private with you. Mar. Be it so! Sisters, I pray you to withdraw at once: Let ceremonies be dispens'd with, I conjure you. [The Nuns withdraw. There! They are gone. What is it that controls me? What power so absolute enwheels you round, That as your countenance enchains my eyes, So does your voice my ears! Oh! it comes o'er me, As I had heard it somewhere in time past, Or listen'd to it in my dreams perhaps With motherly delight. Dem. You have, you have; Bear witness for me, Nature, you have heard it, For 'tis Demetrius, 'tis your son that speaks, Your long-lost living son. Mar. Support me, save me! [She leans on his shoulder. Be still, and give my whirling brain a pause For recollectionâCan Demetrius live? Cou'd their fell daggers miss the heart they struck at? Ah, noâdeceive me not. It cannot be. Heav'n on its beauteous model stamp'd a star, A mark, celestial, never to be forg'd; Such as no mortal faceâ'Tis there, 'tis there! I see itâ'Tis the evidence of sight, The seal of fate, the signature of truth. By whatsoever miracle restored, Come to my heart!âThou art my long-lost son. Dem. I am your son: your prayers were not mispent, They're only gone before me. Snatcht from death, I've been a wanderer, seeking up and down Precarious shelter under various names In various countriesâbut of this hereafterâ The story of my pilgrimage is long, And asks more leisure; for the time is come, When I must cast this priestly frock away, And self-elect as Autocrat assume The royal mantle, which of right is mine; And never will I put it off, till death Shall tear it from me, in my life-blood drench'd. Mar. Ah, my too brave, too venturous son, beware! This odious Czar is watchful and alert; His eye is every where; he is all ear, And his arm reaches to the utmost bounds Of his extensive empire. Dem. Fear him not! A stronger arm hath reach'd him: he is dead. Mar. Amazement! dead?â Dem. Be not amaz'd. 'Tis so, Though news, that circulates through all the world, Cannot pervade the crannies of your cloister. Therefore it was I never risk'd a line, Knowing none such wou'd be allow'd to reach you. And now it grieves me much, that for a time You must return to count the lonely hours, Till the first sun, that rises on my hopes, Shall with its beams dispel our convent's gloom, And give you glorious to the world again. [Leads her out, and the scene closes. A room in the house of Peter Bassovitz Peter alone. Pet. I begin to think it is high time to take care of myself. My old crony, Michael Merowitz, has too many crotchets in his head, and I believe I must forego the pleasure of his society; for the owl that makes one upon a water-party with the gander, shall scarcely escape drowning. Yet Michael is a fellow of such companionable pleasantry, that if the gallows did not stand in the back ground of his prospect, I wou'd be content to go on with him to my life's endâbut that is one way of ending life I had rather be excused from. Michael enters. Mic. This day a monk, and the next day a monarchâ Pet. What's that you are talking about? Mic. Ah! who are you?âA speck under your right eye?âNo, you have specks in both eyes: you are not the manâTen thousand Tartars, they will do the jobâCymbals, and clarinets, and screaming fifesâHow I long to see them come thundering down into the great square!â Pet. How I long to see you go thundering down into any square, street, or kennel, out of this house! Mic. Then you will see me in my proper glory; cutting and slashing like another Yermac. Pet. Cut and slash any where but hereâ There is the door; pray, make use of it. Mic. Don't be too familiar, Peter Bassovitz. Less freedom, and more good manners, will become you better. You don't know who you are speaking to. You'll hear of me, you'll hear of me, before the day is over. Pet. I dare say I shall. Your dying speech and confession will be cried about the streets. Mic. Muzzle your wit, my master! When Demetrius shall be proclaimed, you'll find yourself on the wrong side. Pet. No; then I'll turn over to the right one. Mic. Aye, then you'll recollect him well enough. Pet, Why, 'twou'd refresh my memory I confess, if ever that shou'd come to pass. But don't let me detain you. You may resume your meditations in the open air: I'll wait upon you to the door. Mic. I am charm'd with your politeness, Thank you for your pleasant company, and hospitable entertainment. When I have a house of my own, you shall be quite as welcome to walk out of it, as I am out of your's. Good bye to you! [Exit Mic. Pet. This is a case of difficulty on both sides; yet, as I must take one side or the other, I have no choice left but to choose the strongest. Certain it is, I can trace the features of the boy in the countenance of the man; and I can't deny the mark upon his cheek, though I may puzzle the question between right and left. He may, or he may not, be Demetrius: let other people settle that, my business is to take care of Peter Bassovitz. [Exit. Scene, a Chamber in the Palace. Theodore and Irene. Iren. I own, dear brother, orphans as we are, We may well mourn the loss of such a father, But there shou'd be a measure in our sorrow. Thy mind, sad prince, hath need of all the strength That it can summon, to support the weight Which this vast empire will devolve upon thee. Theo. I was not made to reign: I've no ambition. My wishes being few are shortly told: Give me a station humble as my thoughts, And as my passions peaceful: let me live Beyond the reach of faction, where no feuds May ruffle my tranquillity, no fears Disturb my solitude: little will serve To satisfy my wants, and had I more Than simple Nature needs, 'twou'd be to much. Suiska enters. Suis. Health to our Sovereign Lord! Long live the Czar! Theo. No, no, Suiski; Czars do not live long. Is not my father dead? Suis. In you he lives. Theo. My father's spirit with my father died: My humble nature cannot entertain it. Suis. O lost to glory! Yet, by right of office, As Regent in the vacancy of empire, I must of force proclaim you. Theo. If you must, So let it be! My fate is in your hands, And you must deal with me, a helpless creature, As to your will seems meet. [Exit. Suis. Oh ill-tim'd weakness, Now when we have a rival to contend with, A false Demetrius, formidably leagu'd With the wild Cossacks, that embay our walls. Iren. Demetrius! Surely he was kill'd at Uglitz. Who is this bold impostor? Suis. Time admits not To tell you who he is, for instant means Must be adopted to prevent his plot, Or we are lost. Iren. Go, and success attend you! [Exeunt severally. Great Square of St. Michael, with a side view of the Cathedral, &amp;c. Michael Merowitz and Petrilla. Mic. Here we are, my gallant wench, here we are in the square of Saint Michael, and there is his churchâI bow to it devoutlyâWe have fobb'd old Peter, and are off. Lord love you! how fond you must be; but no wonderâand yet you don't know half my merit. Petril. I don't know any. Let me hear it; I dare say it is soon told. Mic. I have a most sweet and placid temperâ Petril. So has a tyger. Mic. A delicate and most exquisite sensibilityâ Petril. So has this stone pavement. Mic. A large heart, and unbounded generosityâ Petril. Those may be call'd your sleeping virtues, having no means to waken them, as you have nothing whatever to bestow. Mic. Wait till to-morrow; then tell me I have nothing to bestow: wait only till Demetrius is Czar, then tell me who will be the richest subject in Moscovy. Mark me! This being Saint Alexander Newski's day, I went to church and said my prayers for luck; and there, as luck wou'd have it, I fell asleep, which you know is natural; and in my dream, what do you guess I saw? Petril. A gibbetâthat, I'm sure, is natural. Mic. No, you saucy rogue, a palaceâa fine house, richly furnished, given me by the Czar, with servants, equipage, and all things needful to set me up in a styleâ Peter enters with Constables. Pet. Well met, friend Michael! So, I warrant you are come to see the showâthat's rightâand took my daughter with youâthat's kindâThe girl is curious, that's the truth of it; and 'twill be a fine sight. Mic. Aye, won't it? Who are these men with you? Pet. I suppose he will only shew his mark, put up his finger to his eye, exhibit his credentials, and be crowned upon the spotâ Mic. Very likelyâbut I say, Peter, who are these rabscallions? Pet. And when that's over, you'll be a great manâ Mic. Shan't I?âI don't like the looks of them: they seem to be listening. Pet. And I suppose you mean to take my daughter under your protectionâ Mic. Undoubtedlyâif I am not taken first myselfâ [Aside. Pet. That's friendly. Petrilla is a handsome wench, and perhaps you have a liking for herâ Mic. Oh, a very great liking for herâbut just now I shou'd like to be offâ [Aside. Pet. Lay hold of him, officers! I charge you with him as a disturber of the peace, and a traitor to the state. [Music as of soldiers on the march.] Hark! what is coming now? Mic. Demetrius, Demetrius is coming! Hands off, rascals! The Cossacks are upon youâHah! Suiska!âConfusion! I am lost. Pet. No; you are foundâ Suiski enters with heralds and a guard of soldiers. Justice, Lord General, justice on this traitor! Suis. Who calls for justice, and which is the traitor? Pet. I am the honest man, who calls for justice; and this the criminal, whom I accuse. Suis. What has he done? Pet. No one good action in his life, so please you, but every thing that's wicked and most vile. Suis. You must be more specific in your charge. Pet. I will, Sir: he's a vagabond; he has rambled into countries, where impudence is to be had for nothing, and brought home such a stock of it, that he has stolen my daughter, and made off with her. Petril. I am here, noble Sir. I am not stolen; therefore, that charge is void. Suis. As it should seem. Are you in your right senses, friend? Mic. No, Sir, he's moon-struck; a poor crazy creature; we only came, like other harmless folks, to see the sight and hear the proclamation. Pet. Yes, and to bellow for the false Demetrius: I denounce this rascal, Michael Merowitz by name, to be his friend and crony, his fellow-traveller and pot-companion, the stickler for his party, and the mouth-piece of his mob. Suis. Knowing all this, perhaps you know the man who calls himself Demetrius. Pet. Oh yes, I know him well. Suis. And you know him to be an impostorâ Pet. Far be it from me to contradict your Excellency at the head of your troops; I am staunch for Theodore, and ready to declare, that Demetrius, so called, is no better than an impostor. Suis. Then you will have an opportunity of declaring that to his face, for I hear him on his march.â[Bugle sounds.]âSoldiers, stand fast! make no show of resistance; the Cossacks will out-number us, ten to one. We'll offer them a parley, and hear what this pretender has to say. Pet. With your good leave, Lord General, I'll run and call more helpâ Suis. Hold that prevaricating fellow fast. Pet. Besides, I recollect my wife lies dead. I pray you, let me go and bury her. Suis. Sirrah, we have your evidence. Stand to it! Pet. What evidence? Good lack, I gave no evidence, that I can call to mind. Mic. I'll help your memory, Peter! never doubt me. Donski and the Cossacks march in with Demetrius, (richly habited in the Polish dress,) at their head. Suis. Halt, gallant Cossacks, we are here assembled, As friends of peace and order, to proclaim A successor to the now vacant throne. If then there is amongst you one, who holds Priority of right before the son Of Boris Godenoff, let him come forth, And state his title! Dons. Lo! he stands before youâ The true DemetriusâWe are satisfied: We have proclaim'd himâWhat have you to say? Suis. Nothing to say against the true Demetrius, But much good cause to doubt if he survive; Over whose mangled body, gor'd with wounds, Weeping I stood, and with these very eyes Saw the last hope of Ruric's sacred line Borne to the grave, a cold and lifeless corpse. Dem. You are Suiski; are you not?â Suis. I am. Dem. And you believe you saw Demetrius deadâ I am not careful to dispute the assertion Of your belief; yet, if I gave you credit For the sincerity, with which you wept Over the mangled body, I must think It was because you found you'd miss'd your aim, And that the true Demetrius had escap'd you. He had, Suiskiâand the corpse you saw Borne to the grave, did not possess one drop Of Ruric's blood, whose sacred line survives In me, now living to assert my right. Dons. And you shall have your right. Perish all those Who dare to oppose it! Let our swords decide. Dem. Oh, not in blood, my friends, not in the blood Of my dear subjects let me mount the throne. My strength is in my cause, and whilst there's found One, that denies my right, until I reign Over all hearts, let me not reign at all. And now, though many will be found to witness That I am true Demetrius, you, Suiski, The last of all men living to depose, Through partial favour to my cause or me, Shall be the first, to whom I will appeal. Do you remember, when your Czarowitz At Uglitz was install'd Knight of the Cross, A certain medal, pendant to a chain Of onyx, which you gave him? Suis. I do remember. Dem. Was it like this? Suis. The very same. Dem. 'Tis well. Once more I call your conscience to the testâ Manhood, 'tis granted, will efface the child; But marks by nature stampt upon the frame Are not rubb'd out by time. Had not Demetrius A kind of sanguine star below his eye On his right cheek? Suis. Demetrius had that mark. Dem. Behold he has it still. Suis. I do confess it. Dem. There stands a man, that can depose to it For twelve years pastâWhy do you keep him bound? A witness shou'd be free. Suis. Loose him at once. [They loose him. Mic. Thank you for nothing. Give me up my sword. I'm glad your highness has had timely thought Of your poor Michael. Have I seen that mark For twelve years past? Yes, have I, and will swear it Upon the holy book by every saint, Saint Alexander Newski into the bargain. Dons. We are all satisfied. What need of more? Dem. Be patient, my good friends! Let me proceedâ This damsel will inform us what she heard Her mother, Catherine Bassovitz, confess Upon her death-bedâOn your conscience speak! Petril. I heard my mother solemnly declare, Her senses being perfect, you, the Prince, Then standing in her sight, were true Demetrius, The rescued Czarowitz, whom she had nurs'd. Dem. Where is your father? Let him now stand forth. Petril. Ah, royal Sir, he knows not what he says, He's old and childish; his poor wits are wand'ring. Pet. So please you, Sir, I am, as she has told you, An old man, almost in my second childhood, My wife is dead, my eyes are dim with weeping, And grief hath shook a memory never strong. I know my dame vouched with her dying breath, That you, dread sir, were the sweet babe she nurs'd, And I don't doubt she spoke the very truth; Nay, I am sure she did; but 'twas with me A standing rule to cross my loving wife, Though 'twere against my conscience, and I hope You will not punish me with your displeasure Only for contradicting an old woman. Dons. Prince, you descend too far. We are not here To litigate your title, but elect you. Dem. Summon the council; cite me to the board; Sift me with questionsâCall my mother forthâ Maria Feodorafnaâlet her speak! Who has a better right to know the son Than she, who bore him? I appeal to her; And by my sainted ancestor I swear, If she does not acknowledge me her son, Let all the world renounce meâNow, Suiski, Does this content you? Suis. It is nobly offered: I am content. Dem. Enough! I now promulgate To all, however hostile to my cause, Forgiveness and oblivion: To my friends I pledge a heart, that never will forget One single act of charity and kindness, However slight, in my distress conferred. But these are words: actions shall speak for me. Now to the councilâGallant Cossacks, march! Chorus. âHe comes, he comes, he comes! âWith echoing cymbals, and with rattling drumsâ. âThe Cossacks of the Don âIn triumph lead him on, âThe long-lost, living, true Demetrius comes.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene the Council Chamber. The Patriarch, the General Suiski, and the chief Officers of State are assembled. The Patriarch rises. Pat. Nobles and senators, you now have heard What the illustrious claimant, who attends The issue of your judgment, had to state In proof and vindication of his right To be acknowledged as the true Demetrius: This fact admitted, (and to me it seems That none dispute it,) what remains for us But to receive him, as in duty bound, And pay our homage to the nation's lord? Suis. Most grave and reverend Patriarch, I rise Not to oppose, but humbly to remind you, That our late Czar hath left to your protection Two orphan relics: shall we now make terms For these defenceless innocents, or leave them To what the policy of our new Czar May deem convenient for himself and them? Pat. Lord General, let benevolence be free: Mercy shou'd wear no fetters, nor will he, Whose word is law, receive a law from usâ [Trumpets. Hark! he is at our doorsâRise, and receive him! The doors are thrown open. Demetrius, leading in Maria Feodorafna, enters. Pat. Demetrius, we, your subjects, with one voice, Salute you rightful Czar of Moscovy: Ascend your throne! Dem. Your patienceâThere remains One other witness to confirm my rightâ Maria Feodorafna, by your hopes Of Heaven, and heavenly mercy, I conjure you, Now at the peril of your soul declare, Am I, or am I not, this kingdom's heir, The true Demetrius, your acknowledg'd son? Mar. Not for a thousand thrones wou'd I disguise The truth, so challeng'd. By my hopes of Heaven, At peril of my soul, I do avouch, You are my son, you are the true Demetrius. Dem. You hear the avouchments, sirs; does any doubt? Pat. Not one. 'Twere treason and a high offence Against the majesty of truth to doubt it. Once more I sayâDemetrius, mount the throne! Dem. I am not come to surfeit you with thanks: That wou'd be fulsome, that wou'd be a mockery, To shame your justice, and degrade my right: For I am no impostor, and must reign, Or you must shut your eyes against the truth, And do me wilful wrong; but I am come To assure you of a heart, which I have pledg'd To all the duties of that arduous task, Whereto your judgment and my fate have doom'd me. My country's welfare will be all my pride, Her laws my rule, her happiness my own, My first ambition, and my ceaseless care. I have known sorrow; I have deeply drunk The gall of harsh unkindness, and endured The bitterness of penury and want: Therefore, let all men know that I will reign In mercy and forbearance, and I hope Your wisdom, learned Sirs, will find some means To keep men honest, and your persons safe Without blood-shedding, for this hand of mine Never shall sign away the life of man. Pat. Nobly resolv'd! You make all hearts your own. Long may you reign, and happy be your days! Dem. Now, though the tyrant Boris sought my life, Yet is it not my nature to revenge The father's wrongs upon the guiltless son. To you, Suiski, this remark applies: You have the person of your prince in charge; Set him before me! So shall all confess, You have not arm'd a man with sovereign power, Who is not able to command himself. Suis. I shall impart your pleasure to the prince, And much it will console him, gracious sir, To hear these generous sentiments confirm'd By your own royal promise. Dem. I have said. There needs no farther promise to confirm it. [Exit Suiski. I send not for this unambitious youth, To buy opinions by a vain display Of public clemency, but to convince you How much it gratifies me to reflect That you have suffer'd me to mount the throne, Pure, and unsullied with my subjects' blood; That you have not compelled me to resort To other claims than I have laid before you, Nor forced your lawful prince to draw the sword, And bathe it in the vitals of his country. War knows no justice; force may conquer right, And I wou'd reign in charity and peace. Suiski presents Theodore. Suis. Lord of this mighty empire, you behold An orphan prince, who comes prepared to hear And ready to obey your sovereign will. Dem. Prince, the Supreme Disposer hath ordain'd To you the calm of life; to me the storm. We must obey our fates. Believe me, Sir, It is not in my heart to offer wrong Or to your peace or person. You are free; Nor other motive have I to request This interview, and trouble your repose, Save in my zeal to tender you my hand In pledge of service; and consult your wishes What for your grace and honour I shou'd do. Theo. For grace but little; for my honour less. Alas, ambition is for ever dead In this sad heart, that breathes no other wish, Puts up no other prayer to Russia's Lord, But that, which granted, honours the bestowerâ A prayer for life: freedom I never had, For I was born to greatness, and of course Was train'd in slavery, and cannot expect From you, a stranger, more than I enjoy'd Under a father's rigour. All desires, If Nature ever planted such within me, Were crush'd or ere they budded. Grant me only A decent prison, and a gentle keeper, That will not treat me harshly. Dem. None shall treat you But with the tenderest care: you shall be free; Live where you like, and with the friends you love: I lay the map before you; choose your spot: If you call that a prison, it must be Your mind that makes it such: I've none to grant. Pat. Sir, you must suffer me to call your thoughts To objects more immediate, and remind you That we have ceremonies to perform, Which may not be delay'd: your people wait, The heralds are assembled to proclaim you, And the time wears. Dem. The time shall be obey'd. Suiski will attend his princely charge. [All the characters, but Theodore and Suiski, go out in procession with Demetrius, as Czar. Suis. You are not curious, sir, to see this sightâ Theo. No, for my presence might perhaps arouse Contention, and provoke him to revenge: I only wish to pass my days in peace. Did you not mark how kindly he address'd me, How gentle were his looks, how mild his words? Suis. Yes; he has words at will; how they will match With his performance, time alone can show. Theo. Well! I must take my fortune as it falls. I'll to my sisterâ Suis. I attend you, sir. [Exeunt. Scene, a Street in Moscow. Michael Merowitz and Petrilla. Mic. There, there, there, my girl! I told you how it wou'd be. We carry all before us: the council are convinc'd; Demetrius is Czar of Moscovy, and I am the man who made him such. Did not you observe, when I gave my evidence, how still, how silent, how respectful, all the square-caps sate, pondering my words? And when I had got hold of their attention, did'n't you take notice how I touched them up with a neat stroke of the pathetic? âMy lords,â said I, âmany a time and oft his majesty and I have seen the sun go down, when we had not even a shrub to shelter us: I have then stript off my cloak to cover him as he slept, and kept watch in my doublet till the morning broke.â That was very well, wasn't it, Petrilla? Petril. Yes, yes, it let them know, that he, who has stood by his friend in the dark, will not run away from him in the light. Mic. They have proclaimed him Czar. I am a made man. You'll see a great change in me, when I am once settled, and have my comforts about me. Petril. I hope I shall. It must be for the better, if you change at all. Mic. I shall ask the Czar for one of his spare palaces; then I'll lay up, study my own ease, cultivate the fine arts, and grow sentimental. Petril. I hope you'll grow rich withal. Mic. To be sure I will. Why, I shall have all Great, Little, and White Russia at my feet, like a snow-ball. Then you'll hear flattery in full chorus; then the parasites shall so plaister me with praise, that there shall not be a cranny left for satire to creep in at. I'll have a stable full of poets, like highwaymen's horses, ready bridled and saddled to turn out at a moment, and prance over the raggamuffins, if they dare to libel me. I'll have pictures, statues, medals, and a museum; I'll be the greatest collector of books, and the best preserver of bindings in the kingdom; no man shall soil them with a touch; I care nothing for their contents, but I have a very great respect for their coverings. Peter Bassovitz enters. Pet. Well met, friend Michael! I rejoice in your good fortune. Bring me off, my dear fellow, with your friend Griska at a pinch. Speak a kind word for me to his Czarish Majesty, for the sweet sake of Petrilla. Mic. Don't be troublesome. I have nothing for you. You bore witness against Demetrius. Pet. Yes, but I bore witness for him also, and almost in the same breath. Every man must have time to recollect himself. Mic. You did not see the mark upon his cheek till the crown was on his head. Pet. No, because that thief, Suiski, stood between me and the light, and I am somewhat purblind. Mic. Go along! nobody cares about you. You are a witness on both sides; of course, you are believed on neither side, and scouted on all sides. Pet. Lookye, friend Michael, when two parties are at issue, if the father takes one, and the son-in-law the other, they are arm'd against events. If Theodore had prevailed, I wou'd have been your friend; now Demetrius has carried it, you must be mine. Petril. And he shall be your friend. Michael is the best-tempered fellow breathing: he has too merry a heart to bear malice, and too much love for me to harm my poor father, hav'n't you, Michael? Mic. I have a prodigious deal of love for you, but I have some for myself, and old Peter here wou'd fain have laid me in for a few strokes of the knout. Now, though I fear neither pain nor death, I don't positively love either of them; but, as you truly say, I am a sweet-tempered fellow, and though I know it well enough, I don't greatly dislike to be told so. Therefore, hold your tongue, old Peter, and fall back, for I see the Czar is comingâKeep the fool out of sight, and perhaps his folly may be out of mind. Martial music. The procession of Nobles returning from the coronation. Demetrius, preceded by the Patriarch, and followed by Donski and the guard of Cossacks, closes the procession.â Michael steps forth to pay his homage, and Demetrius stops. Mic. Heaven bless your majesty! Dem. What wou'd you with me? Have you aught to ask? Mic. So please your majesty, I had conn'd a speech, the best that my poor breeding cou'd provide, but it has slip'd me in your royal presence; and so I humbly hope you will recollect, though you were born to be a king, I was not born to be a courtier. Dem. Well, what is your petition? State it. Mic. If your majesty, amidst all your cares, shall graciously be pleased to think of your poor servant Michael, I doubt you will call to mind a pretty many of my failings at the same time; but I am bold to say, want of affection towards you is not amongst the number. Dem. You stuck to me in poverty and sorrow; When the sun shines upon my better fortune, I will not leave an old friend in the shade; May Heaven forget Demetrius in that hour! [Demetrius passes on, and the procession being closed, Michael, Peter, and Petrilla, are left upon the stage. Mic. Harkye, Petrilla! Did you remark how graciously he noticed me? Petril. Did you observe how charmingly he look'd? Pet. Well, 'tis surprising how his dress has chang'd him. Now that I see him in that princely habit, I have as perfect a recollection of his countenance, (Heaven bless the mark!) as if it were but yesterday I had dandled him on my knee. Petril. Michael! Mic. What say you, my gay wench? Petril. If for my sins it shou'd be my hard fate to marry you, remember, I must go to court. Mic. Go to court! aye, and you shall keep a court. What tell you me of marrying for your sins? Am I not friend and favourite of the Czar? Boyar, prince, potentate?âI am, and youâAh! you arch-rogue, I've sworn itâ You are in my arms, you bewitching little Moscovite!â Song. âAnd when you're Michael's wedded mate, The Wasslers shall be singingâ One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eightâ While the merry bells are ringing. So fresh, so fair, So de bon air, Trickt out so trim and nice, You trip so neat, Your nimble feet Peep in and out like mice. âYour skin so dazzling to my sight, Your lips so plump and rosy, Your teeth in pearly rows so white, Your breath like any posey; When as I spy Your roguish eye, It darts so sweet a glance, Pit-pat, pit-pat, This way and that, My heart begins to dance.â</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. A magnificent Chamber in the Palace. Irene is discovered; she rises as the curtain is drawn up, and advances. Iren. So! all is finish'd, and Demetrius reigns: The earth throws up her dead; the buried corpse Starts into being, and is made the monarch Of those, who were his murderers. 'Tis well! If so Heav'n wills it, let the mystery pass. Yet blood shall follow, for Suiski flies, And his ambition must disturb the world, Fly where he will. Sad times are coming on For thee, my brother; and for me what hope, But that I may be doom'd to some lone cell, List'ning no sounds but those of pious prayers, And virgin voices chanting midnight hymns. An Officer of the court enters. Offi. Illustrious lady, I appear before you With a petition (so I'm charg'd to term it) From our new Czar Demetrius, who requests To pay his court to you. Iren. What do you mean? Must I interpret this as meant in mockery, Or did Demetrius seriously enjoin you To announce him in those words? Offi. Suspect me not. I faithfully report the very words, As I received them from his royal lips. He waits your answerâ Iren. Oh, be speedy then! Let not his royal courtesy be put To further trialâSay, that I expect, With most profound submission, his commands. [Exit Officer. What must I think of this mysterious man? The mild and gentle semblance he assumes May be put on to win the hearts of men, Who crouch'd beneath my father's iron sway. It mayâTill fortune shall have fix'd his power, It may be policy to wear a mask; But if it be his nature to be cruel, He'll soon throw off that maskâAnd see, he comesâ Demetrius enters. Dem. I've ask'd this interview, tho' I confess, 'Tis out of season to intrude upon you; For sorrow should be sacred, and the daughter Of an unburied father should possess The sabbath of her mourning unprofan'd. Iren. You conceive rightly, sir, it was my wish. Dem. Yes, royal lady, I can well believe How hateful above all men I must be, For having robb'd you of those splendid hopes Which, till my fortune threw a cloud before them, Beam'd with such dazzling brightness. Yet I hope, That so much of your hatred, as results From fear and terror, you will let me banish By taking heav'n to witness, that my heart Cannot conceive a thought to harm Irene. Iren. Heav'n only knows the heart. Dem. I cannot wonder That you are slow to credit him for truth, Whose very essence you are taught to think Is falsehood and imposture: Thus describ'd, I stand prejudg'dâbut noble minds, like your's, In candour will confess, that were I false, I should be cruel too, and, having power, Use it as tyrants and usurpers do. Iren. Mercy should be the attribute of kings, By whatsoever title they may reign. Dem. Sav'd by the hand of Providence from death, And after fourteen years of painful exile At length restor'd, I have forgiv'n all wrongs Done to myself, and in the conscious sense How mercifully Heav'n hath dealt with me, Am purpos'd whereso'er my power extends, My mercy shall go with it. Now, fair princess, If this avouchment set your mind at peace, I have fulfill'd the purpose of my visit, And shall withdraw an object from your sight, Which I can plainly see that you regard With terror and distrust. Iren. O, say not that! You've giv'n auspicious promise to the world Of a benignant nature, royal sir, By your compassionate and generous care Of my unhappy brother. Dem. Ah, that brother, Had there been no Demetrius in the world, Was never born to reign; therefore to him, Who suffers little loss, I may have made A competent atonement; but to you, To you, Irene, form'd to grace a throne, The disappointment, your ambition feels, Must be too deep, and I despair of pardon. Iren. What pardon can the Lord of Russia ask Of me, who only by his mercy live? Me, too unworthy to deserve a throne, And much too unambitious to desire it. Dem. That you're unworthy to possess a throne Is what I'll hear from no one but yourself; That you are not ambitious to partake it, Till my short reign be past, that I believe: But when my star shall set, yours will ascend, And you will reign: It is your destinyâ Nay, start not, when I prophecy so fair! Iren. Ah, spare me, sir! Your anger let me feel, If that I meritânot your mockery! Dem. Banish suspicion; you alike mistake My nature and your own; I cannot mock you, And you cannot deserve it. Hear me, now, For I am seriousâThough I mount the throne Arm'd with such means as might secure my power, Yet will I rather singly brave my fate, And combat all the peril I foresee, Than ask of you what you ought not to grant, Nor I t' acceptâA hand without a heart. Now be sincere, IreneâDo I know you? Iren. I hope you are too generous to exact An answer to that question. Dem. It is answer'd. Too well I know where you bestow'd that treasure, Which might have bought tranquillity and peace For me and for the multitudes, that form This mighty empire; nor am I to seek For him, whose factious spirit is at work To mesh me in his toils. Iren. Believe it not. Let not suspicion taint your nobler thoughts; There's no such traitor. Dem. Am I then deceiv'd, And do I wrongfully accuse Suiski? Is it by my command he has recall'd The army of the Ukraine from their march, Array'd them, bought them with the public money, Which, at your father's death, he seiz'd and drain'd, Leaving me nothing but the empty coffers? And is he now approaching to the gates Of this devoted city for my service, To do me homage? Is the army mine, Or his, who pays, maintains it, and commands it? And for what purpose?âTo confirm my power, Or to erect his own?â Iren. What can I say? What to these various charges can I plead But that you now behold me at your mercy, Your hostage for the loyalty of him, Whom you suspect of treason? Dem. You my hostage! Irene, no! That policy I leave To tyrants and usurpers. You are free, Free as the air you breathe; you shall not pledge One moment of your freedom for Suiski: When all the nobles moved me to arrest him, When at a word I might have stript him bare Of power to harm me, for your sake I spared him; And if by sparing him I shall have drawn Death on myself, my enemies shall own I had my country's happiness at heart, When I left you, so worthy to succeed To that imperial throne, from which I fell. [Exit. Iren. What is this man? Or is he more than man? He speaks like one inspir'd, and seems to have Fore-knowledge of his fate. I've done him wrong: He's no impostor; he is true Demetrius. Suiski has deceived me: So I'll tell him; This instant I'll forbid him to advance. He, who rebels against his rightful prince, Rebels at his soul's peril, and defies Heaven's vengeance, which no traitor can escape. [Exit. An Apartment in the House of Michael Merowitz. Michael followed by a Servant. Mic. Harkye, fellow, who are all these people assembled in my ante-chamber, and what are they waiting for? Ser. To pay their compliments to you, and entreat your favour. Mic. To pay their compliments!âpay 'em their fees, that's all the favour they entreat of me. Ser. Sir, you mistake; they are persons of high rank and respectability; they want no fees. Mic. I am glad to hear it; I shall be the sooner rid of them. So, d'ye see, present my compliments to them in return, and say I have the honour to wish them a very good afternoon âWhat do you stare at? I have said it. Disappear. [Exit Servant.] By the life of me, there is more trouble in being a great man than I was aware of. A Clerk enters, carrying papers. Mic. Who are you? What do you come here for? Don't you know this house is mine? Clerk. I know it is your house. Mic. Then why do you enter it without my leave? Clerk. I am commanded by his Czarish Majesty to put this deed of gift into your hands, together with this order on his treasurer for certain monies. Mic. I am glad to hear they are certain. Let me see 'em. Are you the treasurer? Clerk. No, sir, I treasure nothing but the favours, that generous gentlemen bestow upon me, when I attend them by the Czar's command. Mic. Humph! Is this all you have in command from the Czar? Clerk. This is all. Mic. Are you quite sure there is nothing overlook'd? Clerk. Perfectly sure. Mic. Recollect yourself. Search your pockets. Clerk. Upon the honour of a gentleman, I have no one article in charge to give you more than I have now delivered. Mic. Good day to you! Clerk. Humph! nothing else? Mic. Nothing else, upon the honour of a gentleman. Fare you well! [Exit Clerk.] An arrant sharkâI'm fairly rid of him. But hold! Let me look a little at these papers. I am afraid my old companion is rather alter'd by his sudden elevation; yes, he's an alter'd man; but great heights will turn men giddy; perhaps I find something of that sort in myself just nowâHah! here's a paper in his own hand-writingâThis may edify. I'll read itâ âMichael Merowitz, âI have given you a house, well furnished and appointed, with monies, lands, and vassals, to support it. I have made you rich; be contented with riches. Aim not at rank or power. Do not venture to solicit me for offices of state or titles, which neither birth nor talents fit you for. The various characters I have assumed in the scenes, which you have been concerned in with me, were adapted to the difficulties we were in: the character in which I must now appear, as Czar of Moscovy, is my natural character, and therefore look well to your conduct, as you respect my favour and protection. âDemetrius, Autocrat.â Humph! very well, excellently well, Demetrius Autocratâvery pithy and concise: you are in your natural character, it seems; I liked you better in your artificial one, as my friend and crony Griska, but let it pass, let it passâI must look well to my conduct, it seemsâthat I hope I can do, and yet spare a little time to look to my comforts alsoâ Michael. âSure he knows I'm a fellow of spirit, That won't bate him an inch of my merit; Have a care, my friend Grisky, And be not too frisky, I am touch'd in a sensitive part; I have plenty of scars, That I got in the wars, But ingratitude cuts to the heart. Have I stuck to this desperate rover, Wet and dry, hot and cold, the world over, Begg'd, borrow'd, and robb'd, Am I now to be fobb'd With his house and a handful of money? I am not such a fly, No, believe me, not I, To be caught with a spoonful of honey.â Peter enters. Pet. Ah, my sweet Michael, my dear son-in-law, that is to be; you have stept into good quarters, my happy fellow, o' my conscience. You have got a very pretty kind of a house over your head. Mic. You are right: I'll have any man's house over my head, or any man's head over my house; but don't be so familiar. No sweet Michael, with your leaveâno happy fellow; I am not sure I am happy. When I had no money, I had no cares; when I had no house I had no visitors; and now, if you recollect how readily you desired me to walk out of your house, you may guess with what good will I recommend it to you to absent yourself from mine. Pet. Come, come, Michael, it is not in your nature to bear malice. I am sure you'll say a kind word to the Czar for your friend, poor old Peter. Mic. Well, upon second thoughts, I will say for you to the Czar Demetrius just as many kind words as you said for me to the General Suiski. Pet. No, no, no. Forgive and forget. Don't condemn me for one ill deed, think of the many good ones I have done. Mic. I have been thinking of all your deeds, and I protest to you I can't recollect one good one amongst them all, unless it was your obliging introduction of me to your catchpoles, and I will repay that favour by the very civil manner in which I'll recommend you to the hangman. Pet. Now I'm sure you can't be serious, Michael. You wou'd not, surely you wou'd not suffer your wife's father to be hang'd, and see yourself made son-in-law to the gallows? Mic. Don't be too sure of that. I may have family connections in that quarter more than you may be aware ofâAs for Petrilla, a trifle of that sort can make no difference between her and me. Petrilla enters. Pet. Ah, here she comesâSweet, sweet Petrilla, soften the heart of this obdurate man. I only want him to sue out my pardon from the Czar Demetrius, and because I made a small mistake about the star upon his cheek, and other little matters, he vows vengeance against me, and has no pity in his heart for your poor old father. Petril. Oh yes, he has a great deal of pity. You told me so yourself, didn't you, Michael? Mic. I did: I told you I had abundance of pity; and what was your answer to that?ââSo has a tiger.â Petril. Well, if it was; I won't marry a tiger, I can't love a tiger. Mic. I don't expect you to do both; therefore, as long as love lasts, we'll not think of marriage. Petril. Choose. I can live without you. Mic. Where can you live without me? In a Tartar's hovel, and feed on mare's milk? Petril. On the mare herself, rather than with the richest noble in the land, who has no mercy in his heart. But fear nothing, father; Michael is only jesting with you; you are in no danger. Have I contributed to raise Demetrius, and will Demetrius not protect my father? It is impossible. Mic. Well, well! Say no more. Your father is but a tailor, and Demetrius won't think about him; so let him strike work, shut up shop, and come and live with us. Give me your hand, Peter; all is over; set your mind at rest. A Tartar Soldier enters. Tart. Are you Michael Merowitz? Mic. I am Michael Merowitz; but you might have gain'd that information at the door, without troubling yourself or me to come any further. Tart. I am bearer of the Czar's commands to Michael Merowitz, and shall deliver them to no one but the principal. Mic. Why then, consistently with your duty, you may deliver them to me. What are they? Tart. You must come to the palace forthwith, âyou and one Peter Bassovitz, and his daughter Petrillaâperhaps these are the partiesâ Mic. You are right again: that is Peter Bassovitz, and this is his daughter. Tart. So I shou'd suppose: I cou'd not easily have mistaken one for the other. It is his Czarish Majesty's commands, that you present yourselves at the palace without delay: you will be admitted upon giving in your names to the gentleman-usher. Mic. I am glad to hear the usher is a gentleman âthat is not your office, I perceive? Tart. It is not. You have all heard the summonsâ Mic. Distinctly, and will obey. Tart. See that you do. Farewell! [Exit. Mic. See that you do! Is that your phrase? When next we meet again, I'll make you find a better, see if I don't. Petril. Michael, is this courtly personage, that the Czar has sent to you, one of the lords of his bedchamber? I don't think his message promises any great promotion. Pet. Are you sure he mentioned me in his majesty's invitation? Mic. Quite sure. Your name was upon the card; you have a ticket for the entertainment. Pet. I should not have taken it amiss if he had left me out. Petril. For my part, though I have little to expect, I have nothing to fear. I answered firmly to the appeal of the deacon Otreneif, I'll not run away from the summons of the Czar Demetrius. Mic. Right! my gay girl. With a man of courage you are safe; cowards only can be cruel, and my comrade Griska has the spirit of a lion. Therefore, come along, both of you, and fear him not. He is merciful to his enemies, and cannot be unmindful of his friends. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. A Chamber in the Palace. Demetrius and Maria meet. Mar. Joy to my son! I press you to my heart. Dem. Ah, my thrice honoured mother, now, behold, Justice has laid blind fortune at your feet, To make atonement for the wrongs she did. Restored once more to these imperial walls, Seat of your ancient splendour, I conjure you Cast off these sable weeds, and reassume Your dignity and freedom. Time, that's past, Hath left a long arrear of happiness To be discharg'd by time, that is to come. Mar. That will demand some caution on my part. Habits and forms when sanction'd by the church, Must not be rashly thrown aside and chang'd. Dem. We will preserve all reverence for the church, Nor wound your feelings, nor insult its forms; But shall the mother languish in a cell, And the son dwell in palaces? I trust The church will not impose that form on me. Nature protests against it. Mar. Ah! my son, He that relies on Nature for his guide, May be betray'd into unwary steps. Let Nature call experience to her aid; Hear what the Patriarch counsels. Dem. I revere The Patriarch as a father and a friend, I honour him as patron of my right. But will he tell me not to set you free From a compell'd restraint? I will not hear The man, that counsels me to be unjust, I will enjoy that liberty of soul, Which teaches gratitude, compassion, love, And the free exercise of those affections Whence all the human charities derive. I've spared Suiski: I have left him free. Shall I be gentle to my enemy, And harsh to my own parent? Heaven forbid! Irene enters. Iren. Acknowledged monarch of this mighty realm, I come, as bound in honour, to avow, That I have forfeited the word I pledg'd, And you with generous confidence believ'd, Suiski has deceiv'd me; he has drawn Your army from their duty, he advances Upon your capital, and, having sworn Allegiance to your person, seeks your life. Dem. I am not unprepar'd to meet his treason; But, pondering in my thoughts the dreadful scenes Which must ensue, if he persist to bring Your party to an issue against mine, Though conscious of my right, I hesitate And pause upon the word, that must decide Your fate, and that of thousands in your cause. Iren. I have conjured Suiski to desist From stirring up rebellion in my cause, And to my ruinâOh! for mercy's sake, Let not the crime of spilling guiltless blood Fall on my conscience: save me from that sin; Rather than that, at peril of my life, Set me between the armies ere they join, And let my abdication be proclaim'd, And heralded aloud to either host: Then if Suiski will not sheath the sword, I stamp him traitor to the nation's peace. Mar. Princess, and you my long-lamented son, If to allay this discord of the time Be, as I'm sure it is, your generous wish, And both are with like charity inspir'd To seek the general peace, and in nothing, Except in virtue, rivals, what remains To secure this object, but to join your hands, And, blest yourselves, resolve to bless mankind, To spare th' effusion of a nation's blood, And save your else devoted subjects? Dem. Ah, my good politic mother, well I know 'Tis so that marriages are made in courts. But though the joining of our hands wou'd be The reconcilement of the nation's feuds, Irene's hand, without Irene's heart, Though it gave peace to others, cou'd not give it To me, who wou'd not fetter her free choice Were it affianc'd, as I fear it is, To the worst enemy I have on earth. Iren. No enemy of yours can be my choice. Dem. No friend of mine can be the foe of peace, And that Suiski is. Iren. I do renounce him. Mar. What then remains? Why do ye stand and pause, And let the Heaven-vouchsaf'd occasion pass, When the next hour may float your streets with blood? Dem. Paint not the peril in such threat'ning terms; But for my claim, the throne unshar'd by me Had been Irene'sâAs for Theodore, Neither endow'd with talents or ambition, She wou'd have found the path to glory free. And what gains she by a divided throne, Or I, who born to disappoint her hopes, What do I gain by an unwilling hand, Whilst she withholds her heart? Rather than check Her freedom in its course, let come what will I'll meet it as I mayâI will not rule O'er trembling dastard slaves, nor own a wife Whose spirit is not tow'ring as my own, Whose choice no policy directsâBut hark! That warning speaks no courteous visitor.</field>
