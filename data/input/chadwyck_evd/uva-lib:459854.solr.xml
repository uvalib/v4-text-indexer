      <field name="fulltext">Love's Triumph. AN OPERA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO Thomas Frankland, Esq;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Persons Represented. MEN. Liso, an Italian Shepherd, inclin'd to Roving, courts Licisca, having been slighted by Eurilla, Signior Valentino, who sings in Italian. Olindo, a Shepherd, ill-us'd by Licisca, and still in Love with her, tho' he courts Eurilla, Signiora Margarita de L'Espine. Neralbo, a merry, amorous Shepherd, in Love with Serpetta, Mr. Leveridge. WOMEN. Licisca, a fickle Shepherdess, loves Olindo, and countenances Liso, Mrs. Tofts. Eurilla, in Love with Liso, and constant, tho' neglected, The Baroness. Serpetta, an innocent Shepherdess, who would, but fears to love, Mrs. Lindsey.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The SCENE Arcadia.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Time of Action three Hours.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The SCENE is a Grove with a Green, and a Village at a Distance. Eurilla is discover'd in a Melancholic Posture on a green Bank. AIR. Eur. Spare my Sorrow, rural Pleasure! You torment me in Despair. Doleful Leisure! Barren Mountains! Lonely Groves and weeping Fountains Feed my Anguish, While I languish! Love and Liso claim my Care. Spare my Sorrow, rural Pleasure! You torment me in Despair. Liso, my wandring Lover, Still chains me, tho' a Rover. The charming Stranger gains The Prize from all our Swains. Still list'ning to his Song, We learn his softer Tongue. But oh! in vain I strive His Passion to revive; False Charms detain my Treasure, And, loving, I despair. Spare my Sorrow, rural Pleasure! Love and Liso claim my Care. Enter Neralbo singing, and in a manner dancing, without observing Eurilla. AIR. Ner. Let's laugh, and dance, and play, Dull Care defying: No Swain, that's bold and gay, Can fear denying. When Shepherds whine and pray, The Nymph is flying; How should they get the Day Who're always dying. Eur. Neralbo! Neralbo! Ner. Let's laugh, and dance, and playâ Eur. Neralbo, hear me! Ner. Dull Care defying. Eur. Neralboâ Ner. Would you but hold your Tongue, I might sing out my Song. Eur. Do you know where is Liso? Ner. I keep my Dog and Sheep; But him I do not keep. Eur. Why thus d'you answer, Shepherd? Ner. Nymph, if you want the Foreign Swain, Yonder's his Cottage on the Plainâ GoâTho' I'm sure you'll go in vain. [Aside. Eu. Tho' Passion's pressing, A Virgin's Honour bars her from Addressing. AIR. Ner. Do like the rest, Do like the best, A Lover's Heart to strike. They leer, They sneer, They Dress, Caress, And wheadle, where they like. Eur. Hard to a modest Mind the Task must prove, Yet harder to desponding Love. My Heart in Pity cheer, Ye Pow'rs, to charm him! My cold Despair Will never, never warm him. AIR. Be gay, my Eyes! Regain a Heart with Smiles! Try ev'ry Art that pleases and beguiles! But oh! in vain, I try; My Looks my Aim destroy; How hard's the Trial, In Love's Denial, To give Despair the Face of Joy? [Exit. Eurilla. Ner. Ah! poor Eurilla!âShe for Liso mourns.â The wand'ring Swain for false Licisca burns; That vain Licisca, who, the great one's way, Hunts down the Game, then slights the Prey. AIR. I love a plain Lass, Clean her Looks, sweet her Face, Easie, in wooing, Safe in pursuing. We'll not, like our Betters, of Flames keep a Pother, Stand vowing, And bowing, And cooing, And suing, And never be doing; But, as warm in our Love, we'll ne'er baulk one another. She comesâMy little Heart does skip and bound, Just like our Flock, when a fresh Pasture's found. Enter Serpetta, with a Basket of Flowers. AIR. Ser. Sweet Lillies, and Roses, I'm chusing for Posies. More Thorns we discover In chusing a Lover. Ner. Our Eyes, and our Noses, Chuse Lillies, and Roses. To please you all over, Chuse Love and a Lover.â Serpetta, stay. Ser. No, no; I must leave you, I cannot believe you. Ner. D'you think, my Dear, I would deceive you? Ser. Indeed I would, but can't believe you. Ner. To please you all over, Take Love and a Lover. Ser. My Mother told me, that you Men Speak not one Word of Truth in ten. I'm simple; yet I know full well, Since you're no Woman, you can't tell. Ner. Believe me, and try; I ne'er told a Lie. Ser. There's railing, And wailing, All Day, when we're wed. Ner. Tho' we wrangle, And jangle, All's made up abed. Duo, or two Part Song. My Dear, let us wed! I'll venture my Head; 'Tis time you were sped. Ser. My Friends bid me tarry, You Men do so vary; I wouldâbut I dread. Ner. So pretty, so airy, Say, are you not weary Of living a Maid? Ser. Tho' I am but silly, D'you think I will tell ye? No, no; I'm afraid. Ner. My Dear oneâ Ser. You'd jeer one. Ner. Relieve me. [Together. Ser. Oh leave me. [Together. No, no, I'm afraid. Ner. My Dear, let us wed, &amp;c. Ser. I would, oh! I would, but I dread. [Exit Serpetta and Neralbo. Enter Liso. AIR. Liso. A secret Joy I share, Tho' absent from my Fair, Her Sight desiring. Too happy, near my Treasure, Pain'd with Excess of Pleasure, I'm expiring. Senza l'amato ben, Non trova un di seren La mia pupilla. E Solo di quest' alma Chiamar si puo la calma Piu tranquilla. Enter Olindo. Eurilla's Coyness help'd Licisca's Art, To insnare my wav'ring Heart; Tho' without Love or Truth, the Female Rover Promises Truth and Love to ev'ry Lover. Siamo del pari traditi, amico Olindo. LiÃ§isca, che non hÃ  ne fÃª, ne amore, Promette amore e fede Ã  mille amanti. Olin. Her Falshood and Disdain, At last have broke my Chain. A nobler Passion Has conquer'd Inclinationâ You leave a Nymph, whom slow to Love you find: Would you be constant to the changing Wind? Liso. Charm'd by the fair Deceiver, I cannot leave her. Tu mi parli da Saggio, e non da amante. AIR. My fatal Charmer Chains me before her. Could true Love warm her, Gods might adore her. E una Tiranna Il mio Tesoro. SÃ² che m'inganna; MÃ  pur l'adoro. Olin. Tho' coy my Charmer, I'm chain'd before her. No Love can warm her; Yet I adore her. Enter Licisca. Lic. Shepherds, the Gods preserve ye! Olin. From false Licisca's Looks, and fatal Pow'r! Lic. Alas! poor Shepherd! are you still afraid! Am I some Asp, or Monster? Liso. Wondrous your Beauty, killing are your Darts; The Love, Delight, and Torment of our Hearts. Mostro sei di Bellezza, Aspe d'amore. Dolce conforto, e pena del mio core. Olin. Freed from th'alluring Danger, I dread it now for thee, too easie Stranger. Lic. Believe a baffled Swain, You'll never gain What he has try'd in vain. Follow me, my dear Liso. Liso. Olindo, adieu! Olindo, Adio. AIR. Lic. Kindly, kindly, thus, my Treasure, Ever love me, ever charm. But let Love still prove a Pleasure, Let the Passion know no Measure; Yet no jealous Care alarm. Kindly, kindly, thus, my Treasure, Ever love me, ever charm. [Ex. Licisca and Liso. Olin. Advice is lost on Lovers: Reason's vain. Our Ills it discovers; But ne'er ends our Pain. While we others ridicule, We in our Turns all play the Fool.â Ev'n I, Licisca scorning, Feel sometimes Love returning; Tho' for another burningâ Eurilla comesâOh! Love! by her retrieve me! Let fickle Liso gain my perjur'd Fair! To his slighted Treasure leave me, And of two Wretches make a happy Pair.â Enter Eurilla. Eur. Ah! Liso, must I lose thee? [Aside. My Pride, to try thee, might refuse thee; But my Heart did ever chuse thee: And what true Lover, For a Denial would give over? Olin. She grieves! Let me gently chear, [Aside. And tune to Peace, the mournful Fair. Peace and Joy to Love prepare. AIR. Young and Charming, [To Eur. Hearts alarming, Say, why lament you? What can torment you, Now 'tis strange! When a Lover Proves a Rover, Give him over. He relieves you, When he leaves you Room for Change. Enter Serpetta. Eur. Too late, Olindo, you advise: Love's ev'n a Folly in the Wise. All foreign Aid, like Reason, fails, When there's a Foe within prevails. Ser. Away with Grief! To help you to recover, Do as Menalcas once advis'd a Lover. [To Eur. AIR. Give way to Pleasure! Soon 'twill revive you. Love of that Treasure Should ne'er deprive you. All Day dance and play, 'Till Care flies away. Kind Mirth prevailing, No Loss bewailing, No Love shall harm you, No Flame alarm you. What burns the Mournful, but warms the Gay. Olin. The Counsel's good; yet, charming Creature, 'Twill be sweeter To crown my Love, and let a faithful Swain Ease his Torment, and your Pain. Eur. Alas! I love, and 'tis in vain. Ser. Will you talk of Love again? Olin. While I prize you, Liso flies you. Eur. Alas! I love, and 'tis in vain. Duo, or two Part Song. Eur. Him I love: No longer try me! Olin. You I love: No longer fly me! Eur. He alone commands my Heart. Olin. You alone command my Heart. Ease my Anguish! Eur. Pleas'd, I languish. Olin. Ne'er deny me. Eur. Love does tie me. Olin. Bless a Lover! Eur. Oh! give over! Olin. Mingle Pleasure with the Smart! Eur. There's a Pleasure in the Smart. [Ex. Olin. Ser. Well, let him go; and yet 'tis Pity To slight a Swain so kind, and pretty. Just so you serv'd the foreign Swain; And now for him you sigh in vain. Eur. Hurtful Caution! guiltless Fault! Needful Danger! forc'd Denial! Fatal Trial! Racking, and upbraiding Thought! AIR. Charmer, why do you fly me, Yet ne'er my Heart restore? So soon is Love no more? Oh! you in vain deny me. Your cold Disdain may try me, But Love shall still employ me, And dying, I'll adore. [Exeunt. Enter Liso and Licisca. Duo, or two Part Song. Lic. How great is the Blessing! Liso. O Joy past expressing! Both. My Charmer is loving; my Charmer is kind, Lic. Why sigh you? Liso. I languish. Lic. What Anguish?â Liso. Fond Lovers still languish 'till join'd. Lic. O giorno beato! Liso. Momento felice! Se stringer mi lice L'amato mio ben. Pray Note, That throughout the Opera what is mark'd thus âwith double Comma's in the Margent is left out. Lic. (Aside...)âOlindo to regain, âI've sooth'd and caught the roving Swain. âNow I'll be coy again.(...Aside) Lic. to Liso. But what will Eurilla say, And ev'ry Nymph and Swain On our Arcadian Plain, Should we thus our selves betray? Oh! the Thought I dread, I hate: Let me 'scape, e'er 'tis too late. Liso. Oh! my Treasure, no denying! If you leave me, see me dying. O mio Tesoro, Se m'abandonni, io moro. AIR. Lic. Dare not, oh dare not talk of Love! The Name offends me. Then hide it, or wisely remove. Tho' my Heart should approve, My Pride defends me. Liso. âLost in Wonder, âStunn'd with Thunder; âCan I believe, âIn spight of Vows, you'll Liso leave! AIR. Lic. âDo not, oh! do not talk of Vows, âPresuming Lover! â'Tis Follyâmy Anger you rouse: âReason a Change allows âWhen Love is over. Liso. Fair Delusion! fickle Mind! You're most cruel, when you're kind. When I with early Harvest feast my Eyes, Wild for the golden Joy, Smiling, like Light'ning, you surprise; And smile but to destroy. Era pur meglio, instabile Licisca, Lasciarmi nel dolor, che un sol momento Farmi gioir, perche risenti poi, Con doppia doglia, i tradimenti tuoi. Enter Neralbo. Ner. Liso, Eurilla sends meâ Liso. Imprudent Shepherd, Say no more, or you'll repent it. Ardito Servo, Chiudi il labro, Ã² t'uccido. Ner. Is Liso mad, Licisca? Lic. Oh! this is pleasant! Go on, Neralbo. Tell us what wants Eurilla? Ner. Eurillaâ Liso. Swain, give overâ [To Neralbo. Hear, my Charmer, hear your Lover. [To Lic. Mio conforto, Dammi aita, Ã² con morto. Ner. I'd tell it; but I can't. Lic. What does Eurilla want? Ner. What Liso soon may grant. Lic. Go on.â Ner. A word or two with Liso. Lic. Go, Shepherd! see the Fair! None more deserves your Care. Liso. Ah! my Licisca, when so well I love you, Say, should I leave you now, would it not move you? Non ho si poco amor perte, LiÃ§isca, Che mi lasci partir senza cordoglio. Lic. You think me jealous sure. Go, Liso, you're secure. AIR. Go, Shepherd! you're a Rover. This needless Art give over. Deny your Heart no more; Nor hide your Passion, The prudent Fair and Lover, Each other's Slips discover, Yet love on as before; 'Tis now the Fashion. [Exit Licisca Ner. Now sure you'll let me go. Liso. No. Ner. I'm gone. Liso. Pernicious Messenger!â Perfido Messaggiero. Ner. What have I done? Liso. By thy presuming Tongue, The greatest Wrong. D'ogni tormento mio cagion tu sei. Ner. Eurillaâ Liso. What? again! Che vuoi dir? Ner. I say no more. Liso. Go, tell her, when her Pride and Coldness drove From her my neglected Love, 'Tis poor, to envy the Delights To which a kinder Nymph invites. What she, refusing, did restore, Is giv'n away, and mine no more. There was a Time: But 'tis too late; Nor can I think 'tis Love, but Hate. To ease us both then, say, I swore, If e'er I see Eurilla more, She this ill Usage must repair; And make Licisca ease my Care. AIR. Sweet and Gay, Like rosie May, Is the Fair; And yet her Charms may know a cloudy Day. But why should I despair? Her Smiles will Joy restore: And, when the Heav'ns are clear, Shine Brighter than before. [Exit Liso. Odimmi! In questo punto, ad Eurilla dira Ch'un vero affetto Mi contrasta le gioie al suo diletto. Dirai che amo Licisca, e che gran prova Sarebbe del suo amor se Ã  prÃ² del mio Usasse ogn' arte, e di Licisca il core Inspirasse per Liso, e fede, e amore. La crudel che mi feri Forse un di, Forse chi sa, Fedel mi sanera. Voglio Sperar, ch'Amor Tenor cangiar vorrÃ . Ne sempre del mio cor Tiranno esser potrÃ . Ner. He's mad, or deep in Loveâ'Tis all a Case; Or poor Eurilla he'd not so disgrace, Nor bid her court her Rival in his Place. I'll tell her tho'; for sure This may her Passion cure. She woo Licisca for him! Can it be? Unless she's as mad as he.â But Serpetta's coming hither,â I fear I'm as mad as either. Enter Serpetta. Ner. Heav'n the fair Serpetta bless! Ser. Kind Neralbo, you no less. Ner. For that, your Hand is all I want. Ser. Hold; 'tis what I dare not grant. A Shepherd swore As much before; Then he wanted something more. AIR. Ner. No more Trial, Nor Denial; Be more kind, And tell your Mind. So crost, So tost, I'm sad, I'm mad; Be more kind, and tell your Mind. No more then hide your good Nature, Thou dear Creature! Balk no longer Love nor Hunger! Both grow stronger, when we're younger; But fall, and pall at last, If long we fast. No more Trial! Be more kind, and tell your Mind. Ser. I'm asham'd;âThus do not ply me. Ner. Why do you turn? Thus do not fly me. Ser. I am told, I still should fly him, [Aside. And deny him: But, I vow, I can't tell how. AIR. My poor Heart says, dally, dally, Shall I, shall I? Prethee, Shepherd, ask no more. I one Day may love you well: I cannot tell. I have never lov'd before; Prethee Shepherd ask no more. Ner. Oh! I mustâ Ser. Oh! pray forbear! Ner. Who can forbear? Ser. See the Nymphs and Swains appear.â [To him. I grew weaker; he grew stronger;â [Aside. Oh! 'tis well they stay'd no longer. Enter Licisca, attended by many Shepherds and Shepherdesses, who advance, and place themselves on both sides the Stage; the Music playing a March all the while. Lic. Shining Days, and cooling Gales; Flow'ry Plains, and fruitful Vales, Leasie Shades; Groves and Glades, Prattling Ecchoes, Verdant Hills, Warbling Birds, and murm'ring Rills; Bleeting Flocks, and springing Joy, Here the Nymphs and Swains employ. AIR. Tho' to conquer, proud Love is preparing, Still be daring! Defie him! Never fly him! He pursues you, the more you're retiring: But retires, when Reason does arm you: When with Pride and with Art 'tis conspiring, What can harm you, Tho' Love should alarm you? A Shepherdess Sings. Gay, kind, and airy. Sweet is a Lover. Sweet is a Lover, Gay, kind, and airy: But when we marry, Too soon we vary, Courting, And sporting, Are over. The Chorus of Shepherds and Shepherdesses repeat the Song. A DANCE. Duo, or two Part Song. Ser. Blest with Freedom, Peace, and Leisure, What is sweeter than our Pleasure? What is sweeter? Ner. Love will show you, Love will show you, dearest Creature, Love will show you what is sweeter. A DANCE. A Shepherdess. Now is the time for sporting; Be here no Love, no Care, No formal Courting! Here gaily time employing, We none to Sorrow spare, Each Hour enjoying. Now is the time for sporting! Be here no Love, no Care, No formal Courting! The Chorus of Shepherds and Shepherdesses repeat the Song, while some others dance to the same Tune. [Exeunt. The End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. The SCENE is a Grove. Enter Licisca. AIR. Lic. Wanton Rovers, Winds now sporting, Ev'ry Leaf and Flow'r you're courting! Taught by you, let me be ranging! What so sweet as ever changing. Enter Liso and Eurilla. Liso to Eur. Bright Nymph, alone your Coyness blame. What you refus'd, oh! cease to claim; But see, Licisca! [spying Licisca.] I retireâ [Going. Ecco Licisca. Eur. Oh! rather let me here expireâ Liso [to her.] I dare not stayâ At least I'll not be seen. [Apart. Non posso piu tardar. [Liso withdraws to the side of the Stage. Eur. He's gone!âBeat gently, jealous Heart! Once let me act a double Part; Try if to Liso she'll be kind, And seek for what I dread to find. Lic. [aside.] Eurilla, here! I'll please my self, unseen, with her Despair. AIR. Eur. advancing. In my Breast what Disorder so rages! Now fearing, Now daring, My Heart I betray. Love it self against Love now engages. Yet there's something my Torment asswages: 'Tis a Pleasure in Love to obey. Lic. [to her.] Dear Eurilla, once be kind! Say what Thought employs your Mind! Eur. Oh! Licisca, I would say it; But you'll chide, if I betray it. Lic. Let your Fear be at an End; When I chide, 'tis like a Friend. Eur. Liso loves you. Lic. I know it. [With a scornful Smile. Eur. Sure so admir'd a Swain Can never love in vain! Lic. I like his Dress and Air. He pleases,âwhen he's near. Liso. O happy Fortune! [Apart. Sorte felice! Eur. Lisoâ Lic. Say on! Eur. I'm lost! [Aside. Lic. What of him? Eur. You like him!â Liso. What will she say? [Aside. Che mai dira? Eur. Will you not then crown his Love? Lic. Hold, jealous Nymph, too far you move. AIR Remember, Dissembler, You may repent too late! Then be not so daring. Should you be left despairing, How sad will be your Fate. Remember, Dissembler, You may repent too late. [Exit Licisca. Eur. Oh Love! the stronger when you're crost, Why never truly known 'till lost! [Aside. Liso. [advancing.] Slighted once, now lov'd, I grieve. Alas! I've only Thanks to give. Eur. Ah! Shepherd, could you know Who best does love you, True Flames alone would move you. Why would you go For one unkind Denial? Passion should stronger grow By such a Trial. How humbly you addrest me! How fondly you carest me! You sigh'd, you vow'd, you prest me; And swore, would I approve, You'd ever, ever loveâ You turnâyou're silentâCruel Fate! Am I then your Scorn, or Hate! Hate is Deathâoh! soon declare it! Scorn is worseâno Heart can bear it. AIR. Liso. Why are you kind too late? My Heart is mine no more. Why was it not my Fate To warm your Breast before? Again I might adore. Why are you kind too late? My Heart is mine no more. [Exit Liso. Avrei di lei pietÃ , Se non chiedesse amor. MÃ  non Ãª crudeltÃ , Quando che niega un cor, Donar quel che non hÃ . Se non chiedesse amor, Avrei di lei pietÃ . Eur. He's gone!âhe's lost! for ever fled! Reason, Pride, or Rage retrieve me! Love, oh! leave me! Why d'you live, when Hope is dead! Enter Serpetta. Ser. Eurilla grieving!âMournful Fair, Let me strive your Heart to cheer. Eur. Oh! leave me, leave me! You but grieve me. AIR. Oh Love, now Hope's no more, Cease to torment me. Death, or Madness, I implore. Fate will ne'er my Ease restore, Nor Life content me. Oh Love, now Hope's no more, Cease to torment me. [Exit Eurilla. Ser. And is this the end of wooing! Leering, bowing, Swearing, vowing. Dying, lying, sueing, cooing, Long pursuing, and undoing! Rather than I'll so be curst, I'llâI'llâI'll consider first. AIR. If ever 'tis my Fortune To play the Fool, and love, I'll have no idle Courting; But fooling on, and sporting I'll ev'ry Hour improve. [Exit Serpetta. Enter Licisca. Lic. Tho' new Adorers swell our Train, We hate to lose the meanest Swain. So, tho' I pleas'd my Pride a-while With fond Olindo's Pain, 'Twill now be sweeter, with a Smile, My Rebel to regain. He comesâ Enter Olindo. Lic. Indeed, Olindo, I must chide you. Perhaps too long I try'd you. But should you, tho' unkind I prov'd, Ill-use the Woman once you lov'd? Olin. Vain trusting Heart, would you believe her? Rather deceive the fair Deceiver. [Aside. AIR. Form'd to charm, lovely all over, [To her. You wound a Lover In ev'ry Part. But we recover, When we discover There is a Rover Within your Heart. Luc. Dull Swain, what Lightness you mis-call Is Prudence in a gay Disguise. Since so soon Desire does pall, A wanton Air allures you all; To try your Minds is to be wise. AIR. How inviting, how smiling a Rose is, When her Charms in the Bloom she discloses! So a Woman, 'till changing her State. But when Man of the Treasure disposes All her Sweets with her Freedom she loses. In Confinement how sad is our Fate! [Lic. is going. Olin. [To her.] Stay, Charmer, StayâBut oh! what am I doing! How shall I scape the smiling Ruin! [Aside. AIR. Shall I hear you? Shall I fear you? Still my divided Heart says, no. Tho' now you're smiling, Soon disdaining, You're beguiling, We complaining, Pain'd alike, if we stay or go. Lic. He's mine! The Rebel's mine again, [Aside. What easie trusting Fools are Men! But let me feignâ Swain, now you'll find [To him. I'm truly kind. Olin. Will you, will you then be kind? Lic. Take my Hand! I willâpress your Eurilla to relieve you? Olin. I'm fool'd again. But I'll feign. Enter Liso, who stops, seeing Licisca and Olindo hand in hand. Liso. Olindo false to me! Licisca falser! [Aside. Olindo traditor! Licisca infida! Duo, or two Part Song. Olin. Charmer, beguile no more. Shall I believe you? Lic. Believe me, I'll no more deceive you. Olin. With Love amus'd before, I'll be beguil'd no more. Lic. Kind Fate will relieve you, Love still has Joys in store. [Exeunt. Liso. [advancing.] If thus you treat a tender Heart, Oh point your fatal Dart, Tyrant Love, At the wild Tenants of the Grove.â Scarce by Eurilla's chilling Coldness cur'd, Then by Licisca's tempting Smiles allur'd, When my first Charmer would my Heart retrieve, I left the condescending Fair; Cruel to my self and her; Asham'd my kinder second Choice to leave: Now too late my Fault I view, Self-condemn'd, and punish'd too. AIR. While ev'ry Creature Loves free by Nature, Why to a Feature Is Man a Slave? Why vainly trying Proud Beauty flying, The more denying, The more we crave? [Exit. Se di un amante fido il premio Ã¨ questo, Vogli l'arco funesto, Tiranno Amor, a saetar le fiere. Ma se tanto severe Sono le tue ritorte Che minacciano morte, In odio anche alle Belve, Abandonar ti converrÃ  le selve. Ama felice la pecorella, Per solo' instinto, Non per amor. Ma languirebbe del pari' anch'ella, Se in Lacci auvinto Portasse' il cor. [Exit Liso. Enter Serpetta, follow'd by Neralbo. Ner. Prethee hear me. Ser. None but Fools would trust you Men. Ner. Hear meâ Ser. Don't stand leering then. Ner. Say, my Joy, Why so coy? Ser. I am not coy. Ner. Then be kind. Ser. I won't be kind.â I've a Mind To be neither coy nor kind. Ner. Would you kill me! here I swearâ Ser. Oh forbear, Don't forswearâ Ner. I'll for ever love my Dear. Ser. Don't provoke meâhere I vowâ I won'tâI won't tell you nowâ There's poor Eurilla, Liso's Love she had. See what's come on't! he slights herâshe's run mad. Ner. That's her Fault. Why did she slight him, 'Till another did invite him? Take heed! should I another woo, I shall have you do so too. Ser. Meagre Face, Void of Grace, Pray, who would run mad for you? AIR. In vain you keep a Pother! Ne'er swear you love no other! You'll ne'er beguile me more. My Heart once told me, try him. My Fear now tells me, fly him; And wisely I give o'er. [Exit Serpetta. Ner. Could the Gipsie serve me so? Could she leave me? Could she go? I'll o'ertake her, rail, and thenâ Play the Fool, and love again. AIR. Who could think we loving Noddies Would turn Woman to a Goddess, Fall before her, And adore her, And pursue her up and down! Yet, enslaving Minds and Bodies, For the Toy, False, or coy, We hang, or drown. [Exit Neralbo. Enter Liso. AIR. Liso. Love, oh spare me! Now kindly cheer me! Grief attending, Tho' offending, I Aid implore. Do not try to be tormenting! Still lamenting, And repenting, I can ne'er be punish'd more. Eurilla, injur'd Fair, Now I true Love by false compare, How I prize thee! How, Licisca, I despise thee! I for Eurilla now would live. But can I hope she will receive me? I can ne'er my self forgive. Can I hope she will forgive me? Non piÃ¹ guerra, alato Dio. Il cuor mio Chiede pace, e vuol pietÃ . Pur se vuoi darmi tormento, Solo basta il pentimento D'una ingiusta infedeltÃ . Eurilla, a te mi porto, Dell' error mio pentito. Che Licisca infedel, Con havermi tradito, Mi rende il primo amore; E vuol che torni al suo bel centro il core. Enter Eurilla in Disorder, as distracted, deck'd with Flowers. Liso starts, unseen by her. AIR. Eur. Where's my Rover? Can he fly me? Were he nigh me, I'd warm his Heart. Love would move him with innocent Art. Grief and Pity kind Love would impart. Dear Delusion, still deceive me. Like my Reason, Life may leave me; Love and I will never part. [She starts, spying Liso. Ha! he's by me. Liso. Amazement! Che sento! Eur. Liso, by Charon ferry'd over! Hold, perjur'd Lover! Th'avenging Furies I discover. Ah, Liso! to these Shades has Fate now sent thee, More to torment me? Liso. Alas! she is delirious. Ah che delira Eurilla! Eur. Fly, my Treasure, Fly to your upper World again! Tempt not our Elyzian Plain. Danger's near you. Cerberus will tear you. Hear him!âAh me! how's he growling! Hark! how he's howling! The wakeful Fiends alarming! Ha! now they all are arming. Ye Pow'rs, your Aid I'm craving. How shall I save him! The Fiends are raving. Ah me! I no Help discover. Liso!âFuries!âgive over!â Spare me, spare my Lover. Liso. How she wounds me, And confounds me! Mi scoppia il cor nel petto. Eur. Fear not! The Danger's over. Liso. Oh! Torment! Che pena. Eur. Give me your Hand. Liso. With yours, and Pardon, bless [Kneeling. Your Fond repenting Lover! If e'erâ E con la destra ancora, Concedimi il perdono. Se giÃ â Eur. Hold! Hope and I are dead. Why would you move me? AIR. Again you say you love me. Charmer, I live again. None ever lov'd above me. None suffer'd greater Pain. But now my Fears are over. A Treasure to recover Is sweeter than to gain.â Hold! tempt the Dead no more.â[She starts suddenly. Liso. Oh! you're not dead; but I with Pain am dying. Unless Heav'n my Joy restore, My Soul is flying. No, chÃª morta non sei: Ma tu mi vuoi far morir di tormento, Se non cessano ancor i sdegni tuoi. Duo, or two Part Song. Liso. Give o'er, Charmer, give o'er! Eur. Oh! grieve no more! Oh! grieve no more. Liso. Forgive me. Eur. I do. Liso. Kind Heav'n, to relieve me, Your Peace must restore. Give o'er, Charmer, give o'er.â Liso. PietÃ , cara, pietÃ . Eur. Non piangere, no. Liso. T'offesi. Eur. LÃ², sÃ². Tutti due. Ma fida per sempre quest' alma sarÃ . Eur. Ah! now with Envy burning, The Furies are returning. Liso. Take, take me to your Arms. Now, now I'm safe from Harms. To Love a Right is given, Spight of infernal Foes, To share the Joys of Heav'n. [Exeunt. Vieni fra le mie braccia, amata Eurilla; Che nasconder vogl'io. Tra le ombre dell' Inferno il Paradiso. Enter Olindo. Olin. âLove, that false and wandring Light, âLeads astray, then leaves in Night; âSo Licisca, to deceive me, âBrought me hither but to leave me, âYet no Reason can retrieve me. AIR. Vain is my Art; Lost is my Heart. I draw the Dart in vain. Poor suffering Heart, oh bear it. The more I strive to tear it, The greater is my Pain. âShe returns. Again I tremble. âHeart, recover, or dissemble. Enter Licisca. Olin. I sought Eurilla round the Plain. Olindo's Care would be as vain, Should he seek your Love again. Lic. Hold, wav'ring Swain! Would you play the Fool again? Olin. No; like the Wise, Love I'll vary, or disguiseâ [Aside. Hark! I hear a lively Measure; The Swains appear With the Fair, Their Joys I'll share. Love adieu, and welcome Pleasure! Enter Shepherds, Shepherdesses, and others, who place themselves on both sides the Stage, the Instruments playing to 'em as they march. Olindo and Licisca mix with 'em. Olindo comes forwards, and sings. AIR. Olin. Swains, wing the Day With Songs and Dances! Cares fly away, When Sport advances. Let all be gay; But while you play Beware of fatal Glances. [Looking towards Licisca smiling. CHORUS of Shepherds and Shepherdesses. Swains, wing the Day with Songs and Dances. Cares fly away, when Sport advances. Let all be gay; but while you play, Beware of fatal Glances. A DANCE. Licisca comes forwards, and sings. AIR. Lic. Lovers, discover no Sorrow! Kind Fate may smile to Morrow, If you but smile to Day. Gay Folly may content us: Grave Humours but torment us. The happy are the gay. [Looking towards Olindo smiling. A DANCE. AIR. Olin. No Sorrow we discover, When Beauty smiles, 'tis over. Alike we love and play. Fate may a-while ill-use us: But, what one Moment loses, Another will repay. [Looking on Licisca, as if it were to answer her. AIR. Lic. Delights all around Smile on our Leisure. Joys abound, And know no Measure. So may Pleasure, Ever sporting, Grow transporting! Like the Spring, Love smiles to bless us. Lest it cloy, Change the Toy, New Sweets caress us. CHORUS as before, some dancing at the same time. Swains, wing the Day with Songs and Dances. Care fly away, where Sport advances. Let all be gay; But while you play Beware of fatal Glances. The End of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. The SCENE a Grove. Enter Eurilla. Eur. Is he then mine! and shall this Hour See us join'd, by Hymen's Pow'r! Oh! what Joys his Vows dispence! I doubt my weak revolving Sense. Wild with Joy, as once with Grief, Sure Madness proves its own Relief, And I my self deceive. Yet flatter on, dear waking Dream! Since you give Pleasure in extream, Why should I not believe. AIR. Kind Hope, thou Dawn of Pleasure, Arise! and return, With my Treasure! Arise and return. Reviving and smiling My Sorrow beguiling, Allure me! Secure me! Oh! should you deceive me, And leave me, Too soon I may mourn. Enter Olindo. Olin. Like me, Nymph, forbear to grieve! False Liso to Licisca leave. He now invites The Swains, to grace their Nuptial Rites. To be reveng'd, let's only change our Chain. They most will lose, when we each other gain. Eur. Are you, Swain, Very sure of what you say? [Smiling. Olin. I know he weds to Day, And sure 'tis the perjur'd Fair. Hymen's Priest, The Bridal Feast, Will soon attend 'em here. Then let us not delay. Eur. You're not sure of what you say! Olin. Can you, when disdain'd, be gay? Eur. Go, Swain! your Licisca see! She may be more disdain'd than we: But I can ne'er unconstant be. AIR. Fond Love has gain'd my Heart. I burn, and bless the Smart; Never, never address me. In vain you would possess me. He reigns in ev'ry part. My Chains no more oppress me. Love guards me with his Dart. The Tyrant has the Art With Pain to bless me. [Ex. Euril. Olin. How my Flame with Hope returns! I'm blest if Liso for Eurilla burns. My Tyrant comesâI'll seem now to disdain her; I must fright her Pride, to gain her. Enter Licisca. Olindo advances, and sings to her, smiling. AIR. Olin. An Air, a Shape, a Face A-while may charm me. But there's a nobler Grace That must disarm me. From Beauty soon declin'd Love is removing. But, nourish'd with the Mind, Lasts, still improving. Lic. Well, Olindo! then you find Your lov'd Eurilla kind? Olin. She's kind, where her Love is due; And must be happy; since she's true. Had Liso, Nymph, been so with you? This Day they wed. Lic. What do I hear! Oh! Despair! Does he leave me, And deceive me? AIR. Olin. Be wiser! ne'er betray us, If you'll not be betray'd: True Love repay us, Or be with false repay'd. My Heart true Passion prizes; But nobly Love despises, When made a common Trade. Be wiser! ne'er betray us, If you'll not be betray'd. [Exit Olindo. Lic. Be wiser! ne'er betray us, If you'll not be betray'd! How insulting grows a Lover, When his Rivals give over! Now I'm afraid I neither shall recover. But he comes, the perjur'd Rover. Oh! now I feel, Olindo's Scorn resenting, How Disdain is tormenting. Enter Liso. Liso. Charming Licisca. [To her. Vaga Licisca. Lic. [Aside.] O my Heart! I am reviving. Olindo may repent the Arts he try'd. Tho' lov'd, 'tis dang'rous to provoke our Pride. Liso, my Joy, [To Liso. When kindly you're returning, Shall I be coy, Your tender Passion scorning? No. Let no more Disdain our Hearts dissever; But Love and Hymen join our Hands for ever. Liso. Here is my Hand. Ecco la destra. Lic. With mine my Heart I give you. No Pow'r but Death shall force my Soul to leave you. Liso. But what will Eurilla say, And ev'ry Nymph and Swain On your Arcadian Plain, Shou'd we thus our selves betray? Oh! the Thought I dread, I hate. Let me 'scape, e'er 'tis too late! Ma Eurilla che dirÃ ? Che dirÃ  tutta la nostra Arcadia Di Licisca e di Liso? Dunque si pensi meglio. Lic. Oh! my Treasure, you afright me. Let kinder Love to Joy invite me. AIR. Liso. Dare not, oh! dare not talk of Love, The Name offends me. Then hide it, or wisely remove. Tho' my Heart shou'd approve, My Pride defends me. [Exit Liso. Taci! ne mi parlar d'amor: C'hora non voglio. Le faci nascondi del tuo cor. Ch'un tiranno rossor Mi fa di scoglio. Lic. With my own Words derided! Left with Scorn! Oh! how my Breast with raging Passion's torn! Too late my Fault I mourn. Ye Pow'rs, relenting, Oh! punish me no more. While I my Fate deplore, Too late repenting, Each Passion is a Fury most tormenting. AIR. Fond Moments, false Pleasure, Love Follies, vain Treasure, Ah! how dear you cost! A Trouble When tasted, A Bubble When wasted; A Pain when you're lost. Ne'er contented, Tormented, And tost; Or slighting, or slighted we're crost. [Ex. Licisca. Enter Serpetta and Neralbo. AIR. Ner. Now, my Dear, All is clear, And our Friends agree and join. Let me know, E'er I go, Must I hang, or are you mine? Ser. Why so fast. Why in haste? Both, my Friend, may come at last. Ner. Let me taste, Or I'm cast! Better hang, than ever fast. Lose me not then by your Hate; Tho' 'tis true I am not cruel. We love too soon, or you too late, When we've wasted all our Fuel. AIR. Ser. You're so pretty, Airy, witty, 'Twere a pity We shou'd part. I cou'd love you, And approve you, Were I sure I had your Heart. But soon Cooling Follows fooling: Shou'd you leave me, Or deceive me, For my Folly I shou'd smart. [Going. Ner. Stay! E'er you leave me; Hear, and believe me.â Cruel, since you'll not be mine, I'll go drownâmy Love in Wine. AIR. You scorn a tender Heart; Too soon you'll want it. You'll play the loving part When none will grant it. Soon you'll want it. None will grant it. Then wisely be complying; My Love no more denying. Let's use our Prime! Lose no Time! 'Tis flying. You scorn a tender Heart, &amp;c. [Going. Ser. Oh! Stay! Thou shalt not hangâI wou'd refuse thee; But with fooling I might lose thee. Ner. As for hanging let that pass! Did you think me such an Ass?â Enter Liso and Eurilla. Ner. to Ser. But see Eurilla now her Love possessing! Long, happy Pair, enjoy, and prize your Blessing! [To them. Duo, or two Part Song. Liso. When I am ranging, Eur. When I am changing, Both. May Lions prey on my Flock and my Heart! Eur. With Love I'll kindly chain you. We'll never, never part. Liso. All possessing, when I gain you, Each Hour will Love impart. Both. Transported, to obtain you, Ever join'd, Ever kind, I bless the Dart. Eur. Ch'io non l'adori! Liso. Ch'io la tradisca! Eur. &amp; Lis. Pria mi saeti, mi fulmini il ciel! Eur. Porta nel volto vago L'Idea di fedelta. Liso. Ne piu vezzosa imago Amor formar non sÃ . Tutti due. E cede i suoi splendori Chi non hÃ  il cor di gel. Ner. I'm glad you so agree. You're pleas'd, and so are we. None grow so true in Love As we who us'd to rove. A-while abroad we taste; But feast at home at last. Liso. Now ready, by my Care, The Nuptial Pomp will soon attend my Fair. Sure the greatest Glory's due, To grace the Triumph of a Love so true. Andiamo, cara Eurilla; Dove l'Arcadia tutta Con solita pompa vuol celebrar La tua costanza &amp; vuole Che si vegga in Trionfo oggi il mio sole. Duo, or two Part Song. Liso. Come, my Charmer, now to bless you Love and Hymen shall combine. Eur. I am blest, since Love does press you, Charming Shepherd, to be mine. Liso. Vieni, Ã´ bella, vieni e godi Che ora Ã¨ tempo di gioir. Eur. Fido il piÃ¨, fido il cor mio, Caro sposo, avrai con te. Ser. There's more Pleasure to possess you, Than our Neighbours have to join. Ner. I hope better to caress you, Tho' my Courtship's not so fine. Liso., Ner. Come, my Charmer, now to bless you Love and Hymen shall combine. [Exeunt. Enter Licisca. AIR. Lic. Ne'er complain, tho' ne'er contented, Hearts, who never Love obtain'd More severely we're tormented, When we're lov'd, and then disdain'd. Ne'er complain, tho' ne'er contented, Hearts, who never Love obtain'd. I hop'd by Liso to recover Olindo, whom my Pride remov'd. Oh! 'till I'd lost that injur'd Lover, I ne'er knew how well I lov'd. Too late my Folly I discover, Let my Grief by Death be prov'd. Enter several Shepherds and Shepherdesses, who cross the Stage, singing and dancing. Chor. Love and Hymen are combining. Call all Nature to rejoice; And applaud the Lover's Choice. Ever shining, Still refining, Like the Sun the World adorning, May their Joys be still returning. Love and Hymen are combining. Call all Nature to rejoice. [Exeunt Shepherds and Shepherdesses. Licisca alone. Lic. Ah! cruel Joy! I'm punish'd over Measure; With my Sorrow, and their Pleasure. Oh break my Heart! or ease me, Fate! Olindo's lost: There's nothing now can please me, O Death, when Life I hate, Why so slow to ease me? AIR. Why vainly am I calling! Slow Death I'll wait no more. I now am falling. Oh! cou'd he, whom I tormented, Know how I now repent it; How I my Fault deplore, I shou'd die contented. Why vainly am I calling? Slow Death I'll wait no more. I now am falling.â [Going.

To a fond Lover Permit his eager Haste! Ye envious Trees, then ne'er repine! No more my Charmer hide. Like Clouds, ye leafy Shades, divide, And let her Glory shine! In si bel giorno, Volan d'intorno, Ai nostri cori, Gratie, ed amori. En elle selve, L'istesse Belve Provan l'ardori Di noi pastori.
