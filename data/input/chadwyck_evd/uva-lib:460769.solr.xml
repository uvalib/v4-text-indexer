      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene First. —Fairy Land—Queen Mab, Fairies. Chorus —“Who would sleep in her coral cave?”—Finale Second Act, “Oberon.” Welcome queen of the Elfin band; Thou art welcome back to fairy-land, To the land of music, the land of mirth, And joys unknown to the sons of earth. Merrily, merrily let us sing, Round as we trace the fairy's ring. Queen. Say where the bard who in his brightest dreams, Hath not drawn inspiration from our streams; Say where the churl so dull to set no store By fairy tale, or scoff at fairy lore: If such unthankful clod on earth there be, “Pinch him, fairies, mutually, Pinch him for his villany. Pinch him and burn him and turn him about, Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.” Mother Bunch rises. M. Bunch. Then by my fay, some trouble it will cost, You'll have to pinch, and turn the world almost, For in its own conceit, 'tis grown so wise, 'Twill believe nothing, but its hands and eyes; Holding in scorn of essences ethereal, All that is not material, immaterial; My book is banished nursery and hall By knowledge which the boobies “Useful” call. The publication of the “Libraries of Useful Knowledge” had just been commenced. Useful forsooth! where finds the housewife now, Her hearth swept up? was that no use? I vow, It makes me mad! the lazy sluttish maid Now sleeps in peace, no more of us afraid— “Farewell, rewards and fairies” runs the song That now they sing, and they shall rue it long. Queen. Nay, my good mother, you are scarcely just, To the poor children of yon ball of dust; We need not whisk through key-holes as of yore, For ignorance no longer charms the door. The superstition which enslaved the clown, I grant is gone, he takes the horse-shoe down, But though our presence he no more perceives. He feels our influence on summer eves, And winter nights, and still in every clime The fairy tale is told; and lov'd the fairy rhyme. M. Bunch. Well, well, e'en as you please—I'm getting old, And grant I'm vexed when maggots grow so bold. I have a godson whom I would befriend, But that task done—my earthward journeys end. Then farewell to their world so wondrous clever, Old Mother Bunch deserts it, and for ever. Queen. We hold a feast to-night—You'll come? M. Bunch. I'll see. With me of late, late hours do not agree. Queen. Oh! here we're never late; Alluding to the early closing custom of the theatre, which I have already mentioned. Ere midnight hour The glow-worm lamps are quench'd in every bow'r, Each fairy bids her acorn shutters close, Or draws the leafy curtains of her rose. Glee—Queen Mab and Fairies—“Come unto these yellow sands.” Hasten back to fairy-land, And bring your godson in your hand, To join our band. Speed! speed! May you succeed, And back repair, Our elfin feast to share. Hasten back to fairy-land, And bring your godson in your hand, To join our band. With a fal la, la, la, la, la, &amp;c. Mother Bunch descends—Scene gradually changes to Scene Second. —The gardens of the palace of the Grand Duke of the Green Islands. Enter Grand Duke and Duchess. Duke. Sweet wife and duchess, moderate your passion, Speak with calm dignity in our own fashion; What is it of our daughter you would say? Duchess. Duke, she grows more provoking every day, And 'tis your fault. Duke. Our fault! we've no faults, madam, And we have power to pardon if we had 'em. Duchess. The girl's no sense. Duke. Well say that she has not I cannot give her— Duch. What you haven't got. Duke. Grand Duchess— Duch. Well you say such things, you do, They would provoke a saint. Duke. Then wherefore you? You should be proud, ma'am, of my daughter's beauty. Duch. I'd rather she were plain and did her duty. Duke. Her figure's formed by Medicean rule. Duch. An upright figure, but a downright fool. Duke. With eyes so bright, and voice so sweet and tuneful— Duch. And scarcely brains to fill the smallest spoonfull. Duke. You'll make me swear—A Princess rich and pretty, What earthly reason has she to be witty? She's the most lovely girl in our dominions; About that fact there can't be two opinions, At least we beg to say we think there can't be. Duch. Perhaps there can. Duke. Then, ma'am, we say there shan't be, Because who so presumes, his head shall fall, And then we'll trouble him to think at all. Besides you know full well 'tis in our power To give our daughter an enormous dower, And that's been ever found beneath the sun To be sense, wit, and talent, all in one; Nay, if such wealth should on a negro light, The world would call that black a lucky wight. (A crash of china heard) Duch. Hark! something dreadful sure must be the matter; That's from my Indian Cabinet, that clatter. Duke. 'Tis nothing! Duch. Nothing! Why, you heard that smash! Duke. I think I did hear something like a crash! Duch. Hear something like; why, Duke, I shouldn't wonder If you would make the same remark on thunder. Duke. My love, there's one small fact which you forget, I'm used to smashes in the cabinet. But here comes one will tell us what's occurred. Enter Chamberlain. Duch. Grand Chamberlain, what noise was that we heard? Chamb. Her serene highness the Princess Emeralda has been graciously pleased to overturn the porphyry table, and demolish the entire service of Nankin porcelain, presented to your highness by the Emperor. Duke. Ha, ha, ha, the gipsy has had the temerity to make war on China. Duch. What can you now, pray, in her favour plead? Duke. She has atoned already for the deed! Duch. Prove that—my anger on the instant ceases! Duke. Why, for one war she's made you fifty pieces. Duch. My best long service, trampled on for sport. Duke. Long services are oft passed o'er at court, And we remember when a tiny elf We broke a world of crockery ourself! Where is the Princess? Duch. Yonder she is racing, A butterfly or some such thing she's chasing. Music—A butterfly crosses—Emeralda appears chasing it—she disappears. Duke. Why there's a fact that will alone refute The fools who say that she has no pursuit. Duch. About an insect to make all this fuss. She ought to catch it for behaving thus. Duke. And she has caught it! look, and here she comes, Holding it twixt her fingers and her thumbs. Re-enter Emeralda with a butterfly. Air—Emeralda—“I'd be a Butterfly.” So, Mr. Butterfly! full half an hour, All through the palace you've led me a chase; What, let you go again, once in my power! Don't you believe it, my little scapegrace. No longer roving from flower to flower, Pinn'd to a paper and in a glass case, You, Mr. Butterfly, “born in a bower,” Shall find time to rest yourself after your race. Duke. Come hither, Emeralda dear, to me Emer. I've caught a butterfly, see, father, see. Duch. Can'st look me in the face, thou childish rover? Emer. Yes, madam; (looking at butterfly) and it seems all painted over. Chamb. (aside) Hem! our Grand Duchess there received a rub. Duke. (to Emeralda) A charge is made by your revered stepmother. Emer. To think it comes from an old ugly grub. Chamb. (aside) Preserve us! That's a harder hit than t'other. Duch. This is too much. Since she to listen scorns, Upon your head, Grand Duke, be— Emer. (holding up butterfly) Two great horns. Duke. Grand Duchess! S'death! The child you flurry so, You make her answers seem mal-a-propos. Come hither, love—she's shy, I'll speak to her— She minds me always—don't she? (to Chamberlain) Chamb. Always, sir! Duch. Shy—she is sulky, and you call it shyness, She never minds me—does she? (to Chamberlain) Chamb. Never, highness. Duke (to Emeralda) These childish sports you now must lay aside. The time has come for you to be a bride. Already two great princes for your hand, Through their ambassadors, have made demand. They'll soon arrive themselves, and one of these— Emer. O yes—I'll marry both, sir, if you please. Duke. Dear child! You see—she's really too obedient, To marry both, my love, is not expedient. (flourish) Chamb. Your highness!—by that trumpetting and drumming, One of the suitors must at least be coming. Duch. A suitor, and this girl in such a trim, Suit her he may, but she will scarce suit him. Trio—Grand Duke, Chamberlain, and Emeralda. “Gazza Ladra.” Duke. To her chamber quick convey her, And in richest robes array her; Let of diamonds rare, a cluster, Grace her brow, ere you to public gaze display her, And 'tis ten to one their lustre, Will by half the world at least, for wit be ta'en. Emer. Oh! in jewels and velvet and ermine, I'm going to see a fine lover! I'll be married to-day I determine, And never be scolded again! Duke and Chamb. Amid jewels, and velvet, and ermine, All her awkwardness they may look over! And such trifles will often determine The choice of a wavering swain— His own folly 'twould only discover, To see hers, through such splendour too plain! (Exeunt) At symphony of music scene disappears and discovers— Scene Third. —Grand Hall of Audience. Enter Myrtilla. Air—“My beautiful Rhine.” How very provoking two lovers to see For another arriving, and not one for me! Some nice lord in waiting, with them should there be, Let him but pop the question, he sha'n't wait for me. Enter Grand Chamberlain. Chamb. Well, fair Myrtilla, you have been seeing something of these suitors, no doubt. Myrt. Something, my lord! aye, something that beats everything to nothing. There is such a blaze of splendour in the court-yard that, if you only put your head out, it's enough to put your eyes out. Chamb. But their highnesses themselves,—have you seen them? Myrt. One-fourth of them only. Chamb. One-fourth of two suitors? Myrt. Exactly; I have seen one-half of one of them, for his cap is so beplumed, and his cloak so bedizened that from head to hip the wearer is invisible; he's a man of jewels, if not a jewel of a man, and as for his feathers —it has been, pull ostrich—pull prince, and the prince has got the best of it. Chamb. That must be Prince Finikin. Myrt. Oh yes, that's his name, there's no doubt of it. Air—Myrtilla—“Diavolo.” In golden coach reclining, With lazy lounging tooth-pick air, In gold and diamonds shining, He's dress'd with ultra care. In hopes of undermining. All rivals who to court repair, On fashion's self refining, His looks, his name, declare. Finikin! Dress and make, and air Would his name alone proclaim Finikin! Finikin! Finikin! Chamb. And what of his rival, Prince Riquet with the Tuft? Myrt. Oh, that's a jewel I have only seen the case of; his highness is boxed up in a golden litter, the blinds of which are impervious even to female curiosity. Chamb. Then the workman who made them is entitled to name his own wages. Ha! ha! ha! they must be a curious pair of princes by your account, or rather two odd ones; for one seems to be all outside, and the other all inside. Myrt. Just so. It seems as if one suitor had brought his fortune on his back, and lent the other his strong chest to travel in. (flourish) Chamb. The court approaches! I must take my place. Myrt. And keep it too, my lord, in any case. Music—“March from Bronze Horse”—Enter six Ladies of the Court, who form a half-circle opposite to the throne; six Guards-of-honour are seen, three of whom enter, and take their stations on each side of the door—Then Bronze King-at-arms, Herald, and Pursuivant enter, followed by Usher of the Green Rod preceding the Grand Duke and Duchess, who walk round the circle, and then take their seats—The Grand Chamberlain standing on the right of the Duke. Chorus —“Mountain Sylph.” Hail to the ruler of all the green isles! Superlative happiness waits on his smiles! His subjects, too fortunate, gaze and adore; He is all that is glorious, and gracious,—and more! Duke. Deeply we feel this homage to our station, So free from aught like fulsome adulation! Now introduce the Princes! let us see Those who aspire our son-in-law to be. The Usher goes to the door, and returns introducing Prince Finikin—The Prince has given a card to the Usher, who hands it to the Grand Chamberlain. Chamb. (reading). “The most high and puissant Prince Finikin, heir presumptive to the crown of Shadow-land, and knight of all the orders of the universe, on presenting himself to request the hand of the Princess Emeralda.” Prince. As lightning swift; by hope auspicious led, From climes beyond the sun I've hither sped. Duke. Your highness must be excessively tired; will you please to take a chair? Duch. What a magnificent air! Duke. What an air of magnificence. Prince Finikin— sit on our right hand, you are right welcome. Music—The Usher again proceeds to the door, and returns, preceding a rich litter borne by four Pages. Chamb. (reading a card which is handed to him by Usher) “Prince Riquet with the Tuft requests permission to throw himself at the feet of their serene highnesses.” Duke. He has permission, Wherefore this delay? Why is he not more open with us pray? The litter is opened, and Prince Riquet comes out of it—He is hunchbacked, bow-legged, with a bump over one eye, and bald headed with the exception of one tuft of very red hair. He is richly attired and wears a miniature of Emeralda about his neck. The ladies shriek and the men burst out laughing. Trio—Grand Duke, Chamberlain, and Riquet—“La Mia Dorabella.” Chamb. Ah! what a queer fellow, Oh! who can he be? He's like Punchinello, Why surely 'tis he! Duke. He is a queer fellow As e'er eye did see, I think Punchinello Less ugly than he! Riq. Go on, my good fellow But mark what I tell you. This same Punchinello, May cut short your glee. Trio. Laugh while you're/we're able. I'll/You'll turn the table? Riq. I think I may so. Duke. Why you don't say so. Riq. And since you tease me so, It doesn't please me, so I soon will let you know You go too far. Duke. 'Tis far too risible! Riq. What's far too risible? Duke. Your hump so visible, ha! ha! ha! ha! Riq. My hump so visible! I soon will let you know you go too far. Duch. Some frolic surely must be meant. Duke. Or is he to insult us sent. Prin. Speak, mis-shapen wretch, or die. Riq. Riquet with the Tuft am I, And by love's supreme command, Suitor here for Beauty's hand. Prin. Beauty's hand? ha! ha! 'tis plain, 'Tis the Beast has come again. (Six Soldiers advance) Duke. Spurn him from the palace gate. Riq. He who ventures, meets his fate. (drawing his sword) Slaves and sycophants beware! (they retire) Prince, I boast not form so fine, But my honour is as fair; Fairer it may be than thine. Purer far than thrice my love, Bright as thine my knightly sword; If thou doubtest, let this glove (flinging it down) Prove the truth of Riquet's word. Duke. How! defiance in our court, In our presence. Riq. Pardon pray— Ye have made the beast your sport. Shrink ye when he stands at bay? Laugh and welcome at my form; I can laugh as well as you, But you wake a fearful storm When you touch my honour too. Duke. Parley with the wretch were vain; Let him, if he will, remain— Son-in-law (to Prince Finikin), for such we hail thee, Haste with us thy bride to see. Madman, if no harm assail thee, (to Riquet) Thank our matchless clemency. Exeunt all but Riquet and Myrtilla, in procession through door to “March from Bronze Horse.” Riq. Humph! Rather an unfavourable commencement of a love expedition. (to Myrtilla) Well! what are you, and why do you not follow your friends? Myrt. Your highness has wit enough to know, without asking; or I'm much mistaken. Riq. By your pertness, you should be a waiting woman. Myrt. Your highness finds I prophesied.—And my motive for staying? Riq. A ruling one with all women, but with waiting women especially,—curiosity. Myrt. Your penetration, Prince, is a compliment to mine. Riq. And pray, my quick-tongued mistress, will you save me the trouble of guessing on what particular point your curiosity is excited? Myrt. Your highness's wishes are commands. You fell in love with the Princess Emeralda from a sight of her portrait. Riq. I did. The first glance of this miniature enchanted, —enslaved me. Myrt. 'Tis a good likeness I grant, and my surprise is only that your highness did not send in return as faithful a resemblance of yourself. It would have saved you the fatigue of a long journey. Riq. Ah, you mean to say—I am ugly. Myrt. That might be considered rude, sir; but your highness will no doubt admit that your features— Riq. You are rather difficult to please, I fancy, in these Green Islands. Ican assure you I deem myself, everything considered, a very fortunate fellow. Song.—Riquet. I'm a strange looking person I own, But contentment for ever my guest is; I'm by habit an optimist grown, And fancy that all for the best is. Each man has of troubles his pack, And some round their aching hearts wear it; My burden is placed on my back, Where I'm much better able to bear it. Again tho' I'm blind of one eye, And have but one ear that of use is, I but half the world's wickedness spy, And am deaf to one half its abuses: And tho' with this odd pair of pegs, My motions I own serpentine are; Many folks blest with handsomer legs, Have ways much more crooked than mine are! Nature gave me but one tuft of hair, Yet wherefore, kind dame, should I flout her? If one side of my head must be bare, I'm delighted she's chosen the outer! Thus on all things I put a good face, And however mis-shapen in feature, My heart, girl, is in the right place, And warms towards each fellow creature! Myrt. Excellent; I admire your philosophy, Prince, and admit the force of your argument; all things considered, as you say—your highness is certainly fortunate. Riq. Nay, only put this ring upon your finger, and when you have contemplated its brilliancy for a few moments, look again upon the giver, and you will find he is vastly improved, even in countenance. (gives her a diamond ring) Myrt. As I live, so I do! Why, there must be magic in the ring surely. I do think certainly that your highness is, comparatively speaking, a very agreeable-looking personage, and I will hasten and tell the Princess Emeralda what a husband she is likely to run away from. Riq. Stay! stay! the Princess Emeralda, say you—are you then one of her attendants? Myrt. Like your highness, I am her devoted humble servant. Riq. Then, my pretty mistress Malapert, you can earn a dozen such baubles, by obtaining for me one private interview with your adorable mistress. Myrt. Can't you employ me in some other service first? I should be sorry to lose your custom, Prince, and the interview, I fear, will close accounts between us. Riq. I am more sanguine—but there is no time to spare. Even now, perchance, she lends a willing ear to the addresses of my rival; act as smartly as you speak, my mirror of waiting maids, and I'll give thee a groom of the chamber for a husband, and a wedding-ring that would make a portion for a countess. Myrt. Your highness's liberality shall not be ill bestowed. Gemini, if all lovers were like Riquet with the Tuft, I'd bargain with my next mistress to take the cast-off suitors, instead of the cast-off suits. Air—Myrtilla—“La Sylphide.” On my zeal pray depend, sir, I your suit will befriend, sir, Here a moment or two, my return but attend, sir. I to seek her will fly, sir, And my influence try, sir, To bring her your features to see in your wits; What a comical figure a courting to go sure, (aside) Dan Cupid must blinder, and blinder still grow, sure, Or has changed to a hunchback his own crooked bow, sure, To frighten each obdurate fair into fits! (Exit) Riq. It does seem ridiculous in a being so formed as myself, to travel thus far in the hope of winning the loveliest of her sex. But I am urged forward by an irresistible impulse. I feel it is my fate to seek her love, and there are moments when my heart prophesies success. Oh all potent Mother Bunch, Patroness of hump and hunch. Thou who countest not as sins, Bandy legs, and broken shins. Best of godmothers, now hear me, In my hour of need, be near me. M. Bunch. (rises) Good morning, godson; (he kneels) what frightened at me! rise. Riq. No not frightened, godmamma—only a little astonished. M. Bunch. You called on me— Riq. I call'd upon your name—but I couldn't do myself the pleasure of calling on you, because I didn't know where you lived. M. Bunch. Ha; ha; thou wert ever a lively child. Riq. (aside) And you're a lively-looking godmother. M. Bunch. Don't you say anything you don't want me to hear, because it's the same to me, whether you talk to yourself or speak out. Riq. (aside) The deuce it is? M. Bunch. Yes; the deuce it is. Riq. Pshaw! I forgot again—honoured godmother, excuse my astonishment, this is my first personal interview with you. M. Bunch. Not so, Riquet—you saw me the day you were born. Riq. Possibly, but I was so very young then. M. Bunch. Mankind are always ungrateful; I bestowed a gift on you. Riq. Was it this trifling excrescence, (pointing to hump) or the little pent-house beneath the shade of which my left eye reposes? M. Bunch. Neither; nature gave you those. I gave you wit and cheerfulness by way of compensation, and prophesied that the most beautiful girl in the world should become enamoured of you. Riq. Indeed! then fulfil your prophecy—I have come hither— M. Bunch. Spare your breath—I know all—your lady love is a perfect simpleton. Riq. (producing miniature) A simpleton! with such eyes as these? M. Bunch. Yes, silly as she is beautiful—but 'tis in your power to bestow sense upon her, if she will consent to marry you. Riq. Delightful; but if she is so silly, how shall I be able to convince her that she will shew her sense by marrying me? M. Bunch. Ha! ha! very well—very well. Riq. Nay, don't laugh, dear little mother Bu—godmother Bunch, I mean, but relieve me of this hump, if only for the first interview with the Princess. M. Bunch. Nay, 'tis she herself must do that; the fairy who presided at her birth gave her the same power over the person that I gave you over the mind; win her affections, and all your deformities vanish. Riq. But she will be frightened, and run away at the very sight of me. M. Bunch. Well—well—your tongue shall have a fair chance at all events. I will give you the means of becoming invisible while you talk to her. Behold the mantle of prudence. Mother Bunch presents magic gauze cloak to Riquet. Air—“The Witches' Dance,” Paganini. This magic mantle take you! Invisible 'twill make you. Want of such has ruined wiser folks than you. When passions fierce assail man, E'en wit and talent fail man, Unless his better genius gives him prudence too! At the end of song Mother Bunch gives him the cloak, he holds it up to look at it, and she vanishes while he is so doing, down centre trap. Riq. (puts on cloak) —Well now—this is really very kind of you, I assure you I feel—Gone! excellent little woman— it would be a glorious thing for the world if all godmothers would take pattern by you—never come till they're called— then give one a handsome present and vanish. Some one approaches. Re-enter Myrtilla, running. Myrt. Prince Riquet! Prince Riquet! (she runs close past him, without perceiving him) Riq. She sees me not—there's virtue in this cloak indeed! (aloud) Myrtilla! (Myrtilla screams and turns) Myrt. What's that? who spoke? Riq. I, your friend—Prince Riquet. Myrt. Mercy on me, I can see nothing—I shall faint, and there's nobody to catch me. Riq. Be not alarmed— Myrt. I can't help it, you have made all my teeth chatter. Riq. Not I, child; that's a trick they learnt of your tongue. Myrt. Where are you? Riq. Never mind where I am; where is the Princess Emeralda, and how have you prospered with her for me? Myrt. I've no time to tell you, she is coming this way with your rival, Prince Finikin. Riq. She is! Then go and leave me. Myrt. Oh dear, oh dear; I don't know which way to go, and I don't know whether I leave you or not. (Exit Myrtilla) Riq. She comes, indeed; now mantle, be my friend. My rival's suit shall have a speedy end. (retires) Enter Princess Emeralda, followed by Prince Finikin. Fin. Turn, lady fair, vouchsafe thy slave a word, Or see him fall upon his own good sword. Emer. I don't know what to say. Riq. (who has come between them, aloud, and in ecstasy) She speaks. Emer. (starting) O dear— You needn't talk so close, sir, in my ear. Fin. Who! I?—most beauteous object of my choice, I breathed no sound. Riq. (in his ear) You did. Fin. Why change that voice So silver sweet? Emer. What do you mean by change? Fin. Nay, now 'tis as before. How very strange! But give in any tone a kind reply— Dost love me? Emer. Not a bit. Fin. But will you try? 'Twere easy, sure, with me in love to fall. What think'st thou of me? Emer. I don't think at all. Fin. Dost not admire me? Emer. I admire your dress. Fin. Wilt marry me? Riq. (aside to her) For mercy, don't say “yes!” Emer. Well then, I won't. Fin. Refused! let me be cool, I came not hither to be made a fool. Riq. (to him) No, you come ready made. Fin. Insulted! Zounds! Madam, I must say this exceeds all bounds. Emer. What ails the man? I never moved or spoke. Fin. No doubt your highness thinks it a fine joke, In a feigned voice, to say the things you do. But, princess, I will change my tone with you; (puting on his hat) And shall report your words to your papa. Riq. (knocks his hat off) In presence of a lady, chapeau bas! Fin. Confusion! Emer. There's your hat off! Ha! ha! ha! Trio—Finikin, Riquet, and Emeralda—French Air. Fin. Madam, you this deed shall rue, To your court I bid adieu. I'll declare war, I swear; Blood shall flow for this affair! Strike a man of my degree, Dearly this shall answered be! From my head, dash my hat! Heads themselves shall fall for that! Emer. What's the matter now, sir? 'Twasn't me I vow, sir, If your hat tumbles flat, What have I to do with that? Go and war declare, sir, What d'ye think I care, sir. I shall tell my papa, I won't have you—ha! ha! ha! Fin. Madam, you, &amp;c. Emer. (Together) Sir, 'tis you this rage shall rue, To our court, pray bid adieu, Go, declare war, I care Nothing for your angry air, My papa shall let you know What it is to use me so. If your hat tumbles flat, What have I to do with that? Riq. (aside) (Together) It will do! Yes, it will do! To the court he bids adieu, Go declare war, I swear, You shall have enough to spare, What! an empty coxcomb see, Threaten one beloved by me? Had your head been worth your hat, It had fallen instead of that! (Exit Finikin) Emer. Ha! ha! ha! Riq. Ha! ha! ha! Emer. O dear me! what's that? (looking about) I hear a laugh close to me, and yet I can't see anybody. Riq. Lovely princess, be not alarmed, a friend is near you who is most anxious for your welfare. Emer. (curtseying) Thank you, sir, but you have the advantage of me. Riq. And I must keep it now, or lose it for ever. Emer. I don't understand what that means, and so, if you please, I shall wish you a good morning. (going) Riq. Nay, leave me not thus, I have something of importance to communicate to you. Emer. Oh, but they tell me, things of importance are too much for my head. (going) Riq. My communication is for your heart. Emer. (returning) Oh, they haven't told me anything about that. Riq. It is in your power to become as sensible as you are beautiful. Emer. Am I beautiful, then? Riq. Assuredly you are. Emer. And am I not sensible? Riq. Not even of your own beauty: an incredible dulness in woman. Emer. I should like to know how beautiful I am, can you make me sensible? Riq. I can. Emer. Then you must be a conjuror. Oh, how I should like to see you. Riq. I fear you would not. Emer. But I'm sure I should. Riq. What makes you sure of that? Emer. You speak so kindly to me, I like your voice, and I'll lay a wager I should like you. Riq. Would the stake was your heart, and I could win it. Emer. Where have you hid yourself? Let me see you! Riq. Suppose I should be ugly? Emer. You cannot be so ugly as that horrid hunchback who came here to-day; papa says he was quite a monster. Riq. Let us confine ourselves to the principal point. Do you sincerely wish to become sensible? Emer. Yes. Riq. There is but one way—you must promise to marry me. Emer. And will that be the last foolish thing I shall do? Riq. No, the first wise one. Emer. Well, then, I will marry you. Riq. With this kiss, then, I relieve thee from the bondage of folly. (kisses Emeralda) (Gong sounds) Emeralda seems rooted to the spot. Riquet slowly exit, as characters rush on—Hurried music—The Grand Duke, Myrtilla, Chamberlain, and the whole Court, Guards, &amp;c., enter in confusion. Trio and Chorus—Myrtilla, Grand Duke, and Grand Chamberlain—“Il Barbiere.” Mute and immoveable behold her here! What can have come to thee? daughter/lady dear speak— Emer. Fears to earth my feet are pinning, Round my giddy head is spinning. Life as if but now beginning— Crowding thoughts my soul confound! (Thunder heard) Chorus. What an awful peal of thunder! As though heav'n was rent asunder! Filling all with fear and wonder. Rolling still I hear it round! Emeralda sinks into the arms of the Grand Duke. Tableau. Scene Fourth. —A romantic view of the garden, grottos, &amp;c. Enter Grand Duke and Duchess. Duke. Ourself is thunderstruck! most wondrous case. Duch. The girl is changed completely—moves with grace, Talks common sense. Duke. Uncommon sense I say. Duch. Sings. Duke. With a voice—remember that, love, pray! Duch. And is so altered from the fool we thought her, That no one now would take her for your daughter. Duke. Prince Finikin his haste will now repent. Duch. She comes this way—on something she's intent. Duke. A book is in her hand—my hopes exceeding; I shouldn't be surprised if she were reading. Enter Emeralda. My darling daughter, whence this happy change? Emer. What change, dear sir? Duke. What change? How very strange. Ar'n't you aware that a few hours ago You were—that is, folks said—pshaw! stuff, you know. Emer. Not I, indeed. Duch. To hide it where's the use, This morning, child, you were a simple goose. Duke. And now you're quite a duck! Oh, tell us pray, Where learnt you to say—what they say—you say. Emer. I know not, sir—I only know I seem As just awakened from some troubled dream. But if I'm changed, and with your approbation, I'll try to keep (curtseying) from further alteration. Air—Emeralda—“The light of other days.” The dream of other days has faded, Its misty clouds are past— My path too long by folly shaded, Is clear and bright at! last! The sun of reason o'er it rising, Sheds forth its cheering rays, And my mind the new born splendour prizing, Makes light of other days! The world itself they say is bright'ning, An age of darkness flies, The torch of knowledge fast as light'ning, O'er earth and ocean hies! How many shrinking from its burning, Regret their old dark ways, And would fain behold that gloom returning, Called “light” in other days! Duke. Grand Duchess, I shall go with rapture wild. Duch. Prince Finikin do you remember, child? Emer. No, madam. Duke. Do remember, if you can, You saw him once, a pretty little man! He has been doubly struck, if he says true, First by your portrait, love—and then by you. Duch. He sought your hand. Duke. And got it. Duch. Duke, for shame. Emer. I trust he'll pardon me, I was to blame. Duke. He'll be too happy, if you'll be his bride. Emer. Sir, 'tis my duty, if you so decide. Duke. (to Duchess) Let's seek the Prince, and tell him 'tis expedient, That he return—my daughter's most obedient. Should he be gone, I will despatch a letter, To say she's changed her mind—and got a better. (Exeunt Duke and Duchess) Emer. Prince Finikin then is to be my husband. Is he young, handsome; above all accomplished? Should he be otherwise— Enter Myrtilla. Myrt. (aside) There she is, and alone; I declare I'm all in a twitter still. She's bewitched to a certainty, and I'm not quite sure that I ar'n't too. (aloud) Madam! Emer. Myrtilla. Myrt. Your highness does know me then; I thought you had forgotten everything. Emer. I have not forgotten you at any rate. Myrt. The whole Court seem to have gone out of their wits at the idea of your highness's having come into yours; what has made you so sensible on a sudden? Emer. It is a most curious thing, Myrtilla, but I can answer every question that is put to me, except those which ask me why I am able to do so. Myrt. How very wonderful. Emer. As I told my father, I seem to have just awakened from a dream. Myrt. And now your highness's eyes are open, what are you going to do? Emer. Why, in the first place, I'm going to be married. Myrt. Well, that is generally the first purpose for which the ladies use their eyes. And to whom? Emer. To the Prince Finikin. Myrt. Oh, that'll never do, I shall lose my friend Prince Riquet's presents. (aloud) Does your highness mention that as a proof of your sense? Emer. No, as a proof of my obedience only—for I have no recollection of this Prince. Myrt. Then I have, and I should say he is, with every respect, and in every respect—a perfect—fool. Emer. Fool! Myrt. Just so, and saving your presence, if your highness marries him, you'll be the better half of a fool yourself. Emer. Myrtilla. Myrt. I said the better half, madam. (aside) She says nothing about Riquet. She can't have seen him, for she could never have forgotten that. (a dove flies across the stage and drops a letter) Bless me, madam; did you see? The dove dropped a letter; and it's addressed to you. Emer. To me! (opens it) Verses, and signed, the “invisible.” Duet—Emeralda and Myrtilla—“I am come from a happy land.” “I have sought thee beloved one To give thee my heart, I have made from thy mind the shade Of folly depart. Come, come, then haste with me, Where love's banquet waits for thee; Mine! mine! oh, lady be! Heart give for heart! Oh love hath, like faith, a power, Mountains to remove! And pain and care extinguished are By the breath of love. Hear, then, hear me, sweet, To bow'rs of joy with me retreat Cares which here we meet, Far, far above.” Emer. Who can it be from? Myrt. I know for a hundred. Emer. Pray tell me then. Myrt. Prince Riquet. Emer. Riquet—who is he? Myrt. What, don't you remember even his name? Emer. Not in the least. (Voice within) Fairies! Fairies! work away. Emer. What voice was that? Myrt. O lud, madam, I don't know, I'm sure I thought somebody said something about fairies. (gong) Scene opens and discovers a large Kitchen—Mother Bunch and Fairies cooking at various, stoves, ranges, &amp;c. Chorus—Mother Bunch and Fairies—“Macbeth.” Cook away! No delay!— Come! come! come! come! come! Come! come! cook away! Myrt. Run, madam, run! I'll use my legs, or they'll devil 'em for somebody's supper. (Exit Myrtilla) M. Bunch. (coming forward) Stay, Emeralda! do not you be alarmed—I am your friend! Emer. What is the meaning of these preparations? M. Bunch. We are cooking the bridal supper of Prince Riquet. Emer. Prince Riquet again—Who is he? M. Bunch. Riquet with the Tuft—you should know better than anybody, as you are the bride-elect. Emer. I—mercy on me! M. Bunch. Yes, you promised to marry him—this very morning—when you were an awkward simpleton—and Riquet in return for that promise made you the intelligent creature you now are. See he is here to claim the fulfilment of your pledge. (gong) (Trees and rocks close up) Enter Riquet wrapped in the invisible cloak—Mother Bunch crosses to corner. Emer. Here! where? Riq. Close beside you, lovely Emeralda. Emer. Mercy on me! whence came that voice? Riq. From the “invisible,” whose verses you sang but now. Emer. And have I promised to marry somebody, not only that I have never seen, but that I never can see? O dear, O dear! I must have been foolish indeed. Riq. I fear you would never have promised if you had seen me, and for your own sake, that promise was indispensable. Emer. What are you then? A spirit! Riq. No, a mortal like yourself—that is—when I say like, I mean as regards the mortality—for I haven't the face to say it in any other respect. Emer. You are nobly born? Riq. A prince—rich and powerful. Emer. Accomplished? or you could not have made me so. Riq. If I have not wit enough to win your heart, I shall break my own. Emer. Brave, of course? Riq. I never knew fear till now. Emer. (aside) Well, so far, I have not made so rash a promise. (aloud) Tolerably good-looking? Riq. Intolerably otherwise; and that's the plain truth. Emer. Indeed! Oh, no, you are jesting. Riq. There never was a more serious fact. It is, therefore, prudence which kept me invisible till you had sense enough not to trust to your eyes alone. Emer. As that time has arrived, why not let me see you straight? Riq. Straight! That's impossible; but see me you shall, for I have too much honour to insist upon your completing a blind bargain—only let it be by degrees; suffer me, while prudence is yet necessary, to place a bandage over your eyes, which you can remove little by little, and so become gradually accustomed to a person who, at first sight, might appear hideous. Emer. Well, if you are bent upon it. Riq. I am bent particularly. (he binds her eyes) Emer. But I am sure you are making mountains out of mole-hills. Riq. On the contrary. I have two mountains of which I would fain make mole-hills, one on my back, and the other on my left eye. (throwing off his cloack) Emer. Ah! (putting her hands up to lift the bandage) Riq. Not yet—for mercy's sake not yet—one moment, let me summon up courage to give the word—O godmamma Bunch, what will she say to me? one look will settle the business. M. Bunch. Courage, courage, boy. Emer. O lud, I declare I begin to be frightened myself. M. Bunch. And you too, Emeralda; take heart, and employ the reason Riquet has given you. What is the value, after all, of mere personal appearance? Emer. Well, am I to lift the bandage? Riq. Yes; but very slowly. Emeralda raises the bandage by degrees, occasionally starting as she obtains a view of his figure, till her eyes meeting his face, she utters a cry of horror, which makes him suddenly turn from her, and shew the hump upon his back, at which she screams, and covers her face with her hands. Riq. I told you so, godmother. It's all over with me. M. Bunch. Pshaw, are you as silly as she used to be? speak to her. Riq. Emeralda! I perceive my fate, you no longer consent to marry me. Emer. Marry you! Riq. I gave you reason, Emeralda, I thought, to treat me more kindly. Emer. My gratitude is due to you for that. Rig. But your love, Emeralda, 'tis that alone can make me happy, nay, remove the defects of person under which I now labour. Emer. I pity thee. Riq. Pity is akin to love, but it has not its magic power, I love you, Emeralda, adore you! loved you when you were graceless, mindless—and should love you now, were you even the plainest of your sex. Emer. I wish, for your sake, I could say as much—you seem to possess an elegant—nay, a noble mind. Riq. Can you not see my visage in my mind? Emer. I'm afraid it wouldn't look very handsome anywhere. Riq. Pleasant, godmamma—isn't it? M. Bunch. Courage, courage, she listens at any rate. Riq. Well, egad, she does do that. Air—Riquet—French Air. Well I know my form and my features Are not made thy breast to warm. Loveliest thou of mortal creatures, I, devoid of every charm. But I trust I still may suit thee— Marriage hath power divine— None can e'er dispute thy beauty. Wed me—and then thy beauty's mine. Emer. (aside) What a pity he's so very hideous; his manners are truly agreeable. Riq. Come, godmamma: I think we made a move then; charming Emeralda, if you could but love me a little—ever so little, just to begin with, perhaps in time— Emer. Aye, aye, “if.” Riq. Well, I said “if,” and time is not much of a beautifier in general, so hang it, love me at once, and you have no notion how it would improve my appearance. M. Bunch. Remember, Emeralda, how much you are indebted to Riquet. Love is often born of gratitude.— Come, we will wait in this grotto your decision. Sings—“O listen to the voice of love.” (Exit Mother Bunch with Riquet, into grotto) Enter the Grand Duke, Duchess, Prince Finikin, and Grand Chamberlain. Duke. Daughter, behold the prince who claims your hand; His merits now you've sense to understand. Fin. (to Emeralda) Long cherished idol, thy adorer see; Oh, look not on the ground, but look on me! Yet, no; in mercy—do not raise those eyes, Lest, in their light, thy dazzled lover dies. What mortal can be proof against their rays; My heart! my soul's on fire! I burn! I blaze. Emer. Oh Riquet! Riquet! you are ugly to be sure, but w much superior. Fini. Riquet! Duke. Why, that's the cursed hunchback that frightened me out of my presence chamber. Duch. Remember, Emeralda, you but now promised us to wed Prince Finikin. Emer. A previous promise which I had forgotten, madam, renders that impossible. All. Impossible! Duke. Impossible! It really seems to me as if she meant to say it couldn't be. Emer. Pardon me, my dear father; but it is to Riquet I am indebted for every accomplishment I now possess, and he alone has a right to my hand. Air—Emeralda—“Zampa.” Love, thy laws we must obey! My heart in vain would fly thee; All who live must own thy sway, 'Tis folly to defy thee! Though bards proclaim thee reason's foe, To thee alone I reason owe. Yes, believe the tale I tell, Too oft they have belied him. Love will ever longest dwell Where reason lives besides him! Riquet, Riquet, no more repine, My hand and heart are thine! Enter Riquet and Mother Bunch, from grotto. Duke. The girl's bewitched: marry that horrid fright. Emer. He does appear revolting at first sight; But when you see the beauty of his mind, Much less distortion in his form you'll find. And when you know the kindness of his heart, All ugliness will from his face depart. Yes, dear Riquet, your noble soul I prize, And love makes you perfection in my eyes. (gong and music—Riquet's deformities disappear) Riq. Though I praised humps when others used to flout them, Perhaps, after all, I'm just as well without them. M. Bunch. (to Myrtilla) To Emeralda is due the merit of this transformation; love has power to embellish the ugliest of mortals, but virtue and talent can alone render the most beautiful happy. Come all with me; to Queen Mab's court repair. Scene changes to the Palace of Queen Mab, in Fairy Land—Queen Mab and Fairies discovered—The Queen welcomes the characters, who retire to their seats, while Queen Mab introduces the Denizens of Fairy Land. Queen. Children of clay, we bid you welcome here. Behold the choicest spirits of our sphere; Valiant the Jack the Giant queller, Rests him in our blooming bower. Air—“See the conquering hero.” Jack enters with Giant's head, and salutes Queen. Queen. Crystal slipper'd Cinderella Fears no more the midnight hour. Air—“Non piu mesta”—“Cenerentola.” Cinderella, Prince, Page, and Sisters enter, and perform the slipper business. Queen. On Little Red Riding Hood, no greedy wolf can sup, So pull the bobbin fearlessly, and let the latch go up. Air—“Rose d'amour.” Enter Little Red Riding Hood—Offers pot of honey, &amp;c., to Mab, and curtseying retires. Queen. Beauty and her Princely Beast, Grace the ball, and share the feast. Air—“Love amongst the roses.” Enter Beauty, followed by Beast—He declares his love, she at first repulses, then pities and accepts him, and he changes to Prince; they retire. Queen. With us knightly Valentine And his brother, forest bred, Share the fairies' festal wine, And the fairies' measure tread. (Music from the melodrama of “Valentine and Orson”) Enter Valentine and Orson—Business of forest scene, shield and rope, &amp;c.—They retire. Queen. Models of the race feline, Puss in Boots, delicious rogue, White cat, fond and feminine, Swell the fairy Cat-alogue. Air—“Ding dong bell, Pussy's in the well.” Enter White Cat, preceded by Puss in Boots—they march round the stage, offer homage to Mab, and marching back again, stand. Queen. See, the Seven Champions brave, Though on earth their race be run; Here their honoured banners wave; Here they wear their laurels won. Grand March. Enter the Six Champions—St. George enters, welcomes them, they wave their banners, form in a line, and march round. Queen. Come, Riquet, and join our band, Denizen of Fairy Land. Finale—(The characters come forward) Air—Emeralda—“The Old English Gentleman.” Old friends, I've the old prayer to make, before it is too late, With your old kindness please to view this change in our old state, Our old mythology, we thought, was getting out of date, And so we've left Olympus old, and all its gods so great, For a fine old English fairy tale, all of the olden time! Now winter old brings frost and cold, we open house to all, For while we strive to please the large, we don't forget the small. Then “boys and girls come out to play,” in answer to our call And with a good old English cheer, oh, let our curtain fall, Upon this old English fairy tale, all of the olden time. Chorus. Upon this old English, &amp;c. CURTAIN.</field>
