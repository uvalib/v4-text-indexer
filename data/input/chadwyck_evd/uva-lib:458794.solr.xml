      <field name="fulltext">Prologve. Now, luck yet send vs, and a little wit Will serue, to make our play hit; (According to the palates of the season) Here is ri'me; not emptie of reason: This we were bid to credit, from our Poet, Whose true scope, if you would know it, In all his poemes, stil, hath been this measure, To mixe profit, with your pleasure; And not as some (whose throats their enuy fayling) Cry hoarsely, all he writes, is rayling: And, when his playes come forth, thinke they can flout them, With saying, he was a yeere about them. To these there needs no lie, but this his creature, Which was, two months since, no feature; And, though he dares giue them fiue liues to mend it, 'Tis knowne, fiue weekes fully pen'd it: From his owne hand, without a co-adiutor, Nouice, iourney-man, or tutor. Yet, thus much I can giue you, as a token Of his playes worth, no egges are broken; Nor quaking custards with fierce teeth affrighted, Wherewith your rout are so delighted; Nor hales he in a gull, old ends reciting, To stop gaps in his loose writing; With such a deale of monstrous, and forc'd action: As might make Bet'lem a faction: Nor made he' his play, for iests, stolne from each table. But makes iests, to fit his fable. And, so presents quick comÅdie, refined, As best Criticks haue designed, The lawes of time, place, persons he obserueth, From no needfull rule he swerueth. All gall, and coppresse, from his inke, he drayneth, Onely, a little salt remayneth; Wherewith, he'll rub your cheeks, til (red with laughter) They shall looke fresh, a weeke after.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. I. Scene I. Volpone , Mosca. Good morning to the day; and, next, my gold: Open the shrine, that I may see my saint. Haile the worlds soule, and mine. More glad then is The teeming earth, to see the long'd-for-sunne Peepe through the hornes of the celestiall ram, Am I, to view thy splendor, darkening his: That, lying here, amongst my other hoords, Shew'st like a flame, by night; or like the day Strooke out of chaos, when all darkenesse fled Vnto the center. O, thou sonne of Sol, (But brighter then thy father) let me kisse, With adoration, thee, and euery relique Of sacred treasure, in this blessed roome. Well did wise Poets, by thy glorious name, Title that age, which they would haue the best; Thou being the best of things: and far transcending All stile of ioy, in children, parents, friends, Or any other waking dreame on earth. Thy lookes, when they to Venvs did ascribe, They should haue giu'n her twentie thousand Cvpids; Such are thy beauties, and our loues! Deare saint, Riches, the dumbe god, that giu'st all men tongues: That canst doe nought, and yet mak'st men doe all things; The price of soules; euen hell, with thee to boot, Is made worth heauen! Thou art vertue, fame, Honour, and all things else! Who can get thee, He shall be noble, valiant, honest, wiseâ Mos. And what he will, sir. Riches are in fortune A greater good, then wisedome is in nature. Vol. True, my beloued Mosca. Yet, I glory More in the cunning purchase of my wealth, Then in the glad possession; since I gaine No common way: I vse no trade, no venter; I wound no earth with plow-shares; fat no beasts To feede the shambles; haue no mills for yron, Oyle, corne, or men, to grinde 'hem into poulder; I blow no subtill glasse; expose no ships To threatnings of the furrow-faced sea; I turne no moneys, in the publike banke; Nor vsure priuateâ Mos. No, sir, nor deuoure Soft prodigalls. You shall ha' some will swallow A melting heire, as glibly, as your Dutch Will pills of butter, and ne're purge for't; Teare forth the fathers of poore families Out of their beds, and coffin them, aliue, In some kind, clasping prison, where their bones May be forth-comming, when the flesh is rotten: But, your sweet nature doth abhorre these courses; You lothe, the widdowes, or the orphans teares Should wash your pauements; or their pittious cryes Ring in your roofes; and beate the aire, for vengeance.â Vol. Right, Mosca, I doe lothe it. Mos. And besides, sir, You are not like the thresher, that doth stand With a huge flaile, watching a heape of corne, And, hungrie, dares not taste the smallest graine, But feeds on mallowes, and such bitter herbs; Nor like the merchant, who hath fill'd his vaults With Romagnia, and rich Candian wines, Yet drinkes the lees of Lombards vineger: You will not lie in straw, whilst moths, and wormes Feed on your sumptuous hangings, and soft beds. You know the vse of riches, and dare giue, now, From that bright heape, to me, your poore obseruer, Or to your dwarfe, or your hermaphrodite, Your eunuch, or what other houshold-trifle Your pleasure allowes maint'nance.â Vol. Hold thee, Mosca, Take, of my hand; thou strik'st on truth, in all: And they are enuious, terme thee parasite. Call forth my dwarfe, my eunuch, and my foole, And let 'hem make me sport. What should I doe, But cocker vp my genius, and liue free To all delights, my fortune calls me to? I haue no wife, no parent, child, allie, To giue my substance to; but whom I make, Must be my heire: and this makes men obserue me. This drawes new clients, daily, to my house, Women, and men, of euery sexe, and age, That bring me presents, send me plate, coyne, iewels, With hope, that when I die, (which they expect Each greedy minute) it shall then returne, Ten-fold, vpon them; whil'st some, couetous Aboue the rest, seeke to engrosse me, whole, And counter worke, the one, vnto the other, Contend in gifts, as they would seeme, in loue: All which I suffer, playing with their hopes, And am content to coyne 'hem into profit, And looke vpon their kindnesse, and take more, And looke on that; still bearing them in hand, Letting the cherry knock against their lips, And, draw it, by their mouths, and back againe. How now! Scene II. Nano , Androgyno, Castrone, Volpone, Mosca. Now, roome, for fresh gamsters, who doe will you to know, They doe bring you neither play, nor Vniuersitie show; And therefore doe intreat you, that whatsoeuer they reherse, May not fare a whit the worse, for the false pase of the verse. If you wonder at this, you will wonder more, ere we passe, For know, here is inclos'd the Soule of Pythagoras, That iuggler diuine, as hereafter shall follow; Which Soule (fast, and loose, sir) came first from Apollo, And was breath'd into Ãthalides, Mercvrivs his sonne, Where it had the gift to remember all that euer was done. From thence it fled forth, and made quick transmigration To goldy-lockt Evphorbvs, who was kill'd, in good fashion, At the siege of old Troy, by the Cuckold of Sparta. Hermotimvs was next (I find it, in my charta) To whom it did passe, where no sooner it was missing, But with one Pyrrhvs, of Delos, it learn'd to goe a fishing: And thence, did it enter the Sophist of Greece. From Pythagore, shee went into a beautifull peece, Hight Aspasia, the meretrix; and the next tosse of her Was, againe, of a whore, shee became a Philosopher, Crates the Cynick: (as it selfe doth relate it) Since, Kings, Knights, and Beggers, Knaues, Lords and Fooles gat it, Besides, oxe, and asse, cammell, mule, goat, and brock, In all which it hath spoke, as in the Coblers cock. But I come not here, to discourse of that matter, Or his one, two, or three, or his great oath, by quater, His musicks, his trigon, his golden thigh, Or his telling how elements shift: but I Would aske, how of late, thou hast suffered translation, And shifted thy coat, in these dayes of reformation? And. Like one of the reformed, a Foole, as you see, Counting all old doctrine heresie. Nan. But not on thine owne forbid meates hast thou venter'd? And. On fish, when first, a carthusian I enter'd. Nan. Why, then thy dogmaticall silence hath left thee? And. Of that an obstreperous Lawyer bereft mee. Nan. O wonderfull change! when Sir Lawyer forsooke thee, For Pythagore's sake, what body then tooke thee? And. A good dull moyle. Nan. And how! by that meanes, Thou wert brought to allow of the eating of beanes? And. Yes. Nan. But, from the moyle, into whom did'st thou passe? And. Into a very strange beast, by some writers cal'd an asse; By others, a precise, pure, illuminate brother, Of those deuoure flesh, and sometimes one another: And will drop you forth a libell, or a sanctified lie, Betwixt euery spoonefull of a natiuitie-pie. Nan. Now quit thee, for heauen, of that profane nation; And gently, report thy next transmigration. And. To the same that I am. Nan. A creature of delight? And (what is more then a Foole) an hermaphrodite? Now pray thee, sweet Soule, in all thy variation, Which body would'st thou choose, to take vp thy station? And. Troth, this I am in, euen here would I tarry. Nan. 'Cause here, the delight of each sexe thou canst vary? And. Alas, those pleasures be stale, and forsaken; No, 'tis your Foole, wherewith I am so taken, The onely one creature, that I can call blessed: For all other formes I haue prou'd most distressed. Nan. Spoke true, as thou wert in Pythagoras still. This learned opinion we celebrate will, Fellow eunuch (as behooues vs) with all our wit, and art, To dignifie that, whereof our selues are so great, and speciall a part. Vol. Now very, very pretty: Mosca, this Was thy inuention? Mos. If it please my patron, Not else. Vol. It doth, good Mosca. Mos. Then it was, sir. Song. Fooles, they are the onely nation Worth mens enuy, or admiration; Free from care, or sorrow-taking, Selues, and others merry-making: All they speake, or doe, is sterling. Your Foole, he is your great mans dearling, And your ladies sport, and pleasure; Tongue, and bable are his treasure. Eene his face begetteth laughter, And he speakes truth, free from slaughter; Hee's the grace of euery feast, And, sometimes, the chiefest guests Hath his trencher, and his stoole, When wit waites vpon the foole. O, who would not bee Hee, hee, hee? One knocks without. Vol. Who's that? away, looke Mosca. Mos. Foole, be gone, 'Tis signior Voltore, the Aduocate, I know him, by his knock. Vol. Fetch me my gowne, My furres, and night-caps; say, my couch is changing: And let him entertayne himselfe, awhile, Without i'th' gallerie. Now, now, my clients Beginne their visitation! vulture, kite, Rauen, and gor-crow, all my birds of prey, That thinke me turning carcasse, now they come: I am not for 'hem yet. How now? the newes? Mos. A piece of plate, sir. Vol. Of what bignesse? Mos. Huge, Massie, and antique, with your name inscrib'd, And armes ingrauen. Vol. Good! and not a foxe Stretch'd on the earth, with fine delusiue sleights, Mocking a gaping crow? ha, Mosca? Mos. Sharpe, sir. Vol. Giue me my furres. Why dost thou laugh so, man? Mos. I cannot choose, sir, when I apprehend What thoughts he has (without) now, as he walkes: That this might be the last gift, he should giue; That this would fetch you; if you dyed to day, And gaue him all, what he should be to morrow; What large returne would come of all his venters; How he should worship'd be, and reuerenc'd; Ride, with his furres, and foot-clothes; waited on By herds of fooles, and clients; haue cleere way Made for his moyle, as letter'd as himselfe; Be cald the great, and learned Aduocate: And then concludes, there's nought impossible. Vol. Yes, to be learned, Mosca. Mos. O, no: rich Implies it. Hood an asse, with reuerend purple, So you can hide his two ambitious eares, And, he shall passe for a cathedrall Doctor. Vol. My caps, my caps, good Mosca, fetch him in. Mos. Stay, sir, your ointment for your eyes. Vol. That's true; Dispatch, dispatch: I long to haue possession Of my new present. Mos. That, and thousands more, I hope, to see you lord of. Vol. Thankes, kind Mosca. Mos. And that, when I am lost in blended dust, And hundred such, as I am, in successionâ Vol. Nay, that were too much, Mosca. Mos. You shall liue, Still, to delude these harpyies. Vol. Louing Mosca, 'Tis well, my pillow now, and let him enter. Now, my fain'd cough, my phthisick, and my gout, My apoplexie, palsie, and catarrhes, Helpe, with your forced functions, this my posture, Wherein, this three yeere, I haue milk'd their hopes. He comes, I heare him (vh, vh, vh, vh) Ã´. Scene III. Mosca , Voltore, Volpone. You still are, what you were, sir. Onely you (Of all the rest) are he, commands his loue: And you doe wisely, to preserue it, thus, With early visitation, and kind notes Of your good meaning to him, which, I know, Cannot but come most gratefull. Patron, sir. Here's signior Voltore is comeâ Volp. What say you? Mos. Sir, signior Voltore is come, this morning, To visit you. Volp. I thanke him. Mos. And hath brought A piece of antique plate, bought of S. Marke, With which he here presents you. Volp. He is welcome. Pray him, to come more often. Mos. Yes. Volt. What sayes he? Mos. He thanks you, and desires you see him often. Volp. Mosca. Mos. My patron? Volp. Bring him neere, where is he? I long to feele his hand. Mos. The plate is here, sir. Volt. How fare you, sir? Volp. I thanke you, signior Voltore. Where is the plate? mine eyes are bad. Volt. I'm sorry, To see you still thus weake. Mos. That he is not weaker. Volp. You are too munificent. Volt. No, sir, would to heauen, I could as well giue health to you, as that plate. Volp. You giue, sir, what you can. I thanke you. Your loue Hath taste in this, and shall not be vn-answer'd. I pray you see me often. Volt. Yes, I shall, sir. Volp. Be not far from me. Mos. Doe you obserue that, sir? Volp. Harken vnto me, still: It will concerne you. Mos. You are a happy man, sir, know your good. Volp. I cannot now last longâ Mos. (You are his heire, sir. Volt. Am I?) Volp. I feele me going, (vh, vh, vh, vh.) I am sayling to my port, (vh, vh, vh, vh?) And I am glad, I am so neere my hauen. Mos. Alas, kind gentleman, well, we must all goeâ Volt. But, Moscaâ Mos. Age wil conquer. Volt. Pray thee heare me. Am I inscrib'd his heire, for certayne? Mos. Are you? I doe beseech you, sir, you will vouchsafe To write me, i' your family. All my hopes, Depend vpon your worship. I am lost, Except the rising sunne doe shine on me. Volt. It shall both shine, and warme thee, Mosca. Mos. Sir. I am a man, that haue not done your loue All the worst offices: here I weare your keyes, See all your coffers, and your caskets lockt, Keepe the poore inuentorie of your iewels, Your plate, and moneyes, am your steward, sir, Husband your goods here. Volt. But am I sole heire? Mos. Without a partner, sir, confirm'd this morning; The waxe is warme yet, and the inke scarse drie Vpon the parchment. Volt. Happy, happy, me! By what good chance, sweet Mosca? Mos. Your desert, sir; I know no second cause. Volt. Thy modestie Is loth to know it; well, we shall requite it. Mos. He euer lik'd your course, sir, that first tooke him. I, oft, haue heard him say, how he admir'd Men of your large profession, that could speake To euery cause, and things mere contraries, Till they were hoarse againe, yet all be law; That, with most quick agilitie, could turne, And re-turne; make knots, and vndoe them; Giue forked counsell; take prouoking gold On either hand, and put it vp: these men, He knew, would thriue, with their humilitie. And (for his part) he thought, he should be blest To haue his heire of such a suffering spirit, So wise, so graue, of so perplex'd a tongue, And loud withall, that would not wag, nor scarce Lie still, without a fee; when euery word Your worship but lets fall, is a cecchine! Who's that? one knocks, I would not haue you seene, sir. Another knocks. And yetâpretend you came, and went in haste; I'le fashion an excuse. And, gentle sir, When you doe come to swim, in golden lard, Vp to the armes, in honny, that your chin Is borne vp stiffe, with fatnesse of the floud, Thinke on your vassall; but remember me: I ha' not beene your worst of clients. Volt. Moscaâ Mos. When will you haue your inuentorie brought, sir? Or see a coppy of the will? (anon) I'le bring 'hem to you, sir. Away, be gone, Put businesse i' your face. Volp. Excellent, Mosca! Come hither, let me kisse thee. Mos. Keepe you still, sir. Here is Corbaccio. Volp. Set the plate away, The vulture's gone, and the old rauen's come. Scene IIII. Mosca , Corbaccio, Volpone. Betake you, to your silence, and your sleepe: Stand there, and multiply. Now, shall wee see A wretch, who is (indeed) more impotent, Then this can faine to be; yet hopes to hop Ouer his graue. Signior Corbaccio! Yo' are very welcome, sir. Corb. How do's your patron? Mos. Troth, as he did, sir, no amends. Corb. What? mends he? Mos. No, sir: he is rather worse. Corb. That's well. Where is he? Mos. Vpon his couch, sir, newly fall'n asleepe. Corb. Do's he sleepe well? Mos. No winke, sir, all this night, Nor yesterday, but slumbers. Corb. Good! He should take Some counsell of physicians: I haue brought him An opiate here, from mine owne Doctorâ Mos. He will not heare of drugs. Corb. Why? I my selfe Stood by, while 't was made; saw all th'ingredients: And know, it cannot but most gently worke. My life for his, 'tis but to make him sleepe. Volp. I, his last sleepe, if he would take it. Mos. Sir, He ha's no faith in physick. Corb. 'Say you? 'say you? Mos. He ha's no faith in physick: he do's thinke, Most of your Doctors are the greater danger, And worse disease, t'escape. I often haue Heard him protest, that your physitian Should neuer be his heire. Corb. Not I his heire? Mos. Not your physitian, sir. Corb. O, no, no, no, I doe not meane it. Mos. No, sir, nor their fees He cannot brooke: he sayes, they flay a man, Before they kill him. Corb. Right, I doe conceiue you. Mos. And then, they doe it by experiment; For which the law not onely doth absolue 'hem, But giues them great reward: and, he is loth To hire his death, so. Corb. It is true, they kill, With as much licence, as a iudge. Mos. Nay, more; For he but kills, sir, where the law condemnes, And these can kill him, too. Corb. I, or me: Or any man. How do's his apoplexe? Is that strong on him, still? Mos. Most violent. His speech is broken, and his eyes are set, His face drawne longer, then 't was wontâ Corb. How? how? Stronger, then he was wont? Mos. No, sir: his face Drawne longer, then 't was wont. Corb. O, good. Mos. His mouth Is euer gaping, and his eye-lids hang. Corb. Good. Mos. A freezing numnesse stiffens all his ioynts, And makes the colour of his flesh like lead. Corb. 'Tis good. Mos. His pulse beats slow, and dull. Corb. Good symptomes, still. Mos. And, from his brainâ Corb. Ha? how? not from his brain? Mos. Yes, sir, and from his brainâ Corb. (I conceiue you, good.) Mos. Flowes a cold sweat, with a continuall rhewme, Forth the resolued corners of his eyes. Corb. Is't possible? yet I am better, ha! How do's he, with the swimming of his head? Mos. O, sir, 'tis past, the scotomy; he, now, Hath lost his feeling, and hath left to snort: You hardly can perceiue him, that he breathes. Corb. Excellent, excellent, sure I shall out-last him: This makes me yong againe, a score of yeeres. Mos. I was a comming for you, sir. Corb. Has he made his will? What has he giu'n me? Mos. No, sir. Corb. Nothing? ha? Mos. He has not made his will, sir. Corb. Oh, oh, oh. What then did Voltore, the Lawyer, here? Mos. He smelt a carcasse, sir, when he but heard My master was about his testament; (As I did vrge him to it, for your goodâ) Corb. He came vnto him, did he? I thought so. Mos. Yes, and presented him this piece of plate. Corb. To be his heire? Mos. I doe not know, sir. Corb. True, I know it too. Mos. By your owne scale, sir. Corb. Well, I shall preuent him, yet. See, Mosca, looke, Here, I haue brought a bag of bright cecchines, Will quite weigh downe his plate. Mos. Yea, mary, sir! This is true physick, this your sacred medicine, No talke of opiates, to this great elixir. Corb. 'Tis aurum palpabile, if not potabile. Mos. It shall be minister'd to him, in his bowle? Corb. I, doe, doe, doe. Mos. Most blessed cordiall! This will recouer him. Corb. Yes, doe, doe, doe. Mos. I thinke, it were not best, sir. Corb. What? Mos. To recouer him. Corb. O, no, no, no; by no meanes. Mos. Why, sir, this Will worke some strange effect, if he but feele it. Corb. 'Tis true, therefore forbeare, I'le take my venter: Giue me't againe. Mos. At no hand, pardon me; You shall not doe your selfe that wrong, sir. I Will so aduise you, you shall haue it all. Corb. How? Mos. All, sir, 'tis your right, your owne; no man Can claime a part: 'tis yours, without a riuall, Decree'd by destinie. Corb. How? how, good Mosca? Mos. I'le tell you, sir. This fit he shall recouerâ Corb. I doe conceiue you. Mos. And, on first aduantage Of his gayn'd sense, will I re-importune him Vnto the making of his testament: And shew him this. Corb. Good, good. Mos. 'Tis better yet, If you will heare, sir. Corb. Yes, with all my heart. Mos. Now, would I counsell you, make home with speed; There, frame a will: whereto you shall inscribe My master your sole heire. Corb. And disinherit My sonne? Mos. O, sir, the better: for that colour Shall make it much more taking. Corb. O, but colour? Mos. This will, sir, you shall send it vnto me. Now, when I come to inforce (as I will doe) Your cares, your watchings, and your many prayers, Your more then many gifts, your this dayes present, And, last, produce your will; where (without thought, Or least regard, vnto your proper issue, A sonne so braue, and highly meriting) The streame of your diuerted loue hath throwne you Vpon my master, and made him your heire: He cannot be so stupide, or stone dead, But, out of conscience, and mere gratitudeâ Corb. He must pronounce me, his? Mos. 'Tis true. Corb. This plot Did I thinke on before. Mos. I doe beleeue it. Corb. Doe you not beleeue it? Mos. Yes, sir. Corb. Mine owne proiect. Mos. Which when he hath done, sirâ Corb. Publish'd me his heire? Mos. And you so certayne, to suruiue himâ Corb. I. Mos. Being so lusty a manâ Corb. 'Tis true. Mos. Yes, sirâ Corb. I thought on that too. See, how he should be The very organ, to expresse my thoughts! Mos. You haue not onely done your selfe a goodâ Corb. But multiplyed it on my sonne? Mos. 'Tis right, sir. Corb. Still, my inuention. Mos. 'Lasse sir, heauen knowes, It hath beene all my studie, all my care, (I'eene grow grey withall) how to worke thingsâ Corb. I doe conceiue, sweet Mosca. Mos. You are he, For whom I labour, here. Corb. I, doe, doe, doe: I'le straight about it. Mos. Rooke goe with you, rauen. Corb. I know thee honest. Mos. You doe lie, sirâ Corb. Andâ Mos. Your knowledge is no better then your eares, sir. Corb. I doe not doubt, to be a father to thee. Mos. Nor I, to gull my brother of his blessing. Corb. I may ha' my youth restor'd to me, why not? Mos. Your worship is a precious asseâ Corb. What say'st thou? Mos. I doe desire your worship, to make haste, sir. Corb. 'Tis done, 'tis done, I goe. Volp. O, I shall burst; Let out my sides, let out my sidesâ Mos. Contayne Your fluxe of laughter, sir: you know, this hope Is such a bait, it couers any hooke. Volp. O, but thy working, and thy placing it! I cannot hold; good rascall, let me kisse thee: I neuer knew thee, in so rare a humour. Mos. Alas, sir, I but doe, as I am taught; Follow your graue instructions; giue 'hem wordes; Powre oyle into their eares: and send them hence. Volp. 'Tis true, 'tis true. What a rare punishment Is auarice, to it selfe? Mos. I, with our helpe, sir. Volp. So many cares, so many maladies, So many feares attending on old age, Yea, death so often call'd on, as no wish Can be more frequent with 'hem, their limbs faint, Their senses dull, their seeing, hearing, going, All dead before them; yea, their very teeth, Their instruments of eating, fayling them: Yet this is reckon'd life! Nay, here was one, Is now gone home, that wishes to liue longer! Feeles not his gout, nor palsie, faines himselfe Yonger, by scores of yeeres, flatters his age, With confident belying it, hopes he may With charmes, like Ãson, haue his youth restor'd: And with these thoughts so battens, as if fate Would be as easily cheated on, as he, And all turnes aire! Who's that, there, now? a third? Another knocks. Mos. Close, to your couch againe: I heare his voyce. It is Corvino, our spruce Merchant. Volp. Dead. Mos. Another bout, sir, with your eyes. Who's there? Scene V. Mosca , Corvino, Volpone. Signior Corvino! come most wisht for! O, How happy were you, if you knew it, now! Corv. Why? what? wherein? Mos. The tardie houre is come, sir. Corv. He is not dead? Mos. Not dead, sir, but as good; He knowes no man. Corv. How shall I doe, then? Mos. Why, sir? Corv. I haue brought him, here, a pearle. Mos. Perhaps, he has So much remembrance left, as to know you, sir; He still calls on you, nothing but your name Is in his mouth: Is your pearle orient, sir? Corv. Venice was neuer owner of the like. Volp. Signior Corvino. Mos. Harke. Volp. Signior Corvino. Mos. 'He calls you, step and giue it him. H'is here, sir, And he has brought you a rich pearle. Corv. How doe you, sir? Tell him, it doubles the twelfe caract. Mos. Sir, He cannot vnderstand, his hearing's gone; And yet it comforts him, to see youâ Corv. Say, I haue a diamant for him, too. Mos. Best shew't, sir, Put it into his hand; 'tis onely there He apprehends: he has his feeling, yet. See, how he grasps it! Corv. 'Lasse, good gentleman! How pittifull the sight is! Mos. Tut, forget, sir. The weeping of an heire should still be laughter, Vnder a visor. Corv. Why? am I his heire? Mos. Sir, I am sworne, I may not shew the will, Till he be dead: But, here has beene Corbaccio, Here has beene Voltore, here were others too, I cannot number 'hem, they were so many, All gaping here for legacies; but I, Taking the vantage of his naming you, (Signior Corvino, Signior Corvino) tooke Paper, and pen, and inke, and there I ask'd him, Whom he would haue his heire? Corvino. Who Should be executor? Corvino. And, To any question, he was silent too, I still interpreted the nods, he made (Through weakenesse) for consent: and sent home th'others, Nothing bequeath'd them, but to crie, and curse. They embrace. Corv. O, my deare Mosca. Do's he not perceiue vs? Mos. No more then a blind harper. He knowes no man, No face of friend, nor name of any seruant, Who't was that fed him last, or gaue him drinke: Not those, he hath begotten, or brought vp Can he remember. Corv. Has he children? Mos. Bastards, Some dozen, or more, that he begot on beggers, Gipseys, and Iewes, and black-moores, when he was drunke. Knew you not that, sir? 'Tis the common fable. The Dwarfe, the Foole, the Eunuch are all his; H'is the true father of his family, In all, saue me: but he has giu'n 'hem nothing. Corv. That's well, that's well. Art sure he does not heare vs? Mos. Sure, sir? why, looke you, credit your owne sense. The poxe approch, and adde to your diseases, If it would send you hence the sooner, sir. For, your incontinence, it hath deseru'd it Throughly, and throughly, and the plague to boot. (You may come neere, sir) would you would once close Those filthy eyes of yours, that flow with slime, Like two frog-pits; and those same hanging cheeks, Couer'd with hide, in stead of skin: (nay, helpe, sir) That looke like frozen dish-clouts, set on end. Corv. Or, like an old smok'd wall, on which the raine Ran downe in streakes. Mos. Excellent, sir, speake out; You may be lowder yet: a culuering, Discharged in his eare, would hardly bore it. Corv. His nose is like a common sewre, still running. Mos. 'Tis good! and, what his mouth? Corv. A very draught. Mos. O, stop it vpâ Corv. By no meanes. Mos. 'Pray you let me. Faith, I could stifle him, rarely, with a pillow, As well, as any woman, that should keepe him. Corv. Doe as you will, but I'le be gone. Mos. Be so; It is your presence makes him last so long. Corv. I pray you, vse no violence. Mos. No, sir? why? Why should you be thus scrupulous? pray you, sir. Corv. Nay, at your discretion. Mos. Well, good sir, be gone. Corv. I will not trouble him now, to take my pearle? Mos. Puh, nor your diamant. What a needlesse care Is this afflicts you? Is not all, here, yours? Am not I here? whom you haue made? your creature? That owe my being to you? Corv. Gratefull Mosca! Thou art my friend, my fellow, my companion, My partner, and shalt share in all my fortunes. Mos. Excepting one. Corv. What's that? Mos. Your gallant wife, sir. Now, is he gone: we had no other meanes, To shoot him hence, but this. Volp. My diuine Mosca! Thou hast to day out-gone thy selfe. Who's there? Another knocks. I will be troubled with no more. Prepare Me musicke, dances, banquets, all delights; The Turke is not more sensuall, in his pleasures, Then will Volpone. Let mee see, a pearle? A diamant? plate? cecchines? good mornings purchase; Why, this is better then rob churches, yet: Or fat, by eating (once a mon'th) a man. Who is't? Mos. The beauteous lady Wolvd-bee, sir. Wife to the English Knight, Sir Politiqve Wovld-bee, (This is the stile, sir, is directed mee) Hath sent to know, how you haue slept to night, And if you would be visited. Volp. Not, now. Some three houres, henceâ Mos. I told the Squire, so much. Volp. When I am high with mirth, and wine: then, then. 'Fore heauen, I wonder at the desperate valure Of the bold English, that they dare let loose Their wiues, to all encounters! Mos. Sir, this knight Had not his name for nothing, he is politique, And knowes, how ere his wife affect strange aires, Shee hath not yet the face, to be dishonest. But, had shee signior Corvino's wiues faceâ Volp. Has shee so rare a face? Mos. O, sir, the wonder, The blazing starre of Italie! a wench O' the first yeere! a beautie, ripe, as haruest! Whose skin is whiter then a swan, all ouer! Then siluer, snow, or lillies! a soft lip, Would tempt you to eternitie of kissing! And flesh, that melteth, in the touch, to bloud! Bright as your gold! and louely, as your gold! Volp. Why had not I knowne this, before? Mos. Alas, sir. My selfe, but yesterday, discouer'd it. Volp. How might I see her? Mos. O, not possible; Shee's kept as warily, as is your gold: Neuer do's come abroad, neuer takes ayre, But at a windore. All her lookes are sweet, As the first grapes, or cherries: and are watch'd As neere, as they are. Volp. I must see herâ Mos. Sir. There is a guard, of ten spies thick, vpon her; All his whole houshold: each of which is set Vpon his fellow, and haue all their charge, When he goes out, when he comes in, examin'd. Volp. I will goe see her, though but at her windore. Mos. In some disguise, then. Volp. That is true. I must Maintayne mine owne shape, still, the same: wee'll thinke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Scene I. Politiqve Wovld-bee, Peregrine. Sir, to a wise man, all the world's his soile. It is not Italie, nor France, nor Europe, That must bound me, if my fates call me forth. Yet, I protest, it is no salt desire Of seeing countries, shifting a religion, Nor any dis-affection to the state Where I was bred (and, vnto which I owe My dearest plots) hath brought me out; much lesse, That idle, antique, stale, grey-headed proiect Of knowing mens minds, and manners, with Vlysses: But, a peculiar humour of my wiues, Laid for this height of Venice, to obserue, To quote, to learne the language, and so forthâ I hope you trauell, sir, with licence? Per. Yes. Pol. I dare the safelier conuerseâHow long, sir, Since you left England? Per. Seuen weekes. Pol. So lately! You ha' not beene with my lord Ambassador? Per. Not yet, sir. Pol. Pray you, what newes, sir, vents our climate? I heard, last night, a most strange thing reported By some of my lords followers, and I long To heare, how't will be seconded! Per. What was't, sir? Pol. Mary, sir, of a rauen, that should build In a ship royall of the Kings. Per. This fellow Do's he gull me, trow? or is gull'd? your name, sir? Pol. My name is Politiqve Wovld-bee. Per. O, that speaks him. A Knight, sir? Pol. A poore knight, sir. Per. Your lady Lies here, in Venice, for intelligence Of tyres and fashions, and behauiour, Among the curtizans? the fine lady Wovld-bee? Pol. Yes, sir, the spider, and the bee, oft-times, Suck from one flowre. Per. Good sir Politiqve! I cry you mercie; I haue heard much of you: 'Tis true, sir of your rauen. Pol. On your knowledge? Per. Yes, and your lyons whelping, in the Tower. Pol. Another whelpe! Per. Another,sir. Pol. Now, heauen! What prodigies be these? The fires at Berwike! And the new starre! these things concurring, strange! And full of omen! Saw you those meteors? Per. I did, sir. Pol. Fearefull! Pray you sir, confirme me, Were there three porcpisces seene, aboue the bridge, As they giue out? Per. Sixe, and and a sturgeon, sir. Pol. I am astonish'd! Per. Nay, sir, be not so; Ile tell you a greater prodigie, then theseâ Pol. What should these things portend! Per. The verie day (Let me be sure) that I put forth from London, There was a whale discouer'd, in the riuer, As high as Woolwich, that had waited there (Few know how manie mon'ths) for the subuersion Of the Stode-Fleet. Pol. It's possible? Beleeue it, 'Twas either sent from Spaine, or the Arch-dukes! Spinola's whale, vpon my life, my credit! Will they not leaue these proiects? Worthie sir, Some other newes. Per. Faith, Stone, the foole, is dead; And they doe lacke a tauerne-foole, extremely. Pol. Is Mass' Stone dead? Per. H'is dead, sir, why? I hope You thought him not immortall? O, this Knight (Were he well knowne) would be a precious thing To fit our English stage: He that should write But such a fellow, should be thought to faine Extremely, if not maliciously. Pol. Stone dead! Per. Dead. Lord! how deeply, sir, you apprehend it? He was no kinsman to you? Pol. That I know of. Well! that same fellow was an vnknowne foole. Per. And yet you knew him, it seemes? Pol. I did so. Sir, I knew him one of the most dangerous heads Liuing within the state, and so I held him. Per. Indeed, sir? Pol. While he liu'd, in action. He has receiu'd weekely intelligence, Vpon my knowledge, out of the low Countries, (For all parts of the world) in cabages; And those dispens'd, againe, to' Ambassadors, In oranges, musk-melons, apricotes, Limons, pome-citrons, and such like: sometimes, In Colchester-oysters, and your Selsey-cockles. Pet. You make me wonder! Pol. Sir, vpon my knowledge. Nay, I haue obseru'd him, at your publique ordinarie, Take his aduertisement, from a traueller (A conceal'd states-man) in a trencher of meat: And, instantly, before the meale was done, Conuey an answere in a tooth-pick. Per. Strange! How could this be, sir? Pol. Why, the meat was cut So like his character, and so laid, as he Must easily reade the cypher. Per. I haue heard, He could not reade, sir. Pol. So, 'twas giuen out, (In politie) by those, that did imploy him: But he could read, and had your languages, And to't, as sound a noddleâ Per. I haue heard, sir, That your Bab'ouns were spies; and that they were A kind of subtle nation, neere to China. Pol. I, I, your Mamuluchi. Faith, they had Their hand in a French plot, or two; but they Were so extremely giuen to women, as They made discouery of all: yet I Had my aduises here (on wensday last) From one of their owne coat, they were return'd, Made their relations (as the fashion is) And now stand faire, for fresh imployment. Per. 'Hart! This, sir Poll. will be ignorant of nothing. It seemes, sir, you know all? Pol. Not all, sir. But, I haue some generall notions; I doe loue To note, and to obserue: though I liue out, Free from the actiue torrent, yet I'ld marke The currents, and the passages of things, For mine owne priuate vse; and know the ebbes, And flowes of state. Per. Beleeue it, sir, I hold My selfe, in no small tie, vnto my fortunes, For casting me thus luckily, vpon you; Whose knowledge (if your bountie equall it) May doe me great assistance, in instruction For my behauiour, and my bearing, which Is yet so rude, and rawâ Pol. Why? came you forth Emptie of rules, for trauaile? Per. Faith, I had Some common ones, from out that vulgar grammar, Which he, that cry'd Italian to me, taught me. Pol. Why, this it is, that spoiles all our braue blouds; Trusting our hopefull gentrie vnto pedants: Fellowes of out-side, and mere barke. You seeme To be a gentleman, of ingenuous raceâ I not professe it, but my fate hath beene To be, where I haue beene consulted with, In this high kind, touching some great mens sonnes, Persons of bloud, and honourâ Per. Who be these, sir? Scene II. Mosca , Politiqve, Peregrine, Volpone, Nano, Grege. Vnder that windore, there't must be. The same. Pol. Fellowes, to mount a banke! Did your instructer In the deare tongues, neuer discourse to you Of the Italian mountebankes? Per. Yes, sir. Pol. Why, Here shall you see one. Per. They are quack-saluers, Fellowes, that liue by venting oyles, and drugs? Pol. Was that the character he gaue you of them? Per. As I remember. Pol. Pitie his ignorance. They are the onely-knowing men of Europe! Great generall schollers, excellent phisicians, Most admir'd states-men, profest fauourites, And cabinet-counsellors, to the greatest princes! The onely languag'd-men, of all the world! Per. And, I haue heard, they are most lewd impostors; Made all of termes, and shreds; no lesse belyers Of great-mens fauours, then their owne vile med'cines; Which they will vtter, vpon monstrous othes: Selling that drug, for two pence, ere they part, Which they haue valu'd at twelue crownes, before. Pol. Sir, calumnies are answer'd best with silence: Your selfe shall iudge. Who is it mounts, my friends? Mos. Scoto of Mantua, sir. Pol. Is't he? nay, then I'le proudly promise, sir, you shall behold Another man, then has beene phant'sied to you. I wonder, yet, that he should mount his banke Here, in this nooke, that has beene wont t'appeare In face of the piazza! Here, he comes. Volp. Mount, Zany. Gre. Follow, follow, follow, follow, follow. Pol. See how the people follow him! h'is a man May write 10000 crownes, in banke, here. Note, Marke but his gesture: I doe vse to obserue The state he keeps, in getting vp! Per. 'Tis worth it, sir. Volp. Most noble gent: and my worthy patrons, it may seeme strange, that I, your Scoto Mantvano, who was euer wont to fixe my banke in face of the publike piazza, neere the shelter of the portico, to the procuratia, should, now (after eight months absence, from this illustrous city of Venice) humbly retire my selfe, into an obscure nooke of the piazza. Pol. Did not I, now, obiect the same? Per. Peace, sir. Volp. Let me tell you: I am not (as your Lombard prouerb saith) cold on my feet; or content to part with my commodities at a cheaper rate, then I accustomed: looke not for it. Nor, that the calumnious reports of that impudent detractor, and shame to our profession, (Alessandro Bvttone, I meane) who gaue out, in publike, I was condemn'd a' Sforzato to the galleys, for poysoning the Cardinall Bembo'sâCooke, hath at all attached, much lesse deiected me. No, no, worthy gent. (to tell you true) I cannot indure, to see the rabble of these ground Ciarlitani, that spread their clokes on the pauement, as if they meant to do feates of actiuitie, and then come in, lamely, with their mouldy tales out of Boccacio, like stale Tabarine, the Fabulist: some of them discoursing their trauells, and of their tedious captiuity in the Turkes galleyes, when indeed (were the truth knowne) they were the Christians galleyes, where very temperately, they eate bread, and drunke water, as a wholesome penance (enioyn'd them by their Confessors) for base pilferies. Pol. Note but his bearing, and contempt of these. Volp. These turdy-facy-nasty-paty-lousy-farticall rogues, with one poore groats-worth of vn-prepar'd antimony, finely wrapt vp in seuerall scartoccios, are able, very well, to kill their twentie a weeke, and play; yet, these meagre staru'd spirits, who haue halfe stopt the organs of their mindes with earthy oppilations, want not their fauourers among your shriuel'd, sallad-eating artizans: who are ouer-ioy'd, that they may haue their halfe-pe'rth of physick, though it purge 'hem into another world, 't makes no matter. Pol. Excellent! ha' you heard better language, sir? Volp. Well, let 'hem goe. And gentlemen, honorable gentlemen, know, that for this time, our banke, being thus remou'd from the clamours of the canaglia, shall be the scene of pleasure, and delight: For, I haue nothing to sell, little, or nothing to sell. Pol. I told you, sir, his end. Per. You did so, sir. Volp. I protest, I, and my sixe seruants, are not able to make of this precious liquor, so fast, as it is fetch'd away from my lodging, by gentlemen of your city; strangers of the terra-ferma; worshipfull merchants; I, and senators too: who, euer since my arriuall, haue detayned me to their vses, by their splendidous liberalities. And worthily. For, what auailes your rich man to haue his magazines stuft with moscadelli, or of the purest grape, when his physitians prescribe him (on paine of death) to drinke nothing but water, cocted with anise-seeds? O, health! health! the blessing of the rich! the riches of the poore! who can buy thee at too deare a rate, since there is no enioying this world, without thee? Be not then so sparing of your purses, honorable gentlemen, as to abridge the naturall course of lifeâ Per. You see his end? Pol. I, is't not good? Volp. For, when a humide fluxe, or catarrhe, by the mutability of aire, falls from your head, into an arme, or shoulder, or any other part; take you a duckat, or your cecchine of gold, and apply to the place affected: see, what good effect it can worke. No, no, 'tis this blessed vnguento, this rare extraction, that hath only power to disperse all malignant humours, that proceed, either of hot, cold, moist, or windy causesâ Per. I would he had put in drie to. Pol. 'Pray you, obserue. Volp. To fortifie the most indigest, and crude stomack, I, were it of one, that (through extreme weakenesse) vomited bloud, applying only a warme napkin to the place, after the vnction, and fricace; for the vertigine, in the head, putting but a drop into your nostrills, likewise, behind the eares; a most soueraigne, and approued remedie: the mal-caduco, crampes, conuulsions, paralysies, epilepsies, tremor-cordia, retyred-nerues, ill vapours of the spleene, stoppings of the liuer, the stone, the strangury, hernia ventosa, iliaca passio; stops a disenteria, immediately; easeth the torsion of the small guts; and cures melancolia hypocondriaca, being taken and applyed, according to my printed receipt. For, this is the physitian, this the medicine; this counsells, this cures; this Pointing to his bill and his glasse. giues the direction, this workes the effect: and (in summe) both together may bee term'd an abstract of the theorick, and practick in the Ãsculapian arte. 'Twill cost you eight crownes. And, Zan Fritada, 'pray thee sing a verse, extempore, in honour of it. Pol. How doe you like him, sir? Per. Most strangely, I! Pol. Is not his language rare? Per. But Alchimy I neuer heard the like: or Brovghtons bookes. Song. Had old Hippocrates, or Galen, (That to their bookes put med'cines all in) But knowne this secret, they had neuer (Of which they will be guiltie euer) Beene murderers of so much paper, Or wasted many a hurtlesse taper: No Indian drug had ere beene famed, Tabacco, sassafras not named; Ne yet, of guacum one small stick, sir, Nor Raymvnd Lvllies great elixir. Ne, had beene knowne the Danish Gonswart. Or Paracelsvs, with his long-sword. Per. All this, yet, will not doe, eight crownes is high. Volp. No more, Gentlemen, if I had but time to discourse to you the miraculous effects of this my oile, surnamed oglio del Scoto; with the count-lesse catalogue of those I haue cured of th'aforesaid, and many more diseases; the pattents and priuiledges of all the Princes, and common-wealths of Chistendome; or but the depositions of those that appear'd on my part, before the signiory of the SanitÃ¢, and most learned colledge of physitians; where I was authorized, vpon notice taken of the admirable vertues of my medicaments, and mine owne excellency, in matter of rare, and vnknowne secrets, not onely to disperse them publiquely in this famous citie, but in all the territories, that happily ioy vnder the gouernement of the most pious and magnificent states of Italy. But may some other gallant fellow say, O, there be diuers, that make profession to haue as good, and as experimented receipts, as yours: Indeed, very many haue assay'd, like apes in imitation of that, which is really and essentially in mee, to make of this oyle; bestow'd great cost in furnaces, stilles, alembeks, continuall fires, and preparation of the ingredients, (as indeede there goes to it sixe hundred seuerall simples, besides, some quantity of humane fat, for the conglutination, which we buy of the anatomistes) but, when these practitioners come to the last decoction, blow, blow, puff, puff, and all flies in fumo: ha, ha, ha. Poore wretches! I rather pittie their folly, and indiscretion, then their losse of time, and money; for those may be recouered by industrie: but to bee a foole borne, is a disease incurable. For my selfe, I alwaies from my youth haue indeuour'd to get the rarest secrets, and booke them; either in exchange, or for money: I spared nor cost, nor labour, where any thing was worthy to bee learned. And gentlemen, honourable gentlemen, I will vndertake (by vertue of chymicall art) out of the honourable hat, that couers your head, to extract the foure elements; that is to say, the fire, ayre, water, and earth, and returne you your felt without burne, or staine. For, whil'st others haue beene at the balloo, I haue beene at my booke: and am now past the craggie pathes of studie, and come to the flowrie plaines of honour, and reputation. Pol. I doe assure you, sir, that is his ayme. Volp. But, to our price. Per. And that withall, sir Pol. Volp. You all know (honourable gentlemen) I neuer valu'd this ampulla, or viall, at lesse then eight crownes, but for this time, I am content, to be depriu'd of it for sixe; sixe crownes is the price; and lesse in courtesie, I know you cannot offer me: take it, or leaue it, howsoeuer, both it, and I, am at your seruice. I aske you not, as the value of the thing, for then I should demand of you a thousand crownes, so the Cardinals Montalto, Fernese, the great duke of Tuscany, my gossip, with diuers other princes haue giuen me, but I despise money; onely to shew my affection to you, honourable gentlemen, and your illustrous state here, I haue neglected the messages of these princes, mine owne offices, fram'd my iourney hither, onely to present you with the fruits of my trauels. Tune your voices once more to the touch of your instruments, and give the honourable assembly some delightfull recreation. Per. What monstrous, and most painefull circumstance Is here, to get some three, or foure gazets! Some three-pence, i'th whole, for that 'twill come to. Song. You that would last long, lift to my song, Make no more coyle, but buy of this oyle. Would you be euer faire? and yong? Stout of teeth? and strong of tongue? Tart of palat? quick of eare? Sharpe of sight? of nostrill cleare? Moist of hand? and light of foot? (Or I will come neerer to't) Would you liue free from all diseases? Doe the act, your mistris pleases; Yet fright all aches from your bones? Here's a med'cine, for the nones. Volp. Well, I am in a humour (at this time) to make a present of the small quantitie my coffer containes: to the rich, in courtesie, and to the poore, for Gods sake. Wherefore, now marke; I ask'd you sixe crownes; and sixe crownes, at other times, you haue paid me; you shall not giue me sixe crownes, nor fiue, nor foure, nor three, nor two, nor one; nor halfe a duckat; no, nor a muccinigo: sixeâpence it will cost you, or sixe hundred poundâexpect no lower price, for by the banner of my front, I will not bate a bagatine, that I will haue, only, a pledge of your loues, to carry something from amongst you, to shew, I am not contemn'd by you. Therefore, now, tosse your handkerchiefes, chearefully, chearefully; and be aduertised, that the first heroique spirit, that deignes to grace me, with a handkerchiefe, I will giue it a little remembrance of something, beside, shall please it better, then if I had presented it with a double pistolet. Per. Will you be that heroique sparke, sir Pol? O, see! the windore has preuented you. CELIA at the windo' throwes downe her handkerchiefe. Volp. Lady, I kisse your bountie: and, for this timely grace, you haue done your poore Scoto of Mantua, I will returne you, ouer and aboue my oile, a secret, of that high, and inestimable nature, shall make you for euer enamour'd on that minute, wherein your eye first descended on so meane, (yet not altogether to be despis'd) an obiect. Here is a poulder, conceal'd in this paper, of which, if I should speake to the worth, nine thousand volumes were but as one page, that page as a line, that liue as a word: so short is this pilgrimage of man (which some call life) to the expressing of it. Would I reflect on the price? why, the whole world were but as an empire, that empire as a prouince, that prouince as a banke, that banke as a priuate purse, to the purchase of it. I will, onely, tell you; It is the poulder, that made Venvs a goddesse (giuen her by Apollo) that kept her perpetually yong, clear'd her wrincles, firm'd her gummes, fill'd her skin, colour'd her haire; from her, deriu'd to Helen, and at the sack of Troy (vnfortunately) lost: till now, in this our age, it was as happily recouer'd, by a studious Antiquarie, out of some ruines of Asia, who sent a moyetie of it, to the court of France (but much sophisticated) wherewith the ladies there, now, colour their haire. The rest (at this present) remaines with me; extracted, to a quintessence: so that, where euer it but touches, in youth it perpetually preserues, in age restores the complexion; seat's your teeth, did they dance like virginall iacks, firme as a wall; makes them white, as iuory, that were black, asâ Scene III. Corvino , Politiqve, Peregrine. He beates away the montebanke &amp;c. Spight o' the deuill, and my shame! come downe, here; Come downe: no house but mine to make your scene? Signior Flaminio, will you downe, sir? downe? What is my wife your Franciscina? sir? No windores on the whole piazza, here, To make your properties, but mine? but mine? Hart! ere to morrow, I shall be new christen'd, And cald the Pantalone di besogniosi, About the towne. Per. What should this meane, sir Pol? Pol. Some trick of state, beleeue it. I will home. Per. It may be some designe, on you. Pol. I know not. I'le stand vpon my guard. Per. It is your best, sir. Pol. This three weekes, all my aduises, all my letters, They haue beene intercepted. Per. Indeed, sir? Best haue a care. Pol. Nay, so I will. Per. This knight, I may not lose him, for my mirth, till night. Scene IIII. Volpone , Mosca. O, I am wounded. Mos. Where, sir? Volp. Not without; Those blowes were nothing: I could beare them euer. But angry Cvpid, bolting from her eyes, Hath shot himselfe into me, like a flame; Where, now, he flings about his burning heat, As in a fornace, an ambitious fire, Whose vent is stopt. The fight is all within me. I cannot liue, except thou helpe me, Mosca; My liuer melts, and I, without the hope Of some soft aire, from her refreshing breath, Am but a heape of cinders. Mos. 'Lasse, good sir! Would you had neuer seene her. Volp. Nay, would thou Had'st neuer told me of her. Mos. Sir, 'tis true; I doe confesse, I was vnfortunate, And you vnhappy: but I'am bound in conscience, No lesse then duty, to effect my best To your release of torment, and I will, sir. Volp. Deare Mosca, shall I hope? Mos. Sir, more then deare, I will not bid you to despaire of ought, Within a humane compasse. Volp. O, there spoke My better Angell. Mosca, take my keyes, Gold, plate, and iewells, all's at thy deuotion; Employ them, how thou wilt; nay, coyne me, too: So thou, in this, but crowne my longings. Mosca? Mos. Vse but your patience. Volp. So I haue. Mos. I doubt not To bring successe to your desires. Volp. Nay, then, I not repent me of my late disguise. Mos. If you can horne him, sir, you need not. Volp. True: Besides, I neuer meant him for my heire. Is not the colour o' my beard, and eye-browes, To make me knowne? Mos. No iot. Volp. I did it well. Mos. So well, would I could follow you in mine, With halfe the happinesse; and, yet, I would Escape your epilogue. Volp. But, were they gull'd With a beliefe, that I was Scoto? Mos. Sir, Scoto himselfe could hardly haue distinguish'd! I haue not time to flatter you, now, wee'll part: And, as I prosper, so applaud my art. Scene V. Corvino , Celia, Servitore. Death of mine honour, with the cities foole? A iuggling, tooth-drawing, prating mountebanke? And, at a publike windore? where whil'st he, With his strain'd action, and his dole of faces, To his drug-lecture drawes your itching eares, A crue of old, vn-marri'd, noted lechers, Stood leering vp, like Satyres: and you smile, Most graciously! and fan your fauours forth, To giue your hot spectators satisfaction! What, was your mountebanke their call? their whistle? Or were you' enamour'd on his copper rings? His saffron iewell, with the toade-stone in't? Or his imbroidred sute, with the cope-stitch, Made of a herse-cloth? or his old tilt-feather? Or his starch'd beard? well! you shall haue him, yes. He shall come home, and minister vnto you The fricace, for the moother. Or, let me see, I thinke, you had rather mount? would you not mount? Why, if you'll mount, you may; yes truely, you may: And so, you may be seene, downe to'th' foot. Get you a citterne, lady vanitie, And be a dealer, with the vertuous man; Make one: I'le but protest my selfe a cuckold, And saue your dowrie. I am a Dutchman, I! For, if you thought me an Italian, You would be damn'd, ere you did this, you whore: Thou'ldst tremble, to imagine, that the murder Of father, mother, brother, all thy race, Should follow, as the subiect of my iustice! Cel. Good sir, haue patience! Corv. What coul'dst thou propose Lesse to thy selfe, then, in this heat of wrath, And stung with my dishonour, I should strike This steele vnto thee, with as many stabs, As thou wert gaz'd vpon with goatish eyes? Cel. Alasse sir, be appeas'd! I could not thinke My being at the windore should more, now, Moue your impatience, then at other times. Corv. No? not to seeke, and entertaine a parlee, With a knowne knaue? before a multitude? You were an actor, with your handkerchiefe! Which he, most sweetly, kist in the receipt, And might (no doubt) returne it, with a letter, And point the place, where you might meet: your sisters, Your mothers, or your aunts might serue the turne. Cel. Why, deare sir, when doe I make these excuses? Or euer stirre, abroad, but to the church? And that, so seldomeâ Corv. Well, it shall be lesse; And thy restraint, before, was libertie, To what I now decree: and therefore, marke me. First, I will haue this bawdy light dam'd vp; And, til 't be done, some two, or three yards off, I'le chalke a line: o're which, if thou but chance To set thy desp'rate foot; more hell, more horror, More wilde, remorcelesse rage shall seize on thee, Then on a coniurer, that, had heedlesse left His circles safetie, ere his deuill was laid. Then, here's a locke, which I will hang vpon thee; And, now I thinke on't, I will keepe thee backe-wards; Thy lodging shall be backe-wards; thy walkes back-wards; Thy prospect-all be backe-wards; and no pleasure, That thou shalt know but backe-wards: Nay, since you force My honest nature, know, it is your owne Being too open, makes me vse you thus. Since you will not containe your subtle nostrils In a sweet roome, but they must snuffe the ayre Of ranke, and sweatie passengersâOne knockes. Knocke within Away, and be not seene, paine of thy life; Not looke toward the windore: if thou dostâ (Nay stay, heare this) let me not prosper, whore, But I will make thee an anatomie, Dissect thee mine owne selfe, and read a lecture Vpon thee, to the citie, and in publique. Away. Who's there? Ser. 'Tis signior Mosca, sir. Scene. VI. Corvino , Mosca. Let him come in, his master's dead: There's yet Some good, to helpe the bad. My Mosca, welcome, I ghesse your newes. Mos. I feare you cannot, sir. Corv. Is't not his death? Mos. Rather the contrarie. Corv. Not his recouerie? Mos. Yes, sir, Corv. I am curst, I am bewitch'd, my crosses meet to vex me. How? how? how? how? Mos. Why, sir, with Scoto's oyle! Corbaccio, and Voltore brought of it, Whil'st I was busie in an inner roomeâ Corv. Death! that damn'd mountebanke! but, for the law, Now, I could kill the raskall: 't cannot be, His oyle should haue that vertue. Ha' not I Knowne him a common rogue, come fidling in To th'osteria, with a tumbling whore, And, when he ha's done all his forc'd trickes, beene glad Of a poore spoonefull of dead wine, with flyes in't? It cannot be. All his ingredients Are a sheepes gall, a rosted bitches marrow, Some few sod earewigs, pounded caterpillers, A little capons grease, and fasting spittle: I know 'hem, to a dram. Mos. I know not, sir, But some on't, there they powr'd into his eares, Some in his nostrils, and recouer'd him; Applying but the fricace. Corv. Pox o' that fricace. Mos. And since, to seeme the more officious, And flatt'ring of his health, there, they haue had (At extreme fees) the colledge of physicians Consulting on him, how they might restore him; Where, one would haue a cataplasme of spices, Another, a flayd ape clapt to his brest, A third would ha' it a dogge, a fourth an oyle With wild cats skinnes: at last, they all resolu'd That, to preserue him, was no other meanes, But some yong woman must be streight sought out, Lustie, and full of iuice, to sleepe by him; And, to this seruice (most vnhappily, And most vnwillingly) am I now imploy'd, Which, here, I thought to pre-acquaint you with, For your aduice, since it concernes you most, Because, I would not doe that thing might crosse Your ends, on whom I haue my whole dependance, sir: Yet, if I doe it not, they may delate My slacknesse to my patron, worke me out Of his opinion; and there, all your hopes, Venters, or whatsoeuer, are all frustrate. I doe but tell you, sir. Besides, they are all Now striuing, who shall first present him. Thereforeâ I could intreat you, briefly, conclude some-what: Preuent 'hem if you can. Corv. Death to my hopes! This is my villanous fortune! Best to hire Some common curtezan? Mos. I, I thought on that, sir. But they are all so subtle, full of art, And age againe doting, and flexible, So asâI cannot tellâwe may perchance Light on a queane, may cheat vs all. Corv. 'Tis true. Mos. No, no: it must be one, that ha's no trickes, sir, Some simple thing, a creature, made vnto it; Some wench you may command. Ha' you no kinswoman? Gods soâThinke, thinke, thinke, thinke, thinke, thinke, thinke, sir. One o'the Doctors offer'd, there, his daughter. Corv. How! Mos. Yes, signior Lvpo, the physician, Corv. His daughter? Mos. And a virgin, sir. Why? Alasse He knowes the state of's bodie, what it is; That nought can warme his bloud, sir, but a feuer; Nor any incantation rayse his spirit: A long forgetfulnesse hath seiz'd that part. Besides, sir, who shall know it? some one, or twoâ Corv. I pray thee giue me leaue. If any man But I had had this luckeâThe thing in't selfe, I know, is nothingâWherefore should not I As well command my bloud, and my affections, As this dull Doctor? In the point of honour, The cases are all one, of wife, and daughter. Mos. I heare him comming. Corv. Shee shall doo't: 'Tis done. Slight, if this Doctor, who is not engag'd, Vnlesse 't be for his counsell (which is nothing) Offer his daughter, what should I, that am So deeply in? I will preuent him: wretch! Couetous wretch! Mosca, I haue determin'd. Mos. How, sir? Corv. We'll make all sure. The party, you wot of, Shall be mine owne wife, Mosca. Mos. Sir. The thing, (But that I would not seeme to counsell you) I should haue motion'd to you, at the first: And, make your count, you haue cut all their throtes. Why! 'tis directly taking a possession! And, in his next fit, we may let him goe. 'Tis but to pull the pillow, from his head, And he is thratled: 't had beene done, before, But for your scrupulous doubts. Corv. I, a plague on't, My conscience fooles my wit. Well, I'le be briefe, And so be thou, lest they should be before vs; Goe home, prepare him, tell him, with what zeale, And willingnesse, I doe it: sweare it was, On the first hearing (as thou maist doe, truely) Mine owne free motion. Mos. Sir, I warrant you, I'le so possesse him with it, that the rest Of his staru'd clients shall be banisht, all; And onely you receiu'd. But come not, sir, Vntill I send, for I haue some-thing else To ripen, for your good (you must not know't) Corv. But doe not you forget to send, now. Mos. Feare not. Scene VII. Corvino , Celia.

Me thinkes, the lightnesse of the occasion Should ha' confirm'd thee. Come, I am not iealous. Cel. No? Corv. Faith, I am not, I, nor neuer was: It is a poore, vnprofitable humour. Doe not I know, if women haue a will, They'll doe 'gainst all the watches, o' the world? And that the fiercest spies, are tam'd with gold? Tut, I am confident in thee, thou shalt see't: And see, I'le giue thee cause too, to beleeue it. Come, kisse me.

I could skip Out of my skin, now, like a subtill snake, I am so limber. O! Your Parasite Is a most precious thing, dropt from aboue, Not bred 'mong'st clods, and clot-poules, here on earth. I muse, the mysterie was not made a science, It is so liberally profest! almost All the wise world is little else, in nature, But Parasites, or Sub-parasites. And, yet, I meane not those, that haue your bare towne-arte, To know, who's fit to feede 'hem; haue no house, No family, no care, and therefore mould Tales for mens eares, to bait that sense; or get Kitchin-inuention, and some stale receipts To please the belly, and the groine; nor those, With their court-dog-tricks, that can fawne, and fleere, Make their reuennue out of legs, and faces, Eccho my-Lord, and lick away a moath: But your fine, elegant rascall, that can rise, And stoope (almost together) like an arrow; Shoot through the aire, as nimbly as a starre; Turne short, as doth a swallow; and be here, And there, and here, and yonder, all at once; Present to any humour, all occasion; And change a visor, swifter, then a thought!

Nay 'pray thee know thy way, &amp; leaue me: I would be loth to inter-change discourse, With such a mate, as thou art. Mos. Courteous sir, Scorne not my pouertie. Bon. Not I, by heauen: But thou shalt giue me leaue to hate thy basenesse. Mos. Basenesse? Bon. I, answere me, is not thy sloth Sufficient argument? thy flatterie? Thy meanes of feeding? Mos. Heauen, be good to me. These imputations are too common, sir, And eas'ly stuck on vertue, when shee's poore; You are vnequall to me, and how ere Your sentence may be righteous, yet you are not, That ere you know me, thus, proceed in censure: St. Marke beare witnesse 'gainst you, 'tis inhumane.

Sir, it concernes you; and though I may seeme, At first, to make a maine offence, in manners, And in my gratitude, vnto my master, Yet, for the pure loue, which I beare all right, And hatred of the wrong, I must reueale it. This verie houre, your father is in purpose To disinherit youâ Bon. How! Mos. And thrust you forth, As a mere stranger to his bloud; 'tis true, sir: The worke no way ingageth me, but, as I claime an interest in the generall state Of goodnesse, and true vertue, which I heare T'abound in you: and, for which mere respect, Without a second ayme, sir, I haue done it. Bon. This tale hath lost thee much of the late trust, Thou hadst with me; it is impossible: I know not how to lend it any thought, My father should be so vnnaturall. Mos. It is a confidence, that well becomes Your pietie; and form'd (no doubt) it is, From your owne simple innocence: which makes Your wrong more monstrous, and abhor'd. But, sir, I now, will tell you more. This verie minute, It is, or will be doing: And, if you Shall be but pleas'd to goe with me, I'le bring you, (I dare not say where you shall see, but) where Your eare shall be a witnesse of the deed; Heare your selfe written bastard: and profest The common issue of the earth. Bon. I'm maz'd! Mos. Sir, if I doe it not, draw your iust sword, And score your vengeance, on my front, and face; Marke me your villaine: You haue too much wrong, And I doe suffer for you, sir. My heart Weepes bloud, in anguishâ Bon. Lead. I follow thee. Scene III. Volpone , Nano, Androgyno, Castrone. Mosca stayes long, me thinkes. Bring forth your sports And helpe, to make the wretched time more sweet. Nan. Dwarfe, Foole, and Eunuch, well met here we be. A question it were now, whether of vs three, Being all the knowne delicates of a rich man, In pleasing him, claime the precedencie can? Cas. I claime for my selfe. And. And, so doth the foole. Nan. 'Tis foolish indeed: let me set you both to schoole. First, for your dwarfe, hee's little, and wittie, And euery thing, as it is little, is prittie; Else why doe men say to creature of my shape, So soone as they see him, it's a pritty little ape? And, why a pritty ape? but for pleasing imitation Of greater mens action, in a ridiculous fashion. Beside, this feat body of mine doth not craue Halfe the meat, drinke, and cloth, one of your bulkes will haue. Admit, your fooles face be the mother of laughter, Yet, for his braine, it must alwaies come after: And, though that doe feed him, it's a pittifull case, His body is beholding to such a bad face. One knocks. Volp. Who's there? my couch, away, looke, Nano, see: Giue me my cappes, firstâgo, enquire. Now, Cvpid Send it be Mosca, and with faire returne. Nan. It is the beauteous madamâ Volp. Wovld-beâis it? Nan. The same. Volp. Now, torment on me; squire her in: For she will enter, or dwell here for euer. Nay, quickely, that my fit were past. I feare A second hell too, that my loathing this Will quite expell my appetite to the other: Would shee were taking, now, her tedious leaue. Lord, how it threates me, what I am to suffer! Scene IIII. Lady , Volpone, Nano, Women. 2. I thanke you, good sir. 'Pray you signifie Vnto your patron, I am here. This band Shewes not my neck though (I trouble you, sir, Let me request you, bid one of my women Come hither to me) in good faith, I, am drest Most fauourably, to day, it is no matter, 'Tis well inough. Looke, see, these petulant things! How they haue done this! Volp. I do feele the feuer Entring, in at mine eares; Ã´, for a charme, To fright it hence. Lad. Come neerer: is this curle In his right place? or this? why is this higher Then all the rest? you ha' not wash'd your eies, yet? Or do they not stand euen i'your head? Where's your fellow? call her. Nan. Now, St. Marke Deliuer vs: anon, shee'll beate her women, Because her nose is red. Lad. I pray you, view This tire, forsooth: are all things apt, or no? Wom. One haire a little, here, sticks out, forsooth. Lad. Do's 't so forsooth? and where was your deare sight When it did so, forsooth? what now? bird-ey'd? And you, too? 'pray you both approch, and mend it. Now (by that light) I muse, yo' are not asham'd! I, that haue preach'd these things, so oft, vnto you, Read you the principles, argu'd all the grounds, Disputed euery fitnesse, euery grace, Call'd you to counsell of so frequent dressingsâ Nan. (More carefully, then of your fame, or honour) Lad. Made you acquainted, what an ample dowrie The knowledge of these things would be vnto you, Able, alone, to get you noble husbands At your returne: and you, thus, to neglect it? Besides, you seeing what a curious nation Th'Italians are, what will they say of me? The English lady cannot dresse her selfe; Here's a fine imputation, to our countrie! Well, goe your wayes, and stay, i' the next roome. This fucus was too course too, it's no matter. Good-sir, you'll giue 'hem entertaynement? Volp. The storme comes toward me. Lad. How do's my Volp? Volp. Troubled with noise, I cannot sleepe; I dreamt That a strange furie entred, now, my house, And, with the dreadfull tempest of her breath, Did cleaue my roofe asunder. Lad. Beleeue me, and I Had the most fearefull dreame, could I remember'tâ Volp. Out on my fate; I ha' giu'n her the occasion How to torment me: shee will tell me hers. Lad. Me thought, the golden mediocritie Polite, and delicateâ Volp. O, if you doe loue me, No more; I sweat, and suffer, at the mention Of any dreame: feele, how I tremble yet. Lad. Alas, good soule! the passion of the heart. Seed-pearle were good now, boild with syrrope of apples, Tincture of gold, and corrall, citron-pills, Your elicampane roote, mirobalanesâ Volp. Ay me, I haue tane a grasse-hopper by the wing. Lad. Burnt silke, and amber, you haue muscadell Good i' the houseâ Volp. You will not drinke, and part? Lad. No, feare not that. I doubt, we shall not get Some english saffron (halfe a dram would serue) Your sixteene cloues, a little muske, dri'd mints, Buglosse, and barley-mealeâ Volp. Shee's in againe, Before I fayn'd diseases, now I haue one. Lad. And these appli'd, with a right scarlet-clothâ Volp. Another floud of wordes! a very torrent! Lad. Shall I, sir, make you a poultise? Volp. No, no, no; I'am very well: you need prescribe no more. Lad. I haue, a little, studied physick; but, now, I'am all for musique: saue, i' the fore-noones, An houre, or two, for painting. I would haue A lady, indeed, t'haue all, letters, and artes, Be able to discourse, to write, to paint, But principall (as Plato holds) your musique (And, so do's wise Pythagoras, I take it) Is your true rapture; when there is concent In face, in voyce, and clothes: and is, indeed, Our sexes chiefest ornament. Volp. The Poet, As old in time, as Plato, and as knowing, Say's that your highest female grace is silence. Lad. Which o' your Poets? Petrarch? or Tasso? or Dante? Gverrini? Ariosto? Aretine? Cieco di Hadria? I haue read them all. Volp. Is euery thing a cause, to my destruction? Lad. I thinke, I ha' two or three of 'hem, about me. Volp. The sunne, the sea will sooner, both, stand still, Then her eternall tongue! nothing can scape it. Lad. Here's Pastor Fidoâ Volp. Professe obstinate silence, That's, now, my safest. Lad. All our English writers, I meane such, as are happy in th'Italian, Will deigne to steale out of this author, mainely; Almost as much, as from Montagnie: He has so moderne, and facile a veine, Fitting the time, and catching the court-eare. Your Petrarch is more passionate, yet he, In dayes of sonetting, trusted 'hem, with much: Dante is hard, and few can vnderstand him. But, for a desperate wit, there's Aretine! Onely, his pictures are a little obsceneâ You marke me not? Volp. Alas, my mind's perturb'd. Lad. Why, in such cases, we must cure our selues, Make vse of our philosophieâ Volp. O'y me. Lad. And, as we find our passions doe rebell, Encounter 'hem with reason; or diuert 'hem, By giuing scope vnto some other humour Of lesser danger: as, in politique bodies, There's nothing, more, doth ouer-whelme the iudgement, And clouds the vnderstanding, then too much Settling, and fixing, and (as't were) subsiding Vpon one obiect. For the incorporating Of these same outward things, into that part, Which we call mentall, leaues some certaine faces, That stop the organs, and, as Plato sayes, Assassinates our knowledge. Volp. Now, the spirit Of patience helpe me. Lad. Come, in faith, I must Visit you more, a dayes; and make you well: Laugh, and be lusty. Volp. My good angell saue me. Lad. There was but one sole man, in all the world, With whom I ere could sympathize; and he Would lie you often, three, foure houres together, To heare me speake: and be (sometime) so rap't, As he would answere me, quite from the purpose, Like you, and you are like him, iust. I'le discourse (And 't be but only, sir, to bring you a-sleepe) How we did spend our time, and loues, together, For some sixe yeeres. Volp. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Lad. For we were coÃ¦tanci and brought vpâ Volp. Some power, some fate, some fortune rescue me. Scene V. Mosca , Lady, Volpone. God saue you, Madam. Lad. Good sir. Volp. Mosca? welcom, Welcome to my redemption. Mos. Why, sir? Volp. Oh, Rid me of this my torture, quickly, there; My Madam, with the euerlasting voyce: The bells, in time of pestilence, ne're made Like noise, or were in that perpetuall motion; The cock-pit comes not neere it. All my house, But now, steam'd like a bath, with her thicke breath. A lawyer could not haue beene heard; nor scarse Another woman, such a hayle of wordes Shee has let fall. For hells sake, rid her hence. Mos. Has shee presented? Volp. O, I doe not care, I'le take her absence, vpon any price, With any losse. Mos. Madamâ Lad. I ha' brought your patron A toy, a cap here, of mine owne workeâ Mos. 'Tis well, I had forgot to tell you, I saw your Knight, Where you'ld little thinke itâ Lad. Where? Mos. Mary, Where yet, if you make haste, you may apprehend him, Rowing vpon the water in a gondole, With the most cunning curtizan, of Venice. Lad. Is't true? Mos. Pursue 'hem, and beleeue your eyes: Leaue me, to make your gift. I knew, 't would take. For lightly, they that vse themselues most licence, Are still most iealous. Volp. Mosca, hearty thankes, For thy quicke fiction, and deliuery of mee. Now, to my hopes, what saist thou? Lad. But doe you heare, sir?â Volp. Againe; I feare a paroxisme. Lad. Which way Row'd they together? Mos. Toward the rialto. Lad. I pray you lend me your dwarfe. Mos. I pray you, take him. Your hopes, sir, are like happie blossomes, faire, And promise timely fruit, if you will stay But the maturing; keepe you, at your couch, Corbaccio will arriue straight, with the will: When he is gone, ile tell you more. Volp. My blood, My spirits are return'd; I am aliue: And like your wanton gam'ster, at primero, Whose thought had whisper'd to him, not goe lesse, Me thinkes I lie, and drawâfor an encounter. Scene VI. Mosca , Bonario. Sir, here conceald, you may heare all. But 'pray you Haue patience, sir; the same's your father, knocks: One knockes. I am compeld, to leaue you. Bon. Do so. Yet, Cannot my thought imagine this a truth. Scene. VII. Mosca , Corvino, Celia, Bonario, Volpone. Death on me! you are come too soone, what meant you? Did not I say, I would send? Corv. Yes, but I feard You might forget it, and then they preuent vs. Mos. Preuent? did ere man haste so, for his hornes? A courtier would not ply it so, for a place. Well, now there's no helping it, stay here; Ile presently returne. Corv. Where are you, Celia? You know not wherefore I haue brought you hither? Cel. Not well, except you told me. Corv. Now, I will: Harke hither. Mos. Sir, your father hath sent word, To Bonario. It will be halfe an houre, ere he come; And therefore, if you please to walke, the while, Into that galleryâat the vpper end, There are some bookes, to entertaine the time: And ile take care, no man shall come vnto you, sir. Bon. Yes, I will stay there, I doe doubt this fellow. Mos. There, he is farre enough; he can heare nothing: And, for his father, I can keepe him off. Corv. Nay, now, there is no starting backe; and therefore, Resolue vpon it: I haue so decree'd. It must be done. Nor, would I moue't afore, Because I would auoide all shifts and tricks, That might denie me. Cel. Sir, let me beseech you, Affect not these strange trials; if you doubt My chastitie, why locke me vp, for euer: Make me the heyre of darkenesse. Let me liue, Where I may please your feares, if not your trust. Corv. Beleeue it, I haue no such humor, I. All that I speake, I meane; yet I am not mad: Not horne-mad, see you? Go too, shew your selfe Obedient, and a wife. Cel. O heauen! Corv. I say it, Do so. Cel. Was this the traine? Corv. I haue told you reasons; What the physitians haue set downe; how much, It may concerne me; what my engagements are; My meanes; and the necessitie of those meanes, For my recouery: wherefore, if you bee Loyall, and mine, be wonne, respect my venture. Cel. Before your honour? Corv. Honour? tut, a breath; There's no such thing, in nature: a meere terme Inuented to awe fooles. What is my gold The worse, for touching? clothes, for being look'd on? Why, this 's no more. An old, decrepit wretch, That ha's no sense, no sinew; takes his meate With others fingers; onely knowes to gape, When you doe scald his gummes; a voice; a shadow; And, what can this man hurt you? Cel. Lord! what spirit Is this hath entred him? Corv. And for your fame, That's such a Iigge; as if I would goe tell it, Crie it, on the piazza! who shall know it? But hee, that cannot speake it; and this fellow, Whose lippes are i' my pocket: saue your selfe, If you'll proclaime't, you may. I know no other, Should come to know it. Cel. Are heauen, and saints then nothing? Will they be blinde, or stupide? Corv. How? Cel. Good Sir, Be iealous still, Ã¦mulate them; and thinke What hate they burne with, toward euery sinne. Corv. I grant you: if I thought it were a sinne, I would not vrge you. Should I offer this To some yong Frenchman, or hot Tuscane bloud, That had read Aretine, conn'd all his printes, Knew euery quirke within lusts laborinth, And were profest critique, in lechery; And I would looke vpon him, and applaud him, This were a sinne: but here, 'tis contrary, A pious worke, mere charity, for physick, And honest politie, to assure mine owne. Cel. O heauen! canst thou suffer such a change? Volp. Thou art mine honor, Mosca, and my pride, My ioy, my tickling, my delight! goe, bring 'hem. Mos. Please you draw neere, sir. Corv. Come on, whatâ You will not be rebellious? by that lightâ Mos. Sir, signior Corvino, here, is come to see you. Volp. Oh. Mos. And hearing of the consultation had, So lately, for your health, is come to offer, Or rather, sir, to prostituteâ Corv. Thankes, sweet Mosca. Mos. Freely, vn-ask'd, or vn-intreatedâ Corv. Well. Mos. (As the true, feruent instance of his loue) His owne most faire and proper wife; the beauty, Onely of price, in Veniceâ Corv. 'Tis well vrg'd. Mos. To be your comfortresse, and to preserue you. Volp. Alasse, I am past already! 'pray you, thanke him, For his good care, and promptnesse, but for that, 'Tis a vaine labour, eene to fight, 'gainst heauen; Applying fire to a stone: (vh, vh, vh, vh.) Making a dead leafe grow againe. I take His wishes gently, though; and, you may tell him, What I' haue done for him: mary, my state is hopelesse! Will him, to pray for me; and t'vse his fortune, With reuerence, when he comes to't. Mos. Do you heare, sir? Go to him, with your wife. Corv. Heart of my father! Wilt thou persist thus? come, I pray thee, come. Thou seest 'tis nothing. Celia. By this hand, I shall grow violent. Come, do't, I say. Cel. Sir, kill me, rather: I will take downe poyson, Eate burning coales, doe any thingâ Corv. Be damn'd. (Heart) I will drag thee hence, home, by the haire; Cry thee a strumpet, through the streets; rip vp Thy mouth, vnto thine eares; and slit thy nose, Like a raw rotchetâDo not tempt me, come. Yeld, I am lothâ(Death) I will buy some slaue, Whom I will kill, and binde thee to him, aliue; And at my windore, hang you forth: deuising Some monstrous crime, which I, in capitall letters, Will eate into thy flesh, with aqua-fortis, And burning cor'siues, on this stubborne brest. Now, by the bloud, thou hast incens'd, ile do't. Cel. Sir, what you please, you may, I am your martyr. Corv. Be not thus obstinate, I ha' not deseru'd it: Thinke, who it is, intreats you. 'Pray thee, sweet; (Good faith) thou shalt haue iewells, gownes, attires, What thou wilt thinke, and aske. Do, but, go kisse him. Or touch him, but. For my sake. At my sute. This once. No? not? I shall remember this. Will you disgrace me, thus? do you thirst my 'vndoing? Mos. Nay, gentle lady, be aduis'd. Corv. No, no. She has watch'd her time. God's precious, this is skiruy; 'Tis very skiruie: and you areâ Mos. Nay, good, sir. Corv. An errant locust, by heauen, a locust. Whore, Crocodile, that hast thy thy teares prepar'd, Expecting, how thou'lt bid 'hem flow. Mos. Nay, 'Pray you, sir, Shee will consider. Cel. Would my life would serue To satisfie. Corv. (S'death) if shee would but speake to him, And saue my reputation, 'twere somewhat; But, spightfully to affect my vtter ruine. Mos. I, now you' haue put your fortune, in her hands. Why i'faith, it is her modesty, I must quit her; If you were absent, shee would be more comming; I know it: and dare vndertake for her. What woman can, before her husband? 'pray you, Let vs depart, and leaue her, here. Corv. Sweet Celia, Thou mayst redeeme all, yet; I'le say no more: If not, esteeme your selfe as lost. Nay, stay there. Cel. O god, and his good angels! whether, whether. Is shame fled humane brests? that with such ease, Men dare put off your honours, and their owne? Is that, which euer was a cause of life, Now plac'd beneath the basest circumstance? And modestie an exile made, for money? He leapes off from his couch: Volp. I, in Corvino, and such earth-fed mindes, That neuer tasted the true heau'n of loue. Assure thee, Celia, he that would sell thee, Onely for hope of gaine, and that vncertaine, He would haue sold his part of paradise For ready money, had he met a cope-man. Why art thou maz'd, to see me thus reuiu'd? Rather applaud thy beauties miracle; 'Tis thy great worke: that hath, not now alone, But sundry times, 'rays'd me, in seuerall shapes, And, but this morning, like a mountebanke, To see thee at thy windore. I, before I would haue left my practice, for thy loue, In varying figures, I would haue contended With the blue Protevs, or the horned Floud. Now, art thou welcome. Cel. Sir! Volp. Nay, flie me not. Nor, let thy false imagination That I was bedrid, make thee thinke, I am so: Thou shalt not find it. I am, now, as fresh, As hot, as high, and in as iouiall plight, As when (in that so celebrated scene, At recitation of our comÅdie, For entertainement of the great Valoys) I acted yong Antinovs; and attracted The eyes, and eares of all the ladies, present, T'admire each gracefull gesture, note, and footing. Song. Come, my Celia, let vs proue, While we can, the sports of loue; Time will not be ours, for euer, He, at length, our good will seuer; Spend not then his gifts, in vaine. Sunnes, that set, may rise againe: But if, once, we lose this light, 'Tis with vs perpetuall night. Why should wee deferre our ioyes? Fame, and rumor are but toies. Cannot we delude the eyes Of a few poore houshold-spies? Or his easier eares beguile, Thus remooued, by our wile? 'Tis no sinne, loues fruits to steale; But the sweet thefts to reueale: To be taken, to be seene, These haue crimes accounted beene. Cel. Some serene blast me, or dire lightning strike This my offending face. Volp. Why droopes my Celia? Thou hast in place of a base husband, found A worthy louer: vse thy fortune well, With secrecie, and pleasure. See, behold, What thou art queene of; not in expectation, As I feed others: but possess'd, and crown'd. See, here, a rope of pearle; and each, more orient Then that the braue Ãgyptian queene carrous'd: Dissolue, and drinke 'hem. See, a carbuncle, May put out both the eyes of our St. Marke; A diamant, would haue bought Lollia Pavlina, When she came in, like star-light hid with iewels, That were the spoiles of prouinces; take these, And weare, and loose 'hem: yet remaines an eare-ring To purchase them againe, and this whole state. A gem, but worth a priuate patrimony, Is nothing: we will eate such at a meale. The heads of parrats, tongues of nightingales, The braines of peacocks, and of estriches Shall be our food: and, could we get the phÅnix, (Though nature lost her kind) shee were our dish. Cel. Good sir, these things might moue a minde affected With such delights; but I, whose innocence Is all I can thinke wealthy, or worth th'enioying, And which once lost, I haue nought to loose beyond it, Cannot be taken with these sensuall baites: If you haue conscienceâ Volp. 'Tis the beggers vertue, If thou hast wisdome, heare me, Celia. Thy bathes shall be the iuyce of iuly-flowres, Spirit of roses, and of violets, The milke of vnicornes, and panthers breath Gather'd in bagges, and mixt with cretan wines. Our drinke shall be prepared gold, and amber; Which we will take, vntill my roofe whirle round With the vertigo: and my dwarfe shall dance, My eunuch sing, my foole make vp the antique. Whil'st, we, in changed shapes, act Ovids tales, Thou, like Evropa now, and I like Iove, Then I like Mars, and thou like Erycine, So, of the rest, till we haue quite run through And weary'd all the fables of the gods. Then will I haue thee in more moderne formes, Attired like some sprightly dame of France, Braue Tuscan lady, or proud Spanish beauty; Sometimes, vnto the Persian Sophies wife; Or the grand-Signiors mistresse; and, for change, To one of our most art-full courtizans, Or some quick Negro, or cold Russian; And I will meet thee, in as many shapes: Where we may, so, trans-fuse our wandring soules, Out at our lippes, and score vp summes of pleasures, That the curious shall not know, How to tell them, as they flow; And the enuious, when they find What their number is, be pind. Cel. If you haue eares that will be pierc'd; or eyes, That can be open'd; a heart, may be touch'd; Or any part, that yet sounds man, about you: If you haue touch of holy saints, or heauen, Do me the grace, to let me scape. If not, Be bountifull, and kill me. You doe know, I am a creature, hither ill betrayd, By one, whose shame I would forget it were, If you will daigne me neither of these graces, Yet feed your wrath, sir, rather then your lust; (It is a vice, comes neerer manlinesse) And punish that vnhappy crime of nature, Which you miscal my beauty: flay my face, Or poison it, with oyntments, for seducing Your bloud to this rebellion. Rub these hands, With what may cause an eating leprosie, E'ene to my bones, and marrow: any thing, That may disfauour me, saue in my honour. And I will kneele to you, pray for you, pay downe A thousand hourely vowes, sir, for your health, Report, and thinke you vertuousâ Volp. Thinke me cold, Frosen, and impotent, and so report me? That I had Nestor's hernia, thou wouldst thinke. I doe degenerate, and abuse my nation, To play with oportunity, thus long: I should haue done the act, and then haue parlee'd. Yeeld, or Ile force thee. Cel. O! iust God. Volp. In vaineâ Bon. Forbeare, foule rauisher, libidinous swine, He leapes out from where Mosca had plac'd him. Free the forc'd lady, or thou dy'st, impostor. But that I am loth to snatch thy punishment Out of the hand of iustice, thou shouldst, yet, Be made the timely sacrifice of vengeance, Before this altar, and this drosse, thy idoll. Lady, let's quit the place, it is the den Of villany; feare nought, you haue a guard: And he, ere long, shall meet his iust reward. Volp. Fall on me, roofe, and bury me in ruine, Become my graue, that wert my shelter. O! I am vn-masqu'd, vn-spirited, vn-done, Betray'd to beggery, to infamyâ Scene VIII. Mosca , Volpone. VVhere shall I runne, most wretched shame of men, To beate out my vn-luckie braines? Volp. Here, here. What! dost thou bleed? Mos. O, that his wel-driu'n sword Had beene so courteous to haue cleft me downe, Vnto the nauill; ere I liu'd to see My life, my hopes, my spirits, my patron, all Thus desperately engaged, by my error. Volp. Woe, on thy fortune. Mos. And my follies, sir. Volp. Th'hast made me miserable. Mos. And my selfe, sir. Who would haue thought, he would haue harken'd, so? Volp. What shall we do? Mos. I know not, if my heart Could expiate the mischance, Il'd pluck it out. Will you be pleas'd to hang me? or cut my throate? And i'le requite you, sir. Let's die like Romanes, They knock without. Since wee haue liu'd, like Grecians. Volp. Harke, who's there? I heare some footing, officers, the Saffi, Come to apprehend vs! I doe feele the brand Hissing already, at my fore-head: now, Mine eares are boring. Mos. To your couch, sir, you Make that place good, how euer. Guilty men Suspect, what they deserue still. Signior Corbaccio! Scene IX. Corbaccio , Mosca, Voltore, Volpone. Why! how now? Mosca! Mos. O, vndone, amaz'd, sir. Your sonne (I know not, by what accident) Acquainted with your purpose to my patron, Touching your will, and making him your heire; Entred our house with violence, his sword drawne, Sought for you, call'd you wretch, vnnaturall, Vow'd he would kill you. Corb. Me? Mos. Yes, and my patron. Corb. This act, shall disinherit him indeed: Here is the will. Mos. 'Tis well, sir. Corb. Right and well. Be you as carefull now, for me. Mos. My life, sir, Is not more tender'd, I am onely yours. Corb. How do's he? will he die shortly, think'st thou? Mos. I feare. He'll out-last May. Corb. Today? Mos. No, last-out May, sir. Corb. Couldst thou not gi' him a dram? Mos. O, by no meanes, sir. Corb. Nay, I'le not bid you. Volt. This is a knaue, I see. Mos. How, signior Voltore! did he heare me? Volt. Parasite. Mos. Who's that? O, sir, most timely welcomeâ Volt. Scarse, To the discouery of your tricks, I feare. You are his, onely? and mine, also? are you not? Mos. Who? I, sir! Volt. You, sir. What deuice is this About a will? Mos. A plot for you, sir. Volt. Come, Put not your foist's vpon me, I shall sent 'hem. Mos. Did you not heare it? Volt. Yes, I heare, Corbaccio Hath made your patron, there, his heire. Mos. 'Tis true, By my deuice, drawne to it by my plot, With hopeâ Volt. Your patron should reciprocate? And, you haue promis'd? Mos. For your good, I did, sir. Nay more, I told his sonne, brought, hid him here, Where he might heare his father passe the deed; Being perswaded to it, by this thought, sir, That the vnnaturalnesse, first, of the act, And then, his fathers oft disclaiming in him, (Which I did meane t'helpe on) would sure enrage him To doe some violence vpon his parent. On which the law should take sufficient hold, And you be stated in a double hope: Truth be my comfort, and my conscience, My onely ayme was, to dig you a fortune Out of these two, old rotten sepulchersâ Volt. (I cry thee mercy, Mosca.) Mos. Worth your patience, And your great merit, sir. And, see the change! Volt. Why? what successe? Mos. Most haplesse! you must helpe, sir. Whilst we expected th'old rauen, in comes Corvino's wife, sent hither, by her husbandâ Volt. What, with a present? Mos. No, sir, on visitation: (I'le tell you how, anone) and, staying long, The youth, he growes impatient, rushes forth, Seizeth the lady, wound's me, makes her sweare (Or he would murder her, that was his vow) T'affirme my patron to haue done her rape: Which how vnlike it is, you see! and, hence, With that pretext, hee's gone, t'accuse his father; Defame my patron; defeate youâ Volt. Where's her husband? Let him be sent for, streight. Mos. Sir, I'le goe fetch him. Volt. Bring him, to the Scrutineo. Mos. Sir, I will. Volt. This must be stopt. Mos. O, you do nobly, sir. Alasse, 'twas labor'd all, sir, for your good; Nor, was there want of counsel, in the plot: But fortune can, at any time, orethrow The proiects of a hundred learned clearkes, sir. Corb. What's that? Volt. Wilt please you sir, to goe along? Mos. Patron, go in, and pray for our successe. Volp. Neede makes deuotion: heauen your labor blesse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IIII. Scene I. Politiqve , Peregrine. I told you, sir, it was a plot: you see What obseruation is. You mention'd mee, For some instructions: I will tell you, sir, (Since we are met, here in this height of Venice) Some few particulars, I haue set downe, Onely for this meridian; fit to be knowne Of your crude traueller, and they are these. I will not touch, sir, at your phrase, or clothes, For they are old. Per. Sir, I haue better. Pol. Pardon I meant, as they are theames. Per. O, sir, proceed: I'le slander you no more of wit, good sir. Pol. First, for your garbe, it must be graue, and serious; Very reseru'd, and lock't; not tell a secret, On any termes, not to your father; scarse A fable, but with caution; make sure choise Both of your company, and discourse; beware, You neuer spake a truthâ Per. How! Pol. Not to strangers, For those be they you must conuerse with, most; Others I would not know, sir, but, at distance, So as I still might be a sauer, in 'hem: You shall haue tricks, else, past vpon you, hourely. And then, for your religion, professe none; But wonder, at the diuersitie of all; And, for your part, protest, were there no other But simply the lawes o'th' land, you could content you: Nic: Machiavel, and monsieur Bodine, both, Were of this minde. Then, must you learne the vse, And handling of your siluer forke, at meales; The mettall of your glasse: (these are maine matters, With your Italian) and to know the houre, When you must eat your melons, and your figges. Per. Is that a point of state, too? Pol. Here it is. For your Venetian, if he see a man Preposterous, in the least, he has him straight; He has: he strippes him. I'le acquaint you, sir, I now haue liu'd here ('tis some fourteene monthes) Within the first weeke, of my landing here, All tooke me for a citizen of Venice: I knew the formes, so wellâ Per. And nothing else. Pol. I had read Contarene, tooke me a house, Dealt with my Iewes, to furnish it with moueablesâ Well, if I could but finde one man, one man, To mine owne heart, whom I durst trust, I wouldâ Per. What? what, sir? Pol. Make him rich; make him a fortune: He should not thinke, againe. I would command it. Per. As how? Pol. With certaine proiects, that I haue: Which, I may not discouer. Per. If I had But one to wager with, I would lay odds, now, He tels me, instantly. Pol. One is, (and that I care not greatly, who knowes) to serue the state Of Venice, with red herrings, for three yeeres, And at a certaine rate, from Roterdam, Where I haue correspondence. There's a letter, Sent me from one o'th' States, and to that purpose; He cannot write his name, but that's his marke. Per. He is a chaundler? Pol. No, a cheesemonger. There are some other too, with whom I treate, About the same negotiation; And, I will vndertake it: For, 'tis thus, I'le do't with ease, I' haue cast it all. Your hoigh Carries but three men in her, and a boy; And she shall make me three returnes, a yeare: So, if there come but one of three, I saue, If two, I can defalke. But, this is now, If my mayne proiect faile. Per. Then, you haue others? Pol. I should be loath to draw the subtill ayre Of such a place, without my thousand aymes. Ile not dissemble, sir, where ere I come, I loue to be consideratiue; and, 'tis true, I haue, at my free houres, thought vpon Some certaine goods, vnto the state of Venice, Which I doe call my cautions: and, sir, which I meane (in hope of pension) to propound To the great councell, then vnto the forty, So to the ten. My meanes are made alreadyâ Per. By whom? Pol. Sir, one, that though his place b'obscure, Yet, he can sway, and they will heare him. H'is A commandadore. Per. What, a common sergeant? Pol. Sir, such, as they are, put it in their mouthes, What they should say, sometimes: as well as greater. I thinke I haue my notes, to shew youâ Per. Good, sir, Pol. But, you shall sweare vnto me, on your gentry, Not to anticipateâ Per. I, sir? Pol. Nor reueale A circumstanceâMy paper is not with mee. Per. O, but, you can remember, sir. Pol. My first is, Concerning tinder-boxes. You must know, No family is, here, without it's boxe. Now sir, it being so portable a thing, Put case, that you, or I were ill affected Vnto the state; sir, with it in our pockets, Might not I goe into the arsenale? Or you? come out againe? and none the wiser? Per. Except your selfe, sir. Pol. Goe too, then. I, therefore, Aduertise to the state, how fit it were, That none, but such as were knowne patriots, Sound louers of their countrey, should be sufferd T'enioy them in their houses: and, euen those, Seal'd, at some office, and, at such a bignesse, As might not lurke in pockets. Per. Admirable! Pol. My next is, how t'enquire, and be resolu'd, By present demonstration, whether a ship, Newly arriued from Soria, or from Any suspected part of all the leuant, Be guilty of the plague: And, where they vse, To lie out fortie, fifty daies, sometimes, About the Lazaretto, for their triall; Ile saue that charge, and losse vnto the merchant, And, in an houre, cleare the doubt. Per. Indeede, sir? Pol. OrâI will loose my labour. Per. 'My faith, that's much. Pol. Nay, sir, conceiue me. 'Twill cost me, in onions, Some thirtie liu'resâ Per. Which is one pound sterling. Pol. Beside my water-workes: for this I doe, sir. First, I bring in your ship, 'twixt two brickwalles; (But those the state shall venter) on the one I straine me a faire tarre-paulin; and, in that, I stick my onions, cut in halfes: the other Is full of loope-holes, out at which, I thrust The noses of my bellowes; and, those bellowes I keepe, with water-workes, in perpetuall motion, (Which is the easi'st matter of a hundred) Now, sir, your onion, which doth naturally Attract th'infection, and your bellowes, blowing The ayre vpon him, will shew (instantly) By his chang'd colour, if there be contagion, Or else, remaine as faire, as at the first. Now 'tis knowne, 'tis nothing. Per. You are right, sir. Pol. I would, I had my note. Per. 'Faith, so would I: But, you ha' done well, for once, sir. Pol. Were I false, Or would be made so, I could shew you reasons, How I could sell this state, now, to the Turke; Spight of their galleis, or theirâ Per. Pray you, sir Poll. Pol. I haue 'hem not, about me. Per. That I fear'd. They are there, sir? Pol. No, this is my diary, Wherein I note my actions of the day. Per. 'Pray you, let's see, sir. What is here? notandum, A rat had gnawne my spurre-lethers; notwithstanding, I put on new, and did goe forth: but, first, I threw three beanes ouer the threshold. Item, I went, and bought two tooth-pickes, whereof one I burst, immediatly, in a discourse With a dutch merchant, 'bout ragion del stato. From him I went, and payd a moccinigo, For peecing my silke stockings; by the way, I cheapen'd sprats: and at St. Markes, I vrin'd. 'Faith, these are politique notes! Pol. Sir, I do slippe No action of my life, thus, but I quote it. Per. Beleeue me it is wise! Pol. Nay, sir, read forth. Scene II. Lady , Nano, Women, Politiqve, Peregrine. VVhere should this loose knight be, trow? sure, h'is hous'd. Nan. Why, then he's fast. Lad. I, he plaies both, with me: I pray you, stay. This heate will doe more harme To my complexion, then his heart is worth. (I do not care to hinder, but to take him) How it comes of! Wom. My master's yonder. Lad. Where? Wom. With a yong gentleman. Lad. That same's the party! In mans apparell. 'Pray you, sir, iog my knight: I will be tender to his reputation, How euer he demerit. Pol. My lady! Per. Where? Pol. 'Tis shee indeed, sir, you shall know her. She is, Were she not mine, a lady of that merit, For fashion, and behauiour; and, for beauty I durst compareâ Per. It seemes, you are not iealous, That dare commend her. Pol. Nay, and for discourseâ Per. Being your wife, shee cannot misse that. Pol. Madame, Here is a gentleman, 'pray you, vse him, fairely, He seemes a youth, but he isâ Lad. None? Pol. Yes, one Has put his face, as soone, into the worldâ Lad. You meane, as earely? but to day? Pol. How's this! Lad. Why in this habit, sir, you apprehend me. Well, master Wovld-bee, this doth not become you; I had thought, the odour, sir, of your good name, Had beene more precious to you; that you would not Haue done this dire massacre, on your honour; One of your grauity, and ranke, besides! But, knights, I see, care little for the oath They make to ladies: chiefely, their owne ladies. Pol. Now, by my spurres (the symbole of my knight-hood) Per. (Lord! how his braine is humbled, for an oath) Pol. I reach you not. Lad. Right, sir, your politie May beare it through, thus. Sir, a word with you. I would be loth, to contest publikely, With any gentlewoman; or to seeme Froward, or violent (as the courtier sayes) It comes too neere rusticity, in a lady, Which I would shun, by all meanes: and, how-euer I may deserue from master Wovld-bee, yet, T'haue one faire gentlewoman, thus, be made Th'vnkind instrument, to wrong another, And one she knowes not, I, and to perseuer; In my poore iudgement, is not warranted From being a solÅcisme in our sexe, If not in manners. Per. How is this! Pol. Sweet madame, Come neerer to your ayme. Lad. Mary, and will, sir. Since you prouoke me, with your impudence, And laughter of your light land-siren, here, Your Sporvs, your hermaphroditeâ Per. What's here? Poetique fury, and historique stormes! Pol. The gentleman, beleeue it, is of worth, And of our nation. Lad I, your white-Friers nation? Come, I blush for you, master Wovld-bee, I; And am asham'd, you should ha' no more forehead, Then, thus, to be the patron, or St. George To a lewd harlot, a base fricatrice, A female deuill, in a male out-side. Pol. Nay, And you be such a one! I must bid adieu To your delights. The case appeares too liquide. Lad. I, you may carry't cleare, with your state-face! But, for your carniuale concupiscence, Who here is fled for liberty of conscience, From furious persecution of the Marshall, Her will I disc'ple. Per. This is fine, i'faith! And do you vse this, often? is this part Of your wits exercise, 'gainst you haue occasion? Madamâ Lad. Go to, sir. Per. Do you heare me, lady? Why, if your knight haue set you to begge shirts, Or to inuite me home, you might haue done it A neerer way, by farre. Lad. This cannot work you, Out of my snare. Per. Why? am I in it, then? Indeede, your husband told me, you were faire, And so you are; onely your nose enclines (That side, that's next the sunne) to the queene-apple. Lad. This cannot be endur'd, by any patience. Scene III. Mosca , Lady, Peregrine. What's the matter, madame? Lad. If the Senate Right not my quest, in this; I will protest 'hem, To all the world, no aristocracie. Mos. What is the iniurie, lady? Lad. Why, the callet, You told me of, here I haue tane disguis'd. Mos. Who? this? what meanes your ladiship? the creature I mention'd to you, is apprehended, now, Before the Senate, you shall see herâ Lad. Where? Mos. I'le bring you to her. This yong gentleman I saw him land, this morning, at the port. Lad. Is't possible! how has my iudgement wander'd! Sir, I must, blushing, say to you, I haue err'd: And plead your pardon. Per. What! more changes, yet? Lad. I hope, yo' ha' not the malice to remember A gentlewomans passion. If you stay, In Venice, here, please you to vse me, sirâ Mos. Will you go, madame? Lad. 'Pray you, sir, vse mee. In faith, The more you see me, the more I shall conceiue, You haue forgot our quarrell. Per. This is rare! Sir Politiqve Wovld-bee? no, sir Politiqve bawd! To bring me, thus, acquainted with his wife! Well, wise sir Pol: since you haue practis'd, thus, Vpon my freshman-ship, I'le trie your salt-head, What proofe it is against a counter-plot. Scene IIII. Voltore, Corbaccio, Corvino, Mosca. Well, now you know the carriage of the businesse, Your constancy is all, that is requir'd Vnto the safety of it. Mos. Is the lie Safely conuai'd amongst vs? is that sure? Knowes euery man his burden? Corv. Yes. Mos. Then, shrink not. Corv. But, knowes the Aduocate the truth? Mos. O, sir, By no meanes. I deuis'd a formall tale, That salu'd your reputation. But, be valiant, sir. Corv. I feare no one, but him; that, this his pleading Should make him stand for a co-heireâ Mos. Co-halter. Hang him: we will but vse his tongue, his noise, As we doe croakers, here. Corv. I, what shall he do? Mos. When we ha' done, you meane? Corv. Yes. Mos. Why, we'll thinke, Sell him for mummia hee's halfe dust already. To Voltore. Do not you smile, to see this buffalo, How he doth sport it with his head?âI' should To Corbaccio. If all were well, and past. Sir, onely you Are he, that shall enioy the crop of all, And these not know for whom they toile. Corb. I, peace. To Coruino then to Voltore againe. Mos. But you shall eate it. Much! Worshipfull sir, Mercvry sit vpon your thundring tongue, Or the French Hercvles, and make your language As conquering as his club, to beate along, (As with a tempest) flat, our aduersaries: But, much more, yours, sir. Volt. Here they come, ha' done. Mos. I haue another witnesse, if you neede, sir, I can produce. Volt. Who is it? Mos. Sir, I haue her. Scene V. Avocatori, 4. Bonario, Celia, Voltore, Corbaccio, Corvino, Mosca, Notario, Commandadori. The like of this the Senate neuer heard of. Avoc. 2. 'Twil come most strange to them, when we report it. Avoc. 4. The gentlewoman has beene euer held Of vn-reproued name. Avoc. 3. So, the yong man. Avoc. 4. The more vnnaturall part that of his father. Avoc. 2. More of the husband. Avoc. 1. I not know to giue. His act a name, it is so monstrous! Avoc. 4. But the impostor, he is a thing created T'exceed example! Avoc. And all after times! Avoc. 2. I neuer heard a true voluptuary Describ'd, but him. Avoc. 3. Appeare yet those were cited? Nota. All, but the old magnifico, Volpone. Avoc. 1. Why is not hee here? Mos. Please your father-hoods, Here is his Aduocate. Himselfe's, so weake, So feebleâ Avoc. 4. What are you? Bon. His parasite, His knaue, his pandar: I beseech the court, He may be forc'd to come, that your graue eyes May beare strong witnesse of his strange impostures. Volt. Vpon my faith, and credit, with your vertues, He is not able to endure the ayre. Avo. 2. Bring him, how euer. Avo. 3. We will see him. Avo. 4. Fetch him. Volt. Your father-hoods fit pleasures be obey'd, But sure, the sight will rather mooue your pitties, Then indignation; may it please the court, In the meane time, he may be heard in me: I know this place most voide of preiudice, And therefore craue it, since we haue no reason To feare our truth should hurt our cause. Avoc. 3. Speake free. Volt. Then know, most honor'd fathers, I must now Discouer, to your strangely' abused eares, The most prodigious, and most frontlesse piece Of solid impudence, and trecherie, That euer vicious nature yet brought foorth To shame the state of Venice. This lewd woman (That wants no artificiall lookes, or teares, To helpe the visor, she has now put on) Hath long beene knowne a close adulteresse, To that lasciuious youth there; not suspected, I say, but knowne; and taken, in the act; With him; and by this man, the easie husband, Pardon'd: whose timelesse bounty makes him, now, Stand here, the most vnhappie, innocent person, That euer mans owne goodnesse made accus'd. For these, not knowing how to owe a gift Of that deare grace, but with their shame; being plac'd So' aboue all powers of their gratitude, Began to hate the benefit: and, in place Of thankes, deuise t'extirpe the memorie Of such an act. Wherein, I pray your father-hoods, To obserue the malice, yea, the rage of creatures Discouer'd in their euils; and what heart Such take, euen, from their crimes. But that, anone, Will more appeare. This gentleman, the father, Hearing of this foule fact, with many others, VVhich dayly strooke at his too-tender eares, And, grieu'd in nothing more, then that he could not Preserue him selfe a parent (his sonnes ills Growing to that strange floud) at last decreed To dis-inherit him. Avoc. 1. These be strange turnes! Avoc. 2. The yong mans fame was euer faire, and honest. Volt. So much more full of danger is his vice, That can beguile so, vnder shade of vertue. But as I said (my honour'd sires) his father Hauing this setled purpose, (by what meanes To him betray'd, we know not) and this day Appointed for the deed; that parricide, (I cannot stile him better) by confederacy Preparing this his paramour to be there, Entred Volpone's house (who was the man Your father-hoods must vnderstand, design'd For the inheritance) there, sought his father: But, with what purpose sought he him, my lords? (I tremble to pronounce it, that a sonne Vnto a father, and to such a father Should haue so foule, felonious intent) It was, to murder him. When, being preuented By his more happy absence, what then did he? Not check his wicked thoughts; no, now new deeds: (Mischiefe doth euer end, where it begins) An act of horror, fathers! he drag'd forth The aged gentleman, that had there lien, bed-red, Three yeeres, and more, out off his innocent couch, Naked, vpon the floore, there left him; wounded His seruant in the face; and, with this strumpet The stale to his forg'd practise, who was glad To be so actiue, (I shall here desire Your father-hoods to note but my collections, As most remarkable) thought, at once, to stop His fathers ends; discredit his free choice, In the old gentleman; redeeme themselues, By laying infamy vpon this man, To whom, with blushing, they should owe their liues. Avoc. 1. What proofes haue you of this? Bon. Most honour'd fathers, I humbly craue, there be no credit giuen To this mans mercenary tongue. Avoc. 2. Forbeare. Bon. His soule moues in his fee. Avoc. 3. O, sir. Bon. This fellow, For six sols more, would pleade against his maker. Avoc. 1. You do forget your selfe. Volt. Nay, nay, graue fathers, Let him haue scope: can any man imagine That he will spare' his accuser, that would not Haue spar'd his parent? Avo. 1. Well, produce your proofes. Cel. I would I could forget, I were a creature. Volt. Signior Corbaccio. Avo. 4. What is he? Volt. The father. Avo. 2. Has he had an oth? Not. Yes. Corb. What must I do now? Not. Your testimony's crau'd. Corb. Speake to the knaue? I'le ha' my mouth, first, stopt with earth; my heart Abhors his knowledge: I disclaime in him. Avo. 1. But, for what cause? Corb. The meere portent of nature. He is an vtter stranger, to my loines. Bon. Haue they made you to this! Corb. I will not heare thee, Monster of men, swine, goate, wolfe, parricide, Speake not, thou viper. Bon. Sir, I will sit, downe, And rather wish my innocence should suffer, Then I resist the authority of a father. Volt. Signior Corvino. Avo. 2. This is strange! Avo. 1. Who's this? Not. The husband. Avo. 4. Is he sworn? Not. He is. Avo. 3. Speak then. Corv. This woman (please your father-hoods) is a whore, Of most hot exercise, more then a partrich, Vpon recordâ Avo. 1. No more. Corv. Neighes, like a iennet. Not. Preserue the honour of the court. Corv. I shall, And modestie of your most reuerend eares. And, yet, I hope that I may say, these eyes Haue seene her glew'd vnto that peece of cedar; That fine well-timber'd gallant: and that, here, The letters may be read, thorough the horne, That make the story perfect. Mos. Excellent! sir. Corv. There is no shame in this, now, is there? Mos. None. Corv. Or if I said, I hop'd that she were onward To her damnation, if there be a hell Greater then whore, and woman; a good catholique May make the doubt. Avo. 3. His griefe hath made him frantique. Avo. 1. Remoue him, hence. Avo. 2. Looke to the woman. Corv. Rare! She swownes. Prettily fain'd! againe! Avo. 4. Stand from about her. Avo. 1. Giue her the ayre. Avo. 3. What can you say? Mos. My wound (May't please your wisdomes) speakes for me, receiu'd In ayde of my good patron, when he mist His sought-for father, when that well-taught dame Had her cue giuen her, to cry out a rape. Bon. O, most lay'd impudence! Fathersâ Avo. 3. Sir, be silent, You had your hearing free, so must they theirs. Avo. 2. I do begin to doubt th'imposture here. Avo. 4. This woman, has too many moodes. Volt. Graue fathers, She is a creature, of a most profest, And prostituted lewdnesse. Corv. Most impetuous! Vnsatisfied, graue fathers! Volt. May her fainings Not take your wisdomes: but, this day, she baited A stranger, a graue knight, with her loose eyes, And more lasciuious kisses. This man saw 'hem Together, on the water, in a gondola. Mos. Here is the lady her selfe, that saw 'hem too, Without; who, then, had in the open streets Pursu'd them, but for sauing her knights honour. Avo. 1. Produce that lady. Avo. 2. Let her come. Avo. 4. These things, They strike, with wonder! Avo. 3. I am turn'd a stone! Scene VI. Mosca, Lady, Avocatori, &amp;c. Bee resolute, madame. Lad. I, this same is shee. Out, thou chameleon harlot; now, thine eies Vie teares with the hyÃ¦na: dar'st thou looke Vpon my wronged face? I cry your pardons. I feare, I haue (forgettingly) transgrest Against the dignitie of the courtâ Avo. 2. No, madame. Lad. And beene exorbitantâ Avo. 4. You haue not, lady. Avo. 4. These proofes are strong. Lad. Surely, I had no purpose: To scandalize your honours, or my sexes. Avo. 3. VVe do beleeue it. Lad. Surely, you may beleeue it. Avo. 2. Madame, we do. Lad. Indeede, you may; my breeding Is not so courseâ Avo. 4. VVe know it. Lad. To offend VVith pertinacyâ Avo. 3. Lady. Lad. Such a presence: No, surely. Avo. 1. VVe well thinke it. Lad. You may thinke it. Avo. 1. Let her o'recome. VVhat witnesses haue you, To make good your report? Bon. Our consciences. Cel. And heauen, that neuer failes the innocent. Avo. 4. These are no testimonies. Bon. Not in your courts, VVhere multitude, and clamour ouercomes. Avo. 1. Nay, then you do waxe insolent. Volt. Here, here, Volpone is brought in, as impotent. The testimonie comes, that will conuince, And put to vtter dumbnesse their bold tongues. See here, graue fathers, here's the rauisher, The rider on mens wiues, the great impostor, The grand voluptuary! do you not think, These limbes should affect venery? or these eyes Couet a concubine? 'pray you, marke these hands. Are they not fit to stroake a ladies brests? Perhaps, he doth dissemble? Bon. So he do's. Volt. Would you ha' him tortur'd? Bon. I would haue him prou'd. Volt. Best try him, then, with goades, or burning Irons; Put him to the strappado: I haue heard, The racke hath cur'd the gout, faith, giue it him, And helpe him of a maladie, be courteous. I'le vndertake, before these honour'd fathers, He shall haue, yet, as many left diseases, As she has knowne adulterers, or thou strumpets. O, my most equall hearers, if these deedes, Acts, of this bold, and most exorbitant straine, May passe with sufferance, what one citizen, But owes the forfeit of his life, yea fame, To him that dares traduce him? which of you Are safe, my honour'd fathers? I would aske (With leaue of your graue father-hoods) if their plot Haue any face, or colour like to truth? Or if, vnto the dullest nostrill, here, It smell not rancke, and most abhorred slander? I craue your care of this good gentleman, Whose life is much indanger'd, by their fable; And, as for them, I will conclude with this, That vicious persons when they are hot, and flesh'd In impious acts, their constancy abounds: Damn'd deeds are done with greatest confidence. Avoc. 1. Take 'hem to custody, and seuer them. Avoc. 2. 'Tis pittie, two such prodigies should liue. Avoc. 1. Let the old gentleman be return'd, with care: I'am sorry, our credulitie wrong'd him. Avo. 4. These are two creatures! Avo. 3. I haue an earthquake in me! Avo. 2. Their shame (euen in their cradles) fled their faces. Avo. 4. You' haue done a worthy seruice to the state, sir, In their discouerie. Avo. 1. You shall heare, ere night, What punishment the court decrees vpon 'hem. Volt. We thanke your fatherhoods. How like you it? Mos. Rare. I'ld ha' your tongue, sir, tipt with gold, for this; I'ld ha' you be the heire to the whole citie; The earth I'ld haue want men, ere you want liuing: They' are bound to erect your statue, in St. Markes. Signior Corvino, I would haue you goe, And shew your selfe, that you haue conquer'd. Corv. Yes. Mos. It was much better, that you should professe Your selfe a cuckold, thus, then that the other Should haue beene prou'd. Corv. Nay, I consider'd that: Now, it is her fault. Mos. Then, it had beene yours. Corv. True, I doe doubt this Aduocate, still. Mos. I'faith, You need not, I dare ease you of that care. Corv. I trust thee, Mosca. Mos. As your owne soule, sir. Corb. Mosca. Mos. Now for your businesse, sir. Corb. How? ha' you busines? Mos. Yes, yours, sir. Corb. O, none else? Mos. None else, not I. Corb. Be carefull then. Mos. Rest you, with both your eyes, sir. Corb. Dispatch it. Mos. Instantly. Corb. And looke, that all, What-euer, be put in, iewels, plate, moneyes, Household-stuffe, bedding, cortines. Mos. Cortine-rings, sir, Onely, the Aduocates fee must be deducted. Corb. I'le pay him, now: you'll be too prodigall. Mos. Sir, I must tender it. Corb. Two cecchines is well? Mos. No, six, sir. Corb. 'Tis too much. Mos. He talk'd a great while, You must consider that, sir. Corb. Well, there's threeâ Mos. I'le giue it him. Corb. Doe so, and there's for thee. Mos. Bountifull bones! What horride strange offence Did he commit 'gainst nature, in his youth, Worthy this age? you see, sir, how I worke Vnto your ends; take you no notice. Volt. No, I'le leaue you. Mos. All, is yours; the deuill, and all: Good Aduocate. Madame, I'le bring you home. Lad. No, I'le goe see your patron. Mos. That you shall not: I'le tell you, why. My purpose is, to vrge My patron to reforme his will; and, for The zeale you' haue shew'n to day, whereas before You were but third, or, fourth, you shall be now Put in the first: which would appeare as beg'd, If you were present. Thereforeâ Lad. You shall sway me.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. Scene I. Volpone. Well, I am here; and all this brunt is past: I ne're was in dislike with my disguise, Till this fled moment; here, 'twas good, in priuate, But, in your publike, Caue, whil'st I breathe. 'Fore god, my left legge 'gan to haue the crampe; And I apprehended, straight, some power had strooke me With a dead palsey: well, I must be merry, And shake it off. A many of these feares Would put me into some villanous disease, Should they come thick vpon me: I'le preuent 'hem. Giue me a boule of lustie wine, to fright This humor from my heart; (hum, hum, hum) He drinkes. 'Tis almost gone, already: I shall conquer. Any deuice, now, of rare, ingenious knauery, That would possesse me with a violent laughter, Would make me vp, againe! So, so, so, so. Drinkes againe. This heate is life; 'tis bloud, by this time: Mosca! Scene II. Mosca , Volpone, Nano, Castrone. How now, sir? do's the day looke cleare againe? Are we recouer'd? and wrought out of error, Into our way? to see our path, before vs? Is our trade free, once more? Volp. Exquisite Mosca! Mos. Was it not carry'd learnedly? Volp. And stoutly. Good wits are greatest in extremities. Mos. It were a folly, beyond thought, to trust Any grand act vnto a cowardly spirit: You are not taken with it, enough, me thinkes? Volp. O, more, then if I had enioy'd the wench: The pleasure of all woman-kind's not like it. Mos. Why, now you speake, sir. We must, here be fixt; Here, we must rest; this is our master-peece: We cannot thinke, to goe beyond this. Volp. True, Thou 'hast playd thy prise, my precious Mosca. Mos. Nay, sir, To gull the courtâ Volp. And, quite diuert the torrent; Vpon the innocent. Mos. Yes, and to make So rare a musique out of discordesâ Volp. Right. That, yet, to me's the strangest! how th'hast borne it! That these (being so diuided 'mongst themselues) Should not sent some-what, or in me, or thee, Or doubt their owne side. Mos. True, they will not see't. Too much light blinds 'hem, I thinke. Each of 'hem Is so possest, and stuft with his owne hopes, That any thing, vnto the contrary, Neuer so true, or neuer so apparent, Neuer so palpable, they will resist itâ Volp. Like a temptation of the diuell. Mos. Right, sir. Merchants may talke of trade, and your great signiors Of land, that yeelds well; but if Italy Haue any glebe, more fruitfull, then these fellowes, I am deceiu'd. Did not your Aduocate rare? Volp. O (my most honor'd fathers, my graue fathers, Vnder correction of your father-hoods, What face of truth is, here? If these strange deeds May passe, most honour'd fathersâ) I had much a doe To forbeare laughing. Mos. 'T seem'd to mee, you sweat, sir. Volp. In troth, I did a little. Mos. But confesse, sir, Were you not daunted? Volp. In good faith, I was A little in a mist; but not deiected: Neuer, but still my selfe. Mos. I thinke it, sir. Now (so truth helpe me) I must needes say this, sir. And, out of conscience, for your aduocate: He' has taken paines, in faith, sir, and deseru'd, (In my poore iudgement, I speake it, vnder fauour, Not to contrary you, sir) very richlyâ Wellâto be cosen'd. Volp. 'Troth, and I thinke so too, By that I heard him, in the latter end. Mos. O, but before, sir; had you heard him, first, Draw it to certaine heads, then aggrauate, Then vse his vehement figuresâI look'd still, When he would shift a shirt; and, doing this Out of pure loue, no hope of gaineâ Volp. 'Tis right. I cannot answer him, Mosca, as I would, Not yet; but for thy sake, at thy intreaty, I will beginne, eu'n now, to vexe 'hem all: This very instant. Mos. Good, sir. Volp. Call the dwarfe, And eunuch, forth. Mos. Castrone, Nano. Nan. Here. Volp. Shal we haue a jig, now? Mos. What you please, sir. Volp. Go, Streight giue out, about the streetes, you two, That I am dead; doe it with constancy, Sadly, doe you heare? impute it to the griefe Of this late slander. Mos. What doe you meane, sir? Volp. O, I shall haue, instantly, my vulture, crow, Rauen, come flying hither (on the newes) To peck for carrion, my shee-wolfe, and all, Greedy, and full of expectationâ Mos. And then to haue it rauish'd from their mouthes? Volp. 'Tis true, I will ha' thee put on a gowne, And take vpon thee, as thou wert mine heire; Shew 'hem a will: open that chest, and reach Forth one of those, that has the blankes. I'le straight Put in thy name. Mos. It will be rare, sir. Volp. I, When they e'ene gape, and finde themselues deludedâ Mos. Yes. Volp. And thou vse them skiruily. Dispatch, Get on thy gowne. Mos. But, what, sir, if they aske After the body? Volp. Say, it was corrupted. Mos I'le say, it stunke, sir; and was faine t'haue it Coffin'd vp instantly, and sent away. Volp. Any thing, what thou wilt. Hold, here's my will. Get thee a cap, a count-booke, pen and inke, Papers afore thee; sit, as thou wert taking An inuentory of parcels: I'le get vp, Behind the cortine, on a stoole, and harken; Sometime, peepe ouer; see, how they doe looke; With what degrees, their bloud doth leaue their faces! O, 'twill afford me a rare meale of laughter. Mos. Your Aduocate will turne stark dull, vpon it. Volp. It will take off his oratories edge. Mos. But your Clarissimo, old round-backe, he Will crumpe you, like a hog-louse, with the touch. Volp. And what Corvino? Mos. O, sir, looke for him, To morrow morning, with a rope, and a dagger, To visite all the streetes; he must runne mad. My Lady too, that came into the court, To beare false witnesse, for your worshipâ Volp. Yes, And kist mee 'fore the fathers; when my face Flow'd all with oyles. Mos. And sweate, sir. Why, your gold Is such another med'cine, it dries vp All those offensiue sauors! It transformes The most deformed, and restores 'hem louely, As 't were the strange poeticall girdle. Iove Cestus. Could not inuent, t'himselfe, a shroud more subtile, To passe Acrisivs guardes. It is the thing Makes all the world her grace, her youth, her beauty. Volp. I thinke, she loues me. Mos. Who? the lady, sir? Shee's iealous of you. Volp. Do'st thou say so? Mos. Harke, There's some already. Volp. Looke. Mos. It is the vulture: He has the quickest sent. Volp. I'le to my place, Thou, to thy posture. Mos. I am set. Volp. But, Mosca, Play the artificer now, torture 'hem, rarely. Scene. III. Voltore , Mosca, Corbaccio, Corvino, Lady, Volpone. How now, my Mosca? Mos. Turkie carpets, nineâ Volt. Taking an inuentory? that is well. Mos. Two sutes of bedding, tissewâ Volt. Where's the will? Let me read that, the while. Corb. So, set me downe: And get you home. Volt. Is he come, now, to trouble vs? Mos. Of cloth of gold, two moreâ Corb. Is it done, Mosca? Mos. Of seuerall vellets, eightâ Volt. I like his care. Corb. Dost thou not heare? Corv. Ha? is the houre come, Mosca? Volpone peepes from behinde a trauerse. Volp. I, now, they muster. Corv. What do's the aduocate here? Or this Corbaccio? Corb. What do these here? Lad. Mosca? Is his thred spunne? Mos. Eight chests of linnenâ Volp. O, My fine dame Wovld-bee, too! Corv. Mosca, the will, That I may shew it these, and rid 'hem hence. Mos. Six chests of diaper, foure of damaskeâThere. Corb. Is that the will? Mos. Down-beds, and boulstersâ Volp. (Rare! Be busie still. Now, they begin to flutter: They neuer thinke of me. Looke, see, see, see! How their swift eies runne ouer the long deed, Vnto the name, and to the legacies, What is bequeath'd them, thereâ Mos. Ten sutes of hangingsâ Volp. I, i'their garters, Mosca. Now, their hopes Are at the gaspe. Volt. Mosca the heire! Corb. What's that? Volp. My aduocate is dumbe, looke to my merchant, Hee has heard of some strange storme, a ship is lost, He faints: my lady will swoune. Old glazen-eyes, He hath not reach'd his dispaire, yet. Corb. All these Are out of hope, I'am sure the man. Corv. But, Moscaâ Mos. Two cabenetsâ Corv. Is this in earnest? Mos. One Of ebony.â Corv. Or, do you but delude me? Mos. The other, mother of pearleâI am very busie. Good faith, it is a fortune throwne vpon meâ Item, one salt of agatânot my seeking. Lad. Do you heare, sir? Mos. A perfum'd boxeâ'pray you forbeare, You see I am troubledâmade of an onyxâ Lad. How! Mos. To morrow, or next day, I shall be at leasure, To talke with you all. Corv. Is this my large hopes issue? Lad. Sir, I must haue a fayrer answer. Mos. Madame! Mary, and shall: 'pray you, fairely quit my house. Nay, raise no tempest with your lookes; but, harke you: Remember, what your ladiship offred me, To put you in, an heire; goe to, thinke on't. And what you said, eene your best madames did For maintenance, and, why not you? inough. Goe home, and vse the poore sir Pol, your knight, well; For feare I tell some riddles: go, be melancholique. Volp. O, my fine diuell! Corv. Mosca, 'pray you a word. Mos. Lord! will not you take your dispatch hence, yet? Me thinkes (of all) you should haue beene th'example. VVhy should you stay, here? with what thought? what promise? Heare you, doe not you know, I know you an asse? And, that you would, most faine, haue beene a wittoll, If fortune would haue let you? that you are A declar'd cuckold, on good termes? this pearle, You'll say, was yours? right: this diamant? I'le not deny't, but thanke you. Much here, else? It may be so. VVhy, thinke that these good works May helpe to hide you bad: I'le not betray you, Although you be but extraordinary, And haue it onely in title, it sufficeth. Go home, be melancholique too, or mad. Volp. Rare, Mosca! how his villany becomes him! Volt. Certaine, he doth delude all these, for me. Corb. Mosca, the heire? Volp. O, his foure eyes haue found it! Corb. I'am cosen'd, cheated, by a parasite-slaue; Harlot, t'hast gul'd me. Mos. Yes, sir. Stop your mouth, Or I shall draw the onely tooth, is left. Are not you he, that filthy couetous wretch, With the three legges, that here, in hope of prey, Haue, any time this three yeere, snuft about, With your most grou'ling nose; and would haue hir'd Me to the pois'ning of my patron? sir? Are not you he, that haue, to day, in court, Profess'd the dis-inheriting of your sonne? Periur'd your selfe? Go home, and die, and stinke; If you but croake a sillable, all comes out: Away and call your porters, go, go, stinke. Volp. Excellent varlet! Volt. Now, my faithfull Mosca, I finde thy constancie. Mos. Sir? Volt. Sincere. Mos. A table Of porphiryâI mar'le, you'll be thus troublesome. Volt. Nay, leaue off now, they are gone. Mos. Why? who are you? VVhat? who did send for you? O' cry you mercy, Reuerend sir! good faith, I am greeu'd for you, That any chance of mine should thus defeate Your (I must needs say) most deseruing trauels: But, I protest, sir it was cast vpon me, And I could, almost, wish to be without it, But, that the will o'th' dead, must be obseru'd. Mary, my ioy is, that you need it not, You haue a gift, sir, (thanke your education) VVill neuer let you want, while there are men, And malice, to breed causes. VVould I had But halfe the like, for all my fortune, sir.

In meane time, You, that haue so much law, I know ha' the conscience, Not to be couetous of what is mine. Good sir, I thanke you for my plate: 'twill helpe To set vp a yong man.

They say, the court is set. Corv. We must maintaine Our first tale good, for both our reputations. Corb. Why? mine's no tale: my sonne would, there, haue kild me. Corv.

Volt. Come, sir, leaue your prating. Volp. Why, if your worship giue me but your hand, That I may ha' the refusall; I haue done. 'Tis a meere toy, to you, sir; candle rents: As your learn'd worship knowesâ Volt. What doe I know? Volp. Mary no end of your wealth, sir, god decrease it. Volt. Mistaking knaue! what, mock'st thou my mis-fortune? Volp. His blessing on your heart, sir, would 'twere more. (Now, to my first, againe; at the next corner.) Scene VIII. Corbaccio , Corvino, (Mosca, passant) Volpone. See, in our habite! see the impudent varlet! Corv. That I could shoote mine eies at him, like gun-stones. Volp. But, is this true, sir, of the parasite? Corb. Againe, t'afflict vs? monster! Volp. In good faith, sir, I'am hartily greeu'd, a beard of your graue length Should be so ouer-reach'd. I neuer brook'd That parasites haire, me thought his nose should cosen: There still was somewhat, in his looke, did promise The bane of a Clarissimo. Corb. Knaueâ Volp. Me thinkes, Yet you, that are so traded i' the world, A witty merchant, the fine bird, Corvino, That haue such morall emblemes on your name, Should not haue sung you shame; and dropt your cheese: To let the Foxe laugh at your emptinesse. Corv. Sirrah, you thinke, the priuiledge of the place, And your red saucy cap, that seemes (to me) Nayl'd to your iolt-head, with those two cecchines, Can warrant your abuses; come you, hither: You shall perceiue, sir, I dare beate you. Approch. Volp. No haste, sir, I doe know your valure, well: Since you durst publish what you are, sir. Corv. Tarry, I'ld speake, with you. Volp. Sir, sir, another timeâ Corv. Nay, now. Volp. O god, sir! I were a wise man, Would stand the fury of a distracted cuckold. Corb. What! come againe? Volp. Vpon 'hem, Mosca; saue me, Mosca walkes by 'hem. Corb. The ayre's infected, where he breathes. Corv. Lets flye him. Volp. Excellent Basiliske! turne vpon the vulture. Scene IX. Voltore , Mosca, Volpone. VVell, flesh-flie, it is sommer with you, now; Your winter will come on. Mos. Good Aduocate, 'Pray thee, not raile, nor threaten out of place, thus; Thou'lt make a solÅcisme (as madame sayes.) Get you a biggen, more: your braine breakes loose. Volt. Well, sir. Volp. Would you ha' me beate the insolent slaue? Throw dirt, vpon his first good cloathes? Volt, This same Is, doubtlesse, some familiar! Volp. Sir, the court In troth, stayes for you. I am mad, a mule, That neuer read Ivstinian, should get vp, And ride an Aduocate. Had you no quirke, To auoide gullage, sir, by such a creature? I hope you doe but iest; he has not done 't: This's but confederacy, to blind the rest. You are the heire? Volt. A strange, officious, Trouble-some knaue! thou dost torment me. Volp. I knowâ It cannot be, sir, that you should be cosen'd; 'Tis not within the wit of man, to doe it: You are so wise, so prudent, and, 'tis fit, That wealth, and wisdome still, should goe together. Scene 10. Avocatori, 4. Notario, Commandadore, Bonario, Celia, Corbaccio, Corvino, Voltore, Volpone. Are all the parties, here? Not. All, but the Aduocate. Avo. 2. And, here he comes. Avo. Then bring 'hem foorth to sentence. Volt. O, my most honour'd fathers, let your mercy Once winne vpon your iustice, to forgiueâ I am distractedâ Volp. (What will he doe, now?) Volp. O, I know not which t'addresse my selfe to, first, Whether your father-hoods, or these innocentsâ Corv. (Will he betray himselfe?) Volt. Whom, equally, I haue abus'd, out of most couetous endesâ Corv. (The man is mad! Corb. What's that? Corv. He is possest.) Volt. For which; now strooke in conscience, here I prostrate My selfe, at your offended feet, for pardon. Avo. 1. 2. Arise. Cel. O heau'n, how iust thou art! Volp. I'am caught I'mine owne nooseâ Corv. Be constant, sir, nought now Can helpe, but impudence. Avo. 1. Speake forward. Com. Silence. Volt. It is not passion in me, reuerend fathers, But onely conscience, conscience my good sires, That makes me, now, tell truth. That parasite, That knaue hath been the instrument of all. Avo. Where is that knaue? fetch him. Volp. I goe. Corv. Graue fathers, This man's distracted; he confest it, now: For, hoping to be old Volpone's heire, Who now is deadâ Avoc. 3. How? Avo. 2. Is Volpone dead? Corv. Dead since, graue fathersâ Bon. O, sure vengeance! Avo. 1. Stay, Then, he was no deceiuer? Volt. O no, none: The parasite, graue fathers. Corv. He do's speake, Out of meere enuie, 'cause the seruant's made The thing, he gap't for; please your father-hoods, This is the truth: though, I'le not iustifie The other, but he may be some-deale faulty. Volt. I, to your hopes, as well as mine, Corvino: But I'le vse modesty. Pleaseth your wisdomes To viewe these certaine notes, and but conferre them; As I hope fauour, they shall speake cleare truth. Corv. The deuill ha's entred him! Bon. Or bides in you. Avo. 4. We haue done ill, by a publike officer, To send for him, if he be heire. Avo. 2. For whom? Avo. 4. Him, that they call the parasite. Avo. 3. 'Tis true; He is a man, of great estate, now left. Avo. 4. Goe you, and learne his name; and say, the court Intreates his presence, here; but, to the clearing Of some few doubts. Avo. 2. This same's a labyrinth! Avo. 1. Stand you vnto your first report? Corv. My state, My life, my fameâ Bon. (Where is't?) Corv. Are at the stake. Avo. 1. Is yours so too? Corb. The Aduocate's a knaue: And has a forked tongueâ Avo. 2. (Speake to the point.) Corb. So is the parasite, too. Avo. 1. This is confusion. Volt. I doe beseech your father-hoods, read but those; Corv. And credit nothing, the false spirit hath writ: It cannot be, but he is possest, graue fathers. Scene XI. Volpone , Nano, Androgino, Castrone. To make a snare, for mine owne necke! and run My head into it, wilfully! with laughter! When I had newly scap't, was free, and cleare! Out of mere wantonnesse! Ã´, the dull deuill Was in this braine of mine, when I deuis'd it; And Mosca gaue it second: he must now Helpe to seare vp this veyne, or we bleed dead. How now! who let you loose? whither goe you, now? What? to buy ginger-bread? or to drowne kitlings? Nan. Sir, master Mosca call'd vs out of doores, And bid vs all goe play, and tooke the keies. And. Yes. Volp. Did master Mosca take the keyes? why, so! I am farder, in. These are my fine conceipts! I must be merry, with a mischiefe to me! What a vile wretch was I, that could not beare My fortune soberly? I must ha' my crotchets! And my conundrums! well, goe you, and seeke him: His meaning may be truer, then my feare. Bid him, he streight come to me, to the court; Thither will I, and, if't be possible, Vn-screw my aduocate, vpon new hopes: When I prouok'd him, then I lost my selfe. Scene XII. Avocatori, &amp;c. These things can nere be reconcil'd. He, here, Professeth, that the gentleman was wrong'd; And that the gentlewoman was brought thither, Forc'd by her husband: and there left. Volt. Most true. Cel. How ready is heau'n to those, that pray! Avo. 1. But, that Volpone would haue rauish'd her, he holds Vtterly false; knowing his impotence. Corv. Graue fathers, he is possest; againe, I say, Possest: nay, if there be possession, And obsession, he has both. Avo. 3. Here comes our officer. Volp. The parasite will streight be, here, graue fathers. Avo. 4. You might inuent some other name, sir varlet. Avo. 3. Did not the notarie meet him? Volp. Not that I know. Avo. 4. His comming will cleare all. Avo. 2. Yet it is mistie. Volpone whispers the Aduocate. Volt. May't please your father-hoodsâ Volp. Sir, the parasite Will'd me to tell you, that his master liues; That you are still the man; your hopes the same; And this was, onely a iestâ Volt. How? Volp. Sir, to trie If you were, firme, and how you stood affected. Volt. Art' sure he liues? Volp. Doe I liue, sir? Volt. O me! I was to violent. Volp. Sir, you may redeeme it, They said, you were possest; fall downe, and seeme so: Voltore falls. I'le helpe to make it good. God blesse the man! (Stop your wind hard, and swell) see, see, see, see! He vomits crooked pinnes! his eyes are set, Like a dead hares, hung in a poulters shop! His mouth's running away! doe you see, signior? Now, 'tis in his belly. Corv. (I, the deuill!) Volp. Now, in his throate. Corv. (I, I perceiue it plaine.) Volp. 'Twill out, t'will out; stand cleere. See, where it flies! In shape of a blew toad, with a battes wings! Doe not you see it, sir? Corb. What? I thinke I doe. Corv. 'Tis too manifest. Volp. Looke! he comes t'himselfe! Volt. Where am I? Volp. Take good heart, the worst is past, sir. You are dis-possest. Ato. 1 What accident is this? Avo. Sodaine, and full of wonder! Ato. 3. If he were. Possest, as it appeares, all this is nothing. Corv. He has beene, often, subbiect to these fits, Avo. 1. Shew him that writing, do you know it, sir? Volp. Deny it, sir, forsweare it, know it not. Volt. Yes, I doe know it well, it is my hand: But all, that it containes, is false. Bon. 3. O practise! Avo. 2. What maze is this! Avo. 1. Is he not guilty, then, Whom you, there, name the parasite? Volt. Graue fathers, No more then, his good patron, old Volpone. Avo. 4. Why, he is dead? Volt. O no, my honor'd fathers. He liuesâ Avo. 1. How! liues? Volt. Liues. Avo. 2. This is subtler, yet! Avo. 3. You said, he was dead? Volt. Neuer. Avo. 3. You said so? Corv. I heard so. Avo. 4. Here comes the gentleman make him way. Avo. 3. A stoole. Avoc. 4. A proper man! and were Volpone dead, A fit match for my daughter. Avoc. 3. Giue him way. Volp. Mosca, I was a'most lost, the Aduocate Had betray'd all; but, now, it is recouer'd: Al's o' the hinge againeâsay, I am liuing. Mos. What busie knaue is this! most reuerend fathers, I sooner, had attended your graue pleasures, But that my order, for the funerall Of my deare patron did require meâ Volp. (Mosca!) Mos. Whom I intend to bury, like a gentleman. Volp. I, quicke, and cosen me of all. Avo. 2. Still stranger! More intricate! Avo. 1. And come about againe! Avo. 4. It is a match, my daughter is bestow'd. Mos. (Wil you gi'me halfe? Volp. First, I'le be hang'd. Mos. I know, Your voice is good, cry not so lowd') Avo. 1. Demand The Aduocate. Sir, did not you affirme, Volpone was aliue? Volp. Yes, and he is; This gent'man told me so, (thou shalt haue halfe.) Mos. Whose drunkard is this same? speake some, that know him: I neuer saw his face. (I cannot now Affoord it you so cheape. Volp. No?) Avo 1. What say you? Volt. The officer told mee. Volp. I did, graue fathers, And will maintaine, he liues, with mine owne life. And, that this creature told me. (I was borne, With all good starres my enemies.) Mos. Most graue fathers, If such an insolence, as this, must passe Vpon me, I am silent: 'twas not this, For which you sent, I hope. Avo. 2. Take him away. Volp. (Mosca.) Avo. 3. Let him be whipt. Volp. (Wilt thou betray me? Cosen me?) Aoc. 3. And taught to beare himselfe Toward a person of his ranke. Avo. 4. Away. Mos. I humbly thank your father-hoods. Volp. Soft, soft: whipt? And loose all that I haue? if I confesse, It cannot be much more. Avo. 4. Sir, are you married? Volp. They'll be ally'd, anon; I must be resolute: He puts off his disguise. The Foxe shall, here, vncase. Mos. (Patron.) Volp. Nay, now, My ruines shall not come alone; your match I'le hinder sure: my substance shall not glew you, Nor screw you, into a family. Mos. (Why, patron!) Volp. I am Volpone, and this is my knaue; This, his owne knaue; this, auarices foole; This, a ChimÃ¦ra of wittall, foole, and knaue; And, reuerend fathers, since we all can hope Nought, but a sentence, let's not now despaire it. You heare me briefe. Corv. May it please your father-hoodsâ Com. silence. Avoc. 1. The knot is now vndone, by miracle! Avoc. 2. Nothing can be more cleare. Avo. 3. Or can more proue These innocent. Avoc. 1. Giue 'hem their liberty. Bon. Heauen could not, long, let such grosse crimes be hid. Avoc. 2. If this be held the high way to get riches, May I be poore. Avoc. 3. This 's not the gaine, but torment. Avoc. 1. These possesse wealth, as sicke men possesse feuers, Which, trulyer may be said to possesse them. Avoc. 2. Disroabe that parasite. Corv.; Mos. Most honor'd fathers. Avoc. 1. Can you plead ought to stay the course of iustice? If you can, speake. Corv.; Volt. We beg fauor, Cel. And mercy. Avoc. 1. You hurt your innocence, suing for the guilty. Stand forth; and, first, the parasite. You appeare T'haue beene the chiefest minister, if not plotter, In all these lewd impostures; and now, lastly, Haue, with your impudence, abus'd the court, And habit of a gentleman of Venice, Being a fellow of no birth, or bloud: For which, our sentence is, first thou be whipt; Then liue perpetuall prisoner in our gallies. Volt. I thanke you, for him. Mos. Bane to thy wooluish nature. Avoc. 1. Deliuer him to the Saffi. Thou, Volpone, By bloud, and ranke a gentleman, canst not fall Vnder like censure; but our iudgement on thee Is, that thy substance all be straight confiscate To the hospitall, of the Incurabili: And, since the most was gotten by imposture, By faining lame, gout, palsey, and such diseases, Thou art to lie in prison, crampt with irons, Till thou bee'st sicke, and lame indeed. Remoue him. Volp. This is call'd mortifying of a Foxe. Avoc. 1. Thou Voltore, to take away the scandale Thou hast giu'n all worthy men, of thy profession, Art banish'd from their fellowship, and our state. Corbaccio, bring him neere. We here possesse Thy sonne, of all thy state; and confine thee To the monasterie of San' Spirito: Where, since thou knew'st not how to liue well here, Thou shalt be learn'd to die well. Corb. Ha! what said he? Com. You shall know anone, sir. Avoc. Thou Corvino, shalt Be straight imbarqu'd from thine owne house, and row'd Round about Venice, through the grand canale, Wearing a cap, with faire, long asses eares, In stead of hornes: and, so to mount (a paper Pin'd on thy brest) to the berlinoâ Corv. Yes, And, haue mine eies beat out with stinking fish, Bruis'd fruit, and rotten eggesâ'Tis well. I'am glad, I shall not see my shame, yet. Avoc. 1. And to expiate Thy wrongs done to thy wife, thou art to send her Home, to her father, with her dowrie trebled: And these are all your iudgements. All. (Honour'd fathers.) Avoc. 1. Which may not be reuok'd. Now, you begin, When crimes are done, and past, and to be punish'd, To thinke what your crimes are: away with them. Let all, that see these vices thus rewarded, Take heart, and loue to study 'hem. Mischiefes feed Like beasts, till they be fat, and then they bleed. Volpone. The seasoning of a play is the applause. Now, though the Foxe be punish'd by the lawes, He, yet, doth hope there is no suffring due, For any fact, which he hath done 'gainst you; If there be, sensure him: here he, doubtfull, stands. If not, fare iouially, and clap your hands. THE END.</field>
