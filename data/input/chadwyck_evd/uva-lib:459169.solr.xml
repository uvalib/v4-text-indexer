      <field name="fulltext">To the right Honourable, right Reuerend, right Worshipfull, or whatsoever he be or shall bee whom I hereafter may call Patron. If thou do'st deale with the crackt Chambermaid, Or in stale Kinswomen of thine own do'st trade, With which additions thou do'st set to sale Thy Gelded Parsonages, or do'st prevaile With thy despayring Chaplaine to divide That which should be entire, for which beside Perhaps hee payes thee too, know that from thee (Beest thou Squire, Knight, or Lord, or a degree Aboue all these) nor I, nor yet my booke Does craue protection, or a gentle Looke: But if there be a man, (such men bee rare!) That 'midst so many sacrilegious, dare Be good and honest, though he be alone, With such a zeale, such a devotion, As th'old Athenians were wont to pay Vnto their vnknowne God, I here doe lay My selfe and booke before him, and confesse That such a Vertue can deserue no lesse. Reade it (faire Sir) and when thou shalt behold The Vlcers of the time by my too bold Hand brought to light, and lanch'd, and then shalt see Vice to his face branded and told that's hee, Incircled safe in thine owne goodnesse sit, Vntouch'd by any line, and laugh at it. 'Twas made to please, and had the vicious Age Beene good enough, it had not left the Stage Without it's due Applause: But since the times Now bring forth men enamour'd on their crimes, And those the greater number, 'twere disease To thinke that any thing that bites should please. Had it beene borne a toothlesse thing, though meane, It might haue past, nay might haue praysed beene: But being a Satyreâno. Such straines of Witt Are lik'd the worse, the better they are writ. Who euer knew one deepe in loue, commend A Song though ne're so good, so aptly pend, Set to the choycest note Musick affords, Sung by as choyce a Voice, if that the words Contained nothing else but a disgrace Vnto his Mistris and her borrowed face? O happy Age! Ã´ wee are fallen now Vpon braue times, when my Lords wrinckled brow (Who perhaps labour'd in some crabbed Looke How to get farther into'th silk-mans booke, Not minding what was done, or said) must stand A Coppy, and his Anticke front command The censure of the rest, to smile or frowne, Iust as his squeesed face cryes vp or downe: When such as can judge right, and know the Lawes Of ComÃ¦dy, dare not approue, because My Ladies Woman did forget to bring Her Sp? and therefore swor't a tedious thing. But (knowing Sir) rancke not your selfe with these That judge not as things are, but as they please. Peter Hausted.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Authour. Would'st thou haue ta'ne my counsell (dearest friend) Some humble Dedication thou hadst penn'd To foule Detraction, swearing thou doest owe Thy worke to her; because that shee doth show By strength of Argument thy Labours bee Most white, and from all base aspersions free. For Envy's Vertues parasite, and feeds Vpon her trencher, then this worke must needs Bee good, which doth at its sole charge maintaine Envie so well that shee doth burst againe, And split her strutting gorge, she goes before Laughter in fatnesse, and commends thee more.</field>

The Court once set, straightwayes a Iurie went Vpon thy ComÅdie, was fully bent To finde it guiltie, though the King did sit As Iudge himselfe that day, and cleared it. If so, then let the foule-mouth'd World condemne Thy Innocent Piece, shew that thou canst contemne And slight the false Inditements which they bring To cast it, since tis quitted by the King, And all the Comicke Lawes; which not transgrest, Why should'st thou be condemn'd, lesse to be prest? That th'benefit o'th Booke, which wont to saue From suffering, thou suffering thus may'st haue. I. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Introduction. Being a Dialogue betwixt Venus, Thetis, and PhÅbus, sung by two Trebles, and a Base. Venus (being Phosphorus as well as Vesper) appearing at a window aboue as risen, calling to Sol, who lay in Thetis lap at the East side of the stage, canoped with an azure curtaine: at the first word that Venus sung, the curtaine was drawne, and they discovered. Venus. Drowsie PhÅbus come away, And let out the long'd for day, Leaue thy Thetis silver breast, And ope the casements of the East. Tis Venus calls, away, away, The waking mortals long for day. Thetis. And let them long, tis just and right To shut them in eternall night, Whose deeds deserue no day; lye still, Arise not yet, lye still my Sun, My night begins when thou art gone. Venus. Ile wooe thee with a kisse to come away. Thet. And I with fourtie for to stay. Venus. I'le giue to thee the faire Adonis sheare So thou wilt rise: Thet. And I to keepe thee here Will giue a wreath of pearle as faire As ever Sea-Nymph yet did weare. Tis Thetis wooes thee stay, O stay, O stay. Venus. Tis Venus wooes thee rise, O come away. PhÅbus. To which of these shall I mine eare encline? Venus. Vnto the vpper world repayre. Thet. O no, I'le binde him in my flowing haire. PhÅbus. But see fond Mortalls how they gaze On that same pettie blaze? Thetis adieu, I am no longer thine, I must away, For if I stay, My Deity's quite undone, They will forget t'adore the rising Sun. Heere PhÅbus arises from Thetis lap, and speakes. But what new spectacle of wonder's this? And haue I lost my wonted Majestie Wherewith I use to strike a generall blindnesse Through all the Starres? unto what height of pride Are they aspir'd, that thus with open eyes They dare out-face mee? Call out a powerfull raye And make those saucie sparkes confesse that all Their lustre is a debt they owe to me. Venus. sings. Gently, gently, God of light, Profane not powers that are knowne To bee greater then thine owne: Here is not a fire doth shine That is beholding unto thine, They are of themselues diuine. PhÅbus speaks. And blesse them all the Gods. But how come I To be so blinde to day? so dull? so heavy? I know them now; Hayle fayrest Albious King, Liue still the envie of the world; and thou Resplendent Goddesse, to view whose glorious face I haue oft times in my swift course stood still; Be all propitious to thy wish'd delights. And since ye haue vouchsaf'd your gracious presence Here at the Muses Groue, command their Patron, Who here stands prest to serue yee. Venus sings. Will hee obey? PhÅb. speaks. Or else let Daphne frowne, Or Phaeton resume my Chariot. Venus sings. Then in their names I doe command thee heere Lord of the yeere, To entertaine This goodly Traine, Call backe that day of mine The sprightly Valentine. PhÅb. speaks. Command me kill a Python, or recall The Lion or the Crabb: thou art too modest In thy requests; tis done, and for to add A greater honour to this day, behold I will recall those few spent minutes too Which haue runn out since I appear'd, I'le back, And fetch new rayes that amorous Valentine, This morning may brighter then euer shine. At PhÅbus his going in, the Chorus sing these two last lines. After the Dialogue, enter a Boy. Ha ha he, here be fine feats. (I hope we shall haue a ballad made o'nt before night) ha, ha he, the Sun must lay aside all his busines, &amp; be at leasure (forsooth) to fetch back S t Valentines day for th?, ha ha he. In faith Gentlemen I pity ye, y'ar like to haue a goodly ComÅdy here, Plautus his Captiues translated, or some such thing I warrant ye: why your Poet cannot endure a woman; and there are likely to be sweet raptures where the Muse is not amorous and sanguine. But let me see, now I think o'nt, Ile go fetch him out to ye, &amp; ye shall laugh at him most miserably, &amp; the Ladies too; troth do, he deserues it. He has hired me this Valentines morning, (for so ye must suppose it) to lead him out hood-winkt with a black scarf, into the fields, because he would not see a woman. But Gods me! what haue I forgot? I should haue had mine eares stretch'd for it if I had miss'd it. Yee must suppose the Scene too to be here in England at a country village. Some low homely slight stuffe 'twill be, I doubt: 'pray heavens he does not heare me. And here's an other dainty absurdity too (which I care not much if I tell yee) concerning their cloathes, which as far transcend the condition of the persons, as the court does the country. But that they hope the Court will excuse, for had it not bin here, they had bin forc'd (they say) to keepe the true decorum. But to my charge whom I left at the doore, till I had discover'd whether the coast were cleare. Come sir, now you may venture, you haue a prospect as barren as an Eunuches chin.âO'me! why hee's run away. I'le be whipt if he has not smelt out my plot of exposing him to your view.âBut heere comes the Prologue, he perhaps brings some newes of him; I'le leaue yee to censure his legs and cringes. Exit Boy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. Vpon occasion of their Maiesties comming being deferr'd. Most sacred Majesties, if yee doe wonder, To be saluted by an aged Prologue, Know that upon these temples I doe weare An Embleme of our Mothers fate, who since Shee has in expectation of your presence Numbred the tedious moments, is growne old: For each expecting minute that has pass'd Has seem'd an hower, and every hower a yeare. But will yee see what power yee retaine? Wee by your presence are made young againe. He pulls off his head of haire and beard.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus Scena prima. Placenta, Constantina as a Boy, Isabella in Constantina's clothes. Pla. Fortune as yet is kind, well done my boy, Hold vp your head, a little higher, yet, And can you weep? Isa. I can, &amp; haue some cause, O Lucius! Pla. And sigh? Isab. I would I could not. Most wretched Isabella. Pla. Constantina. She calls at the window. Isa. When shal mine eies feed on that blessed sight? Or when wilt thou with one kinde looke dissolue This cloud which now obscures me? and makes me seeme Another from my selfe? Pla. Shee stirres not yet Why Constantina. Isab. O my Lucius! Might I but once more see thee, I could goe Vnto the graue me thinks with such a looke As should make death enamour'd on me. Pla. Ha? Not yet? O what a sleepy girle is this? Isab. But in this house I'ue learn'd Pandora liues, Who now does reape my harvest: here I hope I may enjoy at least a sight of him, And that is all that ever I must hope for. Constan. appears at the window But I shall be observ'd. Pla. O now she comes. Const. Placenta. Pla. Not so lowd (take heed) for feare The Dragon should be waking; haue you yet Got on your masculine habit? Con. Long agoe. Pla. Descend then, if your mind be still the same, Before the Sun rise to betray your flight. Const. But haue you drest the Boy in my apparrell? Pla. Tis done, and not a creature but my selfe And the dumbe night are guilty of it. Const. Well, I come. Pla. Introth I doe confesse I wonder What should induce this peevish girle to take This strange disguised habit, and forsake Her vncles house, but it is loue forsooth: Well, be it what it will, I haue procur'd, By her entreatie, and the gold she gaue mee, A boy as neere her stature as I could, Whom I haue cloathed in her owne apparell, And valyed in her scarfe. Come on my boy. You haue not yet forgot, I hope, th'instructions I read to you within. Come, let me see You vent a sigh now. Excellent: but be sure You speake not very often. Isab.

Shall I put forth my Paw, And so command him silence? Luc. But when I Forget to loue thee or thy memorie, May my white name be stained with the blot Of basenesse, and I dye without one teare To wash it out. Ant. Forget to loue her?âoh Not for a world.

Kitts Tobacco, And dabble there eternally: Luc. Ah Anteros, thou art too rough a Surgeon To handle my wounds. Ant. Pandora, ah Pandora. Does not this sound deliciously from a man? Luc. Doe not blaspheame good Anteros; shee is The modell of the world. Ant. Why so am I, And you, and euery man besides, wee all Are little worlds. Luc. But my Pandora is The abstract of them all; when she was borne, The whole house of heauen did meete, and there decreede Onely in her mortality should reach Perfection. Ant. And for heauens cause why in her? Are wee not all made of the selfe same clay? And of the same ingredients? by the same workeman? 'Tis madnesse Lucius this, it is not loue. Luc. Sir I must leaue you. Ant. Nay but stay a while, I haue not finisht yet. Besides all this, If you doe loue her so, what hinders then But you might marry her, since (as I heare) The Girle is not compos'd of adamant Or flint, but of a supple and kinde nature, And loues you too?

Why did ye suffer those vaine Lunaticke Poets So much to antedate the workes of nature, Who living many ages since did write I know not what of many Nymphs and Graces, Muses and Syrens? they are meere fables all; With my Pandora they had all their birthes, And when she dyes they'l perish with her. Pan. Ah? How like vnto this Dazy was I once Whilst I did live recluse! my innocent heart Like to this little Globe of gold, enclos'd VVithin the whitenesse of my thoughts, was safe From all the violence that Loue, or shame His childe could doe: but when his warmer beames Displai'd that Ivory guard, and laide me open Vnto the tyrannie of his assaults, I wasâbut I will sighe out all the rest.

Why here's a Parcell of mans flesh of another temper now, that has the art of placeing his affections wisely, can loue one because shee's faire, a second because shee's modest, and has his packets of reasons in readinesse too; if he meetes with a wanton Girle; that property takes him, there is hope of actiuity, shee will not fill a bed like Pygmalions Image before hee sacrificed to Venus: if shee bee rude, and ignorant, her harmelesse simplicity catches him; he loues this for the gracefull writhing of her neck; another because she can vayle her borrowed teeth neatly with her Fanne when shee venters at laughter: nothing can scape him, euery part of woman is full of limetwigs to him: which though it bee an humour contrary to mine, who care for none, yet I like it farre aboue your whining constancy as sauouring more of the Man.

Ha, ha, ha, Away you Ravens, I'le make yee all goe barefoot yee young villaines. Hee beats them in with his staffe. Scen. 4. Liuely solus. But let mee now muster my wits together Call all my fancies into ranke, and place Each severall quirke of this my working braine In its true file.â'Tis an unheard of loue, A miracle of Friendship this, for two young men, In th'exaltation of their bloods, both Rivals In such a beautie, for to plot and sweat How to be miserable, that's how to place His friend in the fruition of his Loue; 'Tis not within the compasse of a faith. This morning each of them entreated me In private, that I would invent some way To winne the whole affection of Pandora Not for himselfe, but for his friend: which is (Though in another Idiome) as if They should haue said, get me a comely rope My Bully Liuely, and hang me up, or else Provide mee an ounce or two of Mercury, Which I will take in posset drinke and dye. But Lucius is the man whom I desire To pleasure most, therefore I now haue counsaild Neander for to counterfeit a wedding, Which being fancied true by Lucius And the indifferent Gentlewoman, might cause A speedy marriage 'twixt his friend and her. This does he swallow, and now there nothing wants Butâha? what's here to doe? what Boy is this That Stipes thus dragges after him? Sce. 5. Lively, Stipes, Constantina, Merda. Sti. Why quickly Merda, bring me a chaire out quickly.â O O you villaine.âWhy when?âSo, so go to, go to, Tarry you still my daughter, That you may heare some of your Fathers wisedome.â Come on you Crack-rope, what is your businesse, 'pray you, To lurke thus in my Masters grounds? you are A scout? one that discouers are you not? Liue. It is a pretty Lad, and being drest May easilie passe for Woman. Well Ile marke Sti. O you're a stubborne gallowes, you will answere? Con. O mee vnfortunate; what shall I say? Sti. Heigh! An ill yeere on you, you great Maukin you, Merda playes with babes clouts. Making of Puppets? one of your age and breeding? You haue an Husband Minion? you a rodde.â But to returne againe vnto the purpose, Where dwell you sirrah? will you not answere me? Come on your wayes, I'le haue you to my Master.â Con. Vnhappy wretch! what shall I answere him? Nay good Sir stay, I'le tell you: oh how I trembleâ Sti. Then quickly Sirrah. Con. Lest this robustious Clowne Should hale me 'fore my Vncle in this habit. Sti. What's that you mutter on? you haue a tricke To say your prayers backwards? haue you not? Liue. This Lad is mine, I'le take him from the Sheepheard. Con. Not farre from hence I had both friends and parents. (Howsoeuer now I want) but cruell Fates Haue enuied them their liues, and me my friends. Liue. It shall be so, I'le make a contract straight Betwixt Neander and this Boy. Now Stipes, God saue you. Sti. Salve Domine. But why put you your Sickle Into my Haruest thus? go to, go to, You're troublesomeâwell Sirrah. Liue. Well Sirrah? Slaue, Thou vnpollish'd piece of clay, how dar'st thou thus Vncivilly vse a young Gentleman Whose friends and kindred I haue knowne to bee VVorthy of more respect then thou of scorne, VVhich both come neare to infinite? Sti. Very good. And doe you know his friends and kindred then? Liue. VVould thou didst know thy betters halfe so well, Vntutourd dunghill.âIn what state you sit? He ouerthrowes Stipes, chaire &amp; al. Stand vp, or else Ile make thee lye for euer. Sti. Are you in earnest or in jest? Liue. How thinke you? Stip. You great Rigs-norton you, doe you stand still Hee strikes her. And see your onely Father wrong'd thus? ha?â VVell, if I doe not fit your cap for this (If it be made of wooll) when you tithe Lambes, I'le neuer goe to Church more, if th'whole flocke Has any worse then other t'shall goe hard But some of them shall fall vnto your lot. Con. Alasse I doubt he knowes me His eyes so dwell vpon me. Liue. Come my boy, VVhat will you goe with me? Con. Thankes to my starres, He knowes me not. Stip. Boy will you dwell with mee? Thou shalt haue dumpling Boy, enough, and Bacon Shall be so deepe in fatt, that thou maist wade Vp to the chinne in lard: Salute your Master. Mer. And kisse your masters daughter that's the next Thing you must practise. Liue. You his Master, Hempseed? Mer. Truely me thinkes I could e'ne loue this Boy 'Tis such a pretty thing; Father, I pray you Good Father, let him dwell with vs. Sti. No more, Peace, so he shall. Liue. Hands off you lease of Sheepe-skinnes. Con. No, I will dwell with this old Gentleman. Liue. Well said, sweet youth. Con. But on this condition, That you will use me like a Gentleman Of qualitie and worth, for I must tell you With teares, how e're my fortunes are dejected Now, I doe come of no meane house nor blood. Liue. Feare not my boy, thou shalt haue cause to thanke me: Follow; my maids shall presently vnpage him, And hang woman on his backe. Con. But I doe hope aside That some kind God or other will find out Some meanes for my escape; if not (I'ue sayd it) This hand shall make a passage for my soule To leaue this body. Liue. Boy, doe you come? Con. I come. Exeunt Liuely and Constan. Merda playes with babies clouts againe. Sti. VVhat is he gone?âhi-day! what againe? Let me be hang'd, my dogge and my whole Familie, My Wife and all, I'le put her in, if I Doe not so 'flict your buttockes Minion; Ile breake you of this trade of making children Before your time, if I can find a willow VVithin a mile of an Oake. Exit. Mer. VVhat shall I do? oh what shall I do? what shall I do? My father's gone to get a rod, what shall I doe? Oh, oh, here comes my mother.â Sce. 6. Pandora, Placenta, Merda. Pan. Placenta, you haue heard my cares, my griefes And which hath caus'd them all, you know my loue, Now by those tender yeeres, by that first raye Of blessed light these infant eyes receiu'd Vpon those vigilant knees, I doe conjure thee Forsake me not in these my miseries Mer. Mother, Mother, Mother, what shall I doe? Pla. What newes with you, you fayrie brat? you changeling? Daughter to Madam Pusse the kitchin mayd, Take that and get you in, or Ileâ She beats her. Mer. Vm vm, vm. Pla. Will you not stirre? Carry that chaire in with you Milderkin. Exit Merda. Pla. What would you haue me do? Pan. Y'aue heard my sicknesse. Tis the physician must prescribe the medicine And not the patient. Pla. Will it suffice If ere the Sunne does set you doe embrace One of your Lovers? Pan. By all my vowes it will; Nor am I much solicitous in the choyce, So I haue one. Pla. But I must haue your helpe, You must not meerely be a patient In this same plot; can you dissemble thinke you? Pan. I am a woman, and may learne in time. Pla. Well then 'tis thus: you see your pampered Louers (Like two fat Oxen in a Stall) stand blowing Vpon their meat, are nice forsooth, and squeamish, Will not fall to, because they're cloyd with dainties, The onely way for to procure them stomacks, Is to withdraw their fodder; take your loue Before their eyes, and giue it to another, Or seeme to doe at least, 'twill fetch them back; And make them lick their lips at you, scratch for you: I know not by what Fate, but true it is, Wee neuer prize ought right till the departure, And then our longing's multiplied. Can you fayne A loue vnto some other Gentleman? And seeme quite to neglect them and their seruice? Pan. I feare I cannot, 'tis too hard a Prouince: But what will this aduantage me I pray you? Pla. So much, as nothing you can doe, will more. A Louer's like a Hunter, if the game Be got with too much ease hee cares not for't; Shee that is wise in this our wayward age VVill keepe her Louers sharpe, make them to ceize Vpon a firebrand for meat.âWhat say you? Pan. Why I will try I say. Pla. Try? Oh that I Had but that beauty in my managing, In-faith I would not part with a good looke Vnder a brace of Tens. Pan. Indeede Placenta As you art now, you'd neede to sell them deare, It is a rare commodity, your Shop Affords not many of them. Pla. For a kisse I'de haue a Lordship; a whole Patrimony For a nights lodging; Come, you Maydens now Are grown too kinde, too easie in your fauours, A few smooth, oyly, verses now adayes Bought of some Poet, and so iustly call'd The Gallants owne that sends them, where your tresses Are termed Sunbeames, and your rubie lips Congealed Nectar, haue more power to winne you, Then in my dayes two veluet Petticoates, Or an hundred acres turn'd into Taffaties. Speake, can you doe it? Pan. Sure I thinke I can, If need require. Pla. It is enough, but see, What Stripling's this comes here? Ha? 'tis most happily This is Endymion Lucius his Page. Sce. 7. Endymion. Placenta. Pandora. Endy. There's not a solitary walke, nor Groue Wherein a Louer may retire himselfe Free from the eyes of the prophaner people, But I haue trauers'd o're to finde my Master; I haue not left a Spring vnquestioned, Or any spreading Oake, whose quauering toppe Is but halfe PhÅbus proofe, nor can I heare Ought of Neander his companion. Pla. Pandora, this same Boy was sent on purpose Vnto this place by some kinde Nymph or other Inhabiting these Woods in meere compassion Of thee and of thy miseries; wee could not Haue studied for a better Stale then this: Prepare your selfe to faine a loue vnto him. Endym. But see Placenta, and my Masters Loue, I will enquire of them. Pla. Endymion All happinesse. Endy. As much to you Placenta. Pan. And what to me? Endy. What you deserue faire Lady, Which is aboue my wishes. Pla. But Endymion, Pri'thee sweet Lad, let mee entreat a courtesie, What Country-man are you? Endy. What Country-man? An English man I take it. Pla. An English man? I rather thinke thou art a Russian Thou carryest such a Winter in thy breast. How canst thou suffer such a winning beauty To stand neglected? without a salutation? Goe to, you shame-fac'd foole, goe kisse her, goe. Endy. How kisse her? it does not become a seruant To be so sawcie with his Masters Loue. Pan. It rather not becomes Endymion, A Youth of that same molde and symetry To be so bashfull 'fore a Gentlewoman: As for thy Master I disclaime his loue As one vnworthy. Endy. How? disclaime his loue? Pan. And with his loue, all the whole world of men, Except 'be thee my soule: why flyest thou mee? Pla. Come on, Come on you little frozen-nothing, I thinke wee must be fayne to make you take Your loue potion in a horne, you are so skittish. Endy. Nay but Placenta.â Placenta holds his hands whiles Pandora kisses him. Pan. O most redolent! Aurora's spiced bed is not more sweet, Nor all the odours of the early East. Endy. You do but mock me. Pan. How? but mock thee sweet? By all the Cupids in thy face, I loue thee Beyond th'expression of a womans tongue. Pla. This was that simple one that could not counterfeit. Pan. By this same nest of kisses I protestâ What would'st thou more? Endy. More of your protestations. Pan. But canst thou loue me then? Endy. Indeed faire Lady I doe not know, I am but newly enter'd Into this louing trade. Pla. You are a Wagge: Take her by th'hand and streine it gently, so.â Now kisse her fanne and sigh.âGood, excellent. (Well I haue seene some Gallants in my dayes, Though 'twas my fortune to be married, To that same lob my husband, but no matter;) Fy on this modesty, 'tis out of fashion, Giue her a greene gowne quickly, shee will thanke you. Endy. Will not as much sattin of the same colour To make her one doe as well? Pla. Come, you'r a foole; Downe with her, shee will discard you else, As bashfull, and vnfit for Ladies seruice.â [Pandora slips downe and pulls him after her.] Pan. Ay me! what meane you Sir? Pla. Why there, why so;â Oh for Neander now and Lucius To view this spectacle, this would crack that great That strong and mighty bond of friendship, and Make them both quarrell for her: nay Endymion, As shee did pluck you downe, so 'tis your office To take her vp, else shee'l forget her selfe Good soule, and slumber there eternally.â Pan. Now fie vpon you Sir, you've spoyl'd my linnen. Pray Heauens no body saw vs: good Placenta Reedifie what is amisse. Pla. All's well, All's well, saue onely here does want a pin. But stay I'le furnish you.â Yes, here's a knot molested too.â Pan. Faire Sir, This may seeme lightnesse in mee. Pla. Rather grauity Who naturally tend downeward thus. Pan. But Sir, Let me entreat you for to entertaine A better faith of her that is your seruant, Giue it the right name Sir, and call it Loue. Endy. I'le call it what you please faire Gentlewoman. Pla. Hee neuer thinks of's Master: well this Boy, Must wee trayne farther with vs till wee meete With our two icy Louers. Come Pandora Will you entreate your fayrest Paramoure T'accompany vs into the Groue? vvee may Perchance there meete his Master, whom hee seekes. Pan. Sweet shall I craue? Endy. Not where you may c?mand Pla. So, so, I'le now go plant this billing couple Exeunt Pan. Endym. Vnder some pleasant tree, which done I'le goe And range the fields for Lucius and Neander, And bring them to behold their close embraces, This certainely will make them hungry, and bite, Waken their dull and sleepy appetite, VVee neuer prize ought truly, thinke it deare, Vntill the time of parting does draw neare.â Exit.

Noddle. I say Sir, that it is your best course, to take heede how you make a deed of guift of your selfe, for feare some of your friends suffer for it, for the Physnomy of your boot, tels mee, it was neuer made for you, I doe not thinke but you borrowed them. Ham. And I say Sir, that it is better to borrow then to take vpon trust, and neuer pay, as many such gallants as you doe. Ante. Loueall, this heat is done, lets rub, and walke. Loue. Agreed, Master Empty, take some pitty on the Scholler, let him breath a little, wilt please you walke? [Louell &amp; Nod walke. Ant. and Ham. walke. Nod. I am your Seruant. Ant.

I was a very foole (as I said before) to bee drawne in after that manner, I would faine see the best cheater of them all, gull me of so much now. Wise. Well sir, I desire your better acquaintance. I haue the best wine in Towne for you, please you to accept. Mun. Thanke you sir. [They shake hands, he feeles him by the nose end.] Wise. I think you &amp; I are much vpon a complexion.

If it please you Sir to come to my lodging Sir, when you come to London, I shall thinke my selfe very much bound to you, I haue some pretty bookes there to lend you, I haue Aristotle's Problemes in English, and Albertus magnus de secretis, I, as I am a liuing soule. Lou. Let's take 'em off. [They part, Lou. walkes with Wis. Ant. with Mun.] Nod. Troth Sir you haue a very neat suit there, I am much taken with the proportion of your hose, 'tis a deepe French Sir. I haue a Sattin suit to make shortly, and I would bestow, some twenty dozen of gold lace vpon it, if I could but purchase the knowledge of such a Taylour as your's, I should thinke my selfe beholding to my Starrs for it. Ante. O your walking faculty, it is the only thing, now adayes your Gentlemen practise. Ham. Indeed Sir, I thinke it bee time for you to seeke out for a new one, for I thinke your old one will trust you no longer. Ante. Should you but see them walke in Paules, or in the Temple, with what a rauishing garbeâyou would admire. Wise. He, he, you are such a merry man, but indeed I hold that Tobacco is very good for Phlegmatick complections. Ant. Your hilt a little forwarder; very good, your very rapier sheakes French; I protest hee showes in the gracefull carriage of his legge, as though he had been a man of fourtie playes, fifteene moutings. Mun. Nay, I shall doe well in time. Nod. Gods me! you haue staind your cloake sir, how will you doe? I doubt the Gentleman that lent you it will be angry. Ham. Thinke you so sir? Ant. Well, there's no remedy, I must goe and relieue my Scholler.âSir, a word in private, do you know that gentleman? Nod. Yes sir, I haue read Overburies Characters; he is a silly fellow in blacke, I take it. Ant. Well sir, how ever you dis-esteeme him, I could wish you would take heed of him; I wonder hee did not strike you all this while. Go to, I say no more, I hold him to be the stoutest man of his hands in all this side o'th countrey. Nodd. Is he so? Ant. Why he is sent for far and neere by the valiant of the Parishes, to play matches at football: I tell you hee is the onely Hammershin this Shire can boast of; not a Servingman can keep a legge or an arme whole for him, he ha's a pension from all the Surgeons within the compasse of fortie miles, for breaking of bones. Nod. Nay for my part sir, let him be as tall a man as he will, I doe not care a pin for him, (doe you see) for I doe not meane to quarrell with him, onely I make account to jeere him a little. Ant. Well, take heed, say I. Nod. Nay sir, I'le take your counsell, I'le go and fetch my rapier I left within, and then let him doe his worst. Ex. Nod. Ant. Follow him, follow him, the exalted mushroomeâ a whorson butterflie, he ha's nothing to jeere you for but your borrowed cloake and bootes; and I don't thinke but they bee your owne for all his talking. Ham. No indeed, to tell you the truth, I borrowed them of a Batchelour of our house, mine owne lye in limbo at a Barbers shop for Tobacco. Ant. But why dost not beat him man? Gods me! beat him. Ham. Nay, I would haue bin at him, but that I was afraidâ They say many of 'em are very desperate fellowes. Ant. Faith, to doe them right, there be many of 'um that haue run through the discipline of a Bawdy-house, &amp; learnt to quarrell there, and haue seene the entrailes of a Fence-schoole too, and in one word are sufficiently valiant; but that proues not a generalitie. There are of them (I'le warrant you) as there are of your schollers, some that weare swords, only to scare fooles. Ham. Nay sir, I would haue you to know, that I am neither afraid of him, nor his sword: but I would not willingly die yet, if I could helpe it. Ant. Fear't not man, thou shalt liue I warrant thee, to see thy good name buried before thee. Haue you nothing about you to strike him with? Ham. Yes, I haue the key of my study dore in my pocket. Ant. O nothing better then that, follow him, to him, to him. Ham. Shall I, i'faith? shall I? Ant. Never stand, shall I? shall I? but doe't. Ham. Ne're goe, and so I will: Ile teach him to abuse any of our cloath againe. Exit Ham. Ant. St, Mr Mungrell. He whispers him. Mun. As I'm a Gentleman, and an elder brotherâ He runs after them offring to draw. Loue. But how now Anteros? what businesse is this? Ant. Can you but hold your peace, and follow them With your sweet William? nay, but will you goe? Ex. Loue. &amp; William. You'l loose the banquet if not presently. Scena 3. Anter. Endym.

Haue not that masculine rellish yet me thinks, Which I enjoy'd in the manly embraces Redit in scen? Pla. Of Lucius, or Neander. Plac. It is strange, Not one about this house that can instruct mee What should become of them, I wonder at it; But I am glad that Constantina's flight Is not suspected yet, so well that Boy Doe's personate her. Pand. Are they not there Placenta? Pla. St; No. O yes your Vncle is at home. It will not yet bee dinner time this houre; You may embrace another walke. Pand.

You set your minde on such a man? yet more? You might as well bee in loue with that same Sunne, And should as soone enjoy it. Ant. He speakes high, Pray heavens hee does not looke so high, for feare He should descrie me. Vrse. Father, I cannot last Out two dayes longer without Anteros. Ant. How's that? now all my starres be mercifull! It is a vision sure, this cannot bee. Hoo. Come, you'r a foolish girle, he marry you? That day that hee does marry you, will I Bring backe to life all that were dead before The universall Deluge. Ant. Nay, Ile helpe You with a farre better expression, sir, That day that hee does marry her, shall you Become an honest man; a harder Province Then to bring all the dead, to life againe. Hoo. There are a hundred reasons (daughter) why You should not hope it, first hee hates all women, Next if he did not, you that are deform'd, Lame, and mishapen, blacke, besides, ill manner'd.â Ant. (Hee does not see the wallet on her back.) Haue the lest cause to hope. Vrs. But there are (father) Sixe hundred reasons, why I should loue him. His manly carriage, his full breasts, his hayre, And his fine cloathes, his golden breeches, andâ Ant. His traiterous nose: I, I, 'tis that I know, 'Tis like the Ivy-bush vnto a Taverne, Which tells vs there is Wine within; but I Will take an order with you Sir e're long, And haue you par'd. Vrs. Well I will neuer leaue My crying (that's resolu'd) vntill I see him. Ant. O! Could I commit a crime e're I was made, 'Gainst nature worthy such a punishment? It is decreed, I will vnman my selfe, immediately. Hoo. What shall I doe? tis strangeâ Well,'t must be so: I will goe seeke Terpander, And mooue him to this match: most of his lands I haue in mortgage, nay indeed they are Forfeited to me, for the day is past Wherein hee was bound to pay in the money, The' advantage of this forfeiture, will I Threaten to take, vnlesse hee does compell, His sonne to take my daughter, to his wife. Nay, rather then I will bee disappointed, Hee for a portion, shall haue in his bonds, Come daughter, bee of comfort, wee will goe Directly to Terpander, where I'le vse Such arguments, as shall enforce him make His sonne both loue, and marry you. Exeunt. Ant. Like enough. 'Tis very likely Sir, but that this tree Does not afford any such fruit, I'd throw He comes downe. An old shooe after you,âsuch arguments As shall enforce him make his sonne, both loue, And marry youâwell how his pills may worke Which the old man, I know not: for my selfe I will prouide a quicke deliuerance.

Come on, you are a fine fellow, to go and set them together by the eares thus, are you not? Ant. But haue they done it finely? Love. Finely doe you call it? why your Scholler ha's so mauld Mr. Noddle with the key of his study dore, made such a breach in his Pericranium, that without question all his French ends haue taken their flight, through that passage; as for my cosen Mr. William, hee's crept into an old hole, behind the hangings, that in the dayes of old, h'as beene the Asylum, for decayed bootes, and shooes out of date, and there lyes hee, all alone, very melancholy. Ant. Ha, ha, he, but how was my Gentleman, and my elder brother imploy'd all this while? Love. As Gentlemen vse now adayes, in swearing; when he saw that hee could not draw his sword, hee ran vp and downe the roome, and measured out the time of the combat with oathes. Ant. Death! that I had but seene this. Love. VVould thou had'st: for I haue e'ene taken a surfet of them. I praythee let's inuent some way, or other For to bee rid of them, canst thou not thinke?

They'r Dog-kennels I take it Lov. They are, no more, but see they come, I'le slip Aside lest I bee seene. Ant. I wonder what His brayne is now so hot in travaile with. Sce. 6. Ant. Love. Wise. Noddle Empty, with his head, and face all bloody. Ant. How now? Nod. Lend mee your hankercher, if you haue one about you Cosen, mine ha's not a dry place in it. Ant. What doe you bleede Mr. Noddle? Nod. Yes Sir a little wild blood, hold that Cosen, vn peu Mounsieur. Ant. Did not you tell mee, all his French ends were gone? vn peu will not forsake him. Love. Not a word. Nod. A whorson cowardly slaue, to strike a man e're one was aware of him, and to giue one no time, to draw his rapierâ Ant. S'me, 'tis somewhat deepe I doubt. Nod. Nothing by Hercules Sir, a scratch, a scratch, well I'le say nothing, but by this good blood, that runnsâ Ant. Faith if you had done as that good blood does, Mr. Noddle, it had beene better for you. Nod. No Sir, I scorne it, I am not of that straine i'faith, and that hee shall know, the sempiternall rascall. Ant. Come on Mr. Wiseacres, I belieue you and your Kinseman are much of a complexion. Wise. I am very melancholy at this time. Ant. I but you must take heed of these fits, they'l spoyle you, I heard say, that you crept into a priuate, retir'd roome e'ne now, and there convers'd with spiders and crickets, fve vp-on it, you must labour against that humour; but indeed me thinks your Cosen is of a very deepe sanguine. Wise. Ha, he, you are such a witty man. Nodd. Cosen? Yes I am much beholding to my Cosen; I might haue beene kild for him. Ant. Come, come, I like him well for it, the Gentleman does weigh how much the Republ. might bee impeached, by the losse of a man. Nodd. Republiq;? Repuddingpy. By this light, a man is little better then mad, that will keepe company with such snowheapes, such white-liverd, counterfied lackdawesâbut all's one. Ant. I, I betwixt friends, and kinsemen; ye two are all one I know. Your Cosen is very cholerick now. Wise. I but I am very seldome so, for Albertus Magnus faithâ [Loveall as though he came from his Vncles.] Lov. Now the good Gods! where shall I find these most vnfortunate Gentlemen? Ant. Why how now Iacke? what inauspicious wind Ha's rays'd this cloudy weather in thy face? Love. O Anteros, wee are vndone, vndone; I'le haue this day wee are black ith' Calender, That after ages may beware of it, It is so full of Omenâ Ant. Whats the matter? I pray thee speake. Lov.

I would I had else. Love. Nay Sir, this is neither time nor place for such idle wishes, here ha's beene a Surgeon already, that liues hard by, and his sentence is, that hee cannot liue aboue two howers, hee swounded six times since you left him, it seemes you bruised him so with falling on him, with the hilt of your rapier, that hee bleeds inwardâI know not what to say to itâI was bewitch'd I thinke, nay thinke, thinke, thinke what course you will take, you must bee suddaine, the officers are sent for to apprehend you. Ant. Is this in iest (I wonder) or in earnest? Nodd. Is he so indeed? I pray you tell mee true Sir. Lov. Why, what doe you take mee to bee Sir? haue I this for my loue, and care of your safety? as you sowed, so reape for mee; I hope you will belieue your owne sences, I thinke I see the officers comming. Nodd. 'Sme! what shall I doe? Mr. Loveall, nay good Sir, I doe belieue you, I know not which way to take. Love. Nay there's no stirring that way, you'l meet them in the teeth. Nodd. What if I goe through the backe dore, and take horse? Love. They'l meet you that way too. Nod. Any thing, good Sir, I beseech you, looke the dore goes, I protest twenty Serieants could not haue strucke such a feare into me. Love. Well, will you trust your fortunes into my hands? Nod. And liues sweet Sir. Loue. Quickly then enter heere, I'le shut you in untill the search bee past: nay will you in? who's there? immediately, good Master William. He shuts Nod. into one of them. Wise. Nay sir, I'le go to my horse if there were twenty Constables, they haue nothing to doe with mee, for I am sure I did not strike a blow, no as I'm a living soule.â Loue. Gods mee, what will you doe? were not you in the company with him? that makes you accessary; haue you read so much law, and know not that? nay, will you in?âHa, ha, he. He puts him into the other. Scen. 7. Anteros, Loueall. Loue. What sai'st thou now my Anteros? Ant. What say I? I say thou art an arch-dissembler, A workman in the trade: By all that's good, I should haue been thus gull'd my selfe, thou didst So smoothely act it, with such passion, And anger at their incredulitie. I was afraid thou would'st haue beat the foole, Because he would not let himselfe be gull'd So soone as thou wouldst haue him, but stay nowâ How shall we dresse our other brace? Lou. That province Is yours; as for mine owne, you see I haue Provided for them, and conveniently: Yet if you will embrace my counsell, write After the copie I haue set you, doe, Behold a patterne, and see (happily) A chest where Stipes in the dayes of old Ha's kept tame Conies, now uninhabited. Ant. Right, but I feare, 'tis not capacious Enough for both. Lou. 'Tis nothing, looke you here, See you that fine spruce new erected hogstie On the other side of Stipes house? Ant. I doe. Loue.

Sir Hammer. Ham. Wu'd I might ne're stirre Mr. Mungrell, if I care a pin for a hundred such, an Inns oth'Court man quoth a? nere goe, I thinke they learne nothing there, but how to swagger, and bee proud. Love. Nay Sir, now I must chide you, will you accuse all, for the default of some particulars? by the same reason, I'le conclude, that all yee Schollers, are coxecombes, because I see one that is so. Ham. Meaning mee Sir? Lov. Meaning you Sir? pardon mee 'tis meere iniustice in you, I'le assure you Sir, this whole realme, yeelds not better qualified Gentlemen, and more gentilely parted, then many of them are, and to whom, the common weale is more indebted. Ham. Because hee has got a good suit of cloathes vpon his backe (I'le bee hang'd if they bee pay'd for yet) and a ring in's band string, to play withall when he wants discourse, he thinkes hee may carry the ball on's toe before him, and that no man must dare to meet him. Love. No more Scholler, you haue met with him sufficiently, why Anteros, when? and here's a braue Pylades too, that would not see his Orestes opprest by multitude. [Hee claps him on the backe.] Mun. Arrest mee Sir? soft, and easily Sir, more words to a bargaine; s'duds! I thinke my sword be mortis'd into a snayle, [Hee flyes backe and offers to draw] I cannot entreate him out of his shell. Arrest mee Sir? As I'm a Gentleman, and an elder brother, I owe no man a farthing that I meane to pay him. Nay come Sir, I am flesh'd now i'faith. Love. You will not quarrell with your friends Sir, will you? Mun. Friends Sir? I know not whether you be my friend, or no; I am sure you vse no friendly language. Love. Pri'thee Scholler, tayle off Mr. Mungrell a little, hee'l never leaue now hee has drawne blood once. Ham. Come, you'r a foole; the Gentleman's of worth, and our friend. Mung. Nay I haue done now, I did but try how I could quarrell a little. Lov. Faith Sir, this would haue made a faire show in a Country Ale-house. Mun. Nay Sir, as soone as my father dyes, (which will not bee long I hope, for hee lyes sicke now) I'le goe to Londorn, and learne to quarrell there, for a yeare or two, and then come downe againe, and practise amongst my Tenants. Love. Why Anteros; pray thee releiue mee. Ant. St, not a word, for a million of worlds. Harke you Scholler. [Hee whispers with the Scholler.] Mun. I hope you are not angry? Love. Angry old Bully? hee had a hard heart, that would be angry with thee. Ant. 'Tis as I tell you, his wound ha's beene search'd by a very skilfull Surgeon, and his Pia mater is found to be perished, and when that's gone, you know there is small hope. Ham. None at all Sir, I've read it in Magirus. Cozen Mungrell, come hither quicklyâ Love. Now, now, how greedily the Scholler sucks it in. Mun. What's the matter? but is this true? Ant. As true as you'r a Gentleman. Love. Hee never emptyed a buttry pot after a match at footeball, with greater appetite, then hee devours this gullery. Ant. Take heed what you doe, the least protraction is full of danger. Ham. O the Lord! what will become of vs? Ant. Loveall stirre the doore a littleâpassion O mee! there's some body at the dore, looke, looke, creepe into this chest, I'le shut you in. He shuts vp the Scholler. Ham. Any where good Sir. Mu. Where will you hide me sir? I'le goe into the chest too. Ham. Here's hardly roome enough for my selfe. Ante. Stay, stay, stay. In good sooth Mr. Constable here's no such men this wayâwhat say you, you three-penny cracke growne? I tell you, they haue already taken horse. Here, here, here, creepe in, stoope man, stoope. [He shuts Mun. into the hogsty.] Love. Ha, ha, he. Why so, wee'r now at Liberty, farewell. My sisters wrongs, and sorrowes call for mee, And shall be answered. Exit. Ant. Well adiew sweet Sir. I must bee suddaine, or I'me lost for euer. [tic. toc.] By this time sure my father melts (why sheepherd.) The ample benefit, that shall acrew Vnto him by this worthy match, this instant Arriues at's weather-beaten apprehension; (I doe but know it, am but sure of it) O, what a dainty pleasant thing it is For to bee free from care! to sleepe a night, Without the dreaming of a Creditour, Or the disturbance of that gobling Forfeit!

Ha, ha, he, I haue discovered more then e're Columbus, Or our owne water-fowle, Drake: my pretty stripling, Which I did take away from Stipes even now, Is prov'd a woman, prov'd an errant Lady, That is in quest after her errant Knight, Who is enchanted. 'Tis the Neece (forsooth) Of our good vertuous Iustice, Mr Hooke, Who has put on this habit for to follow Her lover Cleopes, who has forsooke her. All this did shee confesse to mee in private, 'Soone as she saw, I had descry'd her sex And name; but I haue stayd her pilgrimage, Shee's fast enough, I warrant her, i'th noose Of wedlocke now, to stirre in haste. No sooner Did I reade woman in her lookes, but straight I did command my mayds for to unpage her, And cooke her in her kind, in her owne sawce; Shee's pickeld now in some three yards of lawne: Here shee has it, and there shee has it, fie, fie. Was I a young man now againe, and should Venture on such a dish to carue, by'r Lady, I should not know which side for to begin on: Hardly distinguish breast from backe. Well, well,â Beshrew my heart the queanes, where e're they had them, Haue hung good rags about her; sure they borrow'd them.

These words doe favour of too much distraction. You must take comfort sir. Luc. Who's that dares talke Of comfort to me? But once name the word That is exil'd whole Nature? good Mr Liuely Wast you that spoke? Liue. It was, and I must haue you Remoue this same December from your lookes: I come to make you happy. Luc. Thou art come To loose thy labour then; I am below Both all the loue, and all the spight of Fortune, Shee will not make mee happy, and shee cannot Make mee more wretched then I am. I lye, Shee may doe both. But speake thou reverend head, Has ought that's good befallen my Neander, That thou dar'st venture out that name of happy So confidently upon me?âsay. Liue. There has, But more to you! Luc. What's that? Liu. Good, happinesse. Luc. How? happinesse to me? thou should'st haue put The space of fifteene ages 'twixt those words, They are so farre from reconciliation; Thou hast no Grammar in thee, know'st no concord. Liue. But I haue Musicke in me, and that's better. I'le make thee daunce my solitary one. Pandora shall be thine to day. Luc. How? mine to day? Liue. Thy wife, thy selfe, but in another character. Luc. Vnspeak't againe, it must not be. Liue. It must. Luc. Doest thou intend to buy me to thee? and To breake me and my fortunes with a courtesie, Which I shall ne're be able to repay? Imploy thy art then, all thy quicker plots To further my Neander in his loue: Who by how much the more his vertues be Greater then mine (who hardly haue so much As will redeeme me from the name of vicious) So much the more will apprehend the benefit, So much the more reward thee. Liu. Speak no further, Pandora's thine, shee's thine, thine owne, beleeu't. Hee is already married to another. Luci. I doe confesse that I am something fallen Oft from that height of reason which before, While I had libertie, I did enjoy: But thou do'st wrong me much, if thou do'st thinke That Loue has eaten up all man in mee. I tell you, I doe know your plots, your drifts, And all your consultations, as well As if I had had a cabbin in your bosome, And had from thence betrayd them; did not I Heare when Neander did sollicite thee For to procure a Masculine Bride for him? Did not I heare thee promise him to doe it? Hast thou not now perform'd it? are not they By thy procurement now contracted? speake; 'Tis not so easie to deceiue the eyes Of Loue, how e're our franticke Poets say He feeds on nought but Lolium. Liue. Lucius, As I doe hope to liue, as I doe prize My lungs, my breath, laughter, and sacke, (beleeue me) I haue Neander fast, hee's married To one that is as truely woman, as Was she that did produce thee, and because You shall be certaine of't, 'tis Constantina. Luc. But canst thou utter this (without a blush?) Or hath thy many yeeres Block'd up those channels of thy blood, that now They are not able to afford that face, (That starved face of thine, bankrupt of vertue) The least reliefe? but I'le undoe your plots. Since you doe force me, I'le confesse a secret, Which hitherto I'ue hardly whispered Vnto my privat'st thoughts. I am no husband, No husband (marke you) for Pandora, nor For any woman living; for kind Nature Has stamped Eunuch on mee from my cradle. Liu. What do I heare? Luc. That wc h is true. Li. An Eunuch! Scen. 3. Liuely, Neander, Constantina velatÃ¢ facie, Lucius. Liue. But see Neander comes with his new Bride. Nean. Why doe you weepe and sigh so boy? no more. Luc. Doe you heare that? Nean. But see my Lucius. I must quite alter my discourse, my garbe, And all my actions. Hence dull melancholly, I now must finde a face that must out-smile A morne in Iune. Lucius, a thousand hayles. Constan. Vnhappy Constantina! to whom Fate Neither permits to liue, nor yet to die. Liu. Break off those sighs you peevish girle, or i'leânot yet? Nean. What meanes this strange and ponderous eye? As though you were to take our Altitudes Lucius? what? and doe you smile? faith speake. How doest thou like my Choyce? perhaps you wonder At this so sudden match; but (Friend) you see What Love and a faire Gentlewoman can doe. Liue. I am the boldest wretch aliue. It cannot, Cannot be long before he needs must know her. What will become of thee then Liuely? ha? You must be sure not to unvaile him Sir, The boy would not be knowne. Nean. What muse you on So deepely Lucius? does your first sonnes name You shall beget on the most faire Pandora Perplex you now? come on, I'le answer for you, He shall be called Fortunate. Luc. Not so, Rather that name belongs to you Neander, That shall haue no such care to trouble you: For if my art deceiues me not (faire creature Your hand) this wife of yours is never likely For to beare children, but on her backe, or armes. Nean. Why pray thee sweet? Luc. 'Cause in this little vale That lies at the foot of Venus mountaine, here, I doe discover something too much for mother, Come, come, Neander, these are poore devices, Trickes of the Scene, and stale, they will not take. And you gray haires, me thinks that thou shouldst owe A greater and more filiall reverence To the faire Ceremonies of the Church, then thus To stalke with them, to make them stales unto Such base ridiculousâ Liue. Lucius, doe but heare. Luc. I will not heare thee. Liue. Here's a benefit Plac'd most deservingly! I doe not like it. Nean. I do not apprehend him. Luc. A faire gowne Indeed, and sope, and starch enough, to dazle The eyes of some young countrey heire, that has Never been drill'd through Drury lane, or Bloomsbury. But 'pray thee (friend) whose daughter hast thou married? What may she haue to name? Nean. What shall I answer? I am i'th bryers. Liue. Tell him 'tis Constantina Our Iustices Neece. Nean. Most excellent dissembler! As though you know not Constantina sir. Luc. But is this Constantina? Nea. True. Liu. 'Tis truer; Somewhat then you doe beleeue it is. Luc. Is this Iacke Loveall's sister? Nean. 'Tis. Luc. But is this shee Whom Cleopes once lov'd, and has forsaken? Const. O me! why doe I liue and heare that name? Liue. Did you not mark that sigh? how smartly't came? No, no, I haue not fitted you, I haue not. 'Tis a young Roscius I tell you. No sooner Was Cleopes nam'd, but the arch-villaine sigh'd, As if it had been truely Constantina. I doe not like this businesse yet. Luc. Is this That cryed up wonder? that Fidelia? A sodaine change. Sce. 4. Placenta, Liuely, Lucius, Neander, Constantina. Pla. Yet at the last? 'tis well, I'le giue the word Vnto Pandora: but with speciall care That the boy knowes not of his Masters presence? Liu. What businesse is't that this same Midwifes face Does fetch and carry thus about I wonder? Hy, shee appeares againe. Plac. All health old man. Liu. Old? and how old? but what's the newes that you Are rig'd with now? and whither bound I pray you? Plac. Next to that loving payre of friends, whose sorrowes I haue lamented oft, and amongst which I iudge it not the least, that while yee two Discourse in sighes, and teares, that wanton mayde That is the cause of all your heauinesse, Lasciuiously does sport herselfe, and melts In the embraces of an other. Amb. How? Plac. Regardles of your woes, or her owne honour. Nean. Now all the Gods! where is he? Luc. Woman speake, What is hee for a man? Plac. I know him not, So farre as to his name; but this mine eyes Dare witnesse, tis a composition Of blood and spirits not to be despis'd. A feature able enough to tempt; besidesâ Luc. Neander, whil'st wee striue about the shaddow Wee haue the substance ravish'd from vs. Nean. Ha? It cannot bee, 'tas noe affinitie With truth; It must not bee belieu'd good Lucius. Plac.

Nean. Most impudent woman, Did not our eyes behold it? Luc. O Neander, Why doe we stand thus coldly here? and not Hew out a passage through this prostitute To trauaile to the iust destruction Of her base Louer, and my baser vassaile? Pan. Rather let all your fury end in me, See here my naked brest imploy your valours: Why doe you stand and gaze one on another? What is the naked bosome of a Virgin A spectacle of such terrour? if it be, And that the fight of it hath cool'd your blouds, Then heare me speake: you Lucius may remember That ancient stock of loue, those many vowes, Those many teares, those many longings, which Haue past betwixt vs: nor can you iustly stile it A fault of mine, that Time is now so old And yet does see vs two; but partly yours Partly my fathers neerenesse (for I must not Giue it the name it merits, Couetousnesse) Who seeing your so feruent loue vnto me, Did striue to thrust me out with nothing, or At least with such a portion, as you lik'd not; Whilst thus I wauered, betwixt hope, and feare, It fortun'd, that this Gentleman Neander Became your Riuall: who had not long beene here, Not long sollicited, but I (shame of women) Began to loue yee both, and which is more I lou'd yee with an equall flame, (but see What Pageants Cupid can play I) it chanc'd (Contrary to all mens expectations) That by degrees such a strong tye of friendship Did grow betwixt yee, that each of yee refus'd (For his friends sake) what then was proferr'd you, My loue; whilst I bewayl'd my miseries Vnto this Midwife here, my friend, and grieu'd At this my harder fortuneâGood Placenta Shee weepes.

He sweares he will make hawkesmeat of my daughter. Ant. On my virginitie sir, he does me wrong; I did not charge a syllable upon him, But fell as coolely from me as a dow Vpon a drooping field; each word I vented VVas steep'd in an hony-combe. I did but bid him In a plaine, civill dialect to provide An other husband for his daughter: for I doubted that I should not be at leasure This brace or two of yeeres to marry her. And I may tell you sir, indeed I cannot. Hoo. O, O, am undone, cheate! and gull'd, undone, Villaine I'le bind thee to thy good behaviour. Ant.

Ant. Without all question I am the first, the first That ever pierie has made miserable.

Thinking it vaine t'attempt her in that shape, I presently did take some discontent, And fain'd a journey into Belgia, And not long after tooke on this disguise, And return'd hither; where I haue remain'd Your Rivall, and capitall friend together: And (which I wonder at the most) unknowne: You haue my Metamorphosis.

Hast thou (sweet friend) for me forsaken her, Whom thou didst prize 'boue thine owne proper soule? And now hast married her whom thou didst flie? And all for my sake, and shall I thus repay thee? But for her loue thou ne're hadst been Neander; And but for mine hadst been Neander still; Friend Cleopes, or if thou wilt Neander, (Vnder both titles most belov'd of me) Was shee all Venus; did each hayre of hers Fetter a Loue, were there as many Cupids That hover'd o'e her head, as there be lights VVhich guild yon Marble roofe, by them I sweare, By all that's Sacred, by what ever flyes The touch of mortall eye, I sweare againe, I would disclaime her and her loue for ever.

Surely some Power greater then all that Sex Is interpos'd, vayl'd in a femall outside, Else how come I so supple ioynted, that Before was stiffer then the Rhodian Statue? There is an Homage due, and I must pay't Spite of my proudest nerues. Most Sacred Goddesse, Behold a Penitent, that falls thus lowe Before your feete: as you haue showne your selfe More then a Mortall, in converting me, Confirme it by your Pardon; 'tis a Vertue No lesse deseruing, and as neere to miracle. And You great Monarch, that the world may know How nigh a Kin to heauen and all the Gods You are in bloud and power, confute that bold Erronious tenent, prooue the Age of Wonders Still to endure. What I haue promised Vnto this Shepheard (as a miracle) To be perform'd by Obron and this tree, Doe you effect; make vs all gentlemen. Which one Kinde ray sent from Your gracious eyes Will doe, and in that confidence wee rise. FINIS.</field>
