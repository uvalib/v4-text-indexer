      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGVS. The speach of a Ghost, one of the old Kings of Ormus. Thov Monster horrible! vnder whose vgly doome, Downe in Eternities perpetuall night, Mans temporall sinnes beare torments infinite: For change of desolation, must I come To tempt the earth, and to prophane the light; From mournefull silence, where paine dares not rore With libertie; to multiplie it more, Nor from the lothsome puddle Acheron, Made foule with common sinnes, whose filthie dampes Feed Lethes sinke, forgetting all but mone: Nor from that fowle infernall shaddowed Lampe, Which lighteth Sisiphus to rowle his stone: These be but bodies plagues, the skirts of hell; I come from whence deathes seate doth death excell. A place there is vpon no centre placed, Deepe vnder depthes, as farre as is the skie Aboue the earth; darke, infinitely spaced: Pluto the King, the Kingdome, miserie. The Chrystall may Gods glorious seate resemble; Horror it selfe these horrors but dissemble. Priuation would raigne there, by God not made; But creature of vncreated sinne, Whose being is all beings to inuade, To haue no ending though it did beginne: And so of past, things present, and to come, To giue depriuing, not tormenting doome, But horror, in the vnderstanding mixt; And memorie, by Eternities seale wrought; Vnto the bodies of the euill fixt, And into reason by our passion brought, Here rackt, torne, and exil'd from vnitie; Though come from nothing, must for euer be. The sinnes that enter here are capitall: Atheisme, where creatures their Creator lose; Vnthankfull Pride, nature, and graces fall; Mate of Mankinde, in Man vnnaturall; Hypocrites, which bodies leaue, and shadowes chose. The persons, either Kings by fortune blest, Or men by nature made Kings of the rest. Here Tyrants that corrupt authoritie, Councell'd out of the feares of wickednesse, Cunning in mischiefe, prowd in crueltie, Are furies made, to plague the weaker ghosts, Whose soules, entising pleasure only lost. The weaker Kings, whose more vnconstant vice Their States vnto their humors made a prey; For suffering more then Kings to Tyrannise, Are damn'd; though here to be, yet not to stay: For backe they goe, to tempt with euery sinne, As easiest it the world may enter in. My selfe sometimes was such; Ormus my state. I bare the name; yet did my Basshas raigne: Trusts to few windowes are vnfortunate; For Subiects growing full is Princes wane. Loe; all misdeeds procure their owne misfate; For by my trusted Basshas was I slaine: Now sent to teare downe my posteritie, That haue their sinnes inheritance from me. My first charge is, the ruine of mine owne, Hell keeping knowledge still of earthlinesse, None coming there but spirits ouergrowne, And more embodied into wickednesse: The bodie by the spirit liuing euer; The spirit in the body ioying euer; In heauen perchance no such affections be; Those Angell-soules in flesh imprisoned, Like strangers liuing in Mortalitie, Still more, and more, themselues enspirited, Refining Nature to Eternity; By being maids in earths adulterous bed: And idly forget all here below, Where we our parents, but to plague them, know. My next charge is, from this darke Regiment With wiles to scourge this age effeminate; Not open force, or humors violent: Time fashions mindes, mindes manners, manners fate. Here rage giues place, wit must rule ill intent. Proud honor being an ill for this State Too strong; sleight, must misleade the innocent; Craft, the corrupt. For though none dare be iust, Yet coward ill, with care, grow wicked must. This present King, weake both in good, and ill; Louing his trust, and trusting but his ghesse, Shall perish in his owne faiths wantonnesse; Betray'd by Alaham, whom he know'th ill, Yet to beware lackes actiue constantnesse, A destinie of well-beleeuing wit, That hath not strength of iudgement ioyn'd with it. Alaham his sonne; fond of the fathers Throne, Desire his idoll; libertie his might, As ouerborne with error infinite, Shall finde that fate all secret faults can hit: For he, that for himselfe would ruine all, Shall perish in his craft vnnaturall. Hala his wife; diuerse, and strong in lust, Liberall out of selfe-loue, of error proud; When shamelesse craft, and rage haue seru'd her turne, In prides vain glorious martyrdome shall burne. Zophi the eldest Sonne; whose reason is With frailty drown'd, and sillinesse confus'd; Borne but to liue, and yet denied this, (So well knowes power what spirits may be abus'd) Becomes the prey of factious craftie wit, Which stirres that ruine vp, which ruines it. Caine Bassha (like the clouds, who liue in ayre, Th'orbe of natures constant inconstancie) Now fame, now shame shall in his fortune beare; His vice, and vertue still in infancy: Change for his wisdome; and chance for his ends; Harm'd by his hopes, and ruin'd by his friends. Mahomet, with honor faine would change the tide Of times corrupt; here stopping violence, There contermining craft, and pleading right; But reason sworne in generall to sense Makes honor, bondage; iustice, an offence: Till liberty, that faire deceiuing light, Turnes mischiefe to an humor popular, Where good men catch'd in nets of dutie are. CÃ¦lica (because in flesh no seedes are sowne Of heauenly grace, but they must bring vp weedes) Death in her fathers murther she affects, Seduc'd by glory; whose excesse still feedes It selfe, vpon the barren steepes of mone. For humane wit wants power to diuide, Wherby affections into error slide. Heli the priest; who teaching from without, Corrupted faith, bound vnder lawes of might; Not feeling God, yet blowing him about, In euery shape, and likenesse, but the right; Seeking the world; finds change there ioyn'd with chance, To ruine those whom error would advance. Now marke your charge! Each fury worke his part, In senselesse webs of mischiefe ouerthwart. You are not now to worke on priuate thoughts, One instant is your time to alter all; Corruption vniuersall must be wrought: Impossible to you is naturall. Plots, and effects together must be brought; Mischiefe, and shame, at once must spring, and fall. Vse more than power of man to bring forth that, Which (it is meant) all men shall wonder at. Craft! Go thou forth, worke honor into lust. Malice! Sow in selfe-loue vnworthinesse. Feare! Make it safe for no man to be iust. Wrong! Be thou clothed in powers comelinesse. Wit! Play with faith; take glory in mistrust; Let duty, and Religion goe by ghesse. Furies! Stirre you vp warre; which follow must, When all things are corrupt with doublenesse. From vice to vice let error multiply. With vncouth sinnes, murthers, adulteries, Incorporate all kindes of iniquity. Translate the State to forraigne Tyrannies. Keepe downe the best, and let the worst haue power, That warre, and hell may all at once deuoure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus 1. Scena 1. ALAHAM, HELI. Alaham. Thou coward soule! Why standst thou doubting now? Why to, and fro? The dice of chance are cast: Counsells of law, of shame, of loue, are past. Thinke what the worst haue done; what they enioy, That plucke downe States to put vp priuate lawes, Whom fame enobles while she would destroy. Honor hath many wings: Chance hath no bookes: Who follow, treade but where men trode before; Who giue example still are something more. Beare witnesse yet yee good, and euill spirits! Who in the ayre inuisibly do dwell; That these strange pathes I walke of vglinesse, Are forc'd by threatning gulfes of treacherie, Nourisht by States, and Times iniurious. Nor is it sinne, which men for safety choose; Nor hath it shame, which men are forc'd to vse. Heli. What be these agonies indefinite? These sudden changes, secret, violent, Both argue euill lucke, and ill intent. Alah. That which I most did hate, and least did feare, Is fall'n: Nature cares not for natiue blood. I wickedly must doe, or mischiefe beare; I must no more be, or no more be good. Heli. How growes this change? Reueale this secret work: Both cures, and wounds doe oft together lurcke. Alah. Heli! you know the time when this fraile King, Languish'd, and wanton'd in a powerfull throne, Sent to the gods to learne what should befall, Hauing but peace; and wealth to doubt withall. Their answer was: My fathers eldest sonne Must be a sacrifice for this Estate, And with his blood wash out the doome of fate. The Basshas, swoll'n by vse of ruling Kings, Presume on God: and what by Gods decree Was death; by their must onely exile be. And proud againe with this vniust successe, A second error on the first they build; And he that liues against the heauenly doome, Must now not liue, but raigne: yet only raigne, To put downe me they feare, for him they scorne. Is innocency to no other borne? And must my right, and Royall blood abide Traytors, to be my Lords; the dead, my King? Is honor to so many masters tied? Shall I not liue, except I scorned liue? Well: where the choice is left to kill, or dye; The best Estates doe but in hazard lie. Heli. T'is rashnesse to commit our right to chance. Alaham. T'is madnesse at the worst to feare mischance. Heli. Vnfold this factious clowdie mysterie; What cannot help, yet will experience be. Alaham. The dayes be fresh, when all the world in hate With Mahomets supreme authority, The Basshas idly liu'd; no forme of State Obseru'd; no Councells held; no Maiesty; Weake spirits did corrupt; the strong did cast; Worth withered vp; craft only was in trust; The Court a farme; strange, ominous, ill signe, When publike States to priuatenesse encline. Such was my fathers frayle simplicity, As wanting iudgment how to stand alone; He (passion-ledd) could loue, and trust but one. The world saw all was nought; yet I saw feare Would, while it murmur'd, mischiefs councells keepe; So blind are men, or with respects a sleep. Enuy wrought more in me, and made me know, This passion in the King (which did aduance Mahomet aboue the reach of ouerthrow) Had counter-passions, change, inconstancy, For wit, and malice, possibility. I stir'd the King with enuies of his slaue; For great Estates inlarge not little harts. My charge suspitious, which no answer haue; Power still concluding all in euill part. With Kings not strong in vertue, nor in vice, I knew truth was like pillars built on ice. Factions besides I in the Basshas mou'd, And in their diuers witts my malice cast, Conspiracy with good successe I prou'd: For Kings are easily ledd away with many, That hearing all, want strength to iudge of any, Thus we exil'd him with pretence of State, Whom (it is true) I for my selfe did hate. But now, when Mahomet was banisht hence, His fellow Bassha's, fond of Gouernment, To rule their Prince with his name they intend, And ruine heires, yet seeme successions friends. For while I by my brothers exile stood, They hide their mindes to vndermine the more; And much to me in pittie thinges they leaue, That craft in good apparell might deceiue. Heli. Their craft, and power against you thus combui'd How could you shunne? or worke the Basshas so, As they might leaue to seeke your ouerthrow? Alaham. I found their crafte, and made my good of all, Some I did winne, the rest I did disgrace, Euen binding them by what they gaue to me: So great the scopes of braue ambition be. Nor staid I here; but as a man in doubt To trust this tickle art of men too farre, Where many witts to one kept subject are: I forthwith sought on fewer heades to lay This wardshippe of the King effeminate. A farre lesse seruile course for me, that meant To steale in change into this Gouernment. This made me thinke of Caine, whose spirits I saw Officious were, already entred grace, Pleasant, and fit to multiplie a place. The scruple that diuided him, and me, Was feare he did too much possesse my wife: With priuate scorne I waigh'd with publike ends; And saw, who will not see, needs no amends. For he, to hide his fault, straight puts on faith, And care of me; a badge of seruile lust, Which euer iniure those it pleaseth must. In him I did accept the sacrifice Of ruling him, that rul'd this wauing masse: Who cannot beare, what can he bring to passe? Now though by him the present state I gain'd, Yet to my after-ends this gaue no ayde: For their foundations only were, by fame, On peoples loues, and wonders to be layd. How little Princes fauors help the same They know, that marke what feet men goe withall, Who while they rise in grace, in credit fall. The people then it was that I must seeke, A future, not a present vse of power; Not strength establish'd, but a strength to change; To all, but onely those who worke it, strange. With this Caines place had no Affinity; It presage being of a Kingdomes fall, When Kings trust any one to gouerne all. His nature lesse, for it Monarchall was, Sharpe, narrow-humor'd, only fit to rise By that, which people hate, Crowne-flatteries, Since nature therefore cannot change her face, To thinke one fit, for all were foolishnesse, To force an instrument experience feares, Since wit may take of each the fruit it beares. Of Mahomet I then be thought my selfe, Whose absence pittie had. And as in sects, The present errors doe prepare a place For masked change, to shew her pleasing face: So did the hate of present Gouernment Forget his faults, as they forget their wounds. I saw that he alone did fit my ends; Occasion mother is of truest friends. My ends were not to broyle the present State, Nor leaue obedience in my fathers dayes; But after he was dead, to dispossesse My brother, whom the heauens did depresse. Chance wrought me good: left it should worke me feare, I meant to goe beyond the wayes of spite, Both stay, and winne the world with Mahomet: For who can stirre are fittest meanes to let. My father I did moue, remou'd, and sped, Feare made him pittifull, and folly kinde, In passions Orbe most patient to be led; Each argument begat another minde; Doubt had no memory, offence was dead, Distresse seem'd safety, likelinesse did binde: For in these captiue wits, borne to be thrall, Who sees one thought beyond them, seeth all. Mahomet returnes: But whether deeply shrin'd, Within the hollow abstracts of his heart, His malice lay; or that ambitious kinde Be easie, for it selfe, from all to part; Respect to me, and honour, layd behinde; Finding this King to be but humors art, He takes his soule, and miracles he showes; Restores the lost, th'establish'd ouerthrowes. My elder brother, whom the Gods fore-spake Lawes had depriu'd, exil'd, and men forgot, He straight calls home; and dares to vndertake That which audacity beleeueth not. Ah! Error of good meaning, apt to trust, For want of ill enough, I perish must. And am I borne for duties sacrifice, To watch for change of times, or Gods reuenge? Is patience scorne, and hazard yet vnwise? No, No: Confusion raignes; despaire is it, That now makes chance a God; and danger, wit. Inflam'd, distract, confus'd, put out of feare I am. Visions I feele of better hopes arise. Malice, and rage, whose heats had barrennesse, Are, with ambition of reuenge, made wise. Birth, chance, occasion, right, good fortunes be To some: and wrong can all these trialls be seuere: Heli. Alaham! I grant these trialls be seuere: But know; temptation is misfortunes spie, To worke in resolution change, or feare: Attend your fathers death; still hold you there; Before to vndermine a Monarchy Is hard. Besides, iudge you your own intent: For such your brother is in this to you, As you before vnto your brother were; He hath his owne, and you liue out of feare. Alaham. Who measures hopes, and losses by the truth, Goes euer naked in this world of might: Mine be the Crowne: my brothers be the right. Heli. Will you exceed his mischiefe whom you blame? Alah. When euill striues, the worst haue greatest name. Heli. Goodnesse is only at the greatest best. Alaham. Those mischiefes prosper that exceed the rest. Heli. Thou art but one: for all a sufferer be. Alaham. That one is more than all the world to me. Heli. Faults to the State all priuate faults exceed. Alaham. My wounds then heale, when all the earth doth bleed. Heli. Let father moue thee: Pittie thou the State. Alaham. Father descending kindnesse signifies: Our State is there, where our well-being lies. Heli. Fame euer liues, and euer will defame: The ruine of thy father; and his Crowne. Alaham. They euer prosper whom the world doth blame; Shame sees not climing vp, but falling downe. Heli. Yet feare thy selfe, if fame thou doest not feare; Reuenge falls heauie, when God doth forbeare. Alaham. Men only giddie be that be aboue, And will looke downe to doubts, when they be there. Shall name of King o'erthrow a Kings Estate? Hath publike good no friend? Shall priuate feare Of one weake man make all vnfortunate? No, No, deare Heli! I Gods Champion am; And will my father for a while depose, Lest he the Kingdome, we the Church doe lose. Heli. Alaham! If hands you on your father lay For priuate ends, and make the Church your stayres, By which you clime your owne ambitious way; Your glory will be short, and full of feares: Since nothing for the Church is done amisse; And nothing well done that against her is. Alaham. So be the God eternall my beleefe; As I my father from his State depose, Only for feare the Church should honor lose. But Heli! Iudge not things with common eyes; The Church it is one linke of Gouernment, Of noblest Kings the noblest instrument. For while Kings sacred keepe her mysteries, She keepes the world to Kings obedient; Giuing the body to obey the spirit, So carrying power vp to infinite. But here with vs, the discipline is stain'd; Forme lost; truth scandaliz'd with noueltie; Louingnesse with craft; and faith with Atheisme. Honor, and zeale, with curiosity; The worst best vs'd; shame carrying honors face, And Innouation king in euery place. Downe must these ruines to be set vpright; Misfortune peec'd growes more vnfortunate; And parents Lawes must yeeld to Lawes of State. Heli. Then see the means: For though the end were good, Yet for a priuate man to change a State, With Monarchs sleights to alter Monarchie, Seemes hard, if not impossible, to me. Alaham. Impossible is but the faith of feare; To make hope easie fetch beliefe elswhere. Yet lest these sparkes rak'd vp in hollow hearts, Should spread, and burne before their fury show; Keepe on the course which you haue vs'd to goe. Preach you with firie tongue, distinguish might, Tyrants from Kings; duties in question bring Twixt God, and man; where power infinite Compar'd, makes finite power a scornfull thing. Safely so craft may with the truth giue light, To iudge of Crownes without enammelling; And bring contempt vpon the Monarchs State; Where straight unhallowed power hath peoples hate. Glaunce at Prerogatiues indefinite, Taxe customes, warres, and Lawes all gathering; Censure Kings faults, their spies, and fauourites; Holinesse hath a priuiledge to sting. Men be not wise; bitternesse from zeale of spirit, Is hardly iudg'd; the enuy of a King Makes people like reproofe of Maiesty; Where God seemes great in Priests audacity. Thus keep a god: For be he true, or no, Mixt faith so workes on mans idolatrie, That minds, in bonds; bodies, delight in woe. Religion carrying men aboue respect: For what thing else can stand in selfe neglect? And when mens mindes thus tun'd, and tempted are To change, with arguments 'gainst present times, Then hope awakes, and mans ambition climes. Heli. What hope can blot the feare of Princes power? Alaham. Taxes, and scornes of Basshas gouernment, Which vnder Kings make present times still sowre; Hope leades the ill, and they the innocent. Heli. These hopes are poore: For feare is with th? mixt. Alaham. All feares are weake, where any hope is fixt. Heli. Dissolue (tis true) you may with enuy, feare, Craft, treacherie, contempt, neglect; Not build: these sands will no foundation beare: These engines are to ruine, not erect. Will you a father, can you a King throw downe? Alaham. Or suffer that the Christians weare his Crowne Heli. The Christians with what faith, or policy, Can you call in? Such remedies are ill: For what they conquer, that enioy they will. Besides, the force lies in Caine Basshas hands, In Mahomet wealth, law, and gouernment: What way to them? Alaham. My wife, their mutuall trust. These Basshas with themselues she shall betray; Arts of reuenge are written downe in lust. What cannot women doe with wit, and play? Heli. Who would bestow his wife in works of shame? Alaham. They that thinke ought more deare than honest name. Good fortune doth in humors market sit, And those that buy, must sell all else for it. Heli. The shame is sure; the good in hazard lies. Alaham. Such staires they clime, that vnto fortune rise. Opinion raignes without, and truth within: Who others please, against themselues must sin. Exit Heli. You spirits then growne subtile by your age! Not you that doe inhabite Paradise, Whose constant ioyes most vnacquainted be With all affections, that should make you wise! No: I inuoke that blacke eternity, As apt to put in action, as deuise! Helpe me, that haue to doe with Princes power, To plucke downe King, with Kings authority; And make men slaues, with show of liberty. Free hope from euill lucke, reuenge from feare; Ruine, and change adorne you euery where. Scena secunda. MAHOMET: ALAHAM. Mahomet. My Lord! So oft alone, pulls downe the heart To thoughts, and courses far vnmeet for it. Princes must show themselues in open sight; Men ioy in them that doe in men delight. Triumphs of common peace, sacrifice, thanks, praise, Prepared are, To solemnize this vniuersall ioy, Wherein your selfe the greatest part enioy. Alaham. If change were currant in Eternity, As here amongst vs in this mortall spheare, Passion might hope for counterpassion there. My brothers doome decreed was from aboue: Truth varies not: Gods pleasure constant is: Time present shewes not all that is amisse. Mahomet. Ioy opens mindes, and enuy shuts them in: God, by your brothers life, adiournes our sinne. Alah. When God speaks vnto men, and they expound, Truth easily scapes, all threatned woes seeme light; Misprision euer giues misfortune might: For power is proud till it looke downe to feare, Though only safe, by euer looking there. Besides; if fates be past, what meanes this starre, Whose glorious taile threatens vnglorious dayes, Feare vnto Kings, and to the State a warre? What meane these bloody showers? These darkned rayes Of Sunne, and Moone, which still eclipsed are? Are all signes chance? For if the starres can worke, These signes that threaten proue their bodies lurke. What added is in honor to the Crowne, Or what increase of Empire to the King; That exiles are call'd home to put me downe? Strange innouation some increase should bring. Kings fondly else tempt God, and trust to chance, Where change, and hazard nothing doe aduance. Mahomet. Your brothers fault was only Princes feare; One ill example hurts to many were. Alaham. Gods law it was, wherby he was depriu'd; My elder brothers right, was but the law. Change in Estates is like vnto a steepe, Which, but it selfe, can nothing constant keepe. Mahomet. It is no chance to giue the elder place. Alah. The wounds are new that present right deface. Mah. The second borne are not borne to the Crowne. Alah. Hope, which our God sets vp, dare man pull downe? Mahomet. Alaham! Our Gods decree did not exile Thy brother: It was heauenly mystery, Which faction construed to impiety. When I return'd, I saw foundations layd In Princes faults, for Basshas tyrannie; Who keeping both the Princes heyres aliue, The one exil'd, the other enuious, Would make each plague to other; both, to vs. I wrought, and ouercame the Princes hate, Restor'd his sonne, and in his sonne the State. Alaham. And wast thou then call'd into grace by me, To be the meane that I should ruin'd be? No Mahomet: That Labyrinth thy heart, Artisan of craft, great Empire of deceipt, The plague of all inferiors, and the bait; In Princes frailty shall not drowne this State. Sense and thy wrongs alike be generall; A Princes power cannot protect them all. When flattery giues scope to tyrannize, Extremes then from extremities doe rise. Mahomet. The giddy head that sees with daz'led sight, Imagines all the world to turne about: And rage, which to your selfe makes you seeme great, Is lesse to me, than if you did entreat. Alaham. Who truth doe only but to hate it know, They nothing feare, but only to be good: Vnthankfulnesse is euer valiant so. Mahomet. To them God thanklesse seemes, not thanklesse is, That sacrifice for leaue to doe amisse. If wrongfully you had not banish'd me; To whom could my returne thank-worthy be? Alaham. Our gods seem'd wroth; and fame spake strangely ill. That sure my Wife did worse than dote of thee; This was dishonor, wrong, and losse to me. Yet I distract with good beleefe and feare, Detest her could not; loue forbade it me: Loue her I did not, for mistrust was there; While I suspected her, I hated thee. At length ('t is true) I got thee banished; If not reuenge, at least security: Till humorous Time, that blots to print againe, Shew'd me in Hala's thoughts Caine Bassha's name. I call'd thee home; and though I scorne still beare By fame, who when she lies, recanteth not, Yet I forgaue the shame, and pardoned feare; Brought thee good lucke, where good turnes are forgot. And is it a returne of that you owe, For you to worke your Patrones ouerthrow? Mahomet. Alaham! Put off this fruitlesse peeuishnesse Of expectation, lost in ill desires. For you, in witnesse of my thankfull heart, The Gouernment of old Ormus I got; And by possession mans hope loseth not. Alaham! Besides, iudge both your thoughts, and State: Kings children are no Kings; Authority Goes not by blood; she sets another rate: Vse, is her kinne; Grace, her affinity. Then looke not on desires earnestnesse; Impossible is easie there, wishes effect, The future great, the present euer lesse: Comparison still carying vp the eye To make all that we haue but miserie. Care, bought with blood; and feare, with treacherie; Danger, with wrong; and shame, with venturing; Vncertaine hopes, and certaine misery, The fortunes be of haste to be a King. Alaham. O God! what's this? Mine inward spirits shake; Senses doe leaue their worke; thoughts are confus'd; Horror and glory now possession take; New visions to my darknesse are infus'd: Like Delpho's mayd, I find a mightie worke; My heart with more than it selfe doth resolue; What I thinke, speake, or doe, is not mine owne. I feele what made me wish my brothers fall, And finde what mischiefe gets, it goes withall. His safety now, I see, my safety is; And honor you, that haue procured this. Mahomet. A blessed worke, if it be wrought within. Alaham. It is no worke: it is a heauenly blisse, Which perfect be, as soone as they beginne. Spite! (thou Impostume of aspiring hearts, Whose nature is, that if the bagge remaine, The wicked humors straight will fill againe) I will lay open thee, and all thy arts: It is no shame to say we were amisse, Since man doth take his name of that he is. Thy life is sought: Nay more, thy death is sworne. Mahomet. By whom? Alah. By them that hate, because they loue. And eithers kindnesse doe in mischiefe proue. Mahomet. What is my fault? Alah. That thou of fault are free. Mahomet. What his reward? Alah. Their loue that malice thee. Mahomet. Where lies my hope? Alah. To kill, or to be kill'd. Mahomet. A wicked choice, where mischiefe is the best. Is their delight in shedding guiltlesse blood? Alaham. What moues the wicked else to hate the good? Mahomet. Who be the men? Alah. I to my selfe am free; But faith forbids to tell what others be. Mahomet. Disperse these clouds: Secrecy is euils friend; Neutrality hath neuer noble end. Tell me their names, that I my foes may know, And you, with honor, from ill friendship goe. Alaham. I witnesse take of these light-bearing starres, Wherein the doomes are laid of mans desires; No lacke of hope, or power, to conceale; Remorse alone doth them, and me reueale. My wife hath compass'd Caine so cunningly As he hath sworne you, by his hand, shall dye. Mahomet. Vncredible it is to thinke men neuer change; To thinke they alter easily, is a strange. Vpon what grounds should this strange malice moue? Alaham. Vpon what grounds doe men beginne to loue? Mahomet. What moued Caine? Alah. That which I may not see: For they loue well that doe in hate agree. Mah. Are truth and friendship but ambitious traps, To feed desire with all that she can get? Are words, and good turnes but hearts counterfeit? Alaham. When enemies bid enemies take heed, They trust not them, and yet they will beware; For disaduantage growes of little care. Resolue to die; or else resolue to feare. Mahomet. Good Angells still protect the innocent: Hell would haue all, if harme were ill intent. Alah. Mischiefe still hides her selfe from them she hits, In hopes, and feares of vnresoluing wits. Mahomet. I well know Caine: his nature to excesse Of good, or ill, is forc'd by industrie: In others spite lies his impietie. Appease your wife: for that must lie in you. Alaham. Call vp the dead; for that is lesse to doe. A womans hate is euer dipt in blood, And doth exile all counsells that be good. Mahomet. Reason and truth shall pleade to her for me. Alaham. The eyes of rage it selfe doe only see: And truth serues vnto rage, but for a glasse To decke her selfe in, and bring spite to passe. Reason to rage is like hands to a sore, Whose often stroking makes the anguish more. Mahomet. Impossible all counsell doth refuse. Alaham. Let Caine be kill'd: and then my wife accuse. Mahomet. My heart shall first take counsell with my fate: If it foretell the worst, it teacheth feare; If it diuines no ill, how can it hate? If what shall fall it feeles not; I must beare. The time growes on: The King (I know) makes haste To sacrifice to God: For common ioyes Are made much dearer by the sorrowes past. CHORVS PRIMVS, Of good Spirits. We that are made to guard good men, and binde the ill, See both miscarried here below, against our power, and will. As if the earth, and hers, were to the worst left free, And we made subiect, by their curse, to deaths blacke Colonie. Yet is our Maker strong, and we his first Creation, Wheras the state of that darke Quire is meerly our priuation. Whence doth this ods then grow, which seemes to master all; Since we are more than nature is, they much lesse, by their fall? Are we not diligent, or is the good not wise? Showes Truth lesse glorious in the earth, than her ill picture Lies? Then Audit vs in grosse; at least we equall be: And if in minutes men seeke out true inequality, Compare words with the life, Eternity with time, Insulting pride with humble loue, pure innocence with crime: And if these in their natures equally be weigh'd, The one liues euer building vp, what others haue decay'd. So that to make and marre, is our true difference; To marre, expressing finite power; to make, omnipotence. The obiect then it is, from whence this oddes doth grow, By which the ill o'reweighs the good in euery thing below. And what is that but Man? A crazed soule, vnfix'd; Made good, yet fall'n, not to extremes, but to a meane betwixt: Where (like a cloud) with windes he toss'd is here, and there, We kindling good hope in his flesh; they quenching it with feare. We with our abstract formes, and substance bodilesse, Image by glaunces into him our glories, their distresse. And in prospectiue Maps make ill farre off appeare, Lest it should worke with too great power, when it approacheth neare. Beauties againe of Truth (which those ill spirits conceale) With Optike glasses we reflect on man to kindle zeale. But whether idle man, exceeding orders frame, (As out of heauen iustly cast) must Vulcan-like goe lame; Or that those euill spirits so dazle humane eyes, As they thinke foule forbidden things more beautifull, more wise; Wee see, though they want power to change our reall frame, Yet in the world they striue to gaine, by changing of our name: Calling the Goodnesse, weake; Patience, a lacke of sense, Or seeming not to feele, because it dares make no defence. True Pietie in Man, which vpward doth appeale, They doe deride, as argument of little strength, much zeale. And as the Painters art, by deeping colors there, Here sleighting o're, and finely casting shadowes euery where, Makes from a flat, a face shew off, as if imboss'd; In which the forme, not matter, is the summe of all his cost: So take these Fayries from, or adde vnto our meane, With arts fine casting shadows, till they seeme to change vs cleane; And make a picture which they couet should excell; And which yet, to be like, must lose the life of doing well. This image is their wit, and so their Deitie, Which though not keeping one shape long, in all would worship'd be. In precept, doctrine, rite, and discipline agree'd, That, but prosperity on earth, there is no liuing Creed: Out of which fatall guide Alaham now vndertakes The ruine of his King, and father, for ambitions sake; Against the lawes of Nations, power, and natiue blood; As if the vttermost of ill a Scepter could make good. But marke how Vice still makes example her owne fate; For with like mischiefe Hala shakes both him, and his Estate. He in his fathers bowels seeks an earthly Throne; Whence she supplants his heires againe with bastards of her owne. He makes wrong triumph ouer right, and innocence; She makes her lust religions lord, confusion her defence. Thus, as that Tyrant who cut off the Statues head, Which bare the name of Iupiter Olympian christened; Euen by this scornfull act to what was God in name, Taught people to encroch vpon the sacred Monarch-frame: So while the o'reswoll'n pride of this Mahumetan, By wounding of his Princely race, playes false with God and man; He in it doth disperse those clouds of reuerence, Which betweene man, and Monarchs Seate keep sweet intelligence; And while he would be lord of order, nature, right, Brings in disorder, that deuouring enemy of might, Which with her many hands vnweaues what time had wrought, And proues, what power obtaines by wrong, is euer dearly bought. So that our griefe and ioy is in this Tragedy, To see the ill, amongst her owne, act vnprosperity; The corne fall to the ground, the chaffe in siues remaine, Which of the corne was once, and yet cannot be corne againe. But as their ancient mates the sudden-kindled Windes, Broken out of the watry clouds, wherein they were enshrin'd; Afflict the sturdy Oke, are heauy to the Reed; And equally spend out th?selues with good or euill speed: So of these windy spirits, which wander in the ayre, By their malignity to blast, both what is foule, and faire; Whether they prosper doe, or faile in their intent, Their vglinesse disclosed is, their violence is spent: While we vphold the world, and were we all but one, By Legions of those Angels curs'd, could not be ouerthrown'd. Yet among stories, as the Authors winne no praise, Which truly write; but they who time with flatteries doe please: So in mans muddy soule, the meane doth not content, Nor equally the two extremes; but that which fits his bent. This makes some soare, and burne; some stoope, and wet their wings; And some againe commit excesse, euen in indifferent things. For who maintaines one vice to multiply another, Incestuously begets more heyres vpon his owne first mother. And in Venerian acts, as Concubine, and wife, Only expresse that difference which pictures do from life; The act being all in one, and but the same in all, Saue that the bondage of the vice delighteth to enthrall: So in mans choice, suppose this ends indifferent: The good, and ill, like equall wayes; yet will the worst content.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus Scena prima. HALA alone. Hala. I will no more smother confusedly This inward warre, where modesty and shame Would subiect sense to duties Tyrannie: Wronged with doubt I liue; a wife to lust, A stranger both to honor, loue, and trust. My friends despis'd, my seruants made my spies; No way, but by betraying me, to rise. Is this the only right of womanhood? Then know base Men, in whom all loue is lost, That wit moues wit; power, feare; feare, hate; No farther bondage hath a wiues estate. While Mahomet, that faithlesse hypocrite, Canker of loue, All-ill in one, that man Shew'd loue to me; Alaham was wroth, an husbands honour touch'd, He vile, I worse: the eyes of Iealousie Seeing her owne disease in him, and me. But since this wretch, with his aspiring craft, To Alaham hath falsly sold my shame, My iniuries and dishonours are his fame: And shall this traffike of ambition thriue, And bury vs in modesty aliue? No Caine: For thy example I resolue To study spite, and practise cruelty: Scorne else will grow their sport, our falls their fame, That glory to deceiue, and ioy in shame. But what means this? Alaham hasts to the Crowne; He tries, moues, breakes all that will not be bowed; Those only stand which helpe his father downe. Wife is a priuate name: Ambitions wayes Lie not within the bounds of loue, but vse: When things are ripe, I must be ouerthrowne. And shall I lose my selfe in idle lust? Each Vassall is as great as Queenes in it. Princes haue strength, they erre for Empire must. What feare I then? Fame that is great, is good: Hazard all men behold with reuerent eyes; And must we only in remorse be wise? No, no: My heart, and State doe more embrace: Purple shall hide my lust, a Crowne my shame: Passion with passions hath such vnity, As one must euer be anothers frame. Beyond the truth I am in louing Caine: The monuments of lust are secrecy, Suspition, shame, remorse, aduersity, If Caine be King; the wayes to that are change, Wrong, hazard, care, ruine, confusion, blood; Poore thoughts, that fear, or rest, haue neuer good. My partie's strong: I build vpon the vice, Question the yoke of Princes, husband, law; My good successe breakes all the links of awe. Then Chance! be thou my friend: Desire! my guide. My heart extended is to great attempts, Which, if they speed, eternize shall my fame; If not, 'tis glory to excell in shame. Loe where my Husband comes! Now reason must Disguise these passions, lest I lose my end; Who hides his minde is to himselfe a friend. Scena secunda. Hala, Alaham. Hala. King of my selfe! Redeemer of our fame! What secret clouds doe ouercast your heart? Counsell, and time doe both worke one effect, And either cure, or cleare what we suspect. Alah. My wounds can haue no cure; my feares haue cast Nature, and truth into afflictions moulds; The workes of time, and counsell both are past. When hearts once from themselues are runne astray, Chance must their guide be, violence their way. Hala. Chance is not cast in moulds, like other Arts, Her counsells but the hope of rashnesse be; Aduice did neuer any man betray: If truth be luckie, counsell is the way. Alaham. If counsell be the guide of vndertaking, Our powers best with our owne wits doe agree, Where both the meanes, and ends together be. Hala. Who trusts his passion multiplies his care; All paines within, all cures without vs are. Alaham. If you captiued be I speake withall, Then from my passion into yours I fall. Hala. My state of minde, good will, and homage is; My being, reuerence; my end, your will; Selfe-loue it selfe payes tribute vnto this. Alah. If loue haue power to leaue, and breake her vow; How can I trust to that you promise now? If loue change not; how can I trust, and know, That you loue Mahomet, my ouerthrow? Hala. His place deseru'd respect, his vertue praise; Our freedome, not inhibited by you, Found many things indifferent to doe. Alaham. Forbidding is the prison of the thought, A violence which on themselues they draw, That inwardly of nothing stand in awe. But marke the end: he first despiseth thee, Then triumphs in thy once forsaken loue; Proclaimes deceipt to be thy state of mind, Vncompetible, vnpossible to finde. So as if I should rule this glorious Throne, You ruling me (as he assumes you doe) The State and I at once were ouerthrowne. Hala. Good nature then (I see) is not the art, With which a womans honor safe may goe Through hollow seas of mans dissembling heart. His faithlesnesse yet doth this good to me, That I may freely hate all men, but thee. Alaham. Hate is the band of furie in the heart, Without reuenge, no more but sense of smart. Hala. Hate is the print of iniurie violent, Only in ruine, and reuenge content. Alaham. Reuenges, in your sex, dishonor be; And in your strength, impossibilitie. Impatience only doth with God make warre. Hala. Furie findes armes; wronghath ill destinie; While God is, it is basenesse to despaire: For right more credit hath than power there. Alaham. Yet God, and kings vse wisdome in their might, Reward, and grace doe from their owne hands part; They others vse for instruments of spite. Hala. Whom can we vse? Since he we hate is great, And we disgrac'd: Who hazard will his State With him, that for his owne good must intreat? Alaham. Aspirers are not voyd of riuall hate: If any enuy him, or loue our right, Reuenge lies there; their liues desire Art. Hala. Of God I aske it; and in men will moue, As much as can be wrought with hope, or loue. But men vncertaine are, blowne here, and there, With loue, remorse, feares which in frayltie liue; Who need forgiuenesse, easily doe forgiue. The heart which feeles, most liuely can expresse Reuenge, that picture of his guiltinesse. Alaham. Ruine, the power (not art) of Princes is: Caine is ingag'd as deep as we in this. Hala. The wounds are mine; to me belongs reuenge; Sense my aduiser is; you Sir, my end: What needs a womans passion more to friend? Alaham. Mischiefe! now claime thy due. Malice! feare not, To offer all thy sleights to wicked wits; Ruine lights not amisse where ere it hits. My engines worke, care is already past; My hopes arise out of these Basshas blood: If both, my wish; if either dye, my good. Hala! Good fortunes are together linkt; Thy faith stirres vp new light within my minde: Behold, the Throne descends to take me vp. Antiquitie, in her vnenuied wombe, Now offers vs the fatall president Of sixteene Kings, my Predecessors, all Blinded, and then depos'd by Basshas hand: So tickely vnworthinesse doth stand. Doth wit, and courage only rest in slaues? Hath hazard ought more horrible than scorne? Haue I occasions sure, and shall I stay To giue all, but my miserie, away? No Hala, No: Thy dowrie shall be fame; Thy stile, a Crowne; thy prospect, reuerence: The East shall doe thee honor in my name. Out shall my fathers, and my brothers eyes; Authority is only for the wise. But since these mighty workes haue many parts, And I but one, which one cannot doe all; Ile send thee Caine: keepe firme vpon your strengths. Beauty, and honor, natures Scepters be, And haue on mens desires authority. Exit. Hala. Now Hala, seeke thy sex; lend scorn'e thy wit, To worke new patterns of Reuenges in. Let rage despise to feed on priuate blood; Her honor lies aboue, where danger is, In Thrones of Kings; in vniuersall woe. Worke that which Alaham may enuie at, And men wish theirs, that Ill it selfe may tremble. Monstrous, incredible, too great for words. Keepe close, and adde to furie with restraint; Doe not breake forth vntill thou breakest all. Is Wrong so proud? Shall Man once dare to fashion A Womans ruine, in a womans passion? Husband! most odious name: scorne of subiection. Is loue to women but your rage of thoughts? Are your desires let blood by your enioying? Ah fooles! We see your lusts relent, you see not ours; And from that change aduantage hath her powers. But on: Still vse thy craft: Thy strength lies there. Ignorance, that sometimes makes the hypocrite, Wants neuer mischiefe; though it oft want feare: For while thou thinkst faith made to answer wit, Obserue the iustice that doth follow it. Caine, Mahomet, and me thou hat'st alike, For vnlike cause, and craftie wayes do'st take, That each may ruin'd be for others sake. Shall I, for thee, hazard Caines life I loue? And weigh downe my affection with my hate? Can highest thoughts haue any thing aboue? Ah! but perchance my safety in the blood Of Mahomet doth rest, the good of Caine: Then were it losse to make occasion vaine. And shall I looke but only to be safe? Can Iniurie and Malice adde no more? Ah coward sex! faint, shallow Passion Farre from me be: A worke that no age dares Allow, yet none conceale, I must attempt. Furie! then spurre thy selfe, embedlam wit; Poyson my thoughts, to make my reason see Pleasure in crueltie, Glorie, in spite: Rage to exceed examples doth delight. Thoughts! doe you blush? To Alaham what's ill? His death? O barren wit, and sandie rage! No marble pillars, no enamells rich, Buried in silence, worne away with age, Are furies that no greater plagues deuise: Horrors they be that haue eternities. What saith my heart? Grow millions out of one? Doth passion leaue her infancie by vse? And shall I, by the death of Mahomet, More skill, at least more crueltie beget? Then let him die. But can I venture Caine, And leaue misfortune power ouer loue? Triumphs to Alaham, if both be slaine? Ah sleepy Sexe! how slow is their progression, That would exactly measure infinite, By tender feares, or minutes of delight? Then Hala, leaue this circle of selfe-loue. Beginne; goe on: hate must stride ouer feare. Who are secure, And nothing venture, all things must endure. For Alaham, that traytors ouerthrow, My rage is yet too yong to worke vpon: What to resolue of him I dare not thinke, Till this great frame, wherein our fortunes lie, Be surer linkt vnto prosperitie. Then shall occasion horrors strange deuise; Fooles only lose their ends to tyrannize. Scena Tertia. Caine Bassha, Hala. Caine. Princesse of me! I finde care in your face, Woe smothered vp; I came to know your will; Nothing which you command me can be ill. Hala. That which I least did feare is fall'n on me, Wrong and mishap; which needing others loue, Makes them vnlouely that vnhappy be. From Kings themselues when fortune turnes her face; Then need they most, yet least may vse their owne. So dearly Mans vnthankfulnesse is knowne. Caine. What is the cause that makes you thus accuse The world of faults, your selfe of inward feare? Hala. The little faith which all the world doth vse; The iniuries which strength of heart must beare: Euui'd of all, if it be set aboue; If humble, then too low for men to loue. Caine. Doe not forsake your selfe: For they that doe, Offend, and teach the world to leaue them too. Mortall our God shall be; the truth shall lie; Darkenesse shall see her selfe; fame lose her voyce; Er'e I will leaue my loue, or my loue you: Afflictions wounds affection doe renew. Hala. Perchance you loue both those I hate, and me; Affections then against affection be. Perchance a vow, good turnes, and good beleefe Are mists betweene your loue, and my releefe. Caine. You know I loue: speake plaine, and doe not feare, That reason other is than kindnesse there. Hala. Then heare: and if my iudgement you disproue, You shall haue cause to thinke I trust, and loue. Mahomet the faultie is, his faults be these: Enuious of thee, to my loue treacherous; The King must lose his sight, his Crowne, his Sonne: This wickednesse hath Mahomet begunne. Caine. O hell! and is thy seate in fleshly hearts? Be mans ill thoughts his owne ill spirits become? I well can thinke that Mahomet aspires; For loue of greatnesse may with goodnesse goe: But cannot thinke that he our death conspires. Perchance he seekes to doe your brother Right, Which makes our owne desires to doe vs spite. Hala. Mischiefe that may be help'd, is hard to know; And danger going on still multiplies. Caine. Let care as fast then adde vnto her eyes. Hala. Where harme hath many wings, care armes too late: Caine. Hastie attempts make chance precipitate. What shall I doe? Hal. Goe forward in thy feare: Danger doth giue thee choice to doe, or beare. Caine. My loue of him, and truth, doe make me loth To thinke them wrong'd: And shall I wrong them both? Hala. The good beleefe of mankinde is a sea Where honor drownes, iniquitie goes free; Whose thoughts (like sailes) for euery weather be. Caine. With shaking thoughts no hands can draw aright: True hearts, to doe vnnobly, haue no sp'rit. Hala. The feare of some, is guilt with honestie; Others, with loue; thine, with false noblenesse. Yet thinke not (Coward) wit can hide the shame Of hearts, which while they dare not strike for feare, Would make it vertue in them to forbeare. No Caine: In men we women, when we loue, Aske faith, and heart. Our selues haue feare, and wit. In loue how can thy soule, and mine agree? I seeke reuenge, thou preachest pietie. Caine. More easie motions gentle hearts receiue: His fault was great; yet you may haue redresse In State, and honor, without such excesse. Hala. Excesse the reason is, and meane of loue; And in the same excesse is malice ioy'd: I would be safe, and yet haue him destroy'd. Caine. If leaue, or left the fate of kindnesse be, By his example, what becomes of me? Hala. If blinde to all, but to it selfe, be loue; Whence doe your vowes, or whence this question moue? Since the true state of true affection is Wonder, at others worth; Faith, without hire; Vnwearied Paine; vnrecompens'd Desire. Caine. Great hearts thus giuen away, in prison are; Their strength, their bands; and good beleefe, their smart: Loue neuer seuers reason from the heart. Hala. My shame againe then unto me impart; Restore my faith; and I doe render thee Those faithlesse vowes, which thou hast made to me. For since, I see, the spungie hearts of men Their hollowes gladly fill with womens loue, And nothing yeeld to them vncrusht againe: What nature workes 'tis folly to complaine. Mahomet, that wretch, hath done me iniurie; He left my loue, and he my life hath sought: Caine! Line at ease; fame is an idle breath; My body is enough 'twixt thee, and death. Caine. Distract I am: my reason (like a cloud, Before a winters storme) rides here, and there: Like reedes, my thoughts are straight and crooked too; With diuers breaths, which diuers passions blow. Against the streame of truth must loue still goe? Resolv'd I am that Mahomet shall die. Hala. Shame spake this word: danger appeares not yet; Time, like a med'cine, will asswage this paine, And feare perchance bring backe good will againe. Caine. It is not I that liue in me, but you; Whose will hath fashion'd all my thoughts anew. Hala. Then on: When thoughts vnite all care is ceas'd; The heart, vnfetter'd and the hope increas'd. Out of his death I see occasion borne, To greater power than needs to couer scorne. For he the Iustice rules, you rule the Warre; His death diuided powers will vnite: And in a broken course where dangers be, Only the Crowne can put off miserie. Caine. Farre be it off, our hopes should be so vaine. Our secret loue already tempteth God, To warre him more with infidelity, Would hasten vengeance, and make sharpe his rod. Hala. God made strict lawes for vertues exercise, An idle word, a wish transgresseth them: Yet in a Throne remorse hath glorious eyes. Alaham doth vndermine the present State: When he corrupted hath the peoples faith, Thou hast the sword: authority makes way, Her hand is next when Crownes become a prey. Caine. We God and man will first trie with the death Of Mahomet: If that doe passe for good, Hope easily makes occasion vnderstood. Hala. The end agree'd, the meane is yet in doubt. Caine. By sword. Hala. That will be easie to descrie; Danger to misse; and hard to doe without. Caine. By poyson then; wherof though doubts may grow, What one alone may doe, is hard to know. Hala. It often failes: For instruments are base; Slaues haue too slauish hearts; a Basshas name Is like a superstitious hallowed place. Men must be forc'd, or wise that force the same. Caine. By these two hands, that will not faile their heart, It shall be wrought. If poyson misse, the sword shall compasse it: When chances often scape, at last they hit. Hala. Fortune, and Loue! Both Gods of humane might, You like aduenture, see it rightly plac'd: You liue in kindnesse, see it not disgrac'd. Exit. Caine. What I haue vow'd, both God, and Nature hate; My heart misgiues; my soule doth prophecie, That euill thoughts procure an euill fate. But ah! my loue I gaue, and it gaue me. The choice is past: Thoughts now must thinke to doe Not what I freely am, but forc'd vnto. Scena quarta. Mahomet; Caine. Mahomet. Who euer haue obseru'd the worke of spirits May see how easily men slide downe to ill. The world hath strange examples, false delights, Which make our senses nets to catch our will. Who then with men for euery fault falls out, Must hate himselfe, and all the world about. Behold! the man I speake of doth appeare: Retire aside, stand close, marke what succeeds: His owne destruction, or else mine he breeds. Caine! what is it, that thus your minde distracts? Counsells of honour alter not the face; Hearts only thinke with paine of doubtfull acts. Caine. In care they liue that must for many care; And such the best, and greatest euer are. Mah. They purchase care vnto themselues, that know The weight of care; and yet will it imbrace. If care be grieuous, why vsurpe you so? Caine. I liue but to obey the Princes will. Mahomet. That is, to cherish Prince in their ill: For they must flatter good, and euill too, That vnder Princes all alone will doe. Caine. As sweetest vapors couet to the skie: So faith, and dutie after Princes runne; Ill nature neuer can indure a Sunne. Mahomet. Flatterie so like in all to dutie showes, But finelier drest in diligence, and care, As Kings best plea'sd, that most deceiued, are. Caine. Harsh spirit hates them, that do not hate with it, Miscensures all the world to seeme seuere; Bindes honestie and truth to haue no wit; These ill-fac'd vertues not of nature be, But peeuishnesse, true honors enemie. Mahomet. A iust, seuere, and vniuersall care Of people, shorne by Princes fauorites, To spies of Tyrannie vnpleasing is; Which euer, like ambitious Adamants, So fast from people draw to Princes States, As in the end they must draw vp their hates. Caine! then take heed of your selfe-seeking plot, Engrossing offices, aspiring all; For it offends euen those it toucheth not. Nor is it only this that hazards you; Ill neuer goes alone, if fame say true. Caine. Is fame to censure vs that liue aboue, And must sell iustice, if we purchase loue? Mahomet. Fame is the peoples voyce, to tell their griefe, Appealing from inferiors to the chiefe. If falsely you, and Hala, fame abuse; Infamie for nothing men vnwisely chuse: If fame speake truth, which you would not haue knowne, Grieue to deserue, but not to beare your owne. Caine. What doe I, that the world can well reproue? Mahomet. Vniustly suffer, or vniustly loue. Caine. Suffer I doe; for infamie is there, Where either malice, enuie is, or feare. Loue I confesse I doe; And what is it, But natures taxe, layd vpon good intent, For right, and honor vnto excellent? Mahomet. Reason must iudge of loue, not loue of it; Else shall loue ground of euery mischiefe be: For murther, theft, adultery, and spite, Are but loue of reuenge, and others right. Ah Caine! my heart is rackt with inward griefe, Iustice hath partie there, and so hath loue: They both haue wounds, and yet they both haue life; The one suppressing what the other moues. I will speake plaine: Hala, thou do'st abuse, And stayn'st the Princes line with seruile lust: Wherin proud courage, match'd with guiltinesse, Adds wrong to wrong; and to or'e-build complaint, Affects that greatnesse which makes faults seeme lesse. Caine! weigh thy course: âAmbitions gilded spheres âAre like to painted hells, which please the eyes, âEuen while they shew the heart where horror lies. Her gilded Throne built on the ruine is Of Fame, of true Religion, and of Law: The labor's great that all the world must draw. The second place, which with this King you hold, Yeelds feare vnfearfull, greatnesse well secur'd: Who stand, or fall with Kings, stand well assur'd. Where men that wrongfully aspire a Crowne, While they looke vpward euer tumble downe. Besides, thy bloudy plots discouer'd be To worke my death; did not the Powers aboue Restraine both ill mens malice, and their loue. Caine. Let this beare witnesse: No false prophets know, The time, or manner of their ouerthrow. Mahomet. Nay let thy life, in his power thou wouldst kill, Proue, God giues seldome good successe to ill. Behold! Euen Natures iust accusing spies Now make thy face blush forth thy guiltinesse; Remorse begets strange contrarieties: Confusions warre of good, and ill, I see, At once contending for the victorie. But Caine! hold fast these sparks, they be of truth. These smokes will passe, and light appeare againe; Shame past, is honor; Error is vertues booke, Where knowledge doth aboue temptation looke: Caine. What vgly musicke inward discords make? Thoughts layd asleepe of long doe now appeare; Euen halfe my power coniures me for his sake. What's this? Me hinkes I feele my shame grow deare. Hate of my selfe, and desolation breed, Where ioy, and pleasure I was wont to feed. Mahomet. Who lose their euils, lose their owne despaire; Out of which losse new hopes of honor rise, To show the world desire with better eyes. Caine. What can I hope? My fruit of better wit Is but to know I fayl'd for lacke of it. Shame is in that I leaue, and that I doe: The fault is only mine; and onely I, A sacrifice vnto you all, will die. Mahomet. Fauour thy selfe: Passions are desperate, And tempt with vncouth woe, as well as ioy. It euill is that glories to destroy; Her, and her counsells kill, and I agree; For she is foe alike to thee, and me. Caine. That is destroy my selfe; and I consent: For all any thoughts to thee were euill bent. Mahomet. Caine! credit not those visions of the ill. Faults are in flesh, as motes be in the Sunne, Where light doth shew each little thing amisse. Presumption, and despaire liue opposite, As times false glasses, wherin frailties see, Their faults too great, or else too little be. But iudge the man from whom these motions grow. Alaham ambitious is, light, violent; His end but to surprise his fathers state: Vnto which end, no lets there are but we; Who wonne, remou'd, or ruined must be. He first tried me with riuall iealousie, Shewing me hope, and honour in the start: Besides reuenge, by thy death offering me, Of our diuided powers an vnitie. But I stood firme. While he no whit dismay'd, Tempts thee more strongly, whom he hateth more; Resolu'd who euer kills, shall killed be: So much the faithlesse ioy in cruelty. Caine. âMischiefe o'reflowes my thoughts; &amp; like a sea, âDeuoures the dewes, the raine, the snow, the springs, âAnd all their sweetnesse to his saltnesse brings. How should I ground a faith, that faithlesse know My selfe to be? Or why should he mistrust, On whom the worst that can befall is iust? Mahomet. Who liue distrusting, yet haue time to friend; But who mistrusting die, make haste to goe To that infernall Monarchie of feare, Where worse things come to passe, than doubted were. Caine. Mahomet! Thou hast o'recome: I yeeld, by thee To hold my life, as sentence of my fall; Thy worths example, no life naturall. Yet grant me thus-much more; to keepe thee close, Till I thy death to Alaham impart; Conceit it selfe doth ease a broken heart. Mahomet. Grant me againe, while secretly I liue, You guard your selfe from Alahams treacherie; Lest you haue harme; he, ioy; I, infamie. Exit. Caine. Behold my state! bound to my enemies; Of friends in doubt. To me euen good, and ill, The one despayre, the other cowardize. Hala I loue: O word beyond the right, On which is built that false thought, Libertie, Which makes great hearts in greatest ills delight. I sought her loue through all the arts of lust; Where will, is faith; and honour, Tyrannie; Mischiefe, affections proofe; and shame, her trust. Hard, backe from ill, the way to goodnesse is, By scorne, remorse, patience, and broken heart, Impossible to them that doe amisse. Then on: walke in this path of death, or shame; Alaham is false, or Mahomet, or I; Resolu'd I am, that one of vs shall die. CHORVS SECVNDVS, Of Furie: Malice. Crafte. Pride. Corrupt reason. Euill Spirit. Malice. Whence growes this fatall stay of our progression? Who haue no friends are deafe to intercession? What can withstand our power? Our ends are euill; And so need feare no let from any Diuell. Craft. We diuerse are in works, though not in ends; And thereby euery Furie findes some friends. Besides, we ouer-act, and therein foyle The ruine of Mankinde, wherein we toyle. Malice. Giue me one instance: wherein doe we fayle? Craft. In that we mankind vnto fame entayle. Malice. That breakes Religions bounds, and makes him ours, By forming his God out of his owne powers: For if by Conscience he did leaue, or take; On that smooth face we could no wrinckle make. Craft. Yet fame keepes outward order, and supports: For shame and honour are strong humane forts. Whereas Confusion is an engine fit For vs, at once to swallow man with it. Malice. Nay Craft! it is thy faint hypocrisie, That mankinde is so long protected by. Thy often changes many times appease Those Furies, which would else destroy at ease. Craft. Fye Malice! It is you that vs deceiue, Who but with violence only can bereaue. For which you finde not many natures fit, And so adde little to our Throne by it. Where I passe thorough all the orbes of vice, And forme in each mould Natures preiudice. The Christian Church from me is not exempt; Lawes haue by me both honour and contempt; By me the Warre vpholds her reputation; And lust, which leaues no certaine generation; Enuy, that hates all difference of degree; And selfe-loue, which hath no affinity; Euen you, without me, cannot prosper well: I am the mould, and Maiesty of hell. Pride. Craft, peace! thou cuttest euery threed so thin, As it destroyes thy works ere they beginne. Thy cobwebs, like th'Astrologers thinne line, Fit for discourse, for vse are ouer-fine. Thy state is nothing else but change and feare, Weeds that no fruit, but fading blossomes beare, Cloth'd with pied colours of hypocrisie, Which like to all is, yet can nothing be. In you no soule findes stayres to rise withall, Descent to craft, change, feare, being naturall. When I propound in grosse, you minutes play, Which is the cause our Tragicke works thus stay. My wheeles goe on at once, thine restlesse pause; Of little works, with much adoe, the cause. You euen in Hala sometimes breed remorse, At least a doubt that euill hath no force. Thou makest Caine in vndertaking slow, Who must, to serue thy turne, like goodnesse show: Those Scenes still tedious are, those Acts too long, Where thy vnresolute Images be strong. For while you feare your true tormentor, Shame, I swallow all at once, with honors name. Then glory not: since where thy links excell, There we inlarge not, but contract our hell. Corrupt reason. Peace you base Subalterns! and striue no more, That but the Carriers be of my rich store. Perchance you thinke me th'obiect of you all, And so no Furie, but the Furies thrall: Where I giue forme, and stuffe to make you worse, And so become your Lord, and not your Nurse. I breake the banks of dutie, honor, faith; And subiect am to no power, but to death: Charge me; I grant, Delayes grow out of wit: And are not all your false webs wrought by it? To time I haue respect, to person, place; I crosse my selfe to giue my owne acts grace. I am Base to you all, and so the chiefe, Equall with truth, where I finde good beleefe. I beare the weight of feare, the rage of lust, With selfe-loue, enuy, malice, left in trust. I calme Mans windy pride, distempered rage, Giuing to each a shape for euery age. Wrong I attire in purple robes of might, That State may helpe it to be infinite. And who is fitter here to rule you all, Than I, that giue you being, by my fall? Know therfore all you shadow-louing Spirits! Who haue no being, but in mans demerits, That infinite desires, and finite power, At once, can neuer all mankinde deuoure. Though men be all ours, and all we but one; The vice yet cannot build, or stand alone. Be it mans weaknesse that doth interrupt, Or some power else that cannot be corrupt; Or be there what there may be else aboue, Which may, and will maintaine her owne by loue: Yet haue we scope enough to marre this State; And to the euer being, what is late? As men in your names image vglinesse, To checke beloued childrens wantonnesse, When they would haue them doe things, or forbeare; And call you when they know you are not there: So I enammell your deformity, Making all your excesses like to me. And that you may beleeue this to be true; We are not like: For what am I, but you? Euill Spirits. Reason! You marre our Mart, by coueting Not to be equall with vs, but our King. For though you now like Romane Augurs be, Who, but your staffe, haue no true mysterie; Yet doe you striue to rule, adde, or diminish; And idly so protract what we could finish. Else how could Alaham, or Hala stay So long; from making to our ends a way? Lusts open face this Age will easily beare, And hope here currant is to all, but feare. Wrong needs no veile, where times doe tyrannize; And what, but lacke of heart, is then vnwise; Age hath descri'd those toyes to be but name, Which in the worlds youth did beare reall fame; Iustice, Religion, Honour, Humblenesse; Shaddowes, which not well mixt, make beauty lesse. They helpe to smother, not inlarge our fire, By putting painted maskes on mans desire; And giue time to vnactiue Theorie, Which rage it selfe would not doe, were it free. So that we, Circe-like, change men to beasts, Which beasts turne men againe: Too base a crest For vs, that would quite banish doing well; And so at once change heauen and earth, to hell. In which course, who doth well obserue each part, Shall finde mankinde to haue so strange a heart; As being all ill, yet no one ill serues To worke him to that mischiefe he deserues: Feare, hope, desire, loue, courage being mixt So nicely in him, as none can be fixt. Which is our glorie: as for euery state To haue a Tempter fitted, and a fate. A feare in Great men still, to lose their might; And in the meane, ambition infinite; Truth, in the witty held but as a notion; Honor, the Old mans God; the Youths promotion. All which opposing powers, yet doe agree To worke corruption in humanity. Then on: This time is ours: What need we haste? Since till time ends, our raigne is sure to last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus tertius Scena prima. ALAHAM alone. Alaham. I march aboue the wits, and hearts of men; Chance at my feet, and power in my hand. Now King indeed. Obedience doth become Men, that can strength by wisdome ouercome. It honour was, euen worthy more than Crownes, To passe the Basshas in aduenturing: They were possest, I dispossest of all, But liberty to liue, or dye a thrall. Truth was in vaine; no peecing vp with might For me I saw; I had too good a cause: Counsell is slow, each minute infinite, When resolution to her ripenesse drawes. I saw corruption was the way to rise, And with that shot I pierc'd their tyrannies. Their guard I did corrupt. Base seruile spirits, (I knew) lackt wit to see, or heart to beare Temptation: For desire is infinite In them, that wanting honour cannot feare. Triall is made: The King I doe possesse: My right is more; why should my hope be lesse? And am I King? And doe my foes still liue? Can wounded Greatnesse slumber in a Throne? Or that be glory which I feele alone? No, No: Let rigour speake, which all men heare: Life, is the worke of Nature; death, of Kings: Ruine it is, that reputation brings. My Guard is strong; their first imployment is The murther of those men my father trusts; Not all; for that were cruelty, not wit: Some simple being, some indifferent sp'rits: Their ends, and honours being but delights. Others ambitious, rash, and violent, No inward strength of nature: or of grace; Of present power the noblest instruments. Transforme, and vse: wit vertue doth exceed: For it is all, or none, as men haue need. Only my care is how the Plot should proue, Which for the Basshas now in ambush lies: My wife hath art and rage, which iointly moue Her head-strong spirits vnto cruelties. But if her craft serue not to plucke them downe, The sword wants not pretences for the Crowne. My friends, and Mates! (You! vpon whom I lay My life, and honour, with this State, in trust) Be resolute; For scruple doth betray; Since all great works haue great examples must. Take Assem, Zeraphus, and Velladoune: Blood asketh blood: with rauine they did spoyle The people first; and now betray the Crowne. Reuenge your parents, Countrey-men, and kin: Blood here is iust, true honor, and no sinne. The cancred Calchas, scourge of Tyrannies, Great master of deceipt, Artisan of spoyle, The spie of faults, and spring of subsidies; Naked deliuer him into the Sea, To plague those faults it cannot wash away. The rest to bonds, who though they want no spite, Their frailty yet for innocence shall stand. All else exile. Obey in euery thing: They happy are that serue a rising King. Scena secunda. Caine, Alaham. Caine. Plac'd in a Throne? Guarded? Ador'd? and Crownd? What meanes this change? These signes of Maiestie? Goodnesse gets not so soone a great Estate: Mischiefe's foule way to Soueraignity: This secret haste is sure: all is imbound. What shall I do? Hold on the course I meant? Why not? The death of Mahomet will still content. Thy will is done; and Mahomet is slaine. Alaham. My minde misgaue it selfe; my thoughts did feare; Yet knew I they of nothing guilty were. By fate, or malice is the Bassha slaine? Caine. By fate I thinke: for Iustice fatall is, As Gods bequest to them that doe amisse. Alaham. By suddaine death, by thunder, lightning, fire, Or by what other anger of the skie? I pray thee shew how Mahomet did die. Caine. By these hands that owe seruice to the State, And by his blood haue made it fortunate. Alaham. What execration did he dying vse Against this violence of broken faith; Which wounds good soules more than the bodies death? Caine. In falling downe, these only words he spake: âHelpe people! helpe: My death your bondage brings: âBehold! these wounds receiue I for your sake; âReward of them that friend you vnder Kings. âVile Caine! that (like the Axe) do'st goe about, âTo cut thy selfe an helue to weare thee out. Alaham. Most wicked act! Could neither faith, nor law, Reuerence of State, remorse of doing ill, The paines of iustice, nor the hopes withdraw Thy raging hand? And do'st thou thinke the world can suffer this; That thou should'st glory to haue done amisse? Caine. Is thy desire growne wanton in her ioy? Or do'st thou seeme to say thy wishes nay, More kindly in the end with them to play? Alaham. By fires of hell, which burne, and haue no light; By those foule spirits which ill men only see; I sweare thy death shall Mahomets requite. Caine. Vnto the world although I guilty be; I did thy will: let me be cleare to thee. Alaham. In vaine I should command his death by sleights, That placed am vpon the fathers seat, Where power can easlier doe things, than intreat. Caine. The State of Kings is large; yet lacks in this, That easie each thing, but not lawfull is. Besides, you then a second brother were; Nor knew I, when this plot we did deuise, You should see clearer by your fathers eyes. Alaham. Rumor, complaints, and scornfull thoughts of power, Are wayes of priuate hearts, that from below Misiudge those higher powers, they doe not know. But now borne vp into a Princes Throne, Beneath I see that world of discontent, Where error teacheth vse of punishment. Away with him. Entreatie is in vaine: Thy death to him is due, whom thou hast slaine. Caine. âAh fearefull friendships with superior powers! âWhose two parts, they themselues, and their Estates, âDiuide, or ioyne like nets; and be the snare, âWhere loue, and feare to power entrapped are. Alaham! aduow thy deed. To constant wickednesse men honour beare, Where truth it selfe hath iniurie by feare. Alaham. I say; Let him be slaine. His fault is this, That Mahomet most trayterously he slew. Caine. Stay Sir! I say that he still liuing is, And my confession of my selfe vntrue. Alaham. Traytor vnto thy selfe! and false to me! What riddles of contempt, and wicke nesse Are these, which of thy selfe confessed be? If Mahomet be dead; then shalt thou die: For murther of thy friend deserues no lesse. If Mahomet do liue; yet shalt thou die: For if no murther, scorne thou do'st confesse. Away with him. Scena tertia. Hala. Alaham. Hala. What tumult's this my Lord? Alah. The play of Chance, Which without mischiefe nothing can aduance. Hala. Yet good Sir! tell me what this tumult is. Alaham. The fall of him whose heart hath done amisse. Hala. His name, and crime (sweet Lord) I long to know. Alaham. Report of mischiefe doth infect the heart, And wisdome bids they should in silence goe; For nature feeleth euery bodies smart. Hala. Women, belike, are still in infancy. That must not feare, or prouocation see. The glasse of horror is not fact, but feare: Opinion is a Tyrant euery where. Alaham. If I shall tell you what you long to know, What boots it? If you thinke it is not so. Hala. What leades your reason, leades my reason too, That all your words conceiue in kindnesse doe. Alaham. The man that was, and is not now, is he That neuer was the man he seem'd to be. Caine: What need more to shew? with him are dead His fault, and our goodwills to him mislead. Hala. What heare I now? O false and weake estate Of good beleefe! Wherin shall peace be found? Since Gods be not, and mankinde made to hate. Caine dead? Euen Caine, whom now we loued best, In instants both growne wicked, and opprest? Caine slaine by you! Hath Caine deserued this? O God! Like strange his crime, and killing is. Perchance not dead my Lord! how was he slaine? Alaham. By sword. Hala. Wounds let forth spirits, yet liue againe. Alaham. Nay, dead he is. These eyes did see his breath Beare all his spirits into the world of death. Hala. Necessity, that from infernall night Fatally linked art vnto the skies! Beare thee we cannot, yet we beare thee must. Now hopes appeare: euen now my heart resolues Reuenge; and silence is the way to it. Did he confesse his fault? What spake he last? Alaham. Ah Mahomet! whose hopes were on me plac'd. Hala. Hasty beleefe (my Lord) hath hasty deeds, And with their wounds, oft truth, and wisdome bleeds. Alaham. When wickednesse is ripe, a minute showes What chance the dice of Innocency throwes. Hala. Pardon me Lord! Good thoughts doe liue aboue; In highest region of vnfeined loue: Doubt and reuenge, Nature hath plac'd below Meaning the space should make the passage slow. Alaham. God, meaning we should rule, and you obey, Gaue men cleare sight, and women good affection: In vs, not in your selues, lies your election. Hala. My Lord! 'Tis true: Our frayle, and weake Estate Doth labor in excesse: A womans heart Still in the feuer is of loue, or hate. Hardly the loue which I did beare to Caine, Could thinke he err'd; much lesse approue him slaine. But now his falls approu'd by heauenly doome, Our losse in him foretells our gaine to come. Then Sir! Take care his death be not in vaine. Your sillie Sire is blinde; if he were dead, This reeling State by you might stand againe: True ioy is onely hope put out of feare, And honour hideth error euery where. A forme the world expects in worldly things: Caine was a man, a Bassha, and our friend; Sepulture, as a man; honor, to his estate; Teares doe become a guilty friendships end: Excesse of honour, done to them that die, Makes liuing men see our humanity. Besides, thought-feeding rumor forth will goe, And occupie vnquiet peoples spirits, While in this pile for Caine you may bestow Their blinded weaknesse, which with-hold your right. People doe power, not persons apprehend; Strength showes like truth; Mankinde loues policie: Defended Kings, but not reuenged be. Alaham. Enuy will rise, and both wayes fall on vs; Either as hauing slaine an innocent, Or highly err'd by burying treason thus. In penall iustice silence best contents. Hala. Rumor must needs be borne of doing mindes: Enuy is but the smoke of low estate, Ascending still against the fortunate. Alaham. I feare the cariage: it hath many parts. And Hazards courses may finde ouerthwarts. Hala. My shame is equally engag'd with yours. Intents ill carried are that men may know; When things are done, let rumor freely goe. Alaham. Great works doe oft yeeld grieuous accidents, Which stirre vp peoples rage beyond intents. Hala. People are superstitious, caught with showes: To power why doe they else their freedome giue, But that in others pompe these shadowes liue? Alaham. O blessed yoke! that vnder reason drawes The pleasant load of well-vnited loue: Thy counsell (as mine owne) I doe approue. Hala. Then send the Priest. To me bequeath the rest. For superstition hides ill meaning best. Scena Quarta. Hala: Nutrix. Hala. And is he gone? Rage then vnprisoned be! I like thee well! While Alaham was there, Thou then didst vse thy violence on me. Now prey abroad; swell aboue all respect; Feare nothing, if notorious thou wilt raigne: Thy glories shine, when euery one complaine. What now? A child? And do'st thou idly walke The beaten pathes of common cruelty? A iudge, and no reuenger then am I, If thou no more than his offences be. While Caine did liue thou thought'st of more than this: Shall death, desire, hope, fame, and fortunes lost Such fading Trophies haue? Can thankfulnesse abound? And shall offense Not feele, Reuenge hath her magnificence? Rage! now thou art aboue the Orbe of doubt, Where danger dangerlesse appeares to thee; Diuine (I pray thee) what shall fall to me? Must I be slaine? Nutrix. Monstrous I know, this womans nature is. The worst she still; her selfe she now exceeds, That dares scarce trust her selfe with that she breeds. Hala. Well! now I feele thee rise, when I admire: When hills haue clouds, let all the vallies feare. Scorn'st thou to make examples out of him? Hast thou found out his children? They are mine, Proud horrour! Do'st thou chuse the innocent? False conqueror of nature! do'st thou moue A womans spite to spoyle a mothers loue? Rage! shall we striue which shall giue other place? Nutrix. Hala! suppresse; you need not kindle Rage. Hala. Well! On. So that (like ruine) I may fall, And ruine him; take children, me, and all. Nutrix. Hala! distract? haue senses lost their vse? Hala. Is there a third that traffiketh abuse? Nutrix. I bring you pietie, dutie, reason, loue, Water, to quench these flames that passions moue. Hala. Throw on enough. No Sea can quench this flame; And then, what cannot quench doth but inflame. Nutrix. For whom doe you this sumptuous storme prepare? Hala. For whom are wiues estates inioyn'd to care? Nutrix. Is malice currant where respect is due? Hala. Power doth what likes in her inferiors moue; As we are sess'd, so pay we; hate, or loue. Nutrix. What fault in him mou'd these effects in you? Hala. Thoughts are too strict, much lesse can words containe; The venome of his malice is too deepe For any power, but Reuenge to keepe. Nutrix. Then Rage is lost: For there is nought in man, That equall paine with such offenses can. Hala. Be that the gage. Mans senses barren were, If they could apprehend, but what they feele. Ills doe with place (like Numbers) multiply: The liuing, dead, malice, affection, feare, My wombe, and I doe his affliction beare. Nutrix. Will you destroy your owne? Hala. My owne are his. Nutrix. Infamous act! Hala. Rage doth but now begin. Nutrix. Canst thou doe worse? Hala. Else to my selfe I sinne Life is too short; horrour exceeds not faith, That cannot plague offences after death. Nutrix. Ah! Calme this storme; these vgly torrents shunne. Of Rage, which drowne thy selfe, and all besides. Hala. Furies! no more irregularly runne, But arted: Teach confusion to diuide. Nutrix. If kinde be disinherited in thee, Yet haue compassion of this Orphane State. Hala. That is the worke, which men shall wonder at: For while his ruin'd are, yet mine shall raigne; His heires, but yet true issue vnto Caine. Nutrix. These works on Princes ruines must be built. Hala. For my reuenge no baser blood is spilt. Nutrix. What force can Princes forces ouer-beare? Hala. That force, which makes their pride it cannot feare. Nutrix. How enters malice where there is mistrust? Hala. With tribute into State: to Kings with lust. Nutrix. What way to these? Hala. Prosperity, successe. Nutrix. These adde more power: Hala. So much suspect the lesse. Nutrix. What can you adde? Hala. Presents, obedience, praise: They need not knocke to enter in that please. Nutrix. Flatteries are plaine. Hala. To Kings that see their ill. Nut. Kings iealous are. Hala. Of truth, not of their will. Nutrix. Vsurpers feare. Hala. Worth, not humilitie. Kings errors are our Agents in their hearts; Their priuate passions wound their publike States; Time hath her arguments, and place her Arts. This day he doth consummate all his ioy: Glory now at the Full is not suspitious; And what addes to his pompe shall him destroy. A Crowne, and Mantle of most curious worke I haue prepar'd, euen with Egyptian skill; And poyson him in pleasing him I will. Nutrix. My spirits fayle. Hala. Till Alahams ills doe tremble, Horrour is faint; Rage doth but Rage resemble. Depart; keep secret, and be not dismayd: Vnperfect works cannot their glories show; This goodly World did from a Chaos grow. Exit. Nutrix. Now Caine! For whose reuenge I only liue, Inspire thy ghost, to multiply in me More sense, to make my senses more enrag'd; More loue, to make loues losses more in thee; Double my wit beyond my strength engag'd; Open all lights of possibility; Let griefe, which yet keepes companie with death, Breake forth, and poyson all things with her breath. Scena quinta. Priest. Hala. Priest. Madame! whom men obey, and God doth heare: What zeale, remorse, or charity doth moue Your heart? The King leaues all things to your loue. Hala. Caine, who of late did liue to both vs deare, 'Tis true, did fayle; and for his fault is slaine: Our hearts are eas'd, as hauing lost their feare, The rites of humane duties yet remaine: A Kings belou'd he was; sometimes our friend; Which must appeare in honour of his end. Such royall Piles, as for the Princely race Are made a sacrifice vnto the skie, In honor of that God, which gaue them place: Such sumptuous Piles make: But more cost bestow; Because both iust Reuenge, and Loue they show. Summon the Mufti, and Soothsayers all, The Persian Magi, Christian Starre-Diuines, The first, to sing alike his faith, and fall; The last, to tell how higher power inclines. In short; Reuenge, and Loue shine in those fires; Powre on all pompe that magnifies desires: As if at once by crosse mortality, The Prince, and Princely line were dead in one; Let mourning and deuotion to the skie Be offred vp in pompe, and publike mone. Magnificence is Princely mystery; All great Estates by great expence are knowne. Prepare excesse: Let no cost be forgot; It makes men wonder, though they honour not. Musicke to fix the wandring spirits race, And sweeten Enuies thoughts in vnity; That sorrow and deuotion may haue place, Remorse and pittie flow, and multiply. Lights of all kindes the light of day shut out; For darknesse so enammeld is deuout. Exit. Priest. Vnhappy state of Priesthood here below, Who haue to doe with curious Atheisme, With sinne in flesh, and in the Church with schisme. Our office is an holy mystery, To teach Kings, God; and euery Subiect, King; How one obedience doth another bring. But what boots truth to flesh, or lawes to might? Beleefe a wonder is, Obedience woe. And shall we Priests, that vnder Princes liue, Striue in our selues with vice, abroad with might? And like the hands which winnow rich mens gaine, Grow poore in all, but only woe, and paine? No, No: The eyes of Priests looke euer low, To finde the key of power, that is aboue; When that is found, all faults beneath we know; But Maiesty hides faults, as well as loue. And though these rites of Princely funerall, By lawes diuine, should not prophaned be, With lesse, than with descents of Maiesty; Yet Caine! more Princely, by thy Princes grace, Shall be thy tombe, than euer Princes was. CHORVS TERTIVS; A Dialogue; of Good, and Euill Spirits. The Good. What is your scope vaine Ghosts? would you o'rebuild the skie? Were not mens Many tongues, and minds their Babel-destinie? Your beings discords are; and what can they create, But disproportion, which is still the fairest marke of fate? The Ill. Are you afrayd poore Soules? Else why doe you descend To question, or conferre with vs, to whom you are no friends? Who feare their owne Estates doe commonly first speake, As they againe put goodnesse on, who find their party weake. We doe but what we did, which is increase our might; And as on earth, so in the ayre; cry downe your borrowed light. The Good. What can you winne of vs, that must be as we were? Whereas you, exiles out of heauen, can hope for nothing there. The Ill. We, that were as you are, know well what you can be; Where you, that neuer were like vs, what can you in vs see? The Good. That you haue first destroyed your selues, and are ordain'd To scourge, curse, and corrupt that earth, which you boast to haue gain'd. The Ill. Why did not you defend that which was once your owne? Betweene vs two, the odds of worth, by odds of power is knowne. Besides, Mappe clearly out your infinite extent, Euen in the infancy of time, when much was innocent; Could this world then yeeld ought to enuie, or desire, Where pride of courage made men fall, and basenesse rais'd them higher? Where they that would be great, to be so, must be least? And where to beare, and suffer wrong, was vertues natiue crest? Mans skinne, was then his silke; the worlds wild fruit, his food; His wisdome, poore simplicity; his Trophies inward good. No Maiesty, for power; nor glories, for mans worth; Nor any end, but (as the plants) to bring each other forth. Temples, and vessells fit for outward sacrifice, As they came in, so go they out, with that which you count Vice. The Priesthood few, and poore; No Throne, but open ayre: For that which you call good, allowes of nothing that is faire. No Pyramis rais'd vp aboue the force of Thunder, Nor Babel-walles by Greatnesse built, for Littlenesse a wonder. No Conquest testifying wit, with courage mixt; As wheeles whereon the world must runne, and neuer can be fixt. No Arts, or Characters to read the great God in; Nor stories of acts done; for these all entred with the sinne. A lasy calme, wherein each foole a pilot is: The glory of the skilfull shines, where men may go amisse. Till we came in, there was no triall of your might, And since we were; in men, your selues presume of little right. Then cease to blast the earth with your abstracted dreames And striue no more to carry men against affections streames. Nay rather tempt, and proue, if long life make them wise, That must, to haue their beauties seene, put out all fleshly eyes. Or when they be no more, Eternall then to be, Neglect the ioy, and glorious vse of times felicity. Cast out these thinne-weau'd lines, and catch some little flyes; The greater spirits, which are ours, feele not these nimble tyes. In Alaham for instance, plead your power, or right; Entise him from a mortall Crowne, with your Crowne infinite. Proue if he will forbeare vnnaturall Parricide, To see who in the sea of humors shall the Scepter guide. Trie if proud Hala will forget the death of Caine, And reconcil'd, in dutie, with her owne Lord liue, and raigne. Moue Celica, that spirit reputed for your owne, To see if she, to saue her life, would haue her fame vnknowne. Worke Zophi (that poore soule) though blinde, to leaue his breath: We only make things cheape, or deare, as Lords of life, and death. Lastly, perswade the King to liue, and saue his Crowne; And all the world shall see we rayse, and wee pull Princes downe. So that your beings here are but a tincture cast (Like crests vpon the Egypt Pharos) to disguise, not last. Besides; take from the world that which you reckon Sinne; And she must be, as at the first, for euer to beginne. A glorious, spacious wombe fram'd to containe but one; Since he, that in it will be yours, is sure to be alone. Keepe therefore where you are; descend not, but ascend: For, vnderneath the Sun, be sure no braue State is your friend. The Good. What haue you wonne by this, but that curst vnder Sinne, You make, and marre; throw downe, and raise; as euer to beginne? Like Meteors in the ayre, you blaze but to burne out, And change your shapes (like Phantom'd clouds) to leaue weake eyes in doubt. Not truth, but truth-like grounds is that you worke vpon, Varying in all but this, that you can neuer long be one, Then play here with your art; false miracles deuise; Deceiue, and be deceiued still; be foolish, and seeme wise, In peace erect your Thrones; your delicacie spread, The flowers of time corrupt soone spring, and are as quickly dead. Let warre, which (tempest-like) all with it selfe o're-throwes, Make of this diuerse world a stage for blood-enammeld showes. Successiuely both these yet this fate follow will, That all their glories be no more than change from ill, to ill. So as with peace, or warre, if you adorne one realme, In both, through other Climes againe, you runne with barren streame. Rest no where therefore, but still wander, as you doe, And restlesse be they, as you are, that shall receiue you too. Giue Alaham more scope to multiply his error, With parents blood adorne his Throne; more guilt still adds more terrour. Let Hala's wicked heart (for all ill births a wombe) By violence of passion, make for many vices roome. Let ill example in to staine the Christian Nation; The same excesse destroyes at last, which first gaue reputation. Conspire against the truth, you haue an easie foe: For in the world all that are hers can neuer currant goe. Vnder the next good, shaddow your deform'd excesse; Yet shall your masked arts, and hornes, your clouen feet expresse. Wherby your beauties be so priz'd among your owne; As they will blush for yours, by name, or nature to be knowne. Againe, take all the world, if it one soule content; Then freely let Mankinde beleeue you are omnipotent. But if your Legions here doe in their glories raue, Tormented while they liue on earth, and much more in the graue; If to be nothing be the best that could befall; Your subtile Orbes, to reall beings, then must needs be thrall. And so proue to the good but like those showres of raine, Which, while they wet the husbandman, yet multiply his gaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus quartus Scena prima. King. Celica. King. Celica! thou only child, whom I repent Not yet to haue begot! thy worke is vaine: Thou run'st against my Destinies intent. Feare not my fall; the steepe is fayrest plaine, And error safest guide vnto his end, Who nothing but mischance can haue to friend. We parents are but Natures nursery, When our succession springs then ripe to fall; Priuation vnto age is naturall. Age there is also in a Princes State, Which is contempt, growne of misgouernment; Where loue of change begetteth Princes hate: For hopes must wither, or grow violent, If fortune binde desires to one Estate. Then marke: Blinde, as a Man: Scorn'd, as a King: A Fathers kindnesse loath'd, and desolate: Life without ioy, or light: what can it bring, But inward horrour vnto outward hate? O safety! thou art then a hatefull thing, When childrens death assures the fathers State. No; Safe I am not, though my sonne were slaine, My frailty would beget such sonnes againe. Besides, if fatall be the heauens will, Repining adds more force to destinie, Whose iron wheeles stay not on fleshly wit, But headlong runne downe steep Necessity. And as in danger, we doe catch at it That comes to helpe; and vnaduisedly Oft doe our friends to our misfortune knit: So with the harme of those who would vs good, Is Destinie impossibly withstood. Celica then cease; importune me no more: My sonne, my age, the state where things are now Require my death. Who would consent to liue, Where loue cannot reuenge, nor truth forgiue? Celica. Though feare see nothing but extremity, Yet danger is no deep sea, but a Ford, Where they that yeeld can only drowned be. In wrongs, and wounds, Sir, you are to remisse. To Thrones a passiue nature fatall is. King. Occasion to my sonne hath turn'd her face; My inward wants all outward strengths betray; And so make that impossible I may. Celica. Yet liue: Liue for the State. King. Whose ruines glasses are, Wherin see errors of my selfe I must, And hold my life of danger, shame, and care. Celica. When feare propounds, with losse men euer choose. King. Nothing is left me, but my selfe, to lose. Celica. And is it nothing then to lose the State? King. Where chance is ripe, there counsell comes too late: Celica! by all thou ow'st the Gods, and me, I doe coniure thee; Leaue me to my chance. What's past was errors way; the truth it is, Wherein I wretch can only goe amisse. âIf Nature saw no cause of suddaine ends, âShe; that but one way made to draw our breath, âWould not haue left so many doores to death. Celica. Yet Sir! if weaknesse be not such a sande, As neither wrong, nor counsell can manure; Choose, and resolue what death you will endure. King. This sword, thy hands, may offer vp my breath, And plague my lifes remissenesse in my death. Celica. Vnto that dutie if these hands be borne, I must thinke God, and Truth, but names of scorne. Againe, this iustice were, if life were lou'd; Now meerly grace; since death doth, but forgiue A life to you, which is a death to liue. Paine must displease that satisfies offence. King. Chance hath left death no more to spoile, but sense. Celica. Then sword! doe Iustice office thorough me; I offer more than that he hates to thee. King. Ah! Stay thy hand. My State no equall hath, And much more matchlesse my strange vices be: One kinde of death becomes not thee, and me. Kings plagues by chance, or destinie should fall; Headlong he perish must that ruines all. Celica. No cliffe, or rocke is so precipitate, But downe it eyes can leade the blinde a way; Without me liue, or with me dye you may. King. Celica! and wilt thou Alaham exceed? His crueltie is death, you torments vse; He takes my Crowne, you take my selfe from me; A Prince of this falne Empire let me be. Celica. Then be a King, no Tyrant of thy selfe: Be; and be what you will: what nature lent Is still in hers, and not our gouernment. King. If disobedience, and obedience both Still doe me hurt; in what strange state am I? But hold thy course: It well becomes my blood, To doe their parents mischiefe with their good. Celica. Yet Sir! harke to the poore oppressed teares, The iust mens moane, that suffer by your fall; A Princes charge is to protect them all. And shall it nothing be that I am yours? The world without, my heart within doth know, I neuer had vnkinde, vnreuerent powers. If thus you yeeld to Alahams treacherie; He ruines you; 'tis you, Sir, ruine me. King. Celica! Call vp the dead; awake the blinde; Turne backe the time; bid windes tell whence they come; As vainly strength speakes to a broken minde. Fly from me Celica! hate all I doe: Misfortunes haue in blood successions too. Celica. Will you doe that which Alaham can not? He hath no good: you haue no ill, but he: This Marre-right yeelding's honors Tyranny. King. Haue I not done amisse? Am I not ill, That ruin'd haue a Kings authority? And not one King alone; since Princes all Feele part of those scornes, wherby one doth fall. Treason against me cannot treason be: All lawes haue lost authority in me. Celica. âThe lawes of power chain'd to mens humors be. âThe good haue conscience; the ill (like instruments) âAre, in the hands of wise authority, âMoued, diuided, vsed, or layd downe; âStill, with desire, kept subiect to a Crowne. âStirre vp all States, all spirits: hope, and feare; Wrong, and reuenge, are currant euery where. King. Put downe my sonne: For that must be the way; A fathers shame, a Princes Tyrannie: The Scepter euer shall misiudged be. Celica. Let them feare rumor that doe worke amisse; Blood, torments, death, horrors of Cruelty, Haue time, and place. Looke through these skinnes of feare, Which still perswade the better side to beare. And since thy sonne thus trayterously conspires, Let him not prey on all thy race, and thee: Keepe ill example from posterity. King. Danger is come: and must I now vnarme? And let in hope to weaken resolution? Passion! be thou my Legacie, and Will; To thee I giue my life, Crowne, reputation; My pompes to clouds; and (as forlorne with men) My strength to women; hoping this alone, Though fear'd, sought, and a King, to liue vnknowne. Celica! all these to thee: doe thou bestow This liuing darknesse, wherein I doe goe. Celica. My soule now ioyes. Doing breathes horrour out. Absence must be our first sleppe: Let vs fly: A pawse in rage makes Alaham to doubt; Which doubt may stirre in people hope, and feare, With loue, or hate, to seeke you euery where. For Princes liues are fortunes miserie; âAs dainty sparks, which till men dead doe know, âTo kindle for himselfe each man doth blow. But harke! What's this? Malice doth neuer sleepe: I heare the Spies of power drawing neere. Sir! follow me: Misfortunes worst is come; Her strength is change; and change yeelds better doome. Choice now is past. Hard by there is a pile Built, vnder colour of a sacrifice; If God doe grant, it is a place to saue; If God denies, it is a ready graue. Scena secunda. Zophi. Celica. Zophi. Where am I now? All things are silent here. What shall I doe? Goe on from place, to place, Not knowing what to trust, or whom to feare? Yet what should I not feare, that liue to know Rights, Kingdomes, parents, all, my ouerthrow? Are these the specious hopes of Princes heires; Is Right still subiect to aspiring wit? Haue they that stand by Princes, more despaires, Than they that doe supplant annoynted heires! Is expectation nothing else in me, But woes fore-runner, to make deepe impression, By these surprises, of aduersity? Are these the glorious triumphs of this day? Absent, in presence; banisht, in recalling; A Throne, a tombe; a Prince become a prey. Ah cruell, false, ambitious thirst of State! Bloody-like rage! but more reuengefull still, Because their ends doe more inflame their will. My rights, and hopes I giue, and doe forgiue: Wrong! take the world, let me enioy my selfe. Scorn'd, blind, I cannot harme. Ah! let me liue. Let power despise My needlesse, guiltlesse blood. The strength of feare The losse of all things, but of life, can beare. Celica. What see I here! More spectacles of woe? And are my kinred only made to be Agents, and Patients in iniquity? Ah forlorne wretch! ruines example right! Lost to thy selfe, not to thy enemie, Whose hand, euen while thou fliest, thou fal'st into; And with thy fall, thy father do'st vndoe. Saue one I may: Nature would saue them both; But Chance hath many wheeles; Rage many eyes. What shall I then abandon innocents? Not helpe a helplesse brother throwne on me? Is nature narrow to aduersity? No, No. Our God left duty for a law; Pittie, at large; Loue, in authority; Despaire, in bonds; feare, of it selfe in awe: That rage of time, and powers strange liberty, Oppressing good men might resistance finde: Nor can I to a brother be lesse kinde. Do'st thou, that canst not see, hope to escape? Disgrace, can haue no friend; contempt, no guide; Right, is thy guilt; thy Iudge, iniquity; Which desolation casts on them that see. Zophi. Make calme thy rage: pittie a ghost distrest: My right, my liberty, I freely giue: Giue him, that neuer harm'd thee, leaue to liue. Celica. Nay; God, the World, thy Parents it denie; A brothers iealous heart, vsurped might Growes friends with all the world, except thy right. Zophi. Secure thy selfe. Exile me from this coast: My fault, suspition is; my Iudge, is feare; Occasion, with my selfe, away I beare. Celica. Fly vnto God: For in humanity Hope there is none. Reach me thy fearfull hand: I am thy sister; neither fiend, nor spie Of Tyrants rage; but one that feeles despaire Of thy Estate, which thou do'st only feare. Kneele downe; embrace this holy mystery, A refuge to the worst for rape, and blood; And yet, I feare, not hallowed for the good. Zophi. Helpe God! defend thine Altar! since thy might, In earth, leaues Innocence no other right. Celica. Eternall God! that seest thy selfe in vs! If vowes be more than sacrifice of lust, Rays'd from the smokes of hope, and feare in vs; Protect this innocent; calme Alahams rage; By miracles faith goes from age, to age. Affection trembles; reason is opprest; Nature, methinkes, doth her owne entrayles teare: In resolution ominous is feare. Scena tertia. Alaham. Celica. Alaham. Sirs! seeke the City, examine, torture, racke: Sanctuaries none let there be: make darknesse knowne: Pull downe the roofes, digge, burne, put all to wracke: And let the guiltlesse for the guilty grone. Change, shame, misfortune in their scaping, lie; And in their finding our prosperity. Good fortune Welcome! we haue lost our care, And found our losse: Celica distract I see; The King is neere: She is her fathers eyes. Behold! the forlorne wretch, halfe of my feare, Takes Sanctuary at holy Altars feet: Lead him apart, examine, force, and try; These binde the subiect, not the Monarchy. Celica! awake: that God of whom you craue Is deafe, and only giues men what they haue. Celica. Ah cruell wretch! guilty of parents blood! Might I, poore innocent, my father free, My murther yet were lesse impiety. But on; deuoure: feare only to be good: Let vs not scape: thy glory then doth rise, When thou at once thy house do'st sacrifice. Alaham. Tell me where thy Father is. Celic. O bloody scorne? Must he be kill'd againe that gaue thee breath? Is duty nothing else in thee but death? Alaham. Leaue off this maske; deceipt is neuer wise; Though he be blind, a King hath many eyes Celica. O two fold scorne. God be reueng'd for me. Yet since my Father is destroy'd by thee, Adde still more scorne, it sorrow multiplies. Alaham. Passions are learn'd, not borne within the heart, That method keepe: Order is quiets art. Tell where he is: For looke what loue conceales, Paine out of Natures Labyrinths reueales. Celica. This is reward which thou do'st threaten me: If terrour thou wilt threaten, promise ioyes. Alah. Smart cooles these boyling stiles of vanity. Celica. And if my Father I no more shall see, Helpe me vnto the place where he remaines; To hell below, or to the skie aboue: The way is easie, where the guide is loue. Alah. Confesse: where is he hid? Celica. Racke not my woe. Thy glorious pride of this vnglorious deed Doth mischiefe, ripe; and therefore falling, show. Alah. Bodies haue place, and blindnesse must be led: Graues be the Thrones of Kings, when they be dead. Celica. He was (Vnhappy) cause that thou art now; Thou art, ah wicked! cause that he is not; And fear'st thou Parricide can be forgot? Beare witnesse, Thou Almighty God on high! And you blacke Powers inhabiting below! That for his life my selfe would yeeld to die. Alah. Well Sirs! Goe seeke the darke, and secret caues, The holy Temples, sanctified Cells, All parts wherein a liuing corps may dwell. Celica. Seeke him amongst the dead, you plac'd him there: Yet lose no paines, good Soules! goe not to hell; And, but to heauen, you may goe euery where. Guilty, with you, of his blood let me be, If any more I of my Father know, Than that he is where you would haue him goe. Alah. Teare vp the vaults: behold her agonies! âSorrow substracts, and multiplies the spirits; âCare, and desire doe vnder anguish cease! âDoubt curious is, affecting piety; âWoe, loues it selfe; feare from it selfe would flie. Doe not these trembling motions witnesse beare, That all these protestations be of feare? Celica. If ought be quicke in me, moue it with scorne: Nothing can come amisse to thoughts forlorne. Alah. Confesse in time. Reuenge is mercilesse. Celica. Reward, and paine; feare, and desire too, Are vaine, in things impossible to doe. Alah. Tell yet where thou thy Father last didst see. Celica. Euen where he by his losse of eyes hath wonne, That he no more shall see his monstrous Sonne. First, in perpetuall night thou mad'st him goe; His flesh the graue, his life the stage, where sense Playes all the Tragedies of paine, and woe. And wouldst thou trayterosly thy selfe exceed, By seeking thus to make his Ghost to bleed? Alah. Beare her away: deuise; adde to the racke Torments, that both call death, and turne it backe. Celica. The flattering glasse of Power is others paine. Perfect thy worke; that heauen, and hell may know, To worse I cannot, going from thee, goe. âEternall life, that euer liu'st aboue! âIf sense there be with thee of hate, or loue; âReuenge my King, and Fathers ouerthrow. âO Father! if that name reach vp so high, âAnd be more than a proper word of Art, âTo teach respects in our humanity; âAccept these paines, wherof you feele no smart. Scena Quarta. King. Alaham. King. What sound is this of Celica's distresse? Alaham! wrong not a silly sisters faith. 'Tis plague enough that she is innocent; My child, thy sister; borne (by thee, and me) With shame, and sinne to haue affinity. Breake me; I am the prison of thy thought: Crownes deare enough, with fathers blood, are bought. Alah. Now feele thou shalt, thou ghost vnnaturall! Those wounds which thou to my heart then didst giue, When, in despite of God, this State, and me, Thou did'st from death mine elder brother free. The smart of Kings oppression doth not die: Time, rusteth malice; rust, wounds cruelly. King. Flatter thy wickednesse; adorne thy rage; To weare a Crowne teare vp thy Fathers age. Kill not thy sister: It is lacke of wit, To doe an ill that brings no good with it. Alah. Goe, lead them hence. Prepare the funerall; Hasten the sacrifice, and pompe of woe. Where she did hide him, thither let them goe. King. âO God! who mad'st those lawes which this Wretch breaks, âLet parents blood this curse vpon him bring; âThat he, who of a child breakes all respect, âMay, in his children, finde the same neglect. CHORVS QVARTVS, of People. Like as strong windes doe worke vpon the Sea, Stirring, and tossing waues to warre each other: So Princes doe with Peoples humors play, As if Confusion were the Scepters mother. But Crownes! take heed: when humble things mount high, The windes oft calme before those billowes lie. When we are all wrong'd, had we all one minde, Whom could you punish? what could you reserue? Againe, as hope, and feare distract mankinde; Knew Kings their strength, our freedome were to serue. But Fate doth to her selfe reserue both these, With each to punish other, when it please. Grant that we be the stuffe for Princes art, By, and on it, to build their Thrones aboue vs: Yet if Kings be the head, we be the heart; And know we loue no soule, that doth not loue vs. Mens many passions iudge the worst at length, And they that doe so, easily know their strength: With bruit, and rumor, as with hope, and feare, You lay vs low, or lift vs from our earth; You trie what nature, what our States can beare; By law you bind the liberties of birth; Making the People bellowes vnto Fame, Which vshers heauy doomes with euill name. Kings gouerne People, ouer-racke them not: Fleece vs; but doe not clippe vs to the quicke. Thinke not with good, and ill, to write, and blot: The good doth vanish, where the ill doth sticke. Hope not with trifles to grow popular; Wounds that are heal'd for euer leaue a scarre. To offer People showes makes vs too great: Princes descend not, keep your selues aboue. The Sunne drawes not our browes vp, but our sweat: Your safest racke to winde vs vp is Loue. To maske your vice in pompes is vainly done: Motes lie not hidden in beames of a Sunne. The stampe of Soueraignty makes currant Home brasse to buy, or sell, as well as gold: Yet marke! the Peoples standard is the warrant What man ought not to doe, and what he should. Of words we are the Grammar, and of deeds The haruest both is ours, and eke the seeds. We are the glasse of Power, and doe reflect That Image backe, which it to vs presents: If Princes flatter, straight we doe neglect; If they be fine, we see, yet seeme content. Nor can the Throne, which Monarchs doe liue in, Shaddow Kings faults, or sanctifye their sinne. Make not the Church to vs an instrument Of bondage, to your selues of libertie: Obedience there confirmes your Gouernment; Our Soueraignes, Gods Subalternes you be: Else while Kings fashion God in humane light, Men see, and skorne what is not Infinite. Make not the end of Iustice, Checquer-gaine, It is the Liberality of Kings: Oppression, and Extortion euer raigne, When Lawes looke more on Scepters, than on things. Make crooked that line which you measure by; And marre the fashion straight of Monarchie. Why doe you then prophane your Royall line, Which we hold sacred, and dare not approach? Their wounds, and wrongs proue you are not diuine, And we learne, by example, to encroch. Your Fathers losse of eyes foretells his end: By craft, which lets downe Princes, we ascend. How shall the People hope? how stay their feare, When old foundations daily are made new? Vncertaine is a heauy loade to beare; What is not constant sure was neuer true. Excesse in one makes all indefinite: Where nothing is our owne, there what delight? Kings then take heed! Men are the bookes of fate, Wherein your vices deep engrauen lye, To shew our God the griefe of euery State. And though great bodies do not straightwaies die; Yet know, Your errors haue this proper doome, Euen in our ruine to prepare your tombe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus Scena Prima. Alaham alone. Alaham. Chance now congratulates. This is indeed A Princely worke, and fashions nature new, To sacrifice the liuing to the dead; And with reuenge be to a Kingdome led. My father, brother, sister, and my King; All slaine for me? Obedience! Duty! Loue! Your followers to such height when do you bring. Now Hala's Present, this Triumphant Robe Shewes all Estates, things reall, humors, lawes, Yea Wiues themselues owe homage vnto might: Iustice in Kings cannot be definite. Hala, who stroue, by strength of wit, and passion, To change, inforce, deceiue, or vndermine Me, as a Man; yet to a Princes place Humbles her pride, and striues to purchase grace. When I ordain'd this maske, and first decreed A specious death for Prince, and Parent too; I felt once tendernesse, that euill weed, Which some call Dutie; others, Natures Lawes: Should I haue lost a Crowne for such applause? No, No: Each State peculiar wisdomes hath, The way of Princes is to hide their mindes: For else each slaue will suddenly descrie Our inward passions, which they trafficke by. Remisnesse did in me no sooner moue, And only by a pawse it selfe expresse; But straightway they diuin'd remorse, or loue; And instantly drew arguments from both, As if distraction to resolue were loth. But, like a Sultan, mixing power with art; When I made good my will, and only said; Sirs, doe your charge. This intermittent passion Is but the print of naturall affection; The seat of Iustice is aboue compassion: Straight, as if Furies breath had fild these bladders, With cruell hearts their charge they vndertooke; And euer after made my will their booke. Who gouerne men, if they will stay aboue, Must see, and scorne the downfalls of selfe-loue. Nay, marke againe what glory Order yeelds, Where euery spirit is fitted to his roome. Did not distresse these weake Ghosts well become? At which fine playes of Chance, and intercession, Did I relent? Or had I any sense, But in the glories of Omnipotence? These Scepter-mysteries Kings must obserue, Or not be Kings. Are priuate vertues such? âWant great Estates no other strengths but those, âWhich make them, for good words, good fortune lose? As Dogges their kennels, these their graues did frame: 'Twas crafty power that gaue such lawes to fame. Away they went, rich in selfe-pitties smoke, No hope of praise, but by their forme of death; Nor of reuenge, but in the Peoples breath. While I ascending roame to looke about, And in the strength of confidence, and power, Behold the vnprosperities of doubt. But harke! What mournfull harmonie is this? In dole my Triumphs are. What sounds are these; Change! is thy nature both to grieue, and please? Confused Echo's! whither doe you flye? Or whence proceed? From grudge? or from applause? Except my will, craues Mankinde any lawes? Solemnity inferres the worke is ended: Yet heare I noyse that showes vnquiet motion; As from their ashes some new worke intended. Now shall we know: Behold! I see one come, Whose looks bring woe, and horrour from that Tombe. Scena secunda. Nuntius. Alaham. Nvntius. Distract, confus'd, are all my inward spirits: Griefe would complaine, yet dares not speake for feare. Horrour the place of wonder disinherits. Caines next of kinne so willingly to die, For pompe, and honor to his funerall; The flesh to couet that which flesh doth fly; This wonder went I to the Pile to see: As costly glories of the vanity. In stead of these; I saw the veyles of Power, Practise, and pompe, specious hypocrisie, Rent from her face, euen while she did deuoure. I saw those glorious stiles of Gouernment, God, Lawes, Religion (wherein Tyrants hide The wrongs they doe, and all the woes we bide) Wounded, prophan'd, destroy'd. Power is vnwise, That thinkes in pompe to maske her Tyrannies. Looke where he stands! a Monster growne within, Still thirsty, and yet full with Parents blood: Both man, and Tyrant dearly vnderstood. Alaham. Hath meeke deuotion finished her worke? Tell what their manner was; and how they died; That to the dead would thus be crucified. Nuntius. The fire, though mercilesse, yet sometimes iust, Hath done his part; deuoured, but refin'd; Perform'd thy will, and yet deceiu'd thy trust. Alaham. Speake plaine: What threatning mysteries be these? Nuntius. Echos they be of murmurs, which possesse The hearts of men against Powers wickednesse. The first which burnt, as Caine his next of kinne, In blood your Brother, and your Prince in State, Drew wonder from mens hearts brought horror in. This innocent, this soule too meeke for sinne, Yet made for others to doe harme withall, With his selfe-pitty teares, drew teares from vs; His blood, compassion had; his wrong, stirr'd hate: Deceipt is odious in a Kings Estate. Repiningly he goes vnto his end: Strange Visions rise; strange Furies haunt the flame; People crie out; Echo repeats his name. These words he spake, euen breathing out his breath: âVnhappy weaknesse! neuer innocent! âIf in a Crowne, yet but an instrument. âPeople! obserue; this fact may make you see: âExcesse hath ruin'd what it selfe did build: âBut ah! the more opprest, the more you yeeld. The next was he, whose age had reuerence; His gesture something more than priuatenesse; Guided by one, whose stately grace did moue Compassion, euen in hearts that could not loue. As soone as these approched neare the flame, The winde, the steame, or furies, rays'd their vayles; And in their lookes this image did appeare: Each, vnto other; life, to neither deare. These words he spake: âBehold one that hath lost âHimselfe within; and so the world without; âA King that brings authority in doubt: âThis is the fruit of Powers misgouernment. âPeople! my fall is iust; yet strange your fate, âThat, vnder worst, will hope for better State. Griefe roares alowd. Your Sister yet remain'd, Helping in death to him in whom she died, Then going to her owne, as if she gain'd, These mild words spake with lookes to heauen bent: âO God! 'Tis thou that suffrest here, not we: âWrong doth but like it selfe in working thus: âAt thy will, Lord! Reuenge thy selfe, not vs. The fire straight vpward beares the soules in breath: Visions of horror circle in the flame, With shapes, and figures like to that of death; But lighter-tongu'd, and nimbler-wing'd than fame: Some to the Church; some to the People fly: A voyce cries out; Reuenge, and Liberty. Princes! Take heed; Your glory is your care; And Powers foundations, Strengths, not Vices, are. Alaham. What change is this, that now I feele within? Is it disease that workes this fall of spirits? Or workes this fall of spirits my disease? Things seeme not as they did; horror appeares. What sinne imbodied, what strange sight is this? Doth sense bring backe but what within me is? Or doe I see those shapes which haunt the flame? What summons vp remorse? Shall Conscience rate Kings deeds, to make them lesse than their Estate? Ah silly ghost! is't you that swarme about? Would'st thou, that art not now, a father be? These body lawes doe with the life goe out. What thoughts be these that doe my entrailes teare? You wandring spirits frame in me your hell; I feele my brother, and my sister there. Where is my wife? There lacks no more but shee: Let all my owne together dwell with me. Scena tertia. Hala. Alaham. Hala. Wife! Is that name but stile of thy remorse? Must I goe where thy silly parents be? Thou yet but feel'st thy selfe: thou shalt feele me. A King? And in a Throne built out of blood: The ashes of your owne must giue you power. Glutton Ambition! now thy selfe deuoure. Looke in thy Conscience, that vnflattering glasse; See there the wounds of Caine, thy wrongs to me: Death triumphs now; And I doe giue it thee. Caine here beginnes to liue, whilst thou do'st feed Vpon the poyson, that thy wife deuis'd: Thy debter yet; but stay I will exceed. Now warre thy selfe: a King, with Kings must warre: We are too base for friends, or enemies: For lusts vse, not for loue, we women are. All paines of death my selfe in Caine did feele; And shall my rage aspire but to be iust? What is but once; be long in doing must. Alaham. Infernall wombe! receiue thy right. Of old This body was thine owne, before I was. Obey my father, brother, sister, me: I gaue their ghosts; they must giue mine to thee. They call, I come. It was my sinne alone, That gloried many wayes to tyrannize: For all the doomes of ill let me suffice. Hala. My Griefe doth yet but roame it selfe in sense: Hala is more: Rage multiplies with vse: These doe but mourne; I must reuenge abuse. Euen through thy sense will I send in thine owne: This child, that by thee liu'd shall in thee die; In this will Caine, and I possesse thy Throne. Alaham. Ah powerfull God! why do'st thou Thunders spend (By chance, or without vengeance) on the plants; Since it is Man, not Trees, that doth offend? Sirs! teare the roofe; perfect the worke of Power: I haue no being, while she there doth sit, Subiect in sexe, but King, in rage of wit. Hala. Women! Behold, our sex I now improue: Malice were vaine, if Kings could it subdue: This rage reuiues the dead; restores my loue. Alaham. Is this Ormus? Or is Ormus my hell, Where only Furies, and not Men, doe dwell? The poyson works; I feele my spirits faint; I must beseech; my Power is but complaint. Yet Wit! thou know'st what euery Power can doe; Be Strength to me. Can Mothers kill their owne? Selfe-loue will spare them. Why should I request? Words doe inflame. But ah! it Hala is: I must intreat. Her malice keepes no fashion: Though she haue all, that all is but one Passion. If I intreat; doth sense show where to wound? I owe it mine; doth that giue malice Power? Ah God! What shall I doe, that both within, and out, Authority haue lost? Vnused to request, Yet must, and will: Yet, euen in doing, know; Impossible, addes but more scorne to woe. Hala! I doe, with Nature, begge for thine. Harme me alone thy Husband, and thy King. Horror hath her degrees: there is excesse. In all Reuenge, that may be done with lesse. Hala. Beyond the rule of Law, but not of Loue, This child was borne; this not in Loue, but Law. Before thy wrongs I had my passions free: And in reuenge shall ought else limit me? Alaham. Innocent, thine owne, too yong for hate, or feare: His death doth only execration beare. Hala. In him thou art: in him I plague my lust, Where Sense, and Law, were traytors to affection. Beare children only but to Caine I must. Alaham. Disease, or Griefe (I know not which) or both: Languish my powers: Hala! some respite giue; Spare him a while: I haue not long to liue. Hala. Hala! make haste to multiply this wretch; I must haue both his sense, and iudgement free: 'Tis horror, not disease, that honors me. âAll you superiour Powers, which from aboue âBehold this earth; and earthly mischiefes rod! âCast hence your eyes. These works are but for two: âFor him, that suffers; and for me, that doe. Hala! then on: that Alaham may enrage, Enrage thou first. New married now am I: Remorse doth but for men in ambush lie. She mistaking, kills Caines childe. Alaham. Earth! Stand'st thou fast vnder this vglinesse? And fal'st not downe to that infernall deepe, Which feares (perchance) worse than it selfe to keepe? Eyes! close your liddes: There is no more to doe: Yet know, you haue seene that before you die, Which no Age will beleeue; One worse than I. Hala. Ah curst Mortality! So soone put out? And haue I lost the glory of Reuenge, If Fame find greater, as she goes about? This blood, that bloody throte should haue deuour'd: Rage lack'd in this. Where is the place for scorne; Since woes be dead in him, as soone as borne? Flesh is too brittle mould for braue excesse. Yet let these scraps giue nourishment to Fame; Since Loue, and Rage this modell may expresse. She findes her error. But what is this? Wake I, or doe I dreame? If chang'd; with whom, or into whom am I? Doth Horror dazell sense, or multiply? What world is this? Where's Alaham? where my Sonne? Caine! rise, and tell what Furies raised be. Do'st Thou remaine aliue? And art Thou dead? Who did this deed? None answers. It was I. Verses here doe lengthen. And am I thus misled to lose Child, Husband, Fame, Honor, Reuenge, my Caine, my Harmes, and Fury too? And cannot harme my selfe, that those harmes to me doe. Must I forgiue thee, Hala! that none else forgiue? Scarce trembling doth my heart conceiue this hatefull deed? Doe eyes behold this worke, and neither weepe, nor bleed? Shall I complaine of Heauen, where fooles lay selfe-despaire? Or Hell shall I inuoke, which ill hath euery where? Shall I remaine aliue, and turne my rage to woe? Shall I distinguish Guilt, where Chance doth ouerthrow? Is Caine no more? Is it no more to loue? Hath Hala's hate made many hearts to bleed, Vpon the ruines of her loue to feed? Furie! art thou so long in getting vp Aboue the mists of poore selfe-pittie Teares? Shall Rage be still a prisoner vnder feares? Looke! here is death: Return'st thou me remorse? Heere my belou'd: Can sighs recall him backe? Here him I loath: Can scorne become his wracke? My selfe yet liue: Must Fury burne without? These were in me: May Nature liue in one? What's due to death? Euen Rage that growes to doubt. Come Infant! Here is Empire. Let vs liue. This worke is mine: Hell thankes, and enuies me; And loe! her Spirits, before I come, I see. Discord, Sedition, Rage, you Furies all! Possesse againe the State, where you beganne: The Woman you; 'Tis we deceiue the Man. Enter vpon this large infernall wombe; Repay your selues; this mould did make you all. Why doe you stay? Leade me the way: I come. Flesh is too weake, it hath satietie; Lust, intermittent here; and Furie, poore; Rage, hath respects; Desires, here weary be. Leaue Man this meane: Let vs liue in excesse; Where power is more, although the ioyes be lesse. This Child is none of mine: I had no part: Beare him I did with loathing, not desire: My wombe perchance did yeeld, but not my heart. With Alaham his father he must dwell: I will goe downe, and change this Ghost with hell. This Tragedy, called Alaham, may bee printed, this 23. of June, 1632. Henry Herbert.</field>
