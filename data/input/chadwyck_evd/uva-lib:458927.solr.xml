      <field name="fulltext">THE MAD LOVER.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Si quid habent veri Vatum prÃ¦sagia, vivam.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE PHILIP Earle of Pembroke and Mountgomery: Baron Herbert of Cardiffe and Sherland, Lord Parr and Ross of Kendall; Lord Fitz-Hugh, Marmyon, and Saint Quintin; Knight of the most noble Order of the Garter; and one of His Majesties most Honourable Privie Councell: And our Singular Good Lord.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Stationer. Tell the sad World that now the lab'ring Presse H'as brought forth safe a Child of happinesse, The Frontis-piece will satisfie the wise And good so well, they will not grudge the price. 'Tis not all Kingdomes joyn'd in one could buy (If priz'd aright) so true a Library Of man: where we the characters may finde Of ev'ry Nobler and each baser minde. Desert has here reward in one good line For all it lost, for all it might repine: Vile and ignobler things are open laid, The truth of their false colours are displayd: You'l say the Poet's both best Judge and Priest, No guilty soule abides so sharp a test As their smooth Pen; for what these rare men writ Commands the World, both Honesty and Wit. GRANDISON.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN MEMORY OF Mr. Iohn Fletcher. Mee thought our Fletcher weary of this croud, Wherein so few have witt, yet all are loud, Unto Elyzium fled, where he alone Might his own witt admire and ours bemoane; But soone upon those Flowry Bankes, a throng Worthy of those even numbers which he sung, Appear'd, and though those Ancient Laureates strive When dead themselves, whose raptures should survive, For his Temples all their owne bayes allowes, Not sham'd to see him crown'd with naked browes; Homer his beautifull Achilles nam'd, Vrging his braine with Joves might well be fam'd, Since it brought forth one full of beauties charmes, As was his Pallas, and as bold in Armes; King and no King.But when he the brave Arbases saw, one That saved his peoples dangers by his own, And saw Tigranes by his hand undon Without the helpe of any Mirmydon, He then confess'd when next hee'd Hector slay, That he must borrow him from Fletchers Play; This might have beene the shame, for which he bid His Iliades in a Nut-shell should be hid: Virgill of his Ãneas next begun, Whose God-like forme and tongue so soone had wonne; That Queene of Carthage and of beauty too, Two powers the whole world else were slaves unto, Vrging that Prince for to repaire his faulte On earth, boldly in hell his Mistresse sought; The Maides Tragedy.But when he Amintor saw revenge that wrong, For which the sad Aspasia sigh'd so long, Vpon himselfe, to shades hasting away, Not for to make a visit but to stay; He then did modestly confesse how farr Fletcher out-did him in a Charactar. Now lastly for a refuge, Virgill shewes The lines where Corydon Alexis woes; But those in opposition quickly met The faithfull Shepherdesse.The smooth tongu'd Perigot and Amoret: A paire whom doubtlesse had the others seene, They from their owne loves had Apostates beene; Thus Fletcher did the fam'd laureat exceed, Both when his Trumpet sounded and his reed; Now if the Ancients yeeld that heretofore, None worthyer then those ere Laurell wore; The least our age can say now thou art gon, Is that there never will be such a one: And since t'expresse thy worth, our rimes too narrow be, To help it wee'l be ample in our prophesie. H. HOWARD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr John Fletcher, and his Workes, never before published. To flatter living fooles is easie slight: But hard, to do the living-dead men right. To praise a Landed Lord, is gainfull art: But thanklesse to pay Tribute to desert. This should have been my taske: I had intent To bring my rubbish to thy monument, To stop some crannies there, but that I found No need of lease repaire; all firme and sound. Thy well-built fame doth still it selfe advance Above the Worlds mad zeale and ignorance, Though thou dyedst not possest of that same pelfe (Which Nobler soules call durt,) the City wealth: Yet thou hast left unto the times so great A Legacy, a Treasure so compleat, That 'twill be hard I feare to prove thy Will: Men will be wrangling, and in doubting still How so vast summes of wit were left behind, And yet nor debts nor sharers they can finde. 'Twas the kind providence of fate, to lock Some of this Treasure up; and keep a stock For a reserve untill these sullen daies: When scorn, and want, and danger, are the Baies That Crown the head of merit. But now be Who in thy Will hath part, is rich and free. But there's a Caveat enter'd by command, None should pretend, but those can understand. HENRY MODY, Baronet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON Mr Fletchers Works. Though Poets have a licence which they use As th'ancient priviledge of their free Muse; Yet whether this be leave enough for me To write, great Bard, an Eulogie for thee: Or whether to commend thy Worke, will stand Both with the Lawes of Verse and of the Land, Were to put doubts might raise a discontent Between the Muses and theâ I'le none of that. There's desperate wits that be (As their immortall Lawrell) Thunder-free; Whose personall vertues, 'bove the Lawes of Fate, Supply the roome of personall estate: And thus enfranchis'd, safely may rehearse, Rapt in a lofty straine, theirs own neck-verse. For he that gives the Bayes to thee, must then First take it from the Militarie Men; He must untriumph conquests, bid 'em stand, Question the strength of their victorious hand. He must act new things, or go neer the sin, Reader, as neer as you and I have been: He must be that, which He that tryes will swear It is not good being so another Yeare. And now that thy great name I've brought to this, To do it honour is to do amisse, What's to be done to those, that shall refuse To celebrate, great Soule, thy noble Muse? Shall the poore State of all those wandring things, Thy Stage once rais'd to Emperors and Kings? Shall rigid forfeitures (that reach our Heires) Of things that only fill with cares and feares? Shall the privation of a friendlesse life, Made up of contradictions and strife? Shall He be entitie, would antedate His own poore name, and thine annihilate? Shall these be judgements great enough for one That dares not write thee an Encomion? Then where am J? but now I've thought upon't, I'le prayse thee more then all have ventur'd on't. I'le take thy noble Work (and like the trade Where for a heap of Salt pure Gold is layd) I'le lay the Volume, that Huge Tome of wit, About in Ladies Closets, where they sit Enthron'd in their own wills; and if she bee A Laick sister, shee'l straight flie to thee: But if a holy Habit shee have on, Or be some Novice, shee'l scarce looke upon Thy Lines at first; but watch Her then a while, And you shall see Her steale a gentle smile Vpon thy Title, put thee neerer yet, Breath on thy Lines a whisper, and then set Her voyce up to the measures; then begin To blesse the houre, and happy state shee's in. Now shee layes by her Characters, and lookes With a stern eye on all her pretty Bookes. Shee's now thy Voteresse, and the just Crowne She brings thee with it, is worth half the Towne. I'le send thee to the Army, they that fight Will read thy tragedies with some delight, Be all thy Reformadoes, fancy scars, And pay too, in thy speculative wars. I'le send thy Comick scenes to some of those That for a great while have plaid fast and loose; New universalists, by changing shapes, Have made with wit and fortune faire escapes. Then shall the Countrie that poor Tennis-ball Of angry fate, receive thy Pastorall, And from it learn those melancholy straines Fed the afflicted soules of Primitive swaines. Thus the whole World to reverence will flock Thy Tragick Buskin and thy Comick Stock: And winged fame unto posterity Transmit but onely two, this Age, and Thee. Thomas Peyton. Agricola Anglo-Cantianus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ON THE Deceased Authour, Mr John Fletcher, his Plays; and especially, The Mad Lover. Whilst his well organ'd body doth retreat, To its first matter, and the formall heat Triumphant sits in judgement to approve Pieces above our Candour and our love: Such as dare boldly venter to appeare Unto the curious eye, and Criticke eare: Lo the Mad Lover in these various times Is press'd to life, t'accuse us of our crimes. While Fletcher liv'd, who equall to him writ Such lasting Monuments of naturall wit? Others might draw their lines with sweat, like those That (with much paines) a Garrison inclose; Whilst his sweet fluent veine did gently runne As uncontrold, and smoothly as the Sun. After his death our Theatres did make Him in his own unequald Language speake: And now when all the Muses out of their Approved modesty silent appeare, This Play of Fletchers braves the envious light As wonder of our eares once, now our sight. Three and fourfold blest Poet, who the Lives Of Poets, and of Theaters survives! A Groome, or Ostler of some wit may bring His Pegasus to the Castalian spring; Boast he a race o're the Pharsalian plaine, Or happy Tempe valley dares maintaine: Brag at one leape upon the double Cliffe (Were it as high as monstrous Tennariffe) Of farre-renown'd Parnassus he will get, And there (t'amaze the World) confirme his seate: When our admired Fletcher vaunts not ought, And slighted every thing be writ as naught: While all our English wondring world (in's cause) Made this great City eccho with applause. Read him therefore all that can read, and those That cannot learne, if y' are not Learnings foes, And wilfully resolved to refuse The gentle Raptures of this happy Muse. From thy great constellation (noble Soule) Looke on this Kingdome, suffer not the whole Spirit of Poesie retire to Heaven, But make us entertaine what thou hast given. Earthquakes and Thunder Diapasons make The Seas vast roare, and irresistlesse shake Of horrid winds, a sympathy compose; So in these things there's musicke in the close: And though they seem great Discords in our eares, They are not so to them above the Spheares. Granting these Musicke, how much sweeter's that Mnemosyne's daughter's voyces doe create? Since Heaven, and Earth, and Seas, and Ayre consent To make an Harmony (the Instrument, Their own agreeing selves) shall we refuse The Musicke which the Deities doe use? Troys ravisht Ganymed doth sing to Jove, And PhÅbus selfe playes on his Lyre above. The Cretan Gods, or glorious men, who will Imitate right, must wonder at thy skill, Best Poet of thy times, or he will prove As mad as thy brave Memnon was with love. ASTON COKAINE, Baronet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the Works of Beaumont, and Fletcher. How Angels (cloyster'd in our humane Cells) Maintaine their parley, Beaumount-Fletcher tels; Whose strange unimitable Intercourse Transcends all Rules, and flyes beyond the force Of the most forward soules; all must submit Untill they reach these Mysteries of Wit. The Intellectuall Language here's exprest, Admir'd in better times, and dares the Test Of Ours; for from Wit, Sweetnesse, Mirth, and Sence, This Volume springs a new true Quintessence. JO. PETTUS, Knight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Works of the most excellent Dramatick Poet, Mr. John Fletcher, never before Printed. Haile Fletcher, welcome to the worlds great Stage; For our two houres, we have thee here an age In thy whole Works, and may th'Impression call The Pretor that presents thy Playes to all: Both to the People, and the Lords that sway That Herd, and Ladies whom those Lords obey. And what's the Loadstone can such guests invite But moves on two Poles, Profit, and Delight, Which will be soon, as on the Rack, confest When every one is tickled with a jest: And that pure Fletcher, able to subdue A Melancholy more then Burton knew. And though upon the by, to his designes The Native may learne English from his lines, And th'Alien if he can but construe it, May here be made free Denison of wit. But his maine end does drooping Vertue raise, And crownes her beauty with eternall Bayes; In ScÃ¦nes where she inflames the frozen soule, While Vice (her paint washt off) appeares so foule; She must this Blessed Isle and Europe leave, And some new Quadrant of the Globe deceive: Or hide her Blushes on the Affrike shore Like Marius, but ne're rise to triumph more; That honour is resign'd to Fletchers fame; Adde to his Trophies, that a Poets name (Late growne as odious to our Moderne states As that of King to Rome) he vindicates From black aspertions, cast upon't by those Which only are inspir'd to lye in prose. And, By the Court of Muses be't decreed, What graces spring from Poesy's richer seed, When we name Fletcher shall be so proclaim'd, As all that's Royall is when CÃ¦sar's nam'd. ROBERT STAPYLTON Knight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the memory of my most honoured kinsman, Mr. Francis Beaumont. I'le not pronounce how strong and cleane thou writes, Nor by what new hard Rules thou took'st thy Flights, Nor how much Greek and Latin some refine Before they can make up six words of thine, But this I'le say, thou strik'st our sense so deep, At once thou mak'st us Blush, Rejoyce, and Weep. Great Father Iohnson bow'd himselfe when hee (Thou writ'st so nobly) vow'd he envy'd thee. Were thy Mardonius arm'd, there would be more Strife for his Sword then all Achilles wore, Such wise just Rage, had Hee been lately try'd My life on't Hee had been o'th' Better side, And where hee found false odds (through Gold or Sloath) There brave Mardonius would have beat them Both. Behold, here's Fletcher too! the World ne're knew Two Potent Witts co-operate till You; For still your fancies are so wov'n and knit, 'Twas Francis-Fletcher, or Iohn Beaumont writ. Yet neither borrow'd, nor were so put to't To call poore Godds and Goddesses to do't; Nor made Nine Girles your Muses (you suppose Women ne're write, save Love-Letters in prose) But are your owne Inspirers, and have made Such pow'rfull Sceanes, as when they please, invade. Your Plot, Sence, Language, All's so pure and fit, Hee's Bold, not Valiant, dare dispute your Wit. George Lisle Knight.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr. JOHN FLETCHER'S VVorkes. So shall we joy, when all whom Beasts and Wormes Had turn'd to their owne substances and formes, Whom Earth to Earth, or fire hath chang'd to fire, Wee shall behold more then at first intire As now we doe, to see all thine, thine owne In this thy Muses Resurrection, Whose scatter'd parts, from thy owne Race, more wounds Hath suffer'd, then Acteon from his hounds; Which first their Braines, and then their Bellies fed, And from their excrements new Poets bred. But now thy Muse inraged from her urne Like Ghosts of Murdred bodyes doth returne To accuse the Murderers, to right the Stage, And undeceive the long abused Age, Which casts thy praise on them, to whom thy Wit Gives not more Gold then they give drosse to it: Who not content like fellons to purloyne, Adde Treason to it, and debase thy Coyne. But whither am I strayd? I need not raise Trophies to thee from other Mens dispraise; Nor is thy fame on lesser Ruines built, Nor needs thy juster title the foule guilt Of Easterne Kings, who to secure their Raigne, Must have their Brothers, Sonnes, and Kindred slaine. Then was wits Empire at the fatall height, When labouring and sinking with its weight, From thence a thousand lesser Poets sprong Like petty Princes from the fall of Rome. When Johnson, Shakespeare, and thy selfe did sit, And sway'd in the Triumvirate of witâ Yet what from Johnsons oyle and sweat did flow, Or what more easie nature did bestow On Shakespeares gentler Muse, in thee full growne Their Graces both appeare, yet so, that none Can say here Nature ends, and Art begins But mixt like th'Elements, and borne like twins, So interweav'd, so like, so much the same, None this meere Nature, that meere Art can name: 'Twas this the Ancients meant, Nature and Skill Are the two topps of their Pernassus Hill. I. Denham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vpon Mr. John Fletcher's Playes. Fletcher, to thee, wee doe not only owe All these good Playes, but those of others too: Thy wit repeated, does support the Stage, Credits the last, and entertaines this age: No Worthies form'd by any Muse but thine Could purchase Robes to make themselves so fine: What brave Commander is not proud to see Thy brave Melantius in his Gallantry, Our greatest Ladyes love to see their scorne Out-done by Thine, in what themselves have worne: Th'impatient Widow ere the yeare be done Sees thy Aspasia weeping in her Gowne: I never yet the Tragick straine assay'd Deterr'd by that inimitable Maid: And when I venture at the Comick stile Thy Scornfull Lady seemes to mock my toile: Thus has thy Muse, at once, improv'd and marr'd Our Sport in Playes, by rendring it too hard. So when a sort of lusty Shepheards throw The barre by turns, and none the rest outgoe So farre, but that the best are measuring casts, Their emulation and their pastime lasts; But if some Brawny yeoman, of the guard Step in and tosse the Axeltree a yard Or more beyond the farthest Marke, the rest Despairing stand, their sport is at the best.

      <field name="fulltext">To FLETCHER Reviv'd. How have I been Religious? what strange Good Ha's scap't me that I never understood? Have I Hell-guarded HÃ¦resie o'rethrowne? Heald wounded States? made Kings and Kingdomes one? That Fate should be so mercifull to me, To let me live t'have said I have read thee. Faire Star ascend! the Ioy! the Life! the Light Of this tempestuous Age, this darke worlds sight! Oh from thy Crowne of Glory dart one flame May strike a sacred Reverence, whilest thy Name (Like holy Flamens to their God of Day) We bowing, sing; and whilst we praise, we pray. Bright Spirit! whose Ãternall motion Of Wit, like Time, still in it selfe did runne; Binding all others in it, and did give Commission, how far this, or that shall live: Like Destinie of Poems, who, as she Signes death to all, her selfe can never dye. And now thy purple-robed Tragoedie, In her imbroider'd Buskins, calls mine eye, ValentinianWhere brave AÃ«tius we see betray'd, T'obey his Death, whom thousand lives obey'd; Whilst that the Mighty Foole his Scepter breakes, And through his Gen'rals wounds his owne doome speaks, Weaving thus richly Valentinian The costliest Monarch with the cheapest man. Souldiers may here to their old glories adde, The Mad Lover. The Lover love, and be with reason mad: Not as of old, Alcides furious, VVho wilder then his Bull did teare the house, (Hurling his Language with the Canvas stone) 'Twas thought the Monster roar'd the sob'rer Tone. Tragi-comedies.But ah, when thou thy sorrow didst inspire VVith Passions, blacke as is her darke attire, Virgins as Sufferers have wept to see Arcas. Bellario. So white a Soule, so red a Crueltie; That thou hast griev'd, and with unthought redresse, Dri'd their wet eyes who now thy mercy blesse; Yet loth to lose thy watry jewell, when Ioy wip't it off, Laughter straight sprung't agen. Now ruddy cheeked Mirth with Rosie wings, Comedies. The Spanish Curate. The Humorous Lieutenant. The Tamer Tam'd. The little French Lawyer. Fanns ev'ry brow with gladnesse, whilest she sings Delight to all, and the whole Theatre A Festivall in Heaven doth appeare: Nothing but Pleasure, Love, and (like the Morne) Each face a generall smiling doth adorne. Heare ye foule Speakers, that pronounce the Aire Of Stewes and Shores, I will informe you where And how to cloathe aright your wanton wit, Without her nasty Bawd attending it. View here a loose thought said with such a grace, The custom of the Countrey. Minerva might have spoke in Venus face; So well disguis'd, that t'was conceiv'd by none But Cupid had Diana's linnen on; And all his naked parts so vail'd, th'expresse The Shape with clowding the uncomlinesse; That if this Reformation which we Receiv'd, had not been buried with thee, The Stage (as this work) might have liv'd and lov'd; Her Lines; the austere Skarlet had approv'd, And th'Actors wisely been from that offence As cleare, as they are now from Audience. Thus with thy Genius did the ScÃ¦ne expire, Wanting thy Active and inliv'ning fire, That now (to spread a darknesse over all,) Nothing remaines but Poesie to fall. And though from these thy Embers we receive Some warmth, so much as may be said, we live, That we dare praise thee, blushlesse, in the head Of the best piece Hermes to Love e're read, That We rejoyce and glory in thy Wit, And feast each other with remembring it, That we dare speak thy thought, thy Acts recite: Yet all men henceforth be afraid to write.

      <field name="fulltext">On Master JOHN FLETCHERS Dramaticall Poems. Great tutelary Spirit of the Stage! Fletcher! I can fix nothing but my rage Before thy Workes, 'gainst their officious crime Who print thee now, in the worst scÃ¦ne of Time. For me, uninterrupted hadst thou slept Among the holly shades and close hadst kept The mistery of thy lines, till men might bee Taught how to reade, and then, how to reade thee. But now thou art expos'd to th'common fate, Revive then (mighty Soule!) and vindicate From th'Ages rude affronts thy injured fame, Instruct the Envious, with how chast a flame Thou warmst the Lover; how severely just Thou wert to punish, if he burnt to lust. With what a blush thou didst the Maid adorne, But tempted, with how innocent a scorne. How Epidemick errors by thy Play VVere laught out of esteeme, so purg'd away. How to each sence thou so didst vertue fit, That all grew vertuous to be thought t'have wit. But this was much too narrow for thy art, Thou didst frame governments, give Kings their part, Teach them how neere to God, while just they be; But how dissolv'd, stretcht forth to Tyrannie. How Kingdomes, in their channell, safely run, But rudely overflowing are undone. Though vulgar spirits Poets scorne or hate: Man may beget, A Poet can create. Will. Habington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vpon Master FLETCHERS Dramaticall Workes. What? now the Stage is down, darst thou appeare Bold Fletcer in this tottring Hemisphear? Yes; Poets are like Palmes which, the more weight You cast upon them grow more strong &amp; streight, 'Tis not love's Thunderbolt, nor Mars his Speare, Or Neptune's angry Trident, Poets fear. Had now grim Ben bin breathing, with what rage, And high-swolne fury had Hee lash'd this age, Shakespeare with Chapman had grown madd, and torn Their gentle Sock, and lofty Buskins worne, To make their Muse welter up to the chin In blood; of faigned ScÃ¦nes no need had bin, England like Lucians Eagle with an Arrow Of her owne Plumes piercing her heart quite thorow, Had bin a Theater and subject fit To exercise in real truth's their wit: Yet none like high-wing'd Fletcher had bin found This Eagles tragick-destiny to sound, Rare Fletcher's quill had soar'd up to the sky, And drawn down Gods to see the tragedy: Live famous Dramatist, let every spring Make thy Bay flourish, and fresh Bourgeons bring: And since we cannot have Thee trod o'th' stage, Wee will applaud Thee in this silent Page.

      <field name="fulltext">On the Edition. Fletcher (whose Fame no Age can ever wast; Envy of Ours, and glory of the last) Is now alive againe; and with his Name His sacred Ashes wak'd into a Flame; Such as before did by a secret charme The wildest Heart subdue, the coldest warme, And lend the Lady's eyes a power more bright, Dispensing thus to either, Heat and Light. He to a Sympathie those soules betrai'd Whom Love or Beauty never could perswade; And in each mov'd spectatour could beget A reall passion by a Counterfeit: When first Bellario bled, what Lady there Did not for every drop let fall a teare? And when Aspasia wept, not any eye But seem'd to weare the same sad livery; By him inspir'd the feign'd Lucina drew More streams of melting sorrow then the true; But then the Scornfull Lady did beguile Their easie griefs, and teach them all to smile. Thus he Affections could, or raise or lay; Love, Griefe and Mirth thus did his Charmes obey: He Nature taught her passions to out-doe, How to refine the old, and create new; Which such a happy likenesse seem'd to beare, As if that Nature Art, Art Nature were. Yet All had Nothing bin, obscurely kept In the same Vrne wherein his Dust hath slept, Nor had he ris' the Delphick wreath to claime, Had not the dying sceane expir'd his Name; Dispaire our joy hath doubled, he is come, Thrice welcome by this Post-liminium. His losse preserv'd him; They that silenc'd Wit, Are now the Authours to Eternize it; Thus Poets are in spight of Fate reviv'd, And Playes by Intermission longer liv'd. Tho. Stanley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Edition of Mr Francis Beaumonts, and Mr John Fletchers Playes never printed before. I am amaz'd; and this same Extacye Is both my Glory and Apology. Sober Ioyes are dull Passions; they must beare Proportion to the Subject: if so; where Beaumont and Fletcher shall vouchsafe to be That Subject; That Ioy must be Extacye. Fury is the Complexion of great Wits; The Fooles Distemper: Hee, thats mad by fits, Is wise so too. It is the Poets Muse; The Prophets God: the Fooles, and my excuse. For (in Me) nothing lesse then Fletchers Name Could have begot, or justify'd this flame. Beaumont/Fletcher Return'd? methinks it should not be. No, not in's Works: Playes are as dead as He. The Palate of this age gusts nothing High; That has not Custard in't or Bawdery. Folly and Madnesse fill the Stage: The ScÃ¦ne Is Athens; where, the Guilty, and the Meane, The Foole 'scapes well enough; Learned and Great, Suffer an Ostracisme; stand Exulate. Mankinde is fall'n againe, shrunke a degree, A step below his very Apostacye. Nature her Selfe is out of Tune; and Sicke Of Tumult and Disorder, Lunatique. Yet what World would not cheerfully endure The Torture, or Disease, t'enjoy the Cure? This Booke's the Balsame, and the Hellebore, Must preserve bleeding Nature, and restore Our Crazy Stupor to a just quick Sence Both of Ingratitude, and Providence. That teaches us (at Once) to feele, and know, Two deep Points: what we want, and what we owe. Yet Great Goods have their Ills: Should we transmit To Future Times, the Pow'r of Love and Wit, In this Example: would they not combine To make Our Imperfections Their Designe? They'd study our Corruptions; and take more Care to be Ill, then to be Good, before. For nothing but so great Infirmity, Could make Them worthy of such Remedy. Have you not seene the Suns almighty Ray Rescue th'affrighted World, and redeeme Day From blacke despaire: how his victorious Beame Scatters the Storme, and drownes the petty flame Of Lightning, in the glory of his eye: How full of pow'r, how full of Majesty? When to us Mortals, nothing else was knowne, But the sad doubt, whether to burne, or drowne. Choler, and Phlegme, Heat, and dull Ignorance, Have cast the people into such a Trance, That feares and danger seeme Great equally, And no dispute left now, but how to dye. Just in this nicke, Fletcher sets the world cleare Of all disorder and reformes us here. The formall Youth, that knew no other Grace, Or Value, but his Title, and his Lace, Glasses himselfe: and in this faithfull Mirrour, Views, disaproves, reformes, repents his Errour. The Credulous, bright Girle, that beleeves all Language, (in Othes) if Good, Canonicall, Is fortifi'd, and taught, here, to beware Of ev'ry specious bayte, of ev'ry snare Save one: and that same Caution takes her more, Then all the flattery she felt before. She finds her Boxes, and her Thoughts betray'd By the Corruption of the Chambermaide: Then throwes her Washes and dissemblings By; And Vowes nothing but Ingenuity. The severe States-man quits his sullen forme Of Gravity and bus'nesse; The Luke-warme Religious his Neutrality; The hot Braine-sicke Illuminate his zeale; The Sot Stupidity; The Souldier his Arreares; The Court its Confidence; The Plebs their feares; Gallants their Apishnesse and Perjurie, Women their Pleasure and Inconstancie; Poets their Wine; the Vsurer his Pelfe; The World its Vanity; and I my Selfe.

      <field name="fulltext">On the Dramatick Poems of Mr John Fletcher. Wonder! who's here? Fletcher, long buried Reviv'd? Tis he! hee's risen from the Dead, His winding sheet put off, walks above ground, Shakes off his Fetters, and is better bound. And may he not, if rightly understood, Prove Playes are lawfull? he hath made them Good. Is any Lover Mad? see here Loves Cure; Vnmarried? to a Wife he may be sure A rare one, For a Moneth; if she displease, The Spanish Curate gives a Writ of ease. Enquire The Custome of the Country, then Shall the French Lawyer set you free againe. If the two Faire Maids take it wondrous ill, (One of the Inne, the other of the Mill,) That th'Lovers Progresse stopt, and they defam'd; Here's that makes Women Pleas'd, and Tamer tam'd. But who then playes the Coxcombe, or will trie His Wit at severall Weapons, or else die? Nice Valour and he doubts not to engage The Noble Gentl'man, in Loves Pilgrimage, To take revenge on the False One, and run The Honest mans Fortune, to be undone Like Knight of Malta, or else Captaine be Or th'Humerous Lieutenant: goe to Sea (A Voyage for to starve) hee's very loath, Till we are all at peace, to sweare an Oath, That then the Loyall Subject may have leave To lye from Beggers Bush, and undeceive The Creditor, discharge his debts; Why so, Since we can't pay to Fletcher what we owe. Oh could his Prophetesse but tell one Chance, When that the Pilgrimes shall returne from France. And once more make this Kingdome, as of late, The Island Princesse, and we celebrate A Double Marriage; every one to bring To Fletchers memory his offering. That thus at last unsequesters the Stage, Brings backe the Silver, and the Golden Age. Robert Gardiner.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Manes of the celebrated Poets and Fellow-writers, Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher, upon the Printing of their excellent Dramatick Poems. Disdaine not Gentle Shades, the lowly praise Which here I tender your immortall Bayes. Call it not folly, but my zeale, that I Strive to eternize you that cannot dye. And though no Language rightly can commend What you have writ, save what your selves have penn'd Yet let me wonder at those curious straines (The rich Conceptions of your twin-like Braines) Which drew the Gods attention; who admir'd To see our English Stage by you inspir'd. Whose chiming Muses never fail'd to sing A Soule-affecting Musicke; ravishing Both Eare and Intellect, while you do each Contend with other who shall highest reach In rare Invention; Conflicts that beget New strange delight, to see two Fancies met, That could receive no foile: two wits in growth So just, as had one Soule informed both. Thence (Learned Fletcher) sung the muse alone, As both had done before, thy Beaumont gone. In whom, as thou, had he outliv'd, so he (Snatch'd first away) survived still in thee. What though distempers of the present Age Have banish'd your smooth numbers from the Stage? You shall be gainers by't; it shall confer To th'making the vast world your Theater. The Presse shall give to ev'ry man his part, And we will all be Actors; learne by heart Those Tragick Scenes and Comicke Straines you writ, Vn-imitable both for Art and Wit; And at each Exit, as your Fancies rise, Our hands shall clap deserved Plaudities. John Web.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the desert of the Author in his most Ingenious Pieces. Thou art above their Censure, whose darke Spirits Respects but shades of things, and seeming merits; That have no soule, nor reason to their will, But rime as ragged, as a Ganders Quill: Where Pride blowes up the Error, and transfer: Their zeale in Tempests, that so wid'ly errs. Like heat and Ayre comprest, their blind desires Mixe with their ends, as raging winds with fires. Whose Ignorance and Passions, weare an eye Squint to all parts of true Humanity. All is Apocripha suits not their vaine: For wit, oh fye! and Learning too; prophane! But Fletcher hath done Miracles by wit, And one Line of his may convert them yet. Tempt them into the State of knowledge, and Happinesse to read and understand. The way is strow'd with Lawrell, and ev'ry Muse Brings Incense to our Fletcher: whose Scenes infuse Such noble kindlings from her pregnant fire, As charmes her Criticke Poets in desire, And who doth read him, that parts lesse indu'd, Then with some heat of wit or Gratitude. Some crowd to touch the Relique of his Bayes, Some to cry up their owne wit in his praise, And thinke they engage it by Comparatives, When from himselfe, himselfe he best derives. Let Shakespeare, Chapman, and applauded Ben, Weare the Eternall merit of their Pen, Here I am love-sicke: and were I to chuse, A Mistris corrivall 'tis Fletcher's Muse. George Buck.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr BEAVMONT. (Written thirty yeares since, presently after his death.) Beaumont lyes here; and where now shall we have A Muse like his to sigh upon his grave? Ah! none to weepe this with a worthy teare, But he that cannnot, Beaumont, that lies here. Who now shall pay thy Tombe with such a Verse As thou that Ladies didst, faire Rutlands Herse? A Monument that will then lasting be, When all her Marble is more dust than she. In thee all's lost: a sudden dearth and want Hath seiz'd on Wit, good Epitaphs are scant; We dare not write thy Elegie, whilst each feares He nere shall match that coppy of thy teares. Scarce in an Age a Poet, and yet he Scarce lives the third part of his age to see, But quickly taken off and only known, Is in a minute shut as soone as showne. Why should weake Nature tire her selfe in vaine In such a peice, to dash it straight againe? Why should she take such worke beyond her skill, Which when she cannot perfect, she must kill? Alas, what is't to temper slime or mire? But Nature's puzled when she workes in fire: Great Braines (like brightest glasse) crack straight, while those Of Stone or Wood hold out, and feare not blowes. And wee their Ancient hoary heads can see Whose Wit was never their mortality: Beaumont dies young, so Sidney did before, There was not Poetry he could live to more, He could not grow up higher, I scarce know If th'art it selfe unto that pitch could grow, Were't not in thee that hadst arriv'd the hight Of all that wit could reach, or Nature might. O when I read those excellent things of thine, Such Strength, such sweetnesse coucht in every line, Such life of Fancy, such high choise of braine, Nought of the Vulgar wit or borrowed straine, Such Passion, such expressions meet my eye, Such Wit untainted with obscenity, And those so unaffectedly exprest, All in a language purely flowing drest, And all so borne within thy selfe, thine owne, So new, so fresh, so nothing trod upon. I grieve not now that old Menanders veine Is ruin'd to survive in thee againe; Such in his time was he of the same peece, The smooth, even naturall Wit, and Love of Greece. Those few sententious fragments shew more worth, Then all the Poets Athens ere brought forth; And I am sorry we have lost those houres On them, whose quicknesse comes far short of ours, And dwell not more on thee, whose every Page Maybe a patterne for their Scene and Stage. I will not yeeld thy Workes so meane a Prayse; More pure, more chaste, more sainted then are Playes, Nor with that dull supinenesse to be read, To passe a fire, or laugh an houre in bed. How doe the Muses suffer every where, Taken in such mouthes censure, in such eares, That twixt a whiffe, a Line or two rehearse, And with their Rheume together spaule a Verse? This all a Poems leisure after Play, Drinke or Tabacco, it may keep the Day. Whilst even their very idlenesse they thinke Is lost in these, that lose their time in drinke. Pity then dull we, we that better know, Will a more serious houre on thee bestow, Why should not Beaumont in the Morning please, As well as Plautus, Aristophanes? Who if my Pen may as my thoughts be free, Were scurrill Wits and Buffons both to Thee; Yet these our Learned of severest brow Will deigne to looke on, and to note them too, That will defie our owne, tis English stuffe, And th'Author is not rotten long enough. Alas what flegme are they, compared to thee, In thy Philaster, and Maids-Tragedy? Where's such an humour as thy Bessus? pray Let them put all their Thrasoes in one Play, He shall out-bid them; their conceit was poore, All in a Circle of a Bawd or Whore; A cozning dance, take the foole away, And not a good jest extant in a Play. Yet these are Wits, because they'r old, and now Being Greeke and Latine, they are Learning too: But those their owne Times were content t'allow A thirsty fame, and thine is lowest now. But thou shalt live, and when thy Name is growne Six Ages older, shall be better knowne, When th'art of Chaucers standing in the Tombe, Thou shalt not share, but take up all his roome. Joh. Earle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">UPON Mr FLETCHERS Incomparable Playes. The Poet lives; wonder not how or why Fletcher revives, but that he er'e could dye: Safe Mirth, full Language, flow in ev'ry Page, At once he doth both heighten and aswage; All Innocence and Wit, pleasant and cleare, Nor Church nor Lawes were ever Libel'd here; But faire deductions drawn from his great Braine, Enough to conquer all that's False or Vaine; He scatters Wit, and Sence so freely flings That very Citizens speake handsome things, Teaching their Wives such unaffected grace, Their Looks are now as handsome as their Face. Nor is this violent, he steales upon The yeilding Soule untill the Phrensie's gone; His very Launcings do the Patient please, As when good Musicke cures a Mad Disease. Small Poets rifle Him, yet thinke it faire, Because they rob a man that well can spare; They feed upon him, owe him every bit, Th'are all but Sub-excisemen of his Wit. I. M.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Workes of Beaumont and Fletcher, now at length printed. Great paire of Authors, whom one equall Starre Begot so like in Genius, that you are In Fame, as well as Writings, both so knit, That no man knowes where to divide your wit, Much lesse your praise; you, who had equall fire, And did each other mutually inspire; Whether one did contrive, the other write, Or one fram'd the plot, the other did indite; Whether one found the matter, th'other dresse, Or the one disposed what th'other did expresse; Where e're your parts betweene your selves lay, we, In all things which you did but one thred see; So evenly drawne out, so gently spunne, That Art with Nature nere did smoother run. Where shall I fixe my praise then? or what part Of all your numerous Labours hath desert More to be fam'd then other? shall I say, I've met a lover so drawne in your Play, So passionately written, so inflam'd; So jealously inraged, then gently tam'd, That I in reading have the Person seene, And your Pen hath part Stage and Actor been? Or shall I say, that I can scarce forbeare To clap, when I a Captain do meet there, So lively in his owne vaine humour drest, So braggingly, and like himself exprest, That moderne Cowards, when they saw him plaid, Saw, blusht, departed guilty, and betraid? You wrote all parts right; whatsoe're the Stage Had from you, was seene there as in the age, And had their equall life: Vices which were Manners abroad, did grow corrected there: They who possest a Box, and halfe Crowne spent To learne Obscenenes, returned innocent, And thankt you for this coznage, whose chaste Scene Taught Loves so noble, so reform'd, so cleane, That they who brought foule sires, and thither came To bargaine, went thence with a holy flame. Be't to your praise too, that your Stock and Veyne Held both to Tragick and to Comick straine; Where e're you listed to be high and grave, No Buskin shew'd more solemne, no quill gave Such feeling objects to draw teares from eyes, Spectators sate part in your Tragedies. And where you lifted to be low, and free, Mirth turn'd the whole house into Comedy; So piercing (where you pleas'd) hitting a fault, That humours from your pen issued all salt. Nor were you thus in Works and Poems knit, As to be but two halfes, and make one wit; But as some things we see, have double cause, And yet the effect it selfe from both whole drawes; So though you were thus twisted and combind As two bodies, to have but one faire minde Yet if we praise you rightly, we must say Both joyn'd, and both did wholly make the Play, For that you could write singly, we may guesse By the divided peeces which the Presse Hath severally sent forth; nor were gone so (Like some our Moderne Authors) made to go On meerely by the helpe of th'other, who To purchase fame do come forth one of two; Nor wrote you so, that one's part was to lick The other into shape, nor did one stick The others cold inventions with such wit, As served like spice, to make them quick and fit; Nor out of mutuall want, or emptinesse, Did you conspire to go still twins to th'Presse: But what thus joyned you wrote, might have come forth As good from each, and stored with the same worth That thus united them, you did joyne sense, In you 'twas League, in others impotence; And the Presse which both thus amongst us sends, Sends us one Poet in a paire of friends. Jasper Maine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the report of the printing of the Dramaticall Poems of Master John Fletcher, collected before, and now set forth in one Volume. Though when all Fletcher writ, and the entire Man was indulged unto that sacred fire, His thoughts, and his thoughts dresse, appeared both such, That 'twas his happy fault to do too much; Who therefore wisely did submit each birth To knowing Beaumont e're it did come forth, Working againe untill he said 'twas fit, And made him the sobriety of his wit; Though thus he call'd his Judge into his fame, And for that aid allow'd him halfe the name, 'Tis knowne, that sometimes he did stand alone, That both the Spunge and Pencill were his owne; That himselfe judged himselfe, could singly do, And was at last Beaumont and Fletcher too; Else we had lost his Shepherdesse, a piece Even and smooth, spun from a finer fleece, Where softnesse raignes, where passions passions greet, Gentle and high, as floods of Balsam meet. Where dress'd in white expressions, sit bright Loves, Drawne, like their fairest Queen, by milkie Doves; A piece, which Johnson in a rapture bid Come up a glorifi'd Worke, and so it did. Else had his Muse set with his friend; the Stage Had miss'd those Poems, which yet take the Age; The world had lost those rich exemplars, where Art, Language, Wit, sit ruling in one Spheare, Where the fresh matters soare above old Theames, As Prophets Raptures do above our Dreames; Where in a worthy scorne he dares refuse All other Gods, and makes the thing his Muse; Where he calls passions up, and layes them so, As spirits, aw'd by him to come, and go; Where the free Author did what e're he would, And nothing will'd, but what a Poet should. No vast uncivill bulke swells any Scene, The strength's ingenious, and the vigour cleane; None can prevent the Fancy, and see through At the first opening; all stand wondring how The thing will be untill it is; which thence With fresh delight still cheate, still takes the sence; The whole designe, the shadowes, the lights such That none can say he shewes or hides too much: Businesse growes up, ripened by just encrease, And by as just degrees againe doth cease, The heats and minutes of affaires are watcht, And the nice points of time are met, and snatcht: Nought later then it should, nought comes before, Chymists, and Calculators doe erre more: Sex, age, degree, affections, country, place, The inward substance, and the outward face; All kept precisely, all exactly fit, What he would write, he was before he writ. 'Twixt Johnsons grave, and Shakespeares lighter sound His muse so steer'd that something still was found, Nor this, nor that, nor both, but so his owne, That 'twas his marke, and he was by it knowne. Hence did he take true judgements, hence did strike All pallates some way, though not all alike: The god of numbers might his numbers crowne, And listning to them wish they were his owne. Thus welcome forth, what ease, or wine, or wit Durst yet produce, that is, what Fletcher writ.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Another. Fletcher, though some call it thy fault, that wit So overflow'd thy scenes, that ere 'twas fit To come upon the Stage, Beaumont was faine To bid thee be more dull, that's write againe, And bate some of thy fire, which from thee came In a cleare, bright, full, but too large a flame; And after all (finding thy Genius such) That blunted, and allayed, 'twas yet too much; Added his sober spunge, and did contract Thy plenty to lesse wit to make't exact: Yet we through his corrections could see Much treasure in thy super fluity, Which was so fil'd away, as when we doe Cut Jewels, that that's lost is jewell too: Or as men use to wash Gold, which we know By losing makes the streame thence wealthy grow: They who doe on thy workes severely fit, And call thy store the over-births of wit, Say thy miscarriages were rare, and when Thou wert superfluous, that thy fruitfull Pen Had no fault but abundance, which did lay Out in one Scene what might well serve a Play; And hence doe grant, that what they call excesse Was to be reckon'd as thy happinesse, From whom wit issued in a full spring-tide; Much did inrich the Stage, much flow'd beside. For that thou couldst thine owne free fancy binde In stricter numbers, and run so confin'd As to observe the rules of Art, which sway In the contrivance of a true borne Play: These winkes proclaime which thou didst write retired From Beaumont, by none but thy selfe inspired; Where we see 'twas not chance that made them hit, Nor were thy Playes the Lotteries of wit, But like to Durers Pencill, which first knew The lawes of faces, and then faces drew: Thou knowst the aire, the colour, and the place, The simetry, which gives a Poem grace: Parts are so fitted unto parts, as doe Shew thou hadst wit, and Mathematicks too: Knewst where by line to spare, where to dispence, And didst beget just Comedies from thence: Things unto which thou didst such life bequeath, That they (their owne Black-Friers) unacted breath. Johnson hath writ things lasting, and divine, Yet his Love-Scenes, Fletcher, compar'd to thine, Are cold and frosty, and exprest love so, As heat with Ice, or warme fires mixt with Snow; Thou, as if struck with the same generous darts, Which burne, and raigne in noble Lovers hearts, Hast cloath'd affections in such native tires, And so describ'd them in their owne true fires; Such moving sighes, such undissembled teares, Such charmes of language, such hopes mixt with feares, Such grants after dentalls, such pursuits After despaire, such amorous recruits. That some who sate spectators have confest Themselves transform'd to what they saw exprest, And felt such shafts steak through their captiv'd sence, As made them rise Parts, and goe Lovers thence. Nor was thy stile wholly compos'd of Groves, Or the soft straines of Shepheards and their Loves; When thou wouldst Comick be, each smiling birth In that kinde, came into the world all mirth, All point, all edge, all sharpnesse; we did sit Sometimes five. Acts out in pure sprightfull wit, Which flowed in such true salt, that we did doubt In which Scene we laught most two shillings out. Shakespeare to thee was dull, whose best jest lyes I'th Ladies questions, and the Fooles replyes; Old fashion'd wit, which walkt from town to town In turn'd Hose, which our fathers call'd the Clown; Whose wit our nice times would obsceannesse call, And which made Bawdry passe for Comicall: Nature was all his Art, toy veine was free As his, but without his scurility; From whom mirth came unforc'd, no jest perplext, But without labour cleane, chast, and unvext. Thou wert not like some, our small Poets who Could not be Poets, were not we Poets too; Whose wit is pilfring, and whose veine and wealth In Poetry lyes meerely in their stealth; Nor didst thou feele their drought, their pangs, their qualmes, Their rack in writing, who doe write for almes, Whose wretched Genius, and dependent fires, But to their Benefactors dole aspires. Nor hadst thou the sly trick, thy selfe to praise Under thy friends names, or to purchase Bayes Didst write stale commendations to thy Booke, Which we for Beaumonts or Ben. Johnsons tooke: That debt thou left'st to us, which none but he Can truly pay, Fletcher, who writes like thee. William Cartwright.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Upon Master Fletchers Incomparable Playes. Apollo sings, his harpe resounds; give roome, For now behold the golden Pompe is come, Thy Pompe of Playes which thousands come to see, With admiration both of them and thee, O Volume worthy leafe, by leafe and cover To be with juice of Cedar washt all over; Here's words with lines, and lines with Scenes consent, To raise an Act to full astonishment; Here melting numbers, words of power to move Young men to swoone, and Maides to dye for love. Love lyes a bleeding here, Evadne there Swells with brave rage, yet comely every where, Here's a mad lover, there that high designe Of King and no King (and the rare Plott thine) So that when 'ere wee circumvolve our Eyes, Such rich, such fresh, such sweet varietyes, Ravish our spirits, that entranc't wee see None writes lov's passion in the world, like Thee. Rob. Herrick.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the happy Collection of Master FLETCHER'S Works, never before Printed. Fletcher arise, Usurpers share thy Bayes, They Canton thy vast Wit to build small Playes: He comes! his Volume breaks through clowds and dust, Downe, little Witts, Ye must refund, Ye must. Nor comes he private, here's great BEAUMONT too, How could one single World encompasse Two? For these Co-heirs had equall power to teach All that all Witts both can and cannot reach. Shakespear was early up, and went so drest As for those dawning houres he knew was best; But when the Sun shone forth, You Two thought fit To weare just Robes, and leave off Trunk-hose-Wit. Now, now 'twas Perfect; None must looke for New, Manners and Scenes may alter, but not You; For Yours are not meere Humours, gilded straines; The Fashion lost, Your massy Sense remaines Some thinke Your VVitts of two Complexions fram'd, That One the Sock, th'Other the Buskin claim'd; That should the Stage embattaile all it's Force, FLETCHER would lead the Foot, BEAUMONT the Horse. But, you were Both for Both; not Semi-witts, Each Piece is wholly Two, yet never splits: Y'are not Two Faculties (and one Soule still) He th'Understanding, Thou the quick free Will; But, as two Voyces in one Song embrace, (FLETCHER'S keen Trebble, and deep BEAUMONTS Base) Two, full, Congeniall Soules; still Both prevail'd; His Muse and Thine were Quarter'd, not Impal'd: Both brought Your Ingots, Both toil'd at the Mint, Beat, melted, sifted, till no drosse stuck in't, Then in each Others scales weigh'd every graine, Then smooth'd and burnish'd, then weigh'd all againe, Stampt Both your Names upon't at one bold Hit, Then, then 'twas Coyne, as well as Bullion-Wit. Thus Twinns: But as when Fate one Eye deprives, That other strives to double which survives: So BEAVMONT dy'd: yet left in Legacy His Rules and Standard-wit (FLETCHER) to Thee. Still the same Planet, though not fill'd so soon, A Two-horn'd Crescent then, now one Full-moon. Joynt Love before, now Honour doth provoke; So th'old Twin-Giants forcing a huge Oake One slipp'd his footing, th'Other sees him fall, Grasp'd the whole Tree and single held up all. Imperiall FLETCHER! here begins thy Raigne, Scenes flow like Sun-beams from thy glorious Brain; Thy swift dispatching Soule no more doth stay Then He that built two Citties in one day; Ever brim full, and sometimes running o're To feede poore languid VVitts that waite at doore, VVho creep and creep, yet ne're above-ground stood, (For Creatures have most Feet which have least Blood) But thou art still that Bird of Paradise VVhich hath no feet and ever nobly flies: Rich, lusty Sence, such as the Poet ought, For Poems if not Excellent, are Naught; Low wit in Scenes? in state a Peasant goes; If meane and flat, let it foot Yeoman Prose, That such may spell as are not Readers grown, To whom He that writes VVit, shews he hath none. Brave Shakespeare flow'd, yet had his Ebbing too, Often above Himselfe, sometimes below; Thou Alwayes Best; if ought seem'd to decline, 'Twas the unjudging Rout's mistake, not Thine: Thus thy faire SHEPHEARDESSE, which the bold Heape (False to Themselves and Thee) did prize so cheap, VVas found (when understood) fit to be Crown'd, At worst 'twas worth two hundred thousand pound. Some blast thy Works lest we should track their VValke Where they steale all those few good things they talke; Wit-Burglary must chide those it feeds on, For Plunder'd folkes ought to be rail'd upon; But (as stoln goods goe off at halfe their worth) Thy strong Sence pall's when they purloine it forth. When did'st Thou borrow? where's the man e're read Ought begg'd by Thee from those Alive or Dead? Or from dry Goddesses, as some who when They stuffe their page with Godds, write worse then Men. Thou was't thine owne Muse, and hadst such vast odds Thou out-writ'st him whose verse made all those Godds: Surpassing those our Dwarfish Age up reares, As much as Greeks or Latines thee in yeares: Thy Ocean Fancy knew nor Bankes nor Damms, VVe ebbe downe dry to pebble-Anagrams; Dead and insipid, all despairing fit Lost to behold this great Relapse of VVit: What strength remaines, is like that (wilde and fierce) Till Iohnson made good Poets and right Verse. Such boyst'rous Trifles Thy Muse would not brooke, Save when she'd show how scurvily they looke; No savage Metaphors (things rudely Great) Thou dost display, not butcher a Conceit; Thy Nerves have Beauty, which Invades and Charms; Lookes like a Princesse harness'd in bright Armes. Nor art Thou Loud and Cloudy; those that do Thunder so much, do't without Lightning too; Tearing themselves, and almost split their braine To render harsh what thou speak'st free and cleane; Such gloomy Sense may passe for High and Proud, But true-born VVit still flies above the Cloud; Thou knewst 'twas Impotence what they call Height; Who blusters strong i'th Darke, but creeps it'h Light. And as thy thoughts were cleare, so, Innocent; Thy Phancy gave no unswept Language vent; Slaunderst not Lawes, prophan'st no holy Page, (As if thy Fathers Crosier aw'd the Stage;) High Crimes were still arraign'd, though they made shift To prosper out foure Acts, were plagu'd i'th Fift: All's safe, and wise; no stiffe-affected Scene, Nor swoln, nor flat, a True Full Naturall veyne; Thy Sence (like well-drest Ladies) cloath'd as skinn'd, Not all unlac'd, nor City-startcht and pinn'd Thou hadst no Sloath, no Rage, no sullen Fit, But Strengh and Mirth, FLETCHER'S a Sanguin VVit. Thus, two great Consul-Poets all things swayd, Till all was English Borne or English Made: Miter and Coyfe here into One Piece spun, BEAVMONT a Judge's, This a Prelat's sonne. What strange Production is at last displaid, (Got by Two Fathers, without Female aide) Behold, two Masculines espous'd each other, Wit and the World were born without a Mother. I. Berkenhead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the memorie of Master FLETCHER. There's nothing gain'd by being witty: Fame Gathers but winde to blather up a name. Orpheus must leave his lyre, or if it be In heav'n, 'tis there a signe, no harmony; And stones, that follow'd him, may now become Now stones againe, and serve him for his Tomb. The Theban Linus, that was ably skil'd In Muse and Musicke, was by PhÅbus kill'd, Though PhÅbus did beget him: sure his Art Had merited his balsame, not his dart. But here Apollo's jealousie is seene, The god of Physicks troubled with the spleene; Like timerous Kings he puts a period To high grown parts lest he should be no God. Hence those great Master-wits of Greece that gave Life to the world, could not avoid a grave. Hence the inspired Prophets of old Rome Too great for earth fled to Elizium. But the same Ostracisme benighted one, To whom all these were but illusion; It tooke our Fletcher hence, Fletcher, whose wit Was not an accident to th'soule, but It; Onely diffus'd. (Thus wee the same Sun call, Moving it'h SphÃ¦re, and shining on a wall.) Wit, so high plac'd at first, it could not climbe, Wit, that ne're grew, but only show'd by time. No fier-worke of sacke, no seldome show'n Poeticke rage, but still in motion: And with far more then SphÃ¦ricke excellence It mov'd, for 'twas its owne Intelligence. And yet so obvious to sense, so plaine, You'd scarcely thinke't ally'd unto the braine: So sweete, it gain'd more ground upon the Stage Then Johnson with his selfe-admiring rage Ere lost: and then so naturally it fell, That fooles would think, that they could doe as well. This is our losse: yet spight of PhÅbus, we Will keepe our Fletcher, for his wit is He. Edw. Powell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vpon the ever to be admired Mr. John Fletcher and His PLAYES. What's all this preparation for? or why Such suddain Triumphs? Fletcher the people cry! Just so, when Kings approach, our Conduits run Claret, as here the spouts slow Helicon; See, every sprightfull Muse dress'd trim and gay Strews hearbs and scatters roses in his way. Thus th'outward yard set round with bayes w'have seene, Which from the garden hath transplanted been: Thus, at the PrÃ¦tor's feast, with needlesse costs Some must b'employd in painting of the posts: And some as dishes made for sight, not taste, Stand here as things for shew to Fletchers feast. Oh what an honour! what a Grace 'thad beene T'have had his Cooke in Rollo serv'd them in! Fletcher the King of Poets? such was he, That earn'd all tribute, claim'd all soveraignty; And may be that denye's it, learn to blush At's loyall Subject, starve at's Beggars bush: And if not drawn by example, shame, nor Grace, Turne o're to's Coxcomb, and the Wild-goose Chase Monarch of Wit! great Magazine of wealth! From whose rich Banke, by a Promethean-stealth, Our lesser flames doe blaze! His the true fire, When they like Glo-worms, being touch'd, expire. 'Twas first beleev'd, because he alwayes was, The Ipse dixit, and Pythagoras To our Disciple-wits; His soule might run (By the same-dream't-of Transmigration) Into their rude and indigested braine, And so informe their Chaos-lump againe; For many specious brats of this last age Spoke Fletcher perfectly in every Page. This rowz'd his Rage to be abused thus: Made's Lover mad, Lieutenant humerous. Thus Ends of Gold and Silver-men are made (As th'use to say) Goldsmiths of his owne trade; Thus Rag-men from the dung-hill often hop, And publish forth by chance a Brokers shop: But by his owne light, now, we have descri'd The drosse, from that hath beene so purely tri'd. Proteus of witt! who reads him doth not see The manners of each sex of each degree! His full stor'd fancy doth all humours fill From th'Queen of Corinth to the maid o'th mill. His Curate, Lawyer, Captain, Prophetesse Shew he was all and every one of these; Hee taught (so subtly were their fancies seiz'd) To Rule a Wife, and yet the Women pleas'd. Parnassus is thine owne, Claime't as merit, Law makes the Elder Brother to inherit. G. Hills.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">IN HONOUR OF Mr John Fletcher. So Fletcher now presents to fame His alone selfe and unpropt name, As Rivers Rivers entertaine, But still fall single into th'maine, So doth the Moone in Consort shine Yet flowes alone into its mine, And though her light be joyntly throwne, When she makes silver tis her owne: Perhaps his quill flew stronger, when Twas weaved with his Beaumont's pen; And might with deeper wonder hit, It could not shew more his, more wit; So Hercules came by sexe and Love, When Pallas sprang from single Jove; He tooke his Beaumont for Embrace, Not to grow by him, and increase, Nor for support did with him twine, He was his friends friend, not his vine. His witt with witt he did not twist To be Assisted, but t'Assist. And who could succour him, whose quill Did both Run sense and sense Distill? Had Time and Art in't, and the while Slid even as theirs wh'are only style, Whether his chance did cast it so Or that it did like Rivers flow Because it must, or whether twere A smoothnesse from his file and eare, Not the most strict enquiring nayle Cou'd e're finde where his piece did faile Of entyre onenesse; so the frame, Was Composition, yet the same. How does he breede his Brother? and Make wealth and estate understand? Sutes Land to wit, makes Lucke match merit, And makes an Eldest fitly inherit: How was he Ben, when Ben did write Toth' stage, not to his judge endite? How did he doe what Johnson did, And Earne what Johnson wou'd have s'ed? Jos. Howe of Trin. Coll. Oxon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Master John Fletcher his dramaticall Workes now at last printed. I could prayse Heywood now: or tell how long, Falstaffe from cracking Nuts hath kept the throng: But for a Fletcher, I must take an Age, And scarce invent the Title for one Page. Gods must create new SphÃ¦res, that should expresse The sev'rall Accents, Fletcher, of thy Dresse: The Penne of Fates should only write thy Praise: And all Elizium for thee turne to Bayes. Thou feltst no pangs of Poetry, such as they, Who the Heav'ns quarter still before a Play, And search the Ephemerides to finde, When the Aspect for Poets will be kinde. Thy Poems (sacred Spring) did from thee flow, With as much pleasure, as we reade them now. Nor neede we only take them up by fits, When love or Physicke hath diseas'd our Wits; Or constr'e English to untye a knot, Hid in a line, farre subtler then the Plot. With Thee the Page may close his Ladies eyes, And yet with thee the serious Student Rise: The Eye at sev'rall angles darting rayes, Makes, and then sees, new Colours; so thy Playes To ev'ry vnderstanding still appeare, As if thou only meant'st to take that Eare; The Phrase so terse and free of a just Poise, Where ev'ry word ha's weight and yet no Noise, The matter too so nobly fit, no lesse Then such as onely could deserve thy Dresse: Witnesse thy Comedies, Pieces of such worth, All Ages shall still like, but ne're bring forth. Other in season last scarce so long time, As cost the Poet but to make the Rime: Where, if a Lord a new way do's but spit, Or change his shrugge this antiquates the Wit. That thou didst live before, nothing would tell Posterity, could they but write so well. Thy Cath'lick Fancy will acceptance finde, Not whilst an humour's living, bvt Man-kinde. Thou, like thy Writings, Innocent and Cleane, Ne're practis'd a new Vice, to make one Sceane, None of thy Inke had gall, and Ladies can, Securely heare thee sport without a Fanne. But when Thy Tragicke Muse would please to rise In Majestie, and call Tribute from our Eyes; Like Scenes, we shifted Passions, and that so, Who only came to see, turn'd Actors too. How didst thou sway the Theatre I make us feele The Players wounds were true, and their swords, steele! Nay, stranger yet, how often did I know When the Spectators ran to save the blow? Frozen with griefe we could not stir away Vntill the Epilogue told us 'twas a Play. What shall I doe? all Commendations end, In saying only thou wert Beaumonts Friend? Give me thy spirit quickely, for I swell, And like a raveing Prophetesse cannot tell How to receive thy Genius in my breast: Oh! I must sleepe, and then I'le sing the rest. T. Palmer of Ch. Ch. Oxon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the unparalelld Playes written by those Renowned Twinnes of Poetry Beaumont &amp; Fletcher. What's here? another Library of prayse, Met in a Troupe t'advance contemned Playes, And bring exploded Witt againe in fashion? I can't but wonder at this Reformation. My skipping soule surfets with so much good, To see my hopes into fruition budd. A happy Chimistry! blest viper, joy! That through thy mothers bowels gnawst thy way! Witts flock in sholes, and clubb to re-erect Inspight of Ignorance the Architect Of Occidentall Poesye; and turne Godds, to recall witts ashes from their urne. Like huge Collosses they've together mett Their shoulders, to support a world of Witt. The tale of Atlas (though of truth it misse) We plainely read Mythologiz'd in this; Orpheus and Amphion whose undying stories Made Athens famous, are but Allegories. Tis Poetry has pow'r to civilize Men, worse then stones, more blockish then the Trees I cannot chuse but thinke (now things so fall) That witt is past its Climactericall; And though the Muses have beene dead and gone I know they'll finde a Resurrection. Tis vaine to prayse; they're to themselves a glory, And silence is our sweetest Oratory. For he that names but Fletcher must needs be Found guilty of a loud hyperbole. His fancy so transcendently aspires, He showes himselfe a witt, who but admires. Here are no volumes stuft with cheverle sence, The very Anagrams of Eloquence, Nor long-long-winded sentences that be, Being rightly spelld, but Witts Stenographie. Nor words, as voyd of Reason, as of Rithme, Only cÃ¦sura'd to spin out the time. But heer's a Magazine of purest sence Cloath'd in the newest Garbe of Eloquence. ScÃ¦nes that are quick and sprightly, in whose veines Bubbles the quintessence of sweet-high straines. Lines like their Authours, and each word of it Does say twas writ b'a Gemini of Witt. How happie is our age! how blest our men! When such rare soules live themselves o're agen. We erre, that thinke a Poet dyes; for this, Shewes that tis but a Metempsychosis. Beaumont and Fletcher here at last we see Above the reach of dull mortalitie, Or pow'r of fate: &amp; thus the proverbe hitts (That's so much crost) These men live by their witts. Alex. Brome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Death and workes of Mr John Fletcher. My name, so far from great, that tis not knowne, Can lend no praise but what thou'dst blush to own; And no rude hand, or feeble wit should dare To vex thy Shrine with an unlearned teare. I'de have a State of Wit convok'd, which hath A power to take up on common Faith; That when the stocke of the whole Kingdome's spent In but preparatiue to thy Monument, The prudent Councell may invent fresh wayes To get new contribution to thy prayse, And reare it high, and equall to thy Wit Which must give life and Monument to it. So when late Essex dy'd, the Publicke face Wore sorrow in't, and to add mournefull Grace To the sad pomp of his lamented fall, The Common wealth serv'd at his Funerall And by a Solemne Order built his Hearse. But not like thine, built by thy selfe, in Verse, Where thy advanced Image safely stands Above the reach of Sacrilegious hands. Base hands how impotently you disclose Your rage 'gainst Camdens learned ashes, whose Defaced Statua and Martyrd booke, Like an Antiquitie and Fragment looke. Nonnulla desunt's legibly appeare, So truly now Camdens Remaines lye there. Vaine Malice! how he mocks thy rage, while breath Of fame shall speake his great Elizabeth! 'Gainst time and thee he well provided hath, Brittannia is the Tombe and Epitaph. Thus Princes honours; but Witt only gives A name which to succeeding ages lives. Singly we now consult our selves and fame, Ambitious to twist ours with thy great name. Hence we thus bold to praise. For as a Vine With subtle wreath, and close embrace doth twine A friendly Elme, by whose tall trunke it shoots And gathers growth and moysture from its roots; About its armes the thankfull clusters cling Like Bracelets, and with purple ammelling The blew-cheek'd grape stuck in its vernant haire Hangs like rich jewells in a beauteous eare. So grow our Prayses by thy Witt; we doe Borrow support and strength and land but show. And but thy Male wit like the youthfull Sun Strongly begets upon our passion. Making our sorrow teeme with Elegie, Thou yet unwep'd, and yet unprais'd might'st he. But th'are imperfect births; and such are all Produc'd by causes not univocall, The soapes of Nature, Passives being unfit, And hence our verse speakes only Mother wit. Oh for a fit o'th Father! for a Spirit That might but parcell of thy worth inherit; For but a sparke of that diviner sire Which thy full breast did animale and inspire; That Soules could bee divided, thou traduce But a small particle of thine to us! Of thine; which we admir'd when thou didst sit But as a joynt-Commissioner in Wit; When it had plummets hung on to suppresse It's too luxuriant growing mightinesse: Till as that tree which scornes to bee kept downe, Thou grewst to govern the whole Stage alone. In which orbe thy throng'd light did make the star, Thou wert th'Intelligence did move that SphÃ¦re. Thy Fury was compos'd; Rapture no fit That hung on thee; nor thou far gone in witt As men in a disease; thy Phansie cleare, Muse chast, as those frames whence they tooke their fire; No spurious composures amongst thine Got in adultery 'twixt Witt and Wine. And as th'Hermeticall Physitians draw From things that curse of the first-broken Law, That Ens Venenum, which extracted thence Leaves nought but primitive Good and Innocence: So was thy Spirit calcin'd; no Mixtures there But perfect, such as next to Simples are. Not like those Meteor-wits which wildly flye In storme and thunder through th' amazed skie; Speaking but th'Ills and Villanies in a State, Which fooles admire, and wise men tremble at, Full of portent and prodigie, whose Gall Oft scapes the Vice, and on the man doth fall. Nature us'd all her skill, when thee she meant A Wit at once both Great and Innocent. Yet thou hadst Tooth; but 'twas thy judgement, not For mending one word, a whole sheet to blot. Thou couldst anatomize with ready art And skilfull hand crimes lockt close up i'th heart. Thou couldst unfold darke Plots, and shew that path By which Ambition climb'd to Greatnesse hath. Thou couldst the rises, turnes, and falls of States, How neare they were their Periods and Dates; Couldst mad the Subject into popular rage, And the grown seas of that great storme asswage, Dethrone usurping Tyrants, and place there The lawfull Prince and true Inheriter; Knewst all darke turnings in the Labyrinth Of policie, which who but knowes he sinn'th, Save thee, who un-infected didst walke in't As the great Genius of Government. And when thou laidst thy tragicke buskin by To Court the Stage with gentle Comedie, How new, how proper th'humours, how express'd In rich variety, how neatly dress'd In language, how rare Plots, what strength of Wit Shin'd in the face and every limb of it! The Stage grew narrow while thou grewst to be In thy whole life an Exc'llent Comedie. To these a Virgin-modesty which first met Applause with blush and feare, as if he yet Had not deserv'd; till bold with constant praise His browes admitted the unfought for Bayes. Nor would he ravish fame; but left men free To their owne Vote and Ingenuity. When His faire Shepherdesse on the guilty Stage, Was martir'd betweene Ignorance and Rage; At which the impatient Vertues of those few Could judge, grew high, cri'd Murther: though he knew The innocence and beauty of his Childe, Hee only, as if unconcerned, smil'd. Princes have gather'd since each scattered grace, Each line and beauty of that injur'd face; And on th'united parts breath'd such a fire As spight of Malice she shall ne're expire. Attending, not affecting, thus the crowne Till every hand did help to set it on, Hee came to be sole Monarch, and did raign In Wits great Empire, abs'lute Soveraign. John Harris.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On Mr. John Fletcer's ever to be admired Dramaticall Works. I've thought upon't; and thus I may gaine bayes, I will commend thee Fletcher, and thy Playes. But none but Witts can do't, how then can I Come in amongst them, that cou'd ne're come nigh? There is no other way, I'le throng to sit And passe it'h Croud amongst them for a Wit. Apollo knows me not, nor I the Nine, All my pretence to verse is Love and Wine. By your leave Gentlemen. You Wits o'th' age, You that both furnisht have, and judg'd the Stage. You, who the Poet and the Actors fright, Least that your Censure thin the second night: Pray tell me, gallant Wits, could Criticks think There ere was solÃ¦cisme in Fletchers Inke? Or Lapse of Plot, or fancy in his pen? A happinesse not still alow'd to Ben! After of Time and Wit h'ad been at cost He of his owne New-Inne was but an Hoste. Inspir'd, Fletcher! here's no vaine-glorious words: How ev'n thy lines, how smooth thy sense accords. Thy Language so insinuates, each one Of thy spectators has thy passion. Men seeing, valiant; Ladies amorous prove: Thus owe to thee their valour and their Love: Scenes! chaste yet satisfying! Ladies can't say Though Stephen miscarri'd that so did the play: Judgement could ne're to this opinion leane That Lowen, Tailor, ere could grace thy Scene: 'Tis richly good unacted, and to me Thy very Farse appears a Comedy. Thy drollery is designe, each looser part Stuffs not thy Playes, but makes 'em up an Art The Stage has seldome seen; how often vice Is smartly scourg'd to checke us? to initice, How well encourag'd vertue is? how guarded, And, that which makes us love her, how rewarded? Some, I dare say, that did with loose thoughts fit, Reclaim'd by thee, came converts from the pit. And many a she that to be tane up came, Tooke up themselves, and after left the game. Henry Harington.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the memory of the deceased but ever-living Authour in these his Poems, Mr. JOHN FLETCHER. On the large trail of Fletchers friends let me (Retaining still my wonted modesty,) Become a Waited in my ragged verse, As Follower to the Muses Followers. Many here are of Noble ranke and worth, That have, by strength of Art, set Fletcher forth In true and lively colours, as they saw him, And had the best abilities to draw him; Many more are abroad, that write and looke To have their lines set before Fletchers Booke; Some, that have known him too; some more, some lesse; Some onely but by Heare-say, some by Guesse, And some, for fashion-sake, would take the hint To try how well their Wits would shew in Print. You, that are here before me Gentlemen, And Princes of Parnassus by the Penne And your just Judgements of his worth, that have Preserv'd this Authours mem'ry from the Grave, And made it glorious; let me, at your gate, Porter it here, 'gainst those that come too late, And are unfit to enter. Something I Will deserve here: For where you versifie In flowing numbers, lawfull Weight, and Time, I'll write, though not rich Verses, honest Rime. I am admitted. Now, have at the Rowt Of those that would crowd in, but must keepe out. Beare back, my Masters; Pray keepe backe; Forbeare: You cannot, at this time have entrance here. You, that are worthy, may, by intercession, Finde entertainment at the next Impression. But let none then attempt it, that not know The reverence due, which to this shrine they owe: All such must be excluded; and the sort, That onely upon trust, or by report Have taken Fletcher up, and thinke it trim To have their Verses planted before Him: Let them read first his Works, and learne to know him, And offer, then, the Sacrifice they owe him. But farre from hence be such, as would proclaim Their knowledge of this Authour, not his Fame; And such, as would pretend, of all the rest, To be the best Wits that have known him best. Depart hence all such Writers, and, before Inferiour ones, thrust in, by many a score, As formerly, before Tom Coryate, Whose Worke before his Praysers had the Fate To perish: For the witty Coipies tooke Of his Encomiums made themselves a Booke. Here's no such subject for you to out-doe, Out-shine, out-live (though well you may doe too In other Spheres:) For Fletchers flourishing Bayes Must never fade while PhÅbus weares his Rayes. Therefore forbeare to presse upon him thus. Why, what are you (cry some) that prate to us? Doe not we know you for a flashy Meteor? And stil'd (at best) the Muses Serving-creature? Doe you comptroll? Y'have had your Jere: Sirs, no; But, in an humble manner, let you know Old Serving-creatures oftentimes are fit T'informe young Masters, as in Land, in Wit, What they inherit; and how well their Dads Left one, and wish'd the other to their Lads. And from departed Poets I can guesse Who has a greater share of Wit, who lesse. 'Way Foole, another says. I, let him raile, And 'bout his own eares flourish his Wit-flayle, Till with his Swingle be his Noddle breake; While this of Fletcher and his Works I speake: His Works (says Momus) nay, his Plays you'd say: Thou hast said right, for that to him was Play Which was to others braines a toyle: with ease He playd on Waves which were Their troubled Seas. His nimble Births have longer liv'd then theirs That have, with strongest Labour, divers yeeres Been sending forth the issues of their Braines Upon the Stage; and shall to th'Stationers gaines Life after life take, till some After-age Shall put down Printing, as this doth the Stage; Which nothing now presents unto the Eye, But in Dumb-shews her own sad Tragedy. 'Would there had been no sadder Works abroad, Since her decay, acted in Fields of Blood. But to the Man againe, of whom we write, The Writer that made Writing his Delight, Rather then Worke. He did not pumpe, nor drudge, To beget Wit, or manage it; nor trudge To Wit conventions with Note-booke, to gleane Or steale some Jests to foist into a Scene: He scorn'd those shifts You, that have known him, knew The common talke that from his Lips did flow, And run at waste, did savour more of Wit, Then any of his time, or since have writ, (But few excepted) in the Stages way: His Scenes were Acts, and every Act a Play. I knew him in his strength; even then, when He That was the Master of his Art and Me Most knowing Johnson (proud to call him Sonne) In friendly Envy swore, He had out-done His very Selfe, I knew him till he dyed; And, at his dissolution, what a Tide Of sorrow overwhelm'd the Stage; which gave Valleys of sighes to send him to his grave. And grew distracted in most violent Fits (For She had lost the best part of her Wits.) In the first yeere, our famous Fletcher fell, Of good King Charles who grac'd these Poems well, Being then in life of Action: But they dyed Since the Kings absence; or were layd aside, As is their Poet. Now at the Report Of the Kings second comming to his Court, The Bookes creepe from the Presse to Life not Action, Crying unto the World, that no protraction May hinder Sacred Majesty to give Fletcher, in them, leave on the Stage to live. Others may more in lofty Verses move; I onely, thus, expresse my Truth and Love. Ric. Brome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Upon the Printing of Mr. Iohn Fletchers workes. What meanes this numerous Guard? or do we come To file our Names or Verse upon the Tombe Of Fletcher, and by boldly making knowne His Wit, betray the Nothing of our Owne? For if we grant him dead, it is as true Against our selves, No Wit, no Poet now; Or if he be returnd from his coole shade, To us, this Booke his Resurrection's made, We bleed our selves to death, and but contrive By our owne Epitaphs to shew him alive. But let him live and let me prophesie, As I goe Swan-like out, Our Peace is nigh; A Balme unto the wounded Age I sing, And nothing now is wanting but the King. Ja. Shirley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE STATIONER. As after th'Epilogue there comes some one To tell Spectators what shall next be shown; So here, am I; but though I've toyld and vext, 'Cannot devise what to present 'ye next; For, since ye saw no Playes this Cloudy weather, Here we have brought Ye our whole Stock together. 'Tis new, and all these Gentlemen attest Under their hands 'tis Right, and of the Best; Thirty foure Witnesses (without my taske) Y'have just so many Playes (besides a Maske) All good (I'me told) as have been Read or Playd, If this Booke faile, tis time to quit the Trade.

      <field name="fulltext">POSTCRIPT. We forgot to tell the Reader, that some Prologues and Epilogues (here inserted) were not written by the Authours of this Volume; but made by others on the Revivall of severall Playes. After the Comedies and Tragedies were wrought off, we were forced (for expedition) to send the Gentlemens Verses to severall Printers, which was the occasion of their different Character; but the Worke it selfe is one continued Letter, which (though very legible) is none of the biggest, because (as much as possible) we would lessen the Bulke of the Volume.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima. Flourish. Enter Astorax King of Paphos, his Sister Calis, traine, and Cleanthe, Lucippe Gentlewomen at one doore; At the other Eumenes a Souldier. Eumen. Health to my Soveraigne. King. Eumenes, welcome: Welcome to Paphos souldier to our love, And that faire health ye wish us through the Campe May it disperse it selfe, and make all happy; How does the Generall, the valiant Memnon, And how his wars, Eumenes? Eume. The Gods have giv'n you (royall Sir) a Souldier Better ne're sought a danger, more approv'd In way of war, more master of his fortunes, Expert in leading 'em; in doing valiant, In following all his deeds to Victories, And holding fortune certaine there. King. O Souldier, Thou speak'st a man indeed; a Generall Generall, A soule conceiv'd a Souldier. Eumen. Ten set Battells Against the strong usurper Diocles Whom long experience had begot a Leader Ambition rais'd too mighty: hath your Memnon Won, and won gloriously, distrest and shooke him Even from the head of all his hopes to nothing: In three he beat the thunder-bolt his brother Forc'd him to wall himselfe up: there not safe, Shooke him with warlike Engines like an earthquake, Till like a snaile he left his shell and crawl'd By night, and hidious darknesse to destruction: Disarm'd for ever rising more; twelve Castles, Some though impregnable; Townes twice as many Countries that like the wind knew no command But savage wildnesse; hath this Generall With losse of blood &amp; youth, through storms &amp; tempests Cal'd to your faire obedience. Drum within. King. O my Souldier That thou wert now within my arms; what drumsâ Drum Are those that beat Eumenes? Eumen. His my Soveraigne; Himselfe i'th' head of conquest drawing home, An old man now to offer up his glories, And endlesse conquest at your shrine. King. Goe all, And entertaine him with all Ceremonie, Wee'le keep him now a Courtier. Eumen. Sir, a strange one, Pray God his language beare it; by my life, Sir He knowes no complement, nor curious casting Of words into fit places ere he speak 'em, He can say fight well fellow, and i'le thanke thee: He that must eat, must sweat; bring up the reare there. Or charge that wing of horse home. Florish. King. Goe too, goe too. Ent. Memnon and a traine of Courtiers &amp; souldiers, two Captains, Chilax. Valiant and wise are twins Sir: welcome, welcome, Welcome my fortunate and famous Generall, High in thy Princes favour as in fame, Welcome to Peace and Paphos. Mem. Thanke your Grace, And would to God my dull tongue had that sweetnesse To thanke you as I should; but pardon me, My sword and I speake roughly Sir: your battells I dare well say, I have fought well; for I bring ye That lazie end you wish for Peace, so fully, That no more name of war is: who now thinkes Sooner or safer these might have bin ended. Begin 'em lf ye dare againe; I'le thanke him. Souldier and Souldiers Mate these twenty five yeares, At length your Generall, (as one whose merit Durst looke upon no lesse,) I have waded through Dangers would damp't these soft soules, but to heare of The maidenheads of thousand lives hangs here Sir, Since which time, Prince, I know no Court but Marshall, No oylie language, but the shock of Armes, No dalliance but with death; No lofty measures But weary and sad marches, cold and hunger, Larums at midnight, Valours selfe would shake at, Yet I ne're shrunke. Balls of consuming Wildfire, That lickt men up like lightning, have I laught at, And tost 'em back againe like childrens trifles Upon the edges of my Enemies swords I have marcht like whirle-windes, fury at this hand waiting, Death at my right; Fortune my forlorne hope, When I have grapled with destruction, And tug'd with pale fac'd Ruine, Night and Mischiefe, Frighted to see a new day breake in bloud, And every where I conquer'd; and for you sir, Mothers have wanted wombes to make me famous. And blowne ambition dangers; Those that griev'd ye, I have taken order for i'th' earth: those fooles That shall hereafter. K. No more wars my souldier: K. takes Mem. aside and talkes with him. We must now treat of peace sir. Clean. How he talkes, How gloriously. Cal. A goodly timber'd fellow, Valiant no doubt. Cle. If valour dwell in vaunting; In what a phrase he speakes as if his actions Could be set of in nothing but a noise, Sure has a drum in's mouth. Cal. I wonder wenches How he would speake to us. Clean. Nothing but larum Tell us whose throat he cut, shew us his sword, And blesse it for sure biting. Lucippe. And't like your Grace, I doe not thinke he knowes us what we are, Or to what end; for I have heard his followers Affirme he never saw a woman that exceeded A Sutlers wife yet, or in execution Old bedrid Beldames without teeth or tongues, That would not flie his furie? how he lookes. Clean. This way devoutly. Cal. Sure his Lordship's viewing Our Fortifications. Lucip. If he mount at me, I may chance choake his Battery. Cal. Still his eye Keeps quarter this way: Uenus grant his valour Be not in love. Clean. If he be, presently Expect a Herrald and a Trompet with ye To bid ye render; we two Perdu's pay for't else. King. I'le leave ye to my sister, and these Ladies To make your welcome fuller: my good souldier We must now turne your sternnesse into Courtship When ye have done there; to your fair repose sir: Florish. I know you need it Memnon, welcome gentlemen. Ex. Ki. Luci. Now he begins to march: Madam the Van's yours, Keep your ground sure; 'tis for your spurrs. Mem. O Venus. He kneeles amaz'd and forgets to speake. Cal. How he stares on me. Clean. Knight him Madam, knight him He will grow tooth' ground els. Eumenes. Speake sir, 'tis the Princesse. 1 Capt. Ye shame your selfe, speake to her Cal. Rise and speake sir. Ye are welcome to the Court, to me, to all sir, Lucip. Is he not deafe? Cal. The Gentleman's not well. Eumen. Fie noble Generall. Lucip. Give him fresh aire his colour goes, how do ye? The Princesse will be glad sir. Mem. Peace, and heare me. Clean. Command a silence there. Mem. I love thee Lady. Cal. I thank your Lordship heartily: proceed sir. Lucip. Lord how it stuck in's stomack like a surfet. Clean. It breaks apace now from him, God be thanked, What a fine spoken man he is. Lucip. A choice one of singular variety in carriage. Clean. Yes and I warrant you he knows his distance. Mem. With all my heart I love thee. Cal. A hearty gentleman, And I were eene an arrand beast, my Lord, But I lov'd you againe. Mem. Good Lady kisse me. Clean. I marry, Mars, there thou cam'st close up to her. Cal. Kiss you at first my Lord, 'tis no faire fashion, Our lips are like Rose buds, blowne with mens breaths, They loose both sap and savour; there's my hand sir. Eumen. Fie, fie, my Lord, this is too rude. Mem. Unhand me, Consume me if I hurt her; good sweet Lady Let me but looke upon thee. Cal. Doe. Mem. Yet. Cal. Well sir. Take your full view. Lucip. Blesse your eyes sir. Cal. Mercie, Is this the man they talkt of for a souldier, So absolute and Excellent: O the Gods, If I were given to that vanitie Of making sport with men for ignorance, What a most precious subject had I purchas'd? Speake for him gentlemen: some one that knowes, What the man ailes; and can speake sense. Clean. Sure Madam, This fellow has been a rare Hare finder See how his eyes are set. Cal. Some one goe with me, I'le send him something, for his head, poore gentleman, Is troubled with the staggers. Lucip. Keep him darke, He will run March mad else, the fumes of Battell's Ascend into his braines, Clean. Clap to his feet An old Drum head, to draw the thunder downward. Cal. Look to him gentlemen: farwell, Lord I am sorry We cannot kisse at this time, but believe it Wee'le find an houre for all: God keep my children, From being such sweet Souldiers; Softly wenches, Lest we disturbe his dreame. Exit Calis &amp; Ladies. Eumen. Why this is Monstrous. 1 Capt. A strange forgetfulnesse, yet still he holds it. 2 Capt. Though he ne're saw a woman of great fashion Before this day, yet my thinks 'tis possible He might imagine what they are, and what Belongs unto 'em; meere report of others. Eumen. Pish, his head had other whimsies in't: my Lord, Death I think y'are strook dumb; my good Lord Generall 1 Capt. Sir. Mem. That I doe love ye Madam; and so love ye An't like your grace. 2 Cap. He has bin studying this speech. Eumen. Who doe ye speake to sir. Mem. Why where's the Lady The woman, the faire woman. 1 Cap. Who? Mem. The Princesse, Give me the Princesse. Eumen. Give yee counsell rather To use her like a Princesse: Fy my Lord, How have you borne your selfe, how nakedly Laid your soule open: and your ignorance To be a sport to all; report and honour: Drew her to doe you favours, and you bluntly, Without consideration what, or how she was Neither collecting reason, nor distinction. Mem. Why, what did I my masters? Eumen. All that shewes A man unhandsome, undigested done. Mem. Did not I kneele unto her? Eumen. Dumbe and senslesse, As though ye had bin cut out for your fathers tombe, Or stuck a land-marke; when she spoke unto you, Being the excellence of all our Island, Ye star'd upon her, as ye had seene a monster Mem. Was I so foolish; I confesse Eumenes, I never saw before so brave an outside But did I kneele so long Eumen. Till they laught at ye, And when you spoke, I am asham'd to tell ye What 'twas my Lord; how farre from order; Blesse me, is't possible the wild noise of a warre And what she only teaches should possesse ye, Knowledge to treat with her, and full discretion Being at flood still in ye, and in peace, And manly conversation smooth and civill, Where gracefulnesse and glory twyn together Thrust your selfe out an exile? Doe you know sir, what state she carries? What great obedience waits at her backe continually? Mem. She ne're commanded A hundred thousand men, as I have done, Nor ne're won battell; Say I would have kist her. Eume. There was a dainty offer too, a rare one. Mem. Why, she is a woman, is she not? Eume. She is so. Mem. Why, very well; what was she made for then? Is she not young and handsome bred to breed? Doe not men kisse faire women? if they doe, If lips be not unlawfull ware; Why a Princesse Is got the same way that we get a begger, Or I am cosen'd; and the selfe-same way Shee must be handled e're she get another, That's rudenesse is it not? 2. Cap. To her 'tis held so, &amp; rudnes in that high degree. Mem. 'Tis reason, But I will be more punctuall; pray what thought she? Eum. Her thoughts were mercifull, but she laught at ye, Pittying the poorenesse of your complement, And so she left ye, good sir shape your selfe To understand the place, and noble persons You live with now. 1. Cap. Let not those great deserts The King hath layd up of ye, and the people, Be blasted with ill bearing. Eume. The whole name of souldier, then will suffer. Mem. Shee's a sweet one, And good sirs leave your exhortations They come untimely to me, I have braines That beate above your reaches: Shee's a Princesse, That's all: I have killed a King, that's greater. Come let's to dinner, if the Wine be good, You shall perceive strange wisdome in my blood. Exeunt all but Chilax. Chil. Well, would thou wert i'the wars again Old Memnon, there thou wouldst talke toth' purpose, And the proudest of all these Court Camelions Would be glad to find it sense too: plague of this Dead peace, this bastard breeding lowzie lazie idlenesse, Now we must learne to pipe, and pick our livings Out of old rotten ends: these twenty five yeares I have serv'd my Countrie, lost my youth and bloud, Expos'd my life to dangers more then dayes. Yet let me tell my wants, I know their answers, The King is bound to right me, they good people Have but from hand to mouth, looke to your wives Your yong trim wives, your high-day wives your march-paines, For if the souldiers find not recompence, As yet there's none a hatching; I beleeve You men of wars, the men of wars will nick ye, For sterve nor beg they must not, my small meanes Are gone in fumo: here to raise a better Unlesse it be with lying, or dog flattering, At which our Nations excellent; observing dog-dayes, When this good Lady broyles, and would be basted By that good Lord or such like morall learnings, Is here impossible; Well, I will rub among 'em If any thing for honestie be gotten, Thou't be but bread and cheese I can be satisfied, If otherwise the wind blow, stiffe as I am Yet I shall learne to shuffle: There's an old Lasse That shall be namelesse yet alive, my last hope, Has often got me my pocket full of crownes If all faile, Jack-Dawes, are you alive still?

Away thou world worme, Thou win a matchles beautie? Si. 'Tis to loos't Sir For being dead wher's the reward I reach at, The love I labour for? Mem. There it begins foole Thou art meerly cozend; for the loves wee now know Are but the heats of half an houre; and hated Desires stir'd up by nature to increase her Licking of one another to a lust; Course and base appetites earths meere inheritours And heires of Idlenes and blood; Pure Love That that the soule affects and cannot purchase VVhile she is loden with our flesh, that love Sir VVhich is the price of honour dwells not here, Your Ladies eyes are lamplesse to that vertue, That beautie smiles not on a cheeke washt over, Nor sents the sweets of Ambers; below, Siphax Below us, in the other VVord, Elizium, VVher's no more dying, no despairing, mourning, VVhere all desires are full, deserts downe loden, There Siphax, there, where loves are ever living, Si. VVhy doe we love in this VVorld then? Mem. To preserve it, The maker lost his worke els: but marke Siphax, VVhat issues that love beares. Si. VVhy Children Sir; I never heard him talke thus; thus divinesse And sensible before Mem. It does so, Siphax, Things like our selves, as sensuall vaine unvented Bubles and breath of ayres, got with an itching As blisters are; and bred, as much corruption Flowes from their lives, sorrow conceives and shapes 'em And oftentimes the deaths of those we love most The breeders bring them to the VVorld to curse 'em, Crying they weepe amongst us like young Catts, Cares and continuall crosses keeping with 'em, They make time old to tend them and experience An asse they alter so; they grow and goodlie 'Ere we can turne our thoughts, like dropps of water They fall into the maine, and knowne no more; This is the love of this world: I must tell thee For thou art understanding Si. What you please Sir Mem. And as a faithfull man Nay I dare trust thee I love the Princesse Si. There 'tis that has fired him I knew he had some inspiration But does she know it Sir? Mem. Yes marry does she I have given my heart unto her Si. If ye love her Mem. Nay understand me, my heart taken from me Out of my body man and so brought to her How lik'st thou that braue offer? ther's the love I told thee of; and after death the living; She must in justice, come boye, ha? Si. Your heart Sir? Mem. I, so by all meanes Siphax Si. He loves rost well That eates the spitt Mem. And since thou art come thus fitlie Ile doe it presentlie and thou shall carrie it For thou canst tell a storie and discribe it And I coniure thee Siphax by thy gentrie Next by the glorious battells we have fought in By all the dangers, wounds, heats, colds, distresses, Thy love next and obedience, nay thy life Si. But one thing first Sir, if she pleas'd to grant it Could ye not love her here and live, consider Mem. Ha? yes I thinke I could Si. 'Twoul'd be far neerer Besides the sweets here, would induce the last love And linckt it in Mem. Thou sayest right, but our ranckes heere And bloods are barrs between us, she must stand off too As I perceive she does Si. Desert and dutie Makes even all Sir Mem. Then the King, though I Have merited as much as man can; must not let her, So many Princes covetous of beautie; I woo'd with all my heart but 'tis impossible Si. Why say she marry after Mem. No she dare not The Gods dare not doe ill: come Si. Doe you meane it Mem. Lend me thy knife, and helpe me of Si. For heav'n sake Be not so stupid mad deare Generall. Mem. Dispatch, I say. Si. As ye love that ye looke for Heaven and the blessed life. Mem. Hell take thee Coxcombe, Why dost thou keepe me from it; thy knife, I say. Si. Doe but this one thing, on my knees I beg it, Stay but two houres till I returne againe, For I will to her, tell her all your merits, Your most unvalu'd love, and last your danger; If shee relent, then live still, and live loving, Happy, and high in favour: if she frowne; Mem. Shall I be sure to know it. Si. As I live Sir, My quick returne shall either bring ye fortune, Or leave you to your owne fate. Mem. Two houres? Si. Yes, Sir. Mem. Let it be kept, away, I will expect it. Exeunt Memnon Siphax. Enter Chilax, Foole and Page. Chi. You dainty wits two, an ye to a Cater, To cheat him of a dinner. Boy.

My blood lost and my limbes stif; my embraces Like the cold stubborne barkes heauie and hearles My words worse: my fame only and atcheivements Which are my strength, my blood, my youth, my fashion, Must woe her, win her, wed her; that's but wind And Women are not brought to bed with shadowes: I doe her wrong, much wrong; she is young and blessed, Sweet as the spring, and as his blossomes tender, And I a nipping northwind, my head hung With hailes, and frostie Isicles: are the soules so too When they depart hence, lame and old, and loveles?

Orpheus, I am come from the deep's below, To thee fond man the plagues of love to show: To the faire fields where loves eternall dwell Ther's none that came, but first they passe through hell: Harke and beware unlesse thou hast loved ever, Beloved againe, thou shalt see those joyes never. Hark how they graone that dyed despairing, O take heed thou: Hark how they houle for over daring All these were men. They that be fooles, and dye for fame They loose their name, And they that bleed Harke how they speed.

Death, I can scarce believe I live yet, It gave me on the buttocks, a cruell, a huge bang, I had a lieue a had 'em scratcht with dog-whips; Be quiet henceforth, now ye feele the end on't, I would advise ye my old friends the good gentlewoman Is strucken dumbe, and there her grace sits mumping Like an old Ape eating a Brawn; sure the good Goddesse Knew my intent was honest, to save the Princesse. And how we young men are entic'd to wickednesse By these lewd women, I had paid for't els too: I am monstrous holy now, and cruel fearefull, O! 'twas a plaguy thump, charg'd with a vengeance.

Arme, arme, arme, arm, the Scouts are all come in Keepe your rankes close and now your honours win.

O view the wings of horse, the meadows scowring, The vant-guard marches bravely, hark the Drumsâdub, dub, They meet they meet, now the Battell comes, See how the Arrows fly That darken all the skie, Harke how the Trumpets sound, Hark how the hills rebound,âTara-tara-tara. Hark how the horses charge: in boyes, in boyes, in,âtara, tara, The Battell totters; now the wounds begin, O how they cry, O how they dy. Roome for the valiant Memnon, arm'd with thunder, See how he breakes the rankes asundor: They fly, they flie, Eumenes has the Chace, And brave Posibius, makes good his place. To the plaines, to the Woods, To the Rocks to the floods, They fly for succour: Follow, follow, follow, Hey, hey. Harke how the Souldiers hollow Brave Diocles is dead, And all his Souldiers fled, Tho battell's won, and lost, That many a life hath cost. Mem. Now forward to the Temple. Exeunt. Enter Chilax. Chi.

We both appeare, where I will shew the Oracle, For till that time I am bound, I must not answer. Siph. O happy I! Chi. Ye are a made man. Siph. But Chilax Where are her women? Chi. None but your Graces Sister, Because she would have it privat to the world yet, Knowes of this businesse. Siph. I shall thanke the Chilax, Thou art a carefull man. Chi. Your Graces servant. Siph. I'le find a fit place for thee. Chi. If you will not, There's a good Lady will she points yee forward, Away and take your fortune, not a word sir, So, you are greas'd I hope. Exit.

Why the King is with him, And all the Lords. Chi. Is not the Princesse there too. Strem.

Where's young Polidor? Strem. Dead as they said o'th' sudden. Chi. Dead? Strem. For certaine, But not yet knowne abroad. Chi. There's a new trouble; A brave young man he was; but we must all die.

And here are thumpers, Chickens, golden rogues, Fit wit ye rascalls. Foole. I have a Sty here Chilax. Chi.

Strem. No the King comes, And all the traine. Chi. Away then, our Act's ended. Exeunt. Enter King, Calis. Memnon and Cleanthe, Curtisan, Lords. King. You know he do's deserve ye, loves ye dearly, You know what bloody violence had us'd The Hearse ready Polidor, Eumenes &amp; Captains Upon himselfe, but that his brother crost it, You know the same thoughts stil inhabit in him And covet to take birth: Look on him Lady, The wars have not so far consum'd him yet, Cold age disabled him, or sicknesse sunk him To be abhorr'd; looke on his Honour sister, That beares no stamp of time, no wrinkles on it, No sad demolishment, nor death can reach it: Looke with the eyes of heaven that nightlie waken, To view the wonders of my glorious Maker, And not the weaknesse: looke with your vertuous eyes, And then clad royaltie in all his conquests; His matchlesse love hung with a thousand merits Eternall youth attending, Fame and Fortune, Time and Oblivion vexing at his vertues, He shall appeare a miracle: looke on our dangers, Looke on the publique ruine. Calis. O, deare brother. King. Fie, let us not like proud and greedy waters Gaine, to give off againe: this is our Sea, And you his Cynthia, govern him, take heed, His flouds have bin as hie, and full as any, And gloriously now is got up to the girdle, The Kingdomes he hath purchas'd; noble Sister, Take not your vertue from him, O take heed We ebbe not now to nothing, take heed Calis. Calis. The wil of heaven not mine, which must not alter, And my eternall doome for ought I know Is fixt upon me; alas, I must love nothing, Nothing that loves againe must I be blest with: The gentle Vine climbs up the Oke and clips him And when the stroke comes, yet they fall together; Death, death must I enjoy, and live to love him, O noble Sir! Mem. Those teares are some reward yet, Pray let me wed your sorrowes. Calis. Take 'em Souldier, They are fruitfull ones, lay but a sight upon 'em, And strait they will conceive to infinites; I told ye what, ye could find 'em, Roome before there. Knock. Enter Funerall, Captaines following, and Eumenes. King. How now, what's this? more drops to th'Ocean? Whose body's this? Capt. The noble Polidor, This speakes his death. Mem. My Brother dead? Calis. O Goddesse! O cruell, cruell Venus, here's my fortune. King. Read Captaine. Mem. Read aloude: farewell my follies. Eumen reades To the Excellent Princesse Calis. 1. Cap. Be wise, as you are beauteous, love with judgement, And look with clear eyes on my noble Brother, Value desert and vertue, they are Jewells, Fit for your worth and wearing: take heed Lady, The Gods reward ingratitude most grievous; Remember me no more, or if you must, Seeke me in noble Memnons love, I dwell there: I durst not live, because I durst not wrong him, I can no more, make mee eternall happy With looking downe upon your loves. Farewell. Mem. And did'st thou die for me? King. Excellent vertue! What will ye now doe? Calis. Dwell for euer here sir. Mem. For me deare Polidor? Ã´ worthy young man! O love, love, love, love above recompence! Infinite love, infinite honesty! Good Lady leave, you must have no share here, Take home your sorrowes: here's enough to store me, Brave glorious griefes! was ever such a brother? Turne all the stories over in the world yet, And search through all the memories of mankind, And find me such a friend; h'as out-done all, Outstript 'em sheerely, all, all, thou hast Polidor, To die for me; why, as I hope for happinesse, 'Twas one of the rarest thought on things The bravest, and carried beyond compasse of our actions, I wonder how he hit it, a young man too, In all the blossomes of his youth and beautie, In all the fulnesse of his veines and wishes Woed by that Paradice, that would catch heaven; It starts me extreamly, thou blest Ashes, Thou faithfull monument, where loue and friendship Shall while the world is, worke new miracles. Calis. O! let me speake too. Mem. No not yet, thou man, For we are but mans shadowes, only man, I have not words to utter him; speake Lady, I'le thinke a while. Calis. The Goddesse grants me this yet, I shall enjoy the dead: no tombe shall hold thee But these two armes, no Trickments but my teares Over thy Hearse, my sorrowes like sad armes Shall hang for ever: on the tuffest Marble Mine eyes shall weepe thee out an Epitaph, Love at thy feet shall kneele, his smart bow broken; Faith at thy head, youth and the Graces mourners; O sweet young man! King. Now I begin to melt too. Mem. Have ye enough yet Lady? roome for a gamster To my fond Love, and all those idle fancies A long farwell, thou diedst for me deare Polidor, To give me peace, thou hast eternall glory, I stay and talke here; I will kisse thee first, And now I'le follow thee. Polidor rises. Pollidor. Hold, for heavens sake! Mem. Ha! Does he live? Dost thou deceive me? Pol. Thus farre, Yet for your good, and honour. King. Now deare sister; Calis. The Oracle is ended, noble sir, Dispose me now as you please. Po. You are mine then? Calis. With all the joyes that may be. Po. Your consent sir; King. Ye have it freely. Po. Walke along with me then, And as you love me, love my will. Calis. I will so. Po. Here worthy Brother, take this vertuous Princesse, Ye have deserv'd her nobly, she will love ye, And when my life shall bring ye peace, as she does, Command it, ye shall have it. Mem. Sir, I thanke ye. King. I never found such goodnesse in such yeares. Mem. Thou shalt not over-doe me, though I die for't, O how I love thy goodnesse, my best brother, You have given me here a treasure to enrich me, Would make the worthiest King alive a begger, What may I give you back againe? Po. Your love sir. Mem. And you shall have it, even my dearest love, My first, my noblest love, take her againe, sir, She is yours, your honesty has over-run me, She loves ye, lov'st her not? excellent Princesse, Injoy thy wish, and now get Generalls. Po. As ye love heaven, love him, she is only yours, sir. Mem. As ye love heaven, love him, she is only yours, sir; My Lord, the King. Po. He will undoe himselfe sir, And must without her perish; who shall fight then? Who shall protect your Kingdome? Mem. Give me hearing, And after that beliefe, were she my soule (As I doe love her equall) all my victories, And all the living names I have gain'd by warre, And living him that good, that vertuous good man, That only worthy of the name of brother, I would resigne all freely, 'tis all love To me, all marriage rites, the joy of issues To know him fruitfull, that has been so faithfull. King. This is the noblest differenceâtake your choise sister. Calis. I see they are so brave, and noble both, I know not which to looke on. Pol. Chuse discreetly, And vertue guide ye, there all the world in one man Stands at the marke. Mem. There all mans honestie, The sweetnesse of all youthâ Cal. O God's! Mem. My Armour, By all the God's she's yours; my armes, I say, And I beseech your Grace, give me imployment, That shall be now my Mistresse: here my Courtship. King. Ye shall have any thing. Mem. Vertuous Lady, Remember me, your servant now; Young man, You cannot over-reach me in your goodnesse; O love! how sweet thou look'st now? and how gentle, I should have slubber'd thee, and stain'd thy beauty; Your hand, your hand sir; King. Take her, and Heaven blesse her. Mem. So. Po. 'Tis your will sir, nothing of my merit; And as your royall gift, I take this blessing. Cal. And I from heaven this gentleman: thanks Goddess. Mem. So ye are pleas'd now Lady; Cal. Now or never. Mem. My cold stiffe carkasse, would have frozen ye, Warres, warres. King. Ye shall have warres. Mem. My next brave battell I dedicate to your bright honour (sister,) Give me a favour, that the world may know I am your souldier. Calis. This, and all faire Fortunes. Mem. And he that beares this from me, must strike boldly. Cleanthe kneeling. Cal. I do forgive thee: be honest, no more wench. King. Come now to Revells, this blest day shall prove The happy crown of noble Faith and Love. Exeunt.</field>

Here lyes the doubt now, let our Playes be good, Our owne care sayling equall in this Flood; Our preparations new, new our Attire, Yet here we are becalm'd still, still i'th' mire, Here we stick fast; Is there no way to cleare This passage of your judgement, and our feare, No mittigation of that law? Brave friends, Consider we are yours, made for your ends, And every thing preserves it selfe, each will If not perverse, and crooked, utters still The best of that it ventures in: have care Ev'n for your pleasures sake, of what we are, And doe not ruine all: You may frowne still. But 'tis the nobler way, to check the will. FINIS.</field>
