      <field name="fulltext">ANTIOCHUS: A TRAGEDY,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">? PeriturÃ¦ parcite ChartÃ¦. Juv.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE Right Honourable WASHINGTON Earl of Ferrers, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, By a Friend. From the black Scene of a late guilty Year, Ill may it seem to be invited here, To see imaginary Woes display'd, When half the Nation is a Victim made, And to a real Tragedy betray'd. The Time has been, when to our Stage's Fame, The gen'rous Briton for Improvement came, T'employ his virtuous Griefs, when Worth complains, And recompence with Tears the Poet's Pains: Whilst tott'ring States, and violated Laws Warm'd his resenting Heart in Freedom's Cause, How was he taught, while other Empires groan, To bless the firmer Basis of his own? Pass we the next Reflection byânor dare To tell ourselves, we're alter'd as we are; Our once extensive Tide of Pity's lost, Our Sorrows only to ourselves engross'd; That on the Stage no Tragick Horrors rise, But call our own Afflictions in our Eyes: No Trust-Betrayers sign their Country's Doom, But strait our Wrongs cry out, Those Villains are at home. Grant the sad Truth, sure Britain ne'er can bear To learn th'unhappy Lesson of Despair; Spite of the Tools of one detected Cheat, Can fix a joyful Trust in Patriots yet, Who will repair the Breach our Fortunes stood, And search with Roman Hearts for English Good. Secure of this, let languish'd Arts no more Curse this unkind uncultivated Shore; Learn from our Scenes just Morals once again, Nor let the starving Muses toil in vain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. The Curtain falling, Mrs. Seymour comes forward with Mr. Quin and Mr. Egleton. Mrs. Seymour. What now! pray hold, there's something more to say, There ought to be an Epilogue to th'Play. Are you to speak it, Sir, or Mr. Quin? The Company expects you should begin: They look as if they long'd to be dismiss'd; At least I do, I'm sure, to be undress'd. Beginâ Mr. Quin. Begin! who is it you command, I pray? Methinks you give yourself strange Airs to-day. Mrs. Seymour. Ha! Airs! dear Surly, Airs didst thou reply? Thou art a well-bred Creature, let me die: Have you a mind to sink the Play? why do it, I care not that [snapping her Fingers] d'you see, I'm not the Poet. Mr. Quin. No, thank our Stars, tho' we have many a Bard, There's not one Female Scribbler in the Herd. Mrs. Seymour. My Sex traduc'd, had I a Sword to draw, I'd prove Apollo made no Salique Law. Mr. Egleton. Come, this is nothing to the Play, I take it; The Epilogueâpray, Madam, will you speak it? Mrs. Seymour. Why, what have I with th'Epilogue to do? Mr. Egleton. The Poet told me, that he gave it you. Mrs. Seymour. Me! Lord! I've lost it then, I vow and swear. Bless me! where could I put it?âOh! 'tis here; But hang me, if one single Word I know: Dear, Mr. Thingum, will you prompt me? do. Hold, how do I begin? Oh! the old Way: Ladies, to you our Author trusts his Play: He hopes the Conduct of the Scenes just past Gives no Offence to your judicious Taste: By aged Beaux they mayn't be much approv'd, They think they're ne'er too old to be belov'd; But we know sure, what suits our Palates best, To look for Spring in Autumn is a Jest: Give me a Youth of Twenty when I wed, I hate Memento Mori in my Bed. Our Heroine, you see, preferr'd the Prince, In that you needs must own, she shew'd her Sense. The King had Honours in his Gift, and Gold, The King was Lord of allâbut he was old: But then when all was rugâthe duce was in it, She dy'd, and lost the dear, the lucky Minute; Poor foolish Girl, thus only to miscarry, Because the Man she lov'd she could notâmarry: Had she been English, she'd have learnt the Art To gratify her Prideâyet ease her Heart.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dramatis PersonÃ¦. MEN. Seleucus, King of Syria. Mr. Quin. Antiochus, his Son. Mr. Ryan. Arsaces, a Prince of a Neighbouring Court, Friend to Antiochus. Mr. Egleton. Nicanor, a Statesman, formerly the General. Mr. Boheme. Cleartes, his Creature. Mr. Diggs. WOMEN. Stratonice, the Bride of Seleucus. Mrs. Seymour. Semandra, his Daughter. Mrs. Spiller. Imene, Attendant on Stratonice. Mrs. Gulick. Guards, &amp;c. SCENE, the Court of Seleucus in Antioch.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Nicanor and Cleartes. Nican. Joy! didst thou say a Day of gen'ral Joy? No, no, Cleartes, you and I, my Friend, Are Strangers to the Triumph. True, the King Is happy to his utmost Stretch of Hope; This Day surrenders to his eager Arms The dear Expence of many a thousand Sighs, And all the Tortures of impatient Love: And (as each Star was brib'd to do him pleasure) Glory's his Vassal, and Success his Slave; War's happy Laurels with the Myrtle twin'd, In such abundance grace his ample Brow, That e'en, if possible, his very Transports A while are lost by crowding on too fast. Clear. But by whose Arm were those Atchievements wrought, That add these Laurels to his Father's Pomp? Antiochusâ Nican. Yes, yes, ye Gods, I thank ye; 'Tis he, the Rival Boy whose stripling Fame Will, in a senseless, partial, fawning Court, Throw my as-well experienc'd Merit out To worse than Envy, to accurs'd Oblivion. Thou know'st I was the Generalâbut no more, I've other Wounds; past Injuries are lost In th'Apprehension of far worse to come: Thou say'st the Prince Arsaces, as in Friendship, Brother in Arms, and Partner in the War, Comes with Antiochus, to claim, O Hell! For his vain Services no mean Reward, The richest fairest Gem our Empire holds; Semandraâthereâ Clear. Nay, now indeed I blame you: Is that a Wound that's worthy a Complaint, A Sigh, a Moment's Torture from my Friend? Would Great Nicanor like Nicanor act, Quick from his Thought the Trifle is eras'd, And the inglorious Ruin charms no more. Nican. Reproach me, do; true, thou mayst make me blush, With Shame confess, but not amend my Crime: An Age of honest Service ill repaid, My Fame o'erthrown, cashier'd from my Command; Why dost thou think I stoop'd to this Disgrace, And bent my stubborn Soul to be as mean As Fortune was ungrateful? Why, for her; Each Moment that her Beauties rose to Thought, Each Moment more and more I was a Slave, Disgrace was no Disgrace, her Father's Frowns Esteem'd as Honours, so I liv'd but near her: But what is all this wretched Pleasure now? What has my double Servitude done for me? I fawn'd, I won on the believing King To keep me Partner in his Councils still; Still I beheld the Royal Charmer's Eyes, Still I work'd on against opposing Fate, But still Destruction came: Behold th'Event! Clear. Then like yourself resolve upon the Cure. Nican. What Cure but Vengeance? Clear. Level'd against whom? Nican. All, all that are my Foes. Clear. Excepting her That holds your Heart, has she receiv'd your Vows? Nican. Love, ever anxious, ever under awe, Struggling to plead, yet fearful to offend, Bad me conceal, what by Concealment burns With heighten'd Fury. Fair Semandra knows not, But thro the dumb Devotion of my Eyes, The Heart that throbs with Love, and pants for her. Clear. If hitherto unsafe, it will be far More dang'rous to divulge the Secret now. Nican. Thou know'st, Cleartes, with what open Faith I lean upon thy Friendship; e'er an Hour, Thou shalt partake each Counsel of my Soul, And such, I may depend on't, thou'lt believe Worthy myself to form, and thee to share. But see our Monarch's new-espous'd Stratonice Bends this way, but methinks with such a Mein, So pensive, with such Looks of ill-tim'd Grief, That one would swear, whilst Nature rather ought In artless, Traytor Blushes to betray How the Soul glow'd for unexperienc'd Joys, Love's promis'd Scene, a Husband's first Embrace, She mourn'd a Husband's LossâBut she is here: My present Plan of Mischief calls us hence. [Exit Nic. and Clear. Enter Stratonice and Imene. Strat. How ill this flatt'ring Pageantry becomes A Heart so long familiar with Despair! Oh glorious Badges of severest Woe! In Ruin rich, industriously cruel, To feed my Frenzy with your glitt'ring Horrors, And tell me I am wedded to a Crown: Fatal Ascent! for ever lost Stratonice! Ime. Madam, restrain this Mutiny of Grief, On such a Day, when Great Seleucus bids One loud continu'd IÃ¶-PÅan rise, Waft to the Sky th'Abundance of his Bliss, And sums the Centre of that Bliss in you; Oh do not with this envious Burst of Tears Delude the gen'ral Joy, delude a King That loves to such Excess. Strat. Peace! wherefore would'st thou tell The Bankrupt Wretch his Miseries are more Than yet he apprehends?âBut I, alas! Am sure acquainted with the Height of mine: Thou say'st the Kingânay moreâOh merciless Fate! For he demands a nearer Title now, My Husband loves me: Is there aught the Powers In fuller Rigour could have doom'd their Slave, Than what I suffer now? This guilty Hand Has wrong'd the expecting King, undone myself: I gave this Hand in Promise of such Joys As he shall never, never reap from me; The Compact's void, my Heart declares it void. Ime. If this Aversion was at first conceiv'd, Why did you not long, long e'er this oppose What now you mourn too late? Strat. I know not why, But that it was decreed I should be wretched: I was in league with Fate against myself, I knew my Father sent me to this Court To knit the Bands of their Alliance more By such a Marriage; yet I knew withall, Tho Duty urg'd the hard Injunction much, And Disobedience aw'd me with a Curse, Disinterested Love rejected all, Look'd down on Empire with a pitying Scorn, And shew'd me Crowns and Diadems were there, Where Passions blended, and Souls met each other. Then why, Imene, why am I indeed This very Wretch I dreaded to be made, This Royal Victim, voluntary Slave To painful Greatness and detested Nuptials? Oh I could tell thee, but the Gods forbid A Thought so inconsistent with itself, A Thought so fraught with Dread, and big with Guilt, Should be unfolded now. Ime. It cannot be; The chaste Stratonice can ne'er have Thoughts, But may be trusted to Imene's Ear. Strat. What trust it to another! 'tis too much That to myself 'tis known. Oh Virtue! why Do I allow it known, when doing so I authorize the Crime, and blindly give More loose to the invading Ruin still? Ime. Now on my Knees I do request you tell me. Strat. Did'st thou not call me Chaste? And Heav'n desert me When most I need its Aid, if e'er my Soul Repines at Years of Tortures, be their Edge Sharp as the furious Pangs that rend me now, To keep inviolate that sacred Name. Rage on, ye burning Devastations, rage; 'Tis just you point your venom'd Stings on her, That gave your foster'd Mischiefs Harbour first. Ime. Madam, you rave. Strat. And it is fit I should: Can Hurricanes descend, and Seas be calm? Can pinching Hunger feed on Golden Dreams? Can fierce Convulsions shake the fev'rish Frame, And Reason keep its Empire o'er the Mind? Can Misery cease to mourn, and Bondage smile? Can LoveâBut what have I to do with Love? Oh Horror! and yet Ãtna's Fires are cold, Its Terrors trifling to the Sulphur here: Oh Gods the Pain! Oh full Extent of Madness! Wild Contradiction! languish for a Curse, And pine for what I wish not to enjoy. Ime. Alas you think not on the dire Event; Think not, whilst thus you waste your gloomy Hours, How much the King upbraids your tardy Love, And wonders at your Absence; nay, when more Than double Triumphs pierce the echoing Dome, To hail the Fortune his returning Son Brings on his Victor Sword: for now, ev'n now, The News is brought of his Approach. Strat. Then all is o'er: Fate has at last been kind, I and my Woes Are ended now at once. [Faints. Ime. Good Heaven, in pity Disperse these Sorrows that o'erpow'r her Senses: Yet there is Hope, returning Spirits swell Her heaving Breast, and speak recover'd Life. How fare you? Strat. Thou hast seen a supple Plant, The poor insulted Mark of many a Storm, That bends to ev'ry Blast, as thinking each To be its last, yet still revives to more; Thou see'st thy Mistress now, just so is she, A sickly Being, form'd the Sport of Fate, To shake with ev'ry Buffet of its Rage, Unfit to live, and yet forbid to die. Ime. Madam, disguise your Griefs; the King is here. Enter the King. King. Who have their Griefs? whose Tears are treasur'd up To flow within our Court, upon a Day Sacred to Joy, Stratonice, and Love? While Dungeons revel, and partake my Triumphs, Who talks of dying? What our Queen! away, Vanish these Thoughts, live, and enjoy an Empire That stretches wide as the victorious Arms Of my Antiochus extend their Terrors: Live, and enjoy those Laurels that a Son, So rich in gallant Deeds, and strong in Fame, Plucks from the Pride of Victory for you. Strat. Oh Misery! Misery! what can I reply! Blindly his Ignorance inflames the Wound His Fondness strives to cure: Great Gods, my Agonies! He thinks to charm me with the Godlike Worth Of his Illustrious Son, unknowing yet, To all our Ruins, I am charm'd too much. [Aside. King. Nay, I must charge thee with Unkindness now; Are these the Transports of a Bridal Day? This the vast Harvest of luxuriant Raptures, Love flatter'd me to hope without Alloy? Was there a Wish, since first thy Beauties drew me, Since first my willing Soul put on your Chains, My Fancy ever form'd, but thou wast there A Part, or rather all? Ungenerous Mourner! Like Men that follow Glory in a Dream, And lose their Idol whilst they stretch to grasp it, Am I at last, by having all I wish'd So near within my power, the more deceiv'd, And further from the sweet Possession still? Strat. I own, my Lord, with Justice you condemn A Wretch that stands already self-condemn'd: Whence, think you, flow these Tears? they flow for you: What are these Griefs but your Avengers all? King. Confusion! fall these Tears on my account? What hast thou done to urge Revenge from me? Mysterious Frenzy! from a Heart that beats With eager Longings, and o'erflows with Fondness? But wherefore do I listen to Destruction? Why do I give these mimick Terrors way? There's not a Sound malevolent to Love My Coward Fears shall henceforth dare admit: Nay, should it come from thee, Suspicion hence, And haunt the black caballing Traytor's Breast, Or be the Murth'rer's Curse, my Bride and I Be Strangers to thy Poison. Come, my Stratonice, Enough thy Virgin Doubts have paid the Debt That Modesty demands, Love summons now. Strat. Must I dissemble? Oh ye Gods forgive The Fraud your matchless Tyrannies require. [Aside. Excuse these Struggles of my Maiden Pride; You say that Duty claims me, take me hence, Bear me away, and hide me from myself, For I confess I love, to Madness love. King. Oh great Amends for Ages of Despair! Musick to lift the Soul beyond a Power Of bearing the Delight! Thus, thus, my Queen, I take the Earnest of my future Joys; Look down, ye Gods, and envy happier Man Your own fair Gifts, whilst thus Seleucus thanks ye. Strat. To what am I arriv'd? Most monstrous Practice! Blind in his Hopes, he credits what he wishes, Nor sees the lurking-Ill; whilst pleasing Guile Flatters the Father I adore the Son. AntiochusâHell! lash my tortur'd Senses With any Thought but that, and I'll be happy yet. [Aside. King. Oh charming Proof of Innocence and Love! I find thy anxious Bosom labours yet With the becoming Strife. Enter Cleartes. Welcome, Cleartes, Thy Looks seem flush'd with some important News, And such as may command our Welcome too: I guess thy Message; of our Son? Clear. Of Him, Who comes in Person to confirm the Fortune Fame gave imperfect to our Hopes before; A short Hour's March will give him to your Arms. King. This is indeed to feel the Smiles of Fortune, When all her lavish Good pours in so fast, As if industrious to prevent the Crime Of wishing half her unexpected Bounty. Heav'ns such a Day! that ev'n my Minutes teem With Joys too mighty for another's Year; Where-e'er I turn my Eyes, they feast on Raptures, Stratonice attracts their gladden'd Rays; Where-e'er my Thoughts soar boundless, Raptures still Form the luxurious Scene, and draw them in. Strat. Why feel not I such guiltless Raptures too? No, no, my Heart's my Enemy, myself My own severest Curse; I am all one Cloud Of Darkness and Despair. [Aside. King. Cleartes, go, Let Triumph swell its Note yet louder still; We tax our whole Dominions to discharge Our Gratitude to Heav'n: search every Look, Who dare to shew a gloomy Face rebel, Whose Brows contemptuous frown, they frown their last, Since I'm their Monarch, and my Debt is theirs. But whilst we loiter, we ourselves are guilty, And lose th'Enjoyment of those Gifts we praise: Come, my Stratonice, the publick Joys Will not allow a Moment's Absence more, This Day the Pride and Luxury of Empire Is all prepar'd to charm thee from thy Fears, Sooth thee to Bliss, and fashion thee to Love. Strat. Such vain precarious Pomp let others prove, Bliss of a different kind my Miseries crave, For Purple Robes a Shrowd, and for my Throne a Grave. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. King and Nicanor. King. Unsay thy false Report, thou wrong'st my Son. To all a Father's Fondness this Return? What shun us, beg permission to absent, Retire unseen, nor taint the gen'ral Joy? What! when he knew the very Source of Joy Is dead by this Reply? that ev'n our Bride With all the tempting Warmth of Youth and Love, With all the Richness of untasted Charms, Scarce keeps Desire alive? Nican. He feign'd indeed Indisposition as from long Fatigues, Heav'n grant the Cause no worse. King. Nicanor, peace! Nican. Your Majesty commands, and I have done: Yetâ King. Ay, by that thou would'st suggest 'tis hard, This Sickness could not chuse another Day, Times less suspicious: but thou say'st he pleads A real Sickness; why, it may be so, It must: I would not, to preserve my Crown, Mistrust another Cause. I know him Loyal, And wrong myself to doubt the Mind I form'd The Copy of my own; I gave the Steps That led to Glory, he pursu'd the Track, And with as sure Success repaid my Care: To crown the whole, survey his present Conquest; Thrice has the stoutest Captain of our Age Attack'd our Frontiers, thrice been beaten back, And taught to curse a beardless Victor's Sword. Nican. [aside ...] And I have equal cause to curse it too; But I must stifle my resenting Choler, And praise the Virtue I have sworn to ruin. [... aside] Perish that canker'd Tongue that dares deny The Merit of those Deeds th'attesting World With Dread commends, as it foresaw in him A second Alexander's Soul transfus'd, Its second Conquest, and its future Lord; You gave his Breast these Ardours of Ambition, Ambition is a Soldier's Thirst for Power, What then? too nobly has your gen'rous Son Approv'd his Duty, to alarm Suspicion; Or Signs of Disaffection strong as his, In any other Prince, that stood like him The Heir to tempting Sway and promis'd Crowns, Less lov'd, or less deserving Father's Love, Might intimate beware. King. Furies and Madness! Where tend these racking, double-meaning Sounds? Equivocating Torturer! I swear Thou art a Traytor; Envy and Revenge Thus prompt thy Rancour. Nican. Does Nicanor live Thus to be branded? No, was I a Traytor, I had not given you grounds to call me so; I might have check'd this ill-requited Zeal, Stifled these Fears of Loyalty, and let The threatning Danger, undetected, sleep: Yet, fearless of your Rage, I'll dare to serve you: A Father's Fondness sees not through the Eye Of searching Policy the Son's Disease; If he is sick, he's sick of Discontent, Perhaps his tow'ring Genius brooks but ill Your second Marriage, as his jealous Pride, From a new Line of rival Kindred, dreads A future Bar to his ambitious Hopes: He had the sole Inheritance in view, So fair a Prospect may seem lessen'd now, And they may claim a Dividend of Empire. King. Curse on thy subtle Mischief-searching Brain! What sets thee on to play this Sorcery here? Take this thy ill-feign'd Honesty's Reward, When next thy saucy treasonable Zeal Shall dare approach us with its poisonous Taint, Thy forfeit Head shall feel its first Effects. [Exit King. Nican. Quick-sighted as you are, you shall not thus Escape my Snare; these Menaces but whet Ingenious Malice to a sure Dispatch, As Insults o'er a Coward give him Soul To act the Vengeance they would seem to scorn. Enter Cleartes. Cleartes! so, whence came you? Clear. From a Sight, That makes e'en Hatred mourn the Woes it wish'd; They who have Wrongs, are fully now reveng'd, Without their Guilt: your Pardon, if my Eyes Betray a Weakness, whilst my Tongue relates The Horrors they have witness'd, when instead Of a triumphant Conqueror, they saw Conquest in Tears, and Triumph in Despair, The eager Love of an adoring Court Paid to a gallant, young, victorious Prince, In pensive Looks, and Hearts that strove to shew The greatest Duty by the deepest Grief; But then the Prince himselfâ Nican. I guess thy Tale. Clear. A Change so sudden, a Disease so fierce, That works with such a dangerous Dispatch, Yet baffles all the nicest Search of Art, And keeps its Source unknown! but see, the Friendship Of young Arsaces pleads with most Success; For him alone, Antiochus allows His Pangs an Ease he grudges while he grants, As Death were all his Choice, and each lost Moment He gives to Comfort's Voice, with sad Regret He steals from Griefs he wish'd to cherish on, And puts his courted Fate the longer off. Observe them, here they come. Enter Antiochus and Arsaces. Ant. My gallant Friend, What will this cruel Kindness never cease? Still will thy lavish Heart upbraid a Wretch, With Shame-reflecting Views of what he owes, By giving on to swell the vast Account? I do thy Virtues wrong, to keep thee leagu'd To one whose Soul is from this Moment dead To every future Call of Fame, or Thee. Let War's rough Musick animate the Brave, With Notes of Glory charm the Martial Ear, Antiochus is deaf; let Tyrant's Arms Enslave the plunder'd Globe; it groans in vain: My Sword is drawn no more to set it free. Arsa. Now, by a Soldier's Pride, I will not hear This unbecoming Lethargy of Thought: Let Coward Agues, and Dismay attend The Standards of the Beaten; let Lysimachus, Pressing his pensive Couch in shiv'ring Fits, Survey the Scandal of his late Defeat; Shall you make up his Loss? against himself The Victor lend an Arm? Alas! my Friend, This Malady infects not you alone, 'Tis not a single Life you throw away; The Rivers stagnate when their Fountains die, Your mould'ring Troops admit the same Disease, And sicken with their Leader. Ant. Oh Arsaces! Give me another Heart, I'll hear thee on, Make me but what I was, when yester Sun Play'd on my burnish'd Helm, and by the Gods, Warm'd for a second Field of bloody Laurels, Glory again usurps my swelling Thoughts; Again the proud Lysimachus shall shake, And curse the gen'rous Tye that leagues against him Confederate Souls like ours: This might have been, Had Heaven revers'd the Order of the Year, And from its Round expung'd this fatal Day, This Day, that led my erring Zeal to Court, First taught me what was Woe, by heaping on me All its severe Variety at once. Nican. [aside ...] Cleartes, 'tis as my Suspicions thought, His Looks, his Words all shew he is Pride-sick; The Father's Marriage is the Son's Disease. [... aside] My Lord the Queen approaches. Ant. Lightning blast me! Wanted there this, ye Powers, to damn me more? Arsaces, come, I must, I will avoid her. Enter Stratonice. Strat. The Prince! Destruction surely guides my Steps. I am betray'd, Oh charming! dangerous Guilt! Abandon'd Woman! whither stray thy Thoughts? See, see, the Prince avoids thee, loaths thy Sight, Return the Insult, and repay his Hate; Secure thy Fame, and fly thy Virtue's Bane. Ant. Enchantment roots me here! by all the Hell Her Eyes strike through and through my burning Soul, I have no power to move, my Coward Limbs Desert me with my Heart; as when in Dreams, Tho Dangers in their utmost Horrors glare, And shew the tortur'd Sleeper no Release, But Flight; nor Flight avails, in vain he plyes His Feet to wing him off, his Feet stand still, Or measure back their Steps, till in the Jaws Of Fate the Wretch is lost. Distraction! Devils! Strat. You seem disorder'd, Sir: I fear, alas! My Presence gives you Pain. Ant. It does, it does: Yet stay, your Absence now would give me more. Methinks I feign would tell youâbut no matter, Why should I feast you with a Tale of Woe, Furnish with new Delights your greedy Hatred, And make the Knowledge of my Pains assist The barb'rous Pleasures of this Nuptial Day? Strat. Ay, there's the secret Source of your Disease; You cannot brook the Happiness I boast, When I declare myself your Father's Bride. Ant. Do you then think the Happiness so great? Strat. It seems you doubt it, judge the Task too hard For the warm Wishes of a youthful Queen To be resign'd to Duty, meet content The cold Caresses of a hoary Lord: But know you do me wrong; Seleucus, spite Of all the Disadvantages of Age, Wears every Charm to bless my utmost Wish, And would have nothing wanting to preserve An everlasting Harmony of Joys, Wanted he yet a Son. Ant. And am I then So very hateful to you? Strat. 'Tis my Pride To tell you that you are, as 'tis my Care To force you to believe it. Ant. Triumph, do, Barb'rous Insulter! Oh that half the Pride That nurses this Aversion in your Soul, Would lend Revenge to me! and teach my Heart To meet regardless this avow'd Contempt! To do its Wrongs full Justice on your Scorn, And brave your Hatred! Strat. No, you need it not; Of Hatred you already have enough; Go on, it shews the Hero I approve, T'encounter my Disdain, and match my Pride: Farewell, brave Prince, enhance my Pleasure still, Believe me still thy Foe, believe the worst That can provoke your Hate; then bless Stratonice With a Return as haughty as you please. Nicanor, wait me to the King. [Exeunt Strat. and Nic. Arsa. She's goneâ Ant. Say'st thou she's gone? Oh! no, she still is here; Her last harsh Accents still breathe Fate before me, Absent she haunts me more: this Tyrant Mother In every Object, and in every Thought, Preys on my poison'd Heart; and yet methinks I do her Justice wrong: She bids me hate, Yes, my Arsaces, thou didst hear her give The cruel kind Commandâbut Oh the Power! Not multiply'd Affronts, not all the Pangs, Not the worst Tortures of the worst Disease, The Curse of hopeless Love, can in the least Give to thy ruin'd Friend. Arsa. Why name you Love? Ant. Why does the shipwreck'd Sailor blame the Skies, The high-swoln Sea, and inauspicious Wind, But that a watry Grave each moment gapes To take the Dastard in? Alas, Arsaces, Like him I'm shipwreck'd, bulge against the Rocks, And sink with all the Billows of Despair: But Oh my Storm is Love. Arsa. Amazement! Sure You curse yourself with voluntary Pains; Love and Despair afflict Plebeian Souls, Enjoyment ought to meet each Wish you form: Is there a Beauty in your Father's Court, That with a matchless Excellence provokes The Women's Envy and the Men's Desire, Seleucus' Heir can languish for in vain? Ant. Yes, yes, there is: the Furies never nurs'd A Flame so fierce as acts its Ravage here. What have I said? I have laid open all This Mystery of Darkness and Despair; Gods! let me still despair, 'tis all my Comfort! Could I be once so wretched as to hope For the Fruition of my impious Love, Damnation were a Punishment too light. Arsa. Heav'ns! can I think he intimates the Queen? Ant. Who's he that dares believe me so abandon'd, To think the Queen, my Father's Wife, has Charms For any but my Father, least of all His Son? And yet, Oh ye infernal Judges! The proud Ixion woo'd the Wife of Jove: Unfix the daring Mortal from the Wheel, I have dar'd equal Crimes, let me relieve The tortur'd Criminal, and take my Round, My sentenc'd Age of equal Vengeance too. Arsa. Tortures and Vengeance! by the God of War, I do adjure you, force not my big Soul Thus to disgrace its Friendship in a Flood Of female Softness and enervate Pity. Have you Desires that unaccomplish'd raise This Hurricane of Rage and Height of Frenzy, Name them, Arsaces lends a willing Arm To give you wish'd Enjoyment: Think, Oh think, My Bosom feels the Taint, to see in this Degenerate Plight of impotent Complainings, The Friend, the Soldier, and the Captain lost. Ant. Ay, as thou say'st, 'tis impotent indeed: So lost, so poor of Spirit, so accurs'd, Is he that was Antiochus, that was The Hope of Empire, and what most my Soul Confess'd its Pride, the brave Arsaces' Friend; That, Woman-like, he sinks his Heart in Griefs He dares not hope to end, but with himself. Arsa. My Friend, I would not for the Bribe of Empires There liv'd another Witnessâ Ant. Fruitless Caution! Be it my Crime's full Punishment to glare In open Day, and give the babbling World Materials for their darling Theme of Scandal: Let them assault me with the rankest Gall Of just Abhorrence, and deserv'd Reproach; Let the recording Annals hand me down (Should future Ages need the dire Example) The blackest Pattern of the blackest Guilt. But wherefore do I use this Stoick Aid, Preach o'er the Wounds, which Honour bids me chafe To fiercer Smarts and aggravated Frenzy? And now, methinks, the Fates obey my Wishes, The Fever grows upon me, let it grow: For Oh each Moment of retarded Life Is added Weight of unrepented Crimes: Welcome this swift Decay of sick'ning Nature; My Limbs sink under the prodigious Load Of Horror that I carry in my Breast. Arsaces, aid me hence; I hope, my Friend, 'Tis the last Trouble I shall live to give you. Arsa. Better the Flower of all your Army mourn'd, In Streams of Blood, the Shame of a Defeat. A short Repose may give you happier Thoughts. Ant. It must be only the Repose of Death, That can disperse this Gloom of baneful Thinking, By mixing me with those who think no more. Oh Conscience, Conscience, what can be thy Balm! What can atone thy Anguish of an Hour? What Sweets of Empire, or what Waste of Power? Our idle Grandeur blazes out in vain, The Baits that strive to charm, assist the Pain; Our darling Pleasures to our Stings are wrought, Condemn'd to lash the Sins by which they're bought: Jove, throw the Engines of thy Tortures by, The guilty Bosom does them all supply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Semandra and Arsaces. Sem. This is no Time, my Lord, for you to plead, Or me to listen to a Tale of Love; Now when my most unhappy Brother wastes In the last Agonies of doubtful Life: When all the Strength of Antioch shakes in him, The Pride of Empire, and the Theme of Fame, What can a Sister's Breast admit but Grief? The Tyrant Malady has reach'd his Brain, And plays its Ravage in the Seat of Reason; Wildness of Looks, an incoherent Chain Of Words resulting from some black Ideas, Speak more and more the Danger of his Sickness: In vain his mourning Friends request the Cause, Regardless of a Cure, he slights their Tears, And laughs at his Physician's baffled Skill. Arsa. Think not, my Fair, your Brother's threatned Fate Alarms my anxious Bosom less than yours; The noblest Tye of Friendship knits him here, As dearly held my Brother as your own: But Oh! since thus your generous Nature works In Pity's tender Task, think, lovely Maid, Your Lover claims a share; it is too much, Too much to forfeit Love and Friendship too. Heav'n in compassion to the Prince's Virtues, To your good Father's, and the People's Prayers, May yet relent, and give your Brother back To Life, to Friendship, Empire, and Himself: But where's the Remedy for slighted Love? Sem. Why will you triumph o'er a Woman's Weakness, Use ill your Conquest, and insult my Blushes? Already have I own'd how much I held Your Merit in esteem; yet know, my Lord, Till whiter Hours shall justify my Conduct, In giving the Reward your Virtue claims, You wrong me to upbraid me with a Debt Fate wo'not let me pay. Arsa. Mean while, Semandra, Whilst I am only flatter'd with the Pangs Of distant Hope, and anxious Expectation, My Rival riots in the real Joy, By lawful Force usurps thy Virgin Bed. Nicanor! curse the Statesman! could his Wiles Shew the ambitious Fiend no other Mark To work their subtle Ends, but Love must bleed, And sever'd Hearts be Victims to his Pride? Sem. Ungenerous Treatment! Can you then suspect Another claims a Share within the Heart My artless Pity had bestow'd before? Do you conclude me then so loose of Will, From my too kind Attention to your own, Each vain Man's Vows may with the same Success Gain on my easy Faith? Nay more, the Wretch Whose very Name is Poison to provoke As dire Abhorrence, as his Love Disdain. Arsa. I doubt not thee, my Excellence! the Snows, When just descending thro' the purging Air, Are rival'd in their Whiteness by thy Worth: Yet as I love, I must repeat my Fears; Still do I dread how far he may improve His Interest with thy Father, still I dread Stratonice's Resentment may extend To all whom Friendship to your Brother's Cause Makes criminal to her. Sem. 'Tis strange, the Queen, Mild as a Southern Breeze to all besides, Should treat the Prince alone with such a Storm Of Anger and Aversion: but Arsaces, Thro' every Turn and Hurricane of Fate, May claim a Harbour here; Semandra's Heart Is guarded still for You, and You alone. Arsa. Oh Extasy! low'r on ye Clouds of Danger! This Musick breaks ye all, and bids my Soul Exalted swell with nought but Love and Thee. Sem. But let me warn you yet, for all our Safeties, For our own Loves, and for my Brother's Fame: The King (tho' Father never lov'd a Son With greater Fondness) by the dang'rous Wiles Of this intriguing Statesman, is at last Wrought to believe this Illness of his Son The Guilt of Discontent; and tho' indeed The bare Suggestion of a Thought so base Turn'd the first Efforts of my Father's Rage Against the Traytor's self: within an Hour, So well the crafty Villain play'd his Part, Not only to his former Height restor'd, But to accumulated Grace; he stands In double Credit with the cheated King. Arsa. Perdition sink him! I am lost again, His Rise is my Destruction. Sem. See, he comes, With the big Air of most assur'd Success: Leave me, my Lord, to meet him with the Scorn His sawcy Pride and Arrogance deserve. [Exit Arsaces. Enter Nicanor. Nican. Still, Madam, must my bleeding Griefs complain, Those Eyes that spread their gentle Lustre round, And yield, with modest Charms, Delight to all, Are taught the cruel Task to frown on me? If the petition'd Gods will deign to hear The meanest that shall kneel with honest Vows, As you resemble them in every Power To save, or to destroy, permit me hope That noblest saving Attribute inspires Redress, and Pity to the suppliant Wretch, Who begs you to accept the Vassal Heart Your Eyes first taught to know the Rage of Love. Sem. Such tastless Flatt'ry, Sir, is lost on me: If I am like the Gods, it shall be those, Whose Power of Vengeance glows with ready Bolts, To give due Chastisement to him that owns An Arrogance like yours. Presumptuous Man! Nican. Presumptuous! Furies! But I will be calm. The blest Arsaces, Madamâ Sem. What of him? Nican. He is a valiant Prince, and well deserves The Smiles his Hopes receive from her he loves: But yetâ Sem. Yet! what? In vain thy subtle Spleen Would by traducing him exalt thy self In competition with a Prince that shames, By early Progress in unmatch'd Exploits, Admiring trembling Worlds and Rival Kings. I dare to boast it, e'en to Envy's Ear, I love the Godlike Youth, I prize a Worth, The proud Nicanor can as soon outvie, As Weeds out-shoot the Oak. [Exit Semandra. Nican. Now, but for sure and meditated Vengeance, Could my great Spirit be reduc'd to all The infamous Reliefs of Love-sick Fools; To whine away my Hours in am'rous Plaints, And sooth the Pride of a poor gaudy Idol, Form'd as an only Punishment by Heaven For Cowards and for Slaves: What, spite of me, To hold my rugged Heart! I'll tear it out, And throw it for the Food of Dogs and Vulturs, E'er Woman, more insatiate Woman preys A Moment longer on the noble Havock. Enter Cleartes. Cleartes, thou art come in wish'd-for Time, To aid thy Friend, and bear me out a Man: Assist me how to rail. Clear. Leave that to Women, And the brib'd Scandal of a servile Priest; Nicanor has a Soulâ Nican. But 'tis a rotten one, There's Woman's Poison in it: Wherefore could Creating Nature find no other Scheme To propagate Man's gen'rous Species here, But it must stand indebted to a Sex That's sure to damn as fast as it conceives? Clear. My Friend's Resentments speak the Cause Semandra. Nican. Tortures! Disgrace! Deep as in Lethe's Waves, Die the abhor'd Remembrance of her Beauties! Oh could a forc'd Enjoyment once secure me A Triumph o'er her Scorn! Clear. You love her still, And still you may enjoy your utmost Lust Of Vengeance or of Love: The King, my Friend, (So well your untrac'd Politicks succeed) Holds you the dearest in his Favour's Eye; What hinders, but your Interest may demand As boldly as Arsaces? Nican. There's yet my Hope: If not, like to the furious King of Winds, I'll summon all my Mischiefs to a head, And let 'em loose at once; the King, his Son, Arsaces and Semandra, perish all, And then my self in Royal Ruin glorious! Clear. Soften your Rage, see there th'afflicted Prince! With what a dire Malignity of Fate The Fever tears him up! the tortur'd Lines Of his Majestick Visage shew his Frenzy To all the last Extremity of Horror; Tho' to the Spectre of a Man reduc'd, Madness supplies the Strength that Nature wants, By a false Vigour aiding to destroy The few unwasted Spirits Life could boast, And speed him to his End. Nican. Now by my Soul, Were I not what I am, a Sight like this Would work me to a Weakness my Designs And nobler Plans of Glory now must scorn. Clear. He flies his Couch as 'twere from Beds of Fire, Where all the Furies with their Iron Whips Stood lashing off Repose; from Place to Place He shifts for Aid, but like the restless Damn'd He finds the last uneasy as the first, And raves with all the Pains he fled in vain. Enter Antiochus. Ant. Have then so many vulgar Sinners sunk Beneath the Thunder of avenging Gods! And am not I, dire Boasting! lifted up, Or by my Birth, or rather by my Crime, Of moment full sufficient to provoke A Fate distinguish'd from th'ignoble Road Of common Deaths, a Bolt of Thunder forg'd To strike at me alone? Why must I drag This Life a Nusance to th'infected World, And its own Hell, till this too mean Disease By slow Advances sweeps the Venom off? [Seeing Nican. and Clear. Whose Instruments are you? Who set you here The Agents of inquisitive Destruction, To pry into a Soul that would have room To revel on its Tortures unobserv'd? Nican. We are the faithful Servants of your Will, Who grieve to see our Royal Master's Heir Lost to his Sire, his People, and Himself. Ant. You are a Statesman; was it your Advice, My Father winter'd o'er with sixty Years, Took a fair Lady in her Beauty's Spring, And made affronted Hymen light his Torch, When the faint Dial of expiring Life Prolcaim'd the scanty Time it had to burn? I've found your Office, Sir, a Pimp of State. Nican. My Lord, I know not how I have deserv'd This Treatment. Ant. Why, I'll tell thee, for thy Virtues; Come, let me hug thee, by the Beard of Jove, I prize a Courtier of a piercing Wit, Who to as many diff'rent Faculties Can skrew his tutor'd Conscience, and his Soul, As a skill'd Wrestler in th'Olympic Games, His pliant Limbs to Postures of Agility. Enter the King. Ha! who comes here? by all his Wrongs, my Father! I know the venerable Face; I'll fly, I'll rush into his Arms, and summon all Th'accustom'd Fondness of his easy Heart To plead in my behalf; my Crime, my Guilt, Shall all be stifled in this kind Embrace, [The King opens his Arms to embrace him; Antiochus throws himself upon the Ground.] Or buried here; yawn thou relentless Earth, And give a Villain shelter! Still he views me. Are there no Seas will part, no Mountains rise, As everlasting Barriers to oppose A Meeting of such Horror? King. Why, my Son? What has thy Father done, or what hast thou, That we should meet on Terms so strange as these? My Arms, in vain, are open to entwine My Bosom's Darling, and my Age's Pride: Rise, my Antiochus, and be thy Crimes, Which yet are Strangers to thy Father's Ear, Bold as the first Invaders of the Sky, Forgiving Love accounts them Crimes no more. Ant. Ha! whose Prerogative do you usurp? Forgiveness! 'tis not in the Power of Heaven To grant, or Wretches like myself to hope it. Oh! by the Sternness of thy honest Looks, I know you now, the awful righteous Minos, For thy fam'd Equity on Earth, prefer'd To be the Judge of guilty Ghosts below. No, thou art Pluto, the lascivious God, That ravish'd Proserpineâmy Proserpine; But give her back again, orâHa! ha! ha! I laugh to see an old Man thus deceiv'd; What feed with Flakes of Ice the Fire of Love? But come not, let me charge thee, come not near her; For if thou dost, she'll thaw thee: Fire and Furies! Ha! is she not thy Mother! What of that! She shall forgive thee, sway the easy King To seal thy Pardon too, come follow me, I'll bring thee to her. Oh my burning Brain! [Exit Antiochus. King. Cleartes, follow, and observe him well, Lest this Disorder of his Brain should urge Some frantick Blow of Mischief on himself: What can these inconsistent Words import? He names his Mother! talks of Crimes and Pardon! Nican. Might I presume to speak without Offence, Your Majesty should hear the baneful Cause. From more than slight Suspicion I have trac'd The impious Practice of the haughtyâ King. Who? Nican. Arsaces. King. How! Perdition! but go on. Nican. Him, I engage my Honour and my Faith To prove a secret Traytor to our State, And Correspondent with the Publick Foe: Th'unhappy Prince came discontented home, Your Nuptials, as my Fears surmise, the Cause; Hence if Arsaces took the trait'rous Hint, T'improve the Heats of the resenting Prince, How can it then seem strange, that strong Remorse, Or even Madness, should pursue a Thought, That breeds such Conflicts in a generous Breast? A Thought so loaded with the first great Crime Of black Ingratitude, as sure it is, To wrong th'Indulgence of so good a Father. King. By all the Tortures that thy Words impart, I find but too much Reason for Belief; But can it be? Too rashly and too soon I'll not condemn himâHell! but he is guilty: For our own Safety, and our Realm's Repose, Confine Arsaces strait, till Time is ripe To make thy Proofs appear; mean while our Son, If yet 'tis in the learn'd Physician's Art, T'explore his Wound, and give him back to Sense, Let him demand, and Empire's the Reward, For his restoring Hand; and then, ye Gods, Or clear the Worth of my suspected Darling, Or in Seleucus' instant Death be all His guilty Actions unexamin'd lost. Grief will no more: Nicanor, to thy Care We trust our Signet, and with that our Power, To act as best our Grievances require. [Exit King. Enter Cleartes. Nic. Cleartes, hadst thou come a Moment sooner, Thou hadst applauded with attesting Joy The Master-piece of Policy; at last The King has swallow'd with a greedy Jaw The Bait of his Destruction: Mark but this, Entrusted to me, with his Empire's Fate. Arsaces is the first that feels my Power, My dreaded Rival, and the Prince's Friend; Him I remove, this Signet is his Passport To quick Confinement: Say, what hinders now, But every Wish of Vengeance, or of Love, I may indulge with Riot? Clear. Need we doubt, But you have Colour strong as Truth itself, To authorize this Usage of Arsaces, And have him prov'd the Traytor that you wish him? Nican. I need it not, Fortune herself works for me, And thou shalt see thy Friend soon lifted up Above the Reach of dull enquiring Power: The Prince himself is hastning to his End: Arsaces, whom I dreaded most, debarr'd All Possibility to check my Schemes: The King I've Means to manage as I will, These two Supports, his Son and Friend, lopt off. Suppose them fruitless all, I've Letters now, That court me, from Lysimachus, to mount The Throne, his Arms will aid me to usurp: Allowing that the Time too scanty proves To ripen my Designs, these very Letters Shall make my Vengeance on Arsaces sure; Their Date and Cover vary'd to my Purpose, I'll fix the treasonable Scrowl on him: Here, here, my Friend, 's unfathomable Mischief, Great Scope for both Ambition and Revenge. Let Guilt's Reflections dastard Souls involve; Give me Success, and I'll myself absolve.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Stratonice and Imene. Strat. No more, Imene, of thy false Accounts Of Virtue, rescu'd by relenting Gods, Propp'd by some Hand of Providence unseen, And taught from deepest Anguish to extract The greatest Glory, and the fullest Joy: Deserted Virtue's Heaven's Regard no more, And Pity quits at last its fair Abode; Or where was else each unassisting Power, Each faithless Star I call'd upon in vain, When this poor Breast was doom'd to an Assault, Hell rais'd to bear down all my Guard at once, Back'd by the mightiest Powers of tempting Guilt, And half assisted by my Rebel Self? Oh Woes unmatch'd! Oh execrable Doom! Why did I live to such an Hour of Horror? Or wherefore do my Fears outlive it now? Ime. Perhaps it was the Frenzy of the Prince, That wrought his erring Tongue to Sounds of Love, His calmer Sense had shunn'd as much as yours. Strat. No, no, that Frenzy is the Guilt of Love, The fatal Sallies of an impious Flame: Have I not parted from an Interview, As dire to Sight, and terrible to Thought, As when the Ghosts of Wretches just expir'd, At their Arrival in the Court of Darkness, With all their Sins about them first, survey The dooming Looks of Hell's enquiring Judge? I saw the Prince; but Oh! in such Condition, To call it Madness is a Name too poor: I strove to fly him, but I strove in vain; He seiz'd me, swore that he had much to say Of Moment to us both: He gaz'd upon me With such a Fierceness of unjust Desire, His Eye-Balls blaz'd mixt Gleams of Love and Rage, That shew'd his Self-Resentments for the Sin Of wishing what he was condemn'd to wish, Yet knew debarr'd for ever and for ever. Ime. Heavens! how could you support it? Strat. Then he talk'd With so much Wildness; and yet even in that Betray'd too fatally the guilty Secret, That left a thousand thousand Daggers here: Despair and Pardon were the dreadful Notes, That trembled on his Tongue: with shiv'ring Looks, And all the Gestures of tormenting Horror I begg'd him to dismiss the shocking Scene; Then, as from Dictates of returning Sense, Strait he reply'd, I will, I will obey: What love my Mother! As the fatal Words Struggled their barr'd reluctant Passage forth; Such dire unheard-of monstrous Exclamations Pursu'd th'infectious Sounds, and rack'd his Soul To that severe degree, to give them vent, He seem'd to send it with them. Down he fell, Oh Gods! all pale and speechless at my Feet: With all the Strength of that poor Life was left me, I took the gloomy Minute to retire. Ime. You left him without Aid, perhaps e'en now, Oh! dreadful Consequence of lawless Love, Worn out with Pain and Shame, he breaths his last. Strat. Then he is happy, then he raves no more With impious Burnings, and incestuous Flames; No more he dreads an injur'd Father's Sight, Or drinks Destruction from a Mother's Eye: But what am I? to what am I reserv'd? To lengthen'd Misery, and continu'd Anguish? This Hour has dash'd the meanest Glimpse of Hope My Wretchedness had left; 'twas some Relief, 'Midst all this War of Guilt within my Heart, To think I suffer'd in myself alone, To think, (Oh! why so strangely have I err'd?) His Hate might be my Cure, it shall, it must; I will unknow the dire discover'd Truth, And still be happy in a false Belief. Ime. Yet are you safe, and still may hope a Cure, The Prince's Passion is a Secret yet To all the Court beside; nor could his Frenzy Impute the Pangs with which you heard his Love To aught but just Resentment and Surprize. Strat. Confusion! Yes, I heard it with Surprize; But he, as mad and frantick as he was, Might find with ease, to my eternal Shame, It was not the Surprize of virtuous Horror, The honest Tumult of a guiltless Mind: I shook, I trembled, but 'twas his Disease, Each Look betray'd that I was mad as he; And whilst he sigh'd the Story of his Woes, My Tears inform'd him they were like my own. Fair Preparation for my Bridal Night! Now I shall carry to my Husband's Arms A spotless Wife indeed, a modest Heart, That in the Circle of a loath'd Embrace, Pollutes the Raptures that it feigns to share. Ime. Why will you urge yourself to these Extremes? Strat. Why will Fate drive me? Oh! Imene, where Shall I explore a Shelter for my Name, From the upbraiding King, and censuring World? What Wastes lie uninhabited, to give My Infamy Retreat, and hide my Guilt? It wo' not be, nay tho' new Worlds arise, To bid me live a quiet Exile there, Myself the sole Inhabitant to reign, Whilst I myself am there, I fly in vain. [Exeunt. Enter Nicanor. Nican. At length the sage Physician's happier Eye Has aided the mistaken Statesman's Search, And probe'd the fatal Truth of this Disease; Momentous black Discovery! in love! 'Tis plain he is; my recollecting Thoughts Call up a thousand Symptoms to my View, That strengthen the Assertion of his Guilt; Which, thro' the Foulness of its Name alone, Escap'd the Danger of my tracing Skill: But now I have it, and I'll work it well, Nor leave it in the power of Chance or Fate To wrest the mighty Mischief from my hand; Erasistratus is engag'd to keep His Art's Success a Secret, till myself Have first extracted the Materials fit To make my Vengeance perfect at a Blow. Ha! here's Arsaces! his unwelcome Presence Seems to upbraid my dilatory Orders For his Confinement. Enter Arsaces. Ars. Ha! Nicanor here! There's something in my Nature startles at him, With fell Antipathy and mortal Hate. Nican. It may be needless to inquire the Cause, Why on Arsaces' Brow some mighty Grief Low'rs with malignant Gloom, at such a time, When the brave Friend, and Partner of his Fame, Sinks to his Grave with Maladies unknown, And leaves the Promise of a glorious Life, So well begun, i'th'Midway-Course expir'd. Ars. I have my Griefs, and my Resentments too, To see triumphant Mischief in thy Dress, To see the Courtier Crocodile's Disguise, See thy false Pity, and dissembling Tears, Insult the murther'd Object of thy Hate. Nican. Since thus thy Insolence provokes the Doom, That only waited for my Nod before, I wo' not play the Crocodile to thee, But with th'exerted Privilege of Power, Shew thee the Error of thy blust'ring Tongue, To spend its Folly on a Man that's born To teach Submission to thy Rashness thus: Secure him, Guards, this Signet here declares You act in Duty to the King's Command. [Guards seize Arsaces. Ars. Confusion! Villain, thou bely'st the King; Is this the Treatment that your Realm affords To those that are ally'd to its Defence? Dishonour! Infamy! Semandra here! Shall she be witness to her Lover's Bonds? Would'st thou act nobly with the Man thou hate'st, Would'st thou atone thy Baseness, view my Breast, Sheath here thy Sword, and bury my Disgrace. Nican. Lucky! she comes, as I could wish, to give My Soul an earnest Taste of sweet Revenge. Enter Semandra. Sem. Death to my Sight, and Daggers to my Heart! Arsaces in the dreaded Vultur's Claw! Be silent, Eyes, or inward turn your Streams, Nor with your Weakness aid the Traytor's Joy. Nican. Bear, as the Pleasure of the King directs, Your Pris'ner to the Castle; 'tis not fit The Court be tainted longer with his Crimes. Sem. Insulting Instrument of ill-plac'd Power! Would my misguided Father cease to view Thro' Traytors Eyes his Fame and Empire's Fate, This Doom had been revers'd, these Bonds that hold, To the dishonour'd King's eternal Stain, This Prince the first of his Confederate Friends, With Justice had enclos'd another's Limbs; I had beheld the proud Nicanor's self, Cursing the Sentence that he now directs. Nican. Madam, this Virtue of a Lady's Love, May mitigate the Crime of Disrespect To your great Father's wise Decree; no doubt, The King, my Master, will applaud your Choice: But I must beg you will excuse the Slave, That now obeys his Orders, and divides Such spotless Passions, and deserving Flames. Ironically. Ars. Oh Hypocrite! Oh Coward! well thou know'st, In thy successful Guilt thou stand'st secure, Or these vile Sounds of thy blaspheming Tongue Had been thy last. Semandra, gen'rous Maid, Scorn not this poor deserted Arm, that lags To scourge his Treason, and avenge thy Wrongs. Spiritless Dastard, thank the winking Gods, When such a flagrant Hour demands their Eye, They keep their Bolts asleep. Come bear me hence; Enjoy thy Crimes, since Heaven permits thee leave: Life is not worth the Care of honest Minds, When Devils, like Nicanor, have the Power To manage at their Will the shackled Curse. Semandra! [Exit Ars. guarded, Sem. Arsaces, Yes, yes, I come, To snatch thee from thy Chains, or share thy Doom; Thy Virtue, Truth, and Innocence I know; And if I trespass, joy to trespass so: Tho' busy Tongues my Conduct may reprove, I own with Pride the glorious Crime of Love. [Exit Sem. Nican. Well, mischief is on foot; my Master-Part Be now to keep it warm: the blinded King, To heighten the Distrusts my busy Wiles Have sown already in his tortur'd Mind, Must be acquainted with the Son's Disease, But with such shocking aggravating Terms Will I take care to dress the horrid Tale, That boiling Nature shall not have the least Relenting Bent to soften it to Mercy, Or struggle for the mitigated Fault. And see, he comes! but with a Brow, methinks, Would bode but blackly to another Cause, Contriv'd with thinner Artifice than mine; But be it what it may, I stand prepar'd. Enter the King. King. Why, what a Bubble is this Flash of Life! Alike in every Sort, and all Degrees: The servile Hind, that earns with constant Sweat His homely Diet, is esteem'd a Wretch, And as the Drudge of the Creation scorn'd: Monarchs shine forth a while in fairer Light, But to their Cost are taught the fatal Cheat; The more their Cloud of Sorrow seems remote, The more its Fury crushes when it falls; Their Mis'ries come proportion'd to their Height, And if a Diff'rence is in human Lots, The Value lies upon the Peasant's side, Who having least to prize, has least to grieve. But now, each Prospect that I took seem'd fair, And all this Sea of Life one Calm of Joy; And now a Worm is gnawing on my Breast, That tells me, Peace of Mind dwells here no more. [Seeing Nicanor.] Ha! here's the Fiend of Prey that makes my Liver A new Promethean Banquet for his Gorge: Thou Villain, give me, give me back my Son, But lovely as my Fondness saw him first, Thro' all the Whiteness of unsully'd Faith. Nican. I like this Tempest of his hurry'd Mind, It shews the Seeds I've sown have taken Root: If now the Curse of Jealousy is on him, How will he writh with Pangs unutterable, When he shall know the Sickness of his Son Transcends the worst of his suspicious Fears? [Aside. King. What art thou mute? confounded at the Work Of thy own dev'lish Brain? Infernal, speak, Make thy Assertion out, prove, prove him false; Or if 'tis in the power of human Search To furnish Justice with a new Supply Of unexperienc'd Instruments of Vengeance, Equal, if possible, to all the Racks That heave an agonizing Parent's Breast, Dooming and pleading, with alternate Passions, The Crimes and Merits of an only Son; Think, think, and tremble at thy certain Fate. Nican. Thus charg'd, excuse the Slave that dares affirm, If he has cause to tremble, 'tis for you; If he is dead in Thought, 'tis your Distress Imposes on his Mind the honest Weight: The Instruments of Infamy and Death In vain are threatned to the Man, whose Life Is only worn and valu'd for the Power It gives him to discharge his Duty here. King. Trifle not, tell me he is guiltless; save Thy Soul more Sins, and own that thou hast wrong'd him. Nican. You wish him guiltless, and Heaven knows how much I wish, without incurring Guilt myself, I stood a happy Witness that he was. Oh! Sacred Sir, I know th'ungrateful Light In which my forward Zeal presents me to you; I know the Danger to unfold a Truth Too dire, too flagrant for a Father's Ear: I see by all your Actions, Looks, and Words, That you repent the Knowledge of the little I have already, with too honest Rashness, Let wander from my Tongue; then let me die, Stretch'd on the Wheel, or steep'd in liquid Fire, A willing Victim to my Master's Peace, E'er he extort a Secret from my Breast, Which known, will wring him like ten thousand Scorpions; Make ev'ry sev'ral Pang a separate Hell, And never let him taste Repose again. King. O exquisite Tormentor! Hell indeed, Too hot to be endur'd with patient Woe! If thou art honest, quit these Riddle Sounds, Out with this Secret of so black Concern, Out with it; thou hast set me on a Blaze, And thou must quench the Flame, or blow its Rage, To end with speedier Force the Pain it gives. Nican. Shall the soft Fibres of indulgent Nature Be broke, as such must be the dire Event, And I the busy vile upbraided Cause? Shall you have reason to detest the Hour That gave you such a Son? Shall this sad Tale, That labours for Discovery, drive your Horror To curse your Being, and blaspheme your Gods, To throw your wretched Body on the Ground, And tear your venerable Locks in Madness? King. Madness! that Torture is a State of Bliss To the Extravagance of Anguish here. Nican. And yet, hard Conflicts of my honest Mind! This Moment prompts me to unfold the Scene, And this to throw an everlasting Veil Of Secrecy before it. Oh my Heart! Yet may this Son repent, and you forgive. Oh! that there shone the least auspicious Gleam Of such a Hope! but 'tis impossible. Did he aspire to Empire e'er his Call, Ambition, pardonable Fault! in time Might lose its Lust, or Empire lose its Charms. But when from Beauty he derives his Crimes, And lifts his impious Heart to such a Choice, Who dares prescribe the Cure? I can no more. King. Why dost thou sport upon my Torments thus? What Choice, what Love? Is Beauty his Disease? Where shines the high-priz'd Idol of his Heart? Can all our Empire bribe her to his Wish, We give it for his Cure. Nican. Since then my Zeal Will force that from me which your sharpest Engines Should be employ'd an Age to do in vain, The Cause of all his guilty Passion shines Within the Circle of Seleucus' Arms, StratoniceâAnd now the fatal Secret Is burst, with all its Horrors, now requite Which way you please the strict Integrity That drove me to a Task severe as this. I fear, alas! your Sense of such a Wound Will evidence too many flagrant Proofs, To doubt my Faith; or need th'unhappy Tale Should farther be explain'd. King. I thank you, Sir, By the immortal Gods, sincerely thank you: Why, what an able Pillar to a Throne Is such a Statesman? You have probe'd the Sore Thro' which our Empire groan'd: excellent Artist! Fear'st thou I won't believe? This Hour then try; Mark my Revenge, and tell thy Fears they lye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Stratonice and Imene. Ime. Why will your Heart thus fight against itself? Oh why is this Apartment of Despair Your melancholy Choice? Shun, shun, this Place: Seek you repose of Mind? you wander wrong; Here most you lose the Comfort you explore: Let not the Prince's Presence more enflame The Wounds which you can only hope to cure By seeing him no more; resolve on that, Forget his Pains, and you may lose your own. Strat. My Cure, Imene, is already fix'd; My Virtue has prescrib'd the great Receipt To finish my Distress, but not the Power To drive the Prince's Torments from my Mind, Or combat with a Soul, that pants to see The Cause of all its Ruin once again. Yes, yes, I will indulge the horrid Joy Of one last Agony, one parting Pang; One Look of Anguish, and a deep Farewell, And Innocence will sure acquit me there, Since I'm resolv'd, since thus I fix my Doom, To part from him, and my own Life together. Ime. The Gods forbid! Strat. Oh! no, the Gods that look On virtuous Deeds with a delighted Eye, Will own the Greatness of a Mind, that could Resolve so justly, and so bravely dare, And aid the glorious Purpose they approve. I want their Aid, indeed: See, see, Imene, The dreadful Tryal comes! I cannot bear it; My Resolution dies at his Approach, And every Nerve is in rebellious Strife. Enter Antiochus: [Who looks stedfastly some time upon the Queen; in the mean while the King and Nicanor enter on the other side of the Stage, at the upper End.] Nican. Ha! [Starts. King. Wherefore dost thou start? what Griefs hast thou? Thou hast no Son, Antiochus is mine, My bitter Age's Punishment alone. Nican. What evil DÃ¦mon this way led our Steps? Let me entreat your Majesty, retire; Behold your Queen! your Son! you must not stay A Witness to an Interview like this. King. Is't possible! Is Hell then so industrious To save its Agent's Credit by this Proof? And is it not, ye Gods, Curse strong enough, I know I have a Son, and know him false; But I must feel the Punishment of knowing it, Heighten'd by this mask'd Villain's boastful Service? Black Hypocrite! foul Son! most wretched King! Ant. I have confess'd my Crime, yet still persist; I have ask'd pardon of the Gods and you; Yet every Moment of detested Life Still I am fated to deserve it less. I know I stab the very Heart of Nature, I fix Damnation, when my venom'd Breath Is loaded with the guilty Tale of Love; Of Love! to whom, ye Powers? a Father's Wife! Can you forgive me? No, you cannot, shall not, I never can myself; I'll spare the Gods Their feeble Justice, and inflict my own. Strat. I come not to upbraid you with a Guilt, Your Bosom did not of its Choice incur; I know your Virtues, and I grieve to see Those Virtues thus abus'd, and I the Cause. I come to bring you now the Wretch's Alms, Condoling Tears, and sympathizing Woe; I come to pity you, and curse myself. Ant. Surprize! pronounce th'amazing Sound again: You say you come to pity! pity whom? The impious Rival of your Husband's Bed? No, Madam, I must prove ungrateful now, And hold condemn'd your unaccepted Goodness; That Med'cine feeds like Oil, expiring Flames, And kindles Wretchedness to new Desires. Would you do Justice to yourself, or me, To your great Husband's, or your own Renown, Look on me as an Outcast of the Earth, Distinguish'd for the Rankness of my Guilt, And hunted from the Herd of common Men, My Species' Scandal, and my own Disgrace: Think, too forgiving Innocence, Oh! think, Accurst, forlorn, and desperate, as I am, Was it e'en possible my Soul could know Relief from such a Balm, by thy bright Self I swear my Torments should for ever last, E'er take a Respite that thou couldst not give, But at the dear Expence of sully'd Fame. Strat. Oh Sir! Oh Prince! if you are thus accurst, Then tell me what is she, what merits she, From whose malignant Poison-spreading Charms Your Miseries drew their Birth? Have I a Face So fertile of Destruction, yet a Power So small its mighty Mischiefs to atone? You would not take my Pity, gen'rous Sir; Be then more gen'rous still, and give me yours, And judge, whilst thus I ask it, I have need, Sufficient want indeed: I own I'm mad, And mad on your account; your Pangs, your Griefs Wring from me this Confession of my own. Ant. Let feeble Sufferers and dastard Griefs Admit a servile Partnership in Woe; I will extract this Merit from my Sorrows, To take the dreadful Banquet to myself. Whom do I hold this guilty Converse with? All this sad Time I gaze upon your Eyes, I swallow Sulphur, and I swim in Fire. Have you no Husband, or no Father I? Who could behold us thus, and think we had? Strat. Why so, my Lord? Is mourning for our Sins Then sinning on? Th'Unhappy may complain; And we, I'm sure, have Privilege enough, If that may be a Plea. Ant. Beware, beware, I have no Plea, no Shadow of Excuse To palliate the black Sense of having wrong'd The best of Fathers, and involving you, The whitest, as the fairest of your Sex, In the unfathom'd Depth of my Destruction. If you have Charity, I beg you, Madam, Bestow it on yourself; in doing so, The Obligation's half conferr'd on me: Each Moment you stay here, we swell in Sin, I may be still a Slave to wishing on; Then fly Pollution's Commerce, save your Virtue, The Sting, the Taint of guessing what I wish. Strat. I will do more, my Lord, than you advise: These threat'ning fierce Assaults of hostile Guilt, I could not, would not fly, but dare resist. This is the Tryal that my Virtue chose, And let it stand the glorious Combat out, Till from surmounted Toils it rise refin'd, And give its Mistress place among the Stars. Ant. There may you keep your everlasting round, For ever worship'd by the Fair and Chaste; While I in Darkness set a sullen Orb, Invok'd by none but Villains like myself, T'imbitter Rage, and heighten Desperati Strat. No, follow me, I'll teach you better Hopes, And give you noble Proofs I am your Friend; My own Example shall point out the Way, You may be free and spotless as myself. And since I have my Cure, with Pride I own My Passions were as criminal as yours: When first your Tongue disclos'd the dire Effect Of your most impious Love, that very Moment I found we had exchang'd our mutual Ruins; I rav'd, I languish'd with the same Desires; But I've resolv'd on ample Reparation, A most prevailing Penitence indeed! Now, Soul, thy Load is eas'd, no more repine; Guilt ceases to be Guilt, when own'd like thine. [Exit Strat. Ant. Where am I? dare I tell myself I live, And not commit high Blasphemy 'gainst Heaven? Who, e'er it form'd me, with a conscious Eye, Foresaw its own Decree, foresaw this Lot Of everlasting Woe, its cruel Gift Of Life entail'd upon me: Where's the Queen? Talk'd she of Guilt? Impossible! what Claim Can she pretend? I'll not allow it, no, My own black Bosom has so far engross'd Hell's ransack'd Store, there can't be left enough To damn one Wretch beside. [King comes forward, Nicanor following.] Nican. Nicanor, now Finish thy Work. By the King's Looks I find, This Sight has wrought him into full Distraction; His Agonies are all so many Trains Of Death laid ready for my final Touch. Now, Rhetoric, lend thy pois'nous Aid once more, And I'll assure my Hopes compleat Success. King. What dost thou mutter? Ant. Ha! my Father here! Nican. What Nicanor ought, What such a Scene of Horror may excuse, Ten thousand Curses on an honest Fool, Repentance for my Loyalty. King. 'Tis well; Repentance is the Clue that leads to Heaven: Thou'st done me Service, and deserv'st Reward; Then will I take thee in thy Hour of Grace, And send thee to receive it from the Gods; Take this thy Monarch's Present to thy Heart. [Stabs him. Ant. Whence comes this Act of Violence and Blood? Where points my Father's waken'd Fury next? [Aside. King. There's thy curst Pacquet of Credentials back; Thy Minister, Cleartes, has miscarry'd In his important Trust: survey thy Scroll, And find more heinous Matter for Repentance, Than thy dissembled Loyalty. Nican. Confusion! Curst Counterplot of evil-working Chance! My Letters to Lysimachus! 'tis o'er, Since I'm detected, 'tis no matter how, The Labour of Reflection now is vain; Ambitious Minds have yet this Comfort left, E'en in the Instant of their Overthrow, To think they durst aspireâ [Dies. King. So much for Vengeance there, The Monarch's Part is o'er; the next isâwhose? Most dreadful, agonizing Thought! a Father's! My Son, why speak thy Eyes such dire Alarm At this my Act of Justice? Wherefore seems Thy Breast to shudder, as it shar'd the Blow I levell'd only at'a Traytor's Heart? Need I to doubt, when thou shalt hear the Cause, The black Offence, that doom'd his forfeit Life, But that thy grateful Virtue will confess, I acted as a King and Father ought? Suppose thou hear'st he dy'd on thy account? Foul as he was with many Crimes, the Crime That edg'd my Vengeance most, was wronging thee. Ant. Horrid Amazement! fatal black Encounter! What mean my Father's Words? what brings him here? These conscious Tumults of my Rebel Blood Inform me I'm betray'd; betray'd to all Those Racks, those Scourges of severest Shame, Tortures beyond Damnation, that attend The sad Impeachment of my publish'd Crime. King. Yes, yes, Antiochus, thy Crime is known, Thy Father both its Witness, and its Judge; And thus pronouncesâ Ant. If my Sentence, Oh! One Moment stop the dooming Breath of Justice, Not that my Soul can have a Hope so poor, To strive to sooth you to a Thought of Pardon, Or slacken by Delay the baffled Force Of your intended Vengeance; no, Sir, no, This Weed, this Scandal to your sully'd House, This Child, the Curse of your first Marriage-bed, And Rival of your last, will join your Fury; Join to assert an injur'd Father's Cause, And point out such Severity of Justice On myself-punish'd Head, that you shall own, Thro' all the Frenzy of your Wrongs, your poor, Discarded, suff'ring Son, in Death retrieves The Glory of that Name his Life had cancell'd. King. Now, by my vanquish'd Passions, all the Joys That Empire can afford, or Beauty yield, Were endless Curses, and large Draughts of Woe, If put in balance, for the Loss of thee. Oh my Antiochus! in this Embrace, Judge all the utmost Rigour of thy Doom. I here command thee live, the Name of Son Still wear with Worth, and unimpeach'd Honour, At once acquitted by the Gods and me: I've witness'd to the fierce unhappy Flame, That tore thy honest Breast; and in Reward For all the thousand Pangs thy Virtue stood, I here declare Seleucus' Nuptials void, The unenjoy'd Stratonice be thine; Fill with more equal Years the Marriage-bed, Whilst I am happy in the glorious Pride Of conquering thus myself, and blessing you. Ant. Oh! great, miraculous Reverse of Fate! Reproaching Goodness! Rapture too severe! Can I, my Lord, embrace the proferr'd Heaven, And not confounded, sink beneath the Shock, The gnawing Plague of telling to myself How little I deserve it? Gracious Sire, Your Generosity I fear will prove As fatal to me, as Despair before. I'm pardon'd, 'tis too much! Secure of this, This one vast Blessing, 'tis resolv'd I take This noblest Opportunity of dying, Convinc'd the num'rous Hours of lengthen'd Life Have not one guiltless Sweet to give me more. King. These pious Conflicts of thy gen'rous Mind, The more they bid thee shun thy Suff'ring's Cure, The more demand it, as thy Merit's due; Since thy reluctant Honour is thy Foe, Let me remind you there is yet a Sweet In Beauty's Arms worth living to possess; Take from thy Father's Hand, without a Stain, Life and Stratonice. Enter Stratonice. Strat. Stratonice! what Voice Of black Portent, what croaking Note of Fate Is busy with that hapless Name of Woe? Ha! Drugs work sure, and Ruin mend thy Speed. My HusbandâI've renounc'd th'unequal Tie, And triumph in the kind Divorce of Death: Antiochus, thou Loiterer, away, I'm onwards in my Journey to the Stars, And hop'd a Fellow-Traveller in thee. King. What dreadful Act of Terror lies disguis'd In the ill-boding Frenzy of your Words? Strat. A glorious Act, that cannot be recall'd, An Act that e'en thy Justice shall applaud, And After-Ages envy when they hear. Ant. Thou hast not (twenty thousand thousand Deaths! The dire Imagination!) acted aught To wound thy precious Life? Strat. To wound it? no, I've snatch'd it from an Age of certain Infamy, To shine in happier Lights, and purer Worlds. The pois'nous Draught that wastes Life's brittle Frame, Is a rich Cordial to my living Fame; I chose this noblest Method to be free, Since Death alone could shut out Guilt and Thee. [Dies. Ant. Ha! by my Torments, she fulfils her Words, And sinks in Death indeed: Death! Madness! no, Whilst Gods themselves exist, she could not die. Answer me, Father, has our Earth a Bribe, Is it in all your Empire's lavish'd Wealth, To buy the Ransom of this single Life? But Boys are taught to weep, and Cowards rail; The injur'd Brave make head against their Wrongs, Rob Heaven of its anticipated Blow, Strike for themselves, and make their Doom their Choice. [Offering to stab himself.] Enter Arsaces. King. Avert thy bloody Purpose: Ars. Oh my Friend! For ever blasted be the Eyes that see That Dagger level'd at the richest Heart That ever Friendship warm'd, or Honour fed. Ant. For ever blasted be the Eyes that saw The boasted Wealth of the whole Female World In her last Groan expireâAy, there, Arsaces, Survey the beauteous Ruin, judge the Loss Of our impoverish'd Earth, a Lover's Loss, And in a Lover's, mine; then, then confess My Frenzy's Patience. Everlasting Darkness! Where shall I find thy sable Shelter? Oh! [Swoons into Arsaces' Arms, and is carried off.] Ars. Let us support him from this fatal Sight! Unhappy Nuptial Pomp! rich Scene of Woe! King. 'Tis to thy Friendship, gen'rous Prince, we trust The Hopes of his Recovery; the Wrong Thy doubted Honour has a while sustain'd, Has had th'Atonement of the Villain's Blood, That form'd th'injurious Accusation; aught That more remains within a Monarch's power Demand, in Expiation of our Crime: If, as I've heard, thou hold'st Semandra's Charms Worthy thy Love, thou hast her Father's Voice; Live, and be happy, whilst my Griefs indulge A just Despair for the untimely Fall Of this ill-fated Innocence: 'Tis thus The Gods their true Prerogative declare; And when most vain, shew Mortals what they are.
