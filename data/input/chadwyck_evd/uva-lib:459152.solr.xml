      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. A subiect, of no subiect, we present, for No-body, is Nothing: Who of nothing can something make? Jt is a worke beyond the power of wit, And yet inuention is ripe: A morrall meaning you must then expect, grounded on lesser then a shadowes shadow: Promising nothing wher there wants a toong; And deeds as few, be done by No-bodie: Yet something, out of nothing, we will shew, To gaine your loues, to whome our selues we owe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Enter Cornewell and Martianus. Corn. My Lord Martianus. Mar. My Lord of Cornwell. Corn. Morrow. Mar. Morrow, Corn. You are sad my Lord. Mar. You melancholy. Corne. So, The state it selfe mournes in a robe of Wo. Mar. For the decease of Archigalloes vertues, I vnderstand you Noble minded Cornwell, What generous spirit drawes this Brittish ayre, But droops at Archigalloes gouernement. corn. And reason Martianus, when the Sunne Struggles to be deliuered from the wombe Of an obscure Eclipse, doth not the earth Mourne to behold his shine envelloped, O Corbonon when I did close thine eyes, I gaue release to Britaines miseries. Enter Elydure. Mar. Good morrow to Prince Elydure. Elid. The same to you, and you, you are sad my Lordes, your harts I thinke are frosty, for your blood Seemes crvsted in your faces, like the dew In a September morne, how fares the king, Haue you yet bid good morrow to his highnes. Corn. The kings not stirring yet. Enter Uigenius and Peridure. Perid. Yonders old Cornwell, come Uigenius, Weele haue some sport with him. Vig. Brother content. Perid. Good morrow to you brother Elydure. Cornwel, God morrow to Cornwell. Vig. Morrow old gray-beard. Corn. My beards not so gray as your wits greene. Vig. And why so. Perid. We shall ha you come out now with some reason that was borne in my great grandsires time. Corn. Would you would proue as honest princes as your great graundsire was, or halfe so wise as your elder brother was, theres a Couple of you, Sfoote I am ashamed you should be of the blood royall. Perid. And why father vvinter. Corn. You doe not knovv your state, theres Elydure Your elder brother next vnto the King, He plies his booke, vvhen shall you see him trace Lasciuious Archigallo through the streets, And fight with common hacksters hand to hand, To wrest from them their goods and dignityes. Perid. You are to saucy Cornwell. Vig. Bridle your spirit. Elyd. Your words are dangerous, good honest subiect Old reuerent states-man, faithful seruitor, Doe not traduce the King, hees vertuous Or say he tread somewhat besides the line Of vertuous gouernment, his regality Brookes not taxation, kings greatest royalties Are that their subiects must aplaud their deedes, As well as beare them their prerogatiues. Are murall interponents twixt the world, And their proceedings. Corn. Well, well, I haue ferued foure kings, And none of all those foure but would haue ventured Their safeties on old Cornwels constancy, But thats all one, now I am cald a dotard, Go to, though now my limbes be starke and stiffe, When Cornwels dead Brittayne I know will want So strong a prop, Alasse I needs must weepe, And shed teares in abundance, when I thinke How Archigallo wrongs his gouernment. Vig. Nay, now youle fall into your techy humor. Enter Lord Sicophant. Sicoph. My Lords, Princes I should haue said, and after Lords, I am the Vsher and Harbinger vnto the kings most Excellent person and his Maiesty. Uig. Is fourth comming. Sicoph. Or comming fourth, hard by or at hand, will you Put your gestures of attendaunce on, to giue his Maiestie the Bon-ioure. Enter Archigallo and two Lords. Morgan Malgo. All. Good morrow to our soueraigne Archigallo. Arch. Morrow. Corn. Why do you frowne vpon your seruants king, We loue you, and you ought to fauor vs: Will you to Counsel. Heeres petitions, Complaints and controuersies twixt your subiects, Appealing all to you. Arch. Lets see those papers. A controuersie betwixt the Lord Morgan and the Lord Malgo, concerning their Tytles to the Southerne Island. We know this cause and what their titles be. You claime it by inheritance. Morg. My liege I do. Arch. You by the marriage of Lord Morgans mother, To whom it was left ioynture. Malgo. True gratious Soueraigne. Arch. Whose euidence is strongest, to which part Inclines the censures of our learned Iudges. Morgan. We come not heer to plead before your grace, But humblie to intreat your Maiestie, Peruse our euidence and censure it, According to your wisedome. Arch. What I determine then youle yeeld vnto. Both. We will my Soueraigne. Arch. Then that Southerne Ile we take to our protection, and make you Lord gouernor thereof. Sicoph. I humblie thanke your highnesse. Mal. I hope your Maiesty. Arch. Replie not, I but take it to my selfe Because I would not haue dissention betwixt two peeres, I loue to see you friends, And now the Islands mine, your quarrell ends. Whats next. A poore Nothern mans humble petition. Which is the plaintiue? Enter clowne, Wench, and Rafe. Rafe. I if it please your Maiestie I was betrothed to this maid. Arch. Is this true my Wench. Wench. Tis verie true and like your maiestie, but this tempting fellow after that, most felloniously stole my hart awaie fro me, caried it into the church, and I running after him to get my hart againe, was there married to this other man. clown. Tis verie true and like your maiesty, though Raphe were once tooke for a propper man, yet when I came in place it appeared otherwise: if your highnesse note his leg and mine, there is ods, and for a foot, I dare compare, I haue a wast to, and though I say it, that shoulde not saye it there are faces in place of Gods making. Arch. Thou art a proper fellow, and this wench is thine by lawfull marriage. clown. Rafe you haue your answer, you may be gon, your onely way to saue charges, is to buy a halpenniwoorth of Hob-nailes for your shooes: Alasse you might haue looked into this before, go silly Rafe go, away, vanish. Arch. Is not this Lasse a pretty Neat browne Wench? Sicoph. She is my liege, and mettell I dare warrant. Arch. Fellow, how long hast thou been married? Clown. I was as they say coupled the same day that my country man Raphe begunne the law: for to tell your Maiestie the truth, we are yet both virgins, it did neuer freese betwixt vs two in a bed I assure your grace. Arch. Didst neuer lie with thy wife? Clown. Neuer yet, but nowe your Maiestie hath ended the matter Ile be so bold as take possession. Arch. Harke my wench, wilt leaue these rusticke fellowes &amp; stay with me? Wench. What will your highnes doe with me? Arch. Why Ile make thee a Lady. Wench. And shall I goe in fine clothes like a Lady. Arch. Thou shalt. Wench. Ile be a Lady then, thats flat, sweet heart farewell, I must be a Lady, so I must. Clow. How now, how now, but heare you Sis. Wench. Away yon Clowne, away. Clown. But will your highnes rob me of my spouse. Arch. What we will, we will, away with those slaues. Clown. Zounds, if euer I take you in Yorkshire for this. Sicoph. Away you slaues. Corn. My Lord, these generall wrongs will draw your highnesse into the common hatred of your subiects. Arch. Whats that to thee, old doting Lord forbeare. Whats heere? complaints against one Nobody. For ouermuch releeuing of the poore, Helping distressed prisoners, entertayning Extrauagants and vagabonds, what fellowes this? Corn. My liedge I know him, he's and honest subiect That hates extortion, vsury, and such sinnes As are too common in this Land of Brittaine. Arch. Ile haue none such as he within my kingdome, Hee shall be banisht. Sicoph. Heare my aduise my liedge: I know a fellow Thats opposite to Nobody in all thinges: As he affects the poore, this other hates them, Loues vsurie and extortion. Send him straight Into the Country, and vpon my life, Ere many monthes he will deuise some meanes To make that Nobody bankrout, make him flie His Country, and be neuer heard of more. Arch. VVhat doost thou call his name. Sicoph. His name is Sombody my liedge. Arch. Seeke out that Sombody, wele send him straight, VVhat other matters stay to be decided Determine you, and you, the rest may follow To giue attendance. Exeunt all but the Lords. Manent Cornwell and Martianus. Mart. Alls nought already, yet these vnripe ills Haue not their full growth, and their next degree Must needes be worse then nought, and by what name Doe you call that? Cornw. I know none bad enough: Base, vild, notorious, vgly monstrous, slauish, Intollerable, abhorred, damnable; Tis worse then bad, Ile be no longer vassaile To such a tirannous rule, nor accessarie To the base sufferance of such out-rages. Mart. Youle not indure it, how can you remedie A mayme so dangerous and incurable? Corn. There is a way; but walls haue eares and eyes, Your eare my Lord, and counsell. Mart. I haue eares Open to such discourse, and counsell apt: And to the full recouery of these wounds Made in the sicke state, most effectuall, A word in priuate. Enter Peridure and Uigenius. Perid. Come brother, I am tyrde with reuelling, My last Caranta made me almost breathlesse, Doth not the Kings last wench foote it with art? Uige. Oh rarely, rarely, and beyond opinion. I like this state where all are Libertines But by ambitions pleasure and large will: See, see, two of our strict liu'd Counsellors In secret conference; they cannot indure This freedome. Perid. Nor the rule of Archigallo, Because tis subiect to his libertie. Are they not plotting now for some installement And change of state: old gallants if you be Twill cost your heads. Vige. Bodies and all for me. List them, such strict reproouers should not liue, Their austere censures on their kings to giue. Corn. He must be then deposd. Perid. Ey, are you there, that word sounds treason. Uig. Nay, but farther heare. Mart. The King deposd, how must it be effected, What strengths and powers can sodenly be leuied, VVho will assist this busines, to reduce The state to better forme and gouernment? Uig. Ey mary, more of that. Corn. All Cornwells at my becke, Deuonshire our neighbour Is one with vs, you in the North commaund. The oppressed, wrongd, deiected and supprest, Will flocke on all sides to this innovation: The Clergie late despisd, the Nobles scornd, The Commons trode on, and the Law contemnd, Will lend a mutuall and combyned power Vnto this happie change. Peri. Oh monstrous treason! Mart. My Lord, we are betraide, and ouer-heard By the two princes. Corn. How, betraide. Mart. Our plots discouered. Corn. Ile helpe it all; doe you but sooth me vp, Wele catch them in the trap they lay for vs. Mart. Ile doot. Corn. Now sir, the king deposd Who shall succeede? Mart. Some would say Elidure. Corn. Tush, he's too milde to rule. But there are two young princes, hopefull youths And of rare expectation in the Land, Oh would they daigne to beare this weightie charge Betwixt them, and support the regall scepter With ioynt assistance, all our hopes were full. Uig. A Scepter. Perid. And a Crowne. Mart. What if we made the motion? we haue wills To effect it, we haue power to compasse it. Uig. And if I make refusall, heauen refuse me. Perid. These Counsellors are wise, and see in vs More vertue then we in our selues discerne. Would it were come to such election. Corn. My honord Lord, wele breake it to those princes, Those hopefull youths, at our conuenient leasure. Mart. With all my hart. Corn. You that our footsteps watcht, Shall in the depth of your owne wiles be catcht. Exeunt. Uig. A King. Perid. And were a crowne, a crowne imperiall. Uig. And sit in state. Perid. Commaund. Vig. And be obeyed. Perid. Our Nobles kneeling. Uig. Seruants homaging, and crying Aue. Perid. Oh brother, shall we through nice folly Despise the profferd bountie of these Lords? Uig. Not for the world, I long to sit in state, To purse the bountie of our gracious fate. Perid. To entertaine forreine Embassadors. Vig. And haue our names ranckt in the course of kings. Perid. Shadow vs State with thy maiesticke wings. Enter King, Cornwell, Martianus, and Elidure. Vige. Now sir, my brother Archigall deposde Corn. Deposd! did you heare that my Lord. Uig. For his licensious rule, and such abuses As wele pretend gainst him in parliament. Arch. Oh monstrous brothers. Elidu. Oh ambitious youthes. Vig. Thus wele diuide the Land, all beyond Trent And Humber, shall suffise one moitie: The southpart of the Land shall make the tother, Where we will keepe two Courts, and raigne deuided, Yet as deere louing brothers. Arch. As vild traitors. Perid. Then Archigall, thou that hast fat in pompe And seene me vassaile, shalt behold me crownd, Whilst thou with humble knees vailst to my state. Arch. And when must this be doone, when shall my crowne Be parted and deuided into halfes. You raigne on this side Humber, you beyond The riuer Trent, when doe you take your states, Sit crownd and scepterd to receiue our homage, Our dutie, and our humble vassalage. Perid. I know not when. Arch. Nor you? Vige. Nor I. Arch. But I know when you shall repent your pride. Nor will we vse delayes in our reuenge, Ambitious boyes, we doome you prisonment, Your Pallace royall shall a Jaile be made, Your thrones a dungeon, and your scepters Trons, In which wele bound your proude aspiring thoughts: Away with them, we will not mount our chayre Till their best hopes be changd to blacke despaire. Perid. Heare vs excuse our selues. Uige. Or lets discouer Who drew vs to this hope of soueraigntie. Arch. That shall our further leysures arbitrate, Our eares are deafe to all excusiue pleas, Come vnambitious brother Elidurus, Helpe vs to lauish our abundant treasures, In masks, sports, reuells, riots, and strange pleasures. Exeunt: Enter Sombody with two or three seruaunts. Somb. But is it true the fame of Nobody, For vertue, almes-deedes, and for charitie, Is so renownd and famous in the Country? Seru. Oh Lord sir ey, hes talkt of farre and neere, Fills all the boundlesse country with aplause, There liues not in all Britaine one so spoke of, For pittie, good mind, and true charitie. Somb. Which Sombody shall alter ert be long. Seru. You may my Lord beeing in grace at Court, And the high fauours of King Archigallo Exile this petty fellow from the Land, That so obscures the beautie of your deedes. Sombod. VVhat doth this Nobody? Seru. You shall heare my Lord, Come twentie poore men to his gate at once, Nobody giues them mony, meate and drinke, If they be naked, clothes, then come poore souldiers, Sick, maymd, and shot, from any forraine warres, Nobody takes them in, prouides them harbor, Maintaines their ruind fortunes at his charge, He giues to orphants, and for widdowes buildes Almes-houses, Spittles, and large Hospitals, And when it comes in question, who is apt For such good deedes, tis answerd Nobody. Now Nobodie hath entertaind againe Long banisht Hospitalitie, and at his boord A hundred lustie yeomen daily waites, Whose long backs bend with weightie chynes of biefe, And choise of cheere, whose fragments at his gate Suffice the generall poore of the whole shire. Nobodies table's free for trauellers, His buttry and his seller ope to all That starue with drought, or thirst vpon the way, Somb. His fame is great, how should we helpe it? Seru. My Lord, tis past my reach, tis you must doe it, Or't must be left vndone. Somb. What deedes of note is heels famous for? Seru. My Lord Ile tell you. His Barnes are full, and when the Cormorants And welthy Farmers hoord vp all the graine, He empties all his Garners to the poore Vnder the stretcht prise that the Market yeelds, Nobody racks no rents, doth not oppresse His tenants with extortions. When the King Knighted the lustie gallants of the Land, Nobody then made daintie to be knighted, And indeede kept him in his knowne estate. Somb. The slaues ambitious, and his life I hate. Seru. How shall we bring his name in publick scandall? Sombo. Thus it shall be, vse my direction. In Court and country I am Sombody, And therefore apt and fit to be employed: Goe thou in secrete beeing a subtile knaue. And sowe seditious slaunders through the Land, Oppresse the poore, suppresse the fatherlesse, Deny the widdowes foode, the staru'd releefe, And when the wretches shall complaine their wrongs, Beeing cald in question, sweare twas Nobody, Racke rents, raise prises, Buy vp the best and choise commodities At the best hand, then keepe them till their prises Be lifted to their height, and double rate, And when the raisers of this dearth are sought Though Sombody doe this, protest and sweare Twas Nobody fore Iudge and Magistrate: Bring scandalls on the rich, raise mutinous lyes Vpon the state, and rumors in the Court, Backbite and sow dissention amongst freends, Quarrels mongst neighbors, &amp; debate mongst strangers, Set man and wife at ods, kindred at strife, And when it comes in question, to cleere vs, Let euery one protest and sweare for one, And so the blame will fall on Nobody. About it then, if these things well succeede, You shall preuaile, and we applaude your speede. Enter Nobody and the Clowne. See where he comes, I will withdraw and see, The euent and fortunes of our last pollicie. Nobod. Come on myne owne seruaunt, some newes, some newes, what report haue I in the country? how am I talkt on in the Citty. and what fame beare I in the Court? Clowne. Oh Maister you are halfe hangd. Nobod. Hangd, why man? Clowne. Because you haue an ill name: a man had as good almost serue no Maister as serue you, I was carried afore the Constable but yesterday, and they tooke mee vp for a strauagant; they askt mee whom I serued, I told them Nobody, they presently drew mee to the post, and there gaue me the law of armes. Nobody. The law of armes. Clow. Ey, as much lawe as their armes were able to lay on, they tickled my Collifodium, I rid post for a quarter of an houre, with switch though not with spurre. Nobod. Sure Sombody was the cause of all. Clow. Ile be sworne of that, Sombody tickled me a heate, and that I felt, but Maister, why doe you goe thus out of fashion; you are euen a very hoddy doddy, all breech, Nobod. And no body. But if my breeches had as much cloth in them, as euer was drawne betwixt Kendall and Canning street, they were scarce great enough to hold all the wrongs that I must pocken Fie, fie, how I am slaunderd through the world. Nobody keepes tall fellowes at his heeles, Yet if you meete a crew of rogues and beggars, Aske who they serue, theile aunswere Nobody. Your Caualiers and swaggerers bout the towne, That dominere in Tauerns, sweare and stare, Vrge them vpon some termes, theile turne their malice To me, and say theile fight with Nobody, Or if they fight, and Nobody by chaunce Come in to part them, I am sure to pay for it, And Nobody be hurt when they scape scotfree: And not the dastardst coward in the world But dares about with me. What shall I doe? Somb. Doe what thou wilt, before we end this strife, Ile make thee tenne times weary of thy life. Clown. But doe you heare Maister, when I haue seru'd you a yere or two, who shall pay me my wages? Nobo. Why Nobody. Clowne. Indeede if I serue Nobody, Nobody must pay me my wages, therefore Ile euen seeke out Sombody or other, to get me a newe seruice; but the best is Maister if you runne away, you are easie to be found againe. Nobod. Who so sir? Clowne. Mary aske a deafe man whom hee heares, heele straight say Nobody, aske the blindest beetle that is whom hee sees, and heele aunswere, Nobodie, hee that neuer saw in his life can see you, though you were as little as a moate, and hee that neuer heard, can heare you, though you treade as softlie as a Mouse, therefore I shall be sure neuer to loose you. Besides, you haue one commoditie Maister, which none hath besides you, if you should loue the most fickle &amp; inconstants wench that is in the world, sheele be true to Nobody, therefore constant to you. Nobod. And thou sayest true in that my honest seruaunt, Besides, I am in great especiall grace With the King Archigallo that now raignes In tiranny, and strange misgouernment, Nobody loues him, and he loues Nobody. But that which most torments my troubled soule, My name is made mere opposite to vertue, For he is onely held peacefull and quiet, That quarrels, brawles, and fights with Nobody, He's honest held that lies with Nobodies wife, And he that hurts and iniures Nobody, All the world saies, ey thats a vertuous man. And though a man haue doone a thousand mischiefes, And come to proue the forfeit made to law, If he can proue he hath wrong'd Nobody, No man can touch his life. This makes me mad, This makes me leaue the place where I was bred, And thousand times a day to wish me dead. Somb. And Ile pursue thee where so ere thou fliest, Nor shalt thou rest in England till thou diest. Clowne. Maister, I would wish you to leaue the Country, and see what good entertainement you wil haue in the Cittie, I do not think but there you will be most kindly respected, I haue been there in my youth, there's Hospitalitie, &amp; you talke of Hospitalitie, and they talke of you bomination to see: for there Maister come to them as often as you will, foure times a day, and theyle make Nobody drinke, they loue to haue Nobody trouble them, and without good securitie they will lend Nobody mony. Come into Birchin Lane, theyle giue Nobody a sute, chuse where hee list; goe into Cheapeside, and Nobody may take vp as much plate as he can carrie. Nobod. Then Ile to London, for the Country tires me With exclamations, and with open wrongs, Sith in the Cittie they affect me so. Clowne. O Maister, there I am sure Nobody may haue anie thing without mony, Nobody may come out of the Tauerne without paying his reckoning at his pleasure. Enter a man meeting his wife. Nobody. Thats better then the Country. Who comes heere? Man. Minion, where haue you been all this night? Wife. VVhy doe you aske husband? Man. Because I would know wife. Wife. I haue beene with Nobody. Nobod. Tis a lie good man, beleeue her not, shee was not with mee. Man. And who hath layne with you to night? Wife. Lye with mee, why Nobody. Nobod. Oh monstrous, they would make me a whore-maister. Man. Well, I doe not thinke but Sombody hath been with you. Sombo. Sombody was indeed. Wife. Gods life husband, you doe me wrong, I lay with Nobody. Man. Well minion, though Nobody beare the blame, Vse it no more, least Sombody bide the shame. Nobod. I will endure no longer in this Clymate It is so full of slaunders, Ile to the Cittie, And there performe the deedes of charitie. Enter the 2 man and a prentice. 2 Man. Now you rascall, who haue you beene withall at the ale-house? Prent. Sooth I was with Nobody. Nobod. Not with me. 2 Man. And who was drunke there with you? Prent. Sooth Nobody was drunke with me. Nobod. O intollerable! they would make me a drunkard to, I cannot indure any longer, I must hence, No patience with such scandals can dispence. 2 Man. Well sirra, if I take you so againe, Ile so belabour you: O neighbour good morrow. 1 Man. Good morrow, 2 Man. You are sad me thinkes, 1 Man. Faith sir I haue cause, I haue lent a friend of mine a hundred pounde, and haue Nobodyes worde for the payment, bill, nor bond, nor any thing to shew. 2 Man. Haue you Nobodies worde, Ile assure you that Nobodie is a good man, a good man I assure you neighbor, Nobodie will keepe his worde, Nobodies worde is as good as his bond. 1 Man. By, say you so, nay then lets drinke downe sorrow, If none would lend, then Nobody should borrow. Nobody. Yet there's one keepes a good tongue in his head, That can giue Nobody a good report, I am beholding to him for his praise: But since my man so much commends the Cittie, Ile thether, and to purchase me a name, Take a large house of infinite receipt, There keepe a table for all good spirits, And all the chimneyes shall cast smoake at once: There Ile giue schollers pensions, Poets gold, Arts their deserts, Philosophy due praise, Learning his merrit, and all worth his meede. There Ile release poore prisoners from their dungeons. Pay Creditors the debts of other men, And get my selfe a name mongst Cittizens, That after times pertakers of all blisse, May thus record, Nobody did all this. Country farewell, whose slaunderous tongues I flie, The Cittie now shall lift my name on hie. Sombody. Whether Ile follow thee with Swallowes wings, And nimble expedition, there to raise New brawles and rumors to eclipse thy praise. Those subtile, slie insinuating fellowes Whom Sombody hath sent into the country, To rack, transport, extort, and to oppresse, VVill I call home, and all their wits employ Against this publique Benefactor, knowne Honest, for all the rumors by vs sowne. But howsoeuer, I am sworne his foe, And opposite to all his meriting deedes, This way must doe, though my deuining thoughts This augurie amidsts their changes haue, That Sombody will at length be proou'd a knaue. Exeunt. Enter Queene, Sicophant, and Lady Elidure seuerallie. Sicoph. Good day to you both faire Ladies, But fairest of them both my gratious Queene, Good day to your high Maiestie, and madam The royall Lady of great Elidure, My Soueraignes brother, vnto you I wish This morning prooue as gracious and as good. Queene. Those greetings from the Lady Elidure VVould pleasingly sound in our princely eares. Lady. Such greetings from great Archigalloes queene VVould be most gratious to our princely eare. Queene. What no good morrow and our grace so neere. Reach me my gloue. Lady. VVhom speakes this woman to? Queene. Why to my subiect, to my waiting maid, Am not I mightie Archigalloes queene? Is not my Lord the royall English King, Thy husband and thy selfe my seruitors? Lady. Is my Coach ready, where are all my men That should attend vpon our awfull frowne, VVhat not one neere? Queen. Minion, my gloue. Sicoph. Madam, her highnes gloue. Lady. My scarfe is falne, one of you reach it vp. Queene. You heare me. Lady. Painted Maiestie be gone, I am not to be countercheckt by any. Quee. Shall I beare this? Sicoph. Be patient, I will schoole her. Your excellence greatly forgets your selfe To be so dutilesse vnto the Queene, I haue seene the world, I know what tis to obey, And to commaund. What if it please the Queene That you her subiect should attend on her, And take her gloue vp, is it meete that I Should stoope for yours? You're proud, fie, fie, you're proud. This must not be twixt such two royall sisters As you by marriage are; goe to submit, Her Maiestie is easie to forgiue. Lady. Sawcie Lord forbeare, there's for your exhortation. Queene. I cannot beare this, tis insufferable, Ile to the King, and if he saue thy life He shall haue mine: madnes and wrath attend, My thoughts are leueld at a bloody end. Exit. Lady. Shee's shadow, We the true substance are: follow her those That to our greatnesse dare themselues oppose. Enter Cornwell, Martianus, Morgan and Malgo. Cornw. Helth to your Ladiship, I would say Queene If I might haue my minde, bir lady Ladie. Mart. I had a sute vnto the King with this Lord For the great office of high Seneshall, Because of our good seruice to the state, But he in scorne, as he doth euery thing, Hath tane it from vs both, and gin't a foole. Morg. To a Sicophant, a courtly parasite. Sicoph. Beare witnes Madam, Ile goe tell the King That they speake treason. Malgo. Passe vpon our swords, You old exchecker of all flatterie, I tell thee Archigallo shall be deposd, And thou disroab'd of all thy dignitie. Sicoph. I hope not so. Cornw. See heere the Counsels hands, Subscrib'd to Archigallos ouerthrow. The names of sixteene royall English Peeres, Ioynd in a league that is inviolate, And nothing wants but Elidurus grant To accept the kingdome when the deede is done. Sicoph. Nay then Ile take your parts, and ioyne with you. Mart. We will not haue a Clawbacks hand comixt With such heroick peeres. Sicoph. I hope my Lady Is not of their minds. My most gratious Queene, What I did speake in reprehensiue sort, Was more because her Maiestie was present Then any offence of yours, and so esteeme it, God knowes I loue your highnes, and these Lords. Lady. VVhich of you will perswade my Elidure To take vpon him Englands royaltie. Mart. Madam, we all haue so importund him, Laying vnto his iudgement euery thing That might attract his sences to the crowne, But he frost braind will not be obtaind To take vpon him this Realmes gouernment. Malg. Hee is the verie soule of lenitie, If euer moderation liu'd in any, Your Lord with that rich vertue is possest. Lady. This mildnes in him makes me so despisd By the proude Queene, and by her fauourits. Enter Elidure. Cornw. See maddam where he comes reading a booke. Lady. My Lord and husband, with your leaue this booke Is fitter for an Vniuersitie Then to be lookt on, and the Crowne so neere: You know these Lords for tyrannie haue sworne To banish Archigallo from the throne, And to invest you in the royaltie: VVill you not thanke them, and with bounteous hands Sprinckle their greatnes with the names of Earles, Dukes, Marquesses, and other higher termes. Elid. My deerest loue, the essence of my soule, And you my honord Lords, the sute you make, Though it be iust for many wrongs imposd, Yet vnto me it seemes an iniurie. VVhat is my greatnes by my brothers fall, But like a starued body nourished With the destruction of the other lymbes. Innumerable are the griefes that waite On horded treasures, then much more on Crownes: The middle path, the golden meane for me, Leaue me obedience, take you Maiestie. Lady. Why this is worser to my lofty minde, Then the late checks giuen by the angry Queene. Corn. If you refuse it, knowe we are determined To lay it else where. Lady. On your younger brother, And then no doubt we shall be awde indeed, When the ambition of the elders wife, Can scarsly giue our patience any bounds: England is sicke of pride and tirrany, And in thy goodnes only to be curde. Thou art cald foorth amongst a thousand men, To minister this soueraigne Ancidote, To amend thy brothers crueltie with loue, And if thou wilt not from oppression free Thy natiue Country, thou art vilde as he. Elid. I had rather stay his leasure to amend. Lady. Men, heauen, gods, deuills, what power should I invoke, To fashion him a new: thunder come downe, Crowne me with ruine, since not with a Crowne. Cornw. Long life vnto the Kingly Elidure, Trumpets proclaime it whether he will or no. Lady. For that conceit Lords, you haue wonne my hart, In his despight let him be straight waies Crownd, That I may triumphe whilst the trumpets sound. Elid. Carry me to my graue, not to a Throne. Lady. Helpe Lords to seate him, nay helpe euery one: So should the Maiestie of England sit, Whilst we in like state doe associate him. Elid. Neuer did any lesse desire to raigne Then I, heauen knowes this greatnes is my paine. Lady. Paine me in this sort great Lords euery day, Tis sweete to rule. Elid. Tis sweeter to obay. Cornw. Liue King of England long and happily, As long and happily your Highnes liue. Lady. We thanke you Lords, now call in the deposd, Him and his proud Queene, bring vnto our sight, That in her wrongs we may haue our delight. Enter Archigallo, and his Queene bound. Archi. Betrayd, tane prisoner, and by those that owe To me their duty, and allegiance: My brother the vsurper of the Crowne, Oh this is monstrous, most insufferable. Elid. Good brother grieue not, tis against my will, That I am made a King, pray take my place, I had rather be your subiect then your Lord. Lady. So had not I, sit still my gracious Lord, Whilst I looke through this Tyrant with a frowne, Minion reach vp my gloue. Queene. Thinkst thou because Thy husband can dissemble piety, And therein hath deposd my royall Lord, That I am lesser in estate then Queene? No thine owne answere lately giuen to me, I thus reuer, stoope thou proud Queene for me. Sicoph. Nay, then as I did lately to her Highnes, I must admonish you, diected Lady You doe forget your selfe, and where you are, Duty is debt, and it is fit since now You are a subiect, to beare humble thoughts: Follow my counsell Lady and submit, Her Maiestie no doubt will pardon it. Queene. Theres for your paines. Sicoph. Which way so ere I goe, I haue it heere, whether it ebbe or flowe. Lady. That pride of thine shall be thy ouerthrowe. And thus I sentence them. Elid. Leaue that to me? Lady. No you are too mild, iudgment belongs to me: Thou Archigallo for thy tirranie, For euer be excluded from all rule. And from thy life. Elid. Not from his life I pray. Lady. He vnto whom the greatest wrongs are done, Dispatch him quickly. Morg. That will I. Maglo. Or I. Elid. And therein Lords effect my tragedie. Lady. Why strike you not, oh tis a dangerous thing, To haue a liuing subiect of a King: Much treason may be wrought, when in his death, Our safty is secur'd. Elid. Banish him rather, oh sweete spare his life, He is my brother. Archi. Crownd, and pray thy wife. Elid. Oh brother, if you roughly speake, I knowe There is no hope but your sure ouerthrowe, Pray be not angry with me for my loue: To banishment since it must needes be so, His life I giue him whosoere saies no. Lady. What and his Ladies to. Elid. I hers and all. Lady. But Ile not haue you banisht with the King, No Minion no, since you must liue, be assur'd Ile make thee meanest of my waiting Maides. Queene. I scorne thy pride. Archi. Farewell deceiuing state, Pride making Crowne, my deerest wife farewell: I haue beene a Tyrant, and Ile be so still. Exit. Elid. Alas my brother. Lady. Dry vp childish teares, And to these Lords that haue inuested you, Giue gracious lookes, and honorable deedes. Elid. Giue them my Crowne, oh giue them all I haue, Thy Throne I reckon but a glorious graue. Lady. Then from my selfe these dignities receiue, The Iland wrested from you I restore, See it be giuen them backe Lord Sicophant. The office of hie Seneschall bereft you, My Lord of Cornwell to your grace we giue. You Martianus be our Treasurer, And if we find you faithfull, be assur'd You shall not want preferment at our hands. Meane time this office we impose on you, Be Tutor to this Lady, and her pride With your learnd principles whereof you are full Turne to humility, or vex her soule, Queene. Torment on torment, tutord by a foole. Sicoph. Madam, it is her Highnes will be pleas'd. Lady. Young Peridurus and Vigenius, Lords Release from prison, and because your King, Is mightely affected vnto Yorke, Thether dismisse the Court incontinent. Sicoph. Shall it be so my Liedge. Lady. Are not we King. His silence saies it, and what we ordaine, Who dares make question of: this day for euer Thorough our raigne beheld a festiuall: And tryumphe Lords that England is set free, From a vild tyrant and his crueltie: Elid. On to our funerall, tis no matter where, I sinne I knowe in suffering pride so neere. Exeunt. Enter Nobody, and the Clowne. Nobody. Ahem boy, Nobody is sound yet for all his troubles. Clow. And so is Nobodies man for all his whipping, but Maister we are nowe in the Citty, wald about from slaunder, there cannot a lie come in but it must runne thorough bricke, or get the goodwill of the warders, whose browne bills looke blew vppon all passengers. Nobody. O this Citty, if Nobody liue to be as old againe, be it spoken in secret, Ile haue fenst about with a wall of brasse. Clowne. Of Nobodies making, that will be rare. Nobody. Ile bring the Tems through the middle of it, empty Moore-ditch at my owne charge, and build vp Paules-steple without a collection. I see not what becomes of these collctions. Clowne. Why Nobody receaues them. Nobody. I knaue? Clowne. You knaue: or as the world goes, Somebody receiues all, and Nobody is blamd for it. Nobody. But is it rumord so thorough out the Citty. Clowne. Doe not you knowe that? theres not an orphants portion lost out of the Chamber, but Nobody has got it, no Corne transported without warrant, but Nobody has donne it, no goods stolne but by Nobody, no extortion without Nobody: and but that truth will come to light, fewe wenches got with child, but with Nobody. Nobody. Nay thats by Somebody. Clowne. I thinke Somebody had a hand in't, but Nobody sometimes paies for the nursing of it. Nobody. Indeede I haue taken into my charge many a poore infant left to the almes of the wideworld, I haue helpt many a vertuous maide to a good husband, &amp; nere defird her maiden-head: redeemed many Gentlemens lands, that haue thankt Nobody for it, built Pest-houses, and other places of retirement in the sicknes time for the good of the Cittie, and yet Nobody cannot get a good word for his labor. Clowne. Tis a mad world Maister. Nobody. Yet this mad world shall not make me mad, I am All spirit, Nobody let them grieue, That scrape for wealth I will the poore relieue, Where are the Maisters of the seuerall prisons: Within and neere adioyning to the Citty, That I may spred my charity abroad. Clowne. Heere they be Sir. Enter three or foure. Nobody. Welcome Gentlemen: You are they that make poore men housholders Against their wills, and yet doe them no wrong: You haue the actions, and the cases of your sides, Whilst your Tenants in comon, want money to fill them. How many Gentlemen of lesse reuenewes then Nobody, Lie in your Knights ward, for want of maintenance. 1. I am Sir a Keeper of the Counter, and there are in our wards aboue a hundred poore prisoners, that are like nere to come foorth without satisfaction. Nobody. But Nobody will be their benefactor. What in yours. 2. As many as in the other prison. Nobody. Theres to release them. What in yours. 3. Double the number, and in the Gayle. Nobody. Talke not of the Gayle, tis full of limetwigs, lifts, and pickpockets. 1. Is it your pleasure Sir to free them all. Nobody. All that lie in for debt. 2. Ten thousand pound, and ten to that will not doe it. Nobody. Nobody Sir will giue a hundred thousand, Ten hundred thousand, Nobody will not haue a prisoner, Because they all shall pray for Nobody. Clowne. Tis great pitty my Maister has Nobody, and so kind a hart. A noise within. Follow, follow, follow. Nobody. What outcries that? Enter Somebody, with two or three. Somebody. That is the gallant, apprehend him straight, Tis he that sowes sedition in the Land, Vnder the couler of being charitable, When search is made for such in euery Inne, Though I haue seene them housd, the Chamberlaine For gold will answere there is Nobody: He for all bankrouts is a common baile, And when the execution should be serud Vpon the sureties, they find Nobody: In priuate houses who so apt to lie, As those that haue beene taught by Nobody, Seruants forgetfull of their Maisters friends, Being askt how many were to speake with him Whilst he was absent, they say Nobody, Nobody breakes more glasses in a house, Then all his wealth hath power to satisfie: If you will free this Citty then from shame, Sease Nobody, and let him beare the blame. Const. Lay hold vpon him. Nobody. What on Nobody, giue me my sword, my morglay, My friends, you that doe know how innocent I am, Draw in my quarrell, succor Nobody, What Nobody, but Nobody remaining. Clowne. Yes Maister, I Nobodies man. Nobody. Stand to me nobly then, and feare them not, Thy Maister Nobody, can take no wounds, Nobody is no coward, Nobody Dares fight withall the world. Somb. Vpon them then. A fight betwixt Somebody and Nobody, Nobody escapes. What has he scapt vs. Const. He is gone my Lord. Somb. It shall be thus, now you haue seene his shape, Let him be straight imprinted to the life: His picture shall be set on euery stall, And proclamation made, that he that takes him, Shall haue a hundred pounds of Sombody, Country and Citty, I shall thus set free, And haue more roome to worke my villanie. Exeunt. Nobody. What are they gonne, then Citty now adew, Since I haue taken such great iniury, For my good life within thy gouernment: No more will Nobody be charitable, No more will Nobody relieue the poore, Honor your Lord, and Maister Somebody, For Somebody is he that wrongs you all. Ile to the Court the changing of the ayre, May peraduenture change my iniuries, And if I speede no better being there, Yet say that Nobody liu'd euery where. Exit. Enter Archigallo. Archi. I was a King, but now I am slaue, How happie were I in this base estate, If I had neuer tasted royaltie: But the remembrance that I was a King, Vnseasons the Content of pouertie, I heare the hunters musicke, heere Ile lie, To keepe me out of sight till they passe by. Enter Morgan, and Malgo. Morgan. The stag is hearded, come my Lord Shall we to horse and single him againe. Malgo. Content, the King will chase, the day is spent And we haue kild no game, to horse, away. Exeunt. Enter Elidure. Elid. Hearded, goe single him, or couple straight, He will not fall to day, what fellowes this. Archi. I am a man. Elid. A banisht man I thinke, My brother Archigallo, ist not so. Archi. Tis so, I am thy brother Elidure, All that thou hast is mine, the Crowne is mine, Thy royaltie is mine; these hunting pleasures Thou doost vsurpe: ambitious Elidure I was a King. Elidu. And I may be a wretch: poore Archigallo, The sight of thee that wert my Soueraigne, In this estate, drawes riuers from mine eyes. VVill you be king againe? if they agree Ile redeliuer all my royaltie, Saue what a second brother and a subiect Keepes in an humble bosome, for I sweare The Crowne is yours that Elidure doth weare. Arch. Then giue it me; vse not the common sleights, To pittie one, and keepe away his right. Seest thou these ragges, doe they become my person? O Elidure, take pittie on my state, Let me not still liue thus infortunate. Elidu. Alas, if pittie could procure your good, Insteed of water, Ide weepe teares of blood To expresse both loue and pittie: say deere brother I should vncrowne my selfe, the angry Peeres VVill neuer let me reach the imperiall wreathe To Archigalloes head. There's ancient Cornwell, Stout Martianus, Morgan, and bold Malgo, From whom you tooke the pleasant Southerne Ile, VVill neuer kneele to you: what should I say, Your tirannie was cause of your decay. Arch. What shall I die then? welcome be that fate Rather then still liue in this wretched state. Enter Cornwell, Martianus, Morgan and Malgo. Corn. Yonders the King; my soueraigne you haue lost The fall of a braue stagge, he's dead my liedge. VVhat fellowes this? Elidu. Knowest him not Cornwell? Corn. No my liedge not I. Arch. I am thy King. Elid. Tis Archigallo man. Corn. Thou art no king of mine, thou art a traytor, Thy life is forfeit by thy stay in Brittaine. VVert thou not banisht? Elidu. Noble Cornwell speake More gently, or my piteous hart will breake, Lord Martianus, Morgan, and the rest, I am a wearie of my gouernment, And willinglie resigne it to my brother. Mart. Your brother was a tyrant, and my knee Shall neuer bow to wrong and tirannie. Elid. Yet looke vpon his misery, his teares Argue repentance; thinke not honourd Lords The feare of dangers waiting on my Crowne Makes me so willing to resigne the same, For I am lou'd I know, but iustice bids I make a resignation, tis his right, My calls but vsurpation. Corn. Elidure, If you are wearie of your gouernment, Wele set the Crowne vpon a strangers head Rather then Archigallo. Harke ye Lords, Shall we make him our King we did depose, So might our heads be chopt of, Ile loose mine Ere my poore Country shall endure such wrongs, As that iniurious tyrant plagues her with, Mor. Keepe still your Crowne my Liedge, happy is Brittaine Vnder the gouernment of Elidure. Arch. Let it be so, Death is the happy period of all woe. The wretch thats torne vpon the torturing wrack, Feeles not more deuilish torment then my hart. When I but call to minde my tirannie, I record heauen my Lords, my brothers fight, The pittie that he takes of my distresse, Your loue and true allegiance vnto him, Hath wrought in me a reconciled spirit, I doe confesse my sinne, and freely say, I did deserue to be deposd. Elidu. Alas good Prince, my honorable Lords, Be not flint-harted, pitty Archigallo, I know his penitentiall words proceede From a remorcefull spirit, Ile ingage My life vpon his righteous gouernment. Good Cornwell, gentle Martianus, speake, Shall Archigallo be your king againe? Arch. By heauen I not desire it. Elidu. See my Lords, Hee's not ambitious, as thou lou'st me Cornwell, As thou-didst loue our Father, let his sonne Be righted, giue him backe the gouernment You tooke from him. Corn. VVhat should I say? faith I shall fall a weeping: Therefore speake you. Elid. Lord Martianus speake. Mart. What say these Lords that haue been wrongd by him. Elidu. Morgan and Malgo, all I haue in Brittaine Shall be ingag'd to you, that Archigallo Will neuer more oppresse you, nor impose Wrong on the meanest subiect in the Land. Morg. Then weele embrace his gouernment. Elidu. Saies Malgo so? Malg. I doe my Lord. Elidu. What saies Martianus? Mart. Faith as my Lord of Cornwell. Corn. I say that I am sorry he was bad. And now am glad hee's chang'd; his wickednes We punisht, and his goodnes there's great reason Should be rewarded; therefore Lords set on To Yorke then, to his Coronation. Elidu. Then happie Elidurus, happie day That takes from me a kingdomes cares away. Arch. And happie Archigallo that haue rangd From sin, to sin, and now at last am changd.

Queene. Now minion, Ile cry quittance with your pride, And make you stoope at our imperiall fide: But tell me Morgan by what accident You met with my beloued Archigallo? Morg. Euen in the woods where we did hunt the stagge, There did the tender harted Elidure Meete his distressed Brother, and so wrought By his importunate speech with all his Peeres, That after much deniall, yet at last They yeelded their allegiance to your Lord, Whom now we must acknowledge our dread King, And you our princelie Queene.

I shall turne Laundresse now, and learne to starch, And set and poke, and pocket vp such basenes As neuer princesse did: did you obserue What lookes I cast at Elidure my husband? Sicoph.

Queene. Now as you loue me let no helping hand Preserue life in me, I had rather die Then loose the title of my soueraigntie. Lady. Take backe your Distaffe yet, wele stay our rage, We will forbeare our spleene for charitie And loue vnto the dead, till you haue hearsd Your husbands bones, conduct her Lords away, Our pride though eager, yet for foode shall stay.

Enter Queen and Lady.

My Lord of Cornwell, whose that whispers to you? Or whats the newes? Corn. My liege, he tels me heeres a great contention betwixt two noted persons of the Land much spoke of by all states, one some-body Hath brought before your highnes and this presence, An infamous and strange opiniond fellow, Cald No-body, they would intreat your highnes, To heare their matters scand. Elid. Weele sit in person on their controuersies, Admit them Cornwell. Lady. Is that strange monster tooke, so much renownd, In Citty, Court, and Country, for lewd prancks. Tis well, weel heare how he can purge himselfe. Enter some-body, bringing in No-body and his man, with Billes and staues. Som. now sirrha we haue brought you before the King, Wheres your hart now? Nob. My harts in my hose, but my face was neuer ashamed to shew it selfe, yet before king or Keyser. som. And wheres your hart sirrha? Clowne. My harts lower then my hose, for mine it at my heel, but whersoeuer it is, it is a true hart, and so is not somb. som. Health to your Maiestie, and to the Queene, With a hart lower then this humble earth whereon I kneele. I beg against this fellow, Iustice my liege. Eli. Against whom. som. Against No-body. No. My liege, his words wel sute vnto his thoughts, He wishes no man Iustice, being composd Of all deceit, of subtilty and slight, For mine own part, if in this royall presence, And before all these true iudiciall Lords, I cannot with sincerenes cleare my selfe, Of all suggestions falsly coynd against me, Let me be hangd vp sunning in the ayre, And made a scar-crow. Mar. Lets heare his accusations, And then how well thou canst aquit thy selfe. som. First, when this monster made his residence Within the country, and disperst his shape Through euery shire and country of the Land, Where plenty had before a quiet seat, And the poore commons of the Land were full, With rich abundance and saciety, At his ariue, great dearths aud scarsity, By ingrosing corne, and racking poore mens rents. This makes so many poore and honest Farmers, to sell their leases, and to beg their bread, this makes so many beggers in the Land. Corn. I but what proofe or lawfull euidence Can you bring forth, that this was done by him. som. My Lord I tras't him, and so found him out, But should your Lordship not beleeue my proofe, Examine all the rich and wealthy chuffes, Whose full cramd Garners to the roofes are fild, In euery dearth who makes this scarsitye, And euery man will clearely quit himselfe, Then consequently, it must be No-body. Base copper money is stampt, the mine disgrast, Make search who doth this, euery man cleares one, So consequently it must be No-body. Besides, whereas the nobles of the land, And Gentlemen built goodly manner houses, Fit to receiue a King, and all his traine, And there kept royall hospitality, Since this intestine monster No-body, Dwels in these goodly houses keepes no traine, A hundred Chimnies, and not one cast smoke, And now the cause of these, mock-begger Hal, Is this they, are dwelt in by No-body, For this out of the countrey he was chast. No. My royall liedge whie am I thus disgrast, Ile proue that slandrous wretch hath this al done. Elid. Tis good you can acquit you, such abuses, Growe in the countrey, and vnknowne to vs: nay then no maruell that so manie poore, starue in the streets and beg from doore, to doore. Then sirha purge you from this countrey blame, Or we will make thee the worlds publike shame. Corn. now No-body, vvhat can you say to this. Clo. My M. hath good cards, on his side Ile vvarant him. No. my Lord, you knovv that slanders are no proofes, nor vvords without their present euidence, If things were done, they must be done by some-body, Else could they haue no being. Is corne hoorded, some-body hords it, else it would be delt, In mutuall plentie throughout all the land, Are their rents raisd, if No-body should doe it, then should it be vndone, Is Base money stampt, and the kings letters forgd, Some-body needes must doe it, therefore not I, And where he saies, great houses long since built, Lye destitute, and wast because inhabited, By No-body my liedge, I answer thus, If Some-body dwelt therein, I would giue place. Or wold he but alow those chimnies fire, They would cast cloudes to heauen, the Kitchin-foode It would releeue the poore, the sellers beere, It would make strangers drinke, but he commits These outragies then laies the blame on me, And for my good deed, I am made a scorne. I onely giue the tired a refuge seat, The vnclothd garments, and the starued meate. Clow. How say you by this maister Some-body. I beleeue you will be found out by and by. Corn. If this be true my liedge, as true it is, Some-body will be found an arrant cheater, Vnlesse he better can acquit himselfe. Sich. Touch him with the citty, since you haue taken the foile in the Countrey. Mar. Sirha, what can you say to this? Someb. What should I saie my Lord, see heare complaints, Made in the citty against no-body, As well as in the country. Sue their bils, Heeres one complaines his wife hath bin abroad, And asking where she reuels night, by night, She answers she hath bin with no-body. Heares queanes maintaind in euery suburb streete, Aske who maintaines them, and tis no-body. Watches are beaten, and Constables are scoft, In dead of night men are made drunke in touernes, Girles loose their maiden heads at thirteene yeares, Pockets pickt, and purses cut in throngs. Queene. Inough, inough, doth no-body all this? Though he hath cleard himselfe from country crimes, He cannot scape the citty. No. Yes dread Queene, I must confesse these things are daily done, For which I heere accuse this Some-body, That euery where with slaunders dogs my steps, And cunningly assumes my borrowed shape, Women lie out, if they be tooke and found with somebody, then No-body goes cleere, Else the blames mine, he doth these faults vnknowne, then slanders my chast innocence for proofe. somebody doth maintaine a common strumpet ith Garden-allies, and vndid himselfe. somebody swaggered with the watch last night, was carried to the counter. somebody once pickt a pocket in this Play-house yard, Was hoysted on the stage, and shamd about it. Clow. Ha, ha, hath my maister met with you. no. Alasse my liege, your honest No-bodie Builds Churches in these dayes, and Hospitals, Releeues the seuerall prisons in the Citty, Redeemes the needy debtor from the hole, And when this somebody brings infant children, And leaues them in the night at strangers doores, Nobody fathers them, prouides them nurses, What should I say, your highnes loue I craue, That am all iust. corn.

False dice and Cheating brought euen to the presence, and who dares be so impudently knauish, Vnlesse some fellow of your name and garbe. Morg.

      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue. Heer if you wonder why the king Elidurus bestowes nothing on me for all my good seruices in his land, if the multitude shuld say he hath preferd No-body, Some-body or other would say it were not well done, for in doing good to No-body he should but get himselfe an il name. Therefore I will leaue my sute to him, and turne to you. Kinde Gentleman if any-body heere dislike No-body, then I hope Euery-body haue pleased you, for being offended with no-body, nor Any-body can finde himselfe agrieued, Gentlemen they haue a cold sute that haue no-body to speak in their cause, and therefore blame vs not to feare, yet our comfort is this, if no-body haue offended you cannot blame No-body for it, or rather we will finde Some-body heareafter shall make good the fault that no-body hath done, and so I craue the generall grace of Euery-body. Eli. now forward Lords, long may our glories stand, Three sundry times Crownd king of this faire land. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
