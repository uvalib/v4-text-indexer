      <field name="fulltext">XIMENES; A TRAGEDY</field>
      <field name="fulltext">?Nature might stand up, And say to all the World;âThis was a Man! Shakespeare.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD THURLOW, LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND; THE FOLLOWING TRAGEDY OF XIMENES (WHO WAS, MANY YEARS, CONNECTED WITH A COURT, YET ALWAYS PRESERVED A SPIRIT OF INDEPENDENCE; WHO ADMINISTERED EQUITY, WITH THE MOST CONSCIENTIOUS IMPARTIALITY; WHO, IN THE MOST TRYING JUNCTURES OF AN ACTIVE AND ARDUOUS LIFE, WAS DETERMINED, AND INTREPID) IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED, BY HIS LORDSHIP'S OBLIGED, AND MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT, THE AUTHOUR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PROLOGUE; Written by the Authour. Exalted virtue on our stage appears, To-night; and owes more majesty to years; May it your plaudits win, if not your tears! Sure all who hear me, have perused the reign Of the famed lord of Germany, and Spain. But who regrets not a recording page, Zealous for Charles, neglectful of the sage? Where, of the tyrant a full-length we see; And, Ximenes! a miniature of thee! Tutored by time, and watchful to repress A muse, once prone to juvenile excess; Ardent to praise, and tender to condemn, We leave grave history to it's prudent phlegm; Yet say, what poet would not rather sing The generous regent, than the gloomy king? Our venerable hero's life you'll find Of strain harmonious with a British mind; By genius taught, three hundred years ago, To lawless power a persevering foe, At length, he broke the despot's Gothick chain, And introduced humanity to Spain; For her, vindictive hosts he oft defied, The fierce resentment of Castilian pride; For her, a tear oft stealing, with a sigh, Suffused the language of a speaking eye; Her cause gave spirit to his latest breath, And turned attention from the shaft of death. Since then to you, respectful in his aim, By noble means our bard aspires to fame; Hither no sing-song, trifling object brings, Of you unworthy, and Castalian springs; Requests your leave to plead a generous cause, The patronage of arts, and equal laws; Religion, freed from every priestly guile, And beaming, with her own celestial smile; Since he presents no common tragick theme, Enlarged by wild imagination's dream; But wishes, for awhile, the soul distressed With woes that stung a dying patriot's breast; Woos you, from tricks to wean your eye, your ear, To feel, to think, to reason, while you hear; With his exertions let your zeal conspire; And with the British, aid the poet's fire; Assert the taste of a superiour age; And to old dignity restore the stage. Then shall our authour boast a new renown, A mitre friendly to his laurel crown; The church's lights, that still, with distant rays, Like his Arcturus, viewed his cheerless days, Shall see the rigour of their frozen reign Contrasted with the splendid warmth of Spain; Struck with the rare example, they shall own A strong prelatick influence, long unknown, A Christian glory from Toledo's throne!</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter Lopez, and Giraldo. Lopez. Yes;âthough, perhaps, my warmth is cooled by years, Yet I love thine, Giraldo: may it kindle, Whene'er thy bosom feels thy country's glory! Even it's excess I love; that generous flame Forms the good citizen; the gallant soldier. What an auspicious Ã¦ra marks our days! For seven long ages did the Moors pollute Our Christian soil; nay, ruled our Christian sons! But Heaven crowned all our toils; our plans; our trophies; Our unextinguished valour, faith unshaken, With never-fading laurels, or with palms More sacred, from the moment when the cross Waved on the high Alhambra! Giraldo. And who, Lopez, Was evidently sent, as Heaven's vicegerent, To crown our Spanish policy, and arms, With a bright series of success, and triumph, Who, but our glorious regent?âAt the image, Or name of Ximenes, my soul takes fire, Inflamed with civick pride, flushed with the virtue, And honour of Castile! Lopez. A juster cause, Giraldo, never can awake thy ardour. In varied scenes, propitious to fair fame, He shines, with equal, and unrivalled lustre: Whether he seeks, with piety sincere, In the recesses of his chesnut-grove, The pure, exalted pleasures of devotion; Or whether he revisits Alcala; And, there, improves the walks of literature; Gives to the liberal arts his warm protection, Minerva's more serene, sublimer province; Blending his laurel with the peaceful olive;â Or, if we view him in the royal palace, The confessor, the counsellor, of kings; The grateful voices of united Spain, With the true patriots's warmth, would bear me witness, How nobly he adorns his dignities. Giraldo. Genius, like other energies of nature Of mighty force, subdues her weaker powers, And moulds it's ductile captives to it's will: It's keen, and active spirit supersedes The true advantages of birth, and fortune; It conquers, with it's ardent perseverance, The prejudices, the malicious arts Of human kind; and with it's inspiration, Diverts, and breaks, the painted bubble, fashion, Admired, and followed, by the vulgar throng. Our cardinal evinced it's faculties Intuitive, it's quick, and charming magick. A pious monk, from a secluded cell, And from secluded shades, inspired by genius, Knew, in a moment, how to rule the world. Lopez. And yet his conquest of Oran (a conquest, Which Ferdinand, though born, and trained, a hero, Would never have presumed to meditate) To which, planned by himself, he led, in person, Gives the most burnished, and resplendent page Of his eventful, and bright history. Giraldo. The real enterprize was so aspiring, So picturesque, that to my mind it brings My young, and beauteous dreams of chivalry. Heavens! can I ere forget (thou knowest, I served, Too young a volunteer, in that campaign!) How my great master in all noble arts, Tempered, from unexampled self-controul, Giving fair scope to judgment, his high spirit, With the calm style adapted to the juncture! Blended his claim to absolute command With mild expostulation's gentler empire; And thus composed, and moulded to his purpose, Two mutinous, and desperate myrmidons, Raised by himself to highest warlike honours, The ruffian of Navarre, and Vianelli! Can I forget the new, and awful sight, That struck my boyish fancy, and will warm With youthful fire, my frost of hoary age! A reverend prelate, with impassive soul, Then only more august by seventy years, And habited in robes pontifical; Addressing, in the van, our listening army, With force of language irresistible, And with as powerful majesty of manner! His varied speech inflaming, now, the soldier With earthly honours; now, with those rewards That mock the waste of time; that are eternal, Inspired the faithful with a holy zeal, And love of glorious deeds, unfelt before. Lopez. No wonder, that the valour was determined, And conquered all before it, which was fired, At once, by eloquence, and by religion! Giraldo. At first, I imaged to myself, our troops Led by a legate sent us from the skies. And as undisciplined imagination Is fertile to create, and to combine Quickly successive, and fantastick pictures, In fleeting scenes, I to my mind recalled What I had read of Rome's illustrious worthies. One while, our chieftain was my pious Numa, Next, my Camillus; then, my Cincinnatus. Lopez. Giraldo, I'm enamoured with thy portrait, Faithful, at once, and vivid; when the virtues, And talents (various both) of our great man, Are thus collected to one point of view, With double energy, they strike the mind. Giraldo. My hero is as amiable as great; Famed for the practice of humanity. When Ximenes, with Pedro of Navarre, Entered Oran, subdued, and desolate, Through walls of slaughtered Moors; the pious victor Felt his proud conquest fade; 'twas, in his breast, Changed into grief, and horrour; tears adorned His venerable face; with look severe, He to his warriour turned:ââOh! why, Navarre, âSo prodigal of blood? The Moors were men, âOur natural brothers; and, perhaps, ere long, âHad been our brethren in the Christian faith! âAll human triumphs have their dark alloy. âEach mortal stab superfluously given âTo them; given in wild, military ravage, âIs a heart's wound to me.â Lopez. This anecdote, Reflecting brighter fame than any laurel, That e'er encircled a victorious brow, Flows, in soft harmony with all his conduct, In social, civil, and religious life. And would this father of a grateful country, Who, though his soul is generous, and humane, Almost beyond example, can be stern, At the command of justice, and severe, Almost with heavenly awe; would he resolve To quell his charming tenderness of nature, For the state's good, and in religion's cause; With firmness to atchieve one glorious deed; I'd almost learn indifference to the names Recorded in our holy calendar; And he should be my tutelary saint! Giraldo. What action, Lopez, can thy mind imagine Too great for his performance? Lopez. You know Zaigri? Giraldo. The famous Moorish prince, the gallant captive, Now in Granada, whom fair Leonora, The daughter of Medina's duke, esteems Too highly; who, at Munda's well-fought battle (Munda, where empire has been thrice Ad Mundamâcastra Punica mota: et Romani eÃ² confestim secuti sunt. Ibi signis collatis pugnatum per quatuor ferme horas; egregiÃ¨que vincentibus Romanis, signum receptui est datum, quÃ²d Cneii Scipionis femur tragulÃ¢ confixum erat; pavorque circa eum ceperat milites, ne mortiferum esset vulnus. CÃ¦terÃ¹m haud dubium fuit, quin nisi ea mora intervenisset, castra eo die Punica capi potuerint. Livy, B. xxiv. ch. 42. disputed!) Sprung from his tent, forgetting malady, To save his royal father, old Abdallah, Pressed by a host of foes? Lopez. I mean the same. Giraldo. What conduct dost thou wish, from Ximenes, To Zaigri? Lopez. 'Tis my wish, that the good prelate Would make a convert of his royal friend; Would, for this end, exert a kind compulsion; With true regard, would force him to be saved. To sacrifice our present ease, is virtue. What various good would Ximenes effect, By feeling, for a while, the pangs of friendship! His conscience ever would approve the deed; His friend's eternal weal would be secured; And thousands added to the Christian world! Giraldo. How superstition steels a heart humane! And ranks oppressive with angelick deeds! Have you to learn the regent's character? I know him; he's a prodigy complete; A churchman; yet he's not a hypocrite; A churchman; yet he riots not in power; A churchman; yet he most delights in mercy. Yes; when the sun, propitious to our clime, With wintry aspect rules the jocund spring, A Ximenes will persecute a Zaigri. Lopez. Surely, all means are worthy of our praise, Which bring mankind within the church's pale. I fear, Giraldo will reject my tenet. And if I was not, now, too long detained, But with great pleasure to myself, I'd hear thee, Well-pleased, even on this topick: from Alonzo, Our regent's secretary, I've received A message; my attendance it requires. Different opinions, on important subjects Are not with friendship incompatible. Farewell, Giraldo. Giraldo. Lopez, fare you well. [Exit Lopez. Giraldo, alone. âSurely, all means are worthy of our praise, âWhich bring mankind within the church's pale!â Curse on the doctrine!âOh! benignant heaven! Is not my execration ratified By those eternal laws that spring from thee; Laws coexistent with the first of beings! If Ximenes could wound a Zaigri's conscience (I feel it base, to form the supposition!) All my sincere encomium I'd retract; I'd give it to the winds.âHe, who torments Our mortal part, formed with acute sensations, Is a fell tyrant: but the wretch who tortures Our frame ethereal; who, with sacrilege Never to be forgiven, presumes to check The free, celestial spirit; who would chain The mind, inspired by reason's heavenly ray; Endowed with power discursive, or to choose, Or to refuse;âthe wretch, who bids the bloom Of conscience wither (conscience, the good man's empire!) âWho racks the soul; is, surely, more a tyrant; More a refiner on barbarity. The culprit lives on earth, supremely hated; And, when he dies, hell's fiercest fiends receive him. For him, there is no hope of purgatory. His soul, whose essence is, the dross of evil, No penal fires can ever purify! [Exit Giraldo. SCENE II. Alonzo, Secretary to Ximenes, sitting at a Table; Ink, Paper, Books, before him. Alonzo, alone. Our noble regent's illness, every moment Fast brings him to the confines of the grave: A loss irreparable I shall grieve, Soon as his breath expires; the gentlest master, And the most generous friend;âbut what am I? Spain, and the Indies, when our regent dies, Will lose a father! A Servant enters. Sir, two gentlemen; The one from Florence, from the capital Of England comes the other; and they wish A private interview with Ximenes. Alonzo. You have their names? Servant. Randolfo, Sir, and Audley. Alonzo. They've been expected long; first, show them hither. [The Servant returns with Audley and Randolfo; leaves them, and retires. Alonzo proceeds. Most worthy Sirs, you're welcome to Granada; Thrice welcome, in the name of Ximenes I knew you well before you entered Spain; Your high repute in learning; to these realms You come, to realize a noble object; To cultivate the human mind with arts Ingenuous; to co-operate with one, Whose heart, and talents, even excell his station. Audley. Your welcome, Sir, is civil; it is courtly; I now expect a greeting to receive From Ximenes himself; at his desire, Warmly repeated, we have left the land Where first we saw the light; and whence, mankind, Seldom, but for some great and cogent reason, Are voluntary exiles. Alonzo. Sir, the cause, Why, now, our regent is invisible, Except to those who smoothe the bed of sickness, I'm sorry to announce; a painful illness, And obstinate, presses him hard to-day; Sinks all his faculties; and will, I fear, Ere long, put out Spain's brightest luminary. Randolfo. The melancholy tidings that you give us Of one, whose virtuous fame is spread o'er Europe, Are, to the good afflictive; we shall wait, Till Heaven is more propitious to our visit. Audley. Waiting, with servile patience, on the great, Perhaps may suit the policy of Florence; But we, rough, honest sons of Saxon freedom, Never lose sight, or never ought to lose it, Of man's original equality. Yet, we are not barbarians; to invade The languid hour of sickness; and to urge It's pressure, is remote from my intention. I know the virtues of Spain's cardinal; But I would have it known, on what foundation My mind was fixed, when I took leave of England. I left it, with a full, and firm resolve To do my duty; that, while I performed, I felt that he, who, with man's best ambition, Devotes his life to learning, and to virtue, Deserves esteem and friendship, even from kings. Thus Horace, though, sometimes, to freedom's foes He deigned to offer incense, thought, and acted; And thus, Augustus, though he shackled Rome. Alonzo. Persue that strain, till we forbid it, here. Audley. Then, doubtless, I proceed with greater pleasure. The mind, enriched with intellectual stores, And in that wealth delighting, will assert The rights of liberty and independence, Whether it dwells in Britain, or Iberia. Few are it's wants; the subjugated senses Dare not insult it with their low desires: And why doth he persue, why idolize Sublime examples, but into his soul To work their greatness; and from them to learn, With equal spirit, ever to distinguish The bold decisions of our pride, and caprice, From Heaven's eternal, and it's just decrees? Alonzo. Thy speech, ingenuous Englishman, transcribes The very heart, and soul of Ximenes. Why, he has, now, for fifty glorious years, Been toiling, watching, risking every danger, In all the sacred rights of human nature; In the great charter issued from Heaven's court, To equalize our subjects.âWould you walk Some minutes on the terrace; from that door It lies; I long to bring congenial spirits Together; you shall soon from me receive A message. [Exit Alonzo. Randolfo. For your own advantage trust me; By flexibility alone, good Audley, We can expect (though strong our other titles) Ease with the world, and favours from the great. Audley. A conscious, rational, immortal being; A being, who should owe his satisfaction, His raptures of existence, to his God, And to himself alone, had better want That flexibility, however specious The fruits it brings, than in his bosom bear The mortifying sense, that he has acted, Even for an hour, the hypocrite, and slave. [Exeunt Audley and Randolfo. SCENE III. Enter Leonora and Lucinda. Lucinda. No, Leonora; on thy wounded mind I never shall, in vain, obtrude the dictates Of cold, abstracted reason; that stale nostrum, That panacea with philosophers, Who, in the mass, and pomp confused of study, Perversely, never read the page prescribed, The page of most importance, human nature. Too well I know the power of love to thwart it. 'Tis, in the tenour of its general action, Soft, and persuasive; 'tis, to all appearance, Humane, submissive, and a foe to tumult; It is a gentle, pleasing melancholy. But rouze it by some rude external cause, That oft inopportunely supervenes, To chafe its placid, and translucent current; Then, in its rage, it tears, it drives the soul; It is resistless as the whirlwind's force. Rather I would advise thee, in thy breast, Fair virtue's sacred mansion, to preserve Inviolate the pure, empyreal flame; With all its fears; with those anxieties Which love is doomed to suffer, lest its raptures Give to an earthly pilgrim too much bliss: Rather I would advise thee to survey The future blooming scenes that are displayed By Hope's auspicious hand; and oft we find The promises of Hope performed by time. Leonora. How my Lucinda's pleasing accents soothe me! In unison they flow with my fond wishes; They flow in unison with Zaigri's voice! Thy doctrine is his own; and, sure, it pours Sweet adulation in the ear of Love. Oft he has told meââGentle Leonora, âCalm be thy bosom; for its perturbations âMust ever torture mine: our mutual passion â(Whatever to oppose me, might be urged, âIn haughty tone, by prelates, or by muftis) âHath innocence, and virtue for its basis; âAnd while we keep it fixed on this foundation, âIts guardian is the universal God, âWho, to effect his will, annihilates âThe prejudices, and the power of man. âIn him, and time confide; his providence, âOft slowly, as his wisdom planned its progress, âBut ever, surely, is matured by time.â Lucinda. Then let thy friend's and lover's kind remonstrance Compose thy harrassed mind, and to thy fancy (Thy fancy not erroneous) break the bars, Only by fear strengthened to adamant, The awful, but the temporary bars 'Twixt happiness, and thee! Leonora. Trust me, Lucinda, Thy counsel I respect; revere my duty Of resignation to the will of Heaven. Yet I'm a being of the human species, And for those objects which attach my soul, Must have my doubts, fears, and anxieties. What formidable foes annoy my rest! Revenge, ambition, and fell institution, Still more a tyrant than the other two, O'er nature's peaceful, and innoxious laws; Her laws benevolent; sources divine Of all true, permanent felicity! These cruel foes by day corrode my quiet, A sickly hue diffusing o'er my life; And oft, by night, invade me in a dream; Some motley chaos of disordered fancy. Of late, in feverish, interrupted slumbers, Incongruous, and contrasted scenes I imaged:â Our Andalusia ravaged by the Moors; And yon Alhambra in its former splendour, And I delighted in the revolution; For Zaigri, as I thought, o'er fair Granada The sceptre swayed, with me, a turbaned queen! But this fine spell was, in a moment broken. From that rich plain, to an Arabian desart, Methought, we were transported; mixed with merchants And pilgrims, in a helpless caravan, Dying with thirst, and hunger; soon a vortex Of burning sand arose; which, whirled with fury, Wrapped us in death, and ended all our woes! Lucinda. The dreadful phantoms, which, in dreams, alarm us, Should not disturb the waking, reasoning mind. Come, Leonora, let thy friend console thee:â Hast thou a friend, by her experienced woes, More privileged than I, to recommend A mind that can, by moral discipline, Exalt itself above solicitude? Thou knowest, that, in Alphonso's virtuous love, I was supremely blest; my youthful soldier Was wounded, and expired, before Oran. But ere he died, he wrote me an adieu, Concise, indeed, in words, but in its pathos, A most affecting funeral oration. âI go, Lucinda, to prepare a bower, âIn the blest region, for two faithful lovers; âA bower of myrtle, and celestial palms! âI fear, thy image, almost equally, âDivided, with my God, my parting soul.â While the farewell I read, a torpor seized me; A stupefaction, from the sudden blow. Then, tears of love embalmed the hallowed paper: Next, I looked up to Heaven's omniscient eye; To Providence, my father, and my judge; Whose presence awed me to restrain my tears; Lest I had given Alphonso's memory, In grief's excess, too querulous a tribute. Leonora. So strongly doth Lucinda paint her fortune, That while I hear it, I forget my own. Lucinda. Then, with the sacred sympathy of friendship, Let us resolve to blend our softened sorrows; Softened by reason, and by resignation. Let us retire to thy delightful arbour, Which overlooks Granada's fertile plain, That glows with all the brightest tints of nature, And all her fragrance breathes. There, the lute's note Shall undulate on Zephyr's balmy wing: The sun descending; the pure sky of Spain; Trees, fruits, and flowers; the varied sweets of nature, With musick shall unite congenial powers. These objects tune the soul; with gentle raptures, They purify it from the servitude To care, and passion; elevate our wishes Above the province of capricious fortune; Transport us to a mount, whose glorious summit Virtue hath crowned with never-fading bloom! SCENE IV. Enters Torquemada, the Inquisitor General, alone. The Christian pale is, every hour, enlarged; And, every hour, are hereticks diminished. Six thousand Korans, the licentious warrants Of lawless love, and desolating conquest, Are, by my order, as the church's sentence, Now burning in Granada's royal square. Since I enjoyed my high, tremendous office, Not a few stubborn Jews, and impious Moors Have in the flames expired: but, to reflect, How infinite of proselytes the number, Gained to our faith by charitable force, Redeems the rigour of our inquisition; Nay, proves it a criterion of salvation, Appointed under Heaven's own auspices. True; these benevolent severities Alarm, and wound the sentiments of nature, That feminine opposer of the saint; But, sure, the kindness of religion bids us Torture the body, to ensure the soul. And what is genuine practical religion? 'Tis, with stern discipline, to quell the tumults Of our importunate, rebellious feelings. 'Tis, from whatever pleasures most delight us, Most firmly to abstain;â'tis, for the good Of our immortal spirits, to inflict, Deaf to mean pity, on ourselves, and others, Spontaneous, and involuntary pains: It is, to wage perpetual war with nature; To draw, with priestly power, with heavenly magick, Down, on the meretricious bloom of fancy, A deep, a sable, yet celestial cloud; In which, as in the prophet's car of vapour, We shall ascend the skies!âA thought, now, strikes me; And it shall have effect:âit will contract Satan's dire influence, and enlarge the kingdom Celestial.âNot a contumacious power On earth, shall check my firm, and great resolve; No, not the menace of our mighty regent, Urged with imperial majesty of sway;â A politician singularly great; But a most tame, and despicable prelate. Enters Giraldo. Giraldo. What dost thou meditate, mild Torquemada! Perhaps, with Christian meekness, to compell Some unbeliever to accept salvation? Not, with a fruitless, though fraternal patience, Which our Messiah ne'er exemplified, To wait the slow, but radical effects, Of cogent argument, of soft persuasion; But with a quick, and more decisive process, To plant the horrid stake; to pile the faggots; To light the fire, and burn him into heaven? Torquemada. In language less irreverent, less familiar, One of the most abandoned laity Might have accosted me, by Providence, And thy superiours, in this earthly kingdom, The guardian constituted, the chief patron Of Christian truth. Giraldo. Were not the theme too grave, I should return thy arrogance with laughter.â But deign from me, thou leader of the faithful, To hear some serious, and important truth. A Moor, though hated, though despised, by thee, Who worships, as his father, and his judge, The Power Supreme; who, just in all his conduct, Extends his equity, his deeds benign, Even to humanity's remotest verge; This man, I tell thee, is, in fact, a Christian; And thou art Antichrist! Torquemada. Protect me, Heaven! What dreadful blasphemy assails my ear! An advocate for infidels, for Moors! Does not earth shake, and open, to devour us? I quit the dangerous, the polluted spot! [Exit Torquemada. Giraldo, alone. A murrain seize your herd! You call yourselves The servants of the heavenly Prince of Peace; And half the miseries that afflict mankind, Originate from you!âFather of mercies! Thy pure, celestial precepts, did they flow Through human life, through action, would diffuse Comfort, and happiness, around the world! Thy true religion, all, beneficence, The soul illumines with perpetual sunshine; Gives, to her persevering votaries, The unaffected smile, the vivid hope, Even 'midst the strong antipathies of nature; Even on the borders of the dreary grave. But this religion, hideously transformed By priests, embitters, poisons all the welfare Of individuals, and of commonwealths: It might, without hyperbole, be termed An extirpation of humanity! [Exit Giraldo. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. On one Side of the Stage enters Zaigri, with three Moorish Prisoners in Chains; to them, on the other Side of the Stage, advances Ximenes. Ximenes. To Ximenes when Zaigri's name's announced, A bright assemblage of the fairest virtues Inspires my fancy; I forget the pressure Of age, and sickness, and, awhile, seem strung With all the vigour of my youthful days. What is thy present wish, that I can serve? Too much thou never canst desire of me; For to thy friendship; to it's active zeal, I owe my life.âBut say; who are these captives? Zaigri. The leaders of the late alarming tumult, Whose fury aimed it's action at thy life. To thee I bring them; and not more, from zeal For Ximenes, than from my ardent love Of universal justice. These bold culprits Have impiously profaned a solemn treaty; Profaned the hallowed olive-shade of peace; And against thy existence have directed Their blind revenge. To show that thou art worthy Of different treatment, I'll not, meanly, now, Recite thy conduct with elaborate praise; For well I know that we alike despise Whatever can be construed adulation. But, from a single fact, mistaken men, Unless you're dead to every generous virtue, It must be evident that you're the foes Of one, whose merits if you rightly knew, You would not wish his life abridged, but lengthened, With numerous years, beyond our mortal span. When from your rage I undertook to rescue This great, undaunted patriot, and to lodge him Safely within the walls of our Alhambra, He perseveringly refused my offer; And with his friends he vowed that he would die. Then, let the punishment by Ximenes Himself be named, of lawless criminals, Who were impatient to deprive the world Of it's first virtues. Ximenes. Thy regard for me, Most generous Zaigri, hath too strongly imaged Their guilt, and my desert: the pungent feelings, The vigorous action of resistless nature, Will still predominate; no policy; No power can quell them. These unhappy Moors May plead great provocation to their outrage. Our measures have been fatal to your kingdom: We've burned the Koran of these men, by thousands: I like them better for their violence, Than if they tamely had endured their masters. Loose them, and let them go;âstrike off their fetters. Heaven is my witness; though I'm deemed severe, And supercilious; would the weal of Spain Proceed, without the awe of rigid justice, Without that awe, would wickedness reform, I would not make a captive in these realms, Except a grateful, honourable train, Bound only by the golden chain of mercy. Zaigri. What say my prisoners? your conqueror, You find, is far humaner than your prince. 1st Captive. I, from the present workings of my soul, Oh! Zaigri, for myself, can fully answer. And if o'erflowing sentiment, in others, Resembles mine, I, too, for them, can answer. The susceptible mind, alive to wrongs, Is equally alive to benefits. I am the proselyte of Ximenes, In admiration; let me add, in friendship! Thou, the most eloquent of advocates, That ever urged the faith of thy Messiah, Almost persuadest me to be a Christian. 2d Captive, to the First. My heart, my friend, repeats the strains of thine! 3d Captive. Mine vibrates in strict unison to both. When the fine passions, by some great occasion Excited, act with all their energy, They mock the weaker power of florid speeches. Ximenes. Sure, this example of my equity Hath most judiciously been shown. Good Zaigri, When thou hast freed from chains these souls of fire, Who never will, again, abuse their freedom, Hither return; something I would impart, That claims attention from your private ear. Adieu, my honest Moors; if you should hold, At any time, important intercourse With sects, from which your tenets are abhorrent; Remember, still, 'tis in the breast of man, In any faith, to be magnanimous. 1st Captive. Farewell, thou noble governour of Spain! If thy ambition prompts thee to convert The generous Moorish race, this is the way. White-robed benevolence, whose smile is love, That sky-descended cherub, ever melts To purer faith than inquisitions burn. [Exeunt, Zaigri, and the Captives. SCENE II. Ximenes, alone. Some office to discharge for a great empire, How sweetly does the task glide through the conscience, When policy, and lenity conspire! This happy union of the wise, and good, But seldom meets the anxious minister! Yet this fair union, in another object, Engages, now, my mind, with warmer interest. That object should I, happily, obtain, 'Twould gild the evening of my various day; And my last scene would be, the placid hours, Given by a vernal, and descending sun. But Zaigri (Heaven accept my wish!) returns. SCENE III. Re-enters, Zaigri. Zaigri. You hear the acclaim of gratitude, and joy. 'Tis hard to say, whether my countrymen Expressed more rapturous triumph, for the lives Continued to their friends; or for the soul Angelick, that so easily could pardon. Oh! Ximenes, the voice of honest praise, Though by the mind severe deemed empty air, Even in this world, rewards, almost, completely, All our unwearied toils for publick good, And all the great atchievements of the hero! Ximenes. Doubtless, that praise is balm, which kindly soothes The pains that ne'er are separate from greatness. Young, modest, blushing merit, feels it's power; And merit long inured to eulogy. 'Tis pleasing, but not satisfactory. 'Tis in thy power, at this momentous crisis, To give me true, substantial, lasting pleasure. Zaigri. Name but the means, and I will fly, to use them. Ximenes. Embrace the Christian faith;âbe not alarmed; The best effects will follow thy conversion; Which to obtain, 'tis my ingenuous wish, To win thy heart, and to convince thy reason. While, then, on topicks of eternal moment, I honestly advance, with patience hear me. Zaigri. With patience! rather, with attention ardent, I'll hear thy friendly, thy paternal strain: And that thou may'st pervade my inmost soul, The present subject of thy holy work, I will unfold to thee, my thoughts, my habits, Without the least reserve, or subterfuge. Thy novice is not stubborn; he admits One of the sacraments in Rome's religion: Why should I scruple to confess to thee! Ximenes. Already Zaigri is a Christian Moor! With pleasure I'll attend to thy recital: 'Twill give a fair foundation, a fair scope, For the great outlines of our beauteous fabrick. Zaigri. I have been taught to venerate our code: But since, with years, my sentiment, and reason, Grew to maturity, I own, that code Excited in my breast, repugnant doubts. Yet have I not despaired; nor have I feared: For there's a simpler law that keeps me easy; And while it's rules distinct my life obeys, I look to Heaven, with trust, and lively hope. Impelled by nature, and informed by reason, I felt, and knew, what habit hath confirmed. I scorn to be unjust; to fly, in battle; To let my senses lord it o'er my mind: I'm, to the proud, unbending; with the humble, I still descend to their humility. I keenly suffer for another's woe; If I have power, it hath my best relief; If I have none, I shed a tear that soothes it. This is the sum of my religious practice; And in a life of pains, and revolutions, It hath done wonders for me; poured a balm Into it's warriour's wounds; through a long march, Oppressive heat, tormenting thirst, abated; And, Ximenes, when, of my father's kingdom I hardly was deprived, even then it cheared me; And told me, that I had a kingdom left, The power, and art, over myself to reign, Of price far greater than all other empires! Ximenes. Ambition to accomplish noble objects Hath ever fired my life; that same ambition Protracts, inspirits, yet, my vital flame. Then grant me, for my last, and brightest glory, To earn a signal palm, in my profession; To make a convert of a soul like thine! A convert! rather, an accomplished Christian! For our religion new enforcement gains, New demonstration, from a Zaigri's manners. They show, that human nature, formed by virtue, Glides, of it's own accord, into the system; That by her precepts, formed however nobly, From that superior system it acquires Enlargement, spirit, blooming hope, too vivid, To suffer gloomy doubts, alarming fears.â Thy ruthless prophet taught thee to bestride The warlike steed; proudly to march to conquest; To plunge the sword into each honest breast That scorned obedience to a sensual despot; That scorned the prostitution of the soul. He taught thee to assassinate mankind; To desolate the world, and to enjoy The woes, the shrieks, of widows, and of orphans! Zaigri. Oh! Mahomet, thou hast deceived thy followers! Thou broughtest no commission from the skies! Ximenes. We boast a different leader; all his progress Diffused beneficence to human kind; Even to his rancorous foes, large acts of mercy. His laws are consentaneous with his life; They bid us quell all selfish, baleful passions; Destructive to their slave, and to the world. They bid us, not as Mahomet allures His weak disciples, basely overwhelm Our spark of heavenly flame with sensual pleasure; But, in right order, as endowed with reason, To subjugate the body to the mind. Hence, the true Christian, lord of appetite, The vanquisher of low, but fierce resentments, Which in a painful fever keep the soul; Free from impediments, persues, with ardour, All that adorns, and meliorates the man; That polishes our life, or soothes it's ills. Whene'er compassion, with her glistening eye, Points to the squalid cottage of affliction, Jews, Moors, and Infidels, are, all, his brethren. Could he, in some remote, and barbarous land, By powerful gold, or salutary arts, Make pale distress give way to blooming joy, He'd traverse wilds, or swelling seas, to court The god-like office; his expanded heart, In every climate, feels itself at home.â If I'm prolix, excuse the fault of age. Zaigri. Oh! I could listen, through a summer's day, To thy discourse; and while my soul it seizes, The prejudices, all, relax, and die, Which education formed, and habit strengthened. I have no enemies, or I forgive them: My love of man dilates; 'tis universal; It spreads, in warm diffusion, o'er the globe. Ximenes. The Christian, in creation's dread arrangement, Thus holds his proper sphere; maintains his course, With equable, with independent motion; Not from his orbit drawn, by wrong attractions; But steddy, and concentral with his God. If, next, we launch beyond the bounds of time, Anticipating our eternal state, How does your mean elysium pall, and fade, Contrasted with our Christian paradise! Need I insist, to Zaigri, that the joys Of sense, are not man's chief, and final good; The best reward bestowed by Heaven, on virtue? Need I to lose my time? should I insult thee? No:âin the deathless regions, we shall see, And know the Deity; we shall converse. With worthy men made perfect; intermix, Improve our knowledge, and felicity. When every generation hath elapsed, This palsied hand, strung with perpetual manhood, And smit with musick, shall express my rapture While heaven resounds with choral harmony. From age, to age, for ever, we shall range Through infinite creation; we shall pass, From system, on, to system; view their laws, With ease; with ease, discover all their beauty; And kindling, thus, to transport, we shall grow, From the pure pleasures of the saint, and sage, Enthusiasts, ruled by reason's god-like sway. Zaigri. Oh! by thy eloquence, I'm led, in fancy, To mansions worthy of seraphick spirits! I almost blush that I revered the Koran! Ximenes. Even now, with glowing tints I paint the hours, Crowned with heaven's amaranth, when thou, and I, Immortal friends, together, shall explore (With pious exultation) wisdom, beauty, Perfection, bliss;âthen, haply, from some orb, Where better suns exalt the purple year, Where God's own likeness, moral intellect, Works finer imagery, sublimer thought, We shall look down on Mecca, and Medina (Vast space pervading with an angel's ken) And while we recollect their wars, their err ours, Give them a smile benign of calm compassion; For, there, all tears, for ever, from all eyes, Are wiped away.âBelievest thou this faith? I know that thou believest. Zaigri. Ximenes Strongly hath spoken to my best affections, Best sentiments; and strongly to my reason. Give me some time to think. I need not tell thee, That when an honest man resolves to change His faith, his mind prepares to take a passage Of awful moment. I'll reflect maturely On all the noble pictures thou hast shown me; And every argument shall have it's weight. Whatever lively hopes, portentous fears, Which owe their birth to perishable objects, May move my ductile fancy, I'll prefer Important, and eternal truth to all things. Ximenes. I know thy conscience well; hence, I've not mentioned The great advantage to the realms of Spain That certainly would flow from thy conversion. Thousands of Moors would follow thy example. Nor have I urged the fortune of thy love;â That this conversion, to thy tender wishes Would surely win the beauteous Leonora. Zaigri, solicitous for sacred honour, Aside will never turn, to estimate Collateral, specious, but inferiour objects. I must repose awhile; pleased, that my life, Even to it's last remainder, is exerted, To urge the merits of a generous cause. Zaigri, farewell! may salutary truth Direct thee, and the great celestial Source, From whom that glorious emanation flows! Zaigri. Thou know'st my honesty, my resolution. Farewell, my friend, my father, and my guide! [Exit Ximenes. SCENE IV. Zaigri, alone. Thou light of Spain!âof a degenerate world! âThe great objection to my acquiescence In what the cardinal so warmly wishes, Is, that it might be thought, I changed my faith, From views unworthy of me; to propitiate My love; or by a signal obligation, For ever to secure the regent's favour. For when I exercised impartial reason, I own, oh! Mahomet, from thy religion, That I've been, often, half a renegado! Thy fragrant, gay, luxuriant paradise, With all it's glowing charms, it's poignant joys, To thought unprejudiced, but ill repays Good, reasoning, suffering, and immortal minds. To souls, whose current flows on great persuits, Even while they're vested with terrestrial bodies, Their view of thy anticipated pleasures; The goblet crowned with roses; nay, the fair-one, With youth perpetual, with divine attractions, Meets the fastidious senses. Other objects Delight these souls; and surely must await them, In future life;âa fine, resplendent chain Of pure ideas, beauteous images, Dependent from high Heaven, to humble earth; Raising the raptured soul, connecting man, Mortal, but yet eternal, with his God! SCENE V. I inserted this scene, because, without it, I thought that Zaigri would have been too long, at one time, on the stage. Alonzo, and Audley. Alonzo. Ingenuous Briton! did I not assure thee, That, of all statesmen, he was best prepared, Alike by nature, and his habitudes, To render parts, and learning, all their honours? Audley. I was delighted with our interview! He's not indebted to his splendid fame! Oh! Ximenes! already I admire thee! His converse proved him an accomplished sage; Graced with politeness;âwith respect, and ease. His manner grand, yet free from arrogance, Is like the style of the great Roman consul; Tyros, by elegant simplicity Deceived, imagine they can write such language; Yet who can rival it's magnificence? Alonzo. Believe me, I enjoy your satisfaction; I hope, your mind, extremely delicate, And conscious of the dignity of man, Will never feel regret, that you have changed Your English native soil for Spanish ground. Audley. I should apologize to Ximenes; To you, Sir, for my misapplied suspicion, And roughness, when I first accosted you. But I, unfortunately, have a mind Susceptible, and I've conflicted, long, With beings of our species, who had none; With envy, malice, insolence in power. Then, you'll excuse the spring of sentiment, Acting with gentle elasticity, If rightly treated; but, with violence, Rebounding from hard pressure. Alonzo. Why excuse it, When no excuse it needs? You've acted nobly, As Heaven ordained your action! In our groves, Breathing the sweets of Araby the blest, Atonement will be made you for the storms You hitherto have suffered. Ximenes Enlightens us with knowledge, and presents Himself, to all our eyes, a glorious model Of true philanthropy. Audley. And one great man Will more improve a state, than a long series Of politicians, born with common minds. Alonzo. This truth our governour exemplifies: You mentioned your hard fortune. Pray, what boots it, That the renowned inhabitants of England, With liberal arts are more refined than we, Unless the warmer virtues of the heart, Still, to the cultivation of the mind, Run parallel, along?âI've read man's nature; I doubt not but, sometimes, your haughty peers, Perhaps, more frequently, your haughtier prelates, The gross misrepresentatives of him, Whose humble soul could hardly frown on vice, Wage, with fine talents, a perpetual war; Exact, with rigour, from their hapless owner, The cold, and even march of prosperous dullness; Watch, to oppress him with their awkward power; Dare to revenge, on him, the Almighty's will, For sickening their dark souls with it's own brightness; And, thus, on earth, rebell against the skies. Audley. I see, you're conversant with human kind; Hence, how their passions operate in England, You know as well as if you had resided, For many years, in our famed capital. Alonzo. By observation, we may clearly trace Our selfish nature, through it's varied mazes; Foretell it's conduct, even in situations, Fertile of new, and complicated trial. Minds of blunt intellect, by fortune's caprice, Held up to publick view, must ever hate Superiour spirit, and superiour knowledge.â âBut come with me;âwe'll treat you properly; I, with a kind respect;â'tis my ambition, To imitate the cardinal of Spain! [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Enter Zaigri, and Leonora. Zaigri. Nay, Leonora; much I sympathize With all thy tender, feminine alarms. But thou, whose mental powers are far exalted Above the common order of thy sex, Should'st bid them arm thy soul with resolution, To meet the rude encounters of misfortune. I'm not insensible to all the dangers Impending o'er our love; but I subdue Their terrours with internal discipline. For though I can be firm, I am not torpid; I should not merit half of the eulogy Which hath been given me by too generous fame; Had I not fortitude to keep my mind In proper tone for it's important duties; But, above all, to cheer thy languid heart; To animate the drooping soul of thee, To whom the warriour owes his brigthest glory; Who hast repayed his toils with virtuous love; Whose delicate, and noble mind, commanding Alliance with the first grandee of Spain, Spurning those prejudices that enchain The timid, vulgar soul; spurning those dangers That might appall undaunted resolution, Hath given it's preference to a captive Moor. But though I can exclude the persecution Of thoughts tormenting; if I could not feel, And exquisitely, too, my stupid nature Would not deserve the love of Leonora. Leonora. Then thou wilt sympathize more tenderly With those anxieties, with those alarms, Those agonies, that harrass my existence. My waking hours are passed in fears, and sorrows; My sleep, till now, congenial with my life, Downy, and calm, the merited repose Of innocence, and virtue, is assailed, And wrought to tumult, and distress, with dreams, Of horrid omen. O'er our narrow sea, Methought, last night, that I was borne with Zaigri, Eluding the persuit of Spanish foes. At night we reached your Africk: in a mosque, Magnificent as day with crescent lustres, Our nuptial vows were plighted: as we left The mosque, and near its door, the duke my father, Met us, attended by Castilian friends:â In his right hand, a daggerâwhich he plunged Into my breast, with these emphatick words:â âA Spaniard ought to have the Roman in him:â âMy daughter shall not long survive her shame; âI sacrifice her life to her past honour.â Oh! kind interpreter! read me this vision! I see it yet; I see my father's poniard! On whom can my distress recline, but Zaigri; Thou authour, thou reliever of my woes! Zaigri. Thy agony my soul convulses!âhear me! And, if thou canst, with some composure. Thoughts Alarming in the day, when we should rest, Raise spectres, unconnected with all fact. To thy chimÃ¦ra I'll oppose a truth; And give it it's desert, thy fixed attention. Sure, at this crisis, by indulgent Heaven, 'Twas sent us, for our mutual consolation, And permanence in virtue. But three nights Ago, I walked along the Oro's banks, To give my mind its free, reflecting range. The stream was chrystalline; the sky was azure; The grove refrained from motion:âawful silence Was jealous of his reign; for not a breath Of aromatick air presumed to whisper. The moon, decked in her most refulgent silver, Shot her soft lustre through the verdant foliage, And raised the soul to intercourse celestial. I felt myself prepared for higher converse Than our poor earth affords.âSudden, before me Stood old Abdallah's venerable form, My sage, and valiant father.âTo a statue Amazement petrified me:âfrom his aspect A smile paternal beamed:âthese words he spoke, With all the dignity that graced his life. âMy son, though trained to ills, should some hard trial âOppose thy virtue still; let the same spirit âReceive it, which at Munda's well-fought battle, âSuperiour rose to sickness, and an army, âWhen Zaigri interposed his conquering sword, âTo save his father.âKeep thy resolution, âNe'er to desert thy persecuted virtue; âThe sequel leave to Heaven; commit thy cause âTo perfect wisdom, and benevolence.â His admonition ended, he retired, With active pace, into the thickest wood: I followed, and I sought him; but in vain. Leonora. The sacred scene speaks hope to Leonora. Zaigri. And so it spoke to me.âAt first, a flood Of filial tears I offered to thy shade, Renowned Abdallah!âSalutary tears, That left behind them, purest peace of mind; A virtuous joy; a gentle ecstacy:â Communication with a better world. Leonora. Yes, I revive, reform; the wayward Christian Learns true religion from her infidel. I will endeavour, as I ought, like thee, Securely to confide in Providence. I will adopt thy spirit; it will bear me Through the worst evils that can yet befall The dubious fortune of our constant love. Zaigri. A due exertion of my fair-one's mind, Good, and exalted, always will prepare thee For the most rigorous lot of human life. And why should virtue tremble at it's frowns, It's changes, and it's chances? Few our wants! I trust, though spoiled of realms, of courtly favour, The orient sun will cheer my morning hours; And to my vespers Philomel will pour Her sweet, according, and inspiring note. Earth will refresh me with her fruits; her flowers Will greet my senses; her pellucid streams Will quench my thirst; her hospitable bowers Will shade me; while yon vast, and azure concave Spreads forth, for man, the canopy of heaven. Grant me these objects, with my Leonora, And this immortal spirit rectified; From these true gifts of God, these genuine blessings, To draw their moral colour, form, and pleasures, And I shall, then, be happy; I shall deem The pageantry, and bustle of the world, The sport of children, and of fools, the contest. Leonora. Say, who can listen, and not catch thy flame? Sincerely, then, thy Leonora tells thee, That with these simple objects, yet, the sources Of the most poignant pleasures, and with Zaigri, This world, so fertile of calamity, Would prove, to me, a paradise: my thanks I'd pay to Heaven, for all my cares, and pains; Those salutary monitors, which cure The giddy mind, in elevated station; Strengthen, refine it, to determined virtue; Detach us from dependence on mankind; Contract the space, and, hence, ensure the stay Of our felicity. On this retirement Should any ill intrude; thy consolation, And thy society, with present pleasure Would ballance pain, and soon extract the sting. And if my love could mitigate thy cares, The sense that I possessed that healing power Would soothe my grief for thee, and in it's place Would substitute a pleasing melancholy. âBut Zaigri, we forget, that, when we meet, We tread on dangerous ground; foes all around, Watch us, with eyes, and ears; let us retire Separate; farewell! may the good angels guard thee! Zaigri, embracing her. Saints, prophets, Allah's powerful arm protect thee! Plan for me, soon, another interview! Adieu! He who possesses thy affection, [Exit Leonora. And yet complains of his adversity, Too superciliously exacts from fortune! [Exit Zaigri. SCENE VII. Ximenes, and Alonzo. Ximenes. Well; have you seen the worthy Garcilasso? Much have I longed to hear again, Alonzo, How Spain demeans herself in our new world. Alonzo. My Lord, in justice, first, to Garcilasso, I am the messenger of his regret, That illness, an effect of his long voyage, On age oppressive, hath prevented him From offering you, in person, his respects, With all the early zeal of good allegiance, And a full history of the modern Indies: I grieve, my Lord, to bring you it's idea. Ximenes. What! does the cross, emblem of heavenly mercy, Still march through blood? Alonzo. Their conduct is not milder: Nay, it would seem, our soldiers, and their leaders, By habit, grow more savage: well you know The sad catastrophe of Montezuma; The bloody laurels of the ruffian Cortez; Soon you will learn the more inhuman fate Of Atabalipa; indignant, learn The more destructive carnage of Pizarro, In fraud, and in barbarity, unrivalled. To copy monstrous deeds, from their superiours, Why need I add the aptness of the rabble; Who torture, for their sport, the harmless Indians! Ximenes. Surely thou must remember, my Alonzo, The annals, and the fate of brave Columbus; And he was equally humane, and brave. From Spanish cruelty, beyond the Atlantick, And from his ill-requited services (For Ferdinand was selfish, and capricious) Severely he repented his discovery; Of courts deceitful; of ungrateful man, Took his last leave; and at Valladolid, He pined, and sunk, to an untimely grave! Surely the good man grieved, that he had opened An avenue to rapine, and to murder. As much I suffer, to have patronized His great adventure. Vain, unhappy mortals! Blind to the future; yet, for ever, eager, When fancy plumes a specious enterprize, With all her orient, but delusive colours! How ardent was Columbus, and myself, To find another hemisphere! If thus The best ambition is on earth rewarded, The worst must feel unutterable pain! Alonzo. Ill suits it me, to hint to Ximenes A particle of wisdom; but, my Lord, The consequences of a noble conduct Are not in the performer's power; yet, surely, The motives are his own; and to himself, They fail not to condemn, or praise him. Ximenes. True; But when I think on the calamities Which I have partly caused to the poor Indians, Who, even their foes acknowledge, are innoxious, Calamities, for which, the warrant vouched, Is our religion; the corrosive thought Is second poison to my tottering age; It tears my nerves; and presses down my heart! âYe rapid heroes! ye unwearied statesmen! Ardent, and strenuous, to extend your empire, And multiply your subjects! what results Ensue? You, only, to a painful stretch, Extend your mind, and multiply your cares! But I lose time, with unavailing sorrow. We'll go immediately to Garcilasso, And plan some remedy to these distresses. When publick misery calls on Ximenes; To my last breath, I will forget my own. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A splendid Royal Apartment. Ximenes, alone. The pressure of old age; my mind's exertions; My many anxious cares for publick weal; For private glory; and the subtle foe, The minister of dark assassination, To the dread confines of the world eternal At length, have brought me: in the closing act Of my life's drama, let my deeds be worthy Of it's most animated scenes. Intent On contemplation, my expiring lamp Hath often caught my eye; it vibrated With active motion, and shot beauteous rays Of rich, and varied light. What nature's laws Give to the dying lamp, let me derive From the full force of that great moral law, Which ever forms, and guards, and perfects virtue; Strong, and unconquerable resolution. SCENE II. Enters Alonzo. Alonzo. My lord, the duke of Alva, with the marquis Of Aguilar, and of Astorga, mindful, With due observance, of the hour you fixed, Are here, and wait your leisure. Ximenes. Are my heralds Without, in proper order, to accost them? Alonzo. They are, my lord. Ximenes. Then you may bid them enter: I hope I shall dismiss them better taught, And humbler than they came. SCENE III. Ximenes mounts his Throne; the three Grandees enter, introduced by Alonzo; they seem surprized at Ximenes's situation; bow to him humbly, and in confusion. Alonzo continues on the Stage. Ximenes. My lords, you wished An interview on matter of great import; Communicate your business freely to me. Marquis of Aguilar. 'Tis for the ear of Ximenes alone. Ximenes. Marquis of Aguilar, I'd rather trust Alonzo, than the first grandee of Spain; I've trusted him with more momentous secrets Than any you can bring me:âstay Alonzo; You shall not go:ânow, gentlemen, proceed. Duke of Alva. My lord, ere you usurped a power in Spain, Never by subject exercised before; 'Tis known to you, to Europe, to the world, That her grandees were venerated, feared; The counsellours, the guardians of their king; Their privileges none presumed to question. Then we desire to know, by what commission, By what severe authority, our rights, From immemorial time, are spurned by you; How a Franciscan, from his humble cell, Controuls our nobles, as his caprice dictates; By what mysterious title he condemns them To servile chains; to banishment, or death. Ximenes. They who are void of true, inherent greatness, Still spread the glare of artificial plumage. Sure, a good monk is a far nobler being Than he who, impudently, pleads his wealth, His titles, and his virtuous ancestry, To warrant rapine, murder, and rebellion. Marquis of Astorga. My lord, none of these crimes you will imputeâ Ximenes. Astorga, if again you interrupt me, I'll treat you as a traitor to your prince; In me, respect his representative. For the last time, I'll deign to reason with you; With words to make you feel your misdemeanours, And learn your duty; therefore, mark me well. Through the timidity, and indolence Of kings, and ministers, for centuries, Your fathers trampled on all law, and order; Oppressed the poor, and with your rightful sovereigns Waged a licentious war; till I arose, And broke the horrours of the gothick spell; Restored the vigour of the written law; And forced even arrogance like yours, to own The law eternal, on the human heart Impressed, of justice, and humanity. Your monarch hath to me his sway deputed; And, in his absence, I am king of Spain; Aye, and on good occasions, I'll exert Each atom of my delegated power. Heaven is my witness, I detest all tyrants: You are a band of tyrants; a poor state Had better crouch to Nero than to you! A single monster might be sooner reached, Sooner exterminated:âyou're a hydra; [He descends from the Throne. And I'm a Hercules;ânot yet worne out; And if you still make havock in our Lerna, Like old Alcides, while I live, I'm able To cut off heads, never to spring again. So much for words; of my authority We'll give them now a proof more palpable. Duke of Alva. You say, my lord, that you love clemency; We meant not to offend our noble regent; But with humility to plead our cause. Ximenes. Be not afraid; I will not, but for justice Material to the state, even hurt a hair On any of your heads; for in Heaven's book, They all are numbered. 'Tis now, yours, Alonzo, To see that on the terrace, and the platform, My faithful servants execute my orders. [Exit Alonzo. Listen, my lords, a moment;â [Cannons fire. Now you hear Those iron tongues;âdo they not speak distinctly? âHear them again!âwith voice emphatical, They tell the rude insurgents of these realms, By what authority I do these things; How the Franciscan cord, with it's least motion, Can lead our proud grandees, and make them tremble; While Ximenes, with these tremendous warrants, Controuls all Arragon, and both Castiles. Now duke of Alva, Aguilar, Astorga, I'll never more with you expostulate. Farewell, for this time; if you give me cause Again to punish your disloyalty, I'll speak to you, in thunder; I'll urge home The last decisive argument of kings. [Exit Ximenes: manent, Alva, Aguilar, Astorga. Alva. We now may go; I'm glad that our dismission Was not still more severe:âmy lords, I told you, That to interrogate a Ximenes On governing with rigour, was to ask The glorious sun why he sent down on Spain Rays so direct, and ardent. Aguilar. I must own, Your simile is apt, in various lights, So splendid, so magnificent, his manner. Astorga. Me he hath made a convert to obedience; Again I feel him like the orb of day; Though his heat withers me, yet I admire him; The powerful conquerour charms, while he subdues! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Ximenes, and Alonzo. Ximenes. Alonzo, go to Audley, and Randolfo, The Florentine, and Briton, and acquaint them, That, for awhile, I wish to have their converse. Alonzo. With expedition I'll obey the order. [Exit. Alonzo. Ximenes, alone. No task more grateful to a generous mind Than to suppress, and mortify the pride That flows not from a consciousness of merit, But from a sense of accidental power O'er others, and an ardour to pervert it To our own use; our mean, and selfish nature Is not deformed with a worse lineament. To hold a proper language to those rebels, My poor remains of strength almost exhausted. I feel that my good acts must now be crouded: Time presses; and my tide of life is ebbing Extremely fast; then, let it, like the Nile, Leave fruitful tracts behind it. [Alonzo introduces Audley, and Randolfo, and retires. SCENE V. Ximenes. Gentlemen, Well met; an intercourse with men of learning Alleviates publick labours:âAudley, you'll find The clime of Spain oppressive, after England. Audley. At first, my lord;âhabit will make it easy. Our nature's flexible; we grow indifferent, Soon, to all latitudes, if we're inured To temperance, and to good, and close persuits. Ximenes. A certain, and a most momentous truth! To you, Randolfo, our intenser climate Is less perceptible; a genial heat Warms your fair soil, and animates her sons. Randolfo. 'Tis true, my lord; but I should be ambitious, To emulate my worthy British friend; And make all climates subject to the mind. The human mind, well-disciplined, imparts Most salutary beams to it's possessour; Or, in high station, rivalling the sun, Cheers a large empire with it's rays benign. The latter truth a Ximenes demonstrates: While he protects these realms, the arts, and virtue, From every country, are at home, in Spain. Ximenes. Give me thy hand; I like ingenuous praise;â 'Tis not a mark, I hope, that I'm a dotard. And to reply with eulogy sincere, I think you both have honoured me extremely, In quitting your own countries, where, by culture, The powers of intellect, and sentiment, Expand, with all their force, to all their action, For our comparatively barbarous land. Randolfo, I'm no stranger to the fame Of your great Medicis; no stranger, Audley, To the renown of Albion; much I've heard; Much have I read, of your immortal Alfred. The recollection of those famous annals, Warming my heart, will make me garrulous. Audley. Praise to our island, given by Ximenes, Must be harmonious to an English ear. Ximenes. By no great state it ever was excelled, In wisdom, or in valour:âI review, With martial heat, your Cressy, and Poitiers, And Azincour; where, at the sweeping storm Of true old English ardour, your French foes, In hosts innumerable, turned as pale As were their faded lilies.âLike old Nestor, I now must praise myself.âFor fifty years, I've been asserting man's eternal rights, In this licentious, or despotick land. Then, for my favourite chapter, in your annals, Give me your memorable victory, Of matchless import; without bloodshed gained; Give me your barons armed in the field, Not by Bellona, but by sage Minerva, With calm, yet with determined breast, extorting Your glorious charter from encroaching kings! The scene, the subject, warms the patriot band; And, by degrees, fair freedom's fine contagion Runs through the ranks: quick grows the pulse of nature; A lambent fire plays from each kindling eye;â While old, adjacent, and prophetick Thames, Sedge-crowned, with his congratulating labour, Heaves, from his deepest cave, an urn enormous; Pours it's libation, with a giant-glee, A pure, vast flood, to future liberty! Already the triumphant God foresees The certain homage of each distant clime. The older Brutus, and the younger Cato, Incline, attentive, from the sky; more happy To see their British peers!âMy friends, your pardon; My strain, I fear, grows lavish, grows Ovidian; But twice, in life, our nature is the boy. Audley. Yet, with such puerile thoughts, a Livy wrote; TyrtÃ¦us sung; the Fabii lived, and died. Ximenes. Island of glory! I am loth to quit thee! Nurse of brave sons, and daughters heavenly-fair! In late posterity, thou yet art destined To usher pictures to the sage's eye, In conflicts for thy freedom, unexampled In the world's various, and eventful page. But there's a common fate, my worthy Briton, [Taking Audley by the hand. Which all great states have suffered;âluxury, Sprung from rich commerce, is at war with virtue. The time may come, when your illustrious country, Shall lose her worth, and fame; when you, deluded, Wondering at vanished Sparta, shall behold The glittering, trivial race of soft Tarentum: When, with the mouldering form, the empty shell Of liberty, it's vital pith all gone, You shall be mocked, and cheated; in your senate, Gay, venal striplings, will presume to plead, With warmth, and plausibility, for freedom; And prate about her, when she lives no more.â âBut let me change this melancholy prospect. 'Twas my intention, when I next should meet you, To ask of each, a favour of importance. 'Tis promised by some other learned strangers: Sure, what they granted, you will not refuse me. Randolfo. I promise for myself;âI may, for Audley. Audley. You may, assuredly; what Ximenes Desires, by me can never be refused. Ximenes. 'Tis, that if you survive me, you continue, For life, with your appointments, to inform Our Spanish youth, in liberal arts, and science; The best preservatives from every vice, Next to religion; and the best incentives To every virtue: for a legacy, 'Tis, therefore, one of my anxieties, To leave these moral treasures to my country. Audley. To realize thy wish, I will devote My ardent zeal, and my industrious care, As I revere the Majesty supreme! What genius ought not to be proud to second The plans, the talents of so great a master! Randolfo. I, too, invoke the providence of Heaven, So to befriend me, as I shall apply My zeal, and my endeavours to fulfill What Ximenes requests! Ximenes. Accept, my friends, My ardent thanks; you greatly have obliged me. One favour you've conferred; let me unfold Two, of a different nature, done to me. âThree years ago, the moment when I opened A letter of express from Germany, I felt it fraught with virulent contents: A subtle, potent, and a fatal vapour, Flew to my brain, and, for awhile, dislodged My reason; often, since, my head is seized With racking pains, and temporary stupor.â This to the Austrian cabinet I owe! Audley. Oh! ill-requited cares for Austria's empire! Ximenes. Nought but the death of merit satiates envy! Twelve times the moon hath changed, since, on my journey To the salubrious climate of Aranda, I dined at Boseguillas; my repast Was hardly ended, when the dire effects Of deadly poison tore this aged frame:â I'm told it came from one I thought my friend: If it be so, tortures exceeding mine, Will, ere he dies, requite the barbarous deed. Randolfo. Whoe'er he be, he's not the enemy Of Ximenes alone, but of mankind; And may his brother-dÃ¦mons rack the fiend! Ximenes. Let us forgive our enemies; believe me (Is there aught, now, to tempt me to deceive?) I long have conquered permanent revenge: You know, our master for his murderers prayed. âI've seen, I've known, I've felt this changeful world; It's many cares; it's toils; it's disappointments; It's perfidy; it's black ingratitude: Nought has it worth a wish, excepting virtue; And that, for justice, must appeal above. Full fourscore years, and more, have snowed this head; The mind's exertion, age, assassination, Have shaken this frail body, to it's vitals: Therefore, this world, which I've too truly painted, I leave, without regret; I leave, with pleasure. Audley. For me, to wish, to live like Ximenes, Would argue too presumptuous an ambition; But let me wish, like Ximenes to die! Randolfo. So pray I, for myself, with fervent spirit! Ximenes. Too warm is your esteem; the eye of friendship Still proves, to worth, a magnifying mirrour! You'll both retire with me; for I must show you Some sacred volumes of much erudition; From which, in after times, and in the sphere Celestial, I foresee my brightest fame. Be it your care, to give them to the world. A reverence to each Holy Testament Should surely dictate, and distinguish mine. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. Giraldo, alone. I have the strongest proofs that Baracaldo Poisoned our regent;ânay, of late, the villain Has looked the murderer; looked, as if he wished To stab each man that met him, and himself. In the same chamber, a few nights ago, Is was my chance, to sleep with Baracaldo; His perturbation, in his dreams, awaked me. Look! Ximenes is there! (he cried) how pale, How wan, and how emaciated! His eyes Are sunk; yet baleful are their glances, to me! Take him away, my friends! oh! take him off! I cannot bear the agonizing sight! He crushes, racks, annihilates me! He started, and awoke.âInfernal monster! A creature, whom the generous cardinal Took from a low estate; promoted, placed him, In honourable office, near his person. Ingratitude is a characteristick Of man alone; a most ignoble stigma On the first beings of this nether world! Am I a dog?âexclaimed the proud Philistine! A dog is always grateful.âLet me think:â Our cautious laws ask more than moral proofs; Mine are not legal; but I will supply The phlegmatick, and timorous law's defect; Snatch a bold grace, in conduct; and despising Local, and uneffective institution, Assert pure, absolute, eternal justice. This poniard shall reprove the traitor's heart! Mine will approve the deed!âAnd if the heart, It's hurry o'er, in movement calm, approves An act that supersedes the voice of nature, The offender whom we killed, deserved to die. My love of glory, too, with all it's fire, Impells me to avenge a Ximenes. Spain, Europe, and the new-discovered world Will rank me with their patriots, and their heroes! âBut while I meditate this great atchievement, I see the Cardinal himself approaching! [He sheaths the dagger:âenters Ximenes. SCENE VII. I wrote this scene, only to prepare the reader, or spectator, for the warm interest which the cardinal afterwards feels in the fate of Giraldo. By this scene, I think Ximenes is brought too soon on the stage, after his last departure from it; and it would have been more properly omitted, if the piece had been represented. Ximenes. How fares Giraldo?âI would speak with you. Giraldo. My Lord, I'm ever proud of conversation With you. Ximenes. My life flows fast; my time is short; Thou wilt not, now, refuse what I shall ask? Giraldo. Let Ximenes command; and I'll obey. Ximenes. Give me thy solemn word that thou wilt be, To thy life's end, what thou hast always been, Brave, honest, generous, temperate in thy pleasures. Giraldo. As Heaven omniscient hears our conference, I'll be, to death, what thou requirest of me. Ximenes. Then I am satisfied, concerning thee.â This is my oral will; and thou wilt find Giraldo's name distinguished in another. Farewell, my friend; be Providence thy guide: Continue virtuous; and continue happy. Giraldo. My Lord, farewell. [Exit Ximenes.]âThou demigod on earth! Thy kindness points my sword, and fires my arm! [Exit Giraldo. SCENE VIII. Leonora, and Lucinda. Leonora. The gloom, Lucinda, darkens more around me: Thy consolation, and thy sympathy, Are losing, now, their charming power to soothe me. Lucinda. What new distress, big with uncommon evil, Alarms a heart, too tremblingly alive? Leonora. But now, that wretch, our grand inquisitor, Whose first delight, is, to torment mankind, Hath left my father; from those prejudices Of nation, and religion, which contract The minds of both; but chiefly, from the stern, And unrelenting soul of Torquemada, I must infer the worst calamity. And should that fiend, with all his life consistent, Pleading Heaven's warrant, perpetrate some deed, Destructive of my peace, and of my love, The prospect of redress from Ximenes, Is, by a strange fatality, precluded. That god-like man, who seems to have been born To punish tyrants, to protect the helpless, And from the tortured breast to root out pain, Has, with absurd, with cruel toleration, Which, to it's cause, acuteness ne'er could trace, Indulged the frantick zeal of Torquemada, In barbarous deeds licentious: then, what hope, What faintest gleam of hope can rise to me? Lucinda. My Leonora, with advice elaborate To pall thy sick, and agitated mind, Would be imprudent; yet let me intreat thee To summon to thy aid the powerful comforts Which innocence affords afflicted minds; And every Christian's task, with fortitude To bear the evils of this transient life. Leonora. Not yet these awful, salutary objects Are torne from my distracted memory. But oh! thou Father of the universe! [She kneels. Omniscient Authour of the human frame! By whom strong hopes, and fears; love, and abhorrence, Are there infused; the private agonies For self; the generous pains for others! If a weak woman hath not force of soul To rule the feelings of humanity; To check the impulse of a noble passion; Wilt thou forgive me! Thou, who must distinguish Frailty from will perverse! I trust, thou wilt; Or I shall now incurr divine displeasure! [She rises. Lucinda. I'd sooner die than offer thee vain hope, The source of future, and severer grief. But 'tis the genius of imagination, With it's precursive, and unbounded action, To magnify all human good, and ill. Check the wild ranger with the curb of reason; Use, for thyself, that heaven-descended talent, Which to another's fate thou would'st apply With powerful energy. Besides, thy father, And Torquemada, might confer on business Not relative to Zaigri, nor to thee. Leonora. This boding heart, Lucinda, is pressed down With a presentiment, which rudely foils Thy sympathetick aid.âMy noble Zaigri, Had thy great soul been reared in mean estate; Had I been born in similar condition; And had not partial, and tyrannick laws, From simple truth repelled our ancestors, We had been happy! My plain, honest father, Untainted with the art, and pomp of life, Would have acceded, with more ease, to reason, And owned the universal ties of nature! Our humble cottage would have, then, escaped The watchful bigot's dark, and tearless eye! That faithful cot would have done all it promised; It would have kindly sheltered peace, and love! Oh! why, Lucinda, does the gorgeous palace Mock, and insult us with it's proffered pleasures? Lucinda. Would that thy pleasing, and instructive pictures Owed less their style pathetick to thy sorrows! Leonora. Those sorrows grow more pungent by reflexion! How shall I combat our impending danger! Shall I implore my father?âCould I soften His prejudice, and pride, this feeble hand Might, next, remove an Atlas. Shall I kneel, A suppliant, at the feet of Ximenes? As little, even from him, the great, the good, Can I anticipate our preservation! He, now, for years, from some mysterious cause, Or, from supine indulgence, inconsistent With all his other active, generous life, Hath borne inquisitorial tyranny. When the relentless flood sweeps us to ruin, The slightest shoot of an impending osier Instinctively we seize.âShall I, ignobly, Persuade my gallant Moor to change his faith? But, then, no longer should I find him Zaigri! How could I love him, with his glory faded! 'Tis less afflicting to a generous breast, To have the body in perpetual durance, Than to enslave the soul!âWhat horrid scenes Do I anticipate! I see thee, Zaigri, Seized by the ministers of Torquemada! Immured, for life, in a dark, noisome dungeon, Where courage as determined as thy own, Must be appalled, and sink! I see thee pining, And from the loss of glorious light, and freedom, Suffering a slow, and heart-consuming death! I see thee, yet more dreadfully, the victim Of horrid superstition, and revenge. Imagination puts me on the rack Inquisitorial!âHow it wrings my heart, And almost fires my brain!âThat horrid stake For him is not intended;ânor that fire; Not for pure honour; for humanity! Which ne'er approached distress, but to relieve it; And when it saw my grief, just as the sun Beams from a watery cloud, with cheering smile, Reproved the tear of it's own sympathy! How shall I calm my mind!âI fear, my reason Will suffer, in this wreck of happiness! Lucinda. May Heaven thy lost tranquillity restore, Which friendship strives, in vain, to re-establish! Leonora. Go with me to the arbour, there support me; Help me to meet, or to escape these ills! âWhat shall I do, my friend, to be at peace! Advise me, good Lucinda!âShall I quit This bustling, noisy, miserable world! Seek a still convent; kiss the holy veil! âOh! ignominious thought!âWhat, steal to quiet, While racks, or faggots, are prepared for Zaigri! âI must atone, by some heroÃ¯ck deed, If coward nature but obeys my zeal, For this high treason to deserted love! âI'll tell thee what I'll do.âYesâshould my lover Be sentenced to an agonizing death, I'll follow him to the last point of fate. I will attend the heinous execution; And seize the virtue of an Eastern dame. When the dire apparatus is compleated; The last criterion of his dauntless mind; I, too, like him, will have my pyle funereal, Which I'll ascend, with Indian majesty:â They who refuse the pains their lovers feel, Are strangers to the omnipotence of passion! I, once, will emulate a Zaigri's courage, And, once, the rigour of a Torquemada! I'll prove my constancy, as genuine gold Is proved, and die, my own inquisitor! [Exeunt. End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Inquisition: at a short distance from Granada. Zaigri, in prison. This change, I must confess, was unexpected. I knew the fluctuating scenes of life: But when I last saluted mild Aurora, I could not apprehend, that ere the moon Rose o'er the earth, a dungeon would receive me. I thought, the friendship of the noble regent A shield impassive to the violence Of this precipitate inquisitor. The wretch presumes to force a generous mind. I was, but lately, more than half a Christian; I now relapse into a Mussulman. I'd rather seem a profligate, a fool, Than play the servile hypocrite. By Allah, If aught could make me hate to do what's right, 'Twould be compulsion, urging rectitude. âWhere am I lodged?âThis is a charnel-house, There's something in it's dreadful style, it's manner, Strongly significant of pain, and death! Here silence, with distinct, and strong expression, Speaks, in funereal eloquence, and tells me, Pity, ne'er, hither brought her smile, or tear. New ghosts, incumbent on the murky air, Hover, and linger here, to execrate Their murderers, ingenious to refine On torture. To some distance from Granada, I'm now removed. The regent is infirm; Unable his imprisoned friend to rescue From the keen fangs of rapid persecution! All this, the brave must own, is terrible. But, surely, 'tis ambition's glorious aim, Greatly, to strive to be a perfect hero. This is the time, to summon to my aid, Of good, and great, whatever nature gave me; All that Abdallah taught; all that I owe To thought, to fortitude, to constant virtue! Some hand unlocks that gate!âMy eyes deceive me, Or Leonora is advancing hither. 'Tis she! the ingenuity of love Will glide through adamant!â[Enters Leonora] My Leonora! SCENE II. Let me, once more, enfold thee in these arms! Thy visit to me, here, pains, yet transports me! For in the worst calamity, the sight Of those we love, revives the drooping soul! We cling to them, with hope, and fondly fancy, That there's some mighty magick in affection, Which can elude the grasp of tyrant power! But how hast thou obtained admittance hither? Leonora. By all-persuasive gold;âbut in the state, Or rather, tumult of my present being, What rude obstruction could have checked my progress? For I'm resolved to live, or die with Zaigri! Oh! thy impending fate distracts my brain! Do I transgress our feminine reserve? Yet I feel no reproach, no sting, from conscience: Why should I blush to be in love with virtue? Zaigri. Were I not, now, desirous to allay My strong, and pungent feelings, I should yield Or to despondency, or wilder passion. Act thou like Leonora; let those truths, That still have modelled, still adorned thy life, Resume their influence, and ensure thy welfare Against the whirls of fortune. Leonora. Gracious Heaven! And canst thou reason; canst thou be composed? For me, I'm horrour, all; I'm, all, confusion; Zaigri, I am resolved not to survive thee. I've brought a faithful servant to this dungeon, [She shows a dagger. On whom I can rely:âif thou must suffer, This shall let out my soul!â'Twill follow thee; 'Twill flee away from pain, and be at rest! Zaigri. My resolution cannot stand this proof. When thy o'erwhelming violence of grief With horrour strikes my sight, pervades my fancy, Of manly action all my practice fails; And all it's theory dissolves in air. Why wilt thou make a coward of thy Zaigri? The taunts, and insults, of the human vulgar, I could with patience bear: I would not suffer, Even Penury's chill gripe to freeze my soul. Perhaps, on the fell rack, or at the stake, I might prove emulous of some great minds; And like a hero, tolerate my pain. But to know thee, who should'st repose, for ever, On conscious innocence, and deeds benign, A victim to excruciating woe, Would give the sharpest instruments of death, Points of invenomed fire; hurl, from her summit, Proud reason down; with desolating fury, Convulse the fixed foundations of existence; And wrenching nature from her last recesses, Would drive her round in frenzy! Wilt thou treat me With more barbarity than Torquemada! Leonora. Oh! I did wrong, to aggravate the weight Of thy calamity!âBut I'll be calm.â Zaigri. Then wilt thou grant one boon that I shall ask? Leonora. Whatever Zaigri shall request, I'll grant. Zaigri. Give me that dagger, gentle Leonora; It suits but ill thy tender, female arm. Leonora. Take it, from my regard for truth, and thee; But be assured, I give it with reluctance: For shouldst thou, cruelly, be wrested from me, It would have proved my best, my only friend. Zaigri. My Leonora, from the changeful scenes That ever pass before us, let us learn Mild resignation to the will of Heaven. Why should the darkness of the present hour Affect the colour of our future days? That Providence which of vouchsafes to man Illustrious proofs of it's paternal love, Can yet, with ease, disperse this thickening gloom; Restore me to the golden light of freedom; Bid us live long, and through long life, be happy. Leonora. Oh! thou appeaser of my fears, my sorrows, The tempest of my soul; thy soft persuasion Soothes me to peace, as Zephyr breathes on ocean, Tossed by the fury of the northern storm. I'll moderate my woe; watch o'er myself; And expiate, to offended Heaven, and thee! But even this painful interview we're envied; Unwelcome messengers, I fear, approach us. [Enter Torquemada, and two Servants of the Inquisition, armed. SCENE III. Torquemada. What, dare you, then, profane this holy ground With warm emotions of unhallowed love? It would befit thee more, thou infidel, To teach thy stubborn heart to meet salvation, Than thus to be amused with amorous tales! And can the daughter of Medina's duke, Spurn filial duty, reverence to the church; Steal meanly from her home; pollute her soul, With this Mahometan, this wretched Moor; And thus desert the sacred path of peace! Leonora. There is no peace, where Torquemada sways His iron sceptre; but sighs, tears, and groans; Distraction, and despair; outrageous passions, That tear the finer ligaments of nature! Zaigri. Let not this caitiff discompose my fair-one; Break not, for him, thy temper, nor thy promise. I have not power to punish all thy guilt, [To Torquemada. As it deserves.âThou art as weak, as worthless; Therefore, unworthy of expostulation. Whatever destiny I, yet, may feel; Whether I'm on the rack, or on a bed Of roses; I shall ever be the same, To thee, thou fiend; and equally despise The teacher, and the tyrant! Torquemada. Impious boaster! Thou shalt repent the licence of thy tongue, Great Emperour!âThou insolent barbarian! My guards, take off this poor, deluded woman; And reconduct her safely to her father. Zaigri. Now, Leonora, keep thy sacred promise! Give me one moment:âI insist to have it. [To Torquemada. Keep off, ye meanest slaves; ye slaves to priestcraft! [To the Guards advancing towards Leonora. Know, that betwixt this lady, and myself, There is a vow recorded in the skies; And from their court I learn, and from my spirit, That, conscious, warms within me, and asserts It's rightful empire o'er inferiour souls; That with presumptuous, and rude interference, You dare not check one movement of my will; Dare not repress, with ignominious hands, The sacred ardour of this last farewell. [He embraces Leonora. First of thy sex! may happiness be thine! Through fleeting time, and in eternity, May all-sufficient Providence protect thee! Remember me, and universal virtue! Leonora, while they press her off the Stage. Oh! while distress permits my memory To hold it's images, both I'll adore! Oh! hard, intolerable separation! I feel that my existence is divided! I feel it torne to pieces! but my heart, The test of constant love, I leave with Zaigri! [Exit. Zaigri, after two or three turns. The paroxysm of my soul is past. SCENE IV. Enter Ximenes, and Alonzo. Ximenes. Fear not, Alonzo; I shall bear the journey. You'll bid the servants wait, and, then, return. Zaigri, What! is my tutelary genius here! [Alonzo goes, and returns. Torquemada is greatly agitated, and falls back. Ximenes. My worthy, brave, and greatly injured Zaigri! How strange, and how degrading, is our fate! I little thought, that you, and good Alonzo, Should, with myself, e'er meet in PandÃ¦monium; And even before our death! [To Torquemada. Come forth, thou vultur! Thou hast, at length, smelt out the flower of manhood; Torne from my arms my bosom friend!âmy friend! The generous, equal friend of human kind! The glory of our species!âThou hast rouzed A dauntless lion, shamefully asleep, Too long; but now he growls for ample vengeance; Lashes his sides, and quickly will devour thee! Torquemada. Is this the man, who solemnly engaged, And to his dying queen, that he'd protect me; Maintain the dignity, and execution Of my severe, but salutary office? Ximenes. Truth is, thou know'st, the idol of my heart! And thou must likewise know, with loyal worship, How I adore the memory of my queen! I gave to Isabella, on her death-bed, A promise, in thy favour, too restrictive; To which I've payed a doating veneration. I now retract that promise; I annull it; And with the bright, celestial sword of justice, I cut the superstitious gordian knot. Truth is but sacred, for it's glorious ends; And so is every virtue. Sparing thee, I give myself the lye; I tell the world, In conduct, that thy horrid deeds are right; I contradict the Authour of all nature! Let me expunge my crime of dire omission.â âHow shall I punish thee!âI'll give thee back Thyself;âthe sentence which thou hast pronounced On hapless men;âI'll make a bonfire of thee; It will give light, and triumph, to all Spain! Zaigri. If ever, Ximenes, I found thy favour, Wilt thou permit me, humbly to remind thee, That souls, like thine, armed with decisive power, To high authority, howe'er abused, When fallen, and sunk, have still inclined to mercy? Alonzo. And wilt thou, too, forgive thy faithful servant, If he presumes to add his wish humane, That Zaigri, now, may have his usual interest In thy great mind! Ximenes. I love you, for your weakness, My generous friends! It flows from a fine source. But I'm even deaf to Zaigri, and to you; For I've, now, fixed my justice on a rock; And she's impregnable.âNo, Torquemada; Thy heart, sheathed with impenetrable steel, Mine has not force enough to emulate. I never shall inflict a painful death. I'll hang theeâon a statute; 'twas enacted, In the first year of the Creator's reign O'er his own world; when, on their golden lyres, The minstrelsy above tuned dulcet notes, In honour of this nether globe, replete With fair, and with diversified existence; And sung that all was good!âThe statute says, That every tyrant should, in every nation, Be hunted down.âPrime minister of Satan! Thou hast burned men, because they were too honest Even life to purchase with hypocrisy! Before the gates of this infernal dome, I'll have a gallows planted, and as high As Haman's; that the observing world may know, That, in some cases, though I seem neglectful, Sooner, or later, I still raise the man, According to his merits; and that priests, A subtle, cringing, yet, aspiring race; Hell in their hearts; the gospel on their tongues, May dread too high promotion! Torquemada. Ximenes, Thou ever hast inclined to mild decision; Then, on my knees, let me implore thy mercy! Ximenes. Thou hast deserved my most alarming terrours. Know, that I would not take the guiltiest life, Without procedure of fair jurisprudence. Thy office gives thee an unbounded range; And should'st thou, still, supinely be allowed To prowl, at pleasure, thou might'st kill some Zaigri. Then hear my ultimate, decisive sentence; And by the God of equity, and mercy, It shall be executed. Torquemada, You shall be sent, well-guarded, to Madrid; To drag existence, there, in close confinement, During the sad remainder of your days; Far from all friends, all social intercourse; Your sole companions, in an old state-prison, It's death-like silence; it's tremendous gloom. Waste not an hour of your perpetual durance; But strive, by fervent prayer, severest penance, To make atonement for a barbarous life. Torquemada, on his Knees. Yet let me supplicate thy lenity! Ximenes. I will not hear a word; for I'm humane! Guards, bear your prisoner off. Torquemada. Oh! I've been wrong! And rigour merits rigour! [Exit Torquemada. Ximenes. âNow, my Zaigri; If yet awhile I live, I'll give my orders, That the dark shades, the haviour of this place, Shall have a smiling metamorphosis. I've banished, with the talisman of justice, The Necromancer, that, for years, hath ruled it. The sable genii, here, from Pluto's empire, Too long have wreathed their melancholy cypress. But, rather, by my more indulgent magick, It shall display the fane of Cytherea. Not that I mean, with unbecoming licence, To give a sanction to illicit love; But that our future Zaigris, Leonoras, Shall here prepare their hymeneal wreaths, Wreaths of perpetual bloom, perpetual fragrance, And strew the floor with roses.âFare thou well, My friend! my feelings tell me, that to die, Atchieving good, softens the king of terrours! I'll, at Granada, try to find some rest; For flagging nature asks it!âCome, Alonzo! My aid, in life; in death, my consolation! âZaigri, this heart is not yet cold; it breathes An ardent wish for thee! Zaigri. The consciousness That I possess thy friendship, will inspire me With new ambition to deserve it more. Farewell. [Ximenes retires. Zaigri, alone. I have thy wish in strong remembrance! But I should like to act from full conviction, When moved by matters of eternal moment. And when I view thee, with infirmities Pressed down to earth, my sympathetick heart Sinks, too, beneath a load of gratitude; Nor can presume, on themes howe'er important, To trouble thee with farther argument. What mind can cavil at the Christian practice! But on some themes of holy speculation, I have my doubts. I'll go to good Alvarez, The hermit of the dale. I'm sure, he'll solve them; Or not inveigle me with sophistry. Betrayed in youth (before we learn suspicion) By a perfidious world, his shining talents He long hath buried in a devious wild, Adorned with nature's rich, fantastick scenes! I'll not lose time; for I'm impelled by love! All-conquering power! did not thy interest, now, Promote superiour duty; I should fear That o'er it thou wouldst claim despotick sway, And prove victorious! Thou art Heaven below! And, hence, 'tis thine, even in religious minds, To rival, to out-rival, Heaven above! [Exit. SCENE V. Granada. Duke of Medina SidoniaâLeonora. Duke. Who would have thought that ever Leonora, For filial love, for piety renowned, Would, when her virtues were matured, have turned A rebel to her father, and her God! Leonora. Surely, my father, Heaven inspired our reason, To light us to all truth; and, oft, my conduct I've tried with reason freed from prejudice; But I could never find that it deserved These harsh, opprobrious epithets. Duke. Thy passion Gives a wrong biass to thy reason. Canst thou Oppose thy trivial knowledge to the doctrines Which our unerring church hath ratified? Has not a heretick seduced thy love? An everlasting reprobate of Heaven? Leonora. If thou hast formed my mind, with ease, to honour, Let it provoke thee not, that I'm sincere, And too reflecting for implicit faith. In Zaigri, I admire a heart humane, And valiant; intellectual faculties Sublime, and consecrated by the love Of truth. And is the Deity the foe Of this essential piety, from causes External, and contingent? Were our country Only ten leagues from Europe, Mahomet Would have prescribed our faith; without our choice, We should have vowed obedience to the Koran, From reverence to our fathers. Would the Judge Of heaven, and earth, have marked with his displeasure, That amiable, that necessary errour? We should have been condemned, as soon, by him, For any other mode; for dress; for language. Duke. Thou prating infidel! are we to know The moral system of the Deity? And rashly to pronounce on his decrees? Is not thy boldness checked, when he declares In his own oraclesââI will have mercy âOn whom I will have mercy?ââLeonora, I have not patience for a vain debate; Resolve to conquer a profane attachment; Or to the grave I shall descend with sorrow! Leonora. Oh! I will rather droop, and die, grief's victim! Name any arduous task within my power; And I'll perform it, to preserve my father! Duke. Determine, then, to think no more of Zaigri. Leonora. Alas! my lord; I fear that you require Impossibility! Even reason's thoughts, With colder, slower march, will oft invade The breast, in lonely hours! But to arrest The fleet, and glowing pictures of warm fancy, Rising in sighs, and darting to their object, When the soul works, in fertile solitude, Would be, to check the lightning's fiery wing, In transit through a still, and lowering sky. But though the varied motions of my mind May prove too quick, and subtle for controul, 'Tis virtue's privilege to govern action; And I'll be watchful, never, in my conduct, To wound my conscience, or afflict my father. Duke. If thou art now sincere; if with thy words Thou art resolved to correspond in action, Reject all future intercourse with Zaigri. If thou observest this injunction, peace, Serenity, and happiness, are mine. But should it be contemned, thy disobedience With melancholy will oppress my age. Leonora. Than thy distress, the worst of ills;âpain, death, Would be less evils to me!âI'll obey thee! Duke. Now am I blest! I ever did repose On thy affection, on thy truth. I'll leave thee, In calm retirement, and thy own reflexions, To taste the sweets of filial piety; How purer, more sublime, are our enjoyments, Resulting from a firm discharge of duty, Than all the fancied bliss of youthful passion! [Exit. Leonora, alone. I could not make a greater sacrifice Than what I've offered to a father's claim! Oh! Zaigri, in thy generous mind, the motive Will plead thy pardon of my dread resolve! I know, 'twill wound thy heart; but be assured, That all it's pangs will be returned by mine. With what acuteness ('tis presumed) we argue Against a force, or weakness, not residing In our own breast!âMy father's prejudices Flow not from sordid sources.âPride Castilian; A zeal intemperate for our holy faith! These are the foes to Zaigri, and to me! But is not, oft, the groveling lust of gold, That putrid fever of the soul, in age, The tyrant of a fine, a noble flame? Doth it not fancy, in it's wild delirium, That avarice is a virtue, love, a crime?â âBut what are cool, and sage remarks, to me? âWere not our souls, in sight of Heaven, united!â And am not I now torne, divorced from Zaigri? âOh! what a pathless desart is the world! [Exit Leonora. SCENE VI. Granada. Ximenes, alone, reposing on a Sofa. What comfort have I felt from this repose! It recreates the poor remains of life. But who invades my solitude?âAlonzo! [Enters Alonzo. Alonzo. My lord, I interrupt, with great reluctance, Your quiet; but there is a cause;âGiraldo, Honoured with your esteem, has been imprudent; He warmly urged me to request an audience. Ximenes. I've heard a strange report; and much it grieves me, Admit him instantly. [Alonzo retires. My life is destined, To it's expiring hour, to change, and tumult. When shall I reach the tranquil hemisphere, Eternally serene!âWhat object meets me! Giraldo, and in chains! [Giraldo enters, manacled, and guarded; and Alonzo. Why do you bring My friend, an honest, generous, valiant man, Thus chained, and guarded, like a desperate felon? 1st Guard. My lord, we can produce our witnesses, To prove, that he has murdered Baracaldo: But from his love of truth, from his frank nature, We are persuaded, that he'll own the fact. It was determined, that his crime should flow Along the common stream of legal justice. But, with much ardour, he requested leave To make his first appeal to you: our state Owes great indulgence to the brave Giraldo: He, for his judge, deserves a Ximenes. Ximenes. Giraldo, thy defence I wish to hear; And yet I dread to hear it; my esteem For thee, hath corresponded with thy virtues. 'Tis I, who suffer all the culprit's fears! Giraldo. This breast, my lord, fear hath not yet invaded: Honour hath, for itself, no cause to fear. My sword I've crimsoned with a villain's blood: I've put an end to Baracaldo's crimes; His life I've taken, which he owed to thee. I have performed a noble act of justice. Ximenes. But by thy arm, I'm stabbed, through Baracaldo! Alas! how oft do great, exalted souls, Who, we would almost wish, might live for ever, Their ruin court, by deeds precipitate! If Baracaldo, guiltless of a charge Imputed to him, fell, I grieve for him: But, oh! my aged heart bleeds for Giraldo! Giraldo. Why? that the traitor poisoned Ximenes, I can convince the world; and if the world, In retribution fair, my last atchievement Crowns with the patriot's deathless wreath of glory, To an ignoble fate wilt thou consign me? Ximenes. Heaven's clemency forbid that I condemn thee! By our established laws thou must be tried, And judges.âHad thy unimpassioned reason Controuled thy generous heart's excess!âThis scene I wish to close;â'tis agonizing to me! Giraldo, I am old; for many years, I've been in power, too apt to taint the heart; Now, when I tottering stand on the grave's brink, I cannot find that I have stained my life With one oppressive, one injurious act; Though by such acts, oft, with impunity, My friends I might have spared, or have promoted; Enriched myself, or gratified revenge, Even by great souls too warmly entertained. Next to my God, I've always worshipped justice; It is his type; his representative; In it's full sense, it means, whatever good Can be performed by reasoning, conscious beings. Justice is dearer to me than Giraldo! Giraldo. My heart as yet retains it's satisfaction For having prompted this intrepid hand! Nor do I meanly wish thou may'st relinquish, On my account, thy well-earned palm of justice; Bright ornament of venerable age! Ximenes. Ill-fated warmth! are we to supersede, By our rash thoughts, divine, and human laws! Are we to seize the flaming bolts of Heaven! Perhaps God means to punish guilt enormous, By suffering it to live; or, has he not A high tribunal in the other world, Of universal, and compleat redress? Giraldo. There I rely.âYou've told me that âyou wished âTo close this scene;â'tis agonizing to you.â Then hear a word or two, and I depart. Firmly, you know, I've oft encountered death, Bristled with horrour, in the martial field. And firmly on the scaffold I can face him, If I should suffer in a manly cause. I humbly will expect that high tribunal, Which will atone for earth's iniquity! Farewell, good cardinal!âperhaps, for ever! [Exit Giraldo. Ximenes. âAlonzo, go; and till I recollect Full presence of my mind, stop all proceedings Against Giraldo. Alonzo. I obey, with pleasure. [Exit Alonzo. Ximenes, alone. This cruel conflict rends my languid heart! Under the banner of Toledo's cross, My gallant soldier fought before Oran. The quick, pure effervescence of his youth Announced the virtues of his riper years. Just as the troops were forming, in my tent, My orders he received; and asked my blessing; For on the strength of that viaticum, I'm sure, said he, to conquer, or to die, Anticipating Heaven! His warmth shot through me! I gave the benediction, with a tear, Dropt from anxiety, from hope, from joy. He left me; joined his squadron; and like lightning, He charged, and broke the thickest of the foe! He was all, fire, all, friendship; and all, honour; Therefore, my celibacy's chosen son! And he has forfeited a glorious life, From his enthusiastick zeal for me! What shall I do, to save this generous man!â âI'll interpose:âbut, then, I shall wound justice! And if I keep aloof, I lose Giraldo! This is the heaviest shock that, yet, I've suffered: It, now, precipitates the fatal stroke On agitated, and expiring age! Oh! thou, whom my soul loveth!âOh! Giraldo! My son, my son!âWould, I might die for thee! [Exit Ximenes. End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Cave of the Hermit Alvarez: a beautiful, and romantick prospect: in it's interiour Part, the Hermit's Cave. A Rock, verdure, Wood; a Stream. The Hermit, and Zaigri, advancing from the Cave. Hermit. And have I, then, my noble prince, completed our god-like regent's work of thy conversion? Great is the pleasure, to me; great the honour. Zaigri. Thou hast, indeed, Alvarez; and I feel The happiest hour that e'er inspired my life; It strews my path of time with richest flowers; And spreads before my eye those distant objects, Approximated by the power of fancy, Which, with their glowing tints, their forms expressive, Adorn, diversity, and animate The golden regions of eternal day. Alvarez. Permit me, then, to aid thy memory, For thy important use;âmore to collect, Compress, concenter, in a moral focus, Those topicks which we have discussed, at large. Zaigri. I'll hear thee with a fixed, a warm attention. Alvarez. The mysteries of our faith, as they're enounced In holy writ, be sure, were never meant, By the pure Source of reason, peace, and love, For objects of perplexed, fatiguing study; Yet less for hot, and rancorous disputation. In intellect, compared with higher scales Of being, we're but pygmies;âthere are truths Of so abstruse, or so sublime a nature, That they admit not sounds for mortal ears, Nor the conceptions of embodied minds. Yet are these mysteries not expressed, in vain. Before the empyreal throne of God, When we imbibe his presence; when we quaff Knowledge, and immortality; to learn Those hidden truths completely; and to trace, With easy penetration, their allusions, Reciprocated from the different parts Of both the sacred codes; their harmony, Hence, to admire, with more exalted rapture, May be our glorious privilege! Zaigri. Alvarez! While I persue thy reason, and thy fancy, I own thy force, and I adopt thy flame! Alvarez. Meanwhile, my son, these mysteries are inserted, Though their extent, their substance, be not known, With striking emphasis, in our religion; They give a grandeur to the solemn fabrick; And to a pious temper mould the spirit. Perhaps we should not worship even the First Of Beings, with such humble adoration, And fervour, were he not, the Great Unknown! The mind, for every noble enterprize; For all it's noble tones, and energies, Requires the grand, the vast, the infinite. Hence, the brown horrours of the deepening shade, Impervious to the eye, delight the soul, Intent on strains of matchless eloquence, Enforcing publick virtue. Hence, a forest, Lofty in height, thick with umbrageous honours, Was the true nymph Egeria, to sage Numa, While he, with civil, and with sacred laws, Improved the majesty of ancient Rome. And, hence, the poet, in his walks retired, At calm, and dusky eve (an ivied ruin, Of age, and perfect symmetry, imagined, With active magick raising the fine sprites) Sees, through the eye of fancy, airy forms, Gleam, and evolve, and sport athwart the glade, O'ershadowed with the night's approaching awe. But Zaigri, I forget what I proposed; I promised to contract, and I expand. Zaigri. Thou art concise, to my engaged attention! Charming analogist! what pity 'tis, That your religion, breathing love, and formed, To spread it's genial empire o'er the world, Should not be, ever, thus pourtrayed in smiles, And ne'er distorted to unnatural frowns! Alvarez. 'Tis, that I'm independent of mankind, Have, long been freed from all connexion with them; Contagious, ever, to our peace, and virtue! That I've acquired this beautiful religion. I owe those truths ethereal, which my spirit Attract, more, and more strongly, to the Father Of spirits, to my reason's full exertion; My reason uncorrupted, undisturbed; I owe them to that humble roof of nature; That grove, that river; that profound retirement. Zaigri. Father, it grieves me, that our intercourse With our own kind, essential, to produce The polished arts, and every great atchievement, Should wage, in it's reverse, perpetual war With innocence, tranquility, and virtue. Alvarez. Just, the complaint, and just is thy regret. Yes, Zaigri; had I been a selfish artist, And figured in the drama of the world; Perhaps, I, now, had been a feverish prelate, Fired with ambition, and malignant zeal; Had turned eternal order to confusion; Mangled, with rash, and sacrilegious hand, The word of life; made mysteries more mysterious; Promulged some empty, doating, jingling creed, And arrogated, with imperial frown, The blind assent of nations. Rebel Reason, Perhaps, had spurned, with glorious contumacy: Then I had poured my deadly, priestly poison, Through some weak monarch's superstitious ear; Listed him in the devil's cause, and told him That it was God's!âThe martial trump had sounded; And from the banners, while the cross of Peace, Emblem of universal charity, Had streamed, and floated, with dire solecism, Over our fell crusaders, I had deluged Whole realms with blood! Zaigri. Benign, humane Alvarez! Methinks, the ghosts of my great ancestors, Of many gallant, slaughtered Moors, are, now, Impending o'er us, to give evidence To thy distressful, but authentick picture! Hapless, illustrious, venerated shades! Heaven has avenged, or will avenge, your cause! Alvarez. You leave a cause, involving human kind, With him, whose equity is pure, whose power Omnipotent.âThe ceremonies, rites, The pomp of our religion, we agreed, On fair examination, were not themes For thy severe objection. Long experience Clearly demonstrates, that the major part, The vulgar of mankind; our general species, Must to their pious duty be allured, And fixed, by solemn, or by splendid objects, That charm, or awe, their minds, in common life. Therefore, as he, who pays his publick homage To these appendages of piety, Which need not check the vitals of religion, Her salutary, her sublime exertions, Acts, the good citizen, the friend of man; They ne'er will find a caviller in Zaigri. Zaigri. Alvarez, I'm completely satisfied. All Spain shall know that I'm a proselyte, Ere many days elapse. Farewell, thou teacher Of perfect righteousness; if I should fail Thee to revisit soon, I should reproach This honest heart with base ingratitude. Alvarez. Farewell! may Heaven's good Providence preside O'er all thy thoughts, and all thy actions! [He turns, and goes towards his Cave; he returns, and says to Zaigri;â Stay; One warm remembrance more, my son;âobserve it, Above all faith, all zeal; all other practice; Itself is all.âBe actively humane; For true humanity is proved by deeds: As nought but feeling for another's woe Can wound the bliss of virtue, the good man (As our grim priests will compass sea, and land, To stab the soul, to make one proselyte!) Will travel patiently, from pole to pole, To see the cruel grief that he can soothe! He will not only cheer the hoary widow, Who shivers at his door, and bid her smile; But he will traverse all Arabia's sands, If he can but substract a single unit From the dread aggregate of human ills. He'll plunge into a dangerous sea of sorrow; He'll dive into the dank, and noisome dungeon; And there, to poverty, and crimes, by culprits Of greater guilt, in elevated office, To the worst fate condemned, this god-like man Will blooming health restore, and purer air, And, in their breasts, the rays of hope relumine! Zaigri. A glorious doctrine! and my soul assures me, It is not difficult!âFarewell, Alvarez! [Exeunt. SCENE II. Alonzo, and Gatinara. Alonzo. My worthy Gatinara, many years Have now elapsed, since we enjoyed together Our lively hours of youth, that made time rapid! I, from two causes, am o'erjoyed to meet thee! The pleasing sight of a sincere, old friend, Gives back our past, and, oft, our best existence; And, sure, thy message, at this crisis, brings Grateful intelligence to Ximenes. But Gatinara, what peculiar object Is agitated at the court of Brussels? I'm not presuming to inquire too far. Gatinara. What much employs our minds, must actuate yours; Our sovereign's voyage to his realms of Spain; The preparations for this great event Are all compleated; many hearts, Alonzo, Now burn with loyal prayers; but more with anxious Wishes of private interest, and ambition. A letter to your venerable regent, Which only to himself I must deliver, With the most expeditious use of time, Was, by our minister, with me entrusted. Then wilt thou, soon, Alonzo, for thy friend, Procure an audience of the cardinal? Alonzo. Dispatch has been, with me, a golden rule; And sure it's practice I'll exert for thee. Two objects of important magnitude Will mark this sad, yet this auspicious Ã¦ra; The long-desired arrival of our prince; And, much I fear, the death of Ximenes. Age, complicated cares of government, And deadly poison, press him to the grave. Curse on the iron heart that first suggested, The head that plotted, and the hand that laid This baleful ambush for my honoured master; Of Spain the glory, to the human race A friend, and an illustrious ornament! Although his pulse of life it's usual office Performs with feeble, and reluctant motion, His loyal heart still pants to meet his sovereign; And, with that view, forthwith he purposes A journey to Aranda! Ximenes, Like all great souls, on fire for arduous deeds, Is, to the last, consistent; of himself Is emulous; and even with death contends. King never owed so deep a debt to subject, As stands betwixt our monarch, and his regent. Excuse me Gatinara; honest zeal Makes me forget my promise; let us go; You shall not be detained by my delay. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Duke of Medina SidoniaâZaigri. Zaigri. You say, you're satisfied, my lord;âI'm happy: Then wound me not with your apologies. Even active malice I forgive, with ease, When it's hostilities no more can hurt me. But should I have a heart inexorable To honest prejudices; nor, with candour, Meet their conciliating, benignant smile, How grossly would myself be prejudiced! Environed, from our birth, with favourite objects, Of ease, love, pleasure, friendship, veneration, Which model, and attach, with strong controul, The willing senses, the resisting mind; Should we boast freedom from all prepossession, The mortal man would arrogate the angel. I have my prejudices; 'tis my study, To soften, to subdue them. Duke. Royal Zaigri! In soul a king! These noble sentiments Reproach my opposition to thy wishes. Zaigri. 'Tis an unmeant reproach. Besides, those wishes No longer thou opposest; hence, my Lord, Each thought, here entertained, is, now, thy friend. 'Tis thy esteem that gives me Leonora; And can I feel resentment against thee! Strange, most unnatural animosity! The fortunate in love, were never captious. 'Tis a conciliating, refining passion;â Absorbs all other cares; represses, foils, Annihilates each mean propensity! 'Tis our internal sun; without it's power, Souls of fine temper feel existence dreary; From it's full influence, life yields true fruition; And all is animation; all is joy! âMy Lord, I've told you my determination; 'Tis, to renounce the worship of my fathers, On the next Sabbath, and to be baptised Into the Christian faith. You'll, then, excuse Impatience in a lover; ardently I wish, that Leonora heard these tidings; You, now, completely may contrast her pain. Duke. I will not lose a moment to oblige you. [He rings. Though while this obligation is conferred, I but perform the duty of a father. [Enters a Servant. You'll tell my daughter, that I wish to see her. [Exit Servant. [Leonora enters, pays her compliments, with confusion, to both. Zaigri, advancing, and bowing to her. At length, my virtuous love of Leonora Obtains the sacred sanction of her father. Leonora. Where am I? do I wake? or do I dream? And yet, my dreams were ever more portentous! Sure, Zaigri cannot mock me; sure, my father Can never taunt the miseries of his daughter! Duke. Thy lover, Leonora, is a Christian! Leonora. The news, you'll think, my Lord, should give me rapture! As yet, it but produces agitation, That wildly flutters 'twixt the two extremes Of joyful, and of mortifying thoughts! I know, he has not changed his faith, from fear; I hope, he has not changed his faith, from love. Zaigri. The Moors, fair Leonora, are as truthful As your Castilians;âknow that I'm a Christian, A proselyte, from rational conviction; From the result of calm, and close inquiry; From the free choice of an impartial mind. He, who, for truth, shrunk not from racks, or flames, Would, but, alone, for that celestial object, With equal firmness, quit the joys of love. My counsellours, in this important change, Were, an Alvarez, and a Ximenes; Judge of their knowledge, their integrity. Leonora. Then, is this hour most prodigal of bliss Of all that ever crowned my day with pleasure. Good Heaven! I thank thee for my sufferings past! They give a double zest to present joy! As April's tears augment the flush of spring! Thou surely canst not think I entertain [To Zaigri. A moment's doubt of thy sincerity. Each eye, my Lord, with common visual ray, [To the Duke. May, to the bottom see, of Zaigri's soul: It is a pure, a clear, ambrosial fountain, Reflecting every object it contains, In it's true magnitude, and form, and colour. Sordid hypocrisy, and noble Zaigri, Are, ever, farther than the poles, asunder: Such men as he, are images of God! Duke. Daughter, I love thee for thy honest ardour; But let it know it's bounds, nor blaze to rapture. Leonora. Oh! pardon me, my venerated father! My mind must, now, take it's unbounded range! This rapture let me offer, now, to Zaigri, An incense far inferiour to his merit. Long hath he toiled, and often courted danger, To earn the hero's laurel, in the field; Then, for this bridegroom's brow, 'tis mine, to form A wreath of chaste, and ever-blooming myrtle. Why, at this crisis, need I fear to open The intimate recesses of my soul? No!âlet the venal, and ambitious fair, Dupes to life's idle pageants, wealth, and grandeur, Who, with bold perjuries, at Heaven's dread altar, Astonish trembling saints, and listening angels, Observers vigilant of human actions;â Let them, with specious manners, specious words, Varnish their guilt, and act a laboured part; The artless mind has nothing to conceal. Duke. Proceed, without reserve; I'll not be wounded By thy integrity; thy father taught thee, Even from thy infancy, to be sincere. Leonora. I now evince my reverence to his precepts; And such a proof, I trust, will ne'er offend. Although with pious, and observant heart, The hallowed faith I worship, of my fathers, Yet should I live, in some retreat, with Zaigri, Remote from the communion of the church, And of the world; and should we, there, converse, As we were used, in sacred dialogue, On virtue, on eternity, on God; I should, nor with temerity, conclude, We practised, then, the Catholick religion; I should forget it's engines, in it's essence: And with the rising, and descending sun, With holy warmth, if we should kneel, together, Beneath the foliage of some lofty grove, Which undulated to the breath of Zephyr, And bowed Heaven's acquiescence to our prayer; I should be satisfied, that our devotions Were offered in a consecrated temple; Nor painfully be anxious to frequent The churches of Madrid, or Saragossa. Our mansion in the humble vale of life; Zaigri's fair fame; his animating converse; My emulation of his great example, And Heaven's paternal eye, would prove, to me, All wealth, all power, all grandeur, all religion! Zaigri. Oh! Leonora! if, to eloquence, Thy lover had been trained, instead of arms, The noble tribute of thy generous praise The orator could never have repayed! No words are adequate; it must be thanked By my endeavours to deserve it more! Duke. Love, and romance, I find, are still connected. We must allow their union. Thy excess [To Leonora. Is beauteous; for it flows from ardent virtue! Zaigri. We fixed the time, my Lord, when my conversion Should, in your church, be fully ratified. Let me request, on that auspicious day, The hand of Leonora; let my wish Meet your acceptance. Duke. Never was proposal More grateful to my ear. Leonora. And if it drew my frown, After a life thus far to truth devoted, A moment would have taught me to dissemble. Zaigri, embracing her. Thanks inexpressible my soul returns thee, For this last proof of thy sincerity! But let us, without loss of time, my friends, With this eventful, and propitious scene, A little strength impart, and steddier flame, To our good regent's quivering lamp of life. His feeble age is, like his vigorous youth, Employed; he still promotes the good of man. Then, you may judge, with what a lively sense, He feels the happiness of those he loves. My lord, I'll follow you.âMy Leonora! Our fortune shows that we should ne'er despond. Let fell despair, at length, assail the breast Long obstinate in crimes; 'twas never meant By Heaven, that the wild fiend should seize on virtue! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Ximenes, Alonzo, and Gatinara. Ximenes, supported by Alonzo. Nature, I, now, feel quite exhausted in me; But he, who dies, in the discharge of duty, Provides himself, for his departing soul, A good viaticum: well, Gatinara, Pray, what is your commission? from my king, A message, even before 'tis known, revives me. [He seats himself on a sofa. Gatinara. I have a letter for your Excellence, Which to deliver only to yourself, I strictly was enjoined. [He gives to Ximenes the letter. Ximenes. Read it, Alonzo; I know that Gatinara may be trusted. Alonzo, reads. âWe have your services in good remembrance; âBut our arrival on the Spanish coast, âWhither we mean, without delay, to sail, âThink not, with your infirmities, to welcome, âIn person; therefore, when you've read this letter, âStrait, to your holy see, and peace, retire. âYou've led a life of spirit, and of action; âBut gentler, better scenes, your age demands; âEase, and a calm attention to the souls âCommitted to your care, and to your own. âFarewell, good Cardinal; may Heaven protect you. Charles, Rex.â [While Alonzo reads the letter, the action of Ximenes expresses grief, and horrour; at the close of it, he faints. Alonzo. I fear, this letter was the dart of death; It must pierce all who know the worth it wounds. Gatinara. At a most inauspicious time it reached him; I dread the consequence!âBut he recovers! Ximenes. Alonzo; did mine ear inform me rightly? Although this royal mandate was inhuman, I felt it far too deeply;âslagging nature Deserts, betrays, the vigour of my mind! Is this my aged loyalty's reward? âYes, feeble as I am, my zealous heart Proposed to meet it's prince!âUngenerous letter! It is a snake, not half-concealed in flowers! Am I disgraced, when, surely, I deserved A civick wreath!âBut, haply, I forgot, Lost in the business, and the pomp of state, The sacred page that warns us not to trust In princes! I have now, for fifty years, Been anxious, been industrious to augment The Spanish glory!âShade of Isabella! Now long beatified! Fair, great, and good! How would thy soul have shuddered, thus to treat An old, and faithful servant!âWho disturbs me? [A rap without; Alonzo advances towards the door. A Messenger, says, The Moorish prince, Medina's duke, his daughter, Desire to speak with Ximenes. Alonzo. He cannot Admit them now. Ximenes. Receive them, good Alonzo; I still can give attention to my friends: My life is short; once more I'll see, and hear them. Let me expire, myself; and to this letter, Which looks a dÃ¦mon, give an angel's office; Yes;âlet it break the feeble ligaments, Which hold me yet to earth. [Enter Duke, Zaigri, Leonora. Ximenes. Welcome, my friends! Read, here, a living, yet, a dying lesson; 'Tis useful; and (farewell reserve!) 'tis big With the deformity of human nature! My noble Duke; though you, and I, have differed, I know your heart so well, and my own conscience, That, I'm persuaded, you'll regret my fall! Duke. Even when thy power, with vigour, was directed Against my family; trust me, this heart Breathed an involuntary kiss of homage Toward thy threatening hand! my soul is wounded, To see thy discomposure!âBut explain A word of mystery;âwhat means, thy fall? Ximenes. It seems, the sight of me, would hurt our sovereign! He even anticipates a friend's disgrace; And to perpetual exile from his presence, Condemns me, ere himself arrives in Spain. This cruel thought disarms my resolution; And stimulates, again, my pungent feelings! 'Twas an unkind return, for all the plans, Formed, for his greatness, in this aged head, Whiter, perhaps, by ardent cares for him, Than by the frost of time!âMy God, forgive me, Who seest our inmost springs of thought, and action; Seest, how this blow must shock my languid mind, In natural sympathy with a weak body!â Forgive me, after I aspired to Heaven, For this relapse to earth!âI'll change my objects. Zaigri, to you, and to fair Leonora, I sooner should have payed a friend's attention. Speak;âtell me all you wish that I should know, While I have power to hear it! Zaigri. First, my Lord, Accept the sorrow of two friendly bosoms, That share the conflict of thy noble mind! Leonora. Heaven is my witness, were my earthly bliss Whatever love, and virtue can imagine, My knowledge of thy wrongs, oh! Ximenes! And of thy sufferings, would obscure it's lustre! Ximenes. Old as I am, I credit what you say. Zaigri. Fool that I was, inured to disappointments, I fondly hoped, with pleasure unallayed, To tell thee, that, from conscience, I abjure The sensual paradise of Mahomet, And am a convert to the Christian law. The frankness of thy honest proselyte Forthwith receives an ample retribution; Paternal sanction to a lover's wishes; The nuptial hand, and heart of Leonora. Ximenes. You've always, in essentials, been a Christian: Hence, your transition to our form is easy. I'm pleased that you renounce pernicious tenets, Enforcing bloodshed, and licentious rapine. Zaigri's example will produce effects Powerful, and salutary.âBoth approach; [They approach and kneel. And take my benediction.âHealth, peace, virtue, And her best retributions in this world, Be ever yours, through a precarious life! And to your future wishes, may Heaven's mercy Open the gates of everlasting day! âA heavy vapour swims before my sight! A deathful chillness, too, creeps through my heart! Alonzo! Alonzo. My good lord! Ximenes. Look well, and tell me, What secretary wrote that cruel letter? Alonzo; âafter having examined the Letter. I'm certain of the hand, my lord; 'tis Mota's. Ximenes. And did not shame check his ingratitude? Then our young king, and his amanuensis, Hold forth two dire examples of mankind. I trained the rising talents of this Mota, With my expence, and care; nor did I quit My close attention to him, till I fixed him In opulence, and power episcopal! Is this the merit that deserves a mitre! Can consecration lock the human heart With selfishness, and flint!âFarewell, for ever, To these detested objects!âGatinara! Is Gatinara there? Gatinara. My lord, I'm with you. Ximenes. Mark what I say;âone favour of your prince, And only one I beg; Giraldo's life. He stabbed a traitor, and a murderer; Some, not responsible to this world's justice, Give an assassin's blow to their best friends. âMay Fame forgive me, if, while I'm contending With the keen wounds of black ingratitude, And with my last mortal infirmities, My history closes with defective glory. I, who have often struck the base, the mean, With trembling fear, humiliate, now, myself. But with a farewell effort, I'll collect My parting soul; that it may wing it's flight, With all it's native, it's habitual vigour. For I am going to the king of kings, The final sentence of whose dread tribunal No petty monarch of our earth escapes; And where the worthy find their due reward: No Austrian cabinet can wrong me, there. My God; my Father! If, through a long life, I've worshipped thee, in spirit, and in truth; If, justice, in proportion to my power, I still have executed; if distress, Whene'er its woes I knew, still found, in me, An ardent, indefatigable friend; Accept thy servant with paternal mercy! And, if, to crush the proud, the insolent; To baffle malice, and to humble tyrants; Important offices, for publick weal, Sometimes, my consequence, in my own eyes, The individual's pride, was too much pleased; Forgive my frailty, for the general good, Which even the narrow love of self effected! âSure nature stagnates, now, through all my frame! How cold, and dark it feels!âThis faithless world Recedes!âIt flies before me!âHonest Zaigri! Thy image, too, I lose!âBut we shall meet In realms of purer life!âIn light eternal! [He dies. Leonora. Ne'er will his voice again instruct his friends! Our just, our generous regent is no more! Duke. He's dead!âAnd Spain hath lost her brightest glory! Why need we wonder, that his thread of life, A long, and shining thread, already worne Extremely fine, by this last stroke was severed? Keen was the fatal stroke, and unexpected! Alonzo. Mysterious Heaven! Thou, only, canst atone For the hard fate of my illustrious master! Poison had, more than age, wasted his body; A poisoned shaft hath, now, transfixed his mind! Zaigri. As great a soul, this instant, hath expired, As e'er departed, with it's mortal breath. If genius, of resistless energy, Splendid, at once, and useful; and if virtue, Of finest temperature, sublimest ardour, Both, long exerted in distinguished station, Can make man's memory august, his fame Will last, and flourish, to the end of time! His life repeats a document to mortals, Of the first moral import. Let the gay, The thoughtless, and licentious, think, awhile, What future miseries, even, here, await them; Since he, though temperate, sage; though just, and good, Experienced insults, disappointments, pains. And if to Ximenes, for princely favours, Ingratitude most barbarous was returned, Let vice, appalled with melancholy fear, Let virtue, kindled with hope's golden rays, Expect the justice of their God, hereafter, Compleated, in the equitable world! [Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The EPILOGUE; Written by the Authour, and intended for Leonora. Ladies, I must confess, I've played the fool; But when could reason love romantick rule? For though you'll own that valour graced the Moor, And truth; yet he was execrably poor; I, the first heiress in the realms of Spain, And he, without an acre of domain! Titles we idolize; and I had been, In Zaigri's wife, a titulary queen; But what effects proceed from rank alone? âOur numerous wants are eminently shown; Chill penury with frost intenser stings; And sharpens all the ridicule she brings. From Corsicaâthe fact we all must know; It passed, not half a century ago (Before Paoli's grew Timoleon's fame)â A hapless king, and Theodore his name, A prisoner in the fleet, resigned his breath, Where oft enormous debts are payed;âby death. Say, while he breathed it's inauspicious air, Did luxury, did flattery soothe him, there? Did one good statesman, free from courtly guile, Grieve at his frown, or triumph in his smile? Than with a phantom struck, to wed renown, A barren laurel, or ideal crown; Better, to sink in ignominious down; To bid our Cupid take his prudent stand On some rough northern squire's extensive land; Or, by an alderman's unwieldy side, To sleep;âor wake;âat least, a wealthy bride. Yet, there's a truth betwixt each false extreme, The selfish blunder, and the airy dream; And nature will, sometimes, resistless rise, A glorious rebel, against art's disguise; And force even folly to be truly wise. Sage parents, and ye modish fair, excuse The momentary sermon of the muse. A venal world, impatient to be sold, Rashly ascribes omnipotence to gold: But there's a source of bliss to married life, Of Hymen's brightest honours, to the wife; A worth, unmoved by fortune's blind controul, Enthroned, enshrined, for ever, in the soul; Diffusing orient rays, that far outshine The stars terrestrial from Golconda's mine!</field>
