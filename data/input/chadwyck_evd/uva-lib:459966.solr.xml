      <field name="fulltext">THE BRITISH ENCHANTERS: OR, No MAGICK like LOVE. A DRAMATICK POEM, WITH SCENES, MACHINES, MUSICK, and DECORATIONS, &amp;c.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE PREFACE. Of all publick Spectacles, that, which should properly be called an Opera, is calculated to give the highest Delight. There is hardly any Art but what is required to furnish towards the Entertainment; and there is something or other to be provided that may touch every Sense, and please every Palate. The Poet has a two-fold Task upon his Hands in the Dramatick, and the Lyrick: The Architect, the Painter, the Composer, the Actor, the Singer, the Dancer, &amp;c. have each of them their several Employments in the Preparation, and in the Execution. The same Materials indeed, in different Hands, will have different Success; all depends upon a skilful Mixture of the various Ingredients: A bad Artist will make but a meer Hodge-podge with the same Materials that one of a good Taste shall prepare an excellent Olio. The Seasoning must be Sense; unless there is wherewithal to please the Understanding, the Eye and the Ear will soon grow tired. The French Opera is perfect in the Decorations, the Dancing, and Magnificence; the Italian excels in the Musick and Voices; but the Drama falls short in both. An English Stomach requires something solid and substantial, and will rise hungary from a Regale of nothing but Sweet-meats. An Opera is a kind of Ambigu: The Table is finely illuminated, adorned with Flowers and Fruits, and every thing that the Season affords fragrant or delightful to the Eye or the Odour; but unless there is something too for the Appetite, 'tis odds but the Guests break up dissatisfied. It is incumbent upon the Poet alone to provide for that, in the Choice of his Fable, the Conduct of his Plot, the Harmony of his Numbers, the Elevation of his Sentiments, and the Justness of his Characters. In this consists the Solid and the Substantial. The Nature of this Entertainment requires the Plot to be formed upon some Story in which Enchanters and Magicians have a principal Part: In our modern Heroick Poems, they supply the Place of the Gods with the Ancients, and make a much more natural Appearance by being Mortals, with the Difference only of being endowed with supernatural Power. The Characters should be great and illustrious; the Figure the Actor makes upon the Stage, is one part of the Ornament; by consequence the Sentiments must be suitable to the Characters in which Love and Honour will have the principal Share. The Dialogue, which in the French and Italian is set to Notes, and sung, I would have pronounced; if the Numbers are of themselves harmonious, there will be no need of Musick to set them off; a good Verse, well pronounced, is in it self musical; and Speech is certainly more natural for Discourse, than singing. Can any thing be more preposterous than to behold Cato, Julius CÃ¦sar, and Alexander the Great, strutting upon the Stage in the figure of Songsters, personated by Eunuchs? The Singing, therefore, should be wholly applied to the Lyrical part of the Entertainment, which by being freed from a tiresome, unnatural Recitative, must certainly administer more reasonable Pleasure. The several Parts of the Entertainment should be so suited to relieve one another, as to be tedious in none; and the Connexion should be such, that not one should be able to subsist without the other; like Embroidery, so fixt and wrought into the Substance, that no part of the Ornament could be removed, without tearing the Stuff. To introduce Singing and Dancing, by Head and Shoulders, no way relative to the Action, does not turn a Play into an Opera; tho' that Title is now promiscuously given to every Farce sprinkled here and there with a Song and a Dance. The richest Lace, ridiculously set on, will make but a Fool's Coat. I will not take upon me to criticise what has appeared of this kind on the English Stage: We have several Poems under the Name of Dramatick Operas by the best Hands; but in my Opinion the Subjects for the most part have been improperly chosen; Mr. Addison's Rosamond, and Mr. Congreve's Semele, tho' excellent in their kind, are rather Masques, than Operas. As I cannot help being concern'd for the Honour of my Country, even in the minutest things, I am for endeavouring to out-do our Neighbours in Performances of all Kinds. Thus, if the Splendor of the French Opera, and the Harmony of the Italian, were so skilfully interwoven with the Charms of Poetry, upon a regular Dramatick Bottom, as to instruct, as well as delight, to improve the Mind, as well as ravish the Sense, there can be no doubt but such an Addition would entitle our English Opera to the Preference of all others. The third Part of the Encouragaement, of which we have been so liberal to Foreigners for a Consort of Musick only, mis-call'd an Opera, would more than effect it. In the Construction of the following Poem, the Author has endeavoured to set an Example to his Rules; Precepts are best explained by Examples; an abler Hand might have executed it better. However, it may serve for a Model to be improv'd upon, when we grow weary of Scenes of low Life, and return to a Taste of more generous Pleasures. We are reproached by Foreigners with such unnatural Irregularities in our Dramatick Pieces, as are shocking to all other Nations; even a Swiss has play'd the Critick upon us, without considering they are as little approved by the Judicious in our own. A Stranger who is ignorant of the Language, and incapable of judging of the Sentiments, condemns by the Eye, and concludes what he hears to be as extravagant as what he sees: When Oedipus breaks his Neck out of a Balcony, and Jocasta appears in her Bed, murdering herself and her Children, instead of moving Terror, or Compassion, such Spectacles only fill the Spectator with Horror: No wonder if Strangers are shock'd at such Sights, and conclude us a Nation hardly yet civiliz'd, that can seem to delight in them. To remove this Reproach, it is much to be wished our Scenes were less bloody, and the Sword and Dagger more out of Fashion. To make some amends for this Exclusion, I would be less severe as to the Rigour of some other Laws enacted by the Masters, tho' it is always adviseable to keep as close to them as possible; but Reformations are not to be brought about all at once. It may happen that the Nature of certain Subjects proper for moving the Passions, may require a little more Latitude, and then, without Offence to the Criticks sure, there may be room for a saving in Equity from the Severity of the common Law of Parnassus, as well as of the Kings-bench. To sacrifice a principal Beauty, upon which the Success of the whole may depend, is being too strictly tied down; in such a Case, Summum jus, may be Summa injuria. Corneille himself complains of finding his Genius often cramped by his own Rules: âThere is infinite Difference (says he) between Speculation and Practice: Let the severest Critick make the trial, he will be convinc'd by his own Experience, that upon certain Occasions too strict an Adherence to the Letter of the Law, shall exclude a bright Opportunity of shining, or touching the Passions. Where the Breach is of little moment, or can be contrived to be as it were, imperceptible in the Representation, a gentle Dispensation might be allowed.â To those little Freedoms he attributes the Success of his Cyd: But the rigid Legislators of the Academy handled him so roughly for it, that he never durst make the Venture again, nor none who have followed him. Thus pinion'd, the French Muse must always flutter, like a Bird with the Wings cut, incapable of a lofty Flight. The Dialogue of their Tragedies is under the same Constraint as the Construction; not a Discourse, but an Oration; not Speaking, but Declaiming; not free, natural, and easy, as Conversation should be, but precise, set, formal Argumenting, Pro and Con, like Disputants in a School. In Writing, like Dress, is it not possible to be too exact, too starched, and too formal? Pleasing Negligence I have seen: Who ever saw pleasing Formality? In a Word, all Extreams are to be avoided. To be a French Puritan in the Drama, or an English Latitudinarian, is taking different Paths to be both out of the Road. If the British Muse is too unruly, the French is too tame; one wants a Curb, the other a Spur. By pleading for some little Relaxation from the utmost Severity of the Rules, where the Subject may seem to require it, I am not bespeaking any such Indulgence for the present Performance: Tho' the Ancients have left us no Pattern to follow of this Species of Tragedy, I perceive, upon Examination, that I have been attentive to their strictest Lessons. The Unities are religiously observed: The Place is the same, varied only into different Prospects by the Power of Enchantment: All the Incidents fall naturally within the very Time of Representation: The Plot is one principal Action, and of that kind which introduces variety of Turns and Changes, all tending to the same Point: The Ornaments and Decorations are of a Piece with it, so that one could not well subsist without the other: Every Act conludes with some unexpected Revolution: And in the End, Vice is punished, Virtue rewarded, and the Moral is instructive. Rhyme, which I would by no means admit into the Dialogue of graver Tragedy, seems to me the most proper Style for Representations of this Heroick Romantick kind, and best adapted to accompany Musick. The solemn Language of a haughty Tyrant will by no means become a passionate Lover, and tender Sentiments require the softest Colouring. The Theme must govern the Style; every Thought, every Character, every Subject of a different Nature, must speak a different Language. An humble Lover's gentle address to his Mistress would rumble strangely in the Miltonick Dialect; and the soft Harmony of Mr. Waller's Numbers would as ill become the Mouths of Lucifer and Belzebub. The Terrible, and the Tender, must be set to different Notes of Musick. To conclude. This Dramatick Attempt was the first Essay of a very infant Muse, rather as a Task at such Hours as were free from other Exercises, than any way meant for publick Entertainment: But Mr. Betterton having had a casual Sight of it many Years after it was written, begg'd it for the Stage, where it found so favourable a Reception, as to have an uninterrupted Run of at least Forty Days. The Separation of the principal Actors which soon followed; and the Introduction of the Italian Opera, put a Stop to its farther Appearance. Had it been composed at a riper time of Life, the Faults might have been fewer: However, upon revising it now, at so great a Distance of Time, with a cooler Judgment than the first Conceptions of Youth will allow, I cannot absolutely say, Scripsisse pudet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS NAMES. MEN. Celius, a British King, Father to Oriana. Constantius, a Roman Emperor, design'd for Marriage with Oriana.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Curtain rises to a Symphony of all sorts of Instruments of Musick. The Scene represents an Enchanted Grove, adorn'd and beautified with Fountains, Statues, &amp;c. Urganda and Delia performing some solemn Ceremony of Enchantment. A full Stage of Singers and Dancers. Urganda, and Delia. Urganda. Sound, sound, ye Winds the rended Clouds divide, Fright back the Priest, and save a trembling Bride; Assist an injur'd Lover's faithful Love: An injur'd Lover's Cause is worthy Jove. Del. Successful is our Charm: The Temple shakes, The Altar nods, th'astonish'd Priest forsakes The hallow'd Shrine, starts from the Bridegroom's Side, Breaks off the Rites, and leaves the Knot unty'd. Urg. Ye sweet Musicians of the Sky, Hither, hither, hither, fly, fly, And with enchanting Notes all Magick else supply. [Urganda and Delia retire down the Scene, waving their enchanted Rods, as continuing the Ceremony. A full Chorus of Instruments and Voices. Sound the Trumpet, touch the Lute, Strike the Lyre, inspire the Flute; In Harmony, Celestial Harmony, All magick Charms are found; Sound the Trumpet, sound. [Here the Statues leap from their Pedestals, and form variety of Dances. Chorus of Singers after the Dance. Musick so charms, and does so sweetly wound, That ev'ry Sense is ravish'd with the Sound. A Single Voice. When Nymphs are coy, And fly from Joy, The Shepherd takes his Reed, He plays a Tune, She stops as soon, And straight they are agreed. The Battle near, When Cowards fear, The Drum and Trumpet sounds; Their Courage warms, They rush to Arms, And brave a thousand Wounds. Chorus. By Harmony our souls are sway'd; By Harmony the World was made. A Second Dance. Singers again advance. A single Voice When with adoring Looks we gaze On bright Oriana's heavenly Face, In ev'ry Glance, and ev'ry Grace, What is it that we see. But Harmony, Celestial Harmony! Our ravish'd Hearts leap up to meet The Musick of her Eyes, The Musick of her Eyes, And dance around her Feet. Full Chorus of Voices and Instruments, as at first. Sound the Trumpet, touch the Lute. Strike the Lyre, inspire the Flute; In Harmony, Celestial Harmony, All magick Charms are found; Sound the Trumpet, sound. A Third Dance Urganda and Delia come forward. Urg. This Care for Amadis, ye Gods, approve, For what's a Soldier's Recompence but Love? When forc'd from Britain, call'd to distant War, His vanquish'd Heart remain'd a Captive here; Oriana's Eyes that glorious Conquest made, Nor was his Love ungratefully repaid. Del. By Arcabon, like hostile Juno, crost, And like Ãneas driv'n from Coast to Coast, The wand'ring Hero wou'd return too late, Charg'd by Oriana with the Crimes of Fate; Who anxious of Neglect, suspecting Change, Consults her Pride, and meditates Revenge. Urg. Just in the Moment, when Resentment fires, A charming Rival tempts, a rugged King requires: Love yields at last, thus combated by Pride, And she submits to be the Roman's Bride. Del. Did not your Art with timely Charms provide, Oriana were his Wife, and not his Bride. Urg. In ancient Times, ere Chivalry was known The Infant World with Monsters overgrown, Centaurs and Giants, nurst with human Blood, And dire Magicians, an infernal Brood, Vex'd Men and Gods: but most the Fair complain, Of violated Loves, and Lovers slain. To shelter Innocence, and injur'd Right, The Nations all elect some Patron-Knight, Sworn to be true to Love, and Slaves to Fame, And many a valiant Chief enrolls his Name; By shining Marks distinguish'd they appear, And various Orders various Ensigns wear. Bound by strict Oaths, to serve the brightest Eyes, Not more they strive for Glory, than the Prize; While to invite the Toil, the fairest Dame Of Britain is the boldest Champion's Claim. Del. Of all who in this Race of Fame delight, Brave Amadis is own'd the hardy'st Knight. Nor Theseus, nor Alcides, ventur'd more, Nor he so fam'd, who, bath'd in Monster's Gore; Upon his crested Helm the trampled Dragon bore. Urg. Ardan, that black Enchanter, whose dire Arts Enslav'd our Knights, and broke our Virgins Hearts, Met Spear to Spear, his great delivering Hand Slew the Destroyer, and redeem'd the Land; Far from thy Breast all Care and Grief remove, Oriana's thine, by Conquest as by Love. Del. But haughty Arcabon, of Ardan's Blood, And Arcalaus, Foes alike to Good, Gluttons in Murder, wanton to destroy, Their fatal Arts as impiously employ: Heirs to their Brother's Mischiefs, and sworn Foes To Amadis, their Magick they oppose Against his Love and Life. Urg. âWith equal Care, Their Vengeance to prevent, we thus prepare. Behold the Time, when tender Love shall be Nor vext with Doubt, nor prest with Tyranny. The love-sick Hero shall from Camps remove, To reap Reward: The Hero's Pay is Love. The Tasks of Glory painful are, and hard, But ah! how blest, how sweet is the Reward! As she retires, Chorus of all the Voices and Instruments repeat. Sound the Trumpet, touch the Lute, Strike the Lyre, inspire the Flute; In Harmony, Celestial Harmony, All magick Charms are found; Sound the Trumpet, sound SCENE II. The SCENE changes to the Inside of a magnificent Temple. King Celius, and the British Court. Men and Women magnificently dress'd in painted Habits, after the ancient manner. The Priests and Druids in their Solemnities, seeming in Confusion, replacing their Idols, and setting their Altars in order. Thunder and Light'ning. In the mean time Constantius, Oriana, and Corisanda come forward. Const. Lovers consult not Stars, nor search the Skies, But seek their Sentence in their Charmers Eyes. Careless of Thunder from the Clouds that break, My only Omens from your Looks I take; When my Oriana smiles, from thence I date My future Hope; and when she frowns, my Fate. Ori. Cease, Prince, the Anger of the Gods to move 'Tis now become a Crime to mention Love. Our holy Men interpreting the Voice Of Heav'n in Wrath, forewarn th'ill-omen'd Choice. Const. Strange Rules for Constancy your Priests devise, If Love and Hate must vary with your Skies. From such vile Servitude set Reason free; The Gods in ev'ry Circumstance agree To suit our Union, pointing out to me; In this right Hand the Scepter that they place, For me to guide, was meant for you to grace. Thou best and fairest of the beauteous Kind, Accept that Empire which the Gods design'd, And be the charming Mistress of Mankind. Cor. Nuptials of Form, of Int'rest, or of State, Those Seeds of Pride, are fruitful in Debate; Let happy Men for gen'rous Love declare, And choose the gentle Virgin, chaste, and fair: Let Women to superior Fortune born, For naked Virtue, all Temptations scorn; The Charm's immortal to a gallant Mind, If Gratitude cement whom Love has join'd. And Providence, not niggardly, but wise, Here lavishly bestows, and there denies, That by each other's Virtue we may rise. Weak the bare Tie of Man and Wife we find, But Friend and Benefactor always bind. The King advances, followed by Priests and Train. King. Our Priests recover: 'Twas a Holy Cheat; Lead back the Bride, the Ceremonies wait. Ori. What Heav'n forbidsâ King. â'Twas Ign'rance of my Will, Our Priests are better taught: What now is ill, Shall, when I please be good; and none shall dare Preach or expound, but what their King wou'd hear. [Priests bow profoundly low. Ere they interpret, let 'em mark my Nod, My Voice their Thunder, this right Arm their God. [Looking sternly at 'em they bow again as before. Prince take your Bride, Ori. 'Twere impious now to suffer him my Hand. [Refusing her Hand. King. How dar'st thou disobey, when I command? Mind, mind her not, nor be disturb'd at Tears, A counterfeited Qualm of Bridal Fears: You'd see, cou'd you her inward Motions watch, Feigning Delay, she wishes for Dispatch; Into a Womans Meaning wou'd you look, Then read her backward, like a Wizard's Book. Priests, to your Chargeâback to your Office go. [Spoken with a stern, imperious Air. Priests retire, obsequiously bowing, as before. Ori. Th'Obedience that is due, and which I owe, Dread Sir, shall ever be observ'd by me; It is not to dispute your high Decree That thus I kneel, but humbly to implore One Moment's short Suspense; I own your Pow'r And I submit. Grant but this small Delay, And as the Prince decides, Oriana shall obey. Const. I have no Will but what your Eyes ordain, Destin'd to Love, as they are doom'd to reign. King. [Aside] Into what Hands, ye Gods! have ye resign'd Your World? Are these the Masters of Mankind? These supple Romans teach our Women Scorn; I thank ye, Gods, that I'm a Briton born. [To them] Agree these Trifles in a short Debate; No more Delays, I am not us'd to wait. [King Celius retires back into the Temple. Oriana, Constantius, and Corisanda, after a short Pause. Ori. Your Stars and mine have chosen you, to prove The noblest way how gen'rous Men shou'd love; All boast their Flames, but yet no Woman found A Passion, where Self-love was not the Ground. Slaves we are made, by false Pretences caught, The Briton in my Soul disdains the Thought. Const. So much, so tenderly your Slave adores, He has no thought of Happiness, but yours. Ori. Vows may be feign'd, nor shall meer Words prevail, I must have Proofs, but Proofs that cannot fail. By Arms, by Honour, and by all that's dear To Heroes, or expecting Lover's swear. Const. Needs there an Oath? and can Oriana say, Thus I command, and doubt if I'll obey? Ori. Prepare then, Prince, to hear a Secret told, Which Shame wou'd shun, and blushing I unfold, But Danger's pressing, Cowards will grow bold: KnowâthenâI love. Const. [eagerly] Can you command Despair, yet Love confess, And curse with the same Breath with which you bless? Ori. [Disdainfully putting him off.] Mistake me notâthat I do love, is true, But flatter not your self, it is not you. Const. [starting] Forbid it, Gods, recall the fatal Breath Which spoke that Word, the Sound is instant Death. Ori. Too late to be recall'd, or to deny, I own the fatal Truthâif one must die, You are the Judge; say, is it youâor I? A Messenger from the Temple. Mess. The King is much displeas'd at this Delay, Constantius walking about in a passion. Const. And let him wait, while 'tis my Will to stay. Ori. Bear back a gentler Answer: we'll obey. [Exit Messenger. Const. Hence ev'ry Sound that's either soft, or kind; O for a War like that within my Mind! Say, Flatterer, say, ah! fair Deluder, speak, Answer me this, ere yet my Heart shall break; Since thus engag'd, you never cou'd intend Your Love, why was I flatter'd with your Hand? Ori. To what a Father and a King thinks fit, A Daughter and a Subject must submit. Think not from Tyranny that Love can grow; I am a Slave, and you have made me so. Those Chains which Duty hath put on, remove; Slaves may obey, but they can never love. Const. Cruel Oriana, much you wrong my Flame, To think that I could lay so harsh a Claim. Love is a Subject to himself alone, And knows no other Empire but his own; No Ties can bind, which from Constraint arise, Where either's forc'd, all Obligation dies. O fatal Law! requiring to resign The Object lov'd; or hated, keep her mine. Ori. [soothingly] Accuse me not of Hate, with equal Eyes I judge your Merit, and your Virtue prize: Friendship, Esteem, be yours, bereft before Of all my Love, what can I offer more? Your Rival's Image in your Worth I view, And what I lov'd in him, esteem in you; Had your Complaint been first, it might have mov'd; He then had been esteem'd, and you belov'd: Then blame me not, since what decides your Fate, Is that you pleaded last, and came too late. Cor. Hard Fate of Merit! Fortune holds the Scale, And still throws in the Weight that must prevail! Your Rival is not of more Charms possest, A Grain of better Luck has made him blest. Const. [aside] To love and have the Power to possess, And yet resign, can Nature yield to this; Shall Nature, erring from her first Command, Self-Preservation, fall by her own Hand? By her own Act, the Springs of Life destroy, The Principles, and Being of her Joy? Tormenting Thought! Can Nature then approve Blessings obtain'd, by cursing whom we love. Possessing, she is lostârenouncingâIâ Where's then the Doubt?âDie, die, Constantius, die. Honour, and love, ye Tyrants, I obey, Where'er your cruel Call directs my Way; To Shame, to Chains, or to a certain Grave, Lead on, unpitying Guidesâbehold your Slave. Ori. Tho' Love be wanting to relieve your Care, Glory may make amends, with Fame in War; Honour's the noblest Chace, pursue that Game, And recompense the Loss of Love with Fame; If still against such Aids your Love prevails, Yet Absence is a Cure that seldom fails. Const. Tyrannick Honour! what amends canst thou E'er make my Heart, by flattering my Brow? Vain Race of Fame! unless the Conquest prove In search of Beauty, to conclude in Love. Frail Hope of Aids! for Time or Chance to give, That Love, which, spite of Cruelty, can live! From your Disdain, since no Relief I find, I must love absent, whom I love unkind; Tho' Seas divide us, and tho' Mountains part, That fatal Form will ever haunt my Heart. O dire Reverse of Hope, which I endure, From sure possession, to despair as sure! Farewel, Orianaâyet, ere I remove, Can you refuse one Tear to bleeding Love? Ah! no, take heedâturn, turn those Eyes away, The Charm's so strong, I shall for ever stay. Princess, rejoiceâfor your next News shall be, Constantius diesâto set Oriana free. [Exeunt severally. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. The SCENE, a thick wooded Forest, the Trees loaded with military Ensigns and Trophies. A rich Pavilion makes the Point of View at the farther end. Arcalaus, and Arcabon. Arcalaus. Enchantress, sayâwhence such Replies as these? Thou answer'st Love, I speak of Amadis. Arcab. Swiftly he pass'd, and, as in Sport pursu'd The savage Herd, and scower'd thro' the Wood; Tigers and Wolves in vain his Stroke withstand, Cut down, like Poppies, by the Reaper's Hand; Like Mars he look'd, as terrible and strong; Like Jove, majestick; like Apollo, young; With all their Attributes divinely grac'd, And sure their Thunder in his Arm was plac'd. Arcal. Who pass'd? Who look'd? Arcab. âAh! there's the fatal Wound, Which tears my Heart-stringsâbut he shall be found; Yes, ye Infernals, if there's Pow'r in Art, These Arms shall hold him, as he grasps my Heart. Shall I, who can draw down the Moon, and keep The Stars confin'd, enchant the boist'rous Deep? Bid Boreas halt, make Hills and Forests move, Shall Iâ Arcal. âBe made a whining Fool to Love? Suspend these Follies, and let Rage surmount, A Brother's Death requires a strict Account; To-Day, To-Day, perhaps this very Hour, This Moment, now, the Murth'rer's in our Pow'r. Leave Love in Cottages and Cells to reign, With Nymphs obscure, and with the lowly Swain; Who waste their Days and Strength in such short Joys, Are Fools, who barter Life and Fame for Toys. Arcab. They're Fools who preach we waste our Days and Strength, What is a Life, whose only Charm is Length; Give me a Life that's short, and wing'd with Joy, A Life of Love, whose Minutes never cloy: What is an Age in dull Renown drudg'd o'er? One little single Hour of Love is more. An Attendant enters hastily, and whispers Arcalaus. Arcal. See it perform'dâand thou shalt be, Black Minister of Hellâa God to me. [Attendant flies away thro' the Air. He comes, he comes, just ready to be caught. Here Ardan fell, here, on this fatal Spot Our Brother dy'd; here flow'd that precious Gore, The purple Flood, which cries aloud for more: Think on that Image, see him on the ground, His Life and Fame both bury'd in one Wound: Think on the Murtherer, with insulting Pride Tearing the Weapon from his bleeding Side: Oh thinkâ Arcab. What need these bloody Images to move? Revenge I will; and would secure my Love: Why should I of a Frailty shameful be, From which no Mortal yet was ever free? Not fierce Medea, Mistress of our Art, Nor Circe, nor Calypso 'scap'd the Smart. If Hell has Pow'r, both Passions I will please, My Vengeance and my Love shall both have Ease. Lead on, Magician, make Revenge secure, My Hand's as ready, and shall strike as sure. [They go off. Oriana and Corisanda entring from the lower part of the Scene. Ori. Thrice happy they, who thus in silent Groves, From Courts retir'd, possess their peaceful Loves. Of Royal Maids, how wretched is the Fate, Born only to be Victims of the State; Our Hopes, our Wishes, all our Passions ty'd For publick Use; the Slaves of others Pride. Here let us wait th'Event, on which alone Depends my Peace, I tremble till 'tis known. Cor. So generous this Emp'ror's Love does seem, 'Twould justify a Change, to change for him. Ori. Alas! thou know'st not Men, their Oaths, and Arts Of feigning Truth, with Treason in their Hearts. Who now's ador'd, may the next Hour displease, At first their Cure, and after, their Desease. [Flourish of Musick as in the Forest. Cor. Oft we have heard such airy Sounds as these Salute us as we pass. Enter several of Arcalaus Magicians singing and dancing, representing Shepherds, Shepherdesses, and PaÃ¯sans. A Shepherd, singing. Follow ye Nymphs and Shepherds all, Come celebrate the Festival, And merrily sing, and sport, and play, For 'tis Oriana's Nuptial Day. [A Dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses. Then a Shepherdess addressing to Oriana, sings. Queen of Britain, and of Love, Be happy as the Blest above; Graces numberless attend thee, The Gods as many Blessings send thee: Be happy as the Blest above, Queen of Britain, and of Love. A rural Dance of PaÃ¯sans. [Exeunt dancing. Ori. Prepost'rous Nuptials! that fill ev'ry Breast With Joy, but only hers who should be blest. Cor. Sure some Magician keeps his Revels here: Princess retire, there may be Danger near. [Flourish of soft Musick at a distance. Ori. What Danger in such gentle Notes can be? Thou Friend to Love, thrice pow'rful Harmony, I'll follow thee, play onâ Musick's the Balm of Love, it charms Despair, Suspends the Smart, and softens ev'ry Care. [Exeunt down the Scene, following the Musick. Arcalaus enters, with an Attendant, observing them as they walk down into the Forest. Arcal. Finish the rest, and then be free as Air: My Eyes ne'er yet beheld a Form so fair. Happy beyond my Wish, I go to prove At once, the Joys of sweet Revenge and Love. [Walks down the Scene after them. Enter Amadis and Florestan. Ama. Mistake me notânoâAmadis shall die. If she is pleas'd, but not disturb her Joy; Nice Honour still engages to requite False Mistresses, and Friends, with Slight for Slight: But if, like mine, the stubborn Heart retain A wilful Tenderness, the Brave must feign, In private Grief, but with a careless Scorn In publick, seem to triumph, not to mourn. Flor. Hard is the Task, in Love or Grief to feign; When Passion is sincere, it will complain: Doubts which from Rumour rise, you should suspend From evil Tongues what Virtue can defend? In Love, who injures by a rash Distrust, Is the Aggressor, and the first unjust. Ama. If she is true, why all this Nuptial Noise, Still echoing as we pass her guilty Joys? Who to a Woman trusts his Peace of Mind, Trusts a frail Bark, with a tempestuous Wind. Thus to Ulysses, on the Stygian Coast His Fate enquiring, spake Atrides' Ghost; Of all the Plagues with which the World is curst, Of ev'ry Ill, a Woman is the worst; Trust not a Woman.âWell might he advise, Who perish'd by his Wife's Adulteries. Flor. Thus in Despair, what most we love, we wrong, Not Heav'n escapes the impious Atheist's Tongue. Ama. Enticing Crocodiles, whose Tears are Death, Sirens, who murder with enchanting Breath: Like Egypt's Temples, dazling to the Sight, Pompously deck'd, all gaudy, gay, and bright; With glitt'ring Gold, and sparkling Gems they shine, But Apes and Monkies are the Gods within. Flor. My Love attends with Pain, while you pursue This angry Theme;âI have a Mistress too: The faultless Form no secret Stains disgrace, A beauteous Mind unblemish'd as her Face; Not painted and adorn'd to varnish Sin, Without all Angel, all Divine within; By Truth maintaining what by Love she got; A Heav'n without a Cloud, a Sun without a Spot. Ama. [Embracing him] Forgive the Visions of my frantick Brain, Far from the Man I love be all such Pain: By the immortal Gods I swear, my Friend, The Fates to me no greater Joy could send, Than that your Labours meet a prosp'rous End. After so many glorious Toils, that you Have found a Mistress beautiful and true. Oriana and Corisanda, without. Ori. and Cor. Help, help, oh! Heav'ns helpâ Ama. âWhat cries are these? Flor. It seem'd the Call of Beauty in Distress. Of savage Beasts and Men, a monstrous Brood Possess this Landâ Ori. and Cor. âHelp, helpâ Ama. âAgain the Cry's renew'd. Draw both our Swords, and fly with Speed to save; Th'Opprest have a sure Refuge in the Brave. [Exeunt, drawing their Swords. Oriana and Corisanda cross the Stage, pursued by a Party of Arcalaus' Magicians. Ori. and Cor. Help, helpâ Party. Pursue, pursueâ [Florestan crosses the Stage following the Pursuit. Arcalaus fighting and retreating before Amadis. Arcal. Thou run'st upon thy Fate: Mortal forbear, A more than Mortal rules the Regions here. Ama. Think not my Sword shall give the least Reprieve, 'Twere Cruelty to let such Monsters live. [Florestan re-enters retreating before another Party, is seiz'd, disarm'd, and carry'd off. Arcal. Yet pause, and be advis'd; avoid thy Fate; Without thy Life, my Vengeance is compleat: Behold thy Friend born to eternal Chains, Remember Ardan now, and count thy Gains, Ama. Like Ardan's be thy Fate, unpity'd fall: Thus I'll at once revenge, and free them all. [Fight, Arcalaus still retreating. A sudden Sound of Instruments expressing Terror and Horror, with Thunder at the same time. Monsters and DÃ¦mons rise from under the Stage, while others fly down from above, crossing to and fro in Confusion, during which the Stage is darken'd. On a sudden a Flourish of contrary Musick succeeds; the Sky clears and the whole Scene changes to a Delightful Vale, Amadis appearing leaning on his Sword, surrounded by Shepherds and Shepherdesses, who with Songs, Musick and Dances, perform the following Enchantment. To be sung in full Chorus. Love, Creator Love, appear, Attend and hear; Appear, appear, appear. A single Voice. Love, Creator Love, Parent of Heav'n and Earth, Delight of Gods above; To thee all Nature ows her Birth; Love, Creator Love. Another single Voice. All that in ambient Air does move, Or teems on fertile Fields below, Or sparkles in the Skies above, Or does in rolling Waters flow, Spring from the Seeds which thou dost sow, Love, Creator Love. Chorus. Better in Love a Slave to be, Than with the widest Empire free. Dance. Ode to Discord. A single Voice. When Love's away then Discord reigns, The Furies he unchains, Bids Ãolus unbind The Northern Wind, That fetter'd lay in Caves, And root up Trees, and plough the Plains: Old Ocean frets and raves, From their deep Roots the Rocks he tares, Whole Deluges lets fly, That dash against the Sky, And seem to drown the Stars; Th'assaulted Clouds return the Shock, Blue Light'nings singe the Waves, And Thunder rends the Rock. Then Jove usurps his Father's Crown, Instructing Mortals to aspire; The Father would destroy the Son, The Son dethrones the Sire. The Titans, to regain their Right, Prepare to try a second Fight, Briareus arms his hundred Hands, And marches forth the bold Gigantick Bands, Pelion upon Ossa thrown, Steep Olympus they invade, Gods and Giants tumble down, And Mars is foil'd by Encelade. Horror, Confusion, dreadful Ire, Daggers, Poison, Sword and Fire, To execute the destin'd Wrath conspire. The Furies loose their Snaky Rods, And lash both Men and Gods. Chorus repeat the last Stanza. Then Symphony for Love. A single Voice. But when Love bids Discord cease, The jaring Seeds unite in Peace; O the Pleasures past expressing! O the Rapture of Possessing! Melting, dying, heav'n'ly Blessing, O the Rapture of Possessing! Hail to Love, and welcome Joy! Hail to the delicious Boy! In Cyprus first the God was known; Then wand'ring, wand'ring o'er the Main, He in Britannia fixt his Reign, And in Oriana's Eyes his Throne. A full Chorus. Hail to Love, and welcome Joy! Hail to the delicious Boy! See the Sun from Love returning, Love's the Flame in which he's burning. Hail to Love, the softest Pleasure; Love and Beauty reign for ever. Dance. [Then to be sung by a Shepherdess addressing herself to Amadis. Now Mortal prepare, For thy Fate is at hand; Now Mortal prepare, And surrender. For Love shall arise, Whom no Pow'r can withstand, Who rules from the Skies To the Centre. Now Mortal prepare, For thy Fate is at hand; Now Mortal prepare, And surrender. Chorus repeat. Now Mortal prepare, &amp;c. [During the Chorus, Oriana appears rising from under the Stage, repos'd upon a Machine representing a Bed of Flowers. The Chorus ended, she rises, and comes forward. Ori. In what enchanted Regions am I lost? Am I alive? Or wander here a Ghost? Art thou too dead?â [Starting at the Sight of Amadis. Ama. Where-e'r you are, the Realms of Bliss must be; I see my Goddess, and 'tis Heaven to see. [Throwing away his Sword, is seiz'd and bound. Stand off, and give me wayâ Ori. âNo, keep him there, Th'ungrateful Traitor, let him not come near: Convey the Wretch where Sisyphus atones For Crimes enormous, and where Tityus groans, With Robbers, and with Murth'rers let him prove Immortal Painsâfor he has murder'd Love. Ama. Have I done this?â Ori. âBase and perfidious Man! Let me be heard, and answer if you can. Was it your Love, when trembling by your Side I wept, and I implor'd, and almost dy'd, Urging your Stay: Was it your Love that bore Your faithless Vessel from the British Shore? What said I not, upon the fatal Night, When you avow'd your meditated Flight? Was it your Love that prompted you to part, To leave me dying, and to break my Heart? See whom you fled, Inhuman and Ingrate, Repent your Follyâbut repent too late. Ama. Mistaken Princess; by the Stars above, The Pow'rs below, and by immortal Jove! Unwilling and compell'dâ Ori. Unwilling and compell'd! vain, vain Pretence, For base Neglect, and cold Indifference. Was it your Love, when by those Stars above, Those Powr's below, and that immortal Jove, You vow'd, before the first revolving Moon, You would return?âDid you return?âThe Sun Thrice round the circled Globe was seen to move, You neither came, nor sentâwas this your Love? Ama. Thrice has that Sun beheld me on your Coast, By Tempests beaten, and in Shipwrecks lost. Ori. And yet you chose those Perils of the Sea, Of Rocks, and Stormsâor any thingâbut Me. The raging Ocean, and the Winter Wind, Touch'd at my Passion, with my wishes join'd, No Image, but of certain Fate, appear'd, Lets I your Absence, than your Danger, fear'd; In vain they threaten'd, and I sued in vain, More deaf than Storms, more cruel than the Main; No Pray'r, nor gentle Message could prevail To wait a calmer Sky, or softer Gale; You brav'd the Danger, and despis'd the Love, Nor Death could terrify, nor Passion move. Ama. Of our past Lives, the Pleasure, and the Pain, Fixt in my Soul, for ever shall remain; Recall more gently my unhappy State, And charge my Crime, not on my Choice, but Fate: In mortal Breast, sure, Honour never wag'd So dire a War, nor Love more fiercely rag'd: You saw my Torment, and you knew my Heart, 'Twas infamy to stay, 'twas Death to part. Ori. In vain you'd cover, with the Thirst of Fame, And Honours Call, an odious Traitor's Name: Could Honour such vile Perfidy approve? Is it no Honour to be true to Love? O Venus! Parent of the Trojan Race, In Britain too, some Remnants found a Place; From Brute descending in a Line direct, Within these Veins thy fav'rite Blood respect; Mother of Love, by Men and Gods rever'd, Confirm these Vows, and let this Pray'r be heard. The Briton to the Gaul henceforth shall bear Immortal Hatred, and eternal War; Nor League, nor Commerce, let the Nations know, But Seeds of everlasting Discord grow; With Fire and Sword the faithless Race pursue, This Vengeance to my injur'd Love is due: Rise from our Ashes some avenging Hand, To curb their Tyrants, and invade their Land; Waves fight with Waves, and Shores with Shores engage, And let our Sons inherit the same Rage. Ama. Might I be heard one Word in my Defenceâ Ori. No, not a Word. What specious forc'd Pretence Would you invent, to gild a weak Defence? To false Ãneas, when 'twas giv'n by Fate To tread the Paths of Death, and view the Stygian State. Forsaken Dido was the first that stood To strike his Eye, her Bosom bath'd in Blood Fresh from her Wound: Pale Horror and Affright Seiz'd the false Man, confounded at the Sight, Trembling he gaz'd, and some faint Words he spoke, Some Tears he shed, which, with disdainful Look, Unmov'd she heard, and saw, nor heeded more Than the firm Rock, when faithless Tempests roar, With one last Look, his Falseness she upbraids, Then sullenly retires, and seeks eternal Shades. Lead me, O lead me where the bleeding Queen, With just Reproaches loads perfidious Men, Banish'd from Joy, from Empire, and from Light, In Death involve me, and in endless Night, But keepâthat odious Objectâfrom my Sight. [Exit. Enter Arcalaus. Arcal. With her last Words, she sign'd his dying Breath, Convey him straight to Tortures, and to Death. Ama. Let me not perish with a Traitors Name. Naked, unarm'd, and single as I am; Loose this right Handâ Arcal. Hence to his Fate the valiant Boaster bear. [Sinks under the Stage with him. For him, let our infernal Priests prepare Their Knives, their Cords, and Altarsâbut for her Soft Beds, and flow'ry Banks, and fragrant Bow'rs, Musick, and Songs, and all those melting Pow'rs With which Love steals on Hearts, and tunes the Mind To tenderness and Yieldingâ Superior Charms, enchant us to be kind. [Exit. The Act concludes with Dancing.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Arcalaus, and Arcabon, meeting. Arcalaus. Welcome as after Darkness chearful Light, Or to the weary wand'rer downy Night: Smile, smile my Arcabon, for ever smile, And with thy gayest Looks reward my Toil, That sullen Air but ill becomes thee now, See'st thou not glorious Conquest on my Brow? Amadis, Amadisâ Arcab. Dead, or in Chains? Be quick in thy Reply. Arcal. He lives, my Arcabon, but lives to die. The gnawing Vulture, and the restless Wheel, Shall be Delight, to what the Wretch shall feel. Arcab. Goddess of dire Revenge, Erinnys, rise, With Pleasure grace thy Lips, with Joy thy Eyes; Smile like the Queen of Love, and strip the Rocks Of Pearls and Gems, to deck thy jetty Locks; With chearful Tunes disguise thy hollow Throat, And emulate the Lark and Linnet's Note; Let Envy's Self rejoice, Despair be gay, For Rage and Murder shall triumph To-day. Arcal. Arise, O Ardan, from the hollow Womb Of Earth, arise, burst from thy brazen Tomb, Bear witness to the Vengeance we prepare, Rejoice, and rest for ever void of Care. Arcab. Pluto, arise, infernal King, release Thy tortur'd Slaves, and let the Damn'd have Peace, But double all their Pains on Amadis. Arcal. Mourn all ye Heav'ns, above yon azure Plain Let Grief abound, and Lamentation reign, The Thunderer with Tears bedew his Sky, For Amadis, his Champion's doom'd to die. Arcab. Death be my Care; for to compleat his Woe, The Slave shall perish by a Woman's Blow; Thus each by turns shall his dire Vow fulfil, 'Twas thine to vanquish, and 'tis mine to kill. Arcal. So look'd Medea, when her Rival Bride, Upon her nuptial Day, consuming dy'd: O never more let Love disguise a Face By Rage adorn'd with such triumphant Grace. Arcab. In sweet Revenge inferior Joys are lost, And Love lies shipwreck'd on the stormy Coast; Rage rules all other Passions in my Breast, And swelling like a Torrent, drowns the rest. Should this curst Wretch, whom most my Soul abhors, Prove the dear Man whom most my Soul adores, Love should in vain defend him with his Dart, Thro' all his Charms I'd stab him to the Heart. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter Celius, Constantius, Lucius a Roman, and a numerous Attendance of Britons. King. From Contracts sign'd, and Articles agreed, With British Faith it suits not to recede: How may the World interpret such Neglect, And on her Beauty, or her Fame, reflect? Roman, consider well what course you run, Resolve to be my Pris'ner, or my Son. If this sounds rude, then know, we Britons slight Those supple Arts which Foreigners delight, Nor stand on Forms to vindicate our Right. [Exit King and Attendants. Luc. Happy Extremity! now, Prince, be blest, Of all you love, and all you wish possest; No Censure you incur, constrain'd to choose, Possest at once of Pleasure, and Excuse. Const. If for my self alone I would possess, 'Twere sensual Joy, and brutal Happiness. When most we love, embracing and embrac'd, The Particle sublime of Bliss, is plac'd In Raptures that we feel the ravish'd Charmer taste. Oriana, noâtho' certain Death it be, I'll keep my WordâI'll die, or set thee free. Haste, Lucius, haste, sound loud our Trumpets, call Our Guard to Arms, tho' few, they're Romans all. Now tremble, savage King, a Roman Hand Shall ne'er be bound, that can a Sword command. As they go off, re-enter King Celius, attended as before. King. Not to be found! she must, she shall be found; Disperse out Parties, search our Kingdoms round; Follow Constantius, seize him, torture, kill; Traitor! what Vengeance I can have, I will. Well have thy Gods, O Rome! secur'd thy Peace, Planted behind so many Lands and Seas, Or thou should'st feel me, City, in thy Fall, More dreadful than the Samnite, or the Gaul. But to supply and recompense this Want, Hear, O ye Guardians of our Isle, and grant That Wrath may rise, and Strife immortal come Betwixt the Gods of Britain, and of Rome. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Scene changes to a Scene of Tombs and Dungeons, Men and Women chain'd in rows, opposite to one another. In the Front of the Captives, Florestan and Coresanda. A magnificent Monument erected to the Memory of Ardan, with this Inscription in large Letters of Gold: Revenge is vow'd, rest quiet, gentle Shade, The Living shall be restless till 'tis had. A Guard of DÃ¦mons, Plaintive Musick. To be sung by a Captive King. Look down, ye Pow'rs, look down, And cast a pitying Eye Upon a Monarch's Misery. Look down, look down. Avenge, avenge, avenge Affronted Majesty. I who but now on Thrones of Gold, Gave Laws to Kingdoms uncontroul'd, To Empire born, From Empire torn, A wretched Slave, A wretched Slave, Am now of Slaves the Scorn. Alas! the Smiles of Fortune prove As variable as Womens Love. By a Captive Lover. The happiest Mortals once were we, I lov'd Mira, Mira me; Each desirous of the Blessing, Nothing wanting but possessing; I lov'd Mira, Mira me, The happiest Mortals once were we. But since cruel Fates dissever, Torn from Love, and torn for ever, Tortures end me, Death befriend me: Of all Pains, the greatest Pain, Is to love, and love in vain. By a Captive Libertine. Plague us not with idle Stories, Whining Loves, and senseless Glories; What are Lovers, what are Kings? What at best but slavish things. Free I liv'd, as Nature made me, No proud Beauty durst invade me, No rebellious Slaves betray'd me, Free I liv'd, as Nature made me. Each by turns, as Sense inspir'd me, Bacchus, Ceres, Venus, fir'd me; I alone have lost true Pleasure; Freedom is the only Treasure. Chorus of DÃ¦mons. Cease, ye Slaves, your fruitless Grieving, No, no, The Powers below No Pity know; Cease, ye Slaves, your fruitless Grieving. A Dance of DÃ¦mons insulting the Prisoners. Flor. to Cor. To taste of Pain, and yet to gaze on thee, To meet, and yet to mourn, but ill agree. Well may the Brave contend, the Wise contrive, In vain against their Stars the destin'd strive. Cor. So to th'appointed Grove the feather'd Pair Fly chirping on, unmindful of the Snare, Pursuing Love, and wing'd with am'rous Thought, The wanton Couple in one Toil are caught, In the same Cage in mournful Notes complain Of the same Fate, and curse perfidious Man. A Captive. O Heav'ns take pity of our Pains, Death is a milder Fate than Chains. [A Flourish of Instruments of Horror. Arcabon descends in a Chariot drawn thro' the Air by Dragons, guarded by infernal Spirits. She alights and comes forward, arm'd with a Dagger in her Hand. Arcab. Your Vows have reach'd the Gods, your Chains and Breath Have the same Dateâ Prepare for Freedom, for I bring you Death. He who so oft has 'scap'd th'Assaults of Hell, Whom yet no Charms could bind, no Force could quell, By whom so many bold Enchanters fell, Amadis, Amadis, this joyful Day, Your Guardian Deity's himself our Prey. From all their Dungeons let our Captives come, Idle Spectators of their Hero's Doom. [Flourish of loud Instruments of divers sorts. Other Dungeons open, and discover more Captives. Amadis chain'd to an Altar, infernal Priests on each side of him with Knives up-lifted ready for the Sacrifice. [Arcabon advancing hastily to stab him, starts and stops. Arcab. Thou dy'stâWhat strange and what resistless Charm, With secret Force, arrests my lifted Arm? What art thou, who with more than magick Art, Dost make my Hand unfaithful to my Heart? Ama. One, who disdaining Mercy, sues to die; I ask not Life, for Life were Cruelty. Of all the Wretched, search the World around, A more unhappy never can be found; Let loose thy Rage, like an avenging God, Fain wou'd my Soul encumber'd, cast her Load. Arcab. [Aside.] In ev'ry Line and Feature of that Face, The dear Enchanter of my Soul I trace: My Brother! had my Father too been slain, The Blood of my whole Race should plead in vain. The Ties of Nature do but weakly move, The strongest Tie of Nature, is in Love. Ama. O Florestan! I see those Chains with Shame, Which I could not preventâO Stain to Fame! O Honour lost for ever! Theseus fell, But Hercules remain'd unconquer'd still, And freed his FriendâWhat Man cou'd doâI did, Nor was I overpower'd, but betray'd. O my lov'd Friend! with better Grace we stood In Arms repelling Death, wading in Blood To Victories; the manly Limb that trod Firm and erect, beneath a treble Load Of pond'rous Mail, these shameful Bonds disdains, And sinks beneath th'inglorious Weight of Chains. Flor. Where shall the Brave and Good for Refuge run, When to be virtuous, is to be undone? Arcab. He spokeâand ev'ry Accent to my Heart Gave a fresh Wound, and was another Dart: He weeps! but red'ning at the Tears that fall, Is it for these? Be quick, and free them all. Let ev'ry Captive be releas'd from Chains: How is it that I love, if he complains? Hence ev'ry Grief, and ev'ry anxious Care, Mix with the Seas and Winds, breed Tempests there: Strike all your Strings, to joyful Measures move, And ev'ry Voice sound Liberty and Love. [Flourish of all the Musick; the Chains at once fall off from all the Captives, Arcabon frees Amadis herself. Chorus of all the Captives. Liberty! Liberty! A single Voice, Arm, arm, the gen'rous Britons cry, Let us live free, or let us die; Trumpets sounding, Banners flying, Braving Tyrants, Chains defying, Arm, arm, the generous Britons cry, Let us live free, or let us die; Liberty! Liberty! Chorus repeat. Liberty! Liberty! Another single Voice. Happy Isle, all Joys possessing, Clime resembling Heaven above, Freedom 'tis that crowns thy Blessing, Land of Liberty and Love! When thy Nymphs, to cure complaining, Set themselves and Lovers free, In the Blessing of Obtaining, Ah! how sweet is Liberty! Dance of Captives, expressing Joy for Liberty. [Arcabon having freed Amadis, they come forward together; the rest standing in Rows on each side of the Theatre, bowing as they advance. Arcab. When Rage, like mine, makes such a sudden Pause, Methinks 'twere easy to divine the Cause: The dullest Warrior, in a Lady's Face, The secret Meaning of a Blush may trace, When short-breath'd Sighs, and catching Glances, sent From dying Eyes, reveal the kind Intent. Let Glory share, but not possess you whole, Love is the darling Transport of the Soul. Ama. The Lords of Fate, who all our Lots decree, Have destin'd Fame, no other Chance for me; My sullen Stars in that rough Circle move; The Happy only are reserv'd for Love. Arcab. The Stars which you reproach, my Art can force, I can direct them to a kinder Course: Trust to my Charms, the present Time improve, Select and precious are the Hours of Love. Unguarded see the Virgin Treasure stand, Glad of the Theft, to court the Robber's Hand; Honour, his wonted Watch no longer keeps, Seize quickly, Soldier, while the Dragon sleeps. Ama. Enchanting are your Looks, less Magick lies In your Mysterious Art, than in your Eyes; Such melting Language claims a soft Return, Pity the hopeless Flames in which I burn; Fast bound already, and not free to choose, I prize the Blessing fated to refuse. Arcab. [Aside.] Those formal Lovers be for ever curst, Who fetter'd freeborn Love with Honour first, Who thro' fantastick Laws are Virtue's Fools, And against Nature will be Slaves to Rules. [To him.] Your captive Friends have Freedom from this Hour, Rejoice for them, but for thy self much more: Sublimer Blessings are reserv'd for thee, Whom Love invites to be possess'd of me. The shipreck'd Greeks cast on ÃÃ¦a's Shore, With trembling Steps the dubious Coast explore, Who first arrive, in vain for Pity plead, Transform'd to Beasts, a vile and monstrous Breed; But when Ulysses with superiour Mien Approach'd the Throne where sat th'Enchantress Queen, Pleas'd with a Presence that invades her Charms, She takes the bold Advent'rer in her Arms, Up to her Bed she leads the Conqu'ror on, Where he enjoys the Daughter of the Sun. [She leads Amadis out. Florestan and Corisanda, and the released Captives only remain. Florestan and Corisanda run into each other's Arms. Flor. In this enchanting Circle let me be, For ever and for ever bound with thee. Cor. Soul of my Soul, and Charmer of my Heart, From these Embraces let us never part. Flor. Never, O neverâin some safe Retreat, Far from the Noise and Tumults of the Great, Secure and happy on each other's Breast, Within each other's Arms we'll ever rest; Those Eyes shall make my Days serene and bright, These Arms, thus circling round me, bless the Night. [Exeunt Flor. and Cor. [The remaining Captives express their Joy for Liberty by Singing and Dancing. Chorus of all the Captives together. To Fortune give immortal Praise, Fortune deposes, and can raise; Fortune the Captives Chains does break, And brings despairing Exiles back; However low this Hour we fall, One lucky Moment may mend all. The Act concludes with variety of Dances. The End of the Third Act.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Arcabon and Arcalaus. Arcalaus Of Women Tyrants 'tis the common Doom, Each haughtily sets out in Beauty's Bloom, Till late repenting, to redeem the past, You turn abandon'd Prostitutes at last. Arcab. Who Hate declares, is sure of Hate again; Rage begets Rage, Disdain provokes Disdain: Why, why, alas! should Love less mutual prove? Why is not Love return'd with equal Love? Arcal. Blessings when cheap, or certain, we despise; From sure Possession what Desire can rise? Love, like Ambition, dies as 'tis enjoy'd, By Doubt provok'd, by Certainty destroy'd. Arcab. To govern Love, alas! what Woman can? Yet 'tis an easy Province for a Man. Why am I then of Hope abandon'd quite? There is a CureâI'd ask itâif I might. Forgive me, Brother, if I pry too far, I've learnt my Rival is your Pris'ner here; If that be trueâ Arcal. âWhat thence would you infer? [Surlily. Arcab. What but her DeathâWhen Amadis is free; From Hopes of herâthere may be Hope for me. Arcal. Thou Cloud to his bright JunoâFoolâshall he Who has lov'd her, ever descend to thee? Arcab. Much vainer Fool art thouâwhere are those Charms That are to tempt a Princess to thy Arms? Thou Vulcan to Oriana's Mars.â Arcal. âBut yet This Vulcan has that Mars within his Net. Your Counsel comes too late, for 'tis decreed, To make the Woman sure, the Man shall bleed. [Exit surlily. Arcab. First perish thou; Earth, Air, and Seas, and Sky, Confounded in one Heap of Chaos lie, And ev'ry other living Creature die. I burn, I burn; the Storm that's in my Mind Kindles my Heart, like Fires provok'd by Wind: Love and Resentment, Wishes and Disdain, Blow all at once, like Winds that plough the Main. Furies! Alecto! aid my just Design: But if, averse to Mercy, you decline The pious Task, assist me, Pow'rs divine; Just Gods, and thou their King, imperial Jove, Strike whom you please, but save the Man I love. [Exit. SCENE II. [The Scene changes to the Representation of a fine Garden; Oriana sitting pensively in a pleasant Bower towards the lower end of the Scene. Soft Musick playing. Arcalaus enters, addressing himself respectfully to her, she rises; they advance slowly towards the Front of the Stage, seeming in mute Discourse, till the Musick ceases. Arcalaus and Oriana. Arcal. Of Freedom lost, unjustly you complain, Born to command, where-e'er you come you reign; No Fetters here you wear, but others bind, And not a Prison, but an Empire find. Ori. Death I expect, and I desire it too, 'Tis all the Mercy to be wish'd from you. To die, is to be free: Oh let me find A speedy Deathâthat Freedom would be kind. Arcal. Too cruel to suspect such Usage meant, Here is no Death, but what your Eyes present: O may they reign, those Arbiters of Fate, Immortal, as the Loves which they create. We know the Cause of this prepost'rous Grief, And we should pity, were there no Relief: One Lover lost, have you not Millions more? Can you complain of Want, whom all adore? All Hearts are yours; ev'n mine, that fierce and free Ranging at large, disdain'd Captivity, Caught by your Charms, the Savage trembling lies, And prostrate in his Chain, for Mercy dies. Ori. Respect is limited to Pow'r alone, Beauty distress'd, like Kings from Empire thrown, Each Insolent invadesâ How art thou chang'd! ah, wretched Princess! now, When ev'ry Slave that loves, dares tell thee so? Arcal. If I do love, the Fault is in your Eyes, Blame them who wound, and not your Slave who dies: If we may love, then sure we may declare; If we may not, ah! why are you so fair? Who can unmov'd behold that heav'nly Face, Those radiant Eyes, and that resistless Grace? Ori. Pluck out these Eyes, revenge thee on my Face, Tear off my Cheeks, and root up ev'ry Grace, Disfigure, kill me, kill me instantly, Thus may'st thou free thy self at once, and me. Arcal. Such strange Commands 'twere impious to obey, I wou'd revenge my self a gentler way. [Offering to take her Hand she snatches it away disdainfully. Ori. Some Whirlwind bear me from this odious Place, Earth open wide, and bury my Disgrace; Save me, ye Pow'rs, from Violence and Shame, Assist my Virtue, and protect my Fame. Arcal. [Aside.] Love, with Submission, first begins in course, But when that fails, a sure Reserve is Force: The nicest Dames who our Embraces shun, Wait only a Pretenceâand Force is one: She who thro' Frailty yields, Dishonour gains, But she that's forc'd, her Innocence retains: Debtors and Slaves for Favours they bestow, Invading, we are free, and nothing owe. No Ties of Love or Gratitude constrain, But as we like, we leaveâor come again. It shall be so.â [To her.] Since softer Arguments have prov'd so vain, Force is the last, resist it if you can. [He seizes her, she breaks from him. Ori. Helpâhelpâye Gods! Arcal. Who with such Courage can resist Desire, With what a Rage she'll love when Raptures sire! Behold in Chains your vanquish'd Minion lies, And if for nothing but this Scorn, he dies. [Amadis discover'd in Chains. Arcalaus advancing to stab him, Arcabon enters in the Instant and offers to stab Oriana. Arcab. Strike boldly, Murd'rer, strike him to the Ground. While thus my Dagger answers ev'ry Wound. By what new Magick is thy Vengeance charm'd? Trembles thy Hand before a Man unarm'd? Ori. Strike, my Deliv'rer, 'tis a friendly Stroke, I shun thee not, but rather would provoke: Death to the Wretched is an end of Care, But yet, methinks, he might that Victim spare. [Pointing to Amadis. Ama. Burst, burst these Chains, just Gods can you look down, On such Distress, like idle Lookers on? My Soul, till now, no Dangers could affright, But trembles like a Coward's, at this Sight. Arcab. So passionate! but I'll revenge it hereâ Arcal. Hold, Furyâor I strike as homeâforbear.â [Arcabon offering to stab Oriana, Arcalaus does the same to Amadis; both withold their Blow. [Trumpets, Kettle-Drums, and warlike Instruments of all kinds, resound from all parts of the Theatre-Urganda enters hastily with a numerous Train. Arcalaus and Arcabon surpriz'd, retire to the opposite side of the Stage. Urg. To Arms, to Arms, ye Spirits of the Air, Ye Guardians of the Brave, and of the Fair, Leave your bright Mansions, and in Arms appear. [Warlike Musick sounds a Charge; Spirits descend in Clouds; some continue in the Air playing upon Instruments of War, others remain ranged in Order of Battle; others descend upon the Stage, ranging themselves by Amadis, whom Urganda frees, giving him a Sword. Oriana likewise is freed. Arcab. Fly quick, ye DÃ¦mons, from your black Abodes, And try another Combat with the Gods; Blue Fires, and pestilential Fumes arise, And flaming Fountains spout against the Skies; From their broad Roots these Oaks and Cedars tear, Burn like my Love, and rage like my Despair. [Trumpets sound on Arcabon's side, which are answer'd on Urganda's. The Grove appears in an Instant all in a Flame; Fountains from below cast up Fire as in Spouts; a Rain of Fire from above; the Sky darkned; DÃ¦mons range themselves on the Stage by Arcalaus and Arcabon; other DÃ¦mons face Urganda; Spirits in the Air; martial Instruments sounding from all parts of the Theatre; Arcalaus advances before his Party, with his Sword drawn, to Amadis. Arcal. Let Heaven and Hell stand neuter, while we try, On equal Terms, which of us two shall die. [Arcalaus and Amadis engage at the Head of their Parties; a Fight at the same time in the Air, and upon the Stage; all sorts of loud Instruments sounding; Arcalaus falls; the DÃ¦mons, some fly away thro' the Air, others sink under Ground, with horrible Cries. Urg. Sound Tunes of Triumph, all ye Winds, and bear Your Notes aloft, that Heav'n and Earth may hear; And thou, O Sun! shine out serene and gay, And bright, as when the Giants lost the Day. [Tunes of Triumph, the Sky clears, the Grove returns to its first Prospect. A large Ball of Fire representing the Figure of the Sun descends gradually to the Stage; Amadis approaching Oriana respectfully; Arcabon stands sullen and observing. Ama. to Ori. While Amadis Oriana's Love possest, Secure of Empire in that beauteous Breast, Not Jove, the King of Gods, like Amadis was blest. Ori. While to Oriana Amadis was true, Nor wand'ring Flames to distant Climates drew, No Heav'n, but only Love, the pleas'd Oriana knew. Ama. That Heav'n of Love, alas! is mine no more, Braving those Pow'rs by whom she falsely swore; She to Constantius would those Charms resign, If Oaths could bind, that shou'd be only mine. Ori. With a feign'd Falshood you'd evade your Part Of Guilt, and tax a tender faithful Heart: While by such Ways you'd hide a conscious Flame, The only Virtue you have left, is Shame. [Turning disdainfully from him. Ama. [Approaching tenderly.] But shou'd this injur'd Vassal you suspect Prove trueâAh! what Return might he expect? Ori. [Returning to him with an Air of Tenderness.] Tho' brave Constantius charms with ev'ry Art, That can entice a tender Virgin's Heart, Whether he shines for Glory, or Delight, To tempt Ambition, or enchant the Sight, Were Amadis restor'd to my Esteem, I would reject a Deityâfor him. Ama. Tho' false as wat'ry Bubbles blown by Wind, Fixt in my Soul, and rooted in my Mind, I love Oriana, faithless and unkind. O were she kind, and faithful, as she's fair! For her alone I'd liveâand die for her. Urg. Adjourn these Murmurs of returning Love, And from this Scene of Rage and Fate remove. [To Arcabon.] Thy Empire, Arcabon, concludes this Hour, Short is the Date of all flagitious Pow'r: Spar'd be thy Life, that thou may'st living bear The Torments of the damn'd in thy Despair. [To Oriana and Amadis.] Where Zephyrs only breathe in Myrtle Groves, There will I lead you to debate your Loves. [The Machine representing the Figure of the Sun opens and appears to be a Chariot refulgent with Rays, magnificently gilt and adorn'd, with convenient Seats, to which Urganda conducts Oriana; Amadis following, Arcabon stops him by the Robe. Arcab. What, not one Look! not one dissembling Smile, To thank me for your Life? or to beguile Despair? Cold and ungrateful as thou art, Hence from my Sight for ever, and my Heart. [Letting go her hold with an air of Contempt. Back, Soldier, to the Camp, thy proper Sphere, Stick to thy Trade, dull Hero, follow War; Useless to Womenâthou mere Image, meant To raise Desireâand then to disappoint. [Amadis takes his Place in Urganda's Chariot, which rises gradually in the Air, not quite disappearing till the close of Arcabon's Speech. So ready to be goneâBarbarian, stay. He's gone, and Love returns, and Pride gives way. O stay, come backâHorror and Hell! I burn! I rage! I rave! I die!âReturn, return, Eternal Racks my tortur'd Bosom tear, Vultures with endless Pangs are gnawing there, Fury! DistractionâI am all Despair. Burning with Love, may'st thou ne'er aim at Bliss, But Thunder shake thy Limbs, and Light'ning blast thy Kiss, While pale, aghast, a Spectre I stand by, Pleas'd at the Terrors that distract thy Joy? Plague of my Life! thy Impotence shall be A Curse to her, worse than thy Scorn to me. [Exit. Chorus. First Voice. The Battle's done, Our Wars are over, The Battle's done, Let Laurels crown Whom rugged Steel did cover. Second Voice. Let Myrtles too Bring Peace for ever, Let Myrtles too Adorn the Brow, That bent beneath the warlike Beaver. A full Chorus of all the Voices and Instruments. Let Trumpets and Tymbals, Let Atabals and Cymbals, Let Drums and Hautboys give over; But let Flutes, And let Lutes Our Passions excite To gentler Delight, And every Mars be a Lover. Dances, with which the Act concludes. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. SCENE Urganda's Enchanted Palace. The Scenes are adorn'd and diversify'd with the several Representations of the Adventures and Exploits of Heroes and Heroines: A large Piece facing the Front, representing their Apotheosis, or Reception among the Gods. Amadis and Oriana. Oriana. In my Esteem he well deserves a Part, He shares my Praise, but you have all my Heart: When equal Virtues in the Scales are try'd, And Justice against neither can decide; When Judgment, thus perplex'd, suspends the Choice, Fancy must speak, and give the casting Voice: Much to his Love, much to his Merit's due, But pow'rful Inclination was for you. Ama. Thou hast no Equal, a superior Ray Unrival'd as the Light that rules the Day. Should Fame sollicit me with all her Charms, Not blooming Laurels nor victorious Arms Shou'd purchase but a Grain of the Delight, A Moment from the Raptures of this Night. Ori. Wrong not my Virtue, to suppose that I Can grant to Love, what Duty must deny; A Father's Will is wanting, and my Breast Is rul'd by Glory, tho' by Love possest: Rather than be another's, I wou'd die; Nor can be yours, till Duty shall comply. Ama. Hard Rules, which thus the noblest Loves engage, To wait the peevish Humours of old Age! Think not the Lawfulness of Love consists In Parents Wills, or in the Forms of Priests; Such are but licens'd Rapes, which Vengeance draw From Heav'n, howe'er approv'd by human Law. Marriage the happy'st Bond of Love might be, If Hands were only join'd, when Hearts agree. Enter Urganda, Corisanda, Florestan, and Attendants to Urganda. Urg. Here faithful Lovers to sure Joys remove, The soft Retreat of Glory and of Love, By Fate prepar'd, to crown the happy Hours Of mighty Kings, and famous Conquerours: Here, gallant Prince, let all your Labours end; Before, I gave a Mistress; now, a Friend; The greatest Blessings which the Gods can send. [Presenting Florestan. Ama. O Florestan! there was but thus to meet, Thus to embrace, to make my Joys compleat; The Sight of thee does such vast Transports breed, As scarce the Ecstasies of Love exceed. Flor. If beyond Love or Glory is a Taste Of Pleasure, it is sure in Friendship plac'd. Ori. My Corisanda too; [Embracing her. Not Florestan cou'd fly with greater haste To take thee in his ArmsâO welcome to my Breast, As to thy Loversâ Cor. âO Joy compleat! Blest Day! Wherein so many Friends and Lovers meet. Flor. The Storm blown over, so the wanton Doves Shake from their Plumes the Rain, and seek the Groves, Pair their glad Mates, and cooe eternal Loves. Ama. O Florestan! blest as thou dost deserve, To thee the Fates are kind, without Reserve. My Joys are not so full, tho' Love would yield, Fierce Honour stands his ground, and keeps the Field; Nature within seduc'd, in vain befriends, While Honour, with his Guard of Pride, defends: O Nature! frail, and faulty in thy Frame, Fomenting Wishes, Honour must condemn; Or O! too rigid Honour, thus to bind, When Nature prompts, and when Desire is kind. Enter Arcabon conducting Constantius, her Garments loose, and Hair dishevel'd, seeming frantick. Constantius in deep Mourning. Arcab. This, Roman, is the Place: 'Tis Magick Ground, Hid by Enchantment, by Enchantment found. Behold them at our view dissolve in Fear, Two Armies, are two Lovers in Despair; Proceed, be bold, and scorning to entreat, Think all her Strugglings feign'd, her Cries Deceit; Kill him, and ravish herâfor so wou'd I, Were I a Manâor rather let both die. The Rape may pleaseâ Each was disdain'd; to equal Rage resign Thy Heart, and let it burn and blaze like mine. 'Tis sweet to love, but when with Scorn we meet, Revenge supplies the Loss with Joys as great. [A Chariot descends swiftly, into which she enters at the following Lines. Up to th'Etherial Heav'ns where Gods reside, Lo! thus I fly, to thunder on thy side. [A Clap of Thunder. The Chariot mounts in the Air, and vanishes with her. Const. Fly where thou wilt, but not to blest Abodes, For sure, where-e'er thou art, there are no Gods. [Addressing himself to Oriana. I come not here an Object to affright, Or to molest, but add to your Delight. Behold a Prince expiring in your View, Whose Life's a Burthen to himself, and you. Fate and the King all other Means deny To set you free, but that Constantius die. A Roman Arm had play'd a Roman Part, But 'tis prevented by my breaking Heart; I thank ye, Gods, nor think my Doom severe, Resigning Life, on any Terms, for her. Urg. What cruel Destiny on Beauty waits, When on one Face depends so many Fates? Const. Make room, ye Decii, whose devoted Breath Secur'd your Country's Happiness by Death; I come a Sacrifice no less renown'd, The Cause as glorious, and as sure the Wound. O Love! with all thy Sweets let her be blest, Thy Reign be gentle in that beauteous Breast. Tho' thy malignant Beams, with deadly Force, Have scorch'd my Joys, and in their baneful Course Wither'd each Plant, and dry'd up ev'ry Source; Ah! to Oriana shine less fatal bright, Cherish her Heart, and nourish her Delight, Restrain each cruel Influence that destroys, Bless all her Days, and ripen all her Joys. [Oriana weeps, and shews Concern; Amadis addressing himself to Constantius. Ama. Were Fortune us'd to smile upon Desert, Love had been yours, to die had been my Part: Thus Fate divides the Prize; tho' Beauty's mine, Yet Fame, our other Mistress, is more thine. [Const. looking sternly upon him. Disdain not, gallant Prince, a Rival's Praise, Whom your high Worth thus humbles to confess In every thing but Love, he merits less. Const. Art thou that Rival then? O killing Shame! And has he view'd me thus, so weak, so tame? Like a scorn'd Captive prostrate at his Side, To grace his Triumph, and delight his Pride? O 'tis too much! and Nature in Disdain Turns back from Death, and firing ev'ry Vein, Reddens with Rage, and kindless Life again. Be firm, my Soul, quick from this Scene remove, Or Madness else may be too strong for Love. Spent as I am, and wearied with the Weight Of burthening LifeâI could reverse my Fate. Thus plantedâstand thy everlasting Barâ [Seizes him, holding a Dagger at his Breast, Amadis does the same, each holding a Dagger ready to strike. But for Oriana's sake 'tis better here. [Stabs himself; Amadis throws away his Dagger, and supports him; they all help. Ori. Live, gen'rous Prince, such Virtue ne'er should die. Const. I've liv'd enough, of all I wish, possest, If dyingâI may leave Oriana blest. The last warm Drop forsakes my bleeding Heart: Oh Love! how sure a Murderer thou art. [Dies. Ori. [Weeping.] There breaks the noblest Heart that ever burn'd In Flames of Love, for ever to be mourn'd. Ama. Lavish to him, you wrong an equal Flame; Had he been lov'd, my Heart had done the same. Flor. Oh Emperor! all Ages must agree, Such, but more happy, shou'd all Lovers be. Urg. [To Oriana.] No Lover now throughout the World remains, But Amadis, deserving of your Chains. Remove that mournful Object from the Sight. [Carry off the Body. Ere yon bright Beams are shadow'd o'er with Night. The stubborn King shall license your Delight; The Torch, already bright with nuptial Fire, Shall bring you to the Bridegroom you desire; And Honour, which so long has kept in doubt, Be better pleas'd to yield, than to hold out. [Flourish of all the Musick. The Stage fills with Singers and Dancers, in the Habits of Heroes and Heroines. Urganda conducts Amadis, Oriana, &amp;c. to a Seat during the following Entertainment. First Voice. Make room for the Combat, make room; Sound the Trumpet and Drum; A fairer than Venus prepares To encounter a greater than Mars. The Gods of Desire take part in the Fray, And Love sits like Jove, to decide the great Day. Make room for the Combat, make room; Sound the Trumpet and Drum. Second Voice. Give the Word to begin, Let the Combatants in, The Challenger enters all glorious; But Love has decreed Tho' Beauty may bleed, Yet Beauty shall still be victorious. Chorus. Make room for the Combat, make room; Sound the Trumpet and Drum. [Here two parties enter from the opposite sides of the Theatre, arm'd at all Points, marching in warlike order. And then dance several Pyrrick or Martial Dances, with Swords and Bucklers. Which ended, the Singers again advance. To be Sung. Help! help! th'unpractis'd Conqu'ror cries; He faints, he falls; help! help! Ah me! he dies: Gently she tries to raise his Head, And weeps, alas! to think him dead. Sound, sound a Charge,â'tis War again; Again he fights, again is slain; Again, again, help! help! she cries, He faints, he falls, help! help! ah me! he dies. Dance of Heroes and Heroines. Then Singers again come forward. To be Sung. Happy Pair, Free from Care, Enjoy the Blessing Of sweet Possessing; Free from Care, Happy Pair. Love inviting, Souls uniting; Desiring, Expiring; Enjoy the Blessing Of sweet Possessing; Free from Care, Happy Pair. Another Dance of Heroes and Heroines. Then a full Chorus of all the Voices and Instruments. Be true, all ye Lovers, whate'er you endure; Tho' cruel the Pain is, how sweet is the Cure! In the Hour of Possessing, So divine is the Blessing, That one Moment's obtaining, Pays an Age of Complaining. Be true, all ye Lovers, whate'er you endure Tho' cruel the Pain is, how sweet is the Cure! [Here follows variety of Dances, with which the Entertainment concluding. Amadis, Oriana, &amp;c. rise and come forward. Ama. So Phoebus mounts triumphant in the Skies, The Clouds disperse, and gloomy Horror flies; Darkness gives place to the victorious Light, And all around is gay, and all around is bright. Ori. Our present Joys are sweeter for past Pain; To Love and Heav'n, by Suff'ring we attain. Urg. Whate'er the Virtuous and the Just endure, Slow the Reward may be, but always sure. [A Triumphant Flourish of all the Instruments, with which the Play concludes. The End of the Fifth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. By the Right Honourable Joseph Addison, Esq; When Orpheus tun'd his Pipe with pleasing Woe, Rivers forgot to run, and Winds to blow; While list'ning Forests cover'd, as he play'd, The soft Musician in a moving Shade. That this Night's Strains the same Success may find, The Force of Magick is to Beauty join'd: Where sounding Strings, and artful Voices fail, The charming Rod, and mutter'd Spells prevail. Let sage Urganda wave the circling Wand On barren Mountains, or a Waste of Sand, The Desart smiles, the Woods begin to grow, The Birds to warble, and the Springs to flow. The same dull Sights in the same Landskip mixt, Scenes of Still Life, and Points for ever fixt, A tedious Pleasure on the Mind bestow, And pall the Sense with one continu'd Show: But as our two Magicians try their Skill, The Vision varies, tho' the Place stands still; While the same Spot its gaudy Form renews, Shifting the Prospect to a thousand Views. Thus (without Unity of Place transgress'd) Th'Enchanter turns the Critick to a Jest. But howsoe'er to please your wand'ring Eyes. Bright Objects disappear, and brighter rise: There's none can make amends for lost Delight, While from that Circle The Ladies. we divert your Sight.</field>
