      <field name="fulltext">Inter omnes suos laudabiles, &amp; VirtutÃ»m insignibus illustres Viros, non proferunt Romani meliorem; quem neque Felicitas corruperit, nam in tanta VictoriÃ¢, mansit pauperrimus: Nec Infelicitas fregerit, nam ad tantÃ¢ Exitia revertit intrepidus. St. Aust. (de Regulo) Lib. 1. de Civitat. Dei.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable JOHN Earl of Sandwich.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by the Author. You've seen one Patriot, in his Country's Cause Stand forth, and die with her expiring Laws; In CÃ¦sar's Reign he saw great Freedom's Grave, And perish'd with the Rightsâhe cou'd not save: Great is thy Praise, O Cato! great thy Name! And yet to Night we bring an honest Claim, To more than Cato ever did for Fame. 'Tis Regulus appearsâMethinks the Sound Infuses reverential Pleasure round: Methinks I hear amongst this free-born Crowd, The Sons of Liberty cry out aloudâ âGive Regulus the WayâIs't not more great âTo save a Peopleâthan to share their Fate?â Such was the honest Motive of this Man; He for his Country's Glory form'd his Plan, One dy'dâwhen he no longer cou'd be freeâ The otherâto preserve Rome's Liberty: Cato, indignant, spurn'd at CÃ¦sar's Chain, Deserting Lawsâhe cou'd no more maintain;â Ours for the common Cause a Victim stood;â In one 'twas PrideâIn thisâ'twas publick Good. Ye generous Britons judge the Aim of both, And then distinguish the superior Worth. As for the Authorâhither I am come, Not to prevent or deprecate his Doom; To your impartial Judgments he appeals, Let Truth prevail, and Justice fix the Seals: If Merit shines, Merit will make her Claim, And find a Passport to the Realms of Fame; Your Approbation too will swell her Sail, And unforc'd Praise prove a propitious Gale. But if unnerv'd, if spiritless, and mean Appears to you the ill-concerted Scene; Let no false Pity harbour in your Breastâ But damn him for a Warning to the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mrs. Woffington. If one could credit what these Poets tell us, These Greeks and Romans were surprizing Fellows? But when compar'd with Heroes now-a-Days; Who can believe one Word our Author says: To Night fam'd Regulus appear'd before you, Brimful of Honour and his Country's Glory; So fraught with Virtue and with Patriot Zeal, He laid down Life to serve the Publick Weal: Bless me! was ever Man so wildly frantick! We have no Patriots now are so Romantick; We've no State Quixots as they had of Yore; Our Patriots huff, 'tis true, and rant and roar, And talk of this and thatâbut nothing more. Their Ladies too were form'd with strange Ingredients, They lov'd their Husbands, and were all Obedience, And tho' their Mates for many Years wou'd roam, The constant Doves wou'd stay till they came home. Martia, if what they say can gain Belief, For Loss of Husband almost dy'd with Grief; And what is stranger still, they all agree, That Regulus was turn'd of Sixty-three. Wou'd any modern Lady break her Heart, Because an aged Spouse resolves to part? Wou'd she to thwart his Will, be so uncivil? O noâthe Man might go to Carthageâor the Devil, What mighty Stuff compos'd those Sons of Freedom, The Classicks say (I'm told by those who read 'em) That they were Mortals of such wond'rous Merit That e'en when old they fought and lov'd with Spirit. Romans at Sixty-three, as I'm alive, Were better Men than ours at thirty-five. In short, if all that's said and wrote be true, And they when old such mighty Feats cou'd do O Lord! they play'd the Devil sure at twenty-two. Thus far with trifling Jests to please the Age, And to preserve the Custom of the Stage,â But now let serious, nobler Thoughts impart The warmest Wishes to each English Heart; May every Matron, Martia's Truth approve, And every Maid like constant Clelia love, May every Decius find a faithful Friend, And every Corvus meet the Villain's End; May every Briton hold his Country dear, And Truth, not Party, every Action steer; May Regulus's Conduct point the Way, And no false Glitter lead our Youths astray; May every Virtue be transplanted home, And Britain boast the Worth of ancient Rome.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, ROME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Corvus. Carthage inclin'd to Peace?âha! can it be?â What then remains for me, whose bold Design Had plan'd my Greatness on my Country's Ruin, And sold to Carthage, Liberty, and Rome?â Where shall I fly?âwill Carthage take me in, And with surrounding Arms protect my Guilt?â No, she will sooner bosom up a Plague, And with an Insult tell me, that the Wretch, Who sold his native Land, wou'd sell the World: It is the Curse of Treachery like mine, To be most hated, where it most has serv'd. SCENE II. Corvus, Mutius. Corvus. Mutius, what means this;âIs it a Truth I hear?â Does Carthage think of Peace? and will Himilcoâ (O perjur'd faithless Man!) disclaim all Compacts?â Does he refuse my Services for Carthage, And send the Contract back, broken and void?â Curse on all Trustâ Mutius. Why this disjointed Rage?â 'Tis true that Carthage seeks from Rome a Peace; But hear the Motivesâ Corvus. Motives for a Peace? I shall run wild!âCan my Designs prevail By any Motives that conclude a Peace? Am I not ruin'd?âsay, if Rome and Carthage Shake Hands in friendly Parle, and bend to Peace, What must become of me?âNaked I stand The Scorn of one, and Vengeance of the other; Both will deliver me, to Peace a Victim, And sign the Bond of Union in my Blood. Mutius. Corvus, is Carthage yet no better known? Dost thou by first Appearance judge Events? No surer hast thou learn'd to make Distinction Betwixt Necessity and Choice? Thou hast forgot Her rooted Hatred, Altar-vow'd Destruction To Rome and Romans:âIs she not at present Barren of Men, and destitute of Gold: She wants to breathe, and to recover Strength; Then with collected Force pursue Advantage: More sure we strike beneath the Mask of Friendship, Than in an open fair Hostility. Corvus. But wherefore this Delay?âand why, good Mutius, Was I not pre-inform'd?â'Tis general News; No private, no particular Dispatch Has been addressed to me:âCou'd I expect, If Carthage had not shamefully betray'd me, To be almost the last in Rome to hear it? What should I think? Mutius. Not what your Rage suggests: Hear all and then determine:âYour Concern Is with Himilico only, safe with him The trusted Secret lies; had it been lodg'd With the whole Senate, Rome had long since known it: Therefore be calm, Himilco is most just: Sudden was the Resolve, the Causes manyâ The Principal were theseâTheir Coffers empty; Allies fall'n off, revolted Mercenaries; A Battle lately lost; in which, Metellus Has weaken'd their main Strength, and sunk their Hopes: These were strong Calls, such as Himilco's Wisdom Cou'd not but listen toâAs to the Noticeâ They but resolv'd one Day, and sent the next:â Now chide your Rashness. Corvus. Well, but tell me, Mutius, Art thou not charg'd upon this sudden Turn, With some Dispatches from Himilco? Mutius. No; His Hurry, and the Shortness of the Time, Forbad his Writing; to my Memory He therefore trusted what he had to send: His first Injunction was to warn your Care To further this same Peaceâfor, much hung on itâ The Expectation of his Hopes and yours, Many Advantages that ripen slow; And therefore wait the mellowing Warmth of Time; He prays you to be constant, and secure Of him and CarthageâSecret above all, And not to wear the Colour of a Doubt, But that all Compacts shall be ratify'd. Corvus. I thank thee, Mutius; thou hast giv'n me Ease; O what a State is Guiltâhow wild! how wretched! When Apprehension can form nought but Fears, And we distrust Security herself!â But will Rome grant a Peace?âShe must conclude That Carthage wou'd not sue, but her Condition Is weak indeed: Mutius. Therefore with well-aim'd Choice Have they determined on a proper Man To urge their Suit to Rome; one, whose Advice Will with Affection's Ear be listen'd to; And by the Senate made the Voice of Rome. Corvus. What Man? Mutius. I know but oneâ'tis Regulus. Corvus. Damnation! He?âbut 'tis impossibleâ Thou speak'st to feel my Temper:âCou'd Himilco From all Mankind chuse out no other Agent? (My Fury must have Vent) No Man but himâ But Regulus to send?âAnd is he coming? Mutius. I left him onward, and my swiftest Haste Cannot have far out-strip'd him. Corvus. Shame and Death! Thou know'st, and so does he, with what Aversion, What Hatred unappeasable my Soul Has held that Man: Has he not follow'd me With jealous Observation my whole Life? Oppos'd my mounting to the Consul's Chair? Made me obnoxious to the Eye of Rome, Sowing the Seeds of Doubt in every Breast? Consider tooâif he returns to Rome, How are we sure our Practices are secret? Will not his Penetration mar our Schemes? His ever-waking Care, his fix'd Attachment To the romantick Service of his Country, Will shake our Cause with Danger's strongest Blast; I say again, 'twas wrong;â'twas unadvised To send him here; and my divining Soul Anticipates the dreadful Consequence. Mutius. But how cou'd Carthage act in such Distress, But as sh' has done, or follow different Measures? As she requires a Peace, 'tis only Regulus That can secure itânay, his Interest too, His natural Fondness to continue here, Will win him to employ his best Persuasion. Corvus. Carthage again is wrongâshe knows him notâ His Head, ChimÃ¦ra-fill'd, with vain Ideas Of stedfast Honour, and of publick Good, Turns not one Look to Interest or to Safety; If he suspects his Country suffers by it, The smallest Part of Honour or of Land, No Views can bribe him to a Thought of Peace. Mutius. What, not when Life depends on the Success? Hear the Conditionsâe'er he parted thence, In a full Senate he received an Oath, Whose Tenor bound him to return to Carthage, Failing at Rome; and then they told him, Mercy Should be cut off, and Death shou'd be his Doom: But such a Deathâso dreadful and so horrid, That the Thought shudders me; the Racks Extension Is Ease and downy Slumber to the Pains Which they describ'd to him: âIf thou succeed'st not (Such were their Words) âprepare to meet a Torture âMore exquisite than yet Invention practis'd; âThe Bull of Phalaris, Procrustes' Bed, âThat (lopping or extending) fitted all, âWill in Idea wrong what thou shalt feel: âThy Eye-lids torn away, thou shalt be fix'd âAgainst the Glare of the Meridian Sun, âTill thou shalt weep thy Sight away; the Heat âImpregnating the Nerves, shall fire the Brain âAnd whirl consuming Madness; next, rib'd up âNaked within a wooden Round, whose Sides âAre arm'd with Steel inverted, and so thick âThey point sharp Pain almost at ev'ry Pore; âThen from a Mountain's Height, whose broadspread Base âDefies the rough Encounter of the Sea, âThou shalt be roll'd, in circling Agony, âWave-buriedââand to fill up their Description They to his View presented their dire Engine, Their Piece-meal Torture. Corvus. Gave he then no Answer? Mutius. Unmov'd, he view'd it with a careless Eye; Then smil'd, and saidâI'm ready to set forward. Corvus. Contempt of Death;âfor me, I like it notâ The Consequence is fearful, but too late To think of a PreventionâWhat must be done? My private Fears are strong, nor can I shake This heavy Apprehension from my Mind:â But what of Decius?âSay not he is coming; Good Mutius, say my Rival is at Carthage, Detain'd the Hostage of his Friend's Return, And not with Regulus;â Mutius. Your Hopes are vain: Within this half Hour you may see him here. Corvus. Why there againâMisfortune every Way Stares me broad-fac'd; Ruin in ev'ry Shape ApproachesâThere my Love is sacrific'd; Clelia, whom in Despite ev'n of myself, I loveâmust then be hisâthat charming Maid! Nor does it ought avail that I have feign'd The Story of his Death, or she believ'd it;â His curs'd Return will clear all Mysteries, And bring Despair to me:âBut I must hence To make the best Advantage of thy News:â I must conclude on somethingâsee where Quintus, My faithful Slave approaches; him I leave To thy OccasionsâWe must work in Hasteâ Good Mutius, hie thee to Valerius, To him unbosom thy Intelligence: He will conduct thee to him. Mutius. To Valerius? Corvus. To him, good Mutius;âsince thy Absence from us, He has been gain'd to join in our Designs; And is my Colleague, if my present Aim Lights on the Consulshipâby him, at large, Thou shalt be made acquainted with each Step Already taken to complete our Wish: Bid him (as we had Yester-Night appointed) To meet the Tribunes, and excuse my Failing:â I must confer with Scaurus, whom, thou know'st, I long-since plac'd, for Purposes of Moment, In Martia's Family, the Wife of Regulus:â My All is on the HazardâMutius hasteâ And after meet me at the City Gate, E'er Regulus shall enter Rome,âdispatchâ My Fate seems wedded to this Day's Event, And Ruin or Success attends its Close: To Corvus' Mind, the Certainty of either Can feel but lightâ'tis Doubt creates the Pain. SCENE III. Quintus, Mutius. Quintus. Mutius! My Lord!âwhat just return'd from Carthage? How fares my ancient Master?âbrooks he well His lengthen'd Bondage? Mutius. He is now returning. Quintus. Returning, say'st thou?âwherefore this Confusion? Why, fly the Spirits from the Seat of Life? Mutius. Why start'st thou, Quintus? Quintus. Mutius, at thy News, So strange and unexpected. Mutius. He returns, To restore Peace to Carthage and to Rome. Quintus apart. Would he could give it to the Mind of Quintus! Mutius. What say'st thou? Quintus. But a Doubt of his Successâ For Rome is angry at the State of Carthage: Saw you my Lord? Mutius. He parted hence this Moment: Thou Quintus art to bring me to Valerius; With him I must confer. Quintus. I'll shew you to him. SCENE IV. Corvus, Scaurus. Corvus. Hast thou, according to my strict Commands, Us'd thy best Means to sound the Mind of Clelia? To dive into the deep Recess, where Thought Lies working inward; where the Spark Desire, Cloath'd with the Ashes of Indifference, Glows on, and keeps a latent Fire within;â For to that Purpose have I plac'd thee here? Scaurus. I know it well; and my best Diligence Has labour'd to that End:âThe Death of Decius, (Your first Injunction) have I propagated With such Success, that she believes it certain: Nay farther, having gain'd o'er to my Purpose Calva, a Slave attending on her Person; Whose necessary Office sees the Maid Disrob'd of Form; whose trusted Care unlocks The Door of ev'ry Wish, of ev'ry Fear: Her Art has thrown in Doubts and Jealousies Of Decius, while at Carthage; of his Falshood, Other Engagements, and her Love neglected; (Slights which no Woman can with Temper bear) Which his long Silence (for you took right Care To intercept his Letters) seem'd strong Proof of: But all is vain to raze him from her Mind; Nor Falshood nor his Death can yet efface The deep Impression that her Fondness took; Silent and motionless whole Days she sits, Nor cou'd you know her from the Sculptor's Work But for a starting Tear, or bursting Sigh. Corvus. Hast thou not felt her Temper as to me? Scaurus. Oft have I try'd with well-dissembled Soothing To win her to Attention; and have prais'd Your God-like Virtues, and your glorious Deedsâ But most, your Loveâyour fond Regard of her: Abruptly wou'd she stop me in the midst, And say, âI was not sad enough before, âBut you must start this Theme to make me worse:â Sway'd by a strong Dislike she thinks of you! Did I say hateâI should not wrong her Meaning. Corvus. Scaurus, thy well-meant Zeal, thy firm Attachment, Have made it now my Interest to serve thee: I have more Labour for theeâbut more Confidenceâ Th'Account of both shall answer to thy Wish; Be this my Earnest of itâthis assure thee, Thy Welfare is as near me, as the Bosom Which now thou clasp'stâinform her I am here, And wait to tell her News that will surprize her. SCENE V. Corvus. Such is the Fate of Guilt, to make Slaves, Tools, And then to make 'em Mastersâby our Secrets;â But oh! this cruel, this disdainful Fair!â Spite of her rooted Hate she must be mine: But how?âThe Death of Decius?âAyâ'tis fix'd:â She must be borne away too, and made happy Against her Will:âBe not Half-Villain, Corvus; One Hand in Guiltâplunge in its Fellow too, And let both wear the Colour of my Thoughts. See where she comesâCan Love be Weakness call'd, That charms the strongest Passions of the Mind? That subjects Reason to the Tye of Sense, And pulls Ambition from its high-fix'd Seat? SCENE VI. Corvus, Clelia. Corvus. O Clelia! still this Gloom?âmust those bright Eyes Be never seen but in a briny Tear, Or through the half-clos'd Veil of Contemplation? Wilt thou for ever bid Distress attend thee, And listen to no Language but Despair? Clelia. I thought y' had Businessâif you only came To tell me I was wretchedâ'tis a Labour You might have spar'dâfor I have known it long. Corvus. You wrong me muchâI come not to condole, To sooth the anxious Sigh, or soften Pain; An happier Motive sways my present Purpose: I come to banish Sorrow from thy Breast, For ever to dispel the sad'ning Gloom That hangs upon thy Youth, and bring thee Tidings, Such as thy Hope dispair'd of, and thy Heart Will entertain with RaptureâO my Clelia!â Clelia. What mean'st thou, Corvus? Corvus. Regulus returnsâ Clelia. Ye heav'nly Powers! Corvus. To the expecting Arms Of his lov'd Martia; to the joy-shed Tears Of his dear Childrenâand to grateful Rome; To Rome that empties all her Streets to meet him, And with a Triumph crown his wish'd-for Presence. Clelia. Blest he thy happy Tidingsâblest the Bearerâ O Corvus, never did I hear thee speak, With such Delight and Transportâlet me fly, Pour the glad Sounds into my Mother's Ears, And welcome to her Heart the stranger Joy. Corvus. Stay Cleliaâyet thou know'st not half thy Blissâ Not half thy Rapture: Clelia. Wherefore speak'st thou so Can there be added Happiness to what My Father's Coming gives? Corvus. I know there can; Know it with fatal Grief and dear Experience: Hear thenâbut now my Resolution fails meâ I cannot tellâand yet I came to speak itâ To offer up this great Oblation to thee, And be the Grave of all thy Griefs at once. Clelia. I am Amazement all! Corvus. And I Confusionâ O Clelia, tho' my Soul has held thee still Dear as her Hopes of Immortality; Tho' ev'ry Wish was center'd but in theeâ Here I disclaim 'em all, and give thee up My Hope, my Happiness, my Peace of Mind, And in Exchange will welcome thy Despair: Thou wonder'st at my Wordsâ Clelia. And well I may:â Corvus. Thou shalt not longâfor knowâthy Decius livesâ Clelia. What say'st thou? Corvus. Certainâhe returns to Rome, Wing'd with the Transport of beholding thee: Soon shalt thou see him prostrate at thy Feet, Hear his known Voice, and feel his lov'd Embrace. Clelia. Is he not dead?âthou flatter'st Misery:â Is he not dead?âSpeakâease me of my Hope, And make the Tydings certain:â Corvus. 'Tis as certain, As that despairing Corvus must be wretched: O charming Maid!âweigh but my Sufferings justly;â I make no common Sacrificeâ'Tis allâ My treasur'd Hoard of Happiness at onceâ All lavish'd hereâthen, since my cruel Fate, Has from thy Tablet raz'd the Lover's Name, O yet, be just in making some Return, And substitute the Friends. Clelia. O do not doubt; My Gratitude shall never close her Eye, Till she has found Advantage to convince you, That I esteem this Action, as I ought. Corvus. I dare not think of moreâand yetâwho's here? SCENE VII. Decius, Corvus, Clelia. Decius. Forgive th'Abruptness of a Lover's Haste, That thus intrudesâ Clelia. O Decius! Decius. O my Love! I thought I wore thy Image in my Mind Beyond the Painter's Likenessâbut I find, Thou now out-shin'st thy former self as much, As the Meridian Brightness of the Sun Exceeds his Morning Ray. Corvus. Perdition seize him! And add the Pains of Hell to that Embrace! See how she welcomes him to Life, and her With the wild Gaze of unexpected Rapture:â I cannot bear itâ Clelia. Never did I think, O Decius! to behold those Eyes again! Decius. What means my Love?âHa!âwherefore is he here? But that my Faith is strong, my Love secure, And doubt, a Stranger to an Heart like mine: I should suspect the worst by seeing him:â My Clelia speakâ Corvus. Why, Decius, dost thou seem So much alarm'd at me?âwhat can you fearâ Decius. Not the best Vigour of thy Arm in Fight; Not all thy open Manhood can do to me; But when I fearâI fear with honest Men Thy Treachery, thy Arts, thy deep-hid Guile, The Baseness, native of thy gloomy Breast, And every Vice that stains the worst of Men. Corvus. I have been told of Afric's Sun-scorch'd Clime, And find it in thy Railingâ Decius. Let us henceâ The Man so hardy to converse with Guilt, Admits a Parley that may end in Shame. SCENE VIII. Corvus. Curse on his comingâit has ruin'd all!â For his Revilingsâwe were always Foes, Nor shou'd I chuse to hear a kinder Language; Well, since Deceit and Treachery are mine; They shall be both employ'd to dig thy Fall;â Do thou enjoy Distrustâand I Revenge; Yesâhe shall dieâbut while I speak he livesâ It shall be done this NightâSuccess attends Th'uplifted Arm of rapid Execution, While swift Prevention overtakes Delay:â âBut Regulus approachesâI must hence, And meet him with the Mask of Friendship on: Let honest Fools the Boast of Truth enjoy, To look by Nature, and through Passions speak; But Men like me th'inverted Art maintain To weep in Pleasure, and to laugh in Pain. The End of the First ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Corvus, Mutius, meeting. Corvus. Mutius, what Tydings bring'st thou from Valerius? Say, has he met the Tribunes? Mutius. I left him now Conferring with them;âbut they seem as cold, And wear such distant Strangeness in their Looks, As if they knew him not. Corvus. 'Tis what I fear'd:â The curs'd Return of Regulius has chang'd 'em: That Man was born to be the Bane of Corvus, To meet me at each Turn, unwind my Plots, And baffle every Scheme:âbut say, good Mutius, How was his Coming relish'd by Valerius? What said he to the News? Mutius. A deep Surprize Dew'd all his Face, and fix'd his out-stretch'd Eye; His Speech disjointed grew, his Action, wild: But by Degrees the settled Fibres loosen'd, Restoring his first Visageâthen, reminding him The Tribunes waited;âwith a deep-fetch'd Sigh, He cried, I fear his Coming will undo us!â In vain I urg'd the Reasons that calm'd you; He shook his Head, and with a wav'ring Shrug, Irresolute and cold, went forth to meet them. Corvus. Ha! does he doubt? Nay, then I know my Course:â Not to proceed with Warmth is to betrayâ He shall be taken care of. Mutius. Yet his Friendship, So known, and so approv'd, will keep him steddy. Corvus. Friendship?âI have too deeply read Mankind To be amus'd with Friendship; 'tis a Name Invented merely to betray Credulity: 'Tis Intercourse of Interestsânot of Souls, Betwixt the Wise; and when the Fool will deal, He only purchases a Lot of Air, Yet pays his Wife or Fortune for the Bargain. I will this Instant see himâif he faulterâ His Life shall pay the Forfeit of his Fear, And fix the Safety of our Cause: Good Mutius, Here the Arrival wait of Regulus; I will return with Speedâone Moment, seiz'd By quick Advantage, over-rates an Age Of Circumspection and deliberate Thought. SCENE II. Mutius. Friendship but nameâbut an invented Cheat? Where then is fix'd the Basis of our Cause, If there be neither Trust nor Confidence? Ha! where indeed?âI saw it not beforeâ How dreadful is the Prospect!âwhere is Safety When our first Principle avows Destruction? This calls for Thoughtâbut I am interruptedâ [Retires. SCENE III. Decius, Clelia, Mutius. Decius. Truth wou'd be deem'd a Fable, shou'd I speak But half his Baseness: believe me, gentle Clelia, (Tho' the beholding Thee was my best Wish) Yet his ill-omen'd Presence damp'd the Meeting, And pain'd the Pleasure. Clelia. His Pretence to me, Was to inform me of my Father's coming; Of thy Return and Safety:âThese were Tydings Must claim a Welcome from the Heart of Clelia. Decius. No more, my Love;âlet us not waste the Moments, For happier Subjects destin'd, on a Wretch:â Look where his Agent standsâhis black Accomplice:â [Observing Mutius. Do but observe the Face of Villany, How different from the Brow of Innocence! See what a settled Gloom obscures his Visage, Sure Emblem of the Horror of his Breast, Where his false Heart enthron'd in native Darkness (Unconscious and unwishing for the Light) Broods o'er new Treasons, and enjoys the Mischief. Clelia. But look where Martia, where my Mother comes, On Wings of Transport borne to meet her Regulus: See how Affection swells to Extasy, O'er-flowing at the Eyesâwhile every Motion Speaks the unbounded Madness of her Joy, And dresses Pleasure in Distraction's Garb. SCENE IV. Martia, Decius, Clelia, Mutius, Children, Attendants. Martia. Quick, let me flyâwhere is my Regulus?â My LordâMy Love?âO let no Roman Eye Behold my Regulus, till I have seen himâ Till I have pour'd my Transports in his Bosom, And all the Longings of a five Year's Absenceâ An Absence, now o'er-paidâI now forget My Mid-night Watchings, and my flowing Tears, The Dew of every Morn; the constant Care That wrung my Heart, and furrow'd up my Visage:â All is forgotâmy Regulus returns, And Sorrow fades awayâHe comes, he comes, Hark! the glad Crowds proclaim it to the Skies, As if th'important News concern'd the Godsâ As sure it doesâfor what can Jove behold With so much Pleasure, as a virtuous Man, The Image of himselfâO seeâthey comeâ Decius. Retire this Wayâthe circling Croud rolls on, And in the Tumult of their mad'ning Joy, Will over-bear ev'n youâthis Wayâgood Martia, [Retire. SCENE V. Corvus, Mutius, Scaurus, &amp;c. Corvus. What! has he enter'd? Mutius. See he now approaches:â Say, hast thou seen Valerius? Corvus. In right Time, And fix'd his wav'ring Spiritâhe is stedfast: SeeâRegulusâlet us at Distance mark him. SCENE VI. Regulus, Carthaginian Ambassadors, &amp;c. Regulus. Hail Rome and Romans! O thou much-lov'd Land! Whose gentle Bosom bore my Infant Steps; Accept this Tribute of my filial Love: And thou, great Jove, if, with a jealous Eye, Thou seest me pay such Reverence to this Earth, Such almost Idol-Homage to my Countryâ Sure 'tis a Crime the easiest to be pardon'd. Martia. I must have wayâwhere is my Regulus?â My Lordâmy Life.â Regulus. O Martia! O my Wife!â Long let me hold thee here:âMy Children too!â Transport is always silent, and my Words Are lost in more substantial Blissâbut thusâand thusâ Corvus. Curse on his speechless Extasies! Mutius. Be silent. Regulus. At length 'tis past, and Transport gives some Wayâ What shall I first demand, O gentle Martia! Who have a thousand Questions of Importance Waiting to be resolv'd?âBut seeing thee Answers them all, and I am more than happy. Martia. O 'tis an Age since I beheld thee last: What hast thou felt?âand what has Martia suffer'd?â Regulus. No matter what; to bear our Good or Ill With equal Temp'rance is a Roman Virtue:â My Wife!âmy Children!âthus to see ye hereâ O! be the Omen lucky and propitious, That first presents the Objects dearest to me, And teaches me, thro' themâto love my Country. See, Decius, see, thou noble-minded Roman! Whose greatâwhose wondrous, unexampled Friendship Disclaim'd the Charms of native Liberty; And follow'd Regulus to share his Bondage: Behold this Cause for unaccustom'd Joy, And share it with thy Friendâye righteous Gods! A Wife so faithful, and a Friend so true, What can be addedâbut my Country happy?â Mutius. Why stand'st thou musing? join the publick Joy, And hail this Idol. Corvus. Thou instruct'st me, Mutius: Amidst this general Joy for thy Return, Let Corvus pour his Gratulations too, And find 'em welcome. Regulus. Frank Sincerity, Tho' no invited Guest is free to all, And brings his Welcome with him:âSuch I hope Thine, Corvus, isâI'm sure it ought to be: They should not find Deceit, who never meant it. Corvus. Who do not mean Deceit, do not expect it: And your Distinction furnishes a Doubt, A Doubt of meâCan Regulus supposeâ Regulus. No, he disclaims all Rashness: Well he knows That Supposition still out-flies Discretion, And by a giddy Swiftness loses Certainty: If thou art virtuous, let thy Actions speak it; If notâwe have seen Falshoodâev'n in Romans. Corvus. My Test of Honesty and Truth, be Tryal, But, till I forfeit Honour, think I wear it; Nor banish me thy Friendshipâtill unworthy. Regulus. Who lays a Claim to Regulus's Friendship, Must first be Friend to Liberty and Rome: The two firm Rocks on which all Friendships stand, Are Love of Freedom, and our Country's Glory; Piety, Valour, and paternal Love Form the arising Pile: The other Virtues, Candor, Beneficence, and moral Trust, Are Super-structures, and adorn the Dome: Prove thyself Master of so fair a Mansionâ And thou art prov'd my Friend. Corvus. I hope I shall Regulus. There let it restâO Decius!âwhat is Man, When the worst Heart can wear the Brow of Virtue, And false Appearance smile us to Destruction?â And yet, what is he not, when crown'd with Truth, With every social Virtue that thou wear'st?â Then, then, we taste the Rapture of the Gods: SCENE VII. Ãmilius, Lictors, Regulus, &amp;c. Ãmilius. May Jove, Protector of the Roman State, Deck with his whitest Omens this blest Day, That gives to Rome her long-lost Regulus. Th'assembled Fathers of her awful Senate, (Sharing the Joy that enters every Breast) Have, to the Honour of obeying them, Added the Pleasure of my greeting you; And thus to Regulus they bid me say Welcome to Rome and them; more welcome now, Than when a Triumph crowded up her Gates, And the loud PÃ¦an sounded thro' whole Rome, Hailing her Regulus, who fought and conquer'd. In a full Senate they expect his Presence; And that he shou'd not pass the Streets of Rome Less honour'd than when he beheld her last; These Ensigns of the Dignity he wore, These sure Preceders of the Consul's Steps They will him to acceptâand that he'd think 'em Less meant to honour himâthan prove Rome grateful. So Speak the Fathers with united Voice. Regulus. The Speed of this high Honour of the Senate So far out-runs the Prospect of Return, That even Acknowledgment pants breathless after: Yet good Ãmilius, tell the conscript Fathers, When Regulus last parted from these Walls, He was Rome's Consulânot the Slave of Carthage: These Ensigns, that were then his highest Honour, Are now his worst Reproach:âTo fight Ãmilius, In a just Cause, and for our Country's Glory, Is the best Office of the best of Men; And to decline it when those Motives urge, Is Infamy beneath a Coward's Baseness:â'True, I have fought, and conquer'd for my Country, And in the Act of Serviceâpaid myself: But I have fought, and howâZantippus knows, Who, from Rome's Consulâled me Slave to Carthage: Still glows the Brand upon my servile Front, And while the Markâor its Remembrance lives, I am an Alien to such Pomp as this. Say to th'assembled Fathers, that their Love Has over-run their Justice; that these Lictors, Who add true Honours to the Consul's Office, Wou'd wrong themselves, and but disgrace a Slave. Ãmilius. Misfortune does not always wait on Vice; Nor is Success the constant Guest of Virtue: Perhaps the Gods more amiably design, To shew the Hero struggling in the Toils Of unforeseen, unmerited Distress; The great Example beams Instruction forth, And better serves the Purposes of Heav'n: As such consider'dâthou art still the same, As when Success had crested thy Renown, And Valour rested on the Arm of Conquest. Regulus. When Purposes are weigh'd against Events, Say can we promise Certainty or Truth? What I am nowâthe meanest Roman knows, But, what the Gods intendâis theirs alone: Let us not bar their great opposeless Wills, By seeming more than they wou'd have us be: So shall the Chain, that links Propriety, Remain unbroken, and the Nerve of Hope But brace Obedience to the Will of Heaven. First Ambassador. When this Man's Deeds shall reach Posterity, Will they not want a Name to call 'em by? Second Ambassador. And for the Peace that Carthage hopes to gain; Such I perceive his Sway, and Influence;â 'Tis not as Rome resolvesâbut Regulus. Regulus. Let us set forwardâbut without that Trainâ Dismiss 'em, good Ãmilius, or I stir not. [Ãmilius signs to the Lictors, who go off. Martia! My Wife! retire my best-belov'd, And with our Houshold Gods attend my coming: Thou know'st (and always hast approv'd it too) That my first Duty waits upon my Country: The Lover's Ardor, the fond Parent's Care, The Husband's soft Endearments strongly move; But when the Welfare of our Country calls, These Passions setâand the great Patriot shines. [Ex. SCENE VIII. Corvus, Mutius, Scaurus. Corvus. Now, Mutius, we must work with both our Hands, And fashion Business to suppos'd Events: Say that this stern, this Virtue-clouded Man, Repugnant to the Hopes of suing Carthage, Declares against a Peaceâwhat must be done?â Say too, that mindless of the Oath impos'd, He shou'd determine to continue here; And not return to Carthage?âWhere are then Our full-blown Hopes, our ripen'd Expectations? How must we act?âIf we are Friends to Carthage, We must approve it by some bold Attempt, Some noble Deed, where Danger wins Success:â To be secure, we must be bloody, Mutiusâ He must not liveâat all Eventsâhe must not: If he returns to Carthageâthen indeed He will be well dispos'd ofâif he staysâ (The Supposition shakes me)âno, 'tis fix'd If he succeeds for Carthage, still he diesâ Rome cannot hold us bothâMutius, be near meâ I must be now indebted to thy Aid Good Scaurus: Scaurus. I am wholly thine. Corvus. I know it: Repair thou to his House and wait my Orders: Thou art our chief, our Master-Instrument;â We can but shake the Oakâ'tis thou must fell him; The Means are in thy Handsâ Scaurus. Command my utmost Corvus. I thank thee, Scaurusâwe must watch him close: We shou'd not always wait the Throws of Nature: We must be cruel sometimes to be kind, And rip out Safety from the Womb of Time: Propitious Fortune! aid this grand Event; Lend thy Assistanceâto this Birth be kind, And thou, with me, shalt never more be blind. The End of the Second ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Corvus, Mutius. Corvus. Still this tumultuous Noise! this Burst of Joy, Rending the Skies?âO Breath of publick Praise! Short-liv'd and vain! Oft gain'd without Desert, As often lost unmerited: Composed But of Extreams;âthou first begin'st with Love Enthusiastick, Madness of Affection: Then, (Bounding o'er Moderation, and o'er Reason) Thou turn'st to Hate as causeless, and as fierce. Did'st thou behold the Patriot-Cheat proceed, Cheek-flush'd with all the Insolence of Virtue?â Virtue?âPride light up into Zealâa specious Shew, At once himself deceivingâand Mankind:â And in his Way, when he beheld the Temple Sacred to Liberty, he cry'd aloudâ âHere let us sacrifice, my noble Friends, âTo this best Blessing that adorns our Rome: âTo Liberty, that makes our Name rever'd; âTo sacred Libertyâthe Gift of Godsâ âTo Libertyâtheir Gift and their Enjoyment; âWhich, did they wantâthey cou'd not be immortal. He spokeâand with what Violence of Joy, Did the base Crowd applaud!âTheir fever'd Shout Was Liberty and RegulusâI cou'd not bear itâ But breaking thro' the Throng, came here to vent The Spleen and Indignation of my Soul. Mutius. Will you not to the Senate? Corvus. Mutius, I must; My Safety urges:âdidst thou not observe With what a deep Distrust his Eye revil'd me; And when my Salutations reach'd his Ear, What Distance dwelt upon his haughty Brow; Such a contemptuous Length, an Innocence, 'Twixt Guilt and her, still insolently keeps:â Perhaps our Practices have been betray'd;â But how?âby whom?âNoâcertain Carthage wou'd not: I must be thereâAbsence wou'd give Advantage:â It is the Master-piece of Villany To smooth the Brow, and to out-face Suspicion: Again these Shouts?âthey warn us to be gone. SCENE II. The Senate. Manilius. To Jove the Stayer, and the guardian Gods, Protectors of the Roman Liberty, Be paid the Homage of this grateful Senate: Fathers Conscript! why are we thus assembled, Each Roman knows, and knows I hope with Joy. Corvus. Yours is the Task, most venerable Fathers! To lift the fallen, and protect the weak; To make the proud Oppressor feel Oppression, To teach Humanity, and free Mankind: 'Tis yours to seek for Merit thro' the World, To cherish Virtue, and to punish Guilt. This Day a Roman, long rever'd at home, Returns to Rome, again to join our Counsels Let us receive him as his Worth deserves, And as the Gratitude of Rome shou'd speak. SCENE III. The Senate, Regulus, Carthaginian Ambassadors. Manilius. E'er we can listen to the Voice of Carthage, The Senate's Greeting must be first declared: Cou'd Words, O Regulus, express the Joy, The Fullness of our Joy at thy Return; This welcome Office had not then been mine; Then, every Grace that marks the Orator, The Force of Rhetorick, the Flow'rs of Speech, That Athens practis'd, or Minerva taught, Had all been summon'd to perform the Task, And all been baffled in the weak Attempt. Since Oratory failsâlet Truth be heard, And for it's honest Plainess find respect: Come then, Rome's Regulus, and to the Senate (That has with unfeign'd Sorrow mourn'd thy Absence) Give thy accustom'd Presence; mount the Seat, Long vacantâand much longer wou'd remain so, If only equal Merit were to grace it: Come to the Senate's, to the People's Aid, And be once more the Pillar of thy Country. Regulus. Most great, august, and venerable Fathers! Whose awful Virtues strike the World with Wonder; I stand not here Patricianâbut a Slave These, my deputed MastersâWhose Commands Over this Body bear undoubted Swayâ (My Mind tho' still unfetter'd) ifâ First Ambassador. Great Regulus! With Wonder, and with Joy we view thee here; Well pleas'd at thy Return to all thy Honours: We do intreatâ Regulus. I know my Duty better Than to be twice commandedâI obey: [Takes his Seat. Attilius. Say, what wou'd Carthage now? The Senate's Ear Is bent to her Address. First Ambassador. To Rome, grave Fathers! She speaks in Voice less terrible and bold, Than when she wore Defiance on her Brow, And frown'd Destruction on the Roman Land: Too long, she says, has greedy Ravage fed Upon the Vitals both of Rome and Carthage; Too much of Blood has dy'd each other's Fields, And turn'd the Crops of Plenty into Waste: Too oft has Earth re-eccho'd to our Cries, Too often groan'd beneath our Hills of Slain: Ev'n to great Neptune's Empire have we stray'd, And held Contention on his Element; How often has he seen our Fleets engage; Now on a Mountain-surge disputing Conquest; Now grappling close, where the divided Waves, Had form'd a Valley thro' the Storm-plough'd Sea?â Here let the doubtful Tug for Glory end; Divide we here the well-disputed Wreath. Manilius. Long has your Carthage been renown'd for Fraud, The specious seeming, and the deep-hid Guile; Sincerity is not the Growth of Africk, Too hot the Climate for so mild a Fruit: And therefore deem we not this offer'd Peace, As the Result of soft Humanity; The Joy that from another's Good should flow, The Horror to see human-kind laid Waste: Necessity, in spite of the Disguise, Stares out behind, and shews her naked Head. Regulus. Tho' Carthage claims my Body, Conscript Fathers! My greater, nobler Partâis Roman still; My Mind, my Inclinations, and my Hopes, Up-born by Liberty, are still with youâ Then, with a Roman Freedom let me speak: Corvus. 'Tis as I fear'dâcurse on his rigid Virtue! [Apart. Regulus. Fathers! If my Persuasion be of Force, Reject all Terms with Carthage: 'Tis unjust To sink the Spirit of your warlike Legions, In the calm Stillness of ignoble Peace: Check not that Ardor which no Foes can curb, And which in Time must make the World your own: I know the Hardships of a lengthen'd War; What Treasures it must costâwhat Streams of Blood; What vast Expencesâwhat unnumber'd Toils, Equipping Fleets, and mustering Armies ask: But Perseverance is a Roman Virtue, That wins each Godlike Act, and plucks Success Ev'n from the Spear-proof Crest of rugged Danger. First Ambassador. Where will this end? Second Ambassador. Not where our Wishes point. Regulus. Tho' you are weaken'dâlook on Carthage weaker; These Eyes can witness how infirm she is, And how dispirited: She sues for Peace, Because unable to continue War:â Ev'n in her firmest Brace of Fortitude, What cou'd her Arms against the Roman Pow'r? You have been vanquish'd onceâand thenâO Shame! My Rashness gave 'emâwhat they cou'd not win: But brave Metellus has retriev'd that Loss, And more than doubly recompens'd my Failure: Throw LilybÃ¦um, Drepanum asideâ All Sicily is yours:âYour Friends are firm; Theirs doubtfulâveering with the Wind of Interest, Which blows not now from any Port in Africk: Your Armies are compacted of one People, Join'd by the double Tye of Friend and Country, Theirs, Mercenaries only, who are paid For every Blow they strike:âConsider too, Each Day, some brave Allie falls from their Side, Thinking with Horror, how the base Republick Repaid Zantippus, who preserv'd their State. Fathers, a Peace with Carthage carries Shame; Nor lives the Thought in any Breast, I hope, To wrong the Firmness of a Roman Mind, That owns no Passionâbut its Country's Glory. Corvus. Did not the Force of Praise break thro' my Wonder, I had continu'd in this statu'd Senate, Wrap'd up, like them, in silent Admiration, But such disinterested Virtue claims As well our Acclamations as our Wonder. Yet when we weigh th'Importance of a Peace, Against th'Extremities of doubtful War; The long-expected Rest your Legions ask, Against the Turmoils of fatiguing Marches; A certain Safety, 'gainst a certain Dangerâ Perhaps the Scale may then incline to Peace: Carthage is weak, drove to Extremitiesâ But then consider how the desperate Fight;â Despair strikes wildâbut often fatal tooâ And in the mad Encounter wins Success: I do not plead for Peace,âI but remonstrate The State of eachâand then remind you tooâ We can but fightâth' Event is with the Gods. Regulus. Did I not know the Features of the Man Who last address'd you, venerable Fathers; That he was born at Rome, and is Patrician, I had not doubted but that here he stood, Charg'd with th'Affairs of Carthage; that his Speech Had been debated in the Punic Senate, And as a faithful Servant of their State, Deliver'd here by him:âfor cou'd a Roman, At Rome, and in the Roman Senate, Fathers, So far belie the Glory of his Country, To think of Peaceâand with a weaken'd Foe? But, in my former Speech, perhaps I wrong'd The State of Carthage; and she yet has Gold, Whose Influence in our Councils more prevails, Than by the Pay of mercenary Troops: Corvus. Dost thou impeach the Senate's Honesty? And madly sayâ Regulus. Hear first what I wou'd say: Not the whole Senateânor the larger Part;â But some who sit here may have felt that Influence, And you can possibly, best point 'em out; Corvus. Perfidious Carthage!âMutius we're betray'dâ Regulus. How is Rome fallen! Can we forget, my Fathers, When polish'd Cyneas stretch'd the loaded Hand, And the Bribe sparkled in the Matron's Eye;â With what Contempt they view'd the Gift and himâ The vile SeducerâThat was Roman Virtue.â Ye gilded Slaves of Avarice and Pow'r, Who hug, ev'n Bondage, in the Shape of Gold! Look backwards to Dentatus' great Example, Whose best Ambition was to serve his Country; From Pyrrhus' Breast what Honours did he tear! His Armies routed, and himself expell'd, Driv'n like an Out-cast from Italian Land: And when the Senate, for his glorious Deeds, Thinking his Triumph (tho' by far more grand Than e'er reach'd Rome on Wings of Acclamation) Too poor to speak their Gratitude, decreed, That tho' no Roman cou'd possess in Land Above seven Acresâhe shou'd be excepted, And up to fifty swell'd the lavish Grant: Did he accept the Offer of the Senate?â Did he not tell 'emâthat with Justice, Rome Might with a jealous Eye behold that Man, Who aim'd at more Possessions than the rest, And stood the foremost in Distinction's Rank?â If any in this Senate, grasp at Riches, Blush, and be humble from his great Example. Corvus. Had I been conscious of th'imputed Guilt; Or in the constant Progress of my Life, Cou'd recollect one Actâor ev'n one Thought That was not started for the publick Good: Unjustified, I shou'd, with down-cast Eyes, In silent Shame have hid my guilty Head: But, thus erected, I confront the Falshood, And, safe in Innocence, demand a Proof. Regulus. The Proof may comeâbe ready with your Answer:â Other Affairs are now before the Senate. First Ambassador. If not to Peaceâfor Carthage scorns to beg, Nor feels that dire Necessity you speak; At least to Pity bend the Roman Ear: The tender Call of Kindred and of Friends, Should plead successfully to Rome, as Carthage; You hold us base, black with Ingratitude, Yet we first ask to see our native Friends, To taste the Pleasure of a dear Embrace, And hear what Wonders they have seen of Rome: If Peace dislikes youâwe demand not Peace: But let the Longings of so many Romans, Who hope to see their Wives, their Children, Friends, Plead for their just ReleaseâExchange we then; And let the Sons of Carthage and of Rome, Taste the dear Fragrance of their native Fields. Regulus. Till I am certain that a private Good Out-weighs an honest Benefit to all, I must oppose the last Demands of Carthage:â Our Country's Welfare is our first Concern, And who promotes that bestâbest proves his Duty: For Reasons manifold, the publick Welfare Now pleads with me;âand first, the Number, Fathers, Of Carthaginians that wear Chains in Rome, Trebles th'Account of Romans now at Carthage: Some of their best Commanders have we here; The rest, the very Prideâthe Flow'r of Africk, Warm in their Mid-day Blood, active and strong: Our have already offer'd to their Country The Noon-Tide Stream, and now their Ev'ning Drop, Scarce keeps 'em warm in Africk's Sun-parch'd Clime. Fathers, debate no longerâsend us hence; And with Defiance charge these peaceful Heralds: Collect your Legions, and let Carthage feel The just Rewards of Cruelty and Insult. Manilius. What can the Senate answer to thy Worth, All Patriot as thou art?âThy steddy View But thro' one glorious Optick lets in Light; Greatly rejecting all the lesser Ends That point to Fortune, Friends, and Family: Yet Iron-hearted Justice must, I think, (Much more Humanity) at length confess Thou hast out-gone the Precept, and the Teacher Ne'er mean't the rigid Lesson so severe As thou hast in Performance made itâ'tis too muchâ Nor must we lose thy Virtue; thy Example Must teach our wond'ring Youthâ Regulus. To do their Duty. By such an Act of Honesty as this is: I thank the Gods that they have honour'd me To bear their great Commission; to illustrate A Deed resembling their Divinities, Where the first Virtue constitutes the Whole; Fathers, regard not meâAlas! why shou'd you? Think me not worth Exchange; I am, my Fathers, Infirm with Age, and hast'ning to the Place Where Death unites us to Eternity; My Spirits, sunk with Bondage and Oppression, No more can fill me out to Acts of Glory. Let none object the tender Calls of Wife, Of Children, Kindred, and intreating Friends; A Roman has no Property that weighs Against the Good, the Glory of his Country. I do beseech the Senate to concur With my most just Requestâmy virtuous Pray'r! Atilius Regulus. When Marcus Regulus is in the Senate, No kind'red Voice need plead for Liberty: Our honour'd Houseânobly upheld by him, No longer stands, but as he props his Country; Yet thus far let a Kinsman dare to boast, To have at least so much of Regulus, To be the first to follow his Resolves. Regulus. Thou art much more than Kinsmanâthou art Roman. Manilius. To Carthage then;âtell her that Rome rejects All Terms of Peace, and all Exchange of Prisoners: We dare her bloodiest Battle, and we scorn Her Arts, her Baseness, and her Cruelties: We shall return this Messageâbut in Blood, In War deep-dy'd, and hostile Desolation, When we approach her Country: Regulus, Is his own Arbiter; and what he judges Most proper to be doneâis so to us; Let him return, or stayâas he thinks fit. I hope I speak the Judgment of the Senate. [They all rise as assenting. Regulus. Thanks to the Gods!âAnd to your just Resolves. Manilius. Jove the Feretrian, guard the Roman State! And grant that such Examples still may rise, To make Rome blest, and all her Nations happy! The Senate is dissolv'd:â [The Scene closes. Second Ambassador. Most wonderful! Can we believe what we have seen this Day? First Ambassador. 'Tis great indeedâlook what a Brow he wears; How calm and how serene!âhave you determin'd? And will you back with us?â Regulus. Fear not my Conduct: Doubt not but Regulus will act with Honour:â Honour is by the World but ill defin'd, The plighted Oath, or the contracting Word, Strictly maintain'd:âNo, 'tis an heav'nly Light, Impregnating the Soulâsecret it acts, Unconscious of all Motives but its own; Equal to Gods and Men, it forms its Laws, And bears but one Effectâfrom one unalter'd Cause. The End of the Third ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Corvus, Mutius. Corvus. Curse on his steddy Pride! his Stoic Zeal, That heats the Patriot Brain to virtuous Madness; While every Impulse Nature's Instinct urges, Is treated as a distant, spurious Passion, Foreign to Manâwho will himself, amend The great Creator's Work, and tell the Gods, They sent it here imperfectâFuries seize him!â But to our own Concernâfor now we stand Upon a Column, whose Time-eaten Base Hardly supports its burthen'd Capital, That tott'ring overhangs and nods to Ruin. Mutius. 'Tis said, th'Ambassadors will streight return, And with them Regulus; who has requested But two short Hours to take a last Farewel Of his dear Wife, his Children, and his Friends; To settle all Concerns on this Side Lifeâ Then turn from Rome, and from the World together. Corvus. Therefore, I tell thee, I must change my Part: War must be now my Cryâdevoted Regulus Must be the Subject of each Breath of Praise; Higher than all Example must we raise him, And rob the Gods of Attributes to grace him:â But my first Care is to apprise Himilco Of what is done, and what I yet intend: To send by the Ambassadors is slow, It speaks not Warmth and Earnestness enough; It should take Flight upon a Tempest's Wings, And reach the Gates of Carthage in an Hour:â Therefore, good Mutius, thy known Diligence, Will even to Expedition be a Spur, And whip her to the GoalâBe thine this Careâ Fortune and Honours shall repay your Toil:â Quintus, my faithful Slave shall wait upon you, Ready for all Employmentâsee; he's here; SCENE II. Corvus , Mutius, Quintus. Thy Eye speaks Haste:âWhat Tidings bring'st thou, Quintus? Quintus. Such as must give Surprize to every Romanâ The Wife of Regulus has mov'd the Senate With Tears of virtuous Sorrow; at her Instance, They have a solemn Deputation sent; Imploring him to stay in Terms so powerful, That they have bent the Firmness of his Nature:â And now, 'tis said, he will continue here. Corvus. By Hell 'tis false:âSay, Mutius, can it be?â Gods, what a complicated Scene of Doubts This Day has been to me!âIt cannot be. Quintus. Nay more, the Pontifex, to crown the whole, Strengthens the Senate's Pray'r, and has declar'd Him free to stay; and that he neither breaks His Faith to Heav'n, nor Honour to Mankind, If he refuses to return to Carthage: See where he holds him earnest in Discourseâ This Way they move tooâ Corvus. Ha! I fear him now:â Gods! what is all Appearance?âwhat the Truth Of seeming Honesty and Patriot-Zeal, When one short Hour can change the gaudy Scene, Presenting the Reverse?âWe must be speedy, Friends: If he resolves to stayâhe shall not longâ Death can remove himâI'll about the Means:â Quintus. See, now they part;âand Regulus appears Eas'd of the Burthen of conflicting Doubt, And satisfy'd at full. Corvus. What Crowd is that Entring the Gate, that send their Shouts before 'em? Quintus. I cannot guess. Corvus. It is no Matter:âMutius, Do thou the necessary Means prepare Of thy Departure henceâbe speedy, Mutius; E'er on the Dial's Plate, the posting Sun Has measur'd half the Hour, repair to me, And all Things shall be ready:âAt the Gate, That looks toward Carthage, will I wait thy comingâ Fail me not, Mutius. Mutius. I am gone: SCENE III. Quintus. Good Gods! How far I had sail'd into Guilt, before I thought I had left the Shore of Innocence! O wou'd the Gale of Penitence arise And drive me back to SafetyâI were happy! Try, Quintus, what thou can'stâso good a Master! That made his Slaves almost his Children!âha, he comesâ I cannot stayâthe Sight of injur'd Virtue, Strikes deeper than a Poignard to the Guilty: To him I cannot speakâI may to Deciusâ I'll find him out and ease my tortur'd Mind. SCENE IV. Regulus, Attendants. Regulus. O no! it cannot be:âwhat, stay with Honour? Avowing Perjury, to stay with Honour? If Oaths be disregardedâCome Confusion; Come wild Disorder, leading, by the Hand, The Harlot Vice, disfeatur'd of Humanity, And every social GraceâHot Violation, With Harpy-talon'd Rapine, close the Scene, Razing all Virtue from the human Heart:â I must return to Carthage:âWho comes yonder?â Servant. The great Metellus, Sir; our fam'd Pro-Consul, Attended by a Croud of shouting Romans, Just ent'ring Rome. Regulus. 'Tis he by all my Hopes:â It is a timely Meeting;âfor I find My Spirits faintâAs if some unseen Pow'r Had mingled Water with the Stream of Health, And lower'd the rich Juice:âBut see, he comes. SCENE V. Regulus, Metellus, &amp;c. Regulus. O great Metellus! welcome to my Arms! Thou Scourge of Africk, and thou Pride of Rome: I thank thee for my Country, for myself, Her's, and my great AvengerâO methinks! I see thee fighting in Sicilian Fields, With Valour and Discretion on each Side; I see the routed Carthaginians flyâ I see them plunge into the foaming Deepâ (A milder Fate than to encounter thee) While Fear-wing'd Asdrubal forsakes the Field, And hardly reaches LylibÃ¦um's Walls: I swear the bare Imagination fires me; Ev'n Age, long frozen, feels this second Youth, And melts before its artificial Heat. Metellus. Whatever Benefit our Rome has reap'd From that well-meant, that fortunate Exploit, Is doubly grateful, as it was the Means Of seeing Regulus again at Rome: So much, so long I panted for thy Presence;â Believe me, in the Heat of martial Ardor, (Had not the Senate's Orders check'd my Purpose) I had embark'd my Legionsâmarch'd them on, And paid my Greeting in the Streets of Carthage. Regulus. I thank thy generous Love:âA fitter Juncture, I hope will find thee thund'ring at her Gates: Mean time, I can but wish thee to proceed; Do to thy Country yet more Acts of Service, Greater thou can'st not. Metellus. You o'er-rate me much, Unmindful of your own heroick Deeds, My great Examples:âThou hast sure forgotâ Recall thy naval Victory to mind, When Hanno fought, and when Hamilcar fled; Heraclea, scarce recover'd from the Fright, Still stands a Witness of the God-like Action:â Then change the Scene to Africk, and remember With what Rapidity you march'd along From Place to Place:âFame flew before your Arms, And only sounded Regulusâto conquer: An hundred Cities own'd the Roman Swayâ Ev'n Carthageâ Regulus. Stop thee there, Metellus: O spare my Shame, the deep Reproach of Regulus:â And yet repeat itâEvery Son of Rome, Shou'd bear the Memory of that about him, As the best Caution against headlong Rashness: What Glory might I not have gain'd my Country?â What did I lose her in one shameful Day? Metellus. You pass too hard a Censure on yourself: The Gods determine Victoryânot we: Our Rome, unlike to Carthage, better knows Th'Uncertainty of Fortune, than to think, That we should share the Counsel of that Pow'r Who fastens the Event to every Cause: Short-sighted Man, scarce farther sees before him, Than the blind Mole, Tenant of Earth's dark Womb, Who scorns the Beam of Lightâhe can't enjoy. Regulus. And yet this Man, short-sighted as he is, Will, in Presumption's Prospect, plume his Hopes, (Unconscious of the Weakness of his Being) And wing his daring Flight at heav'nly Knowledge; Will arrogate Perfection to himself, And strip the Shrines of Worship to adorn him. Metellus. This Subject better will employ our Leisure; The present Moments are of more Importance: As I was posting hitherward to Rome, I heard of thy Arrival, and resolve Again to leave us to return to Carthage: But wherefore wilt thou go?âThy Country holds thee; Do not with Force irreverent break away!â Thy Country calls theeâO regard her Voice!â Look on thy common Parent, whose white Age Demands thy filial Care to help her Weaknessâ Support herâsave her from th'impending Ruin. Regulus. Alas, Metellus!â'tis thy Friendship's Warmth, And not thy Reason that wou'd keep me here: Look on me shatter'dâcan I help my Country?â Sinking myselfâam I a Prop for her?â Wou'd not the trusted Weight, in crushing me, Precipitate her Fall?âThou art Metellus, Her great Restorer;âthy reviving Hand, Infusing the rich Cordial, lifts her up, And makes her stand alone with youthful Vigour. Go on, Metellus! lead her to the Field, Warm her with Actionâplace her on some Mountain, From whose fair Brow, she may behold her Sons Struggling for ConquestâLet her see thee there, Her youngest, her best lov'd;âev'n in the Heat, The Madness of the Fightâyet cool as Counsel With all the Warmth of Glory at thy Heart.â One Legion, hardly press'd, regains Advantage By Succours timely sent by theeâAnother, Upon the Point of flying, wheels about, And rallies at the Generals not the Trumpet's Voice; Then quick thine Eye pierces far distant, and beholds Where other Dangers callânor call they long: See, reinforc'd they press upon the Foe, And in their Turn, compel 'em into Flight: All their Necessities, like those of Nature, Are scarcely felt before reliev'd;âand though thy Person At the same time can only fill one Spaceâ Thy Careâlike that of Heav'nâis universal. Let her see this, and bless thy happy Birth. Metellus. No more, my Friend; thou speak'st against thyself; Thou, who can'st plan so fair a Draught of Glory; So many speaking Images of Fameâ Can'st yet perform thy Part:âNor is thy Arm, Thy Execution, what we chiefly want; (Tho' great Camillus shew'd what Age cou'd do, Ev'n in Confusion, and in flying Rout.) By nobler Services Success is woo'd By cool Deliberations, well-weigh'd Thoughts, Prevented Accidents, foreseen Advantage, Judgment correct, that only waits upon Gray-hair'd Experience, and slow-teaching Time:â Possess'd of these, Rome still demands thy Care, Still wants her Regulusâstill claims his Counsel. Regulus. It cannot beâPersuasion has no Breath To alter my Resolves;âurge it no more: Death might as soon be mov'd to give again The Child to Life whom the fond Parent weeps for: Therefore no moreâlet us address the Gods, With Roman Piety, and Roman Firmness; Be it our Wish to make ten thousand happyâ One is too poor a Care for noble Minds. Go on, Metellusâleave me to my Fateâ Conquer for Romeâthou'rt follow'd to the Field By shouting Millions, born the Sons of Conquest; Sprung from those god-like Men, whom ev'n when dead The mighty Pyrrhus' self beheld with Fear: He saw their Wounds all honestâall before; The Hand in Death, still clutch'd the faithful Sword, And in the Face, Pain stagnated to Terror. Metellus. But why this strict Adherence to thy Honour With Carthage, noted for her Breach of Faith In private Friendships, and in publick Leagues, The Proverb's Mark and Brand of Perfidy? Is it a Merit to destroy ourselves, And compliment our Foes with Foreign Virtues? (Virtues they never heard ofâor ne'er practis'd) War is allow'd Deceit, its honest Guile, And meritorious Falshoodâshall an Oath An Oath extortedâ Regulus. No 'twas not extorted: It was a Compact betwixt me and Carthage: And mention not her Perfidy, Metellus, With the most savage Foes maintain your Faith. Metellus. Still more I wonder Regulus. Wherefore, good Metellus? Shall I do more than Rome has seen before? When I look backwards, what Examples rise! Did not Posthumius, not an Age ago, To break the Candine Treaty, dedicate Himself and Colleague to the Samnite Foe, When Roman Glory panted for Revenge? Shall Rome degenerate?âand have our Fathers, Done Deeds beyond the Spirit of their Sons! O 'tis a People's deepest Infamy, Poorly to boast the Virtues of their Sires; As if their Worth descended with their Lands, And Fame and Glory were Inheritance. Metellius. Alas! I pity thee; Regulus. And wherefore pity me? The Man who rises above Pain and Death, Laughs at the soft Reproach of Pity's Tear. Ha! Deciusâwhy this Haste?âwhat are thy Tydings?â SCENE VI. Regulus, Metellus, Decius. Metellus. How great! how excellent must Virtue be! If it can make us act like Regulus? Regulus. Decius, I go with thee. Metellus. I see the Time Presses upon thee, and 'tis Interruption Not to be answer'dâto detain thee longer:â Farewell at onceâheroic Regulus! Regulus. Metellus, fare-thee-well; I make no Doubt When that far distant Time that calls thee hence, To put on Immortality, is nigh;â Like mine, thy last of Pray'rsâwill be for Rome;â The Gods protect thee. SCENE VII. Metellus. Pride of Rome, farewell! Thou art above my Praiseâtake all my Wonder: If Honesty of Heart; if Truth unstain'd; The strictest Honour, and the justest Sense, Can, thro' revolving Years perpetuate Fame, The last of Ages shall revere thy Name. SCENE VIII. Corvus. Why comes not this slow Mutius?âhow the Time Loiters in Expectation!âthen the Mind Drags the dead Burthen of an hundred Years In one short Moment's Spaceâthe nimble Heart Beats with impatient Throbsâsick of Delay, And pants to be at Ease:â'tis well thou'rt comeâ SCENE IX. Corvus, Mutius. Corvus. I was accusing theeâsay art thou ready? Is all prepar'd?âQuintus?âsay where is he?â Why comes he not? Mutius. I thought to have found him here: He cannot be long absent;âsure the Time Is scarce expir'dâthou run'st before the Sunâ Are your Dispatches ready? Corvus. Here they are:â If Regulus incline to stay at Rome, He shall not live a Day:âScaurus, my Agent, Whose Care prepares their Baths, has undertaken To give a good Account of him and Decius: Of this I have appriz'd Himilcoâmark, good Mutius:â Inclosed in this lies the concerted Plan Betwixt myself and Colleague, if the Consulship Falls to our Wishes; underneath, the Names Of those, gain'd over lately to our Party, Whose combin'd Interest makes our Purpose look With Eyes of Certainty: The Letter's Tenour Asks the Remittance of some certain Sums, Which Speed must see performed; with an Intreaty To let thy Care convey them:âfor your selfish Men Deal not for Promisesâthey will have Earnest; And Gold is the grand Cement: take 'em, Mutius, Bestow 'em safeâ SCENE X. Corvus, Mutius, Decius, Quintus, Guards. Decius. [Seizing the Pacquet. Not till the Senate sees them: Secure him Romansâ [Seize Mutius. Corvus. Ha! Damnation!âDeciusâ Long have I wish'd thee deadânow to compleat it. [Runs at Decius. Decius. Most impious Villain! [Disarms Corvus. Corvus. Curse upon my Weakness! He come to triumph too?â SCENE XI. Regulus, Corvus, Decius, Mutius, Quintus, &amp;c. Decius. Romans, rejoiceâTreason is brought to Light:â Hail God-like Regulus! receive these Papers, And if thou can'st, peruse the black Contents. Corvus. Ruin and Death!âbut why do I complain? Fear is unmanly, and 'tis vain to hope;â I will despairâ'tis equal, come what mayâ Success were gloriousâthe Attempt was noble. Regulus. If any Guilt can equal thy Design, 'Tis thus to own no Shame at its Detection: What shall I call theeâthere is wanting yetâ (At least in Rome) a Name to do thee Justice: Had'st thou Remorse, thou might'st have look'd about, To find the Comfort of a Fellow-Crime;â But wanting that, thou'rt so supremely wicked, No Punishment they yet have try'd in Hell, Can equal thy Desertâthey must invent one.â And yet this Day thou talk'd of Truth and Honourâ Where are they fled? Corvus. To thy romantick Brain; Where the feign'd Names of Virtue and of Fame, Are wrote on every Tableâshadows all!â Curse on thy moral Precepts!âEvery Good That greets us here, finds Entrance at the Sense: I tell thee, Roman, all your fine Distinctions That call this Man divine, and that a Villain, Are but Religion's Cheatâwhat Sense bestows, Is all we know, and all we can receive. Regulus. What ceaseless Labour must this Man have taken To reach his Height of Guilt?âElaborate Villain?â Each Time thou act'st, and every Time thou speak'st, The more I find thee a Disgrace to Nature: Wou'dst thou destroy the Dignity of Man, And level him with Brutes?âdepose fair Reason, And substitute wild, warring Appetites, Disgracing her mild Sway?âBut thou dost bestâ The Man who dares to act as thou hast done, Is in the right to banish his Reflectionâ Thinking wou'd make him mad. Corvus. What, not yet done? Am I bound up here to be Sentence-baited? To hear thee preach by Rule, and by the Hour? Why stay we here?âhop'st thou to gain a Convert? Prithee be goneâthou wilt but lose thy Labour. Regulus. I do believe theeâDecius bear these Papers, Together with those Wretches to the Senate: Quintus, do thou attend, and to the Fathers, Relate a full Detail of all their Treasons: Look on these Men, and thank the gracious Gods, That thou had'st Honesty enough to leave 'em! Half enter'd in Perdition's darken'd Cell, Praise the kind Pow'r that sent a Ray of Light To shew thee back into the House of Virtue. Corvus. Ha!âQuintus my Betrayer?âbut no matterâ Why shou'd I vainly hope for Truth from others, Who never had that Merit in myself? Had I succeeded in my great Design, I cou'd have wanton'd in the Pains of Hell; To fail is Punishment enough for meâ Worse than ten thousand HellsâPerdition seize thee! SCENE XII. Regulus, Decius. Regulus. Decius, once more commend me to the Senate; Say, while I liv'd, 'twas my extreamest Pray'r, To find out Means to raise the Roman Glory: In my last Scene of Life, I thank the Gods! Their Bounties have thrown out the great Occasion, To leave my Country with an Act of Service: Haste DeciusâI shall wait for thy Return With my lov'd Martiaâhasteâthe Time is shortâ SCENE XIII. Regulus. Alas! what Monsters find we amongst Men; If the great End of Being can be lost, And thus perverted to the worst of Crimes; Let us shake off deprav'd Humanity, Exchange Conditions with the savage Brute, And for his blameless Instinct barter Reason. The End of the Fourth ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Regulus. At length my Course of Duty to my Country Is fairly run; and (thanks to all the Gods) I've reach'd the Goal with some Degree of Honour: Let me then say (I hope without a Boast) I've done what Heav'n requir'd, and what Man ought. My next, last Office, is my own Concern:â My Wife!âMy Children!âO ye upright Gods! Let me not faulter in my noble Purpose: Lend me your Aid, assist me to sustain The Weight that presses on my feebler Part; Let me not feel what Nature is about, Who, soft'ning every Heart-string to her Purpose, Wou'd melt me to the Weakness of a Child:â 'Tis the last Struggleâshrink not Regulus But prove thy Firmness equal to the End. SCENE II. Regulus, Messenger. Regulus. What wou'd thy Message? Messenger. At the City's Gate, Th'Ambassadors of Carthage wait thy Presence. Regulus. I will not long detain 'emâlet 'em know so. SCENE III. Regulus. I must be thrifty of my little Time. SCENE IV. Regulus, Decius, Clelia. Regulus. Decius thou com'st to warn meâfrom the Senate What Message bring'st thou? Decius. Heart-deliver'd Greetings! Such as no Love, no Friendship ever breath'd: The Fervency of Thanks for his Deliverance, When the wreck'd Sailor finds himself on Land Gives but a faint Idea of their Zeal: Nothing is seen or heard throughout the Senate, But Tears and Exclamations:âFor the Traytors, Proofs were so plain, that with a general Voice, The Rock Tarpeian was pronounc'd their Doomâ Which they have leap'd e'er this. Regulus. I thank their Loves; They've given me Strength I wanted:âO my Friend! Long hast thou follow'd with unwearied Steps, My worst of Fortunes, to their present Close; (An uncouth Office for thy gentle Youth) Here shall we part, and all I can bestow Of Happiness, approaches thee in her: Come nearer, CleliaâDecius take her Hand; Unwealth'dâbut not undowr'd; accept a Maid, Whom Virtue will make rich, and Honour great: I know your mutual Loves, and Heav'n prolong it, Ev'n to the latest Moment of your Lives. Decius. On any other but this sad Occasion, This Gift had been too great for common Joy:â This was my utmost Wishâyet at the present 'Tis so embittered with the losing thee, The Sweet is scarcely tastedâO my Father!â Regulus. No more, good Decius!âlet us part like Men:â Keep in thy Tearsâthey are but Nature's Weakness, And the Confession Pain extorts from us, When it wou'd prove the frailty of our Beings: Leave 'em to Womenâthere they look with Graceâ Dimming and adding Lustre to the Eye. Clelia! I have bestow'd thee to thy Wish; Let not thy Wish be Neighbour to Dislike, As some have prov'd it: There are of thy Sex, Who, thro' the Glass of straining Expectation, Look for the Blessing, e'er Enjoyment comes; That overâthen their Prospect is no more, But thro' Satiety's sick Eyeâ Clelia, be thou as constant in the Race, As thou was constant who shou'd start with thee: And so regard your Husband, that you love him, Not for you shou'd obey himâbut obey him, Because you love him:âNote this in thy Heart. Clelia. I hope I shall not profit by my Father So little, not to prove myself his Daughter: My Conduct shall be form'd on such a Plan, That were my Father witness of each Step, He shou'd not find Occasion to disown me. Regulus. 'Tis well resolv'd:âDecius, my Time is shortâ And yet another tender Call invites me, E'er I go hence for everâyet, my Son, I will devote a little of that Time, To leave thee my last Preceptsâmy last Counsel. Decius. Impartâand I will wear 'em in my Heart, Dear as the Memory of him that gave 'em. Regulus. If Rome shou'd raise thee to her highest Service, (As thou hast Merit to expect her Honours) Serve her for Love of Rome, and not of Interest; Let Glory be thy second Motive only, Thy Country's Love be ever first, and dearest: In Liberty's Defence, fight constant, single Die with herâ'tis no Life if you survive her; The greatest Glory of a free-born People, Is to transmit that Freedom to their Children. Search out for hidden Worthâand then reward it: The noblest Prospect to a Roman Eye, Is Greatness, lifting Merit up to Fame. Let Falshood be a Stranger to thy Lips; Shame on the Policy that first began To tamper with the Heart to hide its Thoughts! And double Shame on that inglorious Tongue, That sold its Honesty, and told a Lie! Decius. I hope this Caution is unnecessary: Regulus. I do believe it; but receive it, Decius, Not as a Precept to amend thy Life; But one that cannot be too oft remember'd. Be ready for all Changes in thy Fortune, Be constant when they happenâbut, above all, Mostly distrust good Fortune's soothing Smile; There lurks the Danger, though we least suspect it: Hunt for no Offices;âaccept them offer'dâ But never to the wrong of suffering Merit: Or thy own Virtueâthere may chance a time, When by refusing Honoursâyou most gain 'em. Decius. How shall I fill Rome's Offices with Justice, When thou, my great Instructor art away? What great Example shall direct my Steps, When Regulus is silent and no more? Regulus. Decius, thy Virtue is thy best Instructor She will direct thee right:âbut to proceed If thy paternal Acres be well till'd, Thou hast a Superfluity; for Gold, See it adorn the Temples of the Gods, But banish it your Coffers, and your House: Let the Vain-glorious, or the Villain hoard it, Who loves a Flattererâor who sells his Country:â Be honest Poverty thy boasted Wealth; So shall thy Friendships be sincere, tho' few, So shall thy Sleep be soundâthy Waking chearful. I cou'd say moreâbut, O excuse me, Deciusâ For see where Martia comesâher Sorrows speak Unaided by the Tongueâmore eloquent The Look is in Distressâthan Speech can be: When Sorrow swims in the Tear-flooded Eye, Words need not form a Language for the Heart:â Decius, farewel!âIf my Prediction's true, While Rome has Honours, and neglects thy Service, She will do wrong to Merit and herself. Decius. Farewel, my Father!âO I must retireâ Lest I shou'd shame thy Manhood with my Weakness:â 'Tis not I find to common Natures given To bear Misfortunes like a Regulus. SCENE V. Regulus, Martia, Clelia, two Children. Martia. My Regulus!âmy Love!â First Child. My Father! All. Oh! Regulus. Martia, no more Complaintâwhile yet I stay; While yet a few fond Moments are indulg'd; Let it be spent in Triumphs and Rejoicings,â Not in Condolement and the Voice of Sorrow. Martia. Is this a Time for Triumph or for Joy? This a fit Seasonâ Regulus. Martia, none so fit: When we have spent an honest blameless Life, True to its first Directionâequal all From the first starting to the destin'd Goal,â Say, at the End, is there not Cause for Joy? I thank the Gods, that I set out with Honour, With Honour I come inâmy Country's Glory Was the first Wish that parted from my Heart, And fills up my last Pray'râIs not this Triumph?â Martia! my much-lov'd Martia! share it with me. Martia. Thro' the thick Gloom of a long five Years Absence, Still have I chear'd me with the Twilight Hope; Tho' doubtful thy Returnâstill there was Hope; Tho' captive to thy direst FoesâI still held Hope: Hope was the Anchor that preserv'd my Bark Thro' the rough Fury of a five Years Storm.â But parting now with thatâye Surges dash meâ Split my devoted Sides, and sink me ever! Regulus. Despair is Frenzyâhear me my best Martiaâ Martia. Whatâhear you say that we must part for ever?â Never again indulge, with equal Fondness, O'er these dear Pledges of our mutual Loves?â O Thought of Torture!âCall you this Despair!â Is this Destraction?âNoâor if it be, Reason has made it soâyour boasted Reason, Has only serv'd to make poor Martia mad. Regulus. Martia, no more: The Gods are always just:â And though we never meet again on Earth;â Thou know'st there is a Placeâa destin'd Place, Where Honesty and Virtue shall revive; Where every Sense shall be absorb'd in Thought, The Contemplation of our heav'nly Essence; Where the first Mover shall himself instil Divine Instruction;âwhere uncloy'd we taste The Banquet of the Soul, the Feast of Gods; Where no Misfortune enters, where no Care, Sends forth the anxious Sighâbut all is Peace, Fullness of Pleasure, and eternal Joy. Martia. And do'st thou only lengthen out my Hope, And bid me wait, in Certainty of Pain, For a far distant Ease?âOh! be more kindâ More just, and let me share Misfortune with thee:â I will not meanly wait the Course of Natureâ I will shake off this Loadâthis Life, that holds me From thy lov'd FellowshipâIn Death I'll join thee, Partner in that as well as Lifeâ Regulus. O Martia! An heavy Sorrow weighs thy Senses down; Thou hast forgotâan hundred Offices Which only Time can fill up, claim Attendance; Behold these little Images of Martia, Infected with thy Griefâwhen I am gone, Who shall take care to form their ductile Minds, (Unprincipled as yet in Virtue's School) To shew them Honour's Pathâto turn their Steps From Vices Flow'r-strew'd Way?âSay whose Example, Bettering all Precept, still shall shine before them, The fairest Call to Goodâbut living Martia's? Remembring this great Dutyâcanst thou die? Martia. O my lov'd Regulus?âwhat shall I say? I can with Pleasure dieâto live without thee, Is too severe a Task:âand yet my Childrenâ Regulus. Let them determine thee to treasure Life: Think of their many Wants, and that no Hand Can minister Relief so well as thine:â And, for thy Regulus, still think him here;â I shall be found in every pleasing Prospect: In the chaste Matron's Look, and Virgin's Smile, Thou shalt behold thy Regulusâeach Act, That future Virtues may adorn our Rome with, Shall be a dear Remembrance of my Life:â Nor think thyself a Widowâbe my Fame Thy second Husband: Or if thou inclin'st To grace some noble Roman with thy Person I leave thee Dowry for the best of Menâ Unspotted Truth, and ever-living Honour. Martia. And shall the unpolluted Ermine's White Be soil'd by second Touch? Say shall the Gem, Set in the burnish'd Bullion of thy Worth, Be fix'd in base Allay, and vile Demeritâ No, Regulus: Regulus. Thou art the Glory of thy SexâFarewel!â Keep up thy Constancy of Mind, my Martia! And let us part with manly Resolution; Let not the Woman's Grief break in upon thee, Bear it with unblanch'd Cheek, and Eye unstain'd. Martia. Did'st thou say part?âO where is Resolution?â Where now the stedfast Purpose of my Soul, Which, at thy lov'd Command had arm'd my Heart? Sunk into Tremblings, into Sighs and Tears;â I cannot bear the TryalâO my Husband!â Regulus. Martia rememberâClelia, fare thee well; Advice were needless nowâThou seest thy Motherâ There never was a Virtue, or a Grace Which she possess'd notâwear her in thine Eye, As dearly as the Light that darts upon it: Thou need'st not look abroad for an Exampleâ Thou hast it there:âBe like her and be happy: Farewel my Children! love your virtuous Motherâ Ye will not want a Father by her Care; Observe her Precepts, follow her Advice, Rome will be proud to own ye. Both Children. O my Father!â Regulus. Now my best Martia, take my last Embrace;â Nay this untimely Tenderness unmans meâ Be more yourselfâand hear me say farewel: I leave thee with this TruthâI have not Words To speak thy Worth, nor to describe my Love; Th'Extremity of Grief I feel at parting, Is the best Parallel to reach 'em both:â Farewelâfor everânow adieu the Worldâ Yet, e'er I go, be thou my Witness, Heav'n: That no self-flatt'ring, no vain-glorious Thought, Has urg'd me, to devote myself for Rome: No Hope to live in the World's Memory, The Marble, featur'd into Regulus, The eternizing Brass, inscribing Fame; No, not the Wonder of a future Ageâ No Motive, striking on the Pride of Man, No Ostentation swells within my Purpose, But undistinguish'd Benefit to all, And my first, last great Careâmy Country's Glory. SCENE VI. Martia, Clelia, Children. Martia. Ha! Gone?âfor ever gone?âtoo cruel Regulus! No more at partingâand yet gone for ever? Shou'd he not have return'd, and said once more Farewelâthen afterwards return'd againâ And said again farewellâe'er he went hence for ever? Clelia. My dearest Mother!âI wou'd give you Comfort,â But that I find I want it for myself. Martia. What say'st thou?âComfortâ'tis for Ease and Quiet;â It sleeps upon the Down of sweet Content, In the sound Bed of Industry and Health: It flies the Wretch like meâthe Wretch indeedâ Whom Hope has leftâand in their room, behold Despair and Frenzyâsee they madly join, Whirling consuming Fire thro' all the Brain:â Hail Horrors! hail Destruction! welcome Death! Thou art my Ease, my Comfort, and my Hope:â How is Death alter'd! what a Change is here? Or did the Poet's Fiction do him wrong? Instead of empty Socketsâtwo fair Eyes Inviting with mild Lustre, and his Cheek Fresh with the rosy Bloom of youthful Hebeâ His horrid Grin, chang'd to a pleasing Smile: Come, thou shalt be my GuideâConduct my Steps Where I may find my Regulusâ Second Child. O Sister, speak, and give my Mother Ease, Or teach me how to do it. Martia. Where has my Fancy wander'd?âthe gay Dream, The fond Delusion has forsook me nowâ And I am still aliveâand still most wretched. SCENE VII. Martia, Decius, Clelia, &amp;c. Martia. Ha! Decius!âspeakâsayâwhere is Regulus?â Whatâgone? Decius. Too sure:âI saw him pass the Gate, Where weeping Rome attended;âand oh Martia! How shall Description paint what I beheld?â On Friends that crouded for a last Adieu, Stedfast he gaz'd, and solemnly took leave, Short were is FarewelsâBut advancing farther, Thrice he look'd back, and thrice assay'd to say Farewel my Countryâbut here, rising Sorrow,â (Till now suppress'd) bore down the strong Restraint, And in a Flood of Tears, drown'd all his Speech:â Earnest he gaz'dâand with entreating Eye, And Hands up-lifted, seem'd to pray for Blessings Upon the Roman People:âthen fetching from his Heart, A sadly-pleasing Sighâhe turn'd awayâ And, silently resolv'd, pursu'd his Journey. Martia. Decius!â Decius. Thy Sorrow is too big for Words;â Let us retire and mourn:âMy dearest Clelia! Thou art my Part of Regulus; thy Worth Will be a strong Remembrancer of his, A Mirrour of thy Father's:âEqual Jove! If thy all-judging Pow'r designs for Decius, Ought differing from the Race of common Men; Let it be given to this fervent Pray'r!â Grant me, O Father both of Gods and Men! To love, like Regulus, my native Land, And die, like him, when 'tis her great Command. The End of the Fifth ACT.</field>
