      <field name="fulltext">MARY STUART. A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Mary. Henry. Bothwell. Ormond. Murray.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe palace in Edinburgh.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Mary, Murray. Mur. If thou darest hear the truth, oh queen, I dare To thee express it, since thy faithful people Of this esteem me capable; and since Around the throne there are none who incline, Or dare to speak it. In my breast I bear A flame, not fed by human sympathies, Which, caught from him, aspires to God alone. Ma. Your licence yields no small encouragement (Whether by me indulged, or snatched by you) To popular licence. Your unhallowed schemes, Beneath the sacred shelter of the church, Securely flourish: ye are now detected. But, that it may be manifest that I Hear truth as fearlessly as thou canst speak it, I listen to thee; speak. Mur. It grieveth me That I have not found favour in thy sight; But perhaps I now may serve thee; to do this Will be more meritorious than to please thee. These tears of mine are not dissembled tears: Nor are they prompted by fallacious fear: These tears are representative of those Which all thy people shed, this voice of mine The organ of all hearts.âNow answer me; I, in all Scotland's name, the question ask; Tell me, art thou a widow or a consort? Is he, whom thou thyself hast, by thy side, Placed on the throne, who has the name of king, Is he thy spouse? or enemy, or slave? Ma. Henry a slave, or enemy, to me? How speakest thou? My lover and my spouse My heart accounts him always; but of his Who can affirm the same? Mur. He, far from thee, Can ill appreciate thy genuine thoughts; Thou his still worse. Ma. Who keeps him far from me? 'Tis self-imposed, this exile from the court. How many times have I invited him To return here? Yet erewhile, when I was Reduced by sickness to the brink of death, Did he not only never visit me, But never once sought tidings of my welfare? This was the best reward of my affection; I pass o'er others; and I pass it o'er, That from my vassal I made him your king, And for a long time mine; that for his sake To the most powerful kings of Christendom My right hand I refused;âbut I would fain Confer, and not remember, benefits. Perhaps e'en now the many unjust insults By Henry shewn to me, I might forget, If I beheld in him, on their account, Even the flattery of feigned remorse. Mur. Thy cold reception banished him from thee, The whispers of the court, the audacious looks Of servile satellites, perfidious smiles, Nods, and inquisitorial insolence, And all the arts devised by courtly men To wound, yet cast the wrong upon the wounded; Arts not alone effectual to drive thence A man, distinguished by a monarch's name, But one the most enduring and most passive. Ma. And when each individual of this court, As emulous to win his favour, smiled, Was his deportment different? The torch Of Hymen still for us was here illumed, And I perceived already, that his heart Was, of the throne, and not of me, enamoured. How oft, alas! my lukewarm royal bed I bathed with tears! How oft to heaven complained Of the importuning rank, by which I lost That best of human blessings, the sole good That sheds some sweetness in life's bitter cup, Loving, and being loved! Yet, though exempt From false and overweening self-esteem, I saw myself e'en in the flower of youth, That youth adorned with more than common beauty; I felt myself (and thence had more to give, Than either youth or beauty can impart) With real love inflamed. What gain'd I hence? I bore the cruellest of human insults. Prodigal of my honour, as of his, Rizio he murdered with an impious hand; Eternal blot to both ... Mur. And what? Is that E'en yet by thee remember'd? A vile stranger Raised to supreme command, at once displeased Thy consort, and thy people ... Ma. But should he Have made himself the assassin of that stranger? How could he act so that men might infer That I burned towards him with flagitious love? Just God, thou know'st it well!âTo me was Rizio A faithful counsellor, profoundly skill'd In all the various characters of men, A minister expert: and by his means I steered securely 'mid conflicting parties: Vain, by his means, were the perfidious snares, So oft repeated, of Elizabeth, My bitter, indefatigable foe: Lastly, by his means, Henry, with my hand, My sceptre gain'd. Nor did he feel contempt, Proud as he was, and crafty in his pride, For the vile stranger, while he saw in him The instrument by which he was to gain The distant crown. He gain'd it: and from him What recompense did Rizio thence receive? Amidst the quiet shades of night, beneath My royal roof, 'mid hospitable rites, The sacred confidence of privacy, 'Midst helpless ladies, and before my eyes, Bearing within my womb the first dear pledge Of our unhappy loves, he comes by stealth For trait'rous purposes, and dares defile, With blood, as guiltless as it was ignoble, My table, my apartment, and my dress, Nay e'en my person, and what's more, my fame. Mur. Rizio was raised unduly. To a king, Can any circumstance be more offensive, Than to derive his honours from a subject? He who once gave might take away the throne; And he who thus might take it, is by kings Hated and slain. But yet, to thy revenge Henry surrendered his accomplices: With blood, methinks, for blood thou mad'st atonement.â I come not here to speak in Henry's praise: He is inferior to the throne; who knows Not this? But I come hither to remind thee That he's thy consort; that from him there springs The sceptre's only heir. On you reverts A heavy scandal from your private jars; And we are menaced with impending danger. 'Tis said, that he returns to-day: ere this He hath returned; but evermore from hence, More gloomy hath retired, and afterwards A deeper sadness hover'd o'er thy palace. Let him not come in vain to-day, I pray thee: Enough, too many jarring elements This realm contains within itself. I see Religion, by a thousand different sects Trodden to earth, profess'd and disobey'd. The consummation of our woes would he Royal dissention; ah, avert it, queen! Without the poison of a flattering tongue, From a sincere heart, fervently I speak. Ma. I trust to thy professions: but enough. Now the first audience ought I soon to give To the ambassador from England.âGoâ Leave me:âKnow thou, and say it, if thou wilt, To all my people, that, of my good fame, I live not so regardless, as to need That others now remind me of my duty. That which by love of truth thou art compelled To say to me, do thou repeat to Henry, To whom 'twere more adapted. If he can, Let him, without resentment, or alarm, This thy free language hear, to which, in proof Of an offenceless conscience, I have listened. SCENE THE SECOND. Mary. Ma. Ye lying demagogues of the blind vulgar, Ye instigators of an impious sect, Must I be doom'd eternally to hear Your arrogant harangues?âOf all the griefs That plant the throne, on which I sit, with thorns, These are the hardest to endure: yet I Am forced to endure them, till my tarnished throne Resume, by my means, all its original brightness. SCENE THE THIRD. Mary, Ormond. Or. Oh queen, to thee, the messenger of peace, And the confirmer of eternal friendship, Elizabeth hath sent me: in her name, In every enterprize, I offer thee Her powerful assistance. Ma. I already Know by experience what her friendship is; Hence mayest thou infer the extent of mine. Or. Hence I derive the confidence, and courage, To intercede with thee ... Ma. For whom? Or. Thou knowest That marriage-rites have not yet shackled her; That of her throne thy son is hitherto The only successor: may it please thee, For the dear sake of this beloved child, The hope of both these realms, precious to us, No less than to thyself, to banish from thee All rancour that thy heart may entertain Against his father. Thou, at all events, Would'st chuse him for thy spouse; and can it now Be true, that a precipitate divorce Should sever him from thee? ... Ma. And who has spread Such tales of me? False be they, or malignant, Yet if the threshold of Elizabeth Haply they reach, must they find faith in her? Not e'en a single project of divorce I ever entertained; yet were it so, What meanest thou? Could that to her give umbrage, Whom to my nuptials formerly I found So utterly averse? Or. Elizabeth, Though never envious of thy happiness, Was jealous of thy honour. She applied Counsel both frank and friendly, to thy free And royal judgment. She dissuaded thee From nuptials perhaps somewhat less illustrious, Than might befit an independent princess; But nothing more. Persuaded thoroughly Of thy fixed resolution, she was silent; Nor do I think that blame to her attaches, If thou art not in perfect happiness. Ma. 'Tis true: kept she not in hard fetters bound Henry, whom I had chosen for my consort, So, that a fugitive from prison, he Came to my royal bed; and his right hand, Yet livid from the pressure of her chains, To my right hand he joined? does she not now, In a well-guarded tower, within her realm, Retain by force the mother of my spouse? 'Tis well becoming her, indeed, to feel, To-day, compassion for her former prisoner.â Thou should'st from this most exquisite distress Relieve her, by assuring her, that Henry Lives, at his pleasure, in full liberty, Within its precincts, or remote from court; That from my heart I have not banished him; And that I never knew, nor know I now, To investigate the private cares of others. Or. Nor does Elizabeth, within thy palace, Presume to penetrate, more than is fitting, With curious indiscretion. Royal secrets, Though known to all, to every king are sacred. I am commanded to suggest to thee Respectfully, that to a double realm, One heir alone affords a hope too scanty; And that the existence of a single child Has much of casualty and incertitude. Ma. This most magnanimous solicitude Of her great heart hath in my heart inspired Reciprocal solicitude. I yet Cherish the hope to be again a mother: And yet to make her happy, who partakes In all my joys, with a new numerous offspring. But if she is as prodigal of aid As of advice to me, I hope ere long To see in perfect peace, not only this My palace, but my realm. Or. To obtain such peace, I in her name now venture to propose As the best means ... Ma. They are? Or. No doubtful means. She wishes thee somewhat more mild to those Who not thy yoke, but that of Rome, have spurn'd. E'en as thy other, these are faithful subjects, And far surpassing them in strength and numbers; They feel as men, and are thy loyal sons; To whom their different creed alone procures Such disproportionate oppression. SCENE THE FOURTH. Mary, Ormond, Bothwell. Ma. Ah, come; oh Bothwell, enter these apartments. Hear what incredible advice, to me, The representative of England's queen Brings, in his mistress' name. She wishes me More mild towards the heretics; she wishes Myself and Henry indivisible; And trembles lest divorce should sever us. Both. Now who could give her of thy government Such false impressions? What religious sect Hast thou e'er persecuted? Who to-day Dares even to pronounce the word divorce? This day, on which Henry returns to thee ... Or. To-day, say'st thou? Ma. Yes ... Now thou see'st how I Anticipate Elizabeth's desires. Or. Deceitful fame exempts not even kings.â Laden with false intelligence it came E'en to my mistress; as there came to thee A character of her not less fallacious, Which painted her thy foe. I entertain (Perhaps 'tis self-flattery) the lofty hope Of being of your genuine sentiments The not unwelcome true interpreter, While, in compliance with the will of each, A station in thy presence I maintain No less felicitous than dignified. Ma. Oft are the deeds of those, by lofty rank Exposed to scrutiny, perversely judged: Mine, hitherto by innocence inspired, Shrink from no witnesses. Be they made known By thee to Elizabeth: meanwhile, as well For thy own sake as her's who sent thee hither, Thou wilt be always honour'd in my court. SCENE THE FIFTH. Mary, Bothwell. Ma. Hard to endure! Well do I know her hate And rancour; yet am I constrain'd to admit And honour her delator. With new arts She now assails me. Recommends the good That I may do it not. She asks of me To grant a toleration to the sects; Then, that I persecute them, in her heart She wishes. She dissuades me from divorce; Ah! then she hopes to hasten it. I know That much as ever sceptred mortal err'd, She wills that I should err. With her own arts I shall know how to parry her attacks. I will, by granting her dissembled wishes, More and more torture her malignant heart. Both. Thou know'st I said this to thee, when thou deignedst To unfold thy thoughts to me. Henry should not Now be remote from thee for various reasons. Whether his menaces to quit the realm Be true or feign'd, thou ought'st to take from him The means of doing it, by watching over him. Ma. The shame of such a flight would fall on me. His throne, his son, his country, and his consort, Quitting, and begging a precarious shelter; Who that beholds him thus will deem me guitless? I will not be a fable to the world; Rather will I embrace the worst misfortunes. Both. Thou hast well chosen. Oh! were this the day That full domestic peace return'd once more! Since he to thy solicitations yields, To which he hitherto was deaf, at length Thou mayest hope. Ma. Yes, I would fain believe it. At length, a true, though late remorse, for all His past ingratitude, conducts him here. He still will find me to himself unchanged: And, if I see him penitent, disposed To pardon all the past. Both. Ah! were he so! Thou know'st full well how much I wish thee happy. Ma. The recollection of my debt to thee Will never quit my mind. Thou hast avenged The throne insulted by the foes of Rizio, By their just punishment. I found in thee A sure defender in the camp, against The open rebels; 'gainst the hidden ones, More despicable far, to me wert thou A faithful counsellor within my court. Thou hast at once contrived to disconcert Henry's imprudent plots, and recollect That that same Henry was thy sovereign's husband. Both. Fatal address! Ah! may there no more be Occasion for exerting it! Ma. Ah! yes ... If Henry hear me, and believe my love, (Which he alone believes not,) I may yet Hope for all happiness. The throne to me Is far less precious than my husband's heart. But let us hear him; I have hopes e'en yet: Heaven may do much; fortune may be propitious ... But where I would of counsel or address Avail myself, thou more than other men My projects canst promote. Both. My arm, my blood, My substance, and my judgment, (if indeed I be so gifted,) all, oh queen, are thine.</field>

Yes, I repeat it to thee, I come hither To wreak full vengeance on my enemies, Or bid eternal farewell to these walls. Mur. Thou doest well. But thou should'st not, oh king, Flatter thyself with prosperous event To thy designs, while thou dost steel thy heart Against its inward conflicts of remorse, Against the frequently-repeated signs Of an offended God. Thou long hast been Fully convinced of the errors of the faith That thou professest: the dire vestiges, At every step, by thousands and by thousands, Of thy perverse and persecuting sect Crowd on thy path: yet dar'st thou not shake off The guilty yoke of sacrilegious Rome; Whence in the sight of all the world thou art Despised, and impious in the sight of God. This is the first, too plainly, and, alas! This the sole cause of thy adversity. Hen. More than convinced I am that I ought not E'er to have sought this fatal royal marriage: Not that the rank to which it raises me O'erwhelms my faculties; this very sceptre Was no unknown weight to my ancestors. But I regret that I reflected not What a capricious and unstable thing The heart of woman is; and what a weight A benefit imposes, when received From one that is not skill'd to give it wisely. Mur. My soul is not cast in a vulgar mould: Hear me, oh Henry. Favour in the court I do not seek: the love of peace inspires me. 'Tis in thy power for all thy past mistakes To make a full atonement, and to win To paths of virtue thy bewilder'd consort; To make thy people blest: the chosen sons, Not of the terrible God of wrath and blood, (Whose earthly type is fulminating Rome,) But the true sons of the compassionate God, Who are iniquitously trodden down, These may'st thou rescue; and may'st dissipate The impure mists, which from the Tyber's stream, The corrupt source of tyranny and fraud, With pestilential influence arise. Hen. And what? wilt thou that I mispend my time In disputations vain about vain rites, And frivolous subtleties of brain-sick fools, When I am loudly call'd on to defend My honour and my rank? Mur. Dar'st thou miscall These questions vain, When they a thousand times Have ta'en away and given realms and lives? If thy heart feels a just contempt for Rome, Why not confess it? Raise thy standard high, And thou shalt have as many partizans As there are here who execrate her rites. Hen. I do not feed myself with civil bloodshed: To seek elsewhere that peace I have not here ... Mur. What are thy hopes? Will it bring peace to thee To see from distant climes thy native country Burn with intestine broils? For to fly hence Is but assuredly to give the signal For civil war.âTo arms I prompt thee not; I am not, no, the minister of blood. To frustrate more atrocious grievances, And from oppression liberate thy friends, Ere to rebellion they be driven, to this, Nought else, do I exhort thee. Violence Thou should'st not use; but hinder that of others. Mary, who with her foreign milk imbibed As at a fountain inexhaustible Foreign delusions; Mary, who unites, For Scotland's ruin, in her youthful breast The persecuting principles of Rome With the soft manners of effeminate France, I do not bid thee ever to forget That the same Mary is thy spouse and sovereign: Leave her at her own will to think and act: We have not learn'd her persecuting tenets; We wish alone for liberty and peace: May they be gain'd through thee! Thou mayest at once Procure thy peace and ours. An obscure storm I see, which threatens us, which also may Fall on thy head, if thou refuse to hear me. The vilest miscreants in these precincts lurk, And lurk in numbers, who would ruin thee, And who at once calumniate and detest thee. In vain thou would'st among them hope to find Sincerity and honour; we are they, If yet indeed there be true Scots; of Rome, Of guilty, foreign, and effeminate fashions The inveterate foes; and equally the foes Of foreign and augmenting tyranny. Would'st be the moderate king of worthy men? 'Tis yet within thy power: would'st rather be The tyrant of the guilty? There are they Who wish this more than thou. There are who have Already made a sceptre of the sword: The knot is too perplex'd; it must be cut, It cannot be unloosed. Why thus I speak Heaven knows; and if I wish for aught but peace. Act then according to thy judgment: I Already have resign'd the hope that truth Should by a king be e'er from me believed. SCENE THE SECOND. Henry. Hen. Murray may be sincere; but my hard fate Hath so o'erruled me that the choice of errors Alone remains for me.âAlready all Convinces me that I return in vain: Each tongue is dumb; and the reluctant queen Delays to welcome me; and all the rest ... Oh rage! ... But she approaches: be she heard; I shall be better able to resolve After this conference. SCENE THE THIRD. Henry, Mary. Ma. Thou'rt welcome here, Thou, whom I chose for all my griefs and joys The inseparable partner. Thou at last Compliest, and dost listen to my prayers: At length within thy palace thou returnest; That it is always thine thou knowest well, Although in voluntary banishment From thence it pleases thee to live so far. Hen. Queen ... Ma. Why thus call me? Why not call me consort? Hen. Say, are our destinies the same? Ma. Ah! no; Thou mak'st me spend my tedious days in tears ... Hen. My tears thou seest not ... Ma. I have beheld thee Bedew, 'tis true, thy cheek with tears of rage, Never of love. Hen. Be the cause what it may, I wept, and still I weep. Ma. And who can cure This ceaseless grief, who wipe my tearful eyes, Who to my heart restore pure genuine joy, Who, if not thou? Hen. Which of us has the power, And having that, the will, will soon be seen. Meanwhile I tell thee that to-day I do not Come to repeated insults ... Ma. Why wilt thou, Oh heaven! thus irritate before thou hearest me? If thou deem it an insult to behold Other men's judgments not submit to thine, Here oft, I grant, but always spite of me, Wert thou insulted. Their immunities Monarchs possess, and monarchies their laws, And their infringement is to all injurious; Nor dared I hinder thee from breaking them, Than as I should myself have been restrain'd If an unwise desire had prompted me To arbitrary power. But if of me, If of my heart thou speakest, of my love For thee, and of my private fondnesses, Beloved consort, what part of myself Have I not given thee unreservedly? My lord and my support, say, wert not thou My first, my last, my sole solicitude? And thou wilt evermore be so, if thou Wilt only lay aside thy unjust wrath, And far as usage of the law permits, E'en now indeed wilt be lord of the realm, And, without any limitation, mine. Hen. The ostentation I esteem an insult; The haughty manners towards myself adopted By the audacious ministers, or friends, Or slaves, or counsellors, or parasites, For I know not how I should designate Those that around thee stand. And I esteem That which I meet with every day an insult; To be still flatter'd by the name of king, While I'm not only of the power bereft, But even of the superficial pomp That waits on royalty; to see myself Rather in servitude than liberty; My motions and my words, my deeds and thoughts, Investigated all, and all betray'd; Bereft of every solace of a father; Not only not to be allow'd to watch The education of my only son, But from his presence to be interdicted; And myself only.âWhy should I say more? What boots it to enumerate one by one My many wrongs? Thou know'st how comfortless, How much neglected, and how much oppress'd, Degraded, and perhaps how much betray'd, Is he whom thou unluckily hast chosen The partner of thy throne, yet having chosen, Whom self-respect forbids thee to despise. Ma. Perhaps I also might reply to thee That thy incautious actions have alone So far reduced thee; and I might suggest, With what unworthy recompense at first Thou didst return my love; that more intent To subjugate, than, with benignant arts, To gain the minds of Scotland's haughty chiefs, Impatient of restraint, thou lost them quite; And too much trusting in thy faithless friends, At first thou drewest from their intercourse Pernicious counsels, treason afterwards, And detriment, and forfeiture of love. I might speak further ... But can I proceed? ... Ah, no! ... That is a superficial love Which watches, blames, or does presume to judge The imperfections of the beloved object. To oblivion everlastingly by me Be these consign'd. If it can soothe thy heart That I should seem the injurer, not the injured, So let it be: 'tis unimportant to me Where lies the cause, so that we both escape, And chiefly thou, all baneful consequence. Do thou and all thy friends calm thoughts resume: Open once more thy breast to confidence; Nor let fantastic thoughts of novelty Thy judgment captivate. Within thy palace Reigning, learn thou the arts of government. I do not dare propose myself to thee As one well skill'd in such a complex art; For inexpert, I oftentimes have err'd: My immature capacity, my sex, And perhaps a natural defect of judgment, In many indiscretions have involved me. I only know, as far as in me lies, To chuse sagacious and just counsellors; And, hence assisted, with a trembling foot To try the vast and formidable lists Of perilous royalty. Ah! were I skill'd In reigning as I am in loving thee! Hen. But, save thy husband, each man in the court Appears a just sagacious counsellor: And he's the only one in whom designs Of private benefit may not abide ... Ma. Or at least ought not.âBut refrain awhile: Thou in my heart hast fix'd suspicion's wound; And do thou heal it. Not that I retain, I swear to thee, the recollection of it, Much less its rancour: ah, believe my words. But separation does not strengthen love, Nor mitigate suspicion. By my side Stand evermore; I shall esteem that day For ever fortunate on which I shall Be able to give, in exchange for one, A thousand proofs of love. Malignant spies, I know, there are not wanting, who delight Betwixt us to maintain disgraceful discord, And seek perhaps to foment it. But, if thou Wilt evermore be near me, in whom else, Better than in thyself, can I confide? Hen. I hear seducing words, but I endure Deeds of increasing rancour. Ma. But what would'st thou? Speak; and I will do all. Hen. I would, in fact, Be father, consort, king; or of these names I will divest myself ... Ma. Thou would'st have all Except my heart. And more than thy demand Refusal wounds my soul. Ah! would to heaven That thou at least with this wert satisfied. Yes, far as in me lies, thou shalt have all; I only ask of thee, that thou preserve Some decency towards me before the world; And that henceforward thou repeat no more Thy ancient exhibition of contempt. Ah! if thou love me not, let others think, At least, that thou esteemest me! To this I do conjure thee by the common pledge Not of thy love, but mine. Thou shalt again Behold our only, our beloved son; To thy paternal arms shall he be brought; That thou art a king, a consort, and a father, May he remind thee. Hen. I am well aware What is my duty; if I have appear'd Unequal to its weight, the fault was theirs Who have from me transferr'd it to themselves. To-day am I resolved, e'en more than others, To recompense affection with affection, But artifice with scorn.âThis single day Will be sufficient to bring all to light. I in the faces of thy friends shall see, The court's implicit rule, thy secret thoughts. SCENE THE FOURTH. Mary, Bothwell. Both. May I approach, the exulting spectator Of thy recovered joy? Thy husband, say, Of what complexion are his present thoughts? Is he reform'd? ... Ma. Inflexibly the same. What do I say? He to his former rage Unites a smile of bitter irony; And turns to ridicule my earnest words. Ah, wretched me! What means have I now left To soften his asperity? I speak Of love; he speaks of power: I am the injured, Yet he the plaintiff. By ambitious thoughts, Yet destitute of all sublimity, His bosom is attainted and depraved. Both. But what does he demand? Ma. Absolute power. Both. Hast thou that to confer? Ma. He now would deem That power a bauble which I gave to him Ere he compell'd me to resume the gift. He has entirely yielded to oblivion The perils whence I rescued him. Both. Yet thou Canst not, without incurring blame, refuse To share that power of which thyself art mistress With him that is thy husband. That which he Possess'd before, that which the laws give to him, E'en at thy risk thou must restore him all. Ma. I still should have, if I could love him less, E'en more than one resource: to suffer him, Left to himself, headlong to rush at once In numberless inextricable snares; For the result can ne'er be prosperous Of his ill-plann'd and worse-transacted schemes. But I exist, assail'd on every side By an o'erwhelming tempest. His misfortunes, In one respect, affect me more than him;... But yet, if he alone prefers his ruin ... Still will that ruin be a heavy blow To me, come when it may.âAnd then ... my son!... Oh heaven! if towards my son my thoughts I turn, On whom, perchance, the errors of his father May one day fall! ... I am no longer able ... Both. Queen, thou desir'st me not to flatter thee: And I impose it on myself to serve thee. A mother's and a consort's love alone Combat within thy bosom. Save thy son, Thou should'st give all to Henry. Ma. And that son Precisely, more than all the rest, he asks. Both. But is he thine to give? Say, is he not Rather our public pledge? Where were the wonder If he, a guilty spouse, proved a worse father? Ma. But yet, to quiet his perturbed spirit, I promised him ... Both. Thy son? He to rule him? Take heed. Ma. He to rule him? I myself venture not To do it; and to others shall I yield him? Both. 'Tis then but a precautionary step, Lest others take him from thee? Ma. âTo what tend These thy insinuations? Perhaps thou knowest ... Both. I? ... Nothing ... But I think that perhaps by chance Henry to-day return'd not. Hitherto I've been the first to cut off all the means Whence the vain threats of Henry (whether feign'd Or real) e'er could be reported to thee By the informers that in courts abound. But to more culpable contrivances Should he direct his thoughts, whate'er the risk, 'Twould be my duty to reveal to thee, Not what he says, but what he aims to do. Ma. He hath been hitherto assuredly To my repeated invitations deaf ... And now, who knows? ... But speak ... perhaps today Some indirect and circumventing purpose May bring him back to court. Both. I do not think it; But I should be a witless counsellor If I from time to time suggested not Precautionary thoughts of what may be. He never was assail'd for this his son With overweening fondness: wherefore then Demand him now? Ormond likewise pretends Anxious desire to see the royal youth: And he brings with him all the stratagems Of his most crafty queen: all may be fear'd; Yet nothing there may be; but on the throne Blind trust is an unpardonable fault. Ma. Must I for ever from one agony Be driven to another? Wretched fate! ... Yet what can I now do? Both. Watch while I watch; Thou canst do nought beside: if it be false, My fear can do no harm; if true, some good. Under what pretext seems most plausible, Only contrive that Henry now should have Apartments separate from these in which The royal youth resides; and leave him here Guarded by thy most faithful partizans Unintermittingly. Do thou henceforward Go from this place, and occupy with Henry As a more cheerful or more healthy dwelling, The ancient castle which commands the city: There may'st thou quickly see what influence Thy love has o'er him: Thus thou clear'st his path, If thoughts of reformation sway his will; And thus, if evil purposes possess him, Preventest him from injuring e'en himself. Ma. Wise is thy counsel; I adhere to it. Do thou meanwhile for my security, Glory, and peace, efficient means invent, And gentle ones, whence I may frustrate ills Past remedy, if gathering strength from time.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Henry. Hen. No, delay profits not; nor should I now Temporise longer. Spite of my desire, A treacherous pageantry of honour waits me. Why is this unaccustomed dwelling place To me assign'd? ... 'Tis true, beneath one roof Innocence and imposture ill unite; The treacherous palace is no home for me: But the insult is too manifest; too manifest The implied mistrust. Let me decide at last, At last adopt some measures.âOrmond seeks To speak to me; let him be heard. Perchance He may suggest, when I the least expect it, Some remedy, some project of deliverance. SCENE THE SECOND. Henry, Ormond. Hen. To this new court, which has no parallel, Thou'rt welcome, Ormond. Or. Thy vicissitudes To us are too well known. Elizabeth, A mere spectator, hither sends me not: But, her heart full of grief for thee, she wills That I should be 'twixt you the instrument Of perfect peace. Hen. Peace? Where there is not found Entire equality, peace? Oftentimes Have I been flatter'd with so fond a hope, But still have been deceived. Or. But yet, methinks, This day to peace is sacred ... Hen. Thou'rt deceived. To pass all bounds of sufferance with me This is the day selected: and at once This is the day on which I have resolved No more to suffer. Or. What! dost thou believe That the queen's heart is not towards thee sincere? Hen. Her heart? Who sees it? But not even words Hear I from her, in which I may confide. Or. If she deceive thee, thy disdain is just. Although I come the messenger of peace, Yet I presume (instructed thus to act, If it were needful, by Elizabeth) To offer thee, whiche'er best suit thy wishes, Advice, assistance, or to be thy guide. Hen. If in my heart ignoble passions dwelt, Without assistance, I could means devise, And certain means of vengeance. But alas! Nor guide, nor guardian friend are there, who now Were competent to clear the obstructed path For the attainment of the peace I wish. Oh, bitter is the state in which I live! If towards violence I turn my thoughts, If then indeed not criminal, forthwith, I seem at least ungrateful: yet, again, If I in part relent, the insolence, And the presumption, of those courtly slaves, Who are the origin of every ill, Beyond all bounds I foster. Thence I fix, Amid the many schemes I might pursue, On nothing long: and to them all prefer To go from hence in voluntary exile. Or. What would'st thou do, oh king? This remedy, If I might be allowed to speak to thee, Appears to me worse than the ill itself. Hen. So it seems not to me: and I expect That hence more injury would fall on others, Than shame upon myself. Or. But know'st thou not, That an expatriated king excites Rather contempt than pity? And should he Even excite compassion, would he thence Be ever satisfied? Hen. When power is gone, What profits arrogance? I now am here, Of all men least, a monarch not obeyed. Or. But thou in changing climes, would'st thou obtain The privileges private men enjoy? Or of a monarch's name divest thyself? Ah! since thou givest me with thy discourse Boldness to speak, let me convince thee of it.â Whither direct thy steps? To France? Reflect That there to Mary is the royal race Allied by blood and friendship; that all there Applaud her character, where she at first Imbibed their soft insinuating customs. There thou wilt find a messenger from Rome, Furnished with pardons and indulgences, Ready to invade, if thou givest place to him, This miserable realm. Thus to thy foes Thou wilt thyself surrender: instantly They will contrive to prove thee criminal. Hen. And do I live surrounded here by friends? Or. Thou livest in thy kingdom.âI should add To thee, in vain, how the perfidious Spaniard, The effeminate Italian, an asylum, The one precarious, the other infamous, Would offer to thy person: I proceed: (And thence thou may'st infer if I speak truth) I, in the first place, counsel thee to fly To Elizabeth for shelter. Hen. Shall a land Be my asylum where I once was prisoner? I never entertained so wild a thought: There is my mother forcibly confined ... Or. Dost thou not see it clearly? Much less free, And less secure, here would thy mother be Than she is there. I controvert it not; Elizabeth was adverse to thee once: But royal counsels change with change of times. Scarce did she see from you an heir arise, Of her no less than his maternal realm, Than she, entirely pacified, towards him, As towards her offspring, turned her every thought; And more reluctant from this time became To yield herself to the connubial yoke. Afterwards hearing that thou had'st incurred The disesteem of Mary; and that those Who had thrown off the servitude of Rome Pined in oppression, that the royal child, E'en with his milk, perniciously imbibed Errors of superstition, much she grieved. Hence she commanded me, if towards thyself Mary changed not her conduct, to direct To thee alone the instructions I received; And means I offer thee, (not means of blood, For as thyself I hold those means accursed) By which thou wilt infallibly regain All thy primeval splendour,âin one word, By which thou may'st be free; propitiate Elizabeth; to thy beloved son Secure a loftier, and a safer station; Snatch Mary from imposture; disconcert Thy guilty foes; all this, if so thou wilt, Quickly thou may'st perform. Hen. What dost thou mean? Or. That which is possible to do: which thou Alone canst do, others not e'en attempt.â The royal heir, thy son, will be the means Of thy advancement, and at once of peace ... Hen. How? ... Or. In these thresholds maxims are instilled That will confirm his servitude to Rome; He that is destined one day to possess The united sceptres of Britannia's isle. Elizabeth, and with her, all her realm, With vigilant and apprehensive looks, Behold this threaten'd bias: recent yet Are in my country the inflicted wounds, With which another Mary tortured her, At the instigation of the Spanish Philip. Eternal, and immitigable hate, And such devotion of heroic rage, Hath Spain to us bequeath'd, that each of us Had rather perish, than again obey The abhorred and cruel ritual of blood. Thy son will be compelled to disavow The Roman worship, should the day arrive, When he is called to fill the British throne; Were it not better for himself, for us, That he should ne'er imbibe a heresy, Which, would he be our king, he must recant? Hen. Who denies this? And thou perhaps thinkest me More in my heart attached to Rome than others? But how can I, according to my judgment, Bring up my son, whose very intercourse To me is interdicted? Or. But would'st thou Be master of his person, by that step Thou would'st gain all. Hen. Hence is he taken from me. Or. And hence should'st thou recover him. Hen. But guards Watch always. Or. These may be deceived, be bribed ... Hen. And grant that I obtain him; afterwards How shall I keep him ... Or. I will keep him for thee. Beneath Elizabeth's protecting eye He shall grow up: and she will be to him More than a mother. Fed with lofty thoughts, There shall he learn to reign; let me avail Only to rescue him from hence, and thou Shalt quickly see thyself the master here. Elizabeth shall make thee be proclaimed, During his adolescence, for thy son, The sovereign-regent of this realm; henceforth Thou may'st assign thy spouse what part seems best Of delegated power; precisely that, in short, Which she appears to thee to merit. Hen. âThis Is a momentous scheme ... Or. Does it offend thee? Hen. No; but it seems of difficult performance. Or. Be but audacious; all will then be easy.â Hen. We have conferred too long. Leave me awhile: I would reflect upon it at my leisure.â Or. Ere long then I return to thee: the time Is urgent ... Hen. When the night is far advanced, And unobserved, as much as possible, Return to me. Or. I will at thy commands Come here. Meanwhile, oh Henry, recollect, That blows when least expected always fall The most severe; that purposes of state Require it; and that thou wilt hence derive Both honour and advantage to thyself. SCENE THE THIRD. Henry. Hen. I hence win honour, if I win advantage.â This is a mighty scheme, and mighty ills May hence originate ... But yet, what ills? Though it bestead me not, so circumstanced Am I, that nothing now can injure me ... Who comes? What can that man now seek from me? SCENE THE FOURTH. Henry, Bothwell. Hen. What wantest thou with me? Bring'st thou perchance The accustomed homage to thy pageant king? Both. Although thou treatest me with such disdain, I, not the less, am still thy faithful subject. To thee the queen dispatch'd me: she has learn'd, That thou, as of an insult, bitterly Complainest of the abode assign'd to thee. Know, that she means, ere long, hither to come With thee to dwell: and further I am bound To say to thee ... Hen. More than the different dwelling, Far more, it mortifies me to observe That every word I utter is repeated: Yet this injustice is not new to me. Now go; and tell her, that, if I ought not To deem myself thence injured, such excuse Although not more believed, at least had been More welcome from her lips; and not by means Of an ambassador ... Both. If thou would'st lend To her a somewhat more benignant ear, My lord, far other sentiments than these Thou would'st hear from her lips: nor should I be The messenger selected: but, she fears Lest that her words to thee ... Hen. She apprehends To wound me with her words, and at once seeks To do it with her deeds. Both. Thou art deceived. I know how much she loves thee; and in proof, I, though unwelcome to thee, though by thee Suspected wrongfully, addressed myself To bring to thee a message so important, That to another than myself the queen Would not confide it: it is such that thou Art bound to hear it; neither from her lips Would Mary venture to express it to thee: A message, that 'tis difficult to speak, But yet, which, if conveyed as she suggested, As the expostulation of a friend, Clearly denotes no lukewarm tenderness. Hen. Com'st thou the interpreter of nuptial secrets?â Thou, who art thou? Both. Since thou would'st fain forget The action of Dunbar, whence, having first The rebels slain, I reconducted you Both here in safety to your throne; I am One who, because it is imposed on him, Now speaks to thee. Hen. But it is not imposed On me to hear thee. Both. Yet thou hearest others. Hen. What say'st thou? Others? ... What audacity? ... Both. Thou in these thresholds art betrayed; but not By those whom thou mistrustest. Thou thyself, E'en more than all of us, should'st doubt a man, To whom the function of ambassador, Impulse and opportunity affords To perfidy unpunished. To ourselves Ormond comes not the messenger of peace; And yet thou hearest him at length; ... Hen. Ye traitors!â Is this to me imputed as a crime? E'en as ye are perfidious ye are vile; Ye twist to evil every deed of mine. Ormond the entreated audience obtain'd: I sought him not: ambassador to me He came not here ... Both. Assuredly he came Contriving machinations 'gainst thyself. Were he alone a traitor! But already E'en more defective in dexterity Than in discretion, he has proved himself. Far too precipitately he divulged His hidden hopes, his culpable designs: With this incaution he betray'd himself So prematurely, that before he spoke With thee, the queen already knew the whole. Nor thence, for him, whom he would fain delude, Has the queen's bosom so much wrath conceived As generous pity. In her name, oh king, I do adjure thee to renounce thy error; Nor with thy own dishonour, do thou bring Advantage to the traitor, detriment To her who loves thee. Hen. âMore explicitly Speak thou, or cease to speak. Mysterious words I do not comprehend: I only know, That where ye all of you alike are traitrous, I can among you scarcely recognize Which of you is the traitor. Both. 'Tis most easy To see who most would profit by thy ruin. Elizabeth, your persevering foe, Your envious, crafty, and ferocious foe, Dreads peace betwixt you. What canst hope from her? Hen. From her? ... I nothing hope, and nothing ask ... And nothing ... But what knowest thou? Speak on. What is alleged against me? What believes, And what says, Mary? ... Both. When a heart is generous, There need no others to reprove its faults. What ought I now to say? Except that Ormond Is an incendiary; that snares are laid For thy destruction; and that for thy son, Thy innocent son, Mary, with many tears, Conjures thee now ... Hen. Oh! wherefore does she weep? ... Thou layest snares for me ... Both. My lord, thou art Thy own deceiver; I do not deceive thee. The schemes of Ormond were already known: Already from his indiscreet expressions, Before he came here to propose it to thee, That impious stratagem transpired ... Hen. To me? ... How darest thou, miscreant, thus speak to me? ... If thou proceedest, I will make thee ... Both. Thus, My lord, I have fulfill'd the task imposed. Hen. And I my toleration have exhausted. Both. I spoke, because I was impell'd by duty. Hen. Beyond thy duty hast thou spoken. Hence. Both. What to the queen must I report? Hen. Go; tell her ... That thou art rash. Both. My lord ... Hen. What; not yet gone? SCENE THE FIFTH. Henry. Hen. All, all are base; and I am like the rest.â Oh, dark abyss of infamy and fraud! Ah fool, that could, in an ambassador Sent from Elizabeth, place confidence ... SCENE THE SIXTH. Henry, Ormond. Hen. Return'st thou here so soon? Or. One doubt alone Remains unsatisfied: hence I return ... Hen. Thou witless traitor! darest thou in my sight Appear again? Or. Alas! what has befallen? Hen. Say, didst thou hope that I should not discover, From whence thy fraudulent proposals sprung? And further, hopest thou that they should remain Unpunish'd? Or. Whence so unexpectedly Art thou thus changed? ... Erewhile thou spakest to me ... Hen. Erewhile I wished to see, to what a length Thy hostile and insidious stratagems, Beneath a mask of peace, would carry thee.â But didst thou ever think that I would deign To supplicate in your deceitful realm Assistance for myself, or for my son A perilous asylum? Or. If I was The artificer of fraud with thee, think'st thou That it was now my fault? Hen. It was the fault Both of thyself, and her who sent thee here, And of thy hated function ... Or. Rather say Of the abhorred court in which I'm stationed: The crime was hatch'd in this perfidious soil. Should I have ever, of my own accord, Presumed to tamper with thee? In such guilt Mary involved me; to whose will, in all things, Elizabeth commanded me to yield. That which she will'd I said: and now, of this, A double treachery, accuses me To thee.âOh no, I shall not be deceived; May heaven permit, henceforth, that I engage In no transaction with a race like this. Whatever here may be the consequence, I feel that I am innocent; such now Do I proclaim myself; and such elsewhere I shall proclaim myself with loftier voice. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Henry. Hen. Thou say'st the truth; whose guilt is like to hers? I am the laughing-stock of all. Oh rage!â Once more shall this perfidious woman hear me, Yet once more hear my voice. I am compell'd To give the last indulgence to my rage In a few words; but afterwards 'tis time To try more rigorous efficacious measures.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Henry, Mary. Hen. Queen, I abhor deceit; it serves me not; And, if it served me, I would not adopt it. But thou, why dost thou clothe perfidious schemes, With simulated love? I have, I know, Offended thee; but openly I did it. Thou should'st from me have learn'd at least the rules By which 'tis lawful to offend an equal. Ma. What words are these? What hast thou met with, say? Or ere firm peace betwixt us is renew'd, I hear already ... Hen. Peace 'twixt us, say'st thou? I swear betwixt us everlasting discord: Avow thy purposes; and copy me: I would, at last, to thee point out the way, By which thou may'st pour out thy fathomless, And pent-up rancour; I would spare to thee Further deceptions, further flatteries, And further crimes. Ma. Oh heavens! and such rebuke Do I deserve from thee? Hen. 'Tis fitly said. Thy guilt at length to such a pitch is risen, That all rebukes are vain. Disdainful silence Were more judicious; to thy crimes more fitted:â But yet, this transient utterance somewhat soothes me; And, for the last time, now to make thee hear This voice, which to thy conscience-stricken heart Is not supportable. Means of redress, Less infamous, and more effectual far Than thine, are in my power. In thousand ways I might, within thy realm, make head against thee: Nor does thy power divert me from the purpose: Myself alone commands inaction here: I would not in our private broils involve This unoffending people.âBut to-morrow Thou shalt hear tidings of my destiny: And may I never more behold thy face. To thy remorse, (if even that remains) And to thy faithful counsellors, I leave thee. Ma. Ungrateful ... with more fitting epithet Not to address thee ... of my boundless love Is this the recompense? My sufferance long? My unexampled sufferance? ... Speak'st thou thus? ... Thus clear'st thee of thy fault?âWhence thy contempt? Dost thou no more remember who I am? And who thou wert? Ah, pardon, pardon me; Thou now compellest me to adopt a language, To her that speaks it, far more than to him Who hears it, insupportable. But how, In what have I offended thee? By thus Inviting thee, entreating thy return? By the unguarded warmth of my reception? By yielding thee too much? By deeming thee Accessible to penitential thoughts, Or wise resolves, or thy hard heart possess'd E'en of a momentary gratitude. Hen. The throne thou fillest: and the throne was ever Prolific in conclusive arguments. But I am not amazed: whate'er has happen'd Confirms the fears of my foreboding heart. Yet, is it fitting that I should assure thee I never had recourse to artifice; That I have not, so much as thou may'st deem, A weak, a headstrong, or an abject spirit; And that thy shameful arts ... Ma. Act as thou wilt: I only do beseech thee not to soil Thy language towards me with injurious phrases; Thence equally unworthy him who speaks, And her constrain'd to hear them. Hen. Evermore In words do I offend thee; thou in deeds Offendest me. Is the remembrance fled? ... Ma. Profound remembrance in my heart I keep Of the remonstrances so often utter'd, And so much disregarded; faithful, true, And wise remonstrances, which, what thou art, Thy manners, and thy dispositions, painted, Ere I bestowed on thee this hand of mine.â Blinded by love, I would not see, believe ... Who then dissembled? ... Speak, ungrateful, speak ... Alas, alas!âRepentance now is late, And fruitless ... Oh my God! ... and is it true That thou, at all events, would'st rather I Should be thy foe? ... That thou canst never make me. Thou plainly seest, that thou canst scarcely raise A transient flame of anger in my breast: One word of thine, one little word, suffices To cancel every provocation past: Provided thou would'st hear it, my affection Is ready still to whisper to my heart All its too welcome flatteries. Oh my husband, Why wilt thou not, whate'er it be, confess The reason of thy recent discontent? Quickly will I ... Hen. Art thou desirous then To hear it from my lips; although it is Well known to thee, no less than to myself? Thou shalt be satisfied without delay. 'Tis not thy feign'd affection; not thy feign'd, And flattering words; not the allotted dwelling; 'Tis not the separation from my son; The promise of supreme authority Changed into more intolerable wrongs; I do not, no, of all these things complain: These with the usual tenor correspond Of thy deportment towards me; all the fault Is mine, that I believed thee. But the wrong, The only wrong that I cannot endure, Is that which thou hast recently contrived. And what? At last thou call'st Elizabeth, In the so many indiscreet offences With which thou plottest hourly to annoy me, The false Elizabeth to take a part? Ma. What dost thou now allege against me? What? And say what proof hast thou? ... Hen. Ormond, 'tis true, Is, but is not like others here, perfidious: In vain thou sentest him to flatter me, To tempt, to promise, to seduce. Didst thou E'er hear of such a plot? At all events, To wish to goad me into treachery? Whence pretexts thou might'st afterwards derive For thy concealed iniquity ... Ma. What do I hear? May heaven to ashes instantly reduce me, If I e'er ... Hen. Perjury avails not here. At once I recognized the artifice, And, the deceiver to deceive, I feign'd To yield to his entreaties: but I loathe, And I am wearied of, such abject arts. Ormond already has received from me A final answer. Now Elizabeth Will scorn thee, who detested thee before, And she will be the first to blame, and raise A clamorous outcry 'gainst those very crimes, To which herself impell'd thee. Ma. This is all A vile imposture. Who thus dares to soil My name with guilt? ... Hen. Thy minions possess Souls thoroughly imbued with perfidy. Do not afflict thyself: they have but shewn Themselves not fully skill'd in choice of time. Bothwell and Ormond, nobly emulous To fathom the recesses of my heart, Have both their own, and thine, too much exposed. Ma. âIf reason could have influence o'er thy soul, Or wert thou in a state to hear it now, It would be easy here to explain the whole; To call them both together; and to hear ... Hen. I be confronted with such men as these? ... Ma. And how by any other means can I Convince thee of the truth? How from thine eyes Remove the bandage? Hen. 'Tis removed already: I see too clearly ... âyet would'st thou at once Convince me, and my apprehensions quell? To thee but one infallible resource Remains for this. From thee too I require The execrable head of haughty Bothwell; And Ormond's instant banishmentâWith this, Say, art thou ready to comply? Ma. At length I see, (alas, too evidently see!) To what thy wishes tend. Whoe'er he be That may communicate to me the truth, Is for that cause alone obnoxious to thee: He, be he who he may, in whom I trust, Becomes thy foe. Quickly, renew at once The massacre of Rizio: thou art used With thy own hands to execute thy vile And unjust vengeances. Thou may'st destroy, In the same generous, heroic guise, The life of Bothwell. To interdict thy crimes I have no power: reason forbids that I Should imitate thee in these bloody rites. Let Bothwell be condemned, if he is guilty; But let him first be heard. While I disdain not To subject e'en myself to the tribunal Of solemn, and irrefragable justice, E'en the most abject individual here Shall I dare subject to despotic power? Hen. Here guilty men can always challenge favour, While from the worthy justice stands aloof: See, what it is to reign.âI take my leave; Farewell. Ma. Ah! hear me ... Hen. I intend to pass In the allotted fortress this last night, Which I devote to anguish, not to sleep.â The invitation I accept; a dwelling, Which I am not constrain'd to share with thee, Is welcome to me, till to-morrow's dawn Beholds me far from thy abhorred city. I thought indeed e'en yet to excite in thee Some perturbation; but I fondly thought it.â Thy face is tranquil as thy heart is false. SCENE THE THIRD. Mary. Ma. âAh wretched me! ... Where am I? ... What, alas! Can I now do? ... What fury goads him on? ... Whence can these infamous suspicions rise? ... In what does he confide? ... In my despised, Yet, as he deems, my undiminished love? ... But, if he should attempt? ... Here he must stay ... If he departs from hence, he will excite, In every one he meets, hatred for me, Rather than pity for himself: Heaven knows That I no otherwise am culpable, Than that too much I loved him, and too little Discern'd him as he is. What will now say The impious sects, accustomed so long time To rail with bitterest calumnies against me? These every day increase in strength and numbers ... Perchance on these the unworthy Henry leans ... Doubts, difficulties, errors, dangers, fears, On all sides I discover. To resolve Is perilous; to hesitate is worse ... SCENE THE THIRD. Mary, Bothwell. Ma. Bothwell, approach: if thou with thy advice Canst not alleviate my distracted state, Perchance I stand upon the very brink Of a tremendous precipice. Both. Alas! Long hast thou stood there; but now more than ever ... Ma. And what? With Henry's thoughts art thou acquainted? ... Both. I know the deeds of Henry. But, oh queen, Say have I e'er presumed to approach thy presence The accuser of another, much less then Of him who is thy husband? Yet to-day Necessity compels me e'en to this. Ma. Then plots have been contrived? ... Both. Contrived, say'st thou? They had e'en now, had Bothwell not been here, Been executed. Thou art well aware That I suggested how much it behoved To watch o'er Henry unremittingly, And learn the real cause of his return: But, ere 'twas long, of all his purposes I gain'd a full discovery. Ormond sought A private audience; tamper'd with his faith; With flatteries and promises assail'd him: Then dared he to propose to him, and gain'd, That he should yield to him thy son ... Ma. My son! To Ormond! ... Both. Yes; that he might bear him hence; And at once place him in the English court. Ma. Ah traitor! ... Thus despoil me of my son? ... And yield him to her hands? ... Both. A recompence For this his treachery, Henry covenants That he exclusively should rule this realm. He thence designs to dictate laws to thee, To trample more and more beneath his feet The sacred rites of Rome, and to devote (Unnatural father!) everlastingly His own son to perdition ... Ma. Say no more. With horror am I stricken! ... And erewhile He had so much audacity, that he Himself to me imputed all the guilt Of this abominable artifice.â He said that Ormond was impell'd by me To execute this project; that such snares Were all of my contrivance: base accuser! Both. He had recourse to subterfuge with thee, Fearing that thou his treachery hadst discover'd. I erewhile, in thy name, presumed to try Dissuasive arguments: for such a fault He sought to excuse himself, but found no means: He cannot, nor knows how to contradict it: Hence he burst forth in such immoderate rage That what at first in me was mere surmise, Became conviction. I to Ormond ran; And the weak judgment, the precarious faith, The irresolution, the inconstancy Of Henry I display'd to him; and feign'd That that same Henry had incautiously To me, in part, the stratagem divulged. Ormond, although well versed in courtly arts, Yet thought himself betray'd, and suddenly Changing his views, denied it not to me; Yet he asserted Henry was the first To counsel him to seize the child; that he Quickly determined to reveal to thee The whole of this design: and that he feign'd With him, expressly for this purpose only, To consent to it. Then I also feign'd To yield to him full credence; and at length So far prevail'd on him, that he himself Now comes to thee with a sincere confession Of every thing that happen'd. Wilt thou hear him? He waits thy summons ... Ma. Let him come, and quickly. SCENE THE FOURTH. Mary. Ma. My son! ... What have I heard? ... my son surrender'd To that most cruel, envious, crafty queen! And who surrenders him to her? His father; His very father thus betrays his blood, His honour, and himself! Was there, alas! Such guilt e'er found united in one man With such infatuation? SCENE THE FIFTH. Mary, Bothwell, Ormond. Ma. Speak the truth; Confess what Henry said to thee. Or. He ... yes ... He bitterly deplored the disesteem In which all hold him here. Ma. It is not now The time to soften down his words. The mask Take off; confess to me his rash proposals, And thy rash promises. Or. 'Tis true ... that he ... Sought ... to obtain of me, ... in his behalf, ... The interference ... of Elizabeth. Ma. Now by sincerity alone thou canst Defend thyself. I know the whole affair. What boots concealment? 'Twere in vain for thee To seek to elude confession. In the event, Henry himself, as cautious in performing, As in contriving projects, had betray'd Himself, and Ormond, and Elizabeth: But from thy lips I fain would hear the truth. Or. Henry complain'd to me that in these walls His offspring, destined for a double realm, Was train'd perniciously: hence he himself Determined to surrender him in hostage To Elizabeth, a pledge of his good faith ... Ma. Oh unexampled father! And didst thou Consent to this? Or. ... By a direct refusal I would not quench his hopes too suddenly ... I feign'd consent, to learn his further purpose ... Ma. Let this suffice; no more. Elizabeth, The artificer of fraudulent designs, Hither dispatch'd thee: but, as I conceive, Of fraudulent designs more subtly plann'd. Retire now; that which on thy own account Thou dost not merit, to thy rank I yield. Elizabeth meanwhile shall learn from me, That an ambassador to me is due, More dexterous at least, if not more faithful. SCENE THE SIXTH. Mary, Bothwell. Both. There's art, but mistimed art, in all his words. 'Twixt truth and lies how clumsily he shuffles! 'Tis well that he's found out in time. Ma. I find not in me in this hour of need Or strength to act, or wisdom to explore: By doubts, by anger, and by fear, at once I feel my heart as if asunder torn; And, would'st thou think it? still that heart retains I know not what of hope ... Both. And I too hope, That now, since the discover'd plot's defeated, No others lurk behind it. Ma. Be it so. Yet such is he, that now that he perceives His foolish enterprize discover'd ... Both. He! ... What can he do? Ma. He may forsake my realm. His cruel, last farewell, already he ... Both. Forsake thy realm!âEven before 'twas known, This new aggression, thou didst interdict With justice such a step: more just would be That interdiction now; now that perchance, As an atonement for his frustrate schemes, Others he would devise in foreign climes With more successful boldness. Ma. 'Tis most just: I oft have thought of this; but yet ... Both. Who knows Where his malignant steps might carry him? Who knows what succour he might dare solicit? ... He would obtain it; yes, too certainly In others' rancour he would surely find A firm alliance.âThou should'st now select The lesser evil ... Ma. But what may that be? Both. Better than I thou know'st it. But to have Recourse to violence shocks thy noble heart ... Yet, what would'st thou? Would'st thou that Henry find Protection from Elizabeth? If he In person treat with her, far other plots ... Ma. Oh fatal day! and perhaps the harbinger Of others still more fatal! Is it true That thou at length art come? ... Disastrous day! And apprehended long! ... Ah wretched me! 'Gainst him who heretofore has shared my love, Who shared the fondest wishes of my heart, Shall I use violence? ... I cannot do it ... And, come what may come, I can never do it. Both. But think how deeply he may injure thee? ... Ma. What injury can he inflict, that equals The loss of his affection? Both. Should he once Make good his flight from hence, assuredly Thou ne'er would'st see him more ... Ma. Oh heaven forbid! May I not lose him quite ... Both. And dost thou not, Much as thy husband, love thy son, oh mother? That son is now in everlasting danger; Death of the soul, the only real death, Errors corrupting and heretical, Await, thou know'st, his youthful innocence. Mary. Assuredly I ought ... but how, alas! ... Both. If Henry's liberty were somewhat lessen'd, Or round his sacred royal person placed Some slight impediments to its abuse ... Ma. He's too impatient of controul already: Remorse, disgrace, and turbulent despair, Might make him still more headstrong than he is, And all my faithless and rebellious subjects Would be his partizans. Both. I now perceive One means by which thou may'st accomplish this, And yet excite no tumult. One, no more.â The night descends: surround with armed men Amid its shades, the hill, where singly towers His royal dwelling. There is he ere now Retired, to wait there for the dawn of day, And then depart from thence: he has with him There a few obscure friends. There he may stay, Courteously guarded: no one will attempt Thus to lay hands on him; and thus at once Thou mak'st his rage abortive. Through this night No man to him can penetrate: to-morrow To thy just arguments for this allow Free circulation; and to him allow Permission to impugn them if he can. Ma. This seems the safest plan; but yet ... Both. Ah! think, Thou hast no other. Ma. But, in the execution ... Both. I will take care of that, if thou desirest. Ma. But should perchance the orders be exceeded? ... Be on thy guard ... Both. What dost thou apprehend? That I'm incompetent to the execution? But, ere we miss the occasion, time is short; I fly ... Ma. Ah no; ... stay here ... Both. For once, at least, I will use violence with thee: recollect, I saved thee once before ... Ma. I know it; but ... Both. Confide in me. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Mary. Ma. Ah! no ... Suspend ... He flies. Oh fatal and irrevocable moment! Upon a thread my peace and fame now hang.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Mary, Murray. Mur. Laying aside all ceremonious forms, Anxious and breathless, I presume to come, At an unusual hour, to thy apartments. Oh what a night is this! Ma. What would'st thou now? Mur. What hast thou done? Who thus has counsell'd thee? In the recesses of thy palace now Canst thou securely sit, while armed men And military cries surround thy consort? Ma. But whence this boldness in thee? ... All will see To-morrow that I've robb'd him of no power, Except the power of injuring himself. Mur. Whate'er the motive, the effect is monstrous, 'Tis cruel, terrible, and unexampled; And far more raises fury in the people Than strikes them with alarm. Now, well reflect: There are perhaps who deceive thee: perhaps I come In time to re-enlighten thee. To us, From guilty satellites that inundate All quarters of the city, in their hands Bearing lugubrious torches and drawn swords, Mischief alone can rise. What do these troops Around the rock where stands the royal dwelling, Rank'd in a circle, with ferocious looks Keeping each man at distance? Ma. For my deeds Am I accountable to thee? Correct Are my designs. They shall be known to those Who ought to know them. Dost thou place thy trust In the audacious people? Mur. In myself I trust alone, and in that God of truth Of whom I am the minister. From me Life thou may'st take, but not sincerity, And free and lofty speech ... Beside thy spouse Destroy me if thou wilt; but hear me first. Ma. What words are these? oh heavens! ... and do I wish My husband's blood? and who with this can charge me? ... Mur. Oh spectacle of woe!âThe unwarlike stag Pants in the bloody and ferocious claws Of the infuriate tygress ... See, already She tears him piecemeal ... Tremulous he falls, He dies, ... and was ... Ah! who forbears from weeping? âOh flash of lightning! What eternal ray Bursts on my dazzled sight? Mortal I am!â The dense and horrible clouds, that, in their womb Of pitchy blackness, hold the future buried, Behold, in volumes of sulphureous smoke They roll away, and rapidly they vanish ... What do I see? I see, ah yes, that traitor Reeking with blood-drops yet. Perfidious traitor! Reeking with sacred and tremendous blood, Thou liest in the widow'd bed yet warm! Ah, impious lady! canst thou suffer this? ... Ma. What voice is that? What accents do I hear? Oh heaven! what saidst thou? ... Presages of terror ... He hears me not; an unaccustomed flame Burns in his rolling eye-balls ... Mur. Even now, Thou second Ahab's daughter, do I hear The horrid howlings; I already see The bloody jaws of the infuriate dogs, By whom thy impure entrails shall be torn.â But thou, who sit'st upon the usurp'd throne, Son of iniquity! liv'st thou and reignest? Ma. His bosom labours with a threatening God! ... Oh heaven! ah! hear me ... Mur. No, thou livest not: Behold the scythe appointed to mow down The impious harvest. Death, I hear thy shriek, And thy invisible approach I feel. Oh vengeance of my God! of every crime How dost thou take account! ... Heaven triumphs: see, See the perfidious Jezebel is torn E'en from the arms of her adulterous husband ... Behold the traitors are betray'd ... Oh joy! They are dissever'd ... lacerated ... slain. Ma. Thou mak'st me tremble ... Ah! ... of whom speak'st thou? ... I faint ... Mur. But what new sight? ... Oh gloomy scene! Around a dismal scaffold I behold Sable and sanguinary ornaments! ... And who is this preparing to ascend it? Oh! art thou she? Dost thou, so proud and dainty, Bend to the cleaving axe thy lofty neck? Another sceptred dame inflicts on thee The mighty blow. The faithless blood spouts forth; And lo, a thirsty spectre drinks it all To the last drop!âAh! would the angry heavens Be satisfied with this? But, comet-like, Thou drawest after thee a fatal track; A race of wretched, proud, and abject kings Spring from the womb of the expiring lady. The just and horribly avenging ire Of heaven's Almighty Monarch runs transfused E'en with their life-blood ... Ma. ... Wretched that I am! ... What light, oh minister of heaven, inspires thee? Ah! cease ... ah! cease ... I die ... Mur. Who calls me now? ... In vain from my affrighted eyes would'st thou Chace this tremendous sight ... I see already In the thick gloom the sceptred spectres throng.â Oh! who art thou, that almost mak'st me shed Tears of compassion? ... Ah! above thy head The axe is lifted: now, alas! it falls. I see thy sever'd and thy once-crown'd head Roll'd in the dust! ... And art thou unavenged? ... Alas! thou art: For thy distinguish'd head Long had been due to a more ancient vengeance.â How many lesser royal shades I see Fight, fear, retreat, discomfited, in turns! Oh lineage, fatal as thou art to others, Destructive to thyself! For thee the streams Are dyed in blood ... And dost thou merit it? Ah, fly thou, to contaminate no more This region with thy footsteps: go, and seek, E'en in the breast of ignominy seek, Connatural refuge: with idolaters, Thy fit companions, herd: there drag along, The throne's disgrace, the laughing-stock of men, Scorn'd e'en in wretchedness, opprobrious days. Ma. What do I hear? ... Alas! ... what unknown power Have thy prophetic accents o'er my heart! Mur. Oh lofty transports of my troubled mind, Of rapt imagination, of my full, My labouring, yet illuminated spirit, Whither have ye impell'd me? ... What inspired? ... Where have ye led me? ... What have I beheld? ... To whom have spoken? ... Am I in the palace? ... The palace! ... Oh abode of grief and death, I fly from thee for ever. Ma. Stop ... Mur. Oh lady, Say, hast thou changed thy purpose? Ma. Wretched me! ... I scarcely seem to breathe ... must I then give Means to my foes to injure me? Mur. No, thou Should'st take the means of injuring from others; But first discover who it is that injures. For thy excuse I'm willing to believe That Bothwell is not fully known to thee: Such of that miscreant are the enormities, That they were e'en sufficient to appal The world's most harden'd profligates. Ma. Oh heaven! Should he betray me! Yet 'twere best to doubtâ Then go to Henry instantly thyself, And in my name, let Argyle be thy guide. Provided that he promises on oath Not to depart from Scotland till 'twixt us Our mutual variances are cleared, I swear, Ere morn, of all my troops to rid the plain. Go, fly; obtain but this, and then return. SCENE THE SECOND. Mary. Ma. What fear oppresses me! Alas! ... if ever ... But am I guilty? Thou, who knowest all things, Knowest that I am notâYet in my heart I never had more horrible forebodings ... What can they mean? ... And from this Murray's lips What fulminating imprecations roll'd!â A night so pregnant with dismay as this I never knew till now ... SCENE THIRD. Mary, Bothwell. Ma. What hast thou done? Where hast thou dragg'd me? Say, is there yet time For reparation? Bid thy men disperse ... Both. What! hast thou once more changed thy sentiments? Ma. I never bade thee ... thou first dared'st ... Both. Yes, I dared propose to thee a gentler means, For the obtaining of thy end, than any That thou contrived'st: and thou gav'st to me The care of these, which I accepted. Now Henry has seen my squadrons; he has heard The name of Bothwell: to and fro he runs Along the galleries, and for desperate fight Prepares himself. Distinctly I beheld him, By the glare of lurid torches, come and go, Furiously chafe, and make parade of valour. The thunder of his menaces descends E'en to the plain. 'Twere easy to recall The troops; but who could afterwards appease The rage of Henry? Of myself I speak not: I were a trifling victim (if indeed I could suffice) in such a cause as this: But what would be thy fate? Henry incensed ... Ma. Ah speak, did Murray not this instant go From hence to Henry? ... Both. I beheld him notâ Say, has that lying demagogue again Conferr'd with thee? Ma. Ah yes, too certainly! ... Although the minister of a hostile sect, What has he not reveal'd to me? Oh heaven! Fatal prognostics from his lips I heard. Myself dispatch'd him as a messenger To my unyielding husband: may his words Avail, as they have penetrated mine, To penetrate his heart! Who knows? such means Oft has the invisible heavenly will elected: Perhaps Murray is his instrument. Go, run; See that the king speaks with him. Both. Murray, foe Of our religion, at his will aspires To sway the feeble mind of Henry; hence He feigns to be his friend. Arch-hypocrite! His only passion is to head a party. The most determined of the rebels stand Already arm'd; they want a man to raise The standard of revolt; and he will raise it. What are their schemes, thou knowest;âthou who, once Fall'n in their hands, heardest them dictate to thee Their haughty and injurious laws; and I, Who freed thee from them, too well recollect.â Now, while I breathe, I swear that thou shalt not Stoop to these men: to disobey thee now Is loyalty. All method of approach To every man is absolutely closed; And he who would attempt it, forfeits life. In vain the most devoted of thy friends Would there present himself; e'en in thy name In vain would Murray go there ... Ma. What! hast thou Ventured so far? ... Both. I dare, and I will save thee: I'm perfectly aware of what I do. If thou dost not now openly convict Henry of guilt, since thou hast offer'd him An open insult, thou thyself art ruin'd. Ma. Let come what may come: I had rather die Than bring a blot upon my fame ... obey; Thy overweening zeal may injure me: Then quickly go, and bid the bands disperse ... But what do I behold? ... What horrid blaze! ... Ah! ... what a crash! Trembles the opening earth ... Both. Oh! ... from the bursting clouds devouring flames Descend from heaven! Ma. The opening doors fly back ... Both. Oh! what a roaring in the smoky air! Ma. Ah! whither shall I fly? ... SCENE THE FOURTH. Murray, Mary, Bothwell. Mur. Where canst thou fly? Ma. Murray! ... what means it? ... Thou ... return'st already? Mur. And art thou here? Go, see thy murder'd husband! ... Ma. Alas! ... what do I hear? ... Both. Murder'd! and how? By whom? Mur. Miscreant! by thee! Both. What dar'st thou say? ... Ma. Oh heaven! is Henry slain? ... But how? ... I heard The terrible report! ... Mur. But ... thou art safe. The house is blown up where thy husband sleeps, Even from its foundation! He has found A horrible tomb amid its ghastly ruins! Ma. What is it that I hear? ... Both. Assuredly, Henry himself, to the collected powder Stored mid-way up the hill, in desperate fit Set fire. Mur. Thee, Bothwell, every one proclaims Thee, traitor. Ma. Sacrilegious! hast thou dared? ... Both. Behold my head; 'tis forfeited at once To him that proves me guilty of this deed. I ask no favour at thy hand, oh queen; But strict, entire, and expeditious justice. Mur. Himself he slew not. Base malecontents slew him ... Ma. Oh horrible suspicion! Pang far worse Than that of any death! ... Eternal blot! ... Oh cruel grief! ... âNow quickly from my eyes Let each withdraw. The truth shall be discover'd; And let him tremble, whosoe'er he be, The atrocious author of a deed like this. For vengeance now, and nothing else, I live. Both. Oh queen, thy sorrow I indeed respect; But for myself I tremble not. Mur. Alas! Hast thou a cause to tremble?âOn this spot, Till heaven's avenging thunderbolt is hurl'd, The guiltless only have just cause of fear.</field>
