      <field name="fulltext">Londini Emporia, OR Londons Mercatura. Exprest in sundry Triumphs, Pageants and Showes, at the Inauguration of the Right Honorable Ralph Freeman into the Maiorty of the Famous and farre Renowned Citty London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">? Redeunt Spectacula, ?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Right Honourable Ralph Freeman, Lord Maior of this Renowned Metropolis London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mercatura, i. Merchandise, the Greekes call Emporia, and Emporos a Merchant, the Hebrewes Meker. From hence (it seemes) the Poets call Hermes (the Sonne of Iupiter and Maia) Mercury, making him the God of Merchants and Merchandise. The mistery whereof hath in the ancient times beene held glorious, and the professors thereof illustrious as those, by whose Aduenture and Industry vnknowne Countries haue beene discouered, Friendship with forreigne Princes contracted, barbarous Nations to humane gentlenesse and courtesie reduced, and all such vsefull commodities in forreigne Climats abounding, and in their owne wanting, made conducible and frequent, nay, many of them haue not beene onely the Erectors of braue and goodly structures, but the Founders of great and famous Cities: (for so sayth Plutarch in Solon) Merchandise it selfe, according to Aristotle, consisteth of three things, Nauigation, FÅneration, and Negotiation, all which are commendably approued, if considerately and conscionably vsed. Eight Offices of Piety are in a Merchant required. 1. Rectitudo conscientiÃ¦, Vprightnesse of Conscience, which is most acceptable to the Creator, (and therefore ought to be more prized by the Creature) then any vaine-glorious Title: as stiled by our best Theologists, the indulgent Mother of all Vertues whatsoeuer. 2. Simulationis &amp; dissimulationis seclusio, i. A seclusion or separation from all dissembling or equivocation. 3. Fraudem deuitare, i. To abandon all fraud or deceite in bargaining, but in all Couenants and Contracts to obserue truth and irreprooueable fidelity. 4. Iustitiam exerceri, i. To exercise Iustice: which excludeth the practice of Iniury, Extortion, and Oppression. 5. Superbiam deponere, To lay by all pride, for (as diuine Plato sayth) Hee who knoweth himselfe best, esteemeth of himselfe the least: Wee reade also in Socrates, that pride is a vice which of young men ought to be carefully auoided, of old men vtterly abiured, of all men suspected and feared. 6. Beneficientia vti, i. Out of his abundance to bee open-handed vnto all, but especially vnto the poore and indigent. 7. Auaritiam frÅnare, i. To bridle the insatiate desire of getting, for the auaritious man wanteth as well what he hath, as what he hath not: who hath great trauaile in gathering Wealth, more danger in keeping it, much Law in defending it, most torment in departing from it. 8. Sollicitudines resecare, i. To renounce all care and trouble of minde, which may hinder Diuine contemplation, but rather to fixe his thoughts vpon that Heauenly treasure which the Moath corrupteth not, the Fire cannot waste, nor the Sea wracke: All these things desireable being knowne to be eminent in your Lordship, was the maine inducement to intitle this present Show by this apt Denomination, Londini Emporia: Further of Merchants we reade Horace thus, Itorat. lib. I. Epist. I. Impiger extremos currit Mercator ad Indos, Per mare pauperiem fugiens, per saxa per ignes. The Merchant to the farthest Indies flies, Through seas, rockes, fires, lest Want should him surprise. Concerning this Company of the Cloath-workers, none hath beene more ancient, as claiming their place from the first institution, and though in count the last of Twelue, yet eueryway equall with the first or any: the reasons are pregnant, and briefely these: The Nobility of the Land are called Pares, (that is) Peeres. For their parity and equality, as hauing preualent voyces in the high Session, or Court of Parliament. The two famous Vniuersities are equall Sisters: neyther can one claime priority aboue the other, yet because they cannot be named at once, those of Cambridge say, Cambridge and Oxford: Those of Oxford say, Oxford and Cambridge, which neither addeth nor detracteth from the other: In all numbers there is a compulsiue necessity of order, onely for method sake, not that we can properly say, this Figure in it selfe is better then that, being all of them onely helpers to make vp an Account: since that all the Lord Maiors of this honourable City: (from which of the Twelue Companies soeuer they be Elected) beare one Sword, receiue one Power, and retaine like Authority: (There being no difference at all in place, office, or in granting Priuiledges or Immunities &amp;c.) I hold them all equall without difference, or if any shall claime priority or precedence aboue the rest, let it bee conferr'd vpon that which breedeth the best Magistrates, and of this Company haue beene these after named, not of the least Eminence, as Sir William Hart, L. Maior Anno 1559. Sir Rowland Hayward An. 1570. who was twice L. Maior at the least. Sir Iames Howell An. 1574. Sir Edward Osborne An. 1583. Thomas Skinner, who dyed before hee was Knighted, 1596. Sir Iohn Spencer An. 1594. Sir Michael Moseley 1599. Sir Iohn Watts 1606. And now this present yeare 1633. the Right Honourable Ralph Freeman: Neyther is it the least Honour to this right Worshipfull Fraternity, that it pleased Royall King Iames, (of sacred memory) besides diuers others of the Nobility, to enter into the freedome and brother-hood of this Company.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I come now to the first show by water which is a Sea-chariot, The first Show by water. beautified and adorned with shel-fishes of sundry fashion and splendor, the Fabricke it selfe being visible to all, needeth not any expression from me. This Chariot of no vsuall forme or figure, is drawne by two Griffons. (The supporters to the Armes of this Worshipfull Company: Those which ride vpon these commixt Birds and Beasts bearing staues with pendants falling from their tops, in which are portray'd the Armes of the two Sheriffes now in place: The speaker is Thamesis, or the Genius of the Riuer Thames, increased to this nauigable depth by the meeting of the Tame and Isis, he being seated in the front of the Chariot with his water Nymphes clad in seuerall colours about him, seemeth asleepe, but at the approach of the Lord Maiors Barge, he rowzeth himselfe as being newly wakend from a Dreame, and speaketh as followeth. The Speech by Water. Can Thamesis himselfe so farre forget? But 'tis so long since Tame and Isis met, That 'tis not rare; for we two are growne old, And being Riuers, subiect to take cold: Forc't with extremity of paine to grone, As troubled with the grauell and the stone. The Riuer (at this) timee clining by sundry water-engines. (Whole shelues are in our raines) but (Fates so please) By Artists helpe me late haue got some ease. Thankes to our Patriots: O when I looke On you, I must acknowledge to a Brooke My Riuer had beene turn'd, had not your care Beene euer studious for our best well-fare. (My recollection helpe me) you are hee That vp to Stanes and downe as farre as Lee, Are my great Lord in cheife; first then I bow. To Stanes vpward and downe to Lee, the L. Maior commandeth the Thames. To your Inauguration, and I now Rowse me in my Sea Chariot, drawne or led By your owne Griffons: Birds, who haue the head Of Eagles, Lyons body, wings beside, All Symboles of that PrÃ¦tor, who shall guide So great a state; know further, Griffons can Snatch from the Earth the harnest horse and man To pray on them at pleasure, these imply That you must alwayes haue an Eagles eye To out gaze the Sun, and keepe that Aquilant sight To see what's wrong, and to distinguish right. The Lyons strength and boldnes you must haue (With all his pitty,) for to such as craue Or yeeld vnto him, aining themselues dying, Scorning to kil, he will not touch them lying: But such as striue or shall oppugne his lawes, He rends and teares them with his Kingly pawes. The wings your Griffons beare, import what speede should be apply'd to such as iustice neede: But why should I though best of Neptunes sonnes (Whose streame almost by your permission runnes) Instruct him who can teach? since the last yeare Till this day, neuer ran my Tides so cleare As now they doe, were neuer so become With Barges, Ensignes; Trumpets, Fyfe and Drum, Me thinkes you make me yong againe to view Old customes kept, and (in them) all things new. Though I by name of Thamesis ame knowne My streames are yours, you welcome to your owne, Passe, and returne safe, thus much on we build, What's on my Waters wanting Land shall yeeld. The first Show by Land, Presenteth it selfe in Paules The first show by Land. Church-yard, which is a Shepheard grazing his flocke vpon an Hill adorned with seuerall Trees, and sundry sorts of Flowers, he sitteth vpon a Dyall to which his sheepe-hooke is the Gnomon, (a Symbole of his care and vigilancy,) vpon the same plat-forme where his Sheepe are resting in seuerall postures, appeareth a Woolfe ready to cease vpon his prey, at whose presence though his Dogge seeme terrified and flyes for refuge to his master, yet he stands ready at all houres with a bold spirit and wakefull eye, both for the defence of his charge and offence of the comon aduersary the Woolfe, which reflecteth vpon the office of the PrÃ¦tor this day Inaugurated wherein is exprest, not onely the care he ought to haue of his flocke, but of the profit also which ariseth from the fleece, from which the mistery of the Cloath-Workers deriueth its Originall. Pastor or Opilio in the Roman tongue, and in ours a Shepheard: the Hebrues call Roheh, from which some are of opinion Rex and Roy are deriued, the Greekes call him Poimin, which properly implyes Ouium pastor or a feeder of Sheepe: to which charge none ought to aspire who is not lawfully called, but this Shepheard entereth by the Dore which is the voyce of a free election, and is not that Mercinarius pastor of whom it is thus spoken, Hee seeth the Woolfe comming, and leaueth the Sheepe and flleeth, &amp;c. I shall not neede to swell my pages by reciting the sundry profits and emoluments arising from this most necessary Mistery, without which no Common. Weale were able to subsist, nor to reckon vp into how many seuerall Prouinces and Countries this c?modity of Cloath is transported and vended, nor what seuerall sorts of wares (by barter, and commerce) are in exchange of that brought ouer into our owne Kingdome, therefore to cut of circumstance, I proceede to the Shepheards Speech as followeth. The Shepheards Speech. If a true Shepheard you desire to see, Looke this way, for hee's embleam'd here in me: But you graue PrÃ¦tor rais'd to this high state, Hee whom as now I only personate The numerous throng, which you this day behold Are your owne Sheep, this Citty is their fold, And by your graue descretion they shal best, Know where to browze by day, by night to rest. As I, so you must on a Diall sit Which hath no Gnomon but my staffe to it, And such your Swoord is now, your wakefull eye Must still be ope to watch where you can spy The Rauenous Woolfe to presse, and block the way, Least hee on any of your Flocke should prey: Although my Dog fly from him, who hath binne Rent with his pawe, and feares his horrid grinne, Yet at all houres (you see) I ready stand With armed hart, and Sheepe-hooke in my hand, (So with your Swoord must you) both with an hye Vndaunted Spirit, and with a Vigilant eye, Least any enuious thorne, or schratching bryer, May race their Skinnes, or on their Fleeces tyer, And that your charge so carefully be borne They may be neuer But in Season shorne: Great reason too you haue, for by this Trade, (Of which Great Freeman, you first Free were made) The whole Land's Cloath, no Mistery, no Art, Science, or Manifacture, that hath part In Theory or Practick, but must all Giue due respect to this in generall: For since the Trade of Cloathing first begun, Both from the scorching of the sommers Sun, And blustering North-Winds, Rich, Poore, Young and Old Haue beene defenc'd, nor could that Fleece of Gold Colchos still boasts, (in the' Auncient Poets read So vsefull prooue, or make so fine a threed With ours, (low pris'd because not counted rare) No remote Climat's able to compare: It is that onely Marchandize which brings All nouels wanting heere, euen forreigne Kings Haue thought themselues Rich Habited to haue worne Such Cloath as for the commonnesse we scorne, Oh blesse then our increase, those that haue been I'th Worlds remote parts, and strange Nations seene, For want of Cloath find them goe naked there, Yet men like vs, and the same Image beare, Make much Sir of your great Charge, 'tis not mine, Y' are the true Shepheard, I my place resigne. The second Show by Land, presented in the vpper end The second show by Land. of Cheape-side, is a Ship most proper to the Trade of Merchant-aduenturers: neither know I whom more aptly to imploy as Pilot therein then Mercury, whom the Poets feigne not onely to be Diactorus, or Internuntius betwixt the gods and men: as also the Leader of the Graces, the Inuentor of Wrestling, the Deuiser of Letters, the Patron of Eloquence, &amp;c. (From whence hee hath sundry attributes and denominations conferr'd vpon him) but he is also termed the god of Barter, buying, selling, and commerce in all Merchandise whatsoeuer. Wee reade of two onely imployd by the gods in Embassie vnto men, namely, Iris and Mercury: The difference betwixt their imployments is, that Iris (for the most part commanded by Iuno, (as being her chiefe Attendant) and neuer by the rest of the gods, vnlesse to fore-tell Warre, Famine, Pestilence, or some strange Disaster: And Mercury was negotiated but in sports, pastimes, marriage Feasts, sollemne meetings, Showes, Ouations, Triumphs, spectacles of the like nature, and therefore more proper to this Dayes imployment. He is figured like a young man, fresh coloured and beardlesse: In his right hand holding a Golden Purse, in his left a CaduzcÃ¦us, (a Rod with two Snakes twined and internoded about it,) their Heads meeting at the top, and their Tayles at the bottome, which the Ãgyptians held to be an Embleame of Peace: and in ancient dayes Great men imployde in the affaires of State, or forreigne Embassies, boare such Staues, from whence they were called CaducÃ¦atores: Hee weares Wings vpon his Hat and Heeles, intimating his Celerity: and behinde him stands a Cocke, denoting his Vigilancy: so much for the person, I come now to his Speech. Mercuries Speech I Mercury, the Patrone of all Trade, Of Trafficke and Commerce, am this day made A speaker from the Gods: (for my quicke motion Can sayle as well vpon the Land as Ocean: And who the Merchant better can assure, Then Mercury, the Lord of Mercature? To you, this Day with state and power indow'd, Bowing to the Lord Maior. Whose winged Ships all forreigne Seas haue plow'd, And mauger, surge, gust, or tempestuous slawe Discouered what our Pole-starre neuer saw. They from cold Arctos to the burning Zone Haue washt their keeles to find out lands vnknowne. Crossing the Boreal and the Australl lynes, To view the set and rise of all the Signes. To you whose Factors in both Indies lye, The East and West: (all parts both farre and nye,) Virginia, New England, the Bromoothos and St. Christof. are parts of the West Indies.Who sometimes vp, then downe the Volga steere, To know in Musco what is cheape or deere: And what Hesperian Tagus can affoord, (To enrich this noble Island) take aboord. There's nothing the braue Persian can hold rare, But hither brought by your great Cost and Care. The potent Turke (although in faith aduerse) Is proud that he with England can commerce. What Genoua, Luca, Florence, Naples yeeldes, What growes, or's found through all the Latian fields. What is in China, Greece, or Ormous sold, (That Diamond worthy to be set in Gold.) For Norway, Danske, France, Spaine, the Netherlands, What's best in them, comes frequent to our hands. And for transportage of some surplus ware, (Our owne wants furnisht) what we best can spare. No rarity for profit or for pleasure, But brought to vs in an abundant measure. To this braue Isle, (by Neptune moated round) You giue a Wall; not fixt on any ground, But mouing 'tweene the Ocean and the Ayre, Which as you build, so yearely you repayre. And (though a woodden Fabricke) so well knit, That should inuasiue force once menace it With loud-voic't Thunder, mixt with Sulpherous flame, 'Twould sinke, or send them backe with feare and shame, Graue Sir, no other president you neede To follow now, then him whom you succeede: Next on your Motto thinke: so happy prooue, Let your trust be in him that reignes aboue. The third Show by Land, is a Modell deuised for sport The third Show by Land. to humour the throng, who come rather to see then to heare: And without some such intruded Anti-maske, many who carry their eares in their eyes, will not sticke to say, I will not giue a pinne for the Show. Since therefore it consists onely in motion, agitation and action, and these (expressed to the life) being apparently visible to all, in vaine should I imploy a speaker, where I presuppose all his words would be drown'd in noyse and laughter, I therefore passe to the fourth and last. Which is a curious and neately framed Architect, beautified The fourth Show by Land. with many proper and becomming Ornaments: bearing the Title of The Bower of Blisse. An Embleame of that future Happinesse, which not onely all iust and vpright Magistrates, but euery good man, of what condition or quality soeuer in the course of his life, especially aimeth at: I dwell not on the description thereof, I will onely illustrate the purpose for the which it was intended: This Pageant is adorned with foure persons, which represent the foure Cardinall vertues, which are behoouefull vnto all who enter into any eminent place or Office. Prudence, Temperance Iustice, and Fortitude, which are so concatinated amongst themselues that the one cannot subsist without the other. The first Prudence, Reformeth Abuses past, ordreth affaires present, and fore-seeth dangers future: Further (as Cicero obserues) Iustice without Prudence is resolu'd into Cruelty, Temperance into Fury, Fortitude into Tyranny. Next Temperance, which as Hermes sayth, is Rich in losses: Confident in perills, Prudent in assaults, and happy in it selfe. As a man cannot be Temporate vnlesse he be Prudent, so none can be truely valiant vnlesse he be Temperate, neyther can Iustice exist without Temperanceâ since no man can be truely iust, who hath not his brest free from all purturbations. Then Iustice (which according to Cicero) is the badge of Vertue, the staffe of Peace, the maintenance of Honour. Moreouer, Iustice and Order are the preseruers of the Worlds peace, the iust, Magistrate is in his word Faithfull, in his thought sincere, in his heart Vpright, without feare of any but God and his Prince, without hate of any but the wicked and irregular. Last Fortitude, which (as Epictetus obserues) is the companion of Iustice, and neuer contendeth but in Rrighteous Actions, it contemneth Perill, despiseth Calamities, and conquers Death, briefely Fortitude without Prudence is but Rashnes, Prudence without Iustice is but Graftines, Iustice without Temperancs but Tyrany, Temperance without Fortitude but Folly. Amongst the rest of the Persons placed in this structure, are the three Theologicall Vertues, Faith, Hope, and Charity, as hand-maides attending to conduct all such pious and religious Magistrates, the way to the cÃ¦lestiall Bower of Blisse, (of which this is but a meere representation and signe) who ayme at that Glorious Place, least they anyway deuiate from the true path that leadeth vnto it. I proceede to the Speech. Prudence the Speaker. Graue PrÃ¦tor, with your Censors, (Sheriffes elected, And now in place) it is from you expected, That hauing your Authority from Kings, (And many hundred yeares since) all such things As Custome (by Time strengthned) hath made good, You should maintaine, withall your liuelyhood, Which that you will performe, we doubt the lesse. When we consider who's your patronesse, The Holy and blest Virgin, (further) this Fabricke before you plac't, The Bower of blisse. If we to greater, lesse things may compare These present, but the petty Symbols are Of what is future; for bare Prudence here Pent and confin'd in humane knowledge, there Shall be reduc't to Wisedome that's Diuine. Temperance (which is bare Abstinence) shall shine In clarity immaculate: Iustice, which Oft swayes the Ballance so, that to the Rich It most inclines, shall by an equall Scale, (Leaning nor this, nor that way) so preuaile, That Right in glorious Star-wreaths shalbe crown'd, And Iniury in tenebrous Lethe drownd. Braue Fortitude which chiefely doth subsist In opposition of the Antigonist, (Whether that hee the Bodies mortall state Seeke to supplant, or Soule insidiate) Shall stand impugnable, and thenceforth be Fin'd and repur'd to all Eternity: When you arriue at yon CÃ¦lestiall Tower, Which aptly may be titled Freemans Bower. The way to finde which, through these vertues lies Call'd Cardinall: The stepps by which to rise, These Graces shewe, Faith, Hope, and Loue attend you: Who on their vnseene wings shall soone ascend you. These (when all Earths pompe failes) your prayers shal bring Where Saints and Angels Haleluiahs sing. I cannot without iust taxation of ingratitude, omit to speake something of this Worshipfull company of the Cloath-Workers, at whose sole charge the Tryumphs of this day were celebrated, for the Master the Wardens and the Committi, chosen to see all things accomodated for this busines then in motion, I cannot but much commend both for their affabillity and courtesie, especially vnto my selfe being at that time to them all a meere stranger, who when I read my (then vnperfect) Papers, were as able to iudge of them, as attentiuely to heare them, and rather iudicially considering all things, then nicely carping at any thing, as willing to haue them furthered for his honour, to whom they are dedicate, as carefull to see them performed to their owne reputation and credit, in both which, there was wanting in them neyther incouragement nor bounty: and as they were vnwilling in any vaine glory to shew new presidents to such that should succeede them, so they were loath out of parsimony to come short of any who went before them, lesse I could not speake in modesty, and more I forbeare to vtter least I might incurre the imputation of flattery, I come now to the twelue celestiall Signes, which may aptly be applied vnto the twelue Moneths during the Lord Mayors gouernment. The Speech at Night. Sleepe may you soundly Sir, to morrow prest To a yeares trouble for this one nights rest, In which may Starres and Planits all conspire, To warme you so by their celestiall Fire Aries whose Gold-Fleece Greece doth so renowne May both inrich you and this Glorious towne, That Taurus in your strength may so appeare, You this great at wieght may on your Shoulders beare: That the two Twins the Mothers blest increase, May in this Citty still continue peace. That Cancer who incites to hate and spleene May not in your faire Gouernment be seene That Leo waiting on your iudgement seate May moderate his rage and scorching heate, That the Celestiall Maide may you aduice Virgins and Orphans still to patronize And rather then your iustice heere should faile, Libra no more be seene with Golden scale And that the Scorpions sting may be so charm'd The poore may not be wrong'd, nor innocent harm'd, Sagittarius That Chirons bent bow so may guide your will, You may still aime, but neuer shoot to kill: And Capricorne though all things said to dare Though he haue power, yet may haue will to spare That as Aquarius doth his water power You may your goodnes on this Citty shower, Pisces, the last of Twelue, the Feete they guide, From Head to Foot, O may you so prouide. I conclude with the excellent Artist Mr. Gerald Chrismas, whose worth being not to be questioned (as a prime Master in his profession,) I am of opinion that there is not any about the towne who can goe beyond him, of whom I may boldly speake, that as Art is an helpe to nature, so his experience is, and hath beene an extention to the tryall and perfection of Art, therefore let euery man in his way striue to be eminent, according to that of Ouid. 2 De pont.</field>
