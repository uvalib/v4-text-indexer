      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, The City of Babylon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Subject of this Drama is taken from the Sixth Chapter of the Book of the Prophet Daniel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART I. PHARNACES, SORANUS. PHARNACES. Yes!âI have noted, with a jealous eye, The pow'r of this new fav'rite! Daniel reigns, And not Darius! Daniel guides the springs Which move this mighty empire! High he sits, Supreme in favour both with prince and people! Where is the spirit of our Median lords, Tamely to crouch and bend the supple knee To this new god? By Mithras, 'tis too much! Shall great Arbaces' race to Daniel bow? A foreigner, a Hebrew, and a slave? Something must be devis'd, and that right soon, To shake his credit. SORANUS. Rather hope to shake The mountain pine, whose twisting fibres clasp The earth, deep rooted! Rather hope to shake The Scythian Taurus from his central base! NoâDaniel sits too absolute in pow'r, Too firm in favour, for the keenest shaft Of nicely-aiming jealousy to reach him. PHARNACES. Rather he sits too high to sit securely. Hast thou then liv'd in courts? hast thou grown grey Beneath the mask a subtil statesman wears To hide his secret soul, and dost not know That, of all fickle Fortune's transient gifts, Favour is most deceitful? 'Tis a beam Which darts uncertain brightness for a moment! The faint, precarious, sickly shine of pow'r; Giv'n without merit, by caprice withdrawn. No trifle is so small as what obtains, Save that which loses it. It is a breath Which hangs upon a smile! A look, a word, A frown, the air-built tow'r of favour shakes, And down the unsubstantial fabric falls! Darius, just and clement as he is, If I mistake not, may be wrought upon By prudent wiles, by Flattery's pleasant cup, Administer'd with caution. SORANUS. But the means? For Daniel's life (a foe must grant him that) Is so replete with goodness, so adorn'd With every virtue, so exactly squar'd By wisdom's nicest rules, that 'twere most hard To charge him with the shadow of offence. Pure is his fame, as Scythia's mountain snows, When not a breath pollutes them! O Pharnaces! I've scann'd the actions of his daily life With all th' industrious malice of a foe; And nothing meets mine eye but deeds of honour! In office pure; for equitable acts Renown'd: In justice and impartial truth, The Grecian Themis is not more severe. PHARNACES. By yon' bright sun, thou blazon'st forth his praise, As if with rapture thou didst read the page Where these fair deeds are written! SORANUS. Thou mistak'st. I only meant to shew what cause we have To hate and fear him. I but meant to paint His popular virtues, and his dang'rous merit. Then for devotion, and religious zeal, Who so renown'd as Daniel? Of his law Observant in th' extreme. Thrice ev'ry day With prostrate rev'rence he adores his God: With superstitious awe his face he turns Tow'rds his belov'd Jerusalem, as if Some local, partial God might there be found To hear his supplication. No affair Of state; no business so importunate; No pleasure so alluring; no employ Of such high import, to seduce his zeal From this observance due! PHARNACES. There, there he falls! Enough, my friend! His piety destroys him. There, at the very footstool of his God, Where he implores protection, there I'll crush him! SORANUS. What means Pharnaces? PHARNACES. Ask not what I mean! The new idea floating in my brain, Has yet receiv'd no form. 'Tis yet too soon To give it body, circumstance, or breath. The seeds of mighty deeds are lab'ring here, And struggling for a birth! 'Tis near the hour, The king is wont to summon us to council. E'er that, this big conception of my mind I'll shape to form and being. Thou, meanwhile, Convene our chosen friends; for I shall need The aid of all your counsels, and the weight Of grave authority. SORANUS. Who shall be trusted? PHARNACES. With our immediate motive, none, except A chosen band of friends, who most repine At Daniel's exaltation. But the scheme I meditate, must be disclos'd to all Who bear high office; all our Median rulers, Princes and captains, presidents and lords; All must assemble! 'Tis a common cause; All but the young Araspes, he inclines To Daniel and his God. He sits attent, With ravish'd ears, to listen to his lore: With rev'rence names Jerusalem, and reads The volume of the law! No more he bows, To hail the golden ruler of the Day; But looks for some great Prophet, greater far, So they pretend, than Mithras! From him, therefore, Conceal whate'er of injury is devis'd 'Gainst Daniel. Be it too thy care to-day, To keep him from the council. SORANUS. 'Tis well thought. 'Tis now about the hour of Daniel's pray'r, Araspes too is with him, and to-day They will not sit in council. Haste we then! Designs of high importance, once conceiv'd, Shou'd be accomplish'd. Genius to discern, And courage to atchieve, despise the aid Of ling'ring circumspection. The keen spirit Seizes the prompt occasion, and at once Plans and performs, resolves and executes!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. SCENE, Daniel's House. DANIEL, ARASPES. ARASPES. Proceed, proceed, thrice venerable sage! Enlighten my dark mind with this new ray, This dawning of salvation! Tell me more Of this expected King! this Prince of peace! This Promise of the nations! this great Hope Of anxious IsraÃ«l! This mighty Prophet! This Balm of Gilead, which shall heal the wounds Of universal nature! this Messiah! Redeemer, saviour, sufferer, victim, God! DANIEL. Enough to animate our faith, we know, But not enough to soothe the curious pride Of vain philosophy! Were all reveal'd, Hope wou'd have then no object, God no fear, And faith no exercise! Enough to cheer Our path we see, the rest is hid in clouds, And Heav'n's own shadows rest upon the veiw! ARASPES. Go on, blest Sage! I cou'd for ever hear, Untir'd, thy admonition! Tell me, how I shall obtain the favour of that God I but begin to know. DANIEL. By holy deeds, By deep humility, by faith unfeign'd. O Faith Hebrews, chap. xi., thou wonder-working principle! Eternal substance of our present hope, Thou evidence of things invisible! What cannot man sustain, sustain'd by thee? The time wou'd fail, and the bright star of day Wou'd quench his beams in ocean, and resign His empire to the silver queen of night; And she again descend the steep of heav'n, If I shou'd tell what wonders Faith atchiev'd, By Gideon, Barak, and the sapient seer, Elkanah's son; the pious Gileadite, Ill-fated Jephthah! He of Sampson, Zorah too, In strength unequall'd; and the shepherd-king, Who slew the giant of Gath! Why shou'd I tell Of holy Prophets, who, by conquering Faith, Wrought deeds incredible to mortal sense; Vanquish'd contending kingdoms, quell'd the rage Of furious pestilence, extinguish'd fire? Victorious Faith! others by thee endur'd Exile, disgrace, captivity, and death! Some, uncomplaining, bore (nor be it deem'd The meanest exercise of well-try'd Faith) The bitter taunts of undeserv'd reproach; Despising shame, that death to human pride! ARASPES. How shall this faith be sought? DANIEL. By earnest pray'r. Solicit first the wisdom from above; Wisdom Wisdom of Solomon, chap. vii., whose fruits are purity and peace! Wisdom! that bright intelligence, which sat Supreme, when with his golden See Paradise Lost, Book vii. l. 225; also Proverbs, chap. viii. ver. 27. compasses Th' Eternal plann'd the fabric of the world, Produc'd his fair idea into light, And said, that all was good! Wisdom, blest beam! The brightness of the everlasting light! The spotless mirror of the pow'r of God! The reflex image of th' all-perfect mind! A stream translucent, flowing from the source Of glory infinite; a cloudless light! Defilement cannot touch, nor sin pollute Her unstain'd purity! Not Ophir's gÃ²ld, Nor Ethiopia's gems can match her price! The diamond of the mine is pale before her! And, like the oil Elisha's bounty bless'd, She is a treasure which doth grow by use, And multiply by spending! She contains, Within herself, the sum of excellence. If riches are desir'd, wisdom is wealth! If prudence, where shall keen invention find Artificer more cunning? If renown, In her right-hand it comes! If piety, Are not her labours virtues? If the lore Which sage experience teaches, lo! she scans Antiquity's dark truths; the past she knows, Anticipates the future; not by arts Forbidden, of Chaldean sorcerer; But from the piercing ken of deep foreknowledge; From her sure science of the human heart; Weighing effects with causes, ends with means; And from the probable the certain forms, With palpable conjecture! ARASPES. Now, O Prophet! Explain the secret doubts which rack my mind, And my weak sense confound. Give me some line To sound the depths of Providence! O say, Why the ungodly prosper? why their root Shoots deep, and their thick branches flourish fair, Like the green bay tree? why the righteous man, Like tender plants, to shiv'ring winds expos'd, Is stripp'd and torn, in naked virtue bare, And nipp'd by cruel sorrow's biting blast? Explain, O Daniel! these mysterious ways, To my faint apprehension! For as yet I've much to learn. Fair Truth's immortal sun Is sometimes hid in clouds; not that her light Is in itself defective; but obscur'd By my weak prejudice, imperfect Faith, And all the thousand causes which obstruct The growth of virtue. DANIEL. Follow me, Araspes! Within, thou shalt pursue the sacred page, The book of Life eternal! there thou wilt see The end of the ungodly; thou wilt own How short their longest period; will perceive How black a night succeeds their brightest day! Weigh well this book; and may the Spirit of Grace, Who stamp'd the seal of truth on the bless'd page, Descend into thy soul, remove thy doubts, Clear the perplex'd, and solve the intricate, 'Till Faith be lost in sight, and Hope in joy!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. DARIUS on his throne. PHARNACES, SORANUS, PRINCES, PRESIDENTS, and COURTIERS. PHARNACES. O King Darius, live for ever! DARIUS. Welcome! Welcome, my princes, presidents and friends! Now tell me, has your wisdom ought devis'd To serve the common weal? In our new empire, Subdu'd Chaldea, is there ought remains Your prudence can suggest, to serve the state, To benefit the subject, to redress And raise the injur'd? to assist th' oppress'd, And humble the oppressor? If you know, Speak freely, princes! Wherefore am I king, Except to poise the awful scale of justice, With even hand; to minister to want, To bless the nations with a lib'ral rule, Vicegerent of th' eternal Oromasdes! PHARNACES. So absolute thy wisdom, mighty king! All counsel were superfluous. DARIUS. Hold, Pharnaces! No flatt'ry, prince, it is the death of virtue; Who gives it is of all mankind the lowest, Save he who takes it. Monarchs are but men; As feeble and as frail as those they rule, And born, like them, to die. The Lydian king, Unhappy CrÅsus! lately sat aloft, Almost above mortality; now see him, Sunk to the vile condition of a slave, He swells the train of Cyrus! I, like him, To mis'ry am obnoxious. See this throne; This very throne the great Nebuchadnezzar. Nebassar fill'd; Yet hence his pride expell'd him! Yonder wall, The dread terrific writing to the eyes Of proud Belshazzar shew'd; sad monuments Of Heav'n's tremendous vengeance! and shall I, Unwarn'd by such examples, cherish pride? Yet to their dire calamities I owe The brightest gem that glistens in my crown, Sage Daniel. If my speech have ought of worth, Or if my life with ought of good be grac'd, To him alone I owe it. SORANUS. [Aside to Pharnaces. Now, Pharnaces, Will he run o'er, and dwell upon his praise, As if we ne'er had heard it; nay, will swell The nauseous catalogue with many a virtue His own fond fancy coins. PHARNACES. O, great Darius! Let thine unworthy servant's words find grace, And meet acceptance in his royal ear, Who subjugates the East! Let not the king With anger hear my pray'r. DARIUS. Pharnaces, speak! I know thou lov'st me; I but meant to chide Thy flatt'ry, not reprove thee for thy zeal. Speak boldly, friends, as man shou'd speak to man. Perish the barb'rous maxims of the East, Which basely wou'd enslave the free-born mind, And plunder it of the best gift of Heav'n, Its liberty! PHARNACES. Then, O Darius, hear me! Thy princes, and the captains of thy bands, Thy presidents, the governors who rule Thy provinces, and I, thine humble creature, (Less than the least in merit, but in love, In zeal, and duty, equal with the first); We have devis'd a measure to confirm Thy infant empire; to establish here Thy pow'r with firm dominion, and secure Thy growing greatness past the pow'r of change. DARIUS. I am prepar'd to hear thee. Speak, Pharnaces! PHARNACES. The wretched Babylonians long have groan'd Beneath the rule of princes, weak or rash. The rod of pow'r was falsely sway'd alike, By feeble Merodach, and fierce Belshazzar. One let the slacken'd reins too loosely float Upon the people's neck, and lost his pow'r By nerveless relaxation. He who follow'd, Held with a tyrant's hand the cruel curb, And check'd the groaning nation till it bled. On diff'rent rocks they met one common ruin. Their edicts were irresolute, their laws Were feebly plann'd, their councils ill-advis'd; Now so relax'd, and now so overstrain'd, That the tir'd people, wearied with the weight They long have borne, will soon disdain controul, Tread on all rule, and spurn the hand that guides 'em. DARIUS. But say what remedy, Pharnaces? PHARNACES. Know that too, Thy servants have provided. Hitherto They bear the yoke submissive. But to fix Thy pow'r, and their obedience; to reduce All hearts to thy dominion, yet avoid Those deeds of cruelty thy nature starts atâ Thou shoud'st begin by some imperial act Of absolute dominion, yet unstain'd By ought of barbarous. For know, O king! Wholesome severity, if wisely rul'd With sober discipline, procures respect, More than the lenient counsels and weak measures Of frail irresolution. DARIUS. Now proceed To thy request. PHARNACES. Not I, but all request it. Be thy imperial edict issued strait, And let a firm decree be this day pass'd, Irrevocable, as our Median laws Ordain, that for the space of thirty days, No subject in thy realm shall ought request Of God, or man, except of thee, O king! DARIUS. Wherefore this strange decree? PHARNACES. 'Twill fix the crown With lasting safety on thy royal brow; And by a bloodless means preserve th' obedience Of this new empire. Think how much 'twill raise Thy high renown! 'Twill make thy name rever'd, And popular beyond example. What! To be as Heav'n, dispensing good and ill For thirty days! With thine own ears to hear Thy people's wants, with thine own lib'ral hands To bless thy suppliant subjects! O, Darius! Thou'lt seem as bounteous as a giving God! And reign in ev'ry heart in Babylon, As well as Media. What a glorious state, To be the blessed arbiter of good; The first efficient cause of happiness! To scatter mercies with a plenteous hand, And to be blest thyself in blessing others! DARIUS. Is this the gen'ral wish? [The Princes and Courtiers kneel. Chief PRESIDENT. Of one, of all. Behold thy princes, presidents, and lords, Thy counsellors, and captains! See, O king! [Presenting the Edict. Behold the instrument our zeal has drawn: The edict is prepar'd. We only wait The confirmation of thy gracious word, And thy imperial signet. DARIUS. Say, Pharnaces, What penalty awaits the man who dares Transgress our mandate? PHARNACES. Instant death, O king! This statute says, âShou'd any subject dare âPetition, for the space of thirty days, âOf God, or man, except of thee, O king! âHe shall be thrown into yon' dreadful den âOf hungry lions!â DARIUS. Hold! Methinks a deed Of such importance shou'd be wisely weigh'd. PHARNACES. We have revolv'd it, mighty king, with care, With closest scrutiny. DARIUS. I'm satisfy'd. Then to your wisdom I commit me, princes! Behold the royal signet, see, 'tis done! PHARNACES. [Aside. There Daniel fell! That signet seal'd his doom! DARIUS. [After a pause. Let me reflect!âSure I have been too rash! Why such intemperate haste? But you are wise; And wou'd not counsel this severe decree But for the wisest purpose. Yet, methinks, I might have weigh'd, and in my mind revolv'd This statute, e'er, the royal signet stamp'd, It had been past repeal! Sage Daniel too! My counsellor, my venerable friend, He shou'd have been consulted; for his wisdom I still have found oracular. PHARNACES. Mighty king! 'Tis as it shou'd be! The decree is past Irrevocable, as the stedfast law Of Mede and Persian, which can never change. Those who observe it live, as is most meet, High in thy grace; who violate it, die.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART IV. SCENE, Daniel's House. DANIEL, ARASPES. ARASPES. Oh, holy Daniel! prophet, father, friend! I come, the wretched messenger of ill! Thy foes complot thy death. For what can mean This new-made law, extorted from the king, Almost by force? What can it mean, O Daniel! But to involve thee in the toils they spread To snare thy precious life? DANIEL. How! was the king Consenting to this edict? ARASPES. They surpris'd His easy nature; took him when his heart Was soften'd by their blandishments! They wore The mask of public virtue to deceive him. Beneath the specious name of gen'ral good, They wrought him to their purposes: no time Allow'd him to delib'rate. One short hour, Another moment, and his soul had gain'd Her natural tone of virtue. DANIEL. That great Pow'r Who suffers evil, only to produce Some unseen good, permits that this shou'd be: And, he permitting, I, well pleas'd, resign! Retire, my friend! This is my second hour Of daily pray'r. Anon we'll meet again! Here, in the open face of that bright sun Thy fathers worshipp'd, will I offer up, As is my rule, petition to our God, For thee, for me, for Solyma, for all! ARASPES. Oh, stay! what mean'st thou! sure thou hast not heard The edict of the king? I thought, but now, Thou knew'st its purport. It expressly says, That no petition henceforth shall be made, For thirty days, save only to the king; Nor pray'r nor intercession shall be heard Of any God, or man, but of Darius. DANIEL. And think'st thou then my rev'rence for the king, Good as he is, shall tempt me to renounce My sworn allegiance to the King of kings? Hast thou commanded legions, tempted death In various shapes, and shrink'st at danger now? Come, learn of me; I'll teach thee to be bold, Tho' sword I never drew! Fear not, Araspes, The feeble vengeance of a mortal man, Whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein Is he to be accounted of? but fear The awaken'd vengeance of the living Lord; He who can plunge the everlasting soul In infinite perdition! ARASPES. Then, O Daniel! If thou persist to disobey the edict, Retire, and hide thee from the prying eyes Of busy malice! DANIEL. He who is asham'd To vindicate the honour of his God, Of him the living Lord shall be asham'd, When he shall judge the tribes! ARASPES. Yet, O remember, Oft have I heard thee say, the secret heart Is fair Devotion's Temple; there the saint, Ev'n on that living altar, lights the flame Of purest sacrifice, which burns unseen, Not unaccepted.âI remember too, When Syrian Naaman 2 Kings, chap. v., by Elisha's hand, Was cleans'd from foul pollution, and his mind, Enlighten'd by the miracle, confess'd The Almighty God of Jacob, that he deem'd it No flagrant violation of his faith, To bend at Rimmon's shrine; nor did the Seer Forbid the rite external. DANIEL. Know, Araspes, Heav'n deigns to suit our trials to our strength! A recent convert, feeble in his faith, Naaman, perhaps, had sunk beneath the weight Of so severe a duty. But shall I, Shall Daniel, shall the servant of the Lord, A vet'ran in his cause; one train'd to know, And do his will; one exercis'd in woe, Bred in captivity, and born to suffer; Shall I, from known, from certain duty shrink To shun a threaten'd danger? O, Araspes! Shall I, advanc'd in age, in zeal decline? Grow careless as I reach my journey's end? And slacken in my pace, the goal in view? Perish discretion, when it interferes With duty! Perish the safe policy Of human wit, where God's eternal name Is put in competition! Shall his law Be set at nought, that I may live at ease? How wou'd the heathen triumph, shou'd I fall Thro' coward fear! How wou'd God's enemies Insultingly blaspheme! ARASPES. Yet think a moment. DANIEL. No!â Where evil may be done, 'tis right to ponder; Where only suffer'd, know, the shortest pause Is much too long. Had great Darius paus'd, This ill had been prevented. But for me, Araspes! to deliberate is to sin. ARASPES. Think of thy pow'r, thy favour with Darius: Think of thy life's importance to the tribes, Scarce yet return'd in safety. Live! O, live! To serve the cause of God! DANIEL. God will sustain Himself his righteous cause. He knows to raise Fit instruments to serve him. As for me, The spacious earth holds not a bait to tempt me. What wou'd it profit me if I shou'd gain Imperial Ecbatan, th' extended land Of fruitful Media, nay, the world's wide round, If my eternal soul must be the price? Farewell, my friend! time presses. I have stol'n Some moments from my duty, to confirm, And strengthen thy young faith! Let us fulfil What Heav'n enjoins, and leave to Heav'n th' event!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART V. SCENE, The Palace. PHARNACES, SORANUS. PHARNACES. 'Tis done!âsuccess has crown'd our scheme, Soranus; And Daniel falls into the deep-laid toils Our prudence spread. SORANUS. That he shou'd fall so soon, Astonishes ev'n me! What! not a day, No, not a single moment to defer His rash devotions? Madly thus to rush On certain peril quite transcends belief! When happen'd it, Pharnaces? PHARNACES. On the instant: Scarce is the deed accomplish'd. As he made His ostentatious pray'r, ev'n in the face Of the bright God of day, all Babylon Beheld the insult offered to Darius. For, as in bold defiance of the law, His windows were not clos'd. Our chosen bands, Whom we had plac'd to note him, strait rush'd in, And seiz'd him in the warmth of his blind zeal, Ere half his pray'r was finish'd. Young Araspes, With all the wild extravagance of grief, Prays, weeps, and threatens. Daniel silent stands, With patient resignation, and prepares To follow them.âBut see! the king approaches! SORANUS. How's this? deep sorrow sits upon his brow! And stern resentment fires his angry eye! DARIUS, PHARNACES, SORANUS. DARIUS. O, deep-laid stratagem! O, artful wile! To take me unprepar'd! to wound my heart, Ev'n where it feels most tenderly, in friendship! To stab my fame! to hold me up a mark To future ages, for the perjur'd prince, Who slew the friend he lov'd! O Daniel! Daniel! Who now shall trust Darius? Not a slave Within my empire, from the Indian main To the cold Caspian, but is more at ease Than I, his monarch! I have done a deed Will blot my honour with eternal stain! Pharnaces! O, thou hoary sycophant! Thou wily politician! thou hast snar'd Thy unsuspecting master! PHARNACES. Great Darius! Let not resentment blind thy royal eyes. In what am I to blame? who cou'd foresee This obstinate resistance to the law? Who cou'd foresee that Daniel wou'd, perforce, Oppose the king's decree? DARIUS. Thou, thou foresaw'st it! Thou knew'st his righteous soul wou'd ne'er endure So long an interval of pray'r. But I, Deluded king! 'Twas I shou'd have foreseen His stedfast piety. I shou'd have thought Your earnest warmth had some more selfish source, Something that touch'd you nearer, than your love, Your counterfeited zeal for me.âThou knew'st How dear I held him; how I priz'd his truth! Did I not chuse him from a subject world, Unbless'd by fortune, and by birth ungrac'd, A captive and a Jew? and yet I lov'd him! Was he not rich in independent worth? There, there he fell! If he had been less great, He had been safe. Thou cou'dst not bear his brightness; The lustre of his virtues quite obscur'd, And dimm'd thy fainter merit. Rash old man! Go, and devise some means to set me free From this dread load of guilt! Go, set at work Thy plotting genius to redeem the life Of venerable Daniel! PHARNACES. 'Tis too late. He has offended 'gainst the new decree; Has dar'd to make petition to his God, Altho' the dreadful sentence of the act Full well he knew. And by th' establish'd law Of Media, by that law irrevocable, Which he has dar'd to violate, he dies! DARIUS. Impiety! presumption! monstrous pride!â Irrevocable! Is there ought on earth Deserves that name? Th' eternal laws alone Of Oromasdes claim it. But, alas! All human projects are so faintly fram'd, So feebly plann'd, so liable to change, So mix'd with error in their very form, That mutable and mortal are the same. But where is Daniel? Wherefore comes he not To load me with reproaches? to upbraid me With all the wrongs my barb'rous haste has done him? Where is he? PHARNACES. He prepares to meet his fate. This hour he dies, for so the act decrees. DARIUS. Suspend the bloody sentence! Bring him hither! Or rather let me seek him, and implore His dying pardon, and his parting pray'r.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART VI. SCENE, Daniel's House. DANIEL, ARASPES. ARASPES. Still let me follow thee; still let me hear The voice of Wisdom, ere the silver cord By Death's cold hand be loosen'd. DANIEL. Now I'm ready! No grief; no woman's weakness, good Araspes! Thou shou'dst rejoice my pilgrimage is o'er, And the blest haven of repose in view. ARASPES. And must I lose thee, Daniel? must thou die? DANIEL. And what is death, my friend, that I shou'd fear it? To die! why 'tis to triumph; 'tis to join The great assembly of the good and just; Immortal worthies, heroes, prophets, saints! Oh! 'tis to join the band of holy men, Made perfect by their suff'rings! 'Tis to meet My great progenitors! 'tis to behold Th' illustrious Patriarchs, they with whom the Lord Deign'd hold familiar converse! 'Tis to see Bless'd Noah and his children, once a world! 'Tis to behold (oh! rapture to conceive!) Those we have known, and lov'd, and lost, below! Bold Azariah, and the band of brothers, Who sought, in bloom of youth, the scorching flames! Nor is it to behold heroic men Alone, who fought the fight of faith on earth; But heav'nly conquerors, angelic hosts, Michael and his bright legions, who subdued The foes of Truth! To join their blest employ Of love and praise! To the high melodies Of choirs celestial to attune my voice, Accordant to the golden harps of saints! To join in bless'd hosannahs to their King! Whose face to see, whose glory to behold, Alone were heav'n, tho' saint or seraph none There were beside, and only he were there! This is to die! Who wou'd not die for this? Who wou'd not die that he might live for ever? DARIUS, DANIEL, ARASPES. DARIUS. Where is he? where is Daniel? Let me see him! Let me embrace that venerable form Which I have doom'd to glut the greedy maw Of furious lions! DANIEL. King Darius, hail! DARIUS. O, injur'd Daniel! can I see thee thus? Thus uncomplaining? can I bear to hear That when the ruffian ministers of death Stopp'd thy unfinish'd pray'r, thy pious lips Had just invok'd a blessing on Darius, On him who sought thy life? Thy murd'rers dropt Tears of strange pity. Look not on me thus, With mild benignity! Oh! I cou'd bear The voice of keen reproach, or the strong flash Of fierce resentment; but I cannot stand That touching silence, nor that patient eye Of meek respect! DANIEL. Thou art my master still. DARIUS. I am thy murd'rer! I have sign'd thy death! DANIEL. I know thy bent of soul is honourable: Thou hast been gracious still! Had it been otherwise, I wou'd have met th' appointment of high Heav'n, With humble acquiescence; but to know Thy will concurr'd not with thy servant's fate, Adds joy to resignation. DARIUS. Here I swear, By him who sits inthron'd in yon bright sun, Thy blood shall be aton'd! On these, thy foes, Thou shalt have ample vengeance. DANIEL. Hold, O king! Vengeance is mine, th' eternal Lord has said; And I will recompence, with even hand, The sinner for the sin. The wrath of man Works not the righteousness of God. DARIUS. I had hop'd We shou'd have trod this busy stage together, A little longer; then have sunk to rest, In honourable age! Who now shall guide My shatter'd bark in safety? Who shall now Direct me? O, unhappy state of kings! 'Tis well the robe of majesty is gay, Or who wou'd put it on? A crown! what is it? It is to bear the mis'ries of a people! To hear their murmurs, feel their discontents, And sink beneath a load of splendid care! To have your best success ascrib'd to Fortune, And Fortune's failures all ascrib'd to you! It is to sit upon a joyless height, To every blast of changing fate expos'd! Too high for hope! too great for happiness! For friendship too much fear'd! To all the joys Of social freedom, and th' endearing charm Of lib'ral interchange of soul unknown! Fate meant me an exception to the rest, And, tho' a monarch, bless'd me with a friend; And Iâhave murder'd him! DANIEL. My hour approaches! Hate not my mem'ry, king! protect Araspes. Encourage Cyrus in the holy work Of building ruin'd Solyma. Farewell! DARIUS. With most religious strictness I'll fulfil Thy last request. Araspes shall be next My throne and heart. Farewell! [They embrace. Hear, future kings! Ye unborn rulers of the nations, hear! Learn from my crime, from my misfortune learn, Never to trust to weak, or wicked hands, That delegated pow'r which Oromasdes Invests in monarchs for the public good.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART VII. SCENE, The Court of the Palace. [The sun rising. DARIUS, ARASPES. DARIUS. Oh, good Araspes! what a night of horror! To me the dawning day brings no return Of cheerfulness or peace! No balmy sleep Has seal'd these eyes, no nourishment has past These loathing lips, since Daniel's fate was sign'd! Hear what my fruitless penitence resolvesâ The thirty days my rashness had decreed The edict's force shou'd last, I will devote To mourning and repentance, fasting, pray'r, And all due rites of grief. For thirty days, No pleasant sound of dulcimer or harp, Sackbut, or flute, or psaltery shall charm My ear, now dead to ev'ry note of joy! ARASPES. My grief can know no period! DARIUS. See that den! There Daniel met the furious lion's rage! There were the patient martyr's mangled limbs Torn piece-meal! Never hide thy tears, Araspes; 'Tis virtuous sorrow, unallay'd like mine By guilt and fell remorse! Let us approach. Who knows but that dread Pow'r to whom he pray'd So often and so fervently, has heard him! [He goes to the mouth of the den. O, Daniel, servant of the living God! He whom thou hast serv'd so long, and lov'd so well, From the devouring lion's famish'd jaw, Can he deliver thee? DANIEL. [From the bottom of the den. He can, he has! DARIUS. Methought I heard him speak! ARASPES. O, wondrous force Of strong imagination! were thy voice Loud as the trumpet's blast, it cou'd not wake him From that eternal sleep! DANIEL. [In the den. Hail! king Darius! The God I serve has shut the lion's mouth To vindicate my innocence. DARIUS. He speaks! He lives! ARASPES. 'Tis no illusion: 'tis the sound Of his known voice. DARIUS. Where are my servants? haste, Fly swift as light'ning, free him from the den, Release him, bring him hither! Break the seal Which keeps him from me! See, Araspes! look! See the charm'd lions!âMark their mild demeanor; Araspes, mark!âthey have no pow'r to hurt him! See how they hang their heads, and smooth their fierceness, At his mild aspect! ARASPES. Who that sees this sight, Who that in after-times shall hear this told, Can doubt if Daniel's God be God indeed? DARIUS. None, none, Araspes! ARASPES. Ah! he comes; he comes! Enter DANIEL, follow'd by multitudes. DANIEL. Hail, great Darius! DARIUS. Dost thou live indeed? And live unhurt? ARASPES. O, miracle of joy! DARIUS. I scarce can trust my eyes! How didst thou 'scape? DANIEL. That bright and glorious Being who vouchsaf'd Presence divine, when the three martyr'd brothers Essay'd the caldron's flame, supported me! Ev'n in the furious lions' dreadful den, The prisoner of hope, even there I turn'd To the strong hold, the bulwark of my strength, Ready to hear, and mighty to redeem! DARIUS. [To Araspes. Where is Pharnaces? Take the hoary traitor; Take too Soranus, and the chief abettors Of this dire edict. Let not one escape. The punishment their deep-laid hate devis'd For holy Daniel, on their heads shall fall With tenfold vengeance. To the lions' den I doom his vile accusers! All their wives, Their children too, shall share one common fate! Take care that none escape.âGo, good Araspes. DANIEL. [Araspes goes out. Not so, Darius. O spare the guiltless; spare the guilty too! Where sin is not, to punish were unjust; And where sin is, O king! there fell remorse Supplies the place of punishment! DARIUS. No more! My word is past! Not one request, save this, Shalt thou e'er make in vain. Approach, my friends. Araspes has already spread the tale, And see, what crowds advance. PEOPLE. Long live Darius! Long live great Daniel too, the people's friend! DARIUS. Draw near, my subjects. See this holy man! Death had no pow'r to harm him. Yon' fell band Of famish'd lions, soften'd at his sight, Forgot their nature, and grew tame before him. The mighty God protects his servants thus! The righteous thus he rescues from the snare Of death, while fraud's artificer shall fall In the deep gulf his wily arts devise To snare the innocent! A COURTIER. To the same den Araspes bears Pharnaces and his friends; Fall'n is their insolence! With pray'rs and tears, And all the meanness of high-crested pride, When adverse fortune frowns, they beg for life. Araspes will not hear. âYou heard not me, He cries, when I for Daniel's life implor'd; His God protected him! see now if yours Will listen to your cries?â DARIUS. Now hear, People and nations! languages and realms, O'er whom I rule! Peace be within your walls! That I may banish from the minds of men The rash decree gone out; hear me resolve To counteract its force by one more just. In ev'ry kingdom of my wide-stretch'd realm, From fair Chaldea to the extremest bound Of northern Media, be my edict sent, And this my statute known. My heralds haste, And spread my royal mandate thro' the land, That all my subjects bow the ready knee To Daniel's Godâfor he alone is Lord. Let all adore, and tremble at his name, Who sits in glory unapproachable Above the heav'nsâabove the heav'n of heavens! His pow'r is everlasting; and his throne, Founded in equity and truth, shall last Beyond the bounded reign of time and space, Thro' wide eternity! With his right-arm He saves, and who opposes? He defends, And who shall injure? In the perilous den He rescued Daniel from the lion's mouth! His common deeds are wonders, and his works One ever-during chain of miracles! Enter ARASPES. ARASPES. All hail, O king! Darius live for ever! May all thy foes be as Pharnaces is! DARIUS. Araspes, speak! ARASPES. O, let me spare the tale!â 'Tis full of horror! Dreadful was the sight! The hungry lions, greedy for their prey, Devour'd the wretched princes, ere they reach'd The bottom of the den. DARIUS. Now, now confess, 'Twas some superior hand restrain'd their rage, And tam'd their furious appetites. PEOPLE. 'Tis true! The God of Daniel is a mighty God, He saves and he destroys. ARASPES. O, friend! O, Daniel! No wav'ring doubts can ever more disturb My settled faith. DANIEL. To God be all the glory!</field>
