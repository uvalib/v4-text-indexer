      <field name="fulltext">TO THE VERTUOUSLY NOBLE AND TRULY HONORABLE LADY, The Lady CATHERINE MOHUN, Wife to the Lord Warwick Mohun, Baron of Okehampton, my highly honored LORD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Mr. Alexander Goughe upon his publishing. The excellent Play call'd the Queen; or the Excellencie of her Sex. If Playes be looking glasses of our lives Where dead examples quickning art revives: By which the players dresse themselves, and we By them may forme a living Imagry To let those sullied, lie in age in dust Or break them with pretense, of fit and just. Is a rude cruelty, as if you can Put on the christian, and put off the man. But must all morall handsomnes undoe And may not be divine and civill too. What though we dare not say the Poets art Can save while it delights, please and convert; Or that blackfriers we heare which in this age Fell when it was a church, not when a stage, Or that the In the originall it is Puritans. Presbiters that once dwelt there, Prayed and thriv'd though the playhouse were so near. Yet this we dare affirme there is more gain In seeing men act vice then vertue fain; And he less tempts a danger that delights In profest players then close Hypocrites, Can there no favour to the scæne be shown Because Jack Fletcher was a Bishops son, Or since that order is condemn'd doe you Think poets therefore Antichristian too; Is it unlawfull since the stage is down To make the press act: where no ladies swoune At the red coates intrusion: none are strip't; No Hystriomastix has the copy whip't No man d' on Womens cloth's: the guiltles presse Weares its own innocent garments: its own dresse, Such as free nature made it: Let it come Forth Midwife Goughe, securely; and if some Like not the make or beautie of the play Bear witnes to 't and confidently say Such a relict as once the stage did own, Ingenuous Reader, merits to be known. R. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">For Plays. Do you not Hawke? Why mayn't we have a Play? Both are but recreations. You'll say Diseases which have made Physitians dumb, By healthful excercise are overcome. And Crimes escap'd all other laws, have been Found out, and punish'd by the curious Scene. Are Stages hurtful for the ill they teach, And needless for the good? Which Pulpits preach: Then sports are hurtful, for the time they lose, And needless to the good, which labour does. Permit 'm both; or if you will allow The minde no Hawke, leave yours, and go to Plough. EDMOND ROOKWOOD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Mr. Goughe, upon the publication of the Play, call'd, the Queen, or the Excellency of her Sex. Goughe, In this little Present you create Your self a Trophee, may become a State; For you that preserve wit, may equally Be ranck'd with those defend our Liberty; And though in this ill treated Scene of sense, The general learning is but in pretence; Or else infus'd like th' Eastern Prophet's Dove, To whisper us, Religion, Honour, Love; Yet the more Generous race of men revives This Lamp of Knowledge, and like Primitives In Caves, fearless of Martyrdom, rehearse The almost breathless, now, Dramatick verse. How in the next age will our Youth lament The loss of wit, condem'd to banishment. Wit that the duller rout despise, 'cause they Miss it in what their Zealous Priests display For Priests in melancholy Zeal admit Onely a grave formality for wit; And would have those that govern us comply And cherish their fallacious tyranny. But wherein States can no advantage gain, They harmless mirth improperly restrain; Since men cannot be naturally call'd free, If Rulers claim more then securitie. How happens then this rigour o're the Stage In this restor'd, free, and licentious age? For Plays are Images of life, and cheat Men into vertue, and injest repeat What they most seriously think; nor may We fear lest Manners suffer: every day Does higher, cunninger, more sin invent Then any Stage did ever represent. It may indeed shew evil, and affright, As we prize day by th' ugliness of night. But in the Theatre men are easier caught, Then by what is in clamorous pulpits taught. T. C.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS PRIMUS. Enter Petruchi with Bufo, Pynto and Muretto, in poor habits. Petr. All free, and all forgiven. Omnes. Bless her Majesty. Petr. Henceforth (my friends) take heed how you so hazard Your lives and fortunes on the peevish motion Of every discontent, you will not finde Mercy so rife at all times. Muret. Gratious Sir! Your counsel is more like an Oracle, Then mans advice, for my part I dare speak For one, I rather will be rackt asunder Then e're again offend so wise a Majesty. Petr. 'Tis well, your lives are once more made your own; I must attend the execution Of your hot General, each shift now for your selves. Exit Petruchi. Buf. Is he gone, ha, ha, ha! We have the common Capony of the cleer heavens Once more o're our heads, Sirs. Muret. We are at liberty out of the Hangmans clutches, Now, mark, what good language and fair words Will do, Gentlemen. Pyn. Good language! O, let me go back and be hang'd, rather then live within the rotten infection of thy Cankred breath; the poyson of a flatterers tongue is a thousand times more deadly, then the twinges of a rope; Thou birth of an unlucky Planet: I abhor thee. Muret. Fy, fy! Can you rail on your friends thus. Pyn. Friends, my friend! Captain, come from that slippery Ele, Captain. His very cradle was in dirt and mud His milk the oyl of serpents; his mother a mangy Mermaid, and a male Crocodile begat him. Muret. This needs not sweet, Signior Pynto. Pyn. Sweet Signior? Sweet Cog a foyst, go hang thy self, thou'dst jeer the very rags I wear off my back with thy fustians of sweet, precious, unmatchable, rare, wise, juditious, hey do! Pox on thee; Sirrah, Sirrah, Hast not thou many a time and often devoured a whole table of mine, garnisht with plenty, nay; variety of good wholesome fare, under the colour of telling news with a roughy complement? Muret. Good fare of thine! Buf. Nay, dear Gentlemen. Pyn. Mine! I mine, Sycophant, I (dost mark me) to supply thy totters, paun'd a whole study of Ephimerides, so rich, that they might have set up a Corporation of Almanack makers; and what had I in return? But protestations, (hearest thou this maunderer) that I was, for learning, the soundest; for bounty, the royallest; for discourse, the sententioust; for behavour, the absolutest; for all endowments of minde and body, the most accomplisht that nature ever call'd her workmanship: but thou dog, thou scoundrel, my beggery was the fruits of thy flattery. Stand off, Rascal, off. Buf. This is excellent 'faith; Muret. How, how! I flatter ye? What thee, thee? A poor lousy uncloakt imposter, a deceitful, couzening, cheating, dull decoying fortune teller; Thou pawn books; thou, patcht out of an old shepheards Calender, that discoursest in time of the change of the weather. And whose were thy Ephemerides? Why, Impudence, wert thou ever worth Erra Pater's Prognostication? Thou learned! In what? By filching, stealing, borrowing, eating, collecting, and counting with as weather-wise Ideots as thy self; once in twelve moneths thou wert indeed delivered, (like a big bellied wife) of a two penny Almanack, at Easter. A Hospital boy in a blew coat shall transcribe as much in six hours to serve all the year. Thou a table of meat, yes, Astronomers fare, air; or at a feast upon high holy dayes, three red Sprats in a dish; that was held gultony soo. I flatter thee? Thou learned? Pyn. Rascal, Cannibal that feedest upon mans flesh. Buf. Nay, pray, pray heartily Gentlemen; in good earnest, and as I live, and by this hand now— Muret. Right thou put'st me in minde what I should call thee; Who was't the cause of all the late insurrection for which we were all like to be hang'd, and our brave General Alphonso is this day to suffer for; who but thou, forsooth; the influences of the Stars, the conjunction of the Planets, the prediction of the celestial bodies were peremptory, that if a' would but attempt a civil commotion, a' should (I marry should a') be strait crown'd present King of Arragon. Now your Gipsonly may i'th moon, your divination hath fairly mounted him; poor Gentleman, he's sure to leave his head in pawn for giving credit to thy prognosticating ignorance. Pyn. I scorn thee, Parasite. Muret. You are a stinking starv'd-gut star-gazer. Is that flattery or no. Buf. 'S foot, What do you mean, Signior Pynto, Signior Muretto? Pyn. I will be reveng'd, and watch my time, Sirrah. Muret. Do. Buf. This is strange my Masters, to be so neer the place of execution and prattle so loud; Come, Signior Pynto, indeed la you shall shake hands. Pyn. Let me alone, y'are a foolish Captain. Muretto, I will display thee for a— Muret. Hang thy self, I care not for thee this. Buf. Foolish Captain, foolish Captain, heark ye, Pynto, there's no such good meaning in that word. Pyn. A Parrat can eccho, talk to Schollers so. Muret. A proper Scholler, stitcht up of waste paper. Buf. Sneaks, if I be a fool, I'll bang out the wits of some of your nodles, or dry bastinado your sides. Ye Dogrel, maungy scabbed owlaglasses, I'll mawle yee, so I will. Muret. Captain, sweet Captain, nay, look, now will you put your discretion to coxcombs? Buf. Yes, the proudest coxcombs of 'em all, if I be provok'd; foolish, flesh and blood cannot eudur't. Muret. So, goodman sky walker, you have made a trim hand on't, to chafe your self into a throat cutting. Buf. I will shred you both so small, that a very botcher shall shred Spanish needles, with every fillet of your itchy flesh; call me foolish, ye whelps-moyles; my father was a Corn-cutter, and my mother a muscle woman, 'tis known what I am, and I'll make you know what I am, If my choler be raised but one inch higher. Pyn. Well, I see Mars and Saturn, were thy Planets. Thou art a valiant souldier, and there's no dealing with ye. For the Captains sake, I will abate my indignation, Muretto. But— Buf. But i'thy face, I'll have no buts, S' bores, the black guard is more honorably suted then any of us three. Foolish, foolish, will never out of my head whilst I live. Enter Velasco and Lodovico. Muret. Long life, eternal prosperity, the blessing o'th heavens, and honors of the Earth, crown the glorious merits of the incomparable, Captain Don Velasco. Pyn. The Chime goes again, Captain. Velas. Who are these poor Creatures, Lodovico. Lodov. My Lord, I know them now, they are some of the late mutineers, whom you (when you, took Alphonso prisoner) presented to the rigor of the Law, but since they are by the Queen's pardon set at liberty. Velas. I should know yonder fellow. Your name is Bufo, if I mistake not. Buf. My name is my own name, Sir, and Bufo is my name, Sir; if any man shall deny't, I dare challenge him in defence of my Godfathers that gave me that name, Sir; and what say you to that, Sir? Muret. A shallow, unbrain'd, weak, foolish fellow, and so forth: Your lordship understands me; But for our parts my good Lord— Velas. Well, Gentlemen, I cannot tell you now, That any poor endeavours of mine own Can work Alphonso's peace, yet I have spoke And kneell'd and sued for his reprieve. The Queen Hath heard, but will not grant; This is the day, And this the time, and place, where he must render The forfeit of his life unto the Law. I onely can be sorry. Enter Petruchi, after the hangman bearing the axe before Alphonso, with Officers. Petr. Alphonso, here's the place, and this the hour; Your doom is past, and now the sword of Law Must cut the vein that swell'd with such a frensy Of dangerous blood against your Queen and Country. Prepare yourself, 'tis now too late to hope. Alph. Petruchi, what is done I did, my ground Was pitty of my country, not malice to't. I sought to free wrack'd Arragon from ruin, Which a fond womans government must bring. O had you and the nobles of this land, A touch but of the miseries, her weakness Must force ye of neceessity to feel, You would with me have bent your naked swords Against this female Mistriss of the Crown, And not have been such children to have fawn'd Upon a girles nodd. Petr. You are distracted; She is our lawful Soveraign, we her Subjects. Alph: Subjects, Petruchi, abjects, and so live; I come to die, on to the execution. Pyn. Here's a high Saturnal spirit, Captain. Buf. Pox o' spirits when they mount a man to the Hangmans mercy, I do not like such spirits, Let me rather be a moon calf. Velas. I come to bid farewel, and in farewel, To excuse my much ill fortune, for beleeve, Sir, I hold my victory an overthrow. To tell you how incessantly I ply'd Her Grace, for your remission, were as useless As was my suit, I sorry for your youth. Let's part yet reconcil'd. Alph. With all my heart; It is my glory, that I was reduc'd By the best man at arms, that ever knighthood Hath stil'd a Souldier—Alas! What souls are those? Now, now, in seeing them I die too late. Buf. O brave General, O noble General, we are still the rags of the old Regiment. The truth on't is, we were loth to leave thee, till thy head and shoulders parted companies. But sweet good dear General take courage, what, we are all mortal men, and must every one pass this way, as simple as we stand here. Alph. Give me thy hand, farewel; the Queen is merciful in sparing you; I have not ought to give thee but my last thanks. Buf. Blirt o' giving, our clothes are paid for, and A day will come shall quit us all. Alph. Art thou, and thou there too; well, leave thy art, And do not trust the fixions of the stars, They spoke no truth by me: My Lord Velasco, That creature, there, Muretto, is a man Of honest heart, for my sake take him to you: And now soft, peace to all. Pyn. I will burn my books, for sware the liberal sciences, and that is my resolution. Buf. Go thy way for the arrantest General, that ever led crew of brave Sketdreus. Petr. Will you make ready, Sir. Alph. Petruchi, yes, I have a debt to pay, 'tis natures due. Fellow before thou ask my pardon, take it; Be sure and speedy in thy fatal blow. Hangm. Never fear clean shaving, Sir. Alph. May I have leave to meditate? Petr. You may. Lodov. A gallant resolution, even in death. Enter Queen, Collummello, Almada, Herophil, and attendants. Col. Stay execution 'tis her Highnes pleasure; Aphonso rise ye, and behold the Queen. Alph. Beshrew the voice of Majesty, my thoughts Were fixt upon an upper Region now, And traffick not with Earth; alas great woman, What newer tyranny, what doom, what torments Are borrowed from the conclave of that hell, Where legions of worse Devils, then are in hell Keep revels, a proud womans heart. What plagues Are broacht from thence to kill me? Pyn. (Aside ... ) The moon is now Lady of the ascendant, and the man will dye raving.( ... Aside.) Alm. Ey, Alphonso, Will you commit another strange commotion With your unruly tongue. And what you cannot Perform in act, attempt to do in words? A dying man be so uncharitable. Alph. Cry mercy, she is Queen of Arragon, And would with her own eyes (insteed of maskes And courtly sports) behold an act of death. Queen, welcom, Queen, here quaff my blood like wine; And live a brave she tyrant. Qu. Alas, poor man. Alph. Poor man, that looks on me, delighted to destroy me. Buf. Good boy i'faith, by this hand a' speaks just as I would do, for all that he is so near being made puddings meat. Qu. You are sorry For your late desperate rudeness, Are you not? Alph. By all my miseries these taunts are cruelty. Worse then the Hangmans ax, I am not sorry, Nay more, will not be sorry, know from me I hate your sex in general, not you As y'are a Queen, but as y'are a woman: Had I a term of life could last for ever, And you could grant it, yes, and would, yet all Or more should never reconcile my heart To any she alive—are ye resolved? Qu. His spirit flies out in his daring language. Alphonso though the law require thy head, Yet I have mercy where I see just cause: You'l be a new man? Alph. Oh! A womans tongue Is sharper then a pointed steel; Tender, Madam, I kiss your Royal hand, and call you fair, Assure this noble, this uncovered presence, That richest vertue is your bosoms tenant, That you are absolutely great and good; I'll flatter all the vices of your sex, Protesting men are monsters, women Angels, No light ones, but full weighty, natures best, I'll proclaim lust a pitty, pride a handsomness. Deceit ripness of wit, bold scandalous scolding, A bravery of spirit; bloody cruelty, Masculine justice; more I will maintain That Queens are chief for rule, you chief of Queens, If you'l but give me leave to die in peace. Pray give me leave to die. Pray good now do, What think ye, 'tis a Royal grant; henceforth Heaven be the rest you chose, but never come at. A kinde farewel to all. Col. Can you endure To let a Rebel prate? off with his head, And let him then dispute. Petr. I should have us'd The priviledge of time, had I known this. You must not talk so loud. Qu. My Lords, a word: What if we pardoned him, I think the neerness of his arrival to the stroke of death, Will ever be a warning to his Loyalty. Alm. How pardon him! What means your Majesty? What can you hope from one so wholly drown'd In melancholy and sowre discontent; That should he share the Crown, a' would imploy t On none but Apes and Flatterers. Velas. Spare, my Lord Such liberal censure, rather reyn the fury Of Justice, then so spur it on. Great Mistris, I will not plead my services, but urge The glories you may challenge by your mercy. It will be a most sweet becoming act To set you in the Chronicles of memory. Qu. Velasco, thou art not more brave in arms To conquer with thy valour, then thy courtesie. Alphonso, take thy life, who took thee prisoner, Is now become thy spokesman. Alph. Phew, mock not Calamity so grosly. Velas. You are too desperate: The Queen hath freely pardoned you. Qu. And more to purchase kinde opinion of thy Sex, our self will lend our help. Lords, all your hands. Lodov. But is the Queen in earnest? Velas. It becomes her, Mercy is God like. Qu. Officers be gone. Exit Officers Such objects for a Royal presence are Unfit, here kiss our hand, we dare conceive That 'twas thy hight of youth, not hate of us Drew thee to those attempts, and both we pardon. Muret. Do not the stars run a wrong byas now, Signior Pynto? Pyn. Venus is Lady of the Ascendant, man. I knew if once he pass the fatal hour, the influence would work another way. Muret. Very likely, your reasons are infallible. Qu. What can our favours challenge. Alph. More true service, True faith, true Love, then I have words to utter. Qu. Which we accept, lead on, here ends this strife, When Law craves justice, mercy should grant life. Exit all but Pynto and his fellows. Pyn. Go thy waies for a sure sound brain'd piece whilst thou livest; Pynto, say I, now, now, now, am I an ass, now my Masters, hang your selves, 'S foot, I'll stand to't; that man whoever he be, (better or worse, all's one) who is not star wise, is natures fool; your Astonomer hath the heavens, the whole globe of the earth, and the vast gulf of the Sea it self, for his proper kingdom, his fee-simple, his own inheritance, who looks any higher then the top of a steeple, or a may-pool, is worthy to die in a ditch. But to know the conjunctions of the Planets, the influences of the celestial body, the harmony of the spheares, frost and snow, hail and tempests, rain and sun-shine, nay, life and death; here's cunning, to be deep in speculation, to be groping the secrets of nature. Muret. O, Sir, there, there, there. Pyn. Let me alone, I say it my self, I know I am a rare fellow; why, look, look ye, we are all made, or let me be stew'd in Star-shut; pish, I am confident, and we shall all mount, beleeve it. Buf. Shall we, nay, then I am resolv'd. Muret. Frier Bacon was but a brazen head, in comparison of him. Buf. But why should you not have said so much before, goodman Jolthead? Muret. Nay, look ye, Captain, there's a time for all things. Buf. For all this, what will become of us; is the sign lucky to venture the begging of a cast sute? Let me be resolved of that once. Muret. 'Twas wisely urg'd, Captain. Pyn. Mans richest ornament is his nakedness, Gentlemen, variety of clothing is the surquedry of fools; wise men have their proper solace in the linings of their mindes; as for fashions, 'tis a disease for a horse. Muret. Never richer stuff came from man. Buf. 'Zookes, 'tis a scurvy, a pocky, and a naked answer; a plague of all your sentences; whilst I am like to starve with hunger and cold, Enter Messenger. Mes. By your leave, Gentlemen, the Lord Alphonso hath sent you this purse of gold, commands ye to put your selves into costly sutes, and repair to Court; All. How! To Court! Mes. Where you may happily see him Crowned King, for that's the common report; I was charg'd to urge you to be very speedy: farewel, Gentlemen. Exit. Pyn. What think ye now, my hearts of gold? Muret. Hearts of gold indeed now, Signior. Pyn. Pish, I am a coxcomb, I; Oh, the divinity of— Buf. Bawll no more the weather's cold, I must have utensicles, follow your leader, ho. Exit all. Enter Velasco and Lodovico. Velas. Prethee perswade me not. Lodov. You'l loose your honor. Velas. Ide rather loose my honor then my faith: O, Lodovico, thou art witness with me, that I have sworn, and pledg'd my heart, my truth to her deserving memory, whose beauty, is through the world unfellowed. Lodov. Here the wisdom of sword men, They deal all by strength not policy. What exercise shall be fain'd, let me know that? Velas. Excuse, why, Lodovico, I am sick, And I am sick indeed, sick to the soul. Lodov. For a decay'd tilter, or a known Coward, this were tollerable now: But to the business; I have solicited your widow. Velas. Will she nor speak with me? Lodov. Young widows, and grave old Ones two, by your leave care not so much for talking; if you come once to them you must do, and do, and do again, Again, and again, all's two little, you'l finde it. Velas. Come, friend, you mock my miseries. Lodov. It's a fine laughing matter when the best and most approved souldier of the world, should be so heart-sick for love of a placket: Well I have sent your wise servant (for fools are best to be trusted in womens things) to my couzen Shaparoon, and by him your second letter, you shall shortly hear what news: My couzen is excellently traded in these mortal businesses of flesh and blood, and will hardly come of with two denials. Velas. If she prevail, Lodovico— Lodov. What then? Ply your occupation when you come to't, 'tis a fit season of the year, women are hony-moon if a man could jump with them at the instant, and prick 'em in the right vain; else this Queen would never have sav'd a Traytor from the block, and suddenly made him her King and Husband. But no more of that, there's danger in't; Y'are sick you say? Velas. Pierc't through with fiery darts, much worse then death. Lodov. Why your onely present remedy is, then as soon as you can, to quench those fires in the watry Channels of qualification: soft, no more words, behold a prodegy. Florish. Enter Colonnello, Almada bare, Alphonso and the Queen Crowned, Herophil, Petruchi with a Guard, the King and Queen take their States. All. Long live Alphonso King of Arragon. Alph. Then we are Soveraign. Qu. As free, as I by birth: I yeeld to you (my Lord) my Crown, my Heart, My People, my Obedience; In exchange What I demand is Love. Alph. You cannot miss it, There is but one thing that all humane power Or malice of the Devil could set a broach, To work on for a breach 'twixt you and me. Qu. One thing! Why, is there one thing then, my Lord? Alph. Yes, and 'tis onely this; y'are still a woman. Qu. A woman! Said you so, sir. Alph. I confess You have deserv'd more service, more regard From me, in my particular, then life Can thank you for; and that you may conceive My fair acknowledgment; although 'tis true, I might command; yet I will make a suit, An earnest suit t'ee. Qu. It must then be granted. Alph. That to redeem a while some serious thoughts Which have misdeem'd your sex. You'l be content I be a married Batchelor one sennight. You cannot but conceive. Col. How's this? Petr. Fine work. Qu. Alas my Lord, this needs no publick mention. Alph. Nay, Madam, hear me, That our our Courts be kept Under a several roof; that you and I May not for such a short time, come together. Qu. I understand you not. Alph. Your patience, Madam, You interrupt me, That no message pass Of commendation, questioning our healths, Our sleeps, our actions, or what else belongs To common curtesie, 'twixt friend, and friend. You must be pleas'd to grant it, I'll have it so. Qu. No message of commends! Alph. Phew, you demur, It argues your distrust. Qu. I am content The King should be obeyed. Pray heaven all be well. Alph. Velasco, thou wer't he didst conquer me, Didst take me prisoner? wer't in that the means To raise me up thus high. I thank thee for't; I thought to honour thee in a defence Of the Queens beauty; but wee'l now deferr't. Yet hand your mistris, lead her to the Court, We and our Lords will follow, there wee'l part; A seven dayes absence cannot seem but short. Ex. all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act II. Enter Shaparoon and Mopas. Shap. And as I said (nay pray my friend be covered) the business hath been soundly followed on my part. Yet again, in good sooth, I cannot abide you should stand bare before me to so little purpose. Mop. Manners is a Jewel (Madam) and as for standing bare, I know there is som difference, the putting down of a mans cap, and the putting down of his breeches before a reverend gentlewoman. Shap. You speak very properly, there is a great deal of difference indeed. But to come to the point; Fy, what a stir I had to make her to receive the letter, and when she had received it, to open it, and then to read it; nay, to read it again and again; that as I am a very woman, a man might have wrong my smock dropping wet, with the purse sweat that came from my body. Friend, I took such pains with her. Oh my conscience, to bear a child at those years would not trouble me half so much as the delivery of that letter did. Mop. A man-child of my age perhaps, Madam, would not. Shap. Yet that were a sore burthen for one that is not us'd to't, I may tell you. O these coy girles are such wild cattel to have dealing with. Mop. What ancient Madams cannot do one way, let them do another; she's a rank Jade that being past the breeder, cannot kick up her heels, wince, and cry wee-hee: good examples cannot chuse from ones elders, but work much to the purpose, being well ply'd, and in season. Shap. In season? True, that's a chief thing; yes, I'll assure you my friend, I am but entring into eight and twenty. Mop. Wants somwhat of that too, I take it; I warrant ye your mark appears yet to be seen for proof of your age, as plain as when you were but fifteen. Shap. Truly, if it were well searcht, I think it does. Your name is Mopas, you told me? Mop. Mopas my name is, and yours Madam Shaparoon I was told. Shap. A right Madam born I can assure ye. Mop. Your Ancestors will speak that, for the Shaparoons have ever took place of the best French-hoods in the parish; ever since the first addition. Shap. All this with a great deal of modesty I must confess. Ud's Pittikins, stand by, aside a little: see where the lady coms; do not appear before you are call'd, in any case: but mark how I will work her like wax. Enter Salassa reading a letter. Salas. Your servant in all commands Velasco. So, and I am resolved to put ye to the test, servant, for your free fools heart, e're I give you the slip, I warrant ye. Shap. Your ladyship hath considered the premises e're this time, at full, I hope. Salas. O, Shaparoon, you keep true sentinel, what? I must give certain answer; must I not? Shap. Nay, Madam, you may chuse, 'tis all in your Ladiships discreet consideration. The sum of all is, that if you shew him not some favour, he is no long lives man. Salas. Very well; how long have you been a factress for such Merchants, Shaparoon. Shap. O my Religion! I a factress? I am even well enough serv'd for my good will; and this is my requital. Factress, quoth you? Salas. Come, your intercession shall prevail, which is his letter carrier? Mop. At your ladiships service. Salas. Your Lord Velasco sent you? Mop. Most true, sweet madam. Salas. What place hold you about him? Mop. I am his Drugster, Madam. Salas. What Sir? Mop. Being hard bound with melancholy, I give him a purge, with two or three soluble stools of laughter. Salas. Belike you are his fool, or his jester. Mop. Jester if you please, but not fool, Madam; for bables belong to fools, and they are then onely fit for ladies secresies, not for Lords. Salas. But is he indeed sick of late? Shap. Alas good heart, I suffer for him. Enter Lodovico. Lodov. By your leave lady, without ceremony, you know me, and may guess my errand. Salas. Yet more trouble, nay, then I shall be hail-shor. Lodov. To be brief. By the honors of a good name, you are a dry-skinn'd widow, and did not my hast concern the life of the noblest Gentleman in Europe, I would as much scorn imployments of this nature to you, as I do a proud woman of your condition. Mop. I marry here's one will thunder her widow-head into flitters: stand to't, Signior, I am your second. Salas. Sir y'are uncivil to exclaim against a lady in her own house. Lodov. A lady, yet a paraquitto, popingjay, your whole worth lies in your gay out side, and your squawling tongue. A Wagtail is a glorious fowl in respect of many of ye. Though most of ye are in nature as very fowl as wagtayles. Salas. Are such as you the Lord Velasco's agents in his hot affection? Shap. Sweet cousen, Lodovico, pray now, the lady is most vertuously resolved. Mop. Heark ye middle-ag'd countess, do not take anothers tale into your mouth, I have occasion to use you in private, and can finde you work enough my self, a word in your ear. Salas. I protest, I meant more noble answer for his satisfaction, then ever your railing language shall force from me. Lodov. Were I the man that doated on you, I would take a shorter course with you, then to come humbly whining to your sweet—pox of all such ridiculous foppery—I would— Salas. Weep your self to death, and be chronicled among the regiment of kinde tender hearted souls. Lodov. Indeed, forsooth, I would not; what, for a widdow one that hath jumpt the old moyles trot, so oft, that the sciatica founders her yet in both her thighs. Salas. You abuse me grosly. Lodov. One that hath been so often drunk with satiety of pleasure, that fourteen husbands are but as half a draught to quench her thurst in an afternoon. Salas. I will no longer endure ye. Lodov. For you, you? That are neither noble, wise, rich, fair, nor wel-favoured. For you? Mop: You are all these, if you can keep your own counsel and let no body know, Mistris Madam. Shap. Nay I am so perswaded, and assure your self no body shall know. Lodov. Yet forsooth, must you be the onely precious piece the Lord Velasco must adore, must dye for. But I vow, if he do miscarry, (as I fear he cannot recover.) Salas. Goodness forbid, Alas! Is he sick, sir? Lodov. Excellent dissimulation! Yes sure, he is sick, and an everlasting silence strike you dumb that are the cause on't. But, as I said, if he do go the wrong way, as I love vertue, your ladiship shall be ballated through all Christendom, and sung to sciroy tunes, and your picture drawn over every ballad, sucking of rotten eggs among wheasels. Salas. Pray give me leave; Is Lord Velasco sick? And lies there ought in me to comfort, or recover him? Lodov. Marry does there, the more Infidel he: And what of all this now? Salas. What would you have me do? Lodov. 'Wonders, either go and visit him, or admit him to visit you; these are mighty favours are they not? Salas. Why, good Sir, I will grant the later willingly; he shall be kindly welcom. Lodov. And laught at while he is here: shall a not? Salas. What would you have me say? My best entertainment shall be open to him; I will discourse to him freely, if he requires it privately: I will be all what in honour I should. Lodov. Certifie him so much by letter. Salas. That cannot stand with my modesty, my word and truth shall be my gage. Lodov. Enough, do this, and by this hand I'll ask you pardon for my rudeness, and ever heartily honour you. Map. I shall hear from you when my leasures serves. Shap. Most assuredly. Good destines speed your journey. Mop. All happiness ride ever before you, your disgraces behinde you, and and full pleasure in the midst of ye. Exeunt. Enter Bufo in fresh apparel, ushering Herophil. Her. My over kinde, Captain, what would you say? Buf. Why, Mistris, I would say, as a man might say forsooth, indeed I would say. Her. What, Captain? Buf. Even whatsoever you would have me to say, forsooth. Her. If that be all, pray say nothing. Buf. Why look ye, Mistris, all what I say if you mark it well, is just nothing; As for example, To tell you that you are fair, is nothing, for you know it your self; to say you were honest, were an indignity to your beauty, and upon the matter nothing, for honesty in a fair woman is as good as nothing. Her. That is somwhat strange to be proved. Buf. To a good wit, dear Mistris, nothing's impossible. Her. Sure the Court and your new clothes have infected you: Would I were a purse of gold, for your sake, Captain, to reward your wit. Buf. I would you were, mistris, so you were not counterfeit metal, I should soon try you on the too true touchstone of my affections, indeed forsooth. Her. Well, witty Captain, for your love I must pass away in debt, but will not fail to think on't. But now I am in hast. Buf. If you would but grant me but one poor request, before you go, I should soon dispatch and part. Her. Name it, Captain. Buf. Truly, and as I live, 'tis a very small triffle for your part, all things considered. Her. But cannot you tell what it is? Buf. That were a fine jest indeed, why, I would desire, intreat, and beseech you. Her. What to do? Buf. There you have it, and thank you too. Her. I understand you not. Buf. Why, To do with you, forsooth, to do with you. Her. To do what? Buf. In plain words, I would commit with you, or as the more learned phrase it, if you be pleased to consent, I would ravish you. Her. Fy, fy, Captain, so uncivil, you made me blush. Buf. Do I say; why, I am glad I have it for you: Souldiers are hot upon service, mistris, and a wise mans bolt is soon shot; as the proverb says: Her. Good Captain, keep up your bolt till I am at leasure to stand fair for your mark. If the Court Stalions prove all so rank, I will vow all to ride henceforth upon an ass; so, Captain, I must leave you. Exit Herophil. Buf. Fare-wel heartily to you forsooth. Go thy waies for as true a Mistris as ever fowled clean Napary. This same whorson Court diet, cost, lodging, change of clothes, and ease, have addicted me villanously to the itch of concupiscence. Enter Alphonso; Pynto and Muretto complementing on either side of him. Alph. They all shall not intreat me. Muret. Your Majesty were no King, if your own will were not your own law. Pyn. Always, my Lord, observing the domination of the Planets: As if Mars and Venus being in conjunction, and their influence working upon your frailty; then in any case you must not resist the motion of the celestial bodies. Muret. All which (most gracious Soverain) this most famous Scoller will at a minute foretel. Buf. All hail to the King himself, my very good Liege, Lord, and most gratious benefactor. Alph. What need I other counsellors then these. Shall I be forc't to be a womans slave? That may live free, and hate their fickle sex. Muret. O 'tis a glorious vertue in so magnificent a Prince to abstain from the sensual surfets of fleshly and wanton appetites. Alph. I finde the inclination of such follies. Why, what are women? Buf. Very pleasant pretty necessary toys, an't please your Majesty; I my self could pass the time with them, as occasion migh serve, eight and forty hours out right, one to one alwaies provided. Pyn. Yet of all the seven planets, there are but two women among them, and one of them two is chast, which is as good as if shee were a boy. Muret. That is not to be questioned; the best of women are but troubles and vexations, 'tis man that retains all true perfection, and of all men your Majesty. Enter Almada and Collummello. Alph. Ye are to rude to enter on our privacies, without our license, speak, your business Lords. Alm. We came from your most vertuous Queen. Alph. No more. Col. A month is well nigh past, and yet you slack Your love to her: What mean you, sir, so strangely To slight a wife whose griefs grow now too high, For womanhood to suffer. Alm. Is't your pleasure To admit her to your bosom? Alph. Y'are too sawcy. Return, and quickly too, and tell her thus; If she intend to keep her in our favour, Let us not see her. Col. Say you so, Great Sir; You speak it but for tryal All. Ha, ha, ha. Col. O, Sir, remember what you are, and let not The insinuations of these servile creatures, Made onely men by you, sooth and traduce Your safety to a known and willful danger. Fix in your thoughts the ruine you have scap't; Who freed you; who hath rais'd you to this height, And you will then awake your judgments eye: The Commons murmur, and the streets are fill'd With busie whispers: Yet in time recal Your violence. Alph. As I am King, the tongue Forfeits his head that speaks another word. Muretto, Talk we not now like a King? Muret. Like one that hath the whole World for his proper Monarchy, and it becomes you Royally. Enter Queen, Petruchi, and Herophil. Buf. The Queen, and my Mistris; O brave, we shall have some doings hard to hand now, I hope. Alph. What means the woman? Ha! Is this the duty Of a good wife, we sent not for you, did we? Qu. The more my duty that I came unsent for; Wherein my gratious Lord have I offended? Wherein have I transgrest against thy laws O sacred Marriage? To be sequestred In the first spring and April of my joys From you, much dearer to me, then my life? By all the honour of a spotless bed, Shew me my fault and I will turn away, And be my own swift executioner. Alph. I take that word. Know then you married me Against my will, and that's your fault Qu. Alas! Against your will? I dare not contradict What you are pleased to urge. But by the love I bare the King of Arragon, (an oath As great as I can swear by) I conceiv'd Your words to be true speakers of your heart, And I am sure they were; you swore they were. How should I but beleeve, that lov'd so dearly? Alph. Come then you are a trifler, for by this I know you love me not. Qu. Is that your fear? Why la now, Lords, I told you that the King Made our division but a proof of faith. Kinde husband, now I'm bold to call you so; Was this your cunning to be jealous of me So soon? We women are fine fools To search mens pretty subtilties. Muret. You'l scarce finde it so Aside. Alph. She would perswade mee strangely. Qu. Prethee, Sweet heart, Force not thy self to look so sadly; troth It sures not with thy love, 'tis well. Was this Your sennights respite? Yet, as I am a Queen, I fear'd you had been in earnest. Alph. Earnest: Hence Monstrous enchantress, by the death I owe To Nature, thou appear'st to me in this More impudent then impudence, the tyde Of thy luxurious blood is at the full; And cause thy raging plurisie of lust Cannot be sated by our royal warmth, Thou tri'st all cunning petulent charms to raise A wanton devill up in our chast brest. But we are Canon-proof against the shot Of all thy arts. Qu. Was't you spoke that, my Lord? Pyn. Phaeton is just over the orb of the moon, his horses are got loose, and the heavens begin to grow into a combustion. Alph. I'll sooner dig a dungeon in a mole-hill, And hide my crown there, that both fools and children May trample o're my Royalty, then ever Lay it beneath an antick womans feet. Couldst thou transhape thy self into a man, And with it be more excellent then man Can be; yet since thou wer't a woman once, I would renounce thee. Petr. Let the King remember It is the Queen he speaks too. Alph. Pish, I know She would be well contented but to live Within my presence; not for love to me, But that she might with safety of her honour, Mix with some hot vein'd letcher, whose prone lust Should feed the rank impostume of desires, And get a race of bastards, to whose birth I should be thought the Dad. But thou, thou woman, E're I will be the cloak to thy false play, I'll couple with a witch, a hag; for if Thou canst live chast, live by thy sel like me. Or if thou wouldst perswade me that thou lov'st me, See me no more, never. From this time forth I hate thy sex; of all thy sex, thee worst. Exit Alphonso, Bufo, Pynto. Alm. Madam, dear Madam, yet Take comfort, time will work all for the best Qu. Where must I go? Col. Y'are in your own Kingdom, 'tis your birth-right, We all your Subjects; not a man of us, But to the utmost of his life, will right Your wrongs against this most unthankful King. Qu. Away, ye are all Traytors to profane His sacred merits with your bitter terms. Why, am I not his Wife? A wife must bear Withal what likes her Lord t'upbraid her with, And yet 'tis no injustice. What was't he said? That I no more should see him, never, never. There I am quite divorst from all my joys, From all my paradice of life. Not see him? 'Twas too unkinde a task. But he commanded I cannot but obey. Where's Herophil? Her. Here Madam. Qu. Go hang my Chamber all with mourning black; Seal up my windows, let no light survey, The subtle tapers that must eye my griefs. Get from me Lords, I will defie ye all, Y'are men, and men (O me) are all unkinde. Come hither Herophil, spread all my robes, My jewels and apparel on the floor, And for a Crown get me a Willow wreath: No, no, that's not my colour, buy me a veil Ingrayn'd in tawny. Alas, I am forsaken, And none can pitty me. Petr. By all the faith I ow to you my soveraign, if you please To enjoy me any service, I will prove Most ready and most true, Qu. Why should the King Despise me? I did never cross his will, Never gainsaid his, yea; yet sure I fear He hath some ground for his displeasure. Her. None, Unless because you sav'd him from the block. Qu. Art thou a pratler too? Peace, Herophil, Tempt not a desperate woman. No man here Dares do my last commends to him. Muret. If your excellent Majesty please to repose confidence in me; I will not onely deliver him your commendations, but think my self highly dishonored, if he return not his back to you by letter. Petr. Off beast, made all of baseness, do not grieve Calamity, or as I am a knigh, I'll cut thy tongue out. Muret. Sweet Signior, I protest— Exit Muretto. Petr. Madam, beleeve him not, he is a Parasite; Yet one the King doth dote on. Qu. Then beshrew ye, You had not us'd him gently, had I known't, I would have kneell'd before him, and have sent A handful of my tears unto the King. Away, my Lords, here is no place to revel In our discomfits. Herophil, let's hast, That thou and I may heartily like widows Bewail my bridal mockt Virginity. Col. Let's follow her my lords; I fear to late The King will yet repent these rude divisions. Exeunt. Enter Velasco, Lodovico, Mopas. Lodov. Complement? 'Tis for Barbors shops; know your own worth, you speak to a frail commodity; and barter't away roundly, my Lord. Velas. She promis'd free discourse? Lodov. She did: Are ye answer'd? Enter Salassa, Shaparoon. Shap. Madam, my Lord Velasco is come, use him nobly and kindly, or— I say no more. Salas. To a poor widow's house my Lord is welcom. Your lordship honours me in this favor; in what thankful entertainment I can, I shall strive to deserve it. Shap. Your sweet lordship is most heartily welcom, as I may say. Mop. Instead of a letter, Madam goodface, on my Lord's behalf, I am bold to salute you. Lodov. Madam Salassa, not distrusting the liberty you granted, now you and my Lord are in you own house, we will attend yee in the next room; Away, Couzen; follow, sirrah. Shap. It is a woman part to come behinde. Mop. But for two men to pass in before one woman, 'tis too much a conscience; on reverend antiquity. Exit Lodovico, Shaparoon, Mopas. Salas. What is your lorships pleasure? Velas. To rip up A story of my fate. When by the Queen I was imploy'd against the late Commotioners, (Of whom the now King was chief Leader) then In my return you pleas'd to entertain me Here in your house. Salas. Much good may it do your lordship. Velas. But then, what conquest gain'd I by that conquest, When here mine eyes, and your commanding beauty Made me a prisoner to the truest love, That ever warm'd a heart. Salas. Who might that be? Velas. You, Lady, are the deity I adore, Have kneell'd too in my heart, have vow'd my soul to, In such a debt of service, that my life Is tenant to your pleasure. Salas. Phew, my Lord; It is not nobly done to mock me thus. Velas. Mock you? Most fair Salassa, if e're truth Dwelt in a tongue, my words and thoughts are twins. Salas. You wrong your honor in so mean a choise. Can it be though, that that brave man, Valasco, Sole Champion of the world, should look on me? On me, a poor lone Widow? 'Tis impossible. Valas. I am poorer In my performance now, then ever; so poor, That vows and protestations want fit credit With me to vow the least part of a service That might deserve your favour. Salas. You are serious? Velas. Lady, I wish that for a present tryal, Against the custome of so sweet a nature, You would be somwhat cruel in commands. You dare not sift the honor of my faith By any strange injunction, which the speed Of my glad undertaking should not cheerfully Attempt, or perish in the sufferance of it. Salas. You promise Lordly. Velas. You too much distrust The constancy of truth. Salas. It were unnoble, On your part to demand a gift of bounty, More then the freedom of a fair allowance, Confirm'd by modesty and reason's warrant Might without blushing yeeld unto. Velas. Oh, fear not, For my affections aim at chast contents; Not at unruly passions of desire. I onely claim the title of your servant, The flight of my ambitions soars no higher, Then living in your grace, and for incouragement To quicken my attendance now and then A kinde unravisht kiss. Salas. That's but a see, Due to a fair deserver: but admit I grant it, and you have it; may I then Lay a light burthen on you. Velas. What is possible For me to venture on, by how much more It carries danger in't; by so much more My glorie's in the atchievement. Salas. I must trust ye. Velas. By all the vertues of a Souldiers name, I vow and sware. Salas. Enough, I take that oath: And thus my self first do confirm your warrant. Velas. I feel new life within me. Salas. Now be Steward, For your own store, my lord, and take possession Of what you have purchased freely. Velas. With a joy. As willing as my wishes can arrive at. kisses her. Salas. So, I may claim your oath now. Velas. I attend it. Salas. Velasco, I do love thee, and am jealous Of thy spirit, which is hourly apt To catch at actions; if I must be Mistris Of thee and my own will, thou must be subject To my improvements. Velas. 'Tis my souls delight. Salas. Y'are fam'd the onely fighting Sir alive; But what's this; if you be not safe to me. Velas. By all— Salas. you shall not sware, take heed of perjury. So much I fear your safety, that I command, For two years space, you shall not wear a sword, A dagger, or stelletto; shall not fight On any quarrel be it neer so just. Velas. Lady! Salas. Hear more yet; if you be baffled, Rail'd at, scorn'd, mock'd struck, baffl'd, kick'd, Velas. (O Lady!) Salas. Spit on, revil'd, challeng'd, provok'd by fools, Boyes, anticks, cowards. Velas. ('Tis intollerable.) Salas. I charge you (by your oath) not to reply. In word, deed, look: and lastly, I conjure ye Never to shew the cause to any living By circumstance or by equivocation; Nor till two years expire to motion love. Velas. Why do you play the Tyrant thus? Salas. 'Tis common T' observe how love hath made a Coward valiant; But that a man as daring as Velasco, Should to express his duty to a Mistris, Kneel to his own disgraces, and turn Coward, Belongs to me and to my glories onely; I'm Empress of this miracle. Your oath Is past, if you will lose your self you may. How d'ee, Sir? Velas. Woman thou art vain and cruel. Salas. Wilt please your lordship tast a cup of wine, Or stay and sup, and take a hard bed here? Your friends think we have done strange things this while. Come let us walk like Lovers: I am pittiful, I love no quarrels. Velas. Triumph in my ruins. There is no act of folly but is common In use and practise to a scornful woman. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act III. Enter Alphonso, Almada, Muretto, Bufo, Pynto, and attendants. Alph. You have prevail'd, yet e're you came (my Lord) Muretto, here this right, right, honest man Confirm'd me throughly, now to witness further With what a gratitude I love the Queen. Reach me a bowle of wine. Alm. Your Majesty more honors me, in making me the Messenger of this most happy concord, then addition of greatness can express. Muret. I ever told you, How you would his Grace, inclin'd at last Pyn. The very Jove of benignity, by whose gentle aspect the whole sphere of this Court and Kingdom are (like the lesser orbes) moved round in the harmony of affability. Enter one with wine. Alph. My Lord Almado, health unto your Mistris, A hearty health, a deep one. Alm. upon my knee My duty gladly answers drinks. Alph. Give him wine. There's not a man whoever in our Court (Greater or meaner) but shall pledge this health, In honor of our Queen, our vertuous Queen. Commend us, and report us as you finde. Alm. Great Sir, I shall with joy. Alph. Bufo and Pynto, All in, and drink, drink deep, let none be spar'd, Comers or goers, none. Buf. Away my hearts. Pyn. Wee'll tickle it till the welkin blussle again, and all the fixt Stars dance the old measures. Muret. I shall attend to wait upon your lordship to the Caraoch. Exeunt. Manet Alphonso. Alph. So, so, far reaching pollicy, I adore thee, Will hug thee as my dearling Shallow fools Dive not into the pitch of regular Statists. Henceforth my Stratagem's of scorn and hatred Shall kill in smiles. I will not strike and frown, But laugh and murther. Enter Muretto. Alph. Welcom, are we safe? Muret. Most free from interruption: The Lord Velasco is newly entred the Court; I have given the watch word that they ply him mainly; the conclusion (I know cannot but break off in hurleburly. Alph. Good, good, I hate him mortally. 'Twas he Slaved me to th' hangmans ax: But now go on; Petruchi is the man, you say, must stand The Champion of her lust. Muret. There may be yet vertuous intention even in bad actions, in lewd words, I urge no further then likelyhoods may inform. Alph. Phew, that's thy nobleness: But now Muretto, The eye of luxury speaks loud in silence. Muret. Why look ye, Sir, I must confess I observ'd some odd amorous glances, some sweet familiar courteous toying smiles; a kinde of officious boldness in him, Princelike and Queenlike allowance of that boldness in him again; sometimes I might warily overhear her whispers. But what of all this? There might be no harm meant. Alph. Fy, no, the grafting of my forehead, nothing else. Grafting, grafting, Muretto, A most Gentleman-like exercise; a very mystery belongs to't. And now and then they walk thus, arm in arm, twist fingers: ha. Would they not Muretto? Muret. 'Tis wondrous fit a great Queen should be supported, Sir; and for the best lady of 'em all, to discourse familiarly with her supporter, is courtly and passing innocent. Alph. She and Petruchi did so? Muret. And at her passing to her private lodgings, attended onely with her lady in ordinary. Petruchi alone went in before her. Alph. Is't true! Went in before her! Canst prove that? Muret. Your Majesty is too quick, too apprehensive of the worst: I meant he perform'd the office of an Usher. Alph. Guilty apparently: Monstrous woman! Beast! Were these the fruits of her dissembling tears! Her puling, and her heart sighs. But, Muretto. I will be swift Muretto, swift and terrible. Muret. I am such another Coxcomb; O my side too. Yet faith, let me perswade ye; I hope your wife is vertuous. Alph. Vertuous? The Devil she is, 'tis most impossible. What kiss and toy, wink, prate, yet be vertuous? Muret. Why not Sir? I think now a woman may lie four or five nights together with a man, and yet be chast; though that be very hard, yet so long as 'tis possible, such a thing may be. Alph. I have it, wee'll confer; let's stand aside. Enter Bufo and another Groom with wine, both drunk; Bufo handing Velasco by the shoulders. Buf. Not drink more? By this hand you shall drink eleven whole healths, if your cap be wooll or beaver; and that's my resolution. Gro. 'Sfoot, eleven score, without dishonor be it spoken to any mans person out of this place. Velas. Prethee, I can no more, 'tis a profession I dare not practice, nay, I will not. Buf. How will not? Not her Queenships health? Hark ye, thy stincking and unwholesom words— Will not—You will not—You say you will not? Velas. I say so, pray be answer'd. Gro. Pox of all flinchers; if a' say a will not, Let him chuse, like an arrant dry lord as he is. Buf. Give me the bowl, I must be valiant. You, Sirrah, man at arms; Here's a carouse To the King, the Queen, and my self. Gro. Let't come, I'll have that i'faith, Sweet, sweet, sweet, Captain. Buf. Hold, give the lord first, drink it up lord, do, ump. Velas. Away I say, I am not in the tune. Buf. Tune, tune? 'Sblood, d'ee take us for fiddlers, scrappers, rime canters by tune? By this light, I'll scourge ye like a town top: Look ye, I am urg'd— Ump—And there's a side blow for ye, like a sober thing as ye are. Gro. well done i'faith, precious Captain. Velas. Dar'st thou do this to me knowing who I am? Buf. Yes, in the way of daring, I dare kick you thus, thus, Sir up and down. There's a jolt on the bum too: How d'ee like it? Velas. 'Tis well! You use the priviledge of the place. There was a time the best of all this Court Durst not have lift a hand against me then. But I must bear it now. Alph. Is not this strange Muretto? Muret. I can scantly credit mine own eyes: The Captain follows his instructions perfectly. Buf. Not drink? Mahound, Infidel. I will fillip thy nose, spit in thy face, Mungrel; brave, a Commander, ha? Velas. O woman-woman-woman. Buf. That's a lie, a stark one, 'tis known I nere was a woman in my life. I am weary beating of him, and can stand no longer. Groom, kick him thou up and down in my behalf; or by this flesh I'll swinge you, sirrah. Gro. Come aloft, Jackanapes: come aloft, sirrah. kicks, beates him. Alph. Why sure Velasco dares not fight. Muret. It must be some or other hath bewitched him. Enter Pynto. Pyn. Avant, I saw twelve dozen of Cuckolds in the middle region of the air, galloping on a black Jack, Eastward ho. It is certain that every dozen went for a company, and they are now become a corporation. Aries and Taurus, the Bull and the Ram, two head signs, shall be henceforth their recognizances, set up in the grand hall of their politick convocations—whirr, whirr, there, there, just under the rainbow ambles Mercury, the thin bearded thief that stole away the Drappers wife, while the good man was made drunk at the Stillyard, at a beaver of Dutch bread and Renish wine, and lay all night in pure holland in's stocking and shoes. Pish, Talke not to me, I will maintain against the Universities of both the Indies, that one Aldermans horse is more right worshipful, then any six Constables, brown bills and all. Now, now, now, my brains burn in Sulphur, and thus will I stalk about, and swim through a whole Element of dainty, neat, brisk, rich claret, canary, or maligo. Am not I Pynto, have not I hiren here? What art thou, a full moon, or a moon calf? Buf. No, no, 'tis a dry Stock-fish, that must be beaten tender. Velas. Was ever man so much a slave as I? Pyn. Does Saturn wince? Down with him, let Charles his wayn run over his North pole; it shall be justified too. Gro. Now, Sir, having taken a little breath, have at ye once more, and I have done. Enter Mopas and Lodovico. Mop. Clubs, clubs, I have been the death of two Brewers horses, and two catch-poles, my self, and now be try'd by two fools and ten knaves: O monstrous base, horrible; is my lord past recovery? Velas. Hold, prethee, fellow hold, I have no sword, Or if I had, I dare not strike again. Buf. U'ds bones, were ye an invincible Armado, Ide pound ye all like brown paper rags. Lodov. Let me be strucken blind! The shame of fate; Velasco, baffled, and not dare to strike! Dogs, drunken dogs, I'll whip ye to your kennels. Velas. Nay good, forbear. Mop. Bilbo come forth and shew thy foxes tayl. Nay, nay, give me liquor, and I'll fight like a rorer. Pyn. Keep standing ho; the Almanack says plainly 'tis no season to be let blood, the sign is mortal. Hold! Alph. Yes I command. Uncivil ill bred beasts. How dares ye turn our pallace to a booth? How dare the proudest of ye all lift up A hand against the meanest of those creatures Whom we do own for ours? Now, now you spit The ancient rancor of you bitter galls Wherewith you strove to wound us heretofore. Lodov. We are abus'd, My Lord. Alph. Fellow, Thou lyest. Our Royal eyes beheld the pride and malice Of thee Velasco; who in hate to us Deny'st to honour our remembrance, though But in a pledg'd health. Velas. Therein I was wrong'd. Alph. No, therein all thy cunning could not hide The rage of thy malitious heart to us; Yet know, for tryal of thy love we caus'd This onset, we will justifie the hight Of thy disgraces; what they did was ours. Hence Coward, baffled, kickt, despis'd and spurn'd. Buf. Hang thy self; a pox on thee. Exit Alphonso, Muretto, Pynto, Bufo, Groom. Lodov. O y'are undon: What Devil, Hag, or Witch Hath stoln your heart away? Velas. I cannot tell. Lodov. Not fight 'tis enough to shame us all. Velas. Happy was I, that living liv'd alone, Velasco was a man then, now is none. Exeunt. Mop. Is't even so, no man now; then I smell how things stand: I'll lay my life, his lady sweet heart hath given him the Gleek, and he in return hath gelded himself, and so both lost his courage and his wits together. Exit. Enter Queen, Almado, Collumello, Petruchi and Herophil. Qu. Speak o're the words again; and good my lord Be sure you speak the same, the very words; Our Queen, our vetuous Queen; Was't so? Alm. Just so; And was withal in carriage so most kinde, So Princely, that I must do wrong to gratitude, In wanting action to express his love. Qu. I am the happiest she that lives. Petruchi, Was I mistook or no? Why good my lords, Observe it well. There is a holy league Confirm'd and ratify'd 'twixt Love and Fate. This sacred Matrimonial tye of hearts, Call'd marriage, has Divinity within't. Prethee, Almado, tell me, smil'd the King When he commended to me? Alm. Madam, yes; And affably concluded all in this; Commend us, and report us as you find. Qu. For loves sakes, no man prattle of distrust. It shall be treason whosoever says The King's unkinde. My thinks I am all air, My soul has wings. Petr. And we are all o'rejoy'd In this sweet reconciliation. Qu. Wee'll visit him (my Lords) in some rich mask Of rare device, as thus; Pish, now I think on't, The world yeelds not variety enough Of cost, that's worthy of his Royal eyes, Why Herophil? Her. Here, Madam. Qu. Now beshrew me But I could weep for anger—If 'twere possible To get a chariot cut out of a rock, Made all of one whole Diamond, drawn all on Pavements Of pearls and amber, by four Ivory steeds Of perfect Christal; this were worth presenting. Or some bright cloud of Saphirs—Fy you are all So dull, you do not love me. Col. Y'are transported To strange impossibilities: our service Shall wait upon your happiness. Qu. Nay, nay, I know you laugh at me, and well you may; I talk I know not what. I would 'twere fit To ask one queston of ye. All. Madam, any thing. Qu. You'l swear that I am Idle, yet you know 'Tis not my custom; Look upon me well; Am I as fair as Herophil? Petr. Yes, Madam, Or any other creature else alive. Qu. You make me blush in troth. O would the King Could see me with your eyes. Or would I were Much courser then I am to all the world; So I might onely seem more fair to him. Enter Velasco and Lodovico. See here come more. Velasco, thou art welcom. Welcom kinde Lodovico. You I know Bring fresh supplies of comfort; do not cloud Your news with circumstance: Say, doth the King Expect me? Yes, good man, I know he does. Speak briefly, good my Lord, and truly. Velas. Madam, Take all at once, he is the King; And Kings may do their pleasures. Qu. True, Velasco. But I have from my heart forgot remembrance Of former passages, the world is chang'd: Is a' not justly royal? Lodov. Would a' were, I wish it for your sake Madam, but my wishes and his inclinations are quite opposite. Petr. What said you, Lodovico? Lodov. Thus Petruchi. Velasco hath been by the King disgrac'd, by his minions abused, baffled, they justified by the King in't. In a word; Alphonso is, and will be the scourge of Arragon. Qu. I'll stop my ears, they shannot let in poyson, Rank treacherous searching poyson. Alm. 'Tis impossible. Qu. Yes, 'tis impossible; but now I see Y'are all agreed to curse me in the hight Of my prosperities. O that at once I could have leave to dye and shun the times. Enter Muretto. Muret. His excellent Majesty by me commends to your Royal hands this letter, Madam. Qu. Why thus I kiss, And kiss again; Welcom, what e'er it speaks. Muret. That you may all conceive (my Lords) the Kings hearty zeal to unity and goodness, he by me intreates your attendance on the Queen to him: To you Signior, Petruchi, he sends this Diamond from his own finger. Petr. You strike me into wonder. Muret. I should excuse his highness violence to you, my lord Velasco; but he says, that your own indiscretion deserv'd your late reproof: And futher, (pardon me that I mince not the sum of his injunction) he says your cowardice is now so vulgarly palpable, that it cannot stand with his honour to countenance so degenerating a spirit. Velas. I thank him; yet, if you remember well; Both he and you prov'd me another man. Qu. The sweetest letter that ever was writ: Come we must to the King—How! 'Tis my ring, The first ring that I ever gave the King. Petruchi, I must have it. Petr. 'Twas the King sent it: I mean to yeeld it back again. Qu. No I will. And in exchange take that of equal value; But not with me, 'cause it comes from my husband. Let's slack no time, this day shall crown our peace. Exit all but Velasco and Lodovico. Lodov. You see my Lord how the world goes. What your next course? Velas. Would I could leave my self, I am unfit For company of men: Art thou my friend? Lodov. I cannot tell what I am, your patient humor indeed perswades me I am nothing. Ladies little puppy dogs shortly will break your shins with milke-sops, and you dare not cry, come out cur. Faith tell me for our wonted frindships sake; hath not this Madam sweet heart of yours a share in your Meramorphosis? Velas. You are unkinde, as much as in a thought, To wrong her vertue. Lodovico, no; I have resolv'd never to fight again. Lodov. 'Tis a very safe resolution: but have you resolv'd never to be beaten again? Velas. That goodly sound of gallant valiant man Is but a breath, and dyes as soon as utter'd. I'll seek my fame henceforward in the praise Of sufferance and patience, for rash man-hood Adds onely life to cruelty, yet by cruelty Takes life away, and leaves upon our souls Nothing but guilt, while patience if it be Settl'd, doth even in bondage keep us free. Lodov. Excellent morality; but good my Lord, without more circumstance, the cause, let me know the ground and cause on't. Velas. My will, or if you please my cowardice, More ask not, more, I vow, you shall not know. Enter Mopas. Mop. O Fy, fy, I were better be the Hangmans deputy, then my Lord Velasco's Gentleman usher; all the streets as I pass whoot at me, and ask me if I be so valiant as my master the coward; they swear their children carry woodden daggers to play a prize with him, and there's no talk but of the arrant coward Velasco. Velas. I care not, let 'em talk. Mop. Care not? By these hilts, I had rather then a hundred ducates, I had but as much spirit: as to have drawn upon a couple of men in Ginger-bread, which a hucsters crook't legged whorson ape held up, and swore they were two taller fellows then you are. Lodov. Your readiest way were to get you into a cloyster; for there's no going to Court: Mop: Yes, to have our brains rubb'd out with the heel of a brown manchet. Velas. As, y'are my friend forbear to come more neer me. Exit Velasco. Lodov. Gone so quickly? Mopas I'll finde out this mystery, and thou shalt be the instrument. Mop. Shall I? Why agreed, let me alone for an instrument, be it a winde or string'd instrument, I'll sound at one end or other I'll warrant ye. Exeunt. Enter Alphonso, Pynto, Bufo. Alph. Are all things ready as we gave charge? Pyn. Yes all, and the face of the heavens are passing favourable. Alph. Bufo, Be it thy care, the watch word given, To seize Petruchi suddenly. Buf. If the Devil be not in him, I'll make him fast enough. Alph. Mean time wee'll take our place, they are at hand. Some sound our choisest musick t'entertain This Queen with all the seeming forms of State. Loud Musick. Enter Queen supported by Petruchi, Herophil, Collumello, Almada, and Muretto. All. All joy to Aragons great King. Alph. You strive to act in words (my lords) but we our self Indeavor rather how to speak in act. Now is a time of peace of amity. The Queen is present; Lady, seat you here, As neer, as if we plac'd you in our heart, Where you are deep in thron'd. Qu. As you in mine, So may I ever live in yours, my Lord. Alph. How so? You are too charitable now, That covet but equality in love; A cold, a frozen love; for I must think The streams of your affections are dry'd up, Or running from their wonted channels, range In lawless paths of secresie and stealth; Which makes us love you more. Qu. I would your words Dissented not from your resolved thoughts For then (if I mistake not) you would feel Extremity of passion, which indeed Is noble jealousie. Alph. Are you so plain? I thank you Madam; lend me your fair hand, What's here? O my presages! Whence got you this ring? Qu. This ring, my lord? Alph. This ring, my lord! By honours reverend crest 'tis time to wake. Art thou not pale, Petruchi? Petr. Gratious, Sir. This is the ring you sent me by Muretto, Which 'cause it came from you, the Queen would needs Exchange it for another of her own. Alph. True, 'cause it came from me, I take it so, And grant ye, know the word. 'Tis won and lost. Enter a Guard, Bufo with them seize Petruchi; Pynto the Queen. Petr. What mean ye, Helhounds? Slaves, let go my sword. Buf. Keep in your chaps, and leave scolding, my small friend, 'tis now no time to wrangle or to rore. Qu. Nay, nay, with what you please I am content. Col. What means your Highness? Alm. wronge not Majesty With such unnoble rigour. Alph. O, my lords, The weight of all this shame falls heaviest here In my afflicted bosome. Madman like I would not credit, what mine ears had heard, From time to time of that adulterous woman. For this have I liv'd widowed from her bed, Was deaf to proofs, to oaths, and ever thought That whoredom could not suit her self so trimly On vertues outside. But Petruchi there Hath a loud speaking conscience, can proclaim Her lust, and my dishonour Petr. Grant me hearing. Alph. Away with him to prison, make him fast On pain of all your lives. Buf. Come, Sir, there is no playing fast and loose, which fit a ducat now. Exit Bufo with Petruchi. Col. But what now for the Queen? Alph. As she deserves. Alm. Our law requires a clear and open proof, And a juditial trial. Alph. Yes to subjects It does, but who among you dares speak justice Against your natural Soveraign? Not one. Pyn. Your Majesty hath most wisely considered that point. Muret. I have stood silent all this while, and cannot but with astonishment and unutterable grief bear a share of sadness in these disasters. But, Madam, be not altogether dejected on your part: there is more mercy in this soveraign Prince, then that you should any way distrust. Qu. Nay, even proceed and question me no more. Alph. I will be gentle to you, and the course That I will take shall merit your best thanks. If in a moneth a Champion shall appear, In single opposition to maintain Your honor; I will be the man my self In person to avouch this accusation: And which of us prevails, shall end this strife. But if none come, then you shall lose your head. Mean time your usage shall be like a Queen. Muret. Now by the life of honour, 'tis a most Princely tryal, and will be worth you eternal memory. Qu. Where must I then be led! Alph. No where but here In our own palace; and as I am King, None worse then I shall be her Guardian. Alm. Madam, Heaven is the Guardian of the just; You cannot miss a Champion. Qu. E're I go, May I entreat a word? Alph. O yes, you may. Qu. Collumello and Almado, hear me, I speak to you, and to your felow Peers, Remember both by oaths and by allegiance You are my subjects. Both. Madam, true, we are. Qu. Then as you ever bore respect or truth To me as to your Soveraign, I conjure ye Never to levy arms against the King, Singly or openly, and never else To justifie my right or wronge in this. For if you do, here I proclaim ye all Traytors to loyalty and me: for surety, I crave your oaths a new. Both. Since you enforce us, We sware: and heaven protect you. Qu. Let me be gone. Alph. Well as they please for that: Muretto, follow. Exit all but Almada and Collummello. Alm. Here is fine work, my lord. What's to be done? Col. Stand still while this proud Tyrants cuts our throats. Alm. She's wrong'd, and this is onely but a plot. Velasco, now might binde his Country to him; But he is grown so cowardly and base, That boys and children beat him as they list. Col. I have be thought me, we, with th' other Peers, Will set a proclamation out, assuring What worthy Knight soever undertakes, By such a day, as Champion for the Queen. Shall have a hundred thousand ducats paid, Withal, what honors else he shall demand. Alm. This must be speeded, or 'twill come to late. Col. It shall be suddain: Here our hope must stand; Kings command Subjects; Heav'n doth King's command. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IV. Enter Salassa and Shaparoon. Salas. A coward? 'tis impossible; Velasco a coward? The brave man? The wonder of the time? Sure, Shaparoon, 'tis a meer scandal rais'd by an enemy. Shap. 'Tis most certain, most apparent; Taylors, Prentizes, nay, Bakers and Weavers; (things that drink cannot put spirit into, they are such mighty bread-eaters) they as I am an honest woman, fling old shoes at him, and he dares not turn back to give an angry word. Salas. I had been sweetly promoted to such a tame Champion. Shap. Gallants! Out upon 'em, 'tis your tough clown is your only raiser up of man or woman. Salas. A Proclimation is sent out for certain? Shap. Most assuredly. Salas. The sum proposed, a hundred thousand ducats. Shap. Present payment, without attendance. Salas. 'Tis a glorious reward—speak low, and observe. Enter Mopas reading a Proclamation. Mop. Whosoever, man or woman, can, or will procure any such foresaid defendant, against the said day; let them, him, or she repair to the said lords of the Councel, and give in such sufficient assurance for such defence, and they or any of them shall receive a hundred thousand ducats in ready cash; with what honors may give them, him, or her content or satisfaction. O that I durst be valiant: A hundred thousand. A hundred thousand; how it rumbles in my chops. Salas. Prethee, a word, my friend. Mop. Sweet Lady, all fair weather up on ye. As for you, Madam, time was, I recommend to your ancient remembrance, time is past: with my service forwards and backwards, when 'tis time present, resting yours in the whole Mopas. Shap. Very courtly and pithy. Salas. Pray let me view your paper. Mop. 'Tis your ladiships. Shap. Some proclamation as I take it. Mop. Madam Reverence, you have taken it in the right cue. Salas. I am o'rejoy'd; there's gold for thy news. Friend. I will make thee the happiest and most welcom messenger to thy lord, that ever received thanks from him; without delay, wait on me for instructions. Mop. I am at your ladiships beck. Exeunt. Enter Alphonso, and Muretto. Muret. True, true, Sir, you are set high upon the stage for action. O the top of my ambition, my hearts Idol! What a perplexity are you twin'd into? And justly; so justly, that it is hard to judge, whether your happiness were greater in the possession of an unmatchable beauty, or your present misery, by inforcing that beauty to expose her honor to so apparent a contempt: This is not the least, that might have been in time prevented. Alph. O I am lost Muretto, my sunke eyes Are buried in their hollows: busie thoughts Press on like legions of infernal hags To menace my destruction: Yet my judgment Still prompts my senses, that my Queen is fair. Muret. Fair! Unspeakable workmanship of Heavens bounty. Were all the skilfullest Painters that ever discern'd colours, moulded into one, to perfect an Artist. Yet that Artist should sooner want fansie or imagination, for personating a curious medal, then ever to patern a counterfeit so exquisitely excellent, as is the Queen by nature. Alph. I have surveyed the wonder of her cheeks, Compar'd them wth the lillies and the rose And by my life, Muretto, Roses are Adulterate to her blush, and lilies pale, Examin'd with her white; yet, blear eyed fool, I could not see those rarities before me. Muret. Every man is blind (my lord) in his own happiness, there's the curse of our mortality. She was the very tale of the world: Her perfections busied all tongues. She was the onely wish of Europes chiefest Monarchs. Whose full fruition you (and 'twas your capital sin) most inhumanly abandoned. Alph. Villain, Petruchi, let me for ever curse him: Had he not been the man; who else had durst to hazard a denyal from her scorns? Muret. See now herein you are monstrous discourteous, above excuse; why, Sir, what hath Petruchi done? Which (from any King to a Vassal) al men would not eagerly have persued. Alas, my lord, his nobleness is eternal, by this means, in attempting and his felicity unmatchable, in injoying the glory of his time, a beau so conquering, so unparalell'd. Alph. She is superlative. Muret. Divine. Alph. Rich, bright. Muret. immortal. Alph. Too too worthy for a man. Mur. The Gods might enjoy her. Alph. Nature ne're fram'd so sweet a creature. Muret. She is self Nature's Nature. Alph. Let me for ever curse the frail condition Of our deluded faculties: Muretto, Yet being all, as she is all, her best Is worst considering that she is a wanton. Muret. Build you a Palace, arch it with Diamonds, roof it with Carbuncles, pave it with Emraulds, daub it with Gold, furnish it with all what cost can lay on, and then seal up the doors, and at best 'tis but a solitary nest for Owles and Daws. Beauty was not meerly created for wonder, but for use: 'Tis you were in the fault; 'tis you perswaded her, urg'd, compell'd, inforc'd her: I know it, my truth and plainness trumpets it out to ye: Besides, women (my lord) are all creatures, not Gods nor Angels. Alph. I must confess 'tis true, yet by my Crown She dyes, if none defend her, I'm resolv'd. Muret. 'Tis a heroical disposition, and with your honour she cannot, must not live. Here's the point; If she live and you receive her to favour, you will be a noted Cuckold; which is a recognizance dishonorable to all, but to a King fearfully infamous. On the other side, if you prevail, and she be put to death, you do as it were deprive the Firmanent of the Sun, and your self of the treasure of the whole earth. Alph. Right, right, Muretto, there thou strik'st the wound Too deeply to be cur'd, yet I must do't. I would fain see her now. Muret. Pray do, Sir; and let Petruchi come face to face to her; observe them both, but be very mild to both: use extremity to neither. Alph. Well counsell'd; call them hither, but none with them: Wee'll strive with grief; Heaven! I am plung'd at full. Never henceforward shall I slumber out One peaceful hour; my enraged blood Turns coward to mine honour. I could wish My Queen might live now though I did but look And gaze upon her cheeks, her ravishing cheeks. But, oh, to be a Cuckold; 's death, she dyes. Enter at one door Petruchi, and the other Muretto and the Queen, they stand at several ends of the Stage. Muret. My gratious Lord. Alph. Reach yond fair sight a chair, That man a stool, sit both, wee'll have it so. Mur. 'Tis Kingly done; in any case (my lord) curb now a while the violence of your passion, and be temperate. Qu. Sir, 'tis my part to kneel, for on your brow I read sad sentence of a troubled wrath, And that is argument enough to prove my guilt, not being worthy of your favour. Petr. Let me kneel too, though not for pardon, yet In duty to this presence: else I stand As far from falsehood, as is that from truth Muret. Nay, Madam, this not the promise on your part. It is his pleasure you should sir. Qu. His pleasure is my law. Alph. Let him sit too, the man, Both sit. Petr. Sir, you are obey'd. Alph. Between my comforts and my shame I stand In equal distance; this way let me turn To thee thou woman. Let me dull mine eyes With surfeit on thy beauty. What art thou Great dazeling splendor? Let me ever look And dwell upon this presence. Muret. Now it works. Alph. I am distract. Say? What! Do not, do not— Muret. My lord the King—Why, Sir?— He is in a trance, or else metamorphis'd to some some pillar of marble: How fixedly a' stands. D'ee hear, Sir? What d'ee dream on? My lord, this is your Queen speak to her. Alph. May I presume with my irreverent lips To touch your sacred hand. Qu. I am too wretched To be thought but the subject of your mirth. Alph. Why she can speak, Muretto? O tell me pray, And make me ever, ever fortunate; Are you a mortal creature? Are ye indeed Moulded of flesh and blood like other women? Can you be pittiful? Can ye vouchsafe To entertain fair parley? Can you love, Or grant me leave to love you; can you, say? Qu. You know too well, my lord, instead of granting, I ow a duty, and must sue to you, If I may not displease. Alph. Now I am great, You are my Queen, and I have wrong'd a merit, More then my service in the humblest lowness Can ever recompence. I'll rather wish To meet whole hosts of dangers, and encounter The stabled whips of steel, then ever part From those sweet eyes: not time shall sue divorce 'Twixt me and this great miracle of Nature. Muretto? Muret. Soveraign Sir. Alph. I'll turn away, And mourn my former errors—Worse then death Look where a Basilisk with murthering flames Of poyson, strikes me Blinde. Insatiate tempter, Patern of lust, 'tis thou alone hast sundred Our lawful bride bed, planted on my crest The horned Satyrs badge; hast soyl'd a beauty As glorious, as sits yonder on her front. Kill him, Muretto, why should he receive The benefit of the law, that us'd no law In my dishonours? Petr. Were you more a King Then Royalty can make you, though opprest By your commanding powers, yea, and curb'd In bonds most falsely, yet, give me a sword And strip me to my shirt, I will defend Her spotless vertue, and no more esteam, In such a noble cause, an host of Kings, Then a poor stingless swarm of buzzing flies. Qu. Petruchi, in those words thou dost condemn Thy loyalty to me, I shall disclaim All good opinion of thy worth or truth, If thou persevere to affront my lord. Petr. Then I have done. Here's misery unspeakable; Rather to yeeld me guilty wrongfully, Then contradict my wrongs. Alph. High impudence. Could she be ten times fairer then she is, Yet I would be reveng'd. You sweet, I would Again—Her beams quite blast me. Muret. If you will be an Eaglet of the right aery, you must endure the Sun. Can you chuse but love her? Alph. No by the Stars. Why would not you be honest; and know how I do dote? Qu. May I be bold To say I am, and not offend? Alph. Yes, yes, Say so for heavens love, though you be as fowl As sin can black your purity. Yet tell me That you are white and chast; That while you live The span of your few dayes, I may rejoyce In my deluded follies; least I dye Through anguish, e're I have reveng'd my injury, And so leave you behind me for another; That were intollerable. Qu. Heaven knows, I ne're abus'd my self or you. Petr. As much sware I, and truly. Alph. Thou proud Devil, Thou hast a lying tongue; They are consented In mischief. Get ye hence seducing horrors. I'll stop mine eyes and ears till you are gone. As you would be more merciful, away, Or as you would finde mercy. Ex. Queen Petruchi contrary waies. Muret. Sir, they are gone. Alph. And she too then let me be seen no more. I am distracted, both waies I seel my blame; To leave her death, to live with her is shame. Exit. Muret. Fare ye well King, this is admirable, I will be chronicled, all my business ripens to my wishes. And if honest intentions thrive so successfully; I will henceforth build upon this assurance, that there can hardly be a greater Hell or Damnation, then in being a Villane upon earth. Exit. Enter Lodovico, Salassa, Shaparoon. Lodov. I am wonder stricken—And were you i'faith the she indeed, that turn'd my Lords heart so handsomly, so cunningly? O how I reverence wit. Well, lady, you are as pestilent a piece of policy, as ever made an ass of love. Salas. But, Lodovico, I'll salve all again quickly. Shap. Yes indeed forsooth, she has the trick on't. Lodov. You have undertaken with the lords already, you say. Salas. I have, and my life is at stake, but I fear not that. Lodov. Pish, you have no need; one smile, or kinde simper from you does all; I warrant ye the sight of so much gold, as you are to receive, hath quickned your love infinitely. Salas. Why, Sir, I was not worthy of my lords love before; I was too poor: but now two hundred thousand ducats, is a dower fit for a lord. Lodov. Marry is't. I applaud your consideration. 'Twas neatly thought on. Enter Collumello and Almada. Col. Have you prevail'd yet, lady, time runs on, You must not dally. Salas. Good my lords, fear nothing: Were it but two hours to't, I should be ready. Enter Velasco very sad. Lodov. He comes himself, 'tis fit we stood unseen. Ply him soundly, lady. Alm. Let us withdraw then. Exeunt. Velas. I cannot be alone, still I am hunted With my confounding thoughts: Too late I finde, How passions at their best are but sly traytors To ruin honour. That which we call love, Was by the wisest power above forethought To check our pride. Thus when men are blown up At the highest of conceit, then they fall down Even by the peevish follies of their 'frailties. Salas. The best of my lord Velasco's wishes ever. Crown him with all true content. Velas. Cry ye mercy, Lady. Salas. I come to chide you my Lord; can it be possible that ever any man could so sincerely profess such a mightiness of affection, as you have done to me, and forget it all so soon, and so unkindely. Velas. Are you a true very lover, or are you bound For pennance to walk to some holy shrine In visitation? I have seen that face. Salas. Have you so? O you are a hot lover; a woman is in fine case to weep out her eyes for so uncertain a friend, as your protestations urg'd me to conceive you: But come I know what you'll say aforehand, I know you are angry. Velas. Pray give me leave to be my own tormentor. Salas. Very angry, extreamly angry; But as I respect perfection, tis more then I deserve. Little know you the misery I have endured, and all about a hasty word of nothing, and I'll have it prove nothing e're we part. Velas. Her pride hath made her lunatick, alas! She hath quite lost her wits, those are the fruits Of scorns and mockeries. Salas. To witness how indearedly I prefer your merits, and love your person; in a word, my lord, I absolve you, and set you free from the injunction I bound you in; as I desire to thrive, I meant all but for a tryal in jest. Velas. these are no words of madness; whither tends The extremity of your invention, Lady? I'll swear no more. Salas. I was too blame, but one fault (me thinks) is to be pardoned, when I am yours and you firmly mine: I'll bear with many in you. Velas. So, if you be in earnest; What's the matter? Salas. The sum of all is, that I know it suits not with the bravery of the lord Velasco's spirit, to suffer his Queen and soveraign stand wrongfully accused of dishonour, and dye shamefully for a fault never committed. Velas. Why 'tis no fault of mine. Salas. Nor shall it be of mine: Go be a famous subject; be a ransomer of thy Queen from dangers, be registred thy Countries patron: Fight in defence of the fairest and innocentest princess alive: I with my heart release you. First conquer; that done, enjoy me ever for thy wife: Velasco, I am thine. Velas. Pish, you release me, all their cunning strains Of policy that set you now a work, To treble ruin me, in life, fame, foul, Are foolish and unable to draw down A greater wrath upon my head; in troth You take a wrong course lady. Salas. Very good, Sir, 'tis prettily put off, and wondrous modestly, I protest; no man hath enjoyn'd me to this task 'tis onely to do service to the State, and honour to you. Velas. No man enjoyn'd you but your self? Salas. None else, as I ever had truth in me. Velas. Know then from me, you are a wicked woman, And avarice, not love to me, hath forc'd ye To practice on my weakness. I could raile, Be most uncivil; But take all in short: I know you not. Salas. Better and better, the man will triumph anon sure; Prethee, good dissemble no longer; I say you shall fight, I'll have it so: I command you fight, by this kiss you shall. Velas. Forbear, let me in peace bid you forbear; I will be henceforth still a stranger to you, Ever a stranger, look, look up, up there My oath is bookt, no humane power can free me. Salas. I grant you none but I. Velas. Be not deceived, I have Forgot your scorns; you are lost to me, Witness the Genius of this place, how e're You tempt my constancy, I dare not fight. Salas. Not dare to fight, what not for me? Velas. No Lady. I durst not, must not, cannot, will not fight. Salas. O me undone. Velas. What ayles you? Salas. Now my life Hath run it's last for I have pawn'd it Sir To bring you forth as champion for the Queen. Velas. And so should have the promis'd Gold. Salas. I, I. Velas. You have reveng'd my wrongs upon your selfe. I cannot helpe you, nay alas you know It lay nor in me. Salas. O take pitty on mee, Look heer, I hold my hands up, bend my knees, Heaven can require no more. Velas. Then kneel to heaven I am no God, I cannot do you good. Salas. Shall not my tears prevayle? hard-hearted Man. Dissembler, loves dishonour, bloody butcher Of a poor Lady, be assured my Ghost Shall haunt thy soule when I am dead. Velas. Your curse Is falne upon youur own head, herein show A noble piety, to beare your death With resolution, and for finall answer Lady I will not fight to gain the world. Exit. Salas. Gone! I have found at length my just reward, And henceforth must prepare to welcom Death. Velasco I begin to love thee now. Now I perceave thou art a noble man, Compos'd of Goodnes, what a foole was I? It grieves me more to loose him then to die. Enter Almada, Columello, Lodovico, Shaproon. Coll. Lady we have heard all that now hath past, You have deceav'd your selfe and us, the time We should have spent in seeking other means. Is lost, of which you are the cause. Alm. And for it The senats strickt decree craves execution, what can you say? Salas. My Lords I can no more but yeild me to the law. Shap. O that ever you were born, you have made a sweet hand on't, have you not. Lodov. Here is the right recompence of a vain confidence, Mistresse: But I will not torture you being so neer your end, lady say your prayers and die in Charity, that's all the pitty I can take on ye Exit Lodovico. Coll. Ten times the gold you should have had, now Lady cannot release you. Alm. You alone are shee Ruins your country. Heres the price of sin, Ill thrift, all loose in seeking all to win. Exit. all but shaproon. Shap. Nay even go thy ways, 'tis an old proverbe that leachery and covetousnes go together, and 'tis a true one too, But I'le shift for one. If some proper squire or Iustly yeoman have a mind to any thing I have about me, 'a shall soon know what to trust too for I see the times are very troublesome. Enter Pynto. Pyn. Now is the prosperous season when the whole round of the planets are coupling together. Let birds and beasts observe valentines day, I am a man and all times are with me in season, this same Court ease hath sett my blood on tiptoe, I am Madder then a march hare. Shap. Blessing on your fair face, your handsome hand, your clean foot sir, are you a Courtier sir? Pyn. Good starrs direct me, sweet woman, I am a Courtier, if you have any suit, what is't, what is't? be short. Shap. Lord what a Courteous proper man 'a is, trust me, 'a hath a most eloquent beard.—Suit Sir, Yes Sir, I am a countrey gentlewoman by father and Mothers side, one that comes to see fashions and learne newes. And How I pray sir (if I may be so bold to aske) stand things at Court Sir now a dayes? Pyn. A very modest necessary and discreet Question. Indeed Mistris Countrey-Gentlewoman, things at Court stand as they were ever wont, some stiffe and some slacke, every thing according to the imployment it hath. Shap. Mary, the more pitty sir, that they have not all good doing a like, methinkes, they should be all and at all times ready heer. Pyn. You speake by a figure, by your leave, in that. But because you are a stranger, I will a litte more amply informe you. Heer at our Court of Arragon, Schollars for the most part are the veriest fooles for that they are allways, beggerly and prowd. And foolish citizens the wisest schollars for that they never run at charges for greater learning to cast up their reck'nings, then their Horn-book. Here every old lady is cheaper then a proctor, and will as finely convey an open act, without any danger of a consistory. Love and money sweepes all before them, be they cut or longtayle. Do not I deserve a kisse for this discovery Mistris. Shap. A kisse, O my dear chastity, yes indeed forsooth, and I pray please your selfe. Pyn. Good wench by venus, but are you any thing rich? Shap. Rich enough to serve my turn. Pyn. I see you are reasonable fair. Shap. I ever thought my selfe so. Pyn. Will you survey my lodgings? Shap. At your pleasure sir being under your gard as I am. Enter Mopas and Bufe. Buf. Sirrha Mopas, If my mistresse say but the word, thou shalt see what an exployt, I will doe. Mop. You'le undertake it you saw, though your throat be cut in your own defence, 'tis but manslaughter, you can never be hang'd for it. Buf. Nay I am resolute in that point, heer's my hand, let him shrinke, that list, I'le not flinch a hayres breadth Mopas. Mop. What, old huddle and twang so close at it, and the dog dayes so neer, Heark ye, your lady is going the way of all flesh. And so is that schollar with you methinkes, though not in the same cue, is 'a not? Shap. 'A has promist to tell me my fortune at his chamber, and do me some other good for my ladies safety. Pyn. I have spoken, the planers shall be rul'd by me, Captain, you know they shall. Buf. Let the planets hang themselves in the elements, what cared, I have other matters to trouble my braines. Mop. Signior Pynto take her to you, as true a mettall'd blade as ever was turn'd into a dudgion, hearke in your eare. Enter Lodovico and Herophill. Lodov. I know not how to trust you, you ar all so fickle so unconstant. Herop. If I faile Let me be mark't a Strumpet. Lodov. I apprehend you use him kindly still, See where 'a is, Captain you are well mett, Her'es one whose heart you have. Herop. He knowes he has. Buf. Why by my troth I thanke you forsooth, 'tis more of your curtesie then my deserving, but I shall study to deserve it. Herop. I hope so, and doubt it not. Lodov. Madam Cosen Shaproon. Shap. You are welcom sir. Pyn. Cosen, Nay then I smell she is a gentlewoman indeed. Mop. Yes, and as antiently descended as Flesh and blood can derive her. Pyn. I am a made man and I will have her. Herop. You'le walke with me sir? Buf. Even through fire and water. sweet Mistres. Lodov. Let's every one to what concerns us most, For now's the time all must be sav'd or lost, Exeunt all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act V. A Scaffold Enter Velasco and Lodovico. Velas. This is not kindly done, nor like a friend. Lodov. Keep your chamber then, what should owles and barts do abroad by day light? why, you are become so notoriously ridiculous, that a Craven is reputed of nobler spirit amongst birds, then Velasco among men. Velas. Why Lodovico dost thou tempt my wrongs? O friend, 'tis not an honor or a fame Can be a gain to me, though I should dare To entertain this Combatt, say my fate Did crown mine arm with conquest of the King, Put case the cause add glory to the justice Of my prevaling sword? what can I win? Saving a pair of lives I lose a soule, My rich soule Lodovico, Does not yet The heart even shrill within thee? All thy spirits Melt into Passions, All thy manhood stagger Like mine? Nay canst thou chuse but now confess That this word Coward is a name of Dignity? Lodov. Faint hearts and strong toungs are the tokens of many a tall prattling Ghossipe. Yet the truth is you have halfe convinced me, But to what end will you be a looker on the Tragedy of this shee Beast? it will but breed your greater vexation. Velas. I hope not so, I looke for Comfort in't. Lodov. Mass: that may be too, It cannot but make your melancholy a little merry, to see the woodcockes neck caught in a worse noose, then shee had set for you. Velas. That's but a poor revenge, I'de rather weep On her behalfe, but that I hope her courage Will triumph over Death. Lodov. My Lord they come. Velas. Let me stand back unseen, Good Angells guard her. Velasco Muffles himselfe. Enter executioner before Salassa, her Hayre loose, after her, Almada, Collumello and officers. Alm. Tis a sad welcom. To bid you welcome to the stroak of Death. Yet you are come too't Lady. Coll. And a curse Throughout the land will be your generall knell, For having bin the wilfull overthrow, First of your Countreys Champion, next your Queen, Your Lawfull Soveraign, who this very day. Must act a part which you must act before, but with less guilt. Alm. Use no long speeches lady, The danger of the time, calls us away, We cannot listen to your farewells now. Sal. I have few words to say, my heart is lodg'd In yon same upper Parliament, yet now If ere I part, and shall be seen no more, Some man of mercy could but truly speake One word of pardon from the Lord Velasco, My peace were made in earth, and I should fly With wings of speed to Heaven. Alm. Pish here's not any. Salas. Not any? on then, why should I prolong A minute more of life, that live so late, Where most I strive for love to purchace hate, Beare witnes Lords I wish not to call back My younger dayes in promise that I would Redeem my fault and do Velasco right, But could I but reverse the doom of time, I would with humblest suit make prayers to heaven For his long florishing welfare. Col. Dispatch, dispatch; You should have thought on this before, pray now For your own health, for you have need to pray. Lodov. Madam Salassa, I am bold to take leave of ye before your long journey: All the comfort that I can give you is, that the weather is like to hold very fair, you need not take much care for either hood or cloke for the matter. Salas. Are you come? Worthy Sir, then I may hope Your noble friend hath sent one gentle sigh To grace my funeral: For vertues sake Give me a life in death; tell me, O tell me, If he but seal my pardon, all is well. Lodov. Say ye so? Why then in a word, go merrily up the stayers; my lord Velasco desires Heaven may as heartily forgive him, as he does you. Salas. Enough, I thank his bounty, on I go goes up the Scaffold. To smile on horror: so, so, I'm up. Great in my lowness, and to witness further My humbleness, here let me kneel and breath My penitence: O women in my fall, Remember that your beauties, youth and pride Are but gay tempters, 'less you wisely shun The errors of your frailties: let me ever Be an example to all fickle dames, That folly is no shrine for vertuous names. Heaven pardon all my vanities, and free The lord Velasco, what e're come of me. Bless, bless, the lord Velasco.—Strike. As he is about to strike, Velasco steps out. Velas. Villain, hold, hold! Or thou dyest, Slave. Alm. What means that countermand? Lodov. Hey, do! More news yet, you will not be valiant when 'tis too late, I trust? Velas. Woman, come down: Who lends me now a sword? Lodov. Marry, that do I, Sir, I am your first man; Here, here, here, take heed you do not hurt your fingers; 'twill cut plaguely: and what will you do with it? Velas. Base woman, take thy life, thy cursed life, I set thee free, and for it pawn a soul: But that I know heaven hath more store of mercy, Then thou and all thy sex of sin and falsehood. My Lords, I now stand Champion for the Queen: Doth that discharge her? Col. Bravest man, it doth: Lady, y'are safe; now, Officers away. This is a blessed hour! Ex. Officers. Alm. You shall for ever Bind us your servants. Lodov. Aha: Why then, however things happen, let them fall, as they fall. God a' mercy, my lord, at last. Col. Hark how the people ring apeal of joy, Shout within. For this good news. My lord, time steals away; We may not linger now. Salas. You give me life; Take it not, Sir, away again. I see Upon your troubled eyes such discontent As frights my trembling heart; Dear Sir— Velas. The Gold You hazarded your life for, is your own, You may receive it at your pleasure. Alm. Yes, 'Tis ready for you, lady. Salas. Gold? Let gold, And all the treasures of the earth besides Perish like trash; I value nothing, Sir, But your assured love. Velas. My love! Vain woman, Henceforth thus turn I from thee, never look For Apish dotage, for a smile, a how d'ee, A fare ye well, a thought from me: let Snakes Live in my bosom, and with muderous stinges Infect the vital warmth, that lends them life, If ever I remember thee or thine. If I prevail, my services shall crave But one reward, which shall be, if that ever Thou come but in my sight, the State wil please To banish thee the land; or else I vow, My self to leave it. Salas. My ill purchast life! Velas. Ill purchast life, indeed, whose ransom craves A sadder price, then price of bloodshed saves. Go, learn bad woman, what it is, how foul, By gaining of a life, to lose a soul. The price of one oul doth exceed as far A life here, as the Sun in light a Star. Here though we live some threescore years, or more, Yet we must dye at last, and quit the score We ow to nature. But the soul once dying, Dyes ever, ever; no repurifying; No earnest sighs or grones; no intercession; No tears; no pennance; no too late confession Can move the ear of justice, if it doom A soul past cure to an infernal tomb. Make use of this Salassa. Lodov. Think upon that now, and take heed, you look My lord no more in the face. Salas. Goodness protect him! now my life so late I strove to save, which being sav'd I hate. Exeunt all. Enter Alphonso armed all save the head, leading the Queen, a Herauld going before, Muretto, Herophil, a Guard. Alph. Are you resolv'd to dye? Qu. When life is irksom Death is a happiness. Alph. Yes, if the cause Make it not infamous: But when a beauty So most incomparable as yours, is blemish'd With the dishonorable stamp of whoredom: When your black tainted name, which should have been (Had you preserv'd it nobly) your best Chronicle, Wherein you might have liv'd, when this is stain'd, And justly too; then death doth but heap Affliction on the dying. Yet you see With what a sympathie of equal grief. I mourn your ruine. Qu. Would you could as clearly Perceive mine innocence, as I can clearly Protest it. Alph. Fy to justify a sin Is worse then to commit it, now y'are faulty. Muret. What a royall pair of excellent creatures are heer both upon the castaway. It were a saint like mercy in you (my Lord) to remitt the memory of a past errour. And in you Madam (if you be guilty of the supposed crime) to submitt your selfe to the King. I dare promise, his love to you is so unfayned, that it will relent in your humility. Pray do, good Madam do. Qu. But how if I be free? Muret. By any means, for your honors cause do not yeeld then one jot. Let not the faint feare of Death deject you before the royalty of an erected heart. D'ee heare this my Lord, 'tis a doubtfull case, almost impossible to be decided, Look upon her well, as I hope to prosper, shee hath a most vertuous, a most innocent countenance. Never heed it. I know my Lord your jealousy and your affections wrestle together within you for them astery. Mark her beauty throughly. Now by all the power of Love, tis pitty Shee should not be as fair within as without. Alph. Could that be prov'd, I'de give my kingdom straight And live a slave to her, and her perfections. Enter Almada, Columello, Attendants. Lords welcome, see thus arm in arm we pace To the wide theater of blood and shame My Queen and I, my Queen? had shee bin still As shee was, mine, we might have liv'd too happ'ly, For eithers comfort. Heer on this sweet modell, This plott of wonder, this fair face, stands fixt My whole felicity on earth. In witnes Whereof, behold (my Lords) those manly tears Which her unkindnes and my cruell fate Force from their quiet springs, They speak alowd To all this open ayre, their publick eyes, That whither I kill or dy in this attempt I shall in both be vanquisht. Alm. 'Tis strange my Lord Your love should seem so mighty in your hatred. Alph. Muretto go, and guard Petruchy safe. Exit Muretto. We must be stout now, and give over whineing. He shall confesse strange things (my Lords) I warrant ye, Comes not a champion yet? Qu. None dares I hope. Coll. The Queen you know, hath bound us all by Oath, We must not undertake to combat you Although the cause should prove apparent for her. Alph. Must not? why then y'are cowards all, all base, And fall off from your duties, but you know Her follies are notorious, none dare's stand To justify a sin, they see so playnely. Coll. You are too hard a censurer. Alph. Give me your hand, farewell, thus from my joy's I part, I ever part, Yet good my Lords, Place her on yonder throne, where shee may sit Just in mine eye, that so if strength should fail, I might fetch double strength from her sweet beauty. I'le heare no answers. Qu. Heaven be always guard To Noble actions place the Queen. Coll. Heer's a medley love That kills in Curtesie. Alph. Herauld sound a warning to all defendants— trumpet sounds. What comes no one forth: How like you this my Lords? Sirrah sound again. Second sound. A Trumpet within Enter herauld sounding, after him Velasco arm'd all save the head, Lodovico and attendants. Velasco? ha? art thou the man? although Thy cowardice hath publisht thee so base, As that it is an injury to honour To fight with one that hath been baffl'd scorn'd, Yet I will bid thee welcom. Velas. Nobly spoken. Past times can tell you sir, I was no coward, And now the justice of a gallant quarrell Shall new revive my dulnes, Yonder sits A Queen as free from stain, of your disgrace, As you are fowle in urging it. Alph. Thou talk'st couragiously, I love thee for it, And, if thou canst make good what thou avouchest, I'le kneel to thee, as to another nature Velas. We come not heer to chide, My sword shall thunder The right for which I strike. Qu. Traytor to loyalty, Rash and unknown fool, what desperate lunacy Hath led thee on to draw thy treacherous sword Against thy King, upon a ground so giddy That thou art but a stranger in the cause Thou wouldst defend, By all my royall blood If thou prevailst, thy head shal answer it. Coll. Madam you wrong his truth, and your own fame. Alm. You violate the liberty of armes. Alph. Pish, listen not to her, 'tis I'me your man. Qu. Why foolish Lords, unsensible and false, Can any drop of blood be drawn from him My Lord, your King, which is not drawn from me? Velasco by the duty that thou ow'st me I charge thee to lay by thy armes. Velas. I must not, Unles this man whom you call king, confess That he hath wrong'd your honor. Qu. Wilt thou fight then When I command the contrary? Velas. I will. Qu. Velasco. heare me once more, thou were wont To be as pittifull as thou wert valiant, I will entreat thee gentle kind Velasco, A weeping Queen sues to thee, Doe not fight, Velasco, every blow thou givest the King, Wounds mee, didst ever love? Velasco hear me. Alph. Shee must not be endur'd. Velas. Nor can shee win me, Blush you my Lord at this. Qu. O let me dy Rather then see my Lord affronted thus Queen falls into a sound. Velas. Hold up the Queen, she swouns. Alm. Madam Deare Madam. Coll. Can you see her and not be toucht my Lord? Was ever woman false that lov'd so truly Alph. 'Tis all dissimulation. Velas. You dishonour her, To prove it I'le fight both quarrels now. Enter a herauld sounding a trumpett, after him Petruchi arm'd head and all. Lodov. Heydo? here comes more work for mettall men. Alm. Another who should he be? Alph. Speake what art thou? Petr. One that am summon'd from the power above To guard the innocence of that fair Queen Not more against the man that would accuse her Then all the world besides. Th' art welcome too. Velas. You come too late friend, I am he alone Stand ready to defend that gracious beauty. You may return. Petr. Ther's not a man alive Hath interest in this quarrel but my selfe, I out of mine own knowledg can avouch Her accusation to be meerly false, As hel it selfe. Qu. What mortall man is he, So wilfull in his confidence, can sweare More then he knowes. Petr. I swear but what I know. Alph. Hast thou a name? Petr. Yes, helpe my beaver down, D'ee know me now? Lodovico discovers him Alph. Petruchi! death of manhood, I am plainly bought &amp; sold, why wher's Muretto? Enter Muretto with a sword drawn. Muret. Here as ready to stand in defence of that Miracle of chast women, as any man in this presence. Alph. Are all conspir'd against me? what thou too? Now by my fathers ashes, by my life Thou art a villain, a grosse rank'rous villain, Did'st not thou only first inforce my thoughts to jealousy? Muret. 'Tis true I did. Alph. Nay more, Didst not thou feed those thoughts with fresh supplies Nam'd every circumstance? Muret. All this I grant. Alph. Dost grant it, Dog, slave, Helhound? Muret. Will you hear me? Coll. Heare him good my Lord, let us perswade ye, Alph. What canst thou say Impostor? speake and choake. Muret. I have not deserv'd this my Lord, and you shall find it, 'tis true, I must confesse, that I was the only instrument to incense you to this distemperature and I am prowd to say it, and say it again before this noble presence, that I was my selfe the only man. Alph. Insufferable Devil! Alm. Pray my Lord. Muret. Wonder not my Lords, but lend mee your attentions, I saw with what violence he pursude his resolutions not more in detestation of the Queen in particular, then of all her sex in generall. That I may not weary your patience: I bent all my Studies to devise, which way I might do service to my country, by reclayming the distraction of his discontents. And having felt his disposition in every pulse, I found him most addicted to this pestilence of jealosy with a strong persuasion of which; I from time to time, ever fed him by degrees, till I brought the Queen and the noble Petruchi into the dangers they yet stand in. But with all (and herin I appeale to your Majesties own approbation) I season'd my words with such an intermixing the praises of the Queens bewty, that from jealosy I drew the King into a serious examination of her perfections. Alph. Thus farr I must acknowledg, he speaks truth. Muret. At length having found him indeed surely affected, I perceav'd, that nothing but the suppos'd blemish of her dishonour, could work a second divorce between them. Alph. True, truly fates own truth. Muret. Now my Lords, to cleer that imputation, I knew how easie it would be, by the apparent certainty it selfe, In all which, if I have erred, it is the error of a loyall service. Only I must ever acknowledg how justly I have deserved a punishment, in drawing so vertuous a princesses honor into publick question; and humbly referr my selfe to her gracious clemency, and your noble constructions. Alph. But can, can this be so? Muret. Let me ever else, be the subject of your rage, in the sufferance of any torture. Alph. And is shee chast Petruchi? Petr. Chast by vertue, As is the new born virgin, for ought I know. Muret. I ever whisperd so much in your ears my Lord, and told you, that it was impossible such singular endowments by nature, should yeild to the corruption so much, as of an unworthy thought. Did I not tell you so from time to time, Alph. Lay by your arms, my lords, and joyn with me. Let's kneel to this (what shall I call her?) Woman? No, she's an Angel. Glory of Creation, All kneel. Can you forget my wickedness? Your Peers, Your Senators, your bravest men, make suit on my behalf. Why speak ye not, my lords? I am I know too vile to be remitted, But she is merciful. All. Great Soveraign Lady— Qu. Be not so low, my lord, in your own thoughts: You are, as you were, Soveraign of my heart; And I must kneel to you. Alph. But will you love me? Qu. 'Tis my part to ask that: will you love me? Alph. Ever, yours ever; let this kiss new marry us. What say? Qu. It does; and heaven it self can tell I never did, nor will wrong our first loves. Alph. Speak it no more. Let's rise, now I am King Of two rich Kingdoms, as the world affords: The Kingdom of thy beauty, and this land. But what rests for Muretto? Qu. I account my worthiest thanks his debt. Alm. And he deserves all honor, all respect. Col. Thus my imbraces Can witness how I truly am his friend. Velas. And I whilst I have life. Lodov. Nay when I am dead I, will appear again, clap thee on the shoulder and cry, God a' mercy old Suresby. Petr. I must ask pardon of him, still I thought His plot had aim'd all at his own behoof, But I am sorry for that misconceit. Muret. My lords, What I have been heretofore, I cannot altogether excuse; but I am sure my desires were alwaies honest, however my low fortune kept me down: But now I finde 'tis your honest man is your honest man still, howere the world go. Alph. Muretto, Whilst I live thou shalt be neer me, As thou deservest: And noble Gentlemen I am in all your debts: henceforth beleeve me, I'll strive to be a servant to the State. All. Long live happy both. Alph. But where are now my brace of new-made Courtiers, My Scholler and my Captain? Lodov. I cry guilty, there is a large story depends upon their exploits, my Lord; for both they thinking in such perilous times to be shifting every man for one, have took a passing provident course to live without help hereafter. The man in the moon, Signior Pynto, for the raising of his fortune a Planet higher, is by this time married to a kinde of loose-bodied widow, called by Sirname a Bawde; one that if he follow wholesom instructions, will maintain him, there's no question on't, the captain for his part, is somwhat more delicately resolv'd for as adventurous (though not as frail) a piece of service. For he in hope to marry this lady, attending on the Queen, granted Petruchi his liberty, and by this time hath received a sufficient quietus est. Alph. Are these my trusty servants? What a blindness was I led into! Lodov. If your Highnesses both will in these daies of mirth crown the Comedy; first let me from the Queens royal gift be bold to receive Herophil for my wife; She and I are resolv'd of the business already. Qu. With all my heart, I think her well bestow'd, If she her self consents. Her. My duty, Madam, Shall ever speak my thankfulness, in this I reckon all my services rewarded. Velas. Much comfort to you friend. All. All joy and peace. Lodov. My duty to my Soveraigns, to all therest at once, my heartiest heartiest thanks. Now, lady, you are mine; why so, here's short work to begin with. If in the end we make long work, and beget a race of mad-caps, we shall but do as our fathers and mothers did, and they must be cared for. Enter Pynto, Bufo, Mopas with a tire upon his head, and Shaparoon: Pyn. Follow me not bawde; my lord the King; My Jove, justice, justice. Buf. Justice to me, I was like to have been married to these black muschatoes insteed of that lady. Pyn. I to this ugly bawde. Both. Justice. Alph. Hence you ridiculous fools, I banish you For ever from my presence: Sirrah, to thee I give the charge, that they be forthwith stript, And put into such rags they came to Court in; And so turn'd off. Pyn. Dost hear me King? Buf. King hear me, I'me the wiser man. Alph. No more I say. Mop. Come away, come away for shame; you see what 'tis to be given to the flesh: the itch of letchery must be cured with the whip of correction. Away, away. Exeunt Bufo, Pynto, Mopas and Shaparoon. Alph. What else remains But to conclude this day in Hymen's Feasts? Enter Salassa her hair loose, a white rod in her hand, two or three with bags of money. To whom; for what; Your meaning, name, and errand? Salas. At those feet Lay down those sums of gold, the price of guilt, Of shame, of horror. Qu. What new riddle's this? Muretto whispers the King, Collumello the Queen. Muret. My Gratious lord. Col. I shall inform your Highness. Velas. Woman of impudence. Salas. Your looks proclaim My sentence banishment, or if you think The word of banishment too hard to utter. But turn away, my lord, and without accent I'll understand my doom, I'll take my leave, And like a penitentiary walk Many miles hence to a religious shrine Of some chast sainted Nun, and wash my fin off In tears of penance, to my last of breath. Velas. You come to new torment me. Salas. I am gone, my lord; I go for ever. Going out. Lodov. Faith be merciful, the woman will prove a wife worth the having, I'll Pass my word. Alph. E'ne so; stay, lady, I command you, stay. Velasco here's occasion proffer'd now For me to purchase some deserving favour From woman; honour me in my first suit; Remit and love that lady. Velas. Good my lord. Alph. Nay, nay, I must not be deny'd, my Queen Shall joyn with me to mediate for her. Qu. Yes, I dare undertake, she that presents Her pennance in such sorrow, hearty sorrow, Will know how to redeem the time with duty, With love, obedience. Lodov. D'ee hear, my lord; all the ladies in Arragon, and my wife among the rest, will bait ye like so many wild cats, if you should triumph over a poor yeelding creature, that does in a manner lye down to ye of her own accord. Come, I know you love her with all the very vaines of your heart. Muret. There's more hope of one woman reclaim'd (my lord) then of many conceited of their own innocence, which indeed they never have but in conceit. Velas. To strive against the ordinance of fate, I finde is all in vain: Lady, your hand, I must confess I love you, and I hope Our faults shall be redeem'd in being henceforth True votaries to vertue, and the faith Our mutual vows shal to each other ow. Say, are you mine, resolv'd? Lodov. Why that's well said. Salas. Yours, as you please to have me. Velas. Here then ends All memory of any former strife: He hath enough who hath a vertuous wife. All. Long joy to both. Alph. The money we return Where it is due; and for Velasco's merits Will double it. Thus after storms a calm Is ever welcomest: Now we have past The worst, and all I hope is well at last Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
