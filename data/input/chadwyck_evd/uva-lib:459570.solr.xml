      <field name="fulltext">THE PRISONERS. A TragÃ¦-Comedy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS MOST HONOVR'D VNCLE Mr. Thomas Killegrevv, on his two excellent Playes, the PRISONERS and CLARACILLA. When, worthy sir, I reade your Playes, and finde, Iudgement and Wit, in one strict knot combin'de; How unconstrain'd Both meete to make things rare, And fit without th'expence of Paines or Care; How ev'ry Scene is manag'd, how each Line Doth with a quicke, yet gentle clearenesse shine; How every Passion's rais'd by just degrees, And every humor pend to the life: yet These So truely all your owne, as nothing there Stands lame, or forc'd, either to th'Eye, or Eare; Nor yet enrich'd by others cost, or paine, But like Minerva, rais'd from your owne Braine; I cannot choose but wonder how your Parts Gain'd this perfection without Bookes, or Arts; And I may thence conclude, that soules are sent Knowing from heaven, Learn'd too and Eloquent From their owne Powers within, or safely tell That all Invention's but Remembring well, But why in vaine doe I urge this, when You Have gain'd those helps which learned men ne're knew, And greater too than Theirs? your thoughts have reade Men that are living Rules, whiles bookes are dead; Y'have liv'd in Court, where wit and language flow, Where Iudgements thrive, and where true m?ners grow; Where great and good are seene in their first springs, The breasts of Princes, and the minds of Kings: Where beauty shines cloath'd in her brightest rayes, To gaine all loves, all wonder, and all sipraise: From whence you taught Melintus fires to move, Pausanes too the Eloquence of Love; What others thus to ruder precepts owe. You by Examples, and best patternes know, And teach us that a true and Native grace (In spight of studied Rules and Arts) takes place. When he who more precisly pennes, and drawes His labour'd Scenes true by Dramatique Lawes, May well transcribe those Rules perhaps, but then The Whole runnes lame and rudely from his pen: Bearing those tracts apparent to the view, As shew the grosser lines by which he drew: The thing it selfe thus Vex'd and his Braine too, He gaines but This, To erre with much adoe. Thus want of Nature betrayes Art, whiles he That writes like You that is secure, and Free, Makes flights so undiscern'd so still his owne, That those of towring Eagles are lesse knowne. What though no verse, your Scenes and Acts divides Numbers are Shackles to Great Wits, not Guides, He that Scans ev'ry word, and so Confines To Certaine Measur'd feete his well-pac'd lines Enslaves the Matter, which he should Expresse And false to's Art, makes the Thing Serve its Dresse, But you on purpose have these Rules declin'd, Not trusting those which Others Wits design'd, Hence looke we on you, as on those whose worth Vnborrow'd first gave Sciences their Birth, Men full of Native frame, like Patterne, showne, And following no example, but their owne, When you invent, you'r Free when Iudge, youre Cleare Yet so that larger thoughts did never beare True judgement off, nor judgements Rule suppesse, Or draw downe thoughts from generous Mightinesse: Nor can we strictly this invention call, Or Iudgement that Both mixe, Both shew in all: Thus, like two Ã¦mulous flames, they twist at last In one bright Pyramide, whose lustres cast Such undivided glories, that they raise, A solemne Trophie unto eithers Praise. H. Benet</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO MY HONOVR'D FRIEND Mr. Thomas Killigrew, On these his Playes, the PRISONERS and CLARACILLA. Worthy Sir, Manners, and Men, transcrib'd; Customes express'd, The Rules, and Lawes Dramatique not transgress'd; The Points of Place, and Time, observ'd, and hit; The Words to Things, and Things to Persons fit; The Persons constant to Themselves throughout; The Machin turning free, not forc'd about; As Wheeles by Wheeles, part mov'd, and urg'd by part; And choyce Materials workt with choycer Art; Those, though at last begg'd from long sweate &amp; toyle, Fruits of the Forge, the Anvil, and the File, Snatch reverence from our Iudgements: and we doe Admire those Raptures with new Raptures too. But you, whose thoughts are Extasies; who know No other Mold, but that you'le cast it so; Who in an even web rich fancies twist, Your selfe th'Apollo, to your selfe the Priest; Whose first unvext conceptions do come forth, Like Flowers with Kings Names, stampt with Native worth; By Art unpurchas'd make the same things thought Far greater when begot, than when they're Taught. So the Ingenuous fountaine clearer flowes And yet no food besides its owne spring knowes. Others great gathering wits there are who like Rude Scholers, steale this posture from Van Dike That Hand, or eye from Titian, and doe than Draw that a blemish was design'd a Man; (As that which goes-in Spoyle and Theft, we see For th'most part comes out Impropriety) But here no small stolne parcells slily lurke, Nor are your Tablets such Mosaique worke, The web, and woofe are both your owne, the peece One, and no fayling for the Art, or fleece, All's from your Selfe, unchalleng'd All, All so, That breathing Spices doe not freer flow. No Thrifty spare, or Manage of dispence, But things hurld out with Gracefull Negligence, A Generous Carriage of unwrested Wit; Expressions, like your Manners freely fit: No Lines, that wracke the Reader with such guesse, That some interpret Oracles with lesse. Your Writings are all Christall, such as doe Please Critickes palates without Critickes too: You have not what diverts some Men from sense, Those two Mysterious things, Greeke and Pretence: And happily you vvant those shadovves, vvhere Their Absence makes your Graces seeme more cleare. Nor are you he, vvhose vovv vveares out a Quill In vvriting to the Stage, and then sits still; Or, as the Elephant breeds. (once in ten yeares, And those ten yeares but once) vvith labour beares A sÃ¦cular play. But you goe on and show Your veine is Rich, and full, and can still flow; That this doth open, not exhaust your store. And you can give yet two, and yet two more, Those great eruptions of your beames doe say, When others Sunnes are set, you'le have a Day. And if Mens approbations be not Lot, And my prophetiquet Bayes seduce me not; Whiles he, who straines for swelling scenes, lyes dead Or onely prays'd, you shall live prays'd, and read. Thus, trusting to your selfe, you Raigne; and doe Prescribe to others, because none to you. Will Cartwright.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Enter King, Sortanes, Eumenes, and Cleon. King. Are the Gallies come from Rhodes? Em. Yes Sir, they ariv'd this evening King. Then we're all in readinesse, and if the gods Smile upon us, those proud sisters shall finde They have puld downe fire by playing with my anger, Pretend a vow to peace, and staine their bond by it, Not to arme but in their owne defence, Come, twas trecherous and since in our greatest danger They could leave our friendship to that sudden ruine That threatned us, they shall find now our vertues Have wrought through, what enemies we can be Whose friendship they have despised: and into their Bosomes Ile throw all the miseries of warre, Whose single name was such a terrour to em, Wheres our sister? Cle. She went this evening in her galley To take the ayre. Ki. When she returnes tell her I must speake with her This night, and doe you heare Eumenes, Let all things be in readinesse to put to sea, With the morning tide, the winde stands faire still. Eu. Yes Sir, the windes faire. Ki. What said the Captaine of the Gally that you tooke, Had they notice of our intent? Eu. Yes sir, he sayes they had intelligence, But they are so unprepared for war, that the Knowledge was no advantage, they received it As men stabd in their sleepe, that wake onely To finde their dangers certaine. Ki. Their falshoods have begot their feares, and now Like cowards they fall upon their owne swords, Eumenes, let the slaves be well fed to night. Exit. Scena Secunda. Enter Cecillia, Philon, Eugene, and three Souldiers being chased a-shore by Pyrats. Phi. Fly, Madam, save your selfe while we With our faiths, make a stop, for know Philon will lay his body a willing sacrifice To intercept your danger. Cecil. Oh Philon, which way shall we take? I know Not where we are, why did you land here? He durst not have pursued us to the harbour, My brothers fleete now in readinesse to depart Would have protected us. Eu. This way the slave ran that went to call for aide. A noise within, Follow, follow, Phi. Harke Madam, we're pursude, Tis now no time to talke, upon my life It is Gillippus, and the bold Pirate I feare knovves The value of the prize he hunts. Within, Follow, follow, Ceci. They come, take some other way and try If you can divert their chase, whilst we Take Covert in this wood. Exeunt Enter Philon and his party, beaten in by Gillipus, Hiparcus, and Souldiers of their part. Gil. Follow mates, for we have in chace The wealth of Kingdomes, one whose maiden Mine The gods would digge it, nor has her Virgin earth Beene wounded yet for that precious metall, But keepes her, Indies still unconquer'd: If we gaine her weele saile no more, nor steere Vncertaine fates by a fix'd starre, nor pray For faith, that we may hope a safety in the midst Of the dangerous wonders of the deepe. Hip. Slip not this opportunity, we know not how long Fortune will court us, which path tooke she? Gil. I know not, let us divide our selves. Ile take this Exit. Gil. Enter Pausanes and meetes Hiparcus. Pau. Hyparcus what glorious things were those That fled us as if we durst hurt them? Hy. Hansome women, man. Pau. Were they but women? Pau. stands with his eyes fixt upon the ground. Hy. But women, no but women, what aylst thou? Pau. I am sure they are more then man, for I never saw Any of that sex that made me tremble, yet These did, and with a cold feare the memory Dwells in my brest still. Hy. Thunder-strucke by a woman; courage man Blacke eyes tho they lighten, yet they doe not use To shrinke our hearts in the scabberd. Pau. These doe not use to fight, doe they? If they doe, by all our gods theyle conquer me. Oh Hiparcus, doe not mocke my misery but tell me Hast thou seene many such; such formes usuall Amongst em? this has Medusa's power in that Beautious forme, &amp; I am changed to weeping Marble. Hy. By this good day hees in love, could I be so How happy might I be, for I have beene, Pretty lucky in the sex, and could I have lov'd All that I have layne with, what a share of Heaven Should I have had, looke how he stands now, Pausanes what dost meane, let fall thy weapon When thou pursuest a wench. Pau. A wench! whats that? I thought of none. Hyp. The greater part, and the hansomest, and that They are not the better part of women, is yet To be disputed. Pau. How canst thou distinguish em? How dost thou know a wench? Hy. Severall wayes, but the best is by feeling em. Pau. But that I know from rocking in the Cradle It still has beene so, how should we two come to be friends? Theres such contrarieties even in our nature, That both looking on one heavenly forme We should from the same subject draw such Different thoughts; whil'st I was Philosophying Vpon her diviner part, and preparing how to worship; Thou wert casting to pollute her. But prethee tell me In thy serious thoughts, were it not better to finde Those beauties that adorne her, the cloathing Of a perfect god, then such a falling Image. Hy. Faith in serious thoughts, which hansome women Ought not to be mingled with, worships God, But to be worshipt better: but prethee Put off this serious discourse now, this is no time to talke When we have the prey in chase. Exit Pau. Fare thee well, but that I know thee stout, Faithfull to thy friend, and one that speakes Worse of himselfe then any other dares, Ide teare thee from my bosome, But when I know This; and how strictly thou wilt pay thy vowes To honour, thou shalt dwell for ever here. Exit Scena Quarta. Enter Gallippus, and Cecillia. Gal. Y'are very faire, let that remove your wonder, Gallippus has surprizd her, and leads her in. How we dare againe gaze upon that excellence, She frownes. Why doe you frowne? is it your Innocence, Or your beauty, that you mistrust, That thus you arme your selfe with anger to Defend you, pray leave to be an enemy, you see That could not protect you. Cecil. No monster, tis not to see thee play thy part That troubles me, but to thinke that heaven Failes in hers, thus to leave vertue without a guard, Whilst lust and rapine grow strong in mischiefe, As if the Innocent were created white Onely to be fit to take the murtherers purple. Gal. As ye have mercy, remoove that threatened danger, That ruine in your curld brovv, and injustice Which your anger cannot know; weigh my action And crosse fate together, then call to minde How severely I was punisht for a single fault, A fault that my love pleaded for but did not excuse: And when you have found that blot in my story, If you are equall, you must confesse all my life To that houre paid you an humble and a faithfull Service, and had I not found your scorne Would leave me to my Dispaires, I had Waited my fortunes, and not by force Attempted to have gain'd my wishes, had you Not bowed me that way, but tryed what I could have suffer'd for you, not from you, 'Twould have started your soft soule to have Seene me suffer, that would through a thousand Hazzards have courted your favour till I Had falne your Martyr. Cecil. Away, thy oylie tongue, nor bloody hand cannot prevaile, Thy flattery and thy force, I am above both, For love and his soft fire thou never feltst it, Nor knowst that God, but by the name, Thy false stoopings conclude thou canst not worship, That thus durst againe by force attempt me, That heart that truely loves, nobly suffers: and Knowes that God of passions is to the longing soule, Both the hunger and the food, and if his heaven Be not reach'd with knees, their hands are not, Nay cannot, yet maist thou live to love, and me, I wish it not to glory in, but to punish thee. Gil. Are you so resolv'd, then Ile kneele no more, But frowning gather all thy sweetes, begging Lovers teach women a way to deny, which else They durst not know: A slave thereâ Enter a slave, and Hipparchus. Take to your charge, this faire folly, and As your eyes looke to her, let not her face Bindes her Betray your faith; convey her to the Gally, There my Empire will begin. Cer. Think'st thou thy threates can fright, no I cannot So much doubt the care of heaven, to think that power Whose providence considers the fall of every little bird, Will sleepe now, and o'resee the ruine of a Kingdome: No monster I defie thee. Gil. Away to the Gally, there When we have got the bootie Ile meete you. Exit. Hip. Tis a lovely forme, with what a scorne She beares her fortune.! Cecil. Sir I am but a stranger to you, yet if you Durst disobey this bad man and give me freedome I will not say I can reward such a benefit, But I am certaine I can be gratefull: Can you doe it? Hip. If I durst be dishonest Madam I think I could. Cecil. Dishonest? if it were not mine owne cause I would dispute the act; but since 'tis, Ile urge no more, for know I can with lesse Paine be a prisoner then twice beg my freedome: Obey him Sir. They meet Pausanes. Hip. With paine and blushes, Madam I shall. Pau. Ha! tis she, and bound. Hiparcus whether dost thou hale that innocence. Hip. Our Captaine deliverd her to me with command To carry her to the Gally. Pau. Hold Hiparchus; At what price hast thou accepted this Vnbecomming office? tis not like thy selfe: The brave hunter doates not upon the quarrie, Nor had Hiparcus wont to fight for spoile. Hip. Nor does he now, nor ever shall So faultie a conquest hang upon my name, As to make me blush the victorie. She was deliverd me by our Captaine, And she can witnesse that to my faith he left The securing her to the Gally. And Pausanes knowes Hiparcus dares not breake A trust. Pau. Thou mistakest this service, for to doe This act is breaking trust with heaven. Thou break'st with the gods, thou breakst with him That gave thee credit for thy courage, and Thine honour, and sent thee forth their souldier To fight for them, and this the day of battaile, Here the vertue on whose side thou ought'st To bleede, the innocent in whose cause they Command thee die to live a Conqueror. Now thou flyest, thou runnest away, Hiparcus flies meanly unvanquish'd, As if by a pannick feare terrour-strucke, For he is beaten by a mistake and conquers His enemy while he loses his fame at home. Hip. Hold, what meanes Pausanes thus With injurious words to wound his friend? Pau. I injure thee? I wound Hiparcus? I Throw a scandall upon my friend? yee gods Strangely punish Pausanes when he does so. Hip. What doe you lesse when you upbraid me for My faith, and with art of words labour To make me appeare faultie, as if you Did not know the law by which we are bound Is not alike with free men: We are his slaves; and for our loyaltie Have beene rewarded with these priviledges Above our fellowes, woul'st have me kill The cause of his bountie and in justice For my treachery become a slave, and Make this which was my fate my punishment, I tell thee Pausanes I could not Be free here should I doe this act. He layes his hand upon his breast. Cecil. Defend me yee powers from this youth, his honour Brings greater dangers then the Traytors bonds: Sir, pray plead no more for me. Hipar. offers to goe. Pau. Hiparchus thou see'st now tamely I have pleaded, And in calmenesse urg'd my reasons: Once againe By our wounds and blood so oft together shed That their mixtures, have in their fall begot A kinde of kindred, by all our miseries Which still have beene allied, by our friendship I conjure thee give me her freedome. Hip. I see thou hat'st me, else my reasons would Prevaile, and thou would'st leave to preferre A prisoner before thy friend, and his faith given: And therefore know though your friendship doe plead When tis against mine honour I can be deafe. Pau. Thou canst be anything, and I can weepe To finde it, yee gods, would I have us'd Hiparcus thus, Oh heavens that ever I Should call thee friend: Hiparcus stay, I have Hip. offers to goe agen. One argument left still; unbinde her Or guard you. Hip. Pausanes. Pau. Your Sword. Hip. Heare me speake. Pau. No words, her freedome or your sword. Hip. Pausanes knowes I will not be beaten Into an opinion, and since thou hast drawne Thy sword last I will not yeeld her: My honour Forbids me, thou art injurious to thinke Thy force can prevaile beyond thy reason, I tell thee Pausanes thy anger should not start me If I could make thee an enemy. Pau. Defend your selfe. They fight and are both wounded. Hip. Will you yet give me leaveâto be faithfull. Pau. No, Hiparcus hunts his will not his faith. Here Hiparcus gets Pausanes downe. Cecil. As you have honour hold, and let a virgins Teares that shall fall to Seas divide your anger But till my prayers can confirme your friendship. They struggle. Pau. Looke upon her teares and these wounds whose Anguish thy friendship not thy Sword brings and Then weigh the act, I would thou hadst beene Ten enemies rather then one friend To have disputed this cause. Hiparchus disarmes him. Scena Quinta. Enter Gillippus, Zenon and Souldiers. Gill. Make all possible speede aboard with the bootie, They pursue us close. Command Hiparcus And Pausanes ashore to guard us. Hah! What meanes this, what makes she ashore? Pau. That which thou canst not make aboard; she has made An honest man, and if thou darst make another, She may have two friends. Gill. Hiparcus resolve this riddle. Hip. This woman whom you gave to my trust Pausanes would have releas'd, and when His arguments as friends could not prevaile, Meanly he threw off his Faith, and by force Attempted to take her from me. Gill. Slave, did I for this preferre thee, When at the sacke of Tunis thou becam'st My slave, and by thy owne confession wert A thing without a name, and could'st neither From men nor country clayme a being? now Thy treachery shall make thee as darke an exit As thy base soule had entrance. Pau. I scorne thy threates from this death I shall Begin to live, till now I lay wrapt in rust, And the Canker fed upon my fame from this act I shall adopt a name which till this minute I despair'd of: since that fatall day In which old Perseus fell, in whom onely liv'd That knowledge we so hunt for; And Hiparcus If thou continuest thou'lt be asham'd to finde. For the bounties thou urgest what were they But making us a better kinde of slaves, commanded Commanders impaling our free soules So that we could employ but one vertue, Our courage since we serv'd thee; and that Has throwne us into dangers, honour would be Asham'd to owne, and brought wounds that leave Blushing scarres, this when Hiparcus has Let fall his passion, will make him tremble To finde he could not feare but bleede For a Traytor, And strucke against a virgins honour. And Pau. turnes to Cecillia. In his rage sould his friend to buy his will: Then, then Hiparchus those wounds thou now art proud of Will hang upon thee with more dishonor Then thy Chaines, For me I smile at this chance, For though I have mist my first freedome, et I have found my last wounds. Hip. Ha! Gil. Villaine, hast thou not yet enough layd up Thy treacherous soule, art not satisfied To be false thyselfe that thus thou labour'st To shake his try'd faith: Hiparcus kill him Kill ee'n his memory that the ingratefull slave May fall like a dogge and leave no name behind him The slaves offer to kill him. Yet hold, he shall not die so nobly, nor finde Such mercy in his fall. Hiparcus strip the slave And upon a tree stretch the Traytors body, There let him hang alive, like the condemn'd Fruit to the fruitlesse tree, damn'd thither To live a death; and would count that murder That threw 'em their mercy if it would come. And breake the snare. Cecill. Bloody villaine! Darst thou command this with a beleefe Thou shouldst be obeyd, what is he that has So much hell about him that dares execute What thy bloody rage imposes. Pau. Gentle soule plead not for Pausanes, nor Grudge him this glorious end, for now I fall What I could not have liv'd with him; Honors servant. Gill. Away with him and see it done, or by The gods he pulls his fate downe that disputes it. The slaves seize him. Hip. He that trembles at death, let him dye Tis just, hold Sir, witnesse my wounds I dare Be loyall, and when my faith was given Through the streights of friendship sworne to serve you, Yet tho I did this because my faith Was given, and honor told me I was in The right, yet doe not thinke I will be So faultie to my friend as to start at Thy frowne more then his Sword, or be frighted To the murder of my brother. Gil. Ha! whats this? Hip. No Gallippus I have no such Aguie courage, Nor comes mine honour so by fits; know though I durst not breake a trust, yet I dare disobey Your impious commands, nor can you call It treachery when to your face I disavow It, frowne not, for while I have mine old guide Honor, there is no act brings so darke a hazard But Hiparchus will strike a fire from it Shall light him through. Gal. My rage, whither wilt thou hurle me? Draw mates. Gall. Zenon and the Slaves draw. Villaines though my anger hath lost her tongue Yet her hands are left still: And those in wounds Shall print on you wretched bodies my revenge. Hip. There, defend thy selfe. Feare not Madam, Hip. returnes Paus. sword and they two defend themselves. These are our enemies. Paus. Now I have my wish. Gall. At this rate take it. Here Paus. steps to Cecil. and unbinds her, Gall. in the interim wounds him, but he releases her before he defend himselfe. Pau. Think'st thou I would not buy her freedome when my blood Could purchase it, have I lived as if I fear'd wounds? Thou canst scarce be mine enemy after this favour, O that I could kisse it! thou should'st kill me E're I would take my lippes from it. Cecil. To what fate am I reserv'd, Helpe, Rape, Murder, Murder. Exit. Enter the King and Souldiers; they beate off Gillippus and Zenon, and tooke Hip. and Paus. Binde those and pursue the rest. Sister well met, Along with me. Exit.</field>

I tell thee Cecillia, if they could have helpt To have borne thee hence thou should'st have seene Lust and pride flow really in 'em. Their feare My sister made 'em fawne, Away to the Oares with 'em. Hip. Had we scap'd misfortunes till we met feares Thy Army King might have found a grave E're they had seene us bound: And to let thee see We have no shaking soules, this threatned misery Shall not make us or feare or fawne on thee. Paus. Peace Hiparcus, let him see us dye e're touch an Oare. Twill resolve him what we dare. Cecil. Has my brother lost all his nature, then I shall not wonder that I have lost the interest Of a sister. Can you be a King, and have Neither mercy nor justice? Farewell, hence forth I may obey but n'ere approve the Act. They offer to lead Hip. and Paus. off. Hold Sertanes, looke upon their wounds, yee Gods! Ought any thing that chance ownes make men fall So low, that we should esteeme 'em lesse then Beasts, see they bleed still, canst thou leave 'em Like dogges to licke those wounds, whose every drop Of blood I can witnesse, fell a sacrifice To honour, oh! tis a fault, a fault I feare The gods will punish; as if men in misery Had no soules, or slaves did not upwards looke. Ki. Hold Sortanes, unbinde em, they are your Prisoners Now; and as you please dispose of em. Thinke not my nature cruell, or that I Fround upon them, for Kings doe often so Vpon the fault when they pitty the man, Yet if I get the head of this Serpent, he Shall finde our Iustice with its full weight, But weele crush him. Cecil. Now I kneele to you sir. Ki. What meanes my sister? rise, my occasions Give me leave onely to say farewell, till My returne Philon, obey my sister As my selfe. Cecil.

That title confirmes my life; for now I finde. My rage did not destroy my selfe, and through Thy wounds let out thy friendship, with joy I live to redeeme thy fault. Pau. Oh Hiparcus this be my witnesse, thy friendship Growes here, nor wert thou faulty, nor doe I Want an argument, thou hadst reason, and I had love Whose power yet thou never felt'st, but when Thou shalt finde he is undisscern'd got in, And in this bosome displayes his fiery wings, Then lite me withall that Light thou'lt finde Thou art in the darke, and thus stoope to the Willing yoke, sighing for what thou wouldst not Part with: these, these Hiparcus are the wounds I feare, those the sword makes are remedies, and If deepe enough, bring a certaine cure Enter Philon.

Noble Gallippus thus to venture your selfe And fortunes in our hazard is an obligation We know not how to pay; for the preparation You speake of, brings our certaine ruine, if By treaty we not appease his fury. Gal. Pray Madam from whence springs his anger? Eu. Tis just: you know the cause of this warre, our Country blest beyond our neighbours, with a Fruitfull peace, drew us into a consideration How we became to be so happy, and In the search, we found ambition Had no dwelling here: For our customes Admit no one man chiefe which kept all from That sinne. For our government is here in The hands of a Priest and Iudge, which are Chosen by lot, not faction, and their power During Life if they obey our lawes. One Of which has begot this danger, for when Our predecessors made their vow to peace; A law was then enacted to prohibit Our taking armes, but in our owne defence. Lucan. This law the King credits not, for when we Return'd it as the reason that forbad us, Yeelding the ayde he then implored, he Sayes we urged it but to hide our trecherie. And concludes we assisted his enemy, Because we refus'd him ayde; and now Having labour'd through that storme, his rage Bends this way. Dion. And at a time when we Have neither Armes nor councell to defend us, Now Madam the punishments your fathers have Cald downe pursue us, their counsell and your Brothers swords, were aides which we shall finde best, When to our despaires we feele the want. Crem. Yet let us not quit our selves, when we must Fall, the deerer we sell our lives the greater Fame will waite us, nor have our men forgot To fight, though we left to invade. Gall. Spoke like a Souldier! How is the Towne fortifyed toward the harbour. Crem. Tis no regular fortification; twill stay a leape. Gall. Madam, I beseech you remove your feares, They are ill Omens, here speake courage, You know not what miracles we may act. The night comes on a pace, pray retire to Your rest while Cremnofield, Dion, and my selfe Goe set the watch and provide for the receite Of these strangers that come thus rudely Without inviting. Eucr. Wee'le goe and joyne our strength of prayer With your armes which I hope will protect us. They faile to conquer them. Exit. Gall.

Exit all but Gall. Gall. Farewell shallow fooles, thinke ye Gallippus Will sell his blood for aiery honour, no, Tis revenge or the satisfying some other Lust ingages me. Therefore Ile to my Gally, And while this darke protect us, command Zenon to launch from the harbour. And in A little Creeke lye loose and undiscover'd With his Gally; tis wisdome to secure A Retreate nor will I againe put my Happinesse in the power of slaves whose trechery, Wrack'd my soule and depriv'd me of the pleasures I had promis'd to my selfe, in faire Cecillia. But these have removed that paine, for he That like me loves beauty, where ere he meetes It, sowes his love and when he enjoyes it Reapes his interest. Exit. Scena Tertia. Enter Cecillia and Philon. Cecil. Was the Fleet within sight of land This mornining? Phi. Yes Madam they have hung about the Ile Of?these foure dayes kept backe by Contrary windes. Cecil. When returnes the Gally that came from my brother? Phi This tide he puts off. Cecil. This opportunitie then will advance My designe. Have you fitted those prisoners With a disguise? Phi. Yes Madam. Cecil. Harke whats that? a Lute! are they musicall? Phi. Yes Madam one of 'em playes and sings. A Song. Fond Pausanes let not thy love aspire To hope of comming higher, But let thy faith grow up under a cloud Of being not alow'd And still persue thy love till she like well To know it but thou not tell, Next thy care must be she not perceive Thou beleev'st she has given leave, Thy love and sufferings thus being humbly told And not a sigh too bold: Nor with a looke speake or let a feare be proud To be discern'd least thou love too loud. Whilst fairely thus thou do'st thy love pursue Pretending nothing due, In time her heart may grow to wish thee well Whether she will or no, By such soft steps as these and slow degrees, And ever on his knees, Pausanes still shall approach his blisse, But not come neare enough to misse; But at a distance looke and love And see her farre above, Yet not wish her descending to my sense, Or hope of meeting but my influence. Cecil. Call him hither. Exit Philon. Now Cecillia arme thy selfe With resolution, that thy sex may not Still be cald weake; nor thou yeeld to thy passion, Lest this god in a cloud deceive thee, and Force thee with his yeeldings, he sings his actions, And acts his opinions, which makes him A dangerous friend; hee's one that boldly dares, Yet humbly loves; he strucke his master, yet Bow'd to me, and when his rage had fild His eyes with fire, he sighing turn'd, and looking This way in languishing streames quencht Their rising flames. O power of honour! that Makes this so in him: And honour me! not To returne his love, it starts me! To finde Honour pleasd still to confound our reason, And puts us to our acts of faith; but see They come, their hands wove in friendship. Enter Hiparchus, and Pausanes, and Philon, File common Souldiers. Paus. Doe thou speake while I collect my selfe; Yet doe not; why should I refuse By my disorder to speak her power, If she deserve my love, I'me certaine shee'le Command my feare. Nor is it a dishonour To shake here, tis not I tell Hiparcus Tis not, these are valiant feares, and Ile speake to her in what my heart thrust out, For by my life, all that I have resolv'd of, I have quite forgot. Hip. But doe not rashly tempt her to a scorne. Scorne? O no Hiparchus, if e're her softnesse Hath felt loves power, she knowes his Proper language is free prose. And their Distractions wrap the powerfull'st truth Bondage, verse tells us they are too much themselves, Nor is he affected that can compose His sufferings: See where she stands. They kneele. Cecil. Rise, your freedome is the bounty of another And the thankes not due to me, I sent for you To tell you my brother is now upon A designe for Sardinia, but has beene staid By crosse winds so that you may overtake Him (ere he lands) in a Gally, which this morning Is bound for him, and in this disguise By striking on his partie unknowne pay His bounty. Hip. Arme us Madam, and you shall heare How deepe I'le plow, how thicke I'le sow their wounds But I'le reape the honour; my mistake has Lost me in striking against your vertue: And now we are friends Pausanes and Hiparcus Vndivided draw, I thinke we shall not Easily be o'recome, for give me leave To say we are not often conquered But by our selves: And then though Pausanes be victor, Hipercus triumphes. Pau. We can be gratefull Madam, though not fortunate. Cecil. That's my Q. pray let me be thankfull toe, Lest you thinke I can onely councell it: Within this Cabinet I beleeve is in value She fetches a Cabinet and offers it to Hipercus. As much as my person would have yeelded At a Mart, if it be lesse Tis the modest opinion I ought to have Of mine owne worth makes me faultie In the summe, for any other consideration Take this too. She gives a Choice. Hip. Tis just Madam that you throw this scorne On me, for I confesse the fault lookt as If I had fought for money: which opinion My refusall now I hope will remove. Cecil. Pray take it; Why should you receive wounds for me? Hip. I doe not let my selfe out to dangers, Nor is it my trade to fight: wounds and blood Are neither my daily labour nor the Sweat of my brow; They are honours and pay Themselves: If I have courage, tis a gift The gods sent me freely, and as their blessing Freely I'le dispence it. Cecil. Your pardon Sir. I meant no injurious Vpbraiding, for by my life I doe not thinke You faultie: if you will not be Rewarded, yet give me leave to supply your wants. Hip. I kisse your Charitie. Cecil. What to give him I know not, oh unequall Law that bindes us women, and forces me to let Him perish, because I know how to save him! I must not stay, I know y'are friends and what The one has is but the others store, I wish yee may be fortunate My last words, e're I knew what you were Pau. O stay! unbind me ere you goe: And heare My soule labour'd with admiration Of your beauties, but since I was blest With knowledge of your diviner part, all Your acts from honour sprung have collected Those sparkes your eyes kindled and th'are Blowne to a flame here, here it burnes And thougu this Altar (divinest) be built Vpon the meanest earth, scorne it not, for My offering shall be of the purest love, And my sighes shall constant incense breath. Cecil. What thou might'st have done I know not, But I'm sure thou canst not now, thou hast sayd Too much: Go fight, fight, for thou know'st not how To love. Oh woman, woman, woman still! Speakes aside. Pau. Not love? What stranger then is this that's got In here and wanders so to seeke; not love? Tis he or Cowardise crept in, no third cause Can beget the feares the tremblings, I Labour with; Oh! teach me how to know him. Cecil. That stranger when thou meet'st him at the eye Thou wilt finde he is conceiv'd in fire and in And instant growes to perfect forme! Thence in fulnesse of time, he takes his birth Into the heart which is his world, and there. If he prove a healthy love, he lives In silence, the tongue has no pure 'ith birth Of gallant loves, nor are they long lov'd That make their Exits that way, the true birthes Of love know no delivery. But where they tooke Their life through the eye, this is love: thine A short liv'd passion, I feare. (I feare) spoke aside. Pau. My passions are no faults Madam, when I master 'em, when we doe not serve them We command admiration, or should I yeeld To 'em, could any passion be unbecomming That has so beautifull a cause as the Faire Cecillia, who I feare has beene Vs'd to such Hecatombs of hearts, that My single one being but a slaves might well Be scorned at your shrine, yet if you be That power that my thoughts have worshipt, Ye must confesse he that offers all, though A begger, sacrifices equall to a King. O turne not from me, but be like those Gods She turnes away. You bow to, which though they give and guard Our flockes, yet accept a Lambe. Cecil. Plead no more, if thou lov'st thou wilt preferre me, Aside. I must not, dare not understand, I am too much A party to heare him pleade. Pau. O doe not shew the severall wayes you have To wound: May the fire for ever Inhabite in those eyes, but doe not in frownes Dart it this way. Cecil. Be gon then. And consider what thou suest for. A slave by his passion crowned, and A Princesse by her inthron'd. Pau. Doe but beleeve I love tis all I begge, Strike me heaven, if I have so faultie a wish As to attempt the unshrining such a power Or would live to see your beautie fall From this vast nationall ador'd condition, To make them my petty houshold god, O say! Doe you beleeve I love? Cecil. Yes, yes, I beleeve and feare. Pau. O continue that friendly faith; I'le at a distance kneele, for tis a wealth Here he reverences and kneeles. Ile pray for, fight to keepe, and weepe To part with: and if that way of obtayning That way of keeping, and this sense of losse Ask'd with a whole heart, and with a whole Heart defended, but parted from with a broken one, Can confirme it all joyes. She in passion interrupts him and in disdaine speakes and leaves him. Cecil. Peace, be gone. Cecillia collect thy selfe For thou art lost. O yee gods Would yee had given more, or that I had knowne Lesse of Honour. Pausanes startes againe. Pau. Hyparchus my friend I finde my misery, And conjure thee that if thou outlive us, Steale some of my ashes into her urne, that In our earth being become equall We may become one. Exit. Hip. This is strange, yet tis the best kinde of anger, And the storme is to friend, if I can judge a woman. Exit.</field>

What act of mine during that time were you Concern'd in? Zen. Hast thou forgot the faire Zenonia, Me thinkes the halfe I borrow for my disguise From that name should prompt thy soule To a remembrance of the vowes, the false vowes Thou mad'st her. Eum. False vowes! Zen. Yes boasting her the conquest of thy vanitie When with thy perjur'd breath thou begd'st for that Thou valud'st not meerely to affront my passion Which pursued her with all those truthes of love Thou fainedst, yet never reapt a harvest For all my paines, but this is not the injury That wakes my anger; 'tis thy scorne Not thy love of her ingages me, to thinke It should be in any mans power to scorne What I sacrifice to. Eum. How doe you know I scorne her. Zen. Say thou dost not, say thou wilt returne And pay those vowes of love, by all our Gods I'le kneele to thee, for if thou'lt love againe Although my Rivall, her love shall guard thee, And from henceforth thou shalt be my friend, but If thou proceed thus to triumph in her miseries Whose paines I feele, though she be unsensible Of mine, thou shalt finde though I cannot Intreat her love, yet I can force revenge From her darke caves. What does Pelius see about Eumenes. Eum. That she should take him for a foole or coward That he should hope I would trust a Rivall Or feare an enemy; And now I know the reason of thy hate If thou should'st sweare thou art my friend, I'd toll thee thou lyest, if my enemy; why? I doe not care. Zen. Do'st slight my profer'd friendship, doe yee beleeve This language? They fight. Eum. I understand it, and you Shall finde it by the answer I'le make. Eumenes wounded and falls. Zen. This Ring was hers, and shall witnesse I have Punish'd thy falsehood. Gallippus wounded! Enter Gallippus. Gall. Yes Zenon, but not slaine; and yet the King strook Home, I found 'twas folly to resist his force Vnlesse I could have conquer'd his whole Army, And therefore wisely I preserved my selfe For better dayes: Saw'st thou the Princesse Lucanthe since? Zen. Yes shee's fled towards the west Port. Gall. Pursue her gentle Zenon and if thou find'st her Tell her of my escape, say yee left me Aboard the Gally: And if she be ignorant Of her abode tell her sister Eucratia Is with me, whom negligent of her owne danger Impatiently expects her comming to the Gally, Whether I'le goe and waite your comming. Exit. Zen. Yet I'le goe, but not t'assist thy trechery, Yet I'le bring her if I can, she has an interest In Zenonia, and if I can thus bring Her into dangers, my protection Of her honour shall indeere me to her; And so ingage her my friend to Zenonia, The thoughts of whom my soule will ever labour with. Enter Pausenes and Procles having both hold on Eucratia. Paus. Vnhand her. Pro. Shee's my prisoner, and I will not loose her. Paus. Dar'st thou be a Souldier and speake that falsehood. Proc. I first seiz'd her and I'le keepe her. Paus. Had thine age beene able to have kept Flight with me, thou shouldst have seene me hunt her Through the straights of a thousand wounds, and more Downe all the weeeds that grow about her, yet then, Then this Lawrell protected by her vertue, stood Safe in the midst of all that lightning. And Let me tell thee, the same cause that kept Me from laying rude hands upon her, makes me Spare thee, 'Twas a reverence which in some measure Silver haire commands. Proc. I defie thee and thy naked chin; Talker, this plead for me, nor shalt thou finde A gray coward here; binde her and then wee'le Dispute whose she is. Paus. Binde her? looke upon her and tell me On which part of that divine forme thou darst hang A Chaine? Proc. I'le dispute no more, unhand her shee's my prisoner Or but earth. Pau. Remove from her breast that threatned danger Or by our gods thou art earth. Proc. Think'st thou Procles will quit his aged honors For feare of thee, a boy? proud in his first wounds? Pau. Boy, nay then defend thee. They fight. Eucr. To what fate I am reserv'd I know not; But if I can I'le shunne this. Exit. Eucratia flies, Pausanes disarmes Procles. Paus. Shee's gone, Ther's something whisper'd to me protect her, I'le follow her, there, take thy sword, I will not Throwes him his sword. Rob thy age in thy fall. Exit. Proc. I thanke thee, and may thine Be no lesse fortunate than this has beene; And thou buy thy honors at a chaper rate. Enter Pausanes hanging about Hiparcus necke wounded and fainting. Paus. Had I liv'd to have finish't my revenge On that Traitor Gallippus, and from his bosome torne The knowledge of ourselves, which in a golden relique The Tyrant weares about his necke, and still With threatned losse would awe us to our faith, Then Hiparcus I could have dyed in peace. Hip. Whether did you goe to finde these wounds? Pau. In pursuite of the faire Eucratia, I followed her Through all her miseries, but not with intent To adde to them, but to guard her from The raging lust of the common Souldier, till at length Some of her party met us, and to them I ow'd these wounds. Hip. This disorderly possessing the Towne will ruine us, The wounds we receiv'd since the Conquest are more Then we got ith'attempt, the Cowards feares Have in their despaire strooke deeper wounds Then their courage knew how to deale. Pau. I have lost much blood, prethee bind up my wounds: What are those? Enter Zenon, and Lucanthe. Zen. This way Madam. Luc. O Zenon hast, I know not which I fly to With greater zeale, my sister or my safetie, Is it farre? Zen. If you can passe the port, we are safe, hah! Hip. Stand, the word. Zen. Death! if thou refuse us passage. Lucan. Or a Virgins prayers for ever, if thou dar'st Let my innocence escape this ruine, O speake, death and dishonor pursue us close: O speake Sir. Hiparchus is surpriz'd with Lucanthes beautie, and stands amaz'd. Hip. Passe? Yes faire one, I dare let you passe And through all hazards serve you. O Pausanes, Speakes aside to Pausanes. Live to counsell me, something like thy description I feele here. Zen. Shall we passe or no? Hip. Smooth your brow, your frownes will make no way here. Zenon offers to draw. Zen. My Sword shall then. Hip. No Zenon thou know'st it never could. When Hyparcus denyed thee passage. Zen. Hah! Hiparcus? Hip. Yes Zenon Hiparcus, who to let this Lady see How much he dares in her cause, he will not onely Give her a passage, but with it all his peace Of minde: And doe thou thanke heaven for this Sanctuary. For were it not that thou hast taken hold On that Altar, the murder of Eumenes here I would Have punish'd, but such is the power Of that Deity, that I can differ My hate, nay forgive thee, if shee'le confesse Thy sword or faith hath sacrificed ought To her deliverance. Luc. He has; and he, onely can guide me To hope of safetie; Gentle youth the gods Reward thee; Harke! I'me pursued if thou hast power Within follow, follow, &amp;c. Divert their rage. Hip. Your name, leave but that to call upon in my danger. And then I'le plant my selfe here, an enemy To all that dare pursue your softnesse, O doe not hide It from me, and leave me to bow To a power I know not. Luc. Lucanthe the unfortunate, gentle youth May all thy wishes fall upon thy head: Away Zenon. Exit Lucanthe and Zenon. Pau. Now Hiparcus had I reason once? Hip. Lucanthe? the Princesse Lucanthe is it not? Enter the King. King. Yes Souldier, Lucanthe, the Princesse Lucanthe, Which way went she? Hip. This way she went, but I must beg You'le not pursue her. King. These are the Souldiers I so much admir'd. Is it your ignorance, or doe you wilfully Strike at the reward your daring youth Has this day merited. Hip. If we are faultie tis wilfully, but this act We hope ownes no guilt. King. It is not a fault thus to blot this conquest Whose greatest beauties are gifts of your owne hands? Hip. My soule has vowed, I see it written yonder Not to suffer any one to passe this way While my sword and I can impeach their stay. Pau. And I though weake in body am strong in friendship Pausanes offers to rise but cannot And my friends vowes shall ever be my cause. Hip. You see our resolution Sir, and we dare dye. King. And I dare fight and thus force my passage. The King charges, Hipar. onely defends. Hip. O hold Sir and heare me speake. King. Shall I passe? Hip. Your selfe can witnesse what faith I brought To your cause, my charge usher'd pale death About the field; And when I found him lazie And waiting upon fate, I leapt from his leane side And with my sword dealt more deaths then he. King. Pursue the act: And let me hunt this scornefull Lady till With miseries I have made her wilde heart tame, The conquest will be perfect then. Hip. All's done and fought to conquest: And cowards onely Strike afterwards, A foe that flies Is your slave, and no longer deserves The honord name of enemie. King. Shall I passe? Hip. 'Tis slaughter you pursue, and will staine All those honor'd wounds your conquest gilt, But for this Princesse whose vertue I bow to, O Sir can you be so blinded with your rage As to avow a warre with her. Kin. Leave to Counsell &amp; obey: Mercy and Iustice Are specious shewes, but to obey Is your best sacrifice, which if thou offer'st not By mine anger I'le offer thee. Hip. Obey? yes, the Gods I'le obey, and strike Against all that strike at them; know you command A freeman, one that chose your party, and none Of that number that was borne under you; And I beseech you Sir attempt not your passage Here, for I must not so betray her safetie As to defend our cause weakely. King. Are you so resolute? O Hiparcus dye like thy selfe, thou hast A brave rocke before thee, and in that kingly marble Digge thy grave; O for strength enough to part 'um! (They fight. Enter Eucratia. Euc. This by his habit should be a Commander; Eucratia pursued by the Kings party, layes hold on the Kings sword, and yeelds herself prisoner, who amazed, in passion speakes. To him (since I must feele the misery of bonds) I'le yeeld my selfe, defend me Sir, I am Your prisoner, my name Eucratia. King. Hold your swords, he that adds another stroke To warre, shall feele the weight of this! Hip. Blest chance! Eucratia! are you Eucratia? Euc. Yes and a Prince, till thy ambitious king Hunted me to my ruine. King. O Eucratia! Soule of sweetnesse! That wretched King see prostrate at thy feete, And if thou can'st not pardon, tread upon My necke; And let thy vertues sinke me to a grave Ther's something divine about thee; which in an instant Has from my temples torne the lawrell reward Of my yet bleeding wounds, And from a conquering King Made me all thy slave; Command me something. Enter a Souldier. Soul. Helpe Sir to save the Princesse Lucanthe That's lost, sold to lust and rape If you not redeeme her straight. Euc. Vnfortunate Lucanthe! I foresaw this danger Sad Fate! O my Sister. Hip. Lucanthe, which way went the ravisher? O Sir your pardon! Soul. I saw Gallippus i'th Pluto beare her from shore. Kin. Gallippus? tis false madam remove your feares, My selfe slew him in the Battell. Hip. O Sir he has abus'd you by some wile, for on my life I saw him since your encounter. Soul. Let me dye if this be false. Euc. O Sir, now I claime your offer, and beg, not command, You will compleat your conquest and pursue This Ravisher. King. Souldier thy faith in her cause Has beene already tride, doe thou provide One of the swiftest Gallies for this expedition. Come Madam, wee'le all goe to save this innocent, Helpe this wounded youth aboard, and see he want For no care, such vertue shines not every where. Euc. Sir his courage has obliged me, and he Shall be my care, he found me when I was Falne into the rage of the common people. I kisse your hands Madam, and tis happinesse. Paus. Enough that I have liv'd to serve Such a vertue as is seated In the faire Eucratia. Command a cessation from armes and let all acts Of warre here cease, for the faire Eucratia Now is Conqueror.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus Scena Prima. Enter Cecilla, and Philon, Lissemella in a boyes habit. Cic. Vrge not his condition, I must not so mistrust The Iustice of those powers I bow to, As to feare they would leave me to such a scorne, A common slave; No Philon, if there were not chance In his condition their tongues would have doubled Vnder such a load as love; a slaves heart would Have had too many hungry wants upon it To have found leisure to have beg'd love. Phil. This under favour is no argument And though I feare a want in their blood yet I beleeve they have wit enough and their craft Perhaps tooke hold of some pitty which you shew'd 'um; For (as a friend) Madam your mercies were Even to weakenesse; And but that I feare To displease you, I could say, he but returnes love; This will move: And as my faith and dutie Aside, he kneeles. Thus low bowes, so my honour bids me Defend you, especially when you have So dangerous an enemy as your passion To engage my faith against: Looke but upon Your habit, and examine the nature Of this act, and you shall finde you walke Blinded, to your honours ruine, have you not throwne Off your Sex; and the honour of a Queene And now appeard cloath'd in blushes, and disguis'd With faults, but this were nothing if my feares Were false, which tells me this habite is lyn'd With as faulty resolutions, nor can you Condemne those that know you not, if the conclude You have with your sex throwne off your modestie. Cecil. I'me lost for ever. She lies downe. Phil. No Madam if you stay you are safer, for This attempt, and have found your errour, I confesse to this journey I carry nothing But obedience, had you fled to meete A plighted faith, through darkest hazards I would have waited on you, but when you flye To follow one you know not, a slave too Perhaps flies from you: Nay, grant him a Prince, Can your honours be safe when you pursue? Oh Madam! when you were your selfe and from Your reason collected truth, and upon that rocke Would in arguments give law to love: I have heard Your powerfull reasons conclude, That a Queene is safer that is pursued By a slave, if he keepe the path of love; Then the greatest monarch of the earth could be, Should she pursue a God; And upon My knees I begge you wo'not at this rate Reward the ambition of the wretch. Cicil. Oh Philon Thou art cruelly faithfull And unsensible of my sufferings, thoud'st drinke Ambition: Why say he have but that Gyant fault Yet 'tis a glorious sinne, and without it Not one 'mongst all the Synods of the gods Had fil'd his seate: And twas their feare that made It sinne: In loves religion, tis meritorious Still to aspire a Mistresse, and that love That gives, but will not take no lawes, has cal'd it Gentlenesse, not savage nature, for a servant To leape even at the heart of his Mistresse: But thus much I'le satisfie thy faith By the honour of my mother ashes He woo'd first, and in such words As my resolution onely could deny; And for his nature, how stout, how gentle, How full of honour? judge thou, that wert witnesse Of his acts. Phil. Madam, I see you are resolv'd, and then I know you will not want an Argument; Now I know not whether 'twere a blessing Or no, their protection brought since you Beleeve they love. Cecil. If thou turne away, I'le blush, He lookes away. And tell thee why I beleeve our loves; His friendship could not divide him from me Thou saw'st it made his vertues faultie passions Searching with blushing wounds an enemy In his friends breast. Oh my Cosen, when I thinke on this; I call to minde How for my freedome, he stood as if Hee'd beene immortall, and intending onely to Let the false Gallippus wound his stout breast; Which when he will defend none save the Thunderer Or a friend can hit. Oh Philon, Philon! When I consider these miracles, why should I be So wicked, as to conclude him lesse then a God That acts 'um? And now take thou a secret From me, for I will satisfie thee Even with a faultie act, which may looke Like vanity; turne thy face and heare me: I know my Cozen is full of honour, And I know with all that honour he loves me. This confession I would have dyed e're It should have beene forc't from me; but to conclude thee For it makes thee a partie here, and thy love As unfit to give counsell as mine uncapable To take it: And now I conjure thee Follow and Obey mee, that will Obey my Fate. Nor shall the winds that begin in stormes, Storme. To pleade against me prevaile: I'me resolv'd And this night I'le to Sea, and in her greatest depth Dive to finde that rich pearle, which the wise value Not the lesse, for having a rugged shell. Phil. Oh Madam, to be borne your kinsman was One blessing, but to finde to have a friends place In your thoughts two; And that you know I love, And I not tell it, is a joy beyond All but what your love brings, forgive me and Henceforth I'le obey, not counsell. Your Galley Shall instantly be ready: Thus I have gain'd All my ends in love by having no unworthy one's Vpon her. Exit. Cic. O Love doe thou prosper my intent And a Virgin shall thy Priest become And these great truthes in all thy Temple, seene How in thy infant hand thou grip'st a bow Larger than Ioves; and when thou thy darts lets flye Immortalitie is no guard, but oft they have Through his lightning shot and stroke the thunderer Thy religion's easie, thy law light For thy tables hold but one act, one Commandment, Obey, we cannot misse the way, let none Then say, this youthfull God on cruell is Or blind, sure from disobedience growes All the strayes, crosses, dangers that we finde. Scena Secunda. Enter a Hermit and his Sonne with the body of an old man. Her. Gently sonne lay him downe, bow him forward Storme. More of those waters, he stirrs, so, so, Chafe him still while I dry his snow, which the Sea Could not melt, 'tis he, strange accident! But Ile not be discover'd yet. Sonne. He sighes there's some comfort in that: Her. Sad condition for thy age, when tis a joy To heare thee sigh. Sonne. Good heaven: what does age abroad At this time of his life? Herm, Sure he has wandred farre that has mist A resting place in his evening, and to be pittied When it's forc'd to seeke his Inne thus late At night. Sonne. Sure he was of some religious order By his habite? Herm. No matter for his habit, pull it off And fetch him my gray coate, Dry now is better then rich. Sonne. Which opinion if he had held, perhaps His had beene dry now. Herm. Good heaven what a night's here, the Evening Promis'd dangers, but not like this: Sure this Barke Was one of that fleet that we saw off the point Last night, if we can recall life, He may informe us who they were. He stirres Son. He stirres and sighes still. Iudg. Wretched, wretched Theogines, what mercy Is this that at length has found thee? Was my selfe onely saved of this wracke? Her. All else perish'd. Iudg. Oh that I had mist this charity too My friend aged Pensius my brother Brave Memnon and my sonne the hopefull; All these my former losses have rob'd me of My griefe, which else these poore men Would have required of me. Oh equall heaven Thy abus'd Oracle and breach of vowes Thou now but begin'st to punish. Father by thy habit thou art vow'd Vnto the Gods, if then like me thou'lt not Be punish't for perjury, againe deliver me To the doome they appointed; and In the watery wombe of the Sea Intombe me. Her. Oh Sir, despaire not; they appoint us better Then we can choose, and in our greatest distrust Surprise us with their mercies. Iudg. Heare but what I am and thou'lt be affraid: To harbour me: for where e're I goe Their vengeance pursue me My name Theogines the Iudge. Blest with all that men call happinesse, Children wealth and power, to save or destroy Where I liv'd: And though our state forbad Kings, all but the name I possest, my brother They have punish'd raign'd chiefe Priest. As I rul'd Iudge equall in our birth's, Equall in our blessings, in our power equall And in our faults too alike guilty, But Not alike punish'd, for he I feare Is lost for ever: But the fault which now They are busie in punishing is this, 'twas By our predecessours enjoyned as A gratefull offering to peace, under whose protection We found such benefits, As all our neighbour countries Wanted; That it should not be lawfull For any to take up Armes but in their owne defence Nor any upon paine of perpetuall banishment Send their Sonnes abroad lest they might bring Home, the dang'rous customes of other countries. This Law was made and vowes with it Of the strictest eyes: This vow we vow'd And to this law with oathes were bound. Herm. What danger could that bring you? Iudg, O Father, this Law we broke and the curse Of this vow pursues us, we know we had Each of us a sonne and daughter, which blessings Made us covetous to have our sonnes succeede Vs in our honors, and therefore thought to breed 'Vm abroad, where they might learne to rule. Thus by ambition blinded he abus'd The Oracle, and told the people 'twas The will of the gods our sonnes should be sent Abroad, and I affirmed if they commanded The law assented. Then to the charge of A fatihfull friend we gave our children (Who were so young they knew not themselves What they were) with a command to breed 'um Fit to be Princes: But neither to the world Nor to themselves discover that they were so. Long this fault lay not hid, for the abus'd Oracle Vnask'd complaines, and to the incens'd people Tells our falsehood: By them we were banish'd Never to returne, which was some mercy, But alas! Fate was juster then the people For our sonnes are lost, my friend dyed and My brother in our pilgrimage by a strange accident Divided from me, Now ought I to hope for mercy, or wish To outlive their losses? Herm. Yee are not secur'd yet that these are losses Nor ha's any assured you they are dead, Therefore deferre this sadnesse, and let me Lead thee into my Cabbin. Iudg. O let me leane upon thy aged shoulder For I have load will sinke me. Herm. Doe: Sad time the while when I can be a stay To a Princes Sonne, make a fire upon the shore He makes a fire upon the Stage. That if any wretch unfortunate be cast Vpon this lone place they may see it, and Repaire hither, 'twill be some comfort To finde we have charitie. Exeunt. Scena Tertia. Enter three slaves. Storme Slaves. The Gods protect us and with all this judgement. Enter Gallippus. Gall. Hence yee dogges leave your howlings, death! Have we liv'd as if we hop'd for mercy, or Expected protection from our prayers be gone And endeavour: Every wise man rules His starres, and may deferre that fate which Prayer Cannot alter, see if I have not lost My power, why stay yee? who plyes the pumpe now? Sheele founder through the slaves negligence. Sla. Why should we labour against heaven That has decreed our losse, there's no hope We'are all lost, the Sea alreadie's our grave. Gall. Villaine thou shalt not dye by water, Ile bee thy fate. He stabs the Slave. And yours if yee stay Exeunt Slaves. Enter Zenon and Lutanthe. Zen. See if the storme has not wrought in her element Of water too, and blowne it in teares From her eyes. Gall. Would it had blowne the fire thence too, The earthly part would not wound me, my danger And their beautie in those active elements lye For in her living Iet fire beares sway. Zen. I will watch him. Steps aside. Gall. Will you yet grant my suite and yeeld me love, Or must I follow the example of the Gods, And in a storme compasse my will? Say Will you give, or shall I force? Luc. Is this a time for love, when the raging storme Drownes thy words? Oh thou abused power! Who thus enrag'd pursues us ev'n to the last Of all our name, and for abus'd sacrifice Will the Priest in judgement offer. If thou hast decreed my fall tak't while I am fit For sacrifice, while I'me pure and my virgin Snow Vnsoyl'd, and protect me from this Ravisher Whose impious heate burnes his hated breast Ev'n in the bosome of the Sea. Gall. Cease to curse and yeeld me love, thou see'st All the Ship is busie with apprehension Of our danger, which my love will not give Me leave to feare, thoughts of that take up All the roome here, that care of my selfe Cannot get in, Nor is this storme so dangrous, You're unacquainted, else youl'd finde it but noyse And not apprehend it. Lucan. Away, unhand me. He offers to take hold of her. Gall. To me tis no new things to see the Elements At warre, and strive againe to runne to Chaos Thousands of times have I naked stood the rage, When th'Element of fire has shot his angry flames Into the yeelding maine, as if he had meant To wound her god with his fork'd lightning, This I have seene and felt the mischiefes The unruly windes beget when they breake prison And force from the torne entrance of the earth, A dang'rous birth. Luc. O impious man! hast thou seene their power, And felt their mercy, and dost slight it? Gall. Slight it, no, nor feare it: I have seene A hideous storme grow from his nothing, and Look'd on Sea, heard the false winds whisper to her Till their flatteries have wrought into her bosome, And there fil'd with ambition the covetous Element That would aspire at heaven, discovering E'en to the eyes of men the secrets of Her wombe, This I have seene and these dangers Wrought through, Nor wil I beleeve any thing Can save me when I cannot save my selfe. Will you yeeld? Luc. Oh strange daring! quench his sawcy flames, or adde. Your fire to 'um, and hide your lightning in his lustfull breast. Foole and villaine I never met before: Though wise and wicked soldome joyne do'st tempt Me now with all my feares about me? If I were a common prostitute that were Acquainted with sinne; I durst not when Thunder speakes. Listen to thee, thy wickednesse Shakes even my reason; rather fall upon thy knees And no longer tempt the Gods to our destruction. Gall. Away I'me deafe. Lucan. Villaine wilt thou sinne, while His plagues hang over thee? And adde to thy faults While he is punishing? O yee winds take my teares Vpon your wings, and through this storme convey 'Vm to that youth, whose honour tooke me even I'th midst of my dangers, And Tell his faith unfortunately hath betrayd Me to this misery. Gall. Hah! is there another that you love? Nay then the earth shall not save thee. Enter Zenon. Zen. But it shall. Veere more sheate! Hale tacke aboard; Who's at helme? Master! Set a yare man to the helme, Thus, thus. Hel. Done 'tis. Zen. No more. Gall. Hell take thee for thy interruption. Exit Lucanthe. Zen.

But I'le never yeeld too't, nor sinke while These Oares can beare me through. Scena Quarta. Enter Hiparchus and Pausanes. Hip. Loose the slaves, we want men to trim our sailes. Pau. Oh Hiparcus that we had but The Pluto here, to bustle with this storme She would have layd her bough boldly in, And c'eav'd a growne Sea with her brazen prow: This is a painted whore, her backe too weake To beare her burden.

O ignorance of man! tis best seene In divers wayes that knowledge runnes, this their Art And wise direction is to me distraction: Oh Madam let me adde to these dangerous Multitude of waters my teares, that my repentance may Wash off this staine: 'Tis not the Sea I sinke under, but my faults to you. Can you forgive my blindnesse that has led You into dangers, accursed be that traytor, Villaine that brought 'um to that extreame, Those a land I could have redeem'd but this All these waters cannot prize. Euc. Tis not dangers fright mee, though yours bee joyn'd To them, for which Heaven knowes I have a paine, you prov'd such a friendly enemy: My griefe concernes not my selfe now, For I'm onely in the power of heaven, and The gods are no lesse strong at Sea than land And though their wonders dwell i'th deepe, yet Their mercies waite there too. King. Oh divine Eucratia! Let me kneele to thee, and in this storme call Vpon thy name to save me. Euc. Tempt not those powers which must protect us But joyne with me for my lost Sister poore Lucanthe, Who is not onely subject to this storme But the dangers too, with which a Traytors lust Begirts her, Oh Sir I know to dye Spotlesse is now her prayer, and all her wishes Include but what we pray against, a wracke.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus Scena Prima. Enter Gallippus with Lucanthe tyed to his backe and the knot in his mouth. The fire of lust and warmth which that heate lent, Gave me strength to resist this coldnesse of the water And to my appetite and longings the power That sav'd me: If I can call backe her life Ile sacrifice this lambe: To my backe I made Zenon binde her, that shee might not Have her will ere I had mine, which was To dye, the knot in my teeth I held, that when I could keepe her no longer she might slip, For my love 'tis vow'd to the living not the dead; And when I cannot what I woo'le, I woo'le What I can; to yonder fire which guided mee to this safetie I beare my load; when she begins to live I'le seeme to dye: And so i'le handle this chance And in oylie words clothe this service, Faintly pleading pardon for my past faults As if I had onely life enough to tell her The obligation she owes, then if I finde Her melt I'le by degrees I'le let her charitie prevaile And slowly seeme to recover. But if she Rejoyce in my fall, and my prayers faile, By all the Gods her's shall not prevaile. Exit. Scena Secunda. Enter the King, Eucratia Hiparchus and Pausanes all above. King.
