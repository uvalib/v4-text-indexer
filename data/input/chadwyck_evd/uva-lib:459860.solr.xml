      <field name="fulltext">THE FIRST ACT. Solymans Camp and his Pavillion. Enter Solyman, Rustan, Pyrrhus, and the Sultans Guards. Rust. What Influence, Mighty Sultan, rules the day, And stops your course where glory leads the way? Th'Hungarian Armies hasten from the Field, And Buda waits for your approach to yield; Yet you seem doubtful what you are to do, And turn from Triumphs when they follow you. Pyrrh. We at the Suns one moments rest should more Admire then at his glorious course before. Glory, like Time, progression does require, When it does cease t'advance, it does expire. Soly. You both mistake; my glory is the cause That in my Conquest I have made this pause; Whilst Hungary did pow'rful Foes afford, I thought her Ruine worthy of my Sword; But now the War does seem too low a thing, Against a Mourning Queen, and Infant King; Pyrrhus, it will unequal seem in me To Conquer, and then blush at Victory. Rust. None but the Conquer'd should have sence of shame. Shall shows of Vertue darken your bright Fame? Success does cover all the crimes of War, And Fame and Vertue still consistent are. In lazie peace let Christian Monarchs rust, Who think no War, but what's defensive, just. Our Valiant Prophet did by slaughter rise: Conquest a part of our Religion is. Pyrrh. He in his Holy War sounds no retreat, Accounting none Religious but the great; His Martyrs, not by yielding, glory gain; They th'other World, by Conquering this, obtain. Soly. To Rome I will my dreadful Ensignes lead, Rome which was once the Universal head, Which still the worlds important part controuls; Once she gave Laws to Kingdoms, now to Souls; To that great Conquest my designs I bend, This Kingdom is my way and not my end, Which now, since too much scar'd by my Alarms, Seems worthier of my pity then my Arms. Rust. Since Rome did once the Universe subdue, 'Tis now the only Conquest fit for you; But he who Conquests wisely has design'd, Does never leave an Enemy behind. Though all that Heav'n ere finish'd in a Man, Is now in you, yet Heaven's Great Agent can Proceed but as the Instrument of Fate, To work out Conquests, not at once Create; Beginnings should to th'end still useful be; 'Tis more to use then gain a Victory. Pyrrh. The Sword must end what Valour has begun, Else you disgrace what is already done; Your Foes would think if you should now relent, That you of Conquests as of Crimes repent. When your bright Crescents are to Buda shown, 'Tis but a step to the Hungarian Crown; Your presence lower then their knees will bring Th'Hungarian Priests to offer up their King. When by that proof your Conquest is confest, Dispose of him by rules of Interest. Soly. Bear then my Standard before Buda's Walls I should not stop my Ears when glory calls; Since there the Foe all his reserves does make, In taking Buda I the Kingdom take. Call the Divan, let them consult with you, What with the Infant King is fit to do. [Exeunt the two Bashas. Divans like Common-wealths regard not fame, Disdaining honour they can feel no shame; Each does, for what the publick safety call, Venture his Vertue in behalf of all, Doing by pow'r what Nature does forbid, Each hoping, amongst all, that he is hid, Hidden because they on each other wink, When they dare act what Monarchs scorne to think. [Exit. Enter Isabella Queen of Hungaria in Mourning, Cleora, Thuricus, Viche, and Attendants. Thur. In the Hungarian Council does appear Disorder vary'd in all shapes of fear. Viche. And in their looks too clearly I descry, They'l rather tamely yield then bravely dye. Queen. But yet the remedy by Death remains, When that may free them will they carry Chains? Their Souls are with their Armies overcome, They who the Bulwark were of Christendom, Shall now be made at once their scorn and shame: 'Tis less to lose their Countrey than their Fame. But though the frighted States should yield the Town, I am resolv'd ne're to resign the Crown: My care of that, and my neglect of Life, Are signs that I have been your Monarchs Wife. Thur. The death of that Great King for whom you Mourn, Did our advancing Empire backward turn; The Turks may now the Christian world out-brave, Since all our hearts lie buri'd in his grave. Enter the Cardinal of Veradium. Card. The Sultan's Army covers Budas hills, Which our Consulting States with terrour fills, Who hearing he to such has mercy shown, As, timely yielding, did his wrath atone; They will a sudden present to him bring, Worth more than all their lives, our Infant King. Queen. Give up the King! in that resolve I see Th'Hungarians now are ripe for slavery; The Prince, who from your King his birth did take, Shall not a part of Turkish triumph make; Death may, but fear shall never cast me down: Who yields, does ne're deserve to wear a Crown; Death shall us both in the first breach relieve, We'l die, since in the Throne we cannot live. Thur. Ah Madam, that which you have now design'd, Does more become your fortune than your mind; Let not your Vertue teach you cruelty. Queen. 'Tis worse to merit death than 'tis to die: A Queen who does resign her Son and State, Does use her self, worse than she's us'd by Fate. Card. Since now the States your broken Armies pay, The orders of the States they will obey; And what they have resolv'd, they soon will do, Therefore my Counsel, Madam, pray pursue; Since they have prov'd so false and so unjust, Turn what they make necessity to trust; Send the Crown-Jewels, and the Infant King To Roxolana as an Offering; Subdue that Beauty which the Victor sways, With what the Great are soonest conquer'd, Praise: Extol her Vertue, and her Mercy move, By all the Charms of pity and of love; In gaining her you make the Sultan sure, A desperate ill can have no common cure. Whilst with applause high minds you higher raise, You make them vertuous to make good your praise. Queen. The States, not I, this Counsel may esteem, 'Twill make me do what I abhorr'd in them; If by their Cowardice I am destroy'd, I'le bravely meet what I in vain avoid: Ah! 'tis enough my fate to undergo, Must I the Patient be, and Agent too? 'Tis Hazardous on th'Empress to relie, I by the Sultan's Conquest can but die; And 'twill less glory to my death afford, To perish by her sentence then his sword: By my own way I but to death submit, But if I follow yours I merit it; For when a Monarch is subdu'd by fear, What he does suffer he deserves to bear. Card. My way, the worst that can befal our King, Is to become his peoples offering; Of the two ills, which will the worser be, To die for them, or by their Treachery? Thus he'l afflict whom he can ne're reclaim, For sure the sharpest punishment is shame: The worse they are, his fate the better seems, When those who him destroy he thus redeems; Religion too makes it a greater thing, To die a Martyr then to live a King. Queen. My Lord, your pious reasons make me yield, Nature to Vertue should resign the field; Bring me, Cleora, my unhappy Son, And with him all the Jewels of the Crown; [Exit Cleora. You Thuracus on Embassy shall go To Roxolana's Tent, and let her know How much the common voice of Fame I trust, Which renders her compassionate and just; Whilst others say she all her sex exceeds, They shew their Faith by words, but I by deeds; I by so strange a trust may find relief, If she has vertue equal to my grief. Viche. Madam, she will not now by one mean act, A future stain on her past fame contract. Thur. Honour will make her value what I bring: 'Tis more to save then to destroy a King. Enter Cleora with the young King, and a Casket of Jewells, with Attendants. Queen. Ah! wou'd thy Cradle had been made thy Grave, Since born to be at once a King and Slave; In bonds thy fatal Reign thou dost begin, And thou art punish'd e're thou know'st to sin. Card. You feed your sorrow when you thus complain; Think not of loss, but count what you may gain; Fortune who leads him hence will bring him back, And long preserve what you a while forsake. Queen. My Lord, my sorrow seeks not your relief, You are not fit to judge a Mothers grief; You have no Child for an untimely grave, Nor can you lose, what I desire to have. Card. He'l be restor'd unless you hazard him, By losing time which none could ere redeem. Queen. I'l now seal up the heart which I must send In thee, to thy new-Mother and my Friend. [Kisses him Oh Heav'n perswade her that she both may prove, And that her power be equall'd by her love; Let me but seal't agen ere it does go: Two Seals th'importance of Dispatches show. [Kisses him agen. Card. Madam, we must by stealth our passage get: Our Guards are strict, and th'Ev'ning Watch is set. Queen. Be you his Nurse, Cleora, teach him how, He should to Heav'n with early homage bow; Teach him to sooth the Empress, and to be, A pretty supplyant for himself and me. [Exeunt several wayes, the Queen still turning her Eyes towards her Son, and weeping. Enter Mustapha, Zanger, Attendants. Must. Sure, my dear Zanger, those who heretofore, The envy'd Crown of this Great Empire wore; Nere knew the charms which Friendship do attend, Or in a Brother never had a Friend; Since he who Friendships sacred power has known, Rather than kill a Friend, would lose a Throne: Your Friendship at so just a rate I prize, As I for that this Empire can despise. Zang. That jealous care which on this Throne attends, Thinks those too great who merit to be Friends; None but an equal should in Friendship share, And Sultans of their equals jealous are: They think the proof of wisdom is distrust, And then believe, what ere is safe is just; Their fatal maximes made our Sultans still. As soon as they were Crown'd, their Brothers kill. Must. How can that wisdom in our Sultans be, Which of it self is fear and cruelty? If titles change th'intention of the Fact, Then justice weighs the Actor, not the Act; And who would not a Monarchy refuse, When, to gain pow'r, he must his nature lose, The vertue of that man was never strong, Who fear'd not more to do then suffer wrong. By our great Prophet solemnly I swear, If I the Turkish Crown do ever wear, Our bloody custom I will overthrow; That debt I both to you and justice owe. Zang. And here I vow by all that's good and high, I'le not out-live the day in which you die; This which my Friendship makes me promise now, My grief will then enable me to do. Must. My vow is seal'd. Zang. Mine Friendship shall make good. [They embrace. Must. Friendship's a stronger tye than that of blood. Enter Haly. Haly. Sir, the Divan in secret Council sit; The Sultan to their Judgment does remit The Summons or Assault of this proud Town, Or to demand the Infant with his Crown. Zang. If the Divan may of this Realm dispose, Th'Hungarians will have scarce enough to lose. Must. Councils dare do worse than their Monarchs dare; For where in evil many bear a share, They hardly count, when they divide the guilt, A drop for each, though streams of blood were spilt. [Exeunt. Enter Roxolana with her Train, Cleora, Thuracus with the young King, and a Casket of Jewels. Rox. She thinks that my compassion may be bought: You had the King without these Jewels brought, If she had held me worthy to have shown, That I without reward could save a Crown: She does at once what generous seems and low, What her trust builds, her gifts do overthrow. Bear back the remnants of her ruin'd State, And leave the Infant to expect his Fate. Thur. Great Roxolana cannot but excuse Those errors which our Queens respects produce; She makes for her offence no ill amends, When she dares trust that Vertue she offends; Nor has she cause that error to deplore, Which gives you power to shew your mercy more. 'Tis not below your fame, nor yet your state, To pardon faults your Glory does create; For if your Glory had been less sublime, You could not take her Present for a crime. These glist'ring Ornaments of Regal State, Become the Prosp'rous, not th'Unfortunate. Ah! to her errour, Madam, be more kind; The wrong she meant not, she the trust design'd. Rox. What I resolve, I change not through mistake; Leave here your King, but bear your Presents back. Cleora. This answer makes us both rejoyce and mourn; The greater gift you keep, the less return; Yet your protection cannot be deny'd: Honour and mercy ever were ally'd. [Exeunt Thuracus, Cleora, Roxolana, Lady carries away the Infant. Enter Zarma. Zarm. From the Divan, Rustan is hither sent, Who humbly begs t'attend you in your Tent. Rox. Admit him; this must of importance be; [Exit Zarma. He is a Cloud between the Sun and me. Achm. Your beams exhal'd what they may soon dispel; He'll shrink in lesser time then he did swell. Rox. He's now the Sultans, but I rais'd him first, And poyson'd him with power to make him burst. Enter Haly, Rustan. Rust. From the Divan, Great Empress, I am come; They have pronounc'd the Royal Infants doom; And now their Mutes at your Pavilion Gate, For execution on your pleasure wait. Rox. Can they contest with what they should despise? Or are they in such want of Enemies, As to pursue an Infant to my Tent? Rust. 'Tis said that he is here for refuge sent. Rox. Design of refuge sanctifies this place: Weakness pursu'd, shews strong pursuers base; The priviledge of refuge I'll maintain, And they not breaking it will honour gain. Rust. States may by honour lose, if they comply With mischiefs, because weak, or when they flye; They root up Infant Danger when it springs: None can fore-tell the height of growing Kings. Rox. The grave Divan in ruining their Foes, Are not concern'd when they may honour lose; Because it most reflects on future fame, But they seek present safety though with shame. Great Solyman, who has for honour fought, Does wisely prize what with his blood he bought; And what he values, I must value too; Doing like him, how can I better do? But the Divan and I shall vainly strive, Since from the Sultan they that power derive; By which for bloody int'rest they contend, And by his power, my honour I defend. Rust. Your beauty keeps all humane pow'r in awe: What can resist it, but our Prophets Law: The wise Divan, arm'd with Religious force, Contests not with your pow'r, but your remorse. Rox. Religion now does many faces bear, And all resemble those, who Copy her; You States-men in your own resemblance draw Her shape, by which you keep the world in awe, Rust. Fair Empress, when Religion does oppose What custom plants, or in our nature grows; We are incens'd, and yet we then forbear T'accuse the Law, but tax th'Interpreter; As men refrain to quarrel with the strong, But wrongs pretend from those whom they may wrong; Our Law offends them by their own mistake, Whilst what is merciful, they cruel make: This Infants blood will quench the flames of War; Millions of lives we by his dying spare. Rox. But can Religion with such ill dispence As harm prevents, by harming innocence. Rust. Shall true Religion (which must still declare Against all false Religions open War) Be less provided for offence then those, VVho practice policy as well as blows? Rox. Rustan, I did not think Camps could have bred One, whose Religion might in Temples plead For all that Heav'n enjoynes, and Hell resists: Rustan might lead an Army made of Priests. Rust. They fight for th'other World, and yield up this; Would I could lead them all to Paradise: But Madam, the Hungarian Child, to save, Contesting Armies from a publick grave, Should dye, if with his death you would dispence. Rox. I have some pity of his innocence. Rust. His early dying may his Soul prefer To th'other World, and may secure us here. Those, Madam, may rejoyce who upward go, And ought to pity us who stay below. Rox. Ah Rustan! you by soaring Vertue reach, Those heights of which our Priests can only Preach; My pity you correct, and then destroy, In pleading what the dead, by death enjoy; And now, to show I prize what you esteem, Call in my Mutes and bid them strangle him. [Pointing to Rustan. Rust. 'Tis much to say it, can you mean it too? [Exit Mitza. Rox. I'le not dissemble as you Viziers do. A Viziers power is but subordinate, Enter Mitza and the Mutes. He's but the chief dissembler of the State; And oft for publick int'rest lies; but I, The partner of Supreme Authority, Do ever mean the utmost that I say; Dispatch, he's such a Saint as needs not pray. Haly. Hold, hold. Rox. How Haly, by command from you? Haly. 'Tis but for leave that I may humbly sue. I can less doubt the justice of your will, Then that you here have priviledge to kill; The greatness of his crime none will suspect, Because he came t'invade, what you protect; But for that height of trespass let him live, Lest you should seem unable to forgive. Achm. You only mortal pow'r by killing show; But by forgiving it does Heav'nly grow: Th'Offender more your frowns, then dying fears. Rust. To me your anger, worse then death appears. Rox. Live, since my wrath does fear of death transcend, Live to continue, what thy death will end. Exit Rustan bowing low. Exeunt Mutes another way. Haly. He's gone to study what revenge can do, But, Madam, 'tis more safe for us that you Have left a Vizier living to complain, Then that the Sultan should have found him slain. Rox. Can you your safety doubt whilst you are mine? Achm. You and the Sun warm all things where you shine. Haly. Some flowers seem more then others to rely On the Suns favour, such as with his Eye Open and shut, and with his Noon grow strong, We like to those may flourish, but not long. Achm. The Sultan will not chide your violence, But make our knowing of it an offence; And we shall certain be of punishment, For knowing that which we could ne're prevent. Haly. He'l on your errours wink, as on his own, And think them punish'd in but being known. Enter Solyman. Achm. Our storm's already coming, would 'twere past. Haly. Before it falls, let us to shelter haste. Exeunt Achmat, Haly. Soly. We in our Camp want pow'r to check your will, And your Pavilion is your Cittadil; Which you with Dwarfs, and Mutes, and Eunuchs, man, To hold out siege against the whole Divan; This wonder I am told, if it be true, We must leave Buda to beleaguer you. Rox. I thought in gaining you, I gain'd the Field, And therefore would not to your Subjects yield. Soly. Fortune does blush at the bold minds of those, Who, what is long in gaining, rashly lose. Rox. Your Vizier is a most impatient Saint: He cannot suffer wrong without complaint. Soly. You would be terrible, yet pleasant too, And in gay humour when you mischief do; Can you, when sullen grown, be chearful made With no less sport then death in masquerade? My Vizier, on whose office I rely, Whose pow'r should advers Nations terrifie; You, for your Eunuchs, and your Dwarfs delight, To try his Valour, with Death's vizard fright. Rox. Had you not taught me, I had never known All Pow'r to be Phantastick, but your own. Soly. I'll teach you now that Death's a serious thing. Call for your Mutes, and for your little King! Rox. What is your meaning Sultan? Zarma stay! Soly. Ha! Is she doubtful whom she should obey? Rox. You rule enough, ruling the world and me; Pray let my Women, my own Subjects be. Soly. Your Subjects are not safe obeying you: They'l make my Mutes do more then yours should do. Rox. Your looks are chang'd, and many dangers there Assemble like black Clouds when storms are neare: Ah Sultan! what should Roxolana do, If, like your looks, your heart were alter'd too? Is it your pleasure that my VVomen bring, For your Diversion, Sir, the Infant King? Soly. Your question breeds delay, let him be brought. Your Women sure are Mutes, and only taught To know your signs for what they should not do; I'll send my Mutes t'instruct them when to go. The Women run out. Rox. Alas, their fear did make them loth to move: They fear your anger, but I trust your love. Enter the Women with the young King. Soly. Is this the thing that you would keep alive; For whom the Cross does with the Cressent strive; Nay, bring him near, his motion has a grace; And I perceive a promise in his face, That he'l perform what he declares in show, If destiny will give him leave to grow; His eyes do with a diff'rent lustre move, They threaten veng'ance, and they promise love. Rox. Pray look, methinks his features are not illâ But cruel Rustan, thinks I have no skillâ Poor Infant, none dare speak in thy defence, And thou want'st words to plead thy innocence. Soly. You are too fond, be tender of your own: They'l quit his company to get his Crown; If this seems strange I'll put you out of doubt; Zarma go call my Mutes, they wait without. Rox. Stay! Zarma stay! If this, Sir, be your doom, Send me too where the cruel never come; I'll bind him to me with my Arms and Hair; Then try, Sir, if your Mutes or Viziers dare Enforce him from the refuge of my Brest. Soly. Though with strange valour you are now possest, Yet surely, Empress, the Divan, and I, May charge with the most desp'rate Enemy: Your heart will yield after this raging fit. Rox. It may e're long, when you have broken it. [Weeps. Soly. Come, come! My Mutes, ending an Infants life, Which seems but new begun, will end our strife. Rox. The light of this new kindl'd life shall shine, Till those who put it out extinguish mine; Your Mutes may tremble and your Viziers too, Knowing what I have done, and still dare do. Soly. You will not sure with them and me contend. Rox. Against th'opposing world I will defend The life which in protection I receive; Sultan I'll do'tâIf you will give me leaveâ [Weeps. Soly. You, Roxolana, are the Conquerour. What storm is not allay'd by such a showre? I only try'd whether your Vertue were Above my anger, and your sexes fear: Since over both it does so nobly rise, It shall be more Triumphant then your eyes. Rox. By yielding you prevail, and your remorse Gains more then other Victors get by force. Soly. Your showre of Tears will make my Laurels spring, And growth does promise to this Infant King; He shall applaud your gentle Victory, For your remorse saves him and Conquers me. Exeunt. The young King, being led out between Solyman and Roxolana.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE SECOND ACT. Enter Roxolana, Zanger, Haly, Zarma, Achmat, and Attendants to them. Achm. Three Christian Ladies, who from Buda come, Wait for admittance in the outward room. Rox. Sure they are sent from the Hungarian Queen. Her fears have made her restless: bring them in. Zanger, your looks must now serene appear; Rustan must find no more foul weather here; He has endeavour'd to deserve his peace, Therefore your frowns must with my anger cease. Zang. The Vizier gains so much of your esteem, That I e're long may wish good looks from him. Enter the Queen of Hungaria, and two Ladies attending her. Queen. Madam, your favours have so prosp'rous been, And so obliging to th'Hungarian Queen (Still rising like your vertue and your power) That she does find her sense of it is more, Then she dares trust another to express, Therefore is now her own Embassadress. That high Compassion, Madam, by which you The Infant sav'd, has brought the Mother too; As the afflicted with Devotion run To Altars, where great Miracles are done. Rox. In this you trust my vertue, not my power; And whilst you are oblig'd, oblige me more. Queen. Those who at Altars blessings crave, may bring, There where they begging come, an offering; Which if they offer as a recompence For what they then implore, were an offence. But, Madam, I shal now a Present make. Of what I ought to give, and you may take: Buda, for your acceptance, Madam, waits: Your vertue, by a Charm, unlocks her Gates: Buda, will bow to you, though it the pow'r Proudly withstood of every Conquerour; By force ne're aw'd, nor stratagem beguil'd: Buda, the Virgin Town; which has been stil'd (When every Victor courted her to yield) The Mistress of the Master of the Field. Zang. Haly, we grow too great, Heav'n make us less, Since Conquests bring such beauties to distress. Methinks my Mother should more tender grow. Haly. You feel that pity, Sir, which she will show. Queen. I to your vertue now a Present make Of what the Sultans power could never take; So much your powerful vertue does oblige, That it does take what he can but besiege. Rox. Whilst thus you strive to make my vertue known, Madam, you show a greater of your own; And what I did, you now reward so well, As makes the recompence the Deed excel; Yet but a little vertue were in me, If I should now let yours, your ruine be. Queen. How can my gratitude my ruine bring, Trusting a Kingdom, where I trust a King? Pardon me, Madam, if I come to you, As all to Altars with self-interest do; Hoping they mighty blessings shall receive, For what they there in little offerings give: I give an Infant King whom all forsake, And of a Town besieg'd, a Present make; But you adopting him restore a Crown, And give a Kingdom, when you take a Town. The Sultan may his Armies valour spare, You by your single vertue end the War. Rox. Your vertue has a greater wonder wrought, It Conquers where it but protection sought; Above this height, Honour can never get, For it does Conquer, whilst it does submit. Madam, 'tis only Solyman and you Can boast they Roxolana did subdue; And that your triumph may the more appear, You in this very Camp have Conquer'd her: But you are now my Guest, and you shall stay, Till you at least believe that I'll repay What you with more then gratitude have done: Madam, I know you long to see your Son. Zanger, attend the Queen, and let her be, By finding your respects, assur'd of me. Exeunt several wayes, Zanger leading out the Queen. Enter Rustan, Pyrrhus. Rustan. She o're his heart still more victorious grows, And faster Conquers him, then he his Foes. Pyrrh. Your dark designs are all in vapour gone, They are but Clouds, her beauty is the Sun. Great Fav'rites seldom their resentments hide; Revenge shows not their anger, but their pride; She'l be reveng'd that you her power may see. Rust. 'Twill her least mischief seem to ruine me: She with the wind and tide of favour flows. Pyrrh. Row with that stream which strength cannot oppose: Swell up her Sails with praise and flattery. Rust. Those are low Courtships for a Soul so high; Such common fawning she'l despise or hate, She must be tempted with a subtler bait: I must engage her by some bold design, In which her Int'rest with great crimes may joyn: The Great can never love, because too high For that which Love allows, equality; But they to those they fear will favour show, And they fear those, who their great mischiefs know, Knowing her guilt, I may her favour find; Guilt next to Love, above all ties do bind: Her heightn'd mind and nature much disdain, That Mustapha should over Zanger raign; I can assault her only on that side, Making her vertue vassal to her pride. Pyrrh. Advance, Sir, this design e're she can know, What for her sake you have begun to do; Honour or craft may make her else to shun The sin design'd, which she'll applaud when done. Rust. And, Pyrrhus, 'twere no little mark of skill To make her think, when I oppos'd her will, 'Twas only that I might the Sultan blind, More safely to effect what I design'd; My faults to her shall such deserts appear, As she shall thank me that I injur'd her. Pyrrh. If she discerns you not through your disguise, She who has caught the Sultan, is your prize. Rust. I should her Friendship wish, were Friendship more Then a meer name 'twixt those who covet power; You shall but Eccho what I have begun, To make the Father jealous of the Son. I with the Sultan durst at first proceed, Only so far as might attention breed; Last night some words I artfully did say, From Fame, not from my self, of Mustapha, Which might the Sultan's jealous anger raise, Not words of accusation, but of praise: For nothing can old Monarchs more offend, Then when their Successors we much commend: I quickly found that he was loth to hear, Therefore by pause and parcel in his Ear, Did civilly that poyson, Praise, infuse, As men unwilling seem to tell ill news. Pyrrh. His first Disease is fixt, what can remove The Jealousie of Empire, or of Love? Rust. Now I that fatal seed have own, 'tis fit That I attend on time to ripen it. Pyrrh. When fancy to that fruitful weed does give But any root, 'twill grow whilst it does live. Enter Zanger, and Achmat, at distance from him: Zang. Warm me, and quench me, for I freeze and burn, And at one object both rejoyce and mourn: What mean'st thou Nature, is it bad or good, Which makes this April-weather in my blood? Achm. I fear he has with two much passion seen The charming eyes of the Hungarian Queen; I saw him gaze on her with such review, As if he fear'd the object were not true: So miracles are seen by faithless men, Who stay and fain would see them o're agen. Zang. Oh Achmat! something does my heart pursue: I wander from my self, and flye from you. Achm. This, Sir, seems one of Loves great extasies. Zang. I would I knew what 'tis not, or what 'tis; Love to my breast hath still a stranger been; And yet that stranger may be gotten in. Achm. Ah Prince! the secret passage of Loves flight Is as unseen by day, as 'tis by night. Though Buda should her Walls like Mountains rear, And Solyman could never enter there, No not with Armed Crowds the Out-works win, Yet Love un-arm'd would by surprize get in. Zang. Love is a god, and cannot be withstood: Achm. Yet he's a god only to flesh and blood: For those whose Souls are active and sublime, Resist his power, and so prove gods to him. Zang. Ah! talk not of resistance of his force, Whom nothing Conquers but his own remorse: I rather would, if e're he Conquer'd you, Be told how first he did your heart subdue. Achm. As quietly as day does vanquish night, I heard no noise, but saw resistless light. Zang. He does, alas! with quiet force begin, But Oh! What does he do, when enter'd in? Achm. My waking thoughts I still for dreams did take, And whilst I dream't, I thought I was awake: With equal view, in darkness as in light, Ciara's image entertain'd my sight: If she was absent, sorrow made me pale; If she appear'd, then blushes did prevail: What her concern'd, did me more meerly touch. Zang. I know too little, and I hear too much: Oh Achmat! cease and instantly retire, Your words are more than fuel to my fire. Exeunt several waies. Enter Solyman, followed at distance by Rustan, Pyrrhus. Soly. Rustan does know much more then I dare hear: Can I a Monster breed, which I can fear? I find suspition a sufficient pain, Fear is a torment, which I should disdain: He robs my heart of all the Calms of rest: I'le tear the dire Usurper from my breast: Rustan is full of try'd integrity, And servants often, more then Parents see. Pyrrh. He has more thoughts then he has skill to use. Rust. The poyson of my whisper does infuse. Oh cursed Court! where not to be the most In sight and eminent, is to be lost; Where still the weary by false steps must climb, And yet their falling is esteem'd a crime. Soly. Rustan, my privacy you now invade. Rust. Sir, it is self-invasion to be sad. Soly. Have you a Cure; you brought the malady; I say you brought it. Rust. Heav'n defend me! I? Soly. Do you suspect the truth of what I said? Rust. Would I had been unborn, or worse then dead; Rather then e're have caus'd a grief in you, To whom the comforts of both worlds are due. Soly. You talk'd to me, and took my sleep away. Rust. Could I in words, too much my duty pay? 'Twere better I should perish in despair, Then you should grieve one moment. Soly. So it were. Rust. Sir, you but heard what I was bound to say. Soly. What was it that you spake of Mustapha? Rust. I did with joy acquaint you, that your Son Nobly the hearts of all your Army won: Your dreaded anger I had justly rais'd, If I your dearest pledge had falsly prais'd, To sooth you with fictitious flattery; But Pyrrhus knows it true, as well as I, Pyrrh. 'Tis true, that he is generous and good; He will succeed by vertue, as by blood. Rust. This, Sir, should cause your joy and not your grief. Soly. Canst thou believe my pain will find relief In that which shows the justice of my fears? Did I in Winter Camps spend forty years; Out-wear the Weather, and out-face the Sun, When the Wild-Herds did to their Coverts run; Out-watch the Jealous, and the Lunatick, Out-fast the Penitential, and the Sick; Out-wait long Patience, and out-suffer Fear, Out-marches the Pilgrim, and the Wanderer: And there, where last years Ice was not unthaw'd, (When in thick Furs, Bears durst not look abroad) I with cold Armour cover'd, did maintain Life against showres of Arrows, and of Rain? Have I made Towns immur'd with Mountains yield; Sent haughty Nations blushing from the Field? And must I, at one cast, all that I forego, For which so oft I desperately did throw? They steal my Laurels to adorn my Son; Who can but dream of Fields that I have won? [Enter Roxolana. Rox. What valiant power can be secure from fear When, Sultan, we your voice of anger hear? Who dares that anger raise, and hope to live? Soly. If Mustapha usurps, shall I forgive? Rox. He is your Son, and is your eldest too; And may show faults, which others must not do: Nature will tell you, Sir, how farr in him You ought to pardon any gallant crime. Soly. Nature may yield when I my power out-live; For when I cannot punish, I forgive. Rox. His youth, Sir, has not only time to mend, But has some license also to offend; And since too apt for errours being young, Some may advantage take to do him wrong; And, whilst they Jealous of your glory seem, Assume a priviledge to darken him. Soly. He Courts my Armies to usurp their love. Rox. Can that your Jealousie to anger move? Their love you purchas'd, when you bravely fought; Let him inherit what for him you bought: They show their love to you in loving him. Soly. They, loving him too soon, make love a crime! He knows by study of Usurpers Arts, That he commands their hands, who gains their hearts: Him whom they love, they still most worthy deem. Rox. You have more pow'r o're him, then he o're them; He will confine that pow'r which love does get. Soly. Pow'r never to its self could limits set; It never thinks it lives, but whilst it grows, And what it can perform, it ever does. Rust. Our Sultans have their ripe Successours sent To some remote and quiet Government; Why since that rule is safe, and ancient too, Should it for Mustapha be broke by you? Soly. I did it out of tender care to breed His youth, and make him worthy to succeed. Rust. But if, when popular, he does express A slow requital of your tenderness; Which Heav'n forbid, then you may soon remove His person, till you can reclaim his love. Rox. Sure, Rustan, you with too much vigilance, Turn to design, and purpose, things of chance; And, over-watchful with the eyes of fear, Draw little objects, from wide distance, near; And see them double, whilst you seem to make All that, which is your malice, your mistake; But do not fasly, as a Spy, prevail, Because a Son may in his duty fail. Rust. Madam, I cannot over-watchful be In what concerns the Sultan more than me: I humbly take the priviledge to say, That you connive too much at Mustapha, And have of late been slow and negligent, In what your care could not too soon prevent: And, Madam, this perhaps you wisely do, T'avoid report, grown publick, though not true; Which is, that with a Byas still you run To follow Zanger, your neglected Son. Soly. No more, these are the rising mists that make Those stormy winds, that keep me still awake! [Exit Solyman. Rox. Rustan, you must by fresh intelligence Charge Mustapha, and with some new offence. Rust. Madam, I am engag'd past all retreat. Rox. Go and attend me when the Watch is set: Exeunt Rustan, Pyrrhus. These little Arts great Nature will forgive: Dye Mustapha, else Zanger cannot live! Pardon, oh Solyman, thy troubl'd Wife; Who must her duty lose, to save a Life; A Husband venture to preserve a Son; Oh! that's the fatal rock that I would shun: For Solyman, must Mustapha deprive, Of that lov'd Life, by which himself does live: And Mustapha, to his untimely grave Must hasten, that his death may Zanger save. Oh cruel Empire! that does thus ordain Of Royal Race the youngest to be slain, That so the eldest may securely Reign; Making th'Imperial Mother ever mourn, For all her Infants in succession born: Excuse, oh Nature, what by me is done, If it be cruel to preserve a Son! [Exit. Enter Mustapha, Zanger. Must. If it be Love, and you against it strive, Then greater strength you to your torment give: Love may all hearts under his Empire bring, Since to resist, and yield, is the same thing. Ev'n Reasons power is useless against Love, For when he enters, reason does remove; And from your force of anger he is free, Since none with what they love can angry be: In vain you this unequal War abide, When all your aids turn to your Conqu'rours side. Zang. I do not, Sir, to Love, but grief submit. Must. Your grief I know not, yet I share in it: A friend is griefs Physitian, and may heal Your pain, if you the cause of it reveal; But you, by hiding that which should be known, Give me a torment greater than your own; And do ev'n worse then when you shun relief; For you kill him who comes to cure your grief. Zang. Ah Prince! since I the weight of grief deplore, You are unkind in loading me with more. Must. But you transgress against all Friendships Laws, Shewing effects, when you conceal the cause; When those you cannot hide, these should be told; Those show themselves, but you must these unfold. Zang. Your Enemy much rather than your Friend, Shou'd tell you griefs which you can never end. Must. Friendship will nothing like reserves endure, But loves to share in griefs it cannot cure. Zang. Then will I throw my vain defence away, And, though obedience useless be, obey. You know what by my Mother has been done For the Hungarian Queens abandon'd Son. Must. Yes, and the Deed was for her greatness fit. Zang. The Queen her self is come t'acknowledge it: And that her gratitude may clearer shine, She does strong Buda, as a gift resign. Must. They may, by vertue urg'd, for honour strive; But why should this make Noble Zanger grieve? Zang. Can fate bring greater grief to me or you Then now, when the subdu'd do us subdue? We have by Arms th'Hungarian Kingdom won, And by their Queen in honour are out-done: A Crown resign'd my Mother ought to quit, Since she by keeping does not merit it: Can you my sorrow for my Mother blame, Who now must lessen in her Pow'r or Fame? Must. In such a choice she cannot chuse amiss; But, Zanger, there is in it more then this. Zang. Ah Prince! much more indeed, for had you seen The griefs and beauties of the Christian Queen, You would have felt the trouble which I had; These did to pity, those to love perswade: They help'd each other to perform their part, Grief softn'd, and her beauty seal'd my heart; Through all her blacks the lustre of her eyes Shew'd like the Sun when it from night does rise: But I want words for what I should commend. Must. How soon from liking we to love ascend! Zang. When she her Royal Infant did embrace, Her Eyes such floods of Tears showr'd on her face, That then, oh Mustapha! I did admire How so much Water sprang from so much Fire: And, to increase the miracle, I found At the same time my heart both burnt and drown'd. Must. What you have told, seems miracles to me. Zang. You will see greater when the Queen you see. Must. To me no miracle can greater prove Then seeing Friendships right resign'd to love: Your Heart once lost your Friendship too must end. Zang. Sure I may have a Mistress and a Friend. The Soul, dear Mustapha, is Friendships part, And Love for his does challenge but the heart? Must. That's a distinction made by couz'ning Art; Can I your Friendship have, and not your Heart? Such Lovers Logick is too low for you; What love a Captive, and a Christian too? Zang. How ill the name of Captive does beat A mind that conquers when it does submit? Her abject fate who would not undergo That she might Vertue in such Triumph show? Must. Though Friendship may in just perswasion fail, Yet, Zanger, your Religion should prevail. Zang. Since Nature no Religion knows but Love, He that loves most, does most Religions prove: Religions true design in Love consists, Heav'n owns not that which States-men teach our Priests. I love, but when I on the Queen reflect, The cause will more than justifie th'effect. Must. By seeing of your shipwrack I'll grow wise. Zang. How can I shipwrack't be on Paradise? Must. Something in your concern I hope to do: Farewel; I must condemn and love you too. [Exeunt severally. Enter the Cardinal with Papers in his hand, Viche, and an Hungarian Gentleman. Card. This for the Governour with your first speed, This for Count Urick, this for Ulfinshed, These are the Bills which will be paid at sight. Gent. Is it your pleasure I return at night? Card. You must, and learn who of the Garrison Form'd the revolt: be careful, and be gone. [Exit Gentleman. Viche. Fortune's before you wheresoe're you come; You'l happy be ev'n out of Christendom. Card. I shall be, if she end as she begun. Viche. You are for Roxolana's darling Son. The glorious Zanger has a Message sent, Which says, he means to find you in your Tent; He whom our Queens bright beauty did surprize. Card. A Lover speaks at first but with his eyes; But if he now hath found his tongue, he'l say Something which I perhaps am to convey. Viche. Their happy interview may raise us all: Men may look up who to the bottom fall. Card. My Lord, his visit seems design'd in haste, And to receive him I'll prepare as fast: You must not go to Buda; you shall stay And wait for our success: the Mirtle may (Which does a forward Spring already show) Even in a Camp where all things wither, grow: In fames records 'twill no great wonder prove, If we, who fell by hatred, rise by love. [Exeunt several wayes. Enter Mustapha and the Queen. Must. Madam, your fortune would malicious be, And make your beauty your worst Enemy. I know with reason, Madam, you depend On Roxolana, as your potent Friend; But whilst she labours to restore your Throne, Your beauty makes a Captive of her Son; When she does that unhappy Conquest know, Your kind Protectress will become your Foe. Whilst fate against your beauty does conspire, I grieve at the perfection I admire. Queen. Do not believe, Great Prince, your Brother will Submit to eyes where grief inhabits still; To eyes in which there nothing now appears To move a heart, unless it be their tears; You but mistake his pity for his love. Must. Thy passion, Zanger, why did I reprove? [Aside, Madam, where grief and beauty so excel; Pity and love may both together dwell; They both are but his duties sacrifice, This to your fate is due, that to your eyes. Queen. Your Vertue which does thus my fate lament, May all the malice of that fate prevent; Conquering a fortune so perverse as mine, Will make you brighter than in Battel shine. Must. Oh Heav'n! I feel my own subjection near, Even then when she would have me rescue her. Queen. Fortune in this has made her last assault, She'd have me bear what is alone her fault, And make the Empress think that I design What cannot be her trouble more than mine. Believe me, Gen'rous Mustapha, these eyes Which made the last Hungarian King their prize, Deserve more grief than to his Urn they pay, When they do ought but weep themselves away. Must. Whilst they shin'd out, who could resist their pow'r, VVhich, through griefs clouds, crowns you a Conquerour? Queen. Your Brother, when his passion seeks relief, May owe his Cure to reason and my grief; It will a blemish to his Vertue be, If he with fortune join to ruine me; And Roxolana's fame he much neglects, In making her destroy whom she protects: This you may tell him, Sir; and tell him too, I had not sent him Counsel but by you. Must. How, Madam, with your Counsel can you trust One whom already you have made unjust? For I shall give to Zanger, for your sake, Counsel which I my self can never take. Queen. Were you unjust when you did well express The danger I incurr'd by his address, And counsell'd me t'advise him to refrain From love, which would his Mothers hatred gain? The Counsel is not alter'd, but the same. Must. But I am alter'd since I hither came. Queen. It is not fit you should be understood, I know you cannot change from what is good; My case with pity should your heart inspire. Must. Ah! who can pity what he does admire? Your pity to my case is rather due: How can I give that which I need from you? Madam, I but in vain strive to conceal A passion which my vanquish'd eyes reveal; Instruct me how my self I should reclaim, Before I Zanger for his passion blame; Or rather teach us both how to endure That wound, which you declare you cannot cure; And do not trust our reason to subdue A love, which reason does invite us to. Queen. Oh Heav'n! in what wild Ocean am I lost? The Tempest rises and I see no Coast. Must. Zanger, not you, may tax me of a crime; I came to counsel you from love of him; But you, when you avoid my love, prevent All he could wish me for a punishment; Your int'rest brought me here to keep you free From such a love as might your ruine be; Let me, when gone, at least your pity have, Dying for you whom I did come to save. Queen. You cannot be so cruel as you seem: Why do you break that heart which you esteem? Leave me, you must not love, and should not hate One cruel made by rigour of her fate. Must. You should not of your destiny complain, You are depos'd but with more power to reign. Queen. Fate of this little beauty took a care, Only by that to heighten my despair. Since you resolve to stay, I must be gone, True grief endures not any looker on; And mine I feel to such a height does rise, That 'twill I hope revenge me of my eyes. [Exit. Must. She is as tyrannous as she is fair, Born to breed love, and to beget despair; I did lament her fortune, but I see One much more cruel is reserv'd for me. Can Zanger, for my love, my friendship blame, When the same fire does us alike inflame? My weakness cannot forfeit his esteem, Since I but yield to that which conquer'd him; To love whom he first lov'd, can be no more Then if I hate whom he did hate before. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE THIRD ACT. Enter Mustapha, Rustan, Pyrrhus. Rust. 'Tis, Sir, the Sultans will to have it so. Must. Toward's Syria! and to morrow must I go? The order is severe, and I am sent, Not to a fair retreat, but banishment. My memory is ill if I have done Ought that should make a Father hate a Son. Rust. Great Sir, take heed lest you his kindness blame, He sends you not to exile, but to fame; His Asian Armies will be led by you: Whilst he the West, you must the East subdue: Since for high valour and for conduct too, The publick voice allows that each of you Is for the spacious worlds whole Conquest fit, Why here should both subdue but part of it? Must. You hold me up too high when I am prais'd, I like a Meteor waste by being rais'd; I am already by my Friends undone, Praising the little Battels I have won; And I the Persians should subdue in vain, Losing a Father when I Persia gain. Pyrrh. Your Father this distemper should approve, Since you but jealous are of him you love. Rust. If his displeasure hastens you away, Do not increase it by desire to stay; Or if his jealous love sent this command, Yet do not inconvenient love withstand. Pyrrh. Which way soever you consider it, You should approve his orders and submit. Must. I'm debter to you both; leave me a while That I may grief and duty reconcile. Rust. You'l be defended against all offence, Adding but patience to your innocence. Exeunt Rustan, Pyrrhus. Enter Zanger observing him. Must. Fortune did never in one day design For any heart, four torments great as mine; I to my Friend and Brother Rival am; She, who did kindle, would put out my flame; I from my Fathers anger must remove, And that does banish me from her I love; If, of these Four, the least a burden be, Oh how shall I support the other three? Zang. Can my dear Mustapha a grief admit, And not let Zanger know the cause of it? Must. I having Zangers Friendship how could Fate Destroy my peace but by my Fathers hate? Time does too long with the afflicted last, But now in my affliction moves too fast; To morrow from to day will quickly grow, And I to morrow must tow'rds Syria go, Unless your pow'r with Roxolana can Revoke the order sent by Solyman. Zang. Depart tomorrow! no, let time run on; My Mother stays, and you are yet not gone. Sir, are you not of Zangers friendship sure? And can you mourn for ills which he may cure? But why do you aloud your grief deplore, When I am silent, though I suffer more? If by your foes you are to Syria sent, You'l there in Armies gain by Banishment: Persia, not you, th'event of this should fear, Since by that hatred which does send you there You will prevail as Victor of the field; But Love stays me, where like his slave I yield. Must. The highest glory conquest can bestow I would not purchase by my leaving you. Zang. To any Deity, but Love, men come With open glory to their Martyrdom; But I must perish and conceal my flame, As if to be his Martyr were a shame. Must. Yet no affliction, Zanger, can transcend The grief of being banish'd from a Friend. Zang. My grief much greater is, whilst I remain Near her I love, and am not lov'd again. Oh my dear Mustapha! when you have seen The Tears and Beauties of th'Hungarian Queen; Her Tears forbidding whom her Eyes invite, Whilst she appears the joy and grief of fight; Whilst empty hope does rise but to decline; Then you will think your sorrows less then mine. Must. Alas! you saw not more then I did see; She who did conquer you, ha's conquer'd me; And now I may my grief to yours prefer, Since I am banish'd both from you and her. Zang. Ha! Did you see her, Sir, and see her so, That from my friend you did my Rival grow? You made your visit in a fatal hour. Must. You know her eyes, and can you doubt their power In blaming me you will detract from them; As those who do the conquer'd much condemn, Do then disparage him who overcame; Since all may yield to Worthies without shame. None could her force resist, and how could I Then chuse but yield? for none can from her flye. Zang. Though we but seldom the subdu'd condemn When we the Victors conduct much esteem; Yet they are less excus'd if they did know, From others harms, the forces of the Foe. Must. If, Zanger, freedom of confession may The anger due to an offence allay, Then I acknowledge I my visit made, That from your Love I might the Queen disswade; Yet 'twas in fear, lest whilst you did pursue Your Love, your Mother might abandon you: But if you had beheld that breaking light, Which like a sudden dawn surpriz'd my sight, Love would have seem'd 'gainst friendship a less sin, Then not to love against her eyes had been; I struggl'd much e're I his Fetters wore; But that resistance show'd her power the more; And where resistance could not conquest stay, It was discretion quickly to obey. Zang. Yet we may just to one another prove; You are the Heir to Empire, I to Love; You as the Eldest may the Scepter bear, You first the world did see, I first saw her; And as I no invasion would design Against your right, so you should leave me mine. Must. If by meer sight we may possession take, How vain is that long Love which Lovers make? None but the sleepy can their fortune doubt; Men need but rise betimes and look about: But she must be by merits claim possest, And he who loves her most, deserves her best. Zang. Deserves her! This all injuries exceeds; Her, by your words you wrong, me by your deeds; He of her Love unworthy does appear, Who does but think that he can merit her; It may of her, ev'n as of Heaven be said, Which, though attain'd, is never merited; If loving her can any merit be, Who is the man that dares contend with me? Must. I am the man who silence all that boast How much they love; for I love more and most; And will not such a wretched Lover be, As meerly to depend on courtesie. He who declares that he no merit has, Then when he loves, does heedlesly disgrace Her whom he thinks he highly does prefer, By saying, that no Love can merit her; As if her Vertue could not soon improve To her own value all that dare make Love. Love makes both sexes equal and but one; A Cottage-Lover may deserve a Throne. Love is, like Valour, still improv'd by praise, And whilst I thus Love's merit highly raise: I would not the rewards of it destroy; The beauty whom I love I must enjoy. Zang. Did ever Love assume a shape like this? Or Passion talk with such an Emphasis? Your sence of Banishment does dang'rous grow, It sends your reason from you e're you go. Must. Zanger, you may my Banishment approve, Because my absence may promote your Love. Zang. Affliction makes men wise, but seldom vain: You fear your absence more than her disdain. The Empress strait still in your cause appear, And get you License to continue here; And since you height of Love as merit boast, Make good your claim by daring to love most. Must. What destiny ordain'd me to contend Against so brave a Rival and a Friend? And yet my passion I must still pursue: Let Love which makes my fault, excuse it too. Exeunt several wayes. Enter Solyman, Rustan, Pyrrhus. Soly. Were my Commands with such surprize receiv'd? Pyrrh. He seem'd as much amaz'd as he was griev'd. Rust. Wonder and grief did his condition fit, Though each did seem to th'other opposite; Wonder inferr'd he knew not his offence, But so much grief disgrac'd his innocence. Pyrrh. Yet grieving for a punishment from you, He does but pay that sorrow which is due. Rust. When your dislike does up to anger climb, You reach too high for an intended crime; Such grief as his no fiction could admit. Soly. I may believe he did not counterfeit; For having on my stage begun his part, I call'd him off e're he could show his Art. Rust. Can he, who is so highly born and bred, Walk under ground, and be by Traytors led? Soly. From harmless Child-hood I with tender care Did breed him up to all the harms of War; I taught him, that unguarded innocence Serv'd but to tempt the powerful to offence; That none are safe from wrongs, but when so strong As alwaies to be able to do wrong; That only valour is true faith, and those Do most trust Heav'n who alwaies life expose; I taught him Vertue, and to love her so As tame Philosophers durst never do; Enduring for her sake the pangs of power, And all the toyls that make a Conquerour: For none but Chiefs who firmly these endure, Can reach such pow'r as may the good secure: I taught him such a greatness as might be From all the yokes of Subjects counsel free: None but our Prophet Empire understood, Which, when 'tis bounded, ceases to be good; His Sword did two Usurping Saints devour; Forbidding ev'n the Saints to share his power: He blest Heav'ns King who Monarchy first made, And prais'd him cause he no companion had. All this I taught my Son; but when we give Our young Successours counsel how to live, They are in haste, thinking we do them wrong, And we their lives mis-spend when we live long. Enter Roxolana. Rox. Forgive me, Sultan, if I boldly sue In Natures cause between your Son and you; Those orders which to Mustapha you sent, His filial kindness takes for Banishment. When you your Successours so far remove, Reason may make him jealous of your Love; I'le answer for the kindness of his grief, And you'l want pity if he wants relief. Soly. Alas! tis far above a Womans art To reach the height of an aspiring heart: He who, by craft, my Armies love procures, Can never want the cunning to gain yours. Rox. Seduce your Armies love! no humane skill Can do it, and, I hope, he wants the will. Soly. The Nations whom I lead will not seem strange, If they, like other Nations long for change; For men of what they have soon weary grow, When they the utmost value of it know; And long to change plain things, which they possess, For that which hope does gild with promises. Rox. Be to your self and to your Army just: You should their love and your own merit trust. Prodigious jealousie, how can it shoot And spring to such a height without a root? Soly. It may a while be hidden from your eye; For roots are deepest where the trees are high. Rustan and Pyrrhus can direct your sight; But they a Curtain draw before the light. Rox. Perhaps they find what they are loth to see; Vertue in others may offensive be To some, who when it is to lustre grown Are jealous that it may Eclipse their own. Sultan, no Curtain can be drawn so wide, That it the Sun can from the people hide: The world is full of Mustapha's renown. Rust. Yet we offend in telling what is known. Rox. You injure him whose vertues you conceal. Rust. We need not shew what does it self reveal. Soly. I tax them not that they his Vertue hide, But they conceal the danger of his pride: His race of glory is too soon begun. Rox. None blame the early rising of the Sun, Nor wish for Clouds his lustre to disgrace. Soly. But if he shines too fully in myface, I'le draw a Curtain and his lustre hide; His glory shall not make me turn aside. The shining Mustapha must change his Sphear; He threatens me worse than a Comet here. Rox. Can Solyman by those forsaken be Whom he so often led to Victory? Soly. They by the many Battels I have won, Think all the stock of my success is gone: Though fortune often grac'd me in the field, And many favours hung upon my shield; Yet now cold looks men to my winter bring, Whilst they rejoyce at my Successour's spring: Fortune they think is to his youth in debt, And what she pays to him they hope to get. Rox. Though glory may a while his youth mis-guide, Yet he has duty to correct his pride, Nature does give him counsel against this. Soly. Pride is more natural then duty is; Duty is only taught by care and Art, Pride is by nature planted in the heart: He who to Empire hastily aspires, Is only counsell'd by his own desires; And thinks all crimes which help him to a Crown Are then absolv'd when he does put it on. Rox. I fear you have discover'd more then I Discern'd, who on your judgement must rely; Therefore, in care of you, I beg he may For a few dayes have liberty to stay: That license is to narrow time confin'd: If he has any publick crime design'd, He must by many hands assisted be: Crouds are inconstant and want secresie: If guilty, why should you his death delay? If innocent, he then may safely stay: Your anger ought to kill where it does touch; His Exile is too little or too much. Pyrrh. When in few dayes this secret shall look out, Punish his crime, or else suppress his doubt. Rust. Be pleas'd t'allow what th'Empress does advise, And seem to wink, whilst we imploy our Spies; Your doubts will just appear, or quickly cease, Excuse your anger, or restore your peace: Let not the Prince, whilst thus suspected flie Beyond the reach and terrour of your eye. Soly. Go, I'le consider e're I change his doom; I'le reckon what is past, and what may come. Exeunt Rustan, Pyrrhus. Oh Roxolana! Fate in vain bestows Continual Conquests o're my open Foes; Whilst it a tumult raises in my brest, Fiercer than all those Wars I have supprest. Justice perswades what nature fain would shun. Pity a father who must hate his Son. [Exeunt. Enter the Queen and Zanger. Zang. He who can all his love contain in words, Has such a heart as little love affords. Queen. He has too much for those who none return: You know my sorrow, and for whom I mourn: From such a guilty person you should flie As does the duty want by grief to die. Zang. I would not in my wishes covet more Then to change fates with him whom you deplore: You crown'd him with your love when he did live, And to his death your life in sorrow give. But, Madam, why will you so highly grieve, For one more happy dead, than I who live? You are in this unjuster then your Fate, Wasting your sorrows on the fortunate. Heav'n did his death design to make it known That you a blessing are too great for one. The Christian world did to your beauty bow, Which o're our larger world must govern now. Queen. In pity and in prudence, Sir, forbear, To speak what my discretion should not hear. Zang. Lovers high thoughts to wonders are inclin'd; And boundless thoughts suit not with speech confin'd. I wonder much how he, whom you bemoan, Having your love, could not defend your Throne; And how by any force he was supprest, Whilst with the influ'ence of your favour blest. But, Madam, now his losses you repair, For you revenge all his defeats in War; Fate did deny his Sword success in fight, Only by that to do your beauty right. Queen. Your raising me by your depressing him, May find my hatred seeking my esteem. Enter Mustapha. Zang. Ha! I employ'd my Mother for his stay, And Rival-like he hastens me away; But I'm past hope, and need no Rival fear. Must. This visit without leave may rude appear: Yet, Madam, when you shall vouchsafe to know That I to morrow must tow'rds Syria go; Th'opininion of my rudeness you'l re-call: I must attend you now or not at all. Think on a Lovers sorrow, who removes From seeing and from serving what he loves; Whilst he suspects those blessings are design'd For a more happy Rival left behind; Do but allow your pity to allay That sorrow which your love might take away. Zang. Madam, if this request successful be Then I shall need your pity more than he: I am destroy'd if this be not deny'd, For pity is to love too near ally'd. Loves wounds are safe when of your pity sure; The wounds you pity you desire to cure. Must. Your love does make you cruel when you plead Against that pity which your Friend does need. Zang. Your Love in high injustice does delight, Pleading to get your Friend's and Brother's right. Must. You have declar'd that Love no right can show But what a Mistress freely does bestow. Zang. As of the fair new world he claim'd a right Who chanc'd to have it first within his sight; So, since to me she did the first appear, I claim the right of a Discoverer. Must. The first Discov'rer only saw the shore; The second claim'd possession seeing more. In your first seeing, and then loving her, The favour of your fortune did appear, Not greatness of your love; for all, like you, Having but eyes to see, would love her too. You but the beauty of her face did find; I made the rich discovery of her mind. You of the borders of Elizium boast, Her mind is all the Inland to that Coast. I by a second voyage finding more Of beauty then was ever found before; More in it to be lov'd and worshipp'd too, Must therefore love her more then you can do. Zang. Amongst the Priests of Love there Casuists be, Who Love's Religion vex with Sophystry; But I for sacrifice bring such a heart As Nature offers in disdain of Art. Queen. Princes no more. You both but vainly strive To be possest of what I should not give; That which I should not give, you should not take, Nor prize my Love when Duty I forsake: It is in me impiety to stay. Detain not whom the dead does call away. She offers to go out, Zanger stays her. Zang. Stay, Madam. When the Clouds of grief are gone, Which cannot darken long so bright a Sun, Let Zanger in his love so happy be That none may happier prove in yours then he: If you to any others suit incline Then my Successours Love disgraces mine. This is not envy, but does rather show I prize my love because 'tis given to you. Must. True Friendship, Madam, cannot yield to this; If you reject my Love, accept of his; Next to your Love the blessing I would chuse Is that my Friend may gain what I must lose. Zang. I am amaz'd at what you seem to do; Let me not bear Loves wounds and Friendships too. Must. Only those Lovers should be counted true Who Beauties int'rest, not their own pursue; Who nobly would, when by their fortune crost, Have others get what to themselves is lost. None but the Fiends can wish Heav'n empty were Because they cannot get possession there. Zang. This gallantry does reconcile in you The utmost of revenge and friendship too; Revenge appears most sensible and high In placing favours on an Enemy. Forgive me if that style I undergo; He who a Rival is, is then a Foe. Friendship till now did ne're so high ascend As to endure a Rival in a Friend. In one bright Sphear we may together move, Whilst you excel in Friendship, I in Love. But having paid what to my Love was due, Let me discharge my debt of Friendship too. Madam, I thus would expiate my crime; That which he beg'd for me I beg for him. Tracing his steps how can I surer tread? I'le follow Vertue which I should have led. Queen. This which you Beauty call so much offends, When it does Rivals make of two such friends, That I, by drowning it, will give relief To your unequall'd Friendship and my grief. [She weeps. Zang. Against that Beauty why should you repine Which makes our Friendship with such lustre shine? Must. You wrong the world when you your beauty wrong; That and the Sun to all the world belong. Queen. My grief is greater then I should endure; I'le flye from wounds I make and cannot cure. Exit, and they gaze after her. Must. Oh, Zanger, look not after her so long! Through all her clouds her lustre is too strong. Zang. As courage of weak Towns, in their defence Against strong Armies, is held insolence, So I, resisting Fate in this assault, May make ev'n fortitude become a fault. Enter Achmat, and whispers Zanger. Achm. The Empress, Sir, commanded me to say She has prevail'd, and Mustapha shall stay. Zang. Leave us, we shall her pleasure strait attend. [Exit. Achmat. Must. What froward message does my fortune send? Zang. Sir, you are timely eas'd of half your fear. My Mother says that you shall tarry here. Since I have this procur'd you may allow Your self to think that I will keep my vow. I have in Friendship vow'd not to survive The fatal day on which you cease to live. And 'tis a work more difficult and high To help a Rival then it is to dye. Must. I know you'l keep your vow; and I some sign Have giv'n that I shall faithful prove to mine. I vow'd, if by succession I should gain Th'Imperial Scepter, you should with me reign. And since in Love's nice int'rest I comply (Whose Empire is secur'd by jealousie, And where each Lover strives to rule alone) I can admit a Rival in my Throne. [They Embrace, Exeunt. Enter Thuracus, Viche, Cleora. Viche. Ha! Will she leave the Camp? who can prepare Counsel for changes which so sudden are? Thur. My Lord, her resolution must seem strange; But, as 'tis sudden, so it soon may change: She did by me a second offer make; Urging the Empress instantly to take The keys of Buda, our revolting Town; Hoping by quitting that to keep the Crown. Viche. What was the answer which the Empress made? Thur. She summon'd all the glory that she had; Then said, she would not from the Queen receive A Present till she could a greater give. And then declar'd, her Sultan ought and must Esteem that faith which did his honour trust; That he by conquest should proceed no more; And what his glory took it should restore. Enter Cardinal, and Queen. Cleora. The Cardinal seems thoughtful, and the Queen Does feel more sorrow then she would have seen. Exeunt Thuracus, Viche, Cleora. Card. But when pursu'd will you from refuge run, And Sanctuaries shut against your Son? Your Infant, whilst from proffer'd love you flye, Must meet the hatred of your Enemy. Rustan has long your Royal house abhorr'd; And he is now to former pow'r restor'd: The storm which from the Empress he endur'd Has his foundation try'd and strength secur'd. Queen. When you the Princes proffer'd loves commend You seem to Empire, not to me, a Friend: And when your King I in his Grave forsake, I lose more love then you would have me take. Card. Be taught by Nature; she forsakes the Dead; Your precious Tears you but on ashes shed, Which now an Urn keeps sacred, but they must By wand'ring Winds be blown with common dust. Nature does turn her looks from Death's ill Face; Where ruine does not Natures strength disgrace, But by the slightness of man's Fabrick shows (Which time ev'n with a touch soon overthrows) That she made flowr's intending they should fade; And Mourners erre when Nature they upbraid. It is at once Idolatry and Pride To place on Altars what she throws aside. Love only to the living does belong: Loving the dead you all the living wrong; And both betray and lose love's int'rest when You love the dead who cannot love agen. Queen. But is there to the dead no sorrow due? Card. What useful is grows only fit for you. Grieve not for one made useless being gone; But favour those who may restore your Throne. Queen. Since both the Princes do alike pretend, VVhich to my favour will you most commend? If I must Love, and shall be taught by you. I cannot, sure, be counsell'd to love two. Card. But you may favour both, and may disguise Or shew your Love as int'rest shall advise. Queen. I cannot int'rest by such arts improve, Seeming to favour whom I do not Love: Nor with two Faces severally invite From both what I in neither can requite. Card. Yet do not both for want of loving lose; But suddenly consider which to chuse. In gaining Zanger you the Empress gain; But Mustapha must by succession reign. Queen. Each is sufficient to restore my Throne. But, whilst for Empire you are studious grown, You nothing for the other world prepare. My Lord, take Heav'n a little in your care. How can I ought of Love from Princes hear, VVho scorn those Altars where I kneel with fear? Card. They their Religion did by Conquest make; And will no Rules but from their Conqu'rors take. If they, till taught, can never truth discern They must be conquer'd to be made to learn: And since no Pow'r but Love can them subdue, Madam, they must be overcome by you, But she who will o'recome in Love's fair field Must by her yielding make her Lover yield. Queen. My Lord, your Purple Robe has study'd well. Must I this way convert an Infidel? Card. Love is perswasive and will soonest teach. Queen. They both can to the top of Empire reach, But cannot soar to our Religions height. Card. By trusting Mustapha you'l teach him Faith. Enter Cleora. Cleora. My Lord, Prince Mustapha is in your Tent. Card. Madam, my thoughts are with true duty bent To serve your Throne. Do not kind Fortune lose When she presents you two great Lotts to chuse. [Exit Cardinal. Queen. Without a Clue I'm in a lab'rynth left: And where even Hope is of her Eyes bereft. With Noble Zanger Mustapha contends, They strive as Rivals and they yield as Friends: I injure one if I the other chuse; And keeping either I the Sultan lose. Flying from both I from my refuge run; And by my staying shall destroy my Son. Them for their false Religion I eschew Though I have found their Vertue ever true. And when Religion sends my thoughts above, This Card'nal calls them down and talks of Love: And simple Love (which does as little know State-int'rest as Religion ought to do) He would, bold with Ambition lead through all The dark and crooked walks where Serpents crawl. His Priests to what he counsels gravely bow; Whilst other Priests condemn what those allow: Those would by Pious craft restore our loss; These scorn the Crescent should redeem the Cross. Zeal against Policy maintains debate; Heav'n gets the better now, and now the State. The Learned do by turns the Learn'd confute, Yet all depart unalter'd by dispute. The Priestly Office cannot be deny'd; It wears Heav'ns Liv'ry and is made our Guide. But why should we be punish'd if we stray, When all our Guides dispute which is the way?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FOURTH ACT. Enter the Queen, and Cleora. Queen. Dispatch, Cleora, lest we should be seen. Lay my disguise beneath the Couch within. You should have sent to call the Cardinal: I have forgot my Letters. Burn them all. Here, take the Key! make up my Jewels strait. You shall attend me at the Eastern Gate: But burn my Letters in the inner Tent. Cleora. I fear you will this haste too soon repent. Queen. Fortune, with thy distempers I must strive; And from a crime will not my cure derive. Those who by policy their actions steer Faint when they faults as well as losses bear; But those who on firm vertue still relie May boldly perish when they guiltless die. Cleora. 'Twere want of necessary Faith in me To think your virtue can successless be. All your commands I'le instantly obey. Queen. Our flight, Cleora, cannot brook delay; Nor can I any pause to fear allow. Enter Roxolana. Rox. You were my Guest, but are my Pris'ner now. Do you not tremble seeing me appear? Queen. None but the guilty should have sense of fear. Rox. Dismiss Cleora! we must be alone To reckon both what I and you have done. Queen. Retire! Th'intentions of my flight are all Betray'd by her, or by the Cardinal. [Exit Cleora. Rox. To make the Audit of my actions true I'le briefly take their Register from you. Did I not struggle in your Sons defence, When with no Armour but his innocence The rescue of his Crown I undertook, Whom all his Nation, being arm'd, forsook? Queen. Madam, of what you did this is the least. Rox. No Bird, new fledg'd, and frighted from his Nest, Could, more then he, be of his home berest, Or more to Natures casual mercy left. Did I not boldly his weak cause maintain Against the Vizier and the whole Divan, Though from their number I did need defence? For number has a prosp'rous impudence, Which more prevails in Courts then in the Field, Making by clamour single Fav'rites yield. And I was forc'd, when charg'd by the Divan, To my last strength, the love of Solyman. Queen. Your Enemies could not but many be, You having then all that were so to me. Rox. When, without leave, you did adventure here, And, by the right of War, my Pris'ner were, Did I not then my favours so extend That you became no Pris'ner but my Friend? When Buda you did offer to resign, Did I not constantly the gift decline, And in your cause the Sultan did implore That what his Sword had gain'd he would restore? Queen. All bounties, Madam, must to yours submit, Which nothing equals but my sense of it. Rox. Having confest my allegations true, Mark what returns has since been made by you. For more than hope of what you wisht to be, For your protection and your liberty, For all I did, and purpos'd to have done, You, in requital, have enslav'd my Son. A Son, who never yet my will controul'd Till he your fatal beauty did behold: But now, with that inchanted, is no more By his own reason rul'd, nor by my pow'r. What my designs have built, you have overthrown; And I, in Zanger's ruine, feel my own. My patience has not strength for this assault. Queen. Oh do not make my misery my fault, You now confirm all my Prophetick fears; I did employ my Reason, Pray'rs, and Tears, To make the Prince his Fatal Love decline; I knew you would resent his fault as mine: But I, alas! found my disswasions vain. Rox. Why did you not betimes to me complain? Queen. Who to a Mother could accuse a Son, Or lead you to that grief which you would shun? When I perceiv'd his Love was fixt so sure That 'twas above my Tears and Reasons cure, I did resolve in a disguise to flie Where I unknown might in a Cloister die. And, lest you might suspect what I design'd. This Letter I did mean to leave behind. [Gives her a Letter. Which begs your pardon, and informs you too My flight was but in thankfulness to you. Nor can I doubt your mercy to my Son, When I, to keep your Love, from Zanger's run. [Roxolana reads the Letter to herself. Rox. In taxing you, who now so just appear, I am more guilty then I thought you were. Nor can you your revenge more cruel make Then when you shew the guilt of my mistake. Queen. Of what is past you shew too great a sense; The reparation does exceed th'offence. Agen you'l wound me if you treat me so; I only meant my innocence to show; You, seeing that, make me obtain my end. Rox. You must my pardon seal, and be my Friend. [Kisses her. And that I may deserve what I request I'le lodge my greatest secret in your breast. I know you will be ever kind and just. [Kisses her agen. Queen. No obligation binds so much as trust. Rox. The Friendship plac'd by my unhappy Son On Mustapha, is not to you unknown. Queen. To that high Friendship I no stranger am: A nobler never yet was told by Fame. Rox. Ah Queen! from that dire friendship I receive The deepest wound which Fate did ever give. You know the bloody custom of this Crown; Nought but the Sultan's life secures my Son. For when the Eldest does the Throne enjoy, He must the Younger by our Laws destroy. Queen. That custom he by friendship will reclaim. Rox. Friendship, to Love and Pow'r, seems but a name. Though Mustapha has Virtue and Renown Fit to possess and dignifie a Crown: (For never yet did any Sultan's Son Perform and promise more than he has done) Yet when he shall th'Imperial Scepter bear He must become my Zanger's Murderer. For that is made a righteous Law by time, Which Law at first did judge the highest Crime. Queen. Pow'rs private safety is the publick good; It lives in health by letting others blood. Rox. The Sultan's love gives me a pow'r so high That I to this could give a remedy If Zanger did not secret Friendship pay, Even with Religious Rites, to Mustapha. All my designs fond Zanger does oppose, Who saving Mustapha himself will lose. Queen. Your Fate against your Vertue does conspire. Rox. Alas I must destroy what I admire. In this attempt I shall your aid implore: And, since your beauty they do both adore, You must love Mustapha, and slight my Son; Despair may do what reason should have done: For Friendship never yet could climb above The high resentments of neglected love. Queen. Madam, the weight you on my bosom lay I cannot bear, nor your commands obey. Prince Mustapha my love can never have; My King and Love are bury'd in one Grave. Rox. If Mustapha cannot your love obtain, It may suffice when you affection feign. Queen. But Honour, Madam, quickly will forget And lose it self whilst it does counterfeit; As men a little us'd to speak untrue The just remembrance lose of what they knew, Till their first shapes grow to themselves unknown. Rox. Can this be said by you who wear a Crown? When from your heart your looks do diff'rent show, Love does but change the weather of your Brow; Which should no more a constant meaning bear Then th'outward face of Heav'n should still be clear. The Great should in their Thrones mysterious be; Dissembling is no worse then mystery. Obscurity is that which terrour moves; The gods most awful seem'd in shady Groves. And our wise Prophet's Text a rev'rence bears Where it is hard and needs Interpreters. Queen. I ever was without dissembling bred, And in my open Brow my thoughts were read: None but the guilty keep themselves unkown. Rox. No wonder we so soon subdu'd your Throne; When wise Dissimulation, which should guard Chief Pow'r and make th'approaches to it hard, Was banish'd from your Court to Rebell-states, To Conclaves, Councills, and small Magistrates; These stronger grow then Monarchs who refuse The close false-Armour which their Subjects use. Queen. Madam, you teach what Christians are not taught, And seem to soar as high in flights of thought As now your Empire wide in compass swells. Rox. Sure Christian Kings live not in Courts but Cells. That is un-courtly-ill-bred innocence Which cannot with dissembled love dispence. You must dissemble love to Mustapha, And make him think by what you often say, That you for Love can mourn and languish too. Queen. Madam, I shall need counsel what to do. Rox. How, Madam? you may counsel take of me, But should from Subjects counsel still be free. We, but in asking it from Subjects, give Much more of value then we can receive. We give our secrets to them, which, when known, May make their int'rest greater then our own, By counsel men perswade or else direct; Direction like appointment we suspect: And even perswasion does the Throne invade; For slaves may govern whom they can perswade. Advise your self and boldly then proceed; Counsel must yield to courage and to speed. Queen. When I shall counsel ask, I'le none reveal; I can advise my self what to conceal. Rox. I'le press you now no farther, but retire. Madam, improve what Honour shall inspire. If that which I request may not be done You ruine me, and Zanger, and your Son. But, e're I go, assure me of your stay. Queen. In this, because I can, I will obey. [Exit Roxolana. No Fortune aims at more than she can do: She takes my Crown then tempts my Vertue too. I am for Mustapha's true love in debt, Which I will never pay with counterfeit. Enter Cardinal. Card. Madam, last night I did advise your stay; But now I come to hasten you away. Time has been active since I saw you last. Queen. Shall I trust Councils which can change so fast? Card. By various wayes we may our end pursue. Councils should alter as their causes do. Physicians, Madam, will not think it strange If I change Med'cines when Diseases change. The Pilot, of most firm and constant mind, Must shift his course and turn with ev'ry wind. Enter Thuracus, Viche. Thur. The Sultan's Troops, more swift then in Alarms, Are, without orders, running to their Arms. Viche. Rustan does now in sev'ral shapes appear; For he is often alter'd by his fear. Card. The Army is so bent to Mutiny That Mustapha does counsel you to flye. Madam, we all are to your flight inclin'd. Queen. But, to this place, my Lord, I am confin'd; And by a tye which has such influence That I will rather dye then flye from hence. A Mutinous noise is heard. Card. Their anger is grown loud! Madam, 'tis fit That you send out to know the cause of it. Queen. Make haste my Lords, and sev'rally inquire If those who rais'd this storm can raise it higher; And when you have the danger of it learn'd Observe how far the Princes are concern'd. [Exeunt Thuricus, Viche. Enter Cleora at another door, and whispers the Queen. Cleor. Zarma has hastily a whisper brought Which says, that means for your escape is wrought. This Tempest Mustapha would have you shun; And she will help to send away your Son. Queen. O how am I perplext? secure him Heav'n! [Aside. I have my Faith to Roxolana given T'assure her of my stay, by which my Son May in my Fortunes equal hazard run. [Whispers Cleora. Go strait to Roxolana's Tent, and there Observe what change does in her looks appear. [Exit Cleora. Card. Madam, you said you would not flye from hence: 'Tis a resolve of fatal consequence. Queen. The cause of that resolve I must conceal; But will a secret of more use reveal. The Prince has by his Presents Zarma won, Who will contrive to send away my Son. This is a bus'ness worthy your debate. Card. Unhappy is the Minister of State Whom for successless counsel you despise Yet that conceal by which he should advise. His fate and not his skill you ought to blame Who plays the Cards yet must not see the Game. If I but hold the Cards which you will play, I throw your judgment not my own away. Queen. But this which needs your counsel open lies. Card. To what you have reveal'd I thus advise. Your Son, to Buda flying, will redeem By his own loss those who abandon'd him, You trust the Conquer'd who were false before And by distrust provoke the Conquerour. How can your Son by flight advantag'd be Who quits the Port to meet a storm at Sea? And doubtless, Madam, you by staying here The whole revenge of his escape must bear. These are the dangers which attend his flight; But he is safe in Roxolana's sight. For, till her growing pow'r you can suspect, Doubt not his safety whom she does protect. Queen. Your reasons urging his continuance here, Like Rays of light, are sudden, strong, and clear. My Lord, as these convince me for his stay So let my counsel hasten you away. The Mutinous, who now in tumult rise, Hate our Religion, and your Robe despise. This storm you may in Buda safely see. Card. Madam, it will no more my wonder be That you, not trusting me, disguis'd appear Since you suspect I am so faint with fear As to forsake my Queen in her distress. But, Madam, walk in Clouds and trust me less: Though but in part your mind you will declare Yet in your whole misfortunes I will share: And though my counsels may defective seem I'le by my suff'rings merit your esteem. [Exit. Queen. Our greatest Counc'lours think we are unjust VVhen our least thoughts are hidden from their trust; And till (by knowing th'utmost that we know) Those restless Counc'lours may our Rulers grow, They do not love us, and they sullen seem; But after care not though we love not them. [Exit. Enter Solyman, Rustan, Pyrrhus. Shouts are heard from within. Soly. What Shouts are these? Rust. Shouts which your Souldiers pay, Hearing Prince Mustapha has leave to stay. Pyrrh. About his Tents the joyful Souldiers crowd. Soly. There was no need their joy should be so loud. Their shouts of Triumph never rose so high. Rust. It shews they love him more than Victory. And when these shouts they in your presence make It is a sign they love him for your sake. Soly. How long can they the Father love, who run VVith such a guilty kindness to the Son? 'Tis much to do it, more to show it so. Pyrrh. Men never fear to pay the debts they owe. Soly. He takes that love which does belong to me, And lets me reign but by his courtesie: His early acquisition shews his skill In ruling, and his pow'r declares his will. Rust. Suspicion's good unless it start too soon And then does faster then th'offender run. If he pursues, too early and too fast, Your Armies love, he errs but in his haste. Your jealousie and his desire to gain That love from which he should a while abstain, May be excus'd; for neither is a crime But as you both may erre in point of time. Pyrrh. Why should your Armies kindness be his fault? Soly. They love or hate but so as they are taught. By fear Usurpers should their pow'r sustain; But a true Prince chiefly by love should reign. Whilst, in loose knots, fear but the body binds, We strongly rule by love our Subjects minds. Rust. Yet wisest Monarchs by success have prov'd That it is safer to be fear'd than lov'd. For Subjects as they please, their love dispense, But alwayes fear as it does please the Prince. A King should more the ruling pow'r esteem Plac'd in himself then when 'tis lodg'd in them. Soly. That errour is destructive to a state: For whom soe're the people fear they hate. This is in me and in my Subjects true: For fearing Mustapha I hate him too. And he, even in my Camp, my pow'r controuls; I ruling but their Bodies, he their Souls. Pyrrh. By his first deeds he seem'd to study you; And of your story a fair Copy drew. Can he deface the Virtue he has shown And on his fathers Ruine build his Throne? Soly. Since on Ambition's wings he means to rise He will both hate and slight all Natures Ties. A Fathers name cannot his Nature fright From Glory when it does his youth invite. Th'inchanting sound of Pow'r so Charms his Ear, That he will now no other Musick hear. New shouts are heard, at which Solyman starts. This insolence is loud enough to wake Revenge from duller sleep then death can make. Rust. Perhaps not understanding their offence, They deem this duty which is insolence. And think they not offend in what they do. Soly. My Army then is bravely taught by you. Can any ignorant of Treason be Who shout for ought but victory and me? Rust. Yet do not, Sir, decline what I advise. Repentance is a noble Sacrifice. But if, when taught, their crime they should pursue, 'Twill justifie what you intend to do. Pyrrh. When but a few into offences run, Justice may safely punish what is done. But when whole Camps are kindled to a flame, Perswasion then, not force, must them reclaim. Rustan. Revenge, which to the injur'd does belong, Can be successful only to the strong. Your Foes you summon e're their Towns you storm: If to your Army now you less perform They all in Arms for Mustapha will rise Because you use them worse then Enemies. Soly. I yield to your advice, go both, and try To make them in their joys more mannerly. [Exeunt Rustan, Pyrrhus. My race of Glory did proceed too fast. My Armies now grow weary of my haste. And yet, though tir'd, they shout and gladly run To see me over-taken by my Son: All in this Race are stopt when overtook; And I, whom all did follow, am forsook: Forsook by him whom I begot and bred: I'm left behind by those whom I have led. Must I, like Conqu'ring Fleets, when storms begin, Take all my glorious Flags and Streamers in? Though Mustapha by Heavens decree was sent To warn great Monarchs by my punishment Yet he does Heav'n offend, offending me. What means our Prophet by this mistery? My Son's ordain'd to what he should not do And I to bear what I should punish too. [Exit. Enter Mustapha, Zanger. Mustapha seems very pensive. Zang. Ah Prince! you wrong your love whilst you admit Another Passion thus to reign with it. Must. Zanger, my grief may well my heart subdue Since 'tis too great to be reveal'd to you. Pity that Fate with which I now contend; It makes me hide my danger from my Friend. Zang. What can you seem unwilling to declare, After confessing you my Rival are? Or of that Friendship are you not secure Which did, unshaken, such a proof endure? Must. Let what I heard be silenc'd as untrue, Since my believing it may trouble you: And yet my speaking it may pardon'd be Since your not hearing it may ruine me. Zang. What can I more an injury esteem Then when by silence you distrustful seem? Must. Alas! you know not that you are unjust VVhen thus you take my kindness for distrust. Be loth to hear what I shall speak with pain. Zang. I torment feel in that which you retain. Must. Your Mother with the Vizier is agreed: And she hath secretly my death decreed. Zang. You wrong me, Brother, and your self deceive: And I wrong nature when I this believe. Must. I'le rather perish by your mis-belief Then give you evidence t'increase your grief. Farewel! the duty of a Son retain. You'l hear your Brother, and your Friend is slain. Zang. 'Twere cruel, Sir, to leave me with this wound. Must. You are too good to see what I have found. [Going out. Zang. Stay, Sir, I cannot nature much offend, Doubting a Mother to preserve a Friend. Our Friendship does the minds allyance show. Let me the utmost of this secret know. Must. It comes from one who does not prudence lack, Nor his intelligence from Rumour take; One to whom Zarma does with trust disclose (Charm'd by his love) all that her bosom knows. This bloody mischief is with art design'd, The secret, cautiously, to few confin'd; Which by such close contraction is made strong, And still you Mother abler to do wrong. Zang. Perhaps she is thus cruel since I grow As cruel in believing she is so. Yet then she with her self does dis-agree, Knowing I die in you and she in me. Must. This Junto could not so successful be Were not the Sultan wrought to jealousie That I, affecting popular esteem, Follow those Crouds which have forsaken him; And that I aim'd not, by my Battels won, To conquer Persia but usurp his Throne. These false suggestions I might soon remove Were I admitted to implore his Love; But oh that rigid form which us bereaves Of all approach without our Father's leaves! That rigid custom which does bring no less Then death when we, unsent for, seek access! But, Zanger, if I could admittance gain, I must not where your Mother rules complain. Zang. If they have rais'd the Sultan's wrath so high, You must, to save your life, vouchsafe to flie. Your stay makes life depend upon his breath; Your flight prevents his guilt and your own death. Whom he suspects he does but seldom save; A Princes Prison is a Princes Grave. Must. 'Twere better, Zanger, that my blood were spilt Then sav'd by Flight; Flight is it self a guilt. Since still my duty did my actions steer I'le not disgrace my innocence by fear, Left I the saving of my life repent. I'le rather bear then merit punishment. Zang. When Pris'ner made 'twill be a new offence T'accuse his wrath by pleading innocence. Your death he'l then decree t'avoid complaint; Pow'r oft by death does justifie restraint: And, when incens'd, into two faults will run Rather then own that it has acted one. We shall by your retreat gain time to learn Those dangers which our haste cannot discern. You then may make that innocence appear Which yet his passion will not let him hear. Must. I'le sooner yield my person to his pow'r Then be held guilty by him but one hour. By flight my fear and shame will equal be; And fear or shame is worse then death to me. Zang. I doubt your vertue will your life betray; But since so nobly you resolve to stay, I'le to my Mother strait, and she shall know Th'important secret of our mutual vow. It will divert the hope of her design, When she's assur'd your ruine must be mine. Must. Friendship like this who ever did enjoy, Which Rival'd-love nor death cannot destroy? Oh Zanger! If you knew how much I strove To make my Friendship overcome my Love (Though in that strife I could not Victor be) You would both envy then and pity me. Zang. I'm glad in that design you mist your end: Who quits his Mistress may forsake his Friend. And none of Friendship should a proof admit Which may occasion fear of losing it. For he who can break off your Conqu'rours chain Has such wild strength as nothing can restrain. Must. Hah! stay! methinks I'm on a sudden brought To light's last glimps, and to a stop of thought! Methinks, something prophetick in my Breast Bids me make haste and in Fame's Temple rest. And as men dying leave chief Legacies To those whose Friendship they did dearest prize, So, Zanger, I, as to your merit due, Bequeath the Queen, my life's last gift, to you. Zang. Our secret Sympathy your Fate secures: If bad, my Breast would feel't as soon as yours. And since you but bequeath a Legacy, Which cannot be possest before you dye, You safely give what I shall ne're receive Because I cannot Mustapha out-live. Must. How poorly some in Friendship take a pride Which never yet was by Love's int'rest try'd: To ours alone the perfect praise is due At once of being Friends and Rivals too. [Exeunt Embracing. Enter Rustan, Pirrhus. Pirrh. Complyance now must serve us more then force Since th'European and the Asian Horse Refuse our orders and in publick say That we conspir'd to banish Mustapha. Rust. No pride so dang'rous is as being proud Of prosp'rous Mutiny. They threaten loud Who us'd but in their whispers to complain. Pirrh. If they the Fanizaries Aga gain We are, beyond repairs of Court, undone. Rust. The force we dare not meet we ought to shun. Pirrh. The Empress feels remorse, or finds her fear. Rust. We shall be call'd, Zarma expects us here. Enter Achmat, Haly. Achmat, and Asian Horse have long been led By you, and by your great example bred. This Monster-mutiny will all devour. You might oblidge the Sultan with your pow'r If you could quell this Monster. Ach. May be so. But you had better trye what you can do. Rust. The deed is noble and belongs to you: I would not take what is to Achmat due. Ach. Indeed you ever, with a tender hand, Touch'd what another Bassa should command. Your Justice (which knows when, and whom to strike) Usurps no business which you do not like. Pirrh. Haly, this doubtful language strange appears. Haly. You'l in the Army find Interpreters. Rust. Haly it seems does listen to the Crowd. Haly. Men need not listen where Complaints are loud. Pirrh. The people rail to exercise their Tongues. Haly. Their patience first is exercis'd with wrongs. Pirrh. They, wanting judgment, should submit to Laws, And cannot Judges be in their own cause, But to their Rulers gently should appeal. Ach. Men their own judges are of what they feel. Rust. This is not meant in Friendship nor for sport. Sure, Pirrhus, they are angry with the Court, And having found, none for their anger care, Strive out of malice to be popular. Enter Zarma who whispers Rustan. Zarma. You must bring Pyrrhus, and may have access. Exeunt with Zarma, Rustan and Pirrhus, smiling scornfully on the other two, and they on them. Achm. Methinks we were ill-natur'd to express So much contempt of Greatness in distress. Haly. When shining Fav'rites grow with greatness proud All men rejoyce to see them in a Cloud. If this ill nature be, 'tis not confin'd To us alone, but is in all mankind. And whilst we blame our selves we injure all: Nothing's ill natur'd that is natural. Achm. I must confess, in thus insulting, you Do but as States-men to each other do. Haly. When they are more afflicted we will seem To mourn with their few Friends who pity them; But secretly we will their Foes insence And then, in haste, bring them intelligence Of mischiefs which they never can avoid; And so be thankt by those we have destroy'd. [Exeunt. Enter Roxolana, Rustan, Pyrrhus. Rox. My favour to the Sultan you implore Only for Governments you sought before. You sue for Egypt, you for Babylon; If I could these procure you would be gone. Rust. In these from sudden Foes we distant are; No Mutiny can last to march so far: And we, by absence, may perhaps abate The rage contracted by this Armies hate. Pirrh. This Armies temper, well consider'd, shows You are not safe when we our safety lose. But 'twill in vain with your designs contest When in our hands you shall possess the East. Rox. Men who to high designs, like this, are bent Should less fear death then not to see th'event. Rust. The Camp to Mustapha such love has shown That we shall hasten by his death our own. Pirrh. That which does lead your hope the surest way Brings us to certain ruine if we stay. Rox. You vow'd (striving my favour to regain) That Zanger after Solyman should reign, And, that I might no mark of horrour bear, You said, I still against it should appear. Pirrh. But, Madam, neither of us promis'd we The Princes Executioners would be. All but the Mutes will that black office shun; And all things else are near perfection done. Rox. None here the fatal Orders will obey, If in this juncture you should flye away. You both must stay, and what you plotted, act I'le not the guilt of your designs contract. Rust. In staying we the Princes fate partake; We who are guilty only for your sake. So guilty none did ever yet appear. Rox. You only guilty are because you fear: But fear in States-men is the highest crime. Those who to Empires upper stations climbe Are not so useful by their being wise As they may hurtful be by cowardise. For they, fearing to act what they should do, Make with themselves the valiant useless too. Rust. Provoke not those who with your ruine may Save both themselves and injur'd Mustapha. Pirrh. This, were we Cowards, we could quickly do. Rox. Am I forsaken, and then threatn'd too? You doing this will your best visage wear. Falshood in States-men is less vile then fear. Go to the Sultan, go! and th'int'rest try Of crafty Art: On Nature I'le rely. You are whole States-men and his Friends in part; States-men, like States, are but the works of Art. When in both shapes your wisdoms have appear'd, Weak Wives and Mistresses may chance be heard. You with your blood must for your mischiefs pay; But a few tears will wash my guilt away. What you design'd, Ambition made you do; I did but that which Nature call'd me to. You did the Plot contrive to kill his Son; At which I but conniv'd to save my own. Go then, and by your deaths the diff'rence prove Twixt those whom Kings but trust, and whom they love. Rust. Our Treason against you would be a fault Greater then ever enter'd in our thought. Pardon our Passion since you did deny The sute we made with sharpest injury. Pirrh. Too much your loyal servants you despise When you their care impute to Cowardise. Rox. Care does unworthy of it self appear When it the ugly vizard wears of Fear. If, as you said, the deed is almost done, Stay but one day to end what you begun. The Souldiers fury, which you would decline, If well improv'd will perfect your design. Their love to Mustapha is turn'd to rage; Which nothing but his blood can now asswage. Go then and make my Son the Empires Heir; Leave your preferments to my sudden care. Rust. We in your cause all dangers will despise. Pyrrh. And with your fortune quickly fall or rise. Rust. We will the Sultan instantly attend: The Princes ling'ring Fate in death shall end. [Exeunt Rustan, Pyrrhus. Enter Zarma. Zarma. Madam, Prince Zanger, much impatient, stays Within, and humbly for admittance prays. Rox. I guess the bus'ness which has brought him here: His fatal Friendship gives me grief and fear: Finding the Sultan does his Brother hate He would employ me as his Advocate. Say I am close at my Devotion, go! Say I'm retir'd; make haste and tell him so. Admit him not though much he will pretend. Zarma. He is too much a Brother and a Friend. [Aside. [Exit Zarma. Rox. What sin of mine, oh Heaven! incenses thee? Thou mak'st my Son his own worst Enemy. What by my care and Art he might enjoy He does himself contribute to destroy. And I, in my perplext condition, must Become unnatural, or else unjust: Must leave a Son to Empires cruelty, Or to a gen'rous Prince inhumane be. My Husband, whom I Love, I cruel make, Even against Nature, yet for Natures sake. His Son, by my contrivance, he must kill; Whilst I preserve my own against his will. The blood I save must answer for my guilt And wash away the stains of what is spilt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE FIFTH ACT. Enter Solyman, Roxolana, Pyrrhus, Rustan. Soly. I will not stay to see him in my Throne: I yet can reach him and will take him down, Rustan has now my orders: he shall die. Rox. Excess of Justice turns to cruelty. Soly. Whilst but suspition did my breast invade Your mediation could my wrath disswade; But now his Treason is so certain grown That I must take his life, or lose my own. The name of Mustapha infects your breath. Those who desire his life, design my death. Rox. Then, Sir, my intercession is unfit. Yet pardon me if I with grief submit; For it does too much cause of grief afford, When Justice against Nature draws her Sword. Soly. His death is but deferr'd, because I stay To send him to his Grave the safest way. Rust. Since you by Achmat did the Prince advise That if he either loyal were or wise He from the Camp should secretly retire, And by his absence quench his raging fire. It were convenient to you Achmat sent With kindness to invite him to your Tent; Pretending 'tis your will he should receive Your counsel e're he does the Army leave. But, Sir, since for your safety he must die It should be done with speed and secrefie. Pyrrh. Else they may rescue him by open force. His Train and Guards are Thirty Thousand Horse: And he so much your Souldiers rules that they Will scarce, but in your presence, you obey. Soly. Already his dark evening is begun: He shall be sure to set before the Sun; And never more shall rise to be ador'd, But part in an Eclipse and be abhorr'd. Send Achmat hither to avoid delay. [Exeunt Rustan, Pyrrhus. Rox. Fate rises in your Brow! I dare not stay To hear the bloody sentence you must give: Horrour and pity in my bosome strive, Remembring what to Mustapha is due, And not to punish him would ruine you. [Exit. Soly. We our compassion rather should extend To strangers than to Sons when they offend: With wrongs from strangers we may well dispence Who nothing have receiv'd to recompence: They onely are by common justice bound: None are ingrate who have no favour found. But Mustapha (unthankful for that care Which bred him to deserve the Wreaths of War; Whom all the Bonds of Nature could not tie) Shall now, for Natures sake, unpity'd die. [Exit. Enter Mustapha, Zanger. Must. This counsel Achmat from the Sultan brought, Whose favour I have now by Achmat sought; Begging I may attend him e're I go, And fully my suppos'd offences know. If to this just request he does consent, I may avoid my fatal Banishment, And be deliver'd from a double grief Whilst I to Love and Friendship give relief. Zang. I fear in your request by Achmas made You have but sought the means to be betray'd. And since against your self you now conspire Who will oppose that Fate which you desire? My Mother, in denying me access, Does rashly your determin'd death confess. Must. Since only guilty minds have cause of fear It does to me more probably appear That even my Foes are likeli'er to abhor Their mischiefs past then to consult of more. Enter Achmat. Achm. The joys of conquest ever fill your breast. The Mighty Sultan yields to your request; Believes your love is in your message sent; He trusts that love, and thinks you innocent. His Cloud is vanish'd and his Brow so clear That you may plainly read a Father there: Sir, he does straight expect you in his Tent: Improve his kindness whilst he does relent. Must. How like you now the way I did pursue? [To Zanger. Zang. I think the change too sudden to be true. Must. If false, I then am but of life bereav'd: 'Tis worth my dying to be undeceiv'd. And who would with a Father be in strife? Rather then duty lose I'le lose my life. Zanger, farewel! I leave, in leaving you, The best of Friends and best of Brothers too. Yet I shall take some glory in my death Counting the worth of what I can bequeath. And, to confirm my Legacy, I now Freely release the rigour of your vow. For if in th'upper world we ought can know Of things which those we love transact below, I shall rejoyce when I am thither gone, That you possess my Mistriss and my Throne. Zang. Can you such gifts to one so worthless give As after you will be content to live? Ah Prince! If this discourse you should pursue, Sorrow to me would kinder prove then you. Must. If in my Fate, Dear Zanger, you should share. Who of the Queens concerns will take a care? Think it her sute, not mine, which you deny. Zang. When you are dead, Honour will make me die. Must. I shall be strong enough for my defence, Where nature pleads the cause of innocence. Zang. Methinks both these should all things overcome; Yet Hope finds in my breast but little room. Must. I must not your Prophetick sorrows hear: 'Tis only Friendship which creates your fear. [Exeunt. Enter the Queen, Zarma. Zarma. One whom I lov'd enjoyn'd me to obey, With faithful service, you and Mustapha, And, Madam, I attend you now you are Alone that all I know I may declare. Queen. I'le not ungrateful be for what you do: I'le serve you in rewards and Friendship too. Zarma. I still have fear'd that Roxolana's love To Zanger would his Brothers ruine prove; But many proofs do now my thoughts convince That she designs to save and serve the Prince: For that effect she's to the Sultan gone; But first commanded me to tell her Son That he this evening in her Tent should stay To speak with her concerning Mustapha. The tumult in the Camp begins to cease, And all put on the chearful looks of Peace. Queen. You tell me what I most desir'd to hear: Which soon will free me from my grief and fear. Zarma. Since all things move to meet with your desire Your Son has no occasion to retire. Queen. By your advice I may successful grow. Zarma. Still what I hear you instantly shall know. [Exit Zarma. Enter Cardinal, Thuracus, Viche, Cleora. Queen. My Lords, by Zarma (who is newly gone) I hear the Sultan smiles upon his Son: The Empress nobly has procur'd his peace: The Chiefs of factions from their tumults cease, And now for favour to her Tent resort. Card. I doubt all this is but a turn of Court. Think not the Empress will her pow'r employ T'establish him who must her Son destroy. Queen. Honour has in her Soul the highest place. Card. Nature has greater pow'r then Honour has. But, Madam, whilst this seeming calm does last You, with the Infant, should to Buda haste; Which, now disloyal grown, will scarce with stand The worst of all your Foes, King Ferdinand. For whilst the Turk invades us from the East, Th'un-christian King assaults us in the West. With craft and wealth he has advan'd his pow'r. Thur. Madam, we now came from the Governour; Who bad us tell you that he has surpriz'd Three of King Ferd'nand's Officers disguis'd. Viche. With these there have been blank Commissions found: Some of their faction we in Fetters bound. Queen. Before this danger does resistless grow You must, with both these Lords, to Buda go. Card. Your presence, Madam, will be needful there. Queen. My promise will a while detain me here. Card. You'l then be left afflicted and alone. Queen. You leave me for my safety not your own. Whilst I the rage of fortune here withstand We may be ruin'd there by Ferdinand. I must not be deny'd. Your being there Will free me from a most important care. Card. Madam, my strict obedience makes me go. All that does happen you shall hourly know. [Exeunt Queen and Cleora one way, the Cardinal and Lords at the other door. Enter Mustapha. The Guards and others, passing by him, shake their heads with sorrowful looks. Must. All shake their pensive heads in passing by As if they did dislike my destiny. Let him dispatch whom he intends to kill: 'Tis less to suffer death then fear it still. Nor is the worst of deaths so bad a Fate As still to live under a Fathers hate. My torments are so many and so high That only death can be my remedy. Death will my Fathers jealousie remove And free me ever from neglected love; Whilst to my greatest guilt it puts an end Of being Rival to so brave a Friend. But even that comfort brings me sorrow too; For death will then more then my Friendship do. And if his kindness makes him keep his vow He, dying, will the greater Friendship show. He'l freely, for my sake, quitt life and love; But cruel force does me from both remove. In death his friendship will so clearly shine That when I dye, he'l see the faults of mine: For I, by Rivalship, was faulty grown And death resigns what friendship should have done. Enter six Mutes, one of them advances before the rest and kneels down, delivers Mustapha a black Box with a Parchment, the Sultan's Great Seal hanging at it in a black Ribbond. Then he holds up a Bow-string and makes signs that he should kneel and submit to the Sultan's sentence. These are to adde new wings to my last hour. I understand your signs and see your power. Stand off. I with your bus'ness can dispence. But your officious hast is an offence. I will consider what I ought to do, And dye to satisfie my self, not you. They retire to the further end of the Stage. Can I my duty show when I do ill, Unjustly yielding to a Fathers will? Sure we, by Natures gift, the right enjoy To strive with those who would our lives destroy. And when I tamely dye, without defence, I teach the world to doubt my innocence. But with my Father why should I debate? My death he wishes and my life I hate. Why should I make his anger higher rise By striving to preserve what I despise? [He beckens to the Mutes to come near him, and they advance. Before I dye I'le to the Sultan show My injur'd innocence, that he may know My death will to the judging world proclaim He is more guilty then he thinks I am. When I have told him what I ought to say, Then what he does command I will obey.â [They all shake their heads in sign of denyal. How, Slaves? am I refus'd? I will not dye Till I have first obtain'd what you deny. [The Mutes draw their Scemitars and assault him; he draws too and Kills two of them. Enter Solyman. Soly. O Traytor! art thou such an Enemy To thy high Blood, which is deriv'd from me, That now, enforc'd by this new crime, I must With my own hand mix it with common dust? Against my pow'r thou dying art at strife, To make thy death as guilty as thy life. At the first hearing of Solyman's voice the Mates give over sighting, and at the end of Solyman's speech, Mustapha, kneeling, lays his Scemitar at the Sultan's feet. Must. The cause of my defence from their assault Was that from you I might have learnt my fault. Alas, what i'st I with that life should do Which, Sir, is hated and proscrib'd by you? All I endeavour'd by my life's defence Was to gain time to shew my innocence. I shun not dying, Sir, but to be held Guilty, is dying after I am kill'd, Losing the life of Fame when I am dead. Soly. A man condemn'd is not allow'd to plead. I'le hear no more. [Mustapha rises. Must. Then, Sir, to death I'le go. I am too guilty since you think me so. May not my servants do what must be done? Let not your meanest Slaves destroy your Son. Soly. Though justice takes that life which he must lose [Aside. Yet Nature cannot this request refuse. Go, lead him in, and let his Servants do [To the Mutes. That sudden justice which I left to you. Must. That cheerfulness with which to death I go Some proof; Sir, of my innocence does show. And since by death I would your hate remove What would I not have done to gain your love? [Exeunt Mustapha, and Mutes, Solyman looking after Mustapha whilst he is in sight. Soly. What I have now decreed does just appear: But against Nature who can stop his Ear Though she against the right of Justice stands? My Heart does sigh for what my Tongue commands. [Exit. Enter Roxolana. Rox. Now the great deed is doing, or else done, I have been cruel to preserve my Son. That cruel deed which makes him th'Empires Heir Heav'n, sure, forgives since it rewards my care. And nothing now can ever make me grieve But for his death by which my Son does live. Enter Zarma. Zarma. Madam, the Guards are doubled ev'ry where. Rox. If Guards can make you safe what need you fear? Zarma. Your servants hide their looks, and fear to show The griefs they feel, and dangers which they know. Rox. Zarma, be deaf to what you should not hear; Or use your strength to what you ought to bear. Easing your self, when you of grief complain, To many others you transfer your pain. [Enter Haly Weeping. By your amazement and the tears you shed, [To Haly. You seem to tell me Mustapha is dead. Haly. Yes, and so dy'd, that the most fortunate Would gladly for his Fame have had his Fate. But, Madam, be suffic'd that he is dead. Rox. No, I dare hear both what he did and said. Haly. The Sultan his last suit could not deny; Which was, that by his servants he might dye. And each of those declar'd it a less crime To kill himself then 'twas to Murder him. Rox. It shews he was with highest love esteem'd When none would kill whom Solyman condemn'd. Haly. It turn'd our blood to tears when he did pray To all, in vain, to take his life away. He said aloud, can I so wretched prove That your denyals must declare your love? See what your guilty kindness drives me to; Worse then my Father did, 'twill make me do. One, whom he guilty thought, to death he sent; But you will make me kill the innocent. 'Tis you have made your Prince unfortunate, Who finds your love more cruel then his hate. And now (afraid of nothing but delay) He frowning said, unfriended Mustapha Must be beholding to himself for death: Then snatcht a Sword which straight he did unsheath. Morat cry'd out, the Murd'rer's part I'le do; 'Tis fitter I should bear that guilt then you. The Prince about his neck his Arms did spread In sign of gratitude, and smiling said, Is it not fit my wretched life should end When he who kills me I esteem my Friend? Rox. He could not give more ornament to death Then when so calmly he resign'd his breath. Haly. When griev'd Morat the fatal deed had done (Which kindness made him do and others shun) With haste he said, no Tears can be so good To shed for such a loss as Tears of blood. His hand then acts the second Tragick part So on his own, as on his Masters heart. But grief had wounded him so much before, That scarce his Cemiter could wound him more. Rox. This was at once a duty and a crime. Haly. It made us pity first, then envy him. Rox. Call Zanger hither and return with speed. But keep him ignorant of this dire deed. [Exit Haly. Brave Prince, if now thy Mother were alive, She, by my sorrow, might be taught to grieve. How soon thy death a miracle has done? It makes me weep for what preserves my Son. [Exeunt Roxolana, Zarma. Enter Solyman. Soly. Forgot are now those Fields his Valour won, Which did too soon his Head with Laurel crown! His Virtue with his Foes he overthrew; For, growing great, he straight grew guilty too. Enter Zanger, who kneels; Solyman steps to him; and takes him up. Zang. I come at your command, by Achmat sent; Who said, I should attend you in your Tent. Soly. Zanger, I, how did for your judgement send: You are my minds Physician, Son, and Friend. Tell me, can Mortal-Monarchs alwaies keep The watch o're Empire set without some sleep? Zang. No man can live whom sleep does not repair; Much less can Monarchs who are born to care. Soly. Behold then the revenge which I did take On him who kept me many Months awake. Zang. My Brother dead? you have the world bereft Of much more Virtue then is in it left! 'Twas Jealousie, not he (Oh dire mistake!) Which did so many Months keep you awake; And it was just that you, who in your Breast Would jealousie admit should take no rest. My speech is by this object overcome: No grief is well exprest till it is dumb! Zanger goes towards Mustapha. Ah Loyal Prince! till death does close my Eyes, Accept these Tears, my Friendships Sacrifice! Soly. Traytor, dost weep for one condemn'd by me? This shews that thou as guilty art as he. Desist, or thou shalt share in his just fate. Zang. That, Sir, will rather shew your love than hate. Death is the only blessing I can find: You think it just, and I shall think it kind. I will his worth to all the world declare. Soly. He did aspire and grew too popular. Zang. Rustan, and Pyrrhus did his life pursue: We their contrivance of this Murder knew: And I desir'd him from your wrath to flie; But in obedience he would stay to die. For, but one day when banish'd from your sight, VVas worse to him than Death's eternal night. If in himself he any guilt had known, He, with your leave, to Syria might have gone. He told me still what he design'd or knew. Soly. His black designs he did conceal from you. Zang. Nothing could more his trust of Friendship prove Then that we both th'Hungarian Queen did love: And though he then my first pretensions knew, Yet freely he confest he lov'd her too: And when a Rival does his love reveal, What can his cunning after that conceal? How could you his unblemisht Vertue doubt? Soly. Have I not often heard my Armies shout When he appear'd, and with applause so high As if his presence brought them Victory? Zang. In that their errour and not his appear'd; He with more grief then you their gladness heard. By all the duty to a Father due, And to our Prophet, Mustapha was true; True as you Viziers have been false and wrought You into wrong suggestions of his fault. Soly. Oh Heaven! my guilt now makes it an offence To hear untimely of his innocence. This truth (which now I may my torment call) You should have sooner told, or not at all. Zang. Who could, without offending you, have thought (When your kind message was by Achmat brought) That 'twas a train laid for my Brothers life? And yet my doubt with duty was at strife; And doubt prevail'd, for sev'ral waies I try'd To get admittance but was still deny'd. Soly. Zanger, to ease our griefs, let us agree T'impute his Fate to our ill destinie. Those who to death have made me send my Son, Shall instantly in torture meet their own. Let wisdom check your sorrow, and prepare To be this day proclaim'd my Empire's Heir. Zang. But, Sir, religiously to me he swore That, if the Turkish Crown he ever wore, He to our bloody Law an end would give, And I should safely in his bosome live. My self I then by sacred promise ty'd Not to out-live the day on which he dy'd. And as I knew he nobly did design To keep his vow, so I remember mine. [He turns to Mustapha. 'Twas only love had strength enough t'invade That mutual Friendship which we sacred made: But now o're love I have the conquest got; Though Love divided us, yet death shall not.â [Zanger stabs himself and falls at Mustapha's Feet, Solyman runs to him. Soly. Hold, Zanger! hold! Zang. The happy wound is given Which sends my Soul to Mustapha and Heaven. Soly. Friendship and cruelty alike have done; For each of them has rob'd me of a Son. Zang. When, Sir, you have forgiv'n me for my death, Grant what I ask with my departing breath: Your dying Zanger begs th'Hungarian Crown For th'injur'd Queen and for her guiltless Son. Soly. Shall I so little give for Zanger's sake, Whose mighty mind would not my Empire take? Zang. Sir, for your gift in thankfulness I bend; [Bows to him. In death I serve my Mistress and my Friend. He'l live in your esteem, she in her Throne. Now all I had to do on Earth is done. [Turns again to Mustapha. Lo at your Feet, dear Friend, your Brother lies; And where he took delight to liveâhe dies. [Zanger dies. Soly. Fame in her Temple will adorn thy shrine. No Roman Glory ever equall'd thine. Zanger, in height of Youth, for Friendships sake, Did rather die then proffer'd Empire take. I would die too, but by revenge am staid Due for you both, which shall be doubly paid. My Viziers shall be first your sacrifice. Nor is she safe who in my bosom lies. For they, without her int'rest in the deed, Durst not at last have urg'd me to proceed. Turns to Mustapha. Oh Mustapha! the worthy may in thee The dang'rous state even of great vertue see. Thine was to all the height and compass grown That vertue e're could reach to get renown: And the reward of it pernicious prov'd, For I did punish thee for being lov'd. Thy Mother was the first that e're possest By Conquest the Dominion of my Breast: And had thy mind been blotted and as black As vertue would paint vice, yet for her sake, (The brightest Beauty, and the softest Wife) I might, alas, at least have sav'd thy life. But I shall mourn too long; for whilst I stay, To count thy wrongs, I thy revenge delay. [Exit. Enter Roxolana, Haly. Rox. How Haly! are you certain that my Son Is to the Sultan's Great Pavilion gone? Haly. Achmat was for him by the Sultan sent; And you will find him in the inner Tent. Rox. You should have brought him to consult with me E're he had known his Brothers destinie. Haly. I humbly beg, this may be rather thought Your servants great misfortune then his fault. Rox. Wait in my name, on the Hungarian Queen: Tell her, that those rude Tumults she has seen May still increase, and may nenew her fear; And therefore I would fain secure her here. But something, from your self, you ought to say, She having heard too much of Mustapha. [Exit Haly. Roxolana goes towards the Scene, where she sees Mustapha, and Zanger with his Dagger in his hand, and then she starts back. Both dead! O horrour! Zanger does appear Arm'd 'gainst himself as his own Murderer. This deed Friendship and pity made thee do. But was not I thy Friend and Mother too? That Friendship against Nature was a crime Which paid me nothing and too much to him. Though Friendship to a Friend thou might'st assign, Yet, since I lent thee life, that life was mine. Unjust to Nature, though to Friendship true, In paying Friendships debt with Natures due. Is this the last reward of all the pain I felt, saving thy life to make thee reign? Thou hast reveng'd (O Heav'n) what I have done With so much guilty kindness for my Son! Enter the Queen. Queen. What voice of sorrow is alone so loud, As if the cause had made the mourner proud? For after noble Mustapha is slain Who can enough, without my help complain? Rox. Ah Queen! add to your grief by looking there. Zanger is dead, and his own Murderer. Queen. Zanger! I did not think Fate could have shown (After it took away my King and Throne) Another loss which could a grief impose To make me weep as justly as for those. Why did not Zanger fatal vertue lack Since it did highest Friendship cruel make? Grief grows too hard for our complaints alone When the Worlds loss is greater then our own. Rox. Ah Mustapha! I hither came to grieve [Aside. That by thy death I made my Zanger live; But he too soon for my offence has paid; And I, thy Traytor, am by him betraid. Madam, your tears will now injurious be; [Turns to the Queen. In grief, as honour, you out-rival me. Queen. You Zanger lov'd, then do not me reprove Grieving for two who had no fault but love. Enter Haly. Rox. Haly! If you come nearer you'l despise All Glory and repent that you have Eyes. Haly. The Sultan, full of horrour, did relate A Tragick story of such dismal fate As keeps me from approaching out of fear To see what it was cruelty to hear. But these high sorrows are accompany'd With others which compassion fain would hide. Rox. VVill Heav'n more weight on our affliction lay? Haly. Madam, the Guards and Train of Mustapha Assault the Camp with their united Force, And are assisted by Prince Zanger's Horse. The Sultan, arm'd against this sudden rage, Is now advanc'd their fury to asswage. Rox. O fatal strife where Victors nothing gain! Haly. The Viziers by his order are both slain. Madam, to you, as Regent for your Son, [Turns to the Queen. The Sultan does present th'Hungarian Crown. The old Moravian Troops are by command, Prepar'd to march against King Ferdinand. You, with your Son, may now to Buda go To meet your Friends and to pursue your Foe. Your Restoration he before design'd When first the Empress with his purpose joyn'd: But this dispatch he justly has confest Is the effect of Zanger's last request. Queen. The looks of gratitude should chearful be; But, Zanger, I am so oblig'd by thee, As it occasion gives to make me mourn That to the dead I nothing can return. Rox. Madam, the Sultan's bounty strait receive; And, in your absence, trust me here to grieve. Queen. Madam, I'le with my Son to Buda go And my last duty to his Father show: Then in a shady Cloister will remain, And, as a fatal Mourner, still complain Of that which here both you and I have lost, Where death does over love in triumph boast. I shall undo my Son if I look back On those whom I unwillingly forsake; I'm more concern'd in what I leave behind Then in the joys he shall in Buda find. Rox. Go, Madam, go, and hasten to your Throne! Live to find Zanger's Friendship in your Son. Be with much pow'r more happy then I prov'd; Live to be fear'd, and yet continue lov'd. Queen. I'le flye from pow'r; but yours to the distrest Has been a refuge and should be increast, Till (when you weary grow) your suppliants sue That Heav'n may be a refuge then to you. [They Embrace. [Exeunt Queen, and Haly. Enter Zarma at the other door. Zarma. The Mufty is within, and bad me say That he is sent to counsel you to pray. Rox. Why dost thou weep? I do not dying fear: Thou griev'st because Grief's remedy is near. I'le meet the Mufty, and for death prepare: Lead me this way, for I would shun despair. [She looks backwards towards the dead Bodies and goes from them. Exeunt. The Scene changes. Enter Achmat, Haly. Achmat. The tortur'd Viziers did their guilt confess; And, e're they dy'd, accus'd the Sultaness: Who to their first proposal did encline; But by ambitious Rustan the design (In hope to gain her favour) was begun; And was pursu'd by her to save her Son. Haly. The Guards and noble Train of Mustapha Have got renown though they have lost the day. Achm. Till Solyman in person did appear They, in their fierce assault, Victorious were. With Thirty Thousand Horse they brav'd the Field; Of which Five Hundred are not left unkil'd. He pardon'd those and pitty'd their offence; But they so hated life and lov'd the Prince That it was harder to preserve those few Then 'twas t'o'recome the many whom we slew. VVhen rumour (swift, though it flies low) had spread Through all our Camp that Mustapha was dead, And that his Friends, who had that battel fought, VVere only for his safety hither brought. Then the Victorious threw their Arms away, And wept for those whom they did lately slay. Some, who had kill'd their Sons, more tears did shed For their own guilt, then that their Sons were dead; Guilt wrought by Fate, which had their valour mov'd Against that Prince whom they for valour lov'd. Enter Solyman, Zarma. Haly. His Brows are full of Clouds, his Eyes of Fire; There's dang'rous Thunder near: let us retire. [Exeunt Achmat, Haly. A Table, with Staandish, and a Chair upon the Stage. Sol. VVell, call her in; and do as I command. You, with her VVomen, must be still at hand. The Musty is of use; let him attend. [Exit Zarma. Thy progress, Love, was long, but it shall end. By Beauty (which does even the wise delude) The valiant ever soonest are subdu'd. 'Tis nature's snare, and in defiance laid; For when least hidden we are most betray'd. Beauties fair hand has many a mighty name Too foully blotted in the Book of Fame. Accursed Beauty! 'tis at last to thee That Famous Chiefs have ow'd their infamie. Oh what? has it not done, and may do still. Enter Roxolana. Rox. I come to know Heav'ns pleasure in your will. Soly. Draw nearer then! Alas! be not afraid When 'tis too late to fear. Speak, have you pray'd? For you have much to lose, but more to save. Have you been Penitent? Rox. Sultan, I have. Soly. You needed many Tears to wash away The stains which have defil'd this bloody day. Brave Mustapha, and Zanger too is dead; These have deserv'd more Tears than you can shed, Since all in Honour's list they did excel: But in their cause full Thirty Thousand fell; And twice that number were in Battel kill'd By those who did deserve to gain the Field. Rox. Oh, Sultan, do not give me leave to speak; But give that Heart, which loves you, leave to break! Soly. Let it intire a while, for my sake, last. I would not now have mention'd what is past But that 'tis justice and some kindness too To shew sufficient cause for what I do, Which else might cruel seem; for you must dye. Rox. When you bring death I will not ask you, why? Soly. It shews the civil greatness of your mind When to your Punisher you can be kind: But 'twill oblige me and become you too, More then your fatal beauty e're did do, If you so gracefully depart from life As fits our Childrens Mother and my Wife. Rox. Perhaps I liv'd unworthy of your fame, But none shall Roxolana's dying blame: Yet I must grieve so as I ought to do When I, by leaving life, depart from you. Soly. You may your little debts of kindness pay; But I must be oblig'd another way, Which will be first by your confession shown: Confessing not what you, but I have done. Rox. Ah, Sir! most willingly I will confess You found me in the Region of distress; A Flow'r but newly sprung, and in the shade. My growth I from your shining favour had. Soly. This, is not the confession I would hear, It shews untimely gratitude or fear; And makes me guilty of upbraiding you With what Love's secret pow'r did make me do. I aim not to be told what I have done By loves perswasive force, and but to one; For when you lov'd me too that debt was paid, And debts, discharg'd, none justly can upbraid. Rox. Ah do not, Sir, forbid my thankfulness! Soly. You quite mistake the thing you should confess. 'Tis not what Love but Honour made me do For all your Sex, and not alone for you. Though the strict Laws of Ottoman's high Race Did not allow our Sultans e're should grace The Mothers of their Sons with priviledge Of Marriage, yet your Sex I did oblige, And lifted you above the scorns of life, When I, by sacred forms, made you my Wife. Rox. This is but mention'd to augment the sence, Which you suspect I want, of my offence. Or else you shew me that I useless grow Whilst I confess but what the people know. Soly. If what I did was then by Honour done Let me that Honour keep when you are gone. Let me the favour of your Sex retain: Which since I justly did by Marriage gain I would not lose it now by Deaths divorce, Whilst they unjustly think I want remorse; And that my justice is but cruelty, Because my Wife does by my sentence die. Rox. Do but instruct me, Sultan, how I may; In death, for all my life's offences pay? Soly. It is not fit our Priesthood or Divan Should sit to judge the Wife of Solyman. But yet the blood by your ambition spilt, Cries out so loud 'gainst your audacious guilt, That now my People, Armies, and the State, Behold your Beauty with malicious hate: And no expedient e're can satisfie The justice they expect unless you die. You only can to Heav'n for mercy trust. Rox. Sir, I will die, that they may find you just. Soly. But, that your Sex may ever think me so, You must a form of process undergo Which strict necessity does make me use. You must, under your hand, your self accuse. Which, as a true Record, may rescue me From false opinions of my crueltie. Rox. Ah Sultan! This proceeding is severe! Soly. You nobly should your own impeachment bear Least you a ruder from our Bashaws hear. Go, Roxolana, sit, and write it down. Rox. I, with my crime, shall make my duty known. [Leads her to the Table. Soly. Be brief and clear. Posterity should know The hidden root which made your mischief grow. When the first causes we of ills discern We safely and with ease prevention learn. You had your aids in the conspiracy; My Viziers else had not been doom'd to die. [He steps to her whilst she is writing. What form do you in your confession use? Rox. Sultan! I wholly do my self accuse. And yet the dying, sure, may blame the Dead Who safely are by Death from danger freed: Besides both they and I shall straight appear Where Heaven's just Monarch will the injur'd hear. Soly. Accuse your self and let their guilt alone. Rox. If the contrivance was by them begun May I not make of Truth peculiar use And crimes extenuate when I shun excuse? Soly. Already is your whole contrition spent. Leave off if you unwillingly repent. [He offers to take up the Paper, She rises and holds it aside. Rox. Forgive, me Sultan, and I will proceed. Soly. Oh Heav'n! when she so much does pardon need Can I deny it and endure to live? I cannot be forgiv'n, if I forgive, So much her crime all mercy does exceed; For Mustapha and Zanger too is dead. Make haste! write fully your ambition down In changing the succession of my Crown. Rox. Pardon the Tears I on the Paper shed! If I have written what you cannot read. Soly. Forgive her Heav'n here take my Handkercher Dispatch! why do you pause? Rox. I'le hasten, Sir. [She rises again. But whilst I now my crime at full express Let me a little speak in much distress. Soly. Your time forbids the tediousness of grief; Complain not when you cannot have relief. Yet you may speak. Take courage, but be brief. Rox. Sir, this confession a Record must be To save you from imputed cruelty. Heav'n give you, Sir, an everlasting fame, And Heav'n perswade you to prevent my shame. I have but little through ambition done; Nature did more, and 'twas to save my Son. Soly. What did mysterious nature make you do? Could you at once be kind and cruel too? Farewel, you are relaps'd, worse then before. Rox. Sultan, I'le write, and I will speak no more. [She sits down again. Enter Haly. Haly. Sultan, I shew my Duty in my haste; For with new Clouds your Camp is over-cast: The Bloody bus'ness of this fatal day Grows bloodi'r since the death of Mustapha. The Janizaries, by their Aga led, Accuse the Empress, and demand her Head. Roxolana rises and seems disorder'd. They have their grievance by their Aga sent, And he attends at th'entrance of your Tent. Soly. They trust my yielding but shall feel my force. Bid Achmat face them with my Syrian Horse. You must your best disguise of Friendship wear, And meet the Aga with the looks of fear, Call him to Council, and disorder'd seem; And when he is admitted, strangle him. [Exit Haly. These threatning Tumults only dang'rous are To Monarchs who dare less then Subjects date. Goes to Roxolana. Sit down! is your confession finish'd yet? Rox. Sultan, it is. Soly. I'le read what you have writ. She kneeling gives him the Paper. Rox. Sir, now I feel the torments of true fear, Because your dangers great as mine appear. Give to rude hands the life which I must lose, If you defend it you your own expose. Soly. No, Roxolana, you shall calmly die. You shall find justice, but no cruelty. Your Women wait without; the Musty too: What must be done they decently shall do. Enter Haly and kneels. Haly. The sudden Tempest suddenly is past. [She rises. No Clouds can long before your lustre last. With Tears the Janizaries now implore That favour which their rage disdain'd before. Sir, Achmat for the Aga's life does sue; Which he repriev'd to have it sav'd by you: It will a Triumph to the Army give Who are with grief subdu'd. Soly. Go, let him live. [Exit Haly. Rox. Ah Solyman! shall she who heretofore, Still with success, for others did implore Be now deni'd when for her self she sues? I beg not what I ought, Sir, to refuse If it were granted, your consent to live. Oh take my life, but my offence forgive. Soly. Oh why did Heav'n such perfect beauty make Yet let such beauteous things perfection lack? Love against Justice in my bosom strives. Let Justice pardon Love what Love forgives. [He takes her up. Rise, Roxolana, you shall mercy find. But as when you were cruel you were kind, So I will deeds by your Example do; For I will now be kind and cruel too. Rox. Heav'n which begins to take your Clouds away, Will from departing night make break of day. Soly. I give you life, and I forgive your crime; Yet in this kindness I shall cruel seem. Rox. Oh stay, Sir, and but hear what I'le implore. Soly. Your doom is seal'd. I'le never see you more. Rox. Ah, Sir, you gave what I can ne're enjoy; What you preserv'd you instantly destroy. Soly. Zarma! call all to look on my remorse; And then be witnesses of our divorce. Enter Zarma, four of Roxolana's Ladies, Achmat, Haly, the three Attendants of Mustapha and Zanger, eight of the Guard, and six Pages. The number on the Stage being now twenty four. Take with your life perpetual Banishment. Long may you live that you may much repent: But from my sight be still so far remov'd, As I may quite forget I ever lov'd. Rox. Ah, Sultan, do but hear what I can say! Soly. Oh cruelty, you kill me if you stay. Rox. I'le but forgiveness beg for love and grief Since both offend you when they seek relief. Soly. Oh Heav'n! still will you speak? Rox. Sir, I'le depart, And at your feet leave a forsaken heart. [Exit. Soly. Farewel for ever, and to Love farewel! I'le lock my Bosom up where Love did dwell; I will to Beauty ever shut my eyes, And be no more a Captive by surprize: But Oh, how little I esteem a Throne When Love, the Ornament of Pow'r is gone! Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
