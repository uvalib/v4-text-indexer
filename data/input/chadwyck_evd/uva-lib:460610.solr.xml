      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âFlorence. A Room in Lambertazzi's Palace. Lambertazzi alone. Lam. Now do I momently expect my friend,â My friend of Boyhood's hours, so long estranged!â This very expectation doth rain back On my hoar head, the dreams of buried years, The hopesâthe thoughtsâthat burning Boyhood knew: Like leaves which long at the old tree's foot have lain, Uplifted by a sudden gustâand sent In whirling wantonness some little space Fluttering to dance, around the naked boughs Of wintered barrenness!âa show of Lifeâ The Ghost of what is gone!âbut yet in sooth So sapless, sere and sharpened, that they make That ancient Wrestler with the storms, still more Look like a blasted and a blighted thing, Apparelled thus with ruin and decayâ And decked with dallying desolations, till They shoot like lightnings round it more than leaves! Then sink and leave it to worse loneliness! Enter Nicolo. Nico. My Lord!âthe Count Visconti waits without. Lam. Not for one moment longer!âbid him here! [Exit Nicolo. With how much pride shall I present to him My fair adopted child!âmy gentlest nieceâ The blossom and the blessing of mine ageâ The dearest thing that ever yet was dear! Enter Count Visconti. Friend of mine earliest fortunes, and best years!â Thrice welcome, to my House and Hearth and Heart! Vis. Let me greet thee as lovingly and fairly!â 'Tis well with me that on thy Threshold thus Once more I stand;âthe annihilated Times Crowd back on Memoryâtill the Presentâfalls Prostrate before the Past that plays her part!â How is't with thee, my friend? how hath it been?â Dear Brother of my bosomâTime hath marked Thine aspect all the heavier, that thy Heart Antagonized too well his withering powers!â Emotions age us in the appearance more Than flight of time, or flow of equal life!â Lam. My Life hath been a battle!âI have borne But never bowed!âand those who bow not, bear A thousand-fold, what those who stoop the head And let the storm sweep, hurrying o'er them, do! But ne'er that needful lesson have I learned Through Lifeâto bend!â Vis. If it would grieve you notâ I pray youâLambertazzi, to relate The history of your by-past life to me;â Perplexing rumours reached meâfrom yourself (And rarely you despatched a hurried line); I little heard, save brief assurances Of your unaltered friendshipâof your health And general welfare.âYet at times methought I could detect the struggling sufferance through The tutored terms in which those lines were couched. Lam. To thee!âthough to none other,âwill I thus!â Rememberest thou, how when we parted here Some five and twenty years agoâwith shame And sharp remorse I did to thee confide The story of my short-lived love for One Whom I had foully injured and aggrieved, The Estremaduran Inez? Vis. Serves me well My memory thusâAlas! a cruel case! Lam. A base and barbarous!âHow I dared to stand Before the Altar with her hand in mineâ And by vile mockery of a marriage win Her unsuspecting SoulâI cannot now Conceive e'en in imagination!âWell!â I have been punished!âMy poor boy was born About the time, Visconti, that you left Our fairest Florence, on the sudden. Vis. Yes, I do recall that circumstance, nor yet Forget the transports of remorse that shook Your frame, when first those tidings reached your ear. Lam. Well might they! well they might!âalthough no love For Inez then survived, save that indeed Which such announcement for awhile compelledâ I could not choose but mourn to think of themâ The unwedded mother and the unwelcomed boyâ Thou know'st my wayward heart was then enslaved By lovely Luigia Cenci?âlong betrothed Unto mine elder brotherâAndrea. Vis. True!â And she returned your passionâbut in vain! Lam. In vain!âHer father, obdurate and harsh, Doomed her to wed the Elder!âthen possessed Of wealth untold, and finding her young heart Was irretrievably, and all, mine own, Fearful of fatal consequenceâand deaf To Nature's voiceâtoo pitiless and proudâ He hastened on those hateful nuptials!âthus Was she, the unhappiest One and helpless made Ere long, most miserablyâthe Sacrifice!â Vis. Methinks I heard that after two brief years Of wedded life, her health slow-undermined Gave way, and Death cut down the broken flower, But not ere sweet Luigia had become The mother of two lovely babes! Lam. 'Twas so!â Soon after her maternal hopes were crowned The second time, she passed from the earth awayâ The loveliest of the Beautiful!âthe best And gentlest of the Good!âPeace dwell with her! Vis. Was there foundation for the strange report Which reached meâthat your Brother's son and yours Were both mysteriously conveyed awayâ Stol'nâseized onâin their blossoming infancy? Lam. Alas! there was!âit is a startling tale! Four rapid years had just rolled o'er my head, Since my child's birth, when I at length received An answer, to my long-disdained appealsâ And applications anxiousâoft renewedâ From Inez' haughty parentsâ(Still had I Precipitated prayers on prayersâto themâ Showered supplications thick on supplications, For of her place of hiding knew I nought, Nor gained the tidings that I thus implored. They came at last!âand heavy-sad they were!) This answer (couched in stern and scornful terms In some brief linesâabrupt and angry) told That Death had closed the sufferingsâcloaked the shame Of their most wretched Daughter, who had seen In some lone convent, her last suns go down. I sent to urge my unprotected boy Should straightforth be unto my roof conveyed,â Consigned unto my careâaddressing this, My fatherly request, in humblest terms Of deep contrition, to those injured Parents;â They deigned no farther answer, but despatched The child at once to meâwho hither came Attended by a faithful Spanish nurse. One year elapsedâmy Brother's boy and he Were most inseparable companions, when With their respective nurses once abroad They both were kidnapped!âmost inhumanly And most mysteriously!ânor ever more Were heard of! Vis. And was there no clue obtained To this extraordinary deed of darkness?â No information ever gained, I pray, Of this unheard-of act of villany? Lam. No, never! never!âNo real clue!â'Twas thought Some desperate miscreants who composed a part Of a vile gang of brigands which just then Infested all this country, had contrived To seize the infants with their nursesâlured By some rich trinkets which they wore;âstrict search Was indefatigably made;âthe gang, Perchance, alarmed by threatenings of pursuit, 'Twas found, had broken up, dispersed and fled, Nor ever could be traced!âMy Brother mourned In bitterness of spiritânot for long!â Thou mayst remember haply that his frame Was ever delicateâin briefâhe died, And nought remained of him but the orphaned girl, Whom I adopted for mine own, and love As though ten thousand times mine own she were! Vis. And since, hath nothing e'er occurred to throw A light o'er these dark clouds of circumstance? Lam. Sealed papers were conveyed some seven years since To me with hints, whose meaning seemed to be, That my poor boy had perished; these contained Advice beside, to abstain from vain endeavours To penetrate these mysteriesâfor the rest, Of Andrea's Heir has nothing yet transpiredâ No scantiest hint. Vis. Most strange and singular! Thou hast had trials sharp and sore, poor friend! Lam. I have had, and I have!â Vis. Thou hast?âI hoped That now tranquillity had smoothed the tides Of thy long-troubled Life. Lam. Believe it not! No! no! Tranquillity and I ne'er met, And never shall!âof late my Life hath been Disturbed by fresh Disquietudes. Vis. And how? Lam. Thou know'st the place so long I occupied Of Trust and Power, and Favour in this Courtâ Well! I have lost it. There has been a youth, A low unknown Adventurer tooâfrom Spain, Who chanced in battle, at great risk, to save The Grand Duke's life, and win his gratitude; (Led on by instinct of self-profit doubtlessâ The involuntary impulse of place-huntingâ And the animal sharp appetite of gainâ Which made him act mechanically thus;) This boy hath carried all before him; ploughed Myself and others from each path of Power, And ridden rough-shod o'er us all. His pride And shameless insolence and boldness rank, Created envy and disgust and hate, Which girt him round and panted for his fall. At length his rash Presumption most uncurbed, In hurrying on forced wars impolitic, And intermeddling with the affairs of State, Using the Duke's name in unsanctioned sortâ Devoured by keen ambition as he isâ Procured himâbanishmentâbut some strange turn In the Duke's mind, perchance, hath now revoked That wholesome Sentenceâhe is here again!â Or shortly will beâpardoned and recalled!â And we must bowâLordsâPeople,âall must bow To that worst despotismâa Favourite's tyranny! I own I much mislike himâpurposelyâ As I believeâhe crosses all my schemes. Vis. I have heard of him!âfor of course thou mean'st The well-known youth Algarves?â Lam. Yes, the same! But soft! (Costanza enters.) My Child!âcome hither!âcome,âadvance!â Let me present thee to the truest friend Thy second father ever had!âone, too, Thine own poor Father loved right dearly well, The noble Count Visconti! Cos. Needs no more!â I am most proudly happy, Sir! be sure. Dear Uncle! I am come now to prefer A slight requestâsay, may I go forthwith With Fiorilina to her Father's house, Where all those dresses we have ordered late, For the forthcoming revel at the Duke's, Are now collectedâfor our word and choice? Lam. Yes, Sweet!âis she in the inner chamber now? Cos. She waits me there. Lam. We'll join her then, and show The Count Visconti what a master's hand Thou hast for Painting!âis that Picture yet Completed thou'st so aptly handled? Cos. Nay! To-morrow sees it finished though, I trust. [Exeunt all. Scene II. âA Room in Prince Diodati's House. Fiorilina and Costanza. Cos. I came with thee to please thee, sweetest Friendâ Thou know'st not how I sicken at the sight Of those disgustful dressesâhow my Heart Detests their frippery and their finery all! Fio. Heyday! and what may be the cause that thus You spite the innocent dressesâsmiling there In all their spangled bravery?âbut I guessâ Cos. (hastily.) Thou dost notâno!âit is but that I think This Festa at the Ducal Palace held Will be most tedious. Fio. Was the last so?âheigh? Cos. Why, no!âbut thenâperhapsâthis will be!âAh!â The last!âmy Uncle wished me not to goâ I tired him out with my entreaties till He gave consentâit was a joyful time!â But this!âI would not go to thisâmethinksâ But then my Uncle seems to wish it much, And urges me to go. Fio. And therefore Thou, Out of sheer obstinacy's rank caprice, Wouldst stay at home; thus seems the case to lie. Thy uncle wishes thee to stay away, And therefore thou wouldst give the world to goâ Thy Uncle wishes thee to grace the ball, And therefore thou wouldst keep thyself at home, And sit and sulk away with all thy might!â Why!âthou'rt a very rebel!âWell!âI vowâ I think thy ill-used feetâif they may have The least of Spirit in them, and should chance To catch the sprightly Viol's cheery sound, Will e'en turn rebels too, and bear thee swift In tripping triumph of fantastic freedom Right to the very thickest of the Ball. Cos. Oh! do not think that I can pleasure find In thwarting my dear Uncle!âOh! no! no! But thou art in some most tiresome wrangling mood, And most unamiable indeed to-day. Fio. Not I!âto prove I am notânow I think I know a little pretty piece of news Would change you in one second. Cos. Nay, not so!â Fio. I do! Come, choose your dressâand all in smiles I venture to pronounce you yet will go To this fair Festa. Cos. Nay! you are unkindâ You are most unkind. You say so but to grieve me. I know far better; must I not know best? Fio. Still better then than best believe I know! Wilt please thee choose?âWilt have this padusoy?â Or this fair Tyrian-tinctured stiff brocadeâ This murrey-coloured three-piled velvetâor This Fire of Egypt taffetaâor that With silvery borderingsâor this cendale silkâ Of tender apricotâor this belikeâ Rich cloth of gold with flowers of Cramoisieâ Cos. (pettishly.) Torment me not unseasonably thusâ Leave teasingâfor you plague me past enduranceâ The annoyance tries my temper, even o'ermuch!â You vex me, painâgrieveâspite me barbarously, Unamiable, unfeelingâmost ungentle!â Give over worrying meâthank Heaven, 'twill cease! Their end must haveâthese odious Preparationsâ And this more odious Prospect!â Fio. Aye! good sooth! Banquets and Balls must come unto an end And so mayâBanishments!âCos. starts.) Why, how now! heigh? Cos. Oh! dearest Fiorilinaâkindestâbestâ Sweetest and gentlest, sayâbut say! Fio. Good lack!â Well! here be sudden changes!âwas I not The torturerâthe tormenterâruffling so Your temper's chrystal smoothness?âNow it seems, I am the gentlest, tenderestâmost beloved!â Come! be but honestâI will be so too, And tell thee all I knowâconfess thy Heart Is given to young Algarves in all loveâ Cos. Nay!ânay! Fio. Oh! thou would-be Deceiver, cease! 'Tis vain to try and hide that little heartâ 'Tis like a fluttering bird seen through a netâ 'Tis vain to blush and frown and say, Nay! nay! I say, Yea! yea!âand drive your frightened words, Which Conscience makes most trembling cowards, backâbackâ Upon their faultering way!â Cos. Now shame on thee!â To triumph so ungenerously!âand yetâ Well!âI must ownâmy secret, like a sword, Eats deep into its sheathâmy heart!âYes!âyes!â I love himâit is all too trueâwoe's me!â Now quickly, quickly, tell me all thou know'st!â Fio. Thus much, thenâthrough the unwearying instances Of his true friendsâfor he hath such at Courtâ And through the kind Duke's cordial willingness To be convinced, his sentence is revoked, And he to Florence will return at once! Cos. All tremblingly I take this Happiness Unto my deepest Soul!âI love!âI love!â My heart says this within me day and nightâ And I would say it to his Soul for ever! Fio. And dost thou know how much the noble Count Thine Uncle doth mislike this same fair youth?â It is supposed he spites him grievously. Cos. I fear Alphonzo hath displeased him oftâ Pronouncing judgments adverse from his own, And differing with him, in grave matters muchâ But yet ifâifâsome love for me may dwellâ Which I do think and trustâwithin the heart Of young Algarves, he will seek to win More favourable opinions and regardings From my good Uncle!âthen this banishment May have subdued in some slight sort, at lengthâ That fiery spirit of aspiring flightâ That far outsoared the eagle!âhe hath learned, We well may hope, to check and to controul The ambitious daring of his natureânot To yield those glowing hopes that led him onâ But better guide him to their brightest Havens!â Fio. Oh! find not fault with these great flights of Soul!â Such noble restlessnessâsuch discontentâ Such struggling to attain a goal unseen, Is proudly eloquentâwhere'er it lurksâ Of the Immortality that glows within And thus believeâwhere fires so deathless burn Within the Soul, the Heart o'erfloweth more With all the trembling tendernesses born Of the uttermost of Passion!âand is made A thousand times more startlingly alive To all the fine susceptibilitiesâ To all selectest spiritualized emotionsâ The veriest shades and touches of quick feelingâ Than theirs, that hovering scarce o'er Life's Horizon Dwell, girt habitually with the Elements Of common Lifeâthe little and the low: Doth not the Skylark when it sinks at length Into its nest of love more blest appear, Than that dull worm which never soars at all?â The loftiest flights estrange it not from earthâ But seems it notâthat winged careerer proudâ (Made in itself a half-celestial thing,) To draw Heaven down with it where it descends? Oh!âdeepest sinks the flood of feeling, where The towering pride of zeal the highest springs! The wave, whose crest rose nearest to the cloud, Into the most unfathomed chasmy fall, Holloweth itselfâprecipitously profound. Oh! find no fault then with the immortal Soul, Because, through strong upspringings and aspiringsâ Its Heavenward-pointing thoughts it dares enfranchise, And would fulfil its destinyâand follow!â The Heart meanwhile's the Husbandman that gathers The heavenly Harvest inâfor Love and Home!â Cos. Thy words alarm me!âFiorilina!âwhy!â Art thou not touched with tenderness thyselfâ For this proud Zealot of Ambition's Creed?â Ten thousand jealousies distract my heartâ Twin Souls so much alike!âthou lov'st himâThou!â Fio. Who?âI! I love!âNo! no!âI hold Love still To be a Revolution in the State Of our great Soul!âOur subject Thoughts rebel Against their lawful rightful SovereignâSelf!â And choose a foreign Lord from whence upspring Strange male-administrationsâfeuds internalâ Distractionâstrifeâdisorganization frightfulâ While the irresponsible and distant Despot Afar remains in free securityâ Haply enjoying all the harm he causes!â Amused with all the havoc that he makes!â I will be Queen and Mistress in my Soul!â And no Usurper shall dispute my Powerâ No vain Pretender share or shake my Throneâ My thoughts shall be my faithful lieges stillâ My feelings all, my vassals leal and true! My Personal Form of Government is simpleâ (I might well call itâa pure selfishness!) I will explain it in a few brief wordsâ It isâbe very sureâa Monarchyâ The Constitutionâadmirably arrangedâ A Representative Systemâwhere my wishes (Right strong Constituencies) depute my thoughtsâ (Painstaking senators and most obedient) To seize their slightest hints, and make themâacts. These influence most materially my movementsâ These same good wishes, powerful and determined, These I consult on all occasions closely, And carefully their views do still adopt. I have invented thus, you may perceive, A new and worthy Form of Government, At least, not Iâbut young Algarves, 'twas Conceived this Plan, when talking on a day (Of ConstitutionsâStatesâReforms and Rights) With my good BrotherâStirring spirits both, And restless innovators evermoreâ If not in practiceâin Imagination! Cos. Dost thou not love! how canst thou have described So well what thou hast never learned to feel? Fio. From watching thee!âthe looker on sees most Thou know'stâo' the game; thou wert my School and Study. Cos. Oh, proudâand blitheâand light of heart art thou!â And walkest the Earth in glad securityâ But yet the hour may come to tame thy Heart. Fio. Tame!âTame the Hyena first!âNo!âNo!âfore Heaven!â I'll none on't!â Cos. Boastings are no bulwarks!â Fio. No! But brazen-facedness proves a worthy breastplate!â If it is seen you will not be subdued, And mock at dangers very valiantly; You're left in Peaceâat least, I thus have found it. Cos. The attack will come!â Fio. I am armed 'gainst all attacks! If the Enemy dare show his baby face (This same Dan Cupid's but a beardless boy) Just on the frontiers, I am up in armsâ This little kingdom of myself's awakenedâ Arousedâassembling all its forces straightâ The alarums of my sensitive suspicions Make all the Land to conscious credence start! My sentinels are still on the look out!â One sigh would like an earthquake rouse all the empire, And put me on my guard at once!âa sigh!â Oh! not the phalanxed chariots' thunderous roll Were half as fearful!âI should lead at once My Hosts, to rout the vile insidious Foeâ Whose Preparations for the Assault had made That little tremourâwhich betrayed the approach!â And drew the vengeance down which he deserved! The wingÃ«d Armies of my fiery wills Are ready to do battle in the cause!â I am well garrisoned round with troops on troops Of faithful thoughts that live and die with me!â My Fortresses are all in good repairâ ScornâIndependenceâVanityâPrideâArtâ Why even my very Fear's a Fortress!âSoâ Thou see'st the foe can have no chance with me!â Cos. Why, thou hast the veriest braggadocio spirit!â I almost yet could find it in my heart To wish myself more like thee.âNo! no! no!â My silken slavery is more dear by far Than this thine iron Independenceâthough I have much sufferedâmore than tongue can tell, Or Fancy to herself depictâor Memory Keep freshly on her tablets, since with tears She still would blot out what she wroteâagain.â And yetâI would not be more like to thee!â Nor would I give thee one sweet-bitter pangâ One darling painâone throe of power intenseâ Nor share one sting of suffering with theeâ Fio. Pray Keep all these curious comforts to yourself!â I swear I would not rob you for the worldâ I am not quite so covetous!â Cos. Ah! well! well!â You'd die of envy if you knew the bliss Of this divine distractionâ(Fio. shakes her head)âbut you would!â Oh! I have sufferedâWhat of that?âsweet saints! Saddening for him is scarcely sorrow!âno! A lovely anguishâ'tisâa charming griefâ A costly miseryâa celestial gloomâ Which still should boast more dearâmore hallowed name!â I feel all other earthly happiness Would seem like very wretchedness indeed; Beside this dear despondenceâ Fio. Let me have This poor, despised, vain earthly Happinessâ And thou mayst keep all the celestial Misery!â Cos. Flouter!âbut I forgive thee, and bestow My heartiest pity on thee!â Fio. Seriously, Hast thou indeed, Costanza, borne so much?â Hast suffered truly with such bitterness?â Cos. Aye! have I!â Fio. What!âwhen he was here, didst thou Love with such sad profundity of pain?â Wert thou unhappyâthen?â Cos. I know not!ânay!â I had some Happinessâa dubious kind!â To sit and look at him by stealthâin dreadâ As 'twere to draw all Heaven into the Soulâ To listen to each word that passed his lips, And hoard them in my heart, and make my thoughts Their echoes everlastinglyâto feel The consecrated air I breathedâby him Was also breathedâwas this not Happiness? Fio. In your vocabulary this may have The name of Happinessâin mine!âno matter!â Poor Friend!âI sorrow in your sorrow much. I must confess I long suspected this!â Cos. And can you wonder?âOh! I wonder most All womankind love not the matchless One!â Fio. They all do love the matchless One! Cos. What mean'st? Fio. That ev'ry woman thinks her own adorer, Though he be fit to fright a horse with plainness, The Paragon unparallel'd!â Cos. Mock on!â I care not!âHeavens! And shall I see thee soon, Alphonzo!âOh! the music in thy name Thrills through me as a thousand clarions shook me!â Thy Beauty is too terrible to me;â My whole Soul dies before thee!âThe adoration Drinks up its Life immortal!âand like Death, Drains my deep Heart's-blood!âOh! the o'erpowering thought!â It is too muchâI cannot bear itâno!â I cannot bear the unutterable, the unknown, The intolerable,âth' untamed,âuntold,âdeep Love!â It crushes all my Soul into Herselfâ She scarce observes what outward objects areâ The worlds withinâwhat are they? Thine, all thine! No breathâno blissâno bloomâno being nowâ Save as the Heavenly Tyranny ordains!â And shall I see him!âOh! I tremble! Saints!â It is a crushing moment and a fearfulâ A terrible momentâwhen I see him first:â I die away in many fearsâand droop!â I die away in swooning dissolutionsâ Such flutterings, and such faulterings, and such faintnessâ And then but live to find him goneâworse death! Oh! had I million Soulsâwere all his Slaves!â Fio. Now, put a spice of scorns and spites, I pray, Into this honeyed sickliness of Love!â Else 'twill a cloying compound prove, I doubt;â None love so well, as those love savagely!â With due admixture of the ingredients good Of vanityâfierce prideâand wild capriceâ Perversity and obstinacy tooâ Bold independence, and light reckless mirth In their fair loaves of Love,âtrue staff of Life!â Indeed, I fain would recommend besides A little leaven of Indifferenceâjust Enough to lighten and to rarify The rather heavy nature of the food!â Yes! something of Indifference there should be, Or, at the least, the semblance of itâelse 'Tis but a leaden lumpâwhen all is done!â Cos. Indifference!âwhyâif you can have, indeed, Your noble scornâprideâvanityâcapriceâ And such delightful heighteners of the savour, You must have a preponderating portion, Be very certain, of Indifference first! Fio. âLong live Indifference!â is my cry for ever! Pleasure and peace are her glad followers still!â Oh! couldst thou see as I seeâbut thou'rt blind!â A mote in the Heart is worse, alas! far worse Than twice an hundred beams were in the eye!â A moteâpoor thing!âhath got into thy heartâ Would I could pluck it out for thee!â Cos. Art sure There is no blinding beam now in thine own? Fio. As sure as that the mote in thineâif'twere Transferred to mineâwould prove a mote indeedâ A weak mote in a sunbeamâor if thou Admirest more poetic illustrationsâ A mite in some great mountain of a cheese! For my part I prefer still the Sublime! Cos. Oh! I do love him! 'tis a bliss to say it! The Universe with all its marshalled worlds, Its scattered mysteries and its clustered marvels, Recedes before my gazeâand nothing is But himâin Heaven or Earth!âMy Earth and Heaven!â Enter Demetrio, Guicciardini, and Cesare. Dem. (to Cos. Lady, I kiss thy handsâthy lowliest slave! (To Fio.)Sweet sister, we are bearers of blythe news Which should make all full welcome!ânow attend, Grant me your closest heed, and listenâ Fio. Wait! Good Brother, wait awhile till I put up A temporary pulpit for you here, From which your grave discourse you may deliver. Dem. And how now?âMadcap!â Fio. Nay!âyou did begin With such a startling bigness of importance, And such injunctions that we should bestow Our full attentionâwas it not so, Sirs?â That you from elevated post should pour Your eloquence on our bespoken ears. Cesa. And, fairest Lady, take my word for't now, Your playful mirth hath robbed you for seven seconds Of a great pleasureâand I doubt besides Put a sharp curb on Curiosity. Cos. In common charity speak out at onceâ Let me not suffer for my sweet Friend's sinsâ Good Signior Guicciardiniâwhat's the news?â (Aside.)Oh my heart leaps to himâAlgarves' friend! Gui. Madam, the news is that His Highness means, After to-morrow, to assemble all The Bright and Gallant in the field, to share His favourite sport of Hawkingâhaving had A noble present from a foreign King Of two Ger-Falcons, most transcendant birds. Fio. I am delightedâ'tis a sport I love; And anything besides must welcome be That merry-making brings and mirthâ Gui. The Duke Is greatly pleased that our dear mutual Friend Algarves, is from banishment recalled. Cos. What, Sir! (Aside) I am most dizzyâI am faintâ What said you?âis the banished Count returned? Gui. No, Madam, I did say recalledâbefore This sun's set, though, I hope 'twill beâreturned!â Dem. My little Fiorilina! hast thou yet Made choice of fair habiliments wherewith To clothe thyself for this state Ball to-morrow?â The fever of anxiety thou art in To look the loveliest there will fret thee so, Thou must be measured by thy milliners When the first dance strikes up, else, I much doubt No dress will fit theeâthou'lt have grown so thin. Fio. Excellent Infamy! right villainous Brother!â These great refinements in the art of dressâ These deep, learned disquisitions from your tongue, Prove to my mind what I have oft suspectedâ What I see there can scarce my Brother be, Unless the tailor too could father me! Thou art the creature of thy clothesâno more! He hath cut thee out with scissarsâfashionedâformedâ And finished theeâwith thread and needle's magic! I think thou'rt only pinned together, though, Now I look closer!âIf a pin fell out, A limb would drop off with itâyes, 'tis so!â And that which tops theeâI declare I see The hard head of the hugest pin!âmust be!â Dem. Excellent Insolence!âThou most scandalous Sister!â I would I were a Porcupine of Pins, So I would punish thine impertinencesâ But Guicciardini!âCesare!âhence!âhaste!â Let's seek the high-road now to greet our Friend The first on his return from Banishment. Gui. Nay! it were best to wait him at my house, I feel most sure he will alight there firstâ Which I indeed entreated him to do In that despatch I penned a week ago, Crammed with congratulations and good wishes. Dem. Have with you, then!âsweet Ladies!ârest you fair. Cesa. I do commend me to your high esteems. Gui. And Iâand hope the Hawking's promised sport Will flush fair cheeks yet richlier at the Festa, As that anticipated joyaunce doth Now light the loveliest eyes that Florence boastsâ [Exeunt Ces., Gui., and Dem. Cos. Now let me leave thee, Fiorilina! since My spirits are so high and low at onceâ My heart in such a whirl and fever strange Of transportâtormentâwonderâdoubtâI feel I must seek some repose!â Fio. And sweet!âthou art paleâ Joy hath o'ertasked thee long o'ertried by grief!â Cos. And such a mixed and strangely troubled joyâ Dashed with sick doubts and veiled in vague suspense. Good even!âmy kind one!âwhen thou say'st thy prayers, Pray earnestly for one who needs much helpâ And scarce hath strength to seek it for herself. Fio. Sweet! Fare thee well! (Aside.) Ah! little doth she know How all my prayers flow into floods of tearsâ And melt more from mine eyes than from my lips! Costanza! stay, I will go down with thee, And see if Monna Laura is arrived, Who should accompany thy footsteps home;â I will to-morrow morning come to thee, And if I learn aught of Algarves, Love!â I will not failâdespite my jeering mockeryâ To make communications straight with theeâ To-morrow morning were an age to waitâ I see your looks speak eloquently thusâ Speak it!âthey shriek it!âwith pathetic anguish!â So I do promise you, forthwith to send My little page, with presents for your Hands Detailing all the interesting events That may have happened ere you sun hath set! AsâMeetings 'twixt Alphonzo and his friendsâ Sundry âGod save ye'sââpressures of the palmâ With questionings touching on the state of the roadsâ Condolences concerning the odious dust That lays its levelling tax on travellersâ Remarks that 'tis eight minutes past the time He was expectedâon his side, perhaps, Tenderest enquiries afterâa hot supper!â Communications confidentialâhaply, Relating to most painful feelingsâeven Sickness of Heartâcaused by an empty stomach!â And gentlest admonitions to the Clerks Official of his kitchenâto despatchâ And make fair speedâand crowd their preparationsâ Joined with gesticulations grave and graceful.â Cos. Well! Banterer! well!âwhate'er thou'lt write is welcome! [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âA Street in Florence a little before Daybreak. Enter Alphonzo. Al. Once more in Florence!âto my very Soul So native nowâthough stranger to my birth!â My Soulâmy Soulâwas born here!âsince 'twas here Love gave me his delicious rapturous Lifeâ And poured the deep wine of his passionate power Through all my kindling and exulting veins!â Costanza!âhast thou ever thought of meâ Lady of all my Love and Life and Hope!â Since last thy looks shot light through my rapt being?â It is an hour of tranced tranquillity, And well consorts with these affectionate thoughts That seem to fill all Earthâas Starsâthe Heaven. I am full early forth!âsince these fair orbs, Bright Angels visible, of the Heavens above us, Are yet so beautiful in the unsunned blue!â Morning!âthou'rt but a Deicide!âand giv'st A death-blow to those throned calm-looking Gods!â That each might seem the full-realmed Lord of Space!â But no!âthey live, and mock thy little mightâ Thy dazzlery's our Darkness!âwe are frail, And find one World to lose ten thousand thus!â Too troubled with one Splendour to see more!â The Sun is as a Wall of Fire built up Between us and these Rivals of his Reign! His Maker's proud misrepresentative!â Most insufficient mirror, still he shines!â The Heavenly Hypocrite!âhe feigns to be The Monarch-Sphere in Solitary Stateâ And we, as such, do recognize him stillâ Blinded to myriads by his single beamâ He, glorying, throws his burning blazing shield O'er his refulgent comrades of the skies, And these weak arrows of our eyes in vain Would reach their royalties of radiance then!â Frail arrows!âthey glance backâat onceâo'ercomeâ From that dread shield, magnificent, of thine!â Bright Warrior, combating Night's shadowy Hosts, And covering thus Light's Legions with thy Lightâ Thou shin'st!âthe Stars fade off like o'erblown flowers!â Little we see of Theeâand nought of Them!â Our eyes can brook not thine o'erpowering blazeâ And for that blaze, can mark not their merged pompâ We are so littleâand so limited!â So lost in poverty and powerlessness!â Lord of all Suns and Systems!âMaker!âThusâ Thou show'st thy treasures but to snatch them backâ To make us feel how weak, how vile we are!â So dost thou darken us with dazzling lightâ As it may be, perchanceâAlmightiest Sire!â When all Eternity comes rushing on Far through the Soul, (which wrestles and which strives, Wavering in that most fiery struggle's pangs,) Thou thus destroy'st with Life's intenseness even!â Destroy'st but to revive!âo'erthrow'stâto raise!â A pause. Well! we are cabinnedâcircumscribedâcontroulledâ But yet our thoughts burst every bound and bar!â The while all, all the unseen Immensity, Swells at our Soulsâand mingles with the Mind!â Since Oh! so proud our high aspirings are, We make the Ungazed-on Universe our own, Through Mind's great Majesties of Consciousness!â The Sun is but a step to lead our thoughts Past all he lightethâor his comrades lightâ To heavenlier Systems, and far higher statesâ And I am One Ambition!âyet, I trust, Beginning not nor ending here, in Selfâ I feel I am ambitious for mankind!â Ambitious for my raceâmy Stateâmy World!â I would acquire the power to aid, and raiseâ Enlightenâbenefitâmy fellow-beingsâ This soaring feeling, ardent and supreme, Is different from the gross ambition born Of sinful selfishnessâas light from darkness!â As this fair morn that grows and glows fast round me From Midnight's cloudliest depths!âA stir of steps! The Citizens begin their busy roundsâ The day hath made swift stridesâthe blessed sight Of my sweet Florence shines into my Soul, Bright as the uprising Sun that comes to light it!â To the late Banished thou'rt more beautifulâ More bright than everâCity of my choice!â(A pause.) Who comes!âby heaven 'tis that obsequious knave, That prying varlet, Millaflores!âheâ Who was the first to turn his back on me, When Fortune seemed to do soâand to help A drowning man to sink!âand now he comes, His face all spread with smiles of welcome, since He hears the Prince's favour hath recalled me!â Enter Millaflores. Milla. Ten thousand welcomes back to Florence!âSir!â Signor Algarves!âif that be the name Still honoured by your bearing it!âbut late Glad rumours of a title new bestowed On you most worthily, have reached our ears, Delighting usâas proving well, how just The Duke's appreciation of your worthâ I pray you to inform me if 'tis true!â Al. Indeed 'tis not, Sir!âand the Duke hath shown His knowledge of me better far by not Glossing my meritsâif I have suchâo'er, With most unnecessary flourish;âsuch, May give some seeming value unto that Which hath no worth, but unto that which hath Can add not!âgild dull woodâbut never frame The diamond round with glass!âExcuse me, Sir, I have important business. Milla. (aside.) Prouder far Than Luciferâas ever!âYet I pray Delay one momentâtell me, have you yet Passed to the royal presence?â Al. I have not. Milla. Beseech you when you do, to tell the Prince How warm a friend of yours I have shown myselfâ That I was here the first to give you greeting, And welcome back to Florence!â Al. As you were The first to take your leave of me and give âGod speed ye!ââwhen from Florence I was forced To make unwilling way,âgood Marquess!âcome!â Give me plain dealingâsuch will I give theeâ I love untortuous singleheartednessâ Simplicity and blunt straight-forwardness, Loathe laboured, labyrinthine tricks of speechâ And sleights of tongueâwhate'er my streights may beâ I ne'er will build a golden bridge of words To'scape from any fears or harms!âNo! no!â Plain deeds love I!âthe better still, the plainer!â I know that you mislike me!âand I know You were right glad to see me in disgrace!â How can it be then it should give you joy To see me thus returned to favour?â Milla. Nay!â Thou dost me grievous wrongâgreat wrong indeed. When thou wert in disgrace, of course, 'twas not My business then to give thee countenanceâno! I trust I know my duties better than To set myself 'gainst His good Highness' pleasureâ It had been gross ill-mannersâsheer bad tasteâ Yourself would surely have despised me for't!â It were an insult to the world to stand 'Gainst its known prejudices or proscriptions!â Could you respect in any way a Friend Who made the World his foe?âin mine own heart I felt your innocence, but what of that?â Innocence is as nothing in itself!â Your greatest guilt is to be guilty deemed!â And the most flagrant crime man can commit Is to incur displeasure 'gainst himâthereâ E'en at head quartersâinexcusable!â Most fatally flagitious!âfor the rest, I bear no personal ill-will to you!â But do assure you o'er and o'er againâ Am most delighted to show homage nowâ To one whom others are on terms with!âthus Would stick at nothing to advance your interestsâ Through fire and flood would for your welfare goâ Serve in all ways that lie within my power,â And help you to revenge yourself on those You may suspect did blacken your fair fame, And cast aspersions on youâam I not Your most devoted humble servant?âmark!â I bowed to you before you noticed meâ Stood cap in hand five minutes till I caught Your gracious eyeâgave you such salutations As I might give unto a brother peer!â Words quotha!âSaints in Heaven! are these not deeds, And weighty deeds too?â Al. Nay! leave fooling, prithee!â Lord Marquess!â(Aside.) The preposterous popinjay!â The affected ape!â(Aloud.) This courtly strain to me Is Hebrew!âI can construe not its meaning, Nor wish to fathom your philosophy. I do entreat youâlet me lack awhile Your honourable CompanyâI wait A friend here on grave business now!â Milla. I go!â Immeasurably delighted to behold Thus, the ornament of Florence once again!â Burthened with news too, to delight all othersâ Your healthâwell-doingâand your safe return!â I pray you keep me in your kind esteem!â (Aside.)Now have I thrown away in folly thus, Just three and thirty smiles of smirking sortâ Wrinklings and workings of this goodly faceâ Warpings and wrigglings of this graceful formâ Innumerable fair bows and bendsâand liesâ The number of the words I utteredâmuch I fear 'tis to no purpose!âyet it mayâ It yet, perhaps, may turn to good account!â [Exit with a low bow. Al. His presence hath aroused profound disgust!â Pshaw!âI will think not on the human reptile!â Would that my Friend were come, that I might hear News of my loved Costanza!âfor last night Our hurried conference left no time to touch On that dear subject.âLove hath well kept pace With mine Ambition!âas that nobly dothâ With all that stirreth, kindleth, and ascendeth!â My thread of thought late brokenâlet me bind!â Yetâyet, the proud hope bears me on, to be As is the crowned palm 'midst all lesser trees!â To be a glory to my time and climeâ Oceanâ'midst thousand swelling streams of Soul!â Sunâ'midst surrounding Stars of fervent Life!â Alpâ'mongst the mountains of Heaven-piercing mindsâ Thisâthis is my ambitionâthis my Hope!â Yetâscarce thus solitarily to reign For ever!âNo!âbut to raise others up To mine own height!âand higherâhigher stillâ Bequeathing so to all Posterityâ A Legacy of loftiness!âI would Through all things make it my one solemn aim, To raise and dignify Mortality!â Would still with this large hope exultant fired, Commence the noblest undertakings, still That others might complete them!âreapâreceiveâ Their blessed benefits, and bask in all The full light of the Immeasurable Success!â I fain would see my fellows cull the fruit Of those fair trees that I shall plantâand trainâ And climb by those proud steps that I shall build!â This is Ambition worthy to keep pace With the clear heavenly-mindedness of Loveâ For it is Love!âthe largestâand the fullest!â Embracing all Creation in its scope!â Enriching all things livingâevermore!â But how accomplish my transcendant aims!â Men will not e'en believe in such a moodâ Of high, disinterested, and fervent feeling!â St!âsteps approach!âit is my friend at last. Enter Guicciardini. Thrice welcomeâBrother of my heart!âDost bear Good tidings!âYes!âthey are written on thy brow! Gui. Aye! thou art to have an audience of the Duke, Dear Friend, at noonâand I rejoice to add, Our honoured Master speaks of you with more Than even his wonted graciousnessâand dwells With much delight upon the prospect thus, Of soon beholding you:âbut yesternight He said to Cesare he doubted not You could at once most fully clear yourself From every villainous imputation now; But added, that was needless, since himself Was of your perfect innocence convincedâ Then blamed himself even bitterly, that he Had ever lent an ear to those who sought To poison friendship with Suspicion's venom!â Be in the Palace-Vestibule at noon!â Al. Most gladlyâand these tidings, well believe, Are dear and welcome to my long-grieved Soul, As draughts in deserts to the thirst-scorched pilgrim!â But sayâhast thou no other tidings?ânone Connected with a subject dearer still?â Thou surely knowestâthou must know, what I fain Would hear, yet hardly dare to ask!â Gui. 'Tis true! Though yet thou hast never openly discoursed With me on that dear subject, I have long Gazed on thy Soul, and its deep secret read!â 'Tis a most chrystal and most lucid shrine, That generous Soulâand can but ill conceal!â Why! all thy thoughts are bright transparencies, And all thy Being beams and burns with truth!â Thou lov'st Costanza!â Al. Blessings on thy tongueâ For these sweet soundsâall blessings!âWell hast thou Mine whole Soul spoken in those few rich words! Thou hold'st the mirror up unto my Heart!â And Oh! how beautiful that finds itselfâ Robed in the lustres of this glorious love!â And hast no tidings of her?âspeakâat leastâ Tell me she loves no other!âholds her health!â Say, she doth move right queenly as her wontâ Blooms in the pride of all her loveliness!â Keeps the sweet silv'ry clearness of her voice?â Tell me she seems to all men as to meâ The glory and the wonder of the world!â Still something saddenedâsomething changedânot so!â Yet something showing of an inward changeâ Speaking of soft regrets while I was far. Gui. A truce to questions and such varying onesâ So full of love's obscure perplexitiesâ All that I know is littleâshe hath scarce Appeared in public since you left the placeâ But when she hath, I ever have remarked That she looked palerâgraver, than before!â I saw her last yestreen, for five brief minutes. Al. How!âwhat!âyestreen!âOh! how I envy thee!â Her Uncle!âwhat of him?âhe hates me muchâ And wishesâI am well convincedâhis niece Should marry with Lorenzo!âme he hates, For my ambition clashing with his ownâ As he imaginesâthough it doth not thus!â But he abhors me bitterly!â'tis strangeâ And yet scarce strangeâbecause I surely know The clue that guides me right unto the cause!â My Motherâwherefore she hath ne'er explainedâ Commanded me on my arrival here, (Under the seal of secresy I speak,) To thwart the Count in various aims and schemes. My Mother's words are laws unto my willâ And should be so!âfor her exceeding love Hath ofttimes left me marvelling at its might!â 'Tis all but madness of idolatry!â It weighs her down as 'twere a very sorrow!â Be certain I obeyed her slightest wish, Laid out my conduct by her plan prescribed, And baulked the Count some several timesâalas!â Succeeding in the schemes wherein he failed; I fear he ne'er will sanction now my suitâ His temper is resentful, harsh and stern;â I have but little hope!â Gui. Take heart!âdear Friend!â Fear not the Count!âthe gracious Duke designs To shower fresh honours on youâand to show In every way that lieth in his power Your reinstatement in his favour nowâ To him confide your love for fair Costanza,â He will compel her uncle to consentâ His vain reluctance crushâand crown your hopes! Al. No! Guicciardini!âwell I knowâtoo wellâ Costanza never would be happyâneverâ If her loved Uncle did not freely give His full consent and cordial countenance Unto our nuptialsâand I could not beâ I never could be happy were She not so! I would not throw a shadow o'er that Heartâ I would not see a cloud upon my Heaven!â No!âGuicciardiniâNo!âthis must not be!â 'Twould kill our happiness in grasping it!â As children crush the Summer's rainbowed Queenâ The o'er-blazoned Butterflyâby snatching sharplyâ In their too rash and inconsiderate grasp!â I may not do it!âGuicciardini!âNO! But oh! my Friend, my Friend!âmust I indeed Resign my hopes of her, which even to build, Made me too heavenly-happy!âShe is all Angels might wish in new-ascended Spirits!â Too beautiful for Earthâtoo young for Heaven! The very Tuscan on her lips of loveâ Doth languish sweetly to a tenderer musicâ Oh! she is a Creation! Beauty ne'er Was made before her making!âMan but dreamed What Nature had designed, but ne'er performedâ Till Beauty sprang like Light upon the scene, And on the Sight and Soul, in her rare Form, And taught the Sun to shine!â Gui. Nay! spare me! spare!â A Lover's rhapsodies are most enchantingâ Delightfulâwiseâperspicuousâto himselfâ But apt on other's ears to fall too flatâ And prove a little puzzling!âI agree In all that you observed some short time back While gleamed a lucid interval;âand now Come with me homewardsâfor the streets I doubt Will soon be thronged, and for your private ear I have revealments relative to all That passed, ere your most cruel banishment From this fair Cityânot from our true loves!â I can enlighten you on various pointsâ And show you whom to trust, and whom to shunâ A painful knowledge, but a needful, tooâ The latter much preponderating still!â It is a strange wild worldâbut such as 'tis, We must contrive to live in it!â Al. Lead on!â [Exeunt. Scene II. âA Room in the Marchese di Millaflores' Palace. Millaflores, Crescenzi, and Diodati discovered. Diodati. Ha! ha! rare sport!âwell, Marquess! we but came To ask you sage advice upon this pointâ And since you think the Duke would be displeased At our appearing at the Festa clad In masquerading dress, we will refrain; You are the pink of courtiers, and know best!â For my part, I confess, I wished to speak Some few home-truths to those whom I well know Had injured secretly my noble Friend, The young Algarvesâand, you know, 'tis still Permitted under sanction of the mask, To introduce the unfashionable guestâ And stranger to the Courtâcalled Truth!â Milla. Indeed, I beg you will not say I gave adviceâ I counselled nothingâand but just remarked It might be inconvenientâmight occasionâ 'Twere possible, some slight unpleasantnessâ I said, I could not sayâ'twere sage or rightâ And said, I would not say 'twere otherwise. Cres. Oh!âyes!âdear Marquess! thou wert most discreet, But then thou art such an Oracleâthou know'st!â The obscurest hints from thee we snatch and hoard Most carefullyâmost curiously do weigh!â Well! we have now given up the planâbut tell meâ Think you not with us, 'twas a sinful shame, That men who all affected to esteem him,â To whom in his hey-day of favour, he But showed all kindness and cordiality, Should have together plotted, in so base, So villainously base and coldly cruel A manner, to destroy, and blight, and crush The Saviour of their Sovereign's honoured life! To whom from that same unforgotten hour, When he, at great self risk did guard his Princeâ That gracious Sovereign was of course placed under Such weighty obligations!â Milla. As to that, I ne'er could see the obligations yet!â Dio. Thou know'st the fact? Milla. The fact, I know, 'tis true; I well remember this same youth contrived Once on a time, and in a certain Battle, To ward a certain weapon from some part Of the Duke's personâhe, of course, averred A vital partâbut he was no Chirurgeon!â And ill could calculate, it seems to me, The chances of the thrust!â Cres. Well!âlet that pass!â The Duke believed he owed his life to himâ And ever had displayed to his Preserver The warmest gratitudeâtill those masked foesâ Snakes in the grassâbetween them sought to raise The bar of discord. Milla. Noble Count Crescenzi!â 'Tis strange His Highness should conceive he is Beneath an obligation to this youth!â I do repeat, I think it truly strangeâ Allowing e'en the most we can allowâ Admitting all you urge in argumentâ He only saved His Highness' life!âthat's all!â Dio. Why! something of an obligation too!â He only risked his own, to spare his Prince'sâ A trifleâyet to be consideredâheigh? Milla. (warmly.) A most impertinent presumptuous act! A youth like him, without or name, or rank, Or place, or office, near the Royal Person, To meddle thusâall-uninvited too, In things of such importanceâmatters ev'n Connected with the state!âfie!âfie!â'twas treason!â The highest pitch of insolence!âfor me, I marvel how His Highness could vouchsafe To let the Busy-body play a part, For which he was so glaringly unfit. Dio. You would have had him tried at once, no doubt, By stern Court-Martial there, for his dire crimeâ His breach of disciplineâhis misdemeanourâ And daring actâ Milla. Most certainly I should! For I distinctly state, he was unfit For such a part as he presumed to play!â Had he but been a Gentleman in Waitingâ A State Page of the Presenceâor, perchance, An ordinary Medical Attendantâ Or an Extraordinary Leech or Surgeonâ The Private Secretary or the Assistantâ Some young Equerryâor some household-followerâ A guard of the AntechamberâUsherâHeraldâ The case were different;âbut for him to dare To interpose his vulgar person thus, Between the Prince and the Enemy who sought His lifeâwas most preposterously presumptuous!â Faugh! I am sick of thoughts of it, I swear!â Cres. The Prince had sicker been without it, though! Despite your reasoning. Dio. Aye! and I should think His Highness at the moment scarcely wished To wait upon the Gentleman in Waitingâ Till it might suit his leisure to appearâ And guard the sacred person of his Princeâ Or to await in the most mortal straitâ Even the fair presence of a Page of the Presenceâ To gain deliverance from the jaws of Death! Fore Heaven!âI think, had you, good Marquess, been Then in His Highness' place, you had done the same! And from the vulgar hands of the Unknown, Accepted that small trifling boonâyour life!â Milla. You wrong me, Sir!âand let me tell you now, A tale will prove how ill you judge of me. Some twenty years ago, when I was made Ambassador unto the honoured Court Of His high Catholic Majesty of Spain, On our return, a furious storm arose, Threatening the demolition of our bark; 'Twas on a rockâand dangers yawned around. I could not swimâa common sailor came With impudent, officious, rude effrontery, Offering to bear me in his lusty arms!â (Meâme invested with dread officesâ A Personage of ponderous state and weight)!â Dio. By mass, he would have had the worst of it!â Proceed! dear Marquess!â Milla. And proposing thus To snatch me from the perils of that plightâ This I refused with suiting dignityâ What IâIâbe thus piteously preserved? I as myselfâor Iâas the awful Proxyâ As the all-distinguished Representative Of himâthe illustrious Duke!âthe Accreditedâ The Plenipotentiaryâcould I indeed Vouchsafe to be preserved by aught beneath The Captain of the ship!âunhappilyâ The Captain was a sorry swimmer;âwell!â I condescended to imply I would Be graciously pleased in such thwart circumstance To beâfrom Deathâimmediately impendingâ Saved by the first Lieutenantânought beneath That rank assuredly!âby him indeedâ I peradventure might descend to be Kept above waterâfrom the grave upheldâ I might so sink myself, as swim with him!â And favour him by floating through his help. Cres. Oh! the overpowering offer!â'twas sublime!â Nay! most magnanimously memorable!â Milla. I even declared, that if the case should grow Quite desperateâI would flatteringly consent To honour him, by holding to the last!â And if I sunkâwith affability Would deign to drag him with me to the bottom!â And let him drown in my good company!â The great responsibility, perchance, Alarmed him, for he showed himself scarce anxious To share the honours I intended him. It chancedâa friendly vessel aided usâ And came and took our whole full crew on boardâ And I had all the ennobling consciousness Of having well and worthily myself Comported most uncompromisinglyâ A pattern to all Princes, Emperors, Kings,â Ambassadors to foreign Courts, and Envoys, Special or otherwiseâChargÃ©s d'Affaires, Plenipotentiaries, and Internuncios, Grand Dukes, Arch Dukes, Grandees, and Marquesses; Generalissimos and Admirals; Judges and Chancellors and Privy Councillors; Peers and Lord high hereditary Grand Treasurers!â And I feel sure in battle I would die (Could I not be legitimately spared,) Rather than let some low clown save my life!â Or one unknownâunnoticedâand unnamed!â Who boasts no sixteen quarters of his own!â Cres. For my part, when in Battle, I should need But one, methinks!ââGive quarter!âquarter!âHo!ââ And that from the enemy!â Milla. Remember, prayâ Above allâSovereigns should indeed but think Of dread Posterity, and what will say The Subjects of their Great-great-Grandchildren! They should consider but the World!âthe World!â Dio. His Highness didâand wished to stay in it A little longer;ânow it seems to me 'Twas the best compliment that he could pay it!â Milla. He should have thought of what the World would sayâ Have paid more homage to the popular breath!â Cres. Nay! he was right to think first of his ownâ And bargain for that longer breathing spaceâ Oh! most incontrovertibly!â Milla. Indeed, He should have dwelt more on appearances!â Cres. Now it appears to me, the appearance then Of his young brave Deliverer, must have been The most agreeable of all appearances!â Time wearsâgood soothâwe must be goneâbut firstâ Dear Marquessâwilt thou sup with us to-night? (To Dio.) The fellow's so amusing, I must try And make him come!âa partyâsmallâselectâ Pray you say, yes!â Milla. (looking suspiciously.) Why truly!âtruly!âwell!â Inform me with what purportâpray declareâ Now with what motive does your Lordship give This same small supperâheigh? What's in the Wind?â The Object of the Supper?â Cres. Object! none!â Save to appease our hunger sociably! Milla. Nay! People sup not, sure, without strong cause!â That is, I mean, they do not suppers give!â Cres. Why! Friend! you are so suspiciousâ'twas yestreen, You would not walk with a most lovely lady, For fear she entertained some dark design Against your goodâ(now I can swear to you, You were the Entertainer!)âbut indeed, 'Gainst all the laws of gallantryâthus youâ Suspected her!â Milla. I own the impeachmentâyes! That Lady is so full of cunning wilesâ The Lady Fiorilinaâ Dio. Nay, believe You wrong her cruellyâand youâyou knowâ She is ever kind to you!âBut I feel sure You would suspect the Angelsâshould they come And gently hold their bright hands out to you!â You would but think them flatterers like yourselfâ And sidle back from their embrace! Milla. Who? I? Oh! fie! Sir! what!âindeed, you judge me ill! What!âI suspect Their Highnesses!â Dio. Ha! ha!â Yes! Marquess!ânow, you know, you know, you would And even the Archangels if they showed you favour. Milla. I never could so wrong Their Eminencies!â Nay! I would say their Holinesses, or Their Excellent Majestiesâif I am rightâ Their Seats are Thrones!â Cres. Perchance, for Satan nowâ Milla. Hush!âspeak not so abruptly on the suddenâ Thus of his Low Infernal Highness: or, It may be, His High Lowness, orâ Dio. Good troth!â You are rightâa sure Eaves-dropper he must be, Where Courtiers talkâfar likelier I must own, Than the afore-mentioned ones!âWell! we must now Leave you in his good Company! Farewell My pearl of peers!â Milla. Your bounden Slave, Seignors! And truest well-wisherâand lowliest servant. [Exeunt Dio. and Cres. Now I must think on my projected suit To Lady FiorilinaâI must see What chance I have of happiness with her, By studying carefully her pedigree. Poor Soul! her brother told the truth, indeed, When he remarked how kind to me she isâ She never sees me but she smiles!âat timesâ Ev'n laughs outrightâin nervous trepidation, And over-joy!âShe is, it must be owned, Outrageously in love with my appearanceâ Mannerâdeliveryâwalkâand ev'n apparel!â I pity herâbut must applaud her taste! Oh! Millaflores!âthou thrice-dangerous manâ There's not a Grandmother in Florence now, But cries, âBehold him! fifty years ago I might have died of love for such a Beau!â [Exit. Scene III. âA Chamber in the House of Count Lambertazzi. Enter Fiorilina followed by Monna Laura. Laura. I will inform without delay, so please you, Lady Costanza, of your presence here. I know not what, but something late hath chanced Much to disturb and vex herâall the day Her only occupation hath been weeping!â Hard labour tooâand what are its returns, Save swollen red eyes and pallid cheeks? I trow, Tears are like taresâand only run to waste!â Things that sprout merelyâto be thrown awayâ Alack!âalack!â Fio. Well! Monna Laura, haste, And tell your mistress I await her hereâ My task shall be to soothe and to console. Lau. Mine hath been that already; I have tried All consolations, and all comforts too!â 'Tis vain!âI tell her she will surely have To break her heart a dozen times at least, Ere she can hope for aught like happinessâ And then, perhaps, that Happiness will prove A cruel disappointment after all! I tell her all that woman hath before her, Is wrong and blame, desertion and neglectâ That Lovers' hearts change twenty times a dayâ That I can take it on myself to swearâ Not one cares really one half stiver for her!â But strange to sayâshe is not yet consoled. Fio. Pray, Monna Laura, take my message now! I cannot long remain. Lau. I go at once! [Exit Laura. Fio. Alas! ill fitted I must be, I fear, For this nice part of Comforter!âmy heart Is fluttering like a wounded bird within, Wounded and dying!âshall I own the truth? Shall I disclose my weakness and my woeâ The secret of my Soulâso long suppressed! So long locked like a treasure in a grave?â Shall I unfold my Grief unto her Griefâ Give her the first and best of consolationsâ Complete and finely-feeling sympathyâ I cannotâno! I cannot!â Enter Costanza. Cos. Thou art here!â Kindest and dearest!âI am sad thou'rt comeâ I shall but cloud thy joyous spirits o'erâ And send thee back all beggared of thy smilesâ Thy gay, light fancies, and thy peace and gladnessâ Thou canst not see my bitter grief unmovedâ And bitter grief and I no more can part!â Fio. Explain thyself!âI tremble!âhast thou seen The young Algarves?âseems he changed? Cos. Ah! no!â I have not seen him;âwould I never had!â But Oh!âsweet Fiorilina!âpity me! My Uncle, almost grown a tyrant now, Urges with vehemence and sternness ev'n, My union with Lorenzo!â Fio. (Aside.) Oh! my heart!â Die on the thought!âOh! misery!âOh! despair!â (Aloud.)Thou wilt not yieldâthou wilt notâcanst notâNo!â Not sacrifice Algarves and thyself!â Cos. Alas! I fearâI deeply fearâI mustâ I know not what to doâmy Uncle seems Determinedâmost unbendingâall his hopes He cries are centred in this project nowâ How can I brave him?âhow can I refuse To serve his wishes, who hath watched all mine From infancy?âHowâhow can I avoid Submission and obedience?âShall I change Compliance suddenly to bold defiance? I must obey his bidding!â Fio. Thou must not!â No! thou must not do thus!âIt cannot be Thy dutyâand it is not!âNo!âOh!âno!â Thou wilt notâcanst notâshalt notâthus at onceâ Thus at one blowâwith one breathâsacrifice Algarves and thyself andâme!âaye!âme!â Cos. Thee!âFiorilina!âin thy turn explain!â What mean'st thou?âI am most perplexedâconfusedâ Can it be then thou lov'st Lorenzo? speak!â Fio. Can this be?âcan it!âOh! Costanza! know, None ever loved so fervently and deeply!â Long have I struggled with myselfâin vainâ The fiery struggles made the Feelings mightierâ Like very Wrestlers they increased their strength, By each distracting conflict that they foughtâ (Alas! not so with Reason's faint suggestions!) And now their might indeed hath mastered mine! Cos. My thought returns not from its great surprise!â Thou lov'st!âand lov'st Lorenzo!âthou art conquered!â Thou! who hast still defied that Passion's power!â I thank thee! Fiorilina! thank thee much!â Bless thee for this confession!âthou hast given A double motive to my doubtful mind!â Another reason for my strong refusal!â I thank theeâthank theeâFiorilina dear!â And can it be indeed?âthis is most strange!â I never should have guessedâne'er dreamed of this!â But rather far,âbeholding in his joy, The bold glad lark upspringing to the sun, Should I have fancied that he soared in sadnessâ Have deemed he bore within his throbbing breast The fabled thorn that wounds the nightingale, Than that thy heart contained the fatal shaft!â The empoisoned mischief Love is strong to speedâ Contained it and concealedâfor 'twas concealed Beneath a mask of sprightliest merriment!â Well framed of thousand smiles and laughters still!â I marvel yet and ever!â Fio. This surprise, Surprises me!âI scarcely could believe I had so well succeeded to my wish!â And hid the hoards of feeling at my heart!â But 'twas well done!â Cos. Nay, dearest!âI do think Thou hast deceived thyselfâit may not be!â It cannot be thou lov'st so deeply wellâ Yet hast so well subduedâso well suppressedâ All outward signs of that which wrought within!â Thou dost not love!â Fio. Not love!âOh! make that true, And I will bless and thank thee as thou hast thanked me!â Not love!âhear that!âmy beating, bounding heart!â And live one moment on thy fancied freedom!â Too much we judge of others by ourselves!â Thy gentle spirit crushed beneath the weightâ Clings for support to the oak of others' strengthâ An over-loaded and faint-trailing vineâ So thou'rt sustainedâby shadowing sympathyâ And deem'st that others must be propped like thee!â Mine bears its mighty burthen by itself!â Clothed round with secresyâwith silence mailedâ The very stir and strife and storm within, Of my wild Passion's might, support my soulâ A storm of triumphâand a strife of fervourâ My fiery Spirit sitteth in the Sun!â And sees the Stars burn round it evermore!â It revels in its own intenseness still!â It glories in the trouble of its zeal!â Thou think'st thou lov'st,âI tell theeâand 'tis truth, Thy love is cold as subterraneous springs To mineâCostanza!âdeepâbut not so high!â Thine is a shadow to the light of mineâ Thine is a shrinking love!âit dares not soar!â It sits i' the dust and worshippeth!âMine flies!â Mounts Heaven still after Heaven, to sink, indeed, To Earth at length!âand own that the aÃ«riest height, Is less supreme than that sublime abasementâ Less glorious than that fall beneath his feet!â For 'tis beneath his feet it sinks at last!â Cos. Disparage not thy poor Costanza's love!â Thou ownest that fall yet nobler than the flight!â Ah! doubt not that the love that dwells girt round, For ever with a touching lowliness, Is strong and great, and brightâand fresh and true,â As that which swells with mountainous up-towerings!â What if it soars not to the ethereal copeâ It brings the Stars down to its place of prideâ For every thought seems Constellation-crownedâ And all self-honoured its Humilities!â And I am proud since I have loved so wellâ Proudâhigh above the Angels!âand the lowerâ The lowerâthat thus I sink in fathomless Feelingâ The loftier is my Triumph and my Trust! No crowd-encircled Conqueror wheeled in gold, And smothering dust of glory, with his name Sent to the Sun in Heaven, from thousand throats That play obsequiously the trumpets' partsâ Surrounded with whole nations of adorersâ Supplanting cymbals with their loud-clapped handsâ And startling Heaven as with Earth-thunderings, thereâ Ere felt the tithe of the overpowering raptureâ The happy haughtinessâHeart-gratulationâ Delectable deliriousness of triumphâ That I do feel in Love's bright Sovereign Slavery!â Oh! proud am Iâwhen trembling from his tongueâ Comes some slight word that speaketh in my praiseâ More by its toneâthan turn of phrase and languageâ Or when a love-light look emblazeth allâ My Being from his rapture-beaming eye!â Fio. My Heart's dear sister!âmore my sister now!â Cos. I hug my bright Humility!âwould hurlâ All glories and all greatnesses of Earthâ From my free Passion-Empired Spirit's sphereâ Smile back the swayâruleâmasterdomâof worldsâ With all the Empurpled Sumptuousness of prideâ From my Horizon that is all of Heaven! August is such an abjectness of Heartâ Sublime is such a proud submissivenessâ Be all my ornaments his looks of love!â My treasuresâhis dear thoughtsâmy Worldâhis Presence!â Alas! the annihilation of this absence!â Fio. Thou lov'st!âthou lov'st!âI will not sayâlike meâ Still well and worthily thou lovest!âBut ever New thoughts do crowd and hurry on my Soul, In gorgeous and supreme assemblages!â They dazzle me from mine own Selfâso glorious! Such purple-proud processions through the mind!â Such bright array still opening in fresh triumphs! For thus my Love still speaks in Showers of Sunbeamsâ My Spirit trembles with surprise!â Cos. Ah! say!â Dost thou remember, Fiorilina, when Thy maiden diedâ'twas saidâdied broken-heartedâ Her lover having faithless provedâand falseâ (Then little knew we of Love's treacherous powerâ And much perplexed, we wondered while we wailed!)â Rememberest thouâwe saw her in her shroud? Her blind, yet blandest aspect, made the Soul Drink deep of Death!âAye! into all its life!â Even unto all its everlastingness!â Till drunken with his heavy slumberous strengthâ And solemn sweetness?â Fio. I remember well!â Cos. Oh! FiorilinaâI could wish, methinks, Even now to sleep the same dark heavenly sleep, And 'scape Love's restless hopes, and racking joysâ For ev'n Love's joys are troubled to their depth!â Oh! Royalty of dear Repose!âOh! Death!â Nurse thou this sick and most tired childâmy Soulâ That asks thy comfortable carefulnessâ And pines for peace!â Fio. Speak not so sadly, thou!â Thou art beloved!âfor me!âI fear!âI fear!â Yet scarce find courage to approach that thought!â Oh! I remember well the faint blind smileâ (For she did smile in death!)âthat maiden woreâ Lost Ginevra!âand I do deeply feel The wearers of such smiles are blessed indeed!â But let us not in vain thus lingering hangâ (Two sister-sorrowsâpartners in our painâ) In sad companionship of memories mournfulâ O'er by-gone daysâwe must arise to act And striveâ Cos. And suffer!âOh! I fain would draw Ten thousand thoughts and dreamings from the Pastâ From Truth or Fiction, to o'er-swayâo'er-shadow, And mantle up the one dire feeling, housed Within my Heart of Heartsâmy heavy lot Must be, to yield up life and love and hope, Or grieve my FatherâGuardianâFriendâ Fio. Nay! hush!â Thy choice is madeâ'twere madnessâmorbid madnessâ To doubt thy clear self-duty on this point! And thou hast confessed to me, ere this, the thought Of marrying with Lorenzoâto thy Soulâ Is loathsomeâterrible! Cos. I own it!âyes!â And yet 'tis strange, the excess of shrinking horror With which this thought doth fill me,âsince, indeed, Far from misliking himâI have ever felt The tenderest warmth of friendship toward the youthâ E'en singularly so. Fio. The cause is plain!â Thou lov'st Alphonzoâand Lorenzo stands Between thyself and him. Cos. It must be soâ I trustâI trust that he is not made wretched!â The thought is very painful to my Heartâ Thou must console himâthou must make his blissâ I would not be the cause of Grief and Sorrowâ Oh! have I e'er given pain?âI would not do so! No! I would rather die than be the cause Of Pain to others!âif we thus give painâ We know not well how it affects and shakes themâ We know notâcannot dream what fibres fineâ May thrill through all their being!ânor may guess The sum of their veiled Sufferance!âfor ourselves We know what we do sufferâbut 'tis sure A fearful thing to grieve another's Heart! To set up Pain to rule another's Soul! We know not where it ends, nor where beginsâ Nor its commencings nor concludings mark!â It may be cause of thoughts of strange distrustsâ Of rankling feelingsâhatredsâdiscontentsâ Distemperaturesâand maladies of mindâ And loss of all the good and bliss of earthâ Nay! Hopes of Heaven!âAh! let me ne'er give Pain Enter Count Lambertazzi. Lam. The gentle Lady Fiorilina here!â Nay, then I guess the talk hath surely been Of trimmings and of taffetas, wherewith You will together outshine all besideâ That may be bidden to the Ducal Festaâ And make half Florence blind.â Fio. Stone-blind with beauty.â Yea!âand stark-mad with love!âI leave you nowâ Most dear Costanza, for my Brother waits For me to choose between two beauteous gemsâ To loop the sleeves up of my new-wrought robeâ There is a question too I must decide, Between a carkanet of Chalcedoines And one of paly pearls. [Exit Fio. Lam. Now speak at onceâ My Child!âmy Child!âhast thou considered well?â Wilt give thy dutifulâmost dear consent To my most deep and darling wish? Cos. Alas! Forgive this guilty heart, that cannot teach Its every pulse and property and powerâ To answer to thy lightest wish revealedâ Or with a surer instinct to respond To thoseâyet uncommunicatedâhiddenâ Lam. Thy words, Costanza, are most kind,âbut yet Kind deeds and dutiful would please me more; Wilt thou espouse Lorenzo?â Cos. Oh!âno!âno!â Oh! never!âno!âI cannot!ânever!âno!â That answer pealeth from my deepest Soul!â My thoughts find Voices to cry outâNo! never!â All that is me becomes a Voice to send That answer back, and shudders intoâNo! Lam. Lov'st thou another?â Cos. Oh! forgive me! nay!â Lam. Dost love none other?â Cos. Pity me, I pray thee! Lam. Thou lov'st another!â Cos. Pity me, and pardon!â Lam. Confess thou lovestâthou lovest!â Cos. Peace!âhush! no more!â Lam. Whom lov'st thou?â Cos. No!âI cannot speakâI chokeâ I know, I know thou lov'st him not!ânot so!â I speak wild words,âI heed not what I say!â Lam. (Aside.) The horrid truth stares out to me, great Heaven!â She loves him I detest!âthe abhorred Algarves!â Ere this hath she unto my watchful ear Let fall dark words confirming my suspicions!â Most wretched Lambertazzi!âevery hope Was centred here, in this Beloved One! My whole Life darkens into disappointment! Beyond that hope smiled no Horizonânone!â (Aloud.)Costanza!âI will leave thee to reflectâ Since I would urge thee to reflect awhile, Ere yet thy full entire refusal doomsâ My Life to wrecks of wretchedness and ruin! [Exit Lam. Cos. Right bitterly have I the heart-ache now! To deadliness of dreary-sick despairâ Aching and achingâall my sides will burst!â Yes! Grief is ripeâripe now:âand 'twill not bear To be enclosed in such a little mould,â 'Twill break its way through, and fill all the Worldâ Smother the Sun, and stifle up the Skies!â And shroud the bright Stars in their heights of calmâ Till Darkness frowns his chaos o'er creation!â Come! thou tremendous Desolation!âDeath!â For I am tortured by this tyrant, Lifeâ And fain would sleep my crushing cares away!â [Exit. Scene IV. âApartment in the Grand Ducal Palace, brilliantly illuminated. Several Guests and Courtiers are standing about. Enter the Marchese de Millaflores, Crescenzi, Diodati, and Lorenzo. Milla. Not yet our Sun of Royalty has risen. Cres. But thou shin'st like a comet to console us, With thy fine train of rare particular courtiers. Loren. Methinks, dear Marquess, thou must meditate Some dire heart-murder this same nightâthy dressâ Thine airâall threaten Execution's worst!â Dio. My poor, poor Sister!âwretched, hapless victim!â I marvel much why she delays so longâ Myself will go and seek her, and prepare For these soft dangers, she must strive to meet!â [Exit laughing. Cres. Propose yourself, to-night, dear Marquess, prayâ Believe me, you were bestâfor I have heard Bad newsâmost heavy newsâI grieve to sayâ Dark hints of Count Giordano's fond intentions! I fear me, he will yet your rival prove! For I am told the fair one would espouse him!â 'Tis true, she reigns not solely in his love; His Heart, I ween, is full of little holes As any venerable Pincushion, (Worn out in its profession of Utilityâ) That does its duty by the land it lives inâ Or as your own old tattered TapestriesâMarquess!â I am your pledge for thatâbut much I fear, Lest she should give her snow-white hand to him!â Milla. Him!âwhat!âa simple Count!âIf she indeed Would marry him, she must of course, no doubt, Wed me a thousand times more joyfullyâ Who moveâa Marquess!âso I thank you, Sir!â For what you style bad news: you see 'tis plain If she would willingly a Countess proveâ Assuredly a Marchioness she must Become, with thrice the pleasureâthat is clear!â But deep considerations must be mine, And anxious ponderingsâI would know the worthâ The sound real worthâthe excellence and goodnessâ Cres. Be very sure her Heart's a mine of wealth!â Milla. Her Heart!âwhyâno! Her House I am thinking ofâ ('Tis of importance far more vital surely!)â The noble House and Name of the Diodati!â Cres. Ha!âHa!âbut then if Hearts should not be joinedâ Milla. They seldom are, I thinkâin Heraldry!â Hands gauntletted, I doubt, I have seen thus!â And if my memory serves meâI have seenâ Yes! yes!âI recollect a crest approvedâ A handâclose mailedâand clutched within its hold, A sheathless daggerâbut a HeartâOh! never!â Not once in crests or coatsâno! never!âno!â A bleeding Heart'sâa very poor Pretence!â Well! I must think most seriously and deeplyâ I must examine first her pedigreeâ Must weigh her meritsâknow if she is pure!â Cres. Pure!âwhy no angelâ Milla. Hush! Sir!âI do meanâ In her descentâthe other's less importantâ And common in comparisonâbe sure!â Most difficult it isâ'tis very hardâ To find a wifeâto find a wifeâI sayâ Right worthy of one's arms!â Cres. Well!âis she not All loveliness?âa Sultan e'en might sigh To call such matchless Beauteousness his own! Milla. Sir!âI do mean Heraldic ArmsâI pray Conceive my meaning betterâthis besides, My duty 'tis to choose a peerless wifeâ Replete with rare perfectionsâheaped with honoursâ In short, one worthyâworthy every way (When that the fulness of the time is comeâ) To sleep withâall my stately Ancestors!â Loren. Ha! ha! good Marquess!âwell I know your thoughts Are ever running on your funeral Vaultâ But I much doubt your youthful spouseâ Milla. My Vault!â It hath no equal in all Christendomâ Kings might resign their thrones for such a tomb!â I do propose to give there,âsome fair day, A small select Assembly, for the purpose Of well examining the various coffinsâ I beg to invite youâ'twill be gay and pleasant!â (Indeed, I think of opening some half-dozenâ) Admiringâ Loren. Hush!âfair Fiorilina comesâ And with her comes the unmatched Costanza tooâ Now making night so precious with her Beauty, That we might doubt if e'er the out-lustred Sunâ Durst rise againâor be in risingânoticed!â Enter Fiorilina, Costanza, Diodati, and Lambertazzi; the latter walks thoughtfully apart. Milla. (to Fio.) Sweet Lady, might I pray awhile even now Thy kind attention?âShe heeds notâAhem!â Fio. (to Cos.) Oh! save me! could'st thou know how much my heart Forswears its firmnessâand forsakes itselfâ Cos. (to Fio.) I save thee!âwho am weaker far!â Milla. Sweet Dameâ Most rare PerfectionâI would fain discourse To thee awhile, on a most pleasing subjectâ Thy lovely looks remind me forciblyâ Of the epitaph in my funereal vaultâ Which saithâ Fio. I pray your pardon, Sir,âconsult My Brother here on the old inscription's merits!â Milla. Nay! Madam! Madam! (Fio. walks with Cos. away.) She misunderstands meâ Well! well!â'tis better this should be deferredâ I might have compromised myself too soonâ Once fell I in great danger!â Cres. How? Milla. Ev'n thusâ I had made, partly made, proposals grave To Countess Biancaâwhen I heard there was A deep, dire, stainâ Cres. Upon her character!â Milla. Worseâher EscutcheonâI at once retreated;â Lady Olympia then I soughtâan Heiressâ Herself was perfect, but I found 'twas rumouredâ Her Great Maternal Aunt was rather doubtfulâ A Capulet,âwhose Cousin at Verona Had had a Step-son, who had had a Nephew That married with an onion merchant's Niece!â Long could I dwell on the Attractions bright Held out by fair Leonora dell' Orsiniâ I was profound in tenderest admirationâ For that sweet Lady's Great-great-Grandfather!â A worthy Noblemanâwho held discreetlyâ Most of the offices about the Court!â But then, her Mother had plebeian ancles! (Voices without.) Way! way there! for His Highness! way! the Duke! Enter the Grand Duke, Princess Beatrice, Count Giordano, &amp;c. Guests crowd round. G. Duke. A bright assemblage!âwelcome, welcome all!â My Halls will be filled gladly and most worthily With your fair merriments!âI pray ye nowâ To your diversions!âbid the music soundâ Beseech yeâseek ye all your mirth and pleasures,â Our hospitalities are honoured mostâ By those who most shall seize them, and enjoy!â Be welcome, fair Costanza, here!âwith thee I mark thy young Venetian Friendâthe bright And beauteous Daughter of Prince Diodati!â Let our fair Florentines look to it well! Sweet Lady! thou'rt a dangerous rival, faithâ And wilt bear back with thee the Hearts of half Our Youthful Intrepidities of Florence!â Fio. Your Highness flatters with so good a grace, That truth henceforth shall most distasteful seem. Princess Bea. Our dear Costanza!â'tis an age of time Since thou hast shone forth at masquerade or festaâ What happy change hath brought thee out to-night? Cos. Nay, Madam, when the Gracious Duke commands Our duteous presence,âwho but would obey? G. Duke. To your Diversions!âDamesâand Cavalieri!â [The Duke and Princess retire. Lam. (to Gior.) Where tarries young Algarves?âhe is lateâ He and his fast sworn friendâthe Guicciardini. Gior. Algarves has been closeted long hours In closest conference with the gracious Dukeâ He hath indeed but lately left the Palace To change his garb, ere he shall re-appear In this gay galaxy of pomp and beautyâ A new appointment is bestowed upon himâ And, as I hear, his friend, the Guicciardini, Will be associated in this employ, By his desire and earnest-warm entreaty. Lam. A worthy couplet!âtwo green, crude, young brains! Now shall we soon have war again be sureâ The fiery heart of young Algarves ne'er Can brook this pause of Peaceâand mark my wordsâ It will not last!âhis restless flames of Soul Wave with each breathâfast scattering sparks of strife All round their place of perilous Occupation! Gior. I know not!âbut observeâthe friends approach. Enter Algarves and Guicciardini. Lam. Avoid them!âI would further speak with thee.â [They retire. Al. Behold her in the distance!âmore than lovely!â In Boundlessness of Beautyâthere she stands!â Methought her eye caught mineâit surely doth!â My long chilled life glows ripening in that ray!â Two souls I see there,âtwo in those deep eyesâ Hers and mine own!âNo! no! they melt to one!â My Mind seems spangling out as with all Starsâ So bright my thoughts become with blessednessâ But thou, my Friendâthou'rt grave and sad-sedateâ Whom seeks thine eyeâwith such a mournful keenness?â Gui. The secret of thy HeartâI pierced and readâ My Soul at once shot through its winding depthsâ And flashed the clouds awayâbut I must light Those little fluttering, twinkling lampsâdull wordsâ To lead thee through the darkness of mine ownâ Mine eyes seek her whom all my thoughts adoreâ The Princess Beatrice!â Al. Hah! is't so!â I ne'er imagined thisâand hast thou hope?â Gui. The Hope to love her to my latest breathâ And love in undiscovered silent sorrow!â Al. Fie on't! nay! have a better courageâcomeâ The gallant Guicciardini well might hope!â But hist! Costanzaâor the Sun draws nighâ For dazzled droops mine o'er-illumined eye! Gui. Speak! speak to her!âshe tremblesâscarce her friend, Fair Fiorilina, can support her steps!â Al. I know notâif in absenceâfairest Ladyâ I have been beggared of deep affluenceâsuch As should make Monarchs richerâricher farâ Namelyâthe lightest scatterings of your thoughts?â Cos. Receive my welcome back to Florence, Sirâ (Aside.)Speak, Fiorilina, for my voice is dead!â Fio. And mine, fair Sir! we are both rejoiced to see Oneâlong, much missed, restored to us again. Al. (Aside to Cos.) Wilt thou not speak then, Lady?âsave, those few Close-measured words of formal friendliness!â One momentâand one little step apart? [She walks with him aside. Oh! sweet Costanza! though with words before I never dared unshroud my Soul to thineâ Did looksâdid actions not enough reveal Of the ecstasy of Love I felt for thee? And dared I hope too madly, when I hoped Thou wert not all impassiveâall indifferent?â Cos. I ne'er yet gave you cause, Sir, to assume That I in any way was otherwiseâ I might notâand I could not give you causeâ Al. Thou say'st it!âmust this be?âthen I have beenâ Most miserably mistakenâthere is all!â Cos. (Aside.) And I more miserably misunderstood!â Al. Farewell! sweet Lady!â Cos. What!âthou art going, Sir?â Nay! go not yetâthe revel's scarce begun. Al. Oh! this is torture!âhast thou not denied The slightest interest in my blighted fateâ The faintest sympathyâand talk'st of revels?â The broken heart a sorry reveller seems!â Cos. (timidly.) How say'st thou I denied thee?â Al. (passionately.) How said'st thou?â Crush out my Heart, but do not play with it!â Martyr me! murder me! but do not mock me!â Thou didst deny me every gleam of hope!â Cos. I did deny thee!âNo!â Al. Thou didst! Cos. Oh!âbrave!â Tell me again!â(Aside.) I may feel proud to beâ So high a Heroine of the Heart!â Al. Alas! What mean'st thou?âspare the wretch thou'st made so! spareâ Costanza! cruel one!âthou could'st deny me!â Cos. I could?âI could?âOh Heaven!â Al. Once moreâreply!â Didst thou deny me!âdost thou!â Cos. I have done it!â Yes! I have done it!âyes! thou say'st it!â Al.

Most gentle Lady, canst inform me pray If Lady Fiorilina's Mother spelt Her Maiden name with two L's, or with one?â 'Tis of the last importance to my peace!â Al. (Aside.) Plague take this meddling mischief of a Marquessâ This most pestiferous and preposterous fool!â [Lambertazzi approaches them. Lam. Dear Marquess! thou'rt the pink of Courtiers ever! Wilt thou conduct my fair Costanza henceâ To where she better can behold the dance, Since loth she seems to join it yet. (Angrily to Algarves,) Seignor, Your services I humbly beg to acknowledgeâ And yet more humbly, pray to be allowed Entirely to dispense with. Al. (Carelessly.) As you will, My singular good Lord!âall lovely dames Have ever found me, 'mid the Court Cavalieri, Most loyal-zealous in their happy service!â When such is needed notâI can refrain!â How fair our Princess Beatrice looks!â How well that coronet becomes her head!â (Aside.)And fairly smiles she on my noble friend!â And gladdening glows my Guicciardini's brow!â Enter Inez veiled. Milla. By Stars and Orders! But whom have we here? Lam. (Aside.) Heavens! my Heart thrills; how Spanish looks that form! More!âmore!âhow like the graceful statelinessâ Of the Estremaduran's whom I loved andâlost!â [Inez approaches, and signs to Lambertazzi. Al. (Aside.) How like my Mother's form!âhow like her step! (Aloud.)Good Seignor Countâthis masquerading Fair Appears to have communications secret For your especial ear;âLord Marquess!âcome! 'Twere best we joined the jocund revellers yonder. [They walk up the stage. Inez. Count Lambertazzi!â Lam. Ministers of Grace!â Good Guardian Angels!âis it Her indeed!â Inez. (Aside.) Ay di mÃ­, ay di mÃ­,âonce more I see him! (Aloud.)Remember'st thou the unhappiest, and most faultyâ The sacrificed and ruined Inez?â Lam. Aye!â Inez. Behold her trusted, tried, first, last of friendsâ Estrella di Monaco!â Lam. Well! oh! well! Do I remember, on lost Inez' lipsâ That name in tenderest repetition dwelling!â Yes! she would weep and call upon that name, As sinners and as sufferers on their Saints!â Inez. She called on that in death, and not in vain!â But listenâI have words to speak to thee That must not here be interruptedâhist!â I cannot long remainânor must thou seek In any way to penetrate and pierce The mystery, which 'tis needful I maintain.

Heigh!âbustle! bustle!âho! despatch!âI sayâ I hear His Highness peremptory for supper!â (Aside.)I know they are all ranged at their proper posts, But it behoves me make a stir and rout, To seem most sedulous in service still.

And hast thou spoken with him?âtell me promptlyâ Oh! tell me how thou hast sped! my aching heart Would seek repose in the anchored Peace of thine!â Cos. Oh! Fiorilina!âI have pained and grieved him!â I knew scarce what I saidâscarce know I now!â Yet something vague, perplexed, and fraught with meaning, Most adverse from my feelings and intentions!â Fio. Nay!âwherefore didst thou thus?â Cos. I cannot tell!â Oh! Fiorilina!âI can tell thee not!â I am a Fool when he does talk to meâ And have no understanding!âOh! my Friend! Still, still so much of him I thinkâhis words Fall senseless all, and substancelessâfor meâ I cannot apprehend themânor give answer!â Though with my fullest Soul I hang on them!â His look doth kill me like the basilisk's! His Presence is delicious death to me!â And I am notâwhen he is near my Soul!â His Voice!âalas! so mighty is the echoâ That peals deep, deep within my listening heartâ The sense of what he says is all confusedâ 'Tis left behind and lapsedâand lost and lavishedâ From my adoring, yearning wish concealedâ I am a fool when he does speak with me!â Fio. Poor child!âthine over-love doth crush thy spirit!â This well can I conceive!âthough still I strive With desperate struggles to affect the show Of independence and indifference cold, When with Lorenzo I must hold discourseâ The while, my suffocating soul is lost In uttermost emotion!âsee! they comeâ Lorenzo tooâI cannot stay with thee!â [Exit Fio. (Lorenzo, Guicciardini, and Algarves approach. Lorenzo talks in dumb show to Cos., who seems turning away.) Al. Oh! Heavens! the agony of this suspense!â At times, my heart believes itself most blessed, And bounds away in raptured riotous bliss!â Then in one moment it despairsâand drives Its sweet dreams backâas they were mocking fiends!â Gui. Ah! map not out for me Love's various worldâ Too wellâtoo wellâthis deep-struck bosom knows By heart the whole Geography of Passion!â Its Isles of joy midst Oceans of distractionâ Heaven-kissing heights and neighbouring bottomless pitsâ Its smiling continentsâand scowling deserts!â But see! Costanza from Lorenzo turns!â The young Philosopher so grave and mildâ (For as a SchoolsmanâFlorence cannot match him)â Boasts not the skill to charm that youthful Heart!â If I have eyes to read a maiden's Soul, That heart of Gentleness is thine alone!â (Millaflores entering, advances towards them.) Milla. Dear Signor Count Algarvesâfor I know, To-morrow such thy title shall be madeâ I do entreat thee, honour my poor house, By passing there to-morrowâin the even; I have much to show you of surpassing interestâ Old parchmentsâ Al. (turning away coldly from him.) Sir, I much regret, my time, Most fully occupiedâmay scarce admit Of idling visitsâor of gossip-loungings. Milla. (Aside.) So high disdainful!âI am galled at lastâ I would mine Ancestors were here beside me To challenge him and brave!âsince I myself, I own, scarce like that task!âBy Heaven and Earthâ I will have vengeance thoughâdire vengeance too!â Now who is there that hates him?âhush! I have it!â Count Lambertazzi!âgood!âand here he comes!â (Lambertazzi approaches; they whisper together.) Al. Costanza!âdear Costanza! hear me!âhear!â With thy mild graciousness and kindliest favourâ Let me address thy blessednessâthy sweetnessâ Thine everlastingness of gentleness!â Hear me and show me mercy!â Cos. (Aside.) Oh! my Soul! Swoon not so utterly away from meâ Away from him!â(Aloud.) the Countâthe Count!âhe marks usâ His lynx-like eye is on my very Heart!â [Algarves takes her hand. Oh! pray thee loose my hand!â Al. To-morrow, be In thy young Friend'sâfair Fiorilina's houseâ At the hour of noonâ Cos. I dare not answer thee!â Al. But say notâno! Cos. I do not say it!â Al. Bless thee!â (Lambertazzi comes forward, smiles on Algarves; Millaflores follows.) Lam. And what! my child!âart not awearied yet?â Nay! join the dancers with our honoured Friendâ Signor Algarves!â Al. (Aside.) How! what means this change?â [He takes her hand; they pause and walk apart. Milla. His Highness hath retired to rest, methinks. Behoves us be most gratefulâmuch beholden E'en with most ardentâbreathless gratitudeâ To our great Sovereign. Lam. True!âthe FÃªte was gay!â Milla. The FÃªte? yes! yes!âbut then besidesâconsiderâ We are bound to be profoundly grateful, sinceâ With condescension most superlativeâ His Highness deigned to taste of pleasure thusâ With overpowering graciousness, to take The best of everythingâI saw't myself!â Gui. A wondrous act of graciousness, indeed!â Milla. And stooping from his awful height, consented To much amuse himself!âand more than thisâ Be perfectly well satisfiedâand pleasedâ I marked it!âwith his own most royal selfâ And this fair FÃªte he royally devised!â We ought to be o'erwhelmed with obligationsâ (Vast obligations not to be repaid)â I am oppressed with them, and crushed and smothered!â (Aside.)Heaven grant now some one may be listening near, To make report of this my feverish loyalty!â Lam. The revelry is o'er, I 'gin to thinkâ The sounds of cheery music die awayâ The dancers' hurried steps are dumb!â'tis doneâ The sprightliest Hours are still the very saddestâ When thus their sands have ebbed and they are finished!â Algarves!âyet a word with thee!âI pray Accompany awhile our homeward steps;â Count GuicciardiniâI commend me well To your most kind esteem;âCostanza! come!â And thou, good Marquessâpray thee wend with us!â Milla. Assuredly!âyet I should wish to say To-morrow, in His Highness' Audience-Chamber, I saw the tapers outâwith watchful careâ Lest some stray sparkâ Lam. (impatiently.) E'en say it, then!âbut come!â Milla. (musing.) 'Tis possible the Princess' waiting woman May pass this way from fair Beatrice's chamberâ She might report she saw meât'would sound well!â Once, I most providentially was made, On such a bright occasionâas it chancedâ The agent of prompt deliverance for a maiden, Belonging to Her Highness's own suiteâ (I showed much valour tooâand thirst for gloryâ) From the great dread and dangers ofâa Mouse!â Lam.

Nay!âwhat mean'st thou?â Boldâmalapert boy!â Sil. Thy pardon, Lady!âpray theeâ But I was speaking of Rodriquezâ Cos. Mark!â When heâSignor Algarvesâcomesâbe sure To bring him straight into my presence!âstayâ Your Lady is from home?â Sil. Yes! fair Signora!â Cos. I pray observe!âwhen she returneth home, Then make it known to her, that he is hereâ Be sure to make it known to her, I sayâ And to none other!â Sil. All your high commands, Most honoured Ladyâshall be well obeyed!â [Exit Silvio. Cos. Now let me strive to hush my heart to peace!â Must I do battle with thee, Heart?âdown, down!â Heavens!âhow I love!âhow fearfully!âhow fondly!â The tempests of my mighty-rushing thoughts, Strong with the strength of Night and Death, now dash My frail Life to and fro!âbut hush!âhe comes!â Enter Algarves. Al. Oh!âBeautiful!âand art thou here indeed!â How my Heart drinks that maddening aspect now!â Intoxicated with its breathing sweetnessâ My glad Soul bursts its bounds with swelling strengthâ With rapturous and delirious overflow!â And how it loves thee, from its deep of deepsâ To its Heaven-shrouded crowning topmost thought!â My Heart is winged!âmy thoughts all toweringly Mount far beyond their farthest flights beforeâ Aye! ne'er ere this did they exultant spring Thus high-imperiouslyâthus passionate-royally, To sway a world of new-created joy!â Cos. Oh! much I tremble at thy troubled words!â Too wildâtoo fervid!â Al. Tremble not! best loved!â Nay, tremble not!âmy words shall gentlier flow!â Let not thy heavenly Nature be disturbedâ The calm Cerulean of thy mind o'er-clouded!â Stayâsweetest Soul!âstill in thy Spirit-Heaven!â And undescendingâhearken to me!âsince My love, though fiery, though most fervid, grows At thy mild blessed biddingâthy sweet beckâ Saintly and Seraphlikeâas e'en that Soulâ That Soul itselfâwhich all Heaven's Angels love!â But tell me that thou lovest meâsay but that!â Cos. Give me to make mine answer!âif I may!â Oh! there are things which language, taxed and tasked Even to its farthest full triumphant height, With burning rushing eloquence will blazon, And dignify with strange dominion's mastery, And aid to live in Lightnings to the thought, And teach to walk in Victory and in Power, Along the hushedâstilledâsea-like Souls of Men!â And there are things that mock such eloquenceâ That tread its fires to dullest embers down, And leave it barren as a tinkling soundâ And of these last is Love!ânone! none can speak it!â The Immortal Mystery, glorying, spurns expression!â Whose strength expires in efforts void and vainâ Yet would I seek to utter it!âAlas! 'Twere all as well to strive to speak the Sunâ To express in words the Innumerable of Worldsâ To syllable the Immeasurable of Space!â Yet would I something sayâmy mounting Soul Must breathe one momentâbattling try one effort, Though vain!âIt must be vain!âOh! grant me helpâ Make me a World of Words to sayâI love!â Al. Enough!âsweet Soul!âI am made Earth's happiest one!â My Life shall speak my heart's out poured thanksgivingsâ Thou spok'st all spiritually!â Cos.

Speak for meâAngels dear!â Tell him from Heaven how I do love him now!â Or better stillâthyself, Love!âspeak for meâ And give me all my soul!â Al. The Pain of Joy!â Too much!âtoo much!âI did not ask so much!â I am tormented with this happiness! I cannot speak it!âI shall die with it!â Cos. Alas! there is enough to check it!âthinkâ Oh! think, Algarves! what dire bars there be To thwart our mutual Tenderness!â Al. And yet Thine Uncle's manner yesternight was such, As well might give us hopeâ'twas passing strange!â Cos. Oh! promise me that thou wilt nought neglect To win himâplease himâconquer himâat lastâ But promise this!â Al. Thou canst not doubt my wish!â (Aside.)Alas! how all things seem as they conspired Against my peace and precious happiness!â Not only thus doth Lambertazzi's Hate (Strange!âI forgot to read that scroll he gave me!)

I consentâif this may be without Abasement on my part, or weak concessionsâ But much I fearâ'twill prove in vain!â Cos. And now, I pray thee goâI fear, lest he perchance Should follow here my footsteps, as at times It is his wont to doâFarewell!â Al. Oh! Sweet!â Keep me within thy precious Heaven of Heart!â Farewell, and bless thee!â [Exit Algarves. Cos. All my Soul goes with him!â His absence with a pang of anguish thrills me!â The moment he is goneâthe Light seems snatched With painful suddenness from my filmed sight!â The moment he is goneâmy Life is Death!â The blessed Sun is plucked from out the skiesâ The flowers from out the EarthâI sinkâI change!â Yes! yes! my Soul goes with himâfailingâfaintingâ The annihilating Absence is upon me!â Absence from him and from myself at once!â But blessedness to the height of torture late Hath been mine ownâand ev'n its memory still Tosses my Spirit on unquiet seas!â Yet might that happiness have risen still higher!â Could I but dare to look on himâto gaze But half a momentâI were more than blest!â I would give worlds on worlds but once to look, And live in that deep look ten thousand lives!â I dare not!âif I doâI am blind at onceâ Most dazzled and most dizzyâI see nothing!â My Soul flies,âflies out at mine eyes, even then, And breaks as far away as Heaven from Earth!â To lookâwere all the treasures of delight, That crown a Life in one brief instant crowded!â But no! I dare notâcannot gaze on thee!â Thine eyes burn up my thoughts as they look through me, And leave Existence all a desert blank!â But hush! I heard a step!â'tis her! my Friend!â Enter Fiorilina. Fio. Silvio hath told me all, my gentle One!â Oh! thou'rt most happy!â Cos. I am happy!âyes!â I cannot tell thee, nor myself, how blest!â There is not room in all the Universe For my vast heart-deep Happiness and me!â I am afraid of it!âI do cower backâ I tremble and I faulterâand I shrink!â I am too glad!âIf in this World, indeed, Are Graves and MournersâSufferings, Pangs, and Crimesâ Thenâthenâthis should not be!âthe heart should check Such passioned hope's intoxicating transports!â If in this World are Tombs, and Tears, and Sorrows, My Joy unbounded grows an impious thing,â For 'tis the unboundedâth'uncontroulable!â The Earth beams like the Sun beneath my feet!â Rays after rays!âDelirium of Delight!â The riot of this rapture makes me faint!â Oh! Joy!âthou'rt a terrific thing, when Love Doth drive thee thus in whirlwinds through the Soulâ And crowds Amazement, still on sweet Amazementâ At the Ecstacy on Ecstacyâfast hurried Through all the tranced and trembling Spirit's Life!â Give help to bear this Happinessâsweet Saints!â I am all a mounting Madness!âone Delight!â Alas!âa Dream! a Dream!âa dear Illusion!â Reality's cold hand hath touched my Heart, And all the fever of the Feeling's frozenâ A Dream of bliss!â Fio. Nay! yet 'twill be fulfilled!â A proud and happy love is thine, indeed!â Cos. True! true!âand yet my thoughts blush at their fervour!â Yet precious and delicious Shames flow inâ Flow through my soulâand bear it all away Upon their flushing, trembling tides,âand still Conflicting feelings trouble and o'erwhelm me!â Now mounts the great Emotion of my Soul, And spreads itself to mirror back the Sunâ So high-imperious-ostentatiously,â That I would trumpet to the World my passion!â Now shrinks it back upon itself againâ Till I but ask to shroud it and concealâ And sunk in these strange, sweet, and precious shames,â In seas of these delicious dreams and doubtsâ Would hide my Soul even from its Sovereign Lord!â Fio. Hush! hist!âI heard the Count's step on the stair!â Cos. 'Tis him!âkind Fiorilina, leave me now!â Let me alone now meet him in his anger, Or in his gentlenessâHeaven only knows Which o'the twain 'twill be,âmyself can dream notâ But leave me now!â Fio. I go! thy wish shall sway me!â Cos. And dearest! when we meet again, must thou Unfold thy feelings and thy heart to meâ Alas! my selfishness of joy forgot thee!â Fio. And let it still forget meâMe and Sorrow!â [Exit Fio. Cos. Will he again besiege my shuddering ear With pleadings for Lorenzo?â Enter Lambertazzi. Lam. My fair Flower!â Thou hast transplanted thy sweet self betimes Into another's gardenâfar too soonâ Knew'st thou not young Lorenzo was to come?â Cos. Hear meâmy Guardian!âFather!âFriend!âmine All!â I must not longer leave thee in delusionâ If thou indeed dost think I e'er will give This hand unto Lorenzoânever!ânever!â Lam. Hear me too thou!âif thou indeed darest nurse A monstrous Passionâfor this wanderer-youth, The boy Algarves,âtake good heed, I say, Take heed that thou hold'st not to a most vain, Detestable delusion!âbe advised!â Far rather would I see thee dyingâdeadâ Dead at my feetâthan wedded to Alphonzo!â Cos. Despair! despair!âyet wherefore changed thy tone?â Toward him last night, why kindlier breathed thy words?â (Since thou'st discovered thus my secret Soul, Dissimulation were unduteous folly)â Wherefore! oh! wherefore didst thou lend us hope?â Lam. I hadâand have my reasons!âbut bewareâ Nor hint to him what thou hast heard me say!â No soundâno breathâno slightest word I charge yeâ Of mine abhorrence of your union!â Cos. How!â Wouldst have me then deceive him and beguile With false belief thatâ Lam. Silence!âhear and heedâ E'en so I charge thee, in the name of Him Who made theeâlet him think thou shalt be his!â Cos. I cannot!âno!â'twould foully top indeedâ Aye! the infinite of Injury and Injusticeâ 'Twere the uttermost of Cruelty!â Lam. No more!â Be calm! strange steps approach!âbe still!â Enter Diodati and Visconti. Dio. Lord Count!â An old dear Friend of thine who chanced to see Thine entrance here, hath followed thus thy steps, And hastening comes, to give good morrow to theeâ Now let me leave ye to your friendly gossip, To rakings up of good old days and doings, And tramplings down o'the present generation!â Most fair Costanza!âwilt thou see my Sister!â She and her 'broidery-frameâill-matched companionsâ Remain in the inner room,âher diligent tongue Finding strict silence difficult, falls out With this poor passive frame, the which, unable To give reply, is taunted with being sulky!â [Exeunt Cos. and Dio. Vis. I am most anxious, dear old Friend! to know How thou hast sped since this strange youth's returnâ Thy foeâAlgarvesâhast thou heard the news?â The Duke hath e'en this day conferred on him The title of a Count, with lands beside As appanage!â Lam. The black Plague choke him dead!â Alas! Visconti!âin some few brief words Will I relate to thee what hateful things Have passed most strangely and mysteriously,â Such things as have made Life to me a rack Of most perpetual pining agony!â The reason ask me not, but I have cause To think this mushroom-upstartâthis detestedâ This most unutterably despised Intruder, Is Andrea's Son, the long unheard-of Heirâ Mine own lost Nephew!âSilence! on your Soul!â Now and for ever silence! as you love me!â The Miniature that ever was hung round The neck of the infant Heir, with mine own eyes, Yestreen, I saw suspended round the throat Of this new Countâthis same Algarvesâyes!â I cannot doubt it!âIt was whispered me, To try and see this pictureâI succeeded!â Presenting him a secret scroll, and praying That he would read it at some leisure-hour, (The history of which scroll thou yet shalt hear!â) I saw him thrust it in his bosom, thus Opening his vest, which gave the face to view!â Oh! this hath maddened me!â Vis. And I have heard The rumour spreads in Florence, that thy Niece, The sweet Costanza, loves him!â Lam. And thou know'stâ If this is Andrea's Sonâhe is to her No less than Brother!â Vis. Tell her your suspicions!â Lam. Never!â Vis. Yet surely!â Lam. Never! no! my Friend!â I have deep reasons for concealing them!â Nay! stand not thus astonished!âah! thou think'stâ I see what thou dost think!â'tis not soâtrust me!â Thou wrong'st me!â'tis for her!âand I at once These hoards of wealth will yield!âBut come with me!â Come home with meâand then will I unfoldâ Unveil to thee my motives and intentions!â Exeunt.

Is tyrant, or is despot!âsave as made so Even by the unnatural nature now of thingsâ (Become so,âit might seem by long fixed habit)â Their order and officiation now!â Entrammelled by his very trappings e'enâ And all the accompanyings of Sovereignty!â He movesâencumbered and oppressed and straightenedâ As is his meanest subject by his yoke!â Doubt not his Heart beats like our own, and higherâ When once the spell is broken,âand Truth's glassâ That glorious glass is held up to his Soulâ He will become our Partner and Ally, In this great Work of Reformation's rising!â Oh! never doubt!â Al. Couldst thou then think, indeed, Algarves was the friend to despot-sway!â Lam. Aye!âand of warsâoppression of the Peopleâ Profusion of the Courtâand partial lawsâ And grinding impositions!â Al. Hold!âdeclareâ What made thee change that thought thus on the sudden!â Lam. Some words that fell from sweet Costanza's lips, When I reproached her for her love for theeâ The Tyrant-lover, and the People-hater!â Then rushed the Thought upon me thus to make theeâ Even theeâa Brother of our noble Bandâ Long sworn and 'stablished!â Al. How, I pray thee tell, Could Millafloresâthat most grovelling groundling, Become by any meansâso undeservingâ Associated in this vast enterprise, With spirits of aspiring generous natureâ That thingâthat creeping worm!â Lam. The enormous wealth He and his crawling Forefathers have heaped, (Wrung from the People through the Court's connivance,) Make him a valuable assistantâstillâ The Workmen's tools you must not scorn and spurnâ Because nor good nor beauty in themselves They seem to boast!âbut useâapply them wellâ And Good and Beauty shall spring up beneath themâ As flowers beneath the dull grey dropping rain!â Al. My Liege!âmy Friend!âmy kind and kingliest Master!â My good and graciousâgreat and generous Patron!â Swear, with the deepest oaths man ever perilled His inmost Soul in uttering desperatelyâ That his dear life shall be unthreatenedâguardedâ No hair of his most honoured head in dangerâ And that if this our Enterprise succeedsâ The noblest officesâthe highest functionsâ (Which yet remodelled Governments shall suffer,) Shall wait his will, and hang upon his wordâ To be at choice concentred in his personâ Swear!âswear to this by oaths tremendous!âswear!â Lam. By all things Holy, Dreadful, or Adorableâ By all my Hopes of Heaven, and Fears of Hellâ By mine own Soul, and Him who made itâsaved itâ By every Mystery in our hallowed Faithâ And all that solemn isâor great or awfulâ The Sovereign's honoured life is safe from harm, Through any plot, or scheme, or strife of mine!â If we succeed he yet shall bless our efforts!â Al. Enough!â Lam. Now one more wordâthenâbusinessâbusiness!â When all isâas we hopeâin Peace atchievedâ Costanza's love shall crown the crowned Success!â Even as all honours shall rain down on itâ All blessings both from men and angels light it!â Al. Oh! no!âI feelâI fearâI know not what!â But speak thou not of Herânor Blessings!âsayâ Didst tell me this hath long been plannedâdevised?â Lam. Longâlongâand deeply but we needed mostâ A master-spirit to be made our Chief! And such I feel is foundâev'n found in thee!â I marked the towerings of thy kingly Soul Long sinceâbut much misjudged thee, and conceived The unroyal end of thine aspiring dreams Was self-aggrandizementâthe old staleâAmbition!â Now those triumphant towerings wake my thought To loftier zeal;âI know their goal of glory!â (Aside.)How gross a Fool!âbut 'tis a very babe!â His reason's stifled still in swaddling-clothes!â (Aloud.)Now let me urge thee carefully to shun, When Millaflores joins us, aught that he May fairly construe into proud contemptâ He is a foolâa toolâbut vitalâneedful!â Al. Nay! fear me not!âthough I must feel regret, To see such scatter-brains as he, disgracing The slow-built sanctuary of Man's new freedomâ The Holy of Holies of the Watcher-Heart!â Lam. I feel with thee!âbut let the expedience guide us!â It seems a miracle, so dull a Soul Should e'er espouse the causeâbut flattery well And most judiciously administeredâ And dreams of golden opportunitiesâ Of realizing yet more heaps of treasure, Through a whole world's fond gratitude to him, (I need not say how futile and how wild!) Have won him over, and his wealthâto us! Poor fly!â'tis meshedâ(aside,) and half devoured alreadyâ Thyself, sweet Signior!â Enter Millaflores. What!âthou'rt here! most punctual!â Now, noble Marquess, honour with thy homage This glorious Convert we have lately made!â (Aside.) All prospers!âFiorilina's thine!âthe Duke Will pour profusion of all honours on thee, For thou shalt be the one that, to his ear, Shall this pretended Plot ere long unfoldâ This trap to catch the incipient traitor, laid By his true loyallest servitors and subjects!â His gratitude to thee shall know no bounds!â Milla. (Aside.) 'Tis well! I feel that all will crown my efforts! (Aloud.)Before we enter on discussions graveâ Lord Count Algarvesâ(Al. starts) such your title nowâ And though sworn foes to titles we are all, I would not lop off the honours yet, that bud From the great Tree of Honour in the State, And fall upon the favourites of the Hour, Till that the tree itself shall be hewn down! (Aside to Lam.)Is that well mouthed?âis that the style patriotic?â The twang heroical?â(Aloud.) Ere yet we speed With our adventurous tongues our great emprizeâ I fain would ask your sage opinion, Sir, Of Lady Fiorilina's love for meâ Think'st thou 'tis lasting, or but fleeting Passion?â I think she fears my Heart is too, too changeful!â Al. (smiling.) I think she will resist her love and theeâ Inspired with that deep dread, and e'en refuse thee!â Milla. Refuse! impossible!âI have now a scheme To make her give me one kind rendezvous, In my proud Funeral Vault!âShe must be won Thereâthere she must be won!âmade all my own!â She never could resist the aspect fair Of those sweet coffins, nor unsoftened look On their moth-eaten arms and coverings tarnished! Her purposed Heartâmust to those hatchments melt!â She could not shut her eyes 'gainst those Inscriptionsâ The nails,âthe plates,âthe handles!â Lam. Nay! awhile Forget the enchanting Fiorilina!â Al. (Aside.) Best, Methinks, to put off for awhile discourse Upon our plansâtill we are rid of him!â Not pressing sayest thou, now is the exigenceâ At least, not as regards some hours the later!â Lam. No!âat the hour of sunset I will comeâ Bring with me all the documents and papersâ The names and signaturesâand thou shalt add Thine own to those already gleaming thereâ Upon that noblest-blazon roll of Fame!â The Fame to be!âand to be everlasting!â True!âtrue!â'tis vain to seek to dwell on business With this poor addle-brained, vain Marquess hereâ Soâloved associate!âI will quit thee nowâ Will come alone this evening, or bring one More suited to the emergency and question, For soon must all be ready for the rising!â Wilt please thee, Marquess, bear me company?â Farewell, Algarves!âComrade!âBrother!âFriend!â Farewell!â Al. Heaven speed ye!â Milla. Farewell thee wellâLord Count!â [Exit Milla. and Lam. Al. Lord Count!âa pang shoots through my breast and brain!â It did beforeâand doubly doth it nowâ Without the insinuating Lambertazzi To step in with his smoothness, and beguile it!â But now that thus alone againâalone?â Methinks to be alone becomes a terror!â What am I?âRebel!âIngrate!âTraitor!âMonster!â To my munificent and trusting Master!â I feel as though the scales dropped off mine eyesâ The dream from off my Heart!âI have been mad!â And I must be so still!âabhorrent thoughtâ No way can I escape!âmy Guardian Angel Hath surely fled away and left meâfallen!â No way remains!âfor either way I now Must be a Traitor and a perjured Villainâ I must betray my Party or my Prince!â I stand in marvelling horror at myself!â This fever-dream is gone!âI seeâI ownâ With shuddering wonderâmy enormous guiltâ And ev'n yet more enormous folly!âHeavens!â I feel weakâweak as some most feeble moth That speeds unto the bright Destruction stillâ Though touchedâscorchedâwarnedâand Iâyes!âsome hours back, Ere yet that devilish scroll disturbed my Reason, I was the Lion in such loneliness!â Most unapproached and unapproachable By fear or dull dismay!â'tis thusâ'tis thisâ The honest Heart in its high consciousness, Stands armed with all the thunderbolts of Heaven, And the dishonest Heart instinctively, (That which hath suddenly and deeply fallen,) Turns them with all their terrors 'gainst itself!â The Instinct of Vice avengeth Virtue thus!â Enter Rodriquez. Rod. My gracious Master, at your doors awaits A stranger-Lady, veiled from head to foot, Who earnestly requests a moment's parley!â Your honoured answer?â Al. How! Rodriquez! sure This must be my dear Mother!âI suspected The deep-veiled stranger of last night was her!â Rod. The stature and the shape in nought resemble Your Lady Mother's. Al. (Aside.) Ah!âmy Heart!âthou throbb'st, As though to celebrate the adored One's coming!â Can it be thee, Costanza?â(Aloud.) Well! admit her!â [Exit Rodriquez. My thronging thoughts assembling round my Heart, Seem strangely conscious of the precious Presenceâ Yet not of Happiness! no! shame,âpain,âanguish,â Dark Heralds for her beautiful approaching!â Enter Costanza; she unveils. Cos. Thou canst not think that I this step would take Boldlyâunblushingly!â Al. I cannot think it!â Thus seeing thee as beautiful as Heavenâ Rosier than summer-sunset's clouds of bloom, When all the summer and when all the sun Seem gathered into one imperial glow, That scarce will spare its rays from its own height, Concentred in one crowning-flush of glory, That makes all else seem darkness!âwhile thereâthere,â Light showeth like the living Angel's aspect, Blushing ethereal Beauty!âbut it fades!â That glow celestialâthat beatific bloomâ And in its stead, 'tis the Evening's Star's sweet pallor!â Costanza! all my Soul turns pale before thee!â Cos. And is there cause!â Al. Aye!âdeadly, desperate cause!â Look not upon meâI deserve it not!â 'Twere bliss!âoh! hate me!â Cos. Couldst hate ME, Alphonzo?â Al. Oh!âI am vileâthe vilest of the low!â Cos. Then Love shall more ennoble thee!â Al. Disgraced!â Cos. More dear in desolation, ifâ Al. Dishonoured!â Cos. Then I can dieâand hear not of it!â Al. Hold!â I am unworthy of theeâI resign thee!â Yea!â Cos. Thenâdestroy me! cruel! first, destroy me!â Al. And dost thou love so well?âthere yet is Hope!â There shall be hope!âan Angel's visit thus Once more may bode deep good, for the condemned one! Cos. Let me unfold the purport of my comingâ Lest some dark hindrance haply intervene!â The Countâhe smiles on theeâsay! is't not so?â Al. He dothâ'tis true!â Cos. Mistrust those treacherous smiles!â With agony I speak such words 'gainst himâ They wound me in the uttering!âbut I fearâ For thee I fearâand all my Heart is thineâ Thy feet are on the precipiceâthe fall Is near at handâand all of thee will be Ere longâDestruction!âif I do not speak them!â Oh! Love! Algarves! yet beware!âbeware!â Al. I pray theeâ Cos. Hear me further!âI suspect There is some schemeâsome poisonous perilous scheme Now building, to devote thy Soul to ruinâ Abuse thy life to anguish and remorseâ Betray thy hands to chainsâor heart to breaking!â Al. There is a Tempest gathering round me nowâ A tempest of temptations that upteareth My Soul's foundations in its tossing path, But I will not be shattered, will not sinkâ Will not be made the howling Horror's Preyâ Worseâthe vain glittering Glory's Victimâno!â I will stand firm!â Cos. On Rocks of Righteousnessâ So Heaven's sweet Saints best speed ye!âbut this morn My faithful MaidenâMonna Lauraâheard By accident, a strange and dark discourse, In which Count Lambertazzi bore a part. 'Twas question much of you and of the Duke, And as I fearâto shake your true allegianceâ To make your Heart black with ingratitudeâ Your Mind with treasonous stratagems, and mysteriesâ Foul, viperous, villainous, and stained seditions!â And much, my Lord Algarves!âmuch I fearâ My name will beâhath beenâpronouncedâdire Thought! To lure thee on to loss of Faith and Honour!â If soâbut no! Algarves!âwell thou know'st meâ I need not stand here with my cheeks on fire, To tell thee, nor my hand, nor heartâshould e'er Be given to one foul, foul with hideous treacheriesâ A lost toad-spotted Traitor!â Al. Now hear me!â At the earliest opportunity that offers, (Concealing with most rigid scrupulous care Thine Uncle's name and share in this black scheme,) I will lay bare my darkened Soul to himâ Whom I could outrage with the irreverend daring Of libellous and most rebellious thinkingsâ Yet I must own to themâI will not wrong them, My comrades in this pestilent cabalâ (As I have wronged myself and himâmy Sovereignâ) I must own all to themâI will not blind themâ Will not betray them, nor deceive them, no! I will reveal to them my purposed deedâ Then leave them to their Consciences and Counsels!â Hoping, though not suspecting them, the Prince May be forewarned 'gainst all vile festering discords. Costanza!âleave me, till my Soul is cleared Of this dark burthen of profound remorseâ Thy Presence is a torture now to meâ Oh! leave me!â Cos. (timidly.) I must hold unto the hope, That this stern exigency, nought admitting Of other agency or of delay, Acquits me in your sight of boldness foreignâ I may sayâforeign to my acts and feelings!â And saves me from your harsher judgments thusâ Al. Oh! save me!âbut from worshipping thy sweetnessâ And making thee an idol at this momentâ While loving with a love too great and awful!â Strong grows the wild religion of the Heart!â Thine air angelical, and acts and accentsâ And the atmosphere of Virtue gathered round theeâ Maidenly Heavenly-mindedness and Honour, And Purity in all Perfection's height Oppress me, bend me to the earth, and ask My kneeâuplifted handsâand heart's obeisance!â Cos. Nay!âbut think gently, very gently of me!â And oh! forget thou not thy promise!â Al. No!â So help me Heavenâand Heaven's!âfor such thou art, Sweet Soul! that came a Messenger of Light To pluck me from the Pitfall of my ruin!â To-morrow, I will all unfold!âto-morrow!â And from this down-weighed mind discharge the load Of sick remorse,âand consciences of evil!â Good Angels keep thee!âand thy Heart keep me!â So must I yet be right!â Cos. Farewell! Algarves!â [Exit Costanza. Al. Thou noble Being!âpure and great and bright Stands thy firm Spiritâall a rock of Truth!â Oh! we should careful be on whom our choice May fall with such strong fervency of feeling!â Else 'stead of harmony and bliss and peace, The Angel-eyed Love might scatter ravening Tempests!â But Oh! thou art worthyâworthy thou art found To be shrined intimately thusâand near The eternal Image in another's Soul!â [Exit Algarves.

The Duke is much disturbedâill fate attends himâ This sport goes illâthis princely Falconry!â 'Tis thousand pities!âfor my part, methinks, This vast assembled crowd does desperate mischief!â The birds are scared by shouts, and cries, and tramplingsâ 'Tis all one hubbub now!â First Noble. When on the ground, New lit upon their preyâthe rush and stir Of hurrying hundreds startle them and scareâ Nor can the Falconers lure them back again. Second Noble. Our fairest Florentines, with flaunting colours, And flying draperies, and far-fluttering plumes, And waving kerchiefs, (to say nought besides, Of tongues that far out-ring the Hawk's gay bells,) May well affright the poor long hooded birdsâ The Falcon Queen, His Highness' favourite Hawk, Is lostâthey long have followed her in vain!â Dio. The Falcon Queen! a mighty bird and brave!â Oh! I have seen her, like a rushing storm, Make the Heavens darken with her wingsâshe seemed (So the eye fastened to her shadowing suddennessâ Still seeing her where she had beenâand was notâ Until she multiplied in endless movementâ) A winged Ubiquityâan Omnipresenceâ Here, there, and everywhere!â Enter the Grand Duke, attended by Courtiers, Falconers, &amp;c.;âa Hawk on his wrist. Grand Duke. Ho! Falconers good!â Ho!âgallant Hearts!âye followed well the sport!â We made a glorious Storm of it!âby Heavens!â The hoofs of Thunder on the echoing groundâ The wings of Lightning in the quivering skies!â But my fair Bird, the Falcon-Queen, is lost!â I fear me she is lostâthe Bird was scared By all the bravery of our Florentines!â Their scarlets and their purples and their yellows!â But come! Signors of Florence!âto the field!â Another castâmy Bird of Beauty hereâ âLa Belle Dame sans Merciââmust straight be tried, With her companion good, âthe Flying Dragon!ââ Hence! fair Signors!â First Noble. Your Highness does us honour!â [Exeunt Grand Duke, Nobles, Falconers. Dio. A moment, stay!âdidst mark the Princess? Cres. Yes!â Indeed I didâwith cruel-curious keenness!â Dio. Be sure she loves the Guicciardiniâelse I never read a Maid's ingenuous heart Blazoned upon her cheek,âdeep bathed in blushesâ For so the cheek of sweet Beatrice wasâ That ever fairly in all beauty wore Its rich blood-royal bloom, and mock'd the rose!â Cres. Fair is the youthful Princess!âdowered with grace!â But Oh! not fair as is the unmatched Costanza!â All others are as Ãthiops by her sideâ Yet she could spare them charms to make them angels!â Costanza is consummate Beauty!â Dio. Soh!â Good troth!âthy Praise is warm; I ever thought Thy heart was well inclined unto the maidâ But now suspect thou sighest for her bright charmsâ With all a Lover's vehemence!â Cres. 'Twere in vain!â Thou know'st she is contracted to Lorenzo!â Indeed 'twere vain!âbesidesâ Dio. Hark!âhark!âa shout!â A wild long-echoing shout!âand hark! again!â Was't not Algarves' name I caught?â Cres. It was!â Ring cries of âLive the Princess!âââLive Algarves!ââ What means it?âcome!âwe must not linger here!â Dio. Nay! speed here some informantsâpause awhile!â Enter Giovanni and Francesco. Cres. What means this outery?â Fran. Excellent Signors!â A dire mischance was threatened and averted!â The Princess Beatrice's mettled horse Had well nigh dashed himself, with his fair burthen, Adown the bank by yonder chrystal stream!â A pigeon lately loosedâfor refuge fled Ev'n to the fair Princess's glittering draperies, That swept low down beneath her courser's housingsâ (And finally sought safety on her lap,)â The hawk swift followed itâthe affrighted steed, With furious snorting, and with startled bound, Received the unwelcome guestsâhis desperate hoof Brained the doomed hawk, the while, the fluttering pigeon Flew 'twixt his fore-legsâadding dread to dread!â Though at that moment Count Giordano held The silken reins, the infuriate creature burst With one wild bound awayâtill intercepted By Count Algarvesâa most gallant horseman, Who from the distance viewed the fearful danger, And sped him to the rescueâwhich accomplishedâ 'Twas found, that in its brave atchievement thusâ Himself was hurtâbut slightly, in the armâ Strained by the shock!â Cres. Come! come! my Friend, at once!â We should not loiter, but should promptly tender Our joint congratulations cordiallyâ Both to the Princess and the Sovereign Duke!â [Exeunt Cres. and Dio. Gio. Oh! that I had saved our fair Princess's lifeâ I doubt not I had then been knighted straightâ Thwack!âthwack!âand made Hereditary highâ Great chief Lord Constable and Chamberlain!â Ill luck!âand cross befallings, by the rood!â The foul fiend fly off with that meddling Spaniard!â Say Iâand all his olive-coloured brethren!â What right hath he to come and thrust himself Between us and the beckoning Honours thus?â The gold spurs snatching, off our longing heelsâ The bread from out our gaping mouthsâ'fore Heaven!â 'Tis past my patience to endure the thoughtâ We have lost gold spursâsquiresâlacqueysâplaceâpromotion!â Francesco! thou'rt too tame!â Fran.

Milla. Giovanni and Francesco!âto your posts!â I stand amazed to find you loitering here!â His Highness must not miss you in his train!â 'Tis such remissness in the Court's retainersâ That most endangers Kingdoms and their Rulersâ [Exeunt Gio. and Fran. Well! prithee!âSignor Count Algarves!ânow Detail to me how 'twas you saved the Princessâ A most sublime atchievement!â Al. It was thusâ The pigeon flew into Her Highness' lapâ Milla. Excuse me, Sirâyou speak most unadvisedlyâ Princesses have no lapsâit is indeed Outrageous insult!ânay! I would observe, Abominationâso to speak of them!â Al. Faith! well, Sir! on the august Princess's knees!â Milla. Her knees!â Al. Come, come! the deuce is in't!âd'ye mean They are like jointless dolls?âwhy! what the plague! Perhaps you think that Princes have no limbs, Sage Millaflores! you are in error there!â 'Tis only Courtiers have no understandings!â No knees!â(nay, suffer me to speak, I pray!)â How could she fall upon them, which she didâ What time I checked her mad, infuriate horse, And snatched her from the saddle, while I felt Her poor Heart beatâ Milla. Your language, Sir! excuse me!â Becomes yet more injurious!âwould you dare Suppose Princesses can have hearts that beat?â Al. 'Fore Heaven, Sir, if they have not, you will make Myself remember I have hands that can!â If thus these strange insulting interruptions With most unseasoned rigour you pursue! I will not bear it longer!â Milla. Nay, indeed I must decline your proffered favour, Sir,â Your hands are too unworthy of the office, Seeing they're not of honourable clayâ (And also, that your arms are quite unknown)â And if you venture to presume to act it, I must assure you I shall hold myself Bound to consider myselfâstill unbeaten;â I grieve to contradict thus any man, But cannot answer to my conscience, so To let myself look on myself as thrashed By hands so bare of adventitious aptness!â Hands! Sir!âif you have at your fingers' ends Your pedigree, I may consent to thisâ (You must observe, that liberal though I am, And panting to establish equal rights, While yet the present system still subsists, I feel it is my dutyâclearly markedâ To stand by mine own order thus and place)â Now I do look on handsâ Al. Leave fooling, Sir!â Milla. (with dignity.) It ne'er was in my power to play the foolâ By Nature o'er-endued with deepest wisdomâ But I must make you fully understandâ Your new-made title, Count! cannot be old!â Wait some few generationsâthen indeedâ In short, Sir! I conceive your Great-great-Grandson Might be allowed to challenge and chastise me!â Hands?âhands?âhave yours the knightly gauntlet worn? (Aside.)I guess the Peasant's hedge gloves would suit better!â (Aloud.)I doubt if in such lofty exercise I can indulge themâmanual labour may Have oft dishonoured themâand then, perchance, In contact with base thingsâ Al. Death! Sir!âbeware!â Lest manual labour they should now attempt, And come in contact with base things indeed!â (Aside.)But let me not take heed of this vain fool, Or aught that he can say,â'tis out of reason!)â Milla. Hands! Count!âyourself may be perhaps the offspring Of some left-handed marriage!âI must knowâ Besidesâgood Sir!âif that same name you bear Be handed down at least two generationsâ Ev'n though not nobleâgentle in degree!â If not, worthy, worthy Count, you might pretend To beat me! but no image of a bruise Should blacken o'er my high Imaginationâ Hands! Sir!âit is not that I mean exactlyâ Hands are not Hands!âbut then the vulgar views Taken of course by Physiologistsâ By dull anatomists and grave Logicians, And studious naturalists, and rude mechanics, Are different from a man's of noble bloodâ A man of science in high breeding's art!â True!âthe Arms they terminateâand furnish thus The extremitiesâ Al. Hold! Sir! the Duke is coming!â Enter the Grand Duke, Attendants, &amp;c. Duke. Algarves!âlong we vainly sought for theeâ Thou hast retreated from our thanks and praises!â Now, Gentlemen! we do not need your serviceâ But fain would hold discourse awhile alone, With our good friend the Count Algarves!â [Milla. &amp;c. go out. Now!â Hear! hear me, best and bravest!âI do feel Thou hast been twice made the Saviour of my Life!â Thus having saved my Sister's as mine ownâ My Sister's!âev'n a dearer part of mine!â Mine obligations unto thee oppress me!â Nought I can give can equal thy deserts!â Al. (Aside.) Oh! torture to the height of madness!âthis!â (Aloud.)Your Highness far o'errates my petty deeds!â Duke. No! no!âI do not!âand I cannotâno!â Algarves!âas a proof of mine esteemâ My friendship, love, and boundless gratitudeâ How now! thou tremblest!â Al. I am crushedâo'erwhelmed!â Duke. Aye! by a very avalanche, methinks,â It leaves your brow, in sooth, as white and tintless!â But listen how I purpose to promote you!â I offer you my much-loved Sister's handâ And such advancement as may best befit The Consort of a Princess of our Houseâ The additions and the accompanyings all Of such exalted state!â Al. Forbear!âforbear!â For every reason, yet forbear! my Liege!â (Aside.)Dastard as traitor!âall my courage fails me!â Oh! would I dared confess!â Duke. Forbear!âexplain!â What mean'st thou?â Al. Most dread Lord! this cannot be!â I cannot wed the Princess!â Duke. How!âis't so?â Darest thou refuse my Sister?âscorn the honour That I would do thee?â Al. Pity me, Great Duke!â I cannot give that faithful Heart which should Accompany this most unworthy hand!â Duke. Thou lov'st another?â Al. Duke! I love another!â With soul and heart and mind to her devoted!â Duke. That other is?â Al. Costanza Lambertazzi!â Duke. And hast good hope?â Al. My Liege! I have good hopeâ But I entreat your Highness to forbearâ Nor on that point to probe with further question!â Liege Lord!âwilt graciously permit me now To speak of thy most honoured Sister? Duke. Speak! Al. I do know one who loves the beauteous Princess, Ev'n as she should be lovedâwith fullest Soulâ And uttermost devotion and Heart's homageâ One too, whom I have reasons strong and cogent, To think the gracious Princess loves as deeplyâ My Friend, the Guicciardini!â Duke. What!âis't thus?â I nought of this suspectedânought observed!â If 'tis indeed as you imagineâgood!â The Guicciardini shall espouse my Sister!â His title to so high an honour, know, Is being thy best friend!âfor thy dear sake, My brave Deliverer, do I yield consent To these espousals, and at thy sole instance!â It shall be so!âbut for thyself, beseech thee Choose now some fitting mark of my regardâ My perfect friendship!â Al. For myself!âmyself!â The rackâthe wheelâthe dungeonâor the grave!â At once the tortureâor at once the tomb!â All! everything but this!âthy maddening kindness!â Duke. What transport thus possesses thee?â Al. But hear!â And sentence, sentence me!â(throws himself on his knees:) I am a traitor!â The rankest, basest, foulest that e'er trailed His slime empoisoned o'er the exuberant growths Of generous bountyâunsuspecting goodness!â I have been leaguedâthank Heaven that I can say Have beenâthat 'twas a moment's passing phrenzyâ With plotters 'gainst thy Princely state!â Duke. And life?â The Life, Algarves! that yourself preserved?â Al No! infamous beyond all words to speak!â I yet stopped short of such a fiendish horror!â Thou askedst me to choose some mark of graceâ Of favourâand I would do soâyet ask No graceâno favourâsave most rigorous justice!â No bountyâbut eternal Banishment!â Nay, better farâfar betterâinstant death!â Mercy!âand curse me!âPity!âthen and crush me!â Forbearance!âand but stretch me on the rack!â For thisâthy murdering magnanimity Drives the sharp death-blow to my living Soul!â Low in the dust let me pour out that Soulâ And deprecateâah no!âimplore and pray Thy worst severity!â Duke. Up!âup!âmy Friend! High as my Heart!âup! up! I say!âand then Thou'rt higher than the Sun!âfor I do feel ForgivenessâMercyâbest ennoble Man, Beingâbest attributes of Him who made Him!â Al. This wounds to more profound extremity!â Oh! measurelessly more than hate and harshness!â These towering magnanimities of Soul Rebuke me with a Voice that shames the Trumpet!â But I will not be pardoned!âI will not!â I do refuse thy merciesâand deny them!â Reject thy great forgiveness and forbearance!â Thou hast no right to throw aside from thee All the awful attributes that wait on Monarchs!â I ask for justiceâand thou giv'st me mercyâ I claim thy justice and refuse that mercy!â Duke. Art mad, Algarves?âif thou lov'st me, cease!â Nor think a moment of some strange delirium Hath cancelled obligationsâ Al. What!âthat word!â That word again!âOh! maddening mockery! hush!â Know'st not that I am bound to thee as muchâ Nay! more! a thousandâthousand times yet moreâ By being made e'en the Instrument of Heaven For saving thus thy life, than thou to meâ Than unto meâweak tool of Powerâart thou, Who wert reserved by Providence for safety?â Thus Parents better love their children ever, (Whom they impose all obligations on)â Than children do their Parents!âStill, doth man All tremblingly in mystic joy, receive Heaven's holy sanction thus to act its part!â And the Deliverer owes to the Delivered A most large debt!âStill since the eventful day I felt strong tiesâthe strongest of all tiesâ United thee and me; since mine was made The blessedness to lengthen out thy life!â I had that happy consciousness for ever, And thanked thee, who the high occasion gave To me to snatch a fellow-creature thusâ Back from the grave that yawned before his feet!â I was the grateful One and ought to be soâ But how?âOh! how have I shown gratitude For thisâfor allâfor all thou hast since done for me?â Duke. I charge thee nowâno more!âI will not hear thee!â Thou shalt not trench on my Prerogativeâ My loftiest!âholiest!âI have pardoned thee!â And I will pardon theeâand for thy sakeâ Thy screened accomplicesâunnamedâunknown!â Yet tell me, who dared tempt thee,âfor I feel Thou hast been temptedâtell me honestlyâ At once now tell me!â Al. Whatsoe'er their guilt, Mineâovershadowing and outstripping theirs,â As night's pitch darkness doth a cloud's faint gloom, Doth render me indeed the most unfit For task of such denouncement!âUrge me not!â Oh!âurge me not! Great Duke!âtakeâtake my life. With tortures such as might, for thousand deaths, With all their argument of agony, Stand representativesâbut spare me there!â Duke. I ask no moreâbut must not hide from thee That I have shrewd suspicions of the truth. Princes have many ears that do them service, Well as long arms!âand though no Dionysius, One I possess, that makes me Lord of secrets I often wish were buried in oblivionâ 'Tis e'en my faithful Minister's!âlet passâ We need not enter now on long discussions!â Be sure I know thy tempterâmore, I say not,â But though for thy sake I do pardon him, 'Tis not with such full Soul, but that I yet Shall visit his dark crime with retributionâ Not such as well it merits, but light chasteningâ Thou know'st not all the darkness of his deedsâ Hush!âHush! we are interruptedânot a wordâ Prepare thy friendâthe noble Guicciardiniâ For all the good and greatness we design him!â Enter Francesco. Fran. So please your Highnessâby your fair command, Another flight hath just been tried and finished; âLa Belle Dame sans merciâ surpassed herselfâ Her stoops were thunderstrokes, herself, she conquered,â Nor needed from her partner aught of aid, And brought the vanquished quarry to the groundâ Her first swoop sent it forty fathoms down, All shriekingâfluttering in the air!â Enter Giovanni. Gio. My Liege!â The flying Dragon hath received a hurt;â Dividing from her partner, each selecting A noble Heron, (it fortuned, two flew near,) She battled bravely 'gainst her screaming foeâ But plunging down impetuously and fiercely, Spiked on the Heron's sharp spearlike beak remainedâ That deadly weapon she can wield so well,â Upraised to do the mortal hurt.â Duke. Ill chance!â Our sport to-day hath cost us dearâI wotâ The Falcon Queenâa noble Bird of warâ Of most admired and finished scienceâlost!â And now the Flying Dragon hurt to death!â Fly âLa belle Dameâ once more, if serves the windâ Methought but now 'twas changingâthen feed up!â Apprize the Princess I would speak with herâ And instant, one of youâgo advertise Unto that same effect, Signor di Montri, Our Lord Grand Falconerâhence!âand spare not speed!â [Exeunt Fran. and Gio. What still amort!âlook up! my Friend, look up!â Thou thought'st thyself infallible it seemsâ Now this hath happened well, to show thee truth. We all are weak if we relax our watchingâ For ne'er beleaguered city yet required Such wakeful sentinels, such careful warders, As man's 'seiged heart beset with all temptations!â Come with me, we must seek thy gallant Friend!â Come with me, for I will not let thee go, Until I see a voucher in thine eye That thou wilt keep the Peaceâtowards thyself!â Al. Good Saints guard ever all your princely thoughts!â [Exeunt. Scene II. âCount Lambertazzi's House. Count Lambertazzi alone. Lam. A dark foreboding strangely troubles me!â Algarves saved the young Princess's lifeâ The Duke would doubtless shower upon him all The o'erflowings of his deepening gratitudeâ And he would in the impulse of the moment Reveal at onceâthe secret he is charged with!â If soâwhy! I am lost!â'twere utter ruin!â And worse!âmy loss should be his gainâhis gain!â I scarce could make the Prince believe the plot Was but a suppositious and unreal one!â Yetâha! I have it!âyes! I still am safe!â Enter Nicolo. Nico. The Count Algarvesâif your leisure servesâ Claims speech with you and instantâ Lam. Let him enter!â [Exit Nicolo. Now will I probe him to the core with looksâ Anatomize his mind with nice precisionâ Search to the hidden corners of his heartâ And rake up all his vile pernicious thoughts!â Enter Algarves. Al. Count Lambertazzi!âI have sped to thee, To give thee notice of a deed I have done, Without circumlocution or concealment!â As far as I had entered and engaged In thy conspiracyâand dark cabalâ I have revealed the whole unto the Dukeâ Allâ Lam. Death! you did!â Al. I did!â Lam. And doubtlessâallâ And more than all that Iâand othersâ Al. Hold!â I swear to you no name hath passed these lips, And no confession save mine own to himâ He graciously released me from the task (A task not torture to the last extreme Had forced me to fulfil,) of following up My free confession by particularsâ Detailsâand full unfoldings of the Plot!â Be most assured of thisâthrough me at least The gracious Prince knows nothing of your own, Or Millaflores' implication in itâ Yet it must follow doubtlessly that he Will be more strictly on his guard, and keep A general scrutiny and certain watch. Lam. (coldly.) Your conduct, Sir! to me seems most mysteriousâ You entered in our glorious enterprise With Heart and Soulâmethought a world had failed To shake your 'stablished purpose and designâ A straw hath done it!â Al. It were vain indeedâ Most useless to discuss this subject nowâ In me the madness of a moment rose To cast the promise of a life asideâ And almost in that moment gave my Soul To the everlasting uttermost perdition!â My crime, premeditation lacked at least, And prompt repentance charmed some evil from it!â Precipitous preparation made my thoughts To range themselves with stratagems and treasons!â And as precipitately these prepared (And well it was such deep contrition came,) To stand once more in the open ranks of Virtue, Though drooping with the weight of conscious wrong!â Ev'n drooping to the dust!â Lam. Enough! Sir!âgo!â And if you can,ârenounce these glorious visions That rushed upon your mind in tides of triumph!â Your thoughts had ranged themselves right royally Upon the side of suffering Human Natureâ The rights of manâthe freedom of the world!â They shrink now back to join the fatal Phalanxâ The cold confederacy of formal judgmentsâ For ever leagued and linked in hateful pact Against the Peopleâ'gainst the Mass of Man!â Traitor thou calledst thyselfâI tell thee no!â The Traitors are the Tyrants that abuse The hands of all born Freedom unto chains!â But go! I plead notâwhere in vain are pleading The rights and hopes of the endless generations!â The high humanitiesâand Heav'n-born instincts That point one path, and steer but by one star!â I plead not where unheard are pleading still The tongues of thrice ten thousand Angels!âGo!â Forsake the hope to raise and bless mankind,â But in their degradation find thy doom!â Thou hast a Soul that pines with proudest thirstsâ It still must pineâwhile Slavery walks the world!â The very Tyrants that oppress their fellows, Oppress themselvesâand must themselves debar From good and greatnessâsole to be atchieved Through joint free efforts of a world untrammelled!â They little know how much they lack and loseâ How utterly impoverished, weakened, loweredâ The world they sway, is, by their rule pernicious!â They little knowâ Al. I pray thee, noble Count, Permit my absence. Not your zealous bursts Of wild enthusiasm can move me now, Save to regret I e'er was blinded by them!â But I am sobered now, and all unshakenâ The infatuation and the illusioned moodâ Of strange excitement, have subsided all!â Howe'er to Fancy seem the unreal splendours Thou conjurest up, with light and truth endued, Sound Reason looks through each fantastic fabric, And views the o'er-weening Vanity shrined in itâ Sees too the impossibilitiesâ Lam. Away!â That word insults the Almightiness of Virtue! I may not listen to thy cold discourse!â Go! help to forge the chains that ever best Fit those that frame them for another's neck!â And take thy long farewell of all that shone In bright perspective to thine eyes beforeâ Fame, Freedom, Honour, Truth, and Right and Loveâ The Happiness of myriads with thine own!â Thy Country's and Costanza'sâtheirsâyes! theirs!â And more, the good of the Universal Countryâ The great Creator's Country!âwide Creation!â Al. (aside.) He troubles me!âbe firm! my Soul!âbe firm!â (Aloud.)I goâyet I would pray thee to dismiss These visionary schemes of fancied goodâ A good impossible I fear on earthâ And do thy best as far as in thee lies To aid the cause of Man by other means Than treacherousâ Lam. Hence!âbut spare me thine advice!â Not oft at my age men endure a tutor!â My grave Preceptors are within! the thoughts And inmost counsels of near threescore years!â Irreverend boy! away!â Al. Forgive me! yes!â I have much erred, forgive me!â Lam. Aye!âand hence!â [Exit Algarves. Forgive thee! when the arch Rebel is forgivenâ And on his throne on highâin Heavenâonce moreâ Thenânot till then will I forgive thee!âYes!â 'Tis failureâfailure all! on every side!â Far more than ever do I hate thee now!â I will make meshes of my heart's own fibres, Alive, and quivering with convulsion's anguish, But I will trap thy steps unwary, yet!â So! Nicolo! within there!â Nicolo enters. Nico. Gracious Count!â Command you aught?â Lam. Yes! hie you instantly To Ugo Marcoâbid him hither send, At earliest speed, one Diego Riva, known Full well to him; and take this token with ye, [Gives a signet ring. Charge them to loiter notâand straight begone!â [Exit Nicolo. Lam. Look to thyselfâproud Penitent!âtwice Traitor!â Thou yet shalt expiate every sin 'gainst meâ The greatestâbeingâwhat I fear thou artâ The heir to Andrea!âWhat! must I then see My sweet Costanzaâ(all her mother smileth In her fair aspect, touched with tenderest softness! The while no trace of her appears in thee!)â My sweet Costanza thrown asideâimpoverishedâ By such an arrant Wanderer,âutter Venturer?â And then I shudd'ring think how thou hast inspiredâ Thouâthou her Brotherâfeelings whichâ Enter Lorenzo. Loren. Forgiveâ I pray thee, good my Lord!âthe haste of griefâ Which thus hath forced me unannounced, at once Into thy presenceâI can hide no longer From mine own self nor thee the bitter truthâ Costanza loves me notâand loves Algarves!â Lam. Between Costanza and Algarves yawns A gulph, so terrible, that with one word Could I now change that love you dream you see In her young Soul, to horror without end!â A bar insuperable is raised between themâ She never can be hisâlet this suffice!â Loren. Say, what can be that gulph?â Lam. Inquire no more!â Enough that it is soâtime may reveal itâ For me I cannotâdare notâmust notâno!â It ne'er shall pass these lipsâwhoe'er reveals it, I should notâand I shall notâthis believe!â Whate'er may seem Costanza's backwardness To join her hand with yoursâit yet must be!â And will be for her happiness in the end!â If she will not espouse theeâshe is doomed!â The veil must be her portion!âWho draws near?â Is't Millaflores?â Loren. (looking off.) Aye!âand Count!âfarewell!â My Heart is soreâI cannot brook his follies!â Enter Millaflores. Milla. Nay! good Lorenzo!âwhat! art going?â Loren. Yes!â Much business trenches on my time to-day!â [Exit Lorenzo. Lam. (aside.) This empty fool, even better saw than I The ill-starr'd catastrophe of my design, And prophesied the end with wond'rous shrewdnessâ Strangeâstrange!â(Aloud.) Did my despatch come safe to hand?â Milla. It didâwas I not right?âOh! I was sure, Once in the vortex of the Princely Presenceâ The faintly purposed mind of that rash boy Would plunge amid the eddies all bewildered, And give its secrets up with headlong hurry!â But it is well he nothing said of us!â So are we safe, I trustâthe Prince conceives The error all his own, nor further questions!â Enough of him!âI seek your presence, friendâ To ask your counsel on momentous matters!â Lam. (aside.) Now must I bear with what good grace I mayâ The tedious torture of his tongue's dull clatterâ For I am in his power!âOh! fallen! fallen! fallen!â Milla. Advise you me to make proposals straight To Lady Fiorilina Diodati?â Her princely familyâher lofty rankâ Incline me much to such a step!â Lam. Thou think'st That she would marry thee?â Milla. Good troth! I do!â Who could resist me? tell me that!âNow listenâ I have possessions that might win the Heartsâ No!âhands of Queens and ermined Empresses!â Allow me first to name a catalogueâ Lam. Be speedy then, I pray!âcommence!â Milla. Attend!â For the delights of sweet Villegiatura I have a house some few fair leagues from Florenceâ Hung with worm-eaten tapestries oldâso oldâ You dare not breathe lest they should drop to piecesâ And forty volumes on fine vellum writâ Forty huge volumes quite illegibleâ (These she might study o'er and o'er for ever, I vow she'll never make a word on't out)â Of course, the subjects cannot well be known, But 'tis supposed a compilation fair Of various records of the Millafloresâ Forty huge volumes covered think with dust, Regarding my illustrious family!â Fine portraits too,âso very ancient theseâ They're much obliteratedâsome erasedâ You could not swear now if they represented An owl or manâa monkey or a fishâ So undiscoverably confused and darkenedâ Besides,âthese are fair stores of perquisites My courtier ancestors had well amassedâ A huge stone chairânone e'er can sit in itâ A drinking cupâthe bottom outâ(besides So narrow nothing but a crane I swear Could ever drink from it, and that but ill)â Seven pair of shoes most furiously turned upâ No one could wear themâin these days at least!â A Roman toga, which an ancestor Of mine,âa senator!âonce wore, when he Was torn to shreds by fierce wild Beasts, at the order Of some great Emperor whom he had offendedâ I have one rag of't worth a revenueâ A real Lachrymatoryâprecious reliqueâ Thou'dst laugh for joy o'er that lugubrious treasureâ (Enough to make her happy that for ever!) Then to crown allâAh! such a vault!âa vaultâ That makes one long to dieâto lie in it!â Lam. Good sooth! a happy prospect 'tis indeed, In Life or Death!â Milla. Thou sayst the truth, my friend!â Amongst the portraits that I told thee of, Is one not wholly vanished from the canvasâ I was at first provokedâit looks too modernâ But then, thank Heaven!âthe frame is fallen in fragments!â My Great-great-Grandmother, a noble Lady, There frowns in all the splendour of her stateâ This portrait represents her going forth To join her lordly Husband in the chaseâ Her face as solemn as a funeral!â Lam. Strange!â When thus about to take her place and part In such gay sport of ever-jocund cheer!â Milla. Know, Sir, aware of their own dignitiesâ Alive to their position and importance,â The Millaflores never condescended To be amusedâit was beneath them quiteâ Vulgar hilarity they could not share!â Lam. Why did they hunt then, prithee?â Milla. Sir?âwhy?âSir!â But that it might be said they hunted surelyâ A proper aristocratic relaxation!â Lam. Oh! Lord!âwould no one tell a lie to save Their greatnesses the trouble then, with all Their loftiness?â Milla. The question now at issue, Is whether Fiorilina would look wellâ Painted and placed among my ancestors;â There is one portrait of my Great-grand-Uncleâ His costume marks him to have been a judgeâ 'Tis partly faded, yet in part preservedâ A little dog is holding in its paws (A sweet device,) his stately coronet!â If she had oneâif she but had one like it!â Lam. A little dog?â Milla. Nay!ânay! mistake me not!â A coronet like his!â Lam. I hear a step!â Good Marquess!âI must urge thine absence nowâ It is my sweet Costanza!âI must hold Discourse with her in privateâpray your pardonâ But there are subjectsâ Milla. I am gone at once!â (Exit Millaflores; and enter Costanza at the opposite side.) Lam. Approach, my child!â Cos. Oh! blessings on that word!â Lam. Deserve it! and it ever will be thine!â Once more, I urge thee, by all love and dutyâ By all things sacred, and all things endearedâ To marry with Lorenzo!â Cos. Never! no!â Lam. No!âthen a Convent shall receive ye straightâ For know, none other e'er shall claim thy hand!â Yetâyet beware!âthinkâpauseâand weigh!âbeware!â [Exit Lambertazzi. Cos. Grief crowds on grief, and all is suffering now!â Who calls thee King of Terrors?âDeath! dear Angel!â Thouâthou art the King of Terrors! Life! dark Life!â And once I could be happy!âoh! how happy!â I was the larkâI was the chainless breezeâ I was the morning!âaye! I was the Sun!â The crowned Sun was my Soul!âmy very Soul!â I was each flower that beautified the Earthâ Each Star that blazoned forth the eternal Heavens!â And nowâthe ruinous difference!âI am all That is the embodying or the sign of grief!â Thenâthen my thoughts went flying all abroadâ I lived out of myselfâall happy things Were part of me!âmy Life is now crushed in!â Oh! Majesty of Sovereign Misery!â I worship at the foot of thy dim throne!â And pour my Soul, sense, strength, out in that worship!â Enter Monna Laura. Laura. Dear Ladyâwilt thou see thy gentle Friend, The noble Fiorilina?â Cos. On the instant! [Exit Monna Laura. Let sorrow feed on other sorrow now, Till joy shall seem a thing indeed unreal!â Enter Fiorilina. My Friend, my Sisterâstill thy gentle presence Anticipates the pulses of my Heart!â They throbbed to chime with thy approaching steps!â I pined for them, and here thou art!â Fio. Thou'rt changed!â Thine eye is hollowâand thy cheek how wan!â Thou look'st all tears!âfrom worse to worse it darkeneth!â Cos. The Convent now, or this loathed contract's horror!â Fio. Thou'st chosen?â Cos. Doubt me not!â Fio. Now hear me, Sweet!â Lorenzoâstruck by thy despairing looksâ Thy shrinking from his homage and approachesâ Methinks, hath guessed the truthâand more than thatâ For having guessed that truth, I dare to hope He hath half triumphed o'er his ill-starred passion!â And looked with eye of feeling on thy Friend!â Cos. A gleam of joy in midst of all this gloom! A vale of peace midst mountain-peaks of storm!â Fio. It seemsâCostanzaâI confess my pride Could never suffer me to help thee thusâ But it doth seem to me wer't once made known To young Lorenzo!âthat thy Heart shrinks from himâ He could not for one moment longer urge His suit to thee, but would withdraw his claim!â Cos. Alas! I know not!â Fio. If I thought not so, By all the thrones that blaze in all the Heavensâ By all the hosts of all the Heaven of Heavensâ I would unteach the lesson of this love To every feeling of my woman's Soulâ Would blot his image from my Spirit's mirror!â Aye! from my height of Heart would hurl him down With sovereignty of spurning and all scorning To the descent and dust beneath my feet, Defying and denyingâleaving,âloathing!â Though I have worn thee in my very Soul, Lorenzo!âloved beyond what thought can image!â I would not soil that Soul again with theeâ I would not dim my thoughts with thee or thine!â Oh! fallen from honourâfallen from noble fameâ If this indeed could be the hateful truth!â Cos. I cannot think it, yet I fearâI fearâ My thoughts, that once all brightened into hopes, Now tremble into terrorsâof themselves!â Fio. Sweet Saints! how pale thou art!âthe very lily Were blooming near thy cheek!âcall Monna Lauraâ Her cheerful prattle evermore was wont To please thee and beguileâI'll seek for her!â [Exit Fiorilina. Cos. To please meâyes!âit needed little thenâ Now it needs muchâyet but one thing could do itâ Thy Presence, oh! Algarves!â Re-enter Fiorilina with Laura. Lau. Dearest Ladyâ Oh! art not ill? it is thy ghost be sureâ So pallid and so changed!âAh! well-a-day!â 'Tis all for nothing, this!âI know, for nothing!â Since well I know it is for nought but loveâ And love is nothingâthough for that, 'tis trueâ Myself too am entirely broken-hearted!â Fio. How, Laura!âthou, the gay, the free, the blithe!â Lau. Ev'n so!âSignora!âbroken-hearted, blightedâ Deserted by the admirer who professed To worship me, and swore his love should last While stars were visible in yon clear sky!â Fio. Then the first cloudy night his love should cease!â Lau. (dejectedly.) It ceasedâor changedâand, Lady, 'tis your maidenâ Even yours that now my false-souled Love adores!â Fio.

Thine altered mien reminds me Of that eventful time, when I was called To thy sick couchâthy deathbed, as 'twas thought!â To hear the secret then divulged to me!â Jero. And I well think, my Daughter! from that hourâ I gradually amendedâthrowing off The leprous burthen that oppressed my Soul, And seemed to rack my frame as well,âas though Immedicable its sharp sickness were, While yet that spirit-malady remained!â Thank Heaven!âthe whole extent of that black crime Was spared my shuddering conscienceâwhat was doneâ Enough distracted it, and agonized!â Inez. Thou wert the Father made of my new Life!â Oh! ne'er shall I forget the o'erwhelming joy Which rose e'en like a Sun, from Misery's midnight!â I felt created o'er again that moment!â Shame, like a poisoned garment, had clung round meâ The festering infamy had wrung my feelingsâ And maddening self-reproach and self-abhorrence, Had shut my Life in, on one hideous thought!â Oh! never Prisoner from his gyves releasedâ (Though years had bedded these, and driven them deep Into his curdling flesh,) led forth to gaze Once more on Heaven and earth, and all their pompsâ Their mysteries of great beauty, and their triumphsâ (Profusion of enchantments!âand to him Then seeming miracles of that Hour's making!)â So gloryingly took gladness to his Soulâ As Iâthat heard thy tidings with such depthâ Such awe of happinessâas changed my nature!â From that deep hour, I was another being!â (The happiness indeed was of that kind Which brings a solemn mood, and not a mirthful.) I had been ever, both in joy and sorrowâ A child of impulseâan elastic beingâ Ruled by the unfixed complexion of the moment!â But after that great shock of solemn gladnessâ My thoughts took shapes at once, when they arose, Within my mind, which they retained for ever, As though Life's roots had deepened, and its shoots Had hardenedâstrengthenedâfrom that sovereign hour!â Thenceforward!âOh!âthenceforward all appeared Of momentâall of meaning to my Soul!â No more with shifting hues the hours past byâ Nor shifting shadowsânor scarce-'stablished formsâ All was as though it was for everlasting!â Oh! Father!âthou wert, as it were, the Parent Of thisâmy Soul's new life!â Jero. And thou, dear Daughter!â The kind Preserver of my Mortal Oneâ From that same hour thou ne'er relaxed'st thine effortsâ Ne'er paused in thy kind offices of helpâ The gentlest nurse that ever sufferer hadâ The enfeebled spark of life by thy mild breath Was blownâand blown, once more into a flame, And still it shall be consecrate to thee, And thy best weal for evermore!âNow say!â Hast guarded well, with care that they require, Those papers I committed to thy hands?â Detailing all the circumstance attending That dark conspiracy 'gainst trusting Virtueâ And how, when entering on the eleventh hour, Compunctious tremblings spoke the awakening conscienceâ And checked performance of the deed designedâ (Though still pretended to be carried through)â Hast guarded well the scroll?â Inez. With strictest care The papers are preserved, like life-dear treasure!â No more!âI must be gone!âI must to Florence!â Wilt wend, kind Father! thitherwards with me? Jero.

Though Fiorilina's hand be thy reward?â Milla. Ah! sweetest Fiorilina!âcould she see The forty Volumesâand the Funeral Vault!â But by the way! I heard to-day such tidings As shake me in my wish to marry herâ 'Tis said the family place of sepulture Is strangely shabbyâscarce three ells of velvet On all the coffins thereâthe plates tooâpaltry!â Lam. (laughing.) Away! I jeer myself with maniac mockery!â A hissing Devil laughs in my despairâ But now that mood is past, and it is well!â Come!âdeathly Vengeance! sweep into my Soul With all your brooding shadows of the grave!â Milla. (aside.) 'Twere best I left himâhe is raving, raving!â I never fancied much the talk of madmenâ My ancestors like me were sane and sage!â [Exit Millaflores. Lam. What ho! who waits?âwhat, Nicolo!â Enter Nicolo. Nico. My Lord!â Lam. This instant seek the notaryâsend him here Without delay!â Nico. I will not spare my speed. [Exit Nicolo. Lam. I have resolved, my whole of worldly wealth, (Save a most humble sum reserved,) at once To yield up to Lorenzoâto my Nephewâ For such he shall beâlet who will oppose it!â Henceforth I feel my life will darkly be, A chaos of all strifes, and stratagems!â The doom is on meâand it must be so!â My punishments shall never fall on thee, Costanza!ânever!âand the boundless wealth To whichâthy Brother lostâmyself succeededâ And which when I am gone, shall come to theeâ Transferred for my Life's length unto thy Lordâ Shall be preserved from fine or confiscation!â Henceforth I feel I am a dark adventurerâ A masked intriguerâvisionary schemer!â The game I only played atâI will actâ Act in right earnest, bearded thus and braved!â Look to it!âlook!âmy Prince!âfor thouâthou hast made Thy faithful subjectâthy determined foe!â Unchangedâirreconcileableâand desperate!â My hate for himâthis smooth-cheeked striplingâsoon (When he has gained his portion and deserts,) Shall be transferred to theeâthou service-scorner!â Thou trampler of these hairs of grey! thou tyrant!â Thou who thus think'st it rests with thee alone, To be the setter-up and taker-down Of men whose minds are 'stablished, and assuredâ Once great and ever great!âonce trusted, honoured, To be for ever honouredâever trusted!â Enter Visconti. This is most kind, my Friend!âmy little leisure Prevented me from seeking thee to-dayâ Thou mightst well think I should be glad to see thee!â Vis. I fear my presence will be deemed less welcome, When I confess to thee I come to plead For thy poor ward, thy sweet adopted child. Lam. What mean'st thou?â Vis. This! there can be little doubt The bright Costanza loves not young Lorenzoâ And thou wouldst wed her 'gainst her gentle will To himâwho never can receive her Heart!â Choice should be left her in such heart-dear matter!â Lam. Thou know'st she fanciesâthe object of this choice Is this pernicious meddlerâthis Algarvesâ Even he, the unknown and the unsuspected Brother!â For such I feel convinced he is in truth!â When he is lost to sight, as he shall beâ Conveyed from Florence, as he needs must beâ And I have trumped some story up, shall serve To lull suspicion 'gainst myself, and rouse Suspicions dark and mystical 'gainst him!â Her dream-born love will gradually give way, And she will yet be happy with Lorenzo!â Vis. At least coerce her not, nor yet speed on The ceremonial of her dreaded marriage!â No! by thy love for her!â Lam. And by that love I feel I must speed on that wished conclusionâ Henceforth my Life is hurryâfuryâtroubleâ She must be sheltered under roof more sure!â My love for her!âaye! 'tis a love that mocketh The petty passion of the puling Loverâ A rooted, holy, high, paternal loveâ And more than that, a gratitude profoundâ Long years of gladness and of healthful interests I owe to herâsince she became my childâ Herself was made, by her exalting influence, As 'twere the Maiden-Mother of my Soul!â In her perpetual presence sweet and sacredâ It sprang into a better, loftier lifeâ A higher state!â Vis. Ah! sacrifice her not!â Lam. Myself far sooner!âbut thou much mistakest!â To change the theme, hast thou yet learned, my Friend, Algarves' new appointment?â Vis. Yes!âI have heard it, But scarcely credited the taleâis't true?â Lam. As true as hell, if that at least may be True in all ruinous realities!â Vis. Thou bear'st it nobly!â Lam. Do I so?âI didâ By dedicating at the time when first I heard itâthe ignominious infamy!â His blood and mine, to all the Infernal Gods!â Vis. Nay! nay!âthou rav'stâspare speech!âthy niece approaches!â Enter Costanza. Save thee, sweet Lady!âin thy looks I read That thou hast communications for the Count, Of nature confidential and peculiarâ I haste to rid thee of my needless presence!â [Exit Visconti. Lam. Hast thou heard too, my childâhast thou yet heard, How this vile plotterâthis pestiferous minionâ This base intriguerâand this servile place-manâ The worm that calls himself Algarvesâspeeds?â Hast heard that the office I myself demandedâ (Demanded too with instance and entreaty, Because I felt peculiarly 'twas suited To what I dared deem mine especial talent,) Is given unto that beardless boy?â Cos. Alas!â Lam. Alas!âis that thy sole remark!âSpeak!âsay!â Canst feel no sacred fire glow in thy breast At this recital of my mortal wrong?â (Passionately.)Curse him! Costanza!âlet me hear thee curse him!â Cos. Oh! but forgive him!â Lam. Yes! when earth no more Shall be encumbered with his hateful life!â Cos. His life! touch not his life!â Lam. Ha! shall I not!â Whose life then?âprithee! listen!âdoom for doom!â What is the dark price of the Soul's own blood?â That price must yet be paidâthe fate fulfilled!â I am made Bankrupt of the Soul for ever!â Who, 'midst his new friendsâflatterersâfollowersâfools, Will take his place and suffer in his steadâ Who will groan out their souls for his remorse, Who bear disgrace for himâdie for him?â Cos. I!â Lam. Thou!âthou'rt disgraced, enough, by even that thought!â Die for him?âHark!âI tell theeâand 'tis trueâ As he and hell are falseâif in exchangeâ If in his stead, ten thousand tens of thousands Offered themselves, I would not yield my victim!â Cos. (weeping.) Thy victim! but thou mean'st it not!â Oh! no!â Thou art too good, too kind, too just!â Lam. Too just!â And too unjustly used!âyes! yes!âthou'rt right!â Thou'rt right!âI am too just, and will be soâ And he shall feel the justice I will deal him!â Nothing and none shall save him from my hate!â Cos. Suffer me leave thee, for I scarce can stand!â My limbs seem melting with unwonted tremoursâ Mine eyes seem darkening with unnatural filmsâ My brain grows blind with unaccustomed mists!â Lam. Begone then!âand forget to say forgive!â [Exit Costanza. Nothing and none shall save him!âI will go And challenge him this nightâthis very nightâ Though he were fifty times my Brother's Sonâ And thine, Luigiaâsaint and sufferer! thine!â 'Tis strange that melts me not!âbut true, in him Is nought that mindeth in the least of her!â His eyeâa deep dark fire!âhis browâa throne Of haughty thoughts and wild ambitious dreamsâ His proud curved lipâno! nothing there is thineâ And nothing in the Soul!âmy lost Luigia!â My mightyâmelancholy love for thee Is all Costanza's!âshe is indeed thy child!â Thou wert the mother of her heart and aspect!â Now Vengeance!âVengeance!âlead me where thou wiltâ I follow! to the Heart of Hell would follow!â [Exit Lambertazzi. Scene IV. âA Street in Florence near the Baptistery; a small Chapel near. Enter Algarves. Al. My Mother and the Priest are not yet comeâ Here let me wait for my adored Costanza. How like is love to fear!âor how much fear Doth still remain with true and fervent Love!â Hist! steps!â'twere best I did conceal myself, Till sweet Costanza steals from forth the festaâ Enter Lambertazzi. Lam. Come forth, thou shrinking skulker!âcrouching there, By ev'ry fear oppressed!âcome forth, thou villain!â Thy coward conscience well may hold thee backâ But I will have thee forward!âForth!âI say!â Al. What mean'st thou, Lambertazzi?âknow'st me not?â Lam. Because I know thee thus, I name thee, thusâ I strive to name thee, but 'tis vainâin sooth, Man never yet found name for such a wretch!â Al. My whole Soul soars above thy petty insults!â Lam. Above them! aye! I cannot coin such terms For hate and horror and reproach and scorn, But that thy Soul will soar above them all In unapproachable, unfancied vileness!â Invader of my rights!âcome on!âcome on!â Thou treacherous, viperous wretch!â Al. (aside.) At such an hour!â Oh! Heaven!â Lam. Come on!âdefend thyself!â Al. Pass!âpass!â Old man! grey hairs defend thee!â Lam. Worm! thou dar'st not!â Al. No!âno! I dare not!âreverend age hath traced A holy circle round thee, and I see The shadow of Great Death already there, And dare not hasten itâby human meansâ Dare not anticipate the dread decreeâ Which seems already half pronounced against thee!â The finger of thy God is on thee!âyea!â I dare not lay mine thereâtoo visibly That awful finger's trace on age is seen!â If I could so forget myself indeed, My changed pale hours should start like phantoms up, And fling back Parthian darts of doom for ever!â Lam. Thou'rt a rank coward!â Al. I am a coward there!â I tremble in the Presence of the Power Who made me!â Lam. Draw! I say!â Al. Put up, I bid thee Put up, put upâI tell thee, and then hear!â Lam. No!âI hear nothing!âdar'st thou love Costanza?â Al. Yes! to the roots and reaches of my Soul!â Lam. Most wretched boy!â Al. No!âhappier, happier far, In that dear Love's despair, (if 'twas despair,) Than all delights could make me!â Lam. No! thou'rt wrong!â Thou wrongly lov'st, and still thou art wrong to loveâ I tell theeâbeardless stripling!âthat thou'rt wrong!â Al. Then the Universe is so!âfor that is Love!â Then the Universe is so!âwhose Harmony, Whose Beauty, Truth, and Power, are born of Loveâ Are born of the all-enduring Love!âfor ever!â Go to!âold man!âThy words are weakâPeace!âPeace!â Lam. No! war with thee!âstrife!âwar!âev'n to the deathâ Thy death of body, and thy death of Soul!â Thy Love's a love accursed!â Al. Ha! dar'st thou say it!â My love's a love angelic!â Lam. I could tell thee, That which would make thee shrink in shuddering horror From her thou lov'st!â Al. 'Tis not in NatureâNO!â Lam. I tell theeâyes!â Al. (aside.) It hisses to my Soul!â It chills my heartâaway!âBut thou canst not!â Lam. I can!â Al. Thou do not or thou diest!â Lam. 'Tis well!â What! have I warmed theeâPetrifaction?âheigh!â What! have I thawed the dull blood in thy veins?â Al. No! frozen it to fate!â Lam. Come! come then, draw!â One moment pause to thank my mild forbearanceâ I will not wound with breath, as I might doâ But mercifully use the sword instead!â Not kill thy Soul ere from the body drivenâ (As fiends shall do in their appointed season)â Words I will spare, such words as I could useâ Words that would wound thy spirit unto death!â Thou'lt brook cold iron better!ânow stand forth!â Come!âTo your guardâa host of Hate stands 'gainst thee!â [They fight; after a few passes Alphonzo falls mortally wounded. Al. Costanza! oh! my Love!â'tis done! I die!â Costanza!âoh! my Bride!â Lam. (starting.) Thy Bride!âworse horror!â Retract thy words!â Al. She would have been this night!â Lam. Thank Heaven! that spared you both!â Al. That spared!âoh! mercy!â No! I am sped!â'tis wonderful! 'tis strange!â Ev'n as I faint in death I feelâI feelâ A deep flow in of tenderness towards thee, My enemy, my ruthless foe, my slayer!â Reach me thy hand a moment here, I pray thee!â Give me thy prayers and blessings ere I go!â Lam. My blessing!âI have given it thee in blood!â My prayers!âcould they in sooth ascend to Heaven With the foul reekings of this sacrifice!â My hand,â'tis dripping with thy heart's best drops!â Al. Reach me thy hand, and give thy blessing!â Lam. Nay!â My lips refuse to send itâyet oh! yet I may notâmust notâcannot dare refuse!â Bless thee, unhappy boy!â Al. I die in peace!â But yet one form seems beckoning from the graveâ How can I die and go from theeâCostanza!â 'Tis vain to struggleâvain!â [Dies. Lam. My soul is changed!â The hate hath died from it, ev'n with his death!â But Oh! I am all horror!âcan it be?â Am I indeed a murtherer?âis it bloodâ Blood shed by me that crimsons thus the ground?â Are these grey hairs all desecrated now With crime so fiend-like?âI so near the graveâ Dared I send one all promiseâin his primeâ To be my herald to the mould'ring mansions?â Remorse is gnawing meâdespair o'ertakes me!â Enter Costanza. Cos. I tremble strangely!âha! my fear is fate!â A cold unconscious corse upon the groundâ 'Tis himâmy Husbandâmurdered!â Lam. I can give But one most hideous consolationâhark! And bless the pitying Heavens these rites were stopped!â Thy chosen Husbandâhe who lieth thereâ Dust of the dust in deathâhe was thy Brother!â Cos. My Brother! worse than misery!âhave we been Unconsciously such deadly, deadly sinners!â Such criminals of the heart! Algarves! Brother!â I know not whether to rejoice or weepâ But either way must maddenâ'tis all madness!â I am thrice stabbedâand yet 'tis not enoughâ I cannot die, though I am three times stabbedâ In theeâand himâand in myself!âOh! share, Beloved! that blood-red steel with me, at least, For all my thoughts are murders!âDeath is dead!â [She swoons. Enter Inez veiled. Inez. What sight is this?âwhyâwhat hath happened here?â Who lieth on the ground, hurt, bleeding, dead?â Heaven! Heaven! is't thou?âoh! thou! mine own?â'tis thou!â [Flinging herself on the ground. Wake!âsmile on me!âlook up!âspeakâstand!âthou liv'st!â I say thou liv'st!âI will not let thee die!â Lam. Are the graves opening to disgorge their dead!â What spectre stands before me?â Inez. Thou art thereâ Thou! Lambertazzi!âwert too late to save him?â Oh! seek for help!âAlas! 'twere vain!â'tis death!â (Starts up.) Why! who hath done this savage horror?âsayâ Not that pale thing all swooned away in anguish!â What midnight murtherer hath been here at work?â Pursue him!âgrind him into gory dust!â Who? who?âalas! most wretched Parents!â Lam. Parents?â Whose Son is he?âsay! know'st thou?â Inez. Mine!â Lam. Whose? Inez. Ours!â Lam. (falling on the earth.) Now swallow me, slow earth! and be one grave!â (Starts up.)What art thouâPhantom?â Inez. None!âI am thine Inez!â Enough!âwhat matters aught save him!âavenge him!â Must he lie weltering there and unavenged?â Who did the hideous dread-outmonstering deedâ The impossible and nameless slaughter?â Lam. I!â Inez. Mock not a maddened miserable wretch!â Who murderedâbutchered himâstabbedâslew?â Lam. I!âI!â His Father!âI! ev'n I, his Father!âI!â Thou toldst me to avenge himâbad'st me smite That desperate villain who had done the deedâ 'Tis now my turn to speak,âmy time to urgeâ [Snatching the dagger and opening his vest. Do thou!â [She starts, snatches the dagger and points it at him: a pause; she tosses it from her. Inez. (laughing horribly.) Aye do it! childless Mother! do it!â No!âsounds shall be my swords!âbehold thy Son!â Aye! thy legitimate and noble Son!â The marriage which thou deemedst a mockeryâknow!â Through the compunction of the Priest was real! This long I knew not,âand myself agreed, As wished my Parents, thou shouldst think me dead. This Priest o'erta'en by sickness, dreading death,â Me summoned to his couch, his Soul disburthened!â He died notâand hath sped to Florence now, To clear all doubts away, and speak all truth!â Enter Jeronymo. Behold him!â Jero. Sacred Heaven! a scene of blood!â Inez. My Son's heart-blood, and shed too by his Father!â Oh!âI have sunkâsunk to the earth's very centre!â Jero. So passions darken with the deepening Lifeâ And where was lawless love,âreligion's mockeryâ See!âstart the rampant murther!â Lam. Say! oh! Priest!â One wrong the less is on my ruined Soulâ This injured woman is my wife!â Jero. She is!â Though I consented to your hateful scheme, My conscience hindered me from the impious outrage, While lacked I courage of a nobler virtue!â Thou art most truly wedded unto her Who stands before thee in a swoon of Soul!â Lam. How came Algarves to possess the picture The heir of Andrea ever wore?â Jero. The nurse Hath stated oft to me, the children playing, Exchanged their dresses, and the treasured picture, Representation of Luigia Cenci, Hung round Algarves' neck at that sad hour, By strange remissness never was restored Unto the rightful infantine proprietorâ Later, he wore it by his Mother's wish. Lam. Oh! Heaven!âhow blest I might have been!âand now My Soul is scarlet with thy blood, poor boy!â My Child!âmy Son!âmy found-lostâdead-alive!â And loathed and murderedâto be loved too late!â Thy bloodâit rises in a reddening deluge, Drowning all thingsâall thoughts!âIt cannot be!â I say 'tis not my Son!â'tis some wild errorâ If this is he, then where is Andrea's heir?â Jero. Hush!âhark!âsome reveller from Diodati's Palace!â Lam. I care not!âwhere's the Son of Andrea?â Enter Lorenzo. Inez. (looking up.) There!â Loren. Hath some sad chance befallen?ânay, how is this?â Oh!âis't a chance, or some most dreadful sin? Algarves!âdrowned in blood!âwhat deed is this? Lam. I cannot tell thee, for it hath no nameâ And if it had, I could not tell thee! no!â The eternal Heavens would start from their foundations, And fall in ruins o'er the ruined world, If that was namedâthough they could bear to seeâ And unremonstrant bear to see it done!â Inez. (starting up.) But let me while I yet have breath to speak, Sense to observe,âor strength to frame such words, Do one plain act of justice to this youth, Revealing truths which (Heaven forgive me for't!) I meant to bury deep in long oblivion!â But I am punished as ne'er mortal yetâ Know!âthou art the Son of Andrea Lambertazziâ Heir to the enormous wealth he left behind him!â The restâif life yet lastsâwill I reveal Through certain papers of authentic worth!â Loren. One word!âby whom was I in childhood seized?â Inez. Count Sforza, deadly foe to all your house, Who finally made you his fortune's master!â My Sonâdiscovered to be mineâwas sent, On promise given of secrecy, to Spain!â Loren. Yet one word moreâhow knew'st thou me?âdeclare!â Inez. The Spanish nurse who had my child in charge Did recognize you by your right cheek's markâ 'Twas even sheâ(by chance you passed us by,) Did point you out to meâbesides, 'tis known You were the adopted Son of Sforzaâheir To all his wealth, his houses, and his land!â I guessed 'twas reparation and remorse, And not gratuitous generosity!â Embrace thy Sisterâthere she lies!âshe wakes!â Loren. My Sisterâthee! Costanza! sweetest Sister!â Cos. Where waits the Priest?âwhere stays the Bridegroom?âTHERE!â Oh! thou dear DeathâI see thee!âstill be mine!â Yet wed us, Priestâthe Dead unto the Dead!â For all my Soul is frozen like his frame!â Jero. Behold thy Brother!âAndrea's long-lost heir!â Embrace him in Lorenzo!â Cos. (very faintly.) Is it so?â Lorenzo! dear Lorenzo! there is one Who loves thee better far than life, and thatâ Is Fiorilina di Diodati!âyetâ Let there be something like a shadowy dream Of Happiness on Earth!âmay I yet find itâ Far, far away in Heaven!âbut what! there comes A maddening memory creeping o'er my brain!â 'Twas not so then!âit is not so!âno! no!â Algarves was not then my Brother!â Jero. Nay!â Thy Cousin, Lady!â Cos. Heaven be praised for that!â And yet I feel his death the deeper!âhis!â Mine own! I feel too! creeping coldly on!â Oh! blessed thought! to join us two once more!â Death!âthou'rt a dazzling angel in mine eyes!â E'en in the sky, the glad and deathless Heaven Beyond that sunânow blackeningâblackeningâ [She dies. Jero. Peace!â All Peace be with theeâblessed parted spirit!â Thou hast been sorely tried!âSleep! wounded Dove!â Fold up the tender whiteness of thy wings!â Forget the stormâthe arrow and the nightâ The clouds,âthe gloom,âthe wild of desolation!â Heaven that hath faded from thy longing sight, Hath surely opened on thy blameless Soulâ All blessings on thy slumbers virginalâ Thy slumbers of the Spring's own days of flowering!â Bright smiled the blossom, but no fruit was destined!â The Dove and Lily are thy sweetest emblemsâ Oh! young and gentle daughter, sleep in peace!â [Thunder is heard. Inez. (starts up wildly.) Ho! hark!âthe chariots of the angels rolling!â The avenging angels terrible in glory! Right o'er our heads!â'tis sultry! sultry!âstifling!â Prepare the funeralâthere is Death beside you!â What! do you leave your corses in the streets, And trample on their ashes?âShame! shame! shame!â Nay! hold me not!âI am not mad!ânot mad!â But thou art surely!âthou old hoary man!â That dost so glare on me!âNow take thy child!â Thou never didst! thou know'st!âHush! wake him not!â What! thou'st baptized him in his own young blood! Poor Innocent!âHippolito!âour Son!â He called himself Alphonzo to mislead thee!â 'Twas but by my command, so be not angry!â Oh! be not angry with thy blameless child!â And I was called Estrella di Monaco, That none might guess at the Estremaduran Inezâ 'Twas my Friend's nameâthat sweet Friend diedâalas!â Methinks all Friends are dead,âdead, cold, and silent!â And be ye very sureâand yeâand yeâ I dared not take it till my fame was clearedâ My murdered fame!âfor he who slew that boy, My best and beauteous one, destroyed me onceâ By clouding o'er my name and fame in darknessâ So that I was a loathing to myselfâ So that I felt a sinner who was none!â So that to others I became a shame!â [Thunder. Again! we are summoned!âwho shall first be judged? Again!âthe hour is come!âwho stands for sentence?â Blood-guiltiness is not upon my Soul!â Lam. Murdered thy fame!âindeed!âI did, poor victim!â And now thy mind is murdered!âstill by me!â For this is phrenzy!âSpare! spare me a part!â Oh! to see darkly, what to clearly see Is agony that crushes down the Soul Into the tainted clayâthe corse-like clay Of this corruption, whence true life departs, And leaves one mingling corse of mould and soul!â Inez!âthe Unhappiest!âthis is well for thee!â Inez. Peace! heard ye not the thunderâjudgment!âjudgment!â Here am I, and my Murdered!âOh! I fall!â What! Raphael Lambertazzi!âhast slain me too?â Yes! thou hast ploughed my heart up!âHasten! Death!â My child awaits me in the graves below!â Come quicker, Death!âcold pang by pang needs patience!â Come, thou sweet angelâin my child's dear form!â [Snatches up Lambertazzi's dagger. Oh! 'tis my blood upon itâthineâmineâOURS!â My Son's and thy Son's!âI will drink it now!â Aye! drink it with my bursting, burning Heart!â [She stabs herself, and dies. Lam.
