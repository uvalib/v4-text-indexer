      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. THE MOORISH CADI'S HOUSE IN GRANADA. A crowd of Moorish men and women are discovered on the stage, dressed in their national costume, the former with their peculiar head-dress and loose trousers, the latter in white doublets; some of them carrying musical instruments. To them Enter the CADI and ALCUZCUZ. CADI. Are the doors securely fastened? ALCUZCUZ. Yes, the doors are quite secure. CADI. Let none in without the password, And the zambra may proceed; Let us celebrate our sabbath, Which is Friday, in the way That our nation loves to keep it, That the Christian race, among Whom we live in wretched thraldom, May have no excuse to-day, To revile or reprehend us For our sacred rite. ALL. Begin! ALCUZCUZ. I will break my legs to splinters, When I enter into the dance! A MOOR sings. Although in sad captivity, Through Allah's righteous mystery, The Moorish race weep bitterly The wretched breath they draw,â ALL. Long live his law!â ANOTHER sings. Live the memory of the glorious And the laurel-crowned laborious Battles, when o'er Spain victorious, Her captive form we saw,â ALL. Long live his law!â ALCUZCUZ sings. Live the memory of brave Muza, And that fight in Andalusa, When old Spain could not refuse a Welcome to stout Africa,â ALL. Long live his law!â [A loud knocking is heard within. CADI. What is this? ONE. They force an entrance. CADI. Doubtless they desire to seize us In our meetings, since the king Has commanded by his edicts That we should be watched; the law, Seeing to this house repairing Such a crowd of Moors, comes hither In pursuit. ALCUZCUZ. Then let us fly:â CADI. Why, my friends, delay to open Unto him who calls so boldly? ALCUZCUZ. Vainly knocks he at the door, Who knocks not at the heart before. ONE. What is to be done? CADI. Concealing All the instruments, then open, Saying, that 'twas but to see me You came here. ANOTHER MOOR. A good excuse. CADI. Let us therefore all dissemble,â Alcuzcuz! fly, what delays you? ALCUZCUZ. Why, the door I fear to open, Lest a hundred blows of the cudgel I should get upon the stomach From the alguazil: 'twere wrong, Since they call me a Jack-pudding, Whacks, not pudding, I should get. Alcuzcuz quibbles here upon his name in a way that is impossible to be translated literally. Alcuzcuz was a favourite dish with the Moors, and was composed of flour, water, and honey made into balls. Enter DON JUAN MALEC. MALEC. Do not fear. CADI. My lord Don Juan! Whose pure blood of Malec gives you Still the magisterial rank In the city of Granada, Though of African descent, Can it be, my lord, you enter Thus my house? MALEC. No small occasion Makes me seek you here to-day:â 'Tis enough to say, that hither Draws me now mine own disgrace. CADI, aside. 'Tis no doubt to reprehend us That he comes. ALCUZCUZ, aside. Oh! that is naught,â Which were worse, to apprehend us Or to reprehend us, pray? CADI. What are your commands? MALEC. Abandon, All of you, my friends, the fear That my coming has occasioned; Entering to-day the council, We received a missive, sent From the chamber of King Philip, By the president himself, To the end, that all the mandates It imposes, should forthwith By the city be effected:â Being opened, the official Secretary of the council Read it with uplifted voice, And the whole of the instructions It contained, at once were ordered, To your greatest wrong: How truly Call they Time and Fortune twins! Since the two, for good or evil, On one wheel and with two pinions Ever move and never stay! Of the orders thus transmitted, Some are old and some are new, All of them revived or written In a spirit most malign; The effect of which is briefly,â That no African, or one Sprung from that renownÃ©d nation, Which to-day is but the ashes Of that once unconquer'd flame Which devoured this Spain: henceforward Can their festivals observeâ Hold their zambrasâwear silk dressesâ Use the public bathsâor speak, Even in their private dwellings, In their own Arabic languageâ But the strange Castilian tongue. I, from being the most agÃ©d Of the members present, thought That it was my right and duty To speak first, and so I said, That however just the edict, And how wise the end might be, So that all the Moorish customs, One by one might disappear,â That however was no reason For the harshness now imposed, And that if the law proceeded, In the case, with moderation, Needless violence avoiding, All these customs soon might fail. Then Don Juan de Mendoza, He who is allied so closely To the house of the great Marquis De MondÃ©jar, thus replied:â âNot impartially, Don Juan Speaketh thus, since nature prompts him To espouse his kindred's cause; Therefore would he stay and lighten This just judgment on the Moors,â A base, degraded, abject people!ââ âMy lord Don Juan de Mendoza,â Said I then, âwhen Spain was held Captive, 'neath the Moorish standards, Even on its native soil, Even then some Christians mingled With the Arabs, who since then, From this cause, are called Mozarabs, Unto whom no degradation Or no infamy hath come, For to no such height of glory Fortune rises, not even when It subdues and conquers evils, As when it doth bear them well. And however poor and humble Be a crushed and captive peopleâ Moorish cavaliers are not Less than Christian knights, the moment They receive baptismal water, And admission to the one Holy Catholic religion; And especially among them Those who claim to have, as I, Kings for their progenitors:ââ âAye,â said he, âbut Moorish kings:ââ âWhat!â I answer'd, âis the Moorish Blood that mantleth in the veins Of the Zegris and Granadas, The Valores and Venegasâ Is it, I repeat, bereft Of its rich and royal nature, Now that they are Christian men?â Thus one word produced another, Since, there meeting without swords, They could speak and I should listen; Oh! accursÃ©d be the chance! Thrice accursÃ©d the occasion! That instead of swords, we fought with Clashing disputatious tongues, Though they are the deadlier weapons, Since wounds heal before a word: Something here I must have added, Which increased his arrogance, For (I tremble to relate it!) He then snatching (oh! the pain!) Out of my hands my staff of office, With it..... oh! enough! enough! Since some sorrows cost us greater Pain to tell than to endure. Now this outrage which I suffered In defending you, this wrong, Which, your natural rights sustaining, I alone endured, doth reach Every one of us united:â For I have no son, whose hand Might remove this foul dishonour From these thin and snow-white hairs; I have but a daughterâshe, Once my joy but now my sorrow:â Well, then, brave and noble Moorsâ Precious relic of our nationâ Since the Christians' only object Is to make our whole race slavesâ Since we hold the Alpujarraâ That sierra, which so proudly Lifts its tall head to the sunâ And with towns all peopled over, Seems a sea of rocks and plants, With its fortresses like vessels Sailing over silver waves; Which their very namesâGalera, Berja, and Gabia say:â These towns in the Alpujarra range of mountains having names which also bear a nautical signification, suggested this conceit to Calderon. Since this tract is ours, then hither Let us fly with arms and stores; Choose a chieftain from the ancient And unblemished noble race Of your own AbenhumÃ©yas, Since Castile preserves them still, And thus turn from slaves to masters. I myself, though dear 'twill cost me, Will go round, convincing all, That 'tis infamyâ'tis baseness To partake in my disgrace And partake not in my vengeance. [Exit. CADI. For the deed thou meditatest.... A MOOR. For the action that you plan.... CADI. Life and wealth I freely offer. [Exit. A MOOR. I can give but life and soul. [Exit. ANOTHER MOOR. Every Moorish man will do so. [Exit. A MOORISH WOMAN. I, for all the Moorish women That Granada doth contain, Offer all our silks and jewels. ALCUZCUZ. I who've but a little store Of odds and ends in Bivaramblaâ Vinegar, sweet figs and oilâ Almonds, raisins, garlic, pepper, Ribbons, onions, nuts, and brooms Made of the palm-tree, threads and needles, Pouches, paper white and brown, Caraways, dogs' leather collars, Snuff, tobacco, sticks and twigs, Quills for making pens, and wafers To seal lettersâall must I Now upon my shoulders carry With a thousand other trifles; Just to see if fortune reaches To the summit of my hopes, That is, of all the Alcuzcuzes To be marquis, duke, or count:â A MOOR. Silence! you are mad. ALCUZCUZ. I am not Mad. ANOTHER MOOR. If not, the thing is clear That you're drunk. ALCUZCUZ. Nor drunk, sir, thank you:â Since Mahomet, our great prophet, Ordered in his Alcoran That no wine should e'er be drunken, I ne'er drank itâby my eyes! But if any time it pleased me, Not to break a good old custom, I just hid itâby my beard! [Exeunt. SCENE II. âA ROOM IN MALEC'S HOUSE. Enter DOÃA CLARA and BEATRICE. CLARA. Beatrice, permit me still To weep my pains and breathe my sighsâ They owe this little to mine eyes, So let my griefs their fountains fill; And since I have not power to kill Him, who has dared, with evil eye, To blast mine honour once so highâ Or from my heritage of shame Redeem my late unspotted name, Let me at least, in pity, die; Alas! how abject, oh! how base The fatal gifts that Nature gave usâ Gifts that but the more enslave usâ Wit and loveliness and grace, Which perchance may tempt disgrace, But to keep honour safe, are vain. Ah! what greater source of pain Than to have power to take at will Honour from sire or spouse, and still Have none to give it back again? If I were born a man, 'twere seen, Granada and the world would see, If Mendoza to-day would be As brave before a young man's mien, As with an old man he has been.â Perhaps I may with him disclaim My sex's weaknessâwithout shame Ask satisfaction as my right, For he who would an old man fight, Would with a woman do the same: But ah! my foolish hope is vain, Its sole achievement is to speakâ Oh! that my hands were not too weak, My own revenge at once to gain! And now, alas! a greater pain, A greater trial waiteth meâ Doomed in one wretched day to be Deprived at once of sire and spouse, Since I would shame the bridal vows Of Don Alvaro TuzanÃ­. Enter DON ALVARO. ALVARO. An evil augury, I fear, Portending woe to hope and love, Beautiful Claraâthis will prove, That on thy lips my name I hear, For, if the voice should be the mere Echo, the inward thought express'd Audibly of the soulâconfess'd Truly by tears as now, 'tis plain That I must cause thy bosom's pain, Since you thus cast me from thy breast. CLARA. Denial now were worse than vain; My heart is full of pains 'tis true, Thou art amongst them, think if you Can be perchance its slightest pain; Since Heaven has torn our loves in twain, Think if thou art its greatest rather;â I cannot be thy wife, nor gather Disgraceful flowers to strew thy bed. For thou canst never stoop to wed The child of a dishonoured father. ALVARO. Clara, I no inclination Have to remind you now how long I have loved you with a strong And a respectful adoration, I only wish on this occasion, To explain why I can be Here to-day, and thou still see Thy wrong without its due atonement; It is because this brief postponement I have allowed through love to thee; Though for a lady's conversation The duel is no fitting themeâ And though perchance a little gleam I might impart, of consolation To thy sorrow, thy vexationâ By saying it hath no pretence To wake your tears, or even the sense Of having suffered wrongâbecause What's done unarmed, and, by the laws Protected, cannot give offence. But on another point I rest, Having another reason why, How it so happens, here, that I Enter, before I have redressed (Piercing Mendoza's haughty breast) Your father's honourâa good deed, Even though it hath been long decreed:â No wrong is e'er avenged aright Save by the wronged one, in the fight Wherein the wrong-doer's heart must bleed: Or if not by himself, his son, Or at the least his brother's hand; And since his honour doth demand Vengeance which cannot else be wonâ I have to ask, that now be done The act for which I long have sighedâ It is that you become my bride. I go to ask Don Juan this:â Being his son, that tie of bliss Lets him, through me, be satisfied; Clara, for this alone, be sure That I came here: if I till now Timidly pressed you not to allow Our union,â'twas that I was poorâ This day's event the effect doth cure, Since I shall not by wish or tongue Ask aught that doth to thee belong By way of portion, but the right To avenge thy wrong: In the world's sight A poor man's portion be a wrong. CLARA. Don Alvaro, neither shall I Recall how long has been, and true My firm devotion unto youâ How I have loved you faithfully; Nor attempt to say I die Stricken to-day by a double knife, Nor, how duty and love at strife, Seek in this fleeting calm to control My heart: for thou art the life of my soul, Thou indeed art the soul of my life:â This alone I wish to say, In all this trouble, that she who would crave But yesterday to be thy slave, Will not become thy wife to-day, For if through diffidence yesterday You asked me not, and to-day you do, I to-day but owe it to you To refuse thee, lest the malign Breath of time could say, to be thine I needed some attraction new. Rich and honoured, once I thought I was unworthy of thy love, Happily as the event doth prove That unhappy feeling was nought But a suspicion. Think, now, ought I to-day to give to thee Instead of happiness, misery, Punishment instead of reward? As if I should be disgraced, my lord, Ere you would think to wed with me. ALVARO. To revenge thee my spirit woos thee. CLARA. Respect enforceth my rejection. ALVARO. Does not this, Clara, prove my affection? CLARA. Esteem, Alvaro, makes me refuse thee. ALVARO. You have no power now to excuse thee:â CLARA. I at the least have power to die. ALVARO. I shall tell Don Juan, that I Won your love. CLARA. And I shall deny it. ALVARO. Is this loyalty? CLARA. Honour lives by it. ALVARO. Is it truth? CLARA. 'Tis fidelity:â Since, by yonder heavens so pure I solemnly swear, never to be The wife of a man, until I see My honour once again secure. ALVARO. What imports that, if.... BEATRICE. No more, For, my lord, by the corridor, With some others comes this way. CLARA. Retire within this room, I pray:â ALVARO. What a mischance! [Alvaro enters the room, but is still visible to the audience. CLARA. It grieves me sore! Enter DON ALONZO DE ZUÃIGA the CORREGIDOR, DON FERNANDO VALOR, and DON JUAN MALEC. MALEC, aside to Clara. Clara! CLARA. My lord? MALEC, aside. Ah! woe is me! With what pain again to meet thee!â To that chamber there retreat thee. CLARA. What is this? MALEC. From that thou'lt see. [Clara and Beatrice retire to the room where Alvaro is concealed. CORREGIDOR. Don Juan de Mendoza lies Imprisoned in the Alhambra now: Till this affair blows o'er somehow, Don Juan Malec, it were wise That you within your house should stay, On your parole. MALEC. I freely give it, And as freely you may receive it, Since I shall keep it. VALOR. The delay Will not be much, since his lordship here, The corregidor, allows my endeavour (For in the duel of honour, never Should authority interfere) This ruffled sense of wrong to soothe, Hoping to make you friends once more. CORREGIDOR. SeÃ±or Fernando de Valor Skilfully thus, with a double truth, Reneweth honour's fancied stainsâ None ('tis the law) can insults fling Or in the palace of a King Or in the hall where Justice reigns, There, from the sacred strict duress, None of us all can e'er be free. VALOR. The means I have in view must be Successful.... ALVARO, aside to Clara. Do you hear this? CLARA, to Alvaro. Yes. VALOR. In fact no other means I see This disagreement to set right. MALEC, aside. Ah! honour, thou'rt in evil plight When thou dost need a remedy! VALOR. Don Juan de Mendoza is As brave a knight as ever carried Cross or coronet. He is unmarried: With a rank as proud as his, Don Juan de Malec, in whose veins Still flows Granada's royal blood, Has a daughter, by fame endowed With all that dazzles and enchainsâ Whom envy's self dare not disparage; If satisfaction for his wrong He still requires, it doth belong But to a son-in-law: this marriage 'Twixt DoÃ±a Clara and Don Juan Makes all secure. ALVARO, aside. Ah! woe is me:â VALOR, to Malec. No other way that I can see Can you repair your honour's ruin. For then your insult being extended To him, you must become the defenderâ As a third party, he is the offender, But as your son-in-law the offended:â There being no party then to claim Satisfaction from, and no ill to cure, With you the effect becomes secure, And with Don Juan Mendoza the same; For he not having then to give Death to himselfâin this immense Abyss, must hold his own offence In his own breast, and so forgive: So that the offence itself being gone,â No man being self-angry longâ Don Juan wisely guarding his wrongâ No one remains to take vengeance on:â This the honour of both will render Pure as before, since human eyes Never saw one person comprise Both the offended and the offender. ALVARO, to Clara. I will answer. CLARA, to him. For God's sake, stay; Let me not be destroyed by you. CORREGIDOR. This arrangement doth answer the two. MALEC. There is one obstacle in the way, Since the sacrifice honour demands, Against our hopes, may Clara refuse. CLARA, aside. Heaven itself approves of my views, Giving vengeance into my hands. MALEC. Since indeed I do not know That my daughter would wish to mate With a man she has reason to hate With such good cause. Enter DOÃA CLARA. I shall wish it so; Freely shall I the offering give, Since, my lord, it imports me less That I should live without happiness, Than that you without honour live: Because, if I had been thy son, I would have heard but anger calling, Bravely killing, or bravely falling; Being thy daughter, I have but one Way, by which can no more be deferred Satisfaction dearer than life:â And so I will become his wife:â From which act it may be inferred, That I am in this way trying To save thy honour, weakly but willing, And since I cannot revenge by killingâ I may, at least, do so, by dying. CORREGIDOR. Wit like thine could only draw out From the midst of so much confusion, Such a singular conclusion. VALOR. And the effect I do not doubt; But a letter must now be writ To him, according to our intent, Which I shall myself present. CORREGIDOR. And we likewise shall go with it. MALEC, aside. I shall use the time in preparation For the revolt that we intend. VALOR. All shall come to a happy end I firmly trust, through my mediation. [Exeunt the three. CLARA. Now that they have gone away To write the letter (woe the worth!) You may, Alvaro, now come forth. Enter DON ALVARO. ALVARO. Yes, I will do so, yes, to say That never shall I see again A soul so fickle in a breast So truly noble: I could rest (Though my heart's life ebbed fast away, Blood fled my cheek and sight mine eye) Within there, not through respect, nor dearth Of courage, but that on the earth A woman could be found...... CLARA. Ah! me. ALVARO. So bold, so light as to presume With broken faith, in accents bland, To offer to one man her hand, And have another in her room:â I did not wish it were believed I could love one, whose vows are vain. CLARA. Thy voice, Alvaro, oh! detain, For thou, indeed, art self-deceived: Which satisfactorily will appear After a little. ALVARO. A transaction Like this, can have no satisfaction. CLARA. You will find it can. ALVARO. Did I not hear You say, that you would give to-day Your hand to Mendoza? CLARA. Yes! 'tis so,â But you at present do not know Unto what end I so did say;â ALVARO. What end?âto kill me, let me see From what point an excuse you gather; Since dishonour he gives thy father, And my death he gives through thee. CLARA. Time, Alvaro, time will be able Some day or other to undeceive you, While I am constant and still believe you, Your faith in me has become unstable. ALVARO. Did any mortal ever yet know Such a subtle deceit? you confess Your hand, you said, you would give him? CLARA. Yes. ALVARO. Will you not be his wife then? CLARA. No. ALVARO. How reconcile this seeming strife...... CLARA. Vainly the mode you now demand. ALVARO. Clara, between giving your hand, And between becoming his wife? CLARA. To give him my hand, perchance, may be To draw him to my arms, that so I may inflict a deadlier blow: Are you satisfied now with me? ALVARO. No, for he dies amid your charms. O God!âit is a favour you give, Since thus to die, is more than to live; Because, Clara, your beauteous arms For executioners are so fair:â But before (although it may be Your intention) he there shall see Himself, he dies ere he get there:â Thus, my pains, I shall remedy, And your scorn, by this death of his. CLARA. Is this love? ALVARO. Honour it is. CLARA. Is this kindness? ALVARO. 'Tis jealousy. CLARA. See! my father has written the letter; Would that you could stay by my side! ALVARO. Ah! for me, near thee to abide, Were required, what a trifling fetter! [Exeunt. SCENE III. âTHE INTERIOR OF THE ALHAMBRA. Enter DON JUAN DE MENDOZA and GARCES. MENDOZA. In reason, anger never doth excel. GARCES. Blame not yourself, since you did very well To make him feel thy hand, Since this new Christian thought he might demand Immunity because of his old age, Thus with a proud Mendoza to engage. MENDOZA. Many there are, because of their high state Are haughty, proud, and inconsiderate. GARCES. It was for this, that the great constable Don IÃ±igo bore (the thought was admirable) One sword at his side, And one in his hand which thus a staff supplied; Being asked one day, Why he carried two swords in this way, He said, the one beside me, I prefer, For him who doth a similar weapon bear; The other, which as a staff I hold, For him who does not bear one and is bold. MENDOZA. Well may cavaliers be cautioned by these words That separate actions, call for separate swords; So that I may have power to parry, A thrust from either, give me the sword you carry; That whatever may occur I may not want a sword, although a prisoner. GARCES. I am delighted that I called to-day So opportunely here, as now I may Be able to serve you, should your foes presume. MENDOZA. How from Lepanto, This is an historical anachronism; the battle of Lepanto was subsequent to the revolt of the Moors in the Alpujarra. Garces, did you come? GARCES. As one whose fortune it has been To look upon that famous scene, And act a soldier's part In such a glorious proof of military art, Humbly indeed, but guided by the word Of him, Don John of Austria, the conqueror of Lepanto, was the natural son of Charles the Fifth, the âaguila divinaâ of the original text. the offspring of that royal bird Who in his wondrous flight of conquest, flings O'er all the world, the shadow of his wings. MENDOZA. How has Don John returned? GARCES. Content With the exploit. MENDOZA. Was it great? GARCES. The event I shall relate in full; the league with...... MENDOZA. Wait, For a veiled woman enters. GARCES. How unfortunate! I play reverses thus with my romance, The court-card enters and I lose my chance. Enter DOÃA ISABEL TUZANÃ, veiled. ISABEL. My lord Don Juan de Mendoza, May a woman, who comes hither, But to see you in your prison, Ask you of yourself, in private, How, imprisoned here, you are? MENDOZA. Why not, lady?âleave us, Garces. GARCES, aside. Look, my lord, perchance this person...... MENDOZA, aside. Vain your fears and your suspicions; Since she spoke, I recognise her. GARCES, aside. That being so I go. [Exit. MENDOZA. You may:â In a similar confusion Eyes and ears this moment hold me, For I know not of the two Which tell truth or which speak falsely, For, if I believe my eyesight, You appear not what you areâ And if I believe my hearing You are not what you appear, Deign to let me see uplifted This apparent subtle cloud Of dark crape, that then the dazzling Light which will come conquering through May proclaim to sight and hearing That to-day, the day dawns twice. ISABEL. Not to force your thoughts, Don Juan, To doubt longer who is she That thus seeks you, is the reason Why I show thee who I am, For my jealous heart disdaineth That through guessing you should err As to whom you owe this favour, I am...... [Raises her veil. MENDOZA. Isabel! SeÃ±ora!â Can it be, that to my dwelling, In this singular disguise, You have deigned to come and see me? How, oh! how can I indulge Hopes so sweet and so fallacious?â Since I know that I must doubt them. ISABEL. Scarcely I had learn'd what happened, And that you were here confined, When my love would not permit me To wait longer here to come, And before the going homeward Of my brother, Don Alvaro TuzanÃ­, I came to see thee, With a single maid alone, (Think now what it is you owe me) Who doth wait at the door. MENDOZA. To-day All my caresâmy sorrows vanish In this act of generous kindness, Yes, dear Isabel, by them...... Enter IÃES veiled, hurriedly, and as if frightened. INES. Ah! SeÃ±ora! ISABEL. What's this, IÃ±es? INES. Don Alvaro, even my lord Hither comes. ISABEL. What! could he know me Through this close disguise, as I Came along? MENDOZA. What great misfortune! ISABEL. If he followed me, I die!â MENDOZA. If you are with me, what fear you? Enter this adjoining hall, Close the door, and if he seeketh There to enter, ere he finds you He must leave me dead and cold. ISABEL. In this mighty peril standing, Aid me Heaven! in pity aid me!â [Isabel and IÃ±es conceal themselves. Enter DON ALVARO. ALVARO. My lord Don Juan de Mendoza, I wish to speak with you in private. MENDOZA. You perceive I am alone. ISABEL, at the side. Ah! how pale he looks and haggard! ALVARO. Then I may secure this door. MENDOZA. You can close it:â[aside] Fortune aids us. ALVARO. Now that it is closed, I pray That you hear me with attention. I have learned through accident That have now set out to seek you...... MENDOZA. You heard truly. ALVARO. In this prison...... MENDOZA. Your informant has not lied. ALVARO. In this action he offends me Who has life or soul to answer. ISABEL, aside. Can he speak with clearer meaning? MENDOZA, aside. Heavens! my doubts are at an end! ALVARO. So I have in haste come hither (Ere the others have arrived With the intention of reviving Friendships on disgraceful terms) To defend my outraged honour. MENDOZA. This I do not understand. ALVARO. Then I shall explain more clearly. ISABEL, aside. Once again my heart breathes freely, Since it is not me he seeks. ALVARO. The Corregidor attempts with Don Ferdinand de Valor, Kinsman of Don Juan Malec, To renew this broken friendshipâ And it is my sole concern To prevent it: and, my reasonâ Though a hundred I could mention, There is one I cannot tell:â And in fine, even though my motive Were but only a caprice, Still it is enough to ask you If thou art as brave with young men As with old men thou art bold; 'Tis for this alone I seek thee, Foot to foot to die, or kill. MENDOZA. You have done me a great favour, Thus so briefly telling me What you mean: because, this moment Wildered in a thousand ways, I conceived it was another Matter more important far; For the one that you have mentioned Is with me of small account: But since it is not my practice To refuse to fight with him Who desires with me to combat, Ere those kind ambassadors Who, you say, are coming, reach us, If the present time doth suit you, Draw your sword. ALVARO. For this I come; 'Tis more needful that I slay thee Quickly, than you could have thought. MENDOZA. Well, the field is fair and open. [They fight. ISABEL, aside. From one trouble to another My misfortunes make me fall; Who, a lover and a brother Could see fighting thus, without Any power to separate them? MENDOZA. What true courage! ALVARO. What great skill! ISABEL, aside. What indeed to do, I know not, Since I see two skilful players, And I wish the two success, Since they both alike affect me, Howsoe'er they win or lose. [DON ALVARO trips against a chair and falls; DOÃA ISABEL enters still veiled, and detains DON JUAN. ALVARO. Tripp'd up by this seat I've fallen. ISABEL. Oh! Don Juan, hold thy hand;â But what have I done? The impulse [Aside. Hurried me to act this way. [Retires. ALVARO. You did wrong in hiding from me, People were within that room. MENDOZA. If it was thy life to give thee, Do not thou complain, 'tis I Who have better grounds to do so, Fighting two:âsince she came forth Not for mine, but thine assistance; Though 'twas needless, since I know Knighthood's law too well: for seeing That thy fall was accidental, I myself had let thee rise. ALVARO. Then a double obligation Do I owe unto this lady, Since she came to give me life Ere I had been forced to take it From thy hands: because to thee I am not for this indebted:â Now I feel my anger ripen To resume the fight once more. MENDOZA. Don Alvaro, who detains thee? [They fight. ISABEL, aside. Oh! for power to call for aid! [A loud knocking is heard at the door. ALVARO. At the door there is a knocking.â MENDOZA. What's to be done? ALVARO. Let either die, And the survivor then may open. MENDOZA. You say well. Enter DOÃA ISABEL and INES. ISABEL. I first shall open Wide the door, and let them in. ALVARO. Do not so:â MENDOZA. You must not open! [DOÃA ISABEL opens the door and wishes to escape, but is detained by the CORREGIDOR, who enters with DON FERNANDO VALOR. ISABEL. Cavaliers, most opportunely Have you come: these two here standing Seek to kill each other. CORREGIDOR. Stay:â Since to find things in this mannerâ They contendingâyou being presentâ Says the matter, very clearly, That you are the cause. ISABEL, aside. Ah, me! Since I planned mine own destruction, When I thought to set me free. ALVARO. That the slightest inconvenience May not happen to a lady Unto whom I owe my life, I the simple truth will tell you:â For the cause that so hath moved me To this duel, is not love. No, but being the relation Of Don Juan Malecâthus I for him sought satisfaction. MENDOZA. It is true: it chanced this lady Came to see me the same time. CORREGIDOR. Since we trust the disagreements By the means we have concerted Will be ended, let all cease; It is best that this be settled Without blood, since he doth conquer Best who conquers without blood:â Go, in God's name, fair SeÃ±oras. ISABEL, aside. 'Tis my fortune's only gain. [Exeunt ISABEL and INES. VALOR. SeÃ±or Don Juan de Mendoza, To your kindred, it appeareth, And to ours, that this occurrence Should be settled within doors, (As the Castilian proverb has it)â And cemented by new ties, Since by giving DoÃ±a Clara,â She the phenix of Granada, Your betrothÃ©d hand, as part Of the.... MENDOZA. Cease this bootless language, SeÃ±or Fernando de Valor, For it doth the affair embarrass: If DoÃ±a Clara is a phenix, She may be so in Arabia, But in the mountains of Castile A phenix is by no means needed. And my kindred well should know Men like me ne'er form connections To secure a stranger's honour; Neither do I know 'twere fitting The Mendozas mixed their blood With the blood of Malec; never Can they blend in happy union The Mendozas and Malecas. VALOR. Don Juan Malec is a man.... MENDOZA. Like you:â VALOR. Like me, a proud descendant Of the monarchs of Granadaâ Since ascending to his fathers, You will find them kings like mine. MENDOZA. Mine, indeed, without being monarchs, Were still more than Moorish kings, Being unconquered mountaineers. After the battle of Guadalete, which completed the conquest of Spain by the Moors, the chivalry of Spain withdrew to the fastnesses of the Asturias, and under the guidance of Pelayo commenced immediately the work of deliverance. We can understand, therefore, says M. Damas Hinard, what pride a similar origin could awaken in the breast of Mendoza. ALVARO. What his lordship Don Fernando Has expressed upon this matterâ I shall hold upon the field. CORREGIDOR. Here my magisterial duty Ceases, and I take instead The cavalier's, which suits me better;â I, a Zuniga in Castile, Ere a justice in Granada. And so laying down this staff,â When and where you please, thou'lt find me Standing at Don Juan's side. Enter a SERVANT. SERVANT. Visitors the house have entered. CORREGIDOR. Let us all dissemble now; I resume my civil duties:â Here, Don Juan, still remain In confinement. MENDOZA. I, in all things Will obey you. CORREGIDOR, to ALVARO and VALOR. You retire. MENDOZA. And if further satisfaction You require.... CORREGIDOR. Acquaint Don Juan And myself when you have chosen.... MENDOZA. You will find us with the sword.... CORREGIDOR. And by the cloak alone protected. [Exeunt the CORREGIDOR and MENDOZA. VALOR, aside. This, my honour can consent to! ALVARO, aside. This, my valour can endure! VALOR. Is it for becoming Christian That I must receive this wrong? ALVARO. For embracing their religion, Is it, I am treated thus? VALOR. As God liveth, it is craven Not to seek for instant vengeance! ALVARO. As Heaven lives, 'tis infamous That I wait yet to avenge me! VALOR. Heaven but give me the occasion.... ALVARO. Give me but the occasion, Fortune.... VALOR. If the Destinies assist me.... ALVARO. If the Fates in pity grant it.... VALOR. I will act, that very quickly.... ALVARO. Spain will weep a thousand times.... VALOR. The strong valour.... ALVARO. The bold daring Of this arm so strong and powerful.... VALOR. Of the haughty-souled Valores. ALVARO. Of the valiant TuzanÃ­s. VALOR. Have you heard me? ALVARO. Yes, and echoed. VALOR. Let us end the tongue's weak language, And with hands begin to speak! ALVARO. Who opposes such beginning? [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Three years are supposed to elapse between the first and second acts. SCENE I. âTHE CAMP OF DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA, AT THE FOOT OF THE ALPUJARRA MOUNTAINS. A flourish of trumpetsâEnter DON JOHN of Austria and DON JUAN DE MENDOZA, preceded by a numerous retinue of soldiers. DON JOHN. O rebel mountain! O disloyal sight, Whose savage wildness, whose stupendous height, Whose towering structure, whose untamed estate, Pressing with unimaginable weight Upon the crushed earth liesâ Contracts the air and limits even the skiesâ Infamous haunt of thieves, Whose pregnant womb with embryo lightnings heaves, Here to be born and nursed But soon o'er Africa with thunderous rage to burst, This is the day, this is the fated day, On which thou must for thy dark treason pay, Because to-day in me are blent At once my vengeance and thy punishment, So blent, indeed, that jealous Fame withdraws, Nor crowns this triumph but with slight applause; As if the heavens would say That this is not to conquer, but to slay:â Since neither glory, nor the laurel leaves My valour can demand, Because I humble a vile herd of thieves, And subjugate a robber band:â This therefore makes me from the future claim More an avenger than a conqueror's nameâ But I would know from what a spark this clear Flame of revolt burst forth so fierce. MENDOZA. Then hear: This, heroic Austrian eagle, Is the mighty Alpujarra,â Is the natural rustic rampartâ Is the barbarous protection Of the Moors, who there attempt (Ill prepared for such achievement), Like Pelayo's mountain forces, To reconquer Spain once more:â It is difficult from its heightâ Intricate from its craggy wildnessâ Impregnable from its situationâ And invincible from its strength:â Fourteen leagues it stretches lengthways, But including all the distance In its circuit, more than fifty:â For between its opposite points There are vales that beautify itâ Fruitful fields that fertilize itâ Flowery gardens that delight it:â All its breast is peopled over Thick with villages and hamlets, Which at evening, when the sunset Sheds a glimmering twilight round, Seem like giant cliffs arising From the midst of concave rocks, Which in falling from its summits Hung suspended on its slopes:â Of all these, the greatest are Gabia, Berja, and Galera, Chosen arsenals of the three Chieftains, who the others govern; It containeth thirty thousand Moorish soldiers, without counting Or the women, or the children:â And upon this fertile pasture Flocks and herds unnumbered feed, Though their own support arises More from simple fruits than flesh-meatsâ Wild fruits from the tree, or dried onesâ Or the plants they cultivate. Since, not only from the furrows, But from the rocks themselves, a tribute Of the green herb do they draw; For so skilled in agriculture, And so studious of its secrets Are they, that their spades impregnate Even the rocks, and make them yield. As to the cause of the rebellion, Since in that I took a part, I beseech you, that in silence You permit my tongue to rest; Though 'tis better to acknowledge That I was myself the cause, Than to say, it was occasioned By severe and cruel edicts That were made for their repression: Better I should bear the blame Than a higher name be censured; But whatever the occasion, Whether the offence I gaveâ As I've said, my lord, or whether It was that ValÃ³r, the day Following that on which we quarrelled, Was, on entering the council, Questioned by the alguazil, And a dagger that he carried Hid beneath his cloak, drawn forth,â Or, the penalties they suffered Growing more and more severe From the ordinances issued By the court from day to day, Drove them so to desperation, That they planned this insurrection,â So it was: for they retired With their arms, supplies, and money, And the three years, that this treason Hath continued, it hath been Kept inviolate by this people; Which is surely wonderful, That among those thirty thousand Men assembled for this purpose, Not one traitor could be found Base enough to tell the secrets Which those many days conceal. With what ignorance, what error Did he speak, who said a secret Was in danger when three knew it? When there's none with thirty thousand Interested to preserve it:â The first thunderbolt that issued From this lightningâforged amid These Etnean cliffs and cavernsâ Were bold thefts, were bloody murdersâ Robberies of many churchesâ Insults, sacrileges, treasons,â So that soon, Granada, bathed In its blood, complained to Heaven That it was the sad arena Of dark tragedies and woes. Quickly was a cure attempted By the civil power, but soon Seeing how 'twas scorned and outraged, All united for defence: Then the sword replaced the white wand, Then respect gave way to force, And in civil war was ended What resistance but began. The corregidor was murdered, And the city, now awakened To the danger, called to arms All the force of the militia:â This did not suffice, since always (Such success hath novelty) Fortune smiled upon their banners; So that all of war's mischances Frowned malignly upon ours; Ah! how heavy! how oppressive Are those favours, since from them Never have they turned averted! Apprehension grew on our sideâ Pride and daring grew on theirs,â Till from all sides dangers threaten. As 'tis known that they are waiting Aid from Africaâ'tis plain That when hither comes this succour, In the stopping of its entrance We our forces must divide;â More than this, it must be thought of, How the slightest accident In a moment, may the other Moors of Spain unite with them; Since all those of Estremadura, Of Valencia and Castile, Wait but tidings of some triumph Ere they openly pronounce; But that you may know this people Better, that they're wise as brave, Nor without political science, Hear from me how they are ruled:â Which from time to time was told us By some spies, on whom we seized; The first act on which they treated Was the choosing of a chief, And as in this proud election There was rivalry between Don Fernando and another Man of equal noble birth, Don Alvaro TuzanÃ­, Thus proposed Don Juan Malec, That the former should be king, And that he should wed the lovely Isabella TuzanÃ­, Sister to Alvaro:âoh! [Aside. How it pains me! how it galls me! To recall to mind the name Of this TuzanÃ­, thus honoured Next in place unto their king, Since for queen they chose his sister:â When ValÃ³r was crowned, the first Of his acts was the opposing Every way the royal edicts,â That his subjects might the sooner Reassume their nation's ritesâ It was ordered that no Christian Name be used, nor even the worship Of the Christian faith allowed:â And to give himself the example, He at once assumed the ancient Name of AbenhumÃ©ya, From the kings of CÃ³rdova Whose pure blood he doth inherit. He commanded too, that no one Should in conversation use Aught but the Arabic language, Nor be seen in any dress But the Moorishânor acknowledge Any but Mahomet's sect:â After these, his next endeavour Was, to re-divide his forces; And Galera, that proud city Yonder, which first meets your eyeâ Whose high walls and deep-sunk trenches Nature fashioned with such skill, That it never can be conquered But with great expense of blood, He has given in charge to Malecâ Malec, who is Clara's fatherâ Clara, now Maleca called:â TuzanÃ­ received Gabia Named the Proud, while he in Berga Holds his courtâthe heart that quickens All this giant mass of stone:â Thus, as far as we are able To discover, are they placed. This, then, is the Alpujarra, Whose stupendous summits seem As if they would hurl them headlong Down to kneel before thy feet. DON JOHN. Your monitions are, Don Juan, Worthy a Mendoza, as Of thyself:âthou'rt doubly loyalâ But what drums are those I hear? [A sound of drums is heard, and various bodies of troops are seen passing. MENDOZA. Soldiers, that on their arrival Seek the muster-roll, my lord. DON JOHN. Whence this troop? MENDOZA. 'Tis from Granada And the neighbouring country, which The Henil waters. DON JOHN. Who commands it? MENDOZA. The Marquis de MondÃ©jar, who Is the count too of Tendilla:â Of the Alhambra, and the country Round about, perpetual warden. DON JOHN. The Moor in Africa doth tremble, When he but hears his name. What's this? [Drums. MENDOZA. 'Tis a band of troops from Murcia. DON JOHN. Who has got the command of those? MENDOZA. The great Marquis de los Belez. DON JOHN. Let his fame and his achievements Be his name's bright coronal. [Drums. MENDOZA. This detachment is from Baeza, And it has for its commander A brave soldier, one to whom Fame is owing many a statue As eternal as his glory:â My lord, 'tis Sancho de Avila. DON JOHN. For the praise that he deserveth, 'Tis but little to declare, Simply that he is the pupil Of the Duke of Alva, who Taught him in his school to conquer, But never how to be subdued. [Drums. MENDOZA. The foot-soldiers now advancing Are the veteran troops of Flanders, Which descended for this exploit, To the Henil from the Meuseâ Pearls with pearls thus interchanging. DON JOHN. Who doth come with it? MENDOZA. A wonder Of nobility and valour, Don Lope de Figueroa. DON JOHN. Many stories have been told me Of his courage and his patience, One so great and one so small. MENDOZA. Being by the gout impeded, He impatiently endures Giving such inactive service To your highness in the war. DON JOHN. Truly I desire to know him. Enter DON LOPE DE FIGUEROA. LOPE. Then I vow to God, your highness Has not one minutest atom Of advantage over me; Since 'tis but to see me sometime Strive to kneel thus at thy feet, That these legs I have put up with. DON JOHN. How do you feel yourself? LOPE. As one Who to serve you, comes from Flanders Here, my lord, to Andalusia; And it is no needless duty, Since if you won't go to Flanders, Flanders then must come to you. DON JOHN. May Heaven grant me yet this favour!â Do you lead brave troops? LOPE. So brave That were this wild Alpujarra Hell itself, and were Mahomet Its commander-in-chief in person, They, my lord, would enter in;â Those excepted, who are gouty, Who could climb not up the cliffs:â For they come...... [A voice within. Retire! detain thee!â GARCES, within. Pass I must! so stand aside. Enter GARCES, with ALCUZCUZ on his shoulders. DON JOHN. What is this? GARCES. My rounds pursuing On the slope of this Sierra, I, methought, amid some branches Heard a noise, and looking there, I this dog discovered lurking As in ambuscade amongst them, Plainly with a spy's intent:â With my musket-strap I tied him, And that he might bark some tidings, I have brought him on my shoulders. LOPE. A good soldier! as God liveth!â Are there more of them like this? GARCES. Does your lordship then imagine It is only out of Flanders That good soldiers come? ALCUZCUZ, aside. The matter, Alcuzcuz, looks rather serious, And already Adam's apple Seems to tighten in your throat. DON JOHN, to GARCES. Now that I remember, soldier, Who you are, a valiant exploit Like to this, appears not new. GARCES. Oh! at what a little cost Princes can reward brave actions! By a word of praise 'tis done! DON JOHN. Approach. ALCUZCUZ. To me do you say it? DON JOHN. Yes. ALCUZCUZ. The honour is too great To approach you any nearer:â I am better here. DON JOHN. Your name? ALCUZCUZ, aside. Here a little caution's needful:â Alcuzcuz, a poor Morisco, [Aloud. Who by force was carried here To this cursed Alpujarraâ Being a Christian in my heartâ Knowing all about the Credo, The Trinity and the Daily Breadâ The Salve Regina, and the other Fourteen Commandments of the Church: 'Twas for saying to my comrades That I would a Christian be, That they wanted all to kill me, So I fled, or ran, or flew, Till I met with him who took me, When I yielded myself up: If you spare my life, I'll tell you All the plans they're plotting yonder, And will show you how to enter By the mountain unperceived. DON JOHN. Though I think that he is lying, It is possible that he Tells a little truth. MENDOZA. Who questions But some Christians still are there? I myself have known a lady Who was carried there by force. DON JOHN. Let us neither be too trusting, Nor too doubting; Garces, thou Take the charge of thine own captive. GARCES. Yes, be sure, I'll guard him well. DON JOHN. We shall soon see if the story Which he tells is true or false. Let us take a turn, Don Lope, Through the quarters of our troops, And consult upon the best way To begin the attack. MENDOZA. Your highness Sees what's right, for though this war Seems indeed of trifling moment, It is most important, since There are matters like the present, Which when gained confer no honour, But when lost inflict disgrace; And it therefore doth behove us To attend to things like theseâ Not so much to gain new laurels, But to lose not what we have. [Exeunt all but GARCES and ALCUZCUZ. GARCES. Well, friend, what shall I call you? ALCUZCUZ. Rice; Since my name among the Moriscos Was plain Alcuzcuz, among Christians it is Rice; 'tis proper, Since I change my Moorish pottage, I should get a Christian name. GARCES. Alcuzcuz, you are my captive; Tell me truth. ALCUZCUZ. With all my heart. GARCES. You but now assured his highness John of Austria...... ALCUZCUZ. Was it he? GARCES. That you could point out a passage To this proud Sierra's heart. ALCUZCUZ. Yes, my master. GARCES. Though 'tis certain That he cometh to subdue it, With the Marquis de los Belezâ With the Marquis de MondÃ©jar, With Don Lope de Figueroa, And Don Sancho de Avila, I am anxious that the entrance To these mountains he should owe Solely unto my exertions. Guide me thither, I'm impatient To examine and explain it. ALCUZCUZ, aside. I must someway trick this Christian, And by giving him the slip, Gain the Alpujarra:âcome then On with me. GARCES. Just wait a little, For within this guardhouse here, I deposited my rations When I went on guard this morning, And I'm anxious to regain them; In my saddle-bags I'll bring them (That no needless time be wasted), Thus we may upon our journey Eat and walk at once. ALCUZCUZ. So be it. GARCES. Let us go. ALCUZCUZ, aside. O saint Mahomet, Thou wilt be my only prophet, Guide me, and I'll go to Mecca. Ah! that's nothing to a man Who is always pilgrimizing. [Exeunt. SCENE II. âA BEAUTIFUL MOUNTAIN DISTRICT. ON THE SIDE OF A GENTLE HILL ARE SEATED DON FERNANDO VALOR (ABENHUMEYA) AND DONNA ISABELLA TUZANÃ (LIDORA). A CROWD OF MOORS AND MUSICIANS ARE SEEN AT A LITTLE DISTANCE. ABENHUMEYA. Here amid these fragrant bowers, Twined of thyme and mountain heather, Where the Spring has called together The rich Cortez of her flowersâ Where the ground is overstrown With emerald leaves and buds of gold, And our ravished eyes behold The queenly Rose ascend her throneâ Here, Lidora, thou canst restâ My beauteous spouseâa tranquil hour, While, perchance, sweet music's power May charm the sadness from your breast. LIDORA. Ah! my valiant lord, no narrow Fame for thee is Fate bestowing, Not alone for thee are growing Victor oaks in Alpujarra; The laurel, too, shall bloom for theeâ The sacred tree that loves the plainâ When the wail of conquered Spain Shall proclaim thy victory. No, my lord; 'tis not disdain Of your grandeur, your affection Makes me feel the deep dejection Weighing on my heart and brain; 'Tis the price at which we buy Joy's divine but fleeting treasureâ Never comes the light of pleasure But the shade of grief is nigh: This alone, my lord, believe me, Is my secret cause of anguishâ 'Tis for this alone I languish;â (Ah! that I could so deceive me!) [Aside. Thus changeful Fate with power malign Wounds and heals my doubting breastâ I must be sad for being blestâ And must be blest for being thine. ABENHUMEYA. If such a cause as this control thee, And thou art sad from too much gladness, I must feel the joyful sadness That I never can console thee. Never can this grief decay, Ne'er can cease this sweet dejection, Since your power and my affection Must be greater every day. But sing, sing, in notes of gladness, Sing the beauty of my bride,â Ever have been close allied Music and such happy sadness. [The musicians sing. âThere is little need to say Whose thou art, sweet joy divine, Since 'tis plain thou must be mine By the shortness of thy stay.â [MALEC enters and advances to speak to ABENHUMEYA. TUZANÃ (DON ALVARO) and MALECA (DONNA CLARA) appear in the Moorish costume at opposite sides of the stage, and remain there without advancing. MALECA. âThere is little need to say Whose thou art, sweet joy divineâ [Aside. TUZANÃ. âSince 'tis plain thou must be mine By the shortness of thy stay.â [The instruments continue to play during the remainder of this scene. MALECA. What a strange and mournful feeling Has this song awakened now! TUZANÃ. At this voice, I know not how, Terror through my breast is stealing! MALECA. When to treat about my marriage, Hither came my lord and father. TUZANÃ. When I hoped Love's fruits to gather, After many a sore miscarriage. MALECA. Ah! my joyâthe sweet notes sayâ TUZANÃ. Ah! my hope, this fate is thineâ [Both sing with the musicians. Yes 'tis plain thou must be mine By the shortness of thy stay. MALEC. Since, my lord, the light of Love Shineth through the smoke of Marsâ As the light of evening stars Through the passing clouds aboveâ I have come to tell to thee, That to-day I wed my daughter. ABENHUMEYA. Of the many that have sought her, Who is then the favoured he? MALEC. TuzanÃ­, Lidora's brother. ABENHUMEYA. Ah! thou hast selected duly, Since I know how long and truly They have been faithful to each other. For them Love shines not dark or dim, Nor yet a doubtful fate doth giveâ He without her can never live, And she must perish without him. Where are they both? [TUZANÃ and MALECA approach. MALECA. Behold me here, Glad at thy feet. TUZANÃ. And I am thus Proud, that you stretch your hand to us. ABENHUMEYA. Come, let my arms embrace ye near; And since the sacred Alcoran (Beneath whose law we all unite) Prescribes alone this marriage rite, That to the woman, by the man, Some bridal gifts presented be, Thus, TuzanÃ­, some gifts of thine Give to Maleca, the divine. TUZANÃ. Ah! they are all too poor for thee, For thou art such a peerless oneâ Brightest of all that brightest beâ That to give diamonds unto thee Is to give light unto the sun. Here is a Cupid all complete, Arm'd with his bow and arrows keen, And yet the conquered god is seen To kneel submissive at thy feet. Here is a string of pearls, to twine Around thy beauteous neck of snowâ Tears of the Dawn, which yet must flow To find her face outshone by thine. Here is an eagle fair to see, Of emerald greenâHope's favourite hueâ That bird alone that dares to view Th'unclouded sun, will gaze on thee. This ruby chain perchance thou'lt wear Amid thy tresses dark and smoothâ I need it not; my chains, in sooth, Are thy sweet smiles and curling hair. And these memorials mayâbut no, I cannot ask so cold a lotâ If thy own heart recall me not To these, that bliss I would not owe. MALECA. TuzanÃ­, these gifts I take, And, grateful for thy love, I vow To prize them all my life, as now, And keep and wear them for thy sake. LIDORA. And I congratulate you both Upon the happy vows you've plighted. MALEC. Come, let their hands be now unitedâ The sweet reward of hearts not loth. TUZANÃ. Ah! dearest, at thy feet I lieâ MALECA. Nay, let my arms henceforward be A lasting chain for love and thee. TUZANÃ. And I am blest! MALECA. And so am I! [At the moment their hands meet, a sound of drums is heard. MALEC. No Moorish tabours give the sound, The startling sound that hither comes. No! 'tis the sound of Spanish drums That thunders through the mountains round. TUZANÃ. Alas! this sound forebodeth woe. ABENHUMEYA. Stop then the bridal, till we see What this new circumstance may be. TUZANÃ. My lord, and hast thou yet to know That there can be nothing newer, Nothing stranger now than this, That my heart can feel a bliss Ever fated to endure? Scarcely on my heart and lips Hope's bright sun outbeams again, When the dusky arms of Spain Hide its light in dark eclipse! Enter ALCUZCUZ with the saddle-bags on his shoulder. ALCUZCUZ. Thanks to Allah! and Mahomet! At your feet again I'm seen. TUZANÃ. Alcuzcuz, where have you been? ALCUZCUZ. Oh! I ran like any comet. ABENHUMEYA. What has happened to you? ALCUZCUZ. Being On my post to-day, post-haste I was seized behind my waist By a man, without my seeing; With two others then I trod On, until at last they brought me To Don John, who a Christian thought me, Because I said I believed in God; So they doomed me not to die, But with a soldier to remain, Who does not wash himself in vain. Scarcely had he learned that I Knew a pass that lay amid The Alpujarra hills, when he Wished at once the place to see; From his comrades he lay hid, And giving me his saddle-bags, In which his daily rations lay, We in secret took our way Between the mountain's winding crags; But when we reached the lonely wood I fled along a mountain hollow, And he, not wishing there to follow, Lost both his prisoner and his food; For when he ventured to pursue, A Moorish trumpet that hard by Rang out, persuaded him to fly: So I bring this news to you.â The foe, that mighty son of Mars Don John of Industry Throughout the play, the language of Alcuzcuz in the original is composed of total gibberish, or broken Spanish. In the above instance, he mispronounces the names of the leaders of the Christian army, Don John of Austria, the Marquis de Mondejar, the Marquis de Belez, Don Lope de Figueroa, and Don Sancho de Avila, in the way I have endeavoured to imitate. doth lead, And, 'tis said, accompanied By the great Marquis of Mondayjars, And also the Marquis of Bellies, and He who brings the Flemish diploma, Don LopÃ© de Figure de Roma, And Sancho the Devil, the last of the band, Who to-day to the Alpojarro Come to attack you. ABENHUMEYA. Cease! no more! They shall find ere the day is o'er My wrath can fly like a winged arrow. LIDORA. And lo! on yonder mountain height, From which the sun's last rays are fled, Fearing to stain its vesper red, Fearing to waste its golden light, I see a mighty myriad band, Whose arms and flags the sight confuseâ Replacing evening's absent huesâ Treading our sacred mountain land. MALECA. A mighty host we plainly see Granada leads this deed to do. ABENHUMEYA. Many worlds were all too few, If they mean to conquer me:â Though the hero who doth plan it, And treads our labyrinths one by one, Instead of the fifth Charles' son, Were the son of the fifth planet. For though their valour now presumes To gild th'horizon with strange fires, Those rocks shall be their funeral pyresâ These mountains soon their awful tombs. And since at length draws nigh the hour We long have sought forâlet us stand Ready prepared, with sword in hand, Impatient for his approaching power; And so my friends, as we are three, Let us divide and wait the foe, You, Malec, to Galera go; You to GabÃ­a, TuzanÃ­; And I in erja shall remain. He who on whom the attack shall fall, By Allah's willâon Allah call, Nor shall the call be made in vainâ Go to GabÃ­a, and the fÃªte Which glory from thy love hath ta'en,â We, when the victory we gain, With greater joy shall celebrate:â [Exeunt all but TUZANÃ, MALECA, ALCUZCUZ, and BEATRICE. MALECA. âAh, there's little need to say Whose thou art, sweet joy divine!â TUZANÃ. âSince 'tis plain thou must be mine By the shortness of thy stay!â MALECA. Joys, alas! too early doomed, Dying ere their birth was known. TUZANÃ. Roses plucked ere they were blown, Sweet flowers withered ere they bloomed. MALECA. So enfeebled, so prostrated, That a breath has laid thee low. TUZANÃ. What thou art my heart doth know, Vain my lips aloud should state it. MALECA. 'Tis when thou dost fly away That my longing heart pursues thee:â TUZANÃ. Since I am about to lose thee, Whose thou art thou need'st not say. MALECA. Joy of some fond heart forlorn, Too soon thou left that aching sideâ Abortive birth that thus hath died Even in the moment it was born;â If through accident or scorn My breast thy fickle wing decoys, To him whose peace thy flight destroys Return with fluttering pinions faster, Leave me, and re-seek thy master, Delusive dream,âsweet joy of joys! TUZANÃ. Scarcely did I thee possess Rapture, when upon thee fell Death, it were no miracle Were thy short life even less: I was wild with happiness, Now with melancholy pineâ Ah! how fair doth rapture shine, Seeking thus another's breast, Pain!âhow deep thy sting is press'd On my heart, because thou'rt mine! MALECA. Joy, although a dream to me, Still thy shade is worth possessing. TUZANÃ. Since thou twice canst give a blessing, And but once a misery. MALECA. Twice from this day thou wilt be A rapture-giver:â THE TWO. When thou curest Griefs that only thou canst banish, But thy other power is surest.... TUZANÃ. In the speed with which you vanish.... MALECA. In the little thou endurest:â TUZANÃ. Thus in long soliloquy, Dear Maleca, have I spoken, Since my trembling accents broken Had no power to speak to thee, Since my heart was doomed to see Hope's victorious palm that hung Budding o'er itâthus outflung Withering ere it bore one leaf,â And so was silent:âthe heart's grief Can not be spoken with the tongue. MALECA. Still to speak is a free action, For the tongue may silence keepâ But to hear is not so cheapâ And is proof to all attraction: Since so great is my distraction, That the functions of the ear Seem to fail and disappear; Call not grief like this, then, weak, Since you have not power to speak, Nor have I the power to hear. TUZANÃ. The king to GabÃ­a sendeth me, Thou to Galera must remove, My honour, struggling with my love, Scarcely can act its tyranny; Let it awhile thy dwelling be My darling wife, Maleca mine, And may the pitying heavens incline The minds of those whom we awaitâ To try their power upon the gate Of proud GabÃ­a, since 'tis mineâ Not of Galera, since 'tis thine:â MALECA. Can I not see thee then, or know Aught of thy welfare, till this feud Granada shall at length conclude? TUZANÃ. Ah! yes thou must, for I shall go From one to the other, to and fro, Each wished-for nightâtwo leagues shall not Prevent my visiting the spot Where my heart's wishes fly before. MALECA. I know that love's strong wings can soar Even with the speed and height of thought; I, to the postern shall repair, And wait thee 'neath the wall's protection. TUZANÃ. And I, secure in thy affection, Shall every night rejoin thee there. Now one embrace by which to swear. [Sound of drums. MALECA. The drums announce the squadrons move. TUZANÃ. Alas! the time:â MALECA. What pangs I prove! TUZANÃ. Oh! how I suffer! MALECA. How I sigh! TUZANÃ. Is this to love? MALECA. It is to die! TUZANÃ. Is it then more to die than love? [They go out, leaving ALCUZCUZ and ZARA (BEATRICE) behind them. ZARA. Alcuzcuz, come hither, for we Can now converse without molestation. ALCUZCUZ. Little Zara, this invitation, Is it to the saddle-bags or me? ZARA. Still wilt thou be the gayest of wags, Laughing when all around thee are crying? Listen to me:â ALCUZCUZ. You are not replying If this is to me or the saddle-bags. ZARA. It is to you; but since I see You doubt of my loveâa shame and a sinâ I wish to see what they carry within. ALCUZCUZ. Then it was to the bags, and not to me:â ZARA, examining. This is porkâyou're damned in a minute, For carrying such an unholy loadâ This is wine too, securely stowed,â Bless me! there's nothing but poison in it, Which I do not desire to touch, Nor even to see. Take care of thy breath, Alcuzcuz, for this will be death, If they are able to prove as much:â ALCUZCUZ. Why there seemeth more than a foison Of venom here, and we must believe it, Since Zara says so, we must receive it As such, since she is so skilled in poison; And the best proof that these are not eatables Is that Zara had power to resist themâ A tooth like Zara's would never have missed them, Skilled and knowing as she is in sweetables,â That Christian scoundrel doubtless intended To kill, not keep me with him in slavery: Well! was there ever such scurvy knavery? But MahÃ³met my cause befriendedâ All because I promised to wander As far as Mecca, to see the bones Of his blessÃ©d shins:âBut hark, the tones Of the drums peal out from the battle yonder,â [Drums are heard. The mountain is full of troops: in haste I must at once to my master repair:â I wonder is there any one there [To the audience. Who would object this poison to taste. SCENE III. âTHE CHRISTIAN CAMP. Enter DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA, DON LOPE DE FIGUEROA, DON JUAN DE MENDOZA, marching at the head of their soldiers. MENDOZA. From this spot we best can see The disposition of each fortressâ Now that the sun declining westward Hangs like a jewel from the sky, This town which on the right hand rises Built on an ever-firm foundation Of solid rock, which has for ages Seemed on the point of falling downâ Is GabÃ­a the proud, and that Which stands as proudly on the left hand, Whose towers and rocks of rival whiteness Ever compete in hue and form,â That is Berja:âGalera thisâ Which is another name for galleyâ Given to it because of its siteâ As rocks rise round it, like stony billowsâ And flowers beneath it like flowing wavesâ And the winds whistling over, make it Seem to move amid waves and winds. DON JOHN. One of these fortresses must be chosen First to besiege. LOPE. Then let us see Which of them holds the best position Suitable to our present designâ Then let us put our hands to the labourâ Since, thank God, it requires not feet. DON JOHN. Bring me hither that Moorish prisoner, And let us learn at once if he Spoke or not the truth in this matter That he lately mentioned to us;â Where is Garces, into whose custody I this prisoner wholly gave? MENDOZA. I have not seen him from that moment. GARCES, within. Ah! woe is me. DON JOHN. See who is this. Enter GARCES, hurriedly and wounded. GARCES. 'Tis I, who at the feet of your highness Come to throw myself half-dead. MENDOZA. 'Tis Garces. DON JOHN. Tell me what hath happened. GARCES. Deign your highness to pardon an error For my important tidings. DON JOHN. Speak.â GARCES. That Morisco lately taken, Given to me to guard, informed you, That he came with the intention To betray the Alpujarra; I, my lord, desiring strongly To survey the pass, and be He who first would enter in it, (Honour having an ambition Higher than the hope of profit)â Bade him point me out the way;â Him I followed by the lonely Labyrinths of the mountain-gorges, Where the sun each day it rises Is within deep caverns lostâ Scarcely had we reached two craggy Hillocks o'er a deep ravine, When he flew with sudden swiftness Up the rocks, and shouting then, Was, as if to cheat even echo, Answered by a troop of Moors, Who descending with the fury Even of what they are, of dogs, Rushed upon the prey he brought them. Useless now was opposition, So with trickling blood down streaming From my wounds, I turned and fled, Seeking shelter from the foliage Of a neighbouring wood, and there Saw beneath the deep foundation Of Galera's walls, an open Yawning melancholy cave, In the rock on which 'tis founded, Which beneath the weight is doubtless Forced to gape, and which for ever Vainly seeks it jaws to closeâ Giving me an easy entrance. There I lay concealed, and there, Whether that they did not see me, Or that buried there they thought me, There they left me as one dead; In this manner I was able All the place to reconnoitre, And find out that this Galera Has been undermined by time, Which for rock-supported structures Is the ablest engineer; And that you with little trouble May ignite and blow it up, By this mouth an entrance gaining To the town, without the tedious Process of a siege: I offer For one life the lives of all That are found within Galera, For my anger cannot promiseâ For my sword cannot bestow Either pity to the childrenâ Either on the old men mercy, Or respect unto the women,â More than this I cannot do. DON JOHN. Let this soldier be removed: [He is led out. I consider a good omen, Don LopÃ© de Figueroa This to learn about Galera; For I longed from the first moment That I heard the Alpujarra Held a town they called Galera, (Or a galley) to blockade itâ To find out, as on the ocean, If I had the same good fortune With the galleys of the land. LOPE. Why delay then? let us forward, Seizing on the outer postsâ Better hour than this, we never Could have hoped: for in the night-time We can reach it unperceived;â On! my squadron, to Galera! A SOLDIER. Pass the order. ANOTHER SOLDIER. Pass it on. ALL. To Galera. DON JOHN. Grant me, Heavens, On the land the same good fortune That you gave me on the sea, That opposed to one anotherâ That great naval fight, and this Land engagement that impendeth, It may be of me declared, That by sea and land, one epoch Had two victories so alike That myself could not distinguish 'Twixt the earthly and the navalâ Which the siege and which the sea-fight. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. âOUTSIDE THE GATES OF GALERA. Enter TUZANÃ and ALCUZCUZ. TUZANÃ. Life and honour, Alcuzcuz, Do I leave unto thy keeping, Since you know, if they discover, I GabÃ­a left, and ventured To Galera, life and honour In one instant must I lose; With my mare be sure await me Here, while I this garden enter: For we have without delaying, To return into GabÃ­a, Ere our absence there is known. ALCUZCUZ. Ever I am glad to serve you, Though I came in such a hurry That you did not give me time To deposit in my chamber Even the saddle-bagsâdepend on't I shall watch here without budging. TUZANÃ. If you leave this, by yon heaven! With your life you'll pay the forfeit:â Enter MALECA from a door. MALECA. Is it thou? TUZANÃ. Who else would ever Be so faithful? MALECA. Enter quickly, That they may not recognise thee Talking with me from the walls. [Exeunt. ALCUZCUZ. Well, by Allah! I am sorry, SeÃ±or Sleep, I can't go with you:â Well, there is not a worse office In the world than that of pander, For in every other business We are working for ourselves, But in pandering, for others:â Ho! there, Bess!âI feel so drowsy, I must shake it off by keeping To my story. Oft the cobbler Makes himself new shoesâthe tailor Makes himself at times a coat,â Likewise doth the cook examine If the fricassee be good, And the pastry-cook can sometimes Eat the pie that he has made,â But the obliging pander only Cannot turn his toil to profit, Neither wears the shoe he cobbles, Nor doth taste the pie he bakes,â Ho! there, mare; good heavens! she's off, Though she knows I must pursue her:â Ho! mare, stay, and do for me But this favour that I ask you, And I'll do for you as much Any time that you ask me:â Ah! 'tis useless now to follow; Alcuzcuz, a pretty business Have you made of this, my friend; How shall master now return hence? He will kill me, it is certain, Since he cannot reach GabÃ­a Now in time by any means. Just suppose he comes and tells you, Bring the mareâI have it notâ What do you mean? The mare has fled me. By what road? The hills there yonder. Then I will kill youâPish! a dagger Is the next moment through my heart! Since 'tis fated you must perish, Alcuzcuz, you had better choose your Mode of death. Let us die by poison, As that is easiestâthen so be it, Since I am weary now of life:â [He takes out a bottle from the bag, and drinks. It is better thus to perish, Than to die in an ugly manner Bathed and smeared all o'er with blood. How do you feel? Why never better,â Then the poison is rather weakâ If you mean to die in earnest, You must take a good deal more. [Drinks. He who takes poison is never chilly, But feels a fire in every vein; Then to burn all through my interior, More of the poison I must take, [Drinks. That I may die by little and little. Ah! it now begins to work, Now the effect becomes apparent, For my eyes are troubled and glazed, And my brain is like a tee-totum, And my tongue grows thick and flabby, And my mouth is like hot iron; But since I die, I should not leave A drop of the poison to kill another; [Drinks. 'Tis common charity. Where the devil Is my mouth, that I cannot find it. [Drums are heard. VOICES within. To arms! sentinels of Galera, To arms! ALCUZCUZ. Eh! what is this! But if my eyes see naught but lightnings, What wonder thunders thus I hear? Enter TUZANÃ and MALECA, alarmed. MALECA. My lord, the sentinels have kindled Their signal watch-fires on the walls. TUZANÃ. Doubtless the Christian camp is moving, Under the silent shade and cover Of the night, upon Galera. MALECA. Fly, my dearest lord, for now All the fort is in commotion. TUZANÃ. Will it be a glorious action To be told of me, that I Left my wife exposed.... MALECA. Oh! sorrow. TUZANÃ. And abandoned her in peril? MALECA. Yes, because it is Gabia That you must in honour guard, And perhaps they may besiege it First of all. 'Tis duty calls. TUZANÃ. Ah! who ever saw confusion Like to this? or in one moment Suffered so much pain? At once Love and honour call upon me. MALECA. Answer them but to your honour. TUZANÃ. Ere I answer, I am hopeful Yet to obey the two. MALECA. What way? TUZANÃ. By resolving now to take thee With me,âfor if I, in leaving Or in taking you, am lost, Love and honour both experience Equal fortune, equal risk,â Come with me, a steed is waitingâ Swift outrunner of the windâ It will bear us. MALECA. With my husband I may go, I hazard nothingâ I am thine. TUZANÃ. Ho! Alcuzcuz. ALCUZCUZ. Who is calling? TUZANÃ. I; get ready Quick the mare. ALCUZCUZ. The mare? TUZANÃ. Why wait thus? ALCUZCUZ. I am waiting for the mare; To return she gave a promise:â TUZANÃ. Where then is she? ALCUZCUZ. Gone off cleanly. But as she's a mare of honour, She I'm sure will soon be back. TUZANÃ. By the heavens above me, traitor! .... ALCUZCUZ. Do not touch me, keep aloof, For I tell you I am poisoned, And my very breath may kill you. TUZANÃ. I will give you now your death. MALECA. Hold, restrain thee! Ah! [She interposes and is wounded in the hand. TUZANÃ. What's this? MALECA. In my effort to detain thee, I my hand have slightly scarred. TUZANÃ. This dear blood a life must pay for. MALECA. Then because 'tis mine, I ask you Not to kill him. TUZANÃ. Your entreaty Would absolve a greater oath; Does it bleed much? MALECA. 'Tis a trifle. TUZANÃ. In this handkerchief enfold it. MALECA. Since you see Fate interposes To prevent my flightâdepartâ And as in one day Galera Scarce will yield, I freely offer To go with you on to-morrow; Since the secret pass lies open, We can leave at any time. TUZANÃ. With that hope alone I tear me From thy arms. MALECA. May Allah guard thee! TUZANÃ. To what end, if life is hateful Without thee? ALCUZCUZ. Oh! if you want A good remedy to lose itâ I have here a drop remaining Of the most delicious poison. MALECA. Go then. TUZANÃ. Ah! how sad I go! MALECA. How afflicted I remain! TUZANÃ. Feeling that some hostile planet...... MALECA. Feeling that some adverse fate...... TUZANÃ. Shines malignly on my passion...... MALECA. Comes between me and my love...... TUZANÃ. Ever riseth...... MALECA. Standeth ever...... TUZANÃ. Wakeful but for my misfortunes. MALECA. Ready with a Christian army Ever to disturb our joy. [Exeunt MALECA and TUZANÃ. ALCUZCUZ. Is this death? or is it slumber? Death and sleep are one they say, And they're right, for now I know not If I'm dead, or only sleep! [Lies down and the curtain falls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. âOUTSIDE THE WALLS OF GALERA.âTIME: NIGHT. Enter TUZANÃ alone. ALCUZCUZ seen sleeping at one side. TUZANÃ. O chilly night, so pale and starry-eyed, Into whose silent care my dearest hopes confide The glad result of an attempt like this,â My soul its triumph, and my love its blissâ Since though your stars are beautiful and bright, Maleca fair will give a nobler light, When in the clasp of my enfolding arms The dearest prize earth holds shall fly with all her charms; On wings of blended love and fear Have I with rapid flight across the land come here Unto Galeraâhere unto this part, Where Nature works, without the aid of art, Leafy labyrinths secure, Neither too plainly open, nor obscure, Which for my steed may be A nightly shelter; and as no eyes see, I may attach him to this trunk of a tree, Where, by his reins alone, shall he Be more secure, than when on yesternight I gave the charge to a man..... [He trips against ALCUZCUZ. How everything doth fright A loving breast! An augury Of some impending sad event Even my firm heart must feel this accident, Since the first moment that I quit my horse, My foot must strike against some wretched corse. All I have seen, all I have met to-day Fills me with terror, horror and dismay; O wretch, that here hast met thy doom! O thou that hast a mountain for thy tomb! The troubles of thy state are o'erâ While I must struggle with a thousand more! ALCUZCUZ, awaking. Who is that that's walking on me? TUZANÃ. Can I believe my sightâmy hearing? Who art thou?âspeak!â ALCUZCUZ. Why, Alcuzcuz, Whom you ordered to remain here With the mare, and so I have, Unobserved by anybody;â If you meant unto Gabia To go back, why stay so late? But I know that lovers always Are so tardy taking leave. TUZANÃ. Alcuzcuz, what brings you hither? ALCUZCUZ. Well! to ask me such a question!â Have I not been waiting for you Since the moment that you entered By the wall to see the lady? TUZANÃ. Who ere saw the like of this?â From last night, you mean to tell me You have waited here? ALCUZCUZ. Who's speaking Of last night? I've been a moment Dozing from narcotic poison Which I lately took from fear, As my master said he'd kill me For permitting his good mare To go gadding through these by-ways:â But the mare has now returned, And the poison is not deadly, Praise to Allah for the same!â Therefore let us go. TUZANÃ. What fooling! You were drunk the whole night through. ALCUZCUZ. Then it must have been on poison: Yes 'tis easy to believe it, For my mouth is like a furnace, And my lips and eyes are dry, And as hard as flintsâmy palate Like to tinderâyes, the potion Must have been allâvinegar. TUZANÃ. Leave me, for it were not well That again you should deprive me Of my joy, since through your fault I, last night, a great occasion Lost, and I would not repeat it Now this second night through thee. ALCUZCUZ. No, not mine, the fault was Zara's, Since she told me it was poison, And my only wish in drinking Was to be deadâ(drunk). [A noise is heard within. TUZANÃ. A crowd Comes this way; beneath these branches Let us hide until they pass. [They conceal themselves at the side. Enter a number of soldiers headed by GARCES. GARCES. This is the entrance of the mine Which beneath the walls extendeth; Forward, forward, but in silence, That we may be heard by none; When I apply the fire, some moments Let us wait, until the mountain Bursts asunder, and its ashes Rise like clouds amid the air; When the mine explodes, let no one Wait an instant, but advance And upon the exposed intrenchments Seize at once, and so maintain Till the arrival of the other Troops, who there in ambush lie In that dusky thicket yonder. [Exeunt. TUZANÃ. Did you hear him? ALCUZCUZ. I heard nothing. TUZANÃ. Doubtless 'tis the night-patrol Circling in its rounds the mountain; It was well that I retired: Are they gone? ALCUZCUZ. What, can't you see? TUZANÃ. I must now approach still nearer. [A report of a cannon is heard within. What means this? ALCUZCUZ. There's not a mouth That more clearly tells its meaning Than the wide mouth of a cannon Speaking the dead languages. [The mine explodes with tremendous noise. VOICES, within. Aid us, Heaven! ALCUZCUZ. Mahomet aid me! And may Allah guard you, master! TUZANÃ. It would seem as if were shaken On their everlasting axes, All the mighty sphere of crystal, All the huge round rocky globe. DON LOPE DE FIGUEROA, within. Now the mine is sprung, brave soldiers, Forward, forward to the breach. TUZANÃ. Oh! what Etnas, Mongibellos, What volcano, what Vesuvius, Must these mountains have conceived, That they bring forth such an offspring! ALCUZCUZ. Who are you calling mangy fellows, And the rest of those hard names?â It is all but fire and smoke. TUZANÃ. O unequalled burst of terror! Since in sudden wild confusion Now the startled city burns; And, to shorten all the horrors, Snakes of liquid pitch, and serpents Of explosive powder eat Through and through its very entrails; 'Tis the ruin of our Spain!â It were neither like a lover, Nor a brave man, if to succour My belovÃ©d, 'mid the blazing City I did throw me not, Climbing up its walls and dashing All its glittering turrets down, That I may in my embraces Bear the fair Maleca forth; Then Galeraâthen the mighty World itself may burn to dust. [Exit. ALCUZCUZ. Neither lover-like nor noble Were it now, in this confusion, Zara to desert; what matter? Being neither lord nor lover, And I've had enough of both; If I only save my bacon, (Allah, pardon me!) Galera, Zara, too, may burn for me. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter DON JUAN DE MENDOZA, DON LOPE DE FIGUEROA, GARCES, and Soldiers. LOPE. Give no quarter, fire the city, Give it o'er to flames and blood. GARCES. To begin the conflagration I shall enter. [Exit. FIRST SOLDIER. I shall follow. [Exit. Enter MALEC and some Moors fighting with the Christians. MALEC. I shall place my body here As a bastion to the ramparts To defend them. MENDOZA. This, my Lord, Is old Malec the Alcaide. LOPE. Yield thee. MALEC. Yield! what does it mean? MALECA, within. Malec! O my lord, and father! MALEC. 'Tis Maleca; Oh, my daughter, That I could divide in twain! MALECA, within. Ah! a Christian's hand doth slay me. MALEC. Then shall these too kill me here Unopposed, that in one moment Both our lives may end at once. LOPE. Die, thou dog, and bear Mahomet These my compliments from me. [After a severe struggle the Moors are defeated, and driven off the stage; the conquerors re-enter with GARCES. FIRST SOLDIER. There was never such a plunder Both of jewels and of diamonds. SECOND SOLDIER. This time I am rich at least. GARCES. Not a life to-day was sacred From my swordânor youth, nor beautyâ Nor old feeble age escaped me; All I failed in was to meet with That deceitful Moorish scoundrel, To be thoroughly avenged. LOPE. Now that all Galera burneth, It is best drawn off our people, Ere the flames being seen afar Bring help hither:â MENDOZA. Pass the signal To retreat:â ALL. Pass round the word. [Exeunt. SCENE III. âINSIDE THE WALLS OF GALERA. Enter TUZANÃ. TUZANÃ. Through the flames that rose like mountains, Through the sea of blood advancing, Treading upon prostrate corses: Fondest love has led me hither To the house of my Maleca. Ah! I find it torn and shatter'd, Victim of a double ruinâ Fire and sword have fallen upon it! But my bride, my bride, where art thou? If thou'rt lost, let sorrow make me Quick to die, as slow to aid thee; Where art thou my loved Maleca? Ah! my eyes discover nothing!â MALECA, within. Oh! alas! TUZANÃ. These mournful accents, Which the wind around me scattersâ Sad complaints obscurely spoken, Bitter sighs, too well repeated, Pierce my breast like lightning flashes. Ah! was ever such affliction? By the glimmering light arising From the half-expiring embers, I behold a woman lying With her blood the fire allaying, Ah! it isâit is Malecaâ Sacred Heavens, bestow in pity Life on her, or death on me:â [He enters, and returns with MALECA in his arms. Her hair hangs loosely about her, the blood flows from her wound, and she is but half-dressed. MALECA. Spanish soldier, in whose bosom Cruelty nor pity dwellethâ Pity, since thy hand has struck me.â Cruelty, since death still tarriesâ Plunge again thy murderous weapon In my breastâ'twill be less cruel Than to leave me thus suspended 'Twixt your cruelty and pity. TUZANÃ. Fair but most unhappy being! Thou, a goddess in thy beauty, Thou, a mortal in thy griefs, Since divinest natures ever Taste of earthly pangs as wellâ He who in his arms doth hold thee, Does not seek to take thy life. Ah, to save that life he'd rather Lose his own a thousand times. MALECA. By these accents I discover That thou art of Moorish blood. If my sex, my sorrow move thee With a double power to pityâ Grant one favour for the two. In Gabia is Alcaide, TuzanÃ­, my dearest husband: Thither hasten thou to seek himâ And this last embrace I give thee, Bear him faithfully from me; Tell him that his bride, Maleca, Bathed and weltering in her blood, By a Spaniard's hand outpoured,â By a Spaniard, more ambitious Of her jewels than of honour, Died this day in lost Galera. TUZANÃ. The embrace which thou hast given me, It is needless that I carry To your husband; for, alas! End of all his dreams and rapture! He himself is here to take it. MALECA. Ah! this voice so well rememberedâ Voice of one so dearly lovedâ Sends new breath into my bosom, Makes my death supremely happy. Let me once again embrace theeâ Let me die within thy arms. [Dies. TUZANÃ. Oh, how much that man betrayed his Ignorance of human nature; He who said that love doth ever Blend two separate lives in one! If such miracles were real, Neither I would now be living, Nor wouldst thou be lying dead. Since, indeed, this very moment, Thou by living, I by dying, Were our destinies alike! Heavens, that witness my affliction, Mountains, that behold my anguish, Birds, that hear my sad complainings, Flames, that see my bosom's sorrow, Why, oh! why have ye permitted That the brightest light is darkened, That the fairest flower has perished, That the sweetest breath has failed? Men, who've known love's sacred feeling, Aid me in this deep affliction, Tell me, in this hour of woe, What is he to do, the lover, Who, the night he comes to visit His adored, espousÃ©d lady, Hoping to receive the guerdon Of his long and faithful love, Finds her in her young blood lying? Sweetest lily ever pictured On a perilous enamel!â Purest gold that ever brightened In the crucible of grief!â What ought he to do, the mourner, Who his bridal bed beholdeth Changed into a mournful tomb, And the goddess he expected Lying there a pallid corse? Butâno, noâyou will not answer; Aid nor counsel will you give. If my grief, in such misfortune, Will not prompt my mind aright, Vain is all advice or counsel. Mountain of the Alpujarra!â Theatre of coward slaughter!â Scene of the most vile transaction!â Field of the most shameful conquest! And the most degraded gloryâ Never, never have your mountainsâ Never, never have your valleys, Seen, amid your pointed summitsâ Seen, along your flowery marginsâ One so fair and so unhappy! But of what avails complaining, What avails my lamentation, If 'tis lost in idle air? [Enter ABENHUMEYA, LIDORA, and Moors. ABENHUMEYA. Though, with tongues of fire, Galera Called us from afar to aid her, We have come too late. LIDORA. In ashes See her squares, and streets, and buildings, And the red flames pyramidal Seem to rise unto the stars. TUZANÃ. Do not wonderâdo not tremble That your steps have been too tardyâ I myself have come too late! ABENHUMEYA. Oh! what words of mournful boding. LIDORA. Oh! what terror is impending? ABENHUMEYA. What is this? TUZANÃ. It is the greatest Pain, it is the deepest sorrow. The calamity most cruel, The misfortune most profound. 'Tis to see expire before you, In a way so sad and mournful, Her you love. Ah! this in truth Is all sorrows in one sorrowâ Is the summit of misfortuneâ Is the grief of every grief. My Maleca (ah! my sorrow, How canst thou proclaim the tidings?)â My Maleca, my betrothed, Is the corse so pale and bloody, Coldly lying at thy feet! A treacherous hand, a burning brand, Plunged within her glowing bosom, And the flame of life extinguished! Who will not behold with wonder Fire extinguished thus by fire, And the precious gem of life By the sharp steel cleft asunder? You can every one bear witness Of this sacrilegious outrage; Of this cruel wrongâthis horrorâ This most costly, bitter trial Of fatality and love. Be ye witnesses, henceforward, Of my deep, undying vengeance, The most dreadful, the most noble, That the world has ever entered In her chronicles of jasparâ In her monuments of bronze. Here, before this lifeless beautyâ This weak flowerâthis fragile roseâ Who at length doth die a wonder, As a wonder she was bornâ Here with unavailing homage, Bending at her feet, I vow For her death eternal vengeance! And since this Galera (truly Well it meriteth the name!) Galeraâa Galley. Founders in this purple sea, And, 'mid flames that rise around it, Threatens to sink headlong downward From this peak to yonder valesâ Since the Spaniards have departed, So that the faint, distant beating Of their drums now reach us notâ I shall follow in their footsteps, Till I find, amid their army, Him, the wretch, that slew my brideâ At the least his life shall answer My revenge, if not her death! That the fire that saw the murderâ That the world which knew 'twas doneâ That the trembling wind that listenedâ That the fortune that allowed itâ That the Heavens which this permittedâ Men, and beasts, and birds, and fishesâ Sun, and moon, and flowers, and starsâ Fire, and air, and earth, and waterâ Thus may learn, may know, may publish, See, observe, and comprehend, That within a Moorish heart, That within a Moorish bosom, Love surviveth after Death! Thus that cruel god shall never Boast that he had power to tear Two such hearts from one another! [Exit. ABENHUMEYA. Stay! detain thee. LIDORA. You would sooner Make the lightning's flash obey. ABENHUMEYA. Take away the lifeless body Of this fair unfortunate; Be not, valiant friends, disheartened At beholding this rude Troy Falling thus in rustic homage On the horror-feeling earth, Or in ashes heavenward rising; Since, ye Moors of the Alpujarra, To avenge such wrongs as theseâ Has your king AbÃ©nhumÃ©ya Bound this sword around his loins. [Exit. LIDORA. Would to Heaven that these mountainsâ That these proud Atlantic hillsâ With the fire that now consumes themâ With the wind that beats their sides, Saw themselves now toppling overâ Saw themselves with age decayâ That at length a termination Might be reached of all these woes. [Exit. SCENE IV. âTHE CHRISTIAN CAMP. Enter DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA, DON LOPE DE FIGUEROA, DON JUAN DE MENDOZA, and soldiers. DON JOHN. Since that this proud city here, This Galera lies in ruinâ And awaiting its renewing, One vast phenix doth appearâ And of all that burning sphere Which eternal vengeance wokeâ Seems a burning fragment broke From the region of God's ire,â A very minotaur of fireâ A very labyrinth of smokeâ We no longer should remain,â But before the morning peeps Over the hills, and smiling weeps Those tears which in the foaming main Turn into glistening pearls again, We from Galera should retreat And to Berja fly as fleet; Since at rest I ne'er shall be, Till this Moorish king I see Dead or conquered at my feet. LOPE. If you wish, my lord, that we Do, at Berja, what we've done At Galeraâere the sun Sinks again, it so shall be; But, as it appears to me, The king our gracious ruler meant Not to destroy the malcontent Who are his vassals still, but merely To chastise themâtrue, severelyâ But blending grace with punishment. MENDOZA. I with Don Lope must agree; Cruel yet merciful, they should Behold you in your milder mood, Since they have seen thy cruelty:â Yes, permit them now to be Spectators of the heartfelt joy, With which by mercy's mild alloy Thou temperest vengeance, and so give A proof that valour can forgiveâ Since 'tis not valour to destroy. DON JOHN. My brother sent me, it is true, To pacify this rebel land, But without my sword in hand My anger knows not how to sue; Still as he permits me too, To pass or punish crimes like theirsâ The world shall know from these affairs, That, as the occasion needs, With arms I punish rebel deedsâ With pardon welcome humble prayersâ Don Juan. MENDOZA. Please your grace? DON JOHN. Away To Berja, where ValÃ³r, I know Has raised his standard; that I go To Berja, upon my part, say; There publicly in the face of day Offer pardon or punishment: Good and evil equally blent: Say, if he doth yield to me At discretion, I, by thee A general amnesty have sent To all the rebelsâthat they may Return and live with us once more, Resume the rank they held before This foul rebellion's fatal day. For all their crimes now past away, As things of a forgotten eraâ I shall ask no more severe a Punishment: if he saysânoâ Then on Berja I shall blow The burning ashes of Galera. MENDOZA. I go thy servant. [Exit. LOPE. Never did The sack of any town I have known Turn out so well; each soldier's grown Rich with the wealth he found amid The walls. DON JOHN. And was such treasure hid Galera's narrow walls between? LOPE. Let the joy that can be seen In every soldier's face reply. DON JOHN. I would wish to give by-and-by Unto my sister and my queen, Some gift to which she could refer As trophy of this victory,â From the soldiers I must buy Some offering worthy sending her. LOPE. I have been a purchaser With the very same intentâ This necklace which I bought to-day From one to whom it fell at playâ I would fain, my lord, presentâ A jewelled trophy of the event. DON JOHN. 'Tis fair, and I must not refuse, That you may not yourself excuse, SeÃ±or, hereafter from receiving As readily as now thou'rt giving;â Then to take, as now you choose To teach me how to give. LOPE, giving the necklace. I see Its value, since you condescend To make some use of it and me. Enter DON ALVARO TUZANÃ, and ALCUZCUZ, dressed as Spanish soldiers; they converse apart. TUZANÃ. Alcuzcuz, I have chosen thee For the exploit I intend, As my companion and my friend. ALCUZCUZ. You did well to trust to me:â Although you keep as in a sheath Your valorous projectânow this shyness ... But hush! for yonder is his Highness. TUZANÃ. Is this Don John? ALCUZCUZ. It is in faith:â TUZANÃ. A man about whom rumour saith Such deeds, is worthy of mine eyes. DON JOHN. How equal are these pearls in size? TUZANÃ. And if the reason that I mention, Would not account for my attention, Now one more potent doth arise. That pearly necklace (woe is me!) Which in his hands (O heavens!) I see, Is that which once, when Fate was kind, Around Maleca's neck I twined! DON JOHN. Let us, Don Lope, go: how he That soldier yonder seems enchained, Looking at me with eyeballs strained! LOPE. Who would not look so, please your grace, When he beholds you face to face? [Exeunt. TUZANÃ. Amazed and mute I have remained. ALCUZCUZ. Now tell me, since we are alone, Why from the Alpujarra near Have you descended and come here? TUZANÃ. Soon shall the cause be clearly shown. ALCUZCUZ. Yes, but the cause may not be known Until a greater cause have I To repent that I followed thee. TUZANÃ. And why? ALCUZCUZ. Listen and I will tell the cause: Lately, my lord, you know I was Taken a prisoner as a spy By a Christian soldier, now if he See me, he'll kill me. TUZANÃ. That can't be, Since no eye could now know you In this disguise; and so, we two May, without the slightest suspicion, Go through the camp upon our mission; Christians we will seem to their view, Since naught betrays that we are Moors. ALCUZCUZ. You, because with that tongue of yours You speak their language, and never were At any time their prisonerâ And seem a Spaniardâthis secures To you the safety you announce, But I, who know not how to pronounceâ I who know badly how to expressâ I a captiveâand unused to this dress, How am I my fears to renounce? TUZANÃ. By your only speaking to me: Besides, a servant will not be Noticed by every passer-by. ALCUZCUZ. If they ask me a question? TUZANÃ. Don't reply. ALCUZCUZ. That will be rather a difficulty. TUZANÃ. Not if you wish to avoid pursuit. ALCUZCUZ. Mahomet alone could make me mute, Being from the moment of my birth The greatest babbler on the earth. TUZANÃ. O wild, wild love's insensate fruit! I doubt not, oh! I do not doubt That men will say, that thou dost err, The fondâthe vain idolater Of a bright sun that has gone out, Vainly thus to roam about, To try 'mid thirty thousand men One single soldier here to find, Whom I follow like the wind Swift-sweeping over mount and glen, Without one mark to guide my ken; But deeper darkness clouding o'er; Still what is one new wonder more, When we can naught but wonders see? Well do I know, it scarce can be, That I, the vengeance that I swore, Can execute till years go byâ But what will I have done, if I Only attempt the possible?â Still though 'tis nigh infallible, The first clear trace I've seen in vainâ Because to me the thing is plainâ Whoe'er he beâthe fiend of hellâ He can't be noble, he who could Have dyed his hands in woman's bloodâ It neither argues bravery, Nor does it prove nobilityâ Not to view with admirationâ Not to feel with adorationâ What in its very self should be Woman's best guardâher lovelinessâ O love, in vain these signs express 'Twas he that did that crueltyâ Thy proofs are false, it was not he, It was another's vile addressâ Some traitorâmonsterâstruck the blow! ALCUZCUZ. Did you come here this fact to know? TUZANÃ. Yes. ALCUZCUZ. Then let us face about, For how expect to find him outâ A man you never saw? TUZANÃ. Although Not sanguine, I may find his track. ALCUZCUZ. 'Tis like the letter, that some one Sent superscribed, âTo my son John Who lives near the court and dresses in black.â TUZANÃ. Be sure address not old or young. ALCUZCUZ. Then my thoughts I must express By signs, to all I meet with? TUZANÃ. Yes. ALCUZCUZ. Tie up, O Allah! tie my tongue! Enter some SOLDIERS. FIRST SOLDIER. In this way I think the winnings Are divided very fairly, Since the man who plays for two Should have choice of his own portion. SECOND SOLDIER. Why should not the gain be equal, When the loss would have been so? THIRD SOLDIER. Yes, that seems but common justice. FIRST SOLDIER. Look now, I have got no fancy To have quarrels with my comrades Through an interested motive. Find me out a man, a stranger, Who will say that you have reason On your side, and I am mute. SECOND SOLDIER. Any one we meet will say it. Ho! friend soldier. [To Alcuzcuz. ALCUZCUZ, aside. Me he speaks to!â And I cannot answerâPatience!â THIRD SOLDIER. Will you not answer? ALCUZCUZ. Ha! ha! ha! FIRST SOLDIER. Oh! he is dumb:â ALCUZCUZ, aside. How well they know it! TUZANÃ, aside. He will certainly destroy me If I do not extricate him From the dilemma: brave hidalgoes, Pardon through your great indulgence This my servantâwho cannot Understand you, from his being Deaf and dumb. ALCUZCUZ, aside. I am not dumb, But it seems on this occasion Must be pique, repique, and capot, Trick'd as it were of every word. FIRST SOLDIER. What indeed we wished to ask him Is a matter that can better Be decided by yourself. TUZANÃ. Oh! I shall be proud to do so. FIRST SOLDIER. I, in playing for us both, Won a certain sum of money And this Cupid.... TUZANÃ, aside. Oh! my sorrow! FIRST SOLDIER. Formed of diamonds:â TUZANÃ, aside. Ah! Maleca, The very jewels of thy marriage Are relics of thy obsequies: How, oh! how shall I avenge theeâ If from one extreme to the other, From the prince to the common soldier, Fly the proofs of thy foul murder? FIRST SOLDIER. Coming to divide the winnings, I have offered him the Cupid As his share of what we wonâ But he says he wants not trinkets: Look now, having gained the stakes, If I should not get a preference In the dividing. TUZANÃ. With your leave I may reconcile the difference, Having come so opportunelyâ Giving for this gem the sum That you won, as you have mentioned: But with only this condition That you point me out the man Who first owned itâto secure me In my purchase. SECOND SOLDIER. All that's played for Is to-day a safe investment,â As it forms the booty won, In the sacking of Galera, From these dogs. TUZANÃ, aside. O heavens! that I Thus should listen to this outrage! ALCUZCUZ, aside. Oh! that I can neither kill him Nor even answer what he says. FIRST SOLDIER. I will show you the first owner, Who, as a token, told me how He with other jewels took it From a fair young Moorish maiden Whom he killed. TUZANÃ, aside. Ah! woe is me! FIRST SOLDIER. Come my friend, and you will hear it From himself:â TUZANÃ, aside. I shall not hear it, For the first word that he utters He beneath my dagger dies.â Let us go. [Aloud. VOICES within. Stand back! OTHER VOICES within. Away! A SOLDIER, within. I shall kill him on the instant, Though the whole world should defend! ANOTHER SOLDIER, within. He has sided now against us. ANOTHER, within. Then my comrade, kill him, kill!â GARCES, within. That you all should be opposed? Enter GARCES and SOLDIERS, fighting. TUZANÃ. Though I am alone, what matter So many against one! O soldiers, This is infamous; 'tis baseness; Back! or by the heavens above me I will force you to retire! [They fight. ALCUZCUZ, aside. Matters are progressing bravely, Here's a row without my speaking. A SOLDIER. I am slain! Enter DON LOPE DE FIGUEROA, with a guard. LOPE. What's this? A SOLDIER, to the others. He's killed! Fly, that we may not be taken. [Exit. GARCES. Soldier, thou hast saved my life, And the debt I shall repay thee. [Exit with the rest of the soldiers. LOPE. Hold there! soldier! TUZANÃ. I obey thee. LOPE. From the two their arms removeâ Take his sword. TUZANÃ, aside. And this, O Heaven!â Let your lordship be advised [Aloud. That I drew it but for peace-sake, Since the quarrel was not mine. LOPE. All I know is, at the guard-room That I found you with it naked In your hand, beside a corse. TUZANÃ, aside. Ah! I see defence is useless:â Has it happened till this moment He who came (as I) to killâ Finds himself in greater danger For the saving of a life. LOPE to ALCUZCUZ. You your sword have not surrendered,â Good! you only speak by signs, But as well as I remember You had a tongue another time,â In the guard-house place these prisonersâ Keep these two securely there, Until I o'ertake the others. ALCUZCUZ, aside. Two things lately gave me troubleâ Silence and the quarrel; now If I can tot up correctly One, two, three, yes, three there areâ Silence, quarrel, and a prison. [They are led out. Enter DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA. DON JOHN. What has now occurred, Don Lope? LOPE. There has been, my lord, a quarrel, And a soldier has been slain. DON JOHN. If we did not sometimes punish Matters of this kind, each day Would produce a thousand murders. But we must, with discipline Temper mercy. Enter DON JUAN MENDOZA. MENDOZA, kneeling. At your Highness' Feet I kneel. DON JOHN. What news, Mendozaâ How replies Abenhumeya? MENDOZA. A peaceful trumpet loud I blew As I reached the walls of Berjaâ And a silent snow-white banner Quickly answered to the trumpet, Then securely I passed onward To the canopy, or rather Heaven of proud Abenhumeya, Since beside him there was seated DoÃ±a Isabel his queenâ She whose name is now Lidoraâ (Love! how vainly you awaken Slumbering seeds of former fires!) They as is the Moorish custom Led me to a cushioned hassock, Giving as ambassador, Unto me the same precedence That to monarchs doth belong, I my embassy then opened, And the tidings scarce were heard, That you gave a general pardon, When through all the streets and plazas Festal joy and gladness ranâ But the proud Abenhumeya, Son of valour and of pride, Burning with his rage at seeing How at promise of the pardon Thus the fickle people changed, Gave to me this haughty answer:â I am king of the Alpujarraâ And although the realm is small, Soon will Spain, a larger empire, Lay submissive at my feetâ If you do not wish to see him Lying dead, go tell Don John To retire with all his forces, And if any base Morisco Wishes for this amnesty, Take the wretched recreant with theeâ Let him aid in Philip's war Against his kinsmenâwe shall only Have a foe the more to conquer: With this answer he dismissed me, And I left the Alpujarra Arming now in hostile bands, Some of them âSpain!â âSpain!â proclaiming, Some proclaiming âAfricaââ So that now a greater ruinâ Now a greater gulf for them Opens wideâsince feuds intestine Rage unchecked within their gates. DON JOHN. Never doth a rebel king Hold his power with long duration, Or increase; because even those Who at first came flocking round him, Are, at last, the first to leave him Bathed perchance in his own blood: In this state is the Alpujarra; So, before these human vipers Bite, with poisoned teeth, each other, Let us move the camp to Berja; Let us rather conquer them Ere they've time themselves to conquerâ That they may not share the glory Which must solely be our own. [Exeunt. SCENE V. âTHE INTERIOR OF THE GUARDHOUSE. Enter DON ALVARO TUZANÃ and ALCUZCUZ, with their hands tied behind their backs. ALCUZCUZ. The first moment now that we Are alone, and I can speak A word or two, I wish to seek, SeÃ±or TuzanÃ­, from thee, Why from the Alpujarra hill Came we here, both you and I,â Was it to kill, or was it to die? TUZANÃ. To die, but not before I kill. ALCUZCUZ. You ought to keep at a civil distance When people quarrel and loosely aim. TUZANÃ. Knowing I was not to blame, I did offer no resistance; If this heart, so yielding then, Wished it, nothing could restrain meâ A thousand men would not detain me. ALCUZCUZ. I'd trust it to the thousand men. TUZANÃ. Shall I miss then that inhuman Monsterâshall he 'scape mine eyesâ Who could boast he gained a prize By the murder of a woman? ALCUZCUZ. That in my mind is a lesser Evil, than be made confess: For they have ordered thisâno lessâ What will we do with a confessor, Being no Christians, I or you? TUZANÃ. Now that every hope is lost, My life a fearful sum will cost. ALCUZCUZ. Why no, what do you mean to do? TUZANÃ. To kill the sentinel on the spot. ALCUZCUZ. With what hands? TUZANÃ. I will not lack Your teeths' sure help behind my back, To untie this cord's strong knotâ I have my dagger, which concealed Lies in the girdle round my waistâ And which the tunic round it placed Prevented being then revealed. ALCUZCUZ. Teeth and behind!âwell, well, the affair Is not the nicestâgood, my lord. TUZANÃ. Quickly break or loose the cord. ALCUZCUZ. So I am doing. TUZANÃ. Have no care, No one shall see you. [ALCUZCUZ. unties the cord. ALCUZCUZ. It has wrung My teeth outânow my turn. TUZANÃ. 'Tis vain Now to attempt it. ALCUZCUZ. I remain Tied up at once both hands and tongue. Enter the SENTINEL, and GARCES, in chains. SENTINEL. Your comrade, who you say, did come So opportunely to your aid So bravely with his fearless blade, And his servant who is dumb, Are both here. GARCES. Though I regret To be arrested for this feudâ Such a crowd my steps pursued, Still if it permits the debt Of gratitude to be repaid To him, to whom my life I oweâ I shall rejoice that it is so,â And turn the evil to his aidâ Go to Don Juan, go from me, And to my lord Mendoza say, How I a prisoner in this way Ask as a gracious boon that he Should come to see me in this place, Since from Don John I wish that he Would ask my life, my liberty, For what I've done to serve his Grace. SENTINEL. I will tell him what you have said When off duty by-and-by. TUZANÃ to ALCUZCUZ. You can look round carelessly And see what stranger now is led Into the prison. ALCUZCUZ. I will look: Good Heavens: [Recognises GARCES. TUZANÃ. How now? ALCUZCUZ. That I were dumb Or dead, for he who now has come...... TUZANÃ. Proceed. ALCUZCUZ. The blood my cheek forsook. TUZANÃ. Speak on. ALCUZCUZ. I cannot live, through fear...... TUZANÃ. Explain. ALCUZCUZ. My captor isâthe man With whose food away I ran; Doubtless he has heard I'm here, And has followed to this place; Whether yes, or whether no, I shall hide myself, that so He may not behold my face. [He covers his head and lies down as if to sleep. GARCES. Since indeed, although a stranger Never serving thee in aughtâ Thou hast still beside me fought, And snatched me from the midst of dangerâ Soon I hope (let this elate thee) By my aid to liberate theeâ 'Tis my only consolation. TUZANÃ. God preserve thee! ALCUZCUZ, aside. Ah! I see 'Tis for the riot he is here, Like ourselves a prisonerâ Perchance he did not notice me In the heat of the fight. GARCES. In fine, Do not thou, Hidalgo, mind Being here a while confined; For the fault being only mine, Sooner than their hands shall touch A hair of thine, my life shall pay The debt I have incurred to-day. TUZANÃ. Indeed I did expect as much; But know, I do not waste a thought Upon my being prisoned here, I grieve, because I've lost, I fear The only object that I sought. SENTINEL. Do not fear you both shall dieâ For I've heard old people tellâ As yourselves know just as wellâ When a man, by chance, comes by His death, if it be perpetrated By several persons, and 'tis found That he received but a single wound, Which was not premeditated, For the offence but one doth payâ Namely the man in such a case Who has the most forbidding face. ALCUZCUZ, aside. May he be burnt who so doth say! SENTINEL. And so I think of all you three, It is the dumb man that must die:â [Exit. ALCUZCUZ, aside. Truly obliged indeed am I, Just as if my face must be The ugliest:â GARCES. I cannot rest Until from out this place I draw You forth to freedom. ALCUZCUZ, aside. Is it law To put to death the ugliest? GARCES. May I at least the name repeat Of him who saved my life? TUZANÃ. Oh! I Am but a soldier, come to try And find a man I seek to meet. GARCES. Your friendly courage well deserves That I should tell you where to goâ What is his name? TUZANÃ. I do not know. GARCES. What is the corps with which he serves? TUZANÃ. I do not know it. GARCES. His appearance? TUZANÃ. I do not know. GARCES. To find him, then, Among so many thousand men, Methinks will need some perseverance. TUZANÃ. And yet, an hour ago, without My knowing either form, or name, Or the corps with which he came, I had almost found him out. GARCES. These enigmas are too great For me to guess: but be not sad, For his Highness will be glad To serve and aid you, when I state The service that to me you rendered; He owes me much, since, but for me It ne'er had been his lot to see Galera's bastioned walls surrendered. This search between us we'll divide, For, forced by gratitude's strong power, In good and evil, from this hour My chosen place is at thy side. TUZANÃ. And were you then, indeed, the first Within Galera's walls to go? GARCES. Ah! would to God it were not so! TUZANÃ. Why does the memory seem accurst? GARCES. Because from that unlucky hour That first I placed my foot therein, I know not for what deadly sin, Misfortune, with malignant power, Or Fate, or some stern star malign, Or Retribution's wrath, has shed Its baneful influence o'er my head, And all goes wrong with me and mine. TUZANÃ. Why art thou thus so much dismayed? GARCES. I know not, if 'twas not that day On which it was my fate to slay A young and beauteous Moorish maid. Indeed, just Heaven can do no less Than strike me for a deed so base, For heaven was copied in her face. TUZANÃ. Was she so beautiful? GARCES. Oh, yes. TUZANÃ. Alas! unhappy spouse! But say, [Aside. How did this chance? GARCES. 'Twas in this way: On a certain day being stationed Sentinel within a forest, 'Neath the thick o'erhanging branches Which diffused the gloom of midnight Down along the sloping mountains, There I seized a Moorish prisoner. It were tedious to discover How he managed to deceive me; 'Tis enough to say, he led me Far away 'mid precipices, Where his shouts soon called together All the troops of Alpujarra. Flying, then, I sought for shelter In a deep and darksome grotto, Where the fatal mine was opened Through the hollow rock soon afterâ Dreadful monster, which conceiveth So much fire within its entrails! It was I who first revealed it To my lord, Don John of Austria; It was I who, through the night-time, Guarded it from all surprises; It was I who held the entrance Till my comrades took possession; It was I, in fine, who entered First amid the flaming city, Like a human salamander. Till, at length, I reached, by passing Globes of fire, a strong-built mansion, Which was, without doubt, the fortress Of the place, for there the people Were assembled in great numbers.â But, perchance, you have grown weary Of my story, 'twill fatigue you To pay any more attention. TUZANÃ. Pray excuse me, I was thinking Of my own affairsâcontinue. GARCES. In effect, I hurried onward, Full of anger, full of fury, Till I reached the house of Malec, (It the cause of all my anguish.) 'Twas the time that round the palace, Or the mansion, or the fortress, Don Lope de Figueroaâ Light and honour of his countryâ Had drawn up his valiant forces, And the flames were bursting redly From the walls, and the Alcaide Was no more. And I, who ever Seek for prizes as for plauditsâ Though, indeed, rewards and honours Seldom can be found togetherâ Daringly ambitious, onward Through the halls and rooms I wandered, Till I reached a little chamber, Last retreat of the most lovely Moorish maid my eyes e'er gazed on. Ah! my words were vain to paint her, Were it even the time for painting! Startledâfrightenedâsorely troubled, When she saw me, she concealed her Down behind her bed's white curtains, As if they, indeed, that moment Were the curtain of a rampart.â But what mean these tears that trickle Down your face so pale and haggard? TUZANÃ. They, indeed, are but mementos Of a similar misfortune. GARCES. Do not heed the lost occasion. Him you wish to find, believe me, You will meet without your seeking. TUZANÃ. You speak truly. Pray continue. GARCES. I pursued her; she was covered With so many sparkling jewels, With a dress so rich and splendid, That she seemed a bride expecting Her belovÃ©dânot a victim Waiting for the coming death-stroke. I, beholding so much beauty, Wished to save her life, provided She would give her heart as ransom. Scarcely had I dared to touch her Snow-white hand, when thus she prayed me: âChristian, if you are desirous More of plunder than of gloryâ Since a woman's blood doth ever Stain the sword, man's blood doth brightenâ Let your thirst be satiated By these jewels that I carry; Leave untouched my faith, my honour; Touch not this poor breast that carries Many mysteries within it, Which itself doth comprehend not.â In my arms I seizedâ TUZANÃ. Oh! torture! Pause a moment!âstay!âdetain thee!â But what words are these? My fancy Makes me use these exclamations. Pray continue your narration, Though to me 'tis not of momentâ Ah! I feel even more his daring [Aside. Thus to touch her, than to kill her! GARCES. Piercing cries aloud she uttered In defence of life and honour. I being now aware that others Were approaching the apartment, And that one of two rich conquests Which I sought, must be abandoned, Fearing that they both should fail me, Or that one should be divided With the soldiers who might enter, Changing, in a little moment, Thus my love to quicker vengeance (Easily doth passion change from One extreme unto another), Hurried by some unknown fury, Frenzied by some sudden madness, Which impelled my armâ(I know not How to tell so base an action)â I, removing first a necklace Made of pearls, and many a diamondâ Leaving after them a heaven All of purest snow, rose-tintedâ Plunged my sword within her bosom. TUZANÃ. Was the stroke like this? assassin!â [Draws out his dagger and stabs him. GARCES. Oh! heavens! ALCUZCUZ. Well done! TUZANÃ. Thou traitor, die! GARCES. Is it by your hand I perish? TUZANÃ. Yes, for this poor murdered beauty, This sweet rose whose leaves are scattered, Soul of my life was she when living, Life of my soul is she this moment, You are he whom I was seeking! This the cause that drew me thitherâ To revenge her outraged beauty! GARCES. Ah! without my arms to strike me, And with treachery! TUZANÃ. Vengeance never Stoppeth for such calculations,â 'Tis her husband, Don Alvaro TuzanÃ­, whose hand has slain thee. ALCUZCUZ. And 'tis I, thou dog of a Christian, Alcuzcuz, who in the mountains Carried off thy saddle bags. GARCES. Since it was thy fate to give me Death, why first have given me life? Ho! within there, guard! O heavens! [Dies. DON JUAN MENDOZA, within. What can mean these cries? Quick, open Bolt and barâ'tis Garces calleth, Whom I hither come to seek:â Enter DON JUAN MENDOZA and SOLDIERS. MENDOZA. What means this? TUZANÃ, snatching a sword from one of the soldiers. This sword surrender:â SeÃ±or Don Juan de Mendoza, If my daring thus appals thee, Know that I am TuzanÃ­, The thunderbolt of the Alpujarra, Who has hither come to avenge him For the death of a peerless beauty, Since he knows not how to love Who, the lov'd one, can avenge not:â In another cell I sought you, Where we measured equal arms, Face to face, and body to body. If you seek me here in turn, You should have approached this prison Singly, for being who you are, You alone had been sufficient; If by chance you have come hither, (Noble minds are ever prompt Nobly to prevent misfortunes) Grant me a free exit hence. MENDOZA. TuzanÃ­, I would be happy That in such a strange conjuncture, If with honour, I could give Thee protection, in thy going:â But you see that that were failing In my duty to the king, And that duty bids me slay thee When thou'rt in his army found. TUZANÃ. 'Tis to me of little moment That you ope the door or no, Since my sword a way will open. [He attacks the soldiers. A SOLDIER. Oh! I'm slain! ANOTHER SOLDIER. He is a fury Loosened from the abyss of hell. TUZANÃ. Now you will see, if I am truly TuzanÃ­, whom Fame hereafter Will amid his other triumphs Call the Avenger of his Love. MENDOZA. Die before your vengeance cometh. ALCUZCUZ, aside. Is it not the ugliest, That the law declares must die first? Enter DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA, DON LOPE DE FIGUEROA, and SOLDIERS. LOPE. What occasions all this outcry? DON JOHN. Don Juan, what is this? MENDOZA. My lord, It is a singular occurrence: A Moor has hither come alone Down from the heights of Alpujarra To kill a man who killed his mistress In the storming of Galera, And he has stabbed him to the heart. LOPE. Did he kill your mistress? TUZANÃ. Yes:â LOPE. You did well:âmy lord, give orders For his freedom; his offence Calls more strongly for approval Than for punishment; yourself Would so act to him who'd outrage The lady that you love, or you Were not then Don John of Austria. MENDOZA. Remember this is TuzanÃ­, And that it is of great importance To secure him. DON JOHN. Yield thee prisoner. TUZANÃ. Though thy valour doth command it, I, my lord, cannot obey. But on thy account, shall only Go when I designed to strike. [Exit. DON JOHN. Follow, soldiers! all pursue him! [They enter following TUZANÃ. SCENE VI. âBEFORE THE WALLS OF BERJA. Enter DOÃA ISABEL (LIDORA), and Moorish soldiers on the walls. LIDORA. With this white flag make a signal To the approaching Christian camp. Enter DON ALVARO TUZANÃ. TUZANÃ. Between angry pikes and halberds Have I forced my way, until I have reached the foot of the mountain. A voice within. Ere he gets within the outworks Strike him with a musket-ball. Enter soldiers pursuing him. TUZANÃ. You are far too few; surround me! A SOLDIER. To the entrenchment! LIDORA. TuzanÃ­, My lord, my brother, stay! TUZANÃ. Lidora, All these soldiers, arm'd and breathless, Follow me. LIDORA. Thou need'st not fear them. DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA, within. Tree by tree, and bough by bough, Waste the country till you find him. Enter DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA, Soldiers, and ALCUZCUZ. LIDORA. Generous Don John of Austria, Son of that renowned eagle Who, the sun sees face to faceâ For this mountain so rebelliousâ So opposed to your desireâ Now a woman, if thou'lt hear her, Comes a suppliant to thy feet. I am DoÃ±a Isabel TuzanÃ­, by force detained here Like a Moor in outward seeming But a Catholic in my heart;â Widow of Abenhumeyaâ Whose unhappy death has crimsoned By their arms his regal crownâ For the Moors upon the tidings Of the amnesty you offered, Wished to gain it, (since the crowd, Ever fickle and inconstantâ What they wish for most to-day Will abandon on the morrow)â Seeing that Abenhumeya Wished to shame their cowardice, His own body-guard one day Entering the royal chamber, Even where the throne was placed, And the door being curtained over, They addressed the monarch, saying,â Yield thee to the King of Spain:â I to yield! he said in answer, And his sword would then have drawn, But a soldier struck him swiftly On the head with a partisanâ That illustrious head, whose fortunes Seemed as if co-equal emblems Both of honour and dishonour:â He fell dead, and with him fell All those hopes that hung suspended On his life: the doubtful issue Making Spain to tremble more At the long-impending evil Than if it occurred;âthe people All took up the cry and shouted, Live the sacred Austrian name!â If, my lord, to see the Moorish Diadem of fair Granada Fallen from the royal forehead Of the brave Abenhumeya Merits favour, let it be That you grant free grace and pardon To the noble TuzanÃ­;â At thy gracious feet, thus kneeling I feel prouder as thy servant Than when here I reigned a queen. DON JOHN. Ah! too small a boon you ask me; Beauteous Isabel, arise!â Live, brave TuzanÃ­: and ever Let thy storyâthe most strange Deed that love has ever acted In the world's admiring sightâ Let it ever live engraven Deep in memory's lasting bronze. TUZANÃ. I kiss thy feet. ALCUZCUZ. Am I too pardon'd? DON JOHN. Yes. TUZANÃ. And thus is ended now âLove that liveth after Deathâ And the Siege of the Alpujarra. END OF LOVE AFTER DEATH.</field>
