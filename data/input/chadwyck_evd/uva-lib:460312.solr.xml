      <field name="fulltext">SCENE, ATHENS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter PANÃGYRIS and PINACIUM. PANÃGYRIS. Penelope, I think, was from her soul Unhappy, sister, to have liv'd so long Barr'd from her husband's love, a widow'd life. Her sense of this, we judge of from our own, Whose husbands are away; for whose affairs, We, as we ought, are anxious day and night. Pin. 'Tis fit we do our duty; and in that We do no other than affection dictates. But this way, sisterâI have much to say, Relating to my husbandâ Pan. Things go well, I hope, my dear?â Pin. I hope so too, and wish it. But I am vex'd, my sister, that your father, My father too, as just a man esteem'd As any in the city, should now act So false a part; injure our absent husbands So much; and that without a fault of theirs; Draw our affections from them tooâThese things Weary my life, are worse than age and troubles. Pan. Weep not, my sister; nor, in thought do that Your father threatensâWe'll hope better from him. I know him; know, he only says these things In jest; nor would he for the wealth of Persia, Dug from their mountains, said to be of gold, Confirm your fears by factsâNay, should he do so, It would but ill become us to be angry: Much may be said, nor, without reason said; For 'tis the third year of our husband's absence. Pin. 'Tis as you say.â Pan. And yet, whether alive, In health, or where, or what about, (if ought They are about) they make not us partakers, Nor yet returnâ Pin. Grieve you, that they neglect Their duty, sister, when you do your own? Pan. I do.â Pin. Be dumb! nor let me hear from you That sentiment againâ Pan. And wherefore, say? Pin. 'Tis my opinion, sister, that the wise Study their duty, and then practise itâ So, tho' my elder, I presume to advise That you forget not yoursâSay, they're unjust, Nor treat us as they ought, let us remember The duty we owe them, nor more expose Our weakness to their strength.â Pan. 'Tis right: I've done. Pin. Take heed then to remember it. Pan. I would not Be deem'd unmindful of my husband, sister, Nor shall he lose the favours he bestow'd.â By Pollux! noâHis kindness is my joy, And well am I contented with my lot; Nor do I seek e'en now to change my state. But after all, 'tis in our father's power: And well we know, parents must be obey'd. Pin. I know it, and that knowledge aids my sorrows; For he already has declar'd his sentiments. Pan. Then think we what remains for us to do. SCENE II. Enter ANTIPHO, [speaking to his servants within.] Ant. That servant, let me tell you, is no good one, Who waits till he has orders from his master; Nor of his own accord will do his business. Each month as it returns, you can remember To ask for your allotment of provisions; And why not think of what is to be done About the house?âIf then, at my return, I find not each part of the furniture Put in its proper place, I shall rub up Your memories with the advertisement Of a bull's pizzleâOne would almost think, Not men, but swine liv'd with me in the house. See it be clean at my return; for I Shall soon be back; I go but just to see My eldest daughter; and, if I am wanted, Call me from thence; or wait for my return, Which will be very soon. Pin. Say, if our father Should set himself against our resolution, What, sister, would you do? Pan. What do? submit. His power's the strongest. Ant. [apart.] Say, they choose their state, To remain here, rather than elsewhere marry? Why not? Is it for me, in my decline To war with them, who ne'er deserv'd it of me? No, noâI hate contentionâI'm convinc'd What's fitâBut how begin?âAy, there's the doubt. Shall I wind round about obscurely with them, As I'd no reason to find faultâNor had I Been well inform'd of their deserving blame. But shall I try them gently, or by threats? Oh! I shall hear enoughâI know them well. Pin. [apart to Pan.] Methinks, we shall do better by intreaty Than opposition. I do not despair To gain my father's favour, should I ask it. We can't oppose, but with disgrace and crime. Nor shall IâNor should you, might I advise. No, let us use intreatyâI do know Our father well; he's not inexorable. Ant. [apart.] YesâI will feign them guilty of some fault, Perplex their minds, and put them in some fright. That done, I shall know how to act; and, as I find, discover plainly my intentions.â I know we shall have words enoughâI'll inâ But see, the door is openâ Pin. Sure I hear My father's voice? Pan. By Castor's temple, he! Let us accost and kiss him. Pin. Sir, good day! [They both run to kiss him.] Ant. The same to youâWhat! both at once upon me! Have doneâAwayâ Pin. One kissâ Ant. Enough of kissing. Pin. Why so, my father? Ant. I'm overseason'd with it. Pin. Sit here, my father! Ant. No, I'll not sit there. Sit there yourselvesâI'll sit upon this bench. Pin. Stay till I fetch a cushion. Ant. For your care I thank youâAs it is, 'twill do for me. Pin. Give me leave, Sir. Ant. No needâ Pin. Indeed there is. [bringing a cushion.] Ant. Well, I submitâSoâsoâ'Tis very well. Pin. Children can never take too tender care Of a lov'd parentâWhom should we esteem More dear than you? And, next to you, our husbands, Of your own choiceâ Ant. You do as good wives should, And hold your absent husbands as if present. Pin. Decency, Sir, commands us honour those Who've chosen us companions throughout life. Ant. Is there no stranger here, to catch our words? Pin. None; but ourselves and you. Ant. Attend me then. Unskill'd in women's manners and affairs, I come to you a scholarâWhat endowments Should matrons have, the best esteem'd? Say both.â Pan. And why of us ask you of women's manners? Ant. Troth, as your mother's dead, I'm seeking out Another wifeâ Pan. You easily may find A worse wife, Sir, and one too of worse morals. A better, sure you'll never find, nor could The sun e'er shine on. Ant. 'Tis on that account I ask both your opinion, and your sister's. Pin. I know, by Pollux' temple, what they should be, Were they but such, as I think right, they ought. Ant. Say then your thought, what women ought to be. Pan. They ought in public to shut up their mouths, That none speak ill of them deservedly. Ant. Speak your opinion now in turn, Pinacium. Pin. And what, Sir, would you have me speak about? Ant. When is it best discern'd a woman has Good dispositions?â Pin. When mischief's in her power, And she restrains that power, and does it not. Ant. Not amiss that.âCome on.âWhat says the other? Of two conditions, which is best, to marry A maiden, or a widow? Pan. Sir, as far As my poor skill will go, of many evils, That evil which is least, is the least evil. He that can live without a woman, let him; And let him every day take special heed Never to do that thing to-day, the which He shall be sorry to have done, to-morrow. Ant. What sort of woman do you think the wisest? Pan. That woman, Sir, who in prosperity Can know herself; and, when affairs are not As once they have been, with an equal mind Can bear the disappointment. Ant. What I've done Was all by way of merriment, to try Your dispositions. This is the true business For which I came, and wish'd to meet you here. Some friends advise that I should take you hence To my own house immediately. Pan. But we, Whose interests are at stake, advise quite otherwise. Had you not lik'd the match, there was no reason Why you should choose these husbands for us formerly; And, as they're absent from us, 'twere unjust To bear us off to your own house again. Ant. What, shall I suffer you, while I'm alive To live with beggars for your husbands! Pin. Sir, My beggar is agreeable to me; Her king is to his queen agreeable, And she, the same in poverty or riches. Ant. Set you such value then on thieves and beggars? Pan. 'Twas to the man you married me, I thought, Not to his money. Ant. What! and are you still In expectation then of their return, After a three years absence?âWhy not rather Fly from the worst, and take the fairest offer? Pan. 'Tis folly, Sir, to lead folks to the chace Against their willâThat wife's an enemy, Who's wedded to her husband 'gainst her liking. Ant. Are you determin'd then, that neither of you Obey your father's will? Pin. We both determine On strict obedience; never to forsake The husbands you have given us. Ant. Then, farewell. I'll hence, and tell my friends your resolutions. Pan. Your friends, if honest, will not fail to think Our resolutions just. Ant. As you know how, Take the best care of their affairs at home. [Exit. Pan. Now pleas'd we listen to such good advice. Come, sister, let's go in. Pin. I'm first for home. If chance a message from your husband come, You'll let me know it. Pan. I'll hide nothing from you. Do you the same by meâHolla! Crocotium, Go fetch Gelasimus the Parasiteâ Bring him alongâI'd send him to the port. May hap some ship may have arriv'd from Asia To-day or yesterday.âI've still a slave Whole days in waitingâThis I send 'tween whilesâ Make haste, and back return immediately. [Exeunt severally. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter GELASIMUS the Parasite. I do suspect that famine was my mother. Since I was born, I never had a belly-full. Whatever grudgingly I have return'd her, She has never yet return'd the obligation. She in her womb bore me but just ten months, But my thin paunch has borne her ten long years. Again.âShe bore me but a little infant: The less the burden to her it should seem. 'Tis no small famine bear I in my guts; So great, by Hercules! I scarce support Myself, beneath the mighty pressure of it. My labour-pains increase continually; And, yet I know not how, I cannot bring This mother forthâI've heard it saidâ'tis commonâ The elephant goes ten years with her young.â My hunger's of that breed, for I have had it These many years clinging about my inside. Is there a droll, a pleasant fellow wanted, Here I'm for sale with all my equipage; For I at any rate would fill these chasms. My father, when I was a tiny boy, Nam'd me Gelasimus: for from my childhood Laughter I rais'd in allâA talent this I owe to povertyâBeing born poor, And fated so to liveâFor poverty Whom e'er she comes to, teaches every art. My father always said that I was born In time of dearth, which makes me sharper set. But then again, I have that easiness Of nature in me, I have not the heart To let a man invite me twice to supper, An ancient form of speech, by Hercules! And one, in my opinion, best, most elegant That e'er was us'd, is now grown obsolete, Come, sup with meâI prithee doâYour promiseâ 'Tis quite convenientâI must have it soâ I will not part with you, unless you'll comeâ But now they've got a damn'd vicarial word, The vilest of all sounds, I'd ask you home To sup with me, but that I sup abroadâ By Hercules! I wish that every limb Of that vile form were crippledânay, dead, murder'd, If the man after all did sup at home. These forms have so reduc'd me, I must learn Your foreign customs, and at last become The thin compendium of a common cryer; Proclaim an auction, and e'en sell myself. Enter CROCOTIUM. Cro. This is the man, the very Parasite I was despatch'd to fetchâE'er I accost him, I'll list to what he's sayingâ Gel. But here are A world of curious, mischief making folks, Still busied much in other men's affairs, Having no business of their own to mind. These, when they hear an auction is proclaim'd, Go to the cryer, sift out the why's and wherefores, Whether to pay a debt, or give a dinner, Or clear the dowry of a wife divorc'd. Such fellows I regard not of a rush. They labour for unhappiness, and sure They're worthy of their hire, and should receive it. Well! I'll rejoice them all, and plainly tell them The reason of my auction; for th'inquisitive, The busy fellow ever is ill-natur'd. Behold me then, myself the publick cryer Of my own auctionâLoss on loss I've suffer'd, My property has given me much affliction; Many a drinking-bout departed, goneâ How many suppers lost have I bewail'd! O what delicious drinking-bouts depriv'd of! What dinners lost within these last three years! I am grown old with wasting and vexation, And almost dead with hungerâ Cro. What a droll! None equal to him when he wants a dinner. Gel. 'Tis come to this, that I must make a sale Of all I haveâO yes!âDraw near, good people, It will be well for those that come and bid. First I put up my merry talesâCome onâ Now, bid awayâWho bids a supper for them? A dinner then!âWhy Hercules for that Will love youâSir, did you there bid a supper?â [to a spectator. Did you there nod to me?âNo Parasite Shall furnish you with better tales than mineâ I'll be outdone by no man, neither in My Grecian ointments for your sweating baths, Nor other delicates 'gainst a debauch, Nor quips, nor nice cajoleries, with store Of perjurations parasitical. This rusty strigil too, to rub you down, This empty vessel now dark brown with ageâ A Parasite, to make a voider of, [pointing to himself. To carry off your scrapsâNecessity Bids me sell all, and to the best advantage, That I may give the tenths to Hercules. Cro. A miserable auction, by my troth! The man seems plaguy hungry.âI'll accost himâ Gel. Who can this be, that's coming up to meet me? Crocotium sure, Epignomus's maid. Cro. Good day, Gelasimus. Gel. I've no such name. Cro. By Castor's temple, but it was your name. Gel. There you are rightâBut 'tis worn out with use. Now Miccotrogus is my nameâand aptly. Cro. I've had my belly-full of laughing at you This day, by Castorâ Gel. When and where? Cro. Why here, When you were selling off your goods by auction. Gel. What! did you hear it then, you baggage? Cro. Yes; And 'twas an auction worthy of the cryerâ Gel. Where are you going? Cro. Why, to look for you. Gel. On what account? Cro. PanÃ©gyris, my mistress, Has given strict orders to intreat your company Along with me directly to our house. Gel. By Hercules, fast as my legs can carry me. Are th'inwards dress'd? How many lambs are slain? Cro. She has not sacrific'd at allâ Gel. How, how! What wants she then with me? Cro. I think it is To ask you for ten bushels of your wheat. Gel. You mean that I should borrow them of her. Cro. No, that you lend as much to usâ Gel. Go, tell her I've nothing left to give, or lend, or spend, But this bare cloakâunless she'll buy my tongue. Cro. What! you've no tongue can say, I giveâ Gel. I've lost My old one; I've one left can say, give me. Cro. Plague take you! Gel. It returns the same to you. Cro. Well, will you come or no? Gel. Go, hie you home: Tell her, I come directlyâHaste, be goneâ [Exit Crocotium. I wonder she should bid them send for me, That never since her husband's absence, ask'd me. I cannot guess, unless she'd make a trial, If I would come, or noâI'll find her meaningâ But see, her boy DinaciumâDo but see, How like a pictur'd thing the fellow stands! How often has he drawn the wine to th'lees, And in a cup no bigger than my thumbâ [stands apart. SCENE II. Enter DINACIUM, with a fishing-rod, books, and a basket in his hand. Din. Not Mercury, the messenger of Jove, E'er carried to his father such good news As I have for my mistress.âI'm so laden With pure delight, I shall deliver nought, But in a stile magnificent and pompous. I bring the loves and graces to her ears, And my glad heart o'erflows its banks with joy. Dinacium, mend thy pace, and let thy speed Be worthy of thy messageâNow's the time To acquire praise, honour, immortal glory: Surpass the virtues of thy ancestors, Comfort thy longing mistress, who awaits With eagerness her husband, her Epignomus; Whom, as she ought, she lovesâHaste then, Dinacium, Fly, if you please, or runâNo notice take Of anyâElbow allâMake good your way, And, if a lord oppose you, knock him down. Gel. And whither runs at such a rate my wanton, My nice Dinacium, with his rod and hooks And basket in his hand? Din. [apart.] But after all My mistress ought indeed to come to me With cap in handâor send her messengers With golden presents, and a chariot ready To bring me homeâfor I can't walk afoot. I'll e'en turn backâ'Tis properer for her To come to me in supplicating moodâ Think you I nothing know, or trifles bring? Such news important from the port I tell, A treasure of such joy, my mistress dares not, Except she knows it, ask it of the gods. And shall I bear it of my own accord? I like it notânor think it is my duty. It more becomes the dignity, methinks, Of such a messenger, for her to come And beg me to impart to her this news. Great men take state upon them; and 'tis fit. Yet when I think again, how should she know, I am so knowing?âI have not the heart Not to return, to speak, to tell her all, To snatch her from her griefs, and in beneficence, Surpass the glories of my ancestors, And bring unhop'd for comfort to my mistress. Well! I'll outdo Talthybius himself, And look on other heralds with contempt. I shall prepare me for the Olympick games. But here's no spaceâA chariot cannot turn. This is unlucky.âHa! What's this?âThe door, I see, is shutâI'll up to it, and knockâ [knocks. Hast to the gateâOpen the door this momentâ See, if they stirâI'm shamefully neglectedâ How long must I stand knocking?âAll asleep! I'll try then which is strongest, or my feet And elbows, or the doorsâI wish the gate Had shewn its master a fair pair of heels, So it were furnish'd for'tâI'm tir'd with knocking. This knock, and this the lastâ [knocks again. Gel. I'll speak to him. Good day to you. Din. To you the same. Gel. What now? Turn'd fisherman? Din. How long is't since you eat? Gel. Whence come you? What ha'st there? Why in a hurry? Din. What's that to you, friend?âTrouble not yourself! Gel. What's in your basket there? Din. Snakes; don't you see them? Gel. Nay, why so angry? Din. If you'd any shame, You would not question me. Gel. Is there no truth To be got out of thee?â Din. Ay, marry! is there. You'll go to bed to-night without a supper. SCENE III. Enter PANÃGYRIS. Pan. Who broke these doors down, good now!âNay, where is he? Was't you?âWhat! come upon me like a thief?â [to Gelasimus. Gel. Madam, good day!âI come at your commandâ Pan. And for that reason must you break the door down? Gel. Chide your own peopleâThey are the offenders. I wait on you, to know your business with me. I thought 'twas pity that the doors should be So hurt. Din. So, you was ready to bring helpâ Pan. Who's that I hear so near me? Din. 'Tis Dinacium. Pan. Where?â Din. See him here: nor heed that hungry Parasite. Pan. Dinacium!â Din. So it was my elders call'd me. Pan. Well! what's the business? Din. Do you ask my business? Pan. Why should I not? Din. Why, what is yours with me? Pan. What! scorn me, impudence! Answer quick, Dinacium. Din. Then bid them leave us, that detain my message. Pan. Why, who detains thee? Din. Ask you that? A lassitude In all my limbs detains me. Pan. I perceive It has not seiz'd your tongue.â Din. No chariot could Out-strip me from the port; and all for you. Pan. And what good news? Din. Much better than your hopes. Pan. Then I'm aliveâ Din. And I am a dead man. This nasty lassitude drinks up my marrow. Gel. [aside.] What then am I?âThe marrow of whose guts Is eaten up with hunger? Pan. Met you one?â Din. Manyâ Pan. But any men? Din. Yes, several. But no such scoundrel as this fellow here. Gel. How's that?âI've suffer'd these affronts too long: But if you e'er provoke me thus againâ Din. You will be plaguy hungryâto be at me. Gel. I'll make you knowâthat you have spoke the truth. Din. Well, I would have all cleanâBring out your brooms; And a long reed, to eradicate the labours Of these same spiders, and their cursed webs.â I'll rout their looms. Gel. They'll catch their deaths with cold. Din. Think you they have but one coat to their back, Like you?âHere, take these brushesâ Gel. Well, I will. Din. I will scrub hereâGo you on t'other side. Gel. It shall be doneâ Din. One bring a pail of water. Gel. This fellow plays the Ãdile, and ne'er minds The suffrage of the people. [aside.] Din. Come, make haste. Sprinkle before the house, and paint the ground. Gel. I'll do't. Din. It ought to have been done before. Then next, I'll rout these spiders from the doors, And from the wallâ Gel. A mighty business sure! Pan. Neither know I what all this fuss is for; Unless some guests are coming. Din. Spread the couches. Gel. [aside.] The couches first for dinnerâThat looks well. Din. Some cleave the wood, others go gut the fish The careful fisherman brought here but now. [meaning himself. Toss down the gammon, and the bacon there. Gel. [aside.] The fellow, troth, talks sensibly enough. Pan. I fear you've little minded my directions. Din. I've minded them, and minded nothing else. Pan. Then say for what I sent you to the port. Din. I will thenâWhen you first dispatch'd me thither, Just as the sun-beams rose above the waves; No sooner had I ask'd the porters there, If there were any ships arriv'd from Asia, And they said, no, but I espied a bark, I think the largest that my eyes e'er saw. It made the port full sail; the wind, too, fair, Then all were asking whose the vessel was, And what on board; when, lo! I spy Epignomus Your husband, and his servant Stichus with him. Pan. Ha! What! Said you Epignomus? Gel. Your husbandâ The man by whom I live. Din. He's come, I say. Pan. And saw'st thou him himself? Din. I saw the man; With pleasure tooâHe has brought a power of gold And silver with him. Pan. That's good news indeed! Gel. Give me the brooms, and I'll go work in earnest. Din. Linen and purpleâ Gel. To keep warm my belly. Din. Couches of ivory giltâ Gel. Most royally Shall I lye down to supperâ Din. Pieces of tapestry, Rich Babylonian carpetsâand fine things. Gel. Well sped, by Herc'les! Din. Then, as I was saying, Singers, and artists both of wind and string, All miracles of beauty hath he brought. Gel. That's brave! Amusements, when I'm o'er my bottle; Then am I merriest. Din. Sweet ointments too, And of all sorts. Gel. I'll no more sell my jokesâ No auctions nowâI've an estate in fee. You puppies, that hunt auctions by the nose, Mischievous whelps, go hang yourselvesâO Hercules! I gratulate thee on th'increase of tenths. I vow'd to thee. Din. Then after all, came Parasites. Gel. Then I'm undone! Din. Such drolls were never seen! Gel. No! I'll return the dust I swept but now. Pan. Saw'st thou my sister's husband, Pamphilippus? Din. No. Pan. He's return'd? Din. 'Twas said, they came together. I hurried off to tell you the good news. Gel. I must e'en sell these jokes then after all; I thought to have kept themâAh! how will these rascals Sneer at my cost?âTho'Hercules indeed, Being a god, will come off well enough. Pan. In, in, Dinacium, give my servants orders, Prepare a sacrificeâFarewel, Gelasimusâ Gel. Can't I be helpful? Pan. I have slaves enough To spare.â [Exeunt Pan. and Din. Gel. Gelasimus, thou'rt finely fob'd. If one's not come, nor t'other, that's arriv'd, Will stand thy friendâI'll home, and search my books, Instruct me from the sayings of the best: For if I cannot beat these foreign fellows Out of the pit, I'm utterly undone. [Exit. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter EPIGNOMUS with a Musick-Girl, and STICHUS. EPIGNOMUS. To Neptune, and to all his tempests, thanks! For that I've had a safe and prosperous voyage, And am return'd in safety home again. To Mercury too, who aided me in traffick, And rais'd my stock fourfold, I give like thanks. Those whom I left in grief at my departure, I now shall meet at my return with joy. I saw my father Antipho but now, And found him, whom I left a foe, my friend. What will not money do?âSoon as he saw I was return'd in affluence, I wanted No mediator.âIn the very ship, Even upon deck, we were all friends again, And here he and my brother sup with me. Both yesterday were in one port together. To-day I'm somewhat sooner under sail. Stichus, conduct these people I have brought Into the houseâ Stich. Sir, should I speak or not?â The many hardships are to you well known, With which, I in your service have been sconc'd. One day from all my miseries, I'd fain, On my arrival give to Liberty. Epig. 'Tis just and rightâStichus, this day is thine; Go, spend it where you pleaseâI'm not your hinderance. I'll give you too a keg of good old wine. Stich. Excellent good!âTo-night I'll have my mistress. Epig. Ten, if you please, when at your own expence. Where do you sup to-night? Stich. Since you're so kind, I've here a mistress in the neighbourhood, Her name Stephanium, your brother's maid. I have invited her to sup with us At Sagarinus's, her fellow-servant. She's mistress to us both, so we are rivals. Epig. Conduct these inâTo you I give this day. Stich. And if I do not make the most of it, Say 'tis my faultâNow will I cross the garden, And see my lass I am to have to-night; Invite her to our supper, which I'll order To be got ready straight at Sagarinus'sâ Then for the market:âI'll be caterer. Wonder not, gentlemen, that slaves should have [to the spectators. Their invitations with their wench and bottle; It is allow'd at AthensâNow I think on't, ('Twill be less trouble.) We've a back-door here: (For they more use the back part of the house.) That way I'll go to purchase the provisions, And bring them by the same across the garden. It is a common passage to both houses. Follow me this wayâNow I'll make a day of it. [to the Musick-girl, &amp;c.] [Exit. SCENE II. Enter GELASIMUS. Gel. My books I have consulted, and am confident My fund of drollery will well secure My patron to myselfâNow I am looking When he returns from port, to sweeten him Upon his first arrivalâ Epig. Sure it is The Parasite Gelasimus I see. Gel. With lucky omens I came forth to-day: A weasel snatch'd a mouse up at my feet, And eat it at a mouthful in my sight. Thus as the weasel found to-day a dinner, I am in hopes I shallâThe omen speaks it. Behold Epignomus that's standing there: I'll go and speak to himâEpignomus, How glad am I to see you!âHow my tears Gush out for joy!âHave you enjoy'd your health? Epig. I have with careâ Gel. Why that's well said, and friendly. The gods be still propitious to your wants! I wish you health, Sir, to my heart and soul. You'll sup with me now on my first arrival? Epig. I am oblig'd to youâBut am promis'd forth. Gel. Give me your wordâ Epig. 'Tis fix'd. Gel. I prithee, do. Epig. 'Tis an agreementâ Gel. Troth, 'twill give me pleasure. Epig. I doubt not thatâWhen time shall serve, I'll come. Gel. The time serves nowâ Epig. By Pollux' temple! no. I cannot come. Gel. What hinders? Come,âI know You'll comeâYet,what at hand I have to give you I cannot sayâ Epig. Nay goâAnd for to-day Invite some other guest. Gel. You promise then? Epig. If it was possible,âI'd not refuse you. Gel. This I can promiseâNone shall be more welcome. Epig. Adieu! Gel. Is it resolv'd? Epig. It isâI sup At home. Gel. Since you'll not promise me this favour, Say, shall I sup with you? Epig. You should if possible; But I have nine to sup with me already. Gel. A fellow Iâyou may put any where. Epig. They are ambassadors, great men With powers plenipo'âand from Ambracia. Gel. Why then, let your ambassadors, great men Take place;âthe lowest of the low serves me. Epig. 'Twould not look well to mix you with ambassadors. Gel. Suppose I say, I'm an ambassador. Epig. NoâBut to-morrowâYou will find the scraps. Farewelâ [Exit. Gel. I'm a dead manâPlainâOut of doubtâ There's one man less by thee, Gelasimusâ I'll ne'er give credit to a weasel more. A most uncertain animal it is, And ever changing place ten times a day. Yet I could trust her with my life, my food. I am determin'd to convene my friends Upon this questionâHow to starve in formâ [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter ANTIPHO and PAMPHILIPPUS. ANTIPHO. As heaven shall save me, and continue long The blessing of my daughters, I rejoice To see your brother and yourself return'd In safety home, after your prosperous voyage. Pam. You've said enough; did I not know your friendship, Your goodness oft experienc'd heretofore, Gives credit to your wordsâ Ant. I'd ask you home To sup with me, but that your brother told me, When he invited me, you supp'd with him. It were indeed more proper, that you both Went home with me, and supp'd after your voyage, Than I with him:âBut that I'll not contendâ Nor think I mean to insinuate myselfâ But you and he, and both your wives, to-morrow Shall spend with meâ Pam. And the next day with me. He yesterday engag'd me for to-day. But are we, Antipho, well reconcil'd? Ant. Since, as I wish'd, you've thriven in the world, Peace, as 'tween friends it ought, be then between us, And intercourse.âFor let me tell you thisâ According as men thrive, their friends are true; Go their affairs to wreck, their friends sink with them.â Fortune finds friends.â Enter EPIGNOMUS. Epig. Well, I am now at home, And being so, one feels too great's the pleasure, When after absence, one finds all things well. My wife has ta'en such care of my affairs While I was absent, I've no doubt remains.â My brother Pamphilippus, with his father! Pam. Epignomus, how fares it? Epig. How with you? How long is't since you reach'd the port? Pam. Some time. Epig. What! and since that, all's calm 'tween him and you? Ant. Calm as the sea, which brought you both to shore. Epig. 'Tis of a piece, consistent with yourself. Shall we unlade to-day? Pam. Softly, good Sir, Better we lade ourselves with something good. How long to supper?âI've not din'd to-day. Epig. Go in with me, and bathe. Pam. I'll but step home, Just in, and thank the gods, and greet my wife. Epig. Your wife is coming hither, with her sister. Pam. That's well.âI shall go back the sooner then. I will be with you presentlyâ Ant. Stay and hear A story e're you go, you and your brother. Epig. With all my heart. Ant. Once on a time there was An old man, as I amâHe had two daughters, As I may have; and married to two brothers, As mine may be to you. Pam. I wonder how This story will turn out. [aside. Ant. The younger of them Brought a fine girl home with him from abroad, That sang and play'dâas you may now have done. The old man was a widower, as now I am. Pam. Proceed.âThe story seems to come in pat. [aside. Ant. When th'old man said to him who own'd the girl, As I may say to youâ Pam. Well, I attend, And hear you every word. Ant. I've given you My daughter for a bedfellow; and 'tis right You should provide a bedfellow for me. Pam. Now who says that?âIs it as you may say. Ant. 'Tis just as I may say to youâTake two, Returns the youngster, if one's not enough: If two be not sufficient, take two more. Pam. Who, Sir, I pray, speaks now?âHe, as 'twere I? Ant. He, as 'twere youâThe same.âThe old man then He, as 'twere I, an't please you, cries out, fourâ Provided that you pay me for their board, Else they will eat me up.â Pam. The old man sure Must be a stingy fellow to say that; To ask their board after so free an offer. Ant. The young man rather was a sneaking fellow, That could refuse, tho' ask'd, a grain of wheat. As he had given a portion for his daughter, 'Twas fit he should receive one with the girl. Pam. Methinks the young man acted with discretion, When he refus'd a portion for the girl. Ant. Th'old man would gladly have hook'd in a maintenance; But finding that impossible, he said He'd take her on such terms as he could have. Done! cried the youngsterâWell, done! cries the old oneâ Is it a bargain, one saysâ'Tis, says t'other. But I'll go in, congratulate my daughters, And after to the javelin, where I'll bathe, And cocker up my age. Then I'll await you After my bath, at ease upon my couch. [Exit. Pam. A curious fellow, this old Antipho! How workman-like he put his tale together! The rogue would fain be young againâBut he Shall have his bedfellow to keep him warm; I know no other use for one he has.â How fares our Parasite Gelasimus? Is he in health? Epig. I saw the rogue but now. Pam. How goes he on? Epig. Like one that is half starv'd. Pam. 'Tis pity that you ask'd him not to supper. Epig. It were ill luck to be a loser now At my arrivalâSee, speak of the wolf, And you may see his tailâThe prowling beast Is just upon youâ Pam. Shall we make sport with him? Epig. You speak my thoughtsâ SCENE II. Enter GELASIMUS. Gel. As I began to tell you, [to the spectators. Genteels, while I've been absent I've consulted My friends and my relations; who agree, I should e'en starve myself to death.âBut don't I see our Pamphilippus, with Epignomus His brother?â'Tis the manâI will salute him. My life, my joy, my Pamphilippus, welcome, My look'd for friend! welcome with safety home! Pam. Gelasimus, good dayâ Gel. You've had your health! Pam. I've ta'en good care of thatâ Gel. And I'm glad of it. I would I had a million at command. Epig. What would you do with it? Gel. Do!âI'd invite This gentleman to supâand leave you out. Epig. There you but speak against your interest. Gel. Then I'd invite you both. Epig. In troth I'd ask you willingly, but have not room. Gel. Invite me but, I'll make my part good standing. Epig. There's one thing may be doneâ Gel. Ay, prithee, what? Epig. Why, you may come when all the guests are gone. Gel. A plague upon you! Epig. You may wash with us, But markâI ask you not to sup. Gel. Confound you! What say you, Pamphilippus? Pam. I'm engag'd To sup abroadâ Gel. Abroad! Pam. Abroad, by Hercules! Gel. A mischief on you, sup from home so rir'd? Pam. How would you manage? Gel. Order one at home; Send word you cannot comeâ Pam. And sup alone? Gel. You shall not want for companyâAsk me. Pam. But I'm afraid my friend will take it ill, Who'as been at this expence on my account. Gel. With ease 'twill be excus'dâList then to me. Order a supper to be dress'd at homeâ Epig. What! disappoint his friend at such a time! No, not with my consentâ Gel. Will you be gone? Think you I do not see what you're about? Look to yourselfâ[to Pamphilippus.] He, like a hungry wolf, Gapes after your estateâThen, know you not, How men are set upon that walk by night? Pam. I'll have the more to meet and guard me home. Epig. He will not stir, not he, as you're so earnest To have him stay at homeâ Gel. Then order quickly This supper for yourself, your wife and me. By Hercules! you'll say I counsell'd right. Pam. With this same supper, I foresee, Gelasimus, You will go supperless to bed to-night. Gel. And will you go? Pam. The truth is, I sup here, Hard by, here, at my brother's. Gel. Certain so? Pam. Most certainâ Gel. May some stone then, as you go, Knock you o'th'head! Pam. No fear of thatâI go Over the garden, and ne'er see the street. Epig. Gelasimus, how dost? Gel. You entertain AmbassadorsâTake your ambassadorsâ Epig. Nay, 'tis your businessâ Gel. If 'tis mine, I'm readyâ Use me, invite meâ Epig. Yes, I think I've found One place where you may be accommodated. Pam. I think it may be done. Gel. My dear good man! Epig. If you could squeezeâ Gel. Close as a wedge, I warrant: Room for a kitten, there is room for me. Epig. I'll find some way or other.âCome alongâ Gel. What, this way?â Epig. Ay, to prison; where, I think, You'll not indulge your genius to the height. Come, brotherâ Pam. I'll but home, and thank the gods, And then be with you straight. Gel. And where shall Iâ Epig. To prison, as I said. Gel. If 'tis your will, I'll go ev'n thereâ Epig. Immortal gods! This fellow Would for a dinner or a supper's sake, Be gibbeted to-morrowâ Gel. That's my humour. I can encounter any thing but hunger. Pam. You will not with us then?âSir, your good fortune Hath long enough been pamper'd at my house. While you was Parasite-general to us both, We ruin'd our affairsâI would not now, After I've laugh'd at you, be made your butt. [Exeunt Pam. and Epig. Gel. What gone!âGelasimus, what resolution Can'st thou now take?âShalt thou!âCan I!âTo thee!â For me!âThou seest how dear provisions are! Thou seest benignity and human kindness, Where they both end!âThou seest too how buffoons Are set at nought, and ever their own fools. By Pollux' temple! no one soul shall see me Alive to-morrowâWell, I'll e'en go in. A rope about my neck shall be my portion; Which I should scarce have dar'd to venture on, But that the world should ne'er have wherewithal Maliciously to say, I died of hunger. [Exit.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter STICHUS. STICHUS. It is a common, but a foolish custom, In my opinion, if you expect a person, Still to look out for him: when, by Hercules! On that account, he comes no whit the faster. Thus am I looking out for Sagarinus, Who, for that reason, never mends his pace. 'Troth, if he comes not, I'll e'en take my place AloneâI will but fetch the keg of wine From home, and strait to supper;âfor the day, Like an old manâseems to decline apace. [Exit. SCENE II.

That's wellâThen follow me into the house. Sag. I followâ Sti. 'Tis my will, we drown all care This dayâLeave all external things behind youâ Now we're at AthensâFollow me, my ladâ Sag. I follow.âThis first setting off is rare, On my arrivalâGifts and omens good. SCENE III. Enter STEPHANIUM, from the house. Step. Spectators, let it not your wonder raise, That I, who live at that house, came out hence! The reason is, that I but now was sent for, Upon the news their husbands were expected By our two ladiesâWe all hurried thither To strew the couches, and see all things nice. But I found time not to neglect my friends, And got the supper dress'd here for my Stichus, And fellow-servantâStichus is our caterer. And for the cooking, I've a deputy. Now I'll be gone, and ready to receive My guestsâI see them comingâ SCENE IV. Enter SAGARINUS and STICHUS. Sag. You come forth, And bring our equipage alongâI make you [to Stichus. King of the kegâI am resolv'd our feast Shall be to-day, in all respects well order'd. As heaven shall save me! we shall sup politely, Here, in this placeâIt is our will and pleasure, Whoever passes joins our company. Sti. AgreedâSo every man bring his own wine, The tenths of Hercules will then be fuller; None but ourselves shall suffer for our feasting. Our supper's lonely, 'tis a sort of monotrophe, We wait upon ourselvesâ'Tis well enough For people of our rankâNuts, beans, and figs, A plate of olives, and a mess of lupines. Enough's a feastâIt best becomes us slaves To moderate our expence, than to exceedâ Each one according to his stationâThey Who're opulent, drink out of tankards, cups, And bowls:âOur little Samian jug serves us; And yet we live, and yet we cut our coat According to our cloth. Sag. Should we not settle On which side of our mistress each should sit? Sti. Be you aboveâYet, let me tell you, friend, I shall divide that with youâSay, which province You'll undertakeâ Sag. What do you mean by province? Sti. Choose you of Fontinalis to be lord, Or Bacchus?â Sag. O, of Bacchus to be sure. But whilst our mistress's tricking out and curling, Let us divert ourselves together.âI Appoint you master of the feast, my Stichus. Sti. A lucky thought!âBut 'twould become us more On a hard bench to sit like Cynicks, than To loll upon these couches. Sag. 'Tis rare luxuryâ But prithee tell me, master of the feast, Why stands the goblet here, nor pass about? How many cups are drank? Sti. Why, just as many, As you have fingers on your handâSo says The old Greek songâ Drink five cups, drink three cups, But never drink four. [singing.] Sag. Here's to thee then in twice five cupsâBe wise, And pledge meâI drink thus to all of usâ Here's to thee, here's to me, here's to my love, Stephaniumâ Sti. If you'll drink away then, drink. Sag. The cup shall never stand with me. Sti. I think A decent feast, were but our mistress here! Were she but come, there would be nothing wanting. Sag. Why that's well said.âHere's to you, boy, againâ You've wine?âO, for a dainty relisher!â Sti. If what is here don't please you, nothing will. Here, take some waterâ Sag. Stichus, you are right. None of your kickshawsâPiper, drink aboutâ Now mind your hitsâYou must drink this, by Hercules! What! do you flinch?âI must have no refusalâ You see what must be doneâAnd drink you shall. Look to your hits, I sayâNay, take this cup. The wine's not tax'd: You need not fear that here. Come take your pipes out of your mouth. Sti. When he Has drank his cup, mind you my rules, or else Be toast-master yourselfâI like not bumpers. We shall have nothing soon to drinkâBy Pollux! You'll turn the keg at this rate bottom upwards. Sag. What matters that?âTho' you've drank pretty deep, You are not cutâCome, Piper, when you've drank, To it againâCome, quick, puff out your cheeks Like any angry serpentâLet him, Stichus, That breaks the rules, be fin'd a cup of wine. Sti. A good law thatâAnd you shall have your will, Because you ask but rightâMind it yourself: For if you break it, I'll retain the forfeit. Sag. Why right again and justâ Sti. Here's to you thenâ And that's the firstâ'Tis droll enough to see Two rivals on such termsâDrink from one cup And kiss one wenchâ'Tis comical enough! I you, you I, both of one mind in that. Both love one wench.âWith me! why, she's with you: With you! with meâOne envies not the other. Sag. Enough, enoughâLet us have no ill omens. Now could I be as playful as a kitten. Say, shall we call her out?âAnd she shall dance. Sti. Agreed. Sag. My dear, my pretty one, my sweet Stephanium, come forth; come to your lovesâ You're fair enough for me. Sti. To me, most fair. Sag. Come, make us merry, as you always do With your good companyâWe're just come home, And long to see youâHoney, little Stephyâ If both be lovely in your eyes, your sweethearts, Come forthâ SCENE V. Enter STEPHANIUM. Step. Here, at your service, my dear ladsâ Now lovely Venus help me! I'd been with you Here long ago, but that I staid to trick Myself out for you.â'Tis our sex's way, That be a woman ne'er so clean and nice, And trim and dress'd, the work is never done. A courtezan shall by one sluttish act Easier offend, than please by all her neatness. Sag. Prettily said! Sti. And Venus spoke by her, My Sagarinusâ Sag. What's the matter, man? Sti. The pangs of love all over meâ Sag. All over? That's hard indeed! Steph. Where shall I place myself? Sag. Where'er you pleaseâ Step. Between you both, I think, For sure I love you both.â Sti. 'Tis over with me. My means are going all to wreck and ruin. I ne'er shall get my freedom by these doings. Step. Make room, my dears, that I may sit between you. Now this is as I likeâFor I would fain Be well with bothâ Sti. Then I'm undone indeed! Sag. What say'st then? Sti. What, indeed! Sag. Nay, by the gods! This day shall never pass without a dance. Come, honey; come, my sweetâGive us a dance, And I'll dance with thee. Sti. Now, by Pollux' temple! You shall not get the better of me there. I'll have a touch with her, as well as you. Step. Well, if I am to dance, you'll give the piper A cup of wineâ Sti. A cup too for ourselves. Sag. The piper firstâHere take itâAfterwards, When you have tip'd it off, as you were wont, We'll have a merry song, will make us itch Down to our little finger nailsâSome water here. Sag. Here, piper, take it offâBut now, your liquor Pleas'd not, it seems; now you can suck it inâ Here, take it, manâNow, while the piper's at it, Give me a kiss, you rogueâA rare whore's trick To give a friend a kiss just as he passes. What! tho' the piper boggled at his cup, It has not hurt him.âCome, now blow away. Sti. Ay, let's have something softâFor our old wine, Come give us a new tune. Sag. [dancing.] Where's your CinÃ¦dic Or your Ionic dancers can do that? If in this round you get the better of me, Challenge me at anotherâDance like thatâ Sti. Or you like this. [dancing.] Sag. O brave! Sti. O rare! Sag. O excellent! Sti. Enough!â Sag. Ay, one's as good as t'otherâI, I challenge your CinÃ¦dic's one and allâ No more to us than rain is to a mushroom. Come, let us inâWe've dusted it away, As long as our wine lasted.âYour applause, SpectatorsâAnd you may go home to supper. [Exeunt. The End of Conjugal Fidelity.</field>
