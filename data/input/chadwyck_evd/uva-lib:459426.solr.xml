      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. All Legions broke from Hell, all Fiends to day Task'd for to work on earth, and to obey Goetian spells, what starrs foretell the event Of hidden things, and future detriment, Earthquakes that shake us to believe and fear, Or more portentous spectacles ith' Air, All Circles drawn, Charms writ in Virgin-parchment Are here all turn'd to comfits and sweet Marchpent. You are welcoome Gallants to a merry Ghost, You know a playing one, his sign's on the poste, Rais'd by a waggish Scholar in the Town, Onely to affright a Citizens Breeches down: And give you all a caution on your lives, To get strong Points, but weak and gentle Wives. But if I linger, I shall be accessary To a murther here; and yet in faith I'm sorry; For 'bout those Breeches I have much to say; Sit still, and merrily feed on the Play; 'Tis City-chear, and stead of Wine pray laugh, And with your money we your healths will quaff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Octavian and Babilas, they fight. Octavian falls, then exit Babilas. Enter Frier. The early star hath chear'd the chanting Cock And taught his wings to be the Countrey Clock, The chirping Birds salute him with their notes, Tuning his welcome in their warbling throats, The gloing Marigold with other flowers Prepare their scents to dress the sun-fresh Bowers: The windes soft whistlings bluster 'gainst the Trees, Saluting Titan with the humming Bees; All these adore thy beauty, I alone Admire thee but for meditation. Spies Octavian's body. Hah! has the Moon to night wept bloudy tears? A wounded man! Saints shield me from all fears. Who is't? Disguised too? I know the cause For dread of the Edict and our strict Laws 'Gainst Duels now proclam'd. My charity Shall give his body burial by me. Rash men when on false honour wings they fly Exit with Octavian's body. Out-glide their path, and thus to ruine hie. Enter Pinnario and Procus. Pin. Procus well met thou art going to the Wedding: Give me thy hand, thou art bobb'd as well as I. Pro. Yes faith, thank Cupid and my own neglect. Since I have left Coaches, and poudring of my hair, And took delight to trace the populous streets In my huge Boots, red Cloak, and my long Sword: She never lookt on me, Pox on all Base affectation and practising big looks, 'Tas quite undone me, and thrust my Mistrisses eys out Enter Valerio. Here's t'other Fisher that has mist the Eel too. Good day Valerio. Val. Like to the transform'd Procus. Pin. That's no where but in's looks, now trust me Sir. Pro. Well, this Octavian has cozen'd all o'us: Prithee let's study something for revenge. Pin. But not ith' military way. Pro. O fie, hang it. Val. A baudy song, and Procus shall bear the burthen. Pin. Faith, now you talk of a baudy song, my Rivals, What think you of a Randevous to night At fat Erotia's the Curtezans. Pro. How soon my thoughts are back on by the Devil. Why I was musing what to do to cool me, For my conceit of happiness in Aureliaâ Well, thank my temper, and the Edict come forth 'Gainst Duels, blith Pinnerio, thou hadst else; For being Rival to my lust and Mistris, Been earth by this. But to the Whore agen. Pin. I thought thy anger would end in such a trifle. Val. But is she cheap and tractable my Lads. Pro. Troth that's a question too. Who has any money? Pox on lac'd handkerchiefs, and amorous Rings, They have begger'd me. Pin. And broke thy very Purse-strings, With hiring paltry Poets to make their Poses. Pro. Still Fiend dost vex me? Pin. O the Wench, the Wench. Pro. I prethee pardon me, I had forgot the Doxy. Pin. Faith, then Ile tell you, for money, Gentlemen, Ile give my word and promise for your credits. Pro. O my dear Idol. Val. Nay pox, hinder him. Pin. Then my Bladesâbut you shall keep it secret. Pro. May we turn Eunuchs if we do not, and never Piss when people look on us for modesty. Pin. Why then a Maid, a Virgin, a fresh Rose, A sticking Paracelsa. Pro. Who who, nay who? Pin. Quish like a Codling Procus in thy arms. Pro. Nay, nay, dear Idol, prithee who is it? Val. Pish, thou art so tyrannical, Pinnario. Pin. Marry, a Fox-glove Lads of my presenting: A handsom Lass that wanted means and money; Whom I commiserating did prefer To Erotias handling, and I know by this Is taught to tumble with dexterity, Enter Philarchus and his Servant. Look, look, our other Rival, old Philarchus. Phi. Stint, stint your pace, you Rascal, you Plodd on As if I went to my Aurelia's bed. Pro. Vengeance oth' stone, and weather-beating Collick, Before she cheated the old Sponge, hee'd wriggle, And throw his Gout-bound Legs a mile before us; Nay, kiss his rough Lips smooth upon her hands Ere we could overtake him. Slight can't you see? Justles him. Phi. Catarrhs consume thee, justle an old man. Val. An old man, and going to be married? Pin. Aged, and get a Maidenhead to night? Phi. I must give way, there is no striving here. Enter Frier. Pin. The Frier! what makes he here? Fr. To all good morrow. Pro. Dee hear my Ghostly Father, may I dispence, Aside to the Frier. And for all my yesternights Confession Stew out that heat Aurelia's love hath kindled. Fr. What means my Son? Pro. A wench, a wench, my Father. Fr. Away. Pro. Why good Father? Fr. O poor Octavian! Pro. Why, what of him? he is not married yet! We that were his Rivals mean to present him With a Song. Fr. Alas, alas, he's slain. Om. Who, who? Pro. Mum, mum, good Frier, mum, say nothing. Pox of all whores and meetings. Sweet Aurelia. Exit. Phi. Father, you sigh, who is't I pray is slain? Fr. The Bridegroom Sir, and by Aurelia's brother. Val. My dear friend Babilas, who told you this. Ser. I Sir, who saw young Babilas this morning With frowning looks come to my Masters Chamber, And call him forth, since when I never saw him. Val. Where found the Frier Octovian? Fr. Walking abroad To taste the sweetness of the mornings air, Hard by my Cell I found his breathless body. I took him up, and from him now am come To acquaint his father with the heavy news. Benedicite. Exit Frier. Pin. Nay then Aurelia, have at thee once agen. Exit. Val. Valerio thou art unhappy to thy friend, Babilas coveting his sister for me Thought to make way by young Octavians death, Which he has now perform'd. What shall I do? Aurelia for her brothers sake will hate me, She knows he lov'd me dearly. Well, Ile in too, And win Aurelia, or finde out Babilas. Exit. Phi. Hold, hold my sides, O I shall burst, hold, hold. O constant thrift, that never leaves that man Who honours thee. Aurelia's father's mine, He always wisht his daughter to my bed; And though her amorous tears prevail'd with him For young Octavian, yet when he hears he's dead, He will replant me in Aurelia's heart. Yes, jeer and flout me my young Rivals, do, You'l finde at last, th' old Fox has cozen'd you. Exit. Enter Senio, Procus, Pinnario, Valerio. Omnes. Nay Senio, noble Senio, let me finde favour. Senio. This rudeness Gentlemen becomes you not, Pray give me leave that my Indulgency. May chuse one for my Daughter, not your claimours. Pro. If I am not the handsom'st Ile be hang, And lik'st Octavian Pox o' my oregrown Boots. Pin. Nay, she is mine that's certain, I heard her swear once. Next to Octavian she admired me. Enter Philarchus. Phi. Many fair years crown the most honour'd Senio. Sen. Most Grave Philarchus. I, here's a man indeed! Who wears sobriety upon his looks. Whom thrift has worm'd so well, that he will last When all these Grashoppers are shrunk to nothing, I wish Aurelia his, and none but his. Phi. I am sorry for your sadness. Sen. I Philarchus. This 'tis to love for handsomness and honour: Had she chose you, she might have smil'd, not wept. Phi. That yet may be perform'd if you consent. Sen. She is to full of grief and will not hear. Phi. Shee'l not deny her Father for duty sake. Besides, behold how many gaping Wolves Grin with false hopes of her retired favour, Whom if she has, she's begger'd and undone, I am sure, and can in the rough Winters want, Pave all my path with Gold. Your Wedding dinner Is now prepar'd, and a full Table met. Cosin, not all our expectations: Sen. Enough, I am resolved. My noble friends, I do perceive you all do emulate Each others fortune. Speak, are you content To let me chuse a Bridegroom for my Daughter. Omnes. And hear it with delight and willingness. Sen. Then before all these, as witness of my gift, I here consent and freely do give up My Daughter to the thrifty Grave Philarchus. Val. Philarchus. Pin. That humming Drone. Pro. That rotten Medler. Sen. Nay Gallants, repine not, 'twas your consent, Nor shall yea yet discourteously return Without some recompence, we therefore both Intreat your company would honour as At the Wedding dinner, which I intend this day. Phi. Shall we expect you Om. Yes with all our hearts. Pro. These damned Boots, Aurelia had been mine else. Exeunt. Enter Fryer, Rogat, Senio, Aurelia, Engin. Fr. What comfort Daughter, come, you must forget Old grief, and dress your Maiden smiles agen In Amorous blushes, to embrace Philarchus Aur. Is he the man then? Fr. Such is your Fathers pleasure. Aur. You Frier contracted me and my Octavian. Fr. Yes, that all these can witness, I did contract ye. Sen. But now sweet Girl, my onely joy and comfort (Since Babilas is gone) thou art alone My staff to lean on in my drooping age, Oh do not slide away and make me fall In grief as well as years, but give consent.â Aur. To marry old Philarchus, I consent And would 'twere done to night, within this hour. Rog. Can you so soon forget my lost Octavian, And bury all your love in's grave with him? Sen. Sir, you must pardon me, you are too busie! Your Son is dead, and your interest lost there: She's still my Daughter, and shall prosecute What I command, or else disclaim her Father. Rog. Forgive me Sir, my grief alas did move me, My grief for two lost Sons. Pro. Two Sons! why my friend, and the mad Rogue Dauphine, Your young heir now, is not departed too? Rog. He is indeed departed, for when he heard Of my Octavians death, and by whose hand, This day he left my house, and vows to search The flying Babilas throughout the world, In the revenge of his unhappy brother. Pin. Good fortune after him, 'tis a valiant witty Rogue: Sen. Hah, whose that stalks and figures on the ground As if he conjur'd and invok'd the spirits? Aur. Pray be not angry on my wedding day Sir, It is my servant, preferr'd by a noble friend, And with such commendations and applause, That I must begg you'd please to entertain him. Sen. Well I consent, come hither. What's thy name? En. Engin, Sir, Sen. For water or for fire? En. When you command for both. Sen. Discreetly answered. A new device comes in my head. Heark Engin. Some few hours hence meet me ith' Gallerie, I have some Items to acquaint thee with. En. With duty and observance Ile attend you. Sen. Ha's a good thriving promising face believe me: You'l not be wanting. Rog. You must excuse me Sir, My dead Sons body is to morrow interr'd, I must contrive a little Ceremony. Sen. We may remember you in a Bowl of Wine. Rog. With my true thanks. Sen. And our Confessour.â Come my Aurelia. Honourable Rogat. Exeunt. Frier. Thus the world goes hurrying on Till wonders come ne're thought upon. He who sleeps to night, ere day Death inrobes with weeds of clay, 'Tis a steddy tottering state Propt with Love and shook with hate. Like that I now am musing on to be Relator of a joyfull Tragedy. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundus ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Senio, Philarchus, Engin. Sen. For look thee Engin, should her coy denial Be once resisted by thy diligence, And old Philarchus aided by thy power. Phi. She fears if she consent not willingly, Wee'l force her to my bed. Sen. You hit me right, But I will not drown your sweet insuing pleasures With more supposed fears. Engin the light A long night and a happy to my Son. Exit. Phi. Could I but blow away these humble Bees, Time should deferr my wisht delights no longer. Oh, these court Blazers buz about my ears And kill my heart, with poison'd jealousie. Nay by this light wee'l wait you to your Chamber. Within. Phi. Hoida, a morris dance, and she the jester. Enter Pinnario, Procus, Valerio, Aurelia. Pin. Thank you for that, not see you in your Chamber: Yes, and there leave you with a kiss sweet Bride. Dost here if thou lov'st me, kick him out o'th bed And wriggle into his breeches. Aur. You are merry Sir. Pro. Then Venus may'st thou rule thy crooked Vulcan, And let a Childe of Mars rewhet this sword, Upon thy smooth and Alabaster breast. Phi. My good gay friends, is it not sleeping times. Pin. Not yet with you these two hours Sir, I take it. Pro. Two hours, has this drie weather-beaten Kix Substance and strength to suck this Sugar Cane Two hours, two minutes, and those coughing ones. Phi. And yet these wrinckles put down your smooth faces. Pin. Thank the dim eys that made the election. En. Gentlemen, pray remember where you are, And who you speak to: 'tis Auralia's husband: A Grave experience, thrifty Citizen; And one that (by your favours) she is pleas'd Without compulsion to smile upon.

Enter Philarchus. As stealing out o' th' Closet. Phi. Softly, softly, thus far I am crept unheard: If I but once escape your tallons Rooks Ile wash, and rub, and scrub you too for this. First, (let me see) Ile call her Father hither, Then raise the Citie, all France too if I could: Then to the Frier, hee'l make 'um confess all.â Oh, I shall cough, I am undon, oh, oh, This bur will choak me if I hoakt not up. Engin looks out of his bed. Hum, hum, uh, uh, uh. En. 'Tis he, Philarchus. Phi. Uh, uh, uh, uh. En. Ile rise and terrifie him on a suddain, He enters like a Ghost. This sheet will dress me rarely like a Ghost. Whose that disturbs this silent Room with coughs, Or dares break ope his barred doors to walk, Philarchus trembles. And trace the path of the departed Spirits? Phi. The Devil haunts her too, what shall I do? En. Be silent and to bed, and never more Disturb the pleasures of this sleeping pair. Phi. Oh no, I will not, what's thy name good Devil? En. I am the spirit of slain Octavian, Oh, I could tear thee in pieces, to think that thou Durst think on that Aurelia with lust Which was once mine, continue thy obedience, For if thou dost betray her, I will haunt thee, And with pale apparitions vex thy soul. Depart to bed, thy cold hug, not Aurelia. Exit Ghost. Phi. Good Devil I am gone, how shall I do I have forgot my way, befriend me darkness, He gropes in the dark and goes to Aurelias bed instead of his own. This way the closet lies I think. Uh, uh. Au. Who's there, Philarchus. Phi. Uh, uh, uh, uh. Au. Oh, that my shield-bearer could hear me now, Ide make him ease the tickling of your throat, His bed is not so far, but he may hear me. Phi.

He calls me wife, call him up shield-bearer. Enter Engin with the breeches on a Pole. Phi. Oh I shall shake to powder, I confess all. En. Without premeditation quickly, come. Phi. I meant this night to steal away and leave you, Then raise old Senio, the Frier, Rogat, And to conduct 'um hither to be witness.â En. Of what, speak villain? Phi. Of my imprisonment andâ Au. Oh Dotard betray his Lady and Empress, the breeches. En. Here Amazon. Phi. Dear Imperiours wife take heed. She attempts to put on the breeches. If you do wear 'um you are quite undone, Las, I was cur'd of the dry scab last moon. Au. Well, hang 'um on the pole agen, but heark you, If you agen conjecture any escape, Or let your frowns discover inward anger, Ile hang 'um here, here on thy horns deviser. Phi. Oh misery, of a handsom wife, my forehead. Au. Well Ile to sleep agen, watch you the Ferret. Exit. Phi. Engin, come hither. En. Your will Sir, what's your will. Phi. Hast thou indeed: lain with my wife to night And don the feat for me? Nay, Shield-bearer. En. Speak softly Sir, if my Amason should hear you, You are lost for ever. Phi. Why, what's the matter? En. Softly, you heard us strugling in the night. Phi. Oh yes, the bed did reel against my forehead. En. Well you may think I am false, but 'tis well you spoke not. Phi. Why, what, what projects, honest Engine tell me? En. Why, some fears she had that you'd discover us, Which made her even this night intend to gueld you, And then to swear she found you impotent, I used what exhortations I could In pitie to your members, and at last prevail'd Something Octavians Ghost has told her since: You had best take heed Sir, for he tells her all things. Phi. The Devils Cuckold, die, die Philarchus. En. Oh the sweet kisses she hung upon my lips, When I had put Philarchus from her thoughts. That barren piece of Earth where furrows are plow'd That stubble fit for nothing but to burn. Phi. So, now I am going the way of thriving Citizens. En. Then with a thousand passages of Love tricks. Phi. No more, no more, my lust begins to boil. En. Why, I can help you Sir to cool't agen, So you'l not grumble at what we possess. Phi. One boon, and all is thine, my wife and all. En. On that condition any thing, come tell me. Phi. Beauty has wrought so on my flexid nature, And so increased the flame I would suppress. En. Oh, you'd evacuate, is that all Sir, Phi. Some simple harmless wench, thou knowst 'um all Though of thy instruction, I shall not weaken her much. En. Why now Philarchus speaks himself a man, And will conform himself unto the times, His vizard is fallen off, and he's become A smooth young striker, active, full of spirit, His knees grow straight, his staff with fury flies him For fear of being arreign'd for killing those His fatall hand shall threaten, his shoulders shrink Into his marrowy back, his eys fill up.â Phi. No more good Engin, I am worse than Goat already, En. Then for his wisdom an Isocrates. He knows his wife (since she is young and handsom) Must have her longings, but then hee'l have his too: And whilst she sports at home, hee'l rut abroad: For should he say his wife does Cuckold him, The Town would jear him into age agen: Besides: the proofs and confirmations, The Lawyers Fees, with the Attorneys bribes, Would rip his bags up, shoal away his Gold, Undo his thrift, and cancel all his Bonds. Phi. True, Engin, true. VVhy, thou shalt have a stipend From all rich Citizens to be maintain'd; That I should study to accuse thee Engin, VVho thus hast sav'd my honour and estate. Get me but wenches, and I vow nere more To think upon Aurelia but as thine. En. For should you mutter the disgrace is yours. Pin. Thou hast instructed elegantly before. En. As soon as day expect one in the Closet; Your wife with men, and why not you with women? Phi. Ile bite thy ear thou Rascal, I will bite it. En. Youl spoil your better bit Sir. Softly, softly. Exit Phi. My mouth waters at your bed. Aurelia, Pox on these tempting curtesies. O that I could Un-gentleman my self and break my trust: But should I do so? Incest and faith together VVould lie so heavy on me, 'twould make me hang An-arse, and then like hunting of the Hare VVith un-breath'd Dogs, 'twill be but petty sport. Exit Engin. Enter Rogat and Frier. Ro. VVere't possible I could wish all were present. Fr. It will be requisit, but how which way? Ro. The way must be my invitation To my sons funeral. How thinks my Father? Fr. I think it reasonable, but then prepare VVhat ornaments are fitting for the Hearse; VVe must use order in this undertaking; About it noble Rogat, the sun begins To shew his rays and you have much to do. Exit Rogat. Frier. Prepare we for Confession, And our souls absolution, VVhat a world of horrid acts, Heinous crimes, and bloudy facts, VVhispering evils, secret thoughts, Inward fears, and outward faults, Big-mouth'd oaths, invented Lyes, Bitter Curses, envious Cries, Shall this mornings night produce, VVhilest I pardon Heavens abuse. But some Delinquents will so blindly run, They'l knock their brains out 'gainst Confession.</field>

Hold noble just Octavian, I obey you. Er. And me to Giblets, Ile chip you into Mommocks else. Phi. So, so, Aurelia's cruelty in her too. Dau. Heark brother, pause a little; I have now A happy occasion to advance my fortune: You know I have but a small Annuity, But all had been mine, had I not sav'd your life, By acting Engin for you. Oct. Thou hast so nobly freed me from my fears That I am onely poor in thanking thee, Command what ere thou wilt. Dau. Heark then. You see Philarchus is so frighted So asham'd, and fearfull of what you may discover, That he'l do any thing so you be secret. Faith, add one more command, and let it be To settle on me two hundred pounds a year, And then th'ast nobly recompenc'd thy brother; I have a Bond here of twenty thousand pound Ready ingrost to tie him to his promise. Oct. 'Tis done, Ile warrant thee. Stay I recant, Shall I be good to thee, conceal thy faults, Marry thee to a fit wife, and all this To thee my Enemy, yet reap no benefit? Phi. What a poor doting fool can give, receive. Oct. Then on my brother Dauphine engage to settle Two hundred pounds a year, no words, but presently Seal to perform it, else by my revengeâ Phi. No big words, if you have mercy, what shall I do? Two hundred pound, though dearer than my bloud, Yet cheap enough to save my Reputation. I do consent, give me the Bond, Ile seal. Dau. Father and Gentlemen your hands to witness. Rog. To what my son? Dau. A trifling thing call'd two hundred pounds a year Philarchus here is bound to settle on me. Ro. How's that? My hand and blessing too. Pro. A lucky Rogue, and yet wears no great Boots. Phi. I deliver you this as my Act and Deed. Seals. Dau. Why, so, this is a blessed end of Usury, To purchase Land to bestow on younger brothers. May all rich Citizens observe thy charity. Sen. Octavian as I rejoyce to see Thy forgotten dust resume a shape agen, So I lament the deprivation Of Aurelia from thee and all men else. Oct. How's this? Sen. Alas, she's married to Philarchus. Fr. Hold Senio, and hear the Frier speak, And from his words gather the union Of these so long divorced pair of Lovers. Walking abroad to taste the morning sweetness A goary track of bloud made me a path To the unwelcome place, where wounds lay gasping Of a slain body, ghastly, stiff, disguiz'd For fear of the Edict then new proclam'd: I rais'd his body with my aged arms, Bore him to be interr'd within my Cell, But searching his wounds, and pulling off his Vizard, (With pale fear daunted) I beheld his face, Which me thought was colour'd with some hope of life; In short such bounty Heaven lent my pains, That with my Art I soon recall'd again His shrinking spirits. But he whose onely life Was hid and cherisht in Aurelia's bosom Bursts out loud cries for his Aurelia, And that he fear'd, if 's death were but suspected Her father then would force her to Philarchus: All comforts I administred were loathsom, Unless Ide sweeten them with his Aurelia: I found this grief was desperate, which made me Send in all haste to Rogat and Aurelia, And to be certain, and add joy to health, (And with consent of Rogat and Aurelia,) By my holy Order made them Man and Wife. Se. But why so long did you conceal the Marriage? Fr. Hearing Philarchus was the selected man, And doubting least Octavians wounds might prove Still mortal, and that Senio would not hazard (On that account) his daughter to Octavian, And that Philarchus Gold and solid outside Should tempt and cozen you, grave Senio, To give your daughter up to him she hated, And on a fathers curse wed whom she abhorr'd. (Asham'd to see an old man dote in love) 'Twas our invention, Dauphine thus disguiz'd Should fright and terrefie Philarchus, Unto a true confession of himself. Se. Why, then you married Aurelia and Octavian? Fr. I did. Se. And your pretence of Dauphines hot pursuit In search of Babilas, was but suppos'd, That so he might act Engin unsuspected. Ro. It was indeed. Se. My blessing, my blessing on you both. Oct. Now may I call thee twice mine bright Aurelia. Fr. Pinnario though young Octavians friend, You have done ill, and grosly have betraid In this poor wench even innocence it self, It will agree with our conformity, If you create Cunicula your wife. Pin. Troth now I am up, and for Octavians sake: Dost hear Cunicula, after variety Of bed-fellows, will one content thee? Ha? Cun. Yes, and my prayers for this conversion. Fr. How is my Cell blest? Pro. Nay, since all's lost, Ile to my Boots agen. Oct. Now to you Babilas, whose fortune 'twas To glory in my conquest, let me tell thee, Dauphine has fetcht mine honour back again From thy friends bosom, and if you repine Again, I dare thee to a second fight. Ba. No more contention unless it be in friendship: Happy Octavian I beg thy love and pardon. Oct. Thou hast um back. Henceforth for ever friends. Val. Was Babilas the cause then of our quarrel? Dau. He was. Ba. Valerio and Dauphine then agree too. Fr. Ile mediate betwixt um: give me your hands, Because in my opinion all are quit, For what Octavian lost by Babilas In Valerio's bloud was recompenc'd by Dauphine, What Valerio suffer'd was before maintain'd By the hand of Babilas. By the love and honour For which you fought for, I command you: Receive each others friendships to your bosoms. Dau. With my souls best power. Embrace. Val. With joy and gladness. Dau. Pinnario and Procus I ask your pardon. 'Twas for my brothers Mistris I us'd you thus. When you have a Mistris each of you command, Both of us how or in what form you please. Pro. And by my great Boots thou wilt act it rarely. Well. Since 'twas for a handsom Lass, Dauphine, And on condition of the like assistance For me, when I shall need thee. Let's embrace. Pin. On the same terms then let us all embrace. Here all imbrace. Om. For ever real, hearty and true Friends. Se. To make this union stronger, let me entreat You all would honour my poor house this night, And taste a supper season'd with your welcom. Omnes. We all consent. Frier. Take then thy fair one in thy arms, And Saints protect ye from all harms; Pinnario with Cunicula, Philarchus with Erotia, Valerio, Babilas, and Procus, they Shall be the Bridemen of this day; Dauphine with his new purchase then The rare alms of a Citizen; Wise Rogat with grave Senio, And last my self the Frier too. All to my Chappel then away To those delights which shew the day. Thus flourish shall the just, and still increase, Till death them crown with everlasting peace. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Tis done without Amen, or superstition, Popes Bull, or the Committees inquisition: What think ye now of Plays? Abominable: Or is't'cause you want wit to unfold a Fable, Pick out the Allegory, drive the sense Where the Plot aims it: that your benevolence Should clap us, and our mouths up. Confess, confess; You would be something, and 'gainst Plays you press, To be prickt down as States-men, not because You do conceive um hurtfull, but will make Laws, To undo the Gallants pastime of the Land: Beats down because you cannot understand. Slow Readers, look upon the Roman State, Whose high built frame the stars durst emulate, And look as far as they. Ask Livie there, How many worthies grac'd her Theatre: They whose civility hath nurst us all; Thought um most holy, stil'd um Tragical, From their Gods Sacrifices. And must we, Whose pollish'd Scene purg'd from obscenity By Poets flaming fancies, whose bright rays Consume scurrility, and fix the Bays With us to fan profaness, drive away Light chaff, that in pure colours, Scenes display. When plots work high with contradictions fill'd, Amazing you, how are they reconcil'd? Must we I say be censur'd? Why 'tis your nature To gaze at new things, adore the fashions altar. No, more resist your own opinions. We Will dress our Scenes with various novelty, And teach you wit enough for eighteen pence Above the reach of the Common Councils sense. Try and persever, if you finde this true, Silence your errours, and we are quit with you. FINIS.</field>
