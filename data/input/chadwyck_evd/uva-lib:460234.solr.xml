      <field name="fulltext">TO MRS. POPE,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Extract from St. Palaye's Memoirs of Ancient Chivalry. Part III. After the battle of Poitiers, more than an hundred thousand peasants resolved to extirpate the nobility, ravaged their estates, burned their houses, and without distinction of age or sex, treated all of that order whom they could seize with the most brutal and savage barbarity The Duchess of Normandy, the Duchess of Orleans, and three hundred ladies, married and single, were at Meaux with the Duke of Orleans. Several detachments of this furious rabble, joined by others from Paris and its environs, thought themselves certain of dividing this prey. The inhabitants had opened the gates, and in conjunction with the rebels had reduced the ladies to the necessity of intrenching themselves in a place called Le Marché de Meaux, a post separated from the rest of the town by the river Marne. The danger was extreme. There was no excess of brutality which might not be expected from these unbridled hordes. The Count de Foix, and the Captal de Buche, John de Grielly, Captal de Buche, was a general under the Black Prince. He was one of the first knights at the institution of the Order of the Garter. To him was intrusted the command of that body of troops, which falling on the flank of the second line of the French army, decided the fate of the battle of Poitiers. He was so attached to the Prince of Wales, that on hearing of his death, he refused all nourishment, and followed him to the grave. who during this event were returning from the Prussian crusade, heard of their distress at Chalons. Though with a very inconsiderable force, they immediately resolved to join the small party who defended the fortress of Meaux. The honour of the ladies neither suffered the Count de Foix to reflect on the danger, or the Captal de Buche to remember that he was an Englishman. He eagerly availed himself of the liberty which a truce between France and England afforded him, of following sentiments more sacred in the breast of a knight than national animosity. They threw themselves into the place, where our brave knights and their followers had no other apparent resource than inevitable death, nor any other rampart to oppose to the rebels than the banners of the Duke of Orleans and the Count de Foix, and the pennon of the Captal de Buche. They ordered the gates to be opened, and marched resolutely against the enemy. At this sight the insurgents were seized with terror, the knights cut through their broken ranks, killed seven thousand, and returned triumphant to the ladies.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, SPOKEN BY MR. MIDDLETON. To-night a tale of England's earlier days, From ancient records drawn, our scene displays; Where gen'rous courage taught the warrior's breast To spread the buckler o'er a foe distress'd; And the bold knights of Edward's gallant train, Victors on Creci's and on Poitiers' plain, In the defence of Gallia's chiefs engage, To save a gentle train from lawless rage, Wipe the soft tear from weeping beauty's eye, In danger dreadful, mild in victory. Nor these exploits in flattery's mirror shown, From our own partial annals drawn alone, For Gallia's grateful page records the name Of heroes that adorn'd her rival's fame. But, ah! our doubtful bard, with trembling hand, The outline fills, that truth historic plann'd; And as he tries amid the battle's strife To blend the feelings of domestic life, His hopes with anxious expectation wait Your just decision on his drama's fate; With eye abash'd, he views this dangerous place, Witness of many a vent'rous bard's disgrace; While an illustrious few, by genius crown'd, Rising undaunted from this fatal ground, To radiant glory's proudest heights aspire, And damp the ardour of his feebler fire: Yet as his drama British mercy shows, His only hope from British candour flows; And if you give his scene one generous tear, If his faint hopes one favouring plaudit cheer, He on your suffrage rests his dubious claim, Whose censure's candid, but whose praise is fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. Scene. Meaux. Enter St. Pol, and Clermont. St. Pol. Are the guards placed?— Cler. They are.—The wearied soldier, Tho' toil and constant watching waste his strength, Shrinks not from duty, nor complains of service Enforc'd by common danger,—even the coward Is valiant in a war where none are spar'd, And safety must alone depend on conquest. St. Pol. We need their utmost efforts.—Stung with madness, The furious populace have vow'd our ruin,— Our total extirpation. Cler. Danger threatens On every side—victorious Edward spreads O'er half our conquer'd provinces his sway; While, with internal poison, cruel faction Unnerves the arm that should oppose his force. St. Pol. Dangers like these might surely overcome All other cares.—Yet in this bosom, Clermont, 'Mid all the host of terrors that surround us, My soul is tortur'd by the struggling passions Of jealousy and love.—Matilda's heart, Due to my vows, due to my long attachment To Orleans' noble house, is ravished from me;— Is basely won by Douglas' artful flattery, That Caledonian stripling.— Cler. Let not rage Transport you thus—Have you forgot Poitiers?— Where,—as our fainting squadrons measur'd back Their ground in swift retreat, your courser, wounded, Threw you amid the foe; in vain your friends, (Nor did I idle stand) rush'd on to save you; The furious tide of battle bore us back;— Then gallant Douglas with a whirlwind's fury Drove through the thickening crowd, and brought you off. St. Pol. Recall not my dishonour!—Would to Heaven The English archers had transfix'd my bosom Ere I had so been rescued—now he stands My evil genius; builds his fame, his fortunes, On my disgrace, and fair Matilda's love Rewards him for the service. Cler. O, for honour's, For virtue's sake, rein in this fiery passion! Let not dissension or mistrust invade Our councils now, when every nerve exerted, Even to its utmost strength, is weak to guard us, Or stop the progress of these ruffians' fury.— Behold the Duke.— Enter Duke of Orleans, and Officers. Duke. Dumain, haste to the citadel, Bid them be vigilant, and let the cross-bows Greet all who dare approach the walls.—Clermont, I charge you, with assiduous eye observe The citizens—I much suspect their faith.— Dubois, I fear, betrays us. St. Pol. Then why doubt A moment to secure him?—Let me go. This sword shall stop his treason. Duke. Gallant warrior, Restrain your eager violence—be that Our last resort.—Clermont, attend the council, And watch with care the actions of Dubois. Cler. My Lord, I shall. [Exit. Duke. O my St. Pol, to thee I will unfold my bosom—Though I wear The smile of confidence upon my face, Despair has chill'd my heart;—too well you know The fury that pervades the savage host That now invests us,—o'er our ravag'd country Already like a deluge have they spread, Marking their course with ruin. Age and sex Meet no distinction; rank and beauty only Enflame their cruelty. The pious fathers Are butcher'd at the altar; smiling infancy, And the hoar locks of venerable age, Awaken no remorse;—our cities blaze, Our churches are profan'd, our castles raz'd, Nothing escapes their sword; and, much I fear, Assaulted from without, betray'd within, Our feeble efforts will not stem the torrent.— The traitorous citizens but wait the word To ope their gates. St. Pol. Why, let the ruffians come, Join'd by their treach'rous friends.—Have we not seen Our squadrons scatter'd by a foe we scorn'd, Our nobles slaughter'd, and our king a captive? And shall we fear to die—to perish bravely Amidst our country's ruins? Duke. Fear to die— Is that a soldier's thought?—Is death the object That chills my soul with terror?—Look around, See the chaste matrons, and the trembling virgins, That on our swords depend, the only hopes To save their honour, and their lives from villains Who pride themselves in cruelty, who build Their fame on brutal insult, and esteem Ferocity and lust as social virtues.— I must remember claims dearer than life; I am a husband, and I am a father.— St. Pol, I have a daughter. St. Pol. That's a thought To give me tenfold ardour.—Never can That sword be vanquish'd which is drawn for her.— O noble Orleans, pardon the rash heat That has betray'd my bosom's dearest secret, A passion which aspires perhaps too proudly To such a glorious prize. Duke. 'Tis not the time, When desolation waves her vulture wing Terrific o'er our heads, when fear and horror With giant stride stalk o'er our ruin'd country, To form connubial ties—or soothe our minds With scenes of joy, while these fell blood hounds hunt us Into the toils of fate. St. Pol. Then let us turn With lion rage, and daunt our bold pursuers.— Matilda, may my arm protect thy beauty, And win thy smiles! I ask no other glory. [Exit. Enter Douglas. Duke. What hopes, my valiant friend? Doug. Our only safety Arises from despair—who hopes no more Loses the sense of danger. By a soldier, Who 'scap'd the vigilance of the besiegers, I learn that, as he past, a flying crowd Of trembling wretches, who on every side 'Scap'd from the vengeance of this horde of robbers, Declar'd a band of English warriors, led By Lord de Buche, were marching hitherward. Duke. Why, let them come; the more our foes, the nobler Will be our death.—To sink beneath the swords Of these our open enemies, who oft Have met us bravely in the storm of battle, Will grace our fall with glory. Doug. Is the truce With England yet expir'd? Duke. It is not. Doug. Then You need not fear their arms.—Though oft their leaders With hostile inroad waste my country's borders; Though now our vanquish'd monarch is their prisoner, While proudly they aspire to lord it o'er us;— I still must own them generous:—public faith Has ever mark'd their councils. Duke. May we find Their present conduct justify your praise.— I know them brave, and strict to their engagements; Yet prompt to tumult, and when chaf'd, as rough As the rude element that girds their shores.— And now I fear their heady rage will burst With force unusual.—At the sound of freedom, Their passions always swell with high impatience; Will they not join these ruffians, who pretend To fight beneath her banners, and assume Her sacred name to sanctify their outrage? Doug. This is your country's error,—still confounding Freedom with anarchy,—knowing no medium Between the wild extreme of savage license, And abject slavery.—Though we are foes, From the same Saxon origin with England (Our mountaineers excepted) we derive Our lineage, and our laws. If stern oppression, Or tyrant insolence invade their rights, Each British nation burns with patriot warmth, And spurns the yoke indignant.—Let but once Insulted liberty her ensigns wave; From Thule's rocks to Vecta's chalky bourn Our island pours her manly inmates forth; Not rude and frantic, but resolv'd and firm, Like warlike Sparta's daring sons of old, Calm though incens'd, and disciplin'd though free. But when a patriot monarch rules, like him Who now is placed on England's throne, all powerful In deeds of mercy only; and not more By law than inclination turn'd from ill, Their loyalty, unbounded as their freedom, Asserts his rights, and glories in obedience. Duke. You plead their cause with warmth,—yet with our armies Still are your chiefs inroll'd, and war with France Has always been the signal of invasion To Scotland's sons. Doug. 'Tis so,—the rival nations ever look Invidious on each other,—and we watch Our powerful neighbour with a jealous eye. Yet I ne'er see our adverse squadrons join, But it appears as if a brother arm'd Against a brother:—and my fancy forms Some happier era, when the sister kingdoms, Not join'd by conquest, but by league connected, Shall own one monarch, feel one common interest. The independent nations thus united “Were confident against the world in arms.”— Pardon my warmth. Duke. I honour the free spirit Your kindling accents breathe. O valiant Scot! Dearly you pay for aiding France.—Poitiers Beheld your gallant band o'erthrown, or scatter'd, While, shut within these walls, you're doom'd, I fear, To fall beneath a more inglorious foe. Doug. I cannot perish in a nobler cause Than the defence of beauty and of virtue. Alarm without. Enter an Officer. Officer. Arm! arm! my lord. The foe's increasing numbers Press on the eastern gate.—The soldiers waver,— And in the streets men of suspicious aspect In crowds assemble. Duke. Douglas, instant lead Your warriors to the gate.—Myself will haste And watch these coward traitors, who would join The mad incursion of yon rude assassins. [Exeunt. Loud alarm. Enter Duchess of Orleans, and Matilda. Duch. What dreadful sounds are these? Matilda. Despair and horror Sit on each brow—I fear our hopes are lost, And instant fate awaits us. Duch. Powerful Heaven, Extend thy mercy to us!—let thy arm Strengthen our feeble host.—From the dire horrors That must await our overthrow, the mind Turns in dismay, nor dares imagination Portray the dreadful scene! Matilda. Your words have frozen The tide of life within me.—What resource— Ah, whither can we fly?— Duch. We cannot fly— Death is our only refuge.—O, my child! Nothing but death can save us from such outrage As sickening nature shudders even to think of. Matilda. Protect us, gracious powers!—the noise approaches. Alarm and shout. Enter Douglas. Duch. What mean these martial shouts, this rising tumult? Does the fierce foe prevail? Doug. Our happy arms Have check'd awhile his rage. Duch. My prayers are heard.— O noble Douglas! in this glorious conflict Thy generous efforts have been crown'd with conquest; Accept my thanks,—accept a mother's thanks.— Come, my Matilda, let us meet your father, Meet him once more in liberty and safety. [Exit Duchess, Matilda is following her. Doug. Matilda! dost thou fly me? Matilda. What,—Lord Douglas? Doug. Ah! why that formal voice,—that cold regard?— There have been hours when my Matilda spoke In kinder accents to her faithful Douglas. Matilda. How can the bosom swell with tender thoughts, Or love's mild radiance play around the brow, When fear and sorrow prey upon the heart?— We are encircled by the snares of death.— O, Douglas!— Doug. Lovely maid, too much I feel Our dreadful situation. Thus to see thee Defenceless, and expos'd to death and insult.— Ah! we must part.— Matilda. No,—we will die together!— This is no time for cold dissimulation. Vanish, those female arts!—I here declare— Declare to Heaven and thee, I feel no wish Beyond thy safety, nor will e'er survive thee. Death in thy arms is bliss, and life without thee, But scenes of misery. Doug. O heavenly kindness!— Then fortune, I defy thee.—This embrace, The seal of mutual tenderness, has placed me Beyond the reach of fate.—In these dear arms I mock his feeble power. [Trumpet.] 'Tis past,—the dream, The transitory dream of love and joy, And I awake to horror.—That rude summoner Calls me to sterner duties, and reminds me Of our impending danger.—O, Matilda! Danger involving thee, my soul's best treasure.— One sad embrace.—Farewell. [Exit. Enter St. Pol. St. Pol. That favour'd boy, Thus always crosses me.—Divine Matilda.— Ah, do not shun me thus.—Must still those eyes, Which beam benevolence on all besides, Chill me alone with frowns?— Matilda. Cease, cease to urge me; Look round, my lord—behold my father bow'd By sorrow's iron hand, my weeping mother, Myself, and my unhappy friends, abandon'd To unavailing woe,—to every terror Impending death, in its most frightful shape, Can stamp upon the mind:—then ask your heart If such are scenes for love. St. Pol. Yes, by my honour, For love's imperial triumph.—In the hours Of peace and safety love is often feign'd, The mere parade of words, a compliment Paid with unmeaning voice; but when surrounded By fear and misery, his votaries shew Their ardour unabated, truth records Each vow that passion breathes.—Yet, if you doubt The truth of my assertion, ask young Douglas. Matilda. Lord Douglas? St. Pol. Yes.—I saw the aspiring boy This instant leave you,—his persuasive vows Have found a kinder saint.—But let your favourite Beware my just resentment. Matilda. Sir, 'tis well.— Perhaps the Duke of Orleans will not thank you For schooling thus his daughter.—Am I bound To bend my heart to your command, or regulate, By your advice, my conduct? This demeanour Suits more a peasant's roughness, than the courtesy Of Gallia's polish'd knights. [Exit. St. Pol. Refused with scorn?— With mark'd disdain?—her haughty father too, Though 'neath the specious semblance of esteem, My suit eluded with the same pretence.— Why should I thus devote myself to ruin, For those who pay the service of my sword With keen contempt, and foul ingratitude? Soft,—let me think,—'tis so;—my band shall join With fierce Dubois, whose discontented spirit Is hostile to the nobles, and but waits The signal of revolt.—When next the foe Assails the ill-guarded town, our force united, Falling with unexpected rage upon them, Shall daunt the garrison.—Then Douglas, then This arm shall set me free from hate and jealousy, And strike at once for vengeance, and for love. Enter Clermont. Cler. The chiefs are now in council, and the Duke Has sent me—ha! what means that ruffled brow?— You seem disturb'd. St. Pol. Nothing.—I only weigh Our present danger. Cler. This to me, St. Pol?— I know that daring bosom ne'er was shaken By sense of danger.—Something deeper lies.— Why hide thy wrongs from me?— St. Pol. Because from thee They cannot find relief.—I pray, forbear To wound me further by thy vain inquiries. Cler. Yet surely, to a friend.— St. Pol. Clermont, that friend Who with officious zeal attempts to fathom The secret purpose that my soul would hide, Acts to me like a foe,—then try no longer To probe the latent wound that festers here. [Exit. Clermont alone. Some insult has enflam'd his eager spirit. Valiant he is, and noble,—but in anger Sudden and deadly as the lightning's flash. Surely no start of passion can induce him To hurt the general cause.—He must be watch'd While this short frenzy lasts, till recollection Shall bring him back to reason, and to duty. [Exit. Enter Dubois, and Citizens. Dubois. Curse on your heartless band, ye coward traitors! Who, bold in council, talk o'er deeds of glory, But shrink from honour when allied to danger. Had ye behaved like men, these haughty towers Had bow'd to freemen. 1 Citizen. Say, what could we do? Dubois. Do!—while the fiery Scot with headlong fury Rush'd on the assailants, had your timid band Charg'd on his rear, he must have been destroy'd. But doubtful and amaz'd ye trembling stood In dumb dismay.— 1 Citizen. The Duke's pervading eye Watch'd with apparent jealousy our movements. Dubois. What should appal you at the sight of Orleans? His eye at once subdued your servile spirit.— Ye should have borne him down, and let your swords Have drunk his spouting blood. 1 Citizen. Forbear,—forbear. Behold St. Pol. Enter St. Pol. Dubois. This sudden interruption Betrays suspicion. St. Pol. 'Tis the traitor's lot Ever to live in fear.— Dubois. Traitor?— St. Pol. Yes,—traitor.— Think not your private meetings are conceal'd From our inquiring eyes.—But send away This listening train. I have a few short words For your sole ear.— Dubois. My friends depart. [Exeunt Citizens.] Now, sir, I wait your orders. St. Pol. Know, you are discover'd, Your deep-laid treasons all disclos'd, and when The foe assaults us next, my orders are To watch you, and your friends, and if ye waver, To mark ye for destruction.—Do you start?— You have a friend before you.—I have suffer'd Indignity from Orleans, and have vow'd Severe revenge.—If you have courage now To aid me, speak.—If not, my sword shall seal The secret in your heart. Dubois. Did I not scorn That threat of arrogance, I were unfit To share your confidence. St. Pol. Then mark my words.— The next attack, when all are close engag'd, My troops shall join your friends, admit the foe, And aid the glowing scene of desolation.— For this I only claim the sole disposal Of Douglas and Matilda. Dubois. I embrace The manly offer, and accept your succour. Enter a Citizen, who gives a letter to Dubois. And see, the fates urge on the glorious deed. Within this hour a fierce attack will shake This city's towers;—on every side destruction Shall flame against its walls. St. Pol. Enough!—remember As the event of this day shall determine, We're doom'd as traitors, or renown'd as heroes. Each to his charge,—and act like men resolv'd To live or die for freedom, and for glory. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. Scene. The Citadel. Long and loud alarm. Shouts. Enter Duke of Orleans, Clermont, Officers, and Soldiers. Duke. The fatal die is cast—impetuous rage, Aided by treason, has prevail'd.—The foes Possess the city, and these straiten'd walls Are now our only barrier.—Tell me, Clermont— And yet I fear to ask—What has been sav'd Of this most precious wreck?—my wife is here; But oh! Matilda— Cler. Sir, I grieve to tell The mournful tale.—When with insidious arm St. Pol the assailants join'd, and our press'd troops Surrounded, turn'd to flight—at that dread moment Lord Douglas and myself, with the few soldiers We could assemble, hasten'd to the palace; As thence we guarded to the citadel The trembling race of beauty, sudden on us St. Pol impetuous rush'd: our dauntless band Withstood his fury; and retreating slowly, Brought to the fort the Duchess and her train. Would I could add no more!—but as brave Douglas, His buckler o'er your lovely daughter thrown, Cut through the press, a blow full on his helm Brought him to earth.—Regardless of herself The fair Matilda rush'd amid the crowd And threw herself beside him;—at the instant Fresh troops arriv'd, and we were forc'd to leave them. Duke. And would you leave them? Cler. Say, what could we do?— Scarcely our force suffic'd to bear away Our trembling charge, and rescue for a time, Ah short that time, I fear, the hapless victims From brutal insult. Duke. O! how that distracts me— What is Matilda's fate?—The thought is horror! O come, my friends, and let us sally forth, Save her from death, or perish in the conflict. What, do ye hang your heads, and shrink from danger? Then I will go alone. Cler. O wrong us not— We are not slow or cold in beauty's cause. But should we thus rush out to certain death, We throw away the last remain of hope, And cannot aid your daughter.—I will go Alone, disguis'd, and if I 'scape the guard, The friendship of St. Pol, whose former honours This day's foul deed has sullied, will protect me. So shall I learn, at least, Matilda's fate.— Be calm, my lord—I may bring comfort to you. Duke. Go, and may fortune aid you.—Grief will catch Even at the slightest ray of consolation That hope, delusive, throws.—But oh, my wife!— How shall I meet her look?—yet I must seek her; Conceal in smiles the anguish of my soul, And give her confidence I cannot feel. [Exeunt. Scene. Meaux. Dubois alone. Thus far we have prevail'd—the city owns No other lords but us. Nor can the castle Hold long against our arms.—Yet what is conquest, Unless we reap its fruits? The splendid domes, The costly furniture, the hoarded wealth, Of these luxurious nobles must reward The victor's toil.—Yet if the headstrong herd Give once the rein to rapine, all will sink In rude confusion;—and licentious plunder Will ruin, not enjoy.—But how restrain Their giddy violence? And this proud renegade; Whose sword assisted our bold enterprize Must here claim no pre-eminence, nor think To gain the brightest prize, the fair Matilda, Whose powerful charms are dearer in my eyes Than all this city's treasures.— Enter Laroche. Are the people Intent still on their duty? Lar. Yes,—but yet I fear their vigilance will soon relax; Already I perceive they view the wealth That lies on every side with eager eyes.— One word alone by rash impatience breathed, May be a signal for the general plunder. Dub. How shall we guide those we have call'd our equals? Go, and alarm them with the fear of danger. That will have stronger influence o'er their minds Than all our praise of discipline and order. Remind them that the citadel is strong, And full of soldiers train'd to war and blood, Stung by disgrace, and frantic with despair;— And should they find us careless, one bold sally May waste at once the harvest of our conquest. Where are the troops that join'd us with St. Pol; Are they inclin'd to us? Lar. I have sounded them, And find the greatest part dispos'd to act As we direct. Dub. Those whom you hold as doubtful Must be secur'd—I like not these deserters. He who betrays his friends, will ne'er be faithful To foes whom he has hated and despis'd. St. Pol I much distrust. Let then a troop Of chosen citizens,—men whom you know Are steady in our cause, await my call Before the palace. [Exit Laroche. Shall this recreant lord, The engine of my purpose, think to seize The fairest trophy of this day of triumph, Matilda's heavenly charms?— He has obtain'd revenge, glutted his malice With ruin of his foes.—The spoils of beauty Are due to him who led the conquering force Of voluntary heroes—not the traitor, Whose wiles seduc'd a mercenary band To quit their leaders.—Yes, she shall be mine, Spite of his noble birth and bold pretensions. [Exit. Enter Douglas and Matilda guarded. Doug. These servile fetters that confine my arm, To me were dearer than the proudest trophies Of chivalry, while my Matilda's charms Cheer the sad scene, and gild the gloom of bondage, Did not reflection point thy hapless fate With mine united.—Then despair and anguish Add tenfold horror to the pangs I feel, And death itself, the only refuge left me, Is cloth'd indeed with terrors!— Matilda. O my Douglas, Why would no friendly arrow in the battle Pierce both our hearts?—Then we had fall'n together, And been in death united.—That sad solace We yet may claim.—No,—I will ne'er survive thee.— Doug. O matchless proof of tenderness and love, Which charms at once, and kills me! Enter St. Pol. St. Pol. [Speaking to an Officer.] Let your care Keep special guard before these gates. [To Matilda.] Now, madam, Your insults are repaid.—The scorn'd St. Pol May now, perhaps, be heard.— Matilda. And canst thou deem me then so sunk, so abject, So lost to every sense of virtuous pride, As now to listen to thee, thus debas'd By treachery?—My heart could never stoop To feign affection which it did not feel, Or feed the hopes of unrequited passion With the mean flattery of dissembled kindness.— But while St. Pol was friend to fame and honour, The pride of war, the bulwark of his country, His merits claim'd my reverence: I respected His worth and glory, though I could not love him. But now— St. Pol. Spare thy reproaches.—I expected Nought but disdain, and heed no more thy anger; But this thy minion soon shall feel my vengeance. Doug. And I am arm'd to meet it, base apostate. St. Pol. Apostate?— Doug. Yes—disgrace to faith and knighthood. A mean betrayer of thy friends and country.— Think on the noble train of virtuous beauty Now shut within yon castle's walls,—but which Thy new allies must conquer. Even in thought The horrid scene contemplate, and thyself The guilty cause, and if thou canst survive it— Frown not on me, but turn thy haughty looks On those who fear them; I as much despise Thy impotence of rage, as when I stood On Poitiers' bloody plain, while, as my shield Hung o'er thy prostrate head, my active sword Beat back destruction from thee. St. Pol. Hell and furies!— Shall I stand by, and hear thy braggart tongue Insult me thus?— Matilda. Oh, do not rashly urge His fiery temper.—Hear me, brave St. Pol, And let not passion's fury thus impel thee To arm the cruel hand of rage against us. We now are in thy power—the wretched victims Of thy ill-judging vengeance.—Turn not hence Thine eye;—I will be heard,—thou may'st destroy us As thou hast done thy country,—but with us Thou must destroy thy fame.—Look on that youth— St. Pol. And dost thou bid me look Upon my hated, and my favour'd rival,— And bid me let him live?— Matilda. Yes,—live thy friend.— Rivals in love or glory, still the brave Strive for pre-eminence by deeds of honour, And emulation only leads to virtue. Who envies, owns superior worth;—who pays Service with base ingratitude, betrays A coward's caution. St. Pol. Ha! a coward's?— Matilda. Yes; And therefore cannot harbour in thy bosom.— Will brave St. Pol suffer his heart to foster Ingratitude and envy?—Do not frown, Or think I would insult thee,—do these prayers, These tears, these streaming tears, appear like insult?— For pity, hear me.— Doug. Waste not prayers on him.— I would not purchase life by one soft tear, One plaintive sigh of thine. [To St. Pol.] And dost thou think, Misguided man, our fate depends on thee?— True, thou may'st kill us,—but to give us freedom, To heal thy country's wounds, and to restore That honour thou hast tarnish'd, now is plac'd Beyond thy feeble reach;—for when thy sword Aided this band of ruffians, it became Their instrument, not thine; thyself the servant Of their black deeds.—Canst thou believe these slaves, Who insolently tread on all distinctions, Which time has sanctified, or virtue given; Will, after they have us'd thy power to ruin, Thy noble friends, treat thee with aught but scorn? Noise without.] Give back—you cannot enter here.— Dubois. [without.] Who dares Oppose my way?—Assist me, citizens, And teach these haughty slaves to know their lords. Enter Dubois, and armed Citizens. St. Pol. What means this interruption?—Is this well?— Dubois, retire, or— Dubois. What, do you presume To dictate here? St. Pol. Avoid the place this instant, Or, base-born slave, this arm at once shall vindicate My violated honour. Dubois. Dost thou talk Of violated honour?—and to me?— Go to the citadel, and join the remnant Of thy abandon'd friends,—there rate thy slaves; We owe thee no obedience.—Wealth and power, The glare of splendour, and the charms of beauty, Are his whose daring arm has strength to seize them.— Matilda is my prize, and thus I claim her.— Doug. Villain, and slave!—O that my arm were free!— Dubois. Take that rash boy, and bear him to the dungeon, There let him to the dreary walls complain, And vent his empty threats. Doug. Now see, St. Pol, The fruit of thy vindictive rage, and learn For whom thou wert a traitor.—Ruffians, lead me Where'er your malice prompts you.—Villain, know These limbs will bear unmov'd the keenest tortures Thy malice can inflict.—I would not feel The secret pangs that gnaw thy canker'd heart For the world's empire.—O! my lov'd Matilda! My bosom bleeds for thee.—All gracious Heaven! Protect her life, and guard her innocence From the dread fury of that monster's passion. Matilda. Farewell! farewell! my Douglas! [Exit Douglas guarded. Dubois. Force her off. Matilda. O heavens! to what new horrors am I doom'd. St. Pol. Unhand her, savage ruffians.—Then my sword Shall do me justice.— [They force Matilda off. St. Pol draws, and runs at Dubois, but is disarmed. St. Pol alone. Coward, coward arm, That fails my purpose.—Hell-hounds! robbers! slaves!— Curse on your vile designs!—O, madness! madness!— Whom should I curse?—my own degenerate soul, That, for the short-liv'd frenzy of revenge, Has sold a life of glory and of honour.— Has stain'd my name, undone my friends and country; Has sacrific'd the idol of my wishes To the rude insults of a ruthless villain.— Why stand I tamely thus?—The arm that wounded My bleeding honour, shall avenge its wrong.— But how?—disarm'd and baffled—even depriv'd Of means to kill myself.—O villain! villain!— Self-punish'd, self-condemn'd. [Throws himself on the ground. Enter Clermont. Cler. St. Pol.— St. Pol. St. Pol?— Who calls that hated name?— Cler. A friend. St. Pol. Then fly This fatal place, and leave me to despair— But I have not a friend—this traitorous arm Has burst the bands of friendship and affection. My Clermont, turn thine eyes away in pity. Cler. I come to lead thee back once more to virtue. I've learn'd what fate awaits the wretched captives, Earl Douglas, and Matilda. St. Pol. Name them not. The dreadful thought harrows my soul with terror. [Rising.] O, by the memory of our past friendship; If my vile deeds have not so deeply sunk me In your esteem, that even you will refuse me This last request—a death at least of honour;— Lend me thy sword, or plunge it in my bosom. Cler. For shame, shake off this weakness; and redeem, By manly daring, the unhappy wrongs Your madness has inflicted.—Let the coward, Who fears to own his error, basely seek To shroud his guilt in death:—the truely brave. Will live to wipe away the foul disgrace Of temporary crimes by acts of virtue, To heal the wounds his frenzy gave.—You ask The service of my sword;—it shall be yours, If you'll employ it to preserve your country. St. Pol. Give it me quick—By injur'd France I swear, This arm shall do her justice.—I will join, With my repentant troops, the gallant train Pent in the castle's walls, and hurl confusion On fierce Dubois and his abandon'd rabble. Cler. Vain is that thought.—Your followers are disarm'd, Or by the foe seduc'd;—one only way Remains to save us. St. Pol. Name it, quickly name it; And swifter than the driving rack is forc'd Before the raging storm, I fly to execute The glorious enterprize. Cler. Say, do you mean Really to save your country, or to waste Your frenzy's rage in rash and vain attempts, Devoid of real service? St. Pol. Why that question? Cler. Because the arm of headlong indignation May plunge the dagger in a breast unguarded; But he who plans a deed of serious import Must act with coolness. Well I know the ardour That animates your passions.—France, alas, Weeps it in tears of blood. St. Pol. Spare that reproach— I feel it here, it preys upon my soul.— But how can temperate courage aid us now, When nothing slower than a bolt from heaven Can extricate our friends?— Cler. Mistake me not.— I do not counsel coldness or delay, The time, Heaven knows, demands dispatch and daring; But swift in action, weigh the means of action With anxious caution. St. Pol. Haste, and shew those means.— Cler. Then mark me.—From the Prussian borders, where Beneath the banner of the cross they fought, The Lord de Buche leads back his gallant train Of English warriors. St. Pol. What de Buche—the friend Of England's gallant prince? he whose wing'd arm On that destructive day when Poitiers' field Blush'd with the blood of Gallia's bravest nobles, When long the battle hung in doubtful balance, First turn'd the scale, and lead his English squadrons Triumphant o'er our numbers—Will he join His force with ours, and aid his enemies? Cler. Those who like him, and his brave countrymen, Face countless odds in glory's bold career, Ne'er see a foe in the oppress'd.—A truce Now bids the fiery storm of battle cease Between the rival nations.—Haste to seek This generous soldier.—As the scouts inform us, He now is near this city, on his march To join his fellow leaders.—Leave these walls, Ere stern Dubois arrest your flight—the fame Of your revolt from Orleans' Duke, affords you A passage through the peasant host.—I own The attempt is hazardous, the event is doubtful; But doubt and hazard are of little import, When fear is danger, and despair is safety.— What says St. Pol?— St. Pol. I'll on the instant try it.— Yes, Douglas, yes, I will repay the life Your valour gave, or perish in the attempt. And, fair Matilda, though you scorn'd my love, I'll yet deserve your friendship; and the tears My passion caus'd, my penitence shall dry.— O flatterer hope—alas! the dire effects Of my wild rage are certain; my remorse May be too late to aid you.—Come, my Clermont, And speed me on my way;—then to the citadel And cheer our friends with some faint rays of safety. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene. The Citadel. Enter Duke and Duchess of Orleans, and Attendants. Duch. Undone, undone, my lov'd my lost Matilda; What dost thou suffer now?—perhaps beyond What even my fears can picture.— Duke. Do not thus Give way to useless sorrow. Duch. That's the sting That tortures me.—I know my tears are useless— I know they flow in vain—I know they cannot Restore my murder'd child. Duke. Recall your firmness— Bear up against the conflict—am not I A parent too? Duch. You are—you are a father.— You cannot feel the agonizing pangs That tear a mother's breast.—A thousand cares, A thousand tender offices, which, trifling In wisdom's eye—touch every finer spring Of fondness and of love, crowd on my memory, Once my soul's dearest joy, now its despair, And fill my breast with woe unutterable.— Those arms which oft around my neck were thrown In playful tenderness, are gall'd by chains; That breast, the soft abode of filial kindness, Now pours, perhaps, the gushing tide of life.— Yet you're a parent.—Had I been a man, I would have rush'd on swords and pointed spears— This bosom should have stream'd one bleeding wound Ere thus abandon her.— Duke. O dry those tears— What could I do—hemm'd in by warring thousands, Compell'd by duty to consult the safety Of those given to my charge,—to guard thee too. Duch. Perish such duty! perish too my safety! Can I survive my daughter's death, or, worse, Her foul dishonour—for this public duty, 'Tis a fine word ambition has invented To cheat mankind, to skreen its selfish views Beneath the specious mask of patriot zeal, And blunt the feelings of humanity. But he whose stubborn breast is steel'd against The social charities of love and friendship, Whatever knaves pretend, or fools believe, Can never love his country. Duke. Peace, and hear me. Duch. I will not, cannot.— O, I am deaf to every sound but sorrow's!— Matilda! O, my child! my bleeding daughter! [Exit. Duke. Follow, and try to calm her griefs,—my presence Would but distract her more.—This is too much. The storm of grief too hardly beats upon me, And I must give it way.—If yet 'twere possible To save the wretched remnant that are shelter'd Within these walls, I would at least endeavour Still to endure this weight of woe that whelms me; But since all hope is vanish'd,—better perish In an attempt, however rash, to save My wretched child, than basely linger here, And wait the foe's approach.—To arms, my friends! And follow me.—Sound instruments of war!— Who knows what desperation may accomplish Against their numbers?—Or, if we must die, At least we'll fall like men. [He is going out, Clermont meets him. Cler. What means this haste? Duke. I go where duty, and where vengeance call; I go to glory.— Cler. Rather say to death— Inglorious death. Duke. Death cannot be inglorious In such a cause. Cler. He who throws off his life, When to preserve it may preserve his country, Acts both a coward's and a traitor's part.— Look from these towers, and see the numerous foe Covers the plain, what can our scanty force Expect in open conflict?—Here, perhaps, We may awhile resist their furious efforts, Till succours shall arrive. Duke. But, oh! my daughter!— Cler. How can we free her?—If our lives could do it, I would not damp your ardour, but be first To urge the bold attempt; nor sleeps a sword Within a soldier's scabbard, but would flame In the stern front of battle:—Now our rashness Could but precipitate her fate.—St. Pol, Waken'd by insult to a sense of honour, Has left the town, and seeks the troops of England. If not as friends, they may afford us aid As conquerors; but if we madly thus Rush on destruction, all the lovely train That now these towers protect, become the prey Of an enrag'd, ungovern'd multitude, Flush'd with success, and insolent in triumph; Their passions heated by the recent conflict, The dread of future vengeance lost in conquest, And emulous in deeds of guilt and slaughter. Duke. You have prevail'd. I will submit awhile To bear the heavy load of life, and wait, With patience wait, high Heaven's mysterious will.— My friends, be vigilant—guard well the walls; And should the foe attempt to scale the fortress, Repel them steadily; or if o'erborne By crowding multitudes,—yet let them purchase A mournful triumph by the death of thousands, Not boast an easy, or a bloodless conquest. [Exeunt. Scene. Meaux. Dubois alone. I was to blame in leaving thus St. Pol.— His haughty spirit will not brook controul. He may repent his treason, and attempt Something against our power.—Who waits?— Enter Laroche. Laroche, Make haste, and with some chosen friends secure The rash St. Pol,—I fear his fiery temper May urge him to an act of desperation. Lar. You speak too late;—for at the western port, That leads towards Paris, I beheld him pass; He told the guard he went by your command On matters of importance. Dubois. Be it so.— He might have here been dangerous; but the country Is friendly to our interests.—All the nobles Are scatter'd, or in exile.—The few soldiers Who 'scap'd Poitiers, are either on our side, Or by our force o'eraw'd.—The captive king Convey'd to England.—We have nought to fear From his escape.—But see, the fair Matilda Approaches.—Leave me. [Exit Laroche. Enter Matilda. Still in tears?— Matilda. The wretched Have surely leave to weep. Dubois. I am not skill'd In courtly arts,—I have not learn'd to flatter The wayward fancy of capricious beauty; Nor need I learn the whining lover's tone To one within my power:—yet, charming maid, I will forego the rights that conquest gives me, And lead you to the altar. Matilda. Awful powers! Who watch o'er innocence, protect me! Dubois. Speak.— Matilda. How can I speak?—I am not free to choose, A wretched prisoner here.— Dubois. Be witness, Heaven! I do not wish to violate your voice.— Bless me by kind compliance; you shall see The meanest slave pays not more abject duty To his stern lord, than you shall claim from me. Matilda. Duty from thee?— From thee, my country's ruin? Hence! away! Nor haunt me more with thy detested suit, Abhorrent to my soul, which I reject With as determin'd firmness, thus encompass'd With thy successful snares, as if I stood Now in a monarch's court, with Gallia's nobles Contending for my smiles.— Dubois. This moves my scorn; And do you think I build my happiness On the weak basis of a woman's will?— 'Tis true, I wish'd to win you to compliance By mild entreaty; but since gentler means I find are vain,—and your obdurate soul Is obstinately fix'd,—deaf to my vows, I will produce an advocate to plead My ardent passion, and perhaps his words May have superior influence. [Dubois makes a sign, the scene opens, and discovers Douglas bound, and an executioner by him. Matilda. Mercy! mercy! My Douglas doom'd to die? Doug. Be calm, my love— My death is nothing,—'tis thy fate destroys me. Dubois. Now, madam, give me hopes,—reward my passion, Or Douglas dies before you. Matilda. O, my soul!— My agitated soul!—What can I do?— How shall I act?— Doug. Act as becomes your birth,— As noble Orleans' daughter.—Scorn the ruffian, And his insulting menace.—Blest my death, If it could free you from his hideous passion. Dubois. Be quick—determine,—for his idle ravings, They nor awake my anger nor my pity;— His fate depends on you—no hesitation,— Your answer.—Have I hopes? Matilda. [pausing, and looking at Douglas.] Ah,—No!— Dubois. Dispatch then.— Matilda. Barbarian, stay!—Revoke that bloody mandate!— Behold me at your feet.—Oh, spare him!—spare him! Dub. Either this moment to the altar with me, Or instant death awaits him.—nor shalt thou Escape my fury—I'll no longer court thee, Nor kneel a suppliant where I can command. Matilda. O horror! horror! Doug. Monster!—coward monster! Curse on these chains—O that my struggling heart Could burst these bonds, and drag him down with me To death and misery—off villains, murderers! Dub. Kill him, I say, this instant. Matilda. [Running to Doug.] Hold assasins— Or let your cruel hands destroy us both.— Part—part us not—oh let us die together. Dub. Tear them asunder. Matilda. No—I will not quit him. Ah! barbarous cruel men.—Despair! despair! [As they are forcing them apart, loud alarm and shouts. Enter St. Pol and English Soldiers. St. Pol kills Dubois. The Citizens are driven off.] Matilda. O miracle of joy! St. Pol. They live! they live!— All gracious Heaven, accept my fervent thanks— Free that brave warrior. [The Soldiers unbind Douglas. Doug. O St. Pol! this act— St. Pol. Enough of courtesy. Though now surpris'd, The ruffians are not vanquish'd—and our friends Are few, though nobly daring.— Doug. Lead, St. Pol— I will not linger in the course of glory.— [Exeunt St. Pol and Soldiers, Douglas is following. Matilda. And wilt thou leave me, Douglas—leave me here Expos'd to all the dangers of the battle, Alone, and unprotected? Doug. No, Matilda— My better angel, no.—Honour and fame Hold but the second place, when thou art near me. Here will I stay and guard thee. Matilda. Where shall we turn for safety?—how escape?— The battle rages round us—much I fear Our short-liv'd ray of hope is set for ever. Doug. The noise grows loud and nearer.—O Matilda, Thy presence now has damp'd the martial spirit That glow'd within my breast.—I am a coward, And every shout of war-appals my soul.— Look up, my love,—I'll guard thee to the fortress.— Give me thy arm. As they are going out, enter Duke of Orleans, Clermont, and French Soldiers. Duke. O ecstasy of bliss!—Matilda's safe.— My child—my dearest child! and do these arms Once more embrace thee?—How to thee, brave Douglas, Shall my full heart pour forth its gratitude?— To thee whose gallant arm— Doug. Not to my arm— Though I would die to save her—does your daughter Now owe her life—St. Pol's repentant sword— [Alarm. Duke. The thunder of the battle louder swells; But we will face the storm, or perish in it. Retire, my child, and quit this scene of danger. [Douglas leads Matilda off, and returns. Shout. Enter the Captal de Buche, and English Soldiers. Captal. The victory is ours.—The savage rout Are all dispers'd.—Now let the sword of conquest Be sheath'd in peace—nor wanton cruelty Disgrace the English banners.—To the arm Of slow impartial justice be it left To mark the guilty, and avenge the wrongs Oppression has committed, on the head Of the oppressor only.—But the soldier Who points his sword against a breast unarm'd, Forfeits his claim to glory, and has stain'd His fame by coward murder. Duke. Generous knight, Whose heart has thus o'erleap'd the partial bounds Of local prejudice, and sav'd your foes, Accept my warmest thanks. Captal. I should disgrace This shining badge of glorious chivalry Disgrace my country's name—disgrace my leader, And let me say, my friend, whose sable arms On glory's field eclipse the brightest lustre Of warlike pride—the gallant Prince of Wales, Who boasts the noblest and the gentlest heart That ever beat within a warrior's bosom.— If sense of danger, or a nation's quarrels, Could tempt me for a moment to forget The claims of justice and humanity.— Duke. Glorious example of your country's virtue, Be our defender and our leader still.— To you I yield the castle.— [Offering the keys. Captal. As a friend, By social courtesy receiv'd, I'll enter; Not as a master or a conqueror. For while the truce continues, England's warriors Behold no foe in France.—If aught remains That may secure this city from the outrage Of these dispers'd assailants, we are ready To mingle arms with yours:—that task perform'd, We quit your towers; prepar'd, when war's loud blast Once more shall warn us to the field of glory, Again to win them bravely with our swords, Not basely steal them by insidious treaty. Duke. Throw wide the castle's gates,—and as these warriors, Our brave defenders,—sons of faith and honour, Enter the walls, let the loud trumpet speak A soldier's welcome.—But, my lord, behold A shining train of beauty comes to pay The homage due to valour, and to glory. Enter the Duchess of Orleans, Matilda, and Ladies. Duch. Here, at your feet, illustrious warrior, see This band of noble maids, and virtuous matrons, Who owe their lives and honour to your sword. Captal. O, madam, rise.—Our soldiers' cheeks will blush To see the knee of beauty bent to those, Whose highest glory is to be its slaves. What knight would not be proud to shed his blood In your defence?—O! I am amply paid, In being but the casual instrument Of your deliverance. St. Pol led in wounded. St. Pol. Here let me rest.— O, Douglas! can you now forgive the outrage Of base ingratitude?— Doug. O, nobly have you Repaid the trifling service of Poitiers.— St. Pol. Amid the battle's fury A happy sword has reach'd my life.—I die; But die fair honour's convert.—May my blood Expiate my country's wrongs.—And you, my Douglas, Can you forget?— Doug. Never, the arm that sav'd us.— All else effac'd.—My friend, my noble friend.— St. Pol. Generous, as brave.—Matilda! O, Matilda! Can I look up to thee?—my ruffian arm Presum'd to violate by its rude touch Thy heavenly charms—I dare not ask forgiveness. Matilda. O, witness heaven and earth! my soul forgives thee As truly as I hope its various faults Will meet with pardon at the throne of grace.— Look up, St. Pol, and live. St. Pol. It cannot be.— I do not wish to live,—blest with your pardon, I have no other care.—But could my life Be yet restor'd, so ardent is my passion, I might relapse, and stain once more my honour With further infamy.—O, my best Clermont! Give me thy hand,—thou wert my guardian genius, Thy counsel sav'd me,—sav'd my friends, and country. Farewell,—farewell, Matilda!—one last look,— 'Tis past,—I'm gone, and this world now is nothing. [Dies. Captal. Bear him hence, warriors,—and a soldier's honours Shall grace his obsequies.—His blood has cancell'd The errors of his conduct.—Let his virtues Live with eternal blazon.—Noble Orleans, Lead to the citadel,—there every thought Of private woe, and public strife suspended, We'll celebrate the triumphs of the day That sav'd this beauteous train from shame and ruin. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, SPOKEN BY MRS. POPE. WELL, now the scene of ancient times is o'er, And I, in proper person, come once more— But, among friends, in spite of old renown, I like the modern manners of the Town— Though musty antiquarians love to praise The dress and manners of those formal days, Talk of the courage of the knights of old And dames so very chaste, reserv'd, and cold; 'Twas fear and prudery—they were not bold— For all their bragging, each advent'rous knight, Cas'd like a lobster, sallied to the fight— Our warriors go with breasts unarm'd and bare, Save that the shining gorget dangles there— Each dame of old, to shew her skin afraid, Up to the throat in whalebone was array'd; Our modern dames such armour throw aside, The throat's almost the only part they hide; While huge cravats the lovely fair ones deck With all the beauties of a goutre'd neck; Each in the zone of Grecian Venus drest, Freezes her own, to fire her lover's breast.— Their hours so strange too—rising with the light, They din'd at noon, and went to bed at night; We dine at night, their antique manners scorning, And go, like Lear, “to supper in the morning.” Yet should a foe presume to tread this shore, Brave as the hardy race who liv'd of yore, Our gallant warriors, though not arm'd, but drest, Would make a barrier of each patriot breast: While beauty's smiles the victor's meed remain, And beauty's precious tears embalm the slain; And youths by glory fir'd, their country's pride, Eager to combat on Britannia's side, Like Edward's warlike heroes, lead to fight A people arming in their Monarch's right.</field>
