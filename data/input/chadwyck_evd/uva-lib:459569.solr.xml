      <field name="fulltext">The Prologe. Aristophones as Valerius doth tell, Introduceth Pericles in a Commedie, That he being reduced, againe out of Hell, Unto Thathenienses did thus prophesie. Bringe vp no Lyons in your Cities wantonly, For as you bring them vp in actes pernicious, So in the same you must be to them obsequious. By this saith Valerius he doth admonish, That rich men sonnes be from euell manners refrained Least that with profuse fondnes we do them norish, Uertue of them euer after be disdained: So that when authoritie, they haue obtained, They them selues being giuen to inconuenience, Oppresse their subiects vnder their obedience, Oh how noble a thing is good education, For all estates profitable: but for them chiefely Which by birth are like to haue gubernation, In publikque weales, that they may rule euer iustly: For while the Romanes did forsee this matter wisely, They had a wise Senate which preuailed alway, And that being neglected, they fell soone to decay. To be a good man it is also expedient, Of good Parents to be begotten and borne, In deede to all men it is most euident, That a pleasaunt Rose springeth of a sharpe Thorne, But commonly of good Seed procedeth good Corne, Good Parents in good manners do instruct their childe, Correcting him when he beginneth to grow wilde: The bringing vp of a childe from his tender age, In vertue, is a great helpe to be an honest man, But when youth is suffred to haue his owne rage, It falleth to much calamity now and than: I would wish Parents and Masters to do what they can Both to teach and correct their youth with reason, That it may profit the publique weale an other season. To helpe hereto good Schoole Masters are necessarie, Sage, sober, expert, learned, gentle and prudent, Under such Masters youth can neuer miscarie, For either they refraine euils with good aduisement, Or to occupy the minde good lessons do inuent: To youth nothing in the world is so pernicious: As to be conuersant, with masters laciuious, Bringing vp is a great thing, so is dilligence, But nothing, God except, is so strong of Nature, For neither councell, learninge nor sapience, Can an euill nature to honest manners allure: Do we not see at these daies so many past cure, That nothing can their crokednes rectefie, Till they haue destroied them vtterly? The Image of such persons we shall introduce, Represented by one whom Moros we do call, By him we shall declare the vnthriftie abuse, Of such as had leuer to Folly and Idlenes fall, Then to herken to Sapience when he doth call: There processe, how their whole life they do spende, And what shame they com to at the last ende: Wherfore this our matter we entitle and name, The longer thou liuest the more Foole thou arte. Are there not many which do verefie the same? Yes I warrant you, and naturally play that parte, Yea, euen from the Iudgment seat vnto the Carte: But truly we meane no person perticularly, But only to specifie of such generally: Holsom lessons now and than we shall enterlace, Good for the ignorant, not hurtfull to the wise, Honest mirth shall com in, and appeare in place, Not to thaduauncement, but to the shame of vice, To extoll Uertue without faile is our deuise, A season we shall desier you of pacience, And to make you mery we will do our dilligence. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Here entreth Moros, counterfaiting a vaine gesture and a foolish countenance, Synging the foote of many Songes, as fooles were wont. Moros. Brome, Brome on hill, The gentle Brome on hill hill: Brome, Brome on Hiue hill, The gentle Brome on Hiue hill, The Brome standes on Hiue hill a. Robin lende to me thy Bowe, thy Bowe, Robin the bow, Robin lende to me thy bow a: There was a Mayde come out of Kent, Deintie loue, deintie loue, There was a mayde cam out of Kent, Daungerous be: There was a mayde cam out of Kent, Fayre, propre, small and gent, As euer vpon the grounde went, For so should it be. By a banke as I lay, I lay, Musinge on things past, hey how. Tom a lin and his wife, and his wiues mother They went ouer a bridge all three together, The bridge was broken and they fell in, The Deuill go with all quoth Tom a lin. Martin swart and his man, sodledum sodledum, Martin swart and his man sodledum bell. Com ouer the Boorne Besse, My little pretie Besse, Com ouer the Boorne besse to me. The white Doue sat on the Castell wall. I bend my Bow and shoote her I shall, I put hir in my Gloue both fethers and all. I layd my Bridle vpon the shelfe, If you will any more sing it your selfe: Discipline. O Lorde are you not ashamed, Thus vainly the time to spende, Your friendes by you are defamed: I would haue you this geare to amend: What, to a good age now you grow, It is time childishnesse to forsake, I would finde somwhat to do I trowe, And not like a foole such a noyse to make, Goyng vp and downe like a witlesse Boy, Singing and bellowing like a dawe, If you will not amend this toy, We will bring you to an other awe. Moros. I haue Twentie mo songs yet, A fond woman to my Mother, As I war wont in her lappe to sit, She taught me these and many other, I can sing a song of Robin Redbrest, And my litle pretie Nightingale, There dwelleth a iolly Foster here by west, Also I com to drink som of your Christmas ale Whan I walke by my selfe alone, It doth me good my songs to render, Such pretie thinges would soone be gon, If I should not somtime them remembre. Discipline, Gaudet stultis Natura creandis. Nature hath a pleasure Fooles to creat, Vt maluis atque vrticis &amp; vilibus herbis. As Mallowes, Nettles and weedes of that rate, Hii sunt obtuso ingenio crasso cerebro. These are dull of wit and of a grosse braine, Et nihili pendunt animi bona depeci ludo. And set at nought Uertue geuen to pastime vaine, These verses I may on you verefie, Except you will take an other way, I would be glad your manners to rectefie, If you wold heare what I will say, For shame I say yet againe, Forget your babish vanitie, Folly and vice you must refraine, And giue your selfe to humanitie, Moros. I am good at scourging of my Toppe, You would laugh to se me mosel the pegge, Upon my one foote pretely I can hoppe, And daunce trimly about an Egge: Also, when we play and hunt the fox, I outrun all the boyes in the schoole: My mother gaue me a Boule of Box, Alone I am to handle such a toole I can com softly behinde a Boye, And giue him a blow and run away: My mother teacheth me many a pretie toy, You shall know what they be one day, When to fight ? my father thou doest purpose Plucke him vpward by the heare still, With thy knockles strike him on the nose, Let him not goe till thou haue thy will. Discipline. Quales quisque sibi natos eduxit habebit. As one bringeth vp, his Children saith he, So shall he haue them, wise or without wit, Therfore parents are to blame as here we see But to you now I pray you tell, Be these the best lessons of your Parents? Moros. No forsooth I can ring the Saunce Bell, And fetch fier when they go to Mattins. Discipline. Better it were to haue no education, Then to be instructed in any part of Idolatry For there is no part without abhominacion, But all together full of sectes and heresie, Moros. Nay I can more th? that, harke in your eare To call him knaue I go not behinde the doore Be bold ? my father and do not feare, If thy mother anger thee, call hir whore. Discipline. Without doubt such lewde persons there are, And this is the cause that so many euill men, Now replenish the earth with sorrow and care, Not one good man is scarsly among ten, Let this vngracious and foolish person, Bee as an Image of such bringing vp, Like to be as vnhappie a patron, As euer dranke of any mans cup: For the loue that we owe to mankind, And chiefly vnto Christianitie, We will proue to alter his minde, And bring him to humanitie. Pietie. All haile right honorable Discypline, Well occupied euer more I do you finde Instructing one or other with doctrine, According to your Naturall kinde: Which is both comly manners to teach, And also to minister correction: If all men vnto your precepts would reach, Soone should be clensed all infection. Discipline, O welcom Pietie, the doore of all vertue, In you consisteth gods honour vertue and loue Without the which no good thing can ensue, As by the christian Poet we do proue: Hoc sine Virtutis alias nihil est putato, Without the worship of God omnipotent, Which learned men properly call Pietie Other Uertues be they neuer so excellent, Are estemed but as things of vilitie. Entre Exercitati? And as vertu, is no vertue without Pietie So without the same, vice can not be eschued Pietie is a trew honor of Gods maiestie, Wherwith christians should be endued, God to worship, to loue, to feare, to praise, His holy commaundements to obey: To be occupied in his lawes nightes and dayes This propperly is called Pietie I say. Moros. By my troth if you wil can me good thanke, I will bring you to a pretie Birds neast, Uerely I thinke it be a red shanke, She is white in the taile, and blacke in ye brest. Discipline. The longer thou liuest the more Foole yu art The more instruction, the lesse Sapience, Grace will not enter into a foolish hart, Iniquitie stoppeth out intelligence, To you Pietie, and Exercitacion, Of such folly, I haue admonished him: But I can haue none other communication, So vainly haue his parents norished him. Pietie. Thus the Christian Poet to wright was wont, Without industry, all things mortall, NaturÃ¦ inscinctu, sponte ruunt. By very nature, vnto vice do fall: But as we see by experience, A barren Field is made fat and firtle, If men will adhibit their dilligence, And labour about it a while: So though this yong fellow, be foolish as yet, With labour and dilligent admonition, He may in prosses of time, learne wit, And be willing to take erudition. Exercita. Uertue hath very hard entraunces, But ready is the way vnto vice: And there to fall we all, not by chaunces, But willingly if we be not ware and wise. Now wheras the Lads education, Hath ben rude, foolish, fond, and vaine, Let vs giue him good information, And to proffit him let vs gladly take paine. Discipline, do you still your indeuer: To cause him perfectly to know Pietie, That is: God to serue, to feare, to loue, to honour. And his Parents to obey with humillitie. Then you know? that I Exercitation, According as I shall see his aptnes, I will exercise him in good occupacion, Wherby he shall eschew Idlenes. Moros. In S. Nicolas shambles ther is inough, Or in Eastcheape, or at Saint Katherins, There be good Poddings at the signe of the Plough, You neuer did eate better Sauserlinges. Discipline. This folly is not his Innocency, Which can in this wise, lewdly ouerwhart, But it is a malicious Insolentie, Which procedeth from a wicked harte. Pietie. Com hither brother, com hither: Your name to me you must disclose. Discipline. His folly his master did consider, And therfore called him nothing but Moros. Pietie. Moros is a foole by interpretacion But wisdom goeth not all by the name, He that is a foole in conuersation, As a foole in deede we may him blame, I know som that be named happy: And som good, blessed, and fortunable, Yet truly there be none more vnlucky, Worse more wicked and vnproffitabe, And though Moros, a foole doth signifie, Yet you may be wise as I trust you will, If you will sarue god as you ought dilligently, He shall giue you wisdom, if you pray still. Moros. I may tell you, my Father did like me well I am the wisest child that euer he had, Often times I haue herd him say or tell, My boy Moros will proue a wise Lad. Exercitation. If you can remember your fathers saying, Why can you not remember good lessons aswell: You may not set your minde vpon playing, But apply your selfe to Disciplines counsell. Discipline. My counsell is that you feare God aboue all: Pray vnto him to giue you Sapience, Cease not vpon his holy name to call: Be meeke in sprite, fast and keepe abstinence, His Ministers, Preistes and Preachers, Such as rule the holy Church Catholique: Obey I meane such as be true teachers, Companie not with any Heretike. An Heretike, him holy Doctors do call, Which erreth in Gods most sacred Scripture, Which is blinde and seeth not his owne fall, But maliciously doth in errour endure, The greatest Heresie that euer was, Hath the Pope and his adherentes published, Yea the Heresie of Arius it doth passe, For Christe and his benefites it hath extinguished, Example by the wicked Masse satisfactorie, Which to Christes death they make equiuolent, For they call it a Sacrifice propiciatorie, Which is an heresie most pestilent. Agayne, praier to Sainctes that be dead, Which is a great poynte of infidelitie, For they forsake Christe which is the head Who taught to worship in sprite and veretie. Exercitation. Can you recite wisely agayne, Disciplines counsell and monition. Moros. Can I? yea I trow I can and that playne, If you suffer me without interruption, First he said beare an od ende with an all, Play now and then in thy masters absence: Cease not a knaue by his right name to call, Much on the Spitte is past abstinence. Discipline. Loe you here? what a patron this is, Thinke you that he is not past grace. Exercitation. Yet I say, he that hath wit to do this, May turne to Uertue also in space. Pietie. Com hither I pray the tell me but one thing, How intendest thou to liue an other day. Moros. How? truly make mery, daunce and sing, Set cocke a whope, and play care away: Pietie. Seing that you haue none other respect, But your life daies in folly to spende, Discipline must you now and then correct, That vnto wisdom you may your selfe bende. Moros. Correct ? he? why shall I be beaten? My father will not suffer that I trow. Discipline. You begin to be scabbie and worme eaten, It is time Salt vpon you to strow, Sirra, do you see what I haue here, The wise man willeth, an Asse to haue a scourge, You haue learned folly many a yeare, From the same now I must you purge: You that haue the wit to mocke and to scorne, What wit you haue to wisdom I will see, Upon your sides this scourge shalbe worne, Except you will speake rightly after me, I will loue and feare God aboue all. Moros. sai after him I will loue &amp;c. Discipline. He might vouchsafe to giue me sapience. Moros. He might vouchsafe &amp;c. Discipline. I shall not cease on his holy name to call. Moros. I shall not cease &amp;c. Discipline. That he will open mine intelligence, Moros. That he will &amp;c. Discipline. Well sayd. Moros. Well sayd. Discipline. Say the same verses alone together, Like as you sayd them after me. Moros. Say the same verses alone together, Like as you sayd them after me. Pietie. His meaning you do not consider, Alone you must say the verses as they be. Moros. His meaning you do not consider, Alone you must say the verses as they be. Exercitation. You may say no more as he did say, He did but teach you your wordes wisely to frame Moros. You may say no more as he did say, He did but teach you your wordes wisely to frame Discipline. With an vngracious foole we spend the day He turneth all to a mocke and a game. Moros. With an vngracious foole we spend the day, He turneth all to a mocke and a game. Discipline. Uexation they say giueth intelligence, An other while I will proue you with my scourge. Moros. Uexacion they say giueth intelligence, An other while I will proue you with my scourge Pietie. This heady foolishnes and negligence, With correction away we must purge. Moros. This heady foolishnes, and negligence, With correction away we must purge. Exercitation. We will holde him while you do him beate, Lay on Discypline, and do not spare. Moros. I trowe I shall make you all thre to sweate, Holde him &amp; beate him. Com one for one, and for you all I doe not care. Body of god, alas my arse, out, out no more, Crie you mercie, a vengeaunce take you, For Gods sake leaue mine arse is sore I will say as you will haue me say now. Discipline. Say thus. Moros. Say thus. Discipline I will loue and feare God aboue all, He might vouchsafe to giue me Sapience: I will not cease on his holy name to call, That he may open mine intelligence. Pietie. Good sonne say these wordes and thinke ye same And we will teache you other good lessons moe. Moros. You haue put me out God giue you shame, I wot not which way the Deuil they goe. Discipline. Repete them againe I will loue &amp;c. Moros. I will loue porridge when they be sod, Beef &amp; al For Motton good Sause is Salte and Onnions, Up vnto the hie dishe when my Dame they call, While she openeth the Pie, I picke the Pinions. Pietie. Let vs loose no more labour about this foole For the more he is taught the worse he is. Discipline, Holde him, and I will teache him a new schoole, He can speake the right that can speake this, Moros. O beate me no more, I pray you hartly, To make you to laugh I turned them this way, Somtime I loue to talke and sing merely, But I thinke no harme then by this day. Exercitation. In you let vs some towardnes see, For to make you a man we do intend, To laugh, to be mery, to singe, times there be, But in such thinges now we haue no time to spende, Pietie. Let vs heare how Discypline you do vnderstand, The sentence that he hath taught you do you say. Moros. That is ye best way I thinke to escape your hand But I trust to be euen with you one day: I will loue and feare god aboue all, He might vouchsafe to giue me Sapience, I will not cease on his holy name to call, That he may open mine intelligence. Discipline. This is well if it be spoken with the hart, Feare somtime causeth dissimulation. Moros. I can not speake it I suppose without a harte, After feare cometh alway consolation, Pietie. I perceiue that you haue wit competentlie, If you would applie it vnto vertue, We will instruct you sufficiently, If our Doctrine you will humbly ensue Exercitation. By vs you shall haue this commoditie, In this life you shall be in reputacion, After this life you shall haue felicitie: That is Ioy in the heauenly habitacion. Discipline. My sonne this order with you we will take, First I will comit you vnto Pietie, Who the true seruaunt of God shall you make, And teach you to honour his Maiestie, Here let Moros betwene euery sentence say Gay geare, good stufe, very well, finado, with such mockish termes. [Discipline.] To loue him, to pray to him, day and night, To knowe his sonne Iesus Christ, Equale with the Father in substance and might, The holy Ghost the author of loue and concorde, In him you shall learne Gods worde to heare, Your dutie to the Ministers of the same, Who the misteries of God in their harts do beare To esteeme the sacraments eche one by name, Pietie will teache you your dutie to kinges, To rulers and Maiestrates, in their degree, Unto whom you must be obedient in all thinges Conserning the statutes and lawes of the Countrie, It is Pietie your Parents to obey, Yea your Prince and Countrey to defend, The poore to comfort euer as you may, For the truthes sake your bloud to spend. Moros. Nay hoo there by God all things saue bloud, He that breaketh my head I will breake his againe. Pietie. Your vnderstanding in that is not good, Such appetites you must alway refraine. Exercitation. After that you are endued with Pietie, In me you shall haue Exercitacion, To your owne and other mens vtilitie, I meane a science or occupacion, Which to learne do your dilligence, And being learned, do the same occupie, And occupied by experience, Seeke to exercise them busely, Discipline. How say you will you dwell with Pietie, And learne his instructions with a good will, Moros. I thanke you for your good minde towarde me, I will neuer go from you but dwell with you still. Pietie. First vnto you a testament heare I giue, Wherein you shall learne what the will of God is To pray vpon and to learne your Christen beleue, And to amend your manners that be amisse. Moros. Gods santie, this is a goodlie Booke in deede, Be there anie Saints in it and Pilerowes, A sir, I haue spied Christes Crosse me speede, I may tell you I am past all my Crosse rowes, I haue learned beyond the ten commaundementes, Two yeares ago doubtlesse I was past grace, I am in the middest of Gods Iudgements, I trust to be as wise as he with in short space. Pietie. I must haue all these vaine wordes to cease, An other leafe you must turne now truly. Moros. Of good Milke if you will giue me daily a messe, You shall see I will wait vpon you duly. Pietie. It is so that I may no longer tarry here, I must go hence, come will you go with me? Moros. Yea that I will, for here is litle good chere, What good fare you haue I purpose to se. Disciplne, Looke that you doo your selfe honestlie behaue, For I purpose to se you euery day thrise, Neither mockes nor gaudes shall your skinne saue, I aduise you therefore to be honest and wise. Exercitati? In doing well, feare ye no punishment, Be ruled by the counsell of Discipline, Your owne follie will be your detriment, If you from Pietie chaunce to decline. Moros. I warrant you in paine of twentie shames, I am wonne now, you shall se me verie honest, But yer I go yet let me know your names, Declare them I pray you at my request. Discipline. You know that my name is Discipline, Moros. Uerie well, verie well Diricke Quintine, You are maister Diricke Quintine. Pietie. Ofttimes you haue heard me called Pietie, Moros. Maister Pinenuttree, and maister Diricke Quintine Exercitati? I exercise men in good workes and Doctrine, And therfore Exercitati? they call me. Moros. Arse out of fashion, here is a mistication, Dirike Quintine will gather Rodes of the Pinenuttre, And beate mine arse till it be out of fashion, With this deuise truly I can not agre. Discipline. Why stand you murmuring there alone, Giue eare vnto the wordes that to you be said. Pietie. Come Moros, come good sonne, I must be gone, To dwell with me, you neede not be afraide. Moros. Afrayde, no I will go with you to the worlds ende, I promise you to be true night and day, For though neuer so much aboute me you do spend, I will not beare the valor of a pennie away. Go before him and yet saye. Pietie. Wee haue taken a busie worke vpon vs, For al our wordes he is not the better one Pease. Discipline. Well a season with him take ye paine, Wee will proue if we can do any good. Moros. With them if long you do here remaine, Go out pieti and Moros. I will go seeke a new Master by the roode Exercitation. How thinke you, truly I am in dispaire I feare that all our labour wil be lost, He is not bent neither to abstinence nor praier, I am aduised to bestow on him no more cost. Discipline. Ipsaque non multo est natura potentior vsu, I like well that he is gone with Pietie, For conuersation with persons of vertue Altereth nature sometime for a suertie: Custome may all kinde of manners bring forth, This to be true wee know by experience, But if he decay wee must take it at worth, At the least let vs doo our diligence. Exercita. If he had been taken somewhat in season, Betweene whiles let Moros put in his head. I woulde haue hoped in his amendement: But folly hath so ouercharged his reason, That he is past redresse in my iudgement: While a plant of a Tree is yonge and tender, You may cause it to grow croked or right: So a childe, while knowledge is but slender, You may instructe whereto you will by might; But after the Plante is growne to a tree, To any bowinge it will not geue place: So yonge folkes when to age growne they be, Waxe stubborne and be of an indurate face; Againe he is of a verie haughtie nature, A witte, but to no goodnesse applied, If he shalbe suffered to endure, Muche euill by him shalbe multiplied. Discipline Let vs se how he doth profit in Pietie, If he goeth any thing forewarde therein: Unto labour, vertue, and veritie, I will hope him easely to winne, For as I saide here a litle before, Who so doth God faithfully sarue and feare, And aboue all thinges him serue and honour, He shall thriue, go forward, and prospere. Exercitation. I beleue that with Pietie he went, From correction him selfe to winde, For if he to any vertue be bente, I am much deceaued truly in my minde: Certaine persons I coulde rehearse by name, Haue pretended a great perfection, And why? to auoyde punishment and shame, Due for their vitious infection: As sum haue entred into religion, Wherefore because they will not pay their det, When they are persons of no good deuotion, For vpon vanitie their harts are set. Discipline. Go wee softly and herken for his fashion, If with any lewdnesse I chaunce him to take, I shall minister to him such correction, As shall make his flesh tremble and quake. Exercita. With Pietie, you are not like him to finde, He did put in his head twise or thrise, He looketh for mates of an other kinde, Wholy he is geuen to folly and vice. Discipline He is like to escape very narowly, If neither of vs catche him by the backe, Except he be corrected throughly, He will still vse his foolish knacke. Go out both. Here entreth Idlenesse. Where the deuill is the horsen foole, He bad me euen now come hither, Doubtlesse he is gone agayne to schoole, Euen very now wee weare together, Truly they will make him a foole in deede: Teache him good manners, teache my dogge, When you see him in learning proceede, Then will I make a man of this logge: What ho, where art thou Moros? what ho? Doubtlesse they take payne aboute a stone, Doting fooles thinke to make Corne to grow Upon grauell, where earth there is none. Moros. Crie without the doore making a noyse of beating. Alas, alas nomore, nomore, nomore, Nomore good Maister Diricke Quintine, Bodie of God you beate me so sore, I will forsake you and your doctrine. Idlenes. No force hardely let them not spare, What doth the foole in suche companye, O that they would beate him on the buttockes bare, To se that I would spend an halfe penny, What howe Moros come hether I say, He will not tary longe I dare warrant, He and I mete euer once in a day, Litle will he sticke to play the trewant. Here entreth Incontinence. What Idlenes the parent of all vice, Who thought to haue found the heare. Idlenes. Then art thou neyther mannerly nor wise, As by thy salutation doth appeare, For if I of vice be the parent, Then thy parent I must needes be, Thou art a vice by all mens consent, Therfore it is like that I begat thee. Incontinence. My parent, then hang my parent, No Syr I am your fellow and mate, Therwith you may be well content, For I am of no small estate: Otium enim fomes vitiorum est otium mentem, Ad multa mala trahunt otii comes ipsa libido est. Idlenes of vices is a prouocation, To many euils Idlenesse draweth the minde, Lust or lecherous inclination, Is fellow to Idlenes by kinde, Lo I haue proued by authoritie, That I am thy fellow as I sayde, To be my parent it were temeritie, Your argument here I haue stayd. Idlenes. They were thine owne wordes and not mine, The parent of all vice thou diddest me call, Then it foloweth that I am thine, For thou art the greatest vice of all, The greatest mischeif that euer chaunced, Cam by the meanes of inconstancie, For where as thou art enhaunced, There is all mischefe and insolencie. Here entreth Wrath. Make roume, stande backe in the Deuils name Stande backe or I will lay thee on the face. Incontinence. Marie stande thou backe with a verie shame, Is there not roume inough in the place. Idlenesse. It is but a coppie of his countenaunce, Wrath must declare his propertie. Incontinence. He is as whot as a vengeance, Stande backe and geue him libertie. Wrath. I had went it had been another, I thought to haue geuen thee a blow, In my rage I fauour not my brother, The nature of Wrath full well you do know. Idlenesse. Wrath and Madnesse they say be all one, Sauing that Madnesse doth still remaine: But wrath in fooles will soone be gone, Yea and as soone it wil come againe. Incontinence. To fooles not only incontinencie Is annexed but wrath also furious, The minde of fooles without clemencie, Soone waxeth hotte and is temerarious. Wrath. Speaking of fooles, it cometh to my remembrance, I thought to haue founde Moros the foole here: Idlenesse. He goeth to schoole now with a vengeance, He shalbe a Doctour the next yere. Wrath. To schoole, ha, ha, ha, as angrie as I am, I must laugh to here of Moros such newes Idlenesse. I spake with him as hither I cam, And willed him their schooling to refuse. Incontinence. They keepe him there still by violence, But I know that with vs is his harte. Wrath. When they bringe Moros vnto Sapience, Then of my sworde I will make a Carte. Idlenesse. I suppose that he will not be longe hence, If by any meanes he may escape. Incontin. I dare wage with any man fortie pence, To make him shortly as wise as an Ape. Wrath. That wager with thee durst I lay, To make him so wise thou art not able, For he is as verie a foole I dare say, And as starke an Idiot as euer bare bable. Idlenesse. Yea but he shalbe a more foole yet, When all wee three be vnto him annexed: For the trueth is he hath now some wit, But then all his wittes shalbe perplexed, With me he is very well aqueinted, For all his bringing vp hath been with me, So that any vertue he coulde neuer se: Therefore pastime he calleth me alway, In plaies and games he hath no measure, Incontinencie to him thou must say, That thy name is called pleasure. Inconttnen. I am called so with them that be wise, Wrath is wonte to be called manhode. Wrath. In good faith litle needeth this deuise, To be called by our names is as good: Doth he know what Idlenesse doth meane, Knoweth he incontinencie to be leacherie, He discerneth not cleane from vncleane, His minde is all set on foolerie. Idlenesse. Se, se, woulde you iudge him a foole, So sadly as he readeth on his booke. Inconti. By like he cometh now from schoole, On his lesson earnestly he doth looke. Wrath. Haue you seene a more foolish face, I must laugh to se how he doth looke. Idlenesse. Holde your peace a litle space, And heare him reade vpon his booke. Here entreth Moros looking vpon a booke. and often times looke behinde him, reade as fondely as you can deuise. Laugh all three at his reading. Moros. Body of God laugh you me to scorne, I will tell Maister Diricke Quintine, By these tenne bones I will, I haue sworne, And he shall teache you to make tile pinne, Take heede of arse out of fashion, I aduise you come not in his clawes, I will tell them by Godes Passion, How you iudge them fooles and dawes. I would you were with pynenuttre, He would make you a litle sadder, You shall go vp to the gallow tree, And come downe without a ladder, Wrath. You are well learned it doth appeare, Can you any Lattin to vs speake. Moros. I can sing Custodi nos in the queere, And a verse of course finely broake. Incontinence. Redde you Lattin, or Greeke, in your booke, What was it I pray you let vs knowe. Moros. Here you may see if you will looke, It was the cuckoles crosse rowe. Idlenesse. That crosse rowe let vs here I pray the, And a point for thy labour thou shalt haue. Moros. I am but a learner you may see, I can no further then K for a knaue. Godes santy pastime my playfellow, For Godes sake kepe me from Diricke Quintine. Idlenesse. If my councell thou wilt followe, I will kepe the from him and from his doctrine. Incontinence. He speaketh of one Diricke Quintine, Pinenuttre and arse out of fashion, Doth he not meane old Discypline, Pietie and Exercitation, Idlenesse. Yes pardie, but so to speake he can not, Tell him one thing twenty times, And he will forget it by and by God wot, Yet can he sing songes and make rymes. Wrath. What neede we to chaung our names for him, For he discerneth not cheese from chalke, He careth not who doth sincke or swimme, So that in his owne wayes he may walke. Moros. Shall I speake with you pastime in your eare, A word or two I would tell you of my mind, Mast pastime this same grimman I do feare, Trowe you that he will be my friend. Idlenesse. I warrant the all we be thy friendes here, We come to ridde the out of thy foes bandes. Incontinence. Feare none of vs but be thou of good chere, Bidde vs welcome and take vs by the handes. Moros. Bidde vs welcome and take vs by the handes, Take them by the hand. Bidde vs welcome and take vs by the handes, Bidde vs welcome and take vs by the handes. Wrath. Gramercy Moros how do you. Idlenesse. You are welcome Master manhode say, Moros. You are welcome Master Robinhode say, Idlenesse. You shall cough me a foole I make God auowe, Moros. You shall cough me a foole I make God auowe, Incontinence. I can laugh well at him by this day, Moros. I can laugh well at him by this day. Idlenesse. Come to me Moros what doost thou with this booke, Thou canst not reade vpon it I am sure. Moros. Pynenuttre toke it me thereon to looke, There are goodly saintes in it fayre and pure. Wrath. Alas one worde to reade in it he is not able, More fooles then he to geue him a booke, A foole will delight more in a bable, And more mete for him theron to looke. Idlenesse. Haue a paier of cardes redy Looke what a booke I haue for thee here, Cast away that booke it is worse then nought. Inconttnen. This booke will make the of a lusty chere, If thou wilt beare it alway in thy thought. Moros. Goddes dayes it is a goodly booke in deede, Santy amen here are saintes a great sort, This booke passeth Christes Crosse me speede, Ha, ha, ha, to he, ha, ha, ha, here is goodly sport, But let not Diricke Quintine this booke see, He did sett me a lesson to can. Wrath. None of them all shall meddle with thee, Wee are come to make thee a man. Idlenesse. Make curtsie, and say I thanke you manhoode. Moros. Make curtsie, and say I thanke you Robin hoode, Make curtsie backward Goddes se here is a goodly gentlewoman, Here are speckes, some blacke, some redde as bloud, Teache me this booke I pray you perfitly to can. Idlenesse. If I wist that thou wouldest be pretie and wise, I would geue thee other thinges therwith to play, Seest thou these bones? these are a payre of Dice, I will teache thee to occupie them one day. Moros. You taught me first to play at blow pointe, At spanne counter, coyting, and mosell the pegge, At skayles, and the playing with a sheepes ioynte, And to hop a good way on my one legge: How long was I learning of these playes, I am apt inough such good thinges to take, Do you no more but shew me the wayes, And if I learne not let me lose the stake. Idlenesse. Looke what I haue done for thee beside, Here haue I gotten thee companie, Whether so euer thou wilt go or ride, To defende thee from all villanie: Lo, this gentleman is called pleasure, He will teache thee to handle a wenche, Meanes I will teache thee to get treasure, For such thinges wee will make a Trenche. Moros. Sir is your name called play sure, You are welcome, I thanke you hartly. Incontinen. Tush foole my name is called pleasure, That is likinge, and lust bodily, Fooles loue alway such daliance, To kisse, to clip, and in bed to play, Oh, with lustie girles to singe and daunce, To haue a more pleasant life no man may. Moros. O I meane what you know now, Maister Pastime hearke againe in your eare. Idlenesse. Tush, tush, I warrant thee, care not thou, I will prouide for all such geare, Lo, this is manhoode to make thee bolde, Let there be but a worde and a blow. Moros. I woulde looke bigge like a man, that I woulde If my bearde woulde a litle more grow. Wrath. Suffer no man with thee to reason, For fooles can no wise answer make, Therfore geue a blow alway in season, Passe not thou how they do it take, Like a man euer face out the mater, Sticke not bloud, harte, and woundes to sweare, But suffer no man with thee to clatter, Anon let him haue a blow on the eare: Beholde here I geue thee a good sworde And a dagger thy selfe to defende, Draw thy dagger at euery worde, And say that thy bloud thou wilt spende. Moros. Bolde (? he) I pray you keepe my booke, These weapens haue set me on a fier: Florish with your sworde. How say you, like a man do I not looke, To be fighting now is all my desire, No remedie, with one of you I must fight, Fende your heads, you fooles, knaues, and dawes Idlenesse. He sheweth the nature of a foole right, Which is to chide and fight without a cause. Incontinen. It is a prouerbe wise and auncient, Beware how you geue any edge toole, Unto mad men that be insipient, Unto a yonge childe, and vnto a foole. Wrath. He fighteth till he is out of breath, Inough now Moros it is well doone. Moros. By the Masse I will fight my selfe to death, I pray you let not me leaue so soone. Incontin. Sira, who am I, will you remember, What did Pastime tell you in your eare. Moros. A pretie morsell, yonge and tender, Now would to God I weare there. Idlenesse. Thou must weare thy sworde by thy side, And thy daggar handsumly at thy backe, Before thou fightest thou most vse to chide, Marke what I say and learne of me that knacke: First this order with thee we will take, We will teache thee to play at cardes and dice, Aqueinted with Nell and Nan we will thee make, And to appeare, a man both mightie and wise, We will desire pleasure to take payne, To prouide vs an hansome hospitall, Where secretly we may together remayne, Till we haue fynished our deuises all. Incontinence. Hearke is it best that there we meete, At that house such as we vse to banquette. Moros. Nay I pray you let vs haue one sheete, For I can not well lye in a blankette. Idlenesse. Tushe foole we speake of banquetting, We meane to eate, drinke, and make good chere, With Megge and Besse to be ruffeling, Where as no pleasure shall be to dere. Wrath. There are beddes, blanquets, and shetes good store, And the house of a gyrle neuer emptie, You shalbe sure of one or other euermore, Sometime you may haue your choyse of twenty. Incontinence. You meane the thacked house by the water side, Which is whitlymed aboue in the loofe. Idlenesse. Yea pardee there thou shalt for vs prouide, An house it is for the nones if it come to the proofe. Incontinence. I go hence tarry you not after long, For I will bidde myne hostesse make hast. Moros. Before you go let vs haue a song, I can retche vp to sing sol fa and past. Idlenesse. Thou hast songes good stoare sing one, And we three the foote will beare. Moros. Let me stody it will come anone, Pepe la, la, la, it is to hye there, So, ho, ho, and that is to lowe, Soll, soll, fa, fa, and that is to flatte, Re, re, re, by and by you shall knowe, My, my, my, how saye you to that. Idlenes. Care not for the true but what is thy song, No remedie thou must first beginne. Incontinence. I will be gone if you tarry long, Whan we knowe how we shall come in. Moros. I haue a prety tytmouse, Come picking on my to, All .iiii. the same. Gossuppe with you I purpose, To drinke before I go. Moros. Litle pretty nightingale, Among the braunches greene, All iiii. the same. Geue vs of your Christmasse ale, In the honour of saint Steuen. Moros. Robyn readbrest with his noates, Singing a lofte in the quere, All .iiii. the same. Warneth to get you frese coates, For winter then draweth nere. Moros. My brigle lieth on the shelfe, Yf you will haue any more, Go out Incontinencie. Uouchsafe to sing it your selfe, For here you haue all my stoare. wrath. A song much like thauthour of the same, It hangeth together like fethers in the winde. Moros. This song learned I of my dame, When she taught me mustardsede to grinde, Goddes daies is playsure gone awaye, I would haue spoken with him or euer he had gone, I am sory for that by this day, He should haue borne me a token to Ione. Idlenesse. Thou shalt beare .iiii. quarters of a foole, Perdy Ione will that best regard. Moros. Shall we go leape ouer the stoole, Or play fox the hole about the Churchyeard, I must be doing of somewhat alway, My weapon ones againe I must handle, How my dagger will cut now I will assay, Beware how with me they wandle, Fend your heades, how like you this florish, Nay I can fetch him ouer my head, This fetche amonge such as be foolish, I may tell you, will stande sometime in steade Wrath. This felow fighteth very sore alone, God haue mercy on his soule he will kill, This furie will away anon, Namely when he is acquented with gill. Idlenesse. Keepe thy fighting till discipline doth come, Then let me se how thou wilt play the man. Moros. Body of God stande away make roume, I will surely hit him if I can, O that my sworde were a mile longe, I would kill him then where as he dwelleth, Me thinke I am waxen very stronge, Se I pray you how my hart swelleth. Here entreth Discipline. The longer thou liuest the more foole thou art, A foole in childehood, a foole in vdolencie, Let Moros let fall his sworde and hide him. In mans state thou wilt play a fooles parte, And as a foole die with shame and infamie, Beate a foole in a morter saith the wise man, And thou shalt not make him leaue his folly: I haue doone all that euer I can, And I se it profiteth not truly. Moros. Saue me I pray you Maister Robin hoode, This is Diricke Quintine my maister, He will fight as he were wood, For me he hath brought yonder waster, I know Diricke Quintines intente, He will bringe me to Arse out of fashion, There in worke and labour I shall be pent, And I had leuer die by Gods passion. Wrath. Why horesun take thy sworde in thy hande, And at the gaynest vpon him lay. Idlenesse. Go to him like a man by thee I will stande, Not so hardie in his head one worde say. Moros. Sira, speake you I pray you Robin hoode, Take you my sworde and driue him hence. Wrath. What horesun I tell thee my name is manhood, I had leuer haue spente fortie pence. Discipline. Animi vilis timor Argumentum est, Feare of a vile minde is an argument, Conscience accuseth the folish beast, That he hath forsaken wholsom document. Moros. I shall haue a bearde I trow one day, Then shall I be a man stronge and bolde, If my bearde were growne to you I may say, I woulde pay him home, by God that I woulde, Wrath. Take thy sworde in thyne hande and say, I defie thee I olde rustie pesant. Moros. Take thy sworde in thine hande and say, I defie thee, I olde thurstie wesant. Wrath. Avoyde, trudge, and get thee away, Or by his hart I will cut thy wesant. Moros. A cloyde grudge but not denay, Or by his carte I will plucke a Fesant. Idlenesse. Why it is true that of thee he sayde, The longer thou liuest the more foole thou art. Moros. Bodie of God of him I am so afraide, That at euery worde I am like to farte. Wrath. The foole as yet is yonge and nesh, And the feare of Disciplin is in his minde, After that he is noseled in womans flesh, The Knaue he will play in his kinde. Idlenesse. It is euen so, a boy is neuer bolde, Till he hath companied with an hoore, Then doth he picke quarels, chide and scolde, After that he despiseth both riche and poore. Cum pleasure hath all thinges prouided, Let vs no longer tarie here, He will thinke that wee haue him derided, Go wee, let vs see his prouision and chere. Moros. I wilbe sure to be gone first, I am out of your handes Diricke Quintine, Now do thou thy best and thy worst, I defie both thee and all thy Doctrine. Go out al .iij. Discipline. Marke the trade of much youth at this day, Se if this foole painteth not out theyr image, Them they despise that eyther do or say, Any thing at all to restraine there dotage, The foole and boy sayth the Prophet Esaye, Shall presume against his ruler auncient, Young fooles do this saying verifie, To wise men it is ouer euident, When fooles are suffred in folly, And youth maintained in theyr will, When they come vp to mans state wholy, Fooles they be and so they continue still: One writteth thus among many thinges, Neuer shall you haue good men and sapient, Where there be no good children and yonglinges, Which thing is most true in my iudgement: Two thinges destroye youth at this day, Indulgentia parentum, the fondnes of parents, Which will not correct there noughty way, But rather enbolden them in there entents, Idlenesse alas Idlenesse is an other, Who so passeth through England, To se the youth he would wonder, How Idle they be and how they stand, A Christian mans hart it would pittie, To behold the euill bringing vp of youth, God preserue London that noble Citie, Where they haue taken a godly ordre for a truth, God geue them the mindes the same to maintaine, For in the world is not a better ordre, Yf it may be Gods fauour still to remaine, Many good men will be in that bordre. Go out. Fortune. No Gods mercy, no reuerence, no honour, No cappe of, no knee bowed, no homage, Who am I? is there no more good manner, I trowe, you know not me, nor my lignage, I tell you I rule and gouerne all, I aduaunce and I plucke downe againe, Of him that of byrth is poore and small, As a noble man I can make to rayne, I am she that may do all thinges, In Heauen or earth who is like to me, I make captiues of Lordes and Kinges, Of captiues or fooles I make Kinges to be, No curtesy yet for all this power, I tell you learned men call me a goddesse, A beggar I make ritche in an hower, To such as I loue, I geue good successe, Who in this world can me withstand, Who can say yea, where I say nay, I chaunge all in the turning of a hand, What so euer I will do it I may, Haue I done nothing for any here, Haue I not one louer nor friende, None to welcome me with a mery chere, Now by my trouth you be vnkinde, Well I may chaunce some to displease, I purpose to dally and play a feate, Which shall turne some to small ease, A popish foole will I place in a wisemans seate By that you shall learne I trowe, To do your dutie to a lady so hye, He shall teach you fortune to knowe, And to honour hyr till you die. Incontinen. It is a world to see the fooles greedines, I haue nuseled him incarnalitie, A man would marueell to see his redines, Unto all fleshly sensualitie, And these harlots are not to learne, How to dally with a simple foole, They may leade him with a thred of yearne, Into the middest of a whyrle poole, He prayed me hether to decline, And looke diligentlie about, He is afrayd of discipline, And of exercitation no doubt, Neyther of them both can I see, I will returne and beare him worde, A glad man then will Moros be For them he feareth more then the sword. Semble a goyng out. Fortune. Whether now syra are you blinde, Am I so litle a moate that you cannot see, I will plucke downe your hie minde, And cause you I trow to know me. Inconti. I crie you mercie ladie most excellent, Without doubt I did not your honour beholde, O Empresse, O Goddesse omnipotent, I render you prayses manifolde. Fortune. Well at this time I holde you excused, Glad to see you do your dutie so well, If all other had them selues so vsed, It had been better for them, to you I may tell, I trow your name is incontinencie, One of the properties of Moros Incontinence. I see him geuen to insolencie, And I further him in that purpose, Lecherie is to fooles counaturall, Wise men thereof are euer ware, For they see that such vses bestiall, Bringe men to infamie, shame and care. Fortune. How vile so euer he be in condition, How foolish so euer and insipient, How full of pride so euer and ambition: How lecherous so euer and incontinent, It is notwithstanding our pleasure, To exalt him in honour and richesse, Wee will geue him laude, wealth, and treasure, And in all thinges therwith good successe: He loueth women I will giue him plentie, He loueth gay rayment, meates and drinkes fine, Of rayment he shall haue shiftes twentie? Store of Uenison, wildefoole, breade and wine, Moros shall lacke nothing for a season, They shall see that Fortune can exalte fooles, Who shall nurter men of wit and reason, And make them glad to learne theyr scholes, Seing that the vulgares will me not prayse, For exalting good men and sapient, I will gette me a name an other wayes, That is by erecting fooles insipient. Incontinence. Pleaseth it you to geue me licence. A fewe verses of a Poete to recite. Fortune. I will gladly here the Poetes sentence, Where as against me he doth not writte. Incontinence. Sed redeo ad stultos, quos quando extollit &amp; alto, Collocat in soleo, cupiens fortuna iocari, O quod stultitiis tunc omnia plena videbis. I come now to speake of fooles againe, With whom when it pleaseth Fortune to play, She extolleth and maketh to rayne, Ye and to them wise men to obey, O than with how many follies shalt thou se, All thinges filled and replenished, Which to rehearse long it would be, Yet of the Poete they be published, Dishonestie, mightelie, triumpheth than, Virtusque mouet contempta Cachinnum. Uertue is mocked of euery man, Then of hoores and harlots there is no small som, Nothing but eating, drinking, and play, Only voluptuousnes foolish and filthy, Encreaseth more and more day by day, And hath the rule in Realme and Citie. Fortune. And as the Poete writeth so shall it be, With Moros we will take such an order, That all thinges which for his pleasure he shall se, So let him commaund in euery border, You know where Moros we shall finde, We commaund you to lead vs to the place, And forasmuch as you occupie his minde, So teach him to know our Noble grace, For before that he doth againe appeare, An other manner of person we will him make, Yea, and wee will cause all persons farre and neare, As a worthie Gentleman him to take. Incontinencie. If it will please your grace to walke, I will bringe you where as Moros is. Fortune. Cum wayt vpon me, by the way wee will talke, Thou shalt se wonders after this. Go out both. Pietie. I am come hither now to complayne, Not only to see this foole thus to miscarie, Which vertuous Discipline doth disdayne, And to honestie is contrarie, But also of a great multitude, Which despise God and his Councell, As though there were no beatitude, No torments for sinne with Deuilles in Hell, I can say no more of Pietie, Then I haue said a litle before, Which is to serue Gods Maiestie, The same to loue, to feare, to honour, But now alas what manners, what heauy times, Pietie is vtterly extinguished, What contempt is there, what crimes, More mischiefe then can be published, And as Gods Maiestie is despised, So the loue among men doth abate, Neuer was there greater hatred deuised, Then is among men of euery estate, What falshood, what desceit and guile, What subtilties are of men inuented, Who doth not his body with sinne defile, Who is with his owne state contented, I haue redde of many worldes and seasons, Of so sinfull a world did I neuer read, About mischiefe men occupie their reasons, None other thing now a daies is in their head, Yet God hath sum good people I darre say, Which pray deuoutlie fast and abstaine, And call vpon him night and day, The wickednes of our times to restraine, And I doubt not for his owne name sake, He will subuert the workes of sinne, Which he graunt shortly to slake, And that vertue the victorie may winne. Wrath. Ha, ha, ha, I must laugh to see Fortunes daliance, Lord how she hath this foole enhaunced, The sporte is to see his countenance, This wealth hath to him straungly chaunced, But they say that fooles are fortunable, It appeareth to be the trew now indeede, Fortune hath made a foole honorable, And like more in honour to proceede, Now am I sent Officers to seke, Impietie, Crueltie, and Ignorance. I must trudge about all this weke, Not a litle vnto my hinderance. Pietie. Such a Master, such seruaunts in deede, O what a plage is it euermore, When vertuous men haue euell speede, And fooles haue ease, wealth and honour, Haue we not had manifest probation, Haue not men of God beene put to silence, And such fooles in whom was no good disputation, But altogether with Crueltie gaue they sentence. Wrath. Thou art one of them for whom I seke, Not for thy honour, but for thy decay, I haue commaundment to choppe thee as a leeke, If thou wilt not get the away, Wherfore be ruled by my Councell, Cum no more into Moros Companie, For both with shame he will expell, And put thee also to vilanie. Pietie. Better it is to meete a she Beare, When she is robbed of her whelpes, Then with a foole that rule doth beare, For nother reason nor learning will be his helpes. Wrath. No moe wordes but get the away at once, I am Wrath sone kindled and set on fire, Speake one worde and I will breake thy bones, And tread the downe here in the myre, Yea, I aduise thee, loe what wrath can do, To wrath place to geue he is glad, To fooles many are glad to leane to, For feare of theyr rage when they are made, Yonder cometh one that I seeke for, I am deceiued, if it be not the same, As he were blinde about he doth pore, Ignorance I suppose is his name. Ignorance. Is there any body here in this place, I am sent for in all the hast I weene, I am commaunded to come away apace, They will maruell where so long I haue beene, Wrath. Whether should you go I pray you frend, And who is it that for you did send. Ignorance. Lady Fortune did tell me her minde, And to speake with Moros I do intend. Wrath. To tarry here if you will take the paine, Moros will come hether anone: Where impietie is I would know fayne, And where I should speake with him alone. Ignorance. Crudelitie, Impietie, and I, Were coming all three together, I thinke verily that they are passed by, And gone euen the right way thether. Wrath. What are theyr names when they come there, What do you call Impietie. Ignorance. Philosophie his name his euery where, Crudelitie, Prudence, and I Antiquitie. Wrath. Uery well I am glad of this in deede, By reason hereof my Iornie is at an ende, I purpose no further to proceede, To returne againe I do intende, I will cause Moros to make hast, Antiquitie tarrieth for you, I will say. Ignorance. Yea and though the time be somwhat past, Tell him that I did not well know the way, Go out. Wrath. Ignorance. Ignorance yea Ignorance is my name, A meete mate with fooles to dwell, A qualitie of an auncient fame, And yet drowne I many one in hell, The Papistes which the truth do know, Lord how I haue nuseled them in my science. I haue so taught them, that how so euer the wind blow, They shall still encline to my sentence, So that though they haue knowledge and cunning, They are but Ignoraunt and fooles, After euery Heresie and Poperie, they are running, And delight daily to learne at newe scholes, Also many that do them selues abuse, Some in that Iniquitie and some in this, By Ignorance they do them selues excuse, As though they know not that they did amisse, When theyr conscience beare them record, That theyr actes are wicked and euill, Therfore when they shall come before the Lord, He shall condemne them with Satan the Deuill. Moros. Entre Gaily disguised and with a foolish beard. A Syr, my beard is well growne, I thought that I should be a man ones, Yea a Gentleman, and so will I be knowne, A man of honour both body and bones, How say you my Councellours tell me, Haue I not a Gentlemans countenance. Impietie. A better face truly I did neuer se, Nor a better legge in my remembraunce. Crueltie. Yf you had not bene comly and wise, Fortune would not haue so fauored you: You muste appeare to be straunge and nyse, That will cause men humbly to bowe. Ignorance. Goddes deintye, is this Master Moros. A propre Gentleman by saint Anne, To dwell with your maship I purpose, And to do you the best seruice that I can. Impietie. This is an other of your Councell, Whose name is called Antiquitie: His wordes are trewer then the Gospell, A person full of truth and fidelitie. Moros. You are welcome gentle sanguinitie, A Syr? is sanguinitie your name. Crudelitie. He is called auncient antiquitie, A person of good stocke and great fame. Moros. Welcome againe then gentle tandiditie, And you are welcome all three indeeee. Pild lousy boy Fippence and tandiditie, How do you welcome all good speede. Impietie. Forsoth I am called Philosophie, Prudence is this mans name doubtlesse: Antiquitie he is called verilie, As here after we shall more plainly expresse. Moros. Pild lousy boy Fippence and tandiditie, You are welcome, you come to wayte one me. Ignorance. Yea and to serue you with all humilitie, And to fulfill your requestes redy to be. Impietie. Fortune appointed me to be gouernour, Of your owne person you to directe: And to conuince euery vaine troubler, Which shall presume your minde to infecte. Crudelitie. And me she appointed them to correct, Which should do ought against your minde, Yea and your profites and rents to collect, And to seke narowly where we may them finde. Ignorance. I am ordeined alway to giue you warning, Of exercitation in any science: Lesse you hurt your wittes with learning, And dull your vnderstanding and science. Moros. Shall I tell you there was one pynuttre, Who a while had me in his handling, He was vp with God and holy diuintre, But I was sone wery of his wandling, And that curst hooreson Diricke Quintine, Would beate me shrewdly by Gods Passion, He went about me to famish and pine, Through one arse out of fashion. I shall desire you pild lousy boy, And you Fippence and tandiditie, Them to bannish and vtterly destroye, For I feare their crudelitie. Impietie. Feare? and you a man of nobilitie, Remember that you are come to manhood. Crudelitie. Hath not Fortune set you in authoritie, With your owne hand let their hart bloode. Moros. Body of God giue me my sworde, Hart, woundes, I will kill them by and by. Armes and sides I haue spoken the worde, His bloud and bones they shall die, Am I in authoritie do you say, May I hang, burne, head and kill, Let them be sure I will do what I may, I will be knowne in authoritie that I will. Impietie. Pietie, Discipline, and Exercitation, Meane you not them I pray you. Moros. They indeede haue put me to tribulation, But I trow I will trouble them againe now. Body of God am I in authoritie, I will burne them, hang them, &amp; boyle them, As many as once professe pietie, If I may know it I will turmoyle them. Impietie. Of God indeede many of them talke, And of the soule, and of Heauen and Hell, But from you as fooles let them walke, They speake of a thing wherof they can not tell, I am named Philosophie, The knowledge of all thinges I do containe, In me is Astronomie and Astrologie, The truth of all thinges in me do remaine, I can teach you Heauen to know, Which they call a Sphericall figure, More perfight then any other hye or lowe, Eternall forsoth in his owne nature, Also how that the world was made, In the middest of the sayd Heauen, How v. sonnes deuide it in theyr trade, Of the Sicles and Epicicles seuen, Of mouing and quiet I can teache, Of matter and forme I can tell goodly geare, Such as go vp into pulpettes and preache, Especially these newe felowes, to them geue no eare, Nay then, wheras you haue authoritie, Suffer them not in any wise to dwell, Be bold to punish them with austeritie, For it is but all Heresie that they do tell, Goodly doctrines I can teach you of nature, And how it bringeth forth nothing perfightly, Without Art this is a doctrine sure, Also how the same worketh secretly, Now such as of God to you will talke, Of Heauen, Hell, or of the soule, From your presence bid them walke, Yea though they alledge Christ and Poule, Concerning those thinges I am appointed, To bring you into the veritie, Endeuer your selfe to be acqueinted, With your Noble Counceller Antiquitie From time to time euermore still, He shall in your companie remaine, Prudence shall get in, poll and pill, For euermore seeke for your gayne. Moros. You are a cunning person I see that, Would to God you had a better name, Pild lousy boy, fye that is to flatte, And to call you Fippence it is a shame. Ignorance. His name I tell you is Philosophie, In whom is contained all science, Antiquitie is my name verilye, And this person is called Prudence. Moros. Gods blessinge on your harts all I shall remember your names I trowe: My seruants by theyr names I will call, If my beard a litle longer would growe. I doubt not but as you grow in age, So you will encrease in sapience: You shall neuer want a witty page, To sharpen your intelligence. Ignorance. With all your affaires let vs alone, Geue you your minde to pleasure, Eate, drinke, dally and play with Ione, Wee will maintaine your state with treasure, Sum will moue you to reade Scripture, Sum would haue you seen in Stories, Sum to feates of armes will you allure, All these are but plaine vaine glories, Mary I woud haue you seene in cardes and dise, As you shalbe I trow with in a while, We trust to make you in them so wise, That none shalbe able you to begile. Crueltie. You must set your selfe forth with the best, You must learne to haue a diuerse countenance, Frowning when a thing you shall detest, Pleasant when ought is for your furtheraunce, So, lo, that is well when you are angrie, Metely well to when you are pleased, A smiling countenance you must carie, When your conceit is in all thinges eased. Impietie. By my trouth wot you like whom he doth looke, He is as like a cosin of mine as euer I did see. Crueltie. That he is like him in face you may sweare on a booke And also his conditions with his, do well agree, As touching all godlines a foole he was, But in filthy demeanour who was worse, Out of doubt in sinne he did so excell and passe, That the whole countrie for him God did curse. Ignorance. Leaue I pray you Syrs what needeth this clatter, You talke sir me thinke you wot not what: I pray you go forward with our matter, If you know any waies for our masters profit speake that. Crueltie. To prouide thinges to come by Policie, I will worke vnder such a pretence, That all thinges shall appeare honestlie, And for that cause am I named Prudence, Againe in prouiding your necessaries, I will in such a sort canuas the lawe, That such as be your aduersaries, Shalbe brought to Corum and awe. Moros. O who hath such seruants as I haue, So learned, so wise, in Hall and in Schole, Among them all, there is not one Knaue, So that it skilleth not though I be a foole: Would to God I had my seruaunts together, Pastime, Pleasure, and Robinhoode, I pray you take paine to call them hether, To haue them wait me it should do me good. Impietie. You know the names of all your seruaunts, It may please you them here to recite, Wee must also know the names of your tenaunts, That in your bookes of accomptes we may them write. Moros. Pild lousy boy you are the best, None of them better then you none so good, Fippence and Tandiditie be nexte, Pastime, Pleasure, and Robinhoode, Here be six honest persons indeede, By saint Malkin it is an honest traine, You shall haue all one liuery and weede, For you all intend my profit and gaine. Crueltie. To the draper I will go and bye cloth, And aray all your seruaunts in a liuery: To wait on you otherwise I would be loth, That wil be Gentlemanlike verily. Impietie. The great affaires I do consider, That Prudence in other thinges must haue, It is best therfore that wee go together, So shall we be sure money to saue, And here we leaue auncient Antiquitie, A person that no bad Councell will geue, He is prudent and full of sagacitie, His councell se that you do beleue. Moros. I haue seruaunts that finely can sing, Let me here I pray you, what you can do, Singing and playing I loue aboue all thing, Let me here you, I pray you, go to. Ignorance. I am old and my voice is rustie, Yet I will sing to do you pleasure. Moros. We will haue drinke if you be thurstie, For I loue to drinke without measure. Ignorance. You must beginne for I can no skill, Yet I will iumble on as well as I can, Crueltie. We are indifferent, sing what ye will, We were brought vp with a singing man. Impietie. We take our leaue of you for this season, Sing some mery song. In time we shall wayte on you againe. Crueltie. To haue a time it standeth with reason, In order to set among your traine. Moros. In my house you will appoint me Officers, Such as shall bring in to make frolicke chere, But those that of Discipline and Pietie are folowers, I would haue rooted out both farre and nere, Fare ye well: as soone as you can returne, For I can do nothing without your councell. Impietie. He that speaketh one word against you, we wil burne Hang or heade him like a rebell. Go out both. Moros. Yea mary Syr this doth me good at the hart, Fare ye well, worthy to serue a Gentleman. Ignorance. I tell you they were not brought vp at the Cart, Full worshipfully their curtesy they can: Now Syr, tell me how feele you your stomacke, Are you disposed to play, eate, or drincke, Tell me if there be any thing that you lacke, Deuise what ye wil, and in minde do ye thinke, You shall haue it what so euer it doth cost, We will neither passe of wind nor wether. Moros. By my trouth the thing that I desire most, Is in my cappe to haue a goodly feather. Ignorance. A feather: a matter of great importaunce, You shal haue a feather if it cost a pounde Looke vp lustelie, vse a gentlemans countenance, And a feather I trowe for you shall be found. Moros. A feather would make me looke a loft, Haue you one? what a redde one? Now I thanke you, it is goodly stoft, This will make me a Gentleman alone, Make it fast I pray you in my cappe, Now by my honour I thanke you hartelie, This will beare away a good rappe, As good as a sallet for me verilie, I looke vpward now alwaie still, Goddes daies my feather I can not see, Of this Feather I can no skill, Beshrew thy hart, I haue hurt my knee. Looke vpward to see the fether. Stumble and fall. Like the Philosopher that looked so hie, So long that he fell into the myre, Also an other that gased so into the skie, Till he fel grouelinges in the fire, For a gentleman to looke hie it is meete, But in all thinges there is a meane, It becommeth you to take heede to your fete, Lesse you make your garments foule and vncleane. Moros. A vengeance take this foolish feather, While it is there I can not looke downe. Ignorance. Fie, fie, you should haue said so rather, Looke here how vnseemelie, you weare your geare, See, See, it hangeth all on the one side, And your sword is betwene your legges, Wise men will you mocke and deride, And not set by you a coupple of egges, Let me helpe you to set your gowne right, On this fascion your sword you must weare, A lacke, a lacke, if I had a good sight, I woulde trim you in your geare. Moros. Must I not looke ouer my shoulder somtime, I haue seene some that thus would iette. Ignorance. To be equall with the best do you cline, Remember still that in honour you are set, Here entreth Discipline. The longer thou liuest the more foole thou art. Euery day more foole then other, Thou wilt play such a foolish part, As shall shame countrey, father and mother, Good audience, note this fooles proceding, In tendre age, in Idlenes he was nuseled, In adolencie when Pubes was fpringing, Touching vertue, as a dogge that is museled, Yll willing to learne and therfore vnapt, All his senses he applied to vice, Anone with such companions he was wrapt, As no yong man will be that is wise, Neuer could I bring him to Pietie, That is God to serue, to loue, to feare, Neither to do ought for his owne vtilitie, Neither reuerence in his hart to beare, But as fooles all are vnpatient, So was he geuen to hastines and yre, In lecherie as fooles be all incontinent, Through Idlenes he was set on fire, When to mans state ones he attained, Worldly Fortune did him in wealth erect, God and good Councell he disdained, Being then with all miserie infecte, Now is he come vnto plaine Impietie, Which perswadeth him God to denie, And with him is ioyned Crudelitie, Against the innocents to replie, Behold here he is ledde with Ignorance, So that he will not beleue the veritie, Beside these he hath other mainteinance, To vpholde him in his iniquitie, Of suche the Prophete did Prophecie, The foole saith in his hart there is no god, Corrupt are they and full of villanie, Therfore shall they be beate with an yron rodde. Moros. Can you tell of whom this tale they haue told, I am a man he knoweth me not now. Ignorance. Tush, face him out, feare not be bold, For all this talke he hath of you. Moros. Syra, shall I drawe my sword or daggar, It is not best to kill him out of hand. Ignorance. Tush you are but a craking braggar, I would se you boldly him to withstand. Moros. Would to God that pild lousy boy were here, Good Lord what meaneth my man Robinhoode. Ignorance. Are you afrayde for very shame draw nere, I would let out sum of his sawsie blood. Moros. Good man you, know you who I am, My beard is growne I am a man now, You shall repent that hether you came, I will kill you I make God auow, A vengeaunce on it, my daggar will not out, Syr I pray you how my hand doth quake, Rayle on mee you beggarly loute, You and I afray will make, Am I not a Gentleman knaue, Body of God will you presume, Truly Tandiditie no power I haue, So great is my angre and fume. Discipline. A foole vttereth his angre in hast, And hath not the wit measure to keepe, Where much angre is, strength is past, And wisdom is drowned in folly deepe, As fayer legges to a cripple are vnseemelie, So to a foole honor is vndecent: As snow in haruest is vntimelie, So is it a plague where a foole is regent, What should a foole do with money or treasure, Seing that Sapience he can not bye, In voluptuousnes he walloweth without measure, As a beastly swine doth in his filthie stye. Moros. Body of God for angre I am like to die, Where is Robinhoode and pild lousy boy, Callest thou me foole, I vtterlie thee defie, Thee and all thine, this sword shall vtterlie destroie, Plucke out my sword good Tandiditie, Passion of God, kill him downe right. Ignorance. He should not long liue in tranquilitie, If I had my perfight senses and sight, But be you ruled by my Councell, For this time let vs depart and geue place, We shall send them hether that shall him compell, To holde his peace, yea, spite of his face. Moros. Content, content, we will go hence in deede, We will send to you ere it be long, Alas where be my seruaunts in time of neede, This tough horesun for me is to stronge. Go out both. Discipline. As scripture calleth this the hiest sapience, God to know, to feare, to loue, and obey, And the most pure and high intelligence, Is to follow his precepts night and day, So God to contempne, to despise, to hate, Is such a folly as none is more extreme, This is the most miserable state, Yea, no state at all as wise men do esteme, When a foole is compassed with Impietie, Which is the contempt of God and his ordinaunces, And such a foole erected to authoritie, The people must needes sustaine many greuaunces. For there God can not be duly honored, His holy Sacraments had in estimation, Neither the publique weale rightly gouerned, But all commeth to vtter dissipation, If we should say all that might be said, Of fooles in their extreme folly, How Goddes people by them haue decaied, Two daies would not serue I thinke truly. Go out. Here entreth People. Intollerabilius nil est quÃ m diues auarus, QuÃ m stultus locuples, quÃ m Fortunatus iniquus. There is nothing more intollerable, Then a ritch man that is couetouse, A foole wealthy, a wicked man fortunable, A Iudge perciall, an old man lecherous, Good Lord how are we now molested, The deuill hath sent one into our countrie, A monstre whom God and man hath detested, A foole that came vp from a lowe degre, My name is people, for I represent All the people where Moros doth dwell, Such a person as is with nothing content, So that we thinke him to be a deuill of hell, Neyther learning, wisdom nor reason Will serue where he taketh opinion, His wordes and actes be al out of season, By honest men he setteth not an Oynion, And as he is such is his familie, Not one honest person, among them I do knowe, Ruffians, vilaynes, swerers, full of blasphemie, Despysers of all honest men, both hye and lowe, A whole Alphabete of his officers I can recyte though it be not in ordre, A rable of Roysterly ruffelers, Which trouble al honest men in our borders, As for Impietie, Crueltie, and Ignorance, Are cheif of his counsell verily, Idlenes, wrath, and lecherous dalliance, Are they which in youth kept him company, Syr Anthony Arrogant Auditour, Bartilmew brybor, Bayly, Clement Catchpole, Cofferer, Diuision double faced dauie, Edmund enuiouse chiefe of the Eawery, Fabian falshode his head farmer, Gregory gorbely the goutie, Gouerneth the grayne in the garner, Haunce Haserder the horsekeper is, Iames the iust is the cheife Iudge, Leonard Lecherous is man of law, I wisse, Kenolme the knaue is in cokery no drudge, Martin the murtherer maister of musicke, Nicoll neuer thrift, the Notary, Owen ouerwhart, Master in Phisicke, Quintine the quaffer, for nothing necessary, Rafe Ruffian, the rude raylour, Steuen sturdy Master Suruayer, Thomas the theefe, his cheefe tailour, William witlesse, the great warriour, With these and such like many moe, We in his circuit be oppressed, For remedie wee wot not whether to goe, To haue our calamitie redressed, Unto God only wee referre our cause, Humbly we commit all to his iudgment, Wee haue offended him and his holy lawes, Therfore are wee worthy of this punishment. Go out. Moros. Entre Furiousely with a gray beard. Where is he, blood, sides, hart and woundes, A man I am now, euery inch of mee, I shall teach the knaue, to kepe his boundes, What his pratling will proffit I will see, With me to come I would not suffer one, Yet, seruaunts I haue and that plentie, I my selfe, I trow am good inough alone, Yea, by the Masse if there were twentie, Make no more a do but fend thy heade, Haue at thee, thou shalt know that I am a man, Fight alone. I will make the that thou shalt eat no more breade, Rayle no more at Master Moros than, What there, eyther I haue him slaine, Entre with a terrible visure. Or elles from my sight he is fledde, He is neuer like to trouble me againe, I warrent him I haue brought him in bedde. Gods Iudgm?t The longer thou liuest, the more foole thou art, This to the hath been often recited, For so much as thou hast playd, such a fooles part, As a foole thou shalt be iustly requited, I represent Gods seuere iudgement, Which dallieth not where to strike he doth purpose, Hether am I sent to the punishment, Of this impious foole here called Moros, Who hath sayd there is no God in his hart, His holy lawes, he had stoutly blasphemed, Godly Discipline could neuer his mind conuart, Uertue nor honestie are not of him estemed. Moros. A Pestilence take them horesun knaues, They are euer absent when I haue neede, Horesunnes bring your clubbes, billes, bowes, &amp; staues, I see that it is time now to take heede. Gods Iudgm?t According vnto his most wicked beleue, So with his neighbours wickedly he dealeth, From the poore he doth take and nothing doth geue, He oppresseth, brybeth, defraudeth, and stealeth, If he beleued God, good workes to rewarde, And Deuilles wickednes to punish in fire, His promises and threates he would more regard, Do penance and for mercy desire, But such fooles in their harts do say, That there is no God, neyther Heauen, nor Hell, According to their saying they follow that way, Like as a litle before I did tell, For as much as vengeance to God doth belong, And hee will the same recompence, That he is a God of power, mightie and strong, The fooles shall know by experience, With this sword of vengeance I strike thee, Strike Moros, and let him fall downe. Thy wicked Howsehold shalbe dispersed, Thy children shalbe rooted out to the fourth degree, Like as the mouth of God hath rehersed. Moros. Eyther I haue the falling sickenes, Or elles with the Palsey I am striken: I feele in my selfe no manner of quickenes, I beginne now straungly to sicken. Gods Iudgm?t If thou hast grace for mercy now call, Yet thy soule perchaunce thou maist saue: For his mercy is aboue his workes all, On penitent sinners he is wont mercy to haue. Moros. It was but a qualme came ouer my hart, I lacke nothing but a cuppe of good Wine. Gods Iudgm?t Indurate wretches can not conuert, Entre Confusion with an ill fauoured visure, &amp; all thinges beside ill fauoured. But die in their filthines like swine. Behold here cometh shame and Confusion, The reward of such wicked fooles all: To all the world shall appeare thy abusion, Thy wickednes, and false beleue to great and small. Moros. Here is an ill fauoured knaue by the Masse, Get the hence theefe with a wanion. Gods Iudgm?t This is the reward of such a foolish Asse, For euermore he shalbe thy companion. Confusion. The wise shall haue honour in possession, Thus the wise King Salomon doth say: But the portion of fooles is Confusion, Which abideth with them for euer and aye. Gods Iudgm?t Confusion spoyle him of his aray, Geue him his fooles coate for him due: His chayne and his staffe take thou away, In sorow and care for euer let him rue. Moros. Am I a sleepe, in a dreame, or in a traunce, Euer me thinke that I should be waking: Body of God this is a wonderfull chaunce, I can not stand on my feete for quaking. Confusion. As the eares of an Asse appeared in Midas, Though it were long er it were knowne, So at length euermore it cometh to passe, That the folly of fooles is openlie blowne, And then in this world they haue confusion, That is reprofe, derision, and open shame, And when they haue ended all their abusion, They leaue, behind them an abhominable name, Come foolish Moros, come go with me, And I shall bring thee to a shamefull ende, Thy malice will not let the, thy foly to see, So that thou hast not the grace, thy life to amend. Moros. Sancti, Amen, where is my goodly geare, I see well that I was a sleepe indeede, What am I faine a fooles coate to weare, Wee must learne at Christ crosse me speede, Other I was a Gentleman and had seruauntes, Or els I dreamed that I was a Gentleman. Confusion. But thou art now a pesant of al pesantes, A derision and mocke to Man and Woman, Cum forth of thy folly to receiue thy hyre, Confusion, pouertye, sickenes, and punishment, And after this life eternall fyre, Due for fooles that be impenitent. Moros. Go with thee ill fauoured knaue, I had leuer thou wert hanged by the necke, If it please the Deuill me to haue, Let him carry me away on his backe. Confusion. I will carry thee to the Deuill in deede, The world shalbe well ridde of a foole. Moros. A dew to the Deuill God send vs good speede, An other while with the Deuill I must go to schole. Gods Iudgm?t. For sinne though God suffreth Impietie, Greatly to the dishonour of his name, Yet at length he throweth downe Iniquitie, And putteth the Authours therof to shame, So confounded he tyrantes in times past, Whom holy Scripture fooles doth call, For as beastes here their times they did wast, And from our wickednes to an other did fall, What shall we neede their names to recite, Seing that euery man hath of them heard, In our times we haue knowne fooles full of spite, And in this world haue seene their reward, Wee do not only them fooles call here, Which haue not the perfight vse of reason, Innocents wherof be many farre and nere, In whom discretion is geason, But those are the greatest fooles properly, Which disdaine to learne sapience, To speake, to do, to worke, all thinges orderly, And as God hath giuen intelligence, But contrarie to nature and Gods will, They stoppe their eyes through wilfull Ignorance, They seke to slea, to prison, to pole, to pill, Only for their owne furtherance, Of all fooles indeede this is the worst kinde, Wherof this time we haue treated, Which to all mischiefe geueth his minde, And refuseth to be instructed, Many thinges moe of fooles we could talke, But we haue detained long our audience, An other way I am compelled to walke, Entre all .iii. Desiring you a while to haue patience. Go out. Exercitation. Although this foole of whom we haue spoken, Hath refused all honest exercise, Yet the harts of wisemen God doth open, Uertuouse occupation not to despise, For vndoubtedly it is as hard as they say, To get the scepter out of the hand of Hercules, As for one to be well occupied night or day, That is nuseled in vnhappy Idlenes, For as Theophilactus doth write, Idlenes hath taught all iniquitie, And as Ezechiel also doth recite, Idlenes taught the Sodomites impietie, Neuer will I beleue that man good to be, Whether he be of the Clergie or Lay, Whom Idle and not well occupied I see, Which do nothing but eate, drinke, and play. Pietie. We desire no man here to be offended, In that we vse this terme Pietie, Which is despised and vily pended, Of sinners and Authours of Iniquitie, For the Heathen Philosophers and Oratours, Used the same terme and in the same sence, Learned Christians true worshippers, Created of Pietie with his science, Plato, Aristotle, Valerius, and Tully, Wrote of Pietie and diuerse other, And called it an honour due to God only, And a naturall dutie to Father and Mother, Saint Augustine in his booke of Gods citie, And in other Noble works that he did make, Treateth holily of this terme Pietie, And as he doth take it, so do we it take, Ipsa est illa sapientia quÃ¦ Pietas vocatur, Qua colitur Pater luminum: A quo est omne datum optimum. That is the hiest sapience notified, Which is called Pietie in deede, Wherby the Father of light is worshipped, From whom euery good gift doth proceede. Discipline. Touching my person called Discipline, In the processe, I haue said sufficient, Yet to ende with some honeste doctrine, You shall here a learned mans iudgement, There be many Disciplines as Authours do say, Among all, there be two principall, That be Scire &amp; Sapere alway, To haue cunning and wisdom withall. Exercitation. Vt fluuiosus habens gladium, sic doctus iniquus. Without faile this is a notable verse, I would all men could it well by roate, The sentence therof Salomon doth reherse, I wishe all the audience it to noate, A wicked man hauing learning and cunning, And doth many sciences vnderstand, Is like one whose wittes are running, I meane a madde man hauing a sword in his hand. Pietie. For a madde man hauing in his hand edge toole, Seketh both him selfe and other to kill, So a cunning man without wisdom is but a foole, For both him selfe and many other he doth spill, Wherfore who so euer hath intelligence, Let him humblie desire of God euermore, That he will also geue him sapience, To bestowe his cunning to his honour. Discipline. This is the sum of the hole intent, To induce youth to these two aforesaide, Scire &amp; Sapere you know what is ment, Then many thinges amisse shalbe well staide. Exercitation. To learne many thinges, and many thinges to know, Then to haue wisdom the same to direct, These be two Disciplines meete for hye and lowe, Which to all vertues do the minde erect. Pietie. For this time wee haue sayd sufficient, With Scire and Sapere we make an ende, Beseching our Lord God omnipotent, That among vs his grace he may sende. Discipline. And here we make an ende trusting that all you present Will beare vs recorde that no estate we defame: To prayse the good order, now set is our intent, And to further the glory of Gods holy name. Exercitation. God saue the Queenes Highnes, and the Nobilitie, Defend her long we beseeche thee Lorde: Which is the Patronesse of all humilitie, A setter forth of truth, and louer of concord. Pietie. God preserue the Queenes most honorable Councell, With all the Magistrates of this Region, That they may agree to maintaine Gods Gospell, Which is the most true and sincere Religion, To roote out Antechrist I pray God they may take payne Then will the Lord send them honour and fame, And after this life, geue them the reward of the same. Discipline. Pray wee for the Clergie and hole Spiritualtie, That they may teach and set forth Gods truth alway, I beseeche you, let vs pray for the hole communaltie, That vpon vs all, God mercy take may, So that eche one of vs, in the right way may staye, All glory, honour, impery, maiestie, and dignitie, Be geuen both now &amp; euermore to the blessed Trinitie.
