      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. Scene.âAn apartment in the Palace of the Pharaohs at Memphis. Architecture Egyptian; a table on one side, and near it a sofa. Daybreak. Rameses III. discovered lying on a sofa; enter to him Osmandyas. Osmand. I'm here, dear brother; and may I inquire What pressing business, what grave interests Have made you ask ere daybreak for your slave? What enterprises, or what perils, pray Can trouble thus the rest of Egypt's king? Is it that you're fatigued with royal pomp, With all the quietude of peace at home, And are already planning in your brain New conquests,âvisions of extended sway; Or have you,âfortunately warn'd in time,â Discover'd treason plotting 'gainst your life? You answer not?âyour cheek is wet with tears, And smother'd sobs betray your agony. Oh, tell me, pray, the secret of your woe! King. Alas, the vanity, the nothingness Of regal pow'r;âlike Sodom's baneful fruit All fair without, and ashes all within! Had I my choice,âthough king and conqueror, Before whose throne a hundred nations bow, Whose mighty arm has fearlessly subdued The sable denizens of Nubia And Dongola, above the cataracts, Before whose image incense-burning priests Pay honours due to Deity alone;â Had I my choice, I say, I'd give up all,â My martial glory and my treasured wealth, My kingdom, too, the fairest 'neath the sun,â All this, and more I'd cheerfully give up, Could I but one short night of sleep enjoy. Osmand. What means your Majesty by such discourse,â So strange, so wild, and so unwonted? Speak! King. Oh, would I were an humble fisherman, Whose cares are measured by his evening toil Of spreading nets across the flooding Nile! Then would I heedless let my little bark Float freely down the stream, and listless lie Gazing on nature's measureless expanse. At night, too, when return'dâmy labours o'er, A shady fragrant bow'r would ope its doors And show within a smiling, loving wife, Anxious for my appearance,âchildren, too, Ruddy with health, but buried all in sleep. Oh yes;âfor then, however poor and mean, I should enjoy the bliss of being loved. Osmand. To what strange fancies are you yielding, Sire? What,âyou, a king, whose brows a sacred crown Encircles,âyou, before whose regal throne Thousands on thousands bow,âyou envy thus The fortune of the poorest in your realm! Till now I thought, as well in sooth I might, That you were not less happy than renown'd; In fact, that ne'er sat monarch on a throne More happy,âas a husband, or a sire. King. But what, if all my miseries, my woes, Result from these same dear domestic ties? Osmand. What mean you, Sire? King. Come,âsit you down awhile, And let me now unveil to you the thoughts Which I am tired of hiding in my breast. A few days since, to Memphis I return'd In triumph (I had been three years away), With all the dazzling pomp of martial pride; Ten captive kings chain'd to my chariot-wheels, Surrounded by their weeping families; And at each step gay flowers deck'd my path, While joyous shouts of greeting rent the air From nobles, priests, and people,âall alike. For me, I listless gazed upon the crowd, Rapt in the prospect of more real bliss When I should once more clasp within my arms The Queenâmy wifeâand my beloved boy. At length, with straining eyes I spied the Queen, And never did I feel my heart so throb As when I gazed upon that peerless form, That beauteous face of queenlike loveliness. I flew to meet her: judge of my surprise! No joyous outburst greeted me, no kiss, No fond embrace: her smile was icy-cold, And all her words were measured and restrain'd; She stammer'd, seem'd confused, nay, even blush'd, And trembled, as she led to me my boy. Osmand. Might I presume, your most devoted slave, T' interpret this constraint, a few brief words Will serve t' explain the conduct of the Queen. On leaving, Sire, your love entrusted her And placed entirely under her control Your kingdom and your people's destinies, To govern them as you had done yourself. Nitocris is of proud Assyrian blood, Right royal blood,âambitious too, And fond of exercising queenly sway. When she had once enjoy'd the power, then 'T was natural she should leave it with regret. Ere now, Sire, women have, as sovereigns, Govern'd the world, and haply may again; As, after Ninus, did Semiramis. King (sighing). Ah! what a melancholy tale is thine! The Queen is troubled then at my return:â Nay, more;âwhile I've been toiling in the war, And conquering our foes in Nubia, Brought home, moreover, twenty vanquish'd kings To offer them as presents at her feet, She meanwhile wish'd for me but shame and death, Cursing the Providence that guarded me, And impiously pray'd I might be slain. Good cause in sooth was there for such a wish; For she had brought dishonour on my name, By calling to her bed a paramour, Whose base-born sonâin secret by her rear'dâ Will some day after her ascend the throne. Osmand. Wretch!âwhy not send him to immediate death? King. That were a thankless task:âI could not! 'faith: For, suddenly oppress'd with shame and grief, My senses left me:âthen, when I revived And could have visited the criminal With punishment condign, I still refused, Thinking he might be but the humble tool Of some more cunning, more designing foe. What matters? I have drunk life's poison-cup E'en to the dregs, and care not now to live. Besides,âthe Gods have will'd I shall not sleep; And nightly am I haunted by dark dreams And visions, far too horrid to describe;â So I've just ask'd the priests t' interpret them, And soonâfor I behold the eastern gleam That heralds sunriseâthey'll their answer bring. Meanwhile Nitocris, seized with just alarm, Strives, though in vain, to penetrate my soul, Cunningly watching ev'ry look and word, Nay, shedding tears of well-affected grief, As though she were a loving, loyal wife. But still, however just my wrath may be, I cannot on a bare suspicion slay The partner of my throne. Her beauty, youth, and birth,â My weakness, too,âalike restrain my hand From striking her, as her misdeeds deserve. But were a single proof to be alleged, The smallest clue, whereby to trace the crime, I'd instantly forget all former love, And bare my arm such vengeance to inflict As would strike terror through the universe. Which done,âmy fury quell'd,âI'll abdicate The Pharaohs' throne, and to some distant land Unhonour'd, unanneal'd, retire to die. Osmand. Some one approaches, Sire;ârestrain yourself:â The priests are come to pay you homage due. King. Beware; let not the secret slip your tongue. I'll conceal the man beneath the king. Enter Priests, followed by Nitocris and Ladies. King. Thrice honour'd priests, high favourites of Heav'n, Of whose great laws you are th' interpreters; The main support of kings and judges too, Who by your words illuminate their minds, Shedding around a midday brilliance; Whose eyes, too, pierce the sable veil of night, And read the future in the twinkling stars;â Have you not yet interpreted my dream? 1st Priest. May your designs, O King, be ever blest, And may your doors be closed against all ill! [Bows to the ground, then resumes. I have, obedient to your high behests, Lit up before th' Egyptian Apis' shrine The fragrant incense, which refused to burn; Ill omen! Next, we counsel sought of heav'n And all its host; when, lo, your star we saw Detach itself and rush across th' expanse, Marking its passage by a train of gold That lighted up all heav'n with brilliance, And then beneath th' horizon sank in gloom. Something portentous, strange, and terrible, Foreshadow'd seems in your mysterious dream: In fact, some direful peril we announce, But whatâor whence inflictedâwe know not. King. A pit then yawns for me, beneath my feet; But what hand is it that directs the work? (To Queen.) Do you know, Madam, whom I have to fear? Nitocris. What enemy can trouble you, my liege? Who dares defy the lightning of your eye, The thunder of your voice? Some silly dream Has weigh'd your spirits down: but why thus fear, So long as it cannot be understood? Your priests,âyour prophets too,âI grieve to see, Cannot interpret these dark presages. Methinks, though, mighty monarch, I could find A gifted seer:âa prisoner of war he is,â A youthful Jew; and he'll the riddle solve, If you'll admit him to an audience. His nation all admire his skillâhis gifts;â Nor does his voice e'er prophesy in vain, For it is deem'd an echo sent from Heav'n. 1st Priest. No lower int'rest guides us, gracious Queen, Than a regard for great Rameses' fame, And the prosperity of Egypt's realm. I hope, indeed, this Jew may calm your fears, And fathom these dark visions of our King. It is to Heaven, I grant, that he ascribes His knowledge:âbut what title has his God To be accredited by us or you? Can lowly Judah venture to compete With Egypt's world-renown'd philosophy? And shall our deep-learn'd priests be forced to bow Before a God whose power they deny? King. When lost,âalone,âamid the gloom of night, We step, uncertain what path to pursue, To reach, unharm'd and safe, our journey's end, We eagerly accept of any aid, However mean the hand that offers it. The wise have fail'd; let's try th' unlearned now. Where is this slave? let him be brought forthwith. Nitoc. Since early dawn, by my express command, Pahiroth has been waiting at your gates. King (to an officer). Hear you? Go, lead the Jewish pris'ner in! [Seats himself on his throne; Nitocris and Priests, etc., standing on either side. Rachel (going to front, aside). Lord of my fathers, through whose mighty wrath Thy favour'd people have been captive led Among the children of idolatry, Deign now to give Pahiroth skill And vindicate the honour of thy name: Go with thy prophet, speaking by his mouth, And give him with yon proud blaspheming king The same high honours Joseph once enjoy'd. [Retires to side of throne, behind Nitocris. Enter a train of Courtiers, then Pahiroth. Osmand. With downcast eyes, respectful mien approach! The great Rameses, Egypt's far-famed king, Admits thee to his presence; let prudence wing thy words! A dream disturbs him; canst interpret it? Pahiroth. I will, great monarch, if but Heav'n permit! 1st Priest. Dost never speak then, save when Heav'n inspires? Pahir. What can I say, save as the oracle of Heav'n? Let the King speak: I'll answer, if I may. King. Pris'ner,âthe dream that troubled me is this:â From out the centre of our earth rose up In lonely majesty a stately tree, Whose shadow from th' Equator to the Poles Extended; while its branches, tow'ring high, Reach'd to the starry canopy of heav'n, And its wide-spreading, massy root embraced With countless arms the kernel of the earth. Among its branches, clothed with foliage And teeming too, with fruit, perch'd countless birds, Who there had built their nests and rear'd their young. While 'neath its shelter lived the sons of men, And every creature by its produce fed. Anon, the scene was changed; a storm arose, Red lightnings gamboll'd through the murky sky; The forest-king was stricken from on high, Its branches riven, scatter'd too, its leaves Nor aught remain'd, save wither'd boughs. A horrid wreck, ill-fated monument Of fallen pride, with nothing to attest Its former glory, and world-wide renown, Except its trunk and earth-protected root; The whole, save that, was levell'd to the ground. Nitoc. Merciful Heav'n! how ominous these words! King. Indeed, the tree fell, crashing to the ground, As though it had been vengeance-struck from Heav'n. Pahir. (after a pause). King, Queen, priests, courtiers, all attend and live, For Heav'n inspires me to announce its will. Egypt may mourn; her day of trouble's come! The oppressor's fallen, his day too hath come, A day of retribution for his crimes! The idol from his pedestal is hurl'd; The tyrant has become his people's scorn,â And he, who aim'd to emulate the Gods, As well as awe mankind,âwho, not content With kingly honours, coveted divine,â Has sunk, heav'n-stricken, to the lowest depth. Ye widow'd nations,ânow are ye avenged, Ye kings, upon whose necks his feet have trod,â Behold the giant smitten by Heaven's wrath. Osmand. Wilt thou permit such insolence, O King? King. When I am silent, who shall dare to speak? Pahir. This wondrous tree, O King,âso large and strong, Foreshadows thee, and thy fast-coming doom:â Thy greatness and thy pride will have a fall, E'en like the forest-king's in thy dream; And all the nations, who beneath thy shade Reposed, will in thy fall be crush'd as well. Yea, woe to all who own thy despot sway. Think not, however, tyrant, thou shalt die! No;âthou shalt live,âthough fallen, weak, and sad;â Bereft, too, of that nobler faculty, That bright intelligence and moral sense, Which stamps man as the image of his God; And dragging slowlyâbound about your neckâ The heavy chain of your iniquities: A terrible example to the world! King. Is this the doom that you announce for me? Pahir. Such, mighty prince, is Heaven's decree:âbut mark: Time hastens; yet you may redeem yourself. Unloose the fetters of the captive kings; Destroy the monster Apis' bloody shrine,â And bow yourself before the God of Heav'n! King (calling to attendants). What, oh! Away now to my treasury, And fetch the sacred vessels all of gold, The jewell'd cups, and massive goblets rare, Which glitter'd in the temple of those Jews Ere I despoil'd it:âbring them here, I say, Let us from their worshipped goblets quaff The mellow, gen'rous wines of Greece to-night:â Thus shall we see, if all the threats you've made Are based on truth, or merely empty boast. Nitoc. 'Tis madness, King, to scorn these presages! Pahir. I call you all to witness,âprinces, priests, Nay, all,âlook on yon miserable King! His eye already glares with insane fires:â Already is he smitten by the breath of Heaven. King. Thou, slave,âwhate'er occurs,âshalt not enjoy My sufferings;âfor death this very hour Shall be thy doom:âseize on the traitor, guards. (To Osmand.) You, brother, see my orders are obey'd. Nitoc. Nay, Sire,âlet me entreat youâ King. Leave me, Queen! [Exit, looking with fury on the Queen, who follows him out, pleading. Pahiroth is led out; and just as Osmandyas is about to go out after him, Rachel stops him. Rach. A word,âfor pity's sake, a single word! Osmand. Fair Rachel, is it thou? To what event May I ascribe a pleasure so unwont, So unexpected? For, methought, your heart, Set free from its engagement, now abhorr'd My person and my love alike,ânay, cursed The fate that ever bound us:âprithee, speak! Rach. For pity's sake, Osmandyas, be still; Forget the past, and all its dreams of love: Thy scorn I cannot brook:âI'd sooner die. But tell me of this seer. Osmand. What askest thou Of him? Rach. His pardon!âhave it, too, I must. Osmand. His pardon! Heard you not the King's command. Remember,âsuch as he must be obey'd; Or else my life may pay the penalty. Rach. But if it be a crime that he commands? Osmand. The monarchânot his victimâI regard. Rich. It were betraying kings to serve them thus! Oh, be persuaded;âlisten to my pray'r: Behold my tears:âyou can do all at will. First, let the seer escape;âthen tell the King, Your brother, that the sentence of his wrath Was duly executed:âgo, prince, go, And earn a blessing from this troubled heart. Osmand. Compliance with your prayer were my death: Were it to be discover'd, I'm undone. Rach. Heav'ns! is it thus he treats my anguish'd soul! Have I so little pow'r then o'er his heart? Is't thus that when I urge him, all in tears, To save the hope of captive Israel, And hinder, too, a cruel butchery, The iron-hearted wretch refuses me, Alleging for excuse his selfish fear Of losing credit with yon tyrant king? Osmand. (aside.) Sorrow will make her soon my easy prey; For I've revived a passion in her heart, And now must hasten to complete my work. (Aloud.) I then of us am most to blame, it seems:â 'Tis I, who left you and renounced your love, I, who deserve the name of perjurer And traitor! (Changes his mood.) I, unmoved by your distress! Oh no;âthe sight of it appals my heart. Yes, Rachel, I cannot refuse your pray'r: Pahiroth shall be saved, whate'er the risk. My place at court, my life I'll sacrifice To do your bidding:âyet I must request A favour for the service you demand. Rach. A favour!âWhat? Osmand. To-morrow I depart, Spite of myself call'd hence by some caprice Of royalty:âyour gratitude, I trust, Will not deny a bliss I've long desired. Pahiroth's life is yours, if you'll consent To ask me in the gardens for 't to-night. Rach. I hear:âmy honour, then, must be the price At which alone you'll save the victim's life! But should I e'en consent to these vile terms, The palace is so strictly guarded, prince, That to escape were quite impossible. Osmand. This obstacle I have provided for. I know you maids of honour may not quit The palace-precincts;âno one, save the Queen, Has liberty to leave at any hour. But, listen to the scheme I now propose:â In order to deceive the sentinels Anon, I'll send you, Rachel, a disguise Precisely like th' apparel of our Queen,â A gown like hersâa mantle, too, and train; Nay, e'en a sparkling regal diadem, Graceful adornment,âwhich of right were yours, If beauty was sole warrant for a crown. Rach. But, then, my honour. Osmand. Psha! enough of this! Your coldness and your hate I've borne too long. My mind's resolved:âour ties shall be renew'd. Crown my desires,âand I'll do aught you wish. A trusty slave will bring you the disguise, Attired in which, you'll easily pass out Beyond the gardens. There will I await Your coming, eager for a fond embrace. What say you?âwill you come? Rach. Oh, cruel one, Will not these tears prevail? Osmand. Wilt come, I say? Consent, and he is sav'd;âif not, he dies: And mind,âa sign from me will seal his doom. [Is going to side, as if sign the executioners to strike. Rach. Stayâstay:âI willâI'll do what you require:â But you must by your god Osiris swear, That if I come, Pahiroth's life is safe. Osmand. (lifting up his hands). I swear itâby Osiris! It is well:â Our oaths are pledged to it:âso now, adieu! Rach. (aside). Fool! thinks he I'll endure his vile embrace? No; I'll defeat his wicked purpose still;â For 'neath my dress a dagger I'll conceal. [Exit. Osmand. (alone). Weak girl, what care I for thy love or hate? Thou'rt on a road, the end of which is death. Enter Hophrah. Osmand. (hastily). What of the King? Hoph. I'm by his order here. Nitocris first he banished; then, with flashing eyes And rapt in thought, he paced the vestibule; Next call'd to me:ââGo, Hophrahâquick, and tell âMy brother to reprieve yon slave, whose threats âAs little move me as his insolence:â And then he hurried out to join his court, Who hold high banquet, as his guests to-night, Quaffing in goblets plunder'd from the Jews Rich wine in scorn of Him they all adore. Osmand. 'Tis well:âour sov'reign's will shall be obey'd:â But, for your life,âbruit not abroad this act Of mercy; for this slave deserv'd his doom, And still shall see the sword hang o'er his head. Meanwhile,âgo, bring to me the serf's disguise, That I may come or go unrecognized. Beware, proud King;âfor high as is thy state, Ruin awaits thee, and a mournful fate! Scene.âThe Gardens of Rameses' Palace, with a View of the Nile, and Pyramids beyond. Night; moonlight. Enter Rachel hastily, disguised as the Queen. Rach. Where am I? Whither leads this lonely path? I'm lost in this dark, gloomy labyrinth. What matter, though? The veil of night will hide My sorrows from the world! Would it might last! All hope has fled:âmy crime, my shame, is known; And I'm for ever lost. Upon his knees The traitor was consoling me with honey'd speech, Swearing by Heav'n he would respect my tears,â When suddenly I saw the torch's flash, And voices echo'd on the terraces; Next I heard steps:âthe Queen,âthe King himself Appear'd; and I should still have been unseen, But for the tell-tale moon. I hear them still, Methinksâbut, no; (listens) all's hush'd in silence now (pause). My heart is bursting! Off, cursed diadem; Off, purple vesturesâfitted for a queen; I loathe you all:âavaunt, all empty pomp! [Throws off crown and mantle. Enter Osmandyas, at back. Osmand. My Rachel! Rach. Heavens!âOh, let us fly,âcome,âcome! Osmand. Fear notâ'tis I, my love; all danger's pass'd. Rach. Where has the King gone? Osmand. First, he follow'd me All through the gardens; but my rapid pace Baffled pursuit;âthen down a secret path I darted, and escaped unrecognized. Rach. What fate remains for meâunhappy me? Osmand. Cheer up, sweet girl!â'twas me alone he saw; I swear it, love;âso now, away back home, And hide from ev'ry eye that sadden'd face. Rach. I'll try:âyes, I am going. (Totters.) Ah!âtoo true:â I cannot. Osmand. We must separate:âadieu! [Exit. A pause. Rach. (calling). Stay! Is Pahiroth safe? He hears me notâ He's goneâhe flies from me: hard-hearted man! And though, alas! I granted all he ask'd,â He leaves me thus, a prey to mortal doubt. But who comes here? [Enter Pahiroth, led in by Hophrah, who retires to back. (Falling on her knees.) Pahiroth!âHeav'n-taught seer! Pahir. Call me thy brother, maid;âfor such I am. Rach. Art free,ârepriev'd from death? Pahir. Yes,âthanks to thee, And thy kind efforts:ânay, deny it not; For Hophrah told me, as he oped for me My prison door, and bade me follow him. Yes, I was mourning that my sudden flight Had balk'd me of a moment's interview To express in words my heart's deep gratitude. Rach. Away! at once, away! Pahir. So soon? Rach. At once! Each moment you're in danger, while you're here. I tremble for your life;âaway! Pahir. Be calm, Dear sister! Rach. (to Hoph.) Hophrah,âsee that no one comes. (To Pahir.) Know you the fate reserv'd for you?â'tis this:â Beyond these gardens, mid a group of planes And cypresses which peer above the rocks A gloomy cavern lies, carved out by art, And tenanted by those ill-fated men, Whom royal anger dooms to cruel death By torture:âin this horrible retreat Are lions, tigers, prison'd here t' afford The King, their master, cruel as themselves, The savage joy of seeing them devour Limb after limb the victims of his wrath. Such tortures will be thine; so, fly at once: Fly while you may, and to the desert go; Nor venture back, till Rachel bids you come. Pahir. The innocent, whose hearts are free from guile, Walk fearless through all peril, unalarm'd By sword, or fire, wild beast, or tyrant's ire. The King of Heav'n, good sister, 's at my side, And cheers me on amid the deepest woe: The Monarch should rather tremble; his fall, Is certain; and ere many hours have pass'd, These walls will see him prostrate on the ground. The news you give, though, much surprises me; 'Tis not the King then who has pardon'd me? Rach. No; you have wounded him too cruelly: If he should see you here, your death is seal'd. Pahir. Is't to Nitocris, then, I owe my life? Rach. Alas! the Queen has lost all influence; Though what she had, she used in your behalf: Your saviour is the brother of the King. Yes, he was kind: my tears prevail'd with him; And, Heav'n be prais'd you're free; what matter how? Ask nothing more, but go without delay. Pahir. Well, well, one parting word, and I'll away. Yes, child, and thou shouldst listen; for 'tis not Thy brother who is speaking, but thy sire. Rach. My sire, my father! Dost thou know him, then? Pahir. Ere I left Judah, in a lonely hut Retired from busy life, in solitude I met the venerable man, who wept At meeting me, whereon I questioned him About his sorrows, bidding him submit To Heaven's decree which visited our land And made it subject to a foreign king: Whereto the old man tranquilly replied;â âHeaven's Sovereign chastises whom he will; âAnd do whate'er he may, 'tis ever right. âThe source of my affliction isâmy child, âMy only daughter, who has fled from me âAnd now ne'er visits the paternal roof, âOr seeks the blessing of her aged sire: âAlas! if I should never see her more, â'Twill be, because her conscience fears my gaze, âAnd dreads that I may find her secret out.â Such was the message, which I pledged myself To whisper in your ear; and recollect, Though courtly honours may detain you here, Nature will still be heard. A father's voice Invites you, Rachel; and you must obey. A word from you could calm the tyrant's ire; Your influence is greatâemploy it then To get permission to revisit home, And soothe your father's pains; now promise me you will? Rach. I cannot: yet, be well assured I mourn my absence more e'en than himself: But thenâ Pahir. Come now, unfold to me your griefs. Rach. Oh! would to Heaven! Pahir. Come, tell me! Rach. (hiding her face in her hands). I cannot! Pahir. What urgent need, what hard necessity Can thus arrest th' emotions of your heart? Your father is aloneâin troubleâaged. Rach. But then he said, I could not bear his gaze! Oh, Heav'ns! should he but find my secret out; That fatal secret, fraught with misery! Pahir. What drear presentiment of woe is this? Is it of death you speak? Hoph. (coming forward hastily). You must away, Pahiroth; for I hear approaching steps, And see the torches flash. Rach. (after looking out anxiously). The King, the King! Fly, prophet, fly, before it is too late. Pahir. What! ere I've learnt the secret of your grief? Rach. Why wish you so to know this mystery? Pahir. Promise at least you'll go and see your sire; On that condition only will I fly. Hoph. They're coming! fly! (Pahir. still lingers.) Rach. (intensely anxious). I'll promise all; but go! Pahir. (joyfully). I will, I will. Heav'n bless thee, child; farewell! [Exit, followed by Hophrah. Rach. (in great agitation). Oh, I shall die! [Exit. Enter King hastily. King (calling furiously). Nitocris! yes, 'twas she: Hell's torments! her accomplice too I saw Fly, panic-stricken, through the murky gloom. I followed to chastise the insolent, And had my arm upraised to fell the wretch, When suddenly he darted down a path And by some demon's aid escaped my grasp, Nor could I recognize the caitiff's face; Though by the ruddy torchlight I could see He wore the vesture of my palace-slaves. A slave betray me, oh, 'tis horrible; That I, a mighty king, almost a God, Should be dishonour'd by a base-born slave. But who comes here? Re-enter Hophrah. Hoph. Your Majesty's commands Have been obey'd: your brother and the Queen Will presently be here. King (after a pause, calmly). I need, my friend, Some proof of your devotion; tell me all: You knew the Queen was guilty; and 'tis you Whom I must thank for having given me Ocular proof of her disloyalty. Hoph. (surprised). I know her secrets, Sire! I dare to peer Beneath the veil of royal privacy! I've better learnt the duties of my post. Whate'er you know, it is to chance, not me, You owe it, Sire. You sleepless lay in bed; And I suggested, that a silent walk And the beauty of the starlit scene Might somewhat calm your agitated frame; This, Sire, is all I knowâwhat would you more? King (agitated, mad). Darker and darker is this horrid night; The torchlight even casts a lurid glare: Before my burning eyelids, too, there floats A blood-red cloud, and on it writ, I seeâ âWoe to thee, scoffer; for Pahiroth's God âIs God alone of Heav'n and earth;â oh, oh! Avaunt, thou vision: why comest thou To madden me the more? (Pause.) Ah, see! she comes: Her bearing, too, betokens confidence. Enter Nitocris, followed by two Guards. Nitoc. What means this violence, this clamour, Sire? Am I awake, or has some demon-pow'r Peopled my sleep with foul and hateful dreams? Why is it, Sire, that Iâyour wifeâthe Queenâ The daughter, too, of kings, should thus be dragged, And by your ordersâlike some caitiff slave Or base-born rogue? Explain this mystery, And say, proud monarch, why you've outraged thus My queenly dignity? King (bitterly sarcastic). Which sits so well, Forsooth, upon so virtuous a dame. His name? I pray. Nitoc. What means your Majesty? King (furiously). No subterfuges! Come;âyour answer?âquick! Your guilt is proved; and soon shall vengeance dire Be hurl'd, vile harlot, on your trait'rous head. Nitoc. My guilt!âin what?âof what am I accused? King. Audacious, artful wretch! the name, I say, Of thine accomplice (with a burst), ay, thy paramour. You understand me, madam, now,âhis name? Nitoc. While you speak this in frenzied paroxysms, I comprehend you notânor are you, Sire, In a fit state to listen to my words. Good angels, guard the King from ev'ry harm! (is going out). King (stopping her). Once more, I ask; what is the traitor's name? Ah! silent! shall I slay thee in my wrath? Nitoc. Once more; what is it, Sire, that you would ask? King. Quickâspeakâor else, this swordâBut no:â I'll moderate my ire. Some base-born slave Was just now kneeling yonder at thy feet, Within yon trellis'd walk;âI follow'd him; But in the darkness he contrived t' escape. Nitoc. And you believed the odious calumny? What witnesses have you? Who charges me With crime? King. I am the witnesses; and these eyes Are thy accusers! Now, for thy defence! Nitoc. What answer can I make to such a charge? King. Ah, she confesses that she's guilty, then? Nitoc. On my soul, I've strictly search'd my heart, And scann'd the past memorials of my life, To find, if possible, some fitting cause For such insane excitement; but in vain. When yesterday I left your presence, Sire, Heart-stricken by the presages of woe The seer foretold you, I retired forthwith, To find some comfort, to my dear child's room, And in his smiles endeavour'd to forget My heavy trouble. Since the ev'ning star Has risen until now, I've tranquilly Kept watch beside his bed. (Going to the King.) Who is this slaveâ This shameless villain who has slander'd me? King. These eyes, I say, were witness to the fact; And by their evidence art thou condemn'd. What use then is it to address me thus? Dost think the touching music of thy voice, As formerly, will melt me to forgive? I've long suspected thee,âlong watch'd thy stepsâ Thy looksâthy very heart; and have unveil'd Its perfidy: which now my eyes confirm. Hadst thou reveal'd to me thy paramour, I might have pardon'd thee;âbut as thy choice Has been to brave my vengeance, thou shalt die. Nitoc. My sentence has beforehand been pronounced, I see: but subterfuges and deceit But ill become the monarch of the Nile. Speak honestly your mind. You would be free; You're weary of the chains of wedded life; Nay, more:âI've heard your heart is thirsting for Some new attachment; and moreo'er 'tis said, Ere long another queen may occupy My place upon your throne. Well; be it so, And kill me, if you will; but sully not That honour which was never until now E'en doubted,âlest my infant child some day Should scorn the mother who watch'd o'er his bed. King. What's this I hear? dost thou recriminate Instead of begging mercy, and pretend To cast a doubt on my fidelity? 'Fore Heav'n, Nitocris, I do love thee still, As I have loved thee everâconstantly; And no one e'er has won my heart from thee, Much less aspired to fill thy place at court. Thy crime will prove my death, as well as thine. Farewell! I wish'd for thee undying fame, And boundless power; but thy guilt has changed My mildness into fury: now I hate The entire race, and mean to be henceforth No longer the protector of my realm But an oppressor; yes, its scourge and curse, To all alikeâruthless, inflexible, And furious. Yea, let the flames of strife Be lighted up, and blood in torrents flow, Since 'tis thy will, O Queen, it should be so. [Exit. Nitoc. (alone). He's gone: and terror ties me to this spot. What was 't he charged me with? A man, he said, Was seen upon his knees before meâpsha! He must be mad: some demon must have lash'd Rameses into this unhappy rage, And put into his mouth that bitter taunt, That filthy, base, and dastard calumny He hurl'd at me. And yet he said, withal, He loved me,ânever other loved but me; Nay, loves me stillâas ever, constantly. Faugh! if he loved me still, as he pretends, He would not thus have heap'd on me foul wrong, And harshly menaced me with a divorce: Too well I know the secrets of his heart. And yet, he scarcely would pretend a love He does not feel: his heart's too proud for that. No: I'll confront him,âsee him face to face, And ask his reasons: yes, he SHALL explain! [Is going out, but her exit is opposed by Guards at sides. Ah, soldiers. Am I, then, a prisoner? It was my death, then, that his voice announced, And when he left, he breathed his last farewell! Enter Osmandyas, followed by a Slave bearing a dagger and a poison-cup. Nitoc. Your presence wakes me from a hideous dream And calls me back to life. Conduct me, pray, Into the monarch's presence. Heav'ns, you weep! Osmand. The King to his apartments has retired, Nor may he be approach'd on pain of death. Nitoc. Let death strike ME then;âsee the King I must. Osmand. Unhappy lady, you may not go hence. My brother has decided on your doom; Nor could our tears or prayers bend his will. Death is your sentence; and a mute is here, Bearing a dagger and a poison'd bowl. But tell me, lady, injured as you are, Will you yield up your honour and your life To glut this butcher's gory appetite? If so, with grief I leave you to your fate And pity you; but if your heart rebels Against this monstrous parricidal act, And you resolve to brave his blood-red arm, And vindicate your natural just rights, As queen and mother both, I'll join your cause: Nay, set you free, and help you to revenge. Nitoc. My senses surely have deceived me, prince! I understand you not. The King, you say, Has will'd that I should die; but why? I ask: What crime have I committed? Come, explain. Osmand. A rival seeks your place upon the throne. Nitoc. (much agitated). Oh, Heav'ns!âmy son, my son! [Weeps. Osmand. O'ercome your fears And dry your tears: you may escape 'em now. The people groan impatient 'neath the yoke Of tyranny; and at a sign from you Unnumber'd hosts will rise in your behalf, And dash his misused sceptre to the ground. I'm warden here, and give you leave to go. First, summon to your aid the troops Who, in Rameses' absence, form'd your guard, And tell them of the danger threat'ning you. Their swords forthwith will from their scabbards leap, And all will fly t' avenge their injured Queen. Nitoc. What! you, the sov'reign's brother, counsel this? Youâhis adviser and chief confidant? No, prince; act not a traitor's part for me! Osmand. Nay, lady, you mistake my meaning quite. I meant not to propose the tyrant's death. No; let him live, and share with you the throne; But let your powers be equal and alike; Yourself as independent as himself. Nitoc. Your friendship blinds you to your duty, prince. Wouldst have me plunge the realm in civil war? Against a husband, too! Great Heaven forfend! Osmand. Must then the hideous sentence be fulfill'd? Nitoc. It must. I'd sooner die than owe my life To an attempt of such o'erpow'ring guilt As treason 'gainst the honour of his crown. Farewell! and tell the King I pardon him For having slander'd thus my loyalty. Osmand. Have you no other message, Queen, to give? Nitoc. Yes, one, good brother. I've an infant son, The very thought of whom bids flow my tears; I dare not see himâ't would unnerve my soul, And quite unfit me for my coming pain. Prithee take charge of him; and should the King Resolve to sacrifice his interests To some unjust stepmother, recollect The charge I left you with my parting breath. Osmand. My life, my all, is his; but what can I Avail against a madden'd, angry king? Enter Rachel hastily, and out of breath. Rach. Ah, Madam! Nitoc. What? Rach. The prince, your sonâ Nit. Great Heav'n! what of him?âspeak. Rach. Some soldiers came At dead of night, and carried him away. Nitoc. My child? Rach. Alas, too true! Nitoc. Unhappy me! Come, tremble not; but speak. Rach. Our prayers, our tears, Avail'd not to dissuade them from the deed: They took him to the King. Nitoc. I breathe again;â His father! Rach. Say his murderer rather, Queen! He purposes to sacrifice his child At Apis' shrine. Some fiend has madden'd him. Nitoc. What! kill my child? and he the father, too! Away then, dagger and poison-bowl; For now I'll live. (To Osmand.) Art willing, brother, still To ope my prison door? Osmand. Queen, you are free: Go forth then fearlessly; for trusty friends, Assured by me, will win the populace, And arm them to revenge your giant wrongs. Nitoc. Osmandyas, my eyes are open'd now: Your caution proves to me some plot's afoot; And your averted glance betrays your guilt. What matters it to me? the interests Of my beloved child are paramount. Come on then, let us brave his fury wild;â Unnatural tyrant, give me back my child!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. Scene.âA hall in the palace at Memphis; caryatides, or pillars in the shape of men, supporting the entrance at back; other similar pillars, in Egyptian style, on either side. Stage darkened. Enter Rachel hurriedly, with Hophra. Rach. And must I fly thus hurriedly? Hoph. At once! The danger you are in brooks not delay. In sooth, you should rejoice to quit this roof; For, ruled by some fell, fatal influence, Its walls already totter to their fall. Nitocris is in arms against her lord; And fire and slaughter soon will soil these courts. To rescue you from these, Osmandyas Solicits you, through me, to fly at once. Rach. What, fly? and leave Nitocris' infant child, His mother absent 'mid the din of war! I cannotâdare not leave my sacred charge. Hoph. Your father, Rachel, is expecting you; Impatient counts each minute you delay, And longs to clasp you in his loving arms. Wilt let him wait in vain? Rach. What, has he heard Of my return? Hoph. He has; and should he not Before to-morrow's dawn embrace his child, Amid such tumult and such dire events He'll haply think you 've fallen in the fray. Rach. Enough; I'll go then: to delay were ill. (Aside.) My torments I must bear, however great, And from his anxious gaze conceal my shame; Yea, stoop to falsehood; for, were he to know My fatal secret, he would break his heart. I'll fly to himâHeaven grant no more to part. [Exit. Enter Osmandyas stealthily, from back. Osmand. She's gone! Hoph. She is, prince; nor did she upbraid. Osmand. 'Tis well; for her then we have nought to fear. What says, what does the King? Hoph. He's still abed, Watching for sunrise. Thinking, too, the Queen Has suffered, enjoying his revenge. Osmand. Yon sentinels are bribed? Hoph. Ay, and removed. Osmand. Hast given notice to the trusty bands That camp outside the gates,âacross the Nile,â That they will haply be required to-night? Hoph. Yes; all are ready. Osmand. (exultingly). Why then, I've reached at last. The goal of my ambition, and can glut This ulcer'd heart with vengeance. Hark! what's that? Didst hear aught, Hophrah? Hoph. No, prince; not a sound. Osmand. 'Tis nearly dawn; yet nought has yet been done. Where is the Arab slave of whom you spake? Hoph. At hand; he waits your pleasure, prince, without. Osmand. And you are sure of his fidelity? Hoph. I'll stake my life on it. Osmand. Admit him then. [Hophra goes to side and enters with Elhakim. (To Slave.) 'Tis well: your prompt obedience pleases me. All has succeeded; and the time has come For finishing the work you undertook. Your victim's ready, and must not escape. Yes; see you (points to left); yonder must you strike the blow. Say, is your courage screw'd up to your work, Or do vague terrors agitate your heart? Elhakim. Here (bares his breast), feel it, prince: its pulse is calm as yours. Osmand. 'Tis well; yet recollect, you know the King But by report, or distantly beheld; You now will see him near; and see to this:â Let not his frowns, his words, or threat'ning glance Intimidate or turn you from the deed: Be like the eagleâgazing on the sun. Elhak. I will. Whate'er he be,âa conqueror Or slave,âI fear him not; he's but a man: Were he a lion even, he should die. Osmand. Here; take this dagger, and await my sign. Elhak. Gods of my native deserts, well ye know These hands till now have ne'er shed human blood; Nor is it greed of gold that drives me thus To do the bidding of this fratricide. No; higher motives guide meâdire revenge For children murder'd, and a wife borne off, By fiendlike ravishers before my eyes. Osmand. 'Tis well. His crimes are writ upon his face. Observe exactly my commands, and wait With ears attentiveâdagger, too, in handâ For the appointed signal; he's asleep, So all escape's impossibleâyou see. Once more, be on th' alert: and now adieu! (Aside.) We now shall see whether the seer spoke true! [Exit, Hophra following. Elhak. (alone). They're gone! Away, ye wicked ones, away! And treason crowd on treason, till the sun Blush crimson, horror-stricken by your deeds! I'll strike the death-blow when and how I please: But kill him sleeping! play the coward thus! I cannot, dare not. 'Tis my wish, besides, That he should perish, conscious of his sins, And penitent. No, I will wake the wretch; If he resistâwhy, all the better (starts). Ah! Enter King, left. King. The stars have paled; the moon, too, it hath set In blood;âall's quietâall asleep. I'll go. Elhak. What sound was that? Methought I heard a voice. Ah, who comes here? King (groping his way in the dark). All's silent: not an eye Is waking now to notice my escape. Quick, quick; this hated palace let me leave. Elhak. No crown upon his brow,âsuch mean attire! Can it be he? I cannot see his face. King. Now will I go (is going). Elhak. (stopping him). Hold, there! King. Oh, pity me, And let me hence. Elhak. This cannot be the King: He ne'er would plead for mercy. Who goes there? Speak instantly, or I will slay you: speak! King. Have pity, stranger! Who am I, you ask. A wretched slave, endeavouring to escape From thraldom. Oh, betray me not! Elhak. What! I betray you? fear not that, my friend; For I'm a slave myself, and feel for you. Begone, at once, from 'neath this cursed roof So foully stain'd with crime. The way is clear; And see you tarry not. I've bus'ness hereâ To wreak my vengeance. King. Is 't the King you seek? Elhak. Away now, while you may! King. What is 't you want With him? Elhak. That, friend, to-morrow will unfold. King. He whom you seek is now no longer there. Erewhile, afflicted by a hideous dream About a giant tree, whose sudden fall Predictedâso a saucy Jew allegedâ His coming madness, he became depress'd And sad. Anon, another vision came:â A woman in the gardens secretly Stealing along its walks, whom presently The moon reveal'd as his adult'rous wife. Then changed the scene; for next he saw the Queen Lie poison'd on her bed,âhis son, too, stretch'd Upon the fun'ral bier. These fearful dreams, Like demons haunting him, have rack'd his brain; Till lastly, hating e'en his regal state, And casting off his crown and purple robe, He has assumed the habit of a slave. You would have speech with him? behold himâhere! Elhak. What! you the King! King. That title I abjure. Betray'd by her I love; insulted too, And hated by my people, I would fly, And in the desert hide me from the world; There all my pride and glories past forget, And live an anchoret within a cave. Elhak. What! this the tyrantâthis the conquerorâ This the oppressor of our Arab tribes? Shades of my children and my sainted wife, Come, aid me now, and nerve this wav'ring arm! King. What! mourn you, like myself, a wifeâa child? Heav'ns, what is that? a dagger in your hand! Whose life would you destroy, unhappy man? Art bent on murdering some hated foe? Oh, shed not blood! Heaven's vengeance will pursue The murderer, and visit him with ills Severe as those I suffer now myself, Whom conscience haunts, presenting scenes of blood, And spectre-victims of my cruelty. But hold! I wish'd t' escape: yon gate is closed. Elhak. Weak thought! escape's impossible, O King! Bethink thee of thy danger. See this blade That glitters o'er your head; 'twas given me To murder you; so now prepare to die. And who, suppose you, bade me do this deed? Your brother! King. Ah, 'tis thou, Osmandyas, Dear brother! How could I mistake thy voice? My brain's bewilder'dâI've forgotten all. Elhak. Not so have I. Come, recollect yourself. I'm not your brother: look at me; I'm not; But this I amâthe arm of vengeance sent By outraged justice 'gainst a tyrant's life. You tremble! ah, you understand me now. King. What noise is that? Hark, it approaches us, Like billows breaking on the ocean-shore! Elhak. Fond fool! why trifle thus in thy last hour? It is the signal of th' insurgent troopsâ The signal I awaited for your death. King. Not so: they're wailing voices from the tomb For her so lately dead. Elhak. (with a burst). Nitocris lives To tear you from your sceptre and her child; The child you ravish'd from her mother's breasts. But why delay? Your time has come: I've sworn To slay you. King. Peace! yon gleaming weapon hide, And with abated breath your voice restrain. HushâhushâI say. Ah! they're approaching us. They come, they come; support me, or I faint. See how they crowd upon meâall my foesâ In serried ranks from every country round, From Nubia and the East to furthest Ind: And hark! I hear the widows', orphans' wail; See spectres grinning at me from their graves, Gaunt victims of my gory headsman's axe. Avaunt! I did it not; stare not on me With those unnat'ral, spectral, sightless orbs! Elhak. Unhappy King! his misery disarms My vengeance; he's the victim of Heaven's wrath, And Heaven shall deal with him as it may please. I will not interfere. Osmandyas Must find some other hand more firm than mine To do the deed:âmy hate's to pity turn'd. (To King.) Come, hapless madman, come, I'll save thy life. Away, thenâlet us leave this scene of strife. [Exeunt by side-door. Enter Osmandyas, Priest, and others at back. Osmand. Come, holy priests, and valiant warriors too, Come; let us die to save, or else avenge Our sov'reign. Enter Nitocris from side. 1st Priest. Wretched Queen! what hast thou done? What demon-spirit has aroused thee thus? What ferment of revolt and civil war, Fired up by thee, is raging through the land? A wife against her husband turnâa queen Against a king!âOh, fear'st thou not Heaven's wrath? Nitoc. The demon that aroused me yonder stands! [Pointing to Osmand. Osmandyas there urged me to the deed. Osmand. I urged you, Queen? 'Fore Heaven it is a lie! Your proofsâyour witnessesâwhere are they?âcome! Nitoc. For yonder traitor, I too much despise His baseness, e'en to contradict his tale. To you alone, good Priest, will I reply. Last night Rameses sentenced me to death In passion onlyâfor no other causeâ 'Tween knife and poison giving me the choice; And to my lips I had already raised The fatal cup when, suddenly, I heard My darling boy was likewise doom'd to die. The mother-spirit in me fired t' avenge My child; and to my body-guards I flew, Calling on them to arm in our defence. Thank Heav'n, my child is saved, and to their camp They have return'd by my express command. But for the boy, he's with them, in their charge. This now accomplish'd, it was my design To yield myself to custody again. Osmand. (sneeringly). A plausible excuse, indeedâbut false! Queen, if your soldiers have return'd to camp, It is because they saw we were prepared, And able to resist. If it be trueâ And they have done no moreâ'tis fortunate. Heaven grant you may be innocent and true! But I've my doubts until I've seen the King. Nitoc. I'm waiting his arrival like yourself. Osmand. Why comes he not? What obstacle unseen Detains his Majesty? Is he asleep? That may not be:âthe clash of swords upraisedâ The din of war within these regal walls Would have awaken'd him. Why comes he not? His chamber's yonder, princesâgo and look! I dare not; for this fatal night I fear. (Turning to Nitoc.) But why so pale, Queen? I accuse not you. Nitoc. (passionately). No, wretch, but I do you!âYou've murder'd him! Priest. Murder'd! Great Heaven forfend!âHere Hophrah comes; He haply may resolve these hideous doubts. Enter Hophrah. Osmand. Ah, Hophrah, tell usâwhere's the King? Hoph. Alas! The King, your brother, princeâ Osmand. Heavens! is he dead? (In an undertone) He has been slain as I suspected, then. Hoph. Noâhe still breathes. Osmand. (aside). Hell-furies! Nitoc. He is saved! Kind Heaven be praised! Priest. Comeâquickâexplain thyself. Why troubled thus?âwhy look so terror-stricken? What has befallen him? Hoph. The dreamâthe dream! Osmand. What! is he wounded? Hoph. No; but what's far worse, His reason has deserted him!âhe's mad. Osmand. What say you?âmad! Hoph. His dream, Pahiroth's threat, And the revolt, combined, have rack'd his brain, And reft him of his reason. Only now I met him, stagg'ring through the vestibule With wild and frenzied look, disorder'd dress, And brow uncrown'd. He recognized me not, But in his gestures, air, and strange discourse He show'd alike an intellect diseased. Nitoc. Unhappy me! I'll fly. (Is going.) Hoph. Nay, stayâhe comes! Enter King, supported by two Attendants. King. Where are you leading me?âwhom see I here? What means yon crowd?âwhy look they so at me? Priest. Our looks, O King, portray our love for you, And our respectâalas! our fear as well. King. Why mock me with the name of King, old man? Methought you would have pitied my sad fate. Priest. Thou art indeed a king, my son; and here, Upon my bended knee, I homage pay. (Kneels.) King. Dost wish my death, then? Priest. Why suspect it, Sire? King. No act of treason would surprise me now! Priest. Cheer up, O King!âthe rebels are disarm'd, Dispersed; your palace is at peace once more. Your fears are needless; the conspirators Had no design upon your sacred life. King. Nay; one of themâa Nubian slave, methoughtâ With gleaming poniard menaced me with death. Priest. Murd'rous attempt! What saved you from his fangs? King. A bolt from Heaven palsied the regicide arm; Conscience-struck, he gave me up the steel! [Shows the dagger. Priest. Too certain proof of crime! Who arm'd this slave? Nitoc. (pointing to Osmand., who is horror-struck). See! 'twas Osmandyas! Osmand. (starting, then sarcastically). Nay, ask the Queen! Priest. Heaven's justice aid me! (To King.) Yes, I understand. Struck by remorse, the murderer himself Rescued his victim. Did he tell you, Sire, Who bade him do the deed? King (bewildered). He tell meâhe? I cannot say;âI do not recollect: Nay, more, I'd gladly rid me of the thought. Priest. Pray, spoke he of your brother or the Queen? King. My brother!âhave I one? No, nor a son. I am aloneâaloneâin the wide world. (Weeps.) Nitoc. (going to him in tears). My Kingâmy husbandâbe thyself again! Look o'er the pastâreflectâere it's too late. Yon murdererâsaid he not who order'd him, And paid him for his sacrilegious act? Where is he now; or whither did he go On leaving you? Come! furnish us some clue Whereby to catch this monster!âpray, reflect! King (looking at Nitoc., bewildered). Who is this woman?âwhence is it? My heart Thus echoes back the music of her voice, And in her face my wilder'd eyes behold Some loved familiar image of the past. How is 't she frightens meâyet fascinates? Tell me, fair ladyâart of mortal mould, Sensible to touch as sight? These lines That channel thy fair visage, are they tears? Tell me your name! Nitoc. He asks my name;âalas! (Weeps.) Osmand. (whispering to King). Beware, O King! Some fiend possesses you. What! know you not the features of the Queen,â Her, whom you erewhile condemn'd to die? What! think you she does not deserve her doom, Or will you pardon herâbecause a queen? King. What is 't he says? Osmand. Your wrath is easily Appeased;âher lover, tooâwilt pardon him? 'Twas in the garden, recollect, last night, You watch'd the dalliance that was your shame. Nitoc. His face lights up; his eyes with fury gleam! King. What, thou, Nitocrisâthou, the harlot-queen! What witch'ry raised thee from that fatal tomb To which I sent thee?â'Twas thy cursed art Which kindled up the fire that scorches me: 'Twas thou that cover'd me with burning shame, And yet thou blushest not to look on me. But tremble, wretch! I still am king, and now Will prove it. [Proceeds tottering towards the throne. Osmand. going to help him, he repulses him. Leave meâI shall go alone! (To Priest.) Thou shalt decide, High Priest:âthis wife of mine Has been a rebelâan adultress, too! Hophrah, like me, was witness to her crime, And can point out both place and time, her look and mien. Comeâjustice, friends! All (pointing to Nitocris). Yeaâjustice on the Queen! [Curtain falls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. An interval of Six Months. Scene I. âA portico of the Palace, with gardens at the back; Pyramids in distance. Rachel discovered kneeling at Pahiroth's feet. Pahir. Rise, Rachel, rise; kneel not to me; Heav'n is thy judge, not I. I pity thee, And would assist in solacing thy woes. But, first of all, Nitocris must be saved, The tale of whose misfortune reach'd e'en me Beyond the desert. By what miracle Does she still live, although six months and more Have now elapsed, since she was doom'd to die? Rach. The priests arraign'd her for a double crime: First, treason 'gainst the monarch's sacred life By th' agency of some base Arab slave, But whom with all our search we've fail'd to find. Next, casting shame upon her marriage-bed, But whom she chose to be her paramour We know not; nor, until our frenzied King Regains his reason can the truth be known. Hence the delay.âThe Queen's in prison still. Pahir. Ah, sad reverse of fate! Unhappy Queen! Tell meâhave all her friends deserted her? Rach. They have. The rumour of her crimes has steel'd All hearts against her; e'en her oldest friends Who follow'd in her train from Syriaâ Her childhood's homeâhave left her to her fate. Pahir. And you, the while, kept hid within your breast The truth of all, when e'en a word from you Would have released her from captivity! Rach. Oh, spare me! I am guilty, I confess; But what I did was done unconsciously. I heard vague rumours of a trait'rous plotâ A midnight interviewâbut knew no more. And why? Osmandyas had sent me off; Nay, more; he threaten'd, if I should reveal The little that I knew, to slay my sire. That menace seal'd my lips. But Heav'n, alas! Has ta'en him from me, so I now may speak. Pahir. What meanest thou? Rach. (in an agony of sobs). My father died last night; I closed his eyes; and with his parting breath He bless'd his child. Pahir. Poor girl! Rach. Why pity me? My griefs are over; I am happy now. Pahir. Thou happy! Rach. Ay, Pahiroth, death is bliss! Now I behold it near, and welcome it! Pahir. Nay, thou shalt live! Rach. Impossible! the laws Of Egypt, and our country too, inflict On crimes like mine the chastisement of death. Except by poison, I cannot escape The headsman's axe. Pahir. What! slay thyself, mad girl, And quench the sacred fire sent down from high! Rach. Oh! pardon me, great seerâmy brain's distraught. But time wears on; these gloomy images Dispel; and aid me to set free the Queen. Pahir. 'Tis well; by saving her, thee, too, I'll save. Rach. And so before the world my shame expose! Pahir. That shall not beâbut can I see the King? Rach. What would it profit if you did? Dost think He'd listen to your words, or comprehend Their meaning? No; his body, like his mind, Is feeble as a child's; the least surprise Might be his death. What is it you propose? Enter Benassar, a Jewish attendant on the Queen. Ben. Fly, prophet, fly at once; Osmandyas Has just return'd. (Rachel terrified.) Pahir. (To Rachel.) Fear not, my child! (To Benassar.) Dost know The cause of his return? Ben. The priests to-day Have sentence pass'd upon our hapless Queen. He brings with him the warrant for her death. Rach. Her death!âgreat Heaven! Pahir. Hush! we shall save her yetâ 'Tis not too late. Ben. (eagerly). See, see! here comes the Kingâ His brother, too, who guides his tott'ring steps. You must retire. Pahir. Benassar, of thy zeal I'll ask for some new proof. Ben. Command me, then, O learned seer, and thou shalt be obey'd. Pahir. 'Tis well; conduct us hence, and thou shalt know, Good friend, what service 'tis I claim of you. [Exeunt. Enter King, supported by Osmandyas and followed by Hophrah. Osmand. (to Hoph.) Hophrah! my mind's resolved; this very day The King shall name me to the realm his heir, Excluding thus Nitocris from that throne and crown She covets. Curses on her head! die she shall! King. Shepherd,âexclaim'd the stranger,âtell me this:â What height is yonder, cover'd with the wreck Of all-destructive Time? No plant or herb Is seen to grow upon its arid sand, While o'er its surface hideous vipers crawl; Ill-omen'd spot! To whom the hind replied:â Stranger, a monarch yonder buried lies. Osmand. Come, Sire; let not your soul yield up itself To carking cares and melancholy thoughts. Once more be king, and let Nitocris meet The sentence she so richly has deserved: At dawn to-morrow, you will be revenged Upon the traitress. Hoph. (aside to Osmand.) His mind, methinks, today Is less distraught. Osmand. Yes, I shall now succeed. King (to himself). To-morrow she's to die? So young, so fair; 'Tis pity. Yet we all are doom'd alike, All travelling towards one point; For life is but a respite brief from death. Nay, further; she may die before me yet. Osmand. Nay, live, Sire, for your people's happiness: The glory of your arms will keep a pow'r Which in an infant's hands would fall to nought. King. A child! what meanest thou? Osmand. Nitocris' child, Who's destined to succeed you on the throne, That is, unless you exercise the right You have of barring his inheritance. King. I've said already, he shall ne'er be king. Osmand. Take from him then all chance; and that Will you effect by signing this (opens a roll), a will Or edict, which declares, who on your death Shall wield the sceptre, wear the diadem; You understand! King. But whom am I to choose? Osmand. That were not hard: Rameses' lineage Dies not with you; have you forgotten one, A faithful friend; methinks he served you well? King. A friend! whom mean you? speak! Osmand. Your brother, Sire. Against that choice what have you to allege? King (pushing aside the parchment impatiently). Why weary me on such a topic? go! Osmand. By your past glories, I conjure you, King, To save your empire from dismemberment, By naming, as your heir, one of your blood. King. What is 't thou askest, to appoint thee heir To Egypt's crown? No; on the worthiest Let it descend. Osmand. Is that your brother? King. No! Osmand. Why treat me thus with scorn? King. Seek not to delve Into my heart; enough is it for you, That I would sooner any one were king Than he. Osmand. You hate him then? King. The crown I wear Would lose its lustre, being worn by him. Osmand. Is he not, like yourself, of regal birth? King. Just so; but he dishonours it. Osmand. In what? King (with energy). To form new empires, what avails high birth? 'Tis courage, heroism, that wins the prize; And he who aims at this ambitious task, My troops have seen him, like a coward, fly! Osmand. (passionately). Madman and fool, too soon will you find out That I'm your master; (with threatening glance) sign this edict;âquick! King (cowed, goes to table and signs it). Nay, threaten not;âI've sign'd it: there it is! [Gives it. Osmand. Here, Hophrah; take it, and through Memphis' streets Proclaim the right it gives me to the crown. Nitocris dead, there's no one 'tween the throne And me, except a madman near his grave. (To King, going close to him.) To conquer's nothing; the true road to pow'r Is by dissembling: you despised me, dolt, Too much to fear me; 'tis that very pride, Has proved your ruin. Like the forest-king, You deem'd yourself invincible; yet I Have, like a serpent, winding round its folds, Destroy'd your power, even as he kill'd. Come, Hophrah, follow me; our task's fulfill'd. [Exit, followed by Hophrah. The King sinks down exhausted. Stage darkened: then enter Pahiroth slowly, led in by Benassar, who goes out, leaving a lamp on table. Pahir. (going up to the King). Come; be yourself again; lean on this arm, Prince, formerly so mighty, now so weak; Look at me fearlessly, and listen too; For I have that to say that will allay Your grief, and balm distil into your heart. King. Music greets me in that prophetic voice. Those eyes of gentleness illuminate The darkness of my path? Pahir. I am, O King, A messenger of mercy sent to you, And bear aloft the olive-branch of peace. King. Mercy and peace! Those words have disappear'd From human language. What has led you here? Pahir. I'm come to comfort you. King. Indeed! and why? What interest, I ask, feel you in me? Art wretched, like myself? Pahir. Accept my aid, And I will save you. Have faith in him! King (trying to remember). Where have I seen you? I've some vague idea. Whence come you? What's your country? Pahir. Palestine. King. Ah, Palestine! a name that, 'spite myself, Fills me with dread; because its people fear A God whose laws, whose anger I've defied: Canst tell me how he punishes, this God? Pahir. How he forgives, I can. King. Then intercede For me, young man; for I am sure your pray'r Will find an answer: yet you merited A better fate; what led you here so far? Pahir. A father's cruelty. King. Had Heav'n vouchsafed To me a son like you, so fair, so good, I should have loved him, nay, been proud of him. Pahir. His own hand sign'd the edict for my death; And so I fled. King. A father slay his son! The monster! Pahir. I have not yet told you allâ My mother he suspected of a hideous crime. King. Great Heav'n! his sorrows have been heavy then. But tell me, was he certain of her guilt? What proof had he? Pahir. He thought he saw at night Within a garden, 'neath a linden-tree My mother seated; at her feet a slave. King. Ah, in a garden? Well, did he avenge His injured honour, and dispatch the slave? Pahir. No, Sire; he fled, protected by the night. King. The partner of his crime was punish'd, though? Pahir. She will anon; her sentence is pronounced. King. What is it? Pahir. Death. King. A very just one too. Pahir. Nay, 'tis not; for my mother's innocent. King. Doubtless it is your duty as a son To try to prove it. Pahir. And 'tis yours, as king, To save her. King. What! when she's declared by law To have defiled her bed; your father, too, Eye-witness of her crime? Pahir. Unknown to him, His eyes deceived him: he beheld her not. King. How know you that? what proof have you to give? Pahir. Another woman had assumed her guise, Whom in the distance, 'mid the gloom of night, And madly jealous, he mistook for her. This lie, a traitor's villany confirm'd. King (aside). What storm is this uprising in my soul Thus unexpectedly; or is 't a dream? (To Pahiroth.) What tale is this you tell me of your sire? Strange simile! It is my history You've been recounting to me 'neath his name! That any other could have suffer'd thus, Exceeds belief. Oh, tell meâdo, young man, Of whom was it you spake? Pahir. Your heart can guess. King. How can it, cruel one, when reason's light Is flick'ring in its socket, half extinctâ When gloomy visions float across my brain Each instant, tangling hopelessly the thread Of my ideas? My brain's bewilder'd, mazed! [Reflects. I know not if I comprehend aright Your purpose;âbut you possibly have come To plead for pardon in the Queen's behalf. If so,âblest be you, stranger, trebly blest, For speaking of her! Oh, how I have long'd To drink in comfort from her loving eyes, But dared not ask to see the wretched one. [Beckons to Pahiroth to approach. (Whispering.) I'll whisper now a secret in your ear:â In spite of all her crimes, I love her still. See her I will, too,âmust, before she dies,â To sob a last farewell. (Calling.) What!âsoldiers, ho! Lead in your Queen. Pahir. (going to back and pointing). Behold, she yonder stands! [The stage, which was before quite dark, covered by a black curtain (which rises), is lighted up by the moon; and Rachel is seen, seated in the garden, under a linden-tree, clad in purple, and wearing a crown like the Queen's. King (after gazing, terrified, for some seconds). Heav'ns!âit is she;âmy wife! Pahir. Lookâlook again! Yonder's the linden-tree, 'neath which she sat. She sits there still,âas when with frenzied gaze You look'd on her,âdeceived, as you are now. King (violently). Deceived, as I am now. 'Tis false, I say. (Calling.) Osmandyas, slaves,âon the traitress seize; Seek, too, her paramour: his doom is seal'd! [Furiously. Pahir (calmly). Wait, Sire; be calm. King (furiously). Who dares detain me,âwho? Pahir. You will not punish, Sire, before you hear? I'll lead her to you. [Fetches Rachel, who is veiled. The King draws his sword. King. Where am I? The wretch! Ah! Let me strike at her. Pahir. Behold! [Rachel kneels before him unveiled. King. Great heav'ns! 'Tis not Nitocris! Pahir. No! She whom you see Trembling there at your feet, is not the Queen, But an unhappy girl, whose zeal for me In trouble plunged her. It was her you saw Busied in talk beneath the linden-tree: For, yielding to the counsels of a fiend, She thoughtlessly assumed the Queen's attire, Not knowing what the traitor's object was,â But simply purposing to save my life. That purple robeâthat veilâthat diademâ Caused the mistakeâso fatal to the Queen. Rach. Pahiroth, Sire, has spoken but the truth. Nor dare I ask for pity or forgiveness more. King. Speak,âspeak again!âthe accents of your voice, Echo in my ear, are drops of reason. Each word you utter, too, removes, methinks, A portion of the load that weigh'd me down. An unexpected calm succeeds the storm; A welcome light has burst upon my sight. [Looks eagerly at Rachel, as if remembering her suddenly. (Pause.) Ah, Rachel, it is you! I see,âI see: 'Twas madd'ning jealousy that blinded me. Nitocris was not false;âshe's innocent! Pahir. Well, then, preventâ King. Nay,âinterrupt me not. My joy's o'erflowing, and must have its course. Can it be true? Joy inexpressible! Shall I once more behold my wife,âmy child? Ah! what amends can I e'er make you both, Having hated those I should have loved? Support me;âhelp!âI totterâI shall fall. [Falls into an Officer's arms. (Pause.) All's o'er, Pahiroth! This too sudden burst Of happiness has been too strong a shock; The torch of life at last is dying out. Pahir. Cheer up! My arm is nigh to break your chain. Complete my work by setting free the Queen. Forget not, Sire,âa sentence has been pass'd. King. A sentence!âah, too true;âyon priests have doom'd The Queen to death;âbut will my brother then Permit this base injustice? Pahir. He permit! 'Twas he who urged them to their bloody work. His dark cabals, his dev'lish cunning, too, Caused all Nitocris' sorrows. Come, haste on And follow me, ere it's too late;âthis way! (Is going.) King. Yes,âlet us go! (Totters two or three paces, then stops and thinks.) My brother, too, heap up Such wrongs! (Goes slowly to back, then stops.) Ah,âsee you yon dark, threat'ning clouds? Pahir. Such dismal visions from your soul dispel! King (goes back, then stops, as if listening). Ah,âhear you not i' th' air those heav'nly strains? Pahir. Nought can I hear,âexcept Nitocris' sobs,â Whose bitter tears we're hast'ning now to dry. [Gradually retiring at back. Rach. For me, alas,ânought's left, except to die. [Falls despairingly on stage. Music. Scene II. âA Hall in the Pharaoh Palace; caryatides at back and sides; table, ottomans, etc. Curtain down at back. Osmandyas seated on an ottoman, Hophrah standing near him. Osmand. Thus far has fortune, Hophrah, crown'd our plans; But ne'er was vessel so near foundering As ours. That cursed Pahiroth unappalled By my severity sought out the King, And roused his slumb'ring senses to the truth. No matter!âhe is punish'd! My commands Have, doubtless, been obey'd. Hophr. They have, great prince; But, ere we seal'd his prison-door, he cried: âYe deem your sov'reign dead; but he still lives, âAnd will ere long accomplish mighty deeds; âYea, will awake to action in due time;ââ By some great miracle, methought, he meant. Osmand. (impatiently). Psha! He is dead:âthe priests pronounced him so: And who would doubt their wondrous learning, pray? His body,âmind you,â(with a meaning glance) which, at their request, I've handed o'er to them,â(tapping him on shoulder) they'll answer for. But tell me;âdid Pahiroth speak these words In other's presence, man, as well as yours? Who heard this prophecy? Hophr. Pahiroth's dead:â Besides the mutes, who seal'd his living grave, It was a custom of the ancient Egyptians to bury criminals in caves, which were afterwards walled up, and the captives left to starve to death. And me, no witnesses were present, Prince. Rachel, 'tis true, beheld us seize on him; But poison has already done its work, And still'd her voice eternally in death. Osmand. (with a malicious smile). 'Tis well:âone enemy more of mine is gone. Ah! what is that? (Listens.) Hark! hear you yonder buzz? It is the sound of people gath'ring fast,â Not to lament the conqueror they've lost, The pride of Egypt and the ancient world, But, while with feigned grief they gather round His bier, in fact, to welcome MEâhis heir. Haste then: to meet them let us both repair. [Exit. [Curtain at back is drawn aside, disclosing a splendid scene; the King, as dead, laid out on a bier of purple, his arms grouped at the head of bier; behind is seen the entrance to the tomb of the Kings (beautifully engraved in colours. See Rossellini's folio work on Egypt. Antiquities), from which numerous Priests come out, bearing torches, symbolical staves, etc.; Mourners, Girls, etc.; Troops, Captives, etc., lining the stage, forming a magnificent spectacle (analog. to Sardanapalus. Costumes from Rossellini's and Wilkinson's âAncient Egyptians.â) Music. High Priest (coming forward). Priests, people, all; ye gallant warriors, Whom once Rameses led to victory; Ye captives too, who at his chariot-wheels Waited in chains; see all that now remains Of him so long the glory of the Nile, The conqueror of the world, the king of kings; With awe approach, and take one parting look, In turns advancing near his royal bier, While we to heav'n high raise our mournful strains, Before in pomp we take it 'neath the gloom And darkness of yon gorgeous regal tomb. Dirge. Recitative. 1st Jewish Maiden. Hear ye, my dear sisters? dejected slaves They ask to join their dirges at the grave Of Egypt's sovereign. How can we bewail The tyrant dread that held us in his thrall? No; we'll deceive them. While they think our sighs Are for the cruel tyrant, who there lies, We'll for lost Rachel mourn, and, from our eyes, For our lost of Sharon tears shall flow, As at Rameses' bier, like slaves, we bow. Priests. How is the mighty one laid low, Who swept the earth with sanguined sword! The light that shone has ceased to glow, The world hath lost its lord. Towers of MemphisâEgypt's pride And MeroÃ«'s time-honour'd pile, Rejoice no more; your glories hide, Your sun forgets to smile. Maidens. Where's now the lily, queen of flow'rs? Where now the perfume of the rose? The light that gladden'd Judah's tow'rs Is lost to us, as those. Why lost so soon, belov'd one; why And leave us only vain regret? Still shall thy spirit hover nigh To wake up mem'ry yet. Chorus. Mourn people/virgins mourn, for great Rameses/Judah's maiden mourn, And Egypt of its long-known glory shorn. Mourn great Rameses, noblest of his/sainted Rachel, fairest of her race, In glory/beauty peerless, as in grace. [Just after its commencement, Osmandyas enters, followed by Hophrah, and takes his place, kneeling in pretended grief near the head of the bier. Enter Nitocris, l. guarded. High Priest (after a pause, to the Queen). Before these blest remains, yon holy tomb, Destined so soon to hide within its walls The corse of him you erewhile call'd your lord, We now pronounce our sentence on you, Queen; (Looking round) And listen all, that ye may know we're just. You've been accusedâtoo many witnesses, Alas, can prove itâof adultery: Nay, e'en the King himself beheld his shame. This being so, by Egypt's sov'reign law (From which your regal rank exempts you not) The penalty isâto be stoned to death; Which sentence, when these mournful rites are o'er, Shall be inflicted at your palace-gates. Nitoc. (terrified). My child!âmy child!âwho will protect my child? Osmand. (coming forward). I will vouchsafe his weakness to protect, And train him to obey my sovereign will. In some low calling, if he's wisely rear'd, He'll soon forget the glories of the past, Too happy never to have known the name Of the unhappy one that gave him birth. Nitoc. (with dignity). Ye priests who doom me to this hideous death,â Ye people, too, in whose hearts I have liv'd,â (To Osmand. sarcastically) And you, too, prince,âso gen'rous, so humane, Who thus insult your victim at HIS grave, Whose happiness you've murder'd like my own: I should with resignation meet my doom Did it affect but meânay, hail the fate That reunites me to my sainted lord, From whom in life foul slander sever'd me. But, if I die, my hapless boy will lose His last support:âmy life is not my own, For I should live for him; so Heaven decrees, Ye priests, in spite of your inhuman laws. Yes;âand from you to Heaven do I appeal, (kneels.) And to Pahiroth's God. O Thou in Heaven, Oh! save meâsave me from these murderers' fangs! [Thunder heard. Osmand. Hark to Heaven's answer, Queen! The thunder's voice Declares the justice of thy punishment. As for Pahiroth (sneeringly)âhim, the vaunted seer, He's dead ere nowâseal'd in a living tomb. [Great sensation. (After a pause) Yes, priests, I acted rightly to avenge Our monarch and our priesthood both contemn'd By this audacious Jew. Well, let his God Deliver, if he can, both him and thee!â But why spend time in list'ning to her plaints? Come, priests, lead in the bier, the sacred boat; The Egyptians believed that the dead went to Paradise in a boat; and that, together with food for the fabled voyage, was always carried in their funerals. See Wilkinson. The vessels, too, bring in, and all due rites Fulfil. (To an attendant.) Give me this torchâI'll light you on. [Is proceeding to back to entrance of the tomb of the Kings, when Enter Pahiroth, meeting Osmandyas at back. Pahir. (stretching out his arm). Hold, scoffer, hold! [Osmand. falls back aghast. Nitoc. Pahiroth here again! Ch. Priest. Stupendous mystery! What! here alive, When you declared yourselfâ Osmand. (dismayed and terror-stricken). No, people, no, 'Tis not Pahiroth, but some fiendâsome ghostâ That has assumed his visage and his voice. Avaunt, cursed demonâback to hell, thy home! Pahir. I'm neither fiend nor ghost, but sent (pointing upwards) from Heaven! Hereâtouch my hand, Osmandyas! Scoffer! [Holds out his hand, but Osmand. shrinks, affrighted. Why shrink from me? Dost think this hand of mine Grasps the avenging angel's fiery sword; Or seest thou thy doom writ in my eyes? Osmand. Help, priests; support your fainting King! [They support him. Pause. He recovers. (Looking around.) Hophrah has played me false. Pahir. No; he was true, And did thy bidding to the letter, prince. To Heaven, not him, owe I my liberty. Priestsâpeopleâlisten: they seal'd up my tomb, Intending that of hunger I should die; But I had faith in Him who bursts the bonds Of death; and when I pray'd He answer'd meâ Unseal'd my prison-door, and set me free. A Soldier (coming forward). I was, O King! a witness of th' event. Ch. Priest. Oh, wondrous mysteries of Providence! Osmand. (aside). Strange!âvery strange! (Pause.) No matter; I'll secure By cunning, if I can't by force, the crown That now is mine. (To Pahir. coaxingly.) Come hither, worthy seer. I've been deceived: I own I've done thee wrong, And will in compensation for the ills I've done thee raise thee to high dignity. Come here, Pahiroth; come and share my throne. Pahir. Prince, the rewards I look for are not thine To offer; earthly honours have no charms For me; my aspirations higher mountâ To Heaven! For thee, unhappy prince, despair! The grave yawns for thee; Rachel beckons theeâ Thy outraged, murder'd victimâto the tomb! Ch. Priest. Shall we allow these insults to our King? (angrily.) Pahir. False priest, behold the issue of your work! While you profess to read the will of Heaven Among the stars, and in the victim-beasts Slain upon your altars, you cannot read The human face. Your King, ye said, was dead; As such you've mourn'd him, too; but look again! [Goes up to the bier, and beckons the Priest to draw near. Death has not laid his stamp upon his brow; He yet is warm; he's buried in a trance! (To the King.) Awake, Rameses, be thyself again, With all thy strength, thy reason as of old; Rise, and declare Nitocris' innocence; Acknowledge, too, the God thou hast denied! [The King rises, first sitting, looks round, astonished, etc. King (awakening). Where am I? Nitoc. (astonished, then overjoyed). What! my husband! still alive! King. Who calls me? (looks round.) Nitoc. IâNitocrisâI, thy wife! [Goes to the bier and kneels, embracing the King. To see thee living brings life back to me. Would it could bring my honour back as well! King (rising indignantly). Thy honour, love! who dares to question it? Who dares accuse thee. Come, tell me all at once. But stay. (Pause.) The truth is dawning on my soul, And, one by one, the scatter'd particles Are crowding on my shatter'd memory. My jealousy has wrong'd thee, I confess: But pardon me, and ope again thy arms. I'll tell thee all:âA female slave, O Queen, The victim of a villain's arts, had donn'd Thy regal dress. (Seeing Osmand. starts.) Ah! there the traitor stands! [Osmandyas falls at his feet. Inhuman monster! Move him from my sight, And let the punishment that he design'd For others be imposed on himâthe wretch! Drag him forthwith to the sepulchral cave In which Pahiroth was imprison'd, there To be confin'd until he pine to death. [Osmandyas is led off. Pahir. Thy enemies, O King, are all destroy'd;â Behold thy subjects kneeling at thy feet. King. Thy pardon, too, Pahiroth, would I claim. My sov'reign pride has justly had a fall; And Heaven, at whose decrees I basely scoff'd, Has vindicated His almighty pow'r. Nitoc. His majesty and glory let us sound, Priests, princes, people, all the nations round. TABLEAU.</field>
