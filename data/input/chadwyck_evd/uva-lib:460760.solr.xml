      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. —A Hall in the Palace of Blaquernæ. Henry Dandolo, Doge of Venice; Baldwin, Earl of Flanders; Prince Henry his brother; Montferrat; Bishops of Bethlehem, Troyes and Soissons; Flemish, French, and Venetian Lords. Doge. Dictate, young prince; what of thy kingly honour? Is it a hollow thing—a passing bubble, Such as boys make in green and yellow summer? Now, let us be decisive: Reverend Fathers, And ye, my worthy peers, we crave resolves That may do honour to our high appointment. Why are we here, when our great enterprise Looks to the Holy Land, from its bless'd shrines To drive the infidel? This had been done By our brave fathers, had not policy Or hate inspir'd the emperors of this East To thwart their measures: and, such power they have, For this their city locks the eastern world. Alexis sued our help—we help the weak. Yet farther were we mov'd to put him up Into his native seat, when the conditions,— (I shall not now say of his gratitude, For they have been the dictates of a heart That, in its weak and pining eagerness, Promises all things rashly, and foresees, Even in this largeness, an excuse hereafter;)— Yet, were they such that nations hail'd the hour, And thought it the near ordinance of Heaven, That we should gain a footing in this city, Toward our great design—this prince's favour, And more, his powerful and immediate aid. The rest is now before us; we have found him Quick in those changes that, in such a case, Denote as clearly as stiff opposition. When in our favour, they are mov'd by fear, Which, like the glassy sun that, in mid hours, Shines out betwixt the colds of morn and eve, And sweats the clammy brow of pucker'd frost But for a little;—softens his last nay, Withdraws again, and only proves at last That nought can give a hint to gratitude. The change, my lords, it seems, is now against us Since yesternight: but then his flag of peace Hung down to us from the wall; now on that wall Go armed figures nodding in new presumption. The gates are shut—the bustle of war is heard. My counsel is but how to choose the ground Of quickest action, and the disposition This moment of our strength—to use our arms. (Applause.) Bald. Wer't found, my lord, that we ourselves have made The prince an enemy—our own misconduct;— It might affect what you, not knowing all, Have wisely counsell'd—I should else be silent; But I am bound to see our purpose on— This might retard it; therefore do I speak. This thing—this outrage. Who, my Lords, could think That one of us would, in the peace of night, Shake friendly cities with the alarms of war; And leave us here to wonder at the effects, Nay, more, to move whole armies at the issue Of one man's folly. Doge. Are we all here? 'Tis strange. Proceed, my Lord of Flanders. Bald. I may be rash, and this no cause of war— Mont. As if his deeds should shun the light, Lord Earl: Wind up thy cold insinuating coil.— Had he been here, for whom I'm proud to speak, Young Montmorency, he had started forth And nam'd himself at mention of this thing. A private message from the emperor Came to his tent last night—“Bring thee a guard, And take thy bride; she waits thee in our palace: All things are ready 'gainst the nuptial hour.” He went: the gates were shut, a force within, Taunts for a reason—and a shower of darts. Now stand forth he that blames my noble friend; By Heaven, he had not been that friend this moment Had he come tamely off. His sharp reply Was all too little. So much for this grievous outrage, and too much. Here's Montmorency. Montmorency enters. Doge. (rising.) How may we honour one so high in war! Brave Sir, we have resolved to arm this day, To win where patience fails. Look to it, Greek! Herald of thine shall show no peace-flag here, Till he hath borne another embassy. Our war shall ring within thy palaces, And climb thy towers, and pull thy flag-staves down. Mont. My troops are under arms.— Who now shall give me leave to tell my news? Or will you swear to avenge him ere I speak?— Who starts not now? O I have been too slow. That messenger should have a thousand tongues To clamour on before him, as he goes Rousing the earth to vengeance, who must speak Of such foul deeds. The prince is foully murder'd. Doge. Rise up, ye princes, hear this thing in sorrow. Brave knight, you talk'd of murder? will you go on. Alexis murder'd! Did you say by Murtzoufle? Mont. Would one of these brave lords could meet that monster:— Usurper too, now from the throne of Greece He casts his gloomy shadow. Noble Doge, It is my private interest to cry war, Else, would I speak: save me too from presumption, And speak for me a thousand burning words, To drive up vengeance: or, but name the deed, And men shall pluck him down.—Hear me, my lords! Are not your tyrants politic, though cruel? But his a soul so gross he sees no need To keep the deed within its bloody bandage, But forth it bursts at once, and groans to the world From the dark hangings of the murder-chamber. Now, shall that man be king? Doge. No: parricide He shall be held, and foul as beastly rites Done on the dark undiall'd hour of midnight. My lords, we're not yet done: Mark our first duty.— He was a prince that, but for evil counsel, And one vile traitor-man, had earn'd his praise For good judicious acts. And it is ours To do all justice to the dead, the more, We have been led to put him to much blame. Let's now reverse our sentence, and believe That bastard counsel oft usurp'd the right Of his own justice—a much elder brother. Alas! who does not mourn for him, so young, So full of life? The green wheat of his years Is stricken down in summer—who does not grieve? God rest thee—thou art ashes, Prince of Greece. Were I now young;—but I shall say no more— Ye are my sons, and braver far than I.— Up, swear to avenge this deed! Ye Holy Fathers, We are permitted so to do?—High Lord Bishop of Bethlehem, thy advice shall weigh. Bishop of Beth. Although in every pettiest state there be Appropriations, not to be interfered with By other states; yet, if such government Cannot control itself in desperate times, But it become a sore upon the world; Not better right has this, my own right hand, To cut infectious finger from my left, Than other nations have then to correct it. Places there are which men have sanctified, The great high places of the social world. And, when the leprosy of unclean feet Hath come thereon, all men cry, “Purge it clean.” When princes die by treason, it affects Less a particular kingdom, though embroil'd, Than all the social bonds of earth, made strong Or weak in the awe and reverence of men. Arise, my lords, or now ye say to the world, (So much are ye engaged in these affairs, So nearly,) that ye hold such matters light. The prince was not allied to us by blood. We do the thing from reason then, not passion; And “vengeance yet is his.” Doge. This solemn wisdom Keeps us in bonds, good signors. Montm. Come on, Montferrat. Bald. Henry—my Lords of Flanders— Doge. And we of Venice—shall we be last in this? But stay, brave signors, and give ear a moment:— Still have I found a rash unbottom'd haste Settling, ere long, like cold indifference. Then let us hold it wisdom to enforce Our present ardour by proportion'd reasons. Our claims are not extinct, and shall be answer'd For our own sakes—for the late prince's sake, Who had been faithful, but for evil men. And, hark! there is an empire in this East, Not far from our command. How dread were they That could to Palestine bear mighty name; Conqu'rors of Greece, and have its power at will. The dusky infidel would bow at once, And the dread shrine be free. If we are not these men, what must we be? Why, nothing more than desp'rate of success, This tyrant in our sides a dreadful thorn. Why need I mention first crusades? They failed, As we must fail, this power unless controll'd, Destroy'd, or gain'd. Most reverend Bishops, speak, and, if you may, Speak from the conscience, give us your approval; It much concerns the church to gain this city. Bish. of Troyes. Brothers of Bethlehem and of Soissons, Most noble Doge, and all ye other peers, In former days a holy bishop thus, (Bishop of Langres) counselled Lewis the young:— “If ye would thrive in this great enterprise, (He spoke of the crusade,) ere you pass farther, Seize on Constantinople.” Now these words Of high authority were given, a prince, A lawful emperor on this throne of Greece. 'Tis not so now—a hateful tyrant's there. Doge. No more. Montferrat, Baldwin, lead the blind man forth To arms this night. One on each side, brave knights, Would I could see you both. [Exeunt. SCENE II. —A public Place in Constantinople. Two Citizens. 1st Cit. A bloody business! Will he come this way? 2d Cit. Hush! he must be here now, unless he go Round by the Hippodrome: 'tis throng'd with people. Men think he will harangue them: not so I; I know him better. He must come this way To make the tour of the walls; for he expects A red hand from the west, from Suabia, To pluck at him, besides these Latin powers. Enter first an immense Mob, then Murtzoufle and Soldiers. Murtz. Halt for a moment.—Ye be men of Greece, As I presume. If ye have aught to offer, Prayer or petition, ye shall find to-morrow All courts of justice open: this shall be For ever, if this right hand thrive to keep you From those, falsely called, emp'rors who abuse you, And the dread sword, that from without o'erhangs you Now, stand aside. All. All hail, our noble Emperor! Murtz. Aside—aside—that word's for times of peace. I am no emperor till I free this city From all this noise of arms, that nightly knocks And shakes the sleeper's dreams. I have you up From those that held you prostrate. Go to sleep. Ho! Pedro. Arm these men, and bring them on To the western wall— (The crowd runs off.) [Exit. Murtzoufle and soldiers. SCENE III. —The French Camp on the west side of Constantinople. Montmorency's Tent. Montferrat and Montmorency. Montf. The prince and I were walking round our tents In that wild Thracian plain: far off was heard, Among the hills, the harsh and mournful music Of the barbarian trumpet, now less dreaded— There stood that soldier.—“Ho! a messenger!” Alexis cried, as he stood in our path;— “I am no messenger, save to myself, “To cry, prepare, and sweep thy house, to-night: “Death is thy guest,”—the touch of waning light, That lit his restless orbs, grew more intense. “More than a messenger—beware!—beware!— “Yon sun that walks among the western trees, “And shines red through this bloodless hand of mine; “Looks on thy falling state, and thy young reign; “Worm-eaten and done, if dark Murtzoufle thrive “Up to his wishes: his the crooked spirit “That worms itself into the world's best things: “Beware! beware!”—He said, and fell in death. No man knew whence he was—Was it not strange? Montm. I thought him dull as earth. Montf. As outer-wheel Whose slowest motion bids the loud turmoil Wake of a thousand hurrying powers within. Montm. There's a deep plague-spot on my soul for ever, 'Cause of that youth, whom I exposed to death So foolishly!—“Where is our poor Antonio?” Speak, devil—Montmorency, who but thou Bade him lie fast below cold-rooted woods? Heaven! were it possible, that if I bore For years—years—some bow'd torment, he might live, I'd do all—suffer all: for him this hour's Filmy and dull as eye of new-cag'd bird.— Ah! who shall tell me of my new-cag'd bird? Hast thou seen Philip? Montf. Ay. Montm. He shuns me still; Therefore he knows. Montf. He heard it all most calmly. Montm. Would he had rather yell'd, and loudly curs'd, And left that dark eye nothing more to say.— Montf. 'Twere well that you were rid.— Montm. Not so, by Heaven! I've done him grievous wrong; slain poor Antonio— He is too proud, else would I trust him still As my physician. Montf. 'Twere most dangerous: I may be rash, but his soul seems to me Secret and foul, as bed of old black river. His cold indifference I have thought a mask That hides a coil of crooked thoughts: that face Of icy breadth:—those glassy eyes that stand— Montm. His is no common soul:—luxurious tastes— A strange avidity for knowledge—cold To all save his Antonio, whom he lov'd Like little child:—Still I have never thought him One to be feared, but, if he wear the mask, So long it hath been fixed, so closely, 'tis For dreadful purpose: Then, indeed, his thoughts Are foul and pois'nous, as the knotted worms, That breed in cold beds, 'neath the unwholesome stone That never hath been rais'd—I fear him nought. Montf. Yet, trust him not too much—(trumpet)—hark! hark! hark! hark! Look too—yon ruddy flag; there let all winds Assemble there; wave't fiercely: Welcome still— The warrior's voice, and hunt it through the fight! Montm. Ay, fortune strives To keep our plumes of soldiership in trim. My Lord, may we not come on them at once, And burst our way into this walled town? O! for this maid, Eudocia.—Hark! it chides us— (trumpet.) Montf. Now, let us climb upon our mounting blood, And show the tokens of that stern revenge That shall o'ertake him if he rob thy love. Enter Philip. Montm. Philip! Phil. Ay, Philip: what more might he add? Montm. Antonio's brother: Montmorency's foe. Phil. A curse! O curse! But it shall shape itself Where it shall cling; and may it weigh down those That slew my boy—Dids't bury him? Montm. Yes, yes; Forbear for ever, hate me or forgive. Phil. Would we had equal power, that a stern feud Might bid a sharp sword ever run between.— Montm. Meet me to-morrow. [Exeunt Montferrat and Montmorency. Philip solus. Hunt him to all extremes; To come upon his sleep, to track his path, Keen as night-wolf that strides o'er the hoarded chests Of mountain snow.—Did thy young blood come out?— To strike his haughty forehead to the ground— Perhaps, even now, the raven comes for thee To peck thy frozen cheek. God rest thee well, My boy! but thou shalt rise, and the Great Hand Shall come from out the cloud, and kindly wash Thy face from the dishonours of the grave; And hold thee up, and thou shalt dare to look On the clear white brows of the holy saints. Where then am I, and what?—Well, I must thank him That he did cover thee. But thou art gone From me, and this dead heart, with all thy love, Sweeter to me than April showers to earth, That dip their wings in sunshine. Why, poor youth Dids't love this haughty Lord? I've followed him, Because of thee: And I shall follow him; Because of thee—O!— [Exit Philip. SCENE IV. —A Room in Euphrosyne's Palace. Eudocia and Zillah looking from a window. Zill. Lady, 'tis scarcely night: The moon is rising o'er Chalcedon's towers, Above the Asian hills: dim forms of eve, Their earliest shadows see: faint gleam the dark And woody shores of the swift Bosphorus. The lover will not stumble in his path In such a night:—and he shall come, my lady. Meanwhile, our tale— Eud. It is too tedious: well— Zill. Wouldst thou not hear Of eastern princess and her Knight of France? Eud. Lov'd she him well? Zill. Thus stood he, haughty warrior, Motionless thus,—his arms on his high breast, ('Twas when they parted, he to the Thracian fight, And she to stay with Hope, War's youngest sister:) Motionless thus,—and smiling on her care, To fix on his crest her favour, as he told Young maidens do in France. With hurried hand She tried each point, and look'd not up: A flash Burst from her eyes, at length; it spoke of honour. And then she smil'd—in tears, and she did stumble, Leaving the garden, in the clear path: She looks As if the days were very wearisome;— Trust me, she loves him deeply, and he her. Yet came her knight from war, then, O glad meeting! Such as the anxious heart dares picture forth, In all her hopes, not frequently; such bright Contingencies of joy, safety, and honour; As if she could deceive high Heaven, and say— 'Tis yea, or nay—in secret fear to think, What men most doat on's quickly ta'en away; From battle he came; then why not come to-night? Eud. So sweetly eloquent, thou Arab thing! So full thine eyes of love's quick pantomine; Maid, thou wert born his young interpreter To duller hearts: yet, somewhat sadly sweet.— He is not in the garden,—all is still, He will not come to-night, he cannot come, Nor send a little messenger to-night. How many maidens weep at this lone hour, And all because of love some mourn for wars, That leave dark days with lovers; some o'er death; Some wander now upon the carpet sands, Dropping full many a tear upon the edge Of the fast-flowing wave, and mourning lovers, Far away gone upon the world of seas.— Hark! there again! that strange uncertain noise, That sounds like echo of some falling throne. To-day, I have not seen a living form, Save thine, my little Arab—something dread. Enter Marsas. Here Marsas comes, that ever brings good news, Whose smile's an ever-green:—What! wo-begone! Mar. Wo! wo! our prince is murder'd by Murtzoufle. [Exit Marsas. Eud. And I must fall too.—O this dreadful night! Hearest thou, Zillah? hast thou seen to-day Lady Euphrosyne? O, she will come, And lead me onward to his lurid love, Where human feelings come not: if they come, Like shrubby flames that live to nod and dance O'er vaulted fires a moment—they are gone. Enter Euphrosyne. Euph. I take this hour to speak to thee; and glad, Most glad, am I to hope, thou art not chang'd From the obedient maiden that ne'er griev'd A mother's heart: and now, my love, must be Obedient farther: Cans't thou read my thoughts? Eud. Madam, they bid heaven bless thy daughter's life. Euph. And—love? And wilt thou thank me for my prayer? It has been heard, this night shall see thee wed. Eud. I will not fear a mother's words, my lady. Euph. Eudocia, be not foolish: think not, wench, I mean that foolish passion which you spake of. I'll drag thy spirit to my present purpose. Eud. Those eyes are fearful; see they not thy daughter? Euph. They see a scornful maid, that tries to steal Away from a mother's blessing, as 'twould sting. Eud. My honoured mother, what shall I do for thee? Art thou not well? then let me bring my harp. Troubled to-day?—I know it by thine eye.— A lively air shall dispossess the pain And fill thy breast with peace. You know how oft For you it has been blest: not for myself, But you I mourn, that we are brought thus low. Euph. Ay—ay thus low. And shall not she be blest That strives to rise, to raise her fallen mother? Eud. Would that I could! Zillah, maid, bring our harp. Euph. No; stir not, maiden. Eud. Shall it not be to-night? Euph. Ay—ay to-night—now understand that hint. Eud. Oh! is it so? thy words then have a meaning To gather up my spirit into knots Of curdled ice. Alas! I feared thus much, And tried, (false maid) to give thy thoughts the slip. And yet I thought my fears might all be vain. For, pardon me, I never thought my mother Would strive to wreath me with those bloody bonds. For Heaven's sake, urge me not. Euph. This is more strange Than savag'ry, or any whim in woman. What would'st thou have? What be if not a queen? Eud. Nothing: or death and grave before this bridal. Heaven cannot bless it. Euph. No; it never shall; For, wench, in vain thou wouldst have Montmorency. Eud. Let me live for thee. And with thee all my life, Euph. This mockery now O how I laugh at it, and think how vain! Eud. What shall I say then, madam? Mother, thou, And yet no mother! for my heart refuses To take thy loath'd proposals, stain'd with blood— That blood an Emperor's—a relative's.— What! must I wed a furrow'd curse, that clings Till it grows old—stretch towards the bloody bosom Of this usurper? O how men would loathe— And matrons weep, and maidens hide the head— And future times abhor me; and pure Heaven Hold back the head far, far, not to see her, The daughter of Euphrosyne, so foul. No; rather drown me in a sea of blood. I said, good madam, that I have no wish: 'Tis true, if any wish yields this condition, That I must wed Murtzoufle. O no, no! Let me no more disturb thee—let me live— But name not this—unheeded as the spider That works in cool and silent palaces; And want thy face, and commune with no light, Rather that this. Madam, I ask thee nothing. Euph. The credit thine, maid, for this moderation: It shall be given thee, therefore, though thou ask not; Nay, more, against thy will—a murderer— That, wench, or what thou wilt; so he be prince And thou his wife, if he will have no other. The shame mine own that I have been unfit To bring a princess forth: a peasant thou! A peasant girl.—Now praise humility, And I shall list a moment, and then speak, And not in vain, else I have borne in vain The pangs of travail in thy birth—go on. Eud. I cannot speak, unless Heaven dictate words To move thy soul; but surely it enjoins Humility on man, whose life is breath. If I might care for royalty, it were But for thy sake, for I would rather be My Montmorency's bride, and in his France Queen of a vintage feast, than Empress here. In this I mock not Heaven, calling my wish Humility, for I have been most proud Of Montmorency's fame. Euph. No; but you think All this is well.—Proceed—I'll hear thee out. Eud. If I have been as thou thyself hast said, In all things dutiful since infancy, Cannot I move thee in this one request? Euph. Now you have done. Eud. Stay but one moment, this is it then, all.— (kneeling.) Bless me and Montmorency. Do it, lady. Thou art not frail as woman, and will do it Because t'were strange, perhaps. Euph. I speak no words Of burning wrath, but keep them in this bosom. If for thy love, (which did I look it straight, Would wrinkle up a brow of scorn beyond The power of ninety years,) if for this love You ask my blessing; thence, I'll lay on thee A dreadful word. Eud. Heaven cry no! Speak, too, Arab, If I have taught thee, love, a purer faith. Euph. Good Zillah—Madam, Murtzoufle comes this night and weds thee. I set him on, but he's a hungry lion, That, tasting blood, wont bear control. Mark, maid, I could not help thee now did I so wish. This very night, I can but say, Prepare— Look to thyself—'tis seal'd—we are constrained— This very night. Eud. O Montmorency, haste! Be as a post of wind or glimpsing sun. Euph. Louder, thou fool. He hears thee not; and ne'er shall hear thee more. Eud. Hark! O thou dost not know—there sounds the battle; (sounds without.) And there, perhaps, the stroke of Heaven to strike The tyrant down or reach this heart a blow O kinder than that smile. Euph. I did but laugh to think how far he's hence Beneath the city walls, and haply slain, No more to see thee, did he live an age, Unless Murtzoufle show thee from the wall To mock his rage. That rage is impotent,— And all the Latin arms. What next, my love? Eud. Then, Zillah, bring the harp, no lively air This lady wishes; we shall have a dirge, And I shall die, for yet I love my love And ne'er shall be another's: I'll but wait To learn the worst. Euph. Unseal thy fount of tears, Poor shadow of a Queen. I'll not be back But send the messenger—the messenger. (Exit. Euph.) (Eud. stands looking after her mother's steps a long while.) Eud. Where art thou, Zillah? (to Zillah.) Why weep'st thou, silly girl? it aids us not. Hath the owl been at my casement? or was that Hail, the quick dancer? or Death's finger-bone That struck my window? Zill. O speak not so, my lady. I heard no sound. Eud. Where then is that tall woman That stood beside me now, and touch'd my arm? O, ay—my mother. But she shall not fly, I'll follow her through all the city, and kneel. (Goes out.) (Returning.) Come to our chamber, Zillah, And be he fiend, I'll be Eudocia still And Montmorency's. [Exeunt. SCENE V. —Below the Walls of Constantinople. Enter Montferrat with his sword drawn. Montf. Holla! De Choisy! the north—the north! De Ch. (Without.) —Holla, holla,—here are the city gates. Montf. Keep to the northward, and aloof from the wall; Stand! who goes there! Enter De Choisy. De Ch. Did'nt you call me now? Montf. Have you not seen him? De Ch. By yon star, 'tis madness: I think it be the pole—I told thee so. O many a brave head have I turned up here, And trod among their mutterings—till my limbs Have lost economy. Where are the troops? For I must rest an hour. Perchance to-night— Montf. 'Tis no perchance, for by what star you will; By the wind-managed crescent of yon moon, That with sharp sickle reaps the clouds of heaven, Our battle must be reap'd again this night. God help the harvest; we move in an hour: You'll find our troops a little to the westward: See that the rams are ready; for this night Their burly heads must butt against these walls. The ladders are prepar'd: we'll climb to-night— Ambition—you know, ambition.—Go, speak bravely, And show high spirit in presence of the troops. Noise it abroad—the standard of Saint Mark, O'ershadowing, wav'd upon these battlements, Unrais'd by mortal hand,—That we of France, This night have ta'en the Holy Virgin's image, Which Grecian Emp'rors were often wont To van their battles with, in hopes of victory: Adding, that she, to whom great Constantine The Imperial City gave, hath given it up; And with her banner and her image come To guide our entrance:—This is more than wine To soldiers' hearts. I'll be with you anon. Holla! [Exit De Choisy. Without. Holla! Montf. Hither, thou weary footstep. Enter a Soldier. Art thou last? Sol. Some stragglers yet are out; but search is vain.— Two soldiers who were resting in the camp, Not knowing at first our search, but, having heard, Came straightway to inform us of his capture. I heard them swear just now, they saw him lost Beneath the gate, what time the salliers fled, And our pursuit was hot. They saw him first Close on the enemy's heels: the rush came on, When he was fighting 'neath the gateway arch, And sway'd him in.—The dreadful leaves were shut, And he was seen no more.—I heard them swear it. Montf. Enough, good soldier—go and take some rest.— [Exit Soldier. I lost him in a moment, when he rush'd, A bloody wedge, making a way for death Towards these cowardly gates. He's captive now, And all his love blown out. Were it myself, 'Twere but a soldier's fate. Alberti passes. Montf. (Coming forward.) You are of Venice? Alb. So please my Lord; Alberti. Montf. Who has not heard of thee, brave gentleman? What think you of Murtzoufle now; shall his power last? They say he is strangely cruel—have you not heard? Alb. Forgive me, God of battles—thou hast saved me,— That I have not yet knelt, O for brave friends Captive this night, and in that monster's power! O help them well on narrow rueful bank, 'Twixt a late safety and a near destruction. Sir, I do think, without the glimpsing arm Of a Great Power quick between heaven and the earth To save them, they must die. Montf. Is't so indeed? But do you mean—think he dares slay his captives? (Kneels.) Then must I kneel too.—Our brave friends indeed! (Rising.) Now are our souls decisive. And time calls— Hot work to-night,—what gain'd with you? Alb. A little. But let me tell mine errand—I am sent By our prince Dandolo, to learn the issue In this your quarter. Montf. Montmorency's ta'en, Which more than balances a thousand fights Of our success. But let me ask of you,— My forward eye was often drawn aside, As starting from behind the angl'd wall Toward the north, the fire-ships shot upon you With sudden blaze. How did you 'scape destruction? Alb. The walls were crowded with a thousand faces; And young and old were there to see us burnt. Seventeen great chelandies before the gale, That stiffen'd from the West, came blazing on, Wrapt in their windy flames, upon our middle, Where we to the leeward lay: But we were quick:— Our skiffs and long-boats in a moment fill'd With our brave fellows; spite of all their darts, We push'd them on each other: then, with hooks And mighty grapplers, from their place we drew them Into the channel; there the winds and current Claim'd them: the waves reveng'd the mockery Of all their fires; snouted them on and on: And the wind did its part on their bare sterns, And drove their wispy flames, that hung before, Far to the eastward into the Propontis, Where they soon bubbl'd into nothing.—Then The clapping and the shouting had an end. Montf. There has not been a braver deed than this Since ship first touched the sea. Brave sailors, you. Commend me to the Doge;—tell him, to-night We mount the walls, or die.—Move you to-night? Alb. Thanks to that question, I had else forgotten. The great ships with the drawbridge-ladders first, The galleys next, shall on: and all are ready: The Paradise and Pilgrim in the van, Together bound, shall make to the strongest tower, Upon the wall. Each tower shall have a pair Of twin assailants. Montf. Blow your trumpets loudly At the first onset; ours shall answer you. 'Twill animate our fighters. Alb. Let me pause— There's nothing more. Heaven strike with you, brave sir. [Exit Alberti. Montf. O God, Sir—think too of our Montmorency, So tell the Doge—commend me thus and prosper. [Exit Montferrat. SCENE VI. —Murtzoufle's Camp within the walls—Watchman walking on the walls—Troops drawn up. Enter Murtzoufle armed with a great mace, Pedro behind with soldiers. Murtz. (Striking the ground.) —Shame on us that we let this petty war Thus swell above the high brim of our city— Thus cling around us. Can't we then be brave? I'd rather be a bellows-man to Vulcan, Than strive to warm these men that move like life Beneath the far cold ice-drops of the north. Ho! Pedro! well? Ped. My Lord, all's right. Murtz. Ay, they can keep their feet, The stations are all set: But have you cramm'd The towers with engines? Ped. Knock, for Pedro's life, If they compound with death—all fix'd, my liege. Murtz. The fire-pipes ready? Ped. Ready—ay, most ready: Dry in the chops, and thirsting for a draught Of liquid fire:—down go their serpent streams, Down—down, the red guests of their inner-cabins. Murtz. These Frenchmen at our gates? Go, send them on. Ped. Would that they were. Murtz. So, so, these men more brave? Ped. Most brave, my Lord. Murtz. Thyself? Ped. My liege must answer there. Murtz. Most brave, In words and reasons: give me reason then Why we can't conquer, if we sally forth. Hold—where's our prisoner? Ped. At the western gate, There guarded, till we know your Highness's pleasure. [Exit Pedro. Murtz. Ho! there upon the wall, how looks the west? Watch. Nought stirring there. The north is quiet too, Save moving lights upon the Lycus' mouth. The ships are indistinct, but I can see, By the hung lights, men moving on the decks Built up the masts to overtop our walls,— Some mighty bustle.— Enter Pedro and Montmorency guarded. Murtz. Let them stir to-night, And Montmorency dies. Montm. How must I answer thee? There needs no hint That I am in thy power: Murtz. This youth we know, And judge him worthy of a hint, lest now, He scorn that power. But say, my Lord of France, How crows are frighted, and the paltry birds That eat the corn. Montm. Speak, tyrant, speak at once; And let thy blows be oaths unto thy words. For thou hast torn the laws of God and man, And dug up life: Strike,—for I hold thee brave: To brave the vengeance that shall hunt thy steps. Am I another victim? Murtz. Ah! my Lord! You've won me now to spare thee from—suspense. Hark! we're on terms of candour—then, by Jove, My only God, thou art upon my list; And that ye spake of vengeance and my scorn Of what men can, I write it down a hint, That you pray not too long. Montm. Thy soul is dusky as the land of Ham, More foul than the sea deeps, so very deep, That send a steam of blackness to the top, And hide all hoary filth. Ha! art thou not Murtzoufle? Bubbles dancing to their death, Must have their tricks; but dare you overcrow The hearts of men? You dare not strike—down tyrant! Murtz. Perhaps 'twere best to keep Thy scorn, to bring thee help some minutes hence. (A trumpet sounds from the north, then one loudly from the west.) Ho! there!—and there!—that I may rise to tell That trumpet calls thee? Montm. 'Tis Montferrat's blast. On—on, my Lord, ere I be done to death. Or give me vengeance—Hear, Murtzoufle too, The clock strikes for us both. Murtz. (To the Watchman.) —Speak, villain, speak, Hast thou not seen yet? Watch. Then, my Lord, they move, Both west and north. Murtz. Your pardon, knight of France, Did you not say?—Alas, poor youth, 'tis true, Thy friends regard thee not: Hither they come, All hot in arms: Or did you speak of her, Thy love, but now my bride? Montm. (striving to break his chains.) Unbind me, Sir, And know and fear the laws of men. Ah, tyrant, What didst thou say? Murtz. I'll swear it. Montm. That's the word That smites me sorely. Hurl me down the sea, That booming waters may devour the sound— O for it plagues my ear. Ay, ay, of her;— If thou art human, say thou did'st but move A jest to keep me from the thoughts of death. Nay, thou art kind, if it was only feign'd To add to death. Murtz. Quick—bear him off. Montm. I cannot die in chains— (Struggling.) If thou art soldier, free me, or this moment Strike me down dead, that I may hear it not. Murtz. This night I wed the maid. Montm. But not this night.— O haste, Montferrat, haste—run with the lightning.— As Heaven is just, most horrid tyrant,—no. That fiendish laugh's a prophet—it foretells Thy purpose, shed like water. (Pedro and Soldiers guard him out.) Murtz. Ho! Pedro! (Pedro returns.) No death, until we see He cannot be the cause of drawing off, And humble peace. Ped. Must he be haughty still? Murtz. Ha! thou'rt a devil.— [Exit Pedro. Now to the western gate— And who has fears, let that man stay behind, And give the brave more room. [Exit Murtzoufle and Soldiers. SCENE VII. —Euphrosyne's Palace—Eudocia's Chamber. Eudocia and Zillah seated on a Sofa. Zill. Thou art not sad? Eud. Nay—nay. Zill. O tell me why, And not afraid? Would that I were so too. Eud. Did I say no? Why did you ask again? O! 'tis because I have no hope on earth: But, list—and nothing comes—'tis all a dream,— The marshy fears of maidens, fed by mist Of tears and sighs. Let's laugh together, maid. Zill. 'Twould frighten me; but fear not over much. Eud. Perhaps he's wise though bloody, giving these hours To old-eyed counsellors and nightly wisdom. Zill. Hark! shall we say this bitter night is past? How go the hours? Eud. Hush, let them slip, lest our alarm should wake, With breath infectious, the dread power without That seems to slumber. Zill. I dare not be silent, But I shall whisper. Why thus look, sweet mistress, On yonder door? Go to your eastern lattice And feel the breath of Heaven, for you are pale. Be not afraid, it looks upon the sea. No cruel shapes of men shall fright thine eyes. Stay only till you count the little temples That gleam upon the dark and woody shore: And I'll remind you, as you told me once, These votive temples are memorials old Of sailors' hap by sea, when they were sav'd In the last peril. We are in peril too; But there's a God of power, and all the worlds Lean on the shoulder of his attribute: And God will save—more kind, and greater far Than the old Grecian's fabl'd deities. Eud. I dare not lift mine eyes from off that door, Lest he should enter. Is not this most fearful? The hours shall never wade through this dread silence. Zill. I dare not sit. I scarcely know thy voice. Eud. I'll walk along the chamber once or twice. Watch yonder door. Zill. Now—now—but go not far. (Eud. after walking goes to the window, but starts back, screaming.) Zill. My lady, O! Eud. Was it you that shriek'd? Zill. Thyself, Eud. A stork came flapping to the window light; I thought, at first, it was a fearful hand. I'll look no more. Shut out the sickly light; It makes my heart faint: to my aching sense The moon is dull, and all things indistinct, As the ribb'd shadows of old graves in churchyards. Come, let us sit. Zill. You hear that noise, my lady? Eud. The beating of our hearts.—'Tis now the hour When the lone matron, from her hamlet lodge, Looks for her spouse into the moonlight ways, But hears no foot abroad in all the night; Then turns she in, and thinks of murder done In former days, by the blue forest edge, Which way her lord must pass: then tells again The cloudy tale to her that with her mother Watches, when younger sisters are asleep, And kitten winks before the drowsy fire. There comes her husband—Hark! it is the fight, The warriors' din. (Knocking heard at the door.) Is that a knocker's hand? (Knock again.) Hold fast, now door, and all ye senseless things Take arms for two poor maids. (Knock again.) Zill. What shall we do? Eud. Who's there? (Voice without.) Thy servant, lady, until death. Eud. 'Tis Marsas. Zill. You will not open?— (Eud. opens the door, and retires slowly to her seat. Eud. I know his soul too well: Good Marsas, I have ever bless'd thy words,— Come near and speak good news, (He retires to the further end of the chamber, and stands with his head down and his arms folded.) Then are you envious as these evil days: Each day brings deed that shakes the head at me. And each event, that passes, seems to turn Like cowardly assassin that would try Again the undone deed. But spare no word. Marsas. Do you know, lady, that Murtzoufle— Eud. Peace! And lock that door. Mar. Is Emperor of Greece? Eud. Ay—we are in his power. O Montmorency! Mar. You know all, then? Beware Murtzoufle. Our brave knight shall live. Eud. Ah! you have seen him? dead? who bade thee warn? Mar. Not as you fear. Eud. Is he not captive, then? Mar. His friend Montferrat's on, the Italian Doge With all their powers: the city shall be won; At least conditions that shall save the captive. And I was fool to frighten so my lady. Eud. O God! Where saw you him? Mar. Along the street. But fear not lady—for he look'd so boldly: No fear was in his heart, but rather rage At such indignity: his eyes were bent Like bows and shot, cramping their rings of fire; And anger burn'd with smoke upon his brow. Calm fell his look—for why? his life is safe,— Till when he saw me, then his restless eye Began to speak. Eud. O Heaven! and not to know The captive's wish. Mar. Lady, you know that wish— Well, on I follow'd, striving to get near, But the guards kept me back. I followed still— The guards retir'd—the keeper is my friend. I saw our Montmorency in his chamber. He has no fear but thee; and still he warn'd Of dread Murtzoufle. Eud. Are not the streets beset With armed men? Mar. The battle's in the west, And there the throng. Eud. Then, Marsas, watch our gates Short space until I call thee. Softly, Zillah (Exit Mar.) Follow my steps. Why sit you? Zill. Give me then, Lady, that dagger; for last night I dreamt With that same dagger did I dig a grave, A little grave to put Philippa in. Eud. Peace, and forget our fears—come. (Exeunt. SCENE VIII. —A Prison Cell. Montmorency walking the length of his chains. Montm. (Pausing.) The depths of slumber could not hide the thought,— And I must face it. Hapless maid for ever, Dost know thou'rt ruin'd? and perchance this moment— That moment's fled—and thou may'st be—for ever. 'Twould fright thee girl to death, to know what dread My soul has of this night.— (Walks.) (Pausing.) Step down, Eudocia, to the deep green sea— It is thy best—for look I help thee not,— Unless, unless you get within these walls. O! I would wrap thee with these chains, my love, My death to unwind them. Devil, would I not do Thy dreaded 'hests to rid me of these links? By Heaven 'tis strange, beyond my mem'ry strange, How this has happen'd; it seems a hurrying dream That I was captiv'd; and am now in bonds. Would, maiden, thou wert dead.—I cannot help thee.— Hark! there the bolts, harsh harbingers of death! My sword? 'tis gone—I fear to die unarm'd.— To give one's body to the gashing knife That's greedy to the hilt, and have no guard— I'd rather bow before a thousand foes With inch of sword—they come—I must stand thus. Enter Jailer. Com'st thou to do thine office? thou'rt but one, Come back with three; for, look ye, I am young, And shall not die without an awful struggle. Jail. I am not what you think. Montm. Not he that keeps The keys of these low shambles, turning bolts Through half the night? Art thou not he that holds His dark lamp thus above his head to ken His corner pensioners? that winks by day To grim-fac'd men, that slily trace thy steps, But shake their black beards at the fall of night, And roll dread words, like pebbles, 'neath their tongues? Dark man, is not thy hour-glass sand the dust Got on these low floors of the dead men's bones? Your pardon, if you have no wish to-night To catch me unawares—to stab my sleep. Jail. I am thy keeper, but I loathe the office. What shall I do to make thy chains less heavy? Montm. I have one wish, indeed,—but 'twere thy ruin. Why take them off?—you cannot—then I urge, Loose me these bonds an hour, and but one hour, By my soul's honour I shall put them on Within that space. Jail. And leave this place, my lord? Montm. Quick—quick unbind me. (Knocking without.) Jail. It is now too late. That noise—that knocking—cease a moment there. Why can't you cease till I have seen my pris'ner. Montm. Give me that dagger, there.— (Snatches it from his side.) Jail. Give me that dagger back. No? look ye, thou'rt captive, and I may revenge. But to thy breast with it, and hide it there Till it can serve thee. I was born in France. Montm. Look then, 'tis done. Thou hast a soul: but I can serve thee not. Jail. (aloud.) All's right within—why, don't you know my office? You noisy fellow, don't you know my hours?— (Exit Jail.) Montm. Why if 'tis thus, then must I say farewell To fame and all: my life has been a miss. Hence never day to me of high renown. And she—and she—O down thou bitter thought! They come, now welcome, 'tis the proper moment. These thoughts are turn'd to vengeance for her sake. Come, dagger, shake thy sparks. Enter Two Figures wrapt in cloaks—Door shuts behind. Ye have no voice within these hollow rooms? 1st Fig. Put up that dagger, and we speak, my lord. Montm. It frightens women,—if I know that voice. Thou art Eudocia? Eud. (throwing off her cloak.) Help, my lord, O help. Montm. These chains—these chains. Eud. Ah! thou must die. Montm. I cannot help thee, maid; And that is death; what seek'st thou in this place? I wish'd even this, but still my better thought Declar'd it foolish. Yet art thou an angel. Heed not these chains—embrace me—tears are here? Smile thy short minute ere I tell thee, maid, Our stars have look'd awry. Eud. I know—I know. Montm. Look at me, maid, for we can only say The fire burns deep that has no fringe of flame; So is our love the passion, not the hope.— O, I would leap on edge Of narrowest safety, could it bridge our fears:— Tug unto death: or stand till dawning thus, Might one half thought come with the morning-star To help my love. My soul is put to rack By that pale face; but I can't answer thee.— Eud. Brave youth, they dare not cut thee in thy strength. Montm. For black Murtzoufle finds thee out to-night, Or in the palace, or within these walls,— The city gates are his—and thou art.—No— Sooner death's coronal be on thy brow, His narrow ring upon the blue-vein'd finger Of thy consumption. Were I shut in with death, O'er his pale gate, I'd stretch and catch at thee Ere thou, my girl,— Eud. My lord, we'll match thee with a secret there.— (Taking out a dagger.) Montm. I see thee, love; but fly, the hour is come— This night his agent promis'd me a visit. Eud. I'll guard this door, and thou shalt cheer me on. Montm. Mock'st thou this shorten'd chain that I can't reach thee? Away, and seek the humblest hole to hide in, For thou art mine, and ne'er shalt be another's. Eud. Ah, Zillah, we must go, softly to tread This dark'ning world, and leave this youth behind. May Heaven inspire some lonely dweller's heart To meet us at the gate, and take us home, If this is not our home. We leave thee then, For we are troublesome. Ah, Montmorency! Montm. Still here? And not away? Ho, jailer! ope the door. Pause—come not near—I have a dang'rous thought— Curse on thy charms; but, maid, thou shalt not hence To be Murtzoufle's—time thou wert in Heaven. Eud. My lord—my lord— Montm. Then let me turn my eyes, that thou may'st fly Ere I behold. Eud. These chains are heavily borne; Then sit, my lord; and I shall stand the while And hear of this. Montm. These chains have now their weight. O thou hast bound me with a thousand fetters. I'm not unkind, but I shall kill thee, girl— This hand shall strike thee, for I dare not stay. Dost thou not fly me? Eud. I do not fly, my lord, Though I must die in youth:—but thy hand must not: Give me the dagger. Montm. O, no, no, we dream. Eud. This hand shall do it, and not thine. Montm. There—there. And grasp it thus. O 'tis not blown away! Where are Heaven's winds. Eud. (retreating out of his reach.) My lord the dagger's won. Montm. And thou art lost, false maid. Eud. 'Tis not thy hour— Thou art a soldier, and must win renown. Less surely does the mantling ivy tell Of mask'd decay; than hopeless love, the ruin Of the hot soldier. Let me die, my love; For I am ominous—farewell for ever: But weep not for me if you wish my death. (As she is about to stab herself, Zillah seizes her arm.) Zill. Forbear, forbear! some mercy in the dead! And shut your urns. My mistress shall not come At this so early hour. Montm. Whence came that form That I should worship?—(noise)—hark—O hark! come near, Let's die together. Marsas bursts in—Jailer follows. Mar. Joy—joy for all our years! the tyrant's off— The city won—Montferrat seeks my lord. Quick, he'll be angry that you stay thus long. (Montmorency and Eudocia embrace without speaking.) Montm. Art thou still here, my love? Eud. It should be morning, and the sun should shine O'er the clear world. O now I long to see Thy friend, Montferrat; I have never seen him. Montm. Follow me, jailer thou must be my soldier. Eud. Thy hand, good fellow, I'll reward thy love. And, Marsas, where art thou? Must I believe, For thy good services, the stars are worlds, Walk'd in by pure inhabitants as thou, Would'st have me think? Mar. But this is not the place; My lord shall hear me in these leisure days. Eud. (to Montmorency.) It is his fancy. Montm. Love and this is mine— That these star-figur'd mansions have no being Purer than she that would have died to-night; She whom I nearly slew. Jail. My lord, I am ready, let me knock these fetters. Eud. O now you're free. Montm. Ay, ay, I feel the change. Eud. There's Arab Zillah; lead her forth, my lord. Montm. I shudder to think how much I owe the maid. (He takes Zillah's hand.) Eud. Come, captive and all, come, and dungeons deep, Ne'er be you visited by man again. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. —Court before the Emperor's Palace. Montferrat and Philip meeting. Montf. Good-morrow, Philip, welcome to this city. Phil. My Lord! thy city. Montf. Why, Murtzoufle's off, Past through the eastern gate ere dawn. Phil. He has left His blood-cakes spread unto the moon to break, Before they baked. Pardon, my Lord—thy wound? Montf. Thanks to thy care, 'tis waxing well perhaps. Phil. It was not mortal only by an inch. Montf. Well, things in season, we may pile our arms. What! man look brisk—go shuffling through the streets. Thy face is not in season. Phil. I shall smile; For thousands say Montferrat shall be king. Murtzoufle set because he rose too soon. Start! from the horizon to the mid-day heavens, When men look'd for no star, there was he moving, Showing prime planet: but his stuff was crude: And now he's dull and flat, as leaden sea That creeps o'er the sunless shore. He took no pains To set his power on many points of base. Besides, though daring, he has wat'ry flaws 'Midst hardest stuff. A vulgar pride of heart Bullies men's eyes and casts no spots of care. Reckless he seems, but on the whole is coward. His prince he slew, and this which rais'd his power, Would soon have sunk him: for the dread suspicion Which murder breeds, prey'd on his nerve of power; And soon had made his reign a private care The bulwark of one life:—So much for tyrants That slack a moment on their dreadful stream. Add death to death, ye men that climb on daggers, Yet are ye fools. Montf. And thou art dangerous; So keen;—so keen:—when did you know Murtzoufle? Phil. Hints, hints, my Lord—a countryman of mine, Too quick for tyrant's use, has oft been near him. Yet had there been no merit to predict, The man unknown, the downfall of the power. Old worm-bit reign, like old annuitant, Oft longwhile hangs on crutches of decay; Like tottering wall, by shaking rubbish down, It heaps a sort of strength around its base. Not so the mushroom power of red usurper; Not back'd by desp'rate aids, and lucky hits, Quickly it falls a solitary strength. Well, such the guilt,—the folly—what you will,— The getting up. But O the glorious end! Above control:—the come and go to men: And vengeance too, we'll have revenge, my Lord; The wrath of princes lasts, old Homer sings. The power of secret things is at command; The marts of hidden knowledge: This his portrait;— (O I can draw the model of a king,) Accessible or not, no mid degrees; Proud as a burnish'd war-horse in the sun, Beauteous as wild beast of the wilderness; And somewhat cruel—and a scornful lip— And powerful gaze—and ever shy in peace; The soldier's ready spirit.—Go be a king. I call'd this city thine, and is it not? 'Tis fairly won. I saw the pomp to-day. Ha! ha! the cow'ring city cried for mercy, With young girls—and old girls—and boys and men; And show'd its wealth, more than humility. They look'd to thee.— I caught the truer sense of hoary men, They turn and say, Montferrat shall be king. Montf. Well, thou shalt be physician-general When I am king, astrologer or chief Of my state jugglers. Phil. Pardon, my Lord—thy wound Is full of pains? Montf. Ay, thou wilt be physician? Well, thou hast skill: in faith 'tis very sore. Phil. I knew it by thy words of twitching force. My Lord, I never jest—and mark at present,— There looks an Emp'ror:—and thy claim is best Of all our princes. Montf. We shall meet to-day. Phil. Ere then make int'rest. Montf. Make the devil, good fellow. D'ye think I shall be king? Phil. You may, my Lord. Montf. Why, there's the Doge of Venice; Baldwin besides, and Montmorency too, My gallant friend, with his sweet eastern bride, A princess of the blood, and near the throne. Faith, were she mine, I should not doubt a moment. Well boy, I care not, I shall o'er the plain To Palestine, the land of the bright swords.— (is going.) Phil. My Lord—a moment— Montf. I'll see you in an hour, And have my wound dress'd. Phil. You did'nt mean to mock me? Montf. No—thou art fool, if thou wilt not be juggler. Phil. And who is he that mocks the awful power, That reads the stars, the heraldry of Heaven; Whose aspects are th' escutcheons of all things, Plague and the earthquake, and the thunder-fires? I'd die that death, if I could know the power That burns from out the cloud:—o'er mortal life, It glances, and we die. The earthly fires Are awful as they go; and when they roost, With long-neck'd flames by night, in upper-chambers Of the old forest, when the wind blows dry, They do their work: but we can mark their path. Not so the out-bolts of black heaven that scathe, When the eye winks, a multitude of things— And then the hidden sea—I take thy promise. Now swear, my Lord, to give me means to search These secret things, when thou hast mighty wealth. Montf. Well, I have sworn, when thou hast made me king, To grant thee all. Phil. I'll cure thy wound, my Lord, This day—this hour. Montf. But stay—without the leave Of Montmorency you can't follow me. Phil. Aha! my Lord; but death Binds the wan tenants of his sepulchres. Murtzoufle sent him to the marble house. Montf. This morn he liv'd. Phil. Who saw him? Montf. Myself. Phil. But I am not his slave; and thou hast sworn. I'll cling to thee for ever. Montf. We'll look to that. [Exit Montferrat. Phil. I shall make interest for thee, If I can make some votes believe that thou, And not mine enemy, art this maiden's lover;— Eudocia serves me too—she serves the three. [Exit Philip. SCENE II. —Hall in the Emperor's Palace. Dandolo and Six Venetian Lords. Doge. Are we all met? 1st Lord. All met, the Six Electors. Doge. Then, mark me, signors, speak your minds at once, For I'm of Venice, and more proud to lead Her navies forth, than reign o'er all this East. This life is hers, and she has paid me well, For I have seen the wilderness of seas Flower'd with her ships: and she has been to men A visitation of delights: a bond To all the nations. Who durst think that he, Her son from youth—now in her battles old, Would yield the pride, and cast her highest honours? Not in the height of life, for highest throne, Would I this thing: God lay my hoary head In Venice—there I'll sleep. Brave countrymen My soul is knit to all: but not for me, Speak for our Venice—well I know your minds. You wish me Emp'ror of this mighty realm; (Thanks to your wishes,) on my own account: Not so for Venice.—Let your choice be hers. 1st Lord. Most noble Doge, 'tis so; thou good old prince, Reverence shall be thy staff—but let us speak And do thee honour, when we broadly say, Thou shalt not here be king. Who would not weep To see our city but an appanage, Or swallow'd up in monarchy? and this Might quickly be, were a Venetian prince Upon this throne. Long live our sea republic! All. Long live our Venice! 2d Lord. And her noble Doge.— I bow before thee, prince, to say, besides, As no contingency, without our aid, Or help of France, his empire could not stand. But here, for all, I swear, our country's strength Shall ne'er be wasted on such enterprise. Th' election rests between the Earl of Flanders And Marquis of Montferrat,—that's our point. 3d Lord. And that they both are powerful, and the choice A tender matter; let the Asian lands Beyond the Bosphorus—lands once the Greek's, Be his that fails of the throne. Doge. 'Tis wisely thought; As all have thought, whose counsel is before us: Thus Venice thrives, because her sons are wise As well as brave. I honour high Montferrat, Frank, and the better soldier; but Earl Baldwin Is wealthier far in men and wide domains. Earl both of Flanders and Hainault, he needs None of our aid: and mark, my lords, again, This brave Montferrat, with a power great too, So much our neighbour, might, in case of war, Prove dreadful enemy. The same objection Holds against Montmorency, our brave friend. Back'd by this power of Greece, we then might dread For Venice such a foe. Now, signors, judge, We meet the French electors in an hour.— Montferrat should have the Isle of Candia too, All. Long live the Emperor Baldwin! (Exeunt.) SCENE III. —Euphrosyne's Palace. Euphrosyne and Baldwin. Euph. So soon? 'tis but a day, my lord, one day. Bald. I go to-morrow—but for one event Of doubtful issue:—I may say 'tis certain.— And then to-morrow. Euph. But you cannot mean To-morrow—some hours hence to leave our city? O! ho! my lord, you put our fears to task? 'Tis but for a short while? Bald. I dare not think— But that three nights ago you understood me. I have no wish to see this city more. Euph. Then stay three days—a week—a little while— Until a prince be chosen:—stay and guard Our lives and fortunes; you were cruel else. Bald. This night shall do it all. My purpose still. Euph. Well, it must be so; but, my Lord of Flanders, You might have told us sooner. Bald. Madam, I could not. Euph. Ha! 'tis a different course. But look at me. Why art thou here? Does it not say, false Earl I have a right— Bald. One word on this for ever— Euph. Name it again; perhaps I heard not rightly. You said to-morrow? then shall I not speak? Coward, to let a woman fright thee hence. We swear, bold Flanders, we have no design Against thy life. Bald. Well there is nothing more— And higher purposes than woman's love— Euph. There is—you know there is—who's at thy side? Bald. No one, save fabl'd by deceitful sense, As it had serv'd thee when it whisper'd love. Euph. I see a figure moving thee to perjury. Bald. Why will you talk? Euph. I talk of thee?—'tis false. Bald. Then have you heard aright? Euph. A jest indeed! Be not perplex'd, my lord, there's no design Against thy person. Did'st thou think presumptuous— Softly, I'll call my servants—make them whip thee To give them due assurance, that we mean not To marry thee per force. Hence Earl of Flanders And of Hainault! False heart, O— Bald. Well Montmorency warn'd Too late I find. But we shall jest no more. (Exit Bald.) Euph. Stay, we are not yet done.— My soul, thou art a prophet 'bove them all. Thanks, Montmorency, thou shalt have the maid That calls me mother? Now for an Empress still,— And that's Euphrosyne. O for some mouth Invisible, to whisper in my ear How I may clutch them both, one in each hand! Enter Eudocia. So! who intrudes? Eud. It is thy daughter, madam. Euph. Did you not say to-morrow?—why then come? Eud. To ask thy blessing 'cause the time is short, And I may see my mother seldom hence. Euph. Thou shalt not mock me, for you hold th' event A riddance good: it is a riddance good. By Heaven thou shalt not mock me! Don't I say 'Tis a good riddance? Out, fool! steal away, It were thy best, if ye will love that knight, For I shall plague thee. Come to take advice Thy course determin'd? Eud. Heaven touch thy heart, and bless thee. Euph. Brave my words? Aha! I see it, wench, you said to-morrow? Eud. Ay, with your leave. Euph. You mean my leave, good girl? To-morrow, you said? Eud. So Montmorency wills. Euph. I did not think that you durst name him here. To-morrow—rebel? Eud. Then, madam, hear me speak— Euph. To-morrow—O! first answer me that. Eud. Were he not knight— Euph. (kneeling.) Kneel—kneel, he is not hind On the grey fallows at the break of dawn, A peasant lad: let us give thanks for this. (Starting up.) Maid, here I stand if you dare name it more. Eud. Then, lady, I must speak, and let me say Thy heart is troubled with distemper'd thoughts, Ambitious and more vain, of power to come; Because once we had power: and in this dream Thy days are passed, and bring thee only pain. And I must be a queen too, else thy nights Must bear these pains more heavily than the day, And thy couch be a sheaf of unturn'd thorns. And, pardon me, how could I give my youth To idle dreams, or deep intrigues,—forget My sex to catch an Emperor, haply old, Bloody, or mad? That man is high, indeed, Who for escutcheon has the world's loud praise. Euph. Trouble thyself no farther For I'm a dotard.—Last night's dream is vain As all my thoughts.—Why with me stay so long? Haste from thy mother. Eud. Were my life most full, And crown'd like Autumn on its golden pipes; More fears were mine, lest thou be in distress. Euph. Ha! ha! a patron? but, thou fool, come back, Nor run so far. Thy pardon, kindest maid, I did not mean to move thee; but my dream Saw angry faces of thy ancestors That peopled all my couch. This day's too gaudy, though it lours to earth; The tempest comes,—but yet there's too much light:— I'll seek thy chamber when the flakes of light Die on the windows, 'neath o'ershadowing eve, And desert streams grow dark, and tell my dream. Perchance we'll see their faces. Eud. Madam, why will they? was not Montmorency Nam'd 'mong the candidates for their own throne? And though Earl Baldwin gains it— Euph. What Earl Baldwin? Eud. My lady knows him. Euph. Dread power, catch thy news, And make them plagues for ye all—'tis false—'tis false.— But Oh! this head of mine! ye will not help— (She falls on a sofa.) Eud. Help here! O help! Enter Montmorency and then Zillah. Look there, my mother! Montm. Let me raise her up. Euph. (rising.) Hold off, nor blister me! Methinks thy touch Could raise me dead, to horror—thank thee once. Montm. She raves, my love! I'll help her to her chamber. Eud. Stay—stay! Euph. Thy lesson there—she knows too well, And she is wise, and she shall tell thee all. Ha! I have kept my purpose overhead When I was drowning: but she knows not that:— Both yet may know. [Exit. Euph. Montm. I fear her reason's touch'd. Eud. O no, my lord, she hates our love—'tis awful! Spare her and ask no more. O God! look down And bless my mother. Soldier—go—pass on; 'Twere best—for fate— Montm. Love, do not say the rest. Eud. O pardon me. How shall I leave her? I must farther grieve For thee, my country; all thy strength is cut: Strange wars have breath'd within thy palaces And dimm'd their lustrous boards. Henceforth thy light Is but the pale reflection of a strange sword Although for thee victorious. Montm. Theirs the shame, That for base gain forget a noble purpose. Eud. Ah! truant knight, thou hast forgotten too. Montm. Nay; love.—I've won a warrior to our cause; For thou must march with me to Palestine.— To-morrow dubs thee soldier. (Euphrosyne enters, pale, and in a night-dress.) Euph. Ha! to-morrow.— Who said the word?—the night is not yet pass'd. Montm. How shall I speak to thee, unhappy lady? Euph. Speak not to me, but look to yonder star. Montm. Thine eye's distemper'd. Euph. Is it dark to thee? So shall thy star be, that presides o'er love. There's thy pale shadow too, that sees no star. Sorrow shall lodge within her house of tears. (Eudocia embraces her mother.) Eud. O let me ask thee, is thy bosom sick? And hear: for I have said, no step of mine Shall tread on sacred fountains of my life. I do but say, farewell, to this brave knight.— Then bid me pour my life into thy wounds. Euph. My silence leaves to trial.— [Exit Euphrosyne. Montm. Thou, fair rebel, Did I not hear thee? Turn, thou holy maid; And for that name, and more that thou hast dar'd To trust a stranger youth with the proud secret Of princely maiden's love; if I have been Thy knight in war, and borne it on my sword, Shall I not farther honour the proud pledge, And own it worthy to be sav'd at once From each base plot?—Shall every foul usurper Touch, handle, tamper with its clear bright springs?— And, for thy mother—thou must pardon me;— She hates thee as myself;—thou wert her rival, In dark Murtzoufle's love,—or rather, power. Thou art in danger. But high be thy heart, Heaven's blessing is around thee, and thou stand'st In midst of it, like angel in the sun. If I might speak once for myself—high lady, See me still kneel, and humbly ask thy love. I hold thee dearer that thy mother frowns; By my soul's honour, more than other oath— What shall I say? I love thee as my fame: Thou must be soldier with me for a while; But I shall bring thee to the pleasant France, Where orchards rustle in the summer wind: And I shall love thee all my days of life. Eud. When I am tried, I'll call to mind what Montmorency said He'd do for his Eudocia,—and this moment, Do not I feel the thought bitter and sweet? If I am bold, 'tis that thou'rt Montmorency. That I have nam'd the name 'tis argument For sternest duty; else thou'rt changed indeed, And I the cause,—and thy high thoughts estrang'd. Show me thy sword—cloudy, my lord, or dull? O never, never—and you dare not bid me Hence, and not watch a parent's holy life. In grief, and who shall pluck her thorns away?— In anger, who should yield?—Heaven put us right! Were it not base to think my mother cruel, Still it were mine to say, I dare not fear. Montm. Were it not base to cloud thy holy purpose With thoughts of my own fortune, I would say Thy purpose cannot stand.—I must be proud. Shall each that knows my purpose of to-morrow, Hear it has fail'd, and plague me with conjectures?— The Patriarch at the altar waits in vain,— My fellows wait in vain,—and I must be Pitied forsooth, unless I bow to explain: No; for my own sake,—no, indeed, for thine. What, were the cause explain'd? Surely, my love, Not that thy lady mother fears for thee— Thy peace,—but that no more thou art her tool Of base intrigue. Happy were I, my princess, Thy own true knight in war,—proudly would go Behind the banner'd cross farthest in fight, Might my return presume to claim thy love. Thine were the dignity to draw my sword, And bind me where to put its farthest blow. But in the present place, where is the pledge Of thy due dignity to be my judge, Courted, assailed, by every rude usurper, 'Cause of a woman sick of the worst ambition? And where my meed, O Heaven and earth! thyself? I will be bold to boast, and that thou art My bride 'fore God; shall I not doubly swear, Thou shalt not be a word of course for each That dares to call thee means—a ladder-step,— A make-weight 'twixt his yea and nay. No more— Adieu, my soul's last joy! and let the world Judge if for thee I shall not be a soldier. Farewell, to-night. Eud. Is it, my lord, to say, My purpos'd sacrifice is cold parade? Perhaps I've been too willing in thy words To find its overthrow: but still it stands Against to-morrow. Montm. By my soul, I fear This very much, though it seem but of peace: And this small cloud may be the whirlwind's cradle. One day—and we are on the Asian lands, And thou art here, left in the veriest surf Of danger,—and what danger? More than death. O God, constrain this lady,—that again I may not speak my pride—else must I swear, Bound as I am by more than oath, to-morrow Shall not be mock'd. Were I to stay an age, And that day come not, such must be my oath. Eud. Leave me, my lord, to pause.—I'll not be proud. I know thy words, and for their earnestness This night shall boldly search a mother's heart; And know how I dwell there. I owe thee this, And keenly shall I look,—if but one risk Of a dishonour, that shall make me fear To meet thy face,—I'll say, without a blush, When the sun shines to-morrow, take me hence.— Yet thy soul judge me, shall I not be just?— And, if her sickness be a parent's sorrow, And I the cause, will you not leave me just? Montm. O much, yet not enough.—But that I know The issue of thy judgment, I would stand Till dawn, and be perplex'd,—else make thee yield By dreadful violence. Eud. My soul disdains To fear that all thy hope may come from thought Of maiden's weakness. Farewell, till to-morrow. Montm. Thou know'st my answer, and 'tis short adieu! Exit Montmorency. Eud. My soul, there's no alternative of good. Is it the best that I must learn she hates Her daughter's life,—and that our love, at first Not much against her wish, hath grown at last To be thus hated, as in evil minds Slight opposition grows? Zillah, to-day Saw you our mother?—Did she seem unwell? Zill. Not when I saw her in her chamber walking,— Somewhat too pale, perhaps. I saw no more. Eud. Heaven dictate to my soul. Exeunt Eudocia and Zillah. SCENE IV. —Near the French Camp. Montferrat and Montmorency meeting. Montf. I wish you joy. Montm. Of what? Montf. Of what! thy love. Aha! you lovers, when all things go smoothly, Are shy as roes: were you not with your love? Montm. Thy love, you mean? Montf. Spare me, thou lucky soldier. Faith I'm too old now:—yet there's luck in't too.— I always miss. Montm. 'Tis rather wond'rous, since you take such means T'insure success. Montf. Ay, there you quiz me rightly. I us'd no means.—I am a fool.—No means At all, my Lord, else (veil your face, young soldier,) I had been Emperor. It plagues a man, when, unexpectedly, Success goes by so nearly, he must think For one more effort, “O it had been mine.” Well, Baldwin, thou hast beat me, And I can nought but hence to Palestine To be a soldier still. Plague on these fools, Perhaps they thought because I am a fighter I cannot be a prince;—well, well, 'tis past. Montm. My lord, it grieves me, since I owe thee much— Montf. Come, come, no more on't: that too is to weigh, Methinks, too merchant-like. Montm. A word, my lord, You've done me service, and I thank thee now— Montf. And pay thee off? for, by yon cloud, what else? Aha! Sir knight, but I must laugh at weddings.— Montm. Your pardon; 'twas a blunder—for the man That serves me most, shall answer me the first For slightest wrong: but I could hardly name Thy meanness, lord of France—I pity thee. Montf. Aha, yon sun! I'll bid God help thee, sun, When thou hast slid behind a summer cloud! Good youth, bestow thine alms, and let me go.— I'll shred thee, Sir, unless you speak in haste— Meanness? Montm. 'Tis more that you don't jump, Montferrat, To catch my meaning, when I look you thus. Montf. Look Sir, I'm patient: I have done thee wrong: Walk'd in my sleep, and done a madman's tricks— Smash'd thy love's windows—pour'd into thy ear A cup of water, to sea-beat thy sleep— Put ginger in thy heart, to make thee mad;— For mad thou art, and ripe for a sword-quarrel. Young soldier, by each thing that we have talk'd of, Since first I knew thee, not one moment more Shall this lurk in thy thought:—write on that dust:— Thou shalt not name it. Montm. Call it what you will, I envy him not that does not loathe the trick.— To say the maid was thine,—meanest of lies To serve a purpose. You can't be my friend. Montf. Mean lie, indeed! Go, learn the whole from Philip. Montm. I'll learn of thee:—the lie was in thy cause:— 'Twas pass'd among the electors in thy cause. And thou art bound in honour to pull down Such mean attempts. I'll learn of thee, my lord. Men may not credit when inform'd 'twas done Without collusion, then the shame most mine, When it is thought that I have lent her name For lies to prostitute. Explain, my Lord. Montf. I'm not in the vein just now. Montm. I shall not hence till— Montf. Knight, you have presum'd To deem me pliable to such a trick,— I will not therefore. Montm. Art thou my Lord Montferrat? Montf. Ay, one that swerves not. Philip shall speak for me— Philip's thy man. Montm. My Lord, you know it all? Montf. I do. Montm. Then is the lie thine own. Montf. Well said, my Lord! it cuts the matter short. I sought thy friendship, but the fault is thine Not to have known me sooner; for this fault You owe a sight o' your sword. By Heaven I'll punish. Take care o' thy youthful life.— (They fight.) Enter a Soldier. Sol. Swords out, by St Louis, and our chiefs at work! I must not lose my general. Ho! a quarrel. Montm. My Lord Montferrat, what do we mean by this? Montf. Nothing. I'll tell thee when we meet again. [Exeunt. SCENE V. —A Square in Constantinople. Philip alone. 'Tis very strange that all men face me out, That all my knowledge fails to enforce awe. Speak for me, earthquakes, gape eternally! And let no sun from this day rise to bathe With light your ghastly lips!—Here end my hopes. Montferrat has reproach'd me;—fail'd besides. Baldwin abus'd me when I sought a place Beneath his royalty, 'cause of my whispering. How brutish not to know that my poor plan To aid Montferrat was as gross as night! But thus I overleap all Philip's schemes, Chasing these vain propensities:—Events Pass o'er me as a shadow, nor behind Leave lesson or remembrance. I must thank My own bright star if this vindictive Flanders Send not a whipping after his reproach. And then my enemy;—and he too must Assert his pride! O fool! for I have been Deceiv'd with bubbles growing on my tree, A crop of empty beauty.—Whilst I climb'd, That man has come, and shaken in my eyes The beauteous vapour, and pass'd laughing on. But I'll overtake him! Here I stand this night, My face toward where I think wild Thracia lies: I'll be a wanderer in her mountains soon, Where leagues are swallow'd up; travelling with ravens That hang their hoarse wings on the icy winds, O'er the snow-glist'ring hills at eve, until I find his grave beneath the oak-tree roots. But, by the dark grave and Antonio there;— And by my pale face, and my barefoot hopes,— How shall I strike him! and this very night Shake his full cups.—Up in these darksome skies Rattle loud winds.—In half an hour the tempest Will yell through the shudd'ring heavens.—These elements! Could I a moment wield, or catch three sparks Of Heaven's strong lightning, I would give a job To the epitaph-writer ere this night pass'd by.— I'll go this minute—down his throat, perforce, Cram poisons thick:—and let Death wipe his beard. It shall go barely, if this Baldwin too Share not my night cakes. O could I stir them up, And make their faces ominous to each other! Sit closely, Night, beneath thy dark witch-hood, That I may meditate, and do my work.— I know not where to begin;—It must be desp'rate. Enter Pedro. Ped. It grows most awfully dark, I know not well How I may find our Philip out to night. I'm told he trudges with this Flanders now. Phil. (Coming forward.) 'Tis false as Pedro who forgot his promise, To feed me with revenge. Ped. That tongue has sav'd me Uncertain searching. What if I reward The past and present? Phil. 'Tis scarcely within The outer-doors of possibility. Ped. Murtzoufle shall, ere long, be Emp'ror here, And I his second: in unearthly things, My countryman the first. Phil. Is that revenge? Ped. They come together. Phil. Is there sure revenge? Ped. As thou'rt Antonio's brother. Phil. Say'st thou so? Ped. I said revenge; for I will grant thee now, The power I spoke of is but seen afar. But thy revenge is in thy power to-night: To spur thee on;—'tis means to gain the other. Phil. Dost strike at Montmorency? Ped. At his roots. Phil. Shall he fall quickly? Ped. Ay, I think most quickly. But we must hence—follow and hear it all. Phil. Think!—only think?—and must I only hear?— Ped. Unglove thy hands then, if you wish a job:— Pause not one moment:—hence, we need thy aid. Phil. Whither, thou fiend? Ped. This place is dangerous. Phil. Shall I follow? Ped. On—come my bird!—I have thee now—revenge! Phil. Is it good scheme, sweet Pedro? Ped. Stay a moment, And I shall send Antonio's ghost to whip thee! Phil. Strew firebrands behind thee, I shall track Thy steps. I'll put o'er thee a lucky star, Good youth, until you die, if 'tis well plann'd. Ped. Come on, 'tis passing well,— I think 'twill do:—'tis well, then, boy—most well. Phil. I'm after thee—my heart beats thick and full, Like the first pulse of immortality. [Exeunt. SCENE VI. —A Room in Euphrosyne's Palace. Euphrosyne in a night-dress. Euph. Shall my purpose be Like flower, whose fragrance is its epitaph?— The thing is natural too as mother's wish;— To bring him to his royalty again, And make her queen.—More strange that thou, Murtzoufle, Would'st have this silly maid!—I reap revenge, Not from the red stalks of the comet's beard. No wizard's charm, nor aught 'yond Nature's power Have I invok'd. Sit still, thou Lord of France, A woman only works, and the weak brain Of a sick woman:—and thou, princely Baldwin, Highly hast writ thy power—a blister mock. The comment's here, a thousand burning words (laying her hand on her head.) Eclipsing hell.—Be dear, even loath'd Murtzoufle, My sacred fiend, and hurl him from his throne! Enter an Old Domestic. Dom. Madam, he waits thee now. Euph. Has no one seen him? Dom. I did not know him—till he whisper'd me. Euph. Admit him quickly. [Exit Domestic. Enter Pedro disguised. Have you thought, good Pedro? Ped. O madam, this dull brain— Euph. Hence then some hours; We need thee not until the second watch. Ped. I have it then—another power's at work You dream not of, madam; it now goes on. Euph. Nay, I had thought of it. Ped. Thy pardon, lady, 'Tis from the devil's anvil, that is chance. Euph. This head is feverish, and my thoughts to-night Wild but intense: Yet I may judge a little. Hush! there's a foot-fall. No:—but follow me Into a chamber that hears all dread things, There foot ne'er comes; and nought is heard save sound Of mouse that scratches on the boards by night. [Exeunt. SCENE VII. —Montmorency's Tent. Montmorency and Philip meeting. Montm. Ha! Philip? must I thank thee for this visit? Phil. No—no—to-day you know I did thee wrong. Montm. What is thy wish? Phil. To rid thee of a foe. My Lord, I hate thee: ask me not the cause Lest now I strike thee, and provoke my death. Montm. Were all my foes so candid and so weak, I'd fear them little. Phil. Is not our Emp'ror candid?— There's one that knows him, though he has put on The soldier's air. Montm. If thou hast aught to ask;— At once:—I stand not here to praise thy boldness, By Heaven, Montferrat has not used me well, To take thy services: and now I hear The Emp'ror is thy patron:—can I serve thee? Phil. Am I a slave, my Lord of France, a slave? One bound with bonds?—O surely not, my Lord. And shall I follow Baldwin?—No, I hate him Even as he hates thee. To-morrow sails the Doge, and I would with him. Montm. And thou shalt be physician to his highness, If such thy wish. Phil. I came to speak of this. Montm. Stay, what shall serve? Phil. Give me thy ring, 'tis done;— If not too late: I must not wait thy letter. You got it from the Doge, and he shall know it. Montm. There, and make haste. Phil. I'll send it back, my Lord. Montm. No—no—'tis thine. Phil. I see thee hence no more:—There take it back,— I cannot use it. Montm. Ere you go, one word— Should we two meet again, parade not thus Thy hatred on thy life. Phil. Thanks for thy ring— Thy counsel's a dead letter. Montm. Failing success, and if thy mind incline, Forget the past, and march with me to-morrow. Phil. Ay, to death. Montm. What mean you, Sir?—Is there aught more? Phil. No more—O! nothing more. I have it all within this little ring. [Exit Philip. Montm. Why then, farewell.— Phil. (Returning.) —My Lord, I thank thee. [Exit. SCENE VIII. —A Room in Euphrosyne's Palace. Eudocia and Zillah. Zill. I stood by her chamber door, but all was still. The night's far spent: Since morn I have not seen her; Is this a calm outspread before the storm? Eud. O God, look kindly down, for she's in trouble. She gave strict orders that I enter not: She spurns my presence:—breathes not where I breathe, And bids me hence if I would save her life. Strange inconsistency of pain or hatred! There take thy harp, and while an hour away With a soft air, for I shall watch to-night. Zill. O how fatigued I am in these sad nights! Eud. I'll sit myself: thy thoughts are not intense As mine are; thou must sleep. Zill. Wake me if aught Alarm thee in the night. O for the land Where nought I fear'd,—my own wild native land! Christians plot more than Arabs. Enter Marsas. Mar. Lady, come; Thy Montmorency calls: his messenger Is fretting at the door. Zill. O, send him in, Is it his page, good Marsas? bring him in. [Exit Marsas. Enter Philip and Attendants. Phil. I wish thee joy for France, most honour'd lady! Let me conduct thee to thy lord in haste. Eud. What Lord? What mean thy words? Where's Montmorency? Phil. He meets thee half way, in the Patriarch's barge. Eud. Wherefore, good Philip? and why not come himself? Phil. I see you know not.— Baldwin and he have quarrell'd—And this hour Comes Murtzoufle, amain, with savage host. Who shall not fear him? Ever seen in fight, And shunn'd—a black tower that afar doth fling Its shadow on the battle. Multitudes,— Men in the market-place—O multitudes!— And he shall drive his chariot o'er their necks, And make big heads not with their wat'ry eyes. Baldwin hath fear'd that Montmorency means To aid this foe,—and will not let him pass His gates, with retinue of troops to take Thee his proud bride. Rather than skulking come, Hath Montmorency sent this ring, my voucher, That he will meet thee 'neath the city walls, Upon the north, with all his mighty friends. He gave me words to speak into thy ear, A thousand times repeated; and they were— “Dishonour past the grave. O dreadful thought! “Thy mother and Murtzoufle—and their friends “Not few within the city:”—From this hour They look upon thee with their evil eyes, Scanning their victim;—thou must fix his empire. And Baldwin shall be ousted from his seat. O, I have stood too long! haste lady, come. 1st Attend. Fear us not, madam— Phil. Peace! villain. All of you away!—the boat!— [Exit Attendant. Have all things ready. Fly, thou silver bird! A thousand barges on the Golden Horn, Burning the waters with the nuptial torches, Fill'd with good men—the bravest beards in war, Await thy coming. Night's foul rains have pass'd, And lights are up in Heaven's eternal halls To shine upon thy love.—Will she not come? Eud. O God!—but I'll be bold—come, thou dark Arab; We must be soldiers. Phil. I was order'd too To bring thy eunuch: is not his name Marsas? Eud. Why stand'st thou, Zillah? Is he not like Antonio, our sweet poet? Phil. Quickly, or not at all—O not at all. Eud. We but retire a moment, to put up Our little fortune—stay for us at the gate, And speak not on thy life, for dangerous ears Are in this palace—follow me softly, Zillah. (Exeunt Eudocia and Zillah. Phil. I shall be damn'd for this—she lov'd Antonio.— And these base lies—I that have lov'd all truth. (Exit Philip. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. —Before Euphrosyne's Palace. Enter French Lords and Attendants. 1st Lord. This is a spacious mansion, but retir'd, Heavy and dull, as if no liquid wind Of the blue airy Summer ever danc'd Loosely within its halls: it is a place, Where straggling airs behind the tapestries crawl, And figures stalk along the highway lobbies. 2d Lord. Pause—rather say that in three minutes' space We'll see a glorious vision issue forth From this dull shrine. 3d Lord. But pray what share have we? For look—these windows—are they hung with flowers? Or have we caught one glance of hurrying face, Of thing—of beauty—of sixteen—of eye That comes to peep again? 2d Lord. For they have seen Young Luneville once, and they must see again— Here comes my lord. 3d Lord. Now for an aching eye! Enter Montmorency. Montm. Why stand ye here at pause? what see my lords? 3d Lord. No carrion shape, nor sight of ugly death, As my lord seems to see. Montm. Would I had seen her Sliding from off the marble seat of life, Hands eagerly clutching the slipp'ry polish, Shuddering and shrinking o'er death's misty jaws, Rather than this. 1st Lord. What means my lord?—than what? Montm. Ye men of France, ye lose your time; go home.— Why stand ye here? Away! we need you not. Would ye a tale? Then have I seen grim death Within these minutes seizing a proud woman. I pass'd the dead-room on and on, through all, And found her not.—Now let each write conjectures,— “It may thus and thus;”—But no, 'tis thus;— She now is whirling in some dreadful plot, Gone over night: and I may sit me down Upon the bank until the pool refund; Then bless my stars for a wreck:—where is my bride? Are ye not satisfied? 1st Lord. Too much, my Lord. 3d Lord. If we can't win her back. Montm. Why stand you then? It is a pause, this pause—unnatural As death itself. Some take the way o' the sea. Leave me alone: Or if you will—then swear Not to desist though you should grope through cold And barren darkness of the polar hills. Where art thou, girl?— [Exit Montm. French Lords and Attendants follow.) SCENE II. —Interior of the Church of St Sophia. Baldwin, Doge, Flemish and Venetian Lords. Bald. He seems resolved to put thy love to test. Doge. He shall be here anon; then must I blame These glimmering eyes that show me not the bride Of one I love. Enter Montferrat. Montf. Is Montmorency come? Bald. We are not far from thinking he presumes Too much upon our care. Montf. Has no one seen him? All is not well then; all's not right, I fear: For as I came I saw some of our Lords Hurry along: I heard some cry a boat:— And they look'd anxiously—they never mark'd me. Let us wait but a moment, we shall hear— Here comes himself. Enter Montmorency, his head bare. Bald. Where is thy bride? Montm. No more of that—'tis dead.— (waving his hand.) Bald. My lord, you know we wait. Montm. But wait no longer; For she hath gone upon some summer jaunt. Ha! thou old prince? I've lost my virgin bride. Pardon, my Lords of Venice and of Flanders, Are ye not all met for me? Forget the cause. Where is Mont— Montf. Say Montferrat; he is here, Glad could he have thine ear. Montm. All plagues have come on me at once:—adieu High Doge, and all.—What shall I say to thee, My friend Montferrat? (Exit Montm. Doge. Our first war is over: Things have gone well—but bitter still with sweet. All friends must part— Montf. But he and I shall never. (Exit Montf. Doge. And each man take his way: even when success Points honour on the soldier's worn-out cloak, He treads more heavily than when he went To face great dangers. Let me now retire,— I'm griev'd for Montmorency. Farewell all. Bald. Adieu, brave prince, and all. Ven. Lords. Farewell! Flem. Lords. Farewell! [Exeunt Doge and Venetian Lords. Bald. And now my countrymen, our own affairs— Enter Prince Henry. Too soon for much success. P. Henry. What if I say Murtzoufle and his power are at thy feet? Bald. Where is his person? P. Henry. Hold, you have not doubted Whether 'tis really so, nor wonder'd much At my success: but it is so indeed. And he is captive in the dungeon vault Where lay his victims late. Some troop he rais'd In the open country; then to old Alexis, Who during the siege had claim'd imperial power, Went with his services: and he was hail'd. The rest is short, as truce of wicked men, Whose oaths are prologues to their deeper plots. Whether Alexis hated him as one More wicked than himself, or put no faith, From sympathy, in all his promises;— Or whether, though himself without one hope Of royalty again, he deem'd it treason, And would not have another styl'd as he;— To-day he seiz'd Murtzoufle, gave him up. And now he's in thy power, Bald. And shall to death this night for awful crimes,— This very night when good men go to sleep. There's one called Pedro,— P. Henry. Noted as one that knew All men's affairs? His power, no man knew how, Could sway events of utmost magnitude, Himself though mean. He is securely lodged. Philip is with them. Bald. He that we dismiss'd? He must have gone to bid them welcome home, To gain their patronage. Were there no more? P. Henry. Two females likewise, deeply veil'd from sight, Besides a little eunuch. They implor'd Not to be brought into Constantinople. Yielding to their intreaties, I caus'd put them Ashore on the north side of the Golden Horn. Bald. Follow, my lords; our palace-hall shall hear Our own affairs. [Exeunt. SCENE III. —A Street in Constantinople. Montferrat and Montmorency's Page meeting. Montf. Nothing yet heard? Page. Nothing but vague reports, Numerous, but shadowy as bats in twilight. Nothing distinct. Montmorency is seen passing in haste. Montf. (advancing.) Is't possible, my lord, That thus you pass me as a thing obscure, Or cheap, or loath'd? Montm. Hark ye, my lord not now.— I have a patient at the point of death. Montf. But thou must pause a moment. Montm. Wilt thou be My patient too, and at the point of death? If, Montferrat,— If ye have work of vengeance, set me on: I'll do it thoroughly, for I am fierce. Back then, my lord,—I would not strike thee now, For I have done thee wrong.—To-night—to-night— This hour's my own—I'll meet thee at thy tent; If thou wilt do thyself so much injustice As meet a desperate man; although thy arm Is stronger far than mine. I am too late If I can't speak to her before she die: Then you have staid me, and it is our quarrel, (Our foolish heat of yesterday forgotten).— I'll shake her bones into a glow of life, But she shall speak. (Exit Montm. Montf. And have not I forgotten, As well as thou, poor youth? Ah Montmorency! For I shall lose thee. God forbid until We meet and speak! thy vengeance is my own. Did he not talk of death? Page. He did, my lord. Montf. That he must see her ere she died? Page. He said so. Ah! then I fear, my lord is— Montf. What? boy.— [Exit Montf. and Page. SCENE IV. —A Chamber in Euphrosyne's Palace. Euphrosyne lying sick on a couch, a light before her bed. Montmorency standing. Euph. Fiend, wilt you plague me still, and rudely shake My latest sands?—O that, that comes by night, Is nought to thee: See how that taper streams Away from thee. O leave me—leave me—leave me. Mont. Woman, I cling, though thou shouldst drag me down Half way the brimstone road; for well you know— Madam, you know,—Madam, I'll swear you know. Euph. Well then I know, and you shall know apace. The secret shall outburst, and it shall be A dreadful warning to rebellious children,— O'er grown with woes,—strange in a lover's eyes.— Montm. Dread prophetess, I must go back a little— Pause in thy speech; I'll overtake thee soon. Coolly—now coolly—lady, you say you know? I mark it down, it is thy own confession: And I shall find an argument to win— To draw,—to drag the secret from that bosom; Ere the mole of life, that seems to toil beneath, Leave his dark chambers.— You know,—I bless thee there,—'tis one point gained.— Softly a moment,—I shall ask thee what. Speak now, O speak. Euph. She never shall be thine. Montm. That wounds me, as it passes, With a fierce stab: But not for me, dread woman,— Not me—this one before thy dying couch: But for her sake,—thy daughter's—woman!—thine; If thou art human, not a fiend that mocks In that pale form, my thought that the last life Durst not conceal such secret, nor depart 'Neath such a burden;—speak and tell me where— Where is thy daughter? where's the innocent maid? O! where's my love? Euph. No, no. Montm. I'll blot the last, And swear she is not mine, and ne'er shall be; If thou wilt tell me, and permit this hand To pluck her out from pit of awful shame,— From death, or something worse,—I know not what:— I'll walk three times across the room, and then (For I oppress thee,) thou hast gather'd strength To tell me all. May God inspire thy heart! (He walks several times along the chamber.) (Pausing.) Now, now.— Euph. I have enough of strength, my Lord, To wish and let thee hear it. O! did none Know the dread secret but this breast of mine. A moment's view to make thy heart-strings crack;— 'Tis gone! and thou art slung down in the dark.— Ha! writ in dust, even like thy fame, proud lord, On the bald top of a high windy rock! Here—take, my lord, and knot that ribbon'd flame; Then hast thou loos'd the knot of this dread secret. Montm. Woman, I'll kneel me down, And swear thou hast afflicted me 'yond measure, And wrung this heart, till it is dry despair,— If it would make thy soul laugh; but thy tongue Must give me words.— Euph. If I provide for her a royal spouse,— If I have sent her to an emperor, What is't to thee or any lord in France? My lord, you have my house. O! very good! My couch;—I cannot rest.—This is my taper: Day-light is shut from me, 'cause I'm sick.— 'Tis pity thou shouldst share this humble light— Go hail the sun, and say, thou art his brother. Haply thou'rt my physician:—I can't guess, Else why thou are here. Physician, feel my pulse!— Montm. I tell thee thou art sick of more than death, Even of a secret that entails damnation On the poor soul. Euph. O! Heaven. I ask one moment, A giant's strength to—O! O! put him down.— Montm. Do not I see the death-star in thine eye, Which the last fever burnisheth so well? Woman, ere thy soul Go down th' eternal buckets, what did you mean,— What meant you by that hint? If thou wouldst be A dweller in that place, where sound of leaves Shall never come in lapse of fiery years, Nor murmuration of a little stream; Make oath to these dark words— Euph. Thank thee, my lord;— How dear thou art!—for thou hast given me heat.— Thank thee—O thank thee—but a little more,— And thou—shalt save—thy shame—to triumph here, O'er a sick chamber.—I shall rise anon And dance with thee.—Ho Death! where are my servants For I would rest!—There's something in my chamber, And ye wont put it out—I hear a breathing— Montm. O God, look here in pity—I must leave her. What a dread struggle in that dying face! The features bearing each its ghastly load, Seem come unto one mount!— Euph. Forbear, O mortal, For thou shalt come to this, and worse, ere long.— Thou shalt not triumph o'er me thus—out, out— (She puts out the light.) I am not ghastly now,—find thy way out.— Hark ye, my lord,—one word,— Go stab Earl Baldwin, then come back again; I swear by thy true love's virginity, To tell thee all, and thou shalt have aveng'd Partly thy loss. Some know that Baldwin well— Montm. My vengeance shall be sacred, and from thee Shall take no stain of hell. I leave thee woman Unto thyself. [Exit Montm. (She is heard laughing wildly.) SCENE V. Montmorency's Tent. (Montmorency walking slowly up and down; his page standing in the tent door and looking out.) Page. The green hair'd light that lin'd the fresh broad leaves, And fill'd the wild bird's eye, is long since gone.— Montm. 'Tis night then; what, boy, see'st thou in the night? Page. I hear no foot, my lord, but it shall come— With happy tidings. Montm. Ay 'twill come. Page. I see a night too blessed for ill tidings. Montm. Thou art too young, else I could tell thee boy.— List at the tent door,—I shall walk a little. Page. O 'tis a glorious night: a clew of winds Has been unfurl'd from off the far Olympus. Hither they come huddling the cloudy skies, Ruffling them down on Asia's level lands: The woods are shaken—a blue mingled mass Of light and shade, and tall and pillar'd trees. 'Tis dark, now light again— Montm. Canst thou not liken these uncertain skies To soldier's fortunes? Page. No, my Lord, I cannot. Montm. It might be done perhaps—keep to thy watch. Page. For no;—the soldier's life, Though brief, is bold and clear as the blue river, That hastes away. When shall we o'er these lands, My lord, to Palestine? Montm. Art thou too in the chase? ay, thou woulds't have— Would'st thou, boy?—immortality?—well! on; Fame for the noble!—to the worldly soul, Vain as dim chase when hunter hears in dreams Faint hallo o'er the hills. Page. Fame like thine own, And I would die to-morrow,—hark! a foot!— Enter Montferrat. Montf. O! I can hold no longer. I'm thy friend And shall be spite of thee. I wrong'd thee much. Philip hath reach'd us all; 'twas he that said it. And much I fear his hand is now against thee. Montm. I know—I know it: Give me thy hand, Montferrat. 'Twas I that wrong'd a man of purest metal:— I hold thee in my heart a noble man. Myself I wrong'd too;—I have felt my loss Even for a day to be estrang'd from thee. Montf. My lord, d'ye say it? I could strike myself, Not having sought thee sooner. O! even now What can I do? 'Twas mine to bring good news To lay upon the altar of our peace.— Indeed I cannot. Montm. Ha! speak out. Montf. Not so—all may be well,—I only know not. Montm. Montferrat, look,—it must be so, my friend, Evil and worse!—I'm glad I have thy friendship; And I would die for't. But—but, canst thou guess What I would say? Montf. No—no; say nought, my friend. Montm. Well then, thy hand again, and here we'll stay Till we hear something; for I dare not stir Lest I go far, and be a moment late. This day to me is lost:—pray what's astir? O pardon me—the throne—must I console? Montf. Ay, or no. I care not much: 'tis sure to Baldwin now, Murtzoufle's ta'en, and shall be judg'd to-night. Montm. And sent to death if I know Baldwin rightly. Not that he not deserves it, but that Flanders Will make all sure. My Lord, I have a thought— A fear—a hint.—Do you know Baldwin? Montf. Speak; And take for granted that I know he hates thee. Montm. I'll visit him this moment;—when suspicion Breathes, it shall be a tempest in my ear. Montf. Stay—stay my Lord;—I did not wish to speak Of one successful where I fail'd, my rival, Since I have much against him:—But in this I will be bold to say he has no share: He durst not go so far: In all his deeds Virtue is never shock'd;—men count them fair, All but who know him; such are never pleas'd; They know not why, perhaps: Spirit is wanting, Methinks, enthusiasm, that gives life To virtuous deeds. Montm. Once I advised him on a delicate point, And from that hour he lik'd me not I think; Even though my counsel squar'd with his own mind. His coldness chang'd to hatred when he knew I woo'd the maid—that was Eudocia once— O God! Sir, here I stand and have not heard— Would she were dead!—What, should a face come in This moment—stand before us and proclaim— Montferrat, Montferrat, I have a dreadful fear.— Where is thine ear? By Heaven, that face is thine.— Thou knowst it all, and wilt not tell thy friend. Why art thou pale? Montf. To see thy youth so mov'd. I shall be back with news of weal or woe, Or see thee never hence. [Exit Montf. Montm. I must go meet them: Have they found her out? Follow me, boy; and run at every footfall. [Exit Montm. and Page. SCENE VI. —A Prison Cell. Pedro walking the length of his chains—Philip following him closely—Murtzoufle's chains are heard in an adjoining cell. Ped. Keep thy own circle. Why thus dog me? Phil. Oh! I'll clutch thy life: why hast thou brought me hither? Ped. Are not my chains as heavy as thine own? I brought thee not. Phil. Dread powers! if I must die!— Thou art my countryman, hast shar'd my heart,— Something like love since—mindest thou the day,— When I, with young Antonio in my hand, 'Scap'd from the earthquake's jaws, and found thee striving To keep thy feet and make thy way through fields, Thy back upon the fated town? Misfortune Made us three brothers, though I lik'd not much Thy cruel smile,—the levity,—the scorn That grinn'd back on a city doom'd to ruin. Who led us from our country? Pedro—Who Brought us to Greece? thou, Pedro:—and the rest Lies at thy door. Nay, frown not, I shall cling When we are ghosts, and flit, shudd'ring, like leaves,— When we are blown in shoals along the shore Of everlastingness, I'll hunt thy shade. Ped. What care I for this jargon? Art thou not He that long dogg'd the steps of Montmorency? Went where he went? still gazing on his face With eager look that seem'd to ask an alms, He that durst never strike? I scorn this Philip, Upon whose face the spirit of life is faint As the last farewell on a maid's wan lips, When the word dies a dewy bubble, soundless. Phil. Where is thy wit? thou canst not put me down A thought or two? Ped. Nay, have it as thou wilt. Ask Pedro nothing, he can tell thee nothing, Nor cast up chances save 'twixt hour and hour Which one shall have us.—We must shake our feet At all the world to-night; or— Phil. (throwing himself on the floor.) O! they dare not take my soul! Mercy! O mercy men! nor cast me forth To nothingness and dust; nor coffin up This life in dark oblivion. (Rising). Pedro! Pedro! Thou canst not know! would that the hour were come— Or never came! Let's wink and rush on death.— What is the hour? Ped. No diary is here Save thy pale face;—it goes to strike despair:— No line of manliness is on that face. Must I not die too? Here shall Pedro sit Till then, and wish not, far less try to hope. No man can make me wish, and I shall never Deck with my hopes a sacrifice. Hallo! We're ready all: there's for me sympathy,— These echoing walls. Now turn the bolts,—I long To laugh on their beards, and show them a neat trick. Phil. And what's thy life or death that canst not see Beyond the pang or prospect of the moment? But I can see th' alarms of utmost nature.— Would the sun might exhale me, and I grow A portion of his fire, so might I run O'er all the earth! Ped. When shalt thou need my money? Is thy wine out? thy means of riot spent? Phil. But think not these were pleasures that I lov'd: I sought them to o'erwhelm my wearied sense When my deep search seem'd vain, and study vain. Perhaps all's vain—perhaps 'tis best to die. Where is thy promise? give me wealth to search; I'll set a wheel in motion that shall fling, In its rapidity, all sensual things Far to the winds—dread word! and must I die! (A sound is heard of turning bolts.) Ped. My hour is come at last—thy hour is come, Thou little imp of death! come do for Pedro, (taking a vial from his bosom.) More than the black-wing'd tempest could achieve When Heaven's dark bottles burst, and our frail ship, Driven on the whirlpool's wheel, was sent below And ground upon the millstones of the sea. (As he is drinking it, Philip springs forward, snatches it out of his hand, and drinks the remainder. Then leans against the wall.) Ped. Thou hast o'erreach'd me, greedy cormorant! 'Twill screw thy beak—perhaps I have enough.— Enter Montferrat. Ped. I know thine errand—What if I mock thine errand, And bid thee hence and learn? Montf. Where is Murtzoufle? Ped. Within, but fallen: no man should here insult him Were I unchain'd. Montf. Thou to my purpose, then,— O! I dare scarcely put the dreadful question. Ped. Be brief, good signor, No trifling, with your leave: I wish this hour To be the present: Heedless of the future, I have no wish to turn upon the past. To save thy epithets, I've done no good In all my life. And I were damn'd, Montferrat, To think that I deserve pity of man.— I ask no favour after my confession. Montf. I praise—but no— Shall such as thou o'ercrow the great and good? Answer me, villain. Ped. Pass to thy second question. If she's not in the tower of Bohemond, A nunnery now.—O! I could name you men Whose hearts are nunneries too—wilt not be done? It serves me not:—I scorn such—time is short— Quickly and ask me if her state be chang'd, And let me tell thee— Montf. O damn'd fiend, forbear. Ped. Ha! thou art satisfied? Montf. Not till I strike thee, And him that clanks his badges in that cell.— Look, I put up my blade:—may all my foes Have their swords tainted with such blood as thine. I must then be confounded. Villain, proceed— Ped. Aha! my hour is past;—I'll say no more. Montf. I dare not wish to learn, lest I be first— (Exit Montf.) Ped. Let him go, Philip.—Pray how art thou? nodding Unto the weary land? hast thou not seen them Sitting on milestones of the downward road,— Nodding in antic rage as we come on,— To chase us everlastingly? Ho! Philip, Pause where the road divides till I o'ertake thee, And we shall choose our path.—O soul of man, What art thou now? I feel the fiery nettles Touching my reins! Phil. O can my voice reach earth— (falling.) Ped. What wouldst thou boy? Phil. O chase these cormorants:— Nothing but help—they gnaw my very entrails With beaks of fire! Ped. Philip, is't true at last? Phil. O ay, the lake of fire,—and there they sat In a long file upon the fire-burnt coast, Shiv'ring their drowsy feathers, shaking their beaks In silence, looking on the dismal flood. Not a sound till I came—then all at once, Circling and screaming from the ashes dun, Which their wings scatter'd, one by one, they rose— And here they are,—down, down and make me cinders.— I hear the grinding of the wheel of time, Faster and faster as I downward go To the eternal round; but that is nothing— O were I shut for ages in black tower With a moist roaring wind, to see from window Only far silent road where foot ne'er travell'd, Seen by reflection of an icy dawn That never rose but hung betwixt the lids Of the horizon; and to see nothing Of life or motion save low mists that crept Into the shudd'ring woods;—'twere paradise.— O fool! can thought of moist and icy things Put out thy fires? take spider's venom—toad's— Anoint my bowels.— Ped. I feel it now—go on—let's hear the worst. Phil. My mouth is filled— With fire—and dust—my tongue—Antonio, help— (Dies.) Ped. (Taking the lamp from the wall and putting it out.) Out, out, I must not see him,—give me darkness! The glowworm is within,—'tis sore indeed! Ha! ha! ha! ha! the feast is met, good friends,— There take thy seat Antonio, and there Philip— See, see that death's-head glowing on the table, Lighting the dark room, and the brethren's faces! Oh! mark Antonio's face. Ha! ha! 'tis mine— Am I alone with fire? Clear-glowing ceilings figur'd with sprawling imps Reel in my eyes— Poison, I'll conquer thee till all at once Thy power—Ho, Pedro press thy lip—now—now— (His fall is heard on the floor.) SCENE VII. Before Montmorency's tent. (Montmorency and a French knight. Soldiers in the back ground.) Fr. Knt. To-morrow? Montm. Ay, farewell to night— Good friends, to-morrow at the earliest dawn— (The soldiers shout, and retire.) Enough, pass on, and give the troops your care, See them accoutred gallantly once more— [Ex. Knight. Once more—Eudocia, ay once more; for thou Hast left me strangely, wench.—She must be dead.— I've bow'd along this day to glean the scraps Of doubt:—my harvest told at night is nought But empty doubt;—a mighty host has stood, Staid in its movement pointing at Montmorency. Longer this shall not be;—and for thee, maiden, Nothing is left if thou be yet alive,— Save to look wearily from some high rock After our hurrying host, that like a storm Goes down on other lands:—I am resolved— But I will pray that some strong circumstance This night may wrench me from my onward purpose, All for my Grecian girl:—and yet—and yet— We march to-morrow. Ye dark ancestors In your mail'd sockets mould'ring, I'll not blush When I lie down amongst you;—but no word No welcome give me,—I'm an angry ghost For my Eudocia.—There too hide the stars Rushing into their caves! Have ye too look'd And seen aught 'gainst me, if your light shine for man, On Fate's dark dial? On with the moon, your mistress, Faster, more fast, through storm of wind and cloud! Shall I not onward too?—Here comes Montferrat.— Enter Montferrat. Shall we go, see prepar'd To-morrow's march? no—no—there heed him not,— His wish is otherwise—and I were damn'd, Did I not ask of her—and my last question Prevent the word that bade us hence for ever.— Montferrat, nothing yet?— Montf. Give me thy hand,— To-morrow if you please; and let us off,— Fall in the battle,—'tis a glorious end: More proud the farther as it backward comes Up the red sky of years, from downward age.— Hurra! for Palestine and brief career!— Montm. Ay, ay, I know thy meaning, it shall be— The soldier loves the battle for itself; The patriot as the means of peace:—But I Must woo it for forgetfulness and death. I know thy meaning—that we may forget— Stand by a little—here from lane-ends of death,— If I guess rightly.— (Enter Soldier with a letter, Montm. snatches it.) Montf. There's gold, good fellow, it shall save me pain. Montm. (reading,) “It were worse than death to find me; fly far from me, for I am fallen. I shall soon be ashes. Again this prays thee to forbear and seek me no more. Forget her that was once—Eudocia.” Aha! we'll look to that—Hear'st thou, Montferrat? The where? the where, good fellow? where's the Lady? Sol. My lord, I know not. Montm. O but pause a little— She that wrote this? the lady with dark hair?— Fellow, at once—you know. Sol. No, on my soul. 'Twas found in the camp, and came no one knows whence. Montm. So, so, and this is all? where are we now? [Ex. Soldier. Montferrat, read, my eye is dazzled somewhat. Montf. Stay till she leave yon cloud. Montm. Give me, I'll read myself—Is there no star, Meanwhile,—no star of love? I'll tear thee then, Thou crabbed paper, thou hast nothing more,— Not even a scratch showing the tortured wish, Inkless but deep:—vouchsafe then maid at least To send thy ghost to explain if thou must die. But look, Montferrat, we've th' appendix now! There comes the mortal face, let's stand and mark,— How fearfully he comes! O glorious thing, This coming in from all the winds of heaven! For by my soul I'm glad to be resolved, Though hands meanwhile spread down the beds of death. I knew it must to-night—it could not be That thing lac'd up so quickly should go by So lately, and not be o'erta'en and known.— Whence comes our Marsas? (Marsas, seeing himself discovered, bursts forward and throws himself on the ground before Montmorency.) Rise, tell me of thy lady, and thy trust. Mar. Not till you pardon me. Montm. I have not heard thy story. Mar. I'll grovel here for ever. Montm. On my life— I'm not thy lord—lead me to her, and she Shall say you knew not. Mar. No—no—on my oath. And there's thy ring—O pardon me, my Lord! 'Twas Philip—and a thousand times he bade me Take care of it; and have I not? O pardon! Indeed, I went with her,—but let me swear You sent for me, if Philip has not lied. Montm. He lied, indeed! Mar. False Philip—and false Baldwin! Montm. Baldwin, at last?— Mar. Ay, on our homeward journey, When I press'd Philip— And kept his villany before his eyes;— Tell Montmorency, said he, Baldwin did it. Fearing your royal bride might give you claim, To interfere with his own present power, Baldwin thus tried to thwart you. Montm. Here's truth!—did he? Then have I work to-night, and vengeance too! Marsas, say nothing more, for I must see her. Only where is she? Mar. At Prince Bohemond's Tower. Montf. My Lord,—my friend, you must not go. Montm. O God! Wherefore? Montf. Ask nothing: let me lock thee up Until to-morrow. Montm. Tower or palace? speak, Which shall I visit first? Could I divide myself, a half for each. Ho, page! Enter Montmorency's Page. Here is my ring.—Get thee with twenty soldiers— Be near the hall where criminals are tried, And know my call.—I shall be there, anon— What hour, my Lord? you said to-night, methinks? Montf. The second watch. But let me ask— Montm. Away boy, get thee ready. [Exit Page. Montf. Pause one moment— What art thou doing? let me command—intreat— Montm. When did Montferrat grow so wise and wary? Recal my orders, I myself shall go. Montf. Well, I shall meet thee there too. Montm. I know 'tis rash, Since you have yielded. Pardon, noble Marquis, You must not say me nay,—this last request— (is going off.) (Coming back.) —Farewell, my friend! If I have shown respect To him that taught me war and victory;— It has been as you wish'd, frankly to come— Freely to speak: forgive the rest, Montferrat. (Exit Montm. Mar. He goes, when shall he come? O dreadful night! O night of woe to lovers! but more foul That other night! the stars kept in their cressets. What art thou, thus alone, that stand'st o'er Marsas? Bury him here.— Montf. Rise—rise—thou gentle spirit! And follow me if thou hast lost thy master. Enter Montmorency's Page. Page. Went my Lord hence just now? Montf. Did you not meet him? Page. Is he in wrath or sorrow? Past the camp A figure westward went: he pass'd me by At a short distance; when beyond me, turned; Retrac'd his steps; stood still and eastward look'd Unto Constantinople—and its towers Against the moon: his glittering eye stood still, Some minutes' space: his stature rose dilated: Then waving with short motion, as in scorn, Or pride, his hand, or sorrow, he was gone Away to the westward. Montf. It was Montmorency, Mind his command. I'll follow him afar. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. —A Chamber in the Nunnery at Prince Bohemond's Tower. Eudocia and Zillah seated on a couch dressed in Mournings. Zill. 'Tis night, I think. Eud. And when did day pass by? The day to me is hid in its own light. 'Tis as the ghost of night. Enter Abbess. Abb. I bless you in God's name! And grieve not for the days of earthly passion! Happy are ye above the world-worn sinners! Only the will bears stain:—hence be ye pure, Dove-hearted maidens, then even in this life Ye win some glow of angel purity, As youth may win that shuns the thoughts of sin. Then grieve not, O, for earth! the life of man Is here dim light seen through the ribs of death,— A candle in the wind:—his greatest glory, But as the changes of an April day— Pieces of broken rainbows and dark clouds.— Maid, is thy heart sick? but she hears me not. Adieu to-night.— (She is going out when Eudocia rises suddenly.) Eud. Pardon, good Lady, What would'st thou with me? Then, good-night, good-mother! If you will go so soon. Give me your blessing, Before you go, for I am sick indeed! Abb. May all saints pray to heal thee in the night. (Exit Abbess. (Eudocia sits silently down beside Zillah.) (Montmorency bursts in—The Abbess returns and stands at the door.) Montm. Here sits she—I have found thee now, Eudocia! Eud. (Shrieking.) Rash man! we want thee not—not yet—not yet. She is not found:—her heart is in the grave,— 'Twill rise to curse thee, if thou fly not hence. Montm. Art thou—O, art thou— Eud. Heaven's swift messenger, Bear thee through air far hence, and tell thee all! I am not thine. Montm. Well,—why not likewise add That we are struck with the last curse on earth? You are too niggard of your words. If—if— May the stars start from out their sockets! run Their eyes on the sharp lances of the north.— Confusion come!—this now is to be curs'd! What need men speak? Eud. But hear, my Lord— Montm. Thou dar'st not—wilt thou? can thy tongue find words, Whilst I am trembling—wishing that this pile May fall on me for ever—bear me down That I may never have a moment's space To think on such dishonour? See me kneel— (kneeling.) Come down thou pile, and bury us for ever,— Loosen the garters of thy strong knit pillars! Heaven smear my senses with thick sleepy poisons!— (Starting up.) —Thou girl, thou hast undone me! ah! why? why? Thyself too:—thou art worthy of reproach? Eud. Stab me with thy words— Then take thy sword. But pause—and show thy claim— I am Murtzoufle's. Montm. Horror beyond itself! How shall I name thee, or but think thy name, When the past comes? What art thou now to me? Must I claim but the fierce distemper'd dream Where thou shalt ever live? Where is this husband? Perhaps he claims me too—we will go meet him. Eud. Why look'st thou on me, I shall blast thine eyes. Stay'st thou to hear me groan? Ay, bide one moment, Till—Montmorency art thou mov'd in soul?— Then is imagination on her springs, And horrors flit around me whilst I'm here:— Cast up,—conceive what evil minds can think To aid them—death? What dread of death had I, That sought, but found it not? O shame and guilt, And dread of innocence unknown, and more Than I can name!—Away! what right have I To live before thine eyes?—Stab, and pass on. Montm. Men have been rash, I'll stand awhile and look Till I have seen 'tis true.—Sweet cherub come, And whisper me, this is my virgin bride! Let me approach, maiden, and I'll forgive thee. Eud. (Shrieking.) Ha! touch me not. (As she approaches, she snatches a dagger from his side and stabs herself. Zillah sits motionless.) I wish not thy forgiveness.— (she falls back on the couch.) Abb. (Coming forward.) Is not this murder, sir? Has not thy coming pluck'd a life away, From sweet paths of religion? Montm. Murder? ay, It may be murder,—for her brow is pale. Eud. You may come near.—My spirit ebbs and looks Back to our love.—Ah! Montmorency! never— Montm. Perhaps no—girl. Eud. Has not our love been sweet, A pleasant picture, though it has been set In dark accompaniments? Montm. What more, Eudocia? Eud. Forget my death— Montm. Forget! Is it that I May live and laugh in jolly camps,—forget Her that I lov'd so deeply, and at once? I'll fly this moment, for I fear thee—thou Wilt lay some dread forbearance on my sword. Here swear I to revenge thy death:—and now Wish me not perjur'd—bid me not forbear. There, there she dies! Out sword, she sees thee not.— O! I'll not stumble though an earthquake throw A thousand thresholds to her chasms before me! (He runs to the door, but returns.) What would'st thou, love? Eud. O, ay, that word once more! If my dim eyes can see—thou went'st a moment— Out of my sight? help!—this is death— (Dies.) Montm. The flutter of her eyelid's still.—I'll touch Her blood.—O God!—once more.—I shape the cross Upon my brow with it: that man who mocks The cross, fighting its battles, yet a murd'rer, Shall know his mockery.—Whose blood is this? Baldwin, whose blood is this? Look to this cross. (Montmorency runs out with his sword drawn. Zillah remains motionless. The Abbess approaches the body.) SCENE IX. —A Hall of Judgment. Baldwin seated—Greek Lords standing around—Murtzoufle in chains. Bald. Guards, lead him out. [They are leading out Murtzoufle. Enter Montmorency, with a drawn sword. Montm. (seeing Murtzoufle.) Earth, bear'st thou yet the monster? I shall rid thee. (Offers to strike Murtzoufle, who lifts high his chain'd arms, as if courting the blow.) No—chain'd? unarm'd?—I wont—I wont, Eudocia. We'll let him be a spectacle to mobs.— Now ope thy bloody lips and cry for me, Baldwin's a villain!—Quick there, find thy sword! Ay, it is well,—build round thy nest with blades But this shall reach thee.— (As he thrusts at Baldwin, the Grecian guards interpose.) Ha! all potent guards?— What if I call mine too? Ho! page, a rescue! Bald. We are beforehand there too.—Go, bring chains— This madman here— Will have all bow before his lordly wrath. Montm. What! bind me? surely not? Now by the eternal spheres but I am mock'd— This sword shall answer thee. (He makes another burst at Baldwin, but draws back desperately wounded by the guards.) Thou devil, Montferrat, where's my score of men— I owe thee this.—Villain, d'ye think I'm slain? Not yet! (He makes another attempt, and receives more wounds.) (Leaning on his sword.) Baldwin, I'll down and tell the ghosts of heroes Ye skulk and dare not meet the swords of men— O God! is this the battle where men die? (falls.) Enter Montferrat in haste. Montf. Has no one seen my friend?— Fell'd to the ground! What thing is this, my Lords? Methinks the murderer should be down too. Ho! Knights of France,—revenge! there's murder here! Now by the holy cross what should this mean? Baldwin, you hated him,—if you have dar'd To crop our triumphs thus and smite my friend, I'll cut thy knees, by Heaven, be they of brass. Now, ere his life, that darkens in Death's door, Go into the silent house; answer me— Give my soul calmness—I shall do a deed else. Enter Marsas, who, seeing Montmorency, screams, and tearing his robe, tries to cover him.—Montmorency, not yet dead, puts it by. Mar. (Looking up to Montferrat.) And who art thou that o'er this body standst Seeming to mourn this death? Here's Montmorency— Why was he slain? was he not gallant youth? (Flings himself down beside Montmorency.) Bald. (To Montf.) Dost thou presume that I must answer thee? Montf. Canst thou parade, cold-hearted—in an hour Whose every moment drops with blood and sorrow? Bald. He sought a foe: You too are on his list. Montf. (Stooping.) I'd die, my friend, could you believe me clear Of aught to move you thus. Montm. I die—before—let me be— (Dies.) Montf. Speak,—O speak. So, so: and this is all of thee, the brave! Somewhat too rash, perhaps; but great indeed, Whose honour was a brother to the sun!— Ye men of Greece, this must be heard aright. And something more, Baldwin, I have to ask. Be there who mov'd him thus by injury, I'll have at him—nay, I shall mark my sword By little inches,—that man's punishment Shall not stay at one measure from my hilt.— Take up that youth— Let him be buried as the brave should be. Bald. Lead on, my lords, we'll answer to their wishes, Not to their threats. Montf. Well then, I trust no cause Shall keep me here for vengeance 'yond this day; To-morrow I am bound for Palestine. Let the brave dead be first—now take the way To the temple of Saint John. [Exeunt Attendants bearing the body, Baldwin, Montferrat, &amp;c. behind—Marsas rises slowly and follows.</field>
