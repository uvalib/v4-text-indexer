      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. ScÃ¦na prima. Duke, Shamount, and 4 Gentlemen. Duke. Shamount, welcome; we have mist thee long, Though absent but two daies: I hope your sports Answer your time and wishes. Sham. Very nobly sir: We found game worthy your delight my Lord, It was so royall. Du. I've enough to heare on't, Prethee bestow't upon me in discourse. 1 Gen. What is this Gentleman Coz? you are a Courtier, Therefore know all their insides. 2 Gent. No farther then the Taffitie goes good Coz, For the most part, which is indeed the best part Of the most generall inside: marry thus far I can with boldnesse speake this ones mans Character, And upon honour passe it for a true one; He has that strength of manly merit in him, That it exceeds his Soveraignes power of gracing; He's faithfully true to valour, that he hates The man from CÃ¦sars time, or farther off, That ever tooke disgrace unreveng'd: And if he chance to read his abject story, He teares his memory out, and holds it vertuous, Not to let shame have so much life amongst us; There is not such a curious piece of courage Amongst mans fellowship, or one so jealous Of honours losse, or reputations glory: There's so much perfect, of his growing story. 1 Gen. 'Twould make one dote on vertue as you tell it. 2 Gen. I ha' told it to much losse, beleeve it Coz. 3 Gent. How the Duke graces him? what is he brother? 4 Gen. Do you not yet know him? a vain-glorious coxcombe, As proud as he that fell for't: Set but aside his valour, no vertue, Which is indeed, not fit for any Courtier; And we his fellowes are as good as he, Perhaps as capable of favour too, For one thing or another, if 'twere look'd into: Give me a man, were I a Soveraigne now, Has a good stroake at Tennis, and a stiffe one, Can play at Equinoctium with the Line, As even as the thirteenth of September, When day and night lye in a scale together: Or may I thrive as I deserve at Billiards; No otherwise at Chesse, or at Primero: These are the parts requir'd, why not advanc'd? Du. Trust me, it was no lesse then excellent pleasure, And I'm right glad 'twas thine. How fares our kinsman? Who can resolve us best? 1 Gent. I can my Lord. Du. There if I had a pitty without bounds, It might be all bestowedâA man so lost In the wild waies of passion, that he's sensible Of nought but what torments him? 1 Gent. True my Lord, He runs through all the Passions of mankind, And shifts 'em strangely too: one while in love, And that so violent, that for want of businesse, Hee'l court the very Prentice of a Laundresse, Though she have kib'd heeles: and in's melancholly agen, He will not brooke an Empresse, though thrice fairer Then ever Maud was; or higher spirited Then Cleopatra, or your English Countesse: Then on a sudden he's so merry againe, Out-laughs a waiting woman, before her first Child: And turning of a hand, so angryâ 'Has almost beate the Northen fellow blind; That is for that use only; if that mood hold my Lord, 'Had need of a freshman; I'le undertake, He shall bruise three a month. Du. I pitty him dearely: And let it be your charge, with his kind brother, To see his moods observ'd; let every passion Be fed ev'n to a surfet, which in time May breed a loathing: let him have enough Of every object, that his sence is rapt with; And being once glutted, then the taste of folly Will come into his rellish. Exit. 1 Gent. I shall see Your charge my Lord most faithfully effected: And how does noble Shamount? Sha. Never ill man Untill I heare of basenesse, then I sicken, I am the healthful'st man i'th' Kingdome else. 1 Gent. Be arm'd then for a fit, Enter Lapet. Here comes a fellow Will make you sicke at heart, if basenesse do't. Sha. Let me be gone: what is he? 1 Gent. Let me tell you first, It can be but a qualme, pray stay it out sir, Come, y'ave borne more then this. Sha. Borne? never any thing That was injurious. Gen. Ha, I am far from that. Sha. He lookes as like a man as I have seene one: What would you speake of him? speake well I prethee, Even for humanities cause. 1 Gent. You'd have it truth though? Sha. What else sir? I have no reason to wrong heav'n To favour nature; let her beare her owne shame If she be faultie. 1 Gent. Monstrous faultie there sir. Sha. I'm ill at ease already. 1 Gent. Pray beare up sir. Sha. I Prethee let me take him down with speed then. Like a wild object that I would not looke upon. 1 Gent. Then thus: he's one that will endure as much As can be lay'd upon him. Sha. That may be noble: I'm kept too long from his acquaintance. 1 Gent. O sir, Take heed of rash repentance, y'are too forward To find out vertue where it never setled: Take the particulars first of what he endures; Videlicet, Bastinadoes by the great. Sha. How! 1 Gent. Thumps by the dozen, and your kicks by wholesale. Sha. No more of him. 1 Gent. The twinges by the nostril he snuffes up, And holds it the best remedy for sneazing. Sha. Away. 1 Gent. Has been thrice switz't from seven a clock till nine, Yet with a Cart-Horse stomack fell to break-fast, Forgetfull of his smart. Sha. Nay, the disgrace on't; There is no smart but that: base things are felt More by their shames then hurts Sir, I know you not, But that you live an injury to nature: I'm heartily angry with you. Lap. Pray give your blow or kicke, and begon then: For I ne're saw you before, and indeed, Have nothing to say to you, for I know you not. Sha. Why wouldst thou take a blow? Lap. I would not sir, Unlesse 'twere offer'd me; and if from an enemyâ I'de be loth to deny it from a stranger. Sha. What, a blow? Endure a blow? and shall he live that gives it? Lap. Many a faire yeareâwhy not sir? Sha. Let me wonder! As full a man to see too, and as perfectâ I prethee live not longâ Lap. How? Sha. Let me intreat it: Thou dost not know what wrong thou dost mankind, To walke so long here; not to dye betimes. Let me advise thee, while thou hast to live here, Ev'n for mans honour sake, take not a blow more. Lap. You should advise them not to strike me then sir, For Ile take none I assure you, lesse then are given. Sha. How faine would I preserve mans forme from shame, And cannot get it done? however sir, I charge thee live not long. Lap. This is worse then beating. Sha. Of what profession art thou, tell me sir, Besides a Taylor? for Ile know the truth. Lap. A Taylor? I'm as a good a Gentlemanâ Can shew my armes and all. Sha. How black and blew they are? Is that your manifestation? upon paine Of pounding thee to dust, assume not wrong fully, The name of Gentleman, because I am one, That must not let thee live. Lap. I have done, I have done sir, If there be any harme, beshrew the Herald, I 'em sure I ha not been so long a gentleman, To make this anger: I have nothing no where, But what I dearely pay for. Exit. Sh. Groom begone; I never was so heart-sick yet of man. Enter Lady, the Dukes sister, Lapets wife. 1 Gen. Here comes a cordiall Sir from tother sex, Able to make a dying face look chearfull. Sh. The blessednesse of Ladiesâ Lady. Y'are well met sir. Sh. The sight of you has put an evill from me, Whose breath was able to make vertue sicken. Lady. I'me glad I came so fortunately. What was't sir? Sh. A thing that takes a blow, lives and eates after it, In very good health; you ha' not seen the like Madam, A monster worth your sixpence, lovely worth, Speak low Sir; by all likely-hoods 'tis her husband, That now bestow'd a visitation on me. Farewell sir. Ex. Sh. Husband? is't possible that he has a wife? Would any creature have him? 'twas some forc'd match, If he were not kick'd toth' Church oth' wedding day, Ile never come at Court. Can be no otherwise: Perhaps he was rich, speak Mistris Lapet, was it not so? VVife. Nay, that's without all question. Sh. O ho, he would not want kickers enow then; If you are wise, I much suspect your honesty; For wisedome never fastens constantly, But upon merit: If you incline to foole, You are alike unfit for his societie; Nay if it were not boldnesse in the man That honours you, to advise you, troth his company Should not be frequent with you. VVife. 'Tis good counsell sir. Sh. Oh I am so carefull where I reverence, So just to goodnesse, and her precious purity, I am as equallie jealous, and as fearefull, That any undeserved staine might fall Upon her sanctified whitenesse, as of the sin That comes by wilfulnesse. VVife. Sir, I love your thoughts, And honour you for your counsell and your care. Sh. We are your servants. VVife. Hee's but a gentleman oth' chamber, he might have kist me: Faith, where shall one finde lesse courtesie, then at Court? Say I have an undeserver to my husband: That's ne're the worse for him: well strange lipt men, 'Tis but a kisse lost, there'll more come agen. Exit. Enter the Passionate Lord, the Dukes Kinsman, makes a congie or two to nothing. 1 Gen. Look who comes here sir, his love fit's upon him; I know it, by that set smile, and those congies. How courteous hee's to nothing? which indeed, Is the next kin to woman; onely shadow The elder Sister of the twaine, because 'tis seen too. See how it kisses the fore-finger still; Which is the last edition, and being come So neare the thumbe every Cobler has got it. Sham. What a ridiculous peice, humanity Here makes it selfe? 1 Gent. Nay good give leave a little sir, Y'are so precise a manhoodâ Sha. It afflicts me When I behold unseemelinesse in an Image So neare the Godhead, 'tis an injurie To glorious Eternity. 1 Gent. Pray use patience sir. Pas. I do confesse it freely precious Lady, And loves suit is so, the longer it hangs The worse it is; better cut off sweet Madam; O that same drawing in your nether lip there, Foreshewes no goodnesse Lady: make you question on't? Shame on me but I love you. 1 Gent. Who is't sir, You are at all this paines for? may I know her? Pas. For thee thou fairest, yet the falsest woman, That ever broke mans heart-strings. 1 Gent. How? how's this sir? Pas. What, the old tricke of Ladies? mans apparrell, Wil't nere be left amongst you? steale from Court in't? 1 Gent. I see the fit growes stronger. Pas. Pray let's talke a little. Sha. I can endure no more. 1 Gen. Good, let us alone a little: You are so exact a worke: love light things somewhat sir. Sha. Th'are all but shames. 1 Gen. What is't you'd say to me sir? Pas. Can you be so forgetfull to enquire it Lady? 1 Gent. Yes truly sir. Pas. The more I admire your flintinesse: What cause have I given you, illustrious Madam, To play this strange part with me? 1 Gent. Cause enough, Do but looke backe sir into your memorie, Your love to other women Ã´ lewd man, 'Tas almost kil'd my heart, you see I'm chang'd with it, I ha' lost the fashion of my Sexe with griefe on't, When I have seen you courting of a Dowdie; Compar'd with me, and kissing your fore-finger To one o'th' black-guards Mistresses: would not this Cracke a poore Ladies heart, that beleev'd love, And waited for the comfort? but 'twas said sir, A Lady of my haire cannot want pittying: The Countries coming up, farewell to you sir. Pas. Whither intend you sir? 1 Gent. A long journey sir: The truth is, I'm with child, and goe to travell. Pas. With child? I never got it. 1 Gent. I heard you were busie At the same time sir, and was loath to trouble you. Pas. Why, are not you a whore then, excellent Madam? 1 Gent. O by no meanes, 'twas done sir in the state Of my beliefe in you, and that quits me, It lies upon your falshod. Pas. Does it so? You shall not carry her though sir, she's my contract. 2 Gent. I prethee thou four Elements ill brued, Torment none but thy selfe; away I say Thou beast of passion, as the drunkard is The beast of wine; dishonour to thy making, Thou man in fragments. Pas. Heare me pretious Madam. Sham. Kneele for thy wits to heaven. Pas. Lady, I'le father it, Who ere begot it: 'tis the course of greatnesse. Sha. How vertue groanes at this? Pas. I'le raise the Court, but I'le stay your slight. Sha. How wretched is that peice? Ex. Pas. Lord. 1 Gen. He's the Dukes kinsman sir. Sha. That cannot take a passion away sir, Nor cut a fit, but one poore houre shorter, He must endure as much as the poorest begger, That cannot change his money; there's the equality In our impartiall essence: What's the newes now? Ent. a Servant. Ser. Your worthy brother sir, has left his charge, And come to see you. Ent. Shamounts brother a Souldier. Sha. O the noblest welcome That ever came from man, meet thy deservings: Methinkes I've all joyes treasure in mine armes now, Soul. You are so fortunate in prevention brother, You alwaies leave the answerer barren sir, You comprehend in few words so much worthâ Sha. 'Tis all too little for thee: come th'art welcome, So I include all: take especiall knowledge pray, Of this deare Gentleman, my absolute friend, That loves a Souldier far above a Mistris, Thou excellently faithfull to 'em both. But love to manhood, ownes the purer troath. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Shamonts brother a Souldier, and a Lady the Dukes sister. Lady There should be in this galleryâoh th'are here, Pray sit downe; beleeve me sir I'm weary. Soul. It well becomes a Lady to complaine a little Of what she never feeles: your walke was short Madam, You can be but affraid of wearinesse; Which well employes the softnesse of your Sexe, As for the thing it selfe, you never came to't. La. Y'are wonderously well read in Ladies sir. Soul. Shall I thinke such a creature as you Madam, Was ever borne to feele paine, but in travell? There's your full portion, Besides a little toothache in the breeding, Which a kind husband too, takes from you Madam. La. But where do Ladies sir, find such kind husbands? Perhaps you have heard The Rhumaticke story of some loving Chandler now, Or some such melting fellow, that you talke So prodigall of mens kindnesse: I confesse sir, Many of those wives are happy, their ambition Does reach no higher, then to love and ignorance, Which makes an excellent husband, and a fond one: Now sir, your great ones aime at height, and cunning, And so are oft deceiv'd, yet they must venture it; For 'tis a Ladies contumely sir, To have a Lord an Ignorant; then the worlds voice Will deeme her for a wanton ere she taste on't: But to deceive a wise man, to whose circumspection, The world resignes it selfe with all his envy; 'Tis lesse dishonour to us then to fall, Because his beleev'd wisdome keepes out all. Sould. Would I were the man Lady, that should venture His wisedome to your goodnesse. Lad. You might faile In the returne, as many men have done sir: I dare not justifie what is to come of me, Because I know it not, though I hope vertuously; Marry what's past or present, I durst put Into a good mans hand. Which if he take Upon my word for good, it shall not couzen him. Sol. No, nor hereafter? Lad. It may hap so too sir: A womans goodnesse, when she is a wise, Lies much upon a mans desert, believe it sir, If there be fault in her, Ile pawn my life on't, 'Tis first in him, if she were ever good, That makes one; knowing not a husband yet, Or what he may be, I promise no more vertues, Then I may well performe, for that were cousenage. Sol. Happy were he that had you with all feares, That's my opinion, Lady. Enter Shamont &amp; a servant listning. Ser. What say you now sir? Dare you give confidence to your owne eyes? Sha. Not yet I dare not. Ser. No? Sha. Scarce yet, or yet: Although I see 'tis he. Why can a thing, That's but my selfe divided be so false? Ser. Nay doe but marke how the chaire plaies his part too: How amorously 'tis bent. Sha. Hell take thy bad thoughts, For they are strange ones. Never take delight To make a torment worse. Look on 'em heaven, For that's a brother: send me a faire enemy, And take him; for a fouler fiend there breathes not: I will not sin, to think there's ill in her, But what's of his producing. Yet goodnesse, whose inclosure is but flesh, Holds out oft times but sorrily. But as black sir, As ever kindred was: I hate mine owne bloud, Because it is so neare thine. Live without honesty, And maist thou dye with an unmoistned eye, And no teare follow thee. Ex. Shamont, Servant. Lad. Y'are wondrous merry sir; I would your Brother heard you. Sold. O my sister I would not out oth' way, let fall my words Lady, Por the precizest humour. Enter Passionate Lord. Pas. Yea, so close. Sol. Th'are merry, that's the worst you can report on 'em; Th'are neither dangerous, nor immodest. Pas. So sir, Shall I believe you, think you? Sold. Who's this Lady? Lad. O the Dukes Cousen; he came late from travel sir. Sold. Respect belongs to him. Pas. For as I said Lady, Th'are merry that's the worst you can report of 'em: Th'are neither dangerous, nor immodest. Sold. How's this? Pas. And there I think I left. Sold. Abuses me. Pas. Now to proceed, Lady; perhaps I swore I lov'd you, If you believe me not, y'are much the wiser. Sol. He speaks still in my person, and derides me. Pas. For I can cog with you. Lad. You can all doe so. We make no question of mens promptness that way. Pas. And smile, &amp; wave a chair with comely grace too, Play with our Tastle gently, and doe fine things, That catch a Lady sooner then a vertue. Sol. I never us'd to let man live so long That wrong'd me. Pa. Talke of Battalions, wooe you in a skirmish: Divine my mind to you Lady; and being sharp set, Can court you at halfe pike: or name your weapon, We cannot faile you Lady. Enter 1 Gen. Sol. Now he dies: Were all succeeding hopes stor'd up within him. 1 Ge. O fie, i'th' Court sir? Sol. I most dearely thanke you sir. 1 Ge. Tis rage ill spent upon a passionate mad-man. Sol. That shall not priviledge him for ever sir: A mad-man call you him? I have found too much reason Sound in his injurie to me, to beleeve him so. 1 Ge. If ever truth from mans lips may be held In reputation with you, give this confidence; And this his love-fit, which we observe still, By's flattering and his finenes: at some other time, Hee'l goe as slovenly as heart can wish. The love and pity that his Highnesse shewes to him, Makes every man the more respectfull of him: Has never a passion, but is well provided for, As this of Love, he is full fed in all; His swinge as I may tearme it: have but patience, And ye shall witnesse somewhat. Sol. Still he mocks me: Looke you, in action, in behaviour sir; Hold still the chaire, with a grand mischiefe to you, Or Ile set so much strength upon your heart sirâ Pa. I feele some power has restrain'd me Lady: If it be sent from love, say, I obey it, And ever keep a voice to welcome it. Song. Thou Deitie, swift winged love, Sometimes below, sometimes above, Little in shape, but great in power, Thou that makest a heart thy Tower, And thy loop-holes, Ladies eyes, From whence thou strik'st the fond and wise. Did all the shafts in thy faire quiver Stick fast in my ambitious liver; Yet thy power would I adore, And call upon thee to shoot more. shoot more, shoot more. Enter one like a Cupid offring to shoot at him. Pas. I prethee hold though, sweet CÃ¦lestiall boy; I'm not requited yet with love enough, For the first arrow that I have within me: And if thou be an equall archer Cupid, Shoot this Lady, and twenty more for me. Lad. Me sir? 1 Gen. Tis nothing but device, feare it not Lady; You may be as good a maid after that shaft Madam, As ere your mother was at twelve and a halfe: Tis like the boy that drawes it, 'tas no sting yet. Cup. Tis like the miserable maid that drawes itâ aside. That sees no comfort yet, seeing him so passionate. Pas. Strike me the Duchesse of Valois in love with me, With all the speed thou canst, and two of her women. Cu. You shall have more. Pas. Tell 'em I tarry for 'em. 1 Gen. Who would be angry with that walking trouble now That hurts none but it selfe? Soul. I am better quieted. Pas. Ile have all women-kind strucke in time for me After thirteene once: I see this Cupid will not let me want, And let him spend his forty shafts an houre, They shall be all found from the Dukes Exchequer; He's come already. Enter againe the same Cupid, two brothers, 6 women Maskers, Cupids bow bent all the way towards them, the first woman singing and playing, A Priest. [Maskers] The Song. O turne thy bow, Thy power we feele and know, Faire Cupid turne away thy bow: They be those golden Arrowes, Bring Ladies all their sorrowes, And till there be more truth in men, Never shoot at maid agen. Pas. What a felicity of whores are here? And all my concubines, strucke bleeding new: A man can in his life time make but one woman, But he may make his fifty Queanes a month. Cu. Have you remembred a Priest honest brothers? 1 Bro. Yes sister, and this is the young gentleman, Make you no question of our faithfulnesse. 2 Bro. His growing shame sister provokes our care. Priest. He must be taken in this fit of love Gentlemen. 1 Bro. What else sir? he shall do't. 2 Bro. Enough. 1 Bro. Be cheerefull wench. A dance, Cupid leading. Pas. Now by the stroake of pleasure, a deep oath. Nimbly hopt Ladies all; what height they beare too? A story higher then your common statures; A little man must go up staires to kisse 'em: What a great space there is Betwixt loves dyning Chamber, and his Garret? Ile trie the utmost heightâthe Garret stoopes methinkes; The roomes are made all bending, I see that, And not so high as a man takes 'em for. Cu. Now if you'l follow me sir, I've that power, To make them follow you. Pas. Are they all shot? Cu. All, all sir, every mothers daughter of 'em. Pas. Then there's no feare of following; if they be once shot, They'l follow a man to th'devillâAs for you sirâ Ex. with the Lady, &amp; the Maskers. Soul. Me sir? 1 Gent. Nay sweet sir. Soul. A noise, a threatning; did you not heare it sir? 1 Gent. Without regard sir, so would I heare you. Soul. This must come to something, never talke of that Sir, You never saw it otherwise. 1 Gen. Nay deare meritâ Soul. Me above all men? 1 Gen. Troth you wrong your anger. Soul. I will be arm'd my honourable Letcher. 1 Gent. O fie sweet sir. Soul. That devoures womens honesties by lumps, And never chawst thy pleasure. 1 Gent. What do you meane sir? Soul. What does he meane t'ingrosse all to himselfe? There's others love a whore, as well as he sir. 1 Gen. Oh an 'that be part o'th furie, we have a Citty Is very well provided for that case; Let him alone with her, sir we have women Are very charitable to proper men, And to a Souldier that has all his limbes; Marry the sicke and lame gets not a penny: Right womens charity, and the husbands follow't too: Here comes his highnesse sir. Enter Duke, and Lords. Soul. Ile walke to coole my selfe. Exit. Du. Who's that? 1 Gen. The brother of Shamont. Du. He's Brother then To all the Courts love, they that love discreetly, And place their friendlinesse upon desert: As for the rest, that with a double face Looke upon merit, much like fortunes visage, That lookes two waies, both to lifes calmes and stormes, Ile so provide for him, chiefly for him, He shall not wish their loves, nor dread their envies. And here comes my Shamont. Enter Shamont. Sha. That Ladies vertues are my only joyes, And he to offer to lay siedge to them? Du. Shamont. Sha. Her goodnesse is my pride; in all discourses, As often as I here rash tongued gallants, Speake rudely of a woman, presently I give in but her name, and th'are all silent: O who would lose this benefit? Du. Come hether sir. Sha. 'Tis like the gift of healing, but diviner; For that but cures diseases in the body, This workes a cure on fame, on reputation: The noblest piece of Surgery upon earth. Du. Shamont; he minds me not. Sha. A Brother do't? Du. Shamont I say. Gives him a touch with his switch. Sha. Ha? If he be mortall, by this hand he perishes; Drawes. Unlesse it be a stroake from heaven, he dies for't. Du. Why, how now sir? 'twas I. Sha. The more's my miserie. Du. Why, what's the matter prethee? Sha. Can you aske it sir? No man else should; stood forty lives before him, By this I would have op'd my way to him; It could not be you sir, excuse him not, What ere he be, as y'are deere to honour, That I may find my peace agen. Du. Forbeare I say. Upon my love to truth, 'twas none but I. Sha. Still miserable? Du. Come, come, what ailes you sir? Sha. Never sate shame cooling so long upon me, Without a satisfaction in revenge, And heaven has made it here a sin to wish it. Du. Harke you sir? Sha. O y'ave undone me. Du. How? Sha. Cruelly undone me; I have lost my peace, and reputation by you: Sir pardon me, I can never love you more. Exit. Du. What language call you this sirs? 1 Gen. Truth my Lord, I've seldome heard a stranger.â 2 Gent. He is a man of a most curious valour, Wondrous precise, and punctuall in that vertue. Du. But why to me so punctuall? my last thought Was most intirely fixt on his advancement: Why, I came now to put him in possession Of his faire fortunes: what a mis-conceiver 'tis? And from a Gentleman of our Chamber meerely, Made him Vice-Admirall; I was setled in't, I love him next to health: call him Gentlemen; Why would not you, or you ha' taken as much, And never murmur'd? Exit. 1 Gent. 2 Gent. Troath, I thinke we should my Lord, And there's a fellow walkes about the Court, Would take a hundred of 'em. Du. I hate you all for't, And rather praise his high pitch'd fortitude, Though in extreames for nicenesse: now I thinke on't, I would I had never done't.âNow sir, where is he? Enter 1 Gentleman. 1 Gent. His sute is only fit to be excus'd. Du. He shall not be excus'd, I love him dearelier: Say we intreat him; goe, he must not leave us. Ex. 2 Gen. So vertue blesse me, I nere knew him parraleld; Why, he's more pretious to me now, then ever. Enter 2 Gent. and Shamont. 2 Gent. With much faire language, w'ave brought him? Du. ThankesâWhere is he? 2 Gent. Yonder sir. Du. Come forward man. Sha. Pray pardon me, I'm asham'd to be seene sir. Du. Was ever such a touchie man heard of? Prethee come nearer. Sha. More into the light? Put not such crueltie into your requests my Lord, First to disgrace me publikely, and then draw me Into mens eyesight, with the shame yet hot Upon my reputation. Du. What disgrace sir? Sha. What? Such as there can be no forgivenesse for, That I can find in honour. Du. That's most strange sir. Sha. Yet I have seartch'd my bosome to find one, And wresled with my inclination, But 'twill not be: would you had kild me sir, With what an ease had I forgiven you then? But to endure a stroke from any hand Under a punnishing Angels, which is justice, Honour disclame that man, for my part chiefly: Had it been yet the malice of your sword, Though it had cleft me, 'thad been noble to me; You should have found my thankes paid in a smile If I had fell unworded; but to shame me, With the correction that your horse should have, Were you ten thousand times my royall Lord, I cannot love you never, nor desire to serve you more. If your drum call me I am vowed to valour, But peace shall never know me yours agen, Because I've lost mine owne, I speake to dye sir; Would you were gratious that way to take off shame, With the same swiftnesse as you powre it on: And since it is not in the power of Monarches To make a Gentleman, which is a substance Only begot of merit, they should be carefull Not to destroy the worth of one so rare, Which neither they can make; nor lost, repaire. Exit. Du. Y'ave set a faire light sir before my judgement, Which burnes with wondrous clearnes; I acknowledge it, And your worth with it: but then sir, my love, My loveâwhat gone agen? 1 Gen. And full of scorne my Lord. Du. That language will undoe the man that keeps it, Who knows no difference twixt contempt and manhood. Upon your love to goodnes, gentlemen, Let me not lose him long: how now? Enter a Huntsman. Hunts. The game's at height my Lord. Du. Confound both, thee and it: hence breake it off; He hates me brings me newes of any pleasure: I felt not such a conflict since I cou'd; Distinguish betwixt worthinesse and bloud Ex.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter the two brothers, 1 Gentleman, with those that were the Maskers, and the Cupid. 1 Gen. I I heartily commend your project Gentlemen, 'Twas wise and vertuous. 1 Bro. 'Twas for the safety Of pretious honour sir, which neere bloud binds us to: He promis'd the poore easie foole there marriage, There was a good maiden-head lost i'th' beliefe on't, Beshrew her hasty confidence. 1 Gen. O no more sir, You make her weep agen; alas poore Cupid: Shall she not shift her selfe? 1 Bro. O by no meanes sir: We dare not have her seen yet, all the while She keepes this shape, 'tis but thought device, And she may follow him so without suspition, To see if she can draw all his wilde passions, To one point only, and that's love, the maine point: So far his highnesse grants, and gave at first, Large approbation to the quicke conceit, Which then was quicke indeed. 1 Gent. You make her blush insooth. 1 Bro. I feare 'tis more the flagg of shame, then grace sir. 1 Gen. They both give but one kind of colour sir: If it be bashfulnesse in that kind taken, It is the same with grace; and there she weepes agen. In truth y'are too hard, much, much too bitter sir, Unlesse you meane to have her weepe her eyes out, To play a Cupid truly. 1 Bro. Come, ha' done then: We should all feare to sin first; for 'tis certaine, When 'tis once lodg'd, though entertain'd in mirth, It must be wept out, if it ere come forth. 1 Gent. Now 'tis so well, I'le leave you. 1 Bro. Faithfully welcome sir, Go Cupid to your charge; hee's your owne now; If he want love, none will be blam'd but you. Cu. The strangest marriage, and unfortunat'st Bride That ever humane memory contain'd; I cannot be my selfe for't. Exit. Clo. Oh Gentlemen? Enter the Clowne. 1 Bro. How now sir, what's the matter? Clo. His melancholly passion is halfe spent already, Then comes his angry fit at the very taile on't, Then comes in my pain gentlemen; has beate me e'ne to a Cullis. I am nothing, right worshipfull, but very pap, And jelly: I have no bones, my body's all one busines, They talk of ribs, &amp; chines most freely abroad i'th' world, Why, I have no such thing; who ever lives to see me dead Gentlemen, shall find me all mummie good to fill galipots And long dildo glasses: I shall not have a bone to throw At a dog. Omnes. Alas poore vassall, how he goes? Clo. O Gentlemen, I am unjoynted, do but thinke o' that: My breast is beat into my mawe, that what I eate, I am faine to take't in all at mouth with spoones; A lamentable hearing; and 'tis well knowne, my belly Is driven into my backe. I earn'd foure Crowns a month, most dearely Gentlemen, And one he must have when the fit's upon him, The privy purse allowes it, and 'tis thriftinesse, He would breake else some fourty pounds in casements, And in five hundred yeares undo the Kingdome: I have cast it up to a quarrell. 1 Bro. There's a fellow kickt about court, I would He had his place brother, but for one fit of his indignation. 2 Bro. And suddenly I have thought upon a means for't. 1 Bro. I Prethee how? 2 Bro. 'Tis but preferring Brother This stockfish to his service, with a letter Of commendations, the same way he wishes it, And then you win his heart: for o' my knowledge He has laied waite this halfe yeare for a fellow That will be beaten; and with a safe conscience We may commend the carriage of this man in't; Now servants he has kept, lusty tall feeders, But they have beate him, and turn'd themselves away: Now one that would endure, is like to stay, And get good wages of him; and the service too Is ten times milder Brother, I would not wish it else. I see the fellow has a sore crush'd body, And the more need he has to be kickt at ease. Clo. I sweet Gentlemen, a kick of ease, send me to such a Master. 2 Bro. No more I say, we have one for thee, a soft footed Master, One that weares wooll in's toes. Clo. O Gentlemen, soft garments may you weare, Soft skins may you wed, But as plump as pillowes, both for white and red. And now will I reveale a secret to you, Since you provide for my poore flesh so tenderly, 'Has hir'd meere Rogues, out of his Chamber window, To beate the Souldier, Mounsier Shamonts Brother. 1 Bro. That nothing concernes us sir. Clo. For no cause Gentlemen, Unlesse it be for wearing shoulder points, With longer taggs then his. 2 Bro. Is not that somewhat? Birlakin sir, the difference of long taggs, Has cost many a mans life, and advanc'd other some, Come follow me. Clo. See what a gull am I: Oh every man in his profession; I know a thumpe now, as juditiously, As the proudest he that walkes, I'le except none; Come to a tagge, how short I fall? I'm gone. Exeunt Enter Lapet. Lap. I have been ruminating with my selfe, What honour a man loses by a kicke: Why, what's a kicke? the fury of a foote, Whose indignation commonly is stampt Upon the hinder quarter of a man; Which is a place very unfit for honour, The world will confesse so much: Then what disgrace I pray, does that part suffer Where honour never comes, I'd faine know that? This being well forc'd, and urg'd, may have the power To move most Gallants to take kickes in time, And spurne out the duelloes out o'th' kingdome, For they that stand upon their honour most, When they conceive there is no honour lost, As by a table that I have invented For that purpose alone, shall appeare plainly, Which shewes the vanity of all blowes at large, And with what ease they may be tooke of all sides, Numbring but twice one the Letters Patience From C. P. to E. I doubt not but in small time To see a dissolution of all bloudshed, If the Reform'd Kick do but once get up: For what a lamentable folly 'tis, If we observ't, for every little justle, Which is but the ninth part of a sound thump, In our meeke computation, we must fight forsooth, yes, If kill, I'm hang'; if I be kil'd my selfe, I dye for't also: is not this trim wisdome? Now for the Con, a man may be well beaten, Yet passe away his fourescore yeares smooth after: I had a father did it, and to my power I will not be behind him. Enter Shamont. Sha. O well met. Lap. Now a fine punch or two, I looke for't duly. Sha. I've been to seeke you. Lap. Let me know your lodging sir, I'le come to you once a day, and use your pleasure sir. Sha. I'm made the fittest man for thy Society: I'le live and dye with thee: come shew me a Chamber; There is no house but thine, but only thine, That's fit to cover me: I've tooke a blow sirrah. Lap. I would you had indeed: why, you may see sir; You'l all come to't in time, when my booke's out. Sha. Since I did see thee last, I've tooke a blow. Lap. Pha sir that's nothing; I ha' tooke fourty since. Sha. What? and I charg'd thee thou shouldst not? Lap. I sir, you might charge your pleasure, But they would giv't me, whether I would or no. Sha. Oh I walke without my peace, I've no companion now; Prethee resolve me, for I cannot aske A man more beaten to experience, Then thou art in this kind, what manner of blow Is held the most disgracefull, or distastefull? For thou dost only censure 'em by the hurt, Not by the shame they do thee: yet having felt Abuses of all kindes, thou mayst deliver, Though't be by chance, the most injurious one. Lap. You put me to't sir; but to tell you truth, Th'are all as one with me, little exception. Sha. That little may do much, let's have it from you. Lap. With all the speed I may: first then, and formost, I hold so reverently of the Bastinado sir, That if it were the dearest friend i'th' world, I'd put it into his hand. Sha. Go too, I'le passe that then. Lap. Y'are the more happy sir, Would I were past it too: But being accustom'd to't, It is the better carried. Sha. Will you forward? Lap. Then there's your sowce, your wherrit, and your dowst, Tuggs on the haire, your bob o'th' lips, a whelpe on't, I nere could find much difference: Now your thumpe, A thing deriv'd first from your Hemp-beaters, Takes a mans wind away, most spitefully: There's nothing that destroyes a Collicke like it, For't leaves no wind i'th' body. Sha. On sir, on. Lap. Pray give me leave, I'm out of breath with thinking ont. Sha. This is far off yet. Lap. For the twinge byth' nose, 'Tis certainly unsightly, so my tables saies, But helpes against the head-ache, woundrous strangely. Sha. Is't possible? Lap. O your crush'd nostrils slakes your opilation And makes your pent powers flush to wholsome sneezes. Sha. I never thought there had been halfe that vertue In a wrung nose before. Lap. O plenitude sir: Now come we lower, to our moderne kick, Which has been mightily in use of late, Since our young men dranke Coltsfoot: and I grant you, 'Tis a most scornefull wrong, cause the foot plaies it; But marke agen, how we that take't, requite it With the like scorne, for we receive it backeward; And can there be a worse disgrace retorted? Sha. And is this all? Lap. All but a lugg byth' eare, Or such a trifle. Sha. Happy sufferer, All this is nothing to the wrong I beare: I see the worst disgrace, thou never felt'st yet; It is so far from thee, thou canst not thinke on't; Nor dare I let thee know, it is so abject. Lap. I would you would though, that I might prepare for't, For I shall ha't at one time or another: If't be a thwacke, I make account of that; There's no new fashion'd swappe that ere came up yet, But I've the first on 'em, I thanke 'em for't. Enter the Lady, and Servants. Lad. Hast thou enquir'd? 1 Ser. But Can heare nothing Madam. Sha. If there be but so much substance in thee To make a shelter for a man disgrac'd, Hide my departure from that glorious woman That comes with all perfection about her: So noble, that I dare not be seene of her, Since shame tooke hold of me: upon thy life No mention of me. Lap. I'le cut out my tongue first, Before I'le loose my life, there's more belongs to't. Lad. See there's a Gentleman, enquire of him. 2 Ser. For Mounsier Shamont Madam? Lad. For whom else sir? 1 Ser. Why, this fellow dares not see him. Lad. How? 1 Ser. Shamont Madam? His very name's worse then a feavour to him, And when he cries, there's nothing stils him sooner; Madam, your Page of thirteene is to hard for him, 'Twas tri'd i'th' wood-yard. Lad. Alas poore grieved Merit! What is hecome of him? if he once faile, Vertue shall find small friendship: farewell then To Ladies worths, for any hope in men, He lov'd for goodnesse, not for Wealth, or lust, After the worlds foule dotage, he nere courted The body but the beauty of the mind, A thing which common courtship never thinkes on: All his affections were so sweet and faire, There is no hope for fame if he dispaire. Ex. Lad. and Ser. Enter the Clowne. He kicks Lapet. Lap. Good morrow to you agen most heartily sir, Crie you mercy I heard you not, I was somewhat busie. Clo. He takes it as familiarly, as an Ave, Or pretious salutation: I was sicke till I had one, Because I am so us'd to't. Lap. How ever you deserve, your friends &amp; mine, here Give you large commendations i' this Letter, They say you will endure well. Clo. I'd be loath To prove 'em liers: I've endur'd as much As mortall pen and Inke can set me downe for. Lap. Say you me so? Clo. I know and feele it so sir, I have it under black and white already; I need no pen to paint me out. Lap. He fits me, And hits my wishes pat, pat: I was nere In possibility to be better man'd, For he's halfe lam'd already, I see't plaine, But take no notice on't, for feare I make The Rascall proud, and deare, to advance his wages; First let me grow into particulars with you; What have you indur'd of worth? let me heare. Clo. Marry sir, I'm almost beaten blind. Lap. That's pretty well for a begining, But many a milhorse has endur'd as much. Clo. Shame o' the millers heart for his unkindnesse then. Lap. Well sir, what then? Clo. I've been twice throwne down staires, just before supper. Lap. Puh, so have I, that's nothing. Clo. I but sir, Was yours pray before supper? Lap. There thou posest me. Clo. I marry, that's it, 't'ad been lesse griefe to me, Had I but fil'd my bellie, and then tumbled, But to be flung downe fasting, there's the dolour. Lap. It would have griev'd me, that indeed: proceed sir. Clo. I have been pluck'd &amp; tugg'd bith' haire o'th' head About a gallerie, halfe an Acre long. Lap. Yes, that's a good one, I must needs confesse, A principall good one that, an absolute good one, I have bin trod upon, and spurn'd about, But never tugg'd byth' haire, I thanke my fates. Clo. O 'tis a spitefull paine. Lap. Peace, never speake on't, For putting men in mind on't. Clo. To conclude, I'm bursten sir: my belly will hold no meat. Lap. No? that makes amends for all. Clo. Unlesse't be puddings, Or such fast food, any loose thing beguiles me, I'm nere the better for't. Lap. Sheepheads will stay with thee? Clo. Yes sir, or Chaldrons. Lap. Very well sir: Any your bursten fellowes must take heed of surfets: Strange things it seemes, you have endur'd; Clo. Too true sir. Lap. But now the question is, what you will endure Hereafter in my service? Clo. Any thing That shall be reason sir, for I'm but froath; Much like a thing new calv'd, or come more nearer sir, Y'ave seen a Cluster of Frog-spawns in April, E'ne such a starche am I, as weak and tender As a green woman yet. Lap. Now I know this, I will be very gently angry with thee, And kick thee carefully. Clow. O I sweet sir. Lap. Peace, when thou art offer'd well, lest I begin now. Your friends and mine have writ here for your truth, They'll passe their words themselves and I must meet 'em. Clow. Then have you all: Exit. As for my honesty there is no feare of that, For I have ne're a whole bone about me. Exit. Musick. Enter the passionate Cousen, rudely, and carelesly Apparell'd, unbrac'd, and untrust: The Cupid following. Cup. Think upon love, which makes all creatures handsome, Seemly for ey-sight; goe no so diffusedly, There are great Ladies purpose sir to visit you. Pas. Grand plagues, shut in my casements, that the breaths Of their Coach-mares reek not into my Nostrills; Those beasts are but a kinde of Bawdy fore-runners. Cup. It is not well with you, When you speak ill of faire Ladies. Pas. Faire mischiefs, give me a nest of Owles, and take 'em; Happy is he say I, whose window opens To a browne Bakers chimney, he shall be sure there To heare the Bird sometimes after twi-light: What a fine thing 'tis me thinks to have our garments Sit loose upon us thus, thus carelessely, It is more manly, and more mortifying; For w'are so much the readier for our shrouds: For how ridiculous wer't, to have death come, And take a fellow pinn'd up like a Mistris? About his neck a Ruffe, like a pincht Lanthorne, Which Schoole-boyes make in winter; and his dublet So close and pent; as if he fear'd one prison Would not be strong enough, to keep his soule in; But's Tailor makes another: And trust me, for I know't when I lov'd Cupid, He does endure much paine, for the poore praise Of a neat sitting suit. Cup. One may be handsome sir, And yet not pain'd, nor proud. Pas. There you lie Cupid, As bad as Mercurie: there is no handsomenesse, But has a wash of Pride and Luxury, And you goe there too Cupid. Away dissembler, Thou tak'st the deeds part which befooles us all; Thy Arrow heads shoot out sinners: hence away, And after thee Ile send a powerfull charme, Shall banish thee for ever. Cup. Never, never, I am too sure thine owne. Exit. Pas. Sings. Hence all you vaine Delights, As short as are the nights, Wherein you spend your folly, Ther's nought in this life sweet, If man were wise to see't, But onely Melancholy, O sweetest melancholy. Welcome folded Armes, and fixed eyes, A sigh that piercing mortifies, A look that's fastned to the ground, A tongue chain'd up without a sound. Fountaine heads, and pathlesse Groves, Places which pale passion loves: Moon-light walkes, when all the fowles Are warmly hous'd, save Bats and Owles; A mid-night Bell, a parting groane, These are the sounds we feed upon; Then stretch our bones in a still gloomy valley, Nothing's so daintie sweet as lovely melancholy. Exit. Enter at another doore Laper, The Cupids Brothers watching his comming. 1 Br. So, so, the Wood-cock's gin'd; Keep this doore fast brother. 2 Bro. Ile warrant this. 1 Bro. Ile goe incense him instantly; I know the way to't. 2 Bro. Wil't not be too soon think you, And make two fits break into one? 1 Bro. Pah, no, no; The taile of his melancho Is alwayes the head of his anger, and followes as close, As the Report followes the powder. Lap. This is the appoynted place, and the houre struck, If I can get security for's truth, Ile never minde his honesty: poore worme, I durst lay him by my wife, which is a benefit Which many masters ha'not: I shall ha' no maid Now got with childe, but what I get my selfe, And that's no small felicity: In most places Th'are got by th' men, and put upon the Masters: Nor shall I be resisted when I strike, For he can hardly stand; these are great blessings. Pas. I want my food, deliver me a varlet. within. Lap. How now: from whence comes that? Pas. I am allow'd a Carcasse to insult on; Where's the villaine? Lap. He meanes not me I hope. Pas. My maintenance rascals; my Bulk, my exhibition. Lap. Blesse us all, What name's are these? would I were gone agen. The passionate man enters in furie, with a Truncheon, He Sings: A curse upon thee for a slave, Art thou here, and heard'st me rave? Fly not sparkles from mine eye, To shew my indignation nye? Am I not all foame, and fire? With voice as hoarse, as a Towne-crier? How my back opes and shuts together, VVith furie, as old mens with weather? Could'st thou not heare my teeth knash hither? Lap. No truely sir, I thought t'had been a Squirrell, Shaving a Hazle-nut. Pas. Death, hell, fiends, and darknesse, I will thrash thy mangy carcasse. Lap. O sweet sir. Pas. There cannot be too many Tortures. Spent upon those louzie Quarters. Lap. Hold, oh. Falls down for dead. Pas. Thy bones shall rue, thy bones shall rue. Sings again. Thou nafly, scurvie, mongrill Toad, Mischief on thee; Light upon thee, All the plagues That can confound thee Or did ever raigne abroad: Better a thousand lives it cost, Then have brave Anger spilt or lost. Exit. Lap. May I open mine eyes yet, and safely peep? Ile trie a groane firstâohâNay then hee's gone. There was no other policy but to dye, He would ha' made me else. Ribs are you sore? I was ne're beaten to a tune before. Enter the two Brothers. 1 Bro. Lapet. Lap. Agen? Falls againe. 1 Bro. Look, look, hee's flat agen, And stretched out like a Coarse a handfull longer Then he walks trust me brother. Why Lapet. I hold my life we shall not get him speak now. Monsieur Lapet; it must be a privie token, If any thing fetch him, hee's so far gone. We come to passe our words for your mans truth. Lap. O gentlemen y'are welcom: I have been thrasht i'faith. 2 Bro. How? thrasht sir? Lap. Never was Shrove-tuesday Bird So cudgel'd gentlemen. 1 Bro. Pray how? by whom sir? Lap. Nay that I know not. 1 Bro. Not who did this wrong? Lap. Only a thing came like a walking song. 1 Bro. What beaten with a Song? Lap. Never more tightly, gentlemen: Such crotchets happen now and then, methinks, He that endures well, of all water's drinks. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. ScÃ¦na prima. Enter Shamonts Brother, the Souldier, and 1. Gent. Sold. Yes, yes, this was a Madman, sir, with you, A passionate Madman. 1. Gent. Who would ha' lookt for this sir? Sold. And must be priviledg'd? a pox priviledge him: I was never so dry beaten since I was borne, And by a litter of rogues, meer rogues, the whole twenty Had not above nine elbowes amongst 'em all too: And the most part of those left-handed rascalls, The very vomit, Sir, of hospitalls, Bridewells, and Spittle-houses; such nasty smellers, That if they'd been unfurnish'd of Club-Trunchions, They might have cudgel'd me with their very stinks, It was so strong, and sturdy: and shall this, This filthy injurie, be set off with madnesse? 1 Gen. Nay take your owne blouds councel sir, hereafter, Ile deale no further in't: if you remember, It was not come to blowes, when I advis'd you. Sold. No, but I ever said, 'twould come to something, And 'tis upon me, thank him: were he kin To all the mighty Emperours upon earth, He has not now in life three houres to reckon; I watch but a free time. Enter Shamont. 1 Gen. Your noble brother, sir, Ile leave you now. Ex. Sha. Souldier I would I could perswade my thoughts From thinking thee a brother, as I can My tongue from naming on't: thou hast no friend here, But fortune and thy owne strength, trust to them. Sold. How? what's the incitement, sir? Sha. Treacherie to vertue; Thy treacherie, thy faithlesse circumvention: Has Honour so few daughters, never fewer, And must thou aime thy treacherie at the best? The very front of vertue? that blest Lady? the Dukes sister? Created more for admirations cause, Then for loves ends; whose excellency sparkles More in divinity, then mortall beauty; And as much difference 'twixt her minde and bodie, As 'twixt this earths poore center and the Sun: And couldst thou be so injurious to faire goodnesse, Once to attempt to court her down to frailty? Or put her but in minde that there is weaknesse, Sin, and desire, which she should never heare of? Wretch, thou'st committed worse then Sacrilege, In the attempting on't, and oughtst to dye for't. Sold. I rather ought to doe my best, to live, sir; Provoke me not; for I've a wrong sits on me, That makes me apt for mischiefe; I shall lose All respects suddainly of friendship, Brother-hood, Or any sound that way. Sham. But 'ware me most; For I come with a two-edg'd injurie; Both my disgrace, and thy apparent falshood, Which must be dangerous. Sold. I courted her, sir: Love starve me with delayes when I confesse it not. Sham. There's nothing then but death Can be a pennance fit for that confession. Sold. But farre from any vitious taint. Sham. O sir, Vice is a mighty stranger growne to courtship. Sold. Nay then the fury of my wrong light on thee. Enter 1. Gentleman, and others. 1 Gen. Forbeare, the Duke's at hand, Here, hard at hand, upon my reputation. Sold. I must doe something now. Ex. Sold. Sham. Ile follow you close sir. 1 Gen. We must entreat you must not; for the Duke Desires some conference with you. Sh. Let me goe, As y'are gentlemen. 2 Gent. Faith we dare not sir. Sham. Dare ye be false to honour, and yet dare not Doe a man justice? give me leaveâ 1 Gent. Good sweet sir. H'as sent twice for you. Sham. Is this brave, or manly? 1 Gent. I prethee be conform'd. Sham. Deathâ Enter Duke. 2 Gent. Peace, hee's come introth. Sham. Oh have you betraid me to my shame afresh? How am I bound to loath you? Duk. Shamont, welcome, I sent twice. 2 Gent. But my Lord, he never heard on't. Sham. Pray pardon him, for his falsenesse, I did Sir, Both times; I'de rather be found rude then faithlesse. Du. I love that bluntnesse dearely: ha's no vice. But is more manly then some others vertue, That less it out onely for shew or profit. Sham. Wil't please you quit me sir, I've urgent busines? Du. Come, you'r so hasty now: I sent for you To a better end. Sham. And if it be an end, Better or worse, I thank your goodnesse for't. Du. I've ever kept that bounty in condition, And thankfulnesse in bloud, which well becomes Both Prince and Subject, that where any wrong Beares my impression, or the hasty figure Of my repented anger, I'me a Law Ev'n to my selfe, and doome my selfe most strictly To Justice, and a noble satisfaction: So that, what you in tendernesse of honour, Conceive to be losse to you, which is nothing But curious opinion, Ile restore agen, Although I give you the best part of Genoa, And take to boot but thanks for your amends. Sham. O miserable satisfaction, Ten times more wretched then the wrong it selfe; Never was ill better made good with worse: Shall it be said that my posterity Shall live the sole heires of their fathers shame? And raise their wealth and glorie from my stripes? You have provided nobly bounteous sir, For my disgrace, to make it live for ever, Out-lasting Brasse or Marble: This is my feares construction, and a deep one, Which neither argument nor time can alter: Yet I durst sweare, I wrong your goodnesse in't sir, And the most faire intent on't, which I reverence With admiration, that in you a Prince, Should be so sweet, and temperate a condition, To offer to restore where you may ruine, And do't with justice, and in me a servant, So harsh a disposition, that I cannot Forgive where I should honor, and am bound to't. But I have ever had that curiosity In bloud, and tenderness of reputation, Such an antipathy against a blow, I cannot speak the rest: Good sir discharge me, It is not fit that I should serve you more, Nor come so neare you; I'me made now for privacy, And a retir'd condition, that's my suit, To part from Court for ever, my last suit. And as you professe bounty, grant me that, Sir. Du. I would deny thee nothing. Sham. Health reward you, sir. Exit. Du. He's gone agen already, and takes hold Of any opportunity, not riches Can purchase him, nor honours, peaceably, And force were brutish: what a great worth's gone with him, And but a gentleman? well, for his sake, Ile nere offend more those I cannot make: They were his words, and shall be deare to memorie. Say I desire to see him once agen; Yet stay, hee's so well forward of his peace, 'Twere pitty to disturbe him: he would groane Like a soule fetch'd agen; and that were injurie, And I've wrong'd his degree too much already. Call forth the gentlemen of our chamber instantly. 1 Serv. I shall my Lord. Within. Du. I may forget agen, And therefore will prevent: The strain of this Troubles me so, one would not hazard more. Enter 1. Gent. and divers other. Gent. Your will my Lord? Du. Yes; I discharge you all. 2 Gent. My Lordâ Du. Your places shall be otherwise dispos'd of. 4 Gent. Why sir? Du. Reply not, I dismisse you all: Y'are gentlemen, your worths will find you fortunes; Nor shall your farewell taxe me of ingratitude, Ile give you all noble remembrances, As testimonies 'gainst reproach and malice, That you departed lov'd. 3 Gen. This is most strange, sir. 1 Gen. But how is your grace furnish'd, these dismis'd? Du. Seek me out Grooms. Men more insensible of reputation, Lesse curious and precise in termes of honour, That if my anger chance let fall a stroak, As we are all subject to impetuous passions, Yet it may passe unmurmur'd, undisputed, And not with braver fury prosecuted. Exit. 1 Gen. It shal be done, my Lord. 3 Gen. Know you the cause sir? 1 Gen. Not I kinde gentlemen, but by conjectures, And so much shall be yours, when you please. 4. Thanks sir. 3 Gen. VVe shal ith' mean time think our selves guilty Of some foule fault, through ignorance committed. 1 Gen. No, 'tis not that, nor that way. 4 Gen. For my part, I shall be dis-inherited, I know so much. 1 Gen. Why sir, for what? 4 Gen. My sire's of a strange humour, Hee'll forme faults for me, and then sweare 'em mine, And commonly the first begins with leacherie. He knowes his owne youthes trespasse. 1 Gen. Before you goe, Ile come and take my leave, and tell you all sirs. 3 Gen. Thou wer't ever just and kinde. Exit. 1 Gen. That's my poore vertue sir, And parcell valiant; but it's hard to be perfect: The chusing of these fellowes now will puzzle me, Horribly puzzle me; and there's no judgement Goes true upon mans out-side, there's the mischiefe: He must be touch'd, and try'd, for gold or drosse; There is no other way for't, and that's dangerous too; But since I'me put in trust, I will attempt it: The Duke shal keep one daring man about him: Enter a Gallant Soft, who comes here? a pretty bravery this: Every one goes so like a gentleman, 'Tis hard to finde a difference, but by th'touch. Ile trie your mettall sure. Gal. Why what doe you meane sir? 1 Gen. Nay, and you understand it not, I doe not. Gal. Yes, would you should well know, I understand it for a box o'th' eare Sir. 1 Gent. And o' my troth, that's all I gave it for. Gal. 'Twere best it be so. 1 Gen. This is a brave Coward, A jolly threatning Coward; he shall be Captaine: Sir, let me meet you an houre hence i'th' Lobby. Gal. Meet you? the world might laugh at me then i'faith. 1 Ge. Lay by your scorn &amp; pride, they're scurvy qualities, And meet me, or Ile hox you while I have you, And carrie you gambril'd thither like a Mutton. Gal. Nay, and you be in earnest, here's my hand I will not faile you. 1 Gen. 'Tis for your owne good. Gal. Away. 1 Gent. Too much for your own good, sir, a pox on you. Gal. I prethee curse me all day long so. 1 Gen. Hang you. Gal: Ile make him mad; hee's loth to curse too much to me; Indeed I never yet took box oth' eare, But it redounded, I must needs say soâ 1 Gent. Will you be gone? Gal. Curse, curse, and then I goe. Look how he grins, I've anger'd him toth' kidnyes. Ex. 1 Gen. Was ever such a prigging coxcombe seen? One might have beat him dumbe now in this humour, And hee'd ha' grind it out still: Enter a plain fellow. O here's one made to my hand, Methinks looks like a Craven; Lesse paines will serve his triall: some slight justle. Pl. f. How? take you that sir: And if that content you notâ 1 Gen. Yes very well sir, I desire no more. Pl. f. I think you need not; For you have not lost by't. Exit. 1 Gen. Who would ha' thought this would have prov'd a gentleman? Ile never trust long chins and little legs agen, Ile know 'em sure for gentlemen hereafter: A gristle but in shew, but gave his cuffe With such a fetch, and reach of gentrie, As if h'had had his armes before the floud; I have took a villanous hard taske upon me; Now I begin to have a feeling on't. Enter Lapet, and Clowne his servant, and so habited. O here comes a tri'd piece, now, the reformed kick. The millions of punches, spurnes, and nips That he has endur'd? his Buttock's all black Lead, He's halfe a Negro back-ward; he was past a Spaniard In eighty eight, and more Egyptian-like; His Table and his Book come both out shortly, And all the Cowards in the Towne expect it; So, if I faile of my full number now, I shall be sure to finde 'em at Church corners, Where Dives, and the suff'ring Ballads hang. Lap. Well, since thou art of so milde a temper, Of so meek a spirit, thou maist live with me, Till better times doe smile on thy deserts. I am glad I am got home againe. Clow. I am happy in your service, sir, You'll keep me from the Hospitall. Lap. So, bring me the last proofe, this is corrected. Clow. I, y'are too full of your correction, sir. Lap. Look I have perfect Books within this half houre. Clow. Yes sir. Lap. Bid him put all the Thumps in Pica Roman, And with great Tees, (you vermin) as Thumps should be. Clow. Then in what Letter will you have your Kicks? Lap. All in Italica, your Backward blowes All in Italica, you Hermophrodite: When shall I teach you wit? Clow. O let it alone, Till you have some your selfe su. Lap. You mumble? Clow. The Victualls are lockt up; I'me kept from mumbling. Exit. Lap. He prints my Blows upon pot-paper too, the rogue, Which had been proper for some drunken Pamphlet. 1 Gen. Monsieur Lapet? how the world rings of you su? Your name sounds far and neare. Lap. A good report it beares, for an enduring nameâ 1 Gen. What luck have you sir? Lap. Why, what's the matter? 1 Gent. I'me but thinking on't. I've heard you wish this five yeare for a place. Now there's one fall'n, and freely without money too; And empty yet, and yet you cannot hav't. Lap. No? what's the reason? Ile give money for't, Rather then goe without sir. 1 Gen. That's not it, sir; The troth is, there's no gentleman must have it Either for love or money: 'tis decreed so; I was heartily sorrie when I thought upon you. Had you not been a gentleman I had fitted you. Lap. Who I a gentleman? a pox I'me none, sir. 1 Gen. How? Lap. How? why did you ever think I was? 1 Gen. What? not a gentleman? Lap. I would thou'dst put it upon me i'faith. Did not my Grand-father cry Coney-skins? My father AquavitÃ¦? a hot gentleman: All this I speak on i' your time and memorie too; Onely a rich Unckle dy'd and left me chattells, You know all this so well tooâ 1 Gen. Pray excuse me, sir, ha' not you Armes? Lap. Yes, a poore couple here. That serve to thrust in wild-fowle. 1 Gen. Heralds Armes, Symbols of gentrie, sir: you know my meaning; They've been shewn and seen. Lap. They have. 1 Gen. I fex have they. Lap. Why I confesse, at my wives instigation once, (As women love these Heralds kickshawes naturally) I bought 'em: but what are they think you? puffs. 1 Gen. Why, that's proper to your name being Lapet. Which is La fart, after the english letter. Lap. The Herald, sir, had much a doe to finde it. 1 Gen. And can you blame him? Why 'tis the onely thing that puzzles the devill. Lap. At last he lookt upon my name agen, And having well compar'd it, this he gave me, The two Cholliques playing upon a winde instrument. 1 Gen. An excellent proper one: but I pray tell me, How does he expresse the Cholliques? They are hard things. Lap. The Cholliques? with hot trenchers at their bellies, There's nothing better, Sir, to blaze a Chollique. 1 Gen. And are not you a gentleman by this sir? Lap. No, I disclaime't: no belly-ake upon earth Shall make me one: he shall not think To put his gripes upon me, And wring out gentrie so, and ten pound first. If the winde instrument will make my wife one, Let her enjoy't, for she was a Harpers Grand-childe: But sir, for my particular, I renounce it. 1 Gen. Or to be call'd so? Lap. I sir, or imagin'd. 1 Gen. None fitter for the place: give me thy hand. Lap. A hundred thousand thanks, beside a Bribe sir. 1 Gen. You must take heed Of thinking toward a gentleman, now. Lap. Pish, I am not mad, I warrant you: nay more sir, If one should twit me i'th' teeth that I'me a gentleman, Twit me their worst, I am but one since Lammas, That I can prove, if they would see my heart out. 1 Gen. Marry in any case keep me that evidence. Enter Clowne. Lap. Here comes my servant, Sir, Galoshio, Has not his name for nought, he will be trod upon: What sayes my Printer now? Clow. Heres your last proof Sir. You shal have perfect Books now in a twinkling. Lap. These marks are ugly. Clow. He sayes, sir, they're proper: Blows should have marks, or else they are nothing worth. La. But why a Peel-crow here? Clow. I told 'em so sir: A Scar-crow had been better. Lap. How Slave? looke you Sir, Did not I say, this Whirrit, and this Bob, Should be both Pica Roman. Clow. So said I Sir, both Picked Romans, And he has made 'em Welch Bills, Indeed I know not what to make on 'em. Lap. Hay-day; a Souse, Italica? Clow. Yes, that may hold Sir, Souse is a bonaroba, so is Flops too. Lap. But why stands Bastinado so farre off here? Clo. Alas you must allow him room to lay about him, sir. La. Why lyes this Spurne lower then that Spurn, sir? Clow. Marry this signifies one kickt downe staires, sir, The other in a Gallerie: I ask'd him all these questions. 1 Gen. Your Books name? Prethee Lapet minde me, you never told me yet. La. Marrie but shall sir: 'tis call'd The up-rising of the kick, And the downfall of the Duello. 1 Gen. Bring that to passe you'll prove a happy member, And doe your Countrey service: your young blouds Will thank you then, when they see foure-score. Lap. I hope To save my hundred Gentlemen a month by't, Which will be very good for the private house. Clow. Look you, your Table's finish'd sir already. Lap. Why then behold my Master-piece: see, see, sir, Here's all your Blowes, and Blow-men whatsoever, Set in their lively colours, givers, and takers. 1 Gen. Troth wondrous fine, sir. Lap. Nay, but mark the postures, The standing of the takers I admire more then the givers, They stand scornfully, most contumeliously, I like not th? Oh here's one cast into a comely figure. Clow. My Master meanes him there that's cast downe headlong. Lap. How sweetly does this fellow take his Dowst? Stoops like a Cammell, that Heroick beast, At a great load of Nut-megs; and how meekly This other fellow here receives his Whirrit? Clow. Oh Master here's a fellow stands most gallantly, Taking his kick in private behinde the hangings, And raising up his hips to't. But oh, sir, How daintily this man lies trampled on? Would I were in thy place, what e're thou art: How lovely he endures it? 1 Gen. But will not these things, sir, be hard to practise, think you? Lap. Oh, easie, sir: Ile teach 'em in a Dance. 1 Gent. How? in a dance? Lap. Ile lose my new place else, What ere it be; I know not what 'tis yet. 1 Gen. And now you put me in minde, I could employ it well, For your grace, specially: For the Dukes cozen Is by this time in's violent fit of mirth, And a devise must be sought out for suddainly, To over-cloy the passion. Lap. Say no more, sir, Ile fit you with my Schollers, new practitioners, Endurers of the time. Clow. Whereof I am one sir. 1 Gen. You carry it away smooth; give me thy hand, sir. Exeunt.</field>

O Brothers, oh, I fear 'tis mortall: help, O helpe, I'me made the wretched'st woman, by this accident, That ever love beguil'd. Enter 2. Brothers. 2 Bro. We are undone Brother, Our shames are too apparent: Away receptacle Of Luxury, and dishonour, most unfortunate, To make thy selfe but luckie to thy spoile, After thy Sexes manner: lift him up Brother; He breathes not to our comfort, hee's too wasted Ever to cheere us more: A Chirurgeon speedily; Hence; the unhappiest that ere stept aside, Shee'll be a Mother before shee's known a Bride. Cup. Thou hadst a most unfortunate conception, What ere thou prov'st to be; in midd'st of mirth Comes ruine, for a welcome, to thy birth. Exeunt. ScÃ¦ne 2. Enter Shamont. Sham. This is a beautifull life now; privacie The sweetnesse and the benefit of essence: I see there is no man, but may make his paradice; And it is nothing, but his love, and dotage Upon the worlds fowle joyes, that keeps him out on't: For he that lives retir'd in minde, and spirit, Is still in paradice, and has his innocence, Partly allow'd for his companion too, As much as stands with justice: here no eyes Shoot their sharp pointed scornes upon my shame; They know no termes of reputation here, No punctuall limits, or precise dimensions; Plaine downe-right honestie is all the beauty And elegancy of life found amongst shepheards; For knowing nothing nicely, or desiring it, Quits many a vexation from the minde, With which our quainter knowledge does abuse us; The name of envy is a stranger here, That dries mens blouds abroad, robs health and rest, Why here's no such fury thought on: no, nor falsehood, That brotherly disease, fellow-like devill, That plaies within our bosome, and betrayes us. Enter 1 Gent. 1 Gen. Oh are you here? Sham. La Nove, 'tis strange to see thee. 1 Gen. I ha' rid one horse to death, To finde you out, sir. Sham. I am not to be found of any man That saw my shame, nor seen long. 1 Gen. Good, your attention: You ought to be seen now, and found out sir, If ever you desire before your ending To performe one good office, nay a deare one, Mans time can hardly match it. Sham. Bee't as pretious As reputation; if it come from Court I will not heare on't. 1 Gen. You must heare of this, Sir. Sham. Must? 1 Gen. You shall heare it. Sham. I love thee, that thoul't dye. 1 Gen. 'Twere nobler in me, Then in you living: you will live a murderer, If you deny this office. Sha. Ev'n to death sir. 1 Gen. Why then you'l kill your brother. Sham. How? 1 Gent. Your Brother sir: Beare witnesse heaven, this man destroyes his brother When he may save him, his least breath may save him: Can there be wilfuller destruction? He was forc'd to take a most unmanly wrong, Above the suff'ring vertue of a Soldier, Has kill'd his Injurer, a work of honour; For which, unlesse you save him, he dyes speedily My conscience is discharg'd, I'me but a friend, A Brother should goe forward where I end. Exit. Sham. Dyes? Say he be naught, that's nothing to my goodnesse, Which ought to shine through use, or else it loses The glorious name 'tis knowne by: hee's my brother; Yet peace is above bloud: Let him goe; I, But where's the noblenesse of affection then? That must be car'd for too, or I'me imperfect, The same bloud that stood up in wrath against him, Now in his miserie runs all to pity; I'de rather dye than speak one sillable To save my selfe: but living as I am, There's no avoiding on't, the worlds humanity Expects it hourely from me: curse of fortune, I took my leave so well too: Let him dye, 'Tis but a brother lost; so pleasingly, And swiftly I came off, 'twere more then irksomnesse, To tread that path agen; and I shall never Depart so handsomly: But then where's posterity? The consummation of our house and name? I'me torne in pieces betwixt love and shame. Exit. ScÃ¦ne 3. Enter Lapet, Clown, Poultrot, Moulbazon, and others, the new Court Officers. Lap. Good morrow fellow Poltrot, and Moulbazon, Good morrow fellowes all. Pol. Mounsieur Lapet? Lap. Look, I've remembred you, here's booksa piece for you. Moul. O sir, we dearely thank you. Lap. So you may; There's two impressions gone already sirs. Pol. What no? in so short a time? Lap. 'Tis as I tell you sir, My Kick sells gallantly, I thank my stars. Clo. So does your Table; you may thank the Moon too. Lap. 'Tis the Book sells the Table. Clow. But 'tis the Book-seller That has the money for 'em, I'me sure o'that. Lap. 'Twill much enrich the Company of Stationers, 'Tis thought 'twill prove a lasting benefit, Like the Wise Masters, and the Almanacks, The hundred Novells, and the Book of Cookerie, For they begin already to engrosse it, And make it a stock-book, thinking indeed 'Twill prove too great a benefit, and help, For one that's new set up: they know their way, And make him Warden, ere his beard be gray. Moul. Is't possible such vertue should lye hid, And in so little paper? Lap. How? Why there was the Carpenter, An unknowne thing, an odoriferous Pamphlet, Yet no more Paper, by all computation, Then Ajax Telamon would use at once, Your Herring prov'd the like, able to buy Another Fishers Folly, and your Pasquill Went not below the mad-caps of that time, And shall my elaborate Kick come behinde think you? Clow. Yes, it must come behinde, 'tis in Italica too, According to your humour. Lap. Not in sale, varlet. Clow. In sale, sir? it shall saile beyond 'em all I troe. Lap. What have you there now? oh, Page, 21. Clow. That Page is come to his yeares, he should be a serving-man. La. Mark how I snap up the Duello there: One would not use a dog so, I must needs say; but's for the common good. Clow. Nay sir, your Commons seldome fight at sharp, But buffet in a ware-house. Lap. This will save Many a gentleman of good bloud from bleeding sirs, I have a curse from many a Barber Surgeon; They'd give but too much money to call't in; Turne to Page 45. see what you finde there. Clow. O out upon him, Page 45. that's an old theefe indeed. Enter Duke, the Lady his sister, 1 Gent. Lap. The Duke, clap down your Books; away Galoshio. Clow. Indeed I am too foule to be ith' presence, They use to shake me off at the chamber door still. Ex. Lady. Good my Lord, grant my suit; let me not rise Without the comfort on't: I have not often Been tedious in this kinde. Du. Sister, you wrong your selfe, And those great vertues that your fame is made of, To waste so much breath for a Murderers life. Lad. You cannot hate th'offence more then I doe, sir, Nor the offender, the respect I owe Unto his absent brother, makes me a suitor, A most importunate sister; make me worthy But of this one request. Duk. I am deafe To any importunacy, and sorry For your forgetfulnesse; you never injur'd Your worth so much, you ought to be rebuk'd for't: Pursue good wayes, end as you did begin, 'Tis halfe the guilt to speak for such a sin. Lad. This is loves beggerie right, that now is ours, When Ladies love, and cannot shew their powers. Ex. Du. La Nove? 1 Gen. My Lord. Du. Are these our new attendants? Lap. We are my Lord, and will endure as much As better men, my Lord, and more I trust. Du. What's hee? 1 Gen. My Lord, a decay'd Gentleman, That will doe any service. Du. A decay'd one? 1 Gent. A renounc'd one indeed; for this place only. Du. We renounce him then go, discharge him instantly. He that disclaimes his gentry for meere gaines, That man's too base to make a vassaile on. Lap. What saies the Duke? 1 Gen. Faith little to your comfort sir, You must be a gentleman agen. Lap. How? 1 Gent. There's no remedy. Lap. Marry, the fates forfend: ne're while I breath sir. 1 Gen. The Duke will have it so, there's no resisting. He spide it i' your fore-head. Lap. My wife's doing. She thought she should be put below her betters now, And su'd to ha' me a gentleman agen. 1 Gent. And very likely sir: Marry Ile give you this comfort when all's done, You'll never passe but for a scurvey one, That's all the helpe you have: come shew your pace. Lap. The heaviest gentleman that e're lost place; Beare witnesse I am forc't to't. Exit. Duke. Though you have a courser title yet upon you, Then those that left your places, without blame, Tis in your power to make your selves the same: I cannot make you gentlemen, that's a work Rais'd from your owne deservings; merit, manners, And in-borne vertue doe's it. Let your own goodnesse Make you so great, my power shall make you greater; And more t'encourage you, this I adde agen, There's many Grooms now exact Gentlemen. Enter Shamont. Sham. Me thinks 'tis strange to me to enter here: Is there in nature such an awfull power, To force me to this place? and make me doe this? Is mans affections stronger then his will? His resolution? was I not resolv'd Never to see this place more? Doe I beare Within my breast one bloud that confounds th'other? The bloud of love, and will, and the last weakest? Had I ten Millions, I would give it all now, I were but past it, or 'twould never come; For I shall never do't, or not do't well, But spoyle it utterly betwixt two passions. Yonder's the Duke himselfe, I will not do't now, Had twenty lives their severall sufferings in him. Exit. Duke. Who's that went out now? Pol. I saw none, my Lord. Du. Nor you? Moul. I saw the glimpse of one my Lord. Du. What ere it was, methought it pleas'd me strangly, And suddenly my joy was ready for't. Did you not marke it better? Pol. &amp; Moul. Troth my Lord, We gave no great heed to't. Enter Shamont. Sham. 'T will not be answer'd, It brings me hither still; by maine force hither: Either I must give over to professe humanity, Or I must speak for him. Duke. 'Tis here agen: No marvaile 'twas so pleasing, 'tis delight And worth it selfe, now it appeares unclouded. Sham. My Lordâ He turnes away from mee: by this hand I am ill-us'd of all sides: 'tis a fault That fortune ever had t'abuse a goodnesse. Duke. Methought you were saying somewhat. Sham. Marke the Language, As coy as fate; I see 'twill nere be granted. Du. We little look'd in troth to see you here yet. Sham. Not till the day after my brothers death, I think. Du. Sure some great businesse drew you. Sha. No insooth, sir, Onely to come to see a brother dye sir, That I may learne to goe too; and if he deceive me not, I think he will doe well in't of a souldier, Manly, and honestly: and if he weep then, I shall not think the worse on's man-hood for't, Because hee's leaving of that part that has it. Duk. Has slaine a noble gentleman, thinke on't, sir? Sham. I would I could not sir. Duk. Our Kinsman too. Sham. All this is but worse sir. Du. When 'tis at worst, Yet seeing thee, he lives. Sham. My Lordâ Du. He lives, Believe it as thy blisse, he dyes not for't: Will this make satisfaction for things past? Sham. Oh my Lordâ Du. Will it? speak. Sh. With greater shame to my unworthinesse. Du. Rise then, wee're ev'n: I never found it harder To keep just with a man: my great work's ended. I knew your brothers pardon was your suit, sir, How ever your nice modestie held it back. Sham. I take a joy now, to confesse it, sir. Enter 1. Gent. 1 Gent. My Lordâ Du. Heare me first, sir, what e're your newes be: Set free the Souldier instantly. 1 Gen. Tis done, my Lord. Du. How? 1 Gen. In effect: 'twas part of my newes too, There's faire hope of your noble kinsmans life sir. Du. What saist thou? 1 Gen. And the most admired change That living flesh e're had; he's not the man my Lord; Death cannot be more free from passions, sir, Then he is at this instant: hee's so meek now, He makes those seem passionate, was never thought of: And for he feares his moods have oft disturb'd you sir, Hee's onely hasty now for his forgivenesse, And here behold him sir. Enter Passion, the Cupid, and two brothers. Du. Let me give thanks first: our worthy Cousenâ Pas. Your unworthy trouble sir; For which, with all acknowledg'd reverence, I aske your pardon; and for injurie More knowne and wilfull, I have chose a wise, Without your counsell, or consent, my Lord. Duke. A wife? where is she sir? Pas. This noble Gentlewoman. Duk. How? Pas. Whose honour my forgetful times much wrong'd. Du. Hee's madder then he was. 1 Gen. I would ha' sworne for him. Du. The Cupid, cousen? Pas. Yes, this worthy Lady, sir. Du. Still worse and worse. 1 Bro. Our sister under pardon, my Lord. Du. What? 2 Bro. Which shape Love taught her to assume. Du. Is't truth then? 1 Ge. It appears plainly now below the waste my Lord. Du. Shamont, didst ever read of a she-Cupid? Sham. Never in fiction yet: but it might hold sir; For Desire is of both Genders. Enter the Dukes sister. Du. Make that good here: I take thee at thy word, sir. He joyns Shamonts hand and his Sisters. Sham. O my Lord, Love would appeare too bold, and rude from me, Honour and admiration are her rights, Her goodnesse is my Saint, my Lord. Duke. I see, Y'are both too modest to bestow your selves: Ile save that vertue still; 'tis but my paines: come, It shall be so. Sham. This gift does but set forth my poverty. Lady. Sir, that which you complaine of is my riches. Enter Shamonts brother the Souldier. Du. Soldier, now every noise sounds peace, th'art welcome. Sol. Sir my repentance sues for your blest favour, Which once obtain'd, no injury shall lose it; Ile suffer mightier wrongs. Duk. Rise, lov'd and pardon'd; For where hope fail'd, nay Art it selfe resign'd, Thou'st wrought that cure, which skil could never find; Nor did there cease, but to our peace extend; Never could wrongs boast of a nobler end. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue at the reviving of this Play. It's growne in fash'on of late in these dayes, To come and beg a sufferance to our Playes; Faith Gentlemen our Poet ever writ Language so good, mixt with such sprightly wit, He made the Theatre so soveraigne With his rare ScÃ¦nes, he scorn'd this crowching veine: We stabb'd him with keene daggers when we pray'd Him write a Preface to a Play well made. He could not write these toyes; 'twas easier farre, To bring a Felon to appeare at th'Barre, So much he hated basenesse; which this day, His ScÃ¦nes will best convince you of in's Play,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue. Our Poet bid us say for his owne part, He cannot lay too much forth of his Art: But feares our over-acting passions may, As not adorne, deface his labour'd Play: Yet still he is resolute for what is writ Of Nicer valour, and assumes the wit: But for the Love-ScÃ¦nes which he ever meant, Cupid in's Petticoat should represent, Hee'll stand no shock of censure; the Plaie's good, He sayes he knowes it, (if well understood.) But we (blinde god) begge, if thou art divine, Thou'lt shoot thy Arrowes round, this Play was thine.</field>
