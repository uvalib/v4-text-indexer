      <field name="fulltext">HENRY the SECOND; OR, THE FALL of ROSAMOND: A TRAGEDY;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Poor artless Maid, to stain thy spotless Name, Expence, and Art, and Toil united strove, To lure a Breast that felt the purest Flame, Sustain'd by Virtue, but betray'd by Love. Shenstone's Elegies.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. I hold it an indispensible Duty to mention some Circumstances, which gave Birth to the following Scenes, wherein I shall not only indulge my Pride, but, perhaps, in some Degree, palliate the Boldness, and (as it may be thought by many) Presumption of my Understanding. The Fable and Conduct of this Tragedy were projected as long ago as the Year 1761, by the late Mr. Shenstone, at his sweet Retirement, the Leasowes, in Warwickshire. Herein consists my Pride, that I enjoyed a happy (but too short) Intimacy with that amiable and accomplished Man. In the Summer of that same Year, See Mr. Shenstone's Letter, No. 105, to Mr. Graves, Sept. 14, 1761. Mr. Shenstone had been present at the Performance of a hasty Alteration of Mr. Hawkins's Tragedy of Henry and Rosamond, which I produced at the Theatre at Birmingham, for the temporary Use of a particular Friend. Undigested and imperfect as it was, that excellent Judge said, there was a Pathos in the Story, which, notwithstanding the Defects of the Drama, made the Representation very pleasing; and he signified his Wonder that such an affecting and popular Tale should not have found its Way to the Stage. Hence arose many Conversations on the Subject, all which terminated in his advising me to make the Story my own. The known Kindness of his Heart, perhaps, gave me Credit for greater Abilities, than I really possessed. He continued to encourage me with a Warmth which flatters me in the Recollection; and, after I had left Warwickshire, obliged me with several Letters to the same Purpose, which I still preserve as valuable Relicts. In one of those Letters he suggested the Character of the Abbot; in Order, as he said, to add a little more Business to a Story, which otherwise might be too barren to furnish Matter for five Acts. It may easily be supposed I forthwith adopted his Idea, and carefully treasured in my Mind every Sentiment he let fall on this, as well as other Subjects; and I can say, with great Truth, that among the many Conversations I enjoyed with that excellent Man, I never knew one from which I did not derive considerable Instruction, as well as Delight. The unexpected Loss of this most estimable Friend He died Feb. 11, 1763. (which will ever be lamented by all who knew him) dispirited me from the Undertaking, and I laid aside my Plan, together with all his Letters, till the Beginning of last Year. The Scheme itself, it is true, had often, in the Interval, occurred to my Remembrance, but a Doubt of my Ability to execute it, even in a passable Manner, deterred me from the Attempt. Mrs. Hartley's Arrival at Covent-Garden Theatre, and the warm Solicitations of a Friend, induced me once more to resume the Design. The happy Suitability (if I may be allowed the Phrase) of her Figure, to the Description of Rosamond (as may be found in Dr. Percy's amusing and instructive Collection of old Ballads, Vol. ii Page 137) viz. Her crisped Lockes, like Threads of Golde, Appear'd to each Man's Sight; Her sparkling Eyes, &amp;c. &amp;c. assisted by the Softness and Gentleness of her Demeanour, encouraged me, at length, to make the Attempt; and the unniversal Aprobation given by the Public to her Appearance, Manner and Performance, on the first Representation of this Play, happily convinced me I was not singular in my Opinion. In the general Execution of the Piece I have paid a particular Attention to the old Ballad, and endeavoured at a Simplicity of Style, both which Mr. Shenstone earnestly recommended. I am not conscious of any further Helps, except having adopted the Idea (not the Matter) of an Interview between the King and Clifford in the Monastery, from Mr. Hawkins. I had originally made Clifford die of a broken Heart, under the Sanction of the Death of King Lear, as originally drawn by that great Master of human Nature, Shakespeare; but the general Opinion of the Public, and the Persuasions of my Friends, induced me to vary my Design in the Representation. I have little further to add, but my Intreaties that the Reader will be pleased to judge with Lenity, what was undertaken with Diffidence. Advised, assisted, and encouraged as I was originally, to this Undertaking, by the Possessor of such eminent Abilities, and such Benignity of Disposition, I seek no living Patron, but pride myself in having this Opportunity to dedicate my humble Production, With the warmest Affection and Gratitude,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MEMORY OF WILLIAM SHENSTONE, ESQ. Westminster, January 19, 1774.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE, Written and Spoken by the AUTHOR. Long Time oppress'd with painful Doubts and Fears, At length the dread decisive Hour appears, The awful Trial comes! and here I stand, T'abide the Verdict of my native Land. Will not the Judge himself for Favour plead, When the poor trembling Culprit owns the Dead; When in false Arts he scorns to seek Support, But throws him on the Mercy of the Court? Such is my State, whom wild Ambition draws To stand the Judgment of dramatic Laws; Bold the Attempt, (and, much I fear, in vain) That I, the humblest in the Muses' Train, Should dare produce; in this nice-judging Age, My own weak Efforts on the dang'rous Stage! Had I the slightest Touch of plaintive Rowe, Whose Numbers oft have bade your Sorrows flow, Your Plaudit undismay'd I might implore, And Rosamond might plead, like hapless Shore: But as it is, your Kindness be my Friend, For that alone I sueâto that I bend. If by an artless Tale, in artless Strain, A mild and patient Hearing I obtain, And my poor Labours o'er, behold ye part With unpain'd Ear and undisgusted Heart, 'Twere Triumph and Delight! but if the Lays, Deserve your Censure, which aspir'd to Praise, Ev'n to your Kindness will I not presume, Nor strive to deprecate my proper Doom; This sole Indulgence let my Fault procure, Mildly inflict, submissive I endure.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE, an Apartment in Salisbury's House. Enter Clifford and Salisbury. CLIFFORD. Salisbury, no more; seek not with empty Words To talk down Grief like mine; hadst thou a Child, Whom thy fond Heart had dwell'd and doated on, As mine on Rosamond, and felt'st the Pang Of seeing her devote her matchless Beauty To lawless Love, her Dignity and Virtue To Infamy, and Shame, thou would'st not brook Vain Consolation. SALISBURY. Judge not I esteem Thy Suff'rings light, or think thy Pains will yield To cold Philosophy. CLIFFORD. NoâWou'dst thou ease The tortur'd Wretch, thou must sit down beside him, Shed Tear for Tear, in sympathizing Silence; List to the Tale which Sorrow loves to tell, And, by partaking the distressful Cause, Sooth the strong Woe that will not be controul'd. SALISBURY. Give thy full Bosom Vent, thy Friend shall wait With patient and participating Heart. CLIFFORD. I ask but that; for shou'dst thou weary Language, Ransack the Stores of subtle Sophistry, For deepest Argumentsâmy simple Answer Confutes and baffles allâI've lost my Child. SALISBURY. I grant it, Lord, and meant alone to stand A friendly Mediator 'twixt thyself And the o'er-ruling Tumults of thy Mind. I dread their Violence. Did'st thou not talk Of Vengeance and Redress? Whence shou'd they spring? Where wou'dst thou point them? Say, is this a Time To add to Henry's Troubles? now, when dark Intestine Feuds and foreign Foes combine To shake his Throne and Peace? CLIFFORD. Cousin, thou call'st A Blush to these old Cheeks, at the bare Thought Of what thy Words imply. Think'st thou I mean, Had this weak Arm the highest Power of Vengeance, To stain my native Land with civil Slaughter? No, Heaven forefend! nor should a Danger reach My Sovereign's sacred Life. Were there a Wretch Accurs'd enough to raise his trait'rous Arm 'Gainst Henry's Breast, Clifford would rush between, Oppose himself to the Assassin's Point, And glory in the Death that sav'd his King. SALISBURY. My Mind's at Peace. CLIFFORD. So rest it, noble Salisbury! Shall I be plain, and tell thee all my Weakness? 'Spite of ungrateful Henry's Perfidy, 'Spite of the Sorrows that assail my Heart, I love him still, I love this royal Robber. In early Youth I led him to the Field, Train'd his advent'rous Spirit, shar'd his Dangers, And by his Side maintain'd my Country's Honour, In many a gallant Feat; Oh, hard Return! How hath he paid this Love! SALISBURY. When headlong Passions Mislead him not from his instinctive Greatness, How nobly shews he! Wisdom, Learning, Policy, Inform his Mind, and gen'rous Honour sways it. CLIFFORD. Where was it fled, that Guardian of Man's Heart When, with insidious Arts, in evil Hour, He lur'd my chaste, my duteous Rosamond From Virtue and Obedience? Was she not All that a Parent's fondest Wish could form? In vain her modest Grace and Diffidence Bore the dear Semblance of her Mother's Sweetness, And promis'd an unsullied Length of Days. She's lost, and the bright Glories of our Line Are stain'd in her Disgrace. SALISBURY. Thy pious Heart, Alive to all the Dangers and Mishaps That wait on tempting Beauty, doth not need My interposing Voice to wake soft Pity For the lost Rosamond. The Love of Goodness Not wholly leaves the Breast that Error stains, But oft abides, a wholesome Monitor, To call the miserable Culprit back To its forsaken Laws. So may it fare With her. 'Tis true the King, when in her Sight, Engrosses all her Thoughts; but in her secret And solitary Hours, sad she regrets Her ruin'd Innocence, and mourns that Love Which led her to destroy a Father's Peace, And stain the Honours of a spotless Line. CLIFFORD. To save her from a deeper Plunge in Guilt Is all my present Purpose; 'gainst the King, No other Weapons do I mean to use, But those which best become the manly Heart, Reason and Conscience; let him give her back, Stain'd and dishonour'd as the Mourner is, Let him restore her to these aged Arms, I ask no more. SALISBURY. Unfold thy utmost Wish, And if a Friend's Assistance may avail, Command thy Kinsman's warmest Services. CLIFFORD. Conceal my being here: let not the King Know Clifford treads these Bounds; he must be won To my Discourse, unconscious who I am. I have devis'd a Meansâenquire not now, But patient aid me, and await the Issue. I have good Hopes that all the gen'rous Fires, Which warm'd his noble Heart, are not extinct; If so, I may once more embrace my Child, My still dear Rosamond.âBlame not my Weakness, I cannot lose the Father in the Judge, I seek not to inflict but banish Pain; T'awaken in her Breast a just Remorse For her past Failings; and entice her Steps To some serene Abode, where Penitence And Contemplation dwell, and jointly sooth The contrite Sinner's Mind, with glowing Hopes Of Heaven's Indulgence, and its promis'd Grace. [Exeunt. SCENE II. A retir'd Grove belonging to the Palace. Enter Prince of Wales and Leicester. PRINCE. My Spirit will not brook it! What avails The empty Name and Title of a King, Without imperial Pow'r! why with his Son Divide his Throne, unless he meant to grant A Share of that supreme Authority, Which only lends Stability to Greatness And gives its highest Lustreâto be caught With the gay tinsell'd Garb of Royalty, Befits an Ideot only; let him know That Henry's Son inherits Henry's Pride, And may in Time, with daring Hand, assume What now he is debarr'd. LEICESTER. Your Wrongs are great; But be not too precipitate and rash, Lest you therein defeat the Means by which You wish to gain. Beware, the watchful Eye Of Curiosity besets our Paths; Speak not so loud. PRINCE. What Danger? Shou'd the King Himself o'er-hear, confront me Face to Face, I would not shrink; mine Eye should not abate Its angry Fire, nor my sunk Heart recall The smallest Drop of that indignant Blood That paints my glowing Cheek; but I wou'd speak, Avow, proclaim, and boast my settled Purpose: I have a double Cause to urge me on, A royal Mother's Wrongs join'd to my own. Do I not see her injur'd, scorn'd, abandon'd, For the loose Pleasures of a Wanton's Bed, His beauteous Minion, whom embower'd he keeps In Woodstock's mazy Walks? Shall he do this Un-notic'd, un-reproach'd, yet dare to check My honest Ardour? He hath yet to learn, That Parent who expects his Son to walk Within the decent Pale of rigid Duty, Should keep a heedful Watch o'er his own Steps, And by his Practice well enforce the Doctrine He means to have him learn. LEICESTER. Yet check this Passion, And hear the Dictates of my cooler Mind. Is not the Council here conven'd this Morn, By Henry's Order, to debate the Courtesy Of the French Monarch, who even now invites Thy royal Presence to his gallant Court, On friendly Visit? PRINCE. Yesâand here the Partner In England's Throne waits, till their mighty Wisdoms Shall have determin'd what his Course must be, And deign to call him in; waits like a servile And needy Pensioner, that asks a Boon. LEICESTER. Again you lapse into this wild Extreme. Forget a while Ambition and Revenge, And court cool Wisdom; act the Politician; Play to their Humours, yield to their Decrees; Use this French Journey, as the happy Step To mount to your Desires.âTho' here depriv'd Of Pow'r, in Normandy your Half-King Title Enables you to scatter Favours round, Such as shall gain you popular Applause And win your Subjects' HeartsâThis Point obtain'd, All you can ask is yours; you may command Where now you sue, and Henry's Self may fear Your Potency, and grant your highest Wish. PRINCE. By Heav'n thou hast inflam'd my eager Soul With bright Imaginations of Renown, Of Conquest and Ambition; I a while Will try to sooth this proudly swelling Heart, Into mild Heavings, and submissive Calms, For this great Purpose. LEICESTER. To your Aims devoted, I'll privily away, and meet you there; Will worm myself into each Norman Breast; Pour in their greedy Ears your early Virtues, Your Love of them, their Interest and Honour; Then join in any hardy Enterprise That Fore-thought can suggest, and win the Palm, Or die beside thee. PRINCE. Gen'rous, gallant Friend! I have not Words to thank theeâto my Breast Let me receive the Guardian of my Glory, In full Assurance that his noble Friendship Shall never be forgot. LEICESTER. Behold, the Queen; She moves this Way. PRINCE. I will retire a while; I would not meet her, till this hop'd Departure Be fix'd irrevocably, lest her fond Maternal Love and Softness might prevail O'er that instinctive Yielding in the Breast, Which Nature wakens when a Mother sues, And win some Promise from my pliant Heart, That I should scorn to break. [Exit. LEICESTER. What if I try To win her to our Cause? The frequent Wrongs Which fire her haughty Mind, join'd to Affection For her young Henry, may engage her Help In any Scheme that promises Revenge. But softâthe present is no Time for that; For with her comes that busy meddling Abbot, That Dealer in dark Wiles, who rules and guides The Consciences of all who weakly crouch To his Mock-Sanctity. I will avoid himâ Even now some Mischief broods within his Mind! Perhaps tow'rd me; for he, of late, hath shewn me Marks of Respect and Courtesy, wherein He was not wont to deal. Time only will Explain the Object of his present Aims, For in his Proteus-Face, or even his Words, No smallest Trace of what employs his Thoughts Can ever be descry'd. [Exit. Enter QUEEN and ABBOT. QUEEN. Tell me no more Of long-protracted Schemes and tedious Wiles; My Soul is all Impatience: Talk to me Of Vengeance, speedy Vengeance. ABBOT. What can be Devis'd to punish, pain, and mortify, Beyond what is enjoin'd on Henry's Head? Tho' distant from the venerable Shrine, Where martyr'd Becket's sacred Blood was spill'd, Is he exempt from Penance? Doth not here Our careful Mother-Church pursue her Foe? Is he not nightly doom'd to tread the lone And solemn Isles of Ida's holy House, In deep Attonement for the barb'rous Fall Of that dear murder'd Saint? QUEEN. And what attones For Eleanor's loud Wrongs, her murder'd Peace? Will all the Penances e'er yet devis'd By dronish Priests, relieve my tortur'd Heart? Will they recall my Henry's truant Love, Or blast the Charms of that deluding Witch, Who lures him from me? This is the Redress Which Eleanor demandsâthis the Revenge Alone, which she can condescend to take. ABBOT. Nor is this past my Hope to purchase for you: My Thoughts, devote to you and your Repose, Continually labour for your Good. Alas! you know not, mighty Queen, the Sighs My Heart has heav'd, the Tears mine Eyes have shed, For your injurious Treatment; and, even now, Would you but bid your just Resentment cool, I think the wish'd Occasion is at Hand, That gratifies your most enlarg'd Desire. QUEEN. Thy Words are Balsam to my wounded Peace. Go on, go on; dwell on this pleasing Strain, And I will worship thee. ABBOT. Is not the Council Conven'd by Henry? Do they not decree Your darling Son shall strait for France? QUEEN. Ay, there Again is England's Queen insulted, mock'dâ Have I no Right of Choice? Shall the dear Boy, Whose noble Spirit feels his Mother's Wrongs, Shall he be banish'd from me, torn away, My only Comforter? ABBOT. He must not go. You must prevent itâpractise every Art; Nay, bid your Pride and fierce Resentment bend To soft Request and humblest Supplication, Ere suffer his Departure. QUEEN. Tell me, Father, How this is to be done. Canst thou speak Peace To the tumultuous Bosom of the Deep, When the loud Tempest tears it? Can I meet With patient Meekness my Oppressor's Sight? Wear an apparent Calmness in my Face, While heaving Anguish struggles in my Mind? It will not be. ABBOT. There are no other Means. What tho' the Council urge State-Policy, And Public-Good, for their Consent herein, Their inward Aim is to oblige the King, Who labours this great Point. And what's his Drift? No courteous Scheme, to please his Brother France: But merely to remove the gallant Prince. QUEEN. Say'st thou? ABBOT. He fears a Rival in the Hearts Of discontented Subjects; the brave Youth, With Speech undaunted, that disdains Disguise, Hath freely spoke your Wrongs: Hence Jealousy Broods in the King, lest your aspiring Son May prove, in Time, a Bane to his Pursuits, In wanton Dalliance, and illicit Love. QUEEN. Is this the End of all his boasted Care For my Son's Weal, his Happiness and Honour? This the great Cause his Brother. France must see Th'all-praised Heir of England's mighty Throne? Oh, Henry! Whither is thy Greatness sled? Is thy bold Pride, thy Majesty of Heart, Sunk in low Stratagems and mean Deceits? So will it ever be; when Perfidy Pollutes the Soul; the Sense of Honour flies, And Fraud and Meanness fill the vacant Seat. ABBOT. Lose not the precious Hours in useless Reasonings; Speed to the Presence; seize the first fair Moment: Hang on his Garment, clasp his stubborn Knees; Foil Art with Art, and practise every Means To win the King from this abhorr'd Design. QUEEN. I go; howe'er ill-suited to the Task, I will essay it.âStoop, exalted Heart, A Moment stoop; and, Tongue, learn thou a new, An unbeseeming Lesson; let the Cause, The noble Motive, consecrate the Means. Remember, Eleanor, thou fall'st a while, To rise more glorious; to record thy Name Amid the fairest Legends of Renown, A brave Avenger of thy Sex's Wrongs. [Exit. ABBOT. Go, shallow Woman! thy impatient Soul, That mounts to Frenzy at each slight Surmise Of Injury, makes thee a precious Tool For deep-laid Policy to work withal. The Prince must here abideâhis tow'ring Pride, And Leicester's hot and enterprizing Genius, Assisted by my subtle Aid, may raise A Storm that shall destroy this haughty King, This Poison to our Cause and holy Order. Henry, thou know'st not what a Foe thou hast In this un-mitigable Breastâmy Soul Abhors thee, and will never know Repose, Till thou hast fall'n a Victim to my Rage. The greatest, noblest Cause inspires my Deeds! Look down, Oh, sainted Becket! with Delight, On thy true Servant! Let thy blessed Spirit Assist my Purpose, while I seek Revenge On him who dar'd insult our holy Faith, By instigating sacrilegious Hands With thy dear Blood to stain our hallow'd Shrines. [Exit. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE, an Apartment in the Palace. Enter the KING and VERULAM. KING. True, Verulam, and it must be thy Care To check this growing Pride, which mounts so fast, And like the forward Sapling boldly strives To emulate the lofty Cedar's Height, Which long hath tower'd in unrivall'd Strength, The Glory of the Wood. VERULAM. That Zeal and Love, Which hitherto hath won my Master's Confidence, Long as the Life-blood warms this aged Heart, Shall be employ'd to serve him: but this asks The nicest Caution; soft Advice must sooth His head-strong Spirit, that, on the least Surmise Of an usurp'd Authority, would start Aside, indignant of Controul. KING. To thee, Thy Love and Prudence, we confide the Whole. Thy polish'd Sense, thy Knowledge of Mankind, And long Experience, render thee most fit For this great Task. VERULAM. The Time of his Departure, Is it yet fix'd? KING. On our Decree alone That Point depends; he shall with Speed away; These rude Commotions, that assail us round, May call us from our Realm; should it prove so, He must not here remain; his Stay were fatal. VERULAM. Not so, I hope, my Liege. KING. Prudence enjoins Our strictest Caution. What his own Ambition Might of itself attempt, we cannot say, But there's a farther Danger to be fear'd. VERULAM. His Virtues will defend him from such Deeds, As Honour and Obedience must alike Condemn; and he has Virtues which, I trust, Will cast a Lustre o'er his rising Years, When the flight Indiscretions of his Youth Are buried in Oblivion. KING. I trust so, too; Yet, Verulam, where splendid Virtues grow Great Errors also shoot; his Time of Life Is now in that capricious, wavering State, When the soft Bosom is susceptible Of ev'ry new Impression; his Colleague, (From whom we wish him sunder'd) subtle Leicester, Is ever at his Ear, watchful to seize Th'unguarded Moment of the youthful Heart, When dark Insinuations may prevail Upon his ductile Mind. Be thou in Readiness, On our first Notice. VERULAM. This important Point, Which waited only, what this Morn hath given, The Council's Sanction, hath been long debated. I am prepar'd, my Leige. KING. Behold our Son! Enter the PRINCE. Henry, the Council, zealous for thy Welfare, The ripe Improvement of thy growing Virtues, And the successive Glories of our Line, Have by their Voices sanctified our Will, In thy Departure hence. Go, reap that Profit Which the discerning and ingenious Mind Gains from new Climes, that Knowledge of the World, Of Laws, of Customs, Policy, and States, Which Observation yields alone, and Books And learned Guides imperfectly convey. PRINCE. I thank my Father's Love; the Council wisely Bend to thy Will; they but allot what else Had been demanded by the future Heir, And present Partner in th'imperial Seat. My glowing Youth and kindling Spirit scorn To live coop'd up within one scanty Bound: Would Life permit, it were Delight to trace Each scepter'd Region of the peopled World, To mark, compare, define their various Modes, And glean the Wisdom that results from all. KING. Blest in th'Inheritance of England's Throne, This Ardour well befits thee. Go, my Henry, Visit our Brother France; there shine a Star Of this rich Diadem; let the bright Dawn Of thy young Virtues glitter in their Eyes; Those Virtues which shall grace this glorious Isle, When we are low in Dust. PRINCE. And shew a Heart Prepar'd to vindicate each royal Due, With the last Drop that warms its swelling Veins. KING. Spoke with a free-born SpiritâYet beware, Be not impetuous to grasp at Power, Nor use it, when obtain'd, beyond the Limits Of Reason and Uprightness; in the Monarch Do not forget the Man. This honest Lord, An able Counsellor and steady Friend, We make Companion of thy Expedition; Receive him, Henry, from thy Father's Hand, Worthy thy Friendship, wear him near thy Heart; And should some hasty Warmth mislead thy Youth, Be his white Hairs the rev'rend Monitors, To warn thee back to the neglected Path, From which thy Steps had stray'd. PRINCE. I love his Virtues, And thus receive the Man my Sire esteems. Enter the QUEEN. QUEEN. Must I then lose him? Is he not my Son? Or has a Mother's Tongue no Right to plead In her own Sufferings? Oh, my Lord, my Henry, Stand thou between thy Wife, and the hard Sentence Of Men, who feel not the soft Ties of Nature, And give me back my Boy. KING. Madam, forbear! Parental Feelings in my Bosom sway, Strong as in thine. Is he not lost alike To Henry as to Eleanor? Subdue This unbecoming Weakness, that prefers Self-Satisfaction to the public Weal. He must away. QUEEN. Alas! there was a Time When Henry's Speech had falter'd o'er and o'er, Ere he had utter'd, with determin'd Breath, So harsh a Sentence. Is that Time forgot? âNay, turn not from me, Henry! doth thy Heart Shame to avow the Guests it harbour'd once, Fond Love and gentle Pity? PRINCE. Cease, my Mother, Oh, cease to interrupt my Course of Glory; I go but for a Season, to return More worthy thy Endearments. QUEEN. Art thou, too, A Traitor to my Peace? And dost thou wish To fly a Mother's Arms? To leave her here, Helpless and unprotected! Oh, my Son! Oppose not thou my Wish, but rather join To melt a Father's Heart. KING. 'Twere useless, Madam; Think who thy Husband is, and what his Ties. How light, how wavering must he appear In public Eyes, should he abjure the Point He hath just labour'd! Recollect thyselfâ Thou canst not wish him so to slight the Claims Of Wisdom, and of Honour. QUEEN. Nor the Claims, The soft'ning Duties of domestic Life; The Claims of Happiness, of inward Peace, Which long my Heart hath sigh'd for. KING. Eleanor, Once more, remember who we are; a King That will not brook to be arraign'd and school'd For petty Indiscretions. Henry judges His own Mis-doings, and the Chastisement Must be inflicted by his conscious Mind, Not the bold Railings of another's Tongue. QUEEN. I will be mild, be patient, be advis'd; I do recall my Words, revoke each free, Each hasty Breath of my unguarded Speech, Which hath offended thee; henceforth I bend My Temper to thy Will, thy nicest Wish, So I may keep my Son. KING. No moreâthou askest What cannot be. QUEEN. Thus lowly on my Knee Will I turn Suppliant for him. KING. Oh, forbear! That Posture ill becomes us both. I grieve Thou shou'dst be so importunate, for what We must not, cannot, will not grant. QUEEN. For this Have I debas'd myself? Hath England's Queen Bent lowly to the Earth, to be denied A Suit, the Mother had a Right to claim? My Heart swells high, indignant of the Meanness, And scorns itself for such Servility. KING. Prefer a proper Suit, thou can'st not ask What Henry shall refuse. QUEEN. Oh no! Thy Grants, Thy kind consenting Smiles, thy soothing Accents, Thy Love, thy Faith, are all withdrawn from Eleanor, And given to another; conscious Shame O'er-pow'rs me, while I own they once were dear: But I will now forget them, rase them out From my officious Mem'ry, which hath dar'd To call them back to my insulted Heart. KING. Well doth this Railing, which thy Fury promis'd, Warn us to part; our Kindness meant to give Some Days Indulgence to the Mother's Feelings. QUEEN. I scorn both that and thee. PRINCE, [Aside.] My Bosom swells, Impatient of her Wrongsâdown, down, a while, The Timeâthe Time will comeâ KING. Lord Verulam, Prepare thee, on the Instant; he shall hence Before yon Sun decline. If thou hast aught Of Love or Duty for thy Mother's Ear, Thou hast free License, Henry, to employ The present Moments in that pious Office; Yet take good Heedâlet not a Woman's Weakness Melt thy Resolves, and tempt thee to forget The Debt thou ow'st thy Country and thy King. [Exit with Verulam. PRINCE. Restrain those precious Drops, my dearest Mother, That trembling stand in thy swoll'n Eyes, and shew Like the full Bubblings on the Fountain's Brim, Pressing to pass their Bounds; abate this Grief, And bid thy Bosom rest. QUEEN. If thou behold'st One Tear disgrace mine Eye, fierce Indignation, Not Grief, hath call'd it forthâaway, awayâ Seem not solicitous about the Cause That pains thee not; thou art no more a Son, No more a Comfort to thy Mother's Woe. PRINCE. Oh, by the Hopes I have of future Fame, I do not merit these ungentle Terms. Revoke thy Wordsâresume those gentle Strains, Which wont to fall upon thy Henry's Ear, And Nature's Feelings will unsluice my Heart In Blood to thy Complainings. QUEEN. Art not thou Join'd with the rest, a Foe to my Repose? See'st thou not how thy Mother is neglected, Abandon'd, scorn'd? Yet thou canst yield Obedience To the Decrees of him who thus insults me, And leave me to my Wrongs. PRINCE. Can I oppose A Parent's absolute Command? Oh, Madam! Think on my State, how critically nice; 'Twixt two such urgent Claims, how hard to judge! I must resist a King and Father's Power, Or seem neglectful of a Mother's Woes. Judge me not so; even while I own the Strength Of this imperial Mandate, and prepare To speed for France, I feel for your Afflictions, Lament your helpless State, and could, with Joy, Yield up my Life, to save you from Disgrace. QUEEN. There spoke my Son again! Oh, my dear Henry! If thy Soul's Truth confirms these precious Words, (And that it does, I trust that starting Tear) Reflect what further must betide my Life, What future Hoards of Misery and Shame Fate hath to pour upon my wretched Head. My Share in the imperial Seat, my Life Even now, perchance, is doubtful; all Ills threaten; And when the mighty Measure is complete, When every Breast, but thine, is callous tow'rd me, Must I call out in vain for my Defender? Or must I yield my Spirit to my Wrongs, And poorly die beneath them? PRINCE. Ere the Hour Arrive, that should behold that dire Event, I would myself redress thee, wou'd excite My Norman Subjects in thy just Defence; Wou'd head them, and oppose my vengeful Sword To each oppressive Breast, (save One alone) To vindicate thy Rights. Enter VERULAM. VERULAM. The King, my Lord, Expects you. PRINCE. I attend him strait. [Exit Verulam. QUEEN. This Haste Hath Malice in it. PRINCE. Heed it not, my Mother; This Journey (if my Guess deceive me not) Shall be the Source of Good; and on thy Head May all that Good descend! Be Death my Lot, So I give Peace to thee! QUEEN. I will not shame Thy noble Spirit with weak wom'nish Tears, Or one disgraceful Sigh. Wilt thou remember Thy Mother's Wrongs? PRINCE. I will. QUEEN. Adieu, begone; [Exit Prince. Glory and Bliss be thine! This gallant Boy (So my prophetic Mind forebodes) shall prove My great Avenger, and Oppression's Scourge. Perfidious Henry! thou impell'st my Soul To these Extremes; thou mak'st me what I am. Hadst thou continu'd, what I knew thee once, Endearing, tender, fondâbut hence the Thought! Let me shun that, lest my great Heart recoil, And shrink inglorious from its mighty Task. Why comes he not? This Abbot! Oh, 'tis well. Enter the ABBOT. Where are thy Councils now? Thy subtle Schemes? All weak and un-availingâI am lost; Sunk in my own Esteem; have meanly bent Beneath injurious Henry's lordly Pride, And heard my Prayers rejected. ABBOT. Hapless Queen! Thy Wrongs, indeed, cry loud. QUEEN. My Son's torn from me. ABBOT. I've heard it all. QUEEN. And sat inactive down, To wait the slow Events of Time and Chance! ABBOT. Misdeem me not, great Queen; I have revolv'd Each Circumstance, with nicest Scrutiny; Ev'n from this Journey, which we wish'd to thwart. Much Good may be deriv'd; if the Prince breathe The Spirit of his Motherâ QUEEN. Peace! my Policy Hath flown before thee there; I have explor'd His active Spirit; found him what I hop'd: For me he sallies forth; for me returns, To vindicate my Rights. ABBOT. As we cou'd wish; And a sharp Spur, to forward his Designs In any daring Enterprize, is Leicester. By secret Emissaries I have learn'd, Within this Hour, that warm, ambitious Friend Withdraws from Court, and speeds to join the Prince In Normandy. QUEEN. But what avail these Views, Of distant Vengeance, to my present Pangs? Here I endure the Bitterness of Woe, While my curst Rival, bane of all my Joys, Dwells in Tranquility and soft Content; In placid Ease, within her Fairy-Bower, Enjoys my Henry's Smiles, his fond Endearments, And Vows of LoveâAh! due to me alone! ABBOT. That Dream shall vanish quickly. QUEEN. Say'st thou, Father? ABBOT. This very Evening, my religious Function Demands me at the Fair-one's Bower. QUEEN. The Fiend'sâ ABBOT. To thy sole Use the Time shall be employ'd. I will awaken in her tim'rous Mind The Dangers of her State; load her with Scruples; Then work her Temper to some dang'rous Scheme, That shall undo her Favour with the King. QUEEN. Its Nature?âSpeakâ ABBOT. Tax me not, gracious Mistress, To farther ExplanationâLet me have The Triumph and Delight to pour at once My subtle Scheme, and its desir'd Success, In thy enraptur'd Ear. QUEEN. Enoughâgo on, And give me this great Comfort; let me hear The Sorceress is sundered from his Arms; Work me this MiracleâRenown, and Wealth, Unbounded Power, and royal Patronage Shall be thy great Reward. [Exit. ABBOT. For Wealth and Power I on myself alone dependâVain Dreamer! Who weakly canst suppose I toil for thee. No, I have further, higher Views, beyond Thy feeble Stretch;âthe supple Rosamond Shall prove a greater Bane to thy Repose, Than thou divin'st; her will I instigate, With her soft Blandishments and witching Phrase, To practise on her Lover, till she lure him To cast thee from thy regal Dignities, Divorce thee from his Bed and Throne; that done, Th'Enchantress rises to the vacant Seat; Thus one great Point of my Desire is gain'd; Power uncontroulable awaits my Nod: The Gewgaw, dazzl'd with her Pomp, shall Rule the King, and I rule all, by ruling her. [Exit. SCENE changes to a Cloister. Enter CLIFFORD, dressed as an Abbot. CLIFFORD. Thou Garb, for holy Purposes design'd, Assist my honest Artifice; conceal My aged Form from Recollection's Trace, And be my Passport to my mourning Child, I'll hallow thee with Gratitude and Tears. This is the awful Hour, if right I learn, When in these solemn Isles the royal Henry Treads, Pilgrim-like, these Flints, and pours his Soul In Sighs for murder'd Recketâwhere, alas! Where are the deep Laments, the bitter Tears, Which he should shed for Clifford's ruin'd Peace? He comes, the great Disturber of my Breast: Ev'n noble in his Guilt!âmy Heart avows The fond Affection that I bore his Youth, And melts within me.âLet me shun his Sight A Moment, to retrieve my sinking Spirit. [Retires. Enter the KING, as a Pilgrim. KING. Must it be ever thus? still doom'd to tread This sullen Course, and for a bitter Foe? Becket, tho' in his Grave, torments me still. And what avails it him, who sleeps unconscious Of my forc'd Penance? Heart, resume thy Strength! Rouse thee! resist the bigot Imposition, And be thyself again. CLIFFORD. Who thus vents forth [Advancing. His sore Disquiets? KING. What is he who asks? If yon expiring Lamp deceive me not, Thy Garb betokens a religious Function. CLIFFORD. Thou judgest well. KING. Inform me, holy Guide, What boot the Punishments your Laws enjoin? Self-Castigation, balmy Sleep renounc'd, And lonely Wand'rings o'er the rugged Flint, Thro' the long-cloister'd Isle? CLIFFORD. Much, pious Stranger, Much they avail: within these silent Walls Chaste Contemplation dwells; this hallow'd Gloom Inspires religious Musings, ardent Prayer, Which, by their fervid Impulse, waft the Soul Of erring Man, above this Vale of Weakness, And teach him to regain, by heavenly Aid, What he had forfeited by human Frailty. KING. Divinely spoke! But well may'st thou declaim On their Utility, who ne'er hast felt Their harsh SeveritiesâThou haply canst Produce the Legend of a Life unstain'd. CLIFFORD. Noâwould to Heaven I had that Boast; but rank'd 'Mongst Error's Sons, I share the general Lot. Too numerous are my Faults; but one, alas! Beyond the rest I mournâSpare me a Moment, While I give Respite to my swelling Grief. KING. Methinks thou hast involv'd me in a Share Of thy Distress. For what art thou enjoin'd This rigid Duty, similar to mine? Who hath inflicted it? CLIFFORD. Myselfâmy Conscience. KING. Thyself! CLIFFORD. The Mind that feels its own Demerits, Needs no Infliction from another's Tongue. KING. My Ears, my Soul, are open to thy Wordsâ Give me to know thy Crime. CLIFFORD. How can I utter it, And not sink down with Shame? KING. Let Shame betide The coward Heart that will not own its Frailties; If there's a Grace in Man superior far To all beside, it must be that true Pride, That bids him speak his own Misdeeds. Proceed. CLIFFORD. I had a Friendâthe Darling of my Soulâ He lov'd, he honour'd meâthe Trade of War He taught my Youth; in many a hardy Field Have we together fought, asserted England's And noble Henry's Fame, Henry, the greatest, The best of Kings!â KING. Oh, painful Recollection! [Aside. Thou once hadst such a Friend, ungrateful Henry! CLIFFORD. A Length of Brotherhood we 'joy'd together, Till all its Blessedness was spoil'd by me. He had a Daughter, beauteous as the Eye Of Fancy ere imagin'dâ KING. Spare me, spare meâ Oh, bitter Tale! thou hadst a Daughter, Clifford! [Aside. CLIFFORD. I mark'd her for my own; pour'd the false Tale Of wily Love into her credulous Ear, And won her artless Heart. KING Tumultuous Pangs [Aside. Rush like a Torrent thro' my bursting Breast;â My Crime, reflected by this Stranger's Tale, Glares frightful on me! Till this Hour, I knew not My Trespass was so greatâOh, with what weak, What partial Eyes we view our own Misdeeds! The Faults of others are a huge Olympus, Our own an Emmet's Nest. CLIFFORD. Heart, Heart, be strong! [Aside. He muses deeply on itâI have hurt [To the King. Thy soft Humanity, I fear.âPerchance Thou hast a Daughter, who, like this my Victim, Hath stray'd from Virtue's Path. KING. Away, Awayâ I can endure no moreâO Conscience, Conscience, [Aside. With what a wild Variety of Torments Thou rushest thro' my Soul!â'Tis all Distraction, And asks some more than human Strength of Reason, To save me from Despair. [Exit. CLIFFORD. Kind Heaven, I thank thee; His noble Nature is not quite extinguish'd, He's wounded deepâOh! may he but retain This Sense of the sore Pangs he brought on me, Till I have rescu'd my repentant Child, And all my Bus'ness in this Life is done. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE, an Apartment in the Bower. ROSAMOND discovered writing. ETHELINDA attending. ROSAMOND. It is in vainâmy trembling Hands deny Their wonted Officeâmy distracted Mind Revolves a thousand Projects to regain Its vanish'd Peace; yet all by Turns evade My feeble Efforts; like the lucid Vapours, Which rise successive in a Summer's Sky, And court our Observation, yet are lost, Ere Fancy can assign them Name or Shape, Lost in the wide Expanse. Ah me! how weak, How insufficient to its own Desires, Is the poor Breast which Honour hath deserted! ETHELINDA. Say, is it ought thy Servant can discharge? She wishes to relieve thy Woe, and shares Thy every Pang. ROSAMOND. Thy sympathizing Heart Hath oft consol'd me, soften'd the rude Hour Of bitter Recollection, and repell'd Encroaching AgonyâMy Henry gave thee A Servant to my Use; but thy mild Nature, So ill adapted to the lowly State Wherein thy Lot was cast, taught me to change That servile Title for the Name of Friend. ETHELINDA. Give me that Office now, and let me speak Thy Meanings there. ROSAMOND. I know not what I mean. In vain, alas! she strives to please herself, Who hath offended Virtue. On that Paper I wish'd to pour my Duty to my Father, Implore his dear Forgiveness, beg one Blessing, Ere yet he sleep in PeaceâOh, Rosamond! Well hast thou spoke! for in the Grave alone Can Clifford rest.âPeace and Repose on Earth Thine impious Offences have deny'd him. Ere this, perhaps, he is laid low in Dust, And his last Hours were charg'd with Grief and Shame. ETHELINDA. Hope better, my fair Mistress; raise thy Thoughts From the dark Musings of despondent Woe, To these bright Scenes of Happiness and Joy. ROSAMOND. I have no Title to them; these bright Scenes May give Delight to unpolluted Breasts, But not to mine! The Charmer, Happiness, Hath long deserted me; with her lov'd Mate, Seraphic Innocence, she wing'd her Flight, I fear, for ever.âThis retir'd Abode, Grac'd with each Ornament inventive Fancy Can furnish, to allure th'admiring Eye, Serves but to sting me deeper with Remorse; Upon my Cheek imprint a stronger Glow Of conscious Shame, reflecting on the Cause, The wretched Cause, that brought me to their View. ETHELINDA. These are the Dictates of deforming Spleen, That to the low dejected Mind presents False and disgustful Objects. Henry's Absence Is the sad Source that casts this mournful Gloom On all around: three Days have now elaps'd Unmark'd by him and Love; when he arrives, The Bow'r, the Groves, will wear a fairer Aspect, And all be dress'd in Beauty and Delight. ROSAMOND. 'Tis true, I try to wear the Smile of Joy In my dear Conqueror's Sight: Nay, I do wear it; My Heart acknowledges the soft Delight His Presence gives. Had I not lov'd too well, I had not been this Wretch!âMy Soul doats on him! I live but in his Looks. Why was he not By Fate ordain'd some rustic Villager, And I the Mistress of a neighbour Cot, That we had met, as happy Equals do, And liv'd in Pleasures unallay'd by Guilt! ETHELINDA. Yet to engage the dear, the tender Hours, Which royal Henry spares from public Toils; To call that Heart your own, which all agree To love and honour; feast upon those Smiles, Which millions sigh forâ ROSAMOND. Cease, my Ethelinda; Thou know'st not how thy Words afflict my Breast. Think not, tho' fall'n from Innocence, my Mind Is callous to the Feelings of Humanity, Of Truth, or Justice. I reflect full oft, Ev'n in my happiest Moments, there lives One Who has a Right to Henry's ev'ry Hour, Each tender Vow, and each attractive Smile: I know it, and condemn my feeble Heart, For yielding to Desires all moral Laws Forbid, and in-born Reason disapproves. ETHELINDA. You school yourself too harshly. ROSAMOND. Oh, not so! I have much more to bear. I have not yet Learn'd the great Duty Expiation claims: To part, my Ethelinda. ETHELINDA. Part! from whom? ROSAMOND. From Henryâfrom the Monarch of my Heart; My Wishes' Lord, my All of earthly Bliss! Thou marvel'st at my Wordsâbut it must be; It is the sole Attonement I can make To a fond Father's Woes, his injur'd Fame, The tarnish'd Glories of a noble Line, The royal Eleanor's insulted Rights, And my own conscious, self-arraigning Heart. ETHELINDA. Oh! do not flatter that fond Heart with Hope Of such exertive Power! Beneath the Trial, Your Strength would fail, your Resolution droop; You cou'd not yield him up. ROSAMOND. By my warm Hopes Of mild Remission to my great Offences, I feel my Bosom equal to the Task, Hard as it is; so Henry left me not In Anger or Unkindness, but resign'd me, With the dear Care of a protecting Friend, To the soft Paths of Penitence and Peace, I would embrace the Torment it entail'd, And bless him for each Pang. ETHELINDA. Behold he comes! [Exit. Enter the KING. KING. My Rosamond! my ever new Delight! Receive me to thy Arms, enfold me there, Where ever-blooming Sweets perpetual rise, And lull my Cares to Rest. ROSAMOND. It was not thus My Henry us'd to visit this Retreat; Bright Chearfulness was wont to dance around him, Complacent Sweetness sat upon his Brow, And soft Content beam'd lovely from his Eye. KING. Well thou reprov'st me; I will strive to chace The gloomy Cloud, that overhangs my Spirit, Th'Effect of public Business, public Cares. (My Tell-Tale Looks, I fear, will speak the Pain My Heart still suffers, from that Stranger's Converse.) [Aside. Oft do I mourn the Duties of my Station, That call my Thoughts to them, and claim the Hours, Which I would dedicate to Love and thee. ROSAMOND. I meant not to reproach thee; 'twas my Zeal, For the dear Quiet of thy Mind, that spoke. I cannot see the slightest Shade of Grief Dim the bright Lustre of thy chearing Eye, But Apprehension pains me, lest for me Thy Glory be diminish'd to the World. KING. I seek not empty popular Acclaims; Thy tender Accents falling on mine Ear, Like rural Warblings on the panting Breeze, Convey more Rapture, more supreme Delight, Than Io-PÃ¦ans of a shouting World. ROSAMOND. To see bright Satisfaction glow within Thy manly Cheek, behold the rising Smile, And hear thee speak the Gladness of thy Heart, Is my best Joy, my Triumph, and my Pride; And yet, my Henry, ought it to be so? Still should I listen to the Syren, Pleasure, While awful Virtue lifts her sober Voice, And warns my Heart of her neglected Precepts? KING. Forbear, forbear these soft Complaints, and speak Of Rapture; speak of my improving Ardour, And thy unceasing Love. ROSAMOND. Oh! thou divin'st not How many heavy Hours, and sleepless Nights, Thy Rose endures! how much my faulty State (Bless'd as I am in thee) arraigns my Mind; Oft in the bitter Hours when thou art absent, My Father's Image rises to my View, Array'd in gloomy Grief, and stern Reproof. Nay, do not eye me with that melting Fondness; Hast thou not often bade me cast my Cares On thee, and told me, thou wou'dst bear them for me? Hear then, oh, hear me! for to whom but thee Can I unload my Heart? KING. Oh, speak not thus. Shou'd these sad Accents stain the precious Moments, When Henry flies from a tumultuous World To tranquil Joys, to Happiness, and thee? What busy Fiend, invidious to our Loves, Torments thy gentle Breast? ROSAMOND. Trust me, my Henry, This is no sudden Gust of wayward Temper, 'Tis Reason's Impulse; oft hath my Heart endur'd Afflictive Pangs, when my unclouded Face Hath worn a forc'd and temporary Smile, Because I would not hurt thy noble Mind. Advancing Time but multiplies my Torments, And gives them double Strength; they will have Vent. Oh! my Protector, make one glorious Effort Worthy thyselfâremove me from thy Arms; Yield me to Solitude's repentant Shade. KING. Renounce thee, didst thou say! my Rosamond! Were those the Words of her and Love? ROSAMOND. They were; It is my Love intreats; that Love which owns Thee for its first, its lust, its only Lord. Allow me to indulge it, undisturb'd By the sore Miseries which now surround me, Without the Sense of Guilt, that Fiend who waits On all my Actions, on my every Thought. KING. By Heaven, I never knew Distress till now! Thy Accents cleave my Soul; thou dost not know What complicated Agonies and Pangs Thy Cruelty prepares for Henry's Heart! He must endure a Throe, like that which rends The seated Earth, ere he can summon Strength To banish thee for ever from his Arms. ROSAMOND. Think, Conscience; Honour, plead. KING. Down, busy Fiend; [Aside. That Stranger's Tale, and Clifford's crying Wrongs, Distract my tortur'd Mindâin Pity ceaseâ [To Ros. I cannot part with thee. ROSAMOND. A thousand Motives Urge thy Complianceâwill not public Claims Soon call thee from thy Realm? When thou art gone. Who shall protect me? Who shall then provide A safe Asylum for thy Rosamond, To guard her Weakness from assailing Fears, And threat'ning Dangers? KING. What can here alarm thee? ROSAMOND. Perpetual Apprehensions rise; perchance The poignant Sense, how much my Crimes deserve, Adds to the Phantoms; Conscience-stung I dread I know not what of Ill. Remove me hence, My dearest Lord; thus on my Knees I sue, And my last Breath shall bless thee. Give me Misery, But rescue me from Guilt. KING. What, lead thee forth From these once happy Walls; yield thee, abandon'd, To an unpitying, unprotecting World! Then turn, and roam uncomfortably round The chang'd Abode, explore in vain the Bliss It once afforded; like a restless Sprite That hourly haunts the desolated Spot Where all his Treasure lay! Bid me tear out This seated Heart, and rend each vital String, I sooner could obey thee. [Going. ROSAMOND. Turn, my Henry; Leave me not thus in Sorrow! Canst thou part In Anger from me? KING. Anger!âOh! thou sweet one! Witness these Pangs!âI cannot, will not lose theeâ ROSAMOND. Confirm my Pardon then; pitying, reflect 'Tis the first Hour I e'er beheld thy Frown. Forgive meâoh, forgive me! KING. Spare meâspare A Moment's Thought to my distracted Soul, To ease the Throbs, and hush the swelling Tumults, Which my fond Love would fain conceal from thee, Thou exquisite Tormentor! [Exit. ROSAMOND. Heav'n sooth thy suff'ring Mind, restore thy Peace, And win thy yielding Spirit to my Prayer! For it must beâthe Blow must be endur'd, Tho' Nature tremble at itâHeav'n requires it: I hear the sacred Voice that claims aloud Attonement for its violated Laws. When I am sunder'd from him, ne'er again To feast my Eyes on his lov'd Form, or share His Converse more, it will be then no Sin, Nor Heav'n nor Man can be offended then, If sometimes I devote a pensive Hour To dwell upon his Virtues; or, at Night, When Sleep, like a false Friend, denies his Comforts, I bathe my solitary Couch with Tears, And weary Heav'n for Blessings on his Head. Enter the ABBOT. ABBOT. Health to the Fair, whose radiant Charms diffuse Bright Beams around, and shame meridian Day With rival Lustre and superior Beauty! ROSAMOND. Alas, good Father, my dejected Heart, Ill-suited now to Flattery's soothing Breath, Is wrapp'd in other Thoughts. ABBOT. An old Man's Praise Is of small Worth; nor shou'dst thou term it Flatt'ry, The Approbation which the ready Tongue Spontaneous utters at thy Beauties Sight: But thy sad Eyes are swoln with Tears, I trust They flow from holy Motives. ROSAMOND. Thou hast oft Preach'd, in persuasive Accents, the great Duty Of combating Temptation; teaching Virtue To gain Dominion o'er assailing Passions, And with her pious Firmness guard the Breast. ABBOT. I have, fair Daughter. ROSAMOND. These thy holy Precepts, My melancholy Heart, I hope, hath learn'd; The self-convicted Mourner hath resolv'd To turn from Guilt's delusive dang'rous Way, And seek the penitential Paths of Peace. ABBOT. Explain thyself, my Pupil; lay thy Meanings Clear to my View. ROSAMOND. I have resolv'd to leave This Culprit-State of unchaste, lawless Love, And, in some Solitude's protecting Shade! Attone, by future Purity of Life, My Errors past. ABBOT. 'Tis nobly purpos'd, Daughter; Worthy the Precepts I have given thy Youth, And the great Efforts of exalted Virtue: But why retire to moaping Solitude? The Heart is weak that finds itself unable In any Situation to repent Its past Misdeeds; it is the Principle, And not the Place, attones; we may be good, And yet abide in active, chearful Life; There are a thousand Pleasures and Delights Not inconsistent with the strictest Truth And Sanctity of Mind. ROSAMOND. It may be so, And such may be indulg'd by those whose Lives Have ne'er been branded with a flagrant Crime; But Wretches like myself, whom Conscience taxes, With violated Chastity and Justice, Have forfeited those Rights. ABBOT. I like not thisâ She dares debateâShe judges for herselfâ I must restrain this Freedomâ'tis Presumption. [Aside. ROSAMOND. Yes, all shall be renounc'd, all that conspir'd To make my guilty Situation wear The Face of Bliss; Splendor and Affluence, All shall be given up, and well exchang'd, If they obtain Remission for my Crimes. ABBOT. Some farther Meaning lurks beneath these Words, Which my foreboding Fears dislike. [Aside. ROSAMOND. My Henry I have solicited to this great Purpose, Of my new-open'd, new enkindled Mind. ABBOT. As I divin'dâDestruction to my Views! [Aside. ROSAMOND. Why turn'st thou from me? Breathe thy pious Comforts To nourish my Resolves. ABBOT. Think'st thou, fond Pupil, Thy Paramour will yield to thy Request? Oh no! his Passion is too much his Master. Think'st thou, can he who doats upon thy Beauties, Doats even to Follyâ ROSAMOND. Spare me, holy Fatherâ Wound not my Ear with one contemptuous Word Against his Dignity: I cannot bear it. ABBOT. My Recollection, zealous for thy Ease, Recalls the casual Word. I grieve to see thee Misled by Phantoms: but there is a Way, A clear and certain Way to Happiness, Which thou hast not descry'd. ROSAMOND. Inform me, Father, How I may compass the religious Ends My State demands, and my whole Soul aspires to, Without disquieting my Henry's Peace, And I will bless thee for it. ABBOT. Love alone Confers true Honour on the Marriage-State. Without this Sanction of united Hearts, The sacred Bond of Wedlock is defil'd, And all its holy Purposes o'erthrown. ROSAMOND. Be plain, good Father. ABBOT. Happiness should crown The Altar's Ritesâand Henry sure deserves To be supremely happyâthou alone Canst make him so. Need I say more? ROSAMOND. Speak on. Clear unambiguous Phrases best befit My simple Sense. ABBOT. His Union with the Queen Cannot be term'd a Marriage; Heav'n disdains The prostituted Bond, where hourly Jars Pervert the bless'd Intent; thy vain Retirement What boots it Eleanor? who now retains The Name alone of Queen; or what avails The Title of a Wife? Thou art th'espous'd Of his Affections; let the Church then shed Her holy Sanction on your plighted Loves; A pious Duty calls, assert thy Claim, Let thy fond Lord divorce her from her State, And Rosamond shall mount the vacant Throne. ROSAMOND. Thy specious Arguments delude me not; My Soul revolts against them. Hence, I scorn Thy further SpeechâHave I not Crimes enough? Have I not amply injur'd Henry's Wife, But I must further swell the guilty Sum? Fly with thy wicked, thy pernicious Schemes, To Breasts whence every Trace of Good is banish'd. I am not yet so vile; 'twas Henry's Self I lov'd, not England's King; not for the Wealth Of Worlds, for all that Grandeur can afford, The Pride of Dignity, the Pomp of Power, Nor even to fix my Henry mine alone, Will I advance one added Step in Sin, Or plant another Torment in her Breast, Whom too severely I have wrong'd already. [Exit. ABBOT. Bane to this coward Heart, that shrunk beneath The peevish Outrage of a frantic Girl! The vain Presumer sorely shall repent Her bold licentious Pride, that dar'd oppose Her upstart Insolence 'gainst my Controul, Whose Bidding shou'd direct her ev'ry Thought. Had she obey'd, the doting King perchance Had rais'd the painted Moppet to his Throne, And by that Deed, had lost his People's Love; A ready Victim to the daring Bands That threaten him around. That Hope is lostâ New Schemes must be devis'dâall Arts employ'd; For nothing shall appease my fierce Resentment, Till the foul Wounds giv'n to our mitred Saint, Be deep aveng'd in Henry's impious Heart. [Exit. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE the Palace. The ABBOT alone. ABBOT. It shall be soâthe Queen herself shall be My Instrument of Vengeance, both on Henry, And that audacious Minion, who presum'd To disobey my Dictates. This new Project Cannot deceive my Hopes: The haughty Eleanor, Fir'd by those Demons, Jealousy and Anger, Will set no Bounds to her outrageous Will, And she hath suffer'd Wrongs that might inflame A colder Breast. But why recoils my Heart At Thought of Harm to this presumptuous Wanton? Why feel reluctant Strugglings, as if Virtue Check'd and condemn'd my Purpose? 'Tis not Harm; 'Tis Piety, 'tis Mercy.âWill she not Be taken from a Life of Sin and Shame, And plac'd where she at Leisure may repent Her great Offences? This is giving her Her Soul's Desire.âBut Eleanor, not I, Shall be the Means. Night gathers round apace: Ascend, thick Gloom, and with thy sable Wings Veil Henry's Peace for ever from his Eyes! Enter QUEEN. Hail, honour'd Queen! QUEEN. Art thou a Comforter? Thine Order calls thee such; but thou approachest Unlike the Messenger of gladsome Tidings: Delay is in thy Step, and Disappointment Sits on thy Brow. ABBOT. Oh, skilful in the Lines Which the Mind pictures on th'obedient Visage, To speak her inward Workings! QUEEN. Thy Designs Have fail'd? ABBOT. To thee I yield the Palm of Wisdom, Effective Policy, and deep Contrivance; To thee resign it all. QUEEN. Lose not the Moments In vain Lamentings o'er Mischances past: One Project foil'd, another should be try'd, And former Disappointments brace the Mind For future Efforts, and sublimer Darings. ABBOT. Thy noble Spirit may perchance succeed Where all my Arts have fail'd. I boast no Power O'er this perverse, this self-directed Wanton; She seems new-fram'dâher gentle Disposition, Which erst was passive to Instruction's Breath, As vernal Buds to Zephyr's soothing Gale, Is banish'd from her Breast; imperious Tones Exalt her Voice, and Passion warms her Cheek. QUEEN. Whence can it spring, this new presumptuous Change? Can she assume the Port of Arrogance? She, whose soft Looks and hypocritic Meekness Have won admiring Eyes and pitying Tongues, While I am tax'd with warm and wayward Temper, For that I have not Meanness to conceal A just Resentment for atrocious Wrongs, But bid them glow within my crimson Cheek, And flash indignant from my threat'ning Eye. ABBOT. The Lures of Greatness, and Ambition's Baits, Are eagerly pursu'd by soaring Minds: When first their Splendor is display'd before them, Anticipating Hope exalts their Brightness, And fires the wretched Gazer, ev'n to Frenzy. QUEEN. What Hopeâwhat Greatnessâwhat Ambition? Speak! Explain thy Meaning, ease the gath'ring Tumult That struggles here, and choaks me with its Fullness. ABBOT. I fear to speak. QUEEN. Why fear? Look on me well; I am a Woman with a Hero's Heart. Be quickâbe plainâthou hast no Tale t'unfold Can make me shudderâtho' it make me feel. ABBOT. Her wild Imagination hurries her Beyond Belief, or ev'n Conception's Limit; Safely protected by the royal Favour Of her great Master (may I say his Love?) QUEEN. On with thy SpeechâDispatch! ABBOT. She threats Defiance To every other Power, and all Controul: Bids me, with haughty Phrase, no more assume The Right to check her Deeds; exalts herself Above the Peers and Worthies of the Realm: Nay, frantic in her fancied Excellence, Becomes thy Rival in imperial Rule, And plumes herself on future Majesty. QUEEN. The Traitress! but thou err'st, it cannot be: Thou hast mista'en her Words; her coward Heart Cou'd not conceive such Insolence of Speech, Such arrogant Presuming. ABBOT. In Effect All was express'd, tho' not in open Terms; Hearts so determin'd rarely speak their Meaning, Lest just Prevention intercept their Purpose: But thus much, in the Fullness of her Passion, Fell from her Lips: Let her a while enjoy (These were her Words) her transitory Greatness! Anon the Beam may take a different Poise; The Mistress may become th'exalted Wife, The haughty Wife become th'abandon'd Mistress. QUEEN. Breath'd she those daring, those audacious Accents, And doth the Wretch survive it? Be it so! She only lives to gratify my Vengeance. Ere the vain Dreamer mount her airy Throne, She shall be taught the Power of Royalty O'er her own Littleness, her Pigmy Pride. ABBOT. You do not mean to see her? QUEEN. YesâI doâ She thirsts for Honour; I will shew it her; Will deign to set before her shrinking View Majestic Eleanor, th'exalted Wife, And with a Glance destroy her. ABBOT. All you seek May be obtain'd by this great Condescension: Within your Power, beneath your Eye abash'd, Whelm'd with her Crimes, and shrinking in her Fears, She'll crouch to any Terms; bind her by Oath No more to see your Lord; or if you doubt The Efficacy of that Tye, remove her From the gay Bower her Infamy hath stain'd. Perform a holy Work; force her to quit The wanton Course of her abandon'd Life, And in some dim, secure Retreat, where you Alone command, conceal the Sorceress For ever from the godlike Henry's Eyes. QUEEN. Oh, precious Doctrine! learned Comforter! Continue thus to counsel; leave my Heart, My dauntless Heart, to execute thy Schemes. ABBOT. When mean youâ QUEEN. Now; this Nightâmy eager Fury Brooks no DelayâThou must advise the Hour. ABBOT. About the Season when imperial Henry Speeds to his Midnight Penance at the Convent, I will with nicest Caution watch the Momentsâ QUEEN. And be my Guide? ABBOT. Devoted to your Bidding. QUEEN. But softâthe Means of our Accessâdid not This grand Apostate to his nuptial Bond, Contrive some childish Toy, some subtle Clue, Without whose Aid Enquiry's Foot in vain Attempts to find the Wanton's close Retreat? ABBOT. He did; but that Device is only practis'd When public Duties call him from his Realm; Then is the Minion deep immur'd within The very Heart of the obscure Recess; But now that he with frequent Eye o'erlooks And watches his cag'd Turtle, she enjoys Free Range of the whole Bower, by few attended, And none but who submissive yield Obedience To our grave Habit and religious Order. QUEEN. Enough, use wary Watchâand hye with Speed To my impatient Soul. [Exit Abbot. Conceal her! yes, In that deep Cavern, that eternal Gloom, Where all her Shames may be conceal'dâin Death; Atonement less than this were insufficient To gratify my boundless Thirst of Vengeance. Long have they revell'd in the mighty Pangs That rent my Heartâ'tis now my Turn to Triumph, When I behold the Traitor sunk in Grief, Plaining to her whose Bosom will be cold To his Distress, superior will I rise, Proudly exult in his severest Pangs, Point at her lifeless Corse, for whom he scorn'd me, And loud exclaim in his afflicted Ear, Behold the Victim of Despair and Love. [Exit. SCENE, an Apartment in the Bower. Enter ROSAMOND with a Letter, and ETHELINDA. ROSAMOND. No, EthelindaâNever from that Hour, That fatal Hour when first I saw my Hero, Saw him returning from the Field of War, In manly Beauty, flush'd with glorious Conquest, Till our last grievous Interview, did Henry Shew Word or Look ungentleâNay, even now, Here in the full Distraction of his Soul, O'er his strong Woes soft Tenderness prevails, And all the Fondness of unbounded Love. ETHELINDA. But what does he resolve? ROSAMOND. There Ethelinda, He gives me fresh Disquiet, Frenzy seems To guide his wayward Pen; he talks of Life As of a Load he wishes to lay down, If I persist in my unnatural Purpose, For such he terms it. Canst thou think, my Henry, I suffer not Affliction great as thine? Yes, let the present Tumults in my Breast Be Witness how I struggle with Affection, Stand up and war with Nature's strongest Power, In Duty and Religion's righteous Cause ETHELINDA. And must your Gentleness abide such Trials, Such hard Extremity of Wretchedness? Is there no middle Course to steer? ROSAMOND. Forbear! Seek not to tempt me from that proper Sense Of my deep Faults, which only can sustain me In this sore Trial; to remit my Fervour, Were to be lost again. ETHELINDA. He'll ne'er Consent To yield you up, resign you to your Woe, Unfriended, unsustain'd, to heave alone The bitter Sigh and pour th'unpitied Tear. ROSAMOND. He says he will return to me, and soon; Then paints the Anguish of his bleeding Heart, In unconnected Phrase and broken Periods; Adjures me, by our Loves, no more to urge The hard Request on which his Life depends. Oh, did I ever think I could refuse What Henry ask'dâbut thisâIt must not beâ Lend me thy Arm, my Friend, a sudden Faintness Comes o'er me, and instinctive Boadings whisper I shall not long survive my Henry's Loss. ETHELINDA. Oh, chide them from you! at the sad Idea My Sorrows stream afresh. ROSAMOND. Weep not for that, 'Tis my best Comfort. In the Grave alone Can I find true Repose, that quiet Haven, Whereto the wretched Voyager in Life, Whose little helpless Bark long Time hath strove 'Gainst the rude Beatings of tumultuous Guilt, Oft casts an ardent Look, an eager Wish, To gain a Shelter there from future Storms. ETHELINDA. Let me conduct thee to the cheering Breeze, Thy Looks are pale. ROSAMOND. Oh thou, that art all Mercy, [Kneels. Look down, indulgent, on the Child of Frailty; With Pity view her Errors, and instruct her How to obtain returning Peace and Pardon. Enter CLIFFORD in his Disguise. CLIFFORD. Stay thee, fair Mourner, wherefore dost thou shun The Messenger of Comfort? ROSAMOND. Ethelinda! What Voice was that? My startled Fancy wakes New Terrors! Yet it cannot beâ CLIFFORD. My Daughter!â ROSAMOND. All gracious Heaven! 'tis heâ [Faints. CLIFFORD. Oh, let me clasp her To a fond Father's aged Breast, and call Her sinking Spirit from the Shades of Death. ETHELINDA. Oh, reverend Stranger, if thou be'st her Father, With gentle Voice allure her; do not cast The Frown of Anger on her meek Distress, Her Softness cannot bear it. CLIFFORD. Fear not, Virgin! Assist to raise herâthe returning Blood Faintly renews its Course! her timid Eye Speaks painful Apprehension. ROSAMOND. Where is fled, That rev'rend Form? even now it hover'd o'er me, Sent by kind Heav'n, the sacred Delegate Of Comfort and Protection. CLIFFORD. Rosamond! Oh! turn not from meâdo not shun my Sight, In Pity shrink not from a Father's Eye, Who comes to chace thy Sorrows; comes to shed Some pious Drops o'er thy afflicted Heart, Ere he is mingled with the Dust. ROSAMOND. Thus lowly Bent to the Earth, with abject Eye, that dares not Look up to that much injur'd rev'rend Face, Let me implore thy Pardon. CLIFFORD. Rise, my Child, Oh rise and let me gaze on that lov'd Form, Which once was all my Comfort. ROSAMOND. But which now You look upon with Anger and Disgust. My Crimes deserve it all. CLIFFORD. Nay, meet my Eyeâ Survey me well: Dost thou behold therein A rigid Judge? Oh no, the Father melts In these fast-streaming Tears. ROSAMOND. Has pitying Heaven Heard the sad Prayer of such a guilty Wretch, And granted, in the Moment of Affliction, A Parent's Presence, and returning Blessing, To his repentant Child! CLIFFORD. Dost thou repent?â And didst thou wish once more to see thy Father? Dry up thy Tears, and answer me with Firmness; Dost thou repent?âHast thou the Fortitude To break the fatal Tye that link'd thy Soul To lawless Love, and all its false Allurements? Canst thou look up, with steady Resolution, To that great Power who loves repentant Hearts, And say thou wilt no more transgress? ROSAMOND. I can, I can, my Father; that all-seeing Power, To whom thou hast appeal'd, can witness for me, I have renounc'd the Paths of Sin and Shame, And mean to spend my sad Remains of Life In deep Contrition for my past Offences. CLIFFORD. To find thee thus, is Rapture to my Soul! Enter my Breast, and take again Possession Of all the Fondness that I ever bore thee. By my best Hopes, when in thy smiling Youth Mine Eye hath hung enamour'd on thy Charms, Thou shew'dst not then so lovelily as now, Dress'd in those graceful penitential Tears. ROSAMOND. Oh, my Father! And may I still look up to thee with Hope That the dear Love and Tenderness, thy Breast Once cherish'd for thy darling Rosamond, Is not extinguish'd quite? CLIFFORD. Alas, my Child! I am not lost to Nature and her Ties. We are all frail; preach Stoicks how they will, 'Tis not a Parent's Duty to cast off, But to reclaim, the Wand'rer of his Blood. One Question more, on that depends my Peaceâ Shall I behold my Child redeem'd from Shame, Or must I sink with Sorrow to the Grave, Ere this great Bus'ness of my Soul's accomplish'd? ROSAMOND. Command my Heart; can I, thus lost to Goodness, Assuage thy Cares, and soften the Decline Of weary Nature? say, my dearest Father, And by the Zeal of my Obedience, prove The Truth of my Contrition. CLIFFORD. Hear me then, Thou darling of my Bosom!âWestward hence, On the slow Rising of a fertile Hill, A virtuous Dame, of honourable Race, Hath founded and endow'd a hallow'd Mansion To pure Devotion's Purposes assign'd. No Sound disturbs the Quiet of the Place, Save of the bleating Flocks and lowing Herds, And the meek Murmurs of the trilling Stream That flows sweet-winding thro' the Vale beneath; No Objects intercept the Gazer's Eye, But the neat Cots of neighb'ring Villagers, Whose lowly Roofs afford a pleasing Scene Of modest Resignation and Content. There Piety, enamour'd of the Spot, Resides; there she inspires her holy Fervour, Mild, not austere; such Piety, as looks With soft Compassion upon human Frailty, And sooths the Pilgrim-Sinner to embrace Repentant Peace beneath her holy Roof.â Say, wilt thou quit, for such serene Delights, This gay Abode of Shame? ROSAMOND. I will, my Father; My Wish invites to such a soft Retreat. Oh, lead me forth! CLIFFORD. Thy Words give added Strength To my weak Frame, and warm my languid Blood. Some two Hours hence, when Midnight veils the Globe, Disguis'd, as now, in this religious Garb, Again expect me, to redeem thee hence, And guide thy Steps to that Abode of Blissâ Here break we offâ ROSAMOND. Once more thy Blessing on me, While I pour forth the silent Gratitude Of my full Soul for thy returning Love. CLIFFORD. Warm as thy Soul can wish, my Child, receive it. Oh, the supreme Delight 'twill be, to see thee Restor'd to holy Peace and soft Content, And sometimes share thy Converse; then devote My lonely Intervals to ceaseless Prayer, That Heaven will pour on thy repentant Heart Its healing Mercy, and its promis'd Grace! [Exit. ROSAMOND. Propitious Power, who chear'st the Mourner's Spirit, Accept my boundless Thanksâthy pitying Goodness Inspir'd my Father's Heart, and sent him hither To succour and sustain me. Oh, continue Thy strength'ning Fervour, that I may not shrink From the great Task I have begun, but rise An Object worthy thy returning Grace! ETHELINDA. My gentle Mistress, I partake your Transport, Yet Apprehension checks the rising Joy. What Agonies will pierce your Henry's Heartâ ROSAMOND. Peace, on thy Life! seek not to wake again Those Thoughts which I must hush within my Breast; The Lover is forgot; what Clifford's Daughter Leaves unperform'd, Clifford himself will perfect. That Tongue, whose wholesome Counsels Henry wont, In early Life, to listen and obey. That Heart, which lov'd his Virtues, will again Exert its Power, and win him to applaud The Minister of Peace, who leads me hence To that Asylum my Offences claim. END OF THE FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE, the Bower. Enter ROSAMOND and ETHELINDA. ROSAMOND. Is it the vain Suggestion of my Fears, Or do unwonted Sounds, and buzzing Murmurs, Ride in each Breeze? ETHELINDA. 'Tis Fancy's Coinage all; Your Mind, alarm'd lest any thwart Event Should interrupt this Night's important Business, Creates false Terrors. ROSAMOND. Twice within this Hour Hath it presented to my tortur'd Sight My Father in the Agonies of Death, Gasping and pale, and stretching forth his Hands To me for Aid and Pity. ETHELINDA. When Suspense And Expectation hold Dominion o'er The agitated Bosom, these Illusions Are busy to torment us. ROSAMOND. Angels speed him In Safety to me! and console my Henry, When he shall seek his Rosamond in vain Around this once-lov'd Bower! When thou behold'st him, (O! can it be a Crime to leave a Sigh, One soft Adieu for him, who was so dear?) Say, Ethelinda, that I left these Walls Not with a harden'd, but a tutor'd Mind, Not desp'rate, but resolv'd; arm'd with that due, That holy Resolution, which becomes My State and Purpose; and when busy Memory Recalls the sad Idea of our Loves, (Too oft alas! I fear 'twill press my Mind!) I'll pour my fervent Pray'rs, that Bliss and Honour May crown the Hero's Days! ETHELINDA. I will do all My Mistress bids; but must I stay behind? Must I renounce the sweet Companionship, Her Gentleness and soft Humanity Have taught me to esteem my highest Bliss? ROSAMOND. This once, obeyâthis Night's great Business done, I claim no Duty more; but when the Storm Shall be o'er-blown, and all be calm again, If aught of Good befall my after-Hours, Thou, Ethelinda, shall partake it with me. Go now, collect together those dear Pledges, The only Treasure I shall carry hence, My Henry's Letters; my o'er-harrass'd Spirits Would sink beneath the Task. [Exit Ethel. Ill-boading Fears Possess me still; such as I oft have heard Haunt the sick Couch, Death's fable Harbingers. Enter QUEEN with a Bowl and Dagger. QUEEN. Ay, there the Trait'ress sits. Who could surmize Guilt kept abode in such an Angel-Form? Approach, thou beauteous Fiend! Well mayst thou start, 'Tis Eleanor that calls; she comes to wake thee From the vain Dream, which thou hast long enjoy'd, To Justice and Atonement. ROSAMOND. Shield me, Powers, From that wrong'd Form! My Fears are all explain'd! QUEEN. No Pow'r can shield thee nowâThy Pray'rs are fruitless; Now cry in vain to him who hath undone thee, Who robb'd thee of thy Innocence of Heart, And taught thee to be Rival to a Queen. ROSAMOND. Most injur'd Majesty, thus to the Earth I bow myself before thee. I confess My heinous Crimes; I sink beneath their Weight: Yet Oh! take Pity on a hapless Creature Misled by fatal Love, immers'd in Guilt, And blinded to the Evils that ensued! QUEEN. And plead'st thou that in thy Defence, fond Wretch, Which loudest cries against thee? Knew'st thou not Who Henry was, what were his noble Ties? How did thy Passion dare aspire so high? Thou should'st have sought within thine own Degree Mates for thy wanton Hours; then hadst thou not Debas'd a Monarch in his People's Eyes, Nor wak'd the Vengeance of an injur'd Queen. ROSAMOND. Alas, thou look'st on me as on a Wretch Familiar with Pollution, reconcil'd To harden'd Guilt, and all its shameless Arts; I am not such. Night's holy Lamps can witness What painful Sighs my sad afflicted Heart Hath heav'd, what streaming Tears my Eyes have pour'd, To be releas'd from the pernicious Snare Wherein I was involv'd! QUEEN. Those Sighs and Tears, Had true Contrition been their holy Source, Should have inspir'd thy Heart to break the Snare, And set itself at Freedom. ROSAMOND. O! 'tis true They should; but in my rebel Breast they found Too strong Resistance. Love hath been my Fault, My Bane, my Ruin; long he held entranc'd My fascinated Senseâ O let this very Weakness plead my Cause Within your royal Breast; revolve, great Queen, How you have lov'd, and let those tender Feelings Win you to pity me! QUEEN, Aside. What Witchery Of Language hangs upon this Circe's Tongue? Why droops my Resolution? rouse thee, Eleanor, Remember the great Cause that brought thee hither, Nor let a Harlot's Sigh, or treach'rous Tear, Relax thy Fortitude. ROSAMOND. What shall I do To humble me yet lower in thy Sight? What Form of Language shall my Lips adopt To move thy Mercy? I confess my Crimes, Confess their Heinousness, and sue for Pardon: Can I do more? Ev'n Heav'n is won by Tears, By contrite Heart, and fervent Supplication; Shalt thou be harder to appeaseâO hear! A Woman's Weakness claims a Woman's Pity. Exert that Dignity of Soul that rises Above Resentment to a pleaded Wrong, And teach me how to make Atonement. QUEEN. Hence! [Aside. Encroaching Weakness! coward Heart, abjure itâ Think on thy mighty WrongsâArm thee to meet My Words with noble Firmness! Death alone, Appeases Eleanor's insulted Love. ROSAMOND. Death, saidst thou?âDeath!âO yetâ QUEEN. Behold, Deluder! I will not stain me in thy Blood; this Cup Contains thy Doom. ROSAMOND. Oh! do not bid me die, Steep'd as I am in Guilt; clos'd in a Convent, Where Heav'n's clear Air and animating Light Ne'er fond an Entrance, let me be condemn'd To all the Hardships ever yet devis'd; Or banish me to roam far-distant Realms, Unfriendly Climates, and unsocial Wastes, So thou afford me some remaining Hours To reconcile my Soul to that great Summons, When Heav'n shall to deign to call. QUEEN. Prophane no more The Name of Heav'n with thy polluted Breath, Thou who hast spurn'd its Laws! Justice demands Thy forfeit Life. Thou shalt no more mislead A Monarch's noble Mind, no more devise Insiduous Arts, to work a Queen's Disgrace: Thou shalt not live to rob her of her Rights, Her Lord's Affection, and imperial Pride, That thou mayst seize the abdicated Seat, And Triumph in her Fall. ROSAMOND. By Heav'n's pure Grace, My Mind ne'er harbour'd such an impious Thought! QUEEN. Heap not fresh Crimes, thou hast enough already. ROSAMOND. Have I no Evidence on this side Heaven? And must I fall alone, unjustified? Where is the holy Abbot? Where my Henry? QUEEN. Thy Henry! thine!âThat Word hath fir'd anew My failing Spirit. Drink! ROSAMOND. Yet, yet, relentâ QUEEN. Drink! or this Poniard searches ev'ry Veinâ ROSAMOND. Is there no Pity? None?âThis awful Silence Hath answer'd me, and I entreat no more. Some greater Pow'r than thine demands my Life; Fate summons me; I hear, and I obeyâ O, Heav'n! if Crimes like mine may hope Forgiveness, Accept a contrite Heart! [Drinks. QUEEN, O, beauteous Witch! Hadst thou been less alluring, or had I Forgot to Love, thou hadst not met this Fate. [Aside. ROSAMOND. Thou art obey'dâOnce more I bend before theeâ Nay harden not thy Heart to the last Accents Of a poor Wretch, that hurries to her Grave. Look, look upon me; I behold thee not With unforgiving and resentful Eyes; I deem thee but the destin'd Instrument Of righteous Heav'n, to punish my Misdeeds. QUEEN. A Flood of Agony o'erwhelms my Soul, And all my Pride and Rage is wash'd away [Aside. ROSAMOND. Now cast an Eye of Pity on my Tears, Now, in these awful, these tremendous Moments, Thou canst not doubt my Truth. By my warm Hopes Of Mercy at that Throne where all must bow, My only Crime was Love. No Pow'r on Earth Could have impell'd me to a further Wrong Against thy State or Peace. QUEEN. I must believe theeâ What then remains for me? O rise, and wreak Thy Vengeance on my now-relenting Rage. Behold these TearsâMy Wrongs are all forgotâ Excess of Passion, Love, that knew no Bounds, Drove me, with execrable Haste, to actâ What now I would resign all earthly Bliss To have undone again. KING, within. Seize all that haunt These winding Avenuesâlet none escape. ROSAMOND. Ah me! that Voice! QUEEN. 'Tis Henry'sâlet him come, And take his Share of Mis'ry. Enter the KING, ETHELINDA, and Attendants. KING. Where, where is she?â O fell, vindictive Fiend, what horrid Act Hath thy dark Rage been dealing? QUEEN. Mad Revenge! ETHELINDA. Lo! the dread Means! all this my Mind foretold, When the Queen's Train first met my startled Eye. ROSAMOND. Ev'n now my flitting Spirit is on the Wing; The deadly Draught runs thro' my scorching Blood, I feel it at my HeartâO! HenryâHenry!â KING. Malicious Rage, thou rid'st the Lightning's Flash To execute thy Vengeance! Ethelinda, Thy Zeal was cool, thy Expedition slow, Compar'd to that fell Tyrant's rapid Heat. Lift up thine EyesâO! do not leave me yetâ Why melts Compassion in thy languid Look? The Flames of Fury should be kindled there, 'Gainst him, who left thee to invading Fate, Who saw not thy Distress, heard not thy Cries, When black Revenge was pouring Torments on thee!â O cruel Woman, unrelenting Fiend!â ROSAMOND. Calm, calm thy Mind; vent not thy Fury there, Her Wrongs cried loud, and her great Heart is wrapt In Sorrow for the Deed. KING. What now avails it? Compunction should have sprang when she beheld The streaming Tears course one another down Thy beauteous Cheek, and read the speechless Grief Of thy imploring Eyes.âO! was it thus I thought to see my Rosamond again!â Hath Fury, like an Eastern-Blast, destroy'd The sweetest, loveliest Flow'r that ever bloom'd? But I will die beside thee; never more Revisit chearful Day, nor dream of Comfort, When thou art parted from me. ROSAMOND. Cease, O! cease These useless Plainings; consecrate to Peace The few remaining Momentsânor let Rage Impel thy Soul to meditate Revenge For a poor Wretch, who justly thus atones Her numerous Crimes. O, royal Eleanor! Hear these last AccentsâHowsoe'er I lov'd, However guilty I have seem'd to you, This very Night I had resolv'd to leave These fatal Walls, and, by my Father's Guidance, Devote my future Days to Penitence. KING. Doth not thy Blood, like mine, halt in thy Veins, And chill the Seat of Life? ROSAMOND. Extend thy Pity, (I cannot wrong thee further) grant me now One Moment to indulge the tender Feelings Of hapless Love, and breathe a fond Adieu, Ere this poor harrass'd Spirit quit my Breast. KING. Why this Compassion to the wretched Cause Of all thy Miseries! I am the Source Of ev'ry Pang, that feeds on thy lov'd Heartâ Of this thy fatal End.âReproach, revile meâ Do any thing but look thus kindly on me, And I will struggle with my mighty Woes, Taught by thy great Example. ROSAMOND. O, my Henry! Let not the sad Remembrance of my Fate Sit on thy Heart, nor call my present State A Misery; I wish'd some sure Retreat From Grief and Shame, and Heav'n hath heard my Prayer. QUEEN. Unhappy Victim of my blinded Fury, I almost envy thee thy present State; Thou soon wilt be at Ease; while I must live To all the Torments which a guilty Mind Inflicts upon itself. KING. Canst thou feel thus, Yet couldst remain obdurate to her Tears, And deaf to her Intreaties? QUEEN. A Deed like this Was foreign to my Heart, had not the Fraud Been pour'd into my Ears, that I was meant To be divorc'd for ever from thine Arms, Be made an Outcast from thy Bed and Throne, That she might rise my Substitute in all. KING. What black-soul'd DÃ¦mon could possess thy Mind With such a hellish Falshood? QUEEN. Heâthat Fiend! CLIFFORD brought on in his Disguise. KING. Wretch, take thy Death. ROSAMOND. Forbear! [Faints. CLIFFORD. Strike, Henry, strike! Why start'st thou back? I shrink not from the Blow; New Woes assail me at that sinking Object, And all thy Sword can do is Mercy now. KING. Thou, Night, in tenfold Darkness close me round, From that much-injur'd Form! CLIFFORD. My Child, my Child, Awake, and let me once more hear thy Voice. Speak, speak, my Rosamond; tell my sad Heart What further Woe awaits it. Hath Affliction Robb'd me of Sense, or do I see the Pangs Of ruthless Death within thy struggling Eye? ROSAMOND. Thou dost, my Father; let me bless thy Goodness, Ere Speech forsake me; thou art come to execute Thy pious PromiseâFate prevents thy Care, And I submit. My penitential Tears, My Hopes of heav'nly Mercy, and thy Pardon, Alleviate Death's sharp Terrors. CLIFFORD. O! what Hand Hath robb'd me of the latest Ray of Hope, That trembling glitter'd on my Eve of Life? QUEEN. In me behold the Murderer of thy Peace! Vent thy Reproaches, load me with thy Curses, I'll bear them all; high as I am in Rank, And proud in Heart, I bend to make Atonement. My Rage unsex'd me; and the dire Remembrance Will ever haunt my Mind. KING. It will have Vent. Lo, injur'd Clifford, Henry kneels before thee! Henry, who spurn'd the holy Ties of Friendship, The kindly Brotherhood of human Nature, And robb'd thee of thy Child; yet let me mingle My penitential with thy pious Tears O'er this lov'd Form, for whom my Heart weeps Blood. ROSAMOND. Peace, Peace, a Moment! let my parting Spirit Glide gently hence; Death hurries on apace. O! welcome! hide me in thy peaceful Breast From the dread Horrors that surround me here.â Confusion, Shame, oppress my languid Thoughts In this dread Moment.âYe, much-injur'd, pour Compassion on me now! Thou, royal Eleanorâ Thou best of FathersâO forgive!âAnd thou, Beloved Henry!âOh!â [Dies. KING. Art thou then gone?â And did thy dying Looks and Words speak Pardon To thy Destroyer? In that parting Sigh, The meekest, kindest Spirit took its Flight That ever held Abode in human Breast. O, sorrowing Clifford! how shall I atone Thy bleeding Injuries? CLIFFORD. It needs not, Henry; My Child lies dead before meâ'Tis enoughâ One Grave will hold us bothâMy failing Heart Had but few Drops of Life's warm Stream remaining, Grief soon will drink them allâ KING. What now can Fate do more? Rain, Eyes, rain everlasting Floods of Tears O'er this sad Monument of lawless Love. QUEEN. If thy torn Heart can spare from its own Anguish A Moment's Respite, hear! Thou know'st me, Henry; Was Cruelty an Inmate of this Breast, When thou wert kind and constant? Think what Pangs I must have felt, ere wrought to this black Deed; Let that Reflection win one pitying Tear For all my Suff'rings, and I ask no more. KING. It shall be so; and we will reign together In solemn, sad, uncomfortable Woe. QUEEN. No, Henry, no; the Hand that's foul with Murder, (Bear Witness, Heav'n!) shall ne'er be clos'd in thine. To the sad Cloister and repentant Prayer I give my future Life. Hail, gloomy Shades! Ye best befit the execrable Wretch, Who, daring to assume the Bolts of Vengeance, Dealt Desolation with unbounded Fury, And shew'd the Faults she meant to punish slight, Compar'd to her, and her atrocious Crimes. [Exit Queen. KING. In this great Deed thou hast out-gone thy Henry, Peace to thy troubled Soul! Ye hapless Pair, Accept these Tears, for ever will they flow, While Memory recalls this dreadful Scene. Here let the gay Seducer turn his Eyes, And see the dread Effects of lawless Love: Learn, 'tis no single Crime, the Mischief spreads To all the dearest Ties of social Life. Not only the deluded Virgin's Heart Falls the sad Victim of his trait'rous Art, But oft, a Prey to one licentious Deed, The Friend, the Lover, and the Parent bleed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE, Written by G. COLMAN, Esq. Spoken by Miss BARSANTI. Great and fair Ladies! Lords gallant and mighty! Behold a Femaleâfresh from Otaheite. Stretch to the Southern Ocean your Idea, And view, in me, the Princess Oberea. Full three long Hours I've sat, with smother'd Rage, To hear the Nonsense of your tragick Stage, To see a Queen majestically swagger, A Bowl in this Hand, and in this a Dagger; To stab or poison (cruel Inclination!) A Maid, who gave a Husband Consolation. Ah, Ladies! no such Queen at Otaheite; Love there has Rosesâwithout Thorns to fright ye; Frolick our Days, and to compleat our Joy, A Coterie's form'dâ'tis call'd the Arreoy, Where Love is free and general as the Air, And ev'ry Beau gallants with ev'ry Fair; No Ceremonies bind, no Rule controuls But Love, the only Tyrant of our Souls! But Pleasure's foreign to these Northern Climes, And Love, I hear, unknown in these dull Times: Never was Maiden in these Days caught tripping, Never was Wife on Pleasure's Ice found slipping: True to their Lords, to Gallantry ne'er prone, Divorces are so rare, the Name's scarce known. Yet in our Southern Airâat least I'm toldâ Nor French nor Englishmen were quite so cold; And, if your Poet of to-night say true, Love formerly warm'd British Ladies too; And Ladies of old Times perhaps might plead, That modern Ladies are the self-same Breed. There is a Place, I'm told, call'd Doctor's Commons, Whence Husbands issue to false Wives dread Summons; For each pretends, an all-sufficient Elf, To keep a Lady to his precious Self. Yet Man, proud Man, from Oberea know, That female Follies on your Follies grow; And all your Hopes of Constancy are vain, If Marriage binds not in a mutual Chain. If in cold Sheets ye leave poor Nell to sleep, And some fair Rose in Covent-Garden keep; Think of the Ills that wait domestic Strife, The heaviest Care of all the Cares of Lifeâ A tempting Mistress, and an angry Wife! For you, ye Fair, whom conscious Virtue arms, And with her Graces heightens Beauty's Charms, Hear a frail Sister on your Pity call, And save fair Rosamond a second Fall! FINIS.</field>
