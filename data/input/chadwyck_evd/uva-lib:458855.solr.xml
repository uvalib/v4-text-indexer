      <field name="fulltext">To the Reader. It hath been no custome in me of all other men (courteous Reader) to commit my Playes to the Presse: the reason though some may attribute to my owne insufficiency, I had rather subscribe, in that, to their seveare censure, then by seeking to avoyd the imputation of weakenesse, to incurre greater suspition of honesty: for though some have used a double sale of their labours, first to the Stage, and after to the Presse: For my owne part, I here proclaime my selfe euer faithfull in the first, and never guilty of the last: yet since some of my Playes have (unknowne to me, and without any of my direction) accidentally come into the Printers hands, and therefore so corrupt and mangled, copied onely by the eare) that I have beene as unable to know them, as ashamed to challenge them. This therefore I was the willinger to furnish out in his native habit: first being by consent, next because the rest have been so wronged, in being publisht in such savage and ragged ornaments: Accept it courteous Gentlemen, and proove as favourable Readers as we have found you gracious Auditors. Yours, T. H.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SENATE. Enter Tarquin Superbus, Sextus Tarquinius, Tullia, Aruns, Lucretius, Valerius, Poplicola, and Senators before them. Tul. Withdraw! we must have private conference With our deere husband Tar. What would'd thou wife? Tul. Be what I am not, make thee greater farre Then thou canst aime to be Tar. Why, I am Tarquin. Tul. And I Tullia, what of that? What Diapasons, more in Tarquins name Then in a Subjects? or what's Tullia More in the sound, then to become the name Of a poore maid or waiting Gentlewoman? I am a Princesse both by birth and thoughts, Yet all's but Tullia, ther's no resonance In a bare stile: my title beares no breadth; Nor hath it any state: oh me, im'e sicke! Tar. Sicke Lady? Tul. Sicke at heart. Tar. Why my sweet Tullia? Tul. To be a queen I long, long, and am sicke. With ardency my hot appetite's a fire, Till my swolne ferver be delivered Of that great title queene, my heart's all Royall, Not to be circumscribed in servile bounds, While there's a King that rules the Peeres of Rome. Tarquin makes legs, and Tullia curtsies low, Bowes at each nod, and must not neere the state Without obeysance, oh! I hate this awe, my proud heart cannot brook it. Tar. Heare me wife. Tul. I am no wife of Tarquins if not King: Oh had Iove made me man, I would have mounted Above the base tribunals of the earth, Vp to the Clouds, for pompous soveraignty. Thou art a man, oh bare my royall mind, Mount heaven, and see if Tullia lag behinde, There is no earth in me, I am all fire, Were Tarquin so, then should we both aspire. Tar. Oh Tullia, though my body taste of dulnesse, My soule is wing'd, to soare as high as thine, But noate what flags our wings, fourty five yeeres The King thy father hath protected Rome. Tul. That makes for us: the people covet change, Even the best things in time grow tedious. Tar. T'would seeme unnaturall in thee, my Tullia, The reverend King, thy father to depose: Tul. A kingdoms quest, makes sonnes and fathers foes. Tar. And but by Servius fall we cannot climbe, The balme that must anoint us is his blood. Tul. Lets lave our brows then in that crimson flood, We must be bold and dreadiefle: who aspires, Mounts by the lives of Fathers, Sons, and Sires. Tar. And so must I, since for a kingdomes love, Thou canst despise a Father for a Crowne: Tarquin shall mount, Servius be tumbled downe, For he usurps my state, and first deposd My father in my swathed infancy, For which he shall be countant: to this end I have sounded all the Peeres and Senators, And though unknowne to thee my Tullia, They all imbrace my faction; and so they Love change of state, an new King to obey. Tul. Now is my Tarquin worthy Tullias grace. Since in my armes, I thus a King embrace. Tar. The King should meet this day in Parlament. With all the Senate and Estates of Rome, His place will I assume, and there proclaime, All our decrees in Royall Tarquins name. Florish. Enter Sextus, Aruns, Lucretius, Valerius, Collatine and Senators. Luc. May it please thee noble Tarquin to attend The King this day in the high Capitoll? Tul. Attend? Tar. We intend this day to see the Capitoll. You knew our Father good Lucretius: Luc. I did my Lord. Tar. Was not I his Son? The Queen my mother was of royall thoughts And pure heart, as unblemisht Innocence. Luc. What askes my Lord? Tar. Sonnes should succeed their fathers, but anon You shall heare more, high time that we were gone. Florish. Exeunt Manet Collatine and Valerius. Col. Ther's morall sure in this, Valerius. Heeres modell, yea, and matter too to breed Strange Meditations in the provident braines Of our grave Fathers: some strange project lives This day in Cradle that's but newly borne. Val. No doubt Colatine no doubt, heres a giddy and drunken world, it Reeles, it hath got the staggers, the commonwealth is sicke of an Ague, of which nothing can cure her but some violent and sudden affrightment. Col. The wife of Tarquin would be a Queen nay, of my life she is with childe till she be so. Val. And longs to be brought to bed of a Kingdome, I divine, we shall see some scuffling to day in the Capitoll. Col. If there be any difference among the Princes and Senate, whose faction will Valerius follow? Val. Oh Collatine, I am a true Citizen, and in this I will best shew my selfe to be one, to take part with the strongest. If Servius orecome, I am Liegeman to Servius and if Tarquin subdue, I am for vive Tarquinius. Col. Valerius, no more, this talke does but keep us from the sight of this solemnity: by this the Princes are entring the Capitoll: come, we must attend. Exeunt SENATE. Tarquin, Tullia, Sextus, Aruns, Lucretius one way: Brutus meeting them the other way very humorously. Tar. This place is not for fooles, this parliament Assembles not the straines of Ideotisme, Onely the grave and wisest of the Land: Important are th'affaires we have in hand. Hence with that Mome. Luc. Brutus forbeare the presence. Brut. Forbeare the presence! why pra'y? Sext. None are admitted to this grave concourse But wise men: nay good Brutus. Brut. Youl'e have an empty Parliament then. Aru. Here is no roome for fooles. Bru. Then what mak'st thou here, or he, or he? oh Iupiter! if this command be kept strictly, we shall have empty Benches: get you home you that are here, for here wil be nothing to do this day: a generall concourse of wise men, t'was never seene since the first Chaos. Tarquin, if the generall rule have no exceptions thou wilt have an empty Consistory. Tul. Brutus you trouble us. Bru. How powerfull am I you Roman deities, that am able to trouble her that troubles a whole Empire? fooles exempted, and women admitted! laugh Democritus, but have you nothing to say to Mad-men? Tar. Madmen have here no place! Bru. Then out of doores with Tanquin, what's he that may sit in a calme valley, and will chuse to repose in a tempestuous mountaine, but a mad-man? that may live in tranquillous pleasures, and will seek out a kingdomes cares, but a madman? who would seek innovation in a Common-wealth in publike, or be over-rul'd by a curst wife in private, but a fool or a madman? give me thy hand Tarquin, shall we two be dismist together from the Capitoll? Tar. Restraine his follie. Tul. Drive the frantique hence. Aru. Nay Brutus. Sext. Good Brutus. Bru. Nay soft, soft good blood of the Tarquins, lets have a few cold words first, and I am gone in an instant, I claime the priviledge of the Nobility of Rome, and by that priviledge my seat in the Capitol. I am a Lord by birth, my place is as free in the Capitol as Horatius, thine, or thine Lucretius, thine Sextus, Aruns thine, or any here: I am a Lord and you banish all the Lord fooles from the presence, youle have few to wait vpon the King, but Gentlemen: nay, I am easily perswaded then, hands off, since you will not have my company, you shall have my roome. My roome indeed, for what I seeme to be, Brutus is not, but borne great Rome to free. The state is full of dropsie, and swollen big With windie vapors, which my sword must pierce, To purge th'infected blood, bred by the pride Of these infested bloods: nay now I goe, Behold I vanish since tis Tarquins minde, One small foole goes, but great fooles leaves behinde. Exit Lucre. Tis pittie one so generously deriv'd, Should be depriv'd his best inducments thus, And want the true directions of the Soule. Tar. To leave these delatorie trifles, Lords Now to the publique businesse of the Land. Lords take your severall places. Luc. Not great Tarquin, before the King assume his regall throne. Whose comming we attend. Tulli. Hee's come already. Luc. The King? Tar. The King. Col. Servius? Tar. Tarquinus. Lucre. Servius is King. Tar. He was by power divine, The Throne that long since he usurpt is mine. Heere we enthrone our selves, Cathedrall state Long since detaind us, justly we resume, Then let our friends and such as love us crie, Live Tarquin and enjoy this Soveraigntie. Omnes. Live Tarquin and injoy this Soveraignty. Florish. Enter Valerius. Vale. The King himselfe with such confederate Peeres. As stoutly embrace his faction, being inform'd Of Tarquins Vsurpation, armed comes, Neere to the entrance of the Capitoll. Tarq. No man give place, he that dares to arise And doe him reverence, we his love despise. Enter Servius, Horatius, Scevola, Souldiers. Ser. Traytor. Tar. Vsurper. Ser. Descend. Tullia. Sit still. Ser. In Servius name, Romes great imperiall Monarch, I charge thee Tarquin disinthrone thy selfe, And throw thee at our feet, prostrate for mercy. Hor. Spoke like a King. Tar. In Tarquins name, now Romes imperiall Monarch, We charge thee Servius make free resignation, Of that archt-wreath thou hast usurpt so long. Tul. Words worth an Empire. Hor. Shall this be brookt my Soveraigne: Dismount the Traitor. Sex. Touch him he that dares. Hor. Dares! Tul. Dares. Ser. Strumpet, no childe of mine. Tul. Dotard, and not my father. Ser. Kneele to thy King? Tul. Submit thou to thy queene. Ser. Insufferable treason with bright steele, Lop downe these interponents that withstand. The passage to our throne. Hor. That Cocles dares. Sex. We with our steele guard Tarquin and his chaire, Sce. A Servius. Servius is slaine. Aru. A Tarquin. Tar. Now are we king indeede, our awe is builded Vpon this Royall base, the slaughtered body Of a dead King: we by his ruine rise To a Monarchall Throne. Tul. We have our longing. My fathers death gives me a second life Much better then the first, my birth was servile, But this new breath of raigne is large and free, Welcome my second life of Soveraignty. Luc. I have a Daughter, but I hope of mettle, Subject to beter temperature, should my Lucrece Be of this pride, these hands should sacrifice Her blood vnto the Gods that dwell below, The abortiue brat should not out-live my spleene, But Lucrece is my Daughter, this my queene. Tul. Teare off the Crowne, that yet empales the temples Of our usurping Father: quickly Lords, And in the face of his yet bleeding wounds, Let us receive our honours. Tar. The same breath Gives our state life, that was the Vsurpers death. Tul. Here then by heavens hand wee invest our selves: Musique, whose loftiest tones grace Princes crown'd, Vnto our novel Coronation sound. Florish. Enter Valerius with Horatius and Scevola. Tarq. Whom doth Valerius to our state present? Val Two valiant Romans, this Horatius Cocles, This Gentleman calld Mutius Scevola. Who whilst King Servius wore the Diadem, Vpheld his sway and Princedome by their loves, But he being falne, since all the Peeres of Rome Applaud King Tarquin in his Soveraignty, They with like suffrage greet your Coronation. Hor. This hand alide vnto the Roman Crowne, Whom never feare dejected, or cast low, Laies his victorious sword at Tarquins feet, And prostrates with that sword allegiance. King Servius life we lov'd, but he expir'd. Great Tarquins life is in our hearts desir'd. Sce. Who whilst he rules with justice and integrity Shall with our dreadles hands our hearts command, Even with the best imploiments of our lives, Since Fortune lifts thee, we submit to Fate, Our selves are vassals to the Roman state. Tarq. Your roomes were emptie in our traine of friends, Which we rejoyce to see so well supplide: Receive our grace, live in our element favours, In whose submission our young glory growes To his ripe height: fall in our friendly traine, And strengthen with your loves our infant Raigne. Hor. We live for Tarquin. Sce. And to thee alone, whilst justice keeps thy sword and thou thy Throne. Tar. Then are you ours, and now conduct us straight In triumph through the populous streets of Rome. To the Kings Palace our Majesticke seat. Your hearts though freely proffred, we intreat. Sennat. As they march, Tullia treads on her Father &amp; staies. Tullia. What blocke is that we tread on? Luc. Tis the bodie Of your deceased Father Madam, Queene Your shoe is crimsond with his vitall blood. Tul. No matter, let his mangled body lie, And with his base consederates strew the streets, That in disgrace of his usurped pride, We ore his truncke may in our Chariot ride: For mounted like a Queene t'would doe me good To wash my Coach-naves in my fathers blood. Luc. Heres a good Childe. Tar. Remove it wee command, and beare his carcasse to the funerall pile, Where after this dejection, let it have His solemne and due obsequies: faire Tullia, Thy hate to him growes from thy love to us, Thou shewest thy selfe in this unnaturall strife An unkind Daughter, but a loving wife. But on unto our Palace, this blest day, A Kings encrease growes by a Kings decay. Brutus alone. Brut. Murder the King! a high and Capitoll treason, Those Giants that wag'd warre against the Gods, For which the ore-whelmed Mountaines hurld by Iove To scatter them, and give them timeles graves Was not more cruell then this butcherie, This slaughter made by Tarquin; but the Queene, A woman, fie fie: did not this shee-paracide Adde to her fathers wounds? and when his body Lay all besmeard and staynd in the blood royall, Did not this Monster, this infernall hag, Make her unwilling Chariotter drive on, And with his shod wheeles crush her Fathers bones? Break his craz'd scull, and dash his sparckled braines Vpon the pavements, whilst she held the raines? The affrighted Sun at this abhorred object, Put on a maske of bloud, and yet she blusht not. Iove art thou just; hast thou reward for pietie? And for offence no vengeance? or canst punish Fellons, and pardon Traitors? chastise Murderers, And winke at Paracides? if thou be worthy, As well we know thou art, to fill the Throne Of all eternitie, then with that hand That flings the Trisulke thunder, let the pride Of these our irreligious Monarkisers Be Crown'd in blood: this makes poore Brutus mad, To see sin frolique, and the vertuous sad. Enter Sextus and Aruns. Aru. Soft, heeres Brutus, let us acquaint him with the newes. Sex. Content: now Cousen Brutus. Bru. Who, I your kinsman? though I be of the blood of the Tarquins yet no cousen gentle Prince. Aru. And why so Brutus, Scorne you our aliance? Bru. No, I was cousen to the Tarquins, when they were subjects, but dare claime no kindred as they are soveraignes: Brutus is not so mad though he be merry, but he hath wit enough to keepe his head on his shoulders. Aru. Why doe you Lord thus loose your houres, and neither professe warre nor domestick profit? the first might beget you love, the other riches. Bru. Because I would live, have I not answered you, because I would live? fooles and mad men are no rubs in the way of Vsurpers, the firmament can brooke but one Sunne, and for my part I must not shine: I had rather live an obscure blacke, then appeare a faire white to be shot at, the end of all is, I would live: had Servius beene a shrub, the wind had not shooke him, or a mad-man, hee not perisht: I covet no more wit nor imployment then as much as will keepe life and soule together, I would but live. Aru. You are satyricall cousen Brutus, but to the purpose: the king dreampt a strange and ominous dream last night, and to be resolv'd of the event, my brother Sextus and I must to the Oracle Sex. And because we would be well accompanied, wee have got leave of the king that you Brutus shall associate us, for our purpose is to make a merry journey on't. Bru. So youle carry, me along with you to be your foole and make you merrie. Sex. Not our foole, butâ Bru. To make you merry: I shall, nay, I would make you merrie or tickle you till you laugh: the Oracle! ile go to be resolv'd of some doubts private to my selfe: nay Princes, I am so much indeer'd both to your loves and companies, that you shall not have the power to be rid of me, what limits have we for our journey? Sext. Five dayes, no more. Brut. I shall fit me to your preparations, but one thing more goes Collatine along? Sext. Collatine is troubled with the common disease of all new married men, he's sicke of the wife, his excuse is forsooth that Lucrece will not let him goe, but you having neither wife nor wit to hold you I hope will not disappoint us Bru. Had I both, yet should you, prevaile with me above either, Aru. We shall expect you. Bru. Horatius Cocles, and Mutius Scevola are not engag'd in this expedition? Aru. No, they attend the King farewell. Bru. Lucretius stayes at home too and Valerius? Sext. The Palace cannot spare them. Bru. None but we three? Sex. We three. Bru. We three, well five dayes hence. Sex. You have the time, farewell. Exeunt, Sextus and Aruns. Bru. The time I hope cannot be Circumscribde. Within so short a limit, Rome and I Are not so happy; what's the reason then, Heaven spares his rod so long? Mercurie tell me! I hav't, the fruit of pride is yet but greene, Not mellow, though it growes apace, it comes not To his full height: Iove oft delayes his vengeance, That when it haps t'may proove more terrible. Dispaire not Brutus then, but let thy countrey And thee take this last comfort after all, Pride when thy fruit is ripe t'must rot, and fall. But to the Oracle. Enter Horatius Cocles, Mutius Scevola. Hor. I would I were no Romane. Sce. Cocles why? Hor. I am discontented and dare not speake my thoughts. Sce. What, shall I speake them for you? Hor. Mutius doe. Scevo. Tarqin is proud. Hora. Thou hast them. Scevo. Tyrannous. Hor. True. Sce. Insufferably loftie. Hor, Thou hast hit me. Scev. And shall I tell thee what I prophesie Of his succeeding rule? Ho. No, Il'e doo't for thee, Tarquins abilitie will in the weale, Beget a weake unable impotence: His strength, make Rome and our Dominions weak His soaring high make us to flag our wings, And flie close by the earth: his golden feathers Are of such vastnes, that they spread like sayles, And so becalme us that wee haue not aire Able to raise our plumes, to taste the pleasures of our own Elements. Scevo. Wee are one heart, our thoughts and our desires are sutable. Hor. Since he was King he beares him like a God, His wife like Pallas, or the wife of Iove. Will not be spoke to without sacrifice, And homage sole due to the Deities. Enter Lucretius Scevo. What hast with good Lucretius? Lucre. Hast but small speed, I had an earnest suit vnto the King, About some businesse that concernes the weale Of Rome and us, twill not be listned too, He has tooke upon him such ambitious state, That he abandons conference with his Peeres, Or if he chance to endure our tongues so much, As but to heare their sonance, he despises The intent of all our speeches, our advices, And counsell: thinking his owne judgement only To be approved in matters militarie, And in affaires domesticke, we are but mutes, And fellowes of no parts, violes unstrung, Our notes too harsh to strike in Princes eares. Great Iove amend it. Hor. Whither will von my Lord? Luc. No matter where it from the court, Ile home to Collatine And to my, daughter Lucrece: home breeds safety, Dangers begot in Court, a life retir'd Must please me now perforce: then noble Scevola, And you my deere Horatius, farewell both, Where industrie is scornd lets welcome sloth. Enter Collatine. Hora. Nay good Lucretius doe not leave us thus, See heere comes Collatine, but wheres Valerius? How does he taste these times? Col. Not giddily like Brutus, passionately Like old Lucretius with his teare swolne eies, Not laughingly like Mutius Scevola. Nor bluntly like Horatius Cocles here. He has usurpt a stranger garbe of humour, Distinct from these in nature every way. Luc. How is he relisht, can his eyes forbeare? In this strange state to shed a passionate teare. Sce. Can he forbeare to laugh with Scevola, At that which passionate weeping cannot mend? Hora. Nay can his thought shape ought but melancholly To see these dangerous passages of state, How is he tempered noble Collatine? Colla. Strangely, he is all song, hee's ditty all, Note that: Valerius hath given up the Court And weand himselfe from the Kings consistory In which his sweet harmonious tongue grew harsh, Whether it be that he is discontent, Yet would not so appeare before the King, Or whether in applause of these new Edicts, Which so distaste the people, or what cause I know not, but now hee's all musicall. Vnto the Counsell chamber he goes singing, And whil'st the King his willful Edicts makes, In which nones tongue is powerfull save the Kings, Hee's in a corner relishing strange aires. Conclusively hee's from a toward hopefull Gentleman, Transeshapt to a meere Ballater, none knowing Whence should proceed this transmutation. Enter Valerius Hor. See where he comes. Morrow Valerius. Lucre. Morrow my Lord. Song. Val. When Tarquin first in Court began, And was approved King: Some men for sudden joy gan weep, But I for sorrow sing. Sce. Ha, ha, how long has my Valerius Put on this straine of mirth, or what's the cause? Song Val. Let humor change and spare not, Since Tarquin's proud, I care not, His faire words so bewitch my delight, That I doted on his sight. Now he is chang'd cruell thoughts embracing And my deserts disgracing. Hor. Vpon my life he's either mad or love-sicke, Oh can Valerius, but so late a States-man, Of whom the publike weale deserv d so well, Tune out his age in Songs and Cansoners. Whose voice should thunder counsell in the eares Of Tarquin and proud Tullia? think Valerius What that proud woman Tullia is, twill put thee Quite out of Tune. Song. Val. Now what is love I will thee tell, It is the fountain and the well, Where pleasure and repentance dwell, It is perhaps the sansing bell, That rings all in to heaven or hell. And this is love, and this is love, as I heere tell. Now what is love I will you show, A thing that creeps and cannot goe: A prize that passeth too and fro, A thing for me, a thing for moe, And he that proves shall finde it so, And this is love, and this is love, sweet friend I tro. Lucre. Valerius. I shall quickly change thy cheere, And make thy passionate eyes lament with mine, Thinke how that worthy Prince our kinsman King Was butchered in the Marble Capitoll. Shall Servius Tullius unregarded die Alone of thee, whome all the Romane Ladies, Even yet with teare swollen eyes, and sorrowfull soules, Compassionate as well he merited; To these lamenting dames what canst thou sing? whose griefe through all the Romane Temples ring. Song. Va. Lament Ladies lament, Lament the Roman land, The King is fra thee hent. Was doughtie on his hand, Weele gang into the Kirk, His dead corps weele embrace, And when we se him dead, We ay will cry alas. Fa la. Hora. This musicke mads me, I all mirth despise. Luc. To heare him sing drawes rivers from mine eyes. Sceuo. It pleaseth me for since the court is harsh, And lookes a skance on souldiers, lets be merry, Court Ladies, sing, drinke, dance, and every man Get him a mistris coach it in the Countrey, And tast the sweetes of it, what thinks Valerius Of Sevolacs last counsell? Song. Va. Why since we souldiers cannot prove, And griefe it is to us therfore, Let every man get him a love, To trim her well, and fight no more. That we may taste of lovers blisse, Be merry and blith, imbrace and kisse, That Ladies may say some more of this, That Ladies may say, some more of this. Since Court and Citie both grow proud, And safety you delight to heare, Wee in the Country will us shroud, Where lives to please both eye and eare: The Nightingale sings Iug, Iug, Iug, The little Lambe leaps after his dug, And the prety milke-maids they looke so smug. And the prety milke-maids, &amp;c. Come Scevola shall we goe and be idle? Luc. Ile in to weepe. Hora. But I my gall to grate. Scevo. Ile laugh at time, till it will change our Fate. Exeunt they. Manet Collatine. Colla. Thou art not what thou seem'st, Lord Scevola, Thy heart mournes in thee, though thy visage smile, And so doe's thy soule weepe, Valerius, Although thy habit sing, for these new humours Are but put on for safety, and to arme them Against the pride of Tarquin, from whose danger, None great in love, in counsell; or opinion, Can be kept safe: this makes me loose my houres At home with Lucrece, and abandon court. Enter Clowne. Clow. Fortune I, embrace thee, that thou hast assisted me in finding my master, the Gods of good Rome keepe my Lord and master out of all bad company. Colla. Sirra the newes with you. Clow. Would you ha Court newes, Camps newes, City newes or Country newes, or would you know whats the newes at home? Col. Let me know all the newes. Clow. The newes at Court is; that a smale leg and a silk stocking is in the fashion for your Lord: And the water that God Mercury makes is in request with your Ladie. The heavines of the kings wine makes many a light head and the emtines of his dishes many full bellies; eating and drinking was never more in use: you shall finde the baddest legs in boots, and the worst faces in masks. They keepe their old stomackes still, the kings good Cooke had the most wrong: for that which was wont to be private only to him, is now usurpt among all the other officers: for now every man in his place, to the prejudice of the master Cooke, makes bold to licke his owne fingers. Col. The newes in the campe. Clow. The greatest newes in the campe is, that there is no newes at all, for being no campe at all, how can there be any tidings from it? Col. Then for the city, Col. The Senators are rich, their wives faire, credit grows cheap, and traffick dear, for you have many that are broke, the poorest man that is, may take vp what he will, so he will be but bound (to a post till he pay the debt) There was one courtier lay with twelve mens wives in the suburbs, and pressing farther to make one more cuckold within the walles, and being taken with the manner, had nothing to say for himselfe, but this, he that made twelve made thirteene. Col. Now sir for the countrey. Clo. There is no newes there but at the Ale-house, ther's the most receit, and it is now strange my Lord, that so many men love ale that know not what ale is. Col. Why, what is ale? Clo. Why, ale is a kind of juice made of the precious grain called Malt, and what is malt? Malt's M, A, L, T, and what is M, A, L, T? M much, A ale, L little, T thrist, that is, much ale, little thrist. Cola. Only the newes at home and I have done. Clow. My Lady must needes speake with you about earnest businesse, that concernes her neerely, and I was sent in all haste to entreat your Lordship to come away. Col. And couldest thou not have told me? Lucrece stay, And I stand trifling here? follow, away. Clow. I marry sir, the way into her were a way worth following, and that's the reason that so many Serving-man that are familiar with their Mistrisses, have lost the name of Servitors, and are now call'd their masters Followers. Rest you merry. Sound Musicke. Apollo's Priests with Tapers, after them, Aruns, Sextus and Brutus with their oblations, all kneeling before the Oracle. Priest. O thou Delphian god inspire Thy Priests, and with celestiall fire Shot from thy beames crowne our desire, that we may follow, In these thy true and hallowed measures, The utmost of thy heavenly treasures, According to the thoughts and pleasures Of great Apollo. Our hearts with inflamations burne, Great Tarquin and his people mourne, Till from thy Temple we returne. With some glad tyding. Then tell us, Shall great Rome be blest, And royall Tarquin live in rest, That gives his enobled brest To thy safe guiding? Oracle. Then Rome her ancient honours wins, When she is purg'd from Tullia's sins. Brut. Gramercies PhÅbus for these spels, PhÅbus alone, alone excells. Sext. Tullia perhaps sinn'd in our grandsires death, And hath not yet by reconcilement made Attone with PhÅbus, at whose shrine we kneele: Yet gentle Priest let us thus farre prevaile, To know if Tarquins seed shall governe Rome, And by succession claime the royall wreath? Behold me younger of the Tarquins race: This elder Aruns, both the sonnes of Tullia, This Iunius Brutus, though a mad-man, yet Of the high blood of the Tarquins. Priest. Sextus peace: Tell us, O thou that shin'st so bright, From whom the world receives his light, Whose absence is perpetuall night, Whose praises ring: Is it with heavens applause decreed, When Tarquins soule from earth is freed, That noble Sextus shall succeed In Rome as King? Brut. I Oracle, hast thou lost thy tongue? Aru. Tempt him againe faire Priest. Sext. If not as King, let Delphian PhÅbus yet Thus much resolve us, Who shall governe Rome, Or of us three beare greatest preheminence? Priest. Sextus I will, yet sacred PhÅbus we entreat, Which of these three shall be great With largest power and state repleate By the heavens doome? PhÅbus thy thoughts no longer smother. Oracle. He that first shall kisse his mother. Shall be powerfull, and no other Of you three in Rome. Sext. Shall kisse his mother! Brutus falls. Brut. Mother Earth, to thee an humble kisse I tender. Aru. What means Brutus? Brut. The blood of the slaughter'd sacrifice made this floore as slippery as the place where Tarquin treads, tis glassie and as smoothe as ice: I was proud to heare the Oracle so gracious to the blood of the Tarquins and so I fell. Sext. Nothing but so, then to the Oracle. I charge thee Aruns, Iunius Brutus thee, To keep the sacred doome of the Oracle From all our traine, lest when the younger lad Our brother now at home, sits dandled Vpon faire Tullias lap, this understanding May kisse our beauteous mother, and succeed. Aru. Let the charge goe round, It shall goe hard but ile prevent you Sextus. Sex. I feare not the madman Brutus, and for Aruns let me alone to buckle with him, Il'e be the first at my mothers lips for a kingdome. Bru. If the madman have not bin before you Sextus, if Oracles be Oracles, their phrases are mysticall, they speak still in clouds: had he meant a naturall mother he would not ha spoke it by circumstance. Sex. Tullia, if ever thy lips were pleasing to me, let it be at my returne from the Oracle. Aru. If a kisse will make me a King, Tullia I will spring to thee though through the blood of Sextus. Brut. Earth I acknowledge no mother but thee, accept me as thy Son, and I shall shine as bright in Rome as Apollo him selfe in his temple at Delphos. Sext. Our Superstitions ended, sacred Priest, Since we have had free answere from the Gods, To whose faire altars we have done due right, And hollowed them with presents acceptable, Lets now returne, treading these holy measures, With which we entred great Apollo's Temple. Now PhÅbus let thy sweet tun'd organes sound, Whose sphere like musicke must direct our feet Vpon the marble pavement: after this Weele gaine a kingdome by a mothers kisse. Exeunt. SENATE. A table and chaires prepared, Tarquin, Tullia, and Collatine, Scevola, Horatius, Lucretius, Valerius, Lords. Tarquin. Attend us with your persons, but your eares Be deafe unto our counsells. The Lords fall off on either side and attend. Tul. Farther yet. Tarq. Now Tullia what must be concluded next? Tullia. The kingdome you have got by pollicy You must maintaine by pride. Tarquin. Good. Tullia. Those that were late of the Kingsfaction cut off for feare they prove rebellious. Tarq. Better. Tullia Since you gaine nothing by the popular love, Maintaine by feare your Princedome. Tar. Excellent, thou art our Oracle and save from thee We will admit no counsell, we obtaind Our state by cunning, it must be kept by strength. And such as cannot love, weele teach to feare, To encourage which upon our better judgement, And to strike greater terrour to the world, I have forbid thy fathers funerall. Tul. No matter. Tar. All capitall causes are by us discust, Traverst, and executed without counsell, We challenge too by our prerogative, The goods of such as strive against our state, The freest Citizens without attaint, Arraigne, or judgement, we to exile doome, The poorer are our drudges, rich our prey, And such as dare not strive our rule obey. Tul. Kings are as Gods, and divine Scepters beare, The Gods command for mortall tribute, feare. But Royall Lord, we that despise their love, Must seeke some meanes how to mayntaine this awe. Tar. By forraigne leagues, and by our strength abroad. Shall we that are degreed above our people, Whom heaven hath made our vassals, raigne with them? No, Kings above the rest tribunald hie, Should with no meaner then with Kings allie: For this we to Mamilius Tusculan The Latin King ha given in marriage Our Royall daughter: Now his people's ours, The neighbour Princes are subdude by armes: And whom we could not conquer by constraint, Them we have sought to win by curtesie, Kings that are proud, yet would secure their owne, By love abroad, shall purchase feare at home. Tul. We are secure, and yet our greatest strength Is in our children, how dare treason looke Vs in the face having issue? barren Princes Breed danger in their singularitie, Having none to succeed, their claime dies in them. Tar. Tullia's wise, and apprehensive, were our Princely sons Sextus and Aruns backe returned safe, With an applausive answere of the Gods From th'Oracle, our state were able then Being Gods our selves, to scorne the hate of men. Enter Sextus, Aruns, and Brutus. Sex. Where's Tullia? Aru. Where's our Mother? Hor. Yonder Princes, at Councel with the King. Tul. Our sonnes return'd. Sex. Royall Mother. Aru. Renowned Queen. Sex. I love her best, therefore will Sextus do his duty first. Aru. Being eldest in my birth, ile not be yonngest In zeale to Tullia. Brut. Too't Lads. Aruns. Mother a kisse. Sex. Though last in birth let me be first in love. A kisse faire mother. Aru. Shall I loose my right? Sext. Aruns shall downe, were Aruns twice my Brother, If he persume fore me to kisse my mother. Aru. I Sextus, think this kisse to be a Crowne, thus would we tug for't. Sex. Aruns thou must downe. Tarq. Restraine them Lords. Bru. Nay too't boyes, O tis brave, they tug for shadowes, I the substance have. Aru. Through armed gates, and thousand swords ile break To shew my duty, let my valour speake. Breakes from the Lords and kisses her. Sex. Oh heavens! you have disolv'd me. Aru. Here I stand, what I ha done to answer with this hand. Sex. Oh all ye Delphian Gods looke downe and see How for these wrongs I will revenged be. Tar. Curbe in the prowd boyes fury, let us know From whence this discord riseth. Tullia. From our love, how happy are we in our issue now When as our sons, even with their blouds contend To exceed in dutie, we accept your zeale. This your superlative degree of kindnesse So much prevailes with us, that to the King We engage our owne deere love twixt his incensement And your presumption, you are pardoned both. And Sextus though you faild in your first proffer, We do not yet esteeme you least in love, ascend and touch our lips. Sext. Thanke you, no. Tullia. Then to thy knee we will descend thus low. Sex. Nay now it shall not need: how great's my heart! Aru. In Tarquins Crowne thou now hast lost thy part. Sex. No kissing now, Tarquin, great Queene adiew. Aruns, on earth we ha no foe but you. Tarq. What meanes this their unnaturall enmitie? Tullia. Hate, borne from love. Tar. Resolve us then, how did the Gods accept Our sacrifice, how are they pleas'd with us? How long will they applaud our soveraignty? Bru. Shall I tell the King. Tar. Doe Cousen, with the processe of your journey. Bru. I will. We went from hither, when we went from hence, arrived thither when we landed there, made an end of our prayers when we had done our Orisones, when thus quoth PhÅbus, Tarquin shall be happy whilst he is blest, governe while he raignes, wake when he sleepes not, sleepe when he wakes not, quaffe when he drinks, feede when he eates, gape when his mouth opens, live till he die, and die when he can live no longer. So PhÅbus commends him to you. Tar. Mad Brutus still, Son Aruns, What say you? Aru. That the great Gods to whom the potent King Of this large Empire sacrific'd by us, Applaud your raigne, commend your soveraignty: And by a generall Synode grant to Tarquin, Long dayes faire hopes Majestique government. Bru. Adding withall, that to depose the late King which in others, had been arch-treason, in Tarquin was honor: what in Brutus had been usurpation, in Tarquin was lawful succession: and for Tullia, though it be paracide for a childe to kill her father, in Tullia it was charity by death, to rid him of all his calamities, PhÅbus himselfe said she was a good childe, and shall not I say as he sayes, to tread upon her fathers skull, sparkle his braines upon her Chariot wheele, And weare the sacred tincture of his blood Vpon her servile shoe? but more then this, After his death deny him the due claime Of all mortality, a funerall, An earthen sepulchre, this, this, quoth the Oracle, Save Tullia none would do. Tul. Brutus no more, least with the eyes of wrath and fury incenst We looke into thy honour: were not madnes And folly to thy words a priviledge, Even in thy last reproofe of our proceedings Thou hast pronounc't thy death. Bru. If Tullia will send Brutus abroad for newes, and after at his returne not endure the telling of it: let Tullia either get closer eares, or get for Brutus a stricter tongue. Tullia. How sir? Bru. God bo'ye. Tarq. Alas tis madnes (pardon) not spleene, Nor is it hate, but frenzie, we are pleasd To heare the Gods propitious to our prayers. But whither's Sextus gone? resolve us Cocles. We saw thee in his parting follow him. Hora. I heard him say, he would straight take his horse And to the werlike Gabines enemies to Rome, and you. Tar. Save them we have no opposites. Dares the proud boy confederate with our foes? Attend us Lords, we must new battle wage, And with bright armes confront the proud boyes rage. Exeunt. Manet, Lucretius, Collatine, Horatius, Valerius, Scevola. Hor. Had I as many soules as drops of blood In these brancht vaines, as many lives as starres Stucke in yond' azure Rose, and were to die More deaths then I have wasted weary minutes, To grow to this, ide hazard all and more, To purchase freedome to thus bondag'd Rome. I'me vext to see this virgin conqueresse weare shaekles in my sight. Luc. Oh would my teares would rid great Kome of these prodigious feares. Enter Brutus. Bru. What, weeping ripe Lucretius? possible? now Lords, Lads, friends, fellows, yong madcaps, gallants, and old courtly ruffians, all subjects under one tyranny, and therefore should be partners of one and the same unanimity. Shall we goe single our selves by two and two, and go talk treason? then tis but his yea, and my nay, if we be cald to question: Or shals goe use some violent bustling to breake through this thorny servitude, or shal we every man go sit like, O man in desperation, and with Lucretius weepe at Romes misery: now am I for all things any thing or nothing, I can laugh with Scevola, weepe with this good old man, sing oh hone hone with Valerius, fret with Horatius Cocles, be mad like my selfe, or neutrize with Collatine. Say what shal's doe? Hora. Fret. Val. Sing. Luc. Weepe. Scevo. Laugh. Bru. Rather lets all be mad that Tarquin he still raigneth, Rom's still sad. Col. You are madmen all that yeild so much to passion. You lay your selves too open to your enemies, That would be glad to prie into your deedes, And catch advantage to ensnare our lives. The kings feare, like a shadow, dogs you still, Nor can you walke without it: I commend Valerius most, and noble Scevola, That what they cannot mend, seeme not to mind, By my consent lets all weare out our houres In harmeles sports: hauke, hunt, game, sing, drinke, dance, So shall we seeme offencelesse and live safe. In dangers bloody jawes where being humerous, Cloudy and curiously inquisitive Into the Kings proceedings, there arm'd feare May search into us, call our deeds to question, And so prevent all future expectation: Of wisht amendment let us stay the time, Till heaven have made them ripe for just revenge, When opportunitie is offered us, And then strike home, till then doe what you please: No discontented thought my mind shall seaze. Bru. I am of Collatines mind now Valerius sing us a baudy song, and mak's merry: nay it shall be so. Valer. Brutus shall pardon me. Scev. The time that should have beene seriously spent in the State-house, I ha learnt securely to spend in a wenching house, and now I professe my selfe any thing but a Statesman. Hor. The more thy vanity. Luc. The lesse thy honour. Valer. The more his safety, and the lesse his feare. The first new Song. She that denies me, I would have, Who craves me, I despise. Venus hath power to rule mine heart, But not to please mine eyes. Temptations offered, I still scorne. Deny'd; I cling them still. Ile neither glut mine appetite, Nor seeke to starve my will. Diana, double cloath'd, offends; So Venus, naked quite. The last begets a surfet, and The other no delight. That crafty Girle shall please me best That No, for Yea, can say, And every wanton willing kisse Can season with a Nay. Brut. We ha beene mad Lords long, now lets us be merry Lords, Horatius maugre thy melancholly, and Lucreius in spight of thy sorrow, Ile have a song a subject for the ditty. Hor. Great Tarquins pride, and Tullia's cruelty. Bru. Dangerous, no. Luc. The tyrannies of the Court, and vassalage of the City. Sce. Neither, shall I give the subject? Bru. Doe, and let it be of all the pretty wenches in Rome. Scev. It shall, shall it, shall it Valerius? Val. Any thing according to my poore acquaintance and little conversance. Bru. Nay you shall stay Horatius, Lucretius so shall you, he removes himselfe from the love of Brutus, that shrinkes my side till we have had a song of all the pretty suburbians: sit round, when Valerius? Song. Val. Shall I woe the lovely Molly, She's so faire, so fat so jolly, But she has a tricke of folly, Therefore Ile ha none of Molly. No no no, no no, no. Ile ha none of Molly, no no no. Oh the cherry lips of Nelly, They are red and soft as jelly, But too well she loves her belly. Therefore ile have none of Nelly. No, no, no, &amp;c. What say you to bonny Betty, Ha you seene a lasse so pretty? But her body is so sweatty, Therefore ile ha none of Betty. No, no, no, no, no, When I dally with my Dolly, She is full of melancholly, Oh that wench is pestilent holly, Therefore ile have none of Dolly, No, no, no, &amp;c. I could fancy lovely Nanny, But she has the loves of many, Yet her selfe she loves not any. Therefore ile have none of Nanny, no, no, &amp;c. In a flax shop I spide Ratchell, Where she her flax and tow did hatchell, But her cheekes hang like a satchell, Therefore ile have none of Ratchell, No, no, &amp;c. In a corner I met Biddy, Her heeles were light her head was giddy, She fell downe and somewhat did I, Therefore ile have none of Biddy, No, no, &amp;c. Brut. The rest weel here within, what offence is there in this Lucretius? what hurt's in this Horatius? is it not better to sing with our heads on, then to bleed with our heads off? I nere took Collatine for a Politician till now, come Valerius, weel run over all the wenches of Rome, from the community of lascivious Flora to the chastity of divine Lucrece, come good Horatius. Exeunt. Enter Lucrece, Maide and Clowne. Luc. A Chaire. Clo. A chaire for my Lady, Mistris Mirable do you not here my Lady call. Luc. Come neere sir, be lesse officious In duty, and use more attention, Nay Gentlewoman we exempt not you From our discourse, you must afford an eare As well as he, to what we ha to say. Maid. I still remaine your hand-maide. Luc. Sirrah I ha seene you oft familiar With this my maide and waiting Gentlewoman, As casting amorous glances, wanton lookes, And privy becks savouring incontinence, I let you know you are not for my service Vnlesse you grow more civill. Clow. Indeed Madam for my owne part I wish Mistris Mirable well, as one fellow servant ought to wish to another, but to say as that ever I flung any sheeps eyes in her face how say you mistris Mirable did I ever offer it? Luc. Nay Mistris, I ha seene you answere him With gracious lookes, and some uncivill smiles, Retorting eyes, and giving his demenure Such welcome as becomes not modesty, Know hence-forth there shall no lascivious phrase, Suspitious looke, or shadow of incontinence, Be entertain'd by any that attend, on Roman Lucrece. Maide. Madam, I! Luc. Excuse it not, for my premeditate thought Speakes nothing out of rashnesse, nor vaine heare say. But what my owne experience testifies Against you both, let then this milde reproofe, Forewarne you of the like: my reputation Which is held precious in the eies of Rome, Shall be no shelter to the least intent Of loosenesse, leave all familiaritie, And quite renounce acquaintance, or I here, discharge you both my service. Clow. For my owne part Madam, as I am a true Roman by nature, though no Roman by my nose, I never spent the least lip labour on mistris Mirable, never so much as glanc'd, never us'd any wincking or pinking, never nodded at her, no not so much as when I was asleepe, never askt her the question so much as whats her name: if you bring any man, woman, or childe, that can say so much behinde my backe, as for he did but kisse her, for I did but kisse her and so let her go: let my Lord Collatine instead of plucking my coate, plucke my skin over my eares and turne me away naked, that wheresoever I shall come I may be held a raw Serving man hereafter. Luc. Sirrah, you know our mind. Clo. If ever I knew what belongs to these cases, or yet know what they meane, if ever I us'd any plaine dealing, or were ever worth such a jewell, would I might die like a begger: if ever I were so far read in my Grammer, as to know what an Interjection is, or a conjunction Copulative, would I might never have good of my qui quÅ quod: why, do you thinke Madam I have no more care of my selfe being but a stripling, then to goe to it at these yeares? flesh and blood cannot endure it, I shall euen spoile one of the best faces in Rome with crying at your unkindnesse. Luc. I ha done, see if you can spie your Lord returning from the Court, and give me notice what strangers he brings home with him. Enter Collatine, Valerius, Horatius Scevola. Clow. Yes ile go, but see kind man he saves me a labour. Hor. Come Valerius let's heare in our way to the house of Collatine, that you went late hammering of concerning the Taverns in Rome. Val. Only this Horatius. Song. The Gentry to the Kings head, The Nobles to the Crowne. The Knights unto the goulden Fleece, And to the plough the Clowne. The Church-man to the Miter. The Shep-heard to the Starre. The Gardiner, hies him to Rose, To the Drum the man of warre; To the Feathers Ladies you; the Globe The Sea-man doth not scorne The Vsurer to the Devill, and The Townesman to the Horne. The Huntsman to the white Hart, To the Ship the Marchant goes, But you that doe the Muses love The Swanne, calde River Poe. The Banquerout to the worlds end, The Foole to the Fortune hie. Vnto the Mouth, the Oyster wife, The Fidler to the Pie, The Punck unto the Cockecatrice. The Drunkard to the Vine, The Beggar to the Bush, then meete And with Duke Humphrey Dine. Col. Faire Lucrece, I ha brought these Lords from Court to feast with thee, sirrah prepare us dinner. Luc. My Lord is welcome, so are all his friends, the newes at Court Lords. Hor. Madam strange newes: Prince Sextus by the enemies of Rome. Was nobly us'de, and made their Generall, Twice hath he met his father in the field, And foild him by the Warlike Gabines aid: But how hath he rewarded that brave Nation, That in his great disgrace supported him? Ile tell you Madam he since the last battell Sent to his Father a close messenger To be receiv'd to grace, withall demanding What he should doe with those his enemies? Great Tarquin from his Sonne receives this newes, Being walking in his Garden: when the messenger Importunde him for answere, the proud King Lops with his wand the heads of Poppies off, And sayes no more; with this uncertaine answer The messenger to Sextus backe returnes, Who questions of his Fathers words, lookes, gesture? He tels him that the haughtie speechles King Straight apprehend, cuts off the great mens heads, And having left the Gabines without governe, Flies to his father, and this day is welcom'd For this his traiterous service by the King, With all due solemne honours to the Court. Scevo. Curtesie strangely requited, this none but the son of Tarquin would have enterprisde. Val. I like it, I applaud it, this will come to somewhat in the end, when heaven has cast up his account, some of them will be calde to a hard reckoning. For my part, I dreamt last night I went a fishing. The second new Song. Though the weather jangles With our hookes, and our angles, Our nets be shaken, and no fish taken: Though fresh Cod and Whiting, Are not this day biting, Gurnet, nor Conger, to satisfie hunger, Yet looke to our draught. Hale the maine bowling, The seas have left their rowling, The waves their huffing, the winds their puffing, Vp to the Top-mast Boy, And bring us news of joy, Heres no demurring, no fish is stirring. Yet some thing we have caught. Col. Leave all to heaven. Enter Clowne. Clow. My Lords, the best plumporedge in all Rome cooles for your honours, dinner is piping hot upon the table: and if you make not the more haste, you are like to have but cold cheare: the Cooke hath done his part, and there's not a dish on the dresser but he has made it smoke for you, if you have good stomackes, and come not in while the meat is hot, youl'e make hunger and cold meete together. Col. My man's a Rhetorician I can tell you, And his conceit is fluent: Enter Lords, You must be Lucrece guests, and she is scant In nothing, for such Princes must not want. Exeunt. Manet Valerius and Clowne. Clow. My Lord Valerius, I have even a suit to your honor, I ha not the power to part from you, without a rellish, a note, a tone, we must get an Aire betwixt us, Val. Thy meaning. Clo. Nothing but this, Iohn for the King has beene in many ballads, Iohn for the King downe dino, Iohn for King, has eaten many sallads, Iohn for the King sings hey ho. Val. Thou wouldst have a song, wouldst thou not? Clow. And be everlastingly bound to your honour, I am now forsaking the world and the Devill, and somewhat leaning towards the flesh, if you could but teach me how to choose a wench fit for my stature and complexion, I should rest yours in all good offices. Val. Ile doe that for thee, what's thy name? Clow. My name sir is Pompie. Val. Well then attend. He sings. Song. Pompie I will shew thee, the way to know A daintie dapper wench. First see her all bare, let her skin be rare And be toucht with no part of the French: Let her lookes be cleare, and her browes seuere, Her eye-browes thin and fine: But if she be a punck, and love to be drunke, Then keepe her still from the wine. Let her stature be meane, and her body cleane, Thou canst not choose but like her: But see she ha good clothes, with a faire Roman nose, For that's the signe of a striker. Let her legs be small, but not usd to sprall, Her tongue not too lowd nor cocket. Let her arms be strong, and her fingers long, But not us'd to dive in pocket. Let her body be long, and her backe be strong, With a soft lip that entangles, With an ivorie brest, and her haire well drest, Without gold lace or spangles. Let her foote be small, cleane leg'd withall, Her apparell not too gaudy: And one that hath not bin, in any house of sinne, Nor place that hath been baudy. Clo. But Gods me, am I trifling here with you, and dinner cooles a'the tables and I am call'd to my attendance, oh my sweet Lord Valerius! Exeunt. SENNATE. Enter Tarquin, Porsenna, Tullia, Sextus, Aruns. Tarq Next King Porsenna, whom we tender deerly, Welcome young Sextus, thou hast to our yoake, Supprest the necke of a proud nation The warlike Gabins, enemies to Rome. Sex. It was my duty Royall Emperour, The duty of a Subject and a Sonne. We at our mothers intercession likewise, Are now aton'd with Aruns whom we here receive into our bosome. Tul. This is done like a kinde brother and a naturall sonne. Aru. We enterchange a royall heart with Sextus, and graft us in your love. Tarq. Now King Porsenna, welcome once more, to Tarquin and to Rome. Por. We are proud of your alliance, Rome is ours, And we are Romes, this our religious league Shall be carv'd firme in Characters of brasse, And live for ever to succeeding times. Tar. It shall Porsenna, now this league's establisht. We will proceed in our determin'd wars, To bring the neighbour Nations under us, Our purpose is to make young Sextus Generall Of all our army, who hath prov'd his fortunes And found them full of favour: weele begin With strong Ardea, ha you given in charge To assemble all our Captaines, and take muster of our strong army? Aru. That businesse is dispatch't. Sex. We ha likewise sent for all our best commanders to take charge according to their merit: Lord Valerius, Lord Brutus, Cocles, Mutius Scevola, And Collatine to make due perparatiÃµ for such a gallant siege. Tarq. This day you shall set forward, Sextus goe, And lets us see your army march along. Before this King and us, that we may view The puissance of our host prepard already, To lay high-reard Ardea waste and lowe. Sex. I shall my Liege. Tul. Aruns associate him. Aru. A rivall with my brother in his honours. Exeunt Aruns and Sextus. Tar. Porsenna shall behold the strength of Rome, And body of the Campe, under the charge Of two brave Princes, to lay hostile siege Against the strongest Citie that withstands The all-commanding Tarquin, Pors. Tis an object to please Porsennaes eye. Soft March. Luc. The host is now upon their March. You from this place may see The pride of all the Roman Chivalry. Sextus, Aruns, Brutus, Collatine, Valerius, Scevola, Cocles, with souldiers, drum and colours, march over the stage, and congee to the King and Queene. Pors. This sight's more pleasing to Porsennaes eye, Then all our rich Attalia pompous feasts, Or sumptuous revels: we are borne a Souldier, And in our nonage suckt the milke of warre. Should any strange fate lowre upon this army Or that the mercilesse gulfe of confusion Should swallow them, we at our proper charge, And from our native confines vow supply Of men and armes to make these numbers full. Tarq. You are our Royall brother, and in you, Tarquin is powerfull and maintaines his awe. Tullia. The like Porsenna may command of Rome, Por. But we have (in your fresh varieties) Feasted to much, and kept our selfe too long From our owne seate, our prosperous returne Hath bin expected by our Lords and Peeres. Tarq. The businesse of our warres thus forwarded. We ha best leasure for your entertainment, Which now shall want no due solemnitie. Por. It hath beene beyond both expectation And merit, but in sight of heaven I sweare, If ever royall Tarquin shall demand Vse of our love, 'tis ready stor'd for you Even in our Kingly breast. Tar. The like we vow to King Porsenna, we will yet a little Enlarge your royall welcome with Rarieties, Such as Rome yeilds: that done, before we part, Of too remote Dominions make one heart. Set forward then, our sonnes wage warre abroad, To make us peace at home: we are of our selfe Without supportance, we all fate defie, Aidlesse, and of our selfe we stand thus hie. Exeunt. Two souldiers meet as in the watch. 1. Stand, who goes there? 2. A friend. 1. Stirre not, for if thou dost ile broach thee straight upon this pike. The word? 2. Sol. Porsenna. 1. Passe, stay, who walkes the round to night, The generall, or any of his Captaines? 2. Sol. Horatius hath the charge, the other Chieftaines, Rest in the Generalls tent, there's no commander Of any note, but revell with the Prince: And I amongst the rest am charg'd to attend Vpon their Rouse. 1. Sol. Passe freely, I this night must stand, Twixt them and danger, the time of night? 2. Sol. The clocke last told eleven. 1. Sol. The powers celestiall that have tooke Rome in charge, protect it still. Againe good night, thus must poore Souldiers do, Whil'st their commanders are with dainties fed, And sleepe on Downe, the earth must be our bed. Exit. A banquet prepared. Enter Sextus, Aruns, Brutus, Valerius, Horatius, Scevola, Collatine. Sex. Sit round, the enemie is pounded fast In their owne folds, the walles made to oppugne, Hostile incursions become a prison, To keepe them fast for execution; Ther's no eruption to be feared. Bru. What shall's doe? Come a health to the generalls health; and Valerius that sits the most civilly shall begin it, I cannot talke till my blood be mingled with this blood of grapes: Fill for Valerius, thou shouldst drinke wel, for thou hast beene in the German warres, if thou lov'st me drinke up se freeza. Sex. Nay since Brutus has spoke the word, the first health shall be impos'd on you Valerius, and if ever you have beene Germaniz'd, let it be after the Dutch fashion Vale. The generall may command. Bru. He may, why else is he call'd the commander? Sex. We will intreate Valerius. Vale. Since you will needs inforce a high German health, looke well to your heads, for I come upon you with this Dutch Tassaker: if you were of a more noble science then you are, it will goe neere to breake your heads round. A Dutch Song. O Mork giff men ein man, Skerry merry vip, O morke giff men ein man Skerry merry vap, O morke giff men ein man, that tik die ten long o drievan ean, Skerry merry vip, and skerry merry vap and skerry merry runke ede sunk, Ede hoore was a hai dedle downe Dedle drunke a: Skerry merry runke ede bunk, ede hoore was drunk a. O daughter yeis in alto kleene, Skerry merry vip, O daughter yeis ein alto kleene, Skerry merry vap, O daughter yeis in alto kleene, Ye molten slop, ein yert a leene Skerry merry vip, and skerry merry vap And skerry merry runk ede bunk. Ede hoore was a hey dedte downe Dedle drunke a: Skerry merry, runke ede bunk ede hoore was drunke a. Sex. Grammercies Valerius, came this hie-German health as double as his double ruffe, i'de pledge it. Brut. Where it Lubecks or double double beere, their owne naturall liquor i'de pledge it were it as deep as his ruffe: let the health goe round about the board, as his band goes round about his necke. I am no more afraid of this dutch fauchion, then I should be of the heathenish invention. Col. I must intreat you spare me for my braine brookes not the fumes of wine, their vaporous strength offends me much. Hor. I would have none spare me for Ile spare none, Collatine will pledge no health vnlesse it be to his Lucrece. Sext. What's Lucrece but a woman, and what are women But tortures and disturbance vnto men? If they be fowle th'are odious, and if faire, Th'are like rich vessels full of poysonous drugs, Or like black serpents arm'd with golden scales: For my own part they shall not trouble me. Brutus. Sextus sit fast for I proclaime my selfe a womans champion and shall unhorse thee else. Vale. For my owne part I'me a maried man, and Ile speake to my wife to thanke thee Brutus. Aru. I have a wife too, and I thinke the most vertuous Lady in the world. Sce. I cannot say but that I have a good wife too, and I love her: but if she were in heaven, beshrew me if I would wish her so much hurt as to desire her companie upon earth againe, yet upon my honour, though she be not very faire, she is exceeding honest. Bru. Nay the lesse beauty, the lesse temptation to despoile her honesty. Sce. I should be angry with him that should make question of her honour. Brut. And I angry with thee if thou shouldst not maintaine her honour. Aru. if you compare the vertues of your wives, let me step in for mine. Colla. I should wrong my Lucrece not to stand for her. Sex. Ha, ha, all captaines, and stand upon the honesty of your wives; ist possible thinke you that women of young spirit and Full age, of fluent wit, that can both sing and dance, Reade, write, such as feede well and taste choice cates, That straight dissolve to puritie of blood, That keepe the veines full, and enflame the appetite Making the spirit able, strong, and prone, Can such as these their husbands being away Emploid in forreign sieges or else where, Deny such as importune them at home? Tell me that flaxe will not be toucht with fire, Nor they be won to what they most desire? Bru. Shall I end this controversie in a word? Sex. Doe good Brutus. Bru. I hold some holy, but some apt to sinne, Some tractable, but some that none can winne, Such as are vertuous, Gold nor wealth can move, Some vicious of themselves are prone to love. Some grapes are sweet and in the Garden grow. Others unprun'd turne wilde neglected so. The purest oare containes both Gold and drosse, The one all gaine, the other nought but losse. The one disgrace, reproch, and scandall taints, The other angels and sweet featur'd Saints. Col. Such is my vertuous, Lucrece. Aru. Yet she for vertue not comparable to the wife of Aruns Sce. And why may not mine be rankt with the most vertuous? Hor. I would put in for a lot, but a thousand to one I shall draw but a blanke. Vale. I should not shew I lov'd my wife, not to take her part in her absence: I hold her inferiour to none. Aru. Save mine. Vale. No not to her. Bru. Oh this were a brave controversie for a jury of women to arbitrate. Col. Ile hazard all my fortunes on the vertues Of divine Lucrece, shall we try them thus? It is now dead of night, lets mount our steeds, Within this two houres we may reach to Rome, And to our houses all come unprepar'd, And unexpected by our hie praisd wives, She of them all that we find best imploid, Devoted, and most huswife exercisd, Let her be held most vertuous, and her husband Winne by the wager a rich horse and armour. Aru. A hand on that. Vale. Heares a helping hand to that Bargaine. Hor. But shall we to horse without circumstance? Sce. Scevola will mounted with the first. Sex. Then mount, Chevall Brutus this night take you the charge of the army, Ile see the tryall of this wager, 'twould do me good to see some of them finde their wives in the armes of their Lovers, they are so confident in their vertues: Brutus weele enterchange, good night, be thou but as provident ore the Army as we (if our horses fail not) expeditious in our journey: to horse, to horse. All. Farewell good Brutus. Exeunt. Enter Lucrece and her two maids. Luc. But one houre more and you shall all to rest: Now that your Lord is absent from this house, And that the masters eye is from his charge, We must be carefull, and with providence Guide his domestick businesse, we ha now Given ore all feasting and left revelling, Which ill becoms the house whose Lord is absent. We banish all excesse till his return, In fear of whom my soul doth daily mourn. 1 Madam, so please you, to repose your self Within your Chamber, leave us to our tasks, We will not loiter, though you take your rest. Luc. Not so, you shall not overwatch your selves Longer then I wake with you, for it fits Good huswives, when their husbands are from home, To eye their servants labours, and in care, And the true manage of his houshold state, Earliest to rise, and to be up most late. Since all his businesse he commits to me, Ile be his faithfull steward till the Camp Dissolve and he return, thus wives should do, âIn absence of their Lords be husbands too. 2 Madam, the Lord Turnus his man was thrice for you here, to have intreated you home to supper, he sayes his Lord takes it unkindle he could not have your company, Luc. To please a loving husband, Ile offend The love and patience of my dearest friend, Methinks his purpose was unreasonable To draw me in my husbands absence forth, To feast and banquet, 'twould have ill becomde me, To have left the charge of such a spacious house without both Lord and Mistresse: I am opinion'd thus: Wives should not stray Out of their doors their husbands being away: Lord Turnus excuse me. 1 Pray Madam, set me right into my work. Luc. Being abroad, I may forget the charge Imposd me by my Lord, or be compeld To stay out late, which were my husband here, Might be, without distaste, but he from hence, With late abroad, there can no excuse dispence. Here, take your work again, a while proceed, And then to bed, for whilst you sow Ile reade. Enter Sextus, Aruns, Valerius, Collatine, Horatius, Scevola. Aru. I would have hazarded all my hopes, my wife had not been so late a revelling. Vale. Nor mine at this time of night a gamboling. Hor. They weare so much Corke under their heeles they cannot choose but love to caper. Sce. Nothing does me good, but that if my wife were watching, all theirs were wantoning, and if I ha lost, none can brag of their winnings. Sex. Now Collatine to yours, either Lucrece must be better imployd then the rest, or you content to have her vertues rankt with the rest. Col. I am pleas'd. Hor. Soft, soft let's steale upon her as upon the rest, least having some watch-word at our arrivall, we may give her notice to be better prepar'd: nay by your leave Collatine, weele limit you no advantage. Col. See Lords, thus Lucrece revels with her maids, In stead of ryot, quaffing, and the practise of high lavoltoes to the ravishing sound of chambring musique, she like a good huswife is teaching of her servants sundrie chares, Lucrece? Luc. My Lord and husband welcome, ten times welcome. Is it to see your Lucrece you thus late Ha with your persons hazard left the Camp, And trusted to the danger of a night so dark, and full of horrour. Aru. Lords all's lost. Hor. By Iove ile buy my wife a wheele, and make her spin for this trike. Sce. If I make not mine learne to live by the pricke of her needle for this I'm no Roman. Col. Sweete wife salute these Lords, thy continence Hath won thy husband a Barbary horse and a rich coat of armes Luc. O pardon me, the joy to see my Lord, Tooke from me all respect of their degrees, The richest entertainement lives with us, According to the houre and the provision Of a poore wife in the absence of her husband, We prostate to you, howsoever meane, We thus excuse't, Lord Collatines away. We neither feast, dance, quaffe, riot, nor play, Sex. if one woman among so many bad, may be found good, If a white wench may prove a blacke swan, it is Lucrece, her beautie hath relation to her vertue, and her vertue correspondent to her beauty, and in both she is matchlesse. Coll. Lords will you yeild the wager? Aru. Stay, the wager was as well which of our Wives was fairest too, it stretcht as well to their beautie as to their continence, who shall judge that? Hor. That can none of us, because we are all parties, let Prince Sextus determine it who hath bin with us, and bin an eye witnesse of their beauties. Vale. Agreed. Sce. I am pleasd with the censure of Prince Sextus. Aru. So are we all. Col. I commit my Lucrece holy to the dispose of Sextus. Sex. And Sextus commits him holy to the dispose of Lucrece I love the Lady and her grace desire, Nor can my love wrong what my thoughts admire. Aruns, no question but your wife is chast, And thrifty, but this Lady knowes no waste. Valerius, yours is modest, something faire, Her grace and beautie are without compare, Thine Mutius well dispos'd, and of good feature, But the world yeilds not so divine a creature. Horatius, thine a smug lasse and grac't well, But amongst all, faire Lucrece doth excell. Then our impartiall heart and judging eyes, This verdict gives, faire Lucrece wins the prize. Col. Then Lords you are indebted to me a horse and armour. Omnes. We yeild it. Luc. Will you taste such welcome Lords, as a poore unprovided house can yeild? Sex. Gramercie Lucrece, no, we must this night sleepe by Ardea walles. Lu. But my Lords, I hope my Collatine wil not so leave his Lucrece Sex. He must, we have but idled from the Camp, to try a merry wager about their wives, &amp; this the hazard of the kings displeasure, should any man be missing from his charge: the powers that governe Rome make divine Lucrece for ever happy, good night. Sce. But Valerius, what thinkest thou of the country girles from whence we came, compar'd with our city wives whom we this night have try'd. Val. Scevola thou shall heare. The third new Song. O yes, roome for the Cryer, Who never yet was found a lyer. O ye fine smug country Lasses, That would for Brookes change christall Glasses, And be transhap'd from foot to crowne, And Straw-beds change for beds of Downe; Your Partlets turne into Rebatoes, And stead of Carrets eate Potatoes; Your Fronlets lay by, and your Rayles, And fringe with gold your daggled Tailes: Now your Hawke-noses shall have Hoods And Billements with golden Studs: Strawe-hats shall be no more Bongraces From the bright Sunne to hide your faces, For hempen smockes to helpe the Itch, Have linnen, sewed with silver stich; And wheresoere they chance to stride, One bare before to be their guide. O yes, roome for the Cryer, who never yet was found a lyer. Luc. Wil not my husband repose this night with me? Hor. Lucrece shall pardon him, we ha tooke our leaves of our wives, nor shall Collatine be before us though our Ladies in other things come behind you. Col. I must be swaid: the joys and the delights of many thousand nights meete all in one to make my Lucrece happy. Luc. I am bound to your strict will, to each good-night. Sex. To horse, to horse Lucrece we cannot rest, Till our hot lust imbosome in thy brest. Exeunt; manet Lu. Luc. With no unkindnesse we should our Lords upbraid, Husbands and Kings must alwayes be obaid. Nothing save the high busines of the state, And the charge given him at Ardeas siege, Could ha made Collatine so much digresse, From the affection that he beares his wife. But subjects must excuse when Kings claime power. But leaving this before the charme of sleepe, Cease with his downy wings upon my eyes, I must goe take account among my servants Of their dayes taske, we must not cherish sloth, No covetous thought makes me thus provident, But to shunne, Idlenesse which wise men say, Begets ranke lust, and vertue beates away. Exit. Enter Sextus, Aruns, Horatius, Brutus, Scevola, Valerius. Hor. Returne to Rome now we are in the midway to the Camp? Sex. My Lords, 'tis businesse that concernes my life. To morrow if we live weele visite thee. Vale. Will Sextus enjoyne me to accompany him? Sce. Or me? Sex. Nor you, nor any, 'tis important businesse And serious occurrences that call me, Perhaps Lords Ile commend you to your wives. Collatine shall I doe you any service to your Lucrece? Col. Onle commend me. Sex. What, no private token to purchase our kind welcom? Col, Would Royall Sextus would but honour me to beare her a slight token. Sex. What? Col. This Ring, Sex. As I am Royall I will see't delivered. This Ring to Lucrece shall my love convay, And in this gift thou dost thy bed betray. To morrow we shall meete, this night sweet fate, May I prove welcome though a guest ingrate. Exit. Aru. Hees for the Citie, we for the Camp, the night makes the way teadious and melancholly, prethee a merry song to beguile it. Song. He sings. Val. There was a young man and a maid fell in love, Terry dery ding, terry tery ding, tery tery dino. To get her good will he often did, Terry dery ding, terry dery ding langtido dille, Theres many will say, and most will allow, tery dery &amp;c. Theres nothing so good as a terry dery dery, &amp;c. I would wish all maids before they be sicke, terry dery, &amp;c. To inquire for a young man that has a good terry dery, &amp;c. Sce. Nay, my Lord, I heard them all have a conceite of an Englishman, a strange people, in the westerne Islands, one that for his variety in habit, humour and gesture, put downe all other nations whatsoever, a little of that if you love me. Valle. Well Scevola, you shall. Song. The Spaniard loves his ancient slop, The Lumbard his Venetian, And some, like breech-lesse women goe: The Russe, Turke, Iew, and Grecian, The threysly Frenchman wears small waste, The Dutch his belly boasteth: The Englishman is for them all; And for each fashion coasteth. The Turke in Linnen wraps his head, The Persian his in Lawne too. The Russe with sables furres his Cap, And change, will not be drawne too: The Spaniards constant to his blocke; The French, inconstant ever, But of all Fealts that can be felt, Give me your English Beaver. The German loves his Conny-wooll: The Irishman his Shagge-too. The Welsh his Munmouth loves to weare And of the same will bragg too: Some love the rough, and some th'smooth, Some great, and others small things, But Oh, your lecherous Englishman: Hee loves to deale in all things. The Russe drinkes quasses, Dutch, lubecks Beere. And that is strong, and mighty. The Brittaine, he Metheglen quaffes, The Irish, Aqua vitÃ¦, The French affests the Orleance Grape. The Spaniard tasts his Sherry, The English none of these can scape: But hee with all makes merry. The Italian in her high Chapeene, Scotch Lasse, and lovely Froa-too. The Spanish DonnÃ¦, French Madam: He will not feare to goe too; Nothing so full of Hazard dread. Nought lives above the Center, No Fashion, Health, no Wine, nor Wench, On which hee dare not center. Hor. Good Valerius, this has brought us even to the skirts of the campe, enter Lords, Exit. Enter Sextus and Lucrece. Luc. This Ring my Lord hath opt the gates to you, For though I know you for a Royall Prince My soveraignes Sonne, and freind to Collatine Without that key you had not entred heere. More lights and see a banquet straight provided, My love to my deere husband shall appeare In the kinde welcome that I give his friend. Sex. Not love-sicke, but love-lunaticke, love-mad: I am all fire, impatience, and my blood Boyles in my heart, with loose and censuall thoughts. Luc. A chaire for the Prince, may't please your highnes sit? Sex. Madam, with you. Luc. It will become the wife of Collatine to wait upon your trencher. Sex. You shall sit: behind us at the camp we left our state, W'are but your guest, indeede you shall not waite: Her modestie hath such strong power ore me, And such a reverence hath fate given her, brow, That it appeares a kinde of blasphemy, T'have any wanton word harsh in her eares. I cannot woo, and yet I love bove measure, Tis force not suite must purchase this rich treasuer. Luc. Your highnesse cannot taste such homely eates. Sex. Indeed I cannot feede (but on thy face, Thou art the banquet that my thoughts imbrace) Luc. Knew you my Lord, what free and zealous welcome We tender you, your highnesse would presume Vpon your entertainment: oft, and many times I have heard my husband speake of Sextus valour, Extoll your worth, prayse your perfection, to dote upon your valor, and your friendship prise next his Lucrece Sex. Oh impious lust, in all things base, respectles and unjust! Thy vertue, grace, and fame, I must enjoy, Though in the purchase I all Rome destroy. Madam if I be welcome as your vertue bids me presume I am, Carouse to me a health unto your husband. Luc. A womans draught my Lord, to Collatine. Sext. Nay you must drinke off all. Luc. Your grace must pardon the tender weaknesse of a womans braine. Sex. It is to Collatine. Luc. Me thinks 'twould ill become the modestie Of any Roman Lady to carouse, And drowne her vertues in the juice of grapes. How can I shew my love unto my husband To doe his wife such wrong? by too much wine I might neglect the charge of this great house Left soly to my keepe, else my example Might in my servants breed encouragement So to offend, both which were pardonlesse, Else to your Grace I might neglect my dutie, And slacke obeysance to so great a guest: All which being accidentall unto wine. Oh let me not so wrong my Colatine. Sex. We excuse you, her perfections like a torrent With violence breaks upon me, and at once Inverts and swallows all that's good in me. Preposterous Fates, what mischiefes you involve Vpon a Caitiffe Prince, left to the fury Of all grand mischiefe? hath the grandame world Yet smothered such a strange abortiue wonder, That from her vertues should arise my sinne? I am worst then wht's most ill depriv'd all reason My heart all fierie lust, my soule all treason. Luc. My Lord, I feare your health, your changing brow Hath shewne so much disturbance, noble Sextus, Hath not your ventrous travell from the Campe, Nor the moyst rawnes of this humorous night impaird your health? Sex. Divinest Lucrece no. I cannot eate. Luc. To rest then, a rank of torches there, attend the Prince. Sex. Madam I doubt I am a guest this night. Too trouble some, and I offend your rest. Lu. This Ring speaks for me, that next Collatine you are to me most welcome, yet my Lord thus much presume, without this from his hand, Sextus this night could not have entred here: no, not the king himselfe: My dores the day time to my friends are free, But in the night the obdure gates are lesse kinde. Without this ring they can no entrance finde. Lights for the Prince. Sex. A kisse and so goodnight, nay for your rings sake deny not that. Lu. Iove give your highnes soft and sweete repose, Sex. And thee the like with soft and sweete content, My vowes are fixt, my thoughts on mischiefe bent. Exit with torches. Luc. Tis late, so many starres shine in this roome, By reason of this great and Princely guest, The world might call our modestie in question To revell thus, our husband at the Campe, Haste and to rest; save in the Princes chamber, Let not a light appeare, my hearts all sadnesse, Iove unto thy protection I commit My chastitie and honour to thy keepe, My waking soule I give whilst my thoughts sleepe. Exit. Enter Clowne and a Servingman. Clow. Soft, soft not too loud, imagine we were now going on the ropes with egges on our heeles, he that hath but a creking shooe I would he had a creeke in is neck, tread not too hard for disturbing Prince Sextus. Ser. I wonder the Prince would ha none of us stay in his Chamber and helpe him to bed. Clo. What an asse art thou to wonder, there may be many causes: thou know st the Prince is a Souldier, and Souldiers many time want shift: who can say whether he have a cleane shirt on or no: for any thing that we know he hath us'd staves aker, or hath tane a medecine to kill the itch, what's that to us, we did our duty to proffer our selves. Ser. And what should we enter farther into his thoughts? come shalls to bed? I me as drowsie as a dormouse, and my head is as heavy as though I had a night-cap of lead on. Clow. And my eyes begin to glew themselves together, I was till supper was done all together for your repast, and now after supper I am onely for your repose: I thinke for the two vertues of eating and sleeping, there's never a Roman spirit under the Cope of heaven can put me downe. Enter Mirable. Mir. For shame what a conjuring, and catter-walling keepe you here, that my Lady cannot sleepe: you shall have her call by and by, and send you all to bed with a witnesse. Clo. Sweete Mistris Mirable we are going. Mir. You are too loud, come, every man dispose him to his rest, and ile to mine. Ser. Out with your Torches. Clow. Come then, and everyman sneake into his kennell. Exeunt. Enter Sextus with his Sword drawne and a Taper light. Sex. Night be as secret as thou art close, as close As thou art blacke and darke thou ominous Queene Of Tenebrouse silence, make this fatall houre As true to Rape, as thou hast made it kind To murder, and harsh mischiefe: Cinthia maske thy cheeke, And all you sparkling element all fires Choake up your beauties in prodigeous sogs, Or be extinct in some thicke vaporous clouds, Least you behold my practise: I am bound Vpon a blacke adventure, on a deede That must wound vertue, and make beautie bleed, Pause Sextus, and before thou runst thy selfe Into this violent danger, weigh thy sinne, Thou art yet free, belov'd, grac'd in the Campe, Of great opinion and undoubted hope, Romes darling in the universall grace, Both of the field, and senate: were these fortunes To make thee great in both, backe yet, thy same Is free from hazard, and thy stile from shame, Oh fate! thou hast usurpt such power o're man, That where thou pleadst thy will no mortall can. On then blacke mischiefe hurrey me the way, My selfe I must destroy, her life betray, The state of King and Subject, the displeasure Of Prince and people, the revenge of noble, And the contempt of base the incurd vengeance Of my wrongd kinsman Collatine, the Treason Against divin'st Lucrece: all these totall cursses Foreseene not feard upon one Sextus meete, To make my dayes harsh: so this night be sweete, No iarre of Clocke, no ominous shatefull howle Of any starting Hound, no horse-coughe breath'd from the entrals Of any drowsie Groome, wakes this charm'd silence And starts this generall slumber, forward still, Lu. discovered in her bed. To make thy lust live, all thy vertues kill. Heere, heere, behold! beneath these curtains lies That bright enchantresse that hath daz'd my eyes. Oh who but Sextus could commit such waste? On one so faire, so kinde, so truly chaste? Or like a ravisher thus rudely stand, To offend this face, this brow, this lip, this hand? Or at such fatall houres these revels keepe, With thought once to defile thy innocent sleepe, Save in this brest, such thoughts could finde no place, Or pay with treason her kinde hospitall grace; But I am lust-burnt all, bent on what's bad, That which should calme good thought, makes Tarquin mad. Madam Lucrece? Luc. Whose that? oh me! beshrew you. Sex. Sweet, tis I. Luc. What I? Sex. Make roome. Luc. My husband Collatine? Sex. Thy husband's at the Campe. Luc. Heare is no place for any man save him. Sex. Grant me that grace. Luc. What are you? Sex. Tarquin and thy friend, and must enjoy thee. Luc. Heaven such sinnes defend. Sex. Why doe you tremble Lady? cease this feare, I am alone, there's no suspicious eare That can betray this deede: nay start not sweete. Luc. Dreame I, or am I full awake? oh no! I know I dreame to see Prince Sextus so. Sweete Lord awake me, rid me from this terror, I know you for a Prince, a Gentleman, Royall and honest, one that loves my Lord, And would not wracke a woman chastitie For Romes imperiall Diadem, oh then Pardon this dream, for being awake I know Prince Sextus, Romes great hope, would not for shame Havocke his owne worth, or dispoile my fame. Sex. I'me bent on both, my thoughts are all on fire, Choose thee, thou must imbrace death, or desire. Yet doe I love thee, wilt thou accept it? Luc. No. Sex. I not thy love, thou must enjoy thy foe. Where faire meanes cannot, force shall make my way: By love I must enjoy thee. Luc. Sweet Lord stay. Sex. I'me all impatience, violence and rage. And save thy bed nought can this fine asswage: wilt love me? Luc. No, I cannot. Sex. Tell me why? Luc. Hate me, and in that hate first let me die. Sex. By Iove ile force thee. Luc. By a God you sweare, to do a devils deed, sweet Lord forbear By the same Iove I sweare that made this soule, Never to yeild unto an act so fowle. Helpe, helpe. Sex. These pillowes first shall stop thy breath, If thou but shrickest harke how ile frame thy death. Luc. For death: I care not, so I keepe unstaind The uncraz'd honour I have yet maintaind. Sex. Thou canst keepe neither, for if thou but squeakest Or letst the least harsh noise jarre in my eare, Ile broach thee on my steele, that done, straight murder One of thy basest Groomes, and lay you both Graspt arme in arme, on thy adulterate bed, Then call in witnesse of that mechall sinne, So shalt thou die, thy death be scandalous, Thy name be odious, thy suspected body Denide all funerall rites, and loving Collatine Shall hate thee even in death: then save all this, And to thy fortunes adde another friend, Give thy feares comfort, and these torments end. Luc. Ile die first, and yet heare me, as y'are noble, If all your goodnesse and best generous thoughts Be not exilde your heart, pittie, oh pity The Vertues of a woman: marre not that Cannot be made againe: this once defilde, Not all the Ocean waves can purifie Or wash my staine away: you seeke to soyle, That which the radiant splendor of the Sunne Cannot make bright againe: behold my teares, Oh thinke them pearled drops, distilled from the heart Of Soule-chast Lucrece: thinke them Orators, To pleade the cause of absent Collatine, your friend and kinsman. Sex. Tush, I am obdure. Luc. Then make my name foule, keepe my body pure, Oh Prince of Princes, do but weigh your sinne, Thinke how much I shall loose, how small you winne. I loose the the honour of my name and blood, Losse, Romes imperiall Crowne cannot make good. You winne the worlds shame and all good mens hate, Oh who would pleasure, buy at such deere rate, Nor can you terme it pleasure, for what is sweet, Where force and hate, jarre and contention meet? Weigh but for what tis that you urge me still, To gaine a womans love against her will? Youle but repent such wrong done a chast wife, And thinke that labour's not worth all your strife. Curse your hot lust, and say you have wrong'd your friends, But all the world cannot make me amends, I tooke you for a friend, wrong not my trust, But let these chaste tearmes quench your fierie lust, Sex. No, those moist teares contending with my fire, Quench not my heat, but make it clime much higher: Ile drag thee hence, Luc. Oh! Sex. If thou raise these cries, lodg'd in thy slaughtered armes some base Groome dyes. And Rome that hath admired thy name so long Shall blot thy death with scandall from my tongue. Luc. Iove guard my innocence. Sex. Lucrece th'art mine: In spight of Iove and all the powers divine. He beares her out. Enter a Servingman. Ser. What's a Clocke tro? my Lord bad me be early readie with my Gelding, for he would ride betimes in the morning: now had I rather be up an houre before my time then a minute after, for my Lord will be so infinite angry if I but over-sleepe my selfe a moment, that I had better be out of my life then in his displeasure: but soft, some of my Lord Collatines men lie in the next chamber, I care not if I call them up, for it growes towards day: what Pompey, Pompey? Clo. Who is that cals? Ser. Tis I. Clow. Whose that, my Lord Sextus his man, what a pox make you up before day? Ser. I would have the key of the Gate to come at my Lords Horse in the stable. Clo. I would my Lord Sextus and you were both in the hay-loft for Pompey can take none of his naturall rest among you; heres eene Ostler rise and give my horse another pecke of hay. Ser. Nay good Pompey helpe me to the key of the Stable. Clow. Well, Pompey was borne to do Rome good in being so kinde to the young Princes Gelding, but if for my kindnesse in giving him Pease and Oates he should kicke me, I should scarse say God a mercy horse: but come, Ile goe with thee to the stable. Exeunt Enter Sextus and Lucrece unready. Sex. Nay, weepe not sweete, what's done is past recall, Call not thy name in question, by this sorrow Which is yet without blemish, what hath past Is hid from the worlds eye, and onely private Twixt us, faire Lucrece: pull not on my head, The wrath of Rome; if I have done thee wrong, Love was the cause, thy same is without blot. And thou in Sextus hast a true friend got, Nay sweet looke up, thou onely hast my heart, I must be gone, Lucrece a kisse and part. Lu. Oh! she flings from him and Exit. Sex. No? peevish dame farewell, then be the bruter Of thy owne shame, which Tarquin would conceale, I am arm'd 'gainst all can come, let mischiefe frowne, With all his terror arm'd with ominous fate, To all their spleenes a welcome ile afford, With this bold heart, strong hand and my good sword. Exit. Enter Brutus, Valerius, Horatius, Aruns, Scevola, Collatine. Bru. What so early Valerius and your voyce not up yet? thou wast wont to be my Larke, and raise me with thy early notes. Val. I was never so hard set yet my Lord, but I had ever a fit of mirth for my friend. Bru. Prethee lets heare it then while we may, for I divine thy musique and my madnesse are both shore liv'd, we shall have somewhat else to doe ere long we hope Valerius. Hor. Iove send it. Packe clouds away, and welcome day, With night we banish sorrow, Sweete Ayre blow soft, mount Lark aloft, To give my love good morrow. Winges from the winde, to please her minde, Notes from the Larke ile borrow; Bird prune thy wing, Nightingale sing: To give my love good morrow, To give my love good morrow, Notes from them all I'ie borrow. Wake from thy nest Robin red-brest, Sing Birds in every Furrow, And from each bill, let Musicke shrill, Give my faire love good morrow, Blacke-bird and Thrush, in euery Bush, Stare, Linvet, and Cock-sparrow, You pretty elves, amongst yourselves, Sing my faire love good morrow. To giue my love good morrow, Sing Birdes in every Furrow. Bru. Me thinks our warres go not well forwards, Horatius we have greater enemies to bustle with then the Ardeans, if we durst but front them. Hor. Would it were come to fronting. Bru. Then we married men should have the advantage of the batchelers Horatius, especially such as have reveling wives, those that can caper in the Citie, while their husbands are in the Camp, Collatine why are you so sad? the thought of this should not trouble you, having a Lucrece to your bedfellow. Col. My Lord I know no cause of discontent, yet cannot I be merry Sce. Come, come, make him merry, lets have a song in praise of his Lucrece. Val. Content. The fourth new Song: In the praise of Lucrece. On two white Collomns archt she stands, Some snow would thinke them sure; Some Christall, others Lillies stript, But none of those so pure. This beauty when I contemplate What riches I behold, 'Tis rooft wit bin with vertuous thoughts, Without, 'tis thatcht with gold. Two doores thene are to enter at, The one I'le not enquire, Because conceal'd, the other seewe, Whose sight inslames desire. Whether the porch be Corrall cleer, Or with rich Crimson lin'd, Or Rose-leaves, lasting all the yeere It is not yet divin'd. Her eyes not made of purest glasse, Or Christall, but transpareth; The life of Diamonds they surpasse, Their very sight insnareth. That which without we rough-cast call, To stand 'gainst winde and weather, For' its rare beauty equalls all That I have nam'd together. For were it not by modest Art Kept from the sight of skies, It would strike dim the Sunne it selfe, And daze the gazers eyes. The Case so rich, how may we praise The jewell lodg'd within, To draw their praise I were unwise, To wrong them it were sinne. Aru. I should be frolicke if my brother were but return'd to the Camp. Hor. And in good time behold Prince Sextus. Omnes. Health to our Generall. Sex. Thank you. Bru. Will you suruey your forces, and give order for a present assault, your souldiers long to be tugging with the Ardeans. Sex. No. Col. Have you seene Lucretia my Lord, how fares she? Sex. Well, Ile to my Tent. Aru. Why how now, whats the matter brother? Exeunt the brothers. Bru. Thank you, No, well, Ile to my Tent: Get thee to thy Tent and coward goe with thee, if thou hast noe more spirit, to a speedie encounter. Vale. Shall I goe after him and know the cause of his discontent? Sce. Or I my Lord? Bru. Neither, to pursue a foole in his humor? is the next way to make him more humorous, Ile not be guiltie of his folly, thank you, no, before I wish him health agen when he is sicke of the sullens, may I die, not like a Roman, but like a runagate. Sce. Perhaps hee's not well. Bru. Well: then let him be. Vale. Nay if he be dying I could wish he were, Ile ring out his funerall peale, and this it is. Come list and harke The Bell doth towle, For some but new, Departing soule. And was not that Some ominous fowle, The Bats the Night- Crow or Skreech-Owle. To these I heare The wild-Woolfe Howle In this black night That seemes to Skowle. All these my black- Booke, shall in-rowle. For Harke, still still The Bell doth towle For some but now Departing soule. Sce. Excellent Valerius, but is not that Collatines man? Enter Clowne. Vale. The newes with this hasty post. Clo. Did no body see my Lord Collatine? oh! my Ladie commends her to you, her's a letter. Col. Give it me. Clo. Fie upon't, never was poore Pompey so over-labour'd as I have beene, I thinke I have spurd my horse such a question, that he is scarce able to wig or wag his sayde for an answere, but my Lady bad me spare for no horse flesh, and I thinke I have made him runne his race. Bru. Cosen Collatine the newes at Rome? Col. Nothing but what you all may well pertake, reade here my Lord, Brutus reades the letter. Deere Lord, if ever thou will see thy Lucrece. Choose of the friends which thou affectest best, And all important businesse set apart, Repaire to Rome: commend me to Lord Brutus, Valerius, Mutius, Horatius. Say I in treat their presence, where my Father Lucretius shall attend them, farewell sweet, Th'affaires are great, then doe not faile to meete. Bru. Ile thither as I live. Exit. Col I though I die. Exit. Sce. To Rome with expeditious wings weele flie. Exit. Hor. The newes, the newes, if it have any shape Of sadnesse, if some prodegie have have chanst, That may beget revenge, ile cease to chafe, Vex, martyr, grieve, torture, torment my selfe, And tune my humor to strange straines of mirth, My soule divines some happinesse, speake, speake: I know thou hast some newes that will create me Merrie and musicall, for I would laugh, Be new transhapt, I prethee sing Valerius that I may ayre with thee. The last new Song. [Valerius.] I'de thinke my selfe as proud in Shackles, As doth the ship in all her Tackles. The wise-man boasts no more his Braines. Then I'de insult in Gyves and Chaines: As Creditors would use there Dobters, So could I tosse and shake my Fetters, But not confesse, my thoughts should be In durance fast as those kept me. And could when spight their hurts Invirons. Then dance to th'musick of my Irons. Vale. Now tell us what's the project of thy message? Clo. My Lords, the Princely Sextus has beene at home, but what he hath done there I may partly mistrust, but cannot altogether resolve you: besides, my Lady swore me, that whatsoever I suspected I should say nothing. Val. If thou wilt not say thy minde I prethee sing thy minde, and then thou maist save thine oath. Clo. Indeed I was not sworne to that, I may either laugh out my newes or sing em, and so I may save mine oath to my Lady. Hor. How's all at Rome, that with such sad presage Disturbed Collatine and noble Brutus Are hurried from the Camp with Scevola? And we with expedition amongst the rest, Are charg'd to Rome? speake what did Sextus there with thy faire Mistresse? Val. Second me my Lord, and weele urge him to disclose it. Valerius, Horatius, and the Clowne their Catch. Val. Did he take faire Lucrece by the toe man? Hor. Toe man. Val. I man. Clow. Ha ha ha ha ha man. Hora. And further did he strive to go man? Clow. Goe man. Hor. I man. Clow. Ha ha ha ha man, fa derry derry downe ha fa derry dino. Val. Did he take faire Lucrece by the heele man? Clow. Heele man. Val. I man. Clow. Ha ha ha ha man. Hor.

Lucrece and her Maid. Luc. Mirable. Maid. Madam. Luc. Is not my father old Lucretius come yet? Maid. Not yet. Luc. Nor any from the Campe? Maid. Neither Madam. Luc. Go, begon, and leave me to the truest grief of heart, That ever entred any Matrons brest: Oh! Maid. Why weepe you Lady? alas why do you staine Your modest cheekes with these offensive teares? Luc. Nothing, nay, nothing: oh you powerfull Gods, That should have Angels guardents on your throne. To protect innocence and chastitie! oh why Suffer you such inhumane massacre On harmlesse vertue? wherefore take you charge, On sinlesse soules to see them wounded thus With Rape or violence? or give white innocence, Armor of proofe gainst sinne: or by oppression Kill vertue quite, and guerdon base transgression? Is it my fate above all other women? Or is my sinne more hainous then the rest, That amongst Thousands, millions, infinites, I, onely I, should to this shame be borne, To be a staine to women, natures scorne? oh! Maid. What ailes you Madam, truth you make me weep To see you shed salt teares: what hath opprest you? Why is your chamber hung with mourning blacke? Your habit sable, and your eyes thus swolne With ominous teares, alas what troubles you? Luc. I am not sad, thou didst deceive thy selfe, I did not weepe ther's nothing troubles me, But wherefore dost thou blush? Maid. Madam not I. Luc. Indeed thou didst, and in that blush my gilt thou didst betray How cam'st thou by the notice of my sinne? Maid. What sinne? Luc. My blot, my scandall, and my shame: Oh Tarquin, thou my honour didst betray, Disgrace no time, no age can wipe away, oh! Maid. Sweet Lady cheare your selfe, Ile fetch my Violl, And see if I can sing you fast asleepe, A little rest would weare away this passion. Luc. Do what thou wilt, I can command no more, Being no more a woman, I am now Devote to death and an inhabitant Of th'other world: these eyes must ever weepe Till fate hath closd them with eternall sleepe. Enter Brutus, Collatine, Horatius, Scevola, Valerius one way Lucretius another way. Luc. Brutus! Bru. Lucretius. Luc. Father! Col. Lucrece! Luc. Collatine! Bru. How cheare you Madam? how ist with you cousen? Why is your eye deject and drown'd in sorrow? Why is this funerall blacke, and ornaments Of widdow-hood? resolve me cousen Lucrece. Hor. How fare you Lady? Old Luc. What's the matter girle? Col. Why how is't with you Lucrece, tell me sweete? Why do'st thou hide thy face? and with thy hand Darken those eyes that were my Sonnes of joy, To make my pleasures florish in the Spring? Luc. Oh me! Val. Whence are these sighes and teares? Sce. How growes this passion? Bru. Speake Lady, you are hem'd in with your friends. Girt in a pale of safety, and environ'd And circled in a fortresse of your kindred. Let not those drops fall fruitles to the ground, Nor let your sighes adde to the sencelesse wind. Speake, who hath wrong'd you? Luc. Ere I speake my woe, Sweare youle revenge poore Lucrece on her foe. Bru. Be his head archt with gold. Hor. Be his hand arm'd with an imperiall Scepter. Old Luc. Be he great as Tarquin, thron'd in an imperiall seat. Bru. Be he no more then mortall, he shall feele The vengefull edge of this victorious steele. Luc. Then seat you Lords, whilst I expresse my wrong. Father dear husband, and my kinsman, Lords, Heare me, I am dishonour'd and disgrac'd, My reputation mangled, my renowne disparaged, but my body, oh my body. Col. What Lucrece? Luc. Stain'd, polluted, and defil'd. Strange steps are found in my adulterate bed, And though my thoughts be white as innocence, Yet is my body soild with lust-burn'd sinne, And by a stranger I am strumpeted, Ravisht, in forc'd, and am no more to rank among the Roman Matrons. Br. Yet cheere you Lady, and restraine these teares, If you were forc'd the sin concernes not you, A woman's borne but with womans strength: who was the Ravisher? Hor. I, name him Lady, our love to you shall only thus appeare in the revenge that we will take on him. Luc. I hope so Lords, 'twas Sextus the Kings Sonne. Omnes. How? Sextus Tarquin! Luc. That unprincely Prinec, who guest-wise entred with my husbands Ring, This Ring, oh Collatine! this Ring you sent Is cause of all my woe, your discontent. I feasted him, then lodg'd him, and bestowde My choisest welcome, but in the dead of night My traiterous guest came arm'd unto my bed, Frighted my silent sleepe, threatned, and praid For entertainment: I despised both. Which hearing, his sharp pointed Semiter The Tyrant bent against my naked brest, Alas, I beg'd my death, but note his tyranny He brought with him a torment worse then death, For having murdred me, he Swore to kill One of my basest Groomes, and lodge him dead In my dead armes: then call in testimonie Of my adulterie, to make me hated Even in my death, of husband, father, friends, Of Rome and all the world: this, this, oh princes, Ravisht and kild me at once. Col. Yet comfort Lady, I quit thy guilt, for what could Lucrece doe more then a woman? hadst thou dide polluted By this base scandall, thou hadst wrong'd thy fame: And hindred us of a most just revenge. All. What shall we do Lords? Bru: Lay your resolute hands upon the sword of Brutus, Vow and sweare, as you hope meed for merit from the Gods, Or feare reward for sinne, from devils below: As you are Romans, and esteeme your fame More then your lives, all humorous toyes set off. Of madding, singing, smiling, and what else, Receive your native valours, be your selves, And joyne with Brutus in the just revenge Of this chaste ravisht Lady, sweare. All. We do. Luc. Then with your humours heere my grief ends too, My staine I thus wipe off, call in my sighes, And in the hope of this revenge, forbeare Even to my death to fall one passionate teare, Yet Lords, that you may crowne my innocence With your best thoughts, that you may henceforth know We are the same in heart we seeme in show. And though I quit my soule of all such sin, The Lords whisper Ile not debare my body punishment: Let all the world, learne of a Roman dame, To prise her life lesse then her honor'd fame. Kils her selfe. Lucr. Lucrece. Col. Wife. Bru. Lady. Scov. She hath slaine her selfe. Val. Oh see yet Lords if there be hope of life, Bru. She's dead, then turne your funerall teares to fire And indignation, let us now redeeme Our mis-spent time, and over take our floath With hostile expedition, this great Lords, This bloody knife, on which her chaste blood flowed, Shall not from Brutus till some strange revenge fall on the heads of Tarquins. Hor. Now's the time to call their pride to comp, Brutus lead on, Weele follow thee to their confusion. Vale. By Iove we will, the sprightfull youth of Rome Trickt up in plumed harnesse shall attend The march of Brutus, whom we here create our Generall against the Tarquins. Sce. Be it so. Bru. We embrace it: now to stir the wrath of Rome, You, Collatine and good Lucretius, With eyes yet drown'd in teares, beare that chaste body Into the market place: that horred object, Shall kindle them with a most just revenge. Hor. To see the father and the husband mourne Ore this chaste Dame, that have so well deserv'd Of Rome and them, then to infer the pride, The wrongs and the perpetuall tyranny Of all the Tarquins, Sercius Tullius death, And his unnaturall usage by that Monster Tullia the Queene. All these shall well concurre in a combind revenge. Bru. Lucrece, thy death weele mourne in glittering armes And plumed caskes: beare that reverend loade, Vnto the Forum where our force shall meete To set upon the pallas, and expell This viperous brood from Rome: I know the people Will gladly imbrace our fortunes: Scevola, Go you and muster powers in Brutus name. Valerius, you assist him instantly, And to the mazed people freely speake the cause of this concourse. Val. We go. Exeunt. Vale. &amp; Scev. Bru. And you dear Lord, whose speechlesse grief is boundlesse. Turne all your teares with ours, to wrath and rage, The hearts of all the Tarquins shall weepe blood Vpon the funerall Hearse, with whose chast body, Honour your armes, and toth'assembled people, Disclose her innocent woundes: Gramercies Lords, A great shout and a flourish with drums and Trumpets That universal shout tels me their words Are gratious with the people, and their troopes Are ready imbatteld, and expect but us To lead them on, Iove give our fortunes speed. Weele murder, murder, and base rape shall bleed. Alarum, Enter in the fight Tarquin and Tullia flying, pursude by Brutus, and the Romans march with Drum and Colors, Porsenna, Aruns, Sextus, Tarquin, and Tullia meets and joynes with them: To them Brutus and the Romans with Drum and souldiers: they make a stand. Bru. Even thus farre Tyrant have we dog'd thy steps, Frighting thy Queene and thee with horrid steele: Tar. Lodg'd in the safetie of Porsennaes armes, Now Traytor Brutus we dare front thy pride: Hor. Porsenna th'art unworthy of a scepter, To shelter pride, lust, rape, and tyrannie, In that proud Prince and his consederate Peeres. Sex. Traytors to heaven: to Tarquin, Rome and us, Treason to Kings doth stretch even to the Gods, And those high Gods that take great Rome in charge, shall punish your rebellion. Col. Oh Devill Sextus, speake not thou of Gods, Nor cast those false and fained eyes to heaven, Whose rape the furies must torment in Hell, of Lucrece, Lucrece. Sce. Her chaste blood still cries for vengeance to the Etherial deities. Luc. Oh 'twas a soule deed Sextus. Val. And thy shame shall be eternall and out live her fame. Aru. Say Sextus lov'd her, was she not a woman, I, and perhaps was willing to be forc'd, Must you being privat subjects dare to Ring Warres loud alarum gainst your potent King? Por. Brutus therein thou dost forget thy selfe, And wrong'st the glory of thine Ancestors, stayning thy blood with Treason. Bru. Tuscan know the Consull Brutus is their powerfull foe. All Tarquine. Consull. Hor. I consull and the powerfull hand of Rome Graspes his imperiall sword: the name of King The Tyrant Tarquins have made odious Vnto this nation and the generall knee Of this our warlike people, now low bends To royall Brutus where the Kings name ende. Bru. Now Sextus wher's the Oracle, when I kist My Mother earth it plainely did foretell, My Noble vertues did thy sinne exceed, Brutus should sway, and lust burnt Tarquin bleed. Val. Now shall the blood of Servius, fall as heavie As a huge mountaine on your Tyrant heads, ore whelming all your glorie. Hor. Tullia's guilt, shall be by us reveng'd, that in her pride In blood paternall, her rough coach-wheeles di'd. Luc. Your Tyrannies: Ser. Pride. Col. And my Lucrece fate, shall all be swallowed in this hostile hate. Sex. Oh Romulus, thou that first reard yon walles In sight of which we stand, in thy softe bosome Is hugg'd, the nest in which the Tarquins build; Within the branches of thy lofty spires Tarquin shall pearch, or where he once hath stood, His high built airy shall be drown,d in blood; Alarum then Brutus by heaven I vow, My sword shall prove thou nere wast made till now. Bru. Sextus, my madnesse with your lives expires, Thy sensuall eyes are fixt upon that wall, Thou nere shall enter, Rome confines you all. Por. A charge then. Tar. Iove and Tarquin. Hor. But we crie a Brutus. Bru. Lucrece, fame and victory. Alarum, the Romans are beaten off. Alarum, Enter Brutus, Horatius Valerius, Scevola, Lucretius and Collatine. Bru. Thou Ioviall hand hold up thy Scepter high, And let not Iustice be opprest with Pride, Oh you Penates leave not Rome and us, Graspt in the purple hands of death and ruine, the Tarquins have the best. Hor. Yet stand, my foote is fixt upon this bridge; Tiber, Thy arched streames shall be chang'd crimson, with The Roman blood before I budge from hence. Sce. Brutus retire, for if thou enter Rome We are all lost, stand not on valour now, But save thy people, let's survive this day, To trie the fortunes of another field. Val. Breake downe the Bridge least the pursuing enemy Enter with us and take the spoile of Rome. Hor. Then breake behinde me, for by heaven il'e grow And roote my foote as deepe as to the center, before I leave this passage. Luc. Come your mad. Col. The foe comes on, and we in trifling heere, hazard our selfe and people. Hor. Save them all, to make Rome stand, Horatius here will fall. Bru. We would not loose thee, do not brest thy selfe 'Gainst thousands, if thou front'st them, thou art ring'd With million swords and darts, and we behind Must breake the Bridge of Tyber to save Rome. Before thee infinite gaze on thy face. And menace death, the raging streames of Tyber are at thy backe to swallow thee. Hor. Retire, to make Rome live, tis death that I desire. Bru. Then farewell dead Horatius, thinke in us The unviersall arme of Potent Rome, Takes his last leave of thee in this embrace. All embrace him. Hor. Farewell. All. Farewell. Bru. These arches all must downe to interdict their passage through the towne. Exeunt. Alarum, Enter Tarquin, Porsenna, and Aruns with their pikes and Targeters. All. Enter, enter, enter. A noise of knocking downe the bridge. within. Hor. Sofr Tarquin, See a bullwarke to the bridge, You first must passe, the man that entres here Must make his passage through Horatius brest, See with this Target do I buckler Rome, And with this sword defie the puissant army of two great Kings. Por. One man to face an host! Charge souldiers, of full forty thousand Romans Theres but one daring hand against your host, To keep you from the sacke or spoile of Rome, charge, charge. Aruns. Vpon them Souldiers, Alarum, Alarum. Enter in severall places, Sextus and Valerius above. Sex. Oh cowards slaves, and vassals, what not enter? Was it for this you plac'd my regiment Vpon a hill to be the sad spectator Of such a generall cowardise? Tarquin, Aruns, Porsenna, souldiers passe Horatius quickly, For they behind him wil devolue the bridge, And raging Tyber that's impassible, Your hoast must swimme before you conquer Rome. Val. Yet stand Horatius, beare but one brunt more, The arched bridge shall sinke upon his piles. And in his fall lift thy renown to heaven. Sex. Yet enter. Val. Dear Horatius, yet stand and save a million by one powerfull hand. Alarum, and the falling of the Bridge. Aruns and all. Charge, charge, charge. Sex. Degenerate slaves, the Bridge is falne Rome's lost. Vale. Horatius, thou art stronger then their hoste, Thy strength is valour, theirs are idle braves, Now save thy self, and leap into the waves. Hor. Porsenna, Tarquin, now wade past your depths And enter Rome, I feel my body sinke Beneath my ponderous weight, Rome is preserv'd, And now farewell; for he that follows me Must search the bottome of this raging stream, Fame with thy golden wings renowne my Crest, And Tyber take me on thy silver brest. Exit. Por. Hee's leapt off from the bridge and drownd himself. Sex. You are deceiv'd, his spirit soares too high To be choakt in with the base element Of water, lo he swims arm'd as he was, Whilst all the army have discharg'd their arrows, Of which the shield upon his back sticks full. shoot and florish. And hark, the shout of all the multitude Now welcoms him a land: Horatius fame Hath chekt our armies with a generall shame, But come, to morrows fortune must restore This scandall, which I of the Gods implore. Por. Then we must finde another time faire Prince To scourge these people, and revenge your wrongs. For this night ile betake me to my tent. A Table and Lights in the tent. Tar. And we to ours, to morrow wee'll renowne Our army with the spoile of this rich Towne. Exit Tarquin cum suis. Enter Secretary. Por. Our Secretary. Secret. My Lord. Por. Command Lights and Torches in our Tents. Enter souldiers with Torches. And let a guard ingirt our safety round, Whilst we debate of Military businesse: Come, sit and let's consult. Enter Scevola disguised. Scev. Horatius, famous for defending Rome, But we ha done nought worthy Scevola, Nor a Roman: I in this disguise Have past the army and the purssant guard Of King Porsenna: this should be his tent; And in good time, now fate direct my strength Against a King, to free great Rome at length. Secret. Oh I am slain, treason, treason. Porsen. Villaine what hast thou done? Scevo. Why slain the King. Porsen. What King? Scevo. Porsenna. Porsen. Porsenna lives to see thee tortured, With plagues more divellish then the pains of Hell. Sce. Oh too rash Mutius, hast thou mist thy aime? And thou base hand that didst direct my Poniard Against a Pesants brest, behold thy error Thus I will punish: I will give thee freely Vnto the fire, nor will I wear a limbe, That with such rashnesse shall offend his Lord. Por. What will the madman do? Sce. Porsenna so, punish my hand thus, for not killing thee. Three hundred noble lads beside my self Have vow'd to all the gods that patron Rome, Thy ruine for supporting tyranny: And though I fail, expect yet every houre, When some strange fate thy fortunes will devoure. Por. Stay Roman, we admire thy constancy, And scorne of fortune, go, return to Rome, We give thee life, and say, The king Porsenna, Whose life thou seek'st is in this honorable, Passe freely, guard him to the walls of Rome, And were we not so much ingagde to Tarquin, We would not lift a hand against that nation that breeds such noble spirits. Exit. Scev. Well. I go, and for revenge take life even of my foe. Pors. Conduct him safely: what 300 Gallants Sworne to our death, and all resolv'd like him! Weele prove for Tarquin, if they faile our hopes, Peace shall be made with Rome, but first our secretary Shall have his rights of Funerall, then our shield We must addresse next for to morrowes field. Exit. Enter Brutus, Horatius, Valerius, Collatine, Lucrece Marching. Bru. By thee we are Consull, and still govern Rome, Which but for thee, had bin dispoild and tane, Made a confused heape of men and stones, Swimming in bloud and slaughter, deare Horatius Thy noble picture shall be carv'd in brasse, And fixt for thy perpetuall memory in our high Capitoll. Hor. Great Consull Thankes, but leaving this, lets March out of the Citie. And once more bid them battell on the plaines. Val. This day my soule divines we shall live free From all the furious Tarquins: but wheres Scevola? we see not him to day? Enter Scevola. Here Lords, behold me handlesse as you see. The cause I mist Porsenna in his tent, And in his stead kild but his secretary. The moved King when he beheld me punish My rash mistake, with losse of my right hand, Vnbeg'd and almost scornd he gave me life. Which I had then refus'd, but in desire to venge faire Lucrece Rape. Soft alarum. Hor. Deare Scevola thou hast exceeded us in our resolve, But will the Tarquins give us present battell? Sce. That may ye heare, the Skirmish is begun already twixt the horse. Luc. Then noble Consull lead our maine Battell on. Bru. Oh Iove this day ballance our cause, and let her innocent bloud, destroy the heads of all the Tarquins, see this day In her cause do we consecrate our lives. And in defence of Iustice now march on: I heare their Martiall musique, be our shock As terrible as are the meeting clouds That breake in thunder, yet our hopes are faire, And this rough charge shall all our hopes repaire. Exeunt, Alarum battell within. Enter Porsenna and Aruns. Porsen. Yet grow our lofry plumes unflag'd with bloud, And yet sweet pleasure wantons in the aire: How goes the battell Aruns? Aru. Tis even balanst, I enter chang'd with Brutus hand to hand a dangerous encounter, both are wounded, and had not the rude prease divided us, one had dropt downe to earth. Por. Twas bravely fought. I saw the King your father free his person from Thousand Romans that begirt his state, where flying arrowes thick as attomes sung about his eares. Aru. I hope a glorious day, come Tuscan King let's on them. Alarum, Enter Horatius and Valerius. Hor. Aruns stay, that sword that late did drinke the Consuls bloud, must with keene phang tire upon my flesh, or this on thine. Aruns. It sparde the Consuls life to end thy dayes in a more glorious strife. Val. I stand against thee Tuscan, Por. I for thee. Hor. Where ere I finde a Tarquin he's for me. Alarum, fight, Aruns slain, Porsenna Expulst, Alarum, Enter Tarquin with an arrow in his brest, Tullia with him, pursude by Collatine, Lucretius, Scevola. Tar. Faire Tullia leave me, save thy selfe by flight, Since mine is desperate, behold I am wounded Even to the death: there stayes within my tent A winged Iennet, mount his back and fly, Live to revenge my death since I must die. Tul. Had I the heart to tread upon the bulke Of my dead father, and to see him slaughtered, Only for the love of Tarquin and a Crown, And shall I fear death more then losse of both? No, this is Tullia's fame, rather then fly From Tarquin, 'mongst a thousand swords sheel dy. All. Hew them to pieces both. Tar. My Tullia save, And ore my caitiffe head those Meteors wave. Coll. Let Tullia yeild then. Tul. Yeild me, Cuckold no; Mercy I scorne, let me the danger know. Sce. Vpon them then. Val. Let's bring them to their fate, And let them perish in the peoples hate. Tul. Fear not, Ile back thee husband. Tar. But for thee, Sweet were the hand that this charg'd soul could free, Life I despise, let noble Sextus stand To avenge our death, even till these vitals end, Scorning my own, thy life will I defend. Tul. And Ile sweet Tarquin to my power guard thine, Come on ye slaves and make this earth divine. Alarum, Tarquin and Tullia slaine. Alarum, Brutus all bloody. Brut. Aruns, this crimson favour for thy sake, Ile weare upon my forehead maskt with blood, Till all the moysture in the Tarquins veines Be spilt upon the earth, and leave thy body As dry as the parcht Summer, burnt and scorcht with the Canicular stars. Hor. Aruns lies dead, By this brigh sword that towr'd about his head. Col. And see great Consull, where the pride of Rome lies sunke and fallen. Val. Besides him lies the Queen mangled and hewn amongst the Roman Souldiers. Hor. Lift up their slaughter'd bodies, help to rear them against this hill in view of all the Camp. This fight will be a terrour to the foe, and make them yeild or fly. Bru. But wher's the Rauisher, injurious Sextus, that we see not him? Short Alarum. Enter Sextus. Sex Through broken spears, crackt swords, unboweld steeds, Flaude armors, mangled limbs, and batter'd casks, Knee deep in blood, I ha pierst the Roman host to be my Fathers rescue. Hor. 'Tis too late, his mounting pride's sunk in the peoples hate. Sex. My Father, Mother, Brother! fortune, now I do defie thee, I expose my self To horrid danger, safety I despise: I dare the worst of perill, I am bound. On till this pile of flesh be all one wound. Val. Begirt him Lords, this is the Ravisher, Ther's no revenge for Lucrece till he fall. Luc. Cease Sextus then: Sex. Sextus defies you all; yet will you give me language ere I die. Bru. Say on. Sex. 'Tis not for mercy, for I scorne that life That's given by any, and the more to adde To your immense unmeasurable hate, I was the spur unto my fathers pride, 'Twas I that aw'd the Princes of the land; That made thee Brutus mad, these discontent: I ravisht the chaste Lucrece; Sextus I, Thy daughter, and thy wife, Brutus thy Cousin, Allide indeed to all; 'twas for my Rape, Her constant hand ript up her innocent brest, 'twas Sextus did all this. Col. Which ile revenge. Hor. Leave that to me. Luc. Old as I am Ile doo'r. Sce. I have one hand left yet, of strength enough to kill a Ravisher. Sex. Come all at once, I all; yet heare me Brutus, Thou art honourable, And my words tend to thee: My father dide By many hands, What's he mongst you can challenge The least, I smallest honour in his death? If I be kill'd among this hostile throng, The poorest snakie souldier well may claime As much renowne in noble Sextus death, As Brutus, thou, or thou Horatius: I am to die, and more then die I cannot. Rob not your selves of honour in my death. When the two mightiest spirits of Greece and Troy, Tug'd for the mastry, Hector and Achillis, Had puissant Hector by Achillis hand, Dide in single monomachie, Achillis Had bin the Worthy: but being slain by odds, The poorest Mirmidon had as much honour As faint Achillis in the Trojans death. Bru. Hadst thou not done a deed so execrable That gods and men abhorre, ide love thee Sextus, And hug thee for this challenge breath'd so freely: Behold, I stand for Rome as Generall, Thou of the Tarquins doest alone survive, The head of all these garboyles, the chief actor Of that black sin, which we chastise by armes. Brave Romans, with your bright swords be our lists, And ring us in, none dare to offend the Prince By the least touch, lest he incurre our wrath: This honour do your Consull, that his hand May punish this arch-mischiefe, that the times Succeeding may of Brutus thus much tell, By him, Pride, Lust, and all the Tarquins fell. Sex. To ravish Lucrece Cuckold Collatine, And spill the chastest blood that ever ran In any Matrons vaines, repents me not So much as to ha wrong'd a Gentleman So noble as the Consull in this strife. Brutus be bold, thou sights with one scornes life. Bru. And thou with one, that lesse then his renown, Priseth his blood, or Romes imperiall Crowne. Alarum, a fierce fight with sword and target; then after pause and breathe. Bru. Sextus stand faire, much honor shall I win To revenge Lucrece, and chastise thy sin. Sext. I repent nothing, may I live or die, Though my blood fall, my spirit shall mount on hie. Alarum, fight with single swords, and being deadly wounded and panting for breath, making a stroak at each together with their gantlets they fall. Hor. Both slaine! Oh noble Brutus, this thy fame To after ages shall survive; thy body shall have a faire and gorgious Sepulchre: For whom the Matrons shall in funerall black Mourn twelue sad Moones, thou that first govern'd Rome, And swaid the people by a Consuls name. These bodies of the Tarquins weele commit Vnto the funerall pile: you Collatine Shall succeed Brutus, in the Consuls place, Whom with this Lawrell wreath we here create. Crowne him with a Lawrell. Such is the peoples voyce, accept it then. Col. We do, and may our powre so just appeare, Rome may have peace, both with our love and feare. But soft, what march is this? Florish. Porsenna, Drum, Collatine and Souldiers. Por. The Tuscan King, seeing the Tarquins slain, Thus arm'd and battell'd offers peace to Rome: To confirme which, Wele give you present hostage; If you deny, Wele stand upon our guard, And by the force of armes, maintain our own. Val. After so much efusion and large waste Of Roman blood, the name of peace is welcome: Since of the Tarquins none remain in Rome, And Lucrece Rape is now reveng'd at fall, 'Twere good to entertain Porsenna's League. Col. Porsenna we imbrace, whose Royall presence Shall grace the Consull to the funerall pile. March on to Rome, love be our guard and guide, That hath in us, veng'd Rape, and punisht Pride. Exeunt.</field>
