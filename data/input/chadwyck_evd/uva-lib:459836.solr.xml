      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. To cheat the most Judicious Eyes, there be Wayes in all Trades, but this of Poetry: Your Tradesman shews his Ware by some false Light, To hide the Faults, and slightness from your Sight. Nay, though 'tis full of Bracks, he'l boldly swear 'Tis excellent, and so help off his Ware. He'l rule your Judgement by his Confidence, Which in a Poet you'd call Impudence; Nay, if the world afford the like again, He swears he'l give it you for nothing then: Those are words too a Poet dares not say; Let it be good or bad, you're sure to pay. âWou'd 'twere a pen'worth;âbut in this you are Abler to judge then he that made the Ware: However his design was well enough, He try'd to shew some newer fashion'd Stuff. Not that the name Committee can be new, That has been too well known to most of you: But you may smile, for you have past your doom; The Poet dares not, his is still to come.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCEN. I. Enter Mrs. Day, Mrs. Arbella, Mrs. Ruth, Colonel Blunt, and a Hackney Coachman. Mrs. Day enters brushing her Hoods, and Scarfs. Mrs. Day. Now out upon't, how dusty 'tis; All things consider'd, 'tis better Travelling in the Winter; especially for us of the better sort, That ride in Coaches; and yet to say truth, warm weather is Both pleasant and comfortable: 'tis a thousand pities That fair weather should do any hurt. Well said, honest Coachman, thou hast done thy part: My son Abel Paid for my place at Redding, did he not? Coach. Yes, and please you. Mrs. Day. Well, there's something Extraordinary to make thee drink. Coach. By my Whip, 'tis a groat of more Then ordinary thinness.â [Aside. Plague on this new Gentry, how liberal they are. Farewel, Young Mistris; farewel, Gentlemen: Pray when you come by Redding let Toby carry you. [Exit Coachman. Mrs. Day. Why how now Mrs. Arbella? What, sad? why what's the matter? Arbel. I am not very sad. Mrs. Day. Nay, by my honour you need not; If you knew as much as I. Wellâ I'le tell you one thing, you are well enough, you need not fear Who ever does; say I told you so,âif you do not hurt your Self: for as cunning as he is, and let him be as cunning as He will, I can see with half an eye, that my son Abel Means to take care of you in your Composition, and will Needs have you his guest: Ruth and you shall be bed-fellows. I warrant that same Abel many and many a time Will wish his Sisters place; or else his Father ne're Got him: though I say it, that shou'd not say it, yet I do Say itâ'tis a notable fellow.â Arb. I am fallen into strange hands, If they prove as busie as her tongueâ [Aside. Mrs. Day. And now you talk of This same Abel, I tell you but one thing, I wonder that neither he nor my husbands Honours Chief Clerk Obadiah, is not here ready to attend me: I Dare warrant my son Abel has been here two hours Before us. 'Tis the veriesi princox; He will ever be a galloping, and Yet he is not full one and twenty, for all his appearances: He never stole this trick of galloping; his father Was just such another before him, And wou'd gallop with the best of 'um: he and Mistris Busies Husband were counted the best horse-men in Redding, I and Berkshiere to boot. I have rode formerly behinde Mr. Busie, But in truth I cannot now endure to travel but in a Coach; My own was at present in disorder, and so I was fain To shift in this; but I warrant you, if his Honour, Mr. Day, Chair-man of the honourable Committee of Sequestrations, Shou'd know that his Wife rode in a Stage-Coach, he Wou'd make the house too hot for some.âWhy, how is't With you, Sir? what, weary of your Journey? [To the Col. Col. Bl. Her tongue will never tireâ [Aside. So many, Mistress, riding in the Coach Has a little distemper'd me with heat. Mrs. Day. So many Sir? why there was but sixâ What wou'd you say if I should tell you, That I was one of the eleven that travell'd At one time in one Coach? C. Bl. O the devil! I have given her a new Theamâ [Aside. Mrs. Day. Why, I'le tell youâCan you guess how 'twas? C. Bl. Not I truly. But 'tis no matter, I do believe it. Mrs. Day. Look you, thus 'twas; There was, in the first place, my self, And my Husband, I shou'd have said first; but his Honour Wou'd have pardoned me, if he had heard me; Mr. Busie that I told you of, and his Wife; The Mayor of Redding, and his Wife; And this Ruth that you see there, in one of our lapsâ But now, where do you think the rest were? C. Bl. A top o'th Coach sure. Mrs. Day. Nay, I durst swear you wou'd Never guessâwhyâ Wou'd you think it; I had two growing in my belly, Mrs. Busie one in hers, and Mrs. Mayoress of Redding A chopping Boy, as it proved afterwards in hers; As like the Father as if it had been spit out of his mouth; And if he had come out of his mouth, he had come out of as honest a mans mouth as any in forty miles Of the head of him: For wou'd you think it, At the very same time when this same Ruth was sick, It being the first time the Girle was ever coach'd, The good man Mr. Mayor, I mean, that I spoke of, Held his Hat for the Girle to ease her Stomach in.â Enter Abel and Obadiah. âO are you come, Long look't for comes at last. What,âyou have a slow set pace, As well as your hasty scribble sometimes: Did you not think it fit, that I shou'd have found Attendance ready for me when I alighted. Obad. I ask your honours pardon; for I do Profess unto your Ladiship I had attended sooner, But that his young honour Mr. Abel Demurr'd me by his delayes. Mrs. Day. Well, son Abel, You must be obey'd, And I partly, if not, guess your business; Providing for the entertainment of one I have in my eye; Read her and take her: Ah, is't not so? Abel. I have not been deficient in my care forsooth. Mrs. Day. Will you never leave your forsooths, Art thou not asham'd to let the Clerk carry himself better, And shew more breeding then his Masters Son. Abel. If it please your honour, I have some business For your more private ear. Mrs. Day. Very well. Ruth. What a lamentable condition has That Gentleman been in, faith I pitty him? Arbel. Are you so apt to pitty men? Ruth. Yes, men that are humorsome, As I would children that are froward; I wou'd not make them cry a purpose. Arbel. Well, I like his humor, I dare Swear he's plain and honest. Ruth. Plain enough of all conscience; Faith I'le speak to him. Arb. Nay prethee don't, he'l think thee rude? Ruth. Why then I'le think him an ass.â How is't after your journey Sir? C. Bl. Why, I am worse after it. Ruth. Do you love riding in a Coach Sir? C. Bl. No forsooth, nor talking after riding in a Coach. Ruth. I shou'd be loath To interrupt your meditations Sir: We may have the fruits hereafter. C. Bl. If you have; they shall break loose spite of my teeth; This spawn is as bad as the great Pike. [Aside. Arbel. Prethee peace SirâWe wish you all happiness. C. Bl. And quiet good sweet Ladies,â I like her well enough.â Now wou'd not I have her say any more, for fear she Shou'd jeer too, and spoil my good opinion; If 'twere possible, I wou'd think well of one woman. Mrs. Day. Come Mrs. Arbella, 'tis as I told you, Abel has done it; say no more: take her by the hand Abel. I profess she may venter to take thee for better, for worse: Come Mrs. the honourable Committee will sit suddenly. Come, let's along. Farewel Sir. [Exeunt. C. Bl. How, the Committe ready to sit. Plague [Manet C. Blunt. On their honours; for so my honour'd Lady, That was one of the eleven, was pleas'd to call 'um. I had like to have come a day after the fair: 'Tis pretty, that such as I have been, must compound For their having been rascals. Well, I must go look a Lodging, and a Soliciter: I'le finde the arrantest rogue I can too: For according to the old saying, Set a Thief to catch a Thief. Enter Col. Careless, and Lieutenant. C. Careless. Dear Blunt, well met, When came you man? C. Bl. Dear Careless, I did not think to have met thee So suddenly. Lieutenant, your Servant; I am landed just now man. C. Car. Thou speak'st as if thou hadst been at Sea? C. Bl. It's pretty well guest, I have been in a storm. C. Car. What business brought thee? C. Bl. May be the same with yours: I am come to Compound with their Honors. C. Car. That's my business too; Why, the Committee sits suddenly? C. Bl. Yes, I know it; I heard so in the storm I told thee of. C. Car. What storm man? C. Bl. Why, a tempest as high as ever blew from Womans breath: I have rode in a Stage Coach, wedged in With half a dozen; one of them was a Committee-mans Wife; his name is Day: And she accordingly will be call'd Your Honour, and your Ladiship; with a tongue that Wags as much faster then all other womens, as in the Several motions of a Watch, the hand of the minute Moves faster then that of the hours. There was her Daughter too; but a Bastard without question; For she had no resemblance to the rest of the noch'd Rascals, and very pretty, and had wit enough To jeer a man in prosperity to death.â There was another Gentlewoman, And she was handsome, nay very handsome; But I kept her from being as sad as the rest. C. Car. Prethee, how man? C. Bl. Why, she began with two or three good words, And I desired her she would be quiet While she was well. C. Car. Thou wei't not be so mad? C. Bl. I had been mad if I had not,â But when we came to our journeys end, there met us two Such formal and stately Rascals, That yet pretended Religion, And open Rebellion ever painted: It was the hopes, And guide of the honourable Family, viz. The eldest Son, And the chiefest Clerk-roguesâ âAnd hereby hangs a tail. This Gentlewoman I told thee I kept civil, by desiring her to say nothing, Is a rich Heir of one that dy'd in the Kings service, and left his Estate under Sequestration. This young Chicken has this kite snatch'd up, And designs her for this her eldest Rascal. C. Car. What a dull fellow wer't thou, Not to make love, and rescue her? C. Bl. I'le woo no Woman. C. Car. Woud'st thou have them court thee? A Souldier, and not love a Siege! How now, who art thou? Enter Teg. Teg. A poor Irishman, and Christ save me, and save you all; I prethee give me six pence, gad mastero. C. Car. Six pence? I see thou wou'dst not lose any thing For want of asking. Here, I am pretty near, There's a groat for thy confidence. Teg. By my troth it is too little. C. Car. Troth, like enough: How long hast thou been in England? Teg. Ever since I came hither, i'faith. C. Car. That's true; what hast thou done Since thou cam'st into England? Teg. Serv'd God and St. Patrick, and my good Sweet King, and my good sweet Master; yes indeed. C. Car. And what do'st thou do now? Teg. Cry for them every day upon my soul. C. Car. Why, where's thy Master? Teg. He's dead mastero, and left poor Teg; Upon my soul, he never serv'd poor Teg so before. C. Car. Who was thy master? Teg. E'ne the good Colonel Danger. C. Car. He was my dear and noble friend. Teg. Yes that he was, and poor Tegs too, i'faith now. C. Car. What do'st thou mean to do? Teg. I will get a good master, if any good master wou'd Get me; I cannot te'l what to do else, by my soul, that I cannot; for I have went and gone to one Lilly's; He lives at that house, at the end of another house, By the May-pole-house; and tells every body by one Star, and 'tother Star, what good luck they shall have; But he cou'd not tell nothing for poor Teg. C. Car. Why man? Teg. Why, 'tis done by the Stars; And he told me there were no Stars for Irishmen: I told him he told two or three lies upon my soul; There were as many Stars in Ireland as in England, And more too, that there are; and if a good Master Cannot get me, I will run into Ireland, and see If the Stars be not there still; and if they be, I will come back i'faith, and beat his pate, If he will not, then tell me some good luck, and some Stars. C. Car. Poor fellow, I pitty him; I fancy he's simply Honest: Hast thou any trade? Teg. Bo, bub bub bo, a trade, a trade! an Irishman a trade! An Irish man scorns a trade, that he does; I will Run for thee forty miles; but I scorn t'have a trade. C. Bl. Alas, poor simple fellow. C. Car. I pitty him; nor can I indure to see any miserable That can weep for my Prince, and Friend. Well, Teg, what Sayest thou if I will take thee? Teg. Why, I will say thou wilt do very well then. C. Car. Thy master was my dear friend; wert thou with Him when he was kill'd? Teg. Yes, upon my soul, that I was, and I did houl over Him, and I ask't him why he would leave poor Teg; And i'faith I staid kissing his sweet face, till the Rogues came upon me and took away all from me; And I was naked till I got this Mantle, that I was: I have never any victuals neither, but a little snuff. C. Car. Come, thou shalt live with me; love me As thou didst thy master. Teg. That I will i'faith, if thou would'st be good too. C. Car. Now to our business; for I came But last night my self; and the Lieutenant and I Were just going to seek a Solicitor. C. Bl. One may serve us all; what say you, Lieutenant, Can you furnish us? Lieu. Yes, I think I can help you to plough With a Heifer of their own. C. Car. Now I think on't, Blunt, why didst not Thou begin with the Committee-mans Cow? C. Bl. Plague on her, she lowbell'd me so, That I thought of nothing, But stood shrinking like a dead Lark. Lieu. But hark you, gentlemen, there's an ill-tasting doze To be swallowed first; there's a Covenant to be taken. Teg. Well, what is that Covenant? By my soul I will take it for my new Master, If I cou'd, that I wou'd. C. Car. Thank thee Teg,âA Covenant, sayest thou? Teg. Well, where is that Covenant?â C. Car. We'l not swear, Lieutenant. Lieu. You must have no Land then. C. Bl. Then farewel acres, and may the dirt choak them. C. Car. 'Tis but being reduc't to Tegs equipage; 'Twas a lucky thing to have a fellow that can Teach one this cheap diet of snuff. Lieu. Come Gentlemen, we must lose no more time; I'le carry you to my poor house, where you shall lodge: For know, I am married to a most illustrious person, That had a kindeness for me. C. Car. Prethee, how didst thou light upon this good fortune? Lieu. Why, you see there are Stars in England, Though none in Ireland,: Come Gentlemen, Time calls us; you shall have my story hereafter. C. Bl. Plague on this Covenant. Lieu. Curse it not, 'twill prosper then. C. Car. Come Teg, however I have a suit of Cloathes for thee; thou shalt lay by thy Blanket For some time: It may be thee and I may be Reduc'd together to thy Country fashion. Teg. Upon my soul, joy, for I will carry thee Then into my Countrey too. C. Car. Why, there's the worst on't, The best will help it self. [Exeunt. Enter Mr. Day, and Mrs. Day. Mr. Day. Welcome sweet Duck; I profess Thou hast brought home good company indeed; Money and moneys worth: if we can But now make sure of this heir, Mrs. Arbella, For our Son Abel. Mrs. Day. If we can? you are ever at your (Ifs;) You'r afraid of your own shadow; I can tell you One (if) more; that is (if) I did not bear you up, Your heart wou'd be down in your Breeches At every turn: well,âif I were gone, There's another If for you. Mr. Day. I profess thou sayest true, I shou'd not know what to do indeed; I am beholding to thy good counsel for many Good thing; I had ne're got Ruth Nor her Estate into my fingers else. Mrs. Day. Nay, in that business too you were at Your (ifs:) Now you see she goes currantly For our own Daughter, and this Arbella shall be Our daughter too, or she shall have no estate. Mr. Day. If we cou'd but do that Wife? Mrs. Day. Yet again at your Ifs. Mr. Day. I have done, I have done; your counsel Good duck; you know I depend upon that. Mrs. Day. You may well enough, you finde The sweet on't; and to say truth, 'tis known too well, That you relied upon it: In truth they are ready To call me the Committee man: they well Perceive the weight that lies upon me Husband. Mr. Day. Nay, good duck, no chiding now, But to your councel. Mrs. Day. In the first place (observe how I lay a design In politicks) d'ye mark, counterfeit me A Letter from the King, where he shall offer you great Matters to serve him, and his Interest under-hand Very good, and in it let him remember his kinde Love and service to me: This will make them look About 'um, and think you some body: then promise them If they'l be true friends to you, to live and dye With them, and refuse all great offers, then whilst 'tis warm Get the composition of Arbella's Estate into your own power, Upon your design of marrying her to Abel. Mr. Day. Excellent. Mrs. Day. Mark the luck on't too, their names sound alike; Abel and Arbella, they are the same to a trifle, It seemeth a providence. Mr. Day. Thou observest right Duck, Thou canst see as far into a Mil-stone as another. Mrs. Day. Pish, do not interrupt me. Mr. Day. I do not good duck, I do not. Mrs. Day. You do not, and yet you do; You put me off from the concatenation of my discourse: Then, as I was saying, you may intimate To your honourable fellows, that one good turn Deserves another. That language is understood amongst you. I take it, ha. Mr. Day. Yes, yes, we use those Items often. Mrs. Day. Well, interrupt me not. Mr. Day. I do not good Wife. Mrs. Day. You do not, and yet you do; By this means get her composition put wholly into your hands, And then no Abel no Land,âbutâin the mean time I wou'd have Abel do his part too. Mr. Day. I, I, there's a want I found it. Mrs. Day. Yes, when I told you so before. Mr. Day. Why, that's true Duck, he is too backward; If I were in his place, and as young as I have been. Mrs. Day. O you'd do wonders; but now I think on't, There may be some use made of Ruth; 'Tis a notable witty harlottry. Mr. Day. You were so, when I told you I had thought on't first,âlet me see, it shall be so: We'l set her to instruct Abel in the first place; And then to incline Arbella, they are hand and glove; And women can do much with one another. Mr. Day. Thou hast hit upon my own thoughts.â Mrs. Day. Pray call her in; You thought of that too, did you not. Mr. Day. I will duck; Ruth, why Ruth. Enter Ruth. Ruth. Your pleasure Sir. Mr. Day. Nay, 'tis my Wives desire thatâ Mrs. Day. Well, if it be your Wives, she can best tell It her self I suppose: d'ye hear Ruth, you may Do a business that may not be the worse for you: You know I use but few words. Ruth. What does she call a few?â [Aside. Mrs. Day. Look you now, as I said, to be short, And to the matter, my Husband and I do design this Mrs. Arbella for our son Abel, and the young Fellow is not forward enough you conceive, prethee give Him a little instructions how to demean himself, And in what manner to speak, which we call address, To her; for Women best know what will please women; Then work on Arbella on the other side, work I say My good girle, no more but so: you know my custom Is to use but few words. Much may be said in a little, You shan't repent it. Mr. Day. And I say something too Ruth. Mrs. Day. What need you, do you not see it all Said already to your hand, what sayest thou girle. Ruth. I shall do my best.âI wou'd not lose The sport for more then I speak of.â [Aside. Mrs. Day. Go call Abel good Girle. By bringing this To pass husband we shall secure our selves If the King shou'd come; you'l be hanged else. [Exit Ruth Mr. Day. Oh good Wife, let's secure our selves By all means, there's a wise saying, 'Tis good to have a Shelter against every storm. I remember that. Mrs. Day. You may well, when you heard me say it so often. Enter Ruth with Abel. Mr. Day. O son Abel, d'ye hear. Mrs. Day. Pray hold your peace, And give everybody leave to tell their own tale.â D'hear son Abel, I have formerly told you That Arbella wou'd be a good Wife for you; A word's enough to the wise: some endeavours must Be used, and you must not be deficient. I have spoken To your sister Ruth to instruct you what to say, And how to carry your self; observe her Directions as You'l answer the contrary; be confident, and put home. Ha boy, hadst thou but thy mothers pate. Well, 'Tis but a folly to talk of that, that cannot be; Be sure you follow your sisters directions. Mr. Day. Be sure boy.â Well said duck, I say. [Exeunt. Manet Ruth and Abel. Ruth. Now Brother Abel. Ab. Now sister Ruth? Ruth. Hitherto he observes me punctually, [Aside. Have you a months minde to this Gentlewoman Mistress Arbella? Ab. I have not known her a week yet. Ruth. O cry you mercy good brother Abel. Well, to begin then, You must alter your posture, And by your grave and high demeanor make your self Appear a hole above Obadiah; lest your Mistriss Should take you for such another scribble scrabble as he is, And alwayes hold up your head as if it were Bolster'd up with high matters, your hands joyn'd Flat together, projecting a little beyond the rest of your Body as ready to separate when you begin to open. Abel. Must I go apace or softly. Ruth. O gravely by all means, as if you were loaded With weighty confiderations so.âVery well. Now to apply our prescription: Suppose now that I Were your Mistriss Arbella, and meet you by Accident; keep your posture so, and when you come Just to mee, start like a Horse that has spy'd Something on one side of him, and give a little gird Out of the way on a suddain; declaring that you Did not see her before, by reason of your deep Contemplations: then you must speak, let's hear. Abel. God save you Mistriss. Ruth. O fie man, you shou'd begin thus; Pardon Mistriss my profound contemplations, in which I was so Buried that I did not see you: And then as she answers proceed I know what she'l say, I am so us'd to her. Abel. This will do well if I forget it not. Ruth. Well try once. Abel. Pardon Mistriss my profound Contemplations, In which I was so hid, that you cou'd not see me. Ruth. Better sport then I expected. [Aside. Very well done, you'r perfect: then she will answer, Sir, I suppose you are so busied with State affairs, That it may well hinder you from taking notice Of any thing below them. Abel. No forsooth, I have some profound Contemplations, but no State Affairs. Ruth. O fie man, you must confess, that the weighty Affairs of State lie heavy upon you; but 'tis a burthen You must bear, and then shrug your shoulders. Ab. Must I say so, I am afraid my Mother will be angry, For she takes all the State matters upon her self. Ruth. Pish, did she not charge you to be rul'd by me; Why man, Arbella will never have you; If she be not made believe you can do great matters With Parliament men, and Committee men; How shou'd she hope for any good By you else in her composition. Ab. I apprehend you now, I shall observe. Ruth. 'Tis well at this time, I'le say no more; Put your self in your posture so: Now go look your Mistriss; I'le warrant you the Town's our own. Abel. I go. [Exit Abel. Ruth. Now I have fix'd him, not to go off Till he discharges on his Mistriss. I cou'd burst with laughing. Enter Arbella. Arb. What do'st thou laugh at Ruth? Ruth. Didst thou meet my brother Abel? Arb. No. Ruth. If thou hadst met him right, He had played at hard head with thee. Arb. What do'st thou mean; Ruth. Why, I have been teaching him to wooe, By command of my Superiors, and have instructed Him to hold up his head so high, that of necessity he must Run against every thing that comes in his way. Arb. Who is he to wooe? Ruth. Even thy own sweet self. Arb. Out upon him. Ruth. Nay, thou wilt be rarely courted; I'le not spoil the sport by telling thee any Thing beforehand; they have sent to Lilly And his learning being built upon knowing what most People wou'd have him say: He has told them for a certain, that Abel shall Have a rich heir, and that must be you. Arb. Must be. Ruth. Yes, Committee men can compel more then Stars. Arb. I fear this too late; You are their daughter Ruth? Ruth. I deny that. Arb. How? Ruth. Wonder not that I begin thus freely with you, 'Tis to invite your confidence in me. Arb. You amaze me. Ruth. Pray do not wonder, nor suspect,â When my Father Sir Basil Throughgood dyed, I was Very young, not above two years old: 'tis too long To tell you how this rascal being a Trustee, Catch'd me and my estate, being the sole heir unto my Father into his gripes; and now for some years Has confirm'd his unjust power by the unlawful Power of the times: I fear they have designs as bad as This on you: You see I have no reserve, and endeavour To be thought worthy of your friendship. Arb. I embrace it with as much clearness, Let us love and assist one another.â Wou'd they marry me to this their first born puppy. Ruth. No doubt, or keep your composition from you. Arb. 'Twas my ill fortune to fall into such hands, Foolishly enticed by fair words and Large promises of assistance. Ruth. Peace. Enter Obadiah. Obad. Mrs. Ruth, my Master is demanding your company, Together, and not singly, with Mrs. Arbella; You will finde them in the Parlor: The Committee being ready to sit, Calls upon my care and circumspection to set in order The weighty matters of State, For their wise and honourable inspection. [Exit. Ruth. We come; come dear Arbella, never be perplex'd, Chearful spirits are the best bladders to swim with: If thou art sad, the weight will sink thee: Be secret, and still know me for no other then what I seem to be, their daughter. Another time Thou shalt know all particulars of my strange story. Arb. Come wench, they cannot bring us to compound For our humors; they shall be free still. [Exeunt.</field>

I'faith my sweet Master has sent me to a Rascal, now that he has; I will go tell him so too: He ask'd me why he could not sent one That cou'd speak English. Upon my soul I was going To give him an Irish knock; the Devil's in them all, They will not talk with me; I will go near to Knock this mans pate, and that man Lillie's [One cryes Books within. Enter Pate too,âthat I will: I will make them Prate to me, that I will. How now, What noises are that.â Book-sel. New Books, new Books, a desperate Plot And Ingagement of the bloody Cavaliers: One cryes Books without Mr. Saltmarshes Alarum to the Nation, after having Been three dayes dead, Mercurius Britanicus, &amp;c. Teg. How's that? now they cannot live in Ireland After they are dead three dayes! Book-sel. Mercurius Britanicus, or the Weekly Post, Or, The Solemn League and Covenant. Teg. What is that you say? Is it the Covenant, have you that? Book-sel. Yes, what then Sir. Teg. Which is that Covenant? Book-sell. Why, this is the Covenant. Teg. Well, I must take that Covenant. Book-sell. You take my Commodities? Teg. I must take that Covenant upon my soul now, that I must. Book-sell. Stand off Sir, or i'le set you further. Teg. Well, upon my soul now I will take That Covenant for my Master. Book-sel. Your Master must pay me for't then? Teg. Ifaith now, they will make him pay for't After I have taken it for him. Book-sell. What a devil does the fellow mean? Teg. You will make me stay too long, that you will; Look you now, I will knock you down upon the ground If you will not let me take it? Book-sell. Stand off Sirrah. Teg. Ifaith I will take it now. He throws the fellow down, and takes away the Paper, and runs out. Book-sell. What a Devil ailes this fellow? He did not come to rob me certainly For he has not taken above two Penniworth of lamentable ware away; But I feel the rascals fingers; I may light Upon my wilde Irish again, and if I do, I will fix him with some Catchpoles that shall Be worse then his own Countrey Bogs. Enter C. Careless, C. Blunt, and Lieutenant Story. Lieu. And what say you noble Colonels, how and how D'ye like my Lady; I gave her the title of Illustrious From those illustrious commodities which she deals in Hot Water, and Tobacco. C. Car. Prethee how com'st thou to think of marrying? Lieu. Why that which hinders men from those Venereal conditions, prompted me to Matrimony, Hunger and cold, Colonel. C. Car. Which you destroyed with a fat Woman, Strong Water, and stinking Tobacco. Lieu. No faith, the woman conduc'd but little, But the rest cou'd not be purchas'd without. C. Car. She's beholding to you. Lieu. For all your mocking she had been ruin'd If it had not been for me. C. Car. Prethee make but that good? Lieu. With ease Sir, why look you,âyou must Know she was alwayes a most violent Cavalier, And of a most ready and large Faith; abundance of Rascals had found her soft place, and perpetually Wou'd bring her news, news of all prizes, They wou'd tell her news from half a Crown, to a Gill of hot Water, or a pipe of the worst Mundungo: I have observ'd their usual rates; they wou'd borrow Half a Crown upon a story of five thousand men up In the North; a shilling upon a Towns revolting, Six pence upon a small Castle, and consume hot Water And Tobacco, whilst they were telling news of Arms, Convey'd into several parts, and Ammunition hid In Cellars; that at the last, if I had not married, And blown off these flyes, she had been absolutely consum'd. C. Car. Well Lieutenant, we are beholding to you For these hints; we may be reduc'd to as bad: See Where Teg comes. Goodness, how he smiles. [Enter Teg smiling Why so merry Teg? Teg. I have done one thing for thee now, that I have indeed. C. Car. What hast thou done man? Teg. I have taken the Covenant for thee, That I have upon my soul. C. Car. Where hadst it thou? Teg. Hadst it thou; I threw a fellow down, that I did, And took it away for thy sweet sake; here it is now. C. Car. Was there ever such a fancy? why didst thou think This was the way to take the Covenant. Teg. Ay, upon my soul that it is; look you there now Have not I taken it; is not this the Covenant, Tell me that then I prethee. C. Bl. I am pleased yet, With the poor fellows mistaken kindeness; I dare warrant him honest to the best of his understanding. C. Car. This fellow I prophesie will bring me into Many troubles by his mistakes: I must send him on No errand but how d'ye; and to such as I wou'd have No answer from again:âYet his simple honesty Prevails with me, I cannot part with him. Lieu. Come Gentlemen, some calls; how now, who's this. Enter Obadiah, with four persons more with papers. C. Car. I am a rogue if I have not seen a picture In hangings walk as fast. C. Bl. 'Slife man, this is that good of the Committee Family that I told thee of, the very Clerk; How the rogue's loaded with papers; Those are The winding sheets to many a poor Gentlemans Estate: 'Twere a good deed to burn them all. C. Car. Why, thou art not mad, art: well met Sir; Pray do not you belong to the Committe of sequestrations? Obad. I do belong to that honourable Committee, Who are now ready to sit for the bringing on the work. C. Bl. O plague, what work rasâ C. Car. Prethee be quiet man; are they to sit presently? Obad. As soon as I can get ready, my presence being material. [Exit C. Car. What, wert thou mad; wou'dst thou have beaten The Clerk when thou wert going to compound With the rascals his Masters. C. Bl. The sight of any of the villains stirs me. Lieu. Come Colonels, there's no trifling; Let's make haste, and prepare your business, let's not lose This sitting, come along, along. [Exeunt. Enter Arbella at one door, Abel at another, as if he saw her not, and starts when he comes to her as Ruth had taught him. Arb. What's the meaning of this, I'le try to steal by him. Abel. Pardon Mistriss my profound contemplations, In which I was so hid that you cou'd not see me. Arb. This is a set form,âthey allow it In every thing but their prayers. Abel. Now you shou'd speak forsooth. Arb. Ruth I have found you; But I'le spoil the dialogue. [Aside. âWhat shou'd I say Sir? Abel. What you please forsooth. Arb. Why, truly Sir, 'tis as you say; I did not see you. Enter Ruth as over-hearing them, and Peeps. Ruth. This is lucky. Abel. No forsooth, 'twas I that was not to see you. Arb. Why Sir, wou'd your Mother be angry if you shou'd? Abel. No, no, quite contrary,âI'le tell you that presently; But first I must say, that the weighty affairs lie Heavy upon my neck and shoulders. [Shrugs Arb. Wou'd he were ty'd neck and heels? [Aside This is a notable wench; look where the rascal peeps too; If I shou'd becken to her she'd take no notice; She's resolv'd not to relieve me. [Aside. Ab. Something I can do, and that with some body; That is, with those that are some bodies. Arb. Whist, whist, Beckons to Ruth, and she shakes her head. Prethee have some pitty? O unmerciful girle. Abel. I know Parliament men, and Sequestrators; I know Committee men, and Committee men know me. Arb. You have great acquaintance Sir? Abel. Yes, they ask my opinion sometimes. Arb. What weather 'twill be; have you any skill Sir? Abel. When the weather is not good, we hold a fast. Arb. And then it alters. Abel. Assuredly. Arb. In good timeâno mercy wench. Ab. Our profound contemplations, Are caused by the constervation of our spirits For the Nations good, we are in labour. Arb. And I want a deliverance. Hark ye Ruth, Take off your Dog, or i'le turn Bear indeed. Ruth. I dare not, my mother will be angry. Arb. O hang you. Ab. You shall perceive that I have some power, If you please to.â Arb. O I am pleased! Sir, that you shou'd have power; I must look out my Hoods and Scarfs Sir, 'tis a most time to go. Ab. If it were not for the weighty matters of State Which lie upon my shoulders, my self wou'd look them. Arb. O by no means Sir, 'tis below your greatness: Some luck yet; she never came seasonably before. Enter Mrs. Day. Mrs. Day. Why how now, Abel got so close to Mrs. Arbella, So close indeed; nay then I smell something: Well Mr. Abel, you have been so us'd to secresie, In Council and weighty matters, that you have it At your fingers ends: Nay, look ye Mistriss, look ye, Look ye; mark Abels eyes: ah, there be looks. Ruth thou art a good Girle, I finde Abel has got ground. Ruth. I forbore to come in, till I saw your honour First enter; but I have o're heard all. Mrs. Day. And how has Abel behav'd himself wench, ha? O beyond expectation: if it were lawful, I'de undertake He'd make nothing to get as many womens good Wills as he speaks to; he'l not need much teaching, You may turn him loose. Arb. O this plaguy wench! Mrs. Day. Sayest thou so girle, it shall be something In thy way; a new Gown, or so, it may be a better penny: Well said Abel, I say, I did think thou wou'dst come Out with a piece of thy Mothers at last:â But I had forgot, the Committee are near upon sitting. Ha, Mrs. you are crafty; you have made your Composition before-hand. Ah, this Abel's as bad As a whole Committee: Take that Item from me; Come, make haste, call the Coach Abel; well said Abel I say. Arb. We'l fetch our things and follow you. [Exit Mrs. Day and Abel. Now wench, canst thou ever hope to be forgiven: Ruth. Why, what's the matter? Arb. The matter; coud'st thou be so unmerciful, To see me practic'd on, and pelted at, by a Blunderbuss Charg'd with nothing but proofs, weighty affairs, Spirit, profound contemplation, and such like. Ruth. Why, I was afrad to interrupt you; I thought It convenient to give you what time I cou'd, To make his young honour your friend. Arb. I am beholding to you, I may cry quittance. Ruth. But did you mark Abels eyes? Ah, there were looks! Arb. Nay, prethee give off, my hours approaching, And I cann't be heartily merry till it be past: Come, let's fetch our things, Her Ladiships honour will stay for us. Ruth. I'le warrant ye my brethren, Abel is not in order yet, He's brushing a hat almost a quarter of an hour, And as long a driving the lint from his black Cloathes, With his wet Thumb. Arb. Come prethee hold thy peace, I shall laugh in's face else when I see him come along: Now for an old shooe. [Exeunt. A Table set out. Enter the Committee as to sit, and Obadiah ordering Books and Paper. Obad. Shall I read your Honors last Order, and give you The account of what you last debated? Mr. Day. I first crave your favours to communicate an Important matter to this honourable board, In which I shall Discover unto you my own sincerity And zeal to the good Cause. 1. Proceed Sir. Mr. Day. The business is contained in this Letter, 'tis from No less a man then the King; and 'tis to me, as simple as I sit Here: Is it your pleasures that our Clerk should read it? 2. Yes, pray give it him. Obad. Mr. Day, [Reads. We have received good intelligence of your great worth, And ability, especially in State matters; and therefore thought Fit to offer you any preferment, or honor, that you shall desire, If you will become my intire friend: Pray remember my Love and Service to your discreet Wife, and acquaint her With this; whose wisdom I hear is great: so recommending This to her and your wise consideration, I remain Your Friend, C. K. 2. C. K. Mr. Day. I, that's for the King. 2. I suspect who brought you this Letter. Mr. Day. O fie upon't, my Wife forgot that particular.â Why, a fellow left it for me, and shrunk away when he had Done, I warrant you he was afraid I shou'd have laid hold On him: You see Brethren what I reject; but I doubt not But to receive my reward: and I have now a business To offer, which in some measure may afford you an occasion. 2. This Letter was counterfeited certainly. Mr. Day. But first be pleased to read your last order. 2. What does he mean that concerns me? Obad. The order is, that the Composition arising out of Mr. Lashleys Estate, be and hereby is invested and allow'd to The honorable Mr. Nathaniel Catch, For and in respect of his sufferings and good service. Mr. Day. It is meet, very meet, we are bound In duty to strengthen our selves against the day of trouble, When the common Enemy shall endeavour to raise Commotions in the Land, And disturb our new built Zion. 2. Then I'le say nothing, but close with him, we must Wink at one another; I receive your sense Of my services with a zealous kindness. Now Mr. Day, I pray you propose your business. Mr. Day. I desire this honourable Board to understand, That my Wife being at Redding, and to come up in The Stage Coach: It happened that one Mrs Arbella, A rich heir of one of the Cavalier Party, came up also in The same Coach; her father being newly dead, and her Estate before being under Sequestration: My Wife, who Has a notable pate of her own; you all know her; Presently cast about to get her for my son Abel; And accordingly invited her to my house; where, though Time was but short, yet my son Abel made use of it: They are without, as I suppose; but Before we call them in, I pray let us handle Such other matters as are before us. 1. Let us hear then what Estates besides Lies before us, that we may see how large a Field we have to walk in. 2. Read. Obad. One of your last Debates was upon the plea Of an infant, whose Estate is under Sequestration. Mr. Day. And fit to be kept so till he comes of age, And may answer for himself; that he may not Be in possession of the Land till he can promise He will not turn to the Enemy. Obad. Here is another of almost the like nature; An Estate before your Honors under Sequestration: The plea is, that the party died without anyâ For taking up Armes; but in his opinion for the King: He has left his Widow with childe, which will Be the Heir; and his Trustees complain of wrong, And claim the Estate. 2. Well, the Father in his opinion was a Cavalier. Obad. So it is given in. 2 C. Nay, 'twas so I warrant you, and there's a young Cavalier in his Widows Belly; I warrant you that too; For the perverse generation encreaseth; I move Therefore that their two Estates may remain in the hands Of our Brethren here, and fellow labourers, Mr. Joseph Blemish, and Mr. Jonathan Headstrong, And Mr. Ezekiel Scrape, and they to be accountable At our pleasures; whereby they may have a godly Opportunity of doing good for themselves. Mr. Day. Order it, order it. 3. Since it is your pleasures, we are content To take the burthen upon us, and be Stewards to the Nation. 2. Now verily it seemeth to me That the work goeth forward, when Brethren Hold together in unity. Mr. Day. Well, if we have now finish'd, give me leave To tell you, my Wife is without, together with The Gentlewoman that is to compound: She will Needs have a finger in the pie. 3. I profess we are to blame to let Mrs. Day wait so long. Mr. Day. We may not neglect the publick for private Respects. I hope Brethren, that you please to cast the Favour of your countenances upon Abel. 2., 3. You wrong us to doubt it, Brother Day, Call in the Compounders. Enters Mrs. Day, Abel, Arbella, Ruth, and after them the Colonels, and Teg; they give the door-keeper something, who seems to scrape. Mr. Day. Come duck, I have told the honourable Committee That you are one that will needs endeavour To do good for this Gentlewoman. 2. We are glad, Mrs. Day, that any occasion brings you hither. Mrs. Day. I thank your honors? I am desirous of doing Good, which I know is alwayes acceptable in your eyes. Mr. Day. Come on son Abel, what have you to say? Abel. I come unto your Honors, full of profound Contemplations for this Gentlewoman. Arb. 'Slife, he's at's lessen, wench. Ruth. Peace, which whelp opens next? O the Wolf is going to bark. Mrs. Day. May it please your Honors, I shall presume To inform you, that my son Abel has settled his affections On this Gentlewoman, and desires your honours favour To be shewn unto him in her Composition. 2 C. Say you so Mrs. Day? why the Committee have taken It into their serious, and pious consideration; together With Mr. Dayes good service, upon some knowledge That is not fit to communicate. Mrs. Day. That was the Letter I invented. [Aside. 2 C. And the composition of this Gentlewoman is consign'd To Mr. Day, that is, I suppose to Mr. Abel, and so consequently To the Gentlewoman. You may be thankful Mistress. For such good fortune, your Estate's discharg'd, Mr. Day shall have the discharge. C. Bl. O dam the vultures! C. Care. Peace man. Arb. I am willing to be thankful when I understand the Benefit. I have no reason to compound for what's my own; But if I must, if a woman can be a Delinquent, I desire to know my publick censure, Not be left in private hands. 2 C. Be contented Gentlewoman, the Committee does this In favour of you; we understand how easily you Can satisfie Mr Abel; you may if you please by Mrs. Day. Ruth. And then good night to all. [Aside Arb. How Gentlemen, are you private marriage jobbers, D'ye make markets for one another? 2 C. How's this Gentlewoman? C. Bl. A brave noble creature. C. Car. Thou art smitten Blunt; that other female too, Methinks shoots fire this way. Mrs. Day. I desire your honours to pardon Her incessant words; perhaps she doth not imagine The good that is intended her? 2 C. Gentlewoman, the Committee for Mrs. Dayes sake Passes by your expressions; you may spare your pains, You have the Committees resolution, you may Be your own enemy if you will. Arb. My own enemy. Ruth. Prethee peace, 'tis to no purpose to wrangle here; We must use other wayes. 2 C. Come on Gentlemen, what's your case? Ruth. Arbella, there's the down right Cavalier That came up in the Coach with us. âOn my life there's a sprightly Gentleman with him. C. Care. Our business is to compound for our Estates While they speak, the Colonels pull the papers out and delivers 'um. Of which here are the particulars, Which will agree with your own Survey. Obad. The particulars are right. Mr. Day. Well Gentlemen, the rule is two years purchase, The first payment down, the other at six months end, And the estate to secure it. C. Car. Can yon afford it no cheaper? 2 C. 'Tis our rule. C. Car. Very well, 'tis but selling the rest to pay this, And our more lawful debts. 2. But Gentlemen, before you are admitted, You are to take the Covenant; You have not taken it yet, have you. C. Car. No. Teg. Upon my soul but he has now; I took it for him, And he has taken it from me, that he has. Ruth. What sport are we now like to have? 2 C. What fellow's that? C. Car. A poor simple fellow that serves me. Peace Teg. Teg. Let them not prate so then. 2 C. Well Gentlemen, it remains Whether you'l take the Covenant? C. Car. This is strange, and differs from your own principle, To impose on other mens consciences. Mr. Day. Pish, we are not here to dispute, we act According to our instructions, and we cannot admit any To compound without taking it; therefore your answer. Teg. Why was it for no matter then that I have taken The Covenant. You there, Mr. Committee. Do you hear that now? C. Car. No, we will not take it, much good may it do them That have swallows large enough; 'Twill work one day in their stomachs. C. Bl. The day may come, when those that suffer for their Consciences and honour may be rewarded. Mr. Day. I, I, you make an idol of that honour. C. Bl. Our worships then are different, you make that Your idol which brings your interest; We can obey that which bids us lose it. Arb. Brave Gentlemen. Ruth. I stare at 'um till my eyes ake. 2 C. Gentlemen, you are men of dangerous spirits, Know, we must keep our rules, and instructions, lest we Lose what providence hath put into our hands. C. Care. Providence, such as thieves rob by? 2. C. What's that, Sir, Sir, you are too bold? C. Car. Why in good sooth you may give losers Leave to speak; I hope your honors out of your bowels of Compassion will permit us to take over our departing acres. Mr. Day. It is well you are so merry. C. Car. O ever whilst you live, clear souls make light hearts; Faith, wou'd I might ask one question? 2 C. Swear not then. C. Car. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours goods; There's a Rowland for your Oliver; my question is only, Which of all you is to have our Estates: or will you Make traytors of them, draw 'um, and quarter them. 2 C. You grow abusive. C. Bl. No, no, 'tis only to entreat the honorable persons That will be pleased to be our house-keepers, to keep them In good reparations; we may take possession again Without the help of the Covenant. 2 C. You will think better on't, and take this Covenant. C. Car. We will be as rotten first as their hearts That invented it. Ruth. 'Slife Arbella, we'l have these two men; There are not two such again, to be had for love nor mony. Mr. Day. Well Gentlemen, your follies light upon your Own heads; we have no more to say. C. Car. Why then hoist sayles for a new world: D'hear Blunt, what Gentlewoman is that. C. Bl. 'Tis their witty daughter I told thee of. C. Car. I'le go speak to 'um, I'de fain convert That pretty Covenanter. C. Bl. Nay, prethee let's go. C. Car. Lady, I hope you'l have that good fortune, Not to be troubled with the Covenant. Arb. If they do, I'le not take it. C. Bl. Brave Lady, I must love her against my will. C. Car. For you pretty one, I hope your portion will Be enlarged by our misfortunes; remember your benefactors. Ruth. If I had all your Estates, I cou'd afford you as good a thing. C. Car. Without taking the Covenant? Ruth. Yes, but I would invent an other oath. C. Car. Upon your lips. Ruth. Nay, I am not bound to discover. C. Bl. Prethee come, is this a time to spend in fooling? C. Car. Now have I forgot every thing. C. Bl. Come, let's go. 2. Gentlemen, void the room. C. Car. Sure 'tis impossible that Kite Shou'd get that pretty Merlin. C. Bl. Come, prethee let's go; these muck-worms will have Earth enough to stop their mouths with one day. C. Car. Pray use our Estates husband-like, and so our Most honourable Baliffs farewel. Mr. Day. You are rude: Door-keeper, put 'um forth there. Keeper. Come forth ye there, this is not a place for such as you. Teg. Ye are a rascal, that you are now. Keep. And please your honors, this profane Irish-man swore An oath at the door, even now, when I Wou'd have put him out. 2 C. Let him pay for't. Keep. Here, you must pay, or lie by the heels. Teg. What must I pay, by the heels? I will not pay by The heels, that I will not, upon my soul. C. Car. Here, here's a shilling for thee, be quiet.â [Exeunt. Teg. Well, I have not curs'd you now, that I have not: What if I had cursed then? Keeper. That had been six-pence. Teg. Upon my soul now I have but one six pence that I Have not: here though, I will give it thee for a Curse; there Mr. Committee, now there is six pence for the Curse beforehand Mr. Committee, and a plague take you all. [Runs out. Ruth. Hark ye Arbella, 'twere a sin not to love these men. Arb. I am not guilty Ruth. Mrs. Day. Has this honorable board any other command. 2 C. Nothing farther good Mrs. Day: Gentlewoman You have nothing to care for, but be grateful And kind to Mr. Abel. Arb. I desire to know what I must directly trust to, Or I will complain. Mrs. Day. The Gentlewoman needeth not doubt, she shall Suddenly perceive the good that is intended her, If she does not interpose in her own light. Mr. Day. I pray withdraw; the Committee has pass'd their Order, and they must now be privateâ 2 Com. Nay, pray Mistress withdrawâSo, Brethren, we have Finish'd this days work; and let us always keep The bonds of Unity unbroken, Walking hand in Hand, and scattering the Enemy. Mr. Day. You may perceive they have spirits never to be Reconcil'd; they walk according to Nature, and are Full of inward darkness. 2 Com. It is well truly for the good people that they Are so obstinate, whereby their Estates may Of right fall into the hands of the Chosen, which Truly is a mercy. Mr. Day. I think there remaineth nothing farther, But to adjourn till Munday: Take up the Papers there, and bring home to me their Honours Order for Mrs. Arbella's Estate: So, Brethren, we seperate our selves to our Particular endeavors, till we join in Publick on Munday, two of the Clock; And so Peace remain with you. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. SCEN. I. Col. Careless, Col. Blunt, and Lieutenant. Lieu. By my faith a sad story: I did apprehend this Covenant Wou'd be the trap. C. Car. Never did any Rebels fish with such Cormorants; no Stoppage about their throats; the Rascals are all swallow. C. Bl. Now am I ready for any Plot; I'le go find some of these Agitants, and fill up a blank Commission with my Name. And if I can but find two or three gather'd together, They are sure of me; I will please my self, however, With endeavouring to cut their throats. C. Car. Or do somthing to make them hang us, that we may But part on any terms: Nothing anger'd me but that My old Kitchen-stuff-acquaintance look'd another Way and seem'd not to know me. C. Bl. How, Kitchen-stuff-acquaintance! C. Car. Yes, Mrs. Day that commanded the Party in the Hackney-Coach, was my Father's Kitchen-maid, and in Time of yore called Gillian. How now, Teg? [Enter Teg. What says the Learned? Teg. Well then, upon my Soul, the man in the great Cloak, with the long sleeves, is mad, that he is. C. Car. Mad, Teg! Teg. Yes i'faith is he; he bid me be gone, and said I was sent To mock him. C. Car. Why, what didst thou say to him? Teg. Well now, I did ask him if he wou'd take any Counsel. C. Car. 'Slife, he might well enough think thou mock'st him. Why, thou shou'dst have ask'd him when we might have Come for Counsel. Teg. Well, that is all one, is it not? If he wou'd take any Counsel, or you wou'd take any Counsel, is not that all one then? C. Car. Was there ever such a mistake? C. Bl. Prethee ne're be troubled at this; we are past Counsel: If we had but a Friend amongst them, that cou'd but slide Us by this Covenant. Lieut. Hark ye, Colonel; what if you did visit this translated Kitchen-maid? Teg. Well, how is that? a Kitchen-maid? where is she now? C. Bl. The Lieutenant advises well. C. Car. Nay, stay, stay; in the first place I'le send Teg to her To tell her I have a little business with her, and desire To know when I may have leave to wait on her. C. Bl. We shall have Teg mistake agen. Teg. How is that so? I will not mistake that Kitchen-maid. Whither must I go now, to mistake that Kitchen-maid? C. Car. But d'hear, Teg? you must take no notice of that, upon Thy life; but on the contrary, at every word you must say, Your Ladiship, and your Honor; as for example, when you have Made a leg, you must begin thus; My Master presents His service to your Ladiship, and having some business with Your Honour, desires to know when he may have leave To wait upon your Ladiship. Teg. Well, that I will do: But was she Your Fathers Kitchen-maid? C. Car. Why, what then? Teg. Upon my Soul I shall laugh upon her face, for all I wou'd not have a mind to do it. C. Car. Not for a hundred pounds, Teg; you must be sure to Set your Countenance, and look very soberly before you begin. Teg. If I shou'd think then of any Kettles, or Spits, or Any thing that will put a mind into my head of a Kitchen, I shou'd laugh then, shou'd I not? C. Car. Not for a thousand pounds, Teg; thou maist undo us all. Teg. Well, I will hope I will not laugh then? I will Keep my mouth if I can, that I will, from running To one side, and 'tother side: well now, where does This Mrs. Tay live? Lieu. Come Teg, I'le walk along with thee, and shew thee The house, that thou mayest not mistake that however. [Exeunt Lieutenant and Teg. C. Car. Prethee do Lieutenant, have a care Teg, Thou shalt finde us in the Temple. Now Blunt have I Another design. C. Bl. What further design canst thou have? C. Car. Why by this means I may chance see these women Again, and get into their acquaintance. C. Bl. With both man? C. Car. 'Slife thou art jealous, do'st love either of 'um? C. Bl. Nay, I can't tell, all is not as 'twas. C. Car. Like a man that is not well, and yet knows Not what ailes him. C. Bl. Thou art something near the matter; but I'le Cure my self with considering, that no woman can Ever care for me. C. Car. And why prethee? C. Bl. Because I can say nothing to them. C. Car. The less thou canst say, they'l like thee the better; Shee'l think 'tis Love that has ham-string'd thy tongue: Besides man, a woman can't abide that any thing In the house shou'd talk, but she and her Parat; What, 'tis the Cavalier girle thou lik'st? C. Bl. Canst thou love any of the other Breed. C. Car. Not honestly,âyet I confess that ill-begotten Pretty Rascal, never look'd towards me, but She scatter'd sparks as fast as kindling Charcoale; Thine's grown already to an honest flame: Come Blunt, when Teg comes we will resolve on somthing. [Exeunt. Enter Arbella and Ruth. Arb. Come now, a word of our own matters; how do'st Thou hope to get thy Estate again. Ruth. You shall drink first; I was just going to ask you, How you would get yours again; you are as fast as if You were under Covert-barne. Arb. But I have more hopes then thou hast. Ruth. Not a scruple more; if there were but scales That could weigh hopes for these Rascals must be hang'd Before either of us shall get our own; you may eat and drink Out of yours as I do, and be a sojourner with Abel. Arb. I am hamper'd, but I'le intangle my self With Mr. Abels conjugal cords: nayâI am more Hamper'd then thou thinkest; for if thou art in as bad Case as I (you understand me) hold up thy finger. Ruth. Behold, nay, I'le ne're forsake thee, if I were not Ruth holds up her finger. Smitten, I wou'd perswade my self to be in love, If 'twere but to bear thee company. Arb. Dear girle, hark ye Ruth, the composition day Made an end of all; all's ago. Ruth. Nay, that fatal day put me into the condition Of a Compounder too; there was my heart brought Under sequestration. Arb. That day wench? Ruth. Yes, that very day with two or three forceable Looks 'twas driven an inch at least out of its old place; Sense or reason can't finde the way to't now. Arb. That day, that very day, if you and I should like The same man. Ruth. Fie upon't, as I live thou mak'st me start; Now dare not I ask which thou lik'st. Arb. Wou'd they were now to come in that we might Watch one anothers eyes, and discover by signes; I am not able to ask thee neither. Ruth. Nor I tell thee; shall we go ask Lilly which 'tis? Arb. Out upon him; nay, there's no need of Stars; We know our selves if we durst speak. Ruth. Pish, i'le speak if it be the same, we'l draw cuts. Arb. No, hark ye Ruth, do you act them both, For you saw their several humors, and then watch my Eyes, where I appear most concern'd; I cann't dissemble for my heart. Ruth. I dare swear that will hinder thee to dissemble Indeed,âCome have at you then, I'le speak as if I were Before the honorable rascals: And first, for my brave Blunt Colonel, who hating to take the Oath, cry'd out With a brave scorn (such as made thee in love I hope.) Hang your selves rascals, the time will come when those That dare be honest shall be rewarded; don't I act him bravely, don't I act him bravely? Arb. O admirably well, dear wench do it once more. Ruth. Nay, nay, I must do the 'tother now. Arb. No, no, this once more dear girle, and I'le Act the 'tother for thee. Ruth. No forsooth, I'le spare your pains, we are right, No need of Cuts, send thee good luck with him I acted, And wish me well with my merry Colonel That shall Act his own part. Arb. And a thousand good lucks attend thee; We have sav'd our blushes admirably well, and reliev'd Our hearts from hard dutyâbut mum, see where the Mother Comes, and with her, her Son, a true exemplification or Duplicate of the original Day. Now for a charge. [Enter Mrs. Day and Abel. Ruth. Stand fair, the Enemy draws up. Mrs. Day. Well Mrs. Arbella, I hope you have consider'd Enough by this time; you need not use so much consideration For your own good; you may have your Estate, and you May have Abel, and you may be worse offer'd. Abel, tell her your minde, ne're stand shall I, shall I.â Ruth, does she incline, or is she wilful. Ruth. I was just about the point when your Honor Interrupted us.âOne word in your Ladiships ear. Abel. You see forsooth that I am some body, though you Make no body of me, you see I can prevail; therefore Pray say what I shall trust to; For I must not stand, shall I, shall I. Arb. You are hasty Sir. Abel. I am call'd upon by important affairs; And therefore I must be bold in a fair way to tell you that It lies upon my spirit exceedingly. Arb. Saffron-posset-drink is very good against the The heaviness of the Spirit. Abel. Nay forsooth, you do not understand my meaning. Arb. You do, I hope Sir; and 'tis no matter Sir if one of us know it. Enter Teg. Teg. Well, know? who are all you? Arb. What's here, an Irish Elder come to examine us all. Teg. Well know, what is your names, ever one? Ruth. Arbella, this is a Servant to one of the Colonels; upon My life, 'tis the Irishman that took the Covenant The right way. Arb. Peace, what shou'd it mean? Teg. Well, cannot some of you all say nothing? Mrs. Day. Why how now sauce box? what wou'd you have? What have you left your manners without? go Out and fetch 'um in. Teg. What shou'd I fetch now? Mrs. Day. D'you know who you speak to Sirrah? Teg. Well, what are you then? upon my soul In my own Countrey they can tell who I am. Abel. You must not be so saucy unto her Honour. Teg. Well, I will knock you, if you be saucy with me then. Ruth. This is miraculous. Teg. Is there none of you that I must speak to now? Arb. Now wench if he shou'd be sent to us. [Aside. Teg. Well I wou'd have one Mrs. Tay speak unto me. Mrs. Day. Well sirrah, I am she: what's your business? Teg. O so then, are you Mrs. Tay? Well, I will look well first, And I will set my face in some worship; yes indeed that I will; And I will tell her then what I will speak to her. Ruth. How the fellow begins to mould himself. Arb. And tempers his Chops like a hound that has lap'd Before his meat was cold enough. Ruth. He looks as if he had some gifts to pour forth; Those are Mr. Dayes own white eyes before he begins To say grace: now for a speech ratling in his kecher, As if his words stumbled in their way. Teg. Well, now I will tell thee, I'faith my Master The good Colonel Careless, bid me ask thy good Ladishipâ Upon my soul now the laugh will come upon me. He laughs alwayes when he sayes Ladiship or Honor. Mrs. Day. Sirrah, sirrah, what, were you sent to abuse me? Ruth. As sure as can be. [Aside. Teg. I'faith now I do not abuse thy good Hon. I cannot Help my laugh now, I will try agen now; I will not Think of a Kitchen then: my master wou'd know Of your Ladishipâ Mrs. Day. Did you your Master send you to abuse me you Rascal: By my honor Sirrah? Teg. Why do'st thou mock thy self now joy? Mrs. Day. How sirrah, do I mock my self? This is some Irish Traytor. Teg. I am no Traitor, that I am not; I am an Irish Rebel; you are couzen'd now. Mrs. Day. Sirrah, Sirrah, I will make you know who I am, an impudent Irish rascal. Abel. He seemeth a dangerous fellow, and of a bold and Seditious spirit. Mrs. Day. You are a bloody rascal I warrant ye. Teg. You are a foolish brable brible woman, that you are. Abel. Sirrah, we that are at the head of affairs Must punish your sauciness. Teg. You shall take a knock upon your pate, if you are Saucy with me that I shall; you son of a Roundhead you. Mrs. Day. Ye rascally Varlet, get you out of my doors. Teg. Will not I give you my message then? Mrs. Day. Get you out Rascal? Teg. I prethee let me tell thee my message? Mrs. Day. Get you out I say. Teg. Well then I care not neither; the devil take Your Ladiship, and Honorship, and Kitchenship too: there now. [Exit. Arb. Was there ever such a Scene; 'tis impossible To guess any thing. Ruth. Our Colonels have don't, as sure as thou livest, to Make themselves sport; being all the revenge that is in Their power: look, look, how her Honor trots about, Like a Beast stung with flies. Mrs. Day. How the Villain has distemper'd me! Out upon't too, that I have let the Rascal go unpunish'd, And you can stand by like a Sheep: run after him then and Stop him; I'le have him laid by the heels, and Make him confess who sent him to abuse me: Call help as you go, make haste I say. [Exit Abel. Ruth. 'Slid Arbella run after him, and save the poor Fellow for Sakes sake; Stop Abel by any means That he may scape. Arb. Keep his Dam off, and let me alone with the puppy. [Exit. Ruth. Fear not. Mrs. Day. 'Uds my life, the rascal has heated me.âNow I Think on't I'e go my self, and see it done: a saucy Villain. Ruth. But I must needs acquaint your Honor with one thing First concerning Mrs. Arbella. Mrs. Day. As soon as ever I have done. I'st good news wench? Ruth. Most excellent; if you go out you may spoil all; Such a discovery I have made, that you will bless The accident that anger'd you. Mrs. Day. Quickly then Girle. Ruth. When you sent Abel after the Irish man, Mrs. Arbella's colour came and went in her face, and at last Not able to stay, slunck away after him for fear the Irish-man Shou'd hurt him: she stole away and blush'd the prettiest. Mrs. Day. I protest he may be hurt indeed; I'le run my self too. Ruth. By no means forsooth; nor is there any need on't; For she resolv'd to stop him before he cou'd Get near the Irish-man; she has done it upon my life; And if you shou'd go out you might spoil the kindest Encounter that the loving Abel is ever like to have. Mrs. Day. Art sure of this? Ruth. If you do not finde she has stopt him, Let me ever have your hatred; pray credit me. Mrs. Day. I do, I do believe thee; come we'l go in where I use to read: there thou shalt tell me all the particulars, And the manner of it: I warrant 'twas pretty to observe. Ruth. O, 'twas a thousand pitties you did not see't, When Abel walk't away so bravely, and foolishly after this Wilde Irishman: She stole such kinde looks from her Own eyes; and having rob'd her self, sent them after Her own Abel; and thenâ Mrs. Day. Come good wench, I'le go in and hear it all at Large; it shall be the best tale thou hast told these two dayes. Come, come, I long to hear all. Abel for his part needs No news by this time, come good wench. [Exit. Ruth. So far I am right; fortune take care for future things. Enter C. Blunt as taken by Bayliffs. C. Bl. At whose suit, Rascals? 1 B. You shall know that time enough. C. Bl. Time enough, dogs; must I wait your leasures? 1 B. O you are a dangerous man; 'tis such Traitors as you That disturb the Peace of the Nation. C. Bl. Take that Rascal: if I had any thing at liberty Besides my foot, I wou'd bestow it on you. 1 B. You shall pay dearly for this kick before you are Let loose, and give good special Bail: Mark that, my Surly companion; we have you fast. C. Bl. 'Tis well Rogues you caught me conveniently; Had I been aware I wou'd have made some of your scurvy Souls my special Bail. 1 B. O, 'tis a bloody minded man; I'le warrant ye this Vile Cavalier has eat many a Childe. C. Bl. I cou'd gnaw a piece or two of you Rascals. Enter C. Careless. C. Car. How is this! Blunt in hold! you Catchpole, Let go your prey, orâ [Draws, and Blunt in the scuffle throws up one of their heels, and gets a Sword, and helps drive them off. 1 B. Murder, Murder. C. Bl. Faith Careless this was worth thanks, I was fairly going. C. Car. What was the matter man? C. Bl. Why, an Action or two for Free Quarter, now made Trover and Conversion: Nay, I believe we shall be sued With an Action of Trespass; for every Field we have Marched over, and be indited for Riots, for going at Unseasonable hours, above two in a Company. [Enter Teg running. C. Car. Well come, let's away. Teg. Now upon my soul run as I do; the men in red Coats are running too, that they are, and they cry, Murder, Murder, I never heard such a noise in Ireland, that's true too. C. Car. 'Slife we must shift several wayes. Farewel, if we scape we meet at night; I shall Take heed now. Teg. Shall I tell of Mrs. Tay now? C. Car. O good Teg, no time for Messages. Exeunt several wayes. Enter Bayliffs and Souldiers. [A noise within. 1 B. This way, this way; Oh villains, my neighbour Swash is hurt dangerously; Some good Souldiers, follow, follow. Enter Careless and Teg again. C. Car. I am quite out of breath, and the Blood Hounds Are in a full cry upon a burning scent: Plague on 'um, What a noise the Kennels make? what door's this That graciously stands a little open? what an ass am I to ask? Teg, scout abroad; if any thing happens extraordinary, Observe this door; there you shall finde me: be careful, Now by your favour Landlord, as unknown. [Exit severally. Enter Mrs. Day and Obadiah. Mrs. Day. It was well observed Obadiah to bring the Parties to me first, 'tis your Masters will that I shou'd as I May say, prepare matters for him; in truth, in truth I have too great a burthen upon me: yet for the publick Good I am content to undergo it. Obad. I shall with sincere care present unto your Honor From time to time such negotiations as I may discreetly Presume may be material for your Honors inspection. Mrs. Day. It will become you so to do, you have the Present that came last. Obad. Yes, and please your Honor; the Gentleman Concerning her Brothers release, hath also Sent in a piece of Plate. Mrs. Day. It's very well. Obad. But the man without, about a bargain of the Kings Land, is come empty. Mrs. Day. Bid him be gone, I'le not speak with him; He does not understand himself. Obad. I shall intimate so much to him. [As Obadiah goes out, C. Careless meets him and tumbles him back. Mrs. Day. Why how now? what rude companion's this? What wou'd you have (what's your business? what's the Matter? who sent you? who d'you belong to? who!â C. Car. Hold, hold, if you mean to be answer'd to all These Intergotories, you see I resolve to be your companion; I am a man, there's no great matter, no body sent me; nor I Belong to no body: I think I have answer'd to the chief Heads. Mrs. Day. Thou hast committed murder for ought I know? How is't Obadiah? C. Car. Ha, what luck have I to fall into the Territories Of my old Kitchen acquaintance; I'le proceed upon the Strength of Teg's Message, though I had no answer. Mrs. Day. How is't man? Obad. Truly he came forcably upon me, and I fear Has bruised some intellectuals within my Stomach. [Ex. Oba. Mrs. Day. Go in and take some Irish slat by way of Prevention, and keep your self warm. Now Sir, have you Any business, you that came in so rudely as if you did not know who you came to. How came you in Sir Royster? Was not the Porter at the Gate? C. Car. No truly, the Gate kept it self, and stood gaping As if it had a minde to speak, and say, I pray come in. Mrs. Day. Did it so Sir? and what have you to say? C. Car. I, there's the point; either she does not, or will Not know me: What shou'd I say? how dull am I? pox on't, This wit, is like a common friend, when one has need on him He won't come near one. Mrs. Day. Sir, are you studying for an invention? for ought I know you have done some mischief, And 'twere fit to secure you? C. Care. So that's well, 'twas pretty to fall into the head Quarter of the Enemy. Mrs. Day. Nay, 'tis e'ne so, I'le fetch Those that shall examine you. C. Car. Stay, thou mighty States woman, I did but Give you time to see if your memory would but be so Honest, as to tell you who I am. Mrs. Day. What d'you mean sauce box? C. Car. There's a word yet of thy former imployments That sauce you and I have been acquainted. Mrs. Day. I do not use to have acquaintance with Cavaliers. C. Car. Nor I with Committee-mens Utensils; but in Diebus illis, you were not Honorable, nor I a Malignant. Lord, Lord, you are horrible forgetful, pride comes with Godliness, and good Cloathes; what, you think I shou'd Not know you, because you are disguised with curl'd hair, And white Gloves. Alas, I know you as well as if you were In your Sabbath-dayes Cinamon Waiscot, with a silver Edgine round the Skirt. Mrs. Day. How sirrah? C. Car. And with your fair hands bath'd in Lather, or With your fragrant Breath; driving the fleeting Ambergreece off from the waving Kitchenstuff. Mrs. Day. O, you are an impudent Cavalier! I remember You now indeed; but I'leâ C. Car. Nay, but hark you the now Honorable, Non abstante, past conditions; did not I send my fool man, An Irish man, with a civil message to you; Why all this strangeness then. Mrs. Day. How, how, how's this; was' you that sent That Rascal to abuse me, was't so. C. Car. How now! what, matters grow worse and worse? Mrs. Day. I'le teach you to abuse those that are in Authority: Within there, who's whithin? C. Car. 'Slife, I'le stop your mouth, if you raise an alarum. [Cryes out, and he stops her mouth. Mrs. Day. Stop my mouth sirrah, whoo, whoo, ho. C. Car. Yes, stop your mouth, what are you good at a Who, bub, ha. Enter Ruth. Ruth. What's the matter forsooth. Mrs. Day. The matter? why hears a rude Cavalier has Broke into my house; 'twas he too that sent the Irish Rascal To abuse me too within my own walls: call your Father that He may grant his order to secure him. 'Tis a dangerous fellow. C. Car. Nay good pretty Gentlewoman spare your motion, What must become of me; Teg has made some strange mistake. Ruth. 'Tis he, what shall I do, (now invention be equal to My Love, why, your Ladiship will spoil all? I sent for [Aside. This Gentleman, and injoyn'd him secresie, even to you your self, Till I had made his way. O fie upon't, I am to blame; but in Truth I did not think he would have come these two hours. C. Car. I dare swear she did not; I might very probably Not have come at all. Ruth. How came you to come so soon Sir; 'twas three Hours before you appointed. C. Car. Hey day, I shall be made believe I came hither On purpose presently. Ruth. 'Twas upon a message of his to me, and please your Honor to make his desires known to your Ladiship, that he Had consider'd on't, and was resolved to take the Covenant, And give you five hundred pound to make his peace, and bring His business about again, that he may be Admitted in his first condition. C. Car. What's this? d'hear pretty Gentlewoman. Ruth. Well, well, I know your mind, I have done your business. Mrs. Day. Oh, his stomach's come down! Ruth. Sweeten him again, and leave him to me; I warrant you the five hundred pound, andâ [Whispers C. Car. Now I have found it: this pretty wench has A minde to be left alone with me, at her peril. Mrs. Day. I understand thee; well Sir, I can pass by rudeness When I am informed there was no intention of it; I leave You and my Daughter to beget a right understanding. C. Car. We should beget Sons and Daughters sooner: What does all this mean? Ruth. I am sorry Sir that your love for me Shou'd make you thus rash. C. Car. That's more then you know, but you had a minde To be left alone with me; that's certain. Ruth. 'Tis too plain Sir, you'd ne'er have run your self Into this danger else. C. Car. Nay, now you'r out; the danger run after me. Ruth. You may dissemble. C. Car. Why, 'tis the proper business here; but we lose Time; you and I are left to beget right understanding, Come, which way? Ruth, Whither? C. Car. To your Chamber or Closet. Ruth. But I am ingag'd you shall take the Covenant. C. Car. No, I never sware when I am bid. Ruth. But you wou'd do as bad? C. Car. That's not against my principles. Ruth. Thank you for your fair opinion, good Signior Principle, there lies your way Sir, however I will own so much Kindeness for you, that I repent not the civility I have done, To free you from the trouble you were like to fall into; Make me a leg, if you please, and cry, thank you: and so the Gentlewoman that desired to be left alone with you, desires To be left alone with her self, she being taught aright Understanding of you. C. Car. No, I am revited; nor shall you march off thus With flying colours: my pretty Commander in chief, let us Parley a little farther, and but lay down ingenuously the true State of our Treaty. The business in short is this, We differ Seemingly upon two evils, and mine the least; and therefore To be chosen, you had better take me then I Take the Covenant. Ruth. We'l excuse one another. C. Car. You wou'd not have me take the Covenant then. Ruth. No, I did but try you, I forgive your idle looseness; For that firm vertue be constant to your fair principles In spight of fortune. C. Car. What's this got into petti-coatsâbut d'hear, I'le not excuse you from my proposition, notwithstanding My release: Come we are half way to a right Understandingânay, I no love thee. Ruth. Love vertue, you have but here and there a patch Of it; y'are ragged still. C. Car. Are not you the Committee Dayes Daughter? Ruth. Yes, what then. C. Car. Then am I thankful, I had no defence against thee, And Matrimony, but thy own Father and Mother, Which are a perfect Committee to my nature. Ruth. Why are you sure I wou'd have match'd with a Malignant, not a Compounder neither. C. Car. Nay, I have made thee a Joynter against my will; Methinks it were but as reasonable, that I shou'd do something For my Joynter, but by the way of Matrimony honestly To encrease your Generation; 'tis to tell you truth is Against my Conscience. Ruth. Yet you wou'd beget right understandings. C. Car. Yes, I wou'd have 'um all Bastards. Ruth. And me a Whore. C. Car. That's a coarse name; but 'tis not fit a Committee- Mans Daughter shou'd be too honest, to the reproach Of her Father and Mother. Ruth. When the quarrel of the Nation is reconcil'd, you And I shall agree: till when Sirâ [Enter Teg Teg. Are you here then? upon my soul the good Colonel Blunt is over-taken again now, and carried to the Devil, That he is, I'faith now. C. Car. How, taken and carried to the Devil! Teg. He desired to go to the Devil, that he did, I wonder of My soul he was not afraid of that. C. Car. I understand it now; what mischief's this? Ruth. You seem troubled Sir. C. Car. I have but a life to lose, that I am weary of: come Teg. Ruth. Hold, you shan't go before I know the business; What d'ye talk of? C. Car. My friend, my dearest friend is caught up by rascally Bayliffs, and carried to the Devil-Tavern; pray let me go. Ruth. Stay but a minute, if you have any kindness for me. C. Car. Yes, I do love you. Ruth. Perhaps I may serve your friend. [Enter Arbella. O Arbella, I was going to seek you. Arb. What's the matter? Ruth. The Colonel which thou lik'st is taken by Bayliffs; There's his Friend too, almost distracted: You know The mercy of these times. Arb. What do'st thou tell me, I am ready to sink down! Ruth.

Look where he and Obadiah comes; shou'd either By providenceâO Mr. Abel, where have you been this long Time? can you finde of your heart to keep thus out of my sight? Abel. Assuredly some important affairs constrain'd my Absence, as Obadiah can testifie, Bonafide. Obad. I can do so verily, my self being a material party. C. Car. Pox on 'um, how slow they speak. Arb. Well well, you shall go no more out of my sight; I'le Not be satisfied with your Bona Fides: I have some occasions That call me to go a little way; you shall e'en go with me, And good Obadiah too: you shall not deny me any thing. Abel. Is it not meet I shou'd, I am exceedingly exalted? Obadiah thou shalt have the best bargain of all my Tenants. Obad. I am thankful. C. Car. What may this mean? [Aside. Arb. Ruth, how shall we do to keep thy swift Mother From pursuing us? Ruth. Let me alone, as I go by the Parlor where she sits, Big with expectation; I'le give her a whisper that we Are going to fetch the very five hundred pound. Arb. How can that be? Ruth. No question now. Will you march Sir? C. Car. Whither? Ruth. Lord, how dull these men in Love are! why to your Friend. No more words. C. Car. I will stare upon thee though. [Exeunt.</field>

Why you unconscionable Rascals, are you Angry that I am unlucky, or do you want some Fees? I'le perish in a dungeon before I'le consume with throwing Sops to such Curs. 1. Ba. Chuse, chuse, come along with him. C. Bl. I'le not go your pace neither Rascals; I'le go softly, If it be but to hinder you from taking up some other Honest Gentleman. 1 B. Very well, surly Sir, we will carry you where you Shall not be troubled what pace to walk; you'l finde a Large Bell, blood is dear; not yours is it? a farthing a pint Were very dear for the best urine you have. Enter Arbella, Ruth, Abel, C. Careless, and Obadiah. 1. B. How now, are these any of your Friends? C. Bl. Never if you see women, that's a rule. Arb. Nay, you need have no scruple, 'tis a near Kinsman Of mine, you do not think I hope that I wou'd let you sufferâ Youâthat must be nearer then a Kinsman to me. Ab. But my Mother doth not know it. Arb. If that be all, leave it to me and Ruth, we'l save You harmless: besides I cannot marry, if my Kinsman be in Prison; he must convey my Estate as you appoint; for 'tis All in him, we must please him. Abel. The consideration of that doth convince me. Obadiah, 'tis necessary for us to set at liberty this Gentleman, Being a Trustee for Mrs. Arbella's Estate; tell 'um therefore That you and I will Bail this Gentlemanâandâ D'hear, tell them who I am. Obad. I shall. Gentlemen, this is the honorable Mr. Abel Day, the first born of the Honorable Mr. Day, Chair-man of the Committee of Sequestrations, and I My self by name of Obadiah, and Clerk to the said Honorable Committee. 1 B. Well Sir, we know Mr. Day, and Mr. Abel. Abel. Yes, that's I, and I will bail this Gentleman; I believe You dare not accept against the Bail: nay, you shall have Obadiahs too, one that the State trusts. 1 B. With all our hearts Sirâ But there are Charges to be paid. Arb. Here Obadiah, take this Purse and discharge them, And give the Bayliffs twenty shillings to drink. C. Bl. This is miraculous. 1 B. A brave Lady: i'faith Mrs. we'l drink your health. Abel. She's to be my Wife, as sure as you are here; What say you to that now? 1 B. That's impossible; here's something more in this: Honorable Mr. Abel, the Sheriffs Deputy is hard by in Another room, if you please to go thither, And give your Bail Sir. Abel. Well, shew us the way, and let him know who I am. C. Car. Hark ye, pretty Mrs. Ruth, if you were not [Exeunt Abel, Obadiah, and Bayliffs. A Committee-mans Daughter, and so consequently Against Monarchy, two Princes shou'd Have you and that Gentlewoman. Ruth. No, no, you'l serve my turn; I am not ambitious. C. Car. Do but swear then that thou art not the Issue of Mr. Day, and though I know 'tis a lye, I'le be content To be cousen'd, and believe. Ruth. Fie, fie, you can't abide taking of Oaths; look, Look how your friend and mine take aim at one another: Is he smitten? C. Car. Cupid has not such another wounded Subject, Nay, and is vex't he is in love too; Troth 'tis partly my own case. Ruth. Peace, she begins as need requires. Arb. You are free Sir. C. Bl. Not so free as you think. Arb. What hinders it? C. Bl. Nothing, but I'le tell you. Arb. Why Sir? C. Bl. You'l laugh at me. Arb. Have you perceived me apt to commit such a rudeness, Pray let me know it? C. Bl. Upon two conditions you shall know it. Arb. Well, make your own Laws. C. Bl. First I thank you, y'have freed me nobly; pray Believe it, you have this acknowledgement from an Honest heart, one that would crack a string for you, That's one thing. Arb. Well, the other. C. Bl. The other is onely, that I may stand so ready, That I may be gone just as I have told it you; together With your promise, not to call me back: and upon these Terms I give you leave to laugh when I am gone. Careless, Come stand ready, that at the sign given We may vanish together. Ruth. If you please Sir, when you are ready to start, I'le cry one, two, three, and away. C. Bl. Be pleased to forbear, good smart Gentlewoman, You have leave to jeer when I am gone, and am just going; By your spleens leave a little patience. Arb. Prethee peace. Ruth. I shall contain Sir. C. Bl. That's much for a woman to do. Arb. Now Sir, perform your promise. C. Bl. Careless, have you done with your woman? C. Car. Madamâ C. Bl. Nay, I have thank't her already; prethee no more Of that dull way of gratitude; stand ready man, yet nearer The door: so now my misfortune that I promised to Discover, is, that I love you above my sense or reason: So farewel, and laugh; come Careless. C. Car. Ladies, our lives are yours; be but so kinde as to Believe it, till you have something to command. [Exeunt. Ruth. Was there ever such humor? Arb. As I live his confession shews nobly. Ruth. It shews madly I am sure, an ill bred fellow, not Indure a woman to laugh at him! Arb. He's honest I dare swear. Ruth. That's more then I dare swear for my Colonel. Arb. Out upon him. Ruth. Nay, 'tis but for want of a good example; I'le make him so. Arb. But d'hear Ruth, we were horribly to blame, that we Did not enquire where they lodg'd, under pretence of sending To them about their own business. Ruth. Why, thy whimsical Colonel discharg'd himself off Like a Gun: there was no time between the flashing in The pan, and the going off, to ask a question: but hark ye, I have an invention upon the old account of the Five hundred pound, which shall make Abel send His pursuivant Obadiah to look 'um. Arb. Excellent! the trout Abel will bite immediately at That bait: the message shall be as from his Master Day, Senior, to come and speak with him; they'l think Presently 'tis about their Composition, and come certainly. In the mean time we'l prepare them with Counter expectations. Enter Abel and Obadiah. Ruth. You have it, peace, see where Abel and the gentle Squire of low degree; Obadiah approaches, having newly Entred themselves into bonds. Arb. Which I'le be sure to tell his Mother, if he be Ever more troublesome. Ruth. And that he's turn'd an arrant Cavalier, By bailing one of the Brood. Abel. I have according to your desires given freedom to Your Kinsman and Trustee; I suppose he doth perceive That you may have power in right of me. Arb. Good Mr. Abel, I am sincerely beholding to you, And your Authority. Ruth. O fie upon't brother, I did forget to acquaint You with a business before the Gentlemen went. O me, what a sieve like memory have I, 'Twas am important affair too. Abel. If you discover it to me, I shall render you My opinion upon the whole. Ruth. The two Gentlemen have repented of their obstinacy, And wou'd now present five hundred pound to your good Honorable Mother, to stand their friend, that they may be Permitted to take the Covenant, and we, negligent we, Have let them go, before we knew where to send to them. Abel. That was the want of being us'd to important affairs; It is ill to neglect the accepting of their conversion, Together with their money. Ruth. Well, there is but one way; do you send Obadiah In your Fathers name, to desire them both to come to his house About some business that will be for their good, but no more; For then they'l take it ill; for they enjoyn'd us secresie; And when they come, let us alone: Obadiah may enquire Them out at some Tavern. Obad. The Bayliffs did say they were gone To the Devil-Tavern to pay a reckoning. Abel. Hasten thither good good Obadiah, as if you had met My Honorable Father, and desire them to come unto His house, about am important affair that is for their good. Obad. I shall use expedition. [Exit. Abel. And we will hasten home, lest the Gentlemen shou'd Be before us, and not know how to address their offers; And then we will hasten our being united in the Bonds of Matrimony. Arb. Soft and fare goes far. [Exeunt. Enter the two Colonels, and Teg as at the Tavern. C. Car. Cid ever man get away to craftily from the thing He lik't; terrible business, afraid to tell a woman what she Desir'd to hear; I pray heartily that the boyes do not come To the knowledge of thy famous retreat; we shall be followed By those small birds, as you have seen an Owl pursued. C. Bl. I shall break some of their wings then. C. Car. To leave a handsome woman, a woman that came To be bound body for body for thee; one that does that Which no woman will hardly do again. C. Bl. What's that? C. Car. Love thee, and thy Blunt Humor; a meer chance Man, a thing besides all the venerate Stars. C. Bl. You practice your wit to no purpose; I am not To be perswaded to lie still, like a Jack-a-lent to be cast at; I had rather be a Wisp hung up for a Woman to scold at, Then a fix'd Lover for 'um to point at: Your squib began to hiss. Enter Obadiah. C. Car. Peace man, here's Jupiters Mercury is his Message to us trow? Obad. Gentlemen, you are opportunely over-taken And found out. C. Bl. How's this? Obad. I come unto you in the name of the Honorable Mr. Day, who desires to speak with you both about some Important affair, which is conducing for your good. C. Bl. What train is this? C. Car. Peace, let us not be rash Teg. Teg. Well then, C. Car. Were it not possible that you cou'd entertain this Fellow in the next room till he were pretty drunk? Teg. I warrant you that now, I will make him and my self Too drunk for thy sweet sake. C. Car. Be sure Tegâsome business Sir, that will take us Up a very little time to finish, make us desire your patience Till we dispatch it: In the mean time Sir do us the Favour as to call for a glass of Sack: in the next room Teg shall wait upon you, and drink your Masters health. Obad. It needeth not, nor do I use to drink healths. C. Car. None but your Masters Sir, and that by Way of remembrance. Ob. We that have the affairs of State under our our Tuition cannot long delay; my presence may be required For the carrying on the work. C. Car. Nay Sir, it shall not exceed above a quarter Of an hour; perhaps we'l wait upon you to Mr. Day presently: Pray Sir drink but one glass or two; we wou'd wait upon you Our selves, but that wou'd hinder us from going with you. Obad. Upon that consideration I shall attend a little. C. Car. Go wait upon him, now Teg or never. Teg. I will make him so drunk as can be upon my soul. C. Bl. What a devil shou'd this message mean? [Exeunt. C. Car. 'Tis too plain; this cream of Committee rascals! who Better intelligence then a State Secretary, has heard Of his Son Abels being hamper'd, in the cause of the Wicked, and in revenge wou'd intice us to perdition. C. Bl. If Teg cou'd be so portunate as to make him drunk, We might know all. C. Car. If the close hearted Rogue will not be open mouth'd, We'l leave him pawn'd for all our scores, and stuff his pockets With blanck Commissions. C. Bl. Only fill up one with his Masters name. C. Car. And another with his wifes name for Adjutant General, Together with a Bill of Ammunition hid under Dayes house, And make it be digg'd down, with scandal of Delinquency. A Rascal to think to invite us into New-gate! C. Bl. Well, we must resolve what to do. C. Car. I have a fancy come into my head that may produce An admirable Scene. C. Bl. Come, let's hear. C. Car. 'Tis open supposition, that Teg makes him drunk, And by the way 'tis a good Omen that we have no sober Apparition in that wavering posture of frailty; we'l send him Home in a Sedan, and cause him to be deliver'd in that Good natur'd condition, to the ill natur'd Rascal His Master. C. Bl. It will be excellent: how I pray for Teg To be victorious! Enter Musician. Mus. Gentlemen, will you have any Musick? C. Bl. Prethee no, we are out of tune. C. Car. Pish, we never will be out of humor. Do'st hear, Canst sing us a Malignant Sonnet? Mus. I can sing many Songs. You seem honest Gentlemen. C. Car. Cavaliers thou mean'st. Sing without any apprehension. SONG. Now the Vail is pull'd off, and this pitiful Nation Too late see the gull of a Kirk Reformation, How all things that shou'd be Are turn'd topsie turvy; The Freedom we have, Our Prince made a Slave, And the Masters must now turn the Waiters. The great ones obey, While the Rascals do sway, And the Loyal to Rebels are Traitors. The Pulpits are crowded with tongues of their own, And the Preachers spiritual Committee-men grown, To denounce Sequestration On Souls of old Fashion, They Rail and they Pray, Till they quite preach away The Wealth that was once the wise Cities. The Courts in the Hall Where the Lawyers did bawl Are turn'd into pious Committees. C. Car. This Song has rais'd my Spirits: Here, sing alwayes For the King; I wou'd have every man in his way do something For him; I wou'd have Fidlers sing for him, Parsons pray For him, Men fight for him, Women scold for him, and Children cry for him, and according to this rule, [Enter Teg and Obadiah drunk Teg is drinking for him: but see, See and rejoyce where Teg with Laurel comes. C. Bl. And the vanquish't Obadiah with nothing fix'd About him but his eyes. C. Car. Stay, sing another Song in the behalf of Compounders if thou canst, that the vapors of the Wine May have full power to ascend up to the firmament of His truly reformed Coxcomb. SONG. Come Drawer some Wine Let it sparkle and shine, And make its own drops fall abounding; Like the Hearts it makes light, Let it flow pure and right, And a Plague take all kinde of Compounding. We'l not be too wise, Nor try to advise, How to suffer and gravely despair: For Wisdom and Parts Sit brooding on hearts, And there they catch nothing but care. Not a thought shall come in But what brings our King, Let Committees be damn'd with their gain; We'l send by this stealth To our Hearts our Kings Health, And there in despite he shall Reign. [Obadiah repeating with him. C. Car. This is sport beyond modest hopes. How I will Adore Sack that can force this fellow to Religion. The rogue Is full of Worship. Teg. Well now, upon my soul Mr. Obed Commit sings as well as the man now: Come then will you sing as Irish Song after me? Obad. I will sing Irish for the King now. Teg. I will sing for the King as well as you. Hark you now. Obad. That is too hard stuff; I cannot do these and these Material matters. [He sings an Irish Song, and Obadiah tries. Teg. Here now, we will take some snuff for the Kingâso There lay it upon your hand; put one of your noses to it now, So snuff now. Upon my soul Mr. Obed Commit will make A brave Irish man. Obad. I wi'l snuff for the King no more. Good Mr. Teg, Give me some more Sack, and sing English for my money. Teg. I will tell you that Irish is as good and better too. Come now we will dance: Can you play an Irish Tune? Can you play this now. Mus. No Sir, but I can play you an excellent Irish Jig. [They dance. C. Car. This is beyond thought: So this motion Like a tumbled barrel has set the liquor a working again. Now for a Chair. [Enter Drawer. C. Bl. Drawer, who waits there? Drawer. What d'you want Gentlemen? C. Bl. Call a Chair presently, and bring their Chair into This room; here's a friend of ours overtaken. Drawer. I go Sir. [Exit. C. Car. Teg thou hast done miracles, thou art a good Omen, And has vanquish'd the cause in this overthrow of this Counterfeit Rascal its true Epitome: And now Teg According to the words of condemnation we'l send him To the place from whence he came. Teg. Upon my soul he's dead now, shall I howl as we do In Ireland. C. Car. How's that Teg. Teg. Yo, yo. [Howls. C. Car. No more good Teg, lest you give an Alarm to the Enemy. Welcome honest fellow; by your looks you seem so. [Enter Sedan. 1 C. How Colonel, have you forgot your poor Souldier Ned. C. Car. Why, this is a miraculous pursuit of good fortune Honest Ned; what turn'd Chair-man? 1. Any thing for Bread and Beer, noble Colonel shall I Have the Honor to carry you. C. Car. No Ned, is thy fellow honest? 1. Or I'de be hang'd before I carry a Chair an inch with him. C. Car. 'Tis wellâlook you Ned, that fellow is Mr. Day The Committee-man's Clerk, whom with wonderful industry We have made drunk: Just as he is, pack him up in thy Chair, And immediately transport him to his Master Dayes house; And in the very Hall turn him out. There's half a Crown For thy pains. 1. If I fail say Ned's a Coward: Come shall we put your short Wing'd worship into your mew. Come along. [They put him in and Ex. C. Car. Farewel Ned: Teg come, you must carry some Money to one or two confident friends of mine; We'l pay our reckoning at the Bar, then go home and laugh; And if you will plot some way to see our inchanting Females Once more; they make me so longâ [Exeunt. Enter Mr. Day, and Mrs. Day. Mrs. Day. Dispatch quickly I say, and say I said it; many Things fall between the lip and the cup. Mr. Day. Nay duck, let thee alone for counsel. Ah, If thou hadst been a man. Mrs. Day. Why then you wou'd have wanted a woman, And a helper too. Mr. Day. I profess so I shou'd, and a notable one too, though I say't before thy face, and that's no ill one. Mrs. Day. Come, come, you are wandring from the matter; Dispatch the Marriage I say, whilst she is thus taken with Our Abel. Women are uncertain. Mr. Day. How if she shou'd be coy. Mrs. Day. You are at your ifs again; if she be foolish, Tell her plainly what she must trust to, no Abel, no Land; Plain dealing's a Jewel: Have you the Writings drawn As I advised you, which she must sign? Mr. Day. I, I warrant you duck; Here, here they be. Oh she has a brave Estate. Mrs. Day. What news you have. Mr. Day. Look you Wife. [Day pulls out Writings, and layes out his Keyes. Mrs. Day. Pish, teach your Granam to spin; let me see. Enter Servant. Serv. May it please your Honor, your good neighbour Zechariah is departing this troublesome life: he has made Your Honor his Executor, but cannot depart Till he has seen your Honors. Mr. Day. Alas, alas, a good man will leave us, Come good Duck, let us hasten: Where is Obadiah to usher you? Mrs. Day. Why Obadiah, a Varlet to be out of the way at Such a time; truly he moveth my wrath. Come Husband along, I'le take Abel in his place. [Enter Ruth and Arbella. Ruth. What's the meaning of this Alarm? there's some Carion Discover'd; the Crows are all gone upon a sudden. Arb. The she-Day call'd most fiercely for Obadiah; Look here, Ruth, what have they left behind? Ruth. As I live it is the Days bunch of Keys, which he always Keeps so closely:âwellâif thou hast any metal, Now's the time. Arb. To do what? Ruth. To fly out of Egypt. [Enter Abel. Arb. Peace, we are betrai'd else; as sure as can be wench He's come back for the Keyes. Ruth. We'l forswear 'um in confident words, and no less Confident countenances. Abel. An important affair hath call'd my Honorable Father And Mother forth, and in the absence of Obadiah I am enforced To attend their Honors; and therefore I conceiv'd it right And meet to acquaint you with it; lest in my absence you Might have apprehended, that some mischance had befallen My person: therefore I desire you to receive consolation; And so I bid you heartily farewel. [Exit. Arb. Given from his mouth this tenth of April, he Put me in a cruel fright. Ruth. As I live I am all over in such a dew as hangs about a Still when 'tis first set a going; but this is better and better: There was never such an opportunity to break prison. I know the very places holes in his Closet where the Composition of your Estate lies, and where the Deeds of my Own Estate lies. I have cast my eye upon them often When I have gone up to him in errands, and to call Him to dinner. If I miss hang me. Arb. But whither shall we go? Ruth. To a friend of mine, and of my Fathers that lives Near the Temple, and will harbor us; fear not, and so set Up for our selves, and get our Colonels. Arb. Nay, the mischief that I have done, and the condition We are in, makes me as ready as thou art: come let's about it. Ruth. Stay, do you stand Centinel here, that's the Closset-Window; I'le call for thee if I need thee; and Be sure to give notice of any news of the enemy. [Exit. Arb. I warrant thee, may but this departing Brother have So much string of life left him as may tie this expecting Day To his bed-side, till we have commited this honest roberyâ Hark!âwhat's thatâthis apprehension can make a noise When there is none. Ruth. I have 'um, I have 'um; nay the whole covey, And his seal at arms bearing a Dogs leg. [Above. Arb. Come make haste then. Ruth. As I live here's a Letter counterfeited to the King, To the Rascal his rebellious Subject Day; with a remembrance To his discreet wife; nay, what do'st thou think these are? I'le but cast my eye upon these papers that were scismatically, And lay in separation: what do'st think they are? Arb. I can't tell; nay prethee come away. Ruth. Out upon the precize Baboon: They are Letters from two wenches, one from an encrease of sallary To maintain his unlawful Issue; another from a Wench That had more conscience then he, and refus'd To take the Physick that he prescrib'd to take away A natural Timpany. Arb. Nay, prethee dispatch. Ruth. Here be abundance more; come run up, and help Me carry 'um. We'l take the whole Index of his rogeries? We shall be furnish'd with such armes offensive and defensive That we shall never need. Sue to him for a League. Come, make haste. Arb. I come. Enter with the Sedan. 1.

C. Car. I'le leap into thy arms.â Ruth. So you may break your neck: If you do, I'le jump too; But time steals on our words; observe all I have told you: So farewel.â C. Car. Nay, as the good Fellows use to say, let us not part With dry lips.âOne kiss. Ruth. Not a bit of me till I am all yours. C. Car. Your hand then, to shew I am grown reasonable. A poor Compounder. Ruth. Pish, there's a dirty Glove upon't.â C. Car. Give me but any naked part, and I'le kiss it as a Snail Creeps, and leave sign where my lips slid along.â Ruth. Good Snail get out of your hole first, think of Your business. So fareâ C. Car. Nay, prethee be not asham'd that thou art loath To leave me. 'Slid I am a man, but I'me as arrant a rogue as thy Quondam Father Day, if I cou'd not cry to leave thee A brace of minutes. Ruth. Away, we grow foolishâfarewelâyet be carefulâ Nay, go in. C. Car. Do you go first. Ruth. Nay, fie, go in. C. Car. We'l fairly then divide the victory, And draw off together.âSoâI will have the last look. [Exeunt severally, looking at one another. Enter C. Blunt, and Souldier. C. Bl. No more words; I do believe, nay, I know thou art Honest. I may live to thank thee better. Soul. I scorn any encouragement to love my King, or those That serve him. I took pay under these people, With a design to do him service, the Lieutenant knows it. C. Bl. He has told me so, no more words, thou art a noble Fellow; thou art sure his window's large enough? Soul. Fear it not. C. Bl. Here then, carry him this ladder of ropes: so now give Me the Coat; say not a word to him, but bid him dispatch When he sees the coast clear; he shall be waited for at The bottom of his Window. Give him thy Sword too if He desires it. Soul. I'le dispatch it instantly, therefore get to your place. C. Bl. I warrant ye. [Exit Enter Teg. Teg. Have you done every thing then? by my soul now Yonder is the man with the hard name; that man now that I Made drunk for thee, Mr. Tayes Rascal; he is coming along There behinde, now upon my soul that he is. C. Bl. The Rascal comes for some mischief. Teg, now or Never play the man. Teg. How shou'd I be a man then? C. Bl. Thy Master is never to be got out if this Rogue Gets hither; meet him therefore Teg in the most winning Manner thou canst, and make him once more drunk, and it Shall be call'd the second edition of Obadiah, put forth With Irish notes upon him; and if he will not go drink with thee. Teg. I will carry him upon my back side, if he will not go; And if he will not be drunk, I will cut his throat then, that I will, for my sweet Master now, that I will. C. Bl. Dispatch good Teg, and dispatch him too if he will Not be conformable; and if thou canst but once more Be victorious, bring him in Triumph to Lieutenant Stories, There shall be the general rendezvouz: now or never Teg. Teg. I warrant you I will get drink into his pate, or I will Break it for him; that I will, I warrant you: he shall Not come after you now. C. Bl. Good luck go with thee: the fellow's faithful and Stout; that fear's over: now to my station. [Exit. C. Careless as in Prison. C. Car. The time's almost come, how slow it flutters? My desires are better wing'd: how I long to counterfeit A faintness when I come to the bottom, and sink into the arms Of this dear witty fair!âHa, who's this? [Enter Souldier. Soul. Here Sir, here's a Ladder of Ropes, fasten it to your Window, and descend: you shall be waited for. C. Car. The careful her creature has sent itâbut d'hear Sir, Cou'd you not spare that implement by your side? it might Serve to keep off small Curs. Soul. You'l have no need on't, but there 'tis, make haste, The coast is clear. [Exit. C. Car. O this pretty she Captain, General over my soul And body; the thought of her musters every faculty I have: She has sent the Ropes, and stayes for me; no danger of the Ropes, ever slide down with that swiftness (of desire of haste) That I will make to thee. [Exit. Enter Blunt in his Souldiers Coat. C. Bl. All's quiet, and the coast clear; so far it goes well; That is the window, in this nook I'le stand, till I see him Coming down. [Steps in. C. Careless above in his Souldiers habit, lets down the Ladder of Ropes and speaks. C. Car. I cannot see my North Star that I must sail by, 'tis Clouded, only she stands close perhaps in some corner; I'le not trifle time, all's clear; Fortune forbear Thy tricks but for this small occasion. [Enter Blunt. C. Bl. What's this, a Souldier in the place; Careless I am betrayed, but I'le end this Rascals duty. C. Car. How, a Souldier! betray'd! this Rascal shan't laugh at me. C. Bl. Dog. C. Car. How Blunt! C. Bl. Careless! C. Car. You guess shrewdly; plague, what contrivance Hath set you and I a tilting at one another. C. Bl. How the devil got you a Souldiers habit? C. Car.

The ladder of ropes: how a Gods name got you hither? C. Car. Why, I had the ladder of ropes, and came down by it. C. Bl. Then the mistake is plainer; 'twas I that sent the Souldier with the ropes. Ruth. What an escape was this! come, let's lose no time; Here's no place to explain matters in. C. Car. I will stay to tell thee, I shall never deserve thee. Ruth. Tell me so when you have had me a little while. Come Follow me, put on your plainest garb; not like a Dancing Master, with your toes out.

They'l not stand the first charge, fear not; Now the Day breaks. C. Car. Wou'd 'twere his neck were broke. Enter Mr. Day, and Mrs. Day. Mrs. Day. Ah ha, my fine run-awayes, have I found you; What, you think my Husbands honor lives without intelligence. Marry come up. Mr. Day. My Duck tells you how 'tisâweâ Mrs. Day. Why then let your Duck tell 'um how 'tis; Yet as I was saying, you shall perceive we abound in intelligence; Else 'twere not for us to go about to keep the Nation Quiet; but if you Mrs. Arbella will deliver up what you have Stolen, and submit, and return with us, and this ungracious Ruth. Ruth. Anne if you please. Mrs. Day. Who gave you that name pray? Ruth. My God-fathers and God-mothers in Baptism; on for Sir, I can answer a leaf farther. Mr. Day. Duck, good Duck a word; I do not like this Name Annice. Mrs. Day. You are ever in a fright, with a shrivell'd heart Of your own. Well Gentlewomen, you are merry. Arb. As newly come out of our Wardships, I hope Mr. Abel is well Mrs. Day. Yes, he is well, you shall see him presently; Yes, you shall see him. C. Car. That is with Mirmidans, come good Anne no more Delay, fall on. Ruth. Then before the furious Abel approaches with his Red-Coats, who perhaps are now marching under the conduct Of that expert Captain in weighty matters; know the Articles Of our Treaty are only these: This Arbella will keep her Estate, and not marry Abel, but this Gentlemen; and I Anne, Daughter to Sir Basil Throughgood, and not Ruth, As has been thought, have taken my own Estate, Together with this Gentleman, for better for worse: we were Modest, though thieves, only plundred our own. Mrs. Day. Yes Gentlewoman, you took something else, And that my Husband can prove; it may cost you your necks If you do not submit. Ruth. Truth on't is, we did take something else. Mrs. Day. Oh, did you so. Ruth. Pray give me leave to speak one word in private With my Father Day? Mrs. Day. Do so, do so; are you going to compound? Oh, 'tis Father Day now. Ruth. D'hear Sir, how long is't since you have practis'd Physick? [Takes him aside. Mr. Day. Physick, what d'ye mean? Ruth. I mean Physick; look ye here's a small prescription Of yours: d'ye know this hand writing? Mr. Day. I am undone. Ruth. Here's another upon the same subject; this young one I Believ came into this wicked world for want of your preventing Dose; it will not be taken now neither; it seems your wenches Are wilful: nay, I do not wonder to see 'um have more Conscience then you have. Mr. Day. Peace good Mrs. Anne, I am undone if you betray me. Enter Abel, goes to his Father. Abel. The Souldiers are come. Mr. Day. Go and send 'um away Abel; here's no need, No need now. Mrs. Day. Are the Souldiers come, Abel? Abel. Yes, but my Father biddeth me send 'um away. Mr. Day. No, not without your opinion Duck; but since They have but their own, I think Duck if we were all friends. Mrs. Day. O, are you at your ifs again; d'you think they Shall make a fool of me, though they make an ass of you: Call 'um up Abel, if they will not submit; Call up the Souldiers Abel. Ruth. Why your fierce Honor shall know the business That makes the wise Mr. Day inclinable to friendship. Mr. Day. Nay good sweet heart come, I pray let us be friends. Mrs. Day. How's this! what am not I fit to to be trusted now? Have you built your credit and reputation upon my council And labours, and am not I fit now to be trusted? Mr. Day. Nay, good sweet Duck, I confess I owe All to thy wisdom. Good Gentlemen perswade my Duck That we may be all friends. C. Car. Hark you good Gillian Day, be not so fierce upon The Husband of thy bosom; 'twas but a small start of frailty; Say it were a wench, or so? Ruth. As I live he has hit upon't by chance: now we Shall have sport. [Aside Mrs. Day. How, a wench, a wench! out upon the Hypocrite. A wench! was not I sufficient? a wench! I'le be reveng'd, Let him be ashamed if he will: call the Souldiers Abel. C. Car. Haste, good Abel, march not off so hastily. Arb. Soft, gentle Abel, or I'le discover, you are in Bonds; You shall never be released if you move a step. Ruth. D'hear, Mrs. Day, be not so furious, hold your peace; You may divulge your Husbands shame if you are so simple, And cast him out of authority, nay and have him tri'd for His life: read this, remember too I know of your bribery And cheating, and something else: you guess, be friends And forgive one another; here's a Letter counterfeited From the King, to bestow preferment upon Mr. Day, if He would turn honest; by which means I suppose you Cousened your Brother Cheats, in which he was to remember His service to you; I believe 'twas your indicting: you are the Committee man, 'tis your best way: nay, never demur; So, kiss and be friends. Now if you can contrive handsomly To cozen those that cozen all the world, and get these Gentlemen to come by their Estates easily, and without Taking the Covenant, the old Sum of five hundred pound That I used to talk of, shall be yours yet. Mrs. Day. We will endeavour. Ruth. Come Mrs. Arbella, pray let's all be friends. Arb. With all my heart. Ruth. Brethren, Abel, the Bird is flown, but you shall be Released from your bonds. Abel. I bear my afflictions as I may. Enter Teg leading Obadiah in a halter, and Musician. Teg. What is this now? who are you? well, are not you Mrs. Tay? well, I will tell her what I should say now? Shall I then? I will try if I cannot laugh too, as I did, that I will. C. Car. No, good Teg, there's no need of thy message now; But why do'st thou lead Obadiah thus? Teg. Well, I will hang him presently, that I will; look you Here Mrs. Tay, here's your man Obadiah, do you see that now? He wou'd not let me make him drunk; no more that He wou'd not; so, I did take him in this string, and I did tell Him if he did make noises, I wou'd put the knife into Him, that I wou'd upon my soul. C. Bl. Honest Teg, thy Master is beholding to thee in some Measure for his liberty. C. Car. Teg, I shall requite thy honesty. Teg. Well, shall I hang him then? It is a rogue now; who Wou'd not be drunk, that he wou'd not. Obad. I do beseech you Gentlemen let me not Be brought unto death? C. Car. No poor Teg, 'tis enough we are all friends; Come, let him go. Teg. Well, he shall go then; but you shall love the King, Or I will hang you another time, that I will by my soul. Well, Look you here now, here is the man that sung you the Song, That he is; I met him as I came, and I bid him come hither And sing for the King, that I did. C. Car. D'hear my friends, is any of your companions With you? Mu. Yes Sir. C. Car. As I live we'l all dance; it shall be the celebration Of our Weddings: nay, Mr. Day, as we hope to continue Friends, you and your Duck shall trip it too. Teg. I by my soul will we; Obadiah shall be my woman too, And you shall dance for the King, that you shall. C. Car. Go and strike up then, no chiding now Mrs. Day; Come, you must not be refractory for once. Mrs. Day. Well Husband, since these Gentlemen will have It so, and that they may perceive we are friends, Dance. C. Bl. Now Mr. Day to your business, get it done as soon as You will, the five hundred pound shall be ready. C. Car. So friends thank honest Teg, thou shalt flourish In a new Livery for this: Now Mrs. Annice, I hope you and I may agree about kissing, and compound every way. Now Mr. Day, if you will have good luck in every thing, Turn Cavalier, and cry, God bless the King. [Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. But now the greatest thing is left to do, More just Committee, to Compound with you; For, till your equal censures shall be known, The Poet's under Sequestration: He has no Title to his small Estate Of Wit, unless you please to set the Rate. Accept this half years purchase of his Wit, For in the compass of that time 'twas Writ: Not that this is enough, he'l pay you more, If you your selves believe him not too poor: For 'tis your judgements gives him wealth, in this, Hee's just as rich as you believe he is. Wou'd all Committees cou'd have done like you, Made men more rich, and by their payments too. FINIS.</field>
