      <field name="fulltext">CHARACTERS. ORESTES. PYLADES. EGYSTHUS. ELECTRA. CLYTEMNESTRA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Stage represents an open space near the Palace, and the Temple of PhÅbus in Argos.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. ORESTES. Now has the great predestined day arriv'd, When by thy aid, O ever-radiant PhÅbus, Orestes must his destiny fulfil. Tremendous destiny! that gives my hand The matricidal knife!âMake firm my heart, And to th'avenging of my father's death, On her that bore me, grant such note and fame To the dread act, that never guilt again, Like Clytemnestra's, may surprize the world. O Agamemnon! my heroic sire! Could not the charm of thy atchiev'd renown Restrain th'adultress!âScarce from Troy return'd, To be so murder'd,âand myself, poor babe! To clear the kingdom for the lewd Egysthus, Before my birth was sentenced to be slain, But by the nurse who had my father rear'd, Sav'd; and while yet unswaddled, sent by night To my sad uncle's court. His kindly care Bred me to manhood; but the Gods convinc'd My early youth that they had work for me. Blood will have blood. My father's claims the blow, And my own wrongs extenuate the deed. SCENE II. Orestes and Pylades. ORESTES. Well, my Pylades, have you seen my sister? How does she fare in the maternal brothel? PYLADES. As a bright jewel among offal cast, Her native purity remains unchang'd. She lives apart a pious pensive life, And weeps unheard her guilty mother's sin. ORESTES. And what of her, and the abhorr'd Egysthus? PYLADES. Rather than ask, imagine. Nothing chang'd Is the wild flame of Clytemnestra's passion; Though every day th'opprobrious paramour, Insulting nature might provoke her scorn. ORESTES. And does my sister but bewail the guilt? A loftier spirit better would become, Atrides issue and exalted blood. PYLADES. But gentle is the fair Electra's soul, And in her bosom, full of heavy sorrow, The vex of indignation never stirs.â Her meek and unrepining spirit shows A holy brightness in its clouded sphere; Like the pale moon that on the vapoury earth, Sheds without heat the pure celestial light. ORESTES. Methinks I should have more courageous felt, Did she possess the temper of revenge To urge me if I shrunk. PYLADES. Have I not sworn To bear my part, in this just enterprize, Against Egysthus? ORESTES. âBut high fate ordains A greater act; and Agamemnon's shade Demands a sacrifice to match his death. PYLADES. What mean you? ORESTES. âJustice. PYLADES. How! ORESTES. Full retribution. PYLADES. On whom? ORESTES. The guilty. PYLADES. What! your mother? ORESTES. Yes.â Why turn you pale and look on me so strange? I am Orestes! Agamemnon's son! With him th'immortal halo first was thrown, Around the helmed head of bloody war; And men, up-rising from their sordid aims, Were taught that wounds, yea death itself was gain, When found in battle fought but for renown. The unborn races of the utmost times, The last circumf'rence of posterity, Will sound applause to Agamemnon's name. But he, with all his glory in its noon, Was, by the demon of accurst desire, Torn from his sphere, and like a falling star, Extinguish'd in the world's astonished gaze; And should not such a crime be all reveng'd? PYLADES. Think, Clytemnestra is your mother,âthink. ORESTES. But justice no propinquity respects; And fate, by all the tenour of my life, Has shown me fashion'd for a solemn end. Know! Heav'n at times sends forth predestined men To stir the world, and from the sensual foul To cleanse th'immortal element of thought. Of such were Hercules and Theseus. What toils they bore to rid the earth o'errun, With hideous offspring of perverted passion! My conscious spirit claims to rank itself With their high phalanx, and by some great act To give an epocha to history; That sages wond'ring o'er the past may say, âSuch was the world before Orestes' time; But his high-aim'd atchievement changing all; Crimes, bold and catching once, like strange diseases, Grew mild and vanish'd from the frame of man.â PYLADES. Sublime! Incomprehensible! This strange And warm enthusiasm that pervades Thy lofty spirit, has transform'd thy nature, Lighting a purpose dark and terrible, With such a flame of holy charity, That I am aw'd, and tremble at thy virtue. Thou art no more, Orestes! he with whom My youthful pastimes were so gaily spent! But I have sworn to be as true to this, In his great business, as his own right hand.â Lo, where your sister, fair Electra comes. SCENE III. Electra, Orestes, and Pylades. ELECTRA. My noble brotherâ ORESTES. Rise, Electra, rise: Too long the daughter of the king of heroes, Has bent in lowliness and pined forlorn. Why knelt you thus to me? ELECTRA. Your mien, Orestes, O'erawes my spirit; and my heart foregone, The joyous throb with which I sought you here, Stands in my bosom, fearful and restrained, As if I saw, incarnated in you, The energy of an avenging God. But wherefore here, at this most perilous hour? This is the portico of PhÅbus' temple.â ORESTES. Hail holy temple of my guardian God! ELECTRA. And daily, as the sun ascends to noon, The vot'ries still their pious visits pay. But though no more the guilty court esteems The God or worship, here Egysthus's spies, Keep constant watch, and list with greedy ear, E'en to the tenour of the pilgrim's prayer. Retire my brother; shun their deadly sight; Come when 'tis dark, and I will meet you then. ORESTES. I know the danger, but I trust the Gods And my own destiny. Full well I know, That the usurper, conscious of his crimes, And dreading retribution, has contrived A subtile and infernal enginry, To crush the fruit of justice in the germ. ELECTRA. There's not a place it does not penetrate. The sacred temples hold the tyrant's echoes.â Know you, Egysthus has already heard The number and equipment of your men? ORESTES. But of our enterprize he cannot know. PYLADES. Rumour is taught, that we advance ourselves In quest of labours and romantic feats. ORESTES. Has not Egysthus heard of this? ELECTRA. He has. ORESTES. And laughs at us? PYLADES. Is it not so, Electra? ELECTRA. I never enter in the Tyrant's circle. My feminine and simple pray'r is still, That all your purposes may be for good, And for their aim, be prosper'd by the Gods. ORESTES. What! though they mock at us, my dear Pylades, They know us not, nor can their downward thoughts Conceive the scope and motives of our daring. Let them laugh on, while we pass to the goal Of our magnificent and awful purpose. ELECTRA. But here, Orestes, do not linger now. The very air is here a whisperer; And as the viewless arrows of the pest, The unknown ministers of vengeance speed, And give the death before the victims feel, Or fear themselves infected.âStay not here. ORESTES. You must, Electra, then be spy for us. The troops are waiting in the mountain pass, With all prepared, the signals and the signs. Pylades, safe in his disguise, will here Attend your intimations. In the temple, I will the anxious interval employ. SCENE IV. Electra and Pylades. ELECTRA. Come, gentle cousin, let me lean on thee. My heart shrinks in me. All the glowing joy With which I heard Orestes was arrived, Is changed into a chilling apprehension. PYLADES. Be more of heart; take courage from the hope That leads our bold adventure. Rouse yourself With the remembrance of your injuries. ELECTRA. I have so long on bitter sorrow fared, That hope which should with chearfulness inspire, Like opiates, faithless to the fever'd brain, Has heighten'd my disease. If ye should fail, What may the fell usurper not attempt? Already, from my lost unhappy mother, His eye regardless roves; and I have felt With sad abhorrence, his impassioned glance, Flame on my conscious cheek. PYLADES. This day, Electra, Will end your suffering and rebuild your fortune. ELECTRA. Yes; or forever desolate my hopes. I was the worshipp'd daughter of a king, But now I am below all slavery! PYLADES. Why yield you, gentle, to this sickly thought; The cloud that has so long obscur'd your lustre, Is swiftly passing, and the world again Will own your regal brightness. ELECTRA. Ah Pylades; Fortune may change the hues of outward show, But cannot 'raze the truths engraven here. PYLADES. Ha! Who is this? ELECTRA. Egysthus! save yourself! SCENE V. Egysthus and Electra. EGYSTHUS. Why turn you from me, and deny my sight, The Heav'nly radiance of your gentle eyes? What, though Orestes be no more?â ELECTRA. What he? EGYSTHUS. So says the rumour. Flesh is frail and mortal. Nor tears, nor love itself that conquers all, Can bribe the stern and greedy miser, Death, E'er to unlock the coffer of the grave, And give one jewel from his hoarded treasures. ELECTRA. When did he die? How came the tidings here? EGYSTHUS. 'Tis said, that he, gone errant with Pylades, Fell in some battle near the spartan border. ELECTRA. If he fell nobly, he fell not too soon. What is there here, in this rude world of time, But shocks, and turbulence, and pain, and sorrow. EGYSTHUS. You seem content, nor look as one that hears Such tidings of a brother. How is this? ELECTRA. He had but tasted bitterness and grief; What joy had he to lose? What cause have I To mourn for one that has escaped from woe? EGYSTHUS. Ah, pensive fair; could I but minister To thy solace, and from this chance of fate, Draw hope or comfort to a lover's heart! ELECTRA. What would you, sir? I pray you, let me pass. EGYSTHUS. Console you; and in sympathy unite, My kindest soothing to allay your sorrow. ELECTRA. My mother, sir, needs more your consolation.â I pray unhand me, that I may retire? EGYSTHUS. Sweetest Electra, why so shy and perverse? Why would'st thou tear from me, thy gentle hand? Why, with thy scorn, so harshly wring my heart; My wounded heart, that but thy smiles can cure! ELECTRA. Abhorr'd Incestuous! Heav'n! give me strength To shake the monster from his loathsome hold. EGYSTHUS. This maiden artifice improves thy beauties. Me-thinks the virgin glow upon thy cheek, Deepens to ripeness, tempting to be gathered.â O sure, these nimble sparklings of thine eyes, Glance more of love than scorn. ELECTRA. Hence! dreadful man. O Gods! by what unnat'ral transmutation Of nature and of reason, does this wretch, Foul with my father's blood, and from the couch Of my ill-fated mother, newly risen, Breathe this pollution in my tingling ears. EGYSTHUS. Less indignation, fair, disdainful maid. Orestes' death leaves me free king of Argos, And what I will, I may.â ELECTRA. Orestes' death! Think'st thou, the righteous and tremendous Gods, Had only him to be thy punisher? Tyrant! beware and tremble; on thee fast Rolls the inevitable vengeance down, Like burning lava, dark, with clouds o'erspread. SCENE VI. Clytemnestra and Egysthus. CLYTEMNESTRA. Dearest Egysthus! now art thou all king. The rabble vulgar, who refused the name, Will, at the tidings of Orestes' death, Confer it freely. EGYSTHUS. Thou hast a stout heart, To wear such blithesome ruddy on thy cheeks, When tears should bleach them for a gallant son. CLYTEMNESTRA. Alas! you ill requite me. Oh! Egysthus, The masterful and cherish'd love for thee, Has drained the mother's nature from my breast. Have I not doted so intensely on thee, That all regard of duty, vows, and fame, Have been as vile impediments push'd by, That I might take thee with a larger grasp? EGYSTHUS. Come, come, dear wife; take not my words so sadly, I meant no taunt. CLYTEMNESTRA. But I, with anxious pain, See oft thy eyes to other women stray. EGYSTHUS. No chidings, dame.âIf this day's news prove true, I'll make our Argos blaze, as bright again As on your wedding-day with Agamemnon. CLYTEMNESTRA. Why name him to me? Oh! let him, Egysthus, Lie quiet in that bloody sepulchre, Where we, untimely laid him. His grim shade That nightly visits my perturbed sleep, Needs not the aid of your remorseless slight, To barb its dread reproach. EGYSTHUS. What, penitent! Now, this is but a woman's shallow trick, To hide your jealousy. Dear Clytemnestra, Love, once departed, will not come again, By showing him the chaff of former fare. Cupid has wings, the poets say, to fly: Though, like the bee, he roves from flower to flower, He will not always feed on cloying sweet. Knowest thou, fair, that fondness may grow flat, And smack of staleness too, yea turn to sour. Come! learn philosophy; 'tis time you should. CLYTEMNESTRA. 'Tis time, indeed, when I am taught by you!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. ORESTES. I am as one that swims a river's tideâ Swept by the stream, my efforts all in vain. O that I never had been born! or that The fate-controuling Deities had held My mother from her crimes. Had she but shed One glimpse of kindness on my helpless childhood; One smile, such as the nursing menial smiles, In simple-hearted fondness on the babe; I might have felt some soft-restraining tie. But Fate, which has with dreadful parricide, Incarnadin'd my destiny, appears By the great plea of her deficiencies, To blanch the horror of it from my mind;â So large and universal has the want Of all maternal been in her to me. SCENE II. Orestes, Electra and Pylades. ORESTES. How now Pylades? And Electra here! Is this a time for wooing blandishments? I thought my friend had been of purer mould, Than in the turn and crisis of my life, To yield to such soft weakness. ELECTRA. âOh Orestes!â ORESTES. And thou too damsel, dar'st thou entertain The smiling flatt'ry of a lover's suit, While Heav'ns great ministers are all astir, And on their thrones, th'eternal Gods themselves Stand up expectant of a dreadful scene,â Th'avenging of thy sire? His restless shade Walks round us here, and frowns to see thee thus. PYLADES. Forbear Orestes; this unjust reproachâ Electra seeks but to escape the foul And insolent Egysthus. ORESTES. Say'st thou so? ELECTRA. Oft has he glanc'd from his presumptuous eyes A fervent, strange familiarity, That thrill'd in horror through my trembling frame. PYLADES. To-day embolden'd by the rumour'd fiction Of our defeat and fall in Lacedemon, He dar'd to give his hideous passion words. ORESTES. Lie quiet yet awhile, impatient Sword! Thou see'st, Pylades, 'tis as I have said; My destiny is clear. What monstrous shames Are rife among us: but, the end is come. Behold in Heav'n th'appointed sign display'd. The sun is smitten with the promis'd darkness; And when the gloom is rounded and compleat, Then shall be done that dread predestin'd deed, Which, ever sounding to the utmost time, Will wake the echoes of posterity! ELECTRA. O ye deep-working and mysterious Powers! That 'tend on nature, in this great probation, Sustain my weakness. PYLADES. By what prescience, Hast thou, Orestes, known the coming on Of this portentous sign; thus to unite The issue of our purpose and the omen? Though we have grown from boyhood up together, Shar'd the same sports, the same instruction drawn, Slept in one chamber, at one table far'd, And been in all things free and confident, As if one mind our sev'ral natures sway'd, 'Till the first scheme of this thy high intent; Thou dost my thoughts with wonder so amaze, That while I should thee better know than others, There is no other still so strange to me. ORESTES. Do you remember ought that chanc'd to us Upon the day of that recorded night, On which you swore to link your fate to mine, In the great enterprize that brings us here? PYLADES. Were we not hunting the nemean boar, With certain nobles of my father's court? ORESTES. Ay, and had pitch'd our tents upon the hill, Fronting the sea-indented Salamis. PYLADES. I have the spot all painted in my mind. 'Twas scarce a bow-shot from the little temple, Which an old mariner of Negara, In gratitude for some escape at sea, Had rais'd to Neptune and the God of day, Serving their rites himself. And now I think, You came not with us to the woods that day, But went to see the hoary mariner. ORESTES. Him often since I have re-visited. PYLADES. When I return'd, I found you sad and moody, And then it was you spoke of this design. ORESTES. That antient mariner had in his day, Seen many wonders of the sea and land, And learnt mirac'lous science. He had pass'd Beyond th'Aurora of our western world, To where the orient kings on opal walk: And with the bold PhÅnecians he had sail'd, To where the long-foreseeing Druids teach The untamed Britons, that within the oak, The guardian spirit of their isle resides. Deep was he vers'd in starry processes, And could predict by hieroglyphic skill, The fortunes and the accidents of men. Seeing me thoughtful and diseased at heart To be this offcast from the ties of nature, He ey'd me kindly, often question'd me With curious inquisition, and essay'd To find if ever in my youthful breast, Insidious Love had its sedition sown. When he had found me honest, free and chaste, He took his tablets, and by mystic signs, And antique emblems keenly scrutinized, Told me that fate had form'd me to avenge My father's death, and Heav'ns justice deal Against my guilty mother:âbidding me, Momentous aspects of the air and sky, Nightly to note; nor to advance myself, Till thrice three hundred days were past and gone. Then if my resolution lasted firm, To be at Argos on this day prepar'd; When glorious PhÅbus in the bright of noon, Would veil his light, in signal of approval. And lo! the God assumes the gloom predicted! PYLADES. How was't you told me not of this before? ORESTES. My heart long doubtful, scarcely to this hour Was nerv'd for the dread feat. But yon eclipse Has all the wav'ring hues of hesitation, By its deep influence fix'd in one black. ELECTRA. Ha! fly Orestesâhasten from this spot. It is the queen that comes. ORESTES. âOh! Gods! my mother! Retire Pylades; let me look at her. SCENE III. Orestes and Electra. ORESTES. Oh! that the Heav'ns should in a form so noble, Have lodg'd a heart so foul. Majestic ruin! Fain would I bend the filial knee before thee, But the stern purpose that I come upon Stifles the new-felt rev'rence as it stirs. O mother, mother, did my melting soul Retain one trace, but one of kindness from thee, I would my terrible intent forego, And at thy feet contend with destiny. SCENE IV. Clytemnestra and Electra. (Orestes apart.) CLYTEMNESTRA. Canst thou unmov'd behold the God of day, Shorn of his glory in the bright of noon? The dark'ning prodigy still spreads apace. The town is forth; and from the palace tower The streets with wan and wond'ring faces seem As thickly pav'd as with the wonted stones; The cheek of life resigns the beauteous bloom, And takes the ghastly ashy of the dead; The hills frown black; the distant sea foregoes Its heav'nly azure for a dismal red; The fields are chang'd, and for their cheerful green Assume a sullen supernat'ral hue; And solitary pasturing herds, in bands, Come to the gates, and seek protecting man. ELECTRA. Portents and omens ever have been held The harbingers of change. Yon black eclipse Is but the forecast frown of some stern God, In wrath descending for his rites profaned. Now may the guilty quake. CLYTEMNESTRA. Whom dost thou mean? What guilty? Whom? Dost thou mean me, Electra? ELECTRA. The conscious heart beneath such augury Confesses to itself. You are the queen, And ought to know; or knowing not should learn, Why this portentous gloom appaling falls. The solemn Gods deal in no idle pageants. CLYTEMNESTRA. 'Twas but the chance of birth that made me queen. I hold from nature no inheritance, Above the frailties of the common race; Food, sleep and pastime are as sweet to me, As to the meanest slave that fears my frown. Then why should I, so palpable to all The ails and accidents of vulgar clay, Believe that Heav'n takes stricter note of me, Because my head sustains a glitt'ring toy, And from my shoulders somewhat fuller hang These two three spans of madder-tinctured robe, Made from the cast-off mantle of a ewe! I am a woman, made with woman's weakness. ELECTRA. My father, Agamemnon, wise men say, Did, by the virtue of his great atchievements, Exalt the aims and motives of mankind: You! O my mother! were his honour'd wife. CLYTEMNESTRA. But he is dead; what is th'eclipse to him? ELECTRA. To him, 'tis true, all changes are alike; The fears that shake us, and the ills that harm, Effectless pass o'er his oblivious dust. CLYTEMNESTRA. Electra! wherefore do you taunt me so? ELECTRA. Alas! I only mourn my father dead. CLYTEMNESTRA. Maiden! how now? Dost thou forget thy mother? ELECTRA. Were you not too the mother of Orestes? CLYTEMNESTRA. Art thou my child, and dar'st upbraid me so? ELECTRA. The rude accuser wakes within yourself! My heart weeps blood; and when I turn my eyes To yon portentous blotting of the noon, And think what dire reverse of moral nature Reigns in our Argos, terror fills my breast. CLYTEMNESTRA. My child, my child, you sorely probe my heart; Nor longer can I, to myself, appease The terrible conviction of my guilt. It flames before me, fierce as Phlegethon; And now me-thinks I see, rising around, The hideous brood of Acheron and Chaos, Rearing their fiery snakes to drive me hence.â Oh! my Electra, fain my blushing soul Would make confession of its shame to thee; But never can thy gentle spirit know, The dreadful contest that is rending mine. To-day, Egysthus, whose departed love I long have miss'd, in many cold neglects, Has scorn'd me openly, e'en while I felt Unnat'ral joy, that, by Orestes's death, He might possess an unmolested throne. ELECTRA. And he, to-day, made horrible my hearing, With hideous proffer of detested love. CLYTEMNESTRA. Egysthus! love! did'st thou say, love to thee? Art thou Electra, not the child I bore?â O monster! monster! But all falls astray, And noon turn'd night, is the least fearful change. Strike! Heav'n, strike! and let me know no more. Wilt thou submit thee to his curs'd embrace? I'll tear thee from him like a hungry tyger; Rive thee to joints; and on thy father's tomb, Burn thy unhallow'd and incestuous bones, To pacify the pale repining shade. Oh! Agamemnon, thou art well reveng'd. ELECTRA. Orestes nears and waves me to retire. ORESTES. Hail Clytemnestra! royal murd'ress hail! CLYTEMNESTRA. Do I not dream; or what dread sounds are these? Comes Agamemnon from the tomb to chide? ORESTES. Orestes' mother, hail! or by thy honour'd title, Egysthus' dame! must I entice thy ear? CLYTEMNESTRA. Again, O Gods! he comes. ORESTES. Wilt thou not speak? CLYTEMNESTRA. What would'st thou, restless and reproachful ghost? I am prepar'd.âThe spell of sin is o'er, And Conscience wak'ning, wildly rings my doom. ORESTES. Where is thy son? CLYTEMNESTRA. Has he not joined thee yet? ORESTES. He comes! The mighty Gods themselves have plac'd Their gleaming vengeance in his fated grasp. CLYTEMNESTRA. Oh! can my mis'ry yet such bitter want, That I must fall by his unfilial arm? ORESTES. Did'st thou not first, these dire inversions prove? Thou did'st, Unnatural! to-day, rejoice In the reported death of this same son, From whom thou dar'st to claim a mother's rights. Behold how wide the reprobation works! The glorious sun is fading to a blot In the mid Heav'n of noon, as if he shunn'd The pestilence which thy example lewd, Has rais'd in Argos. Know'st thou not, to-day, That thy Egysthus; thy fam'd spouse! Egysthus, Has breath'd the loathsome fervor of his love To thy own daughter? Yet thy doting eyes Look on him fondly. CLYTEMNESTRA. Cease, perturbed shade. To-day, forever from my tortur'd bosom, I cast him forth; and penitence and woe, For all the wretched remnant of my life, Shall feed upon me, till my wasted frame Has done atonement for its guilty passion. ORESTES. Infirm and fleeting that contrition is, Which shame of mortified denial breeds. Springs thine from hatred of thy own desires? CLYTEMNESTRA. Thy scrutinizing inquisition, shows A fearful glass to my convicted soul.â I dare not look on my deformity. Upbraid no more, but with thy deadly hand, Seize and convey me to thy shadowy home. ORESTES. Then yield thyself. CLYTEMNESTRA. O Gods! ELECTRA. She faints; help! help! SCENE V. Clytemnestra, Electra, and Egysthus. CLYTEMNESTRA. Oh! my Electra; and is it away? EGYSTHUS. What Clytemnestra? CLYTEMNESTRA. Ha! com'st thou here too? Avaunt! abhorr'd: there's torment in thy touch. Hence! lest the awful and vindictive ghost, Transform itself into wide-wrapping flame, And mix our ashes in one sudden doom. EGYSTHUS. What can she mean, Electra? CLYTEMNESTRA. Is it so? And dar'st thou woo her in my very sight? Blaze forth again to vision, dreadful form, And save thy innocent and blameless child, From the enchanting venom of his tongue.â Deem not thy virtue firmer than thy mother's; For I was bound by holy charm of vows, To one whose name should have been charm enough, Against the conjurations of the sense. Sure, I was drawn, by worse than sorcery, To plot my husband's death, and drench my sleeves Deep in the flowing ruby of his blood. E'en now thy father, all magnificent, Before me stood, as when he sail'd for Troy: His armour sounding as he mov'd along Tow'ring refulgent. In his searching eyes, Me-thought a sad and wat'ry pity hung, That kindly mercified their angry fires. EGYSTHUS. 'Twas but a phantom of thy fever'd fancy: The self same substance as the nightly dreams That chace thy needful sleep. CLYTEMNESTRA. Beware, Egysthus; yet repress the smile That grows to mock'ry on thy jutting lip. Such visitations are not idly made; And see the sun on his meridian throne, Spreads a black signal to the world of men.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Pylades and Orestes. PYLADES. By time it should be nigh the noon of day, But night portentous has usurp'd the sky. All birds are bower'd save witching Hecat's bird, The bat that, in its murky flutter, shrieks A shrill amen to the ill owlet's bode. The sun has dwindled to an edge of light, And seems the glitt'ring remnant of a ring. Heav'n's lamps as in the midnight are lit up: But in the preternatural reverse, That seizes all; their constellated fires Present the aspect of th'autumnal sky. ORESTES. How now, Pylades! art thou stricken too? PYLADES. In truth, Orestes something much like fear, Chilly and pale upon my fancy creeping, Daunts from my heart its wonted confidence. ORESTES. Bear up man, and take courage from the sign; It suits our awful enterprize, and shows The Gods auspicious. What we aim to do, Is such a deed that, with less sanctioning, We might have deem'd it of another stamp. But all these pageants of the ominous sky, Prove that the Heav'ns have interest in our purpose. SCENE II. Orestes, Electra and Pylades. ORESTES. My sister! how is this? What would'st thou here? This is no place now for thee to abide. The troops are posted.âTo thy room again;â Our business ill thy gentle nature suits. ELECTRA. O my Orestes! let me stay with thee. Alone I dare not trust my busy thoughts. Unutterable fears, suggestions dire, And cogitations of unhallow'd scope, In spite of reason glide into my mind. All seems unnat'ral, e'en the Gods are serv'd With rites and worship reprobate and grim. The glorious PhÅbus, like dark HecatÃ©, Is hail'd in orgies ghastly and obscure: The fearful crowds with torches glaring flame, Rush to his temple; howling and sad cries Are heard for tuneful hymns; and clotted gore Of felon victims, manacled with iron, Dragg'd from the dungeons and in fury torn, Besmear the silver altars of the God. PYLADES. Gentle Electra droop not so dismay'd. ORESTES. You know not yet the soul-inspiring cheer Of these celestial assurances. By such dread prodigies in heav'n and earth Mysterious providence controuls mankind. Let no one say such things are negative. ELECTRA. Thy mind, dear brother, teems with dark conceits. I understand thee not, or wish I may not. ORESTES. Go to thy chamber, and abide our call. Pylades lead her.âI will to the men, Lest they too catch the horror of the time. SCENE III. Electra and Pylades. ELECTRA. I will not go, Pylades; rather here Let me be witness to the worst I think, Than haunted by the demon of my fears. O that I could but freely speak to him! But when I would he seems to look on me, With such endurance as a mother views, The aimless pastime of her ideot child. PYLADES. What would you say to him? would you restrain The mighty justice that has brought him here? ELECTRA. I think Orestes has a mind most noble?â PYLADES. Truly so, and virtuous passing man. ELECTRA. 'Tis but the height of his stupendous worth, That breeds in me this terrible alarm. PYLADES. He to the acts of his decided purpose, Moves with the equanimity of Jove. Sweet! what is this? Why spring these sudden tears? ELECTRA. When the heart's full the eyes will overflow.â Alas! that I should yield to such conceits. PYLADES. To what, Electra? ELECTRA. Ever to suspect The sanctity of his superior nature. Why should his heav'nly magnanimity Beget in me this fear. PYLADES. Fear! how? What fear? ELECTRA. O why, Pylades, does his moody thought Seem less against the doom'd Egysthus bent, Than on the guilt of his unhappy mother; And this magnificence of sign and omen? PYLADES. He views Egysthus as the murd'rous knife: But Clytemnestra was the urging hand. ELECTRA. O that he were not so juridical!â You are his friend, his bosom friend, Pylades; The full confided partner of his thoughtsâ PYLADES. Ha! wherefore trembling grasp you thus my arm. ELECTRA. Answer me truly. PYLADES. âWhat would you, Electra? ELECTRA. Oh sure, Oh sure, we have had crimes enough. PYLADES. Alas!â ELECTRA. Then it is so!âO gentle Death! Shut up my sense from this catastrophe. SCENE IV. Orestes, Pylades, and Electra. ORESTES. Still here, Pylades! with Electra here! How now Infirm! Is this thy vow to me? And thou, pale girl, why would'st thou wond'ring stand In the great thoroughfare of Fate and Death? Hence to thy distaff or to pray'r. Pylades, Look how the sun is to a twinkle shrunk. When all is quench'd to our terrestrial vision, I'll strike upon my shield. Be you prepar'd, For at the signal's sound, the men, behind The colonades, will to the storming rush. ELECTRA. Orestes, O my brother!â ORESTES. How! still here! Into the temple, child, or to thy chamber. Here is no place for thee, nor time for wordsâ Ha! who are these that from the palace come?â Swift to thy post, PyladesâI to mine. SCENE V. ELECTRA. O ye dread deities, this work is yours! It is my wretched mother, and Egysthus, Sent helpless here for their own sacrifice; With all the train of pliant priests that gave A guilty acquiescence to their sin. Alas! alas! with what despairing looks, She frequent turns, and eyes the blacken'd sun: Herself too chang'd from all imperial show. SCENE VI. Clytemnestra, Egysthus, Electra, Priests and Torch-Bearers. CLYTEMNESTRA. Electra, O Electra, stand'st thou here With thy undaunted innocence to shame us! Look on her now, and if thou can'st, Egysthus, Beneath these dismal prodigies of Heaven, Find courage still to love, now woo and win. SCENE VII. Clytemnestra, Egysthus, Electra, Orestes, and Pylades. CLYTEMNESTRA. Ha! Agamemnon, come again to chide!â EGYSTHUS. Who? What art thou? ELECTRA. O mother, 'tis Orestes. EGYSTHUS. Orestes! and alive! CLYTEMNESTRA. 'Twas then no vision! EGYSTHUS. Guards! guards! ELECTRA. Fly, mother, fly. CLYTEMNESTRA. Am I awake! What means this clang, like Jove's own thunder peal? EGYSTHUS. Has he sown here the Theban's dragon teeth, That these grim soldiers in full panoply, Start up around us like an apparition? ORESTES. Pylades seize him! EGYSTHUS. First secure thyself.â ORESTES. Audacious dog! and darest thou strike at me? CLYTEMNESTRA. Spare him, Orestes, O in mercy spareâ ORESTES. Ill-fated sure art thou to use the word! Mercy to him by whose accursed stroke, My royal father in his glory fell! Mercy to him by whose detested wiles, My mother was unmother'd to myself! Mercy to him who with incestuous pray'r, Did the chaste hearing of thy child amaze! No: cruelty by every fury mixt.â Die monster, die!âNow murderess prepareâ ELECTRA. Pylades! O Pylades! yet arrestâ CLYTEMNESTRA. Orestes! son! what would'st thou do to me?â PYLADES. O stay, O stay, the parricidal blow.â If the dread Gods for their offended justice Demand atonement, they have power to take, Without the horror of thy agency. 'Tis not for thee, so knit by the great ties Of blood and nature, thus, for her offence, To bear the warrant, or to strike the doom. ORESTES. Pylades! when I first proposed to thee, This work of justice that we now perform, Thou did'st, by all the deities of Light, And each particular energy of Hell, Nam'd one by one, swear to proceed with me, To the extremest verge of my intent, As willing, ready, and commandable As this my own right hand. Such was thy oath. PYLADES. It was, Orestes; but my fancy never Conceiv'd the aim of thy revenge was this. ORESTES. Does the right hand remonstrate with the will? Does it make wherefores at its work? Were I To bid thee, in this wretched woman's bosom, Strike deep the irremediable dagger; Art thou not bound to do't? PYLADES. Oh! my Orestes, Put not upon me such a dreadful task. ORESTES. Thou wast too valiant in thy vow, Pylades! Turn my Electra, turn thy head aside: Thou hast not courage to behold the blow. CLYTEMNESTRA. Strike! strike, at one, nor torture with delay, ELECTRA. O look, Orestes, where Egysthus lies, Stiff'ning in death and clotted with his gore. No more to him can our ill-fated mother Relapse in fondness; spare her then to mourn The woeful issue of her fatal passion;â In piety for her contrition, spare. ORESTES. Thou hast assail'd me with a painful weapon. PYLADES. Yield! yield, Orestes, to this thaw of nature. ORESTES. Mother! CLYTEMNESTRA. O Gods! ORESTES. They wait the sacrifice. CLYTEMNESTRA. Oh! fatal scion, of a fated stock, Whose fruit has still been misery and crime; Is't not enough that I am crimson deep, With the brave blood of my heroic lord, But that my own must curse my offspring too! Hold! impious youth; in thy stern purpose, stay; Think what a claim a parent may put in: 'Tis true that Agamemnon was thy sire; But am not I thy mother, and may urge As just a plea as the lamented dead. ORESTES. If thou hast on me that imperious claim, Which tender mother's o'er their children hold, Then set it forth as I recount to thee, The duties that were thine. The bleating babe, By mystic Nature, naked and defenceless, Is to the mother's charities commended, As much as by the conscious tie of birth. What gentle office hast thou done for me? Hast thou e'er follow'd, with thy hands outstretch'd, In anxious joy upon my tott'ring childhood; Watch'd the first glimpses of my opening mind; And by a wide and all-surrounding love, In soft refraction bent the rays on good? Close as the general interposing air, Is the true mother's anxious vigilance, Around her child: but where was thine to me? As to the bird the shell, thou wast my mother: All cherish, watch, and gentle care were wanting; And as a vile excrescence well remov'd, I was cut off, and destined to destruction. CLYTEMNESTRA. Thou speaking conscience, cease! upbraid no more. If thou wilt spare me, Oh! in pity, cease. Upon her knees, thy weeping mother see; She craves for life, to spend that life in woe. ORESTES. Where was thy pity for my noble sire? Where were thy tears when he before thee lay, Slain victim to thy odious deity, The rank TisiphonÃ©? CLYTEMNESTRA. Alas! Orestes.â Yawn thou firm earth, and give me room to hide From this tremendous and avenging fiend. ELECTRA. Oh! to the temple, to the temple fly. PYLADES. Orestes, stay; thy kindling rage restrain. ORESTES. Away! weak girl. Dar'st thou Pylades too?â Th'eclipse is full!âWho follows me shall die. SCENE VIII. Electra and Pylades. ELECTRA. Oh! coward priests, will you not after him, Nor save e'en your own altars from the stain? Pylades too! canst thou stand shiv'ring here?â O Gods! O Gods! Orestes! Oh! my brother! Rise! rise dread spirit of my father, rise! And scare him from the crime. Egysthus! wake! Hast thou no ghost to blaze upon his sight? Oh! ye that rule the influential stars, Strike down with palsy his uplifted arm! Pylades! Oh Pylades!âHark! hark! hark! PYLADES. 'Tis but the solemn sounding of his tread. ELECTRA. Comes he yet back? PYLADES. Not yet. ELECTRA. What sounds are these? PYLADES. A wail and general lamentation spreads Through all the city. ELECTRA. List.âDid you hear that? ORESTES. On to the altar; to the altar straight! CLYTEMNESTRA. Murderer! matricide, forbear! forbear! ORESTES. The priest of Justice for his victim waits. CLYTEMNESTRA. Ho! you without; will no one help? Help! help! ORESTES. All now were vain. PYLADES. O Heav'ns! she falls, she dies.â 'Tis past, Electra; see th'avenger comes, With ghastly horror, and all grim with gore. SCENE IX. Orestes, Electra, Pylades, &amp;c. ORESTES. Now it is done: and lo, the sun again Emerges from the gloom. Softly around Breaks forth a-joyous universal hail; Why then, Electra and Pylades dear, Stand ye so mute, and look on me so strange? Come, my sweet sister, let me lead thee hence. We are two orphans, and in all the world, Were never woeful orphans more forlorn. ELECTRA. Horrible sight! thy breast is foul with blood; Thy mother's blood!âRelease me awful man. ORESTES. What, my Pylades! where's thy gratulation? Give me thy hand. PYLADES. Oh! what is this? ORESTES. My dagger! Hence! blushing weapon.âOh! could but the sight, So soon, a sworn and sacred friendship sever! Take her, Pylades, she has clung to thee. 'Tis I, 'tis I alone, that am the orphan. But fare ye well; me no fond link detÃ¡ins; I have the world's spacious range before. Cast out in childhood from my mother's breast, Fate from the birth, has destin'd me to be This general denizen; then why should I, At your amaz'd and chilling looks repine. Friends! why is this? They shake their heads and sigh; And, to the temple, gaze, with sad enchantment. What see they there?âPylades, save me! save me! See! see! where o'er my bleeding mother's corse, The snake-hair'd furies of perdition stand. They come, they come, in flaming rage upon me! Ha! Here too! Others! Whither shall I fly? FINIS.</field>
