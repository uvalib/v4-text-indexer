      <field name="fulltext">DRAMATIS PERSONÃ. Ãgisthus. Orestes. Pylades. Clytemnestra. Electra. Soldiers. Followers of Orestes and Pylades.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene,âThe Palace in Argos.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIRST. SCENE THE FIRST. Electra. Elec. Oh fatal, horrible, atrocious night, Oh night, for ever present to my thoughts! Now, for two lustres, every year, I've witness'd, Pall'd in ensanguined darkness, thy return; Yet, 'tis not shed, the expiatory blood, The blood that thou requirest. Oh remembrance! Oh Agamemnon, oh my wretched father! Within these thresholds I beheld thee slain; And by what hand? To his most sacred tomb, Oh night, thou guidest me, by all unseen; Except, indeed, that, ere to-morrow dawn, Ãgisthus do not come to interrupt The tears, which I disconsolately bring In annual tribute to his sacred ashes! The only tribute which I now can give thee Of past affection, and the only pledge Of hope, not yet quite banish'd from my bosom, Of possible revenge. Ah! yes: I swear, If yet I live in Argos, in this palace, Near a flagitious mother, and the slave Of an Ãgisthus, it is that revenge, That possible revenge, and nothing else, That gives me strength t'endure the life I lead. Orestes yet, though far from Argos, lives. 'Twas I that saved thee, brother; and for thee I save myself, until the day arise, When thou shalt shed upon my father's tomb, Not tears, but life-blood of an enemy. SCENE THE SECOND. Clytemnestra, Electra. Cly. Daughter. Elec. What voice is that? Oh heaven! comest thou? Cly. Ah! fly not from me, daughter; I would share With thee the sacred task; in vain Ãgisthus Prohibits me; he will not know it. Come; Let us together to the tomb repair. Elec. Of whom? Cly. Of ... thy ... unhappy ... father. Elec. Ah! Wherefore not say of thy unhappy consort? Thou darest not, and well that fear becomes thee. But how darest thou thy footsteps thither bend, Still with his blood defiled? Cly. Ten years are past Since that atrocious night; ten years I have wept Unceasingly my guilt. Elec. What length of time Can e'er suffice t'atone for such a fault? E'en were thy tears eternal, that were nothing. Dost thou not see it? On these horrid walls Still the coagulated blood-drops stand Which thou hast shed: ah fly; at sight of thee, Behold, it liquifies, and reddens. Fly, Oh thou, whom I ne'er can, nor ought to call My mother: go; return to th'impious bed Of th'infamous Ãgisthus. At his side His consort stand; nor further do advance To trouble Agamemnon's quiet relics. E'en now his terrible, indignant shade Rises against us, and repels thee back. Cly. Thou makest me shudder ... once thou lovedst me ... Oh daughter! ... oh remorse! ... oh agony! Think'st thou I can be happy with Ãgisthus? Elec. Happy? Deservest thou to be happy? Heaven By an indissoluble tie has join'd Vice, infamy, and wretchedness together. Thy agony in fate's eternal archives Hath been from all eternity engraved. Thou only provest yet the first faint symptoms Of future torment: near the dreary waves Of black Cocytus 'tis reserved for thee In all its plenitude. There art thou doom'd To bear the menacing and angry looks Of thy slain consort: there wilt thou behold, On thy arrival, the indignant spectres Of thy forefathers shudder; thou wilt hear The inexorable judge of hell regret, That to thy crime no punishment is equal. Cly. Wretch that I am! What can I ask for? ... pity ... No, that I merit not ... and yet, oh daughter, Could'st thou but see the anguish of my heart ... But who, without abhorrence, could explore The deep recesses of a heart, like mine, Contaminate with so much infamy? I cannot blame thy hatred, or thy rage. In life, already, all the pangs I prove Of baleful Erebus. Scarce had the blow Been by my hand accomplish'd, ere repentance, Swift, but too late, tremendously assail'd me. E'en from that moment, the ensanguined spectre Both day and night before my blasted eyes Horribly rises. Wheresoe'er I move, Preceding me, the phantom I behold Trailing along my desolated path A track of sable blood: 'tis on my bed; 'Tis on my throne; and worse, 'tis in my heart: If, as it seldom happens, I should close, Upon my restless couch, my weary lids, The spectre haunts my dreams; and I behold him Plunge in the wide wounds of his bleeding breast His rabid hands, then wildly draw them forth Dropping with gore, and in a threatening posture, With fingers clench'd, wring them before my face. To horrid nights succeed more horrid days: Thus I exist in a protracted death.â Oh daughter, (for thou art my daughter still, Whate'er I be) weep'st not at pangs like these? Elec. I weep, ... ah yes ... I weepâBut tell me, mother, Dost thou not yet enjoy the usurp'd throne? Does not Ãgisthus with thee also reap The common harvest of your common crime? With thee I should not weep; far less should I Yield credence to thy tears. Go to Ãgisthus; Leave me alone t'accomplish my design. Cly. Oh daughter, hear me; stay a moment longer; I am enough distress'd. I hate myself More than thou hatest me. Too late I knew Ãgisthus ... Ah! ... What do I say? Atrides Scarce was no more, ere fully I discover'd The baseness of his soul; yet still I loved him. I felt, and still I feel, the speechless conflict Of a remorseful love ... Remorse, and love, Unnatural pair, of me alone ye are worthy! ... What recompence Ãgisthus renders me For my delinquency, I clearly see: I see contempt in spurious love conceal'd. But so much am I fall'n, that what atonement Can I now offer for my turpitude, That is not criminal? Elec. A lofty death Atones for every crime. But, since thou hast not The weapon, reeking with thy husband's blood, Against thy bosom hurl'd; since toward thyself Thy parricidal arm hath seem'd to lose Its wonted intrepidity; ah, why Hast thou not turn'd, or turn'st thou not, thy sword Against the bosom of that miscreant, Who takes from thee thy honour, peace, and fame, And his paternal rights from thy Orestes? Cly. Orestes? ... when I hear that name pronounced, In every vein my blood congeals. Elec. My blood Boils in each vein, hearing Orestes' name. Thou feelest now, as such a mother should, A mother's love. But yet Orestes lives. Cly. And may the gods grant him a lengthen'd life. Ah, may he never his incautious feet Toward Argos turn. I am a wretched mother; Even for ever have I from myself Banish'd my son. Alas! I am compell'd, E'en in proportion as I love him, now To supplicate the gods, that they no more May bring him in my sight. Elec. I feel a love Quite opposite to thine. For his return I wish, and weary heaven with prayers to grant it; And in the hope of that return I live. I trust, that one day he will dare to come, As should the son of murder'd Agamemnon. SCENE THE THIRD. Ãgisthus, Clytemnestra, Electra. Ãgis. Doth then the entire day seem short, oh queen, For thy afflictions? Ere the morning's dawn To fresh regrets thou risest? Yield the past To merited oblivion; and consent, By being so thyself, to make me happy. Cly. Thou wishedst but to reign, and now thou reign'st. Now, what solicitude canst feel for me Or for my grief? Eternal is that grief, And that thou knowest. Ãgis. I know well what fount Thus ministers to thee eternal tears. Thou would'st, at all events, preserve Electra; With thy solicitations I complied For thy misfortune and my own. Henceforth That aspect of insufferable grief I from thine eyes will take away: I will Henceforth the palace gladden; and from thence, With her, will banish tears. Elec. Drive me away: Still ever will this palace, where thou dwell'st, Be the abode of tears, What other voice, Save that of lamentation, can be heard Where an Ãgisthus reigns? But it must give Exquisite pleasure to Thyestes' son To see the progeny of Atreus weep. Cly. Daughter ... he is my husband. Ah, reflect, Ãgisthus, that she is my daughter. Ãgis. She? She is the daughter of Atrides. Elec. He? He is Atrides' murderer. Cly. Electra! ... Ãgisthus, pity ... dost thou see that tomb, That horrible tomb ... and art not satisfied? Ãgis. Lady, be more consistent with thyself. Say, whose hand laid Atrides in that tomb? Cly. Fatal rebuke! Can more be wanting now To fill the measure of my bitterness? The very instigator to it, now, Upbraids me for the crime. Elec. Oh new delight! Oh sole delight, with which, for ten years past, My heart has been refresh'd! I see you both A prey to hatred and remorse. At length I the retributory transports hear Of a flagitious love: at length are fled All your illusions; thoroughly ye know Each other. May contempt impel to hate, And hate to further blood. Cly. Oh horrible, But merited denunciatory curse! Oh heaven! ... Ah! ... daughter. Ãgis. From thyself alone Arises all our discord. Such a daughter Well may a mother lose, nor feel herself More childless than before. I might reclaim That which I weakly granted to her prayers; But I am not accustomed to reclaim That which I once have given; not to see thee Suffices to our peace. To-day, I yield thee To the most abject of my slaves as wife. With him thou shalt be banish'd: and shall bring him, Amid the infamy of squalid want, Instead of dowry, thy eternal tears. Elec. Speak'st thou of other infamy than thine? What slave of thine is vile compared with thee? Or more degraded, what? Ãgis. Depart. Elec. I know That thou hast saved my life t'increase my pangs. But, come what may come, this my hand, which heaven Perhaps dooms to lofty purposes... Ãgis. Now go; Once more I say it. Cly. Be thou silent now ... Oh daughter ... go, I pray thee ... Elec. Severed from you, there is no punishment Which equals the annoyance of your presence. SCENE THE FOURTH. Ãgisthus, Clytemnestra. Cly. To hear severe rebukes from every tongue, And merit them! ... Oh life! to thee what death Can ever be compared! Ãgis. Oft have I told thee, That while Electra in our presence stays We ne'er can breathe in peace. 'Tis time, high time, That she were slain: the safety of the state, Thy peace and mine, demand it: furthermore, By her offensive pride she stands condemn'd. But still thy tears entreat me to absolve her. Cease then to oppose her banishment: I will it: And it were utterly in vain for thee To seek t'oppose that will. Cly. Oft have I told thee, Whatever be Electra's destiny, Never 'twixt us, oh never, can be peace: 'Mid apprehension thou, I 'mid remorse; In guilty terrors both, we shall drag on A horrid apprehensive life for ever. Is there another hope? Ãgis. I ne'er look back: I of the future think: I ne'er can be Happy, while of Atrides' seed remains. Orestes lives: in him, with years, matures Hatred towards us: he lives, and lives alone On the dire project of ferocious vengeance. Cly. Wretched! he lives; but far from us, unknown, Helpless, obscure.âAh cruel! to a mother Canst thou lament thus, that her son yet lives? Ãgis. Yes, to a mother, who has slain her husband, Thus I may well lament. That to our love Thou sacrificedst; should'st thou not then this Equally to my safety sacrifice? Cly. Oh thou, ne'er satisfied with blood and crimes! ... Thou hast already caught me in the snare Of feigned regard: thy cruel manners since Too well have proved this truth! Still in my breast, E'en yet a flame too strong, and too sincere, I cherish; and thou knowest this too well! Hence may'st thou judge, if I can fail to love An innocent and only son. What heart Is there so hard as not to weep his lot? Ãgis. Thou who with one blow two did'st immolate. The self-same sword cut off the father's life, And graved, in sable characters of blood, The son's death-warrant.âMy procrastination, Fortune, the subtle foresight of Electra, Have saved Orestes. But what matters that? Darest thou proclaim the innocence of a son, Whose father thou hast slain, whose throne usurped? Cly. Oh words of blood! ... Oh son, deprived of all, Nothing thou givest him, who, of that all Thus robb'd thee, if thou givest not thy life. Ãgis. And, tell me, while he lives, are they secure Who triumph in his spoils? Over thy head His sword for ever hangs. Son of Atrides, The only branch of that flagitious race, Uniting every crime, his fierce revenge Would not alone with my blood be appeased. Anxiety for thee, more than myself, Weighs on my bosom when I think of him. Thou heard'st the dreadful and oracular voice, Predicting, that Orestes would become The murderer of his parents? Wretched mother, That voice belongs to thee; whene'er the power Is mine, I ought t'accelerate his death, Thou to endure it silently. Cly. Alas! ... My blood. ... Ãgis. Orestes is not of thy blood; He is the impure remnant of the blood Of Atreus: a blood to every crime Predestined. Thou his father hast beheld, By impious ambition, hurried on; His daughter, on the altar, immolate. Orestes, treading in his father's steps, Atrides' son, will sacrifice his mother. Mother too blind, and too compassionate! That son now holds himself prepared to slay thee: Behold him; tremble ... Cly. To avenge his father, Suffer him, then, to pierce this guilty breast. Another greater crime, if such there be, Perhaps should atone for mine. But thou, Ãgisthus, Whatever destiny may threaten me, I do conjure thee, by the injured blood Of Agamemnon, do not thou attempt To plot against Orestes. Far from us, And exiled, he may live; but let him live. Orestes would not dare to turn his steps Towards his native country; if he came, My breast should shield him from thy violence. But if he came, 'tis heaven that brings him hither; And who avails 'gainst heaven? What doubt remains? I a predestinated victim am. Ãgis. Awhile refrain from tears. Orestes lives: And I but faintly hope that in my power He ever will be found. But if the day Should e'er arrive, when I indeed suffice To consummate a necessary deed, Which thou in vain call'st criminal, that day Thou shalt, if so thou wilt, resume thy tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE SECOND. SCENE THE FIRST. Orestes, Pylades. Ores. This is my palace, Pylades.âOh joy! Beloved Pylades, embrace me; now The day at length arises, when I may Relieve thee from thy long calamities Endured in my behalf. Py. Love me, Orestes; Listen to my advice; this, this alone Is the relief that for myself I ask. Ores. At last we are arrived.âHere reigns Ãgisthus; Here Agamemnon fell by murderous hands. This palace, though I left it but a child, Is yet familiar to me. Just heaven in time Conducts me hither. Twice five years have past, This very night, have past, since, slain by treachery, My father made these palace walls resound With dolorous cries. Oh! well I recollect it. Electra, swiftly through this very court, Carried me thither, where, with pitying arms, Strophius received me, who, no less to me Than to thyself, has proved himself a father. And he, all trembling, through that secret gate Fled with me; and behind me there resounded A long confusion of lamenting voices, Which made me weep, and shriek aloud, and tremble, I knew not why. Strophius, who wept himself, Smothering my howlings with his hand, embraced me, And with his bitter tears bedewed my face; He to the solitary shore, where late We landed, meanwhile with his burden came, And to the prosp'rous winds unreef'd his sails. In manhood I return, at length in manhood; Of hope, of courage, anger, and revenge, Full I return, whence I departed once, Weeping, a helpless child. Py. Here reigns Ãgisthus; And here, with fearless voice, thou speak'st of vengeance? Incautious! Dost thou such beginning give To such an enterprise? Thou see'st already The morning dawns; and even yet if night Here reign'd for ever, these are palace walls; Speak, then, in whispers: every wall may hide A spy beneath its shade. Ah let us not Now lose the harvest of so many vows, And of so many wanderings that, at length, After such danger, to these shores conduct us. Ores. Oh sacred shores! 'tis true, it seem'd to me, That unknown powers from you repell'd me back: Since we from Crissa had our anchor loosed, The winds seem'd always to forbid my progress Towards my native shores. New obstacles By thousands and by thousands always rising; New perils made me tremble, that the day Would never come when I should plant my foot In Argos. But that day at length is comeâ I am in Argos. If I have surmounted, Beloved Pylades, all forms of danger, To thee, and thy inflexible regard, Do I ascribe it. Ere I hither came, The avenger of such infamous misdeeds, Perhaps to no dubious test the gods would bring Courage in me, in thee fidelity. Py. Courage? thou hast too much. How many times For thee I've trembled! I am pledged, thou know'st, Every vicissitude to share with thee; But, oh reflect, that nothing yet is done Of what we have to do. We are arrived; No more. Amid the multifarious means To such a task, 'tis fitting now that we Inflexibly adhere to one alone, And that the best; and that we should resolve What pretext to select, with what feign'd name T'invent a reason for our coming hither; An adequate foundation we should lay For such an edifice. Ores. Eternal justice Will be our sure foundation. To myself That blood is due for which athirst I come. The surest means? Behold it in my sword! Py. Oh youthful turbulence! For blood thou thirstest? Others, defended by a thousand swords, Thirst also for thy blood. Ores. T'appal Ãgisthus, Already self-appall'd, my name suffices: Too potent is my name; and of what temper Can he a breast-plate or a shield possess, That I can pierce it not? Py. He has a shield, A tough, impenetrable, doughty shieldâ His innate baseness. Round his person throng Innumerable satellites; and he, Trembling, though safe, stands in the midst of them. Ores. To announce me, and disperse these satellites, Were the same thing. Py. To announce thee and be slain, Were the same thing; and slain by what a death! Even these satellites possess a faith And courage of their own: they from the tyrant Draw their subsistence; nor would have him dead, Except themselves destroy him. Ores. In my cause The people then ... Py. Dost hope that in the heart Of the base people, hatred or regard Can ever be perpetuated? Spoil'd, Degraded, now it sees one tyrant fall, And now another rise; not one it loves, And yields to all; forgets an Agamemnon, At an Ãgisthus trembles. Ores. 'Tis, alas! But too, too true! ... But thou dost not, like me, Before thine eyes behold a murder'd father, Bleeding and unavenged, who asks, expects, And threatens me to vengeance. Py. Hence am I More qualified that vengeance to obtain. Oh hear me. We to all are here unknown, And wear a stranger's garb: unquiet tyrants, Whether from inclination or from fear, Watch narrowly the movements of a stranger. Soon as the day-light dawns, and we've been seen, We shall be dragg'd into Ãgisthus' presence.â What shall we say? Ores. Strike: in the miscreant's breast A thousand wounds inflict; and hold our peace. Py. Camest thou for certain death, or certain vengeance? Ores. Provided both be certain; first to slay, And then be slain. Py. Orestes, by our friendship, And by thy murder'd father, I beseech thee A little while refrain: for a few hours Yield to my judgment, I will give the rest To thy revenge. Rather than with the sword, Baseness should be assail'd by artifice. Ãgisthus should believe us messengers Sent from my father; bearers to himself In Argos, of thy death. Ores. Belie my name To an Ãgisthus? I? Py. Thou may'st be silent; Thou need'st not lie, for I will speak for thee. The imposture will be mine, and mine alone. We shall perceive th'emotions of Ãgisthus At such intelligence, and shall discover Electra's destiny. Ores. Electra! ... Ah! ... Much do I fear that she no longer lives. Tidings of her I never have received. Ãgisthus certainly would never spare The blood of Agamemnon. Py. But the wife Of that Ãgisthus is Electra's mother. Perhaps she has saved her; and if it be so, Think that she still is in the tyrant's power; And that we might, only by naming her, Ensure her death. In a far different guise, Thou know'st that Strophius himself, with arms And troops, might re-establish thee in Argos; But open war, however prosperous, Would give thee nothing but thy throne and sceptre. Meanwhile the impious tyrant would escape, And of his rage (if he has not ere now Slain her) Electra would remain the victim; Thy sole beloved sister; she to whom Thou ow'st thy life. Thou see'st th'imperious need There is for caution. Lofty is thy purpose; A purpose mightier far than to regain A throne usurp'd: defeat it not, Orestes. Who knows? thy mother perhaps is penitent ... Ores. Ah! speak not thou to me of her. Py. Of her, Nor aught besides.âI only ask of thee To listen to my counsel. If thou wilt not, Those gods that by thy side have planted me, No longer will protect thee. Ores. I yield all, I swear to thee, except the deed of death. I will behold the murderer of my father; Behold him, nor unsheathe my thirsty sword.â Be this the earliest effort of my virtue, Oh father, which I consecrate to thee. Py. Silence; methinks I hear a stealing footstep ... Behold! a lady in a mourning garment Advances from the palace. For a while Let us withdraw ourselves. Ores. She comes this way. SCENE THE SECOND. Electra, Orestes, Pylades. Elec. For once, Ãgisthus a short time is absent; I now, without constraint, may bring my tributeâ What do I see! Two youths who, by their dress And by their mien, I do not recognise. They watch me, and seem strangers. Ores. Didst thou hear? Ãgisthus' name she mention'd. Py. Ah! be silent. Elec. Oh, youthful strangers, (for I deem ye such,) Say; to these walls what brings you? Py. Let me speak; Stand thou apart.âStrangers we are, 'tis true; Here we come bearers of important tidings. Elec. Are they intended for Ãgisthus? Py. Yes. Elec. What tidings can these be? ... Pursue your steps; Ãgisthus now is absent. In the palace Ye may repose yourselves till he return. Py. And his return? Elec. Before the day is spent; In a few hours, is certain. Thanks and honours He will bestow on you, as is your due, If grateful be the tidings. Py. They will be Grateful, though perhaps unlucky to Ãgisthus. Elec. How my heart beats!âUnlucky? Are they such That I may know their import? Py. Pardon me. Thou seem'st to me a lady of high birth; But that the king should hear these tidings first Appears to me incumbent ... By my words Thou seemest troubled? ... What? ... Can any news Brought from a distant country interest thee? Elec. Interest me! ... no ... But from what land are ye? Py. Grecians we are; from Crete we lately came. But in thee, more than from thy mourning garments, I, from thy looks, thy gestures, and thy words, Trace the impression of profound distress. May I enquire? ... Elec. What sayest thou? ... in me? Thou know'st that pity in a woman's heart Is easily excited. Mournful news, Although it have no reference to myself, Afflicts me. Hence, though I express'd a wish For you to speak it, spoken it would grieve me. Py. Oh gentle-hearted! would'st thou deem the wish To know thy name presumptuous? Elec. To know it Could not advantage you; and to my grief, (Since grief thou see'st in me,) to speak my name Would surely be no solace. It is true, That, far from Argos ... some solicitude ... Some fond anxiety perchance ... to me Might yet have reference. But, no! I clearly see that your arrival In no wise is connected with myself. Yet, when a stranger lands upon these shores, Involuntary feelings rush upon me; I feel my timid heart, 'twixt hope and fear, Fluctuate tumultuously. Yes, I'm convinced You ought not to reveal to me the purpose Of your arrival. Enter: I meanwhile Pursue my pilgrimage to yonder tomb. Ores. Tomb! what tomb? where? and whose? Elec. Dost thou not see? Yonder? Atrides' tomb. Ores. Oh sight of woe! Elec. And dost thou shudder at it? And have the tidings of the horrible death That he received in Argos reached your ears? Py. Where have they not been heard? Ores. Oh sacred tomb Of the king of kings, requirest thou a victim? Thou shalt have one. Elec. What is it that he says? Py. I heard him not. Elec. Did he not speak of victim? And why? Say, is the memory of Atrides Sacred to him? Py. Yes: but a little while His father he has lost; each mournful object Excites emotion in his pious heart; Strange fits of phrenzy seize him suddenly.â Compose thyself, Orestes. Art thou mad? How can I ever trust in thee? Elec. His eyes, Motionless, eager, terrible in aspect, He fixes on the tomb ... Oh thou, who art thou, Thus generously daring? ... Ores. Leave to me The transport of revenge. Py. He hears thee not. Pardon, oh lady, his frenetic ravings. Regard not what he says: he is insane.â Art thou determined then, at all events, Thus to betray thyself? Ores. Into the traitor, Time after time, my weapon will I plunge As many times, as from his horrid wound Thou shedded'st drops of blood. Elec. He's not insane. A father didst thou say ... Ores. A father, yes, Was torn from me. Oh rage! and he remains Yet unavenged. Elec. If thou art not Orestes, Who art thou, then? Py. What do I hear? Ores. Orestes? Who, who invokes me thus? Py. Now art thou lost. Elec. Electra calls thee thus. I am Electra, who, with both my arms, Thus press thee to my bosom. Ores. Where am I? What said I? ... Pylades, alas! ... Elec. Dispel, Orestes, Pylades, dispel all fear. I do not feign a name. Orestes, thee, From thy rapt ecstacy I recognised; And from my grief, my tears, and my affection, Acknowledge thou Electra. Ores. Thou dost live; Oh sister! thou dost live? and I embrace thee. Elec. Eventful day! Ores. And do I clasp thee thus? What inexpressible delight I feel! Yet oh, that bitter sight! my father's tomb. Elec. Be calm a while, I pray thee! Py. Oh, Electra, How have I sighed to know thee! It was thou That saved'st my Orestes, of myself The better part; think, if I do not love thee. Elec. And thou hast been his guardian friend: to me Thou art a second brother. Py. Ah! do thou Join then thy prayers with mine; ah, undertake With me to check the imprudent eagerness Of that impetuous spirit. To despair, Orestes, would'st thou drive us? Every instant Would'st thou that I fear for thee? Hitherto, Pity, love, vengeance, have conducted us In safety hither; but if thou art thus Unguarded ... Ores. Pardon me ... beloved Pylades; ... I was transported ... what is now thy wish? But oh! what reason e'er could be controul'd? ... What feelings, at a sight so unexpected! ... I saw him,âyes, I saw him with these eyes. His head he lifted from the sable tomb; His fleshless fingers from his face removed His grisly locks; coagulated blood And tears, upon those livid cheeks of death Stood glistening. Obvious to my sight alone He was not: for upon mine ears there fell A fearful and a melancholy voice, Whose tones yet vibrate in my inmost heart:â âImbecile son, why dost thou still delay? âThou art arrived at manhood; hast assumed âThy sword, and still thy father's murderer lives.â Oh fierce rebuke! ... He on thy tomb shall fall, Slain by my hands; his veins shall not retain A drop within them of his impious blood. Thou, thirsty shade, shalt quickly drink it all. Elec. Ah! calm thy rage. I also often see My father's squalid spectre stalk around That gelid tomb, and yet I hold my peace. At every step, within these palace walls, Thou wilt behold the impress of his blood, Yet thou, with dry eyes, wilt be forced to see them, Till, with fresh blood, they are by thee effaced. Ores. Electra, how much more than empty words Would deeds content my heart! But, till the day For action comes, my anguish I will smother. Meanwhile, since born to weep, let us at least Shed tears together. Shall it then be true What I no longer hoped for? In thy bosom Shall I shed tears of love, of grief, and anger? Tidings of thee I long had ceased to hear; I fear'd that thou had'st fall'n the tyrant's victim, And rather came prepared t'avenge thy death, Than thus to clasp thee to my breast. Elec. I live, And I embrace thee: this is the first day In which I have not quarrell'd with my life. The impious fury of the cruel tyrant, Stung e'en to madness that he could not slay thee, Convinced me thou wert living; but, alas! With how much apprehension did I hear That thou had'st left the hospitable home Of Strophius! Py. Purposely my father spread Such a report, that hereby, unassail'd By treacheries of Ãgisthus, he might live In greater safety. I, throughout this space, Ne'er left him, nor will ever leave him. Ores. Death Can alone part us. Py. No, not e'en death. Elec. Oh thou unparallel'd and faithful friend! But now inform me, how will you appear Before the cruel and suspicious tyrant? Here to conceal you were impossible. Py. We will present ourselves as messengers, Bringing the tidings of Orestes' death. Ores. The artifice is vile. Elec. Less vile than he, Whose cruelty compels you to deceive. There is none better or more sure; but use Discretion. When you are introduced to him, 'Twill be my care t'adjust for you the whole; The time, the place, the mode, the implements For his destruction. Yet I keep, Orestes, That sword I keep, which in her husband's breast She plunged, whom we no longer since have dared To call our mother. Ores. Tell me how she fares, That impious woman? What life does she lead? How does she force thee for the crime not thine To make atonement, that thou art her daughter? Elec. Thou canst not picture to thyself her life. All would, and ought to, pity it, except The children of Atrides ... and perchance E'en they will be constrain'd to feel compassion. By terror and suspicion always haunted; E'en by Ãgisthus treated with contempt: Loving Ãgisthus, though she knew him guilty; Repentant, yet perhaps capable once more Her trespass to commit, if the base flame, At which she is incensed, and blushes, willed it; Now wife, now mother; yet ne'er wife or mother. Remorseless thoughts, by thousands and by thousands, Distract her heart by day; and horrid phantoms Scare from her nightly pillow quiet sleep. Behold the life she leads. Ores. May heaven inflict, That which by nature we are forbidden to do, On her a terrible and lasting vengeance! But yet to-day she must decide to be Either a mother or a wife; she must, When at her side, transfix'd by me, she sees The vile adulterer weltering in his blood. Elec. Ah, wretched mother! yet thou hast not seen her; Who knows the impression that she may produce? Ores. My father I have heard; and that suffices. Elec. Yet such a mingled conflict in thy heart Wilt thou experience, that, against thy will, Thou wilt be forced to weep, and recollect She is thy mother. She is still towards me Indulgent; but the infamous Ãgisthus, Who only spares my life to her entreaties, Much as he can oppresses me. Yet I Have hitherto endured his cruel gift, The day expecting, when I might to thee Restore the sword stained with my father's blood. Although a woman, I have oft been tempted With my right hand to grasp it; but, at last, Orestes, thou art come, and come in time. To-day Ãgisthus, from himself to banish My importuning presence, had decreed My instant nuptials with an abject slave. Ores. I come unbidden to these impious nuptials, The gods shall have an unexpected victim. Elec. My mother, but in vain, opposed. Ores. On her, Say, might we aught depend? Elec. Ah! not at all. Although she fluctuates betwixt vice and virtue, To vice she still adheres. When at her side No more she sees Ãgisthus, ... then perchance ... Ah then, would be the moment to reclaim her. She weeps with me, 'tis true, but yet she lives With the usurper. Do thou shun her presence Till he return. Py. Where is the miscreant gone? Elec. Impious, he spends this day in revelling, The anniversary of our father's death. Ores. Oh rage! Elec. E'en now he's outraging the gods. Towards MycÃ¦ne, in a spot not far From hence, he offers to the king of hell Unhallow'd victims and nefarious vows: It cannot now be long ere he return. But let our conference cease; within the palace I will return unseen; t'await Ãgisthus Do you still linger in this outer court. I to thee, Pylades, commend my brother. To-day, Orestes, I shall ascertain Whether or not thou lovest me. I pray thee, By the remembrance of our murder'd father, And by that love, be guided by thy friend, And check th'impetuous ardour of thy nature; For that revenge, to which we now aspire, May be, by too much wishing it, defeated.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE THIRD. SCENE THE FIRST. Clytemnestra, Electra. Cly. Leave me, Electra; go to thy apartments: I wish to meet Ãgisthus ... Elec. Ah, my mother! Art thou already troubled by his absence? And fear'st thou, that the thunderbolts of heaven To ashes have consumed him, as he stood Before the altar? Lay aside such fear; Heaven hitherto, upon the impious here, Hath shed perpetual blessings. Cly. Of Ãgisthus Cease thus to speak. Elec. 'Tis true, his very name Blisters the tongue that dares to give it utterance. Oh! art thou she, that would'st erewhile with me Bring secretly an offering to that tomb Of tears and vows? Cly. Cease, cease; I must go hence. Elec. To meet the man, whom I have often heard, By thine own lips pronounced, the instrument Of all thy woes? Cly. 'Tis true: happy with him I never am; nor am I so without him. Leave me. Elec. At least ... permit me ... Cly. What would'st thou? Elec. Ah! should she meet her son before Ãgisthus? SCENE THE SECOND. Clytemnestra. Cly. I seek in vain to cheat my weary thoughts. SCENE THE THIRD. Clytemnestra, Orestes, Pylades apart. Ores. He never will arrive? Py. Where art thou going? Cly. I love Ãgisthus, too, too much! ... Ores. Ãgisthus? Who do I see? 'tis she: I recollect her. Py. Come here, Orestes; what art thou doing? stop. Cly. Who thus present themselves before my eyes? Ah! who art thou? Py. Pardon our hardihood; Strangers, perchance we have advanced too far; Ascribe it only to our ignorance. Cly. Who may you be? Ores. In Argos ... Py. We had not Our birth ... Ores. Nor from Ãgisthus ... Py. To the king The lord of Phocis sends us ... Ores. If there be A monarch here ... Py. From hence, if thou permit, We will advance within the palace gates, Seeking Ãgisthus. Cly. What cause brings you here? Ores. A lofty one. Py. And to the king would we Impart it. Cly. You may equally to me Impart it; from the palace now the king Is absent. Py. But he will return ... Ores. I hope. Cly. Meanwhile, to me the whole shall be declared. Ores. To thee will I declare it ... Py. Yes, if thou Insist upon it; but ... Cly. Upon the throne I sit beside Ãgisthus. Ores. All men know That thou art worthy of him. Py. The disclosure Would be to thee less grateful than to him. Cly. What may it be? Ores. Why should'st thou fancy this? What grateful tidings can the husband hear, Which to his wife were not so? Py. Thou dost know, That our unquestionable lord imposed To tell it only to Ãgisthus' ears. Ores. She and Ãgisthus in two bodies are One soul. Cly. And why thus keep me in suspense? Speak, speak, without delay. Py. The news to thee Would be too bitter; and may heaven forbid That weâ Ores. Thou art mistaken: we Bring her entire security and peace. Cly. It is your duty now to put an end ... Ores. Oh queen, we bring thee tidings of the death ... Cly. Of whom? ... Py. Peace, peace ... Cly. Of whom? speak. Ores. ... Of Orestes. Cly. Alas! what hear I? of my son? ... Oh heavens! Ores. Yes, of the son of Agamemnon slain. Cly. What say'st thou? Py. That Orestes was not slain, He tells thee. Ores. Of the son of him that was ... Py. Insane and perjured youth, dost thou to me Thus keep thy promise? Cly. Wretched that I am, Thus of my only son left destitute ... Ores. But, perhaps, Orestes Was not then the most deadly enemy Of thy Ãgisthus? Cly. Barbarous! Dost thou Thus to a mother of her only son The death announce? Py. Yet an unpractised youth, And ignorant of courts, (ah, pardon him,) Incautiously, with a superfluous zeal, He, to content thy wish, has mine betray'd. Such tidings thou should'st afterwards have heard, With management, imparted by Ãgisthus, And only from his lips; such was my project. But if, through zeal ... Ores. Perhaps I have err'd; but now Thy son is dead, securely with thy consort ... Cly. Be silent. Ere I was Ãgisthus' wife I was Orestes' mother. Ores. Perhaps Ãgisthus Is not so dear to thee as was Orestes. Py. Thou speakest foolishly! What art thou doing? Darest thou exacerbate a mother's pangs With importuning and officious words? Leave her, and come with me; time and her tears Alone can mitigate her grief ... Ores. Ãgisthus That grief will mitigate. Py. Come, let us cease T'intrude upon her sorrows; we have made Ourselves already too unwelcome to her. Cly. Since in my heart the wound ye have inflicted, Thou shalt exult in widening that wound, Hard-hearted youth! Ah, tell me now, where, when, And how my son expired. Beloved Orestes, All that relates to thee I fain would know; Nor hear of any thing beside thyself. Ores. Thou, then, yet lov'd'st him tenderly? Cly. Oh youth, Hast thou no mother? Ores. ... I? ... I had. Py. Oh heaven! Lady, thy son yielded to fate alone. His life ... Ores. Was not cut short by impious foes; No, to repeated and atrocious treason He did not fall a victim. Py. Be content With knowing this. Who could speak to a mother More circumstantially? Cly. But if a mother Insist on hearing more ... Py. Ah do thou suffer, That the sad story be alone by us Related fully to the king. Ores. Ãgisthus With joy will hear it. Py. We have said too much. Let us depart. Pity forbids us now T'obey thee.âFollow me. 'Tis fitting now, At length, that, to my will, thou should'st submit. SCENE THE FOURTH. Clytemnestra. Cly. Ah, my unhappy son! ... thou innocent son Of an abandon'd mother! ... Ah, Orestes! ... Thou art no more! From thy paternal realm Banish'd by me, thou diest? Sick, deserted, And by what death who knows? And at thy side, In thy last agonies, thou hadst no friend? ... No ritual honours did thy tomb receive ... A fugitive, unknown, and unassisted, Oh what a fate for great Atrides' son! ... No mother, and no sister, with their tears, Embalm'd thy livid corse! ... Beloved son, Thy mother's hands perform'd not the last office, Closed not thy dying eyes.âBut how I rave! Were these hands fit for such a function? Still Impure, and reeking with thy father's blood, Thou from thy face, Orestes, and with reason, Wouldest have thrust them back. O thou, deserving a less barbarous mother! ... But I, for having sacrificed thy father, Say, am I less thy mother? Never, never Are nature's rights annull'd. ... Yet had not fate In youth cut short thy life, thou would'st perchance, (As a vain oracle predicted once) Have turn'd thy sword against thy mother's breast? Thy duty this: What other hand so well Could punish my irreparable fault? Ah live, Orestes, live; return to Argos; Fulfil the oracle; in me, no mother, But a vile woman, who usurp'd the name, Wilt thou destroy: ah come ... but thou'rt no more. SCENE THE FIFTH. Ãgisthus, Clytemnestra. Ãgis. What groans are these? Say, what has happen'd? what new cause of grief? Cly. Yes, now exult, in tears, eternal tears, I have fresh cause of grief: ah, cease to stand In tremulous and mute astonishment. At last, for once thy wishes all are granted; That fierce, that terrible, that cruel foe, That foe who never injured thee, is slain. My only son, alas! no longer breathes. Ãgis. What dost thou say? Orestes? Is he dead? Whence hadst thou the intelligence? who brought it? Scarce can I think it true. Cly. Not think it true? No, no; improbable thou judgest it, Since he so often has escaped thy sword. But if thou'rt not persuaded by my tears, My fury may convince thee. Even now, All, all my unextinguish'd love returns To my maternal heart. Ãgis. Canst thou adduce No other proof? Cly. Proofs thou shalt have enough To satisfy that ravening heart of thine. Yes, word by word, Ãgisthus, thou shalt hear The dreadful story told; and at each word Thy soul will brighten with Thyestean joy. Strangers there are in Argos competent To satiate thy inhuman appetite. Ãgis. Have strangers ventured to appear in Argos Without my knowledge? Why was their arrival Not first to me divulged? Cly. Does it afflict thee That thou wert not the first within my breast To plunge the dagger? Such a pious deed Belong'd especially to thee: Ãgisthus Should to a wife and mother, and none else, Such grateful tidings bring. Ãgis. What thus excites, Lady, thy sudden anger? Didst thou love So fondly thy dead son, who, when alive, Thou scarcely recollectedst? Cly. What say'st thou? Never did I, no never, cease to be The mother of Orestes; and sometimes If I a mother's love conceal'd, to this Maternal love impell'd me. I suppress'd Much of the fondness that my heart conceived, Towards my son, only that he might be The less exposed to thy clandestine snares. Now that he is no more, no more I feign; Know that Orestes was, and ever will be, Much dearer than thyself ... Ãgis. Thou sayest little. Yet I was dearer to thee than thy fame. Cly. The fame of her who is espoused to thee Should not be spoken of. I gave to thee My fame, my husband, and my bosom's peace; And of my only and beloved son The all I gave to thee, except his life. But thou, impell'd by horrible revenge, And a corrupt ambition of the throne, Whate'er I gave to thee, did'st deem a nothing, While aught remain'd to take. Who ever saw A heart at once so cruel and so false? To thy nefarious, ill-feign'd tenderness, Which I believed in a disastrous hour, Tell me, ah tell me, was the child Orestes Ever an obstacle? Yet scarce the pulse Of dying Agamemnon ceased to beat, Ere thou didst openly, with threatening voice, Demand Orestes' life. Thou, franticly, Exploredst all the palace: then that sword, Which thou daredst never, with thy infirm arm, Plunge in the father, bravely thou didst brandish; Thou wert a hero 'gainst a powerless infant. He from thy fury was withdrawn: that day Fully I knew thee; but, alas! too late. Unhappy son! what did it then avail That from thy father's murderer thou wert rescued? A premature death in a foreign land Awaited thee ... Ah, thou hast kill'd my son, Usurper, parricide; his death is thine! Ah, pardon me, Ãgisthus ... pardon me ... I was a mother; ... and am now no longer ... Ãgis. Provided that Orestes be no more, Thou may'st indulge in tears and execrations. Tell me: to whom these messengers first spoke? Who are they? where did they first land? who sent them? Where lodge they? are they heralds from a king? Why, ere elsewhere their business they proclaim'd, Did they not ask in Argos for Ãgisthus? Cly. For thee they ask'd: from Strophius they come: Unlucky fortune threw them in my way: All I would hear in spite of their reluctance. Two, but unlike in character, the men Are in thy palace lodged. The one refused, Compassionate and cautious, to disclose To me the bitter tidings; but the other, Impetuous, fervid, and ferocious, seem'd To triumph in my grief: he no less joy Will feel in telling, than in hearing, thou, The melancholy tale. Ãgis. But, why to me Should Strophius now expressly send such news? He always was th'ally of Agamemnon: This all men know. Did not this very Strophius Shelter his son? Lastly, did he not give To him a refuge in his court? Cly. 'Tis true, He did at first; but now for many years He has from thence been absent: since that time Of him we heard no more. Ãgis. Fame spake of him; But who can know the truth? Yet 'tis most certain That from his earliest years he did possess, As an inseparable guide, and guard, Defender, friend, the son of Strophius, That Pylades of his whom I abhor. In short, towards me Strophius was always hostile: Whence has he changed? Cly. Dost thou not know, by proof, Now that thou art made a king, what constitutes A monarch's heart?âBarbarian, perhaps to thee 'Tis grateful thus t'hear me asseverate That which cost me so much? Go, thou hast heard Sufficient for thy purpose; go, and leave me.â Strophius conducive to his interests deem'd Orestes; hence withdrew him from thy power; Hence welcomed him, and loved him ... regally: Hence banish'd him, when useless he became, Or detrimental; hence he sends to thee A prompt ambassador t'announce his death. Thou in this fashion once thyself didst love me, Before I slew my husband, and bestow'd On thee his kingdom; so thou hatedst me, When I no more could serve thee; and so now Thou dost despise me. Thus are mutable In monarchs, virtue, honour, faith, and love, Changing with every tide of chance and fortune. Ãgis. Thou should'st remember that I left to thee The choice between Ãgisthus and Atrides: Thou madest the choice. Why then, by endless taunts, Constrain me to atone for thy own deed? As much as thou deservest it, I love thee. Cly. Ãgisthus, to my importuning taunts I put an end. Despise me if thou canst; But never dare to tell me that thou dost so. If to a crime accurs'd love drove me, think To what that love when scorn'd, remorse, revenge, And grief, may drive a woman in despair. SCENE THE SIXTH. Ãgisthus. Ãgis. Be women heard; they care not for the rest.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FOURTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Orestes, Pylades. Py. The crisis is arrived: we cannot now, E'en if we would, recede: thou know'st that we Are summon'd by Ãgisthus to his presence. To us, commanded here to wait for him, Forthwith he comes; and if thy manners change not, We also come here to be kill'd, not kill: I say no more. Be frantic as thou wilt; I am prepared for death, as well as vengeance. Ores. Alas! I know that I deserve too well Rebukes like these: thou lovest me too much: I was not worthy of a friend like thee: Ah pardon me. I will restrain myself Before Ãgisthus: that will be, I hope, Easier to me, than to restrain myself Before my mother, who appears to me To have her face, her robe, and both her hands Discolour'd still with blood. Yes, better far The hatred I can master, which I bear Towards a foe, than that commingled conflict Of pity and revenge, which at the sight Of such a mother throbb'd in every vein. Py. Who will'd thee to encounter such a conflict? Not I. Ores. An impulse undefinable; Yet stronger than myself. Would'st thou believe it? At first the thought rush'd irresistibly To slay her on the spot; in swift succession, And fierce as rapid, a new wish possess'd me To clasp her in my arms: and afterwards Both impulses in strange vicissitude Assail'd me e'en to madnessâfearful state, And inexpressible as it was fearful! ... Py. Peace, peace; Ãgisthus comes. Ores. What do I see? And with him also comes my mother. Py. Now Do thou be silent, or destroy me. SCENE THE SECOND. Ãgisthus, Clytemnestra, Orestes, Pylades, Soldiers. Ãgis. Come, Come, oh consort: thou may'st once more hear Tidings, which even yet I scarce believe. Cly. Barbarian, dost thou force me to this torture? Ãgis. Let us examine.âStrangers, then to me The King of Phocis hath deputed you As trusty messengers? Py. E'en so. Ãgis. Do ye Bring certain news? Py. My lord, a monarch sent us; We to a monarch speak: can there exist Suspicion of imposture? Ãgis. But your Strophius Till now ne'er gave me pledge of amity? Py. This then will be the first. I can't deny That he already many years ago Had different sentiments: he felt compassion For the unfriended fortunes of Orestes; But yet, if once he granted him a refuge, He always strenuously to him denied Arms and assistance; and against thyself Strophius would ne'er wage war. Ãgis. Perhaps openly He dared not wage it. But of this enough. Where did he perish? Ores. He! Py. The Cretan soil Gives him a tomb. Ãgis. And how, or ere to me, Was his death known to Strophius? Py. Pylades The news bore quickly to his father: he Was present at the sad catastrophe. Ãgis. To him a destiny so premature What there occasion'd? Py. His too youthful ardour. Every fifth year, in Crete, by ancient usage, Renews commemorative games and rites Of festal sacrifice to highest Jove. Desire of fame, and natural love of pleasure, Drew to that shore Orestes: by his side His Pylades inseparably stood. A warm desire for honour prompted him, On a light car, within the wide arena, To seek the noble palm, for rapid coursers: Too much intent on victory, there he lost, By gaining it, his life. Ãgis. But how? Relate. Py. Too fierce, impatient, and impetuous, Now with a menacing cry he press'd them forward, Now with a whip, which, stain'd with blood, he whirl'd, So furiously he lash'd his ill-train'd steeds, (Which, in proportion as they were more swift, Became more mettlesome,) that past the goal They flew. Chafed by the reins, and deaf to all his cries, With which he vainly sought to quiet them, Their nostrils fire emit; and to the air Waved in wild masses their luxuriant manes; In a thick cloud of dust involved, and vast As is the circus, swift as is the lightning, Through all that amplitude, with all that swiftness, Backwards and forwards, up and down they flew, âEccentric now, and now orbicular.â The tortuous whirlings of the chariot bring Discomfiture, fear, death, on every side; Until the fervid axle being driven With terrible force against a marble column, Orestes fell o'erthrown. Cly. Ah! say no more: A mother hears thy words. Py. Ah! pardon me. I will not tell thee how, dragg'd by the reins, He stain'd the ground with blood ... His friend, in vain, ... Ran to his aid ... Orestes in his arms Breathed the last sigh. Cly. Oh luckless death! ... Py. All wept for him in Crete; such was his grace, His beauty, and his courage ... Cly. Tears, alas! Who would not shed for him, except alone This infamous usurper? ... Much-loved son, No more must I behold thee; never more? But ah! too plainly do I see thee pass The waves of Styx, and clasp thy father's shade; Too plainly see you both direct towards me Th'indignant look, and burn with horrid rage ... Yes, honour'd shades, 'tis I, and I alone, That am your murderer ... Inhuman mother! Consort most guilty!âNow, Ãgisthus, now, Art thou not satisfied? Ãgis. Thy narrative Has certainly the character of truth; That truth will soon be ascertain'd. Meanwhile Remain within my palace; a reward, Such as is fitting, ere ye hence depart, Ye shall receive. Py. Yes; we will here remain At thy command.âCome, come. Ores. Let us depart, Let us depart; for now I can no more Refrain from speech. Cly. Oh thou, who dost relate The sad event, and not exult with joy, Ah stay awhile thy footsteps, and inform me, Why thou hast not to his sad mother brought The sacred dust of her beloved son In a funereal urn? A tragical, Yet welcome gift! to which I have a claim Before all others. Py. Pylades perform'd His obsequies; from the funereal rites Excluding every one, himself alone His dust collected, and with tears embalm'd it. This sad, and last commemorative pledge, Of the most noble, true, and holy friendship The world e'er saw, he for himself reserves: And who would seek to rob him of his treasure? Ãgis. Who would e'en seek to ask him for his treasure? Let him possess it: yet a friend so matchless Claim'd a more signal token of regard. I am astonish'd, that, with the defunct, To prove the entire devotion of his soul, He did not burn himself upon the pyre; And that one tomb did not contain the relics Of so sublime, unparagon'd a pair. Ores. And must I yet be silent? Py. It is true, The grief of Pylades caused not his death; Perchance, his pious fondness for his father Induced him, though reluctantly, to live. Sometimes the test of courage it becomes Rather to live than die. Ãgis. Does Pylades Detest me then, as much as did Orestes? Py. We are his father's messengers: he wishes With Argos to renew a strict alliance. Ãgis. But he's the sire of Pylades: 'twas he That, as he were his son, received Orestes; Defended him, from my revenge withdrew him. Py. But since he's dead, is not thy rage diminish'd? Cly. What was Orestes' crime? Ores. That he was son Of Agamemnon. Ãgis. How darest thou thus? ... Py. My lord, ... where doth not fame spread deeds like these? How much Atrides held thee in abhorrence, All Greece knows well; and that against thy life Snares he contrived; that thou wert thence constrain'd To watch Orestes ... Ores. That thou hast endeavour'd, A thousand and a thousand times, t'ensnare him To an opprobrious death, all Greece well knows; It also knows, that merely at his presence Thou would'st have trembled ... Ãgis. What is this thou sayest? Who art thou? Speak. Ores. I am ... Py. He is ... alas! Ãgisthus, check thy rage ... he is ... Ãgis. Who is he? Ores. I am ... Py. The son of Strophius ... Pylades. Nought hath induced him thus to come to Argos, But a desire to contemplate the spot That gave Orestes' birth. He hither comes To weep with his friend's mother. To my care Strophius committed him: to cause in thee The less suspicion, in a humble bark He came, laying aside all royal pomp. He, when he heard Orestes' name pronounced, Could not be silent: thus I've told thee all. Do not thou deem him criminal, oh king, From inconsiderate words; do not suspect That aught, but what I've told thee, brought him hither. Cly. Oh heaven! And is this Pylades? Oh come, My second son, ... and let me hear from thee ... Ãgis. Thy fond protection, queen, avails him not. Whoe'er he be, I am not bound t'endure Such haughty words ... But what! thy ardent look, Inflamed with vengeance, thou dost fix on me? And why dost thou irresolutely bend Thine eyes upon the ground? To me ye were not By Strophius sent as messengers; ah no; Ye lie, and ye are traitors.âGuards, in chains Bind them this instant. Pyl. Hear me, I beseech thee. And canst thou, from a vague suspicion, thus The rights of hospitality defy? Ãgis. Suspicion? fraud is graven in thy face And apprehension. Ores. In thy guilty heart They are engraved. Cly. Ah! tell me: perhaps the news May not be true? Py. Too true, alas! Ores. Already Tremblest thou lest Orestes should revive, Unrivall'd mother? Ãgis. What audacity! Some dreadful mystery is conceal'd beneath These words of thine. Ere thou receivest for them The punishment thou meritest ... Py. Oh heaven! Ah hear me. Ãgis. I will know the truth. Meanwhile Bind them with fetters in a horrid dungeon. Ah! there can be no doubt; these impious miscreants Are creatures of Orestes.âGuards, for them Prepare the bitterest torments: I myself Will strictly question them, and from their lips Learn their designs. In short, I will discover Whether Orestes be alive or dead. SCENE THE THIRD. Electra, Clytemnestra, Ãgisthus. Elec. Orestes dragg'd to death? What do I see? Oh mother, suffer'st thou thy only son Thus to be haled to punishment? Cly. My son? Ãgis. Orestes? In my power? In Argos? yonder? Orestes? Unexpected joy!âWhat ho! ... Cly. My son! Elec. Alas! what have I said? Ãgis. Oh run; Bring back these youths directly to my presence: Make haste; fly, fly: oh joy! Elec. And I've betray'd him? Cly. My son! If first thou do not murder me, Fear, monster, fear ... Ãgis. In Argos, in my palace, Perfidious lady, dost thou introduce, And thus conceal, my mortal enemy? Elec. They were unknown to her, as well as thee: Mine was the stratagem. Ãgis. And my revenge Shall fall on both. Cly. No; take my life alone; But spare my children ... Ãgis. Th'infamous remains Of Agamemnon? From excess of joy Scarce can my breast contain my swelling heart. One blow to-day exterminates them all ... But see, the traitors hitherward advance. Oh most propitious day! SCENE THE FOURTH. Orestes and Pylades chained; Ãgisthus, Clytemnestra, Electra, Soldiers. Ãgis. All, all I know, Excepting which of you may be Orestes: Confess ... Py. I am. Ores. 'Tis false: I am Orestes. Cly. Which of you is my son? This instant speak: I am to him a shield. Ãgis. Speak thou, Electra; And take heed not to lie; which is thy brother? Elec. 'Tis he; Running towards Pylades. 'tis he, too certainly. Py. I am ... Ores. Believe him not. Py. Since the projected plot Is thus discover'd, let none clothe himself With my avenging fury! Ores. If thou dare, Look on my eyes, Ãgisthus, and behold The fury that burns there; look, and confess, I am no other than Atrides' son. Believe this from the terror that my voice, My voice alone, strikes on thy coward heart. Ãgis. Coward thou art; coward, and traitor too; And by my hands shalt die. Cly. Or sheathe thy sword, Or plunge it in my breast: except through me, Tyrant, thou canst not touch them. Stop ... Oh heaven! ... Do thou to me reveal thyself, Orestes. Ah yes; thou, thou art he. Ores. Go, and elsewhere Stretch thy ensanguined hands; if we are doom'd To yield our lives, each of us is Orestes: If to embrace a mother like thyself, Neither of us thy son. Cly. Oh bitter words! ... Yet ... thee I cannot leave. Ãgis. See what reward Awaits thy insane love.âOrestes, yes, I know thee by thy filial piety. Of thee, and of thy execrable race, Thy words are worthy. Py. Can he silently, Who is not born from her, endure to hear A parricidal mother call him son? Ores. Peace, peace ... Elec. Ãgisthus, art thou not convinced, That this is Pylades; and that he lies To save his friend? ... Ãgis. To save his friend? And which Of you, which shall be saved? Ores. Ah! if my hands Were not with fetters bound, by certain proof Thou hadst now seen whether I am Orestes. But since I cannot with those hands tear out Thy miscreant heart, let this attesting sword Persuade thee who I am. Py. Rash e'en to madness! Put up that sword. Ores. Ãgisthus, contemplate This sword that I conceal'd for thy destruction. Lady, thou know'st this sword? Thy impious hand Planted this weapon in my father's breast. Cly. That is Atrides' voice, his looks, and gestures. Ah thou art he. If thou wilt not permit That I embrace thee, in my bosom plunge That weapon thou; thus in me for thy father Thou wilt obtain a more consummate vengeance. While I exist there is no violence That ever from thy side can sever me. Oh son! ... I am a mother yet: I love thee ... Ah! come to my embrace ... Ores. My sword to thee, Whom I will call my mother, I resign. Behold it, take it: thou know'st how to use it; Plunge it, ah plunge it in Ãgisthus' heart. Leave me to die; I shall die satisfied, If to my father I secure revenge. No other proof of thy maternal love Would I from thee receive: kill him this instant. Ah! what is this? Thou tremblest!âthou art pale! Thou weepest!âfrom thy hand the weapon falls! Lov'st thou Ãgisthus? Lov'st him, and art thou The mother of Orestes? Cursed sight! Let me no more behold thee: go. Cly. Alas! ... I die! ... Ãgis. This is, Taking up the sword, which had fallen at the feet of Clytemnestra. this is (and it belongs To me alone) the sword that slew the father; And it shall slay the son. I know it well; 'Twas mine of yore when stain'd with other blood; And to herself I formerly consign'd it. But perhaps, oh youthful hero, thou art not, Of all the achievements, perfectly apprized Of this redoubted blade. Thy impious grandsire, Atreus, first bathed it in my brothers' blood, Sons of Thyestes, of his brother. I Nought else of my paternal heritage Received: in this were all my hopes reposed; And not in vain reposed. Whate'er remains Of the abominable race, all, all, I hold within my power. I knew thee well From the desire I felt to murder thee. But ah! can death, e'en in its direst forms, With that unnatural banquet be compared To which thy cruel grandsire bade my father? Cly. Death to my son!âthou shalt have death the first. Ãgis. To me thou'rt known; thou also for thyself Tremble, oh lady, if now ... From my side Attempt not to depart. Cly. In vain ... Ãgis. Ah tremble. Elec. Appease thy thirst, Ãgisthus, in my blood: I also am the offspring of Atrides. Behold me at thy feet ... Ores. What dost thou, sister? Py. Mine was the stratagem; like them I had not A father to avenge; and yet I came, Yet thee I came to kill: thy cruelty In me thou may'st securely satiate. But without risk thou canst not shed in Argos The life-blood of Orestes. Ãgis. Pylades, Electra, and Orestes, all shall die; And thou too, lady, if thou do not calm Thy rage. Ores. Me, only me. What canst thou gain By sentencing to death a helpless virgin? Son of a powerful king is Pylades: And from his death great evil may result To thee: kill me, and me alone.âOh ye, The best part of myself, my friends, I feel For you indeed my soul alive to grief: My rash impetuosity hath slain you. Oh heaven! nought else afflicts me. But to see And hear Ãgisthus, and restrain myself, Was for a soul like mine impossible ... So much ye have done to save me, and I kill you. Ãgis. Oh joy! a greater punishment than death Can I then give thee? Slain before thine eyes Electra first, then Pylades shall fall; He then fall on them. Cly. Infamous ... Elec. Oh mother, Thus dost thou let him slaughter us? Py. Orestes! Ores. Oh heaven!. ... I weep! Ah yes; I weep for you. Thou, lady, once so bold in guilt, art thou In reparation so infirm? Cly. Oh son! Oh were it possible to free myself From his compulsive hands. Ãgis. Perfidious woman! Thou shalt not so escape from my controul. I now am weary of this waste of words: Cease, cease to speak. Why should we more delay To drag them to their death? Go.âRecollect, Dimas, thy life is of their death the pledge. SCENE THE FIFTH. Ãgisthus, Clytemnestra. Ãgis. Come with me, lady.âFinally, Thyestes, We do obtain a full, though tardy vengeance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT THE FIFTH. SCENE THE FIRST. Ãgisthus, Soldiers. Ãgis. Oh unexpected and disastrous treason! Orestes freed! We now shall see. SCENE THE SECOND. Clytemnestra, Ãgisthus. Cly. Alas! Return: fly back with speed. Ãgis. Ah, impious woman! Dost thou too rush to arms? Cly. I would preserve thee: Ah! hear me: I no longer am ... Ãgis. Perfidious ... Cly. Stop. Ãgis. Didst thou promise to surrender me To that vile traitor living? Cly. Nay, I swear From him to rescue thee, although I perish. Ah, remain here; conceal thyself awhile; Meanwhile I am thy rampart 'gainst his rage. Ãgis. Arms 'gainst that rage will be a better rampart. Go; leave me. I haste thither ... Cly. Where? Ãgis. To kill him. Cly. Thou goest to certain death. What art thou doing? Dost thou not hear the cries and menaces Of all the people? No, I cannot leave thee. Ãgis. In vain thou wishest from thy impious son To ward the death-blow. Quit my side; be silent; Leave me, or I ... Cly. Do thou, Ãgisthus; yes, Destroy me, if thou canst not trust to me. âOrestes!â Hear'st thou? How they shout, âOrestes!â How all around us that terrific name Sounds like a blast of death! Ah! I am now No more a mother! If thou art in danger, 'Gainst my own blood my heart once more is hardened. Ãgis. Thou know'st thy sight is hateful to the Argives: And if thou now wouldst shew thyself to them, Their rage thou wouldst redouble. But the shout Increases. Ah! thou wert the cause of this, Perfidious! vengeance I delay'd for thee, Which now reverts on me. Cly. Ah! kill me then. Ãgis. I will find safety by some other means. Cly. I follow thee. Ãgis. Ill wilt thou be my shield. Leave me, depart; whatever be the event, Thy presence importunes me. Hence, away. SCENE THE THIRD. Clytemnestra. Cly. All, all renounce me!âAgonizing state! My son no longer owns me for his mother; Nor, for his wife, my husband: yet I am A mother and a wife. Ah, wretched creature: I will at distance follow him, nor lose The traces of his steps. SCENE THE FOURTH. Electra, Clytemnestra. Elec. Where go'st thou, mother? Within the palace walls do thou return. Danger most imminent ... Cly. Where is Orestes? What is he doing? Tell me. Elec. Pylades, Orestes and myself are all in safety. Ãgisthus' satellites themselves were moved. âThis is Orestes,â Dimas first exclaim'd; Thence all the people: âLet Orestes live, âAnd let Ãgisthus die!â Cly. What do I hear? Elec. Mother, be calm; thou quickly wilt behold Thy son once more; and with the tyrant's spoils ... Cly. Ah cruel! Leave me; hence I fly ... Elec. No, no; Remain: the people shudder, and proclaim Thee, with loud voice, a parricidal wife. Be not at present visible; avoid The great and instant peril that awaits thee: On this account I came. In seeing us Dragged on to death, in thee a mother's grief, All, all was evident: now thou hast made Atonement for thy fault. To thee my brother Dispatch'd me urgently, to assist, to sooth thee, And to withdraw thee from the atrocious sight. Himself and Pylades, in arms, meanwhile, In every quarter swiftly run to seek Ãgisthus. Where is he? ... The miscreant ... Where? ... Cly. The miscreant is Orestes. Elec. What say'st thou? Oh heaven! What do I hear? Cly. I run to save him; Or with him to expire. Elec. Thou shalt not go. Mother, the people threaten ... Cly. Punishment To me is due, and I will brave it. Elec. Stop. The wretch that erewhile dragg'd to death thy children, Oh, mother, canst thou? ... Cly. Yes, myself will save him. Check not my footsteps: I am overruled By my accursed fate. He is my husband; Too much I've lost for him: I will not lose him, Nor can I lose him. Traitors, not my children, You I abhor. I will go to him. Leave me, Thou wretch! At all risks will I go to him: Ah! may I only there arrive in time. SCENE THE FIFTH. Electra. Elec. Go, if thou wilt then, to thy destiny ... Ah! yet I hope that she may be too late. Why cannot I my right hand with a sword Arm also, with a thousand blows to pierce The bosom of the infamous Ãgisthus! Oh blinded mother! how art thou possest By that unworthy wretch! But, yet ... I tremble ... Lest now the indignant people should on her Take vengeance for their king! ... Let me pursue her. But who comes hither? Pylades! and with him My brother is not? SCENE THE SIXTH. Pylades, Electra. Elec. Tell me: ah! ... Orestes? ... Py. The palace he surrounds with arms: our prey Is now secure. Where is Ãgisthus hidden? Hast thou seen him? Elec. I saw, and I restrain'd In vain his frantic consort: through yon door She darted; saying that herself would be Ãgisthus shield. He thence was gone before From forth the palace. Py. May he then have dared To shew himself to the Argives? At this hour He is no more: happy who smote him first!â But hark! more near and louder do I hear The people's cries. Elec. âOrestes!â Ah! I hope ... Py. Behold, he comes in all his burning fury. SCENE THE SEVENTH. Orestes, Pylades, Electra, Followers of Orestes and Pylades. Ores. Let none of you now venture in my cause To slay Ãgisthus: I, and I alone Possess the weapon destined to that deed.â Ãgisthus, where art thou, thou recreant coward? Ãgisthus, where art thou? A voice of death Calls thee; where art thou? ... Dost thou not come forth? Ah vile! dost hide thyself? In vain; to thee Not e'en the centre of deep Erebus Shall be a refuge. Thou shalt quickly see That I am truly Agamemnon's son. Elec. ... He ... is not here. Ores. Traitors! ye, ye perchance Have slain him without me! Py. Or ere I came He from the palace fled. Ores. He hides himself Within the palace: I will hale him thence.â Here shall my hand by thy soft tresses drag thee: There are no prayers, or powers of heaven or hell That can from me release thee. I will make thee With thy abhorred carcass plough the dust E'en to my father's tomb. There will I drag thee, And from thy veins, e'en to the latest drop, Drain thy adulterous life-blood. Elec. Dost thou not Believe me, brother? not believe Electra? Ores. And who art thou? I sought Ãgisthus here. Py. He flies. Ores. He flies! and ye, vile, here ye stand. Soon will I find him. SCENE THE EIGHTH. Clytemnestra, Electra, Pylades, Orestes, Followers of Orestes and Pylades. Cly. Son, have pity. Ores. Pity! Whose son am I? I am Atrides' son. Cly. Ãgisthus is already bound with fetters. Ores. Does he yet breathe? Oh joy! I go to slay him. Cly. Oh pause! 'Twas only I that kill'd thy father; Rather kill me ... Ãgisthus of that crime Was never guilty. Ores. Who, who clasps my arm? Who would detain me thus? Oh rage! Ãgisthus ... I see him: hither dragg'd he comes ... unloose me. Cly. Orestes, know'st thou not thy mother? Ores. Die, Ãgisthus!âmiscreant, perish!âby the hand Now of Orestes die! SCENE THE NINTH. Clytemnestra, Electra, Pylades, Followers of Pylades. Cly. Ah, see he flies! ... Thou shalt destroy me first. SCENE THE TENTH. Electra, Pylades, Followers of Pylades. Elec. Run, Pylades; Fly, bring her back; constrain her to return. SCENE THE ELEVENTH. Electra. Elec. Alas! I tremble ... She is still my mother: I ought to pity her.âBut did not she Behold her children erewhile on the brink Of an opprobrious death, and did she shew, In their behalf, the courage and the grief That now she feels for him?âAt length the day, The wish'd-for day, is come. At length, oh tyrant! Thou fall'st a bloody victim.âOnce again I hear the palace walls rebound with screams, As on that horrible ensanguined night, In which my father lay a murdered corse, I heard it some time echo.âEven now Orestes' hand hath dealt the mortal blow; Ãgisthus falls; the people's loud acclaim His death announces. Lo! Orestes comes Triumphant: and his right-hand grasps a sword Reeking with blood. SCENE THE TWELFTH. Electra, Orestes. Elec. Oh come, my brother, come, Noble avenger of the king of kings; Avenger of my father, and of Argos; Come to my breast ... Ores. Sister, ... behold me now The worthy son of Agamemnon. See, This is Ãgisthus' blood. Scarce I beheld him, Ere I sprang forward to destroy him there; Nor did I recollect that I had threaten'd To drag his body to my father's tomb. Within that trembling and effeminate heart I plunged and replunged full seven times my sword: Yet have I not appeased my ardent thirst. Elec. Did Clytemnestra then to arrest thy arm Not come in time? Ores. Who could accomplish that? Arrest my arm! I leap'd upon Ãgisthus; The lightening is not swifter in its course. The coward wept; those abject tears of his Fill'd me with greater rage. My father! ah, A man that dared not die could murder thee! Elec. My father is avenged; now calm thy spirits; And tell me, as thou hither cam'st, didst thou Not meet with Pylades? Ores. I saw Ãgisthus, Nought else.âWhere is beloved Pylades? How came it that he did not second me In such an enterprise? Elec. To him, erewhile, My mad, despairing mother I confided. Ores. Of them I nothing saw. Elec. See, he returns ... Oh Heaven! what see I? He returns alone? Ores. And sad? SCENE THE THIRTEENTH. Orestes, Pylades, Electra. Ores. Oh wherefore sad, my better part, Art thou? Dost thou not know that I have kill'd, I, that usurper? See; my weapon still Is reeking with his blood. Ah! thou with me The triumph hast not shared! Do thou then feast Thine eyes upon this spectacle. Py. Oh sight!â Orestes, give to me that sword. Ores. For what? Py. Give it to me. Ores. Then take it. Py. Hear me.âNow It is no longer lawful in this land For us to tarry: come ... Ores. But what? ... Elec. Ah! speak: Say where is Clytemnestra? Ores. Name her not: Perchance she now constructs the funeral pile For her flagitious husband. Py. More, far more, Thou hast consummated than thy revenge: Now come; ask nothing further ... Ores. Oh! what say'st thou ... Elec. My mother I reclaim of thee, oh Pylades. Ah! through my veins what death-like chillness shoots! ... Py. The gods! Elec. Ah! dead perchance? ... Ores. Against herself Infuriate has she turn'd her sword? Elec. Alas! ... Oh Pylades! ... thou answerest not? Ores. Relate; What has befallen her? Py. Transfix'd ... Ores. By whom? Py. Ah! come ... Elec. Thou killed'st her. Ores. I, parricide? Py. The sword thou unawares in her didst plunge, Blinded by rage, rushing to assault Ãgisthus. Ores. What sudden horror seizes me! ... Am I A parricide? ... That sword, oh Pylades, Give me: once more ... Py. It shall not be. Elec. My brother ... Py. Wretched Orestes! Ores. Who now calls me brother? Thou, impious woman, perhaps, who hast to life Preserved me, and the murder of my mother? Restore my sword; my sword, I say ... oh rage! What have I done? Where am I? Who constrains me? ... Who thus pursues me? ... Whither shall I fly? Where shall I hide myself?âOh father, father, Take from me that stern eye; quite through and through It pierces me ... Of me thou asked'st blood: Here, here is blood; for thee alone I shed it. Elec. Orestes, dear Orestes ... wretched brother ... No more he hears my voice; his sense is gone ... Thou, Pylades, and I, will ne'er forsake him. Py. Oh horrid and inevitable law, That when we would avenge, perpetuates guilt! END OF THE FIRST VOLUME.</field>
