      <field name="fulltext">Praefatio Baleus Prolocutor [Enter Baleus Prolocutor.] If profyght maye growe, most Christen audyence, By knowlege of thynges whych are but transytorye And here for a tyme, of moch more congruence Advauntage myght sprynge by the serche of causes heavenlye, As those matters are that the Gospell specyfye, Without whose knowledge no man to the truthe can fall, Nor ever atteyne to the lyfe perpetuall. For he that knoweth not the lyvynge God eternall, The father, the sonne, and also the holye Ghost, And what Christ suffered for redempcyon of us all, What he commaunded and taught in every coost, And what he forbode, that man must nedes be lost And cleane secluded from the faythfull chosen sorte In the heavens abo[v]e, to hys most hygh dysconforte. Yow therfor, good fryndes, I lovyngely exhorte To waye soche matters as wyll be uttered here, Of whome ye maye loke to have no tryfelinge sporte In fantasyes fayned, nor soche lyke gaudysh gere; But the thynges that shall your inwarde stomake stere To rejoyce in God for your justyfycacyon, And alone in Christ to hope for your salvacyon. Yea, first ye shall have the eternall generacyon Of Christ, lyke as Johan in hys first chaptre wryght; And consequentlye of man the first creacyon The abuse and fall through hys first oversyght; And the rayse agayne through Gods hygh grace and myght, By promyses first whych shall be declared all, Then by hys owne sonne the worker pryncypall. After that Adam bywayleth here hys fall, God wyll shewe mercye to every generacyon, And to hys kyngedome of hys great goodnesse call Hys elected spouse or faythfull congregacyon, As here shall apere by open protestacyon, Whych from Christes birthe shall to hys deathe conclude: They come that therof wyll shewe the certytude.

      <field name="fulltext">A TRAGEDYE OR ENTERLUDE MANYFESTYNG THE CHEFE PROMYSES OF GOD UNTO MAN BY ALL AGES IN THE OLDE LAWE, FROM THE FALL OF ADAM TO THE INCARNACYON OF THE LORDE JESUS CHRIST. Compyled by Johan Bale, Anno Domini 1538. [Incipit Actus Primus] [Enter Pater Coelestis and Adam.] Pater Coelestis In the begynnynge, before the heavens were create, In me and of me was my sonne sempyternall, With the holy Ghost, in one degre or estate Of hygh Godhed, to me, the father, coequall. And thys my sonne was with me one God essencyall Without separacyon at any tyme from me, And a God he is of equall dignyte. Sens the begynnynge my sonne hath ever be With me hys father in one essencyall beynge. All thynges were create by hym in yche degre, Both in heaven and earthe, and have their dyverse workynge; And without hys power was never made anye thynge That ever was wrought but through hys ordynaunce. Yche one have hys strength and whole contynuaunce. In hym is the lyfe and the just recoveraunce For Adam and hys, whych nought but deathe deserved; And thys lyfe to men is an hygh perseveraunce Or a lyght of faythe wherby they shall be saved. And thys lyght shall shyne amonge the people darkened With unfaythfulnesse, yet shall they not with hym take, But of wyllfull hart hys lyberall grace forsake. Whych wyll compell me agaynst man for to make In my dyspleasure and sende plages of coreccyon Most grevouse and sharpe hys wanton lustes to slake: By water and fyre, by syckenesse and infeccyon Of pestylent sores molestynge hys compleccyon, By troublouse warre, by derthe and peynefull scarsenesse, And after thys lyfe, by an extreme heavynesse. I wyll first begynne with Adam for hys lewdenesse, Whych for an apple neglected my commaundement, He shall contynue in laboure for hys rashenesse; Hys onlye sweate shall provyde hys food and rayment. Yea, yet must he have a greatter ponnyshment; Most terryble deathe shall brynge hym to hys ende, To teache hym how he hys lorde God shall offende. Hic praeceps in terram cadit Adamus, ac post quartum versum denuo resurgit. Adam Primus Homo Mercyfull father, thy pytiefull grace extende To me, carefull wretche, whych have me sore abused Thy precept breakynge. O lorde, I mynde to amende If thy great goodnesse wolde now have me excused. Most heavenlye maker, lete me not be refused, Nor cast from thy syght for one pore synnefull cryme. Alas, I am frayle: my whole kynde ys but slyme. Pater Coelestis I wott it is so, yet art thu no lesse faultye Than thu haddyst bene made of matter moch more worthye. I gave the reason and wytte to understande The good from the evyll, and not to take on hande Of a braynelesse mynde the thynge whych I forbad the. Adam Primus Homo Soch heavye fortune hath chefelye chaunced me For that I was left to myne owne lyberte. Pater Coelestis Then thu art blamelesse, and the faulte thu layest to me? Adam Primus Homo Naye, all I ascribe to my owne imbecyllyte, No faulte in the lorde but in my infirmyte, And want of respect in soche gyftes as thu gavest me. Pater Coelestis For that I put the at thyne owne lyberte; Thu oughtest my goodnesse to have in more regarde. Adam Primus Homo Avoyde it I can not, thu layest it to me so harde. Lorde, now I perceyve what power is in man, And strength of hymselfe whan thy swete grace is absent; He must nedes but fall, do he the best he can, And daunger hymselfe as apereth evydent. For I synned not so longe as thu wert present, But whan thu wert gone I fell to synne by and by And the dyspleased. Good lorde, I axe the mercy. Pater Coelestis Thu shalt dye for it with all thy posteryte. Adam Primus Homo For one faulte good lorde avenge not thyselfe on me, Whych am but a worme, or a fleshelye vanyte. Pater Coelestis I saye thu shalt dye with thy whole posteryte. Adam Primus Homo Yet mercy, swete lorde, yf anye mercy maye be. Pater Coelestis I am immutable; I maye change no decre. Thu shalt dye, I saye, without anye remedye. Adam Primus Homo Yet, gracyouse father, extende to me thy mercye And throwe not awaye the worke whych thu hast create To thyne owne imageâ but avert from me thy hate. Pater Coelestis But art thu sorye from bottom of thy hart? Adam Primus Homo Thy dyspleasure is to me most heavye smart. Pater Coelestis Than wyll I tell the what thu shalt stycke unto Lyfe to recover and my good faver also. Adam Primus Homo Tell it me, swete lorde, that I maye therafter go. Pater Coelestis Thys ys my covenaunt to the and all thy ofsprynge: For that thu hast bene deceyved by the serpe[n]t, I wyll put hatred betwixt hym for hys doynge And the woman kynde: they shall herafter dyssent. Hys sede with her sede shall never have agrement; Her sede shall presse downe hys heade unto the grounde, Slee hys suggestyons and hys whole power confounde. Cleave to thys promyse with all thy inwarde powre; Fyrmelye enlose it in thy remembraunce fast; Folde it in thy faythe with full hope daye and houre, And thy salvacyon it wyll be at the last. That sede shall clere the of all thy wyckednesse past And procure thy peace with most hygh grace in my syght: Se thu trust to it, and holde not the matter lyght. Adam Primus Homo Swete lorde, the promyse that thy self here hath made me, Of thy mere goodnesse and not of my deservynge, In my faythe I trust shall so establyshed be By helpe of thy grace, that it shall be remaynynge So longe as I shall have here contynuynge; And shewe it I wyll to my posteryte That they in lyke case have therby felycyte. Pater Coelestis For a closynge up take yet one sentence with the. Adam Primus Homo At thy pleasure lorde all thynges myght ever be. Pater Coelestis For that my promyse maye have the deper effect In the faythe of the and all thy generacyon Take thys sygne with it as a seale therto connect: âCrepe shall the Serpent for hys abhomynacyon; The woman shall sorowe in paynefull propagacyon.â Like as thu shalt fynde thys true in out warde workynge, So thynke the other, though it be an hydden thynge. [Exit Pater Coelestis.] Adam Primus Homo Incessaunt praysynge to the, most heavenlye lorde, For thys thy socoure and undeserved kyndenesse! Thu byndest me in hart thy gracyouse gyftes to recorde, And to beare in mynde now after my heavynesse The brute of thy name with inwarde joye and gladnesse. Thu dysdaynest not, as wele apereth thys daye To fatche to thy folde thy first shepe goynge astraye. Most myghtye maker, thu castest not yet awaye Thy synnefull servaunt whych hath done most offence. It is not thy mynde for ever I shuld decaye, But thu reservest me of thy benyvolence, And hast provyded for me a recompence By thy appoyntment like as I have receyved In thy stronge promyse here openlye pronounced. Thys goodnesse, dere lorde, of me is undeserved I so declynynge from thy first instytucyon At so lyght mocyons. To one that thus hath swerved What a lorde art thu to geve soche retrybucyon! I, damnable wretche, deserved execucyon Of terryble deathe, without all remedye, And to be put out of all good memorye. I am enforced to rejoyce here inwardelye, An ympe though I be, of helle, deathe, and dampnacyon Through my owne workynge, for I consydre thy mercye And pytiefull mynde for my whole generacyon. It is thu, swete lorde, that workest my salvacyon And my recover. Therfor of a congruence From hens thu must have my hart and obedyence. Though I be mortall by reason of my offence, And shall dye the deathe, like as God hath appoynted, Of thys am I sure, through hys hygh influence, At a serten daye agayne to be revyved. From grounde of my hart thys shall not be removed; I have it in faythe and therfor I wyll synge Thys Antheme to hym that my salvacyon shall brynge. Tunc sonora voce, provolutis genibus Antiphonam incipit, O Sapientia, quam prosequetur chorus cum organis, eo interim exeunte. Vel sub eodem tono poterit sic Anglice cantari: O eternal Sapyence, that procedest from the mouthe of the hyghest, reachynge fourth with a great power from the begynnynge to the ende, with heavenlye swetnesse dysposynge all creatures, come now and enstruct us the true waye of thy godlye prudence. [Exit Adam.] Finit Actus Primus. [Incipit] Actus Secundus [Enter Pater Coelestis and Noah.] Pater Coelestis I have bene moved to stryke man dyverselye Sens I lefte Adam in thys same earthly mansyon, For whye he hath done to me dyspleasures manye, And wyll not amende hys lyfe in anye condycyon. No respect hath he to my worde nor monycyon But doth what hym lust without dyscrete advysement, And wyll in no wyse take myne advertysement. Cain hath slayne Abel hys brother, an innocent Whose bloude from the earthe doth call to me for vengeaunce. My children with mennis so carnallye consent That their vayne workynge is unto me moche grevaunce. Mankynde is but fleshe in hys whole dallyaunce; All vyce encreaseth in hym contynuallye; Nothynge he regardeth to walke unto my glorye. My hart abhorreth hys wylfull myserye, Hys cankred malyce, hys cursed covetousenesse, Hys lustes lecherouse, hys vengeable tyrannye, Unmercyfull mourther, and other ungodlynesse. I wyll destroye hym for hys outragyousnesse, And not hym onlye but all that on earthe do stere For it repenteth me that ever I made them here. Justus Noah Most gentyll maker, with hys fraylenesse sumwhat beare; Man is thy creature, thy selfe can not saye naye. Though thu ponnysh hym to put hym sumwhat in feare Hys faulte to knowledge, yet seke not hys decaye. Thu mayest reclayme hym though he goeth now astraye, And brynge hym agayne of thy abundaunt grace To the folde of faythe, he acknowlegynge hys trespace. Pater Coelestis Thu knowest I have geven to hym convenyent space, With laufull warnynges, yet he amendeth in no place. The naturall lawe, whych I wrote in hys harte, He hath outraced, all goodnesse puttynge aparte; Of helthe the covenaunt whych I to Adam made, He regardeth not, but walketh a damnable trade. Justus Noah All thys is true, lorde, I can not thy wordes reprove. Lete hys weakenesse yet thy mercyfull goodnesse move. Pater Coelestis No weakenesse is it, but wylfull workynge all That reigneth in man through mynde dyabolycall; He shall have therfor lyke as he hath deserved. Justus Noah Lose hym not yet, lorde, though he hath depelye swerved. I knowe thy mercye is farre above hys rudenesse, Beynge infynyte as all other thynges are in the. Hys folye therfor now pardone of thy goodnesse, And measure it not beyonde thy godlye pytie. Esteme not hys faulte farder than helpe maye be, But graunt hym thy grace as he offendeth so depely, The to remembre and abhorre hys myserye. Of all goodnesse, lorde, remembre thy great mercye To Adam and Eve breakynge thy first commaundement. Them thu relevedest with thy swete promyse heavenlye, Synnefull though they were, and their lyves neglygent. I knowe that mercye with the is permanent, And wyll be ever, so longe as the worlde endure; Than close not thy hande from man whych is thy creature. Beynge thy subject he is undreneth thy cure; Correct hym thu mayest and so brynge hym to grace. All lyeth in thy handes to leave or to allure, Bytter deathe to geve, or graunte most suffren solace; Utterlye from man averte not then thy face, But lete hym saver thy swete benyvolence, Sumwhat though he fele thy hande for hys offence. Pater Coelestis My true servaunt Noah, thy ryghtousnesse doth move me Sumwhat to reserve for mannys posteryte. Though I drowne the worlde, yet wyll I save the lyves Of the and thy wyfe, thy thre sonnes and their wyves, And of yche kynde two to maynteyne yow herafter. Justus Noah Blessed be thy name, most myghtye mercyfull makerâ With the to dyspute it were unconvenyent. Pater Coelestis Whye doest thu saye so? Be bolde to speke thy intent. Justus Noah Shall the other dye without anye remedye? Pater Coelestis I wyll drowne them all for their wylfull wycked folye, That man hereafter therby maye knowe my powre, And feare to offende my goodnesse daye and houre. Justus Noah As thy pleasure is so myght it alwayes be; For my helthe thu art and sowles felycyte. Pater Coelestis After that thys floude have had hys ragynge passage Thys shall be to the my covenaunt everlastynge: The sees and waters so farre nevermore shall rage As all fleshe to drowne, I wyll so tempre their workynge. Thys sygne wyll I adde also to confirme the thynge: In the cloudes above as a seale or token clere For savegarde of man my raynebowe shall apere. Take thu thys covenaunt for an ernest confirmacyon Of my former promyse to Adams generacyon. Justus Noah I wyll, blessed lorde, with my whole hart and mynde. Pater Coelestis Farewele than, just Noah, here leave I the behynde. [Exit Pater Coelestis.] Justus Noah Most myghtye maker, ere I from hens depart, I must geve the prayse from the bottom of my hart. Whom maye we thanke, lorde, for our helthe and salvacyon But thy great mercye and goodnesse undeserved? Thy promyse in faythe is our justyfycacyon As it was Adams whan hys hart therin rested, And as it was theirs whych therin also trusted. Thys faythe was grounded in Adams memorye, And clerelye declared in Abels innocencye. Faythe in that promyse olde Adam ded justyfye; In that promyse faythe made Eva to prophecye; Faythe in that promyse proved Abel innocent; In that promyse faythe made Seth full obedyent; That faythe taught Enos on Gods name first to call, And made Mathusalah the oldest man of all. That fayth brought Enoch to so hygh exercyse That God toke hym up with hym into paradyse; Of that faythe the want made Cain to hate the good, And all hys ofsprynge to peryshe in the flood; Faythe in that promyse preserved both me and myne, So wyll it all them whych folowe the same lyne. Not onlye thys gyfte thu hast geven me, swete lorde, But with it also thyne everlastynge covenaunt Of truse for ever, thy raynebowe bearynge recorde, Nevermore to drowne the worlde by floude inconstaunt, Makynge the waters more peaceable and plesaunt. Alac, I can not to the geve prayse condygne, Yet wyll I synge here with harte meke and benygne.

If he do not sone hys wyckednesse consydre He is lyke doubtlesse to perysh all togydre. In my syght he is more venym than the spyder Through soch abuses as he hath exercysed From the tyme of Noah to thys same season hyder. An uncomelye acte without shame Cham commysed Whan he of hys father the secrete partes reveled; In lyke case Nemrod agaynst me wrought abusyon As he raysed up the castell of confusyon. Ninus hath also and all by the devyls illusyon Through ymage makynge up raysed idolatrye Me to dyshonoure; and now in the conclusyon The vyle Sodomytes lyve so unnaturallye That their synne vengeaunce axeth contynuallye. For my covenauntes sake I wyll not drowne with water, Yet shall I vysyte their synnes with other matter. Abraham Fidelis Yet, mercyfull lorde, thy gracyousnesse remembre To Adam and Noah both in thy worde and promes, And lose not the sowles of men in so great nombre, But save thyne owne worke of thy most dyscrete goodnes. I wote thy mercyes are plentyfull and endles; Never can they dye nor fayle, thy self endurynge. Thys hath faythe fixed fast in my understandynge. Pater Coelestis Abraham, my servaunt, for thy most faythfull meanynge Both thu and thy stocke shall have my plentouse blessynge; Where the unfaythfull undre my curse evermore, For their vayne workynge shall rewe their wyckednesse sore. Abraham Fidelis Tell me, blessed lorde, where wyll thy great malyce lyght? My hope is all fleshe shall not perysh in thy syght. Pater Coelestis No trulye, Abraham, thu chauncest upon the ryght. The thynge I shall do I wyll not hyde from the Whome I have blessyd for thy true fydelyte. For I knowe thu wylt cause both thy chyldren and servauntes In my wayes to walke and trust unto my covenauntes, That I maye perfourme with the my ernest promes. Abraham Fidelis All that wyll I do by assystence of thy goodnes. Pater Coelestis From Sodom and Gomor the abhomynacyons call For my great vengeaunce whych wyll upon them fall; Wylde fyre and brymstone shall lyght upon them all. Abraham Fidelis Pytiefull maker, though they have kyndled thy furye Cast not awaye yet the just sort with the ungodlye. Paraventure there maye be fiftye ryghteouse persones Within those cyties; wylt thu lose them all at ones, And not spare the place for those fyftye ryghteouse sake? Be it farre from the soch rygoure to undertake. I hope there is not in the so cruell hardenesse As to cast awaye the just men with the rechelesse, And so to destroye the good with the ungodlye: In the judge of all be never soche a furye. Pater Coelestis At Sodom if I maye fynde just persones fiftye The place wyll I spare for their sakes verelye. Abraham Fidelis I take upon me to speake here in thy presence More then become me; lorde, pardon my neglygence, I am but ashes and were lothe the to offende. Pater Coelestis Saye fourth, good Abraham, for yll dost thu non intende. Abraham Fidelis Happlye there maye be fyve lesse in the same nombre; For their sakes, I trust, thu wylt not the rest accombre? Pater Coelestis If I amonge them myght fynde but fyve and fortye, Them wolde I not lose for that just cumpanye. Abraham Fidelis What if the cytie maye fortye ryghteouse make? Pater Coelestis Then wyll I pardone it for those same fortyes sake. Abraham Fidelis Be not angrye, lorde, though I speake undyscretelye. Pater Coelestis Utter thy whole mynde and spare me not hardelye. Abraham Fidelis Paraventure there maye be thirty founde amonge them. Pater Coelestis Maye I fynde thirty I wyll nothynge do unto them. Abraham Fidelis I take upon me to moche, lorde, in thy syght? Pater Coelestis No, no, good Abraham, for I knowe thy faythe is ryght. Abraham Fidelis No lesse I suppose than twenty can it have? Pater Coelestis Coulde I fynde twenty that cytie wolde I save. Abraham Fidelis Ones yet wyll I speake my mynde, and than nomore. Pater Coelestis Spare not to utter so moche as thu hast in store. Abraham Fidelis And what if there myght be ten good creatures founde? Pater Coelestis The rest for their sakes myght so be safe and sounde, And not destroyed for their abhomynacyon. Abraham Fidelis O mercyfull maker, moche is thy tolleracyon, And sufferaunce of synne; I se it now in dede. Witsave yet of faver out of those cyties to leade Those that be faythfull though their flocke be but small.

As the [starres] of heaven so shall thy kyndred be, And by the same sede the worlde shall be redressed. In cyrcumcysyon shall thys thynge be expressed As in a sure seale to prove my promyse true; Prynt thys in thy faythe and it shall thy sowle renue.

Everlastynge prayse to thy most gloryouse name Whych savedyst Adam through faythe in thy swete promes Of the wommannys sede, and now confirmest the same In the sede of me. [Forsoth] great is thy goodnes; I can not perceyve but that thy mercye is endles To soch as feare the in every generacyon, For it endureth without abrevyacyon. Thys have I prynted in depe consyderacyon; No worldly matter can race it out of mynde. For ones it wyll be the fynall restauracyon Of Adam and Eve with other that hath synde, Yea, the sure helthe and rayse of all mankynde. Helpe have the faythfull therof, though they be infect, They condempnacyon where as it is reject. Mercyfull maker, my crabbed voyce dyrect That it maye breake out in some swete prayse to the, And suffre me not thy due lawdes to neglect, But lete me shewe forth thy commendacyons fre. Stoppe not my wyndepypes, but geve them lyberte To sounde to thy name whych is most gracyouse, And in it rejoyce with hart melodyouse.

Hys weakenesse to ayde I do the best I can, Yet he regardeth me no more than doth an hounde. My worde and promyse in hys faythe taketh no grounde; He wyll so longe walke in hys owne lustes at large, That nought he shall fynde hys folye to dyscharge. Sens Abrahams tyme whych was my true elect, Ismael have I founde both wycked, fearce, and cruell; And Esau in mynde with hatefull murther infect; The sonnes of Jacob to lustes unnaturall fell, And into Egypte ded they their brother sell; Laban to ydolles gave faythfull reverence; Dina was corrupt through Sichems vyolence. Ruben abused hys fathers concubyne; Judas gate chyldren of hys owne doughter in laweâ Yea, her in my syght went after a wycked lyne. Hys sede Onan spylte hys brothers name to withdrawe; Achan lyved here without all godlye awe: And now the chyldren of Israel abuse my powre In so vyle maner that they move me everye howre. Moses Sanctus Pacyfye thy wrathe, swete lorde, I the desyre, As thu art gentyll, benygne and pacyent. Lose not that people in fearcenesse of thyne yre, For whom thu hast shewed soche tokens evydent, Convertynge thys rodde into a lyvelye serpent, And the same serpent into thys rodde agayne, Thy wonderfull power declarynge very playne. For their sakes also puttest Pharao to payne By ten dyverse plages as I shall here declare: By bloude, frogges and lyce, by flyes, death, botche and blayne, By hayle, by grassoppers, by darkenesse, and by care, By a soden plage all their firstgotten ware Thu slewest in one nyght for hys fearce cruelnesse. From that thy people witholde not now thy goodnesse. Pater Coelestis I certyfye the, my chosen servaunt Moses, That people of myne is full of unthankefulnesse. Moses Sanctus Dere lorde, I knowe it. Alas, yet waye their weakenesse, And beare with their faultes of thy great bounteousnesse. In a flamynge bushe, havynge to them respect, Thu appoyntedest me their passage to direct, And through the Reade See thy ryght hande ded us lede, Where Pharaoes hoost the floude overwhelmed in dede. Thu wentest before them in a shynynge cloude all daye, And in the darke nyght in fyre thu shewedest their waye; Thu sentest them Manna from heaven to be their food; Out of the harde stone thu gavest them water good; Thu appoyntedest them a lande of mylke and honye: Lete them not perysh for want of thy great mercye. Pater Coelestis Content they are not with foule nor yet with fayre, But murmour and grudge as people in dyspayre. As I sent Manna they had it in dysdayne; Thus of their welfare they manye tymes complayne. Over Amalech I gave them the vyctorye. Moses Sanctus Most gloryouse maker, all that is to thy glorye. Thu sentest them also a lawe from heaven above, And daylye shewedest them manye tokens of great love. The brasen serpent thu gavest them for their healynge, And Balaams curse thu turnedest into a blessynge. I hope thu wylt not dysdayne to helpe them styll. Pater Coelestis I gave them preceptes whych they wyll not fulfyll, Nor yet knowledge me for their God and good lorde; So do their vyle dedes with their wycked hartes accorde, Whyls thu hast talked with me famylyarlye In thys hygh mountayne the space but of dayes fortye My benefyghtes all they have forgotten clerelye And so are turned to shamefull ydolatrye, For their God they have sett up a golden calfe. Moses Sanctus Lete me saye sumwhat, swete father, in their behalfe. Pater Coelestis I wyll first conclude, and then saye on thy mynde. For that I have founde that people so unkynde Not one of them shall enjoye the promyse of me For enterynge the lande but Caleb and Josue. Moses Sanctus Thy eternall wyll evermore fulfylled be. For dysobedyence thu slewest the sonnes of Aaron; The earthe swellowed in both Dathan and Abiron; The adders ded stynge other wycked persones els In wonderfull nombre: thus hast thu ponnyshed rebels. Pater Coelestis Never wyll I spare the cursed inyquyte Of ydolatrye for no causeâthu mayst trust me. Moses Sanctus Forgeve them yet, lorde, for thys tyme if it maye be. Pater Coelestis Thynkest thu that I wyll so sone change my decre? No, no, frynde Moses, so lyght thu shalt not fynde me. I wyll ponnysh them: all Israel shall it se. Moses Sanctus I wote thy people hath wrought abhomynacyon, Worshyppynge false goddes to thy honours derogacyon; Yet mercyfullye thu mayest upon them loke, And if thu wylt not thrust me out of thy boke. Pater Coelestis Those great blasphemers shall out of my boke cleane, But thu shalt not so for I knowe what thu doest meane. Conduct my people âmyne Angell shall assyst theâ That synne at a daye wyll not uncorrected be. And for the true zele that thu to my people hast, I adde thys covenaunt unto my promyses past: Rayse them up I wyll a prophete from amonge them, Not unlyke to the, to speake my wordes unto them. Whoso heareth not that he shall speake in my name, I wyll revenge it to hys perpetuall shame. The passeover lambe wyll be a token just Of thys stronge covenaunt: thys have I clerelye dyscust In my appoyntment thys houre for your delyveraunce. Moses Sanctus Never shall thys thynge depart from my remembraunce. [Exit Pater Coelestis.] Laude be for ever to the, most mercyfull lorde, Whych never withdrawest from man thy heavenlye confort, But from age to age thy benefytes doth recorde, What thy goodnesse is and hath bene to hys sort. As we fynde thy grace so ought we to report, And doubtlesse it is to us most bounteouse, Yea, for all our synnes most rype and plenteouse. Abraham our father founde the benyvolouse; So ded good Isaac in hys dystresse amonge; To Jacob thu wert a gyde most gracyouse; Joseph thu savedest from daungerouse deadlye wronge Melchisedech and Job felt thy great goodnesse stronge; So ded good Sara, Rebecca, and fayre Rachel, With Sephora my wyfe, the doughter of Raguel. To prayse the, swete lorde, my faythe doth me compell For thy covenauntes sake wherin rest our salvacyon. The sede of promyse all other sedes excell, For therin remayneth our full justyfycacyon: From Adam and Noah in Abrahams generacyon That sede procureth Gods myghty grace and powre; For the same sedes sake I wyll synge now thys howre.

David Rex Pius Remembre yet, lorde, thy worthye servaunt Moses, Walkynge in thy syght without rebuke of the; Both Aaron, Jetro, Eleazar, and Phinees Evermore feared to offende thy mageste. Moch thu acceptedest thy servaunt Josue, Caleb and Othoniel sought the with all their hart, Aioth and Sangar for thy folke ded their part. Gedeon and Thola thy enemyes put to smart; Jayr and Jephte gave prayses to thy name. These to leave ydolles thy people ded coart; Samson the strongest for hys part ded the same. Samuel and Nathan thy messages ded proclame. What though fearce Pharao wrought myschef in thy syght? He was a pagane âlaye not that in our lyght. I wote the Benjamytes abused the wayes of ryght; So ded Helyes sonnes and the sonnes of Samuel. Saul in hys offyce was slouthfull daye and nyght. Wycked was Semei, so was Achitophel: Measure not by them the faultes of Israel Whom thu hast loved of longe tyme so inteyrlye, But of thy great grace remyt her wycked folye. Pater Coelestis I can not abyde the vyce of ydolatrye, Though I shuld suffer all other vyllanye. Whan Josue was dead that sort from me ded fall To the worshyppynge of Asteroth and Baal, Full uncleane ydolles and monsters bestyall.

Eyghtene years to Eglon the kynge of Moabytes And twenty years to Jabin the kynge of Chananytes, Oppressed they were seven years of the Madyanytes, And eyghtene years vexed of the cruell Ammonytes; In thre great battayles of thre score thousand and fyve Of thys thy people not one was left alyve. Have mercye now, lorde, and call them to repentaunce. Pater Coelestis So longe as they synne, so longe shall they have grevaunce. David, my servaunt, sumwhat must I saye to the, For that thu latelye hast wrought soch vanyte. David Rex Pius Spare not, blessed lorde, but saye thy pleasure to me.

Why hast thu then wrought soch folye in my syght, Despysynge my worde agaynst all godlye ryght? David Rex Pius I have synned, lorde, I besyche the, pardon me. Pater Coelestis Thu shalt not dye, David, for thys inyquyte For thy repentaunce: but thy sonne by Bersabe Shall dye for as moch as my name is blasphemed Amonge my enemyes and thu the worse estemed. From thy howse for thys the swerde shall not depart. David Rex Pius I am sorye, lorde, from the bottom of my hart. Pater Coelestis To further anger thu doest me yet compell.

David Rex Pius I can not saye naye, but I have done undyscretelye To forget thy grace for a humayne pollycye. Pater Coelestis Thu shalt of these thre chose whych plage thu wylt have For that synnefull acte that I thy sowle maye save. A scarsenesse seven years; or els thre monthes exyle; Eyther for thre dayes the pestylence most vyleâ For one thu must have, there is no remedye.

David Rex Pius O lorde, it is I whych have offended thy grace: Spare them and not me, for I have done the trespace. Pater Coelestis Though thy synnes be great thy inwarde hartes contrycyon Doth move my stomake in wonderfull condycyon. I fynde the a man accordynge to my hart; Wherfor thys promyse I make the ere I depart. A frute there shall come forth yssuynge from thy bodye Whom I wyll advaunce upon thy seate for ever. Hys trone shall become a seate of heavenlye glorye; Hys worthy scepture from ryght wyll not dyssever; Hys happye kyngedome of faythe shall perysh never; Of heaven and of earthe he was autor pryncypall And wyll contynue though they do perysh all. Thys sygne shalt thu have for a token specyall, That thu mayst beleve my wordes unfaynedlye. Where thu hast mynded for my memoryall To buylde a temple thu shalt not fynysh it trulye; But Salomon thy sonne shall do that accyon worthye In token that Christ must fynysh every thynge That I have begunne to my prayse everlastynge.

A beare and lyon I slewe through thy strength onlye; I slewe Golias whych was six cubites longe; Agaynst thy enemyes thu madest me ever stronge. My fleshlye fraylenesse made me do deadlye wronge, And cleane to forget thy lawes of ryghteousnesse, And though thu vysytedest my synnefulnesse amonge With pestylent plages and other unquyetnesse Yet never tokest thu from me the plenteousnesse Of thy godly sprete whych thu in me dedyst plant; I, havynge remorce, thy grace coulde never want. For in conclusyon thy everlastynge covenaunt Thu gavest unto me for all my wycked synne, And hast promysed here by protestacyon constaunt That one of my sede shall soch hygh fortune wynne, As never ded man sens thys worlde ded begynne.

Oh frowarde people, geven all to superstycyons, Unnaturall chyldren, expert in blasphemyes, Provoketh me to hate by their ydolatryes. Take hede to my wordes, ye tyrauntes of Sodoma! In vayne ye offer your sacryfyce to me. Dyscontent I am with yow beastes of Gomorra, And have no pleasure whan I your offerynges se. I abhorre your fastes and your solempnyte. For your tradycyons my wayes ye set apart. Your workes are in vayne: I hate them from the hart. Esaias Propheta Thy cytie, swete lorde, is now become unfaythfull, And her condycyons are turned up so downe. Her lyfe is unchast, her actes be very hurtefull; Her murther and theft hath darkened her renowne. Covetouse rewardes doth so their conscyence drowne That the fatherlesse they wyll not helpe to ryght, The poore wydowes cause come not afore their syght. Thy peceable pathes seke they neyther daye nor nyght, But walke wycked wayes after their fantasye. Convert their hartes, lorde, and geve them thy true lyght That they maye perceyve their customable folye. Leave them not helpelesse in so depe myserye, But call them from it of thy most specyall grace By thy true prophetes to their sowles helthe and solace. Pater Coelestis First they had fathers, than had they patryarkes, Than dukes, than judges to their gydes and monarkes. Now have they stowte kynges, yet are they wycked styll, And wyll in no wyse my plesaunt lawes fulfyll. Alwayes they applye to ydolles worshyppynge From the vyle begger to the anoynted kynge. Esaias Propheta For that cause thu hast in two devyded themâ In Samaria the one, the other in Hierusalem: The kynge of Juda in Hierusalem ded dwell, And in Samaria the kynge of Israel. Ten of the twelve trybes bycame Samarytanes, And the other two were Hierosolymytanes. In both these cuntreyes accordynge to their doynges Thu permyttedest them to have most cruell kynges: The first of Juda was wycked kynge Roboam; Of Israel the first was that cruell Hieroboam; Abia than folowed, and in the other Nadab, Then Basa, then Hela, then Zambri, Joram and Achab; Then Ochosias, then Athalia, then Joas. On the other part was Joathan and Achas; To rehearce them all that have done wretchydlye In the syght of the it were longe verelye. Pater Coelestis For the wycked synne of fylthye ydolatrye Whych the ten trybes ded in the lande of Samarye In space of one daye fifty thousand men I slewe. Thre of their cyties also I overthrewe, And left the people in soch captyvyte That in all the worlde they wyst not whyther to fle. The other two trybes whan they from me went back To ydolatrye I left in the hande of Sesack, The kynge of Egipt, whych toke awaye their treasure, Convayed their cattel, and slewe them without measure. In tyme of Achas an hondred thousand and twentye Were slayne at one tyme for their ydolatrye. Two hondred thousande from thens were captyve led, Their goodes dyspersed, and they with penurye fed. Seldom they fayle it but eyther the Egipcyanes Have them in bondage, or els the Assyreanes, And alone they maye thanke their ydolatrye. Esaias Propheta Wele yet, blessed lorde, releve them with thy mercye. Though they have bene yll by other prynces dayes, Yet good Ezechias hath taught them godlye wayes. Whan the prynce is good the people are the better; And as he is nought their vyces are the greatter. Heavenlye lorde, thefor sende them the consolacyon Whych thu hast covenaunted with every generacyon. Open thu the heavens and lete the lambe come hyther Whych wyll delyver thy people all togyther. Ye planetes and cloudes cast downe your dewes and rayne That the earth maye beare out helthfull saver playne. Pater Coelestis Maye the wyfe forget the chylde of her owne bodye? Esaias Propheta Naye, that she can not in anye wyse verelye. Pater Coelestis No more can I them whych wyll do my commaundementes, But must preserve them from all inconvenyentes. Esaias Propheta Blessed art thu, lorde, in all thy actes and judgementes. Pater Coelestis Wele, Esaias, for thys thy fydelyte A covenaunt of helthe thu shalt have also of me. For Syons sake now I wyll not holde my peace; And for Hierusalem to speake wyll I not cease Tyll that ryghteouse lorde be come as a sunne beame bryght, And their just saver as a lampe extende hys lyght. A rodde shall shut fourth from the olde stocke of Jesse And a bryght blossome from that rote wyll aryse Upon whom alwayes the sprete of the lorde shall be, The sprete of wysdome, the sprete of heavenly practyse, And the sprete that wyll all godlynesse devyse. Take thys for a sygne: a mayde of Israel Shall conceyve and beare that lorde Emanuel. [Exit Pater Coelestis.] Esaias Propheta Thy prayses condygne no mortall tunge can tell, Most worthye maker, and kynge of heavenlye glorye. For all capacytees thy goodnesse doth excell, Thy plenteouse graces no brayne can cumpas trulye. No wyt can conceyve the greatnesse of thy mercye Declared of late in David, thy true servaunt, And now confirmed in thys thy latter covenaunt. Of goodnesse thu madest Salomon of wyt most pregnaunt; Asa and Josaphat with good kynge Ezechias In thy syght to do that was to the ryght plesaunt. To quench ydolatrye thu raysedest up Helias, Jehu, Heliseus, Micheas and Abdias; And Naaman Syrus thu pourgedest of a leprye. Thy workes wonderfull who can but magnyfye? Aryse Hierusalem, and take faythe by and bye For the verye lyght that shall save the is commynge; The sonne of the lorde apere wyll evydentlye. Whan he shall resort, se that no joye be wantynge: He is thy saver and thy lyfe everlastynge, Thy release from synne, and thy whole ryghteousnesse. Helpe me in thys songe to knowledge hys great goodnesse. Concinna tunc voce Antiphonam inchoat, O radix Jesse, quam chorus prosequetur cum organis. Vel Anglice hoc modo canet: O frutefull rote of Jesse, that shall be set as a sygne amonge people, agaynst the worldly rulers shall fearcely open their mouthes, whom the Gentyles shall worshypp as their heavenly lorde, come now for to delyver us, and delaye the tyme no longar. [Exit Esaias.] Finit Actus Sextus. [Incipit] Actus Septimus [Enter Pater Coelestis and Joannes Baptista.] Pater Coelestis I have with fearcenesse mankynde oft tymes corrected, And agayne I have allured hym by swete promes. I have sent sore plages whan he hath me neglected, And then by and by most confortable swetnes. To wynne hym to grace both mercye and ryghteousnes I have exercysed, yet wyll he not amende. Shall I now lose hym, or shall I hym defende? In hys most myschefe most hygh grace wyll I sende To overcome hym by favoure if it maye be. With hys abusyons no longar wyll I contende, But now accomplysh my first wyll and decre. My worde beynge flesh from hens shall set hym fre, Hym teachynge a waye of perfyght ryghteousnesse That he shall not nede to perysh in hys weakenesse. Joannes Baptista Manasses, lorde, is past whych turned from the hys harte; Achas and Amon have now momore a do. Jechonias with other whych ded themselves avarte From the to ydolles maye now no farther go. The two false judges and Bels wycked prestes also Phassur and Semeias, with Nabuchodonosore, Antiochus and Triphon shall the dysplease nomore. Thre score yeares and ten thy people into Babylon Were captyve and thrall for ydolles worshyppynge. Hierusalem was lost and left voyde of domynyon, Brent was their temple, so was their other buyldynge, Ther hygh prestes were slayn, ther treasure came to nothyng; The strength and bewtye of thyne owne heretage Thus dedest thu leave [them] in myserable bondage. Oft had they warnynges, sumtyme by Ezechiel And other prophetes, as Esaye and Hieremye, Sumtyme by Daniel, sumtyme by Ose and Johel, By Amos and Abdias, by Jonas and by Sophonye, By Nahum and Micheas, by Agge and by Zacharye, By Malachias, and also by Abacuch, By Olda the wydowe, and by the prophete Baruch. Remembre Josias whych toke the abhomynacyon From the people then, restorynge thy lawes agayne. Of Rechab consydre the faythfull generacyon, Whom to wyne drynkynge no fryndshyppe myght constrayne. Remembre Abdemelech the frynde of truthe certayne, Zorobabel the prynce whych ded repare the temple, And Jesus Josedech of vertu the exemple. Consydre Nehemias and Esdras the good scrybe, Mercyfull Tobias and constaunt Mardocheus, Judith and Quene Hester of the same godly trybe, Devoute Mathathias and Judas Machabeus. Have mynde of Eleazar and then Joannes Hircanus, Waye the ernest faythe of thys godlye cumpanye, Though the other cleane fall from thy memorye. Pater Coelestis I wyll, Johan, I wyll, for as I sayd afore Rygour and hardenesse I have now set apart, Myndynge from hens fourth to wynne man evermore, By wonderfull kyndenesse to breake hys stubberne hart, And change it from synne. For Christ shall suffre smart In mannys frayle nature for hys inyquyte; Thys to make open my massenger shalt thu be. Joannes Baptista As thy pleasure is, so blessed lorde appoynt me; For my helthe thu art and my sowles felycyte. Pater Coelestis Longe ere I made the, I the predestynate; Before thu wert borne I the endued with grace. In thy mothers wombe wert thu sanctyfycate By my godlye gyft, and so confirmed in place, A prophete to shewe a waye before the face Of my most dere sonne whych wyll come the untyll: Applye the apace thyne offyce to fulfyll. Preache to the people rebukynge their neglygence; Doppe them in water, they knowledgynge their offence, And saye unto them, âThe kyngedome of God doth cum.â. Joannes Baptista Unmete lorde I am, quia puer ego sum, And other than that, alac, I have no scyence Fyt for that offyce, neyther yet cleane eloquence. Pater Coelestis Thu shalt not saye so, for I have geven the grace, Eloquence and age, to speake in the desart place. Thu must do therfor as I shall the advyse, My appoynted pleasure fourth utter in any wyse. My stronge myghtye wordes put I into thy mouthe; Spare not but speake them to east, west, north and southe. Hic extendens dominus manum, labia Joannis digito tanget ac ori imponet auream linguam. Go now thy waye fourth, I shall the never fayle: The sprete of Helias have I geven the alredye. Persuade the people that they their synnes bywayle, And if they repent their customable folye Longe shall it not be ere they have remedye. Open thu their hartes, tell them their helth is commynge; As a voyce in desart se thu declare the thynge. I promyse the sure thu shalt washe hym amonge them In Jordane, a floude not farre from Hierusalem. Joannes Baptista Shewe me yet, good lorde. Wherby shall I knowe that man In the multytude whych wyll resort to Jordan? Pater Coelestis In thy mothers wombe of hym haddest thu cognycyon. Joannes Baptista Yea, that was in sprete; I wolde now knowe hys person. Pater Coelestis Have thu no feare, Johan, hym shalt thu knowe full well, And one specyall token afore wyll I the tell Super quem videris spiritum descendentem et manentem Super eum, hic est qui baptizat spiritu sancto. Amonge all other whom thu shalt baptyse there Upon whom thu seyst the holy Ghost descende In shappe of a dove restynge upon hys shuldere, Holde hym for the same that shall the worlde amende By baptym of sprete and also to man extende Most specyall grace. For he must repare hys fall Restorynge agayne the justyce orygynall. Take now thy journaye and do as I the advyseâ First preache repentaunce and than the people baptyse. [Exit Pater Coelestis.] Joannes Baptista Hygh honour, worshypp, and glorye be unto the, My God eternall and patrone of all puryte. Repent, good people, for synnes that now are past; The kyngedome of heaven is at hande very nye. The promysed lyght to yow approcheth fast; Have faythe, and applye now to receyve hym boldelye. I am not the lyght, but to beare testymonye Of hym am I sent that all men maye beleve That hys bloude he wyll for their redemptyon geve. He is soch a lyght as all men doth illumyne That ever were here or shall be after thys. All the worlde he made by hys myghtye power devyne, And yet that rude worlde wyll not knowe what he is. Hys owne he enterynge is not regarded of hys. They that receyve hym are Gods true chyldren playne In sprete regenerate and all grace shall attayne. Manye do recken that I, Johan Baptyst, am he: Deceyved are they and that wyll apere in space. Though he come after, yet was he longe afore me. We are weake vessels; he is the welle of grace. Of hys great goodnesse all that we have we purchace. By hym are we lyke to have a better increes Than ever we had by the lawe of Moses. In Moses harde lawe we had not els but darkenes, Fygure and shaddowe. All was not els but nyght, Ponnyshment for synne, moch rygour, payne and roughnes. An hygh change is there where all is turned to lyght; Grace and remyssyon anon wyll shyne full bryght. Never man lyved that ever se God afore, Whych now in our kynde mannys ruyne wyll restore. Helpe me to geve thankes to that lorde evermore Whych am unto Christ a cryars voyce in the desart To prepare the pathes and hygh wayes hym before, For hys delyght is on the poore symple hart. That innocent lambe from soch wyll never depart As wyll faythfullye receyve hym with good mynde. Lete our voyce then sounde in some swete musycall kynde. Resona tunc voce Antiphonam incipit, O clavis David, quam prosequetur chorus cum organis, ut prius. Vel in Anglico sermone sic: O perfyght keye of David, and hygh scepture of the kyndred of Jacob, whych openest and no man speareth, thu spearest and no man openeth, come and delyver thy servaunt mankynde bounde in prison syttynge in the darkenesse of synne and bytter dampnacyon. [Exit Joannes Baptista.] [Enter] Baleus Prolocutor The matters are soch that we have uttered here As ought not to slyde from your memoryall, For they have opened soch confortable gere As is to the helthe of thys kynde unyversall, Graces of the lorde, and promyses lyberall Whych he hath geven to man for every age, To knytt hym to Christ and so clere hym of bondage. As Saynt Paule doth write unto the Corinthes playne Our forefathers were undre the cloude of darkenes And unto Christes dayes ded in the shaddowe remayne; Yet were they not left for of hym they had promes, All they receyved one spirytuall fedynge doubtles. They dronke of the rocke whych them to lyfe refreshed; For one savynge helthe in Christ all they confessed. In the womans sede was Adam first justyfyed, So was faythfull Noah, so was just Abraham. The faythe in that sede in Moses fourth multyplyed, Lyke wyse in David, and Esaye, that after cam, And in Johan Baptyst whych shewed the very lam. Though they se afarre yet all they had one justyce, One masse, as they call it, and in Christ one sacryfyce. A man can not here to God do better servyce Than on thys to grounde hys faythe and understandynge. For all the worldes synne alone Christ payed the pryce In hys onlye deathe was mannys lyfe alwayes restynge And not in wyll workes, nor yet in mennys deservynge. The lyght of our faythe make thys thynge evydent, And not the practyse of other experiment. Where is now fre wyll whom hypocrytes comment? Wherby they report they maye at their owne pleasure Do good of themselves though grace and fayth be absent, And have good intentes their madnesse with to measure. The wyll of the fleshe is proved here small treasure, And so is mannys wyll, for the grace of God doth all. More of thys matter conclude herafter we shall. [Exit.] THUS ENDETH THYS TRAGEDY OR ENTERLUDE MANYFESTYNGE THE CHEFE PROMYSES OF GOD UNTO MAN BY ALL AGES IN THE OLDE LAWE FROM THE FALL OF ADAM TO THE INCARNACYON OF THE LORDE JESUS CHRIST.
