      <field name="fulltext">The prologue. First helth and successe with many agoode newe yeare, Wissed vnto all this moste noble presence heare. I have more tentreate youe of gentle Sufferaunce, That this our matier may have quyet vtteraunce. we that are thactours have ourselves dedicate with some Christmas devise your spirites to recreate And our poete trusteth the thinge we shall recyte maye withowte offence the hearers myndes delyte. In dede no man speaketh wordes so well fore pondred But the same by some meanes maye be misconstred, Nor nothinge so well ment, but that by somme pretence ytt maie be wronge interpreted from the auctors sence. But let this be taken no wurse then yt ys mente And I hope nor we nor owre poete shalbe shente. But nowe of thargumente to towch a worde or twayne the Name of our playe ys Respublica certaine oure meaninge ys (I saie not, as by plaine storye, but as yt were in figure by an allegorye) To shewe that all Commen weales Ruin and decaye from tyme to tyme hath been, ys, and shalbe alwaie, whan Insolence, Flaterie, Opression, and Avarice have the Rewle in theire possession. But thoughe these vices bycloked collusyon And by counterfaicte Names, hidden theire abusion Do Reigne for a while to comon weales preiudice pervertinge all right and all ordre of true Iustice yet tyme trieth all and tyme bringeth truth to lyght that wronge maye not ever still reigne in place of right. for whan pleaseth god suche comon weales to restore To theire welthe and honoure wherin thei were afore he sendeth downe his mooste tendre Compassion to cause truth goe abowte in visitation. veritee the daughter of sage old Father Tyme Shewith all as yt ys bee ytt vertue or Cryme. than dooeth Iustice all suche as Common Weale oppresse Tempered with mercye endevoure to suppresse. with whome anone is lynked tranquillitee and peace/ to Common weales Ioye and perpetuall encreace. But shall boyes (saith some nowe) of suche highe mattiers plaie? No not as disscussers, but yet the booke dothe saie Ex ore infantium perfecisti Laudem, for whan Criste came rydinge into Hieresalem, The yong babes with tholde folke cryed owte all and some, blessed bee the man that in the Lordes name dothe come.

But goddiggod echone twentie and twentie skore of that ye most longe for what wolde ye have more? ye muste pardoune my wyttes/ for I tell youe plaine I have a hive of humble bees swarmynge in my braine and he that hath the compace to fetch that I must fetche I maie saie in Counsaile, had nede his wyttes to stretche. But nowe what my name is, and what is my purpose Takinge youe all for frendes I feare not to disclose. My veray trewe vnchristen Name ys Avarice which I may not have openlye knowen in no wise, For though to moste men I am founde Commodius yet to those that vse me my name is Odius For who is so foolishe that the evell he hath wrought for his owen behouff he wolde to light sholde be brought? or who hadnot rather, his ill doinges to hide, Thenne to have the same bruted on everye syde? Therefore to worke my feate I will my name disguise And call my Name polycie in stede of Covetise. The Name of policie ys praised of eche one But to rake grumle sede Avaryce ys a Lone. The Name of policie is of none suspected, Polycye is ner of any cryme detected, So that vnder the Name and cloke of policie Avaryce maie weorke factes and scape all Ielousie.

Firste and foremoste this bagg is my veraie cleare gaine of leasses encroched and foorthwith solde againe This bag is myne intresse, of thys yeares vserie And this is of mattiers bolstred vpp with periurie This is bribes above my stipende in offecis This fifth I have by selling of benefices This ys my rentes that my clerkes yearelye render me to bee and contynue in offyce vnder me. This same I got by sectourshipp of my Mother, A vengeaunce on hir old witche for suche an other. This bag have I kepte of other sectourships whole, whiche the madde knaves woulde have scattred by penie dole. This is of Churche goodes scraped vpp withoute alawe, For which was as quicke scambling as ever I sawe, of their plate, their iewels, and copes, we made them lowtes, Stopping peoples barking with lynnen rags and clowtes, Thei had thalter clothes thalbes and amices with the sindons in which wer wrapte the chalices. This nyneth hath beguiled the king of his custome, This tenth of selling counterfaicte wares hath come. Now this eleventh is of tallowe, Butter, Cheese, Corne, Raweclothes, leather by stelth sent beyonde seaes This twelfth is of grayne, bell meatall, tynne and lead, Conveighd owte by crekes whan Respublica was in bed This thirteenth I filled throughe facing owte of dawes bothe from landes and goodes by pretence of the lawes. Thus these thirteen smale Iobbes are myne by policie All men must shifte for a poore Lyving honestlye. If er I bestowe them, yt shalbee the nexte lent to the prioure of prickingham and his covent.

Loe here a fyne felowe to have a bisshopricke a verse of latynne he cannot vnderstande, yet dareth he presume boldelye to take in hande, Into a deanerie or Archdeaconrye to choppe, And to have the liveloode awaie from a bisshopp. oppr. ?To me shewe? thie verse and leave thys perswasion.
