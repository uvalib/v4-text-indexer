      <field name="fulltext">BLUE-BEARD. A Serio-Comic Oriental Romance: IN ONE ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENERY. With a view to obviate the great difficulty experienced by Amateurs (particularly in country houses) in obtaining Scenery, &amp;c., to fix in a Drawing Room, and then only by considerable outlay for hire and great damage caused to walls, we have decided to keep a series of mounted Coloured Scenes which are ready for immediate use or they can be had unmounted on thirty sheets of strong paper and can be joined together or pasted on canvas or wood, according to requirement. Full directions, with diagrams shewing exact size of Back Scenes Borders, and Wings, can be had free on application. The following four scenes are kept in stock. GARDEN. âThe above is an illustration of this scene. It is kept in two sizes. The size of the back scene of the smaller one is 10 feet long and 6Â½ feet high, and extends with the wings and border to 15 feet long and 8 feet high. The back scene of the large one is 13 feet long and 9 feet high and extends with the Wings and Border to 20 feet long and 11Â½ feet high. It is not necessary to have the scene the height of the room, as blue paper to represent sky is usually hung at the top. Small size, with Wings and Border complete, 63s.; unmounted on paper sheets, 30s.; large size, mounted, 84s.; unmounted, 40s. Blue paper 2d. per sheet. small size. A double quantity would be required if used for the large scene. WOOD. âThis is similar in style to the above, only a wood scene is introduced in the centre. It is kept in two sizes, as the previous scene, and blue paper can be introduced as before indicated. Small size, with Wings and Borders complete, mounted, 63s.; unmounted, 30s. Large size, mounted, 84s.; unmounted, 40s. FOLIAGE. âThis is a sheet of paper on which foliage is drawn, which can be repeated and cut in any shape that is required. Small size, 30 inches by 20 inches, 1s. per sheet; large size, 40 inches by 30 inches, 1s. 6d. per sheet. TREE TRUNK. âThis is to be used with the foliage sheets and placed at the bottom of the scene.âPrice and size same as foliage. DRAWING ROOM. âThis scene is only kept in the large size, the back scene is 13 feet long and 9 feet high and extends with the Wings and Borders to 20 feet long and 11Â½ feet high. In the centre is a French window, leading down to the ground, which could be made practicable if required. On the left wing is a fireplace with mirror above, and on the right wing is an oil painting. The whole scene tastefully ornamented and beautifully coloured, forming a most elegant picture. Should a box scene be required extra Wings can be had, consisting of doors each side, which could be made practicable. Price, with Border and one set of Wings, mounted, 84s.; unmounted, 40s.; with Border and two sets of Wings, to form box scene, mounted, 105s.; unmounted, 50s. COTTAGE INTERIOR. âThis is also kept in the large size only. In the centre is a door leading outside. On the left centre is a rustic fireplace, and the right centre is a window. On the Wings are painted shelves, &amp;c., to complete the scene. A box scene can be made by purchasing extra Wings, as before described, and forming doors on each side. Price, with Border and one set of Wings, 84s.; unmounted, 40s.; with Border and two sets of Wings, to form box scene, mounted, 105s.; unmounted, 50s.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The above can be seen mounted at 89, Strand, London. Full directions accompany each Scene.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">SCENE FIRST. âA Court-yard before Fadlallah's House. Enter Selim, Fadlallah, Fatima and Ayesha, R. Fadla. Good neighbour, be quiet! my word is lawâ I have said that my daughter shall wed the Bashaw! Selim. (L.) But, neighbour, your promise! Fadla. (C.) My promise! go! With him must I break it to keep it with you? Selim. You promised me first! Fadla. But I promised him since! And what saith the Koran? âSpeak truth to thy prince!â Selim. You swore by the Prophet! Fadla. I tell thee, forbear! In abundance of words is abundance of care! And again saith the Koran, in Surah the third, âConfine not thy neighbour too close to his word!â Selim. Would you yield to this monster your Fatima's life? Why, he eats every night for his supper a wife! Fadla. Mere libellous nonsense! I tell thee, Selim, I know nothing less like a monster than him! Ayesha. (R.) Oh, father! but think on his whiskers of blue! Fadla. I tell you, the man is as rich as a Jew! I wish I could find such a husband for you! Selim. Allow me, at least, to take leave of the maid! Fadla. You may do as you pleaseâI shall not be afraid. No daughter of mine has a spirit so mean, To prefer her kab-kabs to a gilt palankeen; To trudge to the baths with no soul in her train, And wrapp'd in a shawl from the wind and the rain, When she might, if she pleased, on an elephant ride, With trumpets before her and troops by her side, And sweep through the streets like a lady of honour, Dwarfs, negroes, and eunuchs attendant upon her, Selim!âI once loved you. Be but a good boy, I'll speak to the Bashaw to give you employ. But my daughter's affianced! (Exeunt Fadlallah and Ayesha, R. Selim. (L.) Says Fatima so? Fati. (R.) I am but the slave of my father, you know. I must do as he wills, or with you, my Selim, A cottage were more than a palace with him! But, alas, 'tis in vain! and, since love is denied, I must fold my pale form in the mantle of pride,â Must loll on my couch with an indolent mien, Of a heart-chilling harem the heart-broken queen, And trifle the time while my tyrant reposes, With diamonds, and arrack, and attar of roses! Selim. I cannot endure it! The Bashaw I'll meet, I'll fling myself down in the dust at his feet. I'll tell him our story. Fati. His heart is of steel! Selim. By Allah; my dagger shall force him to feel! I'll drag from his horse the oppressor, and thenâ Fati. A peasant! and fight with a leader of men! You can but fall a victim to numbers, and Iâ! I never will live to look on, when you die! Farewell, be resign'd, take this ring for a token; So long as its stone is unblench'd and unbroken, You may know that I liveâthat I'm wellâthat I bear In peace and in patience the load of despair.â But if once its smooth surface begins to decay And the tint of the ruby to vanish away, You may learn that my life is in danger, andâpray! Selim. Yet, yet there is hope! I have told you before, My mother's an Arab, and born in Mount Hor: Her kindred disown'd her for wedding a clown; But my uncle the Shekh, as he pass'd by our town, Half-famish'd, half-naked, hard press'd by the foe, Was pleased for a moment his pride to forego, To be fed, clothed, and shelter'd, as best we were able; To be warm'd by our hearth, to he hid in our stable; And to say, on the morrow, as grimly he smiled, He would âmake me a man if I came to the wild!â In less than three days I can reach his retreat; I'll tell him my sorrows, fall down at his feet. He hates Abou Malek! Fati. But what can he do, Our tyrant so mighty, his people so few? He may rifle a pilgrim, set fire to a village, Or threaten the Monks of Mount Sinai with pillage:â But to cope with a Bashaw! Selim. No matter, I'll try! (Martial music at a distance. Fati. Good Heaven, they are here! if you value me, fly! Enter Fadlallah, R. Fadla. In, into the house, silly girl! By my beard, This moment the sound of a trumpet I heard. Would you stand in the court with no veil on your face, When his highness, your husband, rides into the place? In, inâget the clothes on he sent you this morning! And, neighbour, kind neighbour, I give you fair warning, If longer in sight of my door I survey you, I'll speak to my son-in-law's worship to flay you! (Exeunt Fatima, R. and Selim, L. Abou Malek. (speaking without, L. U. E.) Sound trumpets, a halt! My Albanians my wait, Drawn up in two lines, from the bridge to the gate! Let none dare to enter! (Entering L. U. E. Well, father-in-law. Fadla. I hope that your highness will pardon the aweâ(hesitating.) Unprepared as I am, unaccustom'd to view The shadow of one so illustrious as you! Oh, Lud! I'm afraid of those whiskers of blue! (aside.) I could speak very well if I once made a start, But 'tis gone from me clean what I'd gotten by heart. Where was I? Oh nowâ(aloud.) Will your highness be pleasedâ Abou. Slave, infidel, hound; am I thus to be teased With your bowing and cringing, and kneeling, and talking, Detaining me here from night until dawning? Go, call out your daughter, 'tis her that I seek, But you, if I let you, would chatter this week! Fadla. (aside) His highness is hasty. I dare not complain, But 'tis hard that my speech should be studied in vain, Abou. What have I forgot?âI return to the gate To give out some orders. Your daughter may wait. (Exit L. U. E. Fadla. He's a Bashaw, indeed! How I envy his state! How noble his action!ââYour daughter may wait!â Enter Fatima and Ayesha, R. Come, Fatima, girl, and give thanks on your knee For a husband so kind, condescending, and free! âGood father-in-law,â said his highness to me, âYou speak like an angel, good father-in-law;â He's the civilest gentleman ever I saw; And by the same token will make me a Cadi, So soon as my daughter comes out as his lady!â Whatâweeping, you fool? By the Caaba, I'd tear,â If it were not for rumpling that head-dress,âyour hair! I'd make you come out by the head and the shoulder! You are only too lucky! Ayesha. And that's what I told her! I'm sure she has plenty to make her content. Do look at the things which the Bashaw has sent! Such silks and such kincobs, such collars of pearl! She looks like a Peri far more than a girl. And I, her poor bride-maid, by all am confess'd As sweetly, though not so expensively dress'd. Come, keep up your spirits! do, Fatima, do! I don't think his whiskers so frightfully blue! Re-enter Abou Malek, L. U. E.âall kneel. All hail Lord of Damascus! Abou. Young woman, I come, According to promise, to carry you home. Your sister goes with you. Of course you are ready. Black eunuchs without! form a guard for your lady!â Come, kiss me! I like you! Fati. In mercy forbear! Despise me, and fix your affections elsewhere! Fadla. Perhaps, if your highness my girls would compare, This other's as handsome. Abou. But less to my taste.â Come, Fatima, rise from the groundâI'm in haste! The affairs of the East on my leisure attend.â Fadlallah! farewell! kiss with reverence the end Of this worshipful finger, which, were the whim in it, Might beckon your head from your shoulders this minute. Fati. O Bashaw! if pity e'er enter'd your breast! Abou. You have reason, I trow, to be sadly distress'd! The spouse of a Bashaw, mere maidenish stuff! I like youâhave bought youâwill keep you, enough! (Exeunt L. U. E., leading Fatima, the others following.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE SECOND. âA large hall or staircase, with many doors. Music heard without. Enter Abou Malek, Fatima, Ayesha, L. Abou. I hate all this nonsense!âthese gardens of myrtle, These long wedding suppers, how vastly absurd! These verses comparing my spouse to a turtle! I'm wed to a woman, and not to a bird! I can gaze with delight on her person and graces, And hope that the sequel fresh charms will disclose; But it bores me to hear such bombastical praises,â No nightingale I, to be gull'd with a rose! Goâorder the minstrels to silence their tabors! Bid the dancing-girls pack up their rags and be gone! Ayesha. Lord sir! you'll offend all your kindred and neighbours; The nach-girls and singers have scarcely begun! I never can find an excuse that is cleverâ They'll needs see your highness before they retire. Abou. Go tell 'em I'm sickâhave the plagueâhave a fever! Say the sherbet is out!âsay the Harem's on fire! (Exit Ayesha. lingeringly, L. I breathe at my ease now Ayesha is gone! O born in a cottage, but fit for a throne! You perchance think my manners are rough and austere; But why do you tremble?âmy Houri, draw near! I have secrets of moment to pour in your ear! Twelve years have I languish'd a partner to meet, Kind, beautiful, humble, domestic, discreet; Twelve times have I hoped that my labour was sped; Twelve times have I fail'dâfor the rest, ask the dead! Twelve damsels in turnâbut, alas! you have heard The crime which has call'd down this curse on my beard! You have heard it? Fatima. Your highness, I haveâbut I know That slander still follows the mighty. Abou. 'Tis true! Now learn the sad cause!âin my cradle when laid, My mother gave alms to a soothsaying maid, A poor crazy wanderer, in ruins that slept, And her vigils with Gouls in the monument kept, Till her soul, from the haunts of humanity driven, Grew skill'd in the visions of Hell and of Heaven, And her words of wild raving had power to unfold Whatever the eyes of the Prophet behold:â She stopt at our cottage, sate down by our door (I care not who knows itâmy parents were poor, I rose by the sabre's adventurous law, First robber, then rebel, and last a Bashaw;) But she, when relieved by our water and bread, Took the babe in her arms, prest her lips to his head, AndâYou mark me? Fati. Intently! Abou. She shudder'd and, âThou! Strange matters are written,â she cried, âon thy brow! High valour, high fortune, untimely o'erthrow! Yet, warrior, no bowstring shall bring thee thy doom,â No writ of the Sultan conduct to the tomb; Live, live, Abou Malek! fear'd, honour'd, carest, Of the chief of the Koran the boldest and best; Fear no sabres that glisten, no bullets that fly, Till a bride's curiosity doom thee to die!â Fati. Strange doom? Abou. Dost thou wonder that twelve I have tried? Dost thou wonder that they who deceived me have died? Let their fate be thy warning! Last hope of my life, Be firm! and I make thee my queen and my wife! Thou shalt rule o'er our heart, shall rule o'er Damascus, Whatever thou seek'st thou hast only to ask us! But first, to thy trial! take charge of my keys: Wherever thou wilt, they admit thee with ease. Range at will through my castle,âits wealth is thine own! But yon south turret chamber must yet be unknown! Do this and be blest! for three days we must part: Be firm,âor my dagger must smoke in thy heart! Farewell for three days! Fati. Oh, my Lord, I entreat, Show grace to my weakness! I sink at your feet! I will honour you, love you, obey you, adore! In all but this trial! Abou. It must be! no more! (Exit R. Enter Ayesha, L. Ayesha. Thank Heaven he is off! I have heard your disputeâ He a Bashaw, indeed! A fantastic old brute. Fati. You heard it? Ayesha. I listen'd, my love, at the doorâ I never have met such a monster before. Kill a woman for peeping! why here's a to-do! I wonder what's in that chamberâDon't you? Fati. Oh, talk not of prying! Ayesha. The Prophet forbid! Butâhe never could know it, my dear if we did. And now that I look, what a beautiful key! Do, Fatima, trust it a moment with me. (snatching the key. Fati. What, what are you doing? (Ayesha tries the key in the lock of the door. Ayesha. I want to be sure. If this is the key which belongs to the doorâ It fits, I declare, like a finger and glove! Fati. In mercy return it! Ayesha. Return it, my love! I have not yet turn'd it,ânor do I intend. No, child, on my prudence you well may depend! I would not for the worldâOh, my stars! it is done! (The door flies open with a tremendous sound, several skeletons seen within. The chamber is open as sure as a gun; And oh! what an object! See, Fatima, see! Oh, shut-to the door! turn the key, turn the key! Run! Run for your lifeâOh! (Fatima closes the door Fati. Wretched girl! we're undone! The key is all bloody! Ayesha. Run, Fatima, run! (Exeunt R., closed in by</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE THIRD. âA wild rocky desert, without trees or vegetation. At a small distance a cluster of low black tents. Enter Selim, with a staff, scrip, and bottle for holding water, L. Selim. To think that my uncle takes pleasure to dwell In a country whose heat the best spirit would quell! 'Tis true he's a thief, and of thieves the commander, But his quarters would puzzle the best salamander. A plague on these flints that have worn out my feet! A plague on these rocks half calcined by the heat! How dreadful these waterless vapours that make, To torture the pilgrim, the farce of a lake! Not a tree, not a spring has this wilderness in it. My pulse beats two hundred and ten in a minute. My tongue is on fire, and my brain in a muddle; I would give all the world for a good draught of puddle Then, when one least thinks of it, comes the Simoom, And these sands will supply me a couch and a tomb! Or, who can be sure but some merciful Shekh, For the sake of my garments, may twist off my neck?â Oh dear! I'm afraid!âI've a mind to turn back, But I doubt that I never shall hit on the trackâ And Fatima! Thou!âcan I leave thee in thrall? Cheer up!âa high spirit may scramble through all. AndâhurrahâI have found them! dark perch'd on the sand Like a cluster of ravens, the tents are at hand. And, sure, that's my uncleâ Enter Shekh, R. Shekh. Stand, infidel, stand! Stand, slave, and deliver! Selim. 'Tis vastly distressing, That he won't recollect me! Kind uncle, your blessing Shekh. Ha, rascal! who art thou? Selim. Oh!âlook not so grim! The son of your sister, your nephew Selim! Destroy not the seed of your father with fear! Shekh. Selim, by the prophet!âand what brings thee here? Hast thou taken my counsel, and is it thy bent To sojourn with us in the shade of the tent? To cast in thy lot with thy friends, and to rear; Dimly seen through the twilight, the long Arab spear? To mark from some mountain where, patient and slow, The rich-laden caravan circles below? Then spring to thy courser, exulting and gay, And swift as an eagle dart down on the prey! Oh, blithe are my pastimes on desert and down, Far, far from the smoke and the noise of the town; And calm my repose when the carpet is spread, 'Twixt the steed of my bosom, and the wife of my bed, When camel-bells tinkle, and embers burn bright, And the tent-curtains flap in the breezes of night! Though poor my apparel, though scanty my fare, A cake on the hearth, and a mantle of hair, How sweet is that morsel, how light is that vest, And how rich do I feel of this sabre possest! Selim. This is charming, I own; in this tranquil retreat You've the blessings of hunger, of thirst and of heat,â May you long time enjoy them; for me, when I'm bent To taste of these pleasures, I'll visit your tent. But now for protection, dear uncle, I sueâ You know the Bashaw of Damascus? Shekh. I do.â Selim. The monster has borne off my beautiful bride. Shekh. He's perfectly right for himself to provide. Selim. Is my uncle in earnest? Shekh. I am, my Selim And, thou wilt do right to assassinate him! Selim. By my beard! I intend itâbut how shall do Shekh. Oh just so thou wilt, as thou fairly goest through it.â Thou may'st shoot him, or stab him, or beat out his brain. Selim. But how to get at him?âyour meaning explain. Shekh. I have spoken!âand he who hath purpose to slay, If he have but the courage, will find out the way! If thou diest, I'll avenge thee. Selim. Far rather defend me! I hoped that the spears of Mount Hor would befriend me! You have eaten our salt, have been warm'd at our fire, And there flows in my veins the true blood of your sire. To a castle in Hauran, if truth is in fame, About Malek has borne my disconsolate dame. The walls are not strong, and the garrison few, What say you to singeing those whiskers of blue? Will you aid my revenge? Shekh. I don't care if I do. First come to the tent, share my bread and my water, And the moon of to-morrow shall light us to slaughter. Selim. Oh, pause not a moment! Shekh. And why, my Selim? Selim. The ring on my finger! its ruby grows dim! She dies,âshe is bleeding,âI see by the stone! Oh, haste, or I fly to her rescue alone! Shekh. By my headâa brave youth! I will lend thee a steed, And I and my people will help at thy need. And woe to these Turks when the whirlwind of war Is gather'd in cloud on the summit of Hor! When the locusts of Maon are dark on the blast, And the leopards of Arnonâ Selim. Oh, haste! uncle, haste! (Exeunt, R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCENE FOURTH. âAn Apartment in Blue-Beard's Castle. Fati. In vain you console me,âtoo sure is my doom, And the dews of to-morrow must weep o'er my tomb. Enough! I forgive you; 'twas Azrael's decree, That bloody my death and untimely should be. Poor captives of fate! the entangled gazelle May break through the snare of the hunter as well As we, with our wisdom, our cunning and wit, Escape from the meshes by destiny knit! Be at rest, I forgive you! Ayesha. Yet, yet we have space To contrive our escape from this horrible place. Two days have gleam'd sadly o'er dungeon and tower, Since the Lord of Damascus set forth with his power. Once more must be wash'd from the tables of fate, Ere the shade of his presence will darken the gate. And Selim, by this time, must his uncle have met. And, my dear injured sister!âI'd lay you a bet That ere our tyrant returns to our door, His way will be block'd by the bands of Mount Hor. Fati. Can Arabs contend with a warrior like him? Oh, better I die than endanger Selim! Ayesha. Yet, yet I have something to check your despairâ I have search'd through the south turret chamber, and thereâ Fati. Oh, name not the turretâthat desolate room, Where my wretched forerunners in folly and doom Lie mouldering and green! Ayesha. I beheld with afright, And horrid, most horrid indeed was the sight! But I still persevered, for there prest on my mind A suspicion of mystery lurking behind. And at length I have found it; an aperture small That leads to a stair in the bulk of the wall; Beneath it a postern conceal'd, and I hope That with me you will pack up your things and elope. Fati. No packing! no loitering! conduct me this minute! Ayesha. Law! your train will be bloodied! allow me to pin it: We have plenty of time. (looking through the door. Oh, confusion and sorrow! The Bashaw has mistaken to-day for to-morrow; He is now on the staircase.âOh, would it might crumbleâ I'd break my own neck to ensure him a tumble! Abou. (speaking without, R.) Within there! what slaves! are ye sleeping or dead? If ye sleep till the morning, your couch will be red! Am I forced like a dog of the desert to wait, No slaves at my stirrup, no guard at my gate, And unhonour'd by sign or salute from the wallâ To sneak like a thief to my own castle hall? Up, up to the ramparts! unlimber the swivels, You will soon have a visit from Arabs or devils! They are hard upon my track! Ayesha. Recollect what I told you, Cheer up! he must not in this anguish behold you; Put him off for a while if he talks of the keys, By the help of a kiss you may do it with ease. But gain a few hours, and, I'll wager my neck, Some tidings will come of Selim and his Shekh. (exit Fatima, L., Abou Malek enters R. Oh, my lord! my dear brother! such sudden delight! We never expected you home by to-night! Abou. So, so, where's your sister! Ayesha. And as I was saying, Your highness, we thought, in the city was staying; So we fasten'd the gate, sent the servants to sleep, Good hours we were always accustom'd to keep, And we were just talkingâ Abou. My curse on your head. No doubt you were talkingâ Ayesha. Of going to bed. Andâ Enter Fatima, L. Abou. Fatima! well may you boast of the charms That bring back your husband so soon to your arms, Three days I had promisedâmy heart could not wait, And the second has seen me return to your gate. Escaped from an ambush that threaten'd my life, I come with delight to my home and my wife. My wife and my queen! Yesâyour trial is o'er, And the fiend of Suspicion shall haunt me no more! But what?âAll in tearsâin confusion! Fati Great sir, Your return so unlook'd for, so sudden,âI fearâ Abou. Fear! what! Ayesha. That some sudden disaster or sickness Is the cause, mighty Lord, of your singular quickness, Then, you seem to be wearied, and I have a notion, You had better retire with a nightcap and potion. Then the ambush you mention'd has thrill'd us with fear. Who could be your foes? Abou. From Mount Hor, or Mount Seir, Some rascally Arabsâ Ayesha. My love, do you hear? (aside to Fatimaâaloud.) And pray does your highness suppose they are near? Abou. Oh, Prophet! great Prophet! if ever I come To bliss, I entreat let my Houri be dumb! Give that clapper a holiday once in thy life. But come thou to my bosom, my friend, and my wife! (to Fatima. Thy silence, thy gentleness, ever must please. AlasâI forgotâyou may give me the keys. Fati. The keys, my dread Lord? give me time to prepare, I have lost them, mislaid themâcan't tell where they are. Abou. You have lost them! mislaid them! oh, ominous word! The keys, in an instant! Fati. (kneeling and covering her face) Receive them, my Lord! Abou. (after looking at the keys, he drops them) And art thou detected, whom least I suspected? Oh, prophetess! prophetess! great was thy skill! Ayesha. (flinging herself at his feet) It all was my doing! mine, mine, be the ruin! But do not, oh, do not your Fatima kill! Abou. (turning away from Fatima) I dare not behold thee,âshould my arms once enfold thee, My purpose, I feel, in a moment would cool. Ayesha. (aside to Fatima) Yet, yet I would try himâwith compliments ply him: A husband, well flatter'd, is always a fool. Fati. Is pity so strange to a conqueror's bosom? So slight an offence must such vengeance pursue? Ayesha. Was your father a wolf? was your nurse an opossum, That your heart does not melt her distresses to view? Fati. When first from the cot of my father you bore me, I hoped for protection from peril and scorn. Abou. Oh, horror, to see thee thus kneeling before me, And kneeling in vain! I have sworn! I have sworn! (A great noise without, fire of musketry, shouts, &amp;c By Heaven! are these Arabs so close on my traces? Have the rascals such courage, such conduct and skill? For a moment I leave thee, 'twere bliss to reprieve thee, But hope not, oh, hope not to soften my will. (Exit R. Ayesha. Thank our stars! he is gone, and the castle's surrounded! Andâoh! blessed accident, here are the keys! I swear he shall keep us no longer impounded, Make off! we can get through the postern with ease. Oh! me, come again. Re-enter Abou Malek, R., who catches Fatima. Ayesha escapes, R. Abou. What, ye fiends! are ye flying? Have ye sold me to fall by the bands of Mount Hor? Ayesha. (without) Oh, hasten to rescue a lady from dying! Oh, hasten, Selim, I'm unbolting the door! Abou. Is it thus? Oh, I thank thee for giving me rest; Thy treason has taken a load from my breast! I can murther thee now without fear of relenting, And fall, if my doom is to fall, unrepenting! But live, while I print a last kiss on thy brow, The last and the sweetest! Selim. (rushing in with a drawn sabre, R.) Now, murderer, now! Turn, infidel Giaour! Abou. Is the lion at bay? Woe, woe to the hunter who stands in his way! (Fight. Ha! Peasant! well fought! that last thrust was a raker, And my businessâwill soon beâwith Monkirâand Aakir. (Falls. Enter Ayesha and Arabs, R. Abou. Oh prophetess! prophetess! well hast thou said! And Fatima, fear not! kneel down by my head! Believersâbear witness! my sins to atone, I make her my heiressâthe castle's her own! Forgive me! farewellâI had moreâbut 'tis past, The first of my wives whom I loved isâthe last! (Dies. Shekh. The Bashaw had a right to devise his estate, But the Shekh of Mount Hor has a hold on his plate! (The Shekh and his Attendants are all loaded with booty. Fati. Alas, my Lord Shekh!âyou can ne'er be repaid, For your generous assistance! Shekh. Pooh! fighting's my trade! But, Selim, in my mind, ere your union is hurried, Abou Malek had better be handsomely buried. Of weddings, poor man! he abundance has seen, But 'tis always unlucky to marry thirteen!
