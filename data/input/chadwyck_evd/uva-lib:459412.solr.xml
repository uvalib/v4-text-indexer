      <field name="fulltext">I know thou'lt aske' why I no Front do weare To take the distant eye? Not I, I sweare. To give an invitation, and no meate, Would not be thought a courtesie, but cheat. Besides, (if mine owne feares aright divine) Thou'lt find but too much Front in ev'ry line.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">TO THE NOBLE and MOST VERTUOUS LADY, Mrs. Anne Leedes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my Noble Friend Mr Edmund Prestwich, upon his Elegant POEMS. Sir, You have gently cur'd my fears, and I Congratulate Emergent Poesie, And you her Tutelar Angel, who have made Her live, and by your wit secur'd her shade By you, (his better Seneca) reviv'd Hippolitus is now grown longer liv'd; And Seneca himself that could not dye, Hath gain'd another Immortality Yet here, you but translated; when you chuse An amarous Tract, and speake your own free Muse My admiration over-reads my Eye, And I am last in the full Harmony. Ja: Shirley.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To my Worthy Friend Mr Edmund Prestwich, on his Translation of Hippolitus. Hard is thy Fate (great wit) thus to advance Thy Poem in this age of Ignorance, To send it forth in such a time as this, Where none must judge but such as judge amisse; Course sordid censurers, that thinke their eyes Abus'd if fixt, on ought but Mercuries, When honest judgements will not doubt to swear Thy work deserves an Amphitheatre. Nor is this piece such as of late hath been The tedious stuffe of Poetasters seen, Wit to a nobler height, doth thine intend; No common labour to no common end: For by thy Version wee are taught anew, T' interpret what we vainly thought we knew But still mistook; so that in this we finde Thou canst do Miracles, and cure the blinde. The Orac'lous mist from Seneca is fled, Which with fresh Laurel, crowns his verdant head, And the black curtain of his clowded sense, Is drawn by thy exact Intelligence. Hippolitus that erst was set upon By all, mangled by mis-construction Dis-membred by mis-prision, now by thee And thy ingenious Chirurgerie; Is re-united to his limbs, and grown Stronger as thine, then when great Theseus son. Go on then wits example, and revive, What none but such as thee, can keep alive; Slack not the work for want of Industry For not a line, of those thou writ'st can die. Char: Cotton.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his most Honoured and most Ingenious Friend, Mr. Edmund Prestwich, upon his happy Translation of Seneca, his Tragedy of Hippolitus. VVretched Translators! they who only know How like the Moon reflections faint to show To those benighted Ignorants that dare Not look upon the Sun in his own Sphear; That their Translations are the Authors Hell Where nothing but their ghastly shaddows dwell. Thine's a Pathelion in height and glory Yet not prodigious nor transitorie. By this thy Version Seneca doth get, A better Genius fresher bayes hath met. What can I say, but thou translat'st him even, As God would man from Paradise to Heaven; But sin those coppies blur'd so that but one True Manuscript could find Translation. Hippolitus hath such a handsome Mine Drest by thee; thy Muse, worse than th' Attick queen Will I'm afraid in this transplanted Grove Incestuously her own Issue Love. Hee's truly Virbius, for thou hast done More for him now, then erst did PhÅbus sonne; When his torn limbs lay like a shatter'd lute He them patch'd up, with new breath did recruit. In Miracles yet him thou dost out-doe Giv'st other life and that Immortall too. Joves Vengeance damp't his art, that durst controul The Laws of Fate, bring home a once fled soul. Thine to doth thee to Heavens envy raise, But th'art secure from thunder by thy bayes But why translate, gild, hatch, why not appear Thy solid self, sad Ingot, neat, not tear, As when men court the Maidenhead of light, Desire to see the first, first rayie flight Of PhÅbus shafts, they face about to th' West There see some cliffe kist by the new-come Guest; So in the ponent of things past must we Look for thy day-break, and lo there we see Thy dawning wit, with early glory play On this Iberian Mount of Corduba. And I'm content, 'cause my weake eyes are able To see thy Sun thus in the water dabble; But risen to his Zenith, Oh, who can Stare at thy Halos, when Meridian? Cromwel Stanhop.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his much Lov'd Friend Mr Edmund Prestwich on his Translation of Hippolitus. Dearest, Mistrust not; thy Hippolitus, Will rellish much, with God with Us, And I'm ascertain'd that this Nation, Likes nothing like to a Translation. Ric. Rogers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his Honoured and Ingenious Friend Mr. Edmund Prestwich on his Translation of Hippolitus. To say that now the Pedant understands Words, which no comment open'd to his hands Or sense, his brains less able to obey, Than patience, or the forgotten quarter-day, Were praises of a pestilence more dead Than thunder, t' blast thy Laurel 'bout thy head. To bring thee commendations from their schools Were to translate the wisemen into fools As if we added unto Books more state By Imprimaturs fetch'd from Billinsgate. No, to praise thee's to shew this age of ours How far thy Fancy, outwings Cesars powers, He, who joynd seas, &amp; piniond Neptuns arms Affrighted Nature with the wild alarms Of his Triumphant madness might transfer His hand ore th' life of that Philosopher, Thy Poets Ancestor, which to restore Must make ev'n vanquish'd Nero cry no more Here all my Powers make Alt; but thou hast made Thy Poet a new body to his Shade; Not the long sleep of fifteen hundred yeers, Nor the confusion of inrich't Sepulchers, Where's better part lay gnawn on by those moths Of happy Spirits, ignorance &amp; goths; Affright thy daring Genius thou dost state The laws of Nature, and decrees of Fate Bidst massie Marble, her entomb'd up give: Command'st ev'n dust, re-animate and live: Mak'st this Tragedian, by new life be known Less signall in all Tragedies than's own. He lives in greater beauty than wh? th'throng Of ravish'd Romans fed their ears with's song. Thus Poets, (if their happy thought can clime But to as high an excellence as thine) Like the last Angel in th'dissolvent skies, Bid but the dead awake, and they arise. Edward Williams.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his Honoured and Ingenious Friend Mr. Edmund Prestwich, upon his Poems, and Translation of Hippolitus. Most men wil sure mistake when they behold My rustick Muse, thus confidently bold Entruding in your Front; till they shall know Her humbler pride, conceal'd her far more low Until surpris'd, commanded, and confin'd, Unto this height, by your Magnetick minde Which you so richly have Imbodyed here Though in anothers mould; you can appear (I do believe in full as various shapes As Jupiter ere did to act your rapes Upon our Muses, since your curious art Hath wrought a miracle of this desert Which (like a Verger) I would stand and tell Did not its Character too much excell My crepid fancy, whilst by your Translation As by a Magically replantation From the vitriall form, old Seneca y've rais'd In as full verdancy, as his most prais'd, And vigorous youth, h've rendred him before Both Symetry, and Features, and whats more Given life by Tragedy; Founding your Art In true Pilosophy, which you impart In lively Helycon to th' torrid wits Of our poore panting times, where nought befits The raging humour, but what's worthless born Mean as the age; beneath a Poets scorn. Though some there are, whose true born Eagle eies, Will rightly scan it, and return the prize Of ful grown Laurel, to the full blown Muse Of your yet springing brow; none will refuse To add a branch unto that wreath; whilst I Thus like a shade contentedly stand by. A Sable Foil dropt on the beauteous Front And yet not cast the least of Lustre on't Your Humble devoted Mat. Carter.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">HIPPOLITUS ENGLISHED. Actus Primi. Scena Prima. Enter Hippolitus, and divers servants, as to Hunting. Hip. Go, and surround the shady woods, and those High cliffs, which do impale the mountains brows Disperse, and with your quickest speed descry Those ragged quarries under Parnes tye View the Thriasian vales, and banks which are Worn by the force of rapid torrents, there Clime up these hils, which with obdured snow Are ever crownd. Some of you this way go Where the high aldars into arbours tye The woods, where those embroidered fields do lie Which Zephyr, quickning with his dewie breath Decks with those flowers he called from beneath Where smooth Ilissus runs flank'd on both sides With Isicles, where slow Meander glides Ore th' equall fields, and frets the sterile shore Run with unprofitable waters ore. Take you the left path, whence the woods descry'd To Marathon, where beasts, accompani'd With flocks of yonglings, do their stomacks right Grown bold by the protection of the night. Go you more Southerly, and take the way Leads to frost-thawing Acarnania. The rock of sweet Hymetus you: the small AphidnÃ¦ you must visit; this Part shall Yet rest, where the embowed Ocean doth On Suniori beat it self into a froth. Whoever hath a soul with Glory fir'd Him Philalis doth call Lo here retir'd Lies the fierce Boar, the lab'ring Husbands fear But too well known, now by those wounds they wear Slip you the silent dogs, and you restrain Th' impatient courage of th' Molossian: And let the struggling Cretensian Bitch With her bald neck the stubborn Collar stretch. But have a care that straighter couples hold The fiery Spartane, for the dog is bold And eager after game, the time draws nigh The caves shall Eccho back, the deep mouth'd cry Now may they, while the dawning lasts, while yet The dew retains the figure of their feet, The air examine with a curious guest, And on the nose run to the holds 'oth' beast; While he, bowing beneath the burthen, beares The more unus'd, lay you the lesser snares. The painted counterfeit, from thence will speed The frighted Beasts, into our toils indeed Do you a light and missile javelin shake, But you in either hand a Boar-spear take And so employ your might, in ambush laid Drive you the game, by your loud cryes dismaid Headlong into our nets; and as for you Embowell what we happen to subdue! Assist sacred Virago, for thou art Sole Queen of the worlds solitary part: Thy never-erring shafts the Beasts doe slay That drinks the cold Araxes, or doth play In frozen Ister: Cretan Harts by thee And Lybian Lions persecuted be: Now lightly woundest thou the flying Buck To thee, the spotted Tigre to be struck Proffers his brest; Thou for thy ease mayest take The Buffs broad horns, or the Buls humbled back Whatever feed in deserts, whether they Be known to the rich-grov'd Arabia, Or needy Garamas, let their abodes, Be in Pyrenean Cliffs, or Hircan woods, They and the vagabonding Scythians bear To thy Artillery an awfull fear. Whose Piety hath thee's Associate made, Broke by no feet, his nets have fettered The captiv'd Beasts; the Cart hath seemd to groan, Under the weight of the brave prey thereon. Then the Dogs Snouts in blood are dy'd, then come The glorying Huntsmen, as in Triumph home. Hearken, my Dogges do spend, and the hot cry Assures me I have pleas'd her Deity. I'm summon'd to the woods, this way Ile take Whereby I may the shorter journey make. Exit. Scena Secunda. PhÃ¦dra. Nurse. Ph. O Crete, great Soveraign of the Seas that be Replete with ships, on each side coasting thee, All such as plough the Deep, and cut their way Thorow these Floods, open t' Assyria; Why am I hostage, where I hate? or why, Given in Marriage to my Enemy, To be drawn out in misery and teares, Hast thou condemnd the remnant of my yeares? My wandring Husband absent Theseus hath Not in his Marriage, lost his wonted faith. Champion to an audacious Suitor now The Hero stalketh in the dark below; Pluck'd from the throne of the infernall King These mad-men Proserpine again will bring. Nor fear, nor sence of shame restrain him: Thus The glorious Father of Hippolitus. In Hell it self endeavoureth to meet With lowless pleasures and forbidden sheets. But (ah) I am with greater weights opprest Not from my cares by Night or sleep releast: The Ill is nourish'd, which too fast doth grow And burns within; so vapours straitned flow From the wombe of Ãtna idle stands The loom, the shittle falleth from my hands. Now in their Temples do I take no care To bribe the Gods with vows to hear my prayer Nor 'twixt the Altars, joyn'd with Attick Dames, Shake in those silent Duties conscious flames. Nor with chast Prayers, and pious rites draw near The Goddess, that PrÃ¦sides by conquest here. I rather would pursue the roused beast My soft hand with a rugged javelin prest. O! whither will my vexed soul? Alas, Why Frantick, doe I thus affect the chase? My mothers crime was fatall now I prove And in the Woods have plac'd my sinful Love. Mother, I doe repent thee now. Thou took A Bull, wild, and impatient of the yoke. Distemper'd with thy ill, thy lust prefer'd The Fierce Conductor of the Salvage herd. Yet did he something love: What God can ease, What Dedalus can quench such flames as these Should he return, whose powerfull Art did build The Labyrinth my Brothers Monster held He could not help, my case admits of none Venus offended with the tell-tale Sun, On us his off-spring doth revenge the Gyves She, and her Mars sustain'd, who ere derives Herself from Sol, Venus depraves her mind None dead with Love, but Love and impious joyn'd. Nu. Thou wife of Theseus, and the child of Jove From thy chaste brest drive this unseemly Love: Quench me these Flames, nor yeeld to such a hope As may affright thee. He who gives a stop And a Repulse to Love at first, hath bin Victor, and Safe: who cherishes the Sin, Too late denyes to undergo the yoke Himself put on: Neither am I mistooke In Princely tumors, how the stubborn mind Scorns truth, and will not be to right inclind, The Fates decrees are welcome, who are old To see their end approaching grew more bold. First wilt t' oppose, nor faulter in that will, 'Tis next to modesty to know in ill A measure. Wretch! what wilt thou do? Ah, why Dost thou increase thy houses infamy, And overact thy Mother? this exceeds Her sin, and more than monstrous be thy deeds. For to compulsive Fate we attribute Monsters, but sins to manners we impute Think'st thou thy crime more safe and void of fear 'Cause Theseus sees not what is acted here? Thou art mistaken, for suppose he dwell For ever there, doom'd t' a perpetuall Hell. What will thy Father doe; thy Father aws The Sea, and gives a hundred Cities Laws: And Parents are quick-sighted; What will he Winke at so horrid an Impiety? But grant our craft, or circumspection might Conceal it from him. What will that great Light Of all things, Father to thy Mother doe? What the Gods fruitfull Seminator, who As he his Thunder brandishes, doth shake The trembling world? are these like to mistake Canst thou yet hope unseen, to keep thy crime From these All-seeing Grandfathers of thine? But say the fav'ring Deities should hide The fact, and (as it does great sins betide) None credited thy incest: yet thou'lt finde A present pain, a self accusing mind, With horror big, and of is self afraid, Some unreavel'd, none sin unpunished. Bridle thy impious love, a crime which yet No barb'rous Nation ever did commit: To Goths, and Scythians, and those who on Inhospitable Taurus dwell unknown. From thy chaste brest expell these strange desires, Thy Mother warnes thee from such uncouth fires: Shall Son, and Father have one common bed, Thy impious womb fill'd with a mixed seed? Well, doe; with thy illicite flames make war 'Gainst Nature, and impose new Laws on her. We are at want of Monsters, and of late Thy Brothers Court (alas) is desolate! Shall unaccustom'd births the world appall And Nature be as oft unnaturall As a Cretense shall love? Ph. I know dear Nurse, Your counsel's good, but I must follow worse; Fury compelleth: Wittingly I stray, Striving in vain my judgement to obey, So when an over-burdened ship receives The unwelcome Buffets of encountring waves, Vain is the Seamans toil, in spite of them The Vessel goes with the prevailing stream. Love reason vanquishes, and countermands Nor will admit a Rivall where he reigns, His Kingdome is the World, he hath great Jove Scorched with the unruly flames of Love. Fired the brest of the stern God of war. And the dread-thunder-forging Mulciber; He, who in Ãtna, doth for ever turn, The glowing Embers with a spark doth burne PhÅbus himself who aims his shafts so true, By the more skillful Boy is wounded too. Grievous his power in Heaven, in Earth the same. Nu. Lust fav'ring Vice did first this Godhead frame And that it might the greater freedome have The name of Deity to fury gave. Condemn'd (forsooth) by Venus for to live Thorough the World a restless fugitive He, as he through the yeelding air doth sly, Fashions his troublesome Artillery; And now this Little one so great is grown The Gods submit to his dominion. These Vanities were feignd: Some guilty mind To her a Godhead, him a bow assign'd. Swell'd with prosperity who flows in Vice Not daining to admit one pleasure twice; Lust the companion of great Fortunes waits On him: he is not pleas'd with wonted cates Firm-builded houses, nor your grosser meat. Why doth this Pallace-haunting plague retreat From humble roofs? a pious Love dwells there: The Vulgar have affections void of fear. Princes, and rich men will have more than right When meaner men can curb their appetite. Who but too much can doe, yet would that he Could more. Consider thou thy quality And thy returning Husbands Scepter fear. Ph. Alas Love swayes his powerfull Scepter here And I fear no returns, none gone from hence To the dark house of death find passage thence. Nu. Be not too credulous, say the gates of Hell Were shut, and Cerberus the Centinell: Theseus hath forc'd the way hath bin forbid. Ph. Yet he perhaps would pardon, if did. Nu. Why He was cruell to a wife was chaste Antiope can testifie his hast. But grant we might appease thy angry Spouse, Yet who can move the stern Hippolitus? He doth abhor the very name of wife, And obstinately vows a single life. Marriage he shuns, an Amazon thou knows. Ph. Stay, he in mountains crown'd with frequent snows, Or fly he over the sharp rocks; I will Follow him through the woods, and ore the hils. Nu. Will he be tempted who resisteth Love? Will he chaste pleasures for unchast remove? Be kind to thee, for whom (perhaps) alone He hates the sexe? Ph. With prayers he may be won. Nu. Hee's cruell. Ph. Love tameth the cruell too. Nu. Hee'l flie. Ph. Flie he by Sea, I will pursue. Nu. Remember thou thy Father. Ph. We doe call Our Mother too, to memory withall. Nu. All woman-kind he hates. Ph. I am the more Secure, of being rival'd with a whore. Nu. Theseus will come. Ph. And Pyrithous together. Nu. Thy Father'l come. Ph. What Ariadnes Father. Nu. By these dear brests, by these time-dyed hairs, And by this bosome over-worn with cares, I pray thee have compassion on thy selfe. For to desire it is a peece of health, Ph. I have not lost all shame: Nurse I obey. The Love I cannot rule I conquer may. Thou shalt not suffer in thy Fame; this is The onely reason bridles my amiss. My Husband will I follow, and prevent My sin by death. Nu. Dear Madam, some restraint, Give to these passions. I the more esteem Your life, because you do your self condemn. Ph. Yes, dye I will: but whether halter, knife, Or leap from Pallas tower conclude my life I know not yet. Oh that my chastity Can only guarded by selfe-ruine be. Nu. What think'st thou me? so impotent my age To suffer this? yet moderate thy rage. Ph. To such as merit, and resolve to dye Reason in vain doth urge the contrary. Nu. Thou onely comfort of my aged yeares, Since so perverse, a fate thy will ore bears, Contemn thy fame. Fame speaks not as it shou'd Good to the bad, and bad unto the good. Let us assay him, and this Nature prove, So froward, so intractable to Love. This labour shall be mine; Ile undertake The Stubborn youth, and exorable make. Exeunt. CHORUS. Goddess, the off-spring of the troubled floud, And Mother to as troublesome a God, The twin'd Cupid; with what a certain aim, Alike immod'rate in his flames and them, The boy his shafts doth levell! the disease Creeps through the marrow and impoverishes With an insinuating fire the veins. The Wound appeareth not in scars, but pains Within, ransacks the very bones; this boy To peace is a professed enemy. Thorow the world, his shafts are nimbly thrown, Those Coasts that first salute the rising Sun, Or hid him last good night: those that do sweat Under the torrid Crabs consuming heat, And those which doe beneath the cold Bear freeze, Peopl'd but with uncertain Colonies Have felt these flames; in youth he blows the fire, Reviveth age-extinguished desire In crazed limbes, and the cold Virgins snow Melts with a warmth her bosome doth not know. At his command the Gods forsake the skies, And borrowed shapes obscure their Deities. PhÅbus his harp layes by; unequall reeds Gather the herd he in Thessalia feeds. How often hath the cloud-dispelling Jove Bin clothed in the meanest shapes for love? Now like a Swan he claps his silver wings, And sweeter than the dying true one sings. Now like a wanton Steer in play doth take The Royall Virgin on his humbled back, With his oare-imitating feet he plyes His brothers waves, and unknown Realms descries; He breaks the Sea with his opposed brest, Of his fair Rape, fear'd to be disposest. The clear-fac'd Goddess of the night hath burn'd, And over her forsaken Chariot turn'd To her unskilful Brother; now the Sun Doth learn to drive two horses, and doth run, A shorter course; day rises slowly, and night, Keeps no proportion with the wronged light Retarded by the unaccustom'd weight. Alcides hath his quiver laid aside, And the NemÃ¦an Lions dreadfull hide; Now he the Emrauld to his finger fits And his neglected hair in order sits. With gold-embroidered buskins he doth bind His legs, his feet, in yellow socks contein'd, And with that hand in which the club was born He twists the threed, and doth the spindle turn. Persia, and fruitfull Lydia saw the skin Of the fierce beast lye by rejected then; And those huge shoulders, which did once support And serve for pillars to the heavenly Court, Clad in a Pall with Tyrian purple dy'd, The fire is sacred, (credit those have try'd) And but too potent; for as far as land By the salt Ocean is invirond, and The scattered Stars illuminate the Skie, Reaches the Kingdom of this peevish boy. Though guarded by the interposed seas, His darts have wounded the Nereides; Nor could the Ocean quench the kindled flame, The feather'd Nation too hath felt the same, By lust provok'd; how the fierce Bull hath warr'd To be the sole Commander of the Herd! The tim'rous Hart his rival once in sight, Fearles, himself addresses to the fight; And testifies his fury with his voice. Then the black Indies tremble at the noise, Of spotted Tigres: Then, all white his mouth. With rage engendred foam, the wild Boar doth His deadly tushes whet: The Lyon when He feels this sting of Love, his horrid mane Tosses on high, the very forrest faints Then with the noise of her inhabitants. The Monsters of the deep this power have prov'd, Both they, and the Lucanian Oxe have lov'd. Nature doth claim a priviledge in all, Her yoke is universall, hate doth fall At the command of Love, that ancient fire Extinguish'd by the new one of desire, Why should I more rehearse? it is enough We see a Step-dames bosome not of proof Against the Strok of Love. What news bringst thou? Speak Nurse, and say, where thou hast left her now. Finis Actus Primi.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundi. Scena Prima. Nurse. Nu. No hope can salve this sore, nor wil that fire Be ever quench'd which frenzy raizes higher Although no crackling flame, although conceald In her close brest, 'tis by her face reveal'd; Her eies doe sparkle, and her shrunke cheeks flie The light. Best pleased with variety Is her divided soul; her body feels The motion of her troubled sprite and reels. Now her faint limbs a dying measure tread, And scarce her weary neck sustains her head; Now would she rest a while, but straight forbears Forgotten sleep, and spends the night in teares: She rises, and again is laid: Shee looses Her scattered tresses, and again composes; She varies habit, weary of her self, And grows regardles both of food and health; She languishingly goes, her strength decay'd And from her cheeks the wither'd roses fade. Care doth dissolve her joynts: a trembling pace She holds, not near so comely as shee was. And those same eyes, that testified her line From PhÅbus, nothing like her Grandsire shine. Still are her cheeks with teares bedewed: so A warm showr melteth the dilated snow Upon the cliffs of Taurus; but behold The Court is ope, where on a couch of gold Leanes the inclined Lover, and her brain Distemperd, doth her own attire disdain. Ph. Good maids these gold and purple garments bear From hence, what should the Tyrian dye doe here? Or wooll, which the trees mollified rind Yeelds to the Sexes? a short Zone shall bind My loins, for expedition girt; no load Of pearl, on us by Indian Seas bestowd, Shall lengthen out my cares, nor will I deck With any Carkanet my widdowed neck. No perfume my dishevel'd hair doth need, Careless upon my neck and shoulders spread, And by the wind displayed, my left shall bear A quiver, and my right hand shake a spear. Such was Hippolita, and as she guides From frozen Tanais, and MÃ¦otis sides Her troops to Attick coasts, her hair collected Into a knot, and then again rejected; A Crescent shield gaurding her side, even so Accoutred I, into the woods will goe. Nu. Complain no more, grief doth not ease (great Queen) The wretched. Wil the fire observe a mean? Invoke the Virgin Goddess of the wood. Hail sacred Queen of forrests, whose abode Alone is on the hills; alone who art There worshipped, these dire portents avert. Thou, the woods awfull Deitie: the bright Planet of Heaven, the ornament of night, One of the worlds alternate lamps, the trine Aspected Hecate favour our design. Tame this hard-hearted youth, that he may learn To love, and with a mutuall ardour burn; Incline his cares, his brest unarme, his mind Ingraft in hers, though froward, harsh, unkind; Let him pay Venus homage, thus thy might Employ. So still unshaded be thy light. Through the dispersed clouds making thy way With thy resplendent horns: so from thy sway May no Thessalian Witches thee constrain, Nor thou thy honour forfeit to a Swain. Goddess invok'd, thou'st heard my prayer, lo now I see him paying of his yearly vow. Alone he is, wherefore are these delayes? Art must be us'd. Fortune gives time and place. What tremble I? 'tis hard for to obey A Crime, but he that fears a prince must lay Conscience aside, and modesty expell, The bashfull never serv'd a Monarch well. Scena Secunda. Hippolitus. Nurse. Hip. Thy weary steps why hither bendest thou With such a clouded face, &amp; troubled brow, Good Nurse? I hope my Father is not dead, Nor PhÃ¦dra, nor the pledges of their bed. Nu. Fear not, obsequious Fortune, on thy house, Still waits, and still the land is prosperous. But thou, mild as thy houses fate, to me, Give ear, who 'm so sollicitous for thee; Because thou thus afflictst thy self, whom fate Makes wretched, we may wel comiserate; But who court danger, and themselves abuse With needless tortures, they deserve to loose Those blessings which they knew not how to use. Rather in pitty of thy yeers, thy mind Release, and in a festive measure joyn'd, Advance thy torch; in wine thy sorrows drown Enjoy thy youth, which will be gone too soon. Now apt for all Impressions is thy brest, Venus to yong men, is a welcome guest. Now glad thy soul: Why shouldst thou lye alone? Solace thy youth, but too unpleasant grown: Slacken the reins, wholly to riot bent. Nor let thy better dayes be thus mispent. The Gods draw out our lives by their degrees Allotting them peculiar properties. Cheerfull when yong, in age reserv'd. Why doth A hard restraint thus kill thy toward youth? A large encrease shall crown the husbands toil, Whose seed is tightly fitted to his soil: And all the trees are over-grown by those Which still uncropt preserve their maiden boughs. Good dispositions greatest praise doe merit When nat'rall freedom guides a noble spirit. Salvage, and ignorant, thou to a wife Preferr'st a melancholy single life. Dost thou thinke toil a priviledge? to ride The fierie courser till he lose his pride, Or try the bloudy issue of a field? When the eternall providence beheld So many enemies to life he made Fresh off-springs to replenish the decay'd. Go too. Let Venus of humane affaires Dispose, who our diminish'd stock repairs; Should but our youth be barren all thou sees, After an ages standing vanishes. Coverd'with rubbish, the uncultur'd land Would lye, the sea unnavigated stand, The empty forrest; beasts, air, birds would want, The wind being the sole inhabitant. How many casuall deaths on mankind wait, Extinguish'd by the sea, the sword, deceit! But say that these were wanting: yet to all For to pursue their end is naturall. Nature the guide of life, obey'd, frequent The Citty then, and publike meetings haunt. Hip. There is no life more free, void of offence, Or nearer to the pristine Innocence, Than what is to the woods confind, who lives With a clear Conscience on the mountains cliffs Is not enflam'd with avarice, nor draws The aire of seldome merited applause. Is not with envy swell'd, nor kindnes blown, Nor favorite, nor vassall to a crown. He covets not vain honours, nor th' uncertain tide Of wealth, not hope and fear doe him divide Him scarce the poisonous tooth of malice wounds Nor doth he know the usuall crimes of towns, And great concourses, feares not every noise Like guilty persons, nor inventeth lies; A thousand Columes don't his roof uphold, Nor are his rafters fastened with gold. His Altars doe not flow with streams of blood, Nor, with the sacred meal, their foreheads strew'd, A Hecatombe of white oxen expects The stroak of death, and bow their hundred necks. But he the countrey doth enjoy, endu'd With a most sweet and pleasing solitude. Harmless he wanders through the open air, Nor can he any thing but beasts ensnare. And, when with labour faint, his weary limbs Refreshes with Ilissos Chrystall streams. Now he on bankes of swift Alpheus lyes, Now thickest coverts of the wood descries, (Where cool Lerna through her transparent spring Shews her clear bottome,) ever wandering. Here birds complain, there th'ancient Beech receive Some gentle wind, and shakes her tremblng leaves Strech'd on a winding shore he loves to take A nap, and the bare turfe his bed doth make; Whither a fountain falls in scatter'd showers, Or flying streams salute the new-born flowers With murm'ring courtship: Wildings are his food, And strawb'ries gather'd from the underwood. Meats quickly cooked, he delights to fly Far from the Courts excessive luxurie, Let the ambitious drinke in golden cups. With what a gust he the pure fountain sups From his convexed palm; and sleep more sound Securely laid on the obdurate ground. He lewdly seeks not a retired bed, Nor in close corners hides his fearfull head: But he doth the fresh air, and light enjoy, And that he liveth, Heaven can testifie. I verily beleeve those Heroes did Live thus whom after ages Deifi'd. They had no thirst of gold, no sacred stones Did limit their unknown possessions. Bold ships plough'd not the deep, to forreign shores; But kept to their own seas, no lofty towres And ample bulwarks did the city fence, In armes an universall ignorance. No engines forc'd the gates, no oxen plough'd The earth; she wore no badge of servitude, Flelds fruitfull of themselves suffic'd to feed A sparing people that did little need. Woods native riches, and some shadie cave To them unartificiall lodgings gave. First headstrong wrath, a furious love of gain, And lust, which in enflamed minds doth reign, Broke this integrity, then did there come A bloody thirst of Empire in the room. Great men did prey upon the less, and might Was chosen arbitrator unto right. Then with bare hands they fought: untrimed boughs And stones were the first weapons they did use. The cornell was not shod with ir'n, nor ty'd The souldier a long sword unto his side, Nor horses manes crested their helmes; but vext With smart they took the weapons that were next. Dire Mars invented war-like stratagems, And thousand forms of death, hence purple streams Defil'd each land: bloud dy'd the blushing mane Then endles crimes in ev'ry house did reign: No sin but grew a President; the child, His Father, Brothers have their Brothers kill'd, Women their Husbands, wicked Mothers slew Their infant births. What then did Step-dames doe Nothing indeed's more mild than beasts, but this Woman, sins ringleader and Artifice Besets our souls, how many Cities are Fir'd by her Incests, lands ingag'd in war, And peoples by the ruin'd weight opprest Of their own Countries? not to name the rest: Medea speaketh the sexe cruell. Nu. Why. Condemn'st thou all for ones Impiety. Hip. I flie, abhor, curse all. Whether it from Reason, or nature, or meer frenzy come: I love to hate them: Water shall abide Sooner with fire: Vessels securely ride In the devouring Syrtes; the bright day Sooner shall rise from the Hesperian Sea, And wolves be mild to kids, than this my mind Admit a courteous thought of woman-kind. Nu. Love, the perverse oft tameth, and removes All hatred this thy Mother Country proves. Ev'n that fierce Nation did obey the will Of Love, or thou hadst been ungotten still. Hip. In this respect I'm glad my Mothers dead, Because my hate is now unlimited. As a fix'd rock on every side, in vain Assail'd by waves, doth beat them back again; So he despises what I say: but see Where the impatient lover comes (ah me) What Fate attends her? whither falleth shee? Upon the earth her body breathless lyes, And death-like paleness doth benight her eyes, Madam look up, unloose your tongue, behold, Hippolitusses arms do you enfold. Scena Tertia. PhÃ¦dra. Hippolitus. Nurse. VVho calls me back to grief; my bosome fir'd A new? how sweetly had I here expir'd? But why refuse I life? courage my mind, Try, execute what thou thy self injoyn'd. Speak boldly, she, who fearfully doth crave, Begs a deniall; my worst crime I have Acted long since. Shame commeth now too late, I've lov'd a sin, if in it fortunate, A Husbands name may palliate the deed; Those sins are oft thought honest, which succeed. Go too, begin my soul. Sir, I a while desire Your privacy: let all the rest retire. Hip. See here is none to interrupt us; speak. Ph. But my seal'd lips cannot the silence break. Both urg'd to speech, and forced to be still. I call you Gods to witness that my will. Hip. Can you not speak your mind. Nu. Great griefs are best By silence, little ones by words exprest. Hip. Mother give me the burthen of your cares. Ph. The name of Mother to much distance bears. An Humbler name becomes our Love. Call us Thy sister, or thy maid, Hippolitus. But rather maid. I the most slavish yoke Will wear. Command it shall be undertook. Ile clime the frozen Pindus through deep snows Run through the fire, and armed troops; expose My naked brest to naked swords, receive This Scepter then, and let me be thy slave. To rule becommeth thee, me to obey. It ill becomes a womans arm to sway So great a Nation, thou who 'rt in the pride Of blooming youth, thy Fathers people guide. Protect thy suppliant in thy bosome hid. Take pitty on a widdow. Hip. Heaven forbid: Madam my Father will come safely back: Ph. From Styx, and those insatiate realms no track Doth lead to the forsaken light, shall he Who came a ravisher, dismisled be? 'Lesse Plut'ol sit down a tame Cuckold too. Hip. Heavens far more equall power this will doe. But while it yet rests in suspence, Ile please My Brethren with all fitting offices Protect Thee, that thou seem not widdowed: I The absence of my Father, will supply. Ph. O credulous Lovers! O deceitfull Love! Hath he not said enough? now prayers shall move. O pitty; hear even my silence wooe. I would, yet would not speak. Hip. What ailest thou? Ph. That which thou little thinks a step-dame should Hip. Speak plainly and thy doubtful words unfold. Ph. Why Love within my raging bosome fumes, And with a cruel fire my reins consumes. The flame which in my bowels hid remains Thence shooteth up and down my melting veins, As agile fire over dry timber spread. Hip. What with chast love of Theseus thou art mad? Ph. Thou art in the right: I love that ancient face Which Theseus had when he a stripling was; When first the down budding upon his chin He saw the house the Minotaur was in, And crooked mazes the long thred up wound. How glorious then? his hair with fillets bound, A dainty blush over his cheek was spread, And his soft arms were the securest bed. Like thy Diana, or my PhÅbus then; Or rather thee: thus, thus he looked, when He pleas'd his foe; thus loftily did bear His head, but thou art something hansomer; Thou'st all thy fathers parts; and yet against Reason some of thy Mothers too retain'st, A Scythian rigour in a GrÃ¦cian face; Had'st thou come with thy Father in those dayes, Then Ariadnes clew had sure been thine, Thou, thou my Sister, wheresoere thou shine In spangled skies, a cause so like thine own Assist; one family hath both undone, The Father thee, and me the Son, thou sees A suppliant Princes fallen on her knees; Free from aspersions, innocently good; Chang'd but to thee; I'm sure none else have woo'd This day to grief, or life an end shall bring, Pitty a Lover. Hip. Thou Almighty King Of Gods canst thou so mildly see, so mildly hear Her wickednes? if now the Heavens be clear, When wilt thou thunder? let the troubled air Now run on heaps, and day a Vizard wear. May the reversed Stars now backwards run. And what dost thou, thou the irradiate Sun Behold thy Grandchilds lusts? for shame lay by Thy beams, and into utter darkness fly. And why art thou idle Spectator turn'd Great Jove, the world not yet with lightning burn'd, Thunder at me; let thy quick flame consume Me, I am wicked, and deserve the doom. I've pleas'd my Step-dame, merit I to be Incestuous thought? for this Impiety. Seem'd I most fit? deserves my strictness this? O Women excellent in wickedness! O thou in thy unbounded lusts more wild Than was thy Mother! Shee only defil'd Her self, yet was the wicked theft betray'd By the Prodigious issue which shee had; The doubtfull birth witness'd his Mothers shame With his fierce look, from the same womb thou came Thrice happy are they in their prosp'rous fate Who are by fraud consum'd, destroid by hate; Father I envie thee: this sin, this sin, Is greater then Medeas could have been. Ph. I know our houses Fate; I crave, I know What is forbid, but cannot help it tho, Thee thorough flames, o're rocks; the foaming deep, And heady torrents company I'le keep. Where ere thou goes, there frantick I will be, Behold coy youth, again I kneel to thee. Hi. Keep of, and touch not my chast lims, what now Immodest wretch, wilt thou imbrace me too? Then shall my sword due vengeance take; my hand Wreath'd in her hair, her shameless neck doth bend. Bow-bearing Goddess, never bloud with more Justice was on thy Altars spilt before. Ph. Why now Hippolitus, I have my wish: Thou curst my frenzy; 'bove my hope was this, To perish by thy hand, and chast. Hip. Avaunt, And live; least any thing to thee I graunt, Nor shall this steel, by thee polluted, ere Defile my chaster side by hanging there. What Tanais, what MÃ¦otis, which doth pay His waters tribute to the Pontick sea Can wash me clean? not all great Neptunes flouds Can expiate this crime. O Beasts! O Woods! Nu. Why so dull sulled? now the crime is known Let us plead force and uncompelled own The impious act. Sin is best hid by sinn, Who fear to be accused, should begin. Whether the lewd attempt were ours or his, Since secret, who shall be his witnesses? Help, help, Athenians servants; the obscene Hippolitus is ravishing the Queen; Her with his naked sword he threatneth, And awes her chastity with fear of death. See now he flyes, and by his fearfull speed Hath left his sword, a witness of the deed. First chear the Queen, but let her hair still be Thus torne, and thus disordered as you see. These pregnant testimonies of an act So vile, bear to the City; recollect Your senses; Madam, Why, alas, do you, Afflict your self, and fly the publike view? No Woman ever was from the event Esteem'd immodest, but from the assent. Exeunt. CHORUS. Swift as a tempest doth he fly so fast Cloud-gathering Chorus doth not make such hast A shooting Meteor doth more slowly stream, When rapid winds fan the extended flame. Now may admiring Fame conferr on thee The honour due to all antiquity: For so thy beauty doth all others passe, As PhÅbe seemeth fairer then she was, When at the full shee doth her fire combine With meeting horns, and all the night doth shine Blushing she rises, and the lesser starres Doe lose themselves in that great light of hers. The evening star appeareth not more bright When first he ushers in the sable night, Now Hesperus when rising from the main, But in the morning Lucifer again. Nor thou Bacchus for ever young, thy hair Unshorn, and vines wreathed about thy spear, With which thou dost thy sluggish Tigres wound, Thy horned temples with a Mitre bound, Dost his untrimmed locks excell; nor set Thy beauty (Theseus) on too high a rate, Because the rumour generally goes, That PhÃ¦dra's sister thee 'fore Bacchus chose. Beauty thou most uncertain good, the gay And fading treasure of a short-liv'd day With winged feet how dost thou post away! The scorching heat of summer hath not kil'd So soon, the verdant glory of the field; Ith' middle of the Solstice, when the night Contracts her self, and makes more room for light: As these fair colours that adorn the face Are in a moment gone; no day doth passe But may the ruines of some beauty boast, Form is a fading thing. O! who would trust So frail a good? use it while thou hast power, For time doth steal away, and every houre, Is worse than that which went before, Why lov'st thou deserts? beauty is I'm sure In those untrodden paths, as unsecure If hid from mid dayes heat in woods thou be Loose rings of Naiades will compass thee, Who choicest youths imprison in their streams: And wanton Silvans shall ensnare thy dreams. Or if the Moon thought younger than the old Arcadians from her Starry Orbe behold That she with wonder will be fixed there. Of late she blush'd, nor any clouds appear To vail her naked Lustre, but we grown Sollicitous for th' colour she was on, Our kettles beat against Thessalian spells When besides thee, she had no leasure else; Thou wert her only cause of stay, and shee But stopt her chariot while shee look'd on thee. Let fewer frosts but nip thee, and the rayes Of PhÅbus seldomer salute thy face, It will excell the Parian Marble, how That pleasing frown becomes thy manly brow! How grave a Majesty is seated there! Although thy neck might with the Suns compare His flowing tresses on his shoulders spread With which hee's both adorn'd and covered: That rugged front, becoming thee, and those Short curles, which only Nature doth compose Though the most warlike Gods thou mightst defie And from the combate bear the Victory: Though now, while yet a youth thou equallest, Alcides brawnie arms, or Mars his chest. If when thou ridest, Castor never rein'd His Cyllarus with such an even hand. If when thy finger to the loop made fast, With all thy force thou dost thy javelin cast; The Cretans cannot shoot so far, who be Esteemed Masters in Artillery, Or Parthian like, direct thy shafts on high And none return unblouded from the skie; But in her bowels fixt, doe make the bird Thy prey which in the middle region sor'd. Yet (search all ages records for their fate) The fair have seldome proved fortunate. Some milder God protect thee, and may thou Live till thou be deform'd, so aged too. What dare not vexed women do? what snares Shee to entrap the guiltless youth prepares, Her cheeks she doth bedew; her head undresses, And seeks beleef, in her disordered tresses. All guil is com'd by woman, but who's he, That in his face such marks of Majesty Doth bear; his head erected with that state? How like Hippolitus he is! but that His cheeks do such a ghastly paleness wear, And such a filth doth clot his flagging hair. See Theseus self return'd to Earth is there. Finis Actus Secundi.</field>

At length returned from nights gloomy coasts And th' Pole which shaddows the imprisond ghosts How light offends mine eies; now is the corn Triptolemusses gift, the fourth time shorn; Four Ãquinoctials now hath Libra seen; While I uncertain of my Fate have been, Betwixt the Ills of life and death divided. I Retain'd this part of life, when I did lye Buried my sence remaind. Great Hercules Dragging the dog from hell did finish these Miseries, and brought me thence, but now it wants The prop of strength, my tired courage faints.

Speak some one: In my gates, complaints, and tears, And sorrow in variety exprest? Indeed fit welcomes for a hellish guest. Nu. PhÃ¦dra resolves to dye; she doth despise, Our bootless tears, and even now shee dies. Th. What cause of death? why die? now I am come? Nu. Ev'n that doth hasten her untimely doom. Th. Thy doubtful speech some great thing doth presage Speak plainly, whence proceeds so wild a rage? Nu. In her own bosome she concealeth that, To dye determin'd, none must know for what; Forward, good Sir, forward, the business might Crave your best speed. Th. Open the door there straight. Scena Secunda. Theseus. PhÃ¦dra. Nurse. Servants. O partner of my bed, dost thou receive Me thus? This all the welcome I must have; Lay by this sword; restore my troubled sence, And say, what fury doth perswade thee hence. Ph. Alas great Theseus, by thy Scepter, by The toward hopes of thy Posterity, By thy return, and me now dost permit Me here to die. The. What cause requireth it? Ph. The benefit were lost the cause once known. The. Why none shall hear it but my self alone. Dost thou mistrust thy Husband? never fear My brest will prove a faithful Treasurer. Ph. Conceal thou first, what thou wouldst have conceal'd The. Yet shall all means of dying be withheld From thee. Ph. The willing can't want means. The. Relate, What crime thou with thy death wouldst expiate. Ph. Why that I live. The. Cannot my tears prevail? Ph. That death is welcomest which friends bewail. The. Well she is obstinate; but I will force What she conceals with torments from the Nurse. Load her with ir'ns, stripes shall make her betray What ere she knows. Ph. Now I will tell you, stay. The. Why dost thou turn away thy face, and seek To hide the tears, which trickle down thy cheek? Ph. Thee, thee, Father of gods, and thee from whom Our hours first Originall did come, Dayes brightest Lampe, I call to witness how I neither to his prayers, nor threats did bow, And yet my body did his force sustain, But with my bloud, Ile wash it clean again. The. Say who hath been the ruine of our fame? Ph. One whom thou little thinks. The. Tell me his name, Ph. This sword will tell you, which he left, afeard To be attach'd by the alarum'd guard, The. Oh me! what crimes, what monstrous crimes doe I Behold? rough with the little Imagerie, The Iv'ry hilt with those Illustrious signs, Which glorifie th' Actean Nation shines, But how escaped he? Ph. Why these can say, With what a fearfull speed he fled away. Scena Tertia. Theseus. The. Oh sacred Piety! O King of Gods, And thou who rul'st the second Lot, the floods What rage possest this impious brat? did Greece, Taurus or Colchian Phasis teach him this? His deeds declare his line, and he hath shew'd Whence he first sprung by his degenerate bloud. Those mad Viragos marriage do despise, And weary of their long kept Chastities Turn Prostitutes at last. O cursed root, Which when transplanted bears no better fruit! Yet even they flie Incest; an innate Shame doth keep Natures laws unviolate. Now where's his feign'd austerity, desire To imitate the ancients rude attire, Strictness of manners, gravitie of look? O jugling life, how art thou still mistook? The foulest soul wears the serenest face. The Impudent doth blush, Strife seems at Peace, Sin wears the robes of Piety, Deceit Applaudeth truth, and the effeminate A rigid abstinence doe counterfeit. Thou the fierce Virgin Sylvan wert thou then Reserv'd for this? must thy sins write thee man? And in thy Fathers bed? now on my knees I humbly thanke the carefull Deities That I did kill Antiope: least thou Had'st in my absence forc'd thy Mother too. Fly vagabond to unknown Realms, although Thou to the worlds remotest countries goe, Sever'd from Earth by interposing seas; Or shouldst thou dwell in the Antipodes, Or hide thy self in the obscurest hole, Beyond the Kingdoms of the Northern Pole; The seat of snow and winter left behind, And the cold blasts of that loud-threatning wind; Yet, yet the sword of vengeance should thee find. I will pursue thee every where, search places Remote, Landlock'd, abstuce, confounding mazes, And wayes inexplicable; and where force Cannot arrive, Ile reach thee with a curse. Dost thou know whence I came? great Neptune gave Me Pow'r three times to ask what I would have, And seald his promise by the Stygian floud, Behold how sorrowfull a boon I wou'd. No more let him behold the light, but goe From his wrong'd Father to the Ghosts below. To me thy Son a hated pitty show. This last gift never had bin ask'd, if I Were not oppress'd by such an injury. When in the womb of Hel, where Dis did roar, And threatning Pluto stormed, I forbore. Make good thy promise now, why dost thou stay? Why hast thou still so undisturb'd a Sea? With wind-contracted clouds, put out the light Of Stars, obscure the Heav'ns, and masque the night; Pour out thy Seas, drive all thy Monsters hither, Call from the Deep the waves retired thither. Exit. CHORUS. O Nature Mother to the Gods and Jove Who sway'st the bright Olympus, who doest move The Stars scatterd in their swift Orbe, and force Ev'n those wand'rers to observe a course, And on their hinges turnst the Poles; Why art Thou alwaies busied in the heavenly part? Still ord'ring those Celestiall Forms? why dost Thou take such care that now the winters frost Sould strip the woods, and then again t' adorn, Them with fresh shades; that now the parched corn The rage of the hot Lion should endure, Which the more temp'rate Autume doth mature? But why hast thou, who these dost regulate, And mov'st the Sphears poys'd with their proper weight So little care of man: nor dost provide That good the good, and ill the ill betide. Mortals doe follow the blind-guide of chance Whose hoodwinkt bounty doth the worst advance. The holy perish in the crafty toils Of lust: The Court is governed by wiles. The people love to give the wicked pow'r, And as soon hate whom they doe now adore. Dejected vertue reapeth but a small Reward for doing well; the chaste doe fall Under the curse of want: while potent vice Is crowned for his fam'd Adulteries. Vain Modesty: and empty Fame!âbut stay, What doth the breathless Nuncius hast to say, And sadly stopping, what sinister Chance Figures he in his wofull Countenance? Finis Actus Tertii.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quarti. Scena Prima. Nuncius. Theseus. Nun. O the sad Fate of Servants! Why am I The messenger of our calamitie. Th. Speak thy news boldly; custom thou shalt find For all afflictions hath prepard my mind. Nun. My tongue refuses the sad office. The. Say, What fresh Mis-fortunes our declining house oppress? Nun. Ah me, your Son is dead. The. I wept, my Son Long since: now but a ravsher is gone. But speak the manner. Nun. Why as he forsook The City, painting hatred in his look, Away he flieth with redoubled speed, And quickly harnesses his lofty Steeds, Their mettal'd heat, he with the curb allayes, And divers things unto himself he sayes; Curses your throne, oft on your name doth call And fiercely shakes his slackned reins withall; When suddenly the Sea did roar and swell Up to the Stars; not any breathing gale Did crispe the flouds; no thunder tore the air, The Sea it self raised a tempest there. Sicilian Seas are with the South-wind lesse Disturb'd, nor half that fury doe express When Chorus rains, stones tumbling up and down And with white spume doth high Leucates crown. A hill of waves big with a Monster fled Unto the shore to be delivered. Nor is this tempest for the ships prepar'd But for the land, the Sea rolls thitherward With a main speed; nor can we guesse what she Should labour with; what uncouth Prodigie Earth would shew Heaven, a new Cyclas did Rise, Esculapius Temple now was hid, And the famd rocks of Scyron, and with these The land, straightned betwixt two neigh'bring Seas. While these amaz'd we seek, behold the Main Doth roar, and all the rocks resound again; Whose tops are sprinkled with the waves, which he Sucks in, and spouteth forth Vicissively. So through the Ocean as the whirlpool roams A globe of water from his nostrils comes. Anon this mountain bursts, and to the shore Brings something worse, than was our fear before, The Sea doth follow where the Monster lead, And overwhelms the land, we shook with dread. The. What was the shape of this prodigious beast? Nun. He like a Bul erects his seagreen crest, And virid front: tosses his mane, his ears Pricks up, and party-coloured horns he bears: Such as might both the conduct of the herd Become, and the Seas Issues he appear'd: His eies do sparkle, and he vomits flame: His neck curl'd like the Ocean whence he came, His open nostrils snort aloud: his chest And deawlap in tenacious Moss are drest: His ample sides with red are spotted, then Ends in a Monster; his huge slimie train Drag'd after him, in farthest Seas those Whales Have such which swallow up the obvious sails. Earth trembles with the load: astonish'd fly The scatter'd cattle, nor are followed by Th' affrighted Pastor, beasts the forrest clear; And all the Huntsmen are half dead with fear. Only Hippolitus unmov'd remains, And his amazed Steeds with straighter reins, Encourag'd by his wel-known voice retains. Tow'rds Argos lyes a steep and craggy way, Which all the neighb'ring Ocean doth survey: Here this vast bulk doth whet himself, and act In jest first, what he doth intend in fact. But when he felt his rage increase, and had Now long enough with his own fury plaid; Away he flies, scarce any print remains, And just before the trembling chariot stands. Your Son nere changeth colour, but doth rise With angry looks, and thus aloud he cries; I shall not easily be afraid of this; To conquer Bulls hereditary is. But straight his disobedient Steeds, their load Did carry thence, and having mist the road They follow'd as their fury lead, and ore Uneven rocks the jolting Chariot bore. He, as a skilfull Pilot taketh care In a rough Sea to keep his Vessell fair, And with his art beguiles the waves; doth guide His horses, now he draws their mouths aside With the strain'd bit, and now the scourge he uses; Nor all the way his foul companion loses: Now side by side, he keeps an equall pace: Now right before; and terror brings each wayes. But here the flight doth end; just in the way Standeth the horned Monster of the Sea. Th' affrighted Steeds then lost all rule, and strove To run down headlong from the rocks above; Rising before they cast your Son, who, as He fell, within the reins entangled was, Which wound about his body, and the more He struggled held him faster then before. They with the empty Chariot run, this known As their fear guides; commanded now by none So feeling a strange weight, and scorning that Day was committed to a counterfeit, Hurried through the air, the Chariot of the Sun Shook from his seat the unskilfull Phaeton His blood besmears the fields: his head the rocks Doth beat, and Brambles tear away his locks; Sharp stones dis-figure his fair face, and by Whole troops of wounds, his hapless form destroy. The swift wheels drag, his dying limbs at last His corps on an erected stake is fast. Struck through the middle of his groin, a while He staid his chariot fixed on a pile; His steeds made a short halt, but quickly they At once both broke their Master, and delay. Then briers and thorns his half-dead body tear, And evr'y bush, a piece of him doth weare. His wofull servants are disper'st to find, Where his bloud marks the way, he thus dis-joynd Hippolitus; the howling Beagles goe In guest of their dissever'd Master too. Nor all their diligence as yet compleats, The Corps, is this the honour beautie gets? Who now, Partner, and heir unto a Crown, As bright as any Constellation shone; Is gather'd to his Urn in peeces now O Nature, but too prevalent art thou. What tyes of bloud dost thou on Parents lay, Which we, even against our wills, obey! Whom dead I wish'd, now dead I weep for, Nun. None. Enough can weep, for what themselves have done. The. Mortals abide no greater curse, than when Constrain'd to wish what they unwish agen. Nun. Why do you weep, if you retain your hate? The. Not that he's dead, but that I caus'd his fate. Exeunt. CHORUS. How fickle is the state of man! the poor Doe not the fiercest storms of chance endure; She strikes them with her lightest stroaks, they be Crownd with content though in obscuritie; A homely cottage doth the eyelids close With a secure and undisturb'd repose. Those lofty towers neer neighbours to the skie Receive the East and South-winds battery; The rage of the tempestuous Boreas, and The showr-accommpanied Chorus stand. The humble valley is but rarely strook With thunder, when great Caucasus hath shook And Ida trembled. Jove himself afraid Of the seal'd heavens, hath earth his refuge made. Plain homely roofs, and vulgar habitations Have no extraordinary alterations, When Kingdoms totter, on their craz'd foundations Fortune doth flie with an uncertain wing, And none can boast he hath her in a string. He who redeemed from eternall night Again enjoyes the comfort of the light, Now weepeth his return from Hell, and here Meeteth a greater cause of grief than there. Pallas, whom we to reverence are bound That Theseus free'd from the Stygian sound Again reveiws the Heav'ns; chaste Virgin thou Art not beholding to thy Uncle now: The greedy Tyrant hath his number still. What voice of weepings this? what bloody Scene With a drawn sword prepares the frantick Queen. Finis Actus Quinti.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Theseus, PhÃ¦dra, Chorus, Servants. Th. What fury doth possess thee? why this sword Wherefore about a body so abhor'd Are these complaints and tears? Ph. On me, on me Pour forth thy wrath hard-hearted Deitie; On me let loose thy Monsters, whatsoere Tethys doth in her hidden bosome bear: Whatever do in farthest Seas remain Embrac'd by the unstable Ocean. Oh Theseus ever fatall to thine own! Now thy returne thy Father, and thy Son, Have purchas'd with their lives; still thou thy house Destroy'st with Love or hatred of thy Spouse; Oh my Hippolitus, and doe I view Thee thus? and must I be the Author too? What Scinis, what Procrustes, what new kind Oh double-visag'd Cretan bulls, confin'd Unto DÃ¦dalian Labyrinths, scattered Thy limbs? Oh! whither is thy beauty fled? Whither those eyes my stars! what, dead? Oh stay, A while, and hear me what I have to say. My language shall be chast; this sword shall thee Into my bosome stab'd, revenge of me, And death shall make me be PhÃ¦dra no more, As my impiety did once before; Then will I follow thee through all the streams Of Hel, through Styx, and channels fil'd with flams, Let me appease thy Ghost, here take this hair, Which thus from the disordered fleece I tear. Though in our wills unequall, we may try An equall fate; if chaste, to Theseus dye: If not, unto thy love; what shall I climbe My Husbands bed defil'd by such a crime? Or was this sin undone, only that I, The abused Vindicator should enjoy Of an unviolated Chastity? O Death, the only cure of Love, who best A broken Modesty recementest To thee I fly: open thy quiet brest. Athenians hear, and thou a Father worse Than I a Stepdame, what I did rehearse Was false and wicked; forg'd in my distracted Bosome: thou'st punished; a sinne unacted. By my incesluous guilt, guiltlesse and chast He fel, now thy deserved praise thou hast. This sword shall pierce my impious brest, and bring My bloud to thy wrong'd Ghost an offering. What thou shouldst doe now thou hast lost thy son, Learn of a Step-dame: Flie to Acheron. The. You dark jaws of Avernus, and you caves Of Tenarus, with you forgetfull waves Of Lethe, gratefull to the wretched, you Dull lakes assist to overwhelm me too; Load me with everlasting plagues, come now You monsters of the deep; whatever thou, Proteus hast hidden in the utmost wombe Of the Ocean, and ev'n that Ocean come, And me glory'ng in such a crime convey To the dark bosome of the profound sea, And thou too prone a Father to my wrath, Now I deserve to dye, by a strange death; I have dispers'd my Son, and while afraid To leave a false offence unpunished, Acted a true; what fourth lot can I try? Heaven, Hell, the sea by my Impietie Are fill'd, already in each portion known Am I: Was my returne for this alone? The way to light unstopt to shew me these Sad and ingeminated obsequies? Widdow'd and childles I that might at once Kindle two fun'rall piles, my wives and sons? O thou to whom this dismal light I ow, Return me back unto those shades below. But, Impious, I doe now in vaine preferre Forsaken death; cruell Artificer, Who findest out new waies of bloud, and death, Now finde a curse thy sin which equalleth. Pines humbled to the earth by force, at their Release, my body shall in peeces teare, Or I will jump from Scyrons rocks. I've seen Worse judgements, what their sufferings have been Girt with a mote of fire. I know what paines, And future mansion for my self remaines. Make roome you sinfull Ghosts; thy endlesse toile Upon these shoulders lay, and rest the while Faint Sicyphus: let that false river slip, When almost caught from this deluded lip. Let Tityus vulture leave him, and for food Prey on my Liver still, to paine renew'd. Rest my Pirithons Father, while I, bound Unto thy Wheele, keep the perpetuall round. Gape Earth, receive me Hell, receive me: this A juster voyage for me thither is; My Son I follow: fear not thou, who sway'st That Ghostly Empire; my intent is chast. In thy Ãternall house receive me then, Now never to escape from thence agen. The Gods are not so much as mov'd with prayer; But when I aske a crime, how quick they are! Cho. Now pay the rites of fun'rall, and mourne, These limbes you see so misrably torne; You will have time enough to weep. The. O bear Hither those reliques I esteeme so deare. Give me that burthen, and those limbs, but too Irreverently gathered by you. Art thou Hippolitus? thou art, the deed I doe confess, and I thy Parricide, Least I should sin but once, and that alone, Did call my Father when I slew my Son. See his Paternall Legacy. O rage Which thus unproppest my declining age! Let me embrace these limbs, and what is yet Remaining in my bosome cherish it; Joyn these dissected members and digest Those parts in order which be thus displac'd, Here put his right hand, here his left, once skill'd In moderating of those reins it held. This mark in his left-side, I know how great A part have I to weep unfound as yet. Hold out my trembling hands, and you restrain My thirsty cheeks your ample showrs of rain, While to my Son I count his limbes, and mold His body new. This peece no shape doth hold At all, with wounds so mangled 'tis unknown What part it is, but sure I am 'tis one. Here in this void, although not proper place It shall be laid: Is this that Heavenly face Humbled a Stepdames pride? that Beauty come To this? O Gods how cruell is your doom! Oh bloody fury! to thy Father thus Com'st thou, and by my wish Hippolitus? Here take my Sires last gift that I should bear Thee oft; mean while wee'l burn these members here Open the morning Court, and with loud cryes Let all the Town the fun'rall solemnize. Look you to th'Royall Pile; search you about The Fields to find what yet is wanting out, Give her the buriall of a ditch, where laid, May earth lye heavie on her Impious head. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
