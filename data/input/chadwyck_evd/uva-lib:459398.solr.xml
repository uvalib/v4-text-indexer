      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDIE OF LODOVICK SFORZA DVKE OF MILLAN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EXPLANATION of the Frontispice. It was when Industry did sleepe The Wolfe was Tutor to the Sheep, And to amaze a plainer man, The thiefe was made the guardian. But can a Wolfe forget to prey? Can Night be lightned into Day? Without respect of lawes or blood, His charge he makes to be his food. With that triumphant he sits downe, Opprest, not honour'd with a Crowne, And on the lesser beasts does try A most Authenticke Tyranny: This the French Lyon heares, and when He's thought fast sleeping in his denne, Vengeance and He at once doe wake, And on the Wolfe their fury slake. Bad acts may bloome sometimes, but n'ere grow high, Nor doe they liue so sure, as they shall dye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS MOST WORTHIE FRIEND Mr. FRANCIS HIDE PROCTOR OF OXFORD.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument. Lodovicke Sforza, after hee had cunningly supplanted the Duchesse from the wardship of her sonne Galeazzo, as cunningly practizeth to bee the murtherer of him, of whom he would seeme to be the Protector. To this end he was to remoue this impediment. Isabella daughter to the Prince of Calabria, and Grand-childe vnto Ferdinand King of Naples, was wife to Galeazzo. A woman of a spirit as high as her birth, and equall to Sforza in all things but the sex: shee perceiuing the stupidity of her husband, and how that whatsoeuer she proiected for his safety, he discouered to his vncle, for his ouerthrow, makes her father secretly acquainted with all the passages, desiring him to vindicate his son in law from the vsurpation of his Protector. This could not be so priuately dispatched, but that Sforza had an incling of it, whether out of his owne reach hee guessed it: or by his Nephewes sottishnesse he vnderstood it. To preuent then his owne ruine, whilst he intends his Nephews, he ventures on those remedies which the height of feare rather rusheth on, then chuseth, which more expresse and exchange, then remoue, or auoyd a danger. He knew the French claime to Naples, to the prosecution of which he sollicites the yong King; whom either his right, or inconsideratenesse quickly armes vnto the action. But before his comming, hee by continuall messengers deludes the old King, and makes him beleeue that there was no purpose of his comming, and that the French iourney vnto Naples, as it was onely the childe of rumor, &amp; had no being but fr? fame, so in a very short space, in the age of a wonder it would vanish and expire. Thus was Ferdinand perswaded from his necessary defence, till hauing certainly vnderstood that all defence would be too late, the French being already very strong vpon his frontires, cheated, not conquer'd, hee dyes and leaues his sonne Alphonso heire of his kingdome, and his troubles. The French King being now entred in person into Italy, Galeazzo dyes of a poyson at Pauia, when Sforza has brought this worse poyson into his Country. But the French growing prodigiously victorious, and almost by the very seeing ouercomming their opposites, Sforza begins to be apprehensiue of his owne danger, and striues to rid himselfe of these incumbrances, in the which a too much prouidence had intangled him. A consideration without doubt necessary, but almost past the season, it being neer vnto an impossibility to expell him now, whom it was far from any difficulty at the first not to admit. So that this second resolution did onely proclaime the folly of the first, which either in wisdome hee should not haue ventur'd on, or, in honesty not haue altred. But howsoeuer, hee enters into a new league with the Venetians, and giues the French after their victorious returne from Naples halfe an ouerthrow at Taro. And now when hee thinks himselfe confirm'd in his Dukedome, when he as little fear'd ruine, as he deseru'd preseruation; the French King dyes suddenly, to whom Lewis, the true Duke of Orleans, and titular Duke of Millan, succeeded, with him Sforzaes late friend, the Venetians conclude a league. Thus Sforza being left alone, raiseth two armies vnder the conduct of the two Sanseuerins, men, whom hee had highly fauour'd and aduanced. But it is scarce seene, that a faithlesse Master should haue a trusty seruant, and hee that hath no respect to his owne word, shall in the extremest of his necessities, finde all others promises but words. The elder reuolts, and the yonger, without the least show of resistance, flyes, and Sforza himselfe is so closely pursued, that he can scarce get away safe into Germany. The French abusing their late victory, the Millanesi with a generall consent, recall Sforza; who, like a melting snow, ouerflowes all before him, and recouers most of his Duchy, with the same easinesse that he had lost it. The strength of his Army consisted especially of Swizzers, whom the late ouerthrow of the warlike Duke of Burgundy, and these Italian wars, had raised to the height of admiration. But to be valiant is not to haue all vertues: these were as strong in treachery, as in battle, they lead Sforza in the habite of a Swizzer into the French camp, through which in the same habit they had promised to conduct him. Thus hauing beene twice betrayd, and now a prisoner, after a ten yeers harsh confining hee dyes in France, hauing liu'd in his misery, longer then in his Duchy, and leauing instruction to succeeding Princes that height should not be their ayme, but integrity; and that they would not (that I may vse the words of our Poet) tempt their starres beyond their light.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Can horror haue an auditory? can Man loue the spectacle of ruin'd man? We fear'd we should haue beene alone, that hence, The Actors should haue beene the Audience. Are you not frighted yet? doe you not rise? Can that inuite, which should dismay your eyes? We shew neer murthers, and in that degree Where Mariage is vnlawfull, then, the free Progresse of crimes, by nimble Iustice met, Ãqually horrid, this we shew, but yet Vnlesse your Courtesie, your Iudgement sway, We suffer a worse torture, then we play.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primi Scena prima. Galeazzo Duke of Millane, Isabella his Wife. Gal. Why weeps my Deare? Isab. Aske why I do not weep: (Poore Isabella are thy teares deny'd thee?) Aske why thus long such a succession Of sorrow clogs my bosome, and does rob So much of Woman from mee, as complaints. Aske why I doe not raue, teare my haire, thus, Create a griefe, which Fate would spare me, then Cloud the sad Ayre with sighes, and at the last, With a bold stab take from insulting Fortune The miserable obiect of her sport: Aske why I doe not this, not, why I weepe. Gal. Or stint thy teares, or mingle them with mine By a relation of their cause: these eyes, Trust me, my Isabella, are not dry, Nor has strong sorrow ere exhausted them, To make them bankrout of a friendly teare, Doe thou but proue it once a friendly teare And not a fond one. Why, my Isabella, Why dost thou hasten those that come too fast, Sorrow, and Age? If it be true, I heard Of Sforza, my deare Sforza, ther's no ioy But either past, or fleeting, and poore man Growes vp but to the experience of Griefe, And then is truly past minority When he is past all happinesse: Jsab. My Lord, My sorrow dares not argue with your loue, This smile expels it. Gal. Be it banisht farre, Ãternally, or to the yeares of Age. I, these vnclouded lookes become my deare, And giue me ioy too. I must hunt to day With my deare vncle: O he is a man That alters all those fond relations, Which Nature giues, whom an vncles name Out loues all ather: I could praise him still, But that I stay too long from him: farewell. Ex. Jsab. O Galeazzo! O not Galeazzo! How has Man fled thee! how thy soule has fled thee! Onely thy lineaments bely a Man. Thou hunt; alas poore Prince, thou art the Game: Thy vncle hunts: and yet he does not neither, But stands a glad, and idle looker on, Whilst thou insnar'st thy selfe, sinfully fool'd, Flattering thy Executioner, and so Dost nor preuent thy misery, nor yet know. Enter Galea. Gal. I am return'd once more, before I'me gone, To see if thy fond griefe be not return'd; What ioy is there in a forbidden griefe? What comfort in the eyes sad flux? once more Is it my fault giues you these teares? Jsab. My faults; For which so strange a sadnesse seizes me, That it increaseth when I striue with it, And makes my face rebellious to my Lord, When my heart yeelds. Gal. Then once againe, adieu, Forsake your griefe, or griefe will forsake you. Exit. Isab. Forsake my griefeâO bid me forsake heau'n, My reason, and mine honor: onely sighes Doc keepe me in opinion of Beeing, And without them I were a stupid coarse. Shall I obey impossibilities? Forsake the sorrow, and retaine the cause? How can I thinke that yet the vntyr'd Sunne Has iourny'd but a twelue-month, since I was In Ferdinando's Court, the Paragon Of happy Naples, when his Palace seem'd Guarded with Princely sutors, and mine eye, Caught with so many rarities of men, Taught me that too much choyce did hinder choyce, That Galeazzo then must cary me? This Galeazzo, neither Prince, nor Man, Fool'd out of both by Sforza, his deare vncle. Can I thinke this, and thinke of ioy againe? Can I thinke this, and dare to thinke againe? Why should some toyes of after-torment fright A resolution of easing me From present ones? O tis the curse of man To be vnhappy at arbitrement, Enter Iulia. Till heau'n please to relent. My Iulia, Breath's Naples any comfort? quickly speake. Iul. None, Madam, and your courteous Grandfather In stead of Armies sends you Patience. Isab. What patience? he should haue sent me rage, Ayded my anger, if not my reuenge: Patience? O God! can griefe be patient? Can Thunder whisper? or chaf'd seas not roare? In me is Sea and thunder, I will be A patterne of Reuenge not misery. Ex. Scena secunda. Sforza. Sforza as yet thou but beginst to act, And yet beginst to stagger: wert thou not A Princes sonne? why art thou not a Prince? Protectors are but subiects, and this staffe But shewes me vnder whose command I am. Is this our hindrance that our mother first Swell'd with another? what her wombe denyde Our head shall giue, or we will loose our head, What was her labour to a Crowne? Perhaps A monster might haue fill'd her first, a thing Of royall prodegy, and should this thing Grow to be hooted to a crowne before vs? Or if that Crownes be due to the most yeares, Why should the Nephew be the Vncles Lord? And Lawes of Nations conquer those of Nature? Nature intended of Sov'raignty to them Of soueraigne vnderstanding; to the rest, How euer aged, but subiection, Which Isabella would detaine vs in: And whilst she trusts to Naples, our sad brow May sooner weare willow, then Diadems. Enter Belgiosa. Return'd so soone, my Belgiosa? thankes, Before I heare thy message, for thy hast. Bel. My Lord, our sudden comming into France, Left fame behind vs, where ariu'd, we crau'd A priuate audience? Sf. But had you it? Did not our enemies sharpe espies descry The depth of our hid counsells? Bel. They might first Desery the subtill path of a swift ship, The voyage of a bullet, or of thought, Before your more mysterious purposes? Sf. Then since we are alone, and in a place Free from the bold intrusion of an eye, Feigne Vs the Prince to whom we sent you forth, And speake our Embassy vnto our selfe. Bel. Grear Prince, to haue the offer of a Crowne Is rare, and your felicity: my Lord, Millans Protector, but your seruant, knowing The ancient right your predecessors had Is vsurpt Naples, by vs wooes your Grace (Consider vnto what he wooes your Grace) Not to maintaine his pow'r, but make your owne, To take a Kingdome that e'ne sighes for you. So shall the infamy of a lost crowne Rot in the earth with your dead Ancestors, And the recouery reuiue their names To waite vpon your triumph with your foes: For so much iustice needs no other power, And yet such is your pow'r, that it is able To make what euer you should fancy, iust: But that your vertue is aboue that pow'r. I will not call you vsurer of Fame, By this large act, when the astonisht world Now fifty Ages off from vs, shall reade Not in the boastings of a painted tombe (The flatteries of great rottennesse) but your name Writ in Ãternities true Characters, For making conquer'd Crownes the iudiments Of your victorious infancy in armes, When France shall know no other Charlemaigne. Sf. But should we faile in the attempt? what then? Belg. Can Heau'n faile Iustice? or those pow'rs commit Sinnes which they punish? O my gracious Lord Sinne not with that weake thought: but if they should, Sforza will neuer: Sf. He is alwaies noble, But hee'l vndoe vs with a benefit, To giue a kingdome is aboue requitall. Belg. His hopes are but the prayse of honest deeds, If in the rereward of your spreading Fame, That fils all mouthes, some happy tongue may glance At him, as a poore engine of your glory, That could impart, but nor possesse a Fame. Sf. Excellent man, if to this welcome speech Thou giu'st as faire an answer. Bel. This in briefe After some scruple, and a little pause He whisper'd he would come. Sf. Exactly done, But leaue vs now, my noble Belgiosa, Till we may study a reward for thee. Ex. Belg. The twilight hastens, when Vitellio And Malatesta one of an high trust Ent. Vitell. &amp; Malat. With our fond Nephew, promised conference. And here they are Is it decreed braue friends? Shall it be swiftly done? nay, tis no matter, Your colour sayes you dare not. Vit. It lyes then: If that my colour shew me disobedient To my good Lord, be I for euer pale: But when shall Galeazzoes wish'd-for death Shew we dare somewhat? Sf. We would gladly haue A poyson teach him linger to his death, And a month hence we shall expect his knell. Ex. Now are we entred, and now to retire Were the worse treason: like an inrag'd fire The more we are oppos'd, the more wee'l spred And make our foes our fewell: to be head Wee'l cut off any member, and condemne Vertue of folly for a Diadem, Banish Religion, and make blood as cheape As when two Armies turn'd into one heape Of carcasses, lye grou ling, what care we For the slight tainture of disloyalty? None will commend the race till it be run, And these are deeds not prais'd till they are done. Scena tertia. Iuliano, Picinino. Iul. My Picinino, holds this sad newes true? Pici. My Iuliano, yes; tis in each voyce That some perswasion flatt'ring Ferdinand, That the French iourney was but a report, Made him reuoke Alphonso, his braue sonne, Who with an Army had indanger'd vs: For the wise old man fearing, a deepe feare Might arme an enemy, else too weake for him, And make vs hasten the French warre, gaue o're His warre with vs: but when he vnderstands That all this quiet does not purchase peace, The coozen'd Prince seekes the sure peace of death, And leaues his ruine to destroy his sonne. Iul. Will the French come? then prethee, Death, come too. Why should our eyes dull'd to all other sights By Age and sorrow, be reseru'd for sight Of warre and sorrow? Ã´ discourteous heau'ns! Why haue you dally'd with vs to white hayres? Why kept till this time, must we perish now? O wherefore are we come so neere the graue And are not in it yet? yet pardon me Good heau'n, your acts are aboue question: Yet I may shed these teares for Italy; Slaue of that world, which once, her valour slau'd, Restoring backe her triumph's with her spoyle, Distracted in herselfe, and onely fit To make a bankrout Poet heale his credit With matter for fresh Tragedies. Pic. Good heau'n! Is this to ease misfortune, or increase it? If Passion could whine out felicity, Or plenteous teares could drowne vnhappinesse, I haue eyes too, and they containe their showres, Nor would I ere be niggard of a Griefe. But teares being onely teares, an easie dew Of childish eyes, and all the rest of Griefe Commanding smiles, more then Compassion, I thanke my Genius I am resolute To laugh at Fortune when she is most angry. Iul. Such laughter may haue little mirth in it, And I shall haue more comfort in a teare. Pic. You may, good Fountaine, yes, droppe on, to see, If so much moysture will reuiue thy cheekes Whilst Ile be yong with laughter. I am he That feares a sorrow, more then misery. Scena quarta. Uitellio. This is the place, and this the time: good heau'n! What an odd place, and what an vncouth time? Had I beene hyr'd to murther Sforza here, Hell could not prompt more fit occasion. I like nor it, nor him: but here he comes. Ent. Sforza. Sf. Welcome Vitellio, thy hast is welcome: Nay complement with him, whom thou wouldst kill, Be free to vs as we doe know thee true. Speak, yet I need not bid thee, for thine eye Sparkles a ioyfull answer. It is done. Vit. Tis done my Lord, and now my Lord, 'tis told (That Galeazzo is no more a man) And with an euen scruple, for to me The act's as easie as relation. Sf. Thou speak'st true manhood: 'tis thy art alone That giues vs certaine honour: there are some Striue for Ãternity with losse of life, At least with hazard of the losse of it, And thinke they are reueng'd when they are kill'd? These are our valiant duellists, and these Doe bleed whilst we doe conquer, heale their wounds, Whilst we receiue none: then, at last, vnfold (Man of deepe Art, that canst preuent the Fates, And cut a thread, which they had thought to spunne Fourty yeares yonger) thy wise mysteries. Thy constant, neuer-failing stratagems, Which cause a death, without a feare of death, Vit. Here are some drugs, but of these some, not one But can command a life where ere it is, And ruinate the strongest workemanship That Heau'n ere brag'd to haue compos'd of Earth. Powders of speedy Fate, but aboue all The instruments, which make me neere to death Of such indear'd familiarity, This glasse has nimblest operation: Whose liquor cast vpon the face of man Straight dulls him to an euerlasting sleepe. Sf. Is this the liquor of Ãternity? Vitellio fals as dead. Then take thy Lethe, and goe sleepe for euer. Enter Malat. Mal. I am deceiu'd, or else this is the place Which Sforza chooseth when he is alone. Yes, this is it. Sf. What Malatesta come? What Deuill brought him hither? O crosse starres! Be sudden, Sforza, now, or thou art lost: He must beleeue our guilt was accident. He falls vpon Uitellio. Speake, my Vitellio O tune thy lips But to one syllable, but to one groane And I am satisfi'd. Mal. What fight is here? Vitellio dead, and Sforza tur'nd a Mourner? Sf. Shouldst thou dye thus, how would my name be soyld? For though I am as guiltlesse of thy death, As Innocence, or if there be a name That hath lesse beeing: yet the enuious world Will quit curst Fortune of so great a crime, And giue it me: yet speake. Mal. I'me bold my Lord, To aske your Honor when dismall chance First frighted Heau'n? Sf. Now, Malatesta, now: When could vnhappinesse raigne so, but now? As if he meant to be before his Lord, He had no sooner told the Prince must dye, But he straight dy'd. Mal. Then courage, my good Lord, Since it is thus, make the best vse of it: For now you need not feare to be reueal'd, When one mouth's stopt, and th'other is your owne. But since your last retyrement, we haue beene Instructed by the speed of frequent Poasts, Of the ariuall of the king of France. Sf. With thankes, a while, my Malatesta, leaue vs. Ex. Why should we longer thinke of other pow'rs, And not bring offrings now to our owne braine? Which giues vs Agents of all kinds of men, And Kings as well as poys'ners: this wise King Must trouble Naples, who would trouble vs, Diuert inuasions which are yet not made, And thus our ends are cheapely brought about, We onely at the charge of plott: they fight, And Galiazzo dyes, whom either King Were they not thus intangled, would preserue: We shall be conquerors without fighting thus, And their poore swords shall cut a way for vs. Surgit Vitellio. I'me for you France. Vit. And I am for you, Sforza, Not poyson'd yet, vnlesse 'twere by thy teares. The other liquor had an Antidote. Happy suspect! had I beene credulous And thought his loue as free as it would seeme I had not beene, distrust has ransom'd me. But Malatesta is intrapp'd, I know Sforza for nothing did not aske the skill: My equall villaine perishes, and I Thus being accessary to his death May sinne to Innocence, by poasting off The Princes fate to him; whilst a disguise Shall keepe aliue the fame that I am dead. And thus halfe truth shall come to light, and I, Be wisely cleer'd by double villany. Ex. Scena quinta. Caiazzo, Sanseuerin, Maluezzo. Sans. As I am noble, 'twas a glorious sight, To see two Princes, in their State at once: As if two Sunnes had harmlesly conspir'd To beautifie, and not to fright the Heau'ns. Why should the formall nicety of State Debarre these often enteruiewes? I thinke They would be medicine against Tyranny: For, when a Prince sees all things vnder him, Heads of eternall nakednesse, and men That make their glory of their seruitude, He thinkes hee's vncontroulable, that none Without a saucy imputation Dares warne him to his duty: but suppose An equall Maiesty should once become His vsuall obiect, one, whose vncheck't blood Runnes full as high as his, then he does learne, That ther's a Common-wealth of Princes too, Not one sole Monarch. Cai. Yet, Sanseuerin, If you obseru'd some clouds obscur'd both Sunnes, For, when they smil'd most freely, and exprest Their neerest friendship by a strict embrace, They lookt iealously, as if they fear'd A closer stab: and then the King tooke leaue With that excesse of hast, that one would thinke (After this eager preparation,) He did intend his iourney to leaue vs, Not to winne Naples. Mal. 'Tis a dangerous time, (And yet I seeme to crosse the truth I speake When I not feare to call't a dangerous time) Sforza is ouer-wise, and so attempts Vpon the confidence of his owne braine (A braine, though wise, yet I may safely say, Within the possibilitie of error) Things, that can onely hap by miracle To any good. Sans. Why, what can happen ill? Feare you a warre? and what's to be fear'd there? Least that a mortall dy, least that the life Due to a knotty gout, or grating stone, Haue a more easie period by the sword. Let them feare warre, who feare to see their gold, Lest that the Sunne should haue a sight with them, Holding so much of Earth, th'are turn'd to it, Who haue no more life then their durty akers, Men, I may say, in the worst part of men. And why like these runne we an idle race Of threescore yeares, and then sneake to a Death? Whilst souldiers master their mortality And dye by men, if that at all they dye. Malvezzo know, when all things sifted are, Peace onely pleaseth them that ne're knew warre.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus secundi Scena prima. Iuliano, Picinino. Iul. Heard you the generall whisp'ring? Pis. No, what ist? Iul. The Duke is ill.â Pic. And doe they whisper that? Iul. Yes: and, they say, he has strange fits. Pic. How strange? Is poyson strange in Italy? why, know, As Princes liue aboue the vulgar, so Their death has a Prerogatiue: meane men May dreame away their time to fourescore yeares, And when their rotten ioynts drop to their dust, Onely some triuiall infirmity, A Palsie, or an Ague beares the blame: But 'tis not State for Princes to be old, And yet they must not be suppos'd to dye By the respectlesse treason of disease, But by some strange vnheard of accident That Fate did neuer dreame of: but no more, You know Vitellio, and the height of grace Sforza has shew'd him, 'tis suspitious When wisedome flatters villany: then come, Let vs be priuate, and discourse some treason. Enter, after solemne Musick, Sforza, Sanseuerin, Caiazzo, and Souldiers: when after some priuate whisp'ring they depart seuerall waies. Iul. But stay, my Picinino, who are here? Pic. O the grand favorite, Sanseuerin, A most full bubble, valiant vanity: That in high termes can sweare downe fortresses, Blow away Armies with a pow'rfull breath, And spoyle the enemy before he sees him: But when he comes to action, lye as still, As in the tale, that lumpish King of Frogs, Which Ioue did giue them in his merriment. Were tilting valour, I ne're knew a man Of larger worth: could he but breake the rankes Of enemies aswell as he does speares, Millan ne're saw a brauer Generall. But there's his brother too. Iul. I, thats the man. Pic. (Tis wonder we can know so much of him) He that can sound the depth of that sly braine Has a large plummet, trust me Iulian, An hundred Lawyers make vp that one head, And scarcely too: quicke Proteus to him, To this Caiazzo was an Ideot, A plaine flat Ideot, I tell thee man, Meander neuer knew so many windings; If, as they say, an Ãmulation Is bred by likenesse, I doe wonder much How Sforza is induc'd to imploy him. Who has more Deuill in him, then himselfe. Iul. But why is this imployment? why these Armes? When all but Naples are our friends, and they Not able now to shew themselues our foes, Ingag'd, and almost lost in the French warre. Pic. Trickes, Iuliano, Statists call them Arts, Not to be fadom'd by a vulgar reach: But though I want the villany to know, Yet I haue so much spleene to laugh at them; And take a comfort in this plainer sense: No subtilty can coozen Prouidence. Scena secunda. Ascanio, Galeazzo, Isabella, Iulia. Asc. How rests the Prince? Isab. O my good Lord, he rests, But 'tis a quiet, such as the Seas haue, When that the winds haue spent their violence, And out of impotence bestow a calme: 'Tis more a death, then slumber, you may see His senses rather weary, then at rest. Asc. Are then his fits so raging? Isab. Nothing else, Should he but wake, youde thinke two Armies met, And stroue together for the loudest shout. Disease has spred herselfe ore all his parts, And onely spar'd his tongue, as if some starre Not knowing otherwise to cleare it selfe From imputation of tyranny, For such exact plaguing of Innocence Had left him that to curse withall, that so To all that heard his fury, he might seeme To be thus tortur'd for his Blasphemy. Gal. Water, some water. Isab. Now the fit beginnes: Gal. Some of my slaues runne, and exhaust the Po, Charge him no more to vent his idle streames Into the glutted maine, but rather poure All his moyst mouths on me: d'yee stare, begone, Vse not your eyes at all, vnlesse to weepe: And that, not teares of sorrow, but of helpe, Such as may coole me. Asc. Patience, sweet Prince, Adde not vnto the fire of your disease, The heat of passion. Gal. What red thing is this? Ha, Isabella, tell me. Is. 'Tis your vncle. The noble Prince Ascanio. Gal. 'Tis false; He is nor Prince, nor noble: hearke you friends, He talkes of Passion, and of Patience, Let him discourse of Ãtna, or Vesuuius, Or of a greater heat then I doe feele, And I will answer him: Patience to me? Goe bid rough seas be patient. Asc. He growes worse, And opposition does inflame him more: Me thinkes I see his eye-lids faintly striue, Against Deaths closing. Gal. O! my ioynts are fire, Why does not heau'n shed Cataracts, and lowre Once to my comfort? are they hot as I, Haue they no moysture, for a Suppliant? Then, though hot heau'n oppose, when once my breath Hath left this corps, Ile haue a cold by death. Morit. Is. Heard you that grone my LordâÃ´ he is dead: Cracke then ye tardy heart strings, quickly cracke, And giue me leaue to ouer-take the flight Of my dead husband. Asc. What is past our helpe, Let it be past our griefe: tis fortitude To suffer chances counterbuffes as one That by his expectation had deceiu'd All her faint threatnings: till this sadder time Your life has had one constant scene of ioy, Which here is interrupted: you should thanke The heau'ns because they were not tedious In their delights: for this variety. As hunger prayseth feasts, so it may be Youle loue ioy better for this misery. Scena tertia. Sforza, Beatrice. Sf. How couetous thou art to learne mishap? Beatrice the answer kills thee. Bet. Kill me then, But not deny me. Sf. Dearest, I am lost, And in my ruine, thou. Bet. I would be so, Safety were ruine were it otherwise. Yet tell me Sforza, how are you so lost? Sf. O what a busie torture woman is! I must say somewhat, but the maine is silence, Vitellioes losse, yes, that hath lost me too: No sooner kill'd then lost, so strangely gone, As if the dead had learnt a motion So to conuey themselues vnto the graue. Bet. Will you be still vnkind? Sf. Thou shalt heare all. The French haue conquer'd Naples, and which drawes Blood from our soule, without a drop of blood: When thus we plotted it, that when both Kings Had wearied out themselues with equall slaughter, And here Alphonso totter'd, and there Charles; When losse had ceiz'd the conqueror, then we Would haue amaz'd the conqueror afresh With new alarmes: when by the flattery Of chance, France gets a kingdome without blood, And by dry victory has vndone a plot Worth many Kingdomes: I presum'd on this, Naples had souldiers enough to last Killing a yeare, in which space, we resolu'd To arme all Italy against the French, And cunningly driue out, whom we call'd in: Which, ere we could accomplish, is disclos'd, And conqu'ring France intends to hinder it, By our inuasion: Ã´ my policy! Must I be wounded with the sword I gaue? And find those enemies, whom onely I Enabled to my iniury? well; heau'n, Your kindnesse is a miracle sometime, Beyond all reason, but your curse is wit, Enter Ascan. My fault is my faults punisher. Asc. Long life, And happy to our Duke. Sf. How my Ascanio? Recall thy selfe, good Cardinall, what Duke? Whilst Galeazzo liues? Asc. Most truly Duke, For Galeazzo's dead. Sf. Alas, poore child, I could haue wish'd thee longer life, but since Heau'ns will is otherwise, twere blasphemy To storme at that which is the will of heau'n. I hate that impotent rebellion. Enter Sanseu. Sans. My Lord, so crosse was Fortune, that you were Made almost banqu'rout by a too much thrift: For when you had discharg'd those numerous troopes, Whose charges lay as hard vpon the State As an inuasion could, then Orleance mou'd And stole Nouarra, which disastrous newes So heated the remainder of your troopes (As if you had added to their valour more, Whan you abated from their multitudes) That by a nimble victory, they made His conquest be his prison. Sf. Noble friend Stand thou, and our State stands: Ã´ why doe men Cry out on Age, on eating Age? as though Our many griefes were from our many yeares, And the last times were worst: we rather find That nothing is so dangerous to Kings As a yong Principality: for tis With them almost as with yong plants, which yeeld Vnto the least intreaty of the wind, And need no stronger blast, but gaining Age Scarce stoope to thunder: may we once arise Vnto this happy firmenesse of estate, This blest maturity of Prince, we stand Fearlesse of fall, but if heauen enuy vs And haue decreed our ruine with our rising, Yet such weele haue it voyde of all base feares Our foes shall grieue our ruine was not theirs. Scena quarta. Caiazzo, Belgiosa, Maluezzo. Mal. My Lords, since we are met so happily, (If you esteeme me not too bo d, to aske The story of your high-fam'd actions) Blesse me with the Relation. Cai. I much feare Mine are not worthy your attention: Yet if it please you, noble Belgiosa, (Because my story will depend on that) To show the reason why the giddy French, So strangely lest their conquest: such your pow'r, Such a full conquest haue you of your friend, I'le shame my selfe for your content. Bel. Then, thus: From vs France hurry'd thorow Lumbardy And fled to conquer, who had seene that hast Would easily suppos'd it to haue beene Rather a flight then an inuasion. The Pope quakes at the progresse, and admits Yong Ferd'nand into Rome, that if the French Should dare a fight, they might find Naples there. France slights that fainter opposition, And speakes his scorne in thunder, Naples flyes, And all his army hath no other vse Then to become vnwilling harbingers To shew their lodgings to the conqu'ring French: Who like fierce winds that sweepe away their lets, Or like incroaching tydes, take swiftly in The offer'd Countries, not defended, now Saint German yeelds, and sawcy Capua That dar'd a competition once with Rome, Aversa takes the president, and now The Kng of Naples finds home foes, and such As durst be valiant against their Prince, And vse their fond armes in a mutiny, Which were not safe enough for a defence. He taking the aduantage of their crime Vnconquer'd by the French, to these he yeelds, And chuseth rather to become no Prince Then keepe the Crowne, which they would take away. Mal. What was the issue? Bel. Strangely pittifull: He that had Nauies yesterday, has now Scarce a barke left him, scarce a planke or two, To trust him to the mercy of the Seas, The Seas more courteous then the multitude: In which he makes for Ischia, and leaues His enemy his successor. Cai. And he (As I haue seene some wav'ring amorist) Neglects his conquest for the easinesse, For when twas certaine Ferdinand was fled, Whilst they might iustly yet feare his returne, The French returne, as if they meant to try Which would be soonest weary of the hast, Who had the swifter pace to runne away: Bel. That is no new act of new gouernors, Such stories are as ancient as the world. Till they doe try what they can doe, they thinke They may doe all things, their first act is warre (As if they meant rather to kill then raigne) It matters not vpon what ground: there is Pretence enough to quit a conqueror From the least shew of iniury: but then When they haue felt the least of warres extreames They raue, they faint, they crosse what they first did, And are e'ne weary of a victory. Cai. France made this certaine truth, who in his brags Had sworne the fall of Mahomet: but now When he might heare the groanes of GrÃ¦cia Deliuer'd by the ecchoes of their sea, To make them more, he thinkes on a retreat, And chuseth home before a victory: It was a vally, where our Taro laues The root of Appennine, and a large plaine Spheard with a row of swelling Earth makes warre A spatious Amphitheater: where we Stayd for their comming; when mature aduice That crownes most actions, strangely iniur'd vs, For rashnesse would haue stole a victory Which tedious consultation gaue away. Successe had smil'd on our temerity Had we assaulted them vpon the hills And added to the mountaines with the French. But I am tedious: onely our vanne fought, And twas the Frenchmens victory to resist: Both were o'recome, both conquerors, for they Still kept the field, and wee still kept the prey. Bel. O what is valour ioyn'd with Modesty! This conquers both your Fortune and your skill. Should you but write a story, and professe That purenesse from all passion which y'aue showne, You would be credited, though twere your owne. But what reward is't to be but beleeu'd? You shall be euer prays'd: what you haue done Feares neither enuy, nor obliuion: And for this act succession shall see Caiazzo as long-liu'd as Jtaly. Scena quinta. Vitellio disguised. I wonder Malatesta still suruiues: Sure Sforza has forgot himselfe; my death Does but halfe cleare him, and if th'other liue, He cannot looke for a full innocence. It is not mercy, certainly: Ã´, no, Mercy with him is folly: but t'may bee He feares that had he kild vs both at once Rumor would be too busie, and all mouths Would cry, that Chance had too much proiect in't. This is the place of Destiny, 'tis here Sforza does actuate his bloody arts, Mistaking priuacy for innocence, And thinkes hee's good, because he is not seene. Here must I wayte for a discouery. Enter Sforza. Sf. I must once more be cruell, yet not I, This is the murther of Necessity: But what has he deseru'd, who has done nought But what we charg'd, and so perform'd our thought? Is Death due to Obedience? can this hand Yeeld to his Fate, that seal'd to his command? Yet he, or I must perish: shall I see My life, my honor, my Ãternity, Lye at his mercy, and be safe, so long As he is pleas'd to temper his rude tongue? Till he be drunke, or treacherous? Ile first Study amongst all actions, which is worst And ouer-act it: though our former deed Was from ambition, this is yet from need: Death is too good reward for such a slaue, Enter Malatesta. And sure there is no blabbing in the graue. But here he comes: why are thy looks so grim? Why, Malatesta, in thy furrow'd face See I the signes of Anger, or of Griefe? Command thy face to a more smiling forme, That I may thinke thee pleas'd when thou dost tell What does displease thee. Mal. 'Twas a foolish dreame, That stole my colour from my paler cheekes. Last night I saw Uitellio. Sf. And what? Canst thou feare shadowes? Mal. Yes if shadowes speake, If that their threatnings be substantiall. From such a paper as your Highnesse holds, He forc't me breath in Death. Sf. This Paper holds A strange perfume, of such a cunning vertue, That at a distance it scarce smels at all. And at the nose it gives the best of sents. Make the experiment: Mal. O! I am slaine. Sf. Heau'ns what a stilnesse here is? what a death Of the whole man at once? the wandring eye Now findes a station, and the busie pulse Is now for euer idle: where's the tongue That but eu'n now could say as much as this, When that the soule could prompt it? but e'en now Here was a thing could speake, and poison too, That knew more wayes to kill, then euer Heau'n Did to make man: and could his subtlety, That could giue death, not know to keepe out death? Fye, what a bulke it is, what a great lumpe Of Nothing, that shall lose that nothing too? What a dead toy is Man, when his thin breath Flyes to its kindred Ayre? Ã´ why at all Did Heau'n bestow, or why at all bereaue Man of this Vapour of Eternity? And must we one day be a stocke like this, Fit onely to inrich the greedy Earth, And fill an house of Death, perhaps before We see the issue of another Plot? Must we lye subiect to be trampled on, By some, perhaps not Politicians? Where's then our Wisedome? our deepe Prouidence Are they durt too? Ã´ heau'ns! but if they are Enter some Negroes to cary away the body. Or durt, or nothing, Ile enioy my fame. And rottennesse shall ceize me, not my name. Vit. Are those the Instruments? well my black friends, I eas'd you of a labour: all succeeds According to the flatt'ry of my wish, And my suspition turnes to prophecy. But my so bloody, and so wary Sforza, Your Agent's dead, but not your crime: 'twill out, And by this carcasse: I will flye to France, Divulge loud papers,âthey are writ already,â And here they are, these I will sweare were found In the dead pois'ners pockets: by this meanes Sforza's proclaim'd a murtherer, I'me freed, And make it be his guilt, which was my deed. Uitellio going forth meets with Isabella. Scena quinta. Uitellio , Jsabella, Julia. Madame I haue some newes of that import, That (if you please to command priuacy) Will both desire, and fright your patience. Is. Be briefe. Vit. First know I am Vitellio. Is. Thou art a villaine, and a pois'ner then, Hast thou a drugge for vs? Vit. Yes such an one Shall make you loue a poyson: reade, and wonder. Is. I doe: and more, how thou couldst purchase this Without a guilt. Vit. I did peruse the spoyles Of Malatesta's carcasse, whom I found Most strangely guilty, and as strangely dead, Whose pockets furnisht me with these instructions. Is. Thus we learne Murther from thy Fellony: But what should make me trust a confest rogue? Vit. My villany: my credit is my crime: Had not I stole, you had not vnderstood. Is. I must beleeu't: but darst thou poison well? Commit a crime, which thou maist glory of? Vit. On whom deare Lady? Is. Nay I care not whom. But I can giue reward to a wise crime. Vit. My quicke dispatch shall make you gladly know I vnderstand, what you desire, and hide. Exit. Is. Now should he poison Sforza. O fond hope! That mak'st vs thinke all true that we desire. Should he betray vs now? for what? that we Intreated him to kill, we knew not whom. By this expression thus much I haue wonne: I may be made, but cannot be vndone. Scena sexta. Picinino. Fortune is merry, and the heau'n dispos'd To play with me, I am turn'd Fauourite. Me thinkes my haires asham'd of their white hue Should blush to youth: O how I could looke big, Take Gyant strides, doat on my louely selfe, And talke as silly as any Lord. To see the prettinesse of action, Of State-imployment: Sforza's to be crown'd, And I must winne the popular suffrages. Good Heau'ns! was euer such a merry load Impos'd on Man: some cry the times are ill, Others could wish them better, and a third Knowes how to make all well, but tels not how, And, cause, that he is silent, would be wise. But in conclusion I doe finde them ready (On supposition of no more expence, And that their voice is su'd for, not their purse) To giue a lusty acclamacion. Sforza, 3 Ambassadors, Caiazzo, Sanseuerin, Maluezzo, as in procession, they offer vp the French Banners at the Altar, whilst this is sung. Song. Io, Io, gladly sing, Till the Heau'n with wonder ring. He is fled, let Millan say Once more, he is fled, the day Cleares againe, and makes vs see A brauer light of victory. Io, Io, &amp;c. Yet he had before he fought (By the speedy warre of thought) Conquer'd Italy, and so Has hasten'd his owne ouerthrow. Io, Io, &amp;c. Henceforth let them learne to liue In the peace, that home doth giue, Nor againe so fondly raue, To trauell for a forren graue. Io, Io, &amp;c. Sf. First we thanke Heau'n, by whose most gracious ayd We haue the meanes, and reason to thanke you. Now we beginne to lift vp our faint heads, And entertaine, though scarce beleeue a peace: Now Italy at length has lost her yoake, Which she was wont to giue, but neuer beare, And therefore wondred at the strangenesse more Then at the weight of't: in this noble act Sforza claimes nothing but the happinesse, Which he acknowledges receiu'd from you. 1 Amb. Sforza's deserts exceed the height of praise. 2 Amb. He has slau'd Italy by freeing it. 3 Amb. Millan must know him for her Romulus. Sf. We know our selfe so vnderneath this praise, That could we but suspect vntruth in you, Wee'd call all this but mockery. Pic. D'yee doubt? Make you a question of the name of it? Why call it as it is, plaine flattery. Caiaz. We wondred lately at the prouder French, And gaue too high a valew to their acts: When in a serious estimation, Their chiefest victory was of the miles, And more a iourney then a warre: if they Could gaine a fame by nimble trauelling, How shall we reare a trophee to his name, That made them goe farre faster then they came? For my part (though I know his Modesty, Which will refuse the honours he deserues) I'de haue him forc'd vnto the gouernment, To rule that happy land which he hath sau'd. Omnes. A Sforza, a Sforza. Ascanio crowns him. Sf. Sforza will ne're gainesay the gen'rall voice, Your loue I like beyond your gift: kind Heau'ns! Shew by my gouernments integrity You were the peoples prompter, and I'le shew (If you but actuate my iust desires) I onely am their Duke in goodnesse: since Millan hath chose, it shall applaud her Prince.</field>

Fortune is fearfull of so foule a crime. Asc. You durst be bad, and yet improuident, And so it is not Fortunes, but your crime. Which shall I first beginne to blame? your fault Or (pardon if I call it) Foolishnesse: I faint to thinke that you are past excuse, Both with the honest and the Politicke. Sf. Come neerer, my deare Cardinall, and tell In easier termes what tis that troubles you: Is Galeazzo's death divulg'd? Asc. It is: The time, the manner, and the murtherer, Nor am I free from th'imputation. Sf. You speake what you suspect, not what is true, Does speech come from the dead? can their dry'd nerues Borrow a tongue for accusation? This is no other then the voice of Guilt, The speech of our home-executioner: And yet I feareâand yet what should I feare? Bloud hath strange organs to discourse withall, It is a clamorous Oratour, and then Enter Sanseuerin, Halberdeers &amp; Vitel. Euen Nature will exceed her selfe to tell A crime so thwarting Nature. Sans. My good Lord, Pardon the zeale of my intrusion, I bring hid danger with me: 'twas my chance As I was passing to the bed chamber, Iust at the doore to finde this muffled man, Waiting some trecherous opportunity. Each circumstance swell'd with suspition, The place, the time, the person, all did seeme To beare a danger worthy of your feare, At least your wiser disquisicion. Sf. Thou art all goodnesse, and deseru'st of vs Beyond the niggardly reward of thankes: But what are you that thus be cloud your face, Who, not vnlike that ouer-bashfull fowle, He discouers himselfe. Delight in darknesse? Ha! Vitellio! The wonder is resolu'd by a new wonder. Ex. Sans. Vit. Sforza I liue: d'yee stare? I liue: these words Are not the fond delusions of the Ayre, As you officiously would gull your selfe; But from a solid substance, had not we Enter Sans. with two Negroes.

Foole that I was, who thought to take thy life By that which nourisht it: there's none so mad Would poison Serpents, Ile worke surely now, Once more Ile try your immortality. Strangle the Monster. Uit. 'Twas a doubtfull chance Within this houre who first should owne those words. But, Tyrant, weary thy inuention To finde variety of punishment, Yet all that thou canst doe, exceeds not this, A pinne could doe as much: weake, silly Sforza, All thou canst doe to me exceeds not that Which I did on the person of thy Prince: Disease would proue a better murtherer. Sf. Stop that malignant throat.âO my Ascanio, Thus must they toyle which worke an hight by bloud, How I could wish an innocent descent To new subiection? how I hate that wish! How scorne all thoughts that haue not danger in them Get vs more Remora's, sweet Cardinall, Or rather then to droope to Idlenesse, Wee'll worke to be no Prince, our selfe re-calling: In rising, most, some wit there is in falling. Scena tertia. Caiazzo. Assist me, Hell, for I intend an Act, Which should your puny fiends but thinke vpon, Would make their blacker cheekes receiue a blush, Would giue a rednesse which your weaker Fire Had ne're that heating pow'r to worke in them: An act, the Heau'ns did onely then declare They would permit to be perform'd by man When they created Night: for were all Day, Could such a Crime be as well seene as done, Their Immortality might iustly seare, Lest all the guilt should be remou'd on them, As Idle, or as Cruell lookers on, Whilst Heau'n, on Earth did suffer: this blacke night Must Isabella dye, dye, by this hand: This Chappell is her ordinary walke, Discouer'd to me by her Iulia, Where when she comes to see her husbands tombe, This hand shall make her fit for such a roome. Enter Isabella and Iulia with two torches, shee places them at either end of the Tome, &amp; Exit. Isabella drawes towards the Tombe, and speaks. Is. Prince of shades, (for vnto me Still thou keep'st thy Maiesty) If thou art not wholly lost, And there's something in a Ghost: Heare thy Isabella's vow: If hereafter I allow Of a second match, or know Any man, but for a foe, Sauing him that shall ingage His reuenge vnto my rage: (Heare iust Heau'ns) may J then be Made another Ghost like thee, May I dye, and neuer haue What I visit now, a Graue. Cai. O doe not heare her Heau'n, and kill me straight If I dare touch her: he that sees those eyes And dares attempt to make those eyes not see, Has a blinde soule: burne clearer, you kind lights, O doe not enuy me the sight of her: But what's there in a sight? I must be briefe, If not for loue, yet for ambition: Her Mariage makes me greater then her Death, And she has taught me the condition. Pardon, bright Angell, and returne the sword, Which Sforza made me sweare to sheath in you, Into my bosome Is. No, obey your Prince, If you haue goodnesse in you keepe your oath, Murther is nothing vnto periury. Cai. By this faire hand you iniure me, and more Then euer Sforza did: can you suppose (Though you had heard the vowes he forc't me to) I meant what I protested? that this hand Which euer yet has vs'd a sword for you, Would vse it now for your destruction. Reuoke that thought, deare Lady, that harsh thought, And let not so much sweeter innocence Make it selfe guilty by suspition, Suspition of impossibilities. Rather command, and you shall quickly see That he, who would haue arm'd me against you, Shall finde in his owne entrailes the iust steele. Is. aside. What traps are these to catch the Innocent? Sforza I smell your proiect, 'tis too ranke. My Lord, no more: your speech is dangerous, I must not heare it. Cai. You shall see it then: Doe not beleeue me Madam till I'ue done, Till I doe bring my credit in my armes, The Traitors head, and when you see that time, Confesse you owe your life vnto my crime. Scena quarta. Picinino, Iuliano. Iul. What will become of this declining state? Can we beleeue that the yet patient heau'n Will any longer suffer? and not giue Destruction as notorious as our crimes. Awake, sterne Iustice, and vnsheath thy sword, The Scabberd will not heale vs, but the edge, Nor is't enough to brandish, but to strike: Let then thy terrour giue vs innocence, That mildnesse may no longer iniure man. Pic. Why, thou perpetuall Murmurer, thou sea Tost with eternall tempest, thou darke sky With euerlasting clouds, thouâany thing, Whom, being angry I can call no more: Thinke better of those acts thou canst not mend. Will Sforza be lesse bad, because thou whin'st? Or dost thou thinke thy pittifull complaints Can beg a goodness: of Ascanio? I neuer knew that mighty vse of teares, That they could wash away anothers fault: When thou shalt want a teare for a fit griefe, Sanseuerin will be a Coward still: And when thy groanes are turn'd to thy last gaspe, Caiazzo will not be lesse trecherous. Enter Sanseuerin, with diuers suitors following him, some of whose bils be teares, others laughs at, others puts vp. Exit. Iul. Now for thy thunder, Heau'n, now for a piece Of thy most eminent Artillery. Are you still silent? see, he teares their papers, Papers, perhaps, wherein they worship him, Giue him more titles, then they giue their God, And yet he teares them. O vast Fauourite! Swell'd by the airy fauour of thy Prince, Till thou hast dimm'd the light that made thee shine, Till Sforza's lesse then his Sanseuerin. Tell me, good Picinino, does the Sunne Spend all his rayes vpon one Continent? Or haue you euer seene the partiall Heau'ns Vpon one Aker lauish all her showres, While the rest moulder with dry barrennesse? Pic. I haue not, Iuliano, but what then? Jul. Are you to leeke for the collection? Why, has not Sforza made himselfe our Sunne? Are not his fauours our refreshing showres? Why should one sucke vp what is due to all, Why is the Prince made a Monopoly? Pic. Thou mak'st me laugh at thy fond question: What? are not Princes men, of the same mould, Of the same passions with inferiours? Doe not they feare, desire, and hate (as we) And shall we onely hinder them from loue? Coblers may haue their friends, and why not Kings? Because th'are higher then the rest of men, Shall they be therefore worse? and therefore want The Benefits, because they haue the Rule? O hard condition of Maiesty! The former accusation of Kings Has beene their cruelty, that they did hate The people they should gouerne: O hard plight! O strange peruersnesse! shall their loue at length, Their friendship be imputed as their fault? Would Heau'n our Sforza had no worse a crime. Enter Sanseuerin againe with his traine of Suitors. Iul. You are a worthy Aduocate, and here Comes your great Patron: goe and aske your see. Sans. This is a sawcy importunity: You haue your answer. 1 Sutor. O my gracious Lord, Looke on these scarres I gain'd in the French warre, Where I haue lost my Fortunes. 2 Sutor. So haue I, Scarce left aliue to tell my misery. Sans. You haue bin drunk, and quarrell'dâmust the State Finde plaisters for your broken heads?âno moreâ Nay, if you'll take no answer, I must call Them that will driue you hence. O my tyr'd eares! Henceforth I vow to stoppe them at your suites, And be as Deafe, as you are Impudent. Exit. Iul. Yes, doe good Ãolusâhow he blowes them hence! How cleares his passage with a lusty frowne! And yet it may be that despised wretch Worne out of cloathes, and flesh, whom his high scorne Would not vouchsafe once more to looke vpon, Durst in the field doe more, then he durst see, Then he would there vouchsafe to looke vpon. Pic. As if that Valour were the onely praise, And none were to be lou'd, but they that fight: Where were we then? what would become of vs? Thou thinkst it Paradox, but tis most true, A Souldier is the greatest enemy, Of whom the Common-wealth can be afraid: Preferre you which you please; yet vnto them Which are the sole Physitians of State, Who with the teeming of a pregnant braine, Search the diseases and the remedies, Valour is nothing but a desp'rate vice, And there's no safety, but in cowardice. Scena quinta. Sforza, Ascanio, Maluezzo. Sf. We are not man, for such an empty thing Could not haue this solidity of ioy: Say the French King is dead, and say withall We are immortall, and ones happy truth, Shall expiate for the others flattery. But speake the manner too as well, as death. Asc. When now his gadding thoughts had won the world, And Jtaly was to be taken in But onely as an easie seat, from whence He might deriue his further victories; Ottoman quak'd, and 'twas in chance, if now New Rome, should be new-French, &amp; the proud Turke Be brought to know what their beginnings were; When Fortune had aduanc'd him to that height, That growne forgetfull of a lowly tombe, He rear'd huge Pyramides, and troubled Art To match his fancy with magnificence Fit for a conqu'ring builder, who had learnt To ruine first, and then to build a City, When Marbles were to be inrich with wounds, And cut for their aduancement: then, Heau'ns sport, He rais'd competitors to dare the Heau'ns: Nor dreames his owne descent into low Earth. Sf. Ascanio, you make him liue too long, Tell how he dy'd, without more circumstance. Asc. He went (such was his vse) to see the play At Tennis-court, when by his trembling Queene He sanke into halfe-death: thence he's conuey'd To the next roome, where on a couch of straw, As if a downe-bed were too soft for him, Whom rottennesse attended, and the graue, That harder lodging of Mortality, A King, a conqu'ring, youthfull King expires. Thrice from deaths slumbers he awak't to speake, Thrice did he cry to heau'n, vnto deafe heau'n, And after nine houres death he dy'd. Sf. I find A certaine grumbling against Fortune here: Which that I may whet to a liuely rage, Repeat Maluezzo her last treachery Against the French, and Neopolitan. Mal. Naples now wonne, and the vnstable French (As if they were afraid of their owne lucke) Ridiculously leauing what th'ad wonne; The Deputy was Mompenieer, a man Of an high birth, but of vnequall deeds. For when yong Ferdinand with some few boates (Which onely feare might make a Nauy of, And nothing but the strength of cowardize Could possibly iudge strong) approacht the shoare, As if the poore Prince once more had desir'd Onely to see his ancient gouernement, And therefore had aduentur'd to the Sea, The Sea was in the City, for ne're was Such a confusion in the vulgar waues: All cry a Ferdinand, a Ferdinand, Eu'n those who lately banisht Ferdinand: Part ope the gates to him, and part shut vp The French into the Cittadells, where he Besiegeth his once Conquerors. Sf. Tis true Not the world onely, but a man's a ball, Will Fortune neuer leaue her tossing him? Mal. Whether their owne neglect forc'd them to want, Or want to yeeld, 'tis doubted: but they yeeld: Thus as in triuiall sports we oft haue seene After a tedious inconstancy, The Corke returne to him that strucke it first, So in this fatall reuolution, Fortune giues Naples vnto him againe, Whom she first iniur'd in the taking it. Sf. Who hearing this would not erect his soule To a contempt of Fortune! that blind wretch Whom onely sottishnesse hath Deifi'd? Man hath a nobler Godhead in himselfe, His vertue and his wisdome, vnto these Bend all our knees, let vs still honour these: And count it comfort in our lowest state, He that is wise, would not be fortunate.

But what did this point cost me? this small blot? My innocence, my conscience, my soule; I kill'd a Nephew, to obtaine this blot, O horrid purchase! all this toyle, this guilt For so despis'd a Nothing? let me see, Here is no roome to sit, to walke, to stand, In all my land I cannot place my selfe, Nor be at all, where I would be the Duke.

Then I see to dye Is more to right, then suffer iniury. Know I am still thy Prince, and if that man In such a Miracle of villaine can At last be sound, in this thy manhood show That thou darst heare thy doome of ouerthrow. Sf.

Descendit vmb. Sf. Sinke into earth, and doe not reach thy hell, Propheticke bubble: might thy threats proue true, For we could wish the death that thou foretell'st, That our feirce shadow might pursue thee still, To fright thy Ghost to nothing: O weake Heau'ns!

It cannot be, good Iulian, no more: I doe not loue these ouer-earnest dreames. The French inuade vs? when their iolly King With limber slaues does onely mocke a warre, Which like so many reeds against a stone Punish their owne attempt with their owne ruine, Breaking themselues, not armors: when we know The Court is lost in Maskes, reality Is so farre fled since the last victory, That we may thinke the Court it selfe a maske, Ãternall Musicke, reuells without end Tire the too-much delighted souldier, Whose armes haue now forgot their ancient vse, His spirits onely actiue in his heeles, And canst thou thinke theyle dance to Italy? Jul. I'ue heard some tell that a great City once Was built by Musicke: would we might not find Our Country to be ruin'd by a dance: O feare the toying of an enemy. Pic.

Iul. As many as we haue deseru'd: not one: Sforza has too much wisedome to haue friends. Pic. And we haue too muchâI said nothing, did I? I did not speake against the State, I hope? Nor said that we had too much patience? Iul. Is Picinino then orecome at last, Now I could change my sorrow for a smile. Pic. I must confesse an anger though not griefe: O how I loue to fit me to mischance! And when that has no reason, then I'me mad. Why should our Millan blood staine the french swords Vnto a glory? Sforza does offend, Deny's the heau'nly pow'rs, or names them then, When he does dare them with bold periury, Loads his blacke soule with murther of a man That could haue made his execution, iustice. This Sforza does, but what is this to me? Why shall this throat be cut for his? why thine? Why shall our Countryes ruine fill his penance? The heau'ns doe know no meane but either wast Their benefits on dull ingratitude Or throw away their thunder, so it hit So it not faile, they care not whom it strike, Whether the guilty, or the innocent. Iul. This is a griefe of higher fault then mine, You make a warre with them you should appease, And vrge the heau'ns to our calamities. First we were punisht with, and now for Sforza, Could any iustice haue more method in't. Pic. Well Iulian, Ime sorry for my griefe, And so perswade thee to that holy truth. I now could raue against my selfe, not heau'n, But tis as fruitlesse, as to wish good lucke: Then let the French presse vpon victory, Let them amaze the Ayre with stranger fire, Rais'd by our Cities flaming Funeralls. Swell they the Poe with blood, act o're, what ere Has beene the brag of royall murtherers, Yet our defence is here: Fortune may faile But our true souls shall neuer, we may lose An aged life, but not Ãternity: And with this strength the field must needs be ours: Who doe not feare, doe beat the Conquerors.

Pardon, my Lord, ill Fortunes eloquence, Vnlesse you heare you cannot cure your harmes; The French, now enter'd Lombardy, sat downe Before Valenza: where the mouth of Death, The thundring Canon being scarcely brought, But iust presented to the yet sound wall, Discouered there was somewhat more vnsound: For Rattagnino, the false Gouernour Entreats a Parly, giues away the strength, Sweares the towne French, and giues the key to them, With which they open Lombardy. Sf. My fact; None can be guilty of this crime, but I: That after Treason durst againe trust treason. This very man, whose easie heart relents At a French death, and wisely is afraid His manners might be call'd in question, If he should put them off to sue againe, To aske the second time, for what he held: Out of his zeale to vertue, and good lucke, Did the like act for vs, and gaue a strength Ent. Mal. wounded Which all our Duchy neuer could haue forc't. What more reuolting yet? Mal. O my good Lord! I feare this is beyond Addition. O my blood failes me, but my tongue does more, Fearing the story that it must relate. Your Army being parted, and this halfe Caiazzo leading, that Sanseuerin, My troopes did fall among the French mens scouts. From whom we learn't their numbers, and intent, To march with speed for Millan: this sad newes We sent to Count Caiazzo, with aduice, That he would instantly reioyne with vs, To stop their further entrance: hee pretends That the Venetians hemming in his campe Haue made his danger greater: yet he moues, Makes to the riuer, and when now our thoughts Had left their wau'ring, and did seeme assur'd His actions would be better then his words, I saw, O misery that ere I saw! That crossing o're the Po he did embrace Those men which be in duty should haue kill'd: (O tis this kils me, not my want of blood) I in iust anger set vpon the Reare, And after many vaine attempts, haue brought My carkasse, to intreat for my reuenge. Sf. This is conspiracy: Caiazzo false? Tell me that contradictions then are true, Tell me the heau'ns no more doe trauell now Being growne inconstant to their motion: Or that the Earth pursie with too long ease VVould with a walke at length refresh her selfe: Tell me that Princes may be fortunate, Those that like me are credulous: or if You'd speake of things more hard to be beleeu'd, Tell me, there are, that birth of feare, call'd Gods, And if they be, that they doe thinke of Man: Tell me, O prethee tell me somewhat else, Or I shall thinke thee false, and not Caiazzo, But I doe know thee true, know thy wounds true, Enter Sanseuerin And must conclude Caiazzo is most false. Sans. To be o'recome, my Lord, is wretched chance, But not to fight at all will be thought crime, I ne're durst thinke so to suruiue ill lucke As to become the fatall messenger? But I must say, I durst not fight, and more, I must intreat your cowardize, your foes Are strengthned with your Army (Ã´ pardon me Let me not tell you, how) and all our troopes, Haue no pow'r left vs but for a safe flight. Sf. I did expect this: was not man at first Plac'd on this curious Theater, to see How he could act all parts: doe we not know What we can feare is nothing? prouidence Long since hath spent our feare; for a wise man, WVhen he does found his happinesse, forecasts Mischiefes, that Fate had neuer practiz'd yet, Which if they happen, if they proue too true, They meet, not ouertake him, and so find A scorne, because a preparation. I knew it might be thus, though I not fear'd, And know it may be better, though not hope: Yet let vs ne're despaire, nor by low thoughts Excuse Fate for her present iniury. And when once more her fauours we shall feele, Then say, that Fortune has no standing wheele. Scena quinta. Enter at one doore, Triulcio, Aubeny, Caiazzo: at the other some Senators of Millan, who deliuer the keyes of the City. Sen. We here present you with our keys great Lords, Yet doe not thinke vs cowards, who doe part So easily with that, which if we pleas'd We might, in spite of force, as easily keepe: We know your right, iustice does ope these gates, And not your swords, nor our disloyalty; We leaue a Traytor that hath first left vs, And now are glad to entertaine our Prince. Triv. Is he fled then? O our vnhappy sloath! Why ranne we not as well as we did fight? Are Cowards swifter then their Conquerors. Aboue as in the Cittadell appeare Isabella, and Iulia. Is. Doe not disswade me, Iulia, 'tis true I may escape, but whither? all is lost, In Naples we find France, as well as here. O who'od indure the tyranny of hope, That could so quickly gaine a liberty? If I but fall I'me free; Ã´ Iulia, The greatest distance twixt my blisse, and me, Reacheth no farther then to the next earth. Can I behold in a perplexed flight (Of which I know no comfort, and no end) This my sweet infant crying for the food, Which I'me vncertaine where to beg for him? No, Ile descend, and if the greedy French Will haue our blood with our Dominions, She comes down with some souldiers. Yet I shall ioy to haue a speedy end And call a nimble enemy, a friend. Tri. What answer from the Cittadel? once more Giue them a summons, if they yeeld not then Enter Isabella Giue an assault. Is. You shall not need my Lords, What you could wish you haue, most cheapely haue, The conquest of a woman, and a child. I'me Isabella, (let not that sad name Be ominous to conquerors,) and this This pretty infant, is my lucklesse child, Borne Prince of that, which you haue made your prey. Why doe you one consult anothers face, As you would see, who could be cruell first? Be not at all, or if at all, to me. O doe not warre with infants! can these hands Deserue your feare or anger? these weake hands That cannot reach themselues vnto their teat? Who haue so much of yong infirmity, They cannot lift themselues to ask your mercy? O let them haue, because they cannot aske. How many dismall accidents may chance To take him hence, before he grow to man, And so excuse, and yet fulfill your purpose? O let disease be cruell, and not you. Tri. Madame, you shall be honourably vs'd, You, and your faire sonne: take your liberty To chuse your owne free course: for this yong Lord, He must to France with vs, where he shall learne The good of royall education: Where he shall know the happy difference Betweene a petty, and a kingly Court. Some waite vpon the Princesse. Is. O my starres! What haue I done? ay me? I haue betrayd, What Tyranny had left me, my sweet boy: For whom I neuer knew a griefe; till now I brought him forth with pleasure, when I thinke Vpon this paine of parting; my deare child, O too too like thy mother; if thou chance To draw thy life vnto that hated length, That thou arriue to the discretion To know, what by my folly, thou hast lost, Call it no more, Ã´ doe not call it crime, No mother willingly would lose a sonne: Whilst in some darker cell I will intombe Thy ruines cause, where whatsoeuer teare Sorrow did once force, no deuotion shall: That my new name vnto the heau'ns may reach Whom misery the way to blisse did teach. Exit. Tri. Neuer till now had we the victory, And now no single one, this happy houre Has gain'd a a conquest for Posterity. They may be idle now, now the French youth May grow vp without wounds, and at their homes, Steale to a priuate graue, no more being forc't To death, though by a glory; nay this Land May thanke vs, for our thrift of victory, For lighting on this blest occasion, Which makes vs need no more to conquer them: If heau'n continue vs this kindnesse still, Wee'll measure out our conquests by our will.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quinti Scena prima. Sforza, Ascanio, Sanseuerin. Sf. O what is man? and all that happinesse That puffes him to security? to day One acts a Prince, and swell'd with Maiesty Fills a proud throne, from whence the Multitude Thinkes he rules Fortune too, as well as them, Whilst she in iust esteeme of her owne name, Makes him forgot, or odious, that none Can be so miserably fool'd, to wish His well-apparell'd misery: thus we That did enioy beyond a Crowne, a braine Able to meet, or challenge the worst chance: Yet in the space of a few dayes, a space Of too short lasting to expell a man (By the most subtle fetches of the Law) Out of a false inheritance: we lost, We were expell'd out of a Monarchy; But does Fate make a stand at this? O no, She is not constant, no not in her curse, But giuing most againe, which once was mine She giues me too the capability Of a new curse. Asc. Of a new ioy: for shame Giue thankes at least for your felicity: Can you repine being cramm'd, and so deserue A bountifull vnhappinesse? I'ue knowne Some that haue long endur'd a tedious siege, Or a more tedious sicknesse, who haue beene Forst to a lasting Lent, when they haue come Or to their health, or to their liberty, Not dare to take the nourishment they might, Making themselues their sicknesse, and their foe: Is not my Sforza one of these? you grieue Because you haue no longer cause to grieue. Sans. O I doe feare your griefe, that it does glance With a most vndeseru'd disgrace at me; As if I were a-kinne vnto the fault Of my false brother: O repeat that thought, It is no great thing I request you to, But trust vnto the faith that you haue found. Would I betray, and follow you? d'yee thinke, I'de be so mad to buy my banishment? No man would be vnprofitably false, Nor I for any profit: speake your selfe If I haue left you, when your Fortune did? Nay, then my loue was greatest, when you least, I was your subiect, when you were no Prince. Sf. Sanseuerin, thy feare is too too fond, And like the people, the Authoritie, Who make an impious confusion Of an high birth, and of an higher crime: Who in a sawcy thwarting to their Prince, Count him still worst, whom he has made the best, As if we gaue him, with his honors, crimes, And made him vicious, when fortunate. No, let them spend their breath in idle talke, Count thee or trecherous, or cowardly? Whilst to thy Sforza thou art still the same, Most valiant, and with thy valour, wise, That by thy abstinence a while from warre, Hast sau'd vs forces for a victory. Sans. The Subiects life lies in the Princes voice: Now you haue cleer'd me I dare hasten warre, And wish more enemies, then cowards feare: That you may see, by my neglect of bloud, (Which I shall onely loue when shed for you) How slaunder was my most fear'd enemy. Sf. No more, my dearest friend: we lose all time Which we doe saue from fight, still there does flocke New forces to our Army, and the French Are now as much amaz'd, as proud before: We lately tooke the Swizzers into pay, Those that dare fell their liues to any cause, Whom Gold hath arm'd for me: if they proceed In their first heat, we winne: but if they faile We cannot be more wretched then we were: The vilest chance of lucke can make vs know But an Addition to an Ouerthrow. Scena secunda. The Captaine of the Swizzers, with a Souldier, as a fugitiue from the French. Soul. Now w'are alone I dare reueale my selfe, I am not what I seeme, a Fugitiue, But one that from Triulcio doe bring Letters that much concerne you. Capt. VVhat? to me? Letters vnto his enemy? let's see: Ex. Soul. Expect an answer in my Tent.âVVhat's here? Letter. Thou Man of Action, whom th'Italians Feele their Achilles, both to wound, and beale: Triulcio salutes thee: what is past, As past recall he will not mention, But for the future this; you ayd a man, From whom you cannot any way expect Reward, or Honor, such his pouerty Both in desert, and meanes? but against whom? J will not vrge they are your Countrymen, Partakers of the same sweet soyle with you, Who onely differ in their better choice: Yet so farre doe I prize your worth, to thinke, You haue not put off Nature, nor haue chang'd With your home ayre, your home-affections. That you are still a Swizzer: thinke of this, And that at other times twere shame to flye, Now onely flight shewes Magnanimity. Triulcio. What shall I doe? O I am lost in doubt, Nor know, what to refuse, or what to grant. Shall then the Swizzers to their valour adde A tainture of disloyaltie? to whom? Who can accuse vs for our trechery? One that has patroniz'd it by his act: That hath betraid his Nephew: shall a man Be counted trecherous, that betrayes vice? It was a crime to aide him, can it be A crime to leaue him too? O paradox! Resolue me Goodnesse what tis best to doe: And that does whisper a dislike: for what, What goodnesse can there be in ciuill warre? When we shall kill them that were borne with vs, When we shall make the Father dye his sword In the sonnes bloud, and strangely giue a death To him, to whom he kindly gaue a life, When the mixt bloud of the same Family Shall make a cruell incest: this we doe If we are honest: Ile learne treason first, And the most accurate sinne. Triulcio, Our Country calls vs, and not thou, to be Dishonest then is the best honesty. Ex. Scena tertia. Picinino in his study, with a Deaths-head and a Watch. Pic. This is the summe, I can but be like this. After the prouder threatning of the French, After the sure impression of Disease, I can but be like this: then let me thinke What losse I haue when I am made like this: This feares no French: a peece of ordinance Can breake, but not astonish this, no force Can draw a teare, no not a sigh from hence: And can it be a losse to be like this? O Death! why art thou fear'd? why doe we thinke Tis such a horrid terror Not to Be? Why, not to be, is, not to be a wretch, Why, not to be, is, to be like the heau'ns, Not to be subiect to the pow'r of Fate: O there's no happinesse but not to be. to the Watch. But thou discloser of the stealth of Time, Let me inquire how much is worne away Of this sad houre: the halfe? O speedy time! That mak'st vs feele, ere we can thinke of Age, Ere we can take an order for the Graue. Enter Iul. Iul. What? deepe in meditation, noble friend? So studious of your Watch? alas good man, Thou needst not this faint helpe to guesse at Fate, These siluer haires are watch enough for thee. Pic. I onely looke how many minutes hence Millan expires. Jul. O swift Arithmeticke, To summe by minutes our sad Duchies age. Pic. This Watch doth teach reall Philosophy, There is no tutor to this actiue brasse: What is a Kingdome, but a larger watch? Wound vp by Fate vnto some scores of yeares, And then it falls: good Iuliano list, Harke how it beats, how strongly, and how fast, Beyond the motion of a nimble pulse: Who would not thinke this were a lasting noise? And yet it ends: after some date of houres The watch will be as silent as the head. O tis our folly, folly, my deare friend, Because we see th'actiuity of States, To flatter them with false Eternity: Why longer then the dweller lasts the house? Why should the world be alwaies, and not man? Sure kingdomes are as mortall as their Kings, And stay but longer for their period. Iul. I feare our Climactericall is now: When all professions turne to souldier, To that curst Art that thriues by Destiny. The sithes are straighted into swords, and th'Earth Being not wounded is vndone, where once Stood buildings, which an humble Poetry Without too bold a swelling might giue Kings: Whole Mines vndone to beautifie one roofe, Now onely Desolation dwels: weake griefe, To say Corne growes, where once a City stood, That sustenance is there where no men are, This is a trifling, and halfe misery: Our Lands now onely furnish vs with Graues, Can hide vs, but not feed vs; we would thinke Our Cities standing, though the buildings fell, If we had no griefe, but Fertility. Pic. But on what strength does Sforza still subsist Against so powrefull foes? Iul. The Emperor Has sold him some few Almaines, but his hopes Chiefly depend vpon the valiant Swizze, Who were the chiefe in his depression. Pic. Has his grosse braine not learnt the danger yet Of bringing strangers into Italy? He call'd the French to Naples, who haue now Found Millan too: O what's the difference Betwixt a mercenary and a foe? But that we kill one for his outrages, And hyre the other? Juliano, I May feele misfortune, but will neuer buy. Ex. Scena quarta. Sforza, Sanseuerin. Sans. The French are mighty, and portentously Rise by their fall: strong shame begets a rage, And a disdaine, that you whom they expell'd Should hazard their expulsion, makes them hazard, What ere being ventur'd, addes a fame to Man, And giues a glory to his misery. They are so farre from the base feare of death, That they embrac't, and like those fiercer curres, That spend their anger on the senselesse stone Not daring to attempt on him that threw, They with a senselesse anger breake the darts That naile them to the Earth, as if they scorn'd Their killer should suruiue them: other lets, As heat, or hunger, are their exercise: That one would thinke they'd lost all part of man VVhen they did meane to shew the best: my Lord, I wish a swift, but loue a certaine conquest: I thinke twere wisedome to protract the fight. Sf. I know thou speakst what thou thinkst best: but know, Tis wisedome to delay on equall fame: But when a foe has wonne opinion, Which drawes all eyes, and hearts to him, O then A valiant desperation fits a man: For victory is not impossible, And honour necessary: my best friend, Call forth our Swizzers, and if happy swords Though few, may cut a way to glory, come: Enter Capt with Swiz: The purchase is aboue the paines: but here Come they that shall fill histories: braue friends Now is the time we shall imploy your swords, And teach the world your valour. Capt. You may faile: 'Tis better to be wise: Sforza, I'me come To take my leaue of you, nor shall much breath Be spent in ceremoniall complement, I am the French Kings souldier. Sf. Speake low, Let not the ayre feele such a treason, know There is a pow'r aboue vs, and that pow'r Thunders sometimes, I know, thou darst not stand In contestation with the pow'r of heau'n: Reuoke thy words. Capt. Ile doe no miracles: My voice and faith are past. Sf. Yes they are past: Thou art made vp all of disloyalty, Reason hath nothing of thee: yet relate (If thou hast any reliques left of sense, Ile not coniure thee by strange Honesty) Why dost thou leaue the heau'ns, and vs, and so For nothing dost commit a double Treason? Cap. Ile satisfie you thus, you see I doe't: Strike vp a march. Sf. Yet stay: what is the price That makes thee trecherous, Ile turne prodigall To buy thee to a vertue: stay: be rich, Without a curse, without a fault. Cap. Tis vaine, I'me deafe to Rhetoricke: yet say th'ast met With a good periurer, my word is past, And to be twice a traytor, is a fault No sorrow can attone for: yet thus farre Ile straine my selfe to please thee, tis well knowne, Vnlesse you get vnto Ascanio, Your hopes are at the last, but betweene you And him, the French haue interpos'd themselues, Nothing remaines but that you trust to me, And in a Swizzers coat disguise your selfe, That you may passe their Army. Sf. O hard strait, Must Sforza impotently hide himselfe? Or can a Prince be hid? I haue oft heard Sparkes of Diuinity adorne his face, To cleare him from the multitude: why then, The being a Prince will make vs be no Prince, We being betraid by our owne Maiesty. Yet off ye enuy'd roabes, fall to the Earth, O fall so low, that henceforth Man may scorne The labour of descent to take you vp: On, on, ye happy roabes, that like good clouds Doe not obscure, but for a time defend The threatned Sunne, that he may after shine With higher vigour: I haue heard of some, That weare their flesh with hairecloth for their crimes, As thinking to be good if they were rough, By such a wilde repentance: be it so Enter Triulcio with the French. These robes offended, then there is an hope These ragges may expiate heau'n Tri. Braue souldiers, How we reioice we may embrace at last, Not with arm'd hands, without the guilt and shame Of ciuill murther! but are these the troupes That now must learne to vse their valour well? To giue a death without a prodegy? A conqu'ring cheerfulnesse adornes their face. These are not common souldiers: looke you pale, Then I must know the mystery. Cap. I'me betrayd. Tri. Yea I know all, but yet from thy forc'd tongue Will I extract confession; fetch a racke, To make him howle the truth, he will not speake. Cap. I can dare torments for wise honesty, But when you know as much as I can tell, Should I conceale't, all policy would iudge, I did deserue the worst that I endur'd: Who told you this was Sforza? Sf. O my braine! Must subtletie perish by subtlety? And our high wisedome finde a Conqueror? Make an end Nature, the great worke is done, Sforza is ouer-reachtâweake, childish rage: Is this to lessen, or make misery? Can passion loose vs, or a courteous teare Wash off our fetters? if it can, poure eyes, Poure out wet comfort; if it can, refuse The curse of slumber, but it cannot, then Couet a slumber euerlastingly, And be like me, imprison'd in your lids. Conuey vs quickly hence, kinde friends, you know Sforza can neuer be a prisoner here, Conuey vs thither where we are no Prince. And must we wooe our Ruine? neuer man Is a true wretch, but when he loseth all, And wants the sad Election of his fall. Scena vltima. Iuliano, Picinino. Iul. I'me lost in this confusion: one reports We haue lost all; another instantly Kils all the French at once: thus eu'ry street Is filld with wondring people; some cry, Arme, Others runne crying, to perswade a flight: All haue an earnest businesse in the stirre, But in the helpe not any. Pic. These are they That if an happy messenger should come With Sforza's victory, would pretend at least To be orecome with ioy: the gorgeous wals Should shine with painted triumphs, and the French Should be againe vanquisht in pageant. But if his fortune yeeld to the French force, What obloquy's will be enough for him? Disgrace will then be wit, and any braine Will venture on a Libell. Iul. 'Tis the vse, The popular folly to admire euents, And those low soules thinke that the sword is iust, Proportioning the reason by the end Of the chiefe acts, of the best enterprize, And so by folly runne into a crime. Pic. No matter for their wisedome, were they good: O why are such term'd innocents? but friend, What is our ayme? a flight our age denyes, And whither should we flye, but to the graue? O I haue so much people in me too, Enter Maluezzo. That I could wish thy company. Mal. Good Heau'ns! Am I escap'd? may I stay safely here? My feare has left such neere impressions, I scarce dare thinke that this is Liberty. Pic. Noble Maluezzo, is there any hope? Mal. As much as in despaire: we are betraid, Sforza is made a prisoner, all's lost, And Millan, without blowes, is once more French. Pic. Now I remember what I dream't last night, (If it be safe to call a vision, Dreame,) I saw our Sforza in so pale a shape, That Enuy neuer was describ'd more wan, Who frighted me with this relation. Start not astonisht mortall: let no feare Chill thee to my pale image, but fixe here: Let thy once Prince be thy now spectacle, Whilst I the direst Tragedy shall tell That euer challeng'd wonder: briefly then, I was betraid, betraid, and by those men By whom I conquer'd:] tis an happy end To perish for, but neuer by a friend. This our first death: but thenâO could curst Time Dare euer such a Minute, such a Crime? Then was I pinion'd, then these royall hands Were forc'd obedient to the base commands Of an insulting Conqueror, and knit Vnto a hated vnion; t'were fit If euer Heau'n shed teares, then to distill Mournings Elixar, though th'expence should kill The hopes of after Ages: but Heau'n smil'd Nor any courteous clouds were wisely pil'd Ouer the Sunnes sharpe beame, but they gaz'd on With the same visage of compassion As did my torturers, [by whom I'me brought Vnto a place the which some shallower thought Has faintly term'd a prison, but to tell The truth of horror, t'was on Earth, an Hell: Darknesse so dwell there, that I might be wonne To wish the cruell comfort of the Sunne, Which earst I rau'd at: twas a narrow caue, Form'd to the modell of a lesser graue, Or straitned Coffin, all was length, for they Left not the height that I might kneele to pray. Was euer such a bed? could euer yet Cruelty boast of such a subtle wit To bury so! some that haue entred Earth Aliue, like me, yet by the vsuall mirth Of iustice had their buriall with meat, As if't should be their punishment to eate, From which Ime barr'd, I had no food, but me, And yet a guest of famine; Courtesie At last ceiz'd heau'n, I dy'd, and so though late, I both appeas'd and triumpht ouer Fate. But where am I? what extasie was this? Iul. How quickely we learne misery? no ghost Would haue so courteously relinquisht Hell To teach vs happinesse: if a kind starre Had cast a Fortune on vs beyond wish, We might expect the story from the starre Assoone as the deare benefit: but when griefe That against which we would seale vp our eares, When that is meant vs, we shall surely heare, Though heau'n doe straine for a new Miracle, So to amaze vs to a certainty: Though rotten carkasses regaine a voice, And hell is bounteous of intelligence, To giue vs teares. Pic. Why, then an end to teares, Let's scorne the sorrow, which we owe to hell: Now learne we the prodigious effects Of wise Ambition: for twere easie iustice To ruine foolish vsurpation, Heau'n needs not stickle in't: but when those men Who are as accurate, as bad, who can So shape their vice into a vertuous mould, That we repine at the accusers more, Then at the guilty: when that these men fall, Who then will call that wise, which he sees bad? Such wisdome made, and ruin'd him: then ye That dazzle with your Maiesty, and sit Too neere to thunder, and not feare it, know Sforza, and learne a wise contempt of wisedome, Frailty attends your best, and strongest tricke, And there's no foole vnto the Politicke.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue. Somewhat beyond an end? and can there be Tediousnesse counted an Apology? It was prolixity of speech offended, And can that error by more speech be mended? Your patience stints the wonder: that is it Hath dar'd vs to be publike, and to fit These times of tempest, with a blustring scene. If ought doe please, if we haue hit the meane, That neither cloyes the Auditor, nor starues, Felicity hath crown'd vs, if ought swarues From plausible inuention, know 'twas it Which we intend, which is in stead of wit. Teares grace a Tragedy, and we are glad To haue the happy power to make you sad, Continue it, and our applause is high, Not from your Hand so much, as from your eye.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Ambitious. Tell me, mortalls, if there be Ought beside stupidity Hidden in you at the least, If you are not all one beast Wherefore doe you cloud your face If you want the chiefest place? Why doe you respect? O why? Not how good 'tis, but how high? Would you all be Kings? Ã´ vaine, This is but to entertaine Such desires, that you may feare, Lest the heau'n should lend an eare, Lest you haue what you desir'd, And in your owne boggs be myr'd. Height is basenesse, if it be Leuel'd by Ãquality, And the Earth were a plaine still, If it were but one great hill. Would you all be Kings? as though Standing pooles should wish to flow, Or a riuer make his plea To exceed into a Sea: As if of the stars not one, But should striue to be the Sun, Or the Larke would partner be In the Eagles soueraignty. Would you not be mad to see, If a beast, a stone, a tree To the heau'nly powers ran Angry that they were not man? Nay in vs consider well To what Monsters we should swell, If but any Part should be Of the Mans infirmity. What should lead, or what be led, If the feet were made the Head? What should speake, or what should see, If this itch of Maiesty Made the mouth, for being nigh, Beg aduancement to the eye. Would you all be Kings, poore men! Wish, what you would wish agen, Which within your thoughts dares bide, And's not fearfull to be try'd. What's a King, consider well, But the publike Sentinell? But a Beacon, which we find Highly subiect to the wind? And can any still desire To be worse, so he be higher? Are you weary of your sleepe, Can you count it blisse, to creepe, To take paines vnto that height, Whence your fall may gaine a weight, Would you all be Kings? you may, Euery man hath regall sway, And 'tis this the fault does beare, Not that he commands, but where. Doe thy thoughts rebell? would Pride Haue thy worst acts magnifi'd? Does Ambition make thee flee To forbidden Sou'raignty. Know it is a brauer way To forbid, then to obey: Know it is a nobler deed, To giue ouer, then to speed. Were this all? would euery one But command himselfe alone, But command his owne desire, From the thought of rising higher: It would not be a griefe to see An vniuersall Monarchy. FINIS.</field>
