Diuers Philosophers auncient and sage, Their clargy and cunnynge to put in practise Oft haue disputed by learning and language To whome greatest honour men ought to demise Or for what cause, hie reuerence shoulde aryse, And amonges manye, some were there doubtlesse, That concluded honour due vnto ryches Some also to noble bloude, and high parayge Affirmed honour dewly to pertayne And some to policie and wysedome sage And some to power and superiall raigne, Eche man his reason sayde in certayne Ouer this some said, that vertuous demenoure To bee excellent, and of moste honour.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The kyng sitting in a chaire speaketh to his co?sell. Of these my lordes we woulde be glad to here, Which is most worthy honoure to attayne By your high reasons we thynke it maye appeare, To speake therefore we praye you, your sentences plaine And as ye determine, so shall wee certaine, Aduaunce to honoure, and to promotion applye Alwayes the best, and that bee most worthye. Primus generosus. Most drad soueraigne kinge Assuerus to your doughty weyghty and sured, The first g?tleman Of riches power, wisdome, vertue or noble bloude Vvhich is most soueraigne, and of highest honour Me seames as vertue none can be so good, Not ryches nor power, wisdome nor gentill bludde. For wher vertue fayleth, the other be not suer, But full vnstable, and longe cannot indure. who so wyll laboure storyes to peruse And them with dylligence, often will rede May see and perceue, how vice dyd confuse, Many noble princes whiche were in dede, Of such magnificence, that we not nede To doubt of theyre riches, power and wisdome, And yet for lacke of vertue, vice them ouer came. Secundus Generosus. Nabuchodonozor, Senacherib, and Salmanasar, Nero Dyoclisian Maxentius also, All these prynces of hye honoure were, Of ryches, power and wysdome allso Of noble bloode, yet these and many mo, For lacke of vertue, to vice dyd fall, To theyre owne distruction &amp; theyre subiectes all. Tertius Generosus. But then as me semeth, yt were expedyent, Amonge all vertues apperteyninge to a prince, That same to knowe by sume reason vrgente, which is so necessary to the prouince, That wythout yt in no wyse he can conuince, Neyther synne nor synners that vniustly deale, Nor in good order kepe his common weale, Primus Generosus. In myne opynion that is Iustice A vertu as excellent as may be. For all thinges it orderith in such wyse, That where it is, is peace and tranquillitie, Good order, hygh honour, wealth and plentye, And where it fayleth in the prince or kynge, The common weale decayeth withoute tariynge Secundus Generosus. Besyde Iustice there muste bee diligence, In hys owne personne that same to put in vre, Or els some tyme suche coloured sentence Vnder cloke of Iustice ye maye be sure Craftely shall procede from them that haue the cure which in processe, may brynge to downfall, The kynge, hys realme &amp; hys subiectes all. The iudgement of Salamon, in his owne person, Betwene two women of lyuinge vnchaste, So feared Israell that vtterlye noone Durste once rebell, but they thought it waste In anye wyse to attempt eyther fyrst or laste Any thynge of displeasure to hys maiestye royall Fearyng hys wysedome and Iustice so equall. Tertius Generosus. If by hys lieutenante had been done the same, Hys honoure shoulde neuer haue spronge so farre Nor so much renowned by noble fame, As it is now &amp; that both here &amp; there Nor yet hys subiectes to such awe and feare, He coulde haue dryuen by no meanes at all As he dyd by hys iustice personall And ouer thys many a noble man, At the prynces wyll and commaundymente, To employe iustice, dyd the best they can And yet the commons vnneth coulde be content And why? for in their mynde they thyncke verament That either for riches &amp; honour Iustis will doe And he onely, for the zeale that to Iustis he hath to Wherfore noble prince, if in youre owne person will ye Employe Iustis the more youre honour shallbe Kyng Assewerus My lordes we thanke you for youre counsell As ye haue sayed, so thinke we verely That Iustis mainteneth ye common weale, And namely ye prince muste nedes him selfe applye, Vnto the same, or els vtterly Shall folowe decay by warre or els death, QuoqÃ¾, si princeps malus populus coruet. And ouer this if that his lieutenaunt, Shal happen to square from trueth and iustice, Albeit his faire wordes and good semblaunt, The prince must nedes be circumspect and wise, That no ambicion nor couetise Through great welth and riches inordinat Doe erect his corage, for to play checkmate For though it be as well as it may neede, It shall be thought nay, I assure you in dede Sir what is your name and progeny? One of ye g?tyll m? must answere whyche you will Aman. I am Aman sonne of Amadathy, Of the stocke of Agag borne lyniallye, Assuerus. your learnyng and reason pleaseth vs well And ye seeme to be of discretion we beare ye therfore our fauour and zeale So that withoute meanes of intercession we make you our chaunceloure, take hede to this lesson. See ye doe iustice and trueth euer approue Or to your destruction, we shall you soone remoue Aman My duty is more nowe then euer it was, Truly to serue youre moste noble grace, Both nyghte &amp; day, here and in euery place. Assewerus (et exeat) My lordes as nowe, thus standes the case, we are comfortles, for lacke of a Queene, which shoulde be our ioye, &amp; chefe solace, And to say truth, it hath not been oft seene, But the prince with a princes matched hath beene Leaste defaulte of issue shoulde be, whiche God defende therfore youre counsells firste had, to marry we do int?d Primus generosus. Then let your officers peruse this realme, And of fayre maidens that be virgins pure, Of most goodly personages that may be sene Gather a great number, that we may make reporte Vnto your grace, then may ye be sure To chose the beste, when ye haue them seene And that is fittest to be your quene. Assewerus Call to vs Aman our trusty chaunceler. Here entrith Am? with m?y m? await?g on hym. Aman. If it please your grace I am here, Assuerus. Aman this is the councel of my lordes all, That our officers in hast we shoulde sende To pervse this region vdiuersall From the begynnynge vnto the ende To seke faire maidens, where so thei may be kende And of most goodly personages that maye be sene To the intent among them we may chose a quene This is our minde, more to speake it shal not nede, In all that ye may, see it bee done in dede. Here the kynge entryth the trauers &amp; aman goeth out. Here entreth Mardocheus and a maiden with him. I am Mardocheus borne in Ierusalem, The sonne of Iaire, and of the stocke of Beniamy By Nabuchodonosor brought into this realme when he did subdue our kyng Iechony And translated the Iewes by conquest and victorye Both I and other in number many one were brought in captitiuitie, into the realme of Babilon I haue here a maiden of the same nacion My brothers doughter named Edissa But Hester is her common denomination And by that well knowen, nam a deo missa God graunt her grace, that perseuer she maye, In wisedome and womanhead faythfull to bee Her espouse to loue in perfecte amitie. So is it nowe oure kynge Assuerus, Dyuers Purseuauntes in great haste hathe sente, Ouer all hys realme in these parties nere vs, To seeke faire maidens is his entent To chose amonge theym one conuenyente, To bee his quene and Lady Soueraigne, In loue and honour with him for to raigne. And for as muche doughter Hester that you Amonge other are appoynted for one, I thyncke it accordynge therefore nowe, To giue you mine aduise and instruction, Attende ye therfore without interruption And by faithfull mind, and stedfast memorye That I shall saye, learne it diligentlye. Hester. Noble Mardocheus my father moste kynde, To that ye shall saye I wyll applye my mynde. Mardocheus. Than yf the kinge chose you to his queene It is of hys goodnes, bountie and grace And for none youre merites, the truthe to bee seene Therefore to hym repaye muste you needes obedience Trew loue and kyndnes, aboue personnes all Not forged nor fayned, but with affection cordiall. Breake not the course that queenes haue hadde In this noble region most part of all, They haue aye bene good, and none of theym badde, To their prince euer sure, iust and substanciall And good to the commons when they dyd call By mekenes for mercye, to temper the fyre Of rigors iustice in fume or in yre Hester. Thys counsell is perfecte and also so pure I graunt it therfore, and promyse you sure It is my whole mynde and hartye desyre That same to fulfyll, as reason shall requyre. Here entrith pursiuante with manye maydens. Purseuaunt. I haue here of maydens a fayre companye Of comlye stature and goodly visage which to the king I thynke by and by For to present, and to hys counsell sage, For their promotion, wealth and marriage, Saue before wyth Mardocheus the Iew, I muste speake for Hester, that is so fayre of hew. Mardocheus. She is here redy, and doth attende, The kynges commaundiment to fullfyll, And at youre pleasure forth shall she wende, wyth out resystance, and by her good wyll. Pursyuaunt. Then shall I brynge her the kynge vntyll. Come on lady Hester, and followe me To the kynge shall ye goe with youre cumpany. Here Aman metythe th? in ye place Aman. Syr pursiuaunt haue ye these maydens broughte, For the kynge lyke as ye had in commaundement. Pursyuaunte yea syr and for them, farre haue I soughte, Both in vyllage towne and tenemente, I truste I haue done trew seruice and dylligente. Aman So are ye bounde by very dewty Of youre allegeaunce and fydelytye, Se that ye follow vs wyth youre hole cumpany. Pursyuaunt. As ye haue sayed so shall it be. Aman. Pleasyth it youre grace, accordynge your mynde we haue made serche all youre regyon, For goodly maydens of nature fyne and kynde, Th? thei go to the kynge. And of them haue founde in myne opynyon A number ryght fayre and of complexion So puer and of so fayre visage. That they surmounte all other in personage. Assuerus. Are they also of suche competent age Of suche demeanour and grauitie, That they be fytte for oure mariage. Aman. Vppon a profe youre grace shall heare and see, As well theyr wysedome as theyr beautye. Assuerus. Sertis they be fayre and goodly eche one, And as it maye seme by theyr fyrst countenaunce Both by looke and gesture, nature and complexion, In theym shoulde be kyndnes, myrth, and dalyaunce wysedome, sadnes, and in loue perseueraunce, Constauncie knit wyth comlines, ioy to encrease Vertue with good demenour, pleasure to put in presse. But ye fayre damsell of the highest stature, And of most ripe age, as shoulde seame Of all this companye of most fynest nature. Tell vs your linage, for as yet we deame, your lookes be so lusty, and in loue so breme If that your demenour hereafter be sene To that accordynge, ye shalbe our quene. Hester. Moste noble Prince as for my linage, Nor yet my countrey, sertis I can not saye My parentes dicessed in myne none age, So that I neuer harde yet vnto thys daye what coste or countrey, what lande or laye, I was bred in, broughte forth or borne, It is to me vnknowen, as aye hath bene beforne, Notwithstandyng, I haue had foode and fostring Of Mardocheus all my lyfe dayes, whom I called father in my yonge age, And so intend to do eftsons and alwaies, whome for his frendshippe I haue good cause to prayse, Besechinge youre grace and that moste mekely, To my sayd foster father good lorde for to be Assewerus Call in Mardocheus, that we may see his face. Mardocheus. I am here to attende vpon youre grace. Assewerus Mardocheus what call you, youre daughter. Mardocheus. If it please youre grace her name is Hester Assuringe you, she is a virgin puer, A pearle vndefiled and of conscience cleare Sober, sad, ientill, meke and demure, In learninge and litterature, profoundely seene, In wisdome, eke semblante to Saba the Quene Fytt for any prince to haue in marriage, If his pleasure agree to her personage, Assewerus. ye say ryghte well, then we thynke it expedient, Some what to proue by communication Her lernynge and her language eloquent And by some probleme of hye dubitation, To knowe her aunswere and consultation Howe saye you Hester haue you ought reade or seene Of vertues that be best, and fittest for a queene. Hester. To speake before a king, it is no childes playe, Therfore I aske pardon, of that I shall saye Assuerus. We pardone you what soeuer ye saye, Hester. Then to bee bolde ryghte well I maye No quene there is, but by marriage of a prince, And vnder couert according to the lawe, So that the iurisdiction of the whole prouince, To the kynge perteineth this is the trewe sawe Albeit, sometyme more for loue than for awe The king is content to bee counselled by the queene, In many sundrye causes, as ofte hath been seene, which sentence is sure and grounded with reason, But yet not wythstandynge this is not all But eftsons it may chaunce at sundrye season The kynge wyth hys councell most parte of all From this realme to be absente, when warre doth call. Then the Quenes wysdome, sadly muste deale, By her greate vertue, to rewle the common weale. Wherfore as many vertues be there muste, Euen in the Quene as in the prynce, For feare lest in warre, sume treason vniust, The realme shoulde subdewe, and falsely conuince. The Quene muste sauegarde all the hole prouince, And so as muche goodnes aye muste be seene, As in the kynge to be in the Quene, And how many vertues longe to a kynge, Lyke vnto youre grace I cannot make recknynge. Assewerus. Then I doute not, but the wysdome of vs two Knytte both to gether in parfytte charyte All thynges in thys realme shall cumpas so, By truth and Iustice, law and equitye, That we shall quenche all vice and deformitie Hester. Then at my beginning I beseche youre grace That I may shew my mynd, whyle I haue time &amp; space Assuerus. Speake at your libertie, I wyll heare it gladlye. Hester. Then I wyl be playne, for veritie hath no pere And for a pryncipall of thys my tale, And eke his subiectes both greate and smale, In honoure and wealth: yea, all the prouince, So riche and so stronge, that they maye conuince All their enemyes where so euer they dwell, That woulde inuade, resiste, or rebell, And where goddes seruyce and hospitalitie Doeth decaye, and almes to the poorall, There maye be wealth in places two or three But I assure you the most part in generall, Neither haue meate nor money, nor streugth substancial Fytte to doe you seruice, when ye haue nede whiche is no good order, me thynkes in very dede Let God alwaye therfore haue hys parte And the poore fedde by hospitalitie Eche man his measure, be it pynte or quarte, And no man to muche, for that is great ieoberdie, A meane to lose all, as I doe feare me, For when all is gathered to gether on a heape It may sone be conueyed cariage is good cheape, Thys I speake with trew heart and mynde, Besechyng your grace to take it in good kynde. Assuerus. Of these matters another tyme moore at large, We shall speake, and of dyuers other mo. Aman, see our seruauntes doe accomplishe their charge, To awayte vpon oure Queene, and that also In haste vnto oure waredrobe see ye goe, For riche apparell of golde and pall As well for her selfe, as for her ladyes all, Aman. Than if it please you to licence the Queene, As to her pleasure awhyle shall beseeme Here departith ye queene &amp; Aman &amp; all ye maidens. Assuerus. And we for a season thys busynesse wyll cease, And oure selfe repose for our pleasure and ease. Here entreth Pride syngynge poorely arayed. To men that be heuy, &amp; wold faine be mery Though they feele smarte: Of ch?ce such rekning, yt with their mouth thei sing, Though thei wepe in their hart. somtime thei da?ce, with mery co?tena?ce, when they had leuer slepe: Eke thei laugh &amp; grin, wh? by this sunne I wyn In the heart they wepe. who so will accord, with this double world Muste vse suche artes: Outwardly kinde, in his heart a fende, A knaue in two partes. Outward honestie, inward infidelitie, Bothe rydes on a mule: In peace he is bolde, but in war he is colde, That soouest wyll recoyle. Manye bee that profers, but fewe that offers, Deuoutelye in theyr hearte: They saye they can doe all, but when neede doeth befall, They begynne to starte. He that is double, loues alwaye trouble, And at no tyme wyll cease: And yet he wyll not fight, by daye nor yet by nyghte, In warre nor in peace. But such men by battail, may get corne and cattell Bullyon and plate: And yf they once get it, let vs no moore craue it, By GOD we comme to late. Eyther to begge or borowe, except shame or sorowe, Dyspleasure and hate. Syrs my name is pryde, but I haue layde asyde, All my goodlye araye: ye wynne I lye, there is a cause why, That I goe not gaye. I tell you at a worde, Aman that newe lorde, Hathe bought vp all goood clothe, And hath as many gownes, as would serue ten townes Be ye neuer so lothe: And any manne in the towne, doe by him a good gowne, He is verye wrothe. And wyll hym strayte tell, the statute of apparell, Shall teache hym good: wherefore by thys daye, I dare not goe gaye Threde bare is my hoode. Pryde was wonte to be, a man of iolytye, Of hye countenaunce and face: And since Aman raygned, no man hym retayned, Allmoste in any place. For Aman that elfe, woulde no man but hym selfe, Shoulde be proude in dede. For as men say, all pryde he taketh away, well, God sende him good spede. Adulation. And as for Adulation, must chaunge his occupation It is not worth a pease. Pryde. why so? Adulation. For my lorde Aman, doeth al that he can I assure you without doubt: To take vp al flatteres, &amp; al crafty clatterers That dwell fourtye myle aboute. Pryde. yea but the lawe shal, byorder substnacial, Punyshe all those: Adulation. yea, I wil tel you one thing, law now &amp; flatteryng Aye together gose. Pryde. why so? Adulation. For al law est &amp; west, &amp; adulation in his chest Aman hathe locked faste: And by his crafti patter?g, hath turned law into flattering, So that fyrst and laste, The cliant must pay, or the lawyer assaye The lawe for to clatter: And wh? ye wene he saide right, I assure you by this light He doth not els but flatter. Pride. why so? Adulation. For yf Aman wynkes, the lawyers shrynckes, And not dare saye yea nor naye. And yf he speake the lawe, the other calles hym daw No more then dare he say. So that was law yisterday, is no lawe thys daye, But flatterynge lasteth alway, ye may me beleue. Pryde. Dyuines yt do preache, me thynkes they should teache And flatterynge reproue. Adulation. Syr they haue lefte prechyng, &amp; take them to flatter?ge Moste parte of them all. Pryde. I marueyle of that. Adulation. Do ye maeueyle? mary I wyll you tell, A cause substantiall. when they preached, and the truthe teached, Sume of them caughte a knocke, And they yt should assisted, I wote not how they were brysted, But they dyd nothynge but mocke. And that sawe they, and gate them away, As faste as myghte be. They solde theyr woll, and purchased a bull, wyth a pluralyte. And lefte predication, and toke adulation, And what by mendation, and dyspensation, They gat the nomynation, of euery good benefyce. So better by flatterynge, then by preachynge, To wealthe they dyd aryse. But yet ye muste beware. Pryde. where of? Adulation. That they do not square, farre beyonde the marke For yf yt be a good fee, Aman sayeth that longeth to me Be yt benefyce or parke If he espy to yt pr?oti?, he wyll streyt geue him a porti? A lappe of a thowsande markes, He shalbe purged cleane, he shall singe neither treble nor meane, Nor yet speake one worde. Pride. Is he well seene in adulation? Adulation. He is ward? of ye occupati?, without all iest?ge boorde And no man so hardy, but by hys auctorite, The same to vse. Here entryth Ambytion. No, for yf he doe, he were better no, Hys braynes he wyll confewse. Pride. Why who arte thow? Ambytion. He that can tell how, Aman vseth to wurke. Pride. Is not Ambytion thy name? Ambytion. yes for god ye same, I was wonte to be a great clarke But syn Aman bare rewle, neyther horse nor mule, But ys as wyse as I Adulation. How so? Ambytion. For all rewlers &amp; lawes, were made by fooles &amp; dawes He sayeth verely. Ordynances &amp; foundation, without consyderation, He sayeth were deuysed. Therfore hys imagination, bringes all out of fashion And so all is dysguised. Sum tyme where was plenty, now ye barnes be empti And many men lackes bread. And wher somtyme was meat, there now is none to get But all be gone and dead. Beggers now do banne, and crye out of Aman, That euer he was borne. They swere by the roode, he eatyth vp all their foode, So that they gett no good, neyther euen nor morne. And many that be pore, though not from doore to doore A begginge they dyd goe: yet had they releefe, bothe of breade and beefe, And dryncke also. And nowe the dore standes shet, and no man can we get, To worcke neither to fyghte. wherefore yf warre should chaunce, eyther wyth Scotland or Fraunce, Thys geare woulde not goe ryght. Adulation. And where is all this become? Ambition. As for yt domin? vobisc?, I dare say nothinge but m?, Not tyll an other tyme. Pryde. All this is out of season, and nothing done by reason, Nor yet by good ryme. Adulation. How say you ambition, haue ye not prouision, for to get promotion, as ye were wonte to do? Ambition. No by my holydame, for my lorde Aman Handelles all thynge so, That euery office and fee, what so euer it bee, That maye bee sene and founde: By his wit he wyl it featche, and or it fal he wil it catche That neuer commeth to the grounde. So that I repent, that euer I went, Vnto the scoles: For his large commission, maketh me Ambition To dwell amonge fooles. Pryde. And is there no remedye? Adulation. None that I can spye, whyle he doeth raygne. Ambition. Then lette vs make merye, euen tyll we dye, And dryue pyne awaye: Pryde. I hearde once a Fryer, as trewe a lyer, As anye in the countrey: Hee preached veramente, that oure testamente, Alwaye readye shoulde bee. Adulation. For at oure deathe, we shall lacke breathe, And than fare well wee. Ambition. Then mayster Pryde, begynne thys tyde, Let vs here youre fashion. adulation. and ye shall here nexte, euen the playne texte, Of me adulation Pryde. Then by and by, ye shall heare playnely, wythout impedimente, The tenour of my wyll, if ye take heede therevntyll This is my testament. Al my presumptuous pryde, whether he goe or ryde, Nowe or elles than: My heart and corage, for power and language I geue it vnto Aman. Let him kepe of my pryde what he wil, the reste deulde, amonge hys whole Garde: and when they haue it all, what they wyll dooe withall, aduyce them afterwarde. If pryde haue a fall, let them be content withall as I am nowe: For as for Pryde, lasteth but a tyde, I assure you. If to it longe shame, let them a goddes name, Take them bothe: For as I feare mee, so muste it needes bee, Bee they neuer so lothe. Adulation. and I adulation, of the same fashion, at thys tyme present, To recorde euerye man, geue vnto aman, By thys my testament. All my subteltie, &amp; forged fydelite, To hym and hys espyes. I wot they wyll it vse, trew men to confewse, And that craftely. And yf they do in dede, I pray god they may spede, Euen as honestly, As he that from steylyng, goth to sent thomas watryng In his yong age. So they from pytter pattour, may cume to tytter totur Euen the same pylgrimage. Ambition. And I Ambytion, had a comission, By force of a bull, To gett what I could but not as I wolde, Neyther of lambe nor woll. Th? bull nor the calfe, coulde please the one halfe, Of my feruente desire. But euer I thought by god, there was I woulde haue had when I was neuer the nere. Therfore all my ambition, to gether in a comission, Vnder my seale, I geue it to aman, to the intent that Sathau, Maye loue hym well: That whyle he is here, he maye styll desyre, and yet neuer the nere: Sometyme to bee, and when he goeth hence, he maye with him dispence, By a large facultye. That for his sines seuen, or he come to heauen, wyth out bourde or game. Sumtyme or tyde, he may for his pryde, Suffer some shame. Pride. Nowe by wades myll, euerye mans wyll Is wonderouslye well: Adulation. And by my holydome, I wene it be wysedome, For folke often chat, howe men dye in estate, But so shall not wee: Ambition. No by sainct An, but yet my Lorde Aman, Neuer the better shalbe: Pryde. No forse so god me saue, yf we our wyll myght haue we woulde he shoulde neuer thee. Nowe made is our testament, I praye you be content Some myrthe to deuyse. Adulation. Let vs beginne with singynge, and conclude with drinkynge, It is the newe gyse: Ambition. Then let vs beginne a songe, that wyl last euen as long As hence to the tauerne dore. (Et exeunt.) Thei depart singyng, and Aman entreth. Aman. Moste noble prynce, and of highest wysedome I do not doubte of youre considartion, But that you know what I haue bene, eke what I am, Bothe in wyll and woorde, and occupation, Of assured thoughte without adulation, And as glad to doe seruice vnto your grace As euer I was to liue anye tyme or space. And for the same great malice I do sustayne, Both of your nobles and communaltie To my greate greuaunce and merueylous payne, And eke further, I feare the ieoperdye Of my lyfe, goodes, credence and honestie, To cease their malyce, vnlesse you put in vre your power royall, I can not longe endure. The scla?derous reportes, the lyes yt be made The fained dectractions and contumilious The rimes the railinges, so farre sette abrode Both payntyd and printyd in moste shamefull wyse And god to recorde all is but leasinges and lyes. was neuer made on man lyke as is on me Only for aplyment of law and equite. In so much that of late now in dede Before all the commins vpon myne and me, Moste d?nable reportes ware sett a brode, To my dyshonour and shamefull villany, And all that were there of that c?panye, As I myghte see by theyre countenaunce and voice, That same alowed and greatly dyd reioyce wherfore noble prince I beseche youre grace, Let me be remoued another to haue my place Assuerus. Aman we harde wyth deliberation, Vttered and pronounsed by language cleane, A very elygante and prudente oracion Of you as euer to fore was seene By whose tenour we knowe what ye meane, And haue ye no doughte so shall we for you prouide That youre enemies shall domage you on no syde. we knowe ryght well the wordes enuious to be One agaynste an other for fee and office But that to regarde in no wyse nede ye, As longe as ye obserue trueth and iustyce, From the which we woulde that in no wyse ye shoulde degresse for if ye do in dede, youre owne distruction shortly ye shall brede, But for youre comforte harke what I shall tell, And for more assistance in this that ye do feare, we make you lieutenaunte to rewle Israell, Take heare these robes see ye do them weare, Eke this golden wande in youre hande to beare, A token of honour and of estate ryall, God sende you contynuaunce and well to do with all, Aman. Noble prynce accordinge as I am bounde, I will do you seruice tyll deathe me confounde, Assuerus. For a season we wyll to our solace Into our orcharde or some other place, Here the kynge entreth the trauerse &amp; Hardy dardy entreth the place. Hardydardy. A prouerbe as men say a dogge hath a day, when so euer that it chaunce He that wyll drinke wine and hath neuer a vine, Muste sende or goe to fraunce. And yf he do not, endure he cannot, He muste nedes shrynke, Shrinke yea say that againe, for it is a greate paine, To be with out drynke. In such case am I, I swere by goddes pety, I lacke both drynke and meate. But as I say, a dogge hath a day, For now I truste to get. My tyme is come for to get some, If I be not lett. It is the common worde Aman is a lorde. And Aman is of price, And hath perdye all this cuntrie At his rwele and deuice. And I trust to be one of his yemanry, To weare his bage and marke. An office I wold beare and it noughte elles wheare, But the keper of his parke. Aman. Me seames ye are not fytte. Hardy dardy. ye wene I lacke wytte it may well be so, yet afole when it doth happe may somtyme chaunce to stoppe a gappe when wyse men wyll not mell. Aman. Fooles largely will bourde and tell al theyr thought. Hardy dardy. And wyse men well not speke one worde till all become to nought Aman. Fooles will tell all and that trobleth sore, Hardy dardy. And wyse men will say nought at al till al be gone &amp; more Aman. Fooles to Idlenes all wayes be preste. Hardy dardy. And wyse men vse such busines it were better they were at rest Aman. Fooles let the reformation, of common wele. Hardy dardy. And wyse men be so full of imaginacion, they wot not how they deale. Aman. whyse men wolde do ryght, And foles say nay. Hardydardy. And fooles be fayne to fyght when wise men r?ne away Aman. Fooles spend all tyll they haue nought Hardydardy. And wise men carry all tyll they dare no more craue. Aman. ye are a foole ye do but clatter. Hardydardye. Many go to scole tyll they can flatter Aman. Leaue youre clatter, leste ye cume tardy. Hardydardy. It makes no matter for my name is Hardydardy Aman. Is youre name Hardydardy. Hardydardy. yea yt is it verily, I wold if it plese ye, Be one of your yomanrie. Aman. As for that let it passe we take you for our solace. And mirthe sumtime to ken. Hardydardy.

Some wise man muste be fayn sumtime to take ye paine To do on a fooles cote. And than perchaunce it is not redie. Aman. well ye can speake merely wherwith I am contente Sirs tarrie you a seasone se that farre ye not walke, I will to the kinge secretly to talke. Moste victorius prince &amp; of higheste honour Primate of the worlde and president chefe, By whose wisedome and pollityke demeanoure, All the worlde at this day takes relefe, Both kynge page and lorde yea in sentence brefe, No realme nor region able were to stande, Onles your councell with them be at hande. who compelleth lordes to mainteine their nobilite, who lerneth knyghtes theyr feates marciall. Or who religion subdewith to humilite, who haue craftes and laborers the worlde ouer all, In ciuill cytie or village ryall. Compelleth eche man to hys order and place, But only the wisedome and polyce of your grace, your strength defendith your wisdome saueth all, youre plentye releuithe almoste euery man Such is your honour and order ryall That none other councell at this day canne, Reache nor attaine to know how or whan, Lyke good order or honorable guise, As you by wisdume dayly do device, So is it your grace from very base parage, And poore estate me to hye honour haue brought, For none my vertues nor wisdome sage, But onely youre gooddes haue made me of nought, God is mi iudge it is ther fore mi thoughte, And dayly study aboue all worldly treasure That thing to do, that is your wealth and plasure. And yf it please your grace therfore to here, One thynge as I shall make rehersall, whan I haue saide I thinke it shall apeare, To your pleasure and proffitte substanciall, And to be playne this is it fyrste of all. A greate number of Iewes with in this realm do dwell A people not goode, nor for youre common weale, They be dispersed ouer all youre prouince, with in them selfe dwellyng, deseuered from our nation, By theyr new lawes they think to conuince, And eke draw vnto theyr conuersation, And vnto theyr ceremonyes and faction Of our people as many as may be, Intendyng to sub dew all gentilite, More ouer the preceptes of your law, They refuse and haue in great contempte They wyll in no wise liue vnder awe, Of any prince but they wil be exempte, wherby good order may sone be interempte, And occasion is as I do feare me your subiectes to rebell in hope of lyke liberte. And youre grace knoweth it is expediente, Theyre mallyce to increase thus by sufferaunce, For by that may chaunce greate inconuenience, And to all your realme importune perturbaunce, For theyre possessions be of substaunce So greate and so large that I feare at the length, They wyll attempte to subdewe you by strengthe. My councell therfore to auoide ieoperdy, If that your grace by your power ryall, Shall geue sentence and plainly decree, To slea these Iewes in your realme ouer all, None to escape let your sentence be generall, ye shall by that wynne to say I dare be bolde, To your treasure .x. thousande pound of golde, Assuerus. My lorde Aman we haue harde ryght well, All your oration which is so elegante, And so well towched that nedes we muste fele, And perceyue your minde your wordes be so pregnante, And as touchinge the Iewes which be so valiaunte, Both of goodes and greate pocession, we do agree vnto theyre suppression. we ryghte well perceiue that vnto them drawe, Much of our people and ientile nation, which to our honour and also to our lawe Muste nedes be a greate derogation, A meane to bringe all out of facion To quenche them therefore we be contented well, In token wherof holde here a ringe and seale. Aman. Of your sentence there shall not lacke one clause, But all shall be done and that without pause, The Pursiuauntes call to vs shortely. Pursyuauntes. If it lyke you we are here. Aman. These letters deuised we wolde ye shoulde aplye, To bere furth and that dylligently, with as much haste as may be, To the rewlers of euery towne and citie, Streightly commaunding theim all that they maye The same to execute at their prefixed day. Purseuaunt. To his hye pleasure we shall make vs preste, And tyll it bee done, we wyll take no reste, Aman. We be glad we haue attained our purpose, I trust it shall abate the hie corage Of Mardocheus, and eke all those That be hys clyantes brynge to repentaunce: Hardydardye. Mary syr they be lyke to take penaunce, It woulde greue any man yonge or olde of age without his head to goe on pylgrimage Aman. Thei haue deserued it, and they shall haue it, It is for theym accordynge: Hardydardye. If I shoulde bewray, that some men doe saye, It were a mad bourdynge. Aman. Say what ye lyste. Hardydardy. So woulde I, yf wiste ye wolude not angrye Aman. ye haue libertie, as ye pleased be, To stande or tumble: Hardydardy. Men say in dede, ye shall lose your head, And that woulde make you stumble. Aman. why so? Hardardy. Thei say it is conuenient, should be fulfilled ye testament Of Ambition, Adulation and Pride: They gaue you all their pryde and flatterynge, And after that saint thomas watring there to rest a tide And men thynke at hoste, with them was the holy ghoste, Theyre testament was made so holily, wherfore all that they sayed cannot be take or sayed, But as a prophesie. Aman. well ye are verely, disposed merely, Now for to talke. And I am suerly minded secretely, For my solace to walke. Et exeat. Here entreth a Iew and speaketh. O lorde what a thinge is crudelite, whan to it is annexed couetous and Pride, It distroyeth both towne and contrey Eke all regions on euery syde, All is for him to lyttell his mouthe is so wide, His rigour rauenous spares not to spill, Both man and chylde to haue his owne will: This rauenous wolfe Aman I do meane, That hath perswaded the kynge to kill and slea, And from all this prouince to auoid cleane, All men and women and children that be, Iewes borne and of the Iewes consanguinite, The precept is set vp men to remember And it shalbe executed the .xiii. day of December, Alas that euer shoulde fortune suche rage, From so cankered a caytyfe to procede, It is his mynde my head I ley to gage, All those to sley, I assure you in deede That wyll not by flattery hys presumptions fede, He woulde be glorified aboue creatures all, And yet I trust as Lucifer depe he shal fal. Another Iewe. The Mantuans thought it a greate punishmente, To be proscribed from theyre goodes and lande, As reciteth Virgill that Poet eloquente, Much more is our payne ye may vnderstande, That shall lose our lyues vnles god take in hande, Vs to delyuer or els we not canne, Auoide the murder of this carnifex Aman: An other Iew. He shall by this murder our goodes wynne, And him selfe enlarge his pride to auaunce, And when he hath all he shall be new to begynne, Euer more to gett by some other chaunce. Mardocheus. yet at the laste all shall cume to mischaunce, For both him and his god shall make tame, And for theyre pride and pyllage, sende them worldly shame: Hester. Mardocheus wyth youre cumpanye, we haue harde youre lamentation, To our grefe and displeasure verely, yet we truste by meke supplication, Fyrste vnto god by humble oration Aud than to the king by desyre cordyall A meane to fynde, for to sauegarde ye all Call in the chapell to the intent they maye Syng some holy himpne to spede vs this day than the chappell do singe. After this prayer and our former abstynens To the good Lorde I call for cumforte To inspyre the prynce, &amp; his mynd incence That I may optayne now at my resorte To redeme the Iewes, all the hole sorte Eke to dysclose the falsed fauell and fraude. Of this cruell Aman to thy prayse &amp; laude Assuerus.

Lady Hester our moste beloued Quene, So pewer and so exauisite is thys repaste, Both of wine and meate that no better may beene, Here must bee prepared a banket in ye place youre mirth eke and manners so pleasaunte to attaste, That for to departe we make no maner haste, Eke our presence we knowe is to youre pleasure, Farre better than golde or any worldly treasure. wherfore as we sayde we wolde ye shoulde demande And at your pleasure, your petition make The one halfe of our reame, yf ye it cummaund we shall with departe, only for your sake and of it to you, a playne surender make and the more ye aske, wyth louinge intente the more we shall geue, and the better be contente Hester. Noble prynce your hye magnyficens your bounte, and espieciall grace So ofte and so kyndlye doeth incense, To make request som profite to purchase, So yt lenger delay were in me great trespase, and by yt also your grace right wel may it thinke That finally your loue vnto my heart did sinke. Wherfore this fauoure sence I haue obtayned Of your grace to haue any my requeste This I do aske with true harte vnfayned and wyth charitie, of all vertues best, That throw all your reame both east and west As manye as bee of the Iewyshe nation, your grace wil them pardon at my supplication Assurynge you I am of that nacion, Borne and eke brede in Ierusalem, yet I and all they by one condempnation, To deathe are determined throughe all this realme, No remedy: lesse your pardon vs redeme, we woulde rather we myght be solde in bondage, Than thus to peryshe, by fury and outrage Assuerus. what is he, or what is hys authoritie, That is so bolde thys acte to attempt? Hester. It is Aman that by cruell enuy Is oure mortall enymye and wold vs enterrupt That our lyfe and godes from vs were adempte Then wold he rule all and if he myght to all get And all shoulde not suffice, so hie his heart is set. Hys pompe and his pryde, so muche is in dede, That yf he had all, it coulde him not suffice, At thys tyme hys treasure youres doeth execede, And yet content is he in no wyse, But to gette moore daylye he doeth deuise, The commons he extorteth tyll they bee lame He takes the profyt and ye beare the name. But better it were that he shulde suffer payne Than thus by crafte, your honour to dystaine By his false leasinges, he putteth other in blame Deludinge youre grace, when he lyst to fayne And no man so worthy for to suffer payne, As he him selfe that by hys poyson and gall, Hath deceyued you, and eke youre commons all. Assuerus. He signified vnto me that the Iewes did Not feede the poore by hospitalitie Their possessions he sayde, were all but hydde, Amonge them selues lyuyng voluptuouslye, Thinkyng the same might be verely, Much better employed for the common weale, where now it litle profitteth or neuer a deale. Hester. Noble prince as for hospitalitye. Of the Iewes dwellinge in your regyon It is with them as alwayes hath bene Sins the beginning oftheir possession which god to them gaue, of his mere mocion, Eke great knowledge both of cattell and of grayne That none to them like houshold coulde maintayne, Is not of Abraham the hospytallyte, In scripture noted and of noble fame, But one honoringe when he receiued three, The trenite fygured in the same, Both Isaake and Iacob had a lyke name, Of whom the twelue tribes descended be, which euer dyd maintaine hospitallyte. Sinse god therfore hath begunne theyre housholde. And ay hath preserued theyre hospitallite, I aduise noman to be so bolde, The same to dissolue what so euer he be, Let God alone for he shall orderly, A fine ad finem, both here and there Omnia disponere suauiter. Assuerus. O kaytiffe moste crafty o false dissembler, with thy flatteringe tonge thou haste deceyued me, All noble princes by me may be ware, whom they shall truste and put in auctorite, Eke whom they shall promote to ryches and dignite. But we shall teache the good for thine ingratitude, And by the all other theyre prince to delude. Aman. O lady Hester moste noble princesse, Of thine honour and goodnes soueraine, Extende to me that pitie or els doutles, To deathe I am dressed and mortall payne, I wotte I haue deserued it for certaine, And againste the my offence is great, wherefore vneth I dare thy goodnesse entreate, But trueth is, the merite of thys is better And God it more accepteth a thousande fold Agaynst whome the offence is greater And of them that of iniurie coulde not tell me wherefore to speake somewhat it makes me bolde To encrease thy merite and rewarde heauenlye Saue my life and I thy seruaunte shall be. Hester. Aman this matter so heinous is in dede That of our honour we wyll nother speake nor speede Aman. Alas then am I vtterlye marred I must streighte die it can not be deferred. Assuerus. O thou kaytyffe canste thou not be contente, with the mischeffe by the done before, But the quene wylt oppresse, we beinge presente what nede we call for euidence moore Make him sure and fast and therto bind him sore we will that oure counsell shortlye deuice, How we shalbe bestow him accordynge to iustice Arbona. There is in the house of thys traitour Aman A paire of galowes of fiftie cubites hie Vp? them he had thought either now or than To haue caused Mardocheus to die. Assuerus. Leade him hence, and vpon them by and by See that ye hange him, and so stoppe his breathe without fauoure see he suffer deathe. Hardydardye. Other folkes be tardye, as wel as hardy dardy By this reckeninge A syr besyde belles, bacon and somewhat els, Must nedes haue hanginge. Assewerus. Hanginge doe serue, when they that deserue, Are false feytoures Hardy dardy. And it commes to lottes, of heringes and sprottes which be no traytours To hange in the smoke, til they chaunge their cloke From white to redde. Assewerus. But such do no wronge, wherfore they do not honge Tyl they be ded. Hardy dardy. ye speake somwhat like, for it toucheth the quicke To be hanged in good heale Assewerus. yet none nede to care, that is wyse and ware And truly wyll deale Hardydardy Haue ye not rede, of Naso Ouide, That eloquent Poet, Nor Valery, which telles merely, The proper feates, How the smith Perillus, like a tuta vilus Made a bull of bras He had thought iwis, to haue pleased king Phalaris But yet he did much wurse, Assuerus. why so? Hardydardye. I wene by god he made a rodde, For his owne ars, Phalaris coulde not get with in the bull to shett, Lo here beginnes the game, wherefore in dede he toke for nede, Perillus maker of the same. In he did him turne and made the fier to burne And greatly to increase, He cast him in such heate and eke in such sweate, He fried him in his greace, Assewerus. what meane you by this. Hardydardy. I wyll tell you by gis my hole intencion. I meane my master is the fyrste taster, Of his owne inuencion. The gallhouse he made both hye and brode, For Mardocheus he them mente, And now he is faine him selfe for certaine, To play the fyrste pagente. Assuerus. He that deserues payne is worthy certaine, Euen for to haue it. Hardydardy. Therfore god sende all those, that will steale mens clothes, That once they may goe naked. Arbona. If it please your grace this traitoure Aman, we haue put to deathe as was youre cummaundyment. Assuerus. Then shall we streighte as well as we canne, Bestowe his goodes for he made no testamente. Lady hester this is our intent The house of Aman with all his treasure, we geue it you, do with all youre pleasure. Hester. I thanke your grace with harte entyre, Nowe dare I be bolde to shewe you the playnesse, Of my minde, since Mardocheus is heare If it please your grace the truth is doutles, All be it or now I dyd it not confesse, This Mardocheus is for certayne, My fathers brother, no longer I wyll it leyne A gentyll man he is, for lynyallye He is borne of the stocke of Beniaminy, Assuerus. we be ryghte gladde we know his linage, Hys truth to vs before was knowen well, we wyll him aduaunce accordynge hys parage, Holde Mardocheus here is our rynge and seale, It is our truste ye wyll with iustice deale, we commytte therfore vnto youre wyse discrescion, Of all thys prouince iudgemente and corection. Mardocheus. I thanke youre grace trustinge ye shall not heare, In all thynges but as iustice doth requyre, Hester. Noble prince and our espouse moste deare, I beseche youre grace at my supplycation, The precepte youre grace sente at Amans desyre, Againste me and all the Iewishe nation, May be reuoked and vpon conuocation A new deuised by them that can do best, And that sente forthe to set the Iewes at reste. More ouer lett the realme be perused By them that be of your hye councell And if any haue the lawe abused Of all the Iewes with in youre comon weale Let them not spare correction to deale And strayghtly constrayne them selfe to addresse To obserue that law god gaue them by Moses The Iewes be the people of god elected And weare his badge of cyrcumsicion The dayly prayer of that hole secte As the psalmes of Dauid by gostly inspiracion Eke holy ceremonies of gods prouision To god is vaileable, that nothing greater, And al the whole realme for th? fares ye better. Assuerus. Stande ye vp Lady, and approche ye neare your petition we graunte it gladlye, Hester. Than if it please your graee to heare, This epistle is made to the sealyng readye. Assuerus. Let it be red that it maye by and by Be sealed and consigned, and so furthe sent and than I truste ye shall be content. Scriba. Here the Scrybe doeth rede ye k?ges letter. Vve Assuerus kynge, and highe regent from India to Ethiopia plaine Send gretinge and straighte commaundement, To all the heades and rulers sertaine, wyllyng they should vpon a great payne, In a hundreth prouinces, and seuen and twentye All men compell to this our decre All though it be so our preceptes that be sente Be of dyuerse nature, and playne repugnant when ye know our mynd ye shalbe contente To thinke it no lyghtnes, nor wytte in constante But the necessytie of tymes varyant And as cause requereth for the vtyllyte Of our hole reame heedes and comynalte And to the entent ye may know our playne mynde The sonne of Amadathy called Aman A Macedone borne and lyke to theyr owne kynde Not of our nacion, as all men tell can whiche by his sutteltye, both now and than Our gentelnes so in fecteth for certayne That neare we were lyke all Iewes to haue slayne we fauored hym that he was called Our father, and all men dyd to him honoure But his harte wyth pryde, so strongly was walled That by his slyght and crafty demeanoure Had we not espyed his subtile behauoure He wolde haue dystroyd quene Hester our wyfe And from vs at the lengthe haue taken our lyfe But as for the Iewes, we found them innocente And without all blame though to death they were dyth wherfore Aman we thought it conuenient To hang hym tyll the death accordyng to ryght within Susis our noble cetye of myghte Not only our dede nor yet theyr chans nor fate But goddes owne Iustice what so euer they prate, This our precepte and hye cummaundimente, we wolde to all cities ye shoulde declare. This is our purpose and veri entente, The Iewes to theyre lawes them selfe shoulde prepare Duely to kepe them and not from them square, And no man to hurt them see ye remember, As it was mente the .xiii. day of december, Dated at Susis this is certayne, The .iiii. day of december the .iii. yeare of our raine. Assuerus. This is well se it be sealed anon, And that euery citie of them may haue one, Now madam I truste ye be contente. Hester. yea and that veramente, May it now please you your selfe to repose? Assuerus. Very well saue fyrst we wol disclose, Parte of our mynde which we thinke necessary, If it be well hard we truste it shall edifye, My Lordes by this fygure ye may well se, The multitude hurte by the heades necligence, If to his pleasure so geuen is he, That he will no paine take nor dilligence, who careth not for his cure ofte loseth credence, A prouerbe of olde sume time in vsage, Few men that serue but for theyre owne aduauntage. Hester. And yet the seruantes that bee vntrue, A whyle in the world theyr lyfe may they leade, yea theyr welth and worshippe dayly renewe, But at the length I asswre you in dede, Theyr fauell and falsehed wyll come abrede, whiche shall be to them more bytter than gall, The hygher they clyme the deper they fall, Assewerus. Let vs then cesse thys conuocatione, And this tyme dyssolue this congregation. Hester. That lyke as here they haue lyued deuoutly, So god graunt them in heauen to lyue eternally, Assewerus. To the which we committe all this company. FINIS Imprynted at London by Wyllyam Pickerynge and Thomas Hacket, and are to be solde at theyre shoppes.</field>
