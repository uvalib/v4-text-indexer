      <field name="fulltext">ARSINOE, QUEEN of CYPRUS. AN OPERA,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. The Design of this Entertainment being to introduce the Italian manner of Musick on the English Stage, which has not been before attempted; I was oblig'd to have an Italian Opera translated: In which the Words, however mean in several Places, suited much better with that manner of Musick, than others more Poetical would do. The Stile of this Musick is to express the Passions, which is the Soul of Musick: And though the Voices are not equal to the Italian, yet I have engag'd the Best that were to be found in England; and I have not been wanting, to the utmost of my Diligence, in the Instructing of them. The Musick being Recitative, may not, at first, meet with that General Acceptation, as is to be hop'd for from the Audience's being better acquainted with it: But if this Attempt shall, by pleasing the Nobility and Gentry, be a Means of bringing this manner of Musick to be us'd in my Native Country, I shall think all my Study and Pains very well employ'd. Your Humble Servant, Thomas Clayton.</field>

O, in Pity, Ease me of a useless Breath. Pity then, &amp;c. [Goes off. SCENE III. Dorisbe enters, sees Ormondo and is going. Orm. Stop, stop, perfidious, and ungrateful Fair! Dor. Perfidious! Oh Heav'ns, in what have I offended? Orm. Unfaithful, did you not conceal Feraspe in your Closet? Farewel, I'll never see you more. Blind God, from your Chains I am free; My slighted Love, Thy broken Vows, Have set my Heart at Liberty. Blind God, from your Chains I am free, &amp;c. Dor. Ormondo, I am faithful. Orm. What Faith can be in you? Dor. My Heart! my Life! if everâ Orm. Peace, Disloyal. Dor. Ye Gods! Orm. Tempt them no more. Dor. Hear me, at least. Orm. What, can you think I have forgot your Treachery? Dor. O Idol of my Love, I'm innocent! Orm. 'Tis false. At least I'm pleas'd with this Pretence. [Aside. Here, take this Sword, [Gives her Feraspe's Sword. Restore it to Feraspe, with your Love. [Throws it on the Ground. As you desire this will an Action be Of Love to him, Inconstancy to me. SCENE IV. Dorisbe, and Delbo who stays to observe her. Dor. Conqu'ring, O! but cruel Eyes, Why with Rigour will you kill Her, who adores you, And implores you? Can you wish to triumph more? Cease to sparkle with Disdain, More to wound a bleeding Heart. The Conquest sure, Your Slave secure, What Pleasure to encrease the Smart? Can you wish to triumph more? &amp;c. Delbo. Ormondo's gone And leaves Dorisbe weeping; Sure his Heart is made of Marble. Poor Lady, how you are mistaken? [Delbo hearkens. Dor. Go, perjur'd Man! Are these your plighted Vows? Delbo. Thank my Stars, I am an honest Fellow, tho' a poor one. Dor. And am I innocent? Condemn'd and innocent! I'll take this Sword, [Takes up the Sword. And with itâ [Offers to stab her self. Delbo. O Madam, by no means; forbear. Dor. âI'll kill that barb'rous Villain! When Justice sues for Punishment, It goes not unreveng'd. Delbo, what's that you do? [Sees Delbo endeavouring to hide the Scarf in a great Fright. Delbo. Nothing, nothing. Dor. Where's Ormondo? Delbo. I cannot tell. [Still endeavours to hide it. Dor. What is't you hide? A Scarf and Dagger; Ormondo's, are they not? [Takes the Scarf and Dagger from him. Speakâ Delbo. Madam! Dor. 'Tis his; Ormondo's Name, Behold it carv'd upon the Steel. Revenge, revenge! 'Tis now resolv'd Th'usurping Queen shall lose her Crown, And he his Life. Assist ye Furies from the Deep, Revenge, Revenge prepare! Let not Rage and Murder sleep, Revenge be all my Care. Assist, &amp;c. SCENE V. A Palace Hall. Arsinoe and Ormondo. Arsin. Doubtful Heart, O tell me why, Why you love, and not comply? If to Love you will not bend, Whither do thy Wishes tend? Orm. Fearful Heart, I know not why, (Since you love, and constant are) Her pity you forbear to try; Since pity you must find, or die. Arsin. Ormondo, did my Picture please you? Orm. Gods! how her Eyes dart through my Soul? Each Word's a Wound, Each single Look is Death! Arsin. All Love is blind, I know, [Aside. But this is dumb. Ormondo, did my Picture please you? [Ormondo sees Dorisbe enter with the Scarf about her. Orm. Gifts so rare, Above us are; Permit me to retire: I want some little space To bear so great a Grace. [Arsinoe sees Dorisbe with the Scarf. Arsin. No, no, Ormondo, you must stay. Orm. Dorisbe with the Scarf? Then I am lost! [Aside. Arsin. My hopes are past. [Aside. Orm. Was ever Fate; [Aside. Arsin. Was ever State, [Aside. So hard as mine? [Both. Arsin. To be despis'd, [Looking at Ormondo. Orm. To be surpriz'd, [Looking on Dorisbe. By this Design. [Both. Dor. Permit me, Madam, at your Feet to show The Faith and Loyalty I owe. [Kneeling. Arsin. What Loyalty, what Faith? Base Woman, as thou art, This Scarf was never thine. [Tears the Scarf from her, and Dorisbe rises. Dor. Help, Heav'n! Arsin. And you, Ormondo, to despise My Royal Gift; I'll punish both: You are a Traytor, she my Enemy. Orm. I am innocentâ Arsin. Thou art guilty. Dor. My Queen!â Arsin. Thy Fury! Orm. In what have I offended? Arsin. In Treachery. Dor. At leastâ Arsin. At least with Death I'll punish thee. Orm. The Crime!â Arsin. It is too evident. Dor., Orm., Arsin. What Torment?/What Anguish?/What Despair is mine? [All Three. Dor. I understand The Queen's my Rival. [Aside. Arsin. Thou vile, rash Man!â Orm. Not so, my Fair Arsinoe. Arsin. Base, aspiring Woman! Dor. I am Loyal and True. Arsin. Your Love and Lives At once shall endâ The rest decide between your selves. [Exit. Orm. Thus sinking Mariners, In sight of Land are lost; Dash'd on the Rocks, And cannot reach the Coast. [Exit. SCENE VI. Dorisbe alone. Dor. Ye Gods, I stay; but how? The Scoff of Fortune and of Love. I live, But live in wishing Death! I. Ye Stars, that rul'd my Birth, The Man I love restore! Pity my Grief; This one Relief But grant, I ask no more. II. Restore the Jewel of my Heart, All other Losses I can bear: Tho' he flies me, And denies me, He alone is worth my Care, &amp;c. SCENE VII. Enter Nerina and Delbo. Ner. Delbo, if thou wilt not Woe me, Prithee spare a single Kiss; Good Faith, it is a Wrong you do me, To deny so small a Bliss. Delbo. And you, perhaps, believ'd So easie to find Pity; O Lips you are deceiv'd, You are not yet so pretty. Ner. Prithee knit no more thy Brows, Frowns disgrace A charming Face, And but make us Pastime lose: Put on a little dimpling Smile; Pleasing Looks the Heart beguile. Del. The more you entreat, The more 'twill be so: I shall ever repeat, No, no, no, no. SCENE VIII. Arsinoe alone. A Garden. Arsin. To War, my Thoughts! to War! My Passions rage, And Jealousie I call to Fight; To Jealousie I'll give a total Rout. The Trumpet sounds; An Eccho rebounds, Let her die, let her die; let Jealousie die. Dorisbe and Ormondo both conspire To rob my Soul of Rest: I die, I die A Sacrifice, to Love and Jealousie! Arsinoe repose, And ponder thy Misfortune now: [Sits down, and Reposes on her Arm. Must I, who am a Queen, The Laws of Love receive? Share with the trifling Boy my Crown? Oh! what a vast Command I have, At once a Monarch and a Slave? Enter Dorisbe. Dor. Behold, the Tyrant sleeps! [Comes up to Arsinoe with the Dagger in her Hand. Death, seal her Eyes; She sleeps her last: I'll write my Wrongs in Blood; At once pierce hers, and cure my bleeding Heart. SCENE IX. Enter Ormondo on a sudden, who holds Dorisbe. Orm. Hold, hold your Hand! Dor. I am in haste, let go. Orm. What would you do? [They struggle. Dor. Ah let me! Orm. Forbear. Arsin. What do I hear? Dor. She wakes; help, help! [She runs off, leaving the Dagger in Ormondo's Hand. Orm. Vilest of all thy Sex, Wicked Dorisbe! Arsin. Treason, Treason! Who comes to succour me? [She rises up. Orm. My Valour and Fidelity. Arsin. Traitor, thou ly'st. Orm. My Queen, you do me wrong. Arsin. Villain, what Wrong? Did you not hold a Dagger at my Breast? Orm. I swear by all that's good, My Life, my Love!â Arsin. O talk no more of Love, Thou perjur'd Wretch! Reveal the Plot: Who spurr'd you on to this Design? Dorisbe, was it not? Orm. I'll never tell. [Aside. I'll first endureâ Arsin. This Dagger, is it yours? Orm. 'Tis mine. Arsin. Perfidious Destiny! [Aside. Then you design'd to murder me! Orm. No. Arsin. Who then is guilty? Orm.

My Kingdom I would lose [Aside. To find him innocent. [She goes off slowly, looking at him. Fer. Guards! take him hence, Conduct him to the Tower. Orm. I go, Arsinoe, I go, Where you and Destiny command! Grant me but one Look more, To be more wretched than before: [Arsinoe stops and looks back at him, just going off. Alas! too soon that Look is gone, It's gone, and with it draws another on; I must look once again, And so be quite undone. Farewel! since you will have it so. [Arsinoe goes off. I go! And part with Life more easie than with you. SCENE X. Feraspe alone. Fer. Now, Fortune, stand my Friend, And I have won the Prize: Ormondo's on the Brink of Death: This Letter will incense the Queen, And push him headlong to his Fate. Assist, ye Powers above! At last, my shipwrack'd Mind Some Ease will find: Boiling Passions rage no more; Hopes in gentle Gales arising, Calm the troubled Seas of Love, And repelling Storms rebelling, Smiling, waft me to the Shore. Boiling Passions, &amp;c. II. Fav'ring Stars the Passage clearing, Love at last has found the Way: Clouds of Anguish disappearing, Joy attends this happy Day. Fav'ring Stars, &amp;c.

My Heart will harden when I Treason read. [She opens the Letter, throws down the Superscription, and finds a blank Paper. Ye Gods, what nothing here! Ormondo's innocent. O Jealousie, thou raging Ill, Too late, too late, my Love, I see 'Tis I am guilty, thou art free. I'll make what Speed I can, I'll fly, To break thy Bonds, and give thee Liberty. Wanton Zephyrs, Softly blowing, Watching, Catching Whispers going, Bear in Sighs my Soul away. Tell Ormondo what I bear; Tell him how his Chains I wear; Tell him all my Grief and Care: Gently stealing, And revealing More than Love and I can say. Haste away, And convey More than Love and I can say. Wanton Zephyrs, &amp;c. Bear in Sighs my Soul away. [Goes off. SCENE III. A Prison. Ormondo in Chains, with a Letter in his Hand. Orm.

But if my Life with Treason I must buy, Leave me, Dorisbe, I would rather die. Dor. By all that's dear, By all our Loves, Ormondo, I beseech you hear. Orm. Leave, O leave your black Revenge; Against the Queen no more Conspire: When in the Garden you design'd her Death I brought her safely off; And when you held the Dagger at her Breast, Did not I ward the Blow, And wrest it from your Hand? And now, and now, for my Fidelity, To save your Life I sacrifice my own. Arsin. Ye Gods, what more can I desire? My Dear Ormondo's innocent? [Apart to her self. Orm.

To vent the Raptures of my Soul; I scarce know how to bear This mighty swelling Tide of Joy! Your Captive I so long have been, I must petition now to be so still. Arsin. If Freedom you refuse, What is it I can give, Or you can chuse? Pelops. While I do Homage to your Eyes, I still enjoy the Liberty I lose. Arsin. Rise, generous Prince, [He rises and bows. If you by me Have lost your Liberty, I give my self to set you free. Pelops. Thus then I mark you, thus and thus, And thus I seal my own. [Kisses her Hand four times at each Thus. Arsin.
