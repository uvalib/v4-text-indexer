      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. A retired Grove near Antioch.—Enter Cipriano, Eusebio, and Julian, with books. Cipr. This is the place, this the sequester'd spot Where, in the flower about and leaf above, I find the shade and quiet that I love, And oft resort to rest a wearied wing; And here, good lads, leave me alone, but not Lonely, companion'd with the books you bring: That while the city from all open doors Abroad her gaping population pours To swell the triumph of the pomp divine That with procession, sacrifice, and song Convoys her tutelary Zeus along For installation in his splendid shrine; I, flying from the hubbub of the throng That overflows her thoroughfares and streets, And here but faintly touches and retreats, In solitary meditation may Discount at ease my summer holiday. You to the city back, and take your fill Of festival, and all that with the time's, And your own youth's, triumphant temper chimes; Leaving me here alone to mine; until Yon golden idol reaching overhead, Dragg'd from his height, and bleeding out his fires Along the threshold of the west, expires, And drops into the sea's sepulchral lead. Eusebio. Nay, sir, think once again, and go with us, Or, if you will, without us; only, go; Lest Antioch herself as well as we Cry out upon a maim'd solemnity. Julian. Oh, how I wish I had not brought the books, Which you have ever at command—indeed, Without them, all within them carry—here— Garner'd—aloft— Euseb. In truth, if stay you will, I scarcely care to go myself. Cipr. Nay, nay, Good lads, good boys, all thanks, and all the more, If you but leave it simply as I say. You have been somewhat over-taxed of late, And want some holiday. Julian. Well, sir, and you? Cipr. Oh, I am of that tougher age and stuff Whose relaxation is its work. Besides, Think you the poor Professor needs no time For solitary tillage of his brains Before such shrewd ingatherers as you Come on him for their harvest unawares? Away, away! and like good citizens Help swell the general joy with two such faces As such as mine would only help to cloud. Euseb. Nay, sir— Cipr. But I say, Yea, sir! and my scholars By yea and nay as I would have them do. Euseb. Well, then, farewell, sir. Cipr. Farewell, both of you. [Exeunt Eusebio and Julian. Away with them, light heart and wingèd heel, Soon leaving drowsy Pallas and her dull Professor out of sight, and out of mind. And yet not so perhaps; and, were it so, Why, better with the frolic herd forgetting All in the youth and sunshine of the day Than ruminating in the shade apart. Well, each his way and humour; some to lie Like Nature's sickly children in her lap, While all the stronger brethren are at play; When ev'n the mighty Mother's self would seem Drest out in all her festival attire In honour of the universal Sire Whom Antioch as for her own to-day Propitiates. Hark, the music!—Speed, good lads, Or you will be too late. Ah, needless caution! Ev'n now already half way down the hill, Spurr'd by the very blood within their veins, They catch up others, who catching from them The fire they re-inflame, the flying troop Consuming fast to distance in a cloud Of dust themselves have kindled, whirls away Where the shrill music blown above the walls Tells of the solemn work begun within. Why, ev'n the shrieking pipe that pierces here, Shows me enough of all the long procession Of white-robed priest and chanting chorister, The milkwhite victim crown'd, and high aloft The chariot of the nodding deity, Whose brazen eyes that as their sockets see, Stare at his loyal votaries. Ah me!— Well, here too happier, if not wiser, those Who, with the heart of unsuspicious youth, Take up tradition from their fathers' hands To pass it on to others in their turn; But leaving me behind them in the race With less indeed than little appetite For ceremonies, and to gods, like these, That, let the rabble shout for as they please, Another sort begin to shake their heads at, And heav'n to rumble with uneasily As flinging out some antiquated gear. So wide, since subtle Greece the pebble flung Into the sleeping pool of superstition, Its undulation spreads to other shores, And saps at the foundation of our schools. —Why, this last Roman, Caius Plinius— Who drawing nature's growth and history Down to her root and first cause—What says he?— Ev'n at the very threshold of his book A definition laying over which The clumsy mimic idols of our shrines Stumble and break to pieces—oh, here it is— “Quapropter effigiem Dei formamque quærere, Imbecillitatis humanæ reor”— “All visible effigies of God But types of human imbecility.”— But what has Antioch to say to that, Who at such cost of marble and of gold Has built the very temple into which She drags her tutelary Zeus to-day?— Zeus veritable God, this effigy Is none of him at all! But then, alas! This same Quapropter follows a premiss That elbows out Zeus with his effigy. For—as I gather from his foreign word— Wherever, or Whatever, Deity— Si modo est alius—if distinct at all From universal Nature—it must be One all-informing, individual Whole, All eye, all ear, all self, all sense, all soul— Whereas this Zeus of ours, though Chief indeed— Nay, because chief of other gods than he, Comes from this Roman's hand no God at all!— This is a knotty question. Lucifer (without). Nor while I Tangle, for you, good doctor, to untie. Cipr. What! The poor bird scarce settled on the bough, Before the fowler after him! How now? Who's there? Lucifer (entering habited as a Merchant). A stranger; therefore pardon him, Who somehow parted from his company, And lost in his own thoughts (a company You know one cannot lose so easily) Has lost his way to Antioch. Cipr. Antioch! Whose high white towers and temples ev'n from here Challenge the sight, and scarce a random line Traced by a wandering foot along the grass But thither leads for centre. Luc. The old story, Of losing what one should have found on earth By staring after something in the clouds— Is it not so? Cipr. To-day too, when so many Are flocking thither to the festival, Whose current might have told—and taken—you The way you wished to go. Luc. To say the truth, My lagging here behind as much I think From a distaste for that same festival (Of which they told us as we came along) As inadvertency—my way of life Busied enough, if not too much, with men To care for them in crowd on holidays, When business stands, and neither they nor I Gaping about can profit one another; And therefore, by your leave—but only so— I fain would linger in this quiet place Till evening, under whose dusky cloak I may creep unobserv'd to Antioch. Cipr. (aside). Humane address, at least. And why should I Grudge him the quiet I myself desire? (Aloud) Nay, this is public ground—for you, as me, To use it at your pleasure. Luc. Still with yours— Whom by your sober suit and composed looks, And by this still society of books, I take to be a scholar— Cipr. And if so? Luc. Ill brooking idle company. Cipr. Perhaps; But that no wiser traveller need be— And, if I judge of you as you of me, Though with no book hung out for sign before, Perchance a scholar too. Luc. If so, more read In men than books, as travellers are wont. But, if myself but little of a bookman, Addicted much to scholars' company, Of whom I meet with many on my travels, And who, you know, themselves are living books. Cipr. And you have travell'd much? Luc. Aye, little else, One may say, since I came into the world Than going up and down it: visiting As many men and cities as Ulysses, From first his leaving Troy without her crown, Along the charmèd coasts he pass'd, with all The Polyphemes and Circes in the way, Right to the Pillars where his ship went down. Nay, and yet farther, where the dark Phœnician Digs the pale metal which the sun scarce deigns With a slant glance to ripen in earth's veins: Or back again so close beneath his own Proper dominion, that the very mould Beneath he kindles into proper gold, And strikes a living Iris into stone. Cipr. One place, however, where Ulysses was, I think you have not been to—where he saw Those he left dead upon the field of Troy Come one by one to lap the bowl of blood Set for them in the fields of Asphodel. Luc. Humph!—as to that, a voyage which if all Must take, less need to brag of; or perchance Ulysses, or his poet, apt to err About the people and their doings there— But let the wonders in the world below Be what they may; enough in that above For any sober curiosity, Without one's diving down before one's time: Not only countries now as long ago Known, till'd, inhabited, and civilized; As Egypt, Greece, and Rome, with all their arts, Trades, customs, polities, and history: But deep in yet scarce navigated seas, Countries uncouth, with their peculiar growths Of vegetation or of life; where men Are savage as the soil they never till; Or never were, or were so long ago, Their very story blotted from the page Of earth they wrote it on; unless perchance From riot-running nature's overgrowth Of swarming vegetation, peeps some scarce Decypherable monument, which yet, To those who find the key, perchance has told Stories of men, more mighty men, of old, Or of the gods themselves who walk'd the world When with the dews of first creation wet. Cipr. Oh knowledge from the fountain freshly drawn Without the tedious go-between of books! But with fresh soul and senses unimpair'd What from the pale reflection of report We catch at second hand, and much beside That in our solitary cells we miss. Luc. Aye, truly we that travel see strange things, Though said to tell of stranger; some of us, Deceived ourselves, or seeking to deceive, With prodigies and monsters which the world, As wide and full of wonders as it is, Never yet saw, I think, nor ever will: Which yet your scholars use for clay and straw Of which to build your mighty folios— For instance, this same bulky Roman here, Whose leaf you turn'd, I doubt impatiently, When my intrusion rustled in the leaves— Cipr. Hah! But how knew you— Luc. Nay, if some stray words Of old familiar Latin met my ear As I stood hesitating. Cipr. (holding up the book). This at least You read then? Luc. One might say before 'twas written. Cipr. But how so? Luc. Oh, this same sufficient Roman, What is he but another of the many Who having seen a little and heard more That others pick'd as loosely up before, Constructs his little bird's-nest universe Of shreds and particles of false and true Cemented with some thin philosophy, All filch'd from others, as from him to be By the next pilfering philosopher, Till blown away before the rising wind Of true discovery, or dropt to nothing After succeeding seasons of neglect. Cipr. (aside). A strange man this—sharp wit and biting word. (Aloud) Yet surely Man, after so many ages Of patient observation of the world He lives in, is entitled by the wit Vouchsafed him by the Maker of the world To draw into some comprehensive whole The stray particulars. Luc. Aye, and forsooth, Not only the material world he lives in; But, having of this undigested heap Composed a World, must make its Maker too, Of abstract attributes, of each of which Still more unsure than of the palpable, Forthwith he draws to some consistent One The accumulated ignorance of each In so compact a plausibility As light to carry as it was to build. Cipr. But, since (I know not how) you hit upon The question I was trying when you came; And, spite of your disclaiming scholarship, Seem versed in that which occupies the best— If Pliny blunder with his single God, As in our twilight reason well he may, Confess however that a Deity Plural and self-discordant, as he says, Is yet more like frail man's imagination, Who, for his own necessities and lusts, Splits up and mangles the Divine idea To pieces, as he wants a piece of each; Not only gods for all the elements Divided into land, and sea, and sky; But gods of health, wealth, love, and fortune; nay, Of war and murder, rape and robbery; Men of their own worse nature making gods To serve the very vices that suggest them, Which yet upon their fellow-men they visit (Else were an end of human polity) With chain and fine and banishment and death. So that unless man made such gods as these, Then are these gods worse than the man they made. And for the attributes, which though indeed You gibe at us for canvassing, yourself Must grant—as whether one or manifold, Deity in its simplest definition Must be at least eternal— Luc. Well?— Cipr. Yet those Who stuff Olympus are so little that, That Zeus himself, the sovereign of all, Barely escaped devouring at his birth By his own father, who anticipated And found some such hard measure for himself; And as for Zeus' own progeny—some born Of so much baser matter than his brain, As from his eggs, which the all-mighty swan Impregnated, and mortal Leda lay; And whose two chicken-deities once hatcht Now live and die on each alternate day. Luc. Aye, but if much of this be allegory In which the wisdom of antiquity Veils the pure Deity from eyes profane— Cipr. —Deity taking arms against itself Under Troy walls, wounding and wounded—aye, And, trailing heavenly ichor from their wounds, So help'd by others from the field to one Who knew the leech's art themselves did not. Luc. Softly—if not to swear to allegory, Still less to all the poets sing of heaven, High up Parnassus as they think to sit. Cipr. But these same poets, therefore sacred call'd, They are who these same allegories spin Which time and fond tradition consecrates; What might have been of the divine within So overgrown with folly and with sin As but a spark of God would such impure Assimilation with himself abjure, Which yet with all the nostril that he may Zeus snuffs from Antioch's sacrifice to-day. Besides, beyond the reach of allegory The gods themselves in their own oracles Doubly themselves convict— As when they urge two nations on to war, By promising the victory to each; Whereby on one side their omniscience Suffers, as their all-goodness on the other. Luc. What if such seeming contradictions aim Where human understanding cannot reach? But granting for the sake of argument, And for that only, what you now premise; What follows? Cipr. Why, that if, as Pliny writes, Deity by its very definition Be one, eternal, absolute, all wise, All good, omnipotent, all ear, all eyes, Incapable of disintegration— If this be Deity indeed— Luc. Then what? Cipr. Simply—that we in Antioch know him not. Luc. Rash leap to necessary non-conclusion From a premiss that quarrels with itself More than the deity it would impugn; For if one God eternal and all wise, Omnipotent to do as to devise, Whence this disorder and discordance in— Not only this material universe, That seems created only to be rack'd By the rebellion of its elements, In earthquake and tempestuous anarchy— But also in the human microcosm You say created to reflect it all? For Deity, all goodness as all wise, Why create man the thing of lust and lies You say reflects himself in his false god?— By modern oracle no more convicted Of falsehood, than by that first oracle Which first creation settled in man's heart. No, if you must define, premise, conclude, Away with all the coward squeamishness That dares not face the universe it questions; Blinking the evil and antagonism Into its very constitution breathed By him who, but himself to quarrel with, Quarrels as might the many with each other. Or would you be yourself one with yourself, Catch hold of such as Epicurus' skirt, Who, desperately confounded this confusion Of matter, spirit, good and evil, yea, Godhead itself, into a universe That is created, roll'd along, and ruled, By no more wise direction than blind Chance. Trouble yourself no more with disquisition That by sad, slow, and unprogressive steps Of wasted soul and body lead to nothing: And only sure of life's short breathing-while, And knowing that the gods who threaten us With after-vengeance of the very crimes They revel in themselves, are nothing more Than the mere coinage of our proper brain To cheat us of our scanty pleasure here With terror of a harsh account hereafter;— Eat, drink, be merry; crown yourselves with flowers About as lasting as the heads they garland; And snatching what you can of life's poor feast, When summon'd to depart, with no ill grace, Like a too greedy guest, cling to the table Whither the generations that succeed Press forward famish'd for their turn to feed. Nay, or before your time self-surfeited, Wait not for nature's signal to be gone, But with the potion of the spotted weed, That peradventure wild beside your door For some such friendly purpose cheaply grows, Anticipate too tardy nature's call: Ev'n as one last great Roman of them all Dismiss'd himself betimes into the sum Of universe; not nothing to become; For that can never cease that was before; But not that sad Lucretius any more. Cipr. Oh, were it not that sometimes through the dark, That walls us all about, a random ray Breaks in to tell one of a better day Beyond— Enter Lelio and Floro, as about to fight. Lelio. Enough—these branches that exclude the sun Defy all other inquisition. No need of further way. Floro. Nor further word; Draw, sir, at once— Lelio. Nay, parry that yourself Which waited not your summons to be drawn. Cipr. Lelio, and Floro? Floro. What, will the leaves blab? Lelio. And with their arms arrest a just revenge? Cipr. And well indeed may trees begin to talk, When men as you go babbling. Floro. Whoso speaks And loves his life, hold back. Lelio. I know the voice, But dazzled with the darkness—Cipriano! Cipr. Aye; Cipriano, sure enough; as you Lelio and Floro. Floro. Well, let that suffice, And leave us as you find us. Cipr. No, not yet— Floro. Not yet! Lelio. Good Cipriano— Cipr. Till I know How it has come to pass that two such friends, Each of the noblest blood in Antioch, Are here to shed it by each other's hands. Lelio. Sudden surprise, and old respect for you, Suspend my sword a moment, Cipriano, That else— Floro. Stand back, stand back! You are a scholar, And better versed in logic than the laws Of honour; and perhaps have yet to learn That when two noblemen have drawn the sword, One only must return it to the sheath. Lelio. 'Tis so indeed—once more, stand off. Cipr. And once more Back, both of you, say I; if of your lives Regardless, not of mine, which thus, unarm'd, I fling between your swords— Lelio, I look to you—Floro, as ever Somewhat hot-headed and thrasonical— Or do you hold with him the scholar's gown Has smother'd all the native soldiery That saucy so-call'd honour to itself Alone mis-arrogates! You are deceived: I am like you by birth a gentleman, Under like obligation to the laws Of that true honour, which my books indeed May help distinguish from its counterfeit, But, older as I am, have yet not chill'd From catching fire at any just affront— And let me tell you this too—those same books, Ancient and modern, tell of many a hand That, turning most assiduously the leaf, When the time came, could wield as well the sword. I am unarm'd: but you, with all your swords, I say you shall not turn them on each other Till you have told me what the quarrel is; Which after hearing if I own for one That honour may not settle with good word, I pledge my own to leave it to the sword. Now, Lelio?— Lelio. One answer does for both: He loves where I love. Floro. No—I thus much more— He dares to love where I had loved before; Betrayèd friendship adding to the score Of upstart love. Lelio. You hear him, Cipriano? And after such a challenge— Cipr. Yet a moment. As there are kinds of honour, so of love— And ladies— Lelio. Cipriano, Cipriano! One friend my foe for daring love where I, Let not another, daring doubt that he Honours himself in so dishonouring me— Floro. Slanting your sharp divisions on a jewel That if the sun turn'd all his beams upon He could not find, or make, a flaw— Cipr. Nor I then, With far less searching scrutiny than Phœbus— I am to understand then, such a fair Jewel as either would in wedlock wear. Floro. And rather die than let another dare. Cipr. Enough, enough! of Lelio's strange logic, And Floro's more intelligible rant, And back to sober metaphor. Which of you Has this fair jewel turn'd her light upon? Floro (after a pause). Why, who would boast— Lelio. Indeed, how could she be The very pearl of chastity she is, Turn'd she her glances either left or right? Cipr. Which therefore each, as he obliquely steals, Counts on as given him only— Floro. To have done With metaphor and logic, what you will, So as we fall to work; Or if you must have reason, this, I say, Resolves itself to a short syllogism— Whether she give or we presume upon— If one of us devote himself to win her, How dares another cross him? Cipr. But if she Not only turn to neither, but still worse, Or better, turn from both? Lelio. But love by long devotion may be won, That only one should offer— Floro. And that one Who first— Lelio. Who first!— Cipr. And all this while, forsooth, The lady, of whose purity one test Is her unblemisht unpublicity, Is made a target for the common tongue Of Antioch to shoot reproaches at For stirring up two noblemen to blood. From which she only can escape, forsooth, By choosing one of two she cares not for At once; or else, to mend the matter, when He comes to claim her by the other's blood. Lelio. At least she will not hate him, live or dead, Who staked his life upon her love. Cipr. Small good To him who lost the stake; and he that won— Will she begin to love whom not before For laying unloved blood upon her door; Or, if she ever loved at all, love more? Is this fair logic, or of one who knows No more of woman's honour than of man's? Come, come, no more of beating round the bush. You know how I have known and loved you both, As brothers—say as sons—upon the score Of some few years and some few books read more— Though two such fiery fine young gentlemen, Put up your swords and be good boys again, Deferring to your ancient pedagogue; If cold by time and studies, as you say, Then fitter for a go-between in love, And warm at least in loyalty to you. These jewels—to take up the metaphor Until you choose to drop it of yourselves,— These jewels have their caskets, I suppose— Kindred and circumstance, I mean— Lelio. Oh such As by their honourable poverty Do more than doubly set their jewel off! Cipr. Ev'n so? And may not one, who, you agree, Proof-cold against suspicion of the kind, Be so far trusted, as, if not to see, To hear, at least, of where, and how, enshrined? Floro. I know not what to answer. How say you? Lelio. Relying on your honour and tried love— Justina, daughter of the old Lisandro. Cipr. I know them; her if scarcely, yet how far Your praises short of her perfections are; Him better, by some little service done That rid him of a greater difficulty, And would again unlock his door to me— —And who knows also, if you both agree, Her now closed lips; if but a sigh between May tell which way the maiden heart may lean? Floro. Again, what say you, Lelio? Lelio. I, for one, Content with that decision. Floro. Be it so. Cipr. Why, after all, behold how luckily You stumbled on this rock in honour's road, That serves instead for Cupid's stepping-stone. And when the knightly courage of you both Was all at fault to hammer out the way, Who knows but some duenna-doctor may? And will—if but like reasonable men, Not angry boys, you promise to keep sheath'd Your swords, while from her father or herself I gather, from a single sigh perhaps, To which, if either, unaware she turns; Provided, if to one, the other yield; But if to neither, both shall quit the field. What say you both to this? Lelio. Aye—I for one. Floro. And I; provided on the instant done. Cipr. No better time than now, when, as I think, The city, with her solemn uproar busy, Shuts her we have to do with close within. But you must come along with me, for fear Your hands go feeling for your swords again If left together: and besides to know The verdict soon as spoken. Lelio. Let us go. [Exeunt. Lucifer (re-appearing). Aye, Cipriano, faster than you think; For I will lend you wings to burn yourself In the same taper they are singed withal.— By the quick feelers of iniquity That from hell's mouth reach through this lower world, And tremble to the lightest touch of mischief, Warn'd of an active spirit hereabout Of the true God inquisitive, and restless Under the false by which I rule the world, Here am I come to test it for myself. And lo! two fools have put into my hand The snare that, wanting most, I might have miss'd; That shall not him alone en-mesh, but her Whom I have long and vainly from the ranks Striv'n to seduce of Him, the woman-born, Who is one day to bruise the serpent's head— So is it written; but meanwhile my hour On earth is not accomplisht, and I fain Of this detested race would hinder all From joining in the triumph of my fall Whom I may hinder; and of these, these twain; Each other by each other snaring; yea, Either at once the other's snare and prey. Oh, my good doctor, you must doubt, you must, And take no more the good old gods on trust; To Antioch then away; but not so fast But I shall be before you, starting last. Scene II. A Room in Lisandro's house.—Enter Lisandro, Justina, and Livia. Justina. At length the day draws in. Lisandro. And in with it The impious acclamation that all day, Block up our doors and windows as we may, Insults our faith, and doubly threatens it. Is all made fast, Justina? Just. All shall be, sir, When I have seen you safely to your rest. Lis. You know how edict after edict aim'd By Rome against the little band of Christ— And at a time like this, the people drunk With idol-ecstasy— Just. Alas, alas! Lis. Oh, gladly would I scatter these last drops That now so scarcely creep along my veins, And these thin locks that tremble o'er the grave, In such a martyrdom as swept to heav'n The holy Paul who planted, and all those Who water'd here the true and only faith, Wer't not for thee, for fear of thee, Justina, Drawing you down at once into my doom, Or leaving you behind, alone, to hide From insult and suspicion worse than death— I dare not think of it. Make fast; keep close; And then, God's will be done! You know we lie Under a double danger. Just. How so, sir? Lis. Aurelio and Fabio, both, you know, So potent in the city, and but now Arm'd with a freshly whetted sword of vengeance Against the faith, but double-edged on us, Should they but know, as know they must, their sons Haunting the doors of this suspected house. Just. Alas, alas! That I should draw this danger on your head! Which yet you know— Lis. I know, I know—God knows, My darling daughter; but that chaste reserve Serves but to quicken beauty with a charm They find not in the wanton Venus here: Drawn as they are by those withdrawing eyes Irradiate from a mother's, into whose The very eyes of the Redeemer look'd, And whom I dare not haste to join in heav'n At cost of leaving thee defenceless here. Just. Sufficient for the day! And now the day Is done. Come to your chamber—lean on me— Livia and I will see that all is fast; And, that all seen to, ere we sleep ourselves, Come to your bedside for your blessing. Hark! Knocking ev'n now! See to it, Livia. (She leads out Lisandro, and returns.) Oh, well I got my father to his chamber! What is it?— Livia. One would see your father, madam. Just. At such an hour! He cannot, Livia; You know, the poor old man is gone to rest— Tell him— Livia. If not your father, then yourself, On matter that he says concerns you both. Just. Me too!—Oh surely neither of the twain We both so dread? Livia. No, madam; rather, one I think that neither need have cause to fear,— Cipriano. Just. Cipriano! The great scholar, Who did my father service, as I think, And now may mean another; and God knows How much, or quickly, needed! Livia. So he says. Just. What shall I do! Will not to-morrow— Cipriano (entering). Oh, lady, You scarce can wonder more than I myself At such a visit, and at such an hour, Only let what I come to say excuse The coming, and so much unmannerly. Just. My father is withdrawn, sir, for the night, Never more wanting rest; I dare not rouse him, And least of all with any troubled news. Will not to-morrow— Cipr. What I have to say Best told to-night, at once; and not the less Since you alone, whom chiefly it concerns, Are here to listen. Just. I!—Well, sir, relying On your grave reputation as a scholar, And on your foregone favour to my father, If I should dare to listen— Cipr. And alone? Just. Livia, leave us. [Exit Livia. Cipr. Oh, lady—oh, Justina— (Thus stammers the ambassador of love In presence of its sovereign)— You must—cannot but—know how many eyes Those eyes have wounded— Just. Nay, sir,— Cipr. Nay, but hear. I do not come for idle compliment, Nor on my own behalf; but in a cause On which hang life and death as well as love. Two of the noblest youths in Antioch, Lelio and Floro—Nay, but hear me out: Mine, and till now almost from birth each other's Inseparable friends, now deadly foes For love of you— Just. Oh, sir! Cipr. I have but now Parted their swords in mortal quarrel cross'd. Just. Oh, that was well. Cipr. I think, for several sakes— Their own, their fathers', even Antioch's, That would not lose one of so choice a pair; And I am sure you think so, lady—yours, So less than covetous of public talk, And least of all at such a fearful cost. Just. Oh, for all sakes all thanks! Cipr. Yet little due For what so lightly done, and it may be So insufficiently; this feud not stopt— Suspended only, on a single word— Which now at this unseasonable hour I stand awaiting from the only lips That can allay the quarrel they have raised. Just. Alas, why force an answer from my lips So long implied in silent disregard? Cipr. Yet, without which, like two fierce dogs, but more Exasperated by the holding back, They will look for it in each other's blood. Just. And think, poor men, to find their answer there! Oh, sir, you are the friend, the friend of both, A famous scholar; with authority And eloquence to press your friendship home. Surely in words such as you have at will You can persuade them, for all sakes—and yet No matter mine perhaps—but, as you say, Their fathers', Antioch's, their own— Cipr. Alas! I doubt you know not in your maiden calm How fast all love and logic such as that Burns stubble up before a flame like this! Just. (aside). And none in heav'n to help them! Cipr. All I can But one condition hardly wringing out Of peace, till my impartial embassy Have ask'd on their behalf, which of the twain— How shall I least offend?—you least disdain? Just. Disdain is not the word, sir; oh, no, no! I know and honour both as noblemen Of blood and station far above my own; And of so suitable accomplishments. Oh, there are many twice as fair as I, And of their own conditions, who, with half My wooing, long ere this had worn the wreath Tied with a father's blessing, and all Antioch To follow them with Hymenæal home. Cipr. But if these fiery men, do what one will, Will look no way but this?— Just. Oh, but they will; Divert their eyes awhile, a little while, Their hearts will follow; such a sudden passion Can but have struck a shallow root—perhaps Ere this had perisht, had not rival pride Between them blown it to this foolish height. Cipr. Disdain is not the word then. Well, to seek, What still as wide as ever from assent— Could you but find it in your heart to feel If but a hair's-breadth less—say disesteem For one than for another— Just. No, no, no! Even to save their lives I could not say What is not—cannot—nay, and if it could And I could say that was that is not—can not— How should that hair's-breadth less of hope to one Weigh with the other to desist his suit, Both furious as you tell me? Cipr. And both are: But ev'n that single hair thrown in by you Will turn the scale that else the sword must do. Just. But surely must it not suffice for both That they who drew the sword in groundless hope Sheathe it in sure despair? Despair! Good God! For a poor creature like myself, despair! That men with souls to which a word like that Lengthens to infinite significance, Should pin it on a wretched woman's sleeve! But as men talk—I mean, so far as I Can make them, as they say, despair of that Of which, even for this world's happiness, Despair is better hope of better things— Will not my saying—and as solemnly As what one best may vouch for; that so far As any hope of my poor liking goes, Despair indeed they must—why should not this Allay their wrath, and let relapsing love In his old channel all the clearer run For this slight interjection in the current? Why should it not be so? Cipr. Alas, I know not: For though as much they promised, yet I doubt When each, however you reject him now, Believes you might be won hereafter still, Were not another to divide the field; Each upon each charging the exigence He will not see lies in himself alone, Might draw the scarcely sheathèd sword at once; Or stifled hate under a hollow truce Blaze out anew at some straw's provocation, And I perhaps not by to put it out. Just. What can, what can be done then! Cipr. Oh Justina, Pardon this iteration. Think once more, Before your answer with its consequence Travels upon my lip to destiny. I know you more than maiden-wise reserved To other importunities of love Than those which ev'n the pure for pure confess; Yet no cold statue, which, however fair, Could not inflame so fierce a passion; but A breathing woman with a beating heart, Already touch'd with pity, you confess, For these devoted men you cannot love. Well, then—I will not hint at such a bower As honourable wedlock would entwine About your father's age and your own youth, Which ev'n for him—and much less for yourself— You would not purchase with an empty hand. But yet, with no more of your heart within Than what you now confess to—pity—pity, For generous youth wearing itself away In thankless adoration at your door, Neglecting noble opportunities; Turning all love but yours to deadly hate— Sedate, and wise, and modestly resolved, Can you be, lady, of yourself so sure— (And surely they will argue your disdain As apt to yield as their devotion)— That, all beside so honourably faced, You, who now look with pity, and perhaps With gratitude, upon their blundering zeal, May not be won to turn an eye less loath On one of them, and blessing one, save both? Just. Alas! I know it is impossible— Not if they wasted all their youth in sighs, And even slavish importunities, I could but pity—pity all the more That all the less what only they implore To yield; so great a gulf between us lies. Cipr. What—is the throne pre-occupied? Just. If so, By one that Antioch dreams little of. But it grows late: and if we spoke till dawn, I have no more to say. Cipr. Nor more will hear? Just. Alas, sir, to what purpose? When, all said, Said too as you have said it— And I have but the same hard answer still; Unless to thank you once and once again, And charge you with my thankless errand back, But in such better terms, As, if it cannot stop ill blood, at least Shall stop blood-shedding 'tween these hapless men. Cipr. And shall the poor ambassador who fail'd In the behalf of those who sent him here, Hereafter dare to tell you how he sped In making peace between them? Just. Oh, do but that, And what poor human prayer can win from Heav'n, You shall not be the poorer. So, good-night! Cipr. Good-night, good-night! Oh Lelio and Floro! If ever friends well turn'd to deadly foes, Wiser to fight than I to interpose. Lucifer (passing from behind). The shaft has hit the mark; and by the care Of hellish surgery shall fester there.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. —The sea-shore; a storm raging. Cipriano (cavalierly drest). Oh, mad, mad, mad, ambition! to the skies Lifting to drop me deep as Hades down!— What! Cipriano—what the once so wise Cipriano—quit his wonted exercise Among the sober walks of old renown, To fly at love—to swell the wind with sighs Vainer than learning—doff the scholar's gown For cap and feather, and such airy guise In which triumphant love is wont to go, But wins less acceptation in her eyes— The only eyes in which I cared to show— My heart beneath the borrow'd feather bleeding— Than in the sable suit of long ago, When heart-whole for another's passion pleading. She loves not Floro—loves not Lelio, Whose quarrel sets the city's throat agape, And turns her reputation to reproof With altercation of some dusky shape Haunting the twilight underneath her roof— Which each believes the other:—and, for me, The guilty one of the distracted three, She closest veils herself, or waves aloof In scorn; or in such self-abasement sweet As sinks me deep and deeper at her feet, Bids me return—return for very shame Back to my proper studies and good name, Nor waste a life on one who, let me pine To death, will never but in death be mine. Oh, she says well—Oh, heart of stone and ice Unworthy of the single sacrifice Of one true heart's devotion! Oh divine Creature, whom all the glory and the worth That ever ravaged or redeem'd the earth Were scanty worship offered at your shrine! Oh Cipriano, master-fool of all The fools that unto thee for wisdom call; Of supercilious Pallas first the mock, And now blind Cupid's scorn, and laughing-stock; Who in fantastic arrogance at odds With the Pantheon of your people's gods Ransack'd the heavens for one more pure and whole To fill the empty temple of the soul, Now caught by retribution in the mesh Of one poor piece of perishable flesh— What baser demon of the pit would buy With all your ruin'd aspirations! Lucifer (within). I!— Cipr. What! The very winds and waters Hear, and answer to the cry She is deaf to!—Better thrown On distracted nature's bosom With some passion like my own Torn and tortured: where the sun In the elemental riot Ere his daily reign half done, Leaves half-quencht the tempest-drencht Welkin scowling on the howling Wilderness of waves that under Slash of whirlwind, spur of lightning, Roar of thunder, black'ning, whit'ning, Fling them foaming on the shore— Let confusion reign and roar!— Lightnings, for your target take me! Waves, upon the sharp rock break me, Or into your monstrous hollow Back regurgitating hurl; Let the mad tornado whirl me To the furthest airy circle Dissipated of the sky, Or the gaping earth down-swallow To the centre!— Lucifer (entering). By-and-bye. Cipr. Hark again! and in her monstrous Labour, with a human cry Nature yearning—what portentous Glomeration of the storm Darkly cast in human form, Has she bolted!— Luc. As among Flashes of the lightning flung Beside you, in its thunder now Aptly listen'd— Cipr. What art thou? Luc. One of a realm, though dimly in your charts Discern'd, so vast that as from out of it As from a fountain all the nations flow, Back they shall ebb again; and sway'd by One Who, without Oriental over-boast, Because from him all kings their crowns derive, Is rightfully saluted King of kings, Whose reign is as his kingdom infinite, Whose throne is heaven, and earth his footstool, and Sun, moon, and stars his diadem and crown. Who at the first disposal of his kingdom And distribution into sea and land— Me, who for splendour of my birth and grand Capacities above my fellows shone, Star of the Morning, Lucifer, alone— Me he made captain of the host who stand Clad as the morning star about his throne. Enough for all ambition but my own; Who discontented with the all but all Of chiefest subject of Omnipotence Rebell'd against my Maker; insolence Avenged as soon as done on me and all Who bolster'd up rebellion, by a fall Far as from heav'n to Hades. Madness, I know; But worse than madness whining to repent Under a rod that never will relent. Therefore about the land and sea I go Arm'd with the very instrument of hate That blasted me: lightnings anticipate My coming, and the thunder rolls behind; Thus charter'd to enlarge among mankind, And to recruit from human discontent My ranks in spirit, not in number, spent. Of whom, in spite of this brave gaberdine, I recognize thee one: thee, by the line Scarr'd on thy brow, though not so deep as mine; Thee by the hollow circles of those eyes Where the volcano smoulders but not dies: Whose fiery torrent running down has scarr'd The cheek that time had not so deeply marr'd. Do not I read thee rightly? Cipr. But too well. However come to read me— Luc. By the light Of my own darkness reading yours—how deep! But not, as mine is, irretrievable: Who from the fulness of my own perdition Would, as I may, revenge myself on him By turning to fruition your despair— What if I make you master at a blow, Not only of the easy woman's heart You now despair of as impregnable, And waiting but my word to let you in, But lord of nature's secret, and the lore That shall not only with the knowledge, but Possess you with the very power of him You sought so far and vainly for before: So far All-eyes, All-wise, Omnipotent— If not to fashion, able yet to shake That which the other took such pains to make— As in the hubbub round us; I who blurr'd The spotless page of nature at a word With darkness and confusion, will anon Clear it, to write another marvel on.— By the word of power that binds And loosens; by the word that finds Nature's heart through all her rinds, Hearken, waters, fires, and winds; Having had your roar, once more Down with you, or get you gone. Cipr. With the clatter and confusion Of the universe about me Reeling—all within, without me,— Dizzy, dazzled—if delusion, Waking, dreaming, seeing, seeming— Which I know not—only, lo! Like some mighty madden'd beast Bellowing in full career Of fury, by a sudden blow Stunn'd, and in a moment stopt All the roar, or into slow Death-ward-drawing murmur, leaving Scarce the fallen carcase heaving, With the fallen carcase dropt.— Behold! the word scarce fallen from his lips, Swift almost as a human smile may chase A frown from some conciliated face, The world to concord from confusion slips: The winds that blew the battle up dead slain, Or with their tatter'd standards swept amain From heav'n; the billows of the erected deep Roll'd with their crests into the foaming plain; While the scared earth begins abroad to peep And smooth her ruffled locks, as from a rent In the black centre of the firmament, Revenging his unnatural eclipse, The Lord of heav'n from its ulterior blue That widens round him as he pierces through The folded darkness, from his sovereign height Slays with a smile the dragon-gloom of night. Luc. All you have heard and witness'd hitherto But a foretaste to quicken appetite For that substantial after-feast of power That I shall set you down to take your fill of: When not the fleeting elements alone Of wind, and fire, and water, floating wrack, But this same solid frame of earth and stone, Yea, with the mountain loaded on her back, Reluctantly, shall answer to your spell From a more adamantine heart stone-cold Than hers you curse for inaccessible. What, you would prove it? Let the mountain there Step out for witness. Listen, and behold. Monster upshot of upheaving Earth, by fire and flood conceiving; Shapeless ark of refuge, whither, When came deluge creeping round, Man retreated—to be drown'd— Now your granite anchor, fast In creation's centre, cast, Come with all your tackle cleaving Down before the magic blast— Cipr. And the unwieldy vessel, lo! Rib and deck of rock, and shroud Of pine, top-gallanted with cloud, All her forest-canvas squaring, Down the undulating woodland As she flounders to and fro All before her tearing, bearing Down upon us— Luc. Anchor, ho!— Behold the ship in port! And what if freighted With but one jewel, worthy welcome more Than ever full-fraught Argosy awaited At last descried by desperate eyes ashore; From the first moment of her topsail showing Like a thin cobweb spun 'twixt sea and sky; Then momently before a full wind blowing Into her full proportions, till athwart The seas that bound beneath her, by and bye She sweeps full sail into the cheering port— Strangest bark that ever plied In despite of wind and tide, At the captain's magic summons Down your granite ribs divide, And show the jewel hid inside. Cipr. Justina!— Luc. Soft! The leap that looks so easy Yet needs a longer stride than you can master. Cipr. Oh divine apparition, that I fain Would all my life as in Elysium lose Only by gazing after; and thus soon As rolling cloud across the long'd-for moon, The impitiable rocks enclose again!— But was it she indeed? Luc. She that shall be, And yours, by means that, bringing her to you, Possess you of all nature, which in vain You sigh'd for ere for nature's masterpiece. And thus much, as I told you, only sent As foretaste of that great accomplishment, Which if you will but try for, you can reach By means which, if I practise, I can teach. Cipr. And at what cost? Luc. You that have flung so many years away In learning and in love that came to nothing, Think not to win the harvest in a day! The God you search for works, you know, by means (That your philosophers call second cause), And we by means must underwork him— Cipr. Well?— Luc. To comprehend, and, after, to constrain Whose mysteries you will not count as vain A year in this same mountain lock'd with me?— Cipr. Where she is?— Luc. As I told you, where shall be. At least this mountain after a short labour Has brought forth something better than a mouse; And what then after a whole year's gestation Accomplish under our joint midwifery, Under a bond by which you bind you mine In fewer and no redder drops than needs The leech of land or water when he bleeds? Let us about—but first upon his base The mountain we must study in replace, That else might puzzle your geography. Come, take your stand upon the deck with me, Till with her precious cargo safe inside, And all her forest-colours flying wide, The mighty vessel put again to sea— What, are you ready?—Wondrous smack, As without a turn or tack Hither come, so thither back, And let subside the ruffled deep Of earth to her primæval sleep.— How steadily her course the good ship trims, While Antioch far into the distance swims, With all her follies bubbling in the wake; Her scholars that more hum than honey make: Muses so chaste as never of their kind Would breed, and Cupid deaf as well as blind: For Cipriano, wearied with the toil Of so long working on a thankless soil, At last embarking upon magic seas In a more wondrous Argo than of old, Sets sails with me for such Hesperides As glow with more than dragon-guarded gold.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. Before the mountain. Cipriano. Cipriano. Now that at last in his eternal round Hyperion, after skirting either pole, Of his own race has set the flaming goal In heav'n of my probation under-ground: Up from the mighty Titan with his feet Touching the centre, and his forest-hair Entangling with the stars; whose middle womb Of two self-buried lives has been the tomb; At last, my year's apprenticeship complete, I rise to try my cunning, and as one Arm'd in the dark who challenges the sun. You heav'ns, for me your azure brows with cloud Contract, or to your inmost depth unshroud: Thou sapphire-floating counterpart below, Obedient to my moon-like magic flow: For me you mountains fall, you valleys rise, With all your brooks and fountains far withdrawn; You forests shudder underneath my sighs; And whatsoever breathes in earth and skies; You birds that on the bough salute the dawn; And you wild creatures that through wood and glen Do fly the hunter, or the hunter flies; Yea, man himself, most terrible to men; Troop to my word, about my footstep fawn; Yea, ev'n you spirits that by viewless springs Move and perplex the tangled web of things, Wherever in the darkest crypt you lurk Of nature, nature to my purpose work; That not the dead material element, But complicated with the life beyond Up to pure spirit, shall my charm resent, And take the motion of my magic wand; And, once more shaken on her ancient throne, In me old nature a new master own. Lucifer. But how is this, Cipriano, that misled By hasty passion you affront the day Ere master of the art of darkness? Cipr. Nay, By that same blazing witness overhead Standing in heav'n to mark the time foretold, Since first imprison'd in this mountain-hold My magic so preluded with the dread Preliminary kingdom of the dead, That not alone the womb of general earth Which Death has crowded thick with second birth, But monuments with marble lips composed To dream till doomsday, suddenly disclosed, And woke their sleepers centuries too soon To stare upon the old remember'd moon. Wearied of darkness, I will see the day: Sick of the dead, the living will assay: And if the ghastly year I have gone through Bear half its promised harvest, will requite With a too warm good-morrow the long night That one cold living heart consign'd me to. Luc. Justina! Cipr. Aye, Justina: now no more Obsequiously sighing at the door That never open'd, nor the heart of stone On which so long I vainly broke my own; But of her soul and body, when and how I will, I claim the forfeit here and now. Luc. Enough: the hour is come; do thou design The earth with circle, pentagram, and trine; The wandering airs with incantation twine; While through her sleep-enchanted sense I shake The virgin constancy I cannot break. (Clouds roll before the mountain, hiding Cipriano.) Thou nether realm of darkness and despair, Whose fire-enthronèd emperor am I; Where many-knotted till the word they lie, Your subtlest spirits at the word untie, And breathe them softly to this upper air; With subtle soft insinuation fair Of foul result encompass and attaint The chastity of the rebellious saint Who dares the Spirit of this world defy. Spirits that do shapeless float In darkness as in light the mote, At my summons straightway take Likeness of the fairest make, And, her sleeping sense about Seal'd from all the world without, Through the bolted eyelids creep; Entheatre the walls of sleep With an Eden where the sheen Of the leaf and flower between All is freshest, yet with Eve's Apple peeping through the leaves; Through whose magic mazes may Melancholy fancy stray Till she lose herself, or into Softer passion melt away: While the scent-seducing rose Gazing at her as she goes With her turning as she turns, Into her his passion burns; While the wind among the boughs Whispers half-remember'd vows; Nightingale interpreters Into their passion translate hers; And the murmurs of a stream Down one current draw the dream. While for hidden chorus, I At her dreaming supply Such a comment as her own Heart to nature's shall atone: Till the secret influence Of the genial season even Holy blood that sets to heaven Draws into the lower sense; Till array'd in angel guise Earthly memories surprise Ev'n the virgin soul, and win Holy pity's self to sin. (The clouds roll away, and discover Justina asleep in her chamber.) Lucifer (at her ear). Come forth, come forth, Justina, come; for scared Winter is vanisht, and victorious Spring Has hung her garland on the boughs he bared: Come forth; there is a time for everything. Justina (in her sleep). That was my father's voice—come, Livia— My mantle—oh, not want it?—well then, come. Luc. Aye, come abroad, Justina; it is Spring; The world is not with sunshine and with leaf Renew'd to be the tomb of ceaseless grief; Come forth: there is a time for everything. Just. How strange it is— I think the garden never look'd so gay As since my father died. Luc. Ev'n so: for now, Returning with the summer wind, the hours Dipt in the sun re-dress the grave with flowers, And make new wreaths for the survivor's brow; Whose spirit not to share were to refuse The power that all creating, all renews With self-diffusive warmth, that, with the sun's, At this due season through creation runs, Nor in the first creation more exprest Than by the singing builder of the nest That waves on this year's leaf, or by the rose That underneath them in his glory glows; Life's fountain, flower, and crown; without whose giving Life itself were not, nor, without, worth living. Chorus of Voices. Life's fountain, flower, and crown; without whose giving Life itself were not, nor, without, worth living. Song. Who that in his hour of glory Walks the kingdom of the rose, And misapprehends the story Which through all the garden blows; Which the southern air who brings It touches, and the leafy strings Lightly to the touch respond; And nightingale to nightingale Answering a bough beyond— Chorus. Nightingale to nightingale Answering a bough beyond. Just. These serenaders—singing their old songs Under one's window— Luc. Aye, and if nature must decay or cease Without it; what of nature's masterpiece? Not in her outward lustre only, but Ev'n in the soul within the jewel shut; What but a fruitless blossom; or a lute Without the hand to touch it music-mute: Incense that will not rise to heav'n unfired; By that same vernal spirit uninspired That sends the blood up from the heart, and speaks In the rekindled lustre of the cheeks? Chorus. Life's fountain, flower, and crown; without whose giving Life itself were not, nor, without, worth living. Song. Lo the golden Girasolé, That to him by whom she burns, Over heaven slowly, slowly, As he travels ever turns; And beneath the wat'ry main When he sinks, would follow fain, Follow fain from west to east, And then from east to west again. Chorus. Follow would from west to east, And then from east to west again. Just. He beckon'd us, and then again was gone; Oh look! under the tree there, Livia— Where he sits—reading—scholar-like indeed!— With the dark hair that was so white upon His shoulder—but how deadly pale his face!— And, statue-still-like, the quaint evergreen Up and about him creeps, as one has seen Round some old marble in a lonely place. Luc. Aye, look on that—for, as the story runs, Ages ago, when all the world was young, That ivy was a nymph of Latium, Whose name was Hedera: so passing fair That all who saw fell doting on her; but Herself so icy-cruel, that her heart Froze dead all those her eyes had set on fire. Whom the just God who walk'd that early world, By, right-revenging metamorphosis Changed to a thing so abject-amorous, She grovels on the ground to catch at any Wither'd old trunk or sapling, in her way: So little loved as loath'd, for strangling those Round whom her deadly-deathless arms once close. Song. So for her who having lighted In another heart the fire, Then shall leave it unrequited In its ashes to expire: After her that sacrifice Through the garden burns and cries; In the sultry breathing air: In the flowers that turn and stare— “What has she to do among us, Falsely wise and frozen fair?” Luc. Listen, Justina, listen and beware. Just. Again! That voice too?—But you know my father Is ill—is in his chamber— How sultry 'tis—the street is full and close— Let us get home—why do they stare at us? And murmur something—“Cipriano?—Where “Is Cipriano?—lost to us—some say, “And to himself,—self-slain—mad—Where is he?” Alas, alas, I know not— Luc. Come and see— Justina (waking). Mercy upon me! Who is this? Luc. Justina, your good angel, Who, moved by your relenting to the sighs Of one who lost himself for your disdain, Will lead you to the cavern where he lies Subsisting on the memory of your eyes— Just. 'Twas all a dream!— Luc. That dreaming you fulfil. Just. Oh, no, with all my waking soul renounce. Luc. But, dreaming or awake, the soul is one, And the deed purposed in Heaven's eyes is done. Just. Oh Christ! I cannot argue—I can pray, Christ Jesus, oh, my Saviour, Jesu Christ! Let not hell snatch away from Thee the soul Thou gav'st Thy life to save!—Livia!—Livia! Enter Livia. Where is my father? where am I? Oh, I know— In my own chamber—and my father—oh!— But, Livia, who was it that but now Was here—here in my very chamber— Livia. Madam? Just. You let none in? oh, no! I know it—but Some one there was—here—now—as I cried out— A dark, strange figure— Livia. My child, compose yourself; No one has come, or gone, since you were laid In your noon-slumber. This was but a dream. The air is heavy; and the melancholy You live alone with since your father's death— Just. A dream, a dream indeed—oh Livia, That leaves his pressure yet upon my arm— And that without the immediate help of God I had not overcome—Oh, but the soul, The soul must be unsteady in the faith, So to be shaken even by a dream. Oh, were my father here! But he's at rest— I know he is—upon his Saviour's breast; And—who knows!—may have carried up my cries Ev'n to His ear upon whose breast he lies! Give me my mantle, Livia; I'll to the church; Where if but two or three are met in prayer Together, He has promised to be there— And I shall find Him. Livia. Oh, take care, take care! You know the danger—in broad daylight too— Or take me with you. Just. And endanger two? Best serve us both by keeping close at home, Praying for me as I will pray for you. Scene II. Entrance to the mountain cavern. Cipriano, in a magician's dress, with wand, &amp;c. What! do the powers of earth, and air, and hell, Against their upstart emperor rebel? Lo, in obedience to the rubric dark The dusky cheek of earth with mystic mark Of pentagram and circle I have lined, And hung my fetters on the viewless wind, And yet the star of stars, for whose ascent I ransack all the lower firmament, In unapparent darkness lags behind. Whom once again with adjuration new Of all the spirits whom these signs subdue, Whether by land or water, night or day, Whether awake or sleeping, yea or nay, I summon now before me.— Enter slowly a veiled Figure of Justina. The Figure. What dark spell From the sequester'd sadness of my cell, Through the still garden, through the giddy street, And up the solitary mountain-side, Leads me with sleep-involuntary feet?— Cipr. 'Tis she, as yet though clouded!—oh divine Justina!— The Figure. Cipriano!— Cipr. At last here, In such a chamber where ev'n Phœbus fails To pierce, and baffled breezes tell no tales, At last, to crown the labour of a year Of solitary toil and darkness—here!— And at a price beside—but none too dear— Oh year-long night well borne for such a day! Oh soul, for one such sense well sold away! Oh Now that makes for all the past amends, Oh moment that eternal life transcends To such a point of ecstasy, that just About to reap the wishes that requite All woes— The Figure (unveiling a skull and vanishing as it speaks). Behold, the World and its delight Is dust and ashes, dust and ashes, dust— Cipr. (flinging down his Wand). Lucifer! Lucifer! Lucifer!— Luc. My son! Cipr. Quick! With a word— How now?— With a word—at once— With all your might— Luc. Well, what with it?— Cipr. The charm— Shatter it! shatter it, I say!—Is't done? Is't vanisht— Luc. What has thus unsensed you? Cipr. Oh!— You know it—saw it—did it— Luc. Come—be a man: What, sacred with a mere death's-head? Cipr. Death's, indeed!— Luc. What was it more?— Cipr. Justina's seeming self— After what solitary labour wrought, And after what re-iterated charms, Step by step here in all her beauty brought Within the very circle of these arms, Then to death's grisly lineaments resign'd Slipt through them, and went wailing down the wind “Ashes and dust and ashes”— Nay, nay, pretend not that the fault was mine— The written incantation line by line I mutter'd, and the mystic figure drew; You only are to blame—you only, you, Cajoling me, or by your own cajoled, Bringing me fleshless death for the warm life For which my own eternal life is sold. Luc. You were too rash,—I warn'd you, and if not, Who thinks at a first trial to succeed? Another time— Cipr. No, no! No more of it! What, have I so long dabbled with the dead, That all I touch turns to corruption? Was it indeed herself—her living self— Till underneath my deadly contact slain; Or having died during the terrible year I have been living worse than dead with you, What I beheld not she, but what she was, Out of the tomb that only owns my spell Drawn into momentary lifeliness To mock me with the phantom of a beauty Whose lineaments the mere impalpable air Let in upon disfeatures—Was it she? Luc. She lives, and shall be yours. Cipr. Not if herself, In more than all her living beauty breathing, Came to efface that deadly counterfeit!— Oh, what have I been doing all this while, From which I wake as from a guilty dream, But with my guilt's accomplice at my side To prove its terrible reality! Where were my ears, my eyes, my senses! where The mother-wit which serves the common boor, Not to resent that black academy, Mess-mating with dead men and living fiends, And not to know no good could come of it!— My better self—the good that in me grew By nature, and by good instruction till'd, Under your shadow turn'd to poisonous weed; And ev'n the darker art you bribed me with, To master, if by questionable ways, The power I sigh'd for in my better days, So little reaching to the promised height, As sinking me beneath the lowest fiend, Who, for the inestimable self I sold, Pays the false self you made me with false gold! Luc. When will blind fury, falling foul of all, Light where it should? Suppose a fault so far, As knowledge working through unpractised hands Might fail at first encounter; all men know How a mere sand will check a vast machine; And in these complicated processes An agency so insignificant As to be wholly overlookt it was At the last moment foil'd us. Cipr. But she lives! Lives—from your clutches saved, and saved from mine— Ev'n from that only shadow of my guilt That could have touch'd her, saved—unguilty shame, That now is left with all the guilt to me. Oh that I knew a God in all the heav'ns To thank, or ev'n of Tartarus—ev'n thee, Thee would I bless, whatever power it be That with that shadow saved her, and mock'd me Back to my better senses. If not she, What was it? Luc. What you saw. Cipr. A phantom? Luc. Well, A phantom. Cipr. But how raised? Luc. What if by her? She is a sorcerer as her father was. Cipr. A sorcerer! She a sorcerer! oh, black lie To whiten your defeat! and, were it true, Oh mighty doctor to be foil'd at last By a mere woman!—If a sorcerer, Then of a sort you deal not with, nor hell— And ev'n Olympus likes the sport too well— Raising a phantom not to draw me down To deeper sin, but with its ghastly face And hollow voice both telling of the tomb They came from, warning me of what complexion Were all the guilty wishes of this world. But let the phantom go where gone it is— Not of what mock'd me, but what saved herself, By whatsoever means—aye, what was it, That pitiful agency you told me of So insignificant, as overlookt At the last moment thwarted us? Luc. What matter? When now provided for, and which when told You know not— Cipr. Which I will be told to know— For as one ris'n from darkness tow'rd the light, A veil seems clearing from before my sight— She is a sorcerer, and of the kind That old Lisandro died suspected of?— Oh cunning doctor, to outwit yourself, Outwitted as you have been, and shall be By him who if your devilish magic fail'd To teach its purposed mischief, Thus on his teacher turns it back in full To force him to confess the counter-power That foil'd us both. (He catches up his wand.) Luc. Poor creature that you are! Did not the master from his scholars hold One sleight of hand that masters all the rest, What magic needed to compel the devil To convict those who find him out too late? Yet to increase your wrath by leaving it Blind in the pit your guilt consigns you to, I shall not answer— Cipr. Then if your own hell Cannot enforce you; by that Unknown Power That saved Justina from your fangs, although Yourself you cannot master, if you know, I charge you name him to me!— Luc. (after a great flash of lightning, and thunder). Jesus Christ! Cipr. (after a pause). Ev'n so!—Christ Jesus—Jesus Christ—the same That poor Lisandro died suspected of, And I had heard and read of with the rest But to despise, in spite of all the blood By which the chosen few their faith confest— The prophet-carpenter of Nazareth, Poor, persecuted, buffeted, reviled, Spit upon, crown'd with thorns, and crucified With thieves—the Son of God—the Son of man, Whose shape He took to teach them how to live, And doff'd upon the cross to do away The sin and death you and your devil-deities Had heap'd on him from the beginning? Luc. Yea!— Cipr. Of the one sun of Deity one ray That was before the world was, and that made The world and all that is within it? Luc. Yea! Cipr. Eternal and Almighty then: and yet Infinite Centre as he is of all The all but infinite universe he made, With eyes to see me plotting, and with ear To hear one solitary creature pray, From one dark corner of his kingdom? Luc. Yea! Cipr. All one, all when, all where, all good, all mighty, All eye, all ear, all self-integrity— Methinks this must be He of whom I read In Greek and Roman sages dimly guess'd, But never until now fully confest In this poor carpenter of Nazareth, With poor Justina for his confessor— And now by thee—by thee—once and again Spite of thyself—for answer me you must, Convicted at the bar of your own thunder— Is this the God for whom I sought so long In mine own soul and those of other men, Who from the world's beginning till to-day Groped or were lost in utter darkness? Luc. Yea! Cipr. Enough; and your confession shall be mine— Luc. And to like purpose; to believe, confess, And tremble, in the everlasting fire Prepared for all who Him against their will Confess, and in their deeds deny him— Cipr. Oh, Like a flogg'd felon after full confession Releast at last! Luc. To bind you mine for ever. Cipr. Thine! What art thou? Luc. The god whom you must worship. Cipr. There is no God but one, whom you and I Alike acknowledge, as in Jesus Christ Reveal'd to man. What other god art thou? Luc. Antichrist! He that all confessing Christ Confess; Satan, the Serpent, the first Tempter, Who tempted the first Father of mankind With the same offer to a like result That I have tempted thee with; yea, had power Even Him in his humanity to tempt, Though Him in vain; the god of this world; if False god, true devil; true angel as I was, Son of the morning, Lucifer, who fell (As first I told thee, had'st thou ears to hear) For my rebellion down from heaven to hell More terrible than any Tartarus, Where over those who fell with me I reign. Whom, though with them bound in the self-same chain Of everlasting torment, God allows To reach my hands out of my prison-house On all who like me from their God rebel, As thou hast done. Cipr. Not when for God I knew him. Luc. Aye, but who but for pride and lust like mine Had known Him sooner— Cipr. And had sooner known But for thy lying gods that shut Him out. Luc. Which others much less wise saw through before. Cipr. All happy they then! But all guilty I, Yet thus far guiltless of denying Him Whom even thou confessest. Luc. But too late— Already mine, if not so sworn before, Yet by this bond— Cipr. For service unperform'd! But unperform'd, or done, and payment due, I fling myself and all my debt on Him Who died to undertake them— Luc. He is the Saviour of the innocent, Not of the guilty. Cipr. Who alone need saving! Luc. Damnation is the sinner's just award, And He is just. Cipr. And being just, will not For wilful blindness tax the want of light: And All-good as Almighty, and therefore As merciful as just, will not renounce Ev'n the worst sinner who confesses Him, And testifies confession with his blood. Which, not to waste a moment's argument, Too like the old logic that I lost my life in, And hangs for ever dead upon the cross; I will forthwith shout my confession, Into the general ear of Antioch, And from the evidence of thine own mouth, Not thee alone, but all thy lying gods, Convict; and you convicting before God, Myself by man's tribunal judged and damn'd, Trust by my own blood mixing with the tide That flow'd for me from the Redeemer's side, From those few damning drops to wash me free That bound me thine for ever— Lucifer (seizing him). Take my answer— Cipriano (escaping). Oh, Saviour of Justina, save Thou me! SCENE III. The Hall of Justice in Antioch; Aurelio, Fabio, Senators, &amp;c., just risen from Council. Aurelio. You have done well indeed; the very Church These Christians flock'd to for safe blasphemy Become the very net to catch them in. How many, think you? Fabio. Not so many, sir, As some that are of the most dangerous. Aur. Among the rest this girl, Lisandro's daughter, As you and I know, Fabio, to our cost: But now convicted and condemn'd is safe From troubling us or Antioch any more. Come, such good service asks substantial thanks; What shall it be? Fabio. No other, if you please, Than my son Floro's liberation, Whom not without good reason for so long You keep under the city's lock and key. Aur. As my own Lelio, and for a like cause; Who both distracted by her witchery Turn'd from fast friends to deadly enemies, And, in each other's lives, so aimed at ours. But no more chance of further quarrel now For one whom Death anticipates for bride Ere they again gird weapon at their side, Set them both free forthwith.— [Exit Fabio. This cursèd woman whose fair face and foul Behaviour was the city's talk and trouble, Now proved a sorceress, is well condemn'd; Not only for my sake and Fabio's, But for all Antioch, whose better youth She might, like ours, have carried after her Through lust and duel into blasphemy. Re-enter Fabio with Lelio and Floro. Lelio. Once more, sir, at your feet— Aur. Up, both of you. Floro and Lelio, you understand What I have done was of no testy humour, But for three several sakes— Your own, your fathers', and the city's peace. Henceforward, by this seasonable use Of public law for private purpose check'd, Your fiery blood to better service turn. Take hands, be friends; the cause of quarrel gone— Lelio. The cause of quarrel gone!— Aur. Be satisfied; You will know better by and bye; meanwhile Taking upon my word that so it is; Which were it not indeed, you were not here To doubt. Floro (aside). Oh flimsy respite of revenge!— Aur. And now the business of the day well crown'd With this so happy reconciliation, You and I, Fabio, to our homes again, Our homes once more, replenish'd with the peace We both have miss'd so long.—What noise is that? (Cries without). Stop him! A madman! Stop him!— Aur. What is it, Fabio? Fabio. One like mad indeed, In a strange garb, with flaring eyes, and hair That streams behind him as he flies along, Dragging a cloud of rabble after him. Aur. This is no place for either—shut the doors, And post the soldiers to keep peace without— (Cries without). Stop him! Floro and Lelio. 'Tis Cipriano!— Aur. Cipriano!— Enter Cipriano. Cipriano. Aye, Cipriano, Cipriano's self, Heretofore mad as you that call him so, Now first himself.—Noble Aurelio, Who sway'st the sword of Rome in Antioch; And you, companions of my youthful love And letters; you grave senate ranged above; And you whose murmuring multitude below Do make the marble hall of justice rock From base to capital—hearken unto me: Yes, I am Cipriano: I am he So long and strangely lost, now strangely found— The famous doctor of your schools, renown'd Not Antioch only but the world about For learning's prophet-paragon forsooth; Who long pretending to provide the truth For other men in fields where never true Wheat, but a crop of mimic darnel grew, Reap'd nothing for himself but doubt, doubt, doubt. Then 'twas that looking with despair and ruth Over the blasted harvest of my youth, I saw Justina: saw, and put aside The barren Pallas for a mortal bride Divinelier fair than she is feign'd to be: But in whose deep-entempled chastity That look'd down holy cold upon my fire, Lived eyes that but re-doubled vain desire. Till this new passion, that more fiercely prey'd Upon the wither'd spirit of dismay'd Ambition, swiftly by denial blew To fury that, transcending all control, I made away the ruin of my soul To one whom no chance tempest at my feet In the mid tempest of temptation threw. Who blinding me with the double deceit Of loftier aspiration and more low Than mortal or immortal man should owe Fulfill'd for me, myself for his I bound; With him and death and darkness closeted In yonder mountain, while about its head The sun his garland of the seasons wound, In the dark school of magic I so read, And wrought to such a questionable power The black forbidden art I travail'd in, That though the solid mountain from his base With all his forest I might counterplace, I could not one sweet solitary flower Of beauty to my magic passion win. Because her God was with her in that hour To guard her virtue more than mountain-fast: That only God, whom all my learning past Fail'd to divine, but from the very foe That would have kept Him from me come to know, I come to you, to witness and make known: One God, eternal, absolute, alone; Of whom Christ Jesus—Jesus Christ, I say— And, Antioch, open all your ears to-day— Of that one Godhead one authentic ray, Vizor'd awhile his Godhead in man's make, Man's sin and death upon Himself to take; For man made man; by man unmade and slain Upon the cross that for mankind He bore— Dead—buried—and in three days ris'n again To His hereditary glory, bearing All who with Him on earth His sorrow sharing With Him shall dwell in glory evermore. And all the gods I worship'd heretofore, And all that you now worship and adore, From thundering Zeus to cloven-footed Pan, But lies and idols, by the hand of man Of brass and stone—fit emblems as they be, With ears that hear not; eyes that cannot see; And multitude where only One can be— From man's own lewd imagination built; By that same devil held to that old guilt Who tempted me to new. To whom indeed If with my sin and blood myself I fee'd For ever his—that bond of sin and blood I trust to cancel in the double flood Of baptism past, and the quick martyrdom To which with this confession I am come. Oh delegate of Cæsar to devour The little flock of Jesus Christ! Behold One lost sheep just admitted to the fold Through the pure stream that rolling down the same Mountain in which I sinn'd, and as I came By holy hands administer'd, to-day Shall wash the mountain of my sin away. Lo, here I stand for judgment; by the blow Of sudden execution, or such slow Death as the devil shall, to maintain his lies, By keeping life alive in death, devise. Hack, rack, dismember, burn—or crucify, Like Him who died to find me; Him that I Will die to find; for whom, with whom, to die Is life; and life without, and all his lust, But dust and ashes, dust and ashes, dust— (He falls senseless to the ground.) Aurelio (after a long pause). So public and audacious blasphemy Demands as instant vengeance. Wretched man, Arise and hear your sentence— Lelio. Oh, sir, sir! You speak to ice and marble—Cipriano! Oh lookt for long, and best for ever lost! But he is mad—he knows not what he says— You would not, surely, on a madman visit What only sane confession makes a crime? Aur. I never know how far such blasphemy, Which seems to spread like wild-fire in the world, Be fault or folly: only this I know, I dare not disobey the stern decree That Cæsar makes my office answer for. Especially when one is led away Of such persuasion and authority, Still drawing after him the better blood Of Antioch, to better or to worse. Lelio. Cipriano! Cipriano! Yet, pray the gods He be past hearing me! Fabio (to Aurelio). Sir, in your ear— Justina's hour is come; and through the room Where she was doom'd, she passes to her doom. Aur. Let us be gone; they must not look on her, Nor know she is to die until “to die” Be past predicament. Here let her wait, Till he she drew along with her to sin Revive to share with her its punishment. Come, Lelio—come, Floro—be assured I loved and honour'd this man as yourselves Have honour'd him—but now— Lelio. Nay, sir, but— Aur. Nay, Not I, but Cæsar, Lelio. Come away. [Exeunt. Then Justina is brought in by soldiers, and left alone.] Just. All gone—all silence—and the sudden stroke, Whose only mercy I besought, delay'd To make my pang the fiercer.—What is here?— Dead?—By the doom perhaps I am to die, And laid across the threshold of the road To trip me up with terror—Yet not so, If but the life, once lighted here, has flown Up the the living Centre that my own Now trembles to!—God help him, breathing still?— —Cipriano!— Cipr. Aye, I am ready—I can rise— Is my time come?—Oh, God! Have I repented and confest too late, And this terrible witness of my crime Stands at the door of death from which it came To draw me deeper— Just. Cipriano! Cipr. Yet Not yet disfeatured—nor the voice— Oh, if not That—this time unsummon'd—come To take me with you where I raised you from— Once more—once more—assure me!— Justina (taking his hand). Cipriano!— Cipr. And this, too, surely, is a living hand: Though cold, oh, cold indeed—but yet, but yet, Not dust and ashes, dust and ashes— Just. No— But soon to be— Cipr. But soon—but soon to be— But not as then?— Just. I understand you not— Cipr. I scarce myself—I must have been asleep— But now not dreaming? Just. No, not dreaming. Cipr. No— This is the judgment-hall of Antioch, In which—I scarcely mind how long ago— Is sentence pass'd on me?— Just. This is indeed The judgment-hall of Antioch; but why You here, and what the judgment you await, I know not— Cipr. No.—But stranger yet to me Why you yourself, Justina.—Oh my God! It flashes all across me! What, all your life long giving God his due, Is treason unto Cæsar?— Just. Aye, Cipriano— Against his edict having crept inside God's fold with that good Shepherd for my guide, My Saviour Jesus Christ! Cipr. My Saviour too, And Shepherd—oh, the only good and true Shepherd and Saviour— Just. You confess Him! You Confess Him, Cipriano! Cipr. With my blood: Which being all to that confession pledged, Now waits but to be paid. Just. Oh, we shall die, And go to heav'n together! Cipr. Amen! Amen!— And yet— Just. You do not fear—and yet no shame— What I have faced so long, that present dread Is almost lost in long anticipation— Cipr. I fear not for this mortal. Would to God This guilty blood by which in part I trust To pay the forfeit of my soul with Heav'n Would from man's hand redeem the innocence That such atonement needs not. Just. Oh, to all One faith and one atonement— Cipr. But if both, If both indeed must perish by the doom That one deserves and cries for—Oh, Justina, Who upward ever with the certain step Of faith hast follow'd unrepress'd by sin; Now that thy foot is almost on the floor Of heav'n, pray Him who opens thee the door, Let with thee one repenting sinner in! Just. What more am I? And were I close to Him As he upon whose breast he leaned on here, No intercessor but Himself between Himself and the worst sinner of us all— If but repenting we believe in Him. Cipr. I do believe—I do repent—my faith Have sign'd in water, and will seal in blood— Just. I have no other hope, but, in that, all. Cipr. Oh hope that almost is accomplishment, Believing all with nothing to repent! Just. Oh, none so good as not to need—so bad As not to find, His mercy. If you doubt Because of your long dwelling in the darkness To which the light was folly—oh 'twas shown To the poor shepherd long before the wise; And if to me, as simple—oh, not mine, Not mine, oh God! the glory—nor ev'n theirs From whom I drew it, and—Oh, Cipriano, Methinks I see them bending from the skies To take me up to them! Cipr. Whither could I But into heaven's remotest corner creep, Where I might only but discern thee, lost With those you love in glory— Just. Hush! hush! hush! These are wild words—if I so speak to one So wise, while I am nothing— But as you know—Oh, do not think of me, But Him, into whose kingdom all who come Are as His angels— Cipr. Aye, but to come there!— Where if all intercession, even thine, Be vain—you say so—yet before we pass The gate of death together, as we shall,— If then to part—for ever, and for ever— Unless with your forgiveness in my hand— But say that you forgive me!— Just. I forgive! Still I, and I, again! Oh, Cipriano, Pardon and intercession both alike With Him alone; and had I to forgive— Did not He pray upon the cross for those Who slew Him—as I hope to do on mine For mine—He bids us bless our enemies And persecutors; which I think, I think, You were not, Cipriano—why do you shudder?— Save in pursuit of that—if vain to me, Now you know all— Cipr. I now know all—but you Not that, which asking your forgiveness for, I dare not name to you, for fear the hand I hold as anchor-fast to, break away, And I drive back to hell upon a blast That roar'd behind me to these very doors, But stopt—ev'n in the very presence stopt, That most condemns me his. Just. Alas, alas, Again all wild to me. The time draws short— Look not to me, but Him tow'rd whom alone Sin is, and pardon comes from— Cipr. Oh, Justina, You know not how enormous is my sin— Just. I know, not as His mercy infinite. Cipr. To Him—to thee—to Him through thee— Just. 'Tis written, Not all the sand of ocean, nor the stars Of heav'n so many as His mercies are. Cipr. What! ev'n for one who, mad with pouring vows Into an unrelenting human ear, Gave himself up to Antichrist—the Fiend— Though then for such I knew him not—to gain By darkness all that love had sought in vain! —Speak to me—if but that hereafter I Shall never, never, hear your voice again— Speak to me— Just. (after a long pause). —By the Saviour on His cross A sinner hung who but at that last hour Cried out to be with Him; and was with Him In Paradise ere night. Cipr. But was his sin As mine enormous?— Just. Shall your hope be less, Offering yourself for Christ's sake on that cross The other only suffer'd for his sin? Oh, when we come to perish, side by side, Look but for Him between us crucified, And call to Him for mercy; and, although Scarlet, your sin shall be as white as snow! Cipr. Ev'n as you speak, yourself, though yet yourself, In that full glory that you saw reveal'd With those you love transfigured, and your voice As from immeasurable altitude Descending, tell me that, my shame and sin Quencht in the death that opens wide to you The gate, ev'n this great sinner shall pass through, With Him, with them, with thee!— Just. Glory to God!— Oh blest assurance on the very verge That death is swallow'd up in victory! And hark! the step of death is at the door— Courage!—Almighty God through Jesus Christ Pardon your sins and mine, and as a staff Guide and support us through the terrible pass That leads us to His rest!— Cipr. My own beloved! Whose hand—Oh let it be no sin to say it!— Is as the staff that God has put in mine— To lead me through the shadow—yet ev'n now— Ev'n now—at this last terrible moment— Which, to secure my being with thee, thee Forbids to stand between my Judge and me, And in a few more moments, soul and soul May read each other as an open scroll— Yet, wilt thou yet believe me not so vile To thee, to Him who made thee what thou art, Till desperation of the only heart I ever sigh'd for, by I knew not then How just alienation, drove me down To that accursèd thing? Just. My Cipriano! Dost thou remember, in the lighter hour— Then when my heart, although you saw it not, All the while yearn'd to thee across the gulf That yet it dared not pass—my telling thee That only Death, which others disunites, Should ever make us one? Behold! and now The hour is come, and I redeem my vow. (Here the play may finish: but for any one who would follow Calderon to the end,—Enter Fabio with Guard, who lead away Cipriano and Justina. Manent Eusebio, Julian, and Citizens.) Citizen 1. Alas! alas! alas! So young a pair! And one so very wise! Cit. 2. And one so fair! Cit. 3. And both as calmly walking to their death As others to a marriage festival. Julian. Looking as calm, at least, Eusebio, As when, do you remember, at the last Great festival of Zeus, we left him sitting Upon the hill-side with his books? Eusebio. I think Almost the last we saw of him: so soon, Flinging his studies and his scholars by, He went away into that solitude Which ended in this madness, and now death With her he lost his wits for. Cit. 1. And has found In death whom living he pursued in vain. Cit. 2 And after death, as they believe; and so Thus cheerfully to meet it, if the scaffold Divorce them to eternal union. Cit. 3. Strange that so wise a man Should fall into so fond a superstition Which none but ignorance has taken up. Cit. Oh, love, you know, like time works wonders. Eusebio. Well— Antioch will never see so great a scholar. Julian. Nor we so courteous a Professor— I would not see my dear old master die Were all the wits he lost my legacy. Citizens talking. One says that, as they went out hand in hand, He saw a halo like about the moon About their head, and moving as they went. Citizens talking. I saw it— Fancy! fancy!— Any how, They leave it very dark behind them—Thunder! They talk of madness and of blasphemy; Neither of these, I think, looking much guilty. And he, at any rate, I still maintain, Least like to be deluded by the folly For which the new religion is condemn'd. Before his madness, certainly: but love First crazed him, as I told you. Well, if mad, How guilty? Hush! hush! These are dangerous words. Be not you bitten by this madness, neighbour. Rome's arm is long. Aye, and some say her ears. Then, ev'n if bitten, bark not—Thunder again! And what unnatural darkness! Well—a storm— They say, you know, he was a sorcerer— Indeed we saw the mystic dress he wore All wrought with figures of astrology; Nay, he confest himself as much; and now May raise a storm to save— There was a crash! A bolt has fallen somewhere—the walls shake— And the ground under— Save us, Zeus— Voices. Away!— The roof is falling in upon us— (The wall at the back falls in, and discovers a scaffold with Cipriano and Justina dead, and Lucifer above them.) Lucifer. Stay!— And hearken to what I am doom'd to tell. I am the mighty minister of hell You mis-call heav'n, and of the hellish crew Of those false gods you worship for the True; Who, to revenge her treason to the blind Idolatry that has hoodwinkt mankind, And his, whose halting wisdom after-knew What her diviner virtue fore-divined, By devilish plot and artifices thought Each of them by the other to have caught; But, thwarted by superior will, those eyes That, by my fuel fed, had been a flame To light them both to darkness down, became As stars to lead together to the skies, By such a doom as expiates his sin, And her pure innocence lets sooner in To that eternal bliss where, side by side, They reign at His right hand for whom they died. While I, convicted in my own despite Thus to bear witness to the eternal light Of which I lost, and they have won the crown, Plunge to my own eternal darkness down. Húndese.</field>
