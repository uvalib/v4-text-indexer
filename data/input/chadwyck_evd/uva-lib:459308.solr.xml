      <field name="fulltext">THE COMICALL HISTORIE OF Alphonsus, King of Aragon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. After you haue sounded thrise, let Venus be let downe from the top of the Stage, and when she is downe, say. Poets are scarce when Goddesses themselues Are forst to leaue their high and stately seates Placed on top of high Olympus Mount, To seeke them out, to pen their Champions praise. The time hath bene when Homers sugred Muse, Did make each Eccho to repeate his verse, That euery coward that durst crack a speare, And Tilt and Turney for his Ladies sake, Was painted out in colours of such price As might become the proudest Potentate. But now a dayes so yrksome Idels slights, And cursed charmes haue witch'd each students mind, That death it is to any of them all, If that their hands to penning you do call: Oh Uirgil, Virgil, wert thou now aliue, Whose painfull pen in stout Augustus dayes, Did daigne to let the base and silly flea To scape away without thy praise of her. I do not doubt but long or ere this time, Alphonsus fame vnto the heauen's should clime: Alphonsus fame that man of Ioue his seed, Sprung from the loines of the immortall Gods, Whose sire although he habit on the earth, May claime a pottion in the fierie Pole, As well as any one what ere he be. But setting by Alphonsus power diuine, What man aliue or now amongst the ghoasts Could counteruaile his courage and his strength? But thou art dead, yea Virgil thou art gon: And all his acts drownd in obliuion. And all his acts drownd in obliuion? No Uenus no, though Poets proue vnkind, And loth to stand in penning of his deeds, Yet rather then they shall be cleane forgot, I which was wont to sollow Cupids games Will put in vre Mineruaes sacred Art, And this my hand which vsed for to pen The praise of loue, and Cupids peerles power, Will now begin to treat of bloudie Mars, Of doughtie deeds and valiant victories. Enter Melpomine, Clio, Errato, with their sisters, playing all vp-vpon sundrie Instruments, Calliope onely excepted, who comming last, hangeth downe the head, and plaies not of her Instrument. But see whereas the stately Muses come, Whose harmony doth very far surpasse The heauenly musick of Appolloes pipe. But what meanes this Melpomine her selfe With all her sisters sound their Instruments, Onely excepted faire Calliope? Who comming last &amp; hanging downe her head, Doth plainly shewe by outward actions What secret sorrow doth torment her heart. Stands aside. Mel. Calliope thou which so oft didst crake, How that such clients clustred to thy Court By thick and threefold, as not any any one Of all thy sisters might compare with thee: Where be thy schollers now become I troe? Where are they vanisht in such suddain sort, That while as we do play vpon our strings, You stand still lazing, and haue nought to do? Clio. Melpomine make you a why of that? I know full oft you haue Authors red, The higher tree the sooner is his fall, And they which first do flourish and beare sway, Vpon the sudden vanish cleane away. Cal. Mocke on apace, my backe is broad enough To beare your flouts as many as they be. That yeare is rare, that nere feeles winters stormes: That tree is fertile which nere wanteth frute. And that same Muse hath heaped well in store: Which neuer wanteth clients at her doore. But yet my sisters, when the surgent seas Haue ebde their fill, their waues do rise againe And fill their bankes vp to the very brimmes: And when my pipe hath easd her selfe a while, Such store of suters shall my seate frequent, That you shall see my schollers be not spent. Errato. Spent (quoth you) sister, then we were too blame If we should say your schollers all were spent: But pray now tell me when your painfull pen will rest enough? Mel. When husbandmen sheere hogs. Ven. Melpomine, Errato and the rest, From thickest shrubs dame Venus did espie The mortall hatred which you ioyntly beare Vnto your sister high Calliope. What do you thinke if that the tree do bend, It followes therefore that it needs must breakes And since her pipe a litle while doth rest, It neuer shall be able for to sound? Yes Muses yes, if that she will vouchsafe To entertaine Dame Venus in her schoole, And further me with her instructions, She shall haue schollers which wil daine to be In any other Muses companie. Calliope. Most sacred Venus do you doubt of that? Calliope would thinke her three times blest, For to receiue a Goddes in her schoole, Especially so high an one as you, Which rules the earth, and guides the heauens too. Ven. Then sound your pipes, and let vs bend our steps Vnto the top of high Pernassus hill, And there togither do our best deuoyr For to describe Alphonsus warlike fame: And in the maner of a Comedie, Set downe his noble valour presently. Calli. As Venus wils, so bids Calliope. Melpo. And as you bid your sisters do agree. Exeunt. Enter Clarinus the Father, and Alphonsus his sonne. Carinus. My noble sonne, since first I did recount The noble acts your predecessors did In Aragon, against their warlike foes, I neuer yet could see thee ioy at all, But hanging downe thy head as malcontent: Thy youthfull dayes in mourning haue bene spent. Tell me Alphonsus what might be the cause That makes thee thus to pine away with care? Hath old Carinus done thee any offence In reckning vp these stories vnto thee? What nere word but mumme? Alphonsus speake, Vnles your Fathers fatall day you seeke. Alphon. Although deare father I haue often vowde Nere to vnfold the secrets of my heart To any man or woman, who some ere Dwels vnderneath the circle of the skie: Yet do your words so coniure me deare sire, That needs I must fulfil that you require. Then so it is, amongst the famous tales Which you rehearst done by our sires in warre, When as you came vnto your fathers daies, With sobbing notes, with sighs &amp; blubbring teares, And much ado, at length you thus began. Next to Alphonsus should my father come, For to possesse the Diadem by right Of Aragon, but that the wicked wretch His yonger brother, with aspiring mind, By secret treason robd him of his life, And me his sonne, of that which was my due. These words my sire, did so torment my mind, As had I bene with Ixion in hell, The rauening bird could neuer plague me worse: For euer since my mind hath troubled bene Which way I might reuenge this traiterous fact, And that recouer which is ours by right. Cari. Ah my Alphonsus neuer thinke on that, In vaine it is to striue against the streame, The Crowne is lost, and now in bucksters hands, And all our hope is cast into the dust: Bridle these thoughts, and learne the same of me, A quiet life doth passe an Emperie. Alphon. Yet noble father, ere Carinus brood Shall brooke his foe for to vsurpe his seate, Heele die the death with honour in the field, And so his life and sorrowes briefly end. But did I know my froward fate were such, As I should faile in this my iust attempt: This sword deare father should the Author be, To make an end of this my Tragedie. Therefore sweet sire, remaine you here a while, And let me walke my Fortune for to trie: I do not doubt but ere the time be long, Ile quite his cost, or else my selfe will die. Cari. My noble sonne, since that thy mind is such For to reuenge thy fathers foule abuse, As that my words may not a whit preuaile To stay thy iourney, go with happie fate, And soone returne vnto thy fathers Cell, With such a traine as Iulius CÃ¦sar came To noble Rome, when as he had atchiu'd The mightie Monarch of the triple world, Meane time Carinus in this sillie groue Will spend his daies with praiers and horizons, To mightie Ioue, to further thine intent: Farewell deare sonne Alphonsus, fare you well. Exit. Alphon. And is he gone? then hie Alphonsus hie, To trie thy fortune where thy fates do call: A noble mind disdaines to hide his head, And let his foes triumph in his ouerthrow. Enter Albinius. Alphonsus make as though thou goest out, Albinius say. Albi. What loytring follow haue we spied here? Presume not villaine further for to go, Vnles you do at length the same repent. Alphonsus comes towards Albinius. Alphon. Villain saist thou, nay vilain in thy throat: What knowst thou skipinck whom thou vilain calst? Albi. A common vassall I do villaine call. Alphon. That shalt thou soone approoue perswade thy self, Or else ile die, or thou shalt die for me. Albi. What do I dreame, or do my dazeling eies Deceiue me? Ist Alphonsus that I see? Doth now Medea vse her wonted charmes For to delude Albinius fantasie? Or doth black Pluto king of darke Auerne, Seeke to flout me with his counterfait? His bodie like to Alphonsus framed is: His face resembles much Alphonsus hewe: His noble mind declares him for no les. Tis he indeed, wo worth Albinius, Whose babling tong hath causde his owne annoy. Why doth not Ioue send from the glittring skies His Thunderbolts to chastice this offence? Why doth dame Terra cease with greedie iawes To swallow vp Albinius presently? What shall I flie and hide my trayterous head, From stout Alphonsus whom I so misusde? Or shall I yeeld. Tush yeelding is in vaine: Nor can I flie, but he will follow me. Then cast thy selfe downe at his graces feete, Confesse thy fault, and readie make thy brest, To entertaine thy well deserued death. Albinius kneeles downe. Alph. What newes my friend? why are you so blanke That earst before did vaunt it to the skies? Albi. Pardon deare Lord, Albinius pardon craues For this offence, which by the heauens I vowe, Vnwittingly I did vnto your grace. For had I knowne Alphonsus had bene here, Ere that my tongue had spoke so trayterously, This hand should make my very soule to die. Alphon. Rise vp my friend, thy pardon soon is got: But prithie tell me what the cause might be; That in such sort thou erst vpbraidest me? Albinius rises vp. Albi. Most mightie Prince, since first your fathers sire Did yeeld his ghost vnto the sisters three, And olde Carinus forced was to flie, His natiue soyle, and royall Diadem, I for because I seemed to complaine Against their treason, shortly was forewarnd, Nere more to haunt the bounds of Aragon, On paine of death, then like a man forlorne I sought about to find some resting place, And at the length did happe vpon this shore Where she wing forth my cruell banishment, By King Belinus I am succoured. But now my Lord to answere your demaund, It happens so, that the vsurping King Of Aragon, makes warre vpon this land, For certaine tribute which he claymeth heere, Wherefore Belinus sent me round about His Countrey for to gather vp men. For to withstand this most iniurious foe, Which being done, returning with the king, Dispightfully I did so taunt your grace, Imagining you had some souldier bene, The which for feare had sneaked from the Campe. Alphon. Inough Albinius, I do know thy mind: But may it be, that these thy happie newes, Should be of truth, or haue you forged them? Albi. The gods forbid that ere Albinius tongue Should once be found to forge a fayned tale, Especially vnto his soueraigne Lord: But if Alphonsus thinke that I do faine, Stay here a while, and you shall plainely see, My words be true, when as you do perceiue Our royall armie march before your face, The which ift please my Noble Lord to stay, Ile hasten on with all the speed I may. Alphon. Make haste Albinius, if you loue my life, But yet beware when as your Armie comes, You do not make as though you do me know, For I a while a souldier base will be, Vntill I finde time more conuenient To shew Albinius, what is mine intent. Albi. What ere Alphonsus fittest doth esteeme, Albinius for his profit best will deeme. Exit. Alphon. Now do I see both Gods and fortune to Do ioyne their powers to raise Alphonsus fame: For in this broyle I do not greatly doubt, But that I shall my Couzens courage tame. But see whereas Belinus Armie comes, And he himselfe vnlesse I gesse awrie: Who ere it be I do not passe a pinne, Alphonsus meanes his souldier for to be. Enter Belinus King of Naples, Albinius, Fabius, marching with their souldiers. Beli. Thus farre my Lords wee trained haue our Campe, For to encounter haughtie Arragon, Who with a mightie power of stragling mates, Hath trayterously assayled this our land, And burning Townes and sacking Cities faire, Doth play the diuell where some ere he comes. Now as we are informed by our scoutes, He marcheth on vnto our cheefest feate, Naples I meane, that Citie of renowme, For to begirt it with his bands about: And so at length, the which high Ioue forbid, To sacke the same as earst he other did. If which should happe, Belinus were vndone, His countrey spoyld, and all his subiect slaine: Wherefore your soueraigne thinketh it most meet, For to preuent the furie of the foe, And Naples succour, that distressed Towne, By entring in, ere Aragon doth come, With all our men, which will sufficient be, For to withstand their cruell batterie. Albi. The sillie serpent found by Country swaine, And cut in peeces by his furious blowes, Yet if his head do scape away vntoucht, As many write, it very stranglye goes, To fetch an herbe, with which in litle time, Her battered corpes againe she doth conioyne: But if by chance the ploughmans sturdie staffe, Do happe to hit vpon the Serpents head, And bruse the same, though all the rest be sound, Yet doth the sillie serpent lie for dead: Nor can the rest of all her body serue, To finde a salue which may her life preserue. Euen so my Lord, if Naples once be lost, Which is the head of all your graces land, Easie it were, for the malicious foe, To get the other Cities in their hand: But if from them, that Naples Towne be free, I do not doubt, but safe the rest shall bee. And therefore mightie King, I thinke it best, To succour Naples, rather then the rest. Beli. Tis brauely spoken, by my Crowne I sweare, I like thy counsell and will follow it. Point toward Alphonsus. But harke Albinius, dost thou know the man, That doth so closely ouer thwart vs stand? Albi. Not I my Lord nor neuer saw him yet. Beli. Then prithie goe, and aske him presently, What countrey man he is, and why he comes Into this place, perhaps he is some one, That is sent hither as a secret spie, To heare and see in secret what we do. Albinius and Fabius go toward Alphonsus. Albi. My friend, what art thou, that so like a spie, Dost sneake about Belinus royall Campe? Alphon. I am a man. Fabi. A man? we know the same: But prithee tell me, and set scoffing by, What country man thou art, and why you come, That we may soone resolue the King thereof? Alphon. Why say, I am a souldier. Fabi. Of whose band? Alphon. Of his that will most wages to me giue. Fabi. But will you be content to serue Belinus in his wars? Alphon. I if he will reward me as I do deserue, And grant what ere I winne, it shall be mine incontinent. Albi. Beleeue me sir, your seruice costly is: But stay a while, and I will bring you word, What King Belinus sayes vnto the same. Albinius go towards Alphonsus. Beli. What newes Albinius, who is that we see? Albi. It is my Lord, a souldier that you see, Who faine would serue your grace in these your warres, But that I feare, his seruice is too deare. Beli. Too deare, why so? what doth the souldier craue? Albi. He craues my Lord, all things that with his sword He doth obtaine what euer that they be. Beli. Content my friend, if thou wilt succour me, What ere you get, that challenge as thine owne, Belinus giues it franckly vnto thee: Although it be the Crowne of Aragon. Come on therefore, and let vs hie apace, To Naples Towne, whereas by this I know, Our foes haue pitcht their tents against our walles. March on my Lord, for I will follow you, And do not doubt but ere the time be long, I shall obtaine the Crowne of Aragon. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. Of the Historie of Alphonsus. Enter Belinus, Albinius, Fabius, Alphonsus, with the souldier, assoone as they are in, strike vp alarum a while, and then enter Venus. Venus. Thus from the pit of pilgrimes pouertie, Alphonsus ginnes by step and step, to climbe Vnto the toppe of friendly Fortunes wheele, From banisht state as you haue plainely seene, He is transformed into a souldiers life, And marcheth in the Ensigne of the King, Of worthy Naples, which Belinus hight, Not for because that he doth loue him so, But that he may reuenge him on his foe. Now on the toppe of lustie barbed steed, He mounted is, in glittering Armour clad, Seeking about the troupes of Aragon, For to encounter with his traiterous Neece. How he doth speed, and what doth him befall, Marke this our Act, for it doth shew it all. Exit Venus. Strike vp alarum. Enter Flaminius at one doore, Alphonsus at another, they fight, Alphonsus kill Flaminius, and say. Alphon. Go packe thou hence vnto the Stigian lake, And make report vnto thy trayterous sire, How well thou hast enioyed the Diadem, Which he by treason set vpon thy head. And if he aske thee who did send thee downe, Alphonsus say, who now must weare thy crowne. Strike vp alarum. Enter LÃ¦lius, who seeing that his King is slaine, vpbraides Alphonsus in this sort. LÃ¦li. Traytor, how darest thou looke me in the face, Whose mightie King thou trayterously hast slaine, What dost thou thinke Flaminius hath no friends, For to reuenge his death on thee againe? Yes be you sure, that ere you scape from hence, Thy gasping ghost shall beare him companie, Or else my selfe fighting for his defence, Will be content, by those thy hands to die. Alphon. LÃ¦lius, fewe words would better thee become, Especially as now the case doth stand: And diddest thou know whom thou dost threaten thus, We should you haue more calmer out of hand. For LÃ¦lius know, that I Alphonsus am, The sonne and heire to olde Carinus, whom The trayterous father of Flaminius Did secretly bereaue of his Diadem. But see the iust reuenge of mightie Ioue, The father dead, the sonne is likewise slaine, By that mans hand who they did count as dead, Yet doth suruiue to weare the Diadem, When they themselues accompany the ghosts Which wander round about the stigian fieldes. LÃ¦lius gaze vpon Alphonsus. Muse not hereat, for it is true I say, I am Alphonsus, whom thou hast misusde. [LÃ¦li.] The man whose death I did so oft lament? Kneele downe. Then pardon me for these vncurteous words The which I in my rage did vtter forth, Prickt by the dutie of a loyall mind: Pardon Alphonsus this my first offence, And let me die if ere I flight againe. Alphon. LÃ¦lius, I faine would pardon this offence, And eke accept thee to my grace againe: But that I feare that when I stand in need And want your helpe, you will your Lord betray: How say you LÃ¦lius may I trust to thee? LÃ¦li. I noble Lord, by all the Gods I vowe, For first shall heauens want stars, and foming seas Want watry drops, before Ile traytor be, Vnto Alphonsus whom I honour so. Alphon. Well then arise, and for because Ile trie If that thy words and deeds be both alike, Go haste and fetch the youthes of Aragon, Which now I heare haue turnd their heeles &amp; fled. Tell them your chance, and bring them back again Into this wood, where in ambushment lie, Vntill I come or send for you my selfe. LÃ¦li. I will my Lord. Exit LÃ¦lius. Alphon. Full litle thinks Belinus and his Peeres, What thoughts Alphonsus casteth in his mind, For if they did, they would not greatly haste To pay the same the which they promist me. Enter Belinus, Albinius, Fabius, with their souldiers, marching. Beli. Like simple sheep when shepheard absent is, Farre from his flock, assaild by greedie Wolfe, Do scattring flie about, some here, some there, To keepe their bodies from their rauening iawes, So do the fearefull youths of Aragon Run round about the greene and pleasant plaines, And hide their heads from Neapolitans: Such terror haue their strong and sturdie blowes Strooke to their hearts, as for a world of gold I warrant you they will not come againe. But noble Lords, where is the knight become Which made the blood besprinkle all the place Whereas he did encounter with his foe? My friend Albinius know you where he is? Albi. Not I my Lord, for since in thickest rankes I sawe him chase Flaminius at the heeles, I neuer yet could set mine eyes on him. Albinius spies out Alphonsus, and shewes him to Belinus. But see my Lord, whereas the warriour stands, Or else my sight doth faile me at this time. Beli. Tis he indeed, who as I do suppose, Hath slaine the King, or else some other Lord: For well I wot, a carkas I do see Hard at his feete, lie strugling on the ground. Belinus and Albinius go towards Alphonsus. Come on Albinius, we will trie the truth. Belinus say to Alphonsus. Haile to the noble victor of our foes. Alph. Thanks mightie Prince, but yet I seek not this, It is not words must recompence my paine, But deeds, when first I tooke vp Armes for you, Your promise was, what ere my sword did winne In fight, as his, Alphonsus should it craue. Shewe Belinus Flaminius, who lyeth all this while dead at his feete. See then where lies thy foe Flaminius, Whose Crowne my sword hath conquered in the field: Therefore Belinus make no long delay, But that discharge, you promist for to pay. Beli. Wil nothing else satisfie thy conquering mind Besides the Crowne? well since thou hast it wonne, Thou shalt it haue, though farre against my will. Alphonsus sit in the Chaire, Belinus takes the Crowne off of Flaminius head, and puts it on Alphonsus. Here doth Belinus Crowne thee with his hand, The King of Aragon, what are you pleasde? Sound Trumpets and Drummes within. Alphon. Not so Belinus, till you promise me All things belonging to the royall Crowne Of Aragon, and make your Lordings sweare For to defend me to their vtmost power, Against all men that shall gainsay the same. Beli. Marke what belonged erst vnto the Crowne Of Aragon, that challenge as thine owne, Belinus giues it franckly vnto thee: And sweare by all the powers of glittering skies, To do my best for to maintaine the same: So that it be not preiudiciall Vnto mine honour, or my Countrey soyle. Albi. And by the sacred seate of mightie Ioue, Albinius sweares, that first heele die the death, Before heele see Alphonsus suffer wrong. Fabi. What erst Albinius vowd we ioyntly vow. Alphon. Thanks mightie Lords, but yet I greatly feare, That very fewe will keepe the oathes they sweare. But what Belinus, why stand you so long, And cease from offering homage vnto me? What know you not that I thy soueraigne am, Crowned by thee and all thy other Lords, And now confirmed by your solemne oathes? Feed not thy selfe with fond perswasions, But presently come yeeld thy Crowne to me, And do me homage, or by heauens I sweare, Ile force thee do it maugre all thy traine. Beli. How now base brat, what are thy wits thine owne, That thou darest thus abraide me in my land? Tis best for thee these speeches to recall, Or else by Ioue ile make thee to repent That ere thou settest thy foote in Naples soyle. Alph. Base brat sayest thou, as good a man as thou. But say I came but of a base desent, My deeds shall make my glory for to shine, As cleare as Luna in a winters night. But for because thou braggest so of thy birth, Ile see how it shall profit thee anon. Fabi. Alphonsus cease from these thy threatning words, And lay aside this thy presumptuous mind, Or else be sure, thou shalt the same repent. Alphon. How now sir boy wil you be pratling too? Tis best for thee to hold thy tatling tongue, Vnlesse I send some one to scourge thy breech: Why then I see, tis time to looke about, When euery boy Alphonsus dares controll: But be they sure, ere PhÅbus golden beames Haue compassed the circle of the skie, Ile clog their toongs, since nothing else will serue To keep those vilde and threatning speeches in. Farwell Belinus, loke thou to thy selfe: Alphonsus meanes to haue thy Crowne ere night. Exit Alphonsus. Beli. What is he gone, the diuel break his necke, The fiends of hell torment his traiterous corpes: Is this the quittance of Belinus grace, Which he did shewe vnto that thankles wretch? That runnagate, that rachell, yea that theefe, For well I wot he hath robd me of a Crowne. If euer he had sprung from gentle blood, He would not thus misuse his fauourer. Albi. That runnagate, that rachel, yea that theef? Stay their sir King, your mouth runnes ouer much, It ill becomes the subiect for to vse Such trayterous termes against his soueraigne. Know thou Belinus, that Carinus sonne, Is neither rachel nor runnagate, But be thou sure, that ere the darksome night Do driue God PhÃ¦bus to his Thetis lap, Both thou and all the rest of this thy traine, Shall well repent the words which you haue saine. Beli. What traiterous villain dost thou threaten me? Lay hold on him, and see he do not scape, Ile teach the slaue to know to whom he speakes. To thee I speake, and to thy fellowes all: And though as now you haue me in your power, Yet doubt I not but that in litle space, These eyes shall see thy treason recompenst: And then I meane to vaunt of our victorie. Beli. Nay proud Albinius, neuer build on that, For though the Gods do chance for to appoynt Alphonsus victor of Belinus land, Yet shalt thou neuer liue to see that day, And therefore Fabius stand not lingring, But presently slash off his trayterous head. Albi. Slash off his head, as though Albinius head Were then so easie to be slashed off. In faith sir no, when you are gone and dead, I hope to flourish like the pleasant spring. Beli. Why how now Fabius, what do you stand in doubt, To do the deed? what feare you? who dares seeke For to reuenge his death on thee againe, Since that Belinus did commaund it so? Or are you waxt so daintie, that you dare Not vse your sword for staining of your hands? If it be so, then let me see thy sword, And I will be his butcher for this time. Fabius giue Belinus thy sword drawne, Belinus say as followeth. Now sir Albinius, are you of the minde That erst you were? what do you looke to see And triumph in Belinus ouerthrow? I hope the very sight of this my blade, Hath chaungde your minde into an other tune. Albi. Not so Belinus, I am constant still, My minde is like to the Abeston stone. Which if it once be heat in flames of fire, Deineth to becommen colde againe. Euen so am I, and shall be till I die, And though I should see Attropos appeare. With knife in hand, so slit my threed in twaine, Yet nere Albinius should perswaded be, But that Belinus he should vanquisht see. Beli. Nay then Albinius, since that words are vaine For to perswade you from this heresie: This sword shall sure put you out of doubt. Belinus offers to strike off Albinius head strike vp alarum, euer Alphonsus and his men, flie Belinus and Fabius, follow Alphonsus, and Albinius. Enter LÃ¦lius, Milos, and his seruants. LÃ¦li. My noble Lords of Aragon, I know You wonder much what might the occasion be, That LÃ¦lius which earst did flie the field, Doth egge you forwards now vnto the warres, But when you heare my reason, out of doubt Yowle be content with this my rash attempt. When first our King, Flaminius I do meane, Did set vpon the Neapolitans, The worst of you did know and plainly see, How farre they were vnable to withstand The mightie forces of our royall Campe, Vntill such time as froward fates we thought, Although the fates ordaind it for our gaine, Did send a straunger stout, whose sturdie blowes And force alone, did cause our ouerthrow. But to our purpose, this same martiall knight Did hap to hit vpon Flaminius, And lent our King then such a friendly blow, As that his gasping ghost to Lymbo went: Which when I sawe, and seeking to reuenge, My noble Lords, did hap on such a prize: As neuer King nor Keisar got the like. Mi. LÃ¦lius, of force we must confesse to thee, We wondred all, when as you did perswade Vs to returne vnto the warres againe, But since our maruell is increased much By these your words, which sound of happinesse. Therefore good LÃ¦lius make no tarrying, But soone vnfolde thy happie chaunce to vs. LÃ¦. Then friends and fellow souldiers, hark to me. When LÃ¦lius thought for to reuenge his king, On that same knight, in steed of mortall foe, I found him for to be our cheefest friend. Mi. Our cheefest friend, I hardly can beleeue, That he which made such bloudie massacres Of stout Italians, can in any poynt Beare friendship to the countrey or the King. LÃ¦. As for your king Miles, I hold with you, He beare no friendship to Flaminius, But hated him as bloudie Attropos, But for your countrey, LÃ¦lius doth auowe, He loues as well as any other land: Yea sure he loues it best of all the world: And for because, you shall not thinke that I Do say the same without a reason why, Know that the knight Alphonsus hath to name, Both sonne and heire to olde Carinus, whom Flaminius sire bereaued of his Crowne: Who did not seeke the ruine of our host, For any enuie he did beare to vs, But to reuenge him on his mortall foe, Which by the helpe of high celestiall Ioue, He hath atchieu'd with honour in the field. Mi. Alphonsus man, ile nere perswaded be, That ere Alphonsus may suruiue againe, Who with Carinus many yeares agoe, Was said to wander in the stigian fieldes. LÃ¦li. Truth Noble Miles, these mine eares haue heard, For certaintie reported vnto me, That olde Carinus with his peerlesse sonne, Had felt the sharpnesse of the sisters sheeres, And had I not of late Alphonsus seene In good estate, though all the world should say He is aliue, I would not credit them: But fellow souldiers wend you backe with me, And let vs lurke within the secret shade, Which he himselfe appointed vnto vs: And if you find my words to be vntroth, Then let me die to recompence the wrong. Strike vp alarum, Enter Albinius with his sword drawne, and say. Albi. LÃ¦lius make haste, souldiers of Aragon, Set lingring by, and come and helpe your King. I meane Alphonsus, who whilest that he did Pursue Belinus at the very heeles, Was suddenly enuironed about, With all the troupes of mightie Millain land. Mi. What newes is this, and is it very so? Is our Alphonsus yet in humane state, Whom all the world did iudge for to be dead. Yet can I scarce giue credit to the same. Giue credit, yes, and since the Millain Duke, Hath broke his league of friendship, be he sure, Ere Cynthia, the shining lampe of night, Doth scale the heauens with her horned head, Both he and his shall very plainly see, The league is burst, that caused long the glee. LÃ¦. And could the traytor harbor in his brest Such mortall treason gainst his soueraigne, As when he should with fire and sword defend Him from his foes, he seekes his ouerthrow? March on my friends, I nere shall ioy at all, Vntill I see that bloudie traytors fall. Exeunt. Strike vp alarum, flie Belinus, follow LÃ¦lius: flie Fabius, follow Albinius: flie the Duke of Millaine, follow Miles.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Strike vp alarum, Enter Venus. No sooner did Alphonsus with his troupe, Set on the souldiers of Belinus band, But that the furie of his sturdie blowes, Did strike such terror to their daunted mindes, That glad was he which could escape away, With life and limme, forth of that bloudie fray. Belinus flies vnto the Turkish soyle, To craue the aide of Amuracke their King: Vnto the which he willingly did consent, And sends Belinus with two other Kings, To know god Mahomets pleasure in the same: Meane time the Empresse by Medeas helpe, Did vse such charmes, that Amuracke did see In soundest sleepe, what afterward should hap: How Amuracke did recompence her paine, With mickle more, this Act shall shew you plaine. Exit Venus. Enter one, carrying two Crownes vpon a Crest, Alphonsus, Albinius, LÃ¦lius and Miles, with their souldiers. Alph. Welcome braue youthes of Aragon to me. Yea welcome Miles, LÃ¦lius and the rest, Whose prowesse alone hath bene the onely cause, That we like victors haue subdued our foes. Lord what a pleasure was it to my minde, To see Belinus, which not long before, Did with his threatnings terrefie the Gods, Now scudde apace, from warlike LÃ¦lius blowes: The Duke of Millaine he increast our sport, When doubting that his force was ouerweake, For to withstand Miles, thy sturdie arme Did giue more credence to his frisking skippes Then to the sharpnesse of his cutting blade, What Fabius did to pleasure vs withall, Albinius knowes as well as I my selfe: For well I wot, if that thy tyred steed Had bene as fresh and swift in foote as his, He should haue felt, yea knowne for certaintie, To checke Alphonsus, did deserue to die. Breefly my friends and fellow peeres in armes, The worst of you doo deserue such mickle praise, As that my tongue denies for to set forth The demie parcell of your valiant deeds, So that perforce, I must by dutie be Bound to you all, for this your curtesie. Mi. Not so my Lord, for if our willing armes Haue pleasured you so much, as you do say, We haue done nought but that becommeth vs: For to defend our mightie soueraigne. As for my part, I count my labour small, Yea though it had bene twise as much againe, Since that Alphonsus doth accept thereof. Alphon. Thankes worthie Miles, least all the world Should count Alphonsus thanklesse for to be, LÃ¦lius sit downe, and Miles sit by him, And that receiue, the which your swords haue wonne. Sit downe LÃ¦lius and Miles. First, for because thou LÃ¦lius in these broyles, By martiall might, didst proude Belinus chase, From troupe to troupe, from side to side about, And neuer ceast from this thy swift pursute, Vntill thou hadst obtaind his royall Crowne, Therefore I say, ile do thee nought but right, And giue thee that which thou well hast wonne, Set the Crowne on his head. Here doth Alphonsus Crowne thee LÃ¦lius, King Of Naples Towne, with all dominions That earst belonged to our trayterous foe, That proud Belinus in his regiment. Sound Trumpets and Drummes. Miles, thy share the Millaine Dukedome is, For well I wot thy sword deseru'd no lesse. Set the Crowne on his head. The which Alphonsus frankly giueth thee, In presence of his warlike men at armes. And if that any stomacke this my deed, Alphonsus can reuenge thy wrong with speed. Sound Trumpets and Drummes. Now to Albinius which in all my toyles I haue both faithfull, yea and friendly found: Since that the Gods and friendly Fates assigne This present time to me to recompence, The sundry pleasures thou hast done to me, Sit downe by them, and on thy faithfull head Take the Crowne from thy owne head. Receiue the Crowne of peerlesse Aragon. Albi. Pardon deare Lord Albinius at this time, It ill becomes me for to weare a Crowne, When as my Lord is destitute himselfe: Why high Alphonsus, if I should receiue This Crowne of you, the which high Ioue forbid, Where would your selfe obtaine a Diadem? Naples is gone, Millaine possessed is, And nought is left for you but Aragon. Alphon. And nought is left for me but Aragon? Yes surely yes, my Fates haue so decreed, That Aragon should be too base a thing, For to obtaine Alphonsus for her King. What heare you not how that our scattered foes, Belinus, Fabius, and the Millaine Duke, Are fled for succour to the Turkish Court? And thinke you not that Amurack their King, Will with the mightiest power of all his land, Seeke to reuenge Belinus ouerthrow? Then doubt I not but ere these broyles do end, Alphonsus shall possesse the Diadem That Amurack now weares vpon his head. Sit downe therefore and that receiue of mee: The which the Fates appointed vnto thee. Albi. Thou king of heauen, which by thy power diuine, Dost see the secrets of each liuers heart, Beare record now with what vnwilling mind, I do receiue the Crowne of Aragon. Albinius sit downe by LÃ¦lius &amp; Miles, Alphonsus set the Crowne on his head, and say. Alphon. A rise Albinius King of Aragon, Crowned by me, who till my gasping ghost Do part asunder from my breathlesse corpes, Will be thy shield against all men aliue: That for thy kingdome any way do striue. Sound Trumpets and Drummes. Now since we haue in such an happie houre Confirmd three kings, come let vs march with speed Into the Citie, for to celebrate With mirth and ioy, this blisfull festiuall. Exeunt omnes. Enter Amurack the great Turke, Belinus, Fabius, Areastus King of Moores. Claramount, King of Barbery. Baiazet a Lord, with their traine. Amu. Welcome Belinus to thy cosens Court, Whose late arriuall in such posting pace, Doth bring both ioy and sorrow to vs all: Sorrow because the Fates haue bene so false, To let Alphonsus driue thee from thy land: And ioy, since that now mightie Mahomet Hath giuen me cause to recompence at full, The sundry pleasures I receiu'd of thee. Therefore Belinus do but aske and haue: For Amurack doth grant what ere you craue. Beli. Thou second sun which with thy glimsing beames Doest clarifie each corner of the earth, Belinus comes not, as earst Mydas did, To mightie Bacchus, to desire of him, That what so ere at any time he toucht, Might turned be to gold incontinent. Nor do I come as Iuppiter did erst Vnto the Pallace of Amphitrion, For any fond or foule concupiscence, Which I do beare to Alcumenaes hew. But as poore Saturne, forst by mightie Ioue To flie his Countrey, banisht and forlorne, Did craue the aide of Troos, King of Troy. So comes Belinus to high Amurack. And if he can but once your aide obtaine, He turnes with speed to Naples backe againe. Amu. My aide Belinus, do you doubt of that? If all the men at armes of Affrica, Of Asia likewise, will sufficient be, To presse the pompe of that vsurping mate: Assure thy selfe, thy kingdome shalbe thine, If Mahomet say I vnto the same: For were I sure to vanquish all our foes, And find such spoiles in ransacking their Tents, As neuer any Keisar did obtaine, Yet would I not set foote forth of this land: If Mahomet our iourney did withstand. Beli. Nor would Belinus for King CrÃ¦sus trash, Wish Amurack to displease the Gods, In pleasuring me in such a trifling toy. Then mightie Monarch, if it be thy will, Get their consents, and then the act fulfill. Amu. You counsel well, therefore Belinus haste, And Claramount go beare him companie, With King Arcastus, to the Citie walles. Then bend with speed vnto the darksome groue, Where Mahomet this many a hundred yeare Hath prophesied vnto our auncesters, Tell to his Priests, that Amurack your King Is now selecting all his men at armes, To set vpon that proud Alphonsus troupe. The cause you know, and can enforme him well, That makes me take these bloudie broyles in hand: And say that I desire their sacred God, That Mahomet which ruleth all the skies, To send me word and that most speedely, Which of vs shall obtaine the victory. Exeunt omnes, preter Baiazet and Amurack. You Baiazet go poste away apace, To Siria, Scythia, and Albania, To Babylon, with Mesopotamia, Asia, Armenia, and all other lands Which owe their homage to high Amurack. Charge all their Kings with expedition To gather vp the cheefest men at armes Which now remaine in their dominions, And on the twentie day of the same month, To come and wait on Amurack their King, At his chiefe Citie Constantinople. Tell them moreouer, that who so doth faile, Nought else but death, from prison shall him baile. Exit Baiazet. Assoone as he is gone, sound musicke within. What heauenly Musicke soundeth in my eare? Peace Amurack and hearken to the same. Sound musicke, hearken Amurack, and fall a sleepe. Enter Medea, Fausta the Empresse, Iphigina her daughter. Medea. Now haue our charmes fulfild our minds full well, High Amurack is lulled fast asleepe, And doubt I not, but ere he wakes againe, You shall perceiue Medea did not gibe, When as she put this practise in your mind: Sit worthie Fausta at thy spowse his feete. Fausta and Iphigina, sit downe at Amuracks feete. Iphigina, sit thou on the other side: What ere you see be not agast thereat, But beare in mind what Amurack doth chat. Medea do ceremonies belonging to coniuring, and say. Thou which wert wont in Agamemnons dayes To vtter forth Apolloes Oracles At sacred Delphos, Calchas I do meane, I charge thee come, all lingring set aside, Vnles the pennance you thereof abide. I coniure thee by Plutoes loathsome lake, By all the hags which harbour in the same, By stinking Stix, and filthie Plegeton, To come with speed, and truly to fulfill That which Medea to thee streight shall will. Rise Calchas vp in a white Cirples and a Cardinals Myter, and say. Cal. Thou wretched witch, when wilt thou make an end Of troubling vs with these thy cursed Charmes? What meanst thou thus to call me from my graue? Shall nere my ghost obtaine his quiet rest? Me. Yes Calchas yes, your rest doth now approch Medea meanes to trouble thee no more, When as thou hast fulfild her mind this once. Go get thee hence to Pluto backe againe, And there enquire of the Destinies, How Amurack shall speed in these his warres: Peruse their bookes, and marke what is decreed By Ioue himselfe, and all his fellow Gods: And when thou knowst the certaintie thereof, By fleshlesse visions shewe it presently To Amuracke, in paine of penaltie. Cal. Forst by thy charme though with vnwilling minde: I hast to hell, the certaintie to finde. Calchas sinke downe where you came vp. Me. Now peerles Princes I must needs be gon, My hastie businesse calls me from this place. There resteth nought, but that you beare in minde, What Amuracke in this his fit doth say. For marke what dreaming madam he doth prate: Assure your selfe, that that shalbe his fate. Fau. Though very loth to let thee so depart, Farewell Medea, easer of my hart. Exit Medea. Sound Instruments within, Amurack as it were in a dreame, say. Amu. What Amurack doest thou begin to nod? Is this the care that thou hast of thy warres? As when thou shouldst be prancing of thy steed, To egge thy souldiers forward in thy warres: Thou sittest moping by the fire side? See where thy Viceroies grouell on the ground. Looke where Belinus breatheth forth his ghost. Behold by millions how thy men do fall Before Alphonsus like to sillie sheepe. And canst thou stand still lazing in this sort? No proud Alphonsus, Amurack doth flie To quaile thy courage, and that speedilie. Sound Instruments a while within, and then Amuracke say. And doest thou think thou proud iniurious God, Mahound I meane, since thy vaine prophesies Led Amurack into this dolefull case, To haue his Princely feete in irons clapt, Which erst the proudest kings were forst to kisse, That thou shalt scape vnpunisht for the same? No no, assoone as by the helpe of Ioue, I scape this bondage, downe go all thy groues. Thy alters tumble round about the streets. And whereas erst we sacrifisde to thee: Now all the Turks thy mortall foes shall bee. Sound Instruments a while within, Amuracke say. Behold the Iemme and Iewel of mine age, See where she comes, whose heauenly maiestie Doth far surpasse the braue and gorgeous pace Which Cytherea daughter vnto Ioue, Did put in vre when as she had obtaind. The golden Apple at the shepheards hands. See worthie Fausta where Alphonsus stands, Whose valiant courage could not daunted be, With all the men at armes of Affrica: See now he stands, as one that lately sawe Medusaes head, or Gorgons hoarie hue. Sound Instruments a while within, Amurack say: And can it be that it may happen so? Can Fortune proue so friendly vnto me, As that Alphonsus loues Iphigina? The match is made, the wedding is decreed. Sound trumpets haw, strike drums for mirth &amp; glee: And three times welcome sonne in lawe to mee. Fausta rise vp as it were in a furie, wake Amuracke and say. Fau. Fie Amurack, what wicked words be these? How canst thou looke thy Fausta in her face, Whom thou hast wronged in this shamefull sort? And are the vowes so solemnely you sware Vnto Belinus my most friendly neece, Now washt so clearly from thy traiterous heart? Is all the rancor which you earst did beare Vnto Alphonsus, worne so out of mind, As where thou shouldest pursue him to death, You seeke to giue our daughter to his hands? The Gods forbid that such a hainous deed, With my consent should euer be decreed. And rather then thou shouldst it bring to passe, If all the armie of Amazones Will be sufficient to withhold the same, Assure thy selfe that Fausta meanes to fight Against Amuracke, for to maintaine the right. Iphi. Yea mother, say, which Mahomet forbid, That in this conflict you should haue the foyle, Ere that Alphonsus should be cald my spowse, This heart, this hand, yea and this blade should be, A readier meanes to finish that decree. Amuracke rise in a rage from thy chaire. Amu. What threatning words thus thunder in mine eares? Or who are they amongst the mortall troupes, That dares presume to vse such threats to me? The prowdest Kings and Keisers of the land Are glad to feed me in my fantasie: And shall I suffer then, each pratling dame For to vpbraide me in this spightfull sort? No by the heauens, first will I loose my Crowne, My wife, my children, yea my life and all: And therefore Fausta, thou which Amuracke Didst tender erst, as the apple of mine eye, Auoyd my Court, and if thou lou'st thy life, Approach not nigh vnto my regiment. As for this carping gyrle Iphigina, Take her with thee to beare thee company, And in my land, I reed be seene no more, For if you do, you both shall die therefore. Exit Amurack. Fau. Nay then I see, tis time to looke about, Delay is dangerous, and procureth harme, The wanton colt is tamed in his youth, Wounds must be cured when they be fresh and greene: And plurisies when they begin to breed, With little ease are driuen away with speed. Had Fausta then when Amuracke begunne, With spightfull speeches to controll and checke, Sought to preuent it by her martiall force, This banishment had neuer hapt to me, But the Echinus fearing to be goard, Doth keepe her younglings in her paunch so long, Till when their prickes be waxen long and sharpe, They put their damme at length to double paine: And I because I loathed the broyles of Mars, Bridled my thoughts, and pressed downe my rage, In recompence of which my good intent, I haue receiu'd this wofull banishment. Wofull said I? nay happie I did meane, If that be happie, which doth set one free: For by this meanes, I do not doubt ere long, But Fausta shall with ease, reuenge her wrong. Come daughter come, my minde foretelleth me: That Amuracke shall soone requited be. Make as though you were a going out, Medea meete her and say. Me. Fausta, what meanes this sudden flight of yours? Why do you leaue your husbands princely Court, And all alone passe through these thickest groues, More fit to harbour brutish sauadge beasts, Then to receiue so high a Queene as you? Although your credit would not stay your steps, From bending them into these darkish dennes, Yet should the daunger which is imminent, To euery one which passeth by these pathes, Keepe you at home with fayre Iphigina. What foolish toy hath tickled you to this? I greatly feare some hap hath hit amis. Fau. No toy Medea, tickled Faustaes head, Nor foolish fancie ledde me to these groues, But earnest businesse egges my trembling steps, To passe all dangers what so ere they be. I banisht am Medea, I which erst Was Empresse ouer all the triple world, Am banisht now from pallace and from pompe, But if the gods be fauourers to me, Ere twentie dayes, I will reuenged be. Me. I thought as much, when first from thickest leaues, I saw you trudging in such posting pace. But to the purpose, what may be the cause, Of this strnnge and sudden banishment? Fau. The cause aske you, a simple cause god wot: Twas neither treason, nor yet felonie, But for because I blamde his foolishnes. Me. I heare you say so, but I greatly feare, Ere that your tale be brought vnto an end, Youle proue your selfe the author of the same: But pray be briefe, what follie did your spowse? And how will you reuenge your wrong on him? Fau. What follie quoth you? such as neuer yet Was heard or seene, since PhÅbus first gan shine, You know how he was gathering in all haste, His men at armes, to set vpon the troupe Of proude Alphonsus, yea you well do know, How you and I did do the best we could, To make him shew vs in his drowsie dreame, What afterward should happen in his warres: Much talke he had, which now I haue forgot. But at the length, this surely was decreed, How that Alphonsus and Iphigina Should be conioynd in Iunoes sacred rites, Which when I heard, as one that did despise, That such a traytor should be sonne to me, I did rebuke my husband Amuracke. And since my words could take no better place, My sword with helpe of all Amazones, Shall make him soone repent his foolishnes. Me. This is the cause then of your banishment, And now you goe vnto Amazone, To gather all your maydens in array, To set vpon the mightie Amuracke? Oh foolish Queene, what meant you by this talke? Those pratling speeches haue vndone you all. Do you disdaine to haue that mightie Prince, I meane Alphonsus, counted for your sonne? I tell you Fausta, he is borne to be, The ruler of a mightie Monarchie: I must confesse the powers of Amuracke Be great, his confines stretch both far and neare, Yet are they not the third part of the lands, Which shall be ruled by Alphonsus hands, And yet you daine to call him sonne in law: But when you see his sharpe and cutting sword Piercing the heart of this your gallant gyrle, Youle curse the houre wherein you did denay, To ioyne Alphonsus with Iphigina. Fau. The gods forbid, that ere it happen so. Me. Nay neuer pray, for it must happen so. Fau. And is there then no remedie for it? Me. No none but one, &amp; that you haue forsworn, Fau. As though an oath can bridle so my minde, As that I dare not breake a thousand oathes, For to eschew the danger imminent. Speake good Medea, tell that way to me, And I will do it, what so ere it be. Me. Then as already you haue well decreed, Packe to your countrey, and in readinesse, Select the armie of Amazones, When you haue done, march with your female troupe To Naples Towne, to succour Amuracke, And so by marriage of Iphigina, You soone shall driue the danger cleane away. Iphigi. So shall we soone eschew Caribdis lake, And headlong fall to Syllaes greedie gulph, I vowd before, and now do vow againe: Before I wedde Alphonsus, Ile be slaine. Me. In vaine it is, to striue against the streame, Fates must be followed, and the gods decree Must needs take place in euery kinde of cause. Therfore faire maide, bridle these brutish thoughts, And learne to follow what the fates assigne, When Saturne heard, that Iuppiter his sonne Should driue him headlong from his heauenly seat, Downe to the bottome of the darke Auarne, He did command his mother presently, To do to death, the young and guiltlesse childe: But what of that, the mother loathd in heart, For to commit so vile a massacre. Yea Ioue did liue, and as the fates did say, From heauenly seate, draue Saturne cleane away. What did auaile the Castle all of Steele, The which Acrisius caused to be made, To keepe his daughter Danae clogged in? She was with childe for all her Castles force, And by that child, Acrisius her sire, Was after slaine, so did the fates require. A thousand examples, I could bring hereof. But Marble stones needs no colouring, And that which euery one doth know for truth, Needs no examples to confirme the same. That which the fates appoint must happen so, Though heauenly Ioue, and all the Gods say no. Fau. Iphigina, she sayth nought but truth, Fates must be followed in their iust decrees: And therefore setting all delayes aside, Come let vs wend vnto Amazone, And gather vp our forces out of hand. Iphi. Since Fausta wils, and fates do so command, Iphigina will neuer it withstand. Exeunt omnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. Enter Venus. Thus haue you seene, how Amuracke himselfe, Fausta his wife, and euery other King, Which holds their scepters at the Turke his hands, Are now in armes, entending to destroy And bring to nought, the Prince of Aragon. Charmes haue bene vsde by wise Medeas art, To know before what afterward shall hap, And King Belinus with high Claramount, Ioynd to Alphonsus, which with Princely pompe, Doth rule and gouerne all the warlike Moores, Are sent as Legats to god Mahomet, To know his counsell in these high affaires. Mahound prouokte by Amurackes discourse, Which as you heard, he in his dreame did vse, Denies to play the Prophet any more, But by the long intreatie of his Priests, He prophesies in such a craftie sort, As that the hearers needs must laugh for sport. Yet poore Belinus with his fellow Kings, Did giue such credence to that forged tale, As that they lost their dearest liues thereby, And Amuracke became a prisoner Vnto Alphonsus, as straight shall appeare. Exit Venus. Let there be a brazen Head set in the middle of the place behind the Stage, out of the which, cast flames of fire, drums rumble within, Enter two Priests. 1. Pr. My fellow Priests of Mahounds holy house, What can you iudge of these strange miracles, Which daily happen in this sacred seate? Drums rumble within. Harke what a rumbling ratleth in our eares. Cast flames of fire forth of the brazen Head. See flakes of fire proceeding from the mouth Of Mahomet, that God of peereles power. Nor can I tell with all the wit I haue, What Mahomet by these his signes doth craue. 2. Pr. Thrise ten times PhÅbus with his golden beames, Hath compassed the circle of the skie, Thrise ten times Ceres, hath her workemen hir'd, And fild her barnes with frutefull crops of corne, Since first in Priesthood I did lead my life: Yet in this time I neuer heard before, Such feareful sounds, nor saw such wondrous sights, Nor can I tell, with all the wit I haue, What Mahomet by these his signes doth craue. Speake out of the brazen Head. Ma. You cannot tell, nor will you seeke to know, Oh peruerse Priest, how carelesse are you waxt? As when my foes approach vnto my gates, You stand still talking of I cannot tell: Go packe you hence, and meete the Turkish kings, Which now are drawing to my Temple ward: Tell them from me, God Mahomet is dispos'd To prophesie no more to Amuracke, Since that his tongue is waxen now so free, As that it needs must chat and raile at me. Kneele downe both. 1. Pr. Oh Mahomet, if all the solemne prayers Which from our childhood we haue offered thee, Can make thee call this sentence backe againe, Bring not thy Priest into this dangerous state: For when the Turke doth heare of this repulse, We shall be sure to die the death therefore. Ma. Thou sayest truth, go call the Princes in, Ile prophesie vnto them for this once, But in such wise, as they shall neither boast, Nor you be hurt in any kinde of wise. Enter Belinus, Claramont, Arcastus, go both the Priests to meet him: the first say. 1. Pr. You Kings of Turkie, Mahomet our God, By sacred science, hauing notice that You were sent Legats from high Amuracke, Vnto this place, commaunded vs his Priests, That we should cause you make as mickle speed, As well you might, to heare for certaintie, Of that shall happen to your King and ye. Beli. For that intent we came into this place, And sithens that, the mightie Mahomet Is now at leisure for to tell the same, Let vs make haste and take time while we may: For mickle daunger hapneth through delay. 2. Pri. Truth worthy king, and therfore you yourselfe, With your companions, kneele before this place, And listen well what Mahomet doth say. Kneele all downe before the brasen Head. Beli. As you do will, we ioyntly will obey. Ma. Princes of Turkie, and Embassadors Of Amuracke, to mightie Mahomet, I needs must muse, that you which erst haue bene The readiest souldiers of the triple world, Are now become so slacke in your affaires, As when you should with bloudie blade in hand, Be hacking helmes in thickest of your foes, You stand still loytering in the Turkish soyle. What know you not, how that it is decreed, By all the gods, and chiefly by my selfe: That you with triumph should all Crowned bee: Make haste Kings, least when the fates do see, How carlesly you do neglect their words, They call a Counsell, and force Mahomet Against his will some other thing to set. Send Fabius backe to Amuracke againe, To haste him forwards in his enterprise: And march you on with all the troupes you haue, To Naples ward, to conquer Aragon. For if you stay, both you and all your men, Must needs be sent downe straight to Lymbo den. 2. Pri. Muse not braue kings at Mahomets discourse, For marke what he forth of that mouth doth say, Assure your selfe it needs must happen so. Therfore make hast, go mount you on your steeds, And set vpon Alphonsus presently. So shall you reape great honor for your paine: And scape the scourge, which els the Fates ordaine. Rise all vp. Beli. Then proud Alphonsus, looke thou to thy Crowne, Belinus comes in glittring armor clad, All readie prest for to reuenge the wrong Which not long since, you offred vnto him. And since we haue God Mahound on our side: The victorie must needs to vs betide. Cla. Worthie Belinus, set such threats away, And let vs haste as fast as horse can trot, To set vpon presumptuous Aragon. You Fabius, hast as Mahound did commaund, To Amuracke, with all the speed you may. Fabi. With willing mind I hasten on my way. Exit Fabius. Beli. And thinking long till that we be in fight, Belinus hastes to quaile Alphonsus might. Exeunt omnes. Strike vp alarum a while. Enter Carinus. Cari. No sooner had God PhÃ¦bus brightsome beames Begun to diue within the Westerne seas, And darksome Nox had spred about the earth Her blackish mantle, but a drowsie sleepe Did take possession of Carinus sence, And Morphei shewd me strange disguised shapes. Me thought I saw Alphonsus my deare sonne, Plast in a throane all glittering cleare with gold, Bedeckt with diamonds, pearles &amp; precious stones, Which shind so cleare, and glittered all so bright, Hiperions couch, that well be termd it might. Aboue his head a canapie was set, Not deckt with plumes as other Princes vse, But all beset with heads of conquered kings: Enstald with Crowns, which made a gallant shew, And strooke a terror to the viewers harts. Vnder his feete lay grouelling on the ground, Thousand of Princes, which he in his warres By martiall might did conquer and bring lowe. Some lay as dead as either stock or stone, Some other tumbled wounded to the death: But most of them as to their soueraigne king, Did offer duly homage vnto him. As thus I stood beholding of this pompe, Me thought Alphonsus did espie me out: And at a trice he leauing throane alone, Came to imbrace me in his blessed armes. Then noyse of drums, and sound of trumpets shrill, Did wake Carinus from this pleasant dreame. Something I know is now foreshewne by this: The Gods forsend that ought should hap amis. Carinus walke vp and downe. Enter the Duke of Millain in Pilgrims apparell, and say. Du. This is the chance of fickle Fortunes wheele A Prince at morne, a Pilgrim ere it be night: I which erewhile did daine for to possesse, The proudest pallace of the westerne world, Would now be glad, a cottage for to finde, To hide my head, so Fortune hath assignde. Thrise Hesperus with pompe and peerelesse pride Hath heau'd his head forth of the Easterne seas: Thrise Cynthia, with PhÅbus borrowed beames, Hath shew? her bewtie throgh the darkish clowdes, Since that I wretched Dulce haue tasted ought, Or drunke a drop of any kinde of drinke. Instead of beds set forth with Ibonie, The greenish grasse hath bene my resting place, And for my pillow stuffed with downe, The hardish hillockes haue sufficed my turne. Thus I which erst had all things at my will, A life more hard then death do follow still. Ca. Me thinks I heare, not very far from hence, Some wofull wight, lamenting his mischance: Ile go and see, if that I can espie Him where he sits, or ouerheare his talke. Du. Oh Millaine, Millaine, litle dost thou thinke, How that thy Duke is now in such distresse, For if thou didst, I soone should be releast Forth of this greedie gulph of miserie. Ca. The Millaine Duke, I thought as much before, When first I glaunst mine eyes vpon his face: This is the man which was the onely cause, That I was forst to flie from Aragon. High Ioue be prais'd, which hath allotted me So fit a time to quite that iniurie. Pilgrime God speed. Du. Welcome graue sir to me. Cari. Me thought as now I heard you for to speak Of Millaine land, pray do you know the same? I aged father, I haue cause to know, Both Millaine land, and all the parts thereof. Cari. Why then I doubt not but you can resolue Me of a question that I shall demaund. Duke. I that I can, what euer that it be. Cari. Then to be briefe, not twentie winters past When these my lims which withered are with age, Were in the prime and spring of all their youth, I still desirous as yoong gallants be, To see the fashions of Arabia, My nature soyle, and in this pilgrims weed, Began to trauell through vnkenned lands, Much ground I past, and many soyles I saw, But when my feete in Millain land I set, Such sumptuous triumphs daily there I saw, As neuer in my life I found the like. I pray good sir, what might the occasion bee: That made the Millains make such mirth and glee? Duk. This solemne ioy wherof you now do speak, Was not solemnized my friend in vaine. For at that time there came into the land, The happiest tidings that they ere did heare. For newes was brought vpon that solemne day, Vnto our Court, that Ferdinandus proud Was slaine himselfe, Carinus and his sonne Were banisht both for euer from Aragon: And for these happie newes that ioy was made. Cari. But what I pray did afterward become, Of old Carinus with his banisht sonne? What heare you nothing of them all this while? Du. Yes too too much, the Millain Duke may say. Alphonsus first by secret meanes did get To be a souldier in Belinus warres: Wherein he did behaue himselfe so well, As that he got the Crowne of Aragon. Which being got, he dispossest also, The King Belinus which had fostered him: As for Carinus he is dead and gone, I would his sonne were his companion. Cari. A blister build vpon that traytors tongue, But for thy friendship which thou shewedst me, Take that of me, I frankly giue it thee. Stab him. Now will I haste to Naples with all speed, To see if Fortune will so fauour me, To view Alphonsus in his happie state. Exit Carinus. Enter Amuracke, Crocon King of Arabia, Faustus, King of Babilon, Fabius, with the Turkes Ganesaries. Amu. Fabius come hither, what is that thou sayest? What did god Mahound prophecie to vs? Why do our Viceroyes wend vnto the warres, Before their king had notice of the same? What do they thinke to play bob foole with me? Or are they waxt so frolicke now of late, Since that they had the leading of our bands, As that they thinke that mightie Amuracke Dares do no other then to soothe them vp? Why speakest thou not? what fond or franticke fit Did make those care lesse Kings to venture it? Fa. Pardon deare Lord, no franticke fit at all, No frolicke vaine, nor no presumptuous mind, Did make your Viceroies take these wars in hand. But forst they were by Mahounds prophecie, To do the same, or else resolue to die. Amu. So sir, I heare you, but can scare beleeue That Mahomet would charge them go before Against Alphonsus with so small a troupe, Whose number farre exceeds king Xerxes troupe, Fa. Yes Noble Lord, and more then that hee said, That ere that you with these your warlike men, Should come to bring your succour to the field: Belinus, Claramount, and Arcastus too, Should al be crownd with crownes of beaten gold, And borne with triumphes round about their t?ts. Amu. With triumph man, did Mahound tell them so? Prouost go carrie Fabius presently, Vnto the Marshalsie, there let him rest, Clapt sure and safe in fetters all of steele, Till Amuracke discharge him from the same. For be he sure, vnles it happen so As he did say, Mahound did prophesie, By this my hand, forthwith the slaue shall die. Lay hold of Fabius, and make as though you carrie him out, Enter a souldier and say. Mess. Stay Prouost stay, let Fabius alone, More fitteth now, that euery lustie lad Be buckling on his helmet, then to stand In carrying souldiers to the Marshalsie. Amu. Why what art thou, That darest once presume, For to gainsay that Amuracke did bid? Messen. I am my Lord, The wretcheds man aliue: Borne vnderneath the Planet of mishap: Erewhile, a souldier of Belinus band But now. Amu. What now? Mess. The mirror of mishap: Whose Captaine is slaine, and all his armie dead: Onely excepted me vnhappie wretch. Amu. What newes is this, and is Belinus slaine? Is this the Crowne which Mahomet did say, He should with triumph weare vpon his head? Is this the honour which that cursed god Did prophesie, should hapen to them all? Oh DÃ¦dalus, and wert thou now aliue, To fasten wings vpon high Amuracke, Mahound should know, and that for certaintie, That turkish Kings can brooke no iniurie. Fabi. Tush tush my Lord, I wonder what you meane, Thus to exclaime against high Mahomet: Ile lay my life, that ere this day be past, You shall perceiue, his tidings all be waste. Amu. We shall perceiue, accursed Fabius, Suffice it not that thou hast bene the man, That first didst beate those bables in my braine, But that to helpe me forward in my greefe, Thou seekest to confirme so fowle a lie. Stab him. Go get thee hence, and tell thy trayterous King What gift you had, which did such tidings bring. And now my Lords, since nothing else will serue, Buckle your helmes, clap on your steeled coates, Mount on your steeds, take Launces in your hands, For Amuracke doth meane this very day, Proude Mahomet with weapons to assay. Messen. Mercie high Monarch, tis no time now To spend the day in such vaine threatnings, Against our god, the mightie Mahomet: More fitteth thee to place thy men at armes In battle ray, for to withstand your foes, Which now are drawing towards you with speed. Sound drummes within. Hark how their drummes with dub a dub do come, To armes high Lord, and set these trifles by: That you may set vpon them valiantly. Amu. And do they come you kings of Turkie? Now is the time, in which your warlike armes Must raise your names aboue the starrie skies: Call to your minde your predecessors acts, Whose martiall might, this many a hundred yeare, Did keepe those fearefull dogs in dread and awe, And let your weapons shew Alphonsus plaine, That though that they be clapped vp in clay, Yet there be branches sprung vp from those trees, In Turkish land, which brooke no iniuries. Besides the same, remember with your selues, What foes we haue, not mightie Tamberlaine, Nor souldiers trained vp amongst the warres, But fearefull bodies, pickt from their rurall flocke, Which till this time were wholy ignorant What weapons ment, or bloudie Mars doth craue. More would I say, but horses that be free, Do need no spurs: and souldiers which themselues Long and desire to buckle with the foe, Do need no words to egge them to the same. Enter Alphonsus, with a Canapie carried ouer him by three Lords, hauing ouer each corner a Kings head, crowned with him, Albinius, LÃ¦lius, Miles, with Crownes on their heads, and their souldiers. Besides the same, behold whereas our foes Are marching towards vs most speedilie. Courage my Lords, ours is the victorie. Alph. Thou Pagan dog how darst thou be so bold To set thy foote within Alphonsus land? What art thou come to view thy wretched kings, Whose traiterous heads bedeckt my tents so well? Or else thou hearing that on top thereof, There is a place left vacant, art thou come To haue thy head possesse the highest seate? If it be so, lie downe, and this my sword Shall presently that honor thee affoord. If not, pack hence, or by the heauens I vow, Both thou and thine shall verie soone perceiue, That he that seekes to moue my patience, Must yeeld his life to thee for recompence. Amu. Why proud Alphonsus, thinkst thou Amurack Whose mightie force doth terrefie the Gods, Can ere be found to turne his heeles and flie Away for feare, from such a boy as thou? No no, although that Mars this mickle while Hath fortified thy weake and feeble arme, And Fortune oft hath viewd with friendly face, Thy armies marching victors from the field, Yet at the presence of high Amuracke, Fortune shall change, and Mars that God of might Shall succour me, and leaue Alphonsus quight. Alphon. Pagan I say, thou greatly art deceiu'd, I clap vp Fortune in a cage of gold, To make her turne her wheele as I thinke best. And as for Mars whom you do say will change, He moping sits behind the kitchin doore, Prest at commaund of euery Skulhans mouth: Who dares not stir, nor once to moue a whit For feare Alphonsus then should stomack it. Amu. Blasphemous dog, I wonder that the earth Doth cease from renting vnderneath thy feete, To swallow vp those cankred corpes of thine. I muse that Ioue can bridle so his ire, As when he heares his brother so misusde, He can refraine from sending thunderbolts By thick and threefold to reuenge his wrong. Mars fight for me, and Fortune be my guide: And ile be victor what some ere betide. Albi. Pray loud enough, lest that you pray in vain, Perhaps God Mars and Fortune is a sleepe, And Mars lies slumbring on his downie bed: Yet do not think but that the power we haue, Without the helpe of those celestiall Gods, Will be sufficient, yea with small ado, Alphonsus stragling armie to subdue. LÃ¦. You had need as then to call Mahomet, With hellish hags to performe the same. Fau. High Amurack I wonder what you meane That when you may with litle toyle or none, Compell these dogs to keepe their toongs in peace: You let them stand still barking in this sort: Beleeue me soueraigne, I do blush to see These beggers brats to chat so frolikelie. Alphon. How now sir boy, let Amurack himselfe Or any he, the proudest of you all, But offer once for to vnsheath his sword If that he dares, for all the power you haue. Amu. What darst thou vs? my selfe wil venter it. To armes my mates. Amuracke draw thy sword. Alphonsus and all the other kings draw theirs, strike vp alarum, flie Amuracke and his companie. Follow Alphonsus and his companie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. Srike vp Alarum. Enter Venus. Fearce is the fight, and bloudie is the broyle, No sooner had the roaring cannon shot Spit forth the venome of their fiered panch, And with their pellets sent such troupes of soules Downe to the bottome of the darke Auerne, As that it couered all the stigian fields. But on a sudden, all the men at armes Which mounted were on lustie coursers backes, Did rush togither with so great a noyse, As that I thought the giants one time more Did scale the heauens, as erst they did before. Long time dame Fortune tempred so her wheele, As that there was no vantage to be seene On any side, but equall was the gaine. But at the length so God and Fates decreed, Alphonsus was the victor of the field: And Amuracke became his prisoner. Who so remaind, vntill his daughter came: And by her marying, did his pardon frame. Exit Venus. Strike vp alarum, flie Amuracke, follow Alphonsus, and take him prisoner: carrie him in. Strike vp alarum, flie Crocon and Faustus. Enter Fausta and Iphigina with their armie, and meete them, and say. Fau. You Turkish kings, what sudden flight is this? What meanes the men which for their valiant prowes Were dreaded erst, cleane through the triple world, Thus cowardly to turne their backes and flie? What froward fortune hapned on your side: I hope your king in safetie doth abide? Cro. I noble madam, Amurack doth liue: And long I hope he shall enioy his life. But yet I feare, vnles more succour come, We shall both loose our king and soueraigne. Fau. How so king Crocon, dost thou speak in iest? To proue if Fausta would lament his death? Or else hath any thing hapt him amis? Speake quickly Crocon what the cause might be, That thou dost vtter forth these words to me? Cro. Then worthie Fausta know, that Amuracke Our mightie king, and your approued spowse, Prickt with desire of euerlasting fame, As he was pressing in the thickest rankes Of Aragonians, was with much adoo At length tooke prisoner, by Alphonsus hands. So that vnles you succour soone do bring, You loose your spowse, and we shall want our king. Iphi. Oh haples hap, oh dire and cruell fate! What iniurie hath Amuracke my sire Done to the Gods, which now I know are wrath? Although vniustly and without a cause. For well I wot, not any other king Which now doth liue, or since the world begun Did sway a scepter, had a greater care To please the Gods, then mightie Amuracke. And for to quite our fathers great good will, Seeke they thus basely all his fame to spill. Fau. Iphigina, leaue off these wofull tunes, It is not words can cure and ease this wound: But warlike swords, not teares, but sturdie speares: High Amuracke is prisoner to our foes. What then? thinke you that our Amazones Ioynd with the forces of the Turkish troupe, Are not sufficient for to set him free? Yes daughter yes, I meane not for to sleepe, Vntill he is free, or we him company keepe. March on my mates. Exeunt omnes. Strike vp alarum, flie Alphonsus, follow Iphigina and say. Iphi. How now Alphonsus, you which neuer yet Could meete your equall in the feates of armes, How haps it now that in such sudden sort You flie the presence of a sillie maide? What haue you found mine arme of such a force, As that you thinke your bodie ouerweake For to withstand the furie of my blowes? Or do you else disdaine to fight with me: For staining of your high nobilitie? Alp. No daintie dame, I wold not haue thee think That euer thou or any other wight, Shall liue to see Alphonsus flie the field From any king or Keisar who some ere, First will I die in thickest of my fo, Before I will disbase mine honour so. Nor do I scorne thou goddes for to staine My prowes with thee, although it be a shame For knights to combat with the female sect. But loue sweete mouse hath so benumbd my wit, That though I would, I must refraine from it. Iphi. I though as much when first I came to wars, Your noble acts were fitter to be writ Within the Tables of dame Venus sun, Then in God Mars his warlike registers. When as your Lords are hacking helmes abroad, And make their speares to shiuer in the aire, Your mind is busied in fond Cupid toyes. Come on I faith, ile teach you for to know We came to fight, and not to loue I trow. Alph. Nay virgin stay, and if thou wilt vouchsafe To entertaine Alphonsus simple sute, Thou shalt ere long be Monarch of the world: All christned kings, with all your Pagan dogs Shall bend their knees vnto Iphigina. The Indian soyle shalbe thine at command, Where euery step thou settest on the ground, Shall be receiued on the golden mines. Rich Pactolus that riuer of account, Which doth descend from top of Tiuole mount, Shall be thine owne, and all the world beside: If you will graunt to be Alphonsus bride. Iphi. Alphonsus bride? nay villain do not thinke That fame or riches can so rule my thoughts, As for to make me loue and fancie him Whom I do hate, and in such sort despise, As if my death could bring to passe his baine: I would not long from Plutoes port remaine. Alph. Nay then proud pecock since thou art so stout, As that intreatie will not moue thy minde For to consent to be my wedded spowse, Thou shalt in spite of Gods and Fortune too, Serue high Alphonsus as a concubine. Iphi. Ile rather die then euer that shall hap. Alphon. And thou shalt die vnles it come to pas. Alphonsus and Iphigina fight, Iphigina flie, follow Alphonsus. Strike vp alarum. Enter Alphonsus with his rapier, Albinius, LÃ¦lius, Miles, with their souldiers. Amurack, Fausta, Iphigina, Crocon and Faustus all bounde with their bands behind them, Amuracke looke angerly on Fausta. Enter Medea, and say. Med. Nay Amurack this is no time to iarre, Although thy wife did in her franticke moode Vse speeches which might better haue bene sparde, Yet do thou not iudge the same time to be A season to requite that iniurie: More fitteth thee with all the wit thou hast, To call to mind which way thou maist release Thy selfe, thy wife, and faire Iphigina, Forth of the power of stout Alphonsus hands. For well I wot, since first you breathed breath, You neuer were so nie the snares of death. Now Amurack, your high and kingly seate, Your royall scepter, and your stately Crowne, Your mightie Countrey, and your men at armes, Be conquered all, and can no succour bring. Put then no trust in these same paltrie toyes: But call to mind that thou a prisoner art: Clapt vp in chaines, whose life and deaths depends Vpon the hands of thy most mortall foe. Then take thou heed that what some ere he say, Thou doest not once presume for to gainsay. Amu. Away you foole, thinke you your cursed charmes Can bridle so the mind of Amuracke, As that he will stand croaching to his foe? No no, be sure that if that beggers brat Do dare but once to contrary my will, Ile make him soone in heart for to repent, That ere such words gainst Amuracke he spent. Med. Then since thou dost disdaine my good aduise, Looke to thy selfe, and if you fare amis Remember that Medea counsell gaue, Which might you safe from all those perils saue. But Fausta you, as well you haue begun, Beware you follow still your friends aduise. If that Alphonsus do desire of thee To haue your daughter for his wedded spowse, Beware you do not once the same gainsay: Vnles with death he do your rashnes pay. Fau. No worthie wight, first Fausta means to die, Before Alphonsus she will contrarie. Med. Why then farwell, but you Iphigina, Beware you do not ouersqueamish wax, When as your mother giueth her consent. Iphi. The Gods forbid that ere I should gainsay That which Medea bids me to obay. Exit Medea. Rise vp Alphonsus out of his chaire, who all this while hath bene talking to Albinius, and say. Al. Now Amurack the proud blasphemous dogs (For so you termed vs) which did brall and raile Against God Mars, and fickle Fortunes wheele, Haue got the gole for all your solemne praiers: Your selfe are prisoner, which as then did thinke That all the forces of the triple world, Were insufficient to fulfill the same. How like you this? is Fortune of such might, Or hath God Mars such force or power diuine, As that he can with all the power he hath, Set thee and thine forth of Alphonsus hands? I do not thinke but that your hopes so small, As that you would with verie willing mind, Yeeld for my spowse the faire Iphigina, On that condition, that without delay, Fausta and you may scotfree scape away. Amu. What thinkst thou vilain that high Amurack Beares such a minde, as for the feare of death, Heele yeeld his daughter, yea his onely ioy, Into the hands of such a dunghill Knight? No traytor no, for as now I lie Clapt vp in Irons, and with bolts of steele: Yet do there lurke within the Turkish soyle, Such troupes of souldiers, that with small ado, Theile set me scotfree from your men and you. Alp. Villain sayest thou, traitor &amp; dunghil knight, Now by the heauens, since that thou dost denie, For to fulfill that which in gentle wise Alphonsus craues, both thou and all thy traine Shall with your liues requite that iniurie. Albinius lay holde of Amuracke, And carrie him to prison presently, There to remaine vntill I do returne Into my tent, for by high Ioue I vowe, Vnles he waxe more calmer out of hand, His head amongst his fellow Kings shall stand. Albinius carrie Amuracke forth, who as he is a going, must say. Amu. No villaine, thinke not that the feare of death Shall make me calmer while I draw my breath. Alphon. Now LÃ¦lius, take you Iphigina, Her mother Fausta, with these other Kings, And put them into prisons seuerally: For Amuracke stout stomacke shall vndo, Both he himselfe and all his other crew. Fausta kneele downe. Fau. Oh sacred Prince, if that the salt-brine teares, Distilling downe poore Faustas withered cheekes, Can mollifie the hardnes of your heart. Lessen this iudgement, which thou in thy rage, Hast giuen on thy luckles prisoners. Alphon. Woman away, my word is gone and past, Now if I would I cannot call it backe: You might haue yeelded at my first demaund, And then you need not to feare this hap. LÃ¦lius make haste, and go thou presently, For to fulfill that I commanded thee. Rise vp Fausta, kneele downe Iphigina, and say. Iphi. Mightie Alphonsus, since my mothers sute Is so reiected, that in any case You will not grant vs pardon for her sake, I now will trie, if that my wofull prayers May plead for pittie at your graces feete. When first you did amongest the thickest ranckes All clad in glittering armes encounter me: You know your selfe what loue you did protest, You then did beare vnto Iphigina, Then for that loue if any loue you had, Reuoke this sentence which is too too bad. Alp. No damsel damsel, he that will not when he may, When he desires, shall surely purchase nay. If that you had when first I profer made, Yeelded to me, marke what I promist you, I would haue done, but since you did denie, Looke for deniall at Alphonsus hands. Rise vp Iphigina, and stand aside, Alphonsus talke with Albinius. Enter Carinus in his Pilgrims clothes, and say. Oh friendly Fortune, now thou shewest thy power, In raising vp my sonne from banisht state, Vnto the top of thy most mightie wheele: But what be these, which at his sacred feete Do seeme to pleade for mercie at his hands? Ile go and sift this matter to the full. Go toward Alphonsus and speake to one of his soldiers. Sir Knight, and may a Pilgrim be so bolde To put your person to such mickle paine, For to enforme me what great King is this, And what these be, which in such wofull sort, Do seeme to seeke for mercie at his hands? Soul. Pilgrim, the King that sits on stately throne, Is cald Alphonsus, and this matron hight, Fausta the wife to Amuracke the Turke: That is their daughter faire Iphigina: Both which togither, with the Turke himselfe, He did take prisoners in a battle fought. Spie out Carinus and say. Alph. And can the gods be found so kind to me, As that Carinus now I do espie: Tis he indeed, come on Albinius, The mightie conquest which I haue atchieu'd And victories the which I oft haue haue wonne, Bring not such pleasure to Alphonsus hart, As now my fathers presence doth impart. Alphonsus and Albinius go toward Carinus, Alphonsus stand looking on Carinus, Carinus say. Cari. What nere a word Alphonsus, art thou dumb? Or doth my presence so perturbe thy minde, That for because I come in Pilgrims weed, You thinke each word which you do spend to me A great disgrace vnto your name to be? Why speakest thou not? if that my place you craue, I will be gone and you my place shall haue. Alph. Nay father stay, the Gods of heauen forbid, That ere Alphonsus should desire or wish To haue his absence whom he doth account To be the Loadstone of his life. What though the fates and fortune both in one, Haue bene content to call your louing sonne, From beggers state, vnto this princely seate, Should I therefore disdaine my aged sire? No first both Crowne and life I will detest, Before such venome breed within my brest. What erst I did, the sudden ioy I tooke, To see Carinus in such happie state, Did make me do, and nothing else at all, High Ioue himselfe do I to witnes call. Cari. These words are vaine, I knew as much before: But yet Alphonsus I must wonder needs, That you whose yeares are proue to Cupids snares, Can suffer such a Goddes as this dame, Thus for to shead such store of Christall teares. Beleeue me sonne, although my yeares be spent, Her sighes and sobs in twaine my heart do rent. Alph. Like power deare father had she ouer me, Vntill for loue, I looking to receiue Loue backe againe, not onely was denied, But also taunted in most spightfull sort: Which made me loathe that which I erst did loue, As she her selfe, with all her friends shall proue. Cari. How now Alphonsus, you which haue so l?g Bene trained vp in bloudie broyles of Mars, What know you not, that Castles are not wonne At first assault, and women are not wooed When first their suters profer loue to them: As for my part, I should account that maide A wanton wench, vnconstant lewde and light, That yeelds the field, before she venture fight, Especially vnto her mortall foe, As you were then vnto Iphigina. But for because I see you fitter are To enter Lists and combat with your foes, Then court faire Ladyes in God Cupids tents, Carinus meanes, your spokesman for to bee, And if that she consent, you shall agree. Alphon. What you commaund, Alphonsus must not flie: Though otherwise perhaps he would denie. Cari. Then daintie damsell stint these trickling teares, Cease sighes and sobs, yea make a merrie cheare, Your pardon is already purchased: So that you be not ouer curious In granting to Alphonsus iust demand. Iphi. Thankes mightie Prince, no curioser ile bee, Then doth become a maide of my degree. Cari. The Gods forbid that ere Carinus tongue Should go about to make a mayd consent Vnto the thing which modestie denies: That which I aske, is neither hurt to thee, Danger to parents, nor disgrace to friends, But good and honest, and will profit bring, To thee and those which leane vnto that thing. And that is this, since first Alphonsus eyes, Did hap to glaunce vpon your heauenly hew, And saw the rare perfection of the same, He hath desired to become your spowse. Now if you will vnto the same agree, I dare assure you, that you shall be free. Iph. Pardon deare Lord, the world goes very hard, When women kinde are forced for to wooe, If that your sonne had loued me so well, Why did he not informe me of the same? Ca. Why did he not? what haue you clean forgot What ample profers he did make to you, When hand to hand he did encounter you? Iphi. No worthy sir, I haue not it forgot, But Cupid cannot enter in the brest, Where Mars before had tooke possession: That was no time to talke of Venus games, When all our fellowes were pressed in the warres. Cari. Well, let that passe, now canst thou be content To loue Alphonsus, and become his spowse? Iphi. I if the high Alphonsus could vouchsafe To entertaine me as his wedded spowse. Alphon. If that he could? what dost thou doubt of that Iason did iet when as he had obtaind, The golden fleece by wise Medeas art, The Greekes reioyced when they had subdued The famous bulwarkes of most stately Troy, But all their mirth was nothing in respect Of this my ioy, since that I now haue got, That which I long desired in my heart. Ca. But what sayes Fausta to her daughters choice? Fau. Fausta doth say, the Gods haue bin her friends To let her liue to see Iphigina Bestowed so vnto her hearts content. Alphon. Thankes mightie Empresse for your gentlenes, And if Alphonsus can at any time With all his power requite this curtesie, You shall perceiue how kindly he doth take Your forwardnesse in this his happie chance. Cari. Albinius go call forth Amuracke, Weele see what he doth say vnto this match. Exit Albinius, bring forth Amuracke. Most mightie Turke, I with my warlike sonne Alphonsus, loathing that so great a Prince As you should liue in such vnseemly sort, Haue sent for you to profer life or death: Life, if you do consent to our demand, And death if that you dare gainsay the same, Your wife, high Fausta, with Iphigina, Haue giuen consent that this my warlike sonne Should haue your daughter for his bedfellow, Now resteth nought but that you do agree, And so to purchase sure tranquilitie. Amu. Now Amurack aduise thee what thou sayest, Bethinke thee well what answere thou wilt make: Thy life and death dependeth on thy words, If thou denie to be Alphonsus sire, Death is thy share: but if that thou consent, Thy life is sau'd, consent? nay rather die. Should I consent to giue Iphigina Into the hands of such a beggers brat? What Amuracke thou dost deceiue thy selfe, Alphonsus is the sonne vnto a King: What then? the worthy of thy daughters loue She is agreed, and Fausta is content: Then Amuracke will not be discontent. Take Iphigina by the hand, giue her to Alphonsus. Heere braue Alphonsus, take thou at my hand, Iphigina, I giue her vnto thee: And for her dowrie, when her father die, Thou shalt possesse the Turkish Emperie. Take her I say, and liue King Nestors yeeres, So would the Turke and all his Noble Peeres. Alphon. Immortall thanks I giue vnto your grace. Cari. Now worthy Princes, since by helpe of Ioue On either side the wedding is decreed, Come let vs wend to Naples speedily, For to solemnize it with mirth and glee. Amu. As you do will, we ioyntly do agree. Exeunt omnes. Enter Venus with the Muses, and say. Ve. Now worthy Muses with vnwilling mind, Venus is forst to trudge to heauens againe: For Iuppiter that God of peerles power, Proclaimed hath a solemne festiuall, In honour of dame Danaes luckles death: Vnto the which, in paine of his displeasure He hath inuited all the immortall Gods And Goddesses, so that I must be there, Vnlesse I will his high displeasure beare: You see Alphonsus hath with much ado, At length obtaind fayre Iphigina Of Amuracke her father, for his wife. Who now are going to the Temple wards, For to performe dame Iunoes sacred rites, Where we will leaue them till the feast be done: Which in the heauens by this time is begun, Meane time deare Muses, wander you not farre Foorth of the path of high Pernassus hill: That when I come to finish vp his life, You may be readie for to succour me. Adieu deare dames, farwell Calliope. Exit Venus. Or if you can conueniently, let a chaire come downe from the top of the stage, and draw her vp. Calli. Adieu you sacred Goddes of the skie. Well louing sisters, since that she is gone, Come let vs haste vnto Pernassus hill, As Citherea did lately will. Melpom. Then make you haste her mind for to fulfill. Exeunt omnes, playing on their Instruments. FINIS.</field>
