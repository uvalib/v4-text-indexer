      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Our Author thinks 'tis not i'th power of Wit, Invention, Art, nor Industrie, to fit The several phantasies which in this age With a predominant humour rule the Stage. Some men cry out for Satyr, others chuse Meerly to story to confine each Muse; Most like no Play, but such as gives large birth To that which they judiciously term mirth. Nor wil the best works with their liking crown, Except't be grac'd with part of foole or clown. Hard and severe the task is then to write, So as may please each various appetite. Our Author hopes wel though, that in this Play, He has endeavour'd so, he justly may Gain liking from you all, unlesse those few Who wil dislike, be't ne're so good, so new; The rather Gentlemen, he hopes, cause I Am a main Actor in this Tragedie: You've grac'd me sometimes in another Sphear, And I do hope you'l not dislike me here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Scena 1. Enter Selinthus, Gaselles, and Osman. Sel. No murmurings, Noble Captains. Gas. Murmurings, Cosen? this Peace is worse to men of war and action then fasting in the face o'th'so, or lodging on the cold earth. Give me the Camp, say I, where in the Sutlers palace on pay-day we may the precious liquor quaff, and kisse his buxome wife; who though she be not clad in Persian Silks, or costly Tyrian Purples, has a clean skin, soft thighes, and wholsome corps, fit for the trayler of the puissant Pike, to sollace in delight with. Os. Here in your lewd Citie, the Harlots do avoid us sons o'th'Sword, worse then a severe Officer. Besides, here men o'th'Shop can gorge their mustie maws with the delicious Capon, and fat limbs of Mutton large enough to be held shoulders o'th'Ram ancouge the 12 Signes, while for pure want your souldier oft dines at the charge o'th'dead, 'mong tombs in the great Mosque. Sel. 'Tis beleev'd Coz, and by the wisest few too, that i'th'Camp you do not feed on pleasant poults; a sallad, and without oyl or vinegar, appeases sometimes your guts, although they keep more noise then a large pool ful of ingendring frogs. Then for accoutrements, you wear the Buff, as you believ'd it heresie to change for linnen: Surely most of yours is spent in lint, to make long tents for your green wounds after an onslaught. Gas. Coz. these are sad truths, incident to fraile mortals! Sel. You yet crie out with more eagernesse stil for new wars, then women for new fashions. Os. 'Tis confess'd, Peace is more opposite to my nature, then the running ach in the rich Usurers feet, when he roars out, as if he were in hel before his time. Why, I love mischief, Coz, when one may do't securely; to cut throats with a licencious pleasure; when good men and true o'th Jurie, with their frostie beards shall not have power to give the noble wesand, which has the steele defied, to th'hanging mercy of the ungracious cord. Sel. Gentlemen both, and Cozens mine, I do believe't much pity, to strive to reconvert you from the faith you have been bred in: though your large discourse and praise, wherein you magnifie your Mistriss, Warr, shall scarce drive me from my quiet sheets, to sleep upon a turfe. But pray say, Cozens. How do you like your General, Prince, is he a right Mars? Gas. As if his Nurse had lapt him in swadling clouts of steele; a very Hector and Alcibiades. Sel. It seems he does not relish these boasted sweets of warre: for all his triumphs, he is reported melancholy. Os. Want of exercise renders all men of actions, dul as dormise; your Souldier only can dance to the Drum, and sing a Hymn of joy to the sweet Trumpet: there's no musick like it. Enter Abrahen, Mura, and Simanthes. Ab. I'll know the cause, he shall deny me hardly else. Mu. His melancholy, known whence it rises once, 't may much conduce to help our purpose. Gas. Pray Coz. what Lords are these? they seem as ful of plot, as Generals are in Siege, they're very serious. Sel. That young Stripling is our great Emperors son, by his last wife: that in the rich Imbroidery's, the Court Hermes; one that has hatcht more projects, then the ovens in Egypt chickens; the other, though they cal friends, his meer opposite Planet Mars, one that does put on a reserv'd gravitie, which some call wisdom, the rough Souldier Mura, Governour i'th'Moroccos. Os. Him we've heard of before: but Cozen, shal that man of trust, thy tailor, furnish us with new accoutrements? hast thou tane order for them? Sel. Yes, yes, you shal flourish in fresh habiliments; but you must promise me not to ingage your corporal oathes you wil see't satisfied at the next press, out of the profits that arise from ransome of those rich yeomans heires, that dare not look the fierce foe in the face. Gas. Doubt not our truths, though we be given much to contradictions, we wil not pawn oaths of that nature. Sel. Wel then, this note does fetch the garments: meet me Cozens anon at Supper. Exeunt Gas. Os. Os. Honourable Coz. we wil come give our thanks. Enter Abilqualit Ab. My gracious brother, make us not such a stranger to your thoughts, to consume all your honors in close retirements; perhaps since you from Spain return'd a victor, with (the worlds conqueror) Alexander, you greive Nature ordain'd no other earths to vanquish; is't be so, Princely brother, we'le bear part in your heroique melancholy. Abil. Gentle youth. press me no farther, I stil hold my temper free and unshaken, only some fond thoughts of trivial moment, cal my faculties to private meditations. Sim. Howsoe're your Hignesse does please to term them, 'tis meer melancholy, which next to sin, is the greatest maladie that can oppress mans soul. Sel. They say right: and that your Grace may see what a meer madnesse, a very mid-summer frenzy, 'tis to be melancholy, for any man that wants no monie, I (with your pardon) wil discusse unto you all sorts, all sizes, persons and conditions, that are infected with it; and the reasons why it in each arises. Ab. Learned Selinthus, Let's tast of thy Philosophie Mu. Pish, 'Tis unwelcome to any of judgment, this fond prate: I marvel that our Emperor dos permit fools to abound ith'Court! Sel. What makes your grave Lordship in it, I do beseech you? But Sir, mark me, the kernel of the text enucleated, I shall confute, refute, repel, refel, explode, exterminate, expunge, extinguish like a rush candle, this same heresie, that is shot up like a pernicious Mushroom, to poison true humanitie. Ab. You shall stay and hear a lecture read on your disease; you shal, as I love virtue. Sel. First the cause then from whence this flatus Hypocondriacus this glimmering of the gizard (for in wild fowl, 'tis term'd so by Hypocrates) arises, is as Averroes and Avicen, with Abenbucar, Baruch and Aboflii, and all the Arabick writers have affirm'd, a meer defect, that is as we interpret, a want ofâ Abil. Of what, Selinthus? Sel. Of wit, and please your Highnesse, That is the cause in gen'ral, for particular and special causes, they are all deriv'd from severall wants; yet they must be considerd, pondred, perpended, or premeditated. Sim. My Lord, y'ad best be brief, your Patient will be wearie else. Sel. I cannot play the fool rightly, I mean, the Physician without I have licence to expalcat on the disease. But (my good Lord) more briefly, I shall declare to you like a man of wisdom and no Physician, who deal all in simples, why men are melancholy. First, for your Courtier. Sim. It concerns us all to be attentive, Sir. Sel. Your sage and serious Courtier; who does walk with a State face, as he had drest himself ith'Emperors glasse, and had his beard turn'd up by the' irons Roial, he will be as pensive as Stallion after Catum, when he wants suits, begging suits, I mean. Me thinks, (my Lord) you are grown something solemn on the sudden; since your Monopolies and Patents, which made your purse swell like a wet spunge, have been reduc'd to th'last gasp. Troth, it is far better to confesse here, then in a worser place. Is it not so indeed? Abil. What ere he does by mine, I'me sure h'as hit the cause from whence your grief springs, Lord Simanthes. Sel. No Egyptian Soothsayer has truer inspirations, then your small Courtiers from causes and wants manifold; as when the Emperors count'nance with propitious noise does not cry chink in pocket, no repute is with Mercer, nor with Tailor; nay sometimes too the humor's pregnant in him, when repulse is given him by a Beautie: I can speak this though from no Memphian Priest, or sage Caldean, from the best Mistris (Gentlemen) an Experience. Last night I had a mind t'a comly Semstress, who did refuse me, and behold, ere since how like an Ass I look. Enter Tarifa. Tar. What, at your Counsels, Lords? the great Almanzor requires your presence, Mura; has decree'd the Warr for Persia. You (my gracious Lord) Prince Abilqualet, are appointed Chief: And you, brave spirited Abrahen, an Assistant to your victorious Brother: You, Lord Mura, destin'd Lieutenant General. Abil. And must I march against the foe, without thy company? I relish not th'imployment. Tar. Alas, my Lord, Tarifa's head's grown white beneath his helmet; and your good Father thought it charity to spare mine age from travel: though this ease will be more irksome to me then the toil of war in a sharp winter. Abr. It arrives just to our wish. My gracious brother, I anon shall wait on you: mean time, valiant Mura, let us attend my Father. Exeunt Ab. Mura, Sim. Abil. Good Selinthus, vouchsafe a while your absence, I shall have imployment shortly for your trust. Sel. Your Grace shall have as much power to command Selinthus, as his best fanci'd Mistress. I am your creature. Exit. Tar. Now, my Lord, I hope y'are cloath'd with all those resolutions that usher glorious minds to brave atchievements. The happy genius on your youth attendant declares it built for Victories and Triumphs; and the proud Persian Monarchie, the sole emulous opposer of the Arabique Greatnesse, courts (like a fair Bride) your Imperial Arms, waiting t'invest You Soveraigne of her beauties. Why are you dull (my Lord?) Your cheerful looks should with a prosp'rous augury presage a certain Victory: when you droop already, as if the foe had ravish'd from your Crest the noble Palm. For shame (Sir) be more sprightly; your sad appearance, should they thus behold you, would half unsoul your Army, Abil. 'Tis no matter, Such looks best sute my fortune. Know (Tarifa) I'm undispos'd to manage this great Voiage, and must not undertake it. Tar. Must not, Sir! Is't possible a love-sick youth, whose hopes are fixt on marriage, on his bridal night should in soft slumbers languish? that your Arms should rust in ease, now when you hear the charge, and see before you the triumphant Prize destin'd t'adorn your Valour? You should rather be furnish'd with a power above these passions; and being invok'd by the mighty charm of Honour, flie to atchieve this war, not undertake it. I'd rather you had said, Tarifa ly'd, then utter'd such a sound, harsh and unwelcome. Abil. I know thou lov'st me truly, and durst I to any born of woman, speak, my intentions, the fatal cause which does withdraw my courage from this imployment, which like health I covet, thou shouldst enjoy it fully. But (Tarifa) the said discov'ry of it is not fit for me to utter, much lesse for thy vertue to be acquainted with. Tar. Why (my Lord?) my loyaltie can merit no suspicion from you of falshood: whatsoere the cause be or good, or wicked, 't meets a trustie silence, and my best care and honest counsel shall indeavour to reclaim, or to assist you if it be good, if ill, from your bad purpose. Abil. Why, that I know (Tarifa. 'Tis the love thou bear'st to honour, renders thee unapt to be partaker of those resolutions that by compulsion keep me from this Voiage: For they with such inevitable sweetnesse invade my sense, that though in their performance my Fame and Vertue even to death do languish, I must attempt, and bring them unto act, or perish i'th'pursuance. Tar. Heaven avert a mischief so prodigious. Though I would not with over-sawcie boldnesse presse your counsels; yet pardon (Sir) my Loialtie, which timorous of your lov'd welfare, must intreat, beseech you with ardent love and reverence, to disclose the hidden cause that can estrange your courage from its own Mars, with-hold you from this Action so much ally'd to honour: Pray reveal it: By all your hopes of what you hold most precious, I do implore it; for my faith in breeding your youth in warrs great rudiments, relieve Tarifa's fears, that wander into strange unwelcome doubts, lest some ambitious frenzy 'gainst your imperial fathers dignitie has late seduc'd your goodness. Abr. No, Tarifa, I ne're durst aim at that unholy height in viperous wickednesse; a sinlesse, harmlesse (ist can be truly term'd one) 'tis my soul labours even to dispaire with: t'faine would out, did not my blushes interdict my language: 'tis unchast love, Tarifa; nay, tak't all, and when thou hast it, pity my misfortunes, to fair Caropia, the chast, vertuous wife to surly Mura. Tar. What a fool Desire is! with Giant strengths it makes us court the knowledg of hidden mysteries, which once reveal'd, far more inconstant then the air, it fleets into new wishes, that the coveted secret had slept still in oblivion. Abil. I was certaine 'twould fright thy innocence, and look to be besieged with strong disswasions from my purpose: but be assur'd, that I have tir'd my thoughts with all the rules that teach men moral goodnesse, so to reclaime them from this love-sick looseness; but they (like wholesome medicines misaplied) fac'd their best operation, fond and fruitlesse. Though I as wel may hope to kiss the Sun-beams 'cause they shine on me, as from her to gaine one glance of comfort; yet my mind, that pities it self with constant tendernesse, must needs revolve the cause of its calamity, and melt i'th'pleasure of so sweet a sadness. Tar. Then y'are undone for ever; Sir, undon beyond the help of councel or repentance. 'Tis most ignoble, that a mind unshaken by fear, should by a vain desire be broken; or that those powers no labour e're could vanquish, should be orecome and thral'd by sordid pleasure. Pray (Sir) consider, that in glorious war, which makes Ambition (by base men termed sin) a big and gallant Virtue, y'ave been nurs'd, lull'd (as it were) into your infant sleeps by th'surly noise o'th'trumpet, which now summons you to victorious use of your indowments: and shall a Mistrisse stay you! such a one too, as to attempt, then war it self's more dangerous! Abil. All these perswasions are to as much purpose, as you should strive to reinvest with peace, and all the joyes of health and life, a soul condemn'd to perpetuity of torments. No (my Tarifa) though through all disgraces, losse of my honour, fame, nay hope for Empire, I should be forc'd to wade to obtain her love; those seas of mischief would be pleasing streams, which I would hast to bath in, and passe through them with that delight thou would'st to victory, or slaves long chain'd to'th'oare, to sudden freedome. Tar. Were you not Abilqualit, from this time then our friendships (like two rivers from one head rising) should wander a dissever'd course, and never meet againe, unlesse to quarrel. Nay, old and stiffe, now as my iron garments, were you my son, my sword should teach your wildness a swift way to repentance. Y'are my Prince, on whom all hopes depend; think on your Father, that lively Image of majestick goodness, who never yet wrong'd Matron in his lust, or man in his displeasure. Pray conjecture your Father, Countrie, Army, by my mouth beseech your pietie to an early pittie of your yet unslain Innocence. No attention! Farwel: my praiers shall wait you, though my Counsels be thus despis'd. Farwel Prince! Exit. Abil. 'Las good man, he weeps. Such tears I've seen fall from his manly eyes once when ye lost a battel. Why should I put off my Reason, Valor, Honour, Virtue, in hopes to gain a Beautie, whose possession renders me more uncapable of peace, then I am now I want it? Like a sweet, much coveted banquet, 'tis no sooner tasted, but it's delicious luxury's forgotten. Besides, it is un lawful. Idle fool, there is no law, but what's prescribed by Love, Natures first moving Organ; nor can ought what Nature dictates to us be held vicious. On then, my soul, and destitute of fears, like an adventrous Mariner, that knows storms must attend him, yet dares court his peril, strive to obtain this happy Port. Mesithes (Loves cunning Advocate) does for me besiege (with gifts and vows) her Chastitie. She is compass'd with flesh, that's not invulnerable, and may by Love's sharp darts be pierc'd. They stand firm, whom no art can bring to Love's command. Enter Abrahen, Abr. My gracious brother! Abil. Dearest Abrahen, welcome. Tis certainly decreed by our dread Father, we must both march against th'insulting foe. How does thy youth, yet uninur'd to travel, relish the Imploiment? Abr. War is sweet to those that never have experienc'd it. My youth cannot desire in that big Art a nobler Tutor then you (my Brother) Like an Eglet following her dam, I shall your honour'd steps trace through all dangers, and be proud to borrow a branch, when your head's coverd ore with Lawrel, to deck my humbler temples. Abil. I do know thee of valiant active soul; and though a youth, thy forward spirit merits the Command of Chief, rather then Second in an Armie. Would heaven our Roial Father had bestow'd on thee the Charge of General. Abr. On me, Sir! Alas, 'tis fit I first should know those Arts that do distinguish Valour from wild rashness. A Gen'ral (Brother) must have abler nerves of Judgment, then in my youth can be hop'd for. Your self already like a flourishing Spring teeming with early Victories, the Souldier expects should lead them to new Triumphs, as if you had vanquisht fortune. Abil. I am not so ambitious (Abrahen) of particular glories, but I would have those whom I love partake them. This Persian war, the last of the whole East left to be managed, if I can perswade the great Almanzor, shall be the trophee of thy yet maiden Valour. I have done enough already to inform Succession, that Abilqualit durst on fiercest foes run to fetch Conquest home, and would have thy name as great as mine in Arms, that Historie might register, our Familie abounded with Heroes, born for Victorie. Abr. Tis an honour, which, though it be above my powers, committed to my direction, I would seek to manage with care above my yeers, and courage equal to his, that dares the horrid'st face of danger: But 'tis your noble courtesie would thrust this masc'line honor (far above his merits) on your regardless Brother; for my Father, he has no thought tending to your intentions; nor though your goodness should desire, would hardly be won to yeild consent to them. Abil. Why, my Abrahen, w'are both his sons, and should be both alike dear to's affections; and though birth hath given me the larger hopes and Titles, 'twere unnatural, should he not strive t'indow thee with a portion apted to the magnificence of his Off-spring. But thou perhaps art timorous, lest thy first essayes of valour should meet fate disastrous. The bold are Fortunes darlings. If thou hast courage to venture on this great imploiment, doubt not, I shall prevail upon our Father t'ordain thee Chief in this brave hopefull Voiage. Abr. You imagine me beyond all thought of gratitude; and doubt not that I'll deceive your trust. The glorious Ensignes waving i'th'air once, like so many Comets, shall speak the Persians funerals, on whose ruines we'l build to Fame and Victorie new temples, which shall like Pyramids preserve our memories, when we are chang'd to ashes. Abil. Be sure, continue in this brave minde; I'll instantly solicite our Father to confirm thee in the Charge of General. I'll about it. Exit. Abil. Farewel gracious Brother. This haps above my hopes. 'Las, good dull fool, I see through thy intents, clear, as thy soul were as transparent as thin air or Cristal. He would have me remov'd, march with the Armie, that he mean time might make a sure defeat on our aged fathers life and Empire: 'tmust be certain as the light. Why should not his with equall heat, be like my thoughts, ambitious? Be they as harmless as the prai'rs of Virgins, I'll work his ruine out of his intentions. He like a thick cloud stands 'twixt me and Greatnesse: Greatnesse, the wise mans true felicity, Honour's direct inheritance. My youth wil quit suspicion of my subtil practice: then have I surly Mura and Simanthes, my allyes by my dead Mothers bloud, my assistants, his Eunuch too Mesithes at my service. Simanthes shall inform the King, the people desire Prince Abilqualit's stay; and Mura whose blunt demeanour renders him oraculous, make a shrewd inference out of it. He is my half Brother, th'other's my Father; names, meer airie titles! Soveraigntie's onely sacred, Greatnesse goodnesse, true self-affection Justice, every thing righteous that's helpfull to create a King. Enter Mura, Simanthes. Abil. My trustie friends, y'are welcome: our fate's above our wishes; Abilqualit by whatso'ere pow'r mov'd to his own ruine, would fain inforce his charge of General on me, and stay at home. Sim. Why, how can this conduce t'advance our purpose? Abr. Tis the mainest engine could ever move to ruine him. Simanthes, you shall inform our Father, tis the people out of their tender love desires his stay. You (Mura) shall infer my Brothers greatnesse with people; out of it, how nice it is and dangerous. The air is open here; come, wee'll discourse with more secure privacie our purpose. Nothing's unjust, unsacred, tends to advance us to a Kingdom; that's the height of chance.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Scena 1. Enter Almanzor, Mura, and Simanthes. Al. How? not go, Simanthes? Sim. My dread Soveraign, I speak but what the well affected people out of their loyal care and pious duty injoyn'd me utter: they do look upon him as on your eldest Son, and next Successor, and would be loth the Persian War should rob their eies of light, their souls of joy and comfort, this flourishing Empire leave as it were widow'd of its lov'd Spouse: They humbly do beseech your Majesty would therefore destine some more fitting General, whose loss (as heaven avert such a misfortune) should it happen, might lesse concern the State. Al. 'Tis not the least among the blessings Heaven has showr'd upon us, that we are happie in such loving Subjects, to govern whom, when we in peace are ashes, we leave them a Successor whom they truly reverence: A loving people and a loving Soveraign makes Kingdoms truly fortunate and flourishing. But I beleeve (Simanthes) their intents, though we confirm them, will scarce take effect: My Abilqualit (like a Princely Lion, in view of's prey) wil scarcely be orecom to leave the honour of the Persian War, in's hope already vanquish'd by his valour, and rest in lazy quiet, while that Triumph is ravish'd by another. Sim. With the pardon of your most facred Majestie, 'tis fit then your great commands forbid the Princes Voyage: boldnesse inforces youth to hard atchievements before their time, makes them run forth like Lapwings from their warm nest, part of the shel yet sticking unto their downie heads. Sir, good successe is oft more fatal far then bad; one winning cast from a flatt'ring Die tempting a Gamester to hazard his whole fortunes. Mur. This is dull, fruitless Philosophy, he that falls nobly winns as much honour by his loss, as conquest. Sim. This rule may hold wel among common men, but not 'mong Princes. Such a prince as ours is, who knows as wel to conquer mens affections as he does enemies, should not be expos'd to every new cause, honourable danger. Prince Abilqualit's fair and winning carriage has stolne possession of the peoples hearts, they doate on him since his late Spanish conquest, as new made brides on their much coveted husbands; and they would pine like melancholy turtles, should they so soone lose the unvalued object both of their love and reverence: Howsoe're, what ere your awful wil (Sir) shall determine, as heaven, it by their strict obedience held sacred and religious. Al. Good Simanthes, let them receive our thanks for their true care of our dear Abilqualit. Wee'l consider of their request, say. Sim. Your highnesse humblest creature. Exit. Mu. I do not like this. Al. Like what? Valiant Mura, we know thy counsels so supremely wise, and thy true heart so excellently faithful, that whatsoere displeases thy sage Judgment, Almanzor's wisdome must account distastful. What is't dislikes thee? Mu. Your Majestie knows me a downright Souldier, I affect not words; but to be brief, I relish not your son should (as if you were in your tomb already) ingross so much the giddie peoples favours. 'Tis neither fit for him, nor safe for you to suffer it. Al. Why, how can they, Mura, Give a more serious testimony of reverence to me, then by conferring their affections, their pious wishes, zealous contemplations on him that sits the nearest to my heart, my Abilqualit, in whose hopeful virtues my age more glorious then in all my conquests? Mu. May you prove fortunate in your pious care of the Prince Abilqualit. But (my Lord) Mura is not so prone to idle language (the Parasits best ornament) to utter ought, but what (if you'l please to give him audience hee'l show you a blunt reason for. Al. Come, I see into thy thoughts, good Mura; too much care of us, informs thy loyal soul with fears the Princes too much popularity may breed our danger: banish those suspicions; neither dare they who under my long raign have been triumphant in so many blessings, have the least thought may tend to disobedience: or if they had, my Abilqualit's goodnesse would ne're consent with them to become impious. Mu. 'Tis too secure a confidence betrays minds valiant to irreparable dangers. Not that I dare invade with a foule thought the noble Princes loyalty; but (my Lord) when this same many headed beast (the people) violent, and so not constant in affections, subject to love of novelty, the sicknesse proper t'all humane specially light natures, do magnifie with too immoderate praises the Princes actions, doate upon his presence, nay chaine their souls to th'shadow of his foot-steps, as all excesses ought to be held dangerous, especially when they do aim at Scepters, their too much dotage speaks, you in their wishes are dead alreadie, that their darling hope the Prince might have the Throne once. Al. 'Tis confess'd, all this a serious truth. Mu. Their mad applauses oth'noble Prince, though he be truly virtuous, may force ambition into him, a mischief Seasing the soul with too much craft and sweetness, as pride or lust do's minds unstay'd and wanton: 'tmakes men like poyson'd rats, which when they'ave swallow'd the pleasing bane, rest not until they drink, and can rest then much lesse, until they burst with't. Al. Thy words are stil oraculous. Mu. Pray then think with what an easie toil the haughty Prince, a demy God by th'popular acclamations, nay, the world's Soveraign in the vulgar wishes, had he a resolution to be wicked, might snatch this diadem from your aged temples? What law so holy, tye of blood so mightie, which for a Crown, minds sanctified and religious have not presum'd to violate? How much more then may the soul dazling glories of a Scepter work in his youth, whose constitution's fierie, as overheated air, and has to fan it into a flame, the breath of love and praises blown by strong thought of his own worth and actions. Al. No more of this, good Mura. Mu. They dare already limit your intentions, demand (as 'twere) with cunning zeal (which rightly interpreted, is insolence) the Princes abode at home. I wil not say it is, but I guess, 'tmay be their subtle purpose while we abroad fight for a new kingdomes purchase depriv'd by that means of our faithful succors, they may deprive you of this crown, inforce upon the prince this Diadem; which however he may be loth t'accept, being once possessed of't and tasted the delights of supreme greatness, hee'l be more loath to part with. To prevent this, not that I think it wil, but that may happen, 'tis fit the Prince march. I'ave observed in him too of late a sullen Melancholly, whence rising i'le not conjecture; only I should grieve, Sir, beyond a moderate sorrow, traitorous practise should take that from you which with loyal blood ours and your own victorious arms have purchas'd. and now I have discharg'd my honest conscience censure on't as you please; henceforth I'me silent. Al. Would thou hadst been so now, thy loyal fears have made me see how miserable a King is, whose rule depends on the vain people suffrage. Black now and horrid as the face of storms appears al Abilqualits lovely vertues, because to me they only make him dangerous, and with great terror shall behold those actions which with delight before we view'd, and dotage; like Mariners that bless the peaceful seas, which when suspected to grow up tempestuous, they tremble at. Though he may stil be virtuous, 'tis wisdome in us, to him no injustice, to keep a vigilant eie o're his proceedings and the wild peoples purposes. Enter Abil. Al. Abilqualit! come to take your leave, I do conjecture. Abil. Rather, Sir, to beg your gracious licence, I may stil at home attend your dread commands, and that you'd please to nominate my hopeful brother Abrahen (in lieu of me) chief of your now raised Forces for th'Persian expedition. Al. Dare you (Sir) presume to make this suit to us? Abil. Why? (my roial Lord) I hope this cannot pull your anger on your most obedient Son: a true affection to the young Prince my brother, did beget this my request; I willingly would have his youth adorn'd with glorie of this conquest. No tree bears fruit in Autumn, 'less it blossome first in the Spring: 'tis fit he were acquainted in these soft years with military action, that when grown perfect man, he may grow up too perfect in warlike discipline. Al. Hereafter we shall by your appointment guide our Counsels. Why do you not intreat me to resigne my Crown, that you the peoples much lov'd minion may with't impale your glorious brow? Sir, henceforth or know your duty better, or your pride shall meet our just wak'd anger. To your Charge, and march with speed, or you shall know what 'tis to disobey our pleasure. When y'are King, learn to command your Subjects; I will mine (Sir.) You know your Charge, perform it. Exit Alm. and Mura. Abil. I have done. Our hopes (I see) resemble much the Sun, that rising and declining cast large shadows; but when his beams are dress'd in's midday brightnesse, yeelds none at all: when they are farthest from successe, their guilt reflection does display the largest shows of events fair and prosp'rous. With what a setled confidence did I promise my self, my stay here, Mura's wish'd departure? when stead of these, I finde my fathers wrath destroying mine intentions. Such a fool is self-compassion, soothing us to faith of what we wish should hap, while vain desire of things we have not, makes us quite forget those w'are possess'd of. Enter Abrahen. Abr. Alone the engine works beyond or hope or credit. How I hug with vast delight, beyond that of stoln pleasures forbidden Lovers taste, my darling Mistriss, my active Brain! If I can be thus subtle while a young Serpent, when grown up a Dragon how glorious shall I be in cunning practise? My gracious brother! Abil. Gentle Abrahen, I am griev'd my power cannot comply my promise: my Father's so averse from granting my request concerning thee, that with angrie frowns he did express rather a passionate rage, then a refusall civil, or accustom'd to his indulgent disposition. Abr. Hee's our Father, and so the tyrant Custome doth inforce us to yeeld him that which fools call natural, when wise men know 'tis more then servile duty, a slavish, blind obedience to his pleasure, be it nor just, nor honourable. Abil. O my Abrahen, these sounds are unharmonious, as unlookt for from thy unblemish'd innocence: though he could put off paternal pietie, 't gives no priviledg for us to wander from our filial dutie: though harsh, and to our natures much unwelcom be his decrees, like those of Heaven, we must not presume to question them. Abr. Not, if they concern our lives and fortunes? 'Tis not for my self I urge these doubts; but 'tis for you, who are my Brother, and I hope, must be my Soveraigne, my fears grow on me almost to distraction: Our Father's age betrayes him to a dotage, which may be dang'rous to your future safetie; he does suspect your loyaltie. Abil. How, Abrahen? Ab. I knew 'twould start your innocence; but 'tis truth, a sad and serious truth; nay his suspicion almost arriv'd unto a setled faith that y'are ambitious. Abil. 'Tis impossible. Ab. The glorious shine of your illustrious vertues are grown too bright and dazling for his eyes to look on as he ought, with admiration; and he with fear beholds them, as it were, through a perspective, where each brave action of yours survey'd though at remotest distance, appears far greater then it is. In brief, that love which you have purchas'd from the people that sing glad Hymns to your victorious fortunes, betraies you to his hate; and in this Voiage which he inforces you to undertake, he has set spies upon you. Abil. 'Tis so: afflictions do fal like hailstones, one no sooner drops, but a whole Showre does follow. I observ'd indeed, my Abrahen, that his looks and language was dress'd in unaccustom'd clouds, but did not imagine they'd presag'd so fierce a tempest. Ye gods, why do you give us gifts and graces, share your own attributes with men, your virtues, when they betray them to worse hate then vices? But Abrahen, prithee reconfirm my feares by testimonial how this can be truth; for yet my innocence with too credulous trust sooths up my soul, our father should not thus put that off which does make him so, his sweetnesse, to feed the irregular flames of false suspicions and soul tormenting jealousies. Ab. Why, to me, to me (my Lord) he did with strong Injunctions give a solicitous charge to overlook your actions. My Abrahen (quoth he) I'me not so unhappie, that like thy brother thou shouldst be ambitious, who does affect, 'fore thy ag'd Fathers ashes, with greedie lust my Empire. Have a strict and cautious diligence to observe his carriage, 'twil be a pious care. Mov'd with the base indignity, that he on 'me should force the office of a spy; your spy, my noble and much lov'd brother: my best manhood scarce could keep my angry tears in; I resolv'd I was in duty bound to give you early intelligence of his unjust intentions, that you in wisedome might prevent all dangers might fall upon you from them, like swift lightning, killing 'cause they invade with sudden fiercenesse. Abil. In afflicting me, misery is grown witty. Ab. Nay besides (Sir) the sullen Mura has the self same charge too consign'd and setled on him; which his blind duty will execute. O brother, your soft passive nature, do's like jet on fire when oyls cast on't, extinguish: otherwise, this base suspicion would inflame your sufferance, nay make the purest loyalty rebellious. However, though your too religious piety forces you 'ndure this foul disgrace with patience, look to your safety, brother, that dear safety which is not only yours, but your whole Empires: for my part, if a faithfull brothers service may ought avail you, tho against our father, since he can be so unnaturally suspicious, as your own thoughts, command it. Enter Selinthus and Mesithes. Sel. Come, I know, although th'ast lost some implements of manhood may make thee gracious in the sight of woman, yet th'ast a little engine, cal'd a tongue, by which thou canst orecome the nicest female, in the behalf of friend. Insooth, you Eunuchs may well be stil'd Pimps-royal, for the skill you have in quaint procurement. Mes. Your Lordship's merry, and would inforce on me what has been your office far oftner than the cunningst Squire belonging to the smock transitory. May't please your Highnesse. Abil. Ha! Mesithes. Ab. His countenance varies strangely, some affaire the Eunuch gives him notice of, 't should seem, begets much pleasure in him. Abil. Is this truth? Mes. Else let me taste your anger. Abil. My dear Abrahen, wee'l march to night, prethee give speedie Notice to our Lieutenant Mura, to collect the forces from their several quarters, and draw them into Battalia on the plain behind the Citie, lay a strict command he stir not from the Ensigns til our self arrive in person there. Be speedie, brother, a little hastie business craves our presence. We wil anon be with you, my Methises. Exeunt Abil. &amp; Mes. Sel. Can your grace imagine whether his highness goes now? Ab. No, Selinthus; canst thou conjecture at the Eunuchs business? what ere it was, his countenance seem'd much altred: Il'd give a talent to have certain knowledg what was Mesithes message. Sel. I'll inform you at a far easier rate. Mesithes businesse certes concern'd a limber petticoate, and the smock soft and slipperie; on my honour, has been providing for the Prince, some female that he takes his leave of Ladies flesh ere his departure. Ab. Not improbable, it may be so. Sel. Nay, certain (Sir) it is so: and I believe, your little bodie earnes after the same sport. You were once reported a wag would have had business of ingendring with surly Mura's Lady: and men may conjectute y'are no chaster then a vot'rie: yet though she would not solace your desires, there are as handsome Ladies wil be proud to have your Grace inoculate their stocks with your graft-royal. Ab. Thou art Selinthus stil, and wilt not change thy humor. I must go and find out Mura; so farwel Selinthus, thou art not for these warrs, I know. Exit. Sel. No truly, nor yet for any other, 'less't be on a naked yeilding enemie; though there may be as hot service upon such a foe as on those clad in steel: the little squadron, we civill men assault body to body, oft carry wild-fire, about them privately, that sindges us ith'service from the crown even to the sole, nay sometimes hair and all off. But these are transitory perills. Enter Gasilles, Osman. Couzens, I thought you had been dancing to the drum. Your General has given order for a march this night, I can assure you. Gas. It is Couzen, something of the soonest; but we are prepar'd at all times for the journey. Sel. To morrow morning may serve the turn though. Hark you, Couzens mine; if in this Persian War, you chance to take a handsome she Captive, pray you be not unmindfull of us your friends at home; I will disburse her ransome, Couzens, for I've a months mind to try if strange flesh, or that of our own Countrey has the compleater relish. Os. We will accomplish thy pleasure, noble Couzen. Sel. But pray do not take the first say of her your selves. I do not love to walk after any of my kindred ith'path of copulation. Gas. The first fruits shall be thy own, dear Couz. But shall we part (never perhaps to meet agen) with dry lips, my right honoured Coz? Sel. By no means, though by the Alcharon wine be forbidden, you Souldiers in that case make't not your faith. Drink water in the Camp, when you can purchase no other liquor; here you shall have plenty of wine, old and delicious. I'le be your leader, and bring you on, let who will bring you off. To the encounter, come let us march, Couzens. Exeunt Omnes. Song. Scena Secunda. Enter Abilqualit, Caropia, and Mesithes, Perilinda. Car. No more, my gracious Lord, where real love is needlesse are all expressions ceremonious: the amorous Turtles, that at first acquaintance strive to expresse in murmuring notes their loves, do when agreed on their affections change their chirps to billing. Abil. And in feather'd arms incompasse mutually their gawdy necks. Mes: How do you like these love tricks, Perilinda? Per. Very well; but one may sooner hope from a dead man to receive kindness, than from thee, an Eunuch. You are the coldest creatures in the bodies, no snow-balls like you. Mes. We must needs, who have not that which like fire should warm our constitutions, the instruments of copulation, girle, our toyes to please the Ladies. Abil. Caropia, in your well becoming pity of my extream afflictions and stern sufferings, you've shown that excellent mercy as must render what ever action you can fix on, virtuous. But Lady, I till now have been your tempter, one that desired hearing, the brave resistance you made my brother, when he woo'd your love, only to boast the glory of a conquest which seem'd impossible, now I have gain'd it by being vanquisher, I my self am vanquish'd your everlasting Captive. Car. Then the thraldome will be as prosperous as the pleasing bondage of palms, that flourish most when bowd down fastest; Constraint makes sweet and easie things laborious, when love makes greatest miseries seem pleasures. Yet 'twas ambition (Sir) join'd with affection that gave me up a spoil to your temptations. I was resolv'd, if ever I did make a breach on matrimonial faith, 't should be with him that was the darling of kind fortune as well as liberall nature; who possess'd the height of greatnesse to adorn his beauty; which since they both conspire to make you happy, I thought 'twould be a greater sin to suffer your hopefull person, born to sway this Empire, in loves hot flames to languish, by refusal to a consuming feaver, then t'infringe a vow which ne're proceeded from my heart when I unwillingly made it. Abil. And may break it with confidence, secure from the least guilt, as if't had only in an idle dream been by your fancy plighted. Madam, there can be no greater misery in love, than separation from the object which we affect; and such is our misfortune we must ith'infancy of our desires breath at unwelcome distance; ith'mean time, lets make good use of the most precious minuts we have to spend together. Car. Else we were unworthy to be titled lovers; but I fear loath'd Mura may with swift approach disturb our happinesse. Abil. By my command hee's mustring up our forces. Yet Mesithes, go you to Abrahen, and with intimations from us, strengthen our charge. Come my Caropia, love's wars are harmlesse, for who ere do's yeild, gains as much honor as who wins the field.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius Scena 1. Enter Abilqualit and Caropia, as rising from bed, Abrahen without, Perilinda. Abr. Open the door, I must and will have entrance unto the Prince my brother, as you love your life and safety and that Ladies honor, whom you are lodg'd in amorous twines with, do not deny me entrance to you, I am Abrahen, your loyal brother Abrahen. Abil. 'Tis his voice, and there can be no danger in't, Caropia, be not dismaid, though w'are to him discover'd. your fame shall taste no blemish by't. Now brother, 'tis something rude in you, thus violently to presse upon our privacies. Abr. My affection shall be my Advocate, and plead my care of your lov'd welfare, as you love your honour, haste from this place, or you'l betray the Lady to ruin most inevitable. Her husband has notice of your being here, and's comming on wings of jealousie and desperate rage to intercept you in your close delights. In breif, I over heard a trusty Servant of his ith'Camp come and declare your highnesse was private with Caropia: at which tidings the sea with greater haste when vext with tempests, so sudden and boystrous, flies not towards the shore, then he intended homewards. He by this needs must have gain'd the City; for with all my power I hasted hitherward, that by your absence you might prevent his veiw of you. Abil. Why? the slave dare not invade my person, had he found me in fair Caropias armes: 'twould be ignoble, now I have caus'd her danger, should I not defend her from his violence. I'le stay though he come arm'd with thunder. Abr. That will be a certain means to ruin her: To me count that cure, I'le stand between the Lady, and Mura's fury, when your very sight, giving fresh fire to th'injury, will incense him 'gainst her beyond all patience. Car. Nay, besides his violent wrath breaking through his allegiance, may riot on your person. Dear my Lord withdraw your self, there may be some excuse when you are absent thought on, to take off Mura's suspition: by our loves, depart I do beseech you. Hapless I was born to be most miserable. Abil. You shall over-rule me. Better it is for him with unhallowed hands to act a sacriledg on our Prophets tombe then to profane this purity with the least offer of injurie; be careful Abrahen, to thee I leave my heart. Farwel Caropia, your tears inforce my absence. Exit. Abil. Abr. Pray hast my Lord lest you should meet the inrag'd Mura: now Madam where are the boasted glories of that virtue, which like a faithful Fort withstood my batt'ries? demolish'd now, and ruin'd they appear; like a fair building toter'd from its base by an unruly whirlewind, and are now instead of love the objects of my pitie. Car. I'me bound to thank you Sir, yet credit me; my sin's so pleasing't 'cannot meet repentance. Were Mura here, and arm'd with all the horrors rage could invest his powers with; not forgiven Hermits with greater peace shal hast to death, then I to be the Martyr of this cause, which I so love and reverence. Abr. 'Tis a noble and wel becoming constancie, and merits a lover of those Supreme eminent graces, that do likeful winds swel the glorious Sails of Abilqualit's dignitie and beautie! yet Madam, let me tel you, though I could not envie my brothers happinesse, if he could have enjoy'd your priceless love with safetie, free from discoverie, I am afflicted beyond a moderate sorrow, that my youth which with as true a zeal, courted your love, should appear so contemptible to receive a killing scorn from you: yet I forgive you, and do so much respect your peace, I wish you had not sin'd so careleslly to be betray'd ith'first fruitions of your wishes to your suspicious husband. Car. 'Tis a fate Sir, which I must stand, though it come dress'd in flames, killing as circular fire, and as prodigious as death presaging Comets: there's that strength in love, can change the pitchie face of dangers to pleasing formes, make ghastly fears seeme beauteous; and I'me resolv'd, since the sweet Prince is free from Mura's anger, which might have been fatal if he should here have found him, unresistless I dare his utmost fury. Abr. 'Twil bring death with't sure as stifling dampe; and 'twere much pitie so sweet a beautie should unpitied fall, betrai'd to endlesse infamie; your husband knowes only that my brother in your chamber was entertained; the servant that betrayed you, curse on his diligence, could not affirm he saw you twin'd together: yet it is death by the law, you know, for any Ladie at such an hour, and in her husbands absence; to entertain a stranger. Car. 'Tis considered Sir, and since I cannot live to enjoy his love, I'le meet my death as willingly as I met Abilqualit's dear embraces. Abr. That were too severe a crueltie. Live Caropia, til the kind destinies take the loath'd Mura to their eternal Mansions, til he fal either in war a sacrifice to fortune, or else by stratagem take his destruction from angry Abilqualit, whose fair Empresse you were created for: there is a mean yet to save th'opinion of your honour spotlesse, as that of Virgin innocence, nay to preserve, (though he doth know (as certainly he must do) my Brother have injoy'd thee) thee stil precious in his deluding fancie. Car. Let me adore you if you can give effect to your good purpose. But tis impossible. Abr. With as secure an ease 't shal be accomplish'd as the blest desires of uncross'd lovers: you shal with one breath dissolve these mists that with contagious darknesse threaten the lights both of your life and honour. Affirm my brother ravish'd you. Car. How my Lord? Abr. Obtained by violence entry into your chamber where his big lust seconded by force, despight of yours and your Maids weak resistance surpris'd your honor: when't shall come to question, my brother cannot so put off the truth, he owes his own affection and your whiteness, but to acknowledg it a rape. Car. And so by saving mine, betray his fame and safety, to the lawes danger, and your fathers justice, which with impartial doome will most severely sentence the Prince, although his son. Abr. Your fears and too affectionate tendernesse wil ruine all that my care has builded. Sure, Mesithes has (as my charge injoin'd him) made relation Enter Mura. to him of Abilqualit's action. See your Husband, resolve on't, or y'are miserable. Mu. Furies, where is this lustful Prince, and this lascivious Strumpet? ha Abrahen, here? Abr. Good Cozen Mura, be not so passionate, it is your Prince has wrought your injury; resolve to bear your crosses like a man: the great'st afflictions should have the greatest fortitude in their suff'rings from minds resolv'd and noble. 'Las poor Ladie, 'twas not her fault; his too unruly lust 'tis, has destroi'd her puritie. Mu. Ha, in tears! Are these the liverie of your fears and penitence, or of your sorrows (minion) for being rob'd so soon of your Adulterer? Abr. Fie, your passion is too unmannerly; you look upon her with eyes of rage, when you with grief and pitie ought to surveigh her innocence. My Brother, degenerate as he is from worth, and meerly the beast of lust, (what 'fiends would fear to violate) has with rude insolence destroyed her honor, hy him inhumane ravished, Tar. Good Sir be so merciful as to set free a wretch from loath'd mortalitie, whose lifes so great and hateful burden now sh'as lost her honor: 'Twil be a friendly charitie to deliver her from the torment of it. Mu. That I could contract the soul of universal rage into this swelling heart, that it might be as ful of poisonous anger as a dragons when in a toile insnar'd. Caropia ravished! Me thinks the horror of the sound should fright to everlasting ruine, the whole world, start natures Genius. Abr. Gentle Madam, pray withdraw your self, your sight, til I have wrought a cure upon his temper, wil but adde to his affliction. Car. You're as my good Angel, I'll follow your directions. Exit. Abr. Cozen Mura, I thought a person of your masculine temper, in dangers fostred, where perpetual terrors have been your play-fellowes, would not have resented with such effeminate passion a disgrace, though ne're so huge and hideous. Mu. I am tame, collected now in all my faculties, which are so much oppress'd with injuries, they've lost the anguish of them: can you think, Sir, when all the winds fight, the inrag'd billows that use to imprint on the black lips of clouds a thousand brinie kisses, can lie stil, as in a lethargie? that when baths of oyl are pour'd upon the wild irregular flames in populous Cities, that they'll then extinguish? Your mitigations adde but seas to seas, give matter to my fires to increase their burning, and I ere long enlightned by my anger shall be my owne pile, and consume to ashes. Abr. Why, then I see indeed your injuries have ravished hence your reason and discourse, and left you the meere prostitute of passion. Can you repaire the ruins you lament so with these exclaimes? was ever dead man call'd to life again by fruitful sighs? or can your rage reedifie Caropias honour, slain and betrai'd by his foul lust? Your manhood, that heretofore has thrown you on all dangers, me thinks should prompt you to a noble vengance, which you may safely prosecute with Justice, to which this crime, although he be a Prince, Renders him liable. Mu. Yes, I'le have justice or I'le awake the sleepy Deities, or like the ambitious Gyants wage new wars with heaven it self, my wrongs shall steel my courage, and on this vicious Prince like a fierce Sea breach my just wak'd rage shall riot till it sink in the remorcelesse eddie, sink where time shall never find his name but with disgrace to taint his hatefull memory. Abr. This wildnesse neither befit your wisdom nor your courage, which should with setled and collected thoughts walk on to noble vengeance. He before was by our plots proscrib'd to death and ruine to advance me to the Empire; now with ease we may accomplish our designs Mu. Would heaven I nere had given consent, o'recome by love to you to have made a forfeit on my allegiance, 'tis a just punishment, I by him am wrong'd, whom for your sake I fearlesse sought to ruin. Abr. Are you repentant grown, Mura? this softnese? ill suits a person of your great resolves, on whom my fortunes have such firm dependance. Come, let Caropia's fate invoke thy vengeance to gain full mastry o're all other passions, leave not a corner in thy spacious heart unfurnish'd of a noble rage, which now will be an attribute of glorious justice: the law you know with loss of sight doth punish all rapes, though on mean persons; and our father is so severe a Justicer, not blood can make a breach upon his faith to justice. Besides, we have already made him dangerous in great Almanzors thoughts, and being delinquent he needs must suffer what the meanest offender merits for such a trespass. Mu. I'me awake now, the lethargy of horror and amaze that did obscure my reason, like those dul and lazy vapors that o'reshade the Sun, vanish, and it resumes its native brightness. And now I would not but this devil Prince had done this act uopn Caropia's whiteness, since't yeilds you free access unto the Empire, The deprivall of's sight do's render him incapable of future soveraignty. Abr. Thou'rt in the right, and hast put on manly considerations: Caropia (since shee's in her will untainted) ha's not forgon her honor: he dispatc'd once, as we will have him shortly, 't shall go hard else. a tenant to his marble, thou agen wedded in peace maist be to her pure vertues, and live their happy owner. Mu. I'le repair to great Almanzor instantly, and if his partial piety do descend to pitty, I will awake the Executioner of justice, death, although in sleep more heavy than he can borrow from his natural coldness; on this good sword I'le wear my causes justice till he do fall its sacrifice. Abr. But be sure you do't with cunning secresie, perhaps, should he have notice of your just intentions, he would repair to th'Army, from which safegard our best force could not pluck him without danger to the whole Empire. Mu. Doubt not but I'le manage with a discreet severity my vengeance, invoke Almanzors equity with sudden and private haste. Abr. Mean time I will go put a new design in practice that may be much conducing to our purpose. Like clocks, one wheele another on must drive, affairs by diligent labor only thrive. Exeunt. Scena Secunda. Enter Selinthus, Gaselles, Osman, and Souldiers. Sel. No quarrelling good Couzens, lest it be with the glass, 'cause 'tis not of size sufficient to give you a magnificent draught. You will have fighting work enough when you're i'th'wars, do not fall out among your selves. Os. Not pledg my peerlesse Mistresse health? Souldier, thou'rt mortall, if thou refuse it. Gas. Come, come, he shall pledg it, and 'twere a Tun. Why, w'are all as dull as dormise in our liquor: Here's a health to the Prince Abilqualit. Soul. Let go round: I'ld drink't, were it an Ocean of warm bloud flowing from th'enemie. Pray, good my Lord what news is stirring? Sel. It should seem, Souldier, thou canst not read; otherwise the learn'd Pamphlets that flie about the streets, would satisfie thy curiositie with news; they'r true ones, full of discreet intelligence. Os. Cosens, shal's have a Song? here is a Souldier in's time hath sung a dirge unto the foe oft in the field. Soul. Captain, I have a new one, the Souldiers Joy 'tis call'd. Sel. That is an harlot. Prethee be musicall, and let us taste the sweetnesse of thy voice. A Song. Gas. Whist, give attention. Soul. How does your Lordship like it? Sel. Very well. And so here's to thee. There's no drum beats yet, and 'tis cleer day; some hour hence 'twill be Enter Abr. Mes. time to break up the Watch. Ha! young Lord Abrahen, and trim Mesithes with him! what the divel does he make up so early? He has been a bat-fowling all night after those Birds, those Ladie-birds term'd wagtails; what strange business can he have here, tro? Abr. 'Twas wel done, Mesithes! and trust me, I shal find an apt reward, both for thy care and cunning. Prethee hast to Lord Simanthes, and deliver this note to him with best diligence, my dear Eunuch; thou'rt halfe the soul of Abrahen: Mes. I was borne to be intituled your most humble vassal; I'll hast to the Lord Simanthes. Exit. Sel. How he cringes! These youths that want the instruments of Manhood, are very supple in the hams. Abr. Good-morrow to noble Lord Selinthus: what companions have you got here thus early? Sel. Blades of metal, tall men of war, and't please your Grace, of my own blood and family, men who gather'd a sallad on the enemies ground, and eaten it in bold defiance of him; and not a Souldier here but's an Achylles, valiant as stoutest Mirmidon. Abr. And they never had juster cause to show their valor; the Prince my dearest brother, their Lord General's became a forfeit to the stern laws rigour; and 'tis imagin'd, our impartial father, wil sentence him to lose his eyes. Gas. Marry heaven defend, for what, and't like your Grace! Abr. For a fact which the severe law punishes with loss of natures precious lights; my tears wil scarce permit me utter't: for a rape committed on the fair wife of Mura. Os. Was it for nothing else, and please your Grace? ere he shal lose an eie for such a trifle, or have a haire diminish'd, we wil lose our heads; what, hood wink men like sullen hawks for doing deeds of nature! I'me asham'd the law is such an Ass. Sel. Some Eunuch Judg, that could not be acquainted with the sweets due to concupiscencial parts, invented this law, I'll be hang'd else. 's Life, a Prince, and such a hopeful one, to lose his eyes, for satisfying the hunger of the stomack beneath the wast, is crueltie prodigious, not to be suffer'd in a common-wealth of ought but geldings. Abr. 'Tis vain to sooth our hopes with these delusions, he wil suffer less he be reskued. I would have you therfore if you ow any service to the Prince, my much lamented brother, to attend without least tumult 'bout the Court, and if there be necessity of your ayd, I'le give you notice when to imploy it. Sel. Sweet Prince, wee'l swim in blood to do thee or thy brother service. Each man provide their weapons. Abr. You will win my brothers love for ever, nay my father, though hee'l seem angry to behold his justice deluded, afterwards when his rage is past, will thank you for your loyalties: Pray be there with all speed possible, by this my brothers commanded 'fore my father, I'le go learn the truth, and give you notice: pray be secret and firm to your resolves. Exit. Sel. For him that flinches in such a cause, I'le have no more mercy on him. Heres Tarifa Enter Tarifa and Mura. the Princes sometimes Tutor, Mura with him a walking towards the Court, let's take no notice of them, lest they discover our intentions by our grim looks. March fair and softly Couzens, wee'l be at Court before them. Tar. You will not do this, Mura! Mu. How Tarifa? will you defend him in an act so impious? Is't fit the drum should cease his surly language, when the bold Souldiers marches, or that I should passe o're this affront in quiet silence, which Gods and men invoke to speedy vengeance? which I will have, or manhood shall be tame as Cowardice. Tar. It was a deed so barbarous, that truth it self blushes as well as justice to hear it mention'd: but consider Mura, he is our Prince, the Empires hope, and pillar of great Almanzors age How far a publick regard should be prefer'd before your private desire of vengeance! which if you do purchace from our impartial Emperors equity, his loss of sight, and so of the succession, will not restore Caropia to the honor he ravish't from her. But so foule the cause is, I rather should lament the Princes folly than plead in his behalf. Mur. 'Tis but vain, there is your warrant, as you are high Marshal, to summon him to make his speedy appearance 'fore the Tribunall of Almanzor; so pray you execute your office. Exit. Tar. How one vice can like a small cloud when't breaks forth in showers, black the whole heaven of vertues! O my Lord, Enter Abilqualit, Muts, whispring, seem to make protestations. Exeunt. that face of yours which once with Angell brightnesse cheer'd my faint sight, like a grim apparition frights it with ghastly terror: you have done a deed that startles vertue till it shakes as it got a palsie. I'me commanded to summon you before your father, and hope you'l obey his mandate. Abil. Willingly, what's my offence, Tarifa? Tar. Would you knew not, I did presage your too unruly passions would hurry you to some disast'rons act, but ne're imagin'd you'd have been so lost to masculine honor, to commit a rape on that unhappy object of your love, whom now y'ave made the spoil of your foul lust, the much wrong'd wife of Mura. Abil. Why, do's Mura charge me with his Caropia's rape? Tar. This warrant sent by your angry father, testifies he means to appeach you of it. Abil. 'Tis my fortune, all natural motions when they approach their end, hast to draw to't with accustom'd swiftnesse. Rivers with greedier speed run neere their out-falls, than at their springs. But I'me resolv'd, let what happen that will, I'le stand it, and defend Carpoia's honor, though mine own I ruin; Who dares not dye to justifie his love, deserves not to enjoy her. Come, Tarifa, what e're befall, I'me resolute. He dies glorious, that falls loves innocent sacrifice. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Scena 1. Enter Almanzor, Abilqualit, Tarifa and Mura. Al. No more Tarifa, you'l provoke our anger, if you appear in this cause so solicitous, the act is too apparent: nor shal you need (injur'd Mura) to implore our justice, which with impartial doome shall fal on him more rigorously, then on a strange offender. O Abilqualit, (for the name of Son, when thou forsookst thy native virtue, left thee;) Were all thy blood, thy youth and fortunes glories of no more value, then to be expos'd to ruine for one vice; at whose name only the furies start, and bashful fronted justice hides her amaz'd head? But it is now bootless to shew a fathers pitie, in my grief for thy amiss. As I'me to be thy Judg, be resolute, I'll take as little notice, thou art my off-spring, as the wandring clouds do of the showers, which when they've bred to ripenesse, they straight disperse through the vast earth forgotten. Abil. I'me sorrie Sir, that my unhappie chance should draw your anger on me; my long silence declares I have on that excelling sweetnesse, that unexampled pattern of chast goodnesse; Caropia acted violence. I confess, I lov'd the Ladie, and when no perswasions serv'd to prevail on her, too stubborn, incenss'd, by force I sought my purpose and obtain'd it; nor do I yet (so much I prize the sweetnesse of that unvalued purchase) find repentance in any abject thought; what ere fals on me from your sterne rigor in a cause so precious, wil be a pleasing punishment. Al. You are grown a glorious malefactor, that dare brave thus the awful rod of justice! Lost young man, for thou'rt no child of mine, dost not consider to what a state of desperate destruction thy wild lust has betrai'd thee! What rich blessings (that I may make thee sensible of thy sins by showing thee thy suffering) hast thou lost by thy irregular folly! First my love, which never more must meet thee, scarce in pitie; the glorie flowing from thy former actions stopt up for ever; and those lustful eies, by whose deprival (thou'rt depriv'd of being capable of this Empire) to the law, which wil exact them, forfeited. Cal in there a Surgeon, and our Mutts to execute this act Enter Surg. Muts. of justice on the unworthie traitor, upon whom my just wak'd wrath shall have no more compassion, then the incens'd flames have on perishing wretches that wilfully leap into them. Tar. O my Lord, that which on others would be fitting justice, on him your hopeful though offending son, wil be exemplar crueltie; his youth Sir, that hath abounded with so many vertues, is an excuse sufficient for one vice: he is not yours only, hee's your Empires, destin'd by nature and successions priviledg, when you in peace are shrowded in your marble, to weild this Scepter after you. O do not, by putting out his eies, deprive your Subjects of light, and leave them to dul mournful darknesse. Al. 'Tis but in vain, I am inexorable. If those on which his eyes hang, were my heart strings, I'de cut them out rather then wound my Justice; nor dos't befit thy vertue intercede for him in this cause horrid and prodigious; the crime 'gainst me was acted; 'twas a rape upon my honour, more then on her whitenesse; his was from mine derivative, as each stream is from its spring; so that he has polluted by his foul fact, my fame, my truth, my goodnesse, strucken through my dignitie by his violence: nay, started in their peaceful urnes, the ashes of all my glorious Ancestors; defil'd the memorie of their stil descendent vertues; nay with a killing frost, nipt the fair blossomes, that did presage such goodly fruit arising from his own hopeful youth. Mur. I ask but justice; those eyes that led him to unlawful objects, tis fit should suffer for't a lasting blindnesse; the Sun himself, when he darts rayes lascivious, such as ingender by too piercing fervence intemperate and infectious heats, straight wears obscuritie from the clouds his own beams raises. I have been your Souldier Sir, and fought your battails; for all my services, I beg but justice, which is the Subjects best prerogative, the Princes greatest attribute; and for a fact, then which, none can be held more black and hideous, which has betrai'd to an eclipse the brightest star in th'heaven of vertues: the just law does for't ordain a punishment, which I hope you the laws righteous guider, wil according to equitie see executed. Tar. Why! that law was only made for common malefactors, but has no force to extend unto the Prince, to whom the law it self must become subject. This hopeful Prince, look on him, great Almanzor; and in his eyes, those volumes of all graces, which you like erring Meteors would extinguish: read your own lively figure, the best storie of your youths noblest vigor; let not wrath (Sir) o'recome your pietie, nay your humane pity. 'Tis in your brest, my Lord, yet to shew mercie; that precious attribute of heavens true goodnesse, even to your self, your son! me thinks that name should have a power to interdict your Justice in its too rigorous progress. Abil. Dear Tarifa, I'me more afflicted at the intercessions, then at the view of my approaching torments, which I wil meet with fortitude and boldness, too base to shake now at one personal danger, when I've incountred thousand perils fearless; Nor do I blame my gracious fathers Justice, though it precede his nature. I'ld not have him (for my sake) forfeit that for which hee's famous, his uncorrupted equitie, nor repine I at my destinie; my eies have had delights sufficient in Caropia's beauties, to serve my thoughts for after contemplations; nor can I ever covet a new object, since they can ne're hope to incounter any of equal worth and sweetness. Yet hark Tarifa, to thy secresie I wil impart my dearest, inmost counsels; if I should perish, as 'tis probable I may, under the hands of these tormentors; thou maist unto succession show my innocence; Caropia yeilded without least constraint, and I injoy'd her freely. Tar. How my Lord? Abil. No words on't, as you respect my honour! I'ld not lose the glorie I shall gain by these my sufferings; come grim fures, and execute your office. I wil stand you, unmov'd as hills at whirlewinds, and amidst the torments you inflict, retain my courage. Al. Be speedie villaines. Tar. O stay your cruel hands, you dumb ministers of injur'd Justice, and let me speak his innocence ere you further afflict his precious eye-sight. Al. What does this mean, Tarifa! Tar. O my Lord, the too much braverie of the Princes spirit 'tis has undone his fame, and pul'd upon him this fatal punishment; 'twas but to save the Ladies honour, that he has assum'd her rape upon him, when with her consent the deed of shame was acted. Mur. Tis his fears makes him traduce her innocence: he who did not stick to commit a riot on her person, can make no conscience to destroy her fame by his untrue suggestions. Al. 'Tis a basenesse beyond thy other villanie (had shee yeilded,) thus to betraie for transitorie torture, her honour, which thou wert ingag'd to safeguard even with thy life. A son of mine could never show this ignoble cowardize: Proceed to execution, I'll not hear him speak, he is made up of treacheries and falshoods. Tar. Wil you then be to the Prince so tyrannous? Why, to me just now he did confess his only motive to undergoe this torment, was to save Caropia's honour blameless. Abil. I am more troubled Sir, with his untimely frenzie, then with my punishment; his too much love to me, has spoild his temperate reason. I confess Caropia yeilded! Not the light is half so innocent as her spotlesse virtue. 'Twas not wel done, Tarifa, to betray the secret of your friend thus, though Shee yeilded: the terror of ten thousand deaths shall never force me to confess it. Tar. Agen, my Lord, even now he does confess, she yeilded, and protests that death shall never make him say shee's guiltie: the breath scarce pass'd his lips yet. Abil. Haplesse man, to run into this lunacie! Fie Tarifa, so treacherous to your Friend! Tar. Agen, agen. Wil no man give me credit? Enter Abrahen. Abr. Where is our roial father? where our brother? As you respect your life and Empires safetie, dismiss these tyrannous instruments of death and crueltie unexemplified. O Brother, that I should ever live to enjoy my eie-sight, and see one halfe uf your dear lights indanger'd. My Lord, you've done an act, which my just fears tels me, wil shake your Scepter! O for heavens sake, look to your future safetie; the rough Souldier hearing their much lov'd General, My good Brother was by the law betrai'd to some sad danger, have in their pietie beset the pallace; think on some means to appease them, ere their furie grow to its ful unbridled height; they threaten your life, great Sir: pray send my brother to them, his sight can only pacifie them. Al. Have you your Champions! We wil prevent their insolence, you shal not boast, you have got the Empire by our ruine. Muts, Strangle him immediately. Abr. Avert such a prodigious mischief, heaven, Hark, hark Enter, Enter. they're entred into th'Court; desist you monsters, my life shal stand betwixt his and this violence, or I with him wil perish. Faithful Souldiers, hast to defend your Prince, curse on your slowness. Hee's dead; my fathers turn is next. O horror, would I might sink into forgetfulnesse! What has your furie urg'd you to? Al. To that which whoso murmurs at, is a faithlesse traitor Enter Simanthes? to our tranquilitie. Now Sir, your business, Sim. My Lord, the Citie is up in arms, in rescue of the Prince; the whole Court throngs with Souldiers. Al. 'Twas high time to cut this viper off, that would have eat his passage through our very bowels to our Empire. Nay, we wil stand their furies, and with terror of Majestie strike dead these insurrections. Enter Souldiers. Traitors, what means this violence? Abr. O dear Souldiers, your honest love's in vain; my Brother's dead, strangled by great Almanzor's dire command, ere your arrival. I do hope they'l kill him in their hot zeal. Al. Why do you stare so, traitors? 'twas I your Emp'ror that have done this act, which who repines at, treads the self same steps of death that he has done. Withdraw and leave us, wee'ld be alone. No motion! Are you statues? Stay you, Tarifa here. For your part, Mura, you cannot now complain but you have justice; so quit our presence. Os. Faces about, Gentlemen. Exeunt. Abr. It has happ'ned above our wishes, we shall have no need now to imploy your handkercher. Yet give it me. You'r sure 'tis right, Simanthes. Al. Tarifa, I know the love thou bearst Prince Abilqualit makes thy big heart swell as't had drunk the fome of angry Dragons. Speak thy free intentions, Deserv'd he not this fate? Tar. No: You're a Tyrant, one that delights to feed on your own bowels, and were not worthie of a Son so vertuous. Now you have tane his, add to your injustice, and take Tarifa's life, who in his death, should it come flying on the wings of torments, would speak it out as an apparant truth: the Prince to me declar'd his innocence, and that Caropia yeelded. Al. Rise Tarifa; we do command thee, rise: a sudden chilnesse, such as the hand of winter casts on brooks, thrils our ag'd heart. I'll not have thee ingross sorrow alone for Abilqualit's death: I lov'd the boy well, and though his ambition and popularitie did make him dangerous, I do repent my furie, and will vie with thee in sorrow. How he makes death lovely! Shall we fix here, and weep till we be statues? Tar. Til we grow stiff as the cold Alablasters must be erected over us. Your rashnesse has rob'd the Empire of the greatest hope it ere shall boast agen. Would I were ashes. Al. He breathes (me thinks:) the over-hastie soul was too discourteous to forsake so fair a lodging, without taking solemn leave first of the owner. Ha, his handkercher! Thou'rt lib'ral to thy Father even in death, leav'st him a legacie to drie his tears, which are too slow; they should create a deluge. O my dear Abilqualit! Tar. You exceed now as much in grief as you did then in rage, One drop of this pious paternal softnesse had ransom'd him from ruine. Dear Sir, rise: my grief's divided, and I know not whether I should lament you living, or him dead. Good Sir, erect your looks. Not stir! His sorrow makes him insensible. Ha, there's no motion left in his vital spirits: The excesse of grief has stifled up his pow'rs, and crack'd (I fear) his ag'd hearts cordage. Help, the Emperor, he Emperor's dead; Help, help. Abrahen, Simanthes, Mesithes, Muts Abr. What dismal outcrie's this? our royal father dead! The handkercher has wrought I see. Tar. Yes; his big heart vanquish'd with sorrow, that in's violent rage, he doom'd his much lov'd son to timeless death, could not endure longer on its weak strings, but crack'd with weight of sorrow. Their two spirits, by this, are met in their delightful passage to the blest shades; we in our tears are bound to cal you our dread Soveraign. Omnes. Long live Abrahen Great Caliph of Arabia. Abr. 'Tis a title we cannot covet, Lords, it comes attended with so great cares and troubles, that our youth start at the thought of them, even in our sorrows which are so mightie on us; our weak spirits are readie to relinquish the possession they've of mortalitie, and take swift flight after our roial friends. Simanthes, be it your charge to see all fitting preparation provided for the funerals. Enter Selinthus. Sel. Where's great Almanzor? Abr. O Selinthus, this day is the hour of funerals grief; for his crueltie to my brother, has translated him to immortalitie. Sel. Hee'll have attendants to wait on him to our great prophets paradise, ere he be readie for his grave. The Souldiers all mad with rage for the Princes slaughter, have vow'd by all oaths Souldiers can invent, (and that's no smal store) with death and destruction to pursue sullen Mura. Abr. Tarifa, use your authoritie to keep their violence in due obedience. We're so fraught with grief, we have no room for any other passion in our distracted bosome. Take these roial bodies and place them on that couch; here where they fell, they shal be imbalm'd. Yet put them out of our sight, their veiws draw fresh drops from our heart. Anon we'l shew our selves to chear the afflicted Subject. a Shout. Omnes. Long live Abrahen, great Caliph of Arabia. Exeunt Abr. And who can say now, Abrahen is a villain? I am saluted King with acclamations that deaf the Heavens to hear, with as much joy as if I had atchiev'd this Scepter by means fair and vertuous. 'Twas this handkercher that did to death Almanzor; so infected, its least insensible vapour has full power; apply'd to th'eye, or any other Organ, can drink its poyson in to vanquish Nature, though nere so strong and youthful. 'Twas Simanthes devis'd it for my brother, and my cunning transferr'd it to Almanzor; 'tis no matter, my worst impiety is held now religious. 'Twixt Kings and their inferiors there's this ods, These are meer men, we men, yet earthly gods. Exit. Abil. 'Twas well the Muts prov'd faithful, otherwise I'd lost my breath with as much speed and silence as those who do expite in dreams, their health seeming no whit abated. But 'twas wisely consider'd of me, to prepare those sure instruments of destruction: The suspicion I had by Abrahen of my fathers fears of my unthought ambition, did instruct me by making them mine, to secure my safety. Would the inhumane Surgeon had tane these blessed lights from me; that I had liv'd for ever doom'd to perpetual darkness, rather then Tarifa's fears had so appeach'd her honour. Well, villain Brother, I have found, that by my seeming death, which by my lives best arts I ne're should have had knowledg of. Dear Father, though thou to me wert pitilesse, my heart weeps tears of blood, to see thy age thus like a lofty pine fall, eaten through by th'gin from its own Stock descending: He has agents in his ungracious wickednesse: Simanthes he has discover'd: Were they multitudes as numerous as collected sands, and mighty in force as mischief, they should from my Justice meet their due punishment. Abrahen by this is proclaim'd Caliph, yet my undoubted right, when't shall appear I'me living, wil reduce the people to my part; the armie's mine, whither I must withdraw unseen: the night wil best secure me. What a strange Chimera of thought possesses my dul brain! Caropia, thou hast a share in them: Fate, to thy mercie I do commit my self; who scapes the snare once, has a certain caution to beware. Exit. Scen. 2. Enter Caropia and Perilinda. Car. Your Lord is not returned yet! Per. No, good Madam: pray do not thus torment your self, the Prince (I warrant you) wil have no injurie by saving of your honour; do you think his father wil be so extreme outragious for such a trifle, as to force a woman with her good liking? Car. My ill boding soul beats with presages ominous. Would heaven I'd stood the hazard of my incens'd Lords furie, rather then he had run this imminent danger. Could you ne're learn, which of the slaves it was betray'd our close loves to loath'd Mura's notice? Per. No indeed could I not; but here's my Lord, pray Madam do not grieve so! Enter Mur. Mu. My Caropia, dress up thy looks in their accustom'd beauties, cal back the constant spring into thy cheeks, that droope like lovely Violets, o're charg'd with too much mornings dew; shoot from thy eies a thousand flames of joy. The lustful Prince, that like a foul thief, rob'd thee of thy honour by his ungracious violence has met his roial fathers Justice. Car. Now my fears carry too sure an augury! you would fain sooth me, my Lord, out of my floud of sorrows; what reparation can that make my honour, though he have tasted punishment? Mu. His life is faln the off-spring of thy chastitie, which his hot lust polluted: nay, Caropia, to save himself, when he but felt the torment applied to his lascivious eies; although at first he did with impudence acknowledg thy rape, he did invade thy spotless virtue, protested, only 'twas to save thy honor, he took on him thy rape, when with consent and not constrain'd, thou yeildedst to the loosness of his wild vicious flames. Car. Could he be so unjust, my Lord? Mu. He was, and he has paid for't; the malicious Souldier, while he was a losing his eies, made violent head to bring him reskue, which pul'd his ruine on him. But no more of such a prodigie; may his black memorie perish even with his ashes. My Caropia, the flourishing trees widow'd by winters violence of their fair ornaments, when 'tis expir'd once, put forth again with new and virgin freshness, their bushie beauties; it should be thy emblem. Display agen those chast immaculate glories, which the harsh winter of his lust had wither'd; and I'll agen be wedded to thy vertues, with as much joy, as when thou first inrich'd me with their pure maiden beauties. Thou art dul, and dost not gratulate with happie welcoms, the triumphs of thy vengeance. Car. Are you sure, my Lord, the Prince is dead? Mu. Pish, I beheld him breathlesse. Take comfort best Caropia, thy disgrace did with his loath'd breath vanish. Car. I could wish though, that he had falne by your particular vengance, rather then by th'laws rigor; you're a Souldier of glorie, great in war for brave performance: me thinks't had been far nobler, had you call'd him to personal satisfaction: had I been your husband, you my wife, and ravished by him; my resolution would have arm'd my courage to've stroke him thus: The dead Prince sends you that. Stab him Mu. O, I am slain! Car. Would it were possible to kil even thy eternitie. Sweet Prince, how shal I satisfie thy unhappie ruins! Ha, not yet breathlesse! To increase thy anguish even to despair, know, Abilqualit was more dear to me, then thy foul selfe was odious, and did enjoy me freely. Mu. That I had but breath enough to blast thee. Car. 'Twas his brother (curse on his art) seduc'd me to accuse him of my rape. Do you groane, prodigie! take this as my last bountie. Stab again. Enter Perilinda. Per. O Madam, Madam, what shal we do? the house is round beset with Souldiers; Madam, they do sweare they'le tear my Lord, for the sweet Princes death, in pieces. Car. This hand has sav'd their furie that just labour: yet I'le make use of their malice, help to convey him into's Chamber. Enter Osman, Gasselles, Souldiers. Gas. Where is this villain, this traitor Mura? Car. Heaven knowes what violence their furie may assault me with; be't death, 't shall be as welcome, as sound healthful sleeps to men oppress'd with sicknesse. What's the matter? what means this outrage? Os. Marry, Ladie gay, We're come to cut your little throat; pox on you, and all your sex; you've caus'd the noble Princes death, wild-fire take you fort, weel talk with you at better leisure: you must needs be ravished! and could not like an honest woman, take the curtesie in friendly sort! Gas. We trifle: her husband may escape us. Say, where is he? or you shall die, ere you can pray Sold. Here, here I have found the vallain! what, do you sleep so soundly? ne're wake more, this for the Prince, you rogue: let's tear him piecemeale. Do you take your death in silence, dog! Car. You appear indow'd with some humanitie, you have tane his life; let not your hate last after death; let me embalm his bodie with my tears, or kil me with him. Os. Now you've said the word, we care not if we do. Enter Tarifa. Tar. Slaves, unhand the Ladie, who dares offer her least violence, from this hand meets his punishment. Gaselles, Osman, I thought you had been better temper'd, then thus to raise up mutinies. In the name of Abrahen our now Caliph, I command you, desist from these rebellious practises, and quietly retire into the Camp, and there expect his pleasure. Gas. Abrahen Caliph! There is some hopes then, we shall gaine our pardons: Long live great Abrahen. Souldiers, slink away, our vow is consummate. Car. O my deare Lord! Tar. Be gone. Os. Yes, as quietly as if we were in flight before the foe; the general pardon at the coronation, wil bring us off I'me sure. Tar. Alas, good Madam! I'me sorrie that these miseries have faln with so much rigor on you; pray take comfort: your husband prosecuted with too much violence Prince Abilqualit's ruine. Car. It appeared so! what worlds of woes have hapless I given life to, and yet survive them! Tar. Do not with such furie torment your innocent self. I'me sure the Emperor Abrahen, wil number't 'mongst his greatest sorrows, that he has lost your husband. I must give him notice of these proceedings. Best peace keep you, and settle your distractions. Car. not until I'me setled in my peaceful urne. This is yet some comfort to me, 'midst the floods of woes, that do overwhelm me for the Princes death, that I reveng'd it safely; though I prize my life at no more value then a foolish ignorant Indian does a Diamond, which for a bead of Jet or glass, he changes: Nor would I keep it, were it not with fuller, more noble braverie, to take revenge for my Lord Abilqualit's timelesse slaughter. I must use craft and mysterie. Dissembling is held the natural qualitie of our Sex, nor wil't be hard to practice. This same Abrahen, that by his brothers ruine weilds the Scepter, whether out of his innocence or malice, 'twas that perswaded me to accuse him of my rape. The die is cast, I am resolv'd to thee my Abilqualit I wil come. A death for love,'s no death but Martyrdom. Exit</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Scena 1. Enter Abilqualit, Selinthus, Gasselles, Osman, Souldiers, and Muts. Abil. No more, good faithful Souldiers; thank the powers divine, has brought me back to you in safety; the traitorous practises against our life, and our deare fathers, poison'd by our brother; we have discoverd, and shall take just vengance on the unnatural paricide: Retire into your tents, and peacefully expect the event of things, you Osman and Gasselles shall into th'Citie with me. Os. We wil march through the world with thee, dear Soveraign, great Abilqualit. Abil. Selinthus, give you our dear Tarifa speedie notice we are again among the living: pray him to let our loyal Subjects in the Citie, have sure intelligence of our escape; and dearest friends and fellowes, let not your too loud expressions of your joy, for our unlook'd for welfare, subject to discoverie our unexpected safety. Sel. Never fear: they'r trustie Mirmidons, and wil stick close to you their dear Achilles; but my Lord, the wisest may imagine it were safer for you to rest here 'mong your armed legions, then to intrust your person in the City, whereas it seems by the pass'd storie, you'le not know friends from enemies. Abil. Selinthus, Thy honest care declares the zealous duty thou ow'st thy Soveraign: but what danger can assault us there, where there, is none suspects we are alive? we'l go surveigh the state of things, i'th'morning we will seize the Palace, and then proclaim our Right. Come, valiant Captains, you shall be our companions. Gas. And we'l guard you safe, as you were encompass'd with an Army. Sel. You guard your own fools heads: Is't fit his safety, on which our lives and fortunes have dependance, should be expos'd unto your single valour? Pray once let your friends rule you, that you may rule them hereafter. Your good brother Abrahen has a strong faction, it should seem i'th'Court: and those these Blood-hounds follow'd the sent hotly till they had worried Mura. He has other allies of no mean consequence; your Eunuch Mesithes his chief Favourite, and Simanthes. Abil. It was that Villain that betray'd my Love to him and slaught'red Mura. Sel. Very likely. An arranter, falser Parasite, never was cut like a Colt. Pray Sir, be wise this once, at my intreaties; and for ever after use your discretion as you please: these night works I do not like; yet e're the morning I will bring Tarifa to you. Abil. You shall o're rule us. Poor Caropia, these thoughts are thy vot'ries; love thy active fire, flames out when present, absent in desire. Exeunt. Scen. 2. Enter Abrahen, Simanthes and Mesithes. Abr. What State and Dignitie's like that of Scepters? With what an awful Majesty resembles it the Powers above? the inhabitants of that Superior world are not more subject to them, then these to us; they can but tremble when they do speak in thunder; at our frowns these shake like Lambs at lightning. Can it be impiety by any means to purchase this earthly Deity, Soveraignty. I did sleep this night with as secure and calme a peace, as in my former innocence. Conscience, thou'rt but a terror, first devis'd by th'fears of Cowardise, a sad and fond remembrance, which men should shun, as Elephants clear springs, lest they behold their own deformities, Enter Mesithes. and start at their grim shadowes. Ha, Mesithes! Mes. My Royal Lord! Abr. Call me thy Friend, Mesithes, thou equally dost share our heart, best Eunuch; there is not in the stock of earthly blessings another I could wish to make my state completely fortunate, but one; and to atcheive possession of that bliss, thy diligence must be the fortunate Instrument. Mes. Be it dangerous as the affrights Sea men do fain in Tempests, I'll undertake it for my gracious Soveraign, and perish, but effect it, Abr. No, there is not the least shew of peril in't; 'tis the want of fair Caropia's long coveted beauties that doth afflict thy Abrahen. Love, Mesithes, is a most stubborn Malady in a Lady, not cur'd with that felicity, that are other passions, and creeps upon us by those ambushes, that we perceive our selves sooner in love, then we can think upon the way of loving. The old flames break more brightly from th'ashes where they have long layn hid, like the young Phenix that from her spicie pile revives more glorious. Nor can I now extinguish't; it has pass'd the limits of my reason, and intend my wil, where like a fixt Star't settles, never to be removed thence. Mes. Cease your fears; I that could win her for your brother, who could not boast half your masculine Perfections, for you will vanquish her. Enter Simanthes. Sim. My Lord, the widow of slaughtered Mura, fair Caropia does humbly intreat access to your dread presence; Shall we permit her entrance? Abr. With all freedom and best regard. Mesithes, this arrives beyond our wish. I'll trie my eloquence in my own cause; and if I fail, thou then shalt be my Advocate. Mes. Your humblest vassal. Abr. With-draw and leave us, and give strict order none approach our presence till we do call. It is not fit her sorrows Enter Car. should be survey'd by common eie. Caropia, welcom; and would we could as easily give thee comfort as we allow thee more then mod'rate pitie. In tears those eyes cast forth a greater lustre, then sparkling rocks of Diamonds inclos'd in swelling seas of Pearl. Car. Your Majestie is pleas'd to wanton with my miseries, which truly you, if you have nature in you, ought to bear equall part in your deer brothers untimely losse, occasion'd by my falshood, and your improvident counsel: 'Tis that calls these hearty sorrows up, I am his Murdresse. Abr. 'Twas his own destinie, not our bad intentions took him away from earth; he was too heavenly, fit only for th'societie of Angels, 'mongst whom he sings glad hymns to thy perfections, celebrating with such eloquence thy beauties, that those immortal essences forget to love each other by intelligence, and doat on the Idea of thy Sweetnesse. Car. These gentle blandishments; and his innocent carriage had I as much of malice as a Tigresse rob'd of her young, would melt me into meeknesse. But I'll not be a woman. Abr. Sing out, Angel, and charm the world (were it at mortal diff'rence) to peace with thine inchantments. What soft murmurs are those that steal through those pure rosie organs, like aromatick west-winds, when they flie through fruitful mists of fragrant mornings dew, to get the Spring with child of flowers and spices? Disperse these clouds, that like the vail of night, with unbecoming darknesse shade thy beauties, and strike a new day from those orient eies, to gild the world with brightnesse. Car. Sir, these flatteries neitheir befit the ears of my true sorrows, nor yet the utt'rance of that reall sadnesse should dwel in you. Are these the fun'ral rites you pay the memorie of your roiall Father, and much lamented Brother? Abr. They were mortall, and to lament them, were to shew I envi'd th'immortal joyes of that true happinesse their glorious souls (disfranchis'd from their flesh) possess to perpetuitie and fulnesse. Besides, (Caropia) I have other griefs more neer my heart, that circle't with a sicknesse will shortly number me among their fellowship, if speedier remedie be not apply'd to my most desp'rate maladie. Car. I shall (if my hand fail not my determin'd courage) send you to their societie far sooner then you expect or covet. Why, great Sir, what grief, unlesse your sorrow for their losse, is't can afflict you, that command all blessings men wittie in ambition of excesse can wish, to please their fancies? Abr. The want only of that which I've so long desird; thy love, thy love, Caropia, without which my Empire, and all the pleasures flowing from its greatnesse, wil be but burdens, soul-tormenting troubles. There's not a beam shot from those grief drown'd Comets but (like the Sun's, when they break forth of showers) dart flames more hot and piercing. Had I never doated before on thy divine perfections, viewing thy beautie thus adorn'd by sadnesse, my heart, though marble, actuated to softnesse, would burn like sacred incense, it self being the Altar, Priest, and Sacrifice. Car. This is as unexpected, as unwelcome, Sir. Howere you're pleas'd to mock me and my griefs with these impertinent, unmeant discourses, I cannot have so prodigal a faith, to give them the least credit; and it is unkindly done, thus to deride my sorrows. the virgin Turtles hate to joyn their pureness with widow'd mates; my Lord, you are a Prince, and such as much detest to utter falshoods, as Saints do perjuries: why should you strive then to lay a bait to captivate my affections, when your greatnesse conjoin'd with your youths masculine beauties, are to a womans frailtie, strong temptations? You know the storie too of my misfortunes, that your dead brother, did with vicious loosenesse, corrupt the chast streams of my spotlesse vertues, and left me soiled like a long pluck'd rose, whose leaves dissever'd, have forgon their sweetnesse. Abr. Thou hast not (my Caropia;) thou to me art for thy sent stil fragrant, and as precious as the prime virgins of the Spring, the violets, when they do first display their early beauties, til all the winds in love, do grow contentious, which from their lips should ravish the first kisses. Caropia, thinkst thou I should fear the Nuptials of this great Empire, 'cause it was my brothers? As I succeeded him in all his glories, 'tis fit I do succeed him in his love. 'Tis true, I know thy fame fel by his practise, which had he liv'd, hee'd have restored by marriage, by it repair'd thy injur'd honors ruines. I'me bound to do it in religious conscience; It is a debt his incens'd ghost would quarrel me living for, should I not pay't with fulnesse. Car. Of what frail temper is a womans weaknesse! words writ in waters, have more lasting Essence, then our determinations. Abr. Come, I know, thou must be gentle, I perceive a combat in thy soft heart, by th'intervening blushes that strive to adorn thy cheek with purple beauties, and drive the lovely liverie of thy sorrows, the Ivorie paleness, out of them. Think, Caropia, with what a setled unrevolting truth I have affected thee; with what heat, what pureness; and when upon mature considerations, I found I was unworthie to enjoy a treasure of such excellent grace and goodnesse, I did desist, smothering my love in anguish; anguish! to which the soul of humane torments, compar'd, were pains not easie, but delicious; yet stil the secret flames of my affections, like hidden virtues in some bashful man, grew great and ferventer by those suppressions. Thou wert created only for an Empresse; despise not then thy destinie, now greatnesse, love, Empire, and what ere may be held glorious, courts thy acceptance like obedient Vassals. Car. I have consider'd, and my serious thoughts tel me, tis folly to refuse these profers: to put off my mortalitie, the pleasures of life, which like ful streams, do flow from greatnesse, to wander i'th'unpeopled air, to keep societie with ghastly apparitions, where's neither voice of friends, nor visiting suitors breaths to delight our ears, and all this for the fame of a fell murdress. I have blood enough alreadie on my soul, more then my tears can e're wash off. My roial Lord, if you can be so merciful and gracious, to take a woman laden with afflictions, big with true sorrow, and religious penitence for her amiss, her life and after actions, shal studie to deserve your love. But surely this is not serious. Abr. Not the vowes which votries make to the powers above, can be more fraught with binding sanctitie. This holy kiss confirms our mutual vows: never til now was I true Caliph of Arabia. Enter, Enter, Enter, Abr. Ha, what tumult's that! Be you all furies, and thou the great'st of divels, Abrahen wil stand you all, unmov'd as mountains This good sword if you be air, shal disinchant you from your borrow'd figures. Abil. No, ill-natur'd monster, we're all corporeal, and survive to take revenge on thy inhumane acts, at name of which, the bashful elements do shake as if they teem'd with prodigies. Dost not tremble at thy inhumane villaines? Dear Caropia, quit the infectious viper, lest his touch poison thee past recoverie. Abr. No, she shall not; nor you, until this body be one wound. Lay a rude hand upon me! Abilqualit, how ere thou scapst my practises with life, I am not now to question; we were both sons to one father, whom, for love of Empire, when I beleev'd thee strangled by those Muts, I sent to his eternal rest; nor do I repent the fact yet, I have been titled Caliph a day, which is to my ambitious thoughts, honor enough to eternize my big name to all posteritie. I know thou art of valiant noble soul; let not thy brother fal by ignoble hands, oppress'd by number; draw thy bright weapon; as thou art in Empire, thou art my rival in this Ladies love, whom I esteem above all joyes of life: for her and for this Monarchie, let's trie our strengths and fates: the impartial fates to him, who has the better cause, in justice must needs design the victorie. Abil. In this offer, though it proceed from desperatenesse, not valor; thou showst a masculine courage, and we wil not render our cause so abject as to doubt, but our just arme has strength to punish thy most unheard of treacheries. Tar. But you shall not be so unjust to us and to your right, to try your causes most undoubted Justice, 'gainst the dispairing ruffian; Souldiers, pul the Lady from him, and disarm him. Abil. Stay! though he doth merit multitudes of death, we would not murder his eternitie by sudden execution; yeild your self, and we'l allow you libertie of life, til by repentance you have purg'd your sin; and so if possible, redeem your soul from future punishment. Abr. Pish, tel fools of souls, and those effeminate cowards that do dreame of those fantastick other worlds: there is not such a thing in nature; all the soul of man is resolution, which expires never from valiant men, till their last breath, and then with it like to a flame extinguisht'd for want of matter, 't dos not dy, but rather ceases to live. Injoy in peace your Empire, and as a legacy of Abrahens love, take this fair Lady to your Bride. stab her. Abil. Inhumane Butcher! has slain the Lady. Look up, best Caropia, run for our surgeons: I'le give half my Empire to save her precious life. Abr. She has enough, or mine aym fail'd me, to procure her passage to the eternal dwellings: nor is this cruelty in me; I alone was worthy to have injoy'd her beauties. Make good haste Caropia, or my soul, if I have any, will hover for thee in the clouds. This was the fatal engine which betray'd our father to his untimely death, made by Simanthes for your use, Abilqualit: and who has this about him and would be a slave to your base mercy, deserved death more than by dayly tortures; and thus I kiss'd my last breath. Blast you all. dies. Tar. Damn'd desperate villain. Abil. O my dear Caropia, my Empire now will be unpleasing to me since I must lose thy company. This surgeon, where's this surgeon? Sel. Drunk perhaps. Car. 'Tis but needlesse, no humane help can save me: yet me thinks I feel a kind of pleasing ease in your imbraces. I should utter something, and I have strength enough, I hope, lest yet to effect my purpose. In revenge for your suppos'd death, my lov'd Lord, I slew my husband, Abil. I'me sorry thou hast that sin to charge thy soul with, 'twas rumour'd by the souldiers. Sel. Couzens mine, your necks are safe agen now. Car. And came hither with an intent to have for your sake slain your brother Abrahen, had not his curtesie and winning carriage alter'd my resolution, with this poniard I'de struck him here about the heart. Stabs Abil. Abil. O I am slain, Caropia, and by thy hand. Heavens, you are just, this is revenge for thy dear honor which I murdred, though thou wer't consenting to it. Car. True, I was so, and not repent it yet, my sole ambition was to have liv'd an Empresse, which since fate would not allow, I was resolv'd no woman after my selfe should ere injoy that glory, you dear Abilqualit: which since my weak strength has serv'd me to performe, I dye willingly as an infant. O now I faint, life's death to those that keep it by constraint. dye. Tar. My dear Lord, is there no hopes of life? must we be wretched? Abil. Happier, my Tarifa, by my death: but yesterday I playd the part in jest which I now act in earnest. My Tarifa, the Empire's thine, I'me sure thou'lt rul't with justice, and make the subject happy. Thou hast a Son of hopefull growing vertues to succeed thee, commend me to him, and from me intreat him to shun the temptings of lascivious glances. Sel. 'Las good Prince! heele dy indeed. I fear, he is so full of serious thoughts and Counsels. Abil. For this slaughtred body, let it have decent burial with slain Muras, but let not Abrahens corps have so much honor to come ith'royal monument: lay mine by my dear fathers: for that trecherous Eunuch, and Lord Simanthes, use them as thy justice tells thee they have merited; for Lord Selinthus, advance him (my Tarifa) hee's of faithfull and well deserving vertues. Sel: So I am, I thought t'would come to me anon: poor Prince, I e'ne could dy with him. Abil. And for those souldiers, and those our most faithfull Muts, that my life once sav'd, let them be well rewarded; death and I are almost now at unitie. Farewell. dyes. Tar. Sure I shall not survive these sorrows long. Muts, take those Traitors to prison; we will shortly passe their sentence, which shall be death inevitable. Take up that fatal instrument of poisonous mischief, and see it burn'd, Gaselles. Gentlemen, Fate has made us your King against our wishes. Sel. Long live Tarifa, Caliph of Arabia. Tar. We have no time now for your acclamations; these are black sorrows Festival. Bear off in state that royal Bodie; for the other, since twas his will, let them have burial, but in obscuritie. By this it may, as by an ev'dent rule be understood, they're onely truly great, wh'are truly good. Exeunt omnes. Recorders Flourish. FINIS.</field>
