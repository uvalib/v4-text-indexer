      <field name="fulltext">THE TRAGEDY OF King Richard the First.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS GRACE THE Duke of Newcastle.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Enter Mauro and Solyman, two Saracens. Mauro. Thro' what a Tract of vast unmeasur'd Space, These Christian Chiefs have led their wand'ring Host; Their Sails have courted every Wind that blows, And wanton'd in variety of Seas. Calpe beheld them pass his rocky Height, Frown'd on their burden'd Ships with length of Shade, While they, undaunted, cut their watry Way, And, smiling, cast back Fear upon his Brow. In vain the Mountains rise, the Rivers swell, They mock the Whirlpool, fighting, Ford the Stream, And, clogg'd in cumbrous Armour, climb the steep. Solyman. Such Praise, unblushing, we may give our Foes, A Soldier's Honour brightens by the Blaze Of neighbouring Virtue, and reflects new Light. Mauro. But yet, methinks, 'tis wond'rous strange Success Should wait as Servant to their moving Camp, And hail them still victoriousâSee they bring Monarchs enchained, rude Ravishments of War, Bidding Captivity new Conquests make, And stretch the Line of Bondage by the Hands Of Princely Vassals, and of Royal Slaves. Solyman. And what the Recompence of all their Toil, Slowly to gain what never can be kept, For distant Conquests are like needy Friends In Climes remote, who still dissemble Wants 'Till Wealth amass'd, Temptation glitt'ring nigh, The Gift of Power too strong for Honour proves, And makes the fair Possession all its own. O! were their Arms and Policy alike! Mauro. Their Arms! I scorn their Armsâ Solyman. Have you forgot By whose high Hand fair Ptolemais sunk, Whose single Valour forced the guarded Trench, And let in swift Destruction at his Heels. Who, like a Whirlwind rais'd by Magic-Art, Shook all her Tow'rs and Battlements to Earth; And left our frighted Deities to mourn Their prostrate Temples, and their widow'd Shrines. Was any City of the peopled Earth, Tho' built in Fable, and by hireling Gods, So proudly strong, and yet so fairly won? Mauro. Why wouldst thou open that sad Scene of Slaughter, And set victorious Richard in my View? More dreadful than their bold confed'rate Kings, Whene'er the Austrian Eagle droops his Wings; Or the French Lillies sicken at the War, He plants his English Lions in the Breach; Snatches the new-gain'd Conquest from our Hand, And robs both Friend and Enemies of Fame. I saw him, when, with manly Force, he sway'd, Dire Instrument, the two-edg'd Battle-Axe, Whose Weight requir'd a Giant's Arm to poise, But he shook easy as a bending Reed, Death follow'd close, and mark'd his Way with Blood. What Thousands then had fell, had not his Eye Cast on an Infant Train, bad Slaughter cease, CeaseâCeaseâhe cry'dâThese may be Christians yetâ Solyman. That Grace they owe to Berengaria's Lips, (For so the Brother of the Scottish King, Young David, Envoy once of happy Truce) Has often told to our admiring Court. He spoke the Dove-like Meekness of her Eye, The sweet Perswasion of her soften'd Look, Whene'er her Hero march'd, she, sighing, cry'd, O spare the Mother for the Infant's sake! O spare the Infant for the Mother's sake! Mauro. What End of Warring with so brave a Foe? Solyman. I know not yet, but hourly we expect, Achmet's Return, the favourite Renegade, Who went a Spy upon the Christian Camp. Mauro. I hate that saucy Convert to our Faith! 'Tis true, he's brave, but hangs his Merit high, To catch the View of popular Regard; To us his Equals insolently vain, But to the Sultan fawning as a Slave, As damn'd a Whisperer in his Prince's Ear. As Eastern Eunuchs, or a Christian Priest. And he, this Sycophant, this talking Warriour, Must hate Armida too, the warlike Maid, Whose valiant Deeds as far o'ermates his Worth, As Richard's mineâ Solyman. Mauro, compose thy Wrath, It ill becomes us when the Iron Hand Of War is waving o'er our City Gates, Threatning to fall and crush us to the Earth, To spend that Rage, that might prevent our Fate In civil Broils and Factions with our Friends. Enter a Captain. Captain. My Lords, the Princes, Counsellors, and Chiefs Of all our Host are now in Counsel met, Great Saladine himself is seated on the Throne, And here's Prince Achmet from the Christian Camp. [Exit. Solyman. We come. Mauro. He said, Prince Achmet, did he not? Now, by our Prophet, where do Titles grow? Or does bright Honour, like Dame Fortune reign, And blindfold fling her Largesses on Earth, While ev'ry Chance-Receiver wears as high The flutt'ring Gift, as if his own by Right, And from a Villain grows into a Prince; A Prince, a Spy, an Office for a Dog, That lurks and beats about the Field to spring his Game. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter Saladine, Achmet, Solyman, Mauro, &amp;c. Saladine. Lords, Princes, Brother-Soldiers of the Field, Whose Valour long has held our Scepter fast, Tho' often shaken by the Wind of War, And rushing Tempests of confed'rate Kings. Mauro. For this the West and Southern Standards join, For this the proud imperial Eagle stoops Patient of Friendship by the Lillies Side, The Northern Lion wont at home to range, Now loosen'd and enlarg'd by Richard's Arm In Jewry roars, and shakes the Eastern Skies. Him most, him first of these confed'rate Kings Our Armies dread, and tremble to behold. While strong of Arm he shakes the well-pois'd Spear, Fear flies and warns the Nations to retire, Death wings the Shaft from his unerring Bow. But, when provok'd to near Approach, he wields The two-edg'd Battle-Axe with forceful Sway; Heaps fall on Heaps, Destruction sits and smiles O'er the mix'd Carnage, till his fatal Hand From Hill to Hill th'unsated Vulture drives. Saladine. Mean Time, what Number of our Slaves remain? 'Tis fit we show the Price of Christian Blood, By pouring it, like Water, on the Earth. Achmet. We count six hundred Slaves of either Sex. Saladine. Count them no more, but as a Number perish'dâ They shall be try'dâThey boast of wond'rous Faith, That mocks Destruction, and embraces Death Like a fond Mistress, or far-sought Friend. Achmet, the Charge be yours to see their Deaths, And tell how many of these glorious Saints Rejoice in Misery, and smile in Flames. Achmet. Torture shall prove ingenious in their Woes, Some groan on Earth beneath the pointed Wood With upward Cry to Heaven, who will not hear The bloody Sword shall parcel piecemeal Death, Limb follow Limb, and last of all the Eye, When it has wept its Fellow-Organs, drop The last sad Tear suck'd up by burning Brands. Mauro. How bloody are these Converts in their Rage! I'ad rather trust a hungry Lioness, With all my Children, than a new-made Convert. Achmet. Curse on that Richard. Saladine. Curse him not, He is a King; and in that awful Name, Wherever nam'd, attendant Strength and Power Call for the ready Debt of fairest Speech, Of favourite Wishes, and the Tongue of Blessing. Let Guilt that fears the Shadow of a Spy, Curse Kings at Midnight when the Moon is sick; Let damn'd Rebellion, hid in cavern'd Rocks, Gnawing her fretful Form to Blisters, send To roaring Seas her idle Imprecations. Tho' he were more my Foe than Richard is, I would not curse the Man I must admire. SCENE III. Enter Armida, the Warlike Maid; with Erminia, Sister to Achmet, and Mistress to Saladine. Erminia. Forgive me if I plead the Sex's Cause, As willing to recover what we lost, And by one Question all my Scruples ease; How does thy Eye regard the Tyrant Man, Has no one Form more exquisitely fram'd, Call'd thee to gaze with Wonder or Delight? Armida. Just as on other Objects of my Sense, The tallest Oak or Cedar of the Grove, The well-turn'd Statue, or the breathing Paint. But yet if any of the Sex I prize, 'Tis he who scatters Death the widest round, And makes most Havock of his worthless Race. Erminia. These cruel Words convince a wounded Heart, That Love has enter'd at the Gate of Scorn. [Aside. Armida. Yet I would knowâHow was it with thy Heart, When first it leant and listen'd to thy Lord? Erminia. O Saladine! the DayâRemembrance keep the Day, In the full Height of painful Extacy! That Day, when long sollicited to hear, The thousand times unfinish'd Tale of Love. Armida. Why this Suspence! this Prologue to thy Fault? Erminia. Since 'tis ungratefulâ Armida. No!âHeaven that it were! [Aside. Erminia. Then, some God had dress'd him out for wonder then, My King approach'd, but with such soft'ned Looks, A Mind so full, so fearful of Offence, That Cruelty now chid it self, and Pride, Which keeps the outward Fences of the Heart Like an o'er-watch'd Centinel, retiring, slept. He touch'd my Hand, and Fire was in the Touch; He look'd, and spoke, and Joy was in his Speech. My Blushes rose and fell like doubtful Winds, That toss the Bosom of a wanton Sea. He saw Confusion, and pursu'd his Charge, Till Fears, like routed Armies in their Flight, Soon beat, resign'd to his victorious Love. Armida. The Conquest made, how felt the new-found Yoke? Erminia. Easy as silken Chains on captive Birds, Who love to feed-from the beloved Hand, And, hov'ring round the fair Bestower, sing Their new Captivity in sweeter Tunes. Armida. Alas! it may be! yes! it must be so! Happy Arminia!â Erminia. Not Armida too! Armida. 'Tis not in Fate to call the Minutes back That might have made meâWhat I must not be. Severe Necessity! Mysterious Love! At once a Prodigal and Bankrupt too. Erminia. How, how, Armida, I conjure thee tellâ For, ah! I see thy Blood return and go, Like a sad Messenger, to ev'ry Part, Threat'ning to speak, but starting at the Tale Of its own WoeâTellâby our Friendship tellâ Armida. Think not this Garb of War is Nature's Choice, Fate and Revenge have forc'd it on my Arms, For, O! four Suns have run their annual Course Since passing thro' the Woods of Palestine, Attended slightly by a Maiden Guard, A Troop of RobbersâThey were Christians too, I can no moreâ Erminia. They could not force thee sure! Armida. Their Captainâ Erminia. Where slept the Thunder then, Who hid the Light'ning in its secret Cave? How were the Hands of Providence employ'd, Painting new Goats and Rams arm'd in the Sky, To shed the guilty, Influence here below, And justify the Monsters of the Earth? Armida. Since thenâI swore an Enmity to Manâ Erminia. And here I swear it too, till Vengeance comes, O Traytor!âHide him not concealing Earth, Ye Rocks and Caverns shut your stony Mouths When he would enter, let no guilty Shade Afford him Place of Rest, but Darkness fly As frighted when he comesâHeavens! is it right That other Beings shall, by Instinct, trace The secret Robber, and revenge the Guilt; While favourite Man, With Wit and puzzling Reason for his Guide, Sits down and weeps his Injuries unredress'dâ Not half so privileg'd as the Dogs he feeds. Armida. Yet more remains, the Vow I made is broke, Man triumphs still, the Theft of Violence Is follow'd by the willing Gift of Love. Erminia. Achmet, or Mauro, sayâ Armida. Both Objects of my Hateâ A stranger Prince has stole my Heart away, Daily in Arms I seek the Life I loveâ Have I not said too much? Erminia. Thy Queen securesâ The secret her'sâHast thou entrusted me With Images of Darkness and Despair, The tempting Themes of our loquacious Sexâ And wilt thou hide the friendly Beam of Light, That helps me to conduct thee to thy Safety. Armida. The Scottish PrinceâYou saw him in her Court, And who beheld himâBut yet wish'd them there? Erminia. He seem'd indeed the Wonder of his Sex. Armida. O He is all Perfection! every Limb Calls upon Nature to avow her Work; Had Fortune cloath'd him in her dirty Weeds, And drest him in the Habit of Disgrace, His Air, his Action would have spoke the Prince, But as he wasâMethinks I see him now, In mock of us to lead the sprightly Ball, While Motion chides the ling'ring Instrument, While Harmony pursues him as he bounds, Steps, as he steps, and measures out the Dance. Erminia. Tho' I hold David as our mortal Foe, Foe to our Country's Altars, and our Faith.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Enter King Richard, King Philip of France, and David, Prince of Scotland. Richard. Brother of France, Dissensions have too long Wasted the Strength of our confed'rate Arms, The doubtful Soldier knows not who shall lead, And when the Trumpet calls, with jealous Ear, Suspended stands, and muses at the Sound, Which us'd to waken Honour in his Soul, And flush his Eyes with Earnest of Success. The Foe observes us, and beholds with Joy, How on our selves we take unjust Revenge. O! be it never said, two mighty Kings, Zealous of Virtue, Fame, Religion, Faith, Drain'd half their Nations, bought their People's Lives, To sell them cheaply in a foreign Land, And bid them fall and perish for their Sport. Esteem we higher of our Fellow-Beings, Not one of whom but claims our common Sire. Think well for whom we fightâand well agreeâ âCan we bid the Dew Hang high in Air, nor touch the Subject's Head, But only fall on Kings?âIf gen'ral Blessings then Are theirs as free as ours, then Rights are theirs To make those Blessings certain to them all. Philip. This Tale of Duty might become a Priest, But passes by me like the idle Wind, Since injur'd Honour and repeated Wrongs Have deaf'ned Philip's Earâ Richard. What Wrongs? Speak, Prince, Point out the Man, and tho' he stand behind The Shields of Legions, and a Wall of Brass, This Arm shall reach him, drag him to thy Feet, Trembling to look on Majesty incens'd. Philip. That Man is Richard, England's mighty King, He who leads Armies in the Cause of Heaven, Who on his Banners waves the bloody Cross, Dreadful as Light'ning to the faithless Eye, Yet can sustain to wrong a King, a Friend! Richard. Now by St. George, the Patron of my Arms, Had such a Speech escap'd another Tongue, The forward Censurer had spoke no more. Philip. But France, unaw'd, avows it with a Frown. Richard. Hah! dost thou threaten limitary Prince? Frown on thy Vassals, thy Provincial Lords, Let Burgundy be mute when Philip frowns, Or terrify thy Neighbour of Navarre, But England's King, Imperial, singly Great, Ne'er borrows Fear from France, but sends it forth To shake that Continent where he resides, And, frowning, look all Europe into Peace. Philip. What are the Arms, the Courage which you boast! Where grew it first, but in its native Gaul? 'Tis but a Graft upon a foreign Stock, A Norman-Cyon fix'd on English Ground. Richard. It loves the Climate then, and thrives apace; Honour mistook her Seat awhile, till lodg'd On Gaul's Extremities, the Isle oppos'd, Lur'd her bright Eye to wing the watry Way, And fix her constant Habitation there. Behold young David, born in Scotia's Frost, How does the blooming Hero lead to Fight? How heaves his Bosom to the Trumpet's Sound, Beating the March of Victory within? David. Rather be David's Deeds unprais'd, his Name Unheard, unknown, than see two Christian Kings, Partners of War, in vain Debate contend: The Wrongs unmention'd, yet the War at height; O! how does Rage mislead the noblest Minds! Richard. Well urg'd, brave YouthâAnd may thy just Rebuke, Lead France unpassion'd to discharge his Mind. Philip. My Sister, by thy Father's Choice, to thee betroth'd, You left deserted, and abus'd his Will. Richard. What Sire can bind Affections of the Soul, Force free-choic'd Love to Arbitrary Will? He scorns the Bondage, struggling, quits the Snare, Nor Charms, nor Duty can recal his Flight. Had I thy Sister wedded by that Tie, What Issue thence but false dissembled Love, Watchful of all Occasions to revolt; Thence fierce Debates, strong Jealousies and Cares, Children unlike, and propagated Curses. Besides, that Claim was quitted e'er we lead To Jewry's hallow'd Plains, thou knowst it, France, And not without Suspicionâ This is the Genius of thy Soil, O France! In War a cunning and intrigueing Foe, In Peace a doubtful and uncertain Friend. SCENE, A Prospect of Jerusalem. Enter King Richard and the Queen. Richard. Hail! holy City, hail! sacred-built Walls! The Joy, the Pride, the Glory of the Earth, Selected Portion of the Sons of God! Thee promis'd Blessing, Type of other Worlds, Fram'd by immortal Hands, the dying Seer, And Patriarch oft in Visions rapt beheld, Gaz'd on thy unbuilt Roofs, and saw thy Gems; Thy polish'd Gems, tho' hid in Ophir's Mines, Yet bright and blazing to the Eye of Faith. And is it given to these unhallow'd Eyes To view thy Seats, the Wish, the Vow, the Prayer Of Men, of Heroes, and of sleeping Saints? Bend, O my Soul, in Veneration bend, Kiss, kiss, in Thought the Ground, embrace The holy Tow'rs where crowding Angels hung. But, ah! they long are vanish'd from thy Choirs! Fall'n are thy Temples, and thy Glories lost! How sitt'st thou now, fair City, in the Dust, All pale and comfortless in Sorrow's Shade, Like a sad Widow, weeping for thy Sons? What Heart of Steel, what ruthless Son of War, Tho' thy sworn Foe, tho' Saladine himself, But wouldâ And warm thy Ashes with a silent Tear. O Jerusalem!â Berengaria. Now I repent not of the toilsome Way, The painful Land-march, and the Sea-sick Couch, Since I have seen the Longing of my Eyes, Thee Zion fairest of ten thousand Hills, Thee blest and haunted by immortal Guests. But, O! my Lord, my gracious Soveraign, think What captive Millions, Brothers of our Faith, In Sorrow eat the Bread of Servitude, Complaining tread the Honey-dropping Vale, And pass the Sweets of Hermon unenjoy'd. Richard. Daughter of Mercy, perfect Draught of Heaven, Fair Berengaria rest thy troubled Thought, Thy Richard Arms to loose the fetter'd Hand, To bid Dejection raise its humble Eye, That por'd to Earth to find the Grave of Care, And lift it up in Thankfulness on high. Ye Sons of Sorrow, all your Tears are mine I count them hereâTo give them to your Foes In the full Measure of exactest Vengeance. Berengaria. Ah! how polluted are the Martyr's Graves, The holy Reliques of departed Saints, Mix'd with foul Ashes, and dishonour'd Dust; How do their hov'ring Shades in dead of Night, With Voices destin'd for celestial Choirs, Sigh on their broken Urns, and Tombs profan'd? Richard. Think not that Care disturbs the silent Dead, Or that the loosen'd Ghost with nightly Watch Is pain'd for Atoms of disorder'd Clay. The Priests, good holy Market-Men, may tell Of bleeding Statues, and lamenting Shrines, Sell the forg'd DropsâAnd long as Priests can lye, Folly and Female Ignorance will believe. Berengaria. Forgive the pious Error of my Thought. Richard. Indeed, my Queen, a nobler Purpose brings Thy Richard hereâThe Cause of Heav'n is mine, I stand its Substitute to spread true Faith, To scourge the black Imposture back to Hell, And re-instate Religion on her Throne. The following Scene is, supposed, between Armida and Prince David of Scotland. Prince. What Seraph wand'ring from his heavenly Bower, Has chose this shining Vehicle of Flesh To soften heavenly Beauty to the Sight, And blunt the Rays that Nature could not bear? Or art thou rather some familiar Saint, Veiling thy Glories in this mortal Shrine? O speak!âThat I may wonderâAnd adore. Lady. Nor Saint, nor Seraph I, but human born; Who ask no Worship, but refuse the Gift Of Idol Praises, and misguided Zeal, Tho' a Priest's Tongue should gloss the pleasing Lye. Prince. [Aside. Hah! 'tis a Woman!âBut excelling all That Truth and Fable heap upon the Sex. Give me a Tyrant's Power, and Giant's Force; With all the Passion of all Lust deceas'd; And some bold DÃ¦mon mix their Spirits high, That I may rush and seize the tempting Ray. Lady. You tremble, Sir! Prince. The Thunder of the War has broke the Sky, While Clamour, roaring with a thousand Tongues, Ruffles the gentle Wing of Contemplation, And hunts her from the sweet Abode of Peace. Lady. Say, sad Inhabitant, of this forlornâ Who? And thy Office? For no common Air, Thy Aspect showâ Prince. Why? Nature's Friend, Who mark the sweet Progression of her Work, Rise with the Day-spring up, and rising draw The dewy Fragrance of the Morning's Breath. Who read the living Fires that roul on high, And note the starry Jelly as it falls. Lady. And has this Solitude such wond'rous Charms? Prince. As many more as Thought can multiply, When at the streaking down the Mind goes forth, Sees nothing round her but this beauteous Scene, One solid Region of extended Truth. Nought offers to the View that can molest The growing Freedom of the mounting Soul; Nor Thought of Sire, or Child; or dearer Wife, Dutiful Shadows of Domestic Sweets, For ruthless Sorrow cannot enter here, So sacred and so hallow'd is the Place. Lady. What are Alliances of human Life, But as they run in Virtue's clearest Stream? A Stranger is my Father if he's brave, My Father is a Stranger if he's ill. King Richard, attended by one of his Lords, after he was wounded. King. I thank thee Heaven, this Wound indeed is precious, And well becomes a Soldier in thy Cause. The blushing Token will remind my Eyes Whose Badge I wear, and ev'ry Drop I bleed, Bleeds Death to HundredsâYou my Friends, If I forget this Courtesy of War, Speak loudly that you saw your bleeding King Trailing a wounded Body to his Tent, Nodding and reelingâSay you saw him fall On the low Earth, and gnaw the Ground in Shameâ Lord. Your Highness needs no Monitor for Fameâ But now it more imports a Subject's Love To speak your Danger, and prevent our Fate; For we all die in Richard, and our Fame, That should live after, dies before us too. The poison'd Arrow may be dipt in Deathâ And thenâ Richard. What then?â Think'st thou I fear to die, acommon Fate, A general Doom? That's Argument to me To dread it not, and justify my God. For were there some exempt, and some to die, All of the Species of this human Race, 'Twere worse for Mortals than it can be now. Could we, as from a Hill, behold a Chain Of Fellow-Beings; pressing to a Gulf, Pushing each other in the Road of Death; Now singly fall, then tumble Heaps on Heaps, These come to live and be, those pass and be no more. Were such a Prospect ours! How would compassionating Nature wake In Vows, in Prayers, in agonizing Cries, âThat my Father, that my dearest Child, âMy FriendâMy WifeâO wretched Immortality!</field>
