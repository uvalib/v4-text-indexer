CAIUS LUCIUS, General of the Romans. CLODIO, Lieutenant-General. QUEEN, Wife of Cymbeline. IMOGEN, Daughter of Cymbeline. PRIESTESS in the Temple of Andate.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Palace. The Queen and Archimnestor. Queen. This wayâapartâ Here, take this golden earnest of my favour. I know that thou art skill'd, from cause to consequence, Through nature's longest chainâWhere are the drugs? Arch. They are of dread importâThink, royal mistress, Death and the fates are theirs. They send of errands That cannot be recall'd; to worlds remote, Of which we know not. Whom they are to sendâ Queen. Befits not thee to askâsuppose a rat, Or somewhat noblerâHeaven, without compunction, Kills thousands by the hourâThe best must fall; The manner matters not.âThese juleps, come, Instruct me in their virtues. Arch. This falls on nature like a depth of snow, Unfelt, though weightyâsilent as a thief By night, it steals the mental treasures forth, And leaves the house asleepâThis smiles; but holds, In every drop, a death; in every death, A thousand racks, impalements, all the pangs That science yet hath learn'd, by fire or cord, To wring from nature. Queen. It is enoughâRetire. [Exit Archimnestor. Empire is now our own, while thus, like fate, We deal out death to all, who would oppose The greatness of our purpose. SCENE II. Cloten enters. Clot. O mother, she is goneâshe's lost for ever!â Queen. What means my son? Clot. My love, my Imogen, Britain's bright heir, my promised wife, is lost, Is married to anotherâto the wretch I most detest, That foundling, that accursed Leonatus! O, she is gone, and with her too is gone All prospect of the throne! Queen. Not so, my childâ A froward foolish girl, she's well away! Whine for a wench?âmy boy shall have a thousand. Be secret and secure; for here I vow, Ere yet our horned moon shall fill her orb, To seat thee, scepter'd, on the throne of Britain. They comeâBe patient, and rely on me. SCENE III. Enter King, Imogen, Lords and Attendants. Cymb. Give me room, gods!âWhat, hereâwithin my palace!â Wived, wedded, coupled to a dogâour daughter! Such a broad act!â'tis worse than to offend Within the very aim of Heaven's hot bolt, When launch'd to crush transgression. Imog. O, my father! [Kneels. Cymb. Our daughter, art thou?âBritain's only hope, Sole heir of our dominions?âGodsâO gods!â So match'd, so pair'd!âthe offspring of our throne Cast on a dunghillâmarried to a wretch, Whose hopes are less than air; whose whole possession Shrinks from a grasp; who wants a name to tell He sprung from human race!â A foundling-villain; one composed of scraps, A poverty of manhood! Imog. O, sirâmy royal master!â Cymb. What, confess it?â Out, thou vile stain, thou foulness of thy race!â Thus let me scour the blot. [Offers to kill her. Queen. Forbid it, Heaven!â [Interposes. Gentle, my lord! the princess, as you see, Is all submission; mourns, and weeps, and prays, And only waits to know your royal will, Whereby to square the line of her obedience. [Imogen rises. Imog. No, madam! let him strikeâhe is my king; He is my father too. He would have yoked me To that same son of yours!âMy life is his, But not my truth; my death he may command, But not my prostitution. Cymb. Degenerate girl, who wouldst have fill'd our throne With beggary and baseness!â Imog. No, my lordâ With goodness and with glory; with a man, Who, that he is a man, is the best praise And pride of human kind! I would have given, Grace to your crown, protection to your age, Truth to your trust, and conquest to your armies. Cymb. Poison and poniards, ratherâOut upon thee!â A specious, popular, and secret traitor! Fond, foolish wench, he prizes not thy love, But as thou art the step to his ambition. Now, by the powers I hold from earth and Heaven, As father and as king, I do divorce thee From all affiance with that foundling slave, That hated Leonatus!âCome, thy handâ Here, Cloten, take her to theeâ Imog. Hence, low wretch!â Exchange an eagle for an owlet!âNo. Cymb. Hear me, thou rebel!âI had once a sister, Fair to all eyes, and dear to every heart: Like thee, she proved incontinent; nor sought Our will in wedlockâTo the laws I gave her: At the dread shrine of our avenging Goddess, I saw her blood let forthâI saw the flames Ascend her pyre, and in one blaze involve Her and her unborn babe. Imog. O tale of woe!â O barbarous brother! Cymb. Hear meâWhat withholds, But that I yield thee, also, to the claims Of steel and fire? Imog. Thrice welcome, fire and steelâ So that my sufferings might atone the sins Of my dread sire. Cymb. Mark, lords; and you, my subjectsâ This traitress, this young parricide, who would Untimely push her father from his throne, And, with her paramour, usurp dominion; Henceforth, an alien to our blood and crown, We cast her offâand, in her room, adopt This son of our fair Queen, the princely Cloten. With love and fealty, alone, we claim All future kindredâsuch, alone, shall heir Our heart and empire! I will hear no pleadingsâ Follow me all, and leave her to her fortunes. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. To Imogen Leonatus. They run and embrace. Imog. My lord, my every love, my Leonatusâ Thou world of Imogen, who dost comprize Whatever nature, in her various round, Can cull of goodâthou fullness of my soul, At once the source, and the satiety, Of all my wishes!â O, we must severâwe must part, my love, As in the last vain gaspings after life, When soul and body sunder! Leon. O bower of bliss, on whom eternal spring Hath lavish'd all its fragrance, sayst thou, part?â To part with thee, in life or death, were worse Than all the gather'd heap of mortal ills, That life or death can threaten. Imog. All is overâ All is discover'd, sweet, and we must part! If Heaven has joy, within the seeds of time, For truth, and faith, and infinite endearment, Then we must meet again!âAway, awayâ Even while I, thus, would cling to thee for ever, My fears, that one look more may prove our last, Turn me to frenzy!âWhile we talk, the storm Comes on apace; and, ere one fond adieu, May break upon thy head! Leon. Let us haste, then, And, glutton-like, at one short meal, devour Our hoard of promis'd blissâCome to my arms!â O thus, for ever thus, that I might hold theeâ Wrap thy existence inward to my soul, Even as the clasping rind contains and folds The fragrance of the cedar! SCENE V. Enter King, Queen, Cloten, Lords, Guards, Attendants. Cymb. Tear them asunderâquickâyour office, guards! Disarm, secure the traitor. Imog. At your perilâ Guards, touch him notâSirâlordsâBritonsâhe is, He is my husbandâmy espous'd, my heart's beloved, My Leonatus!â Cymb. Seize him, I sayâ Imog. Forbear, I charge ye!âWhatâ Your chief, the guardian of my father's throne, Britain's first boast, the glory of your country!â Cymb. Guards, traitors, slavesâyour lives shall answer this! Seize, stab, dispatch himâ [Guards turn their weapons on Leonatus. Imog. Mark your princess, firstâ Behold this poniard!âby the Power ye worship, By your tremendous Goddess, great Andateâ On your first motion to attempt his life, His precious life,âthis passes through my bosom! Cymb. Villains! I see ye are confederate all, Against your king. 'Tis well. Thus far I pardonâ I grant the traitor's life; but far removed From BritainâBy Andate too, I vow, If his returning step shall ever dare To press our shores, that moment is his lastâ He dies, I swearâhis blood shall pay the trespass, Although the blood of this unduteous girl Should mingle with the stream!â Leon. Yes, Cymbeline, Deluded prince! your soldier will depart, But take no traitor hence. Be well aware Of those he leaves behind! and, O, ye gods! Grant, that my honour'd father, and my king, May not find speedy reason for repentance; Look round for help in some distressful hour, And call, but call in vain, on Leonatus. Cymb. Away with himâto sea, to banishment, Distant as winds can waft!âAnd you, our Queen, Take this young rebel into close restraint, And see her chamber'd! [Women lay hold on her. Imog. Sir, my king, my father! Will you not grant your child one last adieu, PerhapsâO Heavenly powers!âperhaps, for ever. Cymb. Keep them asunderâBear them off, I say, Far from each other! Leon. O, thou departing light of all my life! Must I then lose thee, Imogen?âNight hangs On every road from hence!âBeyond this spot, The world alike is waste; a worthless blank, A wild of desolation!â Cymb. Henceâawayâ Away with them.â Imog. My lord!â [Struggling with her women. Leon. My only life!â Imog. Adieu! Leon. Adieu! O Imogen!â Imog. O Leonatus!â [They are taken off severally. [Exeunt Cymbeline, Lords, and Attendants. Clot. Now, mother, there is room for hope. Queen. No, Cloten! This was beside my aimâI had him sure, Just on the brink, from whence this foolish king Unwillingly hath snatched himâHere is goldâ Hasteâfind that one-eyed ruffian, with his fellows, Train'd and inured to blood!âIf he scape thus, 'Tis still in fate to cross us. Clot. What if I go along? Queen. Disguised? Clot. And masqued?â Queen. 'Tis well!âDispatch, my sonâ [Exeunt severally. SCENE VI. A Country on the Shore of the River Thames. Enter Caius Lucius, Clodio, and other Roman Officers. Lucius. Neptune hath smooth'd our way; the gods of wind And waters have conspired to make our passage As speedy as propitiousâValiant Clodio, While yet our legions disembark, appoint Such train as may befit thy embassy To Britain's neighbouring courtâThis pacquet bears The will of CÃ¦sar, and thy full instructions. Clod. A Briton, here, informs me, that the house Of Cymbeline is all in wondrous ferment, Raised by a son of fortune, who hath wived The daughter of his Kingâone Leonatus. Lucius. How! Leonatus? Clod. Have you knowledge, then, Of this adventurer? Lucius. Yes, a dear remembranceâ So hath the world's sole ruler, great Augustus, With many of the noblest sons of Rome. So fair an outside, and such worth within, Endows no second man. Clod. You stretch him, sure, Beyond his limits. Lucius. NoâAt Actium, Clodioâ But you, as I must think, were not at Actiumâ There, this unbearded boy, unbearded then, With wonders took the eye of CÃ¦sar captive. The battle done, he call'd, and question'd him Touching his birth and country; when the youth, Blushing, replied, that, as he knew no sire, He was not worth a nameââBe henceforth, then, âThe son of CÃ¦sar,â cried our emperor, And named him Leonatus. Clod. Let him pass; For, till this hour, to me he has been nameless. Lucius. The daughter of his king?âNow, on my soul, If I did deem aright, he might have had The daughter of our emperor, the first In beauty, as in birth. Clod. O, Momus, hear!â Julia prefer a savage, to the choice Of Rome's unrival'd demigods? Lucius. Believe me, I was not single in such thoughts. But then, Drawn by some strong attachment back to Britain, He quitted the warm shine of CÃ¦sar's favour, And left the emulators of his virtue To wonder and to mournâWe since have learn'd, The Scots, a wild and warlike race of men, Sprung from an isle that constitutes the brink Of our expanded world, beyond whose verge Nature herself has nothing to behold, Save air and oceanâthose fierce men, I say, Broke in on Britain. All, from end to end, Was flight and panic; till this Leonatus Alone made head, and drove those boisterous kerns Back to their wattled hives. And well, I deem, Well he may match the daughter of the man, Whose crown he has redeem'd. Soldier enters. Sold. A noble prisoner waits. Lucius. Conduct him to us. SCENE VII. Leonatus enters. Lucius. Immortal powers! the very man we dream'd of.â My friend, my best beloved, my Leonatus! [Embrace. By the gods, welcomeâwelcomest of aught The gods themselves could send!âWhence, from what chance, What happy chance? Leon. O Lucius, son of Rome, Best loved, and best respectedâyou behold A wretched outcast, thrown, as with a sling, From all his heart holds dear. Lucius. Banish'd? Leon. Even so. Lucius. O, Capitolian Jove, thou dost infatuate Those thou wouldst ruin!âCast their shield away!â What now shall guardian their abandon'd side, Against the sword of Rome?âMy Leonatus, The valiant Clodio. [They salute. Say, my soul's elect, Where may your purpose bend? Leon. In sooth, I know notâ To Gaulâor possibly, to Rome and CÃ¦sar. Lucius. If you are not upon the spur from hence, We would entreat your sojourn with our love, Till we may burden you with some dispatches To CÃ¦sar and our friends. Leon. Alas, for me, The world affords no wish, no way from hence, Save what may serve a friend. Lucius. Within the minute, My thanks and I attend you. [Exit Lucius. Clod. Noble stranger! Your aspect bears a seal of such mishap, As saddens all who see. May any cause Be worth this sum of woe? Leon. If, to have lost Whatever earth can yield of estimation, Or fancy frame in Heaven, be worth a sighâ Then mine are honest tribute. Clod. Sir, you are young; Just at the tide of spring, that overbears The flats of common senseâOft have I known Untutor'd passion, desperate from the loss Of the most slight and worthless thing on earth, A womanâ Leon. A woman!âDoes your sentence, judging sir, Extend beyond the stews? Clod. Throughout the world's Wide orbit. Nature form'd their flippant sex Upon the model of the sea-born dame, Whose knowledge takes in all of gods and men, From Mars to soft Adonis. Leon. Fie, fie!âthis foul opinion Strumpets thy mother in her urn. Clod. My mother Stood on a line with her, the chastest she, Whose fond inamorato, in his brain, Now figures for a phÃ¦nix. I sap not The credit of a single fair; but mourn, That any gallant man, should tie his faith, His peace, and valued honours, to a thing That none alive can keepâPlace me a cloud 'Twixt Dian and Endymion, my estate, My manhood for the pledge, that I transfer The horns from her to him. Leon. O, I do know, I do know oneâbut such another, till, By the same pattern, nature shall renew The beauty of her worksâlike to that one, Another can't be known!âBy great Andate, The sight would throw a rein of dumb restraint On that licentious tongueâOne chastening look, One aweful glance of her reproving eye, Would freeze the hottest libertine of Rome To still and downcast reverence! Clod. Is she native Of any world yet known? Leon. Your Italy, A stranger to her virtues, as you say, Records her nameâ'Tis Imogen! Clod. The peerless heir of Britain!âO ye gods, A plumb, a province, for the wish'd encounter! Leon. Away, slight, empty braggard!âwhat couldst thou, Where even Hyperion, or the Roman Jove, Born, as to LÃ¦da once, on downy pinions; Or, in his still more tempting form of gold, Though dropt into her lap, in all his glory, Should find her truth more strong than his seduction? Clod. She is a woman stillâI go, this hour, To Cymbeline from CÃ¦sarâHad I means Of fair address, I, here, would freely gage My villa, rated at the rich return Of fifty annual talents, that I bring Sure proof she renders up her chastest hoard To my free arbitration. Leon. Insolent!â Thou darest not gage. Clod. By Jupiter, I think You will not dare the trial. Leon. To convince thee Of thine own arrogance, and my contempt, Thou shalt have letters to herâMark me, yet; On thy return, the convict of thy folly, 'Tis not thy villa onlyâno, thy blood Shall pay the penalty of this presumption!â Prepare to answer with thy sword. Clod. Agreed. Leon. Till then I hold no converse with a ruffian, Though dignified by Rome.âI'll send the letters. [Exeunt severally. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Lucius and Leonatus. Lucius. O no, my Leonatus! Indeed it was not wellâhad I been present This wager had not past. Leon. Why, honour'd friend? From brutal violence, or saucy insult, She is well guarded in her father's courtâ What is there then to fear? Lucius. Ill blood, at leastâ And possibly the venture of a life, That is most dear to Lucius!âThis same Clodio, For skill in weapons, and a bearlike boldness, Is rank'd among the foremost. Leon. Never, yet, Was I confronted with a son of Rome, So rudely manner'd. Lucius. All, of CÃ¦sar's court, Are not of CÃ¦sar's confidence, nor yet Of his commissioning; howe'er, by means Of second links, and golden interventions, A brute of fortune mayn't be far from favour. The first of Clodio's faults is, want of virtue; The second, that he hates it in another. Agrippa link'd him with me in commission; Nature forbids all further tie between us. Leon. Let him be weigh'd, before you hold him worth Another wordâBut say, my noble friend, Is war determined against Britain, then, In all the bloody process and extent Of military licence? Lucius. War, or tributeâ Such is the will of CÃ¦sar! Yet we bear The Roman sword, but, with more surety, To plant the Roman olive. Leon. Tribute, Lucius! Do ye insist on tribute? Lucius. Some light matterâ But as a term that may express submission. Leon. O, 'tis in that, in that alone, my friend, That tribute turns to lead!âA drachm of weight, A straw, a feather, to a freeborn mind, Becomes a mountain's burden, when imposed The badge of vile dependence! Lucius. Noble creature! Conceive me as the duteous minister Of CÃ¦sar's will, not mine. And yet my will And power are now intent to place a friend Even on the throne of that unthankful country, From whose rejecting arms he late was cast, A hopeless exile! Leon. How!ârestored to Britain?â Revenge?âmy Imogen?âimperial power?â And CÃ¦sar's favour? Lucius. All, by holy friendship, I swear it, all are thine. Leon. Alas! my Lucius, I did but sum the bright temptation up, Just to behold the value, for a moment, Of what I must reject.â Say Lucius, that same Roman, who derived His name of glory from Corioli, Was he not banish'd? Lucius. Yes. Leon. And turn'd his sword Against his country?â Lucius. True; and, thereby, shew'd To thankless Rome, the richness of the pearl Their pride had cast away. Leon. And was enroll'd Among her heroes?â Lucius. Trust me, with the foremost. Leon. O wayward man, deluded, by the glare And wildfire of ambition, from the path That Goodness brightens with unsetting glory!â The Line of Duty is a Rubicon, Whose bounds no power, in earth or Heaven, can take Or give a right to pass!âTrue Honour, Lucius, From the beginning to the end of things, Goes hand in hand with Virtue! Lucius. O, the gods! Let me behold himâLet my wonder mark The greatness of your works! Soldier enters. Sold. The legions are all landed, and attend Their general's voice, for march, or for encampment. Lucius. I come. [Exit Soldier. My Leonatus, while I touch, and talk, [Takes his hand. And breathe within the region of thy virtues, I too, methinks, grow greater than Augustus; And feel, in these expandings of my soul, That honour's more than empire. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Palace of Cymbeline. Queen and Cloten enter opposite. Queen. Well, Clotenâhast thou?âHow is thisâa face Of damp and disappointment!âO, thou shouldst Have come, with triumph, prologue, in thy looks; And blood-besprinkled garments, to foreshew The important deed was done! Clot. Perdition catch him! And dangers, great as he has just escaped, For ever close him round, that no curs'd chance, No sudden arm may snatch him from the brink, Till he is sunk, past sight. Queen. What, safe, unhurt? The lion scaped the toils?ânay, then, our clue Of fate again is ravelled. Clot. I had gotten A pack of blood-hounds, staunch, as ever open'd On the hot scent of near appointed slaughter. We took us to the Thames, plied sail and oarâ Forward we shot, pursuedâour eyes o'ertook him, Held him in view, and gain'd upon our prey; Till, just as when the frighted hare appears Within the straining greyhound's jawsâdamn'd hap!â A Roman galley crost, and took him in; And all our tugging rowers scarce avail'd To warrant our own freedom. Queen. Soft, the King. SCENE III. Enter King, Imogen, Lords, Guards, &amp;c. Cymb. So near, and landed, sayst thou?âThis is magic. No word of preparation, or approach! Our watchers have conspired, with winds and seas, To bring this storm upon us.âWhat's their power? Mess. About five legions, sheath'd in arms of proof, And close-appointed. Cymb. Give us but note for double that amount, And we will charge them to the beard.âCingetorix, Light up our beacons, give the alarm throughout. And, Cadwal, call our train'd brigades together. My Queen!âalthough thy Mars is not, as when, A stripling, he aspired to win a plume From the first CÃ¦sar; they shall find him, yet, Equal in closing arms to aught that's less Than their almighty Julius. Gods! I thank ye For this addition of a late renown, Though at the stake and peril of our crown. [Exeunt all but Imogen. Imog. All is in uproar!âhere and there they run, They know not whither; or, in fixt affright, Freeze to the spot they pressâAlack, for them!â But, wherefore am not I in like alarm?â O greater woe!âto me no gain can come; And I am already sunk so low in loss, As mocks at lowerâTime and life, what are yeâ While fill'd with thought, yet emptied of the thing That made your value? Time, and life, and thought, You are my wretchedness.âO Leonatus! SCENE IV. A Servant enters followed by Clodio. Serv. Madam, a knight of Rome attends your pleasure, With letters from my lord. [Exit. Clod. Nay, change not, ladyâ The noble Leonatus is in safety, And honour'd me with these. [Gives Letters. Imog. Thanks, courteous sir!â O, learn'd, indeed, were that astronomer, Who knew the stars as I his characters; He'd lay the future openâWax, thy leave. Blest be the bees that made these locks of counsel! Good news, good gods! [Reads. Clod. All of her, that is out of door, most rich!â If she be furnish'd with a mind as rare, She is alone the Arabian Bird; and I, In rashly seeking after my own shame, Have lost myselfâAudacity befriend me! Imog. Most welcome, worthy sir!âfor my dear lord Here sends thrice happy tidings, that he is near, And well, and well protected in the love Of the most noble LuciusâGenerous sir, You have chear'd a hopeless mournerâwelcome, welcome! Have you aught else, in kind commission, from My Leonatus; or, if not from him, From your kind self?âas, how he look'd, or talk'd Or smiled, or moved; or, with what circumstance He gave this blest remembranceâThese are things, In love's fond lore, of infinite import, Though nothing to you wise ones. Clod. Royal lady, I blush to find myself not duly versed In this sweet erudition. I have nought, Worthy of like memorial, to deliver, Save, that our friend, our happy Leonatus, Bade me renew the plightings of his faith, Upon this peerless wax. [Offers to kiss her handâshe withdraws it. Imog. How, sir!âI find you grow alike forgetful Of me, and of your messageâHereâwho waits? Clod. Your pardon, fair!âwherein have I offended? Imog. Is it the custom, for your Roman dames To be so ill respected? Clod. Gracious goddess! What you misdeem for insolence, with us Marks the submissive sign of adoration; And the fair hand of our imperial Julia, Is daily worship'd by the lips of thousands. Imog. Fashion may change with fancyâGentle sir, I trust your knowledge will excuse our wants, And yet conform to what it findsâStill, welcome! All's well, I hopeâpray take my power for yours, And to your full content. Clod. Surpassing creature! Were I commission'd to call forth the winds, From east and west, to winnow her throughout, The gods, the gods, I find, have made her chaffless. [Aside. Consummate queen! scepter'd in every soul That bends before perfection!âthere is, yet, One favourâ Imog. Ask with confidenceâbelieve it Already granted. Clod. I am come, express, From Rome to Cymbeline, and bring a coffer That bears the seal of CÃ¦sar, yet inviolate. Within, 'tis freighted with some rich contents Of rare device, and precious estimation; Gifts from Augustus to your royal sire, Your princely self, and his adopted son, Your peerless Leonatus.âFor this night, I wish them safe; and safest I should deem them In your protection, lady. Imog. Send them hither; And, for the sake of that most valued part, Respective to my lord, I'll see them stow'd In my own chamber.âI will answer, truly, To your best trustâand so, good sir, good night! Clod. My soul bows down to thank you. Peace, and slumbers Sweet as your graces, wait you till the morning? [Exeunt severally. SCENE V. Enter King, Queen, Cloten, Lords, Guards, and Roman Herald. A Parchment, with a large Seal, in the Hand of Cymbeline. Cymb. It is the seal of CÃ¦sarâTell me, herald, Who comes with these credentials? Herald. The valiant Clodio, second in command To our most noble Lucius. Cymb. He is welcomeâ We are prepared to hear himâlet him enter. SCENE VI. Enter Clodio with a Train of Romans. Cymb. First, Clodio, for thyself and those brave Romans, Our Britain greets ye wellâOur further answer Waits to be measured by your errandâSay, With us, what would Augustus? Clod. Thus, saith CÃ¦sar: Nature, through Heaven and earth, hath form'd her works In due subordination. One Supreme Rules each appointed province.âSol, who now Drinks at the nether ocean, through the round Of the wide Empyreum, where he walks Among ten thousand thousand lesser lights, Beholds no rival!âIn like manner, reigns Jove over gods; and, over mortals, CÃ¦sarâ But, not with lawless sway.âRome, Cymbeline, Whose empire gathers in the scatter'd realms Of our remotest world, spreads forth her wings, Even as a parent-bird, to shield her young, And fosters while she rulesânor would leave out Your distant Britain from the wide protection. Cymb. Protection! have we sought it?âSay to CÃ¦sar, That Britain is a world within herself, Imperial, independent; from the birth Of nature, set apart, fair, full, and free, And all-sufficient ever. Britain is Another sea-born Venus, girt around With her cerulean cestus, her chaste zone, Which Rome shall not untie.âProtection! where, Where was this proud display of Rome's protection, When every petty state of petty Latium, Gave her to tremble for herself?âNo, Roman! Britain is likelier, o'er a subject world, To stretch her own domain, than from that world To learn the lesson of a vile subjection. When Rome shall ask our help, our will and power May answer to her wants; we want not her's, Nor will accept such Greek-like giftsâProtection! Britain, we trust, shall well protect herself From such protectors. Clod. Your uncle Cassibelan, Cymbeline, Would not have answer'd our first CÃ¦sar thus. Cymb. My uncle Cassibelan, Clodio, Did answer your first CÃ¦sar thusâthat Julius, Whose boast of conquest over mighty nations, Was, that âhe came and saw.ââWas that his boast O'er Britain also?âNo.âAt first, he smiled At our small skill; but soon was taught to frown At our great courage. Twice repuls'd, and driven To hide his shame in Gaul, at length he learn'd, By force of faction, rather than of steel, With our own arms to win us.âIf the gods Shall ever doom us to a foreign yoke, 'Tis not the arms of Rome, or of the world, We have to fearâBritain can only fall By Britain! Clod. Your uncle, Cassibelan, in behalf Of his succeeders in the British throne, Did gage to Julius, his acknowledg'd lord, A yearly rent of seventy golden talents. Cymb. Let Julius claim!âHe laid his country, too, Under like contribution.âTell me, Roman, Did Brutus well, when, by one godlike stroke, He gave her freedom? Clod. We have nought with this.â We come to claim the tributeâWhat's your answer? Cymb. That ye have ta'en us somewhat unprovidedâ Of money?âno, but marshal'd menâwith such We mean to pay you.âTribute! wherefore tribute? When CÃ¦sar can obscure the golden sun, Or hold the winds from breathing upon Britain, He may demand a tax for light and airâ Till then, no tribute, Clodio. Clod. Yet, bethink you. Loth am I to pronounce the world's wide lord An enemy to Britain; to call forth Rome's thunder yet restrain'd, confusion, wrath, And ruin, not to be resisted.âCÃ¦sar, Who numbers more of monarchs in his train, Than Cymbeline of menial servitors, Yet tenders peace and amity. Cymb. On terms Of equal amity, we would embrace him. But, why, with present menace, do we deem Of future issues, which the gods, alone, Have in their keeping?â Let us be brief, and sum our last resolves. Clod. War, or submission? Cymb. Liberty, or death!â Lords, give our guests such tendence, as befits Their high conditionâA good night to all. [Exeunt severally, Cymbeline and his Attendantsâ Clodio and his train. Queen. Cloten, I do bethink me, that the gods, If there are gods, or dÃ¦mons, or whate'er, That may obtrude their influence, unask'd, On mortal counsels, or concernsâI think, We have no cause to thank themâLeonatus Is now beyond our reach; and Cymbeline Must not be laid to sleep, until the known Events of war shall tell us when to strike. His daughter, too!âbut for thy foolish lusts, That bar had been away, by this. Clot. My mother, I ask you not to give her to my loveâ Yet, spare her to my vengeance, to the chastening That's due to her contempts!âBy all the gods, Should she escape inviolate, your Cloten Must pine upon the throne. Queen. Well then, be speedy. Clot. The King has put me into large commission. Queen. The King, my child?âno matter for the King; He's ours already. 'Tis the Roman power That's yet in doubtâBoth sides must be secured, That fate may find no further way to cross us. Clot. And how may thatâ Queen. No moreâbut be attentive.â With the first dawn, take this dispatch to Clodio. It is addrest to Lucius, Rome's elect For this high expedition; and imports A tender, on our part, to great Augustus, Of double tribute, and our Pictish bands, In aid of Rome's thin legionsâthus condition'd, That Britain's crown should be confirm'd to us. Be close and dark as nightâAway, my son, To bed, and dream of honours! [Exeunt severally. SCENE VII. A Bedchamber. Imogen enters, with a Book and Taper. A large Coffer in a Corner. Imog. The night's far goneâIt is a sleepy tale, [Lays by the Book. And I'll to bedâThou ever wakeful Fancy, Who makest new worlds, and peoplest them with beings At thine own willâO, take my Leonatus Into thy kind creation; give him to me In all his love and loveliness, a shade Passing all waking substance!âso shall night Atone my griefs by day; and, what is not, Be prized o'er all that isâ [Lies down. From every power of darkness, guard me, gods! And ope your Heaven within! [Sleeps. Clodio rises cautiously out of the Coffer. Clod. SoftâAll is stillâexcept the cricket's chirp; And the death-worm, that ticks its midnight watch To silenceâTarquin, thus, with stealthy pace Came o'er the sleeping Lucrece, ere he waked The chastity he woundedâFirst, to mark The tales impannell'd on the pictured boards, And needled in the arras. The fifteenth DanaideâHero, from the tower, And, from the beach, Alcione, just sprung To join their loves below.âPanthea, arm'd Against her life, hangs o'er her mangled lord! Strike, woman, Put the beholder out of pain!âBy Proserpine, All that is fabled, yet, of female worth, Is call'd together here, to be affirm'd By yonder sole perfection!âNow, for marks Of nearer, dearer annotationâsuch As may, with jealous frenzy, rend the soul Of that loved, envied, curs'd, detested savage!â Gentlyâas mousers tread by nightâKind sleep, Image of death, lie thou upon her sense, As monumental marble on a tomb In some still chapel.â'Tis her breathing, sure, That thus perfumes the chamberâCytherea, How thou dost sanctify thy shrine!âfair lilly, Queen of the valeâmore spotless, yet, within, Than all external purityâSoft, soft, Come off, thou precious bond, come offâ'Tis mineâ [Takes off her bracelet. A witness against truth, more strong, than all Our Roman batteries!âO, the gods! what's here?â On the left side, beneath the beauteous pap, A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops Ith'bottom of a cowslipâHere's a voucher, Beyond what law can make!âShe stirs!âenoughâ I'll to my trunk againâ Ye dragons, who draw on the team of night, Ply fast your leathern wings, that chearful morn May rise to win my freedom! [Goes into the coffer.âThe scene closes. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Country. A Wood and Cavern at a distance. Leonatus and Faustus enter. Leon. Faustus, look outâthey cannot yet have pastâ This way returns them to the camp. Faust. They comeâ 'Tis Clodio's trumpetâ Leon. Get thee, then, apart, [Exit Faustus. Till we have closed our conferenceâIf Lucius Has justly stiled him brave, he will not take The vantage of his numbers, to debate Against a single armâ SCENE II. Clodio and his Retinue. [Leon.] Clodio, thrice welcome. A word, with your good pleasure; and that word, As you are a valiant Roman, asks no witness.â Might not your train proceed?â Clod. Yesâforwardâon! [To his Retinue, who go out. I'll followâNow, your will.â Leon. You bear, in mind, Your insult, and late offer'd enterprize Against my wife. Clod. You named her not as such. I hold my friend's connubial couch for sacred, Although his spouse should place the pillow for me, And wooe me to the parley. Leon. Wellâpass thatâ And say, what rich returns thou hast brought home From thy bold venture to the coast of beauty. Is there no worth, save what is masculine? Or, does the weather-gage of thine opinion Turn from that restive point? Clod. Your pardon, sir. You menaced me at parting. I hold not My life so cheap to risque it for a woman. Grant a safe course and latitude of converse, Or here my tale is ended. Leon. I do swear it. Give me fair facts. I quarrel not with truth, Though it should blast meâThou hast seen a princessâ Clod. Unparagon'dâa wonder, even to eyes That have seen all things else! Leon. And her chaste name, Still unimpeach'd. Clod. It is my soul's firm faithâ No woman chaster, or more fondly bound To the memorial of an absent husband. Leon. O, I did know my Imogen was chaste, As snow new-fallen upon the mountain top; And constant as the vine that clasps its elm, And dies upon divisionâSay, good Clodio, Wast thou not welcomed? Clod. Yesâat onceâmost warmly. In that I was a debtor to her love For LeonatusâAt the kindly close Of our first interview, I did advise her Of some rare matters that I brought from Rome, And begg'd permission at her shrine to lay Great CÃ¦sar's offeringâwith a gracious nod, The goddess gave assent. Leon. Onâwhat ensued? Clod. Our audience at the British courtâ'twas longâ The night was then advancedâ'twas lateâtime press'd. I urged, and was admitted to her chamber. Leon. Her chamber!âwas it her's?âart thou assured?â But, say it wereâand so thou might'st have been To that of Lucreceâ Clod. True.âI laid before her Rich robings, gems of curious set, and pearls That left the Orient poorâno futile nets For feminine affections. Leon. Wellâthe process. Clod. While she retired, in safety to dispose Her precious lading, I did mark the chamberâ The tale-recording tapestry and paintings, Storied, I doubt, with more of nuptial truth Than quondam husbands met with.âSoon return'd, She held me to discourse, with pleasant questions Touching our Roman gallantries and customs. Leon. Was thy stay long? Clod. Long?ânoâour present nights Serve but as prologue to an early dawning. Leon. Plague and perdition!â [Aside. How were ye employ'd? Clod. Nay, take your colour to youâNo harm done; Nothing but chat, and inoffensive dalliance. Leon. Slave, villain, lyar!âby the gods, 'tis falseâ Dalliance! Clod. Your oath is forfeitâfare you wellâ [Going, Leon. Come back, thou scap'st not soâProduce me, here, Some token, but the lightest feather, won From her high-plumed virtueâor, by hell, Whereto thou goest, thy latest glass is run! Clod. You shall be satisfiedâBut will you, then, Be peaceful? Leon. I do swear itâthough the proof, Like the Tarantula's envenom'd touch, Should sting me into madness. Clod. Know you this?â [Shews the bracelet. Leon. Gape hell, and swallow all affiance up! All faith and trust, and fabled truth, in woman! Know it?âtoo well!âit was our band of nuptials, With these confiding fingers fondly tied, Even on the marriage night.âHow gott'st thou this? Tempter acccurs'd!âthe meansâthe circumstanceâ Clod. Half by consentâand half, by sweet constraintâ I loosed, and toy'd it from her. Leon. O, I see It is enough!âthy triumph is accomplish'd Over our peace and honour.âGet thee hence!â It must, yet cannot beâHold, Clodioâanswer! Hast thou not practised on her cooler blood, With some infernal drug?âor, by thyself, Or some confederate villainy, purloin'd That specious trophy?âHave I found thee, Cacus? Traced thy steps backward to thy den? Clod. So leave it.â Why, what have I affirm'd to touch you, thus, With jealous frenzy?â Have I yet told you of the crimson gem, That sweetly nestles under the left swell Of her descending bosom? Leon. O, I am choak'd!â She's wreck'dâthe world's bright pinnace sunk for ever! Should thousands of concurring witnesses Rise to her honour now, I'd not believe them.â Is there no hook to hold me from the brink, Where the brain turns?âYetâarm me with a reed, And I will fight for her departed truth, Though demonstration should be sheath'd in steel, And weapon'd right and leftâFiend! damn'd magician! [Seizes Clodio. How hast thou wrought impossibilities? SoftâI have swornâyour pardon, gods!âAll's wellâ Depart in peaceâQuickâhenceâlest sudden wrath Grind out thy soul, and scatter thee as dust! [Exit Clodio. Down, climbing passions! whither would ye mountâ To spurn at Heaven and fate, who made things so, As cannot now be mended?âRuin! ruin! Worse than the wreck of nature!âIs it thus?â Or is it a negationâall, a whirl Of things that are but dreamt of?âHold, hold fast The seat of reason, gods! a little spaceâ For somewhat is to doâRacks, dying pangs, What are ye, to the fall of Heaven's own house, The human mind o'erthrown?âI must be speedy. Faustus!â Enter Faustus. Faust. My lord.â Leon. Come hither, my good Faustusâ Thou seest thy master at the heaviest plunge That ever call'd for help.âThou hast lost thy master! Faust. Alas!â Leon. His name and honours laid, all, low in earth, No fosterer, friend, or mournful step attending!â I thank thy tearsâmine cannot chuse but follow. âFaustus! Faust. What would my heart's belov'd master? Leon. I snatch'd thee, once, from twenty circling deaths, At peril of my life.â Faust. You did, you did. Leon. And thou art sworn, on any quick extreme Of life or death, to do my fearful bidding, No question ask'd. Faust. I live, but till you say, Die, Faustus! Leon. Didst thou hear aught that past? Faust. Too much!âWhat's to be done? Leon. I had a wife! Faust. Dispatch her! Leon. And, so, quench the kindling fires Of lust and foul dishonour, that must, else, Blaze to a pointing world!â Faust. Right. Leon. Wilt thou?â Faust. Yes. It shall be done. Leon. Not butcher-like, my Faustusâ But gently, as the nurse would lay to sleep Her querulous babeâ O, give her not the twenty thousandth pang Such as now grapple at my soul!âBe speedyâ And, when the deed is done, thou mayst expect me Near the great oak, that neighbours to the temple. Faust. Farewell, farewell!âbe happy, as you can, My best, my noblest master! [Exit Faustus. Leon. This Clodio, too, must be provided for, At the next turnâWhy, this is gallant!âsoon, I shall be deep in blood. These buffettings of fortune, how they harden A heart, once, not inhuman!â The sources of my living shame once stopt, What follows?âwhat is to be reap'd from seeds, Sown thus, or thus?âEternity, to me, Can yield no future harvest!âIf I look For peace in Heaven, or o'er the travell'd earth, Through life, or time, or aught beyond, still, still, I meet it so bound up in Imogen, As never to be sunder'd!âO, my love! O, my lost love!âO wretched, past resource! Undone, undone, lost, ruin'd Leonatus! [Exit. SCENE III. Near the Cavern. Bellarius enters from it. Bell. Hail, Power! whoe'er thou art, who sitt'st supreme O'er good and evil, o'er this fair immense Of manifold existence, worlds replete With works of varied grace!âI will not ask How partial Ill hath fallen into the ways Of wisdom infinite. The time may come, When Thou shalt reign unquestioned, unopposedâ When guilt and pain shall ceaseâwhen to be good And happy, must be oneâand all shall grow Consummate, and renew'd, within the will Of their great maker!â There rests my last of hope; and, thence, I learn, To bear such ills as seem to pass all sufferanceâ Heaven, what a glorious form!âSome vision, sure, [Looks out. So far excelling all of mortal seeming!â Alas, it wrings at some distress! Can aught Of Empyrean temper, thus, extort Pity from poor humanity? SCENE IV. Leonatus enters. Bright being!â How may the native of an upper sphere Appear partaker of the general woe, That makes the lot of man? Leon. O sire revered! You see a man, of miserable men The lowest, and most lost. Bell. Son of my age, Son of my sorrows alsoâif sage counsel, Or kind companionship in grief, may serve To sooth calamity; then art thou come Into the land of balms. Leon. No balm for wounds, Deep as existence! Bell. That's a depth, beyond What death himself can strike! The cause was, sure, Most capital. Leon. It was, it wasâthe same That sack'd the seven-fold walls of aged Priam, Butcher'd his race, and laid his Asia wasteâ A woman's want of truth! Bell. O, I could pour Into a friendly hearing, such a tale Of a lost woman, as should soon exile All woe, save that alone, which is comprized In her sad story! Leon. Once, I had a tear For griefs that were not mineâProceed, good father! Bell. The present King of Britain had a sister. Who saw her not, could form no semblance of her From aught that he had seenâI woo'd, and won, And wedded her in secret.â But, O, the richness of the bright possession! The world wants wealth to rate it. Three blest moons, Three moons, the brightest that had ever changed Upon the changeful bliss of man, scarce wain'd, When I was sent ambassador, by Cymbeline, To Julius, Rome's dictatorâWoe the while! My love, my bride, my Adelaide proved pregnantâ She was impleaded of incontinence, Even by her cruel brother was impleaded, And urged to name the sireâbut, kindly fearing What, haply, might befall the hapless man, Whom more than life she loved, she, to the death, Persisted in her silence; and was offer'd, On the curs'd altar of the dire Andate, The richest incense of the truest love That ever breathed to Heaven! Leon. Thrice happy husband! Death may soon draw the veil that, from your arms, Shuts your expecting Adelaideâbut mine No kind hereafter can restore!âYour pardonâ Forward, I pray. Bell. Thine eyes, my son, grow heavyâ Come to my friendly cave, and I will try, With the sad tale of my remaining woes, To charm thy griefs to slumber. Leon. O, for ever!â That were to be most happy. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Faustus and Imogen enter. Faust. We have crost the public paths, and, now, are past All risque of further question. Imog. Stay thee, Faustus. This is a gloomy placeâI feel my senses Seiz'd with I know not what of sudden horror!â Where is my lord, where is my Leonatus? Didst thou not say?âWhy pales thy colour, man? Why dost thou look with that stern pity on me?â What dost thou search and feel for? Faust. Nothing, mistressâ Be not alarm'd!âWhere left you that same bracelet, Which my fond master, on his nuptial night, Bound to you with his troth? Imog. Alas, good Faustus, Even all the gems that light my father's crown, I'd give for its redemption. Late, last night, I pray'd, and thought upon my love, and wept; And kiss'd that holy relick of his faith, And dreamt of him till morningâwhen awaking, I found my arm was worthless! Faust. O, beware, It be not gone to tell my lord strange tales Of woman's breach of faith! Imog. How, Faustus! Noâ My honour sits above the blast of slander; And, like the top of Atlas, bears a Heaven Upon a mount of snow.âI do assure thee, Had I been born in any age, save that In which my Leonatus won my soul, With graces all his own, I should have died The votary of Dian. Faust. Pardon, mistress!â Know you one Clodio? Imog. A Roman, is he not?âHe brought me letters From my heart's master. Faust. That same Clodio, ladyâ Did you admit him to your chamber? Imog. How!â Thou dost amaze me, Faustus. Save the time He told his message in, before, nor since, I never met, nor mark'd him. Faust. By the gods, Within this hour, these eyesâthe amazed eyes Even of your Leonatusâsaw that bracelet In Clodio's boastful hand! Nay, he did quote Each sure memorial of your bedchamberâ Described your midnight scene of wanton dalliance, With such leud deeds, as would have turn'd to shame A face of solid bronze.âHe stript you, lady; And gave to record such peculiar notes, Found on your precious body, as a chaste one Would not deliver to the settled gaze Of a loved consort. Imog. Ohâ [Faints. Faust. The swoon of death is on her!âO sole flower, Of Britain's summer! hast thou vanish'd, then, So sudden?âTongue accurs'd!âNo need of steel For murder, hereâthe very touch of shame Hath cut her thread of life!âO Imogenâ Awake, sweet mistress!âbeggar not the world With loss of all its worth.âI will maintain it, Against ten thousand villains, such as Clodio, Tho' champion'd to the teeth, that thou art wrong'd. What proofs can front that purity of faceâ The book, where Heaven, in characters divine, Hath writ down truth and honour?âShe recovers. Imog. Away, and let me die. Faust. Cheer you, my royal lady; cheer, sweet mistress!â You are injuredâby the gods, you areâI know it. Some traitorous machination, deep as hellâ And there I'll dive, but I will bottom it! Look up, transcendent Imogen, nor cloud The face of Heaven with grief!â Tell me, my spotless, my thrice honour'd lady, Did you not take some presents, at the hand Of that damn'd Clodio? Imog. No. Faust. Rich robes, and gems Of oriental lustre?â Imog. Nothing of them.â He spoke indeed of matters sent, by CÃ¦sar, To me and to my lord; and pray'd I'd take The coffer that contain'd them, for one night, Into safe custody. Faust. A coffer, mistress?â A coffer!âwas it large? Imog. The men, who bore it, Bent at the burden. Faust. Certainâit is so!â I have found him, deep as Erebusâthe fiend!â Curs'd Clodio, ruthless, ravening hound of hell! There shall be blood for thisâa number'd pang For every pang that we have felt. O, my deceived, distracted, happy master! O injured innocence, sweet Imogen, Blest, precious mistress!âO the gods, the gods, Blest be the gods for this! Imog. Why dost thou weep, Good Faustus? Faust. O! for joy, for joy, to find That you are safe, and spotlessâ Even as a chrystal vase, intire, and clear, No flaw nor stain throughout.âCome, dearest lady. I will entrust you to revering hands, The priestess of Andate's neighbouring temple.â Then, to my lord, with the most rapturous tidings That ever blest his ear! [Exeunt. SCENE VI. The Palace. Enter King, Queen, Cloten, &amp;c. Cymb. Spread several waysâbreak open all the locksâ Search close!âShe can't be farâMalicious fortune Takes the worst time to cross us! Queen. Good, my liege, Faustus, the slave of banish'd Leonatus, Was seen, some few hours since. Put we to this, That Leonatus, most assuredly, Hath join'd his arm to that of Romeâwhat follows? But that the princess is, with Faustus, fled; And, with her paramour, will shortly come To claim your kingdom. Cymb. My kingdom, madam?â I want my child, my Imogenâmy kingdom Is not of my begettingâO, my Queen, You have a child!âI would to Heaven, that mine, From my fond arms, may not have been dislodg'd By usage too ungentle.âCloten, fly!â Take with thee a swift band of our light-arm'dâ Pursue, and save her for me. [Exit Cloten. The Roman, as we hear, intends, this day, To offer battle.âPatroness of Britain Inspire, and then dispose us, as thou wilt! Victorious goddess, great Andate, give Deathâor that good for which we wish to live! [Exeunt. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Wood and Cavern. Leonatus and Bellarius enter. Bell. Where did I leave?âbut age is narrative, And tiresome to your ear. Leon. No, father, noâ Could griefs, like mine, admit of consolation, 'Tis in your lenient converse. Bell. I have told you, Of the dark horror that involved my soul On my return to Britain, when I heard My Adelaide was lostâyet, how, with smiles I veil'd my depth of woe, till, on a day, I seiz'd the bloody hour of studied vengeance, And left the barbarous Cymbeline for dead. Thereon, I vainly sought a flight from sorrow, Through regions most remoteâstill the barb'd grief Stuck fast, and rankled inward. Sick, at length, Sick of the world, and all the busy ways Of empty anxious man, I wish'd to mix My mortal ashes with the native dust, From whence they first arose. Ten toilsome years I spent in travel; and ten lonely years Have found me here, secluded from the face Of aught save Heaven, in wishful expectation Of the last, painful, happy hour, that shall Strike off the shackles of mortality, And wing me to my love! Leon. But, is there not A shorter way to peace? Bell. O no, my son. The Power, who gave existence, can, alone, Have right to take it henceâAnd who shall warrant Peace to impatience? Leon. Father, about this time, a faithful slave Attends me, near at handâa little space Returns me to you. Bell. May the Power I worship, Restore your hopes, and run before your wishes! [Exit Leonatus. SCENE II. Bellarius retires towards the Cavern. Cloten enters attended. Clot. Our scent is warm; she can't be far from hence. Fly several ways, search well the sacred woodâ Who finds, and hales her to yon cave, I swear Is master of my purseâAway, and prosper! [Exeunt Attendants. Pan, and Priapus, aid me in the hour Of rape, and rapturous vengeance, on the charms Of scorning, struggling beautyâHark, old fellow! Didst see a man and maiden this way? Bell. No. Clot. Is yon den appertinent To thee and to thine heirs? Bell. It is. Clot. Not quite Unfurnish'd, holy father, as we hope, Of female consolation. Bell. Out upon thee! Clot. Canst thou not play the pandar, for a friend? Bell. Hence, abandon'd ruffian! Clot. Comeâshew me to thy rushes. Bell. Stopâlow wretch! Take caution of thine healthâthou com'st no further. Clot. Now, by Andate, I do much suspect Thou holdest, in thy saintly tutelage, The very wench I look forâGive me way. Bell. Bewareâ [Lifts his staff. Clot. Nay, then, thy shrivell'd autumn, thus Drops at my blast. [Draws. Bell. An arm, that was not wont To need the second lifting, greets thee, thusâ [Kills Cloten. Come, to the public pass, and, there, make trial If thou art worth the owning.â [Exit dragging out Cloten. SCENE III. Leonatus enters. Leon. Faustus is goneâor not yet comeâI met A man, who, passing in his haste, declared The princess missing, and the court in uproar. 'Tis soâthe deed is doneâor doing!âHold, Hold, Faustus, or I execrate thy duty, Worse than thy breach of faithâWhy should she die?â Who could survive, if all were to be doom'd For one defect in nature?âThat she loved me, The proofs are mighty, as the mighty proofs Of her incontinenceâWas not her heart Sufficient, then, to mineâtho' her sweet person Were common as the kissing air?âYes, Imogen, Give me thy heart, in life or death, all mine, I ask no other Heavenâbut, no intrusion, No sooty thought, no curs'd contamination! O that eternal robber, who hath foul'd The vessel of my peace! Though she were purged By fire tenfold intense, though steep'd an age In the Lethean surge, the deed obscene Would never from her thoughtâO, she must die!â That speaks the doom of Leonatus too, Who cannot live dividedâNo, I feel A force, more strong than nature, draw me after, Though never more to join herâImogen, My dearest Imogen, why, why was this?â If passion, boundless as the clasping air, And warm as the meridian, might suffice, It was not well, my love!âIs there no cure, No hope, no help for thisâto right or left, Or forward thro' the length of time, tho' stretch'd Far as existence?âO, sole misery!â Your pardon, Heaven!âI ask you not for bliss; I ask but for oblivion.â SCENE IV. To Leonatus enter Bellarius. Bell. Welcome, my son!âThe country's all in motionâ Some flying from, and some to arms! But, here, Within our cavern's maze, we rest secure, And smile at war and tumult. Leon. Noâwhen life Was prodigal of every promised bliss That youth could look for, honourable danger Ne'er saw my shoulder-bladeâand shall I now Turn from the death I wish to earn?âNo, father! An hour, and I am nothing, save a nameâ But it may be a loud one. A short joy Reanimates my bosomâGods, I thank ye!â Lost to myself, I shall be found to others, Found in the fixing of my country's rights; And, by my my death, affirm that liberty, Which makes the life of Britain. Bell. Be it so. Since we can't live, why, let us die together.â Hear me, thou son of my electing soul! Among the noble youth that graced our isle, I, once, stood obvious to the public eye, For thou wast not in being then; and when Discourse ran high on soldiership, my name Was not far offâIf thou dost think me, yet, Worthy thy fellowship in arms, then, help To buckle on my ancient mail. O, Thou, Whose will disposeth what thy wisdom form'd, Make our last hour a great one!âbe our day Of glorious dissolution, here on earth, Our natal-day in Heaven! Leon. My father, come! I long to emulate your high example; In your loved sight to have my prowess tried, And fall, applauded, by your honour'd side. [Exeunt. SCENE V. Drums and Trumpets. Romans march over the Stage. Clodio enters, his sword drawn. Clod. Closeâand with measured motion, as put on By one informing spirit, march, and join The ranging phalanx. As the Soldiers pass off the Stage, Faustus enters. Faust. If the loud din of war hath reach'd his ear, The field of honour is the likeliest place Wherein to find him.âClodio!âO, ye powers Of justice and of vengeance, nerve my arm, And ride upon my weapon!âGood, my lord, Your earâI bear a message to you. Clod. Whence? Faust. From my kind mistress. Clod. Speakâ Faust. In thunderâthus! [Draws. Clod. Presumptuous slave!âThen take this answer back, To thy detested master. [They fight, and Faustus fallsâExit Clodio. Faust. Curse on my feeble armâthat, thus, hath foil'd The cause it fought forâO, I see, I see, This world is not the soil where Heaven e'er meant To plant or prosper truth: it is the field Where the flagitious triumph!âIf there be In store for worth, or where wrong'd innocence May look for retributionâthat blest region Is far removed from hence. SCENE VI. Leonatus and Bellarius enter. Leon. My Faustus hereâ And bleeding! Faust. Blest godsâmine eyes, mine eyes Have seen him, ere they close for ever!âO, Your handâ'twill sooth me in my dying pangsâ My kindest, sweetest, dearest, noblest master! Leon. Alasâhow happen'd this? Faust. I vainly hoped To vindicate your quarrelâClodio is AâOhâmy time is scantyâImogenâ Be happy, for your Imogen isâOhâ [Dies. Leon. As thou art, my best Faustus,âO, my friend, My follower thro' all fortunes!âhad I time To pay the tribute due, I would embalm thee with my daily tears, And tomb thee in my bosom.âHelp me, father, Help to bear this kindest of Heaven's creatures Out of the public path, where trampling hoofs Might spurn his loved remains. [Exeunt bearing the Body. SCENE VII. Cymbeline and Britons enter. Cymb. Bid our scythed chariots wheel to either hand, And flank our wingsâmyself will point the wedge, With which we trust to pierce their boasted phalanx. Be not deceived, my friendsâye are brave men, And have brave men to cope with!âvictory Must here be sweated for, even till the drops Do turn to crimson. A Roman Officer enters. Officer. To Cymbeline I bear important greeting, From the proconsul, Lucius. Cymb. Speak his purpose. Officer. He bade me say, that Rome disdains to conquer By means that honour cannot warrantâRead. [Gives a pacquet. Cymb. What's here?âOur consort and her son conspired Against our state and person?âTreason, treason! This was a bosom'd stingâAlas, my children! Then ye were wrong'dâO, my lost Imogen! My son, my shield, my banish'd Leonatus!â Tell me, brave soldier, as thou art a Roman, Does Leonatus draw his sword for CÃ¦sar? Officer. No. He refused to lend his arm to Rome, And, with averted action, thrust away The proffer'd crown of Britain. Cymb. That he were here! that I might wash his truth With tears of kind contritionâTell your general We would embrace his worth, on any terms, Save of our country's freedomâbut, for that, For that we grapple, to our last of life, With arms of rival honourâFollow friends, I lead you to the onset. [Exeunt. SCENE VIII. Drums and Trumpets. Noise of Battle without. British Soldiers and Officers pass over the Stage. 1st Offi. The King's engaged alreadyâup, for shame! Up to your fellows. 2d Offi. Forward, countrymen, To death, or conquest, haste!â [Exeunt. Noise of Battle continues. Several Britons return as in flight, with Officers. Offic. All's lostâthe King is takenâAll is over, And Britain is no more!âShift for your livesâ SCENE IX. Enter Leonatus and Bellarius. Leon. Stay, Britons, turnâShame, shame!âBy great Andate, Who comes upon me, rushes on a death More sure than Rome can giveâStay, stay, I charge ye. Ye stand amazedâbehold, 'tis Iâyour general, Your Leonatus!âTurnâfor shameâfor honourâ Your wives, your infantsâfor posterity, To latest timesâfor Libertyâfor Britain! 'Tis I, your Leonatus leads you on, Against the power and insolence of Romeâ Against the worldâfor Liberty, for Britain!â Follow me, friends!â All. A Leonatus, a Leonatus! Liberty, and Leonatus!â [Exeunt shouting. SCENE X. Noise of Battle continues. Several Romans return, as retreating from the Britons; Clodio following. Clod. How the day is turn'd! And conquest, in an instant, strangely wrung Out of our very graspâStand, Romans, stand. For honour, for your ancient name, return! Let me prevailâ [Exit with them, endeavouring to stop them. SCENE XI. Leonatus enters. Leon. In vain I seek for death, among the thickest, Where the field burnsâthe spectre flies me still, As tho' he held me for his foeâ Clodio re-enters. How, Clodio! By the gods, welcomeâNay, no shrinking, Clodioâ The time of reckoning's come!â Clod. I sought thee not. But since thou crossest meâaltho' thou wert The genuine son of Mars and dread Bellona, I front theeâthus. Leon. And, with my weapon's wind, Thus do I win thee. [Clodio falls. Clod. Curses blast thine arm, Triumphant savage! for it has awaked me From a long dream of greatnessâTell me, Briton, How hast thou dealt with Imogen? Leon. Dispatch'd her. Clod. Then I'm reveng'd!âand I will wring thy soul, With tortures worse than deathâThy Imogen Was guiltless. Leon. How?â Clod. The heavenly light, less chaste! I got myself convey'd into her chamber In a gay coffer, sent, as I pretended, With precious ware from CÃ¦sar; and, at midnight, Even, while the simple, sleeping innocent, Dreamt of her Leonatus, I did mark The chamber; and, in stealing that same bracelet, Spied the rich mole that stung thee into madness. Fool, ideot, doltâ Who had the jewel of the universe, Yet cast it from thee!â Leon. O fiend, without a fellow!âdamn'd, damn'd Clodio; A depth, below all bottom, damn'd!âHope not That death shall snatch thee from my vengeanceâNoâ Even, in mid plunge, I'll seize thy shrinking soul, And it shall be my endless Heaven, to tear, And torture thee for ever.âThou hell-tyger, Thy pangs are not half strong enough!âThus, thus, And thusâ [Stabbing him. Clod. Hold, holdâOhâCursesâcurses catch Thee, and the fiends that gave thee forceâOhâ [Dies. Leon. And now, to follow!â [Turns the sword to his breast. SoftâIf death should be To cease from thought, and, therein, from the rack On which my soul is stretch'd; how then is Imogen Avenged?âor how may my own wrath be wreak'd Against myself, on whom I swear to wage War without truce, for ever? Fool, fool, fool! To credit even these eyes, where, against proof, Her truth was demonstration.âO, my love, Were my guilt greater than e'er call'd for justice, The loss of thee were penal, beyond all That justice could inflict!âand have I caus'd That loss?âAvenge her, Heaven and hell!ârend, rack me! Multiply pains on pains!âO, rose of beauty, How art thou croptâhow faded from amidst The garden of the world, now waste! And shall I never, never, never more Behold thee, Imogen!ânor hear the voice, That spoke soft tunings to my soulânor see That aspect, which arose upon the morning In a new day of comforts, shedding peace And joy around?â [Exit. SCENE XII. Drums and Trumpets. Enter Cymbeline, Bellarius, &amp;c. Cymb. A Briton, art thou? Bell. Yes, so please my liege; A Cambro-Briton, and my name Bellariusâ Unworthy further note. Cymb. Whoe'er thou art, Henceforth, my friend and brother, share my power And bosom confidence. Bell. You far o'er rate My scantiness of merit. Cymb. Noâthy works Proclaim thy worth aloudâand I have found Thy friendship in the rescue which thou brought'st me From the strong gripe of Rome. A friend as thou art, Is the best gift of Heaven, a second self!â Receive me, thenâI fly into thine arms From bosom'd treasons, which I fondly cherish'd In the curs'd venture of a second bed. [Embrace. Did ye not say, that my victorious son, My Leonatus was at hand? 1st Lord. We did. Even now, we all beheld, when, in the instant That conquest was assured, he vanish'd. Cymb. YesâI knew, I knew, It was some godâ'twas Victory, herself, That took his glorious likenessâI beheld him As lightning from the eastâhe shot upon themâ I saw their firmest phalanx shake, throughout, And wither at his presence. Bell. Some few hours Before the battle, he became my guest. I held him, first, for somewhat more than mortal; And, as he spoke, I felt, I know not what Of force and fond emotion, stir me inward, And knit my soul to his. Cymb. Prepare we, then, One hundred of the noblest Roman captives To be, with grateful incense, offer'd up On the triumphant altar of Andateâ So shall her force our future arms await; And, with like favour, guard the British state.

Hell is not hot enoughâHold, hold meâwhere, Where am I hurried round and round?âstopâfixâ Impale meâfor I cannot bear this spinâ This whirlwind of the brainâ Cymb. She faintsâsupport, And bear her in.â [To her women. Queen. Ohâ Pull not so hardâthe jointsâthe panting cords, Rack'd to a fibre!âNature cannot bear This sundering from herselfâthis horrid rending! Thereâtake my limbsâmy vitalsâ To the four winds, dispers'dâOhâ [Dies. Cymb. With what a suddenness, the flaming red Is turn'd to livid!âBear her to her chamberâ O, my sole friend, how poor a thing is kingship, When shorn of every social name that gives Domestic feeling or support!âthou art, now, The only good that's leftâI'll to the temple, And ask the gods, for which of my mistreadings, These ills are come upon me. [Exeunt. SCENE IV. The Inside of the Temple of Andate. Priestess and Imogen enter. Priest. And sent his man to murder thee?â Imog. What could he less?âHad I an hundred lives, They were too little for the bare suspicion Of such a naughtiness!âI fear, I fear.â Priest. Fear not, my daughter, my sweet Imogen! All shall be wellâthy lord, thy Leonatus, Shall be new plighted, in a double bond Of fresh endearment, to thee. Imog. Never, madam! He never can forgiveânever expel The rooted jealousyâWhat, in my chamberâ A ruffian, and at midnight!âthen, to quote Each circumstance of time and placeâconfirm'd Even by my nuptial braceletâand such marks, As ought to have been lock'd from every eye, With bolts of triple steel! Priest. But when he hears The subtle means devisedâ Imog. Ah, sacred lady! Against such proofs, what witness can avail? Not the confession of the lurking fiend, Who plotted my undoing. O, I am Distracted too to think of what he suffers, For such a falling off!âfor, though he is brave As the bay'd lion; yet he is gentle, too, As is the turtle, lately fledg'd, and peeping Into a new-found world. I feelâand to Your ear I will confide itâhad I but The twentieth part the cause to think he had given My rights in his loved person to anotherâ I feel, I could not bear it. Priest. Kindest, truest, Loveliest, and best beloved, my child, my Imogenâ Mine by fond ties, that must not, yet, be told! Peace to thy gentle heartâall shall be whole; Trust me, it shall. A Priest enters. Priest. Bright emblem of our goddess, sacred lady! The rites are all prepared; a hundred victims, With fillets and fresh garlands, duely bound, Wait to be offer'd, in their holy trim, To the great power of Victory. [Exit Priest. Priestess. I comeâ Ill would such scenes, as those, my daughter, suit Thy gentleness of natureâI, who am Bound, by my duty, to the horrid vision, Still shudder at the sight of human blood. Retire, my Imogen. [Exit Imogen. SCENE V. Opens and discovers the inside of the Temple; the Altar of Incense, with the sacred fire, and the Altar of Sacrifice. The Choir and sacred Music at the upper end. The Priests ranged on either hand; a Roman Victim standing behind each Priest, with his hands bound, and adorned with ribbons and garlands. Priestess. Begin your dread solemnities. Symphony of Music, and the Hymn sung by Priests and Priestesses. HYMN. I. Goddess of conflicting arms, Of the field and of the fight, Brazen sounds, and dread alarms, Conquest, slaughter, fear, and flight! II. To thee, triumphant, potent maid, Be our vows and offerings paid! Should domestic guilt displease, Hostile blood shall best appease. Priestess. List nowâThus saith our ancient oracle: When a victim, free to live, Shall his life for others giveâ Human offerings shall, no more, Stain the land with human gore. So says the sentence of two thousand yearsâ But, no such victim comes! Ye know your duty. [To the Priestsâeach of whom seizes his Captive, and draws a poniard, ready to strike. SCENE VI Leonatus enters. Leon. Holdâstop your horrid rites!âRefrain your hands, Ye bloody servants of a barbarous godheadâ Behold, I give those valiant Romans freedom! Come, bring your fire and steel, your racks, and enginesâ On me, alone, be emptied all your stores, All your artillery of deathâI claim, And scorn your utmost efforts. Priest. Ay, this, indeed, This is a victim which the gods might take, In lieu of twenty thousand, and be gainers!â Art thou come, noble youth, to stay the shedding Of human blood in Britain?â Leon. Therefore come. Priest. A voluntary victim?â Leon. Free as air,â Not so invulnerable. Priest. Yet retire. Fearful is deathâ Leon. To those who wish it not. Priest. Aye, but the pangsâ Leon. I have, already, felt More than you can inflict. Priest. And hast thou, then, No nature in thee?âno compunction for Thy friends, thy kinâperhaps, a raving father, Or mother woe-begone?âless pity than Thine executioner, whose eye, their loss Compels to weep compassion. Leon. I claim the sentence of your Oracleâ I have no words to waste. Priest. Unfeeling boy!â Thy will, then, be accomplish'd.âBind him, virgins, And dress him for his death! While some of the Priestesses bind and adorn Leonatus, others join the Priests in the following verses, part in recitative, and part in song. Not in malice, but in love, Dress him as a feast for Jove. Let the melting standers by, Want of weeping kin supply; And with tears, and sighs profound, Fill all the sadden'd air, and wet the mourning ground. [Leonatus is laid on the Altar. A Priest stands over Leonatus with a poniard, while another gives the bowl to Adelaide. Priest. My hand denies its officeâHere, Bonduca, Take thou the bowl of deathâ Bond. We are readyâWhen you like, Give the solemn mandateâ Leon. Strike!â Thunder and Lightning. The Stage is darkened, and the sacred Fire extinguished. Priest. Hold your rash hand!âthe powers are in displeasureâ The Heavens are movedâthe holy fire extinguish'd! Unbind your victimâthis is not the one Our goddess will accept.âHe looks dissatisfiedâ Withdraw, and leave him to my further question. [Exeunt Priests, &amp;c. I do adjure thee, by the power thou worshipp'st, Art thou of earth, or Heaven, or whence?âInform me. Leon. I know not. Priest. No? Leon. Not whenceâbut, what I am, I knowâin nature's work, of no account, And hateful to myself! Priest. Whoe'er thou art, To have thee, thus, alive, and safe, I joy, As though thou wer't new come into the world, My only, and first born. Thy parentsâsayâ Leon. I never knew themâ Priest. O, my foreboding bosom!âNo, that were To be too blest!âWith whom brought up?âO, answerâ Quick, I adjure theeâ Leon. With King Cymbeline, A beggar'd foundling! Priest. And thy name, thy name isâ Leon. Leonatus.â Priest. Mighty goddess!âYesâthou artâthou art My sonâmy LeonatusâO, my child, Child of the tears of twenty mourning years! Till late, I knew not that I had a sonâ The fairest, bravest theme of every tongueâ The hero of our age!âMy Leonatus, My son, my son, my son! [Embraces. Leon. Great nature, powerful goddessâfor a moment, I yield me to thy feelingsâthus, while, thus, I bow beneath the feet of her, who gives me, First, to pronounce the sacred name of mother!â [Kneels. O, mother fair! Thou art the parent of the wretched'st offspring, That ever stain'd mortality with guilt, And made perdition sure! Priest. Fall blessings on thee, Till Heaven can heap no moreâ And blessed thou shalt be. Leon. Noânever, neverâ I have murder'd bliss, have quench'd the light of Britain!â O, Imogen, my love, my life, my wife, My ImogenâO Imogen! Priest. But was she not unchaste? Leon. Pure as the fleece of Heaven, ere yet it falls, And neighbours to corruption. Priest. Peaceâand thou shalt behold herâ [Waves her wand. Beauty, brighter than the morn, Queen of all that's Britain-born, Daughter fair, and daughter dear, Peerless Imogen, appear! SCENE VII. Imogen enters veiled. She throws up her veil. Leonatus stands in silent amazement. Leon. If the grave teems to lifeâ If universal nature, through her works, Could yield another form like thatâ All might not be illusion!â Vision of harmony and light, yet, ere Thou fleetestâthus I fix theeâO, 'tis warm!â It lives, to sense, to rapture! Imog. My love, my lord, my life, my Leonatus! Do I, then, hold thee?âDost thou think me trueâ The seat of memory so fill'd with thee, As leaves no room beside? Leon. If I dwell not Within the regions of creative fancy, It is too much of bliss!âMethinks, I stand Upon a pinnacle, so high in happiness, My eye can see no bottom, whereunto A doubt of this would plunge me. Priest. Hence with doubts And fears, for ever!âYes, ye are the two, In whom I triumph; my blest, happy pair Of priceless pearls, so match'd!âso matchless, too, Save by each other!â Priest enters. Priest. Madam, the King approachesâ Priestess. It is well. Renew the sacred fire.âMy precious children, [Exit Priest. You may withdraw, awhileânot farâthe time Will give a speedy summons. [Imogen and Leonatus retire. SCENE VIII. Cymbeline and Bellarius enter attended. The Priestess drops her Veil. Priest. What would our Cymbeline with great Andate? Cymb. O, sacred dame, by whom the Heavens pronounce Their past and future purposes! you see A man, amid the pride of royalty, Most wretchedâshorn of children, and of kinâ Of all the joys and amities that could Endear existenceâas a lonely oak, Lopp'd of his branches!âTell me, sacred dame, For which of my mistreadings, have these ills Fallen thick and heavy on me? Priest. For a sister! Cymb. The laws did warrant me. Priest. What law can warrant Against the law of Heavenâgreat nature's law, Writ in the bosom, stamp'd in characters Of mercy on the human sense divine, That binds the feeling brotherhood of man, And 'fines him into godhead? Cymb. O pardon! I have greatly sinn'dâthe pride Of novel kingship, and the scorn of shame, So near our throne, thro' her incontinence, Enforced the inhuman act. Priest. Thus saith Andate: Never shalt thou behold the chearing face Of sympathizing friendship, never feel The blest embracements of a daughter's fondness; Till that the melting eye of Adelaide Shall weep, in kind compassion, o'er thy griefs, And wash thy stains away. Cymb. That were too muchâ Too much to hope from her forgiving goodness, If that the gods, by means miraculous, Had yet preserv'd her to meâNever shall These eyes, in mortal sockettings, be blest With such a speculation! Priest. O, behold! [Throws up her veil Cymb. My sister! my lost sister!â Bell. O, the gods!â [Fainting. Cymb. Help here!âmy friend is dying.â [Supporting Bellarius. Priest. Bless'd powers! Through all his guiseâI thinkâ'tis heâ'tis he!â My lord, my ever loved, my long lamented, Lost Leontius! [Embraces. Bell. O, Adelaideâthine armâmy Heaven Has come too sudden on me!â Cymb. Now, indeed, I see it is Leontiusâ'tis the man Who, long since, sought the life he saved so lately. Bell. Not with a traiterous poniard, Cymbelineâ At noon, and hand to hand. Cymb. True, true, my brother! I see the reason, nowâit was resistless. Had you but told me, ere you went to Romeâ Or had our Adelaide confest her spousals With my heart's chosenâwhat a mass of guilt, And grief, had then been spared? Priest. And would you, then, Would you have pardon'd? Cymb. Yes, with that full bounty, That now I claim from both. Bell. My King, my master!â [Kneels. Priest. O, now, indeed, my fond, my new found brother! [Kneels. Cymb. Rise to my arms, my heart!âthere reign, united, And make up all my treasure!â [Embrace. Say, my sister, How came this strange event, this blest reversion Of joys, the last to look for?âSaw I not The flames ascend thy funeral pyre? Priest. You did; But then, a little charitable art, Conveyed me, inward, by clandestine stairs, Just as the flames ascended.âMany a victim, Our pious priestess, in like manner, saved, For the dear meeting, and enraptured clasp, Of fathers, sons, and brothers. Bell. But the pledge, The pledge of our connubial loves, my Adelaideâ What hath befallen? Priest. Our late good priestess, Etheline, Some few nights since, upon her dying couch Confest, she had my new-born babe convey'd, Wrapp'd in rich vestments, to my royal brother, With a fair scroll, expressive of these wordsâ âAndate sends a son to Cymbeline.â Cymb. And was our Leonatus, then, the son Of my sole sister?âLet mine eyes, but once Behold my Imogen and him united, Then, close them, gods, in peace! Priest. Approach, my children, And take the blessing of your King and father. SCENE IX. Leonatus and Imogen enter and kneel to Cymbeline. Cymb. My child, my Imogen!âIt is too muchâ My son, my injured Leonatus too!â Rise, riseâI cannot speakâthis flood of blessings!â Enter my bosom, both.â [Embracing. Priest. See, my Leontius, Behold your glorious son! Bell. Heavens!âI do think, The very sameâSoft, Adelaideâand note If he takes knowledge of me. Leon. What, my host, My holy father here! O, valiant sire, We have had a change, to which Omnipotence Was deem'd unequalâThere you see the Heaven, Whose loss I mourn'd!âhad but your Adelaide, Been added to the blessing! Bell. Art thou, then, That god, to whom we have been paying vows For victory? My son, my child, indeedâ My heart foreknew thee mine!âThere stands our Adelaide, Even thine exulting mother. Leon. O, my father! [Both kneel. Imog. Here, too, my duty bids me bend. Bell. Great power! Grant them, with equal transport, thus to bless The children of their children! An Officer enters. Offic. My liege, Rome's great proconsul, making head To favour his retreating legions, was Beset and taken prisoner. Cymb. Bring him to usâ We owe him many honours. SCENE X. Lucius brought in bound, attended by Roman and British Chiefs. Leon. What, my friend In bondage?âO, indignity to honour, To virtue!âTruest nobleness, thus let me Unbind my country's shame!âThou art free, my Lucius, Free, as at Rome, and full as well affected. Command in Britain, task us to thy will In all thingsâsave, such bonds as these! [Casting away the shackles. Lucius. O, great In goodness, as in glory!âI rejoice In the high fortunes of my Leonatus, Though at the cost of Rome. Cymb. Lucius, in estimation of thy virtues, We give, to every Roman captive, freedom; With truce and entertainment to thy legions, While they remain in Britain.âNext, to CÃ¦sar We shall appoint a special embassy, With twice the value of his late demandâ But, not as tribute, Lucius! Leon. No, my friend!â Wherefore should Rome from others wrest that Liberty, Which, for herself, she prizes more than life? From us she must notâNoâthe gods have given To Britain, independence on all lands By her enfolding waters, her wide field Of future empire!âO, my mother's spirit Swells my prophetic breastâI see the sails Of Britain spread, from east to west, their wings Of wide protection!âHow the nations flock Beneath them!âThis, indeed, is true dominionâ To humble pride, and to subdue oppression; To lift the fallen, and to sustain the weak; To bind a willing world with her beneficence; And wide, as rolling waves, or wafting wind, Reign, the requested mistress of mankind!</field>
