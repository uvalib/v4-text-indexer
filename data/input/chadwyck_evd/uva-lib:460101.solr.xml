      <field name="fulltext">THE ANDRIAN; There is much controversy among the Criticks, whether the Andrian was the first play, which Terence produced, or only the first of those which have come down to our times. Donatus positively asserts it to be our author's first production, and adds that the favourable reception it met with, encouraged him to go on in writing for the Stage. He tells us also that this Piece was entitled “The Andrian of Terence,” and not “Terence's Andrian,” according to the custom of the Romans, who placed the name of the Play first, if it was written by an author, yet unknown in the Theatrical world, but placed the author's name first in the title, if it was one already celebrated. Madam Dacier is of a contrary opinion, and thinks that the introductory lines of the Prologue make it evident that Terence had written before. These inquiries are little more that mere matter of curiosity. For my part, I am rather inclined to the opinion of Donatus. The objections of Lavinius, which Terence in his Prologue endeavours to refute, are entirely confined to this play; and that it was possible for Lavinius to have seen the manuscript before the representation is evident from the Prologue to the Eunuch, where Terence directly charges that circumstance to his adversary. The concluding lines of the Prologue speak the language of an author, new in the Drama, much stronger than those in the beginning denote his having written before. It may be remembered also, that Terence was no more than 27 years of age at the time of the first representation of this comedy. Both the English and French Theatres have borrowed the Fable of this Play. Sir Richard Steele has raised on that foundation his Comedy of the Conscious Lovers; and Baron has adopted even the Title. It is proposed to throw out some observations on each of these pieces, and to compare them with Terence's comedy, in the course of these notes.</field>

A short extract from Donatus will serve to give some explanation of the phrases used in the above title. “They were acted to Flutes equal or unequal, right or left-handed. The Right-handed, or Lydian, by their grave tone, denounced the serious stile of the comedy. The Left-handed, or Tyrian, by their light sharp sound, denoted the vivacity of the piece. But when the play was said to be acted to both Right and Left-handed, it denoted it to be Serio-Comick. composed for Equal Flutes, Right and Left-handed, by Flaccus, Freedman to Claudius: It is wholly Grecian: That is, that species of Comedy, which was called Palliata; in which the Habits, Manners, and Arguments, were all Græcian.

      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. The Bard, when first he gave his mind to write, Thought it his only business, that his Plays Shou'd please the people: But it now falls out, He finds, much otherwise, and wastes, perforce, His time in writing Prologues; not to tell The argument, but to refute the slanders Broach'd by the malice of an older Bard. This old Arch-adversary of Terence was, according to Donatus, Lucius Lavinius; but, according to Madam Dacier, Luscius Lanuvinus. And mark what vices he is charg'd withall! Menander wrote the Andrian and Perinthian: From this account it is plain, that Terence did not in this play weave two different stories of Menander together in that vicious manner which is generally imputed to him: but that the argument of these two plays being nearly the same, Terence having pitched upon the Andrian for the Groundwork of his Fable, enriched it with such parts of the Perinthian, as naturally fell in with that plan. We are told by Donatus, that the first scene of our Author's Andrian, is almost a literal translation of the first scene of the Perinthian of Menander, in which the Old Man discoursed with his wife, just as Simo does with Sosia. In the Andrian of Menander the Old Man opened with a soliloquy. The Perinthian, as well as the Andrian, took its name from the place the woman came from; viz. Perinthus, a town of Thrace. Know one, and you know both; in argument Less diff'rent than in sentiment and stile. What suited with the Andrian he confesses From the Perinthian he transferr'd, and us'd For his: and this it is these sland'rers blame, Proving by deep and learned disputation, That Fables shou'd not be contaminated. Troth! all their knowledge is they nothing know: Who, blaming him, blame These poets are not mentioned here in exact chronological order, Ennius being elder than Plautus. The first authors, who brought a regular play on the Roman stage, is said to have been Livius Andronicus, about the year of Rome 510, and one year before the birth of Ennius. Five years after the representation of the first play of Andronicus, or as some say nine, Nævius wrote for the stage. Then followed Ennius, Plautus, Pacuvius, Cæcilius, Porcius Licinius, Terence, and his cotemporary and adversary Lucius Lavinius, Accius, Afranius, &amp;c. Of all these, many of whom were very eminent writers, we have scarce any remains, except of Plautus and Terence: and what is still more to be lamented, the inestimable Greek Authors, whose writings were the rich source, whence they drew their fable, characters, &amp;c. are also irrecoverably lost. Nævius, Plautus, Ennius, Whose great example is his precedent; Whose negligence he'd wish to emulate Rather than their dark diligence. Henceforth, Let them, I give them warning, be at peace, And cease to rail, lest they be made to know Their own misdeeds. Be favourable! sit With equal mind, and hear our play; that hence Ye may conclude, what hope to entertain, The comedies he may hereafter write Shall merit approbation or contempt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. SIMO, SOSIA, and Servants with Provisions. Simo. Carry those things in: go! [Ex. Servants. The want of marginal directions, however trifling they may at first sight appear, has occasioned, as it necessarily must, much confusion and obscurity in several passages of the antient Dramatick Writers: and is a defect in the manuscripts, and old editions of those authors in the learned languages, which has in vain been attempted to be supplied by long notes of laborious commentators, and delineations of the figures of the characters employed in each scene. This simple method of illustrating the dialogue, and rendering it clear and intelligible to the most ordinary reader, I propose to persue throughout this translation: And I cannot better enforce the utility of this practice, than by few extracts from a very ingenious treatise on Dramatick Poetry, written in French by Mons. Diderot, and annext to his Play, called the Father of a Family. “The Pantomime is a part of the Drama, to which the author ought to pay the most serious attention: for if it is not always present to him, he can neither begin, nor conduct, nor end a scene according to truth and nature; and the action should frequently be written down instead of dialogue. “The Pantomime should be written down, whenever it creates a picture; whenever it gives energy, or clearness, or connection to the Dialogue; whenever it paints character; whenever it consists in a delicate play, which the reader cannot himself supply; whenever it stands in the place of an answer; and almost always at the beginning of a scene. “Whether a poet has written down the Pantomime or not, it is easy to discover at first sight, whether he has composed after it. The conduct of the piece will not be the same; the scenes will have another turn; the Dialogue will relish of it.” Moliere, as this ingenious Critick observes, has always written down the Pantomime, (as he phrases it) and Terence seems plainly to have had it always in his view, and to have paid a constant attention to it in his compositions, though he has not set it down in words.] Sosia, come here; A Word with you! Sosia. I understand: that these Be ta'en due care of. Nempe ut curentur recte hæc. Madam Dacier will have it that Simo here makes use of a kitchen-term in the word curentur. I believe it rather means to take care of any thing generally; and at the conclusion of this very scene, Sosia uses the word again speaking of things very foreign to cookery. Sat est, Curabo.” Simo. Quite another thing. Sosia. What can my art do more for you? Simo. This business Needs not that art; but those good qualities, Which I have ever known abide in you, Fidelity and secrecy. Sosia. I wait Your pleasure. Simo. Since I bought you, from a boy How just and mild a servitude you've pass'd With me, you're conscious: from a purchas'd slave I made you free, because you serv'd me freely: The greatest recompence I cou'd bestow. Sosia. I do remember. Simo. Nor do I repent. Sosia. If I have ever done, or now do aught That's pleasing to you, Simo, I am glad, And thankful that you hold my Service good. And yet this troubles me: for this detail, Forcing your kindness on my memory, Seems to reproach me of ingratitude. There is a beautiful passage in the Duke of Milan of Massinger very similar to the above. The situations of the persons are somewhat alike, Sforza being on the point of opening his mind to Francisco. The English Poet has with great address transferred the sentiment from the inferior to the superior character, which certainly adds to its delicacy. Sforza. —I have ever found you true and thankful, Which makes me love the building I have rais'd, In your advancement; and repent no grace, I have conferr'd upon you: And, believe me, Tho' now I should repeat my favours to you, It is not to upbraid you; but to tell you, I find you're worthy of them, in your love And service to me. Oh tell me then at once, what wou'd you? Sir! Simo. I will; and this I must advise you first: The nuptial you suppose preparing now, Is all unreal. Sosia. Why pretend it then? Simo. You shall hear all from first to last: “Terence stands alone in every thing, but especially in his narrations. It is a pure and transparent stream which flows always evenly, and takes neither swiftness nor noise but that which it derives from its course and the ground it runs over. No wit, no display of sentiment, not a sentence that wears an epigrammatical air, none of those definitions always out of place, except in Nicole or Rochefoucauld. When he generalizes a maxim, it is in so simple and popular a manner, you would believe it to be a common proverb which he has quoted: Nothing but what belongs to the subject. I have read this poet over with attention; there are in him no superfluous scenes, nor any thing superfluous in the scenes.” Diderot. This being the first narration in our author, and exceedingly beautiful, I could not help transcribing the foregoing passage from the French Treatise above-mentioned. The narrations in the Greek Tragedies have been long and justly admired; and from this and many other parts of Terence, taken from Greek authors, we may fairly conclude that their Comedies were equally excellent in that particular. and thus The conduct of my son, my own intent, And what part you're to act, you'll know at once. For my son, Sosia, now to manhood grown, Postquam excessit ex Ephebis. The Ephebia was the first stage of youth, and youth the last stage of boyhood. Donatus. Had freer scope of living: for before How might you know, or how indeed divine His disposition, good or ill, while youth, Fear, and a master, all constrain'd him? Sosia. True. Simo. Though most, as is the bent of youth, apply Their mind to some one object, horses, hounds, Or to the study of philosophy; It was at that age that the Greeks applied themselves to the study of philosophy, and chose out some particular sect, to which they attached themselves. Plato's Dialogues give us sufficient light into that custom. Dacier. Yet none of these, beyond the rest, did he Persue; and yet, in moderation, all. I was o'erjoy'd. Sosia. And not without good cause. For this I hold to be the Golden Rule Of Life, Too much of one Thing's good for nothing. No quid nimis. A sentiment not unbecoming a servant, because it is common, and is therefore not put into the mouth of the master. Donatus. Though the Commentators are full of admiration of this golden saying, “Do nothing to excess,” yet it is plain that Terence introduces it here as a characteristick sentiment. Sosia is a dealer in old sayings. The very next time he opens his mouth, he utters another. I thought it necessary therefore, for the sake of the preservation of character, to translate this antient proverb by one of our own, though the modern maxim is not exprest with equal elegance. Simo. So did he shape his life to bear himself With ease and frank good-humour unto all; Mixt in what company soe'er, to them He wholly did resign himself; and join'd In their persuits, opposing nobody, Nor e'er assuming to himself: and thus With ease, and free from envy, may you gain Praise, and conciliate friends. Sosia. He rul'd his life By prudent maxims: for, as times go now, Compliance raises friends, and truth breeds hate. Simo. Meanwhile, 'tis now about three years ago, The mention of this distance of time is certainly artful, as it affords time for all the events, previous to the opening of the piece, to have happened with the strictest probability. The comment of Donatus on this passage is curious. The author hath artfully said three years, when he might have given a longer or a shorter period. Since it is probable that the woman might have lived modestly one year; set up the trade, the next; and died, the third. In the first year, therefore, Pamphilus knew nothing of the family of Chrysis; in the second, he became acquainted with Glycerium; and in the third, Glycerium marries Pamphilus, and finds her parents. Donatus. A certain woman from the isle of Andros, Came o'er to settle in this neighbourhood, By poverty and cruel kindred driv'n: Handsome and young. Sosia. Ah! I begin to fear Some mischief from this Andrian. Simo. At first Modest and thriftily, tho' poor, she liv'd, It is absolutely necessary that the reputation of Glycerium should be supposed to be spotless and unblemished: and as she could never be made an honest woman, if it were not clear that she was so before marriage, Chrysis, with whom she lived, is partly to be defended, partly to be praised; whom although it is necessary to confess to be a courtezan, yet her behaviour is rendered as excusable as such a circumstance will admit. Donatus. With her own hands a homely livelihood Scarce earning from the distaff and the loom. But when a lover came, with promis'd gold, Another, and another, as the mind Falls easily from labour to delight, She took their offers, and set up the trade. They, who were then her chief gallants, by chance Drew thither, as oft happens with young men, My son to join their company. So, so! Said I within myself, he's smit! he has it! Captus est, habet. Terms taken from the Gladiators. Dacier. And in the morning as I saw their servants Run to and fro, I'd often call, Here, Boy! Prithee now, who had Chrysis yesterday? The name of this same Andrian. Sosia. I take you. Simo. Phædrus they said, Clinia, or Niceratus, For all these three then follow'd her.—Well, well, But what of Pamphilus?—Of Pamphilus! He supt, and paid his reck'ning.—I was glad. Another day I made the like enquiry, But still found nothing touching Pamphilus. Thus I believ'd his virtue prov'd, and hence Thought him a miracle of continence: For he who struggles with such spirits, yet Holds in that commerce an unshaken mind, May well be trusted with the governance Of his own conduct. Nor was I alone Delighted with his life, There is a beautiful sentiment uttered by Manoa in the Samson Agonistes of Milton, which seems to be partly borrowed from this passage in our author. —I gain'd a son, And such a son, as all men hail'd me happy; Who would be now a Father in my stead! but all the world With one accord said all good things, and prais'd My happy fortunes, who possest a son So good, so lib'rally dispos'd.—In short Chremes, seduc'd by this fine character, Came of his own accord, to offer me His only daughter with a handsome portion In marriage with my son. I lik'd the match; Betroth'd my son; and this was pitch'd upon, By joint agreement, for the Wedding-Day. Sosia. And what prevents it's being so? Simo. I'll tell you. In a few days, the treaty still on foot, This neighbour Chrysis dies. Sosia. In happy hour: Happy for you! I was afraid of Chrysis. Simo. My son, on this event, was often there With those who were the late gallants of Chrysis; Assisted to prepare the funeral, Ever condol'd, and sometimes wept with them. This pleas'd me then; for in myself I thought, 'Tis strange, the Criticks have never discovered a similar sentiment to this in Shakespeare. When Valentine in Twelfth-Night reports the inconquerable grief of Olivia for the loss of a brother, the Duke observes upon it, Oh, she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of love but to a brother, How will She love, when the rich golden shaft, Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else That live in her? Common sense directs us, for the most part, to regard Resemblances in great writers, not as the pilferings, or frugal acquisitions of needy art, but as the honest fruits of Genius, the free and liberal bounties of unenvying Nature. Hurd's Discourse on Poetical Imitation. Since merely for a small acquaintance-sake He takes this woman's death so nearly, what If he himself had lov'd? What wou'd he feel For me, his father? All these things, I thought, Were but the tokens and the offices Of a humane and tender disposition. In short, on his account, e'en I myself A complaisant father, to go to the funeral of a courtezan, merely to oblige his son. Cooke. Attend the funeral, suspecting yet No harm. Sosia. And what— Simo. You shall hear all. The Corpse Born forth, we follow: when among the women, Attending there, I chanc'd to cast my eyes Upon one girl, in form— Sosia. Not bad, perhaps.— Simo. And look; so modest, and so beauteous, Sosia! That nothing cou'd exceed it. As she seem'd To grieve beyond the rest; and as her air Appear'd more liberal and ingenuous, I went, and ask'd her women, who she was. Sister, they said, to Chrysis: when at once It struck my mind; So! so! the secret's out; Hence were those tears, and hence all that compassion! Sosia. Alas! I fear how this affair will end! Simo. Meanwhile the funeral proceeds: we follow; Come to the sepulchre: the Body's plac'd Upon the pile, lamented: Whereupon This Sister, I was speaking of, all wild, Ran to the flames with peril of her life. Then! there! the frighted Pamphilus betrays His well-dissembled and long-hidden love: Runs up, and takes her round the waist, and cries, Oh my Glycerium! what is it you do? Why, why endeavour to destroy yourself? Then she, in such a manner, that you thence Might easily perceive their long, long, love, Threw herself back into his arms, and wept, Oh how familiarly! Sosia. How say you! Simo. I Return in anger thence, and hurt at heart, Yet had not cause sufficient for reproof. What have I done? he'd say: or how deserv'd Reproach? or how offended, Father?—Her, Who meant to cast herself into the flames, I stopt. A fair excuse! Sosia. You're in the right: Nothing can mark the flat simplicity of Sosia's character stronger than the insipidity of this speech. For him, who sav'd a life, if you reprove, What will you do to him that offers wrong? Simo. Chremes next day came open-mouth'd to me: Oh monstrous! he had found that Pamphilus Was married to this Stranger-Woman. The Greeks and Romans made use of this expression to signify a Courtezan; and I believe they borrowed that term from the people of the east; as we find it used in that sense in the books of the Old Testament. Dacier. Donatus seems to think the word used here merely as a contemptuous expression. I Deny the fact most steadily, and he As steadily insists. In short we part On such bad terms, as let me understand He wou'd refuse his daughter. Sosia. Did not you Then take your son to task? Simo. Not even this Appear'd sufficient for reproof. Sosia. How so? Simo. Father, (he might have said) You have, you know, Prescrib'd a term to all these things yourself. The time is near at hand, when I must live According to the humour of another. Meanwhile, permit me now to please my own! Sosia. What cause remains to chide him then? Simo. If he Refuses, on account of this amour, To take a wife, such obstinate denial Must be considered as his first offence. Wherefore I now, from this mock-nuptial, Endeavour to draw real cause to chide: And that same rascal Davus, if he's plotting, That he may let his counsel run to waste, Now, when his knaveries can do no harm: Who, I believe, with all his might and main Will strive to cross my purposes; and that More to plague me, than to oblige my son. Sosia. Why so? Simo. Why so! Bad mind, bad heart: Mala mens, malus animus. Animus, the heart, conceives the bad actions, and Mens, the mind, devises the means of carrying them into execution. Dacier. But if I catch him at his tricks!—But what need words? —If, as I wish it may, it shou'd appear That Pamphilus objects not to the match, Chremes remains to be prevail'd upon, And will, I hope, consent. 'Tis now your place To counterfeit these nuptials cunningly; To frighten Davus; and observe my son, What he's about, what plots they hatch together. Sosia. Enough; I'll take due care. Let's now go in! Simo. Go first; I'll follow you. [Exit Sosia. Here we take our last leave of Sosia, who is in the language of the commentators, a Protatick Personage, that is, as Donatus explains it, one who appears only once in the beginning (the Protasis) of the piece, for the sake of unfolding the argument, and is never seen again in any part of the play. The narration being ended, says Donatus, the character of Sosia is no longer necessary. He therefore departs, and leaves Simo alone to carry on the action. With all due deference to the antients, I cannot help thinking this method, if too constantly practised, as I think it is in our author, rather inartificial. Narration, however beautiful, is certainly the deadest part of theatrical compositions; it is indeed, strictly speaking, scarce Dramatick, and strikes the least in the representation: and the too frequent introduction of a character, to whom a principal person in the Fable is to relate in confidence the circumstances previous to the opening of the play, is surely too direct a manner of conveying that information to the audience. Every thing of this nature should come obliquely, fall in a manner by accident, or be drawn, as it were, perforce, from the parties concerned, in the course of the action: a practice, which if reckoned highly beautiful in Epick, may be almost set down as absolutely necessary in Dramatick Poetry. It is, however, more adviseable even to seem tedious, than to hazard being obscure. Terence certainly opens his plays with great address, and assigns a probable reason for one of the parties being so communicative to the other; and yet it is too plain that this narration is made merely for the sake of the audience, since there never was a duller hearer than Master Sosia, and it never appears in the sequel of the Play, that Simo's instructions to him are of the least use to frighten Davus, or work upon Pamphilus. Yet even this Protatick Personage is one of the instances of Terence's art, since it was often usual in the Roman Comedy, as may be seen even in Plautus, to make the relation of the argument the express office of the Prologue. Sir Richard Steele has opened the Conscious Lovers in direct imitation of the Andrian, but has unfolded the argument with much less art, as will perhaps appear in the course of the notes on this act. In this place it is sufficient to observe, that the delineation of the characters in the English author is infinitely inferior to that of those in the Roman. Simo is the most finished character in the play. Sir John Bevil, I fear, is but an insignificant personage. Humphry, while he has all the plainness and dullness of Sosia, possesses neither his fidelity nor secrecy; for he goes between the father and the son, and in some measure betrays both. Beyond all doubt My son's averse to take a wife: I saw How frighten'd Davus was, but even now, When he was told a nuptial was preparing. But here he comes. SCENE II. Enter DAVUS. Sir Richard Steele has modernized the characters of Davus and Mysis with great elegance and humour in his sprightly Footman and Chambermaid, Tom and Phillis. Davus to himself.] I thought 'twere wonderful If this affair went off so easily; And dreaded where my master's great good-humour Wou'd end at last: Who, after he perceiv'd The Lady was refus'd, ne'er said a word To any of us, nor e'er took it ill. Simo, behind.] But now he will; to your cost too, I warrant you! Davus. This was his scheme; to lead us by the nose In a false dream of joy; then all agape With hope, even then that we were most secure, To have o'erwhelm'd us, nor have giv'n us time To cast about which way to break the match. Cunning old Gentleman! Simo. What says the Rogue? Davus. My master, and I did not see him! Simo. Davus! Davus. Well! what now? [pretending not to see him. Simo. Here! this way! Davus. What can he want? [to himself. Simo, overhearing.] What say you? Davus. Upon what? Sir! Simo. Upon what! The world reports that my son keeps a mistress. Davus. Oh, to be sure, the world cares much for that. Simo. D'ye mind what I say? Sirrah! Davus. Nothing more, Sir. Simo. But for me now to dive into these matters May seem perhaps like too severe a father: For all his youthful pranks concern not me. While 'twas in season, he had my free leave To take his swing of pleasure. But to-day Brings on another stage of life, and asks For other manners: wherefore I desire, Or, if you please, I do beseech you, Davus, To set him right again. Davus. What means all this? Simo. All, who are fond of mistresses, dislike The thoughts of matrimony. Davus. So they say. Simo. And then, if such a person entertains An evil counsellor in those affairs, He tampers with the mind, and makes bad worse. Davus. Troth, I don't comprehend one word of this. Simo. No? Davus. No. I'm Davus, and not Oedipus. Simo. Then for the rest I have to say to you, You chuse I should speak plainly. Davus. By all means. Simo. If I discover then, that in this match You get to your dog's tricks to break it off, Or try to shew how shrewd a rogue you are, I'll have you beat to mummy, and then thrown Te in pistrinum, Dave, dedam. The prison mentioned here, and in many other passages of our author, was a kind of House of Correction for slaves, to which they were sent to grind corn, as disorderly persons are made to beat hemp in our Bridewell. In prison, Sirrah! upon this condition, That when I take you out again, I swear To grind there in your stead. D'ye take me now? Or don't you understand this neither? Davus. Clearly. You have spoke out at last: the very thing! Quite plain and home; and nothing round about. Simo. I could excuse your tricks in any thing, Rather than this. Davus. Good words! I beg of you. Simo. You laugh at me: well, well!—I give you warning, That you do nothing rashly, nor pretend You was not advertis'd of this—Take heed! [Exit. SCENE III. DAVUS. This, says Donatus, is a short and comick deliberation, calculated to excite the attention of the audience to the impending events; artfully relating part of the argument, but in order to prepare the events without anticipating them, representing the circumstances of the story as fabulous; and in order to enliven it, passing from dry narration to mimickry. How much more artful is the conduct of Terence in this place than that of Sir Richard Steele in the Conscious Lovers, who besides the long narration, with which the play opens, has obliged the patient Humphrey to hear a second story, with which he has burthened the conclusion of his first act, from young Bevil. Troth, Davus, 'tis high time to look about you; No room for sloth, as far as I can sound The sentiments of our old gentleman About this marriage; which if not fought off, And cunningly, spoils me, or my poor master. I know not what to do; nor can resolve To help the son, or to obey the father. If I desert poor Pamphilus, alas! I tremble for his life; if I assist him, I dread his father's threats: a shrewd old Cuff, Not easily deceiv'd. For first of all, He knows of this amour; and watches me With jealous eyes, lest I devise some trick To break the match. If he discovers it, Woe to poor Davus! nay, if he's inclin'd To punish me, he'll seize on some pretence To throw me into prison, right or wrong. Another mischief is, this Andrian, Mistress or wife, 's with child by Pamphilus. And do but mark their confidence! 'tis sure Inceptio est amentium, haud amantium. A play upon words, impossible to be exactly preserved in the translation. The doatage of mad people, not of lovers. Whate'er she shall bring forth, they have resolv'd Decreverunt tollere. The word tollere strictly signifies to take up, and alludes to the custom of those times. As soon as a child was born, it was laid on the ground; and if the father was willing to educate it, he ordered it to be taken up: but if he said nothing, it was a token signifying that he would have it exposed. Dacier. To educate: and have among themselves Devis'd the strangest story! that Glycerium Is an Athenian citizen. “There was “Once on a time a certain merchant, shipwreckt “Upon the isle of Andros; there he died: “And Chrysis' father took this Orphan-wreck, “Then but an infant, under his protection.” Ridiculous! 'tis all romance to me: And yet the story pleases them. And see! Mysis comes forth. But I must to the Forum The Forum is very frequently spoken of in the Comick authors; and from various passages in which Terence mentions it, it may be collected, that it was a publick place, serving the several purposes of a market, the seat of the Courts of Justice, a publick walk, and an Exchange. To look for Pamphilus, for fear his father Should find him first, and take him unawares. [Exit. SCENE IV. Enter MYSIS. [Speaking to a servant within. I hear, Archillis; I hear what you say: You beg me to bring Lesbia. By my troth That Lesbia is a drunken wretch, hot-headed, Nor worthy to be trusted with a woman In her first labour.—Well, well! she shall come. —Observe how earnest the old Gossip is, [Coming forward. Because this Lesbia is her pot-companion. —Oh grant my mistress, Heav'n, a safe delivery, And let the midwife trespass any where Rather than here!—But what is it I see? Pamphilus all disorder'd: How I fear The cause! I'll wait awhile, that I may know If this commotion means us any ill. SCENE V. The two most beautiful characters in this play, in my opinion, are the Father and Son. It has already been observed how much Sir Richard Steele falls short of Terence in delineating the first; and I must own, though Bevil is plainly the most laboured character in the Conscious Lovers, I think it inferior to Pamphilus. The particular differences in their character I propose to point out in the course of these notes: at present I shall only observe in general, that, of the two, Bevil is the more cool and refined, Pamphilus the more natural and pathetick. PAMPHILUS, MYSIS behind. Pam. Is this well done? or like a man?—Is this The action of a father? Mysis. What's the matter? Pam. Oh all ye Pow'rs of heav'n and earth, what's wrong If this is not so?—If he was determin'd That I to-day should marry, should I not Have had some previous notice?—ought not He To have inform'd me of it long ago? Mysis. Alas! what's this I hear? Pam. And Chremes too, Who had refus'd to trust me with his daughter, Changes his mind, because I change not mine. Id mutavit, quia me immutatum videt. The verb immutare in other Latin authors, and even in other parts of Terence himself, signifies to change: as in the Phormio, Antipho says Non possum immutarier. “I cannot be changed.” But here the sense absolutely requires that immutatum should be rendered NOT changed. Madam Dacier endeavours to reconcile this, according to a conjecture of her father's, by shewing that immutatus stands for immutabilis; as immotus for immobilis, invictus for invincibilis, &amp;c. But these examples do not remove the difficulty; since those participles always bear a negative sense, which immutatus does not: and thence arises all the difficulty. Terence certainly uses the verb immature both negatively and positively, as is plain from this passage and the above passage from the Phormio: and I dare say with strict propriety. In our own language we have instances of the same word bearing two senses directly opposite to each other. The word Let for instance is used in the contradictory meanings of permission and prohibition. The modern acceptation of the word is indeed almost entirely confined to the first sense; though we say even at this day without LET or molestation. Shakespeare in Hamlet, says, I'll make a Ghost of him that lets me. that is, stops, prevents, hinders me, which is directly opposite to the modern use of the word. Can he then be so obstinately bent To tear me from Glycerium? To lose her Is losing life.—Was ever man so crost, So curst as I?—Oh Pow'rs of heav'n and earth! Can I by no means fly from this alliance With Chremes' family?—so oft contemn'd And held in scorn!—all done, concluded all!— Rejected, then recall'd:—and why?—unless, For so I must suspect, Aliquid monstri alunt. Dacier and some others imagine these words to signify some plot that is hatching. Donatus and the commentators on him interpret them as referring to the woman, which is the sense I have followed; and I think the next sentence confirms this interpretation. they breed some monster; Whom as they can obtrude on no one else, They bring to me. Mysis. Alas, alas! this speech Has struck me almost dead with fear. Pam. And then My father!—what to say of him?—Oh shame! A thing of so much consequence to treat So negligently!—For but even now Passing me in the Forum, Pamphilus! To-day's your wedding-day, said He: Prepare; Go, get you home!—This sounded in my ears As if he said, Go, hang yourself!—I stood Confounded. Think you I could speak one word? Or offer an excuse, how weak soe'er? No, I was dumb:—and had I been aware, Should any ask what I'd have done, I would, Rather than this, do any thing.—But now What to resolve upon?—So many cares Entangle me at once, and rend my mind, Pulling it diff'rent ways. My love, compassion, This urgent match, my rev'rence for my father, Who yet has ever been so gentle to me, And held so slack a rein upon my pleasures. —And I oppose him?—Racking thought!—Ah me! I know not what to do. Mysis. Alas, I fear Where this uncertainty will end. 'Twere best He should confer with her; or I at least Speak touching her to him. For while the mind Dum in dubio est animus, paulo momento huc illuc impellitur. Dacier thinks that these words allude to scales, which sense I have adopted in the translation; but I rather think with Donatus that they refer to any great weight, which while it is yet unfixt, and hangs in suspence, is driven by the slightest touch here or there. In the beautiful story of Myrrha in Ovid's Metamorphoses, there is a passage, which the Commentators with great justice suppose to be an imitation of this sentence. —Utque securi, Saucia trabs ingens, ubi plaga novissima restat, Quo cadat, in dubio est, omniq; à parte timetur; Sic animus vario labefactus vulnere nutat Huc levis atq; illuc, momentaq; sumit utroque. Hangs in suspence, a trifle turns the scale. Pam. Who's there? what, Mysis! Save you! Mysis. Save you! Sir. [Coming forwards. Pam. How does she? Mysis. How! opprest with wretchedness. Laborat e dolore. Though the word laborat has tempted Donatus and the rest of the Commentators to suppose that this sentence signified Glycerium's being in labour, I cannot help concurring with Cooke, that it means simply, that she is weighed down with grief. The words immediately subsequent corroborate this interpretation: and at the conclusion of the scene, when Mysis tells him, she is going for a midwife, Pamphilus hurries her away as he would naturally have done here, had he understood by these words, that her mistress was in labour. To-day supremely wretched, as to-day Was formerly appointed for your wedding. And then she fears lest you desert her. Pam. I! Desert her? Can I think on't? or deceive A wretched maid, who trusted to my care Her life and honour! Her, whom I have held Near to my heart, and cherish'd as my wife? Or leave her modest and well-nurtur'd mind Through want to be corrupted? Never, never. Mysis. No doubt, did it depend on you alone; But if constrain'd— Pam. D'ye think me then so vile? Or so ungrateful, so inhuman, savage, Neither long intercourse, nor love, nor shame, Can make me keep my faith? Mysis. I only know That she deserves you should remember her. Pam. I should remember her? Oh, Mysis, Mysis! The words of Chrysis touching my Glycerium Are written in my heart. On her death-bed She call'd me. I approach'd her. You retir'd. We were alone; and Chrysis thus began. My Pamphilus, you see the youth and beauty Of this unhappy maid: and well you know, These are but feeble guardians to preserve Her fortune or her fame. By this right hand I do beseech you, by your better angel, Per Genium tuum. Most editors give Ingenium: but as Bentley observes, this [per Genium] was the most usual way of adjuring; and there is a passage in Horace, plainly imitated from this in our author, where the measure infallibly determines the reading. Quod te per Genium, dextramq; Deosq; Penates, Obsecro, et obtestor. Hor. L. 1. Ep. 7. Cooke. By your tried faith, by her forlorn condition, I do conjure you, put her not away, Nor leave her to distress. If I have ever, As my own brother, lov'd you; or if she Has ever held you dear 'bove all the world, And ever shewn obedience to your will— I do bequeath you to her as a husband, Friend, Guardian, Father: All our little wealth To you I leave, and trust it to your care.— She join'd our hands, and died.—I did receive her, And once receiv'd will keep her. How much more affecting is this speech, than Bevil's dry detail to Humphry of his meeting with Indiana! a detail the more needless and inartificial, as it might with much more propriety and pathos have been entirely reserved for Indiana herself in the scene with her father. Mysis. So we trust. Pam. What make you from her? Mysis. Going for a midwife. Methinks Mysis has loitered a little too much, considering her errand; but perhaps Terence knew, that some women would gossip on the way, though on an affair of life and death. Cooke. This two-edged reflection glancing at once on Terence and the ladies is, I think, very ill-founded. The delay of Mysis, on seeing the emotion of Phamphilus, is very natural; and her artful endeavours to interest his passions in favour of her mistress, are rather marks of her attention, than neglect. Pam. Haste then! and hark, besure take special heed, You mention not a word about the marriage, Lest this too give her pain. Mysis. I understand. The first act of Baron's Andrian is little else than a mere version of this first act of Terence. Its extreme elegance and great superiority to the Prose Translation of Dacier, is a strong proof of the superior excellence and propriety of a Poetical Translation of the works of this author.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. These two characters were not in the works of Menander, but were added to the Fable by Terence, lest Philumena's being left without a husband, on the marriage of Pamphilus to Glycerium, should appear too tragical a circumstance. Donatus. Madam Dacier, after transcribing this remark, adds, that it appears to her to be an observation of great importance to the Theatre, and well worthy our attention. Important as this Dramatick Arcanum may be, it were to be wished that Terence had never found it out, or at least that he had not availed himself of it in the construction of the Andrian. It is plain that the Duplicity of Intrigue did not proceed from the imitation of Menander, since these characters, on which the double plot is founded, were not drawn from the Greek Poet. Charinus and Byrrhia are indeed but poor counterparts, or faint shadows of Pamphilus and Davus; and instead of adding life and vigour to the Fable, rather damp its spirit, and stop the activity of its progress. As to the tragical circumstance of Philumena's having no husband, it seems something like the distress of Prince Prettyman, who thinks it a matter of indifference, whether he shall appear to be the son of a King or a Fisherman, and is only uneasy lest he should be the son of nobody at all. I am much more inclined to the opinion of an ingenious French Critick, whom I have already cited more than once, than to that of Donatus or Madam Dacier. His comment on this under-plot is as follows. “It is almost impossible to conduct two intrigues at a time, without weakening the inrest of both. With what address has Terence interwoven the Amours of Pamphilus and Charinus in the Andrian! But has he done it without inconvenience? At the beginning of the second Act, do we not seem to be entering upon a new piece? and does the fifth conclude in a very interesting manner?” Diderot. It is but justice to Sir Richard Steele to confess, that he has conducted the under-plot in the Conscious Lovers in a much more artful and interesting manner than Terence in the play before us. The part which Myrtle sustains (though not wholly unexceptionable, especially in the last act) is more essential to the Fable, than Charinus in the Andrian. His character also is more separated and distinguished from Bevil than Charinus from Pamphilus, and serves to produce one of the best scenes in the play. CHARINUS, BYRRHIA. Char. How, Byrrhia? Is she to be married, say you, To Pamphilus to-day? Byr. 'Tis even so. Char. How do you know? Byr. I had it even now From Davus at the Forum. Char. Woe is me! Then I'm a wretch indeed: till now my mind Floated 'twixt hope and fear: now, hope remov'd, Stunn'd, and o'erwhelm'd, it sinks beneath its cares. Byr. Nay, prithee Master, since the thing you wish Cannot be had, e'en wish for that which may! Char. I wish for nothing but Philumena. Byr. Ah, how much wiser were it, that you strove To quench this passion, than, with words like these, To fan the fire, and blow it to a flame? Char. How readily do men at ease prescribe To those who're sick at heart! Distrest like me, You would not talk thus. Byr. Well, well, as you please. Char. Ha! I see Pamphilus. I can resolve On any thing, e'er give up all for lost. Byr. What now? Char. I will intreat him, beg, beseech him, Tell him our course of love, and thus perhaps, At least prevail upon him to defer His marriage some few days: meanwhile, I hope, Something may happen. Byr. Ay, that something's nothing. Char. Byrrhia, what think you? Shall I speak to him? Byr. Why not? for tho' you don't obtain your Suit, He will at least imagine you're prepar'd To cuckold him, in case he marries her. Char. Away, you hang-dog, with your base suspicions! SCENE II. Enter PAMPHILUS. Pam. Charinus, save you! Char. Save you, Pamphilus! Imploring comfort, safety, help, and counsel, You see me now before you. Pam. I do lack Myself both help and counsel—But what mean you? Char. Is this your Wedding-day? Pam. Ay, so they say. Char. Ah, Pamphilus, if so, this day You see the last of me. Pam. How so? Char. Ah me! I dare not speak it: prithee tell him, Byrrhia. Byr. Ay, that I will. Pam. What is't? Byr. He is in Love With your Bride, Sir Sponsam hic tuam amat. We have no word exactly answering the sense of Sponsam in this place. The familiar French expression of La Future comes pretty near it. It is, however, I hope, an allowable liberty in familiar conversation to speak of the Lady by the name of the Bride on her wedding-day, though before the performance of the ceremony.. Pam. I faith so am not I. Tell me, Charinus, has ought further past 'Twixt you and her? Char. Ah, no, no. Pam. Wou'd there had! Char. Now by our friendship, by my love, I beg You wou'd not marry her.— Pam. I will endeavour. Char. If that's impossible, or if this match Be grateful to your heart— Pam. My heart! Char. At least Defer it some few days; while I depart That I may not behold it. Pam. Hear, Charinus; It is, I think, scarce honesty in him To look for thanks, who means no favour. I Abhor this marriage, more than you desire it. Char. You have reviv'd me. Pam. Now if you, or He, Your Byrrhia here, can do or think of aught; Act, plot, devise, invent, strive all you can To make her your's; and I'll do all I can That She may not be mine. Char. Enough. Pam. I see Davus, and in good time: for He'll advise What's best to do. Char. But you, you sorry Rogue, [to Byrrhia. Can give me no advice, nor tell me aught, But what it is impertinent to know. Hence, Sirrah, get you gone! Byr. With all my heart. [Exit. SCENE III. Enter DAVUS hastily. Davus. Good Heav'ns, what news I bring! what joyful news! But where shall I find Pamphilus, to drive His fears away, and make him full of Joy? Char. There's something pleases him. Pam. No matter what. He has not heard of our ill fortune yet. Davus. And He, I warrant, if he has been told Of his intended Wedding— Char. Do you hear? Davus. Poor Soul, is running all about the Town In quest of me. But whither shall I go? Or which way run? Char. Why don't you speak to him? Davus. I'll go. Pam. Ho! Davus! Stop, come here! Davus. Who calls? O, Pamphilus! the very man.—Heyday! Charinus too!—Both gentlemen, well met! I've news for both. Pam. I'm ruin'd, Davus. Davus. Hear me! Pam. Undone! Davus. I know your fears. Char. My life's at stake. Davus. Your's I know also. Pam. Matrimony mine. Davus. I know it. Pam. But to-day. Davus. You stun me; Plague! I tell you I know ev'ry thing: You fear [to Charinus. You shou'd not marry her.—You fear you shou'd. [to Pam. Char. The very thing. Pam. The same. Davus. And yet that same Is nothing. Mark! Pam. Nay, rid me of my fear. Davus. I will then. Chremes Won't give his daughter to you. Pam. How d'ye know? Davus. I'm sure of it. Your Father but just now Takes me aside, and tells me 'twas his will, That you shou'd wed to-day; with much beside, Which now I have not leisure to repeat. I, on the instant, hastening to find you, Run to the Forum to inform you of it: There, failing, climb an eminence, look round: No Pamphilus: I light by chance on Byrrhia; Rogo, negat vidisse. Wonderful brevity, and worthy imitation. Donatus. Whoever remembers this Speech, as well as many other little narrations, in the original, will readily concur with the Critick; but whether the imitation recommended is very practicable, or capable of equal elegance in our language, the reader may partly determine from the present and other translations. Enquire; he hadn't seen you. Vext at heart, What's to be done; thought I. Returning thence A doubt arose within me. Ha! bad cheer, The old man melancholy, and a wedding Clapt up so suddenly! This don't agree. Pam. Well, what then? Davus. I betook me instantly To Chremes' house; but thither when I came, Terence has not put this remark into the mouth of Davus without foundation. The House of the Bride was always full, and before the Street-door were Musicians, and those who waited to accompany the Bride. Dacier. Before the door all hush. This tickled me. Pam. You're in the right. Proceed. Davus. I watch'd awhile: Mean time no soul went in, no soul came out; Married women, neighbours, and relations; whose business it was to attend the Lady, whose name (Pronuba) as well as office was much the same as that of the modern Bride-maid. No Matron; in the house no ornament; No note of preparation. I approach'd, Look'd in— Pam. I understand: a potent sign! Davus. Does this seem like a nuptial? Pam. I think not, Davus. Davus. Think not, d'ye say? you don't conceive: The thing is evident. I met beside, As I departed thence, with Chremes' boy, Bearing some potherbs, and a pennyworth Obolo. The Obolus, says Donatus, was a coin of the lowest value. Cooke tells us that the precise worth of it was one penny, farthing, one sixth. Of little fishes for the old man's dinner. Char. I am deliver'd, Davus, by your means, From all my apprehensions of to-day. Davus. And yet you are undone. Char. How so? since Chremes Will not consent to give Philumena To Pamphilus. Davus. Ridiculous! As if, Because the daughter is denied to him, She must of course wed you. Look to it well; Court the old Gentleman thro' friends, apply, Or else— Char. You're right: I will about it strait, Altho' that hope has often fail'd. Farewell. [Exit. SCENE IV. Pam. What means my Father then? why counterfeit? Davus. That I'll explain. If he were angry now, Merely that Chremes has refus'd his Daughter, He'd think himself in fault; and justly too, Before the biass of your mind is known. But granting you refuse her for a Wife, Then all the blame devolves on you, and then Comes all the storm. Pam. What course then shall I take? Shall I submit— Davus. He is your Father, Sir, Whom to oppose were difficult; and then Glycerium's a lone woman; and he'll find Some course, no matter what, to drive her hence. Pam. To drive her hence? Davus. Directly. Pam. Tell me then, Oh tell me, Davus, what were best to do? Davus. Say that you'll marry The reciprocal dissimulation between the Father and Son, in the Fable of this Comedy, is much better managed by our Author than by Sir Richard Steele. The efforts made by each party, in order to accomplish the favourite point, which they severally have in view, very naturally keeps all the characters in motion, and produces many affecting, and pleasant situations. There is too much uniformity in the adventures, as well as character of Bevil, for the vivacity of the Drama. His supposed consent to marry is followed by no consequences, and his honest dissimulation, as he himself calls it, is less reconcileable to the philosophical turn of his character, than to the natural sensibility of Pamphilus; besides that the dissimulation of the latter is palliated by his being almost involuntarily driven into it by the artful instigations of Davus.. Pam. How! Davus. And where's the harm? Pam. Say that I'll marry! Davus. Why not? Pam. Never, never. Davus. Do not refuse! Pam. Persuade not! Davus. Do but mark The consequence. Pam. Divorcement from Glycerium, And marriage with the other. Davus. No such thing. Your father, I suppose, accosts you thus. I'd have you wed to-day;—I will, quoth you: What reason has he to reproach you then? Thus shall you baffle all his settled schemes, And put him to confusion; all the while Secure yourself: for 'tis beyond a doubt That Chremes will refuse his daughter to you; So obstinately too, you need not pause, Or change these measures, lest he change his mind; Say to your father then, that you will wed, That, with the will, he may want cause to chide. But if, deluded by fond hopes, you cry, “No one will wed their daughter to a rake, “A libertine.”—Alas, you're much deceiv'd. For know, your father will redeem some wretch From rags and beggary to be your wife, Rather than see your ruin with Glycerium. But if he thinks you bear an easy mind, He too will grow indiff'rent, and seek out Another match at leisure: the mean while Affairs may take a lucky turn. Pam. D'ye think so? Davus. Beyond all doubt. Pam. See, what you lead me to. Davus. Nay, peace! Pam. I'll say so then. But have a care He knows not of the child, which I've agreed To educate. Davus. Oh confidence! Pam. She drew This promise from me, as a firm assurance That I would not forsake her. Davus. We'll take care. But here's your father: let him not perceive You're melancholy. SCENE V. Enter SIMO at a distance. Simo. I return to see What they're about, or what they meditate. Davus. Now is he sure that you'll refuse to wed. From some dark corner brooding o'er black thoughts He comes, and fancies he has fram'd a speech To disconcert you. See, you keep your ground! Pam. If I can, Davus. Davus. Trust me, Pamphilus, Your father will not change a single word In anger with you, do but say you'll wed. SCENE VI. Enter BYRRHIA behind. Byr. To-day my master bad me leave all else For Pamphilus, and watch how he proceeds, About his marriage; wherefore I have now Hunc venientem sequor. This verse, though in every edition, as Bentley judiciously observes, is certainly spurious: for as Pamphilus has not disappeared since Byrrhia left the stage, he could not say nunc HUNC venientem sequor. If we suppose the line genuine, we must at the same time suppose Terence guilty of a monstrous absurdity. Cooke. Other Commentators have also stumbled at this passage; but if in the words follow'd HIM hither, we suppose HIM [HUNC] to refer to Simo, the whole difficulty is removed: and that the Pronoun does really signify Simo is evident from the very circumstance of Pamphilus never having left the stage since the disappearance of Byrrhia. Simo also is represented as coming on the stage homewards, so that Byrrhia might easily have followed him along the street: and it is evident that Byrrhia does not allude to Pamphilus, from the agreeable surprize which he expresses on seeing him there so opportunely for his purpose. Follow'd the old man hither: yonder too Stands Pamphilus himself, and with him Davus. To business then! Simo. I see them both together. Davus. Now mind. [apart to Pam. Simo. Here, Pamphilus! Davus. Now turn about, As taken unawares. [apart. Pam. Who calls? my father! Davus. Well said! [apart. Simo. It is my pleasure, that to-day, As I have told you once before, you marry. Davus. Now on our part, I fear what he'll reply. [aside. Pam. In that, and all the rest of your commands, I shall be ready to obey you, Sir! Byr. How's that! [overhearing. Davus. Struck dumb. [aside. Byr. What said he? [listening. Simo. You perform Your Duty, when you chearfully comply With my desires. Davus. There! said I not the truth? [apart to Pam. Byr. My master then, so far as I can find, May whistle for a Wife. Simo. Now then go in, That when you're wanted you be found. Pam. I go. [Exit. Byr. Is there no faith in the affairs of men? 'Tis an old saying and a true one too; “Of all Mankind each loves himself the best.” I've seen the Lady; know her beautiful; And therefore sooner pardon Pamphilus, If he had rather win her to his Arms, Than yield her to th'embraces of my master. Donatus observes on this Scene between Byrrhia, Simo, Pamphilus, and Davus, that the Dialogue is sustained by four persons, who have little or no intercourse with each other: so that the Scene is not only in direct contradiction to the precept of Horace excluding a fourth person, but is also otherwise vicious in its construction. Scenes of this kind are, I think, much too frequent in Terence, though indeed the form of the antient Theatre was more adapted to the representation of them than the modern. The multiplicity of speeches aside is also the chief error in his Dialogue, such speeches, though very common in Dramatick writers antient and modern, being always more or less unnatural.—Myrtle's suspicions, grounded on the intelligence drawn from Bevil's servant, are more artfully imagined by the English Poet, than those of Charinus created by employing his servant as a Spy on the actions of Pamphilus. I will go bear these tidings, and receive Much evil treatment for my evil news. [Exit. SCENE VII. Manent SIMO and DAVUS. Davus. Now he supposes I've some trick in hand, And loiter here to practise it on him! Simo. Well, what now, Davus? Davus. Nothing. Simo. Nothing, say you? Davus. Nothing at all. Simo. And yet I look'd for something Davus. Præter spem evenit: sentio: hoc male habet virum. All the commentators and translators have understood this whole line as spoken aside: but as the first part of it is an apt answer to what Simo had said, and in the same stile with the rest of the conversation, that Davus commonly holds with him, I rather think it was intended in reply; to which Davus subjoins the conclusion, as his sly remark aside.—Whether this was certainly the Poet's meaning, it is difficult to determine; but I think that this manner of speaking the line would have the best effect on the Stage. So, I perceive, you did:—This nettles him. [aside. Simo. Can you speak truth? Davus. Most easily. Simo. Say then, Is not this wedding irksome to my Son, From his adventure with the Andrian? Davus. No faith; or if at all, 'twill only be Two or three days' anxiety, you know: Then 'twill be over: for he sees the thing In its true light. Simo. I praise him for't. Davus. While you Restrain'd him not; and while his youth allow'd, 'Tis true he lov'd; and even then by stealth, As wise men ought, and careful of his fame. Now his age calls for matrimony, now To matrimony he inclines his mind. Simo. Yet, in my eyes, he seem'd a little sad. Davus. Not upon that account. He has, he thinks Another reason to complain of you. Simo. For what? Davus. A trifle. Simo. Well, what is't? Davus. Nay, nothing. Simo. Tell me, what is't? Davus. You are then he complains, Somewhat too sparing of expence. Simo. I? Davus. You. The Attick Drachma was equal to seven-pence, three farthings, of English money. Cooke. A feast of scarce ten Drachms! Does this, says he, Look like a wedding-supper for his son? What friends can I invite? especially, At such a time as this?—and, truly, Sir, You have been very frugal; much too sparing. I can't commend you for it. Simo. Hold your peace. Davus. I've ruffled him. [aside. Simo. I'll look to that. Away! [Exit Davus. What now? What means the varlet? Precious Rogue, For if there's any Knavery on foot, The second Act of the Andrian of Baron is, like the first, very nearly an exact translation of Terence. He, I am sure, is the contriver on't. [Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. SIMO, DAVUS, coming out of Simo's House.—MYSIS, LESBIA, going towards the House of Glycerium. Mysis. Ay, marry, 'tis as you say, Lesbia: Women scarce ever find a constant man. Simo. The Andrian's maid-servant! Is't not? Davus. Ay. Mysis. But Pamphilus— Simo. What says she? [overhearing. Mysis. Has been true. Simo. How's that? [overhearing. Davus. Wou'd he were deaf, or she were dumb! [aside. Mysis. For the child, Boy or Girl, he has resolv'd To educate. Simo. O Jupiter! what's this I hear? If this be true, I'm lost indeed. Lesbia. A good young Gentleman! Mysis. Oh, very good. But in, in, lest you make her wait. Lesbia. I follow. [Exeunt Mysis and Lesbia. SCENE II. Manent SIMO, DAVUS. Davus. Unfortunate! What remedy! [aside. Simo. How's this? [to himself. And can he be so mad? What! educate A Harlot's child!—Ah, now I know their drift: Fool that I was, scarce smelt it out at last. Davus listening.] What's this he says he has smelt out? Simo. Imprimis, [to himself. 'Tis this Rogue's trick upon me. All a sham: A counterfeit deliv'ry, and mock labour, Devis'd to frighten Chremes from the match. Glycerium within.] Juno Lucina was the Goddess supposed to preside over child-birth. “In their Comedies, the Romans generally borrowed their plots from the Greek Poets; and theirs was commonly a little Girl stolen or wandered from her Parents, brought back unknown to the city, there got with child by some lewd young fellow; who, by the help of his servant, cheats his father: and when her time comes, to cry Juno Lucina, fer opem! one or other sees a little Box or Cabinet, which was carried away with her, and so discovers her to her friends; if some God do not prevent it, by coming down in a Machine, and taking the thanks of it to himself. “By the Plot you may guess much of the characters of the Persons. An old father, who would willingly, before he dies, see his Son well married; a debauched Son, kind in his nature to his mistress, but miserably in want of money; a servant or slave, who has so much wit as to strike in with him, and help to dupe his father; a Braggadochio Captain; a Parasite; and a Lady of Pleasure. “As for the poor honest maid, on whom the Story is built, and who ought to be one the principal Actors in the Play, she is commonly a Mute in it: She has the breeding of the old Elizabeth way, which was for maids to be seen, and not to be heard; and it is enough you know she is willing to be married when the fifth Act requires it.” Dryden's Essay of Dramatick Poesie. It must be remembered that Dryden's Essay is written in the form of a Dialogue, and therefore the above Extract is not to be supposed to be absolutely the very opinion of the writer, but receives a good deal of its high colouring from the character of the Speaker. It is true, indeed, that this crying out of a woman in labour behind the Scenes, which Donatus gravely remarks is the only way in which the Severity of the Comœdiæ Palliata would allow a young gentlewoman to be introduced, is perhaps the most exceptionable circumstance of all the antient Drama: and if the modern Theatre has any transcendent advantage over the antient, it is in the frequent and successful introduction of female personages. The antients were so little sensible of the impropriety or indecorum of such an incident, that it is (as Dryden has observed) introduced into many of their plays, wherein the Lady cries out in the same, or very similar, words with Glycerium. I do not, however, remember any play where the Lady in the Straw produces so many pleasant circumstances, as in the play before us; nor is there, I think, any one of those circumstances, except the crying out, which might not be represented on our Stage. This act, and the next, which are entirely built on the delivery of Glycerium, are the most humourous of the five; and yet these very acts seem to have been the most obnoxious to the delicacy of the modern imitators of our Author. Sir Richard Steele, indeed, departed in many other circumstances from the Fable of Terence, so that it is no wonder he took the advantage of bringing our Glycerium on the Stage in the person of Indiana: but Baron, who has wrought his whole piece on the Ground of Terence, thought it necessary to new-mould these two Acts, and has introduced Glycerium merely to fill up the chasm created by the omission of the other incidents. Baron, I doubt not, judged right in thinking it unsafe to hazard them on the French Stage: but it must be obvious to every reader that the deadest and most insipid parts of Baron's play are those scenes in which he deviates from Terence. Juno Lucina, save me! help, I pray thee. Simo. Hey day! Already? Oh ridiculous! Soon as she heard that I was at the Door She hastens to cry out: Your incidents Non sat commode divisa sunt temporibus tibi, Dave, hæc. A metaphor taken from the Theatre. Dacier. Are ill-tim'd, Davus. Davus. Mine, Sir? Simo. Are your players Unmindful of their Cues, and want a Prompter? Davus. I do not comprehend you. Simo apart.] If this Knave Had, in the real Nuptial of my Son, Come thus upon me unprepar'd, what sport, What scorn he'd have expos'd me to? But now At his own peril be it. I'm secure. SCENE III. Re-enter LESBIA.—ARCHYLLIS appears at the door. Lesbia to Arch. within.] As yet, Archyllis, all the symptoms seem As good as might be wish'd in her condition: First, let her make ablution: after that, Drink what I've order'd her, and just so much: And presently I will be here again. [coming forward. Now, by this good day, Master Pamphilus Has got a chopping Boy: Heav'n grant it live! For he's a worthy Gentleman, and scorn'd To do a wrong to this young innocent. [Exit. SCENE IV. Simo. This too, where's he that knows you wou'd not swear Was your contrivance? Davus. My Contrivance! what, Sir? Simo. While in the House, forsooth, the midwife gave No orders for the Lady in the Straw: But having issued forth into the Street, Bawls out most lustily to those within. —Oh Davus, am I then so much your Scorn? Seem I so proper to be play'd upon, With such a shallow, barefac'd, imposition? You might at least, in reverence, have us'd Some Spice of Art, wer't only to pretend You fear'd my anger, shou'd I find you out. Davus. I'faith now he deceives himself, not I. [aside. Simo. Did not I give you warning? threaten too, In case you play'd me false? But all in vain: For what car'd you?—What! think you I believe This story of a child by Pamphilus? Davus. I see his error: Now I know my game. [aside. Simo. Why don't you answer? Davus. What! you don't believe it? As if you had not been inform'd of this? [archly. Simo. I been inform'd? Davus. What then you found it out? [archly. Simo. D'ye laugh at me? Davus. You must have been inform'd: Or whence this shrewd suspicion? Simo. Whence! from you: Because I know you. Davus. Meaning, this was done By my Advice. Simo. Beyond all doubt: I know it: Davus. You do not know me, Simo.— Simo. I not know you? Davus. For if I do but speak, immediately You think yourself impos'd on.— Simo. Falsely, hey? Davus. So that I dare not ope my lips before you. Simo. All that I know is this; that nobody Has been deliver'd here. Davus. You've found it out? Yet by and bye they'll bring the bantling here, And lay it at our door. Remember, Sir, I give you warning that will be the case; That you may stand prepar'd, nor after say, 'Twas done by Davus's advice, his tricks! I wou'd fain cure your ill opinion of me. Simo. But how d'ye know? Davus. I've heard so, and believe so. Besides a thousand things concur to lead To this conjecture. In the first place, she Profess'd herself with child by Pamphilus: That proves a falsehood. Now that she perceives A nuptial preparation at our house, A maid's dispatch'd immediately to bring A midwife to her, and withal a child This was a piece of roguery very common in Greece, where they often deceived the old men by suppositious children. Dacier.: You too they will contrive shall see the child, Or else the Wedding must proceed. Simo. How's this? Having discover'd such a plot on foot, Why did you not directly tell my Son? Davus. Who then has drawn him from her but myself? For we all know how much he doated on her: But now he wishes for a Wife. In fine, Leave that affair to me; and you mean while Persue, as you've begun, the Nuptials; which The Gods, I hope, will prosper! Simo. Get you in. Wait for me there, and see that you prepare What's requisite. [Exit Davus. He has not wrought upon me To yield implicit credit to his tale, Nor do I know if all he said be true. But, true or false, it matters not: to me My Son's own promise is the main concern. Now to meet Chremes, and to beg his daughter In marriage with my Son: If I succeed, What can I rather wish, than to behold Their marriage-rites to-day? For since my Son Has given me his word, I've not a doubt, Should he refuse, but I may force him to it: And to my wishes see where Chremes comes. SCENE V. Enter CHREMES Chremes is a humane, natural, unaffected old gentleman. Sealand in the Conscious Lovers, the English Chremes, is a sensible respectable merchant. Both the characters are properly sustained: but Chremes being induced first to renew his consent match, and afterwards wrought upon by currences arising in the fable to withdraw again, renders his character more essential to the Drama, than Sealand's.. Simo. Chreme's, Good day! Chremes. The very man I look'd for. Simo. And I for you. Chremes. Well met.—Some persons came To tell me you inform'd them, that my daughter Was to be married to your son to-day: And therefore came I here, and fain wou'd know Whether 'tis you or they have lost their wits. Simo. A moment's hearing; you shall be inform'd, What I request, and what you wish to know. Chremes. I hear: what would you? speak. Simo. Now by the Gods; Now by our friendship, Chremes, which, begun In infancy, has still encreas'd with age; Now by your only daughter, and my son, Whose preservation wholly rests on you; Let me intreat this boon: and let the match Which should have been, still be. Chremes. Why, why intreat? Knowing you ought not to beseech this of me. Think you, that I am other than I was, When first I gave my promise? If the match Be good for both, e'en call them forth to wed. But if their union promises more harm Than good to both, You also, I beseech you, Consult our common interest, as if You were her father, Pamphilus my son. Simo. E'en in that spirit, I desire it, Chremes, Intreat it may be done; nor would intreat, But that occasion urges. Chremes. What occasion? Simo. A difference 'twixt Glycerium and my son. Chremes. I hear. [ironically. Simo. A breach so wide as gives me hopes To sep'rate them for ever. Chremes. Idle tales! Simo. Indeed 'tis thus. Chremes. Ay marry, thus it is. Quarrels of lovers but renew their love. Simo. Prevent we then, I pray, this mischief now; While time permits, while yet his passion's sore From contumelies; e'er these womens' wiles, Their wicked arts, and tears made up of fraud Shake his weak mind, and melt it to compassion. Give him a wife: By intercourse with her, Knit by the bonds of wedlock, soon, I hope, He'll rise above the guilt that sinks him now. Chremes. So you believe: for me, I cannot think That he'll be constant, or that I can bear it. Simo. How can you know, unless you make the trial? Chremes. Ay, but to make that trial on a daughter Is hard indeed. Simo. The mischief, should he fail, Is only this: divorce, which heav'n forbid! But mark what benefits if he amend! First, to your friend you will restore a son; Gain to yourself a son-in-law, and match Your daughter to an honest husband. Chremes. Well! Since you're so thoroughly convinc'd 'tis right, I can deny you naught that lies in me. Simo. I see I ever lov'd you justly, Chremes. Chremes. But then— Simo. But what? Chremes. Whence is't you know That there's a difference between them? Simo. Davus, Davus, in all their secrets, told me so; Advis'd me too, to hasten on the match As fast as possible. Wou'd he, d'ye think, Do that, unless he were full well assur'd My son desir'd it too?—Hear, what he says. Ho there! call Davus forth.—But here he comes. SCENE VI. Enter DAVUS. Davus. I was about to seek you. Simo. What's the matter? Davus. Why is not the bride sent for? it grows late. Simo. D'ye hear him?—Davus, I for some time past Was fearful of you; lest, like other slaves, As slaves go now, you should put tricks upon me, And baffle me, to favour my son's love. Davus. I, Sir? Simo. I thought so: and in fear of that Conceal'd a secret which I'll now disclose. Davus. What secret, Sir? Simo. I'll tell you: for I now Almost begin to think you may be trusted. Davus. You've found what sort of man I am at last. Simo. No marriage was intended. Davus. How! none! Simo. None. All counterfeit, to sound my son and you. Davus. How say you? Simo. Even so. Davus. Alack, alack! I never could have thought it. Ah, what art! [archly. Simo. Hear me. No sooner had I sent you in, But opportunely I encounter'd Chremes. Davus. How! are we ruin'd then? [aside. Simo. I told him all, That you had just told me,— Davus. Confusion! how? [aside. Simo. Begg'd him to grant his daughter, and at length With much ado prevail'd. Davus. Undone! [aside. Simo. How's that? [overhearing. Davus. Well done! I said. Simo. My good friend Chremes then Is now no obstacle. Chremes. I'll home awhile, Order due preparations, and return. [Exit. Simo. Prithee, now, Davus, seeing you alone Have brought about this match— Davus. Yes, I alone. Simo. Endeavour farther to amend my son. Davus. Most diligently. Simo. It were easy now, While his mind's irritated. Davus. Be at peace. Simo. Do then: where is he? Davus. Probably, at home. Simo. I'll in, and tell him, what I've now told you. [Exit. SCENE VII. DAVUS alone. Lost and undone! To prison with me strait! No prayer, no plea: for I have ruin'd all: Deceiv'd the old man, hamper'd Pamphilus With marriage; marriage, brought about to-day By my sole means; beyond the hopes of one; Against the other's will.—Oh cunning fool! Had I been quiet, all had yet been well. But see, he's coming. Would my neck were broken! [retires. SCENE VIII. Enter PAMPHILUS; DAVUS behind. Pam. Where is this villain that has ruin'd me? Davus. I'm a lost man. Pam. And yet I must confess, That I deserv'd this, being such a dolt, A very ideot, to commit my fortunes To a vile slave. I suffer for my folly, But will at least take vengeance upon him. Davus. If I can but escape this mischief now, I'll answer for hereafter. Pam. To my father What shall I say?—And can I then refuse, Who have but now consented? with what face? I know not what to do. Davus. I'faith, nor I; And yet it takes up all my thoughts. I'll tell him I've hit on something to delay the match. Pam. Oh! [seeing Davus. Davus. I am seen. Pam. So, Good Sir! What say you? See, how I'm hamper'd with your fine advice. Davus coming forward.] But I'll deliver you. Pam. Deliver me? Davus. Certainly, Sir. Pam. What, as you did just now? Davus. Better, I hope. Pam. And can you then believe That I would trust you, Rascal? You amend My broken fortunes, or redeem them lost? You, who to-day, from the most happy state, Have thrown me upon marriage.—Did not I Foretell it would be thus? Davus. You did indeed. Pam. And what do you deserve for this? Quid meritus? This question is taken from the custom of the Athenians, who never condemned a criminal without first asking what punishment he thought he deserved; and according to the nature of the culprit's answer, they mitigated or aggravated his punishment. Dacier. The Commentators cite a passage exactly parallel from the Frogs of Aristophanes. Davus. The gallows. —Yet suffer me to take a little breath, I'll devise something presently. Pam. Alas, Characters too faintly drawn are the opposite of Caricature. Pamphilus in the Andrian is, in my mind a faint character. Davus has precipitated him into a marriage that he abhors. His mistress has but just been brought to-bed. He has a hundred reasons to be out of humour. Yet he takes all in good part. Diderot. I cannot think there is much justice in the above observation. Pamphilus appears to me to have all the feelings of an amiable and ingenuous mind. There is an observation of Donatus on Simo's observing to Davus, at the end of the second Act, that his son appeared to him to be rather melancholy, which is in my opinion infinitely more just, and applicable to the character of Pamphilus than the remark of our ingenious French Critick. It has been reserved for this place on purpose to oppose them to each other. The passage and note on it are as follow. I have not leisure for your punishment. The time demands attention to myself, Nor will be wasted in revenge on you. Yet in my mind he seem'd a little sad.] The propriety of behaviour necessary to the different characters of the Son and the Lover, is wonderfully preserved in this instance. A deceit, sustained with great assurance, would not have been agreeable to the character of an ingenuous youth: and it would have been improbable in the character of the Lover to have entirely smothered his concern. He suppresses it therefore in some measure, because the thing was to be concealed; but could not assume a thorough joyfulness, because his disposition and his passion inspired him with melancholy. Donatus. It may be added also, as a further answer to Diderot, that the words with which Pamphilus concludes this act, alluding to his present situation, assign a very natural reason for his subduing the transports of his anger towards Davus.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. CHARINUS alone. Is this to be believ'd, or to be told? Can then such inbred malice live in man, To joy in ill, and from another's woes To draw his own delight?—Ah, is't then so? —Yes, such there are, the meanest of mankind, Who, from a sneaking bashfulness, at first Dare not refuse; but when the time comes on To make their promise good, then force perforce Open themselves and fear: yet must deny. Then too, oh shameless impudence, they cry, “Who then are you? and what are you to me? “Why should I render up my love to you? “Faith, neighbour, charity begins at home.” —Speak of their broken faith, they blush not, they, Now throwing off that shame they ought to wear, Which they before assum'd without a cause. —What shall I do? go to him? on my wrongs Expostulate, and throw reproaches on him? What will that profit, say you?—very much. I shall at least embitter his delight, And gratify my anger. SCENE II. To him PAMPHILUS and DAVUS. Pam. Oh, Charinus, By my Imprudence, unless Heav'n forefend, I've ruin'd both myself and you. Char. Imprudence! Paltry evasion! You have broke your faith. Pam. What now? Char. And do you think that words like these Can baffle me again? Pam. What means all this? Char. Soon as I told you of my passion for her, Then she had charms for you.—Ah, senseless fool, To judge your disposition by my own! Pam. You are mistaken. Char. Was your joy no joy, Without abusing a fond Lover's mind, Fool'd on with idle hopes?—Well, take her. Pam. Take her? Alas, you know not what a wretch I am: How many cares this slave has brought upon me, My rascal here. Char. No wonder, if he takes Example from his master. Pam. Ah, you know not Me, or my love, or else you would not talk thus. Char. Oh yes, I know it all. You had but now A dreadful altercation with your father: And therefore he's enrag'd, nor could prevail On you, forsooth, to wed. [ironically. Pam. To shew you then, How little you conceive of my distress, These nuptials were mere semblance, mock'ry all, Nor was a wife intended me. Char. I know it: You are constrained, poor man, by inclination. Pam. Nay, but have patience! you don't know— Char. I know That you're to marry her. Pam. Why rack me thus? Nay hear! He never ceas'd to importune That I wou'd tell my father, I would wed; So prest, and urg'd, that he at length prevail'd. Char. Who did this? Pam. Davus. Char. Davus! Pam. Davus all. Char. Wherefore? Pam. I know not: but I know the Gods Meant in their anger I should listen to him. Char. Is it so, Davus? Davus. Even so. Char. How, villain? The Gods confound you for it!—Tell me, wretch, Had all his most inveterate foes desir'd To throw him on this marriage, what advice Could they have given else? Davus. I am deceiv'd, But not dishearten'd. Char. True. [ironically. Davus. This way has fail'd; We'll try another way: unless you think Because the business has gone ill at first, We cannot graft advantage on misfortune. Pam. Oh ay, I warrant you, if you look to't, Out of one wedding you can work me two. Davus. Pamphilus, 'tis my duty, as your slave, To strive with might and main, by day and night, With hazard of my life, to do you service: 'Tis your's, if I am crost, to pardon me. My undertakings fail indeed, but then I spare no pains. Do better, if you can, And send me packing. Pam. Ay, with all my heart: Place me but where you found me first. Davus. I will. Pam. But do it instantly. Davus. Hist! hold awhile: I hear the creaking of Glycerium's door. Pam. Nothing to you. Davus. I'm thinking. Pam. What, at last? Davus. Your business shall be done, and presently. SCENE III. Enter MYSIS. Mysis to Glycer. within.] Be where he will, I'll find your Pamphilus, And bring him with me. Meanwhile, you, my soul, Forbear to vex yourself. Pam. Mysis! Mysis. Who's there? Oh Pamphilus, well met, Sir! Pam. What's the matter? Mysis. My Mistress, by the love you bear her, begs Your presence instantly. She longs to see you. Pam. Ah, I'm undone: This sore breaks out afresh. Unhappy that we are, thro' your curst means, To be tormented thus! [to Davus.]—She has been told A nuptial is prepar'd, and therefore sends. Char. From which how safe you were, had he been quiet! [pointing to Davus. Davus. Ay, if he raves not of himself enough, Do, irritate him. [to Charinus. Mysis. Truly that's the cause; And therefore 'tis, poor soul, she sorrows thus. Pam. Mysis, I swear to thee by all the Gods, I never will desert her: tho' assur'd That I for her make all mankind my foes. I sought her, carried her: our hearts are one, And farewell they that wish us put asunder! Death, nought but death shall part us. Mysis. I revive. Pam. Apollo's oracles are not more true. If that my father may be wrought upon, To think I hinder'd not the match, 'tis well: But if that cannot be, come what come may, Why let him know, 'twas I.—What think you now? [to Char. Char. That we are wretches both. Davus. My brain's at work. Char. Oh brave! Pam. I know what you'd attempt. Davus. Well, well! I will effect it for you. Pam. Ay, but now. Davus. E'en now. Char. What is't? Davus. For him, Sir, not for you. Be not mistaken. Char. I am satisfied. Pam. Say, what do you propose? Davus. This day, I fear, Is scarce sufficient for the execution, So think not I have leisure to relate. Hence then! You hinder me: hence, hence I say! Pam. I'll to Glycerium. [Exit. Davus. Well, and what mean you? Whither will you, Sir? Char. Shall I speak the truth? Davus. Oh to be sure: now for a tedious tale! Char. What will become of me? Davus. How! not content! Is it not then sufficient, if I give you The respite of a day, a little day, By putting off his wedding? Char. Ay, but Davus,— Davus. But what? Char. That I may wed— Davus. Ridiculous! Char. If you succeed, come to me. Davus. Wherefore come? I can't assist you. Char. Should it so fall out— Davus. Well, well, I'll come. Char. If ought, I am at home. [Exit. SCENE V. Manent DAVUS, MYSIS. Davus. Mysis, wait here till I come forth. Mysis. For what? Davus. It must be so. Mysis. Make haste then. Davus. In a Moment. [Exit to Glycerium's. SCENE VI. MYSIS alone. Can we securely then count nothing our's? Oh all ye Gods! I thought this Pamphilus The greatest good my mistress could obtain, Friend, lover, husband, ev'ry way a blessing: And yet what woe, poor wretch, endures she not On his account? Alas, more ill than good. But here comes Davus. SCENE VII. Re-enter DAVUS with the child. Mysis. Prithee, man, what now? Where are you carrying the child? Davus. Oh, Mysis, Now have I need of all your ready wit, And all your cunning. Mysis. What are you about? Davus. Quick, take the boy, and lay him at our door. Mysis. What on the bare ground? Davus. From the altar then Donatus and Scaliger the father have written that the Altar mentioned here, was the altar usually placed on the stage. When a Tragedy was acted, the altar was dedicated to Bacchus; when a Comedy, to Apollo. But in my opinion the Stage-Altar has no connection with this passage: This adventure is not to be considered as an incident in a Comedy, but as a thing which passes in the street. Probability therefore must be preserved; which it cannot be, if one of the Stage-Altars is employed in this place. At Athens every house had an altar at the street door: [which street-altars are also often mentioned in Plautus.] These altars were covered with fresh herbs every day, and it is one of these altars, to which Terence here alludes. Dacier. It was a custom among the Romans to have an altar sacred to Vesta in the entrance of their houses, whence it was called The Vestibule. Eugraphius. Take herbs and strew them underneath. Mysis. And why Can't you do that yourself? Davus. Because, that if My master chance to put me to my oath That 'twas not I who laid it there, I may With a safe conscience swear. [gives her the child. Mysis. I understand. But pray how came this sudden qualm upon you? Davus. Nay, but be quick, that you may comprehend What I propose.—[Mysis lays the child at Simo's door.] Oh Jupiter! [looking out. Mysis. What now? Davus. Here comes the father of the bride!—I change My first-intended purpose. His first intention doubtless was to go and inform Simo of the child being laid at the door. Dacier. Mysis. What you mean I can't imagine. Davus. This way from the right, I'll counterfeit to come:—And be't your care To throw in aptly now and then a word, To help out the discourse as need requires. Mysis. Still what you're at, I cannot comprehend. But if I can assist, as you know best, Not to obstruct your purposes, I'll stay. [Davus retires. SCENE VIII. Enter CHREMES going towards Simo's. Chremes. Having provided all things necessary, I now return to bid them call the bride. What's here? [seeing the child.] by Hercules, a child! Ha, woman, Was't you that laid it here? Mysis. Where is he gone? [looking after Davus. Chremes. What, won't you answer me? Mysis. looking about.] Not here: Ah me! The fellow's gone, and left me in the lurch. [Davus coming forward and pretending not to see them. Davus. Good heavens, what confusion at the Forum! The people all disputing with each other! The market-price is so confounded high. [loud. What to say else I know not. [aside. Mysis. to Davus.] What d'ye mean [Chremes retires, and listens to their conversation. By leaving me alone? Davus. What farce is this? Ha, Mysis, whence this Child? Who brought it here? Mysis. Have you your wits, to ask me such a question? Davus. Whom should I ask, when no one else is here? Chremes behind.] I wonder whence it comes. [to himself. Davus. Wilt answer me? [loud. Mysis. Ah! [confused. Davus. This way to the right! [apart to Mysis. Mysis. You're raving mad. Was't not yourself? Davus. I charge you not a word, But what I ask you. [apart to Mysis. Mysis. Do you threaten me? Davus. Whence comes this child? [loud. Mysis. From our house. A nobis. Most of the Books read a VOBIS, but I am persuaded the other is the right reading. The fact is, the child really came from Glycerium's, and Davus's laughing at the impudence of Mysis in owning it, and the immediate observation of Chremes, that she was the Andrian's maid, is more agreeable to this sense. Besides the mention of the other family is reserved for the answers drawn from Mysis by Davus's asking her whose child it was. Davus. Ha! ha! ha! No wonder that a harlot has assurance. Chremes. This is the Andrian's servant-maid, I take it. Davus. Do we then seem to you such proper folks To play these tricks upon? [loud to Mys. Chremes. I came in time. [to himself. Dav. Make haste, and take your bantling from our door. [loud. Hold! do not stir from where you are, besure. [softly. Mysis. A plague upon you: you so terrify me! Davus. Wench, did I speak to you or no? [loud. Mysis. What would you? Davus. What would I? Say, whose child have you laid here? Tell me. [loud. Mysis. You don't know? Davus. Plague of what I know: Tell what I ask. [softly. Mysis. Your's. Davus. Ours? Whose? [loud. Mysis. Pamphilus's. Davus. How say you? Pamphilus's? [loud. Mysis. Why is't not? Chremes. I had good cause to be against this match. [to himself. Davus. O monstrous impudence! [bawling. Mysis. Why all this noise? Davus. Did not I see this child convey'd by stealth Into your house last night? Mysis. Oh rogue! Davus. 'Tis true. I saw old Canthara stuff'd out? Mysis. Thank heav'n, Free-women: For in Greece as well as in Italy, slaves were not admitted to give evidence. Dacier. Some free-women were present at her labour? Davus. Troth, she don't know the gentleman, for whom She plays this game. She thinks, should Chremes see The Child laid here, he would not grant his daughter. Faith, he would grant her the more willingly. Chremes. Not he indeed. [to himself. Davus. But now, one word for all, Take up the child; or I shall trundle him Into the middle of the street, and roll You, madam, in the mire. Mysis. The fellow's drunk. Davus. One piece of knavery begets another: Now, I am told, 'tis whisper'd all about, That she's a citizen of Athens— [loud. Chremes. How! Davus. Among the laws of Athens was that equitable one, which compelled the man to marry her whom he had debauched, if she was a free Woman. Cooke. And that by law he will be forc'd to wed her. Mysis. Why prithee is she not a citizen? Chremes. What a fine scrape was I within a hair Of being drawn into! [to himself. Davus. What voice is that? [turning about. Oh Chremes! you are come in time. Attend! Chremes. I have heard all already. Davus. You've heard all? Chremes. Yes, all, I say, from first to last. Davus. Indeed? Good lack, what knaveries! This lying jade Should be dragg'd hence to torture.—This is he! [to Mys. Think not 'twas Davus you imposed upon. Mysis. Ah me!—Good Sir, I spoke the truth indeed. Chremes. I know the whole.—Is Simo in the house? Davus. Yes Sir. [Exit Chrem. SCENE IX. Manent DAVUS, MYSIS. Davus runs up to her. Mysis. Don't offer to touch me, you villain! If I don't tell my mistress every word— Davus. Why you don't know, you fool, what good we've done. Mysis. How should I? Davus. This is father to the bride: Nor could it otherwise have been contrived That he should know what we would have him. Mysis. Well, You should have giv'n me notice. Davus. Is there then It is an observation of Volraire's in the preface to his Comedy of L' Enfant Prodigue, that although there are various kinds of pleasantry that excite mirth, yet universal bursts of laughter are seldom produced, unless by a scene of mistake or æquivoque. A thousand instances might be given to prove the truth of this judicious observation. There is scarce any writer of Comedy, who has not drawn from this source of humour. A scene founded on a misunderstanding between the parties, where the characters are all at cross purposes with each other, never fails to set the audience in a roar: nor indeed can there be a happier incident in a Comedy, if produced naturally, and managed judiciously. The scenes in this act, occasioned by the artifice of Davus concerning the child, do not fall directly under the observation of Voltaire, but are however, so much of the same colour, that if represented on the stage, they would, I doubt not, have the like effect, and be the best means of confuting those infidel Critics, who maintain that Terence has no humour. I do not remember a scene in any Comedy, where there is such a natural complication of pleasant circumstances. Davus's sudden change of his intentions on seeing Chremes, without having time to explain himself to Mysis; her confusion and comical distress, together with the genuine simplicity of her answers; and the conclusion drawn by Chremes from their supposed quarrel; are all finely imagined, and directly calculated for the purposes of exciting the highest mirth in the spectators. The words of Davus to Mysis in this speech “Is there then, &amp;c. have the air of an oblique praise of scene from the Poet himself, shewing with what art it is introduced, and how naturally it is sustained. Sir Richard Steele had deviated so much from Terence in the original construction of his fable, that he had no opportunity of working this scene into it. Baron, who, I suppose, was afraid to hazard it on the French Theatre, fills up the chasm by bringing Glycerium on the stage. She, amused by Davus with a forged tale of the falsehood of Pamphilus, throws herself at the feet of Chremes, and prevails on him once more to break off the intended match with Philumena. In consequence of this alteration, the most lively part of the comedy in Terence, becomes the gravest in Baron; the artifice of Davus is carried on with the most starch formality; and the whole incident, as conducted in the French imitation, loses all that air of ease and pleasantry, which it wears in the orginal. No diff'rence, think you, whether all you say Falls naturally from the heart, or comes From dull premeditation? SCENE X. Enter CRITO. Crito. In this street They say that Chrysis liv'd: who rather chose To heap up riches here by wanton ways, Than to live poor and honestly at home: She dead, her fortune comes by law to me. But I see persons to enquire of. [goes up.] Save you! Mysis. Good now, who's that I see? is it not Crito, Chrysis's Kinsman? Ay, the very same. Crito. O Mysis, save you! Mysis. Save you, Crito! Crito. Chrysis Is then—ha? Mysis. Ay, she has left us, poor souls! Crito. And ye; how go ye on here?—pretty well? Mysis. We?—as we can, as the old saying goes, When as we would we cannot. Crito. And Glycerium, Has she found out her parents? Mysis. Wou'd she had! Crito. Not yet! an ill wind blew me hither then. For truly, had I been appriz'd of that, I'd ne'er have set foot here: For this Glycerium Was always call'd and thought to be her sister. What Chrysis left, She takes possession of: And now for me, a stranger, to commence A law-suit here, how good and wise it were, Other examples teach me. She, I warrant, Has got her some gallant too, some defender: For she was growing up a jolly girl When first she journied hither. They will cry That I'm a petty-fogger, fortune-hunter, A beggar.—And besides it were not well To leave her in distress. Mysis. Good soul! Troth, Crito, You have the good old-fashion'd honesty. Crito. Well, since I am arriv'd here, bring me to her, That I may see her. Mysis. Ay, with all my heart. Davus. I will in with them: for I wou'd not chuse That our old gentleman should see me now. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. CHREMES, SIMO. Chremes. Enough already, Simo, and enough I've shewn my friendship for you; hazarded Enough of peril: urge me then no more! Wishing to please you, I had near destroy'd My daughter's peace and happiness for ever. Simo. Ah, Chremes, I must now intreat the more, More urge you to confirm the promis'd boon. Chremes. Mark, how unjust you are thro' wilfulness! So you obtain what you demand, you set No bounds to my compliance, nor consider What you request; for if you did consider, You'd cease to load me with these injuries. Simo. What injuries? Chremes. Is that a question now? Have you not driven me to plight my child To one possest with other love, averse To marriage; to expose her to divorce, And crazy nuptials; by her woe and bane To work a cure for your distemper'd son? You had prevail'd; I travell'd in the match, While circumstances would admit; but now The case is chang'd, content you:—It is said, That she's a citizen; a child is born: Prithee excuse us! Simo. Now, for heaven's sake, Believe not Them, whose interest it is To make him vile and abject as themselves. These stories are all feign'd, concerted all, To break the match: when the occasion's past, That urges them to this, they will desist. Chremes. Oh, you mistake: E'en now I saw the maid Wrangling with Davus. Simo. Artifice! mere trick. Chremes. Ay, but in earnest; and when neither knew That I was there. Simo. It may be so: and Davus Told me before-hand they'd attempt all this; Though I, I know not how, forgot to tell you. SCENE II. Enter DAVUS from Glycerium's. Davus to himself.] He may be easy now, I warrant him— Chremes. See yonder's Davus. Simo. Ha! whence comes the rogue? Davus. By my assistance, and this stranger's safe. [to himself.] Simo. What mischief's this? [listening. Davus. A more commodious man, Arriving just in season, at a time So critical, I never knew. [to himself. Simo. A knave! Who's that he praises? [listening. Davus. All is now secure. [to himself. Simo. Why don't I speak to him? Davus. My master here! [turning about. What shall I do? [to himself. Simo. Good Sir, your humble servant! [sneering. Davus. Oh, Simo! and our Chremes!—All is now Prepar'd within. Simo. You've taken special care. [ironically. Davus. E'en call them when you please. Simo. Oh, mighty fine! That to be sure is all that's wanting now. —But tell me, Sir! what business had you there? [pointing to Glycerium's. Davus. I? [confused. Simo. You. Davus. I—? [stammering. Simo. You, Sir. Davus. I went in but now. [disordered. Simo. As if I ask'd, how long it was ago. Davus. With Pamphilus. Simo. Is Pamphilus within? —Oh torture!—Did not you assure me, sirrah, They were at variance? Davus. So they are. Simo. Why then Is Pamphilus within? Chremes. Oh, why d'ye think? He's gone to quarrel with her. [sneering. Davus. Nay but, Chremes, There's more in this, and you shall hear strange news. There's an old contryman, I know not who, Is just arriv'd here; confident and shrewd; His look bespeaks him of some consequence. A grave severity is in his face, And credit in his words. Simo. What story now? Davus. Nay, nothing, sir, but what I heard him say. Simo. And what says he, then? Davus. That he's well assur'd Glycerium's an Athenian citizen. Simo. Ho, Dromo! Dromo! [calling. Davus. What now? Simo. Dromo! Davus. Hear me. Simo. Speak but a word more—Dromo! Davus. Pray, Sir, hear! SCENE III. Enter DROMO. Dromo. Your pleasure, Sir? Simo. Here drag him headlong in, And truss the rascal up immediately. Dromo. Whom? Simo. Davus. Davus. Why? Simo. Because I'll have it so. Take him, I say. Davus. For what offence? Simo. Off with him! Davus. If it appear that I've said ought but truth, Put me to death. Simo. I will not hear. I'll trounce you. Davus. But tho' it should prove true, Sir! Simo. True or false. See that you keep him bound: and do you hear? Quadrupedem constringito. It was usual among the Athenians to tie criminals, hands and feet together, like a calf, Echard. Bind the slave hand and foot. Away! [Exeunt Dromo and Davus. SCENE IV. Manent SIMO, CHREMES. By heav'n, As I do live, I'll make you know this day What peril lies in trifling with a master, And make Him know what 'tis to plague a father. Chremes. Ah, be not in such rage. Simo. Oh Chremes, Chremes, Filial unkindness!—Don't you pity me? To feel all this for such a thankless son!— Here, Pamphilus, come forth! ho, Pamphilus! Have you no shame? [calling at Glycerium's door. SCENE V. Enter PAMPHILUS. Pam. Who calls?—Undone! my father! Simo. What say you? Most— Chremes. Ah, rather speak at once Your purpose, Simo, and forbear reproach. Simo. As if 'twere possible to utter aught Severer than he merits!—Tell me then; [to Pam. Glycerium is a citizen? Pam. They say so. Simo. They say so!—Oh amazing impudence!— Does he consider what he says? does he Repent the deed? or does his colour take The hue of shame?—To be so weak of soul, Against the custom of our citizens, There was a law among the Athenians, that no citizen should marry a stranger; which law also excluded such as were not born of two citizens, from all offices of trust and honour. See Plutarch's Life of Pericles. Cooke. Against the law, against his father's will, To wed himself to shame and this vile woman. Pam. Wretch that I am! Simo. Ah, Pamphilus! d'ye feel Your wretchedness at last? Then, then, when first You wrought upon your mind at any rate To gratify your passion; from that hour Well might you feel your state of wretchedness. —But why give in to this? Why torture thus, Why vex my spirit? Why afflict my age For his distemp'rature? Why rue his sins? —No; let him have her, joy in her, live with her. Pam. My father!— Simo. How, my father!—can I think Donatus is full of admiration of this speech, and tells us that it was not taken from Menander, but original in Terence. You want this father? You that for yourself A home, a wife, and children have acquir'd Against your father's will? And witnesses Suborn'd, to prove that she's a citizen? —You've gain'd your point. Pam. My father, but one word! Simo. What would you say? Chremes. Nay, hear him, Simo. Simo. Hear him? What must I hear then, Chremes? Chremes. Let him speak. Simo. Well, let him speak: I hear him. Pam. I confess, I love Glycerium: if it be a fault, That too I do confess. To you, my father, I yield myself: dispose me as you please! Command me! Say, that I shall take a wife; Leave Her;—I will endure it, as I may.— This only I beseech you, think not I Suborn'd this old man hither.—Suffer me To clear myself, and bring him here before you. Simo. Bring him here! Pam. Let me, father! Chremes. 'Tis but just: Permit him! Pam. Grant me this! Simo. Well, be it so. The above scene, admirable as it is, had not, it seems, sufficient temptations for Sir Richard Steele to induce him to include it in his plan of the Conscious Lovers. Bevil and his Father are never brought to an open rupture, like Simo and Pamphilus, but rather industriously kept from coming to any explanation, which is one reason of the insipidity and want of spirit in their characters. It must be obvious to every reader, how naturally this scene brings on the catastrophe: how injudiciously then has the English Poet deprived his audience of the pleasure that must have arisen from it in the representation, and contented himself with making Sir J. Bevil declare, at entering with his son, after the discovery is “over, Your good sister, Sir, has with the story of your daughter's fortune, filled us with surprize and joy! Now all exceptions are removed; my Son has now avowed his love, and turned all former jealousies and doubts to approbation, and, I am told; your goodness has consented to reward him.” How many dramatick incidents, what fine pictures of the manners, has Terence drawn from the circumstances huddled together in these few lines of Sir Richard Steele! Exit Pamphilus. I could bear all this bravely, Chremes; more, Much more, to know that he deceiv'd me not. Chremes. For a great fault a little punishment Suffices to a father. SCENE V. Re-enter PAMPHILUS with CRITO. Crito. Say no more! Any of these inducements would prevail: Or your intreaty, or that it is truth, Or that I wish it for Glycerium's sake. Chremes. Whom do I see? Crito, the Andrian? Nay certainly 'tis Crito. Crito. Save you, Chremes! Chremes. What has brought you to Athens? Crito. Accident. But is this Simo? Chremes. Ay. Simo. Asks he for me? So Sir, you say that this Glycerium Is an Athenian citizen? Crito. Do you Deny it? Simo. What then are you come prepar'd? Crito. Prepar'd! for what? Simo. And dare you ask for what? Shall you go on thus with impunity? Lay snares for inexperienc'd, lib'ral, youth, With fraud, temptation, and fair promises Soothing their minds?— Crito. Have you your wits? Simo. —And then With marriage solder up their harlot loves? Pam. Alas, I fear the stranger will not bear this. [aside. Chremes. Knew you this person, Simo, you'd not think thus: He's a good man. Simo. A good man he?—To come, Altho' at Athens never seen till now, So opportunely on the wedding-day!— Is such a fellow to be trusted, Chremes? Pam. Ni metuam patrem, habeo pro illa re illum quod moneam probe. Madam Dacier, and several English translations, make Pamphilus say that he could give Crito a hint or two. What hints he could propose to suggest to Crito I cannot conceive. The Italian translation, printed with the Vatican Terence, seems to understand the words in the same manner that I have translated them, in which sense (the pronoun illum referring to Simo instead of Crito) they seem to be the most natural words of Pamphilus on occasion of his father's anger, and the speech immediately preceding. But that I fear my father, I could make That matter clear to him. [aside. Simo. A Sharper! Crito. How? Chremes. It is his humour, Crito: do not heed him. Crito. Let him look to't. If he persists in saying Whate'er he pleases, I shall make him hear Something that may displease him.—Do I stir In these affairs, or make them my concern? Bear your misfortunes patiently! For me, If I speak true or false, shall now be known. —“A man of Athens once upon a time “Was shipwreck'd on the coast of Andros: with him “This very woman, then an infant. He “In this distress applied, it so fell out, “For help to Chrysis' father— Simo. All romance. Chremes. Let him alone. Crito. And will he interrupt me? Chremes. Go on. Crito. “Now Chrysis' father, who receiv'd him, “Was my relation. There I've often heard “The mam himself declare, he was of Athens. “There too he died.” Chremes. His name? Crito. His name, so quickly?—Phania. Chremes. Amazement! Crito. By my troth, I think 'twas Phania; But this I'm sure, he said he was of Rhamnus Rhamnus, Piræus, &amp;c. are to be understood as maritime towns of Attica. Donatus.. Chremes. Oh Jupiter! Crito. These circumstances, Chremes, Were known to many others, then in Andros. Chremes. Heav'n grant it may be as I wish!—Inform me, Whose daughter, said he, was the child? his own? Crito. No, not his own. Chremes. Whose then? Crito. His brother's daughter. Chremes. Mine, mine undoubtedly! Crito. What say you? Simo. How! Pam. Hark, Pamphilus! Simo. But why believe you this? Chremes. That Phania was my brother. Simo. True. I knew him. Chremes. He, to avoid the war, departed hence: And fearing 'twere unsafe to leave the child, Embark'd with her in quest of me for Asia: Since when I've heard no news of him till now. Pam. I'm scarce myself, my mind is so enrapt With fear, hope, joy, and wonder of so great, So sudden happiness. Simo. Indeed, my Chremes, I heartily rejoice she's found your daughter. Pam. I do believe you, father. Chremes. But one doubt There still remains, which gives me pain. Pam. Away With all your doubts! You puzzle a plain cause. [aside. Crito. What is that doubt? Chremes. The name does not agree. Crito. She had another, when a child. Chremes. What, Crito? Can you remember? Crito. I am hunting for it. Pam. Shall then his memory oppose my bliss, When I can minister the cure myself? No, I will not permit it.—Hark you, Chremes, The name is Pasibula. Crito. True. Chremes. The same. Pam. I've heard it from herself a thousand times. Simo. Chremes, I trust you will believe, we all Rejoice at this. Chremes. 'Fore heaven I believe so. Pam. And now, my father— Simo. Peace, son! the event Has reconcil'd me. Pam. O thou best of fathers! Does Chremes too confirm Glycerium mine? Chremes. And with good cause if Simo hinder not. Pam. Sir! [to Simo. P. Nempe. Si. Id scilicet. Donatus, and some others after him, understand these words of Simo and Pamphilus, as requiring a fortune of Chremes with his daughter: and one of them says, that Simo, in order to explain his meaning in the representation, should produce a bag of money. This surely is precious refinement, worthy the genius of a true Commentator. Madam Dacier, who entertains a just veneration for Donatus, doubts the authenticity of the observation ascribed to him. The sense I have followed is, I think, the most obvious and natural interpretation of the words of Pamphilus and Simo, which refer to the preceding, not the subsequent speech, of Chemes. Simo. Be it so. Chremes. My daughter's portion is Ten talents, Pamphilus. All our own translators of this poet have betrayed great ignorance in their estimations of antient sums: and Madam Dacier, and the common Latin Interpreters, seem not to have given themselves much trouble on this head: but this part of antient learning ought not to be past over slightly, since the wealth and plenty of a great and famous state are to be discovered from it. The name of the Talent ought to be preserved in a translation, as should the Mina, Half-Mina, Drachma, and Obolus, for the same reason for which Terence preserved them in his Latin Translations of Greek Plays, viz. because the scene is in Athens, and these are Attick pieces of money. The common Attick Talent, which is Talent mentioned thro' Terence, contained sixty Minæ, as Gronovius, in a note to the Cistellaria of Plautus, and other accurate Enquirers have agreed. Ten Talents therefore were equal to 1937 l. 10 s. of our money, which we may reasonably suppose a tolerable good fortune, considering the price of provisions then in that part of Greece; which we may partly judge of from the passage, where the Obolus is mentioned in the second act of this play. Cooke. Pam. I am content. Chremes. I'll to her instantly: and prithee, Crito, Along with me! for sure she knows me not. [ Crito is, as Donatus calls him, persona in catastrophen machianata, a character formed to bring about the catastrophe. To supply his place in the fable, Sir Richard Steele has converted Phania, the brother of Chremes mentioned in the foregoing scene, into a sister, and substituted Isabella for Crito. But here, I think, and in almost every circumstance of the Discovery, the art of the English Poet is much inferior to that of his Original. Isabella does not maintain her importance in the Drama so well as Crito. Indiana indeed serves to add a degree of Pathos to the scene: but the relation of the incidents of her life, and throwing off her little ornaments in a kind of Tragedy-Rant, till Isabella appears to unravel the mystery, is surely much less natural than the minute detail of circumstances, so finely produced by our Author. It is, says Donatus, the greatest praise, when the spectator may imagine those things to happen by chance, which are produced by the utmost industry of the Poet. Exeunt Chremes and Crito. Simo. Why do you not give orders instantly To bring her to our house? Pam. Th'advice is good. I'll give that charge to Davus. Simo. It can't be. Pam. Why? Simo. He has other business of his own, Of nearer import to himself. Pam. What business? Simo. He's bound. Pam. Non RECTE vinctus est.-haud ita jussi. The conceit in the original is a Pun upon the word recte, impossible to be preserved exactly in the translation. Donatus observes very well on this passage, that the jocularity of the old gentleman on this occasion, is a characteristick mark of his thorough reconciliation. Bound! how, Sir! Simo. How, sir?—neck and heels. Pam. Ah, let him be enlarg'd! Simo. It shall be done. Pam. But instantly. Simo. I'll in, and order it. [Exit. Pam. Oh what a happy, happy, day is this! SCENE VI. He who undertakes to conduct two intrigues at a time, imposes on himself the necessity of unravelling them both at the same instant. If the principal concludes first, that which remains can support itself no longer: if, on the contrary the episode abandons the main part of the fable, there arises another inconvenience; some of the characters either disappear without reason, or shew themselves again to no end or purpose; so that the piece becomes maimed or uninteresting. Diderot. The first of the inconveniences above mentioned is that which occurs in the conclusion of this play. The discovery once made, and Glycerium given to Pamphilus, all that remains becomes cold. From the extreme brevity of this last scene, one would imagine that the Poet himself found this part of the fable languish under his hands. Some of the commentators, fond of that tediousness, which Terence was so studious to avoid, have added seventeen spurious lines of dialogue between Charinus and Chremes. But Donatus, tho' he approved of this underplot, which Terence added to the fable of Menander, yet commends his judgment in avoiding prolixity, by settling only one marriage on the stage, and dispatching the other behind the scenes. But surely the whole episode of Charinus is unnecessary, and the fable would be more clear, more compact, and more complete without it. See the first note to the second act. The fifth act of Baron is an almost literal, though very elegant version, of this of our Author. It is very remarkable, that though Terence is generally considered to be a grave author, as writer of Comedy, the Andrian has much more humour and pleasantry, than either the English or French imitation of it. Enter CHARINUS behind. Char. I come to see what Pamphilus is doing: And there he is! Pam. And is this true?—Yes, yes, I know 'tis true, because I wish it so. This whole sentence is transferred by our Poet to this play from the Eunuch of Menander: and to this practice alludes the objection mentioned in the Prologue. That Fables should not be contaminated. Donatus. Therefore I think the life of Gods eternal, For that their joys are permanent: and now, The passage in Shakespeare's Othello, from which I have borrowed this line, is a kind of contrast to this in our Author. Each of them are speeches of the highest joy and rapture, and each of them founded on the instability of human happiness; but in my mind the English Poet has the advantage. —If I were now to die, 'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear, My soul hath her content so absolute, That not another comfort, like to this, Succeeds in unknown fate. There is a passage in Otway's Orphan, which is, I think, a palpable imitation of a speech of Pamphilus, at the conclusion of the first act of this play. As it happened to be omitted in that place, I have subjoined it to this note; and if the reader will take the pains to turn back to page 29, he may compare the two speeches together. Chamont. When our dear Parents died, they died together, One fate surpriz'd them, and one grave receiv'd them: My father with his dying breath bequeath'd Her to my love: My mother, as she lay Languishing by him, call'd me to her side, Took me in her fainting arms, wept, and embrac'd me; Then prest me close, and as she observ'd my tears, Kist them away: Said she, Chamont, my son, By this, and all the love I ever shew'd thee, Be careful of Monimia, watch her youth, Let not her wants betray her to dishonour. Perhaps kind heav'n may raise some friend—then sigh'd, Kist me again; so blest us, and expir'd. My soul hath her content so absolute, That I too am immortal, if no ill Step in betwixt me and this happiness. Oh, for a bosom-friend now to pour out My ecstasies before him! Char. What's this rapture? [listening. Pam. Oh, yonder's Davus: nobody more welcome: For he, I know, will join in transport with me. SCENE THE LAST. Enter DAVUS. Davus entering.] Where's Pamphilus? Pam. Oh Davus! Davus. Who's there? Pam. I. Davus. Oh Pamphilus! Pam. You know not my good fortune. Davus. Do you know my ill-fortune? Pam. To a tittle. Davus. 'Tis after the old fashion, that my ills Should reach your ears, before your joys reach mine. Pam. Glycerium has discover'd her relations. Davus. Oh excellent! Char. How's that? [listening. Pam. Her father is Our most near friend. Davus. Who? Pam. Chremes. Davus. Charming news! Pam. And I'm to marry her immediately. Char. Is this man talking in his sleep, and dreams On what he wishes waking? [listening. Pa. And moreover, For the child, Davus— Davus. Ah, sir, say no more. You're th'only fav'rite of the Gods. Char. I'm made If this be true. I'll speak to them. [comes forward. Pam. Who's there? Charinus! oh, well met. Char. I give you joy. Pam. You've heard then— Char. Ev'ry word: and prithee now, In your good fortune, think upon your friend. Chremes is now your own; and will perform Whatever you shall ask. Pam. I shall remember. 'Twere tedious to expect his coming forth: Along with me then to Glycerium! Davus, do you go home, and hasten them To fetch her hence. Away, away! Davus I go. [Exeunt Pam. and Char. [Davus addressing the audience. Wait not till they come forth: Within She'll be betroth'd, within, if ought remains Undone, 'twill be concluded.—Clap your hands! Plaudite. All the old Tragedies and Comedies acted at Rome concluded in this manner. Donec Cantor vos Plaudite dicat, says Horace. Who the Cantor was is matter of dispute. Mons. Dacier thinks it was the whole Chorus; others suppose it to have been a single Actor; some the Prompter, and some the Composer. Before the word Plaudite in all the old copies is an ?, which has also given rise to several learned conjectures. It is most probable according to the notion of Madam Dacier, that this ?, being the last Letter of the Greek Alphabet, was nothing more than the mark of the transcriber to signify the end, like the Latin word Finis in modern books: or it might, as Cook supposes, stand for ????, Cantor, denoting that the following word Plaudite, was spoken by him. Calliopius Recensui.] After Plaudite, in all the old copies of Terence, stand these two words: which signify, “I Calliopius have revised and corrected this piece.” And this proceeds from the custom of the old criticks, who carefully revised all manuscripts: and when they had read and corrected any work, certified the same by placing their names at the end of it. Dacier.</field>
