      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. A Room in Don Alonso's House at Madrid.â Enter Alonso and OtaÃ±ez, meeting. Otan. My own dear master! Alon. Welcome, good OtaÃ±ez, My old and trusty servant! Otan. Have I liv'd To see what I so long have long'd to see, My dear old master home again! Alon. You could not Long for't, OtaÃ±ez, more than I myself. What wonder, when my daughters, who, you know, Are the two halves that make up my whole heart, Silently call'd me home, and silently (For maiden duty still gagg'd filial love) Out of the country shade where both have grown, Urg'd me to draw the blossom of their youth Where it might ripen in its proper day. Otan. Indeed, indeed, sir. Oh that my dear lady Were but alive to see this happy hour! Alon. Nay, good OtaÃ±ez, mar it not recalling What, ever sleeping in the memory, Needs but a word to waken into tears. God have her in his keeping! He best knows How I have suffer'd since the king, my master, Despatching me with charge to Mexico, I parted from her ne'er to see her more; And now come back to find her gone for ever! You know 'twas not the long and roaring seas Frighted her for herself, but these two girlsâ For them she stay'dâand full of years and honour Died, when God will'd! and I have hasten'd home Well as I may, to take into my hands The charge death slipp'd from hers. Otan. Your own good self! Though were there ever father, who could well Have left that charge to others, it was you, Your daughters so religiously brought up In convent with their aunt at AlcalÃ¡. Well, you are come, and God be prais'd for it! And, at your bidding, here are they, and I, And good old Mari NuÃ±oâall come up To meet you at Madrid. I could not wait The coach's slower pace, but must spur on To kiss my old master's hand. Alon. Myself had gone To meet them; but despatches of the king's Prevented me. They're well? Voices (within). Make way thereâway! Otan. And lovely as the dawn. And hark! are here To answer for themselves. Enter Clara, Eugenia, Mari NuÃ±o, as from travel. Clara (kneeling). Sir, and my fatherâby my daily prayers Heav'n, won at last in suffering me to kiss These honour'd hands, leaves me no more to ask, Than at these honour'd feet to die, With its eternal blessing afterward. Eug. And I, my father, grateful as I am To Heav'n, for coming to your feet once more, Have yet this more to askâto live with you For many, many happy years to come! Alon. Oh, not in vain did nature fix the heart In the mid bosom, like a sun to move Each circling arm with equal love around! Come to themâone to eachâand take from me Your lives anew. God bless you! Come, we are here together in Madrid, And in the sphere where you were born to move. This is the house that is to be your own Until some happy lover calls you his; Till which I must be father, lover, husband, In one. Brigida! Enter Brigida. Brig. Sir? Alon. My daughters' rooms Are ready? Brig. Ay, sir, as the sky itself For the sun's coming. Alon. Go and see them then, And tell me how you like what I have bought, And fitted up for your reception. Clara. I thank you, sir, and bless this happy day, Though leaving my lov'd convent far away. Eug. (aside). And I twice bless it, that no longer hid In a dull cell, I come to see Madrid. [Exeunt Clara and Eugenia. Mari NuÃ±o. Now the young ladies, sir, have had their turn, Shall not I kiss your hand? Alon. Oh, welcome too, Good Mari NuÃ±o; who have been so long A mother to them both. And, by the by, Good Mari NuÃ±o, now we are alone, I'd hear from you, who know them both so well, Their several characters and dispositions, And not, as 'twere, come blindfold to the charge That Heav'n has laid upon me. Mari. You say well, sir. Well, I might say at once, and truly too, That nothing need be said in further praise But that they are your daughters. But to pass, Lest you should think I flatter, From general to individual, And to begin with the eldest, Donna Clara; Eldest in years and in discretion too, Indeed the very pearl of prudence, sir, And maidenly reserve; her eyes still fixt On earth in modesty, or heav'n in prayer; As gentle as a lamb, almost as silent; And never known to say an angry word: And, such her love of holy quietude, Unless at your desire, would never leave Her cloister and her missal. She's, in short, An angel upon earth, whom to be near And wait on, one would sell oneself a slave. So much for her. Donna Eugenia, Though unexceptionable in heart and head, As, God forgive me, any child of yours Must be, is different,ânot for me to say Better or worse,âbut very different: Of a quick spirit, loving no control; Indeed, as forward as the other shy; Quick to retort, and sharply; so to speak, Might sometimes try the patience of a saint; Longing to leave a convent for the world, To see and to be seen; makes verses too; Would not object, I think, to have them made (Or love, may be) to herâyou understand; Not that I mean to sayâ Alon. Enough, enough. Thanks for your caution as your commendation: How could I fortify against weak points Unless I knew of them? And, to this end, Although Eugenia be the younger sister, I'll see her married first; husband and children The best specific for superfluous youth: And to say truth, good Mari, the very day Of my arrival hither, I despatch'd A letter to my elder brother's son, Who still maintains our dwindled patrimony Up in the mountains, which I would reclaim, Or keep it rather in its lawful line, By an alliance with a child of mine. All falls out luckily. Eugenia Wedded to him shall make herself secure, And the two stems of Cuadradillos so Unite and once more flourish, at a blow. [Exeunt. Scene II. A Room in Don Felix's House: Don Felix, and Hernando dressing him. Hern. Such fine ladies, sir, come to be our neighbours. Fel. So they ought to be, such a noise as they made in coming. Hern. One of them already betroth'd, however. Fel. So let her, and married too, if she would only let me sleep quiet. But what kind of folks are they? Hern. Oh, tip-top. Daughters of the rich old Indian has bought the house and gardens opposite, and who will give them all his wealth when they marry, which they say he has brought them to Madrid expressly to do. Fel. But are they handsome? Hern. I thought so, sir, as I saw them alighting. Fel. Rich and handsome then? Hern. Yes, sir. Fel. Two good points in a woman, at all events, of which I might profit, such opportunities as I have. Hern. Have a care, sir, for the old servant who told me this, told me also that the papa is a stout fiery old fellow, who'd stick the Great Turk himself if he caught him trifling with his daughters. Fel. That again is not so well; for though I'm not the Great Turk, I've no mind to share that part of his fortune. But of the two girls, what said your old servant? who, as such, I suppose told you all that was amiss in them at least. Hern. Well, you shall judge. One, the oldest, is very discreet. Fel. Ah, I told you so. Hern. The other lively. Fel. Come, that sounds better. One can tackle her hand to hand, but the grave one one can only take a long shot at with the eyes. Hern. Whichever it be, I should like to see you yourself hit one of these days, sir. Fel. Me? The woman is not yet cast who will do that. If I meddle with these it is only because they lie so handy. Hern. And handsome as well as handy! Fel. Pooh! I wouldn't climb a wall to pluck the finest fruit in the world. But hark! some one's at the door. See who 'tis. Enter Don Juan in travelling dress. Juan. I, Felix, who seeing your door open, could not but walk in without further ado. Fel. You know that it and my heart are ever open to you. Welcome, welcome, Don Juan! all the more welcome for being unexpected: for though I had heard we might one day have you back, I did not think to see you yet. Juan. Why, the truth is I got my pardon sooner than I expected. Fel. Though not than I prayed for. But tell me all about it. Juan. You know I was obliged to fly to Italy after that unlucky duel. Well, there the great duke of Terranova, who (as good luck would have it) was then going ambassador to Hungary, took a fancy to me, and carried me with him; and, pleased with what service I did him, interested himself in my fortunes, and one good day, when I was least expecting it, with his own hand put my pardon into mine. Fel. A pardon that never should have needed asking, all of an unlucky quarrel at cards. Juan. So you and the world suppose, Felix: but in truth there was something more behind. Fel. Ah? Juan. Why the truth is, I was courting a fair lady, and with fair hope of success, though she would not confess it, urging that her father being away at the time, her mother would not consent in his absence. Suddenly I found I had a rival, and took occasion of a casual dispute at cards to wipe out the score of jealousy; which I did with a vengeance to both of us, he being killed on the spot, and I, forc'd to fly the country, must, I doubt, ere this, have died out of my lady's memory, where only I cared to live. Fel. Ay, you know well enough that in Madrid Oblivion lies in the very lap of Remembrance, whether of love or loathing. I thank my stars I never pinn'd my faith on woman yet. Juan. Still the same sceptic? Fel. Ay, they are fine things, but my own heart's ease is finer still; and if one party must be deceived, I hold it right in self-defence it should not be I. But come; that you may not infect me with your faith, nor I you with my heresy, tell me about your journey. Juan. How could it be otherwise than a pleasant one, such pageants as I had to entertain me by the way? Fel. Oh, you mean our royal master's nuptials? Juan. Ay! Fel. I must hear all about them, Juan; even now, upon the spot. Juan. Well then, you know at least, without my telling you, how great a debt Germany has owed usâ Enter Don Pedro hastily. Ped. My dear Don Felix! Fel. Don Pedro! By my faith, my door must be the door of heaven, I think; for all the good keep coming in by't. But how comes your University term so soon over? Ped. Alas, it's not over, butâ Fel. Well? Ped. I'll tell you. Juan. If I be in your wayâ Ped. No, no, sir, if you are Felix's friend you command my confidence. My story is easily told. A lady I am courting in AlcalÃ¡ is suddenly come up to Madrid, and I am come after her. And to escape my father's wrath at playing truant, I must beg sanctuary in your house awhile. Fel. And this once will owe me thanks for your entertainment, since I have Don Juan's company to offer you. Juan. Nay, 'tis I have to thank you for Don Pedro's. Fel. Only remember, both of you, that however you may amuse one another, you are not to entertain me with your several hearts and darts. Hernando, get us something to eat; and till it comes you shall set off rationally at least, Juan, with the account of the royal nuptials you were beginning just as Don Pedro came in. Juan. On condition you afterwards recount to me your rejoicings in Madrid meanwhile. Fel. Agreed. Ped. I come in happy time to hear you both. Juan. You know, as I was saying, what a debt Germany has ow'd us since our fair Maria Her title of the Royal Child of Spain Set in the crown of Hungaryâa debt They only could repay us as they do, Returning us one of the self-same stock, So like herself in beauty and desert, We seem but taking what we gave away. If into Austria's royal hand we gave Our royal rose, she now returns us one Sprung of the self-same stem, as fair, as sweet In maiden graces; and if double-dyed In the imperial purple, yet so fresh, She scarce has drunk the dawns of fourteen Aprils. The marriage contract sign'd, the marriage self Delay'd, too long for loyal Spain's desire, That like the bridegroom for her coming burn'd, (But happiness were hardly happiness Limp'd it not late,) till her defective years Reach'd their due blossomâAh, happy defect, That every uncondition'd hour amends! At last arose the dayâthe day of daysâ When from her royal eyrie in the North The imperial eaglet flew. Young Ferdinand, King of Bohemia and Hungary Elect, who not in vain Rome's holy hand Awaits to bind the laurel round his brow, As proxy for our king espous'd her first, And then, all lover-like, as far as Trent Escorted her, with such an equipage As when the lords and princes of three realms Out-do each other in magnificence Of gold and jewel, ransackt from the depths Of earth and sea, to glitter in the eye Of Him who sees and lights up all from heav'n. So, like a splendid star that trails her light Far after her, she cross'd fair Italy, When Doria, Genoa's great Admiral, Always so well-affected to our crown, Took charge of her sea-conduct; which awhile, Till winds and seas were fair, she waited for In Milan; till, resolv'd on embarkation, The sea, that could not daunt her with his rage, Soon as her foot was on his yellow shore, Call'd up his Tritons and his Nereids Who love and make a calm, to smooth his face And still his heaving breast; on whose blue flood The golden galley in defiance burn'd, Her crew in wedding pearl and silver drest; Her silken sail and cordage, fluttering With myriad flags and streamers of all dye, Sway'd like a hanging garden over-head, Amid whose blossoms stood the royal bride, A fairer Venus than did ever float Over the seas to her dominions Arm'd with the arrows of diviner love. Then to the sound of trump and clarion The royal galley, and with her forty more That follow'd in her wake as on their queen, Weigh'd, shook out sail, and dipp'd all oars at once, Making the flood clap hands in acclamation; And so with all their streamers, as 'twere spring Floating away to other hemispheres, Put out to sea; and touching not the isles That gem the midway deepânot from distrust Of friendly France in whose crown they are set, And who (as mighty states contend in peace With courtesies as with hard blows in war) Swell'd the triumphal tide with pageantries I may not stop to tellâbut borne upon, And (as I think) bearing, fair wind and wave, The moving city on its moving base With sail and oar enter'd the Spanish Main, Which, flashing emerald and diamond, Leap'd round the golden prow that clove between, And kiss'd the happy shore that first declin'd To meet its mistress. Happy Denia, That in her golden sand holds pearly-like The first impression of that royal foot! I will not tellâlet Felix, who was here, And has new breathâhow, landed happily, Our loyal Spainâyea, with what double welcomeâ Receiv'd the niece and consort of our king, Whom, one and both, and both in one, may Heav'n Bless with fair issue, and all happiness, For years and years to come! Enter Hernando. Hern. Sir, sir! Fel. Well? Hern. Your two new neighboursâjust come to the window. Fel. Gentlemen, we must waive my story then, for, as the proverb goes, âMy Lady first.â (He looks out.) By Heaven, they are divine! Juan. Let me see. (Aside.) By Heaven, 'tis she! Ped. Come, it is my turn now. (Aside.) Eugenia! I must keep it to myself. Fel. I scarce know which is handsomest. Juan. Humph! both pretty girls enough. Ped. Yes, very well. Fel. Listen, gentlemen; whether handsome, or pretty, or very well, or all three, you must not stare at them from my window so vehemently; being the daughters of a friend of mine, and only just come to Madrid. Juan (aside). That the first thing I should see on returning to Madrid, is she for whose love I left it! Ped. (aside). That the first thing I see here is what I came for the very purpose of seeing! Hernando (entering). Table is serv'd, sir. Fel. To table, then. I know not how it is with you, gentlemen, but for myself, my appetite is stronger than my love. Juan (aside to Felix). You jest as usual; but I assure you it is one of those very ladies on whom my fortune turns! [Exit. Fel. Adieu to one then. Ped. All this is fun to you, Felix; but believe me, one of those ladies is she I have followed from AlcalÃ¡. [Exit. Fel. Adieu to both thenâunless indeed you are both of you in love with the same. But, thank God, I that am in love with neither, Need not plague myself for either. The least expense of rhyme or care That man can upon woman spare. But they are very handsome nevertheless. [Exit. Scene III. An Apartment in Don Alonso's House.â Enter Clara and Eugenia. Clara. Is't not a pretty house, Eugenia, And all about it? Eug. I dare say you think so. Clara. But do not you then? Eug. Noâto me it seems A sort of out-court and repository, Fit but for old Hidalgos and Duennas, Too stale and wither'd for the blooming world, To wear away in. Clara. I like its quietude; This pretty garden too. Eug. A pretty thing To come for to Madridâa pretty garden! I tell you were it fuller of all flowers Than is a Dutchman's in his tulip-time, I want the lively street whose flowers are shops, Carriages, soldiers, ladies, cavaliers, Plenty of dust in summer, dirt in winter, And where a woman sitting at her blind Sees all that passes. Then this furniture! Clara. Wellâsurely velvet curtains, sofas, chairs, Rich Indian carpets, beds of Damascene, Chandeliers, gilded mirrors, pictures tooâ What would you have, Eugenia? Eug. All very well, But, after all, no marvellous result Of ten years spent in golden India. Why, one has heard how fine a thing it is To be my Lord Mayor's daughter; what must be, Methought, to own a dowry from Peru! And when you talk about the furniture, Pictures, chairs, carpets, mirrors, and all thatâ The best of all is wanting. Clara. What is that? Eug. Why, a coach, woman! Heav'n and earth, a coach! What use is all the money-bonds and gold He has been boasting of in all his letters, Unless, now come at last, he plays the part We've heard so long rehearsing? Clara. Not to spare Your father even, Eugenia! For shame! 'Tis time to tie your roving tongue indeed. Consider, too, we are not in the country, Where tongue and eyes, Eugenia, may run wild Without offence to uncensorious woods; But in a city, with its myriad eyes Inquisitively turn'd to watch, and tongues As free and more malicious than yours To tellâwhere honour's monument is wax, And shame's of brass. I know, Eugenia, High spirits are not in themselves a crime; But if to men they seem so?âthat's the question. For it is almost better to do ill With a good outward grace than well without; Especially a woman; most of all One not yet married; whose reputation One breath of scandal, like a flake of snow, May melt away; one of those tenderest flowers Whose leaves ev'n the warm breath of flattery Withers as fast as envy's bitterest wind, That surely follows short-liv'd summer praise. Ev'n those who praise your beauty, grace, or wit, Will be the first, if you presume on them, To pull the idol down themselves set up, Beginning with malicious whispers first, Until they join the storm themselves have rais'd. And most if one be giv'n oneself to laugh And to make laugh: the world will doubly yearn To turn one's idle giggle into tears. I say this all by way of warning, sister, Now we are launcht upon this dangerous sea. Consider of it. Eug. âWhich that all may do May Heav'nââ Come, Clara, if the sermon's done, Pray finish it officially at once, And let us out of church. These homilies In favour of defunct proprieties, Remind one of old ruff and armour worn By Don Punctilio and Lady Etiquette A hundred years ago, and past with them And all their tedious ancestors for ever. I am alive, young, handsome, witty, rich, And come to town, and mean to have my fling, Not caring what malicious people say, If nothing true to say against my honour. And so with all sail set, and streamers flying, (A coach shall be my ship, and I will have it!) I mean to glide along the glittering streets And down the Prado, as I go along Capturing what eyes and hearts I find by the way, Heedless of every little breath of scandal That such as you turn back affrighted by. I'll know the saints' days better than the saints Themselves; the holidays and festivals Better than over-done apprentices. If a true lover comes whom I can like As he loves me, I shall not turn away: As for the rest who flutter round in love, Not with myself, but with my father's wealth, Or with themselves, or any thing but me, You shall see, Clara, how I'll play with them, Till, having kept them on my string awhile For my own sport, I'll e'en turn them adrift And let them go, the laugh all on my side. And therefore when you seeâ Clara. How shall I dare To see what even now I quake to hear! Enter Alonso. Alon. Clara! Eugenia! Both. Sir? Alon. Good news, good news, my girls! What think you? My nephew, Don Torribio Cuadradillos, my elder brother's elder son, head of our family and inheritor of the estate, is coming to visit me; will be here indeed almost directly. What think you now! Eug. (aside). One might have thought, from such a flourish of trumpets, the king was coming at least. Alon. Mari NuÃ±o! Mari (entering). Sir? Alon. Let a chamber be got ready for my nephew, Don Torribio, directly. Brigida! Brig. (entering). Sir? Alon. See that linen be taken up into Don Torribio's room. OtaÃ±ez, have dinner ready for my nephew, Don Torribio, directly he arrives. And you two, (to his daughters,) I expect you will pay him all attention; as head of the family, consider. Ay, and if he should take a fancy to one of youâI know not he willâbut if he should, I say, whichever it be, she will take precedence of her sister for ever. (Aside.) This I throw out as a bait for Eugenia. Eug. It must be Clara, then, sir, for she is oldest you know. Clara. Not in discretion and all wife-like qualities, Eugenia. Eug. Clara! Alon. Hark! in the court! Don Torribio (speaking loud within). Hoy! good man there! Can you tell me if my uncle lives hereabout? Alon. 'Tis my nephew, surely! Torr. (within). Why, fellow, I mean of course Don Alonso âwho has two daughters, by the token I'm to marry one of 'em. Alon. 'Tis he! I will go and receive him. [Exit. Torr. (within). Very well then. Hold my stirrup, Lorenzo. Eug. What a figure! Enter Alonso and Torribio. Alon. My nephew, Don Torribio, giving thanks to Heaven for your safe arrival at my house, I hasten to welcome you as its head. Torr. Ay, uncle, and a head taller, I promise you, than almost any body in the parish. Alon. Let me introduce your cousins to you, who are so anxious for your acquaintance. Torr. Ah, that's proper of 'em, isn't it? Both. Welcome, sir. Alon. And how are you, nephew? Torr. Very tired, I promise you: for the way is long and my horse a rough goer, so as I've lost leather. Alon. Sit down, and rest till they bring dinner. Torr. Sitting an't the way to mend it. But, howeverâ (Sits.) Nay, though I be head of the house, I an't proudâ you can all of you sit down too. Clara (aside). Amiable humility! Eug. (aside). No wonder the house is crazy if this be its head! Torr. Well, now I come to look at you, cousins, I may say you are both of you handsome girls, indeed; which 'll put me to some trouble. Clara. How so, cousin? Torr. Why, didn't you ever hear that if you put an ass between two bundles of hay, he'll die without knowing which to begin on, eh? Alon. His father's pleasant humour! Clara. A courteous comparison! Eug. (aside). Which holds as far as the ass at least. Torr. Well, there's a remedy. I say, uncle, mustn't cousins get a dispensation before they marry? Alon. Yes, nephew. Torr. Well then, when you're about it, you can get two dispensations, and I can marry both my cousins. Aha! Well, but, uncle, how are you? I had forgot to ask you that. Alon. Quite well, in seeing you in my house at last, and to reap, I trust, the fruits of all my travel. Torr. Ah, you may say that. Oh, cousins, if you could only see my pedigree and patent, in a crimson velvet case; and all my forefathers painted in a rowâI have it in my saddle bags, and if you'll wait a minuteâ Enter Mari NuÃ±o. Mari. Dinner's ready. Torr. (looking at Mari). Lord a' mercy, uncle, what's this? something you brought from India, belike; does it speak? Alon. Nay, nephew, 'tis our Duenna. Torr. A what? Alon. A Duenna. Torr. A tame one? Alon. Come, come, she tells us dinner's ready. Torr. Yes, if you believe her; but I've heard say, Duennas always lie. However, I'll go and see for myself. [Exit. Clara. What a cousin! Eug. What a lover! Mari. Foh! I wonder how the watch came to let the plague into the city! [Exit. Alon. You are silent, both of you? Both. Not I, sir. Alon. I understand you; Don Torribio Pleases you notâwell, he's a little rough; But wait a little; see what a town life Will do for him; all come up so at first, The finest diamonds, you know, the roughestâ Oh, I rejoice my ancestor's estate Shall to my grandchildren revert again! For this I tell youâone, I care not which, But one of you, shall marry Don Torribio: And let not her your cousin does not choose, For one more courtly think herself reserv'd; By Heaven she shall marry, if e'er marry, One to the full as rough and country-like. What, I to see my wealth, so hardly won, Squander'd away by some fine town gallant, In silks and satins! see my son-in-law Spend an estate upon a hat and feather! I tell you I'll not have it. One of you Must marry Don Torribio. [Exit. Clara. I'll die first. Eug. And I'll live an old maidâwhich much is worst?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. A Room in Don Felix's House.âFelix and Hernando; to whom Enter Juan. Fel. Well, Juan, and how slept you? Juan. As one must In your house, Felix; had not such a thought No house can quiet woke me long ere dawn. Fel. Indeed! How so? Juan. Felix, the strangest thingâ But now we are alone I'll tell you all. Last nightâthe very moment that I saw That angel at the window, as at Heaven's gateâ The fire that I myself had thought half dead Under the ashes of so long an absence, Sprung up anew into full blaze. Alas! But one brief moment did she dawn on us, Then set, to rise no more all the evening, Watch as I would. But day is come again, And as I think, Felix, the holyday When our new Queen shall make her solemn entry Into Madrid; and she, my other Queen, Will needs be upâbe up and out betimes; So I forestall the sun in looking for her, And now will to the door beneath her window Better to watch her rising. But, as you love me, not a word of this Breathe to Don Pedro. [Exit. Fel. And does he think Because his memory of her is quick, Hers is of him? Aha! Hern. Nay, if he like it, âOh let him be deceiv'd!â Fel. 'Twas wisely said By him who self-deception us'd to call The cheapest and the dearest thing of all. Ha! here's the other swain! and now to see How he has prosper'd. I begin to think My house is turn'd into a Lazar-house Of crazy lovers. (Enter Pedro.) Good day, Don Pedro. Ped. As it needs must be To one who hails it in your house, and opposite My lady's! Oh, you cannot think, my Felix, With what a blessed conscience of all this I woke this morning! I can scarcely believe 't. Why, in your house, I shall have chance on chance, Nay, certainty of seeing herâto-day Most certainly. But I'll go post myself Before the door; she will be out betimes To mass. Fel. Well, you will find Don Juan there. Ped. Eh? Well, so much the better, I can do't With less suspicion, nay, with none at all If you will go with us. Only, Don Felix, Breathe not a word to him about my love. As he is going, re-enter Juan. Fel. Juan again? Juan. I only came to ask What church we go to? (Aside to Fel.) Let us keep at home. Fel. Don Pedro, what say you? Ped. Oh, where you please. (Aside.) Stir not! Fel. (aside). How easy to oblige two friends Who ask the same, albeit with diverse ends! (Aloud.) What, are your worships both in love, perhaps, As Spanish cavaliers are bound to be, And think I've nothing else to do, forsooth, Than follow each upon his wildgoose chase? Forgetting I may take 't into my head To fall in love myselfâperhaps with one, Or both, of those fair ladies chance has brought Before my windows. Now I think upon't, I am, or mean to be, in love with one; And, to decide with which, I'll e'en wait here Till they both sally forth to church themselves. So, gentlemen, would you my company, I must not go with you, you stay with me. Ped. Willingly. Juan. Oh, most willingly! (Aside to Fel.) How well You manag'd it. Ped. (aside to Fel.) 'Tis just as I could wish. Fel. (aside). And just as I, if thereby I shall learn Whether they love the same; and, if the same, Whether the oneâBut come, come! 'tis too late For wary me to wear love's cap and bells. Juan. Since we must do your bidding on this score, We'll e'en make you do ours upon another, And make you tell us, as you promis'd both, And owe to meâwhat, when our Queen was landed, You fine folks of Madrid did in her honour. Ped. Ay, if you needs will fetter our free time, Help us at least to pass it by the story You had begun. Fel. Well then, to pick it up Where Juan left it for us, on the shore. There, when our Queen was landed, as I hear, The Countess Medellin, her Chamberlain, Of the Cordona family, receiv'd her, And the Lord Admiral on the King's part, With pomp that needed no excuse of haste, And such a retinue (for who claims not To be the kinsman, friend, or follower, Of such a name?) as I believe Castile Was almost drain'd to follow in his wake. Oh, noble house! in whom the chivalry Of courage, blameless worth, and loyalty, Is nature's patent of inheritance From generation to generation! And so through ringing Spain, town after town, And every town a triumph, on they pass'd. Madrid meanwhileâ Juan. Stop, stop! They're coming out! Ped. Where! Let me see. Juan. The servant only. Fel. Nay, They'll follow soon. Juan. Till when, on with your story. Fel. Madrid then, sharing in the general joy Of her king's marriage, and with one whose mother Herself had nurstâthough, as you said, half sick Of hope deferr'd, had, at the loyal call, That never fails in Spain, drawn to her heart The life-blood of the realm's nobility To do her honour; not only when she came, But, in anticipation of her coming, With such prelusive pomps, as if you turn Far up time's stream as history can go, In hymeneals less august than these, You shall find practis'dâtorchÃ©d troop and masque, With solemn and preliminary dance, Epithalamium and sacrifice, Invoking Hymen's blessing. So Madrid, Breathing new Christian life in Pagan pomp, With such epithalamium as all Spain Rais'd up to Heav'n, into sweet thunder tun'd Beyond all science by a people's love, Began her pageant. First, the nightly masque, So fair as I have never seen the like, Nor shall again; nor which, unless you draw On your imagination for the type Of what I tell, can I depict to you; When, to the sound of trumpet and recorder, The chiming poles of Spain and Germany Beginning, drew the purple mountain down, Glittering with veins of ore and silver trees, All flower'd with plumes, and taper-starr'd above, With monster and volcano breathing fire, While to and fro torch-bearing maskers ran Like meteors; all so illuminating night, That the succeeding sun hid pale in cloud, And wept with envy, till he dawn'd at length Upon the famous Amphitheatre, Which, in its masonry out-doing all That Rome of a like kind in ruin shows, This day out-did itself, In number, rank, and glory of spectators, Magnificence of retinue, multitude, Size, beauty, and courage, of the noble beasts Who came to dye its yellow dust with blood; As each horn'd hero of the cloven hoof, Broad-chested, and thick-neckt, and wrinkle-brow'd, Rush'd roaring in, and tore the ground with's foot, As saying, âLo! this grave is yours or mine!â While that yet nobler beast, noblest of all, Who knights the very knighthood that he carries, Proud in submission to a nobler will, Spurn'd all his threats, and, touch'd by the light spur, His rider glittering like a god aloft, Turn'd onset into death. Fight follow'd fight, Till darkness came at last, sending Madrid Already surfeited with joy, to dream Of greater, not unanxious that the crown And centre of the centre of the world Should not fall short of less renowned cities In splendour of so great a celebration; While too the hundreds of a hundred nations, In wonder or in envy cramm'd her streets; Until her darling come at last, whose spouse Shall lay his own two empires at her feet, And crown her thrice; as Niece, and Spouse, and Queen. Juan. A charming story, finish just in time, For look! (They look out.) Fel. That is the father, Don Alonso. Juan. Indeed! Ped. (aside). That's he then! But that strange man with him, Who's he? Hern. Oh, I can tell you that; His nephew, an Asturian gentleman, Betroth'd to one of the daughters. Juan (aside). Not to mine! Ped. (aside). Not my Eugenia, or by Heav'nâ But we shall scarcely see them, Felix, here, Wrapt in their mantles too. Fel. And I would pay My compliment to Don Alonso. Juan. Come, Let us go down with you into the street. (Aside.) Oh love, that in her memory survive One thought of me, not dead if scarce alive! Ped. (aside). Oh, may her bosom whisper her 'tis still Her eyes that draw me after where they will! [Exeunt. Scene II. Street between the Houses of Alonso and Felix: Alonso and Torribio waiting. Alon. If you really affect Eugenia, nephew,â(aside) as I wished,âI will communicate with her after church, and if all be well (as I cannot doubt) get a dispensation forthwith. But they are coming. Enter from Alonso's door Clara, Eugenia in mantles, the latter with a handkerchief in her hand; Mari NuÃ±o, Brigida, and OtaÃ±ez behind; and at the same time Felix, Juan, and Pedro opposite. Clara. Cover your face, Eugenia. People in the street. Eug. Well, I'm not ashamed of it. (Aside.) Don Pedro! and Don Juan! Fel. (whispers). Which is it, Don Juan? Juan. She with the handkerchief in her hand. I'll go wait for her at the church. [Exit. Ped. (to Juan). That is she with the white kerchief in her hand. I'll follow them. Fel. (aside). The same, then! Clara. Eugenia, lend me your handkerchief, it is hot. (Takes the handkerchief and uncovers her face towards Felix.) And let us go, and do not you look behind you. Fel. And she I most admired. [Exeunt Clara, Eugenia, &amp;c., Pedro after them. Torr. Uncle, what are these fellows hanging about our doors for? Alon. Nay, 'tis the public street, you know. Torr. What, my cousins' street? Alon. To be sure. Torr. I'll not suffer any one I don't like to hang about it, however, and least of all these perfumery puppies. Alon. But if they happen to live here, nephew? Torr. Don't let 'em live here, then. Alon. But if they own houses? Torr. They mustn't own houses, then. Fel. Don Alonso, permit me to kiss your hand on your arrival among us. I ought indeed first to have waited upon you in your own house; but this happy chance makes me anticipate etiquette. Torr. Coxcomb! Alon. Thank you, sir; had I known you intended me such a favour, I should have anticipated your anticipation by waiting upon you. Give me leave to present to you my nephew, Don Torribio de Cuadradillos, who will also be proud of your acquaintance. Torr. No such thing, I shan't at all. Alon. Nephew, nephew! Fel. I trust you are well, sir? Torr. Oh, so, so, thank ye, for the matter of that, neither well nor ill, but mixt-like. (Alonso salutes Felix and exit with Torribio.) Fel. Now then, I know both face, and dress, and name, And that my rival friends both love the same; The same too that myself of the fair pair Thought yester-eve the fairest of the fair: Was't not enough for my two friends that they Turn enemiesâmust I too join the fray? Oh, how at once to reconcile all three, Those two with one another, and with me! Re-enter Juan hastily. Juan. On seeing me, my friend, her colour chang'd: She loves me still, Don Felix! I am sure She loves me! Is not the faceâwe know it is, The tell-tale index of the heart within? Oh happiness! at once within your house, And next my lady's! What is now to do But catch the ball good fortune throws at us! You know her father, you will visit him Of course, and thenâand thenâwhat easier? Draw me in with you, or after youâor perhaps A letter firstâay, and then afterwardâ But why so dumb? Fel. I scarce know how to answer. Juan, you know I am too much your friend To do you any spite? Juan. How could I dream it? Enter Pedro hastily. Ped. Oh, Felix, if my loveâ Fel. (aside). The other now! He must be stopt. A moment, gentlemen, Before you speak, and let me tell you first A case of conscience you must solve for me. You both have mighty matters, I doubt not, To tell me, such as warm young gentlemen Are never at a loss for in Madrid; But I may have my difficulties too. (Aside.) The same will serve for both. Ped. Well, let us hear. Fel. Suppose some friend of yours, dear as you will, Loving your neighbour's daughterâ(such a case Will do as well as any)âask'd of you To smuggle him, his letters, or himself, Into that neighbour's house, there secretly To ply a stolen love; what would you do? Ped. Do it of course! Juan. Why not? Fel. Well, I would not. Ped. But why? Fel. Because, however it turn'd out, I must do ill; if one friend's love succeeded I had play'd traitor to the other still; If unsuccessful, not that cost alone, But also, without counter-profiting, Him whom I sacrific'd so much to serve. Ped. If that be your determination, I have no more to say. [Exit. Juan. Nor I: farewell; I must find other means. [Exit. Fel. Of all the plagues, For one with no love profit of his own Thus to be pester'd with two lovers' pains! And yet, what, after all, between the twoâ Between the three, perhaps, am I to do? Fore Heav'n, I think 'twill be the only way To get her to untie who drew the knot; No woman ever at a loss To mend or mar a matter as she wills. Yet 'tis an awkward thing to ask a lady, âPray, madam, which of these two sighing swains âDo you like best? or both? or neither, madam?â Were not a letter best? But then who take it? Since to commit her letter, would so far Commit her honour to another's hands? By Heav'n, I think I've nothing left to do, But ev'n to write it, and to take it too; A ticklish businessâbut may fair intent And prudent conduct lead to good event! [Exit. Scene III. An Apartment in Don Alonso's House.â Enter Clara, Eugenia, Mari NuÃ±o, &amp;c. Clara. Here, take my mantle, Mari. Oh, I wish we had a chaplain of our own in the house, not to go abroad through the crowded streets! Eug. And I, that church were a league of crowded street off, and we obliged to go to it daily. Mari. I agree with SeÃ±ora Clara. Brigida. And I with SeÃ±ora Eugenia. Mari. And why, pray? Brig. Oh, madam, I know who it is deals most in sheep's eyes. Enter Don Alonso. Alon. (talking to himself as he enters). How lucky he should have pitcht on the very one I wanted! (Aloud.) Oh, Eugenia, I would speak with you. Nay, retire not, Clara, for I want you to pardon me for the very thing Eugenia is to thank me for. Clara. A riddle, sir. I pardon you? Alon. Listen, both of you. Your cousin Don Torribio has declared his love for Eugenia: and though I could have wish'd to marry you, Clara, first, and to the head of our house too, yet my regret at your missing it is almost cancell'd by the joy of your sister's acceptance. Clara. And so with me, believe me, sir. I am well content to be slighted so long as she is happy: which may she be with my cousin these thousand years to come. (Aside.) Oh, providential rejection! [Exit. Torribio (peeping in). Ah! what a wry face she makes! Alon. And you, Eugenia, what say you? Eug. (aside.) Alas! surprise on surprise! (Aloud.) Nay, sir, you know, I hope, that I am ever ready to obey you. Alon. I look'd for nothing else of you. Torr. Nor I. Alon. Your cousin is waiting your answer in his chamber. I will tell him the good news, and bring him to you. [Exit. Eug. Only let him come! Alas! Torr. (entering). How lightly steps a favour'd lover forth! Give you joy, cousin. Eug. The wretch! Torr. Being selected by the head of your house. Eug. Sir, one word, I wouldn't marry you if it should cost me my life. Torr. Ah, you are witty, cousin, I know. Eug. Not to you, sir. And now especially, I mean to tell you sober truth, and abide by it, so you had better listen. I tell you once again, and once for all, I wouldn't marry you to save my life! Torr. Cousin! After what I heard you tell your father? Eug. What I said then was out of duty to him; and what I now say is out of detestation of you. Torr. I'll go and tell him this, I declare I will. Eug. Do, and I'll deny it. But I mean it all the same, and swear it. Torr. Woman, am I not your cousin? Eug. Yes. Torr. And head of the family? Eug. I dare say. Torr. An Hidalgo? Eug. Yes. Torr. Young? Eug. Yes. Torr. Gallant? Eug. Very. Torr. And dispos'd to you? Eug. Very possibly. Torr. What do you mean then? Eug. Whatever you choose, so long as you believe I mean what I say. I'll never marry you. You might be all you say, and fifty other things beside, but I'll never marry any man without a capacity. [Exit. Torr. Capacity! without a Capacity! I who have the family estate, and my ancestors painted in a row on the patent in my saddle-bags! I whoâ Enter Alonso. Alon. Well, nephew, here you are at last; I've been hunting every where to tell you the good news. Torr. And what may that be, pray? Alon. That your cousin Eugenia cordially accepts your offer, andâ Torr. Oh, indeed, does she so? I tell you she's a very odd way of doing it then. Oh uncle, she has said that to me I wouldn't say to my gelding. Alon. To you? Torr. Ay, to meâhereâon this very spotâjust now. Alon. But what? Tor. What? why, that I had no Capacity! But I'll soon settle that; I either have a Capacity or notâif I have, she lies; if not, I desire you to buy me one directly, whatever it may cost. Alon. What infatuation! Torr. What, it costs so much, does it? I don't care, I'll not have it thrown in my teeth by her or any woman; and if you won't, I'll go and buy a Capacity, and bring it back with me, let it costâay, and weighâwhat it will. [Exit. Alon. Nephew, nephew! Stom him there! Enter Clara and Eugenia. Clara. What is the matter, sir? Alon. Oh, graceless girl, what have you been saying to your cousin? Eug. I sir? Nothing. Alon. Oh! if you deceive me! But I must first stop his running after a Capacity! [Exit. Eug. What can I have done? Clara. Nay, attempt not dissimulation with me, who know how you would risk even your advancement for a sarcasm. Eug. It was all for your sake, if I did, Clara. Clara. For my sake! oh, indeed, you think I can have no lovers but what you reject? Poor little fool! I could have enough if I chose to lay out for them as some do; but many will pluck at an apple who will retire from a fortress. Eug. Hark! they are coming back; I dare not face them both as yet. [Exit. Enter Don Felix. Fel. Permit me, madamâ Clara. Who is this? Fel. One, madam, Who dares to ask one word with you. Clara. With me? Fel. Indeed with you. Clara. You cannot, sir, mean me. Fel. Once more, and once for all, with you indeed; Let me presume to say so, knowing well I say so in respect, not in presumption. Eug. (peeping). Why, whom has my staid sister got with her? Clara. With me! My very silence and surprise Bid you retire at once. Fel. Which I will do When you will let this silence speak to you With less offence perhaps than could my tongue. (Offering her a letter.) Eug. Oh, if he would but try if fort or apple! Clara. A letter too!âfor me! Fel. And, madam, one It most imports your honour you should read. For, that being once in question, I make light That my friends' lives, Don Juan and Don Pedro, Are in the balance too. Eug. Don Juan! Don Pedro! Clara. What, sir, is this to me, who neither know Don Juan, nor Don Pedro, nor yourself? Fel. Having then done my duty to my friends, And (once again I say't) to yourself, madam, Albeit in vainâI'll not offend you more By my vain presence. (Going.) Clara. Nay, a momentâwait. I must clear up this mystery. Indeed, I would not be discourteous or ungrateful: But ere I thank you for your courtesy, Know you to whom you do it? Fel. To Donna Eugenia. Clara. Well, sir? Eug. Oh, the hypocrite! Fel. You are the lady? Clara. Enoughâgive me the letter, and adieu. Eug. I can forbear no longer. (Coming out.) Sister, stop! Oh! what to do!âthe letterâ Clara. Well? Eug. I tell you My father and my cousin are coming up, And if they seeâ Clara. Well, if they see? what then! I wish them both to see and hear it all. (Calling.) Sir! Father! Cousin! OtaÃ±ez! Alon. (within). Clara's voice? Fel. What to do now? Eug. Alas, to tell the truth, When I but wish'd to lie! Clara (calling). This way, sir, here! Eug. Will you expose us both? In here! in here! [She hides Felix behind arras. Enter Alonso, Torribio, Mari NuÃ±o, OtaÃ±ez, &amp;c. Alon. What is the matter? Clara. There is some one in the house, sir. A manâI saw him stealing along the corridor, towards the garret. Brigida. It must be a robber? Alon. A robber? Mari. What more likely in a rich Indian's house? Alon. I'll search the house. Torr. I'll lead the forlorn hope, though that garret were Maestricht itself. Now, cousin, you shall see if I've a Capacity or not. [Exeunt Alonso and the men. Clara. Do you two watch in the passage. (Exeunt Mari NuÃ±o and Brigida.) And now, sir, the door is open, give me the letter and begone. Fel. Adieu, madam, neglect not its advice. Eug. Alas, alas, she has it! Fel. She's all too fair! come, honour, come, and shame False love from poaching upon friendship's game! [Exit. Re-enter Alonso, &amp;c. Alon. We can see nothing of him, daughter. Clara. Nay, sir, he probably made off when the alarm was given. Take no more trouble. Alon. Nay, we'll search the whole house. Torr. What do you say to my Capacity now, cousin? [Exeunt Alonso, Torribio, &amp;c. Clara. You see, Eugenia, in what your enterprises end. At the first crack, you faint and surrender. I have done all this to show you the difference between talking and doing. And now go; I have got the letter, and want to read it. Eug. And so do I! butâ Clara. Go! I am mistress now. (Exit Eugenia.) May they not have written to me under cover of her name? let me see. (Reads.) âLet not him offend honour by the very means he takes to secure it; at least let his good intention excuse his ill seeming. Don Juan, more than ever enamoured of you, hangs about your doors; Don Pedro follows every step you take; they are both in my house; it is impossible but the secret must soon escape both, who must then refer their rivalry to the sword, and all to the scandal of your name. You can, by simply disowning both, secure their lives, your own reputation, and my peace of mind as their friend and host. Adieu!â Oh what perplexing thoughts this little letter Buzzes about my brain, both what it says, And leaves unsaid!âoh, can it be for me? And is the quiet nun really belov'd Under the cover of an idle flirt? Or is it but for herâthe vain, pert thing, Who thinks her eye slays all it looks upon? If it be so, and she, not I, is lov'd, I yet may be reveng'dâ Eug. (entering). On whom? Clara. Eugenia! This letter that has fallen to my hands, But meant for youâ Eug. Oh, I know all about it. Clara. Know all about it! know then that two men Are even now following your steps like dogs To tear your reputation between them, And then each other for that worthless sake, And yetâ Eug. A moment, you shall see at once How easily I shall secure myself, And them, and supersede your kind intentions. Signor Don Pedro! (Calls at the window.) Clara. What are you about? Eug. Listen and you will hear. Clara. You dare not do it! Eug. My father's safely lockt up in his room, (Thanks to the gout your false alarm has brought,) My cousin gone to buy capacities, And now's my time. (Calling at the window.) Don Pedro! Signor Don Pedro! Ped. (coming below to the window). He well may wait to have his name thrice call'd When such a goddessâ Eug. Listen, sir, to me. It is because, I say, because this room, Away from father's and duenna's ears, Allows some harmless speech, it also bars All nearer access than the ears and eyes Of father or duenna both could do. But, seeing harm of harmless trifling come, I now entreat, implore, command you, sir, To leave this window and my threshold clear, Now and for ever! Ped. Hear meâ Eug. Pardon me, I cannot. Ped. But this onceâ Eug. If you persist I must be rude. Ped. Oh, how do worse thanâ Eug. (shutting the blinds down). Thus! Clara. And to your other gallant? Eug. Why not think, If he were here, I'd do the same to him? Oh, Clara, be assur'd my levities Are but the dust on youth's butterfly wing, Though prudes and sinners too take fright at them; Like that benighted traveller, you know, Who, frighted by a shallow brook that jump'd And bubbled at his right, swerv'd to the left And tumbled into one that lay quite still, But deep enough to drown him for his pains. [Exit. Clara. What, did she hear what to myself I said? Or saw my colour change from white to red? Or only guess'd me waiting for the prey Her idle chatter ought to fright away? If chance have done more than all prudence could, Prudence at least may make occasion good. And if these lovers by mistake should woo, Why (by mistake) should I not listen too? And teach the teacher, to her proper cost, Those waters are least deep that prattle most.</field>

But indeed I cannot but wonder at your sister's forwardness. Clara. Yes; to think of two cavaliers after her at once! I look upon it as my duty to set all to right; to do this I must once more speak to him who warned me of it; and I want you to give him this letterâin her name, rememberâ this will bring him here to-night, and I shall undeceive him for ever. But hark! some oneâ Torribio is about to enter. Mari. 'Tis that wretch. Stay, sir, no man comes in here. Torr. Away, troublesome duenna. Mari. It's not decent, I tell you. Torr. An't my cousin decent; and an't I? Clara. What is the matter? Torr. This old woman won't let me come in. Clara. She is right, unless my father be with you. Torr. Oh, I understandâ Those that are out Still will pout. Clara. Well, since she who is in, and may grin, is not here, you have no business neither. For me, what grudge I have against you, be assur'd I can and will repay. Mari, remember. [Exit. Mari. Hark! some one at the door. [Exit. Torr. By heav'n and earth, I do begin suspect!

Indeed, nephew, your choleric jealousy carries you too far. A respectable female in my house! Torr. I tell you that it is me whoâ Alon. I knowâenoughâmake not the matter worse by worse excuses.

My cousin, Donna Violante, inviting my daughters to witness this august ceremony! If you still suspect; here, take it, and read it for yourself. Torr. (after looking at the letter). I tell you what, uncle, if they wait till I've read it, they'll not see the sight at all. Alon. Why so? Torr. Because I can't read. Alon. That this should be! Torr. But that's no matter neither. They can teach me before they go. Alon. What, when it's to-day? almost directly? Torr. Can't it be put off? Alon. 'Tis useless saying more. Daughters, such a ceremony happens, perhaps, but once in a life; you must see it. On with your mantles, whether Don Torribio approve or not. I am lame, you see, and must keep at home; to hear about it all from you on your return. Clara. At your pleasure, sir. Eug. Shall I stay with you, sir, while Claraâ Alon. No, no. Both of you go. Clara (aside to Mari, while putting on her mantle). Remember the letter! Mari. Trust to me. Eug. (aside). I wonder if they will be there! [Exeunt all but Torribio. Torr.

Humph, what makes you out of spirits? Fel. Why should you ask? Hern. Nay, then, you have already answer'd me. You are in love. Fel. I scarce know whether you are right or wrong, Hernando. I have indeed seen a lady whose very beauty forbids all hope of my attaining it. Hern. How so, sir? Fel. She who has enslav'd Don Juan and Don Pedro has fetter'd me, at last! I should care little for their rivalry, had not each made me keeper of his love, so thatâHark! Mari NuÃ±o (within). Don Felix! Fel. Who is that? Hern. Some one calling you. Mari (within).

Why, if I speak I needs must anger you; if not, myself. Fel. I do not understand it yet. Juan. Nor I; Yet if you give me leave (as leave they give To children and to fools to say their mind) I'll say mine. Fel. Surely say it. Juan. Tell me thenâ That letter I saw flying in at the window As I came up, what was it? Fel. That of all That you could ask, Juan, I cannot answerâ Must notârelying on our old regard For fair construction. Juan.

Fel. (aside). And I, what can I do? Who, even if I may excuse myself, Must needs embroil Don Pedro! Juan. Answer me. Fel. Have I not answer'd you sufficiently, In saying that my old and well-tried love Should well excuse my silence? Juan. I confess Your love, old and well tried as you profess; And on that very score ask of you, Felix, What you would do if one as true and tried In a like case seal'd up his lips to you? Fel. Leave them unlockt in fullest confidence. Juan. Alas! how much, much easier to give Than follow ev'n the counsel one implores! Felix, in pity I entreat of you, Show me that letter! Fel. Gladly should you see it If no one but myself were implicate. Juan. There is then some one else? Fel. There is. Juan. Who else? Fel. That's what I cannot tell you. Juan. Dare not trust A friend as true to you as you to him? Fel. In anything but this. Juan. What can this do But aggravate my worst suspicions? Fel. I cannot help it. Juan. I must tell you then My friendship for you, Felix, may defer, But not forego, the reading of that letter. Fel. I am sorry, sir, your friendship must abide In ignorance till doomsday. Juan. You'll not show it? Fel. No, never. Juan. Follow me, sir. Fel. Where you please. As they are going out, enter Pedro. Ped. How now? Don Juan and Felix quarrelling? Fed. Nay, only walking out. Ped. What, walking out, With hands upon your swords and inflam'd faces? You shall not go. Hern. That's right, sir, keep them back, They were aboutâ Fel. Peace, rascal! Ped. Friends may quarrel, But surely not to such extremity But that a third may piece the quarrel up Without the sword. The cause of your dispute? Fel. I must be silent. Juan. And so must not I; Who will not have it thought That I forgot my manners as a guest For any idle reason. You, Don Pedro, Though lately known to me, are a gentleman, And you shall hear my story. Fel. Not a word, Or elseâ Ped. Nay, Felixâ Juan. I will speak it out! Don Pedro, I confided to Don Felix, My friend and host, the love I long have borne For one with whom he could advance my suit, And promis'd so to do it; but instead, Yea, under the very mask of doing it, Has urg'd his own; has even now receiv'd A letter through that ready window thrown, He dares not show me; and to make all sure, I heard him whispering as I came upstairs, The very name of my Eugeniaâ Ped. Hold! This is my quarrel. He who pretends to love Eugenia Must answer it to me. Juan. Two rivals, then! Fel. Two enemies grown out of two old friends By the very means I us'd to keep them so! Juan. Keep them, indeed! Ped. When with base treacheryâ Juan. Hypocrisyâ Ped. Under the name of friendâ Juan. A pretty friendâ Ped. You robb'd meâ Juan (turning to Pedro). You! Dare you Pretendâ Ped. (to Juan). Dare I! Dare you, sir? Fel. Peace, I say, And hear me speak! Juan (to Felix). The time is past for that. Follow me, sir. Ped. No, me. Fel. One, or the other, or together both, I'll either lead or follow, nothing loath! [Exeunt wrangling. Scene III. Alonso sitting.âEnter Torribio. Torr. Oh, uncle! Alon. Well, what now? Torr. Oh, such a thing! I suspected it! Alon. Well, tell me. Torr. Such a thing! Alon. Speak, man. Torr. When we were searching the house for the man cousin Clara told us ofâ Alon. Well? Torr. Passing by cousin Eugenia's room, I sawâI have not breath to say it! Alon. Speak, sir. Torr. Those men in the houseâthose dandies about the doorâI know how they get in nowâwhen I found in my cousin's roomâbehind her very bedâ Alon. Don Torribio! Torr. The very ladder they climb up by! Alon. A ladder? Torr. Ah, and a very strong one too, all of iron and cord. Alon. If this were trueâ Torr. Wait till I show it you, then. [Exit. Alon. Not in vain did Mari NuÃ±o warn me of her dangerous disposition! If he have such a proof of her incontinence how will he marry her? Re-enter Torribio with a fardingale. Torr. There, uncle, there it is, hoops, and steps, and all! Alon. This a ladder? Torr. Ah, that, if it were all let out, would scale the tower of Babel, I believe. Alon. I can scarce control my rage. Fool! this is a fardingale, not a ladder. Torr. A what-ingale? Alon. A fardingale, fool! âA hoop of whalebone, used to spread out the petticoat to a wide circumference;ââJohnson; who one almost wonders did not spread out into a wider circumference of definition about the âpoore verdingales,â that (according to Heywood) ? âmust lie in the streete, To have them no doore in the citye made meete.â The Spanish name is âguarda infanta,â which puzzles Don Torribio, as to what his cousin had to do with infants. Our word was first (as Heywood writes) verdingale: which, as Johnson tells us, âmuch exercised the etymology of Skinner, who at last seems to determine that it is derived from vertu garde.â This, however, Johnson thinks does not at all get to the bottom of the etymology, which may, he says, be found in Dutch. Perhaps the old French petenlair was of the same kindred. Torr. Why, that's worse than the ladder! Alon. You will fairly drive me out of my senses! Go, sir, directly, and put it back where you took it from, and for Heaven's sake, no more of such folly! [Exit. Torr. Wellâto think of this! and my cousin that look'd so nice too! Voices (within). Coach there! coach! Enter Mari NuÃ±o. Mari. They are come back. I must get lights. Who's this? Torr. Nobody. Mari. What are you doing with that fardingale; and where did you get it? Torr. Nothing, and nowhere. Mari. Come, give it me at once, lest I give you the fellow of the cuff I gave you before. Torr. For fear of which, take that upon your wrinkled chaps. (Strikes her, and calls out.) Help! help! Murder! murder! Help! Enter Alonso, Clara, Eugenia, &amp;c. in mantles. Alon. What now? Torr. Mari NuÃ±o there, only because I wish'd her good night, laid violent hands on me. Mari. Oh the wretch! he wanted to make love to meâ and worseâdeclaring he would none of any who used such a thing as this. (Showing fardingale.) Alon. Let us hear no more of such folly. There is something else to-day to tell of. Well, (to his daughters,) you have seen this procession? Eug. Ay, sir; the greatest sight, I believe, that Spain has seen since she was greatest of nations. Alon. I, who could not go myself, am to see it, you know, in your recital. Eug. As best we can, sir. Clara (aside to Mari NuÃ±o). Have you seen Don Felix? Mari (aside). Enough, he will be here. But when? Clara. When the story is done, and all weary are gone to bed. Mari. Good. [Exit; the rest sit down. Clara. Begin you then, Eugenia, I will chime in. Eug. This being the long-expected day When our fair Spain and fairest Mariana Should quicken longing hope to perfect joy, Madrid awoke, and dress'd her squares and streets In all their glory; through all which we pass'd Up to the Prado, where the city's self, In white and pearl array'd, by ancient usage, Waited in person to receive the bride By a triumphal arch that rose heaven-high, The first of four all nam'd and hung about With emblems of the four parts of the world, (Each with a separate element distinct,) Of which our sovereign lord was now to lay The four crowns at his sovereign lady's feet. Clara. And this first arch was Europe; typified By the wide Air, which temperatest she breathes, And which again, for double cognizance, Wore the imperial eagle for its crest; With many another airy symbol more, And living statues supplementary Of Leon and Castile, each with its crown, Austria, the cradle of the royal bride, And Rome, the mistress of the faith of all. Eug. Here then, when done the customary rite Of kissing hands and due obeisance, Drum, trumpet, and artillery thundering, With that yet lordliest salute of all, A people's universal acclamation; (And never in the world were subjects yet So proud, and bow'd, and with so good a cause;) Under a golden canopy she mov'd Tow'rd San Geronimo, whose second arch, Of no less altitude and magnificence, Deckt with the sixty crowns of Asia, Receiv'd her next, wearing for cognizance Earth, of which Asia is the largest piece; Which Earth again carried a lion's mane, As proclamation of her noblest growth. Clara. Thence passing on, came to where Africa, Her waste of arid desert embleming By Fire, whose incarnation, the Sun, Burn'd on this arch as in his house in heaven, Bore record of the trophies two great Queens Upon the torrid continent had won, Who, one with holy policy at home, The other in Granada by the sword, Extirpated deadly Mahometism. Eug. Last, to the Holy Virgin dedicate, From whose cathedral by the holy choir Chaunted Te Deum, rose in splendid arch America, wearing for her device The silver image of the Ocean, That roll'd the holy cross to the New World. And so all pass'd to the Escurial, In front of which, in two triumphal cars, Two living statues wereâone Mercury, Who, as divine ambassador, thus far Had brought the royal bride propitiously; The other, Hymen, who took up the charge Mercury left, and with unquenching torch, While cannon, trumpet, choir, and people's voice Thunder'd her praises, took the palfrey's rein, Who gloried in the beauty that he bore, And brought and left her at her palace door. Alon. Well done, well done, both of you, in whose lively antiphony I have seen it all as well as if I had been there. Torr. Well, for my part I neither wanted to see it nor hear of it. Alon. No? why so, nephew? Torr. Lord, I've seen twice as good as that down in my country many a time, all the boys and girls dancing, and the mayor, and the priest, andâ Alon. Peace, peace. Come, Brigida, light me to my room, I am sleepy. Eug. And I; with sight-seeing, and sight-telling, I suppose. (Aside.) And with a heavy heart, alas! [Exeunt Alonso, Eugenia, and Brigida. Clara. Will not you to bed too, sir? Torr. Not till I've had my supper, I promise you. Oh, I don't care for all your sour looks, not I, nor your threats of revenge neither. Clara. You don't? Torr. No, I defy you. Clara. Not if I were to prove to you that she you slighted me for loves another? Torr. Oh, cousin Clara! Clara. Shall I prove it to you? Torr. Oh, if my ancestors could hear this, what would they say? Clara. I don't know. But you may hear if you like what she says to your rival. Torr. Ha! Clara. Go into this balcony, and you will hear her talking to him in the street. Torr. I knew! I guess'd! the ladder! (He goes into the balcony and she shuts him in.) Clara. There cool yourself in the night till I let you out. And now to have you safe too. (Locks Eugenia's door.) And now, all safe, for the first time in my life Love and I meet in fair field. Mari NuÃ±o! (Enter Mari.) Where is the Cavalier? Mari. Waiting in my chamber. Clara. Bring him. You understand it is all for Eugenia's good? Mari. I understand. [Exit, and returns with Felix. Fel. I fly, madam, to your feet. (Kneels.) Clara. Rise, sir, 'tis about your letter I sent to you. Fel. Alas, madam, all is worse than ever! Clara. What has happened? Fel. Not only did my two friends fall out with each other, as I expected, but with me for the very good services I was doing them; insulted me till I could withhold my sword no longer; we went out to fight; were seen, pursued, and disperst by the alguazils. I return'd home to await them, but as yet know nothing more of them. Clara. Alas, sir, what do I not owe you for your care on my behalf? Fel. More perhaps than you imagine. Clara. Tell me all at least, that I may at least know my debt, if unable to repay it. Fel. Alas, I dare not say what is said in not saying. Clara. Said, and not said? I do not understand. Fel. I, alas, too well! Clara. Explain to me then, sir. Fel. No, madam. If what I feel is so much on my friends' account, it is still more for their sakes that I keep it unsaid. Clara. Hark! what noise is that? Mari NuÃ±o, what is the matter? Enter Mari NuÃ±o. Mari. Oh, madam, some one is getting over the garden wall! Your father has heard the noise; and is got up with his sword. Clara. If he should find you! Fel. He need not. This balconyâ Clara. No, no! Torribio (within). Thieves! Murder! Help! (He opens the balcony; Torribio falls forward on him, push'd in by Juan with his sword drawn.) All at once. Torr. Murder! Murder! Juan (to Felix). Thou too here, traitor! Fel. (drawing his sword). Who are these? (Confusion, in which enter Alonso with drawn sword, OtaÃ±ez, Brigida, &amp;c.) Alon. Two! Torribio, to my side! Fel. Wait! wait! Let me explain. Alon. Don Felix! Fel. Listen to me, all of you, I say! I was sent for to prevent, not to do, mischief, by Donna Eugenia herselfâ Enter Eugenia. Eug. By me, sir! Clara. Hold, hold, Eugenia! Eug. I will not hold when my name is in question without myâSent for by me, sir! Fel. Not by you, madam; by Donna Eugenia, (pointing to Clara,) to preventâ Alon. and Eug. Clara! Torr. Ah, 'twas she put me to freeze in the balcony, too. Clara (to Felix). Sir, you come here to save another from peril. Leave me not in it. Fel. I leave you, madam, who would lay down my life for you! and all the rather if you are not Donna Eugenia. Alon. None but her father or her husband must do that. Fel. Then let me claim to do it as the latter. (Kneels to Clara.) Alon. But Clara? Clara. Sir, I am ready to obey my fatherâand my husband. Eug. And I, sir. And to prove my duty, let me marry my cousin at once, and retire with him to the mountains. Torr. Marry me! No, indeed! No Capacities, and ladders, andâwhat-d'ye-call-'emsâfor me. I'll e'en go back as I came, with my ancestors safe in my saddle-bags, I will. Juan (to Alonso). Permit me, sir. I am Don Juan de Mendoza; a name at least not unknown to you. I have loved your daughter long; and might have had perchance fovourable acceptation from her mother long ago, had not you yourself been abroad at the time. Alon. I now remember to have heard something of the kind. What say you, Eugenia? Eug. I am ready to obey my fatherâand my husband.

This marriage was in 1649; when Calderon, as old as the century, was in his prime; and I think the airy lightness of the dialogue, the play of character, the easy intrigue, and the happily introduced wedding rhapsodies, make it one of the most agreeable of his comedies. As I purposely reduced the swell of Isabel's speech in the last play, I must confess that the present version of these wedding pageants, though not unauthorized by the original, had perhaps better have been taken in a lighter tone to chime in with so much common dialogue. But they were done first, to see what could be made of them: and, as little dramatic interest is concerned, are left as they were; at least not the less like so much in Calderon, where love and loyalty are concerned; and to be excused by the reader as speeches spouted by boys on holiday occasions. THE END.</field>
