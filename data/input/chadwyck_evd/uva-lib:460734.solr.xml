      <field name="fulltext">TERESA A TRAGEDY IN ONE ACT</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO MY CHILDREN</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scene: A Vaulted Chamber in an Italian Castle. Bare stone walls hung with antique arms. In the back wall an arched doorway, showing passage beyond when the tapestry curtain is withdrawn. In the right wall a large open, fireplace, and in a line with it, near the front of the stage, another arch, also curtained, leading through a passage into the Chapel. In the left wall a window with deep embrasure. An old table near the fireplace: two high-backed chairs in front of it, and several others against the walls.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Time: Thirteenth Century. Afternoon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS. Count Alberto, the young Lord of the Castle. Luigi, his half-brother. The Castellan. Teresa, his blind daughter. Bianca, Alberto's bride. A Priest. The Steward of the Household. Envoy from Count Carlo, Bianca's guardian. Officer and soldiers of Count Carlo. Singing-boys, page, men-at-arms. Other members of the household, men and women.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[On the rising of the curtain two men-at-arms are discovered, keeping guard on each side of door B. 1st. I like not this office. Hast any liquor about thee? 2nd. Nay, I have not moistened these two hours. I keep my pipkin dry for supper. There will be old wassail to-night. 1st. I doubt I cannot last till then. My gullet is cracking like a lizard's back. How many hours ere nightfall? 2nd. Not so many to thee as to our master, the Count. With him, I warrant, 'tis the longest day. 1st. Love was ever a midsummer madness: but, is the Lady Bianca so fair as 'tis said? 2nd. She had need be, and rich to boot, to weigh against the crowns that will be cracked for her. 1st. What, think you Count Carlo will up falcon, and fly after? 2nd. Why, man, he was to wed her, willy nilly, and her lands beside. 1st. Marry! Cannot a man wed a lass of his own folk, without filching from his neighbour? An' I couldn't compass a wife fair and peaceable, I'd as lief let her be. 2nd. It's the blood, man, the blood that does it. There's no more likelihood between his blood and thine, than between good drink and standing water. Great folks be so swelled out wi' what belongs to 'em, that they fall to hankering after what don't: and the more it don't belong, the more they hanker. 1st. There's Mistress Teresa, the Castellan's lass; ain't she tall enow and comely? 2nd. Ay, but blind, man, blind. There's no cowing of 'em, when they can't look you in the face. In words, mark you, they have the upper tongue of us. You can't tame 'em else. It's the eye that does it. 1st. Well, there'll be knocks anon. I care little, so they set not me to keep the door. [During this conversation the men-at-arms have left their posts, and gradually advanced towards the front of the stage. Enter Steward of the Household. Steward. Now, you scurvy knaves, what were my orders? Stand to your posts. The bride is coming. [They fly back to their posts. So, stand there till the procession is past. Then close up, fall in five paces to the rear, and follow. [Exit B. 1st. I'm all of a quake. There's a kind of backbiting here betwixt my shoulders. Prithee, chafe me with thy halberd. 2nd. Prate not; they are coming. [Trumpets. [Enter B, the bridal procession. First, Steward with wand, then singing-Boys, a Priest robed, Page carrying helmet and gauntlets, Alberto and Bianca, as affianced Bride and Bridegroom, Soldiers, Men and Women of the household, last, the Castellan, leading his blind Daughter. The latter totters, quits her father's hand, and sinks into a seat. The rest, followed by the two men-at-arms, pass out at door R. Castellan. Teresa, child, what ails thee? Teresa. I am sick, And can proceed no further. Let me be. Go thou and join the pageant. Castellan. Nay, nay, nay, This must be looked to. Thou art more to me Than all the pomps of pope and cardinal. Without thee, dear, the wedding-mirth is marred, The garlands withered, and the lights put out. Can'st thou not cheer a little? Teresa. Father, father, It is the mirth that maddens. What have I To do with bridal feasts and merrimentâ All the delights that I shall never know?â A living corse, condemned by God to grope In its own grave, dead without death's repose. Castellan. If death's dull handiwork can look like thee, We'll have no burials, or inter the quick. A living corse! Thou art more beautiful Than any bride that e'er these eyes beheld, Exceptâexcept thy mother. Teresa. Tell me, father, Was she like me, so proud and passionate, Quick to spurn insult and to plot revenge? Had she all Etna boiling in her veins, And spurting out in fire? or was she staid, Sober and self-contained, meek and demure, And cold as yonder northern icicle? (Hoarsely in his ear) Would she have killed you had you loved her not? Castellan. That would have killed me, to have loved her not. O child! you fright me: this pent heat of heart Springs not from her, or springs without the poise Of that which tempered passion, the calm sway Of a pure spirit that half lived in heaven. Teresa. Alas! alas! I am unworthy her, Unworthy thee. My mind is on the earth, And earth's a hell: I cannot think of heaven. Castellan. You must not, must not say it. Sometimes we lie Deep in the sea's dark hollow, but anon, Washed upward on its glittering back, we mount Into the sunlight. Such a wave, perchance, Of happiness awaits thee. Teresa. Such a wave Of sorrow has engulfed me. Castellan. I have that Within my mind, Teresa, which I fear Almost to tell thee, and yet speak I must. Teresa. I can bear anything that thou would'st say. Castellan. The Count Luigi is a noble knight; And I do think he loves thee. Were it so, And so it is, say, would'st thou marry him? Teresa. Marry an asp, a viper, a vile toad Tricked by some witch-wife, for despite of man, Into the shape of manhood! Castellan. There it is! I do but bruise thee with my blundering wit. Go to! when blacksmiths can shoe butterflies, Then shall I cope with maidens in their moods. Teresa. Nay, but first learn to read the moods of men. Castellan. To me he seemed a loyal gentleman: And, sure, he doats upon thee. Teresa. I perceive, Father, I must e'en tell thee all my tale. Say, wilt thou heed it? Castellan. Ay. Teresa. Rememberest thou, When first the plague of blindness smote our vale, How Count Alberto, then a child, and I Groped in the dark together? Oh, 'tis strange How one great misery, falling upon twain, So singling them, can sort the odds of birth Or inward difference, and make yoke-fellows Whom Nature else had strangered! Well, we roamed Our little world together, and explored A thousand nooks and crannies of the rocks, And winding secrets of the vaulted gloom Beneath the Castle-bases, till we learnt To dare with eyeless footsteps what with eyes Had scared us; so that one sense lost became, By quickening of the rest, a new sense found. Then came the wise physician, who had skill To ope the filmÃ¨d orbs, let in the light; And so we saw, yet saw not, being bound Fast with closed eyelids for some certain days, Lest seeing should unsight us. Castellan. Well do I Remember, and our hope, and then the grief, The bitter grief, when in the curtained room Your eyes were opened, and you saw me not, And the glad triumph of his eyes, that saw. Teresa. And so I lost my playmate; but the cause None ever knew; and I will tell thee. When The doctor left us we were set to sleep In the same chamber; but no sleep had I, Doubting and wondering, could I really see. Methought the hours would stretch them into days, The days seem years, ere I could solve my doubt. So I lay tossing. 'Twas a fearful nightâ I hear it nowâthe dykes of heaven were burst, And the pent floods, a solid water-wall, Drove up against the tower: all winds at once Made rummage in the sky, whose huge dome shook, Split like a potsherd, and came shattering down In thunder. Then a sudden thought was bornâ The lightning! I shall know if I can see, See him! In a moment I had stole from bed, And was beside him, with the band torn off, That held my sight, almost my soul, within it. I stood beneath the window; a flash came, A quick, fierce spasm, convulsing heaven and meâ No fork, but blackness spattered o'er with fire. O father, in that instant I beheld, Beheld him, as he slumbered. A wild pang Shot through both eyeballs, but his face was there, Burnt in upon my brain. Then all was dark. Long, long I waited: still the thunder rolled, Ay, still the thunder, but no lightning more, No lightning, nor no light; the face alone! And from that momentâfrom that momentâ Castellan. Ah! What from that moment? nay, fear not to say it. Teresa. Methinks, methinks I have beenâblind. Castellan. And I Blinder. God send thee patience! Teresa. Not unless He would unmake His handiwork. My blood Is mixed with patience, as the fire with snow. When men from flint strike water, or babes suck Vesuvius' boiling bosom, when the sea Lies flat beneath Sirocco, then will I, Teresa, cower before the blasts of fate, And curb me to quiescence. Let them blow! My depths shall heave in answer. I have that Seething within me which no heart could hold, Such passion as would toss above the clouds And crunch a thousand of such petty craft As dare to override me. By the doom Of that dread hour I claim him, by the bond Writ red in lightning letters, and sealed fast With pitch-black darkness!âPatience, father! no; That is not in me, but revenge, or death! [Trumpets. Castellan. Hush, hush! allay your ecstasy: they come! This is mere madness. O my child! my child! [Re-enter R the bridal procession, as before. The Boys, as they pass the door, begin singing. Bring every dainty disk and bell, That are the eyes of May, Her beauty and her fame to swell, Who is more fair than they. From opening-hour to shut of flower Love lead her all the way! Hang up the bow, put by the spear, And crown with dance the day, While every nymph of moat or mere Doth curtsey to our fay: Come, lover bold, come, maiden cold, And lift the bridal lay! Oh, blessed is the bridal bower, Where love alone hath sway! His sceptre to the weak is power, His staff the mourners' stay: All else must end 'twixt friend and friend, But love endures for aye. Now, squire and damsel, lass and lad, For these fair lovers pray; And of their gladness be ye glad, And shout aloud, and say, âDeign, noble knight, and lady bright, To list our roundelay.â Luigi. Live, Count Alberto and his lovely bride! Friends, give them welcome with your voices! Now! [They all shout. My noble kinsman, let that shout attestâ More eloquent than more preparÃ¨d speech, That oft, like honey from a hollow trunk Drips sweetness, when the heart is false withinâ What love we bear you, and how every pulse, Tuned to one note, as in one bosom beats. We have been bred together, and sometimes, It may be, a chance word, or a chance blow, Put wrath betwixt us: we were men, not girls, Now pecked like falcons, and now cooed like doves. I have no skill, if aught be done amiss, To salve the sore with words, nor will attempt it. Rather let this poor gift my pleader be, This sword, an emblem not of war, but peace. The blade is past unkindness, which do thou Bury in its fair sheath, forgetfulness. If 'tis accepted, as 'tis offered, thus, Then shall I know myself forgiven. [Alberto takes the sword. Wine ho! And let us drink together. [A Page brings wine. Alberto. Brother, thanks! Thus wash we down all bitterness! I take This blade of battle with the like goodwill That prompted to the giving. And, friends all, Believe I love you, though my words be few. I am tongue-tied to-day. My heart swells o'er, And cannot hold the too much happiness. For Nature knows no measure in her gifts, Or scants, or scatters bounty, drought or flood; Nor can the soul build reservoirs, wherein What's waste and over may be husbanded. So now my bliss chokes utterance, and half drowns What it should quicken. May the sweet excess Flow over upon you. I thank you all. To-night we will hold wassail, and, till then Speed on the empty hours with dance and song. [They all shout again. Teresa seizes a harp from the wall, with wild gesture, and sings. Teresa. O blushing bride and gallant groom, Hark hither, while ye may! A spectre rises from the gloom, To mock your mirth and play. With grief and fear the boding hear, And when ye hear, obey! Break up the feast, crush flower and crown, Bid mask and revel stay! Bold warrior, fling the wine-cup down, Fair lady, turn to pray! 'Mid shriek and shout the lights go out, And darkness ends the day. Soft eyes may burn, hot lips may kiss, And fool the hours away; But there's a fire that is not bliss, And it endures for aye. 'Twixt bridal bell and funeral knell, What boots it to be gay? Ay, feast and frolic as ye will; Ere many an eve be grey All mirth, all measures must be still, And in the cold dank clay, Wrapped head to feet in winding-sheet, King Death alone have sway. [She rises, flings down the harp, totters, and sinks senseless into her father's arms. General consternation and uproar. Alberto. This from Teresa! Luigi. I had ne'er believed it. Voices. Away with her! She's mad. A witch! A witch! Castellan. Friends, I beseech you patience. Let her be. I am quite sure that no unholy spell, Or evil sprite, hath power upon my child. 'Tis but a passing passion, that at times, Bred of dull musing and mere loneliness, Brews like a storm within the heart, then breaks, And all is clear again. It is the sound Of mirth and happiness, she may not see, So shakes her from herself. Pray, think of her As of a bird, that, flying out of night To the warm brightness of some festal hall, Strikes the barred window, and falls hurt. Priest. Methinks There is more in it. Either she hath held Communion with forbidden arts, that are Familiar to the darkness, that she dares Pry into fate, and wag a wanton tongue, Blighting with curses what the Church hath blest, Or else some demon hathâwhich God forbid!â Made his foul home in her fair form, and must Be exorcised and ousted. In the name Of God, I charge theeâ Castellan. And I charge thee, keep The holy charm for them that need it, lest Nor scalp nor scapular protect thee. [A trumpet is heard. Luigi. Hark! I hear a trumpet! Has the curse come true? Alberto. Hie thee, Luigi, to the tower, and see Who blows so loud a summons, friend or foe, And, so that he come single, friend or foe, Let him have entrance, and conduct him hither. [Exit Luigi, B. [A buzz of talk, then a pause, all eyes turned toward the door. Enter Luigi, leading Envoy from Count Carlo. Luigi. A foe, my lord, but on such errand sent As we perforce must countenance his suit, Craves audience from Count Carlo. Alberto. Welcome, sir. Your trumpet sounded no uncertain note: Be the word spoken as concise and clear. Envoy. It shall, my lord. My master bids me ask Why, like a ruffian-thief, with force and guile, You have seduced from lawful custody His ward, the fair Biancaâa foul scorn Both to himself, and his affianced bride, That cries aloud for vengeance. And unless You shall make restitution here and now, And, in my escort, send the lady home, This very hour he'll thunder at your gate, Break down the wall, o'erturn the battlements, And leave you dangling from your tallest tower. [Murmurs of indignation, amidst which Teresa (aside). 'Mid shriek and shout the lights go out, And darkness ends the day. Alberto. A most clear message, and my answer this: Say that you found us in fair bridal gear, But at a word our armour shall be on, Our bows strung ready, and our hearts as light As the vain breath of his most idle boast. We bore our lady with her sweet consent From where a treacherous villain and a churl Held her imprisoned, and with coward threats Sought by main force to wed. His caitiff blood Is all unworthy of my knightly sword, But if he durst confront it, let him come. And so farewell! Some of you, lead him safe Beyond the barbican. [Exit Envoy with guard. Alack! dear friends, We must defer our mirth. Castellan, see The swords be keen, the arrows winged and trim, And all our war-gear ready: then at once Up with the drawbridge, man the walls, and so Bid we fair welcome to our vaunting foe! [Exit with Bianca. [Castellan leads Teresa to a seat, where she remains. All the rest hurry from the chamber. Teresa. When all the earth is full of stir, to lack What makes the meanest creature serviceable! Enter Luigi, B When all the vault is full of burning eyes, To be a dull dead orb, that cannot shine, Quenched and forgotten in the firmament! Luigi. Not quenched, and not forgotten; yet there lives, Whose bark were lost, but for thy saving ray; By Heaven! who holds thee for the brightest star That ever swum the welkin! Teresa. Stop; no more! The love whereto your tongue importunes meâ No need of eyes for blackness to be seenâ Sorts not with honour; and I spit upon it. You have oft dared it; let me tell you, then, For the last time, wild beasts are for the woods, Not ladies' bowers. We are of gentle birth, Our blood more wine than water: and I bear That in my bosom which can ward off shame. [Handling a dagger. Luigi. He were thrice knave, and ten times o'er a fool, Who, knowing you, should need it. Your scorn cuts Deeper than any dagger. Teresa. To what end So thriftless of your breath then? Luigi. How if love Had from a beast transformed me to a man? Teresa. A man, with eyes, were face to face with men At such an hour, not paltering with a girl. Luigi. A man, with eyes to read a woman's heart, As I read yoursâ Teresa. As you read mine! ah ha! What read you there? Luigi. Love, jealousy, and hate. Teresa. I have heard say that love is born of sight; And, without love, no jealousy. But hateâ Hate is the child of darkness: I can hate. Luigi. Well then, how hate you your new mistress? Teresa. How? As the bare foot the hidden flint, as fire The wave that's dashed upon't, as dying beasts The vulture, asâ Luigi. Nay, hearken then to me. I too have cause to hate her, for she stands Betwixt me and my hope. Teresa. What hope is that? Luigi. To be the lord of these fair lands and thee, When a chance blow in some wild border war Has robbed me of his Countship. Nay, you know He is my brother by the half-blood only: I am the elder, but the bastard's ban Rests on my birth. Were that not hard enough, Once in a moment of wild anger he Put that vile name upon me, half a score Of grooms and lackeys listening, and with scoffs Drave me from door. Therefore I love him not. Teresa. And to this âlove him notâ what sequel, say; My aid, belike, to deal him a chance blow, As you so delicately frame the phrase? Luigi. Men, who make booty of betrothÃ¨d brides, Fall ere they ripen, in rough times like these: But let him live, so he live single. Teresa. Ha! What hell-snake wreathes his coils about my heart? Is villainy so catching? Luigi. Marked you not, With what a glance she eyed you? Teresa. You forget I see no glances, but, O God! I feel them. Luigi. And heard you not, âAlberto, who is that Proud vassal, whom you smile on, she who blights Our bridal with a frown, like frost in May?â And then his answer, âShe is blind and poor; Sweet, set it down to her infirmity: You have no rival. I am only thine?â Teresa. Can souls, that swim in fire, so thirst for more? Then welcome hell hereafter! Luigi. Think of it. To be in bondage to the thing you hate! How, on the rack of injured pride, one hour Is, with the sufferer, stretched to thrice its bulk! And then to linger out days, months, and years In hearing of her praises, while she twines Close and yet closer round his fostering stem, Incorporate, grown indissolubly one, And bears him goodly clusters! you the while Outsplendouring her beauties, as the dark Yet fiery mantle of a stormy sun The pale-rimmed ocean ere he rose. Teresa. I knew it! I knew the colour from her voice and touch. God! how I hate their happiness! Luigi. Dare then To thwart it, and divorce them. I have means Of secret access to Count Carlo. He, Though confident of conquest, fears some slip Of fortune, lest the prey, within his grasp, Thrid some dark outlet, or amid the crash Of falling towers escape him. Teresa. Hie thee back, Bid him await her, and set men to watch All day till sunset by the fallen oak, That hides the entrance of a low-browed cave Beneath the western tower. She shall be there, I leading by a subterranean way Known to none else. For I can shape it so, Persuading her to safety. If to-night She come not, then to-morrow, or whene'er Terror or treachery drives her from the hold. Luigi. O glorious woman! were one word unsaid, I could set foot on fate, bestride the clouds, Storm heaven! We must about it, I and thou; Be those three words my motto, âI and thou!â No tenderer thought possess thee till 'tis done, And I returnâ Teresa. Return no more! If God Have any vaster gulf than hell and heaven, Further than east from west, or north from south, Two points so hugely sundered as scarce leaves An inch of distance between pole and pole, I pray Him of His bounty place us there, Housed each in one, for time so long as makes Eternity a moment, and to weld, Wherefrom His fiercest thunderbolts are wrought, Through point and point a sacramental ring, Our troth-plight of abhorrence! Thus will I Wed thee. And now begone! Yet, ere thou go, First be one lie unspoken: for behold! As fire bursts upward, breaks the mountain's heart, That bred, but cannot hold it, and anon Spills over in destruction, so this deed Is measure of the might wherewith I love, Love, love him, as I loathe myself and thee. [Sinks into a seat. Luigi. Loving or loathing, she shall yet be mine. [Exit, R. Enter B, Bianca. Bianca. Our poor blind maiden here, and all alone? Nay, do not stir; the terror is so great, That by your leave I'll bear you company. Teresa. Madam, you may command. I pray you sit. Bianca. Nay, but we'll sit together. How brave you are! I see it in your faceâa troubled face, Albeit so beautiful: a while ago, Indeed, I almost feared it, feared some wrong Had reft you of the sweetness that must dwell Within the heart that owns so fair a face, And left you seared and smarting. Is it so? Teresa. O madam! you are kindâI know not wellâ Something there is that visits me at times, A gloom, not of the body, that hath power To make me what you saw: regard it not. Bianca. What is your name? Teresa. Teresa. Bianca. A sweet name: My husband told me, I remember now, And said how you and heâwhy do you start?â Were blind together. You would blush to know How much he praised you: happily for me I am not jealous. Teresa. He is very good: I do not well deserve it. What was that? Hark! Bianca. I heard nothing more than the dull thud Of the ram battering at the wall, and that Less loud than my own heart against my ribs. Is it so very dreadful to be blind? I shut my eyes, and try to picture it, But cannot. Teresa. None so blind as they that see. Bianca. That is all one as if you said outright I am the blinder. Teresa. Madam, there is that, Which too much seeing will not let you see. Sight, like a silk-rigged vessel of the mind, Skims but life's surface; if it burn or break, The thought sinks deeper. Bianca. Ah! I dread the depth, And would float ever with the stars to guide. Who knows, alas! what shadowy monster-shapes Loom into being as you dive below? Teresa. All happy souls are cowards, and fear change. Bianca. Then not to be so happy may be best. Teresa. That is a comfort which is sure to come. Bianca. You speak too sadly; for methinks that God Had never made us what we are, the world So full of tender uses, to break up Our brooding solitude, nor hung from heaven So many a curtain to shut out despair, Were we not meant to move toward happiness. Teresa. Out of the heart's abundance the mouth speaks: My heart is empty, therefore I speak not. Bianca. See now, my talk offends you; but 'tis best, At such an hour, whate'er the theme, to stir Dull musing with some ripple of discourse. I seem to have known you, oh, so long, so long! Teresa. And I myself ne'er to have known myself. Terrible! terrible! Bianca. There, take my hand; 'Twill comfort both of us: the strength of two Is more, methinks, than twice the strength of one. Teresa. I cannot do it: mine is a raging fire: One touch of it would burn you to the bone. Bianca. Dear child, I care not: 'tis the best of grief That in its bitter bulk a loadstone lies, To draw sad hearts together. Teresa (aside). Would that I Were deaf as blind, since hearing strikes me dumb! Bianca. See! we are almost strangers, and yet I Love you, Teresa; and will you not, too, Love me a little for my dear lord's sake? Teresa. Did you sayâlove meâfor my dear lord's sake? O God! my wits are reeling! let me rise And pace the room awhile. Bianca. Try to be calm; And let us wait the issue. I have known Worse hours than this, that, like a feverish night, Passed, and 'twas sunny morning. That was when Yon tiger-Count, now ramping at the gate, Had me in clutchâthe man that knew not love, Yet would have wed me. Then my hero shone, And wrought deliverance. I could laugh at death If he came now. To love and to be lovedâ What need we more? that is the perfect sum. Teresa. Death, yes: but thraldom, how if that ensue, To mar your sum's perfection? My lord Death Comes late or early, ne'er in nick of time. Bianca. Thraldom! to whom? Teresa, if you thinkâ I would live onâah! then, you have not loved. Why, girl, a prick, a leap, a plunge would do it. I hold it were no sin to save from shame. Teresa. Methinks the noise comes nearer. Enter a Soldier. Bianca. Now, what news? Soldier. My lord commends him to his noble wife. Bianca. Say, is he well?âWhat fortune?âfind thy tongue! Soldier. The wall was breached, and they had thrice poured in, And thrice their back-flung bodies dammed the moat, When Count Luigiâne'er had I believed it, Had not mine own eyes seen himâslips aside, Unbolts the postern, and lets in the flood, That washed us, flank and rear, with bloody wavesâ Teresa. O noble brother!â Soldier. And beat us from the wall, That many fell. He bids you have good hope, For God fights with him: every sword-swing cleaves Some breast or basnet, and his war-axe, whirled, Mows like the scythe in summer. Fare you well. Bianca. Say that, whate'er the issue, I am his, And know not fear. Back to his side, and fight! [Exit Soldier. Out on these tidings! How my heart belies The courage of my tongue! Teresa. Lady, I fear The best of life is over. Say that I Could in a minute, by some secret way, Such as the blind may thrid, through dripping vaults Beneath the lowest dungeons, and by stairs Of slippery rock, that know no foot but mine, Now lead you safe to the grey convent walls That crown the mere's steep edgesâwould you come? Bianca. My answer?ânay, you know it. The hounds of hell, With Carlo mounted on Death's carrion flanks Behind them, and Luigi's hunting-cry, Choked with the sulphurous breath from whence he came, Should never stir nor scare me, while he lives. But, O Teresa! if indeed you know Of such a haven, and have learnt the way To find it, and dare tread it all alone, Now, while the doors are fast, the strong walls stand, And no red fire-tongues leap from floor to floor, Leave me, my sister: you are young, and free, And beautiful; and surely some brave arms Wait to enfold you, and on your sweet breast Some heart to find its heaven. Teresa. O God! O God! Bianca. Hark! I hear hurrying steps! 'tis he, 'tis he! [Enter Alberto, B. The noise outside increases. Alberto. Bianca, my Bianca, one last kiss, And thenâand thenâ Bianca. Hush! hush! you shall not say it. Alberto. Love, all is lost. Teresa, my poor child, Your father'sâslain. Teresa (wildly). I knew it. 'Tis well, 'tis well. I saw him hurl into the foemen's ranks, And leap on damned Luigi. A good end! Bianca. She is half mad with sorrow: mark her not. Alberto. No man died better; I can tell you that; But all fought nobly, and the day seemed won, When, by a treacherous hand the gate thrown wide, Outwitted and outnumbered, fast we fell. So sick of slaughter, where no hope appeared, Still fighting backward, till the door was gained, I bade the remnant for dear life give o'er, And seek a happier master. It is done. I am the last man left alive and free. Bianca. And now? Alberto. Our halls are empty, but you hear The guest knock loud for entrance; and anon The host will open, and to no mean fare Of iron entertainment, if God will, Give him such welcome as may pierce his heart. O my white wonder, is it come to this?â A few short minutesâ Bianca. And we die together. Seems it so bitter hard? Alberto. It cannot be. Bianca. That is the first harsh word that you have spoke In all our wedded lifeâone dear long day. Alberto. Think it unspoken then. Forgive me, sweet, But love like ours can say to Time, âStop hereâ: So will you live, live always in this hour, No past, no future: you will feel and know My arms wound close about you, and amid The aching silence hear each accent still. Look, what the heart speaks, that alone is true: Death is a liar: you can laugh at lies. Bianca. Yea, were time longer, I would laugh at yours. Love, 'tis a lie to say it cannot be: See how I cling! one sword shall end us both. Alberto. Nay, you say nothing, sweet. Why, who would strike A lily-flower, a snow-flake? Bianca. I know who. There is a man, or else a woman, shall. Give me this dagger, if you fear to do it. [He holds her hand. Fie on your love then; would you let me drop Back into hell, that am halfway to heaven? I live to beâI cannot name the thingâ The minion of a miscreant! Alberto. Nay, but hear How I shall save you both from death and hell. Yon heart of oak, time-tough, and ribbed with iron, Will blunt them many an axe, bend many a bar. Ay, and they know it, for the knaves e'en now Hew faggots, and bring fire-brands, and full soon The valves will blacken, and the ribs glow red, And the beams burst; for what can fight with fire? Bianca. So your white maid, that was, becomes a heap Of whiter ashes: nay, if die I must, Quicker and colder is the death for me. Alberto. All through the battle he has shunned my sight; But when the doors go down, and the smoke clears, Backed by some fifty, he perchance will dare it. He has met fortune, and with traitors dealt: There shall I meet him: he must deal with me. Now hark, Teresa: to your faithful charge I yield your mistress. There is store of food, Water to drink, and covering from the cold: Take them, and lead her to the secret cell In the thick dungeon-wall, below the crypt. You know the mystery of the door: no fire Could ever reach it, and no foe surprise. So one more kiss, and then good nightâgood night! [She sinks clinging to his knees. Teresa. Men are brave lovers for an hour or twain, And some few faithful, if the wind hold fair: But when it comes to thisâquick easy death, And glory with it, or life's dull decay, Marry! to perish is man's privilege; But for the womanâoh, 'tis good enough To wear black weeds, and waste in solitude, Stretched, a pale martyr, on Time's torturing cross, That pride, called courage, doomed her to endure. Bianca. Alberto, she but speaks the bitter truth: I do not leave you, or you leave not me. [She rises and clings closer. Teresa (Aside). Dare I to do it? yes, I dare and must. I lived not till this moment: they are mine. (Aloud) My lord, do you remember, years ago, Ere darkness fell upon us, how we strayed, Child-playmates, by the margin of the mere, And came to a low cave, and hand in hand Entered, and feared the blackness? Alberto. Ay, right well. Teresa. 'Twas fringed with daisies at the mouth, whereof You wove a wreath to crown me; and we knelt Together on the turf, and feigned to wed. Then on we groped, and lo! it wound and wound By tortuous ways, now narrow, and now wide, Now soaring to a dome, now sinking low, That I for fear fell weeping, till you said, âMaids that are married should take shame to fear.â And so we walked or crawled, till the one way Split into many:âthat to rightward leads To a blind outlet by a fallen oak Beneath the western towerâbut we held on, And came at last unto a little door That opened in a wall, and, peering up, Saw stairs in the wall's thickness, and you too Grew fearful, and we fled. That door I found In a forgotten vault. The way is hard, And dark, and slippery; but once learn the clue, And win to that low cave, the lake is nigh: Ere nightfall you will gain the convent towers. Alberto. I could not find it with a thousand eyes Teresa. And I, with none, can guide you. Alberto. This indeed Is light from darkness. Bianca. Let us go. Alberto. But how Can memory serve you to retrace the way? Teresa. Perchance things vanish from the boy's quick brain, Which girls forget not. 'Tis enough to say, Waking or sleeping, I could find the track. Dear was the spot to me in life, and, dead, My ghost shall haunt it. Will you come, my lord? Alberto. Lead forward in God's name. Count Carlo, live Till our next meeting! Teresa. First, strip off your arms: Their bulk would sore impede you, and one clank Against the hollow rock might ruin all. Alberto. How if we meet the foe? Teresa. That must be dared: There is no going else. The narrow walls So pinch and hamper, 'tis with much ado A great-limbed man may pass them. I smell fire! Bianca. Alberto, we may trust her. [She unbinds his armour, which, with his sword and dagger, he lays on the table. Teresa. Follow me. [Exeunt, B. [A short pause, during which the stage remains empty, and the battering of the outer door is heard, till a louder crash, followed by shouts, announces that it has fallen. A sound of footsteps approaching; after which enter, B, Luigi, followed by an Officer and five or six of Count Carlo's soldiers. Twilight falls gradually. Luigi. This is the chamber where I left her last, And thought to find both; but the birds are flown. Officer. Being no birds, it is not to be thought They can have quit the castle, therefore search. [To the soldiers, who begin searching. Luigi. Search as you please, and yet 'tis like enough They have escaped our clutches, birds or no, Having a mole to guide them. Officer. So to fall Into Count Carlo's ambush? Luigi. Ay, unlessâ But no, for there's naught womanish in her, Though woman; and what makes the weak heart crack, Fierce jealousy, and fire of slighted love, Welds her stern fibre into constant iron. Officer. Whose are these weapons, and this armour? Luigi. Ah! Whose but my brother's? 'tis the very sword I gave him for his bridal-gift to-day, Unbrotherly, ungraciously cast off, As in assurance of escape. [Goes to the window. Officer (to soldiers). What ho! Leave loitering here, and search the castle through, Some this way, and some that. (Exeunt soldiers.) Now, by your leave, I'll after them, and rummage high and low, From roof to dungeon. Luigi. Stop! Betrayed, by heaven! Officer. Ha! see you aught? Luigi. Come hither! Is it so, Or are mine eyes fooled by the failing light? Officer. I see a boat that creeps along the lake In the dark shadow of the shore. Luigi. And in it? Officer. Two forms, methinks, a woman and a man. Luigi. Yes, yes, but where's the third? there should be three. Yet no, she would not join them, howsoe'er The plot miscarried, but would break away, Mad with baulked passion, or creep back to die. Hie thee to Carlo! while I tarry here. [Re-enter soldiers hastily. Officer (to soldiers). Well, what's amiss? why stand you gaping thus? Soldier. The castle's wrapped in fire that gains apace: Black smoke e'en now comes billowing up the stair, And smothers all. We know not where to turn. Luigi. Death and confusion! I had thought to trap The fox in her own hole, and you must needs With your curs'd fire-brands smoke me out of it. I'll guide you to the water-gate, then back, And the fiend help me: there may yet be time. [Exeunt, B. [Another short pause. Music. Smoke curling up in places through the floor. The dusk increases. Enter Teresa, B, with distracted air. Teresa. What have I done? I cannot compass it. God, help me to remember! O undo This double being, or make me not to be! Two visions are before me: ay, two hearts Knock at my bosom, two brains burst my brow! And all I can serves nothing to atone The clamorous discord. Let me think it out. [Sinks into a seat. First, step by step, that, like an anvil's clang, Smote on the winding stair; the strait low door, That would not yield, and yielded; the loud breaths In the pent passage, the slow-feeling hands And groping feet between the gallery-walls, Walking and crouching, till we cameâwe came To the diverging ways. There doubt begins. Which did I take, and whither? That is what Confounds me. Am I doomed never to know? Yet it seems plain; the pause, the leftward path, The low-browed cavern, and the fallen oak, The rush of men, the shriek, Alberto dead! Alberto dead! Yes, yes, for now I scent The breath of hell already! hell within, Hell all around! both smouldering, soon to burst! O what wild storm of greeting will there be, When fire meets fire! Yet tarry, not so fast! As plain, or plainer, to my thought comes back The quick turn rightward, the heaped stones to scale, Scarce yielding body-room, where the low roof Bowed down to meet them; the one stone that fell, And woke the yelping echoes; the five bells Pealing and dinning in mine ear through all, âAlberto, we may trust herâ; then at last That other cave, our childhood's bridal bower; Yes, yes, the daisied turf, the lake, the boat, And in it I beside them; the wild leap To shore, and the wet garments! Let me feel: Joy! I have found it: they are dripping still! But is it bloodâAlberto's blood? No, no, [Putting her face to them. The sweet lake water! I have lost, and won. Burn up, brave fire! seethe, curdling smoke! 'tis yours To crown this sacrifice! Luigi (without). Teresa, where, Where art thou? Teresa. Hark! It is the fiend that calls! No, no, not now, you cannot claim me now. The sweet lake water, it has washed me pure. Luigi (without). 'Tis I, Luigi! help is at hand: Wait but a moment! Teresa. Where's my dagger?âgone! [Takes Alberto's from the table. Ah! here's a better. (Kisses the hilt.) Be Alberto's self, Dear dagger; pierce me to the heart! [She thrusts it into her side, and sinks to the ground. Luigi (bursting in, B, through the smoke). Help ho! Teresa, wake! I come to rescue thee. Teresa (half-rising). Rescuedâalready! [Dies. Luigi. Death and hell! too late! [He staggers towards door, R, but falls stifled by the smoke Curtain.</field>
