      <field name="fulltext">? Faber Imus, &amp; Ungues Exprimet, &amp; Molles imitabitur Ã¦re Capillos, Infelix operis summÃ¢, qui ponere totum Nesciet: Hunc ego me, si quid componere curem Non magis esse velim, quam pravo vivere naso Spectandum, nigris Oculis nigroque Capillo. Horat. de Art. Poet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, CHARLES Earl of Orrery, Knight of the most Antient Order of the Thistle. The Story of Perolla and Izadora was the Product of the Earl of Orrery Your Lordship's Noble Grandfather's leisure Hours in the Fam'd Romance of Parthenissa, which I found so irresistably Inviting, that I cou'd not help Aspiring (beyond what some People are pleas'd to call my Talent) in this Attempt of Forming it into a Tragedy: For I saw so many Beautiful Incidents in the Characters, and so just a Distress in the Passions, that I had little more than the Trouble of Blank Verse to make it fit for the Theatre: So that the Faults in the Figure it now makes are wholly owing to its present Dress, and not an Original want of Beauties. Just before I hurry'd it upon the Stage, Your Lordship did me the Honour of Adjusting its Garniture, the Expression: Wherein I must own my Vanity was sufficiently mortified, to see after all my flattered Hopes and Care, how little I had been doing. But my Disquiet from Criticism was soon allav'd by the Advantage of the Instruction: And tho' I dare not yet say, 'tis wholly excusable, yet I am bound to acknowledge, that Your Lordship's Perusal has left it several secret Faults fewer than it had: By the good Fortune of which Assistance it has been the better able to make its way through a favourable Third and Sixth Day, to claim its farther (I might say Native) Right to Your Lordship's Protection. Nor can I repent in the Possession of that Hope, which perhaps first drew me into Helicon a little out of my depth: Tho' I never thought it in danger of sinking, after I found Your Lordship thought it worthy Your Correction: For as I knew it impossible to make Faults, that Your Judgement wou'd not find, so I knew Your Understanding wou'd not find any, if the whole were incorrigible. This will easily be believ'd by those that know Your Lordship's Strength in Poetry, to which your Genius is not only Great and Easie, but Inherent. And tho' it is the Misfortune of Poetry to stand in the Rank of neglected Arts, and to make few Men considerable, who have no other Quality to recommend 'em; yet in our Account of Mankind (tho' the Greatest Men have follow'd the Muses, yet) History tells us of a Thousand Hero's for One Great Poet. But your Lordship makes a right Use of the Art: You have the Power of Writing well, tho' you now forbear it, and rather choose to be Eminent according to the Age's Understanding. The Field is now in Fashion, and Your Lordship has prudently stept into the Ranks of Mars, when due Occasion shall call You forward to share in the Defence of Your Country. And as late Experience tells us, how Discerning Her Majesty's Judgement has been in the Distribution of Her Favours; so we may modestly conclude, that Her Foresight does not a little rely on the Promises of Your Lordship's growing Reputation, by the late Honours done Your Lordship, Enrolling you a Companion of that Order, which carries a peculiar Veneration in its Title, The most Ancient Order of the Thistle. But I am drawing my self into a Subject, that less needs a Panegyrick, than I shou'd Your Lordship's Pardon, shou'd I continue it. I will therefore beg leave to subscribe my self, with all Submission, My Lord, Your Lordship's Most Obedient and Most Humble Servant, Colley Cibber.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Since Otway's Scenes how few have found the Art, To touch the Passions, and command the Heart? And yet from much Inferiour Pens, we know, That Tears from happy Tales ill told will flow: How gross the Error thenâ To think in Plays, that Language is the whole? The Stile is but the BodyâFable is the Soul; We boast no Beauties, nor from Faults are free, Yet we dare promise what you shall not see; And when we others Faults with Caution shun, 'Tis the first step t'have sewer of our own: First then our Muse has clipt her Wings to Night, Our Pegasus, as made for speed, not flight, Strains fairly o're the Turf, nor soars from Nature's sight. No Big-mouth'd Words the want of Thought supply, Nor scale the Ransack'd Heavens for Simile; No Scene for Talkings sake's brought useless on, Nor main Design concludes before the Play is done. No soft-soul'd Monarch pines for slighted Love, While the coy Nympth his Humours to remove Can't bear t'account, but lumps him out her Charms, And with a generous Jump flies Rampant to his Arms, No Ranting Heroes with loud Glory swell, Nor build their Fame on Deeds impossible: No Parlying Armies battle on the Stage, While wrangling Chiefs in Wars of Words engage; Nay, we've neglected too, tho' much in fashion, To murther Innocence to move Compassion; Nor yet to raise your Terror can we boast, One dreadful Rising of a meal-fac'd Ghost: No Thunder roars, nor Lightning gilds the Sky, To usher down a dangling Deity. Wonders like these we have not chose to shew, For nothing's Great, that's not in Nature True: The Scenes we chose to shew you, only crave They may at least a friendly Sentence have; For what Severity might kill, Advice may save: Let 'em your Warning, not your Censure see; For 'twou'd, methinks, a kind of Justice be, To give the Muse a safe Retreat to Comedy. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. Oldfield. Well, Sirs! you've seen a Prodigy to day: Two Lovers true! in this old-fashion'd Play; But these were Romans: Our more modish Age No such Examples shews, but on the Stage: Of all the Sparks, that sigh and ogle here, (Hold! let me seeâ) the Chief are There, and There. [Pointing to the Side-Boxes. Shew me but one that wou'd expose his Life, To gain that Comfortable Thing, a Wife: But here, how many Husbands do I see [The Pit. Wou'd gladly venture Hanging to get free! I wish Perolla may not soon increase The dismal Melancholick List of these: Our Hearts, when marry'd, we but ill defend, For that's the Time to gratifie a Friend; Maids are unpractis'd, nice, and blush to try What most they wish, and fear they know not why: But Wives grow bold, and find when better taught, The Danger's not so great, as once they thought. Such Wives there may be, Sirs, but Oh! how few Of us are false, compar'd to sinful You. The Faults, that by our injur'd Sex are done, Are owing to the Vices of your own: Fond to Provoke, you take the Manly way, To Swear and Lye, to Flatter and Betray; Such is your Humour, or your Weakness such, You cannot bear to be Belov'd too much: But roving on, new Conquests only prize, Giving to All what scarce wou'd One suffice; And such tame Fools do you our Sex believe, Not to requite the Favours we receive. Wou'd ye Gallants but fairly Play your Parts, And know the Value of our faithful Hearts; Wou'd ye the Grounds of our Complaints remove, And make Returns of Constancy and Love; You then wou'd find us Objects fit to trust, For we are true, when ever you are just: You then wou'd live with greater Pleasures blest, Than e're in Love's soft Empire were possest; For every Lover in his Fair wou'd find True English Charms with Roman Virtue joyn'd.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE Blacius his House. Enter Blacius and Izadora. Bla. Pacuvius' Son! Detested Thought! is heâ (The only Wretch I've warn'd thee to avoid) Is he the Choice of thy abandon'd Love? How cou'd thy vile degenerate Heart, At horrid Mention of Perolla's Flame, Forbear to call up all thy vital Warmth Into thy fierce disdainful Eyes, And look him dead with a victorious Scorn? O that I live to think my only Child In Thought but mingles with Pacuvius' Blood! Iza. [Kneeling] O my offended Father! By all my past Obedience, by my Mother's Truth, And by th'Endearments of paternal Love, I do conjure you give my Crimes a hearing, And if in all my Conduct to Perolla, My Actions or my Thoughts stand blameable; Nay, if the Conflicts of my struggling Heart 'Gainst his compulsive Virtues, that engag'd it, Merit not at worst your Pity of my Fortune, Then shut me forth an Exile from your Care, To wander branded with a Parent's Curse Of unforgiven Disobedience. Bla. I take thee at thy Word: And let me warn thee well, [Raising her. Before I lend my Patience to thy Cause, That thou abuse it not with weak Defences, Lest my Resentment shou'd with double Right Be just to thy Undoing. Iza. So may I justly meet it, or avoid, As my Defence shall Censure or Acquit me. Bla. Then tell me, say, How cam'st thou first to set Thy watchless Eyes upon this fatal Wretch, When I thou know'st with such revolving Care Still bred thy Youth in Courts from him remote, To keep it (if 'twere possible) beyond The working Power of Fate to join you ever? Iza. Lend yet your Patience, and the Fact will prove Not Izadora, but her Fate to blame. Bla. Proceed, while yet my Temper holds to hear thee. Iza. When Conqu'ring Hannibal's Vindictive Arms In CannÃ¦'s fatal Field had late prevail'd A few press'd Romans, who escap'd his Sword, Retreated to the Town (where you t'avoid Perolla's sight had plac'd me with my Unkle Magius. It chanc'd a Party of Numidian Horse Pursued these flying Romans to the Gates, Which in Victorious Pride they entring said, They wanted not to seize, but kindly came, They vaunting cry'd, to mend the Roman Breed On their young Wives and Daughters: On the Word, Strait to the Temple (where our Fears had shut us T'implore the Gods) the cruel Victors came, And from our Orisons with Brutal Force The Wives and Virgins dragg'd relentless forth, Whose piteous Cries and Shrieks so pierc'd the Hearts Ev'n of the lost and conquer'd Romans there, That Rage Despair and Horror at the sight, Gave 'em a new and treble Courage to protect us, When strait they Fierce as darted Lightning flew With swift Destruction on the Ravishers: And in the Front of our Deliverers, A Youth with straining Fury in his Eyes Seizing the Wretch, whose impious Hand was bound Fast in my Folded Hair, at one bold Stroke Unlock'd his horrid Hold, And laid him Gasping at my Feet: At length this Brave Example and the Cause Prevail'd; Half the Numidians slain, The rest in Fear retreated to their Camp: So Great, so Generous an Actionâ Bla. Hold! Your Praises may be spar'd, the Action speaks It self; and to be just, I will suppose Perolla Unknowing who you were was your Preserver. Iza. It was indeed Perolla! Yet my Heart Not more was pleas'd with Life so greatly sav'd, Than griev'd to find the Obligation due Where your Commands had told me I must Hate. Bla. Thus far thou art my Daughter still: But say What at Petilia past: For there I find Thy Childish Heart was flatter'd to thy Ruine. Iza. Know then, that there he was a second time His Country's brave Deliverer, and mine: From our Escape at CannÃ¦, to Petilia next His Arms conducted us, where scarce arriv'd But Hannibal's pursuing Force besieg'd us: At which the fearful Magistrates allarm'd, Conclude on Shameful Terms to yield the Town; But He Perolla firm opposing them, They secret Plot without him to surrender, And knowing too me yet neglectful of his Love, Propos'd upon my Woman's Fears, that I Shou'd by my Person promis'd to his Vows Engage his Vote to yield in their Design; Or if I'd then Betray him to their Hands, They'd full Revenge me on his painful Passion, And send him Captive with their Terms to Hannibal. Bla. Most impious Traytors! But I hope you yielded not To such Proposals, tho' my Mortal Foe, I wou'd not Hurt him with my Country's Ruine. Iza. O far from such a Thought! I held in just Abhorrence their Disloyal Fears, and to Perolla strait their Vile Proposals told, While He upon the instant fir'd to see me place So kind, unhop'd a Confidence in him, Secures in Chains the false Conspirators, And from th'Example of his glowing Virtue So warms the Soldiers to exert their Arms, That (on a Council held) they sally forth, And in one Glorious Action raise the Siege. Bla. And He on this slight Victory presuming, Tells his Big Tale, pleases your Female Pride, And, 'cause he sav'd Petilia, you were taken. Iza. Yet hear my Fortune, And in your utmost Prejudice you'll own I yielded not till storm'd By farther Obligations to surrender. For at his glad return from that Victorious Salley, The Wives, the Matrons by his Sword preserv'd; The grateful Virgins too, More tender of his long neglected Love, In his behalf came kneeling to my Feet, And in such soft Persuasions urg'd his Passion, Sung with such moving Notes his Godlike Vertue, With their Necessity of now Rewarding it, So gently too reproach'd my Heart's Delay, That I too conscious of my own Demerits, Striving in vain to hide my speaking Blushes, In Tears fell prostrate to the Earth, and beg 'em, That they'd reproach no more my Virgin Fears; But if they thought this Trifle of my Person Were a Reward for any one that had Deserv'd my Country's Favour, to dispose it As they shou'd pleaseâ At this they caught me in their Friendly Arms, And press'd me with a Thousand thankful Kisses, While some Transported to Perolla flew, Whose doubtful Heart cou'd scarce believe their Joy: But when for proof approach'd in sight of me, Seeing my Tears, my Trembling, and my Blushes, He rush'd like frighted Life to its Protection, Flew to my Yielded Hand, and Fainted at my Feet: Thus, Sir, you see 'tis to the Cause of Rome, And not Perolla's Charms, that I have given my Heart. Nay he Perolla too at my Request, Now from Petilia having sent me first To render both our Duties to a Father. [Gives a Letter. In just Obedience waves all Nuptial Hopes, Till your kind Sanction shall confirm him Happy. Bla. My Daughter! O my Dearest Izadora! Well hast thou wrought thy Tale to melt my Temper, Nor can I call thy fatal Love thy Fault, But thy Misfortune Nowâ Find but another Name for lost Perolla, And he were yet, in spite of Prejudice, The First of Men I'd offer to thy Wishes: But as he is the false Pacuvius Son, The hateful curst Pacuvius, who before His Treacherous Revolt to Hannibal Was still thy Father's Mortal Foe: As such I must detest him, cou'd he prove his Blood from Jove: Has not for Nine Descents our House implacable Held out to his a fix'd Hereditary Hate? And shall we now, by so abhorr'd a Union, Basely distain our Great Fore-fathers Honour? Shall that expended Blood, which never yet Has mix'd with theirs, but on the reeking Earth, Flowing from mutual Wounds of unappeas'd Revenge, At last now ebb to the tame Quality Of a Supine and Listless Love? Dishonour! Death! and Tortures!â âAnd yet my Izadora is undone! By Obligations bound, that Conscious Honour, (And O I fear more punctual Love!) Can never see unpaid! What will the Gods do with me? Iza. My dearest Father, on my Knees I beg, Let not your Fears for me divide your Breast With this Perplexity of Thought: For tho' My Soul can witness, that I'll sooner dye, Than wrong the Friendship that I owe Perolla, Yet rather than forego my Duty, I wou'd resist my greatest Happiness. Bla. Preserve that Thought, as thy first Hopes of Peace, Or losing it expect Resistless Ruine. Enter a Servant. Ser. My Lord, a Gentleman call'd Decius, and In haste intreats to be admitted. Bla. Conduct himâ We must defer this Cause, my Izadora, Something Superior now demands my Thought, If thou canst quit Perolla, I am happy; If not, when I can crown thy Wishes With a Reserve to my untainted Honour, Depend upon a Father's Love. Iza. I ask no more, or of the Gods, or You. [Ex. Iza. Enter Decius. Bla. Thou'rt welcome Decius, doubly welcome, Now What says the Consul to our New-born Hopes? Are they approv'd, or are we Slaves to Carthage? Dec. Masters, I hope my Lord: But how those Hopes Go forward am I sent to learn of you. Are the Salapians still resolv'd? Bla. All Firm, and restless to Retrieve, or to Revenge their Honour, and their Freedom lost, Which daily now th'Insulting Hannibal, Regardless of the Bonds on which he enter'd here Most Tyrant-like incroaches on: For know The false Pacuvius, tho' he wrought indeed A spleenful Faction to betray the Town, Yet with his utmost Skill cou'd on no easier terms Deceive the Populace t'unbar the Gates, Than first of twenty Days compleat allow'd For ev'n those Votes, that had oppos'd his Entrance, To make their Choice for Rome, or Hannibal, Which is indeed for Death or Slavery, As my wrong'd Brother Magius Blood severe has prov'd. Dec. How! Magius Dead! As a Delinquent Dead! Are these his Proofs of Faith? Of what accus'd? Bla. I'll tell thee Decius. My Brother seeing of late the Slave Pacuvius Fawning, and Supple to the Imperious Nod Of Hannibal (whom he five Days before Had call'd his Country's Execrated Foe) His Boiling Heart, in Horror of the Sight, Ev'n to the Carthagineans Front burst forth Into such sharp Invectives on Pacuvius, Urging how much a Hero's Soul shou'd scorn The abject Friendship of so vile a Wretch, That tho' he lov'd the Treason, yet shou'd hate the Traytor: Stern Hannibal incens'd as much at what his Sword Had done, as what his Tongue then talk'd against him. Swore on the Instant he shou'd kneel, and ask Pacuvius Pardon, or that Instant die: Which Magius answering with a scornful Smile, That Moment by the Guards was dragg'd along, And on the common Shambles lost his Head. Dec. O most Unhospitable Deed! And how, my Lord, do the Salapians take it? Bla. As you may guess, by what I now from them Have to the Consul late propos'd: They hate This Deed, and by this Town restor'd to Rome, Resolve immediate to Revenge it. Dec. And Right at once the Cause of Rome, and Blacius. Bla. For me it matters not: My pleas'd Despight Is half by Fortune acted on Pacuvius. I've liv'd at last to see him False and Perjur'd; False to his Gods, and Hateful to Mankind: For what can more deserve to be abhorr'd, Than the vile Slave, that dares betray his Country? Dec. The greatest Justice that his Crimes can meet Were from his greatest Foe to find his Punishment: And that I hope the Gods reserve for you. Bla. Lift but my Eye-lids up Ye Powers to see That Day, and let the Hand Of Fortune close 'em then for everâ We talk away the Time: How near's the Roman Army to Salapia? Dec. Six Leagues this Morning was their utmost Distance, And that their last Advances may be made The Consul first has sent me for Advice, To know what Numbers here were firmly Yours, How soon they cou'd be ready to receive 'em, What Gate wou'd easiest open to his Force, And if to Night he may begin his silent March? Bla. First for our Numbers, our AccountsâBut hold, It won't be safe too far to charge your Memory; I better shall dispatch my self in Writing, You'll pardon, Sir, a Moment's Trespass on Your Patience.â Enter a Servant. Ser. My Lord, Pacuvius stays, from Hannibal He says to treat with you. Bla. Pacuvius, ha! 'Twere too much hazard, Decius, shou'd he find You hereâRetire a Momentâ I guess his Business, which I'll soon dispatch, And then return to our Affair. Dec. My Lord, I shall attend your leisureâ [Ex. Decius. Bla. Where is he? Ser. He walks, my Lord, without upon the Pavement; And when I ask'd him if he'd please to Enter, He stern reply'd me, No! I'll here see Blacius. If he wont come, I'm answer'd, in his silence. Bla. Now our Design's so near a Head, it won't Be safe to slight a Thought from Hannibal, Tho' my swoll'n Heart disdains the Converse of This TraytorâShew me,â Ex. Bla. and Ser. The SCENE drawing Discovers Pacuvius alone in a Piazza before Blacius's House. Pac. Fool that I am! I've hazarded too far! Shou'd Blacius now embrace the Offers I Must make, again my weak Revenge might fail me: For rather than partake one Cause with him, I wou'd again revolt from Hannibal. Since more my Spite to Blacius, than Regard To Carthage, has reduc'd me False to Romeâ'Tis true I've promis'd Hannibal to tempt his Faithâ âI'll keep my Wordâbut keep the Statesman too, Who order'd to sollicit what himself dislikes, Takes care his manner of Persuasion may Prevail to get the thing refus'dâHe comes. Enter Blacius. Bla. Thou hit'st me well, Pacuvius, and I'm glad Thy Pride refuses thee to enter here, Where Custom wou'd, I own, have bound me up To Hospitable Forms, which my Sincerity Disdains to pay the Man I hate. Pac. And to avoid Civilities from thee Have I disdain'd to enter, and be these The only Forms that ever pass between us. Bla. I greet thee with an equal Scorn, 'Tis wellâDeliver now thy Message. Pac. My Message! What! think'st thou I am like thee? A Slave to be commanded? Bla. No: For to thy Fears and Falshood thou'rt a Slave, By Rome abhorr'd, whose Cause thou hast betray'd; By Hannibal despis'd, to whom thou art A Slave, while I am only Captive from The Chance of War, or rather not of Warâ Pac. But meâI hated thee, and I betray'd thee; And 'tis indeed my Soul's most comfortable Thought, To know that I have ruin'd thee. Bla. On to thy Business. Pac. To Business thenâFrom Hannibal I come To know, if yet thou hast resolv'd thy Choice; Twelve of the Twenty Days allow'd are past, And much he wonders at thy cold Regard Of all those Courteous Liberties, which he Unbound allows: No Guard upon thy Doors, No Persons question'd in Regress, or Entrance, Confin'd in nothing but thy Word for Residence; And in return to all these Favours, thou Not only doest delay thy own Alliance, But with thy best Persuasions doest retard Others inclin'd from their declaringâNow I have discharg'd my Trust to Hannibal; But to be honest to the Hate I owe thee too, I plain confess I wish thee still his Enemy; Nor wou'd I be a Monarch in that State, That wou'd accept a Friend in Blacius: I've said, and nowâthy Answer. Bla. This: Tell Hannibal, tho' Twelve, Yet not the Twenty Days agreed are past; Till then he's bound in Honour not to urge My Choice, which yet it lists me not to make: And for the boasted Courtesies he does me, I've little tasted them since Magius Death. Pac. I had forgotâThat too was wrought by me. Magius had offended me, and I destroy'd him. Bla. O! give me Patience! Thou! the honest Truths He spoke of thee consider'd in his Death, Wou'dst thou ascribe what Hannibal before Resolv'd, as done i'th'least regard to thee? Away, thy little Spleen was never thought on! Thou! Audacious Vanity! Pac. I tell thee, it was IâI gave thy Brother Death, But thou'rt in Passion, and thy peevish Pride Is touch'd to find thy Sorrows due to me. Bla. Is Passion then a Crime, when such as thou Escape Jove's Thunder, and infest Mankind! If Rage, or generous Resentment, be For Wrougs yet unreveng'd, a Crime; 'tis sure The only one thy Soul yet never knew. Pac. 'Tis False! Nor is there in the horrid Scroll Of Deeds facinorous a Crime, at which my Soul Wou'd stop to prove my pointed Hate to Blacius: Nay, if thou think'st 'tis Tameness makes me Cool, I on occasion can be Loud as thee; My Blood, as soon as thine, can boil to Passion, My Eyes with equal Fire confront thy Rage, My Sword with a superior Fury meet thee, âBut as thou art the Man I'm born to hate, Whose anxious Life I rather shou'd preserve To feed my Gall upon thy lingring Woes, Methinks 'tis more tormenting to thy Spleen, T'insult the thusâwith calm deliberate Malice. Bla. Hear this ye Powers! Pac. One thing I farther too shou'd tell thee of, (For I confess it is a feeling Pleasure With such Excesses to afflict thy Soul) Letters this Morn inform me, that my Son Perolla In a late Sally at Petilia's Siege, Has push'd his Youthful Gallantry so far, That in thy Daughter Izadora's Eyes The Action had such sweet Romantick Charms, Sh'as quite forgot our Family's fierce Hate, Disowns her Father, and pursues his Love, I cannot say indeed she sigh'd in vain, But I believe his Longings may be over, For I am told the Boys satiety Has since dismiss'd her home again to thee. Bla. Notorious! Damn'd, invented Falshood! But that I've now a better way to gall Thy Heart, my Sword shou'd right her injur'd Fame. See there, the Stab to thy retorted Malice; [Gives him Perolla's Letter. Read there, who most forgets the Fathers's Hate: From his own Hand thy conquer'd Son's her Slave, In Terms submissive begs he may Espouse her, He burns, he dies with Horrour to Enjoy her; And let him perish, die and rot with lean Despair, For cou'd (which is impossible) my Rage suppose, That after my accumulated Wrongs, And now thy spotted Malice to her Fame, My Child cou'd think in favour of thy Son, Perdition seize me, but these honest Hands From her degenerate Breast shou'd rip her Heart, And dash it in the Face of curs'd Perolla. [Having read the Letter. Pac. Damnation! Marry her! Bla. What is thy Pride confounded at the News? Nay then at once to strike thee dumb for ever, My Izadora! Ho! Come forth, thy Father calls! Now thou shalt see that dire Revenge so long Delay'd of our Contesting Houses Hate, In conquering Izadora's Eyes at last To ample Expiation is reserv'dâ Enter Izadora. I call'd thee, Izadora,âMark me well! There stands the Man, whose Ancestors to thine, As thine to his, for now Two Hundred Years Have liv'd, and gloried in a ceaseless Hate; The Man, to whose perfidious Spite thou ow'st Thy Father's Bondage, and thy Country's Ruine, The Man who to my Face this instant now Has thrown such vile Aspersions on thy Fame, Thy Modesty wou'd sink shou'd I repeat 'em, Now then consider wellâ That on thy just Resentment of these Wrongs Depends our Houses Honour, and thy Fame's Revenge: I think thou art my Daughter, and it were To doubt thy Virtue shou'd I urge thee more; But as thou'rt conscious of no Stain deserv'd, I now conjure thee by thy Mother's Tomb, By her most dread Regards to spotless Fame, And by the Father's Pangs of injur'd Honour, Let thy disdainful Eyes exert their Art T'avenge our mutual Wrongs on curs'd Perolla's Heart. [Exit Blacius with Izadora. Pac. What grinning Fury from invidous Hell. Has plotted with this Fiend to grate my Soul! My Son! Perolla! O abandon'd Boy! Do I behold my Treasure of Revenge, Which I in Avarice of Hate had like A Self-denying Miser hoarded up For my Support in feebler Spleens, Old Age At last exhausted by a Woman's smile, Consum'd in Folly by a spendthrift Boy, And drain'd in Riots of degenerate Love! Nor stops the Horror there, but forms new Fears: What if in spite to me, as I to him, The Vengeful Blacius shou'd comply with Hannibal, Become his firm Ally, and then perhaps His servile Arts, as they prevail'd with Rome To get himself in scorn preferr'd to me, May possibly alike succeed with Carthage, And so a second time insult my Fortune! Ten Thousand Ponyards are within me, âBe hush'd my Heart, a Beam of dawning Thought Darts to my Brain, and forms Reviving Easeâ âThe Means I haveâwhy not Resolve the Deed? 'Tis doneâmy Vengeful Heart's at rest, and Blacius-dead. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Second. The SCENE, a Garden to Pacuvius his House. Enter Pacuvius, and Three Romans. Pac. You saw how Hannibal receiv'd his Answer. 1st Rom. Be sure it stung his Pride to be so slighted. 2d Rom. Blacius methinks from Magius Death Might better have been warn'd, Than to insult his Conqueror. 3d Rom. What hinders Hannibal to use him then like Magius? Pac. Why this, Magius was hot, a headstrong Foe; But Hannibal in Blacius hop'd a Friend, And therefore gave his Honour when he enter'd here To be himself his GuardâNow that's the Bar: But shall we think, that Blacius Death wrought by Some private means unknown to Hannibal (Whatever Face in show he might put on) In his close Heart wou'd not to the last oblige him? 1st Rom. Impossible but so. 2d Rom. It must of course. Pac. When Great Men frown upon a stubborn Foeâ 3d Rom. They seldom count him such, that ends him. Pac. RightâAll Actions can't have publick Thanks, But this I know, That Minister, who lays up no Rewards For secret Service will have little done, Or in the Camp or State: Shall I be plain? I think you are my Friends, I'm sure I've cause To think you are, since at my suit the Cause Of Rome with me disdaining you've deserted; Which Thought alone consider'd, 'twere in me The worst Ingratitude, shou'd I neglect To push your friendly Fortunes with my own: What need I words? You've now th'Occasion in Your hands: One Blow compleats your Wishes; Shew your selves Men, and I'm in Honour bound To whisper your Deserts to Hannibal. 3d Rom. My Lord, you have propos'd us well; but each Man speak his own Opinion: For my self I ever thought in Actions desperate Long Pauses shew'd a cold Consent. Pac. My Friendsâyou seeâI'm plainâwho likes the offer? 1st Rom. I. 2d Rom. And I. 3d Rom. Then all of us. Pac. Pacuvius then's the Agent of your Fortunes, [Bowing to them all. You know the Platform, where his own House stands, There every silent shiny Night alone He moody walks, and chews his Discontent, The properest place, I think, to end his Cares; I need not say he's sure: For you are Three, The Fact once done, and you unknown escap'd. With secret pleasure Hannibal receives The News: Yet in his seeming Rage proclaims Rewards for them that bring th'Assassins forth, On which I smiling tell him in his Ear, That were these barb'rous honest Fellows known, The Troops now vacant need not want Commanders. 3d Rom. If I don't head one soon, it sha'nt be want Of Merit. 2d Rom. âPush, as far as any Man. 1st Rom. I long to meet this Blacius. Pac. I long to bring you all Commissions. 3d Rom. Why do we loyter then? Pac. 'Tis now about his Hour. 3d Rom. His last, my Lordâyou'll hear of us. [Ex. Romans. Pac. Here at my own House I shall expect youâso! Now Blacius, our Accounts are even. Enter a Servant with a Light. Ser. My Lord, a Roman now without presents You this, and begs your speediest Answer. Pac. Give me the TaperâHa! Perolla's Hand: (Reads) âForgive me, if my Heart confesses Grief, âTo find my safety doubtful at your Doors: âI've been too firm a Friend to Rome, t'expect âProtection from the Friend of Hannibal; âAnd yet, whate'er the Gods or You design, âI'm still Pacuvius most Obedient Son. Perolla. Give him this Signet with my Honour for His safe Return: The Virtue of this Boy [Ex. Serv. Stirs me to think how far I'm his Inferior, Yetâwhy Inferiorâsay, I've chosen wrong, If I believe it right, I hold my Virtue still: 'Tis not the Truth or Error of his Cause, But as a Man defends the Choice h'as made, That crowns his Fame, or brands him with Dishonour. If in the Cause of Carthage then I err, My Judgment, not my Virtue, is to blame. Here's one that comes, I guess, to question me; But I'm prepar'dâApproach, my Son, 'tis I, Thy Father, speaks; Thou'rt private here, and safe. Enter Perolla. Per. In Thanks thus bending, I receive your Love, The time has been when I durst meet you free In open Day, and unassur'd Protection: Why are these hateful Forms between us now? Pac. Those Times are chang'd. Per. And not Pacuvius? Pac. Noâfor I was always constant to the Cause Of Honour; therefore left the Cause of Rome. Per. Therefore! Stupendious Paradox! Now chang'd indeed! Pac. Rome basely did me wrong, and what I've done Was a Revenge my Conscience ow'd my Merit. The frosty Sieges, and the scorching Camps, Which I had felt in her ungrateful Cause, Deserv'd a better Treatment, than to see My mortal Foe preferr'd before me, Blacius! Why was not I Salapias Governour? Per. In Posts of such Concern Sometimes the high Distempers of a State Necessitate a Wrong like what you think one; The Inclinations of Senate were, I dare affirm more fond of you, than Blacius; But at that time, as Physick to its Feavour, To Purge a Faction, which disturb'd the State, They were content the Clamours of a Party shou'd Extort Preferment for their Leader Blacius. Pac. Mean Slaves! Per. âBut since the fatal Consequence. With what Sincerity 'tis now repented, This from the Senate better will convince you. [Offering a Letter. Pac. Ha! Is't possible! What I treat with me? Alas! Perolla, thou mistakest the Man, Pacuvius! No! No Matter, he's tame unthinking Wretch, Contented with the Burthen of Dishonour! Dogs! I hate 'em more for Fawning than their noisy bark; Yet 'tis a Transport to my Soul to say I have disdain'd to Read their servile Offers; And thou too now, as well as they, shall find I am the same, the constant Roman still; Whose fix'd Resentment of my Honours Wrongs Has made Revenge my Virtue. Per. If not for Rome, for my sake yet at least, Peruse the Terms: For by my Honour's Life They're such as you with Honour may receive: To my Discretion did the Senate yield And gladly offer, what your Son (I hope Your Friend) Proposes. Pac. Nor yet for thy sake will I deign to read 'em: Canst thou too think thy Father's Soul so tame, As to suppose their Provinces cou'd drive me back? What! Bow to Shame! With humble, down cast Looks, Repent a Crime of which my Heart is proud! And in the Vote of an imperious Senate, live A branded, poor, forgiven Rebel! No! Tell 'em, I scorn their Friendship, and their Power, And will with Hannibal chastize their insolence. Per. Nay then I see, all hope to move you's vain, A sateless Passion eats your Reason up, And leaves you but the Fragment of your self. Lost is the Father, and the Roman deaf. Rome, and Perolla bid you now Farewel for ever: Farewel ye Pleasures of exalted Virtue, Whose generous Effects my flatter'd Youth Propos'd shou'd give a new and vital Joy To my declining Father's Age: Now I With dread shall draw my guilty Sword in War, Since every Drop it sheds of hostile Blood Must flow from an offended Father's Wounds! Rome too farewel; thy Cause is desp'rate now! Pacuvius, that supported thee, is lost, Firm Leagu'd with Hannibal to lead thy Sons In Chains, and lay thy Towers in Ashesâ âThe Gods can tellâPerhaps it may be so, And your prevailing Arms success in time May bring the hoary Senate to your Feet Bound, and imploring Pardon of your Wrongs, Which you Triumphant possibly Refuse: Suppose this done, and your best Hopes accomplish'd, Yet where's the Pleasure of this deaf Revenge? To see the Partners of your happier, Life. In their Estates, their Wives, and their Posterity From a Caprice of your impatient Temper made Hereditary Slaves? Can Human Sense Retain a Taste of Joy, that flows from such a Spring? Is the loud World's Applause and Censure priz'd Alike? Or has it more of Happiness To live mistrusted 'mong her Cautious Foes, (For your Revenge, and not your Interest serves 'em) Than in your Country's Cause he try'd a Friend, And end your Days in Native Honour? O! when to future Time our Story shall Be told, how will it stun the Faith of Men To think Perolla had a Roman Father? Pac. Perolla! O what wou'd I not endure One Moment to enjoy thy honest Mind? Thou'st found (I know not how) the wakeful means To Rouze me to a Sense of my Condition; I'll strive a while to Man my Virtue forth, And if I find thee act the like, if thou Like me canst starve thy most Voracious Passion, To feet the joint Revenge of our insulted Honour, 'Tis possible, I yet may read the Terms of Rome. Per. Give me a Proof, my Honour's touch'd with Wrong, My greatest Joys were tasteless to Revenge. Pac. There spoke th'inspir'd Soul of my Perolla, I'll tell thee then, 'tis not so much, I own, Revenge to Rome, as to my mortal Foe, Curs'd Blacius, that has made me leave her Cause: On Him and His the Drouth of my Revenge Is never to be slak'd, but in avow'd Perdition: Now if in that thou provest but half my Son, To Rome and thee I'm whole a Friend and Father. To which how firm my Virtue is inclin'd, Judge by the Violence I do my Heart, When this to Blacius, from thy Hand, I pardon. [Gives him his Letter to Blacius. Per. Thus let me bend in Thanks, and beg to know (For that's the Rock from which you'd steer my Virtue) Wherein my Honour's so concern'd t'avoid My Love! O tell me! For the Thought's a Rack. Pac. (Aside) He warms to my Design. Not then to mind thee of our Houses Hate. Per. That's old, I know it Sir, but onâ Pac. To tell thee then What I this Day from Blacius have endur'd, When I presuming on thy honest Hate, Smil'd at the Fondness of his Blood subdu'd, And urg'd how light thou mad'st of Izadora, Hadst thou beheld with what Insulting Spleen That Letter to my Pride's Confusion he produc'd, With what transported Eyes, and big Disdain, He warn'd his Daughter's Scorn t'avange his Hate on thee. That! that alone might start thee into Madness: It stabs me but to think, that I need Words T'inflame thee to be foremost in thy Pride, And from this glorious Hour to leave with scorn Th'abandon'd Izadora. Per. Foremost wou'd I always be in starts of Honour: But have you proof, that Blacius Dread commands Prevail'd upon his perjur'd Daughter's Faith? Did she, did Izadora yield her Love, And join his Fury in pursued Revenge? Pac. I cannot say I saw her, but be sure His Prayers or Vows against her threatned Life By this time must have mov'd her to abjure thee. Per. If I believ'd, that Prayers or Threats, that Bribes Or Dangers, cou'd unlock the Treasure of her Faith, This Heart, disdainful of her worthless Charms, Shou'd turn her loose, the Mistress of Mankind, To sate the gross Desires of vulgar Love: But as she is, as now my grateful Heart Supposes her, unshaken in her Truth, Tho' with her Father's fatal Rage pursued, Methinks I see him 'gainst her Life resolv'd! Now, now perhaps th'obdurate Blacius Hand Furious directs his lifted Dagger's Point To her unchanging Heart, while she in Plaints And Tears succesless begs for Mercy, then Looks up in Sighs submissive to his Rage, Swells forth her beauteous Bosom to the stroke, When to her Charms Distressâhe drops the Ponyard down. Pac. Suppose, what but thy Fancy paints were trueâ Per. Shall I for such Extremities endur'd Turn Recreant Rebel, and desert her Love? Shall she, whose Temper like a Rock withstood The forceful Onset of the tend'rest Passion, Crown'd with the Merit of her Life preserv'd; Yet when her Country's Cause requir'd the Change, When at her Feet the grateful Virgins kneel'd T'implore her Pity on my Love's Despair, With what Confusion for her Heart with-held, Broke she through all the Bars of ancient Hate, And at Petilia on my Sword's success Resign'd the vast Profusion of her Charms? Shall she in Bloom of Beauty too be left? Such matchless Virtues, and such Love forlorn? O! 'tis an Act so horrid to my sense, It starts my Reason into Fury at the Thought. Pac. No more, I charge thee on thy Life, no more! Canst thou suppose my Sense is pleas'd to hear Thee chaunt the Raptures of thy hateful Passion? Are thy vile Bonds to one my Blood abhors, Yet stronger than thy boasted Zeal to Rome? Is my Alliance too so low esteem'd, Thou'lt rather lose it, than abjure my Foe? What canst thou hope, but in these Thoughts provok'd, I too like thee confin'd by Honour now, Shou'd seize thee lawful Captive of the War, And in the Prisoner chain the Headstrong Son? Be dumb! lest I should yet forego my Mercy: For spite of all thy obstinate Desires, There's something in the Folly of my Pride, That's pleas'd (tho' drawn against thy Father's Cause) To see the young successes of thy Sword; And tho' I now shou'd hold thee as a Foe, Yet Nature pleads, and Fatherâbids thee go. [Ex. severally. The SCENE Opens to the Street: Blacius crosses the Stage, and at some distance, the Three Romans observe him. 1st Rom. Yonder he walks, let's take him while his Back Is towards us. 3d Rom. âThat's not so well: At least dispatch him with the Face of Honour; First hold him in Discourse a while Provoke him with Affronts beyond his Patience, then In Heat of his Resentment end him. 2d Rom. I like that Thoughtâit gives my Conscience ease. 1st Rom. Hark! I hear the Tread of some Approaching us, Let's on before they reach usâ [Exeunt. Enter Perolla, and Strato his Page. Stra. Must we away to Night, my Lord? Per. To Night, my Strato, My Business disappointed so requires: Thou know'st not where the House of Blacius stands. Stra. Not I, my Lord; for tho' I serv'd her long, My Lady Izadora never once Was then within Salapias Walls: But you, My Lord, I thought had long resided here. Per. When I was Young, I am inform'd, I did, But since my Memory can witness, never. Where do the Horses wait us? Stra. Near half a Mile without the Town, my Lord. Per. On then before, my Strato, and prepare 'em: I'll walk a Turn, and overtake thee.â [Ex. Page I know not why, but cannot leave this place; And tho' apparent Danger's in my stay, Yet where my Love resides, my Heart will hover, Fain wou'd I stay, if possible to learn How Beauteous Izadora's Prayers succeed, How far they're lost, or may have gain'd on Blacius. Ha! What sudden Clash of Swords! This way it comes! Either the Moon's pale Light deceives me too, Or I perceive in shameful odds Three Men With Points determin'd upon One Retreating! Enter Blacius, Retreating before the Three Romans. Perolla draws, and Interposes. How now! What means this Midnight Outrage! Hold! Bla. Fortune, I thank thee, yet there's left an Hope. Per. If you are Men that hold your Honour dear, For shame, lay by these most Unmanly, Odds, And singly Hand to Hand decide your Difference. 3d Rom. Presumptious Slave retire, lest on thy self Thou draw'st a Fate design'd alone for him. Per. Nay then his Cause is worthy, of my Sword; Take Courage, Sir, your stronger than you were, They now have me to kill, before they reach you. Bla. O generous Stranger! see how thy Fire has warm'd me. [They Fight. Per. There, Sir: [Kills one.] Now Slaves we are of equal force. 2d Rom. No, Sir, your Courage we have prov'd, and now 'Tis time to try your speed. [They run off. Per. Notorious Villains. Bla. O Godlike Youth! This Generous Act demands More Thanks than this poor Life preserv'd can pay. Per. The Action Sir rewards it self: I must Believe you wrong'd, because your Enemies More trusted in their Numbers than their Cause. Bla. The Gods defend you, Sir you bleedâ Per. 'Tis nothing, Sir, I feel no pain. 3d Rom. Oh! Bla. Ha! What Voice was that? Per. One of th'Assassins dying I suppose. Bla. 'Tis so indeedâif thou would'st hope relief From him, whose Life thou hast tempted, speak, Who set thee on? 3d Rom. With large Rewards and Promises deluded, Pacuvius wrought me to attempt thy Life. Bla. Pacuvius! Damn'd infernal Treachery. Per. My Father! Hail O shameful, Thought! [Aside. 3d Rom. As I am dying what I've told you's true. If this Confession can deserve forgiveness, (For all Relief's too late) O Blacius, pardon! [Dies Per. Ha! Blacius! O my transported Heart! Well have I lost My dearest Blood, if the last Drops of Life [Aside. Have sav'd the Father of my Love. Ha! What means this Flood within my Bosom? Bla. How is it, Sir; You tremble and your Cheek turns pale. Per. I doubt I'm hurt to danger. Bla. Now all good Stars forbid: My House is near, Be pleas'd a while to make it, Sir, your own; There Surgeons shall be call'd to your Relief. Per. In my Condition, Sir, The Favour's not To be refus'd. Bla. âRecline upon my Arm. Per. I thank you, Sir,âThis Care o'er-pays my Service. The Hope's too great! my Pulsive Heart be still, If Izadora's there, the Wounds I feel, Tho' deeper, yet her beauteous Eyes wou'd heal. [Exeunt. Enter Pacuvius alone, with a close Light. Pac. The Noise of Clashing Swords is hush'd, and now The sawcy Blacius presume's at peace, What's that!âBy my fierce Flood of Joys, 'tis He! [Treading against the dead Roman. Supine and Speechless, as a Dunghill Dog! My Blades, I see, have well, perform'd their Work; How now, Friend Blacius! lyest thou at last so low! Cou'd not thy Churlish Breath one Moment more Have lagg'd to let me feed my gloried Ears On the last Groans oft thy Expiring Life? This all the gather'd Fruit of my Revenge To see thee Sensless at my Joy? I want To have thee know my Transport at thy Death. But let me see, perhaps there's left a Grin! On thy distorted Face may flatter me Thou dy'dst in Curses on Pacuvius living. [Opens his Light, and looks on his Face. Distraction! Tortures! Hell! What is't I see? Not Blacius! but the Coward Carkass of The Slave that shou'd have kill'd him. Sure no Wretch Was ever torn by Fortune like Pacuvius! As if the Gods had vow'd my vain Revenge To this excessive Violence shou'd swell To be it self its greater Punishment! Enter Decius. Be hush'd my Thoughts, some one approaches. Dec. This must be sure the House: 'Tis near th'appointed Hour,âyet he's not come: He said himself would privately walk forth. And here expect an Answer from the Consul! Ha! I think I see him! Hist! Lord, Blacius! Pac. Who's there? Dec. 'Tis I, Decius. Pac. Ha! Dec. This from the Consul: All goes well: [Gives him a Letter. Be punctual, and the Consequence will thank you. Pac. Stay, Sir. Dec. It may be dangerous, my Lord, and needs not You'll find it asks for no Reply: Farewell. [Ex. Decius. Pac. 'Tis certain he intended this for Blacius, And by his Fear to stay some close Design, Some secret Practice for the Cause of Rome, (Wherein perhaps curs'd Blacius is concern'd) Lies lurking in this Scrollâmy Soul's impatient. [He reads by his Light.] âTo Morrow, near the Midnight Hour, âThree lighted Torches from the Cittadel âLet be the Sign, that then the Brutian Gate âIs open to our Force's Entrance: âPacuvius, for Perolla's sake, we first âWith friendly Offers by his Son have try'd âTo call again into our Cause, who not âComplying shares the Fate of Hannibal, âBe careful of thy Health: Farewell. The Consul Fabius. This goes to Hannibal, whose Rage allarm'd, In durant Chains confines my Traytor Foe, Whose wisest Thought to free him from this Snare, Will work in vain: For well Experience proves, When Great Men Justice against Great Men crave, Their Step's but short from Prison to the Grave.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Third. The SCENE Blacius his House. Blacius and Perolla: Servants attending. Bla. Not that I've scapt my disappointed Foe, Transports me more, than that my kind Preserver's Wound Appears without a Mark of Danger. And that my abler Gratitude may know To whom the future Service of my Life Is due, your Pardon, Sir, if I presume To ask the Name of my Deliverer. Per. Not for the World's Dominion dare I own it: [Aside. The Service you've receiv'd (in being, Sir, So much, what Man for Man in Honour's bound To do) shou'd Hope no more return, than what's Already paid; therefore I beg I may Conceal my Name, lest I shou'd seem to put You on the Thought of farther Gratitude. Bla. Your Title to command me, Sir, may thus Deprive me of the Means, tho' not the Will to thank you. Yet let me, tho' unknown, thus far intreat you, That till your urgent Business calls you hence, You'll please to make this humble Roof your own. Call forth my Daughter. [To his Servant. Serv. My Lord, I hear her coming. Per. Keep down my buisy Heart; nor let thy Joy [Aside. Confest betray thee to thy Hope's undoing. Enter Izadora. Iza. My Father! Let the Gods for ever thus protect him! I have been told the Dangers you've escap'd, And my transported Heart can bear no bounds. [Embracing his Knees. Bla. 'Tis well my Daughter, and I thank thy Love, But as thou still wou'dst have me think my Life To thee is dear, to the kind Author of Thy Joy assist me in my Thanksâto this Most generous Stranger pour thy Paises forth, [Per. bows to Iza. Whose Life endanger'd has preserv'd thy Father. Iza. O all y'Indulgent Powers! Perolla! [Aside and overjoy'd. Bla. So only shall I judge of thy regard to me, As to his timely Virtue thou art Just: 'Tis now our mutual Cause of grateful Honour, Therefore I charge thee by that sacred Thought, Tune all thy Sexes sweet harmonious Charms, Exert the thrilling softness of thy beauteous Eyes To sooth his Soul, lose no attempt to gain The honest Power of ev'n relieving Gratitude. Per. What do the Gods intend me? [Aside, and pleas'd. Iza. (to Bla.) Sure, Sir, in such a Cause, howe'er My Ignorance may err, you cannot doubt my Will: For judge me, O ye awful Powers! If ever Act, That Human Virtue yet might boast, cou'd more Oblige my Sense, or fill my Heart with half the Joy, As what this Generous Stranger has perform'd: Now, on my Soul, it was a Godlike Deed; And since by your Instruction, Sir, I speak, Forgive me, if my grateful Heart confesses, M'unweary'd Tongue cou'd dwell for ever on its Praise. Bla. Ha! [Pleas'd.] Per. (to Iza.) Such Praises sung by such Inchanting Notes Might lift the Coward to aspiring Thoughts: Therefore take heed, thou bounteous, lovely Maid, Lest what thy Virtue may intend me well, My vainer Hopes shou'd wrest to my Undoing. Bla. By all my Joys he kindles to my Wishes! [Aside. Iza. O never can I reach thy due of Praise! Most Glorious Youth, thou Darling of the Gods! For after this so unforeseen a Chance, That led thee forth to so renown'd a Deed, How many Great and Glorious Actions more Must we conclude their Providential Care, For thy sole Virtue has reserv'd? Bla. (Aside ...) She too delighted in her Sex's Pride, Exerts her pointed Charms, and like Th'Ambitious Hero in his Arms success, Feels no Remorse, or Conscience in her Conquests. (... Aside) Iza. Such Actions make the tend'rest Gratitudeâ A Duty [To Perolla. Bla. Thou God of Love! God of Resistless Fires, Who oft in Female Hearts with Triumph seest Th'unlook'd-for Changes of thy wanton Power, Now to the Aged Votary lend thy Ear, O! to the Follies of her former Love Add yet one more, that may attone the Guilt! Grant her vile Passion for Perolla's Charms, The nobler Flame of this superiour Youth Surmouting may efface, and end my Fears; Let what her seeming Virtue wou'd destroy, Her more implor'd Inconstancy preserve, And on Pacuvius Blood exert my full Revenge. [Aside. Per. Now then's the Proof of this avow'd Compassion. The Gods at last in pity of my Love [To Iza. aside. Have given thee now most Providential means T'elude thy Father's Hate, and crown my Wishes; Thou seest he courts thee to engage my Passion, Let then what his Injustice wou'd refuse Perolla be at once the Cause and just Excuse of thy Compliance, O! my Heart! If now thy Hopes are lost, not Blacius Hate, But Izadora's Cruelty destroys thee. Iza. Dismiss these vain and groundless Fears: For by The endless Obligations which I owe thee, No Bonds, no Bribes, or Threats of Power oppos'd, Shall shake my Firmness of protested Faith; Therefore methinks thy undiscourag'd Love, Which yet untir'd has trod the rocky Paths of Honour, Shou'd not at last Desponding change its way, Or use th'Inglorious Limbs of low Deceit To climb the Mountain Summit of its Joy: Since thy enduring Virtue has in me Subdued the Force of an inherent Scorn, Why shou'd the Plaints of our persisting Duty Despair of Pity from the Conquer'd Blacius? You sha'nt Reproach me with that grieving Look, Since what I mean's but to deserve Perolla. Per. Thou art my Fate, and must dispose me. (To Bla.) I hope your Favour will excuse my Fault, If the Engagement of your Daughter's Charms Have made me, Sir, forget my self to you. Bla. Your Actions, Sir, so far have bound me yours, There's no way left you to increase the Debt, But to inform me how some part I may repay. Per. Not that I think my Service can deserve The friendly Freedom I wou'd beg to take, Yet not to slight your Generosity, Vouchsafe me then your leave to know, how far This Fair One's Heart, or your Consider'd Thoughts, In promis'd Love or Marriage stand engag'd? Bla. How far the Ripening Folly of her Sex May secret have incin'd her Heart, were hard To sayâBut for my self, my Promises Are yet unmade, and were it possible Thy least inclining Thought had made thee Curious, By all the flatter'd Hopes of my Ambition, Most Generous Stranger, I am yet to know The Man my Wishes wou'd prefer to thee. Per. Take heed nor flatter into hope a Wretch, Whose Heart wou'd burn in unoffending Fires. Bla. To give thee then a Proof, I mean my Words; If as thy Deeds have spoke thee, thou canst prove Thee born of Noble Blood, this grateful Hand (Regardless of thy Fortune, tho' depress'd) With Joy, shall yield thee up a Father's Right, To urge Obedience, or persuade her Love To crown thy Wishes with deserv'd Possession. Per. If then my Birth and Fortune both I prove Not, equal to the Noblest Romans Boast, Let, Sir, at once your Scorn destroy my Hopes, And spurn me as my Arrogance deseryes. Bla. Thus then to what my Honour has propos'd, Thus Kneeling to th'attesting Gods I swearâ Iza. Oh! Hold! My too kind Father, yet forbear Your Oathâ Bla. Too kind! What mean thy riddling Tears? Iza. With Joy to give you now a Proof severe, How tenderly my trembling Heart prefers Your Quiet to its own: To let you see No Thought of Happiness can yet surmount The honest Passion of my Filial Love: Tho' now, what you with Oaths have offer'd to perform, Perform'd wou'd crown the utmost Wishes of my Soul; Yet let me rather starve my Hopes for ever, Than by a Wile of guilty Silence bind Your Cheated Honour to Reward my Love. Bla. My startled Thoughts! Iza. For know this Generous Stranger, whom the Gods (In kind addition to his Flames Desert) Had sure decreed shou'd save my Father's Life, Whom you, Unprejudic'd, so high have prais'd, Whose Glorious Actions have o'er-priz'd my Heart, Whom your Commands have press'd me to receive, (O! hear me with Compassion) is Perolla. [Kneeling. Bla. Ha! Iza. The same Perolla, whom your anxious Fears So strict have warn'd me to avoid; yet he, Whose Love our Fate seems since to have resolv'd Shou'd prove at last the Medicinal Balm To heal the Rancour of our Houses Hate. Bla. Distraction! has my Error's Dotage too, [Walking Thoughtfully. Consenting sooth'd him in his fatal Love? Per. My Lord, I find you are, as I foresaw you, stung To feel your Honour plung'd in such Extreams; But yetâif Modesty might speakâ Bla. Pacuvius Son! Remorseless Powers! Why was That hateful Hand reserv'd to give me Life, From which my Death had been the easier pain? Judge me your selves, in all that Life's whole Course, Cou'd ever yet Reproach confront me with An Act, that ought t'have dy'd my Cheeks with Shame. Why then this dire Distress upon my Soul, That to my Bosom I must either take The Man, whom to incessant Rage I hate, Or to the World's Inquiring Tongues expos'd, Must stain my Fame by foul Ingratitude? [Walks disorder'd. Iza. (To Per.) Give him his Thoughts, and let his Passions cool His temper ne'er was long oppos'd to Pity. Bla. No! no! [Beating his Breast.] I'm not so wretched as my Fancy makes me, The self-same Hand, that sav'd, unthank'd, this Life, Has robb'd a Father of his ripe Revenge! Pacuvius murtherous Hope's not only lost, But by his Son defeated! He, whom his Heart's Pride So fondly loves, protecting me has prov'd His greatest Curse, and rakes his harrow'd Soul. Nay he, Perolla too has now himself undone, Had I been kill'd the Bar had been remov'd; Then unoppos'd he had enjoy'd his Love, And o'er m'insulted Grave had danc'd his Joy: But he has sav'd his Foe to blast those Hopes, And dash his Passion with pursu'd Despair. Per. Despair's the surest stab to reach my Heart, Or if you think I may outlive that Wound, Since my dire Father's undefended Crimes So justly have provok'd your due Revenge, Let your keen Sword now wreak it on the Son. Behold my Breast unguarded to your Rage, To meet the Cure of my resistless Ruine. Bla. Yet trust me not too far: For tho' thou sav'dst My hated Life,âThou'rt still Pacuvius Son. Per. I neither can deny, or dare defend my Birth: But e're your Justice lifts her fatal Hand To cut this Gordian of Dissolveless Love, To the Chaste Memory of it's purer Flame, Be in your conscious Heart this Truth recorded, That had the tender Izadora's Soul Not priz'd your Mind's dear Peace beyond her own, This cruel Rage, that now destroys our Hopes, Had in dispenceless Oaths been bound to crown 'em. Bla. O my Soul's Joy! My pious Izadora! [Embracing her. Iza. My Father still, and still belov'd as ever. Bla. Which way shall my Indulgence thank thy Love's So dear Concern for my endanger'd Honour? Iza. O! Ask not that dire Question of my Fears, Unless your conquer'd Passion cou'd, like mine Subdu'd, resolve to answer its Engagements. Bla. O Bleeding Conflict of resisted Nature; O Godlike Youth! [Throwing himself at Perolla's Feet. I bend me Blushing to the Earth, I sink, I burn with Red Confusion at my Shame; For I confess thou not deserv'st my Hate; But there's a Bar in my fierce Nature's Pride, An inborn Horror of Pacuvius Blood, That will not be subdu'd in thy behalf: Therefore by all my Wrongs to thy apparent Merit, I now conjure thee rouze thy Generous Soul, And turn thy fruitless Love of me and mine Into the nobler Fire of blameless Scorn. Per. Now, by my hopes in Izadora's Truth, My Friendly Heart bleeds inward at your pain, And melts in pity of your erring Passion. [Raising him. Bla. O lend a Thought to my worn Age's Woe! Weigh but the vast Extreams of my Distress, And be thy self the Judge of my Misdoing: Speak I conjure thee from thy conscious Heart, Is't fit, that he, whose Father sought my Life, The Son of him that has betray'd the Cause Of Rome, and since has wrought my Brother's Death! Shou'd from my Hand receive my Daughter's Heart, And make by my enduring, such vile Crimes my own? Iza. Is't fit your wild Revenge shou'd Blind pursue The Guiltless, and the Friend of Rome? Bla. Shall Blacius be allied to an Assassin's Son? Iza. That Son, whose Sword oppos'd his Father's Crime! Bla. Mix with that Blood my Native Honour hates? Iza. The Generous Blood that stream'd in your defence! Per. Yet bows submissive to your full Revenge! Bla. O cruel Honour! that my Arm's refus'd The honest means to take it. How now! what means thy Breathless Haste? Enter a Servant. Serv. My Lord, your Pardon for this bold Intrusion! Passing just now by Lord Pacuvius Gate, I saw the Guards of Hannibal come forth, When strait an Officer o'ertook their speed, And told 'em, They must make a Moment's Halt, For that th'intended Search of Blacius House Was now referr'd to Lord Pacuvius Care. Bla. What can this mean? Art sure thou'rt not deceiv'd? Ser. I'm sure, my Lord, and as they march'd along I heard one smiling to his Comrade say, Pacuvius were a Friend indeed, if to The Cause of Carthage he cou'd force his Son. More I had heard, but that I thought my haste Might better serve you by this timely notice. Bla. I thank thy Care: Bar fast the Gates, to gain If possible a Moment 'fore their Entrance. But on your Lives resist 'em notâaway. [Ex. Serv. And now, Perolla, thou shalt seeâ Per. That your Revenge has found at last The fated Ruine of my Fortune, and My LoveâThis search I know is made for me. Iza. O lost Perolla! O for pity yet My dearest Fatherâ Bla. Yes! yes! my Daughter now again I'm free, My painful Honour is at last reliev'd, He sav'd my Life, and I in double Thanks Return him his: For he defending mine, Found his Reward; but I now saving his, Foreknow that I may meet my Punishment. Fierce Hannibal be sure will full Resent The dar'd Concealment of his greatest Foe; But yet to let thee see my Honour scorns, Tho' on the Man I hate a base Revenge, This way lies thy Safety; what Horses or What Servants for thy Flight are requisite, Freely command, and thank me in thy speed. Iza. Must he then go despairing of your Friendship? Bla. Ungrateful Girl! Does not thy Lover's Life Reward thee well for my prevented Oath? Nay, if thou'rt fond to meet thy Ruine, stay, [To Perolla. A Life for Life is all thou canst implore, But never think of Izadora more. Per. Recall that Thought, or Life's not worth receiving, If Death's my Doom, here wou'd I choose to meet it. [Kneeling to Iza. Iza. O yet Perolla save thy latest Hopes, By all th'Endearments of our Friendship past, I do conjure thee fly, and ease my Fears, My Obligations yet are unreturn'd, And I must have thee live for Rome, And Izadora's Peace, Use not a Wish In a Reply: But haste, while yet the Gods can save thee. Per. Who wou'd not trembling fear his Death, When Beauteous Izadora wou'd preserve him? Supported in that Thought, I fly my Fate, To save my hopes of conquering Blacius Hate. [Ex. Per. Bla. You Izadora now retire, I wou'd Alone receive Pacuvius. Iza. The Gods Defend my Father, and the Friends of Rome. [Ex. Iza. Bla. At length my anxious Honour is reliev'd, The Combat now with Justice is determin'd, And o'er Pacuvius Blood I'm still Victoriousâsoft! He comes in Smiles to meet his Disappointment. Enter Pacuvius. Pac. So Blacius! Thou seest at last I've deign'd to visit thee. Bla. My Pride too is in part abated: For I own thou never cou'dst to me arrive More welcome. Pac. âIf thy Life's so burthensome, Perhaps from ancient Friendship I may yet Think fit to make thee bear it longer. Bla. When Hannibal shall know (as I be sure Will soon inform him) that thy Fears In private Spite have dar'd t'assassin those, Whom he's firm bound in Honour to protect, Thy feeble Power of Life or Death from him Deriv'd, thy weakest Foes secure may laugh at. Pac. Be not so joy'd to think thou'st scap'd my Hand. Bla. There must be Joy, where there's such sweet Revenge; For know yet more to gall thy fester'd Soul, Thy own lov'd Son Perolla was the Man, Whose friendly Sword preserv'd thy mortal Foe, And laid thy bleeding Malice at my Feet. Pac. This News is staleâand the sharp Pang it gave me's past. He knew thee not, and therefore I forgive him: But thou, I hear, as Ignorant of him, To thy own Mansion brought'st him Bleeding home; And wer't in that, 'tis more than probable, Thy self the Pandar to thy Daughter's Flame. Bla. 'Tis false. For when I knew his hateful Name, he found That Scorn reviv'd which to his Blood was due; But when I heard his Services to me Had stirr'd thy Fury to pursue his Life, I wav'd a while my prudent Hate to him, And let him scape to disappoint Pacuvius. Pac. Poor shallow-sighted Man! Pacuvius thanks thy Care; For I wou'd have him live when thou art dead, (Which soon will be) to keep thy restless Ghost In wakeful Terrors of thy Daughter's Honour: Mean while (for thy slow Brain, I see, divines Not yet the Cause that brought me hither) Guards, Appear. 'Twas not Perolla, but thy self [Enter Guards. I came to seize, and as a Traytor to the Trust Of Hannibal demand thee forth to Justice. Bla. Traytor's a Name that better fits Pacuvius Morals: Blacius scorns thy Slander. Pac. I know thou'rt proud; but we shall prove thee Traytor! This Letter from Rome's Consul shou'd have come To thee; 'tis better as it is: And now Whene'er his dreadful Army shall think fit T'approach Salapias Walls, I say again The Traytor Blacius Head upon the Brutian Gate Shall be the Signal of Pacuvius Arm'd to face 'em. Bla. O fatal Chance! Rome then and Blacius are no more! Tell my Daughter what has happen'd. [To his Servant. Pac. Now! Wretched Blacius! Art thou yet convinc'd Pacuvius has redeem'd his lost Revenge, And, wrought at last thy more assur'd Destruction? Bla. What Office do'st thou hold of Hannibal? For this to me seems so contemptible, It speaks the Spirit of Pacuvius lost. Pac. This Insolence I yet shall humble. Bla. Thou! thou tirest meâperform thy Office. Pac. Since thou'rt in hast for DeathâConduct him Guards. Thus hopeless by the Hand of Justice seiz'd, The hardest Traytors will affect a Smile. Bla. And Village Curs thus bay the Lion in the Toil. [Exeunt. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Fourth. The SCENE Continues. Enter Portius meeting Izadora. Port. Thou hapless Daughter of my dearest Friend, Hard-fated Offspring of my Sister's Love, Forgive this rude Intrusion on thy Griefs, That begs to join thee in a Kindred Woe: In thee, methinks, dead Martias Looks revive, Such were thy Mother's Youthful Charms, that Bloom, The same distressful Lustre in her Eyes, In such Heart-wounding Grace of Woe she mov'd, When the victorious happier Blacius then From dear-bought Conquest home return'd, in Tears Ran through the Battel past, and clos'd it with The mournful Story of her Father's Death. Iza. O fatal Omen! Is then Blacius dead? Port. Not dead, but dyingâdoom'd to dye! Iza. Heart-breaking Thought! Port. Fierce Hannibal, to make his Rage appear More the effect of Justice, than Revenge Against his Life in all the cruel Forms Of seeming Law proceeding has condemn'd him, Tho' the sole proof of his pretended Charge Was a late Letter from the Consul sent To Blacius, by Pacuvius intercepted: But where's the need of proof, when his vile Judges knew That Innocent or Guilty found of this, They for his Cordial Constancy to Rome Had pre-resolv'd his Death. Ev'n now I heard his Bloody Sentence given, Which e're the Morrow's Noon decrees him Dead, And (which the Fell Pacuvius mov'd) his Head Upon the Brutian Gate erected on a Spear to stand In vengeful Terror to the Friends of Rome. Iza. O Ruful Sound! O Deluge of Redundant Woe! O Blacius! Blacius! Where's now the pitying Hand that can Redeem thee? Port. Can we not start a Thought to his relief? Iza. Alas I fear 'tis now too late: But yet (For I too well foresaw what since has fall'n) Last Night, when first my moderated Tears Wou'd give my ebbing Reason leave to flow, By a near Friend, a Letter I dispatch'd To brave Perolla in the Roman Camp, In hope t'avert my wretched Father's Fate, Tho' what it begs I fear's too late propos'd. Port. But is there yet no Answer to these Hopes? Iza. None yet's arriv'd, which makes me now despair. Port. Have you inform'd my Brother of this Letter? Iza. Alas! I durst not yet, lest it Shou'd more incense his disappointed Rage Against my vain Assurance in Perolla. Enter a Page to Izadora. Pag. Madam, the Messenger, whom you last Night Dispatch'd, is just return'd, and brings you This. [Gives a Letter. Iza. My trembling Fears! Perolla's Hand. Port. Good News! Dear Fortune! Iza. Quick let me Read, it can't be worse to know Now Portius! For our Hope's Relief or Ruine! (Reads) âFor Blacius as the Cordial Friend of Rome, âI've gain'd o'th'Consul your propos'd Relief. O joyful Tidings! âBut as I knew him Izadora's Father, âI thought my Friendship was but half perform'd, âTill I had farther begg'd to be my self âThe sole Commission'd Envoy in his Cause. Generous Perolla! Port. A Friend indeed? Iza. âThis first Advice not long will reach you, e're âYou'll hear Perolla is arriv'd to ask âOf Hannibal his Audience, and Dispatch. Yes, cruel Father, now my Heart grows bold, Now I wish Courage can reproach that Rage That cou'd so ill repay thy wrong'd Preserver's Love. Port. What in this Juncture can my Care perform To help my Brother's Fortune? Iza. To Lord Pacuvius House, where Hannibal Resides, instant repair to meet Perolla: Your Entrance on th'Occasion will be free To hear his Audience, and their whole Debate, While I to my afflicted Father fly To raise his sinking Spirits from despair. Port. I'm gone, and hope t'oretake you soon With his confirm'd Relief.â [Exit Portius. Iza. O Godlike Youth! O truly great Perolla! Who tho' my cruel Father's Hate to thee Had render'd thy Neglect of him too just, Yet in this second Service to forget that Wrong, Has so Excus'd, my endless Gratitude to thee, That what his Passion late miscall'd my Disobedience, His Reason must at last confess my Virtue.â [Exit. The SCENE Opening, Discovers Hannibal on a Chair of State giving Audience to Perolla; Pacuvius, Portius, and Others attending. Han. Renown'd Perolla! 'Tis with Grief we see Such early Virtue erring in its Sword: Methinks th'Example of thy Father's Care, Whose early Application to our Friendship Has wisely sav'd his Fortunes from our Spoil, Might better have instructed thee to act, Than blindly thus to hold thee in a Cause, Whom neither Gods befriend, nor Arms can save. Per. My Lord, great Hannibal, Admit what but your Hopes suppose were true, Can Honour find my Virtue an excuse To leave my Country for its sinking Cause? Which most distress'd then most commands my Sword. Han. When Pleading Nature, or when Filial Love, Bespeak you to regard a Parent's Peace, Th'Excuse were not so difficult to find. Per. I wou'd be just to both, and hope I am; I love my Country, I revere my Father; And while I bleed for Rome,âI weep for him. Han. Yet draw your Sword, resolv'd against his Cause. Per. I cannot leave my Country, if I wou'd, 'Tis to forsake my self, or to suppose me born But for my self, and not in general Good Of my defended Fellow-Creatures Lives: Creatures Irrational, the Birds, the Beasts, For common safety flock and herd together; Wou'd it not start ev'n Nature to behold The homebred Dove forsake her fruitful Nest, And fetch the Vulture to destroy her Young? The Horned Ram t'oreleap the Ev'ning Fold, And call the Wolf to prey upon his Kind? Such seems to me the startling Horror of Forsaking Rome: I know not if I err: My Father sent me early to the War, Perhaps but half instructed in the World: For if for Interest, for Fear, or Love, A Man, unsham'd, may leave his Country's Cause, 'Tis, I confess, a depth in Politicks, His eager Fondness never taught my Youth. Han. Now then be better to thy Good inform'd, Our Friendship to thy Father's Merit has Inclin'd our Mercy to preserve his Son: Thy Terms, Perolla, shall be Honourable, Rewards far Nobler than thy Sword can gain, If thou'lt in time embrace our Cause, and not By vain Resistance make thy Ruine sure. Per. That's yet to know, or say 'twere known, so much I prize the Warlike Hannibal's Esteem, I'll not derive it from another but my self, Not my great Birth, but Virtue shall deserve it: For Rome succesless, as she seems, shall find Sh'as then a faster Friend of firm Perolla. In all our Camp there's not a Roman Heart, But thinks his single Sword a better Guard Than the best proffer'd Mercy of our Foes: But that my Vanity no longer may Seem pleas'd to see you court my Sword in vain, To all your Greatness has or can propose, This is the final Answer I shall make: That Death's not half so terrible to me, As Life in Friendship with the Foes of Rome. Han. Since to our proffer'd Mercy thou'rt so deaf, I've said; and leave thee to thy Fate deserv'd. Pac. (Aside) O! that Revenge without a Pang wou'd let Me love the stubborn Virtue of this Boy! Han. Nor Hope, when soon thy Ruine falls, that then Thy Birth or thy Submission shall arrest [Turning short to Perolla. The vengeful Fury of our Sword defy'd. Proceed we now to the Affairs in hand, Discharge thee strait, we are prepar'd to hear What in the Consul's Name thou woud'st demand. [Takes his Chair, Per. Thus then From Fabius, Consul of the Roman Arms, To Hannibal his Martial Foe renown'd, Have I in fair Commission to propose: The Consul late inform'd, that Blacius Life On some pretence stands forfeit to those Laws, Which thy new started Arbitrary Force. Upon the Enslav'd Salapians has impos'd, Yet waves the Wrong, or Justice of his Cause, Presuming that thy Will condemns his Life, And from his grateful Sense of Blacius Virtues, Knowing his Faith to Rome has stirr'd thy Rage, To bribe thy Fury from the Brave in Chains, He yields thee offer'd for his Life preserv'd, Thrice fifty Libian Captives free restor'd, Which by the Morrow's dawn shall joyn thy Force, From their disgraceful, swordless Bonds redeem'd, New Arm'd for Battel to retrieve their Honour: This, if approv'd, shall now be ratify'd; If not, I'm farther bid to tell thee then, Such Mercy, as thou shew'st to Blacius Life, Will he thy Brother Asdrubal with all That now are Captive to his Arms afford; Who when this wrong'd Patrician bleeds, shall fall With him reveng'd, a mutual Sacrifice. Han. Tell the warm Consul, Hannibal presumes, That when his Rashness sent so bold a Message, He thought not sure of CannÃ¦'s fatal Field, Forgot the measur'd Rings from the dead Hands Of Roman Knights despoil'd sent thence to Carthage, Or had he ponder'd our Victorious Arms Near Fam'd Trebias Flood, or Thrasimene, At late Ticinum, or Salapia, now He'd known that Hannibal might smile when threatned. We'll give the Romans proof, that we our Laws Due Course and Execution more regard Than all the Threats of their presumptious Arms: Nor if we fear'd cou'd we those Lives deplore, Who being Captives will deserve their Fate: For Blacius Death, it stands irrevocable, Nor shou'd the Fate of Hannibal prevent it. My Lord, Pacuvius, give our Orders strait T'erect a Scaffold in th'Allarum place, On which, before the Morning Sun declines, The Traytor Blacius, as condemn'd, shall bleed: For thee, Perolla, four Hours are thy Time allow'd For thy Departure to the Roman Camp; And those expiring, thy Protection ends, Found in Salapia then we treat thee as The Foe of Carthage, and the Spy of Rome. Thus tell the flatter'd Consul we resolve: And so farewelâ [Exit Hannibal and his Officers. Per. I've yet a Life which can't be better lost, Than in the Cause of Rome and Izadora. âIt shall be soâand Hannibal may yet Repent those Hours allow'd me for my stay. [Aside. My Friends, before we leave Salapia, I [To his Followers. Shall want your ablest Counsel, and your Courage. Pacuvius Returns. Pac. (Apart ...) I know not whyâbut cannot part, methinks, Till, as I ought, I've shewn this wilful Boy My glad Resentment of his Hope's Defeat. (... Apart) Per. But softâmy Father! Pac. Now violent Perolla, art thou yet Convinc'd, the Gods assert Pacuvius Cause? Blacius my hateful Foe, thou seest at last Not all thy disobedient Friendship cou'd Preserve: His Life now bleeds within the Law, And with the Morn expiring, gluts my full Revenge. Per. The Gods, that gave me Sense of Right or Wrong, Gave me my Virtue to abide my Choice; And Virtue tells me, They alone shou'd fear, Who know the wilful Errors of their Hearts; But there's a Native Courage in the Life Of Innocence, that never knows Despair. Pac. Know then, at once to crush thy Hopes for ever, This Moment I from Hannibal receiv'd Repeated Orders for curs'd Blacius Death, For which my self am going now to bar Him close, and bid his ebbing Hours prepare. Per. And can you think, while he's of Roman Blood, But it must fill his Heart with Pride, and Joy To hear you bring the News, that tells him of His own full Glory, and his Foes Dishonour! Pac. Honour from thee! Thou Son of Blacius! [In Passion. Per. Of lost Pacuvius, and deserted Rome! [Tenderly. Pac. Remember Izadora! Per. Carthage! Pac. Izadora! Per. Rome! Dishonour! Pac. Love! Per. Forsaken Rome! Pac. Revenge! Revenge! [Exeunt severally. Blacius in Prison, and Izadora. Bla. Why wilt thou still on this ungrateful Theme Pursue my latest Hours with new Disquiet? Iza. Is it such Pain to lose your Hate for one That has to such Extreams deserv'd your Love? O! Hard Severity! Is what your own Instructions have advanc'd In my Observance urg'd to my Reproach? That I'm a little Grateful, where so far oblig'd? Oft have you said, 'Twas Honour rul'd your Hate, Still be that sacred Principle obey'd, And Honour now as full demands your Love, Such Obligations, and such Friendship prov'd, 'Tis now impossible your Hate can slight Without that Stain, which most I know you loath, The hateful Stain of scorn'd Ingratitude. Bla. Fond Thoughtless Girl! Have I Not giv'n him, for my Life preserv'd, his Life! And for this second Service, which thou boast'st What is it more-than Honour binds him to? Am I not Fetter'd in the Cause of Rome? Which he (in Care of me) but justly serves, His Country serv'd is Service to himself. Had he Not come my Advocate for Life, The Generous Consul still some other wou'd Have sent more welcome to my grateful Thoughts: Now, on my Soul, I rather think in him, To ask the Office seems the close Result Of Brooding Malice, and Insulting Pride, He knew my Temper was not to be mov'd By ought his Soul was capable to act, And therefore thought this Glare of Friendship wou'd, If slighted, sink me in the World's Esteem, And so revenge him on my honest Scorn: But he shall find, ev'n in these humble Chains, My Mind's yet free, nor bends to tame Dishonour: While I have Sense, I still with Pride shall shew My Hate to curs'd Pacuvius Blood, which never shall But with my last Breath'd Life expire. Enter Pacuvius, with the Provost. Pac. Why then, before the Morrow's friendly Noon, Expiring Blacius is no more my Foe! Iza. Some Guardian God protect my Father! Pac. I come to take of thee my last Triumphant Leave: Thy Hope in vain, Perolla's Friendship's lost, This Moment Hannibal has warn'd him hence With fruitless Labour for thy Life's Reprieve, And to compleat thy Woes, Pacuvius comes With prosperous Power to warn thee to thy Fate. Iza. Support me Heav'n! Bla. âWhy then, Farewel, Pacuvius! Nor cou'd my Fate more please my parting Soul, Than to conceive how dear thy Hate to me Has cost thee in thy Fame: Thy Honour lost, Thy Native Country's Weal betray'd, have made Thy Vengeance mine, in thee abhorr'd to Ages; My Triumph's Purchas'd with Inferiour Blame, I've held my Hate, and yet preserv'd my Fame. [Ex. Bla. with the Prov. Iza. O! Whither is my wretched Father born? If to devouring Death, support me to His Aged Arms, to bathe his Bosom with My latest Tears, and with his Hopes expire. Pac. You cannot passâlet me survey thee fullâ Art thou the flatter'd Beauty, that presumes With subtile Arts t'enslave the stubborn Son Of wrong'd Pacuvius, and debase his Blood? Iza. Not so: Tho' I'm that wretched Maid forlorn, Whose long obedient Hate to you and yours, The forceful Virtues of Perolla have Dissolv'd: I cou'd not with relentless Eyes Behold his Passion, and his-Faith to Rome; Tho' less the Lover than the Hero mov'd me. O! had our jarring Parents feud not been To the last Sense of Nature deaf: Their Hate Like ours subdu'd had made lost Rome Victorious, Their Children happy, and their Fames immortal. But that remorseless Fury now has plung'd us all In one Inevitable Ruine: Blacius dies, The bleeding Heart of Izadora's broke: Perolla, hopeless in the Cause of Rome, Resign'd to Sorrow, drags a wretched Being, And lost Pacuvius, if he's Human, must despair. Pac. Despair's a Passion, that such Love-sick Minds As thine in Disappointments only feel; Weak Souls, that from their Fears are Slaves to Virtue, Pacuvius Heart is warm'd by Nobler Fire, And owns no Passion but untam'd Revenge; Revenge insatiate to curs'd Blacius Blood; A Rage, that now demands thy Vows revok'd From lost Perolla's vile deluded Love, Give me this Instant back his Recreant Heart, Or to thy own receive our Shame reveng'd. [Offering a Dagger. Iza. Strike home, and stamp me with Immortal Fame, To die in proof of Vows preserv'd to him, Of Faith unshaken to Perolla's Love, Adds unexpected Glory to my Death: Yet when this mortal Blow is given, your Arm Must strike again to reach me in Perolla's Heart, Ev'n after Death, I there shall haunt you still, And in his pining Griefs insult your Peace. Pac. I thank thee, Sorceress, for that hateful Thought, Which fires me now to an improv'd Revenge. I see thy Soul from young Perolla has Been taught unmov'd to meet the Frowns of Death: I'll therefore try if Smiles can stir thy Fears; My smooth Revenge now wears a softer Look, And more t'exert my Hate has put on Love: Receiv'd or slighted, by consent or force, Enjoy'd alike, my End is serv'd: I know That either spoils thee for Perolla's Taste; So take thy choice, on one I am determin'd. Iza. You cannot mean so horrible a Thought! Pac. And why so Horrible? Thou hast confest The Son belov'd, why not as well the Father? Perolla's but the Stream that flows from me, And I the Fountain's Head of thy Desire. Iza. If you've a Human Soulâ Pac. None of thy Sex's little Arts to me, I fathom all your shallow Wiles, and know You'll use Resistance to be more desir'd. But such Attempts on me are vain: Thy Beauty Adds not one Spark to my inflam'd Desire, I'll taste thy Sweets, and yet despise 'em too: For hadst thou all thy Sex's Charms, yet know My Rapture's not from Love, but sweet Revenge wou'd flow. Provost, (Within) What ho! my Lord! Pacuvius! help! Enter Provost Bleeding. Pac. Audacious Slave! Is this a time t'intrude? Begone, orâ Prov. âO! my Lord! we're lost! undone! Some Africans Disguis'd have seiz'd the Prison; Forc'd ope' the Dungeon, where doom'd Blacius lay, His Fetters loos'd, and arm'd him to escape; My self disputing to resign the Keys, Receiv'd this ghastly Wound, and fled to warn you. Pac. Confusion! O my lost Revenge! Iza. O double Joy! O my transported Hopes! Pac. Say Slave, are none allarm'd t'oppose 'em? Prov. None but our menial Servants were at hand: For they, before they enter'd, had secur'd The Centinels; the rest surpriz'd, They, desperate, drive before 'em. Pac. Ha! They're here? Enter Perolla, and others in African Habits mask'd, driving several before them. Pacuvius draws, and presents his Point to Blacius. Hold Traytor! yet there is a Sword to reach thee. Bla. Fortune, I thank thee now! Thou giv'st at least A Chance for my Revenge. [While they fight, Iza. kneels. Iza. Immortal Jove! to thee I bend for Aid, Be now the Stayer once again, again The dire Avenger of the Roman Causeâ My Prayers are heard, and Blacius has prevail'd. [Blacius closes with Pacuvius, and gets him down. Bla. Now Traytor! Have the Gods o'erta'en thee? Blacius offers to stab him, and Perolla returning, interposes. Per. Hold! hold! Disarm but Hurt him not: Your Life Preserv'd is all we sought, and that's secure. Bla. You, Sir, have Title to command me. Per. My Friends, this Lady too must be our Care, 'Tis now no time to talk: Bar fast the Doors On those that are within, that none may scape T'allarm the GuardsâCome, Sir, here lies our Way. Bla. Such Actions are above the reach of Thanks. Iza. The Bounteous Gods reward 'em. [Exeunt all but Pac. Pac. The horrid Furies from Remorseless Hell Revenge it on the curs'd Conspirer's Head! Why do I bear this Burthen of a Life, That weighs me down with Disappointments? No Means! No Thought! that can redeem my Hopes! Dull Brain! not to pursue 'em all this while; They cannot far be fled, I yet may forth [Goes to the Door. T'allarm the Streets, and overtake their Flight! [Finds it barr'd. Confusion! Bolted! Barr'd again to my Despair! My Foe set free, and I his Prisoner! Help ho! Without there! Treason! Murther! No one hear! If I mistake not, yon dark Avenue leads Me to an open CourtâCall there aloud! This is no time for Thought but Execution. [Ex. Pac. The SCENE Changes to Portius his House. Enter Portius, Perolla still Disguis'd, Blacius and Izadora. Port. My Brother from his Chains redeem'd: By what Strange Turn of Fate is our Despair reliev'd? Bla. O Portius! Here! see here's the Arm that sav'd me. Port. Such Obligations, and conceal'd, create my Wonder. Per. Here, Sir, my Service endsâyou now are free: But for the farther Means of your Escape, I must commend it to Lord Portius Care, You'll pardon, Sir, my haste to leave you here, Since my own Safety and my Friend's require Our speedy Flight, and change of our Disguises. Bla. Hold, Sir! the Pleasure of my Freedom's lost, Not knowing whom to thank for my Deliverance. Per. Not to disturb that Pleasure, I must still Conceal my Name: But if you will suppose Your Freedom worth a grateful Thought: Then there 'Tis due! To Izadora's Filial Love, Whose Piety alone engag'd me to attempt it. And my Reward is paid in Thanks from her. Your Pardon, and your Leaveâ [Ex. Perolla. Bla. So Blunt a Virtue never have I seen! He own'd himself to thee reveal'd my Daughter, On thy Obedience I conjure thee speak; Be just to his Desert, and let me know him; Be just to me, and point me to be Grateful. Iza. You heard my Father, he but ask'd my Thanks; Leave then to me your Care of Gratitude: Remember once Perolla sav'd your Life; But when discover'd, what was his Reward? Bla. His Action ought not to be nam'd, compar'd Perolla, but by chance preserv'd a Stranger; But this design'd to save the Life of Blacius. Iza. And whom cou'd Izadora most engage To save it?â [Weeping. Bla. Ha! my Daughter! O! I find thy Fears! Well might'st thou warn me from my curious Search, A Thousand Recollected Thoughts convince Me now, it must, it can be only he; Pacuvius Life defended, speaks him Plain, Nay, spite of my Aversion, speaks him Great; If it be so, if thou confirm'st it Him, If 'tis Perolla, then indeed the Soul Of vain Resisting Blacius is subdu'd, By his Victorious Virtues bound a Slave, And now must kneel to him in shame for Pardon. [Iza. kneels weeping. Alas! thou need'st not speak! thy flowing Eyes Too tenderly confess thy modest Joy! My Izadora! O! I cannot bear my Thoughts! I see thy Passion now so greatly Just, So justly Grateful to Perolla's Love, I burn with Blushes, that I've stood so long Unmov'd against his Cordial Obligations; Nay, I will flatter yet my pride of thee, And fancy thy Inspiring Virtues taught Him first to reach this Greatness of the Soul. Iza. O! my kind Father! till he'd conquer'd you, I knew not that Perolla had so far Engag'd my Heart: I only thought before 'Twas Gratitude: But now (if 'tis a Fault, O yet forgive it! for) I own 'tis Love. Enter a Servant. Ser. Fly! fly, my Lords, if possible, and save your Lives! The Guards of Hannibal surround the House, And he himself's this Moment upon Entrance. Port. O horror to our Hopes! Iza. Distressful Woe! Port. No thought to save us? Bla. NoneâFor see our Fate approaches. Enter Hannibal, Pacuvius, and Guards. Provost. Han. So, Sir, you yet are in the reach of Justice. Bla. Changes of Fortune are to me so frequent, Now nothing gives me Fear or Wonder. I know my Fate, and I expect it. Han. And thou shalt meet it with the Rising Morn: Let Portius too be seiz'd, whose dar'd attempt To hide a Traytor, by the Law condemn'd, Shall make him now the Partner of his Fate. Bla. My Brother's Blood! that strikes indeed! Han. The Maid is innocent, and therefore free, For these conduct 'em to their Doom deserv'd. Iza. O miserable Fortune!â [Ex. Bla. Port. Iza. and Guards. Han. My Lord, Pacuvius, these vile Traytors Lives Are scanty Vengeance for insulted Justice: Our chiefest Foe i'th'open Face of our Authority redeem'd, our Arms disgrac'd, A Traytor on the Eve of Execution In our Head Quarters freed by force from Justice, More stirs my Rage, than all vile Blacius Crimes, And we're obliged with double Vengeance to Resent it. Pac. What if your Orders on the Instant shou'd Proclaim to those, that shall discover strait Th'Audacious Hands, that set this Traytor free, Rewards unlimited, some tempting Bribes, That Honour, Love, nor Friendship can resist. Han. Thou'st warm'd my Thoughts: Be it immediate done, And the Reward, whatever shall be ask'd Of Hannibal, within his power to grant. For Traytors in the strongest state conceal'd, Like unforeseen Distempers in the Blood, May bring the healthiest Body to the Grave; Therefore we never can too dearly buy The Knowledge of a secret Enemy. [Exeunt. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT the Fifth. Blacius, and Portius in Prison: Portius Sleeping. Bla. The Morning rises with its usual Ray, Nor shews the Gloomy Face of least Disorder: No Prodigies, no Fate-foretelling Stars; Nor Storms, nor Thunders wait on Blacius Death: In every thing the Course of Nature still Keeps duly on, concernless in its Road, And will do still the same, when I'm no more: Why shou'd I think it then a Pain to leave These common Objects, that regard not me? Behold! how Peacefully a constant Mind [Observing Port. Receives the solemn Summons of its Fate? And in the Body's Rest discards the Thought? To dye's no more: Our Sleep's a short-liv'd Death, Either is but the loss of Time unknown; And he that sleeps, till from the Grave awak'd, Feels not that Gap in his Eternity, T'exceed a Moment!âSoft! he wakes! But Oh! to sleep again in Death for me! O Portius! if thy wandring Soul has dreamt Of Liberty, how mournful is this Waking? Port. Not so, my Brother, tho' I've dreamt, 'tis true, Nay dreamt, that our amazing Fortune had Preserv'd us both, and tho' my Reason waking Presents me not a distant Hope to save us, The lively Image still so fills my Mind, I can't yet leave it for a Thought of Sorrow. Bla. O! that I thus cou'd form a Hope for thee! But when I think that my Misfortunes have Involv'd thy Fate, that my dear Brother's Blood Must stream for his unhappy Faith to me; 'Tis more than all my Manhood can support! O Portius! pity, and forgive my Fate. Port. Art thou to Blame for what thy Fate has done? O Blacius! I cou'd call thee now Unkind, To think my Death's not more a Pleasure than a Pain. Has not our Friendship yet from forward Youth To lagging Age ran through divided Pleasures? And shall thy Heart not share me in Distress? Shall I now coldly mourn, because I bleed, In proof but of a friendly Faith to thee? Now, on my Soul, I know thy honest Heart With pleasure wou'd abide its Fate for Portius; Can then a Friendship, so sincerely bound, Suppose a happier End, than dying thus together? [Embracing. Enter the Provost, and Guards. Pro. My Lord, your Pardon for Unwelcome News: By Orders now from Hannibal receiv'd I am directed to remove you hence To your immediate Execution: But, Lord Portius, you have found his Mercy. Bla. What said'st thou, ha! Pro. Great Hannibal inform'd, On cooler Thoughts, that your unhappy Crime Was more an ancient Friend's Concern for Blacius, Than wilful Scorn of his insulted Power, Extends his Mercy to your Life's Reprieve. Bla. Then welcome Death! and since my Brother's free, I die without a murmuring Thought to Fate. Port. O Blacius! can I taste such ill divided Mercy? Pro. Your mournful Daughter with successful Tears Implor'd his Mercy for a Father's Life, But all her piteous Piety cou'd gain Was his hard Leave before your Death to take A parting Blessing, and her last Farewel. Port. See where she comes, adorn'd in Sorrow. Enter Izadora. Death ne'r look'd Terrible till now. Bla. These Tears, my Izadora, wound me more Than all the Weapons of approaching Death: But that I see it strikes so hard upon Thy tender Heart, to me the Thought were nothing; Why shou'dst thou thus disturb thee at a stroke, Which he that's now most happy's sure to feel? When first we're launch'd on this uncertain World, Our earliest Knowledge tells us we must drown, Nature assures us nothing in the Voyage, But that she, soon or late, will call us strict To our Account of this intrusted Venture: The Time is come to make her due demand On me and 'tis but fit that it were paid. Iza. But then to enter on your Life distrain'd To seize it in a Bloody Execution; This is not Nature's Law, but Fortune's Tyranny; The Debt of Nature might be easier paid! But now to die! your Health, your Senses sound! Your Strength yet fresh, and capable to run (No Violence us'd) with Vigour to the Goal; Howe'er your tender Love's Concern for me With Manly Courage may disguise the Terror, I know 'tis more than Nature can support! This weaker Frame in spight of you must start, And shudder at so sharp a Dissolution. Bla. In vain I see weak Reason has prescrib'd Us Virtue, as the Armour of our Hearts: For Oh! to part with thee, my Izadora! To lose the Cordial Comforts of thy Youth, Th'endearing Softness of that Filial Love, Whose cheerful Smiles so oft have sooth'd my Age, In spite of Resolution wounds me through; To leave thee thus! to this vile World expos'd, An helpless Orphan, destitute of Friends, Amidst the Hazards of outragious Fortune! O! where's that temper'd Heart of hardest Virtue, That can unshock'd withstand the bruising Blow? Iza. Nay, now you double my DistressâBut yet One parting Comfort's left to your support, And let th'Assurance sooth your dying Thoughts, That tho' you leave me to the World forlorn, The same unshaken Virtue, that has still Preserv'd me taintless in my Actions past, Shall, when the dear Protector of my Youth Is dead, support me to the last like Blacius Daughter. Bla. O! let me press thee to my Heart reviv'd, And thank thy Virtue for this ease in Death! Portius!âmy Brotherâand my FriendâFarewelâ I see thy Heart is fullâand will Not overcharge it with thy Griefs increas'd! âOnly this Boonâmy Izadora's Youthâ Let me bequeath to thy protecting Careâ âMy Izadora!âO! the killing Thought!â This last embraceâThy dying Father's Blessingâ âOne Farewel KissâO! must we part for ever! Pro. My Lord, the Time elapses. Bla. But one short Word, and I have done. And now by all our faithful Friendship past, (Observe me well, for 'tis my last Request) Let me conjure thee, Portius, when the time Of decent Sorrow for a Father's Death, In mournful Izadora's ceasing Tears, Shall be expir'd, to crown her Virgin Wishes, Give her, where most her Beauties are deserv'd, Where most her Heart inclinesâto brave Perolla, And as you wish the Grave shou'd yield me Rest, Reward her Virtues with her Love possest. [Ex. severally. The SCENE Opening; Discovers a Scaffold for the Execution of Blacius, and at some distance a Seat rais'd for Hannibal; Guards and People crowding; Pacuvius speaking to an Officer. Pac. Now Captain, let the Soldiers close their Ranks, And on this side the Scaffold no one pass, Till Hannibal himself shall take his stand: For he in Person is resolv'd to see The Execution of the Law perform'd, And by his awful Presence to prevent Th'audacious Thought of any second Tumult. And see his Guards approach us! (Within) Bear back, make way there! Enter Hannibal attended. Han. Good Morning to the Lord Pacuvius! What! Are all things ready? is the Prisoner come? Pac. I sent just now your Orders to produce him. Han. 'Tis well, and has our Edict been proclaim'd? Pac. Already twice the publick Officer This Morn proclaim'd it in the Forum, And through the City several Copies are Dispers'd, in hopes to make it more effectual. Han. (To the Crowd) My Friends, what you have heard proclaim'd, we here Prepar'd stand forth in Person to confirm: Nay more! of these unlimited Conditions, To bind us firmer yet to the Performance, We solemn vow before th'Attesting Powers, By the full Glory of our Conquering Arms, And by our Father's dear departed Soul, Without reserve most faithfully to keep 'em. People. Huzzah! Han. But see the Prisoner comes to give our Laws their due. Pac. And me my last Revenge. Enter Blacius, Provost, and Guards. Bla. What Ceremony's next? Pro. No more, my Lord, but to ascend the Scaffold. Bla. Conduct me. Han. âHold! Yet stay thee, Blacius, e're the lifted Sword Of final Justice falls upon thy Life, If ought thou know'st, that may arrest its Arm Now open to the publick Ear, declare it, That Men may say, thou either ow'st thy Life To our Impartial Honour, or thy Death To what thy guilty Silence has confest. Bla. Since what I undertook for injur'd Rome Has fail'd my Hopes, Life now were scarce a Favour: I am prepar'd to die, and therefore shall be short: How far my Doom is just, is bootless to Inquire; No, prosperous Hannibal, I'll not complain Of Wrongs receiv'd, where thy dire Will's a Law; Yet if thou'dst have the World suppose my Death Not whole is owing to thy deaf Revenge, I have a late Request to ask thy Power, Which cannot taint thy Honour to comply with. Han. To let thee see we deal Compassion with Our Justice, free demand. Bla. Thus then, I have an only Child, whose Filial Love Late brought her to Salapia, lost, to mourn Her hapless Father's Chains, and sooth his Sorrows. Now let me beg of thy indulgent Honour, That since thy Mercy has been pleas'd To leave her yet one only Friend in Portius, That he, this Daughter, and some small Retinue, When I am dead, may freely be allow'd Your Convoy to the friendly Arms of Rome, With the Remains of his impair'd Estate, To end their Days in Inoffensive Quiet. Han. Our Power wou'd wound it self to strike the Innocent; The eldest Law of Greatness is Compassion: Thy mournful Daughter free shall be releas'd, And not alone thy Brother Portius Fortune, But (tho' the Law condemns the whole) yet half Thy own we grant to her Distress restor'd: Of which perform'd, our Honour be the Pledge. [Bla. bows, and wipes his Eyes. Pac. How easily to Honest Fools May Wise Men paint their Greatness? [Aside. Han. Now, is there ought that thou wou'dst farther say? Bla. No more, but that this Favour was Thy only way to draw the Tears of Blacius. Han. But that our Honour binds us to be just, Thou too shou'dst taste our Mercy: But the Trust That Carthage has repos'd in Hannibal Must, in despight of Nature, be discharg'd; 'Tis that alone, and not thy Foe, destroys thee; By that compell'd we yield thee to the Law, Conduct him to his Fate. [Bla. mounts the Scaffold. Pac. O well supported Virtue! Now will the Rabble think this real! [Aside. A Noise is heard among the Crowd, and at some Distance, Portius and Izadora. People. Make way! make way for the Lady there! Guards. Keep back! keep back! there's no one passes there. Iza. O yet for pity, Soldiers, let me pass! Han. How now! What means that rude Disorder? Pro. My Lord, a Lady by Lord Portius brought, Distress'd she seems, intreats with earnest Mood, Before the Execution's done, she may be heard; And comes to Hannibal, she says, for Justice. Han. Admit her: To Justice never has our Way been barr'd. [Han. descends, Iza. runs to him, and kneels. Iza. O Hannibal! for ever Fam'd in Arms, But truly Great in thy regards of Honour; By Honour, I conjure thee now, be just, And yet defer doom'd Blacius Execution, Whom by the hopes of my Eternal Peace I've something to reveal, that will compel Thy Honour to preserve or sink thy Fame for ever. Han. Beware, thee Woman, of thy flatter'd Hopes. The guilty Blacius Crimes too full are prov'd T'expect our Mercy from the highest Bribe Thy Tears can give, or ought thou canst reveal; Therefore to spare thy Tongue, that fruitless pain, Our Guards remove herâ Iza. âHold! Yet, cruel Warriour, hear me for thy Fame! I ask not Mercy, but thy Justice due; But yet a Moment, and I'm dumb for ever! If what I have to say is not of last Importance to preserve thy Oaths, thy Honour, If not by thy own Laws, proclaim'd my Right, Let loose thy fiercest Rage upon my Life; Give me the Tortures, lingring Pains, or worse, The dead denial of my Hope's Relief. Now, by that sacred Power that fills thy Soul, [Breaking from the Guards. By the resistless Force of conquering Honour, I must! I will be heard, or hold you ever! These Hands thus clinch'd no Force shall part, unless With cruel Swords you cut my Hold away. People. Hear her! hear her! Han. Forbear a while the Execution! Yet think not, Woman, that thy Tears prevail; But Honour, thus allarm'd descends to hear thee: Mean while from Hannibal thou'rt as secure Of Justice, as doom'd Blacius of his Fate; Than which what dreadful Oracles foretell, Not more assur'd, thou may'st depend on: Say then from whence, and what is thy demand? Iza. Behold me then, the wretched Blacius Daughter, Whose late Offences most unfortunate, So far it seems have stirr'd your fatal Rage, That nothing but his vital Blood can sate it. For when your Prison late was forc'd, and he To your Revenges Disappointment freed, Your warm Resentment in its Heat proclaim'd, That whosoever truly shou'd reveal The first Contriver, Causer, or Accomplice, Audaciously concern'd in his Redemption, Shou'd strait receive whatever Gift, Reward, or Boon, their utmost Wish cou'd ask, Or you your self had lawful Power to grant. Han. Ha! Iza. And now, pursuant to this Law proclaim'd, (Which here I offer as the Witness of My Right) I come with an undoubting Joy To name this vile Offender of your Law, And from your Honour bound to claim my just Reward. Han. Thou hast allarm'd me now indeed. Pac. Confusion! Iza. Which, that you may with less Reluctance grant, I will not only name, but instant yield The dire Offender now into your power, To slake the Thirst of your inflam'd Revenge. Han. Nay then, without a Pang, our Doubts reliev'd Dare yet assure thee of thy full Reward, Which by those solemn Vows, the publick Ear Can witness, we have taken to confirm Again, we swear without reserve to pay. Now then, be thou as quick in thy performance, Produce th'Offender, and receive thy Wishes. Iza. Behold then, here th'Offender stands! Your Prison forc'd was Izadora's Crime: And tho' my weaker Sex deny'd my Arm To execute so resolute a Deed, Yet my more daring Heart contriv'd the means By Prayers, and Letters to a Roman Youth, I wrought his Friendship to my Hopes distress'd, And with his generous Sword redeem'd my Father. Not but I pride me in the glorious Guilt, And stand prepar'd to meet my Punishment, Which, be it all your Fury can inflict, The dear Reward of my Discovery Will render light, as your Revenge on Blacius: For know, the Boon demanded of thy Justiceâ Han. Hold! Beware, I charge thee, in thy rash demand; And tho' thou'st caught my Honour in this Snare, Think not when that's discharg'd, if thou insult'st My Power, my tame Revenge shall sleep to thee: For by the Fury of our Rage defy'd, That moment thou but nam'st thy Father's Life, That wrethed Father shall himself, upon That Scaffold rais'd for him, behold thee bleed. Pac. Well urg'd again! then yet there may be hopes! [Aside. Han. Now make at thy own Peril thy demand, I've warn'd thee well, yet stand prepar'd to grant. Iza. Then yetâwhatever Death the All-just Gods Design for meâGive me the Life of Blacius! People. Huzzah! Justice! Justice! Huzzah! Han. Yes! yes! y'unthinking Herd! you shall have Justice, So too will Hannibal; your Holiday Not yet is lost: You shall have Blood to stare on, Tho' pleas'd to think your Favourite Blacius sav'd, Yet you shall see, since we forewarn'd her Fate, Before his Face this subtile Traytress bleed! âBind! bind her Handsâyet holdâfor now perhaps Convinc'd, that we have firm resolv'd thy Death, The Terror may dissuade thy rash demand. Iza. Weak Hannibal, who staggering thus thy self, Presum'st to measure by thy own Resolves The firmer Daring of a Roman Soul: Revenge be thine; Give me the Life of Blacius. Han. Provoking Virtue! in a Female Soul! Where have I liv'd, that never yet conceiv'd the Charm? The Charm indeed! 'tis Witchcraft! Spells! Inchantment! I feel my Virtue struggling in the Snare, And must destroy her to preserve my self! Away! the Sorceress! Hence! dispatch her! Haste, And rid me of this Hurry in my Blood! Quick, Slaves! while yet I have the Power to end her. As they lead Izadora to the Scaffold, Perolla breaks through the Guards to Hannibal. Per. Hold! hold, injurious Hannibal! nor let the Blood Of Innocence defame thy blind Revenge: Behold the Nobler Object of thy Rage, That makes it Justice, and instructs thy Fury, To bribe thy Mercy to that tender Maid! Behold Perolla, who provokes thy Vengeance! Whose Arm when free has been as much thy Terror, As now when bound in Chains 'twill be thy Safety; Whose Guardian Sword in the contested Field So oft has cut the hopes of thy Ambition, Which the Lucalians, Samnites, Cassilinum, Th'Appulians, and Petilia shall record to Ages: Who not alone content to gall thee, thus Victorious in the Field; but to thy Arms Disgrace, to thy Head Quarters came disguis'd, Ev'n in thy Army's Centre forc'd thy Prisons, Destroy'd thy Guards, and in thy Powers Contempt Restor'd the Freedom of thy Foe condemn'd. Han. Audacious Virtue! Per. Nay, and who now was come, Resolv'd (but that His pious Daughter had foredone my purpose) To stop like her the Fury of thy lost Revenge, (Unless thou dar'st to break thy Honour's Bonds) By my demanded Pardon for the Life of Blacius. Pac. Horror! Iza. O most untimely Virtue! Per. But since the Blood of Izadora is The Price decreed of thy extorting Mercyâ Iza. Hold! Oh! Hold, unkind PerollaâO! Glorious Hannibal! Yet e're the Rashness of his Virtue moves To supersede the Claim of Izadora, Permit me but to offer him a started Thought, And by the hopes of suffering Innocence, So far is what I ask from means t'oppose, That yet I swear to double your Revenge. Han. Such daring Spirits have I never seen; Thou hast our leave, propose thy Thought, and ease Me quick of this unactive Wonder. [Iza. seems to Argue with Perolla. Now! now, Pacuvius, help me in this strait Of tempted Honour, and oppos'd Revenge, Pac. Let my Example then inflame thy Soul! The lost Perolla, I perceive, as much Abhors your Person as your height of Glory; In that one Thought, he is no more my Son, No more am I his Father, but his Foe; Let then his Blood, offensive to us both, At once sate your Revenge and my Displeasure, There's Glory in so just a Sacrifice. Han. (Aside ...) Amazement still! Is't possible a Soul so weak with Spleen Can be the Sire of so much healthy Virtue? (... Aside) Per. My Death to save thee were a Pleasure: But, Iza, Can dying with me give thy Thoughts a pain? Per. O! that Inchanting Softness in thy Looks Prevails,âand yetâ'tis hard! Iza. For me, Perolla, To make our Virtue try'd Immortal, as our Love! Per. I cannot bear the painful Onset of Thy Eyes intreating! O! I yield! 'tis done! And thus I trust thy Virtue with my Fame! [Per. and Iza. kneel to Hannibal. Now truly Conquering Hannibal, behold, Submissive at thy Feet thy Foe subdu'd, Now asking Pardon of thy Pow'r defy'd: For I confess, 'twas pleasure to provoke thee, While I propos'd my Life resign'd might save The Innocent: But since our harder Fate Destroys us both by thy divided Mercyâ Iza. Since my vain Life, by great Perolla sav'd, Must leave my Father still expos'd to Death, And me in greater Torment from such Life acceptedâ Per. Since in our strictest Search of Fate, we find No hope of mutual or of parted Happiness, We now implore our Crimes to thee confest, May share the Glory and the Punishment. Iza. Since both are wretched, tho but one shou'd bleed: Per. We beg in Mercy bothâI cannot speak it. Iza. âBoth may die together. But for the joint Reward of our Discovery, Which we're compell'd in Duty to demand. Per. And thou'rt in honour as firm bound to pay. Iza. With an united Claimâ Both. We beg the Life of Blacius. Pac. Then perish both, and double your Revenge. Han. O weak Pacuvius! that canst think Revenge Consists in timely granting their Desires, The smart of Body is the Vulgar's Terror; That have no farther Hope than sensual Life, No Pain like Obligations to the Brave, Great Souls by Greater only are subdu'dâ Release the Prisoner, and conduct him hither. People. Huzzah! Pac. Vain Hannibal! are these a Statesman's Maxims? Han. Shall it be said by Time's succeeding Tongues, That Fortune set me up a Foe, whom Fear Advis'd me to secure, or that pale Envy Took shamefully the safe Advantage of His chanc'd Misfortunes to destroy him? No, The World shall see, that Hannibal in spite Of his ador'd Ambition dares be Great: First then to thee, Pacuvius, I restore That Son thy Friendship wou'd have sacrific'd, And to Perolla, as his Virtue's due, I give him to his Life his Liberty: To thee most wondrous Maidâ Pac. Yet hold! while I have cause to thank thee. Han. What I resolve shall thank it self. Pac. The Galling Thought! Han. To thee, bright Excellence, whose softer Charms Might look the rugged Lion to Compassion From a Superiour Claim, than what my Honour is Engag'd to pay thy most amazing Piety, To thee I yield the forfeit Life of Blacius. Iza. O Godlike Hannibal! [Bla. Iza. and Per. kneel. Han. âNo Thanks be paid, For Hannibal stands more obliged to you, On whose firm Virtues prov'd I raise my own: But lest your Thanks, refus'd shou'd give you pain, From thee, Perolla, I shall pleas'd receive 'em: Haste to the Field, and thank me with thy Sword; Rally thy scatter'd Legions, and oppose Me, bold in Arms, as thou hast dar'd for Love; Then when I meet thee most, my Glorious Foe, I'll call thee Vanquish'd, grateful to my Fame. Per. Instructed thus, I am inspir'd to Thank thee: This grateful Sword, in thy fierce Arms oppos'd, Shall tell the World what Dangers thou hast sought, What Hazards in this Mercy thou hast dar'd, To climb the Precipice of Martial Glory. Victor, or Vanquish'd, I'll record thy Fame. Pac. Now vain inglorious Hannibal! to think Thou canst conceal from the discerning World The Native Colour of this half-painted Virtue: Wou'dst thou ascribe to Thirst of Glory, what So gross we see proceeds from Abject Love? Not Conquering Izadora's Virtues, but Her Eyes Victorious have subdu'd thy Honour! Gods! Is then the Trust of Carthage thus discharg'd, By granting publick Mercy to her Foes? O shame to Arms! that Honour, Justice, Fame, Shou'd lose their Force for a vain Smile of a Woman? A Flame, which Health of Sense will never own, Like Madness when 'tis cur'd, it ever was possess'd with. Han. Injurious Man! whose rash unslak'd Revenge Wou'd stain a Soul, that soars above thy Slander. But to confirm the conscious World, and thee, That Hannibal disdains so base a Thought, Since Love has chang'd their Hearts, and grateful Blacius, As I am told, approves their mutual Fires, My Innocence thus joins their Hands for ever. Per. Now, on my Soul, this Virtue pains my Sense, My swelling Heart's oppress'd with Obligations. O Blacius! Portius! Izadora! Pac. Horror on Horror still! O! Rage of Pain! My Son insultant mingling with curs'd Blacius Blood! Have I for this abjur'd my Country's Cause? Despis'd the honest World's long held esteem; Sold my dear Fame, and cheated of the Price! Han. Let my Example teach thee Temper. Pac. Perish thy tame Philosophy! Low, as I am, my spiteful Stars shall see Not all their Malice cou'd subdue Pacuvius! And since my fatal Services to thee Are now at last Barbarian-like return'd With thy ungrateful Mercy to my Foe, And in my Blood debas'd my fierce Revenge insulted, That Life I only valu'd as a Plague to Blacius, Seeing him bless'd, 'tis time shou'd be no more. [Stabs himself. Han. O horrid Act! Per. My Father!â Iza. O dire Distraction! Pac. Since my sole Joy in Being was my spite, To Blacius Blood, 'twas then Relief to die, When 'twas in vain to hate him. [Dies. Han. Death only cou'd subdue so fierce a Passion. Look up, Perolla, and restrain thy Tears: Thy Honour and thy Love demand thy Care: At once to free thee then from farther Fears, This fair one, Blacius, Portius, and thy self, Shall have our leave immediate to depart; A Squadron strait of our Numidian Horse Shall be detatch'd your Convoy to the Consul. People. Huzzah! Bla. And now from this Day's strange Events we see By what small Accidents the Gods maintain Against Man's vain Presumption their Decrees: But hence an Hour, and the dire Sword was drawn, That shou'd have pierc'd the streaming Life of Blacius, While fierce Pacuvius in too warm pursuit Of his Revenge advis'd the means, that lost it, And he who came assur'd to glut his Eyes With vengeful Pleasure at the Tragedy, Now lies himself sole Actor in the Scene: And last to crown their unforeseen Resolves, That all things might in course of Justice move, Perolla's bless'd with Izadora's Love.
