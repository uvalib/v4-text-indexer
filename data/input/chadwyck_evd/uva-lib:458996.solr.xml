      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Enter at one dore Don Antonio leading Maria; at another two Gentlemen. 1. The Prince of Portugal, Don Antonioâ 2. He courts our Infanta close. 1. And may deserve her. Enter Don Manuel. Maria lets fall a Jewel from her dress, he takes it up, and offers it to her. Man. Your Graceâ Mar. 'Tis none of mine, Don Manuel. Will your Highness walk? Ex. Ant. &amp; Mar. 1. Observe you that? 2. The Prince seem'd not well pleas'd. Man. What doth the Princess mean? I saw it fall from her. 1. My eyes are witness, Noble Don Manuel. Man. My Lords, your servant. 2. How do you like the Spanish Court? Although My Lord your father were a native, yet Your birth and education were abroad; Compell'd by your father's destiny. Man. My unhappiness! I have heard him say, some policies prevail'd To make him leave this Kingdom, and his fortunes, To try his fate at sea, till he found means To plant himself in Portugal, from whence He was but late reduc'd by the good Prince, With promise of a pardon; and his honour Is full securitie for us. 1. The Prince Can do becoming things, and knows good acts Are in themselves rewards; but the report Was here, that fifteen thousand Ducats Were offer'd Roderigo our Kings brother, By your father Lord Piracquo, to assure His reconcilement here, for trespasses He did at sea. 2. But not accepted. I know not which will be his more vexation, To know the Prince's act, restore Piracquo, Or so much money lost. Enter Prince Carlo, and Celio his Page. 1. The Prince. Car. Don Manuel, You are become a man of mighty business, Or I have lost some interest, I had Since I left Portugal; but I'll not chide. Where is the King? 2. In his Bed chamber, Sir, With Duke Mendoza. Car. I'll not intterrupt 'em. You may redeem your error, and we both Converse again. Exit. Man. You infinitely honor, And with it bind the obedience of your creature. 1. Now he is going to his Mistris. 2. To Clara The Duke Mendoza's Daughter. Man. Mistris? do you forget, my Lord, the treaty, And his own personall contract, the kiss warm On Isabella's lip, and strengthned by the hope And expectation of another Mariage, Betwixt Anthonio and Maria his Sister? 1. We are us'd To freedom here, with as much innocence I may, perhaps, hereafter say, the Princess Maria meant you honor, when she dropt A Jewel; Sir, it cannot be much blemish For you to own her service. Man. 'Twere an insolence (Beyond her mercy to forgive) in me, To think she meant it grace, or I apply it At such a distance of my blood and fortune. This in a whisper, but convey'd through Court, Would forfeit me for ever: As y'are honourable, Preserve me in my humbler thoughts. 1. Be confident. 2. And pardon my expression; Sir, your servant. Exe. Man. I have observ'd the Princess scatter beams Upon me, and talk language with her eyes Sometime, such as I dare not apprehend With safety, or Religion; for I find My heart anothers conquest. But the Prince! Why should he move my jealousie? I know His amorous thoughts, already plac'd upon Fair Isabella, must inhabit there, And meet their just reward; he cannot be So carelesless of his honour. Enter Pedro. Ped. Can you direct-me, Sir, to Don Piracquo, Your noble father? I bring affairs concern him. Man. You wait upon the Duke Mendoza, Sir? Pe. I was i'th' first number of those attended His Dutchess, while she liv'd; his Grace doth now Acknowledge me a waiting movable Within his family; my name is Pedro, A poor kinsman of yours, if you be, Sir, My Lord Piracquo's son, and might have been His heir, had not you Mother been more fruitfull At sea, before she died, who left you an infant; 'Twas something to my prejudice, but your Fatherâ Ma. Is in the privy Garden, Sir. Pe. Your servant. Exit. Ma. What means this fellow to survay me? ha! Clara! Enter Mendoza and Clara. And her Father Duke Mendoza! I Must wish a time without his presence, to Confirm, how much I honour her: Loud fame Speaks him a noble Gentleman, but of late (By what misfortune 'tis not known) he hath Some garbs, that shew not a clear spirit in him. But that his Lady's dead, men would interpret His starts proceed from jealousie: I'll leave 'em. And wait some private opportunity. Exit. Cla. I must confess, Prince Carlo, Sir, hath courted me, But with a noble flame. Me. Flame me no flame, unless you mean to turn our family And name to ashes in the Kings displeasure. Thou do'st not know the Prince, as I doe, Clara. Enter Piracquo and Pedro. Pe. Sure you have known me, Sir, I have expected Some time, when you would own meâ Pi. Your name's Pedroâ Pe. You thought me of your blood, Sir, when you promis'd I should be your heir; I did a service for't Deserves your memory, not contempt, my Lord. Pi. Oh, thou didst well, and though as I then stood Proscrib'd, I wisht it otherwise, I now thank Thy witty cozenage, and allow thy faith Religious to thy Prince; be honest still. Pe. Honest? you are mistaken, I have been Honest to none but you, Sir. Pi. Be to thy self. Pe. I know not what you mean by witty cozenage; But to my danger, I may say, I did The feat as you desir'd; you know I did, And 'tis my wonder, what we both projected To make your own conditions for your pardon, And safe return, afcer proscription, Hath not been worth your use so many years; Where is the Prince? Pi. The Prince? you are witty, Kinsman. Pe. Nay if you slight me, Sir, and pay my service With this neglect, I can undone my self To make you find repentanceâ [offers to go in Pi. Come nearerâ Me. Therefore upon my blessing, if thou hast Such an ambitious thought, I charge thee leave it. Cla. Sir, you may spare these precepts, I have not Given away my freedom, or by promise Of more than may become my duty, offer'd The Prince an expectation; I am Not ignorant he is design'd a Bridegroom To the fair Isabella, and it were Sawcie injustice to distract a blessing Now hovering o'r two Kingdomsâ Me. Thou art wise; Preserve this duty. Ha! is not that Pedro? I doe not like their whisperâ Cla. You look pale, Sir. Pi. Can this be truth? was it Prince Carlo, then Without imposture was deliver'd me? Didst thou not couzen me? Pe. If I be mortall, Sir, It was my Ladies art, for her own safety, To put this trick upon the Court, which she Kept me from my Lord, untill upon her death-bed She made him overseer of the Secret. Men. Did he not name a Secret? Cla. You are troubled. Men. I? thou art deceiv'd. Pir. Ha! 'tis thy Lord Mendoza. Ped. He may take Some jealousie, if he observe our whisper. Pir. Adde, Pedro, but to this, thy future secresie, Till I mature some act, my thoughts now fix upon, And choose thy place within my heart; meet meâ Ped. Enough, you seal the mystery agen. Men. Pedro, come hither; What did you whisper? Enter a Gentleman. 1. Duke Roderigo, my Lord, desires Your conference in the garden. Pir. I'll attend him. Exeunt. Ped. He is my Kinsman, Sir, and did salute meâ Men. I would thou wert his Cosen ten removes (Pedro) as far as the two Poles are distant. Cla. My father need not fear Prince Carlo now; I find another guest here, 'tis Don Manuel Holds chief intelligence with my thoughts. Men. Well Pedro, Take heed, my life is in thy lipsâ Ped. I know my duty, Sir, if you suspect, Command me to be dumb; Sir, you must trust me. Men. I know not how to help it, wait upon My daughter. Exeunt I would my Lady had liv'd, or died without Bequeathing me this Legacy on her death-bed, A Secret to consume me; this servant, whom I dare not much displease, is all the witness Survives, sworn with the rest to secresie, And though I have small argument to suspect him, After so long a silence, yet I am Not safe to be at his devotion: I could soon purge him with a Fig, but that's Not honest: Was it ever known, a man So innocent, should have so many Agues In's conscience? I am weary of the Court; I must have some deviceâ Enter Roderigo and Piracquo. Duke Roderigo, And Don Piracquo? they are whispering too; This jealousie will take my brains apieces. Exit. Ro. I have said, &amp; now expect, my Lord, your answer. Pi. I must acknowledge from your Grace, a favour, That you have been so clear, and free with me; I might have thought my self secure i'th' dark, And ignorant of this expectation, Incurr'd your Graces jealousie. Ro. I had allwaies A firm opinion of your Lordships gratitude. Pi. But for the sum, he fifty thousand Ducats, I must acknowledge, if your Grace had mediated My pardon then with the good King, your brother, It had oblig'd my payment; but my cause Not worth your Graces agitation, Or breath, was like a vessell struck upon Some shelf, without all hope t'have sayl'd agen, Had not the Prince's mercie, when he came To Portugal, reliev'd it with a galc, And set my bark afloat. Ro. The Prince? Why? doth your Lordship think I had no part I'th' work of your repair? the power, and office I hold at Court, is not asleep, my Lord, When any act of grace is done by th'King. Pi. I dare not do so much injustice to The Prince's bounty, to divide and ow But half the benefit to his Grace; I not Extenuate your prevalence at Court, but His Highness did compassionate my exile, And I am return'd by his commands, my Lord, I am his creature for it, and shall sooner Lose what he hath preserv'd, my life and peace here, Than doubt his honour, or dispute his power In my behalf. Ro. Sir, you are not safe yet, There has past no seal, I take it, for your pardon. You hang i'th' air, not fixt to th'roof of heaven, As when you shin'd a star; take heed you prove No Comet, a prodigious thing snatch'd up To blaze, and be let fall agen, upon Their eyes, that so mistook the region Where you were plac'd. Pi. I know, my Lord, your greatness, And hold it not becoming, to contest In language wi'ee; but I am confidentâ Ro. Of what? Pi. And will wager, if your Grace please, The to'ther fifty thousand Ducats, Sir, That I'll not pay you a Marvedie; if I may On other honourable terms possess Your favour, I shall meet your just commands, But if you set such price upon your smiles, After the Prince's honor to secure me, I know my self, my fortune, and upon What strength I must depend. Ro. I shall, my Lord, Send you to sea agen. Pi. I made a shift, and may agen, my Lord, Amongst the Merchants. Ro. Pirateâ Pi. 'Tis confest, I was so, but your Grace may be inform'd I was not born to th'trade, I had a soul Above my fortune, and a toy I took To lose what was beneath my birth and titles, Or purchase an estate fit to sustain 'em; The sea was my Exchequer; for I thriv'd, I thank my watry Destinies, and commanded Many a tall ship, won with so much horror, As possibly would have made your Lordship (had you But in a cloud, or airie scaffold stood Spectator of our fight) sweat out your soul Like a thin vapour with the fright, and after Drop your forsaken body on our deck, To encrease the number of the dead. Ro. But we May deal with you at land agen. Pi. With reverence to your blood as 'tis the Kings, withall my age, My wounds upon me, and that innocence, The Prince's word hath new created in me, I do not fearâ Ro. Whom? Pi. The Devil. Ro. I shall conjure down the spirit. Pi. Hell hath not art to keep it down. Ro. So brave? Pi. So just. Ro. Thou talking fool, do'st think I have no stings? Pi. I know you are a Statesman, Sir, but he That fears with his own innocence about him, Deserves not a protectionâ [offers to go in. Ro. Piracquo, Stay, I now see thou hast a gallant spirit, Let me embrace thee, and with this confirm An honourable friendship; I have not A thought so base to injure thee. Pi. I haveâ An easy faith my Lordâ Ro. Farewellâ Noble Piracquo, I have tri'd and found thee. Pi. I wo'not trust you for all this; I know The Devill's excellent at the hug; your Servant. Enter Manuell and Clara, at the other dore Maria. Man. The Princess. Mar. I doe not like his Courtship there. Don Manuelâ (Manuel leaves Clara, and goes to Maria. Ro. So gratious with my Neece? I'll make him curse Those smilesâ Exit. Cl. All is not well within me, and the Princess Was never so unwelcome; they conferr With much delight, or else my fears abuse me. What hath she in the greatness of her birth, That I should be so passive? Heaven look on Our hearts, and if my love want a degree Of noble heat, when they are both compar'd, Let what I carry be the Funerall pile, And my own flame consume it. Ha, the Prince Enter Carlo. I shall betray my self too soon I fear. Car. My sweetest Clara! Mar. Either there were no Ladies that could love In that Court, or you could not want a Mistris. Man. They are not born with incapacity Of loving, where they find a worth t'invite: The fault was in my undesert, that could Attract no Ladies grace to own me there, So inconsiderable a servant Madam. Ma. There is some hope, you wil not be thought here Unworthy of a nobler Character; I doe not think but Clara hath a better Opinion of your merit. Car. You cannot be so cruell; what could in My absence interpose, to make your heart Unkind to those desires at my return? Cla. My justice, and the care of both our honours, I have not lost; nor can Time make me forfeit, (What Nature, and the Laws of Heaven and Earth Command me to preserve) my duty Sir. What is above, would tast ambitious. Car. This was not wont. Cla. If any of your smiles, Or favours Sir before, have led my tongue To unbecoming boldness, you have mercy: Some things of errour are exalted by Our bold belief, when Princes make themselves But merry with their servants, who are apt To antedate their honour, and expound, In their own flattery, the text of Princes. Car. But is all this in earnest? Enter Roderigo and Antonio. Ro. Is not that Don Manuell with the Princess? Observe Sir. An. They are pleasant. Ro. Dare he presume? An. Vexation! Cla. While I have The memory of what you are, a Prince, And dare believe what is as true, as talk'd of, Your Contract made in Portugall to the Princess Isabellaâ Car. No Contract Madam; I confesse, To please my Father, who engag'd me to The travel, I did seem to court the Princess, And with some shadows of a promise, might Advance her expectation; but here I left my heart, and dare appeal to thine. An. Madamâ Mar. Your Graces pardon but a minute. An. Sirâ [To Manuell. Mar. Nay then I shall repent I ask'd your pardon. An. I ha' done, and will attend your Graces pleasure. Mar. I am now at your commands. Exe. Ro. Clara his Mistris? Car. Possible! was not that Prince Antonio, Uncle? Ro. Yes Sir, and gone displeased, He hath been affronted by that Gentleman. Car. He dares not be so rude. Ro. He dares be insolent, and court your Sister. Car. How? my Sister? be less ambitious, Manuel. Ro. Your favours have exalted him too much. Car. But I can change my brow. Ro. It does become you. Exeunt. Man. The Prince did frown upon me, Madam, you Are wise, as well as fair, can you resolve The Prince's riddle? Cla. Sir, I have no art To decypher mysteries, but if I erre not, He nam'd his Sister. Ma. Ha! Cla. With caution you should be less ambitious. Ma. 'Tis so, he's jealous of my courtship there, It can be nothing else, can it, sweet Madam? I dare make you the judge of all my thoughts, Unbosom every counsell, and divest My soul of this thin garment that it wears, To let your eye examine it; if you find Within that great diaphanal an atome Look black, as guilty of the Prince's anger, Let him doom me to death, or if that be Not punishment enough, be you more cruel, And frown upon me too. Cla. If I were judge, Without such narrow, and severe dissection, Don Manuel, of your heart, I should declare Boldly your innocence, and rather than A frown of mine should rob your thought of quiet, I would deprive mine eyes of what they honour, By a more cruel absence. Ma. But to be Assured of so much charity I could wish My self in some degrees a guilty person, And stand the Prince's anger; but if I Be cleer'd in your opinion, I dread not The malice of accusers; yet if you had Wav'd my integrity, I had an argument To have convinc'd you, Madam, that Maria, Though sacred in her person, was to me No more enflaming than a peece of Alabaster, Which some great Master's hand had shap'd a Virgin; For if you dare believe me, you have won By your virtue here so much dominion, There is no room to entertain a guest, Much less a competition. Oh Madam, I took so strange a charm in at my eyes When first your presence made 'em happy, that To say I onely lov'd you, were prophane, And would detract from that religious honour, My heart in that first minute promis'd you. Cla. I know not in what language, Sir, to dress My answer, but in that small skill I have, Sir, of my self, I am not guilty of Unkind rewards, where I can understand A fair respect invite 'em; yet if you But flatter, for it is hard to say, when men Dissemble not at Courtâ Ma. The curse of Virgins, and What else can make a Lover miserable Feed on my heart, that minute I betray Your faith by any treason of my tongue: I must not live with your suspicion on me; Why doe you obscure your face? Cl. I doe but hide Sir an unruly blush that's stoln into My cheek; I fear a Spy, that hath discovered, And would tell what complexion my heart has. Pray leave me. Ma. That command Receiv'd but faint commission from your heart, From whence those am'rous spies your blushes came; It had a sound like Virgins, when they teach A way to be denied. Pardon sweet Madam, If I presume to interpret my own happiness; Your eyes are not so kind to obscure themselves Behind that cloud, they may behold me kiss He kisses her hand. Your hands with this devotion, and not Repent to be a witness. Did you not Feel a chaft trembling on my lip? with such A fear doe Pilgrims salute holy Shrines, And touch the flesh of Martyrs: but this circumstance Is but the pomp, no essence of affection. Say, can you love me, Madam? if your tongue Not us'd to such a dialect, refuse Articulate consent, a smile will make No noise, speak that way; I will keep this hand Both a white pledge, and prisoner, till your eye Or welcome accent doe redeem it from me; Or if you still be silent, I'll secure My fate, and teach your hand without a voyce To chant a Song to Hymen. What help of tongue need they require, Or use of other art, Whose hands thus speak their chast desire, And grasp each others heart? Weak is that chain that's made of air, Our tongues but chafe our breath, When Palms thus meet, there's no despair To make a double wreath. Give but a sigh, a speaking look, I care not for more noise, Or let me kiss your hand, the Book, And I have made my choyce. Weeping? I'le kiss those drops away. Cla. Awayâ Ma. That eccho was not sweet, yet being thineâ Cla. I am too much thine. Ma. There's no place for fears; Love is the purest, when 'tis washt in tears.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. Enter King and Roderigo. Ki. Dares he be so insolent allready? we Shall humble him. Ro. He durst affront me Sir; And when I urg'd the folly of his pride, Tell me, he knew himself, and on what strength He must depend; words of a dangerous consequence. Ki. My Son hath been too forward. Ro. He affects him strangely. Ki. Whose undertaking must not bind beyond The rule of our own greatness. Ro. Your Son is full Of honourable thoughts, but being young, May meet with subtle natures, whose oblique And partial ends want no dissembled forms Of duty to betray him. This Piracquo In his experience of the world, hath art, And can from every accident extract A cunning use of time, and dispositions; And 'tis not to be doubted but the man Practiz'd in storms, and rapine (by which he Hath drawn a wealth above your treasury) May find a minute apt for his revenge Upon your justiceâ He that is a Pirate In the first act of spoyl he makes, doth open His conscience at sea, and throws the key Into the waves. Ki. He hath acquir'd a mighty wealth. Ro. But who can number their undoings and wet eys That have been rob'd? how many lives and fortunes Of your own subjects have increas'd the pile Of his estate and cruelty? think o'that: And if you can bring nearer thoughts, and look Upon your self, your present sums are lean, Compar'd to what did swell your treasury; Your customs are less numerous for his thefts, And your great debts and charge upon your crown, Are call'd upon, but drouzy with their weight, They make no answer to the kingdoms clamour. Some King, to whom the waves had sent a wrack So great upon his shore, would both secure, And call the timely benefit, a providence. Ki. 'Tis not too late. Ro. Wise Princes that have law &amp; strength about 'em, Must take all forfeits; he that is too tame In Soveraignty, makes treason his own judge, And gives a patent to be disobey'd. Ki. Let him be sent for streight. Ro. To hear him plead? What Traytor did want reasons of defence? Command him safe first, see his wealth seal'd up Against the confiscation; Kings must act, And not dispute their maxims; I could much Amaze you, Sir, with other argument To prove Piracquo's insolence; his son (And 'tis to be believ'd, in things of consequence Their counsels often meet) Don Manuel, Hath been ambitious to court Maria, Your daughter, Sir. Ki. Unsufferable impudence! Ro. Antonio too suspects him, and what honor You can maintain with the Prince, &amp; what danger It may produce; if this resented, and Proclam'd, beget a War upon your countryâ For Treaties are the immunities of Kings, Subjects adulterate the Prince's coyn, Not without high injustice, but he that Doth play the wanton with his royal promise, Defaceth his own stamp, and teacheth, by His violation, others not to trust him. Enter Antonio and Manuel fighting. Enter Lords. Ki. Treason! Man. Be fearless, Sir, I am provok'd Beyond the sufferings of a Gentleman. Ro. Where is the guard? no mischief the result Of such a skirmish? Ma. I was not made for servitude, nor must I Have patience, when the greatest man is in Spain, Whose title cannot challenge my subjection, Throws infamy upon me. An. Do the Kings Of Spain allow this sawcy privilege Against a Prince. Ki. Not we: To prison with him. You shall be judge your self, and set the punishment Upon his insolent act; away with him. Man. Not hear me? this is tyranny. Ro. Away, d'ee make a cypher of the King? Manuel guarded off. Ki. May we Entreat to know the circumstance? An. I must Acknowledge, Sir, I had suspicion Of some attempts by him against my honor, Which made me first provoke him. Ki. Dare he hope To keep a thought unpunished? Enter Piracquo. Pi. Sir, I met My Son by your command lead prisoner hence, It will not unbecome your royall justice, To let me know his crime, I am no father To any sin he dares commit against Your Laws, or person. Ki. You came in good time. Another guard for him. Pi. A guard? for what? Ki. You shall know that hereafter. An. I shall beseech, my cause against Don Manuel May not involve his innocence; my Lord Piracquo is full of honor. 1. The Duke's gone. 2. Nay he is right, at the wrong end of a cause still. An. If they be crimes against your state, I am not To prescribe your Justice, Sir. Ki. Away with him. Enter a Gentleman with a Letter to Antonio. An. To me? I have seen this character. Enter Carlo, Piracquo, Guard. Car. Return him at my peril, Sir. Lord 2. What do you think of my Lord Piracquo? Lord 1. I think he's gone to prison; yet I think He's here agen, if that be he; for we are Not sure of any thing at Court. Now, my Lordâ Pi. Do any of you know, my Lords, wherefore I am under guard? 1. Not we. Pi. I could not satisfie the Prince's question. 2. Your sons offence was an affront to th'Prince Antonio. Pi. That was not well; 'twas Some high provocation made him lose his temper. 1. They were at it with their swords. Pi. No hurt, I hope? 2. The Prince's feather discompos'd, or so. Pi. This was not my fault, Gentlemen. Car. Proclame to th'world I'm not your son, take off Mine and your peoples expectation, And then 'tis no dishonor; for to be Believed the Prince at the same time, and one That dares betray a Gentleman from's Sanctuary, To be a sacrifice at home, are things Of inconsistent nature, and destructive. Charge him with new committed crimes, since I Gave him my word and honour to secure him, And there he stands, without an Altar to Protect him; but far be it from the King, To make it a new treason to be rich; It will be thought your avarice to his wealth, And read in story to your shame for ever, Piracquo died to pay your debts. 1. The Prince Solicites hard; the King inclines. Ca. I know This doth not, Sir, proceed from your own soul, But some malignant nature, that hath drop'd, And would infect your ear with wicked counsell; 'Twas some malicious enemy to me, And to your fame (as well as Don Piracquo His life and fortune) hath conspir'd to make Me less than Prince, and you unfit to be A King, when once men catch at your inconstancie. For I must pray you to remember, Sir, I had your royall promise to confirm My undertaking for his facts at sea, And give me leave to say, Sir, this dishonorable Retreat will stagger all your people faith: A King to break his sacred word, will teach The great men to be safe without your service; Who will beleeve your smiles are snares to catch Their fortunes; and when once the crowd takes sent Of this, you leave your self no oath to swear by. 2. The Prince bestirs himself bravely in your cause. Pi. I may do something to reward it, one day. Sir, shall I speak? not in my own defence; For since I came to Spain, I have not been Guilty in thought of any breach of duty; Nor for my son, if youth or ignorance Have made him erre, my humble knees beseech My cause may take no royall beam from him, That now is pleas'd to be my Advocate, Your son; in whom there's such an active heat Of honor, better all my blood was scatter'd Than you should frown upon him. But I know If I had payd the Duke your brother, Sir, But fifteen thousand Ducatsâ Ki. Ha? what then? Pi. I had bought my peace, and been commended by His Grace to your full pardon. 1. Boldly urg'd. Ca. Was it his act? Ki. We restore thee, Piracquo, to thy self, and us; and let Our largest pardon for all past offences Be ready for our signature; my brother, I'll promise reconcil'd too: Carlo, thou Hast but confirm'd our hope, nor did we purpose This other than a tryal of thy temper, Thy gratitude, and jealousie of thy honor: Preserve them still thus, Carlo, nothing wants To fix our Kingdoms joy, but the compleating Thy mariage with the Princess Isabella, Which shall be done by Proxy, when Antonio Hath made his courtship perfect with thy Sister. Who saw the Duke Mendoza? send for him; He doth too much absent himself. Exe. Manet Carlo. Car. By Proxy? The Duke Mendoza's counsell is too busie To advance that, and Clara is grown cold, Or seems so, in her cunning to provoke My flame; but I must teach her how to meet it. My father may be wrought to a consent When things are done; forgive me, Isabella, My first thoughts cannot on thy beauty wait, I am not master of my love, or fate. Exit. Enter Pedro. Pe. Things are not now so desperate, whilst my Lord Piracquo keeps possession; but if I were Worthy to advise his Lordship, he should not lose Much time to settle things, secrets do burnâ Enter Mendoza. His grace; now for a fit of jealousieâ I'll be hereâ Men. He's troublesome in my eye, and yet I cannot Endure him from my sight. Pe. That's I. Me. Methinks he hath every day a more discovering look, There's Scaffolds in his face; I shall prevent him, And send him far enough, with the next Fleet He goes, the Sea may roar, and crack the Cabbins, Or he may meet the Calenture; I have heard Of Hericanoes that have torn up Mountains, One boysterous enough would strike his Ship Clean through, a'tother side to the Antipodes, And that would cure me; all my Art must be To win him to the Voyage, and not stir His jealousie; the Knave is apprehensive. Pe. Are you good at that? Exit. Me. I doe not like his business with Piracquo, 'Tis for no good, I'll break their correspondence; Piracquo has been honourable, yet I doe not much confide in himâhe's here; Enter Pedro. Come hither Pedro. Re. Your Graces Pleasure? Me. What consult Have you with Don Piracquo? Pe. Please your Grace, He hath been fishing, some or other have Infus'd a scruple, I'll engage my life: But though he be my Kinsman, and a Lord I honour, and from whom I have receiv'd The promise of a Fortune, and a great one, Yet, I have said littleâ Me. Hast said any thing? Pe. How could I choose Sir? he did squeez me subtly, But I was wise, and faithfull to your trust, He knows no more than I, or youâ Me. Ha? Pe. Wou'd wish him Sir, let me alone to be cautious. Me. Th'art honest Pedro, and I have been studying How to encourage and reward thy service, And I have thought of a preferment for thee. Pe. Your Grace was ever bountifull. Me. A place Of honour and command. Pe. That will do well Sir; And shal I come in as your Churchmen do? No first-fruits to be paid twice in a year, No buying of a Jewell at the rate Of fifteen hundred times the value Sir? Me. Remove that care. Pe. That care is well remov'd. Me. I have consider'd, that to live at home My Servant, is to dark thy abilities, That will abroad shine, and doe services Worth Spain's acknowledgement. Pe. Abroad? why, must I travell? Me. By any means. Pe. Whither, an't please your Grace? Me. But to the Indies. Pe. No farther? Columbus did it in 7 years, And less. Me. In the next Fleet thou shalt have an imployment Shall speak my care of thee, and interest With his Catholick Majestie; he shall deny Me hard, but I'll prevail to make thee of His Councill there, and the State Secretary. Pe. This is a mighty honour. Me. We may hold Correspondence still by Letters, thou art wise; The King shall knight thee too of Calatrava; How will it joy my heart to write to thee, Al Signor illustrissimo Don Pedro. Enter Gentleman. Gent. Sir, the King hath sent for you? Me. For me? Pe. Yes, Sir, I could have told your Grace His Majesty commanded your attendance. Me. For what? Pe. I know not that, but I suspect There hath been some intelligence, however Go, Sir, it may do worse, and argue guilt, To be commanded twice. Me. Intelligence? It will be worth my safety to confess. Pe. By no means, Sir, that simplicity Would rather become me. Me. Why? wo't thou confess? Pe. Not, unless you begin; go Sir, an't be But to prepare his Majesty, for me To wear the order of the Caletrava; You have put me, Sir, into the gang of going This Indian voyage. Me. Well, I must to the King. Pe. Shall I attend you? Me. Yesânoâdo what thou wilt; yet now I think on't 'Twill be as well to goâyet do not neither. Pe. Be chearfull, Sir, why doth your head shake so? Me. My head? Pe. It trembles like the Needle of a Sun-dial, d'ee not feel it? Me. Ha? yes 'tis here; but do not breath upon me; I feel the very wind of thy words blow it To and agen like a Weather-cock; but I must go. Pe. I will prepare my self for this voyage. Forget not the Calatrava. Me. I would thou wert shiptâ Pe. And sunk. It shall go hard but I'll requite your Lordship. Exe. Enter Clara and Servant. Cla. A prisoner saist? Ser. 'Tis a confirm'd report. Cla. I fear Prince Carlo's jealousie is cause Of this; poor Manuel, it will not be Safe, or seem honorable for me to visit him: But since I cannot suffer with him, he Ex. Ser. Shall hear I dare confine my self to sorrow. Enter Servant. Ser. Madam, the Princess Maria is coming up the stairs. Cla. I must dissemble now my grief, and meet her, yet I may intreat her Graces mediation To the King for his enlarge. Enter Maria. Ma. Let us be private. If e'r thou lov'dst me, Clara, now express it. Cla. I have an humble sute to your Highness, which In hope to prosper, will direct my faith, And services to what you can prescribe me. Speak your commands. Ma. Don Manuel stands committed by the King, And I would have thy counsell, how I should Best work his liberty. Cla. That, Madam, is All my petition to your Grace. Ma. I know my least desire let fall to th'Prince Antonio, were enough to engage, and make him The Orator to effect it, but in honor I would not contrive him the means, and instrument To advance his Rival's liberty. Cla. Rivall, Madam? Ma. For I must tell thee, Clara, and with it Give up the secret of my soul, I love Don Manuel, I fear, better than my self. Cla. You do not mock me, I hope, Madam? Ma. No, By all that Ladies once in love do pray for, By him thou lov'st, who e'r he be, and this Kiss (that I rather wish on Manuel's lip, Would modesty and honor give it privilege And durst entrust thy faith to carry it to him, In my experience of thy virtue, Clara) I speak no fable. Cla. It becomes my truth To answer yours, though not so cheerfully; I should not much repent, to carry, Madam, Your kiss to Manuel, but I fear, I should Forget who sent it. If you have a plot To raise mirth from my weakness, when you know How much my heart is his, I yeeld my self Your triumph, Madam, but the glories of Your blood, and title are not price enough To buy him from my thoughts, could you invest My name with their possession. Ma. Doth she love him? I have destroy'd my own hope then; alass Poor Clara, I must pitty thee, and for that Love that hath been between us, I'll apply To cure thy wound; for mine is not so desperate, Though I bleed inwards, I confess, since he, Whom I esteem best, suffers for Maria. Cla. Suffer for you? pray Madam, clear this mystery. Ma. It is poor Manuel's fortune to affect Me with a passion great; as mine, and love, That like a rebell forrageth our soul, And can obey no law, but what it likes, Impatient that Antonio lov'd me too, Made him forget the Prince, and gave the affront, For which he suffers in the Kings displeasure. Cla. No repetition of this story, Madam, Lest you destroy all my belief in virtue; It cannot be, you may as soon perswade That snow, the innocent fleece of heaven, that's born Upon the fleet wings of some sportive wind, Is Ethiop's wooll, as call this truth. Ma. This will be rudeness, Clara, if you do not Convince, and with more reason, and with temper. And 'tis no little wonder, that when I Have fairly thus disclos'd my thoughts of Manuel, You should retain a murmuring thought, and dare Pretend rivality with me. Cla. The law You gave to love, that stoopes to no prerogative Of birth, or name (mine only a degree Beneath your own) will answer your disdain, And justifie my passion; and if reason And temper (which in vain you think are lost In me) be assign'd judges, I dare more Than say I love, I can deserve himâ Ma. Better? Fate bring it to a tryall. Cla. So just are my affections, I dare make A Saint my judge. Ma. That Judge you make, is not A friend to so much pride. Cla. You are but my accuser, Madam. Ma. This affront I must Remember, Clara, and find time to teach You know me better. Cla. Madam, as you are The Princess, I can fall thus low, to kiss Your hand, and pay all duties that become me, Or your command; but if you think by being Great, I must own no passion, but in what Degree you are pleas'd to fix it, nor compare My soul born with its freedome to affection, With yours, because one shaft hath wounded both, I rise my own defender. Ma. Thy own ruine For this presumption. Cla. I'll not bribe your mercy, When you can love as I doe, we may both Deserve him equally: Oh Manuell! Ex. Maria. Though I defend thy honour to the Princess, Yet he hath scatter'd seeds of jealousie About my heart, if this ground fertile prove, I wo'not curse his faith, but my own love. Exit. Manuell in Prison. Man. Why should we murmur to be circumscrib'd, As if it were a new thing to wear fetters? When the whole World was meant but to confine us; Wherein who walks from one Clime to another, Hath but a greater freedome of the Prison; Our Soul was the first Captive, born to inherit But her own Chains, nor can it be discharg'd Till Nature tire with its own weight, and then We are but more undone to be at liberty. Enter Carlo. The Prince, he brings a storm, I see it rising As Seamen doe, the wind far off. Car. Don Manuell, Man. You have nam'd a suffering man, but one that holds His life and death at such an even rate, No matter which is first employ'd, with honour. I dare submit me to your justice Sir. Car. Your Cause would droop to trust to that, my love Willing to justifie the choyce it made In thee, hath pleaded better, and prevail'd With me to bring thee counsell to redeem Thy self becomingly. Ma. Your goodness flows still, 'Twas not the Prince that frown'd. Ca. Submit your self to Prince Antonio. Man. Submit my self? Ca. Ask him forgiveness. Man. I must be guilty first of an offence, Ere my tongue be so base, and ask a pardon. Ca. Then I must chide you Manuell; deny This triviall satisfaction? your crime Will upon second thoughts be much enlarg'd, Nor will the Prince be ever thought to merit His birth and name, unless he kill thee for't, 'Tis an affront of so supreme a nature. Man. Hath it no name Sir? Car. Dost not shake to ask it? Are you Sir a fit Rivall for the Prince? Abstract that she's my Sister, which consider'd, Carries so vast a guilt against the Kings, Mine, and Maria's honour, all thy bloud Mixt with repentance cannot purge; you are Instructed Sir. Man. Not yet, to know my self Conscious of any action should contract The Prince's brow, or yours, much less deserve The horrid name of guilt against the Kings, Yours, and Maria's honour. Car. Did not you Sir court my Sister? Man. Never Sir. Car. Doe not you love her? Man. Heaven in that word includes all that we owe His precept; 'Tis my justice, Sir, to love her; But with a greater distance, than she is From me remov'd by birth; and if her smile Meant the reward of my attendance, Sir, At any time have met with false observers, Their tongues, and no audacious thought of mine, Or application, are in fault; I have, Beside the lesson of my birth, been taught A piety from your favours, Sir, to know My self their creature, and with humble thoughts To shew my gratitude, not proudly assume (Could she descend) a Courtship to Maria, Who by the King, &amp; every good mans vote, Is meant a sacred pledge to Portugal, To chain two kingdoms. Car. If this, Manuel, Be truthâ Man. Without condition of my liberty, Or dread of what Antonio shall attempt In his revenge, my soul dare wth ith an oath Confirm it at the Altar. Car. This doth please me. Possess thy first place in my friendship, Manuel; Antonio shall embrace thee too, his ear And mine have been abus'd. Man. There was A providence upon our Swords, that meant Less fatall than his passion shew'd, when we Last met, against whose weapon threatning me first, The safety of my fame, more than my life, Call'd up my just defence. Car. I do beleeve thee; To what a loss of virtue, and of blood Credulity engageth? this shall be No more thy dwelling; Prince Antonio Shall for thy honor make it his own act, Who yet believes thy interest in Maria Hath made his Courtship vain, and will I fear, Not presently admit thy innocence Into his quiet faith, but I'll convince him. Man. If he but knew my heart, he should not need Much argument; no man can love with honour, And let his thoughts divide upon two Mistrisses. I have contracted loveâ Car. With whom? may Time, When this World fails, and Nature grows decrepit; Present it to Eternity. Man. This prayer opens my heart, and all the wealth within it, Commands me draw the Curtain from her name, That you may read my Clara, And I shall beseech your Graces smileâ Car. Your Clara? what The Duke Mendoza's Daughter? Man. You have nam'd her. Car. No, I am i'th' dark still, speak agen, Or rather say, thou hast mistook, it is Some other Clara, and not the Lady I understand. Man. Life cannot bribe me with another wealth, Or death with all his horrours make me desert That name. Car. What a strange Sea-breach has This little storm of breath made here allready? I was taking pains to unconcern the jealousie Of Antonio, and find him my own Rivall; Thou hadst been kinder to have lov'd Maria My Sister, though Antonio had sworn Thy death, and the Kings anger with my own Had met thee like a torrent, than presum'd This interest in Clara. Man. I see no Such mighty danger in't. Car. I'll tell thee, Manuel, Thou hast invaded all my joys, I love her. Man. Honor forbid it, Sir. Car. Honor's a dream, And a cold everlasting sleep must chain My soul up; for if once it wake, and know What thou hast torn from't, it will vex it self Into a flame, and turn thee into ashes. Ma. Never til now unhappy, with my weight I see my self now bearing down before me, A rotten part of some prodigious mountain Into the sea, with which I shall soon mingle. Ca. Collect thy self betimes, and give her back Unsullied with thy clame, release thy own, And with her, every thought as much a virgin As her soul was, when first I courted her, Or thou art lostâ Man. With greater justice, Sir, Command to uncreate my self, as call My faith or heart agen. Ca. How? Man. Sir, my life, The cement that doth hold this frame together, You have power to melt, or but command my exile, And I may live far off, and be forgotten By all, but Clara; but to ask that back, Which with the full consent of heaven I gave her (And in exchange receiv'd her equall vow) I dare not, or if I had will, to be So false to honour, 'tis within my heart So rivetted, I may with as much innocence Commit a rape, or murder, as attempt it. Ca. You have no doubt a valour too, that dare Love with so fierce a resolution. Man. When I am master of my sword, I dare Not draw it against you; but he that lives Beneath you, may have little time to wish Himself unmade that would divorce us. Car. Leave me, leave meâ Ex Man. How many lones are shaken with one tempest? And if one suffer, ruin'd all? I know The faith he bears me, and the reverence He gives my blood, will never be provok'd To fight against my person; but I must not By tameness give my self a publike wound; He shall be master of his sword and freedom, And then let fate determine; Clara must Be mine, or make a Bridegroom of his dust. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. III. Enter Gentlemen of Prince Antonio, preparing a Banquet. 1. Prince Carlo's not come yet. 2. My Lord Piracquo And his son Manuel are expected too. 1. I wonder at this hasty reconcilement; We did imagine it as possible The two Poles should have met, as they together Friends at a Banquet. 2. In my opinion, peace, and wine, and musick, Are more convenient for the naturall body, Than swords or guns. 1. And for the politick too, If men were but so wise to like, and cherish Their own estates: If I had all the Plate In the Indies, I'd not give a silver spoon To have my head cut off. 2. Why is not the great Duke Roderigo here? 1. Who, the Kings Evil Genius? he was Invited, but excus'd himself. 2. Why, there's A Statesman, that can side with every faction, And yet most subtly can untwist himself When he hath wrought the business up to danger. He lives within a labyrinth, some think He deals with the devil, and he looks like one, With a more Holiday face. 1. But he hath so behav'd himself, That no man now dare much confide in him. They are come. Enter Antonio, Carlo, Piracquo, Manuel. An. Don Manuel, the Prince hath made me know My error, and your worth. Ma. He has too much honor'd me, And you have reason to command for this The service of my life. An. You are not pleasant, Sirâ My Lord Piracquo. Pi. Your Highness humble servant. Car. All is not Reconcil'd here, I but suppress a flame, To give it vent more dangerous. An. A free welcom to all; Sit, and some wine; this Musick is not Sprightly enough: To his Majesty of Spainâ Pi. He that doth pledg the Kings health with a murmur May his next thirst inflame him to drink poyson. Car. The King hath a true servant in Piracquo. Man. He that is not, had never sense of honor; And may he perish all but soul, that dares Harbour a thought disloyall. To your Highnessâ An. Give me another: This wine looks cheerful as my heart, to drink The Princess fair Maria's health. Car. My turn Will come, Sir, to be gratefull. An. Here my Lord. Pi. May swift time perfect by your sacred Loves, The happiness of both kingdoms. Man. May that day, That seals your glorious Hymen, Sir, be ever Holy within our Calendar, and beget A faith, that all things then begun, may prosper. An. I thank thee, Manuel. Car. Sir, you may Believe Don Manuel's language, and his heart Are twins, they bear one date of time, &amp; sense. You must now give me leave, Sir, to requite You in part; A health to the King of Portugal; Let it move this way, Manuel. Ma. It shall With humble thoughts be entertain'dâyou honor me. Pi. It is but Justice Manuel; for when Spain Would not acknowledge, nor allow us being, Our lives were welcome there, till better stars Sent him, to whose bounty we ow all that's left us. Car. No more o'that my Lord, I am very confident, In any honorable cause, you dare Express your faith to me; and for your son, We two have been companions, I dare say, Our hearts are toucht by one Magnetick virtue, And such a sympathy, I cannot wish What's dearest to me, but he flies t'embrace it. Ma. I like not thisâ Car. Manuel, begin a health: We have had my Sisters and the Kings already, Name your own Mistris for the next. Ma. I should conclude her worthy of remembrance, Sir, If one were first preferr'd. Will your Grace please To let me have the honorâ An. Come, to me. Ma. To the white hand of fairest Isabella. An. Would she were Present to thank you Manuel. Car. 'Tis an affront, as Clara were his own Allready; ha! civilitie and honor Prescribe me patience, dares he insult? When this hath had the ceremony, Manuel, 'T shall be my office to remember Clara; I must have time to quit the favour, Sir, Y'ave done my Mistris; in your ear; though I Was pleased to reconcile you to the Prince, And order your enlargement, Clara must Be mine, or one of us be nothing; you May think on't yet. Ma. I have Sir, and to shew How much I can obey, and that I have not Intruded like a thief upon your treasure, And filcht her heart away, 'tis now within Her choice agen, if you prevail upon Her kinder thoughts, I can sit down despis'd. Car. Thou art my best friend now. Antonioâ Me-thinks we are not pleasantâif she should Be a little obstinate, it would become, And speak the bravery of thy soul, and service, To use some language for me, wo't thou Manuel? Thou dost not know the sufferings of my soul For Clara. Man. But I pitty 'em. Car. 'Tis new balsom Into my wounds; where is the health, Piracquo? I feel new spirits dancing in my blood, The health begun to Clara languisheth, Why should I want it, Gentlemen? An. It was nam'd By Manuel to my Sister Isabella; Prince Carlo, you forget. Car. To Isabella? Your Graces pardon, I confess my error, I forgot her indeed, but could your wishes Translate that Princess hither, she should be A witness of my honourable thoughts. Enter Isabella with Ladies. (Musick.) What Magick's this? do any know that face? Pi. 'Tis very like the Princess Isabella. Ca. I would she were a Ghost; Antonio, Ha you got enchantments? Is. You may stay, Sir. Ca. I love not to converse with spirits. Ma. Sir, This is no shadow. Car. It is to me, Sir. Meet me at Clara's, or be lost to honour. Exit. Is. It was your Counsell brother, that reserv'd me For this first entertainment. My good Lord Piracquo, and Don Manuel, you seem not So much affrighted, as the Prince. Pi. A devill In such a shape could never fright me, Madam; But persons of your quality shift not so Much air without a noise; the motion Of Princes has much rumor to attend it. Is. I chose to come so private, I arriv'd The City but last evening. Ma. You have much Honour'd Madrid. Is. Why, how now brother, are You frighted too? An. Yes, and do sweat at soul, To see our selves neglected. Is. Some are not fortified against a sudden accident; In my desert, and innocence, I can Interpret nothing yet in my dishonour, Since joyes have extasies sometimes, and with Their rapture may transport our senses from us, As soon as any other passion. Besides, I heard him wish me here a witness Of honourable thoughts, he has but now Remov'd his person, to acquaint the King, With greater preparation to receive A Guest so unexpected. Pi. But I like not the Prince's humor, you Had whisperings Manuel I observ'd. Man. I shall Keep nothing Sir in Clouds from you. An. Thou sha't direct me Isabella, wee'l to Court My Lord Piracquo, Manuel. Is. How ere I put a valiant brow on his neglect, And seem to make a gloss in his defence, My soul is sick with fear. An. Come Isabella. Pi. We both attend your grace. Exit. Enter Roderigo. Ro. My engins want success, Piracquo is Restor'd to his full being, and his Son At large, and reconcil'd by Carlo's act. My Nephew had been better to have wak'd A sleeping Dragon, than have crost my aims; He has rescu'd them, but drawn upon his bosome As many wounds as policy and my Revenge can make. I was too tame, to strike At useless Shrubs, that hinder not my prospect; My thoughts should have no study but a Kingdome; It is my Heaven, and this young Cedar spread; Betwixt my eyes, and it; I have allready Betray'd his love to Clara, and the King That hath made up an Idoll to himself Of honour, is inflam'd to my own wishes; I know the Prince will be impatient To hear his Mistris tost by the Kings anger, And he may leap into some disobedience, That may be worth my second charge to sink him; And then Piracquo, Manuel, and the Kingdome Shall stoop to my devotion; yet I carry A smiling brow to all, and please the King, To think I am reconcil'd. Enter Carlo. My Nephewâ Car. Where is the King? Ro. Where I left him displeas'd, and was now coming To Prince Antonio's Lodgings to acquaint you. Car. With what? Ro. Have you contracted love with Duke Mendoza's Daughter, the Lady Clara? Car. What officious Tongue hath been bold to mention her? Ro. He has Had some intelligence, and is almost grown Wild with the strange resentment, I not knowing What to object against his passion, thus Surpriz'd, you may believe apply'd what lenitives My understanding could collect o'th' sudden, With confidence, when you came to give account, The accusation would fall off, and he Appear too credulous against your honour. Ca. It were no treason to Castile, my Lord, If I confest this mighty fact. Ro. 'Tis justice If you doe love her honourably, to avow it. Ca. Isabella is no Angell. Ro. Nor is Clara Of an extraction to digrace a Prince. Ca. Though he be my Father, he did not Beget my Soul; who's with him? Ro. I left the Duke Mendoza. Ca. Has he made Complaint o'me? 'tis well; let me preserve Good Uncle still your loving thoughts; it is In vain to move my Father now. Ro. There is A way, if you could but dissemble, Sir, To set your wishes right, and Letters may Be so contriv'd to Portugall. Ca. The Princess Is here allready Uncle. Ro. Isabella? Ca. Now with Antonio, and I am lost. Ro. Would thou wert never to be found agen. Ca. I must doe something. Ro. The Princess thus Affronted may be worth my own ambition. Calm thoughts attend you Sir. Exit. Enter Mendoza. Me. I'm glad I came so well off from the King, His anger made me tremble, I was jealous Of more discovery, when he nam'd the Prince: This Treason is a kind of a quotidian, It leaves a man no intervall; I durst Not mention Pedro at all, for fear The King had skill in Cabala; I'm afraid There's something in the very name, that may With a small key be open'd to my danger. Ca. You are well met my Lord, doe you know me? Me. Know you Sir? yes I know you forâ Car. For what? Me. The Prince, I hope; now I'm betray'd for certain, Yet if he know it, he will not be so furious. Car. Are you so much an enemy to your self, To tell the King? Me. I tell the King? alass I dare not tell it to my Ghostly Father, I have more regard to you, and my own life, My Family's undone by it. Car. By what Sir? Me. Nay if you know not, I know not neither, Sir; What doe you mean? Car. Am not I worthy in your opinion Your Daughter Clara's love? Me. Oh, is that all? Car. But you must dote, and tell the King on't. Me. I? I disclaim it, by my life and honour. Car. I thought you had lov'd me Sir. Me. He is a Traitour That dares accuse me; now I may speak boldly; My Bloud and Fortune have a little name I'th' World, to which make an addition of My Life, my Daughter Clara too, were these In ballance against you, they would be light, And their whole loss repaird, to see you happy: If this be false, a Whirlwind snatch me Sir, And let me hang in some prodigious Cloud 'Twixt Earth and Heaven. Car. This is a bold expression. Me. But I must tell you Sir, for your own sake, I would not have you love my Daughter Clara, Were she in beauty, person, and all ornaments, Fortune and Nature could bestow, more excellent Than Isabella. Car. Why an't please your Wisedome? Me. Sir in my love to you, and Isabella, My duty to your Father, and the Kingdome, Nay for my Daughter's sake, and all my hope Of after-joyes, and for one other reason Above all these, which I conceal; yet I Complain'd not to the King. Car. Excluding me, Your Grace can be content, Don Manuel Should have your Daughter. Me. Rather than your Highness, I know a reason for't. Car. I must so too. Me. Your Grace shall pardon me at this time. Car. I wo'not Sir. Me. If you'l needs have it, I have made a vow I wo'not ask my Daughter blessing Sir; If you two meet, and marry, she may live To be a Queen, and then I'll kneel to her, Which is not in the Oath of my Allegiance. Car. The old man raves. Exit. Enter King, Maria. Me. The King. Car. He shall not see me Till I know all my fate. Exit. Ki. How doe you like the Prince Antonio? Ma. Sir, if you allow me freedomeâ Ki. You enjoy it. Ma. His Person, Bloud, and expectations, are High as the wishes of a Queen, and I With pious gratitude acknowledge all My duty, and my prayers a just return To your great care; but give me Sir your pardon, If I prefer some thoughts that prompt me to A better choyce. Ki. A better choyce? look back Upon that character your breath but now Deliver'd in his honour. Ma. I confirm it; But when you hear me humbly beg I may Perform religious duties Sir to Heaven, You wil think nature hath a place beneath 'em: If I could find any consent to marriage, Antonio would prefer himself the first To my election: but if you were pleas'dâ Ki. You would be a Nunn? Ma. That hath exprest my wishes. Ki. So I should Affront the Prince: how long Maria has This fit of your Religion held you? ha! No more, least I suspect this a pretence To hide your love plac'd otherwise unfitly, If I find where your heart is wandringâ Ma. It knows obedience better, and your name, Than to choose any path leads not to honour. Ki. I must direct it then to love Antonio. My Children are turn'd rebell. Ma. Sir I hope My offer with your leave, to dedicate My life to prayer, and Virgin-thoughts, will merit A better name. Ki. Your brother Carlo too Will find himself at loss, if he collect not Himself, and make our Royall Promise good To Isabella; while my studies are To make the Kingdome firm by our alliance With Portugall, he courts the Lady Clara. Ma. I would she were his Bride, so I had Manuel. Ki. And you at the same time, and height of both The Kingdoms expectations, would take a Cloyster, Is this to pay obedience to a Father, Whose cares have kept him wake to make you happy? Ma. Goodness forbid, that Carlo or Maria Should move me to just anger. Ki. This is virtue. Ma. He is passionate, and Love that makes all Ladies Apt and ingenious to contrive, cannot Inspire or help me with an heart to advance A little hope. Ki. It cannot be! Maria, We are surpriz'd, the Princess Isabella Is privately arriv'd, and come to Court: Where is our Son? all should prepare to meet her. Exe. Enter Carlo and Clara. Car. You may believe I trifle not. Cla. The Princess Isabella come? Car. Now if but Clara think I honour her, And instantly accept what I am willing In presence of the Priest and Heaven to give her, The Ceremony waits to make all perfect. Enter Manuell. Cla. I dare not Sir. Car. Say but you love, and that will teach you valour; I bring not onely proof of my own loyalty, Which if examin'd must invite thy faith, But thy security, a Release from Manuell; His soul is on my side, and comes to render In pity of thy wound, a balm into Thy breath; be gentle Clara. Cla. A Release? of what? Ma. Of all, thy Promise hath made mine; Observe me wisely Clara, and distinguish, As far as honour will permit, how long, And with what bleeding thoughts the Prince affects thee; For I have look'd into his soul, and back Upon the feeble merits of my self, And therefore giving thy own Vows agen, I dis-engage their strength to bind thee Clara, And to that sweetness thy first bosome had, Remit thy quiet thoughts. Car. Th'art just. Cla. Pray give Me leave to understand this mystery, To give me back all those assurances Of Love my Promise made, I'll not dispute For what unworthiness I am neglected. Ma. I dare not be so impious. Cla. Then here I take My liberty again. Ma. You have it. Cla. Now I with safety of my honor, may Choose where I please. Ma. You may. Cla. And you desire it; You have power I must confess to give me from you Into my own possession, but no title Now to direct my heart, then though I meet My own despair, here I give Clara back, And with new Vows as strong as my Religion, And Love can make, contract my self agen To Death, or Manuell. Car. A Conspiracy! Cla. I have resign'd no interest in him, And by new choyceâam not my own agen. Car. So, so, it is as possible in our destinies We should enjoy her both, as live together, When Clara is thy Bride. Cla. That sound was tragicall; Oh call those fatall words agen, and think That if with safety of my faith I cannot Meet your desires allready, you will force My soul to greater distance, by destroying What most I love; I know you doe but fright me. Ma. If I be mark'd for your revenge, I dare not Think you will stain your honour, to contrive My death ignobly. [They whisper. Cl. What was that he mention'd? Sir, by your name and blood I charge you hear me, By these (your rage compels) a Virgins tears, I can kneel too, take your revenge on me, 'Tis I that have offended, for your sake He did return the interest I gave him, But 'twas not in his power to revoke Himself made mine, nor darc I quit possession. Car. I have but tryed thy virtue, Manuel And I are friends. Cl. That was a heavenly language. Car. Our swords shall serve to nobler uses, Clara, I'll not disturb the progress of your Mariage; And since I see you're fixt so gloriously, Proceed to your own Hymen, I'll attend you, And witness all your holy rites. Cl. Blest change! What prayers and duty can reward his goodness? Car. I hope you'll not deny for my past service, Madam, your smile upon me, which shall be A triumph after all my wounds receiv'd, And boast a glory next to be your husband; For I consider now I am unfit. Farewell, we may salute. Remember, Manuel, The time and place. Exit. Cla. What was it the Prince whisper'd? Ma. Nothing, Madam, To fright your cheek to paleness. Cl. I do tremble. Ma. Were all this reconcilement a disguise, And that he meant revenge, should time and place Fit his intents, and I should meet his anger, At this secure thy peace, his honor will Not let him wound me basely, and when I Lift up a sword 'gainst him, fate let me dye.

My Lord is coming to my chamber, he Has been with the King, I see my self allready Knight of the order of the Calatrava, And my Commission sign'd for the State Secretary. I am not the first servant of the Court Has kept his Lord in aw; these Secrets are An excellent curb to ride a Statesman with, That is not come to the art of poysoning. I know he wishes heartily I were hang'd; I tryed him once for the wars; to find his pulse, And I was listed Captain, before some The Generall knew had been seven years in service (As Ushers to right honourable Ladies) There was his Graces commendations To a Field-officer, that should drill me out, The first to dye, with honor on some on-slaught; So quitted that preferment. Enter Mendoza. He is come; I'll take no notice. Men. If he liv'd at the t'other end of th'world, He might betray me in the next packet: Ha! Pe. Item I bequeathâ Me. What art thou doing? Pe. Only making up my Will, Sir; and my self Ready for the Indies; 'tis a long voyage, And therefore I would settle every thing Before I go; if your Grace please to honor me, I would make you my Executor. Me. But when, Will you dye Pedro? ha? Pe. Sir, there be storms, Abroad, and who does know how soon the waves May rore, and crack the cabins? Me. Ha! Pe. There may be Calentures, my Lord, and twenty Devices to be met at sea, beside The land diseases; there be Hericanoes Are boysterous enough to tear up mountains, And strike a ship clean through o't'other side To the Antipodes. Me. He deals with the devil, and knows my thoughts. There's no hast to make your will, I have Consider'd o'the business, and truth is, I cannot find my heart willing to part with thee, So far thou hast been faithfull; we will live And dye together. Pe. By no means, my Lord: I am resolv'd I will not live in Spain A moneth, for as much plate as the next Fleet Brings home; no, I beseech your Grace excuse me. Me. Why Pedro? Pe. If your Grace please I shall be Knighted, Or have the Office you have promis'd, do't, And do't betime, it will be worse for both else. Me. You do not threaten to reveal the business? Pe. 'Lass, there be other matters, Sir, as dangerous, And if you love your self, or honor, finishâ I cannot help it. Me. I am all a bath! Pedro, why dost thou fright me so? if thou Beest honest, ther's no mortal can betray us. Pe. Worse, worse than that; let me go travel, Sir, And far enough; it is not possible That I should stay, and you preserve your wits. Me. The reason? Pe. It will make you mad to hear it, Sir, But 'tis my desperate fate, the stars command it; Would I had never seenâ Me. What? Pe. A face that I could name. Me. If it concerns not The other mystery, let me hear it, Pedro, I will be arm'd. Pe. Why then you'll cut my throat; You cannot hold your hand; pray let me go, And you may save all yet. Me.

It will be safer, Sir, to hoyst sayls yet, No matter whither, So I never come Agen; for if I see one face too often, Both you, and I, and she's undone: I have Beaten my self allready, fasted, prayed, Been drunk, and pray'd agen, nothing will kill Concupiscenceâoh Sir. Me. Why, this is raving. Pe. I, you may call it what you please, but here She lies a cross that must, or doe the deed, Or make poor Pedro miserable. Me. How he sweats?

I told you this afore, but do not do't, Sir, now, I rather look for't in the next sallad, Or in my mornings draught; there's spice i' your closet; Or we have Spanish figs. Me. Thou most unheard-of impudence! how can'st hope I should not cut thy head off? sirrah, rascall. Pe. To these things humane nature has been prone; But if you kill me, Sir, there is a scedule, A Secret in a bag of writings, left In a friends handânay I did look for this, There is an Inventory of Goods were stoln; The Anno Domini, with Ãtatis suÃ¦ Set down, the day o'th' moneth, and place remembred, If these do not revenge my deathâ Me. Whyso; a pox upon theeâyet come hither, And let me cut thy tongue out. Pe. I confess I am not fit to marry, Sir, a Lady of Her Princely birth and fortune, all consider'd; Alas, I know I am a wrethâbutâ Me. Thou wouldst have her to be thy whore, &amp; me Thy pander to speak for theeârogue, devill, I must kill thee, there is no remedy. Pe. Hold, you mistake me, Sir, 'tis no such business. Me. What wouldst thou have then? Pe. I would go beyond sea, I, to the Indies, Sir, Or turn a Haddack by the way; send me To the new Islands, or Japan. Me. From whence you may send Letters to the King; No sirrah, I'll not trust you. Pe. 'Tis a hard case, my Lord, I have dangerous sailing Betwixt your Graces Scylla and her Caribdis. Me. I dare not kil him; why do I not kil my self then? No, I wo'not, I will talk reason to him; Come hither sirra, my tormentor. Pe. I Sirâ Me. If your hot blood must have a cooler, will None serve your rogues turn, but my daughter Clara? Say thou art madâ Pe. I have too many senses. Me. Or if your wantonness must be confin'd Within my wallsâ Pe. The more my sorrowâbut I'll try my Lord, If you will give me leave, for your sake, Sir, Among her Gentlewomen, what I can do To conjure down my devil, I will take Some physick too, Sir, every thing will help; Would I were whipt, my Lordâ Me. Whipt with a vengeance? Pe. But I am griev'd For your vexation, and my scurvey fortune; But if there be a wench, a witch, a medicine Above ground, that can give me any charm, Your Grace shall hear no more on'tâSo, your pardon. And now my Lord, let your unworthy servant Have leave to ask one question; does not your Grace Suspect me monstrously? nay d'ee not think I do presume too much upon your fears? And that the knowledge of this Secret makes Me bold and sawcy, my good Lord? Me. 'Tis all too true, but 'tis not in my brain To help't, unless I take some course to kill thee. Pe. How? Me. I fear I shall be driven to't; one fit Like this will work my impatience up: look to't. Pe. Why, then I'll tel your Grace an easie way To remove all your jealousie, and never Trouble your brain with study how to kil me, A most compendious way. Me. I would I knew it. Pe. 'Tis but my going to the Court, my Lord, And if you be not cur'd within an hour After I have told the King a story, how Your wife the Dutchess lostâI ha' doneâ Fear nothing. Enter Lord. Lo. Is not Prince Carlo here? Me. Not here, my Lord. Lo. 'Tis the Kings pleasure you attend him presently, Your daughters presence is expected too Among the Ladies, for the entertainment Of Princess Isabella, new arriv'd the Court. Me. We humbly wait to kiss his hand. Pe. Shall I attend? Me. I am resolv'd now not to sleep without thee, And in the day, I'll look upon thee, Pedro, As thou wert my great Seal, and I thy keeper. Pe. Yet I may give you a slip. Me. We'll to Clara: The Princess Isabella come so private, ha! Pedro? Pe. I am here, my Lord. Exeunt Enter Manuel. Ma. This is the place by his commands to meet in; It has a sad and fatall invitation. A Hermit that forsakes the world for prayer, And solitude, would be timorous to live here. There's not a spray for birds to perch upon; For every tree that over-looks the vale, Carries the mark of lightning, and is blasted. The day which smil'd as I came forth, and spread Fair beams about, has taken a deep melancholy, That fits more ominons in her face than night; All darkness is less horrid than half light. Never was such a scene for death presented, And there's a ragged mountain peeping over With many heads, seeming to crowd themselves Spectators of some Tragedy; but I'll Prevent 'em all; though my obedience Instructed me to wait here, it shall not Be brib'd to draw my sword against the Prince; And in his honor I am safe, how e'r This sense of Clara's loss transport him, 'tis not Within his nature to be impious. And if I gain his friendship, I return With triumph to my Clara. Within âhelp, help. Enter Prince Carlo's Page. Pa. Oh help, Don Manuel, help for heavens sake. Ma. Celio the Princes page? where is the Prince? Pa. Oh Sir, I fear he's slain. Ma. By whom? Pa. The Devill, or one not very much unlike him, A More, that basely set upon him, sure He has dispatcht the Prince, he persues me, And if he have, Death shall be welcome to me, For I am not fit to live, and lose my Master. He's here, and his sword bloudy. Enter Carlo like a More. Ma. Villain! were all thy bloud rivers of balm, Or such a floud as would restore a life To the departed World, it should be all A sacrifice to Carlo. (They fight.) Pa. Hold, hold Don Manuell. Ma. Canst thou be mercifull to the Princes Murderer? Pa. Curse on my Duty to obey so far. My Lord, the Prince is slain, you are wounded too. Ma. The Prince! Car. Don Manuell, I forgive thee. Ma. Pray Heaven this be a Dream; for if my hand Have been so much a Traitour, it shall call No other aid in your revenge: Are you Prince Carlo? Car. I was. Ma. That voyce shall be my sentence. Car. Hold, I charge thee by thy honour, Manuell. Ma. Why did you wear this black upon you Sir? Or how could art of man contrive a Cloud Which this Soul had no eyes to penetrate? Car. I knew thou wouldst not fight against me knowingly, And if I fell, I meant it to secure Thy act from punishment, when in this darkness I took my leave o'th' World, onely that boy, Whom I compel'd to feign me wounded, so To make thee draw thy sword; but with my bloud I feel my spirits vanish, if I have But breath enough, I send by thee a kiss To thy own Clara now. Ma. Oh, help good boy! For 'tis no time to curse thee now, my horse Is not far off, this scarf may stay his bleeding Untill we meet with better Surgerie. Now Heaven reprieve my strength but to convey him To some good place, and I resign my self To all the justice you will call me to. Exit. Enter King, Mendoza, Roderigo, Antonio, Pedro, Lord. Ki. Y'are all but my tormentors; where's Piracquo? Enter Piracquo. Ro. His son is absent too. Pir. Have comfort Sir. An. Our neglect is lost in the Generall Cause, What doe you think my Lord Mendoza? Men. This no news of the Prince is not so comfortable. Enter 1 Lord. Ki. The news you bring? Lo. Unless he had left the Kingdomâ Ki. Be dumbâand he had left the World Your cares might have persued him; if he Return not, you have murdred him. Ro. My Stars are now At work in Heaven, their influence is powerful, I will adore the Sun if it dissolve not This mist in which the Prince is lost; I am Content thou be a Constellation Carlo, In any Sphere but this. Enter a Messenger with a Letter to Piracquo. Pir. To me? 'tis Manuel's character. Lo. Unless we hear some good news of the Prince, I fear we lose the King too. An. 'Tis strange none should attend him but his Page. Ro. I fear some plot is practis'd 'gainst his life, But dare not speak. 2 Lo. That's it distracts the King, Whose fears are helpt by a sad dream he had Last night. Ro. My Lord Piracquo's son is missing too. Pi. Comfort your self till my return, I'll find 'em, or ne'r see your face agen. Ki. Well said Piracquo, all my prayers go with thee. Me. Pedro. Exit Pir. Pe. My Lord. Me. I know not what to say, but stand Before, they may not see me weep. Pe. Sir, I must confessâ Me. Ha! Confess? Pe. You are still suspicious, have a true heart, And let your conscience look less abroad Sir, If he be dead, your trouble's over Sir; We must all dye, Death has his severall waies And times to take us off, some expire humbly I'th' Cradle, some dismist upon a Scaffoldâ Enter Isabella, Maria, Clara. Me. Come hither, doe not name a Scaffold, I Was innocent thou knowst, the plot was all My Ladies, and not one survives the Secret, But we two. Pe. Keep your own counsell Sir, This Fatherly affection may doe harm, He could not dye in better time, Ki. Madam, can you, Whose honour seems to suffer by this absence, Have so much charity to comfort me? Isa. He is not desperate, while we have hope. My Lord Piracquo's son may wait upon him. Enter Manuell. An. Don Manuell. Ki. Hast brought news of my Son? Ma. I can inform you a sad story Sir. Isa. Where is the Prince? Ma. Not dead I hope. Ki. Hast thou a jealousie will concern that fear? My soul has been a Prophet: what misfortune? Ma. If you have strength to hear a truth So sad, he has been wounded. Ex. Ladies. Ki. By what Traitour? look to the Princess. Ma. I had not with such boldness undertook The Tragick Story, if I had not brought The great Offender. Ki. Oh, welcome Manuellâwhere's the Body? Ma. Where it doth want no Surgery, but my Father Is gone with all the wings his fear and duty Can aid him with, at his return to acquaint you With Carlo's life, or death. Ro. Would I were his Surgeon. Ki. Thou hast not nam'd the Villain yet, he may Escape. Ma. I have took order for his stay, Untill your anger and the Laws conclude him. Ki. Thou hast done us service. Ma. And it will sink by slow degrees into Your faith, that he, who gave him all his wounds, Was one that lov'd him faithfully. An. Lov'd him? Ma. Above his own life. Ro. Torments oretake the Traitour. Ma. 'Tis not well said, with pardon of the King; When I shall bring you to the weeping heart Of this poor man, some may allow his penitence, So great, it may invite a mercy to him; Alass, he was betray'd to the black deed, Both sword and soul compell'd to't. Ki. Here's a prodigie! Ro. Are you acquainted with the guilty person, That you dare thus extenuate his fact? Ma. I am, and dare produce himâhere he stands, So far from wishes to out-live the Prince, He begs to wait upon his Shade. An. Does he not bleed? Ki. Apprehend his person. Ma. They are but churlish drops, And know not their own happiness; this wound Was made by Carlo, yet how slow it weeps To answer his effusion? could I reach Their orifice, I'd kiss the crimson lips, For his dear name that made 'em. Men. Did he kill him? Justice Sir, Justice! I beg for Justice Upon this Murderer. Pe. Now it works. Ki. You? by what nearer interest in Carlo Should you imagine we are slow to punish him? 'Twas a black hour when Carlo saw thee first, Rewarded now for all his love; to prison with him, And let him see no day. Ex. guarded. Ma. I kiss your Sentence. An. This circumstance is strange, I am not satisfied. Ex. Ant. after Manuell. Enter Clara. Ki. How is the Princess? Cl. Sir she is alive, And would be glad to hear the Prince were so. Ki. We cannot promise, Clara. Roderigo, We should be satisfied where his Body is, For 'tis without a Soul, I fear, by this time. Ro. I could instruct the Surgeon a way To make that sure. [To Clara.] Me. And Manuell hath confess'd himself the Murderer. Pe. This change was unexpected. Cla. Is he gone to Prison then? Me. Go home, by that time thou Hast wept out all thy tears, I'll come, and tell thee A little sad tale Clara, that shall make An end, and we will break our hearts together. Ki. Mendoza? Me. Sir. Ki. Why does thy grief appear So rude to out-swell mine? he was my Son. Me. My tears are anger Sir, as well as grief, That he that did commit this Paricide, Should be so impudent to say he lov'd him. Ki. That amazes me. Me. But Traitours have their Gloss, And dare expound their disobedient acts, A branch of their allegiance: precious juggling! Treason would be too ugly to appear With his own face, but Duty and Religion Are hansome visors to abuse weak sight, That cannot penetrate beyond the bark, And false complexion of things; I hope You wo'not think a single death sufficient, If Julio dye. Ki. Carlo thou meanstâ Me. I, I, the Prince, I know not what I say Sir, Things make me wildâ Pe. Take heed Sir what you say. Enter Antonio, Roderigo at one dore, and at the other dore Piracquo, and a Lord discoursing. Piracquo is return'd. Pi. My son confess the deed, and sent to Prison? so. Ki. Now Sir. An. How is the Prince, my Lord? Pi. This was an act of his last strength, as when A short-liv'd Taper makes a blaze, it has Direction to your Sister Sir, and I His last commands I fearâ [Pir. gives Ant. a Letter. An. For the conveyance, Trust that to meâgive this Sir to my Sister. [To his Servant. Ki. Then he is dead, Piracquo? Pi. Not yet Sir, But he hath such a wound will not allow Him many minutes life, 'tis mortall Sir, They say, and wo'not pain him past next dressing. Ro. How things succeed to my AmbitionâSirâ Me. I care not for my head, now let him take it, 'Tis but for keeping counsell. Ro. It is apparent this misfurtune grew From both their loves to Clara. Ki. Thy son, Piracquo, dyes. Pi. Great Sir, hear me. An. Manuell affirms he did not know the Prince I'th' habit of a More, and that his Page By the command of Carlo told him, that His Master had been wounded by that More, To engage their fight. Pi. All this the Prince acknowledg'd. Ro. These are devices to paint Manuel's Treason. Pi. I sooner dare believe one accent from The Prince's breath, when his just soul was parting, Than all your Commentaries; I am bold; Nor can the Law, and all your anger weigh So heavy as my curse, upon his head That durst lift up a Sword to wound the Prince: But let not passion take away your justice, 'Tis that I kneel for. Ki. Against whom Piracquo? Pi. 'gainst him that's guilty of the Prince's loss, You may incline to think poor Manuell innocent. Ki. What riddle's this? Ro. Has not your son, Piracquo, Confess'd himself the Murderer? An. Manuel's fortune Distracts the old man. Pi. Pardon my love of truth, I here accuse Mendoza, that hath slept so long in Treason. Me. HaâPeâPedro. Pi. If he deny, I ha' proof to make him blush, And sink him with dishonour; Pedro can Relate a Story will be worth your wonder. Me. Nay then 'tis come about, I see, I cannot Sir confess in better time. Don Manuel has accus'd himself unjustly For Carlo's death, that Prince, if I may trust A Wife upon her death-bedâ Enter Isabella. Ki. Roderigoâ Give us account from their examination, And guide us in this Labyrinth. Piracquo Return to th'Prince, what Death hath left of him Command may be attended hither. Isa. Sir, if you please, I have a great desire To take a sad leave of the Prince, and kiss His pale hand, ere his Body be embalm'd, And sear-cloths hide him from us. Ki. It will but Enlarge your grief. An. I will attend my Sister; my Lord Piracquo You can best direct us. (Exe. Ant. Pir. Isa. Men. and Ped. under guard. Ro. Convey 'em with a strong guard. Pe. What think you of an Indian voyage now Sir? Ro. My joyes are firm at root, Don Manuel, Sir, is not guilty of the Prince's death, Yet stain'd with blood to merit execution. He that is slain did but usurp your blessing, And was by the art of Duke Mendoza's Lady, Then Governess to the Prince, after the loss Of Carlo, that was stoln away an infant, Put in his place; the Court has been long cosen'd. Ki. This story will want faith. Me. The circumstance will make all clear. Ki. Expound the riddle as we walk, there's no Condition more expos'd to care than Princes. Private men meet the force of common stings, But none can feel the weight of Kings, but Kings. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. V. Enter Mendoza, and the Castellano. Me. A very goodly pile; a hansom prison! Ca. It has been grac'd with persons of some honor. Me. They had but little grace, as well as I, That came to be your Tenants for all that. Signior, where is my quondam servant? My fellow prisoner, Pedro. Ca. He is singing, Sir. Me. What? Ca. Catches. Me. He has a fine time on't. He need not clear his throat for a confession, He has done that already, and I too; That trouble's over; and yet call him hither; But I'll not sing. Poor Julio, thou art gone, And with thy eyes all my delights are clos'd, My senses vanish too apaceâI was Too hasty when my Dutchess lay a dying To visit her; had I but stayd one hour, She had been speechless, and I had been happy Without the reach of this unlucky Secret. Enter Castellano and Pedro. Pe. Does the house fill, Sir? these are active times, And if all men had their deserts, the State Must be at charge to build new tenements For Traytors. Ca. The times are busie, Sir. Pe. They are indeed, Good for al squires of the delinquent body And sable Twig. Ca. You are very pleasant, Sir. Pe. You would not smile, I think, so much, if Justice Should take a toy and turn about, it is Within the hand of fate to fetch a compass, With your own rod, &amp; whip, you know what follows. Me. Is this a time and place convenient, Pedro, To sing your catches? Ex. Cast. Pe. Yes, and please your Grace. And cause my songs are set for three parts, Sir, If it will please your Grace to take the Tenor, And get the Prince's Page, newly committed, To sing the Treble, for the Base, let me alone. Me. You can sing that part at first sight. Pe. I can reach double ef-fa-uth: Shall the boy come? Me. Yes, yes, why should I grieve? Pe. Why now you are right; Let men that have no hope to get their freedom Be sullen, whine like whelps, and break thelr sleep, We must be jolly, and drink sack, and sing. Me. We? why we? is any thing in our condition Can promise hope to be enlarg'd before The rest? our state, if you consider, Pedro, Exceeds, in being desperate, other mens, As we out-sin them in the fact. Pe. Why, there's your error, we are in for Treason, Sir, That's to our comfort. Me. Comfort? can there be A greater charge? Pe. Oh our discharge the nearer; Poor things, whose highest thoughts are pilfering, Lye by't, and languish Sessions after Sessions, Till they have worn away their clothes, and skins too, And often are repriev'd, when he that's sent Hitherfor Treason, quickly comes to th'bar, Pleads his not guilty, and is hang'd compendiously. Me. Yet some, with reverence to your observations, Are not dispatcht. Pe. Then, doubt their causes mainly; Your Grace, I hope, shall not complain for want Of timely execution; I am thinking What Speech is best to please the people at it. Me. I shall have cause to name your treachery. Pe. Why so, there's more argument by that To stuff out your confession. Me. Tell me, and tell me truly, How long since you discover'd this Court Secret To Don Piracquo? Pe. I was tender hearted, Sir, And knew that I had but a weak memory, Therefore the first time that I saw his Lordship, After he came from Portugal, I told him The punctual story, lest I should forget, Sir; What should a man dissemble, &amp; lose time for? I did it for your good. Me. It does appear. Pe. It was no fault of mine, you came no sooner To this preferment. Me. It might have sav'd my Julio's life indeed, And then though I had dyedâ Pe. Yet you were against it still; These jealousies and fears do seldom prosper; I knew by instinct t'were better, but as it is 'Tis well, your death will be more pittied, And remarkable. Me. But what have you got by betraying me? Pe. The credit to be hang'd for treason, as I told your Grace, besides the benefit Of being read in Chronicles with Lords, And men of worship, I have prepar'd a business, For the present, a provision, Sir, Will serve any turn. Me. What's that? Pe. A ballad, Sir, Before I dye, to let the people know How I behav'd my self upon the scaffold; With other passages, that will delight The people, when I take my leave of the world, Made to a Pavin tune, Will you hear it? Enter Castell. and Clara. Me. Away you knave. Cast. Sir, your Daughter. Pe. She comes to condole. I'll see you another time; your Graces servant. Ex. Cl. Sir, I beseech you tell me; for I dare not Believe the busie noise, they say you have Confest strange things, and he that was receiv'd These many years, Prince Carlo, and so lately Slain, is my brother Julio. Me. Sad truth, Clara. Cl. I have heard my Mother say, he dyed an infant. Me. And I believ'd it too, but at her death She told me another story, Clara, that Prince Carlo by some Pirats had been stoln An infant from our Castle, on which loss, She sent me word to Court, my son dyed suddenly; At which the King fearing some danger might Follow to the Prince her charge, commanded him To court, instead of whom, she sent thy brother, Who was believ'd the Kingdoms heir, untill Pedro, who waited then nearest thy Mother, And knew the imposture, brake his oath, and told Piracquo all the Secret, by whose charge My death and shame must make up the full Tragedy. Cla. Manuel kill'd my brother then? Me. He has don't; And if thou hast a Sister's soul, thou must Joyn with thy father, to pull curses on him. Cl. That wil not call poor Julio back again; They say that Charity will open Heaven. Me. Charity? will you not curse your brother's murderer? Upon my blessing I command thee curse him. Cl. That would but wound us more, &amp; not reach him; Beside, 'twere an intrenchment upon heaven, So boldly to prescribe our own revenge, It were a sin might draw another punishment, Great as the loss of you. Me. You are a baggage; But if thou hast a thought to wish him live, Here I disclame thee; if thou wert a son, I would pronounce thee bastard, if thou didst not Kill himself thy self, but as it is, I sha'not Be satisfied, since my own hands are bound, If thou attempt not something in his danger. Cl. Good Sir, you speak, as you were to expect No killing sentence from the offended Law. Me. I'll study some revenge my self. Exit. Cl. He's lost; And in this storm like a distracted passenger, Whose bark has struck upon some sand, I look From the forsaken deck upon the seas, I find my own despair, which every wave Swels high, and bids me die for fear of drowning. Enter Castellano. May I not see Don Manuel your prisoner? Ca. Yes Madam, if you expect untill Princess Maria, who is come to visit himâ Cl. My affairs concern 'em both, Direct me with more hast. Ca. Then this way, Madam. Exe. Enter Manuel and Maria, (a Taper on the Table.) Ma. Madam, I ow to your charity this light, And yet this little Taper may be useless, I fear the King will lose part of his sentence When you go hence, for such a full light waits About you, when you take away your person, It will be some day still, as I foresee As you appear'd some dawning of the morning. Ma. I would I could bring comfort to thee, Manuel. Man. What comfort can you wish me? Ma. Life and liberty; With these my self, if fate, and thy consent Were to allow the gift. Man. It is not well, Unless you doubted, Madam, my repentance, To afflict me with these mockeries. When will you rather perfect what your own Revenge must prompt you to, my death for Carlo, Your Princely Brother, Madam? I confess This hand rob'd him of life. Ma. Yet in my heart I dare pronounce thy pardon, Manuel. Man. It is not possible. Enter Clara. Is not that Clara? That's come to take her leave, before I print My everlasting farewell on her lip? Which I shall hardly find, if this rain last, To drown these lovely meadows; thou shalt be A Judge between the Princess and poor Manuel, To enable thee for sentence, take upon thee Her person, Clara; Be the Princess, wo't? And hear me plead against my self and her, Till she repent her love, and leave me to A quiet death. I know not how to think (Maria) you can mean this love to me, Or that your voice, when it does chime the sweetest, Is more than preface to my dirge; say that You have a heart less penetrable than The scale of Dragons, and as many stings When they make war, and I'll give faith to you; For such an enemie as I, must not Be look'd on, but with all your wrath upon me; Me-thinks I hear your brother call you, Madam, And hovering, as he scorn'd to touch the earth Sustains his Murderer, is pointing to The wounds I made, whose fountains are still weeping. I feel a purple dew descend upon me, And I am all a bloody rock allready; Are not you stiff with wonder yet? if once You had when I appear'd a man, fair thoughts Of me; it is too much to love me now, You must convert them into curses, Madam, And I will call it justice. Cla. I came not To hear this Comment on my brother's story, Whom you have kill'd. Man. Observe her act your person, And speak now, as if the sorrow were her own, And she had lost a brother. Cl. Indeed, I have wept before, and came not now to learn A grief for him that was so near my blood: But I've consider'd too, the ties of nature Should have no force against the rules of Justice; Allthough it be a sorrow, to remember He took his great misfortune from your sword, You did not murder him, nay you did not kill him, You fought in his revenge, and while he came Hid in the name and person of a Traytor, It was your virtue made him bleed, and yet He was my brother, Sir. Man. Your brother? more, He was your Prince too, Madam, think o'that, The full blown expectation of the Kingdom, One that redeem'd my life from banishment, And yet I kill'd him, can you forgive me? You cannot, must not, Madam. Cla. Yes, and dare Say, I still love you. Man. She will punish me, For giving up my interest to Carlo, If she encourage thus Maria, Madam, Do you consider how few sands are left In my poor glass of time, I cannot promise Three minutes here, Law and the Kings decree Have turn'd two parts of me to dust allready; I feel the third unsettle, and make fit To be dissolv'd, but could fate give my life The period to be wished (remember whom I speak to Clara) and I need no more Accuse my self, my heart was long since given Away, and you as soon may reconcile Time and Eternity to one growth, and age, As hope my love and yours should ever meet. Cla. Then it is time to dye. Man. Madam, she faints, Oh help, she has forgot her part, this was Not meant to Clara. Mar. Madam, Madam. Man. Clara, so, so, she returns, I should have quickly followed else. Mar. I see Your loves are sacred, and 'tis sin to attempt Your separation; though I lov'd thee Manuel, I can resign to Clara, whom I hop'd Her Brothers death might have provok'd to leave thee. Man. Her Brothers? let me hear Clara speak; her Brothers death? Having so little time to stay with thee Alive, why didst thou make such hast? Cla. Did not You Sir pronounce it was impossible That our two loves should meet? Man. Thou didst not Represent Clara then, thou wert the Princess. Cla. I know not, but your last profession That our two hearts should never grow together, Followed so close my Brother's death, I thought The meaning look'd on me. Man. Thy Brothers death? Mar. You have not slain the Prince my Brother, Manuel, But Clara's, this may yet appear a mystery. Cla. 'Tis too true. Man. But stay; and can my Clara then forgive me? No man despair to find Mercy in Heaven, There is so great a Charity upon Earth. But doe not leave me lost i'th' wonder, Madam, Allthough it would be happiness to know The Prince not dead, I cannot hear without A wound next his, that I ha' kil'd thy Brother; It cannot be, allthough thou wouldst forgive me, I cannot be so miserable. Mar. How Their Souls agree? 'twere tyranny to part 'em. Clara, I envyed, now allow thy happiness, And will have no more thoughts upon your loves, But what shall be employ'd in hearty wishes That Manuel may live still to reward it; Thou hast deserv'd him better than I have Antonio. Cla. If my death may speak Addition to the love I owe thee; 'tis In my resolution, at that minute Thy Soul takes leave, my own shall wait upon it, And take a journey through the Clouds together: Who knows but they may fill one Star? Farewell, Till we begin that progress. Man. Doe not make Death horrid to me Clara, for to think, When this unworthy Frame must fall to pieces, Thy Soul, a fairer Tenant to this building, Should wander in persuit of mineâ Mar. No more; Let me advise your griefs, I have tears for both, Divide at distance, you may kiss in heart. Man. With such a groan souls from their bodie part The Castellano lights away the Ladies, and Manuell retires to his Prison. Enter Roderigo and Isabella. Isa. How, an Impostor! though the Peoples tongues, That catch at every noise, and wave their duty, As they are prescrib'd by Faction, or lewd Pamphlets, Doe talk this loudâ Rod. Upon my honour, Madam. Isa. I hope your Lordship has another knowledge, And faith, than to disgrace your bloud, the Princeâ Ro. I say he is no Prince, and we are sorry A Lady of your greatness should i'th' height Of such a glorious expectation, lose What did invite your person hither. Isa. Ha! Then I am lost, that Letter has undone me, Which full of love and satisfaction, made Me hasty to destroy my self. Ro. 'Tis yet Within your choice to lose no honour, Madam, And in my sense of what you else might suffer, I come to tender reparation, Both to your love and greatness. Isa. 'Tis not possible. Ro. If you can find within your heart a will To entertain my love, I'm no Impostor, The King will call me Brother, be kind Madam, And what is past shall vanish like a dream. Secure me with a smile. Isa. My Lord, I thank you; But there will still remain some characters By which the world may guess at my sad story. Ro. There cannot. Isa. Yes, I find some printed here, For I did love the person, I confess, Of him you call the Impostor: did he know Himself a Counterfeit? Ro. Let me be just, And quit him from that Treason. Isa. That is something To plead his innocence to me; I dare not Yet ask his name, when I remember what My tongue consented to before the Priest So late; yet 'twill be known; if he be not The Prince we thought, tel me his other name; Say, is he basely born? Ro. He is the Duke Mendoza's son. Isa. That is a comfort yet, And in the confidence of this truth, my Lord, I am well again, I thank you. Ro. If this please you, Doe you remember Madam, he hath wounds Fatall upon him, that allready may Exclude him from the living? Isa. 'Twould be impious, While there is any life remaining Sir, To make another promise; when you say He's dead, I may with modest freedom hear What you too early now prepare me for. Exit Isa. Ro. You honour me enough. I find her judgement Allready meet what I propound, he cannot, He sha'not live to cross me. Enter Piracquo. 'Tis Piracquo, He can assure me; you look sad my Lord, As if with Julio's giving up the ghost, Your sons life now were forfeit. Pir. 'Tis too true. Ro. I'll follow, and acquaint her; yet 'tis safer She take it from another. Pir. All my hopes Are in your Grace, the King is coming hither, If you will bind an old mans prayers, and service, Second my feeble breath, and mediate His mercy to my boy, you may be satisfied In conscience, he had no thoughts to kill him; The Prince's death will not engage you now To be poor Manuel's enemy; good my Lord, Forgive what past in my rash language. Ro. Does not Your Lordship call to mind there was a sum Of fifty thousand Ducats? Pi. They shall be sent to your Grace's Secretary, nay, I'll make 'em fifty thousand more, and think It cheap to save his life, now you are mercifullâ Ro. The bargain would doe well, but you are cozen'd, I will not take a Maravide, not I, If upon other honourable tearms I may possess you favour, I shall meet Your just commands; ha' you forgot my Lord? Some men doe keep Records, but I am charitable, And will not rack your patienceâ Pi. Y'are gratious. Ro. Ten millions of Ducats shall not ransome Your Darling from the Scaffold: you observe? You know your self, your fortune, and upon What strength you must depend, now I have saidâ Pi. Will your Grace hear? My son shall live then, and not lose one hair, If you would pawn your soul to have it otherwise. I have said too. Ro. So peremptory? Pi. Your Grace must pardon me the truth, I have A scurvy sullen humour where I meet A worse, and cannot hold, though I should hang for't, And so God bu'y to your Grace, we are aloneâ Ro. Be merry with your head onâtime may comeâ Pi. I would take boldness, once more, to intreat That the young man may live till the next Spring, And then your Grace may purgeâ Ro. So Sir, I shall find waies to stay your vomitingâ The King. Enter King and Lords. 1. Lo. Good Sir be comforted. Ki. Good Sir give me reasons; I had a son till now, yet long since lost him. Ro. Now you may take revenge. Ki. Tis well remembred. Mendoza is the Traytor, he shall bleed For Carlo's loss. Ro. And he deserves, that would Have cozen'd the whole Kingdom. Ki. Send for him; I'll ask him in what wilderness the boy Has hid himself, command him hither presently, And if he give me not a satisfaction, It will be justice then to send his soul About the world, to find him out. 1. Lo. The Prince Antonio, Sir. Enter Antonio and Maria. An. If at a time, when sorrow Hath exercised his sting, you can admit To hear me happy in Maria's love, Let me begin to call you father, and Till Carlo find your blessing, think you have One to supply his duty. Ki. It is some Allay to Carlo's loss, Maria has Not left her father. Ma. I shall ever live Within your precept to express a daughter As unto him a wife. Ki. Both to my heart! Sit down, where is your sister Isabella? Ro. She not despairs To be a Bride to one, that may repair My Nephews loss; and if she smile on me, It wil not draw I hope your frown upon it. Enter Isabella, Julio, Piracquo. An. Is not that Isabella? Isa. And this he, Who, if you call me Sister, must be worth Your noblest Friendship, and embrace. Ro. Alive? Ju. Your pardon Sir, they knew me innocent, Made me usurp Prince Carlo's name for Julio's. Ro. Confusion! Enter Manuel and Clara. Pi. I appeal Sir to your justice, and have brought My son, to hear your breath pronounce his pardon. Ki. Thus all meet happiness but I; receive Him free Piracquo, onely I must mourn The loss of mine. Enter Mendoza and Pedro. Ju. I am no Prince, Don Manuel, my fate Has been unriddled. Cla. My Brother living? we are all safe. Me. Ha! my Julio? Ju. Your blessing now. Me. Take it, and with it all my tears, I scorn To shed one other drop, my joyes are mighty, My heart is all one bonefireâ Ki. Plead no more, Mendoza dies, the sentence is irrevocable. Pe. There is a cooler Sir after your bonefire. Ju. Sister, I'll kiss these sorrows off. Cl. You cannot while my Father's doom'd to death. Ro. Why does Mendoza live? Pi. Because he must not dye yet. Pedroâ Pe. My Lord. [Pi. and Pe. whisper with the King. Men. I'll give thee Clara first, here take her Manuel, I see she loves thee, lose no tears for me, My Taper has burnt dim this many years. Ki. Antonio! Maria! Isabella! Mendoza! witness allâproceed Piracquoâ Pi. I was that Pirat Sir, that stole your son, And being desperate meant by this surprise To make my peaceâ Pe. I was in the Confederacy, And must affirm this truth. Pi. But just when I had fitted my design, And did expect t'have brought Don Carlo home, I heard he was at Court, no loss deplor'd, For by the Dutchess of Mendoza's art Julio supply'd the Princes name, and person. Me. And sent me word to Court my Son was dead? ha! Pi. This made me think my Kinsman had deceiv'd me, And then resolv'd my stay in Portugal, Where, as my own, I bred, and call'd him Manuel; Till after many years your Grace redeem'd us, And I at my return confirm'd i'th' story By Pedro, hitherto protracted time, With hope to serve Don Julio for our freedome. I have your pardon Sir for all. Ki. Thou hast. Pe. I am included, trust me with a Secret Sir Another time, I knew 'twould come to this At last, and with some justice did but punish Your fears and jealousies; is not this better Than sending me to the Wars, or shipping me For t'other World before my time? Me. Th'art my best Servant. Pi. And my heir agen. Car. Depose me from this glorious title, Sir, Unless my Clara may divide the honor. Ki. Providence meant her thine, both call me father. Ro. There is no remedy, Nephew, welcom home, And Neece, we shall be kindred now Mendoza, Piracquo we are friends too, and I'll try, How I can love you heartily. Ki. I hear The Altar call, make hast, the triumph will Attend too long, the clouds are chac'd away, Night ne'r was mother to so bright a day. Exeunt omnes. FINIS.</field>
