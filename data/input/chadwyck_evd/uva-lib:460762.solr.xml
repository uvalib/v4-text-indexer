Count Arnfeld, chamberlain, etc. Heinrich, Duke of Traumberg. Corcilius, his friend. Kuno, woodcutter. Klaus, woodcutter. Kauz, ringleader of conspirators. Hans, a gardener.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. âHIS DAUGHTER AND HIS DUCATS.â Scene.âThe garden of Sebastian's palace. On the right a flight of broad steps leading to the palace; on the left a stone seat. Arnfeld discovered alone. Arnfeld. A malediction on the luckless hour That led me to the halls of Schlafenstein, To slave for this grim Duchess and her Duke! A prince's court forsooth! A fiddlestick! By Heaven, 'tis duller than the catacombs, Without their quiet. Do I walk in sleep, Or are we, in our antique garniture, Forgotten travellers of an age outworn, Left on the wayside by the wheels of time, That pass and pass us? Oh, to play the man! Come danger, revolution, anything, Better than one bare swamp of nothingness, Dotted with countless nothings for events! And this old tattered windmill of a Stateâ Her sails stock-still, or only worked for show, Click-clack, with idle winnowings of the air! And see! what shifts to patch the paltry sham! Why, here am I, a simple gentleman, Count Arnfeld, chamberlain and chancellor, Premier and Privy Council all in one, Paymaster of the force, high almoner (A title with no duties for the nonce), My lady's messenger to all and some, And scarce a doit to do with! What of that Beside the thriftless, hard, unhappy lives, All toil, no pleasures, and alas! no pay, Led by our starving peasants? Were it not For that sweet maid, the rose of Schlafenstein, Fair blossom grafted on a graceless stem, Who loves the poorâwell, that is every oneâ The light and fragrance of their dark, foul lives, I wouldâWhat would I? lead them to revolt? I know not, and belike 'tis fortunate Arnfeld lacks time to think what he would do. Well, I may snatch one moment for repose, Now, while Prince Rudolph's love-ambassadors Crave private audienceâthat's a mighty match, If he be worthy, and her will be free; But should she leave us, how could I endure This multitude of petty miseries? The âArnfeld!â here, and âArnfeld!â thereâ Clarissa (behind the scene). Count Arnfeld! Enter Clarissa. Arnfeld. Ah! that's another voice! Mistress Clarissa! Why, how now? Never did you look so pale. Clarissa. Count Arnfeld, I came early to the copseâ By the south entranceâwhere the clearing isâ The Princess sent me, to pick flowers for Klein's Poor dying daughterâshe must have them wildâ When suddenly I overheard them sayâ Arnfeld. Heard whom? Clarissa. The woodcuttersââWe will have bread: If he refuse usââ Then they muttered low; Till the cry rose, âFell no more timber, men; Fell root and branch, the stock of Schlafenstein!â I tarried not the rest. Oh, here they come! Arnfeld. Child, get you quickly in, but let no breath Of these wild rumours reach your lady's ear! Farewell. Be secret; leave the rest to me. [Exit Clarissa. Are rash ejaculations heard in heaven? My prayer for peril brings its answer quick. Enter several Woodcutters, with axes, billhooks, etc. Now, my men, this is a brave trick to frighten ladies with; or is it, perchance, a merry frolic for the Princess on her betrothal-day? Her Highness will be grateful for this proof of your allegiance; she ever loved the people, as you all know; and it is but meet you show the envoys of the Prince, her future lord, how dear you hold her. Shall I conduct you to them? Woodcutters (a confused uproar of voices). We want breadâmwore wagesâwe must live. Down wi' the Duke an' Duchess. TeÃ¤ke off them taxes. Arnfeld. Softly! So many tongues wagging all at once, are like the clashing of bells in a steeple: a man can distinguish nothing but noise; and who is to know whether they ring for a fire or a festival? How many are there of you? Klaus. There be a dozen on us here. Kuno. An' plenty mwore where we come vrom. Arnfeld. Well, then, since one pair of ears can only listen to one voice at once, a man must needs have four and twenty, to understand you speaking all together. Therefore, say I, appoint one of your number to make known what you want, and I'll help you if I can: the rest be silent. Come, now, who is to be your spokesman? Klaus. MeÃ¤ster Hans Klein, ee be the best spo?ksheÃ¤ver in theÃ¤se peÃ¤rts, leÃ¤stways he wer, till the tax come on ceÃ¤rts an' ceÃ¤rriages, an' sin' then he be out o' work. Arnfeld. So, having all his life taught cart-wheels to go round, you would have him lead a revolution of the common weal! At his birth, methinks, Nature framed a better craftsman than herself; for, in making him, she made indeed a good felloe, but left out the nave. But come, now, jesting apart, who is your leader? Who is to speak for you? Kuno, you have a tongue in your head, as your wife knows, and can use it, can't he, Klaus? Klaus. Ay, an' a wonderfu' scholard is Kuno; he can reÃ¤d and write. Arnfeld. Well, then, what have you all left your work and come here for? Kuno. We wants bread, and wull ha' it. Arnfeld. Stay, you're too fast. You may loaf in the Duke's garden till Doomsday, but you'll find no bread-trees growing there. Well, what next? Kuno. We wants our weÃ¤ges mended, we wants 'em riz. Arnfeld. Do you know what wages they give to traitors, that come with weapons against their lawful rulers? Kuno. Ay, the gallus. Arnfeld. Just so, but the gallows are in good repair: therefore, why have them mended? And where's the use of raising what's high enough already? Kuno. You be larfen' at we. Arnfeld. Because I think you're acting foolishly; but I know times are hard. Kuno. Ah! times be heÃ¤rd, an' what's mwore, they be getten heÃ¤rder. My wold 'ooman, she zays to me, âKuno,â she zays, âwe mun a' teÃ¤k the zweet with the zour;â them's her words. âEes,â zays I, âgammer, I knows we mun. Noor I doon't vind noo vault wi' it; but what I vinds vault wi' is this; us worken vo'k gets, as a man may zay, a' the zour and none ov the zweet; and that ain't squeÃ¤re-lik.â A Voice. We wants to bring a hamputation to 'is 'ighness. Klaus. A reputation, he meÃ¤ns, yer honour. Arnfeld. (Aside) The first is what I feared, the second is no easy matter. (Aloud) Yes, yes, a deputation; well, I'll see if I can get you audience to-day, and we must find out where the shoe pinches; but mind, no violence. Meanwhile get back quietly to work, and here's wherewith to sup to-night in honour of the Princess. Now then, some of you were in the Duke's body-guard till it was disbanded, and can obey orders. Right about face! Quick march! [The men retire, cheering in a desultory manner. Duke (from within). Arnfeld! Arnfeld (aside). So far, at least, so good. Duke. Arnfeld! I say. Thunder and lightning! must I call till doom? Arnfeld (aside). That may be nearer, Highness, than you think. [Exit. Enter Kauz from the bushes, where he has been listening. Kauz. All this shall to the Duchess, chamberlain, If not for love of her, for hate of thee. Thou took'st me napping once; I smarted for it. But I have ta'en thee talking in thy nap, That which, a little garbled, shall appear Rank treason to the Duchess, and her schemes For this fine marriageâwhich shall ne'er come off, So my good timber-cutters know their trade. Meanwhile I must be wary, wear two heads Betwixt these shouldersâone, my own, for her, Till she has wreaked my quarrel upon thee; And one, a mask, wherein to spy, unspied, Provoke to wilder tyrannies these tyrants, And whet the axe till they be ripe to fall. [Exit. Enter Heinrich, disguised as a student, parting the boughs cautiously, and calling gently to Corcilius behind him. Heinrich. Corcilius! ho! Corcilius (behind the scene). I come, my lord. Enter Corcilius, similarly attired, with painting-gear and sketch of the landscape. Heinrich. Nay, nay, Unlearn that formal deference, give me leave To forget Traumberg and its mummeries, Do off the prince and don the man; remember, We are plain students on our travels now, Karl and Corcilius merely. But what think you? Whose battlements are these? Corcilius. I cannot tell, Except they top Sebastian's ducal towers; For at my call, by yon half-ruined farm Amid the forest, a starved country lad, Driving his solitary cow, whose sides Showed like a bare-ribbed wreck with sea-weed strung, Made answer we were come to Schlafenstein. Heinrich. Ne'er did mine eyes see such a wilderness; But as I mused if forty years would end Our desert wanderings, lo! the promised land. Corcilius. Nay, out of bosk and tangle so to light On this fair garden is to plunge, methinks, From the dark ages, while a man winks one, To the broad stare of open-eyed to-day. Heinrich. Traumberg and Schlafenstein! You mind the song That hushed our cradle-cries? How ran the rhyme?â âLuck comes to lord of Dream-hill's castled steep, When bruised he rises from the rock of sleep.â I used to wish that I might walk and fall And wake to fame, a child-somnambulist! But that's all over; I have fallen, and waked To failure, not to fame. Can heaven, I trow, With all its sunshine make the mole love light? Nor I the churl's heart sweetness. Who courts praise Of such kills self-approval; and how stoop To love that needs no winningâfruit o'er-ripe Dropped in my very pathway? But the worst is I may not wash my hands of it, nor ease Myself of my own self an hour or twain, But, like the travelling spider, still must spin The cord that binds me to my hated home. I am half-minded never to return, Would Proszka, my poor Atlas of an hour, But shift the whole sad burden to his back. God knows I am weary of it. Corcilius. Courage, Karl! Let Proszka's aid suffice thee; and meanwhile Theirs, and not yours, the failure, whose dead heft Outweighed your powers of lifting. Had you ruled As doth Sebastian, if the world say sooth, A pard fang-fastened on the camel's backâ That patient beast, his peopleâwhile he drains Their dwindling life to glut his miser-maw; Had you done thisâa thought ridiculous, To all your life-deeds cross and contraryâ Even then, so time remained for its undoing, I would not bid you wholly to despair. But now, forsooth, because the herded swine Grunt heedless on, though Orpheus tune the lyre, Or in dim pastures the slow-munching ox Impassive hear the moon-struck nightingale, For this to grieveâ Heinrich. Stay, dear Corcilius, stay! Thou dost but bend the willow, and my heart Belike needs chiding more than words of cheer. Come, let me drug this viper of the brain With sweeter possets! Tush! man, let me see Thy canvass. Hast thou learned to be so coy? Corcilius. 'Tis roughly limned and all imperfect, sire. Heinrich (looking at picture). Perfect in imperfection! A thing done Stands to be judged; and faults and frailties then Peep out for censure, prisoned past escape By the close wall of sheer accomplishment. Corcilius. Ah, poet-like, you love the unrealized. Heinrich. As leaving scope for that ethereal power, Imagination, life's own atmosphere, That softens, melts, subdues, and mystifies This earth's hard outline till it mix with heaven. Why, what a thief art thou, that hast purloined The light, the breath, the lineaments of Nature, And lured them to thy service. The boughs toss, The mist is curdling, and anon will blur Those air-washed isles of sapphire. How yon spurt Of water sways, blown outward on the fall, Like rent white robes o' the flying Bacchanal, Caught in some windy cleft! A churl am I, To envy thee thy skill! Corcilius. What wonders next? Karl envy poor Corcilius! Ye powers! Who envies not the poet? Heinrich. I am none. Anvil and forge are mute. Oh never, friend, Is my heart hot within me, but the blasts Of some distempered passionâfear, love, hate, Remorse, ambitionâthrough the furnace-doors Unruly rush, and quench what they should kindle. Or, like some snowy mistress of the mere, My soul, still mirrored in the calm of thought, Paints truly her own semblance; but one plash Of the outer surface, one plunge inward, mars Her image in the crystal. There, there, there! Still brooding on this canker at the core! 'Tis like the blind heart of the Cretan maze; All paths yield access, but none opens out. Corcilius. I hear some stir within the palace-doors, And hark! a trumpet! Heinrich. Timely interlude, To break fond musings! Let us lurk and watch. [They withdraw behind the bushes. Enter the Duke and Duchess of Schlafenstein, and Arnfeld. Duke. A million thalers, Duchess, did he say? Castor and Pollux! what a pair of gems Blazed on the envoy's finger! Sure his lord Must needs be heir to Sultan Solyman! The man's a Midas! Did he say a million? Yes, 'twas a million thalers by the month! It beggars CrÅsus! Castles half a score, And all for our Helene! I'll not grudge His entertainment; no, by Heaven! not I. We will impound such cattle as have strayed Too near our pleasaunce with unlicensed hoof From off the public pastures, and exact A threefold forfeit. Arnfeld, do you hear? Arnfeld. I do, my liege. (Aside) A murrain on his meanness! Mice are the largest cattle that could browse The thrice-shorn fields. Duke. And, Arnfeld, hark thee hither; Go bid the groom lock fast my stable-bins, And send me word what waste in them is made By good Prince Rudolph's train: needs must the charge Be heavy for so brave an equipage. But 'tis a royal prince. (Arnfeld begins to retire.) And, Arnfeld, see That some post sentries at the buttery-bar: No ale-cask to be broached but at my word, To pay for this day's feasting. Look to it! [Exit Arnfeld. Heinrich. No pard, Corcilius, but a vulture this, Who fattens upon famine. Duchess. Fond old man! Canst thou not strike a balance in thy tongue 'Twixt rank indulgence and bare parsimony, But must be prating of our indigence E'en to the Prince's messenger, revealing, By niggard glance and hint inhospitable, Our ducal state all patched and out at heels? Pshaw! I could blush for shame, when I remember âThis melon is a monster; shall I cut it? Or will you try the filberts? Yon Tokay Would please your lordship. Ah, the cork is sealed, Forgive our homely custom; 'tis a vintage Too rare for general useâshall it be drawn? Our water is much praised in Schlafenstein.â As who should say, âYour lord is generous To stoop so low; you see through our disguises. Who weds my daughter, weds a beggar-girl.â Duke. Well, well, you should have warned me; for indeed The banquet seemed to my poor apprehension, Taken at unawares, a thought too lavish. We cannot pit our table or our tastes Against the richest prince in Christendom; And at such odds to court comparisons, Like children upon tip-toe, nape to nape, Savours of ostentation. Then the dowry, Duchessâyou had forgot our daughter's dowry: The Count had charge to ask no certain sum, Nor saddle our slight means, to make them stumble, If packed beyond their bearing: even so Our ducal treasure scarce will bear the strain Of twice ten thousand ducats; and to this, As paltry, doubtless he had made demur, But for my wise precautions. As it is, By gentle force, the moment ere he mounted, Amid the courtesies of our farewell Taken at disadvantage, I constrained him To bate me of five hundred. Duchess. Princely deed! But I thank Heaven that all your scraping skill Cannot erase the issue or file off His seal upon the bargain. Have you told Helene? Duke. No; nor you? Duchess. No; that is, not Of its conclusion; but I make no doubt To bring her to obedience. True, she hath Bourgeois ambitionsâwhence derived I know not; My house was ever royalâand at times Affects a rustic low simplicity, But scarce can be so foolish as to choose Acorns for diamonds, or indeed prefer Her May-queen splendours to a crown of gold. Should she recoil, 'tis at her proper risk: A maiden's fancies may be strong; my will Is stronger, I believe; and well she knows Whose fingers hold the reins in Schlafenstein. Ah! she approaches. Enter Helene and Clarissa. Heinrich. Well, what think you, friend? Corcilius. So far, the image is of iron and clay. Heinrich (seeing Helene). My God! pure gold to crown it! Duchess. Daughter, welcome! Clarissa, we would speak with the Princess. [Exit Clarissa. Duke. Good news, my fair one! take our gratulations, And give us thine; ay, wish me what you make me, The richest man and happiestâYet I know not; The people call me âmiser,â for they say I have some secret treasures, though in truth 'Tis hard enow to eke our substance out, For thrift's a vice in princes; but methinks I shall grow miser now in my old age, And grudge to lose thee, dear. Helene. To lose me, father? Duchess. Helene, heed not what his Highness saith. You will have guessed our tidings; the alliance That knits your country to a royal house Richer, not more illustrious, than my own, Is now assured; you are the happy link; Be wise and grateful. Child, I give you joy. Helene. Mother, that gift is past impossible. Did I not tell you that I loved him not? Duchess. Love him? Why, no; you have but seen him once; But 'tis of daily proof that woman's love Buds later, and blooms longer, than the man's. Helene. A maiden may not promise, till she love; Or, if she do, her love, outliving his, But yields the harvest of the seed she sowed. Duchess. Well, well, you may be wiser by-and-by. Believe me, girl, you prate of what you know not, A new-fledged bird, that lately from the nest Up-borne to some safe distance, all too soon With saucy pinion trusts her downy strength To dare the empyrean. Helene. Father, mother, Trust me, it is not of mere waywardness That I, perverse or peevish, thwart your will. Yoke me to any service, howso' hard, That may beseem a maiden and your child, Then blame, if I deny you; nay, subject me To some harsh mistress, as her scullion-drudge, In rags to dress, and feed on menial fare, Rough blows for wage, and, mother, I will do itâ Ay, bear it without murmur, if I may;â But this one thing I may not. Duchess. And yet this One thing you must, or be for ever named A child undutiful, unnatural, Ruthless and reckless of her father's fame, Who, from the high beach gazing, saw the bark Of all his fortunes founder, and yet spared To soil her dainty fingers with the rope That else had saved it from the swallowing sea. Helene. Bid them clutch fire, my fingers should not shrink; But thou wouldst wind this rope about my soul. Duchess. Among the princes who is Rudolph's peer? What is there of man's having he hath not? Young, valiant, noble, and of stainless name, For riches and renown incomparable, A monarch's heirâsearch through the starry maze Of hopes that fill your maiden firmament, And tell me what is lacking. Helene. All is lacking: There lacks the sacred fire, the spark from heaven, That gilds the planets and inflames the suns, Making dull clods celestial. Duke. Sure, my child, A million thalers by the month would make Some twinkling in the darkness. Helene. What is wealth, Or rank, or title, but a gaudy frame Outside the picture, whether foul or fair? If foul, what virtue hath the frame to mend? If fair, what vice to mar it? In my heart, Wed who wed may, love only can be lord, And at no other shrine no priest but his Shall spill its costliest treasure. What care I For all the pomp of all the tawdry throng, That slay the soul to Mammon? Can gilt horns Or showy garlands make the victim glad? Fie on the folly and the sin of it! Oh, mother, pardon: in your love for me You have forgotten what it is to love. Duchess. I humbly thank you. In these latter days, So spins the world, our poor weak heads grow giddy: Crazed and decrepit ere the noon of life Our ripe experience raves like doting eld, While scarce-weaned babies from the cradles jump, And serve their sires for crutches. Your good sermon Was well conceived, and passing well digested; For like a practised preacher, whose quick wit Plays through the skies of his discourse, at first Remote, innocuous, with dull muffled peals Of warning thunder, till, probation passed, The rent heaven crumbles to the crack of doom,â So treasured you your nimblest flash to blind, Your loudest clap to stun us at the close. Helene. What mean you, mother? Duchess. How! so innocent? I âhave forgotten what it is to love;â In your young mind the memory seems fresh. Who is the happy shepherd that shall pipe Upon the hill-slopes at Helene's side? Helene. I love but one man in the world. Duchess. And he?â Helene. Is somewhere in this garden. Duchess. Gracious heaven! Helene (looking towards the Duke). Can you not see him? Duchess. Nay; this passes bearing. Think you to fool me with your pleasantries? But I shall yet find means to make you saner. I know who fosters that unruly spirit, Uses your puling pity to inflame The smouldering heart of rebeldom, distilling Soft drops of flattery into treason's ear; All this I know, and more. Do you turn pale? There may be cause anon. Meanwhile I leave you To thrive on your fine scruples, as you may, And without arms, men, money, or allies, By winning manners to win off the tide Of Rudolph's vengeance. [Exit. Duke. Nay, you must not kiss me: I have been worse, more cruel, than your mother, More deaf to nature, and more dead to sense. Forgive me, dearest; I am very poor, Nor wist how paltry to my soaring bird Would seem the glitter of a golden cage. But, come what may, we will not have it so. I am not worthy of thee. Gold, gold, gold, Thatâthat it is I thirst for, live for, pray for, Think of, and dream of; ay, sometimes I dream That there are buried treasures, which I visit Even in the dead of night, and wake to lose, Till horror takes me that my wits are crazed; But looking in thine eyes I do not fear it, For still I find my costliest treasure there. Helene. We are alone now, father, quite alone: May I unburden all my heart to you, And ease its aching? Heinrich. Stop your ears, Corcilius, On your allegiance. Corcilius. Does Duke Heinrich bid? Heinrich. No, no; but Karl implores thee. Corcilius. Well, then, see, They are almost sound-tight. Heinrich. Let no word leak in. Duke. Is it about thyself? Helene. Not altogether: Why love you gold? It does not make you happy. Duke. No, child; nor wine the drunkard, yet he loves it. Helene. Oh, let me woo thee back to thine old self, Untwist the threads, this spider avarice, With unseen shuttle coursing to and fro, Hath woven about thy heart! Duke. Too late, too late! Helene. Then, would you have me wed Prince Rudolph, father? Duke. Nay, since you love him not. Helene. But if I loved him? Duke. Then I should lose thee, and be left alone, And, though but now I knew it not, that loss Would quench the splendour. Helene. Then, 'tis not too late; The love of me against the love of goldâ Love matched with love, the stronger love must win. Thou hast made choice betwixt us. Duke. Ah! child, child, This way or that, my life-days are eclipsed: For either needy clouds usurp the sun, Or thou, the finger of my dial-plate, Half-gilded by his beams, a shade wilt cast From hour to hour, and all the hours are mine. Helene. I would that thou couldst love the people more: Their wealth, the common wealth, would make thee happier. Duke. I cannot. They are base, rebellious, hateful: Unthrifty, they have brought my land to ruin; Disloyal, they have made me what I am. Helene. Be what you were, not what you are, dear father, Except to me. Long years ago I mind me Of one sweet morn in summer, when you rode Hunting or hawking on the mountain-side, And met your little maiden flushed with flowers, And trailing flowers at every wasteful step, And stooping plucked her to your side, and kissed, And called her fairest of them all, and said That she was more than the wide world to you. Do you remember, father? Duke. Ay, my child. Helene. Tread back, obliterate the dead past, that lies Betwixt that living moment and to-day. [The Duke bows his head upon her shoulder. Heinrich. Corcilius, is the secret spoken? Corcilius. Ay, This moment ended. Heinrich. Thou hast listened, then. Enter Arnfeld. Arnfeld. A deputation waits to see your Highness; Shall they have audience, sire? Duke. From whom? Arnfeld. Your serfs. Duke. No, not to-day. Helene. Yes, father, yes. Duke. Admit them. [Exit Arnfeld. Heinrich. Corcilius, I must throw myself before herâ She is a goddessâand declare my love, My name, my state; for I am hers, hers only. Corcilius. Ay, but she is not thine. What, Karl, art mad? Remember Rudolphânay, you shall not go, By Heaven! Be patient, or you ruin all. Re-enter Arnfeld, introducing Kuno, and Kauz disguised as a peasant. Arnfeld. These men, sire, crave permission but to read A brief memorial to your Highness, drawn Roughly, 'twould seem, and with untutored wit By peasants of your land, who treat therein Of certain wrongs alleged, and grievances. Will't please you they should read? Duke. First call the Duchess. Arnfeld. Her Highness, sire, but now has left the palace. Kauz (aside). The less risk of discovery, Kauz, for thee. Helene (after whispering with the Duke). You have permission, friends; I pray you read. Kuno (reads). âYer Highness, â'Tis a lang leÃ¤ne as 'as noo turnen, but us be well nigh come to b'leeve that ours is jist that langth. There doon't zeem no pertikler zign ov a bend i't, nother to the right han', noor yet to the left; and us be mwost tired o' gooen on straÃ¯ght.

Duke. Well, my ragged friend, when all's said, you are scarce so poor for a delver as I for a duke, nor sunk so low neither as he they call his Highness, when he listens to such words as yours. We will consider your petition; but bring not that scowling ruffian with you, when next you come, unless his legs lack hose; for we are scarce so poor yet, but we shall find stocks to fit him. [Exeunt Kuno and Kauz. Duke. These are the people whom you bid me love! Helene. Yes, father; then they would not be so wretched. Duke. Who were they? Do you know? Helene. The man who read Was Kuno, a poor woodcutter; the other I know not, but his mien was villainous, And made me shudder. Heinrich. Thou art right, Corcilius; I will take office with this pauper-duke, And earn the sight of her by daily toil. Corcilius. It must be, then, for love. Heinrich. For love indeed; What hire so rich? But peace! and follow me. [They come out of hiding. Duke. Ah! strangers in our presence? Heinrich. Pardon, sire, We are poor travellers, and, I fear, intruders, Who, from the forest issuing suddenly On this trim garden, almost dare to think We stand before the enchanter Prospero And fair Miranda. Duke. Sir, your voice and bearing Seem courtlier than your dress; but rather deem This lady here the enchantress, who would strive, Medea-like, with cauldron-witcheries To blanch the shrivelled kernel of old age Back to the pink-white of the almond-flower. Helene. Nay, sir, be thou the wizard, I thy daughter, And these the waifs and jetsam of the storm Thy spells have conjured. Duke. May we know your names? Heinrich. This is my friend Corcilius, at your service, Artist and scholar; and men call me Heinrichâ That is, my name isâKarl. Corcilius. May it please your Highness, My wayfellow so counterfeits in person The likeness of my lord the Duke of Traumberg, From whom we come, that he in merry sport Dubbed him his namesake. Arnfeld. Wherefore came ye hither? Heinrich. To seek some other service, for alas! The Duke our master hath of late been swayed By such strange humours of dark melancholy, That he hath doffed awhile the load of state, And, to his court a stranger, courts repose. This letter, by his Highness penned and sealed, Be warrant for us both. Will't please you read it? Duke (reading). âTo all whom it may concern, greeting. âBe it known that the bearer of this letter is a trusty and right loyal servant to ourself, the Duke of Traumberg, and that there is no person in all our court whom we love so well. His friend, who accompanies him, is, though less highly esteemed by us, full worthy of regard and commendation; and both alike are diligent, deserving, and apt for any honourable employment. (Signed) âHeinrich.â I fear I shall not stead you in this business, Good gentlemen, desire it as I may. We keep but slender state in Schlafenstein, And, to be plain without discourtesy, Our revenues of late have ebbed so low, That I am well-nigh grounded, nor may risk To lade my vessel with a larger freight. Heinrich. Thanks, sire. If I may answer you as plainly, We come as willing workers, not for hire; My lord of Traumberg was so liberal To all his servants, most of all to me, That we, well stored for many months to come, Ask but the freedom of your Highness' court, To do what service may be serviceable. Duke. I take your offer, then. Count Arnfeld, tell me What offices are vacant. Arnfeld. All, my lord, Save those of major-domo, chamberlain, Chancellor, page, and privy counsellor, With what beside I, charlatan in chief Unto your Highness, have these many years Made shift, and multiplied myself to fill. Corcilius. Might I presume so far to make suggestion, Within the forest's heart, some miles to northward Of this your palace, as we journeyed hither, We passed from hour to hour, with scarce a break, Such tall tree-columns roofed with verdurous gloom, That, blinded by the interminable files Of leafy veterans on their moveless march, Our eyes grew dizzy, and we marvelled why Such wealth of timber, such gigantic girths, Ringed with the watermarks of ages, stood To whet the boar's tusk, and defy mankind. Heinrich. There, sire, are pines enow for all the masts That ever rocked o'er Spanish galleons, And oaks to rib their armaments, or serve The sea-beleaguered Hollanders for piles, To found their ooze-built cities; and all these Wait but the magic axe to make them gold. Duke. Gold? sayst thou gold? Heinrich. Were I your forester, And good Corcilius here to second me, Backed by a thousand of your stoutest arms, We should, by traffic with some neighbouring prince, So underbid the merchants, I doubt not, As both to flood the coffers of your State, Enrich the country, strike at discontent, And make the desert sweet and habitable. Duke. It shall be done. Helene child, go in, Make ready for our friendsâwe have too long Been blind, or dreaming. But I pray you, sirs. Clip not the market-value; no, no, no; Labour is cheap in Schlafenstein, but scarce So plenty as of oldâfull price, full price! [Helene goes slowly up palace steps, but turns with appealing look to her father as she hears his closing words. Curtain.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. âLOST! LOST! LOST!â Scene same. TimeâThree months later. Duchess discovered alone, with open letter in her hand. Duchess. I am sorry for it. This untimely war Has for the present foiled my purposes. Rudolph in arms against a foreign foe Puts hope to threefold peril. First, and worst, Being no carpet-warrior, he may fall, Or lose his princedom, or a part of it; Or, at the best, this heat of heart may cool, Love's fire wax pale beside the war-god's blaze. Methought ere this his presence would have cured My winsome mistress of her wilfulness: Well, should he triumph in his warlike quest, Those eyes, that blenched not at the glint of gold, Bright-burnished steel may dazzle. Like enough. Enter Kauz. But here is Kauzâour piece ubiquitous Upon the boardâknight, bishop, pawn in one, By whose swift moves, or cunning ambuscades, I oft have checked, and purpose to check-mate, Our virtuous chamberlain. Kauz. What would your Highness? Duchess. A word with thee. Kauz. 'Tis time, methinks, for deeds. Duchess. My deeds thou'lt find no worser than my words. Art thou prepared to swear thou heardst him slander Thy lord and me? Kauz. If he may slander speak Who speaks but with himself, none by to heed. Duchess. Then is he guilty twice, in ear and tongue, For telling first, then hearkening, his own tale. But, more than this, thou heardst him muttering Wild threats of revolutionâthat himself Would lead the vassals to our overthrow, And much disparaging Prince Rudolph's suit, As though he knew one worthier. Kauz. This I heard, And further marked him holding treasonous parle With riot and rebellionâa bold gang, That shouted death unto your Highnesses E'en at the palace gates. Duchess. And he repliedâ Kauz. With flattery and fair words, entreating them To patience till the hour were ripe, and faith In Arnfeld's friendship, and their quarrel his, And so with largess sent them on their way. Duchess. With largess! ha! thou saidst not so before. Kauz. I spake but of his words. Nathless, at parting He flung them for their pains a purse of gold. Good fees make faithful servants. Duchess. Thou art one, And shalt have cause to be more faithful yet. [Giving him money. This little seed, late fallen from thy lips, Dropped in good soil, where it shall fructify, Take root ere long, and blossom to his bane. MeanwhileâI know thou hast the appetiteâ Pry into all his secrets, and search out What more thou canst of his expenditure; Then bring me word. Be watchful, and farewell. [Exit Kauz. So ho! then Arnfeld is the nibbling rat That makes this leakage in the treasury! [Exit. Enter Heinrich as Forester, conversing with Arnfeld. Arnfeld. 'Tis as thou sayst, good Forester; except The work find wages, why, of naught comes naught. Heinrich. Of naught awhile came plenty, which good crop I for his Highness reaped, you housed the same; Of this a tithe's tithe spent, as now 'tis spared, Would yield him tenfold harvest. Arnfeld. Thou art right. Oh for some fine persuasive shaft to pierce The Duke's impenetrable stubbornness! Heinrich. One shaft there is, but something overfine For our tough bow-stringsâhis fair daughter. Arnfeld. Well, Should others fail, that arrow, too, we'll try; But my grey goosequill must be ventured first. Heinrich. Good luck go with thee! I wait here the while. [Exit Arnfeld. Where will this end? Before I left the forest Mysterious whispers, that were not the wind's, Stirred threateningly the branches, and will soon Swell to an angry roar. Never did work More worthy done, reap tardier recompense: Yet still Sebastian must keep back their hire; And I stand pledged to payment! Should we fail, I have but armed the knaves against their lord, And found them a fair quarrel. We must wrench Somehow the miser's hands from his own throat, And force him to breathe free. 'Tis strange, methinks, How sweet mere drudgery tastes at Schlafenstein, That smelt so stale in Traumberg. (Picking up a paper.) What is this? âTo the Chief Forester.â From whom, I wonder. [Opening it. Some friend, who claims to preach incognito. [Reading. âOne that hath hidden knowledge, from this day Bids thee consort not with the traitor A.â âAâ? Arnfeld! traitor! Pshaw! and on the word Of one who fears the sight of his own name? I'll not believe it. Enter Duke, Duchess, and Arnfeld. Duke. Treachery! treachery! We have been robbed, robbed, robbed! Arnfeld. I trust your Highness Will bid immediate search be made of all, Who to the court have access. Duchess. 'Tis well said. Sir, give the order, and begin with him. Arnfeld. Madam, I too demand it, and dare hope 'Twill yet repent you of that heinous word, When time unfolds the sequel. Foul suspicion Taints not a life's pure serviceâno, nor yet Stains the clear conscience, which, like earth herself, To its own bosom takes the refuse flung, And turns to wholesome savour. Duchess. Did you not Lend countenance to bawling knaves, who came With axes armed, and ruffian insolence, To lop the laws and prune all privileges, That curb the licence of their upstart growth, And intercept forsooth the light of heaven? Did you not carp at thronÃ¨d power, and plant Ladders of hope, for indigence to climb by, Wink at their claims, allow their grievances, And send them glad and gilded to their homes? Did you do this, or not? And, if you did, How thrives your conscience, and whence came your gold? Arnfeld. Madam, your spies have done their duty well, Baked a fair loaf, with so much flour of truth As hides the bane, 'twas kneaded up withal. I deemed myself alone, and, with myself Communing, spake what I will not repeat, Save to myself again. Your listener lied I chid their violence, fooled away their threats, Dulled every axe-edge with my blunt reproofs, And if their wives, at meeting, grasped that day No empty hands, what filled them was my own. Duchess. Who else hath access to the treasury? Arnfeld. None that I know, except your Highnesses. Duchess. Then either are we robbers of ourselves, Or elseâWell, well, the inference is easy. Enough of this: we will make search anon. Good Master Forester, how pay you now The thews and sinews of your enterprise? Heinrich. It much imports, believe me, that you keep Faith with these men; the knaves are worth their hire; And, if denied, their numbers and their needs Will make them dangerous. Duke. I tell you, sir, My means are bankrupt: many a time before, Have I suspected from some petty loss The pilfering fingerâsome slight surface-theft, Beside the long slow thaw of time, that wastes, Drip, drip, the polished crustâbut never felt I A crash like this. Bid them go starve, I say; I have no doit to spare, no doit to spare. Heinrich. What! is the whole mass melted quite away? Duke. All. Duchess. Or what seems all. (Aside) From a miser's heart Pluck but one treasure, the black void beneath Wells up and over, darkening what remains. (Aloud) But tell me, sir, your lictors' claims appeased, Were there good market for our timber still? Heinrich. Ay, to repay your cast a hundredfold: As five chips to a forest, so past winnings To what may yet be won. Duchess. Why, let us in, then, To track the traitor, and to count our loss. [Exeunt all but Heinrich. Heinrich. To count our loss, and haply lose our Count! As well store wine in reservoirs of sand, As treasure in yon tills! the Danaids' curse Is on them; and so late I quenched their drought With a full draught of gold! O Arnfeld, Arnfeld! My heart and senses are at feud about thee; I feel thou art loyal, and yet fear thou'rt false. [Sits down wearily. Helene (heard singing within). 'Tis an old, old tale, I trow; Be not fooled with outward show; Deep within love's treasures lie; Trust the heart, and not the eye: Though your faith in man be gone, Or in woman, still love on; Still believe against belief: Love is lasting, falsehood brief. Heinrich. Hark! my good angel's voice upbraiding me! I know not, I, what charm ineffable Steals from her spirit into mine, and fills Earth with the freshness as of early dawn, When with her maiden-step she blesses it. There seems no need of the millennium then; Say, rather, it is hereâall Nature knows it; In all her moods transfigured, glorified; Such power on earth to one pure soul is given. Is it for me alone of men, I wonder, Her key unlocks the universe, makes faith A revelation, hope an ecstasy, And love the wheels on which the world goes round? All shocks of time, all sorrows and despairs, When she is by, seem light and curable, Mere jolts and jars upon the planet's track, That check the course, not change it, or, at worst, But self-opposÃ¨d forces, tending each, And helping, to the perfect poise of heaven. Enter Corcilius. Corcilius. What, Karl, ballooning in the clouds? Thou look'st For all the world as thou hadst seen a vision. Heinrich. Perhaps I have, of plots and treacheries, Theft, slanders, avarice, seething up together In one black whirlpool. Corcilius. While from one white hand Out of the cloud-rift shower cool flakes of peace, To heal and quench it? Heinrich. Well, what brings you here? Corcilius. Clarissa. 'Tis five hours since we have met; Besides, the woods wax clamorous for the sop That lulls awhile their thousand-throated foe. Heinrich. Alack! the ducal larder has been robbed! With this and other home-pushed accusations, The Duchess rails on Arnfeld, who has foesâ Witness this paper, whether false or trueâ Sebastian wrings his hands, and blind with rage Bids starve the goose that laid the eggs of gold. Corcilius. 'Tis an old saw, in him, I fear, found trueâ âWhom the gods hate, they first with madness strike.â Heinrich. Naught else it were to prove close-handed now. Corcilius. Will nothing stir him? Heinrich. Only what would stir A vice, rust-soldered: all the drugs of science Could not relax this tetanus of soul, Or heal the heart of lock-jaw. No, my friend, There is but one hope left us. Here it comes! Enter Helene and Clarissa. Helene. Oh, sir, you know what trouble brews withinâ The treasury plundered, faithful Arnfeld wronged, Our workmen wageless, left an easy prey To windy rumours worse than any truthâ And you and good Corcilius loitering here! Clarissa. This good Corcilius, as you call him, madam, I still have found a loiterer, good for nought. Corcilius. There stands the culprit; 'tis no blame to me. True steel will loiter where the magnet lies. Clarissa. Am I your magnet, then? and do I lie? Corcilius. Ay, when you bear false witness. Helene. Prithee, peace! [Corcilius and Clarissa go aside together. And from the forest, say, what tidings bring you? Heinrich. Alas! dear lady, like a star thou comest, The faint sole hope of foundering mariners, When the sea raves and heaven is blotched with storm. Helene. It is no time for trope or compliment; Say out the worst. What is it? Heinrich. The worst is E'en what yourself have said. I cannot go Back to these men, and bid them toil for naught; They have done well, the towers of your new Troy Are rising fairâ Helene. And, like Laomedon, The Duke defrauds his builders, you would say. Heinrich. Except his guardian angel should dissuade him. Helene. Is that the worst? Heinrich. Nay; for, if speak I must, There is a worse fear yet, as evils known Are easier coped with than some treacherous ill, Tricked with the attributes and hues of health, That saps unseen the fortress of our life, And takes the heart from action. Helene. Oh, these men! How oft 'twixt failure and success there lies Naught but a finger-breadth of human faith! Heinrich. What would you have me do? Helene. Believe, and act. Heinrich. In whom should I believe? Helene. Believe in Arnfeld, And your own heart; believe that gold can melt, Our senses cheat us, ear and eye play false; Believe some tricksy demon plagues us so, Yea, and what most is unbelievable, Rather than disbelieve the faith of friends. Heinrich. I would believe the devil, if you bade me. Helene. Blind faith! the father of the infidel! I say not trust the demonstrably false, But let your eyes, that spell the smaller type, Woman, now con the larger text of man. 'Tis well, methinks, you were not born to rule; For rulers should be readers of mankind, And you are none. To have known the man three months, And doubt him! Pshaw! 'twere saner to believe That I myself had done the deed in sleep, Than Arnfeld waking. Heinrich. Lady, say no more. Should he be self-arraigned, I'ld swear he lies, And cancel disbelief with disbelief. Corcilius (returning with Clarissa). You are a thief, and have purloined my heart. Clarissa. A hollow bauble, which, being thrust upon me, Too paltry seemed to pelt you back withal. Corcilius. And I believe you robbed the treasury. Clarissa. I'll not deny 'twere better worth the pains. Heinrich. I fear, Corcilius, you have found your match. Corcilius. (Aside) I hope I have. (Aloud) A match I dare not strike; If one but speak to her, she sputters sparks. Helene. Your tongues are like two battledoors; but now Or drop, or catch, this shuttlecock of wit. Corcilius, I have work for you to do. Corcilius. Work for your Highness is but holiday, That rids me of her rating for the nonce. Helene. You shall play truant, then. Now, Forester, Take you this wallet; it is charged with gold Of mine own hoarding, saved and husbanded For no such swift defrayal; but all needs, E'en charitable gifts, are luxuries Not to be thought of, while the clamorous mouths Of our just debts remain unsatisfied. So take it, sir, and bid Corcilius, That is, if you can trust himâah! you wince!â Speed to the forest with what sum will serve; And be the remnant locked from overflow, That our fair enterprise come not aground, Till hope swell buoyant with the tide's return. Heinrich. Princess, 'tis not for me to thank or praise; And yetâbut no; since either spoken word, So fate decrees, must seem presumptuous, Let swift obedience act alike for both. Now, friend, upon your welcome errand hie, And may good tidings speed the journey back! Corcilius. Amen. Clarissa, pray for my return, To wile the hours of absence. Clarissa. Never fear; I shall outlive the time; yet loiter not. Heinrich. Methinks Corcilius grows so light of brain, That, lest his hand make autumn in the world, Strewing the wood-floor with untimely gold, By your good leave I'll set him on his way With some sage counsel, and return anon. [Exeunt Heinrich and Corcilius. Clarissa. I'll warrant him to keep his word, too. There goes as pretty a pair of lovers as ever fair ladies feigned to be weary of. Helene. Pair of lovers! What mean you by that, Mistress Oracle? Have you snared them both? Clarissa. Nay. I have singed the wings of one; but the other flutters round a brighter lamp than mine; he beats his head against the moon. Helene. Poor lunatic! But I am in no mood for riddle-solving. What is the sober truth of it? Clarissa. Tell me, is it part of my duty to you, Madam, to break faith with others? Helene. No. Clarissa. I would you had said ay; for then I might have eased my mind, without burdening my conscience. Helene. In what relation, pray, stand you to the Forester, that you should prate of secrecy? Clarissa. I am his first confidante, once removed. Helene. Expound. Clarissa. Corcilius is the bucket that goes down the well, and I the pitcher it spills into at the top. Helene. Go not too often to that well, lest you be broken at last. Clarissa. No fear, Madam; but, if you thirst for stolen waters, take these three sips: first, Karl the Forester is a poet. Helene. I guessed as much from his moodiness, his metaphors, and his melancholy face. Clarissa. Secondly, he is in love with a lady far above himself in rank. Helene. That is the way with poetsâeither too high, or else too low; nothing on the level track hits their fancy. But tell me, how high does this poet aim? Clarissa. Just as high, if I mistake not, as Paris, son of Priam, King of Troy. But, thirdly, I have here a song, writ by his hand, and from his heart, to the lady of his despair. Shall I read it? Helene. You may, if it amuse you. I do not promise to attend; but read. Clarissa (reading). âIn the green forest-spaces, Brim-full of bright flower-faces, The sum of all their graces, She stood before me; And on my spirit such a shower Of radiance shed, that, hour by hour, I know no respite from the power Love wieldeth o'er me. âAs with presumptuous motion Streams vex the vast of ocean, What can my poor devotion But shame and flout her? So weak my worth, so low my lot, Life's very self sufficeth not To cast upon love's heap; for what Were life without her? âYet be the thought forgiven That I, with sins unshriven, Dare lift so nigh to heaven A heart so earthy: Though not its highest, holiest sighs To thy pure atmosphere may rise, One look of love from those dear eyes Would make me worthy.â Well, for a man of plain feature and lowly birth so to write of beauty and his betters! Helene. Hush! simpleton; Corcilius had no hand in it. But hie thee to the palace, and bring Count Arnfeld hither. Begone, I say. (Exit Clarissa.) The two men shall meet before me. If the heart of the Forester be indeed as clay upon my wheel, I will so mould and temper it, as no more to suffer love-leakage through the cracks of doubt. Re-enter Heinrich. Heinrich. Lady, I spake nor trope nor compliment, But the mere surface and bare shell of truth: You are our saving and our guiding star. Helene. Well, well, the tongue's a strange interpreter! So ruefully your look belied the word, I rather deemed that in some doleful house Of heaven my planet with thwart influence Had crossed the skies of your nativity. Heinrich. It may beâyet, what say I? All my life, Battle against it with what heart I may, Have I been subject to strange loss of cheer, And sudden overcloudings of the soul, As ifâI know notâthrough some door of heaven A bleak wind blew, that put the sunshine out, And one by one the flowers, and the bird's songs. E'en so, dear Princess, fared it with me now, When at the point of joy, 'twixt thought and speech, My heart grew faint with sad presentiment. Helene. To find and keep an equipoise of soul 'Twixt hopes and fears, ambition and content, Whence, like the hovering hawk, to swoop or soar, Passed e'en the wit of wisest Solomon: Yet 'tis the secret of true happiness. I speak but as a mere maid, nature-taught, And innocent of all philosophies. Heinrich. You speak the thing you areâa soul ensphered Beyond the need of all philosophies. But with us men, methinks, 'tis seldom so: Impatient of the laws that either way Set bounds to being, we o'er-strain our powers, And, leaving soul or body in the lurch, Would fain be gods or satyrs, fire or clay; All, save the happy, well-attempered few, Who, citizens of earth, keep touch with heaven. Helene. So stand you self-convicted: those that dare The peril of strange regions, life in handâ Sheer Alp, dry desert, or the frozen poleâ Fired with a glorious madness, must abide By their own choice, and grudge not to forego The peaceful skies above the village spire. You might have compassed in a single word The sum of all your miseries, and said, âI am a poet.â Heinrich. O false prophetess! That were my sum of joys. But there are poets By natural frailty or some freak of fate Foredoomed to silence. Helene. Then let silence speak In action that proclaims the voice within. That is my answer. Heinrich. Other some there are, Who, finding utterance, hazard and dare all, To pluck one gold star from the galaxy; Yet the world heeds not. Helene. Let them strive and fail. To have failed nobly is enough reward, So trim their pinions to a humbler flight, And win the peace that comes through suffering. Heinrich. Poets and thinkers are life's aeronauts; They mount to windy regions, where the soul, Sailing through shoreless and tempestuous seas, May well be lost for lack of pilotage, Yet scorns to grapple the dull earth again. Helene. Then must their scorn console them; yet methinks E'en for the wild swan happier far to cleave The mere, high-breasted, than droop wings in heaven. How say you, sir? Heinrich. I know not. I have tried Both; have essayed the firmament, and found A barren exultation, but no joyâ The conqueror's triumph, near akin to scorn; Then, stooping to the mere, have seen beneath, Height over height, transfigured, yet the same, A happier heaven, wherein I love to gaze, But may not enter. Helene. Your own art-ideal, Dimly reflected here in Schlafenstein? Heinrich. Nay, but the living substance, of which Art, With its fantastic, though creative, power, Saw but the shadow. Helene. And this happier heavenâ Why, since so near you, lies it out of reach? Heinrich. Ah! would you bid me hope that it does not? Helene. It lies, believe me, sir, in all men's powerâ Heinrich. In all men's? Helene. Ay, to weave from their own lives A heaven above them, or a hell beneath. I speak not of the dome which Fancy rearsâ A glorious bubble, by God's breath inspired, Blown from the lips of genius; that indeed Were a fair house for mind and soul to dwell in, And with pure beauty hold eternal parle, Far from the turmoil of mortality. But lonely contemplation is not life; And he who dwells thereinâthough few be they That can find solace thereâmust dwell aloof From all the myriad needs that make up Man. Heinrich. What is that other heaven, that all may reach? Helene. That which you call the heaven within the mereâ Thought and emotion, those ethereal rays That light Imagination's airy realm, Pent in the mind that bred them, through the thin Rare atmosphere shoot colourless and cold, Sheer from the zenith. Let them fall aslant, Mix with earth's mists, and strike the water's face, Dive to the troubled depths of human life, With softening power irradiate the gloom, Glancing, refracted, interpenetratingâ Lo! you have warmth and colour, light and shade, The play of passion, and the heart of peaceâ That chequered heaven, which is the sphere of man. Heinrich. So, loftiest thought to lowliest service bowed, That is your spell to make life beautiful. Heinrich of Traumberg, thou art tried and judged! Helene. Heinrich of Traumberg! Heinrich. Ah! you knew him not. The worse for Heinrich, and for Traumberg too! Helene. He was of noble nature, as men say, And yet unhappy. Have you known him long, And was he dear to you? Heinrich. As mine own self. From earliest childhood we were bred together, And our first parting fell upon the day That brought me to the towers of Schlafenstein. Helene. No marvel you are sad, then. I myself Ne'er had a playmate, but in happy dreams Have pictured one in closest sisterhood, So twined about me as well-nigh to break My foolish heart, on waking to her loss. Oh, sir, you should have told me; I had then Pitched my poor music to a kinder key, And sung the sorrow of fresh-parted friends. Heinrich. Such friends are happier parted. We had lived In the same palace of enchanted hope, Built of bright visions, pinnacled in air, Upon ideal beauty banquetingâ He Duke, I poet, welded into oneâ Not heedless wholly of the crowd below, But thinking in our folly these would quit Their filthy sty for our fair paradise, As Traumberg were indeed the Hill of Dreams; But they still grovelled on, we still aspired, Till disappointment, like a changing wind, Scattered the cloudy fabric. Helene. Ah! and then? Heinrich. We left them to their wallowing in the mire. What, think you, does he merit, who so failed In faith to heaven, his subjects, and himself? Helene. Oh, bid not me pass sentence, lest the doom Recoil two-edged on her that utters it, Piercing the bosom nearest to her own. Heinrich. Is not the whole world's record marred by this? That power is oft his birthright, on whose soul Nature has set no mark of sovereignty, But either sense enslaves him, and his mouth Needs bit and bridle, whose hand holds the rein, Or thirst for conquest, or some crazy creed Of honour, makes his people miserable; Or he is one for lowlier service framed By heaven, to labour for the needs of men, As wise physician, skilled artificer, Or, lover of the soul's more lonely heights, Poet or saint or sage. There throned he sits, While in the crowd, unnoticed haply, stands The heaven-born ruler; but the same dark fate That made him kingly, made him not a king; So the blind law of birth confounds us all. Helene. Well, here comes one whom the blind law of birth Made a kind friend and faithful counsellor. Enter Arnfeld and Clarissa. At last, Clarissa! Clarissa. Madam, my best speed Availed not earlier to obey you: first, There were some tears of duty to be shed At parting from Corcilius; then, to wash From both mine eyes the misty storm-rings left, Like halos round the moon; and last, to lure This wildered falcon from his fruitless chase, To perch upon my wrist. Helene. Well, come your ways; You grow too pert. We'll leave you, sirs, together. [Exeunt Helene and Clarissa. Heinrich. Arnfeld, forgive me. Arnfeld. What unknown offence? Heinrich. A moment's doubt of your fair loyalty. Arnfeld. No marvel, sir, if you, so late a stranger, Suspect me somewhat, being much suspected Of those whom I have served full forty years. I do not blame you; nay, this mystery So baffles my poor wisdom to unravel, I am half minded to suspect myself. Here is my hand as index to my heart, That beating witness in the breast, which saith There is no grudge between us. Heinrich. Know you this? [Showing him the anonymous paper. The trees here, it would seem, shed poisonous leaves. This morn I found it dropped upon my path. Arnfeld (glancing at it). I know not, but conjecture. There is one Kauz, whom, erewhile an officer of taxes, I ousted for extortion; whereupon With rancorous cunning he so slandered me Before the Duchess, who ne'er loved me well, That I have long since led a hunted life, And grope my way like some lost trespasser In a dark wood, where traps are laid. But now, To repay trust with trust, I have a word For thy sole ear. Heinrich. Importing of the State? Arnfeld. And of three livesâone precious; not indeed That any ruffian could find heart to hate A presence of such sweetness, as might heal The bitterest Mara-waves of misery; But in so dark a plotâ Heinrich. Oh, friend, be brief; You torture me: what plot? Arnfeld. A plot to murder The ducal house, seize on the treasury, Preach rapine and revolt, and through the land Loose all the windy passions from their cave, Till smouldering licence swell to raging fire. Heinrich. Whence know you this? Arnfeld. From one whom I know well, But may not nameâa woodsman of your band, Who overheard the ruffians in their talk. You are the witless cause of this new peril; For even thieves will not conspire for naught, And we erewhile lay empty as the dry Wind-sifted bottom of some torrent's bed, Till like Pactolus through the land you flow, Spangling the mud-floor with bright specks of gold. Heinrich. Thou hast indeed repaid me good for ill. We must not quit the palace for one hour. Who is their leader? Arnfeld. More he might not tell, Save that by one, who spake with a masked face, The signal should be givenâa trumpet blown Loud from the forest-edge, some nine days hence, As chance should offer. Heinrich. You have guards at hand, Whom we may count upon? Arnfeld. Ay, true as steel, Hid within hearing through the palace-park, Who know the signal, and will act upon itâ Hearts that would hush their beating for her sake. I go e'en now to visit them. Farewell, And silence! [Exit Arnfeld. Heinrich. 'Tis a golden chance, I hope, Of Heaven's own sending! Once in a man's life, And once for all, a moment comes, 'tis said, When, like Bellerophon, if swift and sudden, He too may catch wing'd Fortune by the mane, And ride through heaven. Oh, if she cross my path, What though at hurricane speed, I shall make shift To mount her yet, for love leaps fast and far. Soon shall the horror of this stony spell, That holds me limb-bound, impotent of speech, Release its victim. Re-invigorate then, I shall upstart from slumber; and what joy, Waking, Helene love, to strike for thee, Rescue thy sire from death, thy land from shame, And cast myself and Traumberg at thy feet! Enter Corcilius. How now, Corcilius! Corcilius. Oh, my lord, my lord! Heinrich. What ails thee? Have the rascals mutinied? Corcilius. No, sir; but Proszkaâ Heinrich. Proszka! Is he dead? Corcilius. Ay, dead to honour, and buried in his shame. I have a secret message here from Traumberg; He hath cast loose allegiance, blown to heaven Wild-flying rumours of your Highness slain In some far forest, hunting of the boar, And by consent, or fear, of all men, seized The estates and lordship of your fair domain. Heinrich. Durst he do so? Thou seest, Corcilius, How these men rate me. To be flouted thus! Had I been banished, warred against, dethroned, Loathed for my deeds, yet dreaded, and at worst Not held as nothing in the scales of chance, Contemptuously put by, 'twere bearableâ Gall, but with honey mingled. Now all's flat And tasteless as the very dregs of shame. This is the verdict of the men of action On us mere dreamers! Well, there was a time When I had scarce breathed quicker, hearing it; Now, 'tis far otherwise. By Heaven! I reap These tares of mine own sowing. Corcilius. Dear my lordâ Heinrich. But does he think, because our soul forsooth Gasped not amid the mudbanks, where are hatched The creeping things of purblind policy, Therefore we cannot choke them in their slime, And knavery must go scathless? Corcilius. Now you speak Words, I pray Heaven to see take shape in act. When start we hence for Traumberg? Heinrich. When you will!â Nay, 'tis impossible! (Aside) The plot! the plot! Corcilius. Why, sir, what hinders you? Heinrich. O evil chance, That holds me prisoner here at Schlafenstein, While 'twixt the parting chariots of my fate Bound, like the traitor, I am torn in twain! Corcilius. A moment since your purpose had an edge Keen as to cleave these idle gossamers: What blunts it now? Heinrich. That which I may not breathe Even to theeâa spell potent as love, And absolute as honour. Corcilius. Nay, my lord, Honour, as I conceive it, is a power Within the breast, that keeps a man's heart true Both to himselfâhis future and his pastâ And the main current of external things; Not prone to swerve with every shifting gust, Nor, if the forward reach be dull to view, Lured to side-issues, where achievement bears No just proportion to his destiny. Heinrich. Corcilius, were some vessel to make port Freightless of all she sailed for, a mere hull, Leaving her priceless treasure to the gripe Of fierce marauders, when a timelier stay Had sealed her bargains, of what sane man's hope Were that the consummation? To go hence Heinrich without Heleneâ Corcilius. Then, here dies Allegiance, and here sickens to its death A life-long friendship. Even the noblest aim, Bought with betrayal of an earlier trust, Becomes ignoble, and may turn to loss Of that which was, and that which might have been. This Princess, if she love, will love a man, Not a man's picture. Since you fail yourself, She too may fail you. Look to it. Farewell! [Exit Corcilius. Heinrich. O irony of fate! So many years In folly's bog to flounder, by my friends Uncensured, till repentance call for praise! Well, he will know me better by-and-by. Enter Arnfeld. Arnfeld. Still here, and uncompanioned! I perceive Some thought disturbs you. Heinrich. Not so far beneath The surface, but your tongue may safely launch Its lightest word upon me. Arnfeld. I had rather It sank to your heart's deep than idly floated. Heinrich. Have you fresh tidings, then? Arnfeld. Nay, all is told. We are ready for worse crops of dragon-teeth Than yon rough soil can ripen; but one doubt I have that craves your counsel. Heinrich. What is that? Arnfeld. Whether 'tis safe to keep this treason locked In our own minds, or wiser to divulge it, At least to the Princess. Heinrich. Divulge it not. Let her first learn this peril was to pass When past and over. Arnfeld. There the lover spoke, And not the statesman. Nay, sir, pardon me; We are all lovers here of the Princess, With your good leave; so let not that affront you. How if we fail through sheer self-confidence? Unwarned, what hinders that they tempt not death Outside the circuit of our sentinels, While we lie ambushed idly? Heinrich. Nay, the thieves Have set their trap, and will abide their time, Nor for one victim risk the main revenge. Assume some danger, we may well forestall it. The Duke and Duchess seldom stir abroad; And, for their gracious daughter, if she stray Beyond our safeguard, as the time draws near, We must contrive some charm to lure her back. Arnfeld. Well, be it so. Heinrich. It is the smaller peril; Else love, more strong than prudence in her heart, Might wake her sire's suspicion, who would then, With torrents of wild speech or violent act, Blow to the wind both plot and counterplot, And so drive back to dangerous despair Whom secure hope had else made impotent. Arnfeld. Be it your charge, then, from to-morrow's dawn To mark the steps of our fair prisoner; I will attend upon their Highnesses. Now, if your leisure serve, we will together Draw from the range of o'er-observant eyes, And in my private chamber more at length Discourse the matter. Heinrich (moving off with Arnfeld). Gladly; let us go. Nine days from hence, he said? And you are sure The spy spake truth? Arnfeld. Nine days, and I am sure. [Exeunt. Enter Helene, Clarissa, and Corcilius. Helene (to Corcilius). Doubtless, but all this he has risked for meâ For me, you say, lost all. Corcilius. Madam, 'tis true. Helene. True! Then I most in all the world, methinks, Were graceless to upbraid him. Corcilius. You alone In all the world can win him back to honour. Helene. Tush, sir! I have no gift to plead with men Upon assumed devotion to myself. Hear what I have to say. We three ride hence This very hour for Traumberg. With your aid I mean to win this dukedom back again. Traitors are often cowards; it may be At sight of you he will disgorge his lie With what it purchased. You have friends, you say. Summon them; raise the city; let them know Heinrich is living. I myself will lead Their wives and sisters with what arms are oursâ Tears, prayers, reproachesâto uphold his cause. Triumph is certain. Oh, that we were there! Corcilius. Brave lady, I am with you. Clarissa. And I too. Helene. Go, then, with speed. Saddle Success for me, My palfrey for Clarissa; lose no time, But bring them to the forest unobserved; We shall await you at the parting ways. [Exit Corcilius. Go in, Clarissa, and what need requires, With frugal choice make ready for the road; Anon I shall be with you. (Exit Clarissa.) Oh, dear father! How will the tidings of my flight distress thee! How wilt thou weary for my home-return! Yet deem me not undutiful. God knows 'Tis from no lack of love to thee-ward; nay, Some power outside myself compels me hence With strange imperious mandate. It must be That I was born for this one deed. I yearn To act, to dare for others, and therewith, So my heart whispers, to thy life convey Some tributary stream of happiness, And end the dull stagnation of thy days. O breathing air! O waving branches! O Familiar sights and sounds of my loved home! With peace, with comfort, steal into his soul! Be, every hour, sweet messengers from me That we shall meet again, and meet with joy! Enter Duke. [Helene, retiring up palace steps, confronts the Duke. Duke. Helene! Helene. Father! [Embraces him, and turns to go. Duke. Must you leave me, then? Helene. Yes, for a littleâI shall soon be back. Heaven keep thee, father! Duke. And thee too, my child! [Slowly descends the steps. Exit Helene, gazing after him. The sun was shining but a moment since; How quickly 'tis o'erclouded!âHans, come hither!â Enter Hans with wheelbarrow. The days grow chill, methinks, and year by year Summer seems shorter. [Hans sets the barrow down by the Duke. What is in thy barrow? Hans. Stra', zire, to lay athirt the dahlia-roots, Lest they be nipt. We shall ha' vrost to-night. Duke. Well, and what else? Hans. Bezide the stra', your Highness? Nothen', excep', maybe, zome odds an' ends O' garden-stuffâa marrer, and zome carrots, 'Martyrs, ezekiel, an' the lik. Duke (looking under the straw). Thou knave! Enough to sup a score of starving folk! Hans. That's what they mid be vor, zoo please your Highness. Duke. So, we are robbed under our very noses By peer alike and pauper. Hans. Not but what I had the orders. Duke. Orders, knave!âfrom whom? Hans. From the Princess; God bless her gentle heart! Duke. Well, go your ways. Hans. Be I to teÃ¤ke 'em, zire? Duke. Eh?âwhat? Hans. Be these to goo along wi' I? Duke. Ay, if she bade thee. Say that they are welcome. [Exit Hans, with a low whistle of surprise. Enter Duchess. Duchess. There is some secret villainy afoot 'Twixt Arnfeld and the Forester. I marked them E'en now in closest conference together. If I know whom to trust in Schlafenstein, Never believe me. Duke. I am sick of it, And of myself, and all thy restless scheming. The fabric of our state is rottenness, A hollow trunk, that puts no branches forth, And yields no shelter to the passing foot, Wind-pierced and sapless, so that all who see Marvel why earth is cumbered with it. Duchess. Fie! What ails thee, dotard? Duke. Once my subjects loved me, I do remember: that was long ago, Ere we were married; then thou taughtst me pride; And pride bred hate, and hatred tyranny, And tyranny rebellion. We grew poor; That maddened me with a hot thirst for gold Cureless and quenchless; for what gold I win Slips through my hands like water. Out upon it! No love, no wealth, no honour, no content! Duchess. Comfort thyself that with increasing age Thy wealth of words increaseth. Duke. Thou canst taunt; But what of that, unless thou taunt us back To happiness and hope of prosperous days? In all my counsels thou hast borne a part; More than became me I have leaned on thee; That prop has failed. Canst thou for one poor plan Claim kindred with success? Who honours thee, Or trembles at thy bidding? Tell me that. Art thou not, even as I, scorned more than feared? Duchess. E'en so. To have fared otherwise, I must Have reigned alone, or mated with a man. I care not to dispute it, wasting breath, While through thy cowardice or blindness still The thief goes free, and Fortune from her throne Beckons in vain. Duke. 'Twere nearer truth to say, Misfortune beckons from Prince Rudolph's throne. Duchess. Ay, there it isâthe same soft waxen heart, Emasculate mind! It seems but yesterday I saw thee tottering on, Silenus-like, In weak and wanton chase of this same nymph, Whom now thou dub'st Misfortune; but a raw, Rebellious girl, whom thou mightst well have chid To duty, with a shower of sullen tears And wheedling voice bewitched thee, that the nymph Was straight transformed into a wrinkled hag. And then thou visitest the blame on me! But come! 'tis not too late. Bestir thyself, Shake off the spell, arise! draw in the net, Or ere it break, brim-full of golden scales! Send for Helene now; tell her she must Obey, or we disown her! Play the man! Duke. I thank thee for that word. I have sunk lowâ Ay, even to the beasts; but thou hast helped me To my old self. Thou bidst me sell my daughter, And play the man. I have enough of man Still beating here to answer thee âNo, no, By God! I will not.â Help, Helene, help! Enter hastily Arnfeld and Heinrich. Duchess. Eavesdropping, ha! Arnfeld. My lord, is aught amiss? Heinrich. What ails his Highness? Duke (to Arnfeld). Send for the Princess. Enter Kauz; Arnfeld turns to obey, but stops on seeing him. Kauz. My lord, the Princess is beyond recall By you or any else in Schlafenstein. I met her galloping for dear life, 'twould seem Toward the frontier. Duchess. Unaccompanied! Kauz. No, madam; but I dare not say with whom. Duchess. Answer, if thou be sane. Kauz. 'Twas with Corcilius, The friend of your good Forester. I speak But what mine eyes unwillingly beheld; Count Arnfeld, I doubt not, can tell you more. Heinrich. Villain, thy life shall answer for this lie. Duchess. So perish all my plans! Too late! too late! Duke. And I have nothing, nothing more to lose! [Sinks back, but is supported by Arnfeld. CURTAIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. LOVE IN A MIST. Scene same. Timeânine days later. Sunset. Duke discovered seated, with Arnfeld standing beside him. Heinrich at a distance, leaning against a stone urn. Duke. Another day passed, and no tidings yet! Arnfeld. The messengers have not returned, my lord; There is some hope in that. Duke. Less of despair To have heard nothing, than to hear the worst? Poor crumbs enow to stay heart-hunger on! Arnfeld. Yet crumbs lie only where the board was spread, And may be spread again. Were no clue found To follow, what should lengthen their delay? We may have news to-night. But you need rest; Let me conduct you hence. Duke. Well, lead me in: Though 'tis mere use, a blind mechanic law, When life is hateful, bids the body still Crave food and shelter. (Seeing Heinrich) What does he do here, Companion-fiend of him who stole my daughter, And robber of my gold, for aught I know? Back with him into darkness! [Ascending the steps. Arnfeld. Patience, sire! Karl never robbed you, nay, would deem earth's gold Too small a price to win your daughter back. Duke. O Heaven! 'tis here that I last looked upon her; Here she embraced me, as she went, and said âHeaven keep thee, father! I shall soon be back.â Soon! and how long since then?ânine endless years! Mock, if you will; I care not how you call themâ Years, months, or daysâwhat matters it, when sorrow Hath done a rape on time, and every hour Swells to the birth with some new load of anguish? Arnfeld. Nay, if the Princess said âI will return,â Live on her promise, who betrayed it never. Take comfort, sire, and all shall yet be well. [Exeunt Duke and Arnfeld. Heinrich moves slowly to the front, and sinks upon a seat. Re-enter Arnfeld. Arnfeld. I never loved that old man, ere to-day. Heinrich. I never hated the whole world till now. Arnfeld. Like Solomon, his wives have been his bane. Heinrich. What! is he wedded to more wives than one? Arnfeld. Yes, a stone woman, and a goddess, gold. Heinrich. So were his daughter a half human thing. Arnfeld. Ay, and the other half? Heinrich. Nine days ago I had said divine. Arnfeld. Nine days! do you remember? Heinrich. Ah! might I but forget it!âI who thought This day to save her from brute-enemies, And failed to save her from my bosom friend. Arnfeld. My love, being free from jealousy, is stronger Than your most just suspicion. To men's acts Who impute basest motives, err the most, As they the least, who noblest. May I still Count on your succour, should the rebels strike? Heinrich. If there be help in a despairing man, Whose sole hope is that they will strike at him. Arnfeld. To fight from such a motive were no better Than suicide by proxy. You lack patience To bide the storm, like some rash mariner, Who, terror-crazed, anticipating wreck From the sea's peril, leaps into the sea. Heinrich (rising). I am not of so staid a temper, sir, As in the crash of fate to bear myself Meek, passionless, persistent, self-contained; Nor, truth to tell you, can I comprehend What heart still animates your enterprise. This dukedom, ere the light went out of it, Seemed worth the saving, for her sake who shed Some beacon-brightness o'er the waste; but these Charred faggot-ashes, smouldering in their smoke, That once burned baleful, but are past rekindlingâ Why lock the sluice-gate that lets in the flood? Were it not better they were quenched outright? Arnfeld. Haply, but not through negligence of me. A crime may save a kingdom, a good deed Wreck it, for aught I know; but I know naught. I see but one step onward in the dark, Where the straight path is sundered into twain, Duty and treachery, and, beyond them both, Chaos, a dismal swamp, on treachery's side Scarred with red blotches and a lurid scum; And, wade or sink the sequel, here choose I Dutyâso habit sways our preferencesâ And trust to Heaven for stepping-stones. Farewell. Heinrich. There goes a better man than who stays here. What shall I do to kill the crawling hours? How stifle sense? with what oblivious spell Blind those o'er-watchful sentries of the soul, Remembrance and foreknowledge, and so quell The famine-pangs of empty-heartedness? Oh, for the secret of the charm that lulled Despair, that fiercer Cerberus in the breast, When Orpheus breathed his sorrow into song From twilight unto twilight!âOut, alas! I am no Orpheus, though my griefs are more; Yet might some mournful rhyme beguile my sadness. There are three things fair upon earth; may a fourth be found? The seed of song in the heart, of a flower in the ground; The third is the seed of love; shall there yet be shown A fourth thing fair upon earth, when these are flown? Sweet was the new-found gift of a voice to cry, When the pent soul sprang to the lips to sing or die; Well, but, O aching heart! what is left of it now?â The shame of a quenched desire, and a burning brow. A poppy shot up to the sun; 'twas of regal red, Floating on air seemed the disc of its delicate head; When the corn fell, what remained of its glory to cull?â Naught but a scant green stalk, and a naked skull. As we filled the loud air with our laughter, the silent with love, The hour was as swift, was as sweet, as the wings of a dove. Say, now, what is left of a joy that was earth's despair?â A thought, and a sigh, and a glance at the empty chair. There are three things fair upon earth; may a fourth be found? The seed of song in the heart, of a flower in the ground; The third is the seed of love, and a fourth shall be shownâ The soul of a man that endures when these are flown. Ah! 'tis but slender solace; let me sleep. [Sinks back on the seat. [The darkness has been gathering throughout this scene. Now ensues a pause, during which the moon rises. Enter the Duke, walking in his sleep, with bags of gold in his hand. Duke. Firm earth again, and in the self-same spot! But oh, how dizzy still! The gold, the gold! Yes, yes, I have it. Helene, thou! Heinrich. The Duke. Mad, mad, by Heaven! this grief has crazed his brain. Duke. That was not her sweet voice; but all is changed. Who led thee hither, flying, flying, flying, Through those long leagues of air? How cold it is! And the rough stones of yonder mountain-stair Have torn me. She is gone! am I alone? Nay, who is this? She-fiend, I left thee sleeping. Avaunt! or I will hurl thee from this ledge Into yon smoking chasm! The way is long; Give me your hand, my darling; why so, so. 'Tis here I bury it. You'll not betray me? See, see, what wealth below! but mark the stone, For I can ne'er remember, being old, And when I need most, cannot find the way. [Buries the gold. There, I have told the secret, and you promise Never to leave me.âArnfeld, thou are faithful; Do one last service, cover up the grave, And lead me hence.âIt was thy pride that killed her; If tears were pearls, I should be rich anon. Go tell Prince Rudolph I have changed my mind: He shall not have her; she is not for sale. Thou badst me sell the child, and God has bought her.â In that low pit my life, my treasure lies. [Exit. Heinrich. Not mad, but dreaming! Ha! what have we here? All the lost treasure! gold in heaps! a key That opes the door on Arnfeld's innocence! One problem solved, how strangely! and the otherâ Nay, hope not, Heinrich, for thy life's solution: Naught but eternity can undo that, So tangled by the fumbling hand of time. 'Twas pitiful, I trow, to hear him rave, Could pity flow in such a frost of scorn, As in one biting hour hath turned my tide From genial tropic to the frozen pole, And sunk the blood to zero. 'Tis sheer waste To send emotion gadding to the moon, Which should be stored for vital warmth within. Eat fat, my soul, and clothe thyself with fur, And in thy clay-built hovel house with beasts; So live, a mummy with the heart-tick heard, As do the wiser Lapps! Helene here Loved her old sire. What profits it?âa man, The heart of him so saturate through and through With lust of lucre, that his brain in sleep Hoards it from knowledge of his waking self! Did her love suck the poison from his soul? Corcilius was my friend. Friendship, a name For all that's brief and brittle, henceforth I deem No better than a vantage-coign, wherefrom To plant the secret dagger, and the clinch Of her close hand the snapping of a trap. Did my trust in him keep Corcilius true? âShe too may fail you: look to it,â said he, And with that bitter farewell seemed to add âAs I am false to you, and Proszka false, And all your subjects, as these wretched serfs To their more wretched master, as thyself To thine own self, and all men to each other.â Enter Helene unnoticed. And she did fail me! she who said âBelieve Whatever most is unbelievable, Rather than disbelieve the faith of friends.â Oh, Heinrich, thou art wound about thy throat With triple folds of treachery, hydra-formed, But faced as a fair woman; and though fortune Should give me back my country, and disprove Corcilius of unkindness, I shall never Pass from the shadow of my love's eclipse. Helene. Heinrich! Heinrich. Her ghost! Then, thou art dead, Helene! [Helene advances and touches him. Thy hand is warm, thou livest! I feel, I see thee! But where is thy false lover? Helene. Close at hand. Heinrich. Let him not step within my sword's revenge. Helene. Look to it truly, lest it prove for thee No better than self-slaughter. Heinrich. Not so surely, Unless his skill keep measure with his crimes. Helene. If faithless doubt were crimeful, so might he Challenge creation and not find his match. Heinrich. What! hath he flung thee from his heart love-cloyed So soon? Helene. I know not: I have come to see. Heinrich. I have no will to fence with thee in words: All this is idle. Say, wherefore didst thou leave us, And why returning addest scorn to scorn? Helene. Scant claim hast thou to ask; but I will answer. 'Twas for the sake of one who loved me well, To seek lost treasure. I have found the treasure, And lost the love. Heinrich. God help me! so have I. Helene. What scorn is there in this? what wrong to thee? Heinrich. I scarce can look into thine eyes and read A guilty soul behind them; yet believe me That by thine action thou hast slain belief, Slain love of man for woman, friend for friend, Slain awe, slain reverence, and what else beside Still breathed of heaven within this earth-bound breast. Helene. Am I so multiplied in villainies, So manifold a murderess? Then, slay me. Heinrich. Ah, if I dared! so might we die together. Helene. But why not live? (Aside) Was ever love so blind? Heinrich. So, the rich banquet of Corcilius failing, Heinrich's half-loaf is better than no bread! Helene. I cannot purge thy vision. Matched with thee Self-blinded Ådipus was Argus-eyed: By thy bleared sight Tiresias and the rest Saw keen as Lynceus; for their inward orbs, Through bodily darkness made more bright, beheld The viewless things of heaven and thoughts of men, Falsehood from truth discerning. Infidel! Hast thou forgotten what mad dance of doubt That will-o'-the-wisp Suspicion once ere now Led thee, and landed in what groundless mire, And how I chid thee to a nobler mind, When Arnfeld was the traitor? Now that I Myself am mark and target for the same Rash arrow-flight of censure, can I stoop To prove my own fame stainless, e'en to thee? Nay, though a breath should clear it. Many a mist Born of damp valleys hides the mountain-height, Which yet shows clear to heaven. Let the vain breeze, Which brought, disperse them; 'tis no mountain's work, Unless the cold pride of its virgin-peaks Condense and melt them into contrite showers. Heinrich. E'en so hast thou from thy pure height dissolved The cloud-belt that obscured thee. I must cleanse The sour waste places and low feverish haunts, Where the rank fumes are bred. Tell me no more; I do but ask one question: Canst thou pardon? 'Tis but in absence that my heart could doubt thee. Helene. Pardon is cheap; but how if doubt return, When the time comes for us to part again? Heinrich. When the time comes! Helene, could you knowâ Nay, but you must not. The poor forester Should worse offend by kneeling at your shrine, Than when he lifted impious hands against it. Helene. But what if this poor forester should prove Indeed âa peer of mickle trust and power,â Waiting the whisk of his good fairy's wand, To rid him of enchantment? Heinrich. Then, you know One-half the bitter secret of my life, And, come what will, Corcilius has betrayed me; But the other halfâOh, I have flung away A power deemed worthless, that were now worth all; As some rash diver, seeing gleam beneath The prize he sought for, madly might forsake His precious air-bell, pendent house of breath, Then feel his body through the stifling vault Borne upward like a bubble, far alike From treasure and retrieval. Helene. Are not you That Heinrich, Duke of Traumberg, whose dear friend You feigned yourself? Then, what strange words are these? How could you dare resign, lose, fling away That which, you living, must be yours or no man's? For what sly Jacob's savoury pottage-mess, So wrong your birthright? Heinrich. Then sink hope, and mount Despair! Heinrich I am, but Traumberg's Duke No longer; a deposed and outlawed man, Beggar and vagabond, a mean, beaten hound, That, skulking in dark corners, not for life Durst face the yelping kennel. Lash him back Homeward, and let the white teeth grin for scorn Before they tear him! 'Tis an ugly death. Helene. Heinrich, I may not for my father's sake Wed where I love, if love mean indigence; No needy vagabond must call me wife, Nor will I mate with a mean beaten hound. Therefore, unless yourself malign yourself, If you are that deposed, poor, outlawed man, From some base motive skulking out of sight, And not the noble heart and happy prince I hope and think you, then indeed has come The hour for parting, and our dream is o'er. Heinrich. It is, then, as I feared. Farewell, farewell! Wife, friend, and dukedom, lost and gone for ever! Helene. But, Heinrich, on what errand, think you, bound, Corcilius and Clarissa rode with me, To seek for what lost treasure? Come, divine. I know not why you paused inactive here, Stirring no finger to redeem your own, When the mere tidings of the truth in Traumberg, Blown from our lips, so fierce a tempest woke As straightway wrecked the liar upon his lie; But I believe 'twas no ignoble sloth Or weak love-sickness held you. Heinrich. God forgive me! Who for a season, made me first of fools, To prove thee still his maiden-miracle! Helene. If it be so, though I deny your doctrine, You must be orthodox, and doubt no more Of miraclesâAh! here they come! See now, I give you back your dukedom and your friend. Heinrich. And not my wife? [A trumpet heard. Ah! wait, and I will win thee. Enter Corcilius and Clarissa. Clarissa and Corcilius, there have been Thoughts in my heart, while ye were absent yonder, Which will demand forgiveness, but not now. (Aside to Corcilius) Be on your guard! Danger is imminent Within the palace. I must hasten thither; The safety of our dear ones rests with you. [Uproar heard in the palace. Enter Duke and Duchess, flying for their lives, pursued by Kauz and others. By heaven! 'twill be too late. Helene. Oh, save my father! [Corcilius draws Helene and Clarissa into shelter. Heinrich rushes forward, and keeps the conspirators at bay, till, Arnfeld arriving with his men, Kauz is secured, and the rest driven back into the palace. Arnfeld (returning) All are secured, shut fast in their own trap. I marvel how this villain and his dupes Pierced through the palace-walls, except they know Some secret postern, or have friends within. This should be looked to. Kauz. Ask the Duchess, fool. Duchess. Friends, I confess it to my shame, this man Was hired by me, gulled with his slanderous lies, To spy upon Count Arnfeld, in my folly Deeming him faithless, by whose loyal aid With your true friendship, sir, we are saved to-day. At length, impatient of his idle questing, For closer observation I unlocked The secret of a dark and tortuous way, With subterranean outlet, known to none Beside ourselves; and, as in wayward sickness, Taking sound medicine to be deadly bane, Called Death himself within the doors, to plot Against my doctor. I am taught in time. Arnfeld (to guards). Take him within, and look you guard him well. [Exeunt guards with Kauz. Duke. Sir, you have saved my life, which, though indeed A doubtful gift, I scarce were loth to part with, Yet for the giver's sake claims gratitude. Take, then, my thanks, and with them what beside, As from a bankrupt and a broken man, 'Tis mine to offer. Heinrich. I have news to tell, Should make life worth the living. Duke. What! say what! Heinrich. Your Highness is no bankrupt, but the lord Of rich revenues, the recovered sum Of all your treasure lost in Schlafenstein, A very mine of gold, whereof by chance I was the happy finder. Duke. Then, take that. Heinrich. Forgive me, sire, but that is not my suit. I ask a nobler guerdon at your handâ Your dear-loved daughter. Duke. If you are not mad, You should be gentler than to flout my sorrow. Oh, lost Helene, wheresoe'er you stray, By misery banished, or by hope beguiled, Though time and distance like a gulf divide us, Grief knows no distance; love can laugh at time. Let grief and love my wingÃ¨d carriers be; Recall your parting promise, and come back! Heinrich (crossing stage, and leading Helene forward). Your prayer is answered. Helene. Father! Duke. She is come! Duchess. Daughter, the crabbed text of your departing Is scarce unriddled by your home-return. Helene. Patience, good mother. Chide not till you know. Heinrich. Now, sire, I claim your promise. Duke. This sweet hand, Meet for the noblest, is not mine to give, E'en to the man that saved her father's life, Except she bid me. I am so distraught, And sorrow's waves so boisterously have tossed me To this high beach of joy, that I am fain To doubt my senses. Sir, unfold yourself. You are a wizard, and my foresterâ What more, I know not. Heinrich. But an hour ago I must have answered âa poor vagabond;â But thanks to this dear maid and brave Corciliusâ Corcilius. No thanks, then, to Clarissa? Heinrich. Not so fastâ And fair Clarissa, I am Duke of Traumberg. Duke, Duchess, Arnfeld. The Duke of Traumberg! Heinrich. To make short my story, When fortune led me hither, tired of state, Filled with dark broodings, and, though free to roam, A self-incarcerate captive, soul-immured, Then, first, the light of your sweet daughter's eyes Broke on my prison-darkness; and anon Her angel-virtue, gliding to my side, Touched me; the chains fell off; I rose and walked A freeman. Helene. Heinrich, at this jog, methinks, Your journey will prove endless. Duchess. Tell us how You lost your dukedom. Arnfeld. Ay, and how regained it. Corcilius. And what was the strong power that held you here Spell-fettered from regaining it yourself. Clarissa. And where you found the treasure; for Corcilius Still taunts me with the theft. Heinrich. Madam, to you I answer, by the treachery of a friend, And heaven's requital of my past supineness. Arnfeld, to you, by loyalty and grace Of a true man and of a matchless lady. To you, Corcilius, knowledge of the plot, Which love and duty bade me stay to hinder. And to you, fair inquisitor, but this, That within reach, yet out of risk, it lies, By stealth conveyed, although no thief purloined it. Duke. Stay further question: I will never know Where lies that treasure. You shall tender half To Arnfeld's faithful keeping, who, empowered With what best wisdom may be brought to aid, Shall spend or spare it for our own country's weal. One-half the rest shall loose the strands of dearth, Whereof Rebellion twines her knotted scourge; The other take you for our daughter's dowry. The heart is yours, and let the hand go with it. Duchess. I can but say, amen. Prince Rudolph's suit, That towered so nimbly to so fair a tree, Is fallen, or blasted by war's thunderbolt, Or nipt and withered by the frost of scorn Helene could not for that loss, I deem, Find worthier quittance. Corcilius. May it further please Your Highnesses, amid the general joy, To think of poor Clarissa? Helene. What says she? Clarissa. Rather than from her old dear mistress part She will e'en stoop to her new master's man. Duke. Well, let us in. Arnfeld. And these poor prisoners? Duchess. They must be dealt with ere we go to rest. Duke. Nay, nay, to-morrow. I must first take counsel With Heinrich and Helene. Duchess. Be it so. Corcilius. Pshaw! I shall give up landscape, and learn heads. Clarissa, will you be my model, sweet? Clarissa. Ay, if you paint me thus. [Laying her head on his shoulder. Helene. You foolish creatures! Clarissa. We stand rebuked, dear lady; but example Were more than precept. Heinrich. So, then, I perceive Art is not all, art's fruit indeed the essence Of the whole sum of man, his best and worst In thought and act and suffering, thrice distilled, A cordial for all time: and yet 'twere better To live the virtue and live down the vice, And be, do, suffer, what we play, paint, sing, Than sing, or paint, or play them. Helene. 'Tis e'en so; But why not both, my darling? Heinrich. We will try. THE END.</field>
