This Haschish dream, this cup-rose heavy-leaning With opium's weight, this drunkenness of soul, Bizarre, grotesque, satiric, with strange scroll Of flaunting fancy's wildest floriage screening No plashy depths of philosophic meaning, Scoffing, believing, laughing at life's dole, From heart that bleeds the while to death's dear goal, Take, friend,‚Äîmy own, from no man's field a gleaning. For I have made myself a clean new mould To pour my fancies in, of mad burlesque, Yet full of death withal as charnel air.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. ‚ÄîThe Enchanted Castle of Elzir on the Hidden Island of Cephalonia. Elzir. It is the fateful day. At dawn, when first Hermadon before his birth dwelleth in Cephalonia with the Queen of Beauty and Holiness. The morning blew her heart's curled petals ope, In crimson efflorescence of new love, And in the goblet of her flower-like clouds Received the chaliced liquor of the sun, Drenching the dewy coral leaves with life, There came o'er the red wave from Avalon, Between the flamy lips of sea and sky, Making a severance of their rounded kiss, Fanned by an odorous wind, a swan-like barque With golden sails, the same that touched our isle But one short hundred years agone; her crew The same young fairy knights that bore thee hence On that last venture. Music wakened me. Hermadon is fated to descend to earth every hundred years. I rose, and from the eastern tower looked forth Under the gable, o'er the flushing sea Toward the orient. There the day was rent, And from the cleft, the gorgeous gash of cloud, Issued a sail. The sky had vermeiled it With her own grain, a garnet red as blood, But paler than the garnet of the dawn: Then the light struck it, when, chameleon-like, It touched on notes of half the rainbow-scale; Rose, orange-scarlet, tawny, amber, gold, And golden lay on the sea's flattering glass Coquetting with its image. For the wind That kissed the bosom of the heaving sail Was fa√´ry, and where the galleon rode Curled not one vitreous wavelet of the flood; But round the hull two diamond streaks of surge Flashed lightnings back to the gold-glancing blades Of cadenced oars that danced over the deep. And nigher and nigher down the blood-bright track, Where the sun strewed red purples for her way, A widening wavy drapet, as she came, Clearer and clearer came the fairy music, Sweeter and richer swelled the fairy voices That woke me, farther heard than mortal strains: Till at the last the smooth and silken sail Brake into creases, and the crumpled gold Was brailed up to the golden yard, and furled Close on our island. Herm. Well I know it, love. I spied her vane and flaunting gonfalon Above the last abuttal of the land, Forth-setting with my hounds, e'en where she lay On the creek's glassy bosom, by the wood, High up the outreached armlet of the sea, And knew the hour was come. Elzir. Alas! dear love, I grudge thee to rude mortals. They will read Heaven's fadeless glory on thy built-up brows, The natural and pardonable envy of the vulgar towards a poet. Un-sorrow-tarnished, alabaster-white, And on thy cheeks, unfurrowed by a tear, Youth's florid gladness creeping purply through: And seeing thee thus wise, and fair, and glad, Foam into madness, and spit poisonous sleet, The wild-boar spittle of hate grown rancorous, Squirt acrid venom through the fastened fangs Of envy and pollute the fountful wells Of life with slander's rank corrosive juice, And joy-forbidding monk's-hood, saintly chrism, Thrice stilled and filtered through the hypocrite's heart. Herm. I would thy scale of grief hung lightier, queen, Though mine were therefore heavier; but thy love I would have balance mine, nor more nor less. Elzir. O love, the balance of love is not true, But poised against the woman: else no pair Of lovers were at even, nor could draw With equal necks the golden yoke of life; So far more precious is a woman's love. Herm. 'Tis true the heap√®d jewels of thy grace Outweigh my heart's best corals with pure pearl, My silver grit with granules of chaste gold: So to be straight with you and mend the weight, I throw my faith into it. Elzir. Oh, that's lightest! Thou wilt be drinking from some mortal's lips Love's giddy nectar of mixed sighs and prayers; Yea, sucking honey from some mortal flower, Letting faith's fady roses drop their leaves In the heart's heavenly corner, there to rot, Ere thou be gone an hour hence from the hive. Herm. I swear it. Never! Elzir. By thy knightly vow? Herm. Ay, by my knightly vow and Christian soul! Elzir. Then thus I set my girdling guardian love E'en in the rondure of this glamoured gold Upon thy finger. Herm. Thus I kiss thy gift Hermadon swears never to put earthly Love before the love of Beauty. And swear to be true ever. [Music. Hear you softly Between the tree-stems on the ebbing wind, Borne through the wood's green twilight to our ears, A most delicious music‚Äîfluty tones Of flageolets, clear clarions mellowed down By distance, and faint tappings of the drum, Like dim dream-music? Elzir. Ay, for now they come Fairy knights and ladies come to arm him for his birth. To arm thee for thy birth. Herm. Ah, me! that strain I heard it once before, but when or where Cannot recall. Elzir. An hundred years ago, On thy last voyage to the world of men. Enter two Pages leading Steeds. 1st Page. Thy steed Gelwedrun, of enchanted race, No mortal strain in all his flume of blood, He is provided with Wrath. Chief of the fairy horses of Isaie, Bestrode by C√¶sar homeward-bound from Gaul, By other mortal never, Morgue the Fay Sends for thy use, thus barbed and spiked with gold. Herm. Thou shalt be as the anger of my soul, For with the storm-wind force of passion thou Shalt bear me to mine ends; but I, thy lord, With knees of will and bit of sharp restraint Shall rudder thee and rule thee. Elzir. Morgue the Fay Sends thee this other, white as snow in cloud, That never kist base earth. Herm. I'll call thee Love, And spotless keep as now thou'rt given me. Also with Love. Enter two beautiful Maidens bearing a Cuirass, another with a Helmet, and a third with a Shield. 1st Maiden. This habergeon of beaten burnished gold, With Self-Approof. Graved and embossed with mystic hieroglyphs, Thy mistress sends, and bids thee serve the right. 2nd Maiden. And set this globy morion on thy head, Fire-new, still beaming from the furnace-kiss. With Self-Belief. Lo! white as glass, the crystal-polished gold Shines more like silver! Wear it for her sake. 3rd Maiden. And hang this sun-bright mirror on thine arm, With the clearness of Intellectual Vision to see and show things as they are. To daze thy foes with likeness of themselves And with the brightness of intolerable truth. Enter a fair young Knight bearing a Sword and a Lute. Knight. And this to strike with, cruel ice-blue steel, With Satire and Logic. More nimble-swift and pliable than thought, And that for song with strings of phantasy. With Song. Elzir. And now, farewell; for see the swan-drawn boat, The fairy pinnace, the bright galley's child, Tarries for thee to bear into the world. O unborn soul! be faithful to thy fate. Thou hast my pledge: thou goest not unarmed. Say not, when they that spare not, or abase By sparing, thrust at thee with venomed fangs, That weaponless or weaponed yet unwarned Thou wentest from us earthward. Take this kiss, And bear it stainless on thy lips through life. Herm. Farewell, O love! the giddy dream comes on: Hermadon is born into the world. I swoon into new life: I cannot stay: The shore slips from me: O my love, farewell! Scene II. ‚ÄîThe Lists near Amanda's Castle. Aman. Proclaim the tourney. Let the just begin; For God shall send a champion; doubt it not. Herald. In Balder's name I challenge all spurred knights, The Philistine blasphemeth Love. Whomso it list gainsay his word, who says She that men call Amanda, queen of Troy, Is no true queen, but a base harlotry, Be-painted and be-kist of belamours, Bosomed in wantonness and lapped in lust: In proof whereof there lies his knightly gage. Aman. What! shall it lie unlifted? Of my knights Will none darrain the battle in my right?‚Äî You, good Sir Percivale? Sir Percivale. I crave you grace. On me hath Slander set her chiefest seal, Which so to battle were to set my print And signet to. Aman. Then let the trumpet sound! Let strangers reap the glory. [Fanfare of trumpets. Aman. Look, Eulice. Who comes? Eulice. I see nor hear no sight or sound. Aman. Then sound again! [Fanfare, and answering blast. Eulice. I hear a winded horn Close in the woods. Aman. A third time put your breath Into the brazen tube. Heaven helps the right. [Fanfare. Whom see you now? Eulice. One on a piebald horse, Clarimonde cometh mounted on his hobby. With brisket all bemired and neck befoamed With riding hard, comes hither from the woods. Enter Clarimonde. Clar. Who is the challenger of this day's just? He desireth a man to fight withal. Aman. Sir Herald, pray you read again the charge. Her. In Balder's name I challenge all spurred knights, Whomso it list gainsay his word, who says She that men call Amanda, queen of Troy, Is no true queen, but a base harlotry, Be-painted and be-kissed of belamours, Bosomed in wantonness and lapped in lust: In proof whereof there lies his knightly gage. Clar. Thou faitour knight! thus do I lift thy gage, Clarimonde taketh up the cudgels out of pure meddlesomeness. And for thy leasing hurl it in thy teeth. Fight, caitiff, or be choked with thine own lie! Bald. That will I. Reach me hither my good lance. [They take their places at opposite ends of the lists. Aman. Sound, herald! Clarimonde hath a brush with the Philistine, and cometh off the worse. [Fanfare. They tilt, and Clarimonde is unhorsed. Hath Heaven forgotten truth? Yet, valiant knight, thou shalt not bleed to death. [She descends towards Clarimonde. Bald. Lo, this was one that fed her lusting eyes With belgards and with kisses. Kiss him now. Aman. Lift up the aventail, that he may breathe. Unclench the brassart of the sword-arm. See! 'Twas here he took the point. Good master leech, Brail up the wing of this poor wounded hawk. 'Tis a good wound: he took it for the right. Bald. Heaven knows, and hath decreed it otherwise. But that all men go hence assured hereof, Sound again trumpet. Once more, come who will, I'll prove upon his body this man lied. [Fanfare; answer at a distance. Aman. Eulice, whom see you? I see nought. Eulice. Lo, queen, There comes a boat adown the river-sweep, Piloted by three swans, and one therein Bright like a fairy warrior, cased in gold. Heaven sends thee thy deliverer. Offer thanks. Enter Hermadon in the boat. Aman. Welcome, fair sir; you come in happy hour If you would fight with traitors and false knights That blow upon my name and rule my land. Herm. It pains me, queen, to dip my spotless sword In blood of bourders and base recreants That gird at chastity, and through the world Do high oppression on the weak and poor. Where is the man? Aman. Yonder the villain stands. Herm. What! with the blazoned shield and knightly arms? Aman. The same. Herm. Cast off that gear for very shame, Or do submission to thy lady queen, Swear fealty and homage. Bald. Sir, be merry! Herm. Seem I to you as merry? I am sad. Bald. A coward's sadness on the verge of fight. Herm. I grieve to be a knight, to wear the spurs, To wield the sword, for knighthood is abased. Bald. Then put the spurs off. We thirst not for blood. Herm. Peace, vaunter. Busk thee for the fight or yield. [They take their places. Aman. Sound, heralds. Hermadon destroyeth the Philistine. [Fanfare. They tilt, and Balder is easily unhorsed. Aman. Spare him, for he spared our friend. Herm. It is too late. High justice hath been done. All men take warning by this churl's offence And by his chastisement. So scoffers end Who gibe at grace and knighthood. Take him hence. And you, fair queen, I am your guest this night. To-morrow we will set your realm at peace, And pass upon our journey. Aman. Come away And banquet with us after this fair fray. Scene III. ‚ÄîThe Hall of Amanda's Castle. A banquet spread. Amanda, Hermadon, Clarimonde, Chauntval, Eulice seated. Jester seated on the steps of the dais. Soft music. Aman. Pour out the creamy beverage of blue grapes, The purple ferment mantling with dim snow, Our choicest wine, mellowed by ripest suns, And stored a century in icy vaults Under our castle. Spice the grace-cup well In honour of this day's deliverance. But none save virgin metal suits thy lips, Our holy champion, nor shall lip of ours Touch the gold rim ere thou with sacred kiss Hast given an unction to the warm√®d cup For us who shall come after. Chaun. Nay, fair queen, Chauntval offers his views upon Love. Thou robbest him of half the sweet. Which couch, Think you, a lover would the sooner kiss, That where his love has slept or is to sleep? Let the sweet brim be wet with thy fair lips; I warrant thee our champion drinks no worse. Herm. Sweet lady, drink or drink not of the cup, Hermadon has other views of Love. I shall with no base lip or thought profane Thy kiss upon it, nor love it best unkist. Chaste to the chaste, and chaste lips oft have met In holy chapels, by the altar's candles, Under the smiling saints, as pure as they; Nor can the Devil himself find room between The close salute of holy hearts and hands. Taste thou the cup. Aman. I pass it next to thee. Herm. And I, fair dame Eulice, must crave you grace For courtesy that breeds discourtesy. Jester. Fair dame Eulice, sire, hath a liquorish mouth, And knows not if to thank thee or to chide, Who keepest back the wine and lipp'st the cup. Aman. Peace, mannerless; you make our guest to blush. Jester. So would Eulice, I warrant! Aman. Fair Eulice. Eulice. Thanks, queen; I am not thirsty. This for love. There touched my lip. Chaun. I shall not miss the place. Jester. And afterward change plates with her, and pick Jester reproveth Chauntval for coarse passion. The clean-picked bones put by upon one side. 'Tis well for fools that God made women. Chaun. Why? Jester. They make all men so like us. Chaun. Then you lose Your privileges. Jester. No, there's room for more; And chiefly poets, gentle troubadour. Chaun. Friend, take the cup. [Chauntval gives the cup to Clarimonde. Jester. See how he turns it round Jester reproveth Clarimonde for absence of coarse passion. To find a clean place. Fetch a napkin, sewer, To wipe the love off for Sir Clarimonde! Aman. Sir Clarimonde shall pay us for his scorn With his sweet voice; and thou, Sir Troubadour, For that the knight drank after thee, shalt sing After the knight. Fetch me a lute. [Attendant brings in a lute and gives it to Clarimonde. Clar. Thanks, boy. List, I will sing thee of the old fay knights And ladies say, whom all men now deem dead But I and some few more, whose lifelong quest Is sworn upon the Holy Sepulchre To find them. The Ballad of Avalon. Once in a dream I sailed afar, Out on the ocean far away, In a magic barque to the evening star, Past burnished gates of the closing day, Till I heard the surge and saw the spray (White on the loadstone rocks it shone), Heard trumpet blare and war-horse neigh There in the castle of Avalon. And I drave my skiff on the rocky bar, And over the drawbridge took my way, And in at the door, that stood ajar, Gazed on the hall in the wan moon-ray. There sat Ogier by Morgue the Fay, And Huon, crowned, by Oberon, And Oriande and the sad Isaie, There in the castle of Avalon. There Lancelot rests from scath and scar, And hears in dreams the clarions bray, And Arthur leaves the heathen war To list to Tristram's virelay. And there is the Hid Isle's queen, who lay With Alexander of Macedon, And lured stern C√¶sar to her play, There in the castle of Avalon. L'ENVOY. In jewelled arms and rich array They sit, and let the years roll on. Ye deem them dead: they live for aye, There in the castle of Avalon. Aman. A sweet song. I were lief to deem it true. But what is she, the queen of the Hid Isle? Clar. Somewhere across green leagues of sea, and hid The quest of Clarimonde. Upon a land of myrrh and ambergris, In a network of labyrinthine streams, There is a spot: men call it the Hid Isle, For he who chances on it, and departs, May never more trace back thereto. The hills, The marshes, and the rivers, and all signs Or landmarks seem to slip and shift each hour; And in the isle there dwells a lady fay Who hath eternal life. Men speak of her As wedded to the lord of Macedon, And after to the good knight C√¶sar. Thither, To win that lady fay and deathless life, My quest is sworn. Jester. I wish thee a good journey. The Jester disbelieves in the existence of Beauty. Lo, here's one bound for nowhere all his days! Clar. Thrice have I been in Spain, in Africa, Clarimonde hath hitherto failed in the quest. And Britain, and in Asia farther east Than Babylon, nigh which, in a weird wood, Sir Huon, whom I sang of, met the dwarf Whose hair is yellow at three hundred years, The fairy Oberon; and I have seen High ventures in the realm of infidels, But found no magic dame nor hidden isle. Herm. How know you if the lady be for you? Perchance she hath her choice. Perchance there be Who see, and who see not, with glamourous eyes, To know enchantment from dull sense. Clar. Sir Knight, I know not if I be of chosen men, Nor if these eyes would know her if they saw. But this I know‚Äîby seeking 'tis we find If we are fit to find: and still I seek, And, if by any manner toil I may, Find her I will. Herm. And doth thy spirit-sense Whereof Hermadon pointeth the cause, a poet is born, not made. Tell thee no surer tidings? They who fare Upon this highest quest should throughly search Their purg√®d souls if they be fit or no. Then, welling from the unfathomable soul, The quickening fount of fire shall surge, and mount With swift reverberant answer‚ÄîThou art fit, Thou chosen; go thou straight to the Hid Isle. The hills are fast; the path is smooth as day; Thou canst not miss thy road. But otherwise Forswear the venture. Wherefore waste thy days Wandering in pathless voids of sea and land? Thou shalt not reach the isle. Thy soul's impure, Not with impurity of fleshly deeds (Which thou wert better have), but quenched with doubt, That blinds her visual beams. Thou art of earth, And all thy plodding shall avail thee nought. Jester. Here's one fool bound for nowhere, and another Ready to show the way. My trade grows common. Clar. Art thou too of us? Or hast won the goal To speak so surely? Stint thy warnings, friend. Thou canst not keep the quest so to thyself; We must go onward though we may not win. Aman. And thou, Sir Troubadour, hast thou no song? Chaun. Reach me the lute, fill me a cup of wine, Chauntval offers his views on Art. Rose-red or of the proper grapy hue. I must have fire-wells in my veins to sing! Let tingling wine in riotous ferment romp And rage along the swollen channels first, Enter my brain, and fill it with vague sound, Like multitudinous cities heard afar O'er moonlit seas. Who with unpurpled lips Sings waterish songs of spiritual Avalons, I hold no poet, though he be true knight. My strain shall be of women and of wine, Of close embraces under blushing moons In rose-gardens or by the fabled Nile, With full-fleshed beauties; of the mountains trod By madding M√¶nads naked to the waist, That strew the ridges with their lovers' bones; Or I will sing you a sweet song I heard In Syria. 'Twas a Turkish damsel sang it, Whose fingers, stained with soft alkenna tints, Beat on the timbrel, a wild dancing-girl, Chief of the Almai. 'Tis of a youth Unto a sweet Circassian infidel Reading the Alkoran, too much for sport, Too little in faith and love. I have it! Thus:‚Äî Young Aladinist of visionary glories, Brushing with thy golden curls the Alkoran, Say what dreamest thou, what strange sweet stories Of the houris and the soul of man? Wouldst thou with the houris too be reckoned, Paradise were near: Men would die if you but beckoned, Cassalmire! Dreamst of lamp-lit gardens in enchanted valleys, Pillars of amandola and agate stone, Starry vistas, glimpses of gold alleys, Avenues of arches diamond-strown, Tinsel foliage of rattling metals, Gold and copper sere, Flowers that sprout with jasper petals, Cassalmire? Roofed arcades, long labyrinths of crystal porches, Babylonian gardens swaying by gold chains, Fumes of ambergris and sandal torches, Melody of immeasurable strains, Rivers rustling o'er green grail of beryl, Slipping over sheer Glassy diamond crags of peril, Cassalmire? Round thy palace palms arise and tree-ferns feather, Gorgeous tropics chant by day and roar by night; Scarlet orchids chain the trunks together, Arches of loose-trellised parasite. Silken skeins of creepers droop and cluster, Cactus-prickles rear Tassels of vermilion lustre, Cassalmire! Glossy glaucous leaves shot through with silver patches, Hung like burning lamps with globes of green-gold fruit: Swaying nests, where the wild halcyon hatches Her high hopes beyond low Care's pursuit: Brims of rivers starred with golden aster, Flat leaves on the mere, Waxen cups and alabaster, Cassalmire! Bee-like birds, that ruffle through the thorny tangles Emerald feathers shot with dazzling coral gleams, Crests of saffron specked with orange spangles, Bright as beamy rainbows, swift as dreams; Ever through the dusk air they illumine, Like chameleons clear, Shifting colour, glinting, glooming, Cassalmire! Give me wings that I may follow thy swift vision, For I fail and faint behind thee on thy flight: Lift me hence up into thine Elysian, Into thinner ether, stranger light. I would see what lightning-fronted seraph, Winged with thought and fear, Stoops for thee across Al Araaf, Cassalmire! Aman. And thou, Sir Stranger Knight, my champion, I crave thee of thy courtesy a song. But be it somewhat other than thy speech, Less like a mist-enfolden mountain-peak Ensanguined with the blood of dawn and eve, A beauteous sword sheathed up in mystery And scabbarded with spiritual words, More savouring of earth and earthly love, That we, who are of earth and not of heaven, And quickened with earth's love, may fathom it. Herm. The stream tastes ever of its source, fair queen, Hermadon's views of Art. The river of the stream, and you shall find Both icy from their native mountain-snow, Or tepid from their bubbling mineral-wells. My song (or no song else) with current clear, Above all, it must be sincere for good or for evil. Doubt it not, lady, shall flow from my heart, As silver or as tawny as the fount Is pure or turbid, no whit more or less, Save as it gather soil from either bank Through mire and marish, or, as with new blood, Be fed with life by tributary streams, And lightened by the moonbeams and the stars. My song shall savour of my destiny In this strange world, and of that other life Before the womb, before oblivion. Have patience with me if my song be sad. There came a river out of the high snow: But the purest Art is impossible in a corrupt age. There came a knight down from another world: Most diamond-clear, it paced with even flow: And close he kept his heart's warm petals furled. The flowers were gladdened as with tears of God: Men lifted up their hearts from the dead dust: It left an Eden wheresoe'er it trod: He made love's Paradise in wastes of lust. But as the banks be, such the stream must grow; And as the world is, so the heart shall be: With death and pestilence it marked its flow: He through the world spread the world's misery. Aman. Is then the world so evil no pure thing Can live in it and yet keep pure? so cruel It turns to cruel the most pitiful? Herm. Nay, queen, for thou art in it. Chaun. Deftly flattered! The earth begins to taint thee, and small harm! For to what end this monstrous severance Of flesh and spirit? Herm. Sir, there be in whom Spirit and flesh, and flesh with spirit wed So closely, each by other purified, That through them throbs one single rhythmic life With organ-tones and loftiest majesty: But as the world is, so the heart becomes; And each man hath his world, the which in some Makes sharp division 'twixt the soul and flesh, Filling the one with cruelty and remorse, A maniac with the soul for manacle To guide and bind it. Chaun. I know nought of this. Herm. The happier thou. Clar. The quest hath taught it me. Aman. Come, friends, our talk grows sad and serious. Follow me to the gardens. Bring the lute. And you, sir seneschal, your choicest wine Place in cool flagons 'neath the twilight trees In the frescades, kept safe from sun or moon. We will be merry. Come, Sir Hermadon!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. ‚ÄîThe Garden of Amanda's Palace. Elzir. Here will I hide me 'mid these myrtle shrubs, The Queen of Beauty watcheth her chosen with jealousy. And watch the passage of their loves. You spirits That dwell in viewless odours and vague lights, And loiter ghostlike through the labyrinths Of the pale leaves and colourless floriage On wings bedewy with the breath of night; And ye that people the moon's scattering rays And the thin stellular beams of crowded heaven, Kissing the lake's face with a golden kiss On all her dimples, leaving rapid prints Of hurrying footsteps down the running stream, And making massy shade in the deep coigns Of every buttress mirrored in the moat, Have so becharmed the hour and drenched with love All winds, and sights, and echoes of the night, That human frailties now, like all wild beasts, Come forth from nestling in the heart's recess To prey and roam. Now is his feeble hour: Now let strong Virtue shield from weak Love's power. Chorus of Spirits. Spirits we of sound and fragrance From the everglades and streams, Roaming minstrels, fairy vagrants, Bringing love, and bringing dreams. Garth and garden's sleepiest posies We have sipped, and with us bear Drowsy smells of rich corn-roses, Droning noise of wings in air. Dreamlike transient evanescence Of delight is on our wings; Now the heart's full efflorescence! Now the burst of bubbling springs! Enter Hermadon and Amanda. Herm. I have no heart for it. Aman. No heart for love? For love, whose tears make sorrow smile? Herm. No tears For piteous love, no smiles for woe's relief Have I, who may not love nor sorrow. Aman. What? Nor love nor sorrow‚Äîand a mortal man! Herm. Not as the world loves or the world grieves may I. Aman. Love not and grieve not as men love or grieve, For they change ever; but love only me. Grieve only when I slight thee, which shall be Never: so never grieve; or, if thou must, Grieve but for pity of excessive love, Because it cannot be put out by tears, With kisses slaked, or close embraces fed, But ever more with fever and fell thirst And ravening wolfish famine must be torn The soul that feels the Dipsas-bite of love. For what close bonds can quench the insatiable will, The self-escaping heavenward flame of love, Save that I were incorporate made with thee, One flesh in truth‚Äîah no! one spirit as light As the high-soaring lark, the swift-winged prayer That the earth offers up unto the sun? Herm. To bring the cureless back to healthsome hues, Love is an aspiration, and aspiration is of its very nature illimitable. To quench the unquenchable, and limits fix To the illimitable soul of man,‚Äî Aspiring after freedom and full scope To soar about the circles of the heavens On angel's wings, a seraph-soul fulfilled Of thought and self-approof and perfect will, A cherub bathed in love,‚Äîis but to heap Dry fodder on the ravin of fierce fire, Which no man tames nor any shall feed full. Aman. Yet dip thy finger in the streams of heaven, And touch my parched tongue with a moment's peace. Herm. Of heaven's rills shall no man give to drink, E'en though he quaff himself. Aman. What! play the churl With love, and save it in a miser's coffer! Herm. No wilful miser, not of love, but peace. Of love thou hast enough; surcease of love No mortal can give another peace. Is that thou wouldst, and I have not to give. Aman. Hast not to give! Yet take this token-ring And be my knight. Herm. A sweet sense steals on me, Hermadon feeleth the power of Love. A starry influence, a mystic lure, Slanting upon me from the mellowing moon And sealing up mine eyes with kisses. Sweet, I'll be thy knight who may not be thy lord. Put on the ring. Aman. Here by this other one. Herm. That other! What? How came it on my hand? Whence gotten? By whom given? A thought strikes fire, Some keen refracted ray of shattered light From memory's twisted mirror. Take thy ring: He recalleth dimly his vow and his destiny. I cannot be thy knight. Aman. Nor love, nor knight? Herm. I cannot. Yet my heart says, Wherefore not? How am I born a slave, bound, fettered, gyved, Not free as other men? Aman. What! art thou sworn Never to love (rash vow!), or wedded, is it? And yet forgetful who thy bride may be, It is so long ago, and thou a youth! Herm. A curse upon this unseen power, I say, He curseth the constraint of a high destiny. That holds me. It takes likeness of a face, A woman's face, and stares into my own With awful deep reproach and wild amaze Among the myrtle bushes. It is gone. Ah! wherefore was I born more straitly mewed By some high fate and unknown destiny Than all men else by poverty or crime? I will be free. Come hence from this cursed place. 'Tis haunted. I will be thy knight, thy love,‚Äî But take me hence. [Exeunt Amanda and Hermadon. Enter Chauntval and Eulice. Chaun. The lily-asphodel The sensuous poet discourseth erotic talk unto Eulice. Breathes on the night: the jasmine clinging sighs About the white balusters like a bride All down this marble terrace. Sit thee down Under the balsam-tree. How the leaves shine Lacquered with moonlight! I will play to thee Upon the soft-stringed angelot. Eulice. Some tune Suiting the hour, most tender but not sad. Chaun. 'Twill quarrel with the moonlight and the moon For heartaches that they give as tunefully As the low bubbling of the nightingale There in the shadow of the orchard trees. The peaches and the bloomy nectarines Hang yearning for the sunlight on the wall, And I am full of craving for sweet joy Which ever flowers in music. Listen, love, And hear the flowering of the plant. Eulice. It swims Into mine ears with honeyed murmurings Like the air-beat of many gauzy wings. Chaun. It is our sweetest Proven√ße rhapsody; It will not mix with aught but perfumed air In gardens, by fair ladies in the night, Their frounced hair glittering gold through coils of pearls, Under the olives or the arbute trees, With kissings of the lute and archilute. Eulice. It tinkles as the Cities of the Plain With many broken lute-strings, heard afar Through the night air by the sad Patriarch Fearing for Lot. Chaun. Fair lady, though love died, Sweet passion lived in those doomed palaces, And made the cities vocal. Eulice. But the fire‚Äî The fire that came next day! Chaun. Think not of it. Take the bandore and strike across the strings; And as the tones of men and maidens mix, Talking in twilight, deeper tones with high, So shall our voices and our lute-strains wed. [They play in concert. Catch up the dying music on thy lip, And concentrate its essence in one kiss. Eulice. Nay, sir, the very night is full of eyes. Wait till the moon-rise. Then, when sleep hath sealed The heavy-lidded globes of all faint watchers Shall you ascend the ivy's lattice-work Upon a leafy ladder to my love, And we will drink of love's acanthice wine Until bright morning pearls the ivy-buds. But hark! a step. Chaun. Seek we some duskier shade. Eulice. This leads to the oak-coppice. Come with me. [Exeunt Chauntval and Eulice. Enter Clarimonde. Clar. Alone! 'tis better so. I am alone, Clarimonde stands ‚Äúaloof from other minds in impotence of fancied power.‚Äù And shall be ever till I find the queen. Yond stranger spake of her as of his dame, Nay, as of his dame's handmaid, one to win And cast aside. (Elzir approaches, hiding.) And I, who with high pain All round the verges of the dawn and dark, From brim to brim of oceans, over sands Biting the bare feet as with dust of fire, Or making my foot-armour melt my flesh, So hot it grew, have sought her day and night, Have seen no glimpse of her imagined face, And touched no whiteness of her hand. Elzir. (Aside.) Poor knight! Fairies no more than women may be won The Spirit of Beauty pitieth Clarimonde, and scorneth him. By bare long-suffering. Love is child of Fate, Loves not the loving but the lovable, And clothes the rich but rends the poor man's heart; And rich and poor are poor or rich by birth, As Nature fills the heart with dross or gold. Clar. But hither comes he. For one loved of gods, Like a base hawk that runs check from the hand, He lightly stoops to mortals. I will go. [Exit Clarimonde. Elzir. She folds him in her arms. She kisses him. She lures him on. As one star-struck he follows. Enter Hermadon and Amanda. Aman. I pray you listen to me. Sit awhile. Who is this queen that binds you? Herm. 'Tis no queen; For love to you, outsoaring with swift stroke The buzzard flight of that old sluggish love, Hath seized and borne me off. Nay, 'tis no queen That holds me from thee, but some haunting dream Of faith deep-plighted with my knightly vow. Aman. A dream is but a dream. The fragrant night Earthly Love seeks to persuade Hermadon that his belief in a higher destiny is a delusion. Breathes them upon our eyelids by the score, And often makes our sleep a Paradise. Let not these brooding seraphs, whose soft wings So fan our lids and brush our murmuring lips, Be turned to vampires and suck up our breath And leave us lifeless. Oh, forget it straight. Herm. But here, here in a chamber of my brain, In some aloof recess, it broods and pines, A bodement of strange ill, a memory Of vanished good. Aman. But still a dream. Herm. A curse! I would it might be blotted from my thoughts! I see her cold face looking into mine, The Queen of Beauty, to reassure him, discloseth herself for an instant. Full of immortal jealousy and love. Out there,‚Äîout yonder,‚Äîthere among the trees, Peering out from the laurels with green eyes, She draws me to her. Love, I cannot stay. She slays me like the basilisk. There! there! O queen! O goddess! take me from this world Out of this trial. Let me fly to thee. I come! I'll clasp thee, die, and be at peace. [Hermadon rushes to Elzir. She vanishes. Chorus of Spirits. Thou chief of the chosen, The hour is not yet; The life-stream is frozen, The ice-wall is set. It bars thee from heaven, It binds thee to earth, Till all be forgiven In darkness and dearth. The exile of spirits Live thou among men, Whose vision inherits The walls of their den; Who feel with blind fingers And grope in the gloom, Whose destiny lingers From the womb to the tomb. Scene II. ‚ÄîA Grove beyond the Gardens. Clar. I am sick at heart to see them dally so And feel my life so lonely. On this bank So violet-enamelled, under shade Of the great maple-trees, will I recline, Deep in the glumes of the rich flowering grass. The orchids hang in long festoons of flowers From tree to tree their twined anguineal coils; The coral-trees bristle with crimson spikes, And feathery aigrets top the tasseled reeds With tufts of scarlet yellowed by the moon; And flower-cups like soft alembics drenched With magic liquors send forth fumes of sleep. There is a poisonous stillness in the place: The upas and the shumac are at hand: The nightshade and the spindle-berry tree In purple blooms and carmine bunches vie To make death odorous and beautiful. Why should I ever seek this airling queen? Why totter ghostlike over stony ways, When here at hand is death's own morphia? My heart is all annealed to liquid love, Which there is none to cool. Shall it go waste? Shall all my days be vain? Nay, better die. What! die and leave the quest? Never, I swear! Perchance e'en now the queen is nigh at hand, The road draws near a close. But soft; who comes? There, 'mid the florulent bushet's under-wood, I saw some female shape‚ÄîEulice belike, Or fair Amanda. Will they follow here? And is there nowhere peace? Elzir. Fair stranger knight, The Queen of Beauty discloseth herself unto Clarimonde. I crave you of your courtesy what path Leads to the castle? Clar. This whereon you stand. Elzir. I am forwandered and forwearied, sir, With tracking up and down in the cold dews (Nay, look not on me as a basilisk That kills with touch of eyes), and I were fain Of rest and lodgment. Pray you lead the way Among the boles of these bewildering trees. What! are you feared? Here be no beryl eyes, No candent robe like surf of fire or snow, No glamour, no pale lady of the woods, But a poor wearied maid. Clar. I know not fear, Clarimonde knoweth her not. But for one moment my heart stayed for joy,‚Äî Now keeps her music steady. I had thought At first you were not earthly. Now I see The merest maiden half bestraught with fear And weariness. Elzir. And did you feel no dread, Deeming me nymph or goddess? Clar. Nay, but joy. I took you for some say, some glamoured dame, Perchance that queen to whom my days are sworn, Who sits beneath the nickar-tree and weaves In the Hid Isle. Elzir. The queen of the Hid Isle? Clar. The same. But ah! 'tis gone, my golden dream. Elzir. Here's one will be your lady for amends, For I have lost my knight. Clar. Beseech you, maid, Of courtesy forgive me. I am sworn To an immortal love. Elzir. Who aims too high O'ershoots the mark. Mortal to mortal hearts Are best beseen, and each thing to its kind. Will you not wear my colours and my glove Pinned to your brasset at all tourneyings, And fight for me? I am in mine own land A queen. Clar. Queen or no queen, it may not be. I am the pursuivant of heavenly Love, And may not taste of earthly. Elzir. Love on love The Queen of Beauty reproveth Clarimonde for his scorn of Love. Is built as tower on tower that would touch heaven. Love is a ladder for the angels' feet, A tree built up by storeys, growth on growth, And heavenly love a flower that tops the plant The root whereof drinks nutriment from earth, And is but earthy. Love is a torch-race, And each to each hands on the blazing brand, The sacred inextinguishable brand. Love merges into love by faint degrees: There are no gaps in Nature: first the high Melts into higher ere to highest caught: The love of earth before the love of heaven, The love of man before the love of gods. The lowest is self-love. From forth of self Man yearns to woman, woman yearns to man. Next, in the sphere and circle of our love We clasp all breathing things and beauteous, All forms of earth and sky. Next from that fruit We squeeze the essence, and love Beauty pure, Led to her by all lovely arts. She is The Hid Isle's queen, and such the path to her. Clar. Temptress and witch! I know thee who thou art, The stumbling-block of all pure-hearted knights, The unhallowed Venus. Elzir. Rest you well, fair sir! You crave to be a seraph and to know: I point the path of knowledge. You would lift The camis off the Queen of Beauty's limbs And look on Nature naked, not through gauze: I rend the veil for you. You would behold The Hid Isle's queen: I offer me your guide. You turn and spurn me. Clar. Nay, I know you not. How should I trust your truth? Elzir. Truth is a gem Locked in a casket; the key lies at hand. Some find the key at once and lift the lid. To others if you offer it, they gibe, And set off seeking over sea and land. The prosaic industry of prosaic persons, which ‚Äúis Vice.‚Äù ‚ÄúTell me not 'tis so easy.‚Äù So they sneer, And they are lost. Ye cannot change the heart. The statue is of one piece with the rock Whence it was hewn, granite or marble pure, Basalt, or crumbling tuff. Some you may smooth, Some never. Clar. You shall not mistrain my steps For all your evil bodements. I will keep The pure path and the clean. Elzir. So were you best. All miry ways lead to the supreme slough. I never sought to moil the purity Of your clean heart: but purity and love Never were foes save unto eyes impure. Clar. Peace, lady, and I pray you pardon me If like a churl I wrangled with a queen. But I bethought me of old tales which speak Of evil dames that haunt lake-lumined woods, With misty tresses and with lamping eyes That look out under rubied coronets, By white cascades and on smooth river-lawns Belled with the hoary spray of waterfalls, Or gleaming ghostlike through the duskier woods, Leaving a white track with their odorous robes, A snake-like, leprous, sleepy trail of fire Under the plashes of the flowery trees, Over the velvet mosses and the ferns. E'en such I deemed thee after thy plain speech Bespoke thee other than the queen I love, And when thy loftier utterance showed thee more Than mere forwandered maiden seeking rest, And therefore feared thee, and mistrustful fear Bred the rude haste of a discourteous tongue. Elzir. Have my free pardon: give me conduct hence: Or, since I may not be thy queen (and that I will ask never more), point thou the way, And I will go alone. Gainsay me not. I would not have you with me. Sir, obey. Clar. Then yonder is the ingate of the wood, Where through the embow√®d arches you see light. Beyond is a broad carse-land and a bridge, Then a long vista of white abel-trees, Which past, you will behold a sudden light That breaks in rainbows from the grain√®d glass Of agatine and shot prismatic panes, And hear the choiring anthem. Hard foreby Is the fair castle porch. Above the gate You will see two stone cupids with bent bows Entailed with branching scroll-work all about. There blow the horn. Now, lady, by your grace I will pass onward. [Exit Clarimonde. Elzir. Fare you well, kind sir. Oh, blindness baffling fickle jealousy! The sins of an artist against Art are better than the industry of a mediocrity. I would not change my faithless for this faith, My recreant for this slave. Year after year He seeks me. Lo, I give myself to him: He flies as from a devil; knows me not, Talks with me deeming me some common stray, Mere maiden and mere mortal, or at best An evil wraith, a goblin of the wood. I will lure back my hawk and gyve him fast With golden jesses, let this kestrel be. Scene III. ‚ÄîAmanda's Bower. Enter Amanda leading Hermadon. Aman. Here sit and rest. Forget that evil dream, Hermadon is sore tempted and disarmed by Earthly Love. And tell me of thy doughty deeds of arms. I'll bring thee water in a golden ewer Mixed with the rose-bud's thrice-distill√®d juice, And in a silver basin lave thy hands. Bid me ungird thy glaive; uncase thy breast Of all this rigid gold. About thy neck I'll hang a chain of pearls, and clothe thy limbs In a brave silken camis, and thine head With samite chaperon. These rustling weeds Shall better fit than baldric and cuirass, Gorget and burganet of burnished gold, For Love's dear warfare. Set thy warrior feet In these fair slippers, sewn with small seedpearls And stitched with finest twire of silken floss: Unbind those jarring cuishes: put aside Thy breastplate: sit down in thine hacqueton: Undo this jewelled belt, and let it go After the cruel sword, its bosom friend; It is too heavy. Arm thee with the lute, And lift its delicate strings to strains of love. Herm. O lady! I was noursled in mine arms, And cannot breathe in silk. Aman. I have heard say That warriors practise fight with weightier blades, And handsel first the lighter in the fray; So then, being bred in steel, you cannot swoon Under this gauzy cassock. Herm. Nay, I know not. My limbs feel molt, as it were venomous flame And clung to them, eating away the flesh. Aman. Here is but cloth and sleeves purfled with gold, No fire. Herm. Ay, fire that thrids my marrow through With piercing pangs of love. Aman. Repeat that word. It falls more sweetly from thy lips than dew Out of the rose's heart. Herm. It is indeed A heart-drop of distill√®d agony, Squeezed out by sorrow. Aman. Nay, be merry, love. Herm. Merry I might be, but for some vague sense, Some haunting dream. Ah, God! across my eyes It lies like bars of iron, weights of lead, Telling me I was born for higher things. Aman. Thus let me wipe it off with one sweet kiss. Herm. I felt your lips like the cold kiss of Death, Or as his bony finger on my brow, Death of my higher soaring spirit of life, That leaves this sepulchre for evermore. Song of Spirits without. For evermore, for evermore, Carillon lily-bells ring out, And all above and all about Thin astral echoes sink and soar For evermore! For evermore, for evermore, Forever safe whate'er betide, Who once hath kist the heavenly bride, Though keenly pierced and baffled sore, For evermore! For evermore, for evermore, Unmarred by fretting wasp or bee, The canker and the blight, shall be The perfume in the rose's core For evermore! Aman. How sweet the night-wind playing on the leaves A harp-like melody! How sweet a scent Comes in with it of fainting marjoram And balsamed calamint! Herm. Heard you no voice? Aman. 'Tis but the wind, the chantress of the night, That makes wild lute-strings of the ivy-stems, And pours all round the turret her high voice, Mixed with the groanful music of the pines And chiming bells among the silver stars Uprisen from the cloister. Herm. And no voice? No tuneful warning voice, sublimely glad Yet gently chiding? Hark! they sing again. Chorus of Spirits without. Be faithful to thy destiny, And learn in bondage to be free. The stars above in bonds of love Are to the sun chained‚Äîthou to me. Be faithful to thy destiny, And learn in bondage to be free. The fickle sea, the shifting sea, Obeys the moon. Obey thou me. Aman. You seem not well. Here is a beaker drenched With frory wine cold as the crystal beads That drop from rocks on mountain-pinnacles, But with a sense of fire under the snow. See how the concave of the golden cup Reddens across the rose-blush of the wine A carmine redder than carbuncle stones. Drink it all down and live again. Herm. Nay, love; The fit is past. It launched me through the side, That voice, e'en like a dagger. I am well. Aman. Then kiss me and forget. Herm. I will forget. I swear it. Kiss me. Spirits. Kisses thrown in air Wear sweet love away Little by little, Till it grow despair, Losing day by day Some jot or tittle; For though lovers swear, Lasting loves are rare; Loving faiths decay, Loving oaths grow brittle, Fading year by year, Broken day by day, Little by little. Herm. Nay, thou wilt alter; hers is deathless love. Love passeth; Art abideth. Here I am but a pilgrim and a shadow, Flitting phantasmal through a shifting dream, Groping among delusions. There I live, A real being, in communion high With her, and, brooded by her outstretched wings, Made one with her forever. Let me go. Give me mine arms. Aman. Nay, gentle prisoner! Look where they stood! You are my captive knight. But I will keep thee as some tender maid Prisons a starling in a wicker cage, To let it peck upon her rosy nails And bite her cherry lips with angry love, With spiteful tenderness. Nay, frown not so. Your heart is glamoured: you are all mine own: Hermadon bewitched and enslaved. You have drunk magic wine, a love-philtre, More potent never brewed in crucible By witch from herbs enchanted at full moon. You are my slave. Herm. It flashes in on me. I know all now. Save me, my Queen Elzir. Chorus of Spirits without. Forever safe, whate'er betide, Who once hath kist the heavenly bride.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. ‚ÄîA Beautiful Grove. Eulice. Here, in the grove under the citron-trees, The loves of Eulice and Chauntval. He bade me tarry. How quick my heart beats! Is it with haste o'erpast or love to come? I will disrobe me of this heavy cloak, And loose the cincture of my breathless waist, And sit down in the moss. He hath well chosen. 'Tis a fit place for love. The dormant air Swoons with its weight of perfume; the green heaven Of leaves glitters with constellated flowers, And all the grass engrailed with cyclamens And clustering glomes of wondrous scarlet blooms. No noyous insects flit in the strange air; Only the burnished plumes of humming-birds, And rainbow-painted sails of royal moths, And steel-blue adderflies with needle shape And filmy changes of prismatic wings, And many a wondrous green habiliment, That, like a breastplate of enamelled metal, Sheathes up the drumbling beetle for the wars. Yonder the red scales of the topaz-bird, The overlapping plates of plumy mail, Nestling among the florulent parasites, Flame like the clear-cut edges of a gem, Or mark his flying path with rubious flames Through the wood's twilight green. How silver-clear The meagre brooklet drops her chinking coins Driblet by driblet on to the smooth rock, Then wanders in a streak of silver green, Chamfering through the glade her narrow way! And how the birds sing! Chaun. What! before me, love? Eulice. The fonder feet are ever first at tryst And the more eager lips. Chaun. The fairer one Should be less eager, and the beautiful Than the soul seeking beauty. Therefore, love, You have usurped my right. Eulice. I have usurped The place of worshipper, which should be mine, And left to thee the niche that holds the god, Which had I filled, I had usurped indeed, Who now am no usurper. Chaun. Yet change parts; Be you the saint, and I will kiss your feet. Eulice. You would waste kisses if you kissed my feet That cannot taste them. Give them to my lips. Chaun. Then thus I greet their coralline delights In melting joy. No red anemone, No sea-flower of the ocean branching out Under the burning Ethiopian sea On shelving twilight rock, is ruddier. What say you to the place? Have I done well? Eulice. You have chosen, as a poet, a sweet spot, A fairer garden than the Hesperides'. Chaun. Feel what a couch of deep elastic moss For comfort, and what colour for delight. Have you a name for it? A wine-red hue Deepening to russet brown, the brown to bronze And fierce ferruginous hues of rich red rust. Here will we lie and twitter in a nest Of downier lining than the robin builds, And when we are aweary of sweet play, I'll bring you flowers and fruit. The orange boughs And flush cornelian trees shall furnish us With wild-wood dainties, Nature's confiture; And the clear brook shall cool our fevered lips With the pure wine the dipping fern-leaves drink. And I have brought the lute. Eulice. Oh, sit by me And pick up from the strings that tune once more Which in the lamp-lit gardens first you played Upon that night of franchised revelry, And won my heart. Chaun. Then you must rest on me With all your shoulder and your white arm's weight, And make electric flashes in my brain; Else cannot I play it so as then I did. Eulice. Will that serve? Chaun. Ay! Thy bare arm on my neck Enchafes the very fountains of my life, Which bubble to my lips in music. Hark! Meet me where the river rushes through the valleys: Meet me where the lotus leaves lie on the mere: Meet me where the moonbeams slant adown green alleys: Meet me where the forest leaves lie brown and sere: Meet me in the twilight by the weir: Meet me in my dreams, Where I see the winds and hear The moonbeams! Thou art lovelier than all shapes, or sounds, or visions, Night-appearing phantoms, or conceived by day; Sweeter than all fabled Edens and Elysians: Heaven's angels, dreamland's houris fade away And the Islands of the Blest decay With their burning flowers: Loves of angels pass away, But not ours. Eulice. That tune enfires the very air with love, And drowns the brook, and silences the birds, And makes the air pant quick. Sing it again, But drop the lute and twist about my neck Thy liberated arm,‚Äîfor I would dream,‚Äî And sing it in mine ear. Enter Amanda. Aman. What have we now? My dame Eulice and Chauntval! Eulice. Pardon, lady. Aman. Eulice, I little deemed thee light of mood, Earthly Love reproveth Light Passion. Whom I have kept to be about my bed And share my board. And you, Sir Troubadour, Who were my guest, have recompensed me well, Making my virgin friend thy belamour. Yet thou shalt make amends, and thou, Eulice, Shalt have thy love. Chaun. I pray you, gentle queen, Bid me go fight against the Saracens Or seek the ph≈ìnix in Egyptian land, Or where the Ethiop feels the scorching sun Go groping for the fountains of the Nile, But bid me not put bondage on my love, Or even flowery fetters on my limbs, For I was born for freedom. Eulice. He speaks well. Chauntval, I am not wroth with thee for this, As many a maid of milder mould had been. I am thy counterfeit, even such as thou, Or we had never loved each other so! I was not fashioned for a faithful wife: I would not wed and hate thee. Chaun. Sweet Eulice! Gracious, you hear her. Aman. Go, you light-o'-loves! You quick, hot sparrows, sickly cooing doves, That peck and flutter for a moment's sport. You, lady, I will pardon for this once, But, for I am not rich in pardons, know Thou hast my whole store of them, having this. You, Chauntval, ere the sun thrice set and rise I bid begone, or dearly it aby, From all the circle of my fair domains, And ne'er again be seen about my court. Chaun. Fair queen, I bow to thy most righteous doom, And thank thee in behalf of this dear dame, Who stands so shamefast, for thy grace to her. Farewell, Eulice. 'Tis hard to part so soon, Before the cloying of the sweet. Eulice. Three days Our lady gives thee. Bide with us for two, And, gentle queen, I pray you join my prayer With thy command. Aman. Well, be it as you will; But breed no further scandal to our court. Come, lovers, we will banquet you to-night, And once again; but after you must part. Scene II. ‚ÄîThe Exterior of the Necromancer's Grotto. Clar. They said he dwelt hereby, under the bent Clarimonde goeth unto the University, and converseth with a certain Professor. Of this same hill, in a deep-tunneled grot Crusted with sparry branching minerals, Lit up by facets of effulgent gems And roofed with dropping crystals, all the mouth Choked up with clambering flowers of parasites, And matted elf-locks of entangled leaves Covering a woody trellise of tough stems. Hard by the cavern grew a wilding fig-tree, Weaving broad shade to tempt the thirsty fawn Over the vitrine marges of a pool. Here be the pool and fig-tree, there the flowers Vaunting their clusters on the embloom√®d cliffs, Clothing the bare scarped rock with royal robes, But nowhere through the enshielding tanglement Appear the mouth and ingate of the grot. But hark! I hear strange music in the hill. Following the sound with ear hard by the wall, I'll find perchance the chink it issues from. Enter the Necromancer. Necro. You seek my dwelling? Clar. Hermes of the rock? Necro. So I am called. Clar. I come to question thee. I am sore plagued with many dreams and doubts, That swarm in me awake, and when I sleep Droning with dismal voices. But the sting Of these dread hornets might be venomless, And leave no barb√®d splinters in my heart, But for one high-pitched siren-song of hope Of one that sits upon a moonlit rock Far in the ocean, swathed with golden hair, Enringed with whirling eddies of green light, Singing over the sunken coral reefs, Her sweet song marvelled at by the blue foam,‚Äî One dream of happiness scarce to be won, And yearned upon with everlasting pain. Necro. I know the voice. I too in youthful dreams Have heard her singing down the golden trail Of the swift-shifting moonbeams on the sea. Clar. I pray you tell me what her singing means. Necro. Young knight, I said I heard her song in youth, The Professor confesseth that in his youth he wrote verses. But I am old now. When it struck mine ears, It filled all blood in me with sudden fire, And through my veins the liquid current ran, And I became as light as lark in cloud, Dancing with soft vibrations of the heart, Like bubbling water or like frothing wine. And then I said I will not drench my lids With dews of night, or ope to rays of morn In drowsy peace or waking, till I learn By art or magic what her singing means. But the far-off evangel of my youth, Hath never sounded nearer. I have strained Spirit and sense to part the confluent notes, And make the vague wild voice articulate; But more I make division of the notes, If you dissect Beauty or Joy, they vanish. The more their sweetness fades and vanishes: And I am left an old man in the wild, Alone with the dim sweetness of a dream, A vanished dream. Clar. What, then, is magic vain? Are Metaphysics vain? May a man sell his soul and have no profit? And canst thou not, under Avernian glades, By mystic incantation o'er the fumes Of chafing-dishes charged with glamoured herbs, Call up thin spectres and lewd Lami√¶ From Acheron, that with their bloodless lips Shall utter thee the secrets of the dead? Necro. Ay, from the trackless regions, from the slime Of Stygian lakes and the red glare of Hell I can raise phantoms. Clar. Then thou knowest all. Necro. Nay, for these know not. E'en the prince of them, That dwells apart in the profoundest zone, Abaddon, the destroyer, knows not this. Clar. Methought the demons had a seraph's mind With a fiend's heart. Necro. The poison at the core A bad moral nature corrupts intellectual clearness. Affects the rind and all the pulp between. Charred ashes and red putrid powder fill The Sodom-fruit and grate upon the teeth. So hath their evil spirit threaded them, And turned their wisdom's fruit to rotten dust, And whoso eats of it shall writhe his mouth. Clar. Then these know not the path to the Hid Isle? Hermes. I said not so. Some know that secret well Ethics and Art distinct. Despite the canker of their crime; but these Owe not to crime the secret; nor shall one But you cannot become a poet by ‚Äúsmelling of wine in the morning,‚Äù nor a philosopher by doubting all moral truths. By aping of their sin go up to heaven. Clar. Nay, but can these not tell us? Necro. If they would, They could not; for the path to the Hid Isle Hath, among other barriers and delays, No man can make another a poet or a philosopher; Art and Philosophy are incommunicable secrets. This chiefly‚Äînone that ever came thereat Could point the way to his heart's dearest friend. Clar. I am one groping in a twilight wood, And grow more wildered farther that I stray. I wander with no clue, and come again To the old place. I question whom I meet. Some know not; others, knowing, tell me nought. Is there no outlet? Necro. Good youth, look on me. Are not my hairs white and my forehead trenched? A lifetime have I circled in this wood, O'er silken moss, through cruel hook√®d briars That tear the flesh, and in rank undergrowths Where, with forked flickering tongue and sibilant lips, The horned cerastes slides along the grass And bites the passing feet, that straight swell up, Turn blue with lurid dropsy, and are dead. And still I saw above me the green boughs Lamping with globy fruit and clustering flowers, And found the sylvan tropic had no end No outlet to the wood of philosophic speculation. That my feet should attain to. Nay, at times It grew a withered garden of dead trees Planted in shaly sand or burnt-out marl, And came the flowers at longer intervals. And now they are all withered, and I stand As in a fossil forest of the prime, The dry wood of Metaphysics. Long petrified under the icy sea, And feel my heart grow stone in sympathy With the dead universe I live in. Friend, Such is my life,‚Äîsuch has been, such shall be. And dost thou murmur, who art young, and crave With frantic cry an outlet? I have none: And thou art answered. Clar. Nay, I pity thee. I cannot claim thy pity, which is dead, Or should be after so great suffering. But that my life lack not the meagre joys That helped thee bear thine thus far, I would learn To talk with spirits. Necro. Oh, forbear it, friend! The Professor cautioneth Clarimonde against Metaphysics. I deem, at times, 'twas this that slew the flowers, And blasted all the fruit, and dried the grass; And I might yet be wandering in the wood Where my youth wandered, finding still no end, But treading on the glumes of glossy grass, And mossy plush, and silken floss, and flowers, Under the red spikes of the coral trees, My nostrils drunk with aromatic fumes From the magnolias and the balsam-fruit. Clar. Ay, and the serpents gnawing on thine heels! But be my master, for I love not flowers, And I have never trod in the soft grass, Nor smelt the woodland odours. From the first My wood hath been the fossil wood you tell of, Stern rock and shingle. Therefore never fear To kill the flowers. Necro. Then come to me by night, Clarimonde matriculates. And to thine eager ears by spirit-mouths I will unfold the mystic wanderings Of those who most have groped among the trees Wherein we dwell, and dreamed they found the isle, And could to other men declare the path, Which, whensoever other men have tried, They have been lost in endless wanderings, And found the treacherous teachings of the wise A meteor or a fen-fire, and the isle Their masters found and took for the true goal But as the visioned palms that hang in air And mock the traveller on the burning sands, Who seeks for some green isle of water-wells Where he may drink and sleep in shade or die. Clar. Yet will I prove this for myself, and learn All that thou hast to teach. At midnight hour Will I come hither. Necro. I will welcome thee. The Professor compassionateth Clarimonde, for that he is young and yet a confirmed prig. Poor foot-sore wretch! my life's Gehenna past Hath been, I fear, to thine a Paradise. Scene III. ‚ÄîInterior of Necromancer's Cavern. Globes, Telescopes, Instruments everywhere. In the middle a Tripod and a Ring of Dead Bones and Skulls. Necro. Within this sacred halo of dry bones The Professor prepareth a lecture. And old worm-fretted skulls of men long dead, Let none plant footing save whose middle wears The cincture, and whose back the ermined cape Of great societies of old magicians, Or him by some so plumed initiated! The glamourous ingredients of the spell Give off a fume upon the candent plate, Potsherds, and crazy crocks, and halms of straw, And husks of grain thrice threshed away to nothing At Athens, Rome, and Alexandria, Or by stout threshers on the banks of Rhine; Some remnants of old bricks, that once had part And portion in a stately edifice, Raked up by me from dunghills, so divorced From their true station and significance At cope or groundsill, or to prop a frieze Borne high aloft on Caryatid's brows, And worshipped out of all proportion; sticks, Old acorn-cups, and pale caducous leaves Or fever-florid, grubbed up at the roots Of none but dead or black fire-blasted trees.‚Äî Alas! at dawn some few days past I met (It seemed as 'twere myself in the old days) The Professor detecteth a young man in the very act of composing verses. A young magician gathering herbs. His face, Over whose white the red of youth distreamed Brighter than achiote, was shadowed by Light floating flakes of wild coruscant hair; And in his arms he bore a fragrant heap, Sleepful cup-roses and grape-hyacinths, Bed-straw and lady-smocks, and gemmy buds Of myrtles, cereous waterlilies, shocks And loose luxuriant twines of caprifole, And heavy globe-flowers of the amaranth, Flamy gold celandines from fenny flats, And sheaves of yellow flaglike flower-de-luce Glomes of white guelder roses, clustering balls Of cowslips, bunches of bright daffodils, Whole nodding swaths of the corn-marigold, Red tiger-lilies, purple passion-flowers, And rigid swordy sheaths of gladioles: Nor had the youth forgot to mix therewith Poisonous weeds culled on damp everglades, Or swampy isles 'twixt bends of diffluent streams, The enwomb√®d venom of lurid nightshade blooms Buried in knotty glumes of adder's grass. These he bore off and in a brazier burned. Whereat uprose a sleepy fume of sweets: The Professor reproveth him. But I drew nigh and plucked him by the gown, And said, You make heaven sick with Pagan rites. Behold these bricks wet from baptismal fonts, Or from the apsis of old Christian churches‚Äî (Knocking.) It is the knight Sir Clarimonde. Thrice welcome! Clarimonde goeth up unto the University and readeth Humane Letters. Clar. How foul a stench comes from the stinkpot there! Are these your rites? Necro. Ay, sit you down awhile, And I will call the dead to talk with you. Alectryomancy, geomancy too, The Professor is ‚Äúnothing if not critical.‚Äù To him criticism is superior to the creation of a system. And ceromancy, and all other forms Of divination, are but void and null, Save only glorious necromancy! See At my hand's wavure how the spectres rise! The Professor raiseth the ghost of Plato. 1st Spectre. I dwelt at Athens.‚ÄîThings you seem to see Are shadows cast by true existences, Ideas and archetypes, as images By sunlight or by starlight seen in water Are but vague pictures of true beasts and trees; And all ideas stream from the sun of Good. Ye are but captives in a spectral cave Gazeful on shadows, till to lead you forth Gold-footed comes Eros‚Äî Necro. Leave out Eros. He is dangerous and we are sick of him. [1st Spectre vanishes. Necro. He is insulted. Never mind! There's more. 2nd Spectre. Ideas are foolery. Start from principles. Of Aristotle. The pure intuitive mind will give them you Upon experience (see my Topica). Necro. Ay, but we wish some goal of life. 2nd Spectre. The goal Is happiness, and happiness abides In the brain-whirl of true philosophy. Necro. You hear, my son? Clar. So this is then the queen. The queen of the Hid Isle is but a headache! [2nd Spectre vanishes. 3rd Spectre. I come from Alexandria.‚ÄîThe soul Of Plotinus. Is pure before its birth, but, floating down From the region of fixed stars, contracts a taint At birth, whereof to rid it is the end And aim of life. And this can but be done By purging spirit of the alloy of matter, Killing the flesh and lifting up the soul In lofty speculation. I at last Blushed that I had a body. Clar. 'Tis the same: Only the other called it happiness. [3rd Spectre vanishes. Necro. You scared him with that word, for happiness He counts the only sin. But see the next: He wears the madman's lean and haggard face. 4th Spectre. Atoms and void: these make the world and man, Of Lucretius. The carolling birds, the fishes of the sea, The soul, and tranquil orders of the gods; Wherefore have peace: the soul is but a fume Of finer, smoother globules than the rest, Which being scattered, memory's link is snapt, And sufferings on death's other side not ours. Divinest Epicurus taught me this. 5th Spectre. I spin out truths from the cocoons of texts. Of a Scholastic Philosopher. I am a silkworm and no spider, I! 6th Spectre. We will have no ideas. Let us have forms, Of Bacon. Which when we know, we may turn stones to gold. ‚ÄúThe end of knowledge is to enrich life With new inventions.‚Äù Clar. Then the queen is mine If I contrive a novel sort of jakes! 7th Spectre. I think; therefore I am. And God is true; Of Descartes. Therefore the world is as I see it‚Äî Clar. Yes, But you yourself a spectre. Necro. He is gone. 8th Spectre. God is the one sole substance. All the world Of Spinoza. Is but God's raiment. Pious thoughts not true Are food for man, and to be pious means To live in charity with all men. Clar. Thanks! That is the best as yet. Necro. His life be witness. 9th Spectre. All truth lies in experience. Self and God Of Locke. Are built thereon. No truth is born in us. 10th Spectre. My spirit makes my world. The world is but Of Berkeley. A dream to which I give the colours. 11th Spectre. Truth! Of Hume. There is no truth. Thy soul is but a dream. 12th Spectre. There is truth. 'Tis but when we stray too far Of Kant. We come to cross-roads. What things are themselves We cannot know. Into the moulds of Sense And Understanding pour Experience, And lo, 'tis truth; but soar above thy pitch, God and the soul in the thin air of Reason Give double aspects to thee. Yet have faith! Thought fails, but duty proves there is a God. 13th Spectre. Stay there! Each step to God with the pure mind, Of Hegel. Through the enlarging spheres of all the heavens, Up the steep Jacob's ladder, is made fast, So thou hast strength to climb, and wilt confess That being and not being are the same In all things saving but the Soul and God, Of whom they have no meaning. Follow me! 14th Spectre. The sciences are one great pyramid; Of Comte. The top is truth. If you must have a God, Worship Humanity. 15th Spectre. Humanity! Of Mill. Mere jargon. Love the good of other men. 16th Spectre. But suffer me to say our own good first. Of H. Spencer. Clar. O God! let me begone out of this place! He hath enough of Humane Letters, and goeth forth right gladly. [Rushes out, leaving the Necromancer.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. ‚ÄîA Dungeon under Amanda's Castle. Hermadon in chains. Herm. Forsaken both of Love and that strong sense Earthly Love bringeth Hermadon to the prison of ‚Äúcircumstance, that inessential god.‚Äù He loses freedom and becomes a subject for fate, as Hegel would say. Of antenatal glory and a home In worlds than this beyond compare more sweet, Which till this hour has borne me up through all, I am a prisoner, armless, helpless, lost: A prisoner to my truth, which if I sold I might be free and loved,‚Äîloved of a queen. Chorus of Spirits without. There is no greater queen Than she who saves thee; Who sees, herself unseen, What death engraves thee; Who breaks the dismal scene And unenslaves thee. Herm. True, I am prisoned, but my soul is free. He consoleth himself with visions. I gaze upon the walls, the walls recede; They break, they split, they crumble to mine eyes, Tapped by the wizard rod of gramarye, And through the gap I see fair moonlit fields Cloaked to my sight with haze of loving tears (I know not if it be the rising dews That make this vapour or my weeping eyes That brim to look on beauty's nakedness), Mountains and seas and streams and sleepful lakes Swathed in a grapy purple atmosphere The pale enubilous hues of autumn night, The early twilight blossoming with stars. I feel wings growing; out at the grated window My soul flies forth, moving her winnowing vans Over the peaks, and skimming the sea-foam With gossamery touch that feels no damp. I fly forth out of my great solitude: I visit cities! All their gable-spikes, And spiry pointels, and blue spheric domes (Bubbles the hue of livid cyanite), Gleam under me like the broad stellular heavens, With here a lunet, there a candent sun That palpitates and breathes with white-hot fire, All clustered round one loadstar goldenly, One cynosure of all the circling heavens, A temple of white marble globy-roofed Like the clear upturned mirror of a shield, With a great glassy convex of leaved gold Poised on slim moon-white shafts of fluted stone, A bright basilica. As in a hive The bees, so in its hollow music booms. The people pour into and out of it; And all around the lithe anguineal curves Of sinuous streets and lamp-lit garden-walks Glitter and coruscate with astral lights. I see, too, obelisks of strange blue stone That point like needled splints of malachite; And at their base young wanton lovers meet. Their whispering reaches me: and I hear the strings Of gitterns at the windows and in the streets, And one high tenor voice from one white square, From a lone figure whose cloaked shadow falls Upon the moon-blanched pavings: passionate, sweet, It pierces heaven with frantic pleas of love. There is a river too runs through the town; And by one marble flight of palace-stairs, At a dark angle, sweeps a lady's robe (I hear the white silk rustling through the hum Of all the city voices). A boat waits; She enters it. I hear them kissing. See, They have forgot to fly in ecstasy Of meeting. The light skiff is still fast bound To the white wharf. With stealthy tiger-pace One follows down the steps. A blue sword gleams. A dark blot like an ink-pool on the slabs! A grume of blood that trickles down the steps! All in phantasmal dumb-show. Then a scream. I turn away. A deep fervescent glow Calls off my gaze. The people flock to it. It is the theatre. The flambeaus flare: The fanfare sounds: the rising tiers are filled. The roof is open. I can see the stage All in a glow of light, a gate of heaven, An opened Paradise. The swaying lamps Flicker between the rows of thronging heads. Sudden in loud orchestral symphony Electric storm of many violins Thrills up, and makes my blood dance in mid-air. It ceases. Then the rattle of many hands. Then all are silent. What is't draws their tears? Is it the woes of sweet Antigone, And with ‚Äúsitting a joyous applauder‚Äù in an imaginary theatre. Self-doomed Alcestis, or Polyxena, Or bleeds a maid at Aulis, or, thence borne, Now priestess of the inhuman Tauric fane, Flies with her brother and stolen Artemis? Or sits a blind and exiled wanderer At white Colonus in the sacred grove, Thence by a whirlwind borne away to heaven? Or moans the sufferer of the dismal isle? Or rather in the silver-sided bath Does Agamemnon, caught in purple net, Groan thrice? Or bear they offerings to his tomb, Drink-offerings, while the avenger is at hand? Or speaks Prometheus hanging from his rock To horn√®d Io and the ocean nymphs?‚Äî Then the night deepens. Light by light goes out, Till all the city galaxy is dark, Save here and there some tremulous taper throws A swordy beam of white light o'er the street From upper windows, where I guess what loves Amid what snowy draperies exult. All round a foamy mist breaks up and swathes, All evanescent shapes and tree-tops blurred, Orchard, and garth, and garden, in white brume, Where fen-fires play and meteors flash and fade, And goblins, gnomes, and ghouls hold revelry, Or sometimes fly into the town, and there, In the deep shadow and shine on moonlit roofs, Peep at each other round the chimney-stacks, Or stare in at the grates of prisons. Woe! The spell is broken. I am here again, All the entrancement vanished; here embarred, Mewed up, and pent in prison. That one word Turned me to stone with a Gorgonian stare. Chorus of Spirits without. A dream, a dream is broken, And with dreams, wherein he hath this special faculty, that his dreams, night after night, are consecutive, and form a distinct spiritual life. But the dreaming soul lives on. It shall hear the words then spoken, It shall see the stars that shone: The dream-words and the dream-stars bright That lit that magic-garden Shall come again some dim sweet night And our oblivion pardon. The dream-caresses on our brow Shall be the same they were but now, And we shall see those other friends That never tire or harden,‚Äî Our dream-friends we forget awake, Who wait us in that other world, Re-recognised and loved, and make The day worth living for the sake Of the inner dream it carries furled, At sleep-fall of the night uncurled, For those who live 'twixt break and break, Half here, half in the spirit-world. Herm. True, holy voice, I shall regain my dream; But meanwhile I am dead and desolate. Enter Amanda. Aman. Nay, for I would be with thee if thou wouldst. Herm. Most cruel! is it thou? Nay, free me soon, Or I must die. Aman. Pledge but thy troth of love, And from the enwombing darkness of this cave I will release thee into healthsome air. Herm. It cannot be. Aman. Then I, who might command He is released to fight against the Philistine. Or slay, now as a suppliant sue to thee. My land is threatened with a swarm of foes That round its ring√®d ramparts roar in arms, Its sea-walls garreted with bristling towers, Land-threatened, and from sea by arm√®d ships, Whose bulwarks glitter hung with thousand shields Of warriors sworn against my land and me, Of him who vaunts a griffon on his targe, His helmet gauded with a crimson plume, Brother of Balder, whom you slew. He cries For your blood and for mine. Wherefore be free, Go forth, and fight and conquer. Herm. Happy chance The hour that sent this man against thy land! I will go forth. But, queen, I cannot fight Save in my magic arms. Aman. They are at hand; My pages carry them. A cunning smith Awaits thee to encase against this fray. Herm. Then I am free. Most gladly, gracious one, Will I engird myself in thy behalf, And come back like a conqueror, never fear, Having first driven these rebels from thy realms. Scene II. ‚ÄîThe Army of Amanda assembled before her Castle. Aman. Here, in the face of all my warriors, Hermadon armed by Amanda for the fight against the Philistines. I will equip thee. Page, give me the sword. My champion, take thou back at penitent hands, And with this falchion break their scimitars. Herm. I thank thee, queen, and shall not spare to smite. Aman. And see I set thine helmet on thy head. Look visored thus upon their turbaned swarms! Eulice. Shows he not grand, shadowed with falling flakes And vacillant feather-fronds of ostrich plume Dyed blood-red, rioting o'er the globy gold Like flame-tongues lambent round a molten sun? Chaun. By heaven, I will go with thee, though I smite Chaunt val goeth forth likewise. But with my lute upon their Paynim pates, Since go I must from hence. Herm. Ay, come with me: Thou art my brother. Join we common cause All true poets forget their private feuds in presence of the Philistines, the common enemy. Against this horde, this wild unruly folk Of peasant slaves, that from the burning East Threaten descent to swamp these smiling fields Of love and beauty, and make all our world One howling waste of hideousness‚Äîthe dark And deadly people of the Philistines. Clar. I will not go, for in my secret heart Clarimonde refuseth to go. I love this people, and I mind me still Of my old bruises in that former fray, His reasons. Got in defence of thee; at thought whereof, Woe! how my sword-arm aches under the mail! I will be neutral. Therefore, gracious queen, Count me excused. Herm. Good sir, we need you not. Bring in Gelwedrun. (Page leads in Gelwedrun.) Ah, mine Erebus, The steed of satiric wrath. My black Abaddon, my destroying angel! Bear me on wings of darkness to this fray. Aman. Farewell! go forth and conquer. Eulice. Fare you well, Eulice parteth with Chauntval. Sweet Chauntval! one more kiss. See! take this scarf, And for a gorget wrap it round thy neck; For though I care not greatly if thou slay Or thou be slain, since thou art banished hence, Yet have I loved thee for thy beauty's sake As dear as e'er I loved a man, as deep As I have love for anything. Farewell! Chaun. Farewell! Such love as ours breaks easily Without one heartache. Yet your kiss and favour Shall dance before my eyes amid the swords. Farewell! Clar. I will go make a pilgrimage Unto the Holy Sepulchre. Chaun. Oh, be off!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. ‚ÄîThe Gardens of Amanda's Castle. Elzir. The blood of Spring, ebullient with flowers The time being full, the Queen of Beauty returneth for her Knight. Of foamy snow, that sprinkle the black thorn Here in the regions of weak mortal men, Where Summer reigns but half the ice-locked year, Bells every bough with knobs of gummy green, And beryl buttons, and small pearly studs, Sheathed buds, and glittering bosses of pale gold, And soft red globules bursting into flowers. I long to see the first, now rolled up tight, Unfold itself into a petalled star, A lipped corolla, or flamy nucleus fringed With iris-coloured rays, unravelling The golden tissues from their mystic knot Like a round globe of jelly on a rock That opes into a sprouting coral flower And reaches out its arms into the blue. There be creative kisses in the air That quicken, where they light, both the green blade And men, reviving after bitter days, And gladsome beasts. The crystal spars of frost, That crusted the green earth with fretwork fine Of hoary silver and grey filigree, And shiny cobwebs of fine crossing thread That crumbled to sharp powder at the touch, Biting the finger like brayed splints of glass, Are fled in fumes of evanescent breath Along the ebbing path of the bleak wind, Following to the place of dreams forgot Winter's white fading footprints on the hills. The day comes round to claim again my love, To strike the blinding film from his clear eyes And breathe away the mist. Now is he mocked With cloudy colours that keep out the day, The clear blue day, with gorgeous-painted plumes Flying from east to west, bright-coated heralds That fools deem fairer than the approaching king, Elusive transient vapours of earth's love. I must draw dack the fringes of the clouds And let in the clear colourless white sun. But soft! he comes, and with him his false love, Happy and pitiable above all sorrow. She purposes to wed with him to-day, Ere which befall I will pass lightly hence And fetch the wing√®d barque of his return. Now must I bury me in the May-blossom And watch these pairing birds. Aman. Nay, not a day. When shall we have a fairer though we wait For the full roses? I have strewn the bed With golden broideries, and made the feast, And called artificers from many lands To build a palace with a roof of gold, To carve us screens of ivory, and stud The inner walls with scrolls of jewel-flowers. You shall be monarch over all my lands And hold the lives of myriads. Thronging slaves Shall serve in peace and follow you in war, And fan fair dreams into your sleeping eyes, Shred perfumes, and distil into your ears Love-liquid music: all the paths of bliss, The winding sensuous ingates to the heart, Shall be as channeled courses for full floods Of tidal joy, that flow and never ebb, Filling thy life with moonlight reveries And the soft tumult of the waves of love. Herm. Well, be it so. My love, that could not learn Hermadon breaketh his vow to the Queen of Beauty. To be your slave, may be your emperor. You make me monarch, sitting in your throne Of the red orient; for from this land Hermadon meditateth the conquest of all Philistia. Leading battalions of electric steel, I will go forth and conquer all the world! Aman. Nay, you shall love me first. Herm. A year or twain I will stay with you, nurturing my soul And growing golden plumage for my flight. Aman. Yea, my right royal eagle, in the rings Where the bright coruscation of thine eyes, Eclipsed and reappearing like two stars, Makes interchange of darkness and of light, I'll have the mirror of my soul, and beam Into thine own the radiance of my trust, Making thee full of an unvanquished hope, Such to believe thyself as I believe thee; And then indeed thou art invincible, Full-winged for flight, sharp-taloned for the fray. But hither comes Eulice to give me joy And tell us all is ready for the bridal. Eulice. Hail, queen! The halls are decked, the chambers strewn, In the high galleries music awaits To charm the passage of the feast. Thy guards Wait in their richest arms, thy senators In rigid robes of gold. I bade attend, In blazoned purple tabards flecked with vair, The pursuivants with clarion-throated tubes, To blare the tidings from the castle-roof To the far country; and on every hill Cressets are raised to kindle at night's noon And quench the fleering stars. The garden trees Are hung with lamps, and the paths purple-strewn With drapets and with tapestries. All the founts Run wine, and in the hamlets and the towns Men carry brimming flagons to the squares, Whither the people throng in festal gear. Aman. Come! time is priceless when high pleasures wait The accomplishment of the deceitful hour. We hold joy like a slippery golden snake, That writhes away, and lets our fingers close On empty air, that clasped his wheeling coils And puffed-out nape, contracted suddenly. Joy is a bud that never grows a flower (For green blight frets or foul worms eat it up), Youth's earnest of fair manhood, beauty's frail And premature disclosure in a child; An eve of moonlight and clear heavens, for which Red tempests lie in wait ambushed in clouds Of burning blood 'neath the pale mountain-peaks; A yellow harvest smutted in the ear; A fair spring day that sings of winter's close, Choked by fresh frost; an early dream of love Sucked in by the wild whirlpool of the world.‚Äî Bid the court hither. Let them hail me bride, And thee, less proud to be a king. Thy brows I'll print with power, thou mine with worthier lips. Herm. So be it, love. I have pledged thee my faith, And never was forsworn. Aman. Here is the court. Guards, do those supple honours to your king You might not to your hero. Both are one, Or on this day shall be so. We proclaim In our joint names a feast of bridal joys. Our land this day is wed to Victory, That ever dwells in this her favourite's hand. My lord, make answer to your people's love And duty. Eulice. Surely, queen, he hears you not: His eyes are fixed far off. Aman. My lord is ill. (Distant music.) Eulice. Queen, mark you yonder, where the river swerves The boat cometh again for Hermadon. With swift circumfluous course, like a reined steed, Round the land's first abuttal. The clear tide That swells with vitreous wave 'twixt the green banks Mirrors a barque that shines as it were sheathed In plates of mother-of-pearl or studded o'er With opals; and I see a link√®d team Of silver-feathered swans that draw the boat By traces of green weed and twisted grass, All habited in like caparison. One in the stern stands up, in her left hand Gathering the glossy ribands of the reins, And in her right she holds a pearly oar And steers. Her brows are bound with daylilies, And the arched agate prow of the frail car Is heaped with wild festoons of water-plants That trail their starry flowers in the pale flood. And 'twixt her eyes, upon her temples white, A burning chrysolite shines greener than An emerald, much like a great green star. Her robes are candent silk, and cling to her Like fire or frost or vapour, the white folds Gathered and locked with gold about the waist. Her bare feet are firm planted on the deck, Whose slippery metal on its polished face Mirrors the whiteness of her ankles fine: No dizening bands or buskins garnish them, But they are naked. 'Neath the boat's high stern The dimpled dead-water shines ghastly green, And farther in its wake the defluous curves Broil in green bubbles, meeting without foam, And dimple away in little whirling rings Far down the river. Herm. Thou art come, Elzir! I have long waited for deliverance In numb forgetfulness. I know thee now. Elzir. I come to claim mine own. Your purposed king, The Queen of Beauty reproveth Earthly Love. Queen, is a king of fa√´ry, and my love. Had you forgot what day he came to you, And in what guise, a champion lent by Heaven? Seemed he as one to bind with silken cords, A hawk to gyve with jesses, a tame hound To collar with the circlet of your crown, To kill his freedom and bring low his pride, Shut out from free communion with his kind? Or seemed he anywise a mate for you? Aman. Spirit, if I have sinned presumptuously, Love be my mediator, who made me sin, And whom o'er all I injure by my sin,‚Äî Aspiring-humble Love, that spans the gulf 'Twixt god and man by the heart's effluent power And strong outreaching arms of great desire. But Love, that having lifted, casts us down With mild correction, loving equal mates, And bidding like to like give level love. Elzir. You are forgiven, for atonement dwells For love unworthy in the waking pain That finds itself unworthy and alone. You may not keep him. Aman. Ah sweet Hermadon, Is there no hope? Beseech her! Herm. Love of loves! Lives there no cure for this? I would not stay, But I have pity. Elzir. Either you must come, And do this cruelty, or forever rest A frigid mortal. Your life's mingled flood, Half-earthly, half of heaven, runs on a point, The spur of a great mountain: on this side, Or yet on that, a channel waits for you. You cannot tunnel through the mountain's heart. There is no third way. Herm. Wherefore was I born, Hermadon wavereth betwixt Earthly Or this choice laid upon me? I look back, And call to mind my home in the Hid Isle. Love and the Queen of Beauty. No woman's love can kindle the cold world, But having lived there with the burning flowers Fanned by the ocean-winds, I still must seem A stranger here, an exile. The damp air Weighs on me, and the cold of human hearts Like a wet robe on flame. The energic heat Of my soul's passion, stifled, preys on me. I grope in gloom: I struggle with dead weights: I am pressed flat under whole seas of death. I shoot the burning arrows of my hate; They fall in sand. I loose my carrier-dove With scrolls of love. It faints in the thin air, Too thin to feed it with keen breath of life Or buoy its soaring wings. I would be gone, Lest I become a demon, an Apollyon, And fill the world with wreck and ravages, Destroying all things that deserve not life. Yet when I think of thee, my gentle queen, It pains my heart. If I were but as one To whom the earth were kindred, and could rest, As others rest, upon her kindly lap, I would not leave thee. I bleed for thy pain, But the impetuous impulse of a power Stronger than pity bears me hence. A fire, A whirlwind-cloud of flame chariots me hence Unto the calm seats of the bless√®d ones, To mine Olympian home. I cannot stay. I will not stay. I will not doubt and fear, And love with half a heart a mortal love. Lead me from her, Elzir. Hark! in the air The soft vibrations of immortal lutes. I feel a great peace growing in my soul. Where have I been, Elzir? I have dreamed long. And is this dying, or waking, or new birth? Elzir. Come! for they tarry for thee in thy home. He passeth again to his home in the Hid Isle. (The barque bears him away.) NOTE ON PAGES 30, 31. Aladinist is the Mahometan name for a free-thinker. Al Araaf is the barrier between Heaven and Hell. I am aware that the expression ‚Äúthe Alkoran‚Äù is, strictly speaking, redundant. The peculiar use of the word Elysian may be defended by such analogies as ‚Äúthe empyrean,‚Äù &amp;c.</field>
