      <field name="fulltext">PART I. SCENE, a Shepherd's Tent on a Plain. DAVID , under a spreading tree, plays on his harp, and sings. I. Great Lord of all things! pow'r divine! Breathe on this erring heart of mine Thy grace serene and pure; Defend my frail, my erring youth, And teach me this important truth, The humble are secure. II. Teach me to bless my lowly lot, Confin'd to this paternal cot, Remote from regal state; Content to court the cooling glade, Inhale the breeze, enjoy the shade, And love my humble fate. III. No anxious vigils here I keep, No dreams of gold distract my sleep, Nor lead my heart astray; Nor blasting Envy's tainted gale Pollutes the pleasures of the vale, To vex my harmless day. IV. Yon' tow'r which rears its head so high, And bids defiance to the sky, Invites the hostile winds: Yon' branching oak extending wide, Provokes destruction by its pride, And courts the fall it finds. V. Then let me shun th' ambitious deed, And all the dangerous paths which lead To honours falsely won. Lord! in thy sure protection blest, Submissive will I ever rest, And may thy will be done! [He lays down his harp, and rises. DAVID. This shepherd's life were dull and tasteless all, Without the charm of soothing song or harp: With it, not undelightful is the haunt Of wood, or lonely grove, or russet plain, Made vocal by the muse. With this lov'd harp, This daily solace of my cares, I sooth'd The melancholy monarch, when he lay, Smit by the chill and spirit-quenching hand Of blank despair. God of my fathers! hear me: Here I devote my harp, my verse, myself, To thy blest service! gladly to proclaim Glory to God on high, on earth good-will To man; to pour my grateful soul before thee; To sing thy pow'r, thy wisdom, and thy love, And every gracious attribute: to paint The charms of heav'n-born virtue! So shall I, (Tho' with long interval of worth) aspire To imitate the work of saints above, Of Cherub and of Seraphim. My heart, My talents, all I am, and all I have, Is thine, O Father! Gracious Lord! accept The humble dedication! Offer'd gifts Of slaughter'd bulls, and goats sacrifical, Thou hast refus'd: but lo! I come, O Lord, To do thy will! the living sacrifice Of an obedient heart I lay before thee! This humble offering more shall please Thee, Lord! Than horned bullocks, ceremonial rites, New moons, appointed passovers, and fasts! Yet those I too will keep; but not instead Of holiness substantial, inward worth; As commutation cheap for pious deeds, And purity of life. But as the types Of better things: as fair external signs Of inward holiness and secret truth. But see, my father, good old Jesse comes! To cheer the setting evening of whose life, Content, a simple shepherd here I dwell, Tho' Israel is in arms, and royal Saul, Encamp'd in yonder field, defies Philistia. JESSE, DAVID. JESSE. Blest be the gracious Pow'r who gave my age To boast a son like thee! Thou art the staff Which props my bending years, and makes me bear The heavy burthen of declining age With fond complacence. How unlike thy fate, O venerable Eli! But two sons, But only two, to gild the dim remains Of life's departing day, and bless thy age, And both were curses to thee! Witness, Heav'n! In all the tedious catalogue of pains Humanity turns o'er, if there be one So terrible to human tenderness, As an unnatural child! DAVID. O, my lov'd father! Long may'st thou live, in years and honours rich; To taste, and to communicate the joys, The thousand fond, endearing charities Of tenderness domestic; Nature's best And loveliest gift, with which she well atones The niggard boon of fortune. JESSE. O, my son! Of all the graces which adorn thy youth, I, with a father's fondness, must commend Thy tried humility. For tho' the Seer Pour'd on thy chosen head the sacred oil, In sign of future greatness, in sure pledge Of highest dignity; yet here thou dwell'st, Content with toil, and careless of repose; And (harder still for an ingenuous mind) Content to be obscure: content to watch, With careful eye, thine humble father's flock! O, earthly emblem of celestial things! So Israel's shepherd watches o'er his fold; The weak ones in his soft'ring bosom bears, And gently leads, in his sustaining hand, The feeble ones with young. DAVID. Know'st thou, my father, Ought from the field? for tho' so near the camp, Tho' war's proud ensigns stream on yonder plain, And all Philistia's swarming hosts encamp, Oppos'd to royal Saul, beneath whose banners My brothers lift the spear; I have not left My fleecy charge, by thee committed to me, To learn the present fortune of the war. JESSE. And wisely hast thou done. Thrice happy land, Who shall submit one day to his command Who can so well obey! Obedience leads To certain honours. Not the tow'ring wing Of eagle-plum'd ambition mounts so surely To Fortune's highest summit, as obedience. [A distant sound of trumpets. But why that sudden ardour, O my son? That trumpet's sound (tho' so remote its voice, We hardly catch the echo as it dies) Has rous'd the mantling blood in thy young cheek: Kindled the martial spirit in thine eye, And my young shepherd feels an hero's fire! DAVID. Thou hast not told the posture of the war, And much my beating bosom pants to hear. JESSE. Uncertain is the fortune of the field. I tremble for thy brothers, thus expos'd To constant peril; nor for them alone, Does the quick feeling agonize my heart. I too lament, that desolating war Hangs his fell banner o'er my native land, Belov'd Jerusalem! O war, what art thou? After the brightest conquest, what remains Of all thy glories? For the vanquish'd, chains! For the proud victor, what? Alas! to reign O'er desolated nations! a drear waste, By one man's crime, by one man's lust of pow'r, Unpeopled! Naked plains and ravag'd fields Succeed to smiling harvests, and the fruits Of peaceful olive, luscious fig and vine! Here, rifled temples are the cavern'd dens Of savage beasts, or haunt of birds obscene. There, populous cities, blacken in the sun, And in the gen'ral wreck, proud palaces Lie undistinguish'd, save by the dun smoke Of recent conflagration. When the song Of dear-bought joy, with many a triumph swell'd, Salutes the victor's ear, and sooths his pride, How is the grateful harmony profaned With the sad dissonance of virgins' cries, Who mourn their brothers slain! Of matrons hoar, Who clasp their wither'd hands, and fondly ask, With iteration shrill, their slaughter'd sons! How is the laurel's verdure stain'd with blood, And soil'd with widows' tears! DAVID. Thrice mournful truth! Yet when our country's rights, her sacred laws, Her holy faith are scorn'd and trampled on, Then, then religion calls; then God himself Commands us to defend his injur'd name. 'Twere then inglorious weakness, mean self-love, To lie inactive, when the stirring voice Of the shrill trumpet wakes to desp'rate deeds; Nor with heroic valour boldly dare Th' idolatrous heathen bands, ev'n to the death. JESSE. God and thy country claim the life they gave, No other cause can sanctify resentment. DAVID. Sure virtuous friendship is a noble cause! O were the princely Jonathan in danger, How wou'd I die, well-pleas'd, in his defence! When ('twas long since, then but a stripling boy) I made short sojourn in his father's palace, (At first to sooth his troubled mind with song, His armour-bearer next); I well remember The gracious bounties of the gallant prince. How wou'd he sit, attentive to my strain, While to my harp I sung the harmless joys Which crown a shepherd's life! How wou'd he cry, Bless'd youth! far happier in thy native worth, Far richer in the talent Heav'n has lent thee, Than if a crown hung o'er thy anxious brow. The jealous monarch mark'd our growing friendship; And as my favour grew with those about him, His royal bounty lessen'd, till at length, For Bethl'hem's safer shades I left the court. Nor wou'd these alter'd features now be known, Grown into manly strength; nor this chang'd form, Enlarg'd with age, and clad in russet weed. JESSE. I have employment for thee, my lov'd son, Will please thy active spirit. Go, my boy! Haste to the field of war, to yonder camp, Where, in the vale of Elah, mighty Saul Commands the hosts of Israel. Greet thy brothers: Observe their deeds; note their demeanor well; And mark if wisdom on their actions waits. Bear to them too (for well the waste of war Will make it needful) such plain healthful viands, As furnish out our frugal shepherd's board. And to the valiant captain of their host, Present such rural gifts as suit our fortune. Heap'd on the board within my tent thou'lt find them. DAVID. With joy I'll bear thy presents to my brothers, And to the valiant captain of their host, The rural gifts thy gratitude assigns him. What transport to behold the tented field, The pointed spear, the blaze of shields and arms, And all the proud accoutrements of war! But, oh! far dearer transport wou'd it yield me, Cou'd this right arm alone avenge the cause Of injur'd Israel, and preserve the lives Of guiltless thousands, doom'd perhaps to bleed! JESSE. Let not thy youth be dazzled, O my son! With deeds of bold emprize, as valour only Were virtue; and the gentle arts of peace, Of truth and justice, were not worth thy care. When thou shalt view the splendors of the war, The gay caparison, the burnish'd shield, The plume-crown'd helmet, and the glitt'ring spear, Scorn not the humble virtues of the shade; Nor think that Heav'n views only with applause The active merit, and the busy toil Of heroes, statesmen, and the bustling sons Of public care. These have their just reward In wealth, in honours, and the well-earn'd fame Their high atchievements bring. 'Tis in this sense That virtue is her proper recompence. Wealth, as its natural consequence, will flow From industry; toil with success is crown'd: From splendid actions high renown will spring. Such is the usual course of human things. For Wisdom Infinite permits that thus Effects to causes be proportionate, And nat'ral ends by nat'ral means atchiev'd. But in the future estimate which Heav'n Will make of things terrestrial, know, my son, That no inferior recompence belongs To the mild passive virtues; meek Content, Heroic self-denial, nobler far Than all th' atchievements noisy Fame reports, When her shrill trump proclaims the proud success Which desolates the nations. But, on earth, These are not always fortunate; because Eternal Justice keeps them for the bliss Of final recompence, for the dread day Of gen'ral retribution. O my son! The ostentatious virtues which still press For notice, and for praise; the brilliant deeds Which live but in the eye of observation, These have their meed at once. But there's a joy To the fond votaries of Fame unknown; To hear the still small voice of conscience speak Its whisp'ring plaudit to the silent soul. Heav'n notes the sigh afflicted Goodness heaves; Hears the low plaint by human ear unheard, And from the cheek of patient Sorrow wipes The tear, by mortal eye unseen or scorn'd. DAVID. As morning dews their grateful freshness shed, And cheer the herbage, and the flow'rs renew; So do thy words a quick'ning balm infuse, And grateful sink in my delighted soul. JESSE. Go then, my child! and may the Gracious God, Who bless'd our fathers, bless my much-lov'd son! DAVID. Farewell, my father! and of this be sure, That not a precept from thy honour'd lips Shall fall, by me unnoticed; not one grace, One venerable virtue, which adorns Thy daily life, but I, with watchful care, And due observance, will in mine transplant it. [Exit David. JESSE. He's gone! and still my aching eyes pursue, And strain their orbs still longer to behold him. Oh! who can tell when I may next embrace him? Who can declare the counsels of the Lord? Or when the moment pre-ordain'd by Heav'n To fill his high designs may come? This son, This blessing of my age, is set apart For high exploits; the chosen instrument Of all-disposing Heav'n for mighty deeds. Still I recal the day, and to my mind The scene is ever present, when the Seer, Illustrious Samuel, to the humble shades Of Bethlehem came, pretending sacrifice, To screen his errand from the jealous king. He sanctify'd us first, me, and my sons; For sanctity increas'd should still precede Increase of dignity. When he declar'd He came, commission'd from on High, to find, Among the sons of Jesse, Israel's king; Astonishment entranc'd my wond'ring soul. Yet was it not a wild tumultuous bliss; Such rash delight as promis'd honours yield To light, vain minds: no, 'twas a doubtful joy Chastis'd by tim'rous virtue, lest a gift So splendid, and so dang'rous, might destroy Him it was meant to raise. My eldest born, Young Eliab, tall of stature, I presented; But God, who judges not by outward form, But tries the heart, forbad the holy prophet To chuse my eldest born. For Saul, he said, Gave proof, that fair proportion, and the grace Of limb or feature, ill repaid the want Of virtue. All my other sons alike By Samuel were rejected: till, at last, On my young boy, on David's chosen head, The prophet pour'd the consecrated oil. Yet ne'er did pride elate him, ne'er did scorn For his rejected elders swell his heart. Not in such gentle charity to him His haughtier brothers live: but all he pardons. To meditation, and to humble toil, To pray'r, and praise, devoted here he dwells. O may the Graces, which adorn retreat, One day delight a court! record his name With saints and prophets, dignify his race, Instruct mankind, and sanctify a world!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART II. SCENE, The Camp. ELIAB, ABINADAB, ABNER, ISRAELITES. ELIAB. Still is th' event of this long war uncertain: Still do the adverse hosts, on either side, Protract, with ling'ring caution, an encounter, Which must to one be fatal. ABINADAB. This descent, Thus to the very confines of our land, Proclaims the sanguine hope that fires the foe. In Ephes-dammim boldly they encamp: Th' uncircumcis'd Philistines pitch their tents On Judah's hallow'd earth. ELIAB. Full forty days Has the insulting giant, proud Goliath, The champion of Philistia, fiercely challeng'd Some Israelitish foe. But who so vain To dare such force unequal? who so bent On sure destruction, to accept his terms, And rush on death beneath the giant force Of his enormous bulk? ABINADAB. 'Tis near the time, When, in th' adjacent valley which divides Th' opposing armies, he is wont to make His daily challenge. ELIAB. Much I marvel, brother! No greetings from our father reach our ears. With ease and plenty bless'd, he little recks The daily hardships which his sons endure. But see! behold his darling son approaches! ABINADAB. How, David here? whence this unlook'd for guest? ELIAB. A spy upon our actions; sent, no doubt, To scan our deeds, with beardless gravity Affecting wisdom; to observe each word, To magnify the venial faults of youth, And construe harmless mirth to foul offence. Enter DAVID. DAVID. All hail, my dearest brothers! ELIAB. Means thy greeting True love, or arrogant scorn? DAVID. Oh, most true love! Sweet as the precious ointment which bedew'd The sacred head of Aaron, and descended Upon his hallow'd vest; so sweet, my brothers, Is fond fraternal amity; such love As my touch'd bosom feels at your approach. ELIAB. Still that fine glozing speech, those holy saws, And all that trick of studied sanctity, Of smooth-turn'd periods, and trim eloquence, Which charms thy doating father. But confess, What dost thou here? Is it to soothe thy pride, And gratify thy vain desire to roam, In quest of pleasures unallow'd? or com'st thou, A willing spy, to note thy brother's deeds? Where hast thou left those few poor straggling sheep? More suited to thy ignorance and years The care of those, than here to wander idly. Why cam'st thou hither? DAVID. Is there not a cause? Why that displeasure kindling in thine eye, My angry brother? why those taunts unkind? Not idly bent on sport; not to delight Mine eye with all this gay parade of war; To gratify a roving appetite, Or fondly to indulge a curious ear With any tale of rumour, am I come: But to approve myself a loving brother. I bring the blessing of your aged sire, With gifts of such plain cates, and rural viands, As suit his frugal fortune. Tell me now Where the bold captain of your host encamps? ELIAB. Wherefore enquire? what boots it thee to know? Behold him there: great Abner, fam'd in arms! DAVID. I bring thee, mighty Abner, from my father, (A simple shepherd swain in yonder vale) Such humble gifts as shepherd swains bestow. ABNER. Thanks, gentle youth! with pleasure I receive The grateful off'ring. Why does thy quick eye Thus wander with unsatisfied delight? DAVID. New as I am to all the trade of war, Each sound has novelty; each thing I see Attracts attention; every noise I hear Awakes confus'd emotions; indistinct, Yet full of charming tumult, sweet distraction. 'Tis all delightful hurry! Oh! the joy Of young ideas painted on the mind, In the warm glowing colours fancy spreads On objects not yet known, when all is new, And all is lovely! Ah! what warlike sound Salutes my ravish'd ear? [Sound of Trumpet. ABNER. 'Tis the Philistine, Proclaiming, by his herald, through the ranks, His near approach. Each morning he repeats His challenge to our bands. DAVID. Ha! what Philistine? Who is he? ELIAB. Wherefore ask? for thy raw youth, And rustic ignorance, 'twere fitter learn Some rural art; some secret to prevent Contagion in thy flocks; some better means To save their fleece immaculate. These mean arts, Of soft inglorious peace, far better suit Thy low obscurity, than thus to seek High things, pertaining to exploits of arms. DAVID. Urg'd as I am, I will not answer thee. Who conquers his own spirit, O my brother! He is the only conqueror.—Again That shout mysterious! Pray you tell me who This proud Philistine is, who sends defiance To Israel's hardy chieftains? ABNER. Stranger youth! So lovely and so mild is thy demeanor, So gentle, and so patient; such the air Of candor and of courage, which adorns Thy blooming features, thou hast won my love; And I will tell thee. DAVID. Mighty Abner! thanks! ABNER. Thrice, and no more, he sounds, his daily rule, This man of war, this champion of Philistia, Is of the sons of Anak's giant-race. Goliath is his name. His fearful stature, Unparallel'd in Israel, measures more Than twice two cubits. On his tow'ring head A helm of burnish'd brass the giant wears, So pond'rous, it wou'd crush the stoutest man In all our hosts. A coat of mailed armour Guards his capacious trunk; compar'd with which The amplest oak, that spreads his rugged arms In Bashan's groves, were small. About his neck A shining corslet hangs. On his vast thigh The plaited cuirass firmly jointed stands. But who shall tell the wonders of his spear, And hope to gain belief? of massive iron Its temper'd frame; not less than the broad beam To which the busy weaver hangs his loom; Not to be wielded by a mortal hand, Save by his own. An armour-bearer walks Before this mighty champion, in his hand Bearing the giant's shield. Thrice, every morn, His herald sounds the trumpet of defiance, Off'ring at once to end the long-drawn war, In single combat, 'gainst that hardy foe Who dares encounter him. DAVID. Say, mighty Abner! What are the haughty terms of his defiance? ABNER. Proudly he stalks around th' extremest bounds Of Elah's valley. His herald sounds the note Of offer'd battle. Then the furious giant, With such a voice as from the troubled sky, In vollied thunder, breaks, thus sends his challenge: “Why do you set your battle in array, Ye men of Israel? Wherefore waste the lives Of needless thousands? Why protract a war Which may at once be ended? Are not you Servants to Saul your king? and am not I, With triumph let me speak it, a Philistine? Chuse out a man from all your armed hosts, Of courage most approv'd, and I will meet him, His single arm to mine. Th' event of this Shall fix the fate of Israel and Philistia. If victory favour him, then will we live Your tributary slaves; but if my arm Be crown'd with conquest, you shall then live ours, Give me a man, if your effeminate bands A man can boast. Your armies I defy.” DAVID. What shall be done to him who shall subdue This vile idolator? ABNER. He shall receive Such ample bounties, such profuse rewards, As might inflame chill age, or cowardice, Were not the odds so desperate. DAVID. Say what are they? ABNER. The royal Saul has promis'd that bold hero, Who shall encounter and subdue Goliath, All dignity and favour; that his house Shall be set free from tribute, and ennobled With the first honours Israel has to give. And for the gallant conqueror himself, No less a recompence than the fair princess, Our monarch's peerless daughter. DAVID. Beauteous Michal! It is indeed a boon which kings might strive for. And has none answer'd yet this bold defiance? What, all this goodly host of Israelites, God's own peculiar people! all afraid T' assert God's injur'd honour and their own? The king himself, who in his early youth Wrought deeds of fame! the princely Jonathan! Not so the gallant youth Philistia fear'd At Bozez and at Seneh 1 Samuel, xiv.; when the earth Shook from her deep foundations to behold The wondrous carnage of his single hand On the uncircumcis'd. When he exclaim'd, With glorious confidence—“Shall numbers awe me? “God will protect his own: with him to save, “It boots not, friends, by many or by few.” This was an hero! Why does he delay To meet this boaster? For thy courtesy, Thrice noble Abner, I am bound to thank thee! Woud'st thou complete thy gen'rous offices? I dare not ask it. ABNER. Speak thy wishes freely. My soul inclines to serve thee. DAVID. Then, O Abner, Conduct me to the king! There is a cause Will justify this boldness. ELIAB. Braggard, hold! ABNER. I take thee at thy word, and will, with speed, Conduct thee to my royal master's presence. In yonder tent, the anxious monarch waits Th' event of this day's challenge. DAVID. Noble Abner! Accept my thanks. Now to thy private ear, If so thy grace permit, I will unfold My secret soul, and ease my lab'ring breast, Which pants with high designs, and beats for glory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART III. SCENE, Saul's Tent. SAUL. Why was I made a king? what I have gain'd In envy'd greatness and uneasy pow'r, I've lost in peace of mind, in virtue lost! Why did deceitful transports fire my soul, When Samuel plac'd upon my youthful brow The crown of Israel? I had known content, Nay happiness, if happiness unmix'd To mortal man were known, had I still liv'd Among the humble tents of Benjamin. A shepherd's occupation was my joy, And ev'ry guiltless day was crown'd with peace. But now, a sullen cloud for ever hangs O'er the faint sunshine of my brightest hours, Dark'ning the golden promise of the morn. I ne'er shall taste the dear domestic joys My meanest subjects know. True, I have sons, Whose virtues wou'd have charm'd a private man, And drawn down blessings on their humble sire. I love their virtues too; but 'tis a love Which jealousy has poison'd. Jonathan Is all a father's fondness cou'd conceive Of amiable and good—Of that no more! He is too popular; the people doat Upon th' ingenuous graces of his youth. Curs'd popularity! which makes a father Detest the merit of a son he loves. How did their fond idolatry perforce, Rescue his sentenc'd life, when doom'd by lot To perish at Beth-aven 1 Samuel, xiv., for the breach Of strict injunction, that of all my bands, Not one that day shou'd taste of food, and live. My subjects clamour at this tedious war, Yet of my num'rous armed chiefs, not one Has courage to engage this man of Gath. O for a champion bold enough to face This giant-boaster, whose repeated threats Strike thro' my inmost soul! There was a time— Of that no more!—I am not what I was. Shou'd valiant Jonathan accept the challenge, Twou'd but increase his favour with the people, And make the crown sit loosely on my brow. Ill cou'd my wounded spirit brook the voice Of harsh comparison 'twixt sire and son. SAUL, ABNER. ABNER. What meditation holds thee thus engag'd, O king! and keeps thine active spirit bound, When busy war far others cares demands Than ruminating thought, and pale despair? SAUL. Abner, draw near. My weary soul sinks down Beneath the heavy pressure of misfortune. O for that spirit which inflam'd my breast With sudden fervor, when, among the seers, And holy sages, my prophetic voice Was heard attentive, and th' astonish'd throng, Wond'ring, exclaim'd, “is Saul among the prophets?” Where's that bold arm which quell'd th' Amalekite, And nobly spar'd fierce Agag and his flocks? 'Tis past; the light of Israel now is quench'd: Shorn of his beams, my sun of glory sets! Rise Moab, Edom, angry Ammon, rise! Come Gaza, Ashdod come! let Ekron boast, And Askelon rejoice, for Saul—is nothing. ABNER. I bring thee news, O king! SAUL. My valiant uncle! What can avail thy news? A soul oppress'd, Refuses still to hear the charmer's voice, Howe'er enticingly he charm. What news Can sooth my sickly soul, while Gath's fell giant Repeats each morning to my frighten'd hosts His daring challenge—none accepting it? ABNER. It is accepted. SAUL. Ha! by whom? how? when? What prince, what gen'ral, what illustrious hero, What vet'ran chief, what warrior of renown, Will dare to meet the haughty foe's defiance? Speak, my brave gen'ral! noble Abner, speak! ABNER. No prince, no warrior, no illustrious chief, No vet'ran hero dares accept the challenge; But what will move thy wonder, mighty king! One train'd to peaceful deeds, and new to arms, A simple shepherd swain. SAUL. O mockery! No more of this light tale, it suits but ill Thy bearded gravity; or rather tell it To credulous age, or weak believing women; They love whate'er is marvellous, and doat On deeds prodigious and incredible, Which sober sense rejects. I laugh to think Of thy extravagance. A shepherd's boy Encounter him whom nations dread to meet! ABNER. Is valour, then, peculiar to high birth? If Heav'n had so decreed, know, scornful king, That Saul the Benjamite had never reign'd. No:—Glory darts her soul-pervading ray, On thrones and cottages, regardless still Of all the false, chimerical distinctions Vain human customs make. SAUL. Where is this youth? ABNER. Without thy tent he waits. Such humble sweetness, Fir'd with the secret conscience of desert; Such manly bearing, tempered with such softness, And so adorn'd with every outward charm Of graceful form and feature, saw I never. SAUL. Bring me the youth. ABNER. He waits thy royal pleasure. [Exit Abner. SAUL. What must I think? Abner himself is brave, And skill'd in human kind: nor does he judge So lightly, to be caught by specious words, And fraud's smooth artifice, without the marks Of worth intrinsic. But behold he comes! The youth too with him! Justly did he praise The candor which adorns his open brow. Re-enter ABNER and DAVID. DAVID. Hail, mighty king! ABNER. Behold thy proffer'd champion. SAUL. Art thou the youth whose high heroic zeal Aspires to meet the giant son of Anak? DAVID. If so the king permit. SAUL. Impossible! Why what experience has thy youth of arms? Where didst thou learn the dreadful trade of war? Beneath what hoary vet'ran hast thou serv'd? What seats atchiev'd, what deeds of bold emprize? What well-rang'd phalanx, and what charging hosts, What hard campaigns, what sieges hast thou seen? Hast thou e'er scal'd the city's rampir'd wall, Or hurl'd the missile dart, or learn'd to poise The warrior's deathful spear? The use of targe, Of helm and buckler is to thee unknown. DAVID. Arms I have never seen. I nothing know Of war's proud discipline. The trumpet's clang, The shock of charging hosts, the rampir'd wall, Th' embattled phalanx, and the warrior spear, The use of targe and helm to me is new. My zeal for God, my patriot love of Israel, And reverence for my king, these are my claims. SAUL. But, gentle youth, thou hast no fame in arms. Renown, with her shrill clarion, never bore Thy honour'd name to many a land remote. From the fair regions where Euphrates laves Assyria's borders to the distant Nile. DAVID. True, mighty king! I am indeed alike Unbless'd by Fortune, and to Fame unknown; A lowly shepherd-swain of Judah's tribe. But greatness ever springs from low beginnings. That very Nile thou mention'st, whose broad stream Bears fruitfulness and health thro' many a clime, From an unknown, penurious, scanty source, Took its first rise. The forest oak which shades Thy sultry troops in many a toilsome march, Once an unheeded acorn lay. O king! Who ne'er begins, can never ought atchieve Of glorious. Thou thyself wast once unknown, 'Till fair occasion brought thy worth to light. Sublimer views inspire my youthful heart, Than human praise: I seek to vindicate Th' insulted honour of the God thou serv'st. ABNER. 'Tis nobly said. SAUL. I love thy spirit, youth! But dare not trust thy inexperienc'd arm Against a giant's might. The sight of blood, Tho' brave thou feel'st when peril is not nigh, Will pale thy ardent cheek. DAVID. Not so, O king! This youthful arm has been imbru'd in blood, Tho' yet no blood of man has ever stain'd it. Thy servant's occupation is a shepherd. With jealous care I watch'd my father's flock: A brindled lion, and a furious bear, Forth from the thicket rush'd upon the fold, Seiz'd a young lamb, and tore their bleating spoil. Urg'd by compassion for my helpless charge, I felt a new-born vigour nerve my arm, And, eager, on the foaming monsters rush'd. The famish'd lion by his griesly beard, Enrag'd, I caught, and smote him to the ground. The panting monster struggling in my gripe, Shook terribly his bristling mane, and lash'd His own gaunt, goary sides; fiercely he ground His gnashing teeth, and roll'd his starting eyes, Bloodshot with agony: then with a groan, That wak'd the echoes of the mountain, dy'd. Nor did his grim associate 'scape my arm; Thy servant slew the lion and the bear, I kill'd them both, and bore their shaggy spoils In triumph home. And shall I fear to meet Th' uncircumcis'd Philistine? No: that God Who sav'd me from the bear's destructive fang, And hungry lion's jaw, will not he save me From this Idolater? SAUL. He will, he will! Go, noble youth! be valiant and be bless'd! The God thou serv'st will shield thee in the fight, And nerve thy arm with more than mortal strength. ABNER. So the bold Nazarite Sampson. See Judges, chap. xiv. a lion slew, An earnest of his victories o'er Philistia. SAUL. Go, Abner! see the youth be well equipp'd With shield and spear. Be it thy care to grace him With all the fit accoutrements of war. The choicest mail from my rich armory take, And gird upon his thigh my own try'd sword, Of noblest temper'd steel. ABNER. I shall obey. DAVID. Pardon, O king! the coat of plaited mail, These limbs have never known; it wou'd not shield, 'Twou'd but encumber one who never felt The weight of armour. SAUL. Take thy wish, my son. Thy sword then, and the God of Jacob guard thee!</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART IV. SCENE, another Part of the Camp. DAVID. Eternal Justice, in whose awful scale Th' event of battle hangs! Eternal Mercy, Whose universal beam illumines all! If, by thy attributes I may, unblam'd, Address thee; Lord of glory, hear me now! O teach these hands to war, these arms to fight! Thou ever present help in time of need! Let thy broad mercy, as a shield, defend, And let thine everlasting arms support me! Then, tho' the heathen rage, I shall not fear. Jehovah! be my buckler. Mighty Lord! Thou, who hast deign'd by humble instruments, To manifest the marvels of thy might, Be present with me now! 'tis thine own cause! Thy wisdom will foresee, thy goodness chuse, And thy omnipotence will execute Thy high designs, tho' by a feeble arm! I feel a secret impulse drive me on, And my soul springs impatient for the fight. 'Tis not the heated spirits, or warm blood Of sanguine youth; and yet I pant, I burn To meet th' insulting foe. I thirst for glory; Yet not the fading glory of renown, The perishable praise of mortal man. DAVID, ELIAB, ISRAELITES. ELIAB. What do I hear, thou truant? thou hast dar'd, Ev'n to the awful presence of the king, Bear thy presumption! DAVID. He who fears the Lord, Shall boldly stand before the face of kings, And shall not be asham'd. ELIAB. But what wild dream Has urg'd thee to this deed of desp'rate rashness? Thou mean'st, so have I learn'd, to meet Goliath, His single arm to thine. DAVID. 'Tis what I mean, Ev'n on this spot; each moment I expect His wish'd approach. ELIAB. Go home; return, for shame! Nor madly pull destruction on thy head. Thy doating father, when thy shepherd's coat, Drench'd in thy blood is brought him, will lament, And rend his furrow'd cheek, and silver hair, As if some mighty loss had touch'd his age; And mourn, even as the partial patriarch mourn'd, When Joseph's bloody garment he receiv'd, From his less dear, not less deserving, sons. But whence that glitt'ring ornament, which hangs Useless upon thy thigh? DAVID. 'Tis the king's gift. But thou art right; it suits not me, my brother. Nor sword I mean to wear, nor spear to poize, Lest men shou'd say I put my trust in ought, Save an eternal shield. ELIAB. Then thou indeed Art bent to seek thy death. DAVID. And what is death? Is it so terrible to die, my brother? Or grant it terrible, say is it not Inevitable too? If, by eluding death, When some high duty calls us forth to die, We cou'd for ever shun it, and escape The universal lot; then fond self-love, Then human prudence, boldly might produce Their fine-spun arguments, their learn'd harangues, Their cobweb arts, their phrase sophistical, Their subtile doubts, and all the specious trick, Of eloquent cunning lab'ring for its end. But since, howe'er protracted, death will come, Why fondly study, with ingenious pains, To put it off?—To breathe a little longer, Is to defer our fate, but not to shun it: Small gain! which Wisdom with indiff'rent eye Beholds. Why wish to drink the bitter dregs Of life's exhausted chalice, whose last runnings, Ev'n at the best, are vapid? Why not die, If Heav'n so will) in manhood's op'ning bloom, When all the flush of life is gay about us, When sprightly youth, with many a new-born joy, Solicits every sense? So may we then, Present a sacrifice, unmeet, indeed, (Ah, how unmeet!) but more acceptable Than the world's leavings; than a worn-out heart, By vice enfeebled, and by vain desires Sunk and exhausted! ELIAB. Hark! I hear a sound Of multitudes approaching! DAVID. 'Tis the giant! I see him not, but hear his measur'd pace. ELIAB. Look, where his pond'rous shield is borne before him! DAVID. Like a broad moon its ample disk protends. But soft, what unknown prodigy appears? A moving mountain cas'd in polish'd brass! ELIAB. [Getting behind David. How's this? thou dost not tremble. Thy firm joints Betray no fear: Thy accents are not broken: Thy cheek retains its red, thine eye its lustre. He comes more near. Dost thou not fear him now? DAVID. No. The vast colossal statue nor inspires Respect nor fear. Mere magnitude of form, Without proportion'd intellect and valour, Nor strikes my soul with rev'rence nor with awe. ELIAB. Near, and more near, he comes. I hold it rash To stay so near him, and expose a life, Which may hereafter serve the state. Farewell! [Exit. [Goliath advances, clad in complete armour. One bearing his shield precedes him. The opposing armies are seen at a distance, drawn up on each side of the valley. Goliath begins to speak before he comes on. David stands in the same place, with an air of indifference.] GOLIATH. Where is the mighty man of war who dares Accept the challenge of Philistia's chief? What victor-king, what gen'ral drench'd in blood, Claims this high privilege? What are his rights? What proud credentials does the boaster bring To prove his claim? What cities laid in ashes? What ruin'd provinces? What slaughter'd realms? What heads of heroes, and what hearts of kings, In battle kill'd, or at his altars slain, Has he to boast? Is his bright armoury Thick set with spears, and swords and coats of mail, Of vanquish'd nations, by his single arm Subdued? Where is the mortal man so bold, So much a wretch, so out of love with life, To dare the weight of this uplifted spear, Which never fell innoxious? Yet I swear, I grudge the glory to his parting soul To fall by this right-hand. 'Twill sweeten death, To know he had the honour to contend With the dread son of Anak. Latest time From blank oblivion shall retrieve his name, Who dar'd to perish in unequal fight With Gath's triumphant champion. Come, advance! Philistia's Gods to Israel's. Sound, my herald. Sound for the battle strait! [Herald sounds the trumpet. DAVID. Behold thy foe! GOLIATH. I see him not. DAVID. Behold him here! GOLIATH. Say, where? Direct my sight. I do not war with boys. DAVID. I stand prepar'd, thy single arm to mine. GOLIATH. Why, this is mockery, Minion! it may chance To cost thee dear. Sport not with things above thee: But tell me who, of all this num'rous host, Expects his death from me? Which is the man Whom Israel sends to meet my bold defiance? DAVID. Th' election of my sov'reign falls on me. GOLIATH. On thee? on thee? by Dagon 'tis too much! Thou curled Minion! thou a nation's champion! 'Twou'd move my mirth at any other time; But trifling's out of tune. Begone, light boy! And tempt me not too far. DAVID. I do defy thee; Thou foul idolater! hast thou not scorn'd The armies of the living God I serve? By me he will avenge upon thy head Thy nations' sins and thine. Arm'd with his name, Unshrinking, I dare meet the stoutest foe That ever bath'd his hostile spear in blood. GOLIATH, ironically. Indeed! 'tis wondrous well! now, by my Gods, The stripling plays the orator! Vain boy! Keep close to that same bloodless war of words, And thou shalt still be safe. Tongue-valiant warrior! Where is thy sylvan crook, with garlands hung, Of idle field-flowers? Where thy wanton harp, Thou dainty-finger'd hero? better strike Its note lascivious, or the lulling lute Touch softly, than provoke the trumpet's rage. I will not stain the honour of my spear With thy inglorious blood. Shall that fair cheek Be scarr'd with wounds unseemly? Rather go, And hold fond dalliance with the Syrian maids; To wanton measures dance, and let them braid The bright luxuriance of thy golden hair; They, for their lost Adonis, may mistake Thy dainty form. DAVID. Peace, thou unhallow'd railer! O tell it not in Gath, nor let the sound Reach Askelon, how once your slaughter'd Lords, By mighty Judges, chap. xvi. Sampson found one common grave: When his broad shoulder the firm pillars heav'd, And to its base the tott'ring fabric shook. GOLIATH. Insulting boy! perhaps thou hast not heard The infamy of that inglorious day, When your weak hosts at 1 Samuel, chap. v. Eben-ezer pitch'd Their quick-abandon'd tents? Then, when your ark, Your talisman, your charm, your boasted pledge Of safety and success, was tamely lost: And yet not tamely, since by me 'twas won. When with this good right-arm I thinn'd your ranks, And bravely crush'd, beneath a single blow, The chosen guardians of this vaunted shrine, Hophni Commentators say, that the Chaldee Paraphrase makes Goliath boast, that he had killed Hophni and Phineas, and taken the ark prisoner. and Phineas. The fam'd ark itself, I bore to Ashdod. DAVID. I remember too, Since thou provok'st th' unwelcome truth, how all Your blushing priests beheld their idol's shame, When prostrate Dagon fell before the ark, And your frail God was shiver'd. Then Philistia, Idolatrous Philistia flew for succour To Israel's help, and all her smitten nobles Confess'd the Lord was God, and the bless'd ark, Gladly, with reverential awe restor'd! GOLIATH. By Ashdod's fane thou ly'st. Now will I meet thee, Thou insect-warrior! since thou dar'st me thus! Already I behold thy mangled limbs, Dissever'd each from each, e'er long to feed The fierce, blood-snuffing vulture. Mark me well! Around my spear I'll twist thy shining locks, And toss in air thy head all gash'd with wounds; Thy lips, yet quiv'ring with the dire convulsion Of recent death! Art thou not terrified? DAVID. No. True courage is not mov'd by breath of words. But the rash bravery of boiling blood, Impetuous, knows no settled principle. A fev'rish tide, it has its ebbs and flows, As spirits rise or fall, as wine inflames, Or circumstances change. But inborn courage, The gen'rous child of Fortitude and Faith, Holds its firm empire in the constant soul; And, like the stedfast pole-star, never once From the same fix'd and faithful point declines. GOLIATH. The curses of Philistia's gods be on thee! This fine-drawn speech is meant to lengthen out That little life thy words pretend to scorn. DAVID. Ha! say'st thou so? come on then! Mark us well. Thou com'st to me with sword, and spear, and shield! In the dread name of Israel's God I come; The living Lord of Hosts whom thou defy'st! Yet tho' no shield I bring, no arms, except These five smooth stones I gather'd from the brook, With such a simple sling as shepherds use; Yet all expos'd, defenceless as I am, The God I serve shall give thee up a prey To my victorious arm. This day, I mean To make the uncircumcised tribes confess There is a God in Israel. I will give thee, Spite of thy vaunted strength, and giant bulk, To glut the carrion kites. Nor thee alone; The mangled carcasses of your thick hosts, Shall spread the plains of Elah: till Philistia, Thro' all her trembling tents and flying bands, Shall own that Judah's God is God indeed! I dare thee to the trial! GOLIATH. Follow me. In this good spear I trust. DAVID. I trust in Heaven! The God of battles stimulates my arm, And fires my soul with ardor not its own.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART V. SCENE, The Tent of Saul. SAUL, rising from his couch. Oh! that I knew the black and midnight arts Of wizard sorcery! that I cou'd call The slumb'ring spirit from the shades of hell! Or, like Chaldean sages, cou'd foreknow Th' event of things unacted! I might then Anticipate my fortune. How I'm fall'n! The sport of vain chimeras, the weak slave Of fear, and sickly fancy; coveting To know the arts which foul diviners use. Thick blood, and moping melancholy, lead To baleful Superstition, that fell fiend Whose with'ring charms blast the fair bloom of virtue. Why did my wounded pride with scorn reject The wholesome truths which holy Samuel told me? Why drive him from my presence? he might now Raise my sunk soul, and my benighted mind Enlighten with religion's cheering ray. He dared to menace me with loss of empire, And I, for that bold honesty, dismiss'd him. “Another shall possess thy throne, he cry'd, “A stranger!” This unwelcome prophecy Has lin'd my crown, and strew'd my couch with thorns. Each ray of op'ning merit I discern In friend or foe, distracts my troubled soul, Lest he shou'd prove my rival. But this morn, Ev'n my young champion, lovely as he look'd In blooming valour, struck me to the soul With jealousy's barb'd dart. O jealousy! Thou ugliest fiend of hell! thy deadly venom Preys on my vitals, turns the healthful hue Of my fresh cheek to haggard sallowness, And drinks my spirit up! [A flourish of trumpets, shouting, &amp;c. &amp;c. What sounds are those? The combat is decided. Hark! again, Those shouts proclaim it! Now, O God of Jacob, If yet thou hast not quite withdrawn from Saul Thy light and favour, prosper me this once! But Abner comes! I dread to hear his tale. Fair Hope, with smiling face, but ling'ring foot Has long deceiv'd me. ABNER. King of Israel, hail! Now thou art king indeed. The youth has conquer'd. Goliath's slain. SAUL. Oh, speak thy tale again, Lest my fond ears deceive me. ABNER. Thy young champion Has slain the Giant. SAUL. Then God is gracious still, In spite of my offences! But, good Abner, How was it? tell me all! Where is my champion; Quick let me press him to my grateful heart, And pay him a king's thanks. And yet, who knows? This forward friend may prove an active foe. No more of that.—Tell me the whole, brave Abner! And paint the glorious acts of my young hero! ABNER. Full in the centre of the camp they stood. Th' opposing armies rang'd on either side In proud array. The haughty Giant stalk'd, Stately, across the valley. Next the youth With modest confidence advanc'd. Nor pomp, Nor gay parade, nor martial ornament, His graceful form adorn'd. Goliath strait, With solemn state, began the busy work Of dreadful preparation. In one place, His closely jointed mail an op'ning left, For air, and only one: the watchful youth Mark'd that the beaver of his helm was up. Meanwhile the Giant such a blow devis'd, As wou'd have crush'd him; this the youth perceiv'd, And from his well-directed sling, he hurl'd, With dextrous aim, a stone, which sunk, deep lodg'd, In the capacious forehead of the foe. Then with a cry, as loud and terrible, As Lybian lions roaring for their young, Quite stunn'd, the furious Giant stagger'd, reel'd, And fell: the mighty mass of man fell prone. With its own weight his shatter'd bulk was bruis'd. His clattering arms rung dreadful thro' the field, And the firm basis of the solid earth Shook. Chok'd with blood and dust, he curs'd his gods, And dy'd blaspheming! Strait the victor youth Drew from its sheath the Giant's pond'rous sword, And from th' enormous trunk, the goary head, Furious in death, he sever'd. The grim visage Look'd threat'ning still, and still frown'd horribly. SAUL. O glorious deed! O valiant conqueror! ABNER. The youth so calm appear'd, so nobly firm; So cool, yet so intrepid; that these eyes Ne'er saw such temperate valour, so chastis'd By modesty. SAUL. Thou dwell'st upon his praise With needless circumstance. 'Twas nobly done; But others too have fought! ABNER. None, none so bravely. SAUL. What follow'd next? ABNER. The shouting Israelites On the Philistines rush'd, and still pursue Their routed remnants. In dismay, their bands Disorder'd fly. While shouts of loud acclaim Pursue their brave deliverer. Lo, he comes! Bearing the Giant's head, and shining sword, His well-earn'd trophies. SAUL, ABNER, DAVID. [David bearing Goliath's head and sword. He kneels, and lays both at Saul's feet.] SAUL. Welcome to my heart, My glorious champion! my deliverer, welcome! How shall I speak the swelling gratitude Of my full heart? or give thee the high praise Thy gallant deeds deserve? DAVID. O mighty king! Sweet is the breath of praise, when giv'n by those Whose own high merit claims the praise they give. But let not this one fortunate event, By Heav'n directed, be ascrib'd to me. I might have fought with equal skill and courage, And not have gain'd this conquest; then had shame, Harsh obloquy, and foul disgrace, befal'n me. But prosp'rous fortune gains the praise of valour. SAUL. I like not this. In every thing superior! He soars above me (aside). Modest youth, thou'rt right. And fortune, as thou say'st, deserves the praise We give to human valour. DAVID. Rather say, The God of Hosts deserves it. SAUL. Tell me, youth! What is thy name, and what thy father's house? DAVID. My name is David, Jesse is my sire, An humble Bethle'mite of Judah's tribe. SAUL. David, the son of Jesse! Sure that name Has been familiar to me! Nay, thy voice, Thy form and features, I remember too, Tho' faint, and indistinctly. ABNER. In this Hero Behold thy sweet musician, he whose harp Expell'd the melancholy fiend, whose pow'r Enslav'd thy spirit. SAUL. This the modest youth, Whom, for his skill and virtues, I preferr'd To bear my armour? DAVID. I am he, O king! SAUL. Why this concealment? tell me, valiant David! Why didst thou hide thy birth and name till now? DAVID. O king! I wou'd not ought from favour claim, Or on remember'd services presume: But on the strength of my own actions stand, Ungrac'd and unsupported. ABNER. Well he merits The honours which await him. Why, O king! Dost thou delay to bless his doubting heart With his well-earn'd rewards? Thy lovely daughter, By right of conquest his! SAUL, to David. True—thou hast won her. She shall be thine—Yes, a king's word is past. DAVID. O boundless blessing! What, shall she be mine, For whom contending monarchs might renounce Their slighted crowns? [Sounds of musical instruments heard at a distance. Shouting and singing. A grand procession. Chorus of Hebrew Women.] SAUL. How's this? what sounds of joy Salute my ears? what means this pageantry? This merry sound of tabret and of harp? What mean these idle instruments of triumph? These women, who in fair procession move, Making sweet melody? ABNER. To pay due honour To David, are they come. SAUL. [Aside. A rival's praise Is discord to the ear of jealousy! [Martial symphony. After which Chorus of Women sing.] I. PREPARE! your festal rites prepare! Let your triumphs rend the air! Idol gods shall reign no more, We the living Lord adore! Let heathen hosts on human helps repose, Since Israel's God has routed Israel's foes. II. Let remotest nations know, Proud Goliath's overthrow: Fall'n, Philistia! is thy trust, Dagon's honour laid in dust! Who fears the Lord of Glory, need not fear The brazen armour, nor the lifted spear. III. See, the routed squadrons fly! Hark! their clamours rend the sky! Blood and carnage stain the field! See, the vanquish'd nations yield! Dismay and terror fill the frighten'd land; While conq'ring David routs the trembling band. IV. Lo! upon the tented field, Royal Saul has thousands kill'd! Lo! upon th' ensanguin'd plain, David has ten thousand slain! Let mighty Saul his vanquish'd thousands tell, While tenfold triumphs David's victories swell.</field>
