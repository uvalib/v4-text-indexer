      <field name="fulltext">Jesus was led from thens of the sprete into the wyldernes, to be tempted of the devyll. And whan he had fasted fourty dayes and fourty nyghtes, he was at last an hungered. Mathei iiij.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">[Enter Baleus Prolocutor.] Baleus Prolocutor After hys baptyme Christ was Gods sonne declared By the fathers voyce as ye before have hearde; Whych sygnyfyeth to us that we, ones baptysed, Are the sonnes of God by hys gift and rewarde. And bycause that we shuld have Christ in regarde, He gave unto hym the myghtye autoryte Of hys heavenlye worde our only teacher to be. Now is he gone fourth into the desart place, With the holy Ghost, hys offyce to begynne; Where Sathan the devyll with hys assaultes apace, With colours of craft, and manye a subtyle gynne, Wyll undermynde hym: yet nothynge shall he wynne But shame and rebuke in the conclusyon fynall. Thys tokenneth our rayse and hys unrecurable fall. Lerne first in thys acte that we whom Christ doth call Ought not to folowe the fantasyes of Man, But the holy Ghost, as our gyde specyall; Whych to defende us is he that wyll and can. To persecucyon lete us prepare us than, For that wyll folowe in them that seke the truth: Marke in thys processe what troubles to Christ ensuth. Sathan assaulteth hym with many a subtyle dryft, So wyll he do us if we take Christes part; And whan that helpeth not he seketh an other shyft, The rulers amonge, to put Christ unto smart, With so manye els as beare hym their good hart. Be ye sure of thys, as ye are of dayly meate, If ye folowe Christ with hym ye must be beate. For assaultes of Sathan lerne here the remedye; Take the worde of God, lete that be your defence. So wyll Christ teache yow in our next comedye; Ernestly prent it in your quyck intellygence; Resyst not the worlde but with meke pacyence, If ye be of Christ. Of thys herafter ye shall Perceyve more at large by the story as it fall. [Exit.]</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A BREFE COMEDY OR ENTERLUDE CONCERNYNGE THE TEMPTACYON OF OUR LORDE AND SAVER JESUS CHRIST BY SATHAN IN THE DESART. Compyled by Johan Bale, Anno 1538. Incipit Comoedia [Enter Jesus Christus.] Jesus Christus Into thys desart the holy Ghost hath brought me, After my baptyme of Sathan to be tempted. Therby to instruct of Man the imbecyllyte, That after he hath Gods holy sprete receyved Dyversely he must of Sathan be impugned; Least he for Gods gyft shuld fall into a pryde, And that in parell he take me for hys gyde. Thynke not me to fast bycause I wolde yow to fast, For than ye thynke wronge and have vayne judgement. But of my fastynge thynke rather thys my cast: Sathan to provoke to worke hys cursed intent, And to teache yow wayes hys myschefes to prevent By the worde of God, whych must be your defence Rather than fastynges, to withstande hys vyolence. I have fasted here the space of forty dayes, Perfourmynge that fast whych Moses had in fygure, To stoppe their mouthes with, whych bable and prate alwayes, âThus ded our fathers,â my name and fame to dysvygure. Therefor now I tast of fastynge here the rygure, And am ryght hungrye after longe abstynence; Thys mortall bodye complayneth of indygence. [Enter Satan Tentator.] Satan Tentator No where I fourther, but every where I noye, For I am Sathan, the commen adversarye, An enemy to Man, hym sekynge to destroye And to brynge to nought by my assaultes most craftye. I watche every where, wantynge no polycye To trappe hym in snare, and make hym the chylde of hell: What nombre I wynne it were very longe to tell. I hearde a great noyse in Jordane now of late, Upon one Jesus, soundynge from heaven above: âThys is myne owne sonne whych hath withdrawne al hate, And he that doth stande most hyghly in my love.â My wyttes the same sounde doth not a lyttle move; He cometh to redeme the kynde of Man, I feare. Hygh tyme is it than for me the cooles to steare. I wyll not leave hym tyll I knowe what he ys, And what he entendeth in thys same border heare. Subtyltie must helpe, els all wyll be amys: A godlye pretence outwardly must I beare, Semynge relygyouse, devoute and sad in my geare. If he be come now for the redempcyon of Man, As I feare he is, I wyll stoppe hym if I can. Hic simulata religione Christum aggreditur. It is a grat joye, by my holydome, to se So vertuouse a lyfe in a yonge man as yow be, As here thus to wander in godly contemplacyon, And to lyve alone in the desart solytarye. Jesus Christus Your pleasure is it to utter your fantasye. Satan Tentator A brother am I of thys desart wyldernesse, And full glad wolde be to talke with yow of goodnesse, If ye wolde accept my symple cumpanye. Jesus Christus I dysdayne nothynge whych is of God trulye. Satan Tentator Than wyll I be bolde a lyttle with yow to walke. Jesus Christus Do so if ye lyst, and your mynde frely talke. Satan Tentator Now forsoth and God, it is joye of your lyfe That ye take soch paynes, and are in vertu so ryfe, Where so small joyes are to recreate the hart. Jesus Christus Here are for pastyme the wylde beastes of the desart, With whom moch better it is to be conversaunt, Than with soch people as are to God repugnaunt. Satan Tentator Ye speake it full well, it is even as ye saye; But tell me how longe ye have bene here, I yow praye. Jesus Christus Fourty dayes and nyghtes, without any sustenaunce. Satan Tentator So moch I judged by your pale countenaunce; Then is it no marvele, I trowe, though ye [be] hungrye. Jesus Christus My stomack declareth the weakenesse of my bodye. Satan Tentator Well, to be pleyne with yow, abroade the rumour doth ronne Amonge the people that ye shuld be Gods sonne. If ye be Gods sonne, as it hath great lykelyhode, Make of these stones breade, and geve your bodye hys fode. Jesus Christus No offence is it to eate whan men be hungrye; But to make stones breade it is unnecessarye. He whych in thys fast hath bene my specyall gyde Fode for my bodye is able to provyde. I thanke my lorde God I am at no soche nede As to make stones breade my bodye so to fede; Whan I come in place where God hath appoynted meate, Gevynge hym hygh thankes, I shall not spare to eate. Satan Tentator Not only for that thys symylytude I brynge, But my purpose is to conclude an other thynge. At the fathers voyce ye toke thys lyfe in hande, Myndynge now to preache as I do understande. In case ye do so, ye shall fynde the offyce harde: My mynde is in thys, ye shuld your body regarde, And not undyscretelye to cast your selfe awaye. Rather take som ease than ye shuld so decaye. I put case ye be Gods sonne: what can that further? Preache ye ones the truth, the byshoppes wyll ye murther; Therfor beleve not the voyce that ye ded heare, Though it came from God, for it is unsavery geare. Beyonde your cumpas rather than ye so ronne, Forsake the offyce and denye yourself Gods sonne. Jesus Christus Ye speake in that poynt very unadvysedlye, For it is written in the eyt of Deutronomye, Man lyveth not by breade or corporall fedynge onlye, But by Gods promyse and by hys scriptures heavenlye. Here ye persuade me to recreate my bodye, And neglect Gods worde whych is great blasphemye. Thys caused Adam from innocencye to fall, And all hys ofsprynge made myserable and mortall. Where as is Gods worde there is both sprete and lyfe, And where that is not death and dampnacyon is ryfe. The strength of Gods worde myghtyly sustayned Moses For fourty dayes space, therof soch is the goodnes. It fortyfyed Helias, it preserved Daniel, And holpe in the desart the chyldren of Israel. Sore plages do folowe where Gods worde is reject, For no persuasyon wyll I therfor neglect That offyce to do whych God hath me commaunded, But in all mekenesse it shall be accomplyshed. Satan Tentator I had rather naye, consyderynge your feblenesse, For ye are but tuly, ye are no stronge persone doughtlesse. Jesus Christus Well, it is not the breade that doth a man upholde, But the lorde of heaven, with hys graces manyfolde. He that Man create is able hym to norysh, And after weakenesse cause hym agayne to florysh. Gods worde is a rule for all that man shuld do, And out of that rule no creature ought to go. He that it foloweth can not out of the waye, In meate nor in drynke in sadnesse nor in playe. Satan Tentator Ye are styfnecked ye wyll folowe no good counsell. Jesus Christus Yes, whan it is soch as the holye scripture tell. Satan Tentator Scriptures I knowe non for I am but an hermyte, I. I maye saye to yow it is no part of our stody; We relygyouse men lyve all in contemplacyon. Scriptures to stodye is not our occupacyon; It longeth to doctours. Howbeyt I maye saye to yow, As blynde are they as we in the understandynge now. Well shall it please ye any farther with me to walke? Though I lyttle profyght, yet doth it me good to talke. Jesus Christus To tarry or go, it is all one to me. Satan Tentator Lete us than wander into the holye cyte Of Hierusalem to se what is there a do. Jesus Christus I shall not saye naye, but am agreable therto. Satan Tentator My purpose is thys: a voyce in your eare ded rynge That ye were Gods sone and welbeloved darlynge, And yow beleve it, but ye are the more unwyse, For to deceyve yow it was some subtyle practyse. Well, upon that voyce ye are geven to perfyghtnesse, Not els regardynge but to lyve in ghostlynesse. Ye watche, fast, and praye, ye shyne in contemplacyon, Leadynge here a lyfe beyonde all estymacyon; No meate wyll ye eate, but lyve by Gods worde onlye, So good are ye wext so perfyght and so holye. I wyll brynge ye, I trowe, to the welle of ghostlynesse, Where I shall fyll ye and glutt ye with holynesse. âWhat, holy?â quoth he. Naye, ye were never so holye As I wyll make ye, if ye folowe hansomlye. [Satan takes Christ to the Temple.] Here is all holy, here is the holy cytie; The holy temple and the holy prestes here be. Ye wyll be holy? Wel, ye shall be above them all, Bycause ye are Gods sonne, it doth ye so befall. Come here, on the pynnacle we wyll be by and by. Jesus Christus What meane ye by that? Shewe fourth your fantasy. Satan Tentator Whan ye were hungrye I ded ye first persuade Of stones to make breade, but ye wolde non of that trade. Ye layed for yourself that scripture wolde not serve it; That was your bucklar, but now I am for ye fyt. For the suggestyon that I now shall to ye laye, I have scripture at hande, ye shall it not denaye. Jesus Christus Kepe it not secrete, but lete it than be hod. Satan Tentator If ye do beleve that ye are the sonne of God, Beleve thys also if ye leape downe here in scoff From thys hygh pynnacle ye can take no harme theroff. And therfor be bolde thys enterpryse to jeoparde: If ye be Gods sonne cast downe your self here backwarde. Jesus Christus Truly that nede not; here is other remedye To the grounde to go, than to fall downe folyshlye. Here are gresynges made to go up and downe therby: What nede I than leape to the earthe presumptuously? Satan Tentator Saye that ye ded it upon a good intent. Jesus Christus That were neyther good nor yet convenyent. Daungers are doubtfull where soch presumpcyon is. Satan Tentator Tush, scripture is with it, ye can not fare amys; For it is written how God hath geven a charge Unto hys Angels that if ye leape at large They shall receyve ye in their handes tenderly, Least ye dashe your fote agaynst a stone therby. If ye do take scath beleve God is not trewe, Nor just of hys worde, and than byd hym adewe. Jesus Christus In no wyse ye ought the scriptures to deprave, But as they lye whole so ought ye them to have. Nomore take ye here than serve for your vayne purpose, Leavynge out the best as ye shuld tryfle or glose. Ye mynde not by thys towardes God to edyfye, But of syncere faythe to corrupt the innocencye. Satan Tentator Whye, is it not true that soch a text there is? Jesus Christus Yes, there is soch a text, but ye wrast it all amys. As the Psalme doth saye God hath commaunded Angels To preserve the just from daungerouse plages and parels. Satan Tentator Well than, I sayd true, and as it lyeth in the text. Jesus Christus Yea, but ye omytted foure wordes whych foloweth next, As âin all thy wayesâ, whych if ye put out of syght, Ye shall never take that place of scripture a ryght. Their wayes are soch rules as God hath them commaunded By hys lyvynge worde, justlye to be observed. If they passe those rules, the Angels are not bounde To be their savegarde, but rather them to confounde. To fall downe backwarde, of a wanton pevyshnes, Is non of those wayes that God ever taught doughtles. Then if I ded it, I shuld tempt God very sore, And deserve to have hys anger evermore. I wyll not so do, for their fathers in the desart Ded so tempt hym ones, and had the hate of hys hart. The clause that ye had maketh for non outwarde workynge, If ye marke the Psalme throughly from hys begynnynge. But what is the cause ye went not fourth with the next verse? Satan Tentator It made not for me; if ye wyll, ye maye it reherse. Jesus Christus Thu shalt, sayth the Psalme, subdue the cruell serpent, And treade undre fote the lyon and dragon pestylent. Satan Tentator No nyghar, I saye, for there ye touche fre holde. Jesus Christus Some love in no wyse to have their rudenesse tolde. To walke in Gods wayes it becometh a mortall man, And therfor I wyll obeye them if I can. For it is written in the sext of Deutronomy: Thu shalt in no wyse tempt God presumptuousely. Satan Tentator What is it to tempt God after your judgement? Jesus Christus To take of hys worde an outwarde experyment Of an ydle brayne, whych God neyther thought nor ment. Satan Tentator What persones do so? Make that more evydent. Jesus Christus All soch as forsake anye grace or remedye Appoynted of God for their owne polycye. As they that do thynke that God shuld fyll their bellye Without their labours, whan hys lawes are contrarye; And they that wyll saye the scripture of God doth slee, They never serchynge therof the veryte. Those also tempt God that vowe presumptuouslye, Not havynge hys gyft to kepe their contynencye, With so manye els as folowe their good intentes, Not grounded on God, nor yet on hys commaundementes; These throwe themselves downe into most depe dampnacyon. Satan Tentator Lyttle good get I by thys communycacyon. Wyll ye walke farther and lete thys pratlynge be? [Satan takes Christ to the mountain.] A mountayne here is whych I wolde yow to se; Trust me and ye wyll, it is a commodyouse thynge. Jesus Christus If it be so good lete us be thydre goynge. Satan Tentator Lo, how saye ye now? Is not here a plesaunt syght? If ye wyll ye maye have here all the worldes delyght: Here is to be seane the kyngedome of Arabye, With all the regyons of Affryck, Europe, and Asye, And their whole delyghtes, their pompe, their magnyfycence, Their ryches, their honour, their welth, their concupyscence. Here is golde and sylver in wonderfull habundaunce, Sylkes, velvetes, tyssues, with wynes and spyces of plesaunce. Here are fayre women, of countenaunce ameable, With all kyndes of meates to the body dylectable. Here are camels, stoute horses, and mules that never wyll tyre; With so many pleasures as your hart can desyre. Jesus Christus Well, he be praysed whych is of them the gever. Satan Tentator Alas it greveth me that ye are soch a belever; Nothynge can I laye but ever ye avoyde me, By the worde of God. Leave that poynt ones I pray ye. If I byd ye make of stones breade for your bodye, Ye saye man lyveth not in temporall feadynge onlye. As I byd ye leape downe from the pynnacle above, Ye wyll not tempt God otherwyse than yow behove. Thus are ye styll poore, thus are ye styll weake and nedye. Jesus Christus And what, suppose ye, wyll that nede remedye? Satan Tentator Forsake the beleve that ye have in Gods worde, That ye are hys sonne, for it is not worth a torde. Is he a father that se hys sonne thus famysh? If ye beleve it I saye ye are to folysh. Ye se these pleasures: if yow be ruled by me I shall make ye a man. To my wordes therfor agre. Loke on these kyngedomes and incomparable treasure; I, the lorde of them, may geve them at my pleasure. Forsake that father whych leaveth the without confort In thys desolacyon, and hens fourth to me resort. Knowledge me for head of thys worlde unyversall, And I wyll make the possessor of them all. Thu shalt no longar be desolate and hungrye, But have all the worlde to do the obsequye. Therfor knele downe here, and worshypp me thys houre, And thu shalt have all with their whole strenth and poure. Jesus Christus Avoyde thu Sathan, thu devyll, thu adversarye! For now thu perswadest most damnable blasphemye. As thu art wycked, so is thy promyse wycked; Not thyne is the worlde, but hys that it created. Thu cannyst not geve it for it is not thyne to geve; Thus dedyst thu corrupt the fayth of Adam and Eve. Thus dedyst thu deceyve both Moses and Aaron, Causynge them to doubt at the lake of contradyccyon. Get the hens, thu fyende and cruell adversarye, For it is written in the tenth of Deutronomye, âGod thu shalt worshypp and magnyfye alone; Holde hym for thy lorde, and make to hym thy mone. He is the true God, he is the lorde of all, Not only of thys but the worlde celestyall.â Thy perswasyon is I shuld not hys worde regarde: A venemouse serpent! Dampnacyon is thy rewarde! Provyde wyll I so that thy kyngedom shall decaye; Gods worde shall be hearde of the worlde, though thu saye naye. Satan Tentator Well than it helpeth not to tarry here any longar; Advauntage to have I se I must go farther. So longe as thu lyvest I am lyke to have no profyght; If all come to passe I maye syt as moch in your lyght. If ye preach Gods worde as me thynke ye do intende, Ere foure years be past I shall yow to your father sende. If Pharysees and Scrybes can do any thynge therto, False prestes and byshoppes with my other servauntes mo, Though I have hynderaunce it wyll be but for a season. I dought not thyne owne herafter wyll worke some treason; Thy vycar at Rome I thynke wyll be my frynde. I defye the, therfor, and take thy wordes but as wynde. He shall me worshypp and have the worlde to rewarde; That thu here forsakest he wyll most hyghlye regarde. Gods worde wyll he treade underneth hys fote for ever, And the hartes of men from the truth therof dyssever. Thy fayth wyll he hate, and slee thy flocke in conclusyon. All thys wyll I worke to do the utter confusyon. Jesus Christus Thy cruell assaultes shall hurt neyther me nor myne, Though we suffer both, by the provydence dyvyne. Soch strength is ours that we wyll have vyctorye Of synne, death and helle, and of the in thy most furye. For God hath promysed that hys shall treade the dragon Underneth their fete, with the fearce roarynge lyon. Hic Angeli accedunt solacium administraturi. Angelus Primus The father of confort and heavenly consolacyon Hath sent us hyther to do our admynystracyon. We come not to helpe, but to do our obsequye, As servauntes becometh, to their lorde and mastre mekelye. If our offyce be to wayte on creatures mortall Why shuld we not serve the mastre and lorde of all? Angelus Alter It is our confort, it is our whole felycyte To do our servyce, and in your presence to be. We have brought ye fode to confort your weake bodye After your great fast and notable vyctorye. Unto all the worlde your byrth we first declared, And now these vytayles we have for yow prepared. Jesus Christus Come nyghar to me. Swete father, thankes to the For these gracyouse gyftes of thy lyberalyte. Hic coram angelis ex appositis comedet. Angelus Primus How meke art thu, lorde, to take that nature on the, Whych is so tendre and full of infyrmyte, As Mannys nature is both feble, faynt, and werye, Weake after laboure, and after fastynge hungrye. Forsoth heaven and earth, yea, helle maye be astoyned The Godhede to se to so frayle nature joyned. Angelus Alter In hys owne he is, for he the worlde first create, Yet semeth the worlde to have hym in great hate. Aboute thirty yeares hath he bene here amonge them, Some tyme in Jewrye, and some tyme in Hierusalem; But fewe to thys daye have done hym reverence, Or as to their lorde shewed their obedyence. Jesus Christus My commynge hyther is for to seke no glorye, But the hygh pleasure and wyll of my father heavenlye. He wyll requyre it at a certayne daye, no dought And shall revenge it, loke they not wele abought. Angelus Primus Plebem alloquitur. The lorde here for yow was borne and circumcysed; For yow here also he was lately baptysed. In the wyldernesse thys lorde for yow hath fasted, And hath overcomen for yow the devyll that tempted; For yow, fryndes, for yow, thys heavenly lorde doth all; Only for your sake he is become man mortall. Angelus Alter Take the shyelde of fayth and lerne to resyst the devyll, After hys teachynges that he do yow non evyll. Full sure shall ye be to have us on your syde If ye be faythfull and holde hym for your gyde. Jesus Christus If they folowe me they shall not walke in darkenes But in the clere lyght, and have felycyte endles; For I am the waye, the lyfe and the veryte, No man maye attayne to the father but by me. Angelus Primus In mannys frayle nature ye have conquerred the enmye, That man over hym shuld alwayes have vyctorye. Angelus Alter Our maner is it most hyghlye to rejoyce Whan Man hath confort, whych we now declare in voyce. Hic dulce canticum coram Christo depromunt. Baleus Prolocutor Lete it not greve yow in thys worlde to be tempted, Consyderynge your lorde and your hygh byshopp Jesus Was here, without synne, in every purpose proved, In all our weakenesse to helpe and socour us, Farthermore to beare with our fragylyte thus. He is unworthye of hym to be a member, That wyll not with hym some persecucyon suffer. The lyfe of Man is a profe or harde temptacyon As Job doth report and Paule confirmeth the same. Busye is the devyll and laboureth hys dampnacyon; Yet have no dyspayre for Christ hath gote the game. Now is it easye hys cruelnesse to tame, For Christes vyctorye is theirs that do beleve; Where fayth take rotynge the devyll can never greve. âResyst,â sayth Peter, âresyst that roarynge lyon,â Not with your fastyngesâ Christ never taught ye soâ But with a stronge fayth withstande hys false suggestyon, And with the scriptures upon hym ever go; Then shall he no harme be able yow to do. Now maye ye be bolde ye have Christ on your syde, So longe as ye have hys veryte for your gyde. What enemyes are they that from the people wyll have The scriptures of God, whych are the myghty weapon That Christ left them here, their sowles from helle to save, And throwe them headlondes into the devyls domynyon. If they be no devyls I saye there are devyls non. They brynge in fastynge but they leave out Scriptum est; Chalke they geve for gold, soch fryndes are they to the Beest. Lete non report us that here we condempne fastynge, For it is not true âwe are of no soch mynde. But thys we covete: that ye do take the thynge For a frute of fayth as it is done in kynde, And onlye Gods worde to subdue the cruell fynde. Folowe Christ alone, for he is the true sheparde; The voyce of straungers do never more regarde. THUS ENDETH THYS BREFE COMEDY CONCERNYNGE THE TEMPTACYON OF JESUS CHRIST IN THE WYLDERNES.
