      <field name="fulltext">âHow much Patience is connected with the Tragic Drama may be illustrated by the statement of Herodotus, that the people of Sicyon represented by actors the Adventures of Adrastus, whom they honoured as a god. Though referring to a period anterior to the existence of dramatic poetry, properly so called, Herodotus denominates these choirs of actors tragic; they represented the Sufferings [?????] of Adrastus.â (M. S.)</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene in Naples, and at Aversa. Time, 14th Century.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. Scene I. âNaples. Regal Closet in Castel-Novo. Andreas (seated) and Fra Roberto, discovered. Andreas. But will it happen? Roberto. Who has said it? Andreas. You! Roberto. An answer! good!âWhat I do prophesy, The saints fulfil. To-morrow, shall the Earthquake Rock Naples, and o'erwhelm her in her sins; Unless, like Nineveh, she first repent. Therefore, this evening, let the multitudes, In long procession, to the churches goâ Women unsandalled, with bewildered hair, Their children in their armsâand cry for mercy; Nor be your Queen exempt, though young and fair. What! will it happen? Wherefore do I crawl, A bald-head, barefoot wretch, attired in rags, Scarce covered, and die daily; if the heavens Should falsify themselves, to cozen me? So lay all gauds asideâ Andreas. That, in my case, Is done already. The Hungarian fashion I still have kept in Naples, and wear here My native garb and manners, at your bidding; Albeit âthe Cataneseâ pronounce them rude And borish; me proclaiming weak and ignorant, Thus swayed by your instruction. Roberto. Let her talk! Best look she to herself! What is she, pri'thee? Andreas. The Countess of Montoniâ Roberto, But what was she? The daughter of a fisherman of Catania, In Sicilyâno more;âwhom chance first made The foster-mother of a prince, and then Court-favor a Court-lady. Impolicy! When democratic insolence rears its front, As now it doth in Rome, constraining even His very Holiness to recognise The authority of its self-christened Tribune, Cola Rienzi! Here in Naples, too, To give the low-born such dominion!âPish! 'Tis to subvert all government at its base, Hereditary Title! Has she power? Let her guard well the magic whence it comes, Or, with my counter-charms, her spells may sicken! Andreas. Yet with her Father still you correspond? Roberto. For my own endsâor, rather, those of justice. Saints may consort with sinners for high ends; Ends consecrate all means. Even now, good Andreas! The Old Man from Catania hath arrived, That he, by counsel and by skill, may save The City and his Child, . . . or perish with them. Andreas. 'Tis a strange notion. Poor old man! Here comes The Countessâ Roberto. Yesâat length! Enter Philippa. Philippa. Your Majesty Sent for meâ Andreas. Yes. We must needs rule, it seems, Through you; nay, even, when divinest mercy Should be by right implored, must supplicate Your intercession with our gracious Queen, To mediate with God for us and Naples, Against the threatened judgement. Roberto. Potent lady! You must divest you of those princely robes, Those courtly ornaments, those signs of rank, Not native to you; these must be put off; And you, and such as you,âhereditaries, Or upstarts,âequal both in heaven's just eye,â Must forth, in rags,âlike mine,âand pay your vows, Where'er the clement Virgin boasts a shrine. Philippa. Were you as clement as the Virgin, friar! Less bitter had your adjuration been. 'Twere better you would learn, our manners here Befit the gentle clime, even as the vine, The cedar, and the citron, do the soil; And songs and gondoliers the twilight sea. But to my duty. Know, her majesty Bids me acquaint you, that she hath already Made preparation for devout procession, Commanding my attendance. Roberto. By your advice? âWhich ever would anticipate my own! Philippa. Anticipate? Roberto. Yesâ'tis your policyâ Philippa. Honesty is my only policy. Roberto. The policy of heretics it is, Who have no consecration but their virtue, Which, till the Church confirm it, is worse evil! Howbeit, not always have you thus advantageâ I am beforehand with you! Philippa. How? Roberto. Your father! Philippa. Stop! Has the sum of years he was to breathe, Been numbered? No! Then God be thanked!âBut why Should I ask you? Where is my messenger? Who should, before you could, have told me all? Roberto. A brother of my orderâGeronimoâ Philippa. Ayâhe! By him full many a time have I Sent gifts and greeting, still disdained and spurned. Poor would my father be, nor feed my pride, By recognition of my state and power. Roberto. Yes! power abused to ends that ruin Naples, And wake the wrath of heaven! Philippa. 'Tis false, base monk! But now, what of my father? Roberto. By this, he has Arrived in Naples. I depart to meet him. Since guilt like yours brings vengeance on the city, He hopes that, if the earthquake will receive him, His voluntary death may expiate, Both the transgression, and the punishment. (Exit.) Philippa. Go, intermeddling and fanatic monkâ Andreas (interrupting her). You'll wait upon us to her majestyâ Philippa (not heeding him). Thou hast abused thy opportunity, And, therewithal, a father's ear and heart! 'Tis well! now face to face, I nothing fear; For not illiterate, nor rude of mind, Though poor, I learned of him what has sufficed To raise me to a rankâ Andreas. Will you wait on us?â Philippa. My royal lord! your pardon!â Andreas. To the Queen! [Exeunt. Scene II. âExterior of the Castel-Novo. (Churches, Terraces, Gardens, Citrons, and Cedars.) Enter Roberto, Geronimo, and Salvator. Salvator. Since you must go, farewell! receive my thanks For having brought me hither. Fare you well. Geronimo. Roberto's care will serve. [Exit. Salvator. 'Tis well!âProceed. Roberto. As I was saying, while we came along, Doubtless the Church has much authority, And, for the exercise of magic art, Might make example of her; but, Salvator, Because she is your daughter, and you have been A true son of the faith, we fain would spare herâ Salvator. I am beholden to you. Roberto. Yet 'tis hard To shew forbearance in so plain a case, When all in Naples know, her sway at Court Hath been by witchcraft wonâBut she's your daughter. Dissension between states is of her causing. Maria, the Queen's sister, should have wedded Louis of Hungary, the King's elder brother; When, lo, she plots Durazzo's marriage with her, Whence Hungary and Naples are at strife; Which, 'stead of healing, she persuades the Queen To tastes and customs alien from the King's, Whence those of the two kingdoms, in our streets, Brawl nightly on their quarrel; these affecting Our northern manly manners, those the soft Luxuriance taught us by the poets now, Petrarca, Dante, and Boccaccio. Salvator. There is the girl, my own! I taught her song! Good friar, be not harsh; but spare the Poet, Who seldom hath his guerdon till he dies. The Sun's a Poet, and his poetry The stars of heaven, that shine when he is absent: So live men's verses best when they are dead, Gilding the night of time. 'Tis joy at eve, To the Sicilian fisherman, to hear His wife sing from the shore, and to respond Far out amidst the waters. See! who comes? Enter Duke and Duchess Durazzo, with Men, Women, and Monks, barefoot, &amp;c., in procession, chanting a hymn. Roberto. That is Durazzo's Duke, I told you of; The Princess that, Maria, with her maidens; And their retainers; in religious state, Seeking the Virgin's altars. Salvator. To the soul, Priceless as water, vital as the air, Is piety. The mercy it brings down, From the encircling heavens, absolve this land Of every curse she merits! Duke. Stay, awhile, Our ceremonial walk: I would repay This strange but solemn greeting. Art thou he, (I know thou art,) the Countess' aged sire, Of whom but now she spake? Salvator. Does she draw nigh? Duke. She does; with such profound humility, As, were she the magician he reports, Would, from a witch, translate her to a saint, Or moreâa blessed martyr. Salvator. Welcome news! Repentance changes Heaven as well as Man: Methought, she were not lapsed beyond all hope! No soul so lost, repentance may not find: Good sleeps in all. The meanest, grossest clod Is a bright splendor, but outshone by others; And, fitly wrought, may far outshine the brightest! âWhere is my daughter? I'll go meet her. [Exit. Duke. Friar! You are well and holily employed, in lying 'Gainst the Queen's friendsâ Roberto. Your highness might be better, Than railing 'gainst the King'sâ Duke. Base Monk of Hungary! Roberto. Smooth Prince of Naples! Duke. Fall we into rankâ Salvator is returning. Re-enter Salvator. Salvator. Here I'll wait Philippa. Scarce I know her, such the change So many years have made in her and me. Duke. She follows in the troop that now approaches. Enter Philippa, the Count Evoli, Lady Sancha, Count Terlizi, Giulio, and others, in procession, chanting, &amp;c. That is her son, the Count Evoli, leads; Her beautiful grand-daughter, Sancha, next; And then her husband, Count Terliziâ Salvator. Why, I'm founder of a noble family! The peasant father of a line of princes! Hath witchcraft done this? Look, Philippa, here! That I may know my child! Philippa. Salvator! father! Roberto. Embrace her not! Avoid the sorceress! Avoid the Scarlet Horror! Salvator. Gently, monk! Nay! give me leave.âWhen Nineveh repented, Jonah was wroth. Her penitence, perhaps, May save, by good example, Naples too! Stand not 'tween me and her! These tears enough Blind me, without you! Roberto (aside). Softness will spoil allâ I meant that he should challenge her in the street Of witchcraft, that the populace might be raised With passionate exhibition. Would the earth, Now gaping, whelmed them both! Philippa. An age ago You were my fatherâere you made a vow Still with your poverty to shame my pride. Am I now proud? Nor has it been by pride, That I have flattered power into my keeping. But hypocrites, who have your conscience' key, Have still your credulous ears corrupted, telling Of bad ambition, by unearthly means, Charming dominion, like a falcon, down, My wrist to grace; that never, by such means, Not even in desire, was lured thereto. Thine honorable heart has been deceivedâ But now with us in these devotions join, And from their majesties themselves shall you Hear and judge my demerits. Salvator. Be it so! Philippa. We meet the Royal Couple at the Bay, Whereat three galleys have arrived from Cyprus, Three others anchored there already; also, One with four hundred galley-slaves on board. We fear for them, if come the stormy wrath! But never was there a serener sky, Than, on this dreaded eve, laughs over Naples, With promise of a glad rejoicing morrow. [Exeunt. Scene III. âThe Bay of Naples, with several Galleys in Harbour, by moonlight. Rock of Sant' Elmo, Fortress, and Cathedral. Anxious Groups: among them, the Carpenter at his bench, the Shoemaker with his tools, the Maccaroni dealer at his stall, and the Lazzare with his basket; also Beppo, Ghino, and Zeppa. Crowds, likewise, walking in different directions. Hungarians and Neapolitans. Song. Wife, on the beach, looking towards a Boatman on the water, in the extreme distance. She. Fisher! speed! the Heavens are fair! Speed, fisher, speed! He. Calm the waters! clear as fair! Speed, fisher, speed! She. Cast into the waves thy net! Speed, fisher, speed! He. Rich the sport! Sing to me yet, Speed, fisher, speed! Both. Speed, fisher, speed! Beppo. See you what number of Hungarian habits Shame the passeggio? Ghino. Let come the earthquakeâ I'd benefit by the tumult, and would rid Our Naples of a fewâ Zeppa. The Chancellor! A better time will come to strike for freedom! [They retire. Enter Hugh del Balzo, Talano, and Bruno. Balzo. What said the Lazzari? Keep watch upon them! Not very likely, in so fair a night, Earthquake should threatenâ Talano. What should dream it, But a monk's addled brain, gone mad upon Astrology? Balzo. It is but nine days' since We had a shock, though slight: they do not use To come so soon. Bruno. It is an idle terror! Here hastes Geronimo, Roberto's brotherâ Balzo. His spy!âmore rude and obstinate in mind, And more uncivil in his speech, withal; As dull, and yet as sharp, in his retorts, As shot poured back from the unflashing rock! Enter Geronimo. What now, good Friar? Geronimo. How then, wise Chancellor? Balzo. Have you just left their Majesties' retinue? Geronimo. You see I have.âI am their messenger. The Queen has risen from Sant' Elmo's altar, And hither with her train expects your duty. Though barefoot, and in rags of penitence, Though humbled before heaven, yet Majesty Needs service still on earth from mortal man. Balzo. We are in waiting on their Majesties. Enter (descending by Sant' Elmo's rock) the Queen (Giovanna), Andreas, and numerous Attendants; followed by the Duke and Duchess Durazzo, and Philippa, Salvator, Roberto, and their respective Trains. Queen. Balzo, our trusty Chancellor. Balzo. I attend Your pleasure; touched, by the humility Which now your royal person undergoes, To wonder, that would worship you, as you The Virgin, with profound devotedness. Philippa (after a pause). Balzo! the silence of our royal mistress Rebukes this adulation. And your ear Is needed now, while truth from clouds of time Emerges, and grows audible, long mute. Balzo. Speak not in riddlesâ Philippa. Let my Father speak, As speak the poor, right out. Balzo. Produce himâ Philippa. Hereâ Queen. We would that of his witness you be audientâ Since it the powerful doth implicate. Say now, Salvator! what you have to say. Salvator. Pardon me, lady! if, in royal presence, I should demean me with too bold a speech. Queen. Speak freely on, as to a fellow-creature: We all are equal in a time like thisâ Salvator. Taught by my parents to respect the Church, My mind grew up in Catholic belief, Referring all I knew to law divine; Whence I was curious in the lives of Saints, Of Anchorites, and other holy men, And learned from them, and such discourse as theirs, To value their Religious Poverty; But, prizing still the freedom of my life, Desired to make, and keep, the Vow they took, Without forsaking worldly business. This did I formally, at earliest manhood, In secret to a priest; nor boasting made, But cherished it in conscience as my law. Philippa. Not then to shame my pride, to mock my state; But simply as a fore-appointed rule Of temperance, the vow, whereof they spake, By thee was perseveringly maintained, 'Gainst the temptations I assailed it with? Salvator. No more, Philippa! 'twas their treasonous falsehood, Which late I have detected. Look! that monk, Geronimo, from you so often sent To my Catanian dwelling, nine days since, Came there, and broached the suit, which findeth me In Naples now. Queen. Stand forth, Geronimo!â Go on, Salvator! with thy tale; it pleases. Salvator. Thus I obey your Majesty's commands. This monk, as I have said, did visit me, 'Gainst her still pleading witchcraft and ambition, Pride and oppression, mainly of the poor! Philippa. O God! O God!â Queen. Be calm, Montoni!âWell? Salvator. And roused my anger to a towering pitch: Then of Roberto's prophecy he spakeâ âCome,â said he, âand serve now the cause of God, Of the poor, and of the Churchâthe time is come! With me to Naples, while the popular mind Seethes in the ferment that increases daily, And charge her, though your daughter, (for what reck Relationships of earth, when Heaven demands The sacrifice of every natural feeling, For interests that the world itself transcend?) And charge her publicly with public guilt; Then, in the tumult of the storm thereafter, (For it will surely come,) we will enflame The passions of the multitude, incite Revolt, set free the slaves on board the galley, To' enhance confusion; in the midst whereof, The Queen, the Countess, and their partisans, Being seized, may be deposed, and, with acclaim, Andreas pronounced sole monarch!â Queen. Speak, my Andreas! What dreadful part had you in this dark plot? Andreas. None, royal wife! Or else the old man lies, Or else the monk spake from himself alone! Salvator. I lie not, sir! Ask him! Roberto. Nay, ask not himâ He nothing says, unless you first concede, His order vouches him incapable Of wrong in word or act. Queen. That were to grant What would preclude enquiryâ Salvator. Which not now May be pursued. Even now the Earthquake hastes! Look not incredulousâfor it is true! The starry proofs, which well as he I know, Trust me, prohibit hope!âWhile we discourse, Lo, the serene and lovely midnight sky Is shadowed, and the wan and westering moon Doth hide herself behind St. Martin's mount, Her face much darkened, partly veiled with clouds! Big pattering drops prelude the impatient storm! Stand still, and listen! Know ye not the sounds Precede the crash?âIt comes! (Loud rumbling noise.) The Earth is shaken! [Loud thunder. All the groups are startledâtheir furniture of trade, &amp;c., overthrown. Many cast themselves on the ground. Roberto. Forth to the churches! fall before the Virgin! Queen. Away! away! Stay not behind, Montoni! Philippa. Who would take shelter now, when even the buildings, We seek to shield, may topple down, and crush us? âI follow, royal mistress! One word only, First, with Salvator! Queen. As you will! Lead on!â [Exeunt omnes, except Salvator, Philippa, Evoli, Sancha, Terlizi.âThunder. Philippa. Even midst this tumult of the elements, Let calm dwell in the temple of our souls! And now a solemn hush comes o'er them, too; 'Tis thus they teach us peace, even in their angers! My husband and my children! this is he, Whose wisdom, I so frequently have said, Built up the mind within me, being thus A double parent to me. (To Salvator.) See your grandchild! Her name is Sancha, after the fair Queen Of good King Robert, in whose grace I grew. (The stillness seems to deepenâthough it darkens; The hovering rain-clouds gather thick and fast!) What say you, Sancha! to our noble sire? Revere him as a memory changed to hopeâ Our ancestor, uprisen from the grave Of a past generation! Sancha. I'll worship him as The Father of my fathers! Philippa. To his arms, And let him feel himself, he is such indeed! Salvator. The founder of a race! O, wicked monks! Whom their own wickedness deceived! translating My words into their meaning! Philippa. What words! Father! The storm abates, and I can listen! Salvator. Thus Said I, after Geronimo had finished: âSuch storm, such earthquake, will, indeed, shake Naples To her foundationsâI will go with you, And, if the earth should open with the shock, Will plunge myself into the gulf, like Curtius; For, haply, heaven may pardon, for the sake Of such a martyrdom, both the guilty city, And they who rule her; most of all, Philippa: Or should they perish, I will perish too!â [Thunder. Philippa. Mercy of heaven! Earth shakes againâ'tis past! Thou hast saved Naples, father! but not me. This act of thine brings discontent to head; Henceforth, my foes are enemies indeed; And I, or they, must perish in the sequel. But that confide we to the saints! [Storm, which increases. Salvator. Say you? Philippa. Peaceâpeace! [Rainâwindâlightningâthunder, &amp;c. Salvator. No peace! The storm is up! Heavens! what a storm! Philippa. Let's seek the Queenâ Salvator. Go you, and seek her straightâ I've work elsewhere! Believe me! No delay! Trust in my wisdom! Quick! Which is the galley That holds the slaves? Philippa. Thatâthat! Salvator. EnoughâGoâQuickâ Farewell! Philippa. Farewell!âand let us say for ever! For we may never meet again! Salvator. We shall! But, ne'ertheless, farewellâas if for ever! [Exeunt omnes, except Salvator. Salvator (alone). That hold of galley-slaves! They're tampering there! What I have said is little, if I let Them do their work. Upon that galley's deck My foot must treadâmy presence must be there! The wayâthe way? Be Providence my guide! An old man's life like mine is little risk; Yet guard it, heaven! for the city's sake! [Exit. Violent Storm, and convulsion of the Sea in the Bay. It becomes quite dark. Enter Roberto and Andreas. Andreas. Roberto! where art thou? It darkens strangely! Roberto. Here! take my hand! What! fearest thou? O, let A royal soul inform a royal bosom! Andreas. The dread contention of the elements Is universalâ Roberto. Nothing less than this: A terrible conspiracy of all The Mediterranean, and the Adriatic, With earth and heaven! Andreas. Conspiracyâmost clearâ Divulgedâas ours! Without, within, is storm, And earthquake, ruin, horror, and remorse! I am myself the mere wreck of a King! Roberto. Of a Queen's husbandâyet to be a King! If policy and courage but cohere! The ruin is a Chrysalid, wherefrom The entombÃ«d Sylph emerges, winged and crownedâ Even so the statue's in the block contained, But needs the Sculptor's hand to set it freeâ And such be mine! [Storm continues. Andreas (vehemently.) Tempt me no more!â Roberto (surprised and troubled). How now? Andreas (disregarding him). What water floods! what wind! and, hark! what thunder! What fearful rumbling in the heavens above us! What horrible tremblings in the earth we stand on! What vehement commotions in the sea! What shrieks of the amazed, distracted throng! The darkness deepens! Roberto. Where left you the Queen? Andreas. Before the altar; with the priests at mass, New-robÃ«d for its celebration, Stretched on the ground in supplicating prayer; While her attendants, and the multitude, Prostrate in fear,â Roberto. Ha! had Salvator stood The putting-on, there 'mong them, even now, I would have rushed, and, with deep-tonÃ«d voice, In strain prophetic, called upon the crowd, To rise in mad revolt! Andreas. Obtuse the Monk, Thus to mistake the letter for the spirit, In what the old man said! Roberto. What! if he should, Obedient to mere orders, without wit To understand that what has happened since Revokes them, be involving us more deeply? Where is he? Enter Geronimo. Geronimo. Ho! Roberto! Andreas! Andreas. There! Roberto. (Storm.) His voice! How the earth reels! I'll answer him! Geronimo! Geronimo. Here! Stand you where you areâ [Gropes about, and comes forward. I've found you!â Roberto. (Storm.) Earth is reeling! You are stedfast? Geronimo. At least, not easily movedâYet have I been! Roberto. When? Geronimo. Just now! Roberto. Speak! Geronimo. Salvator is aboard The galley' among the slavesâthe maddened slaves! Andreas. Urging rebellion in his daughter's favour? Geronimo. No; I was there, according to instructionsâ Roberto. Fool! dolt!âBut he?â(Storm.) Till this shock passes, pause!â Now speak, Geronimo!â Geronimo. How Salvator got On board I know not; but he trod the deck, Likest an ancient god, or risen saint. His name was known, even there, in that sea-prison (So fast same travels when ill-luck is busy); And when he said, âI am Salvator!â they Shouted aloud, and, at his word, enforced My absence with a zeal, had been my death, But for his softeningâ [Storm. Roberto. Felt you not that shock? Earth's drunken with heaven's anger! Well! no more? Did the world reel, you were insensible! Geronimo. I reached the port, but strangely! There amidst, Were scattered on the sea, and for the shore Struggling, wave-battered, countless crowds of wretches, The storm had dashed like shells against the beach, Covered already with the drowned, half-drowned, With fractured skulls, with limbs and limbless bodies. The sands, whereon we wont to walk, boil up! Messina's faro or Charybdis' whirlpool, Are spots of safety to them!âSee, those torches At yonder horn of the Bay! A thousand or more Of Neapolitan nobility, Mounted on horseback, have assembled there, To solemnise their country's obsequies. The Queen and retinue in sacred silence, This way return. Behold! [Storm. Re-enter Queen, Philippa, and processionsâwith lighted torches. Philippa. Where is the monk? O Night! O Naples! Miracle, and Doom! Not swart nor azure, as in common storms, The billows roll, like tumbling hills of snow, In ghastly whiteness through the grave of space! The sea begins to undermine the ground: They say, 'twill soon explode beneath our feet! Where is the monk? Geronimo. I stand before you now. Philippa. Said you, Salvator boarded the slave-galley? Geronimo. I did. Philippa. O, gracious God! no vessel may resist The gale! Send torches up Sant' Elmo's rock! See how the galleys toss, and rise, and sinkâ O, heaven and earth! for pity!â'tis in vain! Three have gone down at once for ever! Which Were they? Geronimo. The Cyprianâ Philippa. Fool to forget it! The others are in harbour. Thereâthey heave Against each other! Now they strike, and strikeâ And they do sinkâand all on board do perish! Only the slave-ship lives! Spare that, O God! O God! [Meanwhile, the rock becomes covered with torchlit groups; and a loud peal of music from the organ in Sant' Elmo cleaves the noise of the storm. Curtain falls.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. Scene I. âAversa. Interior of the Celestine Monastery. Enter Terlizi, Evoli, and Balzo. Terlizi. God's Virtue, man! I say, it was a wonder Vesuvius kept his temper, such an Earthquake Fretting his roots; and Naples were not buried In burning lava. Little I thought that ever We should the city quit; yet here are we, In the Celestine Monastery at Aversaâ Evoli. Good fifteen miles away from Naples, Count! Furthest the best from perilous place and time, The death and ruinâ Balzo. Falling where they did! Good honest people suffered. Those six galleys, That sank in sight with all that they contained, A lawful crew and cargo! The slave galley, Crowded with convicts, triumphed o'er the tempest, Though Providence had saved the state some charge, By summary drowningâ Terlizi. Heaven forfend, good sirâ Not while Salvator was on board, I trust: 'Twas for his sake the vessel was preserved! Enter Giulio. How come you now, young Giulio? Giulio. A newsbearer. From the exhaustion of that dreadful night, And from the couch it long time doomed him to, Salvator has arisen, much restored. Terlizi. Has he left Naples? Giulio. Yesâand will come hither. He is preceded by Durazzo's Duke, And the Princess Maria, whom I met, And parted from in haste, to'inform you of it. Terlizi. This news will glad my wife, thrown out of cheer By politic necessity, which made Her tendance here upon their Majesties A paramount regard. Her dimned eye Will kindle with renewed intelligence, When once more it beholds him. Enter Duke and Duchess of Durazzo. Duke. We would hail you, In this religious refuge. Well, we hope The pre-appointments for the coronation Of our good Queen, are happily accomplished. Terlizi. Why not the King? Duke. Crowned he will be of course, Being her husband. Would 'twere otherwise! For me, I feel no life within my soul, While blood is in his veins! Geronimo (within.) Pax vobis! benedicite! Duke. A voice I hate to hear! Enter Geronimo. Geronimo. Will none reply, And greet my âbenediciteâ with welcome? Duke. Your presence would denote the Countess' father Is not far distantâ Balzo. There is stir within, As if the Countess had had notice tooâ Duke. Pri'thee, see to it. Balzo. Willingly. [Exit Balzo. Terlizi. How is it with Salvator? Duke. Somewhat wroth, The Countess should have left him, with the Court, After such service; nor would he have followed, But his grand-daughter, Sancha, has most strangely Won on his fancyâ Re-enter Balzo. Balzo. 'Tis Roberto entered, And has had speech with Andreasâ Duke. Whereat, what?â Balzo. The Countess raised a cry of âTreason!âBut They comeâand, in alarm, the Queen! Enter Queen, Philippa, Sancha, Roberto, Andreas, and Attendants. Duke. Heaven guard Your Majesty with loyal zeal and wisdom, With lynx-eyed vigilance, such as still attends In person of your angel. Queen. Thank you, Dukeâ Yet nothing say in hatred 'gainst my lord. Duke. Nothing, if nothing for himself he saysâ He's silent. Queen. Scorning answer. He has right To speak to whom he will, with whom he will Be silent. Duke. Please your Majestyâ Queen. I'm not pleasedâ I know not whether to be pleased or vexed! Sister, Maria! come with me apart! [They withdraw and converse. Duke. What shout was that? Evoli. Salvator has arrived In sight, my lord! The poor without the gates Look on him as their saint, and thus announce him. Duke. Even so?â'Tis well! Now then, you plotting monks, The Lazzari, if things but keep their train, May grow to be to you as you to us; As troublesome to Naples, as the dogs At night are to Constantinople! Roberto. Shrewd And travelled duke! you're merry! Duke (to Philippa.) Countess! comeâ(They converse apart.) Ye pair of curs! (To Roberto and Geronimo.) the bone of strife ye covet, Snarl o'er together! Roberto. Duke! most merry Duke! Look well, lest magic prove no laughing matter! A viperous generation! Wizard, both Abuse the sense! He saves the lives of wretches From drowning, by his presence! She with hers Usurps authority, and makes Queens her puppets! Queen. Irreverend monk! beware! or I will show you, I am a Queen, indeed! Of all men, thou, At least, shalt know it! Philippa. Madam, silent scorn Befits him best; he may be left to perish Of his convicted guilt! Roberto. Rail on! words kill not, Save when by pious lips they're rightly uttered! Duke. Thine? Roberto. Mine! that have already prophesiedâ Beware, lest now they speak anathema! Ye laughâfrom ribald scorners, I appeal To royal Andreas. He will silence break, In my behoof. Andreas. No! for thy blasting! Thou, Insidious friar! hast sown dissention 'twixt My Queen and me! As on a serpent's head, I place my heel on thineâ Robeto. If this were true, Thine heel were wounded; I but fondle it, Albeit, ingrate, with unreturned caresses. Andreas. Henceforth, thou'rt as a scorpion in my mind; And what seemed pious in thee, now appears But as the pitiablest ruin, like The perished beauty on a harlot's cheek! Queen. Monk! thou hast had thine answer. We forgive Thy former insolence and infamy: Live to repentâbut be it far from us, In convent, cell, or desart hermitage, As best may medicine thy soul's disease. (To Philippa.) My best adviser, counsellor, and friend, Dear Countess! fret no more, because of him; But rule for us, in Naples! [They all withdraw, and converse in groups, leaving Roberto and Geronimo in front. Roberto. Mark them, brother! They do conspire together! Mark you well, That Andreas stands apart! Look! do you note it? Geronimo. (taking out a Table-Book). Ay, and have writ it down. Roberto. 'Tis wellâ'tis well! Plain, he knows not what they commune aboutâ Neither does Hugh del Balzo. Leave me now For Balzo, brother; whisper in his ear, To note it too. Geronimo. I will. [Goes up to Balzo, and converses with him apart. Shouts, without. Roberto. Salvator comes: The Lazzari shout again. Duke. 'Tis so, indeed. Philippa. Let me be first to meet him! Queen. Nay, 'twere seemly, That ye should meet alone. All else withdraw. Come, princes; follow us! Philippa. Sancha! stay with me! [Exeunt omnes, except Philippa and Sancha. Enter Salvator, followed by Beppo, Ghino, and Zeppa. Salvator. No further, friends! I must be private now! I thank you! Let me pray, that you will leave me. Beppo. You are our saint; it is for us to pray. Ghino. Pray you for us! Zeppa. Our prayers we leave with you! [Exeunt. Salvator. Bring me a chair. Sancha. Here, sir. Salvator (sits.) What! you, fair grandchild! [embracing Sancha, who kneels.) Still constant! you, who stayed behind, when all Besides abandoned me, then summoned you Away from my sick couch! Still have you lived At my heart's core; ay, snugly lodged, as dreams are 'Twixt the eyelids and the eyes! Philippa. 'Twas not my will That called me from you; duty to the Queen And state of Naplesâ Salvator. O, my old brain is weary, I cannot argueâ Philippa. If I have transgressed, I'll kneelâ Salvator (still seated). Noânot to me! Thou art a Countess! What, though I'm honest, I am poor, my lady; Though old, not overwise; experience, merged In senile weakness and oblivious ageâ I've done with action; it is time I should! One only wish I had, and that's fulfilledâ To clasp, (to Sancha,) fair child! thy neck as now I do, And see my daughter in thee, as she was In days long past;âthose I could understand, Of these I'm ignorant. Now I know her not! Philippa. If ever I intended slight to theeâ If aught less than my service to my country Compelled the voice of nature to be silent, Then let the Father of us all discard me! Salvator. Yet Nature is than service elder far! Perchance, a reason good for its neglect! Philippa. No! by the sacred honor of my soul! No! by the God that I have worshiped always! Salvator. Thou sayest well; and, doubtless, meanest well! All spiritual elevations triumph over The natural feeling, or transfigure it Into a glorious likeness of themselves. I know thou meanest well! I know thy goodness! Philippa. Thou dost? I thank the saints! Salvator. The wrong thou'st done, Is custom's wrong, not thineâ Philippa. Why? Salvator. How blind Are we to truth! or if we apprehend it, Do so with singular inversion, such As the desart snow-storm soaring with the sands, Not coming from the clouds. Look thou to Heaven, Not grope below, for Truth! Philippa. I'll look to theeâ Be thou Heaven's image to me! Salvator. Listen, then. Had I been rich and noble, and had shown The knowledge and the promptitude to act, Wherewith, in her emergency, I saved The peace of Naples;âthen had the feat been lauded In courtly ears, which o'er my lips had leaned To catch their whisper as an oracleâ Then (though you may deceive yourselves, to think Now otherwise) had both the Queen and you My counsel sought, ere you removed from Naples. And if ye hadâ Philippa. What, if we had? Salvator. You said, What I had done, had saved the City, but Had perilled you. Such peril, haply, I Might have averted, if forsaken not. Others forsook me not! Those treacherous monks Left not my couch a moment; made themselves Still seem my friends, and to the poor and humble, The Lazzari of Naples, blazoned me, As if I were their tutelary saint, Their guardian-angel; and therewith prevailed, That even my disclaimer only wrought On their belief the more! Philippa. What comes of this? Salvator. I know not, save the need of vigilance; Which now I cannot give! Sancha. Look! he is ill Again. How pale his brow! how cold his hand! O, Countess! call for help! Philippa. Ourselves will help him. We know not who are traitors.âO, Salvator! Would I had ne'er been otherwise than poor! Humble, and mean of rank! Sancha. Ha! he revivesâ His colour comesâhe warmsâ Philippa. If he can walk, We'll lead him to his couch. He hears me. Can You rise, my Father? Speak! Salvator. Ay, daughter. Philippa. Wellâ But gentlyâlean on me. Your Sancha's arms Are round you too. Ah, now you smileâand make Me happy. There's a couch in the next chamber! [They lead him out. Scene II. âGarden of the Monastery. Enter Roberto. Roberto. Hurled from the seat of power, like Lucifer, My soul is wild as Chaos, wroth as Hell, And claims that vengeance which belongs to Heaven, As Heaven's vicegerent! Sure and speedy vengeance! A word for thunder, but the lightning's flash, While it is speaking, strikeâif not before! Ungrateful cur! thou'st not another day, Andreas! to live! Now, but to fix the guilt Of his off-taking on my other foes, To make the murder sweeter. Glorious vengeance! Most instant vengeance! ere the eye can wink, Function respire, or intellection think!â How now, Geronimo? Enter Geronimo. Have you wrought up The Lazzari to our purpose? Geronimo. Be at ease: I have a knot of fellows, who believe, In taking Andreas' life, they rid the Queen Of a loathed burthen, and the Poor Man's Friend Of an implacable and powerful foe. Roberto. Here comes Durazzo! I must play the fawner, And catch him in the meshes of our net. Hypocrisy alone can veil our treason! Go to your taskâhow shall I know your man? Geronimo. A Courier from Naples is the part He playsâ Roberto. Is he well up? Geronimo. Depend upon it. [Exit. Enter Duke of Durazzo. Duke. How fares it with you now, Roberto? Roberto. Better Than everâ Duke. So! Indeed? Roberto. Adversity Is, to the soul that's pious, wholesomer Than prosperous fortune to the wicked heart. Duke. A veritable saw. Then need to you Is kinder than much wealth to Andreas. Roberto. The ungrateful ever is a mendicant. Duke. Another truth! Would'st be revenged? Roberto. On whom? Duke. On Andreasâ Roberto. Not I, sir! Duke. Wouldst be reconciled? Roberto. NeitherâI leave the issues in High hands! Duke. Neither restored to favor, nor revenged? I took you for a worse or wiser manâ Good-bye! [Exit. Roberto. Aha! Durazzo's hatred To Andreas, seething long, boils over now! He seeks the toils, and runs upon the springe! He would conspireâwith me. He shall conspireâ But not with me! It is about the hour, When that the seneschal and his household come, For recreation, to these convent-gardens; Doubtless, Durazzo, too, will walk with them. âHe never hath concealed his enmity, Which makes him level lie to artifice, And what just now he said to me commits him. Out of my motive for like enmity, Hopes and designs they fancy and create, Which do as surely lead them to their ruin, As the wanton's steps to death! Re-enter Duke of Durazzo, with Terlizi, Evoli, and Giulio. Duke. Here still, Roberto? Roberto. I am at prayersâfor my enemies. Terlizi. A pious exerciseâbut who are they? Roberto. Ye were; but now, ye think, we row together In the same vessel 'gainst a common foe. Duke. Think? Is't not so? Roberto. Whyâyesâif so ye thinkâ Ye worldly men let the conceit grow on you, That all that saints must needs account poor shadow Is life's substantial pith. Still live to think so! Duke. And you to pray? Terlizi. And not to eat? or drink? âOr sleep? Roberto. Yes, on our injuries!â'Tis best! Our dreams are shrewder than our waking thoughts, And hint a braver vengeanceâ Duke. Hear you? (to Terlizi.) Roberto (aside). They Are caught! Are ye the men would read the Sphinx? Duke. If you are honest, I would have you speak As man, and not as priest. What mystery? If you've an interest in saying, âNoââ And yet say, âYes;â what wonder it should be With such an inverse emphasis, that wholly Wanting the force of âYes;â it nothing lacks In the effect of âNoâ!â Roberto. Now, you have said!â Enter Geronimo. What would you here? Geronimo. A Courier from Naples Waits on Durazzoâ Duke. Strange! Without? Alone? Geronimo. No; there are two or three attend with him! [Exit Duke of Durazzo. Terlizi. What news can come from Naples to the Duke? Roberto. Methinks, he half-expected it; for, lo, He meets it half wayâand in secret, too! I here protest me, before Heaven, I like not Such latent practice! Terlizi. Practice? Tush, there's noneâ Roberto. If't be, I'm quit on'tâ Re-enter Duke of Durazzo, with Courier, and two others. (Beppo, Ghino, and Zeppa, so disguised.) Duke. You are mistaken, friar; They want the royal Andreas, and not me. They have despatches for him. That's your wayâ That gallery leads to the Queen's apartment; His chamberlain will bring you to her consort. [Exeunt Courier and Companions Roberto. You plot it well! Duke. I do not understand youâ Roberto. Then you're as much a mystery to yourself, As I am to you. Truly, you are strangeâ One knows not what to make of youâ Terlizi. You're mad! [Turning away indignantly. Roberto. Indeed!â(to Geronimo.) Your Table-book! Hast writ it down? Geronimo. Look here, yourself! Roberto. Enoughâaway! [Exit Geronimo. [Shrieks heard from the Monastery. Cries of âHelp! Murder! Help!â Ah! cries Of âHelp!â and âMurder!â Who were they, Durazzo, You showed to royal Andreas? Duke. Search the gallery! [As he is going off in the direction taken by the pretended Couriers, Philippa meets him. Philippa. Wonder and horror! Stop the Assassins! Andreas Is murdered! Duke. Let me pass! [Hurries out. Philippa. Celestial Watchers! And do ye wink at this? or have ye slept? All-knowing Powers! if ye would have us trust you, Divulgeâo'ertake the Traitor! Re-enter Duke of Durazzo. Roberto. See him there!â Thou'st now thy wish, Durazzo! Duke (drawing). For thy life! (Seizing Roberto.) Monk, or else fiend! be mute! 'Tis true, my friends, That malice, or just Heaven, hath avenged The wrongs of Italy on the Hungarian! Terlizi. The Assassins have escaped? Duke. They were the swifter, And had advantage of the distanceâ Roberto. Doubtlessâ Duke. Againâand I will slay you! Roberto. Let me go, then! Duke. Goâwith my scorn! [Releases Roberto. Philippa. Some one should tell the Queen! They called him forth From her apartment by a special message; Then, in the gallery, seized and strangled him! Evoli. The alarm has brought the Queen. Enter Queen and Attendants, followed by Salvator. Philippa. O, royal mistress! Queen. Wherefore this tumult? Philippa. Heaven! thou know'st it not! Thy royal lord is murdered! Queen. What?âimpossible! How? and by whom? Philippa. We know not! Madam! Grow not to marble! Help the Queen! [The Queen becomes cataleptic with horror. Salvator. What! Andreas! Murdered! Assassination! Are ye Christian? Or is the Court a vampyre carnival? Cannot it be but so? And ye the fiends, That play your damned parts in it, and torture The one the other, haply, for your sport? Is there nor Charity, nor Piety, In any bosom; but mock reverence, Precedence feigned, and homage for the nonce; But when the back is turned, the dagger's out? I've heard of such things, but believed them not; But 'tis no slanderâ'tis no prejudiceâ This is the Court, and here doth Murder revel! Forgive them, God! who rule us in thy name, Since heavy sins have they to answer for! Duke. What means your sire, Philippa? Surely, he Suspects not men of honorable rank, Of crime like this? No! You have to be taught, Salvator, 'tis the mean of birth, the poor In their estate, who rob and slay for hire; Not men of wealth and ancestry. Salvator. Wherefore so? Duke. For they have all to gain, since all they want. Salvator. Why want they all, unless ye first have robbed them? If soâno wonder ye are robbed in turn! Duke. Would you, suspicion then should fall on you, You hold such language? Better hold your peace! Salvator. Suspect you me? Duke. Not I, old man! This busy life With you is passed too far, that we should look To you for that same death you daily dread To make acquaintance with. This matter's, truly, Beyond your scope;âthat's all. Look to the Queenâ Philippa. She has recovered. Duke. Say you so? Her limbs Are stiff and rigid! Philippa. Ha! speak, your Majesty! Duke. Dumb hath the sudden horror stricken her! We must remove her. 'Tis with her no more Than if she slept! Let's in; we have need of counsel. [Exeunt omnes, except Roberto and Salvator. Roberto. You see, there's more in statecraft than you wist. Salvator. O, maxims crooked! Science indirect! Mere cunning, and not knowledge! Policy Not born of wisdomâspawn of desperate Wit! Leave meâ Roberto. Leave you? Why, well! All leave the Poor They not suspect; and give them tendance only, When they have need to guard them, ere they punish With chains or death. I've work on hand. 'Twere idle To waste much speech on you. [Exit. Salvator (alone). Heart of the World! Sure, thou hast ceased to beat; for mine is still, As Death alone lived in the universe! O care! O pain! O grief! I little knew Philippa's heavy yoke! no more reproaches! Amid this lodge of maniacs, being sane, I seem the only mad! Not virtue rules! Murder is prince o' the air! No wonder, then, That earth has suffered time-long tyrrany! I thank my God, that he hath left me poor, Humble of station, and unprivileged Of any order that marks man from man As something other, whether more or less, Angel or devil; for religion's self, By privilege perverted, mocks at merit, And makes him hypocrite who were a saint. O den of wealth and power! Come forth, therefrom, Philippa! noble, wise, belovÃ«d daughter! Ingenious, diligent, much-injured daughter! Beneficent, and honest, yet betrayed! Traitors and villains, authorised and crowned, Lie still for thee in wait!âthy every step Is by a pitfall dug by jealousy, Snares, gins, and traps beset thee round about! O, wicked court! where'er thy camp is pitched, It spreads a pestilential atmosphere Of lies, no honest soul can breathe and live! Change but a monastery to a palace, (We have example here,) but for a week, Less than a week, a day, an hour, a minute, What once was heaven is turned at once to hell; And Atheist Murder on the altar sits, Ape-like agrin, and sips a bloody chalice! Come forth, I say!âHa! ha! thou art accused Of witchcraft; but thou canst have none like theirsâ They have the magicâthey, the true âBlack Artââ Not thou;âby aid whereof they do usurp Upon all natural rights, all sympathies Of human love, all elements of truth, And make such havoc both of good and evil, That the Eternal needs must strike, to chaos, The world, to recreate it! I must henceâ Let me reflect. Upon thy pleasant waters, Native Catania! for my life's brief remnant, Haply, my spirit may find peace againâ I'll seek my daughter. Would that she, and hers, Might quit with me, for ever, the false tower, That hath for her been built beside the throne, Ere it shall sink into the expectant flood, That boils, unseen, unheard, beneath them both! [Exit. END OF SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Scene I. âNaples. Royal Closet in Castel-Novo. Philippa and Terlizi discovered. Philippa. 'Tis a strange humor! Go, Terlizi! set Sancha to watchâ Terlizi. I will. Philippa. In good time, look, The Duke Durazzo comes. [Exit Terlizi. Enter Duke of Durazzo. Duke. How is the Queen? Philippa. Prince, from the stupor that long mantled her, She has aroused, and is again herselfâ Duke. 'Tis wellâ Philippa. Not wellâshe is again herself, But 'tis another self. Duke. Explain your riddleâ Philippa. She will, forsooth, make sure against suspicion, Henceforth, by trusting none. No hand but hers Shall sway the realm. Duke. Sure, she suspects not you? Philippa. I know not; but enquiry full is making, And heaven grant it may unmask the traitor. Duke. Who makes it? Philippa. Hugh del Balzo. To his zeal The Queen has trusted all. Duke. Zeal without knowledge. Philippa. Nor will she meddle with it, so she vows, In process or in sequel; seeing that Louis of Hungary, her husband's brother, Impeaches her of guilt, and threatens war, Nay, makes it;âand, for insult, it would seem, Refers decision of the suit between them Unto Rome's Tribune, to Rienziâhe, Of all the Powers that be, to arbitrate, Whether the Queen of Naples slew her lord! Therefore she keeps, retired, impartial state, And Hugh del Balzo holds the inquisition. Duke. What proofs has he? Re-enter Terlizi. Philippa. Roberto one, and one Geronimo. The Monks had fled from Naples, With the Hungarians, but were overtakenâ These make two famous witnesses! Duke. Enough! No time to lose. Philippa. What now? Duke. I am as one, Who, rushing on a bull's horns unawares, Is gored ere 'tis perceived. I must from Naples! Though guiltless as yourself, yet must I fly! Well know I Hugh del Balzo, He's a man Who sees the form of things, but ne'er the substanceâ Therefore, an instant farewell! [Exit. Terlizi. This is strangeâ Philippa. 'Tis very strangeâyet I divine the secret. But where's Salvator? Terlizi. He is resolved on leaving Us and the Court together, but desires To have a previous audience of the Queen. Philippa. Come with me, then. First, in the Library, Some letters I would dictate; then will seek him. [Exeunt. Scene II. âState Apartment. Salvator alone (seated by a Column). How long will Freedom tarry? and to Man, Man other seem that in his Maker's eyes? And Wealth and Power, that should be Virtue's badges, Give Lewdness means to cater for itself, And strong Oppression sovran Masterdom; While Indignation sits aloof in Heaven, Brooding in vain upon the wrongs of earth? O! this it is, makes Conscience infidel, And private Judgement beard Authority, And stung Rebellion in revengeful hearts Strike at usurped dominion! This it is, Wherewith the womb of Nature groans in pain, Till her deliverance come! O, Italy! Even now thou'rt teeming with a mighty birth, And Prophets hail thee both in speech and song; Poets, who call thee by the name of Love, And celebrate with passionate ecstasy; And Orators, whose inspired eloquence Would half create a people from the stones That pave the City's streets. One, at this hour, Is pleading, Rome! unto thy popular heart, And thou art trembling as Rienzi speaks. While NaplesâO great Heaven! I must no moreâ The hand of age is on me! Down, my soul! Time was, when thoughts like these had been the throes Of resolution; but abortive now The travail of my once too pregnant mind! Enter Sancha. Sancha. Salvator here? Salvator. I wait the Queen, dear child! Meseemed it were bad manners, should I quit Her court, without again her presence seeking, And bidding farewell to her Majesty. Sancha. You will, then, leave us? Salvator. Yes. Told you the Queen? Sancha. I have. Her Majesty is busy with Letters from Louis, King of Hungary; Nay, now is so disturbed, it were not meet You should intrude. âAlas!â she says, âshe has not Shown you example of much courtesyâ She's shamed, indeedâO, most unhappy time!â Salvator. O, grief, indeed, to Naples! Sancha. More to herâ Have you not heard, that the Hungarian Louis Charges our Mistress with his brother's murder, Citing her to appear, and plead her cause, Before Rome's Tribune, the upstart Rienzi? Salvator. Girl! say you so? Rienziâ Sancha. Even heâ Salvator. The noblest spokesman of the liberties Of man, that ever thrilled man's raptured ear, With speech more beautiful than song,âbecause Its theme is music, and, being such itself, Needeth not such for foreign ornament. Sancha. A Queen to plead her cause before a man, Whose parents kept an inn, and washed for hire The linen of their betters! Salvator (after a long pause). Can it be?â [Intently gazing at her. Sancha. What mean you, father? Salvator. Come, girl! tell me trueâ Or rumour lies, or Petrarch oft has been Guest at the Court of Naples? Sancha. Many a timeâ Salvator. He was Rienzi's friend, while that Rienzi Was servant unto others; Petrarch, girl! Was this Rienzi's friend; and Petrarch was Thought fit by your good Queen to grace her Court, Being a scholar. Why should not Rienzi, Being a scholar too, and Petrarch's friend, Be worthy of a Court? He's now Rome's Tribune, And might have been her King. And who art thou That scorn'st his humble parentage? Sancha. The daughter Of Count Evoliâ Salvator. I have lived too long! I thought you loved me, and my heart grew to you, And blessed you, as you hovered round my couch. Sancha. Strange had it been, if bred in courts, I'd lacked Of courtesy, where duty, sir, no less than The Countess's commands, had bid me reverence. Salvator. Duty! commands!ânot nature, and free love! Now I could prophesy. The air around Is full of spirits' voices, and their pressure Permits me scarce to breathe! What needs the Queen, To judge her cause, more than an honest man? I, as an honest man, acquit her now; Yet, were I named her judge, think you, she'd scorn To take acquittal from me, not being Tribune, Because I am an humble fisherman? You're silent! Thank the heavens! I have seen your soul! Farewell, I now shall die: nor leave behind An object of regret! Sancha. I meant not, sir, To move you soâ Salvator. No, girl!âI do but dote! Let me embrace you once more as an equal, And then farewell! God bless you! Fare you well! [Hurries out. Sancha (alone). What have I said, to wrong his nature thus? I feel a sinner, yet am ignorant Of my transgression! Weeping, he returnsâ Re-enter Salvator. Salvator. Girl! liveâbe happy! All the Saints upon you [She kneels. Shower from their golden censers every joy, And keep away the evils that I dreadâ Once more, farewell!âand holy angels guard you! [Exit Salvator. Sancha (alone). Alas! I tremble with the mystery, That makes his venerable passion seem The inspiration of a Seer's rapture! All is enigma too! The Queen's perplexed, The Countess and the Seneschal suspected! Why is all this? But I must to my dutyâ Darkling, a shadow gathers on our path! [Exit. Enter Balzo and Duchess of Durazzo. Balzo. Not one must quit the palace; therefore, lady, Pardon this interruption. Duchess. Before Heaven! I knew not of the absence of the Dukeâ Balzo. I doubt it nothing; still thy princely lord, I must repeat, has fled. The proofs against him Are strong and most direct. Duchess. It cannot beâ That he did loath Hungarian Andreas With an Italian soul, I must admit; Might have desired his death, or on occasion Have compassed it; this I would not deny: But that he had occasion, or thereof Availed himself, the contrary I know. And much I wish he had not fled from Naples, Since misconstruction may to mischief ripen! But I will to my sister, our good Queen. Balzo. That I permit. But deem not your persuasion Can with her Majesty avail you aught. She has herself divested of control, Putting the business wholly in my charge, And I will sift it with a loyal spirit. [Exeunt. Re-enter Salvator and Giulio. Salvator. Barred from immediate egressâsay, good Giulio! If you have so much knowledge, what imports it? You look dejected, boy! and shake your headâ By the command of Hugh del Balzo, (thus Were we informed,) the palace-gates were closed On all its dwellers; not a soul might stir Of those within its walls! So back must we; We are prisoners hereânor you, nor I, aloneâ But all. Can you not speak? Giulio. Grief makes me dumb! And ignorance stifles what I else would say! This know I only, I am innocent Of Andreas' murder. Salvator. So am I, boy! Ha! Blood will have dreadful inquisition! Well! Boy! Your clear conscience keep you unabashed! Look up!âWhy drooping still? Giulio. You know not, then, The Countess is suspected with her lord, Her son, her household? Salvator. Justice! blindly swooping, Wilt thou make sudden clearance? Wrath, not Justice! Murder for murder! Where are human hearts? Giulio. Mine, sir! is wrung already with a doubt That sits on it, like death! The Lady Sancha! Salvator. Thou lovest her? Tush, boy, she is a child! She's safe, whoe'er's in peril! Giulio. Out! alas! Thou little know'st such things as these! Wo's me! I'm native to the curse! [Exit. Salvator. Where is Philippa? Enter Philippa. Philippa. Here, honored father! Salvator. Honored! ay, indeedâ The father of a Countess! So they call thee! O, Countess, truly! Rank, thou wert not born to, Has been thy ruin! Tell me, has it not? Philippa. Indeed, there's much to dread! Salvator. There's much to dread? There's all to dread! O, madness of ambition! O, had you been contented to remain The humble nurse, that was your office first, Nor aimed at rule, where principalities Sit on their authorised and natal thrones, All had been safeâall had been very safe! An honorable name, too, had been thine, The foster-mother to a line of princesâ Which now of a suspected murderess is The hated appellation! Heaven and Earth! Was never misery so completely wretched! Philippa. In this deep trouble, let my tranquil soul Have leave to wait on judgement! Salvator. I have doneâ I but usurp a right, which long disuse Has taken from me. The sacrificer's come, Together with their victims! Agony! Enter Queen, Duchess, Sancha, Giulio, Evoli, Terlizi, and others. Queen. Our palace is our prison, good Salvator! Else 'twere not thine! Salvator. A bitter verity! Queen. It is not civil to translate my words, Into a deeper meaningâ Salvator. I have no choiceâ I speak but as an idiot. (To Terlizi.) Hither, Count! Didst thou not wed my daughter? Terlizi. Ay, Salvator! Nor have repented sinceâ Salvator. Thou hadst no reasonâ Would she had none! Queen. Salvator! doubt not Our will, or power! Salvator. I put no trust in princes! âWhere is my grandchild? Sancha (kneeling). Here, sir, at thy feet! Salvator. Why liest thou there? Sancha. For pardon! Salvator. Wherefore, girl? Sancha. For that unconscious fault I late transgressed in! Salvator. There is more grace in you, my dearest girl! Than in us all together! Innocent! Up to my heart! there growâbut oh! I fear The soil's so worn, that thou must wither there! [Raising and embracing her. What wait we for? Sancha. For Hugh del Balzo. Now, Here, at this time, he promised to pronounce His final sentence, and adjudicate. âHere comes his messengerâ Enter Talano. Talano. The Chancellor sends His greeting, to prepare your Majesty. He's at the palace-gates with troops, and prays Admissionâ Queen. Troops! Admit him, ne'ertheless! My word is passedâ [Exit Talano. Philippa. Thy word is passed! With troops? Would he besiege the palace? Ha! [The Gates at the back of the Scene fly open. Balzo, with Soldiers, Roberto, and Geronimo, enter. The Monks! I see it now! Queen. Astonishment, Sir Hugh! Well nigh had silenced us. Yet can we question This strange proceeding. Balzo. Strange means are needful, When not alone great crimes, but criminals, Have to be brought to justice. Queen. Whom accuse you? Balzo. More than are present. Great Durazzo's Duke Has fled to Louis, to complete the treason He here commenced. Duchess. 'Tis false! Balzo. I bear the sword Of Justice, lady; and demand respect. Queen. You're right in that. Proceed. Balzo. Of those now present, I claim to attach the Seneschal Terlizi, The Countess of Montoni, Count Evoli, And Lady Sanchaâ Salvator. A mere child! Save her, Wouldst scape the charge of malice! Balzo. Peasant, peace! Be thankful your low nestings challenge not The storm that shatters turrets, where the eagles Their perilous eyries build! Salvator. I do submit: Yetâby the wondrous patience of the poor, Their baffled sympathies for happiness, For comfort, and all the decent usages,â I pray you, hear me! Balzo. Peace! Salvator (aside). So chained they once Prometheus to a rock, whose suffering Most tragic passion was! So chain they meâ And I, like him, must bear! [Salvator watches the progress of the ensuing scene with intense emotion. Queen. What are your proofs? Balzo. The evidence of these two pious friars. Queen. How? Balzo. If your Majesty will please to listen, What prejudice soe'er you may have cherished, You will abandon. Queen. Well! Balzo. Unwilling witness Is each; for both had fled with the Hungarians, And were brought back by forceâthe rather, since I had remarked it was the wont of one, To note, each day, the accidents thereof, Within a table-book or diary, He kept about his person. Queen. Which is he? Balzo. Geronimo. Queen. Go onâ Balzo. The Monk secured, after much pains, I wrung this record from him. Here it isâ Wherein, at better leisure, you may read, How often Duke Durazzo publicly Vowed Andreas' death, within the Countess' hearing, The Seneschal's, and all his household's. Oft Would they be seen, even in your Majesty's And royal Andreas' presence, grouped together, Having most evident business apart, Wherein you might not share. Next, on the night Of the assassination, they were nigh The very spot; nay, more; Roberto tempted, And sounded him with treasonous provocation. Last, came the assassins, who are known to have sought The Duke Durazzo, then in company With those now present, and by him were shown To the King's chamberlain, and, afterwards, Were of that officer enquired about, With vehement speech and gesture. Queen. But meanwhile, The Countess sat with us within our chamber, Waiting return of our departed consort, Who, to our sorrow, never did return! Balzo. Uneasily, as you have oft confessed, And wondrously impatient of his absence, And, as by instinct led, which might be knowledge, Found out the murder firstâbut yet too late, For its prevention. Queen. Should it be so, let The world sink into chaos, for the columns It rests on crumble daily! Salvator. Manifest And proper fraud! Think of the plot, the monk Would have contrived with me. Is that, too, noted Within his table-book? Balzo. Poor, erring peasant! The converse you refer to, there is written, But wears a different hue from what you gave it, And shows your ignorance misinterpreter Of speech not innocent only, but well meant. Salvator. Wo to the world! that clerkly skill, for ends Divinest meant, should be to such abused! Queen. What answer makes the Countess? Philippa. Innocence! Queen. Butâ Philippa. Nay, if in your soul, your Majesty Know me not innocent, I scorn to urge Useless asseverationâ Queen. You do well!â Monarchs should put no confidence in friendship! I'll to my chamber! Philippa. Short-lived in thy friendship, As those poor lilies that but bloom a day, Not, like the hyacinth, friend in wintery need! Queen. (emphatically). Too early widowed! Countess, there are sorrows That slowly undermine, as well as those That overwhelm o' the sudden. Fate on me Her quiver empties. Balzo! is there more? Balzo. Nothing, but that your Majesty retire, Leaving the prisoners in my custody. Queen. Let it be so! Attend meâall! [Exeunt Queen, Duchess, Giulio, and Attendants. Philippa. A moment, Good Chancellor! with my fatherâand alone! Balzo. 'Tis granted. [Exeunt Balzo and omnes, except Philippa and Salvator. Salvator. Countess! verily, a Countess! O, bitterness of sorrow! Comeânow, laugh! Nothing but Countess! Countess of Montoni! I give you joy! joy! joy! You are a Countess! Philippa. Scorn me not! Salvator. Ha! ha! ha! A countess scorned By a fisherman! Ne'er mind, my child! thou art The daughter of an honest man! thou art! Ay, and his honest daughter! Philippa. Think you so? Salvator. I doâmost veritably! What are titles, Power, or riches, which can thus leave bare Their duped possessors! To the true good soul That, when divested even of the body, Still holds entire its god-like attributes, What are they, daughter? Philippa. I've solemnly thought of it! Salvator. Then go in peace! I yet may find out means To save youâor, if notâ Philippa. I am immortal! [Exit. Salvator. Where is the menial took my cloak from me? Enter Bruno on one side, and Roberto and Geronimo on the other. Ye are comeâAnd thou, too? It is time I left The palace? Bruno. So I am bid to say. Salvator. Anon! [Exit Bruno. Roberto. Salvator! we are chargedâ Salvator. With many a trouble, Which, were ye what ye seem, would ne'er have pained youâ Roberto. By Hugh del Balzo, Chancellor of Naplesâ Salvator. A blind but honest man, whom ye have cheated To think his darkness, lightâ Roberto. To warn youâ Salvator. Me?â Roberto. 'Twere prudent you should quit Naples without delayâ Salvator. Without reward? Which, were it offered, I should spurnâmark that! But have deserved. I need not bid you mark it, 'Tis in your fellow's Table-book! Is't not? Roberto. We have no business with you, but the duty We're charged withal. Salvator. Poor wit, that must so often Say the same thing! Roberto. And that imports your absence, Which, if not willingly accorded, will be Enforcedâ Salvator. By whom? Roberto. The Chancellor. Your wisdom, For which you have acquired repute, will teach you, The popular mind at such a juncture may be Made dangerous by your presence. Salvator. Um! Roberto. And thereforeâ Salvator. So ho! so ho! I'm grown into importance! A politician, without knowing it! A principleâa powerâi'th' State; perhaps, i'th' Churchâ Most certainly i'th' Church, whereof the Poor Have been the pillars ever! Roberto. Do you scorn us? Salvator. Most heartily! But not your message, though; And much respect the sender. Tell him thatâ Geronimo. No more? Salvator. Whate'er you please, besidesâexcept The truth. Geronimo. Fear not. Salvator. Not I! Ye cannot speak it. Re-enter Bruno (with cloak). What, if ye could?âGood friend! you've brought my cloakâ Thank you! A little while! [Exit Bruno. Why go ye not? Geronimo. We've order to attend you out of Naples. Salvator. Have ye? Am I suspected, then? and ye, My gaolers? Faugh! Am I your prisoner? Roberto. Not so, Salvator! 'Tis but friendly caution. Salvator. See you this cloak? Roberto. We do! Salvator. Wo't put it on? Roberto. Why so? Salvator. Having been worn on honest shoulders, Being recognised, the one of you that wears it, May be mistaken for an honest man! Roberto. Nay, leave these fancies! Come along with us! Salvator. Never! lest men should judge of me by you; Born and baptisÃ«d liars! hypocrites By nature and by grace! Ye wear a cloak, Holy as this is honest; wrap in it A mortifying carcase, crumbling piecemeal, And feign 'tis quick within with wholesome life, Albeit corruption's stench is rank upon it, And not a lazar's body but, compared, Is clean to it! Go ye your own waysâI'll Not walk with lepers, lest I too grow scaly! Enter Giulio. Young man! you're welcome! Giulio. To despair? Salvator. Why so? Giulio. Balzo will put her soft limbs to the question, To force confessionâ Salvator. Ha! The rack! Giulio. He will! Salvator. The Queen! I'd see the Queen! Canst get me audience? Giulio. I will endeavourâ Salvator. Instant, boy! [Exit Giulio. Alone! I will be left alone! [Exeunt Roberto and Geronimo. Now, to my mind, Those twain so wicked show, that Heaven will fail To vindicate itself, if they not perish By some strange, sudden doom! The question! ah! My heart is on the rack! The Queen is young And merciful; I'll show her such respect As shall, like worship, plead with her for pity! How speeds young Giulio? I must follow him! [Exit. Scene III. âQueen's Apartment. Enter Queen (with a book) and the Duchess of Durazzo. Queen. Have I no leisure? I would read, to teach My soul some patience. Duchess. Hear me, royal sister! Giulio pleads with such passion, and the old man With tears and such entreaty claims admission, That, as the sister of your heart, no less Than love, I pray you, let the young man take Your signet to forbid the horrid question, And to Salvator grant immediate audience. Queen. Here, take itâ[Giving signet,] and send in the reverend suitor. [Exit Duchess. (Sits.) What was't I read just now? I'll read't again. When throne and life have been at stake, there is not In history an example of a Monarch, With whom the lives of subjects innocent, Or even meritorious, ever seemed Of weight enough to counterpoise the peril. A churlish saying, even if it be true. Enter Salvator. He comes. Salvator! doubtless, thou hast learned I have anticipated your request. Salvator. I thank thee for the part that thou hast granted. Queen. Have I not granted all? Salvator (anxiously). Are they then free? Queen. Free! not content with less? Salvator (emphatically). They are innocentâ Queen (rising). Who made thee Judge? And wert thou such by office, Affection in thee, and predominant will, With jealous humour, would confuse and trouble State, order, ceremony, reverence, Devotion, equityânay, understanding. I know not whether thou hast strength of soul, To act the part of Brutus with his children; But this I know, that thou hast cause for thanks, That, with the station, thou art spared the trial! Salvator. What trial spared? Am I not, then, a man, Because a poor one? O! if they were guilty, Each man would be their judge, and I, as one, As well as he who doomed them; but, if guiltless, I suffer more than any, be they punished. Queen. Then you, without authority, are equal In all things, to those with, except in suffering! And thereâyou are superior? Salvator. For we lack The authority, that can remit the sufferingâ Queen. Yet doth impose it?âHa! Salvator. I speak not now Of such, but one who had authority A little while ago. For one who well Has served you, during many years of life; For her I plead; and not for such as I am. Yet scorn not thou the advocate! Even I Once did a good thing for you. Should worse earthquake Than that which then rocked Naplesâand I read such In the times' aspectsâthreat her civil peace, Not in her soil, but in the popular soul, And I be living then, I shall be ready To dare again the gulf, and save my country! [The Queen becomes abstracted, listening to low rumbling sounds. Thou'rt stonied! Queen. Hear'st thou nothing? Salvator. Nothing, lady, But my own voice pleading to thee! Queen. Not the sounds, (Alas! in Naples too familiar!) Prelude the shocks, such as that awful nightâ Sure! 'twill not come again! Is't phantasy? Salvator! Salvator. Phantasy? 'Tis Truth's own thunder! Though prisoned 'neath the ground, it will be heard! It comes again! Heaven sends it to remind you! Queen. Have mercy, Heaven! [Prostrating herself. Salvator. And mercy teach to thee! The floor reels like a ship's deck in a storm, As on that fearful night that galley's did, And made men frantic, whom, through me, yet Heaven Wrought to a calm again!â O, Queen of Naples! Even as I said to them, I say to theeâ âBe calm, and fear not; God has heard my prayer, And spares the sacrifice for the will's sake, And lets not peril enter where I tread!â âAll's mute again, and still. 'Twas but to mind thee! Queen. And thouâwhat art thou? I do fear thee now, More than the elements! Have ye wizard power, Thou, and thy daughter? Salvator (raising her up). Be not superstitious! This is Heaven's work, not ours! Soft! footsteps! Enter Balzo (hurriedly). Queen. Balzo! Shook Earth, without these walls? Balzo. Most fearfully!â Queen. Then 'tis no sorcery! O, 'tis Heaven's own threatning! Balzo. The populace throng abroad in dread and wonder, Shouting âSalvator!â and the âwronged Montoni!â Therefore let not the old man quit these walls, Until the tumult end; then be convoyed Safe out of Naples, or imprisoned close! Queen. Touch not a hair of his head! Salvator. Bring the axe, Let it drop altogether, save but them! Save! not for my sake only, but your own! You hear the People's voice! Time is, when that Is God's. 'Tis such a time even nowâthis instant, And here; and here and elsewhere, this same age In which we live. At Naples and at Rome, Freedom or murmurs deep or calls aloud; Witness, Rienzi made the judge of princes! There's that is slumbering in this hour's abyss, Which threatens worse than earthquake! Men's wrath ere now Has silenced stormsânay, earthquakes! Moral shocks The antique foundations of all present Order Do underlie, and wait to bury it! Let me serve you in this, converting you To my persuasion! After which, beyond These palace walls, my words I'll pour, as oil On billows turbulent, into the minds Of the distracted vulgar, and make peace! Balzo. Danger wears not one visor now, but many. Queen. What other face now shows it? Balzo. Louisâ Queen. Well! Balzo. Of Hungary, great lady, close on Naples Advances now, and takes us by surprise. Queen. Treachery on his part, then! Our trial waits, As now Salvator said, Rienzi's sentence. Balzo (sarcastically). Sorry am I to dash Salvator's hopesâ Rienzi's upstart power is at an end, The people have betrayed him to the Barons, And he a fugitive beneath the ban Of papal censure. Queen. Excommunicate? Salvator. Is 't so? O popular breath! O fickle wind! All points of the compass boxing! All rehearsed, Not one omitted!âWhere thou listest, blow! My soul is sick to death! Queen. Comeâyou, Salvator! Are of the spirit that infects this age? Salvator. Your Majestyâ Queen. Start not! I am not offended, It may be, pleasedâ Salvator. I am too old, my liege, To be an actor in unpractised scenesâ Queen. But not a thinker on them. You have heard: Now, for your counselâ Salvator. Will you take it? Queen. I had Made up my mind to do so, ere I asked youâ You've won upon my faith, and exercise Strange influence, I cannot now resistâ Speak!â Salvator. Suddenâ Queen. Sudden inspirations are Ofttimes the best! Salvator. Thus, then:âThe Pope, we know, Smiled on Rienzi, and he dwelt in sunshine; That smile withdrawnânight cometh! Queen. Trueâwhat follows? Salvator. Go to the source of light, denied to him, And to your cause in him; and seeking it, The light may shine on you, and on your cause. Queen. Mean you, that I should plead my cause before The Pope? Salvator. I mean soâin your proper person. Queen. Leave Naples? Salvator. Yes, for Romeâ Queen. My Oracle! I'll do thy bidding! Wilt trust thy daughter's cause, To the same judge?âYou hesitate! Salvator (after a mental struggle). Be it soâ Though here I grope my way, in darknessâ Enter Giulio (hurriedly). Giulio. Pardon, Let plead my news! Queen. Speak, Giulio! Giulio. Blood is shed I' the streetsâ Salvator. Whose? Giulio. The Monks', Roberto's and his brother's! Salvator. I thought it would be so, if Heaven were just, Which he who doubts, himself's no doubt unjust! Impede me not! My peril 'mongst the people Shall be your safety! [Exit. Queen. Goneâthusâand in silence? I'm awed as by a mystery! Listen, Balzo! There's noise and strugglingâ Enter Talano (hurriedly). What's the matter? Talano. Madam! Armed men, from out the crowd, into the palace Have broken way, and seized upon the Duchess. Queen. My sister? Talano. And have borne her offâ Queen. Ha!â Enter Bruno. What else? Bruno. They, who bare off the princess, came athwart Salvator at the gatesâ Queen. What then? Bruno. On him They likewise seized, and bare him too away! Queen. Enough! Be gone! [Exeunt Talano and Bruno. To council! This is more Than common peril! I must be myself! I will to Rome forthwith, myself alone! [Exeunt. END OF THIRD ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. Scene I. âAversa. Wild Ravine, near Aversa. Beppo, Ghino, and Zeppa discovered. Zeppa. Tell me how it was. Beppo. Nay, good Zeppa! there was in it as much jest as earnestâ Ghino. Ay, by'r lady! that there was, and more too! Zeppa. Then, by St. Iago! tarry not in the telling o't. Your tale infected with a jest, like viands with the fly, must to the cook at once. Delay would spoil it! Ghino. You tell it, Beppo! I am no historian. But do not lose, mind you, the joke for the facts! Beppo. Never fear me, Ghino! I'll be a true chronicler: you shall have plenty of fancy to your small germ of truth. Zeppa. A pregnant germ, then. But, beginâ Beppo. About this time, yesterday, good Zeppa! were these legs of mine dangling, look youâgracefully as now they areâover the dim edge of this ravine; and, mark you, this head of mine was also nodding forward and backward,âthus!âtyping the doubt that even then pothered my poor brains, whether it were not wiser to leap the precipice, and end at once the dream and doubt, than still to endure this idle life and its unsatisfied wants. Ghino. Ay, and I was thus recumbent by his sideâ dreaming tooâ Beppo. You were asleep, Ghino! and snoring like a gorged boar. The horrible music, by disturbing my thoughts, would not permit my mind to make up a bold resolve. Howbeit 'twas well I nought determined. Our lady had better destiny in store, and now tuned thy nasal organ on purpose, to suspend my no less rash than prompt decision. Ghino. Resolveâdecision! All needless trouble! Do nothing, and the saints provide all! So acted they in life, and it would be hard, if, after death, they did not for their votaries what for them their predecessors had done. Beppo. Why else should they be canonised? Zeppa. On with your storyâ Beppo. Well, then! While I was pondering and Ghino serenading the echoes, roused reluctant by his trombone from the rocky couches where they slumber; who should come up, but, on horseback, with half a score of followers, the Duke of Durazzo? âWhich of you,â he demanded, âcan guide us to the camp of King Louis of Hungary?â ââThat can I!â boldly replied Ghino, waking up on the sudden. Ghino's always alive to business, even when dead asleepâ Zeppa. His rest is but the pause 'tween storm and storm. Beppo. I then wished it had been perpetual. O, the folly of human wishes! âHa!â cried the Duke, âThat voice! By heaven! it is one of the assassins! Seize them!â At the word, we were in the grasp of his men. Zeppa. How did it end? Beppo. Right! I will make short work of it, as, in sooth, I then did with the Duke. I warrant you, I soon made it clear, how those two faithless monks had betrayed us both. Nor was it long ere we planned revenge together! For even, at that moment, came Torello, from Naples, with news. The Countess of Montoni, with all her household, had been arrested by Hugh del Balzo: the populace, no less than the Lazzari, were ready for a rising. âNow,â cried the Duke, âI'll keep your secret, insure your pardon; only incite your fellows, in sufficient numbers, and visit Naples instantly! Find ye the crowd apt, and stir afoot, seize the advantage, enter the palace, secure the Duchess of Durazzo, whom, in my haste, I left behind; but here desire with me. Take this ring, and conduct her hither. As for the false monks, should ye meet, ye will know how for their treachery to reward them. But do all in the names of the Countess of Montoni, and her peasant father. Salvator, if possible, secure too, and bring back, as trophy; his presence here may be needful, his cause expedient to our policy. Will ye do it?â âWe will!â So we sware it, and thus parted;âhe for Louis' camp, andâ Zeppa. You for Naples. Beppo. Assuredly.âAnd by St. Jago! we found all ripe for action. As the saints would have it, a brief but decided shock had brought the frightened people into the streets, full of the remembrance of what Salvator had done in the last earthquake. We swept amidst them, like a hurricane; and there in the Bay, whom should we behold but the dastardly monks?â Zeppa. Geronimo and Roberto? Beppo. Ay.âAt once we denounced them, and, with the word, sent a blow! It silenced their treasonous malice for ever! That blow! 'Twas as if it had been struck for freedom! And when we cried, âFor the palace!â we were borne within the gates on a thousand shoulders. Why waste speech? Both the Duchess and the Catanese are here! Zeppa. Nowâwhere's the jest? Beppo. Is there no jest in the rhyme that burlesques heroic action? Is it no jest when basest motive is misnamed of noblest cause? Why, then, life is a jest! Who can but laugh at such things? Zeppa. Nor laughânor weepâbut bear an equal mind. 'Tis in vilest habit oft Providence disguises most sacred justice; Liberty not seldom is the child of strange occasion. Where the monks meant malice, Heaven had purposed deliverance. Let confusion grow, and ruin come of it; a phÅnix may rise from the ashes. Beppo. You have been your circuit? The glow of high discoursing is yet on your lips. Zeppa. I have, boys! and the issues await but opportunity. I have encountered burning spirits in rocks and valleys, in wild retreats and mountainous concealments; nor there, alone; but, in the heart of Naples, they have answered to the spellword. The Brethren have slain the Wolf to avenge the Lamb! and over the bleeding corse have sworn, against tyrannous power, an oath, whose smallest whisper shall make monarchs tremble. Talk no more, Beppo!âthink no more of ending, by self-violence, the dream and doubt! live on! Fear is despicable; Despair is criminal; Courage and Hope are the indispensable attributes not only of uncommon heroism, but of ordinary virtue. Hark! hush!âthe Duke and Duchess approach:âbreak off!âseem idle! Enter Duke and Duchess of Durazzo. Duke. What make ye, loiterers! here? To the King's tent! Be wary of your speech; ye'll find him, fellows! A subtle questionerâ Beppo. We shall be cautiousâ [Exeunt Beppo, Ghino, and Zeppa. Duke. Maria! Duchess. Back to Naples! take me back! The sister of the Queen of Sicily Demanded more respect. Dragged hitherward, By LazzariâI thought them at least soldiers, Else even your signet-ring had not prevailed! And what reception? How does Louis take it? Is he content to hear me give him proof, That she he wars against is innocent? Who, then, is guilty, if the Queen be not? His vengeance craves an object! will have one! Whom shall he strike?âfor some one he will strikeâ It may be, thee! Do you regard your safety, If not my honour? Instant back to Naples! Duke. More than my safety, my own honour! Thine Need dread no violation. I know Louis, Suspicious and revengeful, coarse in both; Like an Hungarian: but Italian wit Shall more than match his rudeness. Never fearâ Duchess. Wit! late o'erreached, yet no less trusted to; O'erreached by âcoarseâ Hungarian artifice! Duke. For which the doers paid the penaltyâ The monks are dead! Duchess. I speak of witânot forceâ They died by forceânot wit; and neither thineâ Duke. Doubt you my courage? Duchess. No! But equal terms Are needed to success. Who play the stake For life or death, beware of vanity That flatters self. Think rather of thyself Too little, of thy foe too muchâbe wise! Duke. Your censure wounds me to the quick. No more! Duchess. Wilt back to Naples? Duke. If it please youâgo; But go alone! To Naples! Would you shun To share the fortunes of your lordâbe gone! Duchess. I fear not for myself; it is for thee! Duke. There is no man I dread in all the world. Duchess. Nor would I have thee any dreadâsave one. Duke. Who's he? Duchess. Yourself! Duke. To Naples! I am here Rooted! Safe here as Naples!âtill I know The balance be withdrawn from Balzo's handsâ Ha! Felix! Louis' officer and friend! Enter Felix. You seek me? Felix. And have found it hard to find youâ 'Tis strange you wander, and unsafe, thus far. Duke. Hast news? Felix. A scout from Naplesâ Duke. What brings he? Felix. The Queen's left Naples, and is now at Rome, Pleading her cause before the Pope in person. Duke. And Hugh del Balzo rules the while in Naplesâ Dear wife! you must submit. We'll in to Louisâ Felix. It was my errand. He would counsel with you. [Exeunt. Scene II. âMagnificent Tent.âOfficers discovered.âFlourish, loud and long. Enter Louis of Hungary with numerous Attendants, Duke and Duchess of Durazzo, followed by Salvator. Louis. Our Cousin of Durazzo, and fair Princess! We do repeat the welcome that we spokeâ And know, great Duke! we have, apart examined The men you brought us; how their tales cohere, We will hereafter take your judgement on! For, as to make strange matter still more strange, This step to Romeward of the Queen of Naples, Unknown to us, is not unknown to all: There's one among us, wiser than the rest! Yon peasant-father of the imprisoned Countess Had filled her office, had he not been thwarted! By his advice, forsoothâhis learnÃ«d counselâ The haughty Queen makes her appeal to Rome! And from our clutch, by means so poor as these, The vowÃ«d victim 'scapes, and Vengeance mourns The promised sacrifice, her righteous due! Duke. How know you this, my liege? Louis. By his confessionâ While all men wondered, he alone was calm; He knew already, what we knew but now! How came such knowledge to him? How to him! Whom should it come to else, if not the man Whose counsel had induced the royal mind? Where's birth and station, now? Duke. What says Salvator? Salvator. No more than this. A poor man gave such counsel, Being consulted, and it was accepted! For in the heart where beats the love of country, The wisdom lives, that at its need can serve it: There patriot vigour thrives, where virtue dwells. Were it not so, the weariness and wrong That I have sufferedâ(let me boldly speak, For death I fear not!)âhad subdued me quite, And mixed the crumbling dust that trembles on me With that my footstep, though so feeble, spurns! But Heaven hath granted, neither once nor twice, But every day, that I should serve my country! Louis. How, every day? Salvator. As all who will may doâ Seldom are great occasions given to few: But all, by abstinence and exercise, May make the body strong from earliest youth, And ripen slowly for a lengthened autumn; Guarding the heart from passion, soul from sin, And holding evil thus, with vice, at bay; To Heaven obedient, working out its purpose, And waiting on its will, full-confident That what the morrow wants it shall provide; Doing no wrong to others, and forgiving The wrong that's done to us! He who thus lives, Shall grow in health of limb, and calm of mind; Serving, by merely living; and, though late, Let but the Hour arrive, produce the Man, Prepared in secret for a public cause. âThus have I lived, and thus, in my old age, Can even endure what violence inflicts. Louis. A whining monk, without his frock! Away! Salvator. May I to Naples back? Louis. Where'er thou wilt. So that thou cross my path no more!â Forgiveness! If I forgive his murderers may I perish! Ha! the gross fraud! Scarce, man, I pardon thee, For that thou plead'st for pardon unto others! Nor would Iâbut that Vengeance were self-baffled, Stooping to meaner quarry than the game Whereto sure instinct prompts!â Forbear the presence, Youâand the restâ [All exeunt, except Louis and the Duke. Now, Coz! a word with you! And think you, then, my soul so tame, so blind, No feint, no trick, too palpable, too gross, For my delusion? ScornÃ«d instruments, The poor and vile, the refuse of the earth, Confound with ease my cunning, my revenge! Duke. If feint or trick there be, 'tis thine, not mine! Louis. Wouldst not mislead me with pretended proofs? And lull me to a peace with canting prayers? Duke. Is this suspicion, then, thy gratitude, For pledging with thee common cause, and lending To thine invasion an Italian name, Might make it look less foreign? Louis. Gratitude! But that my honour's pawned for thy protection, Death were the answer to thy false reproach! Duke. Death to thy honour, if I've cause of fear. In a fair challenge, thou hast much as I! Louis. I! Never! Duke. What suspect you? True, I left Naples, Because Misrule was gathering to a head, For indiscriminate slaughter. The young Queen, Unused to sway, and sunk in reverie, Awakened on the sudden; with wild gaze, She placed the sword in the Avenger's hand, And bade him smite where'er he would, that proof Of vengeance might assure the wondering world That she at least was guiltless. I came to thee; Thou saw'st the advantage of my cause and name, Added to thine. Now, why am I not trusted? Louis. Trusted! Who'd trust a trickster? Are you not one? Who are those Lazzari, whose aid you purchased? Apart, (mark you,) I questioned themâApart. There was no word of truth in one of them; Nay, no consistence in the lies they toldâ Yet these, forsooth, were âserviceable knavesâ It was your wordâ Duke. And isâ Louis. Repeat it not! Duke. And isâand is. Wouldst more? Louis. Too much for patience! Repeat it not againâor stand on guard! Duke. You are a King! Louis. I waive the privilege! Duke. I will not . . . for your sake! Shall I go wild, Because you lack of wit, and fail perception? This is not Hungary, but Italy! Louis (drawing). I were a fool, should I endure the taunt! Duke. Put up your sword; and learn more policy! Learn of things wiserâof our better craftâ The voices of the living and the dead. The grave itself should warn us, how we scorn What is beneath usâthere the despisÃ«d worm Feasts on the flesh of man; and man above it, However high, may be brought down as low By worms that look like men. We may not now Contemn the poor, the vile (the times forbid it)â At least, in Italy; whate'er you may, In your own ruder land! Louis. Accursed such times! Duke. They lied, you say; nor showed consistency! How could they, since they lied, and were apart Examined? Better craft than such, great King! Must he acquire, who'd reign in Italy! Louis. Which I must learn of you? Duke. Just as you pleaseâ Louis. My brother, when alive, would not be duped so! Duke. It had been better, had he been less stubborn. Louis. Stubborn? Duke. Ay!â Louis. Mend the phrase!â Duke. I will notâ Louis. Madness! Insult him not, though you have murdered him! Duke. You go too far. My hands are white as yours, My memory of him as pure as yoursâ But he mistook our manners. Breathe our air! 'Tis balm. Regard our skies! They're azure. List Our speech! 'Tis music. Not a spot by land or water, But to voluptuous pleasure tempts the soul, To-day endeared by the to-morrow's danger! Was this a place to bring a clouded brow, A sad attire, and a harsh accent, to? And did I wrong in telling him so much? And did I merit therefore his disdain? What then? I pitied, not revenged, the slight! Himself, not me, he injured. All the saints Refuse their intercession at my need, If through my malice he incurred his death! Louis. I said not that he didâ Duke. Indeed, you said soâ Louis. You are too hasty, to apply each phraseâ Had you a brother lost by savage murder, You'd have more feeling! Now, you are hard as marble! Duke. 'Tis that my heart is scorned, so hides itself. Louis. I scorned it notâ Duke. You seemed to do soâ Louis. I should not so seem, if you were not perverse. Duke. False accusation must expect denial. Louis. Traitors, assassins, wheresoe'er ye lurk, Come, from your dark dens, forth! and, unavenged, If I have twenty brothers, slay them all! For I may not lament the death of one, Unblamed; but what in other men is virtue, Pity humane, and retribution just, In me is vice, and folly, and brute malice! O these blind aims! thus striking at the air, And wounding but myself! Give me, good Heavens! A lofty mark, that I may bring it down, And, treading on, make it a pedestal, Where I may stand erect, and feel myself Raised to my wonted stature! Duke. You are not fallen, If you not think so. All the world has noted, That Andreas' death found you uncowed of mind, Of courage prompt, of spirit unrepressed, To encounter demons in his battle's cause! Wherefore degraded in thine own esteem? There is no man so high in that of others! Louis. And think you so? Then, pray, forget my rage! Duke. I pray you, forgive mine. Louis. You were too hotâ Duke. Vouchsafe your handâ Louis (passionately). No! I reserve it still, To grasp, in the death agony, with that Which smote my brother! Duke. You are royal now! Louis. And will remain so! When I lack of that, Then men may wrong me, howsoe'er they will; But till then, let them tremble! Duke. Thus resolved, And satisfied, your Majesty will grant That I retire. With reverence due, farewell! [Exit. Louis (alone). Now I could weep! But that the tears would fall Better from others' eyes! Be mine like stone, Till they have looked on Vengeance, and the Gorgon Undo the charm of old! My brother's shade Shall be appeased, though seeking to avenge him, I monster turn, and furies tame with horror! [Exit. END OF FOURTH ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. Scene I. âNaples.âPrison in Fort St. Elmo. Enter Giulio and Sancha. Sancha. What news from Rome? dear Giulio! From the tower, I saw the Courier enter, saw you meet him, Hold converse with him, question, and have answer! What news from Rome? When comes the Queen to Naples? And has the Pope acquitted herâand us? Giulio. The Queen's acquitted; that is all he knew. Ne'er in the registers of eloquence, Was such oration, as her Majesty, Before his Holiness, delivered; so Convincing and persuading, that at once He spake her pardon, and denounced her troublers Or King, or noble, or of low degree, As under censure lying, interdict, And excommunicate, if still resisting. Armed with his sacred shield, she travels straight To Louis' camp, his cause of quarrel judged, And with authority bids him depart. Sancha. O, happy news! then all must yet be well! So loved the Queen the Countess, loved her friend, Her counsellor, one who betrayed her never, Who helped her always, and with her experience Covered the ignorance of her infant sway; That to suppose she pleaded not for her, With the like warmth, and with the same success, Were to think slander! O, dear Giulio! We shall rejoice! Yet, strange! did not the courier Say aught of us? Giulio. He bore a packet, sealed For the Chancellor, with strict command to speed In his commission. Sancha. O, good Queen! Doubtless, a mandate for our liberty, She would not have delayed! Giulio. Hope, like the snowdrop, Forestalls the spring, and dies before it comes! Philippa (without). O, thankless infidel! Sancha. What cry is that? Heaven! could it be the Countess? Giulio. 'Tis the Countessâ See, where she comes! Enter Philippa, followed by Terlizi, Evoli, and Balzo. Philippa. Remorse will cling her for it! And charity should wish it, lest her soul Die unrepentant, and hereafter suffer! (To Sancha) O, your fair innocence! We are betrayed! High station is delirium, that from phantoms Flees in mad terror, then, with frantic rage, Stabs the true heart that was its only guardian! The Queen has yielded us to death and shame! She, who could plead so well to save herself, Had not a word for us, save what condemned! Thou art bewildered, girl! It makes thee senseless! Hope, turned at once to Fear, congeals young blood! Ha! Giulio! you do well to take her from me! Here kneel I, Heaven! and offer up my heart, For thine inspection! Is there murder in it? Was e'er the wish engendered, will conceived? Thou know'st it was not! She, too, must have known it, Or ne'er known me, save as an implement, But a brute sceptre, or mere hand that wields itâ No conscience to direct itâall blind impulseâ Allâ! Patience, Heaven! patience!âNothing else Henceforth I crave!â Where is Sir Hugh?âWhat more Contain the papers? I can hear them now! Balzo. The Queen neglected not to plead your cause, As here is testified, with urgent suitâ Philippa. I would not wrong her Majesty! Proceed! Balzo. But to the Pope told all, even to the point, 'Twas, by your father's counsel, she appealed Unto his holiness, adducing it In witness of his piety and yours, That it might turn the balance in your favor. Philippa. What then? Balzo. The Pope summed up the proofsâ Philippa. As how? Balzo. Much to her wonder, thus:âThe influence, So strangely exercised by you and him Upon the royal mind, was more of weight Than other circumstance, and justified The popular notion of some witchcraft in it. Philippa. Down, turbulent disdain! deep as my soul! Balzo. As for the further evidence, whereon, From the monk's table-book, was sentence given, The witnesses being dead, means were withdrawn Of its reversal; it must stand confirmed; Nay, and the Church required some expiation, Touching her loss in their untimely end; Nor could the Queen object to make return, In common thankfulness, for good received. Philippa. Sold! sacrificed! O, impious merchandise! Balzo. How could the Queen reverse the Pope's decree? Philippa. I thank you, sir! Why are you standing there? You would not gaze upon our misery? Or execute us with your own hand?âwould you? We have some minutesâhalf an hourâa quarterâ Ere we become the headsman's! Balzo. 'Tis my duty That makes me urgent. Nothing shall you lack Of due observance. Wait, till you hear furtherâ [Exit. Philippa. I'll wait till Doomsday, when thyself shall hear, Thyself, the Queen ingrate, the Pope corrupt, The dreadful Trump that shall awake the world, And summon, even from the unsounded seas, The sinner to the audit of the Judge, By whom each several cause shall be re-heard, And a true verdict registered alone! Terlizi. Bring Sancha to us, Giulio! Evoli (embracing Sancha). My daughter! Philippa. My husband and my son! [They form a sculpturesque group. Why, what is this? Extermination, and not punishment! Tell me, seem we not now like Neptune's priest And his devoted children, whom of old AmphibiÃ¦ crushed, to type a city's fall? Invisible serpents clasp voluminous Our agonising limbsâthey choke our throatsâ And flourish o'er our heads their glorying crests! We gasp for life, and see each other die! In vain would saveâin vain would patience teach, By greatly quelling in the voiceless soul, Pain too profound for any cry to speak!â Insufferable pain! Shriek! howl aloud! Else die of silence! Nayâwe will be dumbâ Better to die of pride than crouch with shame! Terlizi. Shame rest on those who doom us wrongfully! Philippa. Shame nowhere rest, but be a wanderer ever! This woe will soon be passed, then shall we rest! âWants but Salvator; then the tree were smitten, With every fruitful branch unlopped upon it, And all might fall together!â(A pause.) Have you heard of him? Giulio. Not since the night that he was stolen from Naples. Philippa. How like a mystery show they to my soul, His coming and his going! Nature heaved, As from earth's caverns she had cast him up, To walk awhile her surface, and was troubled, When she at first felt his unwonted tread, Even to her centre; and, ere he departed, Her expectation once again confessed, As earthquake needed rive his grave anew, To re-admit him! Terlizi. Wild suggestions theseâ Philippa. Truths, if not facts. The world to us is shadow! We've not been of it late, and had to furnish One of our own, where fancies show as things: And since we soon must bid it now farewell, Seeing it has deceived us, let it go, As false; and charter faith to cling to these, That still we may at least believe them true, And, by imagination's healing power, Set doubt at rest. Re-enter Balzo. Balzo. I pray your pardon, Countess! The confessor awaits you in the chapelâ Believe me, that this duty is but taskwork, Which bends me low with grief! Philippa. I pity you!! But ask no payment from you in like kind; 'Tis justice, not compassion, we require!â We'll follow you. [Exit Balzo. Let us go in together! And, like a holocaust, upon the altar Yield ourselves up! Come, hand in hand, together! Shrink not, good Giulio, from the spectacle, But be stern witness of the sacrifice! And if my father be, indeed, alive, And ask you, âHow we died?â Thus tell him, âAs Became the children of an honest man!â [Exeunt. Scene II. âBay of Naples at Sunrise. Enter Salvator, with Beppo and Ghino. Salvator. Go to!âHaunt me no more! 'Tis at your peril! I warn you; ye are in peril, following me! 'Tis writ so in the stars; and here, besides, In inspiration to my soul revealed! (Aside.) What mystic feeling wakes suspicion? Ha! Should it be so? (To them.) Again I caution you! Hence, as ye prize your safety, follow not! Beppo. Nay, men have found it safe to be with you in greatest peril. We claim not to be less superstitious than our betters. Moreover, we have conveniently understood King Louis's discharge of you, to include our own. And thus have we reached Naples together. Why should we now part? Salvator. I know too much of you for sympathy. Beppo. We are not poor by choice, if you mean that, but bitter need. What you greet as a triumph, we bear as a curse. Salvator. Then, labourâ Beppo. That is a greater curse; and nothing comes of it! Salvator. The greatest blessing, and its own rewarder, Whether or no rewarded by the worldâ Beppo. Better be rich and powerful oppressors, than honest, but poor, perhaps, destitute workmenâ with no more to do than soldiers in time of peace. We work mischief for the want of other work. Salvator. Patience is work! But ye would be wrong-doers, Not patient sufferers! Yet, though slaves in soul, Ye dream of freedom for your carcases, Which means worse license than ye would suppress! But yet misdeem not. I'm not poor by choice, Though vowed to poverty from earliest life; Had it been otherwise, I'd still been poor, But not content. My rule made not my state, But made me happy, bearing with an evil, I could not change, except by dying for it, Which if all did who suffer, they would end it. But ye, so far from sacrificing life, Would not a vice. Ye do a crime, and think That Freedom gains thereby. But for men's crimes, Ere long she had gained all! Thus ye retard Her spring and summer, and no fruit matures, For April winds have blighted bud or blossom! Ghino. Come! he grows serious! Where is Zeppa? He might answer himâ Salvator. Why comes he not? O, Christ! In performance, âO Christ!â must be changed to âO heavens!â that they should think My cause and theirs is common!âLeave me, sirs! As he, more prudent than yourselves, has done. O, fool! that I should trust him to enquire Of my imprisoned daughter! Comes he not? O, that my voice might pierce her dungeon walls, And hers might answer so! Now they but echo Both hers and mine, and make us talk like madness! [Bell tolls from St. Elmo's. Toll! toll! and morn but just awake? toll! toll! How heavily it booms upon my heart, And speaks a signal meaning to my soul, As 'twere a special sorrow!âWherefore tolls it? Beppo. For execution of some forfeit life; Some legal murder! Salvator. Say you so? I tremble! 'Tis from St. Elmo's tower! her prison-house! Great God! should it be hers! O dreadful sound! How sullen-slow it floats upon the air! Enter Zeppa (hurriedly). For mercy! let it cease!âYou've comeâand lookâ Why speak you not? Has nothing tongue and voice, But that brute metal? Or doth silence best Translate the dismal language, no lips should Articulate to the ears? What of my daughter? Zeppa. You hear the bell? Salvator. Its peals are not for her? Some malefactorânot for them! Zeppa. You'll know Too surely, shortly. 'Tis their passing bell! Salvator. Let it peal on, till the strong turret rock, And nod to its foundation! Hear it, Heaven! And let the Earth hear thee! Thy thunder shall Outvoice the blatant boaster, or the shock Of lightning make it silent, while thou speakest! Zeppa. The bell hath ceased to toll! All's over now! Salvator (wildly). Peace! still it tolls! but ye'll not let me hear it! Peal on! peal on! Now it is mute indeed! And hushed the air, as if the storm were comingâ And yet I saw no flashâand see no cloudâ 'Tis the still voice that whispers to the soul! Enter from St. Elmo's Tower, and descend the rock, Hugh del Balzo, Confessor, Executioner, with his axe reversed, several Monks, Soldiers, and a train of Attendants; with Giulio following. Beppo. He dreamsâSeeâBut the Tower opens; âdown the rocky path, the Chancellor with his train wend hither. Zeppa. Look there, Salvator! Salvator (abstractedly). Instruct my ignorance, what it signifies. But there's young Giulioâthey may yet be safe, Since he is so! Beppo. Salvator! you'll have company. We'll leave you now. They are not to our liking. Salvator (rousing himself). Nay, stop! I have been slumbering! Too sure, they're guilty! Let me wakeâwakeâwake! 'Tis natural instinct works in them at last! What, would ye sneak away? Can peril come, Where I make safety? Though ye be criminals, Would ye be cowards, when there's nought to fear, Save what your fear may make? Ghino. Well! now 'tis too late to fly, and 'scape suspicion âbest brave it out! Salvator. Sit still, my heart! Ayâayâ'tis best! Suspicion! Guilt!âHa! Giulio! Giulio. I bring to you a message from the dead. Salvator. If Justice lives, they live! Giulio. Then both are dead! O, would to Heaven you had come yesternight; Haply, some spell about you might have saved them! Salvator. It mightâit might! ThenâthenâI might have saved them! And I had wished to see her once again, That we might part more kindly, ere she died! I'll not weep yet. Stand by, sad boy! awhileâ I'd look upon their murdererâ Balzo. Who is he? Salvator. Thou! Are they dead? Balzo. Even now they suffered The legal penalty for their offences. Salvator. Thou art an unprevaricating liar! Balzo. I brook not from my peers such term! For thee, There's but one answer! Thou art dangerous, Nor shalt remain at large! Salvator. Set thy guards on me! Yet think, the Queen still lives, and pledged my safetyâ Thou art a most straight-forward liar!âbold From despicable ignorance! erring stillâ Void of brute instinct, with thy prey before thee, Leaving it free, and making victim of What nature never meant to be thy prey! Thou hast slain the noble for a crime they did not, And let'st the ignoble, who were guilty, live! Nay, though they crouch before thee even now, There, like a fool, thou standest, threatening me, And bend'st no frown on them! Beppo, &amp;c. Betray us not! Salvator. Ye have betrayed yourselves! Mysterious Heavens! That for such worthless things as you, the virtuous Should perish on the scaffold, and ye safe Justice defy, though present, glaring on you With her mock, rayless orbs! Why is she blind, When villainy has eyes? Beppo, &amp;c. Betray us not! Salvator. Ye have betrayed yourselves! Balzo. Guards! seize the men! And but for the Queen's word, I'd seize on him! This jumps with some suspicions late suggested. Beppo, &amp;c. Betray us not! Salvator. Ye have betrayed yourselves! I could notâIânot being your accomplice! Assassins! regicides! my Daughter dies, And not alone; but with a race as noble, As ye are base and vile. The innocent Have suffered for your crime! Am I unnatural, That I should care as little for their fames, As ye did for their lives? Have ye no virtue, Shall I have no affection? Be advised! Need not the rack to make ye speak the truth, And spare yourselves that painâin hope the Queen May, on my intercession, pardon you! Who'll lead me where they lie? Balzo. Would you go in? Salvator. I would look on them! Balzo. Lead him, Giulio! [Exeunt, ascending the rocky path Salvator and Giulio. Better confess at once, as he advisedâ Are ye the murderers of Andreas? Beppo. We are Italiansâhe was an Hungarian! Balzo. Who set you on? Zeppa. The Monks he had cast off. [Salvator re-appears aboveâdescends hastily, wildly, and awe-stricken, followed by Giulio. Balzo. Look, he returns!âThe sight has maddened him! Salvator. Thou, Sun! now rising, with thy greater light, Blind these mis-seeing eyes! I had not thought That they were headless trunks! From their poor bodies, The beauty, crown, and ornament divorced, Nothing but mutilated columns left! Vision of ruthless havoc! All the forest Of stately trees cut down, untopped and dwarfed! 'Tis well such things in secrecy are done, Else might the ghastly sight turn back the Sun! Balzo. Justice has been too hasty. These confessâ Salvator. Justice has been asleep, while Rashness waked! Justice too hasty? She is ne'er too hasty! So tardyânever here, but coming alwaysâ She is a creditor that ne'er makes haste, But lets her debts accumulate, and then Collects them all at once! She's one 'gainst theeâ The blood of innocence will be avenged! Balzo. Those are the shedders of that bloodânot I! Lead them awayâat once! Salvator. Stay yet awhile! Mercy with Justice, for the love of grace! I ask not Vengeance! Balzo. I know my dutyâ Salvator. Duty! To give that pardon which you need yourself, That is your duty; while to seek it now, I wander back. Hugh Balzo! if, without The Queen's consent, you judgement execute, Beware of retribution!âGiulio! come! Be you the old man's crutch!âI reel, in sooth, Beneath my yoke! Were not my heart too worn To break, it sure had snapt! I do bear up Most wondrously, and inly laugh to feel How little sorrow can afflict my soul! I am grown as young as you!âCome, Giulio! come! [Exeunt. Balzo. Away with them! [Beppo, &amp;c., are led up the rockâthe procession returns. (Alone) âAy! thisâthis must be seen to! Some way to hush it up; the vulgar should not Carp at state-policyâwhich, come what will, Sits far above the reach of error still. [Exit. Scene III. âAnother Part of the Bay. Re-enter Salvator and Giulio. Salvator. Thanks, Giulio, thanks! thou'st told thy tale too well! âDied like the children of an honest man!â To me as such they have bequeathed their fames, Their reputations, dearer than their lives! Nor less to you, my Giulio! think of that! And we'll be faithful to the trust, dear Giulio! Boy, will we not? Nay, you have sworn! I am oldâ And on the road may dieâand then the duty Thou must perform! Thou swear'st? Giulio. I doâI do!â Salvator. Why did I bring thee back? Giulio. To seek the Tower again. Perchance the Lazzari Have prompt confession made. 'Twere thrift of time, To take the record with us. Salvator. And right it were, I too should enter, but the horror seen Again, would add my corse to theirs! and so Their fames were killed, at least in me! Alone, Speed, speed, dear Giulio! Giulio. Fast as love or thought! [Exit Giulio. Salvator. Good boy! He's gone. I may not linger, nor May here be safe. So far upon my road, As I precede him, so much time secured. His swifter pace will overreach me sure! Droop not, old heart! until thine errand's done! They restâand thou shalt rest in Heaven, anon! And place a spotless wreath their brows upon! [Exit. Scene the last. âAversa. Grand Interior of the Chapel of the Monastery. Enter Choir Boys, Priests, Queen, a Legate, Monks, Duke and Duchess of Durazzo, Bruno, Talano, Guards, and many Attendants.âThey arrange themselves by the Altar, which is illuminated.âSolemn music. Queen. When, pious Legate! you return to Rome, Forget not with your golden eloquence, To set the jewel of our gratitude In meet array, before your gracious Shepherd. Against the vehement and savage mind, Hungry for vengeance, of our royal brother, The sanction of his Holiness, your guard, And our known innocence, suffice for safety. Wherefore with great Durazzo and our sister We have made peace; and sent to royal Louis, That at this shrine we may consult together, And farewells, ere he quit our realm, exchange. [Flourish without. Legate. It is announced, even now he waits without. Queen. Admit him, instantly! [Exit a Monk. Your pardon, Legate, If with him there be need we bear a state Too haughty for a hallowed place like this. Legate. The need shall be the pardon. Here he comes. [Flourish again, nearer. Enter Louis. Louis. Due reverence first to sacred precincts made; Then let my speech have freedom to approach The acquitted Queen of Naples! Queen. Less of scorn! Louis. Scorn! More of it! Take Sanctuary here! 'Tis well ye do! 'tis where the Murderess should!â Queen. Murderess! Legate. The Pontiff has acquitted herâ Louis. I crave your pardon! Has he so, indeed? And so the righteous Hunger of my soul May still ache-on, and feed on its own rage, With appetite that's ne'er to be appeased! Queen. Would you appease it on the innocent? Louis. Who are the guilty? Be they one or ten, Or be they backed with armies, let me know themâ My heart is more than hosts! wilder my wrath Than men on carnage bent! By all that's here Adorable, in shrine, or niche, or vault, By rarest relic, or the dearest name Of saint or hero, were he set before us, Had he a thousand shapes, I'd quench them all Thereâon that altarâas ye would a taper, And with as deep devotion in the rite! Queen. Devotion irreligiousâ Monk. One Giulio seeks Your Majesty. Queen. From Naples. Bring him hither! So!â [Exit a Monk. Enter Giulio. What now, Giulio? Giulio (kneeling). Pardon me, If I implore, that, even while I speak, It please you, send forth messengers, to save Poor old Salvator's life! Queen. Where is he? Giulio. Some Half mile hence on the road to Naplesâ Queen. Goâ [Bruno and Talano go out. Now speak!â Giulio (rising). This morn, Salvator reached, at day-break, St. Elmo's rock, just as the bell was tolling The execution of Montoni's raceâ Queen. Their execution? Giulio. O, the innocent blood! 'Twas shed ere he arrived! Too late we met him, With certain of the Lazzari, lately found, Whom he convicted, in the Chancellor's presence, Of royal Andreas' murder. Here's the record Of their confession, for your Majesty! [Delivering paper. Which to obtain, I left him on the road, And lost him on returning. Long my searchâ At length, thank Heaven! I found him!âAgainst a slope, He lay exhausted, having fasted long And worn himself with travel. Though too weak To bid me hasten on, he scorned all aid, Till that you saw, could clear the Countess' fame! Queen. This document, you mean? Louis. What news is this? Queen. I cannot read it! every word is fire. Scorching my eyeballs! [Handling it to Louis. Louis (having read it). Ha! your men, Durazzo! Duke. Safe in the Chancellor's clutch! What did he with them? Louis. Put them to death at once; stopping their mouths, To save his mistress' honour, and his own. Queen. 'Twas on his own responsibility. Louis. Even so he saith! A politic Chancellor! (Aside.) So much for thatâbut there is more to come 'Tween you and me, Durazzo? Suddenly, I am grown calm! 'Tis well! the storm is brooding! Here comes the old man too. I'll wait what followsâ Queen. O, haste inopportune! But never more Shall Hugh del Balzo be our Chancellor! Enter Salvator, supported by Bruno and Talano. Come in, old man! this is a Christian place, Where you may hope for Christian usage yet, Whatever cause you've had, these walls beyond, To doubt if, in the world, be Christian hearts. Salvator. A cup of water!âthat my lips unparched May speak a word or two. I am foodless, but A crust would choke me!âBy-and-by, perhaps, I will take breadânot now! Some water! [Bruno brings him a cup. Thank you!â(Drinks.) How richer 'tis than wine! Louis. Old man! when last We met, you preached forgiveness to me. Can You now forgive your daughter's murder? It May be a virtue that befits your station, But is not fitting mine. Nor will I, peasant! Be duped of my revenge! Durazzo's guile Has saved my brother's murderers from my hand, To perish by another's. Lions brook not To have their prey rest from them; Courage joys To prove itself on its own enemies, And not to dare by proxy!âDuke! what say you? You shouldâyou shallâbe proxy now for them, As you have made your Chancellor one for me! By all of honour that is left to you, I charge you, let us quit this sacred ground, And freely, man to man, confer together! Duchess. Go not with him! Duke. I mustâI will!âor live The scorn of my own mind! Louis. Ay, scorn's the word! Nor you alone should plague! Thou, haughty Queen! I quit thy realm, but leave behind my curse! Thou'st spent a hecatomb of lives, to clear What yet will ne'er be cleanâthy character, Of that suspicion, which the blood thou'st wasted Only makes bloodier! Queen. Silence, rude of mouth! Savage of heart, implacable, and fierce! Louis. I speak but truth; but, speaking't, speak a curse That will cleave to thee! Take therewith my scorn! Farewell to Naples! Duke! for thee, without, I have a special valedictionâcome! Salvator. Pause! ere thou goestâBlood hath been shed enough! Thou know'st it hath! thy lips have spoken it! Louis. Peasant, away!â [Throwing him off rudelyâSalvator falls. Queen. Discourteous tyrant! thus To spurn my subject! Louis (to Salvator). I hope I have not killed theeâ I would not give base blood the cause to boast 'Twas shed by a King's hand! Salvator. It cannot now! 'Tis sunk i'th' earth, where I must follow it! Louis. I cannot heed thee! Duke! go forth! I follow [Exeunt together. Duchess. Are here the wise and prudent? nay, the holy? Yet suffer this to be! My lord! my lord! O, heathen tyrant! strange to all that's civil! I'll follow, too! I will not be restrained! Who stops me? You! [To Bruno and Talano. Attend me rather, caitiffs! [Exeunt. Queen. My sister! stay! O most unkingly manners! [Duchess shrieks withoutâFlourish, which grows distant. Can that be she? Beat, my appallÃ«d heart! Or thou'lt be ice again! Re-enter Talano and Bruno. What would ye say, Yet look as if ye could not utter it? Talano. No sooner, madam, had the Hungarian king The threshhold crossed, than on the Duke he called To stand, and guard himself; which ere he could, He plunged his poniard in him, to the hiltâ Then, circled with his train, rode swift away! Queen. Support me, pride!âGo, bring the Duchess in! Talano. Close by the corse she kneels, and will not quit! Queen. How shall I know what is the right to do? Would that I were not Naplesâbut a woman! My heart would teach me then?âHa! there is he!â Salvator too! Go, raise him from the ground! His Daughter was my friendâthe dearestâtruest! I'll know no other friend! But, like the flower That in its petals bears a hero's name, And disappointed sigh; my heart will think Alone of her, and bleed with every thought! âHow is't with thee, Salvator? Salvator. Like the dogs, Gorging themselves upon the carcases Left by a city's siege, neglect their duty And let the stranger passâso 'twas with ye; Ye were too busy with your own contentions, To care for me, or Naples! Now ye've done With havoc, ye have time to tend her peace; For me, care comes too late! Queen. Too late for all! O, the Hungarian tiger! Should we not Have chained or caged him, ere he shed alike The blood of peer and peasant? But the charm Of Rome was on our person, we had fallen! âToo late, says he? Is't possible? Salvator. His blow Only anticipated famine's work, By a few seconds. Prithee, move me not! Some vital chord, cannot be seen, is snapt! It must be, I bleed inwardly!âWeakâweaker! Queen. Now, who would wear a crown? Uncrown me, King Of Kings, and Lord of Lordsâthou Only-Wise! In performance, âYe Saints! uncrown me!â My brain is crushed with the dull weight, and I Know not, if what I do be human, or What else the heart should loathe!âFarewell to ease! My duty 'twas to reign, and not look on! Now have I none to trust, but am alone! Henceforth, my realm to me, who would be social, Though populous, a ghastly solitude! Salvator. Thanksâthanksâmy head swimsâlift me upâthat's better! Where is her Majesty?â Queen. Thou monitor Of guilty princes! spare me thy rebuke! I will atone all wrongs! be sure, I will! I will do good to Naples, such as none Could do before, or will do after meâ Attest it, Heaven! Salvator. 'Tis heard! Fatigue, Hunger, with Wrong and Age, conspire against meâ Few wordsâbut hear them!âfor Death speaks in me, And, like the phantast sleep, he prophesies! Thou shalt reign many years, wed many lords, And do much good to Naples, yet shalt live Suspected and unhappy; and thy name, After thy death, shall glory be or shame, As men shall read thy doubtful history! âMine is the poor man's fate; to labour much, Yet find therein no cure for penury; Show skill at need, yet still be deemed unwise; To be mistrusted even by those he serves, To suffer for his need as for a crime, Even when protected; and when not, to perish Of negligence, or brutal accident, And dieâas I do now!â [Dies. Legate. A requiem! Curtain falls slowly to solemn music.</field>
