      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. High labour'd lines you may expect from those, Whose pleasure is their studies: Most here knows This Author hunts, and hawks, and feeds his Deer, Not some, but most fair days throughout the yeer. Such rude dull heavy Scenes expect you then, As after suppers vapours from his pen. Would you not ask, Why then does he write Plays, Since now great Wits strive for Dramatick bays? Pardon what's past: That way now counted wit, Although enjoin'd, he'l deal no more in it: Since dying to the Stage, his last request Is, that you would not like the worst Scenes best. If this desire injurious seem to some, I wonder not: Divers to Plays do come, Not to be pleas'd, unless the Play be bad; So what th'ingenious like, doth make them sad: We tax not here their judgment or their wit, But that so much ill nature's join'd with it. Others there be, which like the Austrian race, Wits empire tyes alone to those they grace: Nay, so opinion'd of themselves they be, They'l praise things most absurd; and when they see Those whose simplicity admires their wit, To do the same, they laugh at them and it. 'Tis not these Bugbears that do haunt the Stage, Should fright an Author; since 'tis plain, this Age Hath more clear Judgments then was ever known: But most Apollo's beams break from the throne, And with a double sweetness doth invite All that have gifts in Verse or Prose, to write. Which he would still, but that his period's past; For sure you'l find this Play Worse then the last.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SECOND PART. Act. 1. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Cleon and Selina. Sel. My Lord, be confident, thus chang'd, there's none can know you. Cle. But dare I hope thou hast forgiven me? Sel. The mercy that you shewed in unbinding me, May well assure you; nor am I ignorant How far our passions may transport, aided by hope To attain our ends. Cle. But now the current of my love runs in the proper Channel, and shall ever center here, a tribute justly due Unto the ocean of thy love: Why did I fondly dream There was a happiness exceeding this? [Kisses her] Sel. Your kindness was so great, so unexpected, That I am now more yours then ever: I never must Forget the pains you took in coming to unbind me, Creeping upon your hands, all smear'd in blood, 'Twas well you scap'd with life. Cle. aside. Thanks to my privy coat; had I expir'd In such a pious action, yet so I scarcely had Deserv'd forgivenes, much less this sweet continuance Of your love, sure to be valued far above Clorinda's hate, Whose interest to a Crown made her In my ambitious eye appear more beautiful; But now, reason commands her yield to thee Precedence in my heart. Sel. How easily we give belief to what we wish! Cle. Though the Gods know how all my love is cancell'd, Justly turn'd hate to her; yet love and gratitude to thee Commands me to attempt the Crown of Burgonia, Offer'd into my hands. Sel. As how offer'd? Cle. I count it offer'd, when it appears in reason Within the reach of our endeavours: Of ours, I say, Mark me, my Queen, in thee it lies to rule me And a scepter. Sel. It is fit the honor of your love should render me Conformable to your desires: Name me the way To this your happiness, so mine. Cle. The seeming pious Druid here our Host, I have discover'd to have been a Mountebank Physitian; yet now disguis'd, esteem'd by all This Country a holy and most sacred person, With whom the Gods are conversant here in this solitary Melancholy Grove. By him with gold corrupted, I doubt not to effect revenge against Agenor For this wound most basely given me: Dispatch his brother Clarimant; nay even Clorinda (As witness of my love to thee) shall likewise bleed. This done, and this is in thy power to effect, Is not the Kingdom of Burgonia mine By right of blood? Sel. 'Tis certain, they remov'd, you are the next. Cle. Consider then, my dear Selina, what 'tis to be a Queen. Sel. A Queen! Cle. Take but these thoughts into thy soul, And there's no action difficult or dangerous: But we have only shadows to encounter with, The issue real pleasures. Sel. I must yield; dispose me, sir, which way you please. Cle. That resolution does already crown thee. Sel. I would not have you think it is my ambition, But my love engages me; but yet I fear. Cle. What can you doubt? Sel. Swear sir by the immortal Gods, To make me privy to all your actions; And when you have attain'd the Crown, to marry me, So to remove some jealousies. Cle. I do by all that's sacred; nothing but death Shall part us; this kiss be farther witnessâ [Enter Druid.] O sir, you are welcome! what news? Dru. I have no leisure now to tell you: I must disguise to entertain some curious And devout people. Exit Dru. Cle. He every day goes to the City In a several shape, so to enable himself To appear more knowing here: I wonder much None of the Court are so zealous to visit him, At least to know their fortunes, For he delivers oracles as from the Gods. Sel. No doubt there are; but now the present time Affords so much discourse of other peoples Fortunes, that they neglect the knowledg Of their own. Cle. To know the fate of others, Does often give a light to ours: At least let us be diligent, whose industry Can only make us happy: Perform but carefully That which I shall impart, And thou shalt have a Crown to crown thy art. Exeunt. Enter King, Prince, and Attendants. K. Most noble Prince! though you may well believe The forces you have brought unto my aid I shall not use, yet I must ever be ambitious To requite that love which caus'd your diligence; Nay, I shall think my happiness defective, Although great, till fortune point some way Wherein I may express my gratitude to you. Pr. Most royal Sir! fortune hath been to me Auspicious, more then had I proved Austela's Choice; and this expression you have made, Imboldens me to let you know wherein. K. Sir, I beseech you name it. Pr. Know sir, not my ambition to enjoy your Kingdom, Could so far blind my judgment, but that I ever Found your younger daughter Olinda, in herself, The more deserving love, especially from me. I would not, sir, say more, lest I should seem To boast a happiness which merit never can attain But by infinity of service, and much suffering. K. Indeed I did observe, whilst you were in my Court, You much more did converse with her then with Austela, Who ever was reserved. If Olinda's affability Have gain'd your good opinion, your courtship hers, It is a happiness beyond which I dare not expect. If it be less then this, and that by the freedom Of her humor you believe your interest greater Then indeed it is; yet there will only be Better occasion for my love to shew it self. Pr. My actions shall ever witness for me How I prize your royal favour. Exeunt. Enter Clindor and 1. 1. Did you not lately murmure against peace, Cryed up war as the only blessing? Clind. Yes, I did so. 1. I scarce remember your sword did ever purchase Such gay Caparisons. Clind. I see thou art a very simple Fellow: This is the harvest of the war; the King Whom we did terrifie, made Presents unto us Commanders. If thou canst shew me where Soldiers Are made much of in cold blood, then I will Magnifie thy mouldy mistress, Peace: Till then, Bellona, thou art my Patroness. 1. Thou talkest as if thou hadst done some mighty Matters; and yet I fear thou art a Coward. Clind. I love you, sir, too well to let you suffer Such a grief as fear, for me: Draw. 1. Draw! are you mad? or is your wit so great To spoil Your memory? were not two shot to death that were Seen fighting? Clind. Very pretty, you grow valiant to abuse me, Because their valor found a punishment. The Prince! Justice, sir, I beseech you. Enter Clarimant and Attendants. Clar. For what, or against whom? Cli. He told me, sir, he thought I was a Coward. Clar. Perhaps you have given him cause to think so. Clind. Better and better! But sir, may men speak all they think? Clar. Why not? I do so, and never will again Dissemble. Clind. But may I, sir? Clar. Yes, so it be not blasphemy or treason. Clind. How, sir, do you distinguish treason? Clar. Look what the Law says, Clind. Pox on the Law! Clar. How? Clind. I cry your Highness mercy; I had forgot the Law was so Near kin to you: This scurvy fellow has made me mad. Clar. You would not live without law. Clind. No, I beseech your Highness grant me the Law. Clar. Most willingly. Clind. The law of Arms, sir, and let him prove me a Coward [He draws] Before your Highness, and see how I will defend my self: Clar. I know not how in justice I can pardon this Unless I do pronounce you mad. Clind. I do beseech your Highness do so. Clar. Sure you are mad. Clind. Then I may kill this Rascal, and your law cannot Hang me. [Offers to strike] Clar. Bind him, to prevent mischief. Clind. Any thing to save my honor; let me not have my hands Lose; wear a sword, and be call'd Coward! Clar. He did but think so. Cli. Let him not think aloud then in my hearing. Clar. Come, I will end the difference; I do pronounce You are no Coward, and him a fool for thinking so. Be friends. Clind. Not with a fool; you shall excuse me sir. Clar. Be gone, and leave me. Ex. Cli. &amp;c. Why do I give this intermission to my sorrows? Clorinda's pleas'd I should be miserable: Since in no other way, in that I will content her. But this obedience yields a satisfaction; And satisfaction fits not perfect sufferings, Which she the perfectest of creatures feels: I can no more admit to be less miserable Then my Mistress, then I could be content to be More happy; is there no way to change my fate With hers? O no, her torment rises from the Falshood of her Lover, where she had plac'd her joys: Mine, in the not attaining of a Love Where I dare not pretend to merit: I am a happy man, if by comparison I judge: Enter Agenor, Austella. Age. Still alone, dear brother! Au. Most noble sir, why do you thus retire your self From those who know no satisfaction Greater then your company? I must pretend The interest of a sister now; you shall not Hide your passion, nor the cause from me, I know 'tis Love. Clar. Madam, it is confest: But since despair Is, and must ever be the only issue of my love, I would not have those I esteem Engaged with me in misery. Au. Can you be so unjust to your own merits To despair? Clar. So just to her perfections. Au. If not a Judge of this, at least make me Your Advocate: yet all my eloquence Will rest in shewing her the happiness That she refuses. Clar. Madam, she is not capable of any increase, She's dead to me and all mankind. Au. How mean you? by a figure, or dead indeed? Age. I'll take her off from this discourse, Lest she discover Clorinda in disguise. Dear Austella, in vain you strive to comfort him, That can know none, his Mistress dead. Au. Rather in vain I strive to know what both sir, Resolve to hide from me: It was not curiosity, But a desire to serve you: That belief Will speak my pardon. Exit. Age. I fear she is displeas'd. Clar. Reason hath too much power over her soul To be displeas'd without a cause: I hold her Every way so perfect, that I durst make A full discovery, crave her assistance; But then Clorinda would more justly hate. Age. O brother, speak no more of hate; it is impossible, If ever she did love me. You have my Intrust, But much more prevailing must your unequal'd merit Prove. Clar. Merit! dear brother, it is impossible: Since what I have done, or shall ever do, Grows from her influence upon me. Age. I see that I am yet to learn what it is To be a perfect Lover. Clar. Rather you have not practis'd what you know. Age. Brother, I must confess it is my shame, Though not my grief, since my inconstancie Hath made me but more happy. Clar. How! Age. Frown not: I mean more happy, As my inconstancie leaves you Clorinda free; And if she prove averse to your desires, Her constancie to me admits of a just censure, Not applause. Clar. If you believe you have a power in her After your breach of faith, such as may aid me In my love; she is not that perfection That I adore, and by such yielding Could not make me happy. Age. Then you propose a love without a possibility Of satisfaction. Clar. Yes, if it suit not with her excellence: The Gods sometimes appoint us such sad fates, That 'tis our duty to pursue and glory in our misery. Age: I see a miracle must make you happy: Be not displeas'd that I invoke the Deity In your behalf; and Brother, know that those Who would be held the most devout, Esteem things just and worthy, because they do Proceed from a divine power; not that they are Agreeing to our faith, or understanding. Clar. Brother, what you would undertake in my behalf Becomes your love to offer, but not mine to accept. A person truly humbled by sense of his unworthiness, Sure dares not hope: And to admit an Advocate, Supposes that; nay merit in himself, or in the Intercessor; or which is worse, an easiness To be overcome with words. Any of this Is such impiety my love cannot be guilty of: Her being his perfection, all things great or good, Clorinda nam'd, in that is understood. Exeunt. Enter Prince, and Olinda. Pr. Dear Lady, let me know how I have lost Your favour. Ol. First let me know why you believe you Ever had it? Pr. When I was here a suitor to your sister, You did not then look with such scorn upon me. Ol. Be so again to any other, and I will give you cause To think me every whit as kind. Here you discourse of Love; express a sense Of what you do profess to suffer by way of Martyrdom, perhaps accompanied with a sad sigh Or two. Pr. And can you yet be crueller? when you your self Have caus'd a nobler passion then what I made But shew of to Austela. Ol. It seems then you can counterfeit. Pr. I must confess; but yetâ Ol. Nay spare excuses: As I live, I like you the better For it; and if you love me now, know this to comfort you, We only can agree in being dissemblers. Offers to go. Enter Clorinda and Selina, (as in discourse.) Olind. Most noble sir! methinks my Genius Should have inform'd me the happiness of your approach; And yet 'tis fit I leave you now, But there does stay my best of wishes. Exit. Sel. She had like to have said, her heart: Alas poor Lady, how love does fool thee! Pr. It must be so; this stranger is the cause Of her neglect to me: With what unwillingness She parted from him! I will not, cannot suffer This second affront; I shall become the scorn Of all men. Exit, and justles Clorinda. Clo. What means this! But why, Selina, when I call'd, Came you not to help me? Sel. Alas, Madam, I was fast. Clo. Could you so quickly be so sound asleep? Sel. Weary with travel. But, Madam, what said Agenor, (The King I now must call him) when he perceived It was Lord Cleon, his trusted friend, That he had slain? Clo. He does not know it yet, nor ever shall: For since his passion to me procured his death, His faults be buried with him: Besides, I know It would have been no little torment to Agenor To find such falshood. Sel. Is it possible that you can yet consider him, Otherwise then to revenge his falshood? Clo. If thou hadst ever truly loved, Thou couldst not ask me such a question: Clarimant! I must not stay. Enter Clarimant. Clar. Sir, though you have hitherto found means to avoid me, Yet having now the opportunity, I needs must press you to a short discourse, And such a one as will require the absence Of your servant. Clo. I must obey necessity: Leave me. Sel. Is it possible he does not know her? Exit Sel. Clar. I see you wear a sword, and make no question But you know, or think you do, how to maintain With it the assertions of your tongue. Clo. In what? Clar. Is it possible that you can ask? yet since I must, I wil refresh your memory, and whet my own revenge By repetition. You, as a brother, did pretend You had more interest to right Clorinda's wrongs, Then I her servant. Clo. And proved it, did I not? Clar. In part the oratory of your tongue prevail'd, And I condemn'd my self; but honor forc'd me Make appeal unto my sword, and there you must Orecom me too, before I quit so dear a cause. [draws] Clo. Truth told me then, and bids me still maintain That I am most concern'd in what Clorinda suffers. [Draws too] Clar. Your resolution pleases above expression: Which forces me an enemy to beg the favour To kiss that hand, though it may prove to me An instrument of death. Clo. Keep off; I dare not trust a reconciled foe, Much less an enemy profest. Imploy your sword, Whose force I fear less then the impoison'd flattery Of your tongue. Clar: Then guard your self, your breast lies open. Clo. You shall not find it so, if you dare strike. Clar. Alas it is too true; you have a guard which I Can never force; and since invisible, it is fit I yield; Here to confess my self orecome, is to triumph. But if you hold your victory your shame, which much I fear, Then purge that stain with my heart-blood, A sacrifice most justly due to your disdain. Clo. A Cowards blood can have no vertue in it. [Offers to go] Clar. Stay. Clo. Imploy your sword then, and nobly take revenge Upon your enemy: I swear, that act Will with me raise you to the highest estimation: Clar. O Clorinda! that word pronounc'd, Think what you do enjoin me. Clo. I fear'd before you knew me, But thought it fitter to practise the masculine part I am to play, with you, then with another: Perhaps with some I have to do, where my Discovery is my ruine. Thus much, confident Of your esteem, I dare discover. Clar. What musick's in these words! Clo. Trust me, Prince Clarimant, I am much pleas'd To see you. Clar. Madam, assure me that I do not dream. Clo. Believe me every sense is free, Only your joy is too much rais'd. Clar. Too much! when you speak to me, and not in anger. Clo: Contain your self; for know 'tis in your power To make me happy. Clar. In mine! witness you God There is no bar betwixt you and your wish. Clo. None but your will. Clar. My will! That, and my other faculties Were ever yours. Clo. Swear it. Clar. By all that's sacred, it is and ever shall be so; For you can will nothing but what is just And noble. Clo. My will then is, to which yours must assent, That you do kill me. Clar. How! Clo. A miserable life consider'd, death is the happiness Opposed: That you must give me, or be perjur'd. Clar. That Clarimant should kill Clorinda! Self-murder is esteem'd the highest guilt, And yet this doubles it: I am deluded By some spirit; for what proportion Bears this imposition to your excellent sweetness? Clo: It bears proportion to my sorrows. Clar. Could death be granted as your only remedy, Yet that my hand should give it! Clo. Those servants are esteem'd the truest, That do the last and greatest offices of duty. Having no love to pay your vows of service, My gratitude proposed this as your recompence. Clar. O heavens! was ever gratitude so cruel! Clo. Will you not then obey me, nor your oath? Is this the fruit of all your protestations? Clar. Is not my will the same with yours? You would not live, nor I then. Clo. Kill me, and then do what you please. Clar. The same say I; kill me, and then do what you please: Clo. Your vow was not to eccho my desire, But to obey what I enjoind. Clar. It is true, in what was just and noble. Clo. Is it not so to relieve a friend distrest? Your oath past too? Clar. No friend will ask, for shame, That help he does refuse to give. Clo. The guilt remains with the first breach, and that was yours. Clar. Alas, you press what no example yet came near, To kill that person that I value more Then all the world. Clo. No doubt brave Brutus servant lov'd his Master; Yet kill'd him, being commanded. Clar. Perhaps he was his slave, and gain'd his Freedom by it. Clo. And shall not you do so? A freedom from the bonds Of Love, the Tyrant-master that I flie. But did not Herod Doom to death in one his Wife and Mistress, Lest any other should enjoy her? And this caused from excess of Love. Clar. Unto himself, as I dare never hope To be so happy to have his interest, So I shall never fear his punishment. [Kneels] This is that posture which my former vows Best suit withall: Nor am I humbled thus, To beg for pitty to my self but you, Divine Clorinda! who ought to be As far from thought of punishment, As you are free from guilt. Clo. False perjur'd man! I can be free from neither, Whilst I stay here: Clar. O misery! was ever man so wretched! In the performing what she should command, I still have plac'd my only hopes of merit, Sure fate did never yet to any Lover Put so hard a part, To disobey, or pierce his Mistress heart. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 2. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Austela, Clorinda. Au. Come sir, you must not be so sad: Sure there is some strange sympathie betwixt Prince Clarimant and you. Clo. No sympathie at all, if he have any cause Of grief; mine's meerly natural. Au. I find you dissemble with me: Your griefs have such resemblance, that knowing his Is Love, I am assured yours is the same. Clo. Love! I honour all the sex, yet never knew That passion for a woman. Au. I must confess that you have in your self So much of beauty, that looking in your glass, It is not like you should be taken with anothers form: But yet take heed, the Gods may punish pride. Clo. To be such, is a punishment so great, The Gods can add no more. Au. The interest you have in the King, hath made me Study your content: I find my sister loves you; And what her blushes will not let her speak, I must. Clo. If she herself should tell me so, it were fit for me To think she said it to make sport, knowing My own unworthiness. Au. How slow soever you are of belief, I must make known a Ladies passion to you Every way your equal. Clo. I have not seen that person, sure. Au. What do you think of me? Clo. You! as of the soul of all perfection, And only worthy him you do enjoy. Au. I must not think my beauty worth esteem: For, gaining him, there is a conquest, which obtain'd, Deserves a triumph. That blush shews you conceive me. Clo. Madam, it is impossible I should understand A speech so disagreeing to that character I had received. Au. It will be unjust to value me the less For my esteem of you. Clo: Of me! Enter Agenor. Au. Know, gentle Youth, not all the tyes of duty Have power to bar me the expressions of love, That grows from such perfections as the world Never knew: Hide not that lovely face, Which even the King beholding, must excuse me. Age. Thou lyest, false woman. Clo. O Agenor! I never wisht thee half so miserable. Au. Why do you turn away? What, weep! Is my love Such an injury? Or if some word have past my lips, That mov'd this passion, my lips shall satisfie By taking off these tears. Age. I can endure no more: Just heavens, how my inconstancie is punisht! Exit. Au. Clear up those Suns, and let them gently shine upon me, Or I am lost for ever! Not moved with all my Courtship, Continue thus unkind, insensible of a Queens love, And I shall think you are no man. Clor. The weakness of my passion hath discover'd me: Madam, such an excess of happiness To be thus favour'd by you, produc'd this passion; Tears are as well the effect of joy as sorrow. Au. A woman, I am confident! Now I can read it In her face, sir. I accept of your excuse, But then you must forgo this sadness. Clo. Madam, all other thoughts but the consideration Of your favour, are henceforth banisht. Au. I yet am something doubtful of your professions, You may confirm me. Clo. As how? Au. Sure you have a Mistress, some in the Court That you do love. Clo. None, trust me. Au. Then you do love the King so much, that you hate me For my inconstancie, you may forgive it, I know he will; He thinks it is no vice, rather a vertue, To have choice of Mistresses.âWhy do you sigh? This touches; nay, now you break your promise. Clo. Madam, I am not well. Au. Will you rest your self upon my bed? I'll call the King, then you will be well, It is he must cure you, Lady. Clo. Lady! O my heartâ [Swoons] Au. What have I done? ho, some Cordial quickly! Helpâ Enter two Women. Madam, he recovers. Au. Lay him upon my bed, gently for heavens sake! Exit woman and Clor: In this discovery I my end obtain, But make provision for my future pain. Such fruit our jealousie produces still: Better not know, then know the worst of ill. Exit: Enter Clindor and a Gentleman. Clind. Pray you sir, shall I make bold to ask a question? Gent. A dozen, if you please. Clind. You are courteous. Why was the King sent for by the Queen in such haste? Gent. I must not tell you that. Clind. Perhaps you cannot. Gent. I cannot, sir, be ignorant. Clind. O, wondrous easie; perhaps the King knew not The cause himself. Gent. It may be so; Kings know not all things. Clind. You do, it seems. Gent. Seem, sir! Clind. Nay, be not angry; you promis'd largely. Gent. I promis'd nothing. Clind. 'Tis true; and nothing I expect. So fare you well. Gent. Remember, sir, I only gave you leave to ask. Clind. 'Tis true, I cry you mercy: Then I may ask one question more. Gent. You may ask any thing. Clind. Do you not think I had ill luck To find a man so overwise for my Informer. Gent. Troth sirâ Clind. You need not answer, I am already Satisfied. Gent. I see you know not me, You are a shallow fellow. Clind. And you so deep a puddle, No plummet can find the bottom; You have no ground, sir: So fare you well, My cautious Monsieur. Exeunt: Enter Agenor and Clorinda. Age. O dear Clorinda! how powerfully thy beauties Now present themselves, and every minute gather strength By these thy sufferings! What cause hast thou and I To curse my base inconstancie? Clo. How sir! are you so ingrate to heaven, That for your sake favour'd that vice so far, To give it the reward of vertue, happiness? And that so great in your Austela, That all men else are poor compared. Enter Austela. Age. My Austela! Au: It is well I am denied then: Age. Did she not court you as a man? The heart she took from me, though you could not Receive, your sex denying Entertain, Is yet so tainted in the tender of it, That I for ever must repent the change I made: O Clorinda! would this hand When it was join'd in hers, had rotted off. Clo. Do you believe to cure inconstancie And breach of faith, by new inconstancie? I see it was a vice dwelt in your blood. Age. It is no inconstancie, to cast an eye back On your vertue, too late instructed By present misery. Clo. It is enough; this does express how miserable You might have been: But know your happiness is perfect. The Queen prompted by jealousie, the fruit of Ardent love, suspected me a woman, And your former Mistress, and took this way of courting me To be assured. Age. Your vertue bids you make this fair construction. [Ent. Austel.] Clo. She comes! her sight begets new trouble; Would I had chang'd this habit for my winding-sheet. Au. Sir, I am glad to find my chamber can afford you So good company. Clo. Absence at any rate! I must be gone: Your Majesties pardon. Exit. Au. It seems you have cured him. Age: You made him sick; had I not reason? It is fit I remedy your errors. Au. You have so many of your own, It will take your time up. Age. But there's one especially that troubles me. Au. You would change a wife, would you not? Age. Do your thoughts prompt you to that question? Au. It is time when you deny me. Age. There was a time I might. Au. Had your hand rotted off, the present trouble Had been saved: You are an unconstant man; Which granted, both are miserable. Age. Both are no less in being jealous, Which you must grant you are. Au. Having such cause, love could not be without it. Age. But having certainty that vertue is gone, Love ceasing ends that trouble. Au. The object of our guilt, shall be our Judge. Age: I doe not understand your riddle: who do you mean? Au. One, that to me cannot be partiall: your Mistress. Age. Your servant. Au. Yes, Clorinda. Age. But doe you think that you stand clear in honor. Au. You cannot hope it sure; but there's the more For me to pardon: Come, all your passages of love Are plain; yours, and your brother Clarimants. Perswade Clorinda that I think her still a man, Lest modesty make her forsake the Court, And both use means to make her love your brother. These little quarrels, where the hearts are good, The body of our Love keeps firm, like letting blood. Enter Clindor, and 1. 1. Come. thou shalt lend me ten Crowns; As I am an honest man, Ile pay thee. Clind. Gain that opinion with me first: You see the Money's ready. 1. Why, thou hast known me long, Did I ever deceive thee. Clind. No, for I ever took thee for a Shark: A Fellow too, that would abuse me In my poverty, in words. 1: It was but in Merriment; I swear I ever Loved thee truly. Clind. Yes, and I will requite it; I know that mony Would but dull your Wit, spoil Industry: I finde it by my self, that care keeps close My Purse. 1. Refuse a Comrade a little Coyn: 'Tis poor. Clind. But yet the custome of the Rich, and things Must be proportion'd to our Fortune. 1. 'Tis well Fortune and you are friends; That makes you proud. Clind. I have a sense of her great benefits, I were a Fool else. 1. Well! I may live to repay this scorn. Clind. Yes, sooner then the Money you would borrow; Which makes me ask no Bond. 1. Come, prethee supply me, and leave fooling. Clind. Spare your own pains, Sir, you have done enough. 1: As I am clad, I am not fit for any honest company. Clind. Nor cloath'd in Scarlet trust me. 1. You are a base Fellow: the Tide may turn. Clind. O admirable fruit of poverty! Valour infus'd I vow: Yet remember, Friend, quarrels are dangerous. 1. Tell me of dangerâ Clind. I cry you mercy, Sir; I had forgot you were poor. Nay, if you be outragious, I must leave you. 1. We shall meet agen. Exit. Clind. Yes, no doubt on't; how calm and temperate Will Money make one: a man might almost pull me By the Nose, yet I not angry; such admirable satisfactions Here.â [Enter Selina] This Youth I have seen oft, had a strange Mind to talk to him; yet still the brat avoids me. Stay my pretty knave, shall I borrow a word or two? Sel. On good security you will ask no more. Clind. Why is your Mistress staying for you in the Lobby? Sel. If she were, what would you give to supply my room? Clind. I do believe what ever it were, she would repay the sum. Sel: O fie! you look not like an Amorist; that face would fright her. Clind. A martial one: Adonis was not alwayes favourite, Mars had his turn. Sel. Were you that Deity? your reign is out. Clind. But I can prove a Jupiter, and court your Mistress in a shower Of gold; and that, I take it, in all times is powerful More then your face. Sel. Descend, descend, and shew yourself a simple Mortal, Else I shall leave you. Clind. Tell me first what Country you are of; My mind gives me I have seen that face. Sel. You have a foolish mind that does abuse you, So fare you well. Clind. And so have you a foolish tongue that does betray you; A certain coy disdainful look too, that stiles you woman. Sel. How sir! you shall find me masculine; take that. [Strikes him] Clind. This cannot hide you; confess your sex and name, Or by this light I will untruss your points, And then you know what follows. Sel. Sir, you in this restraint preserve my modesty, It was my desire that you should know me: I dare not say you are the cause of this disguise, Yet you may think your pleasure. Clind. Now by this light have I mind to beat thee As a man, for all the scorns thou hast put upon me: For as a woman I am sure thou wilt abuse me, Especially if thou pretend'st to love me. Sel. Your scorn's so just, that I must suffer it: [Seems to weep] Clind. How! let's see; no moisture! spare, spare your Linen, good Selina. Sel. Oh whither shall I flie to hide my shame! Clind. Ev'n to your mask and petticoat: Carry your bum A little out, you will need no Fardingale a while. Sel. Alas sir you mistake, I have no other burden But my sorrows; from those you only can deliver me. Clind. Bar marriage, and I will be your midwife: Where lie you? Sel. As you have honour in you, do not discover me, Hereafter you shall know. Exit Clindor. Enter Clorinda (with a paper) and Olinda. Clo. Madam, having received such testimonies Of your favor, I could not leave the Court Even in civility, till I had kist your fair hand. Olind. What sad things do you utter! It is not possible, You do but fright me sure. Clo. Necessity enforces; for I shall leave behind That which I value far above my self. Olin. Does the King and Queen know what you do intend? Clo. They must not. Olin. Your resolution is full of cruelty; That though you do oblige me by imparting it, Yet I must fail your trust, and give them notice. Clo. For your own sake you must not: this paper, I being gone, will let you know a secret That concerns your happiness, and by my stay You will be miserable. Olin. Alas, that is impossible: To have your company, includes all joys. Clo. Since you esteem it so, if I live I will return. Olin. How soon? Clo. In a short time; but if you read this paper Yet this two days, when I come back you have my curse. Weep not dear Lady, yield me the honor Of your hand. [Enter Prince] Ol. O me most wretched! you shall not go, I die if you thus leave me. Clo. Alas I must. Pr. Madam, I cannot chuse but wonder To see you court a Boy thus. Ol. My wonder is greater at your arrogance And ignorance, to tutor me, and slight a person Then your self more worthy. Pr. What's this? Clo. From him I may receive that death I seek: Defend your self. Ol. Ah me! help, help! oh help Prince Clarimant, The gentle Youth is hurt. Enter Clarimant. Clar. Hurt! O heavens, grant me a little space. Clar. fights with the Prince, beats him off, returns wounded, and kneels to Clorinda. Clo. Why this to me? Clar. To ask your pardon, that he lives That drew that precious blood. Clo. I grieve your hurt, yet thank you not for interposing. Enter Agenor and Attendants. My Brother wounded! speak, by whom? A Surgeon, quick. Sel. The Prince of Aquitain. Age. Make after, seise him: Dear Clarimant, how is it with you? Clar. Well; happy to die for such a cause. Au. You Gods extend your pity: O dear Clorinda! Pour some balm into his wounds. Age. One word from you may clear his fainting spirits. Clo. Heaven knows I wish his life more then mine own. Age. We must do more then wish. Clar. Although my reason tels me that I owe my thanks To your despair, yet the sound comforts me: O there bestow your cure! my cure lies there. Au. Thou soul of Lovers, in thee dwels such truth, Well may thy merit save our faithless Youth. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 3. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter King, Agenor. Age. Is there no news? what is become of this rude Prince? K. You need not seek for him; his wounds and his disgrace Are punishment enough. Age. My reason now does tell me so; but had my brothers Wounds prov'd mortal, no corner of the earth Should hide him from my revenge. K. I cannot chuse but grieve the sad accident; Yet know I am oblig'd in honor, he coming To my rescue with such a powerful Flees, To look with less severity upon his fault: Besides, which happily you know not, I gave him leave to be a suiter to my daughter. Age. His punishment would be so great to see Clorinda, As herself whom he would then have wounded As his rival, that I confess I wish him here. Besides, those of his Fleet, or he scaping to That, may do some sudden mischief. K. He cannot be so base, your fears are needless. Exeunt: Enter Clorinda and Austela. Clo. Madam, in modesty I could no longer Wear the habit of a man, once known a woman: But humbly I beseech you on my knees, As you respect the honor of our sex, When you return, to licence my departure From the Court; since misery and discontent Dwels here, though I were circled in With all those honors you or the King can grant. Aust. I must confess I am made happy by your misery, And therefore hold my self oblig'd to study always For your satisfaction. But know, besides this tye, I have so great opinion of your merit, Hold it so far to exceed mine, that I am confident The Gods reserve for you a greater blessing then Agenor, A person tainted in his faith. Clo. Although your own, I must not suffer Such an undervalue of the King, whose worth is such, So far exceeding all, that it admits of an allay. Here it was not so, rather addition; A change produc'd by such perfection, Is not to be esteem'd inconstancie, but wisdom: Au. It is not now, rather hereafter that I shall return This argument upon your self: Now let us go do What charity enjoins. Clo. That and my duty forces me to attend you. Exeunt. Enter Clarimant and Clindor. Clind. How is it with your Highness? Clar. O too well, Clindor: my outward wounds Heal much too fast, since these within do fester. Clind. Well sir, you little know what service I may do you. Clar. I know thou hast and wilt be careful of my health. Cli. But sir, I mean that I can serve you in your love. Clar. O Clindor, speak no more; thou troublest me. Clind. Will it trouble you to let you know Clorinda's here? Clar. Here! where? Clind. Not in this room, but in this Country, nay in this Court. Clar. Alas I know it, and so by this does all men. Clind. But do they know Selina's here in habit of a man? Clar. Yes, yes. Clind. But yet they do not know she is in love with me, Most desperately too. Clar. Nor dost thou know it, fool, she does abuse thee. Enter two Surgeons. Clind. She dares not; by this light I will beat her.â The Surgeons, sir, are come to dress you. Clar. Must I be drest? Enter Austela, Clorinda, and Olinda. Clind. The Queen your sister! Clorinda, as I live, sir. Clar. O fool, thou lyest; it is impossibleâCan it be she? Au. Brother, how is with you now? Clar. So well, that I could kiss that sword that made these Wounds; for I by them receive a benefit Which I durst never hope. Au. Come, I must dress your wounds; no common hand Is fit to touch you. I know this Lady will apply One plaister, since for her sake you did receive These wounds. Clo. Led by your example, I am compell'd to follow. Clar. You Gods, what happiness is this! may they be long A healing, if still this application will continue. Au. Pray not against your self, heaven is offended, Granting your request, I fear; for if I not mistake, They bleed afresh. Fair Clorinda, These drops express his passion, and your power. Clo. I grieve for both, and know no remedy so good As a perpetual absence. Clar. Know dear Clorinda, it was a thankful heart That sent those few drops forth to kiss your hand For so great favours: your cruel resolution Sends them back, their errand scarce perform'd: For see, I bleed no more; but know withall 'Tis the destruction of the fountain; the coldness Of despair must quickly freeze all motion: Au. I owe a reverence to that blood upon this hand; O let me kiss it as a most sacred relique Of the truest Lover the sex did ever boast. That spot, Clorinda, you may wipe away, Offers to weep. But never shall the memory of him Whom you thus cruelly do murder By disdain. Clo. Madam, free from that guilt, I cannot apprehend A punishment. The Gods are just; they be my witness If I had happiness to give, I should prefer This Prince before my self; But I am such a peece Of earth, so sunk beneath all joys, That should I yield what he can ask, Yet I must lie like lead upon his heart. Au. Yet for the present, sure, It is fit you speak comfort to him. Clo. Comfort from me! 'tis contradiction To my being, who am made up of misery. Au. Pray come near, and speak to him. Clo. I am so careful, that I would not hurt him. Au. Brother, be confident her rigor cannot last, I shall perswade her to relent. Clar. O Madam, you mistake; she only hath the beauties, And not the weaknesses usually depending on her sex: Her resolutions have their ground from reason ever, And know no change till it command. How can she then esteem the less deserving brother Worthy her love, when he that most deserved Foully betraid her? Life could only prove No curse, if I might be assur'd she would Forgive the injury she suffers by the trouble Of my love; to hope her pitty of my torments, Is much above my faith. Clo. Madam, too long we have disturb'd the Prince; Our absence would be more conducing to his health. Au. There is a care his merits methinks should command Over your gratitude: which that you not apply, Too late you may repent. Clo. I so much wish his health and happiness, That I will ever pray that he may never find Disquiet thought, and to my prayers likewise add My latest counsel: Forget Clorinda, and make her happy. Clar. Forget Clorinda, and make her happy! How can I understand this cruel sentence? Au. Waste not your spirits, sir; I think I understand her, And it shall not be long ere I procure her To explain herself. Clar. You are the comfort of my love, and life. Exeunt. Enter Prince Cleon. Pr. What do I owe my stars that did direct me To this place, where I find safety for my person, Cure for my wounds, and such a friend who chalks me Out a way to all I can desire on earth! Cle. Follow my counsel, and be constant in it, You are the master of your wish Pr. Constant! can there be other ends propos'd Powerful to change me? Revenge for my disgrace; And the possession of that Kingdom I aim'd at In Austela, now to prove mine with one I more esteem, The fair Olinda. But how when this is done, I ever can requite your pains? Cle. It pays it self; and to secure you more Of my intention and performance, Know I am not the man I have appeared, But one whom both revenge and love does likewise Animate.â [Enter Druid.] My Instrument returns: When we have heard what's his intelligence, I will lay my self more fully open, And we'll conclude how to pursue what we design. What is thy news, good? Druid. As you could wish. Cle. We'll hear't within. Exeunt. Enter Clorinda and Selina: Clo. A man so holy and so knowing, sayst thou, That can give comforts to all griefs, Call back the peace that is fled from any mind? Sel. Certainly, Madam, the spirit of the Gods Dwels in him, or rather he is a God descended To the earth to comfort the distressed world: I am confident, had you but once discours'd with him, You would not be thus sad. Clo. O fool! the Gods themselves have not a cure for me But death: If he their substitute would give me that, Then I would visit him most gladly. Prethee leave me. Sel. Well Madam, I grieve you have not faith To trust my words. My words! nay, all the City Speaks him wonderful for sanctity and knowledg. Clo: Well, perhaps I will see him: Prethee now leave me. Sel. Alas Madam, I cannot, whilst you are thus sad. Clo. I am not so, thou but deceivest thy self; Or if I be, company makes me worse. Sel. Madam, since I must, yet still my duty Presses you to receive this comfort. Clo. Well, be gone, I will think on it. Ex. Selina. Why do I trifle time out thus, when every hour I feel a torment more then death can be? Besides, if I were gone; from the impossibility To enjoy me, Prince Clarimants affection Might abate; and yet when I consider, His love appears none of those sickly passions Which time can triumph over, since I believe it such, Where is my gratitude to see him languish? Nay, to see him die? die of those wounds That he for me received? I never can forget His blood fresh streaming from his wounds At my approach; that faithful witness of his joy, More worthy of belief, then if a thousand tongues Or pens should be imployed: I find my self More wretched now then ever, fitter to die; For if I live, I to my own shall add His sufferings too: And yet methinks that should be Pleasing: To grieve for him, is to discharge Part of that debt I owe; I would not be ungrateful: Live then Clorinda, till thou find'st some way To make him happy. No, it is impossible, Since I cannot be so; yet I may seem content, And by that seeming give him real blessing: And see, fortune presents an object that confirms my hopes It may be done, at least I will endeavour. Enter Olinda. Olind. Dearest Clorinda! not less dear, because a woman; For such perfections in a man I solely could not Have possest, my own defects barring that happiness: But as a woman sure, none can pretend With greater merit to your favour; All my wants supplied by my firm love, Which cannot know another object then your fair self. Clo. I must esteem my self most happy In the continuance of your love, Rather your friendship; for all affection Is from us proper to the better sex. Olind. Which sure is ours, you being a woman. Clo. Your sister will not grant you that, Whose example you ought to follow, in acknowledging Love and superiority due to the men, Especially such men as the King Agenor And his more worthy brother Clarimant. Olind. These words of Clarimant, if heard, Would cause a general joy through all the Court: But he himself must know his happiness by degrees, Lest the excess again disturb his health; Since your last visit he is miraculously recover'd. Clo. You attribute to me what is more justly due Unto the King and Queen's, nay your sweet conversation. Methinks you four would be most aptly join'd; Two brothers and two sisters, whose perfections All the world cannot equal. Olind. Dear Clorinda, I must not understand you; Or if I do, you have a mean opinion Of my Judgment, less of my Constancie, Which did but now profess my heart for ever only yours: Clo. I take for granted that your heart is mine, Which I express in that I would dispose it, And so I would do my own, if I had any: But know that what I once do give, I never reassume; Or if I had a heart, could that be worthy Clarimant Another had despised? Olind. What now you speak to me, expresses your respect to him, And so must not displease; for I confess His merits are so great, that in his happiness All that love vertue must be sharers: But I beseech you do not entertain a thought That you can breed a change in him or me. Dear Clorinda, your vertue and your beauty Is the object of our Loves; such a conformity As may arise from that, betwixt Prince Clarimant And me, is only fit. Clo. I for my part do ask no more, but that your lines Of love do meet in me: But reason in him, Friendship in you may give me power in time To tie a happy knot; this hope the Gods inspire me with. Olind. Take heed, they needs must be offended with you For a hope that is so unjust. Clo. Dare you refer your self unto their sentence? Olind. I dare do any thing that you think fit; But this I know you cannot. Clo. Heaven knows that I desire it. Olind. But do not hope it, when two wills oppose you. Clo. Yet when the Gods shall give their sentence, Your will and Clarimant's, if all your vows be true, Must then submit to mine. Olind. Should we grant our obedience, how have the Gods, Or can they unto us declare their will? Clo. That great Deity that did infuse A reasonable soul into us mortals, Inthron'd that Reason as a King to govern All our actions. But beyond this I am inform'd, Nor is it possible but you must know it, That here without the City in a sacred Grove, There lives a man so pious, and so knowing The will of heaven, that all men in distress Or doubt repair to him, and find a happy issue Of their troubles. Olind. It is most true, his fame is great: If curiosity do move you to go visit him, I gladly will attend you; but since I have resisted What you commanded, dear Clorinda, No mortal man must change me. Clo. I love this firmness in you; the fitter you Will prove hereafter for Clarimants affection. In hearts of wax, Love easily impressions make, But those of diamonds hardly new forms take. Exeunt. Enter Agenor and Clindor. Age. Clindor, I make no doubt your joy is not the least To see your Master thus recover'd of his wounds. Clind. Faith sir, his outward wounds are pretty well; But there's a foolish shaft sticks in his heart. The little Archer should be whipt for shooting Soldiers, What has he to do with us? Age. He aims still at the noblest marks. Clind. But those, sir, that are wise, wear privy coats, And then his darts prove but burbolts, and drop down At our feet: And is not that, sir, better then by our whining Or in verse or prose, make these she-gossips think themselves Our Deities, who by creation rather are our slaves. Age. I see thou art an enemy to Love. Clind. Just as to Idleness: why are we not in arms? Methinks there is now a brave occasion. Age. How? we have no enemies. Clind. Let's make some then: But sir, you have a cause Of just revenge against that base Prince which hurt your Brother: Let's fall upon his Country, they say a rich one, And he no doubt lies here obscured to do some mischief: At least let us seise upon his ships here in the road. Age. It were dishonorable: He came to the assistance of the King my father, And for his sake I rather do desire his friendship, However he appears not to receive it. Clind. That shews his hatred; he may be in his Country Raising forces to invade your Kingdom in your absence: Prevent him sir, and seise on his; it is a shame, sir, To lie here hugging a wife, wasting your best of youth On poor delights. Age. Thou knowst not what it is to be rich in pleasure. Clind. Yes, to have mony purchas'd by my sword. Age. Is it not as well to have it without blows? Clind. Not by the half: If your Majesty should give me now A thousand crowns, in the mind I am in, I swear I scarce would give you thanks for it. Age. Well Clindor, I had such an intention; but since I see It will be no more acceptable, it shall be reserv'd for some other. Clind. Your Majesty, if you please, may lend me such a sum: At the first City taken by assault, I shall pay it. Age. The war is so distant from my thoughts, So long I cannot spare it. Clind. Nay, as you please sir, I am full. Age. Able to lend me, are you not? I am a stranger here, And may need gold. Clind. Make haste, sir, back to Burgonia, your credit's good there: And to say truth, I wonder why you stay so long; Your subjects will believe you have forgot them, Your fathers death, sir, left things much unsetled. Age. Clindor, I thank you for your care; 'tis worth my thought, And shall be worth to you the thousand crowns we spake of, Nor shall you pay so much as thanks to me: Only be careful of my brother; he is full of melancholy, For which I know no better cure then your company. Clind. He shall not stir a foot without me: But this same foolish Love does trouble us; A little Bout, sir, In the field, War, war would cure us all. Exeunt. Enter Clarimant and Clorinda. Clar. Divine Clorinda! how quickly is my joy To see you here, lost by the cruelty of your commands! All your neglect was just; but now to bid me Cease to love you, nay to impose a new affection, It is such a studied tyrannie, that I in this particular To Gods and men may justifie my disobedience To Clorinda. Clo. I must not hope that any argument That I have used can be of equal force With her perfections; if they want power, 'Tis vain to plead it further: but henceforth Be assured I never shall impose any command Upon you, nor will I ever see you more, If with convenience I may avoid you. Clar. Stay, you cannot think it is possible I should obey you. Clo. I think you will not rather; so fare you well. Clar. O stay! was ever man so wretched? May I not be allowed some time to try If I can be unconstant? Clo. Yes. Clar. How long? Clo. Two or three days. Clar. Oh! years, years will not do it, sure not an age, I cannot suffer such a thought: To pierce my heart Is much more easie; O give me leave to do that Rather; then you shall see your character So deeply printed there, that not Clorinda's self Can ere deface it, not by this injury, Although the greatest that ever yet was offer'd To a faithful love. Clo. Tears from those manly eyes! it is not fit I urge it more: But know withall it is impiety in you To hope I ever can be yours: For though no contract past betwixt me And the King your brother, I hold my self Unfit to be anothers wife; my vows of being Ever his, are sure in heaven recorded. Think seriously of this; but withall be assured That person does not live to whom I hold My self so much obliged as to Prince Clarimant: The Gods grant you much peace, Nay greater happiness then they permit me to bestow. Exit Clo. Clar. Thunder and musick in one voice; despair and joy! Yet reason bids me hope from her last word: The heart that pitties once, may love afford. Exit. Enter Clorinda, Selina. Clo. Selina, I am now resolved to see this Holy man; and if he be what you relate, Hereafter I shall credit you. Prince Clarimant And fair Olinda too will go along: Let it be order'd so, if possible, That none take notice of our going. Sel. That may with much ease be effected: Some houres As in the morning he wholly dedicates To his devotions, and does admit of none to visit him: But persons of your quality are not obliged to any rule. Clo. It fals out happily; be ready then to guide us. Sel. Madam, I shall not fail; and if you find him not above What you expect, for ever banish me your favor. Exeunt. Enter King, Austela. K. Austela, I much wonder why this Unhappy Prince appears not. Au. Doubtless, sir, he is shipt; the sense of his disgrace Will hinder him for ever appearing in this Court. K. Why should you think so? his action was not such As you would make it; although Clorinda Were a woman, he knew it not, but as a rival In your sisters love did wound her. Au. That is true, sir; it is not that which I alleadg In his disgrace, but that he with such odds Could not defend himself from Clarimant. K. It was his misfortune, and not want of courage, Nor can I think that he consented To that assistance which his servants gave: However I must value him a friend, For such he shewed himself in my distress; Nor shall he suffer in my Kingdom, if it lie In my power to serve him. Au. I am not, sir, to counsel you: but for my part The little knowledg I had of him, does make me wish Never to see my sister married to him; And I am confident, if not inforc'd, She never will receive him for a husband. K. It is not come to that: I rather fear His wounds were mortal; and should he thus be lost And no accompt given of his life or death, It might be prejudicial to my honor, All neighbour Princes would avoid my Court for ever. Au. It were no loss, if they were all like him. K. Daughter, I find you are so partial for your Husbands brother, that you forget my interest quite: Au. I cannot be so severed by a husband, As to forget a loving father: My sisters good Obliges to speak thus much, for whom I must believe Prince Clarimant would prove A nobler husband then this Prince You so much seem to favour. K. It is true; but his affection's setled on Clorinda sure, Never to be altered. Au. You know not, sir, what time may do; Clorinda's self labours to make Prince Clarimant Change his affection to my sister: For her, She vows never to marry, as having lost Agenor Whom she loved. This I both gather by mine Own observance, and likewise know it from my sister, To whom Clorinda hath in part exprest as much. K: Things standing so, I must confess, if honor And my word engag'd permit, I quickly should consent. Au. You would have reason. I know Agenor So much loves his brother, that he might be perswaded After your death to live here, and leave the government Of Burgonia to Clarimant. K. It were a high point of state, could it be so, And we should aptly pay the care we owe Unto this Kingdom. That State is much more happy Where the Prince himself remains. Then howsoever govern'd by a Substitute. Au. Add to this, what happiness it were for me To live here in that Kingdom, which I By your favour brought my husband. K. My dear Austela, I rejoice in thy instruction: My daughter and my Tutor, to thy cleer Judgment I leave the managing of this affair. Exeunt. Enter Cleon and Druid. Dru. Will you not let them see my art? Cle. No, no, it were loss of time. Pr. On peril of your lives keep close, till you be call'd. Enter Prince and Sailors. Cle. Speak not of calling; As soon as you perceive them once entred This thicket, break forth and seise them: If any men come in their company, Unless they yield, kill them; whilst we convey Away the Ladies to the ship. Where lies the Boat? Who guides to that? Sail. Fast by here in a Creek. Pr. But why should I not we rather let them come Unto his Cell? then we might better seise them. Cle. Oh by no means! he must remain here still In the same reputation, untill by poison Or some other way the King Agenor be dispatcht; And then come to receive a Dukedom For thy recompence,âor else a halter. Dru. Doubt not, I will deserve it. Pr. My mind misgives me that they will not come. Cle. Oh fear it not; both love and curiosity. Advance their steps, either of which Hath power to make young people run: The boy that brings them, hath his interest too. I judge it near the time. [Ent. Sailor] I see them coming. Cle. Stand close. Enter Selina, Clorinda, Clarimant, Olinda, Clindor. Sel. Madam, it is but a little farther Within the Wood. Clind. Whilst they enquire for Oracles, I'll talk with you: It is a notable witty rogueâ The place methinks invites: [Ent. Sailors] Clar. Traitors! Clo. Help, help, you Gods! Pr. Make good 'gainst them. Cle. Lose no time. [Ex. Pr. Cle. Clor. Olind.] Enter Clarimant and Clindor. Clar. O Clindor, that we had wings! In the fight Sailors are kill'd. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 4. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter King, Agenor, Austela, and Attendants. K. 'Tis strange that they should be so long returning, It is not a mile without the City. Age. It seems they find a pleasing entertainment. Enter Clindor (wounded) Au. O my heart! what object's this! Age. Clindor, what mean these wounds? Clind. To kill me, sir, I think; and if they do, It matters not, life hath with me no value: Your Brother's lost. Age. How lost? Clind. Surpris'd by the base Prince of Aquitain, As they were going to see the holy Druid. Au. O heavens! and whither carried? Clind. To his Fleet that lies here in the Road. Prince Clarimant and I, when we had kill'd Those that opposed us, pursued to overtake them, But came just as they put their Barge from shore: The Prince not considering his wounds, Transported by his passion, leaps into the sea, And swam after the Boat; but you may think In vain, although he could have reacht it. Age. And so was drown'd! Clind. Not drown'd, but perhaps worse: Whether moved by the Ladies prayers, or that they might not Lose the profit of his ransom, or with more cruelty To make an end of him, I know not which; I saw them take him up into the Boat, Having disarm'd him first. Age. He's lost, he's lost! Just Gods grant me revenge upon the Traitor, And after punish me which way you please for all my ills. Clind. The hope of that revenge is my excuse to outlive My master: Think what you are to do. Age. Thou counsell'st well. O sir, your help! what is to be done? K. I am so distracted with the accidentâ Age. Lend me your power. K. Most willingly. Age. Furnish such ships with all speed possible As are not so; such as be ready, clap men aboard Them strait: For me, were there but one, By all the Gods, with that I will attempt their rescue. Au. Then I must go along. Age. You! Au. Yes, I. Age. Let some watch on the shore, and see if the Admiral Hoise sail, what course he holds. 1. That shall be my imployment; but be assured sir, Whilst the wind keeps where it is, They cannot pass into the Main. K.; Age. Continue good heaven, and grant your aid! Exeunt. Enter Cleon: Fortune! thou enemy to wit and industry, How I could curse thy deity, and this same giddy Prince, That by his new affection gives thee power To ruine my well-laid plots! But I unjustly Do complain of both: Clorinda's beauty Is my fate, all my disasters take from her Their being; I will forget her, tear her from my heart: But then I overthrow the groundwork Of my great design; no Kingdom, Nor no happiness without Clorinda. Enter Selina. Sel. How! no happiness without Clorinda! Cle. No happiness without Clorinda dye, You know her title to the Crown of Burgonia Takes place of mine. Sel. And why then does she live? Cle. It is a question I may better ask, I gave you poison to dispatch her. Sel. Rather a Cordial to comfort her,âsee, I dare take the rest. Cle. Hold, dear Selina! Sel. Dear Selina! False perjur'd man, have I from love To thee, attempted wickedness so great, That horror strikes my soul to think upon it; And after all cast off like a scorn'd property, Your work perform'd? Cle. This jealousie does set a greater value on thee: Come, I will open to thee all my heart; To make my title strong, I must be married To Clorinda. Sel. You must! Cle. Hear me with patience, I mean in policie it were fit: But to secure your fears, before that pass, The Priest shall secretly joyn us together, Which disanuls a second marriage. Sel. If this be real that you speak, Perform it now betwixt our selves, And call the Gods to witness. Cle. Our hearts already have consented, What needs there more? Sel. Is it even so; I left nothing undone To the last circumstance, that you desired; Gave Clarimant, Clorinda, and the Princess Olinda into your hands. But I perceive Where your heart's fixt, and I was strangely fool'd, That ever could believe again. Cle. I like not this, dear Selina, If you consider well, you have no ground For jealousie from me. The Prince, within whose power We for the present are, neglects his former Mistress, Makes all addresses, in my judgment, to Clorinda. Sel. In this you more confirm me, that you still Do love Clorinda: since jealousie makes you Imagine that for which there is no ground; Or if this Prince like you should prove unfaithful, Can it be thought Clorinda can be moved To love again, that had no sense of all Prince Clarimant hath done or suffer'd for her sake? Cle. But she is within his power; and what time Or force may work! nay, if you will observe, You'll find she shews no great a version to him. Sel. Lend me your eyes, I cannot see it else: Cle. No more; be confident, Selina, I am what I was: Sel. Yes, I am confident, False as the Fiends, too late I find it. Enter Prince, Clorinda, Olinda, Attendants. Pr. Most noble Cleon! Clo. Ha! Cleon? Pr. Lend me your help, to let these Ladies know Nothing but service is intended. Cle. What mean you sir? she must not know me. Clo. Cleon: Did you not call him Cleon? Pr. No, Madam: Clo. Sure you did: Pr. Then I mistook. Cle. Cleander is my name, a servant to your beauty Lady, and this fair Princess; whose merits Are so great, that by your selves consider'd, May well assure of all observance, Especially from this noble Prince your servant. Clo. I must confess sir, I believe him every way So worthy, that I much grieve fortune allotted Him no other way then force to gain Possession of his Mistress. Come, Madam, be not sad; A noble husband makes a large amends For loss of friends or country; nor are they lost But for the present. Olind. I know not how (Clorinda) you may value him; But I must tell him plainly, his actions Speak him base and treacherous. Pr. Madam, I shall not so much grieve to find you Cruel; since this fair Lady not condemns me. Clo: You shall in nothing, sir, oblige me more, Then by your using Clarimant with courtesie: Although your enemy, he is my friend; A nearer interest tho' he most deservingly Hath sought, my inclination never could allow him. Pr. I shall forget my wounds receiv'd from him; Neglect all opportunity to take revenge, If it may be to you a satisfaction. Clo. Your noble usage of him whilst he is your prisoner, At last may turn to your advantage: Your peace will be the easier made with both the Kings; Nay, without doubt this fair Princess Would easily be granted to you In exchange for him. Olind. Me in exchange! first I will be wedded to my grave. Pr. Lady, I shall not press you much: Your pride and scorn darkens your beauty, Whilst courtesie sets off what in this Lady Needs no foil. Cle. It is so. Clo. I see you are a Courtier, sir, and know how To oblige those who have power to assist your wishes: Your favorable opinion of me, engages my Best performance with my dearest friend To make her yours; this coyness shall not last, Leave me to win her for you. Pr. If you be pleas'd to hold me worthy, I shall not Study to maintain a meaner happiness. Cle. He is taken past recovery. Pr. Ladies, we dare not longer bar you The happiness to enjoy your selves. Dispose of all things freely in this ship, Were it the Empire of the world, most Excellent Clorinda, your power were still the same. Clo. I know you borrow but my name, The power intended here; and so she must Conceive it. Pr. Sir, let me crave some conference with you: Cle. Command that boy straight from them, As you respect your happiness: I'll give you reason for it. [Ex. Princes, Cleon] Sel. O Madam! [Whispers] 1. Sir, you must go with me. Sel. What mean you? 1. The Prince would speak with you. Exeunt. Enter Clarimant. Can I yet live, and know Clorinda prisoner, Subject to all the injuries of power, And I incapable to serve her? I am not so; My hands are free, only my heart is slaved Under misfortune. Were my love such as justly Might arise from so miraculous a cause, The ardor of my flame would prompt my heart And hand to find some way to set her free, And take revenge upon the treacherous Prince. But I do find the cause of all this deadness: My thoughts are active, but there wants Her favorable influence upon me. O me! what do my fears suggest! My eyes and ears, those traitors to my peace, I will not trust your base intelligence; You are but the servants of my fear, and not my reason: Can injuries or importunity prevail To make her love this Prince; where love and service On my part procured but frowns? O yes, It may be so; there is a cruelty in Love, By which that Deity does magnifie it self: Reason or merit must pretend no share In the free bounties of a heart that Love inclines. Enter Clorinda. Prince Clarimant! Clar. Ha! Clo. Why are you so amazed? Clar. What light breaks from that cloud, And with the sudden brightness dazles my sense! My happiness is such, O speak agen, That by two witnesses my joys may be confirmed. Clo. Why are you thus disturb'd? you oft have seen me. Clar. But never thus, never thus unexpectedly, When I despair'd the happiness. Clo. Had fortune been so envious to deny an opportunity, As I confess this hardly was attain'd, To give you thanks for the last testimony of your love; Yet reason, and the estimation you do hold of me, Might well assure you I could not but resent it Highly. Clar. O heavens! Clo. You are sad; does this acknowledgment offend you? Clar. Offend me, dear Clorinda! 'tis such a joy As justly might transport me from my self: But when I do consider all my merit was but intention And that I can do nothing real in your service, The sense of my misfortune sinks me down low as despair. Clo. The Gods themselves in what we owe to them, Do not require above what they inable us To act: much less is due to me, Who rather am your debtor; which to acquit in part I chiefly came to clear any suspition You might have conceived from my kind usage Of this traitor Prince; yet know if you believed me Guilty, it was a crime I can as hardly pardon As your too much love. Clar. The last is such a guilt as every minute multiplies; And though you cruelly condemn it, such is yet The riches of my soul. Clo. But if you wish, as you profess, my happiness And satisfaction, temper it so, that I may pay the like; The affection of a brother to a sister I will allow you. Clar. In this you do so far exceed my hopes or merit, That it were ingratitude not to acknowledge A bounty infinitely great: But since that Sisterly affection does not debar you From conferring a greater happiness upon some other, A happiness which I must burst with envy to behold: Nay, curse whom you so bless, you do but raise me high, To throw me down with greater violence. Clo. To cure this fear, the Gods be witness, No others interest ever shall exceed Prince Clarimant's. Clar. Nor shall their happiness then, by this fair hand. Clo. But if beyond this you but hope, you injure me And vertue.âSo peace dwell with you. Clar. Alas, already you forget your promise; You wish peace, and remove it from me, Would any sister do so to a brother? Clo. Yes, to preserve herself and him: Were we discover'd, you were lost. The Prince which my unhappy beauty hath surprized Neglects Olinda, and certainly does fix his thoughts On me: With him, as far as honor would permit, I have dissembled, entertain'd his flame With no dislike; by which you are preserv'd as yet, And not ill used: But this stolne visit Would to him express more kindness Then he must think I have for youâ Enter Prince, Cleon, and Sailors. I hear some entring the Cabinâ Heaven! it is the Prince: Who have we here? Death seise him, And throw him overboard. [They seise him] Clo. O heavens! what art can save him? Clar. O for a sword! Clo. Dare you presume to speak of love to me, And do an act so base? The meer intent, Were you not rooted here, would cancel all your interest. Pr. My interest! Clo. But if you value my respect so little, And your own promise for his noble usage, Yet wisdom bids you not forget the advantage That his life may bring more then his death. Cle. She tels you true; remember why we did at first Preserve him to make our peace, should not our plot Take on Agenor. Pr. Take him away and bind him. Clo. Why sure he cannot flie: To leap into the sea, Were to perform himself that which you threaten. Pr. Remove him hence however. Clar. Fortune! that gives this man this power. Pr. I look upon him as a hated Rival, away with him. Exit with Clar. Clo. Come, I forgive this passion, the cause That it proceeds from being love to me, The error too that you are in is punishment enough. Pr. Though I suspect all for dissembled, Yet I am pleas'd to hear her; what was my error? Clo. A gross mistake of this stolne visit, And yet love was my grand errand. Pr. Where's my mistake then? Clo. Patience, and hear me: You thought Olinda Once did love you, and you were not mistaken; She did so till she knew the Prince: You found her alter'd; and of me mistaking The true cause, were jealous. Now by the Gods, If I have truth, she loves the Prince. Pr. And so I fear do you. Clo. By way of gratitude; but for affection, Heaven witness with me I loved another: Yet where I find distrust and disrespect, Such as you have exprest, I am no longer bound. Cle. Infinite cunning! Clo. But to proceed: Finding this Ladies passions Strong to Clarimant, my obligations great, By way of gratitude, I thought my self obliged To make him happy in Olinda's love, And doubt not to effect it, though I must blush to say so. I found some arguments besides that prest me To this undertaking; for were their hearts so fixt On other, your peace with both the Kings were quickly made, And you stood free to make a new election: Yet were all women of my mind, You should stay long enough without a wife, you are so passionate. Pr. Most excellent Clorinda, pardon the rashness of your servant, Who henceforth yields himself for ever to be dispos'd Of by you. Clo. Well, if I find so, I never was ungrateful. Ex Prince &amp; Clor. Cle. How with a twin'd thred does she ride the Ass, And turns him how she please! but when I consider, It is no wonder, she hath a depth of policie Which all my art could never fathom: True, Blinded by my love, I could not reach her aims: But stood I free, she wanting the advantage Of loves power upon me, how poor and shallow Were the arts of all the sex? But as it is, Fortune hath given this silly Prince The power to crush me into nothing; Breaks his contract with me touching Clorinda, Which was the soul of all my undertaking. Is there no way to right my self? yes, This could revenge my wrongs on him, But then I perish in the act, and leave Clorinda To be enjoy'd by Clarimant: that must not be, No, ere my Rival shall so happy prove, I to my hate will sacrifice my love. Exit.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5. ScÃ¦n. 1. Enter Cleon, Clorinda, Prince (following.) Clo. Sir, pardon this disturbance of your thoughts. Cle. Your presence rather, fairest Lady, May rectifie any disorder, Since you are all a harmony of sweetness. Clo. Sir, I perceive your power great with this noble Prince, And I believe so much a friend to him, That he would hearken to your councel: If you would join with reason, and so perswade him To set Prince Clarimant and the Princess at liberty, I think it were an act would shew much friendship To him, and for your self gain what reward You would desire from both the Kings. Cle. I have observed, most beautiful Clorinda, Such an excess of nobleness in you, I scarcely dare express what I would undertake To serve you: but then you really Must let me know all your desires. Clo. It is Cleon. Cle. Lady, dare you adventure to speak your wishes? Clo. I have done so. Cle. That Clarimant and the Princess should be Delivered, I do believe is your desire: But is that all? are you pleas'd to be here? Clo. Why should I not? am I not nobly used? Cle: I know those who are wicked fear not To break an oath; but such whose heart Is fill'd with vertue, as I am sure yours is, Would not be perjur'd for the world. Clo. To what tends this? Cle. That you do swear not to discover What I shall propose touching your service. Clo. You need not doubt, if it do suit With what I have exprest is my desire. Cle. My end shall be the same, their liberty and yours, Though happily our ways to that may differ. Clo. My liberty! Cle. Yes, yours the most desired: Swear, and then hear what I propose. Clo. I do, so far as vertue binds. Cle. That tye all men have on you. Clo. If your intents be fair, why will you ask A stronger obligation then? Cle. I dare not speak my thoughts without an oath. Clo. What can he mean?âI swear never to speak Of that you shall propound; nor need I, Since the Prince does overhear. Cle. Then know, I am not ignorant how you dissemble With this treacherous Prince, whom you And all the world must hate. Clo. This will undo me; I hate the Prince! Cle. Yes, Lady, deadly; yet less then I. Pr. 'Tis well. Cle. All for your sake; and for that noble Prince, If you consent, this hand, if Clarimant's Be not more able to effect it, Shall take revenge, and right our general wrongs. Clo. I do complain of none; If I did, how could this be effected? Cle. With ease; nay more, it is not impossible, The deed done, to escape to shore in the ship-boat, Into which the Prince and you, the night assisting, May get before. Enter Prince. It is impossible; you are deceiv'dâ A Guard there! [Ent. Guard and Sailors] Seise the Villain. Cle. How? what mean you sir? All that I spoke Was but to let you see how she abused you, And this the plot that Clarimant and she had laid: You know, upon your life depends my happiness. Pr. Mine in thy death: This cunning cannot save you, Cleon. Cle. Nor do I wish it should, If you indeed believe me guilty. Pr. Bind him, I will have thee tortur'd limb from limb, Till thou confess all truth. Clo. Let me intreat, sir, for his life, However I am by him accused. Pr. For hating me; which I have too much reason To believe is truth. Clo. How can you think so? Did I not place you to overhear him? Pr. But knew not what he would deliver. See Clarimant fast bound; and (Madam) My cabin this night shall be your chamber. Clo. Perhaps my death-bed: Lost for ever! Exeunt. Enter Selina (bound.) O you just Gods! how all my treasons Against my sweet and innocent Mistress are return'd Upon my head! Prince Clarimant, I am thy murdress, To the fair Olinda, by my means betraid: O horror! what will my torments be for this Hereafter in the other world? All this For love of thee false Cleon have I done, Thy cursed brain gave birth to all my plots: Is this the Crown thou mad'st me fondly hope for? And shall I die without revenge? revenge! My hands fast bound, there's nothing left that I can Reach thee with but curses, fruitless curses. He shall live happy, gain a Kingdom and Clorinda, By her a Kingdom: why should I pitty her then? It is she that is the ground of all my misery, His love to her makes me thus wretched: For Clarimant, he may hereafter marry with Olinda, All but my self may yet be happy: Must I alone die wretched, contemn'd and scorn'd? Why do I longer live, my guilt and miseries so great? You Gods, or Fiends, remove me from this miserable Earth, and let me feel new punishments, If punishments there be hereafter, These they cannot exceed: how sweet were yet Revenge! O for revenge, that Cleon's heart Were in my hand! false Cleon's!âno way. Exit. Enter Clorinda, Olinda. Clo. O dearest Olinda, what are the miseries That we are faln into! Thinking to rid my self Of a false Vilain, I have brought ruine On us all; no art can help us now. Oh the hard choice! to marry with this traitor Prince; or Clarimant must die. Olind. It were better you consent to marry with the Prince, Then that Prince Clarimant should suffer; Let not him die however. Clo. I know your love to Clarimant Makes you perswade me thus: and I would quickly yield, Did not my oath to Clarimant forbid; But would kill my self ere go to bed. Olind. I must confess I love the Prince, Be not offended that I say so; It was your perswasion first: since, I have seen Such noble actions, as raises him so far Above all other men, that they appear Not worthy of a thought: And yet my love And estimation of your vertue's such, I gladly would submit, nay much rejoice To see such merits join'd. Enter Prince, Clarimant (bound) and Guard. Pr. Clarimant, behold your Judge: for know, Clorinda, This minute you must give consent to marry me, And go to bed; or else immediately his head Goes off. Clo. A cruel choice! Olind. Base man! canst thou expect to scape the hand Of justice, after such cruelty? Pr. It is not from you, Madam, that I expect An answer: Speak Clorinda, give your sentence; For by the Gods there is no way but one of these. Clo. O Clarimant! Clar. Heavens, can you suffer What you have made so excellent, to be thus Miserable? Pr. These lamentations boot not: Speak Lady, I can admit of no delay. Clo. What can I say? Pr. No! strike off his head then. Clo. Oh hold! Pr. Speak, are you mine? Clo. Say, Clarimant. Clar. Madam, to me death will be ease, Since I have liv'd to see you injured thus, And have not power for to revenge it. Pr. Are you resolved? Clar. To suffer what thy barbarous nature can inflict. O help! fire, fire! [Within] Pr. What cry is that? Quench, quench the fire. [Within] Enter 1. O sir, we are all undone! the fire hath taken Amongst the Cabins, past all hope of extinguishing. Enter 2. Flie, flie! the ship, the cordage is a fire: For all the water we can bring, it still increases. Pr. What, burn in the sea! slaves, quench the flames. 2. The Sailors, sir, descend into the Boat: Make sure of that, and reach your other ships, The only means of safety. Pr. Hell and confusion! 2. There's none obey command; but each man looks To his own safety. Clar. O heavens! must then Clorinda perish! Pr. Make sure of the Long-boat for me: Some one kill Cleon, Or rather let him perish in the flames. My wounds receiv'd from Clarimant, I will revenge My self. [Offers to kill] Clo. O sir, if you have hope in me! Pr. It is true; he shall not die yet, But the Gods hereafter shall not save him, Though they thus crost my wishes now: Come Lady, I will take care of you. Clo. We must not part. Pr. I mean it not; there may be use of her, Nay for your sake bring Clarimant along. Clar. 'Tis for thine own, false Prince. Pr. But look well to him. Clar. You Gods! Your powerful justice in these flames is shown, Preserve Clorinda, and your mercy's known. Exeunt. Enter Sailor (with a casket.) Gramercy fire! the element of water never yet Afforded me so much: this I can swim to shore With; yet the wind blows high; but to the Shoreward I may escape; if not, why so Whoever finds my body, shall give me thanks. Enter Selina (her hands bound.) Sel. O gentle Sailor, untie my hands! Sail. A pretty boy; come,âIt will not do, My knife: so, canst swim? Sel. Oh no. Sail. Then get some board or pack: I fear I shall be Drown'd, I am so well natur'd on the sudden. No use of thisâ Exit. Enter Cleon (hands bound.) Cle. Just heavens! Sel. True, Cleon; never so manifest. Cle. Gentle Selina, unbind my hands: Sel. I were ingrate else, Cleon: you did as much for me. Cle. And would do more; any thing; unbind me, Sweet, I'll swim with thee upon my back to shore. Sel. You cannot swim, I am sure you shall not. Cle. No creature living better; I oft have swam two leagues For pleasure: O delay not, the fire approaches. Sel. But will you marry me, and make good all your promises? Cle. By the Gods I will. Sel. Sure you will agen deceive me. Cle. Never, by my hopes. Sel. The only time you ever yet spoke truthâ You shall not: yet still thy heart is false. Cle. It is not; quick unbind me, gentle Selina. Sel. Well, for once I'll try what your heart holds. Cle. Blest Selina! O cruel! yet spare me She wounds him. Dear Selina. Sel. Yes, when I see your heart, or blood come from it. Cle. O witch, devil! Sel. I am to thee so: What policie can now defend? Know to thy greater torment, I set the ship On fire, only to be reveng'd on thee, Not hoping such a happiness as this, With these to behold thy false heart blood. Cle. O that my eyes could look thee dead! Sel. I will see them closed, my dearest husband, It is my duty. Cle. First we'll to sea together. Sel. Since we mustâ Exeunt, fall as into the sea. Enter Prince, Clarimant, Clorinda, Olinda, Sailors. 1 Sail. It were best to enter further within the wood: A Boat made after us when we forsook the ship: 2 Sail. Some Fisherman, that to avoid the storm, Put to the shore. Pr. Let the winds blow and split, since we are Here: Fire, air, and water have oppos'd my wishes; Kind mother Earth grant what they have denied. But why should I intreat, that may command All my desires? Once more, Clorinda, I propose the choice; say, shall he die, Or will you make me happy, who loves you More then he? Clar. Traitor thou lyest: He that truly loves Clorinda, Would give some noble testimony: Unbinde my hands, And by my death, as a worthy Rival, Win her from me: I ask no sword, Only the freedom of my hands; but if thy coward heart Think that too much, take all these to assist. Pr. You need not pull death faster on you By injurious words; it is ready, Speak Clorinda, or he dies. Clo. Hold, and give me leave to speak a few sad words. Dear Clarimant, I know to save your life, And yield my self anothers, were such a choice You never could allow, since to the miserable Life is a burden: Could my death Make you happy, the Gods be witness I would lay it down with joy, Our fates I find are one; the merit of your love And sufferings for my sake is such, That I should hold my self ingrate, Did I not grant you any thing That I might think might comfort you in death. Clar. But shall I dare to speak wy wishes? Clo. More then dare; I do enjoin it. Clar. There is a happiness would make my death My triumph. Clo. I understand you. Here! alas that I should give My hand to Clarimant, and he not able To receive it! Our hearts may yet be join'd For ever, and only by these miseries They could have been. Pr. Is this the fruit of my delay, To hear my Rival courted? Clo. Know tyrant, 'tis the same, Offers to kill Clar. Clo. steps between, and Oli. hinders it. One stroke dispatches both. Clar. Strike here then, vilain. Olind. Devil, dost thou believe there are no Gods? Enter Agenor, Clindor. Age: Clindor, this way I saw them enter. Clind. I am out of breath, sir. Pr. Ha, who are these? Clind. See sir, the traitor Prince. Clar. Unbind me, dear Clorinda. (Agenor and Clindor fight with the Prince, then drive off the Sailors and follow them: Clar. kills the Prince. Then) Enter Agenor (wounded) and Clindor. Clar. O dearest brother, how is it with you? Age. Well, Clarimant, never so well. Clo. By all that's good, you never in my eye Lookt half so lovely as now: yet till this day I never could have said I lov'd another better Then your Majesty. Age. If it be Clarimant, my joys are then compleat. Olind. It is he, sir; who could else deserve it? Age. How favourable are the Gods unto the vertuous! How just to wicked men! How glad will my Austela be Of this, who with the King will straight be here? They from the shore beheld your ship, when it Took fire, saw you put off from it, And watcht your landing certainly. Clar. Know you what Bark it was That follow'd us at sea? Age. I was in that, and Clindor, Some twenty with me to watch the ship, Till other Vessels were prepared: So swift she was of sail, that all the Fleet Could not have hurt us.âSee, the King! Enter King, Austela, Attendants. Au. What happiness? all safe? K. Welcom again, my dearest. Age: Let's lose no time; delay were now ingratitude: See, a Temple close by prompts us To the performance of two duties: The burial of this unhappy Prince; But chiefly to render thanks unto the Gods. Deliverance so great, alacrity commands In giving thanks: that done, we'll join your hands. Clo. It were folly now to deny the ceremonial, The real part already past. Clar. O dear Clorinda! 'Twere vain to think words could my joys express, Rais'd from despair to such a happiness. Exeunt. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. First, Ladies, unto you I am addrest, As those who judge of Lovers actions best: If Clarimant your suffrages hath gain'd, Our Author hath his chiefest end obtain'd: Now Sirs to youâ Sure here's no Lover will Clorinda blame For gratitude, since you must hope the same: Perhaps you rather think she was too nice, That such a flame no sooner thaw'd her ice: Our Author hopes she did but her just part; He nobly woo'd, she timely gave her heart: To both the sexes we prefer this sute; Ere you give sentence, with your selves dispute: If then condemn'd, to whom should we appeal, But to that Prince that pardons faults of zeal? If then condemn'd, 'twere pride to make appeal, Yet there remains a pardon in our zeal:</field>
