      <field name="fulltext">TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, Edward, Earle of Dorset, Lord Chamberlaine to the Qveenes Most Excellent Majesty, Knight of the Noble order of the Garter, and one of his Majesties most Honorable Privie Councell.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Reader. Generous Reader, For this Dramatick Poem, I need not much Apologie; It having past so many Tests of Approbation, yet for commendable Customes sake I follow the tradition of all or most Authors, who were never deficient in this kind of complement: The Argument is taken from Apuleius, an excellent Morrall, if truly understood, and may be called a golden Truth, contained in a leaden fable, which though it be not altogether conspicious to the vulgar, yet to those of Learning and judgement, no lesse apprehended in the Paraphrase, than approved in the Originall: of which, if the perusers hereof were all Apuleians, and never a Midas amongst them, I should make no question: So much for the Subject it selfe, but for the rare decorements which new apparell'd it, when it came the second time to the Royall view, (Her Gracious Majesty then entertaining his Highnesse at Denmarke-hous, upon his Birth-day) I cannot pretermit to give a due Charracter to that admirable Artist, Mr. Inego Jones, Master surveyor of the Kings worke, &amp;c. Who to every Act, nay almost to every Sceane, by his excellent Inventions, gave such an extraordinary Luster; upon every occasion changing the stage, to the admiration of all the Spectators: that, as I must Ingeniously confesse, It was above my apprehension to conceive, so to their sacred Majesties, and the rest of the Auditory; It gave so generall a content, that I presume they never parted from any object, presented in that kind, better pleased, or more plenally satisfied: But these I leave to your judgements to ghesse at; the thing it selfe I propose to your eyes, to consure, which if you judge as favourably as I expresse it freely, I shall ever remaine as heretofore: Studious of your best opinions. Tho: Heyvvood</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue to this Play, the first time it was Presented on the Stage; Cupid descending in a Cloud, the Speaker. It was a Custome 'mongst the Romanes, when State-Ladies they invited, or great men, As if their doores were all too base, and vile To entertaine them; their large Roofes to untile, And their unbounded welcome more to crowne, In Artificiall Cloudes to let them downe; Their superstitious Love so farre extending, Receiving them as gods from heaven descending. Although we cannot meet you with like state, As entring hither at our publike gate, You are as welcome; 'Tis Love bids you so: And, as their use was, to their guests to show Their best, and costliest Jewels (without boast, So Cupid will) what he affecteth most, His sweet and dearest Mistris; or if ought Were more in valuation, or in thought, That you should see: She is both fresh and new, Then bid her but as welcome, as I, you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Her Majesty inviting the King to Denmark House, in the Strand, upon His Birth-day, being November the 19. This Play (bearing from that time) the Title of the Queens Masque, was againe presented before Him: Cupid speaking the Prologue. Who's so un-read, doth not of Plato heare, His Annus Magnus, or his Vertent yeare; In which the Starres, and Planets, Moone, and Sun, Tyr'd with continuall labour, having runne So many Ages long peregrination, And returnes fresh and new to It's first station. This is that yeare sure; rather this the day, Able to change November into May: This day's in heaven a Jubylee of Joy, Where Angels sing in quires, Vive la Roy. This is the Royall Birth-day of a King, Then men with Angels IopÃ¦an sing. I'had almost lost my selfe, when my intent Was to tell why I come, and from whom sent: From One, to whom I'me but a shadow, Shee The very soule of Amabilitee. One, that without my quiver and my bow, Commands the hearts and eyes, of high and low. Whose Name (Inscribed here) did you but behold, 'Twould change the sooty Inke, to liquid Gold Of fulgent beauty; but so pure a mind, As if tinctur'd from Heaven, and so devin'd. I Love, from Love am sent, but She the right: Then grace (Great King) the Triumphs, of Loves night.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Epilogue, spoken by Cupid, pointing to the severall Plannets. Now Royall Princes, let me turne to you, Daigne from Loves mouth, to take this nights adieu: Thinke all these Plannets that on earth here move, (Shadowes of those CÅlestiall ones above) Breath on you their best Influences; Vulcan he, Shall henceforth take charge of your Armory. Juno the Marriage Queen, shall blesse your bed: The Sunne shall take the bright beames from his head, To increase your glories lusture: and the Moone, Attend on you, to make your Mid-night noone: And Mercury shall roame from shore to shore Upon your errands, proove your happy ranger, Home-bred to 'spie and foresee forraigne danger: Venus with sweets, and I with Love will charme you; And after all these, Ioue with Power shall arme you. I'have kept you waking long, good night, 'tis late, And many Birth-dayes may you Celebrate.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue to the King and Queene, the Second time it was Acted, the same Week: Spoken by Cupid. Yes; sure 'twas here: where some few houres I past, The very time that I descended last; I, here it was, I know it by one face, To which my Mistris Psiche must give place. A presence; that from Venus takes all power, And makes each place she comes in, Cupids bower. Though in their severall spheares, each Planet ride, (With all the gods) to feast me and my bride, With Nectar and Ambrosia, yet, that waste Of godly fare could not my pallat taste: But I must all CÃ¦lestiall sweets forbeare, To re-view earthly Iove, and Iuno here, Whom having seen; Haile to you once againe; Long as the spheares continue, may you Raigne In Majesty, in power, in issue blest, Be all these with your fortunate yeeres Increast; Till Cupid (ever yong) with Time grow old, And you, this Iron Age, changing to gold. (Re-pur'd by your two vertues) These etheriall, May change to brighter Chaires in th'Heavens Imperiall.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. I. SCÃ. I. Enter Apuleius, with a paire of asse eares in his hand. How art thou Apuleius retransform'd? Or else how cam'st thou metamorphis'd first Into an Asse? Why to so dull a beast, Of slow, and so obtuse a memory? I had a braine aym'd at inscrutable things, Beyond the Moon; what was sublunary, Me thought was for my study all too meane; Therefore, I therefore was I thus transhap'd: That knowing man who keeps not in his bounds, But pryes into heavens hidden Mysteries Further than leave, his dulnesse is increast, Ceaseth to be a man, and so turnes beast: And thus I fell, yet by the selfe same power, That calls all humane wisedome foolishnesse, Am once more to my pristine shape restor'd; Only to show how vaine my ambitions were, This follies crest I still about me beare: I faine would know the way to Helicon, Can none here tell me? Will none silence breake? It seems these sit to heare then, not to speak. Enter Midas. Here's one I hope can tell me: Reverend Father, How lies my journey to the Muses hill? Mi. Follow thy nose. Ap. Thou most unreverend groome, (I hope my Asses shape is quite shook off) Why in this churlish manner speak'st thou then? Mi. The Muses? hang the Muses. Ap. Can'st thou conduct My wandring steps to Aganippes spring? To the Muses Temple I am travelling And must to them performe a sacrifice. Mi. An Asse head of thy own, thou must performe. Ap. If men be growne thus savage; oh you powers, Remetamorphise mee into an asse; 'Tis lesse inglorious, and lesse griefe to live A beast amongst wilde beasts, then to see man Bruite-like to blemish his creation. Mi. I tell thee once againe, I know no Muses; No Muses hill, no Aganippes spring; And which is more, I care for no such toyes. Ap. And which is worst, none wise will care for thee; Oh griefe, that silver haires should crowne his head; By whom the Muses are dishonoured: Say Idoll, what's thy name? Mi. What's that to thee? Yet was I sometime King of Phrigia, To whom god Bacchus was beholding once: And therefore bad me aske what I would have, I should be granted; Instantly I begg'd That whatsoere I touch'd might turne to Gold; At first it pleas'd mee: When I sate to eate, I touch'd the Table, and it straight was gold, The trenchers gold; I call'd for earthen vessells, Which by my touch were alcumis'd to gold, All which I hugg'd; but when I came to carve, Even as the dishes, so the meat was gold; The liquid wine, but touch'd, was straight congeal'd; And had not Bacchus freed me from my wish, Amid'st my gold I had beene starv'd ere this. Ap. Dull covetous foole. Mi. The shame of this made mee resigne my state; And where before I was a King of men, To flie the harshnes of fooles bitter jeasts, I made this wooll crowne, and am King of beasts, And my name's Midas. Ap. Then oh King of beasts, Be this thy curse; when thy base life's out-worne, No sacred Poet name thee but in scorne: But wilt thou sit with silence? Mi. Thou prat'st and bablest, what would'st thou have me doe? Ap. Seest thou this spheare spangled with all these starres, All these Love-arts; nor shall they part from hence With unfeasted cares: my purpose was To expose them to the shapes of all those asses, With whom my lost soul wandred in a mist, Knowing, of them thou art not counted least; But first I'll shew a story of mine owne, Of Cupids love to Psiche, sit and see't; I'll make thee then ingeniously confesse Thy treason 'gainst the Muses Majesty; Withall, not only whatsoever's mine, But all true Poets raptures are divine. Mi. Thou hast prevail'd with me, by Pan I'll stay; But take heed Poet that your rimes be sound, Else with thine owne asse eares thou shalt be crown'd. Ap. We two contend; Art here, there Ignorance: Be you the Judges, we invite you all Vnto this banquet Accademicall. Exeunt. Recorders. Enter Admetus, Menetius, Zelotis, Astioche, Petrea, Psiche. Ad. You Peers and Daughters to th'Arcadian King, We have past the great'st part of our Pilgrimage; Listen, oh listen, for these sounds that guild The ayres light wings, fanning through all our eares Immortall tunes; tell us we are ariv'd At sacred Delphos; see the burnish'd Spires Advance themselves to welcome our approach; The Temple gates stand ope, and that great Deitie, Whose tongue speaks nothing lesse than Oracle, Attended by his Sibells, daines to appeare. Enter Apollo. Mene. Oh teach our knees with a most reverent touch, To kisse this hallowed earth. Zelo. Ladies kneel downe. Astio. And sir relate to faire Latonaes Son, Why this religious voyage was attempted. Ad. Daughters I shall: Sacred Apollo, god of Archery, Of Arts, of Physicke, and of Poetry: Ioves bright hair'd Son, whose yellow tresses shine Like curled flames, hurling a most divine, And dazling splendor on these lesser fires, Which from thy guilt beams, when thy Carre retires, Kindle those tapers that lend eyes to night: Oh thou that art the Landlord of all light; Bridegroom to morning, dayes eternall King, To whom Nine Muses in a sacred ring, In dances sphericall, trip hand in hand, Whilst thy well-stringed Harpe their feet command, Great Delphian Priest, we to adore thy name Have burnt fat thighs of Bulls in hallowed flame, Whose savor wrapt in clouds of smoak and fire, To thy Star-spangled pallace durst aspire; Tell us who shall untie the Virgin Zone Of the white-handed Psiche; she alone Of three most faire, is most unfortunate; All love, but none her love will celebrate With nuptiall rights; what must of her betide, Dread Phebus tell, to whom shall she be bride. Apol. Cloath Psiche in a mourning weed, Then lead and leave her on a hill, Where Venus Doves their yong ones feed, Her husband not of humane race; But one, whose flaming sight doth kill, And yet wants eyes; his serpents face If she behold, she must see hell, And yet by some notorious deed, Obtaine a Patent from that place Never to die: Psiche farewell, Much joy'd, much griev'd; unclaspe that spell. Ex, Apollo. Ad. Much griev'd, and yet much joy'd, poore girle. I fear The scale of griefe will weigh downe that of cheer. Mene. She must see hell, and yet she nere shall die; True, for hels torments live eternally. Asti. But father, no tongue shall her joyes expresse. Petre. Phebus, thy words leave us all comfortlesse. Psi. I must espouse a serpent, that's my hell. Zelo. But since you never shall behold his face, Your torments cannot be too horrible. Mene. Is't possible, by deeds impossible To attaine the Crowne of immortality: It cannot be: Thus mocking Phebus leaves us, Alwayes in clouds of darkenesse to deceive us, Ad. Stay thy prophane tongue, lest deserved wrath, Strike thee with death from his revengefull spheare: Thou must be cloath'd in mourning, so thou art, A mourning habite, and a thought-sicke heart: Thou must be left alone on Venus hill: The destinies decree, we must fulfill: Thy husband must want sight, and yet have eyes That flame, and kill; oh leave these mysteries Vntill the gods reveale them; come, let's hence: Change your Arcadian tunes to Lidian sounds, Sad notes are sweetest, where deep woe confounds. Exeunt omnes. Recorders. Enter Venus. Ven. Cupid my Son, where's he? Within. Cup. Anon: forsooth. Ven. I'le gather rods of Roses, if you mock me With your anon-forsooth. Within. Cup. Anon-forsooth. Ven. Shall I be thus still vext? still when my blood Boyles in the fire of anger, then this ape With purpose frets me.âBoy. Enter Cupid. Cup. Anon-forsooth. Ven. Will Juno come, or Ceres? Cup. Iuno lay lolling in my Vncles lap. Ven. Which Vncle? Cup. Vncle Iove: I laught out-right To see how (wanton-like) with both her armes, She clung about his necke; gave him ten kisses, Toy'd with his lockes, look'd babies in his eyes, And swore she would not watch him when he went Amongst his wenches, if he'd turne away His sawcy page, the smooth-fac'd Ganimed; The boy by chance upon her fan had spilt A cup of Nectar; oh how Iuno swore: I told my Aunt I'de give her a new fan, To let Ioves page be Cupids serving-man. Ven. What's this to Venus message, what said Iuno? Cup. I ask'd her when she'd come, and in good sooth, She answered nothing but anon-forsooth. Ven. And where was Ceres, what did she reply? Cup. Ceres was binding garlands for god Pan, Of Blew-bottles, and yellow Pissabeds That grew amongst the Wheat, with which she crown'd His forked browes, and woed him with his horne To rouze the skipping Satyrs, to go hunt A herd of swine that rooted up her corne: I ask'd her when she'd come, and in good sooth, She sent me packing with anon-forsooth. Ven. I sent for Pan, and for Apollo too What news from them? Cup. They said they would be here immediatly. Enter Pan and Apollo. Apo. Why in such haste hath Venus sent for us? Ven. I sent for Iuno, and for Ceres too, But they'll not come. Pan. Well, what's the news with you: Ven. Have you not heard how Venus is contemn'd? Her Temples gaz'd at, but not troad upon, Her stately hangings, and her pillowes torne; Those rosie garlands that her statues crown'd, Are wither'd, or else trampled on the ground; Those troops that flock'd to Paphos to adore me, Shun Paphos now, and scornefully abhor me. Pan. That's strange, for all are up to th'eares in love; Boyes without beards get boyes, and girles beare girles, Fine little rattle-babies, scarce thus high, Are now call'd wives; If long this hot world stand, We shall have all the earth turne Pigmy-land. Ven. All honour Love, but none adore Loves Queen: Apol. The injury is great, but from whence springs it? Ven. From Psiche daughter to the Arcadian King; They call her Queen of Love, will know no other, And swear my Son shall kneel and call her mother. Cup. But Cupid swears to make the jacks forsworne. Apol. Will Citharea swallow this disgrace? Pan. What shall Pan doe in this? Ven. Lend me your ayds. If you meet Psiche, charge yong Mercury To send me to her, or Imprison her Till you have sent me word. Apol. If this be all, Venus shall have her wish. Pan. Pan by his upright hornes and beard doth swear To hunt out Psiche; but if I doe this, What will sweet Venus give me? Ven. A sweet kisse; And Phebus shall have one, Cupid another, Vpon condition they will right those wrongs Which Psiche in her great pride throws on me: Draw from thy quiver a dull leaden shaft, And sticke it through her bosome to the heart; Make her in love, but let her proud eyes doat On some ill-shapen drudge, some ugly fool, Do this, Ile weave for thee a Coronet Of Roses, mixt with Berenices haire; And give thee my best Chariot, and my Doves, To hunt with on the earth, or in the ayre; Wilt thou do this my boy? Cup. I will for-sooth. Ven. Nay do not mock me, wilt thou? Cup. Yes indeed, indeed I will for-sooth, Ven. Sweet lad adieu then: Apollo, Pan, revenge poor Venus wrongs, Whilst I unyoke my silver coloured team, To wanton on the bosome of yon stream. Exit. Apol. Now she hath call'd me downe unto the earth, I'le try what pastimes dwell amongst the swaines. Exit. Pan. And with my Satires I will have some sport Here in the Arcadian valleys. Exit. Cup. Shall Psiches beautious eyes gaze on base love? No, let my Mother storme, and chafe and lower, She shall be none but Cupids Paramour: Enter Zephirus. Ho Zephirus,âhow now thou puffing slave, Art thou growne proud, thou swell'st so? Gentle winde, Clap on thy smoothest feathers, sleekest wings, And mount thee to the top of yonder rocke, There shalt thou finde anon a forlorne maid, Convey her gently downe unto the vaile That borders on my bower; see this perform'd, And I will cloathe thee in a grasse-green Robe, Spotted with Dasies Pincks, and Marigolds; I'le play the thief in Flora's treasury, To make all eyes in love with Zephirus; Fly hence, do this, and henceforth be thou King Of all the Windes, and father of the Spring. Exeunt. Enter Admetus, Menetius, Zelotis, Astioche, Petrea, Psiche. Ad. Behold the foot of that unhappy Rocke, Vpon whose frozen top, by Phebus doome, Thou must abide thy most sinister hap. Astio. Deare sister Psiche. Psi. Peace Astioche. Petrea, Father: you should all have mourn'd When the mad spirits of the multitude Kneel'd downe and, call'd me Venus; then have wept, When Cithareas Altars were left bare, And I was call'd a goddesse; when these teares, whose reeking makes my funerall lights burne dimme, Might have quench'd Venus wrath; but leave me now To fight with death, or meet worse misery. Mene. But lurkes that serpent in this fatall rocke? Pet. So said Apollo. Zelo. Then Menetius, We will conduct faire Psiche to the cave, And rip the monsters intrails with our swords. Psi. Forbeare all force, I will ascend alone; Phebus will be displeas'd; Alone said he, Distressed Psiche shall climbe up yon hill. Ad. The way is dangerous, thou wilt loose thy selfe Without a guide. Psi. Death must my conduct me, See where the pale hagge stands; vaine world adieu, I am his bride, he waits for none of you. She climbes up the Rocke. Ad. What pains the poore girle takes, see how she strives Against the swelling bosome of the hill. Mene. See the kinde brambles, as enamor'd of her, Circle her beauty in her catching armes, Woeing her to come backe; as who should say, Thou run'st too fast to death, sweet Psiche stay. Ad. But all in vaine, she now hath climb'd the Rocke. And wafts her hand, doe you the like to her, Whose timelesse death prepares my Sepulchre. Petre. Sister with courage meet thy destiny, To morrow, if thou liv'st, we'll visite thee. Exeunt. Enter Cupid and Zephirus. Cup. Fly Zephirus, on top of yonder mount My faire Love sits; on thy soft swelling wings Let Psiche rideâyou voyces that attend me, Ex. Zep. Dance in the ayre like wantons, to intice My love to dwell in Cupids Paradise: Musicke with ravishing tones inchant her eares; A banquet there: She that doth Cupid wed, Thus shall she live, and thus be honoured. Exit. Enter Zephirus, and takes Psiche from the Rock, and Exit with her in his armes. A Banquet brought in. Enter Zephirus with Psiche and places her at the Banquet, and Exit. Psi. Where am I now? For through the cheerfull ayre Hither I have been brought, on unseen wings; What wonderous place is this? No serpent sure Lurkes in this pleasant bowre: my eare drinks founds Of heaven-tun'd Instruments; I see no creature, And yet me thought soft fingers set me downe, And I am forc'd by sweet compulsion, A Banquet first plain, and presently set out with all Delicates. To be the only guest of this faire board, Which empty, is as soon new furnished; I faine would touch these sweets, but feare to taste them. Ecoho. Taste them. 2. Taste them. 3. Taste them. Psi. What voice is that? I dare no longer sit. Ecoho. Sit. 2. Sit. 3. Sit. Psi. Who mockes me? Are you devils, or are you gods? Ecc. Gods. 2. Gods. 3. Gods. Psi. The gods will do no harme. Ecc. No harme. 2. No harme. 3. No harme, Psi. Psiche be bold, and taste this heavenly food. Ecc. Ha ha ha. 2. Ha ha ha. 3. Ha ha ha. Psi. These are no Ecchoes, for they shift their place, Nor catch they my last words, as Ecchoes doe: For when I would have fed, they mock'd my pride, They laught aloud at my presumption: No, these ate Fury-Elves, and will torment me. Enter Zephirus with drinke. If thus I talke to them,âWho fils this wine, And tempts my eye with it? as who should say, Drinke Psiche. Ecc. Drinke Psiche. 2. Drinke Psiche. 3. Drinke Psiche. Psi. I'le taste no drop of this inchanted wine: Faine from this Magick circle would I rise, Yet dare not; oh let Psiche see your eyes, Or rid me hence, and set my feares in peace. Ecc. Peace. 2. Peace. 3. Peace. Enter Cupid. Cup. How lovely is my Psiche; earth's too base To be possest of her Celestiall forme: My mother hates her; for the gods I feare Would banish her from earth, my Love being there; And therefore shall she live in Cupids Bower, For she deserves to be loves Paramour: Oh how my faire eyes wound me; by this kisse, And this white hand. Psi. Oh me! what voice is this I feel? besides, soft fingers, and a Ring. Cup. Long white fingers, soft white hand, Ring and all at thy command. Psi. Is this my husband then? Cup. Ho Zephirus, Remove hence those Ambrosian dishes straight. Zephirus takes off the Banquet. Psi. My father much mistook the Oracle; To this sweet voice, could I enjoy the sight, I should my selfe then stile Queen of delight. Cup. Pleasure shall be thy lacky; wilt thou hunt, Then in an ayery Charriot, drawne by birds, On the windes downie back my love shall ride; Mild Zephirus shall be thy Waggoner; Who if the heat offend, his silver wings Shall fan coole ayre upon thee, yet my love, If thou commit'st one sin, thou art not mine. Psi. Name it, and I'le avoid it for your sake. Cu. Thy mourning sisters shortly will returne, And seek thee on the rocke from whence thou cam'st, But shun their sight and speech; Psiche do this, Thou rob'st me else of love, thy selfe of blisse. Psi. Not speak nor see my sisters; oh what pleasure Can Psiche take, lock't in a golden Jayle? Cup. Run not unto thy ruine gentle love; Yet if thou needs wilt see and speak with them, Command thy servant Zephirus to bring them From top of yonder Rocke into this vaile; But if they make inquiry who I am, Fill both their laps with gold, and send them gon, Besides I woe thee by this nuptiall kisse, Do not perswade me to disclose my shape, Attempting that, thou loosest this high state; I then must leave thee, thou live desolate. Psi. In all these things, I will obey my love. Cup. Then Psiche, in thine unseen husbands hand, Claspe thy white singers; I'le now crowne thy bed With the sweet spoiles of thy lost Maiden-head. Exeunt. Enter Apuleius and Midas. Mi. Hand off, let go my sheep-hook, I'le not stay, I'le hang my selfe, e're I'le see out thy Play: Call you this Poetry? Ap. If this displease thee Midas, then I'le shew thee E're I proceed with Cupid and his love, What kinde of people I commerst withall In my transhape. Mi. That's when thou wert an Asse. Ap. The very same. Mi. Yes, that I faine would see. Ap. Sit then and view thine owne infirmity. A dance. Enter a proud asse with cares. Mi. What fellow's that? Ap. A selfe-will'd insolent foole, Who spights at those above him, and those beneath Despiseth, and his equals jets upon; Rich in his owne conceit, in judgement poor, Still carping, tho' a coxcombe, and may passe, As these dayes go, for a proud arogant Asse. Dance. Enter a Prodigall Asse. Mid. I, this I like; What fellowes that? Ad. A fellow he, Who riots that, which most penuriously His father hoorded, in drabs, drinke and play, Wearing fantastick habits, and gay clothes, Till he hath quite exhausted all his gold, And for a prodigall Asse may be inroul'd. Dance. Enter a Drunken Asse. Mi. This gives me good contentâWhat's he? Ap. A pot-companion, brother to the glasse, That roars in's cups, indeed a drunken Asse. Dance. Enter an Usurer. Mi. He looks like a good fellowâNow that gray-beard? Ap. One that doth pinch his belly in his life, And starve his own guts to make others feed; Patcheth his own clothes to make others proud, And for a covetous Asse may be allow'd. Dance. A young Gentlewoman. Mi. But so did never MidasâNow, that Minks. Ap. Her mothers darling she, borne to good means; In love with all she sees, yet truly, none; Who then great Heires are proffered, trifles them; And in the end, when with none else she can, She marries with her fathers serving-man: And that is a right she-Asse. Dance. An ignorant Asse. Mi. What Reverend person's that of all the other? I like him best. Ap. That Midas, is thy brother, A piece of mooving earth, illiterate, dull; Who having in himselfe naught commendable, Envies What's good in others; and yet dare In his owne impudence, with Arts compare: A blocke, a stone, yet learning he'll revile, And a dull ignorant Asse we will him stile. Mi. But where's your Poet Asse among all these? Dance and Exit. Ap. There's no such creature. Mi. Then what call'st thou those That let not men lie quiet in their graves, But haunt their ghosts with ballats and bal'd rimes? Do they not teach the very feinds in hell Speek in blanke verse; do we not daily see Every dull-witted Asse spit Poetry: And for thy Scene, thou bring'st here on the Stage A young green-sicknesse baggage to run after A little ape-fac'd boy thou tearm'st a god; Is not this most absurd? Ap. Mis-understanding fool, thus much conceive, Psiche is Anima, Psiche is the Soule, The Soule a Virgin, longs to be a bride, The soul's Immortall, whom then can she wooe But Heaven? whom wed, but Immortality: Oh blame not Psiche then, if mad with rage, She long for this so divine marriage. Mid. But tell me then, why should Apollo say, All love her, and yet none will marry her. Ap. All love faire Psiche, all cast amorous eyes On the soules beauty, but who is't will wed her? None with the soul will lead so strict a life, As heaven enjoynes with such a blessed wife. Mi. Thou promp'st my understanding pretty well; But why should Venus being Queen of Love, Wish her Son Cupid to enamour her On some base groom mis-shapen, and deform'd? Ap. By Venus here, is meant untemperate lust; Lust woes here Son Desire, to inflame the soul With some base groom, that's to some ugly sinne; Desire is good and ill; the evill sweares To obey his mother Venus, and vexe Psiche: But Cupid representing true desire, Doats on the souls sweet beauty, sends his servant Zephirus; In whom, Celestiall pleasure's meant, To entice his Love, the Soule, to his chaste bed, Giving her heaven for her lost maiden-head. Mi. Only one Riddle more, and I have done; Why did the poor girle Psiche take such paines? What scrambling shift she made to climbe the mountaine, And crawle through brakes and briers to get a husband. Ap. This shewes how many strong adversities, Crosses, pricks, thornes, and stings of conscience, Would throw the ambitious soule affecting heaven, Into despaire and fainting diffidence, Which Psiche must passe through; the soule must fly Through thousand letts, to seek eternity. Mi. Thou hast made this somewhat plaine. Ap. Kinde Gentlemen, Winke at our strife, you may in pardoning this, Count this our talke a meer Parentesis. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT. II. SCENE I. Enter Psiche, Astioche, and Petrea. Psi. Welcome dear sisters; with the breath of Love, Poor Psiche gives kind welcome to you both: Oh tell me then by what auspicious guide, You came conducted to this sacred place? Asti. Sister you shall: when many a weary step Had brought us to the top of yonder Rocke, Mild Zephirus embrac'd us in his armes, And in a cloud of rich and strong perfumes, Brought's unto the skirts of this green mead, Psi. And happily ariv'd: Nature and Art Have strove to make this dale their treasury; Windes fly on Psiches errands; shapes unseen Are my attendants, and to make me sport, Will dance like nimble Ecchoes in the ayre, And mocke me. Eccho, Mock me. 2. Mock me. 3. Mock me. Psi. Sisters, how like you this? Ec. This, ha ha ha. 2. This, ha ha ha. 3. This, ha ha ha. Petre. They mock us, will they do no harme to us? Psi. Oh no. Eccho. No. 2. No. 3. No. Psi. Bablers, be silent. Eccho. Silent. 2. Silent. 3. Silent. Psi. Or else I'le punish you; And let me heare some MusickeâLoudâAnd still. Loud Musicke, and still Musicke. Tell me, how like you this? Asti. It flies the reach of Admiration. Petr. But let us see the shapes of them that play, What are they, speake? or what's your husbands name? Let's know our brother, that we may relate To th'King our father your high honour'd state. Psi. My husband, sister, is now rid from home. Asti. Why, say he be, I hope you know his name; We'll ransacke all the Pallace but we'll finde him: Is your sweet-heart so proud, he'll not be seen? Petr. Where is he Psiche? Psi. Trust me, he's from home. Asti. Let's see his Picture then? Psi. Lasse I have none. Petr. Describe his person. Psi. I must shift them hence, My tongue will else breed my confusion. Asti. Nay sister, when? Petr. When sister will it be? Psi. How should I give him shape I never saw? He's a faire lovely youth, upon each cheek, Smiles lie in cheerfull dimples; on his brow Sits Love and Majesty in glorious pride; His eyes such beauty in their circles hold, That walking in the night, I have thought them Stars; Long flaxen curled tresses crowne his head. Come, come, you shall not be enamored On my faire husband; this for all suffice, He's yong and rich. Asti. Oh how my blood doth rise, In envy of her high felicity; speake, what's his name? Psi. Home, home; more musicke there, I must to rest: Recorders. Enter Zephirus with bags. Ho Zephirus, come forth, and bring me brim-full baggs of gold: Hold up your laps, tho' them you cannot see That bring this gold, this larges take from me; Adieu, adieu: my duty to the King, I needs must stop mine eares when Syrens sing. Petr. Astioche. Asti. Petrea, oh, I am mad to note her pride; Her husband is no serpent as 'twas said, And false Apollo sung; he is some god, And this his Temple, for no mortall hand Hath laid these Christiall pavements, cloath'd these meades In never-fading liveries of green; Flora you see cloathes all the ground with flowers, Flora is Psiches hand-maid; Zephirus Is but her foot-boy, lackeys at her beck. Petr. Yet she's our sister, and it doth me good To see rich worth in any of our blood. Asti. Thou art a fool Petrea, for I hate That any's fortune should transcend my state; She sends us hence in scorne, but we'll returne, And never cease, till by some treachery, Her pride we make a slave to misery. Exeunt. Enter Admetus, Menetius, and Zelotis. Mene. Patience great sir, you have not lost them all, Doubtlesse the two last live. Zelo. Sir though they be your daughters, th'are our wives, And we are in no such despaire of them. Ad. Admit you were one for Astioche, And that another for Petrea wept, You two, but for two wives shed husbands teares; For you and them, I sorrow all: your feares Divided betwixt you; on me alone, Lies like a mountaine, and thus casteth down Admetus wretched body, with his crowne; They followed Psiche and her destiny, Hath given them death, us living misery. Enter Evemore. Eve. Rise Royall sir, your Daughters are return'd. Ad. Oh where, which way; are my two daughters come? Eve. Yes sir, and both their laps are fill'd with gold. Enter Astioche and Petrea. Ad. Wellcome to both in one; oh can you tell What fate your sister hath? Both. Psiche is well. Ad. So among mortalls it is often sed, Children and friends are well, when they are dead: Astio. But Psiche lives, and on her breath attends Delights that farre surmount all earthly joy; Musicke, sweet voyces, and Ambrosian fare, Windes, and the light-wing'd creatures of the ayre; Cleere channell'd Rivers, springs, and flowry meads, Are proud when Psiche wantons on their streams, When Psiche on their rich Imbroidery treads, When Psiche guilds their Christall with her beams; We have but seen our sister, and behold She sends us with our laps full brimm'd with gold. Adm. Oh, you amaze me Daughters. Pet. Let joy banish amazement from your kingly thoughts, Psiche is wedded to some Deity, And prayes withall, our quicke returne againe, Ad. We grant it; we with you and these, will go To Psiches bowre; desire inflames my minde, To sit on the bright wings of that blest winde. Asti. Oh but the god that governes Psiches thoughts; For sure he is Immortall, charg'd my sister To talke with none but us. Petr. Yet by the magicke of our tongues we'l try If we can win you so much liberty. Ad. Go my Astioche, but come againe To comfort him that must thy want complaine; Go with my love Petrea, but returne With winged speed, whilst we your absence mourne; Go with my blessing; blest those sisters be, That live like you in bonds of unity: Give Psiche this; give her this thou Petrea, Kisseth them. Tell her she is my selfe, my souls Idea. And say, whilst she is spotlesse, lovely white, She shall be my sole comfort, my delight: So part with my best wishes. Exeunt. Enter Clowne, with three or foure Swaines. Clo. And what might you call that yong gentleman, that rules and raignes, revells and roares in these walkes of Arcadia, that makes you borrow sheepes eyes from your flockes, and leaves you no more braines in your heads than in your sheep-hooks? What might you call that gallant? 1 Swa. Whom do you meane, him whom god Pan so honours, the Fawnes feare, and the Satyres shake to see? Clo. Ille ipse, the same; I desire no more than this sheep-hook in my hand to encounter with that swash-buckler. 2 Swa. It is the god of Love, they call him Cupid. Clow. Cupid Coxcombe; your Satyrs are all sots, your Fawnes fooles, and your Pan a pitifull poore fellow; had I their horns (as I know not what I may have in time) I would so gore him; and what weapons doth he use? 3 Swa. They say Bow and Arrowes. Clo. Bow and Bird-bolts doth he not; and how lies hee? where's his guard? what's his play? Can any of you all give me his true title? 1 Swa. Not I, 'tis far beyond me. Clo. Then hearken oh you hoyds, and listen oh you Illiterates, whil'st I give you his stile in Folio: He is King of cares, cogitations, and coxcombes; Vice-roy of vows and vanities, Prince of passions, prate-apaces, and pickled lovers; Duke of disasters, dissemblers, and drown'd eyes; Marquesse of melancholly, and mad folkes, grand Signior of griefs, and groans; Lord of lamentations, Heroe of hie-hoes, Admirall of aymees, and Monsieur of mutton-lac'd. 2 Swaine. Heere's a stile I shall never bee able to get over. Clo. And who do you thinke maintaines this princox in his Pontificalibus? 3 Swa. Nay, it exceeds my capacity. Clo. A company of pitifull fellows call'd Poets; did you never heare of one Homer, and of the Tale of Troy, and of a ten yeers siege, and many such trifles. 2 Swa. Yes, and many things concerning them. Clow. But heare me, oh you misse of mis-understanding; This Troy was a Village of some Twenty houses; and Priam, as silly a fellow as I am, only loving to play the good fellow, hee had a great many bowsing lads, whom he called sonnes. 3 Swa. As we have here in Arcadia. Clo. Just the same; by this Troy ranne a small Brook, that one might stride over; on the other side dwelt Menelaus, a Farmer, who had a light wench to his wife call'd Hellen, that kept his sheep, whom Paris, one of Priams mad lads, seeing and liking, tieeth over the brooke, and lies with her in despight of her husbands teeth: for which wrong, he sends for one Agamemnon his brother, that was then high Constable of the hundred, and complaines to him: hee sends to one Ulisses, a faire spoken fellow, and Towne-clarke, and to divers others, amongst whom was one stout fellow called Ajax, a Butcher, who upon a Holy-day brings a payre of cudgells, and layes them downe in the midst, where the Two Hundreds were then met, which Hector a Baker, another bold lad of the other side seeing, steps forth, and takes them up; these two had a bowt or two for a broken pate; And here was all the circumstance of the Trojan Warres. 1 Swa. To see what these Poets can do. Clowne. But listen to them and they will fill your heads with a thousand fooleries; observe one thing, there's none of you all sooner in love, but he is troubled with their itch, for hee will bee in his Amorets, and his Canzonets, his Pastoralls, and his Madrigalls, to his Phillis, and his Amorillis. 1 Swa. Oh beautious Amorillis. Clo. And what's Amorillis think'st thou? 1 Swa. I faire and lovely creature. Clo. I'le shew thee the contrary by her owne name, Amor is love, illis is ill, is ill, cannot be good; Ergo Amorillis is starke naught; let one or two examples serve for more, there's one of our fairest Nimphes called Susanna; what is Susanna, but Sus and anna, which is in plaine Arcadia, Nan is a Sow. 2 Swa. Well, you have taught us more than ever I understood before, concerning Poetry. Clowne. Come to me but one houre in a morning, and I'le reade deeper Philosophy to you; good-morrow Neighbors; Poets, quoth a; What's Titule tu patule but Titles and Pages; What's Propria que maribus, but a proper man loves Mary-bons, Feminuo generi-tribiunter, but the Feminine Gender is troublesome; what's Ovid, but quasi, avoid; now should I be in love, with whom? with Doll, what's that but Dole and lamentation, with Jugg, what's she, but sister to a black-pot, or what's Pegg, good for nothing but to drive into poste: no Cupid, I defie thee and all thy genealogy. Enter Cupid. Cup. What's he that so prophanes our Deity? And scornes that power which all the gods adore; To whom Iove some-times bends, and Neptune kneels, Mars homageth, and Phebus will submit, Slie Mercury obey, and Vulcan bow too; And all the rurall gods and goddesses, Saytirs and Nimphss allow their soveraigne: He shall not scape unpunished. Clo. If I could but finde one of these fantasticall Poets or light upon that little god their Patron, I would so tickle them. Cup. This hobinall, this rusticke, this base clowne; I finde him of a dull and brain-lesse eye, Such as I know a golden-headed shaft Will never enter; of a skin so thicke, As pointed silver hath no power to pierce: For such grosse fools, I have a bolt in store, Which though it cannot wound, shall give a blow, To startle all within him. Shoots. Clo. Oh me, hey-hoe. Cup. Lie there base Midas bastard, that refuses All-honour'd love, and rail'st against the Muses. Exit. Clo. Oh coward, whatsoere thou art, to come behind a man and strike him before, for I saw no bodyâto shoot, and never give a man warning, oh coward; I am paid, I am pepper'd; the case is alter'd, for any one may ghesse by the hugenesse of the blow, that I am mightily in love; ay-me that any wench were here, whose name is Ayme; now could I be in love with any madge, though she were an Howlet, or with any maid, though she look't like a Malkin; Oh Poetry, I find that I am poyson'd with thee too; for me-thinks I could say my prayers in blanck-verse, nay let me see, I thinke I could rime for a neede; Cupid I yeeld since so I know thy will is, And Ile goe seeke me out some Amarillis. Exit. Enter Psiche alone. Psiche. There's at this time a combat in my soule, Whether to trust my well-knowne sisters better, Or my unseene husband; I have asked, Demanded, and enquired of all my traine, This fairy-traine that hourely waites on mee, Yet none of them will tell mee what hee is; Enter Cupid. Besides, this solitude to be alone, Begins to grow most tedious, and my feares Doe every way distract mee. Cup. Why how now Psiche? Psi. Oh let Mercies eyes Shine on my fault. Cup. Are these thy heaven-bound vowes? Are all thy protestations guilded ayre? Hast thou no more regard to my command, Or thine owne safety? Psi. Deare love pardon mee. Cup. Once more I doe; and still must pardon thee, And thou must still offend, still torture mee; Yet once againe Ile try thy constancy: Thy sisters are at hand. Psi. But gentle Love, Shall I not speake to them? Cup. Yes, but I woe thee To send them quickly hence, or they'le undoe thee; They now are at the Rock, bid the coole winde To please thee, bring them to the place assign'd. Exit. Enter Zephirus with the two Sisters. Psi. Ho Zephirus, Tell me the cause of your so quick returne? Asti. Psiche we come in danger of our lives. To save our sister from ensuing harme. Psi. What harme? what danger? Asti. Danger eminent, Once you refused our counsell, and deny'd To let us know your husband, or his name. Petr. Come let's see him. Psi. Oh, what shall I doe? Petr. Escape the danger you are falne into. Psi. You cannot see him. Asti. Give us then his shape? Psi. His shape, why he's a man whose snowy head Bowes on his bosome, through the weight of age. Asti. That cannot be; you said he was a youth Of comely stature, with long flaxen haire. Psi. I am entrap'd. Asti. Speak, did you ever see your husband? Psi. Why do you aske? pray trouble me no more; Leave me, and I will fill your laps with gold. Asti. Once thy gold tempted us to leave this place, And to betray thy life to misery, It shall not now, did not Apollo doome Thy fatall marriage to some hiddeous beast; How just is Phebus in his auguries; Last night, when we went hence laden with gold, We spide a serpenr gliding on the mead, Who at the sight of us, writhing his head Proudly into the ayre, first hist at heaven, Because it did not shade him from our eyes. Psi. How did that serpent vanish from your sight? Asti. In at these gates he rowld, Psiche be wise, For tho' a while he dally with thy beauty, Dalling thy taste with sweets, thy eyes with shews, Thy eares with musicke, and sweet lullabies, He will in time devour thee. Psi. Miserable wretch, How shall I flye the fate that followes me? Whose helpe shall I invoke? Petr. Tell us the truth, And wee'l devise some means to succour thee. Psi. You are my sisters, I confesse to you, I never saw his face, know not his shape, Yet have I touch'd his eyes, and felt his hands. Oft have I kist his cheekes, more oft his lips; Eyes, hands, lips, cheekes, and face so charm'd my touch, That I have sworne, save his, there were none such; Yet your strange story makes me to suspect That he's some serpent, for he tels me still, To see his glorious shape, will ruine me; Besides he bids me shun your company, Else you will breed my sorrow; this is that Which troubles me. Asti. Hear thee my counsell; Instantly provide A keen-edg'd Raysor, and a burning Lampe; At night, when sleep fits on his monstrous eyes, Steale from his speckled side, step to your light, And without seare behold his horrid shape, And with the Raysor cut his skaly throat; And so by death gaine life, and he being dead, Psiche shall to some King be married. Petr. How doth our sister relish this devise? Psi. I doe embrace your councell, and this night I'le put the same in execution; Come, you have made me resolute and bould, And now receive your laps o're-swell'd with gold. Exit. Asti. Swell in thy pride, untill thou break'st thy heart Yet come, we'll take her larges e're we part. Exit. Enter Midas and Apuleius. Mi. Poet no more, I have enough of Psiche; Her sisters and the sepent, all of them Most villanous lies, I'le prove it; and unlesse To please my selfe, and keep mine eyes from sleepe, Thou'lt let me shew thee some of our fine sport, Such as we use here in Arcadia, I will endure no longer. Ap. Well, I am pleas'd Mi. I'le shew thee in a Dance. Ap. Art some-times must give way to ignorance. A Dance. Enter Pan, Clowne, Swaines, and Countrey-wenches; They dance, and Exit. Mi. Was not this sport indeed? Ap. My modesty gives thee no reprehension, For I am well pleased with your Pastorall mirth; But as thou had'st a power over mine eyes, To sit it out wirh Patience; so lend me Thy attentive eares Mi. First cleere thy obsurdities. Nay, grose ones too; here Psiche lyes abominably, And sayes she has two husbands, the one yong, the other old: How canst thou answer this? Ap. Though thy vaine doubts be most familiar To these Judicious hearers, well experenc'd, As well in matters Morrall as Divine; To thee I'le make it plaine. Mi. I prethee doe. Ap. Did Psiche lye to say she had two loves? How like art thou to Psiche, she to thee. Mi. To me, I scorne her likenesse. Ap. In this point thou art, For rather than thy sisters shall grow angry, To make earths drossie pleasures stay for thee, Thou wilt exclaime with Psiche, Cupids young; The joyes of heaven are all too young, too little To be believ'd, or look'd at; if that faile, Thou with the soule wilt say, my love is old, Divine delights are crooked like old age, Who will not vow, speake, nay swear any thing, To have their vaine delights serv'd like a king. Mi. 'Tis pretty, but your Ecchoes pleas'd me best; Oh if a man had seen them. Ap. With a mortall eye none can; in them is hid this mistery, CÃ¦lestiall raptures, that to allure the sight, Are seen no more then voices being on high, Subject unto no weake, and fleshly eye. Mi. But why did Cupid hide himselfe from Psiche? Ap. Oh who dares prye into those mysteries, That heaven would have conceal'd; for this she's charg'd Not to see Cupids face, to shun her sisters. Mi. Those gadding girles, what didst thou mean by them? Ap. The restlesse sins that travell night and day, Envying her blisse, the sweet scule to betray. Mi. Well, by this little I conceive the rest, I care not greatly if I stay it out, But if not lik't, I'le either sleep or flout. Ap. So will not these I hope, before they view What horrid dangers Cupids bride pursue. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. III. Scene I. Enter Psiche in night-attyre, with a Lampe and a Raysor. Psi. Times eldest daughter Night, mother of ease, Thou gentle nurse, that with sweet lullabies, Care-waking hearts to gentle slumber charm'st? Thou smooth-cheek't negro night, the black-ey'd Queen, That rid'st about the world on the soft backs Of downy Ravens sleeke and sable plumes, And from thy Charriot, silent darkenesse flings; In which man, beast, and bird-inveloped, Takes their repose and rest; Psiche intreats thee, No Jar nor found betray her bold attempt: Cup. discovered sleeping on a bed. Soft silken vaile that curtains in my doubt, Give way to these white hands, these jealous eyes, Sharpe knife prepar'd for a red sacrifice; Bright Lampe conduct me to my love or hate, Make me this night blest or unfortunate: Wonderous amazement! what do I behold? A Bow and Quiver, these shafts tip'd with gold, With silver this, this sluggish arrowes head, Is like my heavy heart, compos'd of lead, Such weapons Cithereas Son doth beare, Psiche were happy if this Cupid were; Malicious sisters, I your envy see, This is no serpent, but a Deity: What pretty loves, like silken slumbers lie, Closing the covers of each Christall eye; Hence thou prepared instrument of death, Whilst Psiche sucks new life from his sweet breath: Churle beauty, beautious nigard, thus I'le chide, Why didst thou from mine eyes this glory hide? Ah me, thou envious light, what hast thou done? Cup. Immortall powers, oh succour Venus Son; What hellish hagg hath drop't this scalding oyle On Loves CelÃ¦stiall shape? Psi. 'Twas Psiche hand. Cup. How durst thou violate my dread command? Venus my mother, bid me make thee doat On some base groom; and I left her and heaven, And with mine owne dart wounded my owne brest; For all these favours, wouldst thou murder me? Psi. Let my weak sex plead for my great offence, Cup. No, for thy sake, this plague pursue thy sex; You shall have appetites, and hot desires, Which though supply'd, shall nere be satisfied: You shall be still rebellious, like the Sea, And like the windes inconstant; things forbid You most shall covet, loath what you should like; You shall be wise in wishes, but enjoying, Shall venture heavens losse for a little toying. Ho Zephirus. Enter Zephirus. Psi. What will my dear love do? Cup. Hence, touch me not, I'le be no more thy love: Discharge my servants from this fairy vaile, Resigne thy office to the boystrous North, Bid famine ride upon his frozen wings, Till they be blasted with his poysonous breath; Musicke, be turn'd to horror, smiles to teares, Pleasures to shreikes, felicity to feares. Psi. Why do you plague the place for my offence? Cu. Why for thy sisters sake sought'st thou my hate? But I will be reveng'd on them and thee, On them, for thy sake, on thy selfe for me. Psi. For pity heare poor Psiche. Cup. No away? Psi. I have no way but yours; which way you fly, I'le hang upon your wings, or fall and die. Cup. Soon shalt thou leave thy hold; run Zophirus. A storme. Enter Boreus. Fetch BoreusâArt thou come my Aquilon: Boreus, I charge thee by Orithias love, Lay waste and barren this faire flowry grove, And make this Paradise a den of snakes; For I will have it uglier then hell, And none but gastly scrieth-owles here shall dwell; Breath winters stormes upon the blushing cheekes Of beautious Psiche; with thy boysterous breath, Rend off her silkes, and cloathe her in torne rags; Hang on her loath'd locks base deformity, And beare her to her father, leave her there, Barren of comfort, great with child of feare; Psiche fare well, whilst thou with woes art crown'd I must go gather helpes to cure my wound. Exit. Psi. With woes indeed; those wretches live in woe, Whom love forsakes, and Psiche must do so. Exeunt with a great storme. Enter Clowne, Amarillis, and Swaines Clow. Do you hear the newes, you annimals? 1 Swa. Is it worth the hearing? Clow. A question well ask'd, for it is musicall newes, and therefore worth your ears: Apollo being call'd by Venus from heaven, hath ever since kept Admetus his sheep, with whom Pan meeting, they fell into contention, whether his pipe or Apollo's Harpe could yield the better Musicke, and which withall could sing the best; come then my sweet Amarillis, and take thy place amongst the rest, for this is the day of the tryall, and amongst others, I heard my father Midas say, that all other businesse set a part, he would be at it; but there is one mischief late happened. 1 Swa. What's that I prithee? Clo. Pan hath got a cold, is hoarse, and hath lost his voice, and therefore hath chose me to sing in his place; and PhÅbus, because he will take no advantage, hath pick'd out one of his Pages to do the like for him; therefore come, make a lane, for by this time they are upon their entrance. 1 Swa. But is it possible, that Pans Pipe dare contend with Apollo's Harpe? Clo. Yes that it is possible, blinde harper, and that my winde-pipe shall proove; make roome, and get you all out of the lists save I, that am to be one of the combatants. A Flourish. Enter Apollo, Pan, Admetus, Petrea, Astioche, their two husbands, and Midas Pan. Who shall be Judge? Apo. Admetus. Ad. Sacred Apollo, great Pan pardon me; It is a cunning much beyond my skill, Therefore I humbly crave to be excus'd. Apol. Admetus, for thy hospitality, PhÅbus will be thy friend, and give thee leave In this to use thy pleasure. Pan. What thinkes PhÅbus Of Midas, once of men, now King of beasts. Apol. No better man, so please him undertake it. Mi. Yes PhÅbus, Midas will, and though poor Marsias, For striving with thee had his skin pull'd off, Yet have we Swaines, and some too not farre off, I could have said, some neere to me in blood, Can tickle you for a tone. Clo. Meaning me, and I will set out a throat, Apol. Is this thy Champion? Pan. Yes, and who's for thee? Apo. One of my minuts, houres, dayes, weeks, or moneths, Or yeeres, or seasons, that still waite on us, And have done ever since the first of time; Not one can come amisse. Mi. Who shall begin? Ad. Most voices. All. Apollo, Apollo. Clo. No matter though his Champion begin, let me alone to come up with the Catastrophie. All. Silence, silence. Song. PhÅbus unto thee we sing, Oh thou great Idalian King, Thou the god of Physick art, Of Poetry, and Archery; We sing unto thee with a heart, Devoted to thy deity: All bright glory crowne thy head, Thou soveraigne of all Piety, Whose golden beames and rayes are shed As well upon the poore as rich, For thou alike regardest each; PhÅbus unto the we sing, Oh thou great Idalian King. I marry this was some-wat to th'purpose; I needs must say 'twas pretty, but god Pan, Now let us heare your Champion? Pan. Come, stand forth? Song. Clow. Thou that art call'd the bright Hiperion, Wert thou more strong than Spanish Gerion. That had three heads upon one man, Compare not with our great god Pan. They call thee Son of bright Latona, But girt thee in thy torrid zona, Sweat, baste and broyle, as best thou can, Thou art not like our Dripping Pan. What cares he for the great god Neptune, With all the broath that he is kept in; Vulcan or Jove, he scornes to bow to, To Hermes, or the infernall Pluto. Then thou that art the heavens bright eye, Or burne, or scorch, or boyle, or fry, Be thou a god, or be thou man, Thou art not like our frying Pan. They call thee PhÅbus, god of day, Yeers moneths, weeks houres, of March and May; Bring up thy army in the van, We'll meet thee with our Pudding Pan. Thy selfe in thy bright Charriot settle, With Skillet arm'd, Brasse-pot or Kettle With Iugg, Blackpot, with Glasse or Can, No talking to our Warming Pan. Thou hast thy beames, thy browes to deck. Thou hast thy Daphne at thy beck; Pan hath his hornes, Sirnjx, and Phillis, And I Pans Swaine, my Amarillis. Ad. You Midas have heard both; these only wait Your just and upright sentence. Mi. Is PhÅbus pleased? Ap. Pleased. Mi. And is Pan content. Pan. Content. Clow. Now if my father can but censure as well as I sing, the towne's ours. Mi. Yes Son, I can, and that most learnedly: Thy Harpe to Pans Pipe, yeeld god PhÅbus, For 'tis not now as in Diobus Illis, Pan all the yeere we follow, But semel in anno ridet Apollo, Thy quirester cannot come neere The voice of this our Chanticleere, Then leave off these thy burning rayes, And give to Pan the prick and praise, Thy colour change, look pale and wan, In honour of the great god Pan. All. A sentence, a sentence, a Pan, a Pan. Apol. Henceforth be all your rurall musicke such, Made out of Tinkers, Pans, and Kettle-drums; And never henceforth may your fields be grac'd With the sweet musick of Apollos lyre: Midas for thee, may thy eares longer grow, As shorter still thy judgement, dulnesse, and dotage, Be only govern'd with those reverend haires; Let all like thee, that as they grow in time, Decay in knowledge, have that old mans curse, To be twice children: for thy squeaking sonne, May all thy state thou leav'st him at thy death, Be to sing Ballets through Arcadia, And them to the like tunes; fare-well Admetus, My musicke lies unquestion'd, what's amisse Is not in us, but in their ignorance; Thus undisparadg'd, PhÅbus leaves the place, And with them to succession, my disgrace. Exit. Ad. PhÅbus is gone displeas'd. Pan. Still may he be so. Mi. Midas I'me sure has judg'd with equity. A Storme. Enter Psiche and Boreas. Clo. But see father, see god Pan, if in revenge, he hath not sent a blustering wind to blow us all hence; 'tis Boreas, 'tis Boreas. Pan. Come Midas, come Swaines, till this storme be past, Let us away to shelter. Exeunt. Psi. Where art thou Psiche, how art thou deform'd? What ayre affords thee breath? what men be these? Where shall I hide me; let no humane eye Behold me thus disfigured, and asham'd: My Father, Brothers, and my Sisters too, That wrought my fall, what shall poore Psiche do? Ad. What bare anotomy of griefe is this, That glads mine eare with sound of Psiches name? Psi. 'Tis her owne tongue, the herald of her shame; Father Admetus, Sisters pitty me. Ad. Thou art no childe of mine. Asti. Spurne her away, 'Tis some infectious strumpet, and her breath Will blast our cheeks; her sight is worse than death. Psi. I did not use you thus, nor spurne you back, When on the nimble wings of Zephirus, You were transported into Cupids vaile; Your entertainment then deserv'd more right, Then like a dog, thus spurne me from your sight; Sisters. Petr. Out hagge, we scorne thy sister-hood. Psi. You scorne me too; nay then at last I see, pride will not looke on base deformity: Father Admetus, pitty wretched Psiche. Kneels. Ad. Out impudence; if once againe thy tongue Mangle the reputation of my girle, I'le have it straight torne out, hence with th'Impostor, Psi. Us'd like a dogge, and by a fathers doom, Dragg'd from his presence, how am I transform'd? Ile try my brothers next, upon my knees, Zel. Depart the place, for me, I know thee not. Psi. Oh me, how quickly wretches are forgot? Me. Wretched, away. Psi. Away; all cry away, Basenesse and pride in one place cannot stay: Astioche, kind sister, for old loves, Resolve my father that I am his child; Put him in mind of PhÅbus oracle, And leaving me upon the barren Rock; Remember how you came unto my bower, And how my servants fill'd your laps with gold; And last, remember how by your advise, I made attempt to strike my husband dead, As he was sleeping, do you know me now? Thence grew my misery. Asti. Yes foole, and my great heart Joyes in thy fall: and father, now I better Survey her, my mind gives me this is Psiche. Petr. I am of her thought too, and yet much wonder, How such a beauty should be so deform'd. Ad. None shall perswade me to't; she's none of mine That tells me I have any part in her. Recorders. Cupid descends. Cup. Admetus stay, chide thy conceit, it offers wrong unto thy daughter Psiche. Psi. Oh what heavenly tongue Will once vouchsafe to sound poor Psiches name, Torne with disgrace, doubly expos'd to shame. Cup. Psiche, his tongue, whose charge had'st thou obey'd, Thy prosperous state had not been so betray'd; Nor hadst thou bin a subject to that shame Which now attends thee. Psi. Cupid, my dear lord, Pardon my gilt, have pity on my sorrow? Cup. I cannot, no I dare not, heaven, and earth, The destinies, and all th'Immortall powers, Have with the yron pen of Fate, writ downe Thy certaine paine; did I not give thee charge, To taste the pleasures of Immortall love, But not to wade too deep in mystery? Could not my heavenly company suffice To cheere the soule? but thou with earthly eyes Must see my face; and view my reall beauty, Against my charge, thy love, and humane duty. Psi. I do intreat. Cup. Arise, kneel not to me; But thanke thy sisters, they apparrell'd thee In that distractfull shape; Psiche fare well, I'le mourne in heaven, to see thy paines in hell. Cupid ascends. Ad. Poor miserable childe; in stead of teares, My heart weeps blood; I am confounded quite: I have three daughters, thou of all the rest, Had'st in my true conceptions greatest share, For which, I call'd thee Psiche, that's the soule, For as my soule I lov'd thee; now I abjure All interest in thy birth; hence from my Court? My hand shall nere lay blessing on thy head, Nor my tongue grace thee with a daughters name, Thou art not mine, but the base birth of shame. Psi. Oh whether shall a wretch convert her eyes, When her owne father shall her teares despise? Enter Mercury. Mer. Atend Arcadians, The Proclamation of the Paphian Queen. Ad. When Hermes speakes, we are bound to all attendance. Mer. Oh yes, If any can bring Psiche unto Venusâ Asti. Psiche, whom you are sent to seek, stands there. Mer. Then here ends Mercuries Commission: Psiche, in Venus name, I do arrest thee, For wrongs to her and Cupid. Psi. I obey Your high arrest, and with an humble suit, Prostrate my selfe to Citherias wrath; Where's angry Venus? Mer. Frantick in this grove, Mourning Adonis death,âand here she comes. Enter Venus. Ven. Accursed bow, why didst thou not defend him? He shall not die, Adonis still shall live; Apollo, gentle PhÅbus mount thy Charriot, And in his cold brest breathe CÃ¦lestiall fire, For all earths simples cannot cure his wound; Or if he must expire, command the Muses To give my love Immortall memory: Hast thou found Psiche? oh that in this rage, I could but now forget her. Mer. See where she stands, With down-cast eyes, and weak up-heaved hands. Ven. Just of my height, state, and my proportion; And were her pristine beauty lent her backe, Might in the rabbles judgement rivall me: Strumpet, prophaner of our sacred rights, How hast thou wrong'd me, and abus'd my son? By ayming at my honour and his life. Psi. Dread Paphian Queen, for lovely Cupids sake, And this rich burthen in my wretched wombe, Pitty poore Psiche. Ven. Hast thou plaid the strumpet, And for thy sins sake, must I pardon thee? No, that alone hath made me mercilesse. Venus beats her. Psi. Helpe me dear father, sisters, Mercury. Ad. I dare not speak for thee. Asti. Nor I. Petr. Nor I. Psi. Poor Psiche, borne unto adversity. Mer. Be not so bitter Madam, for his sake, By whom you are made a grandam. Ven. I prove a grandame to a strumpets brat? Go Mercury, and from some Garner fetch Five measures of five severall sorts of graine; Dispatch it Hermes. Mer. What will Venus do? Ven. Thou shalt know better when thou backe returnst: Exit. Mercury. You are yong Venus, and the Queen of Love, That had th'ambition to be Cupids wife, And marry with a god; Ho Boreas, Since Mercury is slack in his returne, Wind her inticing locks about thy arme, And tossing her loose carcasse in the ayre, Fling it into the bosome of some storme, And grind her bones to powder in the fall. Psi. Pity me Venus, father plead for me. Enter Mercury with graine. Ven. 'Tis well done Hermes, hast thou brought the grain? Mer. I have. Ven. Then minion, here's your taske, Look on all these; see, thus I mingle them. Psi. And what must miserable Psiche do? Ven. To severall heaps, with thine owne hands divide Each severall seed ere the Sun kisse the West, Or look for death; go, and when that is done, Ile ride to Paphos and enlarge my sonne, Whom yet I keep close prisoner in my closet. Ad. Psiche adieu, none can reverse thy doom. Asti. Not I. Mene. Nor we. Exit. all but Mer. and Psi. Psi. I wish the earth my tombe. Mer. Take patience Psiche, and be comforted. Psi. Comfort, alas what comfort can she find, Whose father and dear friends prove so unkind. Mer. For Cupids sake, who for thy love, now weares A paire of golden shackles on his heeles: This Mercury will do, flie hence to Paphos, And fetch him from his late imprisonment, Then tell him of his mothers tyranny, That done, we two will teach thee, without paine, In severall heaps how to divide this graine. Exeunt. Enter Midas and Apuleius Mi. And where have I been think'st thou Apuleius, Didst thou not misse me? Ap. Yes, I did not sleep as thou didst in thy judgment. Mi. Then I perceive, Thou know'st how I maintain'd our rurall musicke, Preferring it before Apollos Harpe. Ap. Yes, and by that infer, thou art all earthly, Nothing CÃ¦lestiall in thee. Mi. All's one for that; now for your morrall. Ap. Wilt thou stay it out? Mi. No, 'tis too dull, Vnlesse thou'lt quicken me with some conceit, Thy Psiches sadnesse hath made me so heavy, That Morpheus steales upon me. Ap. What wouldst thou see? Mi. Thy little Cupid I like pretty well, And would see something else what he can do, More then belongs to Psiche. Ap. Well, to keep thee awake, I'le shew thee now Loves Contrarieties, Which was more then my promise. A Dance. Enter a King and a Beggar, a Young-man and an Old woman, a Leane man, a Fat woman. Dance, &amp; Exit. Mi. I marry, this was somewhat like indeed; Here's yong and old, here's fat and leane; the begger and the King; Love hath power over all. But to your morrall now; why comes your Psiche With a sharpe Raysor, and a burning Lampe, To murder Cupid; then he wakes and chafes, And flings the house out at windowes, was't not so? Ap. I'le tell thee; she charm'd by her sisters tongues, Thinks her faire love a serpent, and growne mad, Would murder Cupid, teare even Iove from heaven; Yet note the greatnesse of CÃ¦lestiall mercy; One glimpse, one lampe, one sparke, one divine thought Plucks back her arme, and more inflames her brest With amorous raptures; but because poore soule, She aym'd to search forbidden mysteries, Her eyes are blasted, Cupid loathes her sight, He leaves her ugly, and his blessed bower Is rent in pieces; For heaven seems to fall When our poor soules turne diabollicall. Mi. For that 'twixt Pan and PhÅbus, I know best, For I was there an umpire; but resolve me; Why left he Psiche when she lost his love, Yet mourn'd when she was left of all her friends. Ap. All bid the wretched soule run to despaire, When leprous sin deformes her, but even then, When the gods hate her? when she's scorn'd of men? Cupid hangs in the ayre; his divine eyes Shed teares for her, comforts her miseries. Mi. Yet he forsook her too. Ap. Till Psiche be made faire, and angel-white, She's not to stand in Cupids glorious sight. Mi. Well, I am answer'd. Ap. For thy part Midas, Laugh, sleep, or flout, nay snarle, and cavell too; Which none of these here met I hope will do. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. IIII. Scene I. Enter Vulcan. Vul. Within here, ho Pirackmon, when you knave? Take in Adonis quiver, and his bow, And hang them up in Venus armory, By Mars his gantlet, and Achilles sword: Ha, ha, ha, I laugh untill my sides be sore, For joy that my wives dandiprat is dead; And now my Ciclops lay't on lustily; There's halfe a hundred Thunder-bolts bespoak, Which argues that the world is full of sin; Neptune hath broke his Mace, and Junos Coach Must be new mended, and the hind-most wheels Must have two spoaks set in; PhÅbus fore-horse Must have two new shooes, calk'd, and one remove; Pans Sheep-hook must be mended shortly too, Plic it of all hands, we have much to do. 1. Ciolop, from within. Ci. Master, here's one of Ceres husband-men Would have a Plough-share, and a Sythe new ground. Vul. New ground, new halter'd, he shall stay his turne; We shall deceive the gods and goddesses, For a plow-jogging hinde. 2 Ci. Here's Mercury to have his Caduces mended. Vul. He shall stay. 3 Ci. Here's Ganimed, To have his masters hunting-nagge new shod; And Mars his lackie, with a broken gorget. 4 Ci. And here's a clowne for hob-nailes. Vul. Here's the devill and all; What would they have me do? I toyle and moyle Worse than a mill-horse, scarce have kept a minute This fortnight, and odde dayes; I have not time To sit and eat; But I'le give over all, And live upon my wife as others do; They say she hath good takings; ere I'le endure it, I will do any thing; when I was made a Smith, Would I had been a Beare-ward. 4 Ci. What shall we do first? Vul. Why first go hang your selves: I keep a douzen Journey-men at least, Besides my Ciclops and my Prentises, Yet 'twill not fadge; I thinke my little boy Cupid must blow the bellowes, and my Wife Venus must leave her trade, and turne she-smith, Yet 'twould scarce quit the cost; she'd spend me more In Nectar and sweet-balls to scowre her cheeks, Smudg'd and besmear'd with cole-dust and with smoak, Then all her worke would come to; But soft, what shackled run-away is this? Enter Cupid in Fetters. Why how now Cupid? Cup. Crawling softly to you, You are my dad, and I am come to see you. Vul. How came you out of credit with your Mother? Cup. Aske me how I crept into credit rather, For do you see sir; thus the matter stands, I am indebted, and thus enter'd bands To be forth-comming. Vul. Y'are a yong whore-master; about your wench, I have heard all; but where's your mother now? Cup. Binding up Mirtles for Adonis Tombe, Whom she hath now turn'd to a Hiacnith? Vul. And what's become of Psiche, where is she? Cup. I parted but even now with Mercury, Who told me that my mother had enjoyn'd her To part five measures of commixed graine Into five heaps, which seem'd impossible; But he and I sent forth the toyling Ants, Who like so many earnest labourers, Did it with ease, for they were numberlesse: Then with his cunning, having pick'd the locke Of Venus Closet dore, he set me free, And I am come dear father, to intreat, To file off these my bolts. Vul. Cupid I dare not, Venus gave me charge, Not to take off thy shackles. Cup. Father, sweet Hony sugar-candy dad, Indeed, indeed you shall. Vul. This cologing wagge Will not be answered: come, set up your leg; Venus will sole me by the eares for this. Cup. No, no, I warrant you. Enter Psiche with a Violl. Vul. So, now 'tis done, th'art free;âbut who comes here? She's angry sure for see how big she looks; What a great breadth she beares; me thinks a woman Becomes no ornaments she wears, so well As a great-belly; therefore 'tis much pity, They should want things, to make them look so pritty. Psi. Vnhappy Psiche, Venus most obdure, And never satiate with my endlesse cares, When by the helps of silly labouring Ants, I had ended the first taske, her cruelty Binds me to worse disaster. Cup. Once my Love, Hadst thou been true to Cupid, not the least Of all these evills had assaulted thee; And till my mothers anger be appeas'd, I dare do nothing; Yet for our first loves sake, Make me acquainted, with thy second taske, And as I may be sure I'le further it. Psi. Let my lips kisse this earth whereon you tread, In low submission; for her late injunction, Transcends all humane possibility: This Violl I must fill at that spring-head, From whence Cocitus flowes, that fearfull stream, Which feeds the River Stix. Cup. Be advis'd by me, Not far from Tenerus, whose barren top Is crown'd with clouds of smoak, there lies a mead, Ore-growne with Osiers, Bryars, and Sicamors, In this Ioves Eagle (on whose duskie wings, Ganimed flew to heaven) obscures himselfe From Jealous Iunoes wrath; enquire him out, Tell him thy grief, and that thou cam'st from me, From this hard taske he will deliver thee. Psi. Thanks glorious deity, upon my knees, Prest downe with this rich burthen of thy love, I beg that you will mediate 'twixt my errours, And your sterne mothers wrath. Cup. Well get thee gone, 'Tis I will front her indignation. Exit. Psiche. Enter Pan and Venus. Pan. This way he ran with shackles on his heels, And said he would to Vulcan: oh but see Where he stands cogging with him. Ven. Now you run-away, You disobedient, thou unhappy wagg, Where be the golden fetters I left you bound in? Cup. True, for my good behaviour, but you see My bands are cancell'd, and your son set free. Ven. I'le whip you for't, with nettles steept in wine. Cup. So you'll nettle me, and I must smart for't; But when your owne flames burne, and you desire With him, or him, to glut your appetite, Then gentle Cupid, then, my pritty sonne, My love, my dear, my darling, and what not, Till you have had your will. Ven. With his flattering tongue, He still prevents my anger: but for thee, As crooked is thy manners as thy shape; I thought, great fool, you durst not harbor him. Vul. No more I did, sweet wife. Cup. Sweet mother Queen, busse my black dad, for all that he hath done, Was love to you, and kindnesse to your son. Vul. Speak for me Pan, as ere thou hop'st to have Thy broken hook well mended, Pan. When, canst tell? I tell thee, I must first have besides that, A douzen of Branding-irons to marke my flocke, (The time drawes neer, sheep-shearing is at hand) Besides, two of my Satirs falling out About a Lambe, one of them burst his horne, It must be tip'd too; thou art well acquainted With tipping hornes. Vul. Ha hornes, with hornes, how's that? Pan. Nay aske your Wife, I cannot speak of hornes, But still you take the last word to your selfe, For Venus makes, and Vulcan weares, And Vulcan takes, and Venus beares. Vul. Vulcan wear hornes? Ven. No sweet-heart, you mistake, Pan is the forked god, with hornes was borne, And ever since, his tongue runs of the horne. Pan. Speak shall I have my Sheep-hook, and those Irons? Vul. Yes Pan, you shall, But yet those hornes have strucke deep to my heart. Pan. Take heed they grow not upward to your head, And tipping hornes, your browes wear hornes indeed: Enter Psiche, But who comes here? Vulcan is this your wench? T'hadst best look to him Venus. Psi. Like your obediens servant, that layes downe Her life and labour at her Mistris feet, So comes poor Psiche, held between the armes Of fear and duty; feare dishartning me, Would pluck me back, but duty being more strong, Bids me go forward, bending my weak knee Before the Shrine of sacred Majesty; Accept my service, who to gaine your grace, Would yeeld my selfe to ashie death's imbrace. Ven. Is this that water of th'Infernall lake? Psi. This is that water whose infectious torrent Runs from Cocitus, into Flegiton, Infernall Stix, and the black Acheron, Deare goddesse. Ven. Art thou not a fawning counterfeit? First I imploy'd thee to divide my graine, A taske impossible for mortall hands, This second as more hard, and yet 'tis done; Thou work'st by sorcery; but no damn'd spell Shall keep me from my wrath, thy soule from hell. Vul. Venus, sweet mouse, nay prithee do not chide, Forgive, as I forgive thee. Ven. Polt-foot, peace. Cup. Sweet mother, let your ire be mollified, Since for her fault she hath endur'd this paine, Banish all hate and make her blest againe. Ven. Againe I charge thee not to speak for her: Once more I'le try thee further, since thy heart Is wedded to such hellish sorcery; Hye to Proserpina, the black-brow'd Queen, I'le send thee on my embassie to hell, Tell her that sicknesse, with her ashy hand, Hath swept away the beauty from my cheeks, And I desire her send me some of hers; Fetch me a boxe of beauty then from hell, That's thy last labour, urge not a reply, Do my command and live, refuse, and die. Cup. For my sake, my best Mother, pitty her. Ven. For thee I hate her, and for her hate thee. Pan. Nay gentle Venus, be more mercifull, For her great-bellies sake. Ven. For that alone, I'le hate you all, till she be fled and gone. Psi. Then go I must, and going nere returne; Oh Cupid my inconstancy to thee, Is cause of this my endlesse misery. Cup. With-draw thee Psiche. till the rest be gone, Anon I'le speak with thee. Exit. Psiche Enter Mercury. Mer. Venus, Vulcan, Cupid, and god Pan, I summon you to appeare at Ceres plaine, To entertaine the faire Proserpina. For whom I now am sent; I must to hell About Ioues embassie, Venus farewell. Exit. Ven. Hermes farewell, we'll meet at Ceres plentious Court: Come Cupid, follow me. Pan. Vulcan cannot go. Vul. Yes, but 'tis best to keep behind a shrew. Pan. Then put her in before, on Venus, go. Ex. all but Cup. Cup. Psiche approach, but do not come too neer, That pride thou hast already bought too deer. Enter Psiche. Psi. Oh pity Psiche, she is sent to hell. Cup. It is the sound of hell wakes pities eye. Else I had left thee to more misery; My loves not done, though thou art quite undone, Vnlesse I arme thee 'gainst the darts of death, Which hell aimes at thee. Psi. Let thy sacred breathâ Cup. Wound me no more with words, for they but grieve me; Now marke what on thy Journey must relieve thee: First, hye thee to the bancks of Acheton, Thou can'st not misse the way, 'tis broad and worne With trampling of ten Thousand passengers, There shalt thou find hells churlish Ferry-man, His name is Charon, there's to pay his hire, Take heed thou loose it not, for doing so, He'le beat, and leave thee on the shore of woe; Being ferried over, thou shalt spie hell gates, Thou need'st not knocke, they are open night and day, Give Cerberus a sop, and passe away. Psi. And what's that Corborus? Cup. Porter of hell, Who must at thy returne be brib'd againe; My great desire to helpe thee, hinders thee, I should have told thee when in Charons barge, Thou art wasting ore the dreadfull waves of Stix, An aged man, with a pale countenance, His name's Oblivion, swimming in the flood, Will heave his wither'd armes, and cry helpe, helpe, Save me from drowning; stretch not forth thy hand, For if thou dost, thou nere return'st to shore, Thou wilt forget my love, see me no more. Psi. Ile stop mine eares against Oblivions cry. Cup. Being landed, thou shalt see old wrinkled haggs, Spinning black threds, whilst folly reels them up; He will let fall his reele, and pray thee reach it, But stoop not; they will likewise beckon thee To sit downe by them; but to spin a thred, Take heed, doing so, from me thou art banished. Psi. Ile shun their baits. Cup. Being enter'd Plutoes Court, They all will tice thee with a thousand traines, Shun all, and neither sit nor eat with them, Only deliver what thou art enioyn'd, Receive the boxe of beauty, and be gon, Which still keep shut, let not thy daring eye Behold the wealth that in the boxe doth lie. Psi. Dread Cupidâ Cup. Now fare-well, hadst thou but obey'd me, Thy face had still bin lovely, and mine eye Doated on thee with heavenly Jealousie. Exeunt. Enter Clowne and Swaines. 1. Swa. And what dost thou think of Cupid now? Clo. Doe not think I am so stupid, But to think well of great god Cupid. 2. Swa. And what of Poets? Clo. As Poets, as of Potentates, for since I plaid the last prize against PhÅbus, in which I may say of my selfe, veni, vidi vici; I have bin so troubled with a Poeticall itch, that I can scratch you out Rimes, and Ballats, Songs, and Sonnetts, Oades, and Madrigalls, till they bleed againe. 1. Swa. Then thou art reconcil'd to Homer. Clo. Homer was Honourable, Hesiod Heroicall, Virgil a Vicegerent, Naso Notorious, Martiall a Provost. Juvinall a Joviall lad, and Persius a Paramount; what doe I think of Poetry? of which my selfe am a profest member. 2. Swa. And may be very well spar'd, and yet the body never the worse, but thou may'st see what becoms of rayling against Cupid, what a sweet Mistris hee hath put upon thee? Clo. Who, my Amarillis. 1. Swa. Yes, the veriest dowdy in all Arcadia, even Mopsa compar'd with her, shewes like a Madam; first she's oldâ Clo. It was very well said, to say first, because she was before us, and for old, is not age reverend? and therefore in mine eyes she's honourable. 1. Swa. And wrinkled. Clo. Is't not the fashion; doe not our Gentiles weare their haire crisped, the Nimphs their gownes pleated, and the Fawns their stockings, for the more grace, wrinkled; doth not the earth shew well when 'tis plowed, and the land best when it lyes in furrowes. 1. Swa. Besides, shee hath a horrible long nose. Clo. That's to defend her lipps, but thou finner to sence, and renegade to reason, do'st thou blame length in any thing? do'st thou not wish thy life long, and know'st thou not that Trueth comes out at length; When all our joyes are gone and past, doth not Long-look'd for, come at last; If any of our Nimphs be wrong'd, will she not say, 'tis Long of me, 'tis Long of thee, or Long of him; If they buy any comodity by the yard, do they not wish it long; your advocate wishes to have a law suit hang Long; And the poore client, be his cloak never so short, and thred-bare, yet would be glad to weare it longer. No married man, but doth his wife much wrong. Tho' he himselfe be short, to have nothing long. 2. Swa. The short and the long on't is, she's an ugly creature, make of her what thou can'st, Clo. Make of her what I can; oh that all, or any of you could like me, looke upon her with the eyes of Poetry, I would then let you know what I have made of her. 1 Swa. Prithee let's hear't. Clow. Then listen hither, 'oh you Imps of ignorance; Oh tell me, have you ever seen, Since you were borne unto this day Which is long since a wit so green, And cover'd with a head so gray. To praise her still my Muses will is, Although therein I have no cunning, Yet is the nose of Amarillis Like to a cock, long, and still running. Her eyes, though dimme, do seem cleer, And they of Rheume can well dispose, The one doth blinke, the other blear, In Pearl-drops striving with her Nose. Her brests are like two beds of blisse, Or rather like two leane-Cowes udders; Which shewes that she no change-ling is, Because they say, such were her mothers. Those few teeth left her in her head Now stand like hedge-stakes in her gumms, Full of white Dandriff is her head, She puts the Cobler downe for thums. Her sides be long, her belly lanke, And of her leggs what should I say, But that she feels well in the flanke, And both her feet, themselves display. 1 Swa. All the Homers in Asia could never have come so neer the businesse. Clo. From head to foot, for her stature and yeers, patterne her in all Arcadia; say she be a foule beast in your eyes, yet she is my Hyren; and shewing foule to others, and faire to me, I shall live the happier, and she the honester, but I have a remedy against all this, in spight of Cupid. 2 Swa. What's that? Clo. I heare Psiche his Mistris, is sent to hell for a boxe of beauty, 'tis but way-laying of her, and taking it from her, then Amarillis shall compare with any other she that dare. Exeunt. Enter Midas and Apulcius. Mi. This last I lik't, and had it all been such, Only a meer discourse 'twixt Swaines and Clownes, It then had pleas'd me; now some quaint device, Some kick-shaw or other to keep me waking. Ap. Then by the leave of these spectators here, I'le suite me to thy low capacity; Of Vulcans Ciclops Ile so much intreat, That thou shalt see them on their Anvile beat; 'Tis musicke fitting thee, for who but knowes, The vulgar are best pleas'd with noyse and showes? A Dance of Vulcan and his Ciclops. Mi. Well, this I like: Now let me know the creame of this conceit; Why graine? why measures? why the number five? Your morrall sir for that. Ap. The number five, our Sences doth include, Those severall graines, our severall sorts of sinnes, Which like those seeds, to count, are infinite; And so commixt, that to distinguish them, It much transcends humane capacitie. Mid. And then those Ants, what didst thou meane by them? Ap. By those are ment our recolections, And Laborinths, still busied in the search Of what hath past, and were it possible, By drawing them into their former heapes, To pay to each, indebted penitence; But all in vaine, for this can never bee Without true Love, guided by Mercury: But for my Sceane, how do'st thou relish that? Mid. As ribble, rabble, and I know not what; A Violl must be fill'd with stigian dropps, And that an Eagle must for Psiche fetch; And all this, to what purpose? Apu. What to thee, And such like drones, seemes to bee most absur'd, Is to the wise, perspicuous and most plaine? When Psiche hath transgressed, and her offence (Almost past pardon) merrits Cupids wrath, Then woes like waves, follow each others neck, Then must shee fetch a glasse of stigian water, A Violl fill'd with true repentant teares, And that shee cannot fill, nor fetch from thence, But by the Eagles help, Heavens providence. Mid. But for her voyage into Hell; can'st make mee Believe, that once there, shee can come from thence? Ap. Can'st thou be silent, and but apprehend Thou now behold'st her sit in Charons boate? Oblivion reaching up his wretched hands, To crave her helpe, and then by folly woed, Next by the Idle sisters; these things past, Entring Hell gates, whither thy imagination May bring her, Howsoever Gentlemen, I hope you will that better understand; Wee'le but affright her with Hells Court, and then, On your wing'd thoughts bring her to earth agen. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. V. Scene. I. Enter Pluto, Proserpine, Minos, Eacus, Rhadamant Charon, Cerberus and Mercury. Plu. Faire Mayas Sonne, declare your embassie? Mer. Wheate-crowned Ceres, harvest Soveraine, And Mother to the faire Proserpine, Sends greeting to her Sonne, hells awfull King, Letting him know, this day Latonas Sonne Enters the first house of his Zodiake, And with his guilt beames welcomes in the Spring; This day the Virgins of Sicilia, Old wives, young Children, Souldiers, Citizens, Princes and Prelates, on Cissephus bankes, Are gathered in well-order'd multitudes, Dancing in Chorusses, singing mirth-full layes, Such as Iambe Megamiraes maid, Sung, when she mourn'd her Daughters ravishment: This day hath Ceres call'd a Sessions, Where Proserpine must bee; but ere shee leave The black Imperiall Throne of this low world, Psiche the Daughter to th'Arcadian King, Must doe a message to her deitie. Pro. Wee know th'Intent of that great influence, With all the purpose of the Paphian Queene, Shee meanes prowd Esiche never shall returne, And wee will keep her; Cbaron fetch her ore. Cha. Shee's come already. Mino. Then conduct her in. Cha. Hell's full enough of shrewes; if shee be faire, I know shee's curst, pray let her tarry there, A curst queanes tongue, the very feinds still feare. Plu. Fetch her I say, Venus shall be reveng'd. Eac. Go Charon, wait upon him Cerberus. Mino. If she performe the customes of our Court, Being sent on message from supernall powers, We can then with no justice keep her here. Rha. True Minos, 'tis the law of hell and Fate; Yet Cerberus and Charon, get you gone, Tell Psiche that hells king, and Proserpine, With Minos bench'd, Eachus and Radamant, Vpon their black tribunalls, sends for her; You Furies with your envious eyes attend, Lest Psiche 'gainst our customes shall offend. Cha. Come Cerberus, come haggs, fetch Psiche in. Cer. Yes, and for all her staynes and leprosie, Me-thinks I now could eat her. Exit. Mer. Psiche is well instructed Rhadamant, Her husband Cupid gave her certaine rules, For her uncertaine journey. Enter Charon, Cerberus, and Psiche. All. Here she comes. Cer. My sopp, hast thou thy naulum Ferry-man? Cha. I have. Plu. Psiche stand forth, nay poor soul, tremble not. Minos. How came this woman over Acheron? Reach'd she not hand to helpe Oblivion? Cha. No, yet the wretch made a pitious cry, Yet she look'd on him with a scornefull eye. Eac. How did she passe the haggs, that spunne the threds Of Idle-folly, in the path of hell? Cha. They all desir'd her helpe, but she deny'd To set a finger unto follies thred. Plu. She hath done well, why kneel'st thou on the ground? Psi. I kneel to Proserpine, for I am sent By sacred Venus for a boxe of beauty. Pros. Faire Psiche, you shall have what you desire, Rise up, sit downe by us, 'tis much unfit, The wife of Cupid on the ground should sit. Psi. Psiche is Cupids out-cast, and his scorne, And therefore sits thus low, and thus forlorne. Plu. Oh thou belov'd of Loue, be not so sad; Furnish a Banquet, let our cousen taste The delicates that grow in these darke groves. Pros. Art thou not faint? A Banquet set forth. Psi. Yes, wonderous faint and weary, Faint through the want of food, weary with toyle Of my un-number'd steps, faint through the terror That on each side affrights me, faint and weary With bearing this poor burthen in my wombe; Cupid, thy words are true, thou didst fore-tell, My pride on earth, should worke my plagues in hell. Plu. Refresh thy selfe then, taste our delicates. Psi. I dare not touch them. Rha. Thou hast a sop, eat that. Psi. It is not mine, It is your Porters fee. Cer. Give it me then. Psi. Anon I will, at my returne from hence; In the mean time, sacred Proserpina, By all the teares your grieved mother shed, When you were stole from Pismaes flowry banke, Let Psiche be dispatched to Cipria, Lest the incensed goddesse do some wrong To her poor servant, if she stay too long. Plu. Will she not sit? scornes she to take our food? Give her some wine. Cha. Here girle, drinke to hells King. Psi. Give me cold water from the murmuring spring? Plu. I am soul-vext, that any mortall eye Should see our Customes, and returne alive, To blab them to the wide eare of the world: But Proserpine, having perform'd all rights, We must not here detaine her; send her hence. Pros. My envy equalls yours, but all in vaine; Psiche receive this boxe from Proserpine, Wherein CÃ¦lestiall beauty is inclos'd. But on thy life, dare not to look into't, As thou respect'st thy safety. Psi. I receive it, And humbly begging to dread Plutoes Queen, Intreat to be dismiss'd this fearfull Court. Plu. Charon, convey her back. Cha. My Ferry-money. Cer. My sopp. Psi. Both's here. Exit. Cha. and Cer. with Psiche. Plu. Psiche is worthy to be Pupids wife, And Proserpine, remember her to Venus, Make intercession that the Queen of Love No longer prove th'ungentle step-mother. Mer. Pluto, when Psiche hath perform'd her taske, My sister will no doubt be reconcil'd; Cupid presented a petition To Jove, and all the Senate of the gods, To take from her, her base deformity, The gods agreed, and Venus too was pleas'd At her returne from hell it should be done. Plut. Here Hermes, take my Queen Proserpina, Returne her when the sister of the Sun Hath sixe times compassed her silver spheare; Commend me to my mother, great Joves wife, My sister Pallas, and to all the gods, So fare-well Plutoes joy, all hell shall mourne With hiddeous cries till my faire love returne. Exeunt. Hiddeous Musicke. Enter Cupid. Cup. Many a long look have my watchfull eyes, Sent out to meet with Psiche, here she comes, Enter Psiche. And in her hand the boxe, Cupid stand close, And over-heare the summe of her discourse. Enter Clowne. Clo. This is she, I know her by her marter'd face; Venus did well to send her for beauty, for poore soul she hath need on't' I have dogg'd her, to see if I could find her at any advantage, to steal away her boxe; I have already got love from Cupid; I have got Poetry from Apollo, and if I could now get beauty from Psiche, Phaou the fair Ferry-man, was never so famous in Sicillia, as I Coridon shall be in Arcadia. Psi. You trayterous thoughts, no more assault me thus, My lovely Cupid charg'd me not to see What Proserpine sent Venus in this boxe, The like command did hells Queen lay on me, Oh heaven, yet I shall die except I do't. Cup. I Psiche, what still in your longing vaine? Clo. That's it, nay I shall know't, if I see't againe, Psi. It's beauty Psiche, and CÃ¦lestiall, And thou art ugly, this will make thee shine, And change this earthly forme to shape divine; Open it boldly, but I shall offend, Why say I do, 'tis but the breach of duty, And who'll not venture to get heavenly beauty, Rich beauty, ever fresh, never decaying, Which lies entombed in this heavenly shrine; Nor in this bold attempt thinke me prophane, Striving thus spotted, to be free from staine. She opens the boxe and fals asleep. Clo. Nay I thought I should take you napping, And thou shalt go with me; for 'tis my duty, My Mistris being a blowse, to find her beauty, Cupid charmes him asleep Cup. To make thee lovely in thy Mistris eyes, Make use of that, and boast of thy rich prize. Cupid layes a counterfeit Boxe by him. But foolish girle; alas why blame I thee, When all thy Sex is guilty of like pride, And ever was? but where's this beauty now? Turn'd into slumbers, and like watery pearles Of honey-tasting dew hangs on these lids: She wakes againe: I have swept off the slumber That hung so heavy on these spotted covers, Which once clos'd in, the light of all true lovers. Psi. Where am I now? dread Cupid pardon me. Cup. Come rise, and wipe away these fruitlesse teares; Take up the boxe, and hie thee to my Mother? Psi. She'll kill me for the beauty I have lost. Cup. Tush foole, I gather'd it from thy clos'd eyes, Where in the shape of slumber it did rest; Be comforted, Cupids white hand shall cleere This black deformity, and thou shalt ride In Venus Charriot, and be deified; I thought to chide too bad, but 'twill not be, True Love can but a while look bitterly: Awake thou too, the treasure there inclos'd, Rifle at will, but see it well dispos'd. Exit. Clow. Where am I, nay where is she; I no sooner cast mine eye upon the boxe, to say here 'tis, but I was asleep before a man could say, what's this; what's this said I: reioyce all mortalls that weare smocks, for I have found rich beauties boxe: I was before but a man made, but I am now a very made man; and when 'tis known I am possess'd of this rich treasure, both Yong and Old, Short and Tall, Tagg and Ragg, Witch and Hagg, Crone and Bedlam, who though they come abroad but seldome 'will crawle upon crutches to find out me; But come as many as will, and as fast as can, by their favours, my Amarellis shall be first serv'd: and yet not first neither, am I in possession my selfe, and shall not I be the white boy of Arcadia: Adonis is dead, and shall not I be Venus sweetheart. The boxe is full of ugly Painting. Come boxe of beauty, and for white and red, Put down Ioves Page, the smooth-fac'd Ganimed; Dawb on, dawbe on, as thick as thou canst lay on, Till thou exceed the Ferry-man call'd PhÃ¦on; Cupid compar'd with me, shall be a toy, And look but like the signe of the black boy; My face shail shine just as my hand disposes, In one cheek I'le plant Lillies, in t'other Roses, Till all that this my visage gaze upon. Say, there, there goes the fair-fac'd Coridon. Enter Swaines. 1 Swa. Where is Coridon Hymen stayes, and Amarillis attends, the Bride is ready, but no Bride-groom to be found? Clo. I do not thinke the Clowns will know me when they see me, Colin, Dickon, Hobinall, and how is't, how is't? 2 Swa. Ha ha ha, very scurvily me-thinks, is this Coridon? Clo. Nay, if my face in Swaines breed such delight, What will the Nimphs do when they come in sight. 3 Sw. Oh monstrous Coridon! how cam'st thou thus chang'd? Clo. Chang'd, I hope so; I have not travell'd thus farre for nothing; speak you mortalls, doth not my brow relent? shines not my nose? springs not here a Lilly, there a Rose. 2 Swa. A Rose, a Lilly? a Blew-bottle, and a canker-flower, what is that upon thy face? Clow. Beauty boyes, beauty. 2 Swa. Beauty dost call it, I prethee from whence came it? Clo. Marry from hell. 2 Swa. From hell, I beleeve it, for it hath made thee look like a devill already. Clo. Go shear your sheep, make money of your wooll, Sell all your Lambes, and make your purses full, And then, if on the price we can agree, I'le fit you all and make you look like me: 2 Swa. Like thee, Ide rather see thee hang'd; dost thou thinke we mean to wear Vizors? Clo. This 'tis to be meer mortalls, and have no addition of learning or travell; their dull eyes cannot judge of CÃ¦lestiall beauty: but where's my Amarillis, and the god of marriage Hymen? 1 Swa. They both stay for thee in Venus Temple; but I hope thou wilt not be married to her in this pickle? Clo. Will I not, yes, and dazell all their eyes that shall look on me, especially my Amarillis, and she must needs have some part of my thfet, all is not gone, somthing for her is left: Lead on, lead on, this day you shall be my men, And thus in pompe will we go meet with Hymen: And Dicken if anon thou wilt be sinfull To drinke with me, I will give thee thy skinfull: If there be any here, I speak it out of duty, Desire any Complection from my boxe of beauty, This night I am busie, let him come to morrow, They shall have store, if they will buy or borrow. Exeunt. Enter PhÅbus, Pan, Vulcan, Venus, Admetus Astioche, Petrea, Menetius, and Zelotes. Ven. By this I know, that Minks is come from hell, And here she harbours; but Arcadian King, Deliver her, or by our dreadfull frowne, I'le spoyle thy Courts, and cast thy Temples downe; Conceal her longer, not the god intreats Shall guard her from the death, my rage intends. Ad. Dread Queen of Paphos, she remaines not here, Nor thinke that I abet her, though my child, Against your wrath, or power; Nay, did she sojourne In any place where I have free command, Ide cause her to be fetch't thence instantly, Aand as your slave and vassall tender her. Ven. If she be safe return'd from Proserpine, She must be pardon'd, and become divine; But to conceale her being, and keep backe The present sent, keeps but her future wrack. Apod. If ever in faire Venus I had power, Or grac'd her summer pastimes with my beames, At length with a commisserating eye, Look on distressed Psiche. Vul. Do good wife, Vse her with all the favour thou can'st thinke, Conive at her, as I at thy faults winke. Pan. And Pan protests by Cannaes nut-browne haire, The fairest Nimph, since Sirnix I ere saw, Be friends with her, my Saityrs all shall play, And I with them make this a holy-day. Enter Mercury and Proserpine Mer. To all these gods, to Venus and this traine, Health from the Son of Saturne, and Queen Ceres. Ven. Welcome, what would the messenger of Jove To us, or these? Mer. Pan, Vulcan, and your selfe, With PhÅbus, and the great Arcadian King, Must be this day at Ceres sowing-fast, Vnto which Annuall meeting, see faire Proserpine Is come from Plutoes Court. Ven. Welcome faire Queen. Apol. Welcome faire sister from the vaults below, We two are Twins, of faire Latona borne, And were together nurst in Delos Ile; You guide the night, as I direct the day, Darknesse and light betwixt us we divide, Nor square, but in our mutuall Orbes agree, Vnlesse you move just 'twixt the earth and me, For then you eclipse my lusture. Vul. Cousen Queen, I am even moon-sicke, and halfe merry mad, For joy of thy arivall. Pan. By our Crests We should be cousens, for we both are horn'd, And Vulcan of our kin too; but sweet goddesse, Now I bethinke me of th'Arcadian Nimphes, I am bound to thee for many a pretty sight, And much good sport I have had by thy moon-light. Pros. To give you meeting, I am come from hell. Ven. Saw you not Psiche there? Pros. Loves Queen I did, Hither she comes with Cupid, hand in hand, Her leprousie, through labour, is made cleare, And beauteous in your eye, she'll now appeare, Enter Cupid and Psiche Cup. CÃ¦lestiall Sea-borne Queen, I here present you My Psiche, who hath satisfi'd your will: Deliver her, faire Love, from Proserpine, The boxe of beauty, endlesse, and devine. Psi. Guided by Love, Lord of my life and hope, I come undaunted to your gracious sight, Hoping my sufferance hath out-worne his wrath? Ven. She hath scap'd hell, and now the taske is done, And I still crost by a disobedient Son; But tell me how this Leoper came thus faire? Cup. At my entreat it was, 'Mongst all the gods I claym'd her for my Wife, Who taking a joynt pity of her wrongs: Gave their consent, and then great Iove himselfe Call'd for a cup of Immortality, Dranke part to her, and Psiche quaff't the rest, At which, deformity forsook her quite, And she made faire, and then proclaim'd my bride, Iove vowing, she should now be deifi'ed. Ven. I see I cannot conquer Destiny, By Fate she first was thine, I give her thee. Mer. Now Psiche, you must see your sisters judg'd, Vnstaid Petrea, and unkind Astioche, Admetus, you must be their sentencer. Asti. Husband, your knees. Petr. My dear lord plead for us. Asti. Will neither; yet Father. Ad. Wretches peace. Psiche by you was torne from her delight, And rudely rent from Cupids Paradice; 'Twas you that robb'd her of a fathers love; By your alurements she was sent to hell, And had not divine aid secur'd her thence, Poor soule for ever sh'had bin there detain'd, For which, to endlesse durance I adjure you; For merits silver gates are alwayes barr'd To hearts impenitent and wilfull hard. Psi. Have pity on them Father, gentle husband, Remember not their fraw'd in tempting me: You gods and goddesses with Psiche ioyne, To beg their pardons, all you Arcadians kneele; For had they not my happinesse envy'd, My Love and patience had not so bin try'd. All. We all will mediate for them. Ad. Then Daughters, give your sister Psiche thanks, And to her vertues be a servant still, Which makes atonement for your ill. Both. We'll henceforth be her hand-maids. Ven. They shall attend her unto plenties bower, Where Ceres, Queen of Fertility, Invites us with the other gods to feast. Mer. There Iove and PhÅbus shall lead Cupids Queen, To the bright pallace of Eternity; Bacchus shall give us Wine, and Ganimed Shall crowne our full cups with the grapes pure blood; Ceres shall yeeld us all earths delicates, The Graces shall bring Balme, the Muses sing In Cupids honour, Loves Immortall King. Vul. Vulcan will dance, and sing, and skip, and quaffe, And with his smoaky jests make Cupid laugh. Cup. Such as love me, make me their president, See, thus I take faire Psiche by the hand, Mercury do you the like to Proserpine, My Mother Venus cannot want a mate; In honour of our marriage, match your selves, And with a measure grace our nuptialls, But such as do not love to be in motion, View as spectators, how our joy appeares, Dancing to the sweet musick of the spheares. A Dance of Cupid, Psiche, the gods and goddesses. Apol. Now circle Psiche in a fayry ring, Whilst I and Venus grace her with this Crowne; This done, to feast with Ceres, and the gods, And next unto the pallace of the Sun, To end those sacred rites we have begun. Enter Midas and Apuleius. Mi. Is this your morrall? This your Poetry? What hast thou done, what spoke, what presented, Which I with all these cannot justly taxe? Ap. Yes, all like thee th'obtuse and stupid mindes, But there's an understanding that hath depth Beyond thy shallow non-sence; there's a wit, A braine which thou want'st, I to that submit. Mi. And even in that thou fool'st thy selfe. Cup. Nay then, I by the favour of these Gentlemen, Will arbitrate this strife; one seeks to advance His Art, the other stands for ignorance; Both hope, and both shall have their merits full, Here's meed for either, both the apt, and dull, Pleas'd or displeas'd, this censure I allow; Keep thou the Asses cares, the Lawrell thou: If you, judicious, this my doom commend, Psiche by you shall doubly Crown'd ascend; And then this Legacy I leave behind, Where ere you love, prove of one faith, one mind. The Spring comes on, and Cupid doth devine, Each shall enjoy his best lov'd Valentine, Which when you have, may you like us agree, And at your best retirements thinke on me. FINIS.</field>
