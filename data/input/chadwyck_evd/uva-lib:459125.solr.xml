      <field name="fulltext">LOVE CROWNES THE END. A PASTORALL</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PRESENTED BY THE SCHOLLEES OF Bingham in the County of Notingham, in the yeare 1632.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HORAT. QuÃ²d si me Lyricis vatibus inseris, Sublimi feriam sidera vertice.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To The HONORABLE AND THE MOST WORTHY MECÃNAS, SIR John Winter Knight, Secretary of State, and Master of Requests to the Queenes most excellent Majestie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the honor'd Patron of his Book. SIR, As my service binds me and my love, (May your faire selfe so of the same approve) As your deservings, I have plac'd you here Equall with PhÅbus in his Hemisphere, Where your refulgent brightnesse cast's a light Into these twinkling Lamps, and give's them sight. Minerva bad me tell you she is proud Of those deserts which in your brest doe crowd As in a throng, which our capacity Not able to finde out, leave's to her eye. Thrice worthy Hero, may your Halcion dayes Be ne're extinct till crazie Time decayes. Jo. Tatham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fancie, to the Reader. Readers of all sorts, when you have survai'd Each roome within this Theater, and paid Sufficient for admittance, you'l allow To render me account of all, and how You like the fabrick, if it be well rear'd; The thought of falling is not to be fear'd, Though he that did erect it, has not serv'd Seaven yeares to the Profession, nor deserv'd The Attribute of Architect, yet hee Expects by your faire hands to be made free; Hee'l then set up in th' Citie, and in spight Of Suburb power, or Corporation's might: Use his best skill to please you. Faith, be just, Doe not enseale his Freedome with the aust, Hee's prest t' obey you howsoe're, and will Without a grumble, serve you, and fulfill Forsooth, your precepts being prest so lowe, I hope you'l raise him, Char'ty teacheth so: Yet, hee'l not begge your favours, to assist Him, by Certificate, doe what you lift; He knowes the worst on't, if you doe refuse, 'Tis but the having (to the Hall) his Muse To have the gentle notch; and so to try If hee in time can gaine the Mystery; Hee sweares he will defie you, when that hee Atchives to th'Warden of the Company.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend the Author on his Fancies Theater. Fancie, in all his Colours ne're appear'd So variously delightfull, as in this Magnificent Theater, which thou hast rear'd Out of thy Genuine braine, and call'st it His. Here does he take all shapes, and act all parts; The noble Hero, and the humble Swaine; The jocund Lovers, and lamenting hearts. As well the Buskind, as the Comick straine. Fancie has something here for every one, From Reveller to Mourner; still provided, Each brings a proper apprehension; And one not by anothers humor guided. But let all come and welcome: The severe Cato himselfe may have free entrance here. R. Broome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend the Author, on his ingenious Theater of Fancies. A Theater is built, and every part Order'd with various Workmanship and Art, The Sceanes with Protean transformation move, Presenting Buskins, Socks, and Themes of love: A Mourners teares, and joy of a faire Bride; Smart Satyre, and a world of change beside. 'Tis not the Building only Men should see, But what's prepar'd for Action in't by thee. Upon the outward forme let no Man looke, But search the richer inside of thy Booke. And if their humors doe not judgement blinde, They'l most things pleasing, none offending finde. Sic censet Amicus. Tho. Nabbes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his loving friend the Author, on his Fancies Theater. 'Tis worth enough to have so many friends, Who doe applaud with judgement thy faire ends; Which raise thy Towring Fancies to such height, That ev'ry line affords us a conceit Farre different from the Whimzies of the time, Where 'tis their chiefest praise to trot in Rime, And thunder out their meaning in a Phrase, Wo'd strike a Martiall spirit in a maze: But let the world judge if what thou hast done, Deserve not good mens approbation? For my part, I shall deeme thee worthy praise, When such a troope as these extoll thy Bayes. When Fancie in thy Theater doth play, And wins more credit than a second day; When thy pure Helicon so high doth flow, It out-braves Iordan or the swelling Poe. Let not thy Fancie ebbe, but more and more In large it's limits, and encroach the Shoare. And let the Sea-borne Goddesse ever be Propitious to thy straines of Poesie. And may'st thou in thy Verse so happy prove, That Cupid may affect thy beauteous Love Dearer than Psyche, till thou make her be Fairer than thine, lest he shou'd Rivall thee. Thy Friend C. G.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his Friend the Author, on his Fancies Theater. Friend, since the choise and most Emphatick phrase Appeares too slender to enrich thy prayse; How shall the discord of my jarring skill Ought but detract from th'honor of thy Quill? But yet, so just an int'rest in my love Thy merits clayme, that should I not approve The rich Exchequer of thy pregnant Braine To it's true worth, I should appeare a staine. Come all you Youths fill'd with PhÅbean fire, (As tribute to the Musick of his Lyre) Bring each with willing Palmes a Daphnean Bough, And make a Chaplet to impale his Brow, Into whose Brest Apollo's selfe hath ray'd Such loftie Raptures, as may well perswade The transmigration which Pythagoras Maintain'd for truth, may for authentick passe. For, when th'inticing pleasure of thy Line, And teeming Fancies unexhausted Myne I view, me thinks the Genius of those Three Admired Laureats are ensphear'd in Thee, Smooth Shakespeare, neat Randolph, and wittie Ben, Flow in a mutuall sweetnesse from Thy Pen: Nature in Thee seemeth Arts parallell, For Thou art both her Pride and Miracle. May th'Virgin Candor of thy infant Bayes, Unravisht, spring, spight of our Critick dayes; And from Thee such Nectarean Dew distill, As may the world with admiration fill. Geo. Lynn.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his good friend M. Iohn Tatham upon his Fancies Theater. To see what upstart Scriblers strive in Rime, To be the Paper-blurrers of the time, Makes me amaz'd; yet if they wo'd but see The flowry Raptures that are done by thee, They wo'd no question blush to see the Bulls, And rabling Ballads of their windy sculls. Here they may see compos'd a spicy-nest Of flaming Fancies, all in spangles drest: For here each line that to the eye appeares, May sing a Lullaby unto the Spheres. Poore Fancies marre a Theater, but see The Fancies Theater is made by thee. Robert Chamberlaine.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend M. Iohn Tatham on his Fancies Theater. To shew my selfe in Print I ne're had thought, But that thy Fancies has my thoughts out-wrought. What shall I say? 'tis this I doe admire, And think thy wits like to th'aspiring fire, Will ne're descend; thy braine from vulgar straines Is clarifi'd so neatly, it containes Th'Epitome of smooth and well scan'd verse, And though in future times thy aged herse, Shall be enthron'd with Lawrell; yet this age May blame my zealous friendship, and in rage Both carp at thee, and me: But it shall ne're Make me strike sayle, but rather make my steere Beare stiffe with malice for to think that men Would make abortive this thy Infant Pen. But yet my hopes are confident, that they Cannot but give thy worth a branch of Bay, Though not a Lawrell, which slow-paced Time Shall bring, and humbly offer at thy Shrine. H. Davison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend Iohn Tatham Gent. upon his Fancies Theater. Thou didst not meane thy Theater sho'd be Common (though publique) to th'Obliquity Of ev'ry duller eye: 'Tis rais'd too neere, (Propt by thy Fancies Atlas) to the sphere Of purest wit, which the dull sonnes of Earth (Sho'd they afflict the Universe with dearth Of Ignorance and Envie, pile it up In envious heapes for their ascent to crop Thy Bayes) can ne're aspire to: Attempt they may, And passe our duller ayre; But the cleare Ray Of thy bright worth appearing, will deprive Their terrified soule of sence; deceive Their hopes through their own ruine. And what they have Now for their steps, anon shall be their grave, Prest by the weight of Ignorance: But then Their guilty blushing shame shall rise agen To scornfull memory, whose black name shall give More Iustre to thy praises, to survive 'Till Time hath lost himselfe: And this great All Be brought to its confused Funerall. Passe not a Zoylists envie, since th'ast knowne Thy censure through their breath, whose pleasure none Can without sacriledge dispute. But if Thy fearefull soule cannot retaine beliefe Of safety, Iove shall to secure thy feare, Displace his Bird from's bosome-nest, and there Harbour thy Muse: But what injustice can Refuse the God's, and take the word of Man, Th'ast had a Jury of Immortalls, that Have given their censure: finde not guilty; what Bold Heav'n-contemners then dare contradict, When the Divine Vote's publish their Edict? The Daphnean Bay graspt by the Frosts cold hand, Doth grow more freshly greene; thy Muse shall stand As firme 'gainst Envies storme, till Fame shall be Proud to record thy still greene memory. James Jones.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Vpon his Dreame and Censure of the Gods. And canst thou dreame so well? then never wake, Unlesse it be that so thou may'st pertake The reall substance of thy thoughts, and then Thou'lt make a subject for the rarest Pen To treat on: But having at a venture Invok'd th'Immortals for to have their censure Upon thy Fate; Sol sooner shall stand still, And fire the Orbs, but thou shalt hate thy will. H. Davison.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend M. Io. Tatham on his Fancies Theater. When I beheld and view'd each sev'rall line Appearing a full fraughted Magazine Of choyce conceits; such as our Fancies now (Diff'ring from what they were) must needs allow: How sweet and how delici'ous to the taste: How pleasing to the eye, how trim'd, how chaste; And where thy Fancy hits upon a crime, Thy Verse doth mask it, suting with the Time; How eloquent thou art, how thine owne phrase Becomes an Orator, and tells thy praise; The faults I found were few, the greatest was (And yet for some knowne reasons it may passe) Where thou do'st court thy Mistris, and doth wipe Each word with gold, enough for to invite All eyes, all hearts; our greatest feare was, wee Should suffer by th'inchanting Orat'ry. I know thy Muse is chaste, and will not strive, T'attract all Beauties to her pleasing hive. My wishes bid goe on, and may thy Rime Flourish beyond the utmost date of Time. William Barnes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">On the Author of the Fancies Theater. Amongst the rest, Friend Tatham, I am come, To doe thy Fancies right, and quit the summe I stand engag'd for: since my forward youth Sign'd Love a Bond, for currant Coyne of Truth, To pay at severall times, the world shall be Thy Secretarie; and take this truth from me, In all thy Shop of Fancies, not a Line (I emulate thee so) but I wish mine; 'Twill be sufficient portion for thy Name To live by; for Times Treasurer, wing'd Fame, Shall, as thy worth deserves, speake thee as high As any fill'd her Trump with Poesie. Tho. Rawlins.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend M. Iohn Tatham, upon his Fancies Theater. My Muse composed more of love than fire, Would spare her Pen, and silently admire Thy worth, which her expressions cannot rayse, Unlesse she borrow thine owne stile and phrase, And from thy proper heapes purloyne a store, Which payes one debt to make a thousand more; Did not thy friendship and thy sacred merit Conjure up flames even in a frozen spirit. Though last in number, thinke me not the least, I thought as much as all thy Friends exprest; But our sincere desires suffer much wrong, Since the sad diff'rence 'twixt the heart and tongue; My thoughts soare high, though my expression's weake, True friends think out their tale, when others speake. Yet write I this not for peculiar ends, To cast aspersion on your other friends; I in that Consort jointly doe preferre My off'ring to thy Fancies Theater. An. Newport.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend the Author, on his Fancies Theater. Deare friend, my infant Muse will bee Obscur'd, when as the Readers see Thy am'rous straines, and thou'lt be found To be with greater glory crown'd By my weake Lines, which to thy prayse Affords a Coronet of Bayes. In this I am thy friend, to bee Thy foile, that plainely men may see Thy greater lustre, and may spend Their Censures gently on thy friend. R. Pynder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To his friend the Author. Had I Chapmans Line or Learning, Iohnsons Art, Fletchers more accurate Fancie, or that part Of Beaumont that's divine, Dun's profound skill, Making good Verses live, and damning ill: I then would prayse thy Verses, which sho'd last Whil'st Time ha's sands to run, or Fame a blast. But I've a Braine so dull, that though I beat The Anvill ne're so oft, there's nought but sweat And emptie vapours crowne my long lost paine. I write, 'tis bad, dislik't, rub't out againe; And in this serious folly I abuse The patience of my Lamp, my Oyle I loose; Nor is it fit, that each unworthy Line Sho'd court the light, but onely such as thine.

You starres of Honour, brighter than the day, Or new rais'd PhÅbus in his morning Ray; As rich in Wisedome as in Vertues rare; Accept the choicest dish our wits prepare, As a third course to please your eye, which still Covets to have of novelties its fill. We have not bundled up some Kick shawes here To bid you welcome; Wee doe hate such geere. Our braine's the Kitchin, and our wit's the meat, Preparitive to which, wee bid you eat, If lik't, if not refrain't; you Judges sit To damne or save our not yet ripen'd wit: So rest upon your goodnesse; if you frowne, Our poore endeavours then are troden downe.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Grove discover'd, and in an obscure corner thereof Cliton as being asleepe. To him Alexis. ALEXIS. How still the morning is, as if it meant To steale upon us without Times consent. And pry into our errors. I have beene Searching in every Thicket, Wood, and Greene To finde my Lamb, and many dolefull cryes Enter'd my eares e're day. What's this that lyes In such an obscure place, where none scarce tread, Unlesse the Ghosts of the disturbed dead? Blesse me great Pan, I see it's Clitons face With a sword drawne; how happy was my chace This way! I hope his folly has not made Himselfe a Beast, as butcher'd with this Blade; 'T may be he sleepes: I'le speake to him, and try; Yet I halfe doubt him 'cause he here doth lye. Cliton, awake, the Night's dislodg'd, and now Bright Morne is trimming of her Virgin brow, To court the Sunne, when from the Westerne deepe And Thetis lap his glimmering beames doe peepe T' ascend his glorious Carre. Clitonâawake, And with thy sleepe all dreames of horror shake That may affright thee. CLITON. Kinde Alexis, thanks, How found you me? ALEXIS. Walking those flowry banks, 'Twixt the greene valley, and the place which wee Have consecrated to Loves Deity: Seeking a stray'd Lamb, I did heare sad moanes Proceed from some like peales of parting groanes, Which I pursu'd, but in my search I found None but your selfe: you resting on this ground I wonder'd much to see you! CLITON. So you might. But when y'ave heard the cause on't, 'twill affright Your easie brest. Doe you observe this Hand, This fatall Hand, at my unjust command Did:âOh, I could destroy't! ALEXIS. For what offence? CLITON. This hand has spilt the blood of Innocence, My Florida's. ALEXIS. How? CLITON. And when I'd done (As I might well) did hide me from the Sunne, Fearing his eye would be the onely cause To finde me out; and here from men and lawes I have obscur'd my selfe, and could not say 'Twas justly night, when night: Nor day when day; My fact had sulled both. ALEXIS. What urg'd thee to such inhumanity? CLITON. Onely suspition of her loyalty, Dreaming Lysander had enjoy'd her love, My jealousie to cruelty did move: I slew her three dayes since, and since have bin Each night at that place I stain'd with my sin, To seeke the body, but some sacred Power, For none else durst approach her purity, Has certainly made her immortall, and Convey'd the body to some holier land. ALEXIS. Is the body gone then? CLITON. Or else my eyes doe faile me as an abject not worth their help. ALEXIS. Thy crime requires contrition; to that end, Thou shalt with me. Thy dayes to come shalt spend In holy uses; I'le prepare for thee, In the best forme I can, each property Belonging to a pensive man. You must Forget all youthfull pleasures, think on dust, And penitence the onely meanes to bring Thy soule to rest after this wandering. Will you with me? CLITON. To death, or otherwise, since Florida is dead Exeunt. Cloe pursu'd by a lustfull sheepheard. Lustfull Sheepheard. Stay my darling, doe not flye, This place is private, here's none nigh. Feare not Wench, I'le doe no harme, But embrace thee in my arme; Cull and kisse, and doe the thing Shepheards doe at wrasteling, CLOE. Oh help, if any Shepheards, neere, Heare my laments. Lust. Shepheard. Yet creature, doe not feare: But if you with coy disdaine, Doe think to leave me in my flame, I'le force those golden locks of thine To lye beneath these feet of mine; Then yeeld and here enjoy such sweet As with our embraces meet. CLOE. Oh haplesse Maid, no ayde will come. Lysander steps forth. LYSANDER. Feare not Virgin; here is some Natures monster; Villaine, why Does thy flame now burne so high? Will no other serve thy turne To quench the heats that in thee burne, But so faire a soule as shee? Villaine hence, or else I'le bee Thy Butcher. Lustfull shep. gazeth on him, then runnes in. CLOE. Kinde Youth, to whom am I Bound for this faire courtesie? LYSANDER. First unto Heaven faire Creature; next to me A poore unworthy Shepheard. CLOE. May your Sweetest whom you love, Ever constant to you prove. Be shee brighter than the Sunne, Pleasing as our day at noone; Fresher than the morning dew: Sweeter than a new kill'd Ewe; Like Aurora deckt with flowers, Or the welcome Aprill showers. May shee love you, and you be The mirrour for true Constancie; Goe gentle Youth, and this day prosperous be Amongst our Swaines in your Activity. Exit. LYSANDER. A thousand thanks reward you Pan be my guide, and thou faire Glorians, Whose beauty has encinder'd my poore heart Almost to nothing this day; thou shalt finde Thou hast a power above our humane kinde. Exit. DAPHNES. Bright sunne, why do'st thou shine on me? Is it to mock me? keepe thy light; for I Had rather live in darknesse, and so dye. Or do'st thou shew thy lustre in disdaine, Because I have so oft with speech prophane Blasphem'd against thy goodnesse, And in praise Of a poore earthly creature spent my dayes? Do'st thou yet smile? forgive me, and I'le bee No more her servant, but will honour thee. Keepe thou thy brightnesse PhÅbus, and this day From all our Swaines I'le bring the prize away. Exit. Leon. Gloriana, and Francisco. FRANCISCO. Fairest, this day, be pleas'd to smile on me, And let those hidden favours yet unshewne, Flow in abundance, that Swaines may see None e're can conquer me, but you alone. GLORIANA. My favours friend is past, and you have tasted So much of my poore bounty, that it's wasted. LEON. We stay too long sonne, pray make haste, Let us not spend time in waste. Daughter, you shall goe with mee, Where their pastime wee may see. A noyse within. Heark, I heare 'em make a noyse; Oh my hearts my bonny boyes, Play your parts; when I was young I was full as stout and strong. FRAN. Dearest, I must part; this calls me hence. Father, I leave you. Exit Fra: GLORIANA. For ever I hope, would I could prophesie, And be effectuall; it should be so. LEON. Daughter, this way let us high; I am old, I'le not come nigh: Nor shalt thou my dapper Girle, Lest those staves that often whirle Hit thy face. What againe! Aowt againe. Nay then I feare wee goe in vaine. GLORIANA. Yet Father let us goe, that we May know who gain'd the victory. Exeunt. The lustfull sheepheard like a Satyre. Because Dame Nature, pox of all her tricks, Has not dealt so well with me as shee ought, Making me but a lump of rough-hew'n stuffe, The pettish Wenches will not play with me, Nor tick nor toy, and cause I'm apt for sport: How e're I'm form'd, I've put on this disguise, To fright the baggages, when getting some 'Twixt these my armes, J'le force 'em to my will, Yet passe unknowne. Thus I my sences fill. Scrub within. So ho, so ho, so ho. What noyse is yon? SCRVB. Through the Woods, and through the Woods have I run after the Run-away my Master.âWhat art thou in the devils name? Lust. shepheard. Sirrah, I amâ SCRVB. A devil, I knew't before: Thou should'st be a leacherous devill by thy hayrie hide: but I am no Succubus goodman devill. Lust. shepheard Do'st thou feare me? SCRVB. Oh Lord, me Sir. I have met such another devill as thou art, in my Porridge dish. Lust. shepheard. And didst thou know him? SCRVB. Know him? how doe you meane know him? I should be loth to know him or thee, or hee thee, or thy grand-Master me for any ill; for I have defi'd the devill and his works ever since the generall Earthquake, and that my Mothers Cat miscarried in the horse Pond. Lust. shepheard. Was thy Mother a Witch? SCRVB. How a Witch you devillâI'le witch you. Offers to strike. Lust. shepheard. Hold man; shee was an honest woman. SCRVB. Nay, now thou ly'st, and thou be'st the devils devill: For I have heard her soberly say, shee had sixâ Bastards by a Sowgelder before shee pigg'd me. Offers again. Lust. shepheard. Hold, hold man. SCRVB. The devill afraid of blowes! I'le make you spet fire. Runnes after him. A great showt. Lysander with a Garland on's head, and scarfes on's armes, Cloe following him. CLOE. Friendly Swaine, the day is yours; you see My prayer it seemes successfull was to thee. Pitty my mayden teares; till now, I ne're Su'd to a shepheard, but the shepheards were My suiters. Nor deeme me light, because my love is such; I love indeed, and feare I love too much. You sav'd my life, my chastity, what more? Take me as one that was your owne before. LYSANDER. How much I grieve faire Shepheardesse, my Fate Will not allow me such a just proportion, To render thee, as thy deserts have merited From me. CLOE. Oh friend! I'le be your servant, and your flocks will keepe. I'le nightly watch while you doe sweetly sleepe, And in the morne I'le willingly to field, While you doe taste the sweets Loves valleyes yeeld, And with industrious labour against noone, Will get your dinner ready, so you will But smile on me, and say well done. LYSANDER. To starve your hopes from furder prosecution in this suit. Know I've already fixt my resolution To love none but faire Gloriana, shee Is the Commandresse of my life, and fortunes: So much I pitty you, that I could wish I had two hearts, that you might share in one As a just recompence for your love, but why do I Entertaine such frivolous unnecessary talk. May you live happy, and enjoy as rare, And constant Shepheard as your selfe is faire. Exit. CLOE. Is my face wither'd? or has Nature so Deform'd me lately that I am not Cloe? For thee poore Cloe Shepheards have pitcht the Barre, Wrastl'd, and leap'd, and showne the feats of Warre. For thee each strove to gaine thee as his Dove; But thou did'st sleight and scorne their simple love. How many Verses have the Shepheards made, In praising of thy Beauty, whil'st thou laid Thy heart on him that hates to heare thee nam'd, And thy delight is still to have him fam'd? How many Rings and Gloves hast thou receiv'd From the poore Swaines thou often times deceiv'd? For thee on Holy dayes they often would Meet on the Heath next to the Pinders fold, Where they with Musick, and such sweet content, Would spend their time to make thee merriment. Since then my love is not one mite rewarded, And that my Beauty is no more regarded: I'le teare these golden locks, that shepheards may Leave off their sport, and make no Holy-day. SINGS. I will follow through yon Grove, Where I soone shall meet my Love; Then with sweet embraces wee Will clip, and cull, and none shall see. A willow Garland I will make, And sweetly weare it for his sake. Then through Thickets, Woods, and Plaines, I will hide me from the Swaines? Hy da, hy da, what art thou? As she is running in, meetes her. DAPHNES. You were not wont to question that; how fares my dearest Love? CLOE. Hence thou coward, hence from me: Blush at thy disloyalty. Did'st not tell me thou would'st gaine Me reputation by thy fame; And suffer'st now a stranger beare The prize, and thou to have no share? DAPHNE. Your frownes my Fairest, and not hee, Gain'd from me the victory. Had you smil'd as you did frowne, All his strength I'd mauger'd downe. What has disturb'd my Love? who has committed This injurie to thy person? CLOE. Ha, ha, ha; foole, foole! see you now foole? Foole! kisseâkisseâkisseâ Exit. DAPHNES. What fickle things are women? yet they are such men cannot be without; our too much doting on 'em makes 'em proud; for loving them, they'd make us hate our selves. I doe suspect this bad distemper in her proceeds from some deniall Lysander has given her to her unlawfull suit, knowing my love to her. 'Tis so. I must not let her suffer in too high a nature. Exit. A place discover'd all greene mirtles, adorn'd with Roses, a Title written over't thus. LOVERS VALLEY. Lysander and Gloriana. LYSANDER. Dearest Love, faire as the Easterne morne, When with her Summers roabe shee decks the Plaines, And hangs on every bush a liquid pearle, In Mayes triumphing moneth, sweet as the ayre, The PhÅnix does expire in, sit while I play The cunning Thiefe, and steale thy heart away, And thou shalt stand as Judge to censure me, To recompence thy losse I must agree; To give my heart, which being understood, 'Tis but exchange, I keepe your heart, you mine. GLORIANA. Content my Love thus, shee would court thee, And thus and thus shee'd play a Wantons part: Doe I not blush Adonis. Kisse him. LYSANDER. Oh, you must not blush! you spoile the jest on't, I'le span thy Waste, and doe as Wantons use; I'le be Adonis, but will not refuse. GLORIANA. Nay fie, you stray beyond your limits. LYSANDER. Kisse. Modesty allowes such undefiled mixtures. To them FRANCISCO. Ah! where are my eyes? what curst unruly windes Have blowne 'em out, and in their stead plac'd these base counterfaits! Oh you Deities? you are unjust to suffer this? If these eyes be my owne may they be blasted, that without my Lycence. Durst see this object: but yet let reason Sway my passion. Why doe I wish a mischiefe on my selfe That must see their destruction? I have long Suspected him by reason of her Necios, And the continuall scorne dwelt on her brow When I did proffer love, were I provided I'd rush upon 'em, and from his base armes Snatch the false Girle, but I'le stand secure A while and over-heare 'em. GLORIANA. 'Tis time to part, w'ave dally'd Time too long. Lysander, will you walk? LYSANDER. Thinks Gloriana That Time is lost that's spent with her Lysander FRANCISCO. Deluding devill GLORIANA. I could Lysander. (Might it not staine my Mayden-yeares) live onely By gazing on thy Beauty. LYSANDER. Nay, now you mock me; but I hope e're long Wee shall with more security enjoy What our hearts wish for. Where shall wee next meet? GLORIANA. In this very place to morrow be sure you meet. Exeunt. LYSANDER. I will not faile. FRANCISCO. Nor I to meet you both. Oh my best starres! How I shall weave my selfe into revenge just, just Gods y'ave stampt my braine for mischiefe, which on them I'le execute. And none shall pry into my faults within. Revenge has Coverts, fit to hide his sin. Exit. CLOE mad. SINGS. Hey downe a downe derry, And shall not wee be merry? A fire on thy hole, 'Tis as black as a cole, And thy nose is as browne as a berry. Hi ho. What a thing this love is? Shee sings. When Love did act a womans part, Shee could have dy'd with all her heart, It swell'd her so in every part; Shee swore 'twas winde, and then didâ Hi, hi, hi, hi, Nymphes to her Sing about her. Love cannot chuse but pitty yeeld, He never liv'd in tented field, Mongst iron hearted men, He knowes both how, and when Thee to restore To what thou wert before. He has a tender brest, which knowes Your wants by the tormenting woes He's subject to himselfe. Then doe not you despaire, That are both young and faire. Thus wee convay you hence. CLOE. Where doe you leade mee? Takes Cloe with 'em. Exeunt. Lysander and Gloriana. LYSANDER. How blest are wee, that Fortune hath So much befriended us in this happy? Convenient opportunity? GLORIANA. 'Tis an unaccustom'd favour, And we ought in duty to acknowledge A thankfulnesse for it. Shee sits downe. LYSANDER. So sits the pride of Nature to out-vye Each glorious Beauty of the chequer'd field, And Flora's richest Wardrobe. GLORIANA. I perceive Y'ave practis'd long in th'flattering Rules of love. What wil reward you? LYSANDER. A kisse is more than I can merit. Will you sing. GLORIANA. And you'l give me another for my paines. LYSANDER. Put it to the tryall: You shall not loose your labour. SONG. GLORIANA. Sit while I doe gather flowers, And depopulate the Bowers. Here's a kisse will come to thee; Lysander. Give me one, I'le give thee three. BOTH. Thus in harmlesse sport wee may, Passe all idle houres away. GLORIANA. Hark, hark how fine The Birds doe chime, And pretty Philomel Her moane doth tell. BOTH. Then pitty, pitty love, and all is well. GLORIANA. Here's the Violet, Pink, and Rose, The sweetest breathings for the nose. LYSANDER. Yet thy breath to me doth yeeld More fragrant sents than all the field. GLORIANA. Love cares not for flowers or toyes, Play games for your apish Boyes. Nor superstition For his condition Is for to know Lysanderâif you love or no? GLORIANA. Then answer, love I or no. But yet me thinks that face should be The Modell of true constancie: Therefore no reason have I, To suspect thy loyalty, Here's another kisse for thee. LYSANDER. Give me one, I'le give thee three. BOTH. Thus in harmlesse sport wee may, Passe all idle houres away. GLORIANA. Hark, hark how fine The Birds doe chime, And pretty Philomel, Her moane doth tell. BOTH. Then pitty, pitty Love, and all is well. LYSANDER. Y'ave sung me most a sleepe, my eyes are dull and heavy, Faith I must make thy lap my pillow. GLORIANA. Repose thy gentle head on't. Alas! I'm heavy too, and must obey my destinie. Sleepe. The Destinies. SING. Sleepe on, sleepe on, For wee have so decreed, That thou must bleed: Sleepe on, sleepe on, And maist thou never rise, For blood the shepheard cryes. Sleepe on, sleepe on. Exeunt. A heavenly messenger in white. SONG. Rise, rise Lysander to prevent What the Destinies decreed. Thou art constant, permanent, And must not bleed: Thy constant seed Shall be the shepheards joy, No annoy Shall attend Such a friend As the Lasses need. Rise, rise, awake! And sleepe off shake; The Heavens are pleas'd thy part to take, For thy Love's sake. Exit. They stirre. GLORIANA. Lysander, where ar't? Lord how my fancie's troubled! LYSANDER. How fares my Gloriana? I have had Strange thoughts that would have dispossest Me of my rest, had I not tooke it here On your sacred lap. Francisco disguis'd with others. FRANCISCO. That is the man: upon him instantly While I attach his Mistresse. GLORIANA. Ah me Lysander, what meanes these sad spectacles 1. VILLANE. Wee must have life and death. GLORIANA. Both life and death: how can that be? FRAN. Thy life, and thy Lysanders death. GLORIANA. I've heard that voyce e're now Afford more milder language. FRAN. Stop her mouth lest shee does charme me Unto pitty. LYSANDER. Are you but men, and dare doe this? GLORIANA. Oh spare Lysander, sheath your swords in me. FRAN. Wee'l not expostulate: take that. 2. VILLANE. And that. They take her with them. GLORIANA. Oh Lysander! Stay, stay, let me but breath my last Upon her lips, and I'le forgive this Butchery. Cowards, Villaines, Miscreants, have you left me? But oh my fairest, whether art thou fled? Feare has made pale those cheekes that were so red. I'le follow thee: they shall not dare to touch The least hem of thy garments. But oh, I faint; And must surrender up to earth that part I tooke from her. Gloriana, oh Gloriana! Claudia and Florida. CLAVDIA. Wee may for recreation walk, And use some pretty harmlesse talk. Religion does not tye us to A stricter course than wee can doe. FLORIDA. Tis dangerous walking, every field Doth nought but sounds of horror yeeld, And to my fancie doth appeare Poore slaughter'd Maids; the Butchers beare The name of Lovers, and can finde A way in killing to be kinde. Lysander Oh! [FLORIDA.] Ah me, whence came that groane? CLAUDIA. It is a Shepheard wounded sore. FLORIDA. Sure I've seene this face before! Oh 'tis Lysander th' truest Swaine, That ever breath'd on Grove or Plaine. CLAUDIA. What, is hee mark'd for present death? FLORIDA. No, there is hopes of life: his breath I feele come coldly. Take him with 'em. CLAUDIA. Help him in. Pan be just, reward this sin. SCRUB. The devill and his dam I think have carri'd away my Master; I cannot finde him in never a Wenches placuit, (pocket I should say) and yet I have beene in a simple many since I came among these Mutton-Mongers, these sheepe-eaters, unlesse they have hid him amongst their wooll, I cannot imagine where hee should be I will weare my shooes to peeces but I'le finde him. Exit. Lysander, Claudia, Florida, and Cloe. LYSANDER. Religious Matron, from your divine hand I have receiv'd my life next to heavens providence: Sure my wounds were not desperate, or else Some Angell did afford a soveraigne Balsome To cure 'em in such an instant: but howsoever, I must ascribe it to your pious care: For which I owe you more than I can pay, Unlesse it be my life. CLAUDIA. The Surgery I use is sent from Heaven, And you owe them your life, not me. LYSANDER. But Florida, Did you ne're heare of your Cliton since? FLORIDA. Never. Yet I would gladly see him, did I know By what meanes to atchieve it? CLOE. Deare friend, the stories of us both if weigh'd In an equall ballance, would poize each other Yet to put her love to the Test, I'le undertake your message. LYSANDER. Thou wilt endeare me to thee then, about it. Exit Cloe. FLORIDA. You heard how Cloe came to our happy Cure. LYSANDER. Never. FLORIDA. The Wood Nymphes brought her to our Cell, finding Her stray'd where ever since sh'as bin. LYSANDER. If you will with mee, I'le promise you, you shall see your Cliton: FLORIDA. On those conditions I will. CLAVDIA. Whether now? FLORIDA. No farther than with your consent, and if you please, you may goe with us. Clau. I am contented. Exeunt. Gloriana distracted. SINGS. I know Lysander's dead, Then farewell maydenhead; Thou art but one: When I am gone: It never shall be saidâhy ho, ho. Oh Lysander. CLITON like a Hermit. Save you faire Maid, I wish you joy, Free from ought that may annoy Your quiet, or disturb your sence; Send you health and penitence. GLORIANA. Ha, ha, ha, what, are you Lysander? what, with that beard there's a great beard indeed: heark you Fryer Tuck, doe you see yon handsome shepheard Lysander? Why did you say he was dead? CLITON. You are mistaken, I'm a Hermit that can cure All wounds, but what sinne makes impure; And those are cur'd by one above: I can help those ills that move Man to distraction, jealous feares, In man or woman. I have yeares Has gain'd experience to apply For all sorts a safe remedy. GLORIANA. SINGS. Doe you see where he doth stand, With a Crosse-Bow in his hand. I will follow thee my Deare, Though the Goblins keepeth there. Offers to goe in. CLITON. Stay pure Mayd. GLORIANA. Why doe you hold me old man? insooth you shall not. CLITON. If you will be rul'd by mee, You shall your Lysander see. GLORIANA. Shall I indeed now? CLITON. Come with me and you shall know More, if you will but patient grow. Exeunt. Leonand Alexis. Good Father, be patient. LEON. Is not my daughter lost, my onely daughter, The onely staffe whereon my age did rest, And onely comfort which I had on earth? Oh! I am miserable. Leon and Alexis. There's hopes yet left to finde her. LEON. Never. Some rude and savage hand has kill'd my Girle, Having deflowr'd her of her virgin honour. Talk not of patience, 'tis the onely meanes To cure a bad distemper, to grow worse, And fire it out of him. Oh my Alexis! ALEXIS. I'm lost in loosing her. Let us endeavour to finde her, LEON. I'le take thy counsell, goodnesse guide me still, Sometimes are Parents crosse against their will. Exeunt. Lysander. Claudia. Florida. LYSANDER. W'are almost at his Cell, where hee do's waste Himselfe away with griefe, thinking you are A Citizen in Heaven, and that wrong He did you, has so defil'd his soule, It cannot be purg'd off but by such penitence. FLORIDA. Y'ave mov'd my heart that it dissolves to teares, Of blood, and water, for the strictnesse hee Has undergone for mee. Enter Cloe and Daphnes. CLOE. I'm glad I've found you; doe you see w'are coupl'd as Lovers ought to doe: but your Gloriana is lost beyond Recovery. LYSANDER. How? DAPHNES. Shee hearing of your death fell frantick, and Since I have not seene her ne're our Groves. LYSANDER. Let us put wings to our pursuit to finde her; And first wee'l search his Cell. CLAVDIA. Great Pan send all things well. Exeunt. FRANCISCO. Oh Conscience, how thou do'st buz into my eares; despaire The thing attends my guilt, Gloriana lost: For whose sweet sake I heap't new sinnes upon me? What has my fury purchas'd nothing? Yes! Hell, and destruction, which onely by a haire hangs o're my head, which blowne by the least winde, falls downe and sinks me. SCRVB. You sirrah, madcap, that creepes like a Crab there: Hark you, doe not you know one Francisco and Pisander, two vagabonds, that cannot live in peace with Poultry, but they must flye after sheepe? FRANCISCO. I owe that wretched name Francisco. SCRUB. Who? you with that face! pray where's Pisander then? FRANC. I left him at the Court when I came thence. SCRUB. I see you shepheards will lye abominably, hee has beene from the Court ever since seven yeares before hee was borne. Lysander. Leon. Gloriana. Claud. Florida. Cloe. Cliton. Daphnes. Alexis. LYSANDER. Friends, wee are happy made, Fortune and Love reserv'd these blisses to crowne the end of things. CLITON. The story you related Florida. How this divine Matron did take your body, Finding it warme, and did apply such Balsames As hath preserv'd your life, makes me most happy. LYSANDER. I'm blest in my Gloriana. DAPHNES. I in my Cloe. CLITON. And I in Florida. Leon, Alexis, Claudia, and Florida. And wee to see you possesse such blisse. FRAN. Ah! Protect me some blest power: keepe farther off. I am yet reconcil'd with heaven. I doe confesse I kill'd you! Oh be mercifull for their sweet sakes, whose innocence cannot see, or be disturb'd by thee. There they are by thee; thy once deare Gloriana. LYSANDER. What a distemper's this? FRANCISCO. What will appease thy Ghost? give me but time to aske forgivenesse of those sacred powers I've most offended, by depriving thee of life and being, and thou shalt have my life for thy just sacrifice. LYSANDER. I apprehend his guilt: shepheard, feare not; your hate grew not to such desperate effects as you expected. Feele, I live and breath! FRAN. Delude me not, 'tis impossible. LYSANDER. These shall witnesse it. OMNES. Wee doe. FRAN. Can you forgive then my attempt? LYSANDER. With a true heart. OMNES. Lysander's still himselfe, noble and wise. FRANCISCO. And can you Fairest wipe that Ignominy off, I deserv'd from you? GLORIANA. My Lysanders word sufficeth for us both. FRAN. Then may you both live happy many yeares: May your joyes, never be disturb'd by feares. SCRUB. Heark you sir, now all your talk is over, I would know one thing of you? LYSANDER. And what's that? SCRUB. Have you met with one Pisander, Leon, and Francisco in your Travailes? The Duke is dead that banisht good old Leon, and could I finde him; his lands shall be restor'd. LEON. I am that Leon that with my sonne and daughter here have liv'd e're since in this Rurall way. OMNES. Blessings doe follow blessings. LYSANDER. Then I am that Pisander that left the Court, to gaine thy Daughters love by the name of Lysander. Scrub, dost thou know me now? SCRVB. A pestlence on't, you are hee indeed. FRAN. Pisander, embrace thy friend Francisco. LYSANDER. Franciso! thou cloy'st me with joy. Embrace. FRAN. I left the Court for the same end you did. LYSANDER. Shee's mine now Sir, is shee not? LEON. As fast as th' Priest can make her, Fortune has made all happy: Yet 'tis fit If they will wed, your hands should licence it.</field>
