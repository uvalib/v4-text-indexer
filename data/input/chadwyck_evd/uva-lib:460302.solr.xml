      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter PYRGOPOLINICES, ARTOTROGUS, and Soldiers. PYRGOPOLINICES. See that the splendour of my shield outshine The sun's bright radiance, when the heav'ns are fair; That, when we join in battle, it may dazzle The enemies eyes throughout their thickest ranks. Fain would I comfort this good sword of mine, Lest he despond in spirit, or lament, For that I wear him unemploy'd, who longs To make a carbonado of the foes.— But where is Artotrogus? Art. He is here, Close by an hero brave and fortunate, And of a princely form,—a warrior! such As Mars himself would not have dar'd to bring His prowess in compare with your's. Pyrg. Who was it In the Gurgustidonian plains I spar'd, Where Bombomachides Cluninstaridysarchides, Great Neptune's grandson, bore the chief command? Art. Oh, I remember—doubtless it is he You mean to speak of, with the golden armour;— Whose legions with your breath you puff'd away Like the light leaves, or chaff before the wind. Pyrg. Oh! that indeed! that on my troth was nothing. Art. Nothing, 'tis true, compar'd with other feats, That I could mention, (aside) which you ne'er perform'd.— Shew me whoever can a greater lyar, One fuller of vain boasting than this fellow, And he shall have me, I'll resign me up To be his slave, though, when I'm mad with hunger, He should allow me nothing else to eat But whey and butter-milk. Pyrg. Where art thou? Art. Here.— How, in the name of wonder, was't you broke In India with your fist an elephant's arm? Pyrg. How! arm? Art. His thigh, I meant. Pyrg. I was but playing. Art. Had you put forth your strength, you would have driv'n Your arm quite through his hide, bones, guts, and all. Pyrg. I would not talk of these things now. Art. Indeed You would but spend your breath in vain to tell Your valorous feats to me, who know your prowess. (Aside) My appetite creats me all this plague; My ears must hear him, or my teeth want work; And I must swear to every lie he utters. Pyrg. Hold,—what was I about to say? Art. I know What you design'd to say;—a gallant action!— I well remember— Pyrg. What? Art. Whate'er it be. Pyrg. Hast thou got tablets? Art. Yes, I have—d'ye want them?— A pencil too. Pyrg. How rarely thou dost suit Thy mind to mine! Art. 'Tis fit that I should study Your inclinations, and my care should be Ev'n to forerun your wishes. Pyrg. What remember'st? Art. I do remember—let me see—an hundred Sycolatronidans—and thirty Sardians,— And threescore Macedonians,—that's the number Of persons, whom you slaughter'd in one day. Pyrg. What's the sum total of these men? Art. Sev'n thousand. Pyrg. So much it should be—thou'rt a right accomptant. Art. I have it not in writing, but remember. Pyrg. Thou hast an admirable memory. Art. 'Tis sharpen'd by my stomach. Pyrg. Bear thyself As thou hast hitherto, and thou shalt eat Eternally,—for ever shalt thou be Partaker of my table. Art. Then again What feats did you perform in Cappadocia! Where at one single stroke you had cut off Five hundred men together, if your sword Had not been blunt, and these but the remains Of th'infantry, which you before had routed,— (Aside) If ever there were any such in being. Why should I tell you, what all mortals know? That Pyrgopolinices stands alone, The only one on earth fam'd above men For beauty, valour, and renown'd exploits. The ladies are enamour'd of you all, Nor without reason,—since you are so handsome; Witness the gay young damsels yesterday, That pluck'd me by the cloak.— Pyrg. (Smiling) What said they to you? Art. They question'd me about you.—Is not that, Says one of them, Achilles?—Troth, said I, It is his brother.—Why indeed forsooth He's wondrous handsome, quoth another:—how His hair becomes him!—O what happiness Those ladies do enjoy, who share his favours! Pyrg. Did she indeed say so? Art. Two in particular Beg'd of me I would you bring by their way, That they might see you march. Pyrg. What plague it is To be too handsome! Art. They are so importunate, They're ever begging for a sight of you; They send for me so often to come to them, I scarce have leisure to attend your business. Pyrg. 'Tis time methinks to go unto the Forum, And pay those soldiers I enlisted yesterday: For king Seleucus pray'd me with much suit To raise him some recruits.—I have resolv'd To dedicate this day unto his service. Art. Come, let's be going then. Pyrg. Guards, follow me. [Exeunt. The End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter PALÆSTRIO. To tell the argument of this our play I have the courtesy, if ye will have The kindness but to hear it. Whoso will not, Let him get up, go out, and to another Resign his seat, that would be glad to hear. I'll tell you now the name and argument Of this same play we are about to act, Por which ye are seated in this mirthful place. In Greek the comedy is stil'd Alazon, Which, render'd in our tongue, we call The Braggard. This town is Ephesus. The Captain, he That went hence to the Forum, is my master, An impudent, vain-glorious, dunghill-fellow, As full of lies as of debauchery. He makes his brag forsooth, that he is follow'd By all the women; though he is the jest Of all, where'er he goes. Our very harlots, That wooe him to their lips, make wry mouths at him. It is not long, since I have been his slave; And I should tell you how, into his service I chanc'd to come from him I serv'd before. Attend: the argument I now begin. I had a master, 'twas the best of youths, At Athens: he upon a damsel doated, (Herself too an Athenian,) she on him;— And sweet the cultivation of such love! My master on a public embassy Went to Naupactum, on account and part Of our most high republic: in the interim This captain, who by chance to Athens came, Insinuates himself into her company, My master's love; sets him about to coax And wheedle the good mother with his presents Of gewgaw ornaments, his precious wines, And costly banquets, so that he becomes An intimate familiar with the bawd. Soon as occasion did present, he trick'd This bawd her mother, and without her knowledge Seiz'd on the girl, clap'd her on board a ship, And carried her against her will to Ephesus. Soon as I learn'd, that she was borne away From Athens, I, with all the speed I could, Got me a vessel, and embark'd, to bear The tidings to my master at Naupactum. When we were out at sea, the pirates took The vessel I was in, a prize to them Most grateful, and I found myself undone, Ere I could reach the place where I was going. The rogue, that took us, gave me to this captain: When he had brought me home unto his house, Whom should I see there but this very damsel, Her whom my master lov'd, who was at Athens! She saw me on her side, and with her eyes Gave me a sign not to take notice of her, Nor call her by her name. After a while, When she had opportunity, the damsel 'Plain'd to me of her fortunes,—said, she long'd To fly from hence to Athens, that she lov'd My master the Athenian, hated no one Worse than this captain. Soon as I had learnt The damsel's sentiments, I took a tablet, Seal'd it in private, gave it to a merchant To carry to my master, the girl's lover, That hither he might haste. He slighted not The message,—for he's come, and now he lodges In the next house here with his father's friend, Who seconds his fond guest in his amour, And aids us both in counsel and in deed. A grand contrivance have I therefore form'd, That they may meet together, these two lovers: For in the chamber, giv'n her by the captain For no one to set foot in but herself, I've dug an opening through into this house, With the consent of our old neighbour,—nay Himself advis'd it.—Now my fellow-servant, Appointed by the captain for her keeper, Is a dull rascal, and of little worth: With pleasant stratagems and quaint devices We'll cast so thick a film athwart his eyes, Shall make him not to see what he shall see. But I should tell you, to prevent mistakes, The damsel will perform a double part, And bear the form and image of two persons, Now here, now there; but she will be the same, Though she will counterfeit herself another: So shall her keeper be most rarely gull'd.— I hear a noise here at our neighbour's door: 'Tis he himself comes out. This, this is he, The pleasant brisk old fellow, that I spoke of. SCENE II. Enter PERIPLECTOMENES, speaking to his Servants within. If ye don't break his legs, whatever stranger Ye shall hereafter see upon the tiles, Your sides shall suffer for't.—Why now forsooth, My neighbours, they are witnesses of all That passes in my house, when thus they look Down through the sky-light.—I command you all, Whomever ye shall see upon the tiles Belonging to this captain here, except Palæstrio only, push him headlong down Into the street, though he pretends forsooth That he is only looking for an hen, A pigeon, or a monkey: Woe be to you, If you don't beat the rascal e'en to death. Pal. Something is done amiss, I know not what, To the old fellow by our family, As far as I can hear, since he has order'd That they should break my fellow servant's legs: But me he has excepted: nothing care I, How he shall serve the rest. I'll make up to him. Is he not coming tow'rds me? Sure he is.— Periplectomenes! your servant, Sir. Per. Oh,—if I were to wish, there are not many I'd rather see and talk with than yourself. Pal. Why? wherefore? what's the matter? Per. All's discover'd! Pal. What all's discover'd? Per. From our tiles e'en now One of your family, I know not who, Saw through the sky-light all that past within; Philocomasium and my guest he saw Exchanging kisses. Pal. Ha—who saw them? Per. 'Twas Your fellow-servant. Pal. Which? Per. I know not that, So suddenly he took himself away. Pal. My ruin I suspect. Per. As he went off, “Hoa there, cried I, what do you on our tiles?” The runaway replied, he had been seeking A monkey that had stray'd. Pal. Ah me! that I Should suffer for a beast so little worth.— But is the lady with you still? Per. She was, When I came out. Pal. Then, soon as e'er she can, Bid her return to us, that our domestics May see she is at home, unless she wills, That we poor servants should be put to torture By reason of her love. Per. I bade her do it: Would you ought else? Pal. I would. Pray tell her this; She must use cunning, prove her an apt scholar, And hold unchang'd her colour. Per. Wherefore? how? Pal. That he, who saw her, may be wrought upon To think he saw her not: nay, though he saw her An hundred times, she must deny it still. She has a lying tongue, a wit that's ripe For mischief, an assurance so undaunted, Nothing can shake it: whosoe'er accuse her, She would not stick at perjury to refute him. She has at home, within herself, a mind Fraught with false words, false actions, and false oaths, Tricks, stratagems, devices, and intrigues. Nor need a woman, that is bent on ill, Seek from abroad the means, who is herself All plot. Per. I'll tell her this, if she's within here. But what is it, Palæstrio, in your mind You're with yourself revolving? Pal. Peace awhile,— While that I call a council in my breast, Consulting how to act, what craft t'oppose Against my crafty fellow-servant, he Who saw the lovers billing,—so that what Was seen may not be seen. Per. I prithee, seek it: Mean time I'll get me at a distance from you.— (Retires. Look!—how he stands apart, with brow severe, As wrapt in thought, and full of cares:—His hand Knocks at his breast;—I fancy, he's about To call his heart out. See, he shifts his posture, And leaning his left elbow on his thigh The fingers of his right hand he employs, As it should seem, in reckoning some account; And his right thigh he smites so vehemently, As speaks him with his thoughts dissatisfied: And now he snaps his fingers: how he's work'd! And ever and anon he shifts his place: See, see, he nods his head: he likes it not, What he has hit upon; for nothing crude Will he at length bring forth, but well digested. But see, he builds his head up, and his arm Serves as a pillar to support his chin. Fye, fye,—in troth I do not like this building; For I have heard a certain poet us'd To lean his head upon his elbow thus, And in close custody he liv'd confin'd. Bravo! O brave! how well he plays his part! Ne'er will he rest, till he has perfected What he's in search of.—Oh, he has it sure.— Come—to the business—mind what you're about: Awake, and do not sleep; unless you chuse To have your back chequer'd with stripes: Awake, I tell you: don't be idle: Hoa, 'tis I That speak to you, Palæstrio: Wake, I say; Why wake, I say: 'tis day-light, man. Pal. I hear you. Per. Do you not see your foes are coming on you? Do you not know they'll lay siege to your back? Consult on measures then; procure assistance: Do it with speed; no sluggishness is fitting: Get of your foes the start; draw forth your army; Besiege them first; and for yourself provide A safe-guard and defence; cut off their convoys; Secure yourself a passage, that provisions May unmolested reach you and your troops. Look to the business: the affair is sudden: Invent, contrive, find some expedient strait, Some counsel on the spot, that what was seen May seem not seen, what done not done at all. Grand is the enterprize: yet say the word, That you will take it on yourself alone, My heart is confident that we shall rout them. Pal. I say it then,—I take it on myself. Per. And I, whatever you require, will grant. Pal. Heav'ns bless you! Per. But, good friend, impart to me What is it you've devis'd. Pal. Then list in silence, While I admit you to the misteries Of all my cunning: you shall know my counsels Ev'n as myself. Per. What you entrust me with You shall have back entire upon demand. Pal. My master's thicker than the elephant's hide, Has no more wisdom than a stone. Per. I know it. Pal. Now this is my devise: I will pretend That a twin-sister of Philocomasium (As like her as one drop of milk to another) Is with a certain gallant come from Athens, And that they lodge with you. Per. O bravo! bravo! An exquisite conceit! I 'plaud your thought. Per. So if my fellow servant should accuse Our lady to the captain, that he saw her Caressing of another, on my part I'll argue t'was her sister that he saw, With her own lover kissing and embracing. Per. Most excellent! And I will say the same, If that the captain should enquire of me. Pal. Be sure you say, they are most like each other: The lady too must be instructed, lest He catch her tripping, should he question her. Per. Most artful the contrivance!—But suppose That he should want to see them both together In the same place:—What then is to be done? Pal. That's easy: you may find enough excuses: She's not at home, she is gone out a walking, She is asleep, she's dressing, she is bathing, She's busy, she's at dinner, not at leisure, She cannot come: as many as you will Of these put-offs you'll readily think on, if We can induce him to believe at once Our first grand fib. Per. It likes me what you say. Pal. Then go you in, and if the lady's with you, Bid her come home to us immediately. Acquaint her with these matters, and instruct her, That she may comprehend the plot, which now We're entering on, concerning her twin-sister. Per. I warrant, you shall find her aptly tutor'd. Would you ought else? (Going.) Pal. No, go, Sir. Per. I am gone. [Exit Periplectomenes. SCENE III. PALÆSTRIO alone. And I'll go home too, use my best endeavours To trace my man out: but I must dissemble, (A stranger to the matter I,) to learn Which of my fellow-servants 'twas, to-day That sought this monkey: for it cannot be, But he must prate to some one of our family About my master's lady, how he saw her Next door caressing of a stranger spark. I know their manners, and myself alone Of all our house have learn'd to hold my tongue. If I do find him, my whole armament I'll plant against him: all things are prepared; And for a certainty my force must conquer him. If I don't find him, like an hound I'll go Smelling about, until I shall have traced My fox out by his track. But our door creaks: My voice I'll lower: here comes my fellow-servant, The guardian of Philocomasium. SCENE IV. Enter SCELEDRUS. If I have not been walking in my sleep Upon the tiles, I'm certain that I saw My master's lady in our neighbour's house; And she has sought her out another lover. Pal. As far as I can learn, 'twas he then saw her. Sce. Who's that? Pal. Your fellow-servant.—So, Sceledrus! How fares it? Sce. O Palæstria! I am glad I've met you. Pal. How now? what's the matter? Tell me. Sce. I fear— Pal. What fear you? Sce. That we all shall dance To the musick of a cudgel. Pal. Nay, do you Dance by yourself: for me, I like it not, This jigging work, this capering up and down. Sce. Haply you do not know, what new mischance Has just befall'n us. Pal. What mischance? Sce. A filthy. Pal. Then keep it to yourself, don't tell it me, I would not know it. Sce. But you must.—To-day, As I was looking for our monkey, here Upon our neighbour's tiles— Pal. One worthless beast Was looking for another. Sce. Plague confound you! Pal. You rather.—But go on, as you've begun. Sce. I haply chanc'd to peep down through the sky-light Into next house, and there did I espy Our lady fondling with I know not whom, Another spark. Pal. What do I hear you say? A villainous scandal!— Sce. By my troth I saw her. Pal. What, you? Sce. Yes, I myself, with both these eyes. Pal. Go, go, it is not likely what you say; Nor did you see her. Sce. How? do I appear, As if my eye-sight fail'd me? Pal. You had better Ask a physician that.—But as you wish The Gods to love you, do not rashly foster This idle story, or you will create A capital mischief to your head, and heels too. For if you do not stop your foolish chattering, A two-fold ruin waits you. Sce. But how two-fold? Pal. I'll tell you. First, if falsely you accuse Our lady, woe be to you; and again, Suppose it true, yet woe be to you,—you Her guardian. Sce. What will me befal, I know not; But I do know for certain, that I saw her. Pal. Dost thou persist in't, thou unhappy wretch? Sce. What would you have me say, but that I saw her? Moreover she's within here at this instant, Here at next door. Pal. How? is she not at home? Sce. Go yourself in, and see; for I will ask you To credit me in nothing. Pal. I will do it. Sce. I'll wait you here. [Palæstrio goes in. SCENE V. SCELEDRUS alone. The same time will I watch, Till our stray'd heifer shall return from grazing To her old stable.—What now shall I do?— The captain gave me charge of her, and now If I impeach her, I'm undone;—again, If I am silent, and 'tis blaz'd abroad, I then too am undone.—What can be more Abandon'd, more audacious, than a woman? The while I was upon the tiles, this hussy Stole out o'doors.—A most audacious act! And should the captain know it, on my troth He'd pull the house down,—tuck me up directly.— No, no, I'll hold my tongue, rather than end My days so scurvily.—I cannot guard One that will sell herself. SCENE VI. Enter PALÆSTRIO. Sceledrus! Hoa! Sce. Who is't that calls so menacing and loud? Pal. Lives there a falser knave, or any born Under a planet more unlucky? Sce. Why? Pal. Prithee dig out those eyes, with which you see What never was. Sce. What never was? Pal. I wouldn't Give ev'n a rotten nut now for your life. Sce. Why, what's the matter? Pal. Ask you, what's the matter? Sce. Why not? Pal. Prithee cut out that tongue of thine, Which prates so freely and at large. Sce. For why? Pal. Lo! she's at home, whom you affirm'd you saw Next door embracing of another spark. Sce. I marvel you should chuse to feed on darnel, When corn's so cheap Pal. What do you mean? Sce. Because You are dim-sighted. Pal. Out, you rascal! you Are not indeed dim-sighted, but stark blind: For she's at home, I tell you. Sce. How! at home? Pal. She's most assuredly at home. Sce. Go, go, You make an handle of me for your sport. Pal. So,—then my hands are dirty. Sce. Why? Pal. Because I've handled such a dirty thing. Sce. A mischief Light on your head! Pal. It will on your's, I promise you, If you don't change your language, and your eyes. But our door creaks. Sce. I watch it narrowly: For she can pass no way but by the fore door. Pal. I tell you, she's at home.—I know not what Strange fancies you're possess'd with. Sce. For myself I see, and for myself I think, myself I have most faith in; nor shall any one Persuade me, that she is not in this house. (Pointing to Periplectomenes's house.) Here then I'll plant me, that she may'nt steal out Without my knowledge. Pal. (Aside) Oh,—the man's my own:— I'll drive him from his strong hold. (To Sce.) Shall I make you Own you are simple-sighted? Sce. Do. Pal. And that You neither think, nor see aright? Sce. I'd have you. Pal. Do you not say the lady's here? Sce. I'll swear I saw her here, caressing of another. Pal. Do you not know, there's no communication Betwixt our house and this? Sce. I know it. Pal. Neither Terrace, nor garden,—nothing but the sky-light. Sce. I know it well. Pal. Then, if she be at home, And she come out before your eyes, you'll own An hearty drubbing is your due. Sce. My due. Pal. Guard well that door then, lest she privily Steal forth, and pass to us. Sce. 'Tis my intent To do so. Pal. I will set her here before you. Sce. Pray do. [Palæstrio goes in. SCENE VII. SCELEDRUS alone. I would fain know, if I have seen What I have seen, or whether he can prove, That she's at home.—I've eyes sure of my own, And need not borrow others.—But this rogue,— He pays his court to her; he's ever near her; He's call'd to meals first, serv'd first with his mess.— 'Tis now three years or thereabouts, since he Has liv'd with us, and no one of the family Fares better than his knaveship.—I must mind What I'm about though:—I must watch this door.— Then here I'll plant myself.—No, no,—I warrant you, They'll ne'er impose on me. SCENE VIII. Enter PALÆSTRIO and PHILOCOMASIUM. PALÆSTRIO to PHILOCOMASIUM, entering. Be sure, that you Remember my instructions. Phil. It is strange, You should so oft remind me. Pal. But I fear You are not read enough in cunning. Phil. Prithee I could school those, who are themselves proficients. I have known women, famous for their arts; But I alone surpass them. Pal. Come then—Now, Now put your tricks in force.—I'll get me from you. (To Sce.) Sceledrus!—Why d'ye stand thus? Sce. I'm about My business:—I have ears;—speak, what's your pleasure? Pal. You'll shortly march, I fancy, in this posture Without the Metian gate, bearing along A gibbet with your hands spread out thus. Sce. Why? Pal. Look there,—upon your left.—Who is that woman? Sce. Immortal Gods! 'tis she,—our master's lady! Pal. And so I think indeed.—Do, prithee now— Sce. Do what?— Pal. Go, hang yourself this instant. Phil. (Advancing.) Where Is this good servant, who accus'd me wrongfully Of indiscretion, me who am most innocent? Pal. See! there he is.—He told me.— Sce. I did tell you. Phil. Villain!—who was it, that you said you saw me Embracing at next door? Pal. A stranger spark, He said. Sce. I said so verily. Phil. You saw me? Sce. Yes, with these eyes. Phil. Those eyes you'll lose, I fancy, Which see more than they see. Sce. By heav'n I never Can be convinc'd, but what I saw I saw. Phil. I am a fool, have too much lack of wit, To parley with this madman,—whom I'll punish. Sce. Pray spare your threats.—I know the gallows waits me, A sepulchre where all my ancestors Have gone before me,—father, grandfather, Great grand-father, and great great grandfather.— Yet all your menaces can't dig my eyes out.— A word with you, Palæstrio.—Prithee now Whence came she hither? Pal. Whence but from our house? Sce. Our house? Pal. And in your sight too. Sce. True, I saw her. (Aside.) Tis strange, how she got in; for verily Our house has neither terrace, garden, no Nor window, but is grated.—(To Phil.) I am sure I saw you at next door. Pal. What! still persist, You rascal! to accuse her? Phil. In good sooth The dream I dreamt last night now turns out true. Pal. What did you dream? Phil. I'll tell you: but I pray you, Lend me your serious ear.—Last night methought I saw my sister, my twin-sister, who Was come from Athens here to Ephesus With a young spark, and that they lodg'd next door. Sce. The dream she's telling is Palæstrio's. Pal. On pray. Phil. Methought it joy'd me much my sister's coming, But I lay under a most strong suspicion On her account: for, as it seem'd, the slave Appointed me, as is the case ev'n now, Accused me of caressing a strange spark, When 'twas my sister fondling with her lover.— Thus did I dream, myself was falsely censured. Pal. The like befalls you waking, which you say Your sleep presented.—See, how all things tally! Go in now, and address the Gods.—I think, You should acquaint the captain with this matter. Phil. I am resolv'd to do it:—I'll not suffer My honour wrongfully to be impeach'd, And let the insult pass unpunished. (Goes into the Captain's house. SCENE IX. SCELEDRUS, PALÆSTRIO. SCELEDRUS. I tremble for the consequence,—my back Does tingle so all over! Pal. Know you not, That you're undone?—She's now at home for certain. Sce. Where'er she be, I'll watch our door for certain. (Places himself before the Captain's door.) Pal. But pray, what think you of this dream she dreamt? How like it was to what has past,—as how You should suspect, you saw her with a lover? Sce. And do you think, I did not see her? Pal. Prithee Repent thee.—Should this reach our master's ear, You are undone for ever! Sce. I am now At length convinc'd, that I have had a mist Before my eyes. Pal. That long ago was plain: For she has been at home here all the while. Sce. I know not what to say: I did not see her, Though I did see her. Pal. Verily by your folly You've near undone us: wishing to appear True to your master, you have near been ruin'd.— But heark—I hear a noise at the next door.— I'll say no more. SCENE X. Enter PHILOCOMASIUM, from Periplectomenes's House. (To a servant within.) Put fire upon the altar, That, when my bathing's ended, I may pour My thanks and praises to Ephesian Dian, With fragrant incense of Arabian sweets: For she has sav'd me in the watry realms Of Neptune, in his boisterous temples, where With unrelenting billows I was tost, And sore dismay'd. Sce. (Discovering her.) Palæstrio, O Palæstrio! Pal. Sceledrus, O Sceledrus!—Well,—what would you? Sce. That lady,—see there,—who came out from hence This instant,—say, is she Philocomasium? Or is she not? Pal. Truly I think it her.— But it is strange, how she could get there,—if Indeed she be the same. Sce. And do you doubt, If it be she? Pal. 'Tis like her.—Let's approach, And speak to her. Sce. Philocomasium!—hoa!— How's this?—What business have you in that house? Why are you silent? 'Tis to you I speak. Pal. Nay verily you speak but to yourself; For nothing does she answer. Sce. Shameless woman! To you I speak,—you, that thus roam about Among the neighbours! Phil. Whom d'ye speak to? Sce. Whom, But to yourself? Phil. Who are you? and what business Have you with me? Sce. Hey!—Ask you, who I am? Phil. And why not ask you, what I do not know? Pal. Pray who am I then, if you know not him? Phil. A very troublesome, whoe'er you are,— Both you and he. Sce. What! don't you know us then? Phil. No,—neither. Sce. I do greatly fear— Pal. What fear you? Sce. That we have lost ourselves somewhere or other; For she knows neither you, she says, nor me. Pal. Let us examine, if we are ourselves, Or else some other:—may be, they have chang'd us Without our knowledge. Sce. Surely I am I. Pal. And so am I. (To Phil.)—Lady, you seek your ruin.— Philocomasium! hoa!—to you I speak. Phil. What madness does possess you thus to call me By a strange name? Pal. Oh ho! how are you call'd then? Phil. My name is Glycere. Pal. Fye now, this is wrong.— You'd go by a false name.—'Tis not becoming, And truly you do wrong my master by it. Phil. I? Pal. You. Phil. I came but yesterday to Ephesus From Athens, with my young Athenian lover. Pal. Tell me, what business have you here at Ephesus? Phil. I heard, that my twin-sister sojourn'd here, And came to seek her. Pal. O thou art a sad one! Phil. I am a fool to hold discourse with you.— I'll go. Sce. (Laying hold of her.) But I'll not let you. Phil. Loose me. Sce. No,— 'Tis plain!—I will not quit you. Phil. But I'll make Your cheeks ring, if you don't let go. Sce. Palæstrio?— Plague:—why do you stand still?—why don't you hold her On t'other side? Pal. I do not chuse to bring A business on my back.—How do I know, Whether she be Philocomasium, or Some other, that is like her? Phil. Will you loose me, Or will you not? Sce. No,—I will drag you home By force, against your will, except you'll gently Go of your own accord. Phil. (Pointing to Periplectomenes's house.) My lodging's here,— This door.—At Athens I've an home, and patron.— Your home I reck not; neither do I know, What men ye are. Sce. Seek your redress by law.— I'll never loose you, till you give your word, That, if I do so, you will go in here. (To the Captain's) Phil. Me you by force compel, whoe'er you are.— I promise, if you loose me, I will go In there, where you command. Sce. Then,—I do loose you. Phil. And I, as I am free, will go in here. (Runs into Periplectomenes's house.) SCENE XI. SCELEDRUS, PALÆSTRIO. Sce. Fool that I was, to trust a woman's honour! Pal. So,—you have let the prey slip through your hands, Sceledrus! Sce. It is her, as sure as can be,— My master's lady. Pal. Will you act with spirit? Sce. Act what? Pal. Bring me a cutlass. Sce. What to do? Pal. I'll break into the house, and whomsoe'er I see caressing of Philocomasium, I'll kill him on the spot. Sce. And do you think, 'Twas her? Pal. Oh, plainly her. Sce. But how the jade Dissembled! Pal. Go, and bring a cutlass hither. Sce. It shall be here directly. [Sceledrus goes in. SCENE XII. PALÆSTRIO alone. Not a soldier, Of horse or foot, can prove himself so bold, As can a woman.—How she topt her part In both her characters! how charmingly She gull'd my fellow-servant, her wise keeper! That opening thro' her chamber-wall, how happy! SCENE XIII. Enter SCELEDRUS. Palæstrio!—We have no need of the cutlass. Pal. What then? Sce. Our master's lady is at home. Pal. How? What! at home? Sce. She's lying in her bed. Pal. You've brought yourself into an ugly scrape.— Sce. Why? Pal. That you've dar'd to touch this neighbour-lady. Sce. I fear it much.—Now no one shall convince me, But that it must be her twin-sister. Pal. True,— 'Twas her you saw caressing.—It is plain,— It must be her,—e'en as you say. Sce. How near To ruin was I, had I told my master! Pal. Then, if you're wise, henceforth you'll hold your tongue.— A servant ought to know more than he speaks.— I'll leave you to your thoughts alone;—I'll now Unto our neighbour's.—I don't like these turmoils: My master if he comes, and asks for me, I will be here directly.—Call me hence. (Goes into Periplectomenes's house. SCENE XIV. SCELEDRUS alone. So—Is he gone?—A pretty fellow this!— He cares not for his master's business more Than if he weren't his servant!—I am sure, Our lady is within here; for I found her At home, and in her bed, this very instant. But I'm resolv'd to be upon the watch. (Places himself before the Captain's door. SCENE XV. Enter PERIPLECTOMENES. Why sure these fellows here, these varlet-knaves, These servants of our neighbour captain,—What? They take me for a woman, not a man; To make me thus their pastime! in the street T'assault and use such freedoms with my lodger, (Who with her lover is from Athens come,) A modest, and a gentle.— Sce. I am ruin'd; He bears down strait upon me. I'm afraid, This same affair will bring me to great trouble, As much as I have heard this old man talk. Per. I'll up to him.—Sceledrus! was it you, A rascal as you are, that dar'd affront My lodger here just now before my door? Sce. Good neighbour, I beseech you, hear. Per. I hear you? Sce. I would fain clear me. Per. How! you clear you? You, Who've put such gross indignities upon me?— Because ye serve a soldier, do ye think, That ye may do whate'er ye list?—You rascal! Sce. May I— Per. But let the Gods ne'er prosper me, If I don't have you punish'd with a whipping, A long and lasting one, from morn to even: First, that you broke my gutters and my tiles, In seeking for a monkey like yourself; Next, that you peep'd down thence into my house, And saw my lodger fondling with his mistress; Then, that you dar'd accuse your master's lady, (A modest,) of incontinence, and me Of a most heinous action; further, that You dar'd assault my lodger at my door. And if you are not punish'd with due stripes, Your master I will load so with disgrace, He shall be fuller of it than the sea Of billows in a storm. Sce. Periplectomenes, I'm driven to such a strait, I know not whether 'Twere fitter to dispute this matter with you, Or clear myself before you: for if she Be not the lady, then our lady is not; Nor do I even know now what I've seen; So very like your lady is to our's, If not the same. Per. Go to my house, and see; You soon will know. Sce. Will you permit me? Per. Nay, I do command:—examine at your leisure. Sce. And so I will. (Sceledrus goes into Periplectomenes's house. SCENE XVI. PERIPLECTOMENES calling through the Window. Philocomasium, hoa, Pass with what speed you can into our house; The affair is pressing: after, when Sceledrus Shall have come out, return you with like speed To your own house.—I fear, lest she mistake. Should he not see her here, our trick's discover'd. SCENE XVII. SCELEDRUS entering. O heav'ns! one woman sure more like another, And, if the same she be not, more the same I do not think the Gods can make. Per. What now? Sce. I merit chastisement. Per. So—Is it her? Sce. Though it be her, it is not. Per. Have you seen her? Sce. I saw her, fondling with the youth your guest. Per. And is it her? Sce. I know not. Per. Would you know For certain? Sce. I could wish it. Per. Go you in This instant to your own house, and see whether Your lady be within. Sce. I'll do so: rightly You have advised me: I'll return forthwith. (He goes into the Captain's house. Per. I never saw a man so sweetly fool'd, And by such rare devices.—But he's coming. SCENE XVIII. Enter SCELEDRUS. Periplectomenes! by Gods and men I do beseech you, by my own folly, By these your knees— Per. What is it, you'd beseech me? Sce. Pardon my ignorance, my folly pardon, Since now at length I know I am half-witted, Blind, and unthinking; for Philocomasium, Behold! she is at home. Per. Why, how now, hang-dog? Hast seen them both? Sce. I've seen them. Per. Prithee send Your master to me. Sce. I indeed confess, That I have deserv'd most ample chastisement, And done an injury to your fair lodger: But I believ'd she was my master's lady, Of whom I had the charge; for never can there From the same well be drawn one drop of water More like another, than our lady is To this your lodger:—And I do confess too, I look'd into your house down through the sky-light. Per. Confess indeed! what I myself did see. Sce. I fancy'd, that I saw Philocomasium. Per. And do you rate me at so small a price Of all mankind, to think that wittingly I e'er could suffer such an injury, So glaring, in my house, and to my neighbour? Sce. Now do I judge at last, that I have done Most foolishly, since now I know the truth:— Yet with no ill intent. Per. 'Twas wrongly done. A servant should restrain his eyes, and hands, And speech too. Sce. —I?—If I but mutter ought From this day forward, ev'n of what I know Myself for certain, put me to the torture, I'll give me up to you. Now I beseech you To pardon me this once.— Per. I shall persuade me, 'Twas with no ill intent: I pardon you. Sce. May the Gods prosper you! Per. And verily, If you would have them prosper you, your tongue Henceforward you'll restrain: what you shall know, You'll know not, and not see, what you shall see. Sce. You counsel me aright: I am resolv'd To do so.—But I hope, you are appeas'd. Would you ought else? Per. That you would know me not. Sce. (Aside) He has cajol'd me.—How benignly he Vouchsafed his grace no longer to be angry! I know what he's about:—he means, the captain Should catch me here at home, when he returns (As shortly I expect him) from the Forum.— He and Palæstrio together hold me At their disposal:—but I've found it out, And some time have I known it.—Verily They shall not catch me nibbling at their bait: I'll now take to my heels, and for some days I'll hide me somewhere, till the storm is hush'd, And their resentment soften'd.—I have merited Enough, and more of chastisement.—But yet,— Whate'er befall me,—I will e'en go home. [Exit. SCENE XIX. PERIPLECTOMENES alone. So,—he is gone then.—Well—the proof, they say, Is in the eating.—That he should be wrought on, To think he has not seen what he has seen! For now his eyes, his ears, his very thoughts Have, as it were, deserted, and come o'er To us.—So—hitherto we've managed rarely:— The lady play'd her part most charmingly.— I'll back unto our senate; for Palæstrio Is in my house; Sceledrus,—he's away.— Now we may hold a full and frequent senate: I'll in then, lest they fine me for my absence. [Goes in. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. PALÆSTRIO, to Periplectomenes and Pleusides in entering. Stay ye awhile within doors, let me first Look out, lest any where an ambuscade Be plac'd against the council we would hold: For now we need a safe and secret place, Where never enemy can win the spoils By intercepting of our private counsels, Where never enemy can win the spoils By over-hearing our deliberations: For what is well advis'd is ill advis'd, The foe if it advantage; and it can't be But, if it profit him, it hurteth me. Good counsels many a time are filch'd from us, If that the place for speaking be not chose With care and caution: for if once the enemy Learn your deliberations, they can tye Your tongue, and bind your hands, with your own counsel, And do the same to you, you would to them.— But I will spy abroad, lest any one To right or left should be upon the hunt To catch our counsels with his ears, like toils.— The prospect through the street is desart quite, Ev'n to the farthest end.—I'll call them out.— Periplectomenes, and Pleusides, Come forth. SCENE II. Enter PERIPLECTOMENES and PLEUSIDES, PERIPLECTOMENES. Behold us here obedient to you. Pal. The sway is easy o'er the just and good.— But I would know now, if we are to act According to the plan we form'd within. Per. There's nothing our affair can profit more. Pal. You, Pleusides, say, what is your opinion? Pleu. Can it displease me, ought that pleases you? (To Per.) Who can I call my friend more than yourself? Per. You say what is obliging. Pal. So he should do. Pleu. But, Sir, this hurts me,—to the very soul Torments me. Per. What is't, that torments you?—Tell me. Pleu. To think I should engage you in an act So young and puerile,—one of your years,— So unbecoming of you and your virtue;— That you should forward me with all your might In my amour;—for you to do such things, Which age like your's doth more avoid than follow! It shames me, I should trouble thus your age. Per. You are a lover, man, of a new mode, That you can blush at any thing you do. Go, go, you nothing love.—A lover? No, The semblance you, and shadow of a lover. Ple. Can it be right in me, Sir, to employ One of your age to second my amour? Per. How say you? do I then appear to you One o'th'next world already? do I seem So near my grave, and to have liv'd so long? Why troth I am not above fifty four:— I have my eye-sight clear, and I can use My hands, and walk well with my feet. Pal. What though His hair be grey, he is not old in mind: The same ingenuous temper still is in him. Pleu. True—I have found it, as you say, Palæstrio: For he is kind and free as any youth. Per. Good guest, the more you try, the more you'll know My courtesy towards you in your love. Pleu. Needs he conviction, who's convinc'd already? Per. Only that you may have sufficient proof At home, so as abroad you need not seek it.— He who has never been himself in love, Can hardly see into a lover's mind: For my part I have still some little spice Of love and moisture in my frame; nor am I Dried up as yet, or dead to love and pleasure. And I can crack my joke at merry meetings, And be a boon companion: I ne'er thwart Another in discourse, but bear in mind, To give offence to no one: I can take My part and due share in the conversation; But I am silent, when another's speaking: No spitting, hawking, snivelling dotard I: In fine I'm right Ephesian born and bred, Not an Apulian, or an Umbrian. Pal. What a facetious brave old gentleman, If he possess the qualities he mentions! Sure he was brought up in the school of Venus. Per. I'll give you proofs of my complacency, More than I'll vaunt. At table I ne'er clamour On state affairs, or prate about the laws: Nor do I ever, in the social hour, Once cast a lewd glance at another's mistress: Nor do I snatch the tid-bits to myself, Or seize upon the cup before my turn: Strife and dissention never do arise From me through wine;—if any one offend me, I go me home, and break off further parley: When in the ladies company, I then Resign me up to sprightliness and love. Pleu. Sir, your whole manners have a special grace: Shew me but three men like you, and I'll forfeit Their weight to you in gold. Pal. You shall not find Another of his age, that's more accomplish'd, More throughly to his friend a friend. Per. I'll make you Own, in my manners I'm a very youngster; I'll shew myself so ready to oblige. Need you an advocate t'inforce your suit, Rude, and of fiery temper? I am he. Need you a mild and gentle? You shall say, I'm gentler than the sea, when it is hush'd, And softer than the Zephyr's balmy breeze. A jovial buck am I, a first-rate wit, And best of caterers: then as for dancing, No finical slim fop can equal me. Pal. (To Pleu.) Of all these excellent accomplishments, Which would you chuse, were you to have the option? Pleu. I would at least, my poor thanks could be equal To his deserts, and your's; for I have giv'n you A world of trouble.—But it much concerns me, Th'expence I put you to. (To Per.) Per. You are a fool;— Expence forsooth!—Upon an enemy, Or a bad wife, whatever you lay out, That is expence indeed! But on a friend, Or a good guest, what you expend is gain: As also, what it costs in sacrifices, Is by the wise and virtuous counted profit.— Blest be the Gods, that courtesy I have With hospitality to treat a stranger. Eat, drink, and take your pleasure with me; load Yourself with merriment; my house is free, I free, and I would have you use me freely. For, by the Gods kind favour I may say it, I from my fortune might have ta'en a wife Of the best family, and well portion'd too: But I don't chuse to bring into my house An everlasting barker. Pleu. Why not marry? 'Tis a sweet burthen to have children. Per. Troth 'Tis sweeter far to have one's liberty. Pal. Sir, you are able to direct yourself, And give advice to others. Per. A good wife,— If there was ever such an one on earth,— Where can I find her?—Shall I bring home one, That never will address me in this fashion? “Buy me some wool, my dear, that I may make you “A garment soft and warm, good winter cloathing, “To keep your limbs from starving.” Not a word Like this you'll ever hear come from a wife:— But, ere the cock crow, from my sleep she'd rouze me, Crying—“My dear, pray give me wherewithal “I may present my mother in the Calends:— “Get me a cook; and get me a confectioner:— “Give something to bestow in the Quinquatria “On the diviner, on th'enchantress, on “The soothsayer:—it were an heinous crime “To send them nothing;—how they'd look upon me!— “And then it can't be, but I must present “The sorceress with some kind and gentle token:— “The taper-bearer is already angry, “That she has nothing had:—the midwife too “Upbraids me, that she has so little sent her:— “What!—won't you then send something to the nurse, “That brings your slaves up, born beneath your roof?” These, and a thousand other like expences, Brought on by women, fright me from a wife, Who'd plague and teaze me with the like discourses. Pal. The Gods in troth befriend you; for if once You lose that liberty which now you hold, You will not easily be re-instated. Pleu. Yet 'tis a reputation for a man Of noble family and ample state, To breed up children, as a monument Unto himself and race. Per. Why need I children, When that I have relations in abundance?— I now live well and happily,—as I like, And to my heart's content.—Upon my death, My fortune I'll bequeath to my relations, Dividing it among them.—They eat with me, Make me their care, see what I have to do, Or what I want; are with me before day, To ask if I have slept well over-night: They are to me as children: they are ever Sending me presents: when they sacrifice, I have a larger portion than themselves: They take me to the entrails: they invite me To dine, to sup with them: he counts himself The most unfortunate, that fends me least: They vie with one another in their presents; When to myself I whisper all the while, Aye, aye, it is my fortune they gape after, And therefore strive they in their gifts to me. Pal. You see things with a clear discerning spirit. While you are well and hearty, we may say You've children thick and three-fold. Per. Had I had, I should have had anxiety enough On their account: I think I should have died, If son of mine had had a fall in liquor, Or tumbled from his horse; so great had been My dread, that he had broke a leg at least, If not his neck.—And then my apprehensions, Lest that my wife should bring a monstrous brood, Deform'd, and mark'd,—some bandy-leg'd, knock-kneed, Or shambling, squint-eyed, tusk-tooth'd brat or other. Pal. This gentleman deserves an ample fortune, And to have life continued to him long; For why? he keeps him within bounds, and yet Lives well, and is a pleasure to his friends. Pleu. What a sweet fellow!—As I hope heav'n's love, 'Twere fit the Gods should order and provide, That all men should not hold their lives alike, Squar'd by one rule: but as a price is fix'd On different wares, that so they may be sold According to their value;—that the bad It's owner may impoverish by it's vileness;— So it were just, the Gods in human life Should make distinction due, and disproportion; That on the well-disposed they should bestow A long extent of years; the reprobate And wicked they should soon deprive of life. Were this provided, bad men would be fewer, Less hardily they'd act their wicked deeds, Nor would there be a dearth of honest men. Per. Whoever blames the counsels of the Gods, And finds fault with them, is a fool and ignorant.— No more then of these matters.—I'll to market, That I may entertain you as I ought, And as you should be treated,—with good cheer And a kind hearty welcome. Pleu. Shall I then Have no remorse in putting you to charge? Whene'er a man is quarter'd at a friend's, If he but stay three days, his company They will grow weary of; but if he tarry Ten days together, though the master bear it, The servants grumble. Per. Wherefore have I servants, But to perform me service, not that they Should bear authority o'er me, or hold me Bounden to them?—If what I like they like not, I steer my own course: though 'tis their aversion, Still they must do't, or be it at their peril.— But I will now proceed, as I intended, To get provisions. Pleu. If you're so resolv'd, Pray cater sparingly, at no great cost.— For me, I am content with any thing.— Per. Away now with such antiquated stuff, The ordinary cant of common folks, Who, when they are sat down, and supper's serv'd, Cry,—“What occasion was there for this charge “On our account?—why sure, Sir, you was mad:— “For, look ye, here's enough for half a score.”— With what's provided for them they find fault, And yet they eat. Pal. Faith 'tis their very way.— How shrewd is his discernment! Per. All the while, These self-same gentry, be it e'er so great The plenty set before them, never say,— “Here take this off;—away there with that dish;— “Remove that gammon hence,—it is not wanted;— “Take off that chine;—this conger will be good, “When cold.”—Remove!—Carry away!—Take off!— No, no,—you never hear a word of this From any of them;—but they stretch them forward, And hang with half their bodies o'er the table, Straining to snatch the daintiest bits. Pal. Good soul! How well has he describ'd their scurvy manners! Per. What I have said is scarce an hundredth part Of what I have in store, if leisure serv'd. Pal. Good,—it were fit then we should turn our thoughts Upon our present business.—Mark me now,— Both lend me your attention.—I have need, Periplectomenes, of your assistance; For I have hit upon a pleasant trick Will clip his cock's-comb, shave our captain close, Enable this Philocomasium's lover To bear her off with him. Per. Impart to me The plan of your device. Pal. Impart to me That ring of your's. Per. For what end would you use it? Pal. When I have got it, I will then impart The plan of my device. Per. (giving him the ring) Here—use it, take it. Pal. Take in return from me the plan I've laid. Pleu. We both attend to you with open ears. Pal. My master's such a rake, so fond of women, There never was his equal I believe, Nor ever will be. Per. I believe the same. Pal. He boasts, that in his person he exceeds Ev'n Alexander's self, and that he's followed By all our women here in Ephesus. Per. Needs there much said? I know you do not lie, But am convinc'd 'tis e'en so as you say.— Be brief then, and compendious as you can. Pal. Well, can you find me a smart handsome wench, Buxom in mind and body, full of art? Per. Of what condition?—free by birth, or bond-woman Made free? Pal. 'Tis equal to me, so you find One that lets out herself for hire, and draws Support from prostitution.—She should have A knowing mind;—I speak not of her heart,— For that no woman has. Per. Would you a dame Experienc'd, or a novice? Pal. I would have her As brisk, as roguish, and as young as may be. Per. I have hard by one under my protection Fit for your purpose,—a young courtesan.— But how would you employ her? Pal. Bring her home, And let her be apparell'd like a matron, Her head well drest, her hair bound up with fillets: Let her pretend, that she's your wife;—for so You must instruct her. Pleu. I am at a loss, What road it is you take. Pal. But ye shall know. What maid has she? Per. A rare one. Pal. We have need Of her too.—You must thus instruct them both,— Mistress and maid.—The mistress shall pretend, That she's your wife, and doats upon this captain: And we'll pretend moreover, that she gave Her maid this ring, and that she brought it me To give it to the captain, and I'll seem A go-between in this affair. Per. I hear you,— Don't stun me,—I'm not deaf. Pal. You understand me. I will present our captain with this ring, Tell him 'twas brought and giv'n me from your wife, To win his favour: he's of such a nature, That he'll affect her with a strong desire; A rake-hell!—whose whole study is employ'd In nothing but intrigue. Per. The sun himself, Had you commission'd him to search them out, Could not have found two fitter for the purpose, Than those that I shall furnish.—Courage, man. Pal. 'Tis necessary we should act with care, And with dispatch. [Exit Periplectomenes. SCENE III. PALÆSTRIO and PLEUSIDES. Pal. Now heark me, Pleusides. Pleu. I'm all obedience. Pal. Mind you,—when the captain Comes home, be sure remember not to call Philocomasium by her name. Pleu. What then? Pal. Why, Glycera. Pleu. Oh, the same we late agreed on. Pal. No more:—begone now. Pleu. I'll remember,—but, I pray you, for what purpose is this caution? Pal. I'll tell you, when occasion shall require;— Mean time be quiet.—As He acts his part, You on your side be mindful of your cue. Pleu. I'll in then. Pal. See, you follow your instructions. [Pleusides goes in. Pal. What turmoils I create! what mighty engines I set to work!—Now shall I carry off Our captain's lady, if my band of soldiery Are rightly train'd.—But I will call him forth.— Hola,—Sceledrus,—if you are not busy, Step here.—Palæstrio calls you.—Hoa— SCENE IV. Enter LUCRIO, a Lad. Sceledrus Is not at leisure. Pal. Why? Lucr. He's fast asleep Gulping. Pal. Gulping what? Lucr. Snoring I would say;— But they are both so much alike;—to snore Is as it were to gulp. Pal. What! is Sceledrus Asleep within? Lucr. Not with his nose indeed;— With that he makes an huge noise.—He has taken A cup by stealth: the butler through neglect Left in his way a pitcher-full of Nardine. Pal. Hoa, rascal, you that are the under butler, Hearkye me.— Lucr. What's your pleasure? Pal. How is it, That he's asleep? Lucr. How?—with his eyes, I think. Pal. Sirrah, I do not ask you that.—Come hither.— You are undone, except I know the truth.— You drew him wine? Lucr. Not I. Pal. Do you deny it? Lucr. Yes truly;—for he charg'd me not to tell.— Not I indeed forsooth,—I did not draw him A pitcher of eight pints,—no, nor did he Drink hot wine at his dinner. Pal. Nor did you Drink too. Lucr. The Gods confound me, if I did,— If drink I could. Pal. For why? Lucr. I only sipt,— It was too hot, it burnt my throat. Pal. Well,—some Get glorious drunk, some guzzle meagre stuff.— The cellar's trusted to an honest butler, As well as under-butler! Lucr. You in troth Would do the self-same, if you had the care on't.— Because you cannot copy us, you now envy. Pal. Hoa,—did he never draw him wine before?— Answer me, villain.—And be sure of this,— I give you warning,—if you tell me false, You shall be tortur'd,—rascal! Lucr. So will you Inform against me, hey; and then shall I Be ousted from my battening-post, that you May have an under-butler to your mind, To draw you wine in plenty. Pal. Faith I will not.— Come then, speak boldly to me. Lucr. Then by heavens I never saw him draw one drop of wine:— But thus it was;—he order'd and I drew. Pal. What, did you stoop the cask? Lucr. That's not so easy: Besides, the cellar's very wet and slippery.— Close by the cask a water-pot is plac'd, That holds two pints. Now this was often fill'd,— Ten times a day;—I've seen it quick replenish'd, And emptied all as quickly.—As the pot Mov'd to and fro, the casks would stoop to meet it. Pal. Go, get you in.—Ye play the Bacchanals Both of you in the wine cellar.—I'll fetch My master from the Forum. Lucr. (Aside.) I am ruin'd.— When he comes home, and learns what has been done, He'll have me whipt, because I did not tell him.— I'll e'en take to my heels,—and skulking somewhere Stave off my sufferings to a further day. (Going.) (To the spectators.) I do beseech you, that you will not tell him. Pal. Whither art going? Lucr. I am sent elsewhere, And shall return this instant. Pal. Who has sent you? Lucr. Philocomasium. Pal. Go,—be back directly. Lucr. If there's a dividend, while I'm away, Of a sound beating, do you take my share on't. [Lucrio goes off. SCENE V. PALÆSTRIO alone. So—now I know our lady's drift: the while Sceledrus is asleep, she has sent out Her under-keeper, so that she may pass From our house into this.—I like it well.— But see—Periplectomenes comes yonder, Bringing along, as I commission'd him, A woman of incomparable beauty.— The gods take part with us in our affair.— See how demure she treads! and how becoming Is her apparell!—nothing like an harlot.— This business prospers rarely in our hands. SCENE VI. Enter PERIPLECTOMENES advancing with ACROTELEUTIUM and MILPHIDIPPA, at a distant Part of the Stage. Within have I explain'd this whole affair To you, Acroteleutium, and to you, My Milphidippa;—and if our device Ye comprehend but slightly, I could wish Ye were again instructed in't more throughly; But if sufficiently ye understand it, There's other matter we may rather talk of. Acr. 'Twould be a folly in me, and the height Of ignorance, to undertake a work, Or promise my assistance, if I knew not How to acquit me in the business. Per. Yet 'Tis best to be advised. Acr. Advise an harlot! What that imports, to me is yet a secret. But I do wrong myself, letting my ears Drink your discourse in dull delay.—I've told you, How we may hew this block here of a captain. Per. Two heads are better, as they say, than one.— But many, I have often known, avoid Advice, sooner than find it. Acr. Trust a woman,— If she has any mischief to promote, I warrant, she'll remember;—in that point Her memory is immortal, everlasting:— If any thing is to be done by them Or good or honest,—so it happens, strait They grow forgetful, and they can't remember. Per. Therefore I fear th'event of our proceedings, Seeing the injury ye do the captain, Will be to my advantage. Acr. Never fear:— Whatever good we chance to do, we do Unwittingly.—No harlot but is ready, When mischief is on foot. Per. Your very character.— Come, follow me. Pal. Why don't I go and meet them? (Advancing.) Sir, I am glad to see you.—By my troth She's admirably drest. Per. Well met, Palæstrio,— Most opportunely.—Here they are, the women You bade me bring, and drest as you required. Per. Be one of us.—Palæstrio salutes Acroteleutium. Acr. Prithee, who is this, That calls me so familiar by my name, As if he knew me? Per. He's our master-plotter. Acr. Your servant, master-plotter! Pal. I am your's.— But tell me, has he giv'n you full instructions? Per. I've brought them both well studied in their parts. Pal. Fain would I hear as how; for I'm afraid, Lest ye should err in any point. Per. I've only Retail'd your precepts:—nothing have I added New of myself. Acr. Is it your will forsooth, The captain should be play'd on? Pal. You have said it. Acr. We are prepar'd with cunning and address. Pal. And you must feign yourself His wife. Acr. I shall. Pal. And that you've set your heart upon the captain. Acr. 'Twill so fall out. Pal. And the affair shall seem As carried on betwixt your maid and me.— Acr. Well, surely you may set up for a prophet, Since you divine so rarely what will happen.— Pal. And further—that she brought this ring from you, For me to give the captain in your name. Acr. Right,—you say true. Per. What needs there repetition, When they so well remember? Acr. It is best.— For think you this, my patron: When the ship-wright, If he has skill, has once laid down the keel, Exact to line and measure, it is easy To build the ship thus laid and tightly founded.— Our keel's already laid and tightly founded;— Our workmen are at hand,—procur'd by me, By you,—and not unskilful: now if he, Who furnishes the timber, don't retard us, I know our skill,—our ship will soon be ready. Pal. Pray, do you know my master? Acr. It is strange, That you should ask me.—What! must I not know The scorn of every one? an empty Braggard, A wenching, perfum'd, frizzle-pated fellow. Pal. And does he know you too? Acr. He never saw me;— How should he know me then, or who I am? Pal. That's rare;—our project will succeed most rarely. Acr. Give me the man, be quiet for the rest; And if I do not play him such a game,— Lay the whole blame on me. Per. Well, go you in then. Be mindful of your business. Acr. Never fear us. Pal. Do you conduct them in, Sir.—I'll go meet My master at the Forum, with this ring Present him, say 'twas giv'n me from your wife, And that she's dying for him.—When that we Return, let Milphidippa come to us, As though she were dispatch'd to me in private. Per. We'll do so—never fear us. Pal. You'll take care then. I'll bring him hither loaded like a pack-ass. Per. Now luck go with you! manage well this business. (To Acr.) But should it be effected, that my guest Shall gain the captain's mistress, and depart For Athens with her,—should our trick succeed, What present must I make you? Acr. You shall promise To love no other woman but myself. Pal. Most sweetly said. Acr. I trust we shall succeed. When all our cunning is combin'd together, I have no fear, that we shall be o'er-match'd In subtlety and fraud. Per. Then let us in, And weigh our counsels deeply in our thoughts, That we may act with caution, lest the captain, When he returns, in ought should find us tripping. Acr. Come, come, you but delay us with your prattle. [Periplectomenes goes in with the women, and Palæstrio goes off. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. Enter PYRGOPOLINICES and PALÆSTRIO. PYRGOPOLINICES. It is a pleasure, whatsoe'er you do, If fairly it succeed, and to your mind.— I have dispatch'd my parasite to-day To king Seleucus, to conduct the troops That I have levied to defend his kingdom, While I indulge in leisure and repose. Pal. Think rather of your own concerns, nor heed Seleucus.—What a fair and new proposal Is offer'd to you through my mediation! Pyrg. Well then,—all other matters I postpone, And lend attention to thee.—Speak;—my ears I do surrender up to thy disposal. Pal. Look round, lest some one catch our conversation: For I was order'd to transact this business In private with you. Pyrg. There is no one near us. Pal. First, take this pledge of love. (giving a ring. Pyrg. Ha! what is this? Whence comes it? Pal. From a fair and buxom dame; One that adores you, doats upon your beauty.— I had it of her maid to bring to you. Pyrg. What is she?—Is she gentle by her birth, Or once a bond-woman, but since made free? Pal. Ah, do you think, that I would dare to play The go-between for one that was a slave, Knowing so many ladies wooe you to them. Pyrg. Is she a wife, or widow? Pal. Wife, and widow. Pyrg. How is it possible she can be both,— Widow and wife? Pal. Because she's young, and married To an old fellow. Pyrg. Well—so much the better. Pal. Then such a person! Pyrg. See thou liest not, sirrah. Pal. O she alone is worthy of your charms! Pyrg. Thou mak'st her out indeed a beauty.—But Who is she? Pal. She's the wife of this old fellow Periplectomenes, our neighbour here. She's dying for you, and about to leave him: The dotard she detests, and order'd me To beg you would vouchsafe your favour to her. Pyrg. Well, well then,—I'm content,—if she desire it. Pal. If she desire it! Pyrg. How shall we dispose Of her I have at home, that other wench? Pal. E'en bid her to be gone, where-e'er she lifts; For,—do you know?—her mother and twin-sister Are come to Ephesus to fetch her home. Pyrg. How say you?—is the mother come to Ephesus? Pal. They told me, that should know. Pyrg. By Hercules A charming opportunity to turn The baggage out of doors. Pal. But would you do The thing that's handsome? Pyrg. What would'st thou advise? Pal. Have you a mind forthwith to send her packing With a good grace? Pyrg. I have,—tis my desire. Pal. Then this you ought to do.—You have enough Of riches:—bid her take by way of present The cloaths and trinkets you supplied her with, To carry with her wheresoe'er she pleases. Pyrg. It likes me what thou say'st. But hold,—suppose I lose Her, and that other change her mind. Pal. Ah,—sure you are in jest.—She change her mind? What she,—who loves you, as she loves her eyes? Pyrg. By Venus am I favour'd. Pal. Hist!—the door Is opening.—Step aside this way, and hide you.— This is her fly-boat, that is coming forth, Her go-between. Pyrg. What mean'st thou by her fly-boat? Pal. It is her maid, that's coming forth,—the same, That brought the ring I gave you. Pyrg. By my troth A likely wench. Pal. Oh, she is monkey-faced,— Owl-visaged,—in comparison to th'other.— Mark, how she hunts round with her eyes, and spreads Her ears, like toils, to catch each passing sound! [They stand aloof. SCENE II. Enter MILPHIDIPPA. Is this the Circus, here before the house, Where I must hold my sports?—I'll make pretence As though I did not see them, did not know That they are here. Pyrg. Hush!—let us hearken, if She'll mention ought of me. Mil. Is no one near? No meddler, that minds others businesses More than his own? no lounger on the watch To see what I'm about? no dieter At his own cost, who's not in search for supper?— I am afraid, lest any such as these Stand in the way, and be an hindrance, when My mistress comes,—poor soul! who doats upon This all enchanting, this too handsome man, This gallant captain Pyrgopolinices. Pyrg. She doats upon me too; commends my beauty.— 'Tis a clean-spoken wench,—she needs no ashes. Pal. What do you mean? Pyrg. To scour her words:—she speaks Most daintily; and she's a dainty girl.— Faith I begin to feel some liking for her. Pal. What! ere you have set eyes upon the other? Pyrg. I've faith in what I see.—By her discourse She forces me to love her. Pal. On my soul You must not love her: she's betroth'd to me: If you the mistress wed, I take the maid. Pyrg. Why art thou backward then in speaking to her? Pal. True,—come along. Pyrg. I lacquey you at heels. Mil. O that I could but meet him, for whose sake I am come forth here! Pal. (Advancing towards her.) You shall have your wish: Take courage: fear not:—there's a certain person Knows where he is, whom you are looking for. Milp. Who's that I hear? Pal. The partner of your secrets,— Your fellow-counsellor. Mil. I don't conceal then What I conceal. Pal. Nay, but you do conceal Ev'n what you don't conceal. Mil. How make you that out? Pal. From the untrusty you conceal your secrets: But I am of a firm unshaken faith. Mil. Give me a token, if you're of the Bacchæ. Pal. A certain lady loves a certain gentleman. Mil. In troth, and so do many. Pal. But not many, That send them presents, and from off their fingers. Mil. Oh, now I know:—you've made the matter plain.— Is no one near? Pal. There is, or there is not. Mil. I want to talk with you alone in private. Pal. Will it be short or long you have to say? Mil. Three words. Pal. (To Pyrg.) I will return to you this instant. Pyrg. What?—shall I stand here, I who am renown'd For my exploits and beauty, but a moment Idle and unemploy'd? Pal. Content yourself,— Stay here:—it is your service I'm upon. Pyrg. I'm tortur'd with impatience. Pal. Soft and fair: You know, Sir; in commodities of this kind We're wont to deal thus. Pyrg. Well then, as it suits thee. Pal. (Aside.) No stone can be more senseless than this lack-wit. (To Pyrg.) I'll soon return to you.—(To Milph.) What would you with me? Mil. To take of you directions as before. Pal. Say, she is dying for him. Mil. That I know. Pal. Commend his person, and extoll his bravery. Mil. For that I'm arm'd at all points, as I shew'd you. Pal. The rest you'll manage:—you have got your cue. Pyrg. Prithee allow me some share in the business.— (To Pal.) Sirrah, come here this instant. Pal. Here I am:— Command me,—what's your will? Pyrg. What says she to thee? Pal. She says her mistress takes on grievously, Poor soul! and sore afflicts herself with crying, Because you are not with her:—for that reason She was dispatch'd to you. Pyrg. Bid her approach. Pal. But know you how to act now?—Bear yourself Disdainfully, as though you like it not; And rate me soundly, that I dare presume To stale you to the vulgar. Pyrg. I'll remember, And follow thy instructions. Pal. Please you, I Should call her? Pyrg. If she wants me, let her come. Pal. Come hither, woman, if you want my master. Mil. (Advancing.) Save you, Prince Prettiman! Pyrg. Ha!—who could tell her, That was my name?—Heav'n grant you all you wish! Mil. To pass life with you, is— Pyrg. You wish too much. Mil. Myself I mean not, but my mistress, who Is dying for you. Pyrg. Many wish the same, But to no end. Mil. In sooth I wonder not, That you should put such value on yourself, A gentleman so handsome! so renown'd For beauty, valour, and for bright atchievements! Lives there, who more deserves the name of man? Pal. (Aside.) Then there is nothing human:—by my faith I think there's more humanity in a vulture. Pyrg. Now will I make myself of consequence, Since she's so lavish of her commendations.— Pal. Look at the block-head, how he puffs and swells!— Will you not answer her, good Sir?—she comes A suiter from the lady,— Pyrg. From what lady? There are so many ladies court my favour, I can't remember them. Mil. I come from her, Who to adorn your fingers strips her own: That ring I brought from her, and gave your servant. Pyrg. Well, woman, what is't you would have? explain. Mil. That you would not disdain her who adores you, Who lives but in your life, whose hope is placed In you alone, whether she live or dye. Pal. What's her desire? Mil. To talk with, and embrace you: If you refuse to comfort her, she'll perish.— Come, my Achilles,—grant what I request, And save this fair one,—call forth your benevolence, Stormer of cities, conqueror of kings! Pyrg. O how vexatious this!—How often, rascal, Have I forbade you thus to make me common? Pal. Woman, d'ye hear?—I told you this before, And now repeat it,—you must pay him well. Mil. We'll give him any price he asks. Pal. A talent Of gold:—he'll take no less of any one. Mil. Nay, that indeed now is too cheap. Pyrg. In me Did avarice never spring: I'm rich enough: I have of gold more than a thousand measures In Philippeans. Pal. Then, besides this treasure, He has of silver, I'll not call them piles, But mountains;—Ætna's self is not so high. Mil. (To Pal. aside.) Thou monstrous fibber! Pal. (To Milph.) How I play him off! Mil. And I too,—how I gull the fool! Pal. Most rarely. Mil. Pray you, sweet Sir, dismiss me out of hand. Pal. Make her some answer,—that you will, or will not. Why give the lady so much pain, that never Deserv'd ill of you? Pyrg. Well then,—bid her come To me in person,—tell her I will do All she desires. Mil. You act as it behoves you, Suiting your will to her's,— Pal. He's a sweet soul.— Mil. And that you have not scorn'd me poor petitioner, But suffer'd me to win your fair consent.— (Aside to Pal.) So—how I tickle him! Pal. By heav'ns I can't Restrain myself from laughing: therefore have I Turn'd away from you. Pyrg. O thou know'st not, wench, How much I honour her. Mil. I know, and will Acquaint her with it. Pal. He might have sold his favours Much dearer to another. Mil. I believe you. Pal. Those, that by him are happy mothers made, Bring forth sheer warriours; and his children live Eight hundred years. Mil. Fye on you for a fibber. Pyrg. Nay, but they live, I say, a thousand years, Reckoning from age to age. Pal. I spoke within bounds, Fearing to seem a lyar to her face. Mil. (Aside.) I burst, I dye.—How many years must he Himself live, when his children live so long? Pyrg. Wench, I was born upon the day next that, When Jove was born of Ops. Pal. O had his birth Preceeded Jove's one day, he had possess'd The kingdom of the skies. Mil. Enough, sweet souls: Let me be gone. Pal. Why don't you go then, since You have your answer? Mil. I will go and bring My mistress here.—Would you ought further with me? Pyrg. O may I ne'er be fairer than I am! My beauty's such a plague to me. Pal. Why stay you? Why don't you go? (Aside to Mil.) Mil. I'm gone. Pal. And hearkye.—Tell her All that has past. Mil. Her heart will leap within her. Pal. And tell Philocomasium, if she's yonder, She must come home, for that the captain's here. Mil. She's yonder with my mistress, slily hearkening Our conversation. Pal. 'Tis well done:—they'll learn The better how to act from having heard us. Mil. You hinder me. Pal. I leave you, I don't hinder you, Nor do I touch you, nor—I say no more. Pyrg. Bid her come forth to us with instant speed: All other matters we'll postpone to this. [Milphidippa goes in. SCENE III. PYRGOPOLINICES and PALÆSTRIO. PYRGOPOLINICES. Palæstria, what would'st thou advise me now To do about my mistress? for by no means Can I receive this here into my house, Till I've dismiss'd the other. Pal. Why consult Me what you ought to do? I've told you, how It may be carried with all gentleness. Her trinkets, baubles, all her women's geer, With which you furnish'd her, e'en let her have, Take, carry off: and tell her, 'tis high time She should go home again; tell her, her mother And her twin-sister are arriv'd, with whom She may depart. Pyrg. How know'st thou, they are come? Pal. I saw her sister here with my own eyes. Pyrg. What, have they met? Pal. They have. Pyrg. How does she look? Is she a brave piece? Pal. You would have them all. Pyrg. Where was her mother, did the sister say? Pal. The master of the ship, that brought them, told me, She had an inflammation in her eyes, And was on board: He's lodg'd too at next door. Pyrg. But to the point. Pal. Well. Pyrg. What would'st thou advise? I'd have thee talk to her upon the subject: 'Twill come better from thee. Pal. Nay, rather go Yourself; yourself transact your own concerns. Tell her, you needs must marry,—you're persuaded By your relations, urg'd to't by your friends. Pyrg. And dost thou think so? Pal. How can I think other? Pyrg. I'll in then, and do thou mean time keep watch Before the house, that thou mayst call me out, When th'other comes. Pal. Mind what you do. Pyrg. I shall. For, if she go not of her own accord, I'll turn her out by force. Pal. No, do not so, But rather let her go with a good grace: Give her the things I mention'd; let her take Her trinkets, and her geer. Pyrg. With all my heart. Pal. You'll easily, I think, prevail with her.— But get you in, don't loiter.— Pyrg. I obey you. [Pyrgopolinices goes in. Pal. (To the spectators.) Doth he appear ought chang'd from what I told you A while ago he was, this wenching captain?— Now do I want Acroteleutium To come here, and her maid, and Pleusides.— O Jupiter! how much Commodity Befriends me on all sides!—for those I wish'd To see, are coming hither from our neighbour's. SCENE IV. Enter ACROTELEUTIUM, MILPHIDIPPA, and PLEUSIDES. ACROTELEUTIUM. Follow me,—at the same time look around, Lest any one observe us. Mil. No one see I, Save him that we would meet. Pal. As I would you. Mil. Our architect! how fare you? Pal. I your architect? Ah— Mil. How now? Pal. I'm not worthy, if compar'd With you, to stick a peg into a wall. Acr. No to be sure! Pal. O she's a clever jade, When mischief's set on foot. How charmingly She smooth'd our captain o'er! Acr. But not sufficient. Pal. Courage—our business prospers to our wish, If you continue but to lend assistance. For know, the captain is himself gone in To ask his mistress, that she would depart For Athens with her sister and her mother. Acr. Good! very good! Pal. Nay more,—he gives her all The cloaths, and trinkets, which he had provided, So she be gone:—myself advis'd him to it. Pleu. That's easily agreed, if she is willing, And he desire it too. Pal. Do you not know, When from the bottom of a well you've mounted Up to the top, then there's the greatest danger, Lest from the brink you topple back again? Now our affair stands tottering, as it were, Upon the brink and summit of the well; For should the captain chance to smell us out, We shall get nothing from him:—wherefore now We need erect our batteries. Pleu. We have got Sufficient store of timber for that purpose;— Three women,—you yourself make a fourth person, And I a fifth,—and our old host a sixth. Pal. What heaps of stratagems we've fell'd already! No town whatever could hold out against us, If ye but lend assistance. Acr. For that purpose Are we come out to you to know your pleasure. Pal. 'Tis sweetly done in you.—Then this I order As your department. (To Acr.) Acr. You're our general,— Command me what you will, that's in my power. Pal. I'd have you play this captain off most finely. Acr. Good—your command's a pleasure. Pal. Know you how? Acr. To wit, that I should feign myself distracted With love for him. Pal. The thing. Acr. And for that love I have foregone my marriage here, much longing To match with him. Pal. Right, you proceed in order. Only this one thing,—you must also say, This house is settled on you for your dowry, And that the old man after your divorce Had quitted it,—lest bye and bye the captain Should fear to enter in another's house. Acr. Well you advise me. Pal. But when he appears, I'd have you stand aloof, and seem as though You scorn'd your beauty in compare with his, And was awe-struck with his vast opulence: Be sure you praise his loveliness of mein, His air, his face, his beauty altogether.— Are you enough instructed? Acr. I am perfect. Will it suffice, if I produce my work So finish'd, that you shall not find a fault? Pal. I am content. (to Pleu.) Now hearken in your turn What I command you. Pleu. Speak. Pal. When this is done, As soon as she has enter'd, come you hither Accoutred like the master of a ship, With broad-brim'd hat and of an russet grey, And hold a woollen compress 'fore your eyes; Have on a short cloak, of an russet grey too, (For that's your seaman's colour) fasten it On your left shoulder, your right arm stuck out; And tye a belt about your waist:—thus drest, Pretend yourself the master of a ship.— Your good old host here can equip you throughly, For he has fishermen. Pleu. When thus accoutred, What must I do? Pal. Come here, and call upon Philocomasium in her mother's name; Tell her, if now she would return to Athens, She must with you directly to the port, And order to be carried to the ship, If any thing she has to put on board; Say bluntly, if she did not go that instant, You must weigh anchor, for the wind was fair. Pleu. I like your picture well enough.—Proceed. Pal. Our gull will strait exhort her to be gone, Bid her make haste, nor let her mother wait. Pleu. You've an extensive genius. Pal. I will tell her To ask my master, that he'd let me carry Her baggage to the port; when he at once Will bid me to attend her.—What do I? I'll tell you,—I am off with you for Athens. Pleu. And when you come there, I'll not let you serve Three days, before you shall be free. Pal. Then go, And strait equip you. Pleu. Any thing besides? Pal. Only—remember. Pleu. I am gone. [Pleusides goes in. Pal. (To the Women.) And you Go, get you in directly, for I know He will come out this instant. Acr. Your commands Must be obey'd. Pal. Come, prithee now be gone. [The Women go in. See—the door opens opportunely.—Out He comes, quite joyous:—he has gain'd his suit. Poor wretch! he longs for what he'll ne'er possess. SCENE V. Enter PYRGOPOLINICES. Philocomasium now at length has granted What I implor'd by friendship and by favour. Pal. What kept you, Sir, within so long a time? Pyrg. O I was never sensible till now, How much the damsel doated on me. Pal. Why? Pyrg. So many words she made! so slow my progress! But at the last I won her fair consent.— I gave her all she wish'd, and all she ask'd;— With thee too I presented her. Pal. What! me too?— How can I live without you? Pyrg. Prithee, man, Be of good heart; I'll also make thee free. I striv'd, if possibly by any means I could prevail upon her to depart Without her taking you along: but she Constrain'd me. Pal. In the Gods I'll place my hope, And last in you:—yet though 'tis bitter to me, Seeing that I shall lose so good a master, I have at least this pleasure, that the power Of your resistless beauty has procur'd you This neighbour lady through my mediation. Pyrg. Needs there more said?—I'll give thee liberty, And wealth besides, if thou canst win her for me. Pal. I'll win her. Pyrg. But I long. Pal. Hold—softly, Sir: Be moderate in your love, and not so hot.— But here's the lady,—see, she's coming forth. SCENE VI. Enter ACROTELEUTIUM and MILPHIDIPPA. MILPHIDIPPA. Look, mistress, there's the captain. Acr. Ha!—Where is he? Mil. There, to the left. Acr. I see him. Mil. Only cast A side glance at him, that he mayn't perceive We see him. Acr. So—I view him.—On my troth Now is the time to prove our utmost art. Mil. You must begin. Acr. (Aloud.) Pray was you with him?— (to Mil. aside) Don't Be sparing of your voice, but let him hear you. Mil. (Aloud.) I talk'd with him at ease, and at my leisure, And as I lik'd, and at my own discretion, And as I would. Pyrg. So—hear'st thou what she says? Pal. I hear.—How pleas'd she is, that she approach'd you! Acr. O happy wench! Pyrg. How she's enamour'd of me! Pal. You merit it. Acr. 'Tis strange, what you relate,— That you approach'd him, and prevail'd: they say, He never is address'd but by dispatches, Or by ambassadours, all like a monarch. Mil. True, 'twas with difficulty I procured An audience to prefer my suit. Pal. How great Your fame among the women! Pyr. I must bear it, Since Venus wills it so. Acr. My grateful thanks I pay to Venus, and beseech the goddess, That I may win his favour whom I doat on, That he may gentle prove, nor take amiss What I desire. Mil. I hope it will be so; Though many ladies seek his love: but he Disdains them, holds himself estrang'd to all, Save you alone. Acr. Therefore this fear torments me, That, when he sees me, since he's so disdainful, His eyes will change his sentiments, his own Bright beauty make him scorn my homelier form. Mil. Be of good heart;—he will not do it. Pyrg. How She flights herself! Acr. I fear too, your account Has set me off too well.— Mil. I've taken care, That you shall shew still fairer than you stand In his opinion. Acr. Verily if he will not Take me for wife, I will embrace his knees, Implore, beseech him:—If I don't prevail, Why then by my own hand I'll dye:—I know, I cannot live without him. Pyrg. I must save her,— I must prevent her death.—Shall I go to her?— Pal. No, by no means.—You'll make yourself too cheap, To give yourself so lavishly away: First let her come to you, let her seek you, Express her fond desire and expectation. What—would you lose that glory which you have? For never did it happen but to two,— You and the Lesbian Phaon,—to be lov'd So desperately. Acr. I'll go in to him.— You, Milphidippa, go, and call him forth. Mil. Let's rather wait, till some one shall come out. Acr. I cannot stay, but I must in. Mil. The door Is shut. Acr. I'll break it open. Mil. You are mad. Acr. If he has ever lov'd, or if he owns An understanding equal to his beauty, Whatever I shall rashly do through love, I know he will have mercy, and forgive me. Pal. Poor soul, she's over head and ears in love! Pyrg. 'Tis mutual in us. Pal. Hush,—she'll hear you else. Mil. Why stand you stupified?—why don't you knock? Acr. Because he's not within here, whom I want. Mil. How do you know? Acr. I know it:—if he were, My nose would scent him. Pyrg. She divines:—because She loves me, Venus has bestow'd upon her The gift of prophecy. Acr. I know not where He is, whose sight I long for,—but I know, He's not far off;—I smell him. Pal. Why she sees More with her nose than eyes. Pyrg. She's blind with love. Acr. Prithee support me,— Mil. Why? Acr. —Or I shall fall. Mil. Why so? Acr. Because I cannot stand,—my spirits Are sunk so through my eyes. Mil. What! have you seen The captain? Arc. Yes. Mil. I see him not,—where is he? Acr. Verily you would see him, if you lov'd. Mil. Nay, by my troth you cannot love him more Than I do,—with your leave. Pal. Well,—ev'ry woman, Soon as she sees you, is in love with you. Pyrg. I know not, whether I have told you:—I Am Venus' grand-son. Acr. Prithee, Milphidippa, Go and hold converse with him. Pyrg. How I awe her! Pal. She's coming t'wards us. Mil. (Advancing.) I would speak with you. Pyrg. And we with you. Mil. I've brought my mistress here, As you commanded me. Pyrg. I see her. Mil. Well then, Bid her approach. Pyrg. I have prevail'd upon My heart, at thy entreaty, not to loath her Like others of her sex. Mil. She'd not be able To speak a word, were she to come but near you. E'en while she's looking at you, by her eyes She's tongue-tied. Pyrg. Her disorder I must cure. Mil. See, how she trembles! how she's struck with fear, Since she beheld you! Pyrg. Warriors do the same, No wonder then a woman.—But what is it, She'd have me do? Mil. Come home to her: with you She longs to live, with you to pass her days. Pyrg. What! I come home to her, when she is married?— Her husband's to be dreaded. Mil. For your sake She turn'd her husband out. Pyrg. How could she do it? Mil. Because the house is her's, seeing 'twas settled Upon her for her dowry. Pyrg. Is it so? Mil. 'Tis so, by heav'ns. Pyrg. Then tell her to go home:— I'll come to her this instant. Mil. Do not keep her In expectation; for 'twill vex her soul. Pyrg. In sooth I will not.—Go then. Mil. We are gone. [Acroteleutium and Milphidippa go in. Pyrg. What do I see? Pal. What see you? Pyrg. Some one comes, I know not who, drest in a sailor's habit. Pal. Perhaps he wants us.—Oh, it is the pilot. Pyrg. He comes forsooth to fetch our wench. Pal. I think so. SCENE VII. Enter PLEUSIDES at a distance, in a Sailor's habit. Were I not sensible, that other men In other ways have done as vile for love, I should be more asham'd to wear this garb On the account of love: but I have learn'd, That many have committed many actions Base, and estrang'd from good and right, in love:— I speak not of Achilles, how he suffer'd His comrades to be slain, and all for love.— But see Palæstrio standing with the captain;— And I must change the fashion of my phrase.— Sure woman's born of tardiness itself; For ev'ry other, though the same delay, Seems less delay than that, which woman makes:— They do it, one would fancy, all from custom.— I'm come to call upon Philocomasium:— And here's the door, I'll knock.—Hoa—who's within there? Pal. How now, my lad?—what say you?—why d'ye knock here? Pleu. I want Philocomasium:—from her mother I'm come:—if she's for going, let her come then.— She stays us all; and we would fain weigh anchor. Pyrg. All is in readiness, and long has been so.— Hearkye, Palæstrio, let her take her trinkets, Her gold, apparell, all things valuable: Take with you some assistants, that may help you To bear them to the ship:—they are all pack'd, All that I've giv'n her to take off. Pal. I go. Pleu. Prithee now, do make haste. Pyrg. He will not tarry. [Palæstrio goes in. Pyrg. (To Pleu. who holds up a compress to his eye.) Hey, what's the matter? prithee, what hast thou Done with thine eye? Pleu. Why, ha'n't I got my eye? Pyrg. The left I mean. Pleu. I'll tell you:—I less use This eye, by reason of my occupation: Were't not for that, I should use both alike.— But they too long detain me. Pyrg. Here they come. SCENE VII. Enter PALÆSTRIO and PHILOCOMASIUM. PALÆSTRIO, (To Phil.) Pray, will you never make an end of weeping? Phil. How can I chuse but weep?—I'm going hence, Where I have pass'd my days with so much pleasure. Pal. See you the man there, who is come to you From your twin-sister and your mother? Phil. Ah, I see him. Pyrg. Hearkye me, Palæstrio. Pal. What's Your pleasure? Pyrg. You will order all her things To be brought out. Pleu. Philocomasium, Your servant. Phil. Your's. Pleu. Your mother and your sister Bade me to give their love and blessing to you. Phil. Heav'ns bless them both! Pleu. They pray you to make haste, That we may set sail, while the wind is fair: Your mother, if her eyes had not been bad, Had come along with me. Phil. I'll go then, though 'Tis with regret: but duty does compell me. Pleu. You're wise now. Pyrg. If she had not been with me, She to this day had liv'd in ignorance. Phil. O it is torture this,—to be estrang'd From such a man as you! for you can make A woman all accomplish'd; and because I liv'd with you, I had a lofty spirit:— But now that greatness I shall lose for ever. (weeping.) Pyrg. She weeps excessively. Phil. I cannot help it, While that I look upon you. Pal. Come,—take heart.— Ah me! and I feel what afflicts me too.— I nothing wonder, 'twas a pleasure to you To live with him: his beauteous form, his manners, His bravery have attach'd your soul unto him.— I too, his servant, weep, when I look on him, To think we shall be parted. Phil. I beseech you, Let me embrace you once, before I go. Pyrg. I give permission. Phil. (Embracing him.) O my eyes! my soul! (Upon quitting him she seems ready to swoon.) Pal. (Taking hold of her.) For heaven's sake support her, or she'll fall. Pyrg. Ha! what's the matter? Pal. Soon as she had left you, Poor soul! she fell into a fit. Pyrg. (To his attendants.) Run in, And bring some water quick. Pal. I want no water. Pyrg. Why? Pal. I had rather—Don't you interpose, (Stopping the Captain from going to Phil.) I pray you, till her senses are restor'd. Pyrg. (Observing Pleu. who holds Phil. in his arms.) They have their heads methinks too closely join'd:— I like it not:—their lips seem glued together. Pleu. How sharp is her disorder!—I was trying, Whether she breath'd or not. Pyrg. He should have put His ear then to her mouth. Pleu. (To Pyrg.) If you had rather, I'll leave them both. Pyrg. No.—(To Pal.) Let him take you with him. Pal. Ah me! I cannot chuse but weep. Pyrg. (To the servants within.) Bring out The things, that I have giv'n her. Pal. Houshold God! I now salute you, ere I do depart:— My fellow-servants, male and female, all Farewell! may happiness and health attend you! And let me have your pray'rs, though absent from you. Pyrg. Come, come, be of good heart, Palæstrio. Pal. Oh, I cannot chuse but weep, since I must leave you. Pyrg. Bear it with patience. Pal. O too well I know What cause I have to grieve. Phil. (Seeming to recover.) Ha! how is this?— Who are these people?—what do I behold?— Hail, light! Pleu. Are you recover'd? Phil. I beseech you, What man is't I embrace?—I'm lost,—I'm gone— Am I myself? Pleu. (In a low voice.) Fear nothing, my delight. Pyrg. What's all this? Pal. Oh, Sir, she had lost her senses. (Aside) I fear, our plot will be at length discover'd. Pyrg. What say'st thou? Pal. That will turn to your discredit, When they shall see us through the city bear This load of luggage. Pyrg. Of my own I've given, Not theirs:—I care not what they say:—Away then, Go—and the favour of the Gods attend you! Pal. 'Tis for your sake I speak it. Pyrg. I believe thee. Pal. Farewell! Pyrg. Farewell to thee! Pal. (To Pleu. and Phil.) Haste on before,— I'll overtake you presently:—I've yet A word or two to say unto my master. [Pleusides and Philocomasium go off. SCENE VIII. PALÆSTRIO and PYRGOPOLINICES. PALÆSTRIO. Though in your estimation you have ever Held other slaves more faithful than myself, I owe you many thanks for all your favours; And, if it were your will, I'd rather be A slave to you than freed-man to another. Pyrg. Pluck up thy courage, man. Pal. Ah! woe is me, When I reflect my manners must be chang'd,— That I must learn the womanish, and forget The military. Pyrg. See thou mind thy duty. Pal. I cannot,—I have lost all inclination. Pyrg. Go, follow them,—don't loiter. Pal. Fare you well. Pyrg. The same to thee. Pal. I pray you to remember,— If haply I am freed, I'll send you notice, That you may not desert me. Pyrg. 'Tis not in me. Pal. Think too on my fidelity towards you.— If you do that, you then at length will know The difference 'twixt a bad and honest servant. Pyrg. I know, and I have tried thee oft before, But more to-day than ever. Pal. You will know, And you shall find it still more true hereafter. Pyrg. I hardly can refrain from bidding you To stay. Pal. Ah, have a care, Sir—don't do that.— They'll say you are a lyar, void of truth, And without faith.—Well, sure it must be own'd, All servants I exceed in honesty;— For if I thought you could with honour do it, I would persuade you;—but it cannot be:— Ah, have a care you don't.— Pyrg. I'll be content, Whatever happen,—go. Pal. Then fare you well. Pyrg. 'Twere better, thou should'st go. Pal. Once more—farewell. [Palæstrio goes off. Pyrg. (Alone.) I've always look'd upon him until now As a most villainous rascal; but I find, The fellow's trusty to me.—On reflection, I have done foolishly to part with him.— I'll in now to my love here.—But I hear The door go. SCENE IX. Enter a LAD, speaking to some within. Say no more,—I know my office:— I warrant you, I find him out of hand:— Where'er he be, I'll search him out:—I'll not Be sparing of my pains. Pyrg. 'Tis me he seeks.— I'll meet the lad. Lad. Oh, I was looking for you. Save you, sweet gentleman, whom fair Occasion Loads with her best gifts; and two Deities Do chiefly favour. Pyrg. What two? Lad. Mars and Venus. Pyrg. A sprightly boy! Lad. My lady, Sir, intreats, That you would enter:—she is waiting for you, Dying with expectation.—O relieve Her love-sick soul.—Why stay?—why don't you enter? Pyrg. I go. [Pyrgopolinices goes in. Lad. So—he's entangled in the toils:— The snare is spread:—th'old gentleman stands ready To fasten on the letcher, who forsooth So proud is of his beauty, that the fool Think ev'ry woman is in love with him, Who sees him.—He's the scorn and detestation Of men as well as women.—Hark—I hear The uproar is begun within already:— Now will I in, and mingle in the tumult. The End of the Fourth Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Enter PERIPLECTOMENES with CARIO a Cook, and other Servants, dragging PYRGOPOLINICES. PERIPLECTOMENES. Bring him along;—or, if he will not follow, Drag him out neck and heels, up with him, hoist him Betwixt the earth and sky; cut him to pieces. Pyrg. Periplectomenes! I do beseech you— Per. In vain you do beseech me.—Cario! See Your knife is sharp. Car. It longs to rip his belly. I'll hang his chitterlings about his neck, As children carry baubles. Pyrg. I am done for! Car. Hold, you cry out before you're hurt.—Now, now Shall I have at him? Per. Let him first be cudgell'd. Car. Aye, lustily. Per. How durst you to attempt Another's wife? Pyrg. As I do hope for mercy, She made the first advances. Per. It's a lye.— Lay on him. (They are going to strike him.) Pyrg. Stay, and let me tell you— Per. Why Don't you fall on? Pyrg. Will you not let me speak? Per. Speak. Pyrg. I was courted to come hither. Per. Ha!— How durst you?—There,—take this. (Beating him.) Pyrg. Oh!—good Sir!—Oh! I have enough—I pray you— Car. Shall I slice him? Per. Whene'er you will.—Come, stretch him out, spread out His pinions. Pyrg. Hear me, I beseech you— Per. Speak, Ere yet we make you nothing. Pyrg. I believ'd, That she was husbandless; and so the maid, Her pimp, informed me. Per. If we let you go, Swear, you will not avenge you upon any one, For that you have been, or you shall be beaten,— Grandson of Venus! Pyrg. Both by her and Mars I swear, I'll not avenge me upon any one, For that I have been, or I shall be beaten; But think it is my due:—should you proceed To further outrage, I am justly punish'd. Per. What if you fail to do so? Pyrg. Never more May I be trusted or in word or deed! Car. E'en let him have another drubbing;—then I think you may dismiss him. Pyrg. Blessings on you, For taking thus my part! Car. You'll give us therefore A golden Mina. Pyrg. How!—on what account? Car. Because we let you off unmaim'd and whole, Grandson of Venus! On no other terms Wilt thou escape; don't flatter thee.— Pyrg. I'll give it. Car. 'Tis the best way.—As for your cloaths, and sword, Don't hope to have them back.—Suppose I gave him Another drubbing, e'er you let him go. Pyrg. O I beseech you,—ye have made me tame Already with your cudgels,—pray now. Per. Loose him. Pyrg. I thank you. Per. If I catch you poaching here Henceforth, I'll send you back disqualified. Pyrg. I'll give you leave. Per. Come, Cario, we'll go in. [Periplectomenes, Cario, and Servants, go in. Pyrg. I see some of my fellows coming hither. SCENE II. Enter SCELEDRUS, and other Servants. Pyrg. Philocomasium,—tell me, is she off? Scel. Aye, master, long ago. Pyrg. Ah me! Scel. You'd have More cause to cry Ah me! if you but knew What I know.—He there with the woollen compress Before his eye, he was no sailor. Pyrg. How! Who was he then? Scel. Philocomasium's lover.— Pyrg. How dost thou know? Scel. I know.—No sooner were they Without the town's gate than they fell to slobbering And hugging one another. Pyrg. Wretched fool! I see at length I have been sweetly gull'd.— That rascal of a fellow, that Palæstrio, 'Tis he has lured me into this vile snare.— And yet I think it right.—If other letchers Were serv'd like me, their number would decrease: They would stand more in awe, and give their minds Less to intrigue.—We'll in now.—Clap your hands.
