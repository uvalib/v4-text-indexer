      <field name="fulltext">ACT I Scene I A silent wintry night on the seashore of Smyrna; at the back the dark flow of the sea. Rabbis stand together in their dark turbans; at a little distance Abraham Rubio squats on the sand. Rabbis (speaking among themselves). The sea is cold. The sea is very cold. The sea is starry. Like wounds upon the sea are the large stars. Rubio. And our young Rabbi is down in the winter-sea—cold as death; if this bath is purification, Abraham Rubio will be unclean till the day of the promise. How Sabbataï must shiver! Rabbis (among themselves). Hush, hush, the stars are shivering as they shine, Hush, we are shivering. It is very cold. It is cold, and yet the stars are gay at heart. Do you not feel them gay, as maidens shake On the verges of a dance, on the shores of music, That has not touched their ears to stir their feet? We are waiting, and the sea and stars are waiting, The Heavens, the Earth, the people of our God, Who made the Heavens and Earth and chose our tribes. We wait—O God, how long we wait—we wait! Primo. Why should ye hope this dreamy Cabalist, This self-tormentor, with the ardent lips, And eyes wrapped in their secrecy as clearly As summer's crystal blueness, will arise And make avowal he is born of God? Rabbis. We wait. The sea is waiting and the stars. We all are ready and the night grows deep. You see him? Do you see the Sainted? Yonder, Clean arrows of the stars shoot round a darkness That should be he, tranquil and set with waves. Rubio. What a patience! His entrails must be cold as the belly of a corpse in its new grave: mine starve at the thought. Primo. Why should he break his silence? Sabbataï Is silent ever, and he will not speak. Rabbis. He will. The stars have told us, The sea has told us, The Heavens—the Earth, Our hearts. Rubio. What do I do here? The city is gone away from life into sleep. It is deaf. Minarets and cypresses are tipped with snow, the Acropolis lies under a roof of snow; I should lie under my Syrian rug, if I were not too much of a beggar to own one. God of Israel, we are all beggars here, we are all hungry and cold! Have mercy, have mercy—feed Thou our emptiness! Rabbis. The sea is icier than the snow. The stars are whiter. He is gone from sight, he has closed himself away. No, no, he is there again. He moves. He is coming.... He comes up from the waters of the deep. O everlasting Ocean! See, he moves, As rhythmic as a wave on toward the land, Dripping the ocean from his head: the stars Scatter their silver tresses round. The stars,— The stars are wild and rapturous. He is coming.... It is silent. The rams' horns Are silent so from new moon to new moon. The thunder of the sky Is silent thus before its instant. God, We will be silent, for our hearts have voice Waiting for breath breathed on them by thy Will! [They make no sound, but as Sabbataï comes nearer they draw back. We dare not.... We must move or cry. O terror! God moves upon the waters. Who abides His coming? On the shore he sets his feet. The waving stars, the flame-haired Seraphim! Beautiful is his coming; Bare the star-rays About his naked form ... the night's expansion! Peace! He is standing silent. Heaven and Earth And sea and stars and men are therefrom silent. Oh! [They hold their breath. [Sabbataï seems to be drinking in power from the universe as he stands naked before them. At last over the shore and city is heard one cry. Sabbataï. Jhwh! [There is a moment of panic as the forbidden name is spoken. A Rabbi (in the whisper of a death-chamber). Who may speak the Name but one? A Chorus. Messiah! Hail, Messiah! Sent of God! Born to his people! Our Deliverance! See, see, he stands before us. Primo. He has spoken, The stars have heard the Name and did not fall, The sea has heard it and the sea extends Floating and calm; the night has heard and shines Across its ragged cloud; we too have heard, And live and shout our joy—out of our joy We see and know God's Chosen. Rabbis. Sabbataï! Our King, our Lord of Lords! The true Messiah! The King of all Kings, the Celestial Lion! Who will redeem his people! Who will gather The remnant from the winds! Our joy, our joy! He is the true Messiah! Sabbataï! And without weapons he shall wage his war, And quell the dragon with no weapon raised. Rubio. He will take away our reproach, he will fill us with good things and gold will pertain to him. Let us believe and we shall be princes. Primo. We must believe, for the sky stands; the sea, And stars of heaven are white as snow about him Who has joined heaven and earth With the four sounds of God's mysterious Name, Uniting the Creator and His World. We must believe; it is not left to faith— We have heard the Name and live, we have seen the night, The host of heaven, the ocean and the shore Secure while the intolerable touched Voiceful each mortal substance. Let us pray To God, our God, we be of His true Kingdom, And of Messiah's Kingdom that begins. [They lift their arms. From all the snowy minarets come voices. The Muéddin. God is great, there is no God but God, Mohammed is God's prophet. [Sabbataï, as if waking from a trance, shivers. Sabbataï. It is cold. Rubio. Prince, your entrails must be chilled in your belly. The God of Jacob warm them! Primo. Holy One, let us go back with praises! We have outstripped the dawn now thou art risen— Our Sun that shineth. We are blest, we are saved. (The Rabbis fall on their faces before him, but Rubio lifts up to him his gabardine and turban from under the stones of a rock. Scene II Smyrna. Evening. The courtyard of Chelibi's house. In the midst, a fountain; to the right, a knot of cypress-trees; to the left, great rose-bushes; to the back, the chief wall of the house, white and pierced irregularly with windows, a door to the left hand in the wall. To the extreme left of the courtyard, an entrance into the street stands open. The courtyard is empty. A Chorus of lovely Virgins enters from the archway with lamps. As they pass the fountain they pause, let fall their swinging lamps that twinkle in the water, then lift them up and advance toward the cypresses with a cry. Chorus. We are waiting for the Bridegroom, we are waiting, We are waiting for his call; We love him—his graces, His light on our faces, And he loves us whatever may befall. Lilith. He loveth me as if he loved me only, He loveth me as his Bride. His hands—they are clinging; When I answer my voice is singing: He loveth me as he loveth none beside. Rachel. We are waiting for the Bridegroom, we are waiting, And the Bridegroom hath the Bride; He has chosen her; she loveth him; He has chosen her; our lights are dim; For the beloved of the Bridegroom is the Bride. Ruth. We are waiting for the Bridegroom, each handmaiden, We are waiting for his call; What he biddeth we shall do it— If we deny him aught we rue it. His power be on us all! Eve. We are waiting for the Bridegroom, for his Kingdom, For the glory of our race; Many people before him shall stand; He shall greet his Elect on his right hand He shall give them place. Judith. We are waiting for the Bridegroom and he rideth, He rides as a man of war; He embraceth the foe at his feet; He rideth in victory complete, He rideth from afar. Lilith. But he delays his coming, but our Lord Delays his coming. Let us leave the cypress, And cross you to the roses—by the archway Let us make cluster, for our Lord delays. [Lilith leads the Maidens towards the rose-bushes; they form a gleaming knot by the archway. Ruth. Let us in all things yield perpetual praise. [She carefully trims her lamp and sits down low on a stone of the archway. From the house-door servants and slaves come forth, spreading flowers and carpets and dragging out wine-pots. Then a band of honourable men pace slowly behind the fountain and draw up in a phalanx before the cypresses. They are followed by Chelibi, the Master of the Feast, Samuel Primo, and Nathan of Gaza, who take up their stations round the fountain, among high purple flags and rushes in bloom. Poor Jews begin to enter from without, humbly inclining to the Master of the Feast. Then an old man approaches, receiving every mark of honour. Chelibi. Rabbi-physician, a welcome. We scarcely hoped to see Nachmonides. Nachmonides. I am old and feeble; let me sit by your fountain to freshen my weariness. I am exceeding weak. By day and night such concourse of suffering fills my ante-chambers I can eat but one meal for day and night. I lie down, or my sick would consult a corpse; on my back I prescribe, I talk. When night falls my voice is gone from me; but many poor mortals are in the way of life and of its holiness—so God has His praise. Chelibi. It is regretted by many of our nation that you never converse with the healthy or with those that would have instruction of your wisdom. Nachmonides. It would delight me—it would be a great joy ... [A litter is borne through the archway; the Maidens half rise, then, perceiving the procession is not yet, they sink down. An old Jew follows his son on the litter. Old Jew. Lay the boy down there, he will see all.... Woe 's me! [He sits his head between his knees, making low groans. Chelibi. Nachmonides would discourse of his science—but there is too much pain! Well, you have risen up, Nachmonides, from your couch among your sufferers to greet the Bridegroom of Israel. Nachmonides. True! I was eagerly constrained as if my youth returned; yet I left my precincts full of people. There is a patient of mine! Poor boy, poor hopeless boy, he has felt the zeal! He is come, as his physician is come. This Sabbataï is a magician. [Nachmonides raises himself up, dips a bowl in the fountain and goes over to the boy. Moses, the evening is hot. Let me freshen your lips.... For life! Old Jew. For a happy life! The lad will not open his eyes. Nachmonides. He opens his teeth to the water. Old Jew. He awaits Messiah. Nachmonides. May his Rock keep him! [He returns to the fountain. Chelibi. We are glad you are come to the Feast, our good Nachmonides. Nachmonides. I am a believer in marriage, though this marriage.... Your Queen is not a spotless Queen, Master Secretary. She has roamed the lands ... Nathan (tossing his head). She has roved the lands seeking him, our heart's need. It was foretold her in a dream she should wed Messiah. Primo. She did not recognise Messiah in his majesty, she passed by as he was giving alms to a beggar— for the Scriptures must be fulfilled. Nachmonides (tapping Primo's hand). But he should have recognised her, Master Primo; he should have discovered the spots beneath her gay attire. We physicians have cognisance of health and disease. He should have known this woman that she was a sinner. Rubio. I am the beggar my Lord gave alms to. Did I ask an alms? He knew me, he recognised I was a beggar, and he gave me ... Nathan. We do not need your testimony. Hosanna to him who fills the purse-bag is your testimony. Rubio (not heeding). He knew I was a beggar and he gave me what a beggar needs—a smile. Our lady Zarah was passing, she was arrested by that smile. Nachmonides. Or did she stop to win another for herself? We all know Zarah—she would pause to admire the action and then dazzle the young prophet with her eyes. Rubio. We all know Zarah—the beggar knows her; she is a bounteous lady, well known to the city since she landed, yet at times she has fared hard. She has been stoned and had to shrink away to the beggar's quarters. There Messiah found us. Nachmonides. And there he gave her an alms? Rubio. He gave her what a man gives a woman; he gave her ... Primo (coughing). It has been foretold that Messiah shall marry a wife of whoredoms. So the Lord commanded Hosea. Nachmonides. No precedents, Master Primo, no precedents for a miracle. It is the unforeseen, the undivined, the never-to-be-thought of ... Rubio. Look you—this wedding is no miracle, for our pretty lady of Smyrna has her tricks; but that Messiah should come down and say to me ‘Son, give me thy heart’ (glancing at Primo) even as it is written in the Scriptures ... Primo. You are a wine-bibber, you are a wine-bibber. You are come here for the wine. Away with your lewdness. You shall not profane our Courts. [He strikes Rubio; there is a hubbub; again the Virgins rise, startled. Voices. We will put you out of the Synagogue. You shall not escape us. The Messiah calls Kings. Rubio. He calls beggars and harlots. A Voice (from the litter). Peace, peace! I have heard the Bridegroom's voice—peace! Lilith. Maidens, arise! For he comes—the joy of our eyes! Rubio. I will greet him with cymbals that clash to the skies! I will greet his bride, with the wild, free eyes, Zarah, Zarah, the Queen! Primo. Queen of the South—this too is prophecy, And every Scripture Must be fulfilled, however it degrade The prophet to fulfil it. Presently I take my share in these indignities— Zarah the Queen! [But the slight hubbub of the hostile band is drowned by the thrilled voices of the Virgins as they crowd to the open, vacant archway. Chorus. We are waiting, we are waiting, for the Bridegroom— He loveth me as he loveth none beside! [They press through the archway singing— then the whole company follows them out. After an interval the cortège appears and Sabbataï enters with Zarah under a canopy: they passs through the courtyard and enter the door of the house; the crowd that follows remains in the courtyard. The door is shut. Voices. He must remain with us. He is within. It is to see his face.... Who shut the door? We cannot breathe without him. A Woman. Deborah, You are breathing roses. Deborah. But he is the rose, The rose of Sharon and the lily's budding. A Voice. Who shut the door? A Muted Chorus. Our hearts are sore for him; If he return not, our breath will fail; Willing we were with him to sail, Through a storm, on a stormy sea! [They prostrate themselves and wail. Our garments we rend and spread— He leaves us; we cannot be comforted.... He leaves us, his people, for one. He has a fair Bride, and we We are as the sands of the sea; We are as the sand. Will he love us and understand, Though we are as grains in his hand, We are one? Whither is he?—the time is a thousand years. Will he return to us and dry our tears? He will return; fall back and worship him, Burn bright, O eyes grown dim! (Sabbataï issues with Zarah and their company. He meets the people with a smile and parted lips. Sabbataï. My own belovèd, but ye are my chosen; This is the moment of my triumph—this! I have heard your crying for me, my beloved, Therefore I am your God. This is the sign! So long I waited for the sign and knew not If I were chosen of my God; ye call me, I heard you at my marriage wail for me. The hour is come.... Enter my Kingdom, enter, Innumerable as the stars! I see you As in a vision—every lifted heart Is incense to me, as the glowing fields Of tulips glow from heads innumerable. I have created you Simply as God createth the green herb. Ye are my pleasure and my prophecy, My Chosen; ye shall never doubt. Bear witness, I have lived with you, my multitude, and loved you, On your many voices I have heard one speech; I have heard you one by one—the sign Of knowing you is in my heart. You have fed me, From your homes and from your harbour and from your streets, Buoying me up as the waves buoy a vessel, Sustaining me. I choose you, My lone, my sorrowful, for I am lonely; I choose you, O ye poor, for I am rich; I call you who have never heard a call, Never suspected that God thought on you! O aged, you must put away your age; O young men, you must laugh long in your youth, Without remembering it will pass and never Will it pass from you. Ye are my disciples Who love your youth and fear it not. Ye sons Of God, ye giants, who behold how lovely A woman is and tremble. Sons, despair not— Deep in the sea I heard you; at my ear I heard you, as the music of a shell. Ye were my music ... I must have musicians, They must be always with me. Come, my dearest, And I will make you strong. Such secrets I heard from you. From the unfathomed sea I heard them in my heart. Your instruments!... For speech is growing old. [He takes a band of rather sheepish young men apart, touches their instruments and gives instructions for a dance. Suddenly he looks up from an instrument he is tuning and sees Zarah deserted, her Virgins listless about her. Belovèd, come! Eve, Judith, Ruth, Zarah—daughters, Daughters of Zion, on my marriage-day Desire hath reached deliverance. Ye remember How Zion sigheth in captivity.... But now her shroud is lifted from the garments Of her delight; the ashes Bedust no more the roses of her chaplet; The bitter myrtles ring with chips of gold; For she shall sigh no more. Virgins and youths, Ye shall rejoice. Come, Hillel, Absalom! No more ye dance in parted bands, together Ye dance ... [He pauses in a hush of joy as the bands of youths and maidens unite in the dance. The ryhthm breaks!... O Zarah, see! One riseth not, this cripple riseth not; He is left out ... [Sabbataï runs to the boy and lifts him by his hands. Rise, for you must, dear lad! How strong, how lithe! [He joins the boy's hands with Rachel's; the old father falls flat on his face. Now it is full—there is no dissonance. [He gives his hands to Zarah. Zarah—your face! How many summer days, And lighting of the rose-light on the dawn, Thou hast gathered for me in this moment's face. Thou canst not speak ... hush, hush! Move to the sound. [He leads her to the dance. Primo. A miracle! Bear witness! Summon the Master of the Feast, go, summon Chelibi. A miracle! You saw, Nachmonides? Nachmonides. I am a doctor; this boy had not a sound limb of his body. Sabbataï has made him skip. Skip, Moses, skip! This Sabbataï, this beautiful young man, has the breath of God moving him, as in dream, to power. It is an adorable nature! May the young Rabbi be Messiah indeed! He shows us most continent faith toward God, even God our Health. It rejoices me to see his day. Nathan. A miracle—that is what imports us. A miracle! He hath done wonders as the chosen of God, foretold by the Ancient Script—En-Soph, the Son of Heaven! Nachmonides. Peace, peace! Each acclamation of the deed of faith does harm to the doer. Less absolute becomes in the Creature his frankness with God his Creator. Keep silence, as ye love Sabbataï. (To the boy's father.) Old man, watch your son and weep for joy. O Nathan Ghazati, you are young; the voice in you is not that of the white-haired whose lips are as old instruments mellow. Do not speak when the lips move; do not speak till the heart has brooded on the voice between its wings. [Exit. Nathan. Does he think the mumblings of age transform the world and proclaim power and empire? Does the Son of Heaven want piping greybeards to go before him? Here is a miracle! Primo. It shall be written to every country of the Jews' Dispersion. All shall rejoice. [Chelibi advances. Nathan. Chelibi, O Saraph-Bashi, a miracle! Chelibi. That my house should be so honoured! Primo (catching Moses). This impotent boy is dancing like Hillel. Moses. I am dancing, dancing; I am whole—I leap Crag to crag, as David when he kept the sheep. You shall not stay me. Primo. But the Master's fame. Moses. I yield my limbs—feel them, examine, show them, Beckon!—but surely none will leave the dance! Chelibi. Ah, stripling, there is nothing men will not flee from more quickly than their peculiar happiness. They will leave it for misfortune, for an accident, for any promise of a spectacle; they will leave it for the dear misery each man craves to hug to his bosom as his own; and for sake of a miracle ... were it only to see little worms in feathers, they would cross the ocean. Nathan (in a shout). A miracle, a miracle! Come and behold! Chelibi. Look, look! [The dance breaks up and a crowd gathers. Old Jew (stroking his son's feet). I am his father, I am proud of him. God gave him strength to dance at the Great Feast. Primo. It was Sabbataï that wrought the miracle, you fool! Sabbataï is shown forth as Messiah. I will write it to all lands. ‘Then shall the lame leap as an hart’—Every Scripture fulfilled! Voices. A work of God! Sabbataï is Messiah. He heals diseases. He will heal God's people. A Sephardi. These limbs are good as my son's— the pride of the port, when he shoulders his figs— Valorea's. Another. Come, let us see you caper. [A break in the circle discovers Sabbataï and Zarah at rest under rose-trees. Sabbataï (as he fans her with a great fan of feathers). They all desert Messiah. Zarah. All but Zarah— She cannot; she is happy as a leaf On the stream's journey; she is borne along. [The dancers close round. Enter a train of Ambassadors. Perplexed they pass to the group in the centre and bow to Moses Ambassadors. We come from many lands, We come, gifts in our hands; They are gifts from our lands—all lands Are his; we are his bands, And the chosen people he commands. Moses (in terror). O Kings, I am not the Messiah. Primo. From afar! Take heed, good Smyrnites, it comes to pass, Kings from afar! [The Ambassadors have been gravely unpacking their perfumes and treasure. Rubio staggers to the group. Primo. But where is the Messiah? Rubio. Where is Messiah?—drinking, he is drunk; I found him by the wine-jars. [The Ambassadors give a little start and instinctively clutch at their rich vessels. Primo. By the wine-jars, Drunken, but not with wine, but not as Noah ... Nathan. With wine of prophecy. Primo (low to Nathan). But how it sways— This throne on which they have exalted him! [Sabbataï is borne forward on a throne. He carries the great fan of feathers. Zarah and the Virgins follow dancing. Sabbataï's kinsfolk are round him, acclaiming. Kinsfolk. Messiah, Messiah, we bow the knee! At the sight of him our vision swims; There is scent of gold about his limbs! He is Messiah—and my cousin too! Joseph, you drank the wine.... The wine is new. Enthrone him, he is true, Messiah! We smell the gold in him! Gold as the Golden Seraphim That covered the Ark is he, And we are his kin and we Shall have of his riches. See! These gifts; we are all of his fold. We shall do as he biddeth us. Behold, It is lapis lazuli! [They set down Sabbataï, enthroned. Moses, fixing doubtful eyes on Sabbataï, hobbles back towards his litter. Sabbataï (greeting the Ambassadors with exultation). Come to me, happy kings, come to me, brethren! (To his Kinsfolk.) And you too shall be kings, all kings, each one. (To Ambassadors.) You must be kings, you offer gifts—and these, These must be kings, for they have greedy eyes For incense and for gold. Good Rubio, The Ambassadors are thirsty; they must drink. Lade the young slaves with goblets. And meanwhile I will distribute gifts. I am Messiah Simply because my gifts transcend your gifts. I have the sky, the stars to give. [Glancing at the choir of Virgins. The pearls Of the midmost caverns—I can see the pearls Each crescive in its shell. [Restraining his Kinsfolk who are greedily handling the treasure of the Ambassadors. No, no! my manners! These, these are mine—this incense ... [Rising and addressing the Ambassadors. Greeks, Arabians— Far-travelled people, who in rocks and caverns And in thick-peopled cities have had token, As the tokens of an earthquake in your hearts, That ye should come to me—I have been with you In prison and in sorrow. One by one As if you were my flock I have succoured you. I know you, some of you most faithful, some Most ignorant. Some are there that believe And some believe not.... Yea, it is not that; My world, my starry multitudes, ye love me, Ye have desired me from the ends of time. Infinite is my love to you, the beating Of my heart to own you all. From many lands Ye bring me each the riches of your lands, And the peculiar treasure ... [Laying a vase of perfume beside him, after deeply snuffing it. But this perfume Is strange to me, as perfume should be strange, A novelty as welcome as an old, Delicious memory. Gems, carbuncles— These all for me, my wearing and my glory. (Smiling.) No crown that I shall ever give away, Or weary of, or lose. Unguents and herbs! Where is Nachmonides? [Primo hastily approaches Sabbataï and whispers. Primo (withdrawing). Balms, lusty bundles That carry life. Sabbataï. I cannot use them—healing Is with me; I am Health. And here is gold! [He shivers before a great block of gold. Rubio. Master, they will think you drunk if you stare so excessively. Sabbataï. More wine, good Rubio— More wine! Remove that block. Idolaters, That is the golden calf and it will crush you To atoms if you fall and worship it. Now for my gifts! Elias Zevi, you, First of my brethren, I name King of Kings; You, Joseph Zevi ... it has slipped my brain What you inherit ... [The Ambassadors are now deeply drinking. King of Judah's King! And Isaac Silvera ... [Putting his hand to his brow. Ah, now it is all plain; in thee I find the Soul of David and thy Kingdom Is therefore Persia. England I appoint To thee, Mokiah Gaspar, for no reason But that thou art an ass—inspired By stubbornness to thwart men from their doom. It must be that ... the rest is in a vision Of eagles and their young. Nathan. He prophesies! All ears! Attention! It is prophecy When animals grow wings—Leviathan Wrinkles the waves and the ox turns himself Slowly as if revolving on a wheel. [He strains to hear more. Sabbataï. To Chelibi, My well-beloved King Joash, Egypt, Egypt, With Nile in perpetuity. For Nathan Red-sanded Barbary. Nathan (prostrating himself). Malka Kadisha, hail, Most holy King, Messiah! Sabbataï. Jeroboam— There is no place; it is the Vizirs now; Smaller they get and smaller, till the last Is of no size at all; but every king Shall have a Vizir.... You are all content? Rubio. I am not content, Master; I am your beggar and you have given me nothing. [Sabbataï rises from his throne, gapes and lays a hand on Rubio's shoulder. Sabbataï. For you the whole Of Lebanon, this Smyrna ... Turkey. All The earth I will apportion.... But the people! They too must have a kingdom—Paradise, The Heaven, my kingdom. Lo, This fan ... I waft it! Moses—ah, no rod! A miracle of laughter— Pure laughter to you all, pure divination! Touch it, my people—the least waft Of its feathers on your cheek and ye are saved. Saved! The long faces widen into smiles.... Grave Rabbis, ye shall leap. My kingdom Is come when ye shall tuck the scrolls of Law Under your arms and dance. The synagogues Must skip as the little hills. My fan, my fan! Old men, this fairy touch To thrill your wrinkles! Mothers, no more care; Your sons are glorious, and I am your son— To each of you Messiah. Virgins, Virgins, The butterflies light thus! ... Saved, saved, Rebecca! Hillel ... ha, ha! ... and Primo ... [There is a solemn, smiling tumult as the people sway up to the fan tipped toward them. Meanwhile the kings have fallen into violent quarrelling; in their heat they strike and hustle each other. One precious jar of ointment is shattered. The Ambassadors anxiously collect their treasure, protecting their offerings with their arms. Weary at last, Sabbataï turns to his empty throne; the long fan droops restlessly as he stands on the steps, struck by the sight of Zarah. My beloved, My kingdom! You are speechless as a rose. How I can deck you! Your eyes are set as jewels on this fabric. How I can deck you! [He holds out his hands to the Ambassadors who fill them with necklets and amulets. The mines are shaking to unearth their gems, And Araby and India. I groan! I am a god, and a god must not worship. [He slowly decks Zarah with pearl-ropes and with earrings, sighing. But yet this perfect stillness; as a star Drops in the lake this pearl is on your bosom. I am now as I rose up from the sea, And had no voice.... Wondering, I reached my kingdom. (Turning to the Ambassadors.) This is my Bride. She is prepared, adorned. It is to me as she came down from heaven, It is to me a miracle. Behold her! This is the very city of our God— The secret that I whisper ... this is Zion. (To Nathan and Primo.) Softly ... bring hither my disciples.... Fair! How fair—my dove of the rocks' clefts! Secret to me ... but manifest to these. [In the growing dusk the band of young disciples is faintly seen; recognisable, Sabbataï stands apart as before a vision.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Chorus of lovely Virgins enters from the archway with lamps. As they pass the fountain they pause, let fall their swinging lamps that twinkle in the water, then lift them up and advance toward the cypresses with a cry. Chorus. We are waiting for the Bridegroom, we are waiting, We are waiting for his call; We love him—his graces, His light on our faces, And he loves us whatever may befall. Lilith. He loveth me as if he loved me only, He loveth me as his Bride. His hands—they are clinging; When I answer my voice is singing: He loveth me as he loveth none beside. Rachel. We are waiting for the Bridegroom, we are waiting, And the Bridegroom hath the Bride; He has chosen her; she loveth him; He has chosen her; our lights are dim; For the beloved of the Bridegroom is the Bride. Ruth. We are waiting for the Bridegroom, each handmaiden, We are waiting for his call; What he biddeth we shall do it— If we deny him aught we rue it. His power be on us all! Eve. We are waiting for the Bridegroom, for his Kingdom, For the glory of our race; Many people before him shall stand; He shall greet his Elect on his right hand He shall give them place. Judith. We are waiting for the Bridegroom and he rideth, He rides as a man of war; He embraceth the foe at his feet; He rideth in victory complete, He rideth from afar.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II Scene I The seashore beyond Smyrna. On the stony coast oleanders press their bloom together. It is dawn. A tall, winged, glancing figure is pacing the edges of the waves beside Sabbataï. Sabbataï (stopping; then turning to front the figure). Who art thou? The Figure. Gabriel. Sabbataï. Oh, then, thou bringest tidings of my God: Thou art ever in His presence. The Figure. Thou art closer To Him than I. He feeds thee from His fountains. Sabbataï. From the most secret places of the rocks With the water that sprang forth at Moses' stroke. Angel, I cannot show the world this fountain; It makes green, silent pastures in my heart, The song that beamed through David's blood, the springtide That blossoms through these withies as a rose. I have no speech—I am where silence is— I never have revealed myself, except By rising from the sea, as the sun rises Apparent on his journey with no sound. I have no voice.... Can there be voices, angel, For anything we feel, our sleep, our waking, The changes in us when we love, we die? I have no tongue— My hour is secret ... and the world athirst. The Figure. Speak, O Messiah, what is in your heart! This perfect morning God would have you choose, Taking no counsel, your devoted path, As birds raise up their wings. Sabbataï. If He had told me! What need, O Gabriel, you should leave His throne If this had welled up in me? The Figure. It has welled— That thou shouldst sail in a Saic barque, Garnished with gold that men may mark; Shouldst sail away to the Soldan's land, And to sound of shawms take in thy hand The crown of the world from the Soldan's head, Thyself being crowned and no blood shed, No crying from those that are slaughtered, And no silence from those that are dead. Atone, that for thy tarrying and thy doubt I left God's presence. Sabbataï. Hie thee to the Throne. My dream is given me. I will go alone To the sound of music— The Figure. No, Messiah, thou Must lead the people to thy music now. Call the Musicians— Call the Mariners ... [The Figure vanishes. Sabbataï (extending his arm toward the sea). God, thou hast sent thy Angel Gabriel To quicken me: Thou grievest me in this. Thou sendest forth thy messengers to men To warn them or forbid: to thine elect Thou art as the sparkle in the diamond, That has no entrance ... [Nachmonides, in his black cloak and turban, comes along the shore with feeble steps. Sabbataï meets him. Ah, Nachmonides! I could embrace these towers of rose. [Pointing to the shrubs. What breath Of roses and death and nard!—I have my dream. Nachmonides. Rabbi, we have seen your faith: what is your dream? Sabbataï. Messiah's dream—to live the prophecies. Nachmonides. Messiah is the whole of the prophecies. Think not of fulfilment if indeed you are chosen. Rabbi, do not tempt God. Prophecies come unto men—the cranes fly back to announce the spring, but spring appears when the hour is come. What joy of face you have! Can prophecies awake such dominion? Sabbataï. The prophecy of Nathan— That I shall take the world with harmony From all the instruments of string and vent, Issuing their deep compulsion; that the Soldan Shall let my hands discrown him, as the year, With horns, with blaring trumpet, abdicates To the new year of time. I sail, Nachmonides. God bids me sail—sail with dispassioned music— Then lead the Soldan captive to the river Sabbation, then lead my people homeward To Holy Land.... It is the prophecy. Nachmonides. But where are the words of the antique prophets? Is there in Torah the naming of your river Sabbation? Elijah, Isaiah! What have they to do with the Soldan Mohammed? What with Nathan Ghazati? Sabbataï. The Kabbala, Nachmonides, to me Is more profoundly open than to any, Even than to Chayim Vital: it foretells The triumph of the Holy King, my triumph. You are a Talmudist—your eyes are blind. Nachmonides. Ah, Rabbi—that book of destruction, that nurse of falsehood, your Kabbala—would you had never unrolled it! Sabbataï. Never without the treasures of its sea Had I been called and given the voice of God! Why take my spirit from me, unbeliever? Why come on gladness as deficiency? Go to your sick! Farewell, Nachmonides. Nachmonides. God's blessing preserve you, Rabbi! Nachmonides may be a vain babbler till he lie down among his patients; but, stretched on his back, he would praise you as full of life, yet warn you as nourishing death—to his subtle eyesight even at this moment unconcealed—he would instruct of the remedies, as thus: to stay in Smyrna, to put a foot on no vessel for any port; to burn your Kabbala with flame of fire, and let the light within you shine out as a pharos. Sabbataï. God's angel has been with me out of heaven: As from God's lips I am breathed on for this sailing. The stress of Gabriel's pinion bore my doom. Nachmonides. I would I were laid on my back; but behold, I am standing on feeble legs—and Messiah needs no physician. Well, Rabbi, God be with you! Scene II Smyrna. Outside Chelibi's house. To the left the last column of the portico stands out against sea and sky from the wall of the house itself that makes an angle. In the thickness of this wall a narrow door is just seen. A table stands in the shade of the house. From the column toward the right, a low marble wall with a marble seat along it runs in front of the sea till it is suddenly broken by a gap through which steps descend to the port. The wall is continued to the extreme right, where the topmost sails of a vessel rise, half furled and golden, from the water below. Sabbataï lies along the seat under the column, lazing with the sea. In the court, under the further portion of the marble wall a group of children is in the midst of a game. One of the children steals up. Child. Play with us, lord. You are dull, left alone. Play with us! Sabbataï. Shall I be your king? Child. If you will watch us running races— If you will give us crowns ... Sabbataï. You choose—? [The children gather round him and speak in chorus. Children. We choose you for our king, We choose you! We will bring you in our hands The little tortoise for caressing, And to receive your blessing. We will take you by the hand To see where the tall swans stand. Have you guessed Where is their nest? We will draw you into our own land. You shall watch with us where blue larks in the sky Cease to sing; We will leave you—and by-and-by Rush down on you with a cry. It shall rock in the palace as if the stones should cry, For you are our king, We choose you, And we love you best: You shall play with us for ever, We will not loose you, We love you best. Sabbataï (caressing the children). Fetch me the little tortoise—Chayim, you! It shall receive my blessing. [The lad runs off. Zeuna, keep For me the secret where the swan has built Her nest.... Come hither, little ones! [He feeds them with Turkish Delight. What chicks ... what little, lusting mouths, Smeared with the sweet, and happy.... More, but more! [Nathan Ghazati enters with the Kings Isaac Silvera and Mokiah Gaspar, who retire sullenly to the seat above the vessel, while Nathan stands before Sabbataï. The children play a little with Sabbataï's fingers and fringes— then shyly creep away. Nathan. Master, what has not been revealed to these babes, has been revealed to me. You must start this day. The Children of the Promise must be led to their Kingdom. Lo, the Lion of Judah in a light skiff, sets sail in my vision: the sea is wide, 'mid the aura from the sea a moon in its last quarter and crowned above its crescent is sinking for ever. The waves of the wide sea are churned by the vessel. You must start to-day. Sabbataï (drawing Nathan down beside him). Your eyes are full of spotted fire, my Nathan! How can I start till the false prophet come I have commanded to my royal presence? Your vision signs not of to-day—to-morrow I sail, nor leave an enemy behind, Even with a dream in front. How fresh the waves! How fresh they curl along, how exquisite This waiting is—as when a rose-tree waits The breath and the disparting of the rose! Do not the waves fold over, fold aside To whisper one another of this voyage? What buoyancy is in them, a delight As buoyant to my limbs as they would bear me Without a ship to haven ... [He turns, taking a fresh position as he picks little stones from the wall. Exquisite This waiting, this delay! No more to do Than the children playing yonder. Though the city Be thronged and bustling and the people mad, No matter! Infinite in blue The dawning, infinite the eve in light. [Nathan rises impatiently as Primo enters from the house with two Poles. Primo. These worthy men, Isaiah Levi and Leb Hertz ... Sabbataï (embracing them). But we remember.... Welcome, brethren, welcome! Are you not sent by Nehemiah Cohen? Does he obey our mandate? 1st Pole. We are his heralds. He accepts with delight your invitation. He would see you, for we have described to him your glory; we recounted to him the miracle. Sabbataï. What miracle? 2nd Pole. The marvellous help you afforded the Jews of Jerusalem, paying the full impost out of Egypt as from your own purse. Sabbataï (smiling). You are believers? 1st Pole. We would be believers in the true Messiah. We would hear. Nehemiah is very learned in dispute—he is solid. [Primo is summoned within. Sabbataï (clouding). We will set his doubts at rest. He shall be our forerunner, our herald—not our enemy. (To the Kings Isaac Silvera and Mokiah Gaspar). Accompany these strangers to my ship. There is the miracle! [Exeunt. Nathan (hiding his face on the wall). O Master, you are my despair! On me the burthen! I curse you as I should curse the child unravelling a drag-net for the waters. Rabbi, you will ruin me in your ruin. All your Kings are in revolt. Sabbataï (stroking Nathan's head). I do not love my Kings, my black-haired, my beloved. Nathan. If you loved me—if you knew.... Master, for two hours I have been soothing the Kings, I have been describing to them their dominions that you might not be tortured. All I can say to them now but incites them. Your mariners curse you on the beach. Sabbataï. Nathan has cursed me. Nathan. I have cursed your mariners! I tell you there is treason in the port. The city is weary of you; you are a fly sticking in its honey. These sleek Poles to whom you are so soft, speak of another Messiah, who comes with the keen lips of a sword.... Master, we are a downtrodden people: we may not walk the streets save in the badge of our shame, we may not deck our wives, we may not make beautiful our houses or lift our voices from their roofs in psalmody. Are you not a Jew? But you do not feel the deep rancour in your heart. You make terms with the English merchants—they approve you as honest. You make terms, you palter. you are inexorable. When Messiah comes he will strike upward as with a people from underground ... [Chelibi approaches. Sabbataï. I am being chidden, Chelibi. Chelibi. Our good prophet is impatient, but his impatience is honourable. Your train is very burdensome to Smyrna. Kings without kingdoms are a very troublesome kind of kings—they make subjects of every honest citizen. They sweep up tribute, and the traffic of the bazaars is stopped. Our little Smyrna is incommoded; and to speak truth, there is nothing so incommodious as a project. I would have you leave, dear Rabbi, before the Cadi and his Turkish officers force you to leave us. Be advised. Sabbataï. Chelibi, Nehemiah is at our gates; you are hospitable. Did you not provide my marriage-feast? Nehemiah has travelled very far at my bidding. Go within, prepare the table for my foe. [Exit Chelibi within. [Sabbataï turns dreamily to the sea and whistles—then turns to Nathan. If this should be Messiah—Ephraim Messiah, the forerunner! I shall know when I see him! I shall know if he is beloved of God. He says I have had no forerunner—that is true ... Nathan (shaking his fist at Sabbataï). You have called me your Elijah, you have said.... But I will defeat this Nehemiah, I will defeat his wiles. There cannot be two forerunners, two Elijahs, two Ephraim-Messiahs. I will make merry with this squat-faced German. I will make him foolish in your presence. Sabbataï. Dear Nathan, if he hate me, I shall laugh at him. I do not laugh at my lovers. It is serious if any man love me; and he becomes of account at once. (To Primo who approaches bowing very low). No, Primo, I will not see the Rabbis from Jerusalem— No, nor the deputation from Cairo— No, nor the inquirers from Pesth— No, nor the meddlesome flatterers from Spain, I will not see them. Leave me! Primo (bowing more low). Master, it is I, your anxious secretary and your devoted servant—I present myself humbly to remind you that it is the year of millennium, that the year has dawned. Nathan. It is the year of millennium ... Sabbataï. Then it is millennium as harvest-time is harvest.... Let me be at peace. [Primo goes back three steps, then turns. Primo. Master, I have told your mariners it is the year of the millennium, and they aver the wind is most favourable—a choice wind, but a temporary ... Sabbataï. The wind is too favourable, I would start in a western gale. Primo stands. Primo. An officer from the Cadi awaits your leisure. Sabbataï. Leisure—but is not a god all leisure? Is not a god always at his ease? You suppose him all ear!—meanwhile he conducts his car through the heavens. Primo (more stolidly). The Cadi demands that in three days you set sail. Sabbataï. Would he break the poise of the millennium with a threat? Send away these malcontents, tell them all things are possible with God. Send them away—let them broider banners, let them broider banners with the word Millennium writ large. Primo. And the believers ... Sabbataï. The believers are maddening me! But my ship! I will go down to the quay. They have brought her round. Primo. Nehemiah? [Shaking himself free, Sabbataï descends the steps. The lad Chayim, with a tortoise in his arms, looks round the square, catches sight of Sabbataï and runs after him. Nathan. So God eludes us! And I stretched forth my arms to him. Primo. He should prepare—he should turn to the Kabbala, the Talmud, all the Holy Books; this German comes to prove him vain by texts and long disputations. But I forget! He is Messiah and furnished of God. I must satisfy the officer, I must satisfy the deputations, as if I had bread to give them. [Rubio slides up with a bag of money and a crate of Syrian apples. He lays them down and offers an apple to Primo. Rubio. A fruit! Primo. Put it down; these are offerings to God. Rubio (chewing). The Master does not eat. Primo. And this sack of treasure? Rubio. That too is an offering. Primo. O beggar Rubio, and the Master does not prize it! Rubio. That is the Master's weakness. Treasure is treasure. The Lord God hid his treasure in the bowels of the earth; we touch his secret when we discover gold. Primo. No, Rubio, God's secret is his Messiah. Rubio. The Messiah is the key that unlocks His secret. Primo. You have no sign—save the sign of the prophet Jonah, the whale—the infinite capacity of swallowing. Rubio. Who, then, is the wonder-worker—Jonah or the whale? Primo. Answer as you will after your kind. But treasure is treasure—there you have said the word. [Exit, snatching the sack. [Rubio advances to Nathan, his hands open. Nathan. Still at your old occupation? Rubio. Still at my old occupation! No treasure for me! Give me my kingdom, give me Turkey— Turkey in Europe and Turkey in Asia, they are both mine, and I have refused a thousand pounds for each. Nathan. A fool and his kingdoms! Peace, beggar! Rubio. If nothing is to alter ... and I hear there is much disputing whether the Master even has power to sweep away the great Fast-day—it has set up a party against him and men grumble—if we are to suffer in our stomachs and for our sins, well ... [Zarah is come out of the house in royal apparel. Let us serve the Queen, the Queen of Pleasure, who moves among men with no denial on her lips! Let me have alms of the Queen! [He holds up his hands to her. Zarah. Rubio, dear Rubio—what were you saying —there is disaffection in the city? Nathan. They say Sabbataï is no Messiah—there must be a forerunner, the light of the morning-star must shine before the morning. Nehemiah proclaims himself this forerunner. He does not know I am Elijah, grown young to proclaim the Anointed King to all the Kings of the world and to all the peoples. Zarah. Nathan, you are that prophet; but Nehemiah is the forerunner of Sabbataï—the poor and humble Messiah who comes to make ready the great advent. He is the forerunner; we appoint him that. Nathan. Ah—guile of a woman! we shall appoint him that. We shall give him the title. Rubio. Have you noticed he makes the Master uneasy? Zarah. O Rubio, yes. Sabbataï is of so meek a spirit he doubts if he is chosen. And to doubt if one is chosen.... If he were confident as I! Rubio, in the cloister, when I was but a little stubborn thing of six, I said to the nuns, ‘I am the bride of God.’ When our Lord rose from the sea he had no higher exaltation. One can adventure all things, if it is firm in one's heart like that. [Nehemiah Cohen and his attendants approach across the court, travel-stained. Nathan. Peace, Nehemiah! [Zarah lifts the golden cymbals that hang from her girdle. Zarah. I acclaim you! I have acclaimed you long. O grief That you delayed! You are put high among The prophets: Nehemiah, you are strong; We are waiting for your voice, there is a song So soft we cannot hear it, till among The waters of the valley. Come, O Chief, Make straight the pathway for the world's belief— Prepare men on the earth for Paradise. Nehemiah. Lady, I am The Lord's forerunner; rightly you rejoice; I am the Lord's forerunner, and to death Will serve and follow him. When I shall see him, I shall determine if your lord is he. [Looking round keenly. Let him be summoned ... for he is not here. Nathan. But you cannot judge, you cannot determine. It is for our Lord to judge you and to appoint you! Nehemiah. I am not here to take favour of your Master; I am here to put your Master to the test. [Zarah has retired, but now advances with a little dish of grapes and wine—a slave follows with basin, ewer and towels. Zarah. You are weary; eat, refresh yourself. We must abide our Lord's pleasure. He will return when he will. Meanwhile, you must refresh yourself. (To attendants.) Bring water! Nehemiah (unnerved). Not you ... the slaves! Zarah. I am his Queen and you are a guest long-honoured, long-expected, long-foretold, long-waited for! (Pouring water on his feet.) He bade me honour and give you comfort. You have travelled far! Nehemiah. This lady is his wife? Zarah (laughing). Oh, if a prophet— Can you not instantly discern, and would One whom he did not honour as his spouse Stoop thus, thus condescend? Nehemiah. You are beautiful And gracious—and there women have an end. My thanks ... and pass within. Zarah. But you will eat; But you are weary, and I am your hostess. Speak to me of your journey. Nehemiah. If your lord Be true Messiah I abide your servant; If not ... Zarah. What faith You have, what knowledge! You will be his servant On the instant when you see him. You were mine On the instant when you saw me. [She offers him grapes one by one, checking him with the fruit when he strives to speak. Nathan. Dare you question, Dare you deny our holy Lord? Nehemiah (roughly and vehemently rising). Deny him! I find him not in Torah nor in Talmud. Nathan. Nor in the Sacred Kabbala? Nehemiah. The law And prophets being dumb, your Kabbala Is rhapsody— Nathan. Cristallomantia never Showed clearer what should be to the purged eyes. [Sabbataï has entered, climbing listlessly up in front of the Poles. Suddenly he rushes towards Nehemiah, catches him by the shoulders, drinks in his nature with one grip of scrutiny—and then flings him away, laughing long. Sabbataï. No, this is not Messiah—feel him, feel him! He has too hard a skin. No, he is clay, And earnestness and truth and reason—all You are acquainted with, all that you suffered. He is not chosen—see! Heaven loves the vine And leads its tendrils garlanding; Heaven feeds With butter and with honey—delicate Is Heaven's nurture. But this saviour reeks, His breath is stinking—he revolts ... uncleanly And vile his garments. Nehemiah. Do you spit on me? The scroll, the scroll! ... It is affirmed that there is prophecy— A secret prophecy that names your name. If that is proved, then you are no impostor. Show me the parchment. If it smell too old— Sabbataï. Then were the parchment false? Nehemiah. No, you are false, And no Messiah. I have knowledge of him, He is upon the road. It was revealed To me at Lemberg—thrust into my soul: My heart was eaten up With lust for the Messiah, to behold him Treading the winepress, and to tread it, tread The winepress with him. Can you tread it out? I come from massacre, from shreds and strips Of my tormented people ... where they dwell Wild beasts are ravening. Cossacks plough their way Through the furrows of my people's backs; and you Sent me sleek messages, I should have vengeance. Your message was delivered, but the Poles Told me that you were stepping, as a woman Steps, delicately; told me of your butter, Your honey and your cates. But vengeance, Vengeance must feed us! Can you give us vengeance; Say, can you tread the press? [Sabbataï looks forth blankly. Sabbataï. There must be suffering And patience and forlornness.... I will send Alms to my people—I have riches. (In a very gentle voice.) Prophet, Let us not be too vehement. In haste I am preparing to take ship and conquer The earth.... There may be rites, Ephraim Messiah, You say, must come—Ephraim with many griefs. It may be you are he. But enter! [Sabbataï goes within. Nehemiah. Vengeance Is what I seek and where the law burns red. [Showing a back of dogged hostility he moves toward the inner door through which Sabbataï has passed. Before Nehemiah has reached it, Sabbataï springs forth, a pot of clay in his arms. Sabbataï. Here is the vessel Of the sacred prophecy. [Setting down the curious old pot and plunging his hand in it. Here is the scroll, Here is the test you put.... Examine it! You Nathan, Nehemiah, you—two lawyers. Nehemiah. Old is it? I would see— Sabbataï. Sit down and wrangle. [He throws the scroll on the table; Nehemiah savagely holds it up to the light, then claws it. He fastens as an eagle on his prey.... (Turning to the sea.) I could creep off, And in a little pinnace with my harp Make melody to God and leave His billows To waft me on His pleasure.... (Bending over the puzzled, angry heads.) Sorrow! But these will never be redeemed; in strife And bitterness they wander all their days. Nehemiah (turning back to Sabbataï). The edges are too curled; The style is cramped. Where was the parchment found? Sabbataï. I do not know. The form Is of an amphora, a tawny-bowled, Dark vessel, and with wine to cheer the dead. (To Nathan.) Was it not in a tomb—do you remember? Yachini found this testament? Nehemiah. Yachini! We know him in the north. From Bosphorus He sends neat transcripts of the ancient writings For Christian use. Nathan. Out of a tomb, Closed in a den of unfrequented grass, It came, Messiah. Abraham Yachini Was moved within his entrails, deep-inspired To rending of the ancient turf. Within ... Sabbataï. Oh, let me read! (Pointing at Nehemiah.) Are you a Kabbalist? Nehemiah. Read to the people—to the French, the English, The traders from the north— And are there any Germans at your court? Read—we all listen! [He turns the pot slowly round, dipping his finger in spittle and wetting the clay, Sabbataï (reading). ‘I, Ben Abraham, Shut up for forty years within a cave, Was sorrowful, And dreaming in my slumber had no peace For wonder that the time of miracles Tarried so long, so long delayed the day Of restoration; then a voice broke forth— One shall be born and speedily, his name Is Sabbataï; he shall quell the Dragon, He is the true Messiah, He shall wage war—he shall be weaponless.’ I like this prophecy. See, Nehemiah, You must not ask for vengeance as of blood; There must be no blood-shedding. Nehemiah. But the earth Must drip with blood, the border of each garment Must bear it for a rusty hem, before The chosen people can ride forth as kings; And if you are not come to bring a sword Your coming is no more than yonder flight Of pigeons in the air. (Turning to the people.) This earth is baked— New-baked as bread for Sabbath use. This scripture Smacks too much of the common tongue. Sabbataï. It needs The Kabbala—it needs interpretation, The living breath of knowledge. What is speech Without interpretation? What is knowledge, If not the interpretation of the wise? We have about us earth and sky and ocean— We are but set in them as animals, That bark or hinny or get provender, And cannot re-create the parable, And have no inkling of the mystery Of how things shudder and impinge and draw The universe along by violence, By stealth, by signs, by deepest machination. O Nehemiah, you are crude— Nehemiah. The Scriptures Are crude ... I know not; they are honest scriptures. This is a forgery. I tear it up Before you all, I tread it underfoot, I spit on it. [There are howls of execration. Nehemiah is roughly handled—the Sabbataïans close round him. Sabbataï. What beasts are these, what beasts! Unloose the prophet, Set him aside! I challenge His liberty, I challenge all men's acts. This earthen pot is of a thousand years Or is of yesterday—all evidence Is false, all knowledge of the nature Of the dew or of the manna on the ground. My Kings, I have taken heart! [Flinging the earthen pot away. We will adventure Our mystery at once—we will put forth, You, my musicians, you, my mariners, And to the sound of music will set sail; With ritual will receive the Soldan's crown. (To Nathan.) Marshal my Kings—advance! I am Messiah. Within the uttermost places of the sea I prayed; there was I wrought, and, being human, Wrought into God; the Name was wrought in me. You say I spoke it—that was chance, the action Was irresistible, was as the waves That rise and chafe and must be waves against The wind and rocks, but in themselves are silent As the sea's floor of sand. I am Messiah. The waves supported me; there was my faith. I am Messiah. Men may write false scriptures: I am Messiah! I commend myself Once more to the great sea. The Law is done, The Law is cast away and by new tracks The very stars are guided. I believe! Stream with me to the sea.... That heretic, The verjuice of dissension, that maligner— A pest, a Gog or Magog, a shame-faced, Convicted leper—oh, escape from him, As I escape.... Musicians, there is scent Of the sea upon my garments. Zarah (at his feet). There is scent And fragrance of the sea. Sabbataï. Follow me, follow! Children, I know not whither we shall sail. The music is more distant, but it leaps. I have knowledge of the sailing; of the port; I have no further knowledge—Follow me! [They all gather to Messiah. He leads them in procession down the steps to the harbour. The musicians descend last singing. Musicians. Hail, all hail To the golden sail, Hail to the Mariner that has no port, To the King that has no crown. Hail to the spirits free, Stretching their sail to the limitless sea! The hautboys, the shawms and rebecks, the trumpets' snort, The triumph, the laughter, the scorn Round the skiff forlorn Of the golden sail! Down, down, Follow the King that has no crown, Follow the sail, Follow the light of its wings on the gale, Till the night come and the glory fail. [All pass out except Nahan Ghazati, who picks up the fragments of the scroll and the potsherds close to Nehemiah. Nehemiah. Hot youth, remain with me. Nathan. Are you Messiah? [Facing Nehemiah, who has turned to leave the courtyard in the opposite direction to the harbour. Where are you going? Do you think to do him a mischief—and he has given you your life and liberty? But you shall not betray him to the Turk—dog!—you shall not. [Nehemiah springs aside from the flash of Nathan's dagger—then runs across the court, a fugitive. Nehemiah. There shall be no false Messiah. I see at last what I am. I have business with the Cadi. [Nathan stares after him, grasping the tattered scroll to his breast, his feet bleeding from the potsherds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III Scene I Constantinople. The Harbour. A great half-moon has cut its descending pathway through white fog, on which masts, with furled sails, make, as it were, a bowed forest, leaning one way. To the left is the Custom-house, a low building of unpainted wood, with high palisades going down to the water, and patrolled by officers. To the right a camel kneels to be loaded. Officers and soldiers keep coming to and fro from the Custom-house and the last vessel on the right, which is just come to land. Officers (among themselves as they pass). We must wait the Soldan's orders. Hosts of people Press round the barrier. See, that peaked-up turban! Even jewels are flung over round our heels. Mustapha Pasha joined the prison-ship Just off the Dardanelles. He is within, Conversing with this traitor. Listen, listen, listen! A wail of voices! Every day, all day A wail of voices! Day by day the tempest Has kept at sea the Infidels' great Prophet. ‘Is he coming, is he coming?’ was our jeer. The wail of voices— He is come. A traitor, Conspiring for the crown, and yet our Soldan Would have us treat him with all courtesy. From the Vessel. A further guard! Chief Officer. Enter! The Captain beckons. Enter! [Cries: there is a press of Custom-house officials to the ship. Through them Sabbataï and his jailer Seid come guarded. Seid. Sit there. Sabbataï (seating himself on an old chest). I shall be glad to sit. How sick I feel, Oh, I feel ceremoniously unclean! It is wrong to feel such nausea at the light. And so this is Stamboul—the Soldan's city. It lies a coil of chains about the bays. [Pointing to a height above the Custom-house. And what is that? Seid. Oh, nothing! A little execution on the hill. It is the hour. Sabbataï. No, not for men to die. They should die with the light, die at the sunset. Seid. Prophet, then you shall change all this, And men shall die at a more cordial hour. There must be executions of deserters, Renegades, unbelievers: I shall watch them At sunset.... You will make me of your household When you are Soldan? I believe in you. Remember— Sabbataï. You dear Seid! [He touches his jailer's arm caressingly. If I am Soldan ... that must be to-night. It is impossible—sweet rush of flame! What is that murmur, Seid? [Rising with dilated nostrils. Do I not know it? Is it not the burthen Of my people? Seid. Surely. [Mustapha Pasha by the vessel signs to Seid: they speak together. Sabbataï. How it wanes, it waxes. Eternal, I am Chosen of the Earth! I had oblations, sacrifice wherever I touched the land, a prisoner! My vessel Was bravely trimmed; I grew to hate the trappings, I grew to hate the homage, but persistent The miracles surrounded me: each day The prophecies fulfilled themselves like hours. (A young Turkish officer stands in front of him with unapproving eyes. Officer. Art thou Messiah? Sabbataï. Verily I am. [He lifts his face and smiles. Officer (instantaneously). You are, you are ... [He turns on his heel. Sabbataï. O God, O my Desire, why is it that I worship Each little impulse in the sand, each striving? I know the sea In its foundation. Thou didst hold me clasped, Ice-clasped beneath its winter; in that world, Eternal, I was with thee and I rose Creative from thy hand. Oh, by thy name stamped on my breath and uttered Apparent as a writing on the wall— For my lips moved not and I made no sound, As the great sea-birds drew themselves together And rested in high pyramid above— Do not abandon me, do not desert me! I cannot draw the people from their faith, Yet cannot pray. ... How acrid cold it is! (Faintly to Seid who approaches). A cup of coffee! Seid. In the Custom-house They are drinking—I will fetch you one. [The moon falls into the sea and a long streak of rose steals from the East. Enter Zarah conducted from the ship. As she comes forward the guard retires a short distance. Sabbataï. Beloved, You are the morning, and your brilliancy Shows me more wan. You are arrayed a Queen. Zarah. Assuredly. And you—how like a King I have beheld you as the unrolling clouds Unrolled their vision to you and discovered The palace-roof that will be yours to-night. Sabbataï. There, there!—I left you sleeping, A little pearl of health upon your cheek, Health in your dreams ... [She strokes his forehead. My hour is come. Sit down, Sit by me, Zarah—see, there is a chest; And we are King and Queen. They guard us closely.... Give me your hand. This little fountain-pulse In the hollow of your hand! You are exalted. Zarah. Belovèd, but your hands are ice of ice. Sabbataï. They must not quiver when I seize the crown. (Rising.) I must prepare, I must make ready: there is nothing ready, Nothing prepared. Seid (approaching with coffee). A miracle Never has prelude. Sabbataï. Are you turned Messiah, And do you know the trick? (To Zarah.) Why do you walk in jewels? Zarah. Does it displease you? Ill-humoured, Sabbataï, on your day Of triumph, my great day? Sabbataï. I am very sick. [Seid urges him to drink coffee. Seid. See, how the dawn advances, how the city Reddens and whitens, and the minarets Have each the little cloud of their own smoke! Sabbataï (setting down the cup). I am better—more Messiah now. O Seid, This city is a golden bride before me, And I am amorous—such strange, fantastic, Terrible, smothered beauty. Zarah. All these turrets Will crumble as the walls of Jericho Before the trump of God and his Elect. Sabbataï. Break off, break off! It is not so that it will come to pass. O beautiful, my city! Zarah. Sabbataï, Your kings ... [The royal followers of Sabbataï are conducted past him in chains. Sabbataï. They pass as phantoms of great kings, And all their caravan a huge mirage. (To the kings.) I will not further test your faith, O kings, I have given you dominion, ye are lords Of Judah, Persia, Araby, Italia— You shall all reign on thrones when the Messiah Walketh among you: that has been my promise. This day it is fulfilled. [The kings pass dejected. Do they believe? Their faces are all turned away from me, They cannot tell how it shall come to pass, For there will be a great astonishment Before the evening star. [The mariners pass guarded. My mariners! The stubborn happy faces. My mariners, I shall not cross the sea, Never again—but you have made the voyage Once with the golden sails. Were you not happy? Will there not be a music in your ears, Ye who make war and carry merchandise; A sound that ye have won the victory, And know your treasure lying at the port? Speak to me! Mariners. Heigh, a'heigh! [They pass. Sabbataï. I can do this thing, I can, I shall. That score of glowing faces! [Primo and Nathan pass. Primo. O Master, by the Name! Nathan. Malka Kadisha! Now what should be is come, invincible. Hosanna! [They pass out. Sabbataï. The musicians? [Rubio passes. Zarah. Rubio! [He blows on his fingers. Rubio, he will give us all the world, As he gave you once a shekel. [Rubio still blows on his fingers. Sabbataï. The musicians? [Mustapha Pasha strolls forward. I must have music.... I want it in my limbs. Seid, the musicians! Mustapha. Your Queen is sent for from the Seraglio, and your delicious singing-girls, the Soldan's women that have been your wives. Bid farewell. Sabbataï. Protect her. Mustapha. She is under protection of his exalted Majesty. Zarah. I am safe as in God's bosom, Sabbataï. Awake, beloved, awake! [She is led out with the other women. Sabbataï. I must have music. The players on the instruments Have not passed by? Mustapha. They are within the vessel, A band of eunuchs will be sent to fetch them To the Seraglio. Sabbataï. I would see the Soldan. Mustapha. Patience! We still await the royal guard. [He goes into the Custom-house. Sabbataï. Seid, fetch me biscuits.... I have little power, If I should famish ... all the fire falls out. A pound or two ... if they should famish me, You saw it, I grow sad. [Seid slips away. Sabbataï gazes dreamily in a tide pool. The little emerald minnows.... How beautiful! [He ceases to watch the pool and is arrested by the barricade. A hand comes holding a piece of coral; then some dates are thrown over with a thud on the ground: later, a costly handkerchief is raised on a stick, but flutters down on the further side. My people! [Seid returns. Seid. Master! the biscuits—swift! [Sabbataï stuffs them in his wide Turkish trousers. Mustapha Pasha! [Mustapha re-enters. Mustapha. Are you disturbed? [Some one sings in Hebrew from the crowd. You have made the people happy, you have made the Soldan unhappy—we must reverse all this. Sabbataï. Conduct me to the Soldan. Mustapha. It is early yet. On rising his exalted Majesty receives you. Smoke! Sabbataï. I will smoke with you. [Mustapha Pasha seats himself on the other chest. Sabbataï smokes the offered chibouque in silence. Mustapha. Doubtless he brews charms. How the delay is harassing him—how his eyebrows twitch! (His tongue in his cheek.) Are you Messiah? Sabbataï. O sir, you will comprehend—the people rate me thus. Mustapha. And you have not conspired against the Soldan? The city is about you as you were lord of the city, and you have a retinue of kings. Sabbataï (laughing softly). They have not armour nor bright weapons, nor chains heavy as these chains. They can inflict no punishment. Mustapha. The base knave deserts his followers! —what are you then, what trade do you follow? And what meant those fancy ships in the harbour of Smyrna, with their silken sails? Were they laden with treasure for the Soldan? Do you acknowledge him and do you bear him tribute; do you bear him slaves and singing-girls? Sabbataï. I have sailed in the mystic vessel. I was about to sail. The Cadi of Smyrna has in nothing thwarted my purpose. Mustapha (laughing uncomfortably). In nothing! You sailed with your kings, with your delicious singing-girls, with your train of beggars, with your refuse and scum of the nations you deceived.... [The camel rises that has been loading from the vessel. We have transported the greater part of your pageantry. Look, little master, that has all been accumulated by you for the Soldan. It is tribute, you will have honoured welcome. [A shipload of slaves is being landed from another vessel; they are marched past under the whip. Is he mad? What excites him, what has he seen? Is it the camel that drops with his golden throne? The camel drops and the chair is broken. Bah! and such a trophy! [He turns to the little crowd gathered about the struggling camel. The slaves are driven up the shore. One of them struck by the whip, stretches her arms toward Sabbataï, who has risen with such violent agitation, he breaks his chains. Sabbataï (lifting his freed arms). If to this band, I am indeed Thy Chosen. [After a while his hands drop. They pass.... My chains are broken off. O Seid, Go after them ... Seid. Dear Master, But this is not the miracle. The slaves Must pass in fetters. Any slave you choose To-night is yours; but now— The moment! Oh, consider and take thought Of your own Majesty. [A captain with a band of Spahis enters through the Custom-house door. Mustapha Pasha turns to receive the soldiers. I am his jailer: I have not freed him, and behold him free. [A stripling is lifted up by the crowd to overlook the court. Mustapha. He is a prophet! The Captain. And it is the hour ... [Suddenly the barricade is broken down. Voices. He has freed himself! He is Messiah—we In his power have broken free! [The Spahis form against the people, flashing their weapons. Sabbataï (looking at the people). You must not follow me. Go home! Continue To wait for the Messiah—a long hope, As hope for the Eternal must be long. Go home! Wherever I am, ye are my bread in banishment, My secret fountain: I am fed of you, My people—in the desert I am yours. Go home! [He watches the mournful crowd passing back through the broken barricade. Seid (touching his elbow). The Soldan— Sabbataï. Ah, I had forgotten! The Soldan—he is nothing.... I am nothing. But I will pray for these; and as Messiah I will pray for them. I am their Messiah, And they have broke my chains. [He watches them still as obediently they disappear: then he turns to the infidels. My jailer! You, (To Mustapha.) Be mute of this; and give me a full guard. [He listlessly heads the little company of Spahis, followed by the captain, Seid, and Mustapha Pasha. Scene II Constantinople. The Court of the Soldan. White and red alternate arches make a semicircle in the midst of which a dim carpet, beyond price, is suspended behind the throne of the Soldan: a similar carpet is stretched at the foot. Between every arch a black eunuch stands like a bronze grotesque. The Soldan Mohammed iv. is crowned and robed in state. On one side of him stands the Mufti Vanni, on the other the Grand Vizir, Ahmed Coprili. Nehemiah Cohen kneels before him dressed as a Turk in green robe and white turban. The Soldan. You are seeking vengeance ... Nehemiah. Even as the lord Mahommed Would ever with the sword, Ever with vengeance, smite God's enemies. The Soldan. You are seeking vengeance: and our throne is safe. Eh, Mufti Vanni? Nehemiah. While a Jew receives The tribute of all lands—Egypt, Morocco, Italy, Holland, Austria ...? The Soldan (nudging the Mufti Vanni). And by night Dreams thievishly of putting on my crown To the flourish of his trumpets and his shawms. We will receive him With honour as a mystic traveller, Suppled with divinations to attract And hurry our desires to our feet. Nehemiah (rising). He is an arch-corrupter: Moslem drink Forbidden wine, Jews eat forbidden flesh, And sacred fasts are loosened from their dearth. Grand seignior, ever clement to our race, Though I have bitter wrongs, I am not pleading Their vengeance—I reveal a secret plot, Remote, widespread, yet beating at your doors, To dispossess your sacred Majesty. The Soldan. A charmer— A little ill-famed Jew of such account! Is the man mad? Is he beloved as madmen Who free their passion to a million hearts That whirl the frantic dance in unison? If so ... Ahmed Coprilli, tell me Do you find the city moved? Coprili. My lord, O Soldan, The city is in motion: love so surges At this expected advent of a prophet Called by the Jews Messiah. The Soldan. Troublesome Are chatterers with titles! Nehemiah. Ho, but this man is silent In such a way that all pronounce his name And his seditious honours on the breath Of his stupendous silentness. The Soldan. Still waters, They say, run deep. Do you find the crowd's commotion Profound or shallow, Ahmed? Coprili. It is inward, At crisis: for the people Are moved by wonder and belief in wonder, So that a storm is simply held in leash By admiration. The Soldan. If we torture him, Preluding death ... Coprili, My lord, O Soldan, death Would loose the currents of disturbance, resting At poise on wonder—death Is peril to your throne. Delay his death. Nehemiah. Kill him, O Soldan. Allah bless the deed, And Allah's prophet! In the solitude Of walls and distance from your feverish streets, Whip him with flaming scourges, Impale him mid-most of mid-palace courts, Let him die gagged, and howling through his mind His body's anguish. The Mufti Vanni. Son of wisdom, listen In no wise to this Jewish convertite, Whose tooth for Allah's enemies is ranker Than mine, even mine. Before the penalty Of execution on a criminal, Let us, if so we may, Convert this mad, seditious person. Urge him With reasons, bribe him.... You are paymaster Worth a knave's tale: or threaten him—you strike Far deeper with a menace than with sentence. Smile on the culprit, beat him with the frown That opens pinion on your brow at whiles; Point to the executioners, demand The Adan. Kill this mad, seditious person, His teaching and his followers will remain. If we can bring him into Islam, then He is discredited from alien homage, Mohammed is enlarged and Allah praised. [While the Mufti Vanni has been speaking the Chief of the Eunuchs has ushered in musicians who stand in a half-circle on each side of the Soldan's throne, tuning their instruments. A Eunuch sweeps aside the curtain. The Soldan. Our visitor is in the doorway. Allah! This little, black-garbed creature is God's prophet! ... Handsome.... The eyes attempt our sympathy With the first glance. Sabbataï enters Lay cushions for our guest. Sabbataï. I do not know the reverences due To the grand seignior. I would keep all forms To his exalted Majesty. The Chief Eunuch. Salaam Three times. [Sabbataï does as bidden. The Soldan. Be seated, Sabbataï Zevi, Unless (With a smile.) You would approach me to my face, And lift this symbol from my head. Musicians, You see, are at your service, if you choose The air that shall discrown me. There are shawms, Trumpets wide-mouthed, and harps and psalteries too! Also I am awaiting you. My circlet Is very rich—its gems surpass your jewels. Add them to yours, charming successor! Snatch them! Hear! All the instruments are tuning. Come, The tune, your hands about my head!... ... A guest, His countenance shows us unmannerly To listen to such tales as folk will spin At the street corners, at the harbour moorings. (To the musicians.) Hush, hush! Your thrills are inconvenient, Our audience given to Sabbataï Zevi Will not, it seems, be musical. [At a waft of his hands the drooping musicians are conducted out. Sweet doctor Of strange religion, are you the Messiah The Jews await? Believe me I would learn. Sabbataï (from his cushions). If there are any oracles within The human spirit of true voice, I was. The Soldan. But now, now in our presence? [Sabbataï is silent. You confess Imposture by your silence. Sabbataï (half to himself). Once a Rabbi Laughed at the jackals round the holy ruins, The ruins of Jerusalem: he knew The desolation must all come to pass Before the promise. The Soldan. Then you are Messiah? Sabbataï (sitting forward, with waving hands). I was called—and I have waited for the sign. So I was called that marvels have been done About me—all the countries have been living Heart against my heart; all the countries—England, And Germany and Spain—all far away, Have quivered with my ecstasy. O Soldan, I was not born to glory, but the coffers Of merchant cities, outpoured at my feet, Have made me boundless in magnificence. A messenger come from Jerusalem, To bear repentant homage to me, staggered Beneath the salver of rewarding coins. In all ways I have lived as you are living, The graces of command on every moment, The splendour of an empire on each day. The sun has looked upon my pageantry; The moon has whitened palaces Where I have slept; the stars across the darkness Have not outnumbered those that worship me. With chains about my wrists, I have lured forth of men their eagerness To give me gifts, to listen to the message Which is the message I am called of God. The very sea has crouched as a meek dog Beneath my prayer. Is it not marvellous? Tell me, O Soldan! And the prophets come Within the limit of my hallowed vision— The antique prophets. I have beheld Elijah with these eyes, Antique Elijah risen up: And men have seen live fire upon my forehead, They have heard rhythmical upon my voice, Disturbing awe, the Name no man may utter. O Soldan, surely I was called of God. The Soldan. See, Mufti Vanni, here is radiance—beauty Become persuasion, beauty On common lineaments a smile, on these A light that opens. Sabbataï Zevi, You have a voice that pleases; I would hear it When sleeping on my cushions after prayer. Your hands are exquisite and delicate; They draw hallucination with their swaying, Till trust in you is as a mystery. You are persuaded of yourself and half Your lustre and attraction win the slackness Even of my credence ... but I need a sign. (To the Chief Eunuch.) Order my archers in.... (To Sabbataï.) Nay, do not rise, My guest, my fellow Sultan; at your leisure Wait the proposal of my thought. [The archers are ushered in. Archers, your weapons tense for action! (To the Chief Eunuch.) Range them Half-circled like our Golden Horn without. [They stand on each side the throne, their bows bent. Now Sabbataï Zevi, if indeed You are of God, substantially divine, Allow my eunuchs freedom To strip you and my archers to let loose Their arrows on your body. I demand A miracle, with flesh and blood for proof. Then if the level flight of missiles turn From drinking at their aim, and if you stand With silver face of light that opens—Soldan Mohammed is your subject King, and lowly Takes off his crown in silence to your power; He owns the Jews' religion and Messiah. Rise, you have yet your diadem to win. Rise! [Sabbataï does as bidden. Eunuchs strip him! [As they advance, Sabbataï covers his face, praying. Sabbataï. O my God, my God, Descend on me invulnerable, show me Thy Chosen.... Do not leave me here alone. Do not forsake me! [He suddenly uncovers his eyes and fixes them wide on the archers. All the Moslems breathe low and bend forward. His lips move and he recoils. (Under his breath.) Arrows ... but the points.... And who shall stay them? [The Eunuchs begin to remove his clothes. No, no, no! Do not bare me, God-forsaken ... not that shame! The Soldan. Confess, you have blasphemed—or take your choice To bid my archers—shoot. [There is profound silence, then a sob is heard. You have blasphemed. [With a creak all the arrows are unstrung and the archers begin to laugh as they see the Soldan laugh. At the sound of the jeers Sabbataï presses his breast as if struck, while he weeps with closed eyes. Our beauty is in cloud! O man, confess Allah is great. Where are your wonders now? The false compulsion of your shining? Dusk Is on the air we breathe. Allah is great. A cloud is over us, O man! Nehemiah. Where falls The branch there it shall lie. The Soldan. What would you tell us? Sabbataï. Let me go forth.... There are many seas around.... To wander in the heat ... The Soldan. You are condemned. You stand here a blasphemer, proved Deep in imposture. There is punishment For these offences, and to them is added Sedition. I condemn you, and exact Another miracle. Sabbataï (lifting his hands). Drag me no more Amid the dogs and mire! A miracle! Have you not laughed that all was as it was. A miracle! The Soldan. One that a man may do. You must confess Mohammed. Sabbataï. I refuse. If I refuse ...? The Soldan. At the Seraglio gate The stake is planted that shall raise you up To die, that handsome head left without mercy To brood upon the agony it tops. Before extremity of punishment You will be flogged with torch-twined rods that scorch you, And sting together, Then you will lament You kept my archers idle. Sabbataï. Renegade! The Soldan. Forsaken of your God!... Your lips are white as the door of the Mosque at Eyoub. Sabbataï. The archers.... Their arrows! [Again the half-circle laughs. The Soldan. You are weak to dream of pity. Neither a sword nor arrows, but the stake, And fiery rods to goad your nakedness. Sabbataï. I am so weary. What do you desire? That I should change religion for religion, My race for yours? Is it a Turk you ask I should become? The Soldan. Please God! Sabbataï. I am alone In all the lands, among all peoples.... (Falling on the cushions.) And even In death I shall go down in it alone. Outcast! The Soldan. The woman— Your Queen—will suffer deep in solitude, When you are raised upon the pike—her death Strangling, and the way to death a rack. [Sabbataï springs up with a maddened gesture, and rends the hem of his black robe. Sabbataï. My God.... My people! The dream, the dream! Savage—this place—this crowd, this foreign country Where I have no existence ... The Soldan. Sabbataï, We worship the one God; the antique prophets Are to the Turk as to the Jew. Rich state has been about you: my rich state Surrounds my servants and my wealth is theirs In no unstinted measure. I am held A generous paymaster. You please me well, And often through the hours I would encounter Your gentle and imperious face. Sabbataï (glancing sidelong at the Soldan). I lived Too softly.... [He laughs. Foolish dreams!—Will you employ me?... Hou! [He groans and begins to shiver. The Soldan. Wisdom, Sabbataï, Controls all discord in the bounds of Fate: The inevitable should be calm. [Sabbataï stands irresolute. (To Mufti Vanni.) A mystic, But now an unbeliever, and the mind Only a sorrowing sport of vacancy!— Listen! [From the minarets of the city comes the cry of the Muézzin. Voices. God is great: there is no God but God: Mahommed is God's prophet. (The Soldan's prayer-mat is spread; he and all his Court murmur the midday prayers. Sabbataï is arrested. Then a look, at once frightened and profound, comes into his face: he bows his head and prostrates himself. When the prayers are over Sabbataï still remains prostrate. The Soldan (returning to his throne). The Jew has prayed with us. Rise, Sabbataï. [Sabbataï does as bidden. Sabbataï. God is great: there is no God but God: Mohammed is his prophet. [Throwing down his black Jewish turban, he stands as if a burthen had been loosed from him. The Soldan. Praise to Allah! Now let the cloak of green and the white turban Clothe him entire for our religion, make him Compatriot and fellow-worshipper. Ah, you think well. Mohammed is God's prophet, Attested by the ages, by the wonders Of death-like trance, by faith that wove God's glory Through life unbroken. Be my doorkeeper. You shall not lack gold: as you will, your wages In any kind my treasurer shall pay. And I shall see you often as I pass. You will receive the turban, the green mantle— Will you not? Sabbataï. Yes, exalted Majesty. [They dress him as a Turk. The Soldan. Will you receive of me your Turkish name, My choosing? Sabbataï. Yes, exalted Majesty. The Soldan. Mehmed Effendi—and a favourite. The Mufti Vanni. Mehemed Effendi, I will teach you in the Mosque The true religion of God's chosen prophet, In my Mosque ‘The Splendour.’ Allah's be all praise! The Soldan. Your wife shall be restored—Fauma Effendi Her name: she shall have presents From the Sultana's hand. [He rises and moves down the room. Open the curtain. Await her. Sabbataï. Yes, exalted Majesty. The Soldan. Be happy in my service! Half a saint, May the Great Prophet give you Heaven at last! Sabbataï (his hand on the curtain). What am I? On the branches of Life's Tree Are many apples sound and beautiful. If I am dropped and lie beneath the shadows, Who glowed once in the sun, still other apples Burthen the boughs. I should be comforted, Laid safe within the shadow. God is great, And glows and ripens on His favourites, As this Mohammed. I will give God praise. [White as death, he holds the curtain while the Soldan passes, and taps his cheek, and gives him a nod and smile of approbation. Nehemiah, unseen, stoops, picks up Sabbataï's black turban and hides it under his green cloak. When the Court has passed out, Sabbataï drops the curtain and turns back into the room, facing the Soldan's throne. Am I not praising God, praising His prophet, And taking on His partiality? And yet I could have praised God in a way More perfect, if my heart were not confused. I could (widely extending his arms) have taken the arrows in a sheaf, And fallen and left the arrows for His choice, And for His judgment over me—my God! [He buries his face; then suddenly looks out at the Church of St. Sophia, visible against the sky. How bright the Cross is burning on yon dome! God favoured that sad Prophet. Very gladly I would have died to be accepted so. How should I die? I had no part in dying, I was called onward by a crown of sapphires. To lure my people to their happiness Was my sole task, sole strain. But God is great, Mohammed is His prophet. God be praised! [He sinks down on the cushions, and, closing his eyes, breathes as if asleep. Eunuchs shamble about. After a while a tall, black Eunuch opens the curtain and Zarah enters. Zarah. Wake, Sabbataï. We are dreaming. Help me! Sabbataï (with closed eyes). I cannot. God is great. I testify Mohammed is His prophet. Zarah. Sabbataï, You have betrayed me. Sabbataï (opening his eyes). I am like a woman Who dreamt she was beloved, and to the core Of a lover's heart; who made this dream her life, Breathing it with the secrecy of breathing; Who found.... But, O belovèd, as that woman You are not. You are all to me, my chosen! Will you be even as God, and cast me off? [Zarah lets her long hair fall over his feet as she kisses them. He looks out with wide, dreaming eyes. If God should cling thus—if this woe should be The land of Egypt, the Captivity!</field>
