      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS MAIESTIE. Sir, To wait on YOU, the Persian MIRZA'S come From the fair shades of his Elizium: If all the wrongs that's Innocence opprest Obtain one sigh from YOUR heroick Breast, He'l think them ga[illeg.], having preferr'd Him to YOUR Royall Knowledges and perhaps done so More then his Birth-right bad; for he hopes now Not onely to delight, but profit YOU, In warning to eschew what spoild his Right, The Flatterer, and too powerfull Favourite. In old Time, sacred was the Poets Pen, And usefull to eternize worthy men: To Rescue Vertue from the Furies spight, And lift her Palm the higher for the weight. And I could wish it the next Ages Song, Had MIRZA not die'd, He'd not liv'd so long: His (written) Ghost looks brighter in his Bay Then He had in the Crown of Persia. So shall it be: Gain from His Losse shall flow, And Life from Death, if YOU, Great SIR, say so. Baron,</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Upon the incomparable Tragedy called Mirza, written by my dear Friend Mr. Robert Baron. Advance Great Mirza, let the base world see Vertue is Vertue though in misery. Convince her of her madnesse, let her know Goodnesse does still attend thee, high or low; And that, which prosperous, wrought thy hate &amp; scorn, Commands our Adoration when forlorn. Vertue's no Vertue while it lives secure, When difficulty waits on't then 'tis pure. The morning of thy life which soar'd so high In acts of Valour Crown'd with Majesty, Had nere attain'd that glorious pitch and height, Hadst thou not falne a sacrifice at night; This fall of thine thy Fame doth much advance, And death thy valuation doth enhance. So have I seen a much lamented herse When 'twas departing, all bepinn'd with Verse. And from the selfe same channell issuing forth The livers sorrow, and the dead Mans worth; 'Tis this which makes us write, that 't may be known Vertue is highly priz'd, though overthrown. We mourn thy loss, admire thy worth, and grieve Our Isle a Mirz' and Allybeg can give. Thus Text and Time doe sute, and whilst you tell Your Tale, wee'l easily find a Parallell. Jo. Quarles; Fell. of Pet. House Camb.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the most Ingenious Master ROBERT BARON, On his Masterpiece of Tragedy. PHYTHAGORAS sang truth, souls shift we see For IOHNSON'S transmigrated into Thee: Or if that Doctrines false, thy glory's more Without his helpes to equal, whom before We thought Sans peer: both are so very well, So like, as mix them, and you cannot tell Me which is which. Thou Fame enough hast won, Thy name is up, now maist thou lie till Noon, And rest thy strong Muse, having equall'd him Whom sharpest wits did our best Poet deem: I know thy Judgment's more then t'aim ought higher, Thou mightest as well hope to drown PHOEBUS Lyre; Yet write again, till all the world's agree'd Thy PEGASUS has breath as well as speed. Mean time, who'l number our best Playes aright First CATALINE, then let him MIRZA write, So mix your names: in the third place must be SELANUS, or the next that comes from thee. RO. HILLS Esq;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the best accomplish'd Author. Thankes noble Friend, thou hast given us a Play This Age deserves not pray Heaven the next may, A Play said I, I erre to call it so, 'Tis a laborious work, a great one too, A work to which scarce even the ablest brain So well, but in a wish could ere attain; So passing well it is as I no higher Can ever hope to reach at then t'admire, To praise I need not strive, since Praisers thou Enough hast, though none it can praise enough. JO. CARY, M. A.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To the Author. When I read yours (dear friend) I seem'd to see In Persia acted this sad Tragedie, But might we see it acted on the Stage ABBAS in his, and MIRZA in his rage Transported beyond pitty, and the love Of Parents, then (O then) how it would move! For then, transfixt, men should not onely see, But should refent with such a Sympathy As might extract a deluge from their eyes. Persia would then seem but in theories To Personate what you to life have dawn, MELPOMENE was there but in the drawn, Here in full splendors. There spectators shead But onely tears, yours acted, would strike dead. Else, Stoick like, say there's an Apathie, And that compassion is turn'd NIOBE. No Marvail, since to her there have been shown So many Tragick Acts, you bring but one, But such a sprightfull one, that you may dare To own what your name speaks, Born to be rare. E. MANNYNG.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument. Abbas King of Persia, already flesht in blood (as having made his way to the Crown by the murder of his eldest Brother, the compleatly valiant Emir-hamze-mirza, and posting his purblind Father MAHOMET Codoband into Paradise) grows jealous (so justly fearful are guilty minds) of his only (legitimate) Son, and indubitable heir, the victorious Mirza, who (while he had the command of his Fathers Armies) having much enlarged the Persian Territories (by his acquests from the Mogull, towards Candahor, fom the Arabian, near to Balsora, and the Tartar, east of the Hyrcanian Sea) grew great in the love and admiration of the people. This jealousie (of its self, a blood thirsty passion, more cruel then the Grave) irritated by some Cabinet Councellours, enemies to the Prince about the King, begat in him a fear of the Princes growth, that, a resolve to strangle him; which to effect securely, that is closely, he trains him from his Army, by dispatching a Post down to him (then sweating in blood, to redeem the honour of his Country-men against the Turk) with command to hast up to Court, where he should know his pleasure. The Prince (being subject to that only disadvantage of honest hearts credulity) assures his Army of his quick return, and hasts (so bold is innocence) to attend his Father, from whom he is met by a Messenger, certifying him, that the King, being by reason of some indisposition of health, unfit for businesse, willed him to repose where that servant should carry him, till himself came to welcome him. The credulous Prince (like other upright persons, fearing no hurt because he meant none) follows his guide to his appointed lodgings, whereinto (so soon as that false servant was departed) enter, at a trap door, seven lusty villains, deaf and dumb, armed with Bowstring and bloody minds, whose habit and weapons needed no other interpreters to assure the amazed Prince that he was betrayed, and sealed to destruction. Oratory was in vain, they were deaf in soul and body, (and this perhaps is the Reason why the Turks and Persians use to employ Mutes in these bloody offices) resistance was bootless, he being single, and unarmed; yet (resolving not to go unattended to the Grave) with such weapons at his Rage and Sorrow yeelded him; he flew upon them, offending them all by rare force and agility, a long time preventing the noozes to fasten on him, which they threw incessantly towards his neck, so that he sent three of them to the Devil, the other four reinforced their violence, and at last fastned on him, who, quite spent with rage and opposals fell down, as dead. The Canibals pursue their cruel cowardize, and had surely finished their intent, had not the King (who was a private spectator) toucht with some remorse, stepped forth, and commanded only that his tired Arms should be pinnion'd; and ere he had fully recovered his senses, made an hot flaming steel be drawn before his eyes, which (though giving no great pain) yet took away his eye-sight, forever forbidding him any more sight of what he loved, Wife, Children, Friends, and endeared Souldiers. Then was he cast into Prison, together with his Lady, an Arabian Princess, of the best endowments, and their young Son Soffie, born to a brighter fortune. Thus by the excessive impiety of an unnatural Father, has Asia lost her chiefest Jewel, Mars his Darling, and Persia her incomparable Treasure; at once undone, blind, imprisoned, and hopeless of any joy or honour ever after; the cruel remembrance of which, soon drave the inraged Prince into madness, and thirst of revenge, all the effects whereof were frequent with him, till his afflicted friends and officers flocked about him, and dictated patience, which they bettered by relating their own quondam greatness in blood and offices, till by the same dislike, and mutability of King Abbas his humours they were degraded, trod upon, mutilated, some their eyes put out, some their ears and noses cut off, others captivated, and near famished, so truly said it is Solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris. The grand enemy to the Prince, that infatuated King Abbas to this cruelty, was Mahomet-ally-beg his principall favourite, a person raised to that height from so obscure a descent, that he knew no further then his Father; yet (like most mean men hoisted to extraordinary preferment,) he grew so over ambitious, as to aim at the Crown; in order to which design, his first care was to remove the Prince, the Bulwark and Palladium of Persia, and his family; next, to disband the Kings Armies, what dishonourable condititions soever were granted to the Turk, that no ready forces should be left to oppose him when he should break out. One of his Instruments to besot the King to this, was one of his Concubines, whom he knew to be strong in his affections; so dangerous Serpents are they in the bosomes of Princes. The Kings unfortunate credulity, gave Ally-beg a pretence specious enough to take Arms, as but to obtain the Government of the young Prince Soffie, and to assure the people of his safety against the dangerous anger of his jealous Grandfather: So essential a beginning of all rebellions, is a smooth and fair pretence either of Reformation or safety. But here a while leave we Allybeg brooding over his design, corrupting the great, buying the needy, and fawning upon all; especially insinuating with the discontented, who are ever ready to rebell. In these unpleasant times, the King, (moving like Saturn in the highest Orbe) stood free and firm against all storms, giving himself all the variety of pleasures; but none took him so much, as the beauty and pretty discourse he observed in Fatyma, daughter to his blinded and inraged Son; which little Lady he took into his Court for his pastime; and though not above seven years old, she so captivated his doating mind, with her blooming, yet commanding Graces, that nothing relished well without Fatyma, none gave him mirth save Fatyma, and if inraged against any, no better reconcilement then by Fatyma; whom, when aged two years more, he had an intent to marry with an Arabian King. Nor had King Abbas alone, all the favour and benefit of this little Princess; for though she had all possible pleasure at the Court, yet neglected she no part of duty, but came very often into the Cittadel to joy her Parents, and relieve their wants; for none, save she, durst ask the King for their allowances, without apparent danger of displeasure, and life withall; whereby the royal, but most miserable prisoners, were sometimes near famished, none daring to relieve them, lest the jealous King might have them in suspition. Thus by this child of virtue, and innocence, gained they what they pined for, food and comfort. But behold the effects of mad melancholy! it exasperates the blinded Prince to this strange resolve: He hearing of the immoderate joy and pleasure that the King his father took in his little Grandchild Fatyma, being incapable of obtaining any better revenge, vowes to rob him of that his Darling, though he wounded him through his own sides: So strong and so sweet a passion is Revenge. So that one time, when his sad Wife and Son were sitting by him, in comes pretty Fatyma, with relief unto her Father, by all actions of love and duty, striving to shew her selfe obedient. Such time, (cursed time!) as this young Princess played about him, the Prince called her, who readily came to him to be made much of, but see, a horrid entertainment! for instead of the embraces of love, with admirable celerity, and rage, grasping her tender Neck with his strong and wrathfull hands, whirling her about, ere she could implore pitty, the inraged Son of a cruell Father, threw stark dead upon the floor his own daughter Fatyma, and in her the chief joy left to himself, and his distressed Princess (for the comfort of his revenge, how sweet soever in the Act, vanished with it) the excessive delight of the aged King, and sole ornament and comfort of all that Kingdom (that seemed to enjoy the greatest of their condition; for the Heir was with his Father buryed alive in a too early and unjust captivity.) His poor Princess, with all the strength of her weakness, seeing the Act, struggled with him, crying out to him, that it was Fatyma that he killed, little thinking he therefore killed her, because Fatyma. But he hearing his Son Soffie cry out too, in blind sort pursued him, who, led by his better fate, escaped down the stairs, and was safe. Fatyma dead, begat as much sorrow and rage in old Abbas, as alive she did love, who now sends threats of terrible satisfactions, as Famine, Chains, Strapadoes, and all sharp and exquisite tortures, to the inraged Prince his Son, who by his Messengers, returns his Father as many bitter curses, hopes of better, and more perfect revenge, and wishes of whole Cataracts of miseries to poure themselves upon him. In this Rage he spent two sad dayes, and in the third, with a Roman resolution, gave a period to his sufferings in this world, by quaffing off a cup of poyson, to the confusion of his unnatural Father. The sad Princess his Wife (like a true Turtle) surfeiting with sorrow, mew'd her self up, and since that time, has seldom been seen by any. Lastly, Allybeg's Treason being discovered by a woman, we end with the punishment of the Conspirators, the Kings reassuming of the Princes friends into his favour, and declaring of his Son Soffie Heir to the Persian Dignity, after his Grandfather Abbas his decease, which happening in the year 1629. the young Prince took upon him the Empire; aged sixteen years, hopeful and ingenious: so fresh in memory is this sad story.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Act. 1. EMIR-HAMZE-MIRZA'S Ghost. And dost thou swim in Pleasures, Tyrant, still? Or hast thou got a Patent to do ill? When will the date expire? hast thou not yet Contracted guilt enough, that th'ponderous weight Of all thy Tyrannies, Rapines, Murders fell, May, like a Milstone, sink thee quick to Hell? Are these too light? leave thy Adulteries, Thy Rapes, thy Incests, heaps of Perjuries, And Ghomorean sports, no sting behind? Or are the Gods grown all, like Fortune, blind? Or has dull IOVE no Thunder left? Doth not The murder of our Sire (so soon forgot) And Me, deserve a Bolt? Sleep'st thou? with what Philtries is thy strange Pillow stuft? do not Ten thousand Furies with their flaring hair, And knotted whips of wire, at thee still stare, And threaten stripes? Is our great Fathers Ghost Weary with haunting thee? or us'd to't, do'st Account it now familiar, and not quake? If so, behold, I come, from the dark Lake, To be thy evill Genius, and distill Into thy darker bosom deeds shall fill The measure of thy sins up, and pull down, With violent hand, heavens vengeance on thy Crown. The foul Fiend aid thy councells; and unto Discovers Abbas in his study. Thee dictate what he would, but cannot do. Upon thy self, and thine own Princely line, Revenge our Fathers wronged Ghost and mine. Inherit all my fury, and obey What jealousie shall prompt; mine did I say? Alas! (vain voice!) how weak is that for thee! The spirits of all unnaturall Fathers be Doubled upon thee. Act what the Mogull And Turk shall start to hear, what th'Tartar shal Pitty, what BAHAMAN could not wish should be, And the Arabian will lament to see. Faulter not in thy course now, but pursue New mischiefs, till no mischief can be new. “No cruell actions, unlesse throughly done “Are done secure. Let not thy gallant Son Engrosse the subjects loves: all his brave parts And deeds, are Privy seales to take up hearts. How will he stick (arm'd with the strength o'th Land) To snatch the Scepter from thy hated hand, As thou didst from thy Father? “Such dire deeds “Are still revenged with their like; no seeds “So fruitfull are, as wrongs. Who doth not thirst For Soveraign sway? or who, that may be first, Is pleas'd with being second? then do thou Begin with him, and wait not the first blow. But with a Sons, and Grandchilds blood, appease Fathers, and brothers Ghosts. What though thine ease Be bought with razing out the family, And strangling th'hopes of all Posterity? What need'st thou care (so here thy race be even) If when thou fall'st, the Poles and studds of Heaven Be shiver'd, the starrs quench'd, thy house, great names, And all the world too with thee sink in flames? “Free villanies a hated reign assure: “And swords still drawn: dire deeds, dire deeds secure. ABBAS. The vow is made, nor shall thy flattering Fate O MIRZA contradict it; though thy Troops Stood like a wall about thee, nay, though IOVE Presse all the Gods to guard thee, and should arme Them every one with Thunder, I would through: I'l tear the groundsells of thy Towers up; And make their nodding spires kisse the Centre, But I will reach thy heart, thy heart proud Victor. The power that I have climb'd to ere my time Cannot be safe, if any reach too near it. I feel my Crowns totter upon my head, Me thinks, and see him ready stand to latch them. Was I a Prince, born to the Persian greatnesse? Set equall with the Gods? and as ador'd As is the Sun our Brother? and shall I Be bearded by a Son, a beam of me? And like a Cypher add but to his value? I will, hereafter, call thee viper, ever. If thou canst lose thy filiall Duty, I Can lose my Bowells, and on thy ruines build A Pyramid to my revenge and safety. I that would wrest an Empire from a Father, And Brother, will not lose it to a Son. “Still may he fear that dares not to be cruell. ABBAS, FLORADELLA. Who's that? Flo. 'Tis I. Abb. My FLORADELLA. Flo. Yes. Abb. Enter my sweet: welcom as earliest light To th'infant world; and with thee ever bring A thousand Comforts to my thoughtfull breast. But why doth sadnesse invade Beauties Kingdom? And these faire eyes eclips their glorious splendour, He kisseth them. With vailes of melancholly? is't possible, So firmly inthron'd in thy ABBAS Love, That all the Gods should make thee know a grief? Flo. Alas! my Lord, the peoples common theam Still grates mine ears; no other voice is heard But MIRZA's praises: the Gods hear no vowes, No prayers, but for MIRZA's safety: who's So dull a soul that cannot, since he first Led out your armies count his victories, (As if all were Historiographers) And for each blow he dealt return a statue? Abb. I'le kick their sandy fabricks into dust, And rear a lasting one of their own heads, Higher then that in Spawhawn is to which Their Idolls own shall be the Cupola. Flo. They all read Lectures on his actions Till out of breath, they pause, and then admire. Till his encomiums hit the starrs and stick His Idolized name amongst them swearing The lustre of that one puts out the rest. You, my dear Lord, they say, lie wallowing here In pleasures, and will one day take a surfet. A good effeminate Prince, whose only act Of worth, is, that you gat so brave a son; Whom as the rising they adore for you, They think, have passed your Meridian, And now are nere your setting. Abb. Setting! yet I've heat enough to scorch them all to cinders. And see they not the Sun ne'r look so bloody As when he sets. Flo. Ah! but my noble Lord, How can I look upon this pompous Palace, Furnished with spoiles of nations; the long train Of early clients, that wear my Thresholds out: Nay, on your honored selfe, my excellent Lord, But as the Prisoner, late condemn'd to death, Doth on the pleasant meads, the curled groves, And silver brooks he passes by, as led To execution? These he alass, must leave. [She weeps.] And well I know how dead Kings Paramours Are dealt by, by their cruell successors. Abb. Why dead? why successour? but why these tears? Which I'le drie up with kisses, and revenge With as much blood of thy fea'rd enemies. Be a good huswife of these pearles, (my dear) Too pretious ere to spend, 'lesse when I die, Thou'lt shed a few of them t'enbalm me with. Who's that? It is the voice of Beltazar. Flo. Or Mahomet Allybeg, or both. Abb. Sit still. ABBAS, MAHOMET ALLYBEG, BELTAZAR, FLORADELLA. Come, come, my Lords, I've long expected you. Mah. We met i'th way a stop, a giddy stream Of people, with broad eyes, and right-up ears, Powring themselves from all parts to the Buzzarr. The novelty made us too mixe among them, What then made all this concourse, but to hear A Panegyrick, sung by hired Eunuchs, In adulation of the valiant Mirza? Abb. The mountain brought forth a ridiculous Mouse. Flo. Heaven grant it proves ridiculous. Abb. Heaven it selfe Can't make it otherwise. Bell. There were all the deeds Of your great ancestors, from Mortys Ally Recounted, not as copies to be followed, But made as soiles, to set off his the better; And brought but by comparison, to shew How his green valour conquers all example. So, said the flattering pamphlet, Peleus name Stoops to ACHILLES, and so SATURN joyes To be ore-topt by JOVE. Abb. O most felt flattery! Mah. And there exposed they his armed figure, In a triumphall Chariot, drawn by CYRUS And great DARIUS, yoak'd, with this inscription: As the new Moon the light o'th old devours; So do thy actions all thine Ancestours. Abb. No more, no more: seem'd any man of name To countenance this fairy Pagentry? Bel. No lesse then great Duke ELCHEE, at whose cost It was performed; he's hasting down to's charge, I'th army, this was his farewell to's friends. Abb. There's musick in that voice, would many more Of his rank durst oppose us. “There is gain “In mighty rebells. Flies and moths may buz About our beard and are not worth the notice, Or if we crush them they but foul our fingers. “'Tis noble prey deserves a Princes stroak: And by my Fathers soul, they shall not want it. Flo. Spoke like thy selfe! Mah. Heroick, god-like ABBAS. Bel. Let not my Soveraign doubt my proved faith, (That would ope MAHOMET's Shrine at your command) If humbly I play the Princes friend, And urge but their objections as thus, What ever glorious actions are atchiev'd By him or his, redound to the Kings glory, As all the souldiers to the generalls. What common souldier ever gained a Triumph? And yet, what Generalls single valour conquer'd? How then are you made lesse if he grows great Since all his greatnesse is not his but yours? Do not the flourishing of the branches adde To the Trees beauty?— Abb. But luxuriant boughs Not prun'd suck too much moisture from the Tree. Bel. What cares the Sea how great the Rivers swell, Since all their pride flow into her? Abb. But what The Sea doth get in one place, in some other It loses; and the more he wins upon Th'affections of the people, the more I lose. “Minions too great argue a King too weak. Mah. “Great Favourites should be set neare Kings as foiles “To set them off, not to vie lustre with them. “A Partner once admitted to a Throne, “Soon justles out the other: th'snakes new skin “Once come, she casts the old one. No where are “Two Kings in safety but in Teneriff, “And there the one is dead, but one alive. Bel. But 'tis not known the Prince intends a danger. Mah. It is not prov'd. Abb. 'Tis then too late, when prov'd, To be prevented. Flo. Cockatrices eggs Must not be brooded over till they're hatcht. Mah. “Kings fears are proof enough they that wil give “Them cause to fear, give cause enough, to strike. “A Treason is a kind of Hectique feaver, “In the beginning it is most easily cur'd, “But hardly known: But in the course of time, “Not having been in the beginning known, “To know it becomes easy, hard to cure. Bel. But he is modest— Flo. So are Whores at first, Coynesse is the best Lure. Bel. Blaming his friends For doubling of his merit, and chides himself For suffering of his acts so to be guilded, Lest they might any way eclipse your splendour. Abb. Hee's Politick: “Seen nets are easily 'voided, “And dangers threatned once, are half prevented. “The curst dog bites before he barks, and Thunder “Strikes ere it speaks. Treason still shuns the Sun. That female Vertue, Modesty, can't harbour In such a masculine spirit, even that He makes a bait to catch the vulgar with, It gets him a respect: He's not to learn “That honour, like a shadow, and love too “Shuns the pursuer, follows him that flies it. Mah. Why if he means no Rape upon the State, Doth he so fortifie himself in's Party, Binding all men of action unto him With all th'obligements of a Polititian? Abb. “He that will make a Faction means to use it. Mah. He studies every particular Genius, And taketh every one in his own height. Th'ambitious he makes his with honours, Titles, And high commands; saying, “worth loses lustre, “Like Gems in Quarries, if it be not set “To publique view, like Diamonds well mounted. The covetous he ties with chains of Gold To his own purposes, extolling “bounty “As th'most conspicuous vertue of a Prince, “And gainfullest; saying, Vertue else will freeze, “If it be not kept active with Reward, “Valours best Nurse. Those that are discontented “(And such are sure ones) he gains by favour, And silken promises. The multitude He stroaks with Popularity, and they Like true dogs fawn, and crouch as much to him. Though upon service he's austere enough, Exacting each mans duty; out of Action He courts the common souldiers by their names, Lies with them on the Guard, fares as they fare, And calls them all his fellows, sees them serv'd, In time of want, ere he himself will take The least refreshment.— Abb. What soules will not these Strong arts allure, if he meant war with IOVE, To storm even Heaven, and mak't a Colony! Flo. What, Heaven a Province! Mah. Noble Forts he builds, And Cittadells, as if he meant to compasse The Kingdom with a trench, and into these He put's his Confidents. Huge hoords of wheat, Munition Provision stuffe his Garrisons, When no Foe threats the Confines. If these charms Of Affability these knots of strength, And preparations signifie but care, And Arts of wisdom, which need 'wake no thought Of Jealousie, and require no prevention; Let's cast no Ramparts 'gainst the swelling Sea, But tamely think the peaceful NEPTUNE meanes Us no invasion but will sit content I'th'old Boundaries of his watry Empire. Cherish the speckled snake, and let him twine About your leg alas! poor loving worm! It onely comes to kisse your foot and means To dart no poisonous sting into your flesh. Bel. Has he no filiall love? no noble nature? Can't be that to him, to whom every Vertue Seems in this dearth of Pietie to run For Patronage, Paternall duty should Be, or a stranger, or a slighted Exile? Mah. He is ambitious, and “Ambition knowes “No Kindred, 'twas a maxim practised “By IOVE himself upon his Father SATURN. Abb. No, no, my Lords, that somthing must be done Is not the question but what? and how? Bel. Weaken him in his friends, call them from places Of trust, and put in others, or make them yours. Abb. No they are preingag'd, and will not come But to great baits: So to reclaim them would Cost much, to ruine them add more to us. ‘For all Rebellions, throughly suppress'd, “Make Kings more Kings, and Subjects still more Subject. Bel. Then call him from his strength, lure him to Court. And drown him here in pleasures and delights, 'Twill soften and enervate his great mind. “There's little fear of Carpet Kinghts, rough beards “And hairy men have still the working heads. Mah. And such is he. Abb. That were to crosse his Genius, And force his Nature backward, he is made For hardned steel, and not a masquing sute. No Musick please him but the bellowing Drum, No exercise but tossing of a Pike. So stout a nature never will recoil. Bel. Confine him to some Iland, with a set Of beardlesse Eunuchs, and soft Punks about him, Prohibiting all martiall company. Flo. Pictures and Beauties are alike to him; His soul's so full of's NYMPHADORA'S love, As throw him into 'an Ocean of Beauties, The vessel's full, and can take no more in. Bel. A brave truth from an Enemy! [aside] Abb. Confine him, That were to spur a fiery headstrong steed And have no reines to hold him: or to 'wake A sleeping Lion. “Persons of his rank “If once disgrac'd, must not be left a tongue “To tell it with, or hand to act Revenge, “No, nor a heart to think it. He that strikes “At mighty Enemies must do it throughly. Say my beloved MAHOMET, “must not Kings “That fear great subjects growth, and gathering strength; “Or wink at all, and conquer them with kindnesse, “Or, if they wil take notice, leave no need “Of second blowes, but at the first cut off “At once the fear they have, and cause of future? “Who finds a Serpent couch'd, and at one blow “Parts not his heart shall never fetch another. Mah. The Oracles are reviv'd, and speak in Abbas. But how much more then pitty is it, that So high a valour, Affabilitie (Vertues of brightest lustre with the Persian) And all the endowments of a Princely mind Should, like good seed in ground too fat, grow rank, And make him fit to feel the sickle! which Gladly I would disswade, were not the tree More worthy then a wanton branch, or th'head Then any corrupted limb, though ne'r so handsom. Abb. Ah my good Lords, the bowells of a Father Have yearn'd in me, and no small strift I had To gain a Conquest of my fond affection, And bend my will to part with him, as with A gangreen'd member to secure the whole. But I have won the field of foolish pitty, And sworn by the eight refulgent Orbs, his death. Flo. The young wolfes death can never come too soon; For he that spares the wolves, destroyes the sheep. Bel. But think, my honour'd Lord, will not the soul Of every subject bleed in his each wound? The pledge of their succeeding happinesse! The crown of their best hopes, hope of their Crowns And who will spare to damn for Tyranny (Pardon the speech, I act the Princes friend) A deed, so without Justice, proof, or conscience? Mah. Not all the steel forg'd into swords and spears, Nor all the Iron form'd to battering Rammes, Have ruin'd so many Kings, as that round word. “Conscience and Soveraign sway are things at odds, “'Tis mischifes freedom holds up Tyranny, “Which who so blushes t'own is no right King. Abb. No more debate; Sentence is justly pass'd, The execution rests which what if acted Vpon him i'th army? Mah. If the crueltie Chance to disclose it selfe on th'apprehension O'th murderer, t'may raise some dangerous tumult. “All cruell actions must be safely done, “And all their safetie lies in privacy. Abb. Let's train him up to court, and do it here. Mah. That thought needs not a second. Abb. Cause you then Our secretary t'indite letters to him Here to attend us with all possible speed, Where he shall be acquainted with the weight Of the affair that urges his quick comming. Provide a messenger of your own knowledge. Mah. I know my Province. Abb. You Lord BELTAZAR, Who are not so well known his enemie Though firme enough in our esteem, hast down Unto the Army, where, till he, you know Be on his journey hither, keep your mask on: Then break to the Lievtenant Generall Your power, and errand, which is to be set With him in joynt commission ore that Army, And be the noble partner of our care. Bel. My faith shall labour to deserve the trust. Abb. And thou my FLORADELLA shalt have work too. Be frequent in your visits to the Princesse, Extoll the vertues of her gallant Lord, And set the wheeles a going. “Praise gets confidence, That opennesse of speech, and women be “Best spies of womens actions. Sift her then, “What is intended, who, and where imployed. Speak with such confidence, as if you meant To force her think you know what never was. “Tis no lesse service to detect close treason, “Then to vanquish open and avoucht Rebellion. Flo. What arts will not my love unto my Lord Infuse into me, and what subtle care? Abb. You've all your parts, act them but like your selves, Ile in any study more o'th art of King-craft. Bel. Madam I kisse your hands. Yours Lord MAHOMET. MAHOMET ALLYBEG, FLORADELLA. This was well carried, there's another step To our great purpose whilst the Tyrant stood Firmly propt up by his heroick son And his brave Troopes, not all the Gods could shake him: Now that he ruines him he but lies down For me, and therefore thee, my FLORADELLA, Upon his neck to rise to soveraignty. Flo. But what if the successe should thwart the platforme, And something intervene to save the Prince? Would not the ruine turn upon our selves? ‘Such deeds are never safe till they be acted. Mah. Descend not from thy selfe so low as fear, The blow meant him is guided by a hand Sure and steady but if he misses aime, This very hand through wounds shall force his soul, So doth the love of thee arme me, Ile wrest The Scepter from JOVES hand but thou shalt have one. Flo. Why do you court your own Sir? Mah. Therefore deerest Because mine own and worthy a Gods courtship, I never meant thee lesse, nor have I woo'd thee To leave a Monarchs crowned love to grace A subjects bed, but to adorn these Temples With golden wreaths, more bright then ARIADNE's, And make thy name the subject of all Poetry. Then shalt thou trample on the under globe, And chuse what part of heaven thou meanst to grace. So great is the reward of MAHOMET's love. Flo. How growes your strength? what men of name, and fortunes Espouse your interest? Mah. 'Tis not yet my time To tempt too many: when the heir is gone, And all men in a maze, then is our houre. No Fish shall 'scape us, when the water's troubled. In the mean time get thee a party to thee Of the male-spirited Dames, that may engage Their sons and husbands, they are usefull evills, “Bosome solicitours are most prevalent. Flo. Ile find or make such: first I'me for the Princesse. MAHOMET ALLYBEG. Poor credulous Cockatrice! thinkst thou I'le rear My selfe a Throne, and set a strumpet with me? No, he that can crush Princes will not pick Thee out, among the rubbish of their ruines. Yet must ambition use such poor low things. Thou art a good close spie, a bosome traitour, And a fair bait for some smooth liquorish Sultan, Whom Ile perhaps buy with thy prostitution. But a companion of my Soveraignty Must boast a brighter vertue, higher descent, One that in making nature toil'd, and sweat: Such as the excellent Princesse NYMPHADORA, Whom when industrious nature once had form'd, She broke her mould, for never since could she Produce her like; she'l fit our proudest height; But her I'le not assay till I'me possessed Of my new royaltie: then—a Princes Throne Is a brave joynture, and the name of Queen, To a young Widow lusty in her blood, Will be a charme, hardly to be withstood. FARABAN. What curses are entaild on wicked pelfe! With a bag of mony in his hand. We, when we want it, scratch and plot to get it, And when we have it, fear to lose it still. I dreaded vildly those two craving souldiers That met me at my Merchants dore they were But meanly thatcht me thinks and seem'd to have Sharp stomachs too. They watcht and waited on me As dogs do upon children for their victualls. There lie ye—till my Tailors long long bill He locks it up in a Trunk. Brings an indictment strongly proved against you. Thus are we but the Gaolers of our wealth, Which although most men make their God, is but The Poets slave and mine—And but for use— Two THEEVES. [listning. Wee'l rescue your rich prisoner presently. [They knock. Far. Come in—(Pox on yee, its your tattar'd Rogueships.) 1 Theef. Your humble servant Sir. 2 Thief. Your servant Sir. Far. Gentlemen, you'l excuse me, I know you not. 1 Thief. You shall Sir know us better—Please you lend us The key of that same trunk—Stir and you die. One of them presents a dag to his breast. Far. Nay Gentlemen. 1 Thief. Nay, not a word y'had best.

Hang warmth and eating too, Wee'l drink, drink deep. 2. Thief. drink by the hower, and this same watch shall help us. To 'scape the Constables. Far. But I dare hold A rope of that—th'Devill!—rob'd!—and thus too Whilst they go to plunder his Trunk, he runs out, and gives the Alarum. Rob'd in a Complement!—Theves!—Theeves! ho Theeves! 1 The. Pox o'your care, could you not stop him? 2. The. Now (Prethee leave chiding to another time) We've no way but to follow him, and cry Out Theeves as loud as he: so we ith'hubbub They run after him May hap t'escape. 2 The. 'Tis best. Both. Theevs! Theeves! ho! Theeves! SOFFIE, FATYMA, IFFIDA Is this the story's to be acted? Looking upon a Picture. Iff. Yes Sir. Sof. I love to see these Actions, they will put Spirit into me. Is the Princesse ready? Iff. She will be presently. You stand on thorns now. Fat. Shall I see't too? Iff. Yes, yes, my pretty Lady, If you'l sit patient there, and weep no more. Fat. Indeed I will not: but I could not hold Last day, they were so cruell; could you IFFIDA? To see hard-hearted PROGNE stab her Son! And all the while the boy cling to her breast, And for each wound she gave return a kisse! Sof. Go, y'are fainthearted. If. Nay Sir, she's good natur'd. Fat. This too is some sad story: tell me IFFIDA, Why do's this woman look so angry here? Sof. What ailes that old man so to weep? I can't Indure to see a man weep it showes cowardly. Iff. That fierce Lady MEDEA resolv'd to fly With her new servant JASON from her Father; To hinder his pursuit she tore in pieces Her brother ABSYRTUS, and bestrewd ith'way His limbs which that old man, their father finding, He stopt his vaine pursuit of's cruell Daughter, To gather up by peace meal his torn son, And seems to bath each piece with teares, as if He thought them Cement strong enough to set The tatter'd joynts and flesh again together. Fat. Was she a sister? O I could not do So by you SOFFIE for all the world— I care not now for seeing it presented, I hate all cruelty so perfectly: Yet could I bear a part with that old man, And weep as fast as he; so infectious Is a just sorrow, chiefly in old persons. NYMPHADORA, SOFFIE, FATYMA, IFFIDA, PAGE. What ailes my FATYMA to drown her blossomes Of beauty thus in tears? Child art not well? Fat. Yes Madam, but this piece is limnd so lively, As it doth strain tears from me to embalm Poor torn ABSYRTUS with. Nym. Pretty compassion! I like this tendernesse in thee: but we think This a feign'd story. O may reall griefs Ne'r touch thy breast, poor thing!—wilt see it acted? Fat. It will, I fear, make me too melancholy. Nym. Do as thou wilt, my Heart. Fat. This piece shall be My melancholly study, and sad Tutor. When I have either cause or will to weep, Ile take up this, and sit, and think. I see The tender boy stretcht out his hands unto me For help, and sigh, because I cannot rescue'him. Then think again, the old man calls out to me To help him gather up his sons limbs; and weep Because I cannot. Iff. Pretty innocence! Sof. Pray Madam, let me wait upon your Highnesse To th'Tragedy. Nym. Thou shalt sweet-heart. Iff. What now? Pag. If't please your grace, the Lady FLORA DELLA Is lighted at the gate, and means a visite. Nym. She's welcome. Sof. Pish, pish, now her idle chat Will keep us beyond time. Nym. Soft my young Gallant. NYMPHADORA, FLORADELLA, SOFFIE, FATYMA, IFFIDA. Hail my good Lady. Flo. Mighty Princesse, hail. Nym. Please you to sit. Flo. How does my little Lady? Fat. I thank you Madam. Flo. And you my Lord? Sof. Madam, At your service. Flo. Troth, an early courtier. How happy are you, Madam, in these copies Of your fair selfe, and your renowned Lord? By which you've fild times sharp teeth, and secur'd Your names, your formes, and natures, from the wast Of death, and eating age; nor is it fit So eminent a beauty, and cleer vertue Should for lesse then eternity grace the world. Nym. Why, Madam, give you me the trouble to Speak your words over? for these heights of courtship Are but like sounds made in a hallow room, In expectation of the Eccho's answer. FLo. No, Madam, by your beauty and that is The greatest Power that I can swear by, I Oft lose my self in pleasing Contemplation Of you as Natures, and as Fortunes darling. By whose best gifts yet can you never be So highly grac'd, as you do grace their gifts, And them too by your bare receiving them. What had the Gods in all their Treasury Of greater worth or lustre then the Prince, Your excellent Lord? A Prince that striketh dumb Envy and slander! and gives Fortune eyes! And who could they find worthy to bestow This great result of all their sweat upon But you? who yet deserve him every inch. Nym. In him indeed I am compleatly happy. But he is so far above all deserving, As I can plead no merit; yet the Gods Themselves have sometimes deign'd a mortall love. Flo. In which of all the Gods fortunate Princesse, Could you have been so happy as in him? With better grace thou Phœbus dost not hold Thy gorgeous rein, nor from thy glistring Throne Scatter more beauty or more Majesty! A Majesty indeed too great to know Any Superior. And now that the King Is bow'd down with the burden of old age, The heavy weight of the unweildy Empire Grow but a trouble to his aged shoulders. His Crownes are to his head a load, no more An ornament It's fitter his white Age Should now indulge his genius, and release His thoughts from all the ruffle of the world, And give him time to contemplate the place He tends to every day. So should the Prince Make his few daies brighter and easier to him, By taking on himself (now fit for labour) That load of care we call the Soveraignty. Nym. Pray Madam give such thoughts no longer breath, Thoughts that the loyall Prince and I detest. 'Tis the base viper gets a life by forcing A violent passage through his Parents bowells; My Country Phœnix when he duly mounts His Fathers spicie Throne, brings on his wings His honour'd ashes, and his funerall odours, To shew, he climb'd not, till his death, his seat: Flo. Your Highnesse rather should assist his rising, By gaining more to's party, which is done With but a gracious look or smile from you. ‘So prevalent an Oratour is beauty. Nym. No, by his life, and all the love I bear him, I'd rather follow him fairly to his Tombe, Perfum'd with that unblemish'd stock of honour He now stands in, then that so fouly broke, See him untimely thrust into the Throne. And justifie my self a loyaller wife, In loving more his honour then his life. Flo. (Unconquerable Vertue if the Gods [in secret. Give me a Plague 'twill be for th'injury I do this noble pattern of all goodnesse) Well Madam, you may feed upon that air, But there are those wish the design on foot. And promise to themselves a fair successe. So great's the love they have for the brave Prince, An expectation of a braver King. 'For 'tis Authority declares the man. Nym. I'l thrive their trai'trous plots. Iff. My Lord, speak to her. Nym. But in his face I read my SOFFIE think's This conference might be spar'd, as well as I, For he was wooing me to carry him To see MEDEA play'd, at Madam OMAY'S, And I am loth to disappoint his hopes. Flo. I'le be no cause of that.—I'le wait you thither. Nym. You'l honour me. Flo. (I'le go before you one day.) [secret.] MAHOMET ALLYBEG, SELEUCUS. I need not tell thee, my SELEUCUS, what Hast, secrecy, and care must wait your journey. Attend Duke ELCHEE first, but privately, And with my letters give him high salutes, To work in him a confidence of me. When you have obtain'd Audience of the Prince, Note with what gust he takes his call to court, And ere he be upon the way, be sure I have a Post, t'inform me of the minute I may expect him here; that his arrivall Anticipates not my provision for it. Sel. My Lord, no part of your instructions shall Be unobserv'd, and what my care can more, Rely upon. Mah. Be happy.—This will prove His faith, and diligence, and those shall be The rules by which i'l further trust or slight him. All tooles are not for greatest works, they must Be try'd, and 'bide the tryall must be made Staves in the ladder we ascend a Throne by. MAHOMET-ALLY-BEG, BELTAZAR. Hail my Lord BELTAZAR, what, you are going To take possession of your new command? I wish your journey and that too prosperous. You know you have a friend in Court, and I Assure my self of one now in the Army. Bel. That your assurance will never fail you. The King expecteth your Attendance. Mah. I Am with his grace already;—Adieu my Lord. BELTAZAR. How quick's this Jack of state! if this my journey, And th'whole project be not a web of his, I misse my mark.—The Prince is grown too great And must be fear'd, and presently remov'd, Not 'cause he is too great for ABBAS, but For ALLY-BEG: But this I must not see, Because I cannot help. Should I suggest it Unto the Prince, 'twere but to fall with him. I'le rather save my self, and try if I Can keep an even Path, 'twixt the two hills. “'Tis better give way to, then resist ills, “And raging Lions, of too horrid might “To be withstood by force of Law, or right. “The Prince must fall: his ruines will be great Enough many lesse Princes to create; Why may not I be one of those? so from A River stop't, many small runs do stream. Vertue, I love thee, but with thee to stand Were now to fall; ‘Yet what the King commands “That word makes Vertue, or at least Law; for he “Can do no wrong, since 'gainst himself't must be, “And to the willing nothing's injury. How ere, 'tis wisdom to obey:“They who “Will rise at Court, must not dispute, but do. CHORUS. O misery of greatest states! Obnoxious to unconstant Fates! ‘Great and good Persons well may be “From guilt, but not from envy free. “They that stand high in Publique trust “Expect the forked arrowes must “Of such below, as deem their parts “Lesse in employment then deserts. These vapours yet may hap ore fly So long as the helm is guided by Temperate Spirits, and severe Judges, that both know, and dare. And whilst that Kings will, in things high, Their action to good counsell tie. And not by single advise be led, Oth'passionate unsalted head. “But since that flattery and ease “Crept into Princes Palaces, “'Tis dangerous to be good, or great, “For such the Court's a slippery seat. “Nor is it safe for Subjects since “Too too much t'oblige their Prince, “With mighty service, that exceed “The Power of his noblest meed; “For whom he cannot well reward, “He'l find occasion to discar'd: To which many a Parasite His easie nature wil excite, Things sold to riot, that still swell With envy 'gainst such as do well, Because their glory blazing higher Then theirs, ecclipses their false fire: So much he for their private ends Divest himself of his best friends Nor so their humour's fed, care they If he and his become a prey To's greatest foe, 'gainst whom their care Defend him neither can nor dare. “These are those ear-wiggs to a King ‘Then hostile foes more ruine bring. As Ivy seems the blooming spray T'adorn but sucks his heart away: So do they rob their Prince of's heart, In making him his duty 'invert And the best Government Monarchy, Degenerate into Tyranny; Perswading him, his single will His Realms are made but to fulfill. They make a wolfe thus of whom Heaven To th'flock hath for a shepheard given. The Sun they might as truly, say Is vested with his flaming Ray, To scorch and not assist the Earth With gentle warmth, to naturall birth. “The Flatterer merits worse of you “O Kings then whose pale Poisons brue. “They kill but single Princes, he “Assassinates even Monarchie. Leave then with beasts your sportive war, Or hunt no beast but th'Flatterer.</field>

And when thou pour'st out with full sea thy spite, Swim with more strength against the angry tide. Conspire with the Foe that not to you The honour may but to my self be due.

I study nothing here, so much as how to merit your high favour, and do something may fix me strong in your desired friendship.— [Elc.] Why this to me, that never yet could gain More then a quarter face,—thus—or perhaps An over shoulder look from this great MAHOMET? This sole ingrosser of the royall aspect? To me this! a disgrac'd cast Courtier! Sure this is more then complement, yet not scorn? It lookes like serious. He has his ends if he But speaks, or bowes, or nods to any man. His very looks and smiles are all design. Had I best meet his courtesie half way? Or shun it as a snare? Sure he thinks not Me cheap enough to be his instrument In a low matter? and in great his craft Has not enough of confidence in me. I'le not embarque too far, yet still egg on His confidence to make my breast his closet. Then either close in what may serve my self, Or save my Head by 'vnraveling his Plots. He hath somwhat ith'forge and hopes my late Disgrace and discontent will make me blow The cole with him, though he'd but use my foot But as the Cats to reach the nut out of The fire for his tooth. He's not to learn “That male-contents are tinder for a faction. He may remember too, that “with great Persons “New benefits blot not out old injuries. He hopes I'le catch the spark, if not for love To him, for hate to th'Tyrant, who yet perhaps Bids him cast out his lures to tempt my stomach. Yet will I see the bait, and play with it, And since I see it, fear not to be hit.— Who waits there?— Pag. My Lord? Elc. Desire the Gentleman To enter,—Favours done to followers Oblige their Lords; as he that did relieve MINERVA'S weary Priests ingag'd the Goddess. ELCHEE, SELEUCUS. Come sir this masse of love your honour'd Lord Is pleas'd to send me, flowes with such a tide Of joy upon me, as I shall either die This night, or else live forty years the longer. Sel. My Lord, his honour's covetous to find Fit objects for his love, he's us'd to say, But now he needs not seek abroad, your Grace Deserves it all, and he is no lesse just To pay desert her due, then wise to find it. Elc. Y'are too obliging, we know his judgement well Which yet in nothing's more conspicuous, Then in such prudent choice of followers. Sel. My Lord, when will the Prince— Elc. The Prince anon Will be at th'Councell of war; there or expect My entrance, or else by some attendant, Give me but notice of your being there, And I'le present you to his Grace, according To your good Lords desire. The time draws on. I'th interim, here's some will entertain you. MOZENDRA, SELEUCUS, BENEFIAN. Seleucus! hail. Sel. Well met dear Colonel. Ben. Welcome my better half, welcome to th'Camp. Moz. How looks the Court? Sel. As't uses, like a Lottery, Where one may draw and draw till he exchanges His whole stock but for blanks: and if by chance A Prize do come, 'tis more by luck then skill: And then the noise, the Drum, and generall cry Follow the fortunate, when a thousand others That ventur'd more, may sit and curse their starrs. Moz. A good Satyrick Metaphor; in them both Blind fortune rules. Ben. But how are Ladies? reasonable? Sel. Even as they ever were, and ever will be. Shaddowes, shaddows of us: pursue them and You may pursue, and tire in the chace, Seem but to fly, they'l follow, and be handled. Moz. 'Twas ever so, keep them but sharp and they'l Obay the lure. Ben. Watch them and they'l be tame. Sel. But with fresh oaths songs, kisses, Duells, (food Strong and approv'd) gorge them, and they'l turne taile. Ben. A pretty truth: but who bears greatest price. Sel. Why, faith, the plainest, th'fairest ever are Most kind and least proud— Ben. So, And what new loves? How thrives the new sect of Platoniques? ha? Sel. Troth the best Pimp that ever enter'd Court. Moz. You need not fear the grouth of such a weed, Nor hope we better fruit, since that the Persians Begun to follow th'Lacædemonians. Ben. Then i'le up and turn Courtier, SELEUCUS Wilt buy my Regiment? Mox. Prethee BENEFIAN Wilt now turn fly, and spend the day in buzzing In Ladies beams till thou hast sing'd thy wings? Fie, fie, the Prince here shewes thee 'nobler game, Wilt thou, like an ill-handled kite upon Her wings after a noble quarry, go Away with paultry check? or leave a Partridge To dop after a lark, or Robinred-brest? Ben. There is a Syren in that tongue.—well, i'le Consider a while of't. But you SELEUCUS Mean to stay with us, ha? and see some sport? Moz. Yes, yes you will not leave the stag at Bay. Sel. Well, i've a Mistrisse I would fain present With a piece of a torn Banner. Ben. Well said my Bully HECTOR,—but hold—The Lords o'th Counsell EMANGOLY, METHICULI, HYDASPUS, ALKAHEM, MATZED And now my Lords, what businesse calls loudest To be the first discussed in our Counsell? Met. Exchange of Prisoners; many we hold of ther's At needlesse charge, as many they of ours Deserving men and stout, whom we much want. Hyd. Our Regiments and companies are thin, Scarce one in ten of them amounts to half The constitution: So the Guards are weaker Then else they should: and thus hard duty comes Oftner to the same men, till the poor souldiers Grumble, and faint beneath the load, and scarce Are held from mutiny; But which is worse, A masse of Treasure daily is consum'd On idle officers, Parchment Colonells And titular Captains, that ne're saw four files Vnder their Ensigns, or perhaps no more Then their own groomes, or private servants, save Some that they borrow'd upon daies of muster, Or else pretended to lie sick in Quarters. Ema. Dead payes are not to be eschewed: tis grown An abuse too strong for reformation. The rest, the Prince has thoughts how to redresse, And means it suddenly, by casheering and Reforming idle officers, and filling all His Regiments; which method he intends To be exact to four times ith'year. Mat. All gentlemen that come as volunteers Expect commands, which yet they measure by The greatnesse of their states, not martiall skill. A Troop, a Company, or a Regiment Each novice claimes as due; lesse cannot answer A full fortune: when, for a Princes selfe, They that know any thing, know tis no disgrace To traile a Pike under a known Commander. Hyd. But tis disgrace enough, and something more, I'd almost said tis treason, t'undertake More then a mans abilitie can perform, Since the King suffers in it more then he; The King, more in his work, then he in's credit. Alk. These in their times; but first, if you concur, Some thoughts of the reducing of yon City Were seasonable: the seige is long and tedious, And sicknesse and disease invade our camp, As if the foe had made them of their party. And that, my Lord METHICULI, makes good Your proposition; that place won, we gain Those prisoners, whose exchange will cost us dear. Mat. My Lord, I eccho you. What a disgrace Would stick upon our names indeleble As cowardise, if our great Princes standard, That never yet was fixt in vain before A hostile Fort, but useth to display Its selfe still on the Enemies proudest Turret, Should now be left alone, or which is worse, Forc'd to remove? Ema. Though all the Gods were parties, Our Princes stars are of a cleerer light, Then so to be eclips'd by th'Turkish Moon. Hyd. She's pale, and waines already, and his Arme Shall pluck her from her sphear, or quench her in it. Met. Or daube her hornes with Ottoman blood, till she Sets red, or shrinks into her Cloud, and wasts. Alk. How can it be but so, when such a Sun As this appears, drowning her sickly light! MIRZA, EMANGOLY, ELCHEE, METHICULI, HYDASPUS, ALKAHEM, MATZED, MOZENDRA, BENEFIAN. My Lords, this City stands stiffe in our way, But none I hope, have any other thoughts Then tempting of our stars, till the proud Turrets Bow to our feet, and sink in vengefull flames; For why should she ere boast a brighter fate, Then her as potent sisters, that now kisse Our yoak, and humbly truckle under us? Ema. And so shall she, and glory in the bondage; For to be slave to you, is next to win. This my Lord ALKAHEM wisely advis'd, Should be our first addresse unto your Highnesse. Mir. He spoke my thoughts, or rather I in him. Alk. This I the rather was induc'd to do, Because, since the two Mines we sprung last day, And five former assaults, prov'd unsuccessfull And all your Messages met a Rejection: I humbly now conceive, no storm or scale So fit to be attempted, as some stratagem To be advis'd of. Mir. Give us but a hint. Alk. An't please your Royall Highness, the last sally 'Twas my fortune to make two young men Prisoners, Whom by their civill fashion and demeanour, I judg'd and found to be men of the Book, Rather engag'd by novelty to see Something of war, then any way expert In these rough meetings: these I had into My Tent, where being well warm'd with Shiras wine, They fell into a freedom of discourse, And, among other things, assured me, They in the City had receiv'd a Promise From OSMANHELI, their old Governour, Of succours within four dayes, for which service He was prepar'd, and stay'd but for some Gallies, And Frigots to convoy him, and inable him To passe through our Fleet, which Navy he had A good assurance would attend him shortly. And these are th'onely hopes hold up their hearts, And keep their Gates shut 'gainst your Royal Highness. Neither is this discovery the effect But of their drink, for, sober, they confirm it. Elc. The same, a Page of mine, lately their Prisoner, Who mad's escape in the same sally, told me, He learnt ith'Town. Mat. It is the generall voice Among the meaner Prisoners, who hug their Condition, and joy they are with us, That they may eat again, famine within Rages so strongly. Moz. Hopes of this supply, They say, do onely keep the Town from uproar. Ben. The starved Souldiers fly upon their Leaders, And cry with a half hollow voice, Bread! Bread! For heavens sake Bread: when shall we eat again? They answer, do but smell upon your Matches Four dayes longer, then by th'life of MORAT, If no help comes, we'l make our best conditions. Met. It seems 'tis a conceit strongly believ'd, That they shall have reliefe. Alk. Believ'd, my Lord, They every hour trace the sands, the walls They climb, and Turrets, peep through Prospectives, And if they but descry a Sea-gull, 'tis A Sail, and if a flock, O that's the Navy, Till lost again they chide their credulous faith, And curse the two crosse winds, till their own sighs But make them stronger to defeat their joyes. Hyd. I had the guard last night, and intercepted A messenger in disguise from the said OSMAN, With Letters sown in's Tulipant, spoke the same. These be the Letters—, and the Postscript fixes The time two dayes, or three at farthest. Mir. Good, And you conceive now, we may send a Party Fresh flourishing in the Enemies Colours, who By this pretence, may gain perhaps admittance, And so surprize the Town? Ema. 'Tis probable. Alk. 'Tis certain. Mat. Nay 'tis more, 'tis done already. Mir. Well, since you've such a confidence, we'l try it. The Prince lightly peruses the Letters, then gives them to the Lords, who hand them from one to another. You, my good Lord, METHICULI, shall command In this design, to whom we'l joyne your Regiment, HYDASPUS, and yours, ALKAHEM, and yours MATZED. Met. Our care shall not be wanting. Mir. Have the Brigads Ready t'imbarque by the first light o'th'morning: In the mean time, we'l send unto our Admirall, That riding in the gulph, blocks up the Town, To bring ships down unto the Haven this night, For to transport you in, those must you wing With Turkish Flags and Streamers, and acquaint him With the adventure, that you passe the Fleet In the next night, yet not without some skirmish, To work the greater confidence ith'City, That you are foes to us, and their recruits. Yet least discovery frustrates the project, Keep your selves whole, that you may so make good Your quick retreat. You, my Lord ELCHEE, At the same time shall storm on the Land side, To give the greater terrour and diversion To the Towns strength: so fortune aid the attempt. My selfe, and you, EMANGOLY, will be ready Either to enter with the Horse, or succour Our friends, if they be forc'd to a retreat. Alk. If this succeeds 'tis but our keeping up The Turkish Colours on the Towers awhile, And we shall so traine in the succours sent For th'Towns reliefe, who ignorant of its taking, Once landed, can't scape us. Mir. Grasp not too much. Ema. The Action promises well. To Elchee in secret. Ben. My Lord, SELEUCUS Attends without. Elc. Sir, you'l oblige me, if You'l please to bring him in, and i'l present him. Mir. MOZENDRA, let it be your care to make Our Admirall know our project, and desire Of Ships from him. Moz. Sir, I am gone about it. SELEUCUS. [To them. All hail. Elc. May't please your Grace, this Gentleman Is come from Court, with Letters for your Highnesse, From your dread Father. Mir. He is welcome,—Sir, How fares our Royall Father? Sel. By me he sends Your Highnesse twenty thousand blessings: and Is kept in health, if but by the relation Of your renown, which gives him hourly musick, So gratefull to his Majesty is your fame. Mir. We'l study to requite his love with duty. Mat. My Lord HYDASPUS, and you ALKAHEM He delivers his Letters to the Prince, kisses his hand, and retires. The Prince opens, &amp; reads them to himselfe. And you MATZED, will all be sure to bring Down to the Haven, before the Moon arises, Your Regiments, where you shall find me ready To lead you aboard, the Ships I need not doubt, They being my MOZENDRA'S care. Hyd. Do'nt doubt me. Alk. Nor me. Mat. Nor me. [He starts. Mir. Sure I red not right! Hyd. His message likes him not. Mir. O for an Augur! Ema. Good heaven! what an Oglio of thoughts His Highnesse has in's face! Mat. He reads disturbance In very line. Ben. What bold blind fate dares thwart him! Mir. 'Tis so—Well, Souldiers may'nt dispute their orders.— My Lord, I've here commands come from my Father, Forthwith to wait upon him, and I dare Think nothing but obedience.—But O in What a Dilemma between duty and honour Stand I? Honour calls to me from the house Of Fame, built all of sounding Brass: and what Wilt thou, sayes she, that hast given up thy name To me, go wanton in the Courts soft pleasures? When yet the field is cover'd with thy Army, And new attempts resolv'd? Alk. Heare, heare her sir. Mir. Then filial duty calls loud from the Temple, T'obey is your chiefe honour, the contrary Would fix more staines upon your Name, then all The Ottoman blood, could you set it a Tilt, Could ever wash away. O strait! who sayes not, To go is Cowardize, to stay, Rebellion? Ema. Excuse me sir, were it not blasphemy 'Gainst our great MITHRA, to say the Sun wants light, When he doth but keep state in gloomy dayes? No, no your Highness have possess'd the world Enough with your known valour, now no spot Will stick to you; besides who knows your business? Your Highness going may be necessary, And so your journey give more honour to you, Then kicking ope this Towns Gates with your foot. Met. O'th'other side, some handsome excuse may Give satisfaction to the King, till this Design be over, and not incur displeasure. Ema. It may so, yet, why should our Lord the Prince Run that hazard? his stay may do him hurt, In losing th'opportunity of some Action, Sure of concernment, else the King would not Have sent, knowing the weight of his work here: Or worse, it may provoke his Fathers anger, At least suspition: His going cannot harm him, This Plot is so contriv'd as we may act it: Nor need the common Souldier know he's gone; Put one into his Armour to disguize it. When he is there, if the affair be urgent, 'Tis well he went: if not, he may return To us before the Action. Mir. I'm confirm'd, Obedience possesses me all over. Ile up, and down again, quick as your thought: If I be forc't to stay, go on and prosper: But duty bears me not faster to him, Then Love and honour shall again to you: And so adieu my Lords. Ema. Heaven keep your Highness. Elc. Go safe. Met. And safe return. Hyd. And well as safe. BELTAZAR, EMANGOLY, ELCHEE, METHICULI, HYDASPUS, ALKAHEM, MATZED, BENEFIAN. Hail my Lord Duke of Shiras. Ema. My Lord BELTAZAR! What wind wast drave hither trow? [In secret. Elc. No good one, You may be confident. Bel. Save you my Lords. Ema. O my apprehensive soul! I'd give [Aside. An eye my Lord the Prince were here again. Bel. 'Tis thus, in short, my Lords, His Majestie Dreading some sickness growing strong upon him— Hyd. He was in health even now. [Aside. Alk. Stay sir, observe. Bel. Thought good to send down for his Sonne the Prince The staffe of his old age, to be about him: And has done me the honour to command me Hither, to stand in joynt Commission over Th'Army, with you, My Lord EMANGOLY, My honour'd Colleague. Ema. Your standing is my fall. [Aside. Bel. My Lords, methinks I see, and grieve to see, Something like Discontent in all your faces. Ema. I'm justly proud sir, to be joyned with So eminent a Vertue; but this, in this Conjuncture of time, I think, was ill advis'd. Now, when the Army is neer worried out In a long war, to tear their darling from them, Will rellish ill. Ben. I'l up, and turn Platonick. Met. And I Stoick. Mat. Ile to my Farm, and there [They whisper Sow Mustard-seed: the Prince gone farewell Arms. Elc. This is a trick, the Prince nere dreamt of it. Alk. A bait, to lure him up and lodge him—O. Ema. My Lord, his Highness ere we lost him, laid The Plat-form of a Plot to gain this City By a surprize; till that be done, wil't please you To keep close your Commission, lest th'novelty Disturbs the Action. Bel. Sir, I'l be advis'd In this, and all things, by your better judgement. Met. We all do know our duties, let's attend them. Ema. Go then, my Lords, I'l follow:—or I thinke, We had as good let this adventure fall, 'Twas but to please the Prince. Bel. Sir, as you please: I've some dispatches, those over, I am yours. EMANGOLY, ELCHEE, METHICULI, HYDASPUS, ALKAHEM, MATZED. BENEFIAN. The Prince call'd up to stay! and one sent down To take his place? and that a Courtier too! Plot of some Turk to ruine Persia By striking her good Genius! Impudent head! Worthy a thousand thunderbolts, that durst Once mention it! why stay we in the Army? There's not a Captains place now to be given But some Court-Madam must dispose it, to Perhaps some little leg'd Gentleman-Usher. Ben. Or decay'd Stallion. Elc. Though we toil'd and sweat To purchase honour for the Prince, we will not That BELTAZAR shall share with us. Ema. Shall I Be coupled now, after so many Triumphs, With a Court Spaniell? I'le let the Turk in first, Say my good Lords what, can you shrug and fawn, And complement? your Generall is a Courtier. Now you must fight in method, exercise Your men as in a Dance.— Met. Pox, let all fall. Hyd. Best call MOZENDRA back, and lets do nothing. Mat. But mutiny. Elk. Or at best, raise the Siege. Ema. The shame wil not be ours, but the dul Kings, That knowes not how to prize a worthy Son. Omnes. With all our hearts. Met. Let's hold together then, And we are safe. Ema. You are an Oracle. The King shall know that nothing shall be done, Lesse we be pleas'd, and have again, his Son. BELTAZAR, SELEUCUS. SELEUCUS, is thy Post upon his wings T'inform thy master of the Princes coming? Sel. My Lord, I have dispatch'd him. Bel. Prethee stay him For my Packet. Sel. My Lord, i'l after him. Bel. Do so,—and then the King shall know he must not Pull down his Son and let these great ones stand, That are but his dependents, pieces of him. They're grown too great to obey any but Their Prince, and will not brook my rising ore them. And yet, to speak my conscience, they're but honest, And do, but what I should; yet now that is not The way to thrive, and so may well be lov'd And wished, but not practis'd, without losse. “As he that fells an Elm, must also fell “The Ivy Vine, and under shrubbs that dwell “Beneath his shade, and cling in loving sort “About his bole some but for their support, “Some to suck sap from him: So who'd remove “A Prince, or great man, strong ith'Peoples love, “Must strike his followers too. A mighty man “Doth never fall alone, no more then can “The beams and columns of a Palace and “The Rafters and the sparrs unmoved stand. CHORUS. What dire effects evill Counsell workes Even to unhinging greatest states! It doth allure with specious baits, But underneath foul Poison lurkes. The Prince, to please a factious few Must rob himself even of his best Of friends, and discontent the rest, Which he may ever after rue. This happens when the Princes ear Is open (drown'd in soft delight) Unto the bosom Favorite, Or undermining Flatterer. How hard and difficult a thing, Almost above the power of man, Or even what the immortalls can, Is it, to be a prudent King! Almost with honour due to IOVE, Such 'tis no Piacle to adore, For sure, hourly lesse, or more, He hath intelligence from above. O what a narrow path doth lie For him! what a straight neck of land? 'Twixt this dire Rock, and that Quicksand, Here base contempt there flattery! To escape flattery men must know He loves the naked truth to hear; But if these freedomes given are To all, they to contempt will grow. So dost thou loose thy reverence Great TITAN, guider of the Day, Because thou dost with equall Ray Thy light alike to all dispence. The wise Prince then some few selects, And but to them gives libertie To tell him all things as they be, From th'rest he nought hears or expects. Of such a prudent choice must be. (Men wise and daring, that above His Fortune do his Person love) Lest they fall into flattery. Not chose for favour, but for parts, Not so poor as they him must make Their prey, nor should he any take For their high Fortunes, but deserts. Nor must he yet let them ingrosse His love; keep them his Counsellors Not Favourites, lest the gaining theirs Of all hearts else becomes the losse. Should SOL from one place ne'r remove And starve the rest, scorch would that part With curses, and his partiall Cart Might more esteem get, but lesse love. “Few Favourites were there ever seen “But either wrought their Kings decay, “And prov'd Usurpers, or else they “Have by the People ruin'd been. “O Kings, be sparing to make those “Whom well you love, your Favourites; “For them you give to vulgar spights, “Or else, for them, your selves, depose.</field>

BELTAZAR'S Power known once, all flew off The hinges; every face, grew dull and misty; All late resolves of Action recoil'd As if their bloods were cooled, and frighted back, Either through fear, their Treason is smelt out, And so they shall not stay long after him, Or else for pure Love to him they mourn'd; But 'twas not love, men of the blade and Action, Us'd to quaffe blood for Healths, are too too rough For that soft tender Vertue to inhabit. Abb. 'Twas conscious guilt that flew into their faces, Arm'd with her furies whipps and Harpy nailes. Mah. Was it not time then to disarm the Serpent Of's sting? who now may hisse, but never bite. Abb. BELTAZAR writes EMANGOLY and ELCHEE Seem most displeas'd, and slight his joyning with them. Mah. They know themselves, and know withall that hee Or I, or any, whom your grace dares trust, Have not the Art of war. They know you need them, Therefore take boldnesse thus to nose and beard you. Abb. I'le ruine all mankind first. No, this war Is but t'inlarge our Territories; honour, Not need or Right is all the cause: I'le send Commissioners down, and clap up peace with th'Turk, And so disband this factious Army. Then Let th'haughty Duke of Shiras have a care Lest I absolve my self of my rash oath, Never to lop him shorter by the head. By th'hands at least I will, that is the Power. “The misery of rach oaths! yet in the cause “Of Treason, no man hath a priviledge. I'le thrust him from his Government of Shiras, I'le turn his feast of Lillies into Cypresse. And remove ELCHEE from Hyrcania too. Mah. To out EMANGOLY you've pretence enough. Ha hath been long continued in his trust; Places so high ar'nt onely for one Subject Your Majestie have many to reward, And honour is the cheapest way you have. But ELCHEE has had no time in's Honour, And been provok'd already; besides he May still be usefull, and hee's yet too great For such disgrace. “'Tis never safe to anger “Too many great ones at one time, Sir, ELCHEE Made yours once, will serve to ballance th'other. Yet for a while, banish him from your presence, 'Twill make him conscious of his fault, and put him Upon some thoughts how to regain your favour. Then, to be reconciled is to win him. “'Tis better to gain one friend, then crush then foes. But let EMANGOLY be clean cast off, As uselesse quite, and not to be reclaim'd. Abb. Wise MAHOMET, thou shalt rule me, bee it thy care To draw up Articles, find Commissioners To fetch us peace, impowr'd with full instructions. Mah. Who mean you in EMANGOLY'S roome, ore Shivas? Abb. Who but thy self, companion of my Reign? Who else is fit to be second in glory, Or help to bear so many pondrous Crowns? I now shall take sound sleeps and no more start, Or break my troubled slumbers, with conceit Of sword, or Treason. The Hesperian fruit Was not so safe under the Dragons guard, Nor the golden Fleece kept by the brasse-hoof'd Bull Half so secure, as I and th'Empire shall be In thy care, Angell Guardian of Persia. Mah. Not all the Gods could so oblige me. Heavens! What anxious care, what service, what endeavours, Can ere requite such favours! But, Sir, I Am conscious of mine own defects, for such A Province, that requires the ablest man; A man, A God Phœbus himself to rule it; A rule as glorious as his flaming Throne. Abb. Thou art modest ALY-BEG. He is most fit Who we dare trust, and that is thee my MHOMET ABBAS, MAHOMET-ALLYBEG, FARRABAN, Two THEEVES, OFFICERS. Who have you brought into our presence (Dogs) And are the sons of filth and povertie Fit objects for our eye? 2 Theev. Mercy, O mercy! Far. An't please your Majesty, these two were soldiers. Ran from their colours hither, and turn'd Theeves, They rob'd ith'Court it selfe, my chamber. Theev. Mercy. Abb. 'Twere to disgrace our mercy to bestow her Vpon such vagabonds, who besides your Theft, And cowardly sulking from the Camp, shall die, If but for so disgracing, so prophaning Our Court, with such base rags, and bands of vermine Compounds of Oyle and stench! spawn of a Toad! Are these weeds for a Court? Or is our Marble To be polluted with your dust and sweat? Rascalls! spued out of Gaoles and Charnel houses! Rotten already! that bear graves about you! Go, Officers, away with them to death. 'Tis plain they are Theeves, they've rob'd some of their fellowes Long since hung up in chains, of those foul raggs, That danc'd ith'air many a frosty night. Yet, that they may die neatlier then they liv'd, Give them new Coats, then dragg'd out of the Town, Impale them high on stakes, thrust through their bodies. 1 Thee. This may thank you could keep the dore no better. 2 Thee. T'may thank us both, for robbing without killing. “They're wise that make sure work. Mah. Tis true. Abb. Away. Mah. (Tis a good Prologue this to his sons Tragedy.) [Aside. Attend without there, FARRABAN, I've somewhat To move the King, you may be usefull in, Be within call. Far. I will, my honoured Lord. ABBAS, MAHOMET-ALLYBEG. Drawes not the time on, you expect the Prince in? Mah. Yes. How will you that he be entertain'd? Abb. How entertain'd? why, how, but with a bowstring? Is't not decreed? Entice the trusty Son From his Eccliptick line, he shall obey Your beck, and wander from his sphear, ere I From my resolves. Mah. Admired Constancy! Abb. Set you some spy of faith 'gainst his arrivall, There let him stay him to attend my comming; Then give us notice, and thou and I will plant Our selves in secret to behold the justice; To act which, get seven Executioners Deaf, dumb, and dextrous to rush in upon him; So all Rebellions shall be strangled in him: Th'Hydra of Treason at one pluck shall lose Her numerous heads, and we our fears, and be For ever cured of all jealousie. Mah. Ile appoint FARRABAN to be his last Master of Ceremonies. FARRABAN, MAHOMET-ALLYBEG, FARRABAN. Which is the way to rise at Court, thinkst thou? Far. T'obey and please. Mah. Right, and thou art ambitious. Far. What do I here else? Mah. Whither tends thy aime? Give me the utmost height of thy aspiring. Far. Troth there you pose me; for “Our thoughts still rise “As our estates and power; the avarice “Of honour is no lesse insatiable “Then that of gold.—But for the present, I Know mine own wish, and so shall you my Lord. When I walk by the Cittadell, so strong, So stately, that claimes reverence from mine eye, I think if I had but the government Of that, I should be happy enough to pitty The grand Signior, and envy him no more. Mah. The government oth'Castle! is that all? Thou art too modest. Far. Good my Lord, do'nt scoffe me. Mah. I am in earnest,—thou shalt have it FARRABAN, The King has but one piece of Service for thee, Do that, and thou art Governour. Far. If I Can do't, tis done. Mah. Come, Ile instruct thee how. FLORADELLA, CLOE. Come, why staid you so long abroad this morning? You'l never leave your Gossiping till you Be double rib'd, as GLAVCA was, and then You may go seek a Father for't: 'bove all things Beware of a great belly; there is losse Of time, and losse of sport in't, besides trouble. Clo. O Madam, I can make sirrup of Savin, My selfe; and twenty tricks I have besides. Here is the book EARINA promis'd you. Flo. What, ARETINE, so famous for his postures! Let's see it.—Were you at ERINA's house, Or sent she this? Clo. I was there Madam, and Had the luck too, to see her fine new servant. Flo. What for a creature is't? Clo. A pretty silk-worm. Flo. How happy am I therein 'bove the rest, That dote on sleeked limbs, and finest bloud, Looking but for couch comforts, not aspiring The godlike ornament of a crown! let them Melt in their youngsters armes, Ile sacrifice To hair and bristles, cling to MAHOMET, Or hug a coffin to arrive at honour— Me thinks this Purruck leans to th'left hand somewhat, Clo. No Madam, 'tis well set, and rarely sented. I would we'd more of the prepared Pomatum, And powder I bought last. Flo. What talk's most rife Abroad, wench? Clo. That my Lord MAHOMET is sworn Lord Treasurer, he's now the only Sun Next to the King, of greatest light. Flo. He shall Ecclips him one day.—What do you now? Clo. This fucus Is laid too thick, Ile mend it with my scarlet. Flo. Have you got Puppy Dogs, and an after burden? Clo. Yes. Flo. Well—distill them then with care—my Lord. MAHOMET-ALLYBEG, FLORADELLA, CLOE. Why; this is as it should be, now my beauty Displaies her lustre, throwing sweets and graces About the place, her selfe being as the spring, A box wherein all sweets compacted lie. Flo. This spring, Sir, owes it selfe but to your beams. I wish you joy, Sir, of your treasurership, Mah. A step, that's but a step to a greater height. I've something more to tell thee, that is fit For thy ear only. Flo. CLOE, prethe leave us. Clo. (Now can't I for my soul but listen, I Have such an itch of novelty) Mah. Come my dear, Aside, she places her selfe behind the hangings to listen. Art ready to ascend thy throne? hast practised To Queen it with a Majesty? seest thou not All creatures bow in homage to thy foot? And Princes throng into thy set of servants? Clo. (This is fine Pageantry, would it were reall. O how I should be courted!) Flo. Jeast not, jeast not, How proceed you? Mah. Smoothly, the dreaded Prince Is on's last journey; an hour brings him hither, An other sends him Elizium. The army kicks at BALTAZAR's command, And pines for th'Prince; the two Dukes fume and fret Like Lions caught in toiles or Buls in nets, Where strugling but intangles them the more. Since the King can't trust these men thus inrag'd, Nor knowes he where to serve himselfe of others; He means a league with th'Turk, so falls this army, And leaves him no force to oppose my rise. He shew'd me his thoughts of outing ELCHEE From his vice-royship of Hircania, And stout EMANGOLY from his of Shiras. I having hopes of ELCHEE, knew to out him Were to disable him to do me service; So wrought him to continue the gelden Duke, But not without a spice of his displeasure, Forbidding him the Court, and this will rub His former wounds, and make him fitter for me To work upon; for “Nothing like disgrace “And discontent drive men into rebellion. EMANGOLY I know too wise and haughty For my use so did close with his suspition, To lay him by; there I've disarm'd a foe, And the most Potent too in the whole Empire. To hinder his gath'ring or abetting Factions, We'l to this Town confine him, to have him in Our eye, and keep his friends from herding with him. Clo. (Faire fall that Counsell, I shall see my Sweetheart Again then,—O dear VASCO!—Well, I'l venture Catching th'other cold, with sitting up To let thee in at the back door a nights. Lord, I'm so marriage-minded o'the suddaine!) Flo. I'm musing who shall be preferr'd to Shiras, If any of that faction should step up, T'were but the worse: be that your care to hinder. Mah. Who cleares a field of thornes, but meanes to reap The crop? nor had I counsell'd his remove, But that the King proffer'd his place to me: Whereby th'best halfe of my designe is acted. “For he that gives the means unto another, ‘To become powerfull, undoes himselfe. Flo. That word gives me new spirits. O my joy! Let me embrace thee, sweet; all our contrivements That sounded hard before, are easie now. Nor will we rest in our first project: we Will stretch our conquest farther, till no names But onely ours, be heard from Pole to Pole. Mah. This hand was never made for to grasp less Then the whole world, one Scepter cannot fill it: Thou shalt reward thy women all with Kingdoms— Clo. (Hei, ho, my heart! then I shall be a Queen.) Mah. And give whole Isles in dowry with thy Maidens: The meanest drudge that toyleth in thy service, Shall sweep his Oven with MORAT'S Horsetayle standard: My Ganymeds and Lackies I'l prefer To Provinces, and give a City to My Grooms for every time they hold my stirrop. I'l ride upon tame Unicornes, and thou Shalt have thy Charriot drawn by yoaked Lions: My slaves shall play at foot-ball with the crowns Of their own conquer'd Kings, whose blooming daughters Shall sue to wait, some 'mongst thy maids, and some To be entertain'd in my Serraglio. Flo. Why should not I have a Serraglio too, For men and boyes? I prethee let me build one. Clo. (That would be fine i'faith, I love variety.) Mah. No, no, my sweet, thou must keep all for me. Flo. Fie, this ingrossememt is but meer conceipt: Do's the sweet spring lesse cool, less fair appear, When many thirsts are quench'd in her, then when But one has drank? find you not the same sweets, When more besides your selfe have smelt your Rose? Mah. Well, I'l not press the Dove's example to thee, Or geniall Vine, but give thee the free reins, Let thy selfe loose to pleasures. Flo. We'l make poor Ingenuous luxury in all her Arts. Mah. Mean while, we'l re-erect our marble City, Persepolis, far fairer then her founder SOSARINUS, or rather JAMSHET meant her; Or then she was indeed when the mad Greek Swimming in riot, at fair THAIS Counsell, Did wrapt her pride about with wastfull flames. There our bright Pallace I'l repair, and give The forty Towers new Resurrection, From their forgotten rubbish Th'hundred Pillars Of white and shining marble, shall again Erect their pollish'd heads, not to support APOLLO, as of old, but thy fair statue, And mine, adored of the prostrate world. Flo. We'l lie on Beds of Gold and Ivory, Richer then that Bythinian PYTHIUS gave, Our great DARIUS: Golden Vines shall shade us, Studded with Pearls, whose artificiall clusters Shall be the freshest Rubies. Thus we'l tyre Nature and Art, and our selves too, with pleasures. Mah. I've a pretence shall gaine even MIRZA'S friends. 'Tis that I onely aim at, the Protection Of young SOFFIE, whom they cannot think safe In's Grandsires hands, seeing his hate to's Father: Do you pretend no other to the Ladies. At first, to name my selfe were gross and open. Flo. Great soul of wit! that cannot chuse but take them, Some oth'great Ladies I've with visits courted, With presents some, all with unusuall favours: So that they seem to stand expecting something I'd have them doe, which when the Prince is gone, They being thus prepared, they shall have. T'were good you won the Muftie to your purpose; And some o'th'Abdalls, that at publique meetings, And market Lectures, may expound the Text Oth'Alchorar, according to your Comment. Good cheer is bait enough for these poore spirits, Fil them with that, and the bagpipes will sound What Tune you'l turn them to, when they are full: Bid them inveigh against the Tyranny They now groan under: promise silken Yoaks, And easie burdens in your Government. Pretend a Reformation of the Law, To take down all illegal Courts and Taxes: To make all Lands and goods Hereditary, So that the Persian being rich in Marble, Need never more to build with unburnt clay. Promise a Toleration of all Religions, to ease tender Consciences, Or Jew or Christian, but yet persecute The Christian still; it is a spreading Sect, And where it gets a foot draws in the body: What though your word's not kept? your ends obtain'd, Y'are too great to be taxt with breach of promise. Mah. 'Tis true, great wit, these mercenary Priests Are the best fire-brands, such I've ready kindled, They are at work in every Conventicle, Their empty heads are Drums, and their hoarse voyces Are Trumpets to the war: then, when no longer The people will believe, I shall be able To force them to't: Power and Policy, “Are the two Poles a Kingdom turns upon. Flo. More Policy not MERCURY can boast; O that your power were equall! as to that: What think you of the Horse-guard I propounded? Mah. I do intend it, when I've money for't. Flo. I've twenty thousand Tomaynes towards it. Mah. (This want of money now was well pretended.) [aside. As many thanks, my sweet, I will returne thee, For every piece a Crown, (a nooze I should say.) [aside. Clo. Base man! well, I'l prevent thy treachery. Mah. By this the King expects me, but my deare, First let me leave my soul upon thy lips. Clo. (Out Crocodile! he'l lick off all her paint too.) Mah. Adieu my Queen, my Goddess, more, my Love. Flo. My Prince, my MAHOMET, my best of wishes, And their accomplishments attend thee ever. FARRABAN. And must the brave Prince die? who would love vertue! That sure has no reward, and is but name! Could vertuous valour, and all daring goodnesse, A noble scorn of Fortune and her frowns, Whole Hecatombes of Vowes and Prayers, sent Climbing to Heaven on pious breath, enough To scale it, and force blessings from the Gods: Could Countries love, or Persias Genius wrest From ruthless ATROPOS the impartial sheares, Then had'st thou liv'd, great MIRZA, and outliv'd The smooth-tongu'd Greek. O let not this be knowne In Balsora, nor publish'd in Bizantium, Lest the Arabian triumphs, and the daughters Of ACHMET, sing the fall o'th'Persian glory. But why waile I his fall that is my rising? “Kings great intents are to be serv'd, not searcht: But would he'd us'd some other instrument: Yet th'Cittadell is worth the paines I take for't. He comes,—I'm hardly bad enough for this service. MIRZA, FARRABAN, PAGE. Now FARRABAN. Far. Long live your Highnesse, you Are well return'd. Sir, I am sent from th'King, To let you know, that since 't was private businesse Urg'd him to call you up, he thinks it best You'd not appear in Court, or make your comming Publique, now when your Army so much needs you: And since a suddaine griefe late fallen upon him, Makes him unfit for businesse; he desires You'd repose here, till himselfe comes to visit, And give you your dispatch, which he assures Your grace shall be as soon as he can get Leave of's Disease to venture into th'air. Mir. Thou giv'st me joy and sorrow FARABAN; Sorrow, to heare his Majestie wants health; And joy, in hope of quick dispatch, because My Army's need of me, and my desire To be with them are alike great and urgent. My humble duty to his Majestie I'l here attend him, and imploy the time In prayers for his health. Far. Heavens keep your highness, For Earth sha'nt long I'm sure. [Secret. Pag. Your Highness said, You'd have your Scimitar, new set on edge, Whilst here you stay, if't please you, 't may be done. Mir. That's well remembr'd, the stout trusty blade, That at one blow has cut an Asinego Asunder like a threed, is drunk and glutted With Ottoman blood; it cuts not now, but bruises. Take it, and giv't an edge, but be'nt long absent, Mean while a nap shall settle my toss'd braine, He lies down upon a Couch to sleep. ABBAS, MAHOMET, ALLYBEG, MIRZA. They peep in from behind the hangings. He sleeps.—One blow will make yon sleep eternall. Mah. He is the fitter for your purpose, farther From opposition. Abb. But 'tis cowardly, To strike a man sleeping. Mah. We that stick not For vertues selfe must not regard her shadow, Fame and repute; no heed what honour saies, State saies it, and state is the power we serve. Abb. A handsome man! 'tis pitty! Mah. Do you soften? Abb. Relent a little; 'las, against a showre Of so great blood, what Marble but relents! Mah. You have your choice yet, whether you or he Shall passe the Stygian sound first. Do, do, strain Courtesie with him; say, my flower of youth Has shed the leaves, thine flourishes in glory: Live thine own time out MIRZA, and mine too. Abb. No, he must fall; yet falls he not my crime, But Tyrant Necessities, that knoweth No law, not those of justice, nor of nature. Mah. Now y'are your selfe again. Mir. Skirt all along The trenches with the Horse. Mah. Hark! hark! he dreams Nothing but war; talks sleeping or awake, Nothing but blood and wounds. Mir. Remember but That I am MIRZA, you Persians. Mah. Is this Nothing? Abb. An overflow of dangerous valour. ABBAS, MAHOMET-ALLYBEG, MIRZA, seven Mutes. The King, and Mah. still behind the hangings. Ah! Mah. See your selfe and crowns rescu'd from danger. The Mutes with bow-strings in their hands, they make softly towards the Prince. Deaths journey-men ready to seize your fear. Abb. Sad necessary evill! Mah. Shut but your eye And when you op't again. you'l see no Rivall. Mir. Where, wher's the opposition made? He starts up, the executioners fly back. Mah. He wakes. Abb. There's danger in his fury, and quick death In every look. Mir. Blesse me! what do I see! I am betrayed! Mah. I warrant you. Mir. Treason! Treason! Mah. I, I, call till your lungs crack. Mir. Hell, and furies! What Devill made me send away my sword, To fall a tame dull sacrifice to treason? Mah. Persia's good Genius. Mir. Yet the lower shades Shall never see my Ghost come unattended. They fly upon him, and throw their noozes towards his neck. “Fury nere wanted weapons. He taks up a stool to ward and fight with. Abb. O that I Could save him, and be safe my selfe! Mah. You cannot. Mir. Go you dull dog, tell RADAMANTH I come— He knocks down one of the executioners. And you—bid CHARON wait me with his boat.— [He kils another. How will it yrk my Ghost to fall without My full revenge?—could every blow I deal Light on my cruell Father—the curs'd cause Of my base murder—I should die contented— As in th'embraces of my dearest friends. Mah. You see Sir, what you were to trust to from him. Abb. would I had nere deserv'd it. Mir. And you too, Go you,—and tell my Grandsire, and my Vncle He kills another. I come—to keep them company,—we'l sit On Acharons banks,—under a fatal yew,— Counting the murders—of my Tyrant Father.— Ah too unnaturall Father!—Our pale Ghosts By turnes shall vex thee.—Is this private businesse! Curses and horrour dog thee to thy Hell.— ABBAS!—O ABBAS—forget not—that I die— I die—the complement of thy Tyranny. Wearied with resistance, he fals, and faints, the other 4 executioners proceed to strangle him, when the King comes out, and takes them off. Abb. I can no longer hold, I feel his torment. Mah. Inconstant! Abb. MAHOMET, help me rescue him, And call him back from the infernall shades. Mah. Faith Sir, I'me deep ith'gout I cannot struggle. Abb. MIRZA, O MIRZA, speak, thy father calls. Mir. My murderer. Abb. O he lives he lives, help! help! Mah. I am very lame—Pox o'these bunglers, would [Aside. He had kil'd them all. Abb.

'Las Sir, we cannot Bring him again oth'sudden; he's but swounded, His spirits must have time to Rally. But what Will do with him? do you think this injury Will ever be forgotten? will you restore him? Abb. No, yet he lives, though in a dungeon.—Bind him Lest he recovers.—Now to make him henceforth Incapable of giving me more trouble, Ile have a flaming steel be drawn before His eyes, to take away his sight. Mah. Do't then Ere he recovers, you'l not rule him else. Abb. Be it your care FARRABAN and SELEUCUS. Sell. It shall. Abb. Then guard him to the Citadell. Stay FARRABAN, you I've made Governour. Seleucus and the Mutes carry out the Prince, still in his swound. Where's his commission MAHOMET? Mah. Here my Liege. You see Sir I was mindfull of my word. Far. Your trust shall never be deceiv'd by me. Abb. Ward the Prince up, but hinder not his friends Th'accesse of visits; yet observe who comes; So shall we know the faction by degrees.

In villany, and fit for any service. At first I startled, and my blood recoil'd. “None are oth'sudden highly good or bad; “By time and practise are crafts-masters made. Abb. MAHOMET, compile a Proclamation Declaring my just fears and jealousies Of his exorbitant rise, and growing faction. This timely mercy will possesse the world That I am only carefull, and not cruell. And that 'tis not the person but the treason I punish. “Tyranny may be gilt with reason. MAHOMET-ALLYBEG. Inconstant dotard! canst thou never sleep And wake again firm in the same resolve! Well, thou but leav'st for me to do, what thou Wouldst have, but could'st not; nor shall this faint rub, Thy cowardise cast in my way, impede My strong-cast bowl, but the more surely lead It to th'intended Jack, that is, thy head. NYMPHADORA, FATYMA, IFFIDA. What mists are these that dwell about mine eyes To cheat me into slumbers! as if rest (The cure of troubled minds) meant to compose The tumults of my brain, and sleep repair My broken senses, softly by distilling Her gentle balm upon my wounded thoughts! When I no sooner do obey, and throw My cares on her, but melancholy keeps Sad orgies in my head, shuffling again My senses with pale frights, and gastly dreams, Full fraught with horrour and black Tragedie, Turning to poyson what soft sleep meant balsom!

Me thought I saw my Prince with gastly looks, Squallid and bloody, beckon me away. And then the Sun with bloody countenance seem'd To set upon his head, and a thick cloud Invelop'd him in her dark misty womb. Portents! portents of some dire fate to come. Fat. Madam, alas how oft have you chid me For crying at sad dreams? last night, me thought I saw an eagle pick his chickens eyes out, And could have wept for't, but I soon forgat it. Nym.

See where she comes, waited by all the Graces! Oly. With Innocence cast about her as a Dresse: Yet wears she sorrow in her face. Abb. But mixt With such a sweetnesse, as gives sorrow beauty. Come my faire Grand-childe, welcome to our Court: We mean to have thee here, as a choice Jewel Set to th'advantage, to be seen and prais'd; Madam OLYMPA is your Governesse. Fat. Then sir, my first suit to her is, that I May see my Father, if not still wait on him. Abb. Deny her nothing, but make quick return, A Prison is no shrine for such a goodnesse. Oly. Come Madam, I'l attend you to his Highnesse. Abb. Doe—and SELEUCUS, hast thee down to Larr, Be happy in thy Government let us know What's fit more to be done there? and how they Take this great change of state. Sel. I will my Leige. SELEUCUS. You soon will know what you have done, and what You should have left undone, when 'tis too late. What Prince would have disarm'd himself of so Trusty a strength! and to his watchfull foe, Laid himselfe open thus but one in whom Strict justice would have that impartiall doom Of Tyrants to be proved, “Him whom fate “Meanes to destroy, she doth infatuate. MIRZA, PAGE, FARRABAN. Blinded and led by his Page. The empty nothing of our worldly greatnesse! Pag. O that your trusty Scimiter had stuck Acrosse my heart, when I depriv'd you of it! Arm'd but with that, the Sons of earth had felt Their brothers fortune that made head 'gainst JOVE. Mir. Remember it no more sweet youth, alas! Hell and dire Treason call'd, call'd in the voyce Of love, the fiend ith'Cherubins disguize, (Safest disguize, but cruellest!) I came led By powerfull Fate to my destruction, And this by chance the wrathfull Powers made joyne To pluck me down. So, “To a falling man, “Every thing gives a thrust to hast his ruine. Who's that? Pag. 'Tis FARRABAN your Goaler sir. Mir. The Devills setting Dog! guide me but to him, My wrathfull arms shall crush out his black soule. Pag. Alas! Sir, your revenge is toothlesse, hear him 'Twill lesse exasperate. Far. NYMPHADORA, sir, Your Princesse comes to see you. Mir. Can that name Come in thy mouth, and not convert thee? wretch! MIRZA, NYMPHADORA, SOFFIE, IFFIDA, PAGE. O heavens! and has the Kite got that Dove too Into his fangs! the Gods have sure forgot All justice, and hurle plagues about at random! Nym. Goodness! what do I see!—O, that I still Did not onely dreame!—O— Iff. Ah! alas! sweet Madam! She's swounded! help me DORIDO. Frighted to see the Prince blind, she swounds. They chafe her. Mir. What Tyrant Planet did rage, not raign, at my curs'd birth! Too cruell heavens, to ply me thus with wounds? Do harsh JOVE, do, shoot, shoot again, but know, If thou spendst many Darts upon me more, Thou'lt soon disarm thy selfe.—Is not my woe Enough, without addition of hers To sink me to the Centre! Lead, O lead me To her, my comfort once, but now my sorrow, That I may revive her with fervent kisses, Or mix with hers my dying breath. Pag. Take heed sir. Mir. O NYMPHADORA speak, thy MIRZA calls Still MIRZA, and still thine. O speak, speak quickly, Lest griefe before thou speak'st, puts me past hearing. My name was once belov'd, and powerfull with thee. Nym. Who, O who calls me from the pleasant shades? Mir. Thy MIRZA dearest, 'tis thy MIRZA calls thee. Nym. O the vast power of that Charm! where is he? Bless me—what see I?—Heavens, let me returne To that sweet Grove, there stood my MIRZA for me, Glorious and bright, and ile to him againe. Iff. Alas, She's gone againe—sweet SOFFIE Speake to her. Mir. Ah! and is he here too! Sof. Madam, ah Madam, SOFFIE never ask'd Ought yet of you in vaine. Mir. Heaven is proud T'have got so pure a soule, and vowes to keep it. Iff. Here comes poor FATIMA too. Sof. Madam,—FATIMA. MIRZA, SOFFIE, NYMPHADORA FATIMA, IFFIDA, PAGE. O ye infernall Powers! your conquest is Compleat ore me, why kill you me no faster? But crucifie me thus with lingring tortures? I'l do't my selfe—and never be beholding To you for my last rest BAIAZET'S Cage Arm'd him with high resolves: my woe's as great, As powerfull. He throwes himself downe, and beats his head on the stone. Fat. O Gods! Pag. Sir, sir, the Princesse Sweet FATIMA cling you to him, to hinder His violence to himselfe. Fat. O eyes! what see you. Sof. O choice of bitter sights. Fat. Wer'nt one enough, To break so soft a heart as mine. O Father! O Mother! whither shall I turne me first? Which first bewaile, or add my losse to yours? O that I could redeem his life with mine! Sof. Or I with my blood randsome hers 'twould be A noble payment for the breath she lent me. Mir. Oh—oh!— Nym. Ah! what strong groans are those? Sof. 'Tis MIRZA dies, Madam, 'tis MIRZA dies, Infected with your griefe. Nym. No MIRZA is Immortall as his Vertue!—O what cheats Are these! even now I left him in Elizium, Yet now I find him here squallid and bloudy, As in my dream— Iff. Madam, put off your fright, Assist now his recovery. Nym. O my MIRZA! Which wound shall I first kiss? here? this? or that? In silent streams below now dost thou bath Thy bleeding wounds—but, ah! why dost thou seek. To wash them any where but in my eyes? See! see! they flow! These tears when once I dropt Into thy hurts, when thou cam'st hot from conquest, Thou didst call balme. Ah! they are still as warm, As clear, and flow as free. See, see! I'de weep All my whole moisture into cures couldst thou But feel it, yet I'l weep because thou dost not. Ah, ah! thou dost not!—Thou art now possess'd Of thy fresh Grove, and there to fame deliver'st Thy NYMPHADORA'S Name; or on the rind Of some faire Tree, perhaps thou now ingrav'st it, Then hugg'st thou the fresh bark, and askest pardon For wounding it with thy beloved Letters. O'wake, 'wake dearest, and embrace the substance. Mir. Where,-O-where am I? Fat. O thank Heaven he lives. Nym. Th'art in my Arms, thy NYMPHADORA'S Armes; Where, O that thou hadst ever been, or now At least may ever be. Mir. No, no, I am not, I'm in the Torrid Zone, right O right under The vehement Line—Water-O-water quickly.— What Devill has in my sleep, thrown me to Affrick? O for a River, though 'twere Acheron, Or Styx its selfe to bath in. Nym. Alas he burns, He's high in a strong feavour. Iff. Madam that Will find an easie cure, get him to rest; That's the first step to health in a distemper. Mir. Ah me! What COLCHIS, what Thessalian Hag Thus tortures me, poor wretch, with Magick charms, And boyles my guts in such a scorching flame, Melting my marrow as her wax dissolves! Nym. Alas dear Prince! best try to rest my Lord. Mir. To Lybian Lions TITAN is more mild, Then thus to rage. VULCAN feeles no such heat At's glowing forge. Neither is Ætra's selfe So scalding, when she vomits burning coles. Nym. O, I will sigh my soul to air to cool thee. Mir. O, who put HERCULES shirt on me? I feel The poison work, and all my veins boyl high With Centaur's blood. Fat. That I could weep, till like ÆGIRIA I thaw'd into a fountain To cool him! Sof. Might I ACIS like melt to a stream. Mir. Pretty obedience!—Fortunate PROMETHEUS, Though thy eternall entrailes still should feed A thousand Eagles! the kind Caucasus Benums with cold; O that I might with thee Vnder that hill, handle eternall frost, Roul in perpetuall snow to quench my fires, And slake my parch'd soul with continuall Ice! Iff. Dear Madam, get him in. Nym. O that I could! Mir. Or might I still thirst, TANTALUS with thee, So I might alwaies bath in thy cool River, For O I burn, I burn, the dog-star rules me, And feeds his raging fires on all my joynts. Nym. Wilt in to rest? Mir. 'Tis dog-daies every where, And Affrick.—Here ye BELIDES, here powre On me, kind sisters, your perpetuall vialls.— There is an impious nation that is said To stuffe with human flesh their greedy womb, O they expect me, and are now devouring My roasted Liver; all my members broile, And ready be THYESTES for thy Table.— Nym. Page, try to lift him up, softly, O softly. Mir. O I am stifled in hot glowing brasse! I low, shut up in dire PERILLUS Bull.— Away Dragons, you scald me with your breath. [He struggles Nym. Stay yet. Mir. Nought see I 'fore mine eyes but flames, And towring Pyramids of eternall fire. What food can serve such flames! alas! what mines Of Bitumen and Sulphur have I in me, That thus my loyns consume without a pile. Iff. Alas! this talking heightens his distemper. Nym. It does,—come try to bear him quickly in. Once well, he will forgive it. Mir. I melt! I melt! Ah! mine own selfe am mine own funerall fire. FLORADELLA, MAHOMET-ALLYBEG. Bungling Puppies! could not twitch hard enough When once they'd got him down! What will you do now? Step on, or back, or alter the whole machin Of the contrivement? Mah. On, my fair, on: “These little difficulties indear great actions “To noble minds; they are weak soules fall or stumble “At rubs cast in their way to try their strength. The peace I know by this time is patcht up, And the bold factious Troops disbanded all. The Town anon will swarm with idle Souldiers, That will, like fish lie basking in the Sun, And die, when all the water, their element, Is let out from them, I'me for ELCHEF first. Flo. I for OLYMPA, and EARINA. Mah. Presse hard For liberall lones of money, plate, or Jewells, Or any of their fine superfluities, They'l help t'augment the heap. Possesse them strongly That I intend to rescue the brave Prince And SOFFIE. Flo. You've instructed me enough. Mah. Keep hid the Serpent, Lure with the Dove: “No Treason is like that goes mas'kd like love. CHORUS. What is it Heavens, you suffer here? As if that vices malice were unbounded, All vertues Laws inverted are, And the just be by the unjust confounded. 'Tis punishable to speak reason, Now reason and loyaltie are out of fashion, And Tyranny and Treason Have all the vogue in this besotted Nation. He that our great Palladium was, No lesse our strength and bulwark, then our glory, A prey to rampant malice lies, Whose fall almost, the doers selves makes sorry. His innocent issue suffer too, Not laid so close up as a priz'd treasure; But to shew what their rage can do, And that reason ruleth not their acts, but pleasure. His noble friends, that whilst they wore I'th field his purple, could deaths selfe have daunted, Men, that a crime, then death, fear more, Suffer for crimes wherewith they'r unacquainted. Some to strickt bounds confined are, Some to remote; all judg'd without due tryall: The cause, fond jealousie and fear, Strange state, that fears such subjects as are loyall! Whilst they that mean the rape o'th state, Swim in smooth oyle, and wallow in all riot, Intit'ling their black deeds to fate, And put bad men in armes, to keep good quiet. O whither doth the precipice Of evill hurry men of base condition! Made drunken with unjust successe, They all the world grasp in their vast ambition. Seest thou not JOVE rebellions scope? 'Lesse thy quick vengeance stopps their sudden rising, They'l, like their elder brothers, hope To depose thee too, and dare heavens surprising. Hear, O JOVE, hear their blasphemies, How all their wickednesse on thee they father. Cheating the world with pious lies, Saying, their rules from thy instinct they gather. Dost thou not hear it boldly said, JOVE bids us break all antient laws asunder? (At the dire speech ASTRÆ fled) Or hearing it, why sleeps so long thy Thunder? Was it not worth one bolt to save Him, who the world thy truest copy deem'd? Whom all good men in reverence have, Who thy laws highly, as we his, esteem'd? Whom wilt not tempt, when these, they see The great prosperitie of evill secures, Away from down-trod right to flee? When wrong, with the fair bait, successe, allures? So would it be, but that there are A wiser few, that know on high there fitteth O'th world, an upright Governour, And every thing is best that he permitteth. “We know a punishment it be “To evill to prosper, nor shall long endure. “The wicked's false prosperitie, “Though justice slowly moves, she striketh sure.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act IIII. ABBAS, BELTAZAR. Come BELTAZAR, how have you us'd your power? Bel. May't please your Majestie, a mutuall league Offensive and defensive we could not Obtain, but upon tearmes too low for us. The Turk is yet too high, and stands upon Rendition of those Townes you hold of his, Which would disfurnish you of many men Fit for your other wars; so'a Truce is all We've made, but so long, 'tmay be call'd a peace, 'Tis for three years. Abb. ‘These truces yet in war “Are only like the well daies in an Ague, “Short intervalls of health, that flatter us “Into debauch, and make the next fit worse. “Nor should we suffer a disorder follow “To save a war, because that war's not sav'd, “But only put off to our disadvantage.— But how took our stout Captains their casheering? Bel. full heavily and mutter'd mutiny. EMANGOLY here at the Town was met With your arrest, and seisure of his places. Which he seem'd to put off with no more trouble Then he would do his Armes after a march, Or a hard charge, to take a nap of sleep. Abb. Gunning dissembler! How took ELCHEE His banishment from Court? Bel. As a school-boy That has plaid treuant, and hears his Master's angry. Abb. There's hopes of him; but th'other is quite lost. ABBAS, FATYMA, BELTAZAR. What's that my FATYMA. Fat. 'Tis a petition From a poor subject, wrong'd by a great Lord, Too strong for him to struggle with at Law, Nor has he wherewithall to pay for justice. Bel. The case holds in himselfe, and his brave Son. [aside. Abb. Our justice, FATYMA, shall be given, not sold. 'Twas wisely done, who ere he be, to send it By thy hand, (sweet) of all the deerest to me. 'Tis granted. Fat. Heaven will pay the early mercy. Abb. Take you the scrowle, BELTAZAR, and see right done. ABBAS, FATYMA. But child thou shew'st thy selfe as unconcern'd At all the pleasures of the Court, and seemst A discontent. Fat. Alas Sir, how can I Relish these toyes, when my poor Father pines And raves, mewd up in Prison? Is the daughter Fit for a Court, and Father, Mother, brother But for a dungeon?— [She weeps. Abb. Come, these thoughts will over, As time and more discretion wins upon thee. Its fit thou be as free from the reward Of his foul treasons, as thou wert from them. He may be yet restor'd; how ere, his Name, Though stain'd with this one blot, shall ever stand Full and Majestick in great Historie, For noble acts yet shall those Histories And after times boast thee his chiefest Act, That fame him most.—But which of all the pleasures That court thee here, dost thou most favour child? Fat. Musick; it feeds my melancholy, and Brings Paradise into my thoughts. OLYMPA Tells me the soul is only harmony, And Musick built the world. Abb. Come child, within Thou shalt have some shall please thee. Fat. 'T must be sad then. MAHOMET-ALLYBEG, ELCHEE. He was indeed the very soul of war, The thunderbolt: had TYPÆUS fought like him, Great JOVE had been his Prisoner. Elc. Heavens! whose ears Have not his Trumpets tingled in! what fears In Persia's foes, have his brac'd Drums awak'd! What enemies face has not his hand besmear'd With blood and glorious dust! what land, what fields Has not his sword manur'd with hostile blood! Whose triumphs have not his deafned! his, heard To, and beyond Byzantiums walls of fire! Mah. But now, O lost, lost is our hope, our glory, And fortune of our name, except— Elc. Except! My Lord, and can yet all the Gods, if they Should sit in counsell, form a remedie? Mah. Yes, yes, dear ELCHEE, there's a way yet open To rescue Persia's glory, and our comfort. Elc. O speak it, and be our good Genius. Mah. And 'tis, my Lord, a way wherein the Love I bear to you, would have you high and eminent. Nature and vertue have done their parts in you, And Art and education better'd both, The dignities and honours that you hold Are no more then your birth assign'd you to, Were your parts lesse. I'd have those scores of merit You've put upon the age, paid double to you, But how the course the King now takes, will do it, Your new disgrace at Court assures you; So that if justice, honour, or endearments, Were silent all, the many disobligements The King has given you, call you loud enough To th'Princes Party. Elc. I, my Lord, have studied Not to divide my soveraigne from himselfe, His interest, and the Princes, I count one, How ere his anger has now sever'd them. And were I once assured in my reason, That his dis-favour of the Prince were just, I'd onely mourn his fall, as much from Vertue, As from his honours. Mah. 'Tis but the jealousie Of's guilty mind, perswades this cruelty To th'Prince, and to himselfe, he being his hope. Good JOVE! what fears, what doubtful apprehensions Do wicked Actions leave in cruell minds! His Fathers Ghost, and Brothers haunt him daily, And MIRZA he thinks, must needs requite the blows He gave to them. Nor will this humour cease, But grow upon him still with its fond Nurse, Old testy age, that's subject in its self, To fears and doubts, and sees all dangers double. Elc. That's his disease, my Lord, but now the cure? Mah. What, but a hard, and seeming violent one? Why may'nt you martiall men, rally your powers, Free the brave Prince, secure his hopefull Son, And then maintain't, and force his frenzy from him? Elc. That looks too like Rebellion. Mah. O successe! “Is a rare paint, that which succeeds is good, “When the same Action, if it failes, is naught. Elc. Indeed would the young SOFFIE were safe. Mah. To wish it onely is but womanish, Attempt it, and he is. Think but my Lord, The innocent Babe calls from his prison to us, And are these hands that never could deserve them, So soon for fetters? Believe it, DAMOCLES sword Hung not by a less threed, then the Kings doth Ore that sweet hope of Persia, one mad fit Destroyes the race and glory of the Empire. He grows apace, and the old Tyrant knows, “The children, whose Parents have been wrong'd, “Inherit all their hatred, and are dangerous: What factions then, what numbers of Pretenders Will not with force assert their fancied Titles? And shalt thou, fairest Mother Persia, be Torn by the factious hands of thine own Children? Forbid it Heaven. Elc. MIRZA'S deserts plead too. Mah. Yes, and that loud: shall I that spar'd no blood, No toyl, dear quondam Souldiers, to adorne Your heads with Palm, your memories with fame, Now pine, and find no courteous hand will knock My unworthy shackles off? Is Honour, Love, And Gratitude, all blinded with me too? Elc. Who should begin? Mah. (It works, it works) why you, Or I, or any body; well begun The work's more then halfe ended. A small force, And handsome Declaration, will find none Such Enemies to themselves as to oppose: Nor do the Princes high deserts, his Sons Apparant danger, or our Honours call Louder then our own safeties, they are too At stake: He whose wild rage could reach a Father, Brother, Son, and I may say, a Grand-child, Will not spare us: but you, or I, or any, May daily feed the monster of his fury. Elc. 'Tis but too probable: like a mad man he'l Hurl stones at all alike. Mah. And like a mad-man His present state appears, with sorrow, I See him like one distracted, about to murder His best friends, and himselfe; and doth not this Condition call for helpe? O let us pitty The Father of our Country, and interpose Betweene his fury and his violence. 'Tis Duty, not Rebellion: We'l restore him To's wits againe, and then he'l thank us all, For hindring's making of himselfe away, How would the young mad Greek have hugg'd that servant, Had hindr'd him in's drunken frolick, from Murdering his friend? Elc. Our ABBAS jealousie, Is no lesse wild then. ALEXANDER'S wine, Both perfect madnesse, and the fit once over, He'l see his error, and be sorry too. Mah. Then how shall they appeare lovely in story, Firm in the Kings, the Princes Peoples loves, That like good Angels, sav'd all that was deare 'Mong us, to Gods, to Honour, and the Empire? An Action no lesse glorious then is ATLAS, His bearing up the sinking Globe from ruine. Elc. My Lord, EMANGOLY, is well belov'd, And now enough incens'd to make the head Of the design, 'twill work his reconcilement With the King too. Mah. No, no, my Lord, why should you Thrust from your selfe so fair a fortune? do't, And let me serve you in't: your hand, my head Our Purses, and our friends together, do it. Besides, EMANGOLY is too much disgrac'd, And men will say his hatred to the King, And not his love, or to the Prince, or Empire, Put him in Armes. Elc. They'l say the same of me. Bear you the name, head both the act and Plot. Mah. (I ne'r meant other good [aside. Gelden, but to ride you.) Elc. I shall have honour enough in serving you. Mah. Well Sir, Ile be no courtier with you then, But do what JOVE shall envy, and wish his. You'l hold the second place, Lievtenant General. Elc. Yes. Mah. Then what friends can you oblige to us? Elc. Ile try them all, but MATZED, young BENEFIAN, And Stout MOZENDRA, I promise to my selfe. Mah. Those are sure cards; what banks have you ith'City Will push out freely to a contribution? “These publick works need many private purses. Elc. Some we shall find. Mah. The beautious FLORADELLA Has promis'd largely, her I have ingaged: We shall proceed the merrier for the Ladies. Elc. We'l give them back their gold to buy their silence. Mah. The best way to assure our selves of that, Is to engage them deep enough; we need them To work their friends, and to augment our treasure. “All wars are chargeable, but civil most, “And we that mean the publick good, must not ‘Lie heavie on the people. I intend A guard of horse, my Government of Shiras Will bear it out, thither I have sent SELEUCUS To govern Larr, and raise three Regiments there, Of horse one, two of foote. This Cittadell Is mine and that is all that readily Could give me any trouble; another force Ile pick up here, the Town and Country swarm With casheer'd souldiers, thirsting for employment. Elc. My Lord, what if I levyed in Hircania? Mah. 'Tis fit, call all your friends about you here To cast your strength up, but avoid all listing. “Listing is dangerous in secret Plots, “One paper lost, discovers all; take only The great ones names, and what they promise, trust to. Elc. We can have no resistance suddenly, The first must be by forreiners call'd in, Nor can the King trust to those mercenaries, Nor will the Persian like their comming in. Besides My Lord, our powers may be ready To be with us, ere they can reach the frontiers: How ere they'l hinder the Kings levies there. Mah. Thou art my Oracle of war. Elc. But why May we not seize the King, and cut the fear Of all resistance off? the Princes friends Are ours already, the rest we'l find, or make so. Mah. Of that at our next Councell, mean time work Your friends as I will mine; but above all Provide what money, and what armes you can: “Who has the gold shall never want the man. Elc. Enough. Farewell my Lord, my good Lord Generall. MAHOMET-ALLYBEG. How shall I fall in love with mine own parts, That have so conn'd all cunning mistique Arts! On every side have I set wheeles a going Shall work my purpose with their own undoing. Torches, shall spend themselves to give me light; Stages, for me to climb by to my height. Then down go they then my hot credulous Lord, And then my fine soft wench will I discard. “The Lovers and the Courtiers Master-piece, “And the states-mans, dissimulation is; “High favour and sure friendship to pretend “To him whose Throat he'l cut, to gain his end: “This must he do, will rise, and then its best “To swear most love, when he intends it least. OLYMPA, FLORADELLA, EARINA CLOE. This, and much more we'l do, to let men see That we can help as well as they, to save A sinking State. Flo. And happy are we Madam, In putting obligation on the present And future ages. For this act the Prince, The Princesse, SOFFIE; nay the King shall call us Their Patronesses, that did timely bring An arme to save them from their hasting ruines. Ear. Children unborn, and Priests not yet begotten Shall sing our names upon high festivalls. Oly. And many a happy Pen shall toyle to keep Our memories as fresh when time himselfe Grows old and halts as now our beauties are. Ear. But why, sha'nt we improve the debt, the State Owes us, by injoying offices, and sitting In councell with the men! Flo. Madam y'are happy In that conceit. Indeed we are fram'd by nature With th'same parts o'th mind for th'exercise Of vertue as men be. Ear. And if men boast Such excellencies, it is reason to think Those no lesse excellent of whom they are: Since timerous Doves did never yet hatch Eagles; But men, and beasts, and all the whole creation, Inherit th'minds and spirits of their Parents. Flo. 'Tis no hard task to patern in our sex All excellent things that ever men performed, Not arts excepted nor that active valour That lift so many Demi-gods to heaven. The valiant Amazons are proof enough. Ear. Nor do others fairnesse take away their force. Oly. True vertu's not oblig'd to live with beards Alone, she may chuse the smoother edifice. But the rough part of vertue, skill in armes I am content to let the men ingrosse. I have no mind to lose a breast, to wear A shield the better Yet state offices And to be Counsellors would become us well. Our Witts are sharpest, and we fittest made For Embassies, as having smoothest tongues. Flo. And should our Rhetorick fail, we'l but employ Our lookes to plead, and conquer with our eyes. Oly. Besides, the novelties and varieties We meet ith'state will yeeld us strange delight. Ear. We'l have them both; the Buffe and Fur shall be A new and fashionable dresse, and every Lady appear a PALLAS, with an Ægis Vpon her breast. Flo. This, Madam, and what else Our Cabinet thoughts can dictate to us shall be All in our powers. Ear. Pluralitie of husbands Would be thought on. Flo. Yes, and Seraglio's too For downy, peachy chins: This, and all else If we but ply the work. There's Madam OMAY Is worth the winning, who has interest in her? Oly. There has been long a league between us strong Enough I hope to make her hear reason from me. Far. She has her share too of ambition, that Will work. Flo. Ambition! Madam, what are we Without it? 'tis necessary as beauty To a great Lady. Ear. What sounds high in others, And is pride, is but needfull state in us, And the true knowledge of our selves. Flo. She's rich, And young and handsome, and you say ambitious; Then She's well qualified. Ear. Handsome, in troth At first she presents well, but then she loses Her selfe presently. Flo. She does indeed—what now. Clo. Madam, my Lord. [in secret Oly. Well, Madam, your great friend Expects you. Flo. No. Oly. Come, come, deny him, do. Ear. Well, we all know our parts, and will not loiter Flo. The pains will pay it selfe.—Now where's my Lord? MAHOMET-ALLYBEG, FLORADELLA. Here, where he would be, Dearest, in thy armes, The Centre my soul tends to. Flo. Welcome, ah Welcome hither, as conquest to the souldier. Mah. How do the Ladies take thy proposition? Flo. as their best wishes. Mah. Good, good ELCHEE too Has swallow'd the hook, and promis'd his Allies. I feel the Crown warm on my head already. My guard is rais'd, I want but the Kings license For their attendance; for that plead thou strongly, Possesse him with the need of't for my safetie, This last service having pul'd envie on me. Flo. It shall be granted, or I'le lowre the dotard To death, it shall, I'le kisse it out of him. Mah. My better Angell! ah! how poor am I That there are not more worlds then one, that I Might cast their crownes into thy lap for this! Flo. Your love my Lord shall set me higher, then if I rode with HECATE in her ebon Charriot, Or held the reins of JUNO's yoaked Peacocks To hold that heart is above all dominion. FLORADELLA, CLOE. How stately a thing it is to be a Queen! O that I now could but look into Heaven, To see how our great sister IUNO shakes Her Scepter ore the world, and learn her carriage! We now must speak ith'plurall number CLOE, Dost thou not see new Majestie spring in us, And all our looks speak Queen? Clo. Madam, I would Fortune had been as free to you as nature Then had that honour long ago rewarded That beauty which did ever merit it. Flo. CLOE, bestow thy wishes on the needy. Fortune has humbled her selfe to us, and Ask'd pardon for so long keeping our right From our possession, a fault she'l now amend, And be our servant ever. Go, provide State Ornaments, and regall Robes for us, Jewells will cost whole Provinces to purchase, And yet receive new lustre from our wearing. Hast any sisters, friends or kinswomen? Prefer them to us, thou shalt have the favour T'appoint our maids of honour, and a set Of servants for us, 'gainst our Coronation.— Dull and insensible! what, didst thou meet Thy Mothers Ghost this morning fasting, that Thou starest so! do not our eyes proclaime it? And all our steps say, they are towards a Throne?— The poverty of thy soule!— Clo. (She's mad, and raves!) [aside. Flo. Have we not taken care for all events That can betide us? Have not we remov'd All that stood stiffe, and many in our way? Goes not the levy's on? flow not friends to us? Is not the Castle ours, and Shiras too? Is not all ours? Or shall be when I've given Th'old Dotard King his pasport in a kisse To th'other world; thither a Dag, or draught, Shall send the Prince, and a Plumb SOFFIE, Who then is Emperour, wench, but MAHOMET His head has laid it, and his hand shall act it, His ready Army shall crush all gain-sayers. Clo. (Perhaps you too.) [aside. Flo. What matter you? me too! Clo. (O how her Plumes would fall now, should I tell her [aside. What I ore-heard!) Flo. What is't you mumble, Gossip? Clo. Madam you'l pardon me, at your last meeting But one, with my Lord MAHOMET, I was curious To listen, and ore-heard some doubtful words, As if he'd onely serve his turn of you. Flo. Pish, pish, He knew you listned, therefore spoke so, If so he spoke, to try my confidence Perhaps, or mock your curiosity. No, well, he knows he never can requite My love with a lesse dowry then the Empire; I have deserv'd it of him, and i'l never Be jealous of his love. Clo. (What toyes doth fancy [aside. Suggest to us, in favour of our selves! Well, I had best comply.)—Indeed perhaps His great wit play'd with me; but could he see me? Flo. Yes, my selfe saw you. Clo. Then 'twas so: but yet Me thought the maner spoke him serious. But sure the Army do's not mean his rule, But to restore the Prince. Flo. Tush, Souldiers know not Their own intents, 'tis as the Generall pleases, Who has an Army up, and a strong Purse May work them easily unto any thing: 'Tis done, 'tis done, my CLOE,—'tis high time For us to practice Queen-ship; thus do we Indulge our hand, our trusty maid of honour. Clo. May't please your Majestie, then must I begin Cloe kisses her hand. To know my selfe, and set a higher price Upon my beauty. Flo. 'Tis indeed a virtue, To prize our selves enough—CLOE, as we passe, Bear up our traine—so—Not so neer our Grace. Clo. High ho! my Heart! I shall have a sweet place. MIRZA, NYMPHADORA, SOFFIE, IFFIDA, PAGE. O the seven Bandogs are let loose againe Upon me! HERCULES! HERCULES! canst not heare! Prethee lend me thy club—the Lubber's sore With's labours still, and sleeps, and hears me not. Nym. Why let you him come out thus? Sof. Alas Madam, He broke through's all, and cals us all his Hangmen. Mir. See! Lightning flashes from their eyes. Sof. Hark, Madam. Mir. Every one of them is a match for CYCLOPS, Yet will I charge them all alone.—O—O. Nym. O. Iff. Help! help! Sof. Page, hold him from violence. Mir. Th'hast hit me right TYPHÆUS, thou hast Centaure. He runs his head against a Post, and falls. The Princess turns away astonished, and weeps, the rest fall down about him. Nym. O heavens! if there be any powers that pitty The miseries of their Creatures, look down on him; The sight's enough to move a heavenly nature. Mir. So MIMAS, hold PORPHYRIO, strike no more, I am TYPHÆUS Prisoner. Nym. Lay not hands Upon him, keep him but from farther hurt. Mir. CHARON! oh, CHARON!— Pag. Nay my Lord. Mir. Come CHARON, Quick, sirrah, Sculler, row me to Elyzium. Nym. Alas! the frenzies high talk not much to him. Mir. But now ha'nt I a halfe-penny for the waftage, No matter though, I'l snatch the slaves Oare from him, And if he grumbles, knock his brains out with it, And CERBERUS his too, if the Cur snarls at me— So—I am pas't without a Sop—now which Of all my friends shall I first meet? Nym. O Gods! Give me more ease, or else more punishment, For I with this can neither die nor live. Mir. Who's that?—That's PROSERPINE bewailing of Her Rape, the silly wench would faine be with Her Mother again. Nym. O make me either happy Again, or wretched till you can no more! Mir. 'Tis so, tis she—she's warm, and soft as air. Takes her hand. Sweet PROSERPINE. Sof. Madam, apply your selfe A little to his passion. Mir. Beauteous Queen O'th'under world, do'nt men when they come hither, Though blind above, have here their eyes restor'd? Nym. Alas! I cannot flatter his wild frenzy. Sof. Pray Madam seem to be what he conceits you. Mir. What art thou, GANYMED? and if thou bee'st, Good yellow-tressed Boy, intreat thy Master, When next he thunders, to bestow a bolt On ABBAS head, 'twill not be cast away, The man deserves it;—but that plague's too quick, Desire him rather, send him PHINEUS, Harpyes, He merits them as much as the Arcadian, He've put out his Sons eyes too: hear'st small skinker? Sof. Yes, and when next I wait, I'l do the errand. Iff. He wants no Furies, he has all in's breast. Mir. Hah art thou a Furie? good TISIPHONE Get thee to Persia then, and take thy sister ERINNYS with thee and torment the Tyrant. Iff. Well sir, he shall not want for torments. Mir. Hark yet, Prethee new wire thy whip before thou goest, And tie more knots on't, take fresh Snakes too with thee; He is my Father, I'd have him want nothing. May all the Scorpions of Cushan sting thee. Nym. Ah! cruell Father! Mir. First TISIPHONE, Lead me to TANTALUS, I'd faine talk with him. Iff. Why TANTALUS? Mir. 'Cause he kill'd his Son too, I'd see if's punishment be great enough, Then I'l Petition PLUTO, my hard Father, May have the same. Nym. O that the Comparison Held whole in thee! He murdered his PELOPS, To entertaine the Gods but ABBAS thee To feast the furies of his frantick mind: To PELOPS too, the yellow Goddesse gave, A whiter shoulder for his own she tasted, And with new better life requited him. O that some Deity would thine eyes restore, Or close up mine! Mir. Hah! that's PROSERPINA, She's in love with me, and condoles me too, But I'l not wrong my NYMPHADORA, though PROSERPINA, where's my Uncle, and my Grandsire Two Persian Princes, murdered by their Son, And brother? I'd faine speak with them, and sit Comparing fortunes with them. Nym. O they are Bathing themselves in blisse, in their sweet Grove. Mir. And shall I be there too, CERES bright daughter? Let me sweet Empresse. Nym. Yes, if you will rest Your head here in my lap, and there lie still. Mir. But will not PLUTO then be jealous of me? Nym. No. Mir. Come then—Now tell me more of Paradise. Nym. There 'midst the fragrant flowre-enammell'd fields, Do golden Pallaces their shining heads Erect, with richest Arras each one floor'd, Christalline Rivers flow to moat them round, For state, not strength, and with their wanton murmurs, Lull every sence, and make soft sleep yet softer; Their banks are fring'd with Trees of Gold, that feast With goodly forms the eye, with fruits the tast; Fruits that pluck't ne'r so oft, straight spring againe, So the rich boughs still with like mettall shine, Under whose fragrant shades they spend their course Of happy time with amorous Virgins, who Regard alone their own particular loves, Not such as tyred out in the world a life, But there created for it, with best form, Cows eyes, and beauteous as the Hyacinth! Still their Virginities return, and still Their beauties flourish as their Paradise, For ever young, yet ripe and fresh; full blown, Yet alwaies free from naturall pollutions, Still as in their third lustre, men ith'fixt. Their Boyes of divine feature minister To them, and proffer hourly to their choices, The most delicious Viands, Drinks, and Voyces. Mir. But when, but when, dear Queene of darknesse, shall I Inherit all this bliss? Nym. When thou art fit for't. Mir. And how shall I make my selfe fit? Nym. By sleep. Sleep will much purge thee from thy earthy humours. Mir. Sweet PROSERPINE, there is in Persia, The fairest Lady that ere blest the Earth, Sweet NYMPHADORA, thou must needs have heard Of her, many worthy Hero's have Dyed for her love; one frown (if such a face Can frown) of hers, have given a hundred Princes Their Pasport hither: didst nere heare them sit And sigh her name? or see't carv'd in the rind Of some faire Tree? Nym. Yes. O that love should last Longer then reason! Mir. She PROSERPINA, Will be with you ere long the noble heart Has taken such a griefe, for her wrong'd MIRZA, It can't last long unbroke, but when she comes, Let not thy PLUTO see her, lest he falls In love with her and so turn thee away, He will PROSERPINA, let him not see her. Nym. Well then,—he sha'nt. Mir. You talk of women too, That we shall have in Paradise; when she comes Let me have her, she was mine own above, And I'le not change her for all natures store. Nym. Admired constancy! sleep, and you shall. Mir. Boy, GANYMED, give me a draught of Lethe To make me sleep,—wilt not?—I'le try without it. Nym. Alas! what noise is that?—Look IFFIDA. [A noise without. Iff. Madam, here comes my Lord EMANGOLY, And three or four with him. Nym. He were welcome, If's comming now could be without disturbance. MIRZA, NYMPHADORA, SOFFIE, EMANGOLY, METHICULI, HYDASPUS, ALKAHEM, IFFIDA, PAGE. Hah! hah! who's that? do's PLUTO come? Nym. No, no, Lie still. Ema. We'd best retire. Nym. No, joyn your help With me to calm his fury. Ema. O that my selfe Had bit my unhappy tongue from th'panting root And spit it in the Tyrants face, which falling Had (trembling) murmur'd curses at hs foot, When I gave counsell to my Lord t'obey His cruell message. Met. O who ever yet Saw the returning steps oth'credulous beasts, That visited the counterfeit sick Lion? Hyd. And yet, O ABBAS, what fierce ravenous Lion Did ever Lybia's fiery womb produce, Or what fell Tyger, thy Hyrcania, Of so prodigious cruelty, as thou art? Alk. Lions are tame as Lambs, and Tygers mild As frisking kids, to that outragious monster. Ema. There is no perilous desart but his breast, Where teeth and armed fangs do tear the strong And treacherous toiles t'insnare the innocent, Are ever ready set. Met. O th'cruelty Of hate, disguis'd like love! Ema. And how, O Gods, Is vertue dear to you, if thus the Serpent Of Treason, be permitted to turn Dove, To flatter it, by unsmelt means to ruine! Mir. I knew on earth a voice like that,—sure 'tis My good EMANGOLY's—and is he here too? Ema. Here, my deer Lord; but O that I had been Under the earth, when my unlucky judgment Advis'd you hither. Sof. O you've spoil'd all my Lord. Mir. Why are we still ith'upper world? I thought I'de past the ford.—Cheats! cheats! and fantasies! [He starts up. Quick then, EMANGOLY, go muster all Our force, and see them paid, I'le march to morrow, And never make a halt till I have kickt Bizantium's selfe to dust. Let an Iron Cage Be made to carry with us, for proud MORAT. I'le try yet if his stomach be as stout As BAJAZET'S; but line it all with furrs, To hinder him from the pleasure of a death. Nym. Would he but cool with sleep his high distemper, All these wild thoughts would vanish with his frenzy. Ema. Repose Sir, till the Army needs your conduct. Nym. Yes, my dear Lord, restore thy selfe again Unto my care, and make my lap thy pillow. Mir. I will, my sweet, and ne'r would rise from hence, Did not dear honour call as loud as thunder, Such is my love to thee, yet could I not Love thee so much, lov'd I not honour more. Nym. IFFIDA call for musick, and a song, Gentle and soft, as Notes of dying Swanns, To woo him into slumbers. Sof. That will charm him. Mir. The Turks already made thy Prisoner, when I next return my selfe to thy soft breast, His head's a present for thee. Nym. Hark! my Lord, [soft musick. How gentle rest courts thee in her best language. SONG. He's great that masters his own soul, As he whose nod shakes either Pole. Not he that Kings in chains can bring, But that subdues himselfe's a King. That's ever in himselfe at home, And ne'r lets his Queen Reason roam, On whom all passions waiting stand, As hand-maids on their Ladies hand. He ore himselfe triumphing first, Dares chance and envy doe their worst; And keeping still his own even height, Fall Fortune heavie, fall she light, He'l never make to th'standers by Too low a moan, or haughty cry; But wisely can her fawning slight, And then as bravely scorn her spight. Who can deny that such a one Possesses all things, or wants none? And which oth'two would you wish first Still to have drink, or ne'r to thirst? Ema. Excellent morality! O the vast extent O'th Kingdome of a wiseman! Such a mind Can sleep secure when th'brine kisses the Moon, And thank the curteous storm for rocking him. Sof. Come my good Lord METHICULI, you and I Will sit, and tell sad stories; pray begin. Nym. Ah me! what storie canst thou hear can vie For sadnesse with our owne? run ore the Roule Of Tragedies, and write but NYMPHADORA And MIRZA (for let's nere be parted more) And that's the sum of all that grief can do. Met. But my Lord SOFFIE, I've a plot to free you. Sof. Speak it, and be my Deitie. Met. And once out, I can secure you, where not all the force The Tyrant, or the world can make shall reach you. Sof. But how shall I get out? Met. Your sister, Sir, Has won much on your grandsires best affections, So that if he love ought that's good, 'tis hers: And she comes often here to pay her duty To her dear Father, (O too much wrong'd Father!) Sof. Nay, pray, no circumstance, she comes, what then? Met. I'd have your grace change cloaths with her, and so You vailed, may easily passe the guards, and come Where I'le receive you. Sof. How shall she get out Again? Met. Sir, 'twill be quickly known to the Tyrant, Who loves her so, he'l not be long without her, He'l send for her, and with a chiding passe it. Sof. But wilt not turn his rage on my dear Mother. He'l not think this plot only FATYMA's And mine, but hers. Nym. I'd suffer for thy good All th'Tyrant now can do, the wasp has stung Me already, and disarm'd himselfe: if rest Restores the Princes senses, we'l advise With him about it—How sweet securitie He now enjoyes! O pleasant dreams! slide softly Into him, that he takes no wounds from you. Present his silent thoughts with purling streams And hushing winds, such as perfume the morn. Then mildly as thou seiz'd him gentle Goddesse, Resign him perfect: so what was the gift Of relenting heaven, we'l ascribe to thee. Mir. Ah! where am I? Iff. He wakes. Nym. Pray heaven to health. Here my deer Lord, In thy sad spouses lap, Yet compass'd with a ring of thy best friends. Mir. That Ring is sorrows Crown,—and can it be That any will be friends to wretchednesse? High mounted in the Courts and Armies head, The Sun had not more Atomes dancing in His beams, then I had followers in mine. But even from him ecclips'd, all shadowes vanish, And shall mine then continue? Nym. These are such As vertue, not your fortune, made your friends, And will though fortune failes, continue such, Since your high vertue cannot ever leave you. Ema. If we lov'd and obey'd you, when you stood In power, both to do us good and honour, Which then we never could requite unto you, We ought to publish now our gratefulnesse, When the world sees no hopes induce us to it. Mir. There gratitude spoke in her Angels voice. Met. We have lost in you a Prince for to defend us, A Father to care for us, a Companion In all our joyes, a Friend in all our wants; And if we owe to your sad memory The pious dutie of our love and honour, Shall we not pay them to your selfe yet living? Mir. Not living, say, but buried alive. Hid. Treasure ith'mind, is treasure still, though trodden. Ema. Should we desert you now, 'twould basely prove We never lov'd your highnesse, but your fortune. Alk. Rather, we never lov'd his Grace, but Highnesse. Ema. Like vermine that suck of the living blood, But leave the body soon as life. Alk. The'more Love We ow'd you, the more should we shew our hate To the accursed Author of our losse. Let's rouze revenge, and arme all her dire hands With Thunder, to discharge upon the Tyrant. Mir. Act, act, brave friends, and leave complaints to women; 'Twill be more honourable for my Tombe To be sprinkled with my murderers blood, Then with the tears of you my constant friends. Nym. Now have I time to shed some, but in private. Iffida follows her out. “They truly mourn, that mourn without a witnesse. MIRZA, SOFFIE, EMANGOLY, METHICULI, HYDASPUS, ALKAHEM, PAGE. O let me not lie long in this sad durance! Met. This justice to the world, This duty to Our injur'd Prince, This honour to our selves, And terror to our foes, do strongly plead for. Alk. This will restore our glories lost, and put A muzzell upon Tyrannies black jawes. Hyd. How shall we effect it? Mir. How? and have not you The Power of the sword, the Souldiery? Ema. Alas! not we, my Lord, we're all casheer'd. Your highnesse was no sooner cheated from us, And decoy'd up to Court, to be undone, But BELTAZAR comes down strong in commission, To be my Collegue, that is, my superior. We vexed at our injuries, and losse Of you, threw up all diligence, and quitted Counsell or action, when the minion shew'd Power to clap a peace up, which was quickly Done, on conditions fit for slaves, not souldiers; The Army all disbanded, I call'd up, Met with Arrest and banishment from Court. Thus is their wrong secur'd by our weaknesse. Mir. Shall we then tamely suffer? my blind self Will grope out Vengeance yet, and in deep makes Incize it on the Tyrants own dull head. Ema. O foolishnesse of Tyranny! that the King Should arm his foes, and thirst his own undoing! He studies evill, and seems lost to all goodnesse, But for his love to your sweet FATYMA. Mir. And loves he her? can vice then affect vertue? Ema. Sir, her he doth embrace with all the powers Of a doting soul. Hyd. Has her still in his eye, Nor ere seems pleas'd with ought but what she does. Alk. He talks of marrying her to th'King of Arabs. Mir. Soft, I've a better match for her in store. Ema. We met his Proclamation as we came Stuft with invectives 'gainst your Grace and us Your Highnesse grew too great, wee too much lov'd you, Therefore the King must fear, yea, and remove you. My treachery to the English it alledg's That help't me to take Ormus, when 'tis known Themselves first broke conditions, and enjoy Still Priviledges for their service there. This is the Costermonger ALLY-REG, For his smooth tongue must the old King go mad And doat upon his foes, when there is never A Jewell in's Crown but is enamell'd Both with your Highnesses brave blood and mine. Mir. I that so oft displai'd his bloody colours I'th'martiall field, and bearded his proud foes, I that have so inlarg'd his Territories, And stretch't his line beyond the Caspian Sea, Driven the Mogul into his Candahor, To stand and see me wast his other lands. Made Balsora th'Arabians utmost bound, And bounded th'Tartar with th'Hyrcanian Ocean. I that check't CYCALA'S insulting Progresse, Torturing th'Georgians, our Confederates With eighty thousand men, I that first chased His bulkie Army to th'Armenian bounds, Then forc't him fight, and gave my selfe the pleasure To paddle ith'blood of thirty thousand Turkes: I that did still pursue that flying General Into Iberia, and slaughter'd all The Turkish Garrisons in Teflis, Tauris, Cazbeen and Babylon that year regaining No lesse from ACHMAT to ungratefull ABBAS Then our TAMAS lost to their SOLYMAN. I that since that, beat that stout CYCALA Oft as he could recruit, till the Foe vow'd Never to follow more that lucklesse Chieftain, Must now be th'Martyr of the Insolence Of slaves, and a besotted Tyrants wrath. Ema. I that gave Ormus scepter to his hand, And brought her Captive King to live upon His slender Pension of five Markes a day. I that subdued Larrs sandy Kingdom for him, Maugre her wall of Rock, am now accused By him for killing her King treacherously, When he himself angry I gave him quarter Commanded it: I now must tire out My life in exile, or, as bad, disgrace. Met. And I that won the Realm of Larry Joon Am taxt with a perfidious. Victory, When I had died, had I return'd without it. Ema. Why murmur subjects when his Son escapes not Mir. And how could I hope other, when his Nature Thirsts after blood as food! O when so many Innocent subjects fell, they warned me. What signified his wrong to the poor Christians, His murdering of his Embassadour To th'Turk as he'd kill all can't work his ends. Met. His Treachery to the Magician, set him On work, then hang him up for conjuring. Ema. His murder of the sleeping Traveller, Because his pamper'd horse but startled at him. Hyd. His coupling of the souldiers lustful wife To an Asinego. Alk. His cutting a Clerks hand off But for not writing fair. His wrath to th'two Pilfering Souldiers, more for their raggs then theft. Met. But above all, his ore-ambitious murder Of his brave Father, and far braver Brother. Mir. His Torture, Poysons, strangling with bowstrings; Men eating Doggs, and Arts of Tyranny Proclaim his nature, that it must be glutted With blood, and why not ours, since 'tis best? Met. What better promises his irreligion, In taking needlesse Journeies still in Lent T'avoid fasting, under pretence of Travell? Ema. Our misery is his inconstancy Like the weather about the Equinoctial, Now a quiet breath, and gentle gale, and then A storm so fierce, a ship can feel no helm? Thus he'l forbid and tolerate the same thing Oft in one year, not as his interest, But as his variable humour swaies him. Mir. Go my EMANGOLY, take my bank at Ormus, Rally with it a Troop of your old Souldiers, And give me liberty: take my SOFFIE Into your care, and make him safe in private. Sof. Sir, here's a way propounded for my freedom, To change cloaths with my Sister FATYMA, And go like her out hence. Mir. Let it be done. Be ready to receive him, and be to him As much a Father as thou 'hast friend to me. Ema. So Heaven be mine, as I his faithfull friend. Mir. 'Tis no small benefit that this rough fortune Discovers yet my friends, severs the doubtfull From the assur'd, for Prosperity At her departure took away with her Those that were her's, and left me still mine own. O at how vast a rate would I have bought This fair discovery before my fall! And when I thought my self most fortunate! If Heaven again will my lost state restore And wealth, i'le use them better then before! If not, my soul not at the losse repines, Having found friends, a greater wealth then Mines. VASCO, CLOE. Lady, but that no fault or disrespect In me to your sweet Beauties merit it, I should afflict my self to see your Countenance Estranged thus to your best servant. Clo. Sir, I know no fault, nor is my countenance chang'd But with my state, due gravitie increas'd. Vas. As how, dear Lady, since I left the Court Is our state chang'd? I hope the cloud upon My Lord shall not obscure me? Clo. No, but you Think then I am the same you left me? Vas. Yes Lady, I see no change, your lip, your eye Has the same lustre, the same tincture on't. If there be any change, 'tis for the better. Clo. Better, I know that marry; yes my hopes, Nay certainties, are higher then before. And shall my thoughts then bear no correspondence? Is it no more to be chief Maid of Honour To the Empresse of Persia, then woman to My Lady FLORADELLA? Vas. (Sure she's mad!) Empresse! we have none. Clo. But we shall have soon. Follow me in, and I'le unriddle to you. Since we are one, the secret is safe still, And were the fortune mine, it should be yours. Vas. Love and amazement! what will this produce? ABBAS, FATTYMA, FARRABAN. 'Tis granted, pretty heart, they all shall have Their just desires, and I truly wish I could as safely give them liberty As necessaries in their just restraint. FARRABAN, see your royall Prisoners have What they desire, fit for their condition. Wait my fair granchild to them. Fat. Sir, my thanks. Come FARRABAN. Far. Madam, your humble Servant. ABBAS. O strength of vertue! how dost thou shine forth In this sweet Innocent! how dutifull, How carefull, how solicitous is she For her Parents! and shall not nature then As well descend, as ascend? am not I As well his father, as she his daughter? but Here's she will turn these thoughts another way. FLORADELLA. [to him Intrude not I upon your privacies? Abb. No, my best love, for what is more important Then thy embrace? and what affair shall not Vanish at thy approach, as mists at daies? But I see businesse in thy face; come speak it. Flo. Though hither chiefly, love and duty brought me, Which puts me strongly forward to your pleasure, I have indeed somewhat to ask your Grace, 'Tis for your servant MAHOMET, his last service Has render'd him most odious and envy'd. The factious threaten in private, and in publick Beard him to's face. Abb. There's lightning in his eyes Shall blast all his maligners. Flo. They are great, Strong, and increast much by th'cast Officers, Most now in Town, all of the Princes faction, So that without a guard he can't with safetie Attend your person, or follow your affairs Which ask his publick presence: and you know How much your service needs him. Abb. He shall have part of our guards assign'd him. Flo. (Those can't we Trust) that your state permits not—see himselfe. [aside. ABBAS, MAHOMET-ALLYBEG, FLORADELLA. Come MAHOMET, what need hadst thou t'employ Any tongue but thine own in thy just suit? Thou maist do more with me, my MAHOMET, raise For thy securitie, what guards thou pleasest. Mah. I willingly could have spar'd this needlesse state, Could I securely attend your service: But though arm'd with my innocence, I fear not JOVES Thunder-bolts yet, “Wise prevention “Is the first point of wisdome in a Peer. Sir, here is a commission, please you hear It read, and sign it? Abb. Give me it, MAHOMET, We'l sign it without reading, we dare trust thee, Farther then this. Flo. Your Highnesse may. Abb. We know it. Flo. Dear, thou knowest when to meet at Madam OMAY's [They whisper. The consultation's there, you had the watchword? Mah. I know the time, and will not loiter, deerest, Since 'tis for thee I work. Flo. And I for thee. Abb. A Masque attends me, thou shalt sweet partake it: Thou MAHOMET hast something else to do. MAHOMET-ALLYBEG. Yes, I have that to do, shall undo you, I erre, 'tis done not Heaven can hinder it. But should th'whole Machine oth'design crack, which Would more amaze the world then brutish thunder, The pleasure I have given my selfe to see To what a height I've wound this strumpets soul, Would almost pay my pains: How sure she makes Her selfe, of what I never mean her fortune! Then when I rise fresh in my summer glory, And throw her off, like a course robe I wore, Only to shield me from my colder winter. Who will not say, I cunnings Master am, That can deceive, and that in their own game, Greatest deceivers when they me shall know Out-cheat a woman, and a strumpet too. VASCO. Am I awake! or do I live! what torrent Of evills have over spread thee Persia? Is justice cripled? and the furies all Let loose to act their Gambols in the world? Dire secret of the direct Treason! how It swells within me till I be delivered Of it at my Lords ear! He happily May stop its course: then was my love well plac't To sift out this; and though I die this night, I've liv'd to be most happy, and the ages To come shall pay thanks to my memory. MIRZA. [on his Couch alone. Blinded! imprison'd! pining here for want Of what each debaucht Ruffian spends in riot! And by command of my own Tyrant Father! A proper Patrimony! If the Turk Had us'd me thus, my fall had been with honour, And heart held up with hope, whilst I had had A Father to command Revenge, and friends To act it home: But when those friends are thus Fetter'd, disgrac'd, and torn from my assistance, And nature too turn'd backward in my Father, What have I left me, but to curse my starrs? Starrs! ignes fatu! glittering Meteors! That made a show of greatnesse, and in snuff Now loose their glimmering false light, and stink! Unnaturall Monster! have I left so oft For thee, and for thy safety, the embrace Of my fair Princely spouse? abandoned My self to all the sufferings and hazzards Of bitter and long war, to have this Triumph? O that I could relieve my soul with vengeance! In my last sleep I saw the wandring Ghosts Of my great Uncle, and wrong'd Grandfather Squallid and pale, attended with an Army Of murder'd spirits, all my Fathers crimes, Calling loud to me for revenge, revenge, Both for the love I bear them, and my self. I'th'head of these gnashing her teeth with ire Came frowning NEMESIS, offering a whip Of folded snakes to my impartiall hand. My soule's now like a boistrous working Sea Swelling in billows for disdain of wrongs, And tumbling to and fro from Bay to Bay, Nothing can calm it but full wrought Revenge. Stern Goddesse! I adore, and give my self To thy dispose. O point me but a way To work thy ends and mine! My arm is short And shackled thus with Irons, I can't reach The Tyrants heart, how shall I serve thee then When strait she calls to me with bended brows, Reach him in's Favourites: 'las! ALLYBEG Is strong ith'Courts and Tyrants affections, But he has Marble walls, and Iron barrs T'ween him, and me. But FATYMA comes to thee, She saies: and she's the Idoll of his soul, Rob him of her. Shall I through my own sides Wound him? and to deprive him of a Grandchild, Tear from my self a daughter, no lesse dear And dutifull to me, then she's to him? But I am great with child of indignation And cannot be delivered but by vengeance, And no revenge but this is in my reach. I shall but send her to the pleasant Groves, Give her at once Heaven and the Tyrant Hel, Hell in his thoughts, Hell in his Conscience, And that same Hell of his is Heaven to me. It is decreed: She dies to make him do so. O sweet revenge! how I thirst now for blood, And burn more then I lately did for drink, In my wild feaver hottest fit?—who waits there? SOFFIE, MIRZA, NYMPHADORA, IFFIDA. Call'd you my Lord? Mir. Yes child, is FATYMA come Sof. Not yet Sir, Mir. SOFFIE, art thou prepar'd For freedom when she comes. Sof. Sir, as you please. Mir. yes, thou shalt go to Libertie, though I Repent thy absence.—O, my great resolve! [in secret. If I must fall, I'l pul down Persia with me, And have no lesser Monument then an Empire. Nym. And when th'art free, and in EMANGOLY'S care Think oth'restraint thy Parents here endure, And seek with all discreet care to redresse it. Sof. I shall not rest till then. Iff. Here's FATYMA. MIRZA, NYMPHADORA, SOFFIE, FATIMA, IFFIDA. Come child. Fa. Fate is not yet all cruelty. Nym. What's this I see child in thy face of mirth? Fat. Madam, I have got Licence of the King For all you can desire but Liberty. Mir. And without that what can we here desire Worth satisfying?—Come hither FATYMA, Stand here between my knees.—(Sweet innocent! [in secret. Ah! that I could but now forget all Father, Or else be like mine own, and leave all goodnesse!) Sweet child, art thou contented to stay here, And let thy Brother 'scape in thy attire? Fat. Most willing Sir. Nym. Thy Grandsire will not let Thee lie here long in misery like us. Fat. Would I might still stay here to wait on you, I'd rather so.—My Lord METHICULI Is at the Castle gate waiting for some body. Sof. That is for me. Fat. Come Brother let's change cloaths. Mir. Stay FATYMA, suppose thy Grandfather, Why say I so? thy Fathers Murderer, Should now grow angry with thee for this change, How wilt thou bear his wrath? child, canst thou die? Fat. Yes Sir, if you will have me; to die and sleep They say is one, and after Death we wake In a fresh Paradise where joyes abound. Mir. All joyes are there, there once, for all the world Thou wouldst not be a minute here again. Fat. But Sir, shall I not want your Presence there? And my dear Mothers? and my Princely Brothers? I love you better then all joyes beside. Mir. Pretty ignorance! thou goest but before, Wee soon will follow thee. In the mean time, There shalt thou meet thy Uncle and great Grandsire, They will make much of thee, and shew thee all The glories there, the green and fragrant fields, Ripe fruits that ne'r decay. Soft melting songs And Carolls of the Golden-feather'd birds Shall lull thee asleep: then shalt thou wake agen To see the Nymphs and Virgins dance about The silver Rivers, they shall take thee in, And make thee Mistris of their sprightly Revells. Fat. Would I were there, if you would follow, but I'l not be there without your company. Mir. I'l follow thee sweet heart, when I have got Revenge enough upon the doting Tyrant: Mean while—(O NEMESIS! see! I obey thee! [in secret. Act thou my shaking hands, and be my Goddesse!) Go thou before me, and prepare my way.— Iff. O Heavens! Sof. O Gods! what fury's this! He takes Fatyma by the neck, breakes it, and swings her about. The Princesse Soffie and Iffida in vain hang about him to save the child. Nym. My Lord, my Lord, 'tis FATYMA you kill. Mir. I therefore kill her because FATYMA. She could not die more innocent, nor I Get better vengeance on the Tyrants head Lie thee there till another comes.— Fat. O—O— He throws her down. She dies. Nym. Ah me! sweet babe! is all the world turn'd Monster? Sof. Ah! my dear Sister! Mir. SOFFIE, come hither, No?— Nym. Fly dear SOFFIE. Iff. Fly, fly, my Lord. Mir. Come hither or be wretched. The Princesse and Iffida fall a chafing of Fatyma, till seeing the Prince groap after Soffie too, they rise, &amp; hold him, till Soffie escape. Nym. O my Lord, Why will you wrong your vertue thus to murder These pieces of your selfe? Mir. Because the Tyrant Loves them and lov'd he me I'd kill my self too, But since he doth not, I will live to spight him. The 'worlds too little to satiate my revenge. Sof. Page! Guard! ope, ope, O ope the doors and save me, FARRABAN, PAGE. Guard. [To them. Rundown, sir, run that way.—Horror and Furies! [To Soffie. Mir. Take you all.—dogs! wher's SOFFIE? Far. Escap'd From your wild rage. Mir. My curse shall overtake him. Far. We'd best bind him. Pag. Hold, gently, gently, sir. Nym. Ah! the sweet soul is fled, fled, never, never, She chafes Fatyma again. O never to return. Iff. Ah. sweetest Mistris! Mir. Then carry her to my Father as my Present, 'Twil make my peace with him, he'l love me now For doing this Act, 'tis so like his own. Far. 'Twill make all good men— Pag. Pray sir speak not to him. Mir. Look down, look down great Uncles Ghost, and see Where ABBAS Jewell lies! the sight will give thee A riper joy then thou dist feele, when thy Dread hand struck off CARAEMIT's proud head. 'Tis I that must revenge my self and you. Come Page, attend me to my Dungeon, There will I boast my parcell Vengeance, And study more, and ruine th'whole Creation But I will make the Tyrant hang himself. Far. Good Heavens! how rage Beats men out of themselves! Nym. Bring in the precious body IFFIDA, I cannot yet bewail her fate nor mine, Too great for words is my vast misery: “Small Griefes make men lament, Great stupify. SOFFIE, METHICULI. O my good good Lord! the saddest accident! My Father has kill'd with his own hands my Sister, The Castle is all in an uproar at it, In which I escap'd, else he had kill'd me too. Met. Thank Heaven you have so—come my Lord, this is No place for talk, quick, let us hast away. Sof. Fast as you please my honour'd Lord, &amp; whither EMANGOLY, VASCO. He muffles Soffi in his Cloak, and carries him away What horrours seize me! that the world should thus Be all abandon'd to the furies envy! Sure this is but to cheat us! Vas. No my Lord, Though CLOE told it with such confidence, The horror was not able to perswade me, Till first I ran to OMAY'S Garden House; There the Conspirators are all to meet, The house preparing and the entertainment. Ema. Dire discoveries! VASCO, this you'l swear, And with your blood maintain? Vas. I will sir. Ema. Come then, Though banished, I'l venture to the King, And break his hasty order for his good. How happy art thou to discover this? Thou shalt be Persia's Genius, she shall pay Devotions to thee: and how blest am I To be an instrument to save my Country! O Heaven! how bounteous art thou to mankind! When we rush on to ruine, mad, and blind, Thou cast's a bit upon our furious hast, To curb us for our good, and from our wast Preserve us 'gainst our wills! Whence is it, whence That the world stands but from thy providence, Truth-loving JOVE? Thou wilt not suffer wrong, However great, to go unpunisht long; Or although long to us, and to sense past All hope, yet full-paid vengeance comes at last. “Thy certain Justice ever ready stands, “And though she 'has leaden feet, she 'has Iron hands. CHORUS. A passion stronger then the rest No more call love, Since dire revenge in a wrong'd breast More strong doth prove. She breaks all bands for her desire, Blood is her food, She treads down all things in her ire, Though just or good. Ore love it selfe she triumpht hath, Oft having forc't Fierce hands in the dear bloud to bath Which they lov'd most. The fierce Oarysian Queen to take Revenge upon Her husband, for her sisters sake, Butcher'd her son As to the wood a Tygresse wild A Fawn doth trail: She drag'd to a close room the child. Where nought avail His tears, his banishments, or both To calm her blood, Revenge stood by gnashing her teeth, Expecting food. O rage of women! though the boy T'her bosom clung, She him (nor turn'd her face away) Stab'd as he hung. He kis't, she stab'd O dire reward His kisses got! The pavements blusht with blood besmear'd Though she did not. This proves not she her sister priz'd Before her Boy, But that all are by rage despis'd For cruell joy. And that revenge might ore men too Her Triumphs see, We have a Father late did doe As much as she. A Father, by his held in thrall, His daughter kill'd 'Cause her the Grandsire above all Things precious held. Since his revenge could reach no more O rages sway! The Jewell of this soul he tore From him away: Carelesse, so him, himself to strike, Hope flatter'd so, What that to PROGNE's, this the like T'his Sire would doe. Go innocent Princesse Martyr go Of Rage and Fate, And in thy checker'd Grove below, Embrace thy Mate. ITYS and FATYMA there shall cling Into a pair, Him sweetest birds shall ever sing, And MUSES her. Impute not thou the crime, O JOVE, And breach of Lawes To th'Actor, but to them that gave The cruell cause.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. V. FATYMA's Funerall passes over the Stage; Six Virgins bearers. ABBAS, MAHOMET ALLY-BEG, BELTAZAR, FLORADELLA, OLYMPA, EARINA, &amp;c. Chief Mourners. A Funerall ELEGIE, sung to the Harp. Grief and Horror seize on all, From the Suns rise to his fall. But in in sighs no breath be spent, No voice heard but to lament, In each face the cause is read, FATYMA and Beauty's dead. SOL, disturb not sorrows night She gone, none deserves thy light. And ther's none now whose eye may Bright as hers did gild thy Ray. Birds, that did your songs forbear, Hers with more delight to hear, And did still expecting stand Notes from her voice, meat her hand, You again may sing alone, You'l be heard now she is gone. To her name your voices set, And ne'r sing a note but that. Flowers, droop your leaves and wither, You no more her hand shall gather. Wither, wither, for there's none Worth a Garland, she being gone. Water Nymphs, that in a maze Oft have stopt your sports to gaze At her sitting on your banks, Or else tripping ore their cranks, In a Dance, with odorous feet, And a grace as VENUS sweet, Weep her losse: weep, more you'l ne'r See your selves out-done by her. Weep till you thaw: melting, mourn, Till into your streams you turn. Winds, let sighs henceforth consume yee, Her breath shall no more perfume yee. Be astonish'd thou O Earth, Thou hast lost thy fairest birth. See! see! all the charm obey! Into night is shrunk the day. The Sun mourns, or, to judge right He wants her to give him light. Birds have learnt her name, and now Hark! they sing't on every bough. Of the flowers some decay, Others wither quite away, Or if any beauty have Still, they keep it for her grave. Grief has turn'd the Primrose pale, Lillies droop, and all bewail: Down the Violet hangs her head, All the Roses tears have shed; Cups full have each Daffadil: Down along the cheeks they trill Of the rest, and trembling there Hang, true Pearles for sorrows wear. Fountains weep, winds sigh her fall: Earth is stupified withall. Onely Gods from grief refrain, Since earths losse is Heavens gain. For since she arriv'd at Heaven Now the Graces number's even. Abb. No more let bold Philosophers denie That Vertues are from Nature since here lies An heap of Beauties, with more graces born Then Education or Art ere gave The longest liver. Once a divine soul Inform'd that curious Body, and so acted It to all good, that Heaven envied Earth Th'enjoyment of it, therefore took it home As bright as when she lent it the fair modell, And now it shines the brightest star she has. But why, so soon, good Heaven, hast dispossess'd Earth of her glory? Is' because you mean To call the Chaos back again, and she The soul oth'world must first be tane away? Day must depart before foul night can come? Or fail'd your Power? could you not make the summer And Autumn of her Age as glorious As her sweet Spring, and so destroy'd it quite? Or doubted you she would engrosse all hearts, All loves? and make us think there was no Heaven, No Paradise but her, and her sweet favour, So, jealous of your Honour, took her hence? No, but now that her viper Father had Given up his name to mischief and Rebellion, That all that's good of him might fall, she must: And fall his crime: but O that crime alone Had he no more, should sink his monstrous head Below the deepest Hell, I punish him Not now for crimes committed against me, But 'gainst himself; these I could have forgiven, And Nature almost now had won me to it, But this dire murder of my joy and comfort, Has chas't away all pitty from my thoughts, And arm'd my heart and hand with torments for him. Who will not crush the worme that eats his Rose? Goe FARRABAN, lade the inhumane Monster With pondrous chains as heavy as his guilt: Remove all comforts from him: pine his carkasse, Till his own flesh be his abhorred food, He may as well devour that as this; O Tell him we'l study Torments for him, Torments Witty and requisite, as he wishes us. Deliver th'message to him in words, fit For a just anger, great as ours is 'Twill be some comfort to this innocents soul To see her murderers blood poured upon Her divine ashes: Pardon, glorious Ghost, (For now devotion's due to thy bright lustre) That we mix with thy sacred dust a blood So tainted: yet 'tis but thy sacrifice.— You FARRABAN, see SOFFIE be regain'd Again, you'd best: I wonder at your neglect Of care to guard so great Prisoner. Far. My Liege, I'th uproar when the guards were all Employ'd to stop the Princes frantick rage, He made escape. Abb. Well, see he be sought out.— Lead on, and enrich Earth with Heavens envy. MIRZA, PAGE. Great NEMESIS! now have I sacrific'd To thee the best of Creatures Persia had; If the old Tyrant feeleth but the wound, I have mine ends, and thou a feast of blood. Pag. But sir, I fear the blow you gave through her Will fall most heavy on your self: and make Him more incens'd. Mir. So he but feels a grief, I'l triumph in my pains, and scorn his worst. MIRZA, PAGE, FARRABAN. Who's that? Pag. 'Tis FARRABAN, and in his looks I see Revenge and Torments threatned. Mir. Tut! Far. Sir, the King – Mir. Peace, thou most impudent tongue, Call him not King, but dotard Tyrant, Serpent, Go on. Far. Commands me to deliver's wrath To you in thunder: Pardon the messenger, He threats you with Strapadoes, Famine, Tortures Cunning and cruell, for your dire deed. Mir. I thank his Tyrantship; return thou him From me many curses: but how took he His minions death? Far. As he would do the sight Of his own Executioner, heavily. His life-blood seem'd to stream from's aged eyes, Horror to seize his Limbs, and grief his soul. He tore his silver hair, beat's reverend breast, Threw himself prostrate on the loved body, And curs'd his starrs: the killing newes is like To do as much for him, as for the old PANDION the like act of PROGNE's did. He slights his meat, seems wholly given over To sorrow and revenge. Mir. Io, Io, PÆAN! Sing victory, sing victory, my soul, I'm Conquerour: I've vanquish't the stern Tyrant In a great deed, 'bove th'horror of his own. Now I can make him grieve, I'le make him bleed, Bleed next, dog Goaler, bleed his damned soul To air, which will turn to Pestilence, And poyson, and infect the cursed world. He has but yet a tast of what i'l do. Far. Sir, sir, we'l keep you from all further outrage. Pag. Be civill, villain, to your Royal Master. Far. He must excuse me, I'm but an Officer. Mir. O'th Devills.—Traytor, do thy drudgery. Far. He has commanded me to load your limbs With weighty gyves, and famish your stout stomach Pag. The Devill has. Mir. His gyves are ornaments To me: and Famine, that I fear not slave, I'l feed on my revenge. Come bring thy fetters, I will adore them as a lover does His Ladies favours. Pag. Sir, Exasperate Not Tyranny. Mir. Sweet youth, be patient, I'l teach thee courage. Hangman come, your chaines, I'le follow you by your sent. Beare-ward, to have them. EMANGOLY, HYDASPUS, VASCO, Horror! that the brave Prince should ever do So cruell a deed! but what can't sense of wrongs And thirst of revenge force a great mind to! Yet shall this stop our grand design no longer. Now for the King. HYDASPUS, you say SOFFIE Is at METHICULI's Farme, without the Town?— What is't you study of? Hyd. My Lord?—yes, yes, He is,—My Lord, I was even stricken dumb With the discoveries you've made. Ema. O great, and Horrid they are: by this the hellish Counsell Is upon meeting; sure their hour's near? Vas. 'Tis come my Lord. Ema. Come then HYDASPUS you'l Accompany me to th'King. Hyd. You know, my Lord, We are forbidden. Ema. What then? for his good, And to save Persia, what is our lives hazard? Hyd. They can't be better spent, i'l wait your Grace. Ema. But not a word where SOFFIE is as yet. ABBAS, PAGE. Fatyma murder'd! all my joyes are fled! Fled in a moment! Pageant of Earths greatnesse! I that was erst ador'd, great in an Army, Strong in a valiant Son, and happy in The fair hopes of two brave Grandchildren, Am now forlorne in all: my Army broken, A base peace made for which all brave men loath me, One of my Grandchildren, hope of my Crown, Fled, but O whither? that's unknown to me, The other dead, dead, and worse, murdered By her own Father, ah unnaturall Father! But yet not more unnaturall then my self, Us'd I not him so? and should he not be As dear to me as she to him? I did, I did, O mischief of credulity! And causelesse jealousie! would all my fears Had happened, so I were guiltlesse still. It then had been his fault, not mine. O heart! Pag. May't please you, sir, my Lords, EMANGOLY And HYDASPUS do strongly plead without For Audience of your Majestie, shall they enter? Abb. Have I not banish'd them my Presence? well, They die for breach of the command, if they Prove not their innocence: Let them enter, i'l Have now an ear for both parts; I will never Punish more on bare hearsay,—Guard, attend us. ABBAS, EMANGOLY, HYDASPUS, GUARD. How dare you thus intrude into my presence? Must I forbid you, and my strict commands Be slighted thus? you rush upon your ruine. Ema. Sir, were we conscious to our selves of any The least neglect unto your just commands, We'd fly your sight as doth the Owl the Suns, And seek out corners for our Treasons safety, But when we dare defie black Calumny, We know not why we should not venture to you To warn you of your safety, now at stake. Abb. At stake! as how? Hyd. If there be any fault In us, examine it in fitter time, And spare it not, but study punnishments New and exemplary to plague us with, At least, at present, mind to save your Crown, Your Realms, your life, and all your Progenie. Abb. What Pageant's this! Ema: No Pageant, Sir in short. You are betray'd, and MAHOMET's the Traytor. Abb. What envy dares traduce him? then my heart's False to my head. Ema. Sir, if I prove it not, Dissect me into Atomes, torture me, And fix eternall infamy on my name. Abb. Produce your proofes. Ema. Your Highnesse lately stood A Bulwark to your friends, a terror to Your Enemies, you had a Royall Army Commanded by a noble Son, and though I say't, a faithfull Generall, and Officers Trusty as truth it selfe, while these stood firm In your esteem, as they deserved well, (For what have your brave Son, and my poor self Not done, that men could do, for your just honour? You do not hold one Scepter in your hand, But such as we have put there, or else kept From being torn away:) whilst these I say Had power with you, not your proudest foes Or Treason had a tongue or hand to hurt you; But we must fall, that they may rise, upon Yours, and our ruines, and your credulity Has given them way: pardon the plainnesse, sir. Abb. Go on, go on. Ema. Sir, it was your misfortune T'advance the impudent pleasant ALLYBEG To such a dangerous height as made him giddy, And mad with pride: he is the very person That having got your ear, wrought all our ruines, Intending yours: which thus he acts; first having Obtain'd the Princes fall, disbanded th'Army; He has consulted with the mal-contents T'advance himself: has rais'd a bank of money, And now is levying of a Guard— Abb. That Guard On second thoughts I fear'd. Hyd. As well you might. Abb. Well, who are of his party? Ema. His pretence Is specious (as all Traytors must be) so He has allured some innocent Persons to him (For such we yet are willing to believe them) As ELCHEE, who yet owes you a Grudge, And so's the fitter for his purpose; he Ingag'd MATZED, MOZENDRA, and BENEFIAN, MATZED is levying in Hyrcania, But privatly, as the rest here in Town. These credit his pretence, which onely is To rescue th'Prince, and be made Guardian To SOFFIE, when he indeed intends To murder you, the Prince, and SOFFIE— Abb. What's this, you say?— Ema. Nay, good sir, hear me out. He means himself our King too and his Queen FLORADELLA, (she at least believes so) For she was usefull for him to gain you To this advancement, and the Princes fall, And rich to help his bank, and has engag'd OLYMPA, EARINA, and Madam OMAY, All these we know, besides who else as yet We've not discovered. But his confidents Are FARRABAN and the smooth tongu'd SELEUCUS He at this present gathers force in Shiras The other holds the Castle at his pleasure. Abb. If this be so, themselves convey'd away Young SOFFIE, I pray JOVE not to Heaven. Hyd. That, time will prove, we speak but what wee know. Abb. How came you by the knowledge of thus much? Ema. My Lord, my Servant VASCO has made love Long time to CLOE, FLORADELLA'S woman, And she has heard him not unwillingly: It first came out by her who boasted it To him, as an addition to her fortune. Abb. This makes me doubt the rest: sure ALLYBEG Has more brain then to trust such high designes To whores and waiting women; Sives, that let All things run through them, be they ne'r so precious. Ema. Sir, she's the closet of her Ladies secrets, 'Tis like she had this knowledge from her chiefly. Abb. By some especiall providence: O Gods! How have we sinn'd! that you upbraid us thus T'indebt us for our safeties to such low Vile things! as if the basest instrument Were good enough to save so corrupt a state! But Rome thrice ow'd her life to as vile trash, Once to a common Harlot, twice to Geese. Wise Heaven can make good work with any tool. But this me thinks requires pregnant proof, Ere it gains my belief, as now my horror. Ema. First, we attest it sir, next, your own eyes And ears may be your certain witnesses. Fail you they cannot: clap a Guard on us, Send but another Guard to OMAY'S House, There may you apprehend most of the Traitors, There at this instant hold they their black counsell. Abb. No lie can bee avouch't with thus much forehead. EMANGOLY, thou hast deserv'd much of me, And you HYDASPUS; first we cry you mercy, For our too much rigour to you both, Wee'l study an amends, if this be true, If not, you both die without further process. Ema. Sir, be it so. Hyd. Yes, so my Liege we'd have it. Abb. Come then, our selfe will goe to OMAY'S house, 'Tis worth our pains, you shall attend me thither. Ema. Your Majestie still meets our wishes neerer. Abb. Is BELTAZAR engag'd? Ema. No surely sir, We believe him too honest, and a spirit Too great to truckle to base ALLYBEG, Though he had the mis-fortune to be us'd I'th Princes ruine, we might see regret, And an unwillingnesse in him to th'action. Abb. He did indeed, I think obey for fear; Nor did he more then what our own commands Did urge, so we've no ground for wrath to him; Him then we'l keep in favour still, and call T'attend us to unkennell the base Fox. First send for FARRABAN, and make him sure, Then plant a Guard upon the Cittadell. Ema. It will be best sir. Abb. Guard attend us here. FLORADELLA, OLYMPA, EARINA, OMAY, CLOE. Women are still most forward in great actions. I wonder yet none of the Lords are come. Oly. All in Good time Madam—'tis a close day, Me thinks it 'bodes not well, I like it not. Flo. The day is as it should be, close and dark, And fittest for our Plot that must be secret. Ear. The Sun perhaps mourns for poor FATYMA. Oly. O that sad accident takes up my mind, I'm almost statue still. Oma. 'Twas sad and cruell. Flo. Ladies, you see 'tis more then time we help Poor Persia from ruining her selfe, To which she hasts amaine.— Clo. Madam, my Lords. MAHOMET-ALLY-BEG, ELCHEE, MOZENDRA, BENEFIAN, FLORADELLA, OLYMPA, EARINA, OMAY, CLOE. Save you Ladies. Elc. Hail beauties all a-row. Flo. Hail Persia's Genius. Oly. Hail my honour'd Lord. Mah. Are we all here? Moz. I see not FARRABAN. Elc. FARRABAN wanting! Mah. What makes him so slow! Flo. Slow, y'are all Snails to us, you must confesse The Ladies still most active: we'l not lose Our shares of glory. Elc. FARRABAN not here! I like it not. Flo. My Lord, he's gain'd already. Ear. So we are all I hope. Flo. I'l engage for him, What you here order him, he shall be ready Upon first intimation to perform. He may be busie searching SOFFIE up, You heard the Kings threats if he were not found. Mah. Would he were found. Flo. Let not that trouble you. If we cannot recover him, give out He is baptiz'd, and so incapable; 'Tis no new way, in India, ASSAPH did it, And well it took.—My Lord, you are not cheerfull. Elc. MAHOMET'S troubled. Oly. 'Tis for PARRABAN. [To Olym. Ben. What! doe's my Lord Court her, to be her Guardian? [To Moz. Now had I rather talke of Love and Court-ship To EARINA then these state-affaires. How well she looks! Moz. Fie, Flesh-flie, hold your peace. [Secret. Flo. My Lord, I hope you flag not? will you saile [To Mah. Bravely three quarters of your course, out-ride Many a storm, break thousand raging waves, And then sink in the Haven? Mah. My soul is dull, And dreads some treachery; never till now Knew I what 'twas to fear. Flo. Come, sacrifice To confidence, she'l carry you through all; I'l promise largely when we come to th'Loane, More then you must expect to bring them on. Ear. But sure we came not here to whisper, sirs. Oma. No, I did think our businesse had been publique. Mah. Rouze my dull soul—Publique indeed it is, And private too it must be, the Consult Private, the benefit most publique shall be— Flo. Now he's himselfe againe. Death! dead ith'nest! [aside. Mah. And reach to all: old men shall owe that short Portion of life by natures course they hold, And reverend Matrons their white age, to us: Those shall thank us, they see their manly Sons, Spend in soft exercise their peacefull time, And that themselves sit in their chimny-corners, Telling the loved stories of their youth, And feel not at their wither'd throats the swords Of foes, to force them to detect their wealth; And these, that they enjoy their blooming daughters Unravished, and see their Grand-children Come skipping on their aged knees, and not Sprawling upon the Enemies hostile Speares. The Nurse shall owe to us, that her dear childe Doth suck her milk still, and not she its blood, So to sustaine a while her famish'd soul. The Gods shall be indebted unto us, That still their Temples stand, and do not crack In sacrilegious flames; the Genius Of every City, that he is not forc'd To leave his walk, or wander 'bout the ruines: The dead that fury ransack not their Urnes, And puffe their ashes in the face of light: Th'unborn, that we procur'd them time to ripen, And that they fell not, blasted ere they blow'd. The benefit shall to the meanest Swaine Extend, that toyls in the Parmenian fields, And farthest parts the Persian name doth reach, To us his morning, and his evening thanks, Shall he ere pay, for that his wretched eyes See not the battering hoofs of wastfull Troops Trample his hopefull Corne, and springing grasse, For that the sheafes ar'nt from his reaping hand Torn by the Foe, nor his full Barns blaze high With dreadfull flames, nor stalled Cattel low Under the plundering Souldiers hungry blade; For that the hated noise of bellowing Drums, Fright him not from his Plough with fear of pressing. Ben. He shepheardesses thanks might promise too, For having time to sing still, and make Chaplets. To Moz. in secret. Moz. Those thanks shall you reap. Ben. Those I chiefly covet, I soon can tell them how they may requite me. Mah. This generall good must unto all accrue, By our incountring of that violent torrent Of ruine, that flows strongly towards all, And will ore-whelm us, if not stopt in time. Is not our aged King (alas!) given up To dotage, and unneedful jealousie? Has he not cast down his chiefe prop, the Prince? Disbanded his strong Armies? so the Empire Lies open to her Foes, like as a Vineyard To the wild beasts, its fence being trodden down.— Elc. Princes were given to defend their subjects, If he'l quit the Protection of us, Yet must not we quit our own safeties. Mah. True, Doth not the royall stock decay apace? One of the best and fairest branches of it, Is torn away to death— Oly. O that the Tyrants Selfe had excused her!— Mah. An act so horrid, The Sun ne'r shin'd out since, but hid for shame His face with clouds; the other forc'd to hide, Perhaps in some foul shed, poor and forlorn, His innocent head, from his hard Grand-father, And injur'd Sire, and yet he is our hope. Pines not the Prince, whose fight no foe could 'bide, Without his fight, in a condition Beneath the merit of the greatest foe? Melts not the sweetest Princesse in the world, In her own tears? she, worth a brighter fortune Then Earth can give her, yet abides the worst.— Ear So much the worse, as fallen from best. Mah. You Ladies should resent this most of all.— Oma. Who doth not, hath no sence. Ear. No soul. Flo. No honour. Mah. Yet the old King's so fast in his dead sleep, So lost in his strong Lethargy, he feels, Nor sees, at least regards, nothing of this. I'st then not time to 'wake him, and to stop The gulph of ruine that thus opes and gapes To swallow us all in its hollow entrailes?— I see it in your faces, you all think It more then time; nor let the cure seem harsh: No lesse then fire, cauterizing, searing, Can salve this sore; tis Arms I mean must do it; We must cast Rampants 'gainst so strong a tide, Nor think't at all unjust; “That War is just “That's necessary, and those arms religious, “When there's no hope left otherwise but in them. The Prince restor'd, the King once shewn his error, SOFFIE return'd to safety, how will all Applaud the Actors! what is there you wish, But will flow in unto you with advantage! Your greatest thoughts will be accomplished, As easily as desir'd. Would you my Lord ELCHEE, requite your selfe for th'injury Late done to you? now, now's the time to do it. Elc. I see, nor will let slip the fair occasion. Mah. Would you, MOZENDRA, arrive at th'hopes You, I know, have, of things worthy your merit, And daring soul? this, this is the way. Moz. I shall improve the opportunity. Mah. Would you, BENEFIAN, render your self Worthy, as the addition that honours, And fair estate can make you, (and they're great In womens eyes) to teach the bravest Lady Ith'Persian Court to give and take a flame, (For you, they say, are amorous) now's the time. Ben. And I will strike, Sir, whilst the Iron's hot. He 'has taken me in the right vein i'faith. Mah. And is there any thing that you, sweet Ladies, Can on your Pillows wish for? now command it.— Flo. As ther's no Lady sure but has her longings. Mah. Is there a seat in all the Empire Fairer then other? or an air cooler? Before your feet that place shall spread its self, And court you to accept it. Is there ever A Knight, or smooth chin'd youth your eye commends Unto your heart? he is your ready servant.— Oma. And we may hap employ that priviledge. Mah. Are your thoughts higher? would you make your fortunes Even with your beauties, equall unto Princes, Fit for to meet with crowned Monarchs loves? This is the way t'atchieve all these, and more: To be, alive great Queens and dead, bright starrs. You shall be call'd the Saviours of your Country, A name more dear then Monarch, the sole honour O'th'present age, the grand obligers of The next, and MAHOMET, your humble servant. Flo. Admir'd height of Policy, and Courtship? Mah. Cast then, sweet Beauties to so great a work But your lose Ornaments, and receive greater. Borrow but of your fair ear a Pendent, A Carkanet of your Neck, or of your brest A Gem, and be return'd more then a Crown. And you brave Knights, shine forth in brandish'd steel, Like to so many Gods of war, and be Ador'd as he is Nor can I expresse (Such is the dearth and poverty of words) With how much dearnesse of affection You'l be received of all loyall hearts. With what resolution of fidelity! With how great Piety! with what tears of joy! Will any Gates dare to be shut against you? Or any Envy to oppose your Progresse? Up then, and undertake this brave exploit With that courage, and those fair hopes, wherewith Such just great actions are to be attempted, That under your colours, and protection Of your Fortune Persia may be Again ennobled and made more then free. Elc. My Lord whilst uttering this, I wish't your voice Had been as loud as STENIOR'S, or ram'd thunder, That' t'might been heard through ABBAS thirty Kingdomes, And strike upon the Centre with an Eccho Loud as the acclamation it deserves, It would have done more good then forty Troops To our great purpose, of which men and money I take to be chief elements: for men, My MATZEDS's Levies prosper as our wishes Design'd them in Hyrcania. Mah. And in Larr SELEUCUS grows as fast: once on their March, They'l gather like a snow-ball. Elc. Here I've gain'd As many friends as when I can appoint them A Rendevouz, will make a Regiment. Mah. I have as many too, besides my Guard, To help up which the bounteous FLORADELLA Disbursed freely. Flo. I have yet my Lord, Fifty thousand Crowns towards the service. Mah. And is your purse, sweet Mine, as fathomlesse as is your wit?—this is a brave example. Flo. Sir, my good will. Oly. (Shall I go lesse then she? I will not, though it half undoes me)—Sir, I have as much at your command. Flo. (I knew She would not be behind me) Mah. Excellent Lady! All I can say, is, you shall pay your self For your great bounty, with your own desires. Ear. (Shall we go below these? they'l scorn us then.) Oma. Faith Madam, I can't spare such sums, let you To Madam Omay. And I go halfes, and mak't betwixt us then. [secret. Ear. Content.)—My Lord, this Lady, and my selfe.

(They that least need are still the greatest hold-fasts) Oma. 'Till be the welcomer that comes unlook'd for. Mah. Y'are bounteous Ladies, and shall shine for this, Below in story, 'above ith'Firmament. Ben. You, Ladies, have done well, but we'l yet more, Not to extoll our selves, or slight your bounties, You give but part, we all: you hazzard gold, We bloud, and sweat, and life, and our gold too. Mah. Brave Colonell! this toil shall buy you rest, And furnish you with stories for your age: Each skar you get esteem of as a favour From warrs great Goddesse sent to win you hearts: Men are not more enamour'd of their beauties, Then fairest Ladies are of mens known valours. Oma. (How hee takes every bird with its owne lure!) [aside. Moz. Where, where shall we begin? I would be at it. Flo. Spoke like an Angell! Mah. Here in Town I think. Elc. Do you intend to seize on the Kings person? Mah. What else? Elc. Then it were easier done abroad, If you could train him to some house of pleasure. Flo. For that, let me alone; i'le undertake it. Mah. He cannot though they grew, pick up a Force That can made head 'gainst us in time; but should he, Which is unlike, sure he'd give us conditions. If we get him, we'l give him Articles To signe, the effect you know, what else we then Think fit, we can cast in. Elc. Resist! my Lord, Wrong not your Judgement once to think it can be Are we not strong enough to force the Guards? Mah. Yes sure. Elc. Then let JOVE and HERCULES Come take his part, they too, shall be our Prisoners. Flo. Brave fiery Hero! Mah. I've a Proclamation Already drawn, luring as words can make it. Oly. Now for the time? Elc. What if we presently Dispatch advice unto our friends abroad To put themselves upon their march towards us, And when we know the time they can be with us, Give our friends here the watchword, and to horse? All this, I hope, may be sometime to morrow. Moz. It may, it may, we by to morrow night May all be ready, and night's the best time too. Ben. The Sun shall see us Conquerors when he rises. Mah. Your Counsel's good. Ben. But at the hour we rise The Citadel here must advance your colours. Mah. It shall.—Chear up sad mother Persia We will retrive again thy age of gold, ASTRÆA shall come down once more, and fix In thee her fair Tribunall: those impostumes Rather then children, that broke from thee, Thy factious sons, I mean shall fall in ruine, Whilst thy true births shall grace thy happy bosome, And thou on them bestow a thousand blessings. Then Treason— Elc. Hark! what noise is that? [a noise without Oma. Look out. Clo. O heaven! the King and FARRABAN! Mah. My soul! Is he a Traitor! Ben. Well, I only came To contemplate the Ladies beauties. Oly. Fly! Fly all! Clo. Alas! the Guards spread all about. [to them ABBAS, EMANGOLY, BELTAYAR, HYDASPUS, VASCO, FARRABAN in irons, GUARD.

Oly. We've innocence enough to trust to yet. Om. We meant nothing but well to the whole Empire. Hyd. So sculks the owle 'fore the Suns golden ray, As these black souls do at the face of justice. Elc.

Varlot 'twas thy self. Abb. So, peal, do, do, Elc. I yet fear FARRABAN. Far. Alas! my Lord, will not these chains resolve you? Elc. Craft, craft all. Hyd. Faith, this is no fashion; He has confess'd enough to hang you all, But not discover'd. Mah. Confess'd!— Far. Why should I spend My last breath in avouching lies and Treason? Mah. A bowstring stop that breath—my Liege, we were Designing— Abb. Mischief.—ball not, impudent head! Ungratefull Monster! cause I raised thee From they foul dunghil, will no meaner seat Then a Throne please thee? and mine own too? wretch! Guard apprehend them, to close Prison with them— Flo.

Sir, who ere was your spie upon our Actions, Make much of himhe, did you timely service— Hyd. O unheard impudence!—slit his windpipe some. Moz. The truth is, we intended to take arms, Not to disthrone you, as you intimate But to restore the Prince, and make you see Your error in your unjust anger to him. Abb. Peace impudence, the rack shall squeeze out more. Moz. Not more then truth, and that you have already. Elc. So may we find your favour, as 'tis truth He tells you, and no farther stretcht our aim. Abb. Others did then Guard, bind them, and away. You may EMANGOLY, and BELTAZAR Take their Confessions: force from that base serpent Pointing to Floradella.

Use CLOE gently, and perswade her, VASCO, To detect all. Vas. I'l do my best, my Liege. Abb. Away with them. HYDASPUS, wait on us, Double our Guards: we will to sacrifice To gracious Heaven, and make publique prayer, That sav'd us from what we knew not to fear MIRZA, PAGE.

I promis'd FATYMA I'd follow her, and I will keep my word, 'Twil in some part excuse the wrong I did her, The sweet soul claims it of me: I ne'r sleep But still I see her beckning me away. However DORIDO, had I not better Die bravely like a Roman, then pine here A slave? I'le die too, though thou dost not help me, And bequeath thee a Curse for thy unkindnesse.

ABBAS, EMANGOLY, BELTAYAR, METHICULI, HYDASPUS. ALKAHEM. VASCO. MAHOMET-ALLYBEG, ELCHEE, MOZENDRA, EARINA, OLYMPA, OMAY, CLOE, Officers, Souldiers, Guard. First, my EMANGOLY, and you, my Lords METHICULI, HYDASPUS, ALKAHEM, We here revoke our sentence against you Of Banishment, and impower you to sit With us in judgment, on these dire Delinquents. Ema. We thank your Majesty, and glory more In that we are capable of serving you, Then in the honour which you grace us with. Oly. (They'l complement our lives away at last) Ben. (Then we are judg'd already;—wel, th'other day I studied speeches for the Ladies, now [secret. I want one to the People; but,—lets see— The common place is to avoid ill company. A curse on these state matters!) Abb. Next we here Degrade that Viper ALLY-BEG from all Those places, or of publique trust, or Honour, To which too rashly we advanced him. Those which he held of yours, EMANGOLY, We do to you restore. Ema. Your Grace shall find Me faithfull as at first. Abb. The Treasurer-ship We do conferr on you, METHICULI. Met. My service, as i'm able, shall requite it. Mah. May they requite you as I would have done. Alk. Bold Traytor! cannot armed justice awe thee? Abb. Now BELTAZAR, produce your proofs against These criminals. Bel. They're guilty all of Treason: CLOE accuses that impostum'd monster MAHOMET, to have forg'd the whole conspiracy, But not without the help of FLORADELLA— Flo. (A curse on that loose Gossip. Mah. And you too.) Abb. Give them no name but Traytors. Bel. First they meant To shift away the Prince, dissolve the Army, That no force might oppose the Traytors rising. You Majestie—(the horror of it choaks My utterance)—your sacred Majestie— Mah. So, try again. Bel. This viperous woman should Have poysoned.— Mah. So, now 'tis out—would she had. Bel. And FARRABAN, SOFFIE, then held the Castle, At the devotion of this monstrous man, Who aim'd to set the Crown on his own head, Having already gotten a strong Guard, Towards which that strumpet did disburse a Mass Of ready Treasure, making still her Purse As common to him, as her wicked body.— Flo. You might preserve the modesty of the Court. Bel. To this end be their Levies afoot too; In Larr SELEUCUS, MATZED in Hyrcania, Are raising Forces; so that this lewd woman, And FARRABAN, and sly SELEUCUS, were Chiefe complices, that knew his utmost aime; The other we believe drawn in, as onely Crediting his pretence to free the Prince, And MATZED'S Levies are on ELCHEE'S score. Elc. Urge that my Lord. Oly. Oma. Ear. Yes, yes, sir, urge that home. Abb. Monster, what say you? knew the rest you meant Your selfe their King? Mah. They knew as much as I did. Oly. 'Tis false. Moz. That thou wert worthy but to bear A Sword, that I might claim the combat 'gainst thee I'd write it on thy heart, in stabbes, thou lyest. Mah. A brave Rodomantado! Hyd. This vile man, Given up to Treason late, and now despaire, Accuses these but to have company In's fall. Ben. True my good Lord—Come, you and I Were Comrades once. Ema. This I indeed believe. Mah. The more the merrier. Moz. Hear my gracious Lord, He intimates as much before your Grace. Elc. (What if I say I levyed in Hyrcania, To Mozendra. With an intent to help the King, and ballance MAHOMETS strength, having the greater hopes For doing him service so unexpected? Moz. 'Twill gaine no faith: and then 'twas Treason too, [Secret. To list without Commission: know your doom first, If you fall, urge it: some will credit you, 'Twill beget pitty to your memory I'th'vulgar, who are still fond of the wretched.) Alk. These persons could not be so lost to sence. Being noble, as t'advance so vile a thing Over themselves. Oly. We scorn him for our Groom. Hyd. His envy and his rage will peal us too Anon, I think. Met. How strong is malice in thee, Pernicious wretch! thou car'dst not how foul Thy Treasons were on earth, nor weighst thou now How great thy plagues for them shall be in hell. Bel. Disburden yet thy soul of so much guilt, And speak these innocent in what they are so. Mah. Your selfe's not innocent, good Rhetorician.— Hyd. I thought so, slit his impudent throat some body. Mah. You did, as much as I, exasperate The King against his Son. Bel. If this be true, I here beseech your Grace command me stand Among the Traytors:—Come come, Officers, bind My hands, I am accused here of treason Abb. You, more then feignedly, did act his friend, And O that I had heard your pregnant reasons, So urg'd to save him with an equall eare! Bel. Heaven knows, I urg'd them strongly as I durst. Mah. The Tyrant's selfe's not innocent.— Alk. Bold head! Mah. He's guilty of his Sonnes blood, and FATYMA'S too. I was but's instrument. Met. O extasie! Abb. Varlet, the guilt is thine, though the grief mine, That I gave faith unto thy forgeries. Proceed Lord BELTAZAR. Bel. Sir, hoping these May yet be worthy of your timely mercy; What have I but t'inveigh against those other? Look up, fair Mother Persia, and see Thy selfe redeem'd, put off the horrid fright, Thy plotted ruine late amaz'd thee with. Now shall not thy fair breast be stained with Thy best Sons blood, but freed of thy worst. Had this gone on, th'hadst been but thine own prey, Th'hadst seen thy Prince that toyl'd so oft for thee, Groaning his soul out into empty air, The hopeful blossom nipt as soon as blown; Thy aged King swell'd up with deadly poyson, And burning as in Ætna till he'd burst: And impious MAHOMET upon thy Throne, Unworthy of thy Gallies; and this strumpet, His fine loose Queen.— Mah. That yet I never meant. Flo. The more wretch thou, so oft to swear it to me. Mah. The more fool thou though, ever to believe me. Bel. Thy noblest Sons torn, some to cruell death, And some to servile misery, worse then that; This was the sight prepared for thine eyes. Mah. And it had been a brave one. Abb. Cursed monster! No sence of guilt? no teares! can no remorse Touch thy scar'd Conscience? Mah. Yes, I see my guilt; Guilty of folly I am, to trust a woman To keep for me, what for her self she cannot, A secret; tears I could profusedly shed, Tears of just wrath, and for each one that drops, Afford a curse too, that I sped no better. I'de spend my soul in sighs, could they but scald thee: To be so near a Crown, and reach it not! O Hell and Furies! Abb. In thy soul they're all. Ema. Proceed to judgement sir. Mah. Tyrant, remember, In me thou judgest thy own Cause; I meant No more to thee, then thou didst to thy Father, And brother too, and that for the same reason. Ema. Prodigious boldnesse! sir, regard him not. Abb. Monster, since thou hast toyl'd to be ungrateful, And with thy Treasons to out-vie my favours, To let thee die were too much pitty to thee, Nor is there a death equall to thy guilt; Besides, we having so much honoured thee, And sworn thou ne'r shouldst feel death from our hand, We'l keep our Oath, but leave it to our Heir, A strict command, that on my funerall day Thou dyest the ancient death of boats. Mal. Then have I Great MITHRIDATES for my pattern. Abb. Mean while, Officers, lead him to the publique market, There let the common Hangman bore his eyes out. In a Dungeon shall he sustain his life, With what he gets by begging onely. Mah. Nay, I'l then sustain my soul with full mouth'd curses, To thee meant, and the rest of my undoers, Especially that open Sex, whose souls are So loose, they cannot keep them in their breasts, But they will still swim on their lips. Abb. VASCO, To thee we do decree his whole Estate, And our best thanks for thy discovery. Vas. I humbly thank your Majestie. Abb. Let Souldiers Go pull down all his Palaces and Statues, And make a Jakes there where his chief house stood. Ema. Admired Justice! Omnes. Equall, equall, Justice! Mah. Do, do, ball on. Abb. You, strumpet, are the next. Mah. But that I scorn to ask it, might I heare Her sentence, and I'de triumph in mine own. Flo. Envious villaine. Abb. Away with him, he shall not Give so much pleasure to his envious soul. Mah. Write on my dust, IN HIGH ATTEMPTS HE DY'D. All ills betide you.— Abb. Lead that impious wretch To th'publique Market, &amp; there beat her brains out, Ith'ancient way ordain'd for Poysoners: As for the murder of her Queen STATIRA, Base GIGIS dy'd, then burn her limbs with Cats dung. Flo. Mercy! great sir. Abb. Thou hast too much in dying, But that we are not rigorous to thy Sex.— Away with her. Flo. O this is a sad fall. Abb. All her Estate to CLOE we confer; 'Tis fit she have reward t'incourage others, Though she not meant to do us good, she did it. Clo. Indeed my Gracious Lord, I ever meant it, I humbly thank your Majestie. Vas. See now, CLOE, [Secret. I counsell'd you for th'best. Come, I'm still constant, Our businesse here is over, we'l to better. Abb. Take FARRABAN with the rest, and strangle him. Far. O mercy, mercy! Abb. Quick, away with him. Far. The Citadell cost me faire; O dire ambition! Abb. The Citadel we give thee ALKAHEM. Alk. I hope to do you better service in it. Abb. We doubt it not.—Now ELCHEE. Ben. (Now, now, I feel the Bow-string at my throat. Moz. Nay sure, [Secret. He'l let us die like Souldiers.) Abb. Though we credit The good of your intention, yet your life, Is by your hasty error forfeited, But that we give you, and confine you onely To th'Ile of Ormus, whence on good behaviour, We may recall you. Elc. Thanks dread Soveraigne. I hope my carriage will induce you to it. My feare was never so great of your justice, As griefe for the rash error I ran into, And so insnar'd my friends. Met. Troth, I believe him. Ben. Sure he'l send us thither too? MOZENDRA, Are there any handsome Ladies there, canst tell? Moz. I care not so there be a Book, I'l never [Secret. Converse but with the dead hereafter I. Ema. This true repentance speaks him noble. Abb. Yes, Your two friends shall attend you. Elc. A noble mercy. Moz. Long live the Gracious ABBAS! Ben. More then live! Met. My Lord, my love to you remaines still firm, To Elchee. And eggs me on to prompt a way unto you, How you may happily avoid exilement. [Secret. The Kings rigour, I know, will not extend To th'Ladies lives, yet in the fright they stand in, They will do any thing may get them mercy: Urge them to promise, if they have their lives To give the King in gratitude, those summes They ingag'd for to the Traytors; then be you Their speaker to him, and he can't in honour (Urg'd by my meditation) but receive The favour as from you, and shew you grace. Elc. My Lord my humble thanks, I will attempt it. Abb. But MATZED, for examples sake must die, Elchee whispers with the Ladies Being ith'very act of Treason, raising Of Arms against us: You my Lord HYDASPUS, Take a Brigade of our own Guards, and hast Down to Hyrcania to apprehend him, Strike off his head, to you the Government Of that fair Province we assigne, until If he deserves it, we recall Duke ELCHEE. Hyd. I wish he may, mean while, I shall be carefull. Abb. EMANGOLY, send you some trusty person To Shiras, arm'd, to seize SELEUCUS there, And strike off his head too. Ema. My Liege, I will. Abb. These Ladies still expect,—how shall we use them? Ear., Oma. O my good Lord. Oly. There's mercy in his looks. Ema. Sir, they'are beneath your anger, they can't hurt you, Nor stands it with the honour of great States, To take strict notice of vain womans actions. Abb. Well, mercy is no lesse a virtue royal, Then justice, and 'tis fit we shew some, since Heaven has shewn us so much: we pardon you Ladies, hereafter pray avoid state-matters. Oma., Ear. We will! we will, my Lord. Oly. Our humble thanks. Omnes, Long live King ABBAS! long, long-live the King! Elc. You'l keep your words. [To the Ladies. Oly: Far. Oma. Yes, yes, my Lord, we will. Elc. May't please your Majestie, these noble Ladies, (Not to say by my instinct) do resent So heartily your royal favour to them, As to their powers, to attempt gratitude, Whereas their error late involv'd them in A promise of considerable summes, To'advance what they thought duty, but proves treason, As testimonies of their thankfulnesse For pardoning them that fault, they humbly pray Your sacred Majestie to accept those sums, Towards the raising of your force again. Tis 'mong them all an hundred thousand Crowns. Em. A brave amends! Alk. A noble gratitude! Abb. Ladies, we thank your loves. Oly. And we your mercy. Abb. METHICULI'S Treasurer. Oly.

Hark! hark! Abb. ELCHEE, for improving thus Your interest with the Ladies to our service, We do revoke your sentence of exilement. Elc. My best thanks and indeavours, still shall serve you. Met.

Why pluck'st thou then their work out of the hand Of Justice, and become thy own revenger, When she would surely have don't, and better? Mir. I feel the poyson working—O—be happy. Nym. Hast IFFIDA, some antidote may help yet. Pag. Nay, spare that paines, not natures self can help him. 'Twas strong enough. Nym. To break my heart, I hope. Pag. It works with me too: my eyes swim in death, And dizzinesse tosse over all my braines. Iff. Fie, DORIDO, thou art the greatest Traytor Of all, to poyson thy dear Lord. Mir. Peace fool, He's faithfull, and my good deliverer. ABBAS, EMANGOLLY, BELTAZAR, ALKAHEM, Servants. [to them No, that is yet my part, I'm thy deliverer. Rise injur'd Son, arise and meet thy freedom. Mir. Who's that? Iff. The King. Mir. The Tyrant: in good time He comes to see me rescu'd from his rage. Nym. His eyes blast me; I can't, with patience, see him. But what means this yet? why are these friends with him? Pag. All are prov'd false and mock our misery. Nym. And is this then a spectacle of pleasure? That I could form a curse great as his guilt! Abb. Spare them, sweet daughter, if I yet am worthy So near alliance to so bright a vertue— Mir. O death, why com'st no faster? Ema. Heavens! what means he? Bel. He thinks he comes to torture him. Alk. He looks ill. Abb. No art of words can now more aggravate My guilt then mine own Conscience: nor dost thou Feel sharper pangs of Grief then I of horror. I'm undeceived, I see my hasty error, And hadst thou now a window into my brest. Thou wouldst confesse th'unfeign'd integrity Of my repentance, when thou seest my soul Weep (freely) tears of blood to bath her crime in. Mir. Crocodiles tears. Ema. Indeed, my Lord you erre. Abb. Thou err'st, brave Son, for yet i'l call thee so, And will henceforth appear a Father to thee, I've been a Tyrant, nay a Monster long, Which as I have bewail'd, I will redresse, Repentance has made Rivers of mine eyes, My eyes weep themselves blind for loss of thine. My breast is hardened as brawn with strokes, My head turn'd grey, with sorrow more then age. Insense makes the offended Gods relent. For that, i'l spend my very soul in sighs. “To be penitent bears a pardon with it: A pardon, I that yet ne'r beg'd of any, Now beg of thee: A Father of a Son, Let the relation at least obtain it. Nym. So when the house is burnt the fire goes out. O that this true remorse (for so I think it) Had come before, when yet it had been usefull! Bel. Madam, 'tis ne'r to late to redresse wrongs. Nym. Yes, when the wrongd's not capable of redress. The Prince (alas!) inflamed with despair. Got his unhappy Page to give him poyson. Abb. O Heaven! and slightest thou our Penitence? Mir. Poyson so strong defies all remedies, As it will soon make me all injuries. Ema. O Act of Horror! Bel. Dire event of wrongs. Alk. Which when in time we'are carelesse to redresse We justly, when we would do't, are deny'd it. Abb. I mourning to my grave must ever go then. At least, before thou leav'st this upper world, O speak thy self but reconciled to me. Mir. I freely do it, and implore your pardon, If I, exasperated with my wrongs, Have vented any undecent words of you. Of other crimes towards you my soul acquits me. Abb. And mine own too: this piety adds load Unto my grief, and melts my very soul. METHICULIE, SOFFIE. See sir, their joy has drown'd them all in tears. Sof. This looks not yet like joy. Iff. Ah! no, my Lord. All joyes have fled us. Alk. The brave Prince, tir'd out With suffering wrongs, took poyson. Sof. O just Gods! Met. Not just, they are grown Tyrants too, &amp; mock Our best intentions—O— Abb. What a blest day Had this been, had not this draught clouded it! That balefull draught descends in a dire storm, And not ecclipses but our Sun-shine onely, But batters with fierce dropps our springing hopes! How mightst thou else have triumph'd in the Justice Done on the cursed causers of thy ruine! Base ALLYBEG, and impious FLORADELLA, And all the rest of their dire Complices This day fell sacrifices to thy wrath. SOFFIE is found too, and doth here attend thee. Mir. Turn then your love to him, to him requite My wrongs, and from him too expect my duty. Now shall I die with much a lighter heart. Since I have liv'd to hear those Traytors fall. Nym. O this I ever hop'd for from heavens Justice, And grieve the more that thou despairedst of it. Mir. I come sweet FATYMA-Father, farewell— Use SOFFIE like a Son.— Abb. O that Heaven would Let me excuse thee! Mir. SOFFIE,—Farewel Obey thy Grandsire—as thou wouldst do me— Forget my wrongs—and eschew Tyranny— Sof. Ah! that I could forget sense, and turn stone! Mir. Adieu sweet Spous.— Nym. O! Mir. From thee I hardliest go!— But thy grief will not suffer thee, I know, To be long from me.— Nym. O my wretched ears! Do you heare this, and will you ever hear Any thing after it! O woefull eyes! Why at this wailfull sight drop you not out? Or, frighted, recoile deep into you holes! O stubborn heart! can't all this shiver thee? Am I turn'd Rock too! Mir. Friends adieu—make ore To my young Son, the love to me you bore— Ema. O that I could not hear! Met. Or I could help! Mir. Yet love my memory.— Bel. O Grief! Alk. O Anger! That griefe is all we can! Mir. Thou DORIDO, Art to attend me— to the shades below— Pag. Yes my dear Lord. Iff. O that he'd gone before. Mir. I shall again live—and on some sad Stage Be mourn'd.—“Great wrongs reach further then one Age.— O—O. [Dies. Abb. He's gone, he's gone, break heart and follow! Omnes, O Heavens! Nym. Stay winged spirit, stay and take Me with thee, at least let me suck thy last breath. Bel. Madam, forbear, you will infect your self. Nym. O Gods! what have been my deserts, to be Thus punished! or if such be my deserts, Why am I yet not punish'd more, with death? Yet that were to give end unto my woes: To joyne me with him, were to make me happy: That happiness I shortly will obtain In spight of fate, if not from thy kind hand O ATROPOS, from mine own grief at least: Mean while—lie soft, O loved Corps, and thou Adored soul, if love to earthly creatures Remain in death, think of me in thy shade, And oft Petition Fate to send me to thee. Sof. Unhappy DORIDO! how hast thou wrong'd All Ages! Alk. And shalt still be curs'd by all. Pag. Is't not too late to say, forgive pass'd errors? I hast to follow him to his shade, I'l there Wait on him too, and try to be more happy: They that behold the Sun, must see his shaddow, And who remembers my brave Lord, must cast A thought on me, and may they say thus of me; I was his faithfull servant, waited still On him in life, and death, good state and ill,— So used to obey his each command, I did it, though it to his hurt did tend.— If any fault—of mine—be known to time— Service mistaken—was my onely crime.— O—O. (Dyes. Iff. He dyes. Ema. Would 'twere our greatest losse! Abb. Our losse (alasse!) is above words to ease, And we must more then mourn it: Do thou see METHICULI, all rites of pomp and sorrow, Perform'd to that brave body: This vile trunk Of DORIDO'S, for giving his Lord poyson, We will have burnt upon his Tomb. Met. Sad office. Nym. Ah sadder sight! that 'twere my last! Methiculi and Alkahem, carry out the Princes body, and the Servants, the Pages. Abb. SOFFIE, Thou now art our, and the Empire's hope, EMANGOLY, be thou his Governour, And breed him such as you intend to serve. Ema. My care shall labour to requite the honour. Sof. And mine t'improve your honour by my profit. Abb. Daughter, your losses we can ne'r requite; Yet, as we can, let us attempt amends: But that must come from you; look ore your wishes, And be the Mistress of your own desires. Nym. 'Las! sir, what is there left for me to wish, But a short term of wretched life? mean while, Some humble Country seat shall be my Cell, Free from the trouble of all tongues and eyes, I being unworthy either waiting their Kind deaths cold hand, to lead me to my Lord. Abb. If that be your desire, you must enjoy it, But we could wish we could deserve you still. Nym. Wilt thou partake of my retirement, IFFIDA? Iff. Madam, it would seem hard to me, to spend My years, which my youth promise will be many, In solitude—I'm an ill comforter,— And then, my fortunes are before me too. Nym. Be happy in them. Ema. Poor ingratitude! Nym. Farewell, great sir, if ever you remember You had a Daughter-in-law deserv'd your love, Pay it to my poor Son, at least forget not, You had a Son that did deserve it well. Abb. To him we'l pay the love we ow'd his Father. Adieu sweet Princesse—BELTAZAR, attend her. Nym. I thank your Grace:—Farewell my dearest Boy; But that thou still wilt dwell in my best thoughts, I would I could forget I ere was happy, Be thou so ever. Sof. Madam, if you please not To stay still with us, you'l, I hope, admit Me in your solitude to do my duty. Nym. Things of more weight will take thee up, be happy And so shall I, when sighs have spent this breath: “A mortalls happinesse begins in death. Abb. Come SOFFIE, and learn to be a Prince; But when thy hand shall close mine aged eyes, And on thy head my Diadem shall shine, Learn by my harms to eschew Tyranny; It was thy dying Fathers Legacy, And shall be mine too; and I leave thee more In that, then in my splendid wreath of Oare: “For cruell Acts in them their torment have, “Guilt on our souls, blots on our names they leave.
