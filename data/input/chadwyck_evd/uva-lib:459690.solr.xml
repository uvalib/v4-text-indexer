Israel offended hath, &amp; there's a synne amongst them found: &amp; they cannot wt h stand their foes whyle that they are polluted. &amp; I'l no more be wt h you till th'offender be dispatched. Wherefore cast lots through all your tribes, kinred, howses, &amp; men, &amp; looke on whom the lot doth fall, let that same man bee taken &amp; burnt, wt h his substance &amp; wealth because he hath transgressed Iosue I will be gone, &amp; all thinges do (lord) as thou hast commanded. The Lot on Iudas Tribe ys light, &amp; that in Zares family &amp; Zabdis house vpon Achan who ys the sonne of charmi. Achan my sonne geue glory to our Lord the god of Israell &amp; what thy fault hath bene in presence of vs all here tell Achan I see no synne's so secret, but yt's knowne to god Almighty where fore let no man synne in hope yt will concealed bee I synned haue in deede agaynst our lord: for as I stoode I saw amongst the spoyles a cloke of scarlett very good &amp; two hundred syluer sycles wt h a golden rule of fifty wc h couetously I tooke away from thence &amp; hyd them priuely wt h in the ground agaynst midst of my tabernacle, where they yet remayne vnder the earth, where wt h I did them couer.

Souldiers you see your enemyes flee before your face away hoatly pursue them, &amp; wt h ease many of them kill you may. Thou sunne agaynst Gabaon moue not vntill the people on theyr enemyes be reuengd, Nor Moone agaynst valley of Ailon Pedro My lord yt seemes the sunne stoode still in the mydst of ye heauen &amp; for the space of one whole day to go downe did not hasten So that before this tyme there hath not bene so longe a day for our lord fightinge for vs dyd voyce of a man obay &amp; slewe mo of our enemyes wt h hayle stones that fell from heauen then wt h the sword we &amp; the rest of th'Israelits haue strooken.

Iosue Princes of Israel sett your feete on the necks of these kinges. feare not, take courage, &amp; be stronge for yt's our lord that brings your foes thus low, &amp; thus will we wt h all our enemyes doe agaynst whom you shall fight, wherefore dreede not, but forth wt h go &amp; see the fyue kinges on fyue seuerall gibbetts hanged bee till night, then cast their bodyes into the caue where hyd they lye &amp; on the mouth thereof lay weighty stones: when this ys done wt h the rest of our enemyes we will fight, so let's be gone Nuncius Synce the fyue kings were slayne the citty of maceda's taken &amp; the kinge &amp; th Inhabitants there of Iosue hath strycken in the edge of the sword, &amp; spared not so much as one as wt h the kinge of Iericho, &amp; th'Inhabitants he had done. The citty of lebna our lord hath also to hym deliuered where no remaynes he left but both the kinge &amp; people killed. Lachis he lykewyse hath destroy'd, &amp; euery soule there in hath slayne, &amp; saw the citty walls pul'd downe before his eyne. where Horam kinge of Gazer, who came wt h ayde vnto Lachis he ouerthrew, &amp; vnto death put all the people lykwyse. Eglon &amp; Hebron in lyke maner he raz'd hath to the ground &amp; put vnto the sword all the soules that in them he found. Dabir he also taken hath, &amp; all the country waysted about the same, &amp; neyther kinge nor people there he spared. Briefly Iosue hath in the sword strucken all the hilly country, South, &amp; champayne, Asedoth, wt h their kinges &amp; not spar'd any, But euery thinge that breath'd hath slayne &amp; put vnto the sword from Cadesbarne to Gaza as he bidden was by our Lord who for hym fought: &amp; now he ys wt h Israel returned agayne to Galgal, where before he wt h his campe remayned. But there he's not lyke to continue longe tyme in peace &amp; quietnes for potent enemyes yet he hath, who raysinge are new forces intendinge hym t'invade, as yf you will but shew attention, you wt h your eyes &amp; eares shall see &amp; heare: so I'l be gone. Iabin kinge of Asor Hearinge what th'Israelits haue done vnto our neighbouringe countryes &amp; fearinge lest they will to vs be no lesse cruell enemyes all myne owne forces I will rayse, &amp; streight agaynst them go &amp; moue other kings, whose daunger ys no lesse then myne to do so. Wherefore to Iabab I will send, who ys the kinge of Madon &amp; to the kinge of Acsaph, &amp; vnto the kinge of Semeron &amp; to the kings that in the mountayns dwell vpon the north, &amp; to them also that inhabit on the south syde of cemeroth, &amp; in the lands of Dor, &amp; to the chananit, &amp; the Amorrheit, &amp; also to the Hetheit, pherezeit, Iebuseit, &amp; the Heveit &amp; will them that wt h all their forces they will forth wt h come &amp; ioyne their power to myne, &amp; meete me at waters of Merom where we agaynst Israell will fight, as yt stands vs vpon. &amp; syth that daunger's in delay, I will forthwt h be gone. Iosue I heare that Iabin kinge of Asor assemblede hath together new forces, wc h as many are as the sea sandes in number wt h a passinge great multitude of chariotts &amp; of horses intendinge for to sett vpon our wearyed &amp; smale forces. God Iosue be not afrayd of them, for tomorrow this same houre I'l them into thy hands deliuer, &amp; subiect to thy power in the sight of all Israel, who shall there at admyre: Their horses thou shalt houghsinew, &amp; their chariots burne wt h fyre Iosue Thankes my lord god. Vpon thy worde I'l go wt h my whole army &amp; meete them at waters of merom, &amp; sett vpon them sodaynly. Nuncius Now hath our lord all these great kings wt h their countreys &amp; people deliuered vp into the hands of the children of Israell who haue their c[h]ariots burnt wt h fyre, &amp; theyr horses houghsinewed &amp; euery soule stricken in the sword, as our Lord hath commanded And Asor, wc h of all the kingdoms once held the principality wt h Iabin that was kinge there of, he hath destroyed vtterly &amp; all the countrys round about that tooke his part, euen as by moyses god's true Seruant he before commaunded was. And all the pray the Israelits amongst them selues diuidyd when that the citties were destroyd, &amp; all the people killed And Iosue nothinge did omitt, not so much as one word of all that moyses had before commaunded from our lord. And a great tyme yt was that Iosue did wt h these kings fight for not one citty yielded yt self, sauinge only the Hetheit who dyd in Gabaon dwell: for our lord had the rest forsaken for their enormious sinnes, &amp; would not yieald till they were stryken &amp; therefore did no mercy fynde, but wholly were destroyed &amp; now their lands to th'Israelits by Iosue are deliuered to be possest accordinge to their tribes, &amp; peaceablely they do inioy the same, &amp; are resisted by no enemy. The number of the kings that in the foresayd warres slayne bee by moyses &amp; by Iosue do amount to thirty three. Where of two were by moyses slayne, kings of Basan &amp; Hesebon. By Iosue thirty one, the kings of Iericho, Hai, &amp; Hebron, Hierusalem, Ierimoth, Lachis, Eglon, Dabir Herma, Gazer Adullam, Gader, Hered, lebna, Bethel, Aphec, Opher, Maceda, Taphua, Saron, Asor, Acsaph, Thenac, Madon Mageddo, Iachanan, Dor, Galgal, Thersa, cades &amp; Semeron. These countryes gott by seuen yeares warres by Iosue are diuided Now amongst neene tribes &amp; a halff, &amp; other lands yet not conquered wc h god hath promis'd for to geue vnto their hands here after for moyses did to two tribes &amp; a halff portions deliuer on th'East syde Iordan ere he dyed. But no part ys allotted vnto the Leuits in the land: only to them's assigned citties &amp; suburbs to dwell in, &amp; for feedinge their cattell, &amp; sacrifices &amp; the victimes of the god of Israell. And peace they now inioy, as God to Abraham had promised when from his natyue soyle by his commandment he departed. So that god hath his promisse kept, for no more generall warre here after they shall haue, though diuerse tribes may haue particular What more ys to be sayd or done, Iosue hym self will shew, who wt h the princes here of Israell comes: wherefore adew. Iosue Princes you see that quietly this land we do possesse &amp; that all things performed are, wc h god did say to Moyses. And though there many nations bee remayninge yet vnconquered yet courage take, for by our lord to you they'l be deliuered in their due tyme, wc h in one yeare he suffred not to bee, lest the land became wildernes, &amp; wild beasts therein multiply, &amp; you deuour: But he'l by little &amp; litle your foes expell &amp; then the land wholly deliuer to the children of Israell. for hither to he hath fought for you, &amp; so he will do still yf you do his precepts obey &amp; commandments fulfill. wherefore decline neyther to the right nor left hand lest after that you into the gentils, wc h amongst you shall be, enter you sweare in the name of their gods, &amp; them serue &amp; adore. But cleeue to our lord god euen as you haue done here tofore vntill this day, &amp; our lord will away take in your sight your strongest foes, &amp; none shall able be wt h you to fight One of you shall pursue a thousand of your greatest enemyes because our lord hym self will fight for you as he did promise. But yf you cleeue to th'errour of these nations yt do dwell amongst you and mary &amp; ioyne amity wt h them, I fore tell you now that our lord will not them destroy, but they shall bee a pit, a snare, a stake, a stumblinge blocke before your eye, till you be taken from this excellent land, &amp; all destroyed: wherefore see that you do obserue all that god hath commanded. Behold this day into the way of all flesh I shall go, &amp; god hath all effected that he promised for to do to you, &amp; no word lefte vndone. Beyond the ryuer Iordan your fathers dwelt, &amp; he them brought to the land of chanaan He Ãgipt strooke wt h many plagues, &amp; pharao wt h hys army he in the red sea drownd, &amp; through yt made you pass wt h safty Through all the wildernesse he was your guyde, &amp; when you came to th'Amorrheits land he in the sword did make you wine ye same The kinge of Moab wt h you fought &amp; Balaam cald to curse you but god made hym to blesse you, &amp; that land he ouerthrew. All this beyond Iordan he dyd, &amp; then he brought you to this land wherein you are wc h doth wt h mylke &amp; hony flow &amp; gaue you many citties that wt h your hands were not buylded, &amp; olyue trees, &amp; vinyards that wt h your hands were not planted. Now therefore serue our lord wt h a true heart &amp; perfect mynde &amp; let hym no false gods (worke of your hands) amongst you fynde Yt's in your Choyce whether you will serue our lord who hath preserud you hitherto, or the gods in mesopotania your fathers serued or the gods of ye Amorrheits, amongst whom you now dwell But I &amp; all my house will serue our lord the god of Israell populus Israel God forbyd that we should our lord leaue, &amp; to strange gods swarue syth he hath done so much for vs. we will our lord god serue. Iosue Then witnesses you are, that you your selues our lord haue chosen for to serue hym. Pop[ulus]. witnesse. Ios[ue]. Your pact twixt god &amp; you now's writen in this same volume: &amp; for you this stone shall be a testimony that yt hath heard all that our lord hath spoken to you by mee. lest perhaps you hereafter shall lye &amp; deny the same vnto our lord wc h I haue sayd vnto you in hys name. And so I bid you all farewell, for neuer more here after shall I before you go. after my death my words remember Nuntius Iosue the sonne of Nun gods seruant now ys dead &amp; buryed when he vnto the yeares was come of ten aboue a hundred &amp; his corps ys interd in his possession in Thamnasare And dead &amp; buryed also ys in Gabatha Eleazar &amp; Iosephs bones wc h th'Israelits wt h them from Ãgipt caryed in Sichem buryed are, as at his death he had commanded.
