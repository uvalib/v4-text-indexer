      <field name="fulltext">Nec minimum mervere decus vestigia Græca Ansi deserere, &amp; celebrare domestica Facta. Hor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">TO The Right Honourable CHARLES Lord Halifax.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Prologue. Written by a Friend, and spoke by Mr. Betterton. The Town, and Fortune are too well agreed; With them the Impudent alone succeed; The forward pushing Spark in Plenty lives, By Farce he fattens, and by Nonsense Thrives While those whom Faction, nor Cabal support May starve by Sense, and thank their Judgment for't. Your common Road, we begg you'l leave to Night And in your constant Change once deviate into Right. A modest Poet is a Thing so rare. Th'unfashionable Fool you still shou'd spare. A moral story, he with Pains, has wrought With Care corrected, and improv'd by Thought, And giv'n you, what you seldom see, a Plot. So ill our Poets have the Patriot shown That they have sung all Countries but their own, Old and new Greece, France, Italy, and Spain; Nay distant China, and remote Japan. In sooty Afric too, they've Hero's found; Afric for other Monsters still renown'd Our Bards, with Heroes too have made abound. Each barbarous Corner of the Earth they've sought And fron each barbarous Corner Heroes brought. From India tawny Braves, and Blacks from Guinny; Secure with forraign Baubles still to Win ye. Our Vent'rous Poet makes a bold Essay To show Domestic Virtue here to day, And draw a generous Nation in a Play. The Minor-Wits whose Malice never fails May damn his Play because he sings of Wales. The World of old has of her Heroes rung Nor shou'd you slight the Race from whence you sprung. For Virtue sure we need not flie to Rome, Or Greece for Beauty, who have more at home. These Glorious Theams shou'd be our Poets Care, 'Twou'd warm the Gallant more, and move the Fair If viewing ours they foun'd your Pictures there.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Scene, Bayonne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Inside of a Magnificent Temple the whole Extent of the Stage: at the farther End of which a stately Altar, on it the Statue of Mercury: beneath that, a Couch. The Curtain rises with terrible Claps of Thunder, and Guinoenda is discover'd sitting in a melancholly Posture, and on each side Priestesses comforting her; on the Front of the Stage Dumnacus, and a Druid. Dumn. Come, come, no more I say, it is not fit That you, whom Learning, Years and Wisdom make The Deity almost of Bayonne, nay of Gaul, Shou'd be a Novice still; at the proud Beck Of others, far less worthy than your self. Subjection is a Burthen at the best, Ev'n to one Nobler, Greater, than ones self: But to the Draff of Men, to doating Folly, Is what a Man of Spirit ne're will bear. Druid. O Dumnacus! O Majesty of Andes! You know, that our supream Druid Is Uncle to the King, your Son in Law. Dumn. True; and I know farther, That when they fear'd thy Merit at th'Election, Wou'd bear it from all Candidates; they basely Scatter'd their Bribes, urg'd the King's Will, and so Depriv'd thee of thy Right, Supream Command In things Divine; the Empire of our Souls. Druid. What can I do, but silently submit To wrongs, I've not the power to Revenge? Dum. Oh! you mistake—you have it in your pow'r; The King by foolish pride of Empire blind; First Injures, and then trusts you with the means To punish his Injustice. Druid. Speak the way, And by yon Altar, nay by its auful God! I will this moment catch the bright occasion, And venture all to do it. Dum. Spoke like your self; Thou know'st, O! Druid! that I've been a King! Oh! Hell! to think I've been, but am no more! King of the Andes, and the Romans Terrour, The chosen Head of all confederate Gaul. Druid. To me you still shall be a King. Dum. Oh! no! Fortune has chose another Darling now; For Julius Cæsar drives me from my Throne, And with unweary'd malice hunts my Life. Hither I fled to shelter me from Fortune; For Bayonne, this small petty Kingdom's all, Of wretched Gaul, that now remains Unconquer'd: And here I hop'd, because my Daughter's Queen, I might be safe from all the Bolts of Fortune. But mark, O Druid! mark th'Ingrateful King; Who, when he fought beneath my Banner, su'd, Beg'd, and Implor'd my Daughter for his Wife; Now slights, contemns, and throws her Beauties from him, As a loath'd food of which he h'd ta'ne a surfeit. Druid. I know the Cause—the Queen of Cambria! See yonder, where she sits all drown'd in Tears: Dum. Oh! that those Tears, were Blood! yes for that Vagrant That cursed Woman! The faithless King devotes us all to Ruin! But yet, my Druid, Fate points out a way To make us happy; nay to make thee happy. Dru. Impossible! for I can ne're be happy Whilst on another's Brow I See the Wreaths, The sacred Misletoe, and not on mine. Dum. To that I come—our Woes and Happiness Are closely joyn'd, inseperably close. Know then,—the People by Opression rous'd, And touch'd with mine, and with my Daughter's Sufferings Arm all this Morning, to depose the King, Who hastens home from his Victorious Army; Proud of the trifling Spoils h'has won from Rome, With a thin Guard, impatient to this Temple, To see his Minion, fled for Refuge hither. The Druid too his Uncle, who protects her, Is now gone out to meet him. Dru. I know it well; For in the dark I left his servile Band To meet you here, according to your Summons. Dum. To you the foolish King confides her Children; Deliver them to us, and your Reward. Is the bright Dignity you only merit, You punish thus the King; oblige the Queen, Who soon will be Disposer of the Fate Of Bayonne. Dru. Ha! Sir—What? betray my Trust? Dum. The foolish Trust of thy inveterate Foe. Dru. What in the Sight of Hermes? Gaul's great God? Dum. That God to whom Chief Druid thou shalt be, As he's the Chief of all the Gods to Gaul. Dru. Does not this horrid Night forbid this Guilt? Dum. Art thou, whose Function consecrates the Night To Vows, and Sacrifice, affraid of Darkness? Dru. The Terrors of this Night make Nature start As 'twere a Warning to its Dissolution. A Fiery Deluge over-flows the Skie, And every Horrid Burst of Thunder shakes The firm Foundation of this sacred Dome. A Pile erected by the Gods themselves, And Hermes trembles at the dreadful Shock. The holy Tapers wink, while Floods of Fire Roll thro the Ples a rapid, blasting Light: Then, in a dusky Gloom, all's lost again. Dum. A Common fit of Sickness in the Elements, Natural, as Snow, or Frosts in Winter seasons. Druid. Oh! as I coasted the insulted shoar, A thousand hideous Portents cross'd the road. Fantastic Armies here, as routed fled, And from the beetling Cliffs plung'd in the Flood; There rising Billows overlook'd the Shoar, And held th'impending Deluge in the Air, 'Till, with a dismal Roar they bounded back, As 'twere to take a yet more fierce Career, Yet still unable to o'releap the Fence, Foaming, and furious at the fatal Check, They dash'd a Ship to pieces on the Rocks; I heard the horrid Crash, and then the Cries, And lamentable Groans of drowning Men. Dum. Dreams, Dreams, of Fear, come come, they kill your hopes The King comes home, on all the Wings of Love, And then takes from you the dear Means of Vengeance And of thy Purple Grandeur. Dru. Ha! That thought still fires, and alarms my Soul! Come with me strait; they're yours, Since ther's no other Way to all my Hopes! Yet I cou'd wish th'Hibernian King, whose Love Surpriz'd, and forc'd her from the Cambrian Coast Had bore her far from hence, for then I had been wretched, but I'd not been guilty. [Exeunt ambo. Guinoenda rises and comes forward. 1. Priest. Learn, learn the Lot of mortal State, Misfortunes, In fatal Circles, roll about the World; Now fall on these, then bound to other Heads, Encompass'd with the gaudy Round of Pow'r, And dash their brittle Happiness to pieces. Guin. I, I, alas! am a sad Proof of that! O! Guinoenda! Wretched without equal! Alas! you know not what it is I've lost! I've lost!—Ah! what indeed have I not lost! My, Crown, my Country, Children, and my King. 2. Priest. Let not your present Fortune thus oppress you. Guin. Lately, how lately! all Men, hail'd me Happy! Queen of the noblest Nation of the World; Wife to the greatest Hero of that Nation; And Mother to a Race of Demi-Gods! O! Cambria! Cambria! wou'd you see your Queen? O! Rhesus! Rhesus! wou'd you see your Wife? Behold her now a wretched Slave in Bayonne! Her Happiness, all vanish'd like a Dream! Behold her now, to whom no Wretch e're sought For help in vain, seeking in vain Relief Against th'Assaults of Hate, and lawless Love! Behold her now alas! no more a Queen! But a depending Prey to hopes, and Fears! Ah! no—to wild Despair, for hopes I've none! 1. Priest. Be comforted—nor throw off friendly Hope, Since from the greatest Woe, the greatest Joy may rise; Guin. There is no Joy, no Joy alas! for me! The King, when present haunts me with his Love, His odious Love. And in his absence the mistaken Queen Pursues we with her Hate. This is my sad variety of Woe! Now he returns, with Conquest o'r his Foes. That Fear remov'd, he Impiously may slight The holy Terrors of this Sanctuary. 2. Priest. Your Fears still form your Dangers much to great. Guin. Oh! that I'd perish'd in that dismal Storm, That drove me Shipwrack'd on this fatal Coast! Why was I sav'd to ruin my Preserver! The Queen, that took me, with m'expiring Children, From out the Waves, by me alas! is ruin'd! O! racking thought! ev'n but to seem ingrateful! Oh! Agony of Soul! 1. Priest. Why shou'd you thus against your self make War? For what you did not, what you cannot help? The King 'tis true pursues you with his Love, And for your sake deserts the hapless Queen; You sooth not his Desires: Nor can You help it. 2. Priest. Why are you here? within these sacred Walls? But to avoid his Love? Why have you chose That bleak hard Lodging ne're the Holy Altar? But that you might not by the lawless King Be forc'd to injure her, that once preserv'd you? What can you more to satisfie your Virtue? Or to prevent th'unhappy Queens Misfortune? Guin. Yet she pursues mine, and my Childrens Lives: And has this Night, with furious Threats, twice summon'd Me to leave this Temple. 1. Priest. Let her rage on, she cannot reach you here; And hence our Druid charges, that you stir not 'Till he arrive: and he will soon be here. Guin. That is some Comfort: for I fain wou'd Live To see the dear Remains of all my little Tribe Safe in their Fathers Arms; in his protecting Arms. Yes I wou'd fain,—but oh! that wo'not be!— The cruel fates deny me that, fain I wou'd Behold my Rhesus e're I die. [She weeps. 1. Priest. Talk not dying; the Gods will only trie you. Guin. Yes, yes ye Matrons I must die; I feel A sad foreboding in my Soul, that says Thy fate O! Guinoenda! now approaches! I feel, I feel the angry hand of Heav'n! My guilty Fathers Punishments reach me! They shake with horror all my trembling Frame. 1. Priest. What fears tormented fancy can awake! Guin. O! Princes! learn to be your Peoples Fathers! Let not Ambition make you slight the Laws! For such the Gods pursue with large Destruction; Sweep from the Earth their whole unhappy Race! The guiltless, with the guilty fall, in one sad Ruin. 2. Priest. Whither her fears, and Miseries transport her? Guin. Yet O! ye Gods! if I must share the Fate [kneels. Of my unhappy house, If my Innocence and virtue can't appease you, Nor all the mighty Woes I've suffer'd! For all the Vows, and Pray'rs I've sent up to you If I must die, Oh! let me first behold My Rhesus, my dear Husband! that his hands May close my Eyes, which last of all on him May press their sickly Beams behold his Tears, A flood of Tears flow from his melting eyes; And feel their pleasing Fall upon my Face. For he wou'd weep to see me die; wou'd feel Each Pang of mine, wou'd suffer all my Pains; Be tortur'd with my Agonys, and die Almost with me! for tho' in Battle fierce And dauntless as the God of War in danger; Yet is he soft, and tender in his Love, As Woman, in her first, and Virgin fires. Full of compassion, and unweary'd Truth; The best of Husbands, Friends, of Kings, and Fathers. O! sad Remembrance of what once I had, But ne'r must have again! O fate! O fortune! 2. Priest. Madam the Queen. 1. Priest. Be mistress of your temper. Guin. Alas! I pitty her! yes from my Soul, I pitty her! 'Tis sad enough to see her Father driv'n To a dependance on the man, that slights her, But then to love, and loose the Man she loves, By his unkindness loose him, Oh! 'tis a Torture, That none but those, that love like us can tell. Enter Queen attended. Messenger to the Queen, as she enters. Madam King Dumnacus your royal father, Sends me to let you know he now has got The British Children; and he bids you hast, Since both the King, and Druid will be here, Within an hour, or two, his Spys assure him. Queen. Enough—return with speed, and tell my Father He may proceed with them, as he design'd; Their Mother soon I shall prepare to meet them. [Exit. The Queen goes up to Guinoenda. How long must I command my Slave in vain? What you disdain Obedience to Me now.— Since the curs'd Dotage of my faithless King You proudly swell above your humble Lot, But we shall see thy fond Ambition burst thee, While it contends with Majesty like mine. Guin. Far be Contention, Madam, between us! Our common Sorrows, shou'd alas! unite us. I doubly feel the Pain, for which you grieve, Both from my Gratitude, and the sad Cause Of all your Woe. Queen. Yes, yes, thou hast rewarded, My foolish Pity, thou hast well rewarded, That took (Oh! Curses on the hour I did it!) That took thee, Ship-wreck'd, up with thy two Children, Half drown'd, half dead; comforted, warm'd, reviv'd you; Cherish'd you in my Bosom, as my own. When like th'ingrateful Serpent, brought to Life, Thou fly'st at thy Preserver; pois'ns her Peace, And spreads thy subtle venome o're her Joys.— By Witcheries, and black, sinister Arts, Thou did'st seduce my faithless Husbands Heart, For by nought else cou'dst thou delude him from me, From Eyes more bright, and powerful, than thine; From the illustrious Bed of Andes Daughter, To the inglorious feet of a poor Vagabond. But with a just Revenge I come to punish Ingratitude of such a Monstrous Growth, Nor shall this Temple, or its God protect thee. Guin. That God be Witness, how your suffrings pain me! How much unhappy your Misfortunes make me! Oh! as I merit not this unjust Rage, So is it needless to compleat my Woe, For without that, I am entirely wretched! I wou'd be silent therefore, if I durst; But that my silence wou'd confess a Guilt From which I'm free, for well your self you know, That on the Kings first falshood, I fled hither: Here have remaind e'r since, in hopes of Succour From the great Gods, if Man deny'd me help. Queen. Yes, yes, I know you fled But Fear of me, not of his Love, Compell'd thy guilty flight into this Temple. But I will drive thee hence—I will—nor think With fawning speeches to appease my Rage, Those take with vulgar Minds, but with a Soul, Like mine sublime, they but provoke. Tune then no more thy Syrens Voice to sooth me, With soft'ning Words, while yet I feel thy Deeds Thy hellish Sorceries, and my King enstrang'd. Guin. Condemn'd thus blindly, by your partial hate. I must acquit my self, and boldly tell you, 'Tis to your self you owe your loss, not me. The Insolence of your uneasie Pride, Your dayly Boasts of your paternal Grandeur, With your Contempt of his; your hourly Contests Have made his heart grow weary of your Sway. And catch the least Appearance of more ease. If you'd regain it, you must teach your Tongue The humble Arts of a fond, tender Wife; Banish your Pride, assume a pleasing Temper, These are the Philtres to preserve a Heart; When froward Beauty but disgusts the wise, Not Form, but Virtue makes a lasting Love. Qu. Am I then guilty, and you innocent? Guin. Who persecute the Innocent, are guilty. Qu. Who will be guilty by their own Confession? But you grow Insolent in bold Replies, My Justice soon shall cool you. Guin. Too much, too much you threaten. Qu. You threaten not, but act. Guin. I act by Reason, Justice, and Religion. Qu. Your Cambrian Notions are no Rules to us. Guin. Base things, in every Climate are the same. Qu. You may talk on, but you shall surely Die. Guin. See you not Hermes my Protector yonder? Qu. I come to make you quit his stoln Protection. Guin. You never shall. Qu. Believe not that, thy Death Is sixt, as fate, before the King's Return. Guin. I will not quit this holy Temple. Qu. With Flames I'll then surround thy cursed Body. Guin. Light thou the impious flame, the God's my safe-guard. Qu. Ten thousand Wounds shall pierce thy guilty Heart. Guin. Here kill me then, that the polluted Temple Provoke the Vengeance of the God's upon thee. Qu. Injurious Pow'rs to guard the guilty thus! Guin. Accuse not them, they guard, in me, thy Safety. Qu. No, no, the King at Distance views thee now; Else he wou'd throw thee from him, like a Weed, That his mistaking Eye had made him crop, Gay to the sight, but to the Smell most loathsome, Yet least thy cunning Arts still keep him off From that Discovery, 'till I am ruin'd, I now will root thee up my self. Guin. Never, never. Queen. Is then my Pow'r contemn'd? sit basely here, And let thy Children, suffer in thy Place, Guin. My Children! Queen. Yes, stay here, and let them die. Guin. O! Queen! how have they injur'd you? Queen. In thee! Guin. Is there no medium betwixt these sad Extreams? Queen. None. Guin. What is my Guilt? Queen. Wronging me. Guin. Oh! that's my Fortunes Guilt, and none of mine. Queen. Thy fortune I cannot punish; I can thee. I owe my Miseries to thee alone; And thou alone canst end my Miseries. My Father, watchful for his Daughters Safety At length, has got thy hateful Off-spring; And will by them remove the fatal Cause Of both our growing Woes. Guin. Have I not sent To Britain the sad story of my Fortune? If Rhesus live, he'l soon flie to my Rescue. (Good God's Preserve him from this dreadful Storm!) If he be dead, I die without your Crime. Queen. No more of thy vain Boasts, that trick is old, Nor trust to thy imaginary Pow'r. I can believe no more, Oh! that I never had! I heard thy Story, thought the fiction real: Thought thee a Queen, torn from thy King, and Country By a base Ravisher, this I believ'd; And pittied thy sad Case. I knew what 'twas to wear a Crown, and saw What 'twas to loose it, in my Father. But thy Ingratitude has wak'd me now From these vain Day-dreams. Therefore no more; Or quit this awful Temple, Or stay, and let thy Children suffering Racks; Expire in Tortures, for thy Crimes, not theirs. Guin. Wait but one Day. Queen. What you wou'd have me wait The swift return of my injurious Husband. You in his coming place your surest hope! But I'll prevent that, and this Minute go.— Guin. Oh! stay! stay but one hour; I do conjure you, kneels &amp; takes hold of her. By all your hopes! by your Desires! who knows What strange Events one hour may produce. Queen. No more, in vain, in vain you strive to move me. Guin. Stay but One Moment, that I may but think. Queen. Away, and touch me not, least I profane The Temple, and ev'n here transfix thy heart. The Gods thy Guard.—Yet shou'd he fence thee round With sulph'rous flames, and Moats of boyling Lead; I'll send a summons, e're the King return, As near as thy vain hopes believe him, shall Make thee with rapid fury fly thro' All, Fly this Protection, and my Victim fall. [breaks from her and exits. Guin. O! Queen! Oh! hear me! hear me speak! Ha! she is gone to murder my poor Children! Oh! let me fly with speed to save their Lives! Enter Voelia. Voel. O! Madam! Oh! most sad, most dismal Sight! I scarce can speak it, or believe my Eyes. Guin. Ha! speak quickly, least my fears destroy me. Voel. The barbarous Dumnacus, has got your Children, Has bound them, and has vow'd their Death, Immediate Death, if not by you prevented. Guin. Oh! bear me swiftly to him least my fears For their dear lives, shou'd rob them of their Ransom. 1. Priest. Trust not his Word; he may when you have left This Place of safety, kill both you, and them. Guin. If they must die, oh! let not me survive them! What have I left in Life, when they are gone, My utmost Hope! to justifie my living: No I were poor of Soul indeed, to buy A loathsom Life with their inhumane Suff'rings. What let the poor dear Innocents, for me, Endure the Rack! for me in Torture, die! Stand off—away—methinks I hear em cry! Oh! to their Rescue let me swiftly fly For in their Fate ten thousand Deaths I die. The End of the first Act.</field>

The Grove before the Temple, near the front of the Stage, the Altar or Urn Pluto; on one side enter Dumnacus, Guards and Attendants; conducting in Tyrelius, and Manselia bound, on the other side enter Guinoenda, Voelia, and Attendants. Guino. speaks Entring. I've left the Temple, and am in your Pow'r: With me do what you will, but save their Lives: To give them second Life, I yield my own. Oh! my poor Children! [Embracing them. Seeing the Children she runs to them, and they to her, and the Girle presses close under her arm. Guin. Oh! my cruel Fortune! Whose sad Contagion spreads to all that's mine! O! Gods! oh! will you never be appeas'd! Dum. Seize and bind her. As they bind her she speaks to her Children. Guin. If you live, my Children, Remember me, amid'st what Ills I perish! And when you see your father Embrace his Neck, and with a Flood of Tears! Tell him what I have done to ransome you. Dum. No more of this, but listen to your Doom. 'Twas but a Bait, to draw you from the Temple, When we propos'd to save your Childrens Lives; For by the Root I must cut up this Bramble, That choaks my Daughters Path to Happiness. Guin. Alas! then I'm betray'd! basely betray'd. Dum. You are indeed, I own the useful Cheat. Guin. But is this just? Dum. Revenge of Wrongs is just. Guin. Think you there are no Gods to punish you? Dum. Let Time prove that, you first at least shall die. Guin. But will you murder too these Innocents? Dum. Your Fate involves them, 'cause they're yours they die. Guin. Oh! my Children! oh! how shall I deplore you? Yet if the Lust of Mischief blind you not, Consider for your own, and Daughters sake, What 'tis you do; the King this hour returns, Who, with severest Vengance, will destroy The bloody actors in these horrid Murders. Dum. Murder? to offer thee? a slave and guilty? To the great Gods, in pious Sacrifice? We offer Thousands better every Day, Besides in this I serve him;— Redeem his Fame, rescue him from Infamy. And when the Witchcraft of thy Charms is gone, He'll own it, and reward the daring Love, That boldly snatch'd th'enchanted Cup away. That wou'd have sunk his Godlike Form to brutal. Guin. Let me then die alone; 'tis Wantonness Of Cruelty, to kill these too? Dum. To spare one Foe, that may be slain, is Folly: For that one spar'd, too late, we may wish dead; And from a small unheeded Spark may rise A Fire, that may destroy us All. Guin. Oh! Mournful Pomp of Fate! oh! My dear Children! You soon, within the peaceful Grave, shall lye, Togather, on your wretched Mother's Bosom. Tyrel. Revenge like this is worthy such a King On helpless Woman, and defenceless Children! Thy Soul is fal'n even to ev'n lower, than thy Fortune. Dum. So hot young Sir, 'tis fit to cool you then. Guin. Kneel both, and, as you may, take hold of him; And press his knees, and force his heart to pitty. Mans. O! dear Sir, spare spare my life. Guin. Ah! Let my life, my life suffice, 'tis I, 'Tis I, have injur'd you, if any has. Who rob'd your Daughter of her Husbands Heart? 'Twas I, who then shou'd suffer for it? Only I. Mans. Oh! Sir Spare me! Tyr. Sister, no more Laments, but for our Mother Let us both begg, Yes I will begg for her. [kneels. Look on me, Sir, I ne'r was taught to sue, Sprung from a King, and nurst up in Command, Yet for her sake; for my dear Mothers sake, Ill begg, and weep— Or any thing to gain her Life. Ah! spare her! Spare my Mother! Kneel all, and begg her Life! [All kneel Guin. Begg not for mine but theirs. Ah! Spare my Children! Tyr. Ah! Spare my Mother! Voel. Ah! spare them all, we all implore your Mercy, For her, and for her Children t'abstain from Ill, When in your Power's indeed to be a King. Dum. Why do you throw your selves about my feet? Besige me round, with all your bootless Weepings? Your Tears, and Pray'rs are like the Winds, and Waves, That blow, and dash in vain against the Rocks, Unmov'd I stand; and unrelenting fixt, In what I have resolv'd. Tyr. rising Kill not my Mother if you wou'd spare me; For this be sure I will revenge her Death. Guin. Ah! mind not him, or else, at least forgive His pious Anger, which you shou'd admire. I've been a Queen, out-liv'd my Happiness, And Death to me wou'd be most welcome, A wretched slave, the object of her hate, Who sav'd my Life, and what's a greater Evil, The Object of his Love, whom must I hate, As the detested Foe to Honour— Tyr. You seem a Man make not on Women War, A tender Woman and a puling Girle. Are not just Objects of a manly Anger. If you want vengeance, turn your self to me, For killing me, you kill a Man, a Foe, A sure Revenger of his Mothers Wrongs. My Father meant, that I shou'd be a Soldier, And from the Cradle train'd me up to Glory. Young as I am, I've seen a thousand die. 'Tis but a strugling Gasp, and all is quiet, And can I then fear Death, in such a Cause? Guin. O! Dumnacus! cannot such virtue move thee? Tyr. Oh! that I now were free from these vile Bands! But you did well to bind me thus;— For thou wou'dst tremble, were my Hands but free, Nor dare let fall our Doom, from thy base faultring Tongue For sure the Guilty must be always Cowards! Mansel. Ah! Brother dont provoke him! Oh! Sir! Tyr. Sue not to him; why shou'd the Blood of Rhesus Sue to a banish'd wretch, to be rejected! Let me provoke thee Traytor— I scorn thy Pitty, and contemn thy Mercy! All Obligations to the base are odious, But to owe Life to one so base, as thee My soul disdains; no give me speedy Death, There's an Antipathy betwixt us two, So great, I start at farther Converse with thee. Guin. Ah! speak him fair, my Boy, he may relent, He h's known Distress, shou'd therefore know Compassion. Tyr. Madam believe it not, base Minds, like his, Ne're feel Compassion; the brave alone feel that. Butcher dispatch, I'm weary of this waiting, For Life's offensive, while it shews me thee. Dum. Dispatch him first; the Boy's in hast it seems This froathy Buble shall be quickly broken. Guin. Oh! spare my Son! spare my dear darling Boy! His Fathers Image both in Form and Virtue! And for his sake, for his dear Life preserv'd Rhesus if yet he live, will give you Ransom: An ample Ransom; perhaps, forgive my Death. Dum. Woman, no more; I have delay'd too long, Amus'd by your curs'd Arts. Dispatch 'em strait. I else may loose my Prey.—dispatch I say— Death! how slowly do the Villans move? What have you all forgotten to obey? Or has this Woman brib'd you to her Rescue? Guin. rising. O! ye false Gauls ye Enemies to all men! Deceitful, crafty, cunning—little Arts Mean Counsels are your Study— Open fair dealing, as a Crime, ye abhor, But serpentine in kind, your false Designs You roll, in subtle Volumes from our Eyes. By Perjury you thrive, by Treachery grow. Oh! may you perish all, ye guilty Nation! Yes Rome will soon revenge me, and sweep you From off the Earth, ye Rubbish of the World! Dum. No more—your Rage is vainer, than your Pray'rs. I say dispatch 'em slaves! or I shall drive you. As they lead them to the Altar of Pluto the chief Druid of Mercury enters attended by a Troop of Druids in their habits, with holy Banners flying, and Trophies. Chief Druid speak entring. Hold! I command you hold!—flie you before— My aged Limbs too slowly bear me on To their Relief. Now by the sacred Powers, What means this face of Murder? What these Bands? Who has prophan'd the Sanctuary of Hermes? And forc'd her from the awful God I serve, Whom he vouchsaf'd to shelter? tell me, that, As our blest Gallic Laws decree, I may Pronounce him curs'd; cut off from all the Rights Of humane-kind, and Commerce with the Gods. Shew me I say the giulty Wretch.— Guin. O reverend Druid! welcome to th'unhappy, As the kind God whose Minister you are! Like him you come to succour the distress'd! You come to her who had no hope on Earth. They dragg me, as you see, with my poor Children, From Mercury to offer us to Pluto! Not for Devotion to th'infernal God But to revenge imaginary Wrongs They make m'unhappyness, alas! my Crime, And wou'd destroy us all, because I'm wretched! [Weeps. Druid. What fraud, or Force has drawn you from the Temple? Guin. The Force they us'd was only on the Mind, Yet such as no fond Mother cou'd resist. To save my Children I my self surrender'd, But oh! in vain! for now they kill us all. O! Venerable Sir, behold I kneel I wou'd extend my hands, t'implore your Aid, But those alas! are bound! help or we perish! Basely for you, but wretchedly for us. Druid. Hast, and unbind them. Dum. Touch 'em not, they're mine, By Right are mine. Druid. By Right? what Right? unbind 'em Dum. Forbear— They are my Daughters—for, a worthless Wreck From gloomy Dis she snatch'd them, but will now Restore his ravish'd Victims. Druid. Prophane Impostor! To make Religion Pandar to thy Vengeance But all's the Kings, as his I will preserve them. Dum. If they are his they're mine, as mine are his All things are common, Sir, betwixt true Friends. Druid. T'assist, but not destroy. Dum. You sha'not bear 'em off. Druid. Forbear to touch 'em, as you love your Life. Dum. No more, no more Old Man; I shall be angry. Druid. Angry!—now, by the Temples injur'd Honour. What boots thy Anger? what shou'd make Me fear it? Be angry at Rome; angry at thy self, That did so ill defend thy native Kingdom Aginst her Force. Think who, and where you are: The wandring Reliques of a beaten Prince; And in an others Court, not in your own, That Lord it thus o're us, and all our Laws. We're not the Andes, nor art thou King, Who basely woud'st pollute with horrid Murders Th'Asylum, that protects thee from Destruction; That guards thy destin'd and inglorious Head. Dum. Dotard no more—thou feeble Railer peace. Thy Age protects thee from my Rage; no more Least I unman my self to punish thee. Druid. Nay threat not me, Can'st thou rage here, who live but by our folly? Else we shou'd soon give up thy hunted Life To Cæsar, that demands it. For thou it was, Engag'd the Gauls first to fall out with Rome; Rang'd her confederate Pow'rs beneath thy Banner And then fled from 'em—taught them all to flie; And sunk the Pow'r, and Liberty of Gaul, Oh! that we still shou'd for so vile a Cause Thus sacrifice our lives and fortunes! Who for that War thy own Ambition rais'd Alone without one Wound, or Scratch art come. Dum. Trust not too much to that thy awful Robe, Or thy securer Age; those pompous Ramparts My Fury will o'er-bear—away I say— Druid. Thy Threats I smile at—thus you shou'd have threatned When Cauinius aw'd thee, with his harrass'd Army; Or when Duracius, coop'd up in a Town, Despis'd thy Fury, laugh'd thee from his Walls. Death! why were not you angry too, when Fabius With a small Party made thee fly before him? Then with a Handful drove thee from the Field. Oh! Scandal to the Gallic Name, and Glory! Thy Anger's safer here against a Woman, And two small Children. They're more worthy Dumnacus! Dum. Oh! foolish Pow'r giv'n by th'unthinking People To the imposing Priest-hood! That consecrates Abuse, forbids Revenge, For contumelious Wrongs, like these!—no more— I shall forget the formal Duties paid thee, Rush on thy sapless wither'd Trunk, and crush thee. Druid. Ha! vile Blasphemer! dare but to approach me, And thou shalt find this sapless Trunk has Force Enough to quel th'impious— I'll be a Roman to thee. Dum. Gods! must I tamely bear these proud Insults puts his hand to his Sword. Capt. of the Guards interposing My Lord. Let not your Anger drive you to your Ruin; You know his Person sacred, by his Function: Religion binds us all to rescue him. Druid. Oh! let him come—give his Fury way— 'Tis harmless all— The Gods beheld thy impious thoughts of them, And therefore took again the Crown, they gave thee. Begon I say, ye sacrilegious Race. Begon from Bayonne; with thy Daughter go— Go any whither—go, and fight the Romans In thy own Ignominious Quarrel— Not while my King, and Nephew, thy Defender Is for thy Safty combating with Rome, Disturb his house, and murder those he loves. Ingratitude makes up thy Guilt—begone— I shut thee from the Gods, for thy Impieties. Thou worst of Men, and wicked, as thou'rt wretched. Capt. He's old, my Lord, and Age has Priveledge Of Anger; you'd better, Sir, withdraw. Dum. Well I'll be calm; he shannot now provoke me. By Blood allied, you shou'd have join'd my Cause And freed your house, from this prevailing Mischief, But since you have no thought at all of that, I shall acquaint the Queen, my Daughter, who It is, resists her Orders. Druid. Do; and tell her this— I will do Justice; and protect th'oppress'd Defend the Rights of the affronted Gods Against both Queen and King, if they assault them. Why else am I invested with this Pow'r? With this most holy Robe, and sacred Office? Which I by slavish Flat'ry won't betray, Unbind 'em strait, or I'll exclude you all From the Communion of our Sacrifices.— Stand off; I will my self unbind the Queen. Ha! did you think you'd bound an Ox, or Lion? Or didst thou fear she'd grasp a Sword, and kill thee? Thou'st bound her, as if she were a Roman! Dum. Oh! Patience! Patience, that the Bigotry Of a blind People to their haughty Priests Shou'd wrest my Vengance from me— [Exit cum suis. Guin. O! Venerable Druid! may the Gods Reward your Piety, and Goodness— Protect us still from the too furious Queen. Druid. Be not affraid, but boldly to the Temple The King by this must be arriv'd, but fear not All will assist, when my just Right's invaded. And I my self will head the pious Band I'm not so old but I can still command Courage, and Heav'n no Rebel dare withstand. Tyr. Madam, no Danger fear, now I am free, I'll get a Sword, and then your Guard I'll be; For to reach you, they first shall pass thro' me. Let not my Youth your Confidence destroy The Gauls must find a Terror, in a British Boy. [Exeunt Omnes. The End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Inside of the Temple. Enter Rhesus just escap'd the Wreck. Rhe. O Hermes! for thine, I see this Temple is How well have I invok'd thy powerful name! When in the stormy flood I strove for life. And with the Billows made unequal War; Thou gav'st my Arms fresh force, and thou at last Hast thus deliver'd Rhesus from destruction. Oh! that thy pittying Goodness had preserv'd My Friends, that in their Monarchs Cause forsook The blest Retreats of Cambria, for the Toyls, And various hazards of th'inclement Deep; For never Monarch had such Friends, such Subjects! [Kneels] O! Hermes! if so the heav'nly Pow'rs decree, That I no more must breath the British Air; Oh! grant at least the Cause of my long Voyage! Oh! grant my Guinoenda to my Arms! Enter Guinoeda her Children and Voelia. Guin. Blest be the Gods! we've reach'd this sanctuary Let us return our thanks, perhaps the Gods May once restore us to your Father! O! Rhesus! Rhesus! wou'd that thou wer't come! Oh! how desir'd woud'st thou come to me! Rhesus hearing her starts up, and comes toward her. Rhes. O! all ye Gods! what well known sounds I hear! Guin Ha! By the pale Beams the dying Tapers throw, Methinks I see a Man moving this way. Hast nearer to the Altar, till the Druid, And all the holy Tribe, return from Court, Some Engine of the disappointed Queen. Rhes. Stay, do not flie me! stay, bright Vision, stay! For, by this glim'ring light, I now discover A Form, that both amazes, and delights me. Guin. O! Matrons! friends! flie to my speedy Rescue. Rhes. You need no rescue, for I am no Ravisher, Fear not; but tell me, who thou art, whose face, Whose Voice, whose Person, so surprize with Wonder? Guin Ha! that Voice I'm sure's no Strangers. No— And now I view thee well, I see my Rhesus! O! Rhesus! Rhesus! for it must be thee! Rhes Ah! well you know the sad Remains of Rhesus! Guin. Oh! late arriv'd to thy desiring Wife! Rhes. Thou art my Guinoenda then? Guin. 'Tis I indeed, it is your Guinoenda! Rhes. 'Tis she! 'tis she! it is my Guinoenda! O! my life! my Soul! [Embrace. Guin O! my love! my All! Rhes. Oh I have so much to say, I know not how, or where I shall begin! I have a thousand things to ask and tell! Guin. Beyond belief! almost beyond my Hopes, I clasp my Rhesus! [Embrace. Rhes. As I do thee, when I most fear'd I'd lost thee! Guin. See, see, thy little Off-spring too have caught Our spreading Joy! see how they wait t'embrace you! Tyrel. My Father! Man. My dear; dear Father! Rhes. My Children! [they all embrace him. Guin. My King! Rhes. My Queen! let me embrace you all! Embraces them one after another. O! indulgent heav'n! O thrice happy Shipwreck! That cast me on my only hopes away! O! my, dear Love, come tell me all thy fortune, Where art thou? and how come hither? Guin. Ask not, the dismal Story of our parting; Th'unlucky Omen pains, and shocks my Soul. Rhes. 'Tis but the Superstition of thy Love. Guin. I will obey you.— When down the silver Tovy. I was row'd, As you well-know, to take the Ev'ning Air; My Women, and these Children only with me; The base Hibernian King, that ow'd his Life, And liberty to your victorious Sword Seiz'd on our Barge, and forc'd us all aboar'd Hoisted his Sails, and bore away to Sea. Rhes. This I soon knew, and closely I pursu'd him. But finding him too swift with Rage return'd Set out my Fleet, and reach'd th'Hibernian Shore, Laid all his Country Wast in dire Revenge But found nor him, nor thee. Guin. While you pursu'd, uncertain of his Prey, He spoke me fair; and laid the fault on love, Unconquerable Love, and wild Despair; Implor'd my Pity of a Madman's frenzy; Seem'd to repent, and promis'd to restore me. But this alas! was the effect of Fear, For You no sooner quited your Pursuit, But his submissive Meaness swell'd to threats, Which as a vast Storm, that then arose rebated, Till on this Coast of Bayonne here we split, Where he, and all his perish'd, And I with my two Children, Were taken up half dead. And thus the Gods preserv'd me for thy Arms. Rhe. Not finding thee, thro' all th'Hibernian Coast, For that I search'd, with narrow scrutiny, Orewhelm'd with deep despair, I steer'd for Cambria. The Seas grew high, and swell'd into a storm, Dispers'd our Fleet, and dash'd my Ship to pieces, Where perish'd all the Heroes of our Country, Vanutius, Cornwallus, and Conavius, With good Morganius—only I escap'd A poor, a naked, helpless, shipwreck'd Man. Guin. Oh! welcome! howsoever thou art come! Tho'poor, and wretched, yet thou'rt rich to me. I pray'd whole Nights, and wish'd whole livelong days, To see my Love, I pray'd alas! to see thee, But little thought to see thee thus! The cruel Gods but heard my Vows by halves, They've brought thee to me, but they've brought thee wretched Divested of that Pow'r, that shou'd have freed us. And yet 'tis better far to see thee thus, Than not to see thee! yes to see thee wretched, Than not at all to see thee! pardon, my Lord, This wild excess of Love; I cannot wish You ev'n in Britain safe, to loose you ever!— Yet I cou'd die for you; indeed I cou'd! Witness O Love! and all you Heav'nly Pow'rs, How much I wish my death, wou'd save my Rhesus! For oh! my Lord, preserv'd from Seas and Battels. You come to perish here. [Weeps. Rhe. Where lies the danger? What mean these tears? what wou'd these tender sighs? What is't alarms thy Love? Guin. Fly, fly, my Lord, th'inhospitable Coast, The Tyrant of this place will surely kill thee! Enter Queen, and stands observing them. Rhe. What Cause of Hate can I a stranger give him? Guin. All Britains for your sake he dooms to death, And you, of all, he most both fears and hates, As the chief bar to his detested love. Rhe. Love? does he then attempt thy Love? Guin. He does, nay wou'd force me to— Rhe. Wou'd force? ha! What hinders him from forcing, if he wou'd? Guin. My Love, my Virtue, and this awful Temple. Qu. What's this I hear? this may import me. Guin. Yes Hermes guards me from both Love, and Hate; Nor King nor Queen durst e're assault me here. Beneath the Shadow of that holy Altar On that hard Couch I take those broken slumbers, Which Nature forces from my Pray'rs for thee! Rhes. O Guinoenda! I am doubly wretched, To see thee unhappy, and want Pow'r to help thee! Guin. Think not of me, but think upon thy self, Think of thy Safety, that concerns me more. Oh! save thy life by suddain flight! Rhes. From thee?— Guin. From me, from every thing, that wou'd destroy thee. Rhes. From Guinoenda? for whom I've fought So many Battels, and such dangers past? Guin. You must not perish with me. Rhes. I will not live without thee. Guin. Nor I, without my Rhesus, witness Heav'n! Oh! witness all ye Pow'rs, that know my heart I cannot bear to see thee die; nor can I Live without thee! Rhes. And shou'd I flie then from a Love so tender! Guin. There's such a Contradiction in my Will, I know not what to say! I wou'd not have You go, and yet, O! Gods! you must not stay, and die! There is no living with thee, nor without thee! Rhes. Love, Honor, Glory, all forbid my flight, Deserting thee, while I can grasp this Sword. Rhes. You cannot kill the Tyrant. Rhes. Is he invulnerable? Guin. Yes his Guards Will make him so to you! alas! the hazard Is much to great. Rhes. Wou'd you then have me tamely Here wait my fate, not meet it like your Rhesus? Guin. I'd have thee safe; this rash Attempt destroys thee, Time may gain all our hopes. Rhes. How? Guin. Keep your self From being known. Rhes. Who here shou'd know me? Guin. Your Country is as dangerous as your Name. Rhes. What can I do then? Guin. Let me consider. Queen. I've heard enough. Rhes. Ah! we are lost, my Rhesus, we are lost! Rhes. What new Misfortune gives you this alarm? Queen. 'Tis I, 'tis I, who have o're heard your Conference. Rhes. If you have, Madam, Beauty sure like yours Was ne'r ally'd to cruelty; Compassion Is the Womans noblest Virtue. And sure A form so bright, within too must be perfect. Qu. (Aside.) Methinks I take a Pleasure in his Praise More, than I use in vulgar Flatteries. Rhes. And Lovers in distress more justly claim Protection from the beautiful and young. You must have known, sure, what it is to love; And then our secret is secure with you. Qu. Yes I have lov'd, I once too was belov'd, Till cursed Chance brought her to blast my Joys, And spread a dismal ruin ore my Love! Rhes. Ah! we are lost indeed! th'unhappy Queen! Guin. kneeling.] Ah! madam, ah! forget my guilty fortune! Or if you will have Vengeance, take my life, But oh! spare his! escap'd both floods, and fields, Let him not perish here! to see him die, Is what a Wife so tender cannot bear. Qu. Yet I have born more for thee— The Death of Love! It had been less to see my Husband die, Than cease to love; if Rhesus die, he dies Still loving thee; while I must be forsaken; For thee despis'd; for thee thrown off, and loath'd O! Agony! O! most detested fate! How dar'st thou sue to me? Guin. Oh! let me suffer then, I'll leave this Temple, Again approach the dreadful Urn of Pluto, If you will pitty him; if you will save him. Qu. If I must pitty him, say thou no more, For such a Pleasure in thy Pains I feel I shall undo my self to ruin thee But let him speak—perhaps he may prevail. For midst my Rage I fear my heart pleads for him. [Aside. Rhes. Oh! rise my Love, my life's not worth thy tears, To beg, and fawn, for such a Boon, as life, That fortune the next Minute may take from me, Is much below the Deeds, that I have done. Yes I shou'd blush to beg that of a Woman, Which all th'Hibernian Warriours cou'd not take. To die 's no Evil, to live meanly, is A brave Man's Wish, is first of all to conquer, His next, if that's deny'd is Noble Death. Yet for my self, tho'I disdain to beg, Your safety, Madam, that depends on mine, Will sure excuse what I shall urge to move you. Let us be gone, and you remove the Cause That leads your King astray. Qu. When I can punish, to reward my Rival, With what she most desires, wou'd be strange Folly. Rhes. To punish her, you punish your self too, Kill me, you give her to the Man you love! Qu. Ah! no! I fear I give her thus to him! [aside. Rhes. Since then your woes, and happiness are join'd, 'Tis folly to be wretched, to make her so. Qu. For her you plead too much, too little for your self. Rhes. No, Madam, I never will descend So low, to sue with servile fear for life. No thou great God, I will appeal to thee! Be Witness of the Injuries we suffer; We yet are thine; be thine then our Protection! And thou, O! Pluto! I invoke thy Aid! Whom for her sake so lavishly I've feasted With Hecatombs of slaughter'd foes, Enough to bribe thy Avarice of Souls. Restore those dead, or move this beautious Queen To give the Purchase of those Slaughters to me. Why shou'd effeminate Weepings, move you more, Than speaking like a Man? If those alone Where Interest, and Reason fail, can move you; 'Tis more than life can pay: then seize the forfeit; You can no more, and my past Deeds secure me From an inglorious Fall. Queen. (Aside ... ) Strange War I feel, Within my brest since I have heard him talk Pity or Love, I know not which prevails, And drives retiring Rage from out my heart. If it be Love, as oh! I fear it is! She yet must die; but he must be preserv'd.( ... Aside.) Compassion, Sir, at last prevails; for me, [to him. Tho' injur'd, you are safe; for taught by You, I find Revenge less charming, than forgiveness, (Aside ... ) I must be gone, or I am lost; I know The fatal track of false injurious Love! ( ... Aside.) I never will betray you to the King: [to him. Nay I advise you to disguise your self To shelter you from his observing Spies; Tho none are sharper than a Rivals Eyes. [Exit looking back at him. Guin. She's discompos'd, and left us in Confusion. She eye'd thee too, as if she'd look into thee. Or I'm deceiv'd, or else we owe to Love Thy Safety. Rhes. No, no, my Love, she is convinc'd How much it is her Interest to preserve me. Escap'd this Shelf, how shall we reach our Port? Guin. I've found the way, will bear us safe to Land. Rhes. How? Guin. I will report you drown'd, and put on Mourning, Deplore your Death; pretend you brought this News, And that will gain you favour, with the King. Rhes. Suppose this done. Guin. I will preswade him our Religion binds The Wife, and Children of those drown'd at Sea, At Sea their Rites of Funeral to perform. A few hours rowing brings us into Spain A foe to Bayonne, and the Gallic Name. Rhes. But who shall row us? Guin. The holy Druids, Who all will join in my Deliverance. Rhes. It is the Child of Love, and must succeed. Guin. Retire with me, and while I dress, we may Improve the lucky thought.— For on this weighty Moment much depends If I'm discover'd Death will be my Lot, If I succeed my Country, and my Love! O! sacred Juno! Bright Partner of the Bed, of thundr'ing Jove, O! blest Protectress of Connubial Love Look with an Eye of Pity on our state! Nor let the Gods oppress us with their hate! Oh! give such Faith, as ours a milder Fate! If in this pious Fraud, a Crime there be, Oh! let your Vengeance fall alone on me! Let me; let only me your Victim prove, But Oh! preserve, preserve the Man I love. The End of the Third Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. The Grove before the Temple, Enter Dumnacus, and Queen, with Attendants. Qu. You find there is no time to loose, the King Throws off the veil, and has confess'd the Tyrant; Openly avows, now he has beat the Romans, His lawless Love, The Altar can't preserve its Votaries From the outragious Fury of his Lust. Ev'n now, in view of this auspicious Temple, He stab'd the Druid, that gave up the Children Of that vile, foreign Vagrant to us, Nor stops he there, but thinks 'tis not enough To slight, for her, my Charms, and therefore now Resolves my Death. Dum. And mine—yes—he has dar'd to threaten me too! This petty Prince has dar'd to threaten me! Me, who have aw'd him with an angry Nod Giv'n laws to Monarchs, and depending Chiefs. Me, who Rome fear'd, and every Nation courted. Me— But soon he shall perceive there yet remains A Mind undanted in these awful Ruins Conscious of Greatness, and my ancient Glory, Tho', by the Crime of Fate, despoil'd of Pow'r. Queen. How stand our Party? are they firm, and bold? Dum. By the Oppressions of the Tyrant ripen'd, They're ready for all Attempts for Liberty. I urg'd your wrongs, nor did forget my own; And laid our suff'rings on the public Score, Our Zeal against the Kings Despotic Pow'r. Queen. That was well urg'd, a sure, and popular Bait. Dum. And so was swallow'd by the giddy Throng, Who full of Vengance meet this very hour, In the deep valley, near the ill-guarded Castle; With the Surprize of which, we shall begin. Retire into the Temple, 'till the Shock is over. Queen. The King's now there, in outward shew, to offer The Roman Spoils to Hermes:— But guilty Love lurks ev'n in his Devotion, My hateful Rival's all the Gods, he worships. Dum. I must begon; methinks, o're yonder hill, Faint glim'ring Points of Twilight pierce the Gloom, And wound retiring Night, sure day is near. Queen. Behold the King! Dum. I'll not be seen, but hast To use our Party, while their Furies high. We often loose our wishes by Delays. [Exit attended. Queen. I must pass by him e'r I reach the Temple. I see a murd'ring Fury in his Eyes I wou'd avoid—but 'tis to late to shun him. Enter King, Guards, and Attendants King speaks entering. Hast all; flie every one a several Way, Disperse your selves thro' every Road and Path. Bring back my Love, or else return no more. Hold—here's my Fate; stay all and seize on her, [Seeing the Queen. Qu. Seize me!—stand off ye slaves, I am your Queen. King. You are my Slave; a bold, offending Slave; That, with an Impudence of Pride, presumes To check my Wishes, and oppose my Will. O! worst of Women! for in that's contain'd The Sum of every thing, that's infamous. What hast thou done with Guinoenda tell me, For thou alone canst tell, where is my Love? Qu. I once was call'd, nay I was sworn your Love. King. Yes, to my shame, too well I lov'd you once; Lull'd by thy Charms, I lay in passive Slumbers And to my foolish Love betray'd my Pow'r; Uxorious to a frenzy, let your Will Dispose my Favours, and o're-rule my Laws. But a tame Husband makes a Wife audacious, Since therefore, you so ill have us'd your Pow'r I now resume it, and exert your Lord. Queen. They're not my Crimes I suffer for but yours, Had you been just, you still had thought me good; But when your wandring Eyes led your false Heart To wish deprav'dly for course homly Viands, And loath the costly Banquet of my Love, You seek a Refuge then, for your Injustice; And with fictitious Crimes you burden me, T'excuse your sordid fondness of a Beggar. King. No more—you've sure forgot your life is in my Pow'r. Qu. No, you base perjur'd King, Iv'e not forgot it: I know your Pow'r too well:—the Gallic Laws Give Men o're Wives a Pow'r Unjust, as Great, Nay more, I know thy Impotence of Mind Unable to resist the Lust of Vengeance; Ev'n to thy Ruin thou'lt pursue my Life. Yet I will torture thee before I die, And please my injur'd heart, with thy wild Raving's, Thy Cruelty can only reach my Body, But I will rack thy Soul; for know, false man, Thou never shalt possess thy guilty Love. King: Ha! never shalt possess her? Queen. Never. King. Never? Then thou hast slain my Love? Qu. I will not tell thee. King. O! insatiate Cruelty of Woman! But thou! thou art suparlatively woman! More cruel far, than storms, or raging flames, Than War, or Want! O! Woman! Woman! Woman! No hand can draw that Ill implacable, No Words describe! What ever God design'd Woman, design'd to Man the utmost Evil And the most cleaving Mischief. Qu. Rage on, rage on; it gluts my hungry Wrongs Thy Pangs are food— King. I will not hear thee speak. There's such a Discord in thy hateful Voice, It jar's upon me, and untunes my Soul, Yet do not boast too soon; no easie Death Shall be thy cursed Lot, no I'll torture thee With such a strange Variety of Torments, They shall surpass thy Cruelty; And make thee curse thy fond or'e-weening Pride, That durst provoke my Rage. Away with her. Qu. I go—but first know this,—thy Rage I laugh at. Weak Exhalations fed thy Meteor Pow'r, Which now worn out, in one expiring Blaze Shoots swiftly downward to the Earth for ever, No more to shine aloft in thy false Orb; While I in spight of all thy fancy'd Terrors, Thy feeble Threats, and impotent Commands, Shall with my foot tread out the slimy Vapour. King. Away with her, and in the Castle shut her; [they bear her off. My next Commands shall prove my Threats not vain, But Racks shall first extort the horrid Secret Of Guinoenda's Death, Oh! dismal thought! O're her dear Ashes shall the Traytress fall. Enter Guinoenda in Mourning follow'd by Rhesus, and Attendants, and Druids. What do I see? my Guinoenda here! Then my fears vanish, and my Joys return, Yes yes, my heart, 'tis she! she breaks upon me, Like a fair day after a stormy Night! But she's in sorrow! say my lovely Fair, Why drooping thus, and why these falling Tears? That please the Eye, but deeply wound the Heart? Guin. Oh! I am lost! I perish! oh! I'm nothing For when my Rhesus perish'd I dy'd too! King. Ha! Guin. My Rhesus! O! miserable Woman! How can I utter the destroying sound! Ay me! my Rhesus, Rhesus is no more! King. How know you this? Guin. Alas! it is too true! King. Who brought the News? Guin. Behold him there! Ah! me! methinks I see my Husband in him! King. Whence, and what is he? Guin A Noble Britain Escap'd the wreck; where oh! that he had perish'd Were but my Rhesus safe! King. Then he is drown'd? Rhes. With Pain I saw him wrastling with the Billows Desperate of humane Help. Guin. O! wretched Death! Unbury'd he must be a wandring Ghost Shut out, ay me! shut out from Rest below! King. Come quit these fruitless sorrows for the Dead Pursue no more with empty Love a Shadow, That thinks no more of you. I long have lov'd you, With a most constant, and most fervent Passion, Ah! pity then a Monarch, that dies for thee! Guin. Oh! my Lord there is, there is a way, To touch my Heart. King. Oh! name it, name it quickly! Guin. Pity the dead, and I may pity You. King. A Bribe like this, wou'd make me wish him living, Guin. My Lord, Sure I may call you so without a blush, Since he is dead that had my heart, by Right, I have a Boon to ask, the Grant of which Wou'd lay so kind and Obligation on me I shou'd with difficulty deny you ought. King. Take, take my Crown! all I command be thine, Be thou but mine. Guin. Nay I will kneel, and begg you by your Hopes! By all your wishes!— King. Oh! rise! I must not, cannot see you kneel. Guin. All that I ask, is but to bury Rhesus According to the holy Rites of Britain. King. Do it where you please in Bayonne. Guin. It must be done at Sea. King. How? Guin. Alas! I know not! King. O! pleasing Messenger of welcome News! Inform us how you bury ship-wreck'd Men. Rhes. According Sir, to their Abilities. King. A King? as Rhesus? Rhes. For him we must prepare Provisions, Victims, Royal Robes, and Arms. These by his Queen, and all her Orphan Children, From some swift Boat, must, with their Pray'rs and Tears, Be thrown into the Ocean. King. How far at Sea? Rhes. So far, that with an akeing Eye, you scarce From land can see them; that the Surges may not Roll back the Expiations to the Shoar. King. Can't you, without your Queen, perform these Rites? Rhes. Without her, Sir, we but prophane the Rites. King. Methinks I wou'd not venture her so far, Least the sad Ceremony awake her Love, And there transport her to some desperate deed. Guin. Oh! my illustrious Lord, I needs must go, Shou'd I neglect this duty to the dead, The dire tremendous Judgments of the Gods Wou'd swiftly fall on our devoted heads, And crush us both. This is no idle Dream Of fond Enthusiasts, or the credulous Vulgar; But known Examples every day confirm The dreadful Truth. King. I know not what to say But all my fears, are only for thy safety. Guin. Oh! fear not that, my Lord, I wou'd have dy'd To've sav'd his Life; but now what wou'd my Death Advantage him? Oh! then permit me, Sir, To pay this last sad duty to his shade: 'Twill teach my heart to love you as I ought. Rhes. You shou'd encourage, Sir, her pious zeal Since now she must be yours. King. You shall prevail. But do not wast thy Beauties, with these Weepings. The dead are nothing, and I'll love thee more, Than Rhesus cou'd. Oh! give his Grave thy sorrows And give me all thy Heart. Guin. This day will shew how much I love my Friends. King. Go therefore Fair one, with auspicious Omens! If Beauty touch the Gods thou must prevail, If not thy Virtue surely cannot fail. Each Watry God will smooth his stormy Brow, Melt at thy Pray'rs, dissolve at every Vow; Th'unrelenting Pow'rs of Night appease, And give at last thy wandring Rhesus Ease: Thy grateful Victims double Joys will gain, And put an end to both our ling'ring Pain; Our wish'd Elizium, on us both bestow Mine here with thee, his with the shades below. Rhes. O! vain, and short-liv'd Joy of guilty Love! [Aside. King. Here, from my Breast let Pleasure spread around! And in loud Eccho's all my Joys resound, Let Mirth sit smiling now in every Face, And sportive Revels fill each gladsome Place. Let pensive Envy furle no sullen Brow, But struggle up to hostile Raptures now. Let every Breath, and every Voice proclaim, To every Ear, by every Tongue of Fame, That Guinoenda owns at last my Flame. Away—while I my Nuptial Pomps prepare, Make hast kind Stranger, and bring back my Fair: Her Rites perform'd restore her yielding Charms, And bring her safe to my desiring Arms. Rhes. Alot great, Sir, from out the holy Tribe, Who must direct our boat, for pious Druids Alone must row it. King. Choose thy self the number. While Rhesus seems choosign among the Druids enter Morganius and Vaunutius just escap'd the Wreck. Vaun. On what strange Country has the Ocean thrown us? Morg. We've wander'd long among the craggy Cliffs, Bewilder'd in the Night, and pathless Rocks. Vaun. But now the dawning Morn has pointed us To this more certain track, we shall discover Where 'tis we are. Morg. No matter where; since we've lost Our Force, and Joy in Rhesus! Vaun. looking about spies Rhesus &amp;c. and stands fixdly gazing, at 'em. Oh! that the Gods had but preserv'd our King too! Perhaps they have! ha! what is't has surpriz'd thee! Vaun. Look look Morganius, but sure it is a Vision! Our King, and his lost Queen! Impossible! Morg. 'Tis he! 'tis she! Oh! wond'rous Providence! The swelling Joy transports my ravish'd soul! They both run to Rhesus, fall down and embrace his legs. Morganius speaks. O! my dear Lord! my King! most godlike Rhesus! Vau. We now are safe indeed to find you safe! [All start. King. Ha!—I'm then impos'd on! Guards seize them all, Vaun. Ha!—what can this mean! The surprize Rhesus and the rest, and disarm them. Rhes. Disarm'd! oh! cursed Chance! Morg. What strange Event is this? Guin. Oh! what what has your fatal Duty done! King. Oh! thou ingrateful Fair! thou base Impostor! You see the Gods declare against your Cunning, And keep a watchful Eye o're my Repose, I will consider how to punish all, As all deserve. Walks up and down discompos'd and thoughtful. Guin. O! Gods! O! cruel fortune! thus to loose, Ev'n in the Moment of expected Bliss, Our only hopes of Liberty! Mor. Oh! Sir, what have we done? Rhes. Alas! Morganius! Your ill tim'd Love has ruin'd all our hopes! Thro' various Storms of our disastrous Fortune, Our shatter'd Bark, was Just in view of safty When Fate brings You, like suddain furious Gusts Of Adverse Wind, that drives us out again To certain Wreck in the tumultuous Ocean. Morg. O! cursed Fortune! Vaun. O! destroying sounds! Morg. Oh! that we'd perish'd innocent of this! Rhes. 'Tis Fortunes Crime, not yours, then grieve no more, Chance may destroy our Happiness, not Virtue. King. Captain conduct these Britains to the Altar Of injur'd Neptune, for they are his due, There strike their Heads off, and appease the God. As they are going to bear them off, Guinoenda flies to Rhesus and flings her Arms about him. Guin. I will go with him, wheresoever he goes. King. No you must stay with me. Guin. Dead, not alive. I will not quit my hold while I have Life. Embraces him close, as he does her. Rhes. Oh! this, this Moment let me perish! Guin. O! Tyrant! Let now thy Rage be merciful, and kill us. King. Kill You! no, by my dear warmer hopes, The pleasing Pangs, and Agonies of Love, Are all the Deaths I'll give thee. Rhes. Gods! Gods! must I Hear this, and not revenge it? King. Ha! it shall be so—no thou shalt not die yet, But live to see my Nuptial Rites perform'd, See the fair Bride conducted to my Bed And to my Arms surrender all her Sweets; See me dissolve Raptures on her Bosom, And in those Tortures die. Rhes. Insulting Tyrant! May Cankers eat thy guilty tongue, that utter'd Those hateful sounds, Madness seize thy Mind, That form'd the foul Idea, and on thy Person Fall all the Plagues, that Tyranny calls loud for. King. Curse on, curse on, while I enjoy the Cause Of thy vain Curses, while I posses thy Queen. Yes I will force her stubborn Beauties to me, Amidst her Tears, her Curses and her Cries, Invert the Tale of Semele, and Jove And in her Tempest will enjoy my Love. Rhes. Oh! for a sword! or Bas'lick's Killing Eye! Guin. O ye just Pow'rs assist us! think not Tyrant The Gods will always sleep, that seem to nod: A while they let thy Wickedness prevail To make their Punishment the more illustrious. King. Away with them to the Castle. There let him wait my speedy Summons. Guin. O! Rhesus take me with thee, or I die! Nay by the Gods I will not live without thee. King. Tear 'em asunder—Death ye slaves, away! Guin. Oh! my Rhesus! must we then part for ever? Rhes. I will not think so impiously of Heav'n. They force him off, and she being rent from him, falls to the ground. Guin. Oh! stay! I charge you, do not bear him from me! Force not my Love, my Life, my Soul away. King. Rise up, my Fair, and see a happyer Lover. Guin. Oh! Rhesus!—break, break, my heart! Oh! for daggers, Poison! any thing to end tormenting Life! Why wont you kill me? King. Because I love you. Guin. If you do love me, why d'you make me wretched? King My Love is certain, but your Ills imagin'd. Guin. Oh! I am miserable, without your Pity! King. How can you ask, what You refuse to grant? Guin. Alas! I cannot love you! King. Nor can I Cease to love you. Guin. Reason shou'd arm your Virtue 'gainst your Passion. King. Not when my Passion's founded on my Reason. Why shou'd I not be happy, when I may? He knows his Pow'r but ill, that fears to use it. Guin. Be not unjust because 'tis in your Pow'r, We are a Proof how subject Pow'r's to Chance. King. Therefore the Wise enjoy the present Moment, And snatch their Bliss from Fortunes veering Hand, While with a smiling face she holds it out. In vain we wish those minutes wou'd return, Which we by Hopes, and Fears supinely loose. Therefore this Moment I will seize my Joy. Lead to the Palace. Guin. O! Sir, let me implore you! [kneels. By every thing that is or can be dear to you! Oh! by Religion! Heav'n! by all the Gods! I do conjure you hear me—hear me speak! King. Nothing against my Love I'll hear or grant. Your Eyes, your Face, your every Charm forbid Compliance with your Tongue. I will my self Conduct you. No strugling; 'tis in vain. They lift her up and force her gently forward she strugling. Enter the chief Druid. Guin. O! holy Druid, by thy Gods I charge thee Exert thy awful Pow'r, and help me now, Or strike thy pointed dagger to my heart. O! will you obey his hellish Will! Have you no thoughts of Justice, Honor, Heav'n? King. Madam, submit, nor Earth, nor Heav'n shall free you. Guin. Yes, impious Tyrant, yes I will be free, I'll hold my Breath, and perish so, I will, I will; e'r I will suffer thy abhor'd embrace. Oh! may the Gods show'r Plagues on thy curs'd Head! May Agues friez thee! and may Feavors burn thee! May Leaprosies o'respread thy hated Body, And make that foul, and odious, as thy Mind! May suddain Ruin reach thy guilty Pow'r! And Rebels sink thy Throne! King. Go on, go on. Druid. My Lord, my Lord, if you persist I must Here interpose my Pow'r against an Outrage So barbarous, as this. King. How! dare you speak? Confederate with her, in her plotted Flight? Enter Messenger in hast. Mes. My Lord the King! just now I have discover'd, Within the Valley near the Castle Walls A numerous Body, gather'd to a head, Led on, by, Dumnacus, they all declare They'l die for him, and for the injur'd Queen, And vow your Death. Enter a second Messenger. King. Ha! whence com'st thou, thus frighted? Mes. The Castle Sir's betray'd to Dumnacus, Which left in the Queen's Hands, he rolls this way The People from all sides come pow'ring in And in loud shouts call him Deliverer, And then in arm'd Squadrons, join him, as he passes, King. (Aside ... ) Confusion seize 'em!—this ill-tim'd Mischief Compells me fawn on this imperious Priest, Whose Nod can calm this Tumult of the People; That by the distance of my Force grow bold. But when the storm is, by his help, appeas'd, My Army shall be call'd to back my Will; And then no Temple shall withstand my Love, Nor any Dreams of fond Religion check me. ( ... Aside) My Druid, tho' you have conspir'd with her To rob me of all Happiness in Her, Yet still I dare confide her to your Charge, Secure her in the Temple from the Rage Of the misguided People, then haste to me. [Gives her to the Druid. Druid. Religion, Justice, Right direct my Actions And those oblige me now to succour you, Yet I must still declare against your Vices. King. All shall be mended, do but now your Duty.— Come on my Souldiers, to whose oft try'd Valour I've ow'd so many Triumphs, these home bred Foes, By Guilt, confusion, Ignorance of War Made weak, are easy Prey, they can't withstand Th'experienc'd Force ev'n of this little Band. [Exit with Guards. Guin. The Gods are just and he must surely fall. Druid. Retire to the Temple. Guin. Oh! no—but lead me— Oh! lead me te my Rhesus; to his Dungeon! For where he is, I there shall find a Palace Soft Beds of down, and all the Sweets of Life. Druid. 'Tis now impossible to lead you to him, The Fort being held by the rebellious Queen. Guin. Her name alarms my Fears. Druid. Fear not for him Her Intrest will preserve him. Guin. Well, lead me where you please, for I'm so wretched I care not where I pass those fleeting Minutes, This short Remainder of m'unhappy Life, Yet let me thro' all Dangers go To find my Rhesus, or you'l know too late No Temple is a Guard against my Fate.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. The Grove before the Temple. Enter Queen and Dumnacus, with the People Arm'd. Dum. I fear your Passion has betraid our Cause, For while we thus divide, our Pow'r is weak'n'd. Queen. If they will fight, there yet remain enow To vanquish his small handful; if they won't, Thus we secure at least this Place of Safety; And there make sure the Pledge of future Peace; Or if all fail the happy Means of Vengeance. Dum. Your Reason's good, Capt. surround the Temple; Place Guards at every door, and every Loop-hole; Let none come out, or enter but the Queen. Our common Safety's built upon your Care. Capt. My Lord, your Orders shall be strictly follow'd [exit. Enter a Messenger. Mes. As soon, my Lord, as you'd drawn off these Forces. As if with you, their Soul and Courage went, The Rest assaulted, by the furious King, Like Crouds of helpless Women fell, or fled. Till weary of the slaughter he recall'd His conqur'ing Troop to lead 'em against you. Dum. Curse on their timo'rous Souls, full of proud Boasts. Let him come on, I here will wait his Onset. Enter two Messengers. 2. Mes. My Lord, most strange, and most surprizing News! The Gods, when Mortal Aid forsook us, sent, I think from heav'n new force against the King. Queen. Speak thou again, thou bring'st new Life, new hopes. 2. Mes. Whilst in the Valley we withstood the King, The British Fleet all anchor'd in our Port, This by the Cambrian Pris'ners was discover'd; Who from the Ramparts leapt into the Sea, Swam all aboard, with loud Applause were welcom'd, And then, with fury, Rhesus led his Men To shore. Queen. (Aside.) O! Mischief unforeseen! the freedom My fondness gave him, has undone my hopes! 3. Mes. This the King hear'd while we were Pris'ners led, And gave us Freedom, alarm'd with this new Terror, He drew his Guards t'oppose the Britains landing, In vain—for Rage, Revenge, and Courage led 'em on. Enter a Fourth Messenger. Dum. What new Advice bring'st thou? 4. Mes. The King, my Lord, Dispairing to oppose the British Pow'rs, Headed by Rhesus, Has left a Party of his Guards to face 'em: While he retires this way to the Temple. Dum. That's as my Soul cou'd wish, his Journey's ended! The Journey of his guilty Life here Ends, The Britains press behind, and we before Oppose his Flight, betwixt, us he must fall, What more, my Daughter, cou'd our fortune give us? Queen. What more! good Gods! what worse cou'd happen! Dum. He must be for us, for we fight his Battel. Queen. Oh! no! he ne'r will join with us, besure, Who have design'd his Queen's, and Children's Deaths. (Aside ... ) If he prevail, I doubly am undone, I loose my Vengeance, and I loose my Love!— He, that in Dungeons cou'd my Love despise, What will he do with Conquest on his Sword? Bear off in Triumph, my detested Rival! And leave me here, slighted! ruin'd! wretched. Oh! Gods! I cannot, bear that Thought!— No to the Temple I'll this Moment flie; There seize my Victim, and before I die, I with this hand my Rival will remove, And Rhesus so, as well, as I shall prove The Pangs of my Despair, that durst despise my Love. ( ... Aside) Exit. Enter King, and Soldiers with their Swords drawn, King. My fellow-Soldiers, The Foe, you see, is but a Nerveless Limb Of those tame Rebels, you but now have beaten. The Foe behind, that like a roaring Torrent Comes rolling on you, with a swift Destruction, Has left thro' these our only way to Safety, The only passage to my conquering Army. Enter chief Druid, with a troop of Druids, and holy Banners. Dum. Fall on my Friends. Chief Druid. Ha! Rebel! dare you view these awful Banners? These consecrated Robes? these holy Wreaths? And know the Doom that dwells upon my Tongue, Yet stand in Arms against your King, and me? Dum. I'm not his Subject but an injur'd King. Druid. Lay down your Arms Rebels e're I curse ye, And pour th'avenging Plagues of angry Heav'n On all your impious heads, 'tis I 'tis Heav'n, That summon your Obedience! quit,—forsake Fly that Ingrateful instantly—or— Dum. Hell, and Furies! this canting Dotard routs me! Will you be aw'd from Liberty, by Words? Assess; Dolts;—fall on—Liberty! Liberty! None come forward but Dumnacus, who advancing to attaque the Druid, and the King is Immediatly kill'd. Dum. Confusion seize you all! I'm slain— [Falls. [when he is fall'n.] Ye abject Wretches! Who durst not strike one Blow for all your Wishes! How you cou'd mutter 'gainst your vile Oppressions; Talk big in Corners what your Swords shou'd do For Liberty, and Ease. But when, like Men You shou'd do something Worthy such bold Threats, You quake, and tremble, you are by Nature slaves. So may you sink beneath your Burdens all! Domestic Plagues consume you! home-bred Feuds Destroy you all! Confinement, Poverty, And all the Curses of a Tyrants Reign Be—still—your Lot—oh!— [Dies. King Bear off his Body. [They bear it off. Enter some Soldiers flying. Soldiers. Flie, flie, my Lord, the furiuos Britains come. King. Turn, Souldiers, turn! You that have Vanquish'd Romans Flie not from Britains. You that love Liberty— [to the People. Against Invaders now defend your Country. Ch. Druid. Save You your Country, and restore their Queen. King. Restoring her, we loose a Pledge of Safety. Ch. Druid. Restore you her, and I'll ensure your Safety. King. Ha! Traytor! thou ensure our Safety! Then thou'rt Confedrate with thy Countries Foes! Begon, thou, and thy venal Tribe begon; Begon, I say, e're my just Vengeance reach you. Ch. Druid. Yes, we will go—but here too late thou'lt wish us, To shield thee from the Wrath of angry Heaven! [Exeunt Druids. Enter Rhesus, and Britains driving in the Gauls flying before them. Rhesus advancing toward the King, as his men do toward the Gauls. Rhes. Oh! art thou found again? What greater Fear made insecure thy flight? And fixt thee here, no more t'escape my Sword? King. Hold Britains hear me; for it much imports you. Rhes. What wou'dst thou say? King. Return, with speed return! Flie to your ships this moment, while you may; My conqu'ring Army comes, 'till when this Pass With ease We can maintain against your Fury. When they arrive, no Britain I will spare. Rhes. Peace, Vanquish'd Gaul, nor think to brow-beat Britains When ever Love, or Glory leads us on The Gallic Nation is too weak to stop us. King. Hold yet your Swords; and once more hear me speak! Rhes: Vain Trifler, I've no time to dally. King. Hold!— For your first Blow gives Guinoenda Death. Rhes. Ha!— Thou can'st not be so base, to kill a Woman? King. Depend on that, and see her bleed this Moment. Rhes. Thou say'st thou lov'st her, King. Better far than thou do'st. Rhes. And yet woud'st kill her? King. Rather, than see her thine; because I love her. Rhes. No, no, thy self alone thou lov'st, not her. King. The Love of both's so join'd, I can't divide them. Rhes. If you lov'd her, you'd seek her Happiness. King. But with my self not thee. Rhes. With thee, she's wretched. King. That yet she knows not; give her time to try. Rhes. Dar'st thou thus provoke me? King. Why not? provoke thee? What Terrors do'st thou fancy, that thou wear'st? In mortal Duel I have vanquish'd Romans, In League with Fortune, and the partial Gods,— How can I then fear thee? Rhes. Come boast no more what thou hast done but do, What e'r with Romans thou hast done, thou dar'st not Attaque a British King. King. Dare not? Rhes. Dare not. I will forgoe the Odds my Fortune gives me, And on this single Arm repose Success. Thy Quarrel is unjust, and all thy own; Spare then thy Men; I dare thee to the Combate. King. Oh! that thou durst but do this! Rhes. 'Tis thy Fear,— Thy Fear alone, that makes thee seem to doubt it. Thy tim'rous Heart confiding in mean Wiles Thou fear'st to trust thy Love to thy own Prowess. King. I'm all on fire to pierce thy haughty Bosome. Rhes. My fellow Soldiers, and my Country-men. When Public Good, or Safety calls, you all Shall share my Dangers: but my private Wrongs I will revenge my Self. For I shou'd blush On those to lavish Subjects, such as You. Not one of you advance to my Assistance 'Tis my Command. [to the Britains. King. You I command the same. [to the Gauls. Come on; for Love and Guinoenda!— Have at thy heart so swell'd with Pride of Virtue, As if thou wert a God! come this to try— Rhes. Come on Despiser of Heroic Virtue. They Fight and the King falls. King. Ha! to me indeed, thou art immortal! I feel Deaths Icy Hand about my heart! O! Guinoenda!—oh!— [Dies. Rhes. Bear your King's Body hence. [To the Gauls. The Gauls bear off the King's Body. Rhes. Let not Injustice ever think to prosper, For soon or late the watchful Gods o'retake it, So perish all the foes of Britain! Now, my brave friends, advance we to the Temple There from the Gods the dear Reward to gain The Aim of all our Toil, the End of all our Pain. [Exeunt Omnes. SCENE II. Changes to the Inside of the Temple. Guinoenda, Queen and Attendants with a Bowl. &amp;c. Queen. False is your Grief for what you most desire; Common delusive Arts of Woman kind, Ill therefore hid from me. Your boasted Love Avoids this test, where subtle Art is vain; The pow'r you know is mine; within my hands: Your husbands Life, a forfeit to that Pow'r, And only for your sake, your Guilt in danger. If therefore you this Minute drink this Bowl Rhesus is free, if not this Moment ends him. Guin. Swear by the God then of this awful Temple, Who, if thou art perjur'd, may revenge me on thee, He shall be free, as soon as I have drank it. Queen. I swear by Hermes, Rhesus shall be free When thou hast drank it. Guin. Hast, and give it me. [They give her the Bowl. O! Pow'rs severe! let here your Anger cease; Your Indignation let my Death appease; Pursue no farther my unhappy Race! Give me the welcome draught, that ends my Woes, And gives my Rhesus Life. [she drinks. This is a Cordial to my sickly Fortunes. Qu. And to mine.—since, by my superiour Genius, Thou now art fal'n, thy Rhesus shall be free, But free for me;— For know I love him, and he shall be mine. Let that torment thee.— Guin. If he be free, that fear will ne'r disturb me: For well I know the torture will be thine, If it be true, that thou do'st love him; for He will loath thy Love. Queen. Believe not that, my Charms are not so weak. Guin. Too weak you'l find to win a heart from me. Queen. Oh! be not vain of my fond Husbands Dotage; Nor think I shine with such a beamless fire, But I can warm your Rhesus to desire. Tho' my dull King my pointed Charms declin'd, 'Twas thro' the baseness of his vulgar Mind, For my excess of Brightness made him blind. Like bird Obscene, he took his guilty flight, From my fierce day to thy bleak dusky Night; Pleas'd with thy sickly Rays of inoffensive Light. But Rhesus like the Royal Bird of Jove, When from thy Gloom, he sees Me roll above, Will shoot, with Joy, up to my Sun of Love. Guin. Let him be happy, and I have my Aim. Queen. Can you so calmly then resign your Claim? No, no, thro' this I your Despair can see. Guin. That's only by the guilty felt, like thee. Why does thy feeble Malice toil in vain? Thou hurts not me with all thy bootless Pain. Unable my impassive Mind to wound, Back on thy self th'envenom'd darts rebound. The Shrubs below thee may thy Tempest fear, I move above thee in too high a Sphere. Survey beneath me thy vain Storm of Soul, And smile to see thy Mimic Thunders roll. Queen. O! pompous Shew of Virtue not thy own! O! fulsome dawb too artlesly laid on! Thro' the disguise thy swarthy Soul appears; Thy awker'd Courage but betrays thy Fears To leave him here with me, while thou must go Deserted to the dismal Shades below. Guin. Oh! I shall go where thou shalt never come, By Crimes secure of a severer Doom. Thy drossy Soul sinks to profoundest Hell, And there 'mid fiery Floods, and shud'ring Ice must dwel; No respit to thy Pains, thro' all the Round, Of vast Eternity will e're be found. While I pass forward to those blest Abodes, Where Souls refine, and ripen into Gods. Wait there a while the coming of my Love, Then with united Virtue upward move, Together, to the starry Realms above.— But I shou'd husband better my last breath; This scantling Moment lent by Miser Death, To begg the Gods, that they when I am dead, Wou'd show'r their Blessings on my Rhesus's head; Against all Evils wou'd his Guardians be; Against the worst of Evils, against thee. Turns from her and goes and kneels down at the Altar. Queen. What art thou gone? stay I command thee stay, I will not let thee have the Ease to pray; I will not leave thee till I've seen thee die, Before my feet beheld thee gasping lie, And with th'expir'ing Pangs, have fed my longing Eye. Enter Messenger. 3. Mess. Madam The doubtful Issue of the War's decided. The King is dead, and Oh! that I cou'd say The King alone! Queen. Hold—if what thou hast to say, Be not so pleasing, let me never hear it. In one blest Moment both my foes destroy'd! My Barrs to happiness; my Source of Pain! As yet I have no motive of Complaint. I see a boding grief fixt on thy Brow, That checks my Joy, and with a sullen gloom, Foretells a tempest near, to wreck this Joy. Well let it break—the hideous burst must come, And fate has arm'd me 'gainst the dreadful Blow. Thou wert still hear my Father; say, where is he? How does he? is he well? Conquers? or is vanquish'd? Mess. Alas! I fear to tell, what you must know, He's dead! Queen. Ha! blasted be thy tongue, as my hopes are! The Arm, that slew him, and that Coward Herd That did so ill defend his Godlike Life! Mess. Your Curses are forestall'd, the King, who slew him, Fell next himself: And conquering Rhesus comes To bear his Queen in triumph from this Place. Queen. Slave, not so loud, least she shou'd tast this joy, Before she die.—But Rhesus comes too late, Thanks to my stars, too late, to rescue her! But oh! my fortune, like a Misers Gift, Shews penury of Soul ev'n in it's Bounty My Pow'r is lost, all hopes of Pow'r are gone! And with those hopes, all hopes of love, and Glory. Nature, and fortune were at mighty Odds When I was form'd; Nature gave vast desires Fortune but scanty scraps of short Success, To make my fatal disappointments greater O! Love! Ambition! Duty! Father! Rhesus! What several ways you drag my tortur'd heart! And quite disjoint my Soul! Enter Rhesus, Druids, Britains, and Attendants. Mess. Madam the Cambrian King. Queen. I must resolve. I have no time to argue with my fortune. Ambition, Love deny me life without him! He shall be mine, or perish with me, here. Ch. Druid to Rhesus as they come forward. Pardon me, Royal, Sir, my Grief's his due He was my King, the last of his great house; Shar'd in my Blood, and 'till this fatal love, Did nought unworthy his illustrious Race. The Crown h'has left me is alas a Burden! Rhes. Your Grief is just, as all your actions are; And I shou'd share your pious Woe, but that My heart's so full of Joy, that I approach To end my Guinoenda fears, I can not think Of ought that's sad. Queen. My Lord, I hope Success Will not destroy your Justice I must one Moment, interrupt your Wishes, By staying you to know the fate of mine. Rhes. May all your juster Wishes prove successful! Queen. You are a niggard in your Pray'r, my Lord, And with a large Reserve, you choak your Bounty; While you will judge the Justice of my Wishes. But sure theyr'e just when they end all in you! I know a Woman, shou'd not say she loves; But I am prest too close, by fate, to wait The artful forms of tedious Ceremony; To introduce a truth, I can't conceal. Rhes. Madam, there's none so great or fortunate But wou'd be proud to wear the pleasing Chains Of such a charming Beauty.— But I was born for Guinoenda only, And her alone can love. Queen. But were she dead? Rhes. Far be The fatal Supposition! yet, ev'n then I cou'd love none but her, but oh! much rather I'd die my self; I'd rather the whole sex— But, Madam, harbour no such fatal thought, Oh! let not that betray you to attempt Ought against, her, for by the Gods I swear No expiation shall absolve your Guilt, Or e'r appease my wild, destroying Vengeance. Queen. Be not too proud, and Vain of your success; Our Army, now approaching, owns my Cause; We have a Nation, to supply our losses, You but a handful, far from all relief. Be wise, and snatch the lucky, offer'd Moment, Rhes. Threats are but vain, for fear ne'r reach'd my heart, And therefore, I must tell you Madam, There's something fatal in you shocks my Nature, Like suddain Illness in the mid'st of health. Your very sight has damp'd my rising Joy. All contraries in Nature may unite, Sooner, than we. Queen. Am I so loathsom then? Rhes. Death, and Guinoenda I wou'd choose Before an Empire, with the fairest She, That e'r was vain of Beauty, Proud of Pow'r. Queen. Insensible, dull man, take then thy Wish, Offers to stab him being hinder'd. stabs her self. And let the Grave unite you. Ha! disappointed! Here at least I'm right. Rhes Wrest the dagger from her. Queen. Your Malice there's too impotent; 'tis done Obedient Death relieves me from a sight, My sick'ning soul wou'd ake at; her vast Joy At thy Embraces; but it shall be short, Short it shall be; yes fleeting, as my hopes were! But then the Racks and Tortures that succeed Oh! double may they be, and long! that sight, Whose Image so delights my Rage, I fain Wou'd live to see—but—oh!—it! wo'not—be— [dies. Guinoenda rises and is led forward. Ch. Druid. Remove her cursed body, that polluted Our holy Temple with this hateful Murder. Guin. Methought I heard my Rhesus's melting Voice. The charming Lure brought down my mounting Soul That like a falcon towr'd aloft to'ards Heav'n. Ha! what fatal Scene is this! Rhes. My Life! my Guinoenda! Let not that sight now interrupt thy Joy. The Gods at last have snatch'd us from ill fortune, See here my noble Britains, all arriv'd! The King fell by my Sword, the furious Queen By her own hand, ev'n in this sacred Temple. Guin. The Gods are just, and in the very Place Have punish'd her offence. It is enough 'Tis happiness enough to see thee free, To have thee by me while I am expiring, 'Twas all I had to ask my cruel Stars. Rhes. Talk not of death, now danger is remov'd. Now every God looks down, and smiles upon us Blesses our Love, our Constancy, and Truth. Guin. Ah! dream no more of happiness with me! For I have drank a draught, will quickly shew, None lov'd so well, and yet was so unhappy! Rhes. Now heav'n forbid! what has thy Madness done? Guin. The Queen just now propos'd this fatal choice, To live without my Rhesus, or die for him. I cou'd not long delib'rate which to choose But on her Oath to save your Life, I drank The fatal Bowl. Rhes. Oh! unexpected! oh! too cruel Treachery! Run all to seek some help, some Antidote. My Kingdom for her Cure. Guin. It will not be! I find it spread thro' every vital part, And to my heart it takes its chilling journey. Rhes. Is this heav'n's care of Innocence, and truth! Ch. Druid. Be patient. Rhes. Tell me not of Patience Were I on the Rack, m'extended limbs Disjointed, my Bones all crush'd in pieces, I might bear that, without a groan, or pang; But oh! this Rack of Soul cannot be born! Guin. Ah! grieve not thus! That adds a double terror to my fate. Rhes. O! Guinoenda! I am vastly wretched! Guin. Ha! now I feel the fatal gripe of death! Support my sinking body in thy Arms. O! glorious Sun! O! quickly setting Beams! Setting to me for ever! O! ye Spheres! That roll above with animating fires! Rhes. They see us both most wretched. Guin. O! vital Air! O! Earth! O! British Mansions! O! genial Bed! that I shall ne'r see more! [declines her head. Rhes. Lift up thy beauteous head, my Love, nor leave me! But move the Gods, that can do all, to Pity. Guin. In vain! in vain; I see the grizly Terror. With hideous Importunity, it waits To waft me over to th'eternal shades. Rhes. O! dismal Sounds! O woes too vast to bear! Guin. Haste set me down, my feet will not support me; And a dark Night slides, on my languid Eyes! Rhes. O! miserable Rhesus! oh! words more piercing, And far more terrible, than Death it self! Oh! thou art grown so much a part of me, That on thy fate my life, and Death depend. Guin. I have prefer'd thy safety to my Own. I might have liv'd; but chose to die for you For rob'd of you, indeed I cou'd not live. Oh! then my Rhesus, grant my last Request. Rhes. Oh! Name it quickly, that I may have life To grant it. Guin. Where are my Children? call them To take a sad farwel of their poor Mother. Rhes. O Guinoenda! sure my heart will burst! Oh! take us both, ye Gods, or spare her life. Enter Children. Guin. I know you love these little Ones, as I do, Be tender of their Childhood, guard their Youth; For I am leaving them! this Moment leaving them! For ever leaving these dear pretty Orphans. Farwel, my Children, may you both be happy, More happy, than your Father, or your Mother! Ah! love my Memory, as I have lov'd thee! Rhes. Coud'st thou resign thy life for me, and think, I e'r cou'd cease to love thee! O! ye Gods! Who have ordain'd this fatal Tryal, witness! How much I love my Guinoenda! yes While this wretched Remnant of my Life (Which sure such Woes will shorten) does remain Thee only I will love, and think on thee alone And when kind fate shuts up my gloomy day In everlasting Night, within one Grave I will lie by thee! no fate shall ever part us. Guin. Here from my hands receive these charming Pledges Ah! be their Mother too, as well as Father! Rhes. Alas! there's a Necessity for that! Guin. Ah! now, my Rhesus now I die! Rhes. Oh! take me with thee, for I will not live! Guin. Ah! live! these loose enough, in loosing me! Rhes. O! Gods! O! Fates what! Treasure you take from me! Guin. A leaden slumber falls upon my Eyes! Rhes. Oh! leave me not! forsake not your poor Children! Guin. Not willingly: but Oh! farwel! Rhes. Ah! look but on us! Guin. I'm going! Rhes. Ah: leave us not! Guin. Farwel! [dies. Rhes. O! wretched Rhesus! speak once more! Stay but, a Moment! take, ah! take me with thee, Oh! Oh!— [He stands fixt, and gazing on her. Manse. O! Mother! hear me! speak to me; 'tis I 'Tis I call on you; 'tis I that kiss your lips, And press your hands, O! my dear Mother! Tyr. Alas! my Sister you call in vain on her, That cannot hear you now, we both must share This Woe, for both have lost the best of Mothers! Rhesus starting up. It shall be so!—we'l be inter'd together? Fate cou'd not part our Loves, nor shall our Bodies. Ch. Druid. My Lord be patient: bear it like a man, Rhes. O! Druid! she was the tenderest Wife! So good! so soft! so loving! Gods! Oh! Gods! Yet she is dead! by hellish Treachery dead! The best of Women slain by the most Wicked! Ch. Druid. We all are born to die. Rhes. Why do I live then? O! Guinoenda! must I live without thee! Ch. Druid. Remove her hence, the Sight too much disturbs him! Rhes. You shall not take her from me By Heav'n I will not part with her, 'till death Has made me like her. No I will hold her Press her cold body fast within my Arms; Unweary'd gaze on her benighted Eyes; And 'mid ten thousand tender ardent Kisses, Breath a new Life into her.— Here I will fix immoveably fast 'Till I've transfus'd my Soul into her Body!— I feel it on the Wing already.— [faints away. Ch. Druid Go bear him gently to my Bed, [they bear both off. And take peculiar Care of his recovery. Be comforted, my Boy, thy Father lives. And Fate foredooms him a more glorious Death. The Gods prepare him by this mighty Tryal, For Deeds illustrious as his future Race. Thy Mother might have longer life enjoy'd But ne'r cou'd with such Glory have expir'd The Phœnix of her Sex, the only Wife; That for her Husband, durst resign her Life. Tyr. Sorrows begon! Revenge will be more worthy me, than Tears! I feel unusual Vigour in each Nerve The godlike Genius of my drooping Father, Shook from his Breast by his prevailing Sorrows, Doubly informs my Soul, and fires my Blood. Come on my Britans— Unsheath your Swords, and with wide-wasting fury, Fly to revenge your Queen, as Britians shou'd; As Britains will when ever Gaul shall wrong them. Burn kill, destroy, that, all around, the Shrieks, And Groans of dying Gauls, may rend the Skies, 'Till Rhesus starting at the gladsom Sound, With fullen Joy surveys our dreadful Deeds, Leaps from his languid grief, to join our Rage, To share the early Glory of his Son And so compleat the Vengeance, we begun. [Exit with Britains. Ch. Druid The Gods, the Gods speak in this fiery Prince; The happy State of Bayonne's near expiring For humane Greatness has its stated time, This days Events most plainly proves this Truth. Invain we seek for happiness below! We chase a Shadow, court an empty Shew! Like the false flame, that fleets before our Sight, Amid the gloomy Vapours of the Night, It gives us here but an alluring glance; A fickle Pleasure, mixt too much with Chance. The Soul pursues it with impetuous Love; But ne'r will find it, 'till arriv'd above. FINIS.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">THE EPILOGUE. Spoken by Mrs. Porter. Written by Mr. Burnaby. Our Author here, has treated you to day With a dull, Moral, out of fashion Play. Where he wou'd teach you Trifles you despise, To serve your Country—and to love—your Wives! Some Likelyhood he'd given each Pretension Had this a Settlement, and that a Pension. A Wife he makes a plain, dull, faithful Creature, I thought a Poet always Copy'd Nature! None but a Sot in this Eloping Age Wou'd think to make us honest on the Stage! True to ones Husband! 'tis a rueful Ditty! When Seperation's got into the City. And who e'r thought to see a Change so sad The Play-house Sober, and the City Mad! Within the Walls this Thought has Mischief in't For shon'd each solid Cuckold take the Hint And bring his Horns, in open Court, and try her, Divorce wou'd seize more houses, than the Fire! Poor Women every Way lead wretched Lives You hate Grace in us, yet force it in your Wives. Thus the same Fate, by different Ways both find: We starve by being honest, they for being kind.</field>
