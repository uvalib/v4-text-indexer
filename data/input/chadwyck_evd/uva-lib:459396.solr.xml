      <field name="fulltext">Actus Primus. Enter Foxe. Fox. Knights, Gentlemen, and Yeomen, attend her Graces seruice; sheele abroad. Enter Cranwell vshering the Dutches of Suffolke, a Gentlewoman bearing vp her trayne, Bertie, and Gentlemen. at the other doore Beggers. Cran. Be vncoverd Gentelmen. Fox. Rome there, backe Beggers. Dutch. Bertie, deale mine Almes. Ber. Pray for the Dutches, friends. Beg. Heavens preserue your Grace. Exeunt Beg. Enter one with a Letter, delivers it kneeling. Dut. What saiest thou? from my King? I kisse his lines, As humbly as my infant penitence, When due correction threatned mine offence: She reads and smiles, I may intreat the Palatine with grace, All curtesie and favours, for my Soveraignes sake, I will present him with smooth countenance, But for the poynt heere touching Marriage, Beseech my Prince of pardon, since, as yet, My Widdowes teares are scarce wipt from my cheeke, Touching the businesse, boute Sir Roger Willowbie, My deere neere kinseman, Ile not returne You empty handed backe, but send His highnesse Parram Lordship to dispose, And thanke his gratious providence for him. Returne my salutations on my knee, And say my whole possessions are all his, Berty reward his paines, On; Enter Gardner to the Tower guarded. Stay, and know the reason of that guard, How? giue mine eyes the fulnesse of their wish, Skreene not my Ioyes, I pray stand all aside, My Gossip Gardner led vnto the Tower, Tis pitty, nay man leaue your curtesie, My passion has no teares to answer you, Truth now I hope hath got a holliday, Exit Gardner. The tyrant Wolfe in hould, the Lambes may play, Forward to Sussex house in Barnisby street: More obiects yet of comfort? what is he? Enter Bonner guarded to prison. Fox. Bonner commanded to the Martialsie. Dut. Fagots will then grow cheape, they say, my Lord, That you haue bought vp all our fire wood, To send vs in a shining flame to heauen, But Bertie, see how leane has studdy made him, And his care with sweating in represse of errors, Enter Sands. An Ell will hardly girdle his leane wast. Sands, Ile defer your welcome yet from Cambridge, To shew you heere a president of zeale. Bonn. Madam hase scornes liue not with charity, My conscience is content to beare this crosse. Dutch. And mine as well content that thou should'st beare it, think'st thou I will disburthen thy content, Good man thou art deceiv'd, my charity Shuts vp the doores against thy misery, I tell thee, all my sorrowes are dried vp, With this sweete breath of comfort, to see thee, Infranchise truth by thy captivity. Bonn. Time flaters you awhile, heaven has a power, Can change the White to Sable in an houre, My welthier thoughts, yet tell me I shall liue, these scornes to quittance, your free heart to greeue, For time is rich in ransome, she may rayse, Exit with gard. the scorn'd and captiv'd Bonner, ware those dayes. Dutch. If Englands sinne deserues that curse againe, Doubtlesse my life the truth should still maintaine. Sand. The grace of heaven make strong that your resolue. Dutch. Tut Sands, I am no novice to beare off The gusty shocke of danger, heere is proofe, Hath bid the Cannon of rough threatning griefe, The deaths of one deere Husband, and two Sonnes, (Regenerate in the fame of their deserts.) Haue made a violent shot against this brest, But by the manly courage of that ioy, Is knit vnto my spirits, to behold The exild truth, now soiourning with time, The rage of their repugnancie recoyles, And I am Mistris of a Virgin heart. Bert. With pardon gratious Madam, Could Berties rude perswasion please your eares, I wish it cloth'd with Hymens royalties: A husband, like an Ammell, would inrich Your golden vertues. Dutch. How Men can praise themselues. Mariage is good, but wheres the husband good? A loving husband, Bertie, true in touch May sweare, so they wil be, few proue such. Bert. Durst my opinion venture, but to speake him, I could commend that merit to your heart, As I presume, your fancie would imbrace. Dutch. Void all the Chamber, Bertie, but your selfe, The husband now, come man, feare not to speake, Exeunt Servants. You haue absolution, ere you doe begin, The husband can report his true deserts. She sits. Bert. As much as observations greedy eye, Could well retayne, keepes warme vpon my tongue, Which to your noblest consideration was in honors wombe, And from her suckt his Nutriment of life, His spirit like an ensigne doth display The worthinesse of his heroicke birth, His more concealed vertues varnish that, To make his Comet (merit,) wondred at, Nature in moulding of his lyneaments, Has sham'd the cunning workemanship of Arte, That he is Madam, as your wish would make, The richer in desert for your worthes sake. Dutch. You haue describ'd the substance of a man, Such as might ravish the most chastest thoughts, Virginity could sinne in wish of him, For but on my deceased Brandons breath, Did never waite such rich perfections, In them I shall but re-espouse mine owne, Marry one Husband twice, embrace the dead, Hug in mine armes a Suffolke buried. Bert. If honorable Loue liue in a man, It guides the vertues of the Palatine. Dutch. The Palatine? has he your wishes voyce. Bert. Could it assure him of your fancies choyce. Dutch. His stately honors are vnmatcht for mine. Berty. His greatnesse reflects beames into your shine. Dutch. That greatnesse claymes a duty from my heart. Bert. No more then his loue offers your desert. Dutch. Your humble eyes see's merit, his will not, Our weaker worthes in Marriage are forgot. Bert. Nay rather Madam Wedlock doth inroule, The speciall essence of your rare deserts, Remembring your perfections. Dutch. I, they cou'd liue in your humility, And my affections best afford them thee, aside Whilst thy sweete tongue solicites for thy friend, Into thy bosome all my thoughts I send. Enter Cranwell. Cranwell what newes. Cran. The County Pallatine, now king of Poland. Dutch. King of Poland? Bert. Madam survey your thoughts, Master your feares, and crowne your happinesse, Dutch. King of Poland? Bert. Your Queene my hopes would see. Dutch. Queene of my rich desires in marrying thee, What of this king of Poland? Cran. He staies your graces leisure, Accompanied with the Earle of Arundell. Enter the Palatine being King of Poland, and Arundell. Dutch. Intreat their presence, Welcome royall Prince, My noble Lord. Palat. Madam, my latest service comes to bring An old affection from a new made king. Dutch. My Pristine gratulations thus accept The humble proffer of your soueraigne heart: But let me tell you, my thrice gratious Lord, You deale not Kingly, by advantag'd meanes To set vpon my infancy of Loue, To ambush lay it by intelligence: You know my meaning, theres a privie theefe I know you set to pillage my affections, He durst not else haue broke my secrets vp. His travell has not loytered in your sute, Nor will I be vngratefull to his paines. Enter Fox. The Duke Northumberland, with the Earle of Erbaigh, Desire to haue accesse vnto your grace. Dutch. More sutors? well, they are all welcome; vsher them in. Enter Northumberland, and Erbaigh. North. Health and faire fortune Waite on Suffolks Dutches. Dutch. Your wishes returne their vertues on your selfe. North. The king salutes you in my vassall breath, And bad me tell you, he received your gift With thankefull welcome, and bestowed the same (Peec'd out with honor, from his noble bounty) Vpon your cosen Sir Roger Willowby, Creating him Lord Willowby of Parram, To build remembrance of your gracious gift: Further he praies you to intreat this Prince, The Earle of Erbaigh with faire curtesie. Erba. Madam, the loue of your perfections Hath call'd me hither, and of them I craue, A welcome to my loyalty of heart. Dutch. I wish sir, my perfections of that wealth To rate so high a merit as yours is: But Princes, leaue this cheapning of my loue, It is a bad thing deere. Shall I beseech of you my Lord of Poland, and the rest, Princes or whosoever tenders me The humble service of his noble heart As to digest my choyce with patience: Amongst you I will choose, and at this time And in his like interre my vviddowhood, Amongst a throng of merits one but enters, One wins the Goale still, though a thousand venters, This man must but possesse me, let the voyce Of my affections, please all with her choyce. Arun. Pleas'd or displeas'd, you vvomen choose your liking, And reason you should haue it, or als one Youle take a fall to haue it; fancies force Makes honest plainnesse often speed the worse, Choose Madam choose, and please thine owne content. Berty. The king of Poland Madam. Dutch. How this fellow Wakes my remembrance for the king of Poland, As though my fancy hung vpon his tongue, I never shot a blunted arrow foorth, Nor shall my choyce recoyle vpon his worth, Whom Ile call mine; come worst of fate, Berty I choose thy selfe my marriage mate, Vpon this low foundation I erect The Pallace of mine honors, on this knee I place the head of mine authority; Let hand from hand exchange their offices, Whats mine is thine, thine mine, seal'd with this kisse. Arun. How madcap Dutches; what and ioyne lips to? What ere we thought, I see it is a match. Dutch. You see blind fancies follie in my choyce, His worth prevailes, nor will I change my voyce. Berty. By the deere loyalty my thoughts doe owe To this vnmeasur'd grace you heape on me, And by the vertue of a Christian faith, The rellish of this blessing is so strong, That when I leaue to loue, I liue too long. Dutch. Princes, let your displeasure chide his merit, Which stole my loue your honors would inherit. Palat. My fury thus bursts forth, to wish increase Of your spouse vertues in your liues sweete peace. Erba. My hatred dies not so, but I would see Your merits liue in your posteritie. Dutch. Whereat frowne you sir? Fox. I hope it is no breach of duty, to conceale Our close affections, they are priviledg'd, And I will keepe them so, you haue my seruice; If it may pleasure so; if not, I care not: Ile mourne mine owne sinnes, Take your Cloke and spare not. Dutch. If you be tired with the wearing it, Goodspeed you, Ile not breake you backe with care. Fox. You haue my heart, whil'st I an honest asse, (For so I count all men of patience,) Haue laden it with whole loades of businesses, With iaunting on your errands, drudgt at home, With so strong diligence, that sleepe could scarce Approch my eye lids for a sennights space: The honor of your Celler liues in me, You scarce command a throat can gulpe a health, You thinke I flatter, take good fellowes words, And him whose merit claymes preheminence, By their opinion, deale your recompence. Bert. If you meane me, I will not canvase With you for the voyce of quaint opinion; Youle waye downe the scales, Her honorable loue, the gift of fate, Not due of merrit, doth advance my state. Fox. Why sir, might she not bestow her loue on me? Bert. She might. Fox. She might, more foole she did not, but al's one All friends now, heeres my hand, my spleenes downe. Bert, In this imbrace I send a generall loue, To all my fellow servitors: I know some lowres vpon my happinesse, How vndeserued, let my offices Of loue to you, and duty to her grace, In their impartiall verdit render vp. Cran. O, take my answere as the generall voyce, For from my mouth breathes their opinions: She lessens not her honours in your choyce, But makes you Lord of her affections, And them we serue not, but her royalties, Which, as they are not lessened, why should we Shrinke from their seruice; whom her loue doth honor, May challenge from vs speciall reverence, And so shall you, as homage for that loue, Whose soverainty commands our services. North. Consent I see is liberall to this match, And offers franckly my applauding heart, Wishing of heauen to smile vpon your loues, That from them may grow vp such gallant spirits As my renowne this land with honor'd merits. Exeunt. Enter Bonner, and Gardner. Bonn. Good morrow to my Lord of Winchester; How doe you like our ayre i'th Marshalseas, From that ith Tower? vvelcome toot my Lord. Gard. Oh I thanke your loue, But had we once our liberties, We would set night vpon these morning skies. Bon. Oh that that houre were come, the king once dead. Gard. Whats that my Lord of London? Bon. I, pray man, pray, that heaven would take Our good king Edward to yon happy land, Hee's sicke, hee's sicke, heaven take the Infant child: For this crack'd world his vertues are too milde: Is not this charitable, what sayst thou man? Gard. But is the king sicke? Bon. And princes Mary vvell, Oh how I long to heare his passing bell, Soft who comes heere. Enter Clunie. Clu. Health to my honour'd Lords. Gard. That were, thou meanest. Clu. That are, I bring your Lordships from our anointed Queene. Bon. Queene? is Edward dead? Clu. King Edward, of that name the sixt, is dead, and Bon. Who, who I beseech thee, guides the state? Clu. She that repeales you to your former seats, Royall Queene Mary. Gard. See. Bon. Good hold my backe, this suddaine blast of comfort Blowes me vp, where is my rivall Ridley and the rest, They now shall fire for this. Clu. Sent downe to Oxford. Gard.

Then let our Suffolkes Dowager expect Answere for her scorn'd taunts, she threw on me of late That hot spirit, fire and flax, Madam fagot stick, If she recant not I will fagot her, If all the wood in Middlesex can door, Or Londons Bishopricke haue meanes to pay fort Ile not niggard her bones and I doe, arayne my charity.

I doe beseech your Lordships to suspend And smother your opinions till a triall Blow vp the embers to an open flame, Then censure as you find, and giue's your doome. Gard. If we but finde her answers halfe so calme. Bon. Yes as thunder, she calme? as a baited Beare, I will oppose my disputation, Against a Colledge of best discipline, Rather then with her braines, she sticks her iusts Like poysoned arrowes, in our tender spleenes: Thinking the sanctuary of her high birth To priviledge her fond presumption, Ber. My credit sir be pawnd. Bon. Yur creditÃ¨ tut tut, she hangs vpon the mercy of the Queene, But it will cast off her opinion. Bert. Should she be cold, my Lords, or set a frowne Vpon the alteration of her faith, Your Lordships know the somes of money due, From Charles the Emperour to her in the right, Of her departed husband, Suffolkes Duke, Which if your honorable licence would Assigne me a free passage to those parts To gather vp your vnexpected loue, Would heate her good opinion with the zeale. Where now the strangenes makes her somewhat stagger. Bon. Let him goe my Lords, you shal go speed him hence The way is broader vnto our reuenge, Which I haue sworne to take vpon the Dame, Whose scornefull taunts did so depraue my fame.

One Woman, and the Nurse that suckles her Child, And say you haue commandement from the Queene To stay there till her highnesse further pleasure, That she shall walke the hie-way to the Tower, Be gon, performe thine Office carefully, And I will pay thy paines as liberally.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Enter Bertie and Dutches. Bertie. Madam, my promise of your penitence, Wayed with the puissance of your high birth, Wherein you are alied vnto the Queene, Calmed the rough Menace of stout Gardner, And set a reverence on sterne Bonners tongue, Humbly to wish your reformation. Dutch. The Queene is neere and deere vnto my blood, In the remembrance of our mothers loues, Which chargeth greater sorrow at my heart, Then the huge shocke of their malignant threats; My soule hath lodg'd the Trueth, it shall not thence, Whil'st this weake flesh displayes her ayrie sence. Ber. But Madam, let your wisedome shut her vp, Commit her not vnto your state to guard, But humble your hie spirit, sleike your speech, That envy may not stumble at mistrust, Or find a rub to start suspition: Weare a smoth brow in presence of your foes, Be shaken with their threats, retreat your spirit, Till they insult vpon your patience: The Conquest won in your submission, They slake the eager pursute of revenge, To giue you time to purvey for your scape; You know my leaue of passage ore the seas, And with what cunning I haue color'd it, To free my conscience from the gaile of feare. Dutch. But still leaue mine vpon the rocke of care. Ber. I goe to seeke a releasement of that care, Freely to spread the ensigne of your Faith: A simple, rusticke home of liberty, Is worth your honors in captivity. Dutch. It is, it is, and would befit our hues, To weare them out in contemplation: There should we read, vpon the naked walls, The first creation of our wretchednesse; There no intruding obiects of gaie clothes, Imbrodered hangings, or rich tapistrie, Shall wound the seruice which we owe to heaven. Oh M. Bertie, there my wish would be; Change honor'd woe for poore felicity. Ber. Ile lay a Barke at Leigh shall stay for you, To be transported to me at Midelborow. Dutch. But who conducts me to that Barke at Leigh? Feare is a trusty guide, it is, it is, Shee that knowes no way, that way will not misse, I prethee goe, my Conscience to set free, My tender feet shall learne to follow thee. Ber. I goe. Dutch. Yet stay, nay goe, alas which way? And must we part? Ber. We must, My bodies heere, thou hast my heart along with thee Make much o'nt pretnee, till we meete againe, My body and my soule you both retayne. Dutch. Slip not my duty, I beseech your loue, To her for whom my sorrowes shed more teares, Then is my wounded Conscience charg'd with feares. Ber. Patience, good Madam. Dutch. Passion Master Bertie, My spleene is wounded with compassionate pitty, I could drop out my Liver, rob my life Of her deere essence, with immoderate sighes, For that sweete Princes, wrong'd Elizabeth. Now in the gripe of their pernitious hate, A guard of Angels ring her life about, From the malitious practise of her foes; Rebate their furies, crosse their treacherous wayes, Let truth in her outliue these bloody dayes. Ber. Amen, amen, what shall I deliver to her from your grace? Dutch. A comfortable salutation To that heart sorrowing Lady which my prayer From heaven has carried to her heart before. Ber. Will you ought else? Dutch. A kind embrace from you, exchange a teare, or two, And so farewell. Kisse. Ber. Oh this doth clog me more, waies downe my speed Should beare our fortunes to a soft repose, Not daring heere to peepe out of our thoughts, Without the danger of the Vulters gripe, Whose watching eyes of inquisition Steales covertly vpon our purposes, And yet you lag me with your loade of greefes. I could tosse woe for woe vntill to morrow, But then weede wake the wolfe with bleating sorrow. With what vnwillingnesse I part from you Let that and these receiu'd. Kisse. Adew, adew. Exeunt severally Weeping. Enter Cranwellâ Cranwell meeteth her. Cran. Madam. Dut. Now Cramwell, what would'st thou? thy M. gone. Cran. I am glad he stayed not, to peece out our mone. Du.

What remedy? this was my expectation: I was arm'd With compleat resolution, to abide The rigorous wrastle of this streame-borne tyde. Fainst thou at this? then thou wouldst swoune to see My honourd state changed to ragg'd misery. Cran. I will not liue to see that. Dutch. Then thy loue is tried: I thought it would haue lackied by my side. Cran: How meane you Madam? When it tires in service of your Grace, May I ne're more haue being on the earth, Were you to passe th'extreamest of all woe, Might I be worthy, I would share with you. Dutch. Vpon thy trust, then I repose my life, Provide me 'gainst this even a Citizens Gowne, Ath meanest fashion, like my present fortunes: This night Ile hazzard to escape from hence, Putting my feares into the hand of fate, To trample on or readvance my state, Wilt thou about it? Cran. With a winged speed: To cure your sorrowes this manly heart shall bleed. Exit Cran. Enter Fox, and Clunie. Fox. Madam this world is changed. Dutch: Change thou with it. Fox. Change, and I did it were no heresie: These humors graple with my honesty, But they are franticke fits, I let them passe. Dutch. Sir what are you? Clu: My name is Clunie, and now your graces keeper. Dutch. I heare you haue discharged my houshold Servants. Clu: It is her highnesse pleasure. Dut. Or Bonners hate, but I accept it with a thankfulnes. Clu: All are not yet discharged, but your choice May call two men, a vvoman, and a Nurse. Dutch: Nay, Cranwell is all I vvill beseech of you. Fox. Why Cranwell, more then Fox? Dutch: Because more staid, with him, Because of most continuance, And longest vvearing in my services. Fox: What meane you by this vvearing? I am sure, My vvits are vvorne as thinne as a Paper-leafe: But tis the fairest end of Serving men, When vve haue spent the pleasure of our youth, Ene sweate it out vvith painefull industry, To haue such itching slaues to eate vs out, Doe you so light respect me? I as light Will make of you, and it come vvithin my power. Dutch: Farwell, pull downe thy stubbornesse of spirit: There breathes no servant of more honesty: Wilt please your kindnesse, keeper, vsher me, To teach my steps to vsher misery. Exeunt Dutches and Clunie. Fox: Now Thomas? What vvill you doe now, Thomas? Your Mistres has discharged you, and your coate, Thomas, Which was as deere to you, as your skin, Thomas, It is puld over your eares, what remedy: Has Fox nere a hole to hide's head in these extremities Now I remember my Cozen Raynauld liues not far hence, To him Ile make repayre, and feede on countrey poultrey For a while, till I can cry Vindicta on this Dutches.

Exit. Enter Clunie with Guards. Clu. Search euery corner, heere, behind this gate Her mantle, oh the lucke, had we but staid To search this nooke, when fury bore vs hence With violence to overtake her course, We had prevented her intended scape But what heaven would not, could not, tis decreed, Her innocent life, should not by envy bleed: But heere we stint not, to pursue her flight, I know twill boyle vp Bonners rancorous spight. Exeunt. Enter Dutches. Dutch. Thus far, but Heaven knowes where wee haue escapt The eager pursuite of our enemies, Having for guidance my attentiue feare, Still I looke backe, still starte my tyred feet, Which never till now measur'd London street, My honors scornd that custome, they would ride, Now forc't to walke, more weary paine to bide: Thou shalt not doe so child, Ile carry thee In sorrowes armes to welcome misery, Custome must steele thy youth with pinching want, That thy great birth, in age may beare with scant, Sleepe peaceablie sweete ducke, and make no noise Me thinkes each step is deaths aresting voice, We shall meete Nurse anon, a dug will come To please my quiet infant, when, Nurse, when?

Passe we our feares with them, there staies at Lee A Barke that will redeeme our liberty, If you dare venture, with my fortunes goe, A tide of Ioy, may turne this streame of Woe. Cranw. How you resolue of me, I know not, try, And vvhen I shrinke, brand me vvith infamy. Dut. In heavens name, on then, fellowes all in sorrow, When we stand need, weele mutuall comfort borrow. Exeunt.

Clunie giue evidence against this wretch, Hath set his hand to helpe a traytor hence. Ien. Indeed my Lord I am no Traytor, I am a Tilor, Clunie tells your Lordship a fable, we saw no such Man, not vvee. Gard. No, wilt thou obstinately stand in it, Didst not thou lend him a disguise, imploy him Mongst other laborers about thy worke, And yet vvilt thou deny thou art no Traytor. Bon. Slaue, Villaine, Dogge, Haue we not heere the honest testimony Of mine owne Parator, that saw him clothed In thy apparell, and darest thou deny it, Fagots, fagots, hence toth' stake with him. Ien. Oh good my Lord, I shall never indure it, I was wance but burnt ith hand, and I haue bin The worse fort ever since, doe but heere me, Prooue that I had any other apparell this seven yeares, Then that you see vpon my backe, and burne me not, But cut me into rashers, and broyle me for Carbonadoes. Clu. My Lords as I am Clunie, and your Parator, This counterfeit simplicitude was he, That twixt the houres of 12. and 1. at Noone, Convayed the impious Traytor from our search, By shifting him into his homely raggs. Ien. Twixt 12. and 1. nere trust me, but at that very time I and my fellow heere, (canst thou speake nothing for thy selfe) were at dinner at mother Puttocks, with a piece of a Tripe and a blacke-Pudding, by the same token there was a candles end in't as long as my thumbe. Bon. So, so, yar a cunning Knaue, but sirra, sirra, This cannot serue your turne, you rescued him, And that by'th law is held as Capitall, As if thy selfe wert guilty of the crime. Gard. His crime my Lord is it not manifest, That hees a favourer of these Sismatikes, And vvhat is that but flat rebellion. Bon. Goe too, he must frye fort, he, shall I say the word, Bonner that ere long will purge this land with bonfiers, We come not with the Oliue branch of Peace, But with the sword of Iustice, these Hidraes-heads will still Be florishing, vnlesse at once we giu't a fatall stroke, Let them convert to ashes, let them burne, So shall the State be quiet : how now, vvhat newes? What haue you caught the Dutches. Enter Messenger. Mess. Most strangely sir, she did escape my hands, Besides at Billinsgate haue I kept narrow search, Yet for my life could set no eye on her. Bon. But vve haue all this vvhile taine a vvrong course, Shall vve imagine being hunted thus: She vvould commit the saue gard for her life To common passage, where she was assurd There vvould be diligent waight laid for her: No, shees more subtile, all the vvorld, my Lord, Shall not perswade, but shees in England still, In Marget, Lee, or some such bordering towne. Messen. And in good time I met a man of hers, One Fox, my Lord, a fellow, as it seemes, Disgrac't by her, that told me we were wide In that we vvent about. Gard. Where met you him. Messen. Comming from Algate. Bonn. Would he not confesse Which vvay his Lady Mistrisse vvas escapt? Mes. With much a doe my Lords, with threats and promises, At last he told me he would bring Where we might trace her, and intrap her too. Bon. Why brought you not that fellow to our presence? He shall haue dispensation how he will, So he be trusty, and performe his word. Messen. He promis'd faithfully to meete me heere. Bon. Well if he come, your eare. They whisper. Enter Fox. Fox. Now Fox devise to qualifie Thy nature to thy name, These be meere Caniballs That take no pleasure but in sucking blood, And though vnluckly it was thy chance, To fall into their hands, yet be not thou (How ever outward grievances may vrge) A traytor to thy Lady; smooth with these, That vnder collour to betray the Dutches, She may haue safer liberty to passe. Messen. See my Lords, hee's come. Bon. Come hither sirra, you did serue the Dutches, And tis no doubt but you can giue vs notice Which vvay shee's fled stand not vpon nice tearmes As fearing to incurre some deadly sinne, But tell vs plainely which way she is gone. Fox. My Lords, I cannot readily discover Which way shee's gone, by reason I haue bin Long in disgrace, and quite dismist the house, But sure it is, she went disguis'd from hence, And tis not possible but she must lurke, Within some Haven towne neere to the coast. Gard. What Towne, as thou imaginest? Fox. My Lords I thinke toward Dover, Or the Downes of Kent. Bon. Nay thats not likely, soft, some A horne. Newes I hope. Enter A Post. Post. Health to this honorable presence, I come to certifie your Lordships all, That as we kept the Ports on Essex side, Twas credibly reported, that the Dutches With little or no trayne, is lodg'd in Lee, And for she is disguis'd, and our Commission Expir'd the date, we craue a fresh supply, And some direction how to intercept her. Bon. No better meanes then to renew our vvarrant, And send this fellow with it that doth know her, Into vvhat shape so ere she be transform'd. It shall be so, I thanke thee Pursyvant For thy good newes, it glads me at the heart, I shall at length be even with this proud Dutches. At Lee in Essex, oh tis excellent: But I will tell you how't shall be my Lord, Fox shall not goe alone, Clunie and I Will beare him companie, and vvithall, ha, ha, I cannot choose but laugh to tell the rest, As shee's disguis'd to hide her from my flght, So vvill I be, to take her, in her slight, Is it not good, is it not rare my Lord, Nay is it not the best that ere you heard, When subtilty by fraud shall be debar'd, I vvarrant you shee's ours Clunie, Fox come hither, Provide you straight, Fox thou shalt goe vvith me, Ha, vvilt thou not. Fox. (A plague vpon you,) I must answer, I. How ere my heart abhor this treachery, My Lord I vvill. Bon. Why now thou pleasest me, And I will richly recompence thy paines, But for we vvill not, our affaires at home, In the meane time be slackt, or intermitted, You my good Lords shall haue a speciall care About it straight, Fox, Clunie, follow me, This is to Bonner chiefe felicity. Exeunt all but Fox, and Jenken. Fox. Yes, I vvill follow, Though not further ye, I trust this is a meanes ordain'd of Heaven, To bridle this bloodsuckers cruelty, But how now, vvhat art thou. Ienken. Marry sir an honest man and a Tiler, that vvas sent for hither to bee examined about wan M. Sands, and it seemes for Ioy they haue to kno vvhere the Dutches is, they haue forgotten me, what were I best to doe. Fox. What else but get thee home vnto thy house, Away be packing, since they haue forgot thee, Doe not thou tarty to reviue their memory. Ien. Nay if I put them in mind on't, let me be chockt, For want of drinke, since Ale thou art so luckie, Ile take the tother pot while it is nappy. Exit Ienken. Finis Actus Secundi.</field>

If for the Dutches, if for Doctor Sands, For Cranwell, and the rest, they in disguise, Are got abord a Ship, and with full sailes, Flye from the Shore. Bon. Thou telst me a sad tale, Post Fox, run Clunie, hire a Parke with speede, Goseling we were suspitious of thy faith, But by this message, thou hast cleer'd thy selfe, See Goseling, I am almost drownd.

Bon. May all things prosper to thy hearts desire, Come Goseling, prethee lead me to a fire. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Bartie, and Pericell a Walloune. Bertie. And as I told you sir, with that excuse, I grounded this my colorable passage, And sent a ship, which staies for her at Lee, Where by appointment she had promis'd meeting, But She is so watcht, so guarded, and so bard, Of her true servants presence and accesse, That I despaire of her arrivall here. Pere. Good M. Bertie, cheere your drooping thoughts, We are Walloones, but in subiection, And strict obedience to the church of Rome, Rewards and promises, are sent abroad, To every forreine Prince, and Burgomaster, To stay the Dutches, for the rumor runns, She is escapt already from her house. Enter Sands. Ber. Tis very certaine M. Pericell, Now shall we heare some newes, Here's Doctor Sands. Sands. Newes of the Dutches, that will please but ill, I will forbeare to speake of our escapes, All which were wing'd, with fortune, and successe, And tell you of one haplesse accident, We all tooke Ship at Lee, but not together, For I alone past in a Hollander, No sooner did the wind blow from the shore, But rose a tempest, which disperst our ships, And we might see the Barke wherein she went, By violence of the waues forc'd backe againe, Even to the havens mouth. Ber. Even to deaths leane armes, Thy tragicke newes, hath slaine me M. Sands, We are as one, and what betide her person, I feele in a true essence of her griefe. Pere. In these extreames, tis good to hope the best. Ber. Oh M. Perecill, the worst of ills, Falls on her head, and can I hope the best, Shees like a Lambe, trapt with a heard of Wolues, A harmelesse Doue amongst a thousand Haukes, If she return'd, what providence can saue, A body doom'd already to the graue. Enter Cranwell, Dutches Nurse, Child. Sands. See M. Bertie, lift vp your sad eyes. Dutch. Bertie. Bertie. Madam. Kisse. Sands. Oh see the meeting of two faithfull soules, What a sweete vnion it doth of hearts, When one another mutrall ioy imparts. Dutch. Defer the story, of our dangers past, To acquaint vs with some comfortable ayd. Bert. Oh pardon me one minute gentle Madam, If I delay your faire request a little, To take my fellow servants by the hand, Good M. Cranwell, the firme loyalty, You beare your Mistrisse, in her great extreames, Shall be recorded in a booke of Brasse. Cranw. Alas I haue scanted of my duty much, My liberall will's ioyn'd with vnable power, With my true service I doe joune my life, And owe them both, vnto your princely Wife. Bert. You are a Mirror, Nurse, so art thou, Thy noble carriage, thus I Kisse with ioy, Alas poore Lady, thou, ere thou canst goe, Art forst to leaue thy countrey, thy returne, Will make them smile, that now are forst to mourne, Thy infancy in Pilgrimage is spent, Yet thy abode heereafter shall be Kent, And be an honord Countesse of that name, For so my true divining spirits doe ayme. Dutch. What Gentleman is that. Bert. Tis a Walloone Feris de Ryviers, alias Perecell. Dutch. May we repose with him? Bert. Madam you may not, Neither in this place may I challenge you, For I am noted and your comming hither, Both promised, and expected by great men, Who to surprise you, haue receiv'd reward, All Ports are laid, all passages are stop't, Search, and inquirie posts through every towne. Pere. Madam tis true, nor would I haue you stay, In Emden long, for you are laid for heere. Dutch. What shall we then doe? Sands. Madam, lets to Santon, Let M. Bertie stay with Perecell, And meete vs there heereafter. Dutch. Content, let it be so, Never two lovers, Married to more woe, Heere meete we, and heere part we, oh short pleasure, Which fortune serues vs, in too small a measure. Bert. My body is devided in the midst, That way goes halfe my heart, and this way tother, Necessity thy sterne deeds I beshrow, That thy rude hand, giues vs the parting blow, At Santon I will meete you Madam, heere Exeunt Berty, Pererell. I dare not know you, so adue my deere. Dutch. Berty farewell, to Santon bound we are, With these companions, and our conduct care, You people happy in a land of peace, That ioy your consciences, with the worlds increase, Looke with indifference into my sad life, Heere my poore husband, dares not know his wife, And I a Princes, to avoid like a danger, Must vse my owne deere husband, as a stranger, Towards Santon we, through deserts, any way, Though all should leaue me, I for griefe must stay. Cranw. Madam, you see what strictnes, we are forced to. Lets wing our feet, till we can get to Santon, Sands. Madam, let me admire your constancy, For heaven hath prov'd your patience every way, Yet you are confident, and more your zeale to trie, Yo'r forst your loyall husband to deny, Cran. Then what pale trembling cowards heart would faint, To wade through danger with so pure a saint? Enter 4. or 5. Theeues. 1. Thiefe. A bootie, stand, dispoyle them, downe with them. Dutch. We are beset with theeues. Sands. Sands, thou must flie, For weaponles, thou canst no mastery try. Exit Sands. Nurse. Theeues, theeues. Exit Nurse, and Child. 1. Theefe. Pursue them not, lets ceise on them that stay, Fight, Wound Cranwell. Cranw. Slaues, you haue murderd me. Theefe. No matter, ceise on her, and rifle both, Ha, by my faith a gallant lusty wench, Tis the best booty, that we met this moneth. Dut. Oh my true servants death, doth grieue me more, Then all the sorrowes that I felt before. They drawe her aside to rifle her. Enter Bertie. Ber. I am iealous of the safety of my wife, And to escape the better through the woods, I haue cloath'd my selfe thus in an Out-lawes shape, Oh, sight of ruth, my fellow Cranwell slaine: My wife graspt in the armes of ravishers, Then heaven instruct me with some present meanes, That I may find some aid to rescue them, I haue it, a booty, a booty, a braue booty: But we want helpe, and ayd to compasse it, Foure wealthy Merchants, are come downe this hill, Some little ayd, and we shall share them all. 2. Thiefe. Some of you looke to see the Woman safe, Ile helpe to take the booty. 3. Thiefe. And so will I. 1. Thiefe. One bird ith' hand's worth two ith' bush: Ile take my present purchase. 2. Thiefe. Weele share a both sides, come conduct vs to them. Bert. I will, stirre not from hence with her, Till we returne. Exeunt. 1. Theefe. My life for yours, come, will you vncase. Dut. Doe not disrobe me of my clothes, as y'ar a man. 1. Theefe. Tut, stand not vpon tearmes, I loue to see a Woman naked. Dutch. Defend me heaven. Enter Bertie. Bert. So ho, ho, I haue lost a Iewell, And left it heere behind, when I departed hence. 1. Theefe. What valew. Bert. More precious then thy soule, and this it is, Villaine, thinke not to scape, your mates are far enough. 1. Theefe. How goodman rascall. They fight, the Theefe falls. Bert. Thus Villaine, for the world, I would not stayne my hands with thy base blood: But rascall, I will bind you to the peace, Binds him. So now, let this ditch shelter you. Dutch. My Berty? heaven be prais'd, Though I am rob'd of all the wealth I haue, I am rich enough, in my possessing thee, Bert. Is M. Cranwell slaine? Cranw. But sorely hurt, and I am neere to death. Dutch. Bind vp your wounds, with this white hankercher, Bertie, I am so vs'd to misery, That it seemes nothing, wheres the Nurse and Child? Bert. Oh crosse on crosse, lets looke about the woods. Dutch. My Susan lost, I will not stir one foot, But to the Villaines be a second prey, Vnlesse I find her. Cranw. Lend me your hand deere sir, get I once vp, Ile spend the remnant of my blood thats left, In search of my young Mistresse. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Nurse, and Child. Nurse. Oh whither shall I flie, to saue my life, From the rude hands of these fell ravishers? My haplesse Lady, and her husband both, By this, haue felt the cruell stroake of death, Or which is worse, are captiue led away, Noise within so ho, ho Nurse. And to the Vulters gripes become a prey, Oh harke, I heare them comming, hence begone, Hard is thy hap, that must be left alone, Deere babe forgiue me, I am forc'd for life, Leaue Child. To ease my carriage, leaue thee to their strife. Exit. Enter Berty and Dutches looking. On forwards Madam, this way they are gone, Heaven be propitious, directs vs in our search. Dutch. Amen, amen. Enter Cranwell staggering, and falls neere the Bush where the Child is. Cranw. Oh I am lost, sinke body to the earth, Ascend my soule, mongst Saints receaue new birth. Dutc. Helpe Bertie, helpe, tis Cranwell faints, oh helpe. Bert. Speake to me man, looke vp, some wound belike Is yet vnstopt, from whence proceeds this large effasion, Its heere, lend me some linnen, so, so, he comes againe, And see heavens bounty, he at once hath given, Your Servant, and your Child: looke Madam, see, Throwne in a bush, and smiles, and laughes at yee. Dutc. Having my Husband, Child, and this my servant, I am the richest Princes on the earth, But Berty, where's the Nurse, and Docter Sands. Bert. Both fled, but wherefore Madam looke you pale. Dutch. Oh Berty, I doe feele the time approach Of my delivery, oh for helpe of Women. Bert. What shall we doe, I am beyond my selfe. Dutch. Cranwell, what towne is this that stands before. Cran. Madam, they call it Wezill. It snowes, and raines, thunders. Dutch. Goe, begon, Thy lookes pleads for a cunning Surgeon, We shall not neede, thy helpe, thy wound is deepe, But stay you Bertie, you the Child must keepe. Cra. Madam, this storme, the cold, and my deep wounds, May well excuse me, till my hurts are drest. Dutch. Be gon I say. Bert. How fare you Madam. Dutch. Sicke I am, heaven knowes, Ready to die, with these my pinching throwes, It raines, and hailes, and snowes, and blowes at once, Where Berty, may we hide vs from this storme. Bert. Here in this Church-porch, Madam pray remoue, Dutch. Helpe, and leade me thither, now lay the Child downe Berty. Goe gather sticks, to helpe to make a fire, More plagues my sinnes doe merit yeere by yeere, But these, good heavens are more then I can beare. Bert. Alas, alas, this is a homely place, To bring a Princesse of such state to bed, A wide Church porch, is made her bed-chamber, And the cold stones her couch, here are no curtaines, But the bleke Windes, could Clouds and stormes of hayle, And they begirt her round, heaven for thy mercy, This poore distressed Princes shield and saue, Whose cold head lies vpon some dead mans graue, Heere comes the Sexton, I will speake to him, It may be, he may helpe vs to releife. Enter Sexton. Sex. Gods sacrament vat maukt ye dare. Bert, Patience good sir. Sex. Vat bedlers in den kerke, loopt hence strax. Bert. Vncivell fellow, what thou speakest, I know not, But thy ill meaning by thy deeds, I guesse: Take that to teach thee more civillity. Exit Crying helpe. Sex. Out skellum one hundred towsan divel. Bert. Still fortune is against vs, this base fellow Will raise some tumult to betray our liues, Yet yonder comes a man of gravity, Enter Erasmus, &amp; others. It may be he can speake the Latine tongue, In that Ile let him vnderstand my griefe: Optime &amp; ornatissime vir, audi quÃ¦so. Eras. Quis es qui tot clamoribus, &amp; tanta exclamatione, Non modo Divinum Cenatorij locum irreverenter &amp; Orrose occupas, at vrbem tam claram cives? &amp; Senatores, Propter etates suas adoratissimas tam flactiose disturbas. Dutch. Si cum fronte tam generosa cor tuum humanum consentire Uidetur, infortunij nostri miserere. Era. Erasmus Roterodamus propter miserias vestras toto corde Dolet, colo perfectiones &amp; virtutes, quas intimo meo animo Complectar, multi pendo. Bert. Is this Erasmus borne in Roterdam, He that so highly lou'd Sir Thomas More? Erasm. Portate hanc ad domum Francisci de Ryvers alias Perecell Sic domino dominÃ¦? Erasmus Roterodamus omnibus Officijs est observantissimus. They beare her off in a Chayre. Exeunt. Finis Actus Tertij.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Enter Bertie. Bert. Within this towne hath Perecell a house, There, by the credit of this learned man We haue got harbor till the moneth expire, In which her heavy burthen may be eas'd, Good heaven looke downe vpon her misery, Comfort her in her griefe, strengthen her weakenesse, Lay not our woes to wretched Bonners charge, Free her sweete heaven, by thy Almighty hand, That we may once revisite our owne land. Enter Cranwell. Cranw. Now cheere your selfe deere sir, here is a time, To breath a space, this towne's a quiet port, From the tempestuous gusts of Bonners hate. Bart. Some refuge I confesse, but the distressed Dutches, In Child-bed torment is a fresh alarum Of new sprung care, I cannot be at quiet, Vntill her safe deliuery be past. Cran. Doubt not of that, the powerfull hand of heaven, In such extremities is ever strong. Bert. Good heaven, when I recount the miseries We haue already past, me thinkes the lottery Of cruell Fortune, should be quite exhaust, And yet when I record the name of Bonner, With his desire to become great by blood, The greater part of woe seemes still behind. Cran. Doubtlesse hees of a most pernitious spirit, But he that hath restrain'd his envious rage, And hitherto repulst him, still will curbe him. Bert. I trust he will, Cranwell I prethee step, And listen from the women what good newes. Enter Perecell, and Sands: Pere. Pray saue that labour, we can bring the newes. Bert. Welcome good Doctor Sands, What; in good health? Sands. Sir, thanks to heaven, who never leaues his owne Nor suffers them to perish in distresse. Bert. How fares the Dutches. Gentle host resolue me. Pere. Happy and well, cheere your declining thoughts, Well that her perillous conflict hath an end, And happy that to comfort her withall, Theres borne this day a young Lord Willobie. Bert. A Boy. Pere. A goodly Boy M. Bertie. And one in whom already doth appeare, These signes of Courage, to revenge your wrongs. Ber. Good heaven I thanke thee, This your newes deere friend, Is as a summons after death to life, the preservation Of his mother in travell, was wonderous strange, The place where he is borne is strange, The loving hands, that did first entertayne His presence to this pilgrimage of life, Are likewise strange, then as his birth hath bin, So shall his name, weele call him Peregrine. Sands. A stranger to his Countrey by that name, But by his deeds hereafter time may prooue, None more adventured for his Countreys loue. A Drumbeats a soft March. Ber. As it please his starres, but soft, What Drum is this, some galle I feare, To intermix our sweete, Some sorrow to confound this sudden ioy. Pere. Your servant Fox did vow to bring you word, If any hurt were secretly pretended. Ber. Is Fox arived, vpon what cause, Is Fox arived, vpon what cause Is he past over, doe you know gentle sir. Enter Fox. Pere. Himselfe make answer for himselfe. Fox. Sir, be not you dismayd, in breife these drums, And those that after these sad Musicke daunce, Are none that wish you, nor the Dutches good, A Captayne sent from England, and the bloodhound Clunie, With them the Duke of Brunswicke, clad in armes, And at the least, ten Ensignes after him, These how ere they vizard their intents, With other colour, as to vexe the Emperour, Yet their whole purpose, is to looke for you, The gates, and walls, are every way beset, And through the Towne, a privy search begun, And but you presently devise some meanes, To scape from hence, theyle take you in your lodging. Bertie. Escape, theres now no time to talke of scape, No, no, the secret providence of heaven, Hath so ordain'd, we should be Bonners thrall, And welcome wished death, the end of all. Sands. My mind presageth of a better speed, What M. Bertie, why not now escape, As well as heeretofore. Bertie. How can that be, The painefull Dutches, lying now in Child-bed. Sands. Is there no art, no meanes to blind their eyes. Fox. You are so many of you, tis impossible, Besides the Dutches, she cannot remooue. Bert. Oh, were she safe, I car'd not for my life. Sands. Nor I for mine. Fox. Nor I, had I ten thousand liues, Pere. Cease you your passions, my braine hath tutord me, And in a cunning plot shall set you free. Ber. Doe that, and Bertie is for ever thine. Fox. Fox, and his sword, for that will be thy slaue. Cranw. Thy friendship will I beare vnto my graue. San. What thou attempt'st, My prayers shall helpe to second. Pere. I neither doe expect thankes, nor reward, But what I doe is of meere charity, Then list vnto me, there's a friend of mine, A Countrey Gentleman, not far from hence, Whose brother late returned from the warres, And falling sicke, within the Citty heere, Dyed some few day as since, now this Gentleman, Because his brother shall be buried, Amongst his Ancestors, decrees this night, To haue his body in a Wagon brought, Home to the Parish Church, where he remaines, And for that purpose, hath his servant sent, To see if safe conveyd: A waggon like to theirs, Covered with blacke, shall be provided straight, Into the which, by helpe of Womens hands, The Dutches, and her Infant shall be lifted, You, and the rest disguis'd in mourning weeds, Shall follow after as the guard, And in the dead Mans name without suspect, Passe by the Souldiers, who if they chance, To question who you are, The Burgers being by, and made acquainted, With such a herce, that is to passe that way, Will quickly answer them, without more search, How like you this. Bert. It will I hope proue currant. Sands. The pretext is fit, and for the Dutches case: Fox. Fox has no more sence then a batle-doore, If in his iudgement, we already be not Delivered from the mischiefe of their hands. Pere. Come Ile provide you all things necessary. And after pray for your successe therein, Fox. Ile backe to them, and helpe you what I can. Exeunt Omnes. Enter Brunswick, L. Paget, Portgraue, Clunie, and Souldiers. Paget. Great Duke of Brunswick, this your flexible, And curteous disposition of your troopes, To be for Englands service, shall receaue The due belongeth to so great a merit. Bruns. Noble Captaine, I were much to be condemned, If I neglect my duty to the Church, But are you sure, these fugetiues are heere? Pag. Clunie, thou touldst me, that thou sawest a man Of theirs, since we beset the towne, wast true? Clu. Yes noble Captaine, Cranwell the Dutches vsher, And there's no question, but the rest are heere, Bru. Well then Captaine, the other Ports being garded, Heere with this company weele keepe our station, Where is the Portgraue? haue you sent abroad, Sufficient search amongst the private houses? Port. We haue my Lord. Bruns. They cannot be in Weasell, But either comming forth, or lurking heere, They must in all sorts be discovered by vs. Cap. Oh they are politick, and passing subtile, And if or art, or policie, can helpe them, There's in their company, an Instrument, Can plot a hundred waies for their escape. Brun. Let them expresse their cunning, if they can, And scape our hands, now we haue sented them. Enter Fox. Fox. How now my Lord, oh I am out of breath, In comming to you, yet I hope my hast, Is little for your purpose, they are comming, Stand on your guard, for this way they must passe, Ther's Bertie, Cranwell, Sands, with them the Dutches, Cap. Twas well done Fox, there's thy reward, stand close, Or, now, or never, let vs shew our care, stand, who goes there? Enter foure, bearing a Hearce, Bertie, Sands, Cranwell, Mourners. Bruns. Some funerall it seemes. Cap. It may be some device procured by them, So to escape the danger of our watch, stand. Port. I can assure your Lordship, tis not so, This is the body of young Vandermast, Whose brother dwelling some foure leagues from hence, Although he died heere, yet will haue him buried, Whereas his Ancestors are all intomb'd, And for that cause, hath sent his servants for him. Bruns. Is it no otherwise. Berty. No mighty Prince, And would to heaven it had not bin so now: Cap. Passe then, passe, it is not you we looke for. Exeunt they. Bruns. What was this Vandermast, a Cittizen? Port. No my good Lord, he was a Souldier, A proper Gentleman, and one had served The Emperour, and others in their warres, Yet was ordain'd, to end his dayes at home. Enter second Funerall. Bruns. A thing no more then vsuall, but how now, Whats here, an other funerall? nay then It is a hazzard, we are all deluded. Cap. My thoughts began to prophecie as much, Speake, are not you the parties that even now Came this way, with a mourning funerall. 1. Mour. Not we my Lord, this is the first appearance, We made this evening. Bruns. What haue you there conceal'd. 1. Mour. Nothing my Lord, but a dead body Coffin'd, The brother of our M. late deceast. Port. I, this is Vandermast, the other past, Vpon my life, was Barty, and the Dutches. Cap. They were vnwilling to looke vp me thought. Bruns: And he that spake, spake with a fained voice. Fox. Twas they, twas they, oh, I could teare my haire, To thinke we were so grossely overseene. Cap: I said as much, come let vs follow them, Send horsemen out, to every quarter straight, My Lord of Brunswick. Bruns: You need not bid me ride, This oversight, hath clapt wings to my thoughts. Exeunt all but Fox. Fox. Now for some pretty policy againe, To lead them forth the way, vntill the Dutches. May reach Polonia, and deserue the prize, Fox play thy part, some stratagem devise. Exit Fox. Enter Bonner, and Gardner. Bonn. Wher sits the winde, no newes from Germany? If those malitious fugitiues be tayne, Our officers I feare, neglect their charge, Our Captaine deales but coldly with the States. Gard. I dreamt my Lord, that Bertie and the Dutches, Were both advanc't vpon a regall throne, And had their temples wreath'd with glittering gold. Bon. That throne doe I interpret, is the stage Of horrid death, those wreathes of Gold, bright flames, That shall not onely circle in their browes, But wind about their bodies, till they waste, And be converted to a heape of ashes, Me thinks this worke of ours, goes slowly forward, The ayre of England freezeth for defect Of burning Meteors, to keepe it warme. Gard. See yet my Lord, there hath of late bin sacrific'd, In sundry places, many persons, of severall qualities, Whose names were tedious to relate. Bon. Tut this is nothing, every towne should blaze, And every streete, in every towne looke red, With glowing sinders of the Miscreants: Till like to Cockle, they were quite extinct, And nothing seene to florish but pure Corne: The morning spends apace, where are these knaues, Appointed to bring Fagots for the fire, Wherein bold Latimer, and Ridley must expire. Enter two with Fagots. Gard. They come my Lord. Bonner. Fye on you loytering knaues, Why make you not more hast, be gon, I say, And see the stake, and every thing be ready, See how I am still procrastinated, The Maior of Oxford, meanes to dyne I thinke, Before he bring the Prisoners to the stake, How now? where are they? Enter Sherife. Sherife. Hard at hand my Lord, But the weake age of Latimer is such, They cannot come so fast, as else they would, Besides some disputations as they passe, Had with the Schollers, hath detayn'd their speede. Bon. Ile haue no disputations, bring them on. Enter Latimer, and Ridley, with Halberds. Ridley. Come brother Latimer, lend me your arme, The weake, the weake, but not the blind, the blind, This day in Oxford, shall be seene to guide. Lati. My heart is iocund, brother Ridley, still, And in my Spirit, I flye vnto yon place, But these weake withered saplins are too blame, These legs of mine, that having now at least, Full fourescore and eight winters done me service, Should now deceaue me trust me, but my soule is Linct in charity, with all the world, I could be well content, to chide with them. Bon. These are those selfe iustifying Publicans, Away with them, conduct them to the fire. Gard. Come, come, spend no time in talke, Will you convert, be sorie for your crime, And you shall yet finde favor with the Queene. Bon. Fye, fye, spit at them, offer them no mercy. Ridley. Proceed in scorne, so was our Master vs'd, The servants are not better then their Lord. Bonn. Drag them away there, hence, away I say. Cranm. Stay, stay. Cranmer within. Bon. What voyce is that. Gard. Some one thats prisoner in Bocardo heere, Enter Cranmer. Cranm. Oh stay my Lords, whom leade you there to death? The reverent fathers, Ridley, and Latimer? Bon. I Cranmer, but more fauor rests for thee, Because thou are converted from thine errors. Cranm. Did you not tell me, they were likewise changed, And haue you falsely circumvented me? Oh heaven, forgiue my trayterous revolte, And you the chosen vessels of his loue, Deere Latimer, sweete Ridley pardon me, To make amends, Ile come and dye with you. Lati. As your revolt, graue Cranmer, was our griefe, So to heare these repentant gracefull words, Infuse our hearts with ioy, beyond compare. Bon. Will Cranmer then turne, and returne againe. Cranm, To turne to vertue never comes to late. Bon. Thy recantation vnderneath thy hand, Is publisht, and wilt thou now contradict it. Cranm. Bonner, to cut off needlesse circumstance, Let this declare my resolution, This hand that writ that faithlesse recantation, Since I am bard, from dying with my friends, Marke how I punish in this lingring flame, It shall burne off, as an assured signe, Heereafter of my constant Martyrdome, No scandall shall be left by my default, Open you heavens, and entertaine my willling sacrifice, Yet this is but an earnest of that loue, Heereafter shall in greater measure shine. Bon. Iaylor pull downe that scismatick, Lodge him within the dungeon, loade his ioynts With Iron fetters, let him fast from meate, And haue no comfort, but continuall checks, dispatch, I say. Cranm. Farewell religious mates, What earth doth separate, I hope ere long, Shall meet in heaven, spight of proud Bonners tongue. Rid. Farewell kind brother, nere decline no more, But follow vs, as we haue gone before. Laty. What stay we for, my quiet thoughts desire, To cloth this flesh, in purple robes of fire. Bon. You shall not neede to vrge our expedition, Leade them away, their Tragedy once ended, We will prepare attentiue eares to heare, Newes of the Dutches landing prisoner. Exeunt. Enter Dutches, and Bertie, with their Children. Dutches. Yet we haue scapt the danger of our foes, And I that whilom was exceeding weake, Through my hard travell in this infants birth, Am now growne strong vpon necessity, How forwards are we towards Windam Castle. Bert. Iust halfe our way, but we haue lost our friends, Through the hot pursute of our enemies. Dutch. We are not vtterly devoyd of friends, Behold the young Lord Willowby smiles on vs, And tis great helpe, to haue a Lord our Friend. Bert. Good heaven I pray once sorte to happy end, This dangerous Pilgrimage, heere vndertooke, Sit on this banke a while, and rest our limbes, Wearied with travaile, as our minds with care. Sits downe. Enter Fox, Clunie, Captaine, and Soldiers. Clu. You are a Captaine of the Palse graues band, These are the other recreants, ceaze them both, The hundred Crownes propos'd, are surely yours, I know him valiant, and therefore I will clyme Vp in this tree, to see, and not be seene, Pray lends a hand, whil'st you surprise them, I will laughing stand. Climbs vp the tree. Fox, If I sit you not, ere you come downe, Say Fox is a Goose. 2. Cap. Sir I attach you as an enemy Vnto the Palsegraue, in whose land you are, You and your Trull, obey it ye were best, Or in resistance hazzard both your liues. Ber. Attach me sir, I know no reason why, Nor to my knowledge am an enemy, Vnto the Palsgraue, or the meanest man Within his confines, we are Travellers, And will immediatly forsake the land. 2. Cap. You are a Launce knight, this your Concubine. And these your Bastards, that by rapine liue, And thus disguis'd you come to vndermine, Our Countries government, then yeeld your selues. Dutch. Though misery hath stampt vpon our brow The marke of poverty, yet gentle stranger, Doe not so far forget all manlinesse, To be a slanderer of the Innocent. 2. Cap. Terme me a slanderer. Bert. And a Villaine too, if thou maintayne these defamations, Terme me a Thiefe, my wife a Concubine, My Children base borne; by a souldiers faith, Wert thou the greatest spirit the Palesgraue hath, I cannot brooke this slavish insolence, That I am angry, witnesse this reply, I will defend mine honour though I dye. Strikes him. 2. Cap. Villaines I charge you all inviron him, They fight. Dutch. So many to one silly passenger, Then fatewell woman weakenes, welcome sword, For once Ile play the man, to saue my Lord. She fights, beates them off. Clu. Why this is excellent, now I hope to liue To see them apprehended or else slayne. Fox. These hopes Ile crosse, by cutting downe the branch Whereon he builds this weake foundation. cuts the branch Clu. Oh I shall fall, helpe me good M. Fox. Fox. I, wherefore Clunie, to betray my Lady? So hatefull Bonner, dived into the well, So fall this damned Parator to hell, And now Ile helpe my Mistris to my power, Fox, come out a your hole, and take your Cozens part Or Ile pull you out by the eares. cry within. Helpe, helpe, our Captaines murthered, raise the towne. Fox. The Captaine slaine, then Fox tis best to flie, And lest some sad mischance should second them, I will convey these Children to the Woods, That borders neere at hand, oh heaven I pray, Exit with children. Make this disasterous time a happy day. Cry within. Helpe, helpe, our Captaynes slayne. Clu. I must downe, blesse my necke and care not. Cry within. Follow, follow, follow. Clu. Oh, my guts, a vengeance on this Fox. Exit creeping. Cry within. This way, this way follow. Enter Berty, and Dutches. Dut. What cries are these, oh hast thou slaine the Cap. Bert. If he be slaine, require not heaven his blood, Of miserable Berty. Within. Helpe, helpe, helpe. Dut. A second volley of heart wounding words, Oh flye my loue, flye, flye, and saue thy life, Before the towne be rais'd, shift for your selfe, If you be taken, theres no way but death. Within. Heere, heere, this way. Dut. Why stir you not, our foes are hard at hand. Bert. I am so amaz'd I know not where to goe, Ile take this way. Dut. Rather deere Loue take this. Bert. That way they come. Dutch. What shall we doe, Behold a Ladder rais'd against this house, In happy time, mount vp and saue your life, I will defend the bottome with my sword, And though heaven knowes I am orelaid with woe, Ile rather dye then see your overthrow. Bert. But I shall leaue thee to thine enemies. Dutch. Shift for your owne life, take no care for mine, For heavens sake quickly, you delay the time. Bert. Feare lend me wings, but oh my griefs so great, It waies me downe, and I must needs retreat. Cry within. Come away, come away, ho! come away. Dutch, They are at hand, oh good my loue mount vp. Getts vp the Ladder. Enter Burgomaster, with Souldiers. Soul. See where they are that made the fray. Burg. You fellow, that run vp the Ladder, Downe, downe, or Ile pull you downe in a ropes name. Dut. He is my husband, and a Gentleman, And Ile defend him from your tyranie. Burg. A Woman fight. Dut. Such are my fortunes now, Therefore keepe off, who ventures on this way, Treadeth a path that leadeth to his death. Bert. My friends what seeke you, wherefore come you arm'd? Bur. You haue slaine a Captaine of the Palsgraues band, Wounded his souldiers, and besides we heare, You are a Lanceknight, this your Concubine, And come disguis'd to vndermine the State, In whose defence these men haue arm'd themselues. Bert. You seeme a Burgomaster, by your habit, And they that mis-inform'd you were too blame, Know gentle sir, I am an Englishman, And on some speciall busines bound this way, Toward Windam-Castle, till we were disturb'd, By the oppression of the man that's slayne. Burg. I wreake not friend of what estate you are, Nor to what end you travaile through these parts, You haue slaine a man, and you must answer it, According to the law of Nations. Soul. Downe with him, he shall answer it with death. Burg. Peace there, I charge you, in the Princes name. Bert. It seemes these men are thirsty for my blood, And without law are set to take my life, Then it were madnesse for a man to yeeld, To abide a triall; and the iudgement past: Since I must dye, Ile choose the death my selfe, And thats to stand on a defensiue guard, Except you sweare as you'r a Christian, A Magistrate, and one that will doe right, That I shall haue due processe of the Law And be defended from the multitude. Dutch. Doe not, I pray, indanger so your life, But trust vnto the shelter you haue got. Burg. A sorry fortresse to defend his life. Bert. But will you take that oath. Burg. By heaven I doe, and I will see it kept inviolate. Bert. Then worke the worst of fate, if right beare sway, He cannot speed amisse that does no wrong, Oh, innocence is bold, free, liberall, Fearelesse of any danger, that may fall, I yeeld me sir, a Prisoner to the law, Iustice is blind gaze not vpon our persons, Although our birth be neare so meane or base, But fixe the eye of iudgement on our case. Bur. So, bind their hands, &amp; lead them to the statehouse, They shall haue iustice done immediately, Dutch. Oh stay a while, I haue lost my little babes, What savadge hand hath tane my children hence, Whil'st we were busied in this lucklesse brawle. Bert. My Children borne away! oh then I feare, It is some treason to abridge our liues, And that the Captaine, that did wrong vs thus, Did it to that intent. Dutch. Tis so, till now we nere were truely miserable, Our other miseries were sunneshine dayes, Compar'd vnto the greatnesse of this storme, Oh suffer me good sir, to seeke them out, For without them, I am but halfe my selfe. Burg. A strict enquiry shall be made foorthwith, In every place that borders heere abouts, Greene not too much, though such are poore mens treasure, What needy thiefe to steale them would take pleasure. Exeunt Omnes. Finis Actus Quarti.</field>

Strangers, an please your excellence my Lord. That haue committed murder in your realme, Slaine Wisendrop a Captaine of your band, For which offence, our purpose is to lead them, vnto the State-house to receiue their iudgement. Erba. If I mistake not, I should know that face, Oh tis the vertuous Lady Katherine, This M. Berty, her espoused husband, And has your good starrs in your Pilgrimage, Brought you amongst you Friends? Pals. The Lady Katherine, what the Suffolks Dutches, My quondam Loue, haild through the streets with cords, And for the murther of a man that liues, Oh tis vncivill vsage, my good Lady, Yar villaines all vnto our Soveraigntie, How dare you thus abuse her royall birth. Burg. Pardon my Lord, we did not know her state. Pals. Her heavenly face, then which theres none more faire, In England, or the World, Might without other witnesse of her state, Suffice to tell you, she was nobly borne, This is that Dutches, mirror of this age, Shee whom the lordly Bishops of the Realme, Bonner, and Gardner, persecute so much, Pardon me Madam, that I haue so long, Suffered your excellence to stay in bonds. Dutc. This your acknowledgment, most mighty king, Amazeth me, considering my distresse, For tis a common custome in the world, To take no notice of the miserable. Pals. I stand amaz'd at this strange accident, The circumstance whereof weele heare elsewhere, Meane time thrice welcome to the Polands king, And much it greeues me that so great a Princes, Should be so basely handled in my land. Enter Sands, and Cranwell. Sand. Oh helpe deere Lord, and shield vs from our foes, We are pursued by Brunswicke, and his Captaines, Who seeke our liues, we flie to your protection. Pals.

Bert. It ill beseemes the noble duke of Brunswicke, To be a persecutor of good men. Dutch. Or you good Captaine, agent in this cause. 1. Cap. Thats recreant Berty, and the Suffolks Dutches, They likewise are included in this scroule. Bruns. My Lord of Poland, we demand them all, Then yeeld them royall sir, vnto our hands. Pals. First will I sacrifice ten thousand liues, Ere suffer these religious soules to dye, My Lord of Brunswicke, you are over bould, To make so rash an entrance in my land, Without our speciall licence granted first. Bruns. The league betwixt vs warrants my approach. Pals. The League, for this time, is your priveledge, But as you dread the Palsgraues puisance And feare to violate our wrighten loue, Immediately vntred your forward steps, Forsake the soyle where you haue set your foote, Or looke to be withstood with fire and sword, These Lambes are fled into our foulds for ayd, And weele defend them, say what may be sayd. Bruns. This disobedience drawes vpon your land, Deserved malediction from the Church. Pals. That weele dispence withall, and to let you know, How we doe slight those stinglesse menaces, Heere I create this noble Gentleman, Earle of Crozam, an Earledome vnder vs, Religious Docter Sands, our Chapleine, And M.

To stay the search? is our dread Soveraigne, Altered in her Religion, or is she dead: Atkin. Shee's dead good sir, Queene Mary is deceas't, And the most vertuous Lady Elizabeth, Invested in the regall dignity, My Soveraigne hearing, that the Lady Katherine, The Suffolke Dutches, her allie in blood, Did liue obscurely in these Provinces, In want, in misery, and great distresse, Sends to repeale both her, and all her friends, If such a Lady harbor in your land, I doe intreate her highnesse Proclamation, May haue his currant course through every towne. Pals. In you deere sir the Proclamation ends, Heere is the Dutches, here are all her friends. Dutch. I kindly thanke you, for your worthy paines, Hath the director of all humane liues, Preserv'd my Soveraigne, that heroicke Maide, From the intangling snares of blood and death, And chang'd her prison, to a royall Throne? Heere on this ground, where first I heard the newes, I render thanks vnto the gratious heavens, Thou that send'st Balme of comfort to the wounded, Ioy to the brused heart, opprest for truth, Lengthen her dayes as long as heaven hath starres, Or this faire frame foundation for a world, Or if it be thy gratious prouidence, For to remooue her to a happier place, Let in her stead arise, and from her ashes come, A Phenix may enlighten Christendome, Oh, had I now my Children lately lost, I should surviue as I had neere bin crost. Enter Fox, and Children. Fox. That comfort Madam on my bended knee, Your servant Fox humbly presents your grace. Dutch.

How comes it Fox, that he exclaimes on thee? Fox. Marry andt please your Maiestie, twas thus, This villanous rascall, followed to surprize my Lady, And being afraid to venter himselfe, set on one of the Palsegraues Captaines to doe it, whilst he climb'd Vp into a tree and stood laughing, now sir, I cut the bow, And he fell downe, and if you haue hot broake your necke, I would you had. Pals. If this be true, he has bought his pleasure deere, Sirra begon, this justice I allow, For his derision then, deride him now. Clu. All things goes backward for our good, Madam farewell, your punishment is past, Now set your mind to punish vs at last. Dutch. Revenge shall be a stranger in my heart, The tortures Ile inflict vpon my foes, Is kindnesse, for vnkindnesse, grace for death, For what's prosperity but a puffe of breath, My Lord of Brunswick, pray let vs be friends. Bru. Withall my heart, since every heart befriends you. Pals. It joyes me that your sorrowes heere take end, Wilt please you Madam, heere to stay with vs Or goe for England, if you so resolue, Ile see you furnish't with a noble fleete. Dutch. To England with full sailes, blow gentle wind, I long to see my Soveraigne noble mayd, Princes I humbly thanke you for these honors, Done to your handmaide, far vnworthie them, But time shall testifie my thankefulnesse, Be smooth rough sea, that I may passe amaine, To doe my duty to my Soveraigne.

But now they are deliver'd, and their place, Bonner, you must an other while supply, So saies the strict Commission I haue heere. Grind. Trust me, I glory not to see his fall. Story. Beleeue me, nor doe I. Cox. Though wee know, had not our Keeper bin more kind to vs. Then you were M. Bonner, we might here, Haue starv'd for want of meat, but heaven forgiue you, We doe with all our hearts. Scory. And we will labour too, so much as in vs lies, Vnto the Councell, you may be favorably Dealt withall, so fare you well. Exeunt. Bon. Farewell, this course inconstant fortune keepes, While wan one laughes, an other alwayes weeps. Exeunt. Enter Lord Hunsdon, Admirall, and Clinton. 1.

The kings-bench Madam, where all these prisoners, Are detayn'd for debt. Dutch. If they be able to make satisfaction, &amp; will not, They are worthy to lye there, But if by cruelty of Creditors, Tis Christian charity to succour such. Sands. I haue heard that some lie there in policy, And haue ingrost into their greedy hands, The goods of divers thrifty minded men, And though well able, yet they will not pay. Dutch. Great pitty that such men escape vnpunisht, But are they in the number that doe beg. Sands. No Madam, they are laid on beds of Downe, Fare daintely, and never tast of want, Except it be the want of Liberty, And that's no want, because they haue large walkes, As yards, and gardens, and faire bouling-allies. With company at will to spend the time. Dutch. To them we wish a better Conscence, But to the poore, and such as want indeed, One of you giue amongst them 40. Angels, My troubles make me sensible of theirs: Distresse is sharpely set, and bites too sore, To be indur'd by such as are true poore, So forwards Gentlemen. Fox. Roome for the Lords. Admi.

Hunsd. Your goods, and lands extracted violently, Her Maiestie restores to you againe, Heere's the true inventory of them all, As they were ceis'd into the Bishops hands. Admi. And that you may build on her Princely loue, It is her pleasure, M. Richard Berty, The husband of your troubles and your cares, Should be chiefe Secretary to the State, Till higher titles doe advance his worth. Bert. An honor my good Lord Admirall, That I esteeme, and yet desire it not, O be it not offensiue to her Grace, That I haue leaue to leade a private life, After my painefull travell in strange Lands. Adm. Enioy your minds contentment with your mind. Hun. You, Doctor Sands, her highnesse, and the Clergie, Doe consecrate Archbishop of Yorke. Sands. An honor far exceeding my desert. Clint.

This is the Prison of the Marshalsea, Chiefely pretended for her Highnesse household, But there are divers other prisoners. Enter Goseling. Dutch. Tis charity to helpe distressed men, Of what estate so ere, cause they be men, I leaue their faults respect vnto the Law, Giue them as much as the'ther Prisones, But what is he that with a downecast looke, Giues signes of discontentment. Gos. Madam I am a Prisoner heere, But ioy to see your Grace at liberty. Dutch. That face and voyce, I oft haue seene and heard, Did not you sometime make abode in Lee. Gos. Madam I did, and those that knew mee cald mee Goseling. Dutch. Then I am sure, you knew one Mistris White, This is the man that helpt me to escape, When we were neere beset with Bonners traynes. Cranw. It is my kinseman Madam, now I know him, What cause hath brought thee to this hard distresse. Gos. The cause even now aleaged. Dutch. Hath Bonner bin so cruell to my friend, Before mine eyelids weare the seale of sleepe, If heaven be pleas'd I will release thee Goseling. And pay thy charges to the vtmost farthing, Oh my deere friend, it never shall be said I was vngratefull, where I was befriended, And now his troubles make me call to mind, The faithfull dealing of my servant Fox, See Lords, a man whom I dismist my service, More through selfe-will, then any iust offence, Yet hath he quitted that disgrace so well, That I admire the strangenesse of his art, For Bonner vs'd him as a speciall meanes, To seeke my life, which oftentimes he sav'd, Paying my great vnkindnesse, with kind loue, Many such servants may this land afford, That vse their wits to such good purposes, Heere as a part of thy deserv'd reward, I freely giue thee a hundred pounds a yeere, And when I dye my land shall make it good. Fox. And when Fox failes you, let him dye in a ditch. Dutch. Gramercies gentle servant, now my Lords, Lets bend our pace towards famous London-Bridge, How pleasing is the prospect of the City, Now I haue bin fiue yeares a stranger heere, Thorow the same to White-hall to her grace, That I may see my loving Soveraignes face.
