      <field name="fulltext">TO HIS WORSHIPFVLL friende, and Kinseman, William Fleetewoode Esquier, Recorder of London.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The Argument of the whole Historye. In the Cyttie of Iulio (sometimes vnder the dominion of Coruinus Kinge of Hungarie, and Boemia) there was a law, that what man so euer commited Adultery, should lose his head, &amp; the woman offender, should weare some disguised apparrel, during her life, to make her infamouslye noted. This seuere lawe, by the fauour of some mercifull magistrate, became little regarded, vntill the time of Lord Promos auctority: who conuicting, a yong Gentleman named Andrugio of incontinency, condemned, both him, and his minion to the execution of this statute. Andrugio had a very vertuous, and beawtiful Gentlewoman to his Sister, named Cassandra: Cassandra to enlarge her brothers life, submitted an humble petition to the Lord Promos: Promos regarding her good behauiours, and fantasyng her great beawtie, was much delighted with the sweete order of her talke: and doyng good, that euill might come thereof: for a time, he repryu'd her brother: but wicked man, turning his liking vnto vnlawfull lust, he set downe the spoile of her honour, raunsome for her Brothers life: Chaste Cassandra, abhorring both him and his sute, by no perswasion would yeald to this raunsome. But in fine, wonne with the importunitye of hir brother (pleading for life:) vpon these conditions, she agreede to Promos. First that he should pardon her brother, and after marry her. Promos as feareles in promisse, as carelesse in performance, with sollemne vowe, sygned her conditions: but worse then any Infydel, his will satisfyed, he performed neither the one nor the other: for to keepe his aucthoritye, vnspotted with fauour, and to preuent Cassandraes clamors, he commaunded the Gayler secretly, to present Cassandra with her brothers head. The Gayler, with the outcryes of Andrugio, (abhorryng Promos lewdenes, by the prouidence of God, prouided thus for his safety. He presented Cassandra with a Felons head newlie executed, who (being mangled, knew it not from her brothers, by the Gayler, who was set at libertie) was so agreeued at this trecherye, that at the pointe to kyl her selfe, she spared that stroke, to be auenged of Promos. And deuisyng a way, she concluded, to make her fortunes knowne vnto the kinge. She (executinge this resolution) was so highly fauoured of the King, that forthwith he hasted to do Iustice on Promos: whose iudgement was, to marrye Cassandra, to repaire her crased Honour: which donne, for his hainous offence he should lose his head. This maryage solempnised, Cassandra tyed in the greatest bondes of affection to her husband, became an earnest suter for his life: the Kinge (tendringe the generall benefit of the c?mon weale, before her special ease, although he fauoured her much) would not graunt her sute. Andrugio (disguised amonge the company) sorrowing the griefe of his sister, bewrayde his safetye, and craued pardon. The Kinge, to renowne the vertues of Cassandra, pardoned both him, and Promos. The circumstances of this rare Historye, in action lyuelye foloweth.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus. 1. Scena. 1. Promos , Mayor, Shirife, Sworde bearer: One with a bunche of keyes: Phallax, Promos man. You Officers which now in Iulio staye, Know you our leadge, the King of Hungarie: Sent me Promos, to ioyne with you in sway: That styll we may to Iustice haue an eye. And now to show, my rule &amp; power at lardge, Attentiuelie, his Letters Pattents heare: Phallax, reade out my Soueraines chardge. Phal. As you commaunde, I wyll: giue heedefull eare. Phallax readeth the Kinges Letters Patents, which must be fayre written in parchment, with some great counterfeat zeale. Pro. Loe, here you see what is our Soueraignes wyl, Loe, heare his wish, that right, not might, beare swaye: Loe, heare his care, to weede from good the yll, To scoorge the wights, good Lawes that disobay. Such zeale he beares, vnto the Common weale, (How so he byds, the ignoraunt to saue) As he commaundes, the lewde doo rigor feele. Such is his wish, such is my wyll to haue: And such a Iudge, here Promos vowes to be. No wylfull wrong, sharpe punishment shall mysse, The simple thrall, shalbe iudgde with mercie, Each shall be doombde, euen as his merite is: Loue shall not staye, nor hate reuenge procure, Loue, hate and gaine, the causes of Iniustice. Ne yet shall Coyne, corrupt or foster wrong: I doo protest, whylste that my charge indure, For friende nor foe, to singe a partiall song. Thus haue you heard, howe my Commission goes, He absent, I present our Soueraigne styll: It aunsweres then, each one his dutie showes, To mee, as him, what I commaunde and wyll. Ma. Worthy Deputie, at thy chardge we ioye, We doe submitte our selues, to worke thy heast: Receyue the sword of Iustice to destroy, The wicked impes, and to defend the rest. Shri. Our Citty keyes, take wisht Liftenaunt heare, We doe committe our safetie to thy head: Thy wyse foresight, will keepe vs voyde of feare, Yet wyll we be assistant still at neede. Pro. Both Swoorde and Keies, vnto my Princes vse, I doo receyue and gladlie take my chardge. It resteth nowe, for to reforme abuse, We poynt a tyme, of Councell more at lardge, To treate of which, a whyle we wyll depart. Al speake. To worke your wyll, we yeelde a wylling hart. Exeunt. Scena. 2. Lamia , a Curtizane, entreth synging. The Song. Al a flaunt now vaunt it, braue wenche cast away care, With Layes of Loue chaunt it, for no cost see thou spare: Sith Nature hath made thee, with bewty most braue, Sith Fortune doth lade thee, with what thou wouldst haue. Ere Pleasure doth vade thee, thy selfe set to sale: All wantons wyll trade thee, and stowpe to thy stale. All a flaunt, Ut Supra.

All a flaunt, Ut Supra: Triumphe fayre Lamia now, thy wanton flag aduaunce, Shee speaketh. Set foorth thy selfe to brauest show, bost thou of happy chaunce: Gyrle, accompt thou thy selfe the cheefe, of Lady Pleasures traine, Thy face is faire, thy forme c?tent, thy Fortunes both doth staine. Euen as thou wouldst, thy house doth stande, thy furniture is gay, Thy weedes are braue, thy face is fine, &amp; who for this doth paye? Thou thy self? no, the rushing Youthes, yt bathe in wanton blisse, Yea, olde and dooting fooles sometimes, doo helpe to paye for this. Free cost betweene them both I haue, all this for my behoue, I am the sterne, yt gides their thoughts, looke what I like, they loue Few of them sturre, that I byd staie, if I bid go, they flye: If I on foe pursue reuenge, Alarme a hundred crye. The brauest I their harts, their handes, their purses holde at wyl, Ioynde with the credite of the best, to bowlster mee in yll. But see wher as my trustie man, doth run, what newes brings he? Scena. 3. Rosko (Lamias man) Lamia. Ros. Good people, did none of you, my mistresse Lamia see? La. Rosko, what newes, that in such haste you come blowing? Ros. Mistresse, you must shut vp your shops, &amp; leaue your occupying. La. What so they be, foolish knaue, tell mee true? Ros, Oh yll, for thirtie? besydes you. La. For mee good fellowe, I praye thee why so? Ros. Be patient Mistresse, and you shall knowe, La. Go too, saye on: Ros, Marrie, right nowe at the Sessions I was, And thirtie must to Trussum corde go. Among the which (I weepe to showe) alas: La. Why, what's the matter man? Ros. O Andrugio, For louing too kindlie, must loose his heade, And his sweete hart, must weare the shamefull weedes: Ordainde for Dames, that fall through fleshly deedes. La. Is this offence, in question come againe? Tell, tell, no more, 'tys tyme this tale were done: See, see, howe soone, my triumphe turnes to paine. Ros. Mistresse, you promised to be quiet, For Gods sake, for your owne sake, be so La. Alas poore Rosko, our dayntie dyet, Our brauerie and all we must forgo. Ros. I am sorie. La. Yea, but out alas, sorrowe wyll not serue: Rosko, thou must needes prouide thee else where, My gaynes are past, yea, I my selfe might starue: Saue that, I did prouide for a deare yeare. Ros. They rewarde fayre (their haruest in the stacke,) When winter coms, that byd their seruaunts packe. Alas Mistresse, if you turne mee off now, Better then a Roge, none wyll me allowe. La. Thou shalt haue a Pasporte, Ros. Yea, but after what sorte? La. Why, that thou wart my man. Ros. O the Iudge, sylde showes the fauour, To let one theefe, bayle another: Tush I know, ere long you so wyll slyp awaye, As you, for your selfe, must seeke some testimony Of your good lyfe. La. Neuer feare: honestly Lamia nowe meanes to lyue, euen tyll she dye. Ros. As iumpe as Apes, in vewe of Nuttes to daunce, Kytte wyll to kinde, of custome, or by chaunce: Well, howe so you stande vpon this holy poynt, For the thing you knowe, you wyll ieobarde a ioynt. La. Admitte I woulde, my hazarde were in vaine. Ros. Perhappes I know, to turne the same to gaine. La. Thou comforts mee, good Rosko, tell mee howe? Ros. You wyl be honest, 'twere syn to hinder you. La. I dyd but ieast, good sweete seruaunt tell mee. Ros. Sweete seruaunt now, and late, pack syr, god bwy ye. La. Tush, to trye thy vnwillingnesse, I dyd but ieast. Ros. And I doo but trye, how long you woulde be honest. La. I thought thy talke was too sweete to be true. Ros. Yea, but meant you, to byd honestie adue? La. No, I dyd so long since, but inforste by neede, To byd him welcome home againe, I was decreede. Ros. Uerie good, Mistresse, I know your minde, And for your ease, this remedie I finde: Prying abroade, for playe fellowes and such, For you Mistresse, I hearde of one Phallax, A man esteemde, of Promos verie much: Of whose Nature, I was so bolde to axe, And I smealt, he lou'd lase mutton well. La. And what of this? Ros. Marry of this, if you the waye can tell To towle him home, he of you wyll be fayne: Whose countenaunce, wyll so excuse your faultes, As none for life, dare of your lyfe complaine. La. A good deuice, God graunt vs good successe: But I praye thee, what trade doth he professe? Ros. He is a paltrie petyfogger. La. All the better, suspition wyll be the lesse. Well, go thy wayes, and if thou him espye, Tell him from mee, that I a cause or two, Woulde put to him, at leysure wyllinglie. Ros. Hir case is so common, that smal pleading wyl serue, I go (nay ronne) your commaundement to obserue. The scurge of lawe (and not zeale) keepeth the lewde in awe. La. Aye me alas, lesse Phallax helpe, poore wench vndone I am: My foes nowe in the winde, wyll lye to worke my open shame: Now enuious eyes will prie abroade, offenders to intrap, Of force now Lamia, must be chaste, to shun a more mishap. And wanton girle, how wilt thou shift, for garments fine and gay? For dainty fare, can crusts c?tent? who shal thy houserent pay? And that delights thee most of all, thou must thy daliaunce leaue? And can then the force of lawe, or death, thy minde of loue bereaue?

The onely meane, God wot, that should our house aduaunce, Who in the hope of his good hap, must dy through wanton chance: O blynde affectes in loue, whose tormentes none can tell, The force of loue.Yet wantons wyll hyde fyre, and frost, yea hassard death, nay hell: To taste thy sowre sweete frutes, digested styll with care, Fowle fall thee loue, thy lightning ioyes, hath blasted my welfare Thou fyerst affection fyrst, within my brothers brest. Thou mad'st Polina gra?t him (earst) euen what he would request: Thou mad'st him craue and haue, a proofe of Venus meede, For which foule act he is adiudgd, eare long to lose his heade. The lawe is so seuere, in scourging fleshly sinne, As marriage to worke after mends doth seldome fauor win. A law first made of zeale, but wrested much amis. Faults should be measured by desart, but all is one in this, A good lawe yll executed, The lecher fyerd with lust, is punished no more, Then he which fel through force of loue, whose mariage salues his sore: So that poore I dispayre, of my Andrugios lyfe, O would my dayes myght end with his, for to appease my stryfe.

Condempned wretch to see thee here, fast fettered now in Iayle, How haps thy wits were witched so, yt knowing death was meede Thou wouldest commit (to slay vs both) this vile laciuious deede. An. O good Cassandra, leaue to check, and chide me thraule therfore If late repentaunce, wrought me helpe I would doe so no more. But out alas, I wretch, too late, doe sorrowe my amys, Unles Lord Promos graunt me grace: in vayne is hadywist, Wherfore sweete sister, whylst in hope, my d?pned lyfe yet were, Assaulte his hart, in my behalfe, with battering tyre of teares. If thou by sute doest saue my lyfe, it both our ioyes will be, If not it may suffice thou soughst, to set thy brother free: Wherefore speede to proroge my dayes, to morrowe else I dye. Cas. I wyll not fayle to pleade and praye, to purchase the mercye, Farewell awhyle, God graunte mee well to speede. An. Syster adew, tyl thy returne, I lyue, twene, hope, and dreede. Cas.

Promos with the Shriefe and their Officers. Pro. Tis strange to thinke, what swarms of vnthrifts liue, Within this towne, by rapine spoyle and theft: That were it not, that Iustice ofte them greeue, The iust mans goods, by Ruflers should be reft. At this our Syse, are thirty iudgde to dye, Whose falles I see, their fellowes smally feare: So that the way, is by seuerity, Such wicked weedes, euen by the rootes to teare: Wherefore Shriefe, execute with speedy pace, The dampned wightes, to cutte of hope of Grace. Shriefe. It shalbe done. Cassandra to hir selfe, Cas. O cruell words they make my hart to bleede, Now, now, I must, this dome seeke to reuoke, Least grace come short, when starued is the steede: She kneeling speakes to Promos. Most mighty Lord, &amp; worthy Iudge, thy iudgem?t sharpe abate, Uaile thou thine eares, to heare the plaint, that wretched I relate, Behold the wofull Syster here, of poore Andrugio, Whom though that lawe awardeth death, yet mercy do him show: Way his yong yeares, the force of loue, which forced his amis, Way, way, that Mariage, works amends, for what committed is, He hath defilde no nuptial bed, nor forced rape hath mou'd, He fel through loue, who neuer ment, but wiue ye wight he lou'd. And w?tons sure, to keepe in awe, these statutes first were made, Or none but lustfull leachers, should, with rygrous law be payd. And yet to adde intent thereto, is farre from my pretence, I sue with teares, to wyn him grace, that sorrows his offence. Wherefore herein, renowned Lorde, Iustice with pitie payse: Which two in equal ballance waide, to heau? your fame will raise. Pro. Cassandra, leaue of thy bootlesse sute, by law he hath bene tride, Lawe founde his faulte, Lawe iudgde him death: Cas. Yet this maye be replide, That law a mischiefe oft permits, to keepe due forme of lawe, That lawe small faultes, with greatest doomes, to keepe men styl in awe: Yet Kings, or such as execute, regall authoritie: If mends be made, may ouer rule, the force of lawe with mercie. Here is no wylful murder wrought, which axeth blood againe, Andrugios faulte may valued be, Mariage wipes out his stayne. Pro. Faire Dame, I see ye naturall zeale, thou bearest to Andrugio, And for thy sake (not his desart) this fauour wyll I showe: I wyll repriue him yet a whyle, and on the matter pawse, To morrowe you shall lycence haue, a fresh to pleade his cause: Shriefe execute my chardge, but staye Andrugio, Untill that you in this behalfe, more of my pleasure knowe. Shri. I wyll performe your wyll: Cas. O most worthy Magistrate, my selfe thy thrall I finde, Euen for this lytle lightning hope, which at thy handes I finde. Now wyl I go and comfort him, which hangs twixt death &amp; life. Exit. Pro. Happie is the man, that inioyes the loue of such a wife, I do protest, hir modest wordes, hath wrought in me a maze. Though she be faire, she is not deackt, with garish shewes for gaze, Hir bewtie lures, hir lookes cut off, fond sutes with chast disdain. O God I feele a sodaine change, that doth my freedome chayne. What didst thou say? fie Promos fie: of hir auoide the thought, And so I will, my other cares wyll cure what loue hath wrought, Come awaye. Exeunt. Scena. 4.

And thinke reward, there seruice iust, with offred shifts wyl bayght When they (poore soules) in froth do falle a myle vpon account, For flattery and feruent plesing, are meanes to make men mount: I speake on proofe, Lord Promos, I haue pleased many a day, Yet am I neither learned, true, nor honest any way. What skyls for that, by wit or wyle, I haue an office got, By force wherof euery lycence, warrant, pattent, pasport, Leace, fyne, fee, et cetera, pas and repas, through Phallax bands, Disordred persons brybe me wel, to escape from Iustice hands, And welthy churles for to promote, I now haue set a worke, Such hungry lads, as soone will smell, where statute breakers lurk, And if they come, within our Grype, we meane to stripe them so, As (if they scape from open shame) their bagges with vs shall goe. And trust me this, we officers, of this mylde mould are wrought, Agree with vs, and sure your shame by vs shal not be sought: But soft a whyle, I see my Lord what makes him lowre so?

Fayre Ladyes O, no Lady is my loue, And yet she sure, as coye as they wyl proue. Phal. I thought as much, loue dyd torment you so. But what is she that dare saye Promos noe? Pro. Doe what one can, fyre wyll breake forth I see, My words vnwares, hath showen what greeueth mee: My wound is such, as loue must be my leache, Which cure wyll bryng, my Grauity in speeche, For what maye be, a folly of more note, Then for to see, a man gray heard to dote. Phal. No my Lorde, Amor omnia vincit, And Ouid sayth, Forma numen habet. And for to proue, loues seruice seemes the wise, Set Sallamon and Sampson, before your eyes: For wyt, and strength, who wonne the cheefest prise. And both lyu'd by the lawes loue did deuise, Which proues in loue, a certaine godhed lyes. And Goddes rule yearely, by wisdome from the skyes: Whose wyls (thinke I) are wrought best by the wise. In deede diuine, I thinke loues working is, From reasons vse, in that my sences swarue, In pleasure paine, in payne I fynde a blysse, On woe I feede, in sight of foode I stearue: These strange effects, by loue are lodgd in mee, My thoughts are bound, yet I my selfe am free. Phal. Well my Good Lord, I axe (with pardon sought) Who she may be, that hath your thrauldome wrought? Pro. The example is such, as I sygh to showe, Syster she is, to dampned Andrugio. Phal. All the better for you the game doth goe. The prouerbe sayth, that kyt wyll vnto kinde, If it be true this comfort, then I fynde: Cassandras flesh is as her brothers, frayle, Then wyll shee stoupe, (in cheefe) when Lords assayle. Pro. The contrary (through feare) doth worke my payne, For in her face, such modesty doth raigne, As cuttes of louing sutes, with chaste disdayne. Phal. What loue wyll not, necessity shall gayne, Her brothers lyfe, will make her glad and fayne. Pro. What is it best, Andrugio free to set, Ere I am sure, his systers loue to gette? Phal. My louyng Lord, your seruaunt meanes not so, But if you will, else where in secret goe: To worke your wyll, a shift I hope to showe. Pro.

But I maruell much poore slaues, that they are hanged so soone, They were wont, to staye a day or two, now scarce an after noone: All the better for the hangman, I pardons dreaded sore, Would cutters saue, whose clothes are good, I neuer feard the poore: Let mee see, I must be dapper in this my facultie, Heare are new ropes, how are my knots, I faith syr slippery. At fast or loose, with my Giptian, I meane to haue a cast: Tenne to one I read his fortune by the Marymas fast, Serg. A way, what a stur is this, to see men goe to hanging? Han.

Do what I can, no reason cooles desire, The more I striue, my fonde affectes to tame: The hotter (oh) I feele, a burning fire Within my breast, vaine thoughts to forge and frame. O straying effectes, of blinde affected Loue, From wisdomes pathes, which doth astraye our wittes: Which makes vs haunt, that which our harmes doth moue, A sicknesse lyke, the Feuer Etticke fittes: Which shakes with colde, when we do burne like fire. Euen so in Loue, we freese, through chilling feare, When as our hartes, doth frye with hote desire: What saide I? lyke to Etticke fittes, nothing neare: In sowrest Loue, some sweete is euer suckt.

And rest vnsure, of hir I wish to haue, I knowe not if Cassandra loue, or no? But yet admytte, she graunt not what I craue, If I be nyce, to hir brother lyfe to giue: Might masters right.Hir brothers life, too much wyll make hir yeelde, A promise then, to let hir brother lyue: Hath force inough, to make hir flie the fielde. Thus though sute fayle, necessitie shall wyn, Of Lordlie rule, the conquering power is such: But (oh sweete sight) see where she enters in, Both hope and dreade, at once my harte doth tuch. Scena. 2.

See, as I wisht, Lord Promos is in place, Nowe in my sute, God graunt I maye finde grace. Renowned Lorde, whylst life in me doth last, Shee kneeling speaks to Promos. In homage bondes, I binde my selfe to thee: And though I did thy goodnesse latelie taste, Yet once againe, on knees I mercie seeke: In his behalfe, that hanges twene death and life, Who styll is preast, if you the mendes do leeke: His lawles loue, to make his lawfull wife. Pro. Faire Dame, I wel haue wayd thy sute, &amp; wish to do thee good, But all in vaine, al things conclude, to haue thy brothers blood: The stricknes of the lawe condempnes, an ignoraunt abuse, Then wylfull faultes are hardlie helpt, or cloked with excuse: And what maye be more wylfull, then a Maide to violate. Cas. The force was smal, when with hir wyl, he wretch ye conquest gate. Pro. Lawe euer at the worst, doth conster euyl intent. Cas. And lawe euen with the worst, awardes them punishment: And sith that rigorous lawe adiudgd him to dye, Your glorie will be much the more, in showing him mercie. The world wil think, how yt you do, but gra?t him grace on cause, And where cause is, there mercy should abate the force of lawes. Pro. Cassandra in thy brothers halfe, thou hast sayde what may be And for thy sake, it is, if I doe set Andrugio free: Short tale to make, thy beauty hath, surprysed mee with loue, That maugre wit, I turne my thoughts, as blynd affections moue. And quite subdude by Cupids might, neede makes mee sue for grace To thee Cassandra, which doest holde, my freedome in a lace. Yeelde to my will, and then commaund, euen what thou wilt of mee, Thy brothers life, and all that else, may with thy liking gree. Cas. And may it be, a Iudge himself, the selfe same fault should vse: Cass?dra to hir self. For which he domes, an others death, O crime without excuse. Renowned Lorde, you vse this speach (I hope) your thrall to trye, If otherwise, my brothers life, so deare I will not bye. Pro. Faire Dame my outward looks, my inward thoughts bewray, If you mistrust, to search my harte, would God you had a kaye. Cas.

UUhat so warre seekes, loue vnto warre, contrary is, you see. Hate fostreth warre, loue cannot hate, then maye it couet force. Pro. The Louer ofte sues to his foe, and findeth no remorse: Then if he hap to haue a helpe, to wyn his frowarde foe, Too kinde a foole, I will him holde, that lets such vantage goe. Cas. Well, to be short, my selfe wyll dye, ere I my honor staine, You know my minde, leaue off to tempt, your offers are in vaine. Pro. Bethink your self, at price inough I purchase sweet your loue, Andrugios life suffis'd alone, your straungenes to remoue: The which I graunt, with any wealth that else you wyll require, Who buyeth loue at such a rate, payes well for his desire. Cas. No Promos, no, honor neuer at value maye be solde, Honor farre dearer is then life, which passeth price of golde: Pro. To buie this Iuell at the full, my wife I may thee make: Cas.

That which to others c?fort yeelds, doth cause my heuy cheer, I meane my beautie breedes my bale, which many hold so deere. I woulde to God that kinde else where, bestowed had this blase, My vertues then had wrought regard, my shape now giues ye gase: This forme so Promos fiers with Loue, as wisdom can not quench, His hote desire, tyll he lust, in Venus seas hath drencht.

Sweete, show the cause, I must this dome indure? Cas. If thou dost liue I must my honor lose, Thy raunsome is, to Promos fleshly wyll That I do yelde: then which I rather chose, With torments sharpe, my selfe he first should kyll: Thus am I bent, thou seest thy death at hand, O would my life, would satisfie his yre, Cassandra then, would cancell soone thy band. An. And may it be a Iudge of his account, Can spot his minde, with lawles loue or lust? But more, may he doome any fault with death? When in such faute, he findes himselfe iniust. Syster, that wise men loue we often see, And where loue rules, gainst thornes doth reason spurne. But who so loues, if he reiected be, His passing loue, to peeuish hate will turne. Deare sister then, note how my fortune stands, That Promos loue, the like is oft in vse: And sith he craue, this kindnesse, at your hands, Thinke this, if you his pleasure do refuse. I in his rage (poore wretch) shall sing Peccaui. Here are two euyls, the best harde to digest, But where as things are driuen vnto necessity, There are we byd, of both euyls choose the least: Cas. And of these euils, the least, I hold is death, To shun whose dart, we can no meane deuise, Yet honor lyues, when death hath done his worst, Thus fame then lyfe is of farre more emprise: An. Nay Cassandra, if thou thy selfe submyt, To saue my life, to Promos fleashly wyll, Iustice wyll say, thou dost no cryme commit: For in forst faultes is no intent of yll. Cass. How so th'intent, is construed in offence, The Prouerbe saies, that tenne good turnes lye dead, And one yll deede, tenne tymes beyonde pretence, By enuious tounges, report abrode doth spread: Andrugio so, my fame, shall vallewed bee, Dispite wyll blase my crime, but not the cause: And thus although I fayne would set thee free, Poore wench I feare, the grype of slaunders pawes. An. Nay sweete sister more slaunder would infame, Your spotles lyfe, to reaue your brothers breath: When you haue powre, for to enlarge the same, Once in your handes, doth lye my lyfe, and death. Way that I am, the selfe same flesh you are, Thinke I once gone, our house will goe to wrack: Knowe forced faultes, for slaunder neede not care: Looke you for blame, if I quaile through your lack. Consider well, my great extremitie, If other wise, this doome I could reuoke: I would not spare, for any ieberdye: To free thee wench, from this same heauy yoke. But ah I see, else, no way saues my life. And yet his hope, may further thy consent, He sayde, he maye percase make thee his wife, And t'is likelie, he can not be content With one nights ioye: if loue he after seekes, And I dischargd, if thou aloofe then be, Before he lose thy selfe, that so he leekes, No dought but he, to marryage, wyll agree. Cas. And shall I sticke to stoupe, to Promos wyll, Since my brother inioyeth lyfe thereby? No, although it doth my credit kyll, Ere that he should, my selfe would chuse to dye. My Andrugio, take comfort in distresse, Cassandra is wonne, thy raunsome great to paye, Such care she hath, thy thraldome to releace: As she consentes, her honor for to slay. Farewell, I must, my virgins weedes forsake: And lyke a page, to Promos lewde repayre. Exit. An. My good sister to God I thee betake, To whome I pray, that comforte change thy care. Scena. 5.

The quietest, and the thryftiest course they say, Is, not to checke, but prayse great mens amys, I finde it true, for soothing Promos vaine: None lyke my selfe, is lykte in his conceyte, While fauour last, then good, I fish for gaine: (For Grace wyll not byte alwayes at my bayte) And as I wish, at hande, good Fortune, see: Here coms Phallax, and Gripax, but what's this, As good, as fayre handsell, God graunt it bee: The knaues bring a Woman, Coram nobis.

What meanes these knaues to scolde. Ra. Maister Phallax, we finde you in good time, A VVoman here, we haue brought afore you: One to be chargde with many a wanton crime. Which tryall will, with proofe inough finde true: A knaue of hirs, we haue stayed likewise, Both to be vs'd, as you shall vs aduise. Phal. What call you hir name? Ra. Lamia. Phal. Faire Dame, hereto what do you saye? La. Worshipfull Sir, my selfe I happy reake, UUith patience that my aunswer you will heare: These naughtie men, these wordes on mallice speake, And for this cause, yll wyll to me they beare. I scornde to keepe, their mindes with money playe, I meane to keepe, my life from open shame, Yea, if I lyu'd, as lewdlie as they saye: But I that knewe, my selfe vnworthy shame: Shrunk not, to come vnto my triall nowe, My tale is tolde, conceyue as lyketh you. Phal. My friends, what proofe haue you against this dame? Speake on sure ground, least that you reape the shame: The wrong is great, and craues great recompence. To touch her honest name, without offence. Gri. All Iulio Syr doth ryng of her lewd lyfe: Byl. In deede she is knowne for an ydle huswife. Ros. He lyes, she is occupied day and night. Phal. To sweare against her is there any wight? Ra. No, not present, but if you do detayne her, There wilbe found by oth, some that wyll stayne her, Phal. I see she is then on suspition stayde: Whose fawltes to search, vpon my charge is layde, From charge of her I therfore will set you free, My selfe will search her faultes if any be, A Gods name you may depart. 2 or. 3. speake, God bwy Syr. Gri. In such shares as this, henceforth I will begin, For all is his, in his clawes, that commeth in. Exeunt. Phal. Fayre Lamia, since that we are alone, I plainely wyll discourse to you my minde, I thinke you not to be so chast a one, As that your lyfe, this fauor ought to fynde: No force, for that, since that you scot free goe, Unpunished, whose life is iudged yll: Yet thinke (through loue) this grace the Iudge doth show, And loue with loue ought to be answered styll. La. Indeede I graunt (although I could reproue, Their lewde Complayntes, with goodnesse of my lyfe) Your curtesy, your detter doth me proue, In that you tooke (my honest fame in stryfe,) My aunswere for discharge of their report: For which good turne, I at your pleasure rest, To worke amends, in any honest sort: Phal. Away with honesty, your answeare then in sooth, Fyts me as iumpe as a pudding a Friars mouth, Ros. He is a craftie childe, dally, but do not. La. Tush, I warrant thee, I am not so whot, Your wordes are too harde Sir, for me to conster. Phal. Then to be short, your rare bewtie my hart hath wounded so, As (saue your loue, become my leach) I sure shall die with woe. La. I see no signe of death, in your face to appeare, Tis but some vsuall qualme you haue, pitifull Dames to feare. Phal. Faire Lamia, trust me I faine not, betimes bestow som grace. La. Well, I admit it so, onelie to argue in your case. I am maried, so that to set your loue on me were vaine: Phal. It suffiseth me, that I may your secrete friend remaine. Ros. A holie Hoode, makes not a Frier deuoute, He will playe at small game, or he sitte out. La. Though for pleasure, or to proue me, these profers you do moue, You are to wise, to hassarde life, vpon my yeelding loue: The man is painde with present death, that vseth wanton pleasure. Phal. To scape such paine, wise men, these ioyes, without suspect c? measure. Furthermore, I haue ben (my Girle) a Lawier to too l?g: If at a pinche, I cannot wrest the Law from right to wrong. La. If lawe you do professe, I gladlie craue, In a cause or two, your aduise to haue. Phal. To resolue you, you shall commaunde my skyll, Wherfore like friendes, lets common in good wyll. La. You are a merie man, but leaue to ieast, To morrowe night, if you will be my Geast: At my poore house, you shall my causes knowe, For good cause, which I meane not here to showe. Phal. Willinglie, and for that, haste calles me hence, My sute tyll then, shall remaine in suspence: Farewell Clyent, to morrow looke for me: Exit. La. Your good welcome Sir, your best cheere will be. Ros. I tolde you earst, the nature of Phallax, Money, or faire Women, workes him as waxe: And yet I must commend your sober cheere, You tolde your tale, as if a Saint you were. La. Well (in secreete, be it sayde) how so I seemd diuine, I feared once, a blew gowne, would haue bene my shrine. But nowe that paine is flead, and pleasure keepes his holde, I knowe that Phallax will, my Fame henceforth vpholde: To entertaine which Geast, I will some dayntie cheere prepare, Yet ere I go, in pleasant Song, I meane to purge my care. The Song. Adue poore care, adue, Go, cloye some helples wretche: My life, to make me rue, Thy forces do not stretche. Thy harbor, is the harte, Whom wrong, hath wrapt, in woe. But wrong, doth take my parte, VVith cloke of right in shoe. My faultes, inquirie scape, At them the Iudges winke: Those for my fall that gape, To showe my lewdnesse shrinke. Then silly care go packe, Thou art no Geast for mee: I haue, and haue, no lacke, And lacke, is shrowde for thee. Exeunt. Scena. 7. Cassandra, apparelled like a Page. Cas. Unhappy wretche, I blush my selfe to see, Apparelled thus monstrous to my kinde: But oh, my weedes, wyll with my fault agree, When I haue pleasde, lewde Promos fleshlie minde. What shall I doo, go proffer what he sought? Or on more sute, shall I giue my consent? The best is sure, since this must needes be wrought: I go, and showe, neede makes me to his bent. My fluddes of teares, from true intent which floe. Maye quenche his lust, or ope his musled eyen, To see that I deserue to be his wife: Though now constrainde to be his Concubine. But so, or no, I must the vent er giue, No daunger feares the wight, prickt foorth by neede: And thus lyke one more glad to dye, then lyue, I forewarde set, God graunt me well to speede.

A luckie friende (yea, one that beareth swaye) Is nowe become, a proppe, of such a staye To hir good name, as who is he dare saye: That Lamia doeth offende, nowe any waye?

Promos alone. Pro. By proofe I finde, no reason cooles desire, Cassandraes sute, suffised to remoue My lewde request, but contrarie, the fire, Hir teares inflam'd, of lust, and filthy Loue. And hauing thus, the conquest in my handes, No prayer seru'de to worke restraint in mee: But needes I woulde vntye the precious bandes, Of this fayre Dames spotles Uirginitie. The spoyle was sweete, and wonne euen as I woulde, And yet vngainde, tyll I had giuen my trothe, To marie hir, and that hir brother shoulde Be free from death, all which I bounde with oathe: It resteth nowe (vnlesse I wrong hir much) I keepe my vowe: and shall Andrugio lyue? Such grace woulde mee, with vnindifferencie tuch. To pardon him, that dyd commit a Rape, To set him free, I to Cassandra sware: But no man else, is priuie to the same, And rage of Loue, for thousande oathes nyll spare, More then are kept, when gotten is the game. Well, what I sayde, then Louer like I sayde, Nowe reason sayes, vnto thy credite looke: And hauing well, the circumstaunces wayde, I finde I must, vnsweare the oathe I tooke: But double wrong, I so should do Cassandra.

For louers feare not how they sweare, to wyn a Lady fayre, And hauing wonne what they did wish, for othes nor Lady care, But be he iust or no, I ioy Andrugio yet shall lyue, But ah, I see a sight, that doth my hart a sunder ryue.

Alas his hasty pace to me, showes some what is amys. Gay. Fayre Cassandra my Lord Promos, commends him vnto thee, To keepe his word, who sayes from prison he sends thy brother free. Cas.

I sure had showen what I had done, her teares I pittied so, But that I wayde, that women syld, do dye with greefe and woe, And it behoues me to be secret or else my neck verse cun, Well now to pack my dead man hence, it is hye tyme I run. Cas. Is he past sight, then haue I time to wayle my woes alone, Andrugio, let mee kis thy lippes, yet ere I fall to mone. O would that I could wast to teares, to wash this bloddy face, Which fortune farre beyond desart hath followed with disgrace. O Promos falce, and most vnkinde, both spoyld of loue and ruth, O Promos thou dost wound my hart, to thinke on thy vntruth, Whose plyghted fayth, is tournd to frawd, &amp; words to works vniust Why doe I lyue vnhappy wench, syth treason quites my trust, O death deuorse me wretch at once, from this same worldly lyfe, But why do I not slay my selfe, for to appease thys stryfe? Perhaps within this wombe of myne, an other Promos is: I so by death shalbe auengd of him in murthring his, And ere I am assured that, I haue reuengd this deede, Shall I dispatch my lothed life? that hast, weare more then speede, So Promos would triumphe that none his Tiranny should know, No, no this wicked fact of his so slightly shall not goe: The king is iust and mercyfull, he doth both heare and see: See mens desarts, heare their complaynts, to Iudge with equity. My wofull case with speede, I wyll vnto his grace addresse, And from the first, vnto the last, the truth I wyll confesse. So Promos thou, by that same lawe shalt lose thy hated breth, Through breach wherof, thou didst condemne Andrugio vnto death So doing yet, the world will say I broke Dianas lawes, But what of that? no shame is myne, when truth hath showne my cause: I am resolued, the king shall knowe of Promos iniury, Yet ere I goe, my brothers head, I wyll ingraued see. Exit. Scena. 5. Gayler, Andrugio. Gay. Andrugio, as you loue our liues, forthwith post you away.

Assure thy selfe, most faithful friend, I wylbe knowne to none: To none alas, I see my scape yeeldes mee but small releefe, Cassandra, and Polina wyll destroye themselues, with greefe: Through thought yt I am dead: they dead, to liue what helpeth me? Gay. Leaue of these plaints of smal auaile, thank God yt you are free, For God it was, within my mind, that did your safety moue, And that same God, no doubt wyl worke for your and their behoue: An. Most faithful friend, I hope that God, wyl worke as you do say, And therfore, to some place vnknowne, I wyl my selfe conuaye. Gayler, fare wel: for thy good deede, I must remayne thy debter, In meane whyle yet receyue this gyft, tyll fortune sends a better. Gay. God bwy syr, but kepe your mony, your need you do not know. An. I pas not now for fortuns threats, yea though hir force she show And therefore styck not to receyue this smale reward in part. Gay. I wyll not sure, such proffers leaue, tys time you doe depart. An. Since so thou wilt, I wylbe gone adue tyl fortune smile. Exit. Gay. Syr, fare you wel, I wyl not fayle to pray for you the while. Well, I am glad, that I haue sent him gone, For by my fayth, I lyu'd in perlous feare: And yet God wot, to see his bytter mone, When he should dye, would force a man forbeare, From harming him, if pitty might beare sway: But see how God hath wrought for his safety? A dead mans head, that suffered th'other day, Makes him thou'ht dead, through out the citie. Such a iust, good and righteous God is he: Although awhyle he let the wicked raygne, Yet he releeues, the wretch in misery, And in his pryde, he throwes the tyraunt downe. I vse these wordes, vpon this onely thought, That Promos long his rod can not escape: Who hath in thought, a wylfull murder wrought, Who hath in act performd a wicked rape, Gods wyll be done, who well Andrugio speede, Once well I hope, to heare of his good lucke, For God thou knowest my conscience dyd this deede, And no desire of any worldly muck.

Other market maydes pay downe for their meate, But that I haue bought, on my score is set.

Sith fortune thwart, doth crosse my ioyes with care, Sith that my blisse, is chaungde to bale by fate: Sith frowarde chaunce, my dayes in woe doth weare, Sith I alas, must mone without a mate. I wretch haue vowde, to sing both daye and night, O sorrowe slaye, all motions of delight. Come grieslie griefe, torment this harte of mine, Come deepe dispaire, and stoppe my loathed breath: Come wretched woe, my thought of hope to pine: Come cruell care, preferre my sute to death. Death, ende my wo, which sing both daye and night, O sorrowe slaye, all motions of delight. Exit. FINIS. G. W.</field>
