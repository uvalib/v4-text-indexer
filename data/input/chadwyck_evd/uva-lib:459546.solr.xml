      <field name="fulltext">THE BARBERS PLAYE Incipit Quarta Pagina qualiter reversus est a cede quatuor regum. Occurrit rex Salim etc. equitando et Lothe; et dicat Abraham.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Preco dicat: All peace, lordinges that bine presente, and herken mee with good intente, howe Noe awaye from us hee went and all his companye; and Abraham through Godes grace, he is commen into this place, and yee will geeve us rowme and space to tell you thys storye. This playe, forsothe, begynne shall hee in worshippe of the Trynitie that yee may all here and see that shalbe donne todaye. My name is Goobett-on-the-Greene. With you I may no longer beene. Farewell, my lordinges, all bydene for lettynge of [your] playe. Abraham, having restored his brother Loth into his owne place, doth firste of all begine the play and sayth: ABRAHAM Ah, thou high God, graunter of grace, that endinge ne begininge hase, I thanke thee, lorde, that thou hase todaye give mee the victorye. Lothe, my brother, that taken was, I have restored him in this case and brought him home in this place through thy might and masterye. To worshippe thee I will not worne, that iiii kynges of uncouth landes todaye hath sent into my hand, and ryches with greate araye. Therfore of all that I have wone to give the teath I will begynne, the cyttee sonne when I come in, and parte with thee my praye. Melchysedech, that here kinge is and Goddes preyste allsoe iwisse, the teathe I will give him of this, as skyll is that I doe. Godd that hase sende mee the vyctorye of iiii kynges gracyously, with him I praye parte will I, the cyttie when I come to. Here Lothe, torninge him to his brother Abraham, doth saye: LOTH Abraham, brother, I thanke thee that this daye haste delyvered mee of enimyes handes and ther postee, and saved mee from woo. Therfore I will give teathinge of my good whille I am livinge; and nowe alsoe of his sendinge the teath I will give alsoe. Tunc venit Armiger Melchysedech ad ipsum et gratulando dicit Armiger (Here the Messenger doth come to Melchysedech, kinge of Salem, and rejoysinge greatly doth saye): My lorde the kinge, tydinges on right your hart to glade and to lightâ Abraham hath slayne in fight iiii kinges since hee went. Here hee will bee this ylke night, and ryches enough with him dight. I harde him thanke God almight of grace hee had him sente. Here Melchysedech, lookinge up to heaven, doth thanke God for Abrahams victorye, and doth prepare himselfe to goe present Abraham. MELCHYSEDECH, REX SALEM Ah, blessed bee God that is but one. Agaynste Abraham will I gonne worshipfullye and that anonne, myne office to fulfill, and presente him with bread and wyne, for grace of God is him within. Spede for love myne, for this is Godes will. ARMIGER (cum pocula) Here the Messenger, offeringe to Melchysedeck a standinge-cuppe and bread alsoe, dothe saye: Sir, here is wyne, withowten were, and therto bred white and cleare to present him with good chere, that soe us holpenn hasse. Here Melchysedeck answeringe sayth: To God I wott hee is full deare, for of all thinges in his prayer hee hath withowten dangere, and speciallye his grace. Melchysedeck, comminge unto Abraham, doth offer to him a cuppe full of wynne and bred, and sayth unto him: Abraham, welcome moste thou beeâ Godes grace is fullye in thee. Blessed ever muste thou bee that enimyes soe can meeke. Here is bred and wyne for thy degree; I have brought as thou maye see. Receyve this present nowe at mee, and that I thee beeseche. Here Abraham, receyvinge the offeringe of Melchysedeck, dothe saye: Syr kynge, welcome in good faye; thy presente is welcome to my paye. God that hath holpen mee todaye, unworthye though I were, ye shall have parte of my praye that I wan sinse I wente awaye. Therfore to thee that take it maye, the teathe I offer here. Here Abraham offereth to Melchysedeck an horse that is laden. Melchysedeck, receivinge the horse of Abraham verey gladly, doth saye: And your present, syr, take I and honoure hit devoutlye, for much good it may signifye in tyme that is commynge. Therfore horse, harnesse, and petrye, as falles for your dignitye, the teathe of hit takes of mee and receyve here my offeringe. Here Loth doeth offer to Melchysedeck a goodly cuppe, and sayth: LOTH And I will offer with good intente of such goodes as God hath mee lente to Melchysedeck here presente, as Gods will is to bee. Abraham, my brother, offered hasse, and soe will I through Godes grace. This royall cuppe before your face receyve yt nowe at mee. Here Melchysedeck receaveth the cuppe of Loth. MELCHYSEDECK Syr, your offeringe welcome ys; and well I wott, forsoth iwys, that fullye Godes will yt is that is nowe doone today. Goe wee together to my cyttie; and God nowe hartely thanke wee that helps us aye through his postee, for soe wee full well maye. Here they doe goe together, and Abraham dothe take the bred and wyne, and Melc. the laden horse. EXPOSITOR (equitando) Lordinges, what may this signifye I will expound yt appertlyâ the unlearned standinge herebye maye knowe what this may bee. This present, I saye veramente, signifieth the newe testamente that nowe is used with good intente throughout all Christianitye. In the owld lawe, without leasinge, when these too good men were livinge, of beastes were there offeringe and eke there sacramente. But synce Christe dyed one roode-tree, in bred and wyne his death remenber wee; and at his laste supper our mandee was his commandemente. But for this thinge used should bee afterwardes, as nowe done wee, in significationâas leeve you meeâ Melchysedeck did soe. And teathinges-makinge, as you seene here, of Abraham begonnen were. Therfore to God hee was full deare, and soe were both too. By Abraham understand I maye the Father of heaven, in good faye; Melchysedecke, a pryest to his paye to minister that sacramente that Christe ordayned the foresayde daye in bred and wyne to honour him aye. This signifyeth, the sooth to saye, Melchysedeck his presente. Here God appeareth to Abraham and saythe: DEUS Abraham, my servante, I saye to thee thy helpe and thy succour will I bee. For thy good deede myche pleaseth mee, I tell thee witterly. Here Abraham, torninge to God, saythe: ABRAHAM Lord, on thinge that wouldest see, that I praye after with harte full free: grante mee, lorde, through thy postee some fruite of my bodye. I have noe chylde, fowle ne fayre, save my nurrye, to bee my hayre; that makes mee greatly to appeare. One mee, lord, have mercye. DEUS Naye Abraham, frend, leeve thou meeâ thy nurrye thine hayre hee shall not bee; but one sonne I shall send thee, begotten of thy bodye. Abraham, doe as I thee sayeâ looke and tell, yf thou maye, stares standinge one the straye; that unpossible were. Noe more shalt thou, for noe neede, number of thy bodye the seede that thou shalt have withowten dreede; thou arte to mee soe dere. Therfore Abraham, servante free, looke that thou bee trewe to mee; and here a forwarde I make with thee thy seede to multiplye. Soe myche folke forther shalt thou bee, kinges of this seede men shall see; and one chylde of greate degree all mankynde shall forbye. I will hethen-forward alwaye eyche man-chylde one the eyght daye bee circumsysed, as I thee saye, and thou thyselfe full soone. Whoesoe cyrcumsysed not ys forsaken shalbe with mee iwys, for unobedyent that man ys. Looke that this bee done. ABRAHAM Lord, all readye in good faye. Blessed bee thou ever and aye, for therby knowe thou maye thy folke from other men. Cyrcumsysed they shalbe all anon for ought that maye befall. I thanke thee, lorde, thyne one thrall, kneelinge one my kneene. EXPOSITOR Lordinges all, takys intent what betokens this commandement: this was sometyme an sacrament in the ould lawe truely tane. As followeth nowe verament, soe was this in the owld testamente. But when Christe dyed away hit went, and then beganne baptysme. Alsoe God a promise behett us here to Abraham, his servant dere: soe mych seede that in noe manere nombred yt may bee, and one seede mankinde for to bye. That was Christe Jesus wytterlye, for of his kynde was our ladye, and soe alsoe was hee. DEUS Abraham, my servante Abraham! ABRAHAM Loe, lord, alreadye here I am. DEUS Take Isaack, thy sonne by name that thou lovest the best of all, and in sacryfyce offer him to mee upon that hyll there besydes thee. Abraham, I will that yt soe bee for ought that maye befall. ABRAHAM My lord, to thee is myne intent ever to bee obedyent. That sonne that thou to mee haste sent offer I will to thee, and fulfill thy commandement with hartye will, as I am kent. High God, lorde omnipotent, thy biddinge, lorde, done shalbee. My meanye and my chyldren eycheone lenges at home, both all and one, save Isaack, my sonne, with mee shall gonne to an hyll here besyde. Here Abraham, torninge him to his sonne Isaack, sayth: Make thee readye, my dere darlinge, for we must doe a little thinge. This wood doe thou on thy backe bringe; wee may noe lenger byde. A sworde and fyer that I will take, for sacrifyce mee behoves to make. Godes biddinge will I not forsake, but ever obedyent bee. Abraham taketh a sworde and fyer. Here Isaack speakes to his father, taketh the bundell of stickes, and beareth after his father. ISAACK Father, I all readye to doe your byddinge moste meekely, and to beare this wood full beane am I, as ye commande mee. ABRAHAM O Isaack, my darlinge deare, my blessinge nowe I give thee here. Take up this fagott with good chere, and on thy backe yt bringe. And fyer with us I will take. ISAACK Your bydding I wyll not forsake; father, I will never slake to fullfill your byddinge. ABRAHAM Nowe Isaack, sonne, goe wee our waye to yonder monte, yf that wee maye. Here they goe both to the place to doe sacrafice. ISAACK My dere father, I will assaye to follow you full fayne. Abraham, beinge minded to slea his sonne, lifte us his handes to heaven and sayth: ABRAHAM O my harte will breake in three! To here thy wordes I have pittye. As thou wilte, lorde, soe muste yt bee; to thee I will bee beane. Laye downe thy fagott, my owne sonne. ISAACK All readye, father; loe yt here. But why make yee soe heavye chere? Are ye any thinge adread? Father, yf yt bee your will, where is the beaste that wee shall kyll? ABRAHAM Therof, sonne, is none upon the hill that I see here upon this stedde. Isaack, fearinge leste his father will slea him, sayth: ISAACK Father, I am full sore afrayde to see you beare that drawen sworde. I hope for all myddylarde you will not slaye your chylde. Abraham, comfortinge his sonne, sayth: ABRAHAM Dreade thee not, my chylde. I reade our lorde will sende of his goodheade some manner of beast into this fyelde, eyther tame or wylde. ISAACK Father, tell mee or I goe whether I shall harme or noe. ABRAHAM Ah, deare God, that mee ys woe! Thou breakeste my harte in sunder. ISAAC Father, tell mee of this case: why you your sworde drawen hase, and beares yt naked in this place. Therof I have greate wonder. ABRAHAM Isaack, sonne, peace, I praye thee. Thou breakest my harte anon in three. ISAACK I praye you, father, leane nothinge from mee; but tell mee what you thinke. ABRAHAM Ah, Isaack, Isaack, I muste thee kyll. ISAACK Alas, father, ys that your wyll, your owne chylde for to spyll upon thys hilles bryncke? If I have trespassed in any degree, with a yarde you may beate mee. Put up your sworde yf your wyll bee, for I am but a chylde. ABRAHAM O my deare sonne, I am sorye to doe to thee this great anoye. Godes commandement doe must I; his workes are aye full mylde. ISAACK Would God my mother were here with mee! Shee would kneele downe upon her knee, prayeinge you, father, if yt might bee, for to save my liefe. ABRAHAM O comely creature, but I thee kyll I greeve my God, and that full yll. I may not worke agaynste his wyll but ever obedyent bee. O Isaack, sonne, to thee I saye God hase commanded mee todaye sacryfyceâthis is noe nayeâ to make of thy bodye. ISAACK Is yt Godes will I shalbe slayne? ABRAHAM Yea, sonne, yt is not for to leane; to his byddinge I will bee beane, ever to him pleasinge. But that I doe this deolfull deede, my lorde will not quite mee my meede. ISAACK Marye, father, God forbydde but you doe your offeringe. Father, at home your sonnes you shall fynde that you muste love by course of kynde. Be I once out of your mynde, your sorrowe may sonne cease. But yet you must doe Godes byddinge. Father, tell my mother for nothinge. Here Abraham, wringinge his handes, sayth: ABRAHAM For sorrowe I maye my handes wringe; thy mother I cannot please. O Isaak, Isaack, blessed most thow bee! Almoste my wytt I loose for thee. The blood of thy body soe free I am full loth to sheede. ISAACK Father, synce you muste needes doe soe, lett yt passe lightly and over goe. Kneelinge upon my knees too, your blessinge one mee spreade. ABRAHAM My blessinge, deare sonne, give I thee, and thy mothers with harte soe free. The blessinge of the Trinitye, my deare sonne, one thee light. ISAACK Father, I praye you hyde my eyne that I see not the sworde soe keene. Your strooke, father, would I not seene leste I agaynst yt gryll. ABRAHAM My deare sonne Isaack, speake noe moare; thy wordes make my harte full sore. ISAACK O deare father, wherfore, wherfore? Sythenn I muste needes bee dead, of one thinge I would you praye. Sythen I must dye the death todaye, as fewe strokes as yee well maye when yee smyte of my head. ABRAHAM Thy meekenes, chylde, makes mee affraye. My songe maye bee âWele-Awayeâ. ISAACK O deare father, doe away, doe away your makinge of myche mone. Now truely, father, this talkinge doth but make longe taryinge. I praye you come of and make endinge, and lett mee hence bee gone. ABRAHAM Come hyther, my chylde; thow art soe sweete. Thow must be bounden hand and feete. Here Isaack ryseth and cometh to his father, and hee taketh him and byndeth him and layeth him one the alter for to sacrifyce him. ISAACK Father, we muste noe more meete by ought that I cane see. But doe with mee then as thou will; I muste obey, and that is skyll, Godes commandement to fulfill, for needes soe must it bee. Upon the purpose that you have sett you, forsooth, father, I wyll not lett you; but evermore to doe your vowe while that ever yee maye. Father, greete well my brethen yonge, and praye my mother of hir blessinge; I come no more under her winge. Farewell, for ever and aye. But, father, I crye you mercye for all that ever I have trespased to thee; forgiven, father, that hit may bee untill domesdaye. ABRAHAM My deare sonne, lett bee thy mones; my chylde, thow greeves mee every ones. Blessed bee thow, body and bones, and I forgive thee here. Nowe, my deare sonne, here shall thow lye. Unto my worke nowe must I hye. I had as leeve myselfe to dye as thow, my darlinge deare. ISAACK Father, if yee bee to mee kynde, about my head a carchaffe bynde and lett mee lightly out of your mynde, and soone that I were speede. ABRAHAM Farewell, my sweete sonne of grace. Here kisse him and binde the carchaffe about his head, and lett him kneele downe and speake. ISAACK I praye you, father, turne downe my face a little while, while you have space, for I am full sore adreade. ABRAHAM To doe this deede I am sorye. ISAACK Yea, lorde, to thee I call and crye! Of my soule thow have mercye, hartely I thee praye. ABRAHAM Lord, I would fayne worke thy will. This yonge innocent that lieth soe still, full loth were mee him to kyll by any manner of waye. ISAACK My deare father, I thee praye, let mee take my clothes awaye, for sheeding blood on them todaye at my laste endinge. ABRAHAM Harte, yf thow would breake in three, thou shall never mayster mee. I will noe longer lett for thee; my God I may not greeve. ISAACK A, mercye, father, why tarrye yee soe? Smite of my head and lett mee goe. I praye you rydd mee of my woo, for nowe I take my leave. ABRAHAM My sonne, my harte will breake in three to here thee speake such wordes to mee. Jesu, one mee thow have pyttye, that I have moste of mynde. ISAACK Nowe, father, I see that I shall dye. Almighty God in majestie, my soule I offer unto thee. Lorde, to yt bee kynde. Here lett Abraham take and bynde his sonne Isaack upon the aulter, and leett him make a signe as though hee would cutt of his head with the sword. Then lett the Angell come and take the sworde by the end and staye yt, sayinge: ANGELUS Abraham, my servante deare! ABRAHAM Loe, lord, I am all readye here. ANGELUS Laye not thy sworde in noe manere one Isaack, thy deare darlinge; and doe to him none anoye. For thou dreades God, well wott I, that of thy sonne hasse noe mercye to fulfill his byddinge. ANGELUS SECUNDUS And for his byddinge thow doest aye, and sparest neyther for feare nor faye to doe thy sonne to death todaye, Isaack to thee full deare, therfore God hath sent by mee in faye a lambe that is both good and gaye. Loe, have him right here. ABRAHAM Ah, lorde of heaven and kinge of blysse, thy byddinge shall be donne iwys. Sacrifyce here mee sent ys, and all, lorde, through thy grace. An horned wether here I see; amonge these bryers tyed is hee. To thee offered now shall hee bee, anonright in this place. Then lett Abraham take the lambe and kyll him, and lett God saye: DEUS Abraham, by my selfe I sweare: for thou hast bine obedient ayere, and spared not thy sonne to teare to fulfill my byddinge, thou shall bee blessed that pleased mee. Thy seede shall I soe multiplye as starres and sande, soe many highe I of thy bodye comminge. Of enimyes thou shalte have power, and thy blood alsoe in feare. Thow haste beene meeke and bonere to doe [as] I thee bade. And of all natyons, leeve thow mee, blessed evermore shalbee through fruyte that shall come of thee, and saved through thy seede. Here the Docter saythe: EXPOSITOR Lordinges, this significatyon of this deede of devotyonâ and yee will, yee wytt monâ may torne you to myche good. This deede yee seene done here in this place, in example of Jesus done yt was, that for to wynne mankinde grace was sacrifyced one the roode. By Abraham I may understand the Father of heaven that cann fonde with his Sonnes blood to breake that bonde that the dyvell had brought us to. By Isaack understande I maye Jesus that was obedyent aye, his Fathers will to worke alwaye and death for to confounde. Here lett the Docter kneele downe and saye: Such obedyence grante us, O lord, ever to thy moste holye word; that in the same wee may accorde as this Abraham was beyne. And then altogether shall wee that worthye kinge in heaven see, and dwell with him in great glorye for ever and ever. Amen. Here the Messenger maketh an ende: Make rowme, lordings, and give us waye, and lett Balack come in and playe, and Balaham that well can saye, to tell you of prophecye. That lord that dyed one Good Frydaye, the same you all, both night and daye. Farewell, my lordings, I goe my waye; I may noe lenger abyde. Finis</field>
