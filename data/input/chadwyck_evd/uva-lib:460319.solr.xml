      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE. Spoken by The ASS-DEALER. Spectators, if you please, mind what is doing, I hope we all shall be the better for it; Yourselves and I, and this our company, Our masters, and our managersâNow crier Make proclamation, that all people here Give their attentionâSoâcome, now sit down, Take care however, that you're paid for silence. What's my intention, and what brought me here, I'll now explain; that you may know the name Of this our ComedyâFor the fable of it, 'Tis short and plain enoughâAs to its name I'll now inform you, that in Greek 'tis called Onagos: That 'twas written by Demophilusâ Plautus translates it into Latin; and, By your good leave, would call it Asinaria. There's in this piece both pleasantry and wit. 'Twill make you laughâWith favour hear it then, And may god Mars, as he has done before, Go on to take you into his protection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Enter DEMÃNETUS and LIBANUS. LIBANUS. As you would wish your only son should happily, And in good health survive you, I conjure you By your old age, and her you stand in fear of, Your wife, if you've this day play'd false with me, Then may your wife survive you a whole age; And whilst you live together, may she be Your plague, till she has worried you to death. Dem. Since I'm so solemnly conjur'd, I see I must speak out, and answer all your questionsâ I dare not but discover all to you. Be quick then, tell me what you'd wish to know, That I may tell you all I know myselfâ Lib. Answer me seriously to what I ask; Take care too, that you tell me not a lie. Dem. What is it you would ask? Lib. You'd not conduct me To that same place where one stone grinds another. Dem. What is't you mean? Where is it in the world That place is to be found? Lib. Where wicked men Dine on coarse country food, and weep too over it. Dem. What is't you mean? I own I cannot tell, Where should that country be, where wicked men Dine on coarse country food, and weep too over it. Lib. Why, in club island, and in that of rattle-chain; Where your dead oxen gore your living men. Dem. O ho! I take you nowâPerhaps you mean The place where meal is made. Lib. Not I, indeed; I say not so, nor would I have it said so. By Hercules! I would not; and I beg of you That you'd spit out your words. Dem. It shall be done: I will obey you. [coughing and spitting. Lib. Come then, hawk away. Dem. What! more? Lib. Ev'n to the bottom of your entrails. Dem. Still more? Lib. Yes moreâ Dem. How far would'st have me go? Lib. Hawk till you hawk to death; 'tis what I wish. Dem. Take heed you draw not evil on your head. Lib. To your own death? No, no, I meant your wife's. Dem. Good! for that word I'll free you from all fear. Lib. The gods grant all you wish! Dem. Do me one favour: Why should I ask you, what I know already? Why threaten you, for that you've not inform'd me All that you know yourself of this affair? Or why should I be angry with my son, As other fathers us'd to be? Lib. What's this? Dem. I know my son's in love here with a girl, She lives hard by, her name's Philenium. Libanus, is it not so? Lib. In troth you're right; 'Tis even soâBut your son's very ill, Dem. What's his disorder? Lib. He is very ill. Because he has not wherewithal to keep His word. Dem. And are you one then who assists him In his amours? Lib. I am, in troth, and then There is another, our Leonida. Dem. Well done, by Hercules! Why this will gain My favour. Yet you do not know, my Libanus, The humour of my wife. Lib. You feel it first: But we can give a guess. Dem. I own, she's troublesome, And never to be pleas'd. Lib. That long ago I knew; and that or e'er you told me so. Dem. Each father, Libanus, if to me he'd hearken, Would ever let his son have his own wayâ For by this means the son would be affectionate The more, and would become his father's friend. This is the thing I aim at. I desire To be belov'd by mine: I'd act myself Like my own father; who to pleasure me, In a ship-master's dress, by stratagem From a procurer stole a girl I lov'd. Nor at his time of life, advanc'd in years, Was he asham'd impostures to contrive, And purchase with good turns his son's affection. His conduct I'm determin'd now to imitate. This very day did my son, Argyrippus, Ask me to give him a supply of money, Wherewith to forward his amours: in this I'm willing to oblige him: am desirous To forward his amours; that, as a father He may sincerely love meâTho' his mother Holds a tight rein o'er every step he takes, Keeps him with strictness, nor allows him liberty, As fathers, not as mothers use to do. But I do no such thingâespecially Since he has thought me worthy to be made The confidant of his affairs; I ought To shew regard to such a disposition; When, as 'tis right a modest son should do, He makes his application to his father. Yes, I must doubtless find the money for him To carry to his mistress.â Lib. [aside.] I'm amaz'd At this harangue, and fearful how 'twill end. Dem. For on the whole, I know my son's in love. Lib. You wish for that, which to my certain knowledge You wish in vain forâSaurea, the slave Your wife brought with her on her marriage, has More money in her hands than you have, sir. Dem. In fact I've got a portion with my wife, And for that portion giv'n up my authority. In short, I'll tell you now what I would have. My son now stands in need of twenty minÃ¦. You must procure them for him. Lib. And from whom? Dem. Why cheat me of them. Lib. Now you talk quite idly. 'Tis just as if you bad me take some garments From one who is quite nakedâWhat! cheat you? Come onâand without wings fly offâCheat you! You, who yourself have nothing in your power, Unless your wife you've cheated out of somewhat. Dem. Me, or my wife, or Saurea here her slave, Which ever, and whatever way you can, Defraud, impose upon, or robâI promise you, You shan't be hurt, if you this day procure it. Lib. You may as well go bid me fish in air, Hunt with a javelin on the open sea, And there to spread my toilsâ Dem. Well, if you please, Your fellow slave Leonida take with you. Devise, invent, frame some expedient, see My son the money has this day, to give His mistressâ Lib. What are you about, DemÃ¦netus? What if I fall into an ambuscade? If taken by the foe, you will redeem me? Dem. I willâ Lib. Then you may follow other game: Whate'er you pleaseâ Dem. If then no more with me, I'll to the forum. Lib. GoâWhat! and no faster? Dem. Yet one word more. Lib. Your pleasure, sir? Dem. Why this. If I should want you, where shall you be found? Lib. Just where I please, and where my business calls me. Troth, from this time I shall not stand in fear Of any man; nor is there any one Can hurt me, since from what you've just now said, Your mind you have disclos'dâIn this affair If I succeed, I shan't think much of you. I'm going where I thought of; and shall now Employ my thoughts on what I have to do. Dem. Do ye mind? I'm to be found with Archibulus The banker. Lib. What, i'th'forum? Dem. There, if need. Lib. EnoughâI shall remember. [Exit. Dem. 'Tis impossible To find a rogue more cunning or more sly Than this same slave of mineâNor one that's harder To guard againstâAt the same time, if ought You'd have well look'd to, you've nought else to do Than trust him with itâHe had rather die Wretched, than not accomplish what he has promis'd. That he'll procure this money for my son, I know as well, as that I've in my hand This walking-stickâBut why do I delay My going to the forum as intended? I'll go, and there I'll wait him at the banker's. [Exit. SCENE II. Enter ARGYRIPPUS from CLEÃRETA's house. Arg. Is't thus I'm serv'd?âWhat! turn me out of doors! [to CleÃ¦reta within. This my reward for all the good I've done you! To those who have deserved well of you, You do what's ill; to those who have ill deserv'd You do what good you canâBut you'll repent it. I'll now go straitway to the magistrate, And give in all your namesâYou and your daughter I'll charge with capital offences; whores, Destruction, common bane of youth. The sea Is not the sea when 'tis compar'd to you; You're a most dangerous sea indeedâAt sea I found a fortune, here I've squander'd it. I now find out that all my kindnesses And all my presents are of no effect, And have been given to ingrates: henceforth I'll do you all the mischief in my power, Which will be giving you but your deserts. By Pollux! I'll reduce you to the state You first arose from, extreme poverty. By Pollux' temple, I will make you know Who now you are, and what thing once you was, Before I visited your daughter, and Bestow'd my love upon her: on coarse bread You liv'd, and all your cloathing was but rags: And if you'd these, you had to thank the gods for 'em. Now things are better, and you live at ease, You will not own that 'tis to me you owe The obligation: like a savage beast Have you behav'd: but I shall make you tame With hunger. Leave that matter but to me. I am not angry with my dear Philenium. She has merited no ill from me. She did But what you order'd, and obey'd your will: You are her mother and her mistress too. I will revenge myself on you alone, Treat you according to your worth, and give you To th'utmost what you have deserv'd from me. But see, the jade! she does not think me worthy To be approach'd or spoke to, nor will deign To deprecate my anger. But see there Th'enticer's coming out. Before the door Since I am not allow'd to enter in, I'll tell her what I have to say to her. SCENE III. Enter CLEÃRETA. Cle. If any purchaser should offer me For every word you've said, a Philippean, I would not part with themâWhate'er you've said Wrongfully of us, is good gold and silver. Your heart's lock'd up with us, and Cupid keeps The keyâHaste then, begone this instant. Hoist all the sail you can, and ply your oars. The farther you get out to sea, the sooner The increasing surge will bring you back to port. Arg. [aside.] By Pollux! that inspector of the customs Shall not be paid his duty. [to her.] Yes, I'll treat you As you've deserv'd, and as my ruin'd fortune Shall dictate to me: You who have excluded me Your house, when I have not deserv'd from you Such treatment. Cle. Yes, you tell us so in words, But you'll not make it good by deeds. Arg. 'Twas I, 'Twas I alone, who brought you from obscurity, Redeem'd you from your poverty; when I Alone conferr'd my favours on you, you Could scarce return acknowledgement enough. Cle. And still you shall continue so, provided You always give me every thing I ask. Arg. When you are never satisfied, what bounds To giving?âYou have scarce receiv'd a favour, But you are ready to ask something more. Cle. What bounds? Are you e'er satisfied yourself With love, or with enjoyment of my daughter? No sooner have you sent her home to me, But you directly send for her again. Arg. In truth I've given whate'er you wanted of me. Cle. And I have ever sent to you your girl. I've given you a requital, like for like; And what I gave was in return for money. Arg. You use me ill. Cle. Why blame me, if I do My duty? For 'twas never feign'd in story, Painted in pictures, or in poems written, That when a bawd shews favour to a lover, It was for aught but for her own advantage. Arg. 'Twould be but right to give me some indulgence, That I may last the longer. Cle. What! not know, The bawd that is indulgent to a lover, Shews small indulgence to herselfâA lover Is to a bawd just like a fish; which if Not fresh, is good for nothing. When 'tis fresh 'Tis full of juice, 'tis sweet; which ever way, Or in whatever manner 'tis you season it, Or stew'd or roasted; which way e'er you will, You turn it oftenâJust so a new lover, To give is ever ready, ever willing To have something ask'd of himâFor when he takes From a full bag, he knows not what he gives, Nor thinks on what he's out of pocket by it. He thinks on nothing but to make himself Both pleasing to his mistress and to me; The footman, household servants, and the maidens; Nay, a good lover strokes my lap-dog, that Whene'er he sees him, he may wag his tail. I tell you truthâ'Tis right for every one To be attentive to his proper interest. Arg. Yes, to my cost I've learn'd that this is true. Cle. By Castor's temple, if you had to give, You'd tell another tale; but now you've nothing, You think to have your mistress by abusing me. Arg. 'Tis not my way. Cle. Troth, neither is it mine, To let you take away the girl for nothing. But this I'll do in pity to your youth, And from the high regard which I have for you, Considering too, that you have paid attention To our advantage, more than your own fame, If you will give me down upon the nail Two silver talents for your honour's sake, This night you shall possess your mistress gratisâ Arg. But, what if I have not the money? Cle. Why 'Twill be worse for you; she shall go elsewhere. Arg. What is become of that already given you? Cle. 'Tis spentâWas it not so, and I still had it, The girl should be sent to you; and I'd ask For nothingâTrue, I purchase not with money Daylight nor water, sun nor moon, nor night: What else we want, we buy for ready money. If from the baker's we want bread, or wine From out the vaults, if we send ready money We have the goodsâAnd thus it is with us. My hands have always eyesâWithin their palm They never credit ought but what they see. 'Tis an old saying, money down's the thing. Do you attend to me?âI'll say no more. Arg. Now I'm undone, you talk another language: Far different this from that which once you talk'd, When I was wont to make you presents: then You sooth'd me, kindly spake to me, and bless'd meâ Your very house receiv'd me with a smile, Whene'er I came to you. Oft you told me, And told Philenium too the same, you lov'd Me only, and preferr'd me to all others. When I had ought to give, you then were ever Like two young pigeons hanging on my lips: Your likings all depended upon mine: Whate'er I bad you do, or chose to have done, You did: whatever I forbad the doing, Or chose should not be done, with utmost care You'd shun to do, nor dar'd to set about it. Now whether I would have ought done or not, Is no concern of yours, you wicked creaturesâ Cle. Know you not this?âOur trade is very like The trade of fowlingâWhen he has pitch'd upon A place, the fowler throws down corn; the birds Approach it. He who'd seek for gain, must be At some expence. The birds oft eat the corn: But once they're catch'd, they reimburse the fowler. Just so it is with us. Our house, the place; The fowler, I; the corn, the courtezan; The bed is the decoy; the birds, the lovers. They become tame by frequent salutations, By speaking soft and kindly, mutual kisses, With pleasant, sweet discoursing intermix'd. If he should touch her bosom, then it is Advantage to the fowler. Farther, if He has ta'en a kiss, he's caught without a net. You who so oft have made the experiment, Have you forgot this? Arg. There you are to blame To turn away a scholar half instructed. Cle. Come back again, when you have got the money, With confidence; at present, get you gone. Arg. Stay, stay and hear meâWhat am I to give you To have her to myself the whole year round? Cle. To have her to yourself? Why, twenty minÃ¦. On this condition tho', that if another Should bring the money first, farewell to you. Arg. But I, before you go, have something more To say to youâ Cle. Well then, say what you please. Arg. I'm not entirely ruin'd, I've yet left Something to loseâI've wherewithal to give you What you demand; but on my own conditions, That I the whole year have possession of her, And she admit no other man whatever. Cle. The servants shall be all made eunuchs, if 'Tis your desireâBring with you a deed, Containing what is now agreed between us. Enjoin whate'er you please, make your own bargain; Bring but the money with you, all the rest I shall with ease come intoâA bawd's doors, Like those of a collector of the customs, If you bring with you wherewithal, are open: If you have nought to give, why then they're shut. [Exit. Arg. Unless I can procure these twenty minÃ¦ I am undoneâAnd if I pay it not, I'm ruin'd horse and footâI'll hie me now Strait to the forum, try my utmost forceâ I'll beg, I'll earnestly entreat each friend I meet, accost both good and badâAnd if I can't without, must take it up at interest. [Exit. End of the First Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Enter LIBANUS, gaping and yawning, as scarcely awake. LIBANUS. By Hercules! 'tis better for thee, Libanus, To wake and find some lucky stratagem To get this moneyâMany hours have past Since thou did'st quit thy master, and did'st hie Away to th'forum with this view, to feign Some fallacy for the procuring moneyâ There, to this time o'th'day, thou'st slept at easeâ Throw off this indolence and sluggishness, And take to thee again thy wonted cunning. Preserve thy master! and beware of acting Like other slaves, who all their wit employ In cheating and imposing on their masters. But how to get it?âWho shall be my dupe? And whither shall I steer my little boat? 'Tis done; the thing's resolv'd onâBirds on each side Give omens, and approveâThe chough and crow Caw from the left, the raven from the right. They all induce me: Your advice, in troth, I am resolv'd to followâBut what's this? What means the chough by striking with his beak That elm? It is not without causeâBy Hercules! From what I can collect from these same auguries, Or Saurea's back, our usher of the hall, Or mine, will feel the scourgeâBut what means this? What makes Leonida come running hither, Quite out of breath? I fear it bodes but ill To these my schemesâ SCENE II. Enter LEONIDA. Leo. Where shall I now find Libanus, Or our young master, that I strait might make them Merrier than mirth herself? I bring along with me Abundant gain, and triumphâAnd 'tis fit, That, as together we enjoy our pleasures, We should divide the plunder I have got, Between usâ Lib. [aside] Sure the fellow has been pillaging Some house or other, as 'tis usual with him! Woe be to him that kept so ill the door! Leo. I'd be content could I now find out Libanus, With a whole age of slaveryâ Lib. By Hercules! [aside. I'll never be the means to hasten on Your freedom. Leo. Nay, e'en freely yield my back To bear two hundred lashesâ Lib. [aside] Yes, in troth, He offers up his substance: all he's worth Is on his back. Leo. For if he should let slip This opportunity, by Pollux' temple! He'll never overtake it afterwards, Not tho' he drove his car with four white horses. He'd leave his master in the lurch, and thus Give courage to the foeâBut if with me He'll profit by this opportunity, Plenty of good things he and I shall heap Upon his masters, both the son and father: Who, for this kindness, ever will remain Bound to us in the strictest bandsâ Lib. [aside] He's talking Of being bound in bands. I like it not. I fear he has been devising some device For which we both shall feel one common punishment. Leo. I'm ruin'd horse and foot, unless I soon Find LibanusâWhere, in the name of wonder, Where can he be? Lib. [aside] The man is looking out For an accomplice in some bad design. I like it notâ'Tis a portentous sign When a man sweats, and at the same time trembles. Leo. But why, when I'm in haste, are my feet tardy, And my tongue runs so fast?âWhy do I not Bid it be quiet, not wear out the day In chattering? Lib. [aside] Troth the man's unfortunate, To check his patronessâFor should he do Aught that's amiss, she would be perjur'd for him. Leo. Well, I'll make haste, lest I should miss my blow, And come too late to seize upon my prey. Lib. What prey is't that he means?âI will accost him, And wheedle out the businessâI have hollow'd As loud as I can bawl, to give to you The good time of the day. Leo. Ha! Whipping-post, Good day to you. Lib. How is it with you, jail bird? Leo. Townsman of chain-town! Lib. Thou delight of scourges! Leo. When naked, say, how many pounds thou weighest? Lib. In troth I know not. Leo. That I know full wellâ But I, by Pollux, who have weigh'd thee, know, When thou art hung up naked, thy feet downward, Thou weighest an hundred weight. Lib. How know you that? Leo. I'll tell thee how I know, and how it is. When thou'st an hundred weight upon thy feet, When thy hands manacled are tied to a post, Whether thou then art under weight or over, Thou weigh'st a rascal. Lib. Go and hang thyself. Leo. Thy servitude bequeaths thee that by will. Lib. Truce with this gabbleâWhat's the business, say? Leo. And may I trust youâ Lib. Yes, and confidently. Leo. If you've a mind to assist our master's son In his amours, a fair occasion offers. But 'tis attended too with danger: and The hangman will at our expence be famous. Now's the time, Libanus, to shew the world That we have courage and addressâI've thought Of an exploit just now, will render us Most worthy of the torture. Lib. Oh! no wonder My shoulders itch'd but now, as they foretold Some danger tow'rdâWell, what's the business, speak? Leo. Great plunder, but attended with great mischief. Lib. If all the tortures that did e'er exist, Were sworn into conspiracy against me, I have at home a back I think would bear them, Nor need I seek abroad. Leo. Such constancy Of mind if you keep up, then safe's the word. Lib. If 'tis the back's alone to suffer, I Could wish my back were publickâIf the business Is stiffly to deny, to bear the scourge, Nay, to be perjur'd, why depend upon me. Leo. O brave! undauntedly to suffer evil, When opportunity shall offer, this, This is true virtue. He who resolutely Evil endures, shall in the end see good. Lib. Why don't you tell the matter instantly? I long to feel the scourge. Leo. Deliberately Ask me each question, give me time to breathe; Don't you observe I'm out of breath with running? Lib. Well, well, I'll wait your pleasure, even 'till You dieâ Leo. Say where's our master? Lib. Why, our old one Is at the forum, the young one's here within. Leo. I've now enough. Lib. You then are become rich. Leo. No raillery now. Lib. Well, be it soâMy ears Are now in waiting for what you've to say. Leo. Attend, that you may know the whole affair As well as I doâ Lib. Well, I'm silent then. Leo. You make me happy. Do you not remember Our usher of the hall, some time ago, Sold some Arcadian asses to a dealer Of Pella? Lib. I remember it.âWhat then? Leo. That dealer then has sent to Saurea The money for the asses: a young man Came strait, and brought it. Lib. Where is the young man? Leo. Could you but see him, you'd devour him instantly. Lib. Ay, to be sureâBut do you mean those asses, Those old and lame ones, with their hoofs worn out Quite to the quick? Leo. I mean those very asses, That drew a load of elm twigs from the country, And for your use. Lib. I understand you: Yes The same, who from the country once brought you, With your hands tied behind you. Leo. So, I find You've a good memory. In the barber's shop As I was sitting, he began, and ask'd me Whether I knew DemÃ¦netus, the son Of StratoâYes, said I, for I'm His servant; and then shew'd to him our house. Lib. What next? Leo. He said, that he had brought for Saurea The money for the asses, twenty minÃ¦, But that he did not know the man: howe'er DemÃ¦netus he well knewâFinding then He said thus muchâ Lib. What then? Leo. But hearken then, And you shall knowâI instantly put on An easy, and genteely grand behaviourâ And said, I was the usher of the hall. He answer'd me, in troth I know not Saurea, Nor yet what kind of man he is, so then You have no need to be affronted at it: Only bring here DemÃ¦netus, your master, Whom I well know, and I will fetch the money. I told him I would fetch him, and would be At home immediatelyâHe's going now Strait to the baths; and will come here forthwith. What's to be done in this affair now?âSay. Lib. I'm thinking how to intercept the money, Getting between the bearer and our Saurea. The work's rough hewn alreadyâIf the stranger Bring first the money to the house, why then We're both blown upâFor our old man to-day Took me aside; and order'd you and me, On pain of tasting what elm twigs are made of, To find for Argyrippus twenty minÃ¦: This day tooâNay, he order'd us to cheat Our usher of it, or his wife; and further, Promis'd to give us his assistance in it. Now hie thee to the forum to our master; There tell him what we are about to do; That you shall be no more Leonida, But Saurea, till this dealer here has brought The money for the asses. Leo. Well, I'll do As you command me. Lib. I'll amuse him here, Should he come firstâ Leo. But, hark ye! Lib. What's your will? Leo. If while I'm personating Saurea, I Give you a cuff, you must not then be angry. Lib. Take care you touch me not, for if you do, By Hercules! you'll think it an ill omen, That you have chang'd your name. Leo. Yet, in good part I prithee take it. Lib. And, when I return it, Do you the same. Leo. I say no more than what Is ord'narily done. Lib. And I, by Hercules! Tell you but what I'll do. Leo. Refuse me not. Lib. I promise to return you what you bring. Leo. Well, I'll be goneâI know you'll hold yourself In readiness to take what I shall give you. But who is this? 'Tis he, the very man. This instant I'll return. In the mean time Do you detain him here. 'Tis now my pleasure To inform the old man what we have determin'd. Lib. Why don't you do your duty then, and flyâ [Exit Leonida. SCENE III. Enter THE ASS-DEALER, and BOY. Ass-Dealer. By the directions, this must be the house, Where, as they told me, lives DemÃ¦netus. Knock at the door, boy; and if Saurea The usher of the hall is now at home, Call him out hither. Lib. Who is't knocks so hard As if he'd break the door? Enough, I say, If you're not deaf. Ass-D. Why no one yet has touch'd them. Have you your senses? Lib. Why I thought you had, As I had seen you this way coming hither. These doors here are my fellow servants, and I do not like to have them thresh'd; for I Profess myself their friend. Ass-D. There's no great danger, By Pollux! that the hinges should be broken, If in this manner 'tis you answer all Who ask a question. Lib. Why, the door's so made, That if it sees far off a person coming To kick it down, itself ev'n in the instant Calls for the porterâBut why come you hither? Whom are you looking for? Ass-D. Why, for DemÃ¦netus. Lib. Was he at home, I'd tell you so. Ass-D. But Saurea, His usher of the hall, is he at home? Lib. Nor he no more than t'other. Ass-D. But where is he? Lib. He said that he was going to the barber's. Ass-D. Since he went thither is he not return'd? Lib. By Pollux' temple! NoâWhat want you with him? Ass-D. To take these twenty minÃ¦, was he here. Lib. For what? Ass-D. Why for the asses which he sold At market, to a dealer of PellÃ¦a. Lib. I know itâWell, you've brought the money now? He'll soon be here. Ass-D. But say, what sort of man Is Saurea? For I soon shall know if 'tis The man I mean. Lib. Why lanthorn jaw'd, hair reddish, Somewhat gorbellied, with fierce eyes, his stature Nor tall nor short, sour aspect. Ass-D. There's no painter Could draw his picture betterâAnd, by Hercules! I think I see himâWhen he walks, he wags His head. Lib. The man that meets him when he's angry He will be sure to strike. Ass-D. By Hercules! If like Achilles' self he walk'd, as wrathful, Yea, and as full of threats, if he in anger Should strike at me, I would return the favour. SCENE IV. Enter LEONIDA, counterfeiting SAUREA, the usher of the hall. Leo. What's here to do? No one obeys my orders. I just now order'd Libanus to come to me; Told him he'd find me at the barber's shop; But he ne'er came. An ill affair for him! His back and legs will fare the worse for it. Ass-D. A lordly fellow! Lib. Woe be to me now! Leo. Oh! Libanus, I'm to salute a freed-man. What, you've obtain'd your freedom? Lib. Pray forgive me. Leo. By Hercules! e'er long you will repent Your meeting with me here. What was the reason You came not to me at the barber's shop? Lib. This man detain'd me here. [pointing to the Ass-Dealer. Leo. By Hercules! If you had said that e'en great Jupiter Detain'd you, and he was himself to sue for you, You should not 'scape due punishmentâYou rascal! You've disobey'd my ordersâ Lib. [to the Ass-Dealer] Stranger, friend, I am undone. Ass-D. Saurea, I beg of you Misuse him not on my account. Leo. O would I had now in my hand a club!â Ass-D. I beg you be appeas'd. Leo. To make your sides All callous with my blowsâStand off, and suffer me [to the Ass-Dealer, who interposes. To be the death of him, he's always putting me Into a passion. It is not enough To tell the rascal once to do a thing; I must command him o'er and o'er again An hundred times, and ring it in his ears. By Hercules! I've neither breath nor lungs To hollow after himâDid I not order you, Rascal! to take away the dirt which lies Before the doors? to sweep those cobwebs there From off the pillars? Did I not command you To scour those nails upon the door, and make them Shining and bright? And yet all this is nothing: I, as if lame, must never walk without A good oak towel in my handâBecause I've been oblig'd these three days to attend The forum, there to see if any wanted To borrow money upon interest, here At home you're all asleep; and my good master Lives in a hogs-stye, not a houseâTake thatâ [strikes him. Lib. I beg you take my partâ [to the Ass-Dealer. Ass-D. I pray you, Saurea, On my account, forgive him. Leo. Hark you! Sirrah, The carriage of that olive oil, is't paid for? Lib. It is. Leo. To whom? Lib. Stichus, your deputy. Leo. Oh! you're preparing to appease my anger. I know that deputy of mine to be Much the best servant in the houseâThe wines That yesterday I sold to ExÅrambus, The vintner, has he yet paid Stichus for them? Lib. I think so: for I saw the vintner coming Here with his bankerâ Leo. May I ever find Such customers! I've often sold beforehand, And scarce been paid my money in a year. This man is careful, brings the banker with him, And gives an order to repay the money At a fix'd timeâHas Dromo paid his rent? Lib. Not half, I think. Leo. What then of the remainder? Lib. He says, as soon as he has receiv'd some money, He will discharge it; and that he retain'd it Till he had finish'd what he was about. Leo. The cups I lent to Philodamus, say Has he return'd them? Lib. Not yet. Leo. What, not yet? See, what it is to lend things to a friend! You may as well give them at once. Ass-D. By Hercules! [aside. 'Tis over with meâHe's so out of humour He'll drive me off, and not receive the money. Lib. Hark ye! [to Leo.] No more on't. Hear you what he says? Leo. Yes; and I've done. Ass-D. At length, I think he has done. Best to accost him now, ere he begins Ringing againâNow, Saurea, will you give [to Leonida. Attention to me? Leo. O! most certainly. Have you been here some time? By Hercules! I did not see you; pray excuse me, so My passion blinded me. Ass-D. That's not the matter. DemÃ¦netus I want, if he's at home. Leo. Libanus says he's notâBut if you'll pay The money down to me, the obligation I'll promise you again shall be discharg'd. Ass-D. I'd rather pay it when your master's by. Lib. My master knows him, and he knows my master. Ass-D. Well, when your master's present I will pay it. Lib. Pay it him, at my peril I'll engage You shall be safe. For should our old man know You did not care to trust him, he'd be angry: For he himself trusts every thing to him. Leo. Well, 'tis no matter, let him have his way, And keep the money, 'tis the same to meâ Lib. Give it, I say. I'm wretchedly afraid He'll think 'tis I've advis'd him not to trust you. I beg you'd give it him, nor be afraid. The money shall be safe, by Hercules! Ass-D. While in my hands, I verily believe so. I am a stranger here, nor know I Saurea. Lib. Troth, know him now. Ass-D. It may be he, or it May not be heâI know nought of the matter, By Pollux' temple! If 'tis he, why then It must be heâBut this I know for certain I will not pay the money to a man I do not knowâ Leo. The gods confound the fellow! Say not another word to himâHe's so stout: Because he has twenty minÃ¦ in his hands He knows belongs to me. Here's none will take it. Take thyself home: begone from hence, and be No longer troublesome. Ass-D. You grow too angry: It don't become a slave to be so stout. Lib. Dear will you pay for treating him so ill; You will, by Hercules! Dishonest fellow! Thou thing of nothing! Don't you see he's angry? Leo. [aside to Lib.] So, keep it up. Lib. [aloud] Rascal! [softly] I do beseech you Give him the cash, lest he himself abuse you. Ass-D. On your own heads you're only seeking evil. Leo. By Hercules, I'll instant have your legs broke, If highly you do not provoke the scoundrel. Lib. Ruin'd, by Hercules! in my misfortunes Won't you assist a brother, rascal? Leo. Still Persist you in soliciting the scoundrel? Ass-D. How's this? You fellow, who're a slave, to speak In this foul language to a man that's free? Leo. Give him the lash. Ass-D. Ay, that will be your portion, If once I see DemÃ¦netus to-day. I summon you before the judge. Leo. You may; But I'll not go. Ass-D. Not go? Remember this. Leo. I shall. Ass-D. Your back shall answer this, by Pollux! Leo. My back be scourg'd on your account? you rascal! Ass-D. Yes; and I this day shall have satisfaction For your ill wordsâ Leo. What? rascal! How is that? You hang-dog, do you think we want to fly Our master's presence?âGo directly to him, Our master, before whom you just now cited us, And whom you've wish'd to see. Ass-D. Well then, I'll go. But you shall never have from me the money, Unless DemÃ¦netus your master orders me To give it you. Leo. Do as you pleaseâWalk offâ Ill language will you give, and yet not have it Return'd?âI am as good a man as you. Ass-D. No doubt of itâ Leo. This way then follow me. And give me leave to say, no man hath ere Impeach'd my merit; there is not a man In Athens, of more credit than myself. Ass-D. Perhaps so: yet you never shall persuade me To trust my money to a man I know not. Man is to man, to whomsoe'er one knows not, A wolf and not a man. Leo. A second insult! Far, far is this from making satisfaction, For the abuse you have bestow'd upon me; As I had cause to think you would have done. But tho' my dress is mean, I yet am honest, A treasure so inestimable's mine. Ass-D. Perhaps so. Leo. I can tell you more: Periphanes, A Rhodian merchant, rich, entrusted me, During his master's absence with a talent, A silver one; nor was deceiv'd in me. Ass-D. Perhaps so. Leo. You too, if you had but ask'd My character of others, would have had No scruple to have trusted in my hands What you have with you. Ass-D. I deny it not. [Exeunt. End of the Second Act.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. Enter CLEÃRETA and PHILENIUM. CLEÃRETA. And is it, my Philenium, then impossible To make you cease to do what I forbid? And are you so dispos'd to think yourself Free from your mother's jurisdiction? Phil. How, mother, could I think the goddess piety Would hear me, when I pray to her to make me Pleasing to you, if, when I pray, my manners Were such, as your instructions fain would have them? Cle. Is it well manner'd, think you, to oppose My precepts? Phil. How? Cle. Is piety thus worship'd, By lessening due obedience to a mother? Phil. Those who act right I blame not; but I love not Those who are wrongâ Cle. A prating love-sick girl! That's what you areâ Phil. He, mother, is my gain: His tongue demands me, and his person seeks me; His passion pleads, and fair occasion promptsâ Cle. I'm hither come to chide you, and you stand As my accuser. Phil. No, by Pollux' temple! I don't accuse you; nor yet do I think I have a right to do it. I am only Complaining of my lot, when I'm depriv'd Of him I love. Cle. I hope you'll let me have My turn to speak, once in the day at least. Phil. Together with your own, I give you mine Into the bargain; be you then directress When I'm to speak, and when to hold my tongue. But then, by Pollux! if my oar's laid by, And my sole ship remains in dock, remember All's at a stand at home; no pot is boiling. Cle. What's that you say, and with such impudence? How many times have I forbidden you To accost, or to come near to Argyrippus, Son of DemÃ¦netus; to hold discourse With him, or e'en to look him in the face! What has he given us, or what provision Has he e'er order'd to our house? Do you think A smooth persuasive tongue will pass with us For current coin? or that fine subtle speeches Will pass for presents? Of your own accord You love him, you endeavour to get at him, You order him to be call'd to youâThose Who make us presents, you deride: and those Who cheat us, you are desperately in love with. Should any promise, when his mother dies, To make you opulent, ought you to lend Attention to it? Yes, by Castor's temple! While we're in expectation of her death, 'Tis odds but we and our whole family Perish for want of food. If he don't bring Hither to me this day the twenty minÃ¦, (Let him be e'er so bounteous of his tears,) I swear by Castor's temple, out of doors He shall be turn'dâThis day's the very last I'll hear this plea of povertyâ Phil. My mother, If you should bid me eat no food, I'd eat none. Cle. I don't forbid you love those men who give us Aught for the sake of which they should be lov'dâ Phil. But, madam, when one's inclination's fix'd Upon a man, what's to be done? advise me. Cle. Why, look at my grey hairs, my hoary head, And then consult what suits your interest best. Phil. The shepherd, madam, that is set to keep Another's sheep, hath for himself some few Which he can call his own; then nurse his hopes. Let me then love my Argyrippus only For the meer sake of my affection to him. Cle. Go in: in troth I've never seen a girl So saucy. Phil. Madam, I am all obedience. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Enter LEONIDA and LIBANUS. Leo. Great thanks and praise deservedly we pay To perfidy; since we, relying on Our own perfidiousness, deceits and cunning, The hardness of our shoulders, and our setting The elm twigs at defiance, thongs and chains, Prisons and yokes, and fetters too, and collars, Our cruel scourgers, and the fellows that Are well acquainted with our backs, as they Have oft ere this wounded with stripes our shoulders: These legions, all these forces and these armies Manfully fighting, arm'd with perjuries, We have, O brave! subdu'dâThe deed is done By this my comrade's prowess, and my own Courteous demeanorâ Lib. Shew me now the man Can bear the scourge with greater constancyâ Leo. By Pollux' temple, who is't can chant forth Like me thy great exploits, and stratagems In peace and war? Much may be said, in troth, On thy account:âhow those that trusted thee Thou hast deceiv'd;âhow also to thy master Thou hast been unfaithful;âhow thou, on thy conscience, Knowingly, wilfully, hast been perjur'd:âhow Thou hast broke through walls to steal;âand how Thou hast been taken in the very fact. As how thy cause too thou hast often pleaded, Hung by the heels, against eight hardened fellows, Of stripes most sturdy layers on. Lib. I own, That what you say, Leonida, is true. And yet One might recount many exploits of yours, And true ones too:âhow ill you have repaid The confidence in you repos'd; how taken In the very act of theft, and for it, scourg'd In publick;âhow yourself too you forswore;â How you laid hands on sacred things;âand how You've acted to your master's loss, and brought Disgrace and trouble on his head:âhow too You have denied your having e'er receiv'd That which has been committed to your charge: How to your mistress you've more faithful been Than to your friend;âand how you've tired out Six sturdy Lictors, arm'd with pliant elm twigs. And have I ill return'd the compliment? How well the commendation he deserv'd, I've given to my colleague! Leo. One most worthy of me, Most worthy of yourself, and of our geniusâ Lib. No more of thisâAnswer to what I ask. Leo. Say then, what is't you'd have? Lib. Well, have you got The twenty silver minÃ¦? Leo. Sure you conjure. 'Troth, 'twas a smart conceit in old DemÃ¦netus, To make me pass for Saurea; how witty! I scarce could hold from laughter, when he chid The stranger, for not having faith in me When he was absent; and how readily He call'd me Saurea, usher of the hall? Lib. But hold a little. Leo. What's the matter now? Lib. Say, is not this, that's coming out, Philenium? And Argyrippus with her? Leo. Hold your tongue. 'Tis he. Let's listen here to what they say. She is in tears, and holds him by his robe, While he's in tears no lessâWhat can this be? Let's hold our peace and listen. Lib. Be it so. I've got a thought just come into my head, By Hercules! I wish I had a stickâ Leo. For what? Lib. To still these asses in my purse, If they should take it in their heads to bray. [they stand apart. SCENE III. Enter ARGYRIPPUS followed by PHILENIUM. Arg. Why do you hold me back? Phi. Because I love you, And cannot bear you should be absent from me. Arg. Farewell. Phi. I should fare better, would you stay. Arg. I wish you health. Phi. You wish me health, alas! When your departure brings disease upon me. Arg. CleÃ¦reta, your mother, has just given me The last farewell, and bad me to retire. Phi. 'Twill be my death, if I'm depriv'd of you. Lib. [apart to Leo.] By Hercules! the man's turn'd out of doors. Leo. 'Tis plain 'tis so. Arg. I prithee, let me go. Phi. Ah! whither wou'd you go? Why stay not here? Arg. All night, if you desire it, I will stay. Lib. [to Leo.] Do you mark him? he's profuse you find of night work. 'Tis day-time now; and he's too much engag'd. A very Solon, who employs his time In framing laws to make his people good. Meer trifling! Those who to his laws submit, Won't do great things, unless it be to pass Whole days and nights in tippling. Leo. No, by Hercules! He'll never budge a foot if she would let him: Tho' now he seems so much in haste, and threatens To go away. Lib. Peace be with your tongue, that I May hear what 'tis he says. Arg. Again farewell. Phi. Ah! whither are you going now? Arg. Once more Farewell. In t'other world I shall behold you, For I'm determin'd soon as possible To quit this life. Phi. And why now? prithee, say, Why do you, thus unmerited, consign me Over to death? Arg. I,âYou?âI who would die To save your life, if 'twere in any danger; And eke it out with mine. Phi. Why did you threaten To quit this life? Which should you really do, What think you would become of me? For 'tis A thing with me determin'd, that whate'er You do to yourself I from myself shall suffer The very sameâ Arg. O sweeter than sweet honey! Phi. You surely are my lifeâMy dear, embrace me. Arg. With pleasure. [embracing her.] Lock'd thus in each other's arms, O! that we might be carried to the tomb. Leo. [to Lib.] O what a wretch, my Libanus, is a man In love! Lib. A man that's hanging by the heels, In troth, is more so. Leo. Yes, I know it well; And by experience tooâSuppose we go, And one on this, and on that side the other Accost them. Lib. Good day, masterâWhat was't you Had just now in your arms? What, was it smoke? Arg. Why smoke? Lib. Because your eyes now stand in tears: That was the reason why I ask'd. Arg. You've lost The man that would have been a patron to you. Lib. Troth I've lost none, for I ne'er had one yet. Leo. [to Phi.] Good day, Philenium. Phi. May the gods now grant All that you both can wish. Lib. Had I my wish, That wish should be to pass the night with you, And have a cask of wine into the bargain. Arg. Rascal, take heed of what you say. Lib. In troth The wish was for yourself, not me. Arg. Well then Say what you'd have. Lib. I fain would have a slap At him there. Leo. Well, and who will let you do it, You frizzled lecherâWhat! you strike me, you! Whose very food is blows. Arg. You both of you Are far happier than me. For, Libanus, I am determin'd not to live till evening. Lib. And pray, why so? Arg. Because I doat on her, And she on me: and yet I've nought to give her, Nought in the world: on which account, her mother Has turn'd me out of doors. The twenty minÃ¦ Which young Diabolus is this day to give her, To have possession of her the year round, Have been the death of me. See, of what force Are twenty minÃ¦, and what feats they'll do. The man who loses them is happy, I, Who have not them to lose, am quite undone. Lib. Has he paid down the money? Arg. No, he has not. Lib. Pluck up your courage then, nor be afraid Of ought. Leo. Hark! Libanus, aside this way A little. Somewhat I've to say to you. Lib. Your pleasure? Arg. Yes, 'tis pleasant talking, when At the same time you can embrace each other. Lib. You'll please to know, all things are not alike Pleasant to all. Caresses, while you're talking, To you and such like lovers, are full pleasant. But these embraces I regard not. Leo. So Philenium there despises mine. Yourselves Then do, what you're persuading us to do. Arg. Yes, and with all my heart, by Pollux' temple! You, if you please, mean time may step asideâ Leo. [to Lib.] Suppose we have some sport now with our master. Lib. Troth, he deserves it richly. Leo. Then suppose I make Philenium, while he's by, embrace me. Lib. I wish you may so, trothâ Leo. Come this way then. Arg. Well, what am I to hope for? Ha'nt you yet Not all this while had conference enough? Leo. Attend then both: and with a greedy ear Devour up my discourseâFirst of all then That we're your slaves, we don't deny: But if Twenty good silver minÃ¦ are brought to you, How will you call us then? Arg. I'll call you free. Leo. And not your patrons too? Arg. Yes, even that. Leo. Look, here are twenty minÃ¦ in this purse. These, if you'd have it so, I'll give to you. Arg. Protector of your master, may the gods Preserve you! you're an honour to the people, Treasure of treasures, of my life preserver, Of love commander: here, put, place it here, Tye the bag round my neck. Leo. I know not how, As you're my master, so to burden you. Arg. But, rid you of the trouble; give it me To carry. Leo. No, I'll bear it like a porter; You go before me, and without a burden. 'Tis a civility to a master due. Arg. How now? What are you doing? Why do you not Give me the bag, unwieldy as it is? Leo. Tell her, to whom you'd give it, that of me She may demand it; where you'd have me place it, It may slip downâ Phi. My pigsney, my sweet rose, My soul, my joy! O give it me, Leonida, Nor part such lovers. Leo. Call me then, Philenium, Your little sparrow, chicken, and your quail; Your lambkin, pretty little kid, your calveling. And take me by the ears, and press your lips To mine. Arg. Kiss you, you rascal? Leo. What is't seems Unmeet in that? I say you shall not have it, Till she embrace my kneesâ Arg. What want compels me to! Your knees shall be embrac'dâNow give it me. Phi. Come, my Leonida, give your master lifeâ Redeem yourself by this your kindness to him, And with this money buy your liberty. Leo. You are too kind, too amiable; and if 'Twere mine, you should not press me so to give it. 'Tis better you address yourself to him; He gave it me to keep for him. Then go, Approach him sweetly, sweetâ[to Lib.] Here! Libanus, Take thisâ[giving him the bag.] Arg. What! playing on me still, you rascal! Leo. By Hercules! I'd done it, if you had not Embrac'd my knees so hardâCome on, [to Lib.] 'tis your turn now To play on himâCome onâEmbrace that fair one. Lib. Peace, hold your tongue, let me alone. Arg. My dear, Let us approach him; a good lad, in troth! Not like this thief here. Lib. Come, let's walk a little. Now will they both petition me. Arg. By Hercules! If you would save your master's life, my Libanus, Give me those twenty minÃ¦; you behold me A man in love, in want into the bargain. Lib. We'll see; 'tis possible it may be done. Come here again at night. In the mean time Command Philenium to intreat me for it. Phi. And how intreat for't? With a little love, Or with a kiss? Lib. Upon my word, with both. Phi. Well, I conjure you, take good care of bothâ Arg. Give me the bag, my patron, my good Libanusâ It better suits a freed-man, than a patron, To bear a burden with him in the way. Phi. My little golden pigsney, my dear Libanus, I'll love you, I'll do what you will, but give us That money. Lib. Call me then your duckling, pigeon, Your little kitten, swallow, your jackdaw, Your pretty sparrow, or your manikin. Make me a serpent strait, that I may have A double tongue. Now, in your arms encircle me, Embrace my neck. Arg. What! how! embrace you, hang-dog! Lib. What, then you think that I'm unworthy of it? Such an unworthy thing you shall not say Of me, and go unpunish'd for itâBy Pollux! You shall, this day, carry me on your shoulders; Or never hope to carry off this money. Arg. I carry you upon my shoulders? Lib. Yesâ For on no other terms you'll have the money. Arg. By Hercules! 'tis over with meâYet If true decorum can admit a master To bear his slave upon his shoulders, mount. Lib. 'Tis in this manner that we tame the proud. Stand stillâSoâRarely well, my masterâSo, Now move: well done! I never knew a horse More wiseâ Arg. Come, mount directly. Lib. There, 'tis done. [mounting on Argyrippus's back.] Hey! What's the matter? How you move indeed! I'll sconce you of your feed of corn, unless You amble betterâ Arg. Prithee, Libanus, No more; enoughâ Lib. You'll by entreaty get Nothing of me to-dayâNow must I spur My beast against the hillâThen will I send him Strait to the miller's, there to tire him out With runningâStop then, that I may get down; 'Tis more tho' than you merit, for you're naught. [coming off from his shoulders. Arg. What now is to be done? since at your pleasure You both of you have play'd upon us both, Will you now give the money to me? Lib. Yes; If you will here erect to me a statue, An altar too, and offer on't an ox In sacrifice as to a god: for I To you am as your god Salvation. Leo. Why don't you, sir, get from that fellow there, And then apply yourself to me; and grant me What he has been asking you, prayers and a statue? Arg. By what name will your godship then be call'd? Leo. Why, favourable Fortune. Arg. Troth, in that You beat him out and out. Lib. Why, can a man Have any thing that's better than the god Of health? Arg. Tho' I speak in favour of The goddess Fortune, yet I censure not The god of health. Phi. In troth, by Castor's temple, They both of them are good. Arg. That I shall know, When they give ought that's good. Leo. Then only wish The thing that you would have, should happen to you. Arg. What if I do? Leo. Why, you shall have your wish. Arg. I wish to have that fair one's company All the year round. Leo. 'Tis done, you have obtain'd it. Arg. Indeed! Do you say so? Leo. Certainly, I say it. Lib. Come now in turn to me, and try my skill. Wish what you will, and it shall come to pass. Arg. What can I wish for, more than what I want? Twenty good silver minÃ¦ in a bag To give her mother. Lib. Why the thing is done. Take courage, you've obtain'd your wish. Arg. 'Tis common For Fortune, aye, and for Salvation too To disappoint. Leo. I was the head to-day Which got this money for you. Lib. I the foot. Arg. I see nor head nor foot of all your talking. Nor can I find the drift of what you say, Nor why you play thus on me. Lib. Come, enough We've tantaliz'd himâLet us tell him now The affair just as it is. Mind, Argyrippus! It was your father's order we should bring This money to you. Arg. And you both are come Most a-propos. Lib. Then, here are in this bag Twenty good minÃ¦, got by no good means. He order'd us to give them to you; but, Upon conditions. Arg. Prithee, what conditions? Lib. That you would entertain him with a supper, And let him pass a night with this your mistress. Arg. Tell him to come, I beg you. 'Tis but fit We should do what he'd have us, since he has Thus brought again our scatter'd loves together. Leo. And will you, Argyrippus, then permit Your father to embrace your mistress? Arg. Yes, Her love will let me do it. Haste, Leonida, I beg you, hasten, and conjure my father That he come hither. Lib. He has long ago Been here within. Arg. He did not come this way. Lib. He went in private round the garden, thro' The little court, that none of his domesticks Might see him coming hither: He's afraid His wife should come to know itâShould your mother Know how this money was obtain'dâ Arg. Keep off! Words of bad omenâQuickly inâFarewellâ Leo. And for you two, go on and love each other. [Exeunt. End of the Third Act.</field>

'Twill not, I hope, displease you, son, if she Rests on the couch with meâ Arg. My duty, sir, Forbids my doing ought may grieve your sight. And tho' I love Philenium desperately, Yet I'll restrain myself; nor be uneasy To have her place herself by youâ Dem. My son, It well becomes a young man to be modest. Arg. That, the respect I owe to you, would teach me. Dem. This entertainment let us season, then, With wine, and joyous conversationâI Would not that you should stand in awe of me, My son: No, no, I'd rather you should love me. Arg. Sir, I'll do both: that's what becomes a son. Dem. I should believe you, did I see you chearful. Arg. And do you think me melancholy, sir? Dem. What! when I see you look as sorrowful, As if the judge was passing sentence on you. Arg. Ah! say not so. Dem. I won't, if you'll not look so. Arg. Well! now look on me: now you see I'm laughing.

My son too privy to it; and knows his father Is perpetrating now this wicked action. Par. Look on me as the greatest villain living, If you shall ever find in this affair I've told you ought but truth. Art. Unhappy woman! I who had always thought I had a husband Excell'd in temperance, chastity, sobriety, And fond too of his wifeâ Par. But from this time Esteem him as a worthless wretch, a drunkard, Incontinent, a hater of his wife. Art. In troth, if what you say was not the truth, He would not do as now he does. Par. By Hercules! 'Till now, I ever look'd upon him, as A sober man: but here, this present action Demonstrates what he is: at a debauch With his own son! and keeping of a wench, An old decrepid fellow! Art. 'Twas for this, By Castor's temple! that he sup'd abroad Each day, to me pretending that he went To Archidemus, ChÃ¦rea, or Cherestratus, Chratinus, Chremes, Dinias, or Demosthenesâ He studies nothing but debauchery, And spends his time in brothels with his wenches. Par. Why don't you bid your maidens drag him in Headlong, and truss him up immediately? Art. Let me alone, I'll treat him as he merits. Par. I doubt not that, as long as he's oblig'd To treat you as his wife. Art. I thought, for my part He was on business at the senate, or Among his clients; with these things so tir'dâ He snor'd all nightâand from his work all day Came home as weary as a dogâHe ploughs Another's land, and leaves his own untill'd; And not content to be debauch'd himself, Debauches his own son into the bargain. Par. Follow me this way only, I'll take care That you shall catch him in the fact. Art. By Castor! I wish for nothing more. Par. Stay then a little. Art. Well, what is't I'm to do? Par. Suppose, you see Your husband on a couch, upon his head A wreath, and in the embraces of his mistress: Say, should you know him? Art. Yes, most certainly. Par. See, there's your man.

Son, I own it. Arg. What do you own? Dem. Why, that I die with love. Par. [apart.] Hear you what 'tis he says? Art. Yes, yes, I hear it. Dem. Shall I not, tell me, when I once get home Filch from my wife the robe she's fondest of, And bring it to you? Yes, in troth, I'd do it. Tho', if I did it not, I could be sure My wife would die before the year was out. Par. Do you imagine this is the first time He has been in a brothel? Art. Yes, I find, By Castor's temple, he's been filching from me, When I have had suspicions of my maidens; And punish'd them when they were innocent. Arg. Order some wine, sir; for it seems an age Since last I drank. Dem. Boy, fill a cup of wine On this side here; and on the other, love, Give me a kiss. Art. Wretch that I am! undone! See how the hang-dog kisses! an old goat With one foot in the grave! Dem. How sweet's thy breath, When I compare it with my wife's. Phil. Say, love, Does your wife's breath smell strong? Dem. I'd rather drink Stinking ditch water, was it necessary, Than kiss herâ Art. O the wretch! Par. By Castor! yes, He well deserves to be one. Arg. What do you say, My father? Art. Ay, let's hear what 'tis you say? You will pay dear for what you've said of me. Come but once home, I'll teach you what it is To speak thus of a wife, who brought with her A portion. Arg. [to Dem.] What, don't you then love my mother? Dem. Who I? Why yes, I love her well enough Now she's not here. Arg. And what and if she was? Dem. I'd rather she was dead. Par. Yes, this man loves you, And has a curious way to tell you so. Art. By Castor's temple, he shall profit by it. For if he once come home to-day, I'll take My full revenge in kissing him. Arg. Come, father, Throw the dice first, and then I'll take my turn. Dem. Well thenâ'Tis you that I invoke, Philenium, And my wife's deathâ[throwing the dice.] Ha! this is Venus' cast. Boys clap your hands, and fill me out a bumper In honour of my cast. Art. I can hold out No longer. Par. 'Tis not to be wonder'd at, Since you've not learn'd the business of a fuller. 'Tis time to shew yourself. Art. Yes, I will live, By Pollux! and this very day you'll find You've made that invocation to your loss. [Here Artemona and the Parasite discover themselves. Par. Haste, some one run, and call the sexton hither. Arg. Health to you, madam. Art. I am well in health. Par. DemÃ¦netus is now no more. 'Tis time That I withdraw. The fight grows hot apace. I'll to Diabolus, and strait inform him I have obey'd his ordersâAnd persuade him While these are squabbling, that we get our supper. To-morrow I'll conduct him to the bawd, That he may give to her the twenty minÃ¦; And that he may be happy with his mistress. I then shall hope to induce this Argyrippus To agree to pass alternate nights with her. Which, if I don't obtain, I lose my patron, He loves this girl so desperately. [Exit. Art. Why Do you here thus entertain my husband? Phil. Troth, He teiz'd me to it with his importunity. Art. Come, sir gallant, arise! go, get you home. Dem. 'Tis over with me. Art. Yes, that's sure enough, Deny it not: thou worst of men, by Pollux! The cuckow's still upon his nest. Sir gallant! Rise up; go get you home! Dem. Wretch that I am! Art. You say but what is trueâArise, sir gallant, Go, get you home. Dem. A little this way, prithee! Art. Come, sir gallant, rise up! Go, get you home. Dem. Wife, I conjure you. Art. Now, I am your wife. But lately, when you heap'd abuses on me, I was your hatred, your aversion, not Your wife. Dem. I'm utterly undoneâ Art. Well then, Does your wife's breath smell strong? Dem.
