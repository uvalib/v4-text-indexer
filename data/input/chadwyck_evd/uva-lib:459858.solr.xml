      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS PRIMUS. [Scene I. The King's Camp near Mora.] A hott Alarum. Enter hastily att severall Doores Monasin, Filadin, Cratoner, with their swords drawne. Fil. All's lost! The very Guards the danger shun, As fast as to itt Honour bids them run. Feare has soe blinded them, they doe not see Their ruine or, what's worse, their Infamie. Crat. If all bee lost, then lett us rob the foe Of the full glory of their overthrow By killing of our selves. Mon. They then will say Despaire, nott Honour, taught us that bold way. Lett's therefore shew that all the Rebells powers, Had they bin fac't by a few swords like our's, Had found their Triumph would soe dearly cost That itt had rather caus'd their greif than boast. Enter Thrasolin. Thras. What meanes this rage, that sitts on every brow, And why in such a threatning posture now? Mon. Can Thrasolin aske that, yett know and heare Soe many dangers certaine are and neare, That now wee doe nott on our Reasons call Which to avoide, but noblest where to fall? Fil. 'Tis but the Sinne of Fortune if wee dye, But, Thrasolin, 'tis our Sinne if wee fly. Thras. If this the bussinesse is, then on my word Each of you may with safety sheath his sword; For you will find, when these dissorders end, They came not from a foe, but from a freind. Mon. Who then cou'd in our campe such things performe, Or rather say what furie raisd this storme, A storme soe black and horrid I may well Say, 'tis not like, but 'tis it selfe a Hell? Thras. Your absence kept till now my plott untold. Therefore its rise and Progresse I'll unfold. It is not sure to any here unknowne Melizer shou'd by right possesse the throne. Nor is't lesse true, that man who rules us now Is both a Tirant and usurper too, For when Evender withe fight did fall, The Monster was the Armies Generall, And when the Royall Melizer hee shou'd Have Crown'd as being first Prince of the bloud, Hee seiz'd on him, and by his boundlesse pow'r Made him close prisoner in the fatall Tower, Where still our lawfull king hee has deteyn'd; But, finding how men murmur'd that hee reign'd, The better to excuse all that was past, Declar'd his only sonne, young Altimast, Shou'd marry our faire princesse Rosocleere, Who is to our true king th'undoubted heire. But, when th'appointed wedding day drew neere, Wee noe more news of Altimast cou'd here. Fil. After which sin, hee in a worse did fall, Forcing away our noble Generall. Mon. And some do say the Tyrant's cause of Hate Was on the score of Love as much as state; For, though hee be on his declineing age, Yet Altemera did his heart Engage, Whose Charming beautie, as 'tis knowne by all, Has been ador'd long by our Generall. Crat. Who can such needlesse talke as this Endure? Wee knowe our ills, but long to know the Cure. Thras. Know then that I, beleiving nothing might To our wrong'd King sooner restore his right Than calling Clorimun, our Generall, back, 'Twas I this night did this disorder make. I let the souldiers knowe that hee must die, Unlesse they sav'd him by a mutiny, Which fiction for a truth amongst them went. With teares his danger they did first lament; Then, from small numbers grew a mighty croud, And then, from Whispering grew to talking loud; Marching directly to the Tyrants tent, Demanded Clorimun from bannishment. Fil. Then all those troubles did this night befall Is but to bring us back our Generall? Crat. I to their party am already gott. The End is Noble though the way bee nott. Thras. Yett 'twas the fittest way wc h I could choose; For wc h successe must bee my best Excuse. Besides, in this great businesse I was loath That ought butt Tumult should have given itt growth. All formall plotts I therfore did decline, And made that looke like chance wc h was Designe. Mon. The Tyrant this affront will never brooke: Butt tell us, Thrasolin, how does hee looke? Thras. Perplex't as is the Campe, his Reason heere Serves nott to silence, butt augment his feare. Sometimes hee thinkes, the Rebells being nigh, That wee and they are in Confederacy. Then straight hee thinkes, from honour or from spight, Wee scorne our selves, butt by our selves to right. A Great Cry within, And âClorimun for our Generallâ often repeated. Enter Kinge and Gesippus. Thras. Butt who are those wc h yonder now appeare? Soft! 'Tis the Tyrant fill'd with rage and feare. King. Oh Gentlemen, lett itt bee never knowne, You spend the time in Consultation, When such is the insulting souldiers rage, 'Tis blood, nott words, their fury must asswage. Thras. If blood their fatall fury had nott fed, It had bin, sir, as soone as kindled, dead; For each of us has spilt with his owne hand What well might satisfie for all the Land, Though every part of itt had bin as bad As this tumultuous night the Campe has made; Which to their rage has added such a growth, They say that wee are judge and partie both. Fil. And, sir, they now are ready to pursue Their mutiny, with yor dire Murther too. Mon. Which, if perform'd, Rebellion in short time Will prove as much their interest as crime. Ges. These Gentlemen, to whome you lend your eare, Speake the Results of Reason, nott of feare. The Fitt in my opinion is too high Now to prescribe a daring Remedy. The Cry continued. Thras. You cannott, Sr, a Middle Councell choose. The Army now will take if you refuse, And if their strength they once but understand, 'Twill teach them from obeying to Command. In your resolving be not, sr, soe sloe, For the more forc'd th'action then will show. To yeild at last, and yet at first to strive, Show's them 'tis they that take, not you that give. You may retire to Leptis which is nigh, And is a place of strength and Loyaltie. When you are once out of the Souldiers powers, They must in consequence be soone in yours. King. This Councell, which on mee you all bestowe, I must confesse is wise, but then 'tis low; And hee a Crowne does not deserve to weare, Who, whilst hee has it on, admitts of feare. Ges. This Resolution, which soe much you prize, As, sr, it is not low, soe 'tis not wise. Permitt mee, sr, to say your Courage here, As the case stands, will like dispaire appeare. Fil. Besides, what they for Clorimun pretend, May bee their maske, and a worse thinge their End. The Rebells forces are a mighty power, And hourely looke for their brave Lucidor. Memnor and Clatus and more men of name Are now amongst them, waiting butt for fame. Ges. When e're you please, sr, Doubtlesse you may doe What yor resentments now would drive you too. And yor retirement may bee made appeare To springe from yor Contempt, nott from yor feare. What greater ill can on yor Army fall Than to want you to bee their Generall? King. Well, for this time, what you advise, I'le doe. Goe, Thrasolin, and lett the Army know I grant them their Request, for now they shall Possesse agen their long'd for Generall. But stay: for what if Clorimun should, now That fortune smiles, show her an angry brow? Thras. If nor his King, nor Country, cou'd invite His Conquering Sword now to defend their right, Yett Altemera's love soe fills his brest, 'Twill force him from his solitude and rest, And make him Court againe the Worlds applause By acting thinges transcendent as their Cause. King. You then, to whom his heart soe well is knowne, Shall carry to him his Commission: Tell him from mee, wou'd hee cast off his pride And guide himself, as hee can Armies guide; Or could hee but attaine att length to this, To show his passion butt his subject is, There's none who beares that name shou'd have in mee Soe just and high an interest as hee. Gesippus, come! to Leptis wee'le retire, There waite th'effects of granting your Desire. Thras. Permitt us as yor Guards to waite on you, For none can tell what men enrag'd may doe. King. I more than they shou'd then bee in the blame. My guards shall bee my courage and my fame, For if they saw with other Guards I went, 'Twould make that looke like feare, which is Contempt. Yett, Gentlemen, yor care therin I see, Which, e're longe, I'le nott faile to gratifie. [Exeunt King and Gesippus. Thras. Well, my good friends, what thinke you of my lye, And of my plott, and of my mutinie? Fil. That all are virtuous, I most freely grant, For nought is virtue wc h successe does want. Crat. Well, 'tis an even lay that most of those Whom to this mutinie thou did'st dispose, Will suffer death or else some torturing paine, And thou, for itt, will high rewards obtaine. Mon. An Even lay! I thought thee wiser growne! The wager is att lowest, two to one. For those two powers who governe all mankinde, Fortune and Justice, both of them are blinde. Fil. Our fooling for a while lett's throw away. This is a time of earnest, nott of play. Thras. My grave and prudent lookes I'le now Command, For souldiers see better than understand; I'de rather farre, when I the businesse breake, Butt wisely looke than only wisely speake. [Exeunt. [Scene II. A Chamber in Altemera's Palace at Mora.] Enter Lucidor and a page. Luc. Goe, tell Candaces that I begge I may My parting Sighthes to Altemera pay. Then lett all thinges bee soe prepar'd to night, That I may leave the Towne by dawne of Light. [Exit Page. [Walkes in great distemper. How can that heart wc h does her image beare Admitt of ought soe nigh to sin as feare? If butt the thought of absence bee such paine, How can I then th'enduring itt sustaine? Death I have seene a thousand times and more, Butt never knew what trembling was before; Which proves my parting is an ill more high Than, ere shee lov'd, I thought itt was to die. Enter Altemera and Candaces. Can you forgive mee, Madam, that I thus Present you sorrows soe infectious? Alt. I can forgive you all thinges, I declare, Butt leaving mee, and leaving mee for warre, For which soe little Argument I finde, My reason makes that sin the more unkinde. Luc. You see my greifs such deepe impressions give, 'Tis better under them to die than live. Else you cou'd never soe unkinde have bin As thus to call my punishment, my sin, Nor to those sorrowes under which I groane, Could you have thought itt fitt to adde yor owne. Alt. 'Tis only you have yor owne troubles wrought, For they, alas! are not impos'd, butt sought. If you desire to shun them, what I say Might move you now to cast them all away. Did you butt creditt what you still professe,â That I alone can make yor happinesse,â You wou'd nott yor obedience thus decline, Butt end by paying itt, yor greifs and mine. Luc. Ah, Madam, with what face cou'd I possesse The most exalted of all happinesse, And nott in every way of honour strive To show that I would meritt what you give? Butt were my Laurells as my myrtells are, Had I all glories found in peace or warre, All were as short of meritt, I would vow, As by yor Love I am above itt now. Yet, I confesse, I cannott butt designe To show my failings are fates sins, nott mine. Alt. This proves the truth of what I said before: Though you love mee, yett you love glory more; Butt Lucidor, your's is nott neere to me Of soe great value, as yor Company; And, sure, if mine were butt to you as deare, You wou'd nott, to Court glory, leave mee heere. Luc. Leave you for glory! witnesse, yee blest powers! My only glory is that I am your's. And from this warre I hope for this reward,â Against the Tyrants Lust, to bee yor Guard. You are soe good, hee ill in such excesse, 'Twere sin to doubt my safety or successe. Alt. Yett when I thinke how many dangers are Waiting for forward courages in warre, Sorrow invades mee soe, I must confesse, My reason makes them rather more than lesse. Luc. Hee, Madam, that is destin'd unto you, Must needes bee destin'd unto Triumphes too. The Justice of the Gods is sure too high Yor care to give mee, and their owne deny. I have yor Love, and in yor Quarrell fight: That makes itt duty, this makes itt delight. In yor just Cause all dangers I despise. My Sword shall bee resistlesse as yor Eyes. Alt. Since you will hold yor Resolution, This Comfort yett will stay when you are gone, For by itt this great Truth will clearer shine,â Yor want of kindenesse cannot lessen mine. Yett how you love my life, lett itt be showne In being carefull to preserve yor owne. My eyes, I hope, are kinder than my words, For greife to these a passage scarce affords: And yett I should not mourne my sorrow growes; Words cannott speake soe much as silence does. Luc. What is't can bringe poor Lucidor releif, When even yor kindnesse, Madam, makes his greif? [Exeunt. [Scene III. The Rebels' Camp near Mora.] Enter Memnor and Clatus. Mem. The cause of yor dispute you may decline, 'Tis enough hee's yor foe to make him mine; But will hee sure bee heere to morrow night? Clat. As sure as that next day I'le with him fight. Butt I'le relate our Quarrell in one word, That you may see 'tis worthy of yor sword. After some strife 'twixt Lucidor and I, Whose Coulers in the Feild should formost flyeâ Mem. Hold, Clatus, pray! for if yor Quarrell bee Well grounded, you're the lesse oblig'd to mee; And if an unjust Quarrell you pursue, Then I am much the less oblig'd to you. The story cannott more my friendshippe binde, And you by telling itt may change my minde. Clat. How I mistooke! in mee some feares itt bred, Since Lucidor yor sister is to wedd, You wou'd nott butt with difficulty bee Engag'd to serve as second now to mee. Mem. If, my good friend, yor Quarrell should bee found Built, as yor feares, on a mistaken ground, Lett's mend it by good fighting, which has ty'd, Often ere now, successe to the wrong side. But that I may be better understood, Knowe freindshipp is a greater tye than blood. A sister is a name must not contend With the more high and sacred name of freind. That but to mee my mothers word makes knowne, But I, for this, need but to take my owne. Come! name the time and place. I long to try, By vallour's doome, whose Collours first shall fly. Clat. The place shall be betwixt the Grove and Cell Where the late pious Anchorite did dwell. The time, my Memnor, I desire might bee As soone as wee can our swords length but see. Mem. Spoke like one fitt to fight with Lucidor, For honour should be won at every houre, And hee must sure deserve her favours best Who does solicite them the earliest. Bee sure that too much sleepe thou dost not take. Clat. That Complement shall make mee earlier wake. [Exeunt. [Scene IV. A Hermit's Cell near the King's Camp.] Enter Clorimun and Thrasolin. Clor. Move mee no more, I say. The world to mee Is now, what still to wise men it should bee; And to relapses nothing can mee winn. I hate it now, as virtuous men hate sinne. Thras. Come! to this Cell a noble farewell give, Where mallancholly buries you alive. Then Cloath your selfe with Armour, and you'l see Your old and great attendant, Victory, Did never yet soe much to fortune owe, As in this Warre inconstancy to showe. Clor. The Victory! I'le tell thee, Thrasolin, I'de rather conquest on my Passions winn, Than from my Cell one houre my selfe dispose To winn a Conquest over all my foes. Thras. Alasse! deare Generall, from whence proceeds This strange aversion to heroick deeds? Have you for soe long time on Glory fedd, That you on it at length have surfeited? Or doe you think it is its utmost rise Thus to have power all Glory to despise? If none of these, then your assistance bring, And save your sinking country and your King. Clor. Hee's an usurper whome for King you owne. Thras. I call him King, because hee fills the Throne. Clor. Hee's an ungratefull man, and you well knowe 'Tis not his Love, but feare, which courts mee now. When I at Leptis his sunck hopes did raise, And such things did, he vow'd excell'd his praise, And by those actings that peace to him brought With fame, wc h else hee wou'd with gold have bought, Yet heeâ Thras. Noe more! Denying you your due, Hee wrong'd him selfe more than hee iniur'd you. But if for him you will not undertake This Warre, yet doe it for your Countries sake, Your sinking country which on you does call, Who wee are certaine can prevent our fall. Clor. Thou talk'st as if I govern'd destiny, When that does governe Monarchyes as mee. Those stormes it sends but as a frightning ill, May be o'recome by Courage and by skill, But if to act our ruine fate thinks fitt, Wee then forsake the helme, and must submitt. Kingdomes, like private lives, have periods sett, And when Heaven calls, who can deny the debt? Thras. Grant this, and that our fatall time were come, Wou'd Clorimun outlive his Countries doome? Clor. Why not? Because I cannot still enjoy That which I love, must I my selfe destroy? Thras. Yet if death Altemera shou'd destroy, You wou'd not after long your selfe enjoy. Clor. Ha, Altemera! the sound of that name Makes burne afresh my high successlesse flame, A flame o're which deaths Coldnesse cannot reigne, Since it outbraves still her most cold disdaine. Thras. Can you reflect on her and yet not doe What honour, and revenge invites you too? Your Rivall in this Warre will growe so great, Her love to him will not be guift, but debt. Clor. I will to Lucidor a Rivall prove Greater in fame, than hee's to me in Love. Thras. Â«Now it beginns to worke.Â» Clor. Then, for my sake, Glory my cause in Love shall undertake, Whose pleading for mee shall be soe sublime, It shall say more for mee, than love for him. Thras. Will you yet take what the King offers you? Love makes you speake, but power will make you doe. Clor. Then I will make, that I may reach my end, Love, now the tyrant of my peace, my freind. I'le Court him, soe that I'le his favour find, Unlesse hee be much more unjust than blind. Thras. Your thoughts, alasse! drive you you know not where. Clor. And, which is more by much, I do not care! For my ill fate in such a way does strike, All miseries to mee are much alike. Thras. Then thinke on Love and Honour, and these may To the right side the doubtfull Ballance sway, And with your wreaths of Lawrells Mirtle mix. Clor. Come, freind! walke in; on something there I'le fix. Why was not reason, by decree of Heaven, To man for his Internall Monarch given? Our passions over itt the Conquest gett, And, as they please, they Cloud and governe it. Love, Honour, and Revenge by turnes beare sway, And all Command what they should all obey. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS SECUNDUS. [Scene I. The King's Camp.] Great shouts of Joy often repeated. Enter Clorimun, Thrasolin, Cratoner, and Monasin. Thras. The Souldiers, Sr, in this excess of noise Showes your returne brings them resembling Joyes. They think, sr, since to you their love is great, Nothing but what is such should tell you it. Clor. My Joys, like theirs, shou'd now have been sublime, Had they not brought mee to them by a crime. But since they cannot call back what is done, They must for it make their submission. This they shall doe the first of anything; Then I will forthwith send it to the King. Hee will perceive, that duty being paid, I know by Armies how to be obey'd. But where is Filadin? Hee us'd to bee The formost of my freinds to visitt mee. Crat. And soe hee now had been, but hee went hence Last night to give you some Intelligence, Such as might soone give you the meanes to show You merit the high trust you are in now. Clor. This makes his absence kindnesse, but since wee Are now encamp'd soe neere the Enemy, It were a sinn in sloth one houre to lye. Is there noe way their Courages to try? Thras. Noe way at all; the place they Campe upon, Though 'tis secur'd by natures helpe alone, Yet round it dayly their new workes appeare. Clor. Then they ev'n in their safety show their feare. Enter Filadin with a Guard, with Lucidor and Memnor Prisoners. Ha! What is this? Memnor and Lucidor! By what strange fortune are they in my pow'r? Fil. Sir, with a Party I went out to try If I cou'd take some of the Enemy. Neare to their Camp, where I lay hid last night, These two by dawne of day did come to fight, And Clatus; but when Lucidor did knowe His Mistrisse brother was to serve his foe, Hee vow'd he wou'd returne, unless that hee A Common second to them both wou'd bee; Protesting, if to that hee'd Condescend, Hee wou'd noe longer wait for his owne freind, Who, hee well knew, wou'd soone be in the feild. This high Civilitie had longer held, Had I not with my party thought it fitt To show my selfe, which quickly ended it. Clatus, the name of Quarter slighting still, Wee thought it rude to save him gainst his will. The selfe same way these two had also tooke, Had not their swords, while they were fighting, broke. Luc. If Filadin had not us death deny'd, And had not fortune too joyn'd on his side, Wee shou'd not now (soe justly bonds we hate) Have been the tame beholders of our fate. Mem. Fortune, not wee, shou'd for our losse be blam'd, Which wee'l soe bravely beare, shee'l be asham'd; And whilst her unjuste frownes wee suffer thus, Wee'l triumph over her, not shee on Us. Clor. Brave Filadin, I'm thine Eternally! [Imbraces Filadin. Lead Memnor to my tentâhee bleeds, I seeâ And bid my Chyrurgions that care on him show They'l have of mee, when I am wounded too. Noe other Prison but your word I crave. Mem. That is the strongest Prison I can have. Clor. Yet that the easiest is in my Power. All leave the tent but only Lucidor. Fil. Lett us three then retire into my tent, And there letts have a little merriment. [Exeunt. Manent Clor. and Luc. Clor. Mee thinks a Sadnesse sitts upon your brow, Which misbecomes one soe much lov'd as you. Your Mistrisse Love to mee wou'd bring releife In all the wounds of Fortune and of greife. Luc. If any Sadnesse in my face appeares, It is not on my owne accompt, but her's; That fortune shou'd be tyranous to him Whome Altemera does not disesteeme. Clor. Rather lett Altemera see in this Fortune, by much, the lesser goddesse is. Had fate to place me in thy Joy thought fitt, I wou'd doe nothing else but thinke on it. Nay, even I my sleepe would not esteeme, If I shou'd not reflect on't, while I dreame. Luc. Though you did this, and more, yet you'd doe lesse Than I in prizing of that happinesse. You show the low esteeme of it you hold By thinking 'tis a blessing can be told. Clor. And yet, mee thinks, your present looke affords That which but too much contradicts your words. But tell mee, pray, does Altemera still Enjoy the pow'r of conquering whome shee will? Luc. Shee does, and her bright Eyes still shoot such fire, All want the pow'r to shunne it, as desire; Her beauties to behold and not to Love, A wonder, great as they themselves, wou'd prove. In all things else, 'tis Ignorance alone Hinders our making their discription, But, in this case, her beauties such are growne, Knowledge is lost in admiration. Clor. Great Gods, why are the Starrs fixt in such height That wee can only see their beautious light, And Altemera, with more lustre grac'd, Within my Rivalls reach by you is plac'd? Why was there soe much giv'n to her, and shee Permitted too to give it all to thee? But Lucidor, you bleed. Had I your wound But sooner seene, you shou'd have sooner found, What's deare by nature to her, I'de not owne More than what's soe by Inclination. Luc. This scratch, which you call wound, you much miscall. 'Tis my great trouble that it is soe small. Clor. You to my admiration alwaies are Speakeing the dismall language of dispaire, Which Altemera's power seems to decline. At least I shou'd thinke soe, were thy fate mine. [Exeunt. [Scene II. Filadin's Tent in the King's Camp.] Enter Filadin, Monasin, and Cratoner. Fil. Lett us then of our mistresses discourse. Mon. You could not name a subject pleas'd mee worse. Yes, I must hate them, for they have their Eyes To move them still the handsome men to prize. They have their Eares too in their numerous fits To make them Love and doat upon the witts. They have their fancies too, I my selfe know itt, To make them love th'inventions of the Poett. Nay, were all these Center'd in one, they then Have their inconstancy to love all men. Fil. That which in them thou as a Vice doest grant Is what I'de quarrel with them, did they want. Their ficklenesse I thinke a virtue rare. Long none I keepe, nor of none long dispaire. In mee a greater trouble it wou'd breed, If they still lov'd than if they never did. Their kindnesse cannot be a Joy soe high, As afterwards is their Inconstancie. Such quitting mee is what I most esteeme. They doe to mee what I wou'd doe to them. Their Change for new Amours a way does make, Ridds mee of her I tooke, brings her I'de take. But if these truths, which I to thee have said, Doe want the pow'r thy reason to persuade, And that thou yet will to fix weomen try, Which harder is than to fix mercury, Then marry. Mon. Marry! that, all wise men say, Is to unfix them the most certaine way! Experience showes that Women are much more Unfixt after their marriage than before. All ties in Love but Love, that power doe want, And even are defective in the grant. Crat. Marry! that is needlesse, for if Love Comands Their hearts to Joyne, they need noe nuptiall bands, And if Love does not, those will hold them ill. They are or needlesse or weake fetters still, Things which but fright such as want witt to see They are noe substance but a mysterie. Mon. An Art found out by ugly men, or old, Who, wanting naturall Charmes to take and hold The young and handsome, by constraint did fail To find out bands are artificiall. Fil. My worthy and good freinds, pray spare your paines! I loath soe perfectly those horrid Chaines That I had rather much you two to see Thrice married than that once you shou'd see mee. Crat. Wee thanke you, Sir, but yet it has been said You lately were faire Calanns to wedd. Fil. Because a man was nere being hang'd, is't fitt To thinke that therefore he was pleas'd with itt? Come! thinke on Daphnis. Mon. Shee's a witt, reads books, And her words are more hansome than her looks. That woman's brought to an unhappy passe When that her tongue is the best part shee has. I thinke to praise a Taverne is as fitt, For having Water, as a Woman, Witt. They doubtlesse shou'd with other charmes be grac'd. I grant the thing is good, but there misplac'd. Think on Amanta, shee is very rich. Crat. Her Gold may charme, her Eyes will ne'er bewitch! Faith! shee's not old enough, for I esteeme A womans midle age her worst extreame. In every season else wish has some scope; In Youth ther's certainty, in age ther's hope. Shee's old enough ugly to be, I knowe; And young enough too long to live soe too. And to discribe her truly, that wc h frights Is much more vissible than what invites. Her wealth I love, her lookes that Love destroy. The grapes are painted worse than is the boy. Thinke then on Cloris, who does Lovely owne A Maids cheife beautie is discretion. Mon. She vainly hopes her Lovers to persuade By her discretion, now her beauties fade. Love ugly Women makes discreet, I knowe, Or rather uglinesse does make men soe. To Uglynesse nature such strength imparts, To make it tenable, it needs not Arts. Thinke on Calione, shee's wondrous faire, And carries in her face a Conquering ayre. Fil. Prethee, noe further in her praise proceed, For on that aire shee'd have her servants feed. My Love with that thinn diett shee did treate, And when I begg'd some more substantiall meate, The very naming it shee scarce endur'd; Soe Love like agues was by starving cur'd. Shee's a Platonick or at least a foole. I prais'd her body, and shee prais'd her soule. Mon. Thinkst thou that a Platonick is a foole? Knowe 'tis the subtlest sect in Cupids schoole. She who does once resigne mee up her soule All feares to misse her body does controle, And by it many a well meaning Maid Has, as I know, her body oft betraid. 'Tis but a veile, suspitious men to blind. None feares to be a Cuckold of the mind. Thinke then on Flora, shee sings sweet and cleare. Crat. Love enters at the Eye, not at the Eare; But I can Love none, for the faire are wonne By too much time; the rest are gain'd too soone. My stomack's nice, and if too long I'me cross'd In what I'de tast, my appitite is lost. I loath food needs much Cooking; if the meat Were ready when I'de have it, I could eate. Thinke on Arthiopa, for in her face Sadnesse has soe much Empire and such Grace That I cou'd never tell whether her sight Did more forbidd my Passion, or invite. Mon. Alasse! my freind, I did discover soone Shee by approaches only cou'd be wonn. And you well knowe what I in Love performe Is not by teadious seiges, but by storme. Her Coynesse made mee all her sex abjure. Where kindnesse is not, reason is my cure. Fil. Come! lett's be going, for I shrewdly feare, If those wee talk'd of, our discourse shou'd heare, Reason from them will this beliefe require,â Where there is soe much smoke there is some fire. Mon. Since they will have us tell lyes to their face, Yet, when their backs be turn'd, let truth take place. The Common proverbe too wee else shou'd breake, By which the loosers still have leave to speake. Enter Thrasolin. Thras. Is this a time to spend in merryment When thrice the Generall has for you sent? I have at least this houre been round about The Campe, endeavouring to find you out. Crat. You needed not have fetch'd soe long a walke. This is our usuall place to meet and talke. But doe you knowe what 'tis we are to doe? Thras. I guesse, but knowe not if my guesse be true. Soone after from the Generall you went, There came one in disguise into his tent, Who to him some Intelligence did give From Mora, where his Mistresse now does live. I saw him very Joyfull at the News, And after on it hee a while did muse, Hee with some Earnistnesse Commanded mee To call all you to him imediatly. Mon. If this be the designe, who ever goes For hop'd for honour will have certaine Blowes. Our Generall will lead on like a Sprite, When he does both for Love and honour fight. Fil. Good Man, he but for one wench fights, but when Wee take the place, each of Us will have tenn! When townes are conquer'd by the force of Warre, Walls first are storm'd and then the Women are. [Exeunt. [Scene III. The King's Camp.] Enter Clorimun and one of Altemera's Guards. Clor. What shall be thy Reward? Why, it shall be Much more than thou thy selfe canst hope from mee! But for thy owne, as well as for my sake, Faile not in that thou now dost undertake. Guard. Sr, 'tis my nearest freind and I of late Have left unto our Charge the posterne Gate, Next to your Campe, where, if you are inclin'd To storme the place, you shall admittance find. But, Sr, your party must be very stronge, For all which to our Garrison belong Are of the Rebells force the very flower, And chosen out as such by Lucidor. Clor. Though every Souldier now in Mora were A Lucidor him selfe, I would not care. I ne're saw those whom my sword did not fright, When I for Glory or for Love did fight. And in this Action I have now in hand, Fighting for both, who can my arme withstand? Enter Thrasolin, Filadin, Monasin, and Cratoner. Comand out streight three thousand men dare goe Where I their Generall their way will showe, Men who their lives their owne will not esteeme, When either fame, or I have need of them. Lett them be all in Armes by fall of night. The Glory of the attempt shall be my light. Thras. May you not, Sr, your enterprise reveale? Clor. It is on Mora where my fate does dwell. Thras. That place, Sr, is impregnable, I feare. Clor. Nothing is soe, butt the bright Beauty there. Oh, would to heaven I only were as farre Above all feares in love as feares in warre! Successe shall now, where I intend to goe, A greater Blessing than itt's selfe bestowe. [Exeunt. [Scene IV. A Chamber in Altemera's Palace.] Enter Altemera and Candaces. Alt. Oh, my Candaces! I did still esteeme That was a vision, which thou calls't a dreame, And nothing made mee thinke the last itt was, Butt, when I saw him to the Scaffold passe, And there undauntedly to loose his head, That fatall blow struck mee nott alsoe dead. Cand. Yor Greifs, I grant, are just for Lucidor, Since hee is now within his Rivalls power, Butt yett this, Madam, may your greifs subdue,â As hee's his foe, soe hee's yor Lover too. The name of Rivall threatens noe such ill, Butt that of Lover is above itt still. Alt. Alas! Candaces, thou in this hast showne The boundles power of Love thou ne'ere hast knowne! Love is a passion still, and that's the cause 'Twill nott bee rul'd by reasons certaine Lawes. Love is compos'd of riddles and excesse. Oft 'twill doe more than reason, oftener lesse. Hee that will freely dye att my Command Will, in some cases, even my feares withstand, And firmely thinkes hee does more love dispense In his deniall, than obedience. The Justice of those thinges wc h I approve, Hee measures more by reason than by Love. Cand. Ah! Madam, thinke nott I a stranger am To love, and onely know him butt by name; Yett I have felt his power, and in such height, All wounds besides, compar'd to mine, are slight. Never did love till now inflict such woes. I burne, butt dare nott my feirce flames disclose. Alt. Your case I pitty; therfore lett mee know The persons name wc h has inflam'd you soe. Perhaps my helpe may bringe you some releif, And if nott cure, att least may ease your greif. Cand. Your helpe, I know, the powerfull'st will appeare, Butt my case is above all helpe, I feare. Alt. May I nott doubt, since Love with soe much pow're Invades yor heart, itt burnes for Lucidor? Cand. Were I a man, his fate, I must confesse, I would imbrace as the first happinesse; For even as I am, I never knew What joy meant, till I gave my selfe to you; And were I sure to have a larger part, Than Lucidor possesses of yor heart, To make that noblest Empire soe much mine, I thinke I shou'd all other aimes decline. Alt. This flattering answer you returne to mee Makes what was butt a doubt a certainty. Blush nott that I to light this truth have brought. Yor Love is a misfortune, nott a fault; And how can I in you that passion blame, When I too burne in that resistlesse flame? Cand. Thinke nott what I as a high truth did tell Was an imagin'd passion to conceale. Butt all yor Doubts intirely to remove, I sweare that Lucidor I doe nott love, And since I wou'd be first in yor Esteeme, Hee being soe, I cannott sure love him. I tell you who 'tis nott, and if I doe E're tell who 'tis, itt shall bee first to you. If you aske further, I must disobey. Lett mee in silence mourne my life away. Alt. 'Twere rudenesse then further to presse you now. Butt tell mee, pray, since to Loves power you bow, Wou'd you yor life, to save yor Lover, give? Cand. Wou'd I! more willingly than I would live! Alt. Butt could ought make you yor Loves hopes depose? Cand. A thousand lives I loose sooner than those; And though faint hopes are all I can call mine, Yett for a world those hopes I'de nott decline. Alt. Judge then, Candaces, by what now you say, If Clorimun will my desire obey. Cand. Ah, give mee leave to say itt is a crime To thinke that any passion equalls mine. In such a way love does my brest inspire, Other loves are butt warmth, butt mine a fire. Butt 'tis a fire soe pleasing and soe high, That, Martyr like, I triumph while I die. [Weepes. A hott Alarum. One cries out within: âArme, Arme, Arme, the sally port is won, And the fierce Enemy is in the Towne.â Alt. Alas! Candaces, what noise is't I heare, Which does my trembling heart wound through my eare? Enter a page hastily. Page. Fly, Madam, Fly, or else you are undone; The Towne is now possesst by Clorimun. In vaine yor Souldiers have his armes withstood; Dead bodies pave the Streetes, wc h run with bloud. Hundreds have from his sword receiv'd their fates, And hee is now entring yor palace gates. Alt. Great Gods, what sins are Lucidor's and mine, Which makes you to us both such fates assigne? Butt you are just, and therfore I'le nott feare You'le lay on us above what wee can beare. A Noyse att the Doore and Clorimun speaking to his Officers. Clor. Your valeurs wages the whole Towne shall bee, Butt heere resides shee that's ador'd by mee. Lett noe rude feete presume to enter heere, And lett noe dying cries offend her eare. Enter Clorimun with his sword bloody. Pardon mee, Altemera, that I dare, Before your innocence, guilt's livery weare. And yett that sin you needes must thinke itt lesse, Than by itt I enjoy of happinesse. Since fate did mee soe longe from you divorce, Itt did provoke mee to make use of force. This action you shou'd nott condemne, butt prize, Since 'tis th'effect of your triumphant eyes. Alt. You raise mee only to a higher State, Therby your owne sin to extenuate. Those Gods wc h wee adore have never sent Their punishments uppon the innocent. Butt those sad cryes, wc h in my eares still sound, By sympathy much worse than death doe wound. Clor. I have already orders sent to sheath The souldiers swords on paine of instant death, And to acquaint the living that they owe Only to yor commands their being soe. Butt, Madam, is itt just that you shou'd shed Such pretious showers for those that are butt dead, And that my case, which does much worse appeare, Cannott, to give itt ease, obtaine one teare? Those which are kill'd are from all ills releast, And from their Troubles are redeem'd to rest, Butt my deepe miseries know noe Reprieve. A thousand deaths I die and yett still live. My waking thoughts my paine still freshe does keepe, Nor are my dreames lesse torturing when I sleepe. Joy does your Clorimun soe dissesteeme, Hee cannott tast itt though butt in a dreame. Alt. In common sufferinges there is some releif In teares, the common Evidence of greif; But, cou'd you see within my brest, you'd finde Your sufferinges have the sorrow of my minde, Which rather shou'd induce you to deplore What I now beare, than load mee yett with more. The grossest thinges our senses entertaine; The most refin'd, invisible remaine. Clor. Yett, Madam, love still takes delight to give, By publique actinges, proofs that itt does live. To the blest person wc h your Love does sway You wou'd nott practice that which now you say. That is weake love, by all 'twill bee confest, Which can bee still confin'd within the brest, And ever in surprizes is soe aw'de That itt does courage want to looke abroad. A perfect flame all thinges does gett above; Reason itt rules, or turnes itt into love. 'Tis absolute, what ever itt will doe, Butt that itt never can itt self subdue. Butt I misspend this pretious time, I see, In teaching Love to her, that taught itt mee. Alt. From that Truth, Clorimun, confesse I know More of Loves power and actinges than you doe. Were love Corporeall, doubtlesse then the breast Wou'd bee too small, to lodge soe great a Guest. Acting is nott itt's naturall agree; Oft itt is choice, oft 'tis necessity. That friendshipp I on Clorimun bestow Is as neare love, as ought that is nott soe. And that itt is nott love, I had nott knowne, Butt that my heart I can butt give to one. Clor. Cruell as faire, my flame thus to deride, Cou'd you have found noe other way beside To tell mee how much you on mee bestow, Butt how much more 'tis you have giv'n my foe? Spight of yor scorne, yor beauties I'le adore. 'Tis past my power to love you lesse or more. Butt from yor vast disdaine this good I'le gett, Fully to prove my love as vaster yett. I'le Court you soe, that I att length will prove You're mine by right, and onely his by Love. Enter Thrasolin. Thras. Gesippus, Sr, is come post from the Kinge, And does such pressing orders to you bringe, That with impatience hee bid mee say, To speake with you, hee in the streete does stay. Clor. Gesippus come, and come in such hast too! Pardon mee, madame, that I leave you now. Alt. Alasse! your virtue only can controll Those feares his comeing gives my frighted Soule. Clor. Faire Altemera, quiet all your feares. 'Tis I am yours, not you my Prisoner. And where I beare Command, you have more pow'r Than were you in the Camp of Lucidor. [Exeunt Clor. and Thras. Alt. Ah! Sure hee knew, though he would not confesse The true cause of those feares I did expresse, Which Justly doe my greifes the more advance. His answere was his Craft, not Ignorance; And nought soe soone cou'd bring Gesippus here But to act that which more than death I feare. Use all wayes, my Candaces, to find out If that is Certaintie, which yet is doubt. Those plagues, which fortune on my freind has throwne, Give mee not leisure to deplore my owne. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS TERTIUS. [Scene I. A Street in Mora.] Enter Thrasolin hastily and meetes Monasin, Filadin, and Cratoner. Thras. Your souldiers draw under their Collours straight, And send a hundred more to every gate. Then let a Guard be of a thousand made, Which you three shall Command at the Parade. Lucidor from the Campe is hither ledd, And by the Kings Command must loose his head. Gesippus in the Garrison has staid To see these orders instantly obey'd. Crat. Brave Newes! his death cutts off all hopes of peace. Mon. I rather feare 'twill make all difference cease. Fil. If thou thinkst soe, sett him at Libertie. 'Tis better hee shou'd live than our trade dye. Thras. Candaces now from Altemera came, Who begg'd our Generall in her Ladies name, That hee himselfe would take the paines to goe And speake with her before the fatall Blow. This with a Lovers duty hee obey'd, But all that shee can say will ne'er perswade, For ere the Generall to his Mistresse went, The orders for his death to mee hee sent. [Exeunt. [Scene II. A Chamber in Altemera's Palace.] Enter Altemera. Alt. Great Gods, is sacred Love such an offence That for it you to mee such Plagues dispence? But if my constancy provoke your hate, I will endure but not deplore my fate. Enter Candaces. Cand. The Generall does your Commands obey, And at the doore, to waite on you, does stay. Alt. Admitt him, though his sight augment my greife. If hee denies mee, death is my releife. [Exit Cand. Enter Clorimun. Fortune, brave Clorimun, has now design'd A noble rise to show your nobler mind, For by your Kings Insatiate Crueltie I heare that Lucidor's condemn'd to die. 'Tis in your power his death now to decline, But if you act it, none can hinder mine. My life and his are with such strictnesse bound, That, to end both, you need but give one wound. But, Clorimun, it is a nobler thing To save that rivall than obey that King. I knowe your virtue therefore will not Shunne To tell you Lucidor my heart has wonn, Soe that to him if I shou'd prove untrue, I thereby shou'd become unworthy you. Clor. Madame, cou'd you noe other way have found But by my virtue thus my Love to wound? But since to it soe cruell now you prove, I renounce virtue, I am all but Love; Or if I any virtue still enjoy, 'Tis not soe much as must my Love destroy. Alt. Who but by virtue doe to Love pretend Forsakes the way, and yet pursues the End. Clor. And you wou'd have me by what now you say Forsake the end and yet pursue the way. Alt. Hee who his Mistrisse favour cannot gett Ought to be pleas'd that hee does meritt itt. Clor. To misse the purchace and yet pay the price Makes virtue more unfortunate than vice. It's not enough my Rivall must have you, Butt you will make mee helpe him to you too! Alt. It were enough; nay, 'twere too much, I knowe, For any but for Clorimun to doe, Whose virtue is soe eminent and Cleere That Common arts below it wou'd appeare. To any other I'd conceale my fire, Since owning it might hinder my desire. But while high things I wou'd have you bestow, I scorne to seek them in a way that's low. Your granting my request, knowing my flame, Will add the greater lustre to your fame. This way in which I aske a guift soe great Helps mee to pay as well as make the Debt. Clor. This, Madame, which with soe much art you word, But cutts my hopes off with a glittering sword. You make my virtue great that it may prove A surer way but to destroy my love. I'le mourne I grant not that for wc h you presse; More to obey you were to love you lesse. Who can see beauties wc h soe brightly shine And to a Rivall all his hopes resigne? Conceale your Eyes, whilst you such grants pursue. Those plead for mee more than your Prayers for you, To prove you in the wrong, mee in the right. Noe Judge needs more, but not to want his sight. Alt. If this mean beautie be esteem'd by you, To preserve it you must preserve him too; For it must still be his, I'le not deny. For him it lives and with him it must die. Clor. In Rivallshipp two Passions only move,â That great one of Revenge; that greater, love. And, Madame, if you make mee soe accurst, As to deny the last, I'le take the first. Alt. His death is in your power but not in mine. What does incense you to it to decline? A Conquest o're the first, in you, to winne Is vertue; o're the last, in mee, were sinne. But if to my affection you pretend, This is the certaine way to misse your end. By it your Rivalls hopes will be o'rethrowne, But you thereby cannot advance your owne. If I his Love, while you are just, preferre, Can I doe yours when you'r his murtherer? Clor. Since I must misse that Joy for which I sue, 'Tis some to make my Rivall misse it too. A double ruine you on mee wou'd bring, To loose at once my Mistresse and my King. Alt. Your King through Lucidor does mee assault. Make mee his punishment, since I'me his fault. That which his hate to Lucidor does move Is that hee stands betwixt him and my Love. Since against honor I'le not act a cryme, To be reveng'd on mee, hee'l ruine him. Act not a sinne which needs must let me see Your hate for him transcends your love for mee. Suppresse that fury which soe high does burne, And let my prayers your hate to pitty turne. Clor. How can I pitty such a mans estate, With whom I willingly would change my fate? One houre to have possesst your Love as hee Possesses it, I'de dye imediatly. What greater Joy can hee begg from above Than, while hee is alive, to have your Love? Enter Page hastily, and Cratoner. Page. Madame, my hast has made mee out of breath. I saw ev'n now Lucidor ledd to death, And if his Pardon be not sent him now, 'Twill come too late to stopp the fatall Blow. Alt. Oh, Clorimun! if this poore Life you prize, Then you will show it in preserving his. Looke on these teares a while; then I'le retire, And leave you to what virtue shall inspire. But be assur'd of this: that very breath Which tells mee my freind's dead, shall act my death. [Exeunt Alt. and Page. Clor. Goe, stopp the Execution till I come. [Exit Cratoner. What a fierce Warre is in this narrow roome! Duty to the Kings Orders makes it fitt Hee dye; my owne revenge too joynes with itâ Revenge which is soe pleasing and soe sweete, The Gods to keepe it for themselves thinke meetâ And, above all Revenges, that in Love Does the most Just and the most pleasing prove. But yet noe duty nor revenge must stand In Competition with her least Command. Shee never shall in mee have cause to blame But the aspireing of a hopelesse flame. I'le save my Rivall and make her confesse 'Tis I deserve what hee does but possesse. [Exit. Enter Altemera. Alt. Death which mankind in such high awe does keepe Can only hold Us in Eternall Sleepe, And if a Life after this Life remaines, Sure to our Loves belongs those happie plaines. There in blest feilds I'le passe the endlesse houres, And him I crowne with Love, I'le crowne with flowers, A Crowne which more true Joy than Lawrell brings, Or that bright Earth which circles heads of Kings. Either my fancie does delude my Eyes, Or I behold my freind ascend the Skies. His spirit now from Cloggs of flesh sett free Invites mee to his immortalitie. Mee thinks I see him in those shades of rest, And as much Monarch there, as in my breast. My tortur'd soule does with Impatience stay, And longs to follow where hee leads the way. Enter Candaces hastily. Cand. Your Commands, Madame, have a boundlesse pow'r. They have preserv'd your much lov'd Lucidor. Of his reprieve I did my selfe dispaire. The fatall Axe was lifted in the Aire, And ready was to fall, when Clorimun Appear'd and staid the Execution. Gesippus said hee in his cryme was lost, And then for Leptis instantly tooke post. The Generall whisper'd Filadin in th'Eare, And is himselfe, Madame, now coming here. Alt. This Charming newes my teares have wip'd away. Enter Page. Page. Madame, the Generall at your doore does stay, And to waite on you humbly does desire. Alt. Admitt him. May kind Heaven my tongue inspire! What shall I doe for him obleig'd mee soe? Cand. All but what you'll refuse hee'l thinke too low. Alt. Hee cannot thinke that I ungratefull prove, If I in admiration pay his Love. Enter Clorimun. You have obleig'd mee to the last degree. More than your sword your vertues conquer mee; And in that noble acting you have showne Your foes you can subdue more wayes than one. Clor. Whatever I for Altemera doe Is in it selfe reward and duty too. I come more proofes of this to let you see, And not to heare from you my Elogie. I doubt Gesippus words will take such place The King will mee imediatly disgrace. Then for my Rivalls death hee'l orders give, Soe that I shall not save him but reprieve. His losse I knowe, Madame, will make you dye. Therefore I have sett him at Libertie, And, fearing what th'usurpers rage might doe, Have given your brother Memnor freedome too. All that I thought you wish'd, I have made good; One to your Love I give, one to your blood. Alt. Ah, Noble Clorimun! Why have you tooke A course which further must your king provoke? You might with privacy have let them goe, And by your safetie rais'd the favour too. Clor. Honour and Love my actions still shall guide. What's duty to obey 'tis sinn to hide. I'le make it to the world and you appeare, To serve you is my glory, not my feare. I to retirement know the way againe, And there I'le waite till Melizer does Reigne, Whose virtues are soe great, his right soe good, Hee should bee King by choice as well as bloud. Alt. Since you those truths soe fully understand, And that a Conquering Army you Command, Nobly then at the head of it appeare To save your selfe and restore Melizer. If to performe this duty you thinke fitt, Memnor and Lucidor shall Joyne in itt. Clor. Justice herselfe wou'd blush, shou'd shee receive A right which treachery does to her give, And virtuous Melizer wou'd never owne From falsehood the possession of the Throne. Disgrace I feare lesse than to be unjust. 'Tis such to take and then betray a trust. Though I my power and Melizer esteeme, Yet I love honour more than power or him. Next to your favour, what I covett most Is to restore to him that Crowne hee lost. But as my case is, all brave men will owne 'Tis sinne to talk of't, till to do't is none. Alt. O noble virtue, great enough alone The whole World to supply if it had none! What I propos'd I cannot but recant; Soe to deny is nobler than to grant. Preserve your Power that Melizer you may In a fitt Season serve in honours way. Clor. When I with honour may his title owne, It will not need Solicitation. But to the King, Madame, I now will goe, And there strive to prevent my overthrowe. But if I am disgrac'd, you'll then thinke meet To let mee breath my passions at your feete, Which is a Glory I shall prize above All blessings else, except it be your Love. Alt. Goe, noble Clorimun, and may you there Meet with Successe which may remove your feare. May the Gods pay you all you doe for mee, And make your Joyes vast as your bounties bee. Clor. You cannot aske more Joyes for mee, you knowe, Than of your selfe you can on mee bestowe. Permitt mee, madame, now to let you in, And then my Jorney forthwith I'le beginne. [Exeunt. [Scene III. A Chamber in the King's Palace at Leptis.] Enter King and Gesippus. King. His getting Altemera in my power Outweighs not what hee did for Lucidor,â To save that Rebell, and then sett him free! Told you him all you had in charge from mee? Ges. I did, Sir, and repeatedly did say Hee wou'd be ruin'd did he disobey. But what I prest noe more returnes did find, Than had my words been spoken to the winde. If you delay revenging this one houre, You may be King in name, but not in power. King. His folly never flew soe high before. Ges. Hee durst not doe soe much and doe noe more. 'Tis plaine, since hee refuses your Command, Hee has some greater Wickednesse in hand, And I much doubt those which hee has set free Are with him now, Joyn'd in Conspiracy. King. His cryme makes it unfitt hee keepe his place, But hee'l not act, I'me sure, whats false or base. That pride which made him doe what hee has done Will make him low and treacherous actings shunne. Ges. You must about you looke immediatly, Else you will feele those mischeifes I foresee. Enter Captaine of the Guards hastily. I wish your greatest hast come not too late. Capt. The Generall, Sr, is lighted at the Gate. King. Who? Clorimun? Capt. Yes, Sir. King. Sure thou dost dreame! Didst see him? Capt. Yes, and more I spoke with him! Hee told mee he is come from Mora post. King. How many came with him? Capt. But six at most. King. Keep him in talke, till I two minuts winne To order my designes; then bring him in. [Exit Capt. I must gett Altemera in my power. Who did hee make of Mora Governor? Ges. 'Tis Filadin, if I doe not mistake. King. Thou must to him all expedition make. Tell him, if hee his King does Love or feare, Hee must this night bring Altemera here, And tell him too, if hee does disobey, His Generalls life shall his refusall pay. In this great trust show that thou art my freind; Bidd all my Guards immediatly attend. [Exit Gesippus. You sacred powers, to whome my heart is knowne, You knowe that cheifly I usurp the Throne But with more hopes to have successe in Love A Monarch's power can only gett above. What Altemera has too often showne Is Lucidors by Inclination. Enter Clorimun and the Captaine of the Guards. You have soe long in Armies had the sway That you have quite forgotten to obey. When Lucidor I had Condemn'd to die, You sav'd his Life, then gave him Libertie, And, as if this were not enough for you, I heare that Memnor has his freedome too. Clor. Sr, I did hope you wou'd not have thought fitt To reproach mee for what Love did committ. I never had th'ambition'd meanes before, Since I faire Altemera did adore, But in my tedious sufferings to prove The cleerenesse and the vastnesse of my Love. Twice I a Prisoner may make Lucidor, But to deny her once I wanted power. This Warre will dayly new ocasions bring To show how I delight to serve my King, But if I had deny'd her first request, I with a second never had been blest. King. I doe not wonder you have dissobey'd One who you thought cou'd with such words be paid. Noe, no, I know your Rivall you did spare, For feare his death too soone shou'd end the Warre, And then the ground of all your pride wou'd cease, Which you more value than your Countries peace. Clor. 'Tis hard that hee who did retir'dly dwell, And to obey you only left his Cell, Shou'd now have that obedience term'd his pride, Which had been Judg'd Rebellion, if deny'd. My Countries peace I thinke the highest good, And, to restore it, have not spar'd that bloud Which but too clearely now I see you hate, Else you would not have us'd mee at this rate. King. I see you still are what I knew you first. To name your faults is for your bloud to thirst. I have small hopes of you, when you decline What is as much your interest as mine. You'l save your Rivall rather than you'l doe That which your King strictly Comands you too. Clor. What in this act but Love cou'd be my end, Which did my Rivall save, my King offend? Enter some of the Guards. King. I doubt it will too evidently prove, That is your treachery, you call your Love. Clor. My treachery! durst any but my King Such an aspersion on my honour fling, Though Armies to secure him had Combin'd, Yet through them all this sword a way should find,â This Sword which sav'd your life twice in one day, And, when death seiz'd you, frightned him away, This Sword on which Successe did still attend, And to enthrone you was your powerfullest freind. Reproach for this is a Reward unfitt! King. Thou payest thy selfe in often telling it. Were all those duties thou to mee didst pay Put in one scale, this cryme would them out weigh. Thinke not such ruffling words will alter mee! I say againe, it is thy treachery! Clor. Why doe the Gods give only him the will To wrong mee, whome alone I dare not kill? If ever I a treacherous act have done, 'Tis to that treacherous act you owe your crowne! King. Unsay those saucy words which thou hast sed, Or, for thy tongues offense, I'le take thy head! Clor. Fright Women with such menaces, but I Will loose my head, ere a truth told deny! King. You thinke you'r in your mutinous Army now, But you are in my power, I'le make you knowe! Clor. I thinke that none will doubt I might have still Been in the Camp, if that had been my will. If in your power I am, then learne from thence That I depended on my Innocence. The folly had surpass'd the fancied Sinne To yeild myselfe upp, had I guilty been. King. The Gods therein show thee thy lost Estate. Those they would ruine, they infatuate. Clor. That often is their way to reach their end. Therefore take heed you loose not such a freind. King. By rend'ring thus thyselfe, they rather show How fitt it is I cutt off such a foe. Clor. If to give up my selfe my choice I make, Then 'tis an easy thing my head to take. But if I am resolv'd my head to keepe, Who takes it off must make an Army sleepe,â That Army wc h my absence did soe fire, They made you call mee back, yourselfe retire. If they did thus my power but to restore, Thinke you to save my Life they'd not doe more! Mora is not lesse strong than Leptis is. Those who tooke that, can, if they please, take this! King. Dost thou first Injure and then threaten mee? Disarme that Traytor, Guards, imediatly! [The Guards surprise and disarme Clorimun. Clor. Ungratefull Prince! 'twill be your foes delight That your left hand thus does cutt off your right. In this low act for them you doe much more Than I have done in freeing Lucidor. King. Rage has transported thee to that degree Thou hast forgott my Guards have seiz'd on thee. Clor. Did I not more your name than Guards esteeme, I'de make you tremble in the midst of them! Often ere now, without boast I may say, I drove, when single, more than these away. Numbers makes you secure in what you doe, And, if I please, know I have numbers too. Usurpers merritt never did regard, But punnish worth wc h is above reward. King. To the Black Tower let him forthwith be ledd, Whence none comes out unlesse to lose his head. And since my favours find such a returne, That goodnesse hee abus'd, hee now shall mourne; Let him with noe man speake or see the day. If he escape, thy Life for it shall pay. [Exit. [Guards offer to seize Clorimun. Clor. I'le strangle any dares lay hands on mee! I am resolv'd to goe, and I'le goe free! [Exeunt. [Scene IV. A Street in Mora.] Enter Monasin, Filadin, and Cratoner. Crat. What ever it is thou dost advise Us too, Wee will not only thinke on it, but doe. Fil. Bravely resolv'd! then let noe time be lost, But let each of Us hasten to his post. You two shall in disguise to Leptis goe. Thence lett mee hourely all that passes know. I feare the Generalls open nature may, By the Kings arts, his Innocence betray, And when hee has the power his head to take, Hee at the Sinne will not much scruple make. Mon. If the Usurpers rage shou'd rise soe high, We have not yet forgott to Mutiny, And, rather than that Losse wee will endure, For our last ill wee'l practice our first Cure. [Exeunt. [Scene V. A Chamber in the King's Palace.] Enter King and Gesippus. Ges. I left her, Sir, in my appartment now, And came to knowe what further I must doe. King. Though to thy freindshipp I my Crowne must owne, This service yett transcends all thou hast done. Life, Empire, and all blessings else must prove Below the vast importance of my Love. Waite on her hither straight, whilst I reflect What raptures Love will bring, what greifes neglect. [Exitt Gesippus. This heart the feare of death could ne're invade, Now trembles to behold that Conquering Maid. But yet 'twere sinne that trembling to bemoane, Since my Love by it is the cleerer showne. What e're my passion does discover most Ought not to make my sorrow but my boast. Enter Gesippus, Altemera, and Candaces. Alt. Oh, Sir, I'me told, since I came to this place, That Clorimun is soe in your disgrace, That hee is like (such your resentments be) To loose his life for what hee did for mee. Since 'twas my teares made him his fault committ, I'le strive by them to make you pardon itt. Therefore upon my knees I humbly crave [Kneeles. That you at least his pretious Life will save. King. Faire Altemera, rise; this shou'd not bee. 'Tis I should kneel to you, not you to mee. Could you have found noe other way beside, But this, my deepe obedience to have try'd? Command mee to subdue Rome by a Warr, And I'le doe that rather than this by farr. Alt. To Conquer Empires is what force may doe, But 'tis your virtue must yourselfe subdue. If you deny my first and only suite, My knees shall never rise, but here take roote. King. I cannot Altemera's teares withstand. His Life I give, Madame, to your Command. Alt. 'Tis nobler much to spare than to shedd bloud. [Rises. Noe title sounds soe great as that of good. King. Since to Shun mercy you esteeme a fault, Doe not decline that virtue you have taught, And since I sav'd a Rebell at your prayer, Let not your King, adoring you, dispaire. His person I must for a while confine. 'Tis for my Rivalls safety as for myne. Alt. His freedome I will hope for in due time. Now to begg more you might esteeme a Cryme. King. 'Twere a Cryme, Madame, in mee, I know, To keepe you longer from your Lodgings now. I have a high important bussinesse there, Fit only to be Whisper'd in your Eare. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS QUARTUS. [Scene I. A Chamber in the King's Palace.] Enter King and Gesippus. King. Oh freind! I now feele Loves true fires within. That is turn'd virtue, which at first was sinne. Such charmes in honour shee to mee did show, I adore hers more than her beautie now. Shee that has in her King this great change bredd, As a reward deserves to share his bedd. Thinke not th'unequallnesse shall mee dissuade. Custome, not reason, has that distance made. Worse than a subjects case a Kings wou'd prove, If he must wedd by rules of state, not Love. Ges. What is become of that vast reason now, To wc h, more than your Sword, nations did bow? O! wrong not thus the Glory of your name, Nor to your pleasure sacrifice your fame. King. Who'le blame mee if my case hee rightly state, Since Love than titles beares an elder date? Love is great natures first and noblest Lawe; At onne with force and pleasure it does draw. Ges. This way of reasoning, wc h you soe esteeme, Is in it selfe only a wakeing dreame. Pardon mee if I say, to keepe your throne, You need your neighbours Army and your owne. Thousands doe now their swords against you drawe, And say you sit in it, by force, not Lawe. From all their mouths you nothing else can heare But that your crimes alone have plac'd you there. King. What ever crymes are acted for a Crowne The Gods forgive, when once they put it on. To their high Justice 'twere a disrespect To feare what they create they will neglect. Such charmes her Love will to my armes dispence, Noe forces can withstand their influence. Each leading Rebbell who does now contend Is Altemera's Kinsman or her freind. They fear'd I'd force those Joyes she did deny, Which only made them to Rebellion fly. That beautie for my Queene I'le therefore wooe; Soe end my troubles and my Kingdomes too. All thy disswasions will but fruitlesse prove. I sooner will forsake my Life than Love. Ges. What you designe, I doubt, is likelyest farre To Create Forreigne than end Civill Warre. But what I sayd, my duty made me say. Now you are fix'd, 'tis duty to obey. King. Spoke like a faithfull servant. Come! letts goe, And on this noble Change her pleasure knowe. I cannot thinke I shall Successelesse prove, Presenting her a Crowne and virtuous Love. [Exeunt. [Scene II. A Street in Mora.] Enter Monasin, and Cratoner disguised. Mon. Now wee'r alone, tell mee this charming news, Which will such Joy in all our hearts infuse. Crat. Neere the Black Tower, as I disguis'd did stand, The officer who did the Guards Command Ask'd mee what bussinesse had brought mee there. As soone as ever I his voice did heare, I knew him well to be brave Olerand, Who had soe long serv'd under my Command. Mon. That Olerand who did such noble things That battle where wee lost the best of Kings, Whose Vallour Clorimun soe much did prize, Hee gave him one of the old Companies? Crat. The very same. Mon. How durst they trust him there? Crat. That did to mee a Miracle appeare. But knowing how our Generall hee had Lov'd, And still how true to honour hee had prov'd, I forthwith did acquaint him who I was. Then hee a hundred times did mee embrace, And freely afterwards to mee confess'd Hee lately bought that Office hee possess't. I told him, then, by noe means 'twould be thought A crime in him to sell what hee had bought; To which soe many motives I sett downe, He privately brought mee to Clorimun, Where Olerand protested before mee Hee wou'd this night sett him at Libertie. The Generall too vow'd hee'd noe more deferre By open force to Restore Melizer, Which hee noe longer cou'd esteeme unjust, Th'usurper having freed him of his trust. Mon. Blest be thy tongue which such good news dost bring! Now wee shall change our Tyrant for our King. Crat. Our happie fortune yet does higher fly. The Generall sent both Olerand and I To our true King to let him understand What for his Restauration was in hand, Whose Royall goodnesse has forgiven us all, And has made Clorimun our Generall. And, in a word, thus wee resolv'd the thing: This very night wee shou'd such Forces bring, As when hee shou'd him from the Prison gett, Might to the Campe justifie his retreate. Mon. Since in a Tyrants cause wee prosper'd soe, In the true Kings our Swords shou'd Wonders doe. On the wrong side wee know how wee can fight. Let's prove now wee can doe it on the right. Some joyfull news I can returne to you, For Thrasolin writt to mee, even now, The Campe th'Usurpers crimes soe much resent, That as one man they on revenge are bent. Crat. Thither without delay, then, lett us post, That in this great designe noe time be lost. [Exeunt. [Scene III. A Grove near Leptis.] Enter Candaces alone in a Grove. Cand. Deare Silent Grove, to whome I now have showne That flame which its great causer ne're has knowne, To whose strict secricy I now committ That which to tell myselfe I scarce hold fitt, Betweene my Rivalls I such strife have sowne, They my revenge must act or not their owne. By such darke Arts I now have fixt their hate, They cannot find out truth till 'tis too late, And though in that a high Sinne I committ, I am come here to act a greater yet. Ere Love in mee his Empire did beginne, My spotlesse soule did tremble at a sinne, But now I can with blacker crymes dispence. Custome in sinning takes away the sense. The feare of endlesse flames I am above, Or thinke those flames are lesse than mine of Love. Blind god, what is it which thou makst mee doe? Thou that my sinns does cause, forgive them too. [Shee lies downe. Enter King and Gesippus. King. Never was yet such an aversion seene. To please her hate shee shunns to be a Queene. But since my passion shee does thus deride, Force shall performe what is to Love deny'd. Cand. Â«Gesippus and the King! then I am made.Â» Ges. Being of your Refusall, Sr affraid, Whilst you to her your last resolve made knowne, I won Candaces to come here alone, And have, Sr, soe prepar'd her, that a word Will make her to you her best help afford, Which is soe powerfull you in it may find That ease is needfull to your troubled minde. If you winne her by guifts and promisses, Shee with her Lady can doe what shee please. King. I like the advice, and I her faith will prove. I will make use of all may helpe my Love. Lovely Candaces, you with mee must goe, And helpe at once your King, and Mistrisse too. [Exeunt. [Scene IV. A Street in Mora.] Enter Lucidor alone. Luc. Fortune in crossing mee does take delight. Wee dare be Rebells, and yet dare not fight; A fitter time our Wishes cou'd not grant. The Tyrants camp their Generall does want, Which has incens'd them too to such a height They rather against him than us wou'd fight. Never such causes yet did armies part; The Usurpers wants a head and our's a heart. The tyrants Lust and power soe boundlesse are, Hee'l act what I till now oppos'd by Warre. I'le therefore goe to Leptis in disguise. I cannot Live banish'd from her bright Eyes. Her Guards I will corrupt, or else deceave. Nothing to serve her unassay'd I'le leave. If hee use force, and all my arts shou'd misse, I'le sacrifice my Life to cutt off his. [Exit. [Scene V. A Grove near Leptis.] Enter King and Gesippus. King. Thy councell, freind, mett with the wish'd event. Candaces is become my Confident, And shee advises as my only course That I will threaten to make use of force. My flame and her disdaine such torments prove, That I must loose my life or quench my Love. This truth I sent her by Candaces now, And, as I made, soe will I act my vow. Ges. If you by force pursue what you have sedd, You must resolve to take the Generalls head. It were unwise, treating her at this rate, To let him live, that wrong to vindicate. King. Yes, hee shall dye; that promise I let fall Her teares did force, and 'twas Conditionall. Since shee her mercy does to mee decline, It is but Just I shou'd deny him mine. My Guards forthwith about her Lodgings send; Take from her all things which her life may end. I know not what dispaire may make her doe; Shee who does slight a Crowne, may slight Life too. [Exeunt. [Scene VI. A Chamber in the King's Palace.] Enter Altemera and Candaces. Cand. Your Coldnesse did his fury soe provoke, That hee has sworne much more than I have spoke. Hee will forthwith deflower your chastitie, His lookes more than his oathes assure it mee. Dispaire and Lust are flameing in his Eyes: Honour and virtue hee does but despise. His guards hee sends about your Lodging now. This is your case; resolve what you will doe. Alt. Yee Gods who shoud protect the Innocent, Why are these Plagues to Altemera sent? Men will beleive it (if this you let him doe) My virtue, not my sinns, you punnish now. Think you I may not yet, disguised, fly? Cand. All hope of flight their vigilence deny. There's but one way to which you now can trust: When hee comes here burning with rage and lust, By a bold stroke your Just revenge beginne. Make him the Sacrifice, that is the sinne. Alt. It ne'ere shall be of Altemera said, Virtue to save, shee went to sinne for aid. What you propose, to free mee from distresse, Is by a greater ill to shunne the lesse. Cand. Your honour, then, you give upp to his will. Alt. Noe, my Candaces, I'le preserve it still. If, while I am Innocent, the Gods designe To act my ruine, that's their fault, not mine; And such I alwayes shall to them appeare, If I my flame above my life preferre. Cand. Virtue to save, sinns helpe you will not owne; Doe you then thinke to kill your selfe is none? Alt. When I am forc'd of two ills one to choose, 'Tis virtue then the greatest to refuse. When in this streight I by the Gods am plac'd, I'le rather cease to Live than live unchast. I'le save my honour, though at that deare price. Your helpe I now desire, not your advice. For when I had refus'd to be his wife, Hee forc'd from mee all might destroy my life. Some armes, or Poison now procure for mee To end my dayes and save my chastitie. Cand. Thinke, Madame, on the horrors of the Grave. Alt. I'le only thinke my Honour how to save. Cand. I can for you with Joy my owne life loose, But to advance your death, I must refuse. Alt. If saveing chastitie you doe not Prize, Refuse not yet bow'd knees and weeping Eyes. [Kneeles. By my worst foes I shou'd be better us'd; I am not wont to begg or be refus'd. Cand. This is to mee than death a greater ill, To see my mistresse thus to weepe and kneel. I will obey, though with a bleeding heart, But from you in the grave I will not part. Alt. May you in life, deare freind, still happie prove, And as much blest as I am curst in Love. Cand. When you have acted what you have design'd, What bussinesse then have I to stay behinde? No, Madame, such Commands I must decline. You in your wayes are fixt, and I in myne. But, Madame, since you are resolv'd to die, And what you'l doe must be done speedily; Since the Guards search all who goe in or out, Weapons they'l find, and, why I bring them, doubt; Poyson I therefore thinke the fittest thing, Which unsuspected I to you may bring. Alt. That which you now propose I approve most. In doing of it let noe time be lost, And whilst you bring what must my Life destroy, I'le fitt my selfe to welcome death with Joy. [Exit. Cand. Now my designes, I thinke, are soe well laid, That they by fortune cannot be betray'd, But if to prosper them the Gods refuse, Together with my hopes, my life I'le loose. Who waits there? Enter Confident. Your old disguise put on, And then to Lucidor you must be gone. Tell him this night the King is fully bent To act his hopes by force or by consent. His courtshippe hithertoo has fruitlesse been, Though hee has offer'd her to be his Queene, But shee her constancy soe much does prize, That to preserve it shee does death dispise. Therefore hee must, without the least delay, By art, or force, this night take her away, Else I to him this sad account must yeild, That shee is ruin'd, or her selfe has kill'd. All that I say, alasse! is but too true. [Exit. Conf. What you command mee I with speed will doe. [Exit. Enter Altemera alone. Alt. Death is a debt wc h I to nature owe; Honour and Love calls mee to pay it now. Those who by virtue all their actions steere, Either of those above their life preferre. The shortnesse of my life I cannot blame; Death is repair'd by dying with such fame. Yet some a life after this life distrust, And thinke that death makes Us perpetuall dust. That shou'd not, were it true, my death retard; Virtue shines most, when 'tis without reward. 'Tis only those who here indulge to sence, To Joyes of endlesse life have noe pretence. Eternall death, when this life does expire, Is not the Wickeds faith, but their desire. Enter Candaces with a Violl in her hand. Cand. Madame, I hope in this you'l understand I will obey whatever you Command. The Guards did search mee, ere they lett mee passe, But ne'ere suspected what was in this Glasse; But now that I have brought it, I must say I wish the Guards had taken it away, For still the neerer that you are to dye, The more to it is my Reluctancy. Alt. The neerer I my honours dangers see, Death is soe much the welcommer to mee. If you deny mee that which you have brought, Your sinn will be worse than the Tyrants thought. He makes mee but the feare of ill endure, But it is you deny that ill a cure. Oh, my Candaces, 'twere the highest spight To make mee perish in my harbours sight. Cand. Perhaps all are but threatnings which hee swore. Alt. What would become of mee should they be more? To lose life certainly is much more fitt Than hazard chastitie by saving itt. Show mee the truth of what you have profess'd In not denying mee my last request. Cand. Your teares and prayers who is it can withstand? Thus, Madame, I obey your sad Command. [Kneeles and gives her a Glasse. Alt. With Joy this happie present I receive; By giving this, much more than life you give. [Offers to drinke; Candaces stopps her. Cand. Oh! Madame, thinke what you'r about to doe! Alt. I have well thought on't and resolv'd it too. Feare, I perceive, in thee is much more high To see my death than 'tis in mee to die. My wish'd for remedy may come too late, If wee shou'd spend more time in this debate. I feare not now the Tyrants art nor pow'r. This will evince my truth to Lucidor. Tell him you did his Altemera see Undauntedly drinke immortallitie. [Drinkes of the Poison. 'Tis done, and now the thing is past recall. This poison is become my Cordiall. Thy killing sorrow, my deere freind, decline; Add not to my owne greifes the weight of thine. Cand. Oh, Madame, 'tis but Just you shou'd consent. I mourne that Losse my prayers cou'd not prevent. Alt. Since you want power your sorrowes to reclayme, And to behold them but augments my paine, I will retire into another roome. There tell mee when the tyrant here does come, Where I resolve to meet him and declare How vast my wrongs and his Injustice are. Perhapps my dying words may wound his Eare; Who feares not death needs nothing else dispaire. Cand. What fatall Orders still on mee you lay! But yet what you Command I must obey. [Exeunt at severall doores. Enter King. King. Conscience, the sinne thou fearst is not soe great As are the Joyes attend the acting it. Those very godds, which awe thee soe, have done That which thy fearefullnesse wou'd make mee shunne. Love is by all the Gods their God allow'd, For to his pow'r they every one have bow'd, And yet their hearts ne're felt a sacrifice To Charme like those in Altemera's Eyes, Nor ever yet soe feirce a flame have felt, As that which rather triumph'd here than dwelt. Enter Altemera and Candaces. Â«Ha! Altemera comes to meet mee now. Her feare at length her Constancy does bow.Â» Madame, I hope you come with an intent To lett mee see your Coldnesse you repent. Alt. Noe, Sir, I now am come in hope to Winne Your soule to see, and then abhorr your sinne. That power which by the Gods to you is sent Is to protect, not wrong, the Innocent. The greater is the place that you are in, Abuseing it, the greater is your sin. You thinke but mee you wrong in what you doe, But who wrongs virtue does wrong heaven too. Therefore, great Sir, your fatall sinn decline. I aske it more for your owne sake than mine. King. Of granting such a suite you must dispaire. Your beautie is more powerfull than your Prayer, And my neglected flame is rais'd too high To be supprest with dull morallitie. My virtuous Love to slight is worse in you Than what thereby you now constraine mee too. Alt. How can that, Sir, a virtuous passion bee, Which wou'd pervert, or punnish Constancy? If, Sir, to favour mine you thinke not fitt, At least you shou'd forbeare to Injure it. King. Who to a Kings Just Love shows noe remorse At once provokes and Justifies his force. Alt. Love from fruition all Joyes does divorce, Fruition being made th'effect of force. King. Make it the effect of inclination then, And thereby make mee the most blest of men. Alt. Oh, Sir, I can be none but Lucidors. King. I am to my ways fixt as you to your's. There is noe meanes then left for your escape; You must give Love or else endure a rape. Alt. I knowe not one way to inconstancy, But I knowe many wayes, Sr, how to die. King. All wayes of dying I from thee did take. Alt. Looke in my face and then see your mistake, See how the Collour in my Cheeks decline, And to deaths palenesse does the place resigne. Daggers and Swords you wrested from my hand, But, having Poison left at my Command, That Remedy your Lust did make mee Choose, And now the Welcome vennom does diffuse. [Goes to bed. King. Forbid it, heaven, that beauties soe sublime Shou'd be destroy'd, and only by my cryme. Yet I perceive a palenesse in her Lipps, And her triumphant Eyes are in an Ecclipse. The bright Virmillion from her Cheekes is fledd, And death beginns to reigne where beauty did. What fury was't cou'd your resentment move In this dire way to disappoint my Love. Alt. Since life or virtue I was forc'd to loose, It had been sinn to doubt which I shou'd choose. King. I knowe not which is most, my cryme or Greife. Cand. I'le raise the Court in hope of some releife. [Exit. King. Oh, Altemera, if I cou'd have thought My threatnings cou'd this dire effect have wrought, Rather than have lett out that sinnfull breath, I wou'd have stop'd it by my instant death. Alt. You may deplore but not recall my fate; Your sorrow, though 'twere true, yet comes too late. King. Though 'twere true! Am I soe black with Sinne That my Repentance noe releife can winne? Oh! wou'd to heaven you had been but as slow My crymes to creditt once as sorrow now! Enter Gesippus at one doore; Melizer, Thrasolin, Cratoner, Monasin, and Olerand at the other doore, disguised. Alt. The truth of your repentance will appeare, If you restore the crowne to Melizer. Your Sorrow for your Sinns none can suspect, If you their cause decline and mourne th'effect. King. Oh! wou'd to Heav'n I cou'd your life redeeme By laying at your feet my Diadem! To save you, I with Joy wou'd make it knowne I wou'd my life resigne, as well as Crowne. Alt. My life is past recovery, you see, But doe as much for Justice as for mee. If ever you immortall Joys wou'd winn, You must repaire as well as mourne your sinne, Which that you may, I of the Gods implore. Deaths hasty summons letts mee say noe more. Witnesse, oh witnesse, yee alseeing powers, That as I Live'd, soe I die, Lucidors! [Dyes. King. Oh stay, oh stay a while, faire Maid, thy flight! More of such prayers wou'd once more make mee white. But 'twill not be, for death, like envious night, Drawes his black curtaines o're those Globes of light. Great Gods! already shee is turn'd to bee As cold herselfe, as still shee was to mee. Those cheekes, in which but even now did grow The freshest rose, and the whitest snowe, Have nothing left to entertaine the sence, But the pale Emblem of her Innocence. [Drawes his sword. I will noe more thus trifle out my breath, But right her wrongs by acting my owne death. Faire Injur'd spirit, if thou dost grace With thy bright Lustre this unhallow'd place, Behold, behold, ere my last flight beginns, How in my bloud I wash away my sinns! [Offerrs to kill himselfe and is stop'd by Melizer who takes off his disguise. Who dares soe rudely thus my Justice stay? Mel. Thy deaths a debt my hand alone must pay. Had I allow'd what now thou wouldst have done, Thou hadst usurp'd my vengeance, as my crowne. King. Ha! Melizer, in freedome, and arm'd too! To whome this double favour dost thou owe? Officers discover themselves. Thras. 'Tis wee this double debt our King have paid. The Armie Joynes in it. King. Then I'me betraid! But though, when that bright Maid I did destroy, I meant my sword against my selfe t'imploy, Yet now I thus turne it against you all. Though your false Army to your helpe you call, Yett here I'le stand, and till you have hew'd me downe, My death shall show I merited a Crowne. Mel. If a bold death Life's crymes could wash off soe, What is it then brave Villaines wou'd not doe? Retire awhile in the next roome, for I Must speake with him alone before hee dye. Thras. Let us disarme him, Sr, before wee goe. King. How durst thou entertaine a thought soe lowe? This sword, which once a Kingdome did Command, Nothing but death can wrest out of my hand! Who by the sword an Empire does subdue, Parting with it, must part with his life too. Mel. Retire, I say. His Guilty sword I slight. A tyrant never a true King cou'd fight, Nor is he fitt a Kingdome to Command, Who feares a sword in any single hand. [Exeunt Officers and take Gesippus with them. King. What dost thou meane by this? Mel. I take this way That what I owe to both, I both may pay, For hee that once a Monnarch's crowne did weare Should not die by an Executioner, And hee who on my Throne did dare to stand Ought to receive his death from my owne hand. King. I thought thee moulded of such Common earth, That thou hadst nothing Royal but thy birth. Mel. Thy actions told mee what thy words have said, Else thou wou'dst ne'er have dar'd my throne t'invade, A Throne on which thou such disgrace didst lay, That 'tis thy blood must wash thy sinns away. King. This Hightned gallantry which thou dost show Wounds mee much deeper than thy sword can doe, And makes mee more to greive that I withstood Thy virtuous title than thy right of bloud. Mel. It is but Justice, then, that thou shou'dst die To expiate that double Injury. [They fight and the Usurper falls. King. Oh, if I had not guiltie been to her, Thou never could have been my conquerour. That sinne which against her I did designe, At once, bore upp thy hand, and wigh'd downe myne. Looseing my fame, my crowne, and Mistrisse too, Death is the only Blessing I shou'd woo. Oh treacherous fate, wc h makes mee after all My conquests, by a single hand to fall. [Dies. Mel. Dye both forgiven and forgotten too. Enter all the Officers with Gesippus. Thras. 'Twas to your hand this Justice, Sr, was due. A true Kings virtue did disspence such light, That 'twas too glittering for a tyrants sight. Mel. Let that Gesippus to the tower be ledd. 'Tis to the Law I leave his guilty head. Ges. My sinns already have pronounc'd my Doome. Enter Olerand. Oler. Great Sr, from Clorimun I hither come. His Conduct did the cittadell surprize, Help'd by some of the Army in Disguise. The Alarum did draw the tyrants guards from hence. Against the Generall they made brave defence, But his resistlesse sword did all subdue, And he is now marching to waite on you. Mel. Brave Olerand! it is to him and thee I owe my freedome and my victorie. My minde will never bee at any ease Till my returne has paid your services. Thy death, faire maid, does wound mee past releife. See her interr'd with all the pomp of greife. [Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACTUS QUINTUS [Scene I. A Chamber in the King's Palace.] Enter Confident and Lucidors servant. Conf. Is Lucidor arriv'd? Ser. Hee came ev'n now, And in your chamber longs to speake with you, For such strang news hee in the streets did heare, I left him ev'n sinking under feare. Conf. His greifes are Just, though they be ne'er soe high. Tell him I'le waite on him immediatly. [Exit servant. Page, who waits there without? Enter Page. Page. None waites but I. Conf. Candaces now your truth to her will try. Admitt none hither if your life you prize, Except it be Lucidor in disguise; And when hee comes, lett him forthwith be led, Where the great Altemera now lies dead; And when you there have brought him, then be gone, For true greife will endure noe looker on. [Exit Conf. Clorimun knocks. Page. Who knocks there? who soe e're you are, be gone! Clor. 'Tis I that knock. Page. Who are you? Clor. Clorimun. Page. What wou'd you have, Sir? Clor. I desire to see Faire Altemera, but what's that to thee? Page. What is't which in you this desire has bred, For shee has now above two houres been dead? Clor. I knowe it, yet still that desire I keep; I come over her sacred Corps to weepe. I tell thee this but to remove thy feares; I'le only pay a sacrifice of teares. Page. My Dissobedience will your pardon winne, When I have told you I must let none in. Clor. Give mee admittance, or I'le force my way, And punnish thy unmannerly delay. Page. I dare not, for my Life! Clor. Thy Life is more Indainger'd, if thou open'st not the doore! Page. I must resist noe longer, but be sure My Pardon from Candaces you procure. Till that is gott, her face I dare not see. Clor. Open the doore; then Leave that care to mee. [Page opens the doore and goes out. Clorimun goes to Altemera, gazes a while, and speakes. Though shee is dead, her beauties still are great. Thus day a while does last, though the sunn sett; Thus roses, newly pluck't, a while does showe As faire as when they on their Stalkes did grow. Like lightning to the World shee has been showne, As conquering where shee struck, and as soone gone. Shall all those Charmes of body and of minde Which late soe bright in Altemera shin'd, Like other Common things of natures birth, Be now reduc'd perpetually to Earth? Ah! wou'd thy cruell fate I could reclayme By all the tortures of a slighted flame! Could I by those restore thy Life and peace, My torments then wou'd make my happinesse. Enter Lucidor disguis'd. Luc. Â«What horrors doe my faculties envade, Entring this place, which is deaths blackest shade! All that is sadd and dismall here does dwell, And makes mee, though on Earth, endure a Hell.Â» Clor. Â«Who'se this which makes this fatall place his choice? My sense mistakes, or 'tis my Rivalls voice! I'le hide myselfe a while, till hee has showne What his designes are; then I'le act my owne.Â» Luc. There, oh there, bright Altemera lies, And an Eternall night has clos'd her Eyes! Candaces told mee all thy noble story, Which has not more of sadnesse than of Glory. Thy Love to mee so highly thou didst owne, Thy Life was not soe pretious as his throne. That Virtue makes thee now a starr above, And Patterns leaves for chastitie and Love, Which still shall last when Piramids of Pride Are shrunke into such ashes as they hide. Ah! still my sorrowes has shrunke up my Eyes, Accept these teares as my greifs sacrifice. [Kneeles. Enter Candaces in mens Cloathes and her Confident with her. Cand. See, Lucidor kneeles at his mistrisse Feete. Since nor dispare, nor greife has kill'd him yet, I will my selfe my obstacle remove, And take revenge least I should faile in Love. Conf. Act now what thy Revenge shall most inspire, My sword shall second thee to thy desire. [They shutt the Chamber doore. Clor. Â«Ha! Who are those wc h come at such an houre, And with that fury threaten Lucidor? Their odds in number and their strange disguise, With their intent to kill him by surprize, Must for a moment my Just hate suspend, For honour now calls mee to be his freind.Â» Cand. His death, if acted in this point of time, Will make my happinesse transcend my cryme. All other wayes, having successelesse been, Ile try to alter fortune by this Sinne. [Runns at Lucidor; Clorimun interposes himselfe with his sword. Clor. Hold! hold! here's that which will your fury stay. To kill him, you through mee must make your way. Rise! Rivall, Rise! to thy defence make hast, Else of thy life this moment is the last. These there with treachery had shedd thy bloud, Had not I with my sword that Sinne withstood. Luc. That voice is Clorimuns! 'Tis doubtlesse hee. This yet is done like a brave Enemy; But since to fight with mee thou here has Chose, Why cam'st thou not alone, or who are those? Clor. All are thy foes, but, since wee are too stronge, That name shall now but to those two belonge. 'Twere hard with three to have at once to doe, Therefore I thus change it to two and two. [Goes to Lucidors side. Luc. What may this meane? Where will this wonder end? In words hee is my foe, in deeds my freind. Clor. Thy admiration for a while suppresse, My foes are freinds, while they are in distresse. Luc. Those who wou'd kill mee does not knowe mee, sure, For death is now noe punishment, but cure. Cand. The Gods, I find, my ruine have decreed, That two such Rivalls are soe soone agreed. But I'le soe fight that, if I fall, I may By a brave death wash my lifes staines away. [Fight. Candaces falls by Clorimun and Lucidor kills the Confident. Clor. Thy treacherous foes, by my assistance slayne, Guard thee, for thou are now my foe againe. Though Altemera's dead, those wrongs I'le strive To right thou didst mee, when shee was alive. Luc. To use that Life against thee, were not brave, Wc h 'twas thy Gallantry but now to save. Clor. I sav'd thee only from that base surprise To make thee my Revenges sacrifice. Luc. I wonder, Clorimun, how thou canst prove Soe high in Honour, and soe lowe in Love. Clor. I doe not understand what thou hast spoke. Therefore, with this, that riddle I'le unlock. Luc. Such threatnings are a kindnesse, not a fault, For I more feare thy favours than assault, And if on mee you more such wrongs obtrude, My anger will transcend my Gratitude. Clor. To urge thee more, if thou such words dost beare, It does not spring from Gratitude but feare. Luc. Thy helpe at once injurious was and brave. Thou tyd'st my hands, when thou my Life didst save, But this rude Language, which now falls from thee, Cancells all Bonds thy sword has laid on mee. [They fight and Pause; Altemera rises in her bed. Alt. What noise is this? Alasse! cannot I have Exemption from disturbance in the Grave? My Eyes are Charm'd by some deluding Power, Or those are Clorimun and Lucidor. 'Tis they! What madnesse makes you thus Engage? Quench in my bloud the fire of your great rage. [She rises, runns to part them, she is wounded by Clorimun and falls downe between them. Welcome, oh Welcome, death! thy lookes lesse fright, Than to behold such noble Rivalls fight. Clor. This must be Altemera's voice I heare. Luc. 'Tis shee, or else some Angell does appeare. Alt. Alasse! it is your fatall Quarrells have Wak'd mee from death, and rais'd mee from the Grave. Enter Page. Page. What noise is this? Luc. Fly, fly, for helpe with speed. 'Tis Altemera, rais'd from death, does bleed. [Page runns out. The losse of bloud, I feare, her death will prove. Till Arts helpe comes, accept the helpe of Love. [Sitts Altemera in a Chayre. Alt. That fight, in which you both Engag'd, I found Does make my heart bleed faster than my wound. To cure these wounds I solemnly abjure, Till you, by being freinds, my greatest, cure. Clor. Our quarrell wee hereafter will decide. Now lett Us Joyne to stopp this pretious tide. Alt. Touch mee not, Clorimun, you, who designe To spill my best freinds blood, shall not save mine; But for this hurt you'l make a full amends, If, for its sake, you henceforth will be freinds. Clor. Such deep respecte to your Commands I owe, I'le scarcely thinke my Rivall is my foe. Alt. Now your helpe welcome is, since you declare That which does make my life worthy my care; But may I not, to fix your freindshipps, knowe What caus'd that quarrell which engag'd you soe? Clor. His wrongs to mee did my worst anger move, Since they aspers'd my honour and my Love. Luc. Those wrongs thou fancyest I have done to thee, Are lesse than actuall wrongs thou didst to mee. Alt. Alasse! mee thinks in such a way you doe Tell old disgusts that they may kindle new. Therefore to this short question I'le resort: Is what both say, by knowledge or report? Clor. Myne, I Confesse, is by report; yet I Dare say you'l thinke my author would not lye. Luc. And mine too are by Information; Yet my Informer I may build upon. Alt. However, I beleive you better may Creditt what you shall to each other say. Therefore, upon your honours, tell mee now What wrongs you did to one another doe. Clor. Though in his Love soe well he did proceed, Yet I ne'er Injur'd him, in word nor deed. Luc. And I by Altemera's selfe doe sweare, Not to wrong him was still my studied care. Alt. I creditt both, for I ne'er knew you move But in the wayes of honour, as of Love. Therefore I begg of both I may but knowe Who 'twas those tales did tell, incens'd you soe. Clor. In this my deep obedience too shall shine. My author is a Woman. Luc. So is mine. Clor. But, I beseech you, thinke mee not to blame, If, though I tell the Sex, I hide her name. Enter Melizer and the Page behind the hangings. Page. (to Mel.) Â«There you may see, Sr, what you'd not beleive.Â» (to Alt.) The Chyrurgion hasts your danger to releive. Alt. I thanke him, but hee needs not make such hast, For now the Danger I most fear'd is past. [Exit Page. But, Clorimun, 'tis a sinne to be true To her that's false to honour, him, and you. Therefore, as you are true to Love or fame, From mee noe longer keepe this womans name. Clor. I must noe more a dissobedience show. Candaces is the name you long to know. Luc. And, Madame, 'tis the same Candaces too Told mee those wrongs, which I complain'd of now. Alt. Candaces! shee to whom I did impart Without reserve the secretts of my heart! Is't shee, then, who has all those troubles bred? Whither, oh whither is that Monster fledd? Candaces speakes. Cand. Here, Madame, here does that Candaces lie, Asham'd to live, but not afraid to die. My soule, though on her wings, shall stop her flight, Till I have done these Injur'd Rivalls right. Knowe then that I, who for Candaces past, Am the unhappy guilty Altimast. Luc. Did you say Altimast, the only sonne Of him who lately did usurp the Crowne? Cand. Sone to that King, who but this day was slayne, Who, finding many murmur'd of his Reigne, Declar'd that I faire Rosacleer shou'd wedd, And after him shou'd to this crowne succeed. That heart, which shou'd have been her sacrifice, Was burnt before by Altemera's Eyes. Therefore, upon my destin'd wedding day, With this dead Confident I stole away, And, passing for a woman, I did sue To be admitted to attend on you, And still to please you I was soe intent, That I at last became your confident. Then, when I saw soe great esteeme you bore To Clorimun, such love to Lucidor, I sadly found I must at once Contend With one as Lover, and with one as freind. That was not all: my Father Lov'd you too. Clor. In such a desp'rate Case, what cou'd you doe? Cand. 'Twas then that Lucidor his freinds made strong, And, cloking private hate with publique wronge, Tooke Armes, which gain'd soe much your Fathers mind, To give you to that rivall he design'd, Which to prevent, two of your Guards I wonne, Who did betray the Towne to Clorimun; For, though to see you a pris'ner were a curse, Yet to behold you Lucidors was worse. Luc. That Action shows the tyranny of fate, Strange Love to cause the worst effect of hate. Cand. You wast your Anger, Sr, before your time. Love made mee yet Committ a Blacker Cryme, For, knowing Clorimun and you did move In strictest Rules of Honour and of Love, I cunningly to each of you still sent The foulest stories malice could invent, In hopes such bold Revenge you wou'd designe, That, acting yours, I might encompasse mine. Alt. Oh wickednesse above the highest Curse! Cand. Though this seemes bad, yet I have acted worse. When, Madame, you before my Father came, And hee without disguise disclos'd his Flame, I must acknowledge I was soe unjust As to provoke the fury of his Lust, Soe that hee vow'd, incens'd by his dispaire, To act by force what was deny'd to prayer. Then, with feign'd Poison, I did you beguile, Which seemingly did kill you for a while, But, before this, I had, by an Expresse, Acquainted Lucidor with your distresse. But I had things soe order'd, that his speed Should bring him here only to find you dead, And then resolv'd, assisted by this freind, By killing him my greatest feare to end. Alt. Cou'd you then hope, when Lucidor was dead, And dy'd for mee, that ever I wou'd wedd? Cand. I wou'd have told you, when Life came againe, Dispaire, not I, your Lucidor had slayne, But the Just Gods, I find, had not decreed My crymes, though crymes of passion, shou'd succeed. Yet let this truth from you some pitty winne; My Life had more of Love in't than of sinne, My Life, which, since a trouble to your sight, Thus I enlarge the passage of its flight. [Teares the wound wider. Hee that to right your wrongs soe Just does prove, What would hee not have done to winne your Love? My death is come in a most happy time, If for my death you'l pardon mee my cryme, For the best Joy to which I now pretend Is that your hate and I at onceâmayâend. [Dies. Alt. O fatall death, but o more fatall Life! Yet his confession sure will end your strife. Clor. 'Twill end whatever I had fancied ill. But I know, Madame, he's my Rivall still. Luc. And that high Title solemnly I sweare, Whilst that my Life does last, I still will weare. Enter Chyrurgion hastily. Chy. Where does the wounded Altemera lye? I thought my helpe but crept, though I did fly. Clor. Here, here, she lies, and thy too tedious stay Has made her life with her blood ebb away. Luc. If this ambition'd cure thou dost fulfill, The whole world shall be debtor to thy skill. Chy. I hope my skill, wc h yet I will not boast, May serve mee here, where I desire it most. [Rubbs her temples, and she speakes faintly. Alt. By being freinds my sorrowes now decline, Or else by death I vow to finnish mine. Clor. Is it decreed that wee must cease our strife, Or else that you, madame, will end your life? Alt. It is, brave Clorimun, and listen now To what I here irrevocably vow. Though to your Rivall all my Love is bent, Yet to be his I must have your consent, But yet if I of your consent shou'd misse, I ne're must be anothers, since not his; Soe that 'tis in your power to make me prove A martyr both to freindshipp and to Love. Clor. Oh, Altemera! what is it you doe? At once you promise and you threaten too. You give mee power by what you now expresse To ruine all my Rivalls happinesse, But that great Joy must cost a greater Cryme, For I must ruine you to ruine him. Alt. Since 'tis not in my power, as I have showne, To make your blessing, I'le declyne my owne. None to a higher action can pretend Than choose to dye, rather than wrong a freind. Clor. Yet you would have my duty higher fly; 'Tis more to quitt a Mistresse than to die. Chy. Whilst you're contending in this noble strife, Permitt mee to preserve her noble life. [Offers to dresse her; shee puts him off. Alt. Hold, for I'le know, ere you your art apply, Whether 'tis best for mee to Live or die. In vaine you strive that cure now to pursue, Which I must owe to Clorimun, not you. Chy. If shee refuse my helpe, such is her state, Ten minutes hence, I doubt 'twill come too late. Clor. Your scorning death in mee such greifs had bred, I wish'd you rather Lucidors than dead. Why shou'd not I, since Life againe you have, Performe that wc h will keep you from the Grave, And save your life now at as high a Rate As I would lately have redeem'd it at? The tyrant then forc'd you to that sad fate; What was his sinne, why shou'd I immitate? A perfect Lover shou'd much more endure His Mistresse sufferings to prevent, than cure. 'Twere sinne to thinke I much more wou'd not give To make you happie, than but make you Live. Since 'tis decreed by those Eternall pow'rs You must be either death's or Lucidors, Be his then, Madame, for I'le not deny 'Tis fitter that my hopes, than you, shou'd die. Alt. Then with your Leave, if not by your Comand, I'le give my Lucidor, my faith and hand. Clor. Give it him then, and may you never know Such greifes in all your life, as I feel now. Alt. What is, alasse, in these sad words your drift? Let not the way of giving spoile your guift. Your grant you may, my vow I'le ne'er repent. I'le have your likeing therefore as Consent, Or else from death soe farre I am not yet, But I still knowe how back againe to gett. Clor. Why doe you treat mee at this Cruell rate? Your tyranny surpasses that of fate. Fate only made me wretched, but you show, To please you, I must myselfe soe too; Which yet, I'le doe, and now to you present At once my likeing, Madame, and Consent, But never fortune did like power assigne, For I must give what yet was never mine. Alt. What now I say, your wonder will releive. Though I was not yours to keepe, I'me yours to give. [Chirurgeon Dresses her. Clor. To loose you, Altemera, was a wound Which did my reason trouble, not Confound, And now my passion vanishes, I see Love were not Love, unlesse that it were free. Alt. But one grant more, then all my trouble ends: 'Tis that with Lucidor you'll still be freinds. Clor. How can you thinke I'de act at such a Rate, As to give what I Love to what I hate? Only my Love to you made mee his foe. Now that must cease, my hate shall doe soe too. Alt. Then doe noe longer at such distance stand. Clor. To whome you give your heart, I'le give my hand. Luc. My Gratitude I doe not ill expresse By vowing 'tis vast, as my happinesse. Enter Melizer. Mel. Wonder not, Altemera, that you see Your King to this accord will witnesse bee. And, Lucidor, since you to armes did fly But to preserve your mistresse Chastitie, As soone as arte and time your Mistresse cures, By sacred nuptiall Rites shee shall be yours. To Clorimun's consent you shall have mine, For Altemera's of the Royall Line. [Lucidor kneeles. Luc. These mercies, Sr, confound mee, I confesse. The Life you give is the least happinesse. Your gifts I cannot with more Joy receive, Than for your service I my Life will give. Enter Memnor Conducted by Thrasolin, Monasin, Filadin, Cratoner and Olerand. Mem. Your Subjects, Sir, from whose Campe now I came, [Kneeles. Have sent mee to acquaint you in their name Their Joy, that in your Lawfull throne you sitt. To their true sovereigne gladly they submitt. Against the usurpers pow'r they made defence, But they to you are all obedience. You may doe with them, Sir, what you thinke meet; They lay their Lives and fortunes at your feete. Mel. Rise, Memnor, Rise, you that such news have brought Deserve a pardon sure for any fault. My mercies still shall be to those more great, Which to it trust, and for it doe not treat. Past faults I'le never to Remembrance bring, For which the word I give you of your king. Mem. Long live our Melizer, the great and good, As high in mercy as he is in bloud! Mel. Now, Clorimun, I'le speake for your releife That which shall cure, or else divert your greife. The Apulian king on Scicily does fall, And of this Warr I make you Generall. Clor. That high Command, Sr, which to mee you give, I on my knees submissively receive. [Kneeles. Since Altemera I must Court noe more, Glory is now the Mistresse I'le adore. For, haveing courted her, all must Confesse, Any besides to court, were to goe lesse. In my first Love, though I in vaine did strive, Yet in the second I'me resolv'd to thrive. This Resolution does my fate befitt; I'le outbrave fortune, whilst I yeild to it. Lett all the World against my peace agree; I'le make my happinesse depend on mee. Mem. I on my knees begg in this Warr you'l try [Kneeles. Your late forgiven subjects Loyaltie. You shou'd, great Sr, to make our Joyes Compleat, Helpe Us to pay, as to Contract our debt. Mel. I freely grant you that for wc h you pray, And henceforth take that Army into pay. Crat. By this you'l find 'tis the decree of fate The Souldiers trade shou'd ne're be out of date. Fil. Pitty it shou'd, for all men wicked are, And nothing punnishes all men but Warre. Mon. The price yet of that cure may be too great. Clor. Warr begitts Crymes, as Crymes does warr begett. Thras. Nothing to Souldiers can more wish'd for come, Than to have Warrs abroad and peace at home. Mel. Your March to Morrow, Clorimun, beginne. Now let Us lead faire Altemera in; Then let Us all unto the Temple goe, And Pay to Heaven that gratitude wee owe. FINIS.</field>
