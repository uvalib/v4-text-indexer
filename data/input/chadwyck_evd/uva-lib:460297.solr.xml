      <field name="fulltext">RUNNAMEDE, A TRAGEDY.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Utcunque ferent ea facta nepotes, Vincit amor patriae. Virg.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROLOGUE Before the records of renown were kept, Or theatres for dying heroes wept, The race of fame by rival chiefs was run, The world by former Alexanders won; Ages of glory in long order roll'd, New empires rising on the wreck of old; Wonders were wrought by Nature in her prime, Nor was the ancient world a wilderness of time. Yet lost to fame is virtue's orient reign; The patriot lived, the hero died in vain. Dark night descended o'er the human day, And wiped the glory of the world away: Whirl'd round the gulph, the acts of time were tost, Then in the vast abyss for ever lost. Virtue from fame disjoin'd began to plain Her votaries few and unfrequented fane. Her voice ascended to almighty Jove; He sent the muses from the throne above. The bard arose; and full of heavenly fire, With hand immortal touch'd th'immortal lyre; Heroic deeds in strains heroic sung, All earth resounded, all heaven's arches rung: The world applaud what they approved before, Virtue and fame took separate paths no more. Hence to the bard, interpreter of heaven, The chronicle of fame by Jove is given: His eye the volume of the past explores, His hand unfolds the everlasting doors; In Minos' majesty he lifts the head, Judge of the world, and sovereign of the dead; On nations and on Kings in sentence sits, Dooms to perdition, or to heaven admits; Dethrones the tyrant tho' in triumph hurl'd, Calls up the hero from th'eternal world, Surrounds his head with wreaths that ever bloom, And vows the verse that triumphs o'er the tomb. While here the muses warbled from their shrine, Oft have you listened to the voice divine. A nameless youth beheld with noble rage, One subject, still a stranger to the stage; A name that's music to the British ear! A name that's worshipp'd in the British sphere! Fair Liberty; the Goddess of the Isle, Who blesses England with a guardian smile. Britons! a scene of glory draws to night! The fathers of the land arise to sight; The legislators and the chiefs of old, The roll of patriots and the Barons bold, Who greatly girded with the sword and shield, At storied Runnamede's immortal field, Did the Grand Charter of your Freedom draw, And found the base of Liberty on Law. Our author, trembling for his Virgin Muse, Hopes in the favourite theme a fond excuse. If while the tale the theatre commands, Your hearts applaud him, he'll acquit your hands, Proud on his country's cause to build his name, And add the Patriot's to the Poet's fame.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS in the DRAMA. KING JOHN. AMBASSADOR. LANGTON Archbishop of Canterbury. ALBEMARLE, with Norman Lords. ARDEN, with the Saxon Lords. ELVINE. EDGAR. FRENCH AMBASSADOR. ELVINA. EMMA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. The Hall of a Baron's Castle. Martial Music. Enter, at opposite Doors, Albemarle with Norman Lords, and Arden with the Saxon, Archbishop, Barons, Knights, and Squires in complete Armour, and with the Train of chivalry. Archbishop. Barons of England's realm, high Lords of parliament, Hereditary guardians of the kingdom! Your country calls you to her last defence. Our antient laws, our liberties, our lives May in a moment fall. Red o'er our heads The ruthless tyrant holds oppression's rod, Which, if not warded, by heroic hands, Will crush the British liberties for ever. Ourselves, our children, our posterity Are slaves or free from this decisive hour. For now the crisis of our fate is come, And England's in the scale. Albemarle. I boast no more The fire and spirit of my youthful days; Days when, with Richard in the grand croisade, We raised the siege of Ascalon; displayed The British banners in the Holy Land, Drove from the field the millions of the East, Compell'd the mighty Saladine to fly, And o'er the crescent raised the glorious cross. My arm refuses now to draw the sword; But let my counsel weigh: Our quarrel's dropt, Let factions now unite; with one accord Let us deliberate for public good; We stand united, or divided fall. Arden. Deliberation does not suit the time; This is the hour of action and of war. While we consult, the tyrant, on his march, Comes like a conflagration thro' the land, Marking his way with ruin. Every step Treads on the mangled bodies of the dying. The wail of England weeping o'er her sons, The voice of Justice, and the cry of blood, Call loud “To arms, to arms!” Baron. The voice we hear: It sounds not to the deaf. You gallant host Return this answer which we now return. [Drawing their swords and coming forward. Archbishop. I love your zeal: It is a flame from heaven; 'Tis the high temper of the Briton bold. And while this ardour in your bosom burns You never will be slaves. At such a time When order's fled, when government dissolves, When the great course of justice thwarted stops, And in the roar and riot of misrule The voice of Law is silent, Nature then Resumes her antient rights, ascends anew A sovereign on her throne; recalls the sword Which with the scepter to the King she gave, And whirls it flaming in her own right hand, To dash the tyrant from his blood-stained car, And guard her free-born sons. Arden. The glorious sons Of Gothic sires who broke the Roman arm Stretch'd out to wield the sceptre of the world, Who on the ruins of imperial Rome, And in the blood of nations and of Kings The firm foundation of their freedom laid, Will never bend beneath a tyrant's yoke. Rather than wear dishonourable chains, Or follow captives at the trophied car, Give us again the wildness of our woods, And the fierce freedom of our great forefathers! Archbishop. Forbid it Heaven, that Britain see anew What these sad eyes have seen! When o'er the land, The dire devoted land, the curse of Rome Flew like the thunder of avenging Heaven, And smote the people. Then religion fled. No bell did summon to the house of prayer; No vested priest attoned the wrath of heaven; But sitting solitary, wept, and wailed His fane forsaken and his altar low. Un-named, unsprinkled in the fount of life, The infant raised the lamentable shriek. The bridegroom and the bride bewailed apart Their rites unfinished and their luckless love. Against the dying saint heaven's gate was shut. They sung no requiem to the parting soul, Nor laid the ashes in the hallowed ground; Earth seem'd a charnel-house, and men like ghosts Who cross in silence at the midnight hour, And beckon with the hand. Arden. Yes, Barons, Britons, The history of the tyrant's reign has run A period marked with the tears, the groans, The blood of Britons. He began in blood His direful reign, and with unnatural hand Stabb'd his own nephew kneeling at his feet, And pleading for his life. Have you not seen him The mighty hunter of the human prey In a waste forest? Has not England seen The cradle of her infants stained with blood; The bower of chastity, the bed of love Assaulted, violated? Lo! you stand Upon the recent tomb of parents slain! Had such dire bloodshed curs'd the former age, Our valiant fathers would have shook the throne. Albemarle. We are as valiant as your fathers were; Nor does the Norman to the Saxon yield. To curb the tyrant, not to shake the throne, We draw the sword—Arden, remember— Archbishop. Barons, This is no time for quarrel. Have you heard That the perfidious Dauphin— Albemarle. What! Perfidious?— Archbishop. The Dauphin, whom you courted to your aid; He whom your great deliverer you hailed, Means to make you his ministers, to gain A kingdom to himself, and then to take Your heads, as traitors, to your native Prince. Melun, entrusted with the bloody secret, In his last hour revealed it. Arden. God of heaven!— Archbishop. I mark your wonder: Hear what I advise. Too long the land hath suffered, and hath bled, With deadly strife, with battles fiercely fought Between the Saxon and the Norman race. By feud and faction all the land is torn; The nation's genius acts against itself. Shook from its central poise, reels all the isle. The noble Romans, when the foe approached, Forgot their strife; and, holding out the hand, With girt Patrician, girt Plebeian march'd, The common sons of Rome: But, fierce and fell, While the conspiring nations hem you round, You wage with one another horrid war. The vaunting foe rejoices in your strife, And lists you agents to your own destruction. Proof against foreign power, the nation stands: By Britons only Britain e'er can fall. Sound in itself, this island is the world. Albemarle. With dire intestine ills the nation groans, And would to Heaven the remedy were found! Arden. So every lover of his country prays. Archbishop. Then hear the oracle of heavenly truth! You both are brave; both thro' the world renown'd; And now the time demands an Union firm, Never to be dissolved. The past forgot, And ever blotted from the book of fame, In cordial concord let the future run. Your wisdom will suggest some solemn rite, Or public deed, to ratify th'event, A bond of union, and a pledge of peace, For ages to remain.—You, Albemarle, Are happy in a daughter fair, the boast And beauty of the isle: On whom can you So well bestow her hand, as on the man To whom the bravest of our warriours bow? Your rival houses will be reconciled, And one the Norman and the Saxon prove. Albemarle. There is a bar which cannot be removed. Elvine, the gallant lover of her youth, Returning, laurel'd, from the holy war, Reigns in her heart. Baron. He's in the Dauphin's camp, And fights the battles of perfidious France Against his native land. Another Baron. The brave Lorraine, His chosen friend in distant Palestine, Whose beauteous sister is the flower of France, Has won that hero to the Dauphin's side. Albemarle. Tho' William's royal blood flow in his veins, And he ranks nearest to the Norman line, Yet to my country I devote myself, Devote my all. Give me thy hand, my son, I know that thou art brave. [Saxons and Normans meet with one another, and embrace. Archbishop. Illustrious chiefs, I praise your wisdom, equal to your zeal. Propitious Providence! I hail the day That makes one nation of the British race. Now quarrels cease, and faction is no more. For freedom, and the laws, we draw the sword, And lose the private in the public cause. One effort more remains: So great an host Requires a General to lead them forth. This day determines that important choice. [To Arden.] To you two nations, now in union joined, Look up, and hail their leader and their chief. [Barons express their consent. Arden. Barons, the soldier of your choice will strive To prove him equal to supreme command, And worthy of your trust. When I behold The warlike spirit spread from man to man, And wide the flame of liberty extend, I hear, with joy, the trumpet's sound, which calls The host to freedom, and the chiefs to fame. Archbishop. Then to the holy altar let us march, And in the fane, which future times will reverence, Renew our league, and seal our sacred bond. [Gates of the chapel open. Procession to the altar. Barons kneel around. Archbishop administering the oath. Now, at the Altar, in the name of Heaven, And in the presence of th'Eternal Power, You ratify your bond of peace! You swear To march the champions of your native land, Never to sheathe the sword, till you restore The antient rights and liberties of England; And, while you bind a tyrant by the laws, To guard the glory of the British crown! Barons. This, in the presence of High Heaven, we swear! SCENE II. Trumpets, French Ambassador, Barons. Ambassador. The Dauphin, anxious for his noble friends, And eager for the hour that shall restore To rescued England liberty and law, Entreats you, Lords, to name the fittest time To join our forces for the future fight. Arden. Our forces never shall with his be joined; Nor English freedom e'er depend on France. Ambassador. What means my gracious Lord? Arden. My meaning's plain. We have detected his designs. We know him. Go tell your master—instant to depart, And waft his army to the coast of France. Tell him, that Britain never will become The province of a foreign kingdom. Tell him, That when he wields the thunder, and gives law To the wild ocean, and the wind of heaven; Then let him think on Britain. Ambassador to Albemarle. Noble Lord, The illustrious Dauphin, and the heir of France, Entrusts a message to your private ear. Albemarle. I have no secret with him. Speak it out. Ambassador. I best can speak it to yourself alone. Albemarle. Speak it to all the world. Ambassador. Illustrious Lord, On you the Dauphin's happiness depends. Albemarle. On me!— Ambassador. You have a daughter . . . fair Elvina— The crown of France may sit upon her head. Albemarle. My daughter's to that noble Lord betrothed. Arden. to the Ambassador. You may withdraw. SCENE III. Barons, Archbishop. Arden. Barons, we now are one; We are invincible. An host like ours, A league of patriots, and a band of friends, Will front the world. We need no foreign aid. Britain's almighty in the cause of Britain. SCENE IV. Albemarle, Arden. Albemarle. By my command my daughter hither comes. Arden, the affection of a friend I've shewn; Now let the counsel of a parent weigh. Valiant thou art; invincible in war; But that avails not now. The accent stern, The fierce demeanour, and the lofty look, Will not invite th'affection of the fair. Now let the warriour to the lover yield; Put on the gay caparison of courtship; Caress and conquer. Women, to be won, Must first be woo'd. Engage the tender sex By tender cares, and merit love by loving. When softened to a smile, the brave and bold Assume the accents, and the looks of love, They win at once the heart of womankind. Arden. I do not know these arts. The pliant face, The honey'd accent, and the silken smile, The sport of boys and girls, are not for me. The manners of my fathers I retain, The Saxon spirit, and the Saxon garb. They did not bow the knee to womankind, Nor at the gate of beauty beg a boon. In antient days, the days of mighty men, Love was the meed of valour and renown; The bravest warriour clasp'd the fairest maid. But what the honour of a Baron owes, And what the daughter of a Baron claims, Shall be perform'd. Behold, the virgin comes. SCENE V. Albemarle, Arden, Elvina. Elvina. You sent for me, my father? Albemarle. Yes, my child. In these heroic but disastrous times All have their part to act: For who would wish To let such great occasion pass away, Nor mark it with renown? Who does not hear The voice of glory when his country calls? A change of times arranges human minds, And noblest spirits find the highest place. Your's, as becomes you, is a brilliant sphere. This hero, chosen to the chief command Of England's patriot host, intreats your hand In noble love; the Barons have agreed, The time requires, and I have pledg'd my word That he shall be your husband. Elvina. Heavens! My husband!— Arden. Let not my honest speech offend thee, Lady. Bred in a camp, my business has been war. The tent has been my home; and oft this hand Has reap'd the harvest of the bloody field. If high respect for your illustrious line, And true affection to a form so fair, Win your approving smile, you send me forth Your champion to the field, at once to gain The palm of beauty and the prize of arms. Elvina. My Lord, my heart yet trembles from the shock Of such a serious unforeseen event, On which my future destiny may turn. Forgive me, if alarm'd, I seek to pour My secret accents in a father's ear. SCENE VI. Albemarle, Elvina. Elvina. Alas! I have no more a father's ear To hear my voice; no more a parent's breast That yearns with pity for his daughter's woes! And will you give me to the deadly foe Of all your house, and wed me to despair? Albemarle. Be calm, my child. He is no more a foe. Think of the noble and the patriot ends Of such an union: Antient feuds will cease; Our rival houses will be reconciled, And, from the Normans and the Saxons joined, One mighty nation will go conquering forth; And the whole land will raise a grateful eye To thee, the cause of all. Elvina. To quell the feuds, And reconcile the families of foes, Am I the sacrifice? Alas! my Father, And will you offer up, with your own hands, Your child a victim?—What have I to do With states or nations?—I've a single heart, And it is Elvine's.—Dost thou then forsake Thine ancient friend?— Albemarle. He hath forsaken us. Now in the Dauphin's camp he draws the sword Against his native country; if thou hast The sense of honour glowing in thy frame, Thy country's spirit, or thy father's blood, Thou too wilt cast him off.— Elvina. I cast him off— I cast off Elvine!—O, thou knowest him not! Albemarle. I know him false. A traitor to his country Will ne'er to friendship or to love be true. Elvina. He is no traitor. He hath been belied. Soaring above the sphere of common men, They aim the secret and the venom'd shafts To bring that eagle from his sky of fame. Ah! once he was beloved!— Albemarle. My child, no more Think of that passion as a toy of youth, And with the geugaws of thy early days Be it dismiss'd. Think of thy duty now. Respect thy Father, and regard thyself. Elvina. I need not try to alter your resolves! Which now seem firm, inflexible, and arm'd Against your daughter: Let me just recall That, in your eye, and with your kind consent, I loved my hero with the love of youth. 'Twas you that kindled first the tender sparks Of an eternal flame. Blooming you brought, In infant beauty, to Aldarno's vale, The noble orphan of the Norman race, The lovely sun-beam of a setting line. When hand in hand we sported in your hall, You fondly marked with paternal smiles The young Elvina for young Elvine's bride. Albemarle. My child, you trespass on a parent's love To name the trifles of your early days. Elvina. Let me, at least, repeat your gracious words! Would, too, I could recall the tender looks With which you spoke them. Sometimes you have design'd To bless Elvina with a fonder glance. —My mother too: And her you will not blame, For I have seen you weep upon her grave; And now she shines above a saint in heaven! My mother, sitting on that ghastly bed From which she never rose; call'd us around; Held us embraced with cold and dying hands; Then lifted up her closing eyes to heaven— “O God! to thee, to thee I leave my children.” She spoke no more.—One parting kiss she gave; Then join'd our hands, and died. . . I see you weep— I see the father melting in your eye, [Falling at his feet. I am yet your child—O! if you ever loved me! Oh! if my life be precious in thy sight; If e'er my woes did wet a father's cheek! If e'er my shrieks did pierce a parent's ear!— O! if the future fortune of my life, My peace on earth, or happiness in heaven, Can aught avail to win me to thy heart, O! save me, save me from the worst of woes, Save me, my father!— Albemarle. Rise my lovely child! Come to thy mansion in a parent's heart! But ha!—Alas!—what can thy father do? I've sworn that you shall be the wife of Arden! Elvina. Sworn? . . . . Albemarle. At the altar. Elvina. Sworn that I be Arden's? . . . . Albemarle. Hear me, Elvina: Hear a parent speak. Till now you've ever been a duteous daughter, And often made this aged heart o'erflow With secret gladness: In the lonely hour, I've lifted up my hands, and blest the day When thou wert born. Not often have I blamed thee, Or used the harsh tone of authority. It is not so that we have lived, Elvina! But here the Baron issues his command. If, when this storm of war is pass'd away, You do not wed the leader of our host, You are no child of mine: I cast you off. You hear my fix'd, irrevocable word. Elvina. If I am doom'd to wretchedness and wo, And doom'd by you!—your will shall be obey'd. SCENE VII. Elvina, Emma. Elvina. Oh! Emma! I am wretched. Arden. . . Heavens! Shall Arden be my husband? Gracious powers! Forbid that hour!—Now in my deep distress, Ah! where is he who used to bring relief? 'Tis well, by heaven!—he's in the Dauphin's camp. Invite th'Ambassador.— [Writes a letter in great agitation, tears it, and writes again. Emma returns with the Ambassador. Elvina. Say, is not Elvine in the Dauphin's camp? Ambassador. Lady, the camp is honour'd with his presence. Elvina. May an unfortunate and friendless maid Intreat the favour of a gallant knight To give these letters to his secret hand? Ambassador. Lady, by beauty and by birth renown'd, His hand shall hold them ere the day decline. Elvina [giving him the letter. Forlorn, forsaken, to your care I trust My future fate, the secret of my soul. Howe'er by faction or by feuds disjoin'd, No deadly hate in man to woman dwells; The knight is courteous to the hapless maid. SCENE VIII. Ambassador alone, looking at the Letter. No superscription here. Her troubled mind Forgot to add the name. Ha! Yes, by heaven!— It dawns, the work of fortune and of fate— This to the Dauphin I will straight address, And warn the wishing bridegroom of the secret. A passion slighted, and a rival loved! This is the insult, the fell injury Which man or woman never can forgive. With Albemarle then Arden is at war; The Normans hence and Saxons will divide, And thus divided may be conquered still. Ardent in arms impetuous Britain sights, Refined in arts, France plots and overcomes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. Trumpets. Enter Archbishop and Albemarle at one Door, Arden and Barons at the other. Albemarle. What from the camp, my Lord? Arden. The hosts are joined. All friends and fellow soldiers, they compose One mighty army. Rivals now are friends, And brothers of the war. Yon field displays A scene of glory to a soldier's eye. I never saw the face of war so gay, So beauteous. Glancing in the sun, behold The camp in motion, and the field on fire. The soul of freedom animates them all. Impatient for the trumpet's sound, they act The future fight; and, brandishing their arms, With flaming circles sweep the empty air. Archbishop. Bold is the heart for liberty that beats, And strong his arm who draws his country's sword. When for a nation's rights the banner flies, The victor's laurel with the olive twines: The host of freedom is the host of God. [Enter a Messenger with a Letter to Arden. Arden. The news I have received concern us deeply. Barons, we tremble on the verge of fate. In this confederate host a traitor lurks, Who has betray'd our measures to the foe, And holds a correspondence with the Dauphin. Albemarle. A traitor among us! Arden. A secret foe, Who plots our ruin. Guards, arrest th'ambassador: Bring him before us. Now, before we know This great offender, Barons, it is meet That we pronounce his doom, lest he should stand Too near our heart, by friendship or by blood, And so elude the sentence of the laws. Albemarle. Although my nature leads me to be mild, Yet here the highest punishment is due, And timely rigour is humanity. By this our high authority we guard, And strike astonishment and terror round To all offenders in the time to come. No favour or affection will seduce The steady patriot from the public good. He to his country his own life devotes; Nor will he spare a traitor's. Archbishop. Instant death He merits. Rousing at the call of Heaven, Now when the noblest spirits of the world Plan for the public; when the bravest hands Are rais'd to strike for freedom and mankind; When just pronounced in the fane of Heaven, The recent vow yet trembles on the tongue; If meanly lurking, mid' a chosen band Of patriots and of heroes, one be found, False to his trust, his honour, and his oath, Who, scorning sanctions, human and divine, Betrays his country to her foes, divides Th'inheritance of future times, and sells Eternal honour for eternal shame; 'Tis then that justice, reddening into wrath Demands a victim for the public good: A great example will restore the host: A traitor's blood will reinstate the laws. Arden. Does then the general voice pronounce his doom? Barons. One is our voice; and death is the award. Arden. The bonds of friendship, and the ties of blood Cancell'd, then awful justice holds its course. His Country is the parent of the brave, Who march devoted where she points the way. [Noise behind Scenes. Ambassador brought in. Ambassador. This is the insolence of anarchy! Though you have risen against your rightful king, I hope you still regard the law of nations. Why, even in barbarous, and in savage states, Ambassadors are sacred— Arden. When they're honest. But, if they plot against the kingdom's weal, They answer with their life. There is a letter Sent by some traitor to your prince the Dauphin. Produce that letter, and in peace depart. [Ambassador gives it to Arden, who peruses it with marks of agitation. Albemarle. You start! From whom, my Lord?— Arden , [Giving it to him. Inform yourself. Albemarle [Reads the Letter. “To the Dauphin. “A dark design is going on against us; “Why art thou absent in the day of war? “Come on the wings of love to save the fond, “Ah! if you come not, the undone—Elvina.” My daughter! Heavens! It is impossible! Elvina , [entering unseen by Albemarle. What means this tumult? Oh! Eternal powers! I am betray'd! The fatal secret's known— [Apart. Albemarle , [Recovering from his astonishment, reads again. “A dark design is going on against us; “Why art thou absent in the day of war? “Come on the wings of love to save the fond, “Ah! if you come not, the undone—Elvina.” Undone Elvina! Ah! Undone indeed! [Seeing her. Ha! Take her from my sight. Alas! my daughter, Thou wast an angel once!—Ye shades of death Fall round, and wrap me in your gloom forever! Archbishop. Unhappy father! we lament thy woes. The sacred season of the hoary hair Such shocks of destiny can ill sustain. In this dark hour of trouble and despair We look to thee alone. Albemarle. Support me, Heaven, In this tremendous hour, and give me strength For such a trial! Ah! what have I done? All-righteous God, what evil have I done, That, in the fall of life, thy heavy hand In wrath should crush me to the ground, and bring My hoary head with sorrow to the grave! You wonder at me: Tell me how to act; Ye that are fathers, tell me what to do?— Shall my Elvina?—Must my daughter die? Oh! must the parent doom his child to death?— —You answer not. Your silence, and your tears, Point out my path . . . I was a father fond, Fond to distraction of an only child— But I am just; and I have not forgot What to my country and my oath I owe. Nature may cry, but justice shall be heard: Dear, dear as she is to me—she shall die! Archbishop. Hard is thy duty now, heroic father! But high the part appointed thee of Heaven. Resume thy spirit: Call thy virtue forth. Now, in the conscious eye of Heaven and earth, Thou actest for the glory, for the good Of ages yet to come: Thou standest forth. A great example to the wondering world. —I see it plain: Behold the hand of Heaven Stretch'd from the sky, and beckoning thee to tread A high heroic path!—The latter days, The fate of England in succeeding times, The fame and glory of the British isle, Hang on the passing hour. Albemarle , [In astonishment. What means my Lord?— Archbishop. Lo! now 'tis thine, by one immortal deed, To form the character of future times, And raise a spirit that shall never die. See! What a family you will embrace! You rise the founder of a mighty state, The father of the free! The nation takes From you its temper; and the ages rise To call you patriot! Ah! who would not wish A destiny so high? Albemarle. I wish it not. Archbishop. 'Twas thus, when Rome her liberty regained, A father doom'd his darling son to death; He won immortal glory, and inspired Rome with his spirit. From his patriot deed Went sudden virtue living o'er the land. The Roman kindled when he heard the tale, And stepp'd a hero forth; and eager burn'd For Rome to combat, and for Rome to die. Hence heroes, patriots, croud the historic page; Hence consuls, senators, a God-like train! Hence a great people rose, the Lords of earth; Hence many centuries of glory roll'd In long procession; and eternal Rome, The Queen of nations, did ascend the throne, And sway the sceptre of the sea-girt world. Albemarle. Thou hast no daughter.— Arden. In the dreadful shock Of this disaster, Barons, it is meet That to a parent's feelings we appeal, And bid the father of his country judge. [The Barons retire to the bottom of the Theatre. Albemarle , [On the front. Am I the judge? My country, at thy voice, This old gray head shall wear the helm again: Bare in the field these scars shall bleed anew.— O powerful Nature! I'm a father still— Thou bleeding innocence! Ah! should the sword Just aim to touch that tender trembling bosom, 'Tis mine to ward the blow.—Shall I direct The dagger to the bosom of my child, And stop the dearest current of my blood?— But justice, truth, imperious honour, call . . . Forgive me, O my country, if I stain A Roman's virtue with unmanly drops!— 'Tis done. Th'irrevocable doom is sealed. Where am I? Ha! the shades of death surround me, And graves, and monuments, and ghastly forms— That path leads down to blood—Thou fainted shade, Who gav'st a blooming cherub to my arms, O turn thy tender eyes from this sad scene, Nor look upon the deed!—Ah! piteous sight! Stretch'd on the block, the trembling victim's laid; The pale hand waves that should have clos'd my eyes. That was the sign of death!—What do I see?— A heedless trunk; a mangled corpse—Oh! Oh! Barons, the dreadful sacrifice is made: But spare me! spare a father the sad sight— —Yet ah! before I go let me behold her, To take a long last look of my Elvina Before she dies, before we part forever. —I hear her step. The trembler comes. She looks As she were innocent. Her face is woeful, Yet it is lovely; I could look for ever. My daughter—Thou art doom'd—These tears will tell thee— My child! My child! [Looking earnestly upon her as he goes out. Baron. Alas! unhappy man! Thy age is desolate. Ill-fated maid, In prime of youth and beauty doom'd to death! Arden. Now, as the law of chivalry ordains, And honour's cause demands, Barons prepare A place of combat in the listed field; If any Knight or Baron of the land Will stand a champion to defend the fair. SCENE II. Arden, Elvina. Arden. This happy morning, Lady, you appeared The wife of Arden in the eye of England, And tho' our hands were not in wedlock join'd, Our interest is one. I have a right To interpose in your concerns; and more, I feel your sorrows as they were my own, For I lament you more than I can blame. Elvina. I hope my Lord you come not to disturb The dying moments of a wretched maid, And wring a heart that soon shall cease to beat. Arden. I come not to renew, but end your woes. I've a proposal for thy serious ear, On which the fortune of thy life depends. Elvina. My Lord, I listen to it. Arden. You are young, Elvina, you are beautiful; allured And dazzled with false glory, you have erred One step from duty; if reflection soon Recalls you to the path from which you've strayed, You add one beauty to a virtuous life, Which spotless innocence can never boast. If you renounce, if from your heart renounce, Renounce for ever that opprobrious love, Then I this instant to the plain descend, The champion of your cause: A husband's arm Will wipe the stain that rests upon thy name, And upon mine: My honour is at stake: A Baron of the realm, an English chieftain, Arm'd, and invested with supreme command, Will never brook dishonour, never bear The shadow of affront; nor suffer man To point the finger, or to lift the look Of scorn against him. Elvina. In this hour of woe, Your noble generosity, my Lord, Hath given another pang to this sad bosom, Which yet, alas! no just return can make. Inviolable vows oppose your claim; Stronger than vows, unalterable love Reigns in a heart that owns no second Lord. Arden. That is the language of aversion fix'd. Elvina. It is the language of Elvina's soul. Arden. And have I merited thy stedfast scorn? Elvina. I scorn thee not. I can distinguish well A lover's passion from a Baron's pride. The candid bosom opens to the day; Nor clothes ambition in the garb of love. Your virtues I revere; your rank respect; But who can teach a tender heart to throb? I look upon thee as my Father's friend; My country's champion: Never as my knight, Or as my husband. Arden. Then behold your judge. Guards, watch the prisoner. SCENE VI. Elvina alone. Now the dye is cast; And I have sealed the sentence of my death. O thou that helper of the helpless art! O be not absent in the hour of woe! Forsake me not when by the world forsaken! No hope have I on earth: To thee I fly, As to a father's arms: I have no father, No friend, but thee alone. God of my youth! Thou didst receive me with paternal arms When cast an infant on a wretched world; And when a stranger thou didst guide my feet Thro' the wild maze of life: O leave me not, My God, in my last hour!— [Going off with the Guards, Albemarle enters, takes her by the hand, and leads her in silence to the front of the stage. Albemarle. Alas! my daughter, The day of trouble now hath come upon us! I am an old man: I am miserable! And thou art fallen, friendless, and forlorn! Alas, Elvina! Thou hast brought us low! Elvina. I'm every way unhappy and undone. Albemarle. After what pass'd this morning, what you've done So wild, so monstrous seems—it is incredible! Alas! it was the effort of despair. I would not shock thee now—'Twould be an insult— O Heaven! what agony the bosom rends When the curse comes upon the hoary head! Elvina. Oh! I am doubly wretched to involve My father in despair!— Albemarle. O fond old man! O foolish father! I delighted, thought, This tempest o'er, my evening would be bright, And my departure like the setting sun. I fondly thought, when better days return'd, Safe under shadow of the vine to sing, And bless my children's children! fondly thought To see a race of thine around me rise, The young Elvinas of the age to come; Trace my own features in their opening looks, Hear the first accents of their lisping tongues, Woo their embraces, fold them in my arms, And like an old man prattle in their praise. Then looking heaven-ward, to depart in peace, In his good hour: Within their arms and thine, Th'embrace of nature! look my last adieus, And smile, and fall asleep—O God of heaven, Now I am childless!— Elvina. 'Tis too much, my father! I was prepar'd to meet thy stern rebuke; I could have borne the looks and words of wrath. But shield me, Heaven! for I can ne'er support A father's tenderness, a father's tears, That look forlorn that marks the bursting heart. Albemarle. To what is age reserved? I never thought That thou would'st prove a parricide, my daughter, That thou wouldst pluck these white hairs by the root, And dig thy father's grave. I thought not so. [Starting back. What hast thou done?—Yet thou art still my child; Thou art my only child!— [Taking her in his arms. By Arden awed, None of our Barons will defend thy cause: I will defend thee; I will be thy champion. Old is my arm, but, in a cause like this, A daughter's cause, it still can draw the sword. I'm young again— [Drawing his sword. Elvina. A combat so unjust, A spectacle so dire, I must forbid. In this alone I from your voice appeal, Never to yield. O you have ever been The noblest friend, the best, the fondest father! And can you think that I would poorly prove Such an ungrateful and unnatural child As e'er endanger, in the strife of death, Your life for mine one instant? All I ask In my last moments, O forget my fault, The fault of too much love; at last forgive A child—who never can offend you more! When I am silent, as I shall be soon, Let not reproach assail my virgin fame, And heap dishonour on the head laid low. Defend your daughter when she's in the dust. Let not the voice of slander pierce my tomb, To break the peaceful Sabbath of the grave, And call my spirit from the land of rest. I would confer in secret with my maid. Adieu, my father! If we meet no more, Adieu forever! Albemarle , [Embracing her. O my lovely child, Adieu!—Th'Eternal eye alone beholds When we shall meet again— SCENE II. Elvina, Emma. Elvina. My faithful Emma, My dear companion in the days of youth Before distinction of our birth was known, I would depart in peace with all the world. If ever I have treated you with rigour, Or chid you without cause— Emma. O never, never! My noble Lady, you have ever been. The best, the kindest, and the sweetest mistress, And less your servant than your friend I've lived. O would to God that I could die for you! Elvina. I have a last request to make, my Emma, A dying charge to give! Find out that youth For whom in early years I'm doom'd to die; O tell him, charge him, if he ever loved me, To guard, to pity, and solace the age Of my poor father! as another child My place to fill, my duty to perform. Tell that for him I would have wish'd to live: Tell that for him I died: And all I ask, Is for my sake, for his Elvina's sake, To love my father, and remember me! I know his tender heart: I would not wish him To mourn my fate in bitterness of soul, And waste his days in solitude and sorrow. Yet I would have him—sometimes to be sad— To think of her who died for him; to come A midnight mourner to my silent tomb, And wet my ashes with a lover's tears. Then in th'appointed house I'll rest in peace, And wait the morning that awakes the dead.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. Flourish of Trumpets. Enter Elvine, his Squire, bearing his Armour. Attendants. Elvine. Hail native land! O scenes of early days! Ye haunts of friendship, and retreats of love, Receive a stranger to your shades again! You I revisit with a throbbing heart. In youthful days, in your inspiring bowers, Rapt to the world of fancy, I have wish'd For such occasion high; my country's cause, The cause of liberty, the cause of love, And of Elvina! Providence divine Be thine the praise! who hast before me set The deeds that never die; unsheath'd my sword For ages yet to come, and sent the voice Which calls the brave to freedom and to fame. Enter Edgar. Come, Edgar! hast thou found my antient friends? Hast thou beheld?— Edgar. Alas! unhappy youth! These hostile towers contain no friend of thine. Elvine. What? has three seasons chang'd them? Am I then So soon forgotten? Edgar. Thou art not forgotten! Elvine. My God! What dost thou mean? Thy faultering tongue Forgets its office: My old friend thou weepest. Edgar. And I have cause to weep. These three score years, The humble native of your father's house, Or follower of your fortune, I have lived. Full many changes in the tract of time Sad have I seen! But ah! I little thought That I should live to see my noble master Denied the honours which his birth demands, Excluded from th'assembly of the Barons— Another lead the army. Elvine. Heavens! Another? Who is appointed to that high command? Edgar. Think of the man whom least you could expect; Think of the enemy of all your race; The Saxon Arden— Elvine. Arden! Gracious powers! Ah! where was Albemarle, my antient friend? Edgar. His favour raised him to that high command. Elvine. My father's friend, the father of Elvina, My mortal foe! The stroke of fate is come, And now the measure of my woes is full. Edgar. O thou hast heard as yet but half thy sorrows! I have a tale to tell, which I could wish To hide for ever from thine ear—Elvina— Elvine. What of Elvina?— Edgar. Arden's named her husband. Elvine [Fixed in astonishment. Elvina false! Elvina Arden's wife! Then there is nothing in the world for me: I've no connection with the human kind; No friend upon the earth. Let us depart. I spread my banners for the holy land. Let us be gone. Edgar. Elvina is not false. Ah! she alone was faithful to her friend. This day declares her honour and her love. Her father doom'd her to the arms of Arden, Whom she abhorr'd, and she refus'd to wed— Elvine. Then she's not wedded? Edgar. No. Elvine. All-gracious powers! She's constant, and she's mine? O God of heaven! What thanks are equal to a gift so great: The fair, the faithful, and the fond Elvina! Edgar. In her distress she wrote to thee to save her; The messenger was stopt; the letter found. She is condemn'd to chains! Yon prison holds her. I saw her looking from the iron grate, Her hands in fetters, and her eyes in tears: I could not bear the sight; I went a-part, And wept alone. Elvine. My love, my love, for me Thy hands in fetters, and thine eyes in tears! No chains, no prison, shall confine thee long— [Sounds of lamentation heard behind the scenes. What venerable Father stands aghast In yonder porch? Beneath the weight of years, And crush of sorrow, to the earth he bends. He wrings his hands; casts a wild look to heaven; And rends his hoary locks. He comes this way, Heavens! it is Albemarle!— Enter Albemarle. 'Tis over now! Curs'd be the hour that ever I was born! Eternal Justice! hast thou spar'd my youth, Yet doom'd thy servant in the dregs of life To drain the bitter cup? Hast thou reserv'd The vials of thy wrath to pour them down Upon this blasted head?— Elvine aside. My heart bleeds for him. He was my ancient friend. Albemarle. Almighty Power! Who on the feelings of a parent's heart Hast founded human life! and strongly bound By love's embrace the families of men: If thou art worshipp'd by a Father's name! Regard my anguish, and support my soul, For I am in despair! Elvine. Unhappy father! Whose woes bring tears into a stranger's eyes, May I inquire the cause? Can this right arm Redress the wrongs of age? Albemarle. Alas! alas! No human hand can save me from the gulph Which deep and dark discloses to my view. Before you stands the father most forlorn That ever bore the name. I had a daughter, The joy, the blessing, and the pride of age: I gave her hand to an illustrious Lord; But she betray'd us; she is doom'd to death— Elvine. Elvina doom'd to death!— Albemarle. A shameful death. But oh! what deeply wounds a Baron's honour! Heavens! am I fallen so low? No English youth Or noble of the land asserts her cause, And comes a champion to the lists of war. I rose in arms, and claim'd the cause myself: I am forbid the field.— Elvine. Elvina's cause Will bring a champion from the gate of heaven. Albemarle. Thou art the only comforter I've found; Thy voice alone relieves a father's heart. Let me embrace thee in my aged arms: I'll call thee son!—But Oh! a dreadful scene Begins to draw; the scaffold is prepared Soon to be dyed with blood; the ax is laid: The prison opens: The grim soldiers seize her; They drag my daughter forth . . . . to execution. And I—must I behold it?—Let me die! O death! thou angel of the wretched, come To my relief, and lay me with my fathers! Thou'rt thunderstruck, my son! Elvine. No power on earth— A scaffold! By th'Almighty! ere that day England shall stream, the scaffold of her sons. Albemarle. Yonder they come, the harbingers of death, In sad procession and with engines drear, The red-robed judges and the mitred priests, The grim, the ghastly ministers of fate: Support me, O my son!— [Enters Barons, Judges, &amp;c. with attendants. Arden to Albemarle. Depart, my friend. O if your daughter or yourself you love, Let me intreat your absence in this hour! Elvine. Do not depart. Albemarle. I will not leave this youth, He is my friend—alas, my only friend In this dire day. Arden. My duty binds me here. A sad spectator I must now remain To give due rites and dignity to law. But how wilt thou support a scene so dire? 'Twould make thy mortal enemy relent. Alas! it is not for a Father's eye. Albemarle. After what I have seen and felt this day, The flash that melts the globe, the voice that sounds The knell of nature, and the close of time, Would not amaze me—Heavens! is that the sound? [Dead march is heard. Back scene opening slowly discovers a scaffold, engines of torture, Executioners, &amp;c. Enter at the side-scene Elvina dressed in white, surrounded with Guards. Elvina. Barons of England, hear my dying words. A virgin, bold in conscious innocence, Will never stand a suppliant in your sight To move your pity by her prayers or tears. Nor will she tremble at a human bar, Who, greatly confident in him who made Her spotless heart, will on the moment's wing Ascend a spirit at the throne of heaven. —Barons, you gave a husband to my hand; My heart was wedded to another Lord. From all unnatural rule the soul revolts: The law of nature is the law of love. The noble mind determines its own deeds; Appeals to no tribunal upon earth, But answers to itself: There sits the judge, And the high counsellor who cannot err. Vile fetters you may throw on noble hands, And as a prisoned criminal confine The daughter of illustrious Albemarle. But the high mind, free and invincible, Spurns at the chain, the prison, and the ax. Here I avow it, dying I avow My love unaltered to that noble youth, And glory in the flame which makes me fall A virgin martyr to the man I loved. And, Barons, be assured, when you behold On yonder block the bloody ax descend, The death-felt blow will be the awful pang Which rends a father's and a lover's heart. Albemarle. Tremendous destiny! Alas! my son, Thy spirit groans. Big drops rush from thine eye. I am a parent, yet no tear I shed. Elvina kneeling. Eternal Father, now I come to thee! Receive me to thyself; into thy hands I give my parting spirit; I resign Myself a victim to my native land; Accept the sacrifice! Avert my doom Far from the heads of those who shed my blood; Support my father's age when I am gone, And he is desolate: Whatever years, Whatever joys, thou takest from my life, Repay to him with manifold increase. O may he never, never, never feel, In lonely sadness that he wants a daughter, And is a father now, alas! no more! [Rising she looks towards the scaffold. The signal for execution is heard. Elvine drawing his sword. This is my time: Unhand me!— Albemarle. Do not leave The helpless. I am dying. Oh! support me! [Falling into the arms of Elvine, is carried off. Elvina. [The executioners approaching. I come. Indulge me with a parting moment. My father, I have one request to make— Has he, too, left me? Now I am alone. Almighty Father! thou art with me still. My eye, that closes in the sleep of death, Looks up to thee to guide me thro' the gloom That frowns before my face; the dreary vale That darkly opens is the path to thee. Yet it is awful.—O sustain my soul! Stretch from the sky thine everlasting arms, Receive a martyr to the land of peace! [The Executioners throwing a veil over her. Elvine advances suddenly and removes them. Elvine. Avaunt! ye ministers of death! Avaunt! She shall not die. Elvina. O heavens! Whom do I see? 'Tis he! Almighty God! 'tis he!— [Falls down in a swoon. Elvine bears her off. Arden. What youth is this? A noble of the land His garb denotes. The Lady seem'd to know him. Methinks he's too familiar for a stranger. Barons. We know him not. Elvine returning with his sword drawn. Nobles, where is the man Who can accuse this Lady? Arden. I accuse her. And who dare say my accusation's false? Elvine. 'Tis one who dares whatever valour dared. 'Tis one who does whatever honour did. 'Tis I. I throw my gauntlet on the ground To prove thine accusation false as hell; False as thyself. Arden. Young man, I know thee not. Elvine. My friends have known me, and my foes have known me, Thou, too, shalt know me soon. Arden. Hast thou a name? It ill becomes the chieftain of an host With a raw wandering knight to break a spear. Elvine. Hear then, and tremble. You behold in me The man whom you have wrong'd, have deeply wrong'd. Arden. Young man, I never saw thee till this hour. No human form can say that I have wrong'd him. Elvine. So bold? Ha! didst thou not traduce this Lady? Defame her basely? wantonly? maliciously? And, with a villain's dagger, stab her fame? Eternal God! because a lovely maid Shrunk all-abhorrent from thy loathed arms, Thou, like a traitor, like a coward too; A cool, a cruel, cowardly assassin, Wouldst murder beauty, and, by form of law, Shed the pure blood of virgin innocence, Even like a criminal's upon the scaffold?— Arden. I did what justice, did what honour bade, I did my duty. What is that to thee? Elvine. To me! I meant not to declare my birth Till I had proved it. I have ever been Discovered by my deeds. Like Him in heaven Who in the majesty of darkness dwells, But sends the thunder to reveal the God. Behold the man whom all of you have wronged, The sole remains of an illustrious house, The last descendant of a noble line, Who merits by his birth, and by his sword, To lead the banners of the British host: Elvine. Arden , taking up the Gauge. 'Tis well. Thou'rt worthy of my sword. Elvine. There is a time, and this is sure the time, When noble virtue may assert itself, And conscious honour glow with its own fires. Barons of England, you have wrong'd me deeply! Who, crediting the lie of rumour false, Deprived a Briton of a Briton's right, Expell'd a Baron from a Baron's rank. He is a traitor to his native land, A traitor to mankind, who in a cause That down the course of time will fire the world, Rides not upon the lightning of the sky, To save his country. What, what had I done To merit such a name? Archbishop. Misled by fame, Indeed we injured you. Elvine. Why, then, redress The injury you've done. If, in the strife, Which must be mortal—Arden falls by me, I claim the honour which my birth demands, To lead the army. Barons. 'Tis indeed your due. Arden. Thou speak'st it vauntingly. The strife of tongues, The war of women, I did ever scorn. Now let the sword decide. Elvine. 'Tis drawn. Arden. Lead on. Elvine. I follow thee. Elvina comes this way. I would not meet her now. Edgar remain. Edgar, Elvina, Emma. Edgar. Unhappy maid! She comes from death. She looks As she indeed were risen from the grave A saint in glory! Let me kneel before her. Most noble Lady, graciously permit An old domestic of your father's house To kiss your garment, at your feet to fall With flowing tears. I hope your goodness still Remembers me. Elvina. I've not forgot you, Edgar; Nor will I e'er forget you. Rise, my friend. Edgar. Lovely and gentle! you was ever thus. Your face still shone upon your father's house, The face of a good angel. O what men, What murderers, could doom that beauteous form To such a death? Elvina. I have forgiven them, Edgar. Edgar. But Heaven will not forgive them— Elvina. Where is Elvine? Where has my father with the Barons gone? Thy colour changes. Ah! my heart forbodes The fear'd event. Is this the appointed hour For mortal combat?— Edgar. 'Tis indeed the time. Elvina. [Trumpets heard. The trumpets sound. The dreadful signal's given. Now life or death. Help, help me, Powers of Heaven! Support me, Emma!— Emma. Angels hover o'er him, And guard the hero with the shield of Heaven! Elvina. Run Edgar to the lists, and bring us tidings. Fain would I look—I dare not look that way. Hush! Hark! O Emma! Didst thou hear a groan? Emma. 'Tis midnight silence! Elvina. Let me look again. Yonder they meet. Behold the flash of arms! And lo the sword that shall be died in blood! Whose blood, O heavens! Turn Emma to the field: I'll look no more. Emma. Heavens! How I tremble! Ha! A mortal stroke! There rose the shriek of death!— Elvina. Now all is over, and my fate is fix'd. I'm destined now to rapture or despair, For ever and for ever! [A loud shout heard. O my heart! The army triumphs in their General's joy. My hero's fallen. I am gone again. My God! twice in one day!— Emma. I hear the sound Of feet approaching fast. Elvina. Let us be gone. [As they go out Enter Elvine. Where is my love? my life? Where dost thou fly, Thou first of women? Fairer to my sight Than e'er thou wast, and dearer to my soul! Return and bless my arms that stretch to strain thee— Elvina. Alive? O God— Elvine. Thou hast no foe. Thy cause, The cause of beauty, innocence, and love, Has made thy knight victorious in the field. Elvina. How shall I thank the saviour of my life? 'Tis thus! 'Tis thus! my Elvine!— [Running from the side scene into his arms. Elvine. My Elvina! At last we meet in joy. Elvina. To part no more. Oh! Elvine, but for thee my love, for thee, Alas! this day—O how shall I repay Thy matchless truth, thy tenderness, thy love? Elvine. In this embrace 'tis more than all repay'd. Enter Archbishop and Barons. Archbishop. Much injur'd youth, the victory is thine! We judg'd before we knew. Let loose from hell A lying spirit had deceived the land. We know thee now, the hero of the host. Exulting England owns her darling son. This day confirms what we have often heard, Thy deeds of prowess in the holy land; For thy renown flew grateful from the East, Like incense wafted on the wings of morn. We meant to serve our country, when, misled By rumours false, we blotted out thy name From the confederate Barons. Now in truth We serve our country, when with one accord We hail thee leader of the British host. Elvine. Your bounty, Barons, with a beating heart, I now accept: It was my early wish To lead an army in my country's cause; But hardly hop'd for such a glorious day, To lift the banners of the free, and mark The patriot spirit spread from man to man. Alike the danger, and the honour's dear. I march the foremost in the ranks of war, To live with freedom, or to die with fame. Archbishop. King John's ambassador has reach'd the camp. Now let us claim the hour of conference To have the charter of our freedom sealed.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE Runnamede. King John, Nobles, and Courtiers. John. Shall I resign the sceptre of my sires, And give the haughty Barons leave to reign? No! Perish all before that fatal hour. The majesty of Kings I will sustain, And be a monarch, while I am a man. [His Ambassador returns. What from the Barons? Ambassador. I have search'd their soul, And to their passions spoke; but spoke in vain. Haughty and high, like victors from the field, They speak in thunder, raise the eye to heaven, And tread with giant steps. John. So bold and fierce! Are not my veteran and victorious troops Superior to a military mob That never saw a camp? Ambassador. Superior far. But yet their spirit's high. No terms of truce, No composition will they now accept. John. Is not the leader of their army slain? Ambassador. Yes: But a braver general succeeds, The noblest name that Britain now can boast, The gallant Elvine. John. Thou hast nam'd a hero. Ambassador. Loudly they talk'd of grievances and wrongs, And pray'd to pour them in your royal ear. I nam'd this hour for friendly conference. Forgive me, gracious King, the time requires An union with your Barons. Loud and bold The Dauphin sends defiance to your host, And gives you battle at the evening hour. While France prefers a title to your crown, And comes to claim it with the pointed sword; My liege, your subjects must not be your foes. [Trumpets. John. The time will teach us: Hark! the Barons come. Enter Messenger. My liege, the trumpets of the host of England. John , to his Minister. Receive the Barons. [He retires into the Royal Tent. Enter Elvine, Albemarle, Archbishop, and Barons. Baron. Darker than the storm The Monarch frown'd, as he could shake the earth And move the kingdoms with his scepter'd hand. He does not deign to hear us. Elvine. He shall hear us. Loud as the trumpet that awakes the dead His people's voice shall thunder in his ears. King John's Minister. Barons, the sacred Majesty of England, Still watching for the people's weal, demands Why you have brought your forces to the field? Why you've unsheath'd the sword of civil rage? Against the brother raised the brother's hand, And arm'd the son against the father's life? Elvine. Compell'd by dire necessity, at last, We draw the sword: We draw it for ourselves: We draw it for our country, for our children, For every Briton down thro' every age. Ambassador. And do you rise with rash rebellious zeal To wrest the sceptre from your rightful prince, The delegate of heaven? Elvine. Long live the King, Our rightful prince! But let the Monarch know, That for his subjects, not himself, he reigns. Let Monarchs ne'er forget, that first the throne Rose in the camp; the Captain was the King; He wore the laurel as his only crown, And sway'd the sceptre when he drew his sword. Ambassador. And has a Monarch not his rights? Baron. He has. Even for the rights of majesty, we rise. Ambassador. Do subjects thus address their sovereign Lord? Baron. 'Tis not to thee, but to the King, we come. Nor come we suppliants at the throne to kneel. We beg not favours; we demand our rights: Rights ancient; indefeasible; divine: We come to treat, the Barons with the Prince, The host of England with the royal host. Ambassador. Averse to draw the sword, averse to shed His people's blood, our gracious Sovereign deigns An hour of audience to his Barons bold. Whatever suits the dignity of Kings The King will grant; your real grievances The royal ear is open to receive, The royal hand is stretched to redress. [The royal tent opens. King John , Descending from his throne. What do my people from their King require? Elvine. My sovereign liege, the nobles of the land, And all your faithful subjects, humbly greet Your gracious Majesty, who hast vouchsafed To hear their grievances: If we at last Find grace and favour in our sovereign's sight, Our joy will be complete; the civil sword Will then be sheath'd; Britannia rest in peace; The King be glorious, and the people free. John. What are the grievances that need redress? Have I e'er wrong'd you? What are your petitions? Archbishop. The antient Peers and Barons of the realm, The Reverend Fathers of the Holy Church, The hoary-headed Counsellors of State, And ministers of law, in council met, With one consent adopt the plan of rights Which our forefathers have delivered down, A sacred charge, and ratified with blood; A plan which guards the freedom of the isle, Which shields the subject, and enthrones the King. John. My Lord, it suits not with your holy function To rise in arms against your lawful prince, Who might remove the mitre from your head. Archbishop. Then he should mark the helmet in its place. John. Is not the priest the minister of peace? Archbishop. The priest of Jesus is the friend of man. John. And does the friend of man in horrid arms Let loose the wrath of war, and shake the land With dire commotion? Archbishop. If I judge aright, From such commotions revolutions rise, And still will rise, congenial to the isle. Tho' Britain's Genius slumber in the calm, He rears his front to the congenial storm. The voice of freedom's not a still small voice, 'Tis in the fire, the thunder, and the storm, The Goddess Liberty delights to dwell. If rightly I foresee Britannia's fate, The hour of peril is the Halcyon hour; The shock of parties brings her best repose; Like her wild waves, when working in a storm, That foam and roar, and mingle earth and heaven, Yet guard the island which they seem to shake. Elvine. Most gracious sovereign! let me interpose. Look to the host in yonder camp array'd! In such a cause the sword was never drawn: And never did the chivalry of England Arm in such majesty; or pitch their tents In such a field: No faction for themselves, But England arming in the cause of freedom. No vassal train attending on their Lord, But yeomen, knights, and all the noble youth. Lo! thousands press on thousands to the field! From every cloud of dust an army comes; The nation's on its march— John. Unfold your claims. What does this charter to my subjects grant? Elvine [Presenting it to him. Our antient rights and liberties derived Down from Great Alfred thro' the Saxon line, Confirm'd and seal'd by Edward the Confessor. John , [Perusing it in silence. Your rights! your liberties! This is rebellion. Presumptuous men! why do you not demand My kingdom too? Elvine. We are not foes to Kings, O King of England! have not stretched forth A rebel hand to overset the throne, Or of one jewel rob the British crown. Thine is the kingdom; may it long be thine! 'Tis liberty we ask; 'tis liberty, The kingdom of the people. Lo! the rights Our fathers have bequeathed us. Lo! the rights Which we bequeath to ages yet unborn. John. What rights do you, or did your fathers claim, But what a King can give and take away? Elvine. The rights of Britons, and the rights of men, Which never king did give, and never king Can take away. What, if a tyrant prince May rule at will, and lord it o'er the land, Where's the grand charter of the human kind? Where the high birthright of the brave? and where The majesty of man? John. My ancestor, William the Norman, won the British crown By dint of conquest. How did you obtain These rights of your's? Barons , [Drawing their swords. By these we gained our rights. With these we will defend them. John. Come you thus To dash rebellion in the sacred face Of sovereignty, and kneeling at the throne Conspire against the King? Elvine. May not the King Conspire against the people? John. Kings may err; But where's the power superior to the prince? Elvine. The King of England is the first of men: Yet there's a power above the King, the laws, Which, to the Monarch, as their subject, say, “Thus far, no farther, does thy power extend.” John. At whose tribunal can a King appear? Elvine. At the tribunal of the kingdom. John. Ha! Before whose majesty can he be brought? Elvine. Before the majesty of all the people. John. The voice of Kings alone should speak of Kings. Elvine. It is not mine with monarchs to contend. Our cause is brief. The nation's up in arms. The sword is drawn. This day decides our fate. 'Tis liberty, or death. John. Have you resolved To shed the blood of England, or to save? Elvine. Prepared for peace, prepared for war, we stand. Yon camp obeys the signal of their chief, And, at the motion of my lifted hand, Ten thousand swords will lighten in the field. My arm is stretched forth, and, if I draw The sword, I draw it to be sheath'd no more. John , [After a pause. Reluctant still to risk my people's life, Or shed their blood, I stand. Read your petitions. Whate'er the laws require, the King will give. Archbishop , [Holding Magna Charta. O King! O Chiefs! O Barons bold! O Britons! This Code of Freedom is that glorious prize For which the nations, from the first of time, Have toiled, have fought, have conquered, and have bled. The sages, lawgivers, and kings of old, Minos, Lycurgus, Solon, Numa, Alfred, Dion, Epaminondas, Cato, Brutus, Founders of nations, fathers of the laws, Patriots devoted to the public good, Heroes who for their country fought or bled, Martyrs of liberty who died for man, The glorious guardians of the human race, Look down divine, and bending from the sky, Their hoary figures consecrate the scene, And bless the passing hour. John. 'Tis well, 'tis well. What does your purpose aim at? Archbishop. To revive Our antient liberties; to found anew An empire of the laws; restore the rights Our ancestors from age to age enjoyed; To settle England on a solid base, The land of freedom; firm upon his throne To make the Sovereign of the British isle The greatest monarch of the greatest people. John. Deliver the particulars of your Charter. Archbishop. Let every Briton, as his mind, be free. His person safe, his property secure; His house as sacred as the fane of heaven; Watching, unseen, his ever open door; Watching the realm, the spirit of the laws. His fate determined by the rules of right, His voice enacted in the common voice And general suffrage of th'assembled realm. No hand invisible to write his doom; No demon starting at the midnight hour, To draw his curtain, or to drag him down To mansions of despair. Wide to the world Disclose the secrets of the prison walls, And bid the groanings of the dungeon strike The public ear. Inviolable preserve The sacred shield that covers all the land, The heaven-conferred palladium of the isle, To Britain's sons, the judgment of their peers. On these great pillars, freedom of the mind, Freedom of speech, and freedom of the pen, For ever changing, yet for ever sure, The base of Britain rests. John. These are the laws Of the Confessor, and to these I give A free, a full, and sovereign consent. But, while the common foe approaches nigh, Such a consent would seem th'effect of fear, Or trick of policy. Let us unite, And join our forces for the hour of war; The foe dispers'd, your charter shall be seal'd. Elvine. Prompted by duty we have drawn the sword To save our country; the same sword we draw To guard our King: In every common cause Britons will join against their native foes, And still the people in the King confide. John. United now, both armies bend their march To meet the Dauphin. None so fit I know [To Elvine. To lead the war as you, illustrious youth. The hour of evening bids the trumpet sound. Albemarle and Elvine. Albemarle. My noble kinsman, hail! I knew thee not. Beneath my roof, and with my daughter bred, Thou wast a son! Alas! at thought of thee Reproach knocks at my heart. Canst thou forgive? I need not ask, for thou art brave, my son. When we had wrong'd you deeply, sent of heaven, You came the better genius of the land, To save your country. Elvine. Clad in arms, I came To do my duty. Albemarle. You have saved the land. Your country, grateful to the sons of fame, Will charge herself with your illustrious meed. But, Elvine, how shall ever I repay The love and friendship you have shewn to me? Elvine. There's one reward—but 'tis too much for man, My highest hope, the treasure of my life— All that my heart beats for beneath the sun 'Tis yours to give, my Lord. Albemarle. Name it, my son. Elvine. The race of honour I have early run: I've liv'd to glory, I would live to love. Your daughter, fair Elvina,—in the days Of youth I loved her.—Were that matchless maid— Albemarle. Think of another choice.—Alas! my son! This is the pang that parents only feel! [aside. Elvine. To me there is no other choice. Ah! where, Where shall I find the rose of innocence, Youth in the flower, or beauty in the bloom, As in that peerless maid? Is she not fair? Is she not perfect in the prime of years, The spring of beauty, and the morn of youth? Albemarle. My son! the secret cannot be concealed. I have no daughter—worthy of thy arms.— Elvine. What? God of heaven! Elvina? Is she not The grace and glory of the female kind, As angels radiant and as angels pure? Albemarle. I thought so once. Elvine. Defend me, powers of heaven! What has she done?— Albemarle. Done? she has done a deed That never can be nam'd—has rent my heart— Elvine. O! she has been belied. I know her well. She is not to be judg'd by common rules; She left the crowd of womankind below; She walk'd aloft in a peculiar path, And sprung to excellence— Albemarle. Alas! my son, It cannot be concealed. The burst of fate Will come upon thee like the bolt of heaven. I cannot utter— [delivering a letter. These—these will convey A horrid tale—But words cannot express A father's anguish for a child that's lost.— [He goes out. Elvine alone reads the letter. Tremendous this? incredible! impossible!— These to the Dauphin—After these pretend To love me! God of nature! what is woman! At once to sink the vilest of her sex! To plunge precipitant down to the deep Of hideous hell; the dungeon of the damn'd!— [tearing the letter. Thus do I tear her from my soul for ever. Where am I now? There's not one beam of hope To light me thro' the infinite abyss!— One path there is, which all the brave must tread. It smiles upon my sight—Down, down my heart, A little while, thou shalt repose in peace, Nor feel the blow that false Elvina gave.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE, A solitary Heath, marked with the Ruins of an old Castle, here and there a blasted Tree. Elvine, Edgar. Edgar. Forgive me, noble youth! if I presume To rush unbidden on your secret hour. Alas! my Lord, you come not near the camp. From lovers and from friends you stand afar. Even from their tents you turn away your eye. Alone you stalk, with a disorder'd step, And a wild eye, as if indeed you stood A friendless man, and outcast from the world. Elvine. 'Tis past. What have I more to do with man? I am no member of the living world. No friend have I among the human kind. Edgar. My gracious master! Heaven prevent my fears! Alas, my aged heart will burst in twain To see this day!— [bursting into tears. Elvine. Come near me, O my friend, Say, dost thou know me?— Edgar. Know you? good my Lord! Descend, ye blessed angels, to his aid? Elvine. Edgar, the time has been when I was blest! That time can come no more. In yonder camp They think me happy, and they call me great. —There is not such a wretch in the wide world!— Edgar. O might I know what wounds your peace? Elvine , pointing to his heart. 'Tis here, The unseen dart that gives the mortal wound— The malady of mind—You've known Elvina— She is a fiend of hell— Edgar. My gracious master, If right you study your repose or peace, O judge not rashly of the maid you love! Elvine. I judged not rashly. Gods! what would I give To think her innocent? But, I've such proof: Such shining, flaming, damning proof; her hand, Her own hand-writing—Ah! departed hours That saw us happy, ye can ne'er return! The circle of my friends was all my world; That world has vanish'd—Oh! the dreadful fall Of those we love from honour and from fame, Comes like the general wreck—No future time, Not all the vast variety of thought, Can bring one smiling image to my mind; Can raise one ray of hope to break the gloom That closes o'er my head.—From thought to thought Restless I plunge; 'tis darkness; 'tis despair. Would I could think no more!— Edgar. Forget the false one. A worthless woman merits not a thought; Your country calls you. Rise to higher thoughts. The Dauphin comes. Elvine. Perdition on his name!— By heaven! he shall not find me unprepared!— O for the trumpet's sound! that I might rush To victory, to vengeance, and the grave! False as she is, yet I would wish to meet her; To see Elvina e'er we part forever! To pierce her with her perfidy, her baseness; To utter all the fullness of my heart, To vent the secret fondness of my soul; To let her know how blest she might have been! Heaven bless her still!— Behold she comes! Depart— Enter Elvina. And have I lived to hear the public voice Proclaim thy praise, and join a people's joy, To hail thee hero of this happy day? While with the shouts of freedom and of fame The camp re-echoes, and the nation rings; Say, Elvine, will the gentle voice of love Be grateful to thine ear? From tent to tent, Round all the camp, I ran to meet my love, And spring into his arms!— [He turns aside from her. Defend me, Heaven! What secret stroke has blasted all thy joy Amid thy fame? Why dost thou turn thine eyes From thy Elvina? Dost thou hide a grief Which I cannot partake, cannot console? O my heart beats for thee! Look on my face, O Elvine! O my love!— Elvine. I've known the time When Elvine's name, from his Elvina's voice, Which knows its tender way yet to my heart, Would have seduced me from my post in war. Now thou art chang'd!— Elvina. Chang'd! I can never change. O Elvine let me know— Elvine. Yes. Thou shalt know; And thou shalt hear me—for the last time hear me. For to the field of battle straight I go, From which, if steel can pierce an open breast, I never shall return. For Oh! Elvina, I cannot with thee—nor without thee, live! Elvina. My Lord, thy words I cannot comprehend; But, Oh! I tremble at thy look so wild. Elvine. Oh! once I loved thee! Gods! Gods, how I loved thee! Each night, retiring from the ranks of war, You came an angel to my constant dream. The dear idea met me in the morning. I ne'er put on my armour but I thought On her whose knight I was, whose scarf I wore. Even in the wildness of my youthful mind I never wandered from Elvina's charms. While she—O heavens!— Elvina. Guard me, ye gracious powers! Dark are your words, but they are daggers, Elvine! Have I deserv'd reproach from him I loved? O it was all my pleasure, all my pride, My joy in secret, and my public vaunt; It soothed me in the hour of my despair, That when your friends forsook you, I alone Was just and grateful to an injur'd youth; More just, more grateful, than he proves to me! Elvine. The child of fancy, and the fool of love, What golden scenes I figured to myself! In the day-dreams of my romantic mind, You rose in beauty, smiling by my side, My sweet companion in the path of life, The wife of youth, the mistress of my mind, The friend that never failed. O God! O God! The thought was heaven, when wearied of the world Upon that bosom to recline my head, To hear the music of that tender tongue, To drink enchantment from those radiant eyes, To feel the pressure of those circling arms! My God! from what a dream do I awake! The spell is broken, and the vision's fled. Witness these tears wrung from a tortured heart, The first that Elvine for himself has shed! What hast thou done, Elvina?— Elvina. Done, my Lord! I am afraid you are disturb'd in mind. Elvine. Disturb'd in mind! Yes, I'm disturb'd in mind. I've that within which none of all the damn'd Can bear in burning hell—for I have lost— O, I have lost the treasure of my soul! My heart is torn from all that it held dear— Elvina. I fear some traitor has abused thine ear. Come to particulars, I charge thee. Speak. Elvine. O woman! Woman! woman! ask thy heart. Elvina. O Elvine, 'tis a kind one! how it beats! Elvine. Yes it can beat—can beat for all mankind. I am your fool no more.— Elvina. Suspicion, Heavens! Dost thou not know me? What is there on earth Whereon to rest, but that eternal rock, The heart of those we love? And can that fail?— Alas! why didst thou save me from the sword To kill me thus? Would I had died this day! For then I suffered, then I would have died For thee!— Elvine. For me! This is th'extreme of guilt: Th'unpardonable crime! Serene to give The front of virtue to the soul of vice. For me! Elvina. Perhaps we ne'er shall meet again! In this last moment, Elvine! I conjure thee By the bless'd memory of what we were! By all the tender hours that we have pass'd! The days of dearness, and the loves of youth! Our fond romantic hopes of future bliss! The sighs we breath'd in sympathy of soul, The tears we mingled in that tender hour, You laid your cheek to mine, and fervent seal'd The sacred vow of everlasting love! By all that's past, I charge thee, tell me, tell What is that crime, so flagrant and so foul, To cast me from thy bosom? Elvine , in tender emotion. Oh! Elvina. Elvina. Oh! by the present sorrows of my soul! Plaints, which have sometimes touch'd a lover's heart; Tears! which a tender hand has wip'd away! And am I now an alien to thy love? Unfelt, unpitied, canst thou hear my voice Of lamentation, and unmoved behold The tears of her thou lovedst?— Elvine. Oh! Elvina! Tho' lost, I cannot see thee thus. Elvina. Then thus, Elvine, I claim my empire in thy arms. [Rushing to his arms. Elvine repulsing her. Off, off, false woman!—Ah! there was a time— Elvina with a broken voice. Heavens! Elvine. Hell! that is thy element. Elvina. What crime? Elvine. Oh! Infidelity. Elvina. What villain hath belied me? Elvine. No villain. Elvina. Who then? Elvine. Thy father. Elvina. What evidence? Elvine. Thy letter. Elvina. Where? Elvine. I tore it in my wrath, As I will rend that ruffian of a lover, And give his spirit to the shades of hell. [The trumpet sounds for battle. Lady, we part for ever and for ever! I go without a tear; for thou art fallen Below the most abandoned of thy kind. God! has that sex thy sanction to deceive? To shew a daemon in the shape of heaven, And look like angels, while the're devils damn'd! [Elvina standing fixed in astonishment and despair, Albemarle and Emma come up to her; she faints in their arms. Emma. She's gone! my noble Lady, gone!— Albemarle. Help, Heaven! Ye saints and angels, help—! [Bending over her in silence, Ha! she revives!— Elvina. Where am I now? Ah! it avails me not, For I can never be what once I was. Elvine is parted, never to return. Albemarle. The battle is begun. The sword is drawn. Convicted of thy falsehood, Elvine goes. Wild in the field to throw his life away, And bare his bosom to the certain sword Held out.— Elvina. He might have known, he should have known, That his Elvina never would prove false. Albemarle. How could he doubt it when I told him so? Elvina. My father my accuser! Albemarle. O, my child! Thy letter to the Dauphin— Elvina. To the Dauphin! No letter to the Dauphin I e'er sent. Albemarle. This morn the French Ambassador produced it Before the Barons: We have read it all. Elvina. O Heaven! that letter was address'd to him, To Elvine.— Albemarle. Elvine? Have a care, my child!— Elvina. To Elvine it was written—Emma knows it. Ha! when I ponder!—My disordered mind Forgot th'address.—The curs'd Ambassador Supplied the blank, and mark'd it for the Dauphin. Albemarle. O, this unfolds the fatal mystery! My child is innocent. [Taking her in his arms. Elvina. But I'm undone. Eternal destiny! this is thy work. Ready to rush upon the certain sword He goes devoted—Oh! he never knew How much I loved him! to distraction lov'd him! Knew not the throbs, the palpitations wild, Th'unutterable heavings of a heart Where reign'd his image.—Now to death he goes, And thinks me false—O heaven, amid my woes, My flowing miseries, for him I weep: For Elvine is as wretched—as Elvina! Albemarle. [Sounds heard. 'Tis o'er. The signal of pursuit is given. Emma. Crowds chacing crowds, and flashing arms I see, And garments stain'd with blood. 'Tis like the storm, When heaven, and earth, and ocean mingle war. Enter suddenly Edgar. The battle's over, and the foe is fled. Her sudden effort made, vain-glorious France Forsook the field. Elvina. Ha! Elvine? Where?— Edgar. Aghast, Long did he look this way, with aspect wild: His hands in agony extreme he wrung; With faultering voice, in broken sounds, he cried “I've conquered—now I perish—Oh! Elvina!” Then, with determin'd hand, his sword he drew, And instant plung'd amid the hostile ranks, Which clos'd behind him. Albemarle. Ah! illustrious youth, Cut off untimely in thy bright career, And all thy honours withered in the dust! Cold in the silent tomb, thou shalt not hear The song of triumph which thy country sings In honour of thy deeds; shalt not behold The tears of England which embalm thy name. Almighty! where was thine outstretched arm, When virtue struggled in the toils of fate, When honour perish'd in the villain's snare?— Elvina! mute and motionless you stand, No tender drops bedew thy fixed eye. A sullen sorrow darkens all thy features. Ah! save me Heaven! from that foreboding look— My daughter, shun the hour of desperation. Let us withdraw our steps. Elvina. Aye: To the grave. Albemarle. O look not on me with that eye forlorn! Elvina. Never, Ah! never shall I see him more!— Albemarle. No friend, no comforter have I on earth But thee, my child! My daughter, live for me.— Elvina. It glooms! Shall I not find thee in the tomb. Oh! Elvine! Elvine!— Enter suddenly Elvine. Here I am, Elvina— Forgive me, O my love! I knew thee not, I sought the Dauphin thro' the ranks of war; We fought; he fell the victim of my sword: It was th'Ambassador, like him array'd, Who told his guilt; thy innocence; and died. Angelic goodness! What can e'er attone For foul suspicion of thy spotless fame; Thou fairest, and thou best of woman kind? Elvina. Words cannot speak the language of my heart. 'Twas fatal destiny. Yet Elvine, know, The pang which pierc'd me most, was what thou felt. Elvine. Look on the past as but a dreary dream. Oh! let me find forgiveness in thy arms! [Embracing. Albemarle. Heavens bless you both, my children! Now, in peace, My hoary head shall to the grave descend. Enter in PROCESSION, Archbishop, Barons, Knights. Archbishop, with MAGNA CHARTA in his hand, To Elvine. By thee, great chief, the victory is won. And lo! the Charter of our freedom sealed! To Heaven, to heaven ascend eternal praise! Barons, the tears which trickle from those eyes, Are patriot drops; for Britain now is free! Albemarle. Let unborn ages echo to the sound! Now England, rising from the dust, resumes Her name among the nations, and unfolds The page of glory to remotest time. The memory of this day will raise a race Of daring spirits in the dregs of time. A nation of the brave, a kingly people, Bold in the cause of freedom and their fathers, And for their country prodigal of blood. Archbishop , in emotion. From future time the veil is drawn aside. The hidden volume opens to mine eye, And lo! they rise! Albemarle. He trembles, and he glows Like ancient prophets when they felt the God. Archbishop. Barons, this glorious day, this hallowed ground Shall never be forgot; to Runnamede, The field of freedom, Britain's sons shall come, Shall tread where heroes and where patriots trod, To worship as they walk! Albemarle. Rapt into heaven, High visions pass before the holy man; His tranced accent is the voice divine. Archbishop. The day of Britain now begins to dawn, Red in its rise. Heaven opens: And behold The hours of glory and the morn of men Ascending o'er the globe. An aera new, The last of ages now begins to roll, The reign of liberty. The Goddess comes Down from high heaven; her garment dyed in blood: The sword refulgent in her lifted hand. She looks: And fixes, never to remove, Her throne and sceptre in Britannia's isle. Elvine. O blest of heaven, who shall behold the day Of Britain shine! Archbishop. The Queen of isles behold, Sitting sublime upon her rocky throne, The region of the storms! She stretches forth, In her right hand, the sceptre of the sea, And in her left the balance of the earth. The Guardian of the globe, she gives the law: She calls the winds, the winds obey her call, And bear the thunder of her power, to burst O'er the devoted lands, and carry fate To Kings, to nations, and the subject world. Above the Grecian or the Roman name, Unlike the great destroyers of the globe, She fights and conquers in fair Freedom's cause. Her song of victory the nations sing: Her triumphs are the triumphs of mankind. FINIS.</field>
