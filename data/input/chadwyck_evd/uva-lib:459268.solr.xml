      <field name="fulltext">Nature, witte and will. Graunde Lady mother of euery mortall thynge: Nurse of the woorlde conseruatyue of kynd Cause of encrease, of lyfe and soule the spring. At whose instincte, the noble Heauen doth winde, To whose award all Creatures are assynde, I come in place, to treate with this my sonne, For his auayle howe he the path may fynde, Wherby his Race in honour he may runne: Come tender Childe, vnrype and greene for age, In whom the paret settes her chiefe delite, Witte is thy name, but farre from wisdome sage, Tyll tracte of tyme shall worke and frame aryght, This perelesse brayne, not yet in perfect plyght: But when it shalbe wrought me thinkes I see As in a glasse before hand with my syghte A certaine perfect peece of worke in the, And now so farre as I gesse by signes Some great attempte is fyxed in thy brest: Speake on my sonne wherto thy harte inclynes And let me deale to set thy hart at rest, He salues the sore that knowes the pacient best As I doe thee my sonne my chiefest care, In whom my speciall prayse and ioye doth rest, To me therfore these thoughtes of thyne declare VVitte. Nature, my soueraigne Quene and paret passyng dere Whose force I am inforst to know and knowledge euery where, This care of myne though it be bread within my breste, Yet it is not so rype: as yet to brede me great vnrest, So runne I to and fro, with hap suche as I fynde, Now fast, now lose, now hot, now cold, vnc?stant as that wind, I feele my selfe in loue yet not inflamed so, But causes moue me now and then, to let suche fancies go, Whiche causes preuailyng settes eche thing els in doubte Much like the nayle that last came in, &amp; dryues the former out. Wherfore my suite is thys, that it woulde please your grace, To settle this vnsetled head in some assured place: To leade me through the thyck, to guyde me al the waye, To poynt me where I maye atcheue my most desyred praye, For nowe agayne of late I kyndle in desire And pleasure pricketh fourth my youth to feele a greater fyre, What though I be to young to shewe her sport in bed, Yet are there many in thys lande that at my yeares doe wedde, And though I wed not yet, yet am I olde inowe To serue my Lady to my power and to begynne to woe. Nature. What is that Ladyes sonne which thus thy hart doth moue VVitte. A Ladye whom it myght be seeme hygh Ioue hym self to loue Nature Who taught the her to loue, or hast thou seene her face. VVitte. Nor this nor that, but I hard menne talke of her apace. Nature. What is her name? VVitte. Reason is her sire, Experience her dame, The Ladye nowe is in her flowers and Science is her name Loe where she dwelles, lo where my harte is all possest, Loe where my bodie would abyde, lo where my soule doth rest. Her haue I borne good wyll, these manye yeares tofore, But nowe she lodgeth in my thought a hundred partes the more, And since I doe perswade my self that thys is she Which ought aboue all earthly wyghtes to be most deare to me And since I wote not howe to compasse my desyre, And since for shame I can not now nor mynd not to retyre, Helpe on I you besech and bring thys thyng about Wythout youre hurte to my greate ease, and set all out of doubte. Nature. Thou askest more, then is in me to gyue, More then thy cause, more then thy state will beare They are two things to able thee to liue, And to liue so, that none should be thy peare, The first from me, proceedeth euerye where, But this by toyle and practise of the mind, Is set full farre god wot and bought full deare, By those that seeke the fruite therof to finde, To match thee then with Science in degree, To knit that knot, that few may reach vnto I tel the playne, it lyethe not in mee, Why should I challenge that I cannot doe But thou must take another way to woe, And beate thy brayne and bende thy Curiouse head, Both ryde and runne and trauayle too and froe If thou entend that famous Dame to wed. VVitte. You name your selfe the Lady of this world. Nature. It is true. VVitte. And can there be within this world, a thing to hard for you. Nature. My power it is not absolute in Iurisdiction For I cognise an other Lord aboue That hath receaued vnto his disposition The soule of man which he of speciall loue To gyfts of grace and learning eke doth moue. A worke so farre beyonde my reach and call, That in to part of prayse with him my selfe to show Myght sone procure my well deserued falle. He makes the frame and receiue it soe, No iotte therin altered for my head, And as I it reciue I let it goe, Causyng therin suche sparkles to be bredde As he commyttes to me by whom I must be ledde Who guides me first and in me guides the rest, All which in their due course and kind are spedde Of giftes from me such as may serue them best, To thee sonne witte he wild me to inspire The loue of knowledge and certayne seedes deuine Which ground might be a meane to bring thee hiere, Yf therunto thy self thou wilt encline The massy golde, the connyng hand makes fyne: Good groundes are tilde, as well as are the worste The rankest flower will aske a springyng tyme, So is mans wit vnperfit at the first. VVitte. Yf connyng be the key and well of wordly blysse My thinketh god might at ye first as well endue al with this. Nature. As connyng is the kay of blysse, so it is woorthy prayse The worthiest th?gs ar wonne wt pain in tract of time alwaies, VVitte. And yet right worthy things ther are, you wil c?fesse I trow, Which notwithstanding at our birth god doth on vs bestow. Nature. There are but such as vnto you that haue the great to name, I rather that bestow then wynne therby ymmortal fame, VVitte. Fayne would I learne what harme or detriment ensued, Yf any man were at his byrth with these good gyftes endued. Nature. There should be nothing lefte, wherin men might excell, No blame for sinne, no praise to th? that had defyned wel Uertue should lose her price, and learning would abounde And as man wold admire the thing that echewher might be fo?d, The great estate that haue of me and fortune what they wil Shold haue no nede to loke to those, whose heads are fraght wt skil The meaner sorte that nowe excells in vertues of the minde, Should not be once accepted there wher now they succor find For gret men should be spedde of al &amp; wold haue nede of none And he that were not borne to land should lacke to liue vpon These and fiue thousand causes moe which I forbeare to tel, The noble vertue of the mind haue caused there to dwell Where none may haue accesse, but such as can get in Through many doble dores, through heat, through cold, through thick and thinne. VVitte. Suppose I would addresse my selfe to seeke her out And to refuse no paine that lieth there about Should I be suer to spede? Nature. Trust me and haue no doubte, Thou canst not Chuse but spede with trauell and with tyme These two are they that must dyrect thee how to clime VVill. With trauel and with time, must they neds ioyne in one? Nature. Nor that nor this can do the good, if they be toke alone. VVitt. Time worketh all with ease, and gyues the greatest dynt In tyme softe water dropes can hollowe hardest flynt Agayne. with labor by it selfe, great matters compaste bee Euen at a gyrde in very lyttel time or none wee see Wherfore in my conceyte good reason it is Eyther this with out that to looke, or that with out this. Nature. Set case thou dyddest attempte to clyme Pernasus hill Take tyme fiue hundreth thousand yers &amp; l?ger if thou will Trowest thou to touch the top there of by standyng still Againe, worke out thy harte and spend thy selfe with toyle Take tyme with all or elles I dare assure the of the foyle VVitte. Madame, I trust I haue your licence and your leaue With your good wil &amp; so much helpe as you to me can gyue Wyth further ayde also, when you shal spye your tyme, To make a proffe to giue attempt this famouse hil to clime And now I here request your blessyng and your prayer For sure before I slepe I will to yonder forte repaire Nature. I blesse thee here with al such gifts as nature can bestow And for thy sake I would they were as many hundred moe Take therwith all this childe, to wayte vpon the stil. A byrde of myne some kinne to thee, his name is Wyll. VVitte. Wellcome to me my will, what seruice canst thou doe, VVill. All thinges forsooth, sir when me liste and more to. VVitte. But when wilt thou list, when I shall list I trowe VVill. Trust not to that, paraduenture yea, paraduenture noe, VVitte. When I haue neede of thee thou wilt not serue me soe, VVill. If yee byd me runne, perhappes I will goe: VVitte. Cock soule this is a boye for the nonse amongest twentie moe, VVill. I am plaine I tell you at a worde and a bloe, VVitte. Then must I pricke you childe if you be drowned in slouth Nature. Agree you twayne for I must leaue you both, Farewel my sonne: farewel myne owne good Will, Be ruled by Witte, and be obedient still, Force the I cannot but as farre as lies in me, I wil helpe thy master to make a good seruant of thee Farrewell. Exit VVitte. Adue Lady mother with thankes for al your peine And now let me bethincke my self againe &amp; eke again To matche with Science is the thinge that I haue toke in hande, A matter of more weight I see, then I did vnderstande Will must be wonne to this, or els it wil be hard Will must goe breake the matter first, or els my gaine is marde, Sir boye are you content to take such parte for me As god shall sende, and helpe it forth as much as lyes in thee. VVill. Ye a Mayster by his wounds or els cut of his head. VVitte. Come then &amp; let vs two deuise what trace were best to tredde, Nature is on my syde and Wyll my boye is fast, There is no doubt I shall obtayne my ioyes at last. Exent</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act 2. sena. 1. VVitte and VVill. VVitte. VVhat Will I say Wilboye come againe folishe elfe VVill. I crye you mercy sir you are a tall man your selfe. VVitte. Such a cokbraine as thou art I neuer saw ye like to it VVill. Truth in respect of you that are nothing els but Wit VVitte. C?st thou tel me thy err?d because thou art gone so sone, VVill. Can I remember a longe tale of a man in the moone, With such a circumstaunce and such flym flam I wyll tell at a worde whose seruante I am Wherfore I come and what I haue to saye, And cal for her aunswere, before I come awaye What should I make a brode tree, of euery litell shrubbe, And kepe her agreat whyle with a tale of a tubbe. VVitte. Yet thou must commend me to be rich, lusty pleasaunt and wyse. VVill. I can not commend you, but I must make twentie lies Rich quoth you, that appeareth by the port that you kepe, Euen as rich as a newe shorne sheepe Of pleasaunt conceiptes, ten busshells to the pecke, Lusty like a herringe, with a bell about his necke, Wyse as a woodcocke: as brage as a bodylouse, A man of your handes, to matche wyth a mouse: How say you, are not these proper qualities to prayse you with. VVitte. Leaue these mad toyes of thyne and come to the pythe One part of the errande should haue bene, To giue her this picture of mine to be seene, And to request her the same to accepte Safely vntill my comminge to be kepte, Which I suspende till thy returne and then If it like her Ladyshipppe to appoint me where and when I will waite vpon her gladly out of hande. VVill. Sir let me alone your mynde I vnderstand, I will handle the matter so that you shall owe me thankes, But what if she finde fault with these spindle shankes Or els with these blacke spottes on your nose. VVitte. In fayth sir boye this talke deserueth blowes. VVill. You will not misvse your best seruant I suppose For by his nayles, and by his fingers toe. I will marre your mariage if you do clitter. VVitte. I praye the goe thy wayes and leaue this clatter. VVill. First shal I be so bold to breake to you a matter. VVitte. Tushe thou art disposed to spende wordes in wast, And yet thou knowest this busines asketh hast VVill. But euen two wordes, and then I am gon. VVitte. If it be worth the hearing, say on. VVill. I would not haue you thinke that I for my part From my promise or fr? your seruice wil depart, But yet now and then it goeth to my hart, When I thinke how this mariage maye be to my smart VVitte. Why so? VVill. I would tell you the cause if I durst for shame. VVitte. Speke hardely what thou wilt without any blame. VVill. I am not disposed as yet to be tame, And therfore I am loth to be vnder a Dame, Now you are a Bachiler a man may sone win you Me thinks there is some good felowshippe in you, We may laugh and be meery at bord and at bedde, You are not so testy as those that be wedde, Myld in behauior and loth to fall out, You may runne, you may ryde &amp; roue ro?d about, With wealth at your will and all thinge at ease, Free franke and lusty, esye to please, But when you be clogged and tyed by the toe, So faste that you shal not haue power to let goe, You will tell me another lesson sone after And cry peccaui too except your lucke be the better: Then farewel goodfellowshyp then come at a call Then waite at an inche you idle knaues all, Then sparyng and pynchinge and nothing of gift, No talke with our maister, but al for his thrift, Solemne and sower and angry as a waspe, Althinges must be kept vnder locke and haspe, At that which will make me to fare ful ill. All your care shalbe to hamper poore wyll. VVitte. I warrant the for that take thou no thought, Thou shalt be made of, whosoeuer be set at nought As dere to me, as myne owne dere brother, Whosoeuer be one, thou shalt be an other. VVill Yea but your wyfe wyl play the shrew, perdy it is she that I feare VVitte. Thy message wyll cause her some fauor to beare, For my sake and thy sake and for her owne likewyse If thou vse thy selfe discretly in this enterpryse. VVill. She hath a father, a testy sower old man, I doubt lest he and I, shall fall out nowe and than, VVitte. Gyue hym fayre words, forbeare him for his age, Thou must consider hym to be auncient and sage, Shew thy selfe officious and seruisable stil, And then shall Reason make very muche of Will. VVill. If your wyfe be euer complayning, how then? VVitte. My wyfe wyll haue nothing to doe wyth my men. VVill. If she doe, beleue her not in any wyse. And when you once perceyue her stomacke to aryse, Then cut her short at the first and you shall see A meruaylouse vertue in that medisen to bee, Giue her not the bridle for a yeare or twayne And you shal see her bridle it without a reine, Breake her betymes and bring her vnder by force Or elles the graye Mare, wil be the better horse. VVitte. If thou haue done begone, and spende no time in vayne. VVill. Where shal I fynde you, when I come againe. VVitte. At home. VVill. Good enough take your ease let me alone with this Surely a treasure of all treasures it is, To serue such a mayster, as I hope him to bee, And to haue such a seruant as he hath of mee, For I am quicke, nimbell, proper and nise, He is ful good, gentle, sober and wyse, He is full loth to chide or to checke, And I am as willinge to serue at a becke, He orders me well and speakes me so fayre That for his sake no trauayle I must spare, But now am I come to the gate of this Ladye, I wyll pause awhyle to frame myne errante fynelye And loe wher she commeth yet will I not come nye her, But amonge these fellowes wyl I stande to eye her. sena 2. Reason, Experience, Science and VVill. Science. My Parentes ye knowe, howe many fall in lappes That do ascribe to me the cause of their mishappes? Howe many seeke that come to short of their desyre? Howe many do attempt that dayly do retire? Howe many roue about the marke on euery syde? How many thinke to hit when they are much to wyde? Howe many runne to farre how many light to lowe? Howe fewe to good effecte, their trauayle do bestowe, And howe all these impute their losses vnto mee. Should I haue ioye to thinke of mariage nowe trowe yee What doth the worlde my loue alone say they Is bought so dere that life and goodes for it must paye Stronge youth must spende it selfe, and yet when al is done, We here of fewe or none that haue this Lady wonne. On me they make outcryes and charge me with the bloud Of those that for my sake aduenture life and good This griefe doth wound my hart so, yt suters more as yet I se no cause nor reason why I shold admyt. Reason. Ah daughter say not so there is great cause and skill, For which you shold mislike to liue vnmaried thus alone What comfort can you haue remayning thus vnknowne How shal the common wealth by you aduaunced be If you abide enclosed here where no man may you see It is not for your state, your selfe to take the payne All straungers that resort to you to entertayne To suffer free accesse of all that come and goe To be at eche mannes cal to trauayle too and fro, What th?, synce god hath plast such treasure in your brest Wherwith so many thousand thinke by you to be refresht Needes must you haue some one of hyd and secret trust By whom these things may be, well ordered and discuste: To him you must disclose the depth of all your thought By him as time shall serue all matters must be wrought To hym aboue you must content your selfe to be at call Ye must be his, he must be yours, he must be al in all. Experience. My Lord your father telles you truth perdie And that in time your selfe shall fynde and trye. Science. I could aledge more then as yet I haue sayde, But I must yelde, and you muste be obayed Fall oute as it will there is no helpe I see, Some one or other in time must mary mee, VVill. In time nay out of hand, Madame if it please you, In fayth I knowe a yonker that will ease you, A lyuelye younge gentilman, as freshe as any flower, That wyll not sticke to marye you within this hower. Science. Such haste myght hapelye turne to wast to sum, But I pray thee my pretye boye whence art thou come. VVill. If it pleace youre good Ladyshype to accepte me soo, I haue a solemne message to tel or I goe, Not anye thynge in secrete your honour to stayne, But in the presence and hearinge of you twayne. Reason. Speake. VVill. The Lady of this world which Lady Nature hyght, Hath one a peereles sonne in whom she taketh delyght, On hym she chargeth men to be antendant styll, Both kynde to her, hys name is Witte, my name is Will, The noble chyld doth feele the force of cupydes flame And sendeth now for ease by counsel of hys dame, Hys mother taught hym fyrst to loue whyle he was younge Which loue wt age encreaseth sore and waxeth wondrous stronge For verye fame displayes youre bountye more and more, And at thys pyntch he burneth so as neuer heretofore Not fanteses force, not vayne and Idle toyes of loue, Not hope of that whych commenlye doth other suiters moue, But fixed fast good wyll that neuer shall relent, And vertues force yt shines in you bade him geue this attempte, He hath no neade of wealth, he wooes not for youre good, His kynred is such he nede not to seke to match with noble bloud, Such store of fryndes that where he lest he may commaunde, And none so hardy to presume hys pleasure to withstand, Youre self it is, your vertue and youre grace, Youre noble giftes youre endles prayes in euery place, You alone I saye the marke that he would hit, The hoped ioye the dearest pray that can befale to witte, Experience. I haue not harde a meyssage more trymlee done, Scince. Nor I, what age art thou of my good sonne, VVill. Betwene eleuen and xii, Madame more or lesse. Reason. He hath bene instructed this errand as I gesse. Science, How old is the gentilman thy maister canst thou tell? VVill. Seuentene or there aboute I wote not verye well. Science. What stature of what makyng what kynde of port beares he VVill. Such as youre Ladyshipe can not myslike trust me. Well growen, wel made, a stripling clean and taule, Wel fauored, somwhat black and manlye therewithal, And that you may conceaue hys personage the better, Lo heare of hym the vearye shape and liuely picture, Thys hath he sente to you to viewe and to behoulde, I dare aduouch no Ioynt therin no Iote to be controulde, Science. In good fayth I thancke thy mayster with my hart, I perceyue that nature in him, hath done her part. VVill. Farther, if it please your honour to knowe: My master would be glad to runne ryde or goe, At your commaundment to any place farre or neere, To haue but a sight of your Ladyshippe there, I beseech you appoint him the place and the hower, You shal se how redyly to you he wil scoure. Reason. Do soe. Experience. Ye in any wise daugher, for heere you mee, He semeth a right worthy and trymme younge man to bee. Science. Commend me then to Witte, and let him vnderstande, That I accept with all my hart this present at his hande, And that I would be glad, when he doth see his tyme, To heare and se him face to face, within this house of myne Then maye he breake his mind and talke with me his fyll, Tyll then adew both hee and thou myne owne swete little Will.

Here out my tale, I haue a mortall foe: That lurketh in the woode, hearby as you come and goe, This monstrous Giant, beares a grudge to me and mine, And wyll attempt to kepe thee backe, from this desier of thine. The bane of youth, the roote of ruine and desires: Deuouring those that sue to me, his name is Tediousnes. No soner he espyes, the noble Witte beginne: To styr and payne it selfe the loue of me to winne. But forth he steppes and with strong hands by might and maine: He beates and buffettes downe, the force and liuelynes of braine. That done in deepe dispayre, he drownes him villanously, Ten thousand suters in a yere, are cast away therby. Now if your mind be surelye fixed soe, That for no toyle nor cost, my loue you will forgoe. Bethinke you well, and of this monster take good heede, Then may you haue with mee, the greater hope to speede. Herein vse good aduise, to make you strong and stout, To send and kepe him of a whyle, vntill his rage be out. Then when you feele your selfe, well able to preuayle: Byd you the battell, and that so coragiously assayle. If you can wyn the field, present me wyth his head, I aske no more and I forthwith, shall be your owne to bedde. VVitte. Il might I thriue, and lacke that likes me best, If I be not a scourge to him, that bredes your vnrest. Madam assure your selfe, he liues not in the land, With whom I would not in your cause, encounter hand to hand. And as for Tediousnes that wretch, your common foe, Let mee alone, we twayne shall cope before I sleape I troe. VVill. Lustely spoken, let me claw thee by the backe: Howe say you now sir, here are three agaynst twayne, Studye. Go that go list, I will at home remayne, I haue more neede to take a nappe in my bedde.

And let vs three bestyre our selues like men. Unlikely thinges are brought to passe, by courage now and then. My wyll be alwayes prest, and ready at an ynche. To saue thy selfe to succour me, to helpe at euery pinche. Both twayne on eyther syde, assaulte him if ye can, And you shal see me in the middes, howe I wil play the man, Thys is the deadly denne, as farre as I perceaue, Approche we neere and valiantly let vs the vnset geue. Come forth thou monster fell, in drowsy darkenes hydde, For here is vvitte Dame Natures sonne, yt doth thee battaile bid. sena 2. Tediousnes, VVitte, VVill, Diligence. Tediousnes. What pryncox haue we heere, that dares me to assayle, Alas poore boy, and winest thou, against me to preuaile. Full smal was he thy frend, whoeuer sent the hyther, For I must driue the backe with shame, or slay thee altogether. VVitte. Great bost small rost, I warrant thee do thy best, Thy head must serue my tourne, this day to set my hart at rest. VVill. And I must haue a legge of the if I can catche it. Tediousnes.

Helpe, helpe, helpe &amp;c. Tediousnes. Where are these lustye blouds, that make their matche with mee? Here lyes a pattorne for them all, to loke at and to see. To teach them to conspire against my force and might, To promise for their womans loue, to vanquishe me in fight: Nowe let them goe and crake, howe wiselye they haue sped, Such is the end of those, that seke this curious Dame to wed. Hoh hoh hoh. sena 3. VVill. Recreation, VVitte. VVill. Rub and chafe him. For goddes loue hast, see loe where he doth lye. Recreation. He is not cold, I warrant him, I. Singe.

A wake ye drowned powers. Ye sprites for dull wyth toyle: Resyne to me this care of yours, And from dead sleape recoyle. Thinke not vpon your lothsome lucke, But arise and daunce with vs a plucke. Both sing giue a legge, as is before. 2 What thoughe thou hast not hit, The toppe of thy desyre, Tyme is not soo farre spente as yit To cause the to retyre, Arise and ease thy self of payne, And make thee stronge to fight agayne, Singe bothe.

What noise is this that ringeth in my eares, Her noyse that greueth my myshap with teares, Ah my mishap my desperate mishap, In whom ill fortune poureth downe, all mishap at a clappe, What shall become of me, where shal I hyde my head? Oh what a death is it to liue for him that would be dead? But since it chanceth so, what euer wyght thou be, That fyndeth me here, in heauy plight, goe tel her this from mee. Causles I perishe here, and cause to curse I haue. The time that erst I lyued to loue, and now must die her slaue, The matche was ouer much for me, she vnderstoode, Alas why hath she this delite, to lap in giltles blode. How did I giue her cause to shewe me this despyght, To matche me wher she wist full wel, I should be slaine in fight. But go and tell her playne, although to late for me, Accursed be the time and hower, which first I did her see. Accursed be the wyght, that wilde me first thereto, And cursed be they all at once, that had therwith to doe. Nowe get the hence in hast, and suffer me to die. Whom scornfull chaunce &amp; lawles loue, haue slaine most trayterouslye Recreation. O noble Witte the miracle of God, and eke of Nature: Why cursest thou thy selfe, and euery other creature. What causeth the thine innocent deare Lady to accuse? Who would lament it more then she, to here this wofull newes. Why wylt thou dye, wheras thou mayst be sure of health? Wheras thou seeth a playne path waye, to worship and to wealth. Not euery foyle doth make a fal, nor euery soyle doth slaye, Comfort thy selfe be sure thy lucke, wyll mend from day to daye. VVill.

VVitte. Ah Wyll art thou aliue, that doth my hart some ease, The sight of the swete boy, my sorowes doth appeace: How hast thou scapte, what fortune the befell? VVill. It was no trusting to my handes, my heeles did serue me wel I ran wyth open mouth, to crye for helpe amayne, And as good fortune would, I hit vpon these twayne. VVitte. I thanke both thee and them, what wyll ye haue me do. Recreation. To ryse and daunce a little space with vs two? VVitte. What then. Recreation. That done, repayre agayne to Studie and Instruction, Take better hould by their aduise, your foe to set vpon. VVitte. Can any recompence recouer this my fall?

Will daunsing serue, and I will daunce vntil my bones be sore, Pype vs vp a Galiard mynstrel, to begynne, Let vvill call for daunces, one after an other. VVill. Come Damsell in good fayth, and let me haue you in, Let him practise in daunsing al things to make himselfe brethles. Recreation. Enough at once, now leeue, and let vs part. VVitte. This exercise hath done me good, euen to the very hart. Let vs be bould with you, more acquaintaunce to take And daunce a round, yet once more for my sake, Enoughe is enoughe, farewel, and at your neede: Use my acquaintaunce if it may stande you in steede. Right worthy Damsels both, I knowe you seke no gaynes, In recompence of this desert your vndeserued paynes. But loke what other thinge my seruice maye deuise, To shewe my thankefull harte in any enterprise. Be ye as bolde therwyth, as I am bold on you, And thus wyth hartye thankes, I take my leaue as nowe. Recreation. Farewell frend Witte, and since you are relieued, Thynke not vpon your foyle, whereat you were so grieued. But take your hart to you, and giue attempte once more: I warrant you to speede, much better then before. sena 4. VVitte, VVill, Idlenes, Ignoraunce. VVitte.

Idlenes syngeth. Come come lye doune and thou shalte see, Non lyke to mee to entertayne, Thye bones and thee opprest wyth payne, Come come and ease thee in my lappe, And yf it pleace thee take a nappe, A nappe that shall delight thee soo, That fancies all wyll thee forgoe, Bye musinge styll what canst thou fynde, But wantes of wyll and restles mynde, A mynde that marres and mangles all, And breadeth iarres to worke thy falle, Come gentle Witte I thee requyre, And thou shalt hytt thy chiefe desyre, Thy chiefe desire thy hooped praye, Fyrste ease thee here and then away, VVitte. (Falle doune in to her lapp.) My bones are styff and I am wearyed sore, And still me thynck I faynte and feble moore and moore, Wake mee agayne in tyme for I haue thinges to doe, And as you wyll mee for myne ease, I doe assent thereto, Idlenes. (Lul hym.) Welcome wyth all my harte: Syr boye houlde here thys fan, And softly coole his face slepe sowndly gentleman, Thys chayer is chared well now ignoraunce my sonne, Thou seest all this howe fittlye it is done, But wotste thou whye?

Doste thou remember how many I haue serued in the like sorte, Ignoraunce. It doth my hart good to thyncke on this sporte Idlenes. Wylte thou see thys proper fellowe serued soe, Ignoraunce Choulde geue twaye pence to see it and tway pence moore, Idlenes. Come of then, let me see thee in thy doublet and thy hose. Ignoraunce. You shall see a taule felow mother, I suppose, Idlenes. Helpe of with this sleue softly, for feare of waking, Wee shal leaue the gentilman, in a pretie takinge. Giue me thy Cote, hold this in thy hand: This fellowe would be maried to Science I vnderst?d. But or we leaue him, tell me an other tale: Now let vs make him loke, some what stale.

Idlenes. Sleape sound and haue no care, to occupie thy head, As neare vnto thy body now, as if thou hadst ben dead. For Idelnes hath wonne, and wholly the possest, And vtterly dishabled thee, from hauing thy request. Come on with me my sonne let vs goe coutche againe, And let this lusty ruffling Witte, here like a foole remayne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Act. 5 sena 1. VVitte, Science, Reason. VVitte. Up and to goe, why sleape I here so sound: How fals it out that I am left vpon the naked ground. God graunt that all be well, whylest I lye dreaming here: Me thinckes all is not as it was, nor as I would it were, And yet I wot not why, but so my fancies giues mee: That some one thinge or other, is my tryer that greues mee. That are but fancies let them goe, to Science now wyll I, My sute and busines yet once againe, to labor and aplye. Science. What is become trow yee, of Witte, our spouse that would be: Reason. Daughter I feare all is not, as it should bee. VVitte. Yes yes haue ye no doubt, all is and shalbe well: Reason. What one art thou? therof howe canst thou tell. VVitte. Reason most noble sir, and you my Lady deare: How haue you done in all this time, since first I sawe you here? Science. The foole is mad I wene, stand backe and touch me not. VVitte. You speake not as you thinke, or haue you me forgot, Science. I neuer saw thee in my life, vntil this time I wotte, Thou art some mad braine, or some foole, or some disguised Scot. VVitte. Gods fishe hostes, and knowe you not mee. Science. I had bene well at ease in deede, to be acquainted wyth thee. VVitte, Hope haliday, mary this is preety cheere, I haue lost my selfe, I can not tell where An olde sayd sawe it is, and to true I finde, Soone hot, sone cold, out of sight, out of mind. What maddam, what meaneth this sodaine change, What meanes this scornefull looke, this counten?ce so straunge. It is your fashion so to vse, your louers at the furst: Or haue all women this delite, to scould and to be curst. Reason. Good felow whence art thou, what is thy name? VVitte. I weene ye are disposed to make at me some game. I am the sonne of Lady Nature, my name is Witte. Reason. Thou shalt say soe longe enough, or we beleue it. Science. Thou Witte? nay thou art some madde braine out of thy wit. VVitte. Unto your selues, this triall I remit. Loke on me better, and marke my personne well, Science. Thy loke is like to one, that came out of hell: Reason. If thou be Witte, let see, what tokens thou canst tell. How comst thou first acquainted here? what sayd wee? How did we like thy sute, what intertaynment made wee? VVitte. What tokens? Science. Yea what tokens? speake and let vs know? VVitte. Tokens good store I can reherse a rowe. First as I was aduised, by my mother Nature: My lackey Will, presented you with my picture. Science. Stay there? now loke how these two faces agree: VVitte. This is the very same that you receyued from mee. Science. From thee? why loke, they are no more like: Then chalke to cheese, then blacke to white. Reason. To put thee out of doubt, if thou thinke we saye not true, It weare good for thee, in a glasse thy face to viewe. VVitte. Well remembred, and a glasse I haue in deede, Whych glasse you gaue me, to vse at neede. Reason. Hast thou the glasse, which I to Witte did gyue. VVitte. I haue it in my purse, and will kepe it while I lyue. Reason These markes me muse, howe should he come therby: VVitte, Sir muse no more for it is euen I. To whome you gaue the glasse, and here it is. Reason. Wee are content thou trye thy case by this. VVitte. Eyther my glasse is wonderfully spotted, Or els my face is wonderfully blotted. This is not my Cote, why wher had I this weede, By the Masse I loke like a very foole in deede. O heapes of happes, O rufull chaunce to me, O Idlenes woo worth the time, that I was ruled by thee. Why did I lay my head, within thy lappe to rest? Why was I not aduised by her, that wissht and wil me best. O ten times troble blessed wights, whose corpes in graue do lye: That are not driuen to behould, these wretched cares which die. On me your furies all on me, haue poured out your spite, Come nowe and slay me at the last, and ridde my sorowes quite. What coast shall me receyue, wher shal I shew my head: The world wyll saye this same is hee, that if he list had sped. This same is he that toke, an enterpryse in hand, This same is hee that scarce one blow, his ennemy did withstand. This same is he that fought, and fell in open field: This same is he that in the songe, of Idlenes did yelde. This same is he that was in way, to winne the game: To ioyne himselfe wherby he should, haue won immortal fame. And now is wrapt in woe, and buried in dispayre, O happye cace for the if death would rid the quite of care. sena. 2. Shame, Reason, Science, VVitte. Reason. Shame. Shame. Who calls for shame? Reason. Here is a marchant Shame, for thee to tame. Shame. A shame come to you all, for I am almost lame, Wyth trudging vp and downe, to them that lose their game, Reason. And here is one whom thou must rightly blame, That hath preferde his folly to his fame. Shame. Who? this good fellowe, what call you his name? Reason. Witte? that on wooing, to Lady Science came. Shame. Come aloft child let me see, what friscoles you can fet, Reason. He hath deserued it, let him be well bet. VVitte. O spare mee wyth the whippe, and sley mee with thy knife: Ten thousand times more deare to mee, were present death then lyfe Shame. Naye naye my frend, thou shalt not die as yet. Reason. Remember in what case, Dame Nature left thee Witte, And how thou hast abused the same. Thou hast deceaued all our hope as all the world may see. Shame. A shame come to it. Reason. Remember what fayre words, and promises thou diddest make, That for my daughters loue, no paynes thou wouldest forsake. Remember in what sorte, we had a care of the: Thou hast deceyued all our hope, as all the world may see. Shame. A shame come to it. Reason. Remember how Instruction, should haue bene followed styll, And howe thou wouldest be ruled, by none but by Wyll. How Idelnes hath crept, and raigneth in thy breast, How Ignoraunce her sonne, hath wholly thee possest. Shame. A shame come to it. VVitte. O woofull wretch to whom shall I complaine, What salue may serue to salue my sore, or to redresse my payne. Naye I can tell the more: remember howe, Thou was subdued of Tediousnes right nowe. Remember with what crakes thou went vnto hys denne, Against the good aduise, and Counsell of thy men, What Recreacion did for the, in these thy rufull happes, And howe the second tyme, thou fell into the lappe. Shame. A shame come to thee. VVitte. O let me breath a whyle, and hold thy heauy hand, My greuouse faultes with shame enoughe I vnderstande. Take ruthe and pittie on my playnt, or els I am forlorne, Let not the world continue thus, in laughing mee to scorne. Madame if I be hee, to whom you once were bente, With whom to spend your time, sometime you were content. If any hope be left, if any recompence, Be able to recouer this for passed negligence. O helpe mee now poore wretche in this most heauy plight, And furnishe me yet once agayne, wyth Tediousnes to fyght. Science. Father be good to these yonge tender yeares, See howe he doth bewayle his folly past with teares, Reason. Hould slaue take thou his Coote for thy labor, We are content at her request, to take you to our fauor. Come in and dwell with vs, til time shall serue: And from Instruction rule, loke that thou neuer swerue Wythin we shall prouide, to set you vp once more, This scourge hath taught you, what defaulte was in you heretofore sena 3. VVill. Once in my life I haue, an od haulfe hower to spare: To ease my selfe of all, my trauaile and my care. I stoode not still so longe this xx. dayes I weene, But euer more sent forth on messages I haue bene. Such trudging and such toyle, by the masse was neuer seene, My body is worne out, and spent with labor cleane. And this it is that makes me loke so leane. That lettes my groth, and makes me seene a squall, What then althoughe my stature be not tall. Yet I am as proper as you, so neate and clenlye, And haue my ioyntes at commaundement full of acteuitie, What should a seruaunt do, wyth all this fleshe and bones, That makes them runne with leaden heeles, &amp; stur them self like stoones Giue me a proper squier much after my pitche And marke howe he from place, to place will squitche. Fayre or foule, thicke or thinne, mire or dusty, Clouds or rayne, light or darke, cleare or mystie. Ride or runne, to or froe, badde or good, A neate litle fellowe, on his busynes wyll scud. These great labores are neyther actiue nor wyse, That feede till they slepe, and sleape out their eyes. So heauy, so dul, so vntoward in their doinge, That it is a good sight, to see them leaue working. But all this while, while I stand prating here, I see not my mayster, I left hym snorting here, sena 4. Science, VVitte, VVill, Instruction Studie Diligence Tediousnes. Science. Myne one deare Witte, the hope of mine auaile, My care, my comfort, my treasure and my trust, Take hart of grace, our ennemye to assaile, Lay vp these thynges, whych you haue hard discust. So doinge, vndoubtingly you can not fayle. To winne the fyeld to scape. all these vnhappy shewers, To glad your frendes, to cause your foes to wayle, To matche wyth vs, and then the gayne is youres. Here in this Closet our selfe, wil sette and see, Your manly feates, and your successe in fyght: Strike home couragiously, for you and mee, Learne wher and howe to fende, and howe to smite: In any wyse, be ruled by these three, They shall direct both you, and Wyll aryght. Farewell and let our louing counsell bee At euery hande before you in your fyght, VVitte. Here in my sight good Maddam sitte and viewe: That when I list, I may loke vppe on you. This face this noble face, this liuely hiew, Shal harden mee, shal make our enemye rue. O faythful mates, that haue this care of mee: How shal I euer recompence, your paynes wyth gold or fee. Come now and as you please, enioyne me how to doe it, And you shall see me preest, and seruisable to it. VVill Why mayster whyther way, what hast am I no body? Instruction. What Will, we maye not mysse thee, for no money. VVitte. Welcome good Wyll, and doe as thou art bydde, This daye or neuer, must Tediousnes be ridde. VVill. God spede vs well, I will make one at all assayes. Instruction. Thou shalt watche to take him at certayne bayes, Come not in the thronge, but saue thy selfe alwayes. You twayne on eyther syde, first wyth your sword and buckler. After the first conflict, fight wyth your sworde and daggers, You sir with a Iaueling and your Targett in your hand, See how ye can, his deadly strokes wythstand. Kepe at the foyne, come not wythin his reache, Untyll you see, what good aduauntage you may ketche. Then hardly leaue him not, tyll time you strike him dead, And of all other partes, especially saue your head. VVitte. Is this all, for I would fayne haue done? VVill. I would we weare at it, I care not how sone. Instruction. Now when ye please, I haue no more to tell, But hartely to praye for you, and wyshe you well. VVitte. I thancke you, goe thou and bidde the battayle Wyll. VVill. Come out thou monster fell, that hast desire to spill, The knot and linked loue, of Science and of Witte, Come trie the quarel in the fyeld, and fyght with vs a fitte. sena. 5. Tediousnes, VVitte, VVill, Instruction, Studie, Diligence. Tediousnes. A doughtie durte these iiii. boyes will doe, I will eate them by morsels two and two. Thou fyghteste for a wyfe a rod a rodde, Had I wist this, I would haue layed on loade, And beate thy brayne and thys my cloobe together, And made thee safe inoughe for retourninge hyther, VVill. A foule horesone what a sturdie thife it is? But we wyll pelt thee knaue vntill for woe thou pisse, Tediousnes. Let me come to that elfe. VVitte. Nay nay thou shalt haue worke inoughe to saue thy selfe, Fight. Instruction. Take breath and chaunge your weapones playe the men, Some what it was that made thee come agaen, Thou stickest some what better to thy takling I see, But what, no force ye are but Iack sprot to mee. VVitte. Haue houlde heare is a morsell for thee to eate, Studie, Instruction. Here is a pelt to make youre knaues hart freete, Diligence. There is a blowe able to fell a hogge, VVitte. And here is a foyne behynde for a madde dogge, Let will trippe you downe. Houlde houlde houlde the lubber is downe, Tediousnes. Oh VVill. Stryke of his hed whyle I houde hym by the crowne, VVitte. Thou monstrous wretch, thou mortall foe to me and myne, Which euermore at my good lucke and fortune didest repyne, Take here thy iuste desert and payment for thy hire. Thy hed this day shall mee prefer vnto my hartes desyre, Instruction. O noble Witte, the prayse, the game is thine, Studie. Houe vp his head vpon your speare, soe here a ioyfull signe. Diligence. O valiant Knighte, O conquest full of prayes. VVill. O blest of god to see these happie dayes. VVitte. You you, my faithful Squiers deserues no lesse, Whose tried trust, well knowen to mee in my distres. And certain hope of your fixt fayth, and faste good will, Made me attempt this famouse fact most nedefull to fulfill, To you I yeald great thancks, to me redownds the gaine, Now home a pace, and ringe it out, that Tediousnes is slayne. Say all at once, Tediousnes is slaine. sena. 6. Science, VVitte. Science. I heare and see the ioyfull newes, wherin I take delight, That Tediousnes our mortall foe, is ouercome in fight. I see the signe of victorye, the signe of manlines: The heape of happy happes: the ioy yt tongue cannot expresse. O welcome fame from day to day for euer shal arise. VVitte. Auaunt ye griping cares, and lodge no more in mee, For you haue lost, and I haue wonne continuall ioyes and fee. Nowe let me freely touche, and freely you embrace, And let my frendes with open mouth proclame my blisfull case. Science. The world shall know doubt not, and shal blow out your fame, Then true report shall send abrode, your euerlasting name. Nowe let our parentes deere, be certifyed of this, So that our mariage may forthwith procede as meete it is. Come after mee all fiue, and I will lead you in. VVitte. My payne is paste, my gladnes to beginne, My taske is done, my hart is set at rest, My foe subdued, my Ladyes loue possest. I thancke my frends, whose helpe I haue at neede, And thus you see, howe Witte and Science are agreed, Wee twaine hence forth one soule, in bodyes twayne must dwel Reioyse I praye you all with mee, my frendes and fare ye well.
