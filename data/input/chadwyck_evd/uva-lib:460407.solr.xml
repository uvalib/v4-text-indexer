      <field name="fulltext">ROMULUS AND HERSILIA.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PERSONS OF THE DRAMA. Romulus, King and founder of Rome. Hersilia, a Sabine Princess. Valeria, a noble Roman lady, in love with Acrontes, forsaken by him. Hostilius, a Roman patrician, friend to Romulus, in love with Valeria. Curtius, Prince of the Antemnati, father of Hersilia. Acrontes, Prince of the Ceninensians, an implacable enemy to Romulus. Chorus of the Roman people.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">The action is represented in the ancient city of Rome.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. A great square in Rome, surrounded with private and public buildings, part unfinished, intermixed with trees. The Capitol, with a rustic appearance, an altar and a fire kindled before an ancient oak consecrated to Jupiter, from which are paths leading down to the plain. The altar, the mountain, the buildings and the trunks of the trees adorned with festoons of flowers, in honour of the solemnization of the nuptials between the Roman youths and the Sabine virgins. A numerous crowd of Warriors, Lictors, and People, spectators. While to the sound of various instruments, that accompany the following Chorus, the new married couples descend by several paths from the hill, and mix in a dance upon the plain, Romulus with Hersilia, and Hostilius with Valeria, by different paths slowly follow the procession, and none remain above but a number of priests round the altar of Jupiter. Chorus. Propitious from Olympus' height, On glad Tarpeia's rock alight, And every happy nuptial rite. Protecting Powers! attend. Part Chorus. O! God of arms! do thou inspire In manly breasts the hero's fire, And bid the virtues of the fire From son to son descend. Chorus. Propitious from Olympus' height Protecting Powers! attend. Part Chorus. O! Goddess! whose benignant care Can man's decaying race repair, The hearts of these, the brave and fair, Inflame with faithful love. Chorus. Propitious from Olympus' height, On glad Tarpeia's rock alight, And every happy nuptial rite, Protecting Powers! attend. Rom. At length, O! most ador'd, and conquering fair, Who triumph o'er your victors, we behold Your hands with Romans join'd in spousal vows. Since Heaven has granted to this infant kingdom In you its dearest hopes, Ah! make with us The sweet exchange of love: for not impell'd By hatred or revenge, or heat of youth, The Roman valour sought so dear a prize. Ah! deem more nobly of us. With the bands Of near alliance would we hope to change Our enmity to friendship. Well you know. That in a chaste asylum; midst a train Of holy matrons, in the guardian care Of Heaven, you have resided, till subdued By every merit of respectful service, You willingly fulfill'd the solemn rites. Disdain not then these humble first attempts To found a warlike race. The Gods prescribe No bounds for virtue. Yonder Capitol, Now rustic and unknown, in times to come May boast a mightier name. My heart dilates With every glorious hope. And you, ye fair! (Now Roman consorts) will with us partake One common fate; and while your minds revolve The present nuptials and the future trophies, O! second with your love these happy omens. Chorus. Propitious from Olympus' height On glad Tarpeia's rock alight, And every happy nuptial rite Protecting Powers! attend. [while this Chorus is singing the married couples join again in a dance and go out.] SCENE II. Romulus, Hersilia, Hostilius, Valeria. Rom. [to Her.] And midst so many, whom this day has bless'd, Belov'd Hersilia! must I still remain Uncertain of my fate? Her. O! Heaven! [aside. Host. [to Val.] And say, Cannot the example of the Sabine rigour Subdu'd at length, for me, Valeria, move One Roman virgin's heart? Val. Ill-fated love! [aside. Rom. Ah! princess, speak. Her. By thee I was requested, Not as a bride, but as spectatress, here To attend the sacred rite: I yielded to thee: What can I further say? To thee are known The duties that engross Hersilia's thoughts: Thou know'st I am a Sabine and a daughter. Rom. I know I must not hope to obtain thy hand, Unless 'tis granted by thy noble father; And, trust me, I in thee admire and love A daughter's strict obedience. Since he first Repuls'd me harshly, I've again renew'd My earnest suit. Ah! while I trembling wait Th' eventful issue, give me comfort: say, What share have I, Hersilia, in thy heart? Say, dost thou love me? If the true affections Of faithful loversâ Her. Romulus, Ah! cease, And do not forfeit thus the former merit, Of all thy generous cares. Rom. What crime is mine? Her. Freedom of speech, like this, to Sabine dames, Our country's usage gives not: never words Of fond endearment there escape the lips, 'Till first the altar sanctifies the passion. Rom. What charm has beauty when with virtue grac'd! to Host. Go, friend, and second my impatienceâgo, Ask if the wish'd-for messenger returns; Moments are ages to me. Host. More than you The Roman people brook not this delay. Eager they languish with their king to see A consort on the throne. Already now 'Tis whisper'd thou should'st in thy thoughts revolve Some other bride more easy to be won. Rom. Some other bride! Ah! never must they hope Hersilia can be banish'd from this bosom. Behold the fair, decreed by love My fondest thoughts to claim: 'Tis she, and she alone shall prove The object of my flame. Till now the Gods, of all her kind Ne'er fram'd a maid so fair: But with the virtues of her mind, No outward charms compare. [Exit with Host. SCENE III. Hersilia, Valeria. Val. And does not then our hero, my Hersilia, Seem worthy to be lov'd? And if his rule Cannot sometimes restrain a headstrong people, At least his wisdom well atones for all. Her. I see it truly. Val. Does thy heart meantime Plead nothing in his cause? Her. I praise his virtues. Val. But tell me; does Hersilia love or hate him? Her. Alas! my friend; I know not what I feel: A thousand passions struggle in my bosom, Unknown before; and Romulus has left His looks and words engraven in my soul. To me he seems the greatest, and the best The first of mortals! But, alas! to me What, what avails it? Shall Hersilia prove A rebel to a father's sacred will? Forgetful of the Sabines' rigid duties, Cast off her wonted constancy of spirit For which she once was fam'd'd?âO! never, never! Thou God, who rul'st the feeble mind, Now vainly seek'st in me to find What sways so oft the female kind, Thou art no God for me. In vain thy threaten'd chains prepare: With firmness arm'd to break the snare; My soul, for ever free, shall dare Thy boasted chains and thee. [Exit. SCENE IV. Valeria alone. Yes, sage Hersilia, though she little knows it, Is warm'd with love, but warm'd with noble fire; Whilst I, unhappy as I am, adore A false, ungrateful lover. Well I know By many a proof Acrontes has deceiv'd me;â What do I see!âHe comesâ And yet, O! Heaven!â SCENE V. Enter Acrontes in a Roman habit. Acr. [sees her as he enters.] I'll-fated meeting. Val. Whither dost thou go? O! unadvis'dâwhile all the Sabine race Conspire the fall of Rome; wilt thou, a Sabine, In borrow'd vesture, risk thy safety here? Acr. I fear no risk to bless my eyes with thee. Val. Thou false one! Well I know thou heed'st not longer Thy plighted faith to me. Thy bosom now Glows only for Hersilia. Acr. Mine, Valeria? Val. Acrontes, thine. Think'st thou to me unknown Thy suit in vain preferr'd, her fire's refusal, Thy rage of disappointment? Acr. O! thou wrong'st me: I call down Heaven to witnessâ Val. Oh! forbear. I would not blush at perjuries like thineâ Goâif thou heed'st not me, yet heed thyself, If me thou dost despise, despise not yet My friendly counsel: worthless as thou art, Let me not tremble to behold thy danger. Acr. Canst thou be thus alarm'd to see my danger, And yet, Valeria, think me still a traitor? Val. Yes, I'm deceiv'd; and know too well Who acts the traitor's part; Yet cannot, O ye Power's! expel His image from my heart. Yes, cruel, thus by Fate oppress'd Unheard-of woes I prove; For while the treason I detest, The traitor still I love. [Exit. SCENE VI. Acrontes alone. This meeting is ill-omen'd to my purpose: But let me still be constant. Rome shall fall: I only, with my Ceninensian bands, Prepar'd for instant action, will impel The Sabines' tardy vengeanceâBut Hersiliaâ She must be first secur'd; a hostage left Like her, might check the ardour of my soul With chilling doubts. Already have I one To guide me to herâbut as yet he comes notâ He must be sought. [going. SCENE VII. Enter Curtius. Acr. Ha! Curtius! Cur. Ha! Acrontes [meeting and gazing at each other for some time. Acr. And art thou he? Cur. And am I not deceiv'd. Acr. The sovereign of th' Antemnati in Rome? Cur. And here the Ceninensian prince? Acr. At length Impatient of your long-delay'd resentment, I gave the reins to mine. Myself, of all Our injur'd Sabines, will alone revenge The common cause. This day I mean to make The assault on Rome; and hence it first behoves To explore the weak and least defended parts: This task I trust to none but to Acrontes. O! if a zeal like mine inflame thy breast, Unite with me; suspend all former hatred. I, from this hour, expunge from my remembrance The wrong thou didst me to refuse Hersilia: Now speak we but of honour. Henceforth cease All rancour for our private injuries, Till to the universal world be shewn Our vow'd revenge for every public wrong. Cur. But know'st thou not to-day what new affront We must sustain? This day they celebrate, Between the Roman youth and Sabine maids, The hymeneal rites. The certain tidings Of this have reach'd us, and the festive shews I see on every hand confirm the truth. I cannot bear the thought: unconscious yet What course to take, I haste to snatch my daughter From these detested nuptials. Acr. Curtius, now Too late thou com'st. Cur. Say'st thou? Acr. The nuptials, prince, Already are completed. Cur. Heavenly Powers! And was Hersilia tooâIt cannot beâ Too well I know her: ever was her mind Respectful, duteous; and her life was led In due observance of her sex's laws, And firm obedience to a father's will. Acr. And yet is she a bride. Cur. Who dares affirm it?â How know'st thou this? Cur. But now, in this attire Disguis'd, and mingled with the crowd, I saw The nuptial pomp. Cur. And was Hersilia tooâ Acr. Hersilia too was there amongst the brides, The joyous brides of Rome's ferocious youth. Cur. O! cruel stroke! [sits down in an agony of rage and grief. Acr. But wherefore linger now In tardy sloth? Prevention comes too late, But vengeance still is ours. Haste then, unite Thy scatter'd warriors, and with me combine In impious Rome's destruction. Cur. [not attending to him.] O! Hersilia! The child of Curtius and a Sabine maid! Acr. He hears me notâhis madness of despair May raise some tumult, or perehance obstruct My purpos'd scheme to bear Hersilia hence: 'Twere wisdom to provide against this evil. [to Cur.] Then tell me, Curtius, may I learn from theeâ Cur. O! leave me, leave me! Acr. Must I leave thee, Curtius? Then be it soânow to my great design. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Curtius alone. And is Hersilia then indeed become A willing Roman wife? Midst all my woes This, this I little fear'd.âO! perjur'd girl! Perfidious! vainly shalt thou hope to escape Thy punishment: not earth shall yield to thee A wish'd asylum; think not e'er to find A shelter from my rage, though plac'd beside Thy new-made spouse, or in the arms of Jove! Hence thoughts of every gentle kind, Affections that my heart remind I bore a parent's name: To madness and revenge resign'd, The father I disclaim. [Exit. SCENE IX. Apartments in the palace destined for Hersilia, on the Palatine hill. Hersilia, Hostilius. Host. But dost thou know, Hersilia, all the merits That Romulus can boast? Her. I know them all. Host. And yet thou lov'st him not? Her. With us, Hostilius, Love is the child of duty. Host. Then for Rome No hope remains but from a father's mandate. Her. And that were vain to expectâI know my father. Host. If adverse thus thy sire reject our king; If coldly thou, Hersilia, canst receive him, At least thou may'st secure our nation's peace. Her. Who I? Say how. Host. The people wish to see Their king espous'd; and nearly this desire Degenerates into tumult. If the fates Deny thee to our wishes, Romulus May from thy counsel choose another bride. Her. What mean'st thou? By my counsel? Host. Yes, Hersilia. Her. But say what right have Iâ Host. That right which love Claims o'er his heart; and who shall hope to guide Like thee his soul's affection? Her. Must Hersilia Be call'd to fix the destiny of Rome? Shall I, a stranger, seek for you a queen? Host. Thou need'st not seek: behold her near. Her. Her name? Host. Valeria. Her. Ha! Valeria? Host. Since the throne Must not be honour'd with Hersilia's virtues, At least it never can receive disgrace From noble, chaste Valeria. Her. If thou think'st Hersilia can availâbut sure, Hostilius, 'Tis wondrous strangeâValeria is a lover. Host. I know it well; and for her evil fate She loves Acrontes: 'twere a deed of friendship To break such chains as ill beseem Valeria. Her. It may be soâyetâ Host. Romulus this moment In search of thee approaches. Her. Romulus! Host. Even he: support, Hersilia, my design; Use every meansâ Her. Thou would'st instruct me surely To rave like theeâWho can divine thy purpose? I till this moment deem'd thy sighs of love Breath'd for Valeria, yet thou bid'st me give Her beauties to another. Doubtless first Thou hast deceiv'd, or must deceive me now. Host. Ah! no, believe not that I once deceiv'd, Or I deceive thee now: beyond myself I love Valeria; hence my warmest wishes Pursue her honour, glory and her peace. With lying boast those lovers claim The praise to faithful lovers due; Who in the object of their flame A selfish happiness pursue. What generous passions sway his breast, What love is to his fair-one shown, Who when his power can make her blest Derives not from her bliss his own? [Exit. SCENE X. Hersilia alone. 'Tis virtue sure to second the design Of generous loveâbut pause awhile, Hersilia, And weigh the task enjoin'd. To Romulus Shall I give counsel? Make him this request? And offer him a bride?âMy heart revolts From such a thoughtâWhat words shall I employ To speakâAlas! what mean these sudden doubts That suit not Sabine honour? Whence the tumult That reigns within this bosom? SCENE XI. Enter Curtius. Cur. Have I found thee? Degenerate girl! Her. What voice is that? My father! O! sirâ Cur. Be silent; nor with lips like thine Profane that name. Her. Alas! my father. Cur. Cast Those daring eyes the earth. A Roman wife Can ne'er be Curtius' daughter. Her. Ha! a wife! A wife, Hersilia? Cur. Perjur'd as thou art, Add not a falsehood to increase thy guilt. Wert thou not now, with thy rebellious friends, Before the hated altar? Her. A spectatress, But not a bride. Cur. And was not then thy handâ Her. Hersilia's hand will never be bestow'd Without a father's sanction. Cur. Art thou thenâ Her. I am a Sabine still. Cur. An offer'd throne Will never changeâ Her. A throne to me were vile, Unless to thee I ow'd it. Cur. And the threats Of hostile rageâ Her. No other threats, my father, Could make me tremble, but the threats alone Deriv'd from thy displeasure. Death itself Were far less dreadful than the just reproach Of him to whom I owe my life, my all! Cur. Thou dearest part! thou treasure of my soul! Come to my breast: forgive my hasty rage; A happier day for me till nowâHersilia, Thou tremblest! Her. 'Tis for thee, for thee, my father, I trembleâOn the instant Romulus Is here expectedâShould'st thou now be found In this disguise, amidst a hostile city, Alas! who knowsâO! let us hence, my lord, Where'er thou goest I will pursue thy steps. Cur. No, daughter, this might hazard all, and make Our hopes abortive. We must patient wait The favour of the night. Her. MeantimeâO Heavens! Behold he comes! [looking out. Cur. I goâtake heed, my child, Thy fears betray me not. Her. Where canst thou now In safety wait? Cur. A faithful friend is near To second my design. When time shall serve Expect my quick returnâ'till then farewell! [Exit. SCENE XII. Hersilia alone. O! me unhappy! midst my adverse fortune There wanted only this, of every evil The worst, to tremble for a father's safety. In this distressful state how shall I meet The eyes of Romulus?âAlas! he comesâ Let me avoid his presence. [going. SCENE XIII. Enter Romulus. Rom. Dost thou fly me? Fly me, Hersilia? Her. [aside.] O ye Powers! assist me. Rom. Fear not, O! princess, I shall speak of love: No, I too much respect the native manners Held sacred by thy sex; yet surely these Are more than virtue claims. To curb my passion I must confess is pain; but greater pain To hazard thy displeasure. Her. [aside.] Generous prince! Rom. It will not sure be deem'd I speak of love, To say but this: if Heaven and if thy father Had given me to possess Hersilia's hand, No bliss had equall'd mine. Her. [aside.] Alas! Hersilia. Rom. Thou would'st have added splendor to the throne: In thee had Rome beheld her guardian goddess, And I the unrivall'd sovereign of my heart. Her. My lordâno moreâpermit me to retire. Rom. Am I then hateful to thee? Her. [aside.] Cruel fate! Rom. If with the Sabines 'tis a crime to love, Yet sure your laws compel you not to hate; And 'twixt such adverse passions souls like yours May rest uncensur'd; and though Heaven forbids me To find in thee a lover and a wife, Hersilia may be yet a grateful friend. Her. [aside.] Where am I?âCruel Powers! shall I depart, Or still remain? How fain I would excuse My seeming rigourâbut I dare not speak, And every accent that I strive to utter Converts between my lips to broken sighs. Rom. Is still Hersilia silent? Will she not Vouchsafe me one poor look? Ah! tell me when I have offended? Say, what crime is mine? Her. Sirâif you thinkâ[aside.] O Heaven! Rom. Why dost thou pause? Some new distressâfor never till this hour Thy heart has struggled with such varied passion. Thou blushest now, and now thy cheek is pale: It seems thou fain would'st tell what yet thy tongue In vain would speak, while every look confesses A bosom tortur'd with conflicting pangs. In pity sayâ Her. O sir! I cannot speak. [weeps. Rom. Alas! what mean those tears that flow From sorrows of the heart? Her. Ah me! I dieâbut dare not now The pangs I feel impart. Rom. Am I then guilty of thy grief? Her. I wouldâfarewell. Rom. And wherefore go? Her. My stay to neither yields relief. Rom. Yet leave me not, Hersilia, so. Both. Ah! who like me by fate oppress'd, E'er knew such cruel pain? I ne'er till now, howe'er distress'd, Have known such passions rend my breast As I this day sustain. [Exeunt severally. END OF THE FIRST ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An inner apartment of the palace, from which is a view of the Porta Carmentalis, and the Tarpeian Rock. Hersilia alone. Alas! 'tis all too true, and nought avails Still to conceal this weakness from myself. I am no longer now the austere Hersilia; The first of every thought is Romulus: Unconscious what I say, his name for ever Dwells on my lips. If any, if my presence, But speak of Romulus, I feel the glow Of mantling blushes: oft as he approaches, I am disturb'd, the colour leaves my cheek: I'm silent, I'm confus'd; while in my breast, My heart beats quick with mingled grief and joy, If this be not, ah! tell me what is love? Since thou so ill canst guard thee from the foe, Contend no more, Hersiliaâfly, O! fly; And save at least thy glory by thy flight, For flight in love is victory. SCENE II. Enter Curtius. Cur. My daughterâ Hersilia. Her. Ah! my father, let us hence Without delayâif now thou com'st to seek me, Behold I am prepar'd. Cur. I come, my child, To warn thee of a danger unforeseen, That threatens thee. The Ceninensian prince Is now in Rome: with him I have convers'd, He feign'd to quit the city: but this instant, Near thy apartment, from afar again I saw the insidious prince: he doubtless plans Some dark design: but late he sought thy hand. At my refusal fir'd, he gives the reins To mad resentment, bending all his thoughts To outward violence and fraud. Take heed. Her. Ah! then, what longer should detain us here? Let us depart. Cur. It is not yet the time, But rest in peace a few short moments more. Her. In Rome, alas! there is no peace for me. I cannot bear this dwelling: take me, father, Take me from all I suffer: let me fly From every object here; and breathe at length The tranquil Sabine air. Cur. My dearest daughter, How am I charm'd to hear thy fond impatience, In which the Sabine virtue brightly shines. Be calm: ere long expect me to return, And give thee freedom. Let this thought meanwhile Console thee, that thou may'st with conscious pride Review thyself. Let every daughter learn From thee, my dear Hersilia, to respect Her country and her father; triumph o'er Th' enfeebling perils of her sex and youth, And, midst the flatteries of insidious love, Preserve the free dominion o'er her heart: My hope! my glory! and my best support! When, I, ye Gods! to thought recall That such a daughter's mine; Whate'er may chance, I pardon all, Nor more at Heaven repine. On me let adverse Fortune frown, And woes on woes increase; That dear remembrance still shall crown A father's days with peace. [Exit. SCENE III. Hersilia alone. Where shall I hide myself? These praises given, So ill deserv'd, are to my soul reproaches. And shall a father prize in thee, Hersilia, That virtue which thou hast not? Shall he thus Deceiv'd, applaud thee, love thee, honour thee, This canst thou hear, and not with shame expire? Does not thy conscience shrink from such approval, Or feel a generous impulse to deserve it? It shall be soâand flying shall secure thee.â But in the sight of Romulus, O! Heaven! I dare not trust myselfâby proof I know How cruel is the trial.âThen in me Is love necessity. [she sits.] To me alone Has Heaven denied the liberty of choice? Ah! noâresume, to guide the stubborn passions, Those reins, Hersilia, thou hast thrown aside: A firm determin'd virtue conquers all. My fears are vanish'd now: the greater trial, The greater is my triumph; I abjure The affections I condemn. Henceforth Hersilia Decrees to be the mistress of her will. Now, where is Romulus? Hostilius, say. [rises with firmness. SCENE IV. Enter Hostilius. Host. He comes this instant from the senate house, And hastes to his apartment. Her. May Hersilia Have leave to see him? Host. Leave to see him, princess? Forgive me, but such doubt were most unjust. Her. I would converse with him. Host. Then Rome perhaps May cherish hopes propitious to her vows, And Romulus most welcome to his love. Her. Hersilia was not born for him or Rome. But if, as thou hast said, indeed 'tis true, The will of Romulus depends on mine; This day shall thy Valeria be a queen. Host. Ah! thenâ SCENE V. Enter Valeria. Her. [to Val.] My friend, if happy stars assist, I go to obtain for thee a regal crown. Val. For me! Her. For thee: but think not mine the merit Of such a choice: I owe to good Hostilius The generous thought: in thee has he propos'd A consort worthy of the king of Rome. With reason I approve, and now aspire, In such a work, to emulate his praise. Val. Believe me grateful: but you both dispose Of that for me, which is not mine to give. My love, you know, is plighted to a lover: Though faithless I am his, and love becomes In me necessity. Her. The fond pretence To excuse our weakness. Let us use our will To better purpose; or, if we refuse To break those ties, which love has render'd dear, Accuse not Fate for errors all our own. Let none against his stars exclaim, Or midst his sufferings Fortune blame, Who still a willing slave remains. Of what avail are tears and sighs To his relief, who only tries To find his pleasure in his chains? [Exit. SCENE VI. Hostilius, Valeria. Val. What can this mean, Hostilius? I believ'd Hersilia's love for Romulus; but now, By proof, I find my error. Once I deem'd In thy affections I had borne a part; But now I find thou didst but mock my ear With flattery feigning love. I own, Hostilius, I know not what to think. Host. If you have err'd In deeming love had touch'd Hersilia's heart, I cannot well divine; but this I know, I love Valeria with the tenderest passion, And ever will preserve for her my flame. Val. Then wherefore seek in me your future queen? Host. In what does your advancement to the throne Oppose my love? The passion that I feel, Is far, far different in its purity From that of vulgar lovers. Ever still The admirer of your virtues, jealous ever Of all that may advance Valeria's honour, Exulting in her fortune, I shall still Through life adore her, as I now adore. Val. Ah! peace, Hostilius, spare me the remorse My heart must feel to be to thee ungrateful. What lover e'er could boast a love like thine? Ah! learn at least that well I know thee now; And were the ties, in which, alas! I languish, Less hard to be dissolv'd, the noble gift Of such a heart as thine, in my ambition Would far outshine the splendors of a throne. When first a lover I became A lover's sighs to prove, Why did I feed another flame, And sigh not for thy love? Ah! why so little does the mind Its first affections know, That where we deem our bliss to find Too oft we find our woe? [Exit. SCENE VII. Hostilius alone. O! Heaven, I'm not deceiv'd. Valeria now Is more than grateful to me. My affection In all its purity, to that dear breast Is not a stranger. O! the certainty Of such a bliss! What rapture do I feel! In this excess of joy, my soul must own No greater recompense awaits on love. If one there be who little knows The bliss that now my soul o'erflows, He well may pity claim: And surely brief his joys must prove, Who never knew such thoughts as move My panting heart, since gentle Love Here kindled first his flame. [Exit. SCENE VIII. Apartments, with covered walks on the side of the Palatine hill. Romulus alone. O! noâ'tis not alone the Sabine rigour That agitates Hersilia. In that face And from those lips methought I saw, I heardâ Ah! Romulus, begirt with threatening foes, Amidst a growing empire's many cares, How has thy bosom found a place for love? Such weaknessâSurely 'tis not always weakness, When love with reason joins; it changes then Its former nature. My Hersilia shines The friendly star that regulates my thoughts With more than mortal influence. Yes, her virtue, The ancient splendor of her ancestry, The welfare of the realm, the people's suffrageâ But hark! what clash of swords is this I hear? What means the sudden tumult? [looking out. Acr. [within.] Noâthis weapon Is not an easy conquest. Rom. How? My guards In conflict with a Roman? SCENE IX. Enter Acrontes. Acr. Adverse Gods! [dropping his sword as he enters. Rom. Forbear, my friends, and touch not him, who now Has no defence.âYe Powers! Am I deceiv'd? Thou art not sure Acrontes? Acr. I am he. [haughtily. Rom. Acrontes and in Rome? In my apartments? In Roman vestments? What is thy design? Acr. Of this I render no account to thee. Rom. Thy boldness suits but ill the present time: Remember now Acrontes where thou art. Acr. Where'er Acrontes is, with him he bears His valour still. Rom. But, prince, such valour here In thee were rashness. Speak: is it the love Thou vainly bear'st Hersilia, or the hatred Long nourish'd against me, that blinds thy reason? Acr. Spare, Romulus, thy questions: know I come not To answer at thy bidding: use thy fortune. I stand determin'd and prepar'd for all: I know what treatment I decreed for thee, Had now that state been thine, to which the fates (Adverse to valour) have reduc'd Acrontes: And hence I know what to expect from thee. Rom. Thou dost but ill presage.âLictors, return His weapon to the Ceninensian prince; And you, ye warriors, give him conduct safe Beyond the precincts of the Roman walls. Acr. My sword! Rom. Receive it, and in yonder field Regain, with this, what thou hast lost in Rome. Acr. Thy folly, Romulus, may cost thee dear: Revenge, for ostentation thus neglected, Too late thou wilt repent. Rom. Revenge? On whom? If thou'rt a madman, I forgive thy frenzy: If thou'rt a lover, thou hast then my pity; A foe, I heed thee not; and if thou com'st A traitor, vers'd in treason, I despise thee. Acr. Contemn me now with haughty speech, This arm perhaps ere long may teach Thy tongue an humbler strain. Then see if still thy pride will dare From yonder Capitol afar, As here at Rome, in fields of war To insult me once again. [Exit. SCENE X. Enter Hersilia. Her. [entering.] Behold himâTo complete my victory The time now calls upon me. Rom. [to himself.] Wondrous strange Such courage and such fierceness! Her. [to herself.] Gods! what means This new enchantment? In his presence now I feel again disturb'd. Rom. [to himself.] And can it be, Such valour should be found to inspire a soul Where dwells so little virtue? Her. [to herself.] No, Hersilia, Let not thy throbbing heart disarm thy purpose: The boldest warrior finds in every conflict, The hardest trial in the first encounter. [advancing to Rom.] My lord, vouchsafe but for a few short moments To give me audience. Rom. Is it possible! Do I not dream? The dearest of my cares, My only wish, the fair Hersilia comes, And comes, ye Powers! to seek me. Her. Romulus, Wilt thou not hear me then? [with a serious air. Rom. What means Hersilia? Her. Thou know'st such words offend me. [serious. Rom. In despite Of all my best resolves my heart will rise Spontaneous to my lips. Her. If thou would'st have Me present still, speak not in tender accents, Nor ever say thou lov'st me. Rom. [aside.] Surely yet She hates me notâ[to her.] I shall obeyâWhat would'st thou? Her. I come from Romulus to implore a grace. Rom. A grace from me! And must thou yet be told, That from the moment I beheld thee first, Thou hadst dominion o'er my heart and throne; O'er allâforgive meâI will curb my fondness, And never more transgress. Her. [aside.] Be firm, Hersilia, And urge him to receive Valeria's hand. Rom. What would Hersilia? Speak. Her. That Romulus Would deign from me to accept another bride. Rom. I?âI, Hersilia? [with surprise. Her. YesâI offer thee My friend Valeria. Rom. Me! [disturbed. Her. Thou know'st Valeria Deserves to share thy heart. Rom. And dost thou thus, Ingrate, insult my love? Does then my faith, My candid truth and constancy deserve This recompense? And canst thou, cruel, thus Distract a heart that bears thy image grav'd; Where, cruel as thou art, thou still shalt reign? Her. [aside.] Ye rigid Sabine laws! support me still. Rom. Give me another bride! Almighty Powers! Could not thy cold indifference then suffice? To heap contempt and anguish on the man Who lives not but in thee! Her. [aside.] My breaking heart! Rom. Insensate as I was! I fondly deem'd My love return'd by thine: those broken accents, Those changing looks, involuntary tears, That seem'd to speak some passion ill conceal'd; And these, Hersilia, were deception all! [tenderly. Her. Ah! these were no deception. [tenderly. Rom. How, Hersilia! And was I not deceiv'd? [with pleasing surprise. Her. [aside.] Eternal Powers! What have I said? Rom. Thou treasure of my soul! [with warmth of affection. Is it then true? And have I then thy love? Her. O! holdânor triumph o'er Hersilia's weakness. Rom. But could'st thou, loving Romulus, propose To him another bride? Her. O! Heavenly Powers! No more distract meâCould'st thou read my heart, Ah! didst thou know how much it felt to make The harsh proposal, (unavailing effort Of tyrant duty!) which to thee appear'd A woman's cruel insult: should I tell thee What dreadful conflict of contending passions Has rent my soulâAh! Romulus, 'twould raise Thy pity and thy wonder. Rom. Rather say My tenderness and love. What mortal ever Was blest like me? The ador'd Hersilia's mine! Behold the star to bless my growing empire! O! happy Rome! Her. Alas! it cannot be. Vain is that hopeâa hope that must deceive thee: I never can be thine. Rom. Not mine, Hersilia! Say, what forbids it now? Her. I am a daughter. Let this suffice; by thee subdued, My rigour now is o'er: By thee my inmost heart is view'd; But ah! exact no more. Still constant shall my soul remain Her duty to fulfil; Though every effort prov'd in vain Her weakness to conceal. [Exit. SCENE XI. Romulus alone. Ah! Romulus, no longer doubt thy triumph; Thou hast conquer'd all Hersilia's rigid coldness: Her father shall forget his enmity, And yield at length consent. Entreaties, offers, With every 'vantage; nothing shall be left Untried to gain him. SCENE XII. Enter Hostilius hastily. Host. Romulus, to arms! Rom. What means Hostilius, ha! Host. Rome is in danger. Acrontes, mindless of thy generous treatment, Had scarcely gain'd his freedom when he threaten'd, With all his force conjoin'd, to assail the city. Rom. What force is his? Host. His Ceninensian bands. All these in ambush did he hold prepar'd In various quarters: at his signal given I saw the neighbouring country fill'd with arms; A thousand unexpected weapons blaze, And open'd banners streaming to the wind. Rom. The insensate thinks to find us unprepar'd: His punishment shall teach him other thoughts. [going. Host. I at thy sideâ [preparing to follow. Rom. No: here remain, Hostilius: Rome I intrust to thee. Defend thy country; Defend Hersilia: who can tell what next The traitor may attempt? Some secret guile, As yet to act, perhaps remains behind. Go, but delay not. Host. On my faith repose. [Exit. SCENE XIII. Romulus alone. All thanks to thee, O God of arms! to thee, Mother of mighty Love! from whom my blood Derives its deathless source. My happiness Is all your gift, and yours the noble warmth That now my bosom feels: in every trial Be near me still, and let your favouring presence For me still open every path to fame. Amidst the toils of arms I go A double wreath to find; And with the amorous myrtle show The martial laurel twin'd. A victor and a lover blest, Shall I returning home, With either conquest proudly grac'd, Triumphant enter Rome. [Exit. END OF THE SECOND ACT.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. A wild part of the Palatine gardens, amongst high craggy rocks, watered by a falling stream, and shaded with a number of thick trees. Enter Curtius in haste. Where shall I find her? Let me not neglect The prosperous moment Fortune offers nowâ Behold she comes. SCENE II. Enter Hersilia. My dearest daughter, thanks To all the Gods! at length we may depart; The time is now arriv'd. Her. Alas! you know not A dreadful battle rages now between The Romans and the Ceninensian bands Behind the Palatine: the quarter there Is throng'd with arms and men, and every way Barr'd from access to reach the Sabine land. Cur. Not all are barr'd. Her. Yes, doubt it not, my father: I from my lofty dwelling view'd beneath The furious combatants; and from the sight With terror flyingâ Cur. What thy fear has form'd An obstacle to our intended flight, But makes it easier. Rome, in tumult now, Pours all her numbers to the threaten'd hill, While, on the other side, Tarpeia's rock Is left deserted. Well thou know'st the Tiber Runs at its foot: while on the side oppos'd The combat still continues, we on this May pass the stream: the further bank presents Etruria's friendly land; securely thence We to our native country may return. Her. Behold me ready to attend your steps. Cur. No: here I leave with thee a trusty guide; With him depart. My followers, now conceal'd, Collected first, I'll join thee on the way: Nought can remain to frustrate our designs. Behold the sun is reddening in the west: We, unobserv'd, may safely go from Rome; And where the river bathes Carmenta's gate A bark will then expect us. Her. [aside.] Cruel parting! Cur. Thou tremblest stillâfear not, confide in me; I've weigh'd it all, Hersilia, and remov'd Whate'er might thwart our purpose: calm once more Thy troubled bosom: liberty is near. He breathes again, who sees once more The long'd-for he left before; Who ne'er again to view the shore Had hop'd his wish'd return. When past the gloom of dreary night, We deem, an object dear to sight, The early beam of dawning light, That tells the approach of morn. [Exit. SCENE III. Hersilia alone. O! Tiber! Rome! and O! delightful shores On which I breath'd my earliest sighs of love, I now forsake you; but with you I leave My heart's far dearer part! How oft your name Will to my lips return! How oft my thoughts Haunt the dear paths of those frequented hills! Unblest Hersilia! never was a state, A destiny so cruelâYes, I know The soul of Romulus; and he, like him To whom all, all he hop'd has Heaven denied, Must feel an anguish that surpasses mine. âCould I, ere yet I go, at least but learnâ SCENE IV. Enter Valeria. Valeria, tell meâif thou know'stâO! tell me The fortune of the fight; nor let me longer Remain in anxious doubt. Val. The fight is ended. Her. And who has conquer'd? Val. Romulus had first Obtain'd the palm. Her. But now? Val. 'Tis yet unknown Whose brows the last decisive wreath will crown. Her. Alas! what means Valeria? Val. Patient hear, Thou shalt know all. Her. Speak then. Val. The battle's fate Seem'd near determin'd, and on every side The foes, with broken ranks, no longer fac'd The Roman swords: a thousand signs declar'd Their courage lost; and falling, as they fled They crush'd each other with promiscuous slaughter; When fierce Acrontes, bearing in his looks The rage of furies, 'midst the wounded steeds And gasping warriors, breaking through the tide Of fugitives, and trampling under foot The dead and dying, clear'd his desperate way, And call'd from far on Romulus by name; Then join'd him soon, and with insensate boldness Defied the victor to a single trial. Her. O! rashness!âWhat ensued? Val. Our hero then Disdaining all advantage, with a glance Bade every warrior cease to wield his arms. The battle paus'd; an ample space was left: Alone, with look sedate, he then advanc'd To meet the foe and answer to his challenge. Her. What follow'd then? Val. Of that I know not yet. When he, from whom I learn'd what I've imparted, Had left the field the victory was doubtful. SCENE V. Enter Hostilius. Host. 'Tis so no longerâRomulus has conquer'd. Her. Is it then true? Host. Thyself shalt soon behold The first rich trophies, borne by solemn vow, In triumph offer'd to the king of Gods. Val. The trophies!âHeaven! Acrontes thenâ Host. By proof Acrontes shew'd how blinded rage must yield To art and valour. All-athirst for blood, He struck at random, heedless of defence, While Romulus stood wisely on his guard, And let the madman waste his strength in vain. When now he saw him panting, and perceiv'd His blows less fierce and frequent, close he press'd Th' enfeebled foe; who yielding to the shock, Retreated slowly, trembled, reel'd and fell; And falling, lost his sword: to him serene The victor hasted, rais'd him from the ground, And gave him back his weapon. Her. Generous prince! Host. And soon forgetting enmity, he thought To clasp him to his bosom, when he saw At him Acrontes aim a treacherous blow: Then rous'd to wrath, all terrible he rush'd Upon the traitor, drove the conquering steel, As yet unstain'd with his perfidious blood, Deep through his breast, and lifeless left the foe. Val. O! help me or I faint! [sinks down. Her. Valeria, now Exert thy fortitudeâA stroke like thisâ âO Heaven! my father waits me. [aside.] Thou, Hostilius, Watch o'er a hapless maiden. Give, my friend, From thee another proof of generous love: This pious office well becomes Hostilius. The gush of sudden grief forgive, Since love to thee is known: Nor let the fair unpitied live For sorrows like thy own. If she must ever hope in vain To see her peace return; Yet let her now at least obtain The liberty to mourn. [Exit. SCENE VI. Valeria, Hostilius. Host. Ador'd Valeria! suffer me to own I envy him his fate, who thus receives The glorious tribute of such precious tears. Val. Hostilius, go: too much I feel my shame To view in thee such witness of my weakness. Host. Thy will to me is law; but know, Valeria, I blame not thy distress, and should I speak My secret soul, perhaps a firmer heart Would charm me less, than softness such as thine. Amidst those pearly drops of woe That trickling down thy features flow, Through which thine eyes more lovely show Thy tender heart appears. The charms of that enchanting face, Where pity blends a softening grace, More powerful seem in tears. [Exit. SCENE VII. Valeria alone. Whom dost thou mourn, Valeria? Ah! this grief Makes thee partaker in another's guilt. [rises. Call, call to mind the errors of Acrontes, And call to mind thy wrongsâAwake thy virtue; Forget an impiousâO ye Powers! to shed Oblivion o'er a passion long indulg'd, Demands full many a pang of lingering sorrow! One instant may the affections bind In love's resistless power; But not one instant can the mind To liberty restore. The bird, though 'scap'd the vicious snare, The clammy juice retains: So feeble Virtue long will wear Her customary chains. [Exit. SCENE VIII. A spacious part at the foot of the Palatine hill, decorated for the nuptials with the Sabine dames. A magnificent flight of steps ascending to the palace of Romulus, situated on the hill. A numerous crowd of people assembled to welcome the return of the victor. Romulus enters crowned with laurel, preceded by the Lictors and the Sabine prisoners, with the trophies of slain Acrontes, followed by his victorious army. Chorus. Our hero's glory to sustain, Ye Gods! your favour show: O! teach him every art to reign, And triumph o'er the foe. Still thrive the laurel that may frame The wreaths his brow shall wear, And ever his victorious name Let earth and seas declare. Rom. O Rome! in conquest learn to read The future will of Fate; What honour'd paths thy sons may lead To exalt the Roman state. If some the soul with knowledge fire; To stars their titles give; Bid figur'd bronze with life respire, And sculptur'd marble live: For thee by friendly Fate design'd Shall Tiber laws proclaim, To exalt the lowly of mankind, And haughty nations tame. Chorus. Our hero's glory to sustain, Ye Gods! your favour show: O! teach him every art to reign And triumph o'er the foe. Rom. O! Rome, in conquering, learn to read The future will of Fateâ SCENE IX. Enter Valeria in haste. Val. O! help, my gracious lord! thy presence now Is needful to usâwe have foes in Rome. Rom. Ha! foes in Rome? Val. Alas! 'tis true. Rom. Say, where? Val. Towards Carmentas' gate are all in arms: Some thither run, while some with terror fly; And every moment wider spreads the tumult. Rom. Follow me, Romans. SCENE X. Enter Hostilius. Host. All is now at peace, Reserve your valour for a nobler cause. [to Rom. Rom. What causeâ Host. Would'st thou believe it, Romulus? One has but now been found to make the attempt To bear Hersilia hence. Rom. But how, enclos'd Within the city, could the ravisher E'er hope to escape? Host. Already had he brib'd The guards that watch'd the gates, but could not thus Deceive my vigilance; my charge was given The centinels should take their post by turns; And hence they never long remain'd the same. The traitor, coming with Hersilia, found The pass defended, which he strove to force. His followers all, though fiercely bent on conquest, Were slain, and he himself remain'd a prisoner. Val. O! wondrous daring! Rom. And Hersilia thenâ Host. Hersilia panting then and wild with terrorâ SCENE XI. Enter Hersilia. Her. Ah! Romulus, have pityâmercy! pardon! [goes to kneel to Rom. Rom. O! princess, rise [prevents her.] What would'st thou? Calm thy terror, Thou art now in safety here. Her. Preserve my father: Preserve him from the soldier's insolence; Preserve him from the people's rage. Rom. Thy father? Host. O! Heaven! was he who held thy hand, whose valour I mark'd with wonder in the fight, was heâ Her. He is my father. Rom. Say Hostilius, then What has befallen him? Host. He remains a prisoner. I deem'd it prudent to secure in him The means of more discovery; while his aspect And valour claim'd respect Rom. But where is now The prince dispos'd? Host. I left him 'midst the guard. Rom. Conduct him instant hither. Host. Seeâhe's here. SCENE LAST. Enter Curtius guarded. Rom. O! valiant prince! and must our enmity For ever last? Shall daily cause of strife Divide too warlike nations, form'd by Heaven To rule the subject world? Here end at length Our mutual hatred. To its place restor'd, Return thy honour'd weapon: thou art free, For Romulus has now no claim on Curtius. Cur. [aside.] What unexpected words are these I hear? Rom. Thou answer'st not, O! prince! Her. [aside.] Alas! my father Remains implacable. Rom. Ah! since thy power, With such a gift as Heaven on thee bestow'd, Can happiness confer; neglect not now The blest occasion. Should'st thou grant to me Hersilia's hand, what treasure would be mine, Mine by thy goodness! Ask me then whate'er A grateful heart can pay: thyself prescribe The laws to bind our friendship; Curtius, then Direct my future fate. Cur. [aside.] O! mighty Gods! Why was not Romulus a Sabine born? Her. [aside.] Alas! he still is silent. Rom. Speak, Hersilia. Her. O! Heaven! What can I say? I am a daughter; I know my father's will, and this to obey I need not tell thee is my first of duties. Rom. My fate is then decided; since no less His silence, than thy speech, declares his purpose. Ah! Curtius! every hope I see is vain To shake thy constancy. Though nought avails To conquer Curtius, still to me remains The conquest o'er myself. Go hence in freedom, And bear thy daughter to her native land. Cur. And dost thou then restore Hersilia to me? Rom. I do. Cur. O Gods! Rom. A lover and belov'd, A conqueror, I restore her to thy arms. Cur. [aside.] O! virtue more than human! Rom. O! farewell! [to Her. Farewell my only joy! Heaven still preserve thee Thy sex's pride, thy noble father's honour, My soul's fond worship and the world's example. Her. [aside.] Support me, Heaven! Cur. [aside.] And who can hate this Roman? Rom. Yet speak, O! prince, at least vouchsafe a look Ere yet we part; and since thou will not own A father's name, yet deign to part a friend, And let our former enmity subside. Cur. Enough, enough, my son, Hersilia's thine; Thou hast conquer'd. Rom. Do I dream? Her. Can this be true? Cur. I have not in this bosom, O! my children, A heart of flint. Who loves not Romulus That knows his virtues? Love him, my Hersilia, I love him too, adore him, and am thankful To Heaven that sav'd me for so blest a day. Rom. O! happy Rome! Her. My father and my husband! Chorus. Ye Gods! whose power directs below Th' events of mortal men; By whom their fortunes mingled flow, The cloudy and serene. Propitious days by you be given To bless this faithful pair; Since nuptial chains for these in Heaven Were fram'd beneath your care. END OF THE THIRD ACT.</field>
