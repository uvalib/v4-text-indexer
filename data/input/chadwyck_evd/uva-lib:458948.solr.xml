      <field name="fulltext">THE LOVERS PROGRES.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus primus. Scæna prima Enter Leon and Malfort. Malfort. And as I told you Sir. Leon. I understand you, Clarinda's still perverse. Malf. Shee's worse, obdurate, Flinty relentlesse, my love-passions jeer'd at, My presents scorn'd. Leon. 'Tis strange a waiting-woman, In her condition apt to yield, should hold out, A man of your place, reverend beard and shape, Besieging her. Mal. You might adde too my wealth, Which she contemnes, five hundred Crowns per annum, For which I have ventur'd hard, my conscience knows it, Not thought upon, though offer'd for a Joyinture: This Chaine, which my Lords Pesants worship, flouted; My solemne hums and ha's, the servants quake at, No Rhetorick with her; every houre she hangs out Some new flag of defiance to torment me: Last Lent my Lady cal'd me her poor John, But now I am growne a walking Skelliton, You may see through and through me. Leon. Indeed you are much falne away. Malf. I am a kinde of nothing, As she hath made me: love's a terrible glister, And if some Cordiall of her favours help not, I shall like an Italian dye backward, And breath my last the wrong way. Leo. As I live you have my pity; but this is cold comfort, And in a friend lip-physick; and now I think on't, I should doe more, and will, so you deny not Your selfe the meanes of comfort. Malf. Ile be hang'd first: one dram of't I beseech you. Leo. You are not jealous of any mans accesse to her? Mal. I would not receive the Dor, but as a bosome friend You shall direct me, still provided that I understand who is the man, and what His purpose that pleads for me. Leon. By all meanes. First, for the undertaker I am he: The meanes that I will practise, thus— Mal. Pray you forward, Leon. You know your Lady chaste Caliste loves her. Malf. Too well, that makes her proud. Leon. Nay, give me leave. This beauteous Lady, I may stile her so, (Being the paragon of France for feature) Is not alone contented in her selfe To seeem, and be good, but desires to make All such as have dependance on her like her; For this Clarinda's liberty is restrain'd; And though her kinsman the gate's shut against me; Now if you please to make your selfe the doore, For my conveyance to her, though you run The hazard of a check for't, 'tis no matter. Malf. It being for mine owne ends. Leo. Ile give it o're, If that you make the least doubt otherwise: Studying upon't? good morrow. Malf. Pray you stay sir; You are my friend: yet as the Proverb saies, When love puts in, friendship is gone: suppose You should your selfe affect her? Leon. Do you think Ile commit Incest; for it is no lesse, She being my cousin Germane. Fare you well sir. Malf. I had forgot that; for this once forgive me. Onely to ease the throbbing of my heart, (For I doe feele strange pangs) instruct me what You will say for me. Leon. First, Ile tell her that She hath so far besotted you, that you have Almost forgot to cast accompt. Malf. Meere truth sir. Leon. That of a wise and provident Steward, You are turn'd starke Asse. Malf. Urge that point home, I am so. Leon. That you adore the ground she treads upon, And kisse her foot-steps. Mal. As I doe when I finde their print in the Snow. Leon. A loving foole I know it, By your bloudlesse-frosty lips: then having related How much you suffer for her, and how well You doe deserve it— Malf. How? to suffer? Leon. No sir, to have your love return'd. Malf. That's good, I thank you. Leon. I will deliver her an Inventorie Of your good parts: as this your precious nose, Dropping affection: your high-forehead, reaching Almost to the crowne of your head; your slender waste, And a back not like a threshers, but a bending And Court-like back, and so forth, for your body. But when I touch your minde, for that must take her, (Since your out-side promises little) Ile enlarge it, (Though ne're so narrow) as your Arts to thrive, Your composition with the Cook, and Butler, Fory Coney-skins and Chippings, and halfe a share With all the under-officers of the house, In strangers bounties, that she shall have all, And you as 'twere her Bailiffe. Malf. As I will be. Leon. As you shall, so Ile promise. Then your qualities. As playing on a Gytterne, or a Jewes Trumpe. Malf. A little too on the Viall. Leon. Feare you nothing. Then singing her asleep with curious catches Of your owne making: for as I have heard, You are Poeticall. Mal. Something given that way. Yet my works seldome thrive: and the main reason The Poets urge for't, is, because I am not As poore as they are. Leon. Very likely: fetch her, While I am in the vaine. Mal. 'Tis an apt time, my Lady being at her prayers. Leon. Let her pray on. Nay goe, and if upon my intercession She doe you not some favour, Ile disclaime her; Ile ruminate on't the while. Malf. A hundred Crownes is your reward. Leo. Without 'em—nay, no trifling. Ex. Malf. That this dull clod of ignorance should know How to get money, yet want eyes to see How grossely hee's abus'd, and wrought upon, When he should make his will, the rogues turn'd rampant, As he had renew'd his youth: A handsome wench Love one a spittle-whore would run away from? Well Master Steward, I will plead for you In such a Method, as it shall appeare You are fit to be a propertie. Enter Malfort and Clarinda. Mal. Yonder he walks That knowes my worth and value, though you scorn it. Clar. If my Lady know not this— Mal. Ile answer it: If you were a Nun, I hope your cousin German Might talke with you through a grate, but you are none, And therefore may come closer: ne're hang off, As I live you shall bill: you may salute as strangers, Custome allowes it. Now, now, come upon her With all your Oratory, tickle her to the quick, As a young advocate should, and leave no vertue Of mine unmentioned, Ile stand Centinell; Nay keep the doore my selfe. Exit. Clar. How have you work'd This piece of motley to your ends? Leon. Of that at leasure, Mistris. Kissing. Clar. Lower, you are too loud, Though the fool be deaf, some of the house may hear you. Leon. Suppose they should, I am a gentleman, And held your kinseman, under that I hope I may be free. Clar. I grant it, but with caution; But be not seen to talke with me familiarly, But at fit distance, or not seen at all, It were the better: you know my Ladies humour, Shee is all honour, and compos'd of goodnesse, (As she pretends) and you having no businesse, How jealous may she grow? Leon. I will be rul'd. But you have promis'd, and I must enjoy you. Clar. We shall finde time for that; you are too hastie: Make your selfe fit, and I shall make occasion, Deliberation makes best in that businesse, And contents every way. Leon. But yon must feed This foolish Steward with some shadow of A future favour, that we may preserve him To be our instrument. Clar. Hang him. Leon. For my sake sweet, I undertook to speak for him, any bauble, Or slight employment in the way of service, Will feed him fat. Clar. Leave him to me, Enter Malfort. Malf. She comes. My Lady. Clar. I will satisfie her. Mal. How far have you prevail'd? Leon. Observe. Clar. Mounsieur Malfort. I must be briefe, my cousin hath spoke much In your behalfe, and to give you some proof, I entertaine you as my servant, You shall have the grace. Leon. Upon your knee receive it, Clar. And take it a speciall favour from me, To tye my shooe. Malf. I am ore-joy'd. Leon. Good reason. Clar. You may come higher in time. Leon. No more, the Lady. Enter Calista. Malf. She frownes. Clar. I thanke you for this visit cousin, But without leave hereafter from my Lady, I dare not change discourse with you. Malf. Pray you take your mornings draught. Leon. I thank you: Happinesse attend your honour. Exeunt Leon. Malfort. Calist. Who gave warrant to this private parle? Clar. My innocence; I hope My conference with a kinseman cannot call Your anger on me. Calist. Kinsman? Let me have No more of this, as you desire you may continue mine. Clar. Why Madam (under pardon) Suppose him otherwise: yet comming in A lawfull way it is excusable. Calist. How's this? Clar. I grant you are made of purenesse, And that your tendernesse of honour holds The soveraigntie o're your passions. Yet you have A noble Husband, with allow'd embraces, To quench lascivious fires, should such flame in you, As I must ne're believe. Were I the wife Of one that could but zanie brave Cleander, Even in his least perfections, (excuse My ore-bold inference) I should desire To meet no other object. Cal. You grow saucie. Doe I look further? Clar. No, deare Madam: and It is my wonder or astonishment rather, You could deny the service of Lisandar; A man without a rivall: one the King And Kingdome gazes on with admiration, For all the excellencies a mother could Wish in her onely sonne. Cal. Did not mine honour And Obligation to Cleander, force me To be deafe to his complaints? Clar. 'Tis true; but yet Your rigor to command him from your presence, Argu'd but small compassion; the Groves Witnesse his grievous sufferings, your faire name Upon the rhinde of every gentle Poplar, And amorous Myrtle, (trees to Venus sacred) With adoration carv'd, and kneel'd unto, This you (unseen of him) both saw and heard Without compassion, and what receiv'd he For his true sorrowes? but the heavy knowledge, That 'twas your peremptory will and pleasure, (How e're my Lord liv'd in him) he should quit Your sight and house for ever. Cal. I confesse I gave him a strong potion to worke Upon his hot bloud, and I hope 'twill cure him: Yet I could wish the cause had concern'd others, I might have met his sorrowes with more pittie; At least have lent some counsell to his miseries, Though now for honour sake, I must forget him, And never know the name more of Lisander: Yet in my justice I am bound to grant him, (Laying his love aside) most truely noble. But mention him no more, this instant houre My brother Lidian, new return'd from travaile, And his brave friend Clarange long since rivalls For faire and rich Olinda, are to heare Her absolute determination, whom She pleases to elect: see all things ready To entertain 'em: and on my displeasure No more words of Lisander. Clar. She endures to heare him nam'd by no tongue but her owne: How e're she carries it, I know she loves him. Exit. Cal. Hard nature: hard condition of poore women! That where we are most su'd too, we must flye most. The trees grow up, and mixe together freely, The Oke not envious of the sailing Cedart The lustie Vine not jealous of the Ivie Because she clips the Elme; the flowers shoot up, And wantonly kisse one another hourely, This blossome glorying in the others beauty, And yet they smell as sweet, and look as lovely: But we are ty'd to grow alone. O honour, Thou hard Law to our lives, chaine to our freedomes; He that invented thee had many curses; How is my soule divided? O Cleander, My best deserving husband! O Lisander! The truest lover that e're sacrific'd To Cupid against Hymen: O mine honour; A Tyrant, yet to be obey'd, and 'tis But justice we should thy strict Lawes endure, Since our obedience to thee keeps us pure. Exit. Enter Cleander, Lidian, and Clarange. Clean. How insupportable the difference Of deare friends is, the sorrow that I feele For my Lisanders absence, one that stampes A reverend print on friendship, does assure me You are rivals for a Lady, a faire Lady, And in the acquisition of her favours, Hazard the cutting of that Gordion knot From your first childhood to this present houre, By all the tyes of love and amity fastend, I am blest in a wife (heaven make me thankefull) Inferiour to none (sans pride I speake it) Yet if I were a free-man, and could purchase At any rate the certainty to enjoy Lisanders conversation while I liv'd, Forgive me my Caliste and the Sexe, I never would seeke change. Lid. My Lord and brother, I dare not blame your choice, Lisanders worth, Being a Mistris to be ever courted; Nor shall our equall suit to faire Olinda Weaken, but adde strength to our true affection, With zeale so long continued. Claran. When we know. Whom she prefers, as she can choose but one, By our so long tride friendship we have vow'd The other shall desist. Clea. 'Tis yet your purpose, But how this resolution will hold In him that is refus'd, is not alone Doubtfull, but dangerous. Enter Malfort. Malf. The rich heire is come sir. Cleand. Madam Olinda. Malf. Yes sir, and makes choice, After some little conference with my Lady, Of this room to give answer to her suitors. Cle. Already both look pale, between your hopes To win the prize, and your despaire to lose What you contended for. Lid. No sir, I am arm'd. Clar. I confident of my interest. Cle. Ile beleeve ye when you have endur'd the test. Enter Caliste, Olinda, and Clarinda. Malf. Is not your garter Unty'd? you promis'd that I should grow higher In doing you service. Clar. Fall off or you lose mee. Exit Malf. Cle. Nay take your place, no Paris now sits judge On the contending goddesses. You are The Deitie that must make curst or happy, One of your languishing servants. Ol. I thus look with equal eyes on both, either deserves A fairer fortune then they can in reason Hope for from me; from Lidian I expect, When I have made him mine, all pleasures that The sweetnesse of his manners, youth, and vertues Can give assurance of: but turning this way To brave Clarange, in his face appeares A kinde of majesty which should command, Not sue for favour. If the fairest Lady Of France, set forth with natures best endowments Nay should I adde a Princesse of the bloud, Did now lay claime to either for a husband, So vehement my affection is to both, My envie at her happinesse would kill me. Cle. The strangest love I ever heard. Cal. You can enjoy but one. Clar. The more I say the merrier. Olin. Witnesse these teares I love both, as I know You burne with equall flames, and so affect me; Abundance makes me poore; such is the hard Condition of my fortune; be your owne judges; If I should favour both, 'twill taint my honour, And that before my life I must prefer, If one I leane to, the other is disvalewed; You are fierie both, and love will make you warmer, Clar. The warmer still the fitter. You are a foole Lady. Oli. To what may love, and the devill jealousie spur you Is too apparent: my name's cal'd in question: Your swords flie out, your angers range at large: Then what a murther of my modesty followes? Clar. Take heed of that by any meanes: O innocent, That will deny a blessing when 'tis offer'd, Would I were murther'd so, I would thank my modesty. Cle. What pause you on? Oli. It is at length resolved. Clara. We are on the Rack, uncertain expectation, The greatest torture. Lidian. Command what you please, And you shall see how willingly we will execute. Olinda. Then heare what for your satisfaction, And to preserve your friendship I resolve Against my selfe, and 'tis not to be alter'd: You are both brave gentlemen, Ile still professe it, Both noble servants, for whose gentle offers, The undeserving, and the poore Olinda Is ever bound; you love both, faire, and vertuously; Would I could be so happy to content both: Which since I cannot, take this resolute answer; Goe from me both contentedly, and he That last makes his returne, and comes to visit, Comes to my bed. You know my will: farewell; My heart's too big to utter more: come friend. Cal. Ile wait on you to your Coach. Exeunt Olinda, Caliste, Clarinda. Clean. You both look blank, I cannot blame you. Lid. We have our dispatches. Clara. Ile home. Lid. And Ile abroad again, Farewell. Clara. Farewell to yee. Exit Clarange and Lidian. Clean. Their blunted departure troubles me: I feare A suddaine and a dangerous division Of their long love will follow: have you took Your leave of faire Olinda? Enter Caliste with a purse. Cal. She is gone sir. Cle. Had you brought news Lisander were return'd too, I were most happy. Cal. Still upon Lasander? Cle. I know he loves me, as he loves his health: And heaven knowes I love him. Cal. I finde it so: For me you have forgot, and what I am to you. Cle. O think not so. If you had lost a sister, You lock'd all your delights in, it would grieve you: A little you would wander from the fondnesse, You ow'd your husband: I have lost a friend, A noble friend, all that was excellent In man, or man-kinde, was contain'd within him. That losse my wife— Enter Malfort. Malf. Madam, your noble Father— A fee for my good newes. Cal. Why? what of him sir? Mal. Is lighted at the doore, and longs to see you. Calist. Attend him hither: Clean. O my deare Lisander. But Ile bee merry: lets meet him my Caliste. Cal. I hope Lisanders love will now be buried: My father will bring joy enough for one moneth, To put him out of his memorie. Enter Dorilaus, his arme in a scarffe. Dor. How doe you sonne? Blesse my faire child, I am come to visit yee, To see what house you keep, they say you are bountifull, I like the noyse well, and I come to trie it. Ne're a great belly yet? how have you trifl'd? If I had done so (sonne) I should have heard on't On both sides by Saint Denis. Clean. You are nobly welcome sir: We have time enough for that. Dorilaus. See how she blushes: 'Tis a good signe you'll mend your fault, how dost thou, My good Caliste? Cal. Well, now I see you sir; I hope you bring a fruitfulnesse along with ye. Dor. Good luck, I never misse, I was ever good at it: Your mother groand for't wench, so did some other, But I durst never tell. Cal. How does your arme sir? Clean. Have you been let bloud of late? Dor. Against my will sir. Cal. A fall deare father? Dor. No, a Gun, deare daughter; Two or three Guns; I have one here in my buttock, 'Twould trouble a Surgeons teeth to pull it out. Cal. O me! O me! Dor. Nay, if you fall to fainting, 'Tis time for me to trudge: art such a coward, At the meere name of hurt to change thy colour? I have been shot that men might see clean through me And yet I fainted not: besides my selfe, Here are an hospitall of hurt men for yee. Enter Servants, wounded in severall places. Clean. What should this wonder be? Cal. I am amaz'd at it. Dor. What think ye of these? they are every one hurt soundly, Hurt to the proof, they are through, &amp; through I assure ye; And that's good game, they scorne your puling scratches. Cal. Who did this sir? Dor. Leave crying, and Ile tell you, And get your plaisters, and your warme stupes ready: Have you ne're a Shepheard that can tarre us over? 'Twill proove a businesse else, we are so many. Comming to see you, I was set upon, I and my men, as we were singing frolickly, Not dreaming of an ambush of base rogues, Set on ith'forrest, I have forgot the name— Cle. 'Twixt this, and Fountaine-Bleiu? In the wilde Forrest? Dor. The same, the same, in that accursed Forrest, Set on by villaines, that make boot of all men. The Peeres of France are pillage there, they shot at us, Hurt us, un-hors'd us, came to the sword, there plide us, Opprest us with fresh multitudes, fresh shot still, Rogues that would hang themselves for a fresh doublet, And for a Skarlet Cassock kill their fathers. Cle. Lighted you among these? Dor. Among these murtherers, Our poore blouds were ingag'd: yet we strook bravely, And more then once or twice we made them shun us, And shrink their rugged heads: but we were hurt all. Cle. How came you off? for I even long to hear that. Dor. After our prayers made to heaven to help us, Or to be mercifull unto our soules, So neare we were. Alas poore wench, wipe, wipe. See heaven sends remedy. Cal. I am glad 'tis come sir, My heart was even a bleeding in my body. Dor. A curl'd haire gentleman stept in, a stranger, As he rod by, belike he heard our bickering, Saw our distresses, drew his sword, and prov'd He came to execute, and not to argue. Lord what a lightning me thought flew about him, When he once toss'd his blade; in face Adonis, While peace inhabited between his eye-browes: But when his noble anger stirr'd his mettle, And blew his firie parts into a flame, Like Pallas, when she sits between two armies, Viewing with horrid browes their sad events, Such then hee look'd: and as her shield had arm'd him. Cal. This man sir were a friend to give an age for. This gentleman I must love naturally: Nothing can keep me off; I pray you goe on sir. Dor. I will, for now you please me: this brave youth, This bud of Mars, for yet he is no riper, When once he had drawne bloud, and flesh'd his sword, Fitted his manly mettle to his spirit, How he bestirr'd him? what a lane he made? And through their fierie Bullets thrust securely: The hardned villaines wondring at his confidence, Lame as I was I follow'd, and admir'd too, And stirr'd, and laid about me with new spirit, My men too with new hearts thrust into action, And down the rogues went. Cle. I am strook with wonder. Dor. Remember but the storie of strong Hector, When like to lightning he broke through his van-guard, How the Greeks frighted ran away by Troops, And trod downe Troops to save their lives: so this man, Dispers'd these slaves: had they been more and mightier, He had come off the greater, and more wonder. Cle. Where is the man, good sir, that we may honor him? Cal. That we may fall in superstition to him. Dor. I know not that, from me he late departed, But not without that pious care to see safe Me, and my weak men lodg'd, and dress'd; I urg'd him First hither, that I might more freely thanke him: He told me he had businesse crav'd my pardon, Businesse of much import. Clean. Know you his name? Dor. That he deny'd me too: a vow had bard him. Cal. In that he was not noble to be namelesse. Dor. Daughter you must rem?ber him when I am dead, And in a noble sort requite his piety, 'Twas his desire to dedicate this service To your faire thoughts. Cal. He knowes me then? Dor. I nam'd you, And nam'd you mine: I think that's all his knowledge. Cle. No name, no being? Cal. Now I am mad to know him: Saving mine honour, any thing I had now But to enjoy his sight, but his bare picture; Make me his Saint, I must needs honour him. Serv. I know his name. Cal. There's thy reward for't; speak it. Ser. His man told me, but he desir'd my silence. Cal. O Jasper speak, 'tis thy good Masters cause too: We all are bound in gratitude to compell thee. Serv. Lisander, Yes, I am sure it was Lisander. Cal. Lisander? 'twas Lisander. Cle. 'Tis Lisander. O my base thoughts? my wicked? To make question this act could be another mans: 'Tis Lisander, a handsome timber'd man. Serv. Yes. Cle. My Lisander! was this friends absence to bee mourn'd? Cal. I grant it: Ile mourne his going now, and mourne it seriously: When you weep for him, sir, Ile beare you company. That so much honour, so much honesty Should be in one man, to doe things thus bravely, Make me his Saint, to me give this brave service: VVhat may I doe to recompence his goodnesse? I cannot tell. Cle. Come sir, I know you are sickly, so are your men. Dor. I must confesse I am weake, And fitter for a bed then long discourses. Cle. You shall hear to morrow, to morrow provide Surgeons. Dor. Lisander— Cal. VVhat new fire is this? Lisander— Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Secundus. Scæna prima. Enter Lisander, and Lancelot. Lis. Prethee good Lancelot remember that Thy Masters life is in thy trust, and therefore Be very careful. Lance. I will lose mine owne, rather then hazard yours. Lis. Take what disguise You in your owne discretion shall think fittest, To keep your selfe unknowne. Lanc. I warrant yee; 'Tis not the first time I have gone invisible: I am as fine a Fairie in a businesse Concerning night-worke— Lis. Leave your vanities: VVith this purse (which deliver'd, You may spare your Oratory) convey this Letter to Caliste's woman. Lanc. 'Tis a handsome girle, Mistris Clarinda. Lis. I have made her mine. You know your work. Lanc. And if I sweat not in it, At my returne discarde me. Exit. Lisand. O Caliste! the fairest! cruellest! Enter Clarange. Clar. So early stirring? a good day to you. Lis. I was viewing sir, The site of your house, and the handsomnesse about it: Believe me it stands healthfully and sweetly. Clara. The house and master of it really Are ever at your service. Lis. I returne it: Now if you please goe forward in your storie Of your deare friend and Mistris. Clara. I will tell it, And tell it short, because 'tis breakfast time, (And love a tedious thing to a quick stomach) You eate not yester-night. Lis. I shall endure sir. Clara. My selfe (and as I then deliver'd to you) A gentleman of noble hope, one Lidian, Both brought up from our infancy together, One company, one friendship, and one exercise, Ever affecting, one bed holding us, One griefe, and one joy parted still between us, More then companions, twins in all our actions, VVe grew up till we were men, held one heart still: Time call'd us on to Armes, we were one souldier, Alike we fought our dangers and our honours, Gloried alike one in anothers noblenesse: VVhen Armes had made us fit, we were one lover, VVe lov'd one woman, lov'd without division, And woo'd a long time with one faire affection; And she, as it appeares, loves us alike too. At length considering what our love must grow to, And covet in the end, this one was parted, Rivalls and honours make men stand at distance. VVe then woo'd with advantage, but were friends still, Saluted fairely, kept the peece of love, We could not both enjoy the Ladies favour, Without some scandall to her reputation, We put it to her choice, this was her sentence, To part both from her, and the last returning Should be her Lord; we obey'd, and now you know it; And for my part, (so truely I am touch'd with't) I will goe farre enough, and be the last too, Or ne're returne. Lisand. A sentence of much cruelty; But milde, compar'd with whats pronounc'd on me. Our loving youth is borne to many miseries. What is that Lidian pray ye? Claran. Caliste's brother, if ever you have heard of that faire Ladie. Lisan. I have seen her sir. Claran. Then you have seen a wonder. Lisan. I doe confesse: of what yeares is this Lidian? Clara. About my years: there is not much between us. Lisan. I long to know him. Clara. 'Tis a vertuous longing, As many hopes hang on his noble head, As blossoms on a bough in May, and sweet ones. Lis. Ye are a faire storie of your friend. Clar. Of truth sir: now, what's the matter? Enter a Servant. Serv. There is a gentleman At doore, would speak with you on private businesse. Clara. With me? Serv. He saies so, and brings haste about him. Clara. Wait on him in. Exit Serv. Lisan. I will retire the while, to the next room. Clar. We shall not long disturbe you. Ent. Alcidon. Alc. Save ye sir. Clara. The like to you fair sir: pray you come neare. Alc. Pray you instruct me for I know you not. With Monsieur Clarange I would speake. Clar. I am he sir: Ye are nobly welcome; I wait your businesse. Alcid. This will informe you. Clara. Will you please to sit down? Reads. He shall command me sir, Ile wait upon him Within this houre. Alcid. Y'are a noble gentleman, Wil't please you bring a friend? we are two of us, And pitty either sir should be unfurnish'd. Clara. I have none now, and the time is set so short, 'Twill not be possible. Alc. Doe me the honour: I know you are so full of brave acquaintance, And worthy friends, you cannot want a partner: I would be loath to stand still sir; besides, You know the custome, and the vantage of it, If you come in alone. Clar. And I must meet it. Alc. Send, wee'l defer an houre, let us be equall: Games won and lost on equall tearmes shew fairest. Clar. 'Tis to no purpose to send any whither, Unlesse men be at home by Revelation: So please you breath a while; when I have done with him You may be exercis'd too: Ile trouble no man. Enter Lisander. Lis. They are very loud. Now what's the newes? Clara. I must leave you, Leave you a while, two houres hence Ile returne friend. Lisan. Why, what's the matter? Clar. A little businesse. Lis. And't be but a little, you may take me with ye. Clar. 'Twill be a trouble to you. Lis. No indeed, to do you service, I account a pleasure. Clar. I must alone. Lisan. Why? Clarang. 'Tis necessity— Before you passe the walks, and back agen, I will be with ye. Lis. If it be not unmannerly To presse you, I would goe. Claran. Ile tell you true sir, This gentleman and I upon appointment, Are going to visit a Lady. Lisond. I am no Capuchin, why should not I goe? Alc. Take the gentleman, Come he may see the gentlewoman too, And be most welcome, I do beseech you take him. Lisan. By any means, I love to see a gentlewoman, A prettie wench too. Clar. Well sir, wee'll meet you, And at the place: My service to the Lady. Alc. I kisse your hand. Exit. Clara. Prethee read o're her Letter. Lisander reads. Monsieur, I know you have consider'd the dark sentence Olinda gave us, and that (however she disguis'd it) it pointed more at our swords edges then our bodies banishments; the last must enjoy her: if we retire, our youths ars lost in wandring; in emulation we shall grow old men, and feeble, Which is the scorne of love, and rust of honour, and so return more fit to wed our Sepulchers, then the Saint we aime at; let us therefore make our journey short, and our hearts ready, and with our swords in our hands put it to fortune, which shall be worthy to receive that blessing, Ile stay you on the mountaine, our old hunting place, this gentleman alone runs the hazzard with me, and so I kisse your hand. Your servant Lidian. Is this your wench? you'll finde her a sharp Mistris. What have I thrust my selfe into? is this that Lidian You told me of? Clara. The same. Lisan. My Ladies brother? No cause to heave my sword against but his? To save the father yesterday, and this morning, To help to kill the son? this is most courteous? The onely way to make the daughter doat on me. Clara. Why doe you muse? would ye goe off? Lis. No, no, I must on now; this will be kindly taken; No life to sacrifice, but part of hers? Doe you fight straight? Clara. Yes, presently. Lis. To morrow then, The balefull tidings of this day will break out, And this nights Sun will set in bloud; I am troubl'd: If I am kill'd, I am happy. Clara. VVill you goe friend? Lis. I am ready sir, fortune thou hast made me monstrous. Exeunt. Enter Malfort and Clarinda. Malf. Your cousin, and my true friend, lusty Leon, Shall know how you use me. Clar. Be more temperate, Or I will never use, nor know you more Ith' way of a seruant: all the house takes notice Of your ridiculous fopperie; I have no sooner Perform'd my duties in my Ladies chamber, And she scarce down the staires, but you appeare Like my evill spirit to me. Mal. Can the fish live out of the water, or the Salamander Out of the fire? or I live warme, but in The frying-pan of your favour? Cla. Pray you forget Your curious comparisons, borrowed from The pond, and kitchin, and remember what My Ladies pleasure is for th'entertainment Of her noble father. Ma. I would learn the art of memory in your table book. Cla. Very good sir, no more but up and ride, I apprehend Your meaning, soft fire makes sweet mault sir: I'le answer you in a Proverbe, Mal. But one kisse from thy honey lippe. Cla. You sight too high, my hand is A faire ascent from my foot, his slavering kisses Spoyle me more gloves,—enough for once, you'l surfet With too much grace. Mal. Have you no imployment for me? Cla. Yes, yes, go send for Leon, and convey him Into the private Arbour, from his mouth I heare your praises with more faith. Ma. I am gone, yet one thing ere I go, there's at the dore The rarest Fortune-teller, he hath told me The strangest things; he knows ye are my Mistris, And under seale deliver'd how many children I shall beget on you, pray you give him hearing, He'l make it good to you. Gla. A cunning man Of your own making, howsoe're I'le heare him At your intreaty. Mal. Now I perceive ye love me, At my entreaty, come in friend—remember To speake as I directed, he knows his lesson, And the right way to please her; this it is To have a head-peece. Exit. Enter Lancelot like a Fortune-teller, with a Purse, and two Letters in it. Cla. 'Tis said you can tell Fortunes to come. Lan. Yes Mistris and what's past; Unglove your hand, by this straight line, I see You have laine crooked. Cla. How? laine crooked? Lan. Yes; and in that posture plaid at the old game, (No body heares me, and I'le be no blab) And at it lost your maiden-head. Cla. A shrewd fellow; 'Tis truth, but not to be confess'd; in this Your palmestry deceaves you, some thing else sir. Lan. Ye are a great woman with your Lady, and Acquainted with her counsels. Cla. Still more strange. Lan. There is a noble Knight Lisander loves her, Whom she regards not and the destinies With whom I am familiar, have deliver'd That by your meanes alone, he must enjoy her. Your hand agen, Yes, yes; you have already Promis'd him your assistance, and what's more, Tasted his bounty, for which, from the skye There are 200. crownes dropp'd in a Purse, Looke backe, you'l find it true; nay, open it, 'Tis good Gold I assure you. Cla. How, two Letters? the first indors'd to me? this to my Lady? Subscrib'd Lisander. Lan. And the Fortuneteller, his servant Lancelot. Cla. How had I lost my eyes, That I could not know thee? not a word of the losse Of my virginity. Lanc. Nor who I am. Cla. I'le use all speedy meanes for your dispatch, With a welcome answer, but till you receive it, Continue thus disguis'd, Mounsieur Malfort (You know the way to humour him) shall provide A lodging for you, and good entertainment; Nay, since we trade both one way, thou shalt have Some feeling with me, take that. Lan. Bountifull wench may'st thou ne're want imployment. Cla. Nor such pay boy. Exeunt. Enter Lidian, Alcidon, (at one dore) Lisander, Clarange (at another.) Lid. You'r welcome. Alc. Let us do our office first, And then make choice of a new peece of ground To try our fortunes. Lis. All's faire here. Alc. And here, their swords are equall. Lis. If there be any odds in mine, we will exchange. Alc. Wee'l talke of that When we are farther off, farwell. Lis. Farewell friend. Ex. Lisand. and Alcid Lid. Come let us not be idle? Cla. I will find you imployment, feare not. Lid. You know sir, the cause that brings us hether Cla. There needs no more discoursing, No time, nor place for repetition now. Lid. Let our Swords argue, and I wish Clarange, The proud Olinda saw us. Cla. Would she did; What ever estimation she holds of me, She should behold me like a man fight for her. Lid. 'Tis nobly said; set on love; and my fortune— Cla. The same for me, come home brave Lidian, 'Twas manly thrust, this token to the Lady, Ye have it sir, deliver it, take breath, I see ye bleed apace, ye shall have faire play. Enter Lisander. Lis. You must lye there a while, I cannot help you, Lid. Nay, then my fortunes gone, I know I must dye: Yet dearely will I sell my love, come on both, And use your fortunes, I expect no favour; Weake as I am, my confidence shall meet ye. Cla. Yeild up your cause and live. Lid. What dost thou hold me? A recreant, that prefers life before credit? Though I bleed hard, my honour finds no Issue, That's constant to my heart. Cla. Have at your life then. Lis. Hold, or I'le turne, and bend my sword against ye; My cause Clarange too, view this brave Gentleman, That yet may live to kill you, he stands nobly, And has as great a promise of the day As you can tye unto your selfe, he's ready, His Sword as sharpe, view him with that remembrance, That you deliver'd him to me Clarange: And with those eyes, that clearnesse will become ye: View him, as you reported him; survey him, Fixe on your friendship sir, I know you are noble, And step but Inward to your old affection, Examine but that soule grew to your bosome, And try then if your Sword will bite, it cannot, The edge will turne againe, asham'd, and blunted; Lidian, you are the patterne of faire friendship, Exampled for your Love, and imitated, The Temple of true hearts, stor'd with affections, For sweetnesse of your spirit made a Saint, Can you decline this noblenesse to anger? To mortall anger? 'gainst the man ye love most? Have ye the name of vertuous, not the nature? Lid. I will sit downe. Clarin. And I'le sit by you Lidian. Lis. And I'le go on, can heaven be pleas'd with these things? To see two hearts that have been twin'd together Married in friendship to the world, to wonder, Of one growth, of one nourishment, one health, Thus mortally divorc'd for one weake woman? Can love be pleas'd? love is a gentle spirit, The wind that blowes the Aprill flowers, not softer; She is drawne with doves to shew her peacefulnesse, Lions and bloudy Pards are Mars's servants; Would ye serve love? do it with humblenesse, Without a noise, with still prayers, and soft murmurs; Upon her Altars offer your obedience, And not your brawles; she's won with teares, not terrors: That fire ye kindle to her deity, Is only gratefull when it blowes with sighs, And holy Incense slung with white hand-innocence; Ye wound her now; ye are too superstitious, No sacrifice of bloud, or death she longs for: Lid. Came he from heaven? Clarin. He tels us truth good Lidian. Lis. That part of Noble love which is most sweet, And gives eternall being to faire beauty, Honour. You hack a peeces with your swords, And that ye fight to crowne, ye kill faire credit. Clara. Thus we embrace, no more fight, but all friendship, And where love pleases to bestow his benefits, Let us not argue. Lid. Nay brave sir, come in too; You may love also, and may hope, If he do, And not rewarded for't, there is no justice; Farwell friend, here let's part upon our pilgrimage, It must be so, Cupid draws on our sorrowes. And where the lot lights— Claran. I shall count it happinesse, Farewell deare friend. Lis. First, let's relieve the Gentleman That lyes hurt in your cause, and bring him off, And take some cure for your hurts, then I will part too, A third unfortunate, and willing wanderer. Exeunt. Enter Olinda, and Caliste. Olin. My feares foresaw 'twould come to this. Cal. I would your sentence had been milder. Olin. 'Tis past helpe now. Cal. I share in your despaire, and yet my hopes Have not quite left me, since all possible meanes Are practised to prevent the mischiefe following Their mortall meeting, my Lord is coasted one way, My father, though his hurts forbad his travell, Hath tooke another, my brother in Law Beronte, A third, and every minute we must looke for The certaine knowledge, which we must endure With that calme patience heav'n shall please to lend us. Enter Dorilaus, and Cleander, severally. Dor. Dead both? Clea. Such is the rumour, and 'tis generall. Olin. I heare my passing-bell. Cal. I am in a feavour. Clea. They say their seconds too; but what they are, Is not known yet, some worthy fellows certain. Dor. Where had you knowledge? Clea. Of the Country people, 'tis spoken every where. Dor. I heard it so too; And 'tis so common, I do halfe beleeve it, You have lost a brother wench, he lov'd you well, And might have liv'd to have done his countrie service, But he is gone, thou feld'st untimely Lidian, But by a valiant hand, that's some small comfort, And tooke him with thee too, thou lov'st brave company, Weeping will do no good, you lost a servant, He might have liv'd to have been your Master Lady, But you fear'd that. Olind. Good sir, be tender to me, The newes is bad enough, you need not presse it, I lov'd him well, I lov'd 'em both. Dor. It seemes so. How many more have you to love so Lady? They were both fooles to fight for such a Fidle; Certaine there was a dearth of noble anger, When a slight woman was thought worth a quarrell. Olin. Pray you thinke nobler. Do. I'le tell thee what I thinke, the plague, war, famine, Nay put in dice and drunkennesse, and those You'l grant are pretty helpes, kill not so many (I meane so many noble) as your loves do, Rather your lewdnesse, I crave your mercy women. Be not offended if I anger ye. I am sure ye have touch'd me deep, I came to be merry, And with my children, but to see one ruin'd By this fell accident—are they all dead? If they be, speake? Clean. What newes? Enter Beronte, Alcidon, Clarinda, following with a letter, Ber. What dead? ye pose me; I understand you not. Clea. My brother Lidian, Clarange, and their seconds. Ber. Here is one of 'em, and sure this Gentleman's alive. Alc. I hope so, so is your son sir, so is brave Clarange: They fought indeed, and they were hurt sufficiently; We were all hurt, that bred the generall rumour, But friends againe all, and like friends we parted. Clea. Heard ye of Lisander? Ber. Yes, and miss'd him narrowly: He was one of the combatants, fought with this Gentleman, Second against your brother, by his wisdome (For certainly good fortune followes him) All was made peace, I'le tell you the rest at dinner, For we are hungry. Alc. I before I eate Must pay a vow I am sworne to; my life Madam Was at Lisander's mercy, I live by it; And for the noble favour, he desir'd me To kisse your faire hand for him, offering This second service as a Sacrifice At the Altar of your vertues. Dor. Come, joy on all sides; Heaven will not suffer honest men to perish. Clean. Be proud of such a friend. Dor. Forgive me Madam, It was a griefe might have concern'd you neare too. Clea. No worke of excellence but still Lisander, Go thy waies worthy. Ex. Manet. Cal. Clarin. stayes Calist. Olin. Wee'l be merry too, Were I to speake againe, I would be wiser. Cal. Too much of this rare cordiall makes me sick, However I obey you. Clarin. Now or never is an apt time to move her, Madam. Cal. Who's that? Clari. Your servant, I would speake with your Ladyship, Cal. Why dost thou looke about? Clarin. I have private businesse That none must heare but you Lisander— Cal. Where? Clarin. Nay, is not here, but would entreat this favor, Some of your Balsome from your own hand given, For he is much hurt, and that he thinkes would cure him. Cal. He shall have all, my prayers too. Clarind. But conceive, me, It must be from your selfe immediately, Pitty so brave a Gentleman should perish, He is superstitious, and he holds your hand Of infinite power: I would not urge this Madam, But only in a mans extreames, to helpe him. Cal. Let him come (good wench) 'tis that I wish, I am happy in't, My husband his true friend, my noble father, The faire Olinda, all desire to see him; He shall have many hands. Clarind. That he desires not, Nor eyes, but yours to looke upon his miseries, For then he thinkes 'twould be no perfect cure (Madam) He would come private. Cal. How can that be here? I shall do wrong unto all those that honour him, Besides my credit. Clarin. Dare ye not trust a hurt man? Not straine a curtesie to save a Gentleman? To save his life that has sav'd all your family? A man that comes like a poore mortifi'd Pilgrim; Only to beg a blessing, and depart againe? He would but see you, that he thinkes would cure him. But since you find fit reasons to the contrary, And that it cannot stand with your cleare honour, Though you best know how well he has deserv'd of ye: I'l send him word backe, though I grieve to do it, Grieve at my soule, for certainly 'twill kill him, What your will is. Cal. Stay, I will thinke upon't; where is he wench? Clarin. If you desire to see him, Let not that trouble you, he shall be with ye, And in that time, that no man shall suspect ye; Your honour Madam, is in your own free keeping; Your care in me, in him all honesty; If ye desire him not, let him passe by ye: And all this businesse reckon but a dreame. Cal. Go in, and counsell me, I would faine see him, And willingly comfort him. Clarin. 'Tis in your power. And if you dare trust me, you shall do it safely, Read that, and let that tell you, how he honours you. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Tertius. Scæna prima. Enter Clarinda, with a Key, and Leon. Leon. This happy night. Kisses her. Clarin. Preserve this eagernesse Till we meet nearer, there is something done Will give us opportunity. Leon. Witty girle, the plot? Clarind. You shall heare that at leasure, The whole house reeles with joy at the report Of Lidians safety, and that joy increas'd From their affection to the brave Lisander, In being made the happy instrument to compound The bloudy difference. Leon. They will heare shortly that Will turne their mirth to mourning, he was then The principall meanes to save two lives, but since There are two falne, and by his single hand, For which his life must answer, if the King, Whose arme is long, can reach him. Cla. We have now no spare time to heare stories, take this key, 'Twill make your passage to the banquetting house I'the garden free. Leon. You will not faile to come? Cla. For mine owne sake ne're doubt it? now for Lisander. Exit. Enter Dorilaus, Cleander, Servants with lights. Dor. To bed, to bed, 'tis very late. Clea. To bed all, I have dranke a health too much, Dor. You'l sleep the better, My usuall phisicke that way. Clean. Where's your Mistris? Clarin. She is above, but very ill and aguish: The late fright of her brother, has much troubl'd her; She would entreate to lye alone. Clea. Her pleasure. Do. Commend my love to her, and my prayers for her health, I'le see her ere I goe. Ex. Manet Clarin. Clarin. All good rest to ye: Now to my watch for Lisander, when he's furnish'd, For mine own friend, since I stand Centinell, I love to laugh i'th' evenings too, and may, The priviledge of my place will warrant it. Exit. Enter Lisander, and Lancelot. Lis. You have done well hetherto; where are we now? Lan. Not far from the house, I heare by th'owles, There are many of your welch falkoners about it; Here were a night to choose to run away with Another mans wife, and do the feate. Lis. Peace knave, The house is here before us, and some may heare us; The candles are all out. Lanc. But one i'the parlor, I see it simper hether, pray come this way. Lis. Step to the garden doore, and feele and't be open. Lan. I am going, lucke deliver me from the saw pits, Or I am buried quicke: I heare a dog, No, 'tis a cricket, ha? here's a cuckold buried, Take heed of his horns sir, here's the doore, 'tis open. Clarinda at the doore. Whose there? Lisan. Friend. Cla. Sir, Lisander? Lis. I. Clarin. Ye are welcome, follow me, and make no noise. Lis. Go to your horse, and keep your watch with care, sirah And be sure ye sleep not. Ex. Lisan. Clarin. Lanc. Send me out the dairy-maid To play at trump with me, and keep me waking, My fellow horse, and I now must discourse Like two learned Almanack-makers, of the stars, And tell what a plentifull year 'twil prove of drunkards, If I had but a pottle of Sacke, like a sharp prickle, To knock my nose against when I am nodding, I should sing like a Nightingall, but I must Keepe watch without it, I am apt to dance, Good fortune guide me from the faires circles. Exit. Enter Clarinda with a Taper, and Lisander with a Pistole, two Chaires set out. Clarin. Come neare, Caliste sitting behind a Curtaine. I'le leave ye now, draw but that Curtaine, And have your wish; now Leon I am for thee. We that are servants must make use of stoln houres, And be glad of snatch'd occasions. Exit. Lisand. Shee is asleepe, Fierce love hath clos'd his lights, I may looke on her, Within her eyes 'has lock'd his graces up, I may behold and live; how sweet she breathes? The orient morning breaking out in odors, Is not so full of perfumes, as her breath is; She is the abstract of all excellence, and scornes a paralell. Cal. Who's there? Lis. Your servant, your most obedient slave (adored Lady) That comes but to behold those eyes againe, And pay some vowes I have to sacred beauty, And so passe by; I am blind as ignorance, And know not where I wander, how I live, Till I receive from their bright influence Light to direct me, for devotions sake, You are the Saint I tread these holy steps to. And holy Saints are all relenting sweetnesse; Be not inrag'd nor be not angry with me; The greatest attribute of heaven is mercy; And 'tis the crowne of justice, and the glory Where it may kill with right, to save with pitty. Cal. Why do you kneele, I know you come to mock me, T'upbraid me with the benefits you have giv'n me, Which are too many, and to mighty sir, For my returne; and I confesse 'tis justice, That for my cruelty you should despise me, And I expect however you are calme now, A foyle you strive to set your cause upon, It will breake out; Caliste is unworthy, Coy, proud, disdainefull, I acknowledge all, Colder of comfort than the frozen North is, And more a stranger to Lisanders worth, His youth and faith, then it becomes her gratitude, I blush to grant it, yet take this along, A soveraigne medicine to allay displeasure, May be an argument to bring me off too; She is married, and she is chaste; how sweet that sounds? How it perfumes all ayre 'tis spoken in? O deare Lisander, would you breake this union? Lis. No, I adore it: let me kisse your hand, And seale the faire faith of a Gentleman on it. Cal. You are truly valiant, would it not afflict you To have the horrid name of coward touch you? Such is the whore to me. Lis. I nobly thanke ye; And may I be the same when I dishonour ye; This I may do againe. (Kissing her hand. Cal. Ye may, and worthily; Such comforts maids may grant with modesty, And neither make her poore, nor wrong her bounty; Noble Lisander, how fond now am I of ye? I heard you were hurt. Lis. You dare not heale me Lady? I am hurt here; how sweetly now she blushes? Excellent objects kill our sight, she blinds me; The roses in the pride of May shew pale to her; O tyrant custome! and O coward honour! How ye compell me to put on mine owne chaines? May I not kisse ye now in superstition? For you appeare a thing that I would kneele to: Let me erre that way. Kisses her. Cal. Ye shall erre for once, I have a kind of noble pity on you, Among your manly sufferings, make this most, To erre no farther in desire, for then sir, Ye adde unto the gratitudes I owe you; And after death, your deare friends soule shall blesse you. Lis. I am wondrous honest. Cal. I dare try. Kisses. Lis. I have tasted a blessednesse too great for dull mortality Once more and let me dye. Cal. I dare not murther, How will maids curse me if I kill with kisses? And young men flye th'embraces of faire virgins? Come pray sit down, but let's talke temperately. Lis. Is my deare friend a bed? Cal. Yes, and asleep; Secure asleep, 'tis midnight too Lisander, Speake not so loud. Lis. You see I am a Statue, I could not stand else as I had eaten Ice, Or tooke into my bloud a drowzie poyson, And natures noblest, brightest flame burne in me; Midnight? and I stand quietly to behold so? The alarme rung, and I sleep like a coward? I am worne away, my faith, and dull obedience Like crutches, carry my decayed body Down to the grave, I have no youth within me, Yet happily you love too. Cal. Love with honour. Lis. Honour? what's that? 'tis but a specious title We should not prize too high. Cal. Dearer than life. Lis. The value of it, is as time has made it, And time and custome have too far insulted, We are no Gods, to be alwaies tyed to strictnesse, 'Tis a presumption to shew too like 'em; March but an houre or two under loves ensignes, We have examples of great memories— Cal. But foule ones too, that greatnesse cannot cover; That wife that by example sins, sins double, And puls the curtaine open to her shame too; Me thinkes to enjoy you thus— Lis. 'Tis no joy Lady, A longing bride if she stop here, would cry, The Bridegroome too, and with just cause curse Hymen; But yeild a little, be one houre a woman, (I do not speake this to compell you Lady) And give your will but motion, let it stirre But in the taste of that weake feares call evill, Try it to understand it, wee'l do no thing, You'l never come to know pure good else. Cal. Fie sir. Lis. I have found a way, let's slip into this errour As Innocents, that know not what we did; As we were dreaming both let us embrace; The sin is none of ours then, but our fancies; What have I said? what blasphemie to honour? O my base thoughts! pray ye take this and shoot me. My villaine thoughts? Noise within. Cal. I weep your miserie, and would to heaven.—what noise? Lis. It comes on louder. Kill me, and save your selfe; save your faire honour, And lay the fault on me, let my life perish, My base lascivious life, shoote quickely Lady, Cal. Not for the world, retire behind the hangings, And there stand close—my husband, close Lisander. Clean. Dearest, are you well? Enter Cleander with a Taper. Cal. O my sad heart; my head, my head. Clea. Alas poore soule! what do you out of your bed? You take cold my Caliste: how do ye? Cal. Not so well sir to lye by ye, my brothers fright— Clea. I had a frightfull dreame too, A very frightfull dreame my best Caliste: Me thought there came a Dragon to your Chamber, A furious Dragon (wife) I yet shake at it: Are all things well? Lis. Shall I shoote him? Cal. No. All well Sir. 'Twas but your care of me, your loving care, Which alwaies watches. Clean. And me thought he came As if he had risen thus out of his den, As I do from these hangings. Lis. Dead. Cal. Hold good Sir. Clea. And forc'd ye in his armes thus. Cal. 'Twas but fancie That troubled ye, here's nothing to disturbe me, Good sir to rest againe, and I am now drousie, And will to bed; make no noise deare husband, But let me sleep: before you can call any body I am a bed. Clea. This, and sweet rest dwell with ye. Exit. Cal. Come out againe, and as you love Lisander, Make haste away, you see his mind is troubled: Do you know the doore ye came at? Lis. Well sweet Lady. Cal. And can ye hit it readily? Lis. I warrant ye; And must I go? must here end all my happinesse? Here in a dreame, as if it had no substance? Cal. For this time friend, or here begin our ruines; We are both miserable. Lis. This is some comfort In my afflictions; they are so full already, They can find no encrease. Cal. Deare speake no more. Lis. You must be silent then. Cal. Farewell Lisander, thou joy of man farewell. Lis. Farewell bright Lady, Honour of woman-kind, a heavenly blessing. Cal. Be ever honest. Lis. I will be a dog else; The vertues of your mind I'le make my library, In which I'le study the celestiall beauty: Your constancie, my armour that I'le fight in: And on my sword your chastity shall sit, Terror to rebell bloud. Cal. Once more farewell: Noise within. O that my modestie cou'd hold you still sir,—he comes againe. Lis. Heaven keep my hand from murther, Murther of him I love. Cal. Away deare friend, Down to the garden staires, that way Lisander, We are betrai'd else. Ent. Clea. Lis. Honour guard the Innocent. Exit. Lis. Clean. Stil up? I fear'd your health. Cal. 'Has miss'd him happily; I am going now, I have done my meditations, My heart's almost at peace. Clea. To my warme bed then. Cal. I will pray ye lead. A Pistoll shot within Clean. A Pistoll shot i'th' house? At these houres? sure some theefe, some murtherer: Rise ho, rise all, I am betraide. Cal. O fortune! O giddy thing! he has met some opposition, And kil'd; I am confounded, lost for ever. Enter Dorilaus Dor. Now, what's the matter? Clea. Theeves, my noble father, villaines, and Rogues. Dor. Indeed, I heard a Pistoll, let's search about. Enter Malfort, Clarinda, and Servants. Mal. To bed againe, they are gone sir, I will not bid you thanke my valour for't; Gone at the garden doore; there were a dozen, And bravely arm'd, I saw 'em. Clarin. I am glad, glad at the heart. Ser. One shot at me, and miss'd me. Mal. No, 'twas at me, the bullet flew close by me, Close by my eare; another had a huge Sword, Flourish'd it thus; but at the point I met him, But the Rogue taking me to be your Lordship, (As sure your name is terrible, and we Not much unlike in the darke) roar'd out aloud, 'Tis the kill cow Dorilaus, and away They ran as they had flowne: now you must love me, Or feare me for my courage wench. Clarin. O Rogue? O lying Rogue, Lisander stumbled Madam, At the staires head, and in the fall the shot went off; Was gone before they rose. Cal. I thanke heaven for't. Clari. I was frighted too, it spoyl'd my game with Leon. Cle. You must sit up; and they had come to your Chamber What pranks would they have plaid: how came the doore open? Ma. I heard 'em when they forc'd it; up I rose, Took Durindana in my hand; and like Orlando, issu'd forth. Clarin. I know you are valiant. Clean. To bed again, And be you henceforth provident, at sun-rising We must part for a while. Dor. When you are a bed, Take leave of her, there 'twill be worth the taking; Here 'tis but a cold ceremony, ere long Wee'l find Lisander, or we have ill fortune. Clea. Locke all the doores fast. Mal. Though they all stood open, My name writ on the doore, they dare not enter. Exeunt. Enter Claran, Frier with a Letter. Claran. Turnd Hermit? Fri. Yes, and a devout one too: I heard him preach. Claran. That lessens my beliefe, For though I grant my Lidian a scholler As far as fits a Gentleman, he hath studied Humanity, and in that he is a Master; Civility of manners, courtship, Armes; But never aim'd at (as I could perceive) The deep points of divinity. Fri. That confirmes his Devotion to be reall, no way tainted With ostentation, or hypocrisie, The cankers of Religion; his sermon So full of gravity, and with such sweetnesse Deliver'd, that it drew the admiration Of all the hearers on him; his own letters To you, which witnesse he will leave the world, And these to faire Olinda, his late Mistris, In which he hath with all the moving language That ever express'd Rhetorick, sollicited The Lady to forget him, and make you Blessed in her embraces, may remove All scrupulous doubts. Claran. It strikes a sadnesse in me, I know not what to thinke of't. Fri. Ere he entred His sollitary cell, he pen'd a ditty, His long and last farewell to love, and women, So feelingly, that I confesse however It stands not with my order to be taken With such Poeticall raptures; I was mov'd, And strangely with it. Claran. Have you the copy? Fri. Yes sir: My Novice too can sing it, if you please To give him hearing. Claran. And it will come timely, For I am full of melancholy thoughts, Against which I have heard with reason Musick To be the speediest cure, pray you apply it. A Song by the Novice. Adieu fond love, farewell you wanton powers, I am free againe; Thou dull disease of bloud and Idle howers. Bewitching paine, Flie to the fooles that sigh away their time. My nobler love to heaven clime, And there behold beauty still young, That time can ne're corrupt, nor death destroy; Immortall sweetnesse by faire Angels sung, And honour'd by eternity and joy: There lives my love, thether my hopes aspire; Fond love declines, this heavenly love growes higher. Fri. How do ye approve it? Claran. To its due desert, It is a heavenly Hymne, no ditty father, It passes through my eares unto my soule, And workes divinely on it; give me leave A little to consider; shall I be Out done in all things? nor good of my selfe, Nor by example? shall my loose hopes still, The viands of a fond affection, feed me As I were a sensuall beast, spirituall food Refus'd by my sicke pallat? 'tis resolv'd. How far off father, doth this new made Hermit Make his abode? Fri. Some two dayes journey son. Claran. Having reveal'd my faire intentions to ye, I hope your piety will not deny me Your aides to further 'em? Fri. That were against a good mans charity. Claran. My first request is, You would some time, for reasons I will shew you, Defer delivery of Lidians Letters To faire Olinda. Fri. Well sir. Claran. For what followes, You shall direct me; something I will do, A new borne zeale, and friendship prompts me to. Ex. Enter Dorilaus, Cleander, Chamberlaine, Table, Tapers, and three stooles. Clea. We have supp'd well friend; let our beds be ready, We must be stirring early, Cham. They are made sir. Dor. I cannot sleep yet, where's the joviall host You told me of? 'tas been my custome ever To parley with mine host. Clea. He's a good fellow, And such a one I know you love to laugh with; Go call your Master up. Cham. He cannot come sir. Dor. Is he a bed with his wife? Cham. No certainly. Dor. Or with some other ghests? Cham. Neither and't like ye. Clea. Why then he shall come by your leave my friend, I'le fetch him up my selfe. Cham. Indeed you'l faile sir. Dor. Is he i'th' house? Cham. No, but he is hard by sir; He is fast in's grave, he has been dead these three weekes. Dor. Then o' my conscience he will come but lamely, And discourse worse. Clean. Farewell mine honest Host then, Mine honest merry Host; will you to bed yet? Dor. No, not this houre, I prethee sit and chat by me. Clean. Give us a quart of wine then, wee'l be merry. Dor. A match my son; pray let your wine be living, Or lay it by your Master. Cham. It shall be quick sir. Exit. Dor. Has not mine Host a wife? Clean. A good old woman. Dor. Another coffine, that is not so hansome; Your Hostesses in Innes should be blith things, Pretty, and young to draw in passengers; She'l never fill her beds well, if she be not beauteous. Clean. And curteous too. Enter Chamberlaine with wine. Dor. I, I, and a good fellow, That will mistake sometimes a Gentleman For her good man; well done; here's to Lisander. Clean. My full love meets it; make fire in our lodgings, Wee'l trouble thee no farther; to your Son. Ex. Cham. Dor. Put in Clarange too; off with't, I thanke ye; This wine drinkes merrier still, O for mine Host now, Were he alive againe, and well dispos'd, I would so claw his pate. Clean. Y'are a hard drinker. Dor. I love to make mine Host drunke, he will lye then The rarest, and the roundest, of his friends, His quarrels, and his ghests, and they are the best bauds too Take 'em in that tune. Clean. You know all. Dor. I did son, but time, and armes have worne me out Clea. 'Tis late sir, I heare none stirring. A lute is struck. Dor. Hark, what's that, a Lute? 'Tis at the doore I thinke. Clean. The doores are shut fast. Dor. 'Tis morning sure, the Fidlers are got up To fright mens sleepes, have we ne're a pispot ready? Clea. Now I remember, I have heard mine Host that's dead, Touch a lute rarely, and as rarely sing too, A brave still meane. Dor. I would give a brace of French Crownes To see him rise and Fidle. A Song. [Host.] Tis late and cold, stirre up the fire; Sit close, and draw the Table nigher; Be merry, and drinke wine that's old, A hearty medicine 'gainst a cold. Your beds of wanton downe the best, Where you shall tumble to your rest; I could wish you wenches too, But I am dead and cannot do; Call for the best the house may ring, Sacke, White, and Claret let them bring, And drinke apace while breath you have, You'l find but cold drinke in the grave; Plover, Patridge for your dinner, And a Capon for the sinner, You shall find ready when you are up, And your horse shall have his sup: Welcome shall flye round, And I shall smile though under ground. Clean. Harke, a Song, now as I live, it is his voice. Dor. He sings well, the devill has a pleasant pipe. Clea. The fellow lyed sure, Enter Host. He is not dead, he's here: how pale he lookes? Dor. Is this he? Clean. Yes. Host. You are welcome noble Gentlemen, My brave old ghest most welcome. Clean. Lying knaves, To tell us you were dead, come sit downe by us, We thanke ye for your Song. Host. Would 't had been better. Dor. Speake, are ye dead? Host. Yes indeed am I Gentlemen, I have been dead these three weekes. Dor. Then here's to ye, to comfort your cold body. Clean. What do ye meane? stand further off. Dor. I will stand nearer to him, Shall he come out on's coffin to beare us company, And we not bid him welcome? come mine Host, Mine honest Host, here's to ye. Host. Spirits sir, drinke not? Clea. Why do ye appeare? Host. To waite upon ye Gentlemen, 'T has been my duty living, now my farewell; I feare ye are not us'd accordingly. Dor. I could wish you warmer company mine Host, How ever we are us'd? Host. Next to entreate a courtesie, And then I goe to peace. Clea. Is't in our power? Host. Yes and 'tis this, to see my body buried In holy ground, for now I lye unhallowed, By the clarkes fault; let my new grave be made Amongst good fellowes, that have died before me, And merry Hostes of my kind. Clea. It shall be done. Dor. And forty stoopes of wine dranke at thy funerall. Clea. Do you know our travell? Host. Yes, to seeke your friends, That in afflictions wander now. Clean. Alas! Host. Seeke 'em no farther, but be confident They shall returne in peace. Dor. There's comfort yet. Clea. Pray ye one word more, is't in your power mine Host, Answer me softly, some houres before my death, To give me warning? Host. I cannot tell ye truly, But if I can, so much alive I lov'd ye, I will appeare againe, adieu. Exit. Dor. Adieu sir. Clean. I am troubl'd; these strange apparitions are For the most part fatall. Dor. This if told, will not Find credit, the light breakes a pace, let's lye downe And take some little rest, an houre or two, Then do mine hostes desire, and so returne, I do beleeve him. Clean. So do I, to rest sir. Exeunt. Enter Caliste, and Clarinda. Cal. Clarinda? Clarin. Madam. Cal. Is the house well ordered? The doores look'd to now in your Masters absence? Your care, and diligence amongst the Servants? Clarin. I am stirring Madam. Cal. So thou art Clarinda, More then thou ought'st I am sure, why dost thou blush? Clarin. I do not blush. Cal. Why dost thou hang thy head wench? Clarin. Madam, ye are deceiv'd, I looke upright, I understand ye not: she has spied Leon, aside. Shame of his want of caution. Cal. Looke on me; what, blush againe? Clarin. 'Tis more then I know Madam; I have no cause that I find yet. Cal. Examine then. Clarin. Your Ladyship is set I thinke to shame me. Cal. Do not deserve't. who lay with you last night? What bedfellow had ye? none of the maids came neare ye. Clarin. Madam they did. Cal. 'Twas one in your Cosins cloathes then, And wore a sword; and sure I keep no Amazons; Wench do not lye, 'twill but proclame thee guilty; Lyes hide our sins like nets; like perspectives, They draw offences nearer still, and greater. Come tell the truth. Clarin. You are the strangest Lady To have these doubts of me; how have I liv'd Madam? And which of all my carefull services deserves these shames? Cal. Leave facing? 'twill not serve ye, This impudence becomes thee worse then lying? I thought ye had liv'd well, and I was proud of't; But you are pleas'd to abuse my thoughts: who was't? Honest repentance yet will make the fault lesse. Clarin. Do ye compell me? do you stand so strict too? Nay, then have at ye; I shall rub that sore Madam. (Since ye provoke me) will but vexe your Ladyship; Let me alone. Cal. I will know. Clarin. For your own peace, The peace of your owne conscience aske no farther; Walke in, and let me alone. Cal. No, I will know all. Clarin. Why, then I'le tell ye, 'twas a man I lay with, Never admire, 'tis easie to be done, Madam, And usuall too, a proper man I lay with; Why should you vexe at that? young as Lisander, And able too; I grudge not at your pleasure, Why should you stir at mine? I steale none from ye, Cal. And dost thou glory in this sin? Clarin. I am glad on't, to glory in't is for a mighty Lady That may command. Cal. Why didst thou name Lisander? Clarin. Does it anger ye? does it a little gall ye? I know it does, why would ye urge me Lady? Why would ye be so curious to compell me? I nam'd Lisander as my president, The rule I err'd by, you love him, I know it, I grudg'd not at it, but am pleas'd it is so; And by my care and diligence you enjoy'd him. Shall I for keeping counsell, have no comfort? Will you have all your selfe? ingrosse all pleasure? Are ye so hard hearted? why do ye blush now Madam? Cal. My anger blushes, not my shame base woman. Clari. I'le make your shame blush, since you put me to't Who lay with you t'other night? Cal. With me? ye monster. Clarin. Whose sweet embraces circled ye? not your husbands; I wonder ye dare touch me in this point Madam? Stir her against ye in whose hand your life lies? More then your life your honour? what smug Amazon Was that I brought you? that maid had ne're a petticoat? Cal. She'l halfe perswade me anon, I am a beast too, And I mistrust my selfe, though I am honest For giving her the Helme, thou knowest Clarinda, (Ev'n in thy conscience) I was ever vertuous; As far from lust in meeting with Lisander As the pure wind in welcoming the morning; In all the conversation I had with him, As free, and innocent, as yon'd faire heaven; Didst not thou perswade me too? Clarin. Yes, I had reason for't, And now you are perswaded I'le make use on't. Cal. If I had sin'd thus, and my youth entic'd me, The noblenesse and beauty of his person, Beside the mighty benefits I am bound to, Is this sufficient warrant for thy weakenesse? If I had been a whore, and crav'd thy counsell In the conveyance of my fault, and faithfulnesse, Thy secrecie, and truth in hiding of it; Is it thy justice to repay me thus? To be the Master sinner to compell me? And build thy lusts security on mine honour? Clarin. They that love this sin, love their security; Prevention Madam is the naile I knock'd at, And I have hit it home, and so I'le hold it, And you must pardon me, and be silent too, And suffer what ye see, and suffer patiently; I shall do worse else. Cal. Thou canst not touch my credit, Truth will not suffer me to be abus'd thus. Clarin. Do not you sticke to truth, she is seldome heard Madam, A poore weake tongue she has, and that is hoarse too With pleading at the bars, none understands her, Or if you had her, what can she say for ye? Must she not sweare he came at midnight to ye, The doore left open, and your husband cozen'd With a feign'd sicknesse? Cal. But by my soule I was honest, thou know'st I was honest. Clarin. That's all one what I know, What I will testifie is that shall vexe ye; Trust not a guilty rage with likelihoods, And on apparent proofe, take heed of that Madam; If you were innocent (as it may be ye are) I do not know, I leave it to your conscience, It were the weakest and the poorest part of ye, Men being so wil'ing to beleeve the worst, So open eyed in this age to all infamie, To put your fame in this weake barke to the venture. Cal. What do I suffer? O my pretious honour, Into what boxe of evils have I lock'd thee? Yet rather then be thus outbrav'd, and by My drudg, my footstoole, one that sued to be so; Perish both life, and honour, devill thus I dare thy worst, defie thee, spit at thee, And in my vertuous rage, thus trample on thee; Awe me thy Mistris, whore, to be thy baud? Out of my house, proclame all that thou knowest, Or malice can invent, fetch jealousie From hell, and like a furie breath it in The bosome of my Lord; and to thy utmost Blast my faire fame, yet thou shalt feele with horror To thy sear'd conscience, my truth is built On such a firme base, that if e're it can Be forc'd, or undermin'd by thy base scandals, Heaven keeps no guard on Innocence. Exit. Clarin. I am lost, In my owne hopes forsaken, and must fall. The greatest torment to a guilty woman Without revenge, till I can fashion it I must submit, at least appeare as if I did repent, and would offend no farther. Monsieur Beronte my Lords brother is Oblieg'd unto me for a private favour; 'Tis he must mediate for me; but when time And oportunity bids me strike, my wreake Shall powre it selfe on her nice chastitie Like to a torrent, deeds, not words shall speake me.

      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quartus. Scæna prima. Enter Alcidon, and Beronte severally. Alc. Ye are oportunely met. Ber. Your countenance expresses hast mixt with some feare. Alc. You'l share with me in both, as soone as you are made Acquainted with the cause, if you love vertue, In danger not secure; I have no time For circumstance, instruct me if Lisander Be in your fathers house? Ber. Upon my knowledge he is not there. Alc. I am glad on't. Ber. Why good sir? (Without offence I speake it) there's no place In which he is more honour'd, or more safe, Then with his friend Cleander. Alc. In your votes I grant it true, but as it now stands with him, I can give reason to make satisfaction For what I speake; you cannot but remember The ancient difference between Lisander And Cloridon, a man in grace at Court? Beront. I do; and the foule plot of Cloridons kinsmen Upon Lisanders life, for a fall given to Cloridon 'Fore the King, as they encountred at a solemne tilting. Alcid. It is now reveng'd: In briefe a challenge was brought to Lisander By one Chrysantes; and as far as valour Would give him leave, declin'd by bold Lisander: But peace refus'd, and braves, on braves heap'd on him, Alone he met the opposites, ending the quarrell With both their lives. Ber. I am truely sorry for't. Alc. The King incensed for his favourites death, Hath set a price upon Lisanders head, As a reward to any man that brings it Alive, or dead; to gaine this, every where He is pursu'd, and laid for, and the friendship Between him and your noble brother knowne, His house in reason cannot passe unsearcht, And that's the principall cause that drew me hither, To hasten his remove, if he had chosen This Castle for his sanctuary. Ber. 'Twas done nobly, And you most welcome; this night pray you take A lodging with us; and at my intreaty Conceale this from my brother, he is growne Exceeing sad of late; and the hard fortune Of one he values at so high a rate, Will much encrease his melancholy. Alc. I am tutor'd; pray you lead the way. Ber. To serve you I will shew it. Exeunt. Enter Cleander with a book. Cle. Nothing more certaine then to dye, but when Is most uncertaine: if so, every houre We should prepare us for the journey, which Is not to be put off. I must submit To the divine decree, not argue it, And chearfully I welcome it: I have Dispos'd of my estate, confess'd my sinnes, And have remission from my Ghostly Father, Being at peace too here: the apparition Proceeded not from fancy, Dorilaus Saw it, and heard it with me, it made answer To our demands, and promis'd, if 'twere not Deny'd to him by fate, he would forewarne me Of my approaching end, I feele no symptome Of sicknesse, yet I know not how a dulnesse Invades me all over. Ha? Enter Host. Host. I come sir, To keep my promise; and as farre as spirits Are sensible of sorrow for the living, I grieve to be the messenger to tell you, Ere many houres passe, you must resolve To fill a grave. Cle. And feast the wormes? Host. Even so sir. Clean. I heare it like a man. Host. It well becomes you, there's no evading it. Clean. Can you discover by whose means I must dye? Host. That is deny'd me: But my prediction is too sure; prepare To make your peace with heaven. So farewell sir, Ex. Cle. I see no enemy neare; and yet I tremble Like a pale Coward: my sad doom pronounc'd By this aëriall voice, as in a glasse Shewes me my death in its most dreadfull shape. What rampire can my humane frailty raise Against the assault of fate? I doe begin To feare my selfe, my inward strengths forsake me, I must call out for helpe. Within there? haste, And break in to my rescue. Enter Dorilaus, Caliste, Olinda, Beronte, Alcidon, Servants and Clarinda at severall doores. Dor. Rescue? where? shew me your danger. Cal. I will interpose My loyall breast between you and all hazzard. Ber. Your brothers sword secures you. Alc. A true friend will dye in your defence. Clean. I thanke yee, To all my thanks. Encompass'd thus with friends How can I feare? and yet I doe, I am wounded, Mortally wounded: nay it is within, I am hurt in my minde: One word— Dor. A thousand. Cle. I shall not live to speak so many to you. Dor. Why? what forbids you? Cle. But even now the spirit Of my dead Host appear'd, and told me, that This night I should be with him: did you not meet it? It went out at that doore. Dor. A vaine Chymera Of your imagination: can you thinke Mine Host would not as well have spoke to me now, As he did in the Inne? these waking dreames Not alone trouble you, but strike a strange Distraction in your family: see the teares Of my poore daughter, faire Olinda's sadnesse, Your brothers and your friends griefe, servants sorrow. Good sonne beare up, you have many yeares to live A comfort to us all: let's in to supper; Ghosts never walke till after mid-night, if I may believe my Grannam. VVe will wash These thoughts away with wine, spight of Hobgoblins. Cle. You reprehend me justly: gentle Madam, And all the rest, forgive me, Ile endeavour To be merry with you. Dor. That's well said. Beron. I have procur'd your pardon. Cal. Once more I receive you Into my service: but take speciall care You fall no further. Clar. Never Madam: sir, When you shall finde fit time to call me to it, I will make good what I have said. Ber. Till when, upon your life be silent. Dor. We will have a health unto Lisander. Cle. His name sir Somewhat revives me; but his sight would cure me. How ever let's to supper. Olin. VVould Clarange And Lidian were here too, as they should be, If wishes cou'd prevaile. Cal. They are fruitlesse Madam. Ex. Enter Leon. Leon. If that report speak truth, Clarinda is Discharg'd her Ladies service, and what burthen, I then have drawne upon me is apparent, The crop she reapt from her attendance was Her best Revenue, and my principall meanes Clarinda's bountie, though I labour'd hard for't, A younger brothers fortune: Must I now Have soure sawce after sweet meats? and be driv'n To leavie halfe a Crown a week, besides Clouts, sope, and candles, for my heire apparent, If she prove, as she sweares she is with childe; Such as live this way, finde like me, though wenching Hath a faire face, there's a Dragon in the taile of't That stings toth' quick. I must skulke here, untill I am resolv'd: how my heart pants between My hopes and feares? shee's come; are we in the Port? If not, let's sink together. Enter Clarinda. Clar. Things goe better Then you deserve; you carry things so openly, I must beare every way, I am once more In my Ladies grace. Leon. And I in yours. Clar. It may be; but I have sworne unto my Lady never To sinne againe. Leon. To be surpriz'd—the sinne Is in it selfe excusable; to be taken Is a crime, as the Poet writes. Clar. You know my weaknesse, And that makes you so confident. You have got A faire sword; was it not Lisanders? Leon. Yes wench, And I growne valiant by the wearing of it: It hath been the death of two. With this Lisander Slew Cloridon, and Chrysanthes. I took it up, Broken in the handle, but that is reform'd, And now in my possession; the late Master Dares never come to challenge it: this sword, And all the weapons that I have, are ever Devoted to thy service: Shall we bill? I am very gamesome. Clar. I must first dispose of The foole Malfort; he hath smoak'd you, and is not, But by some new device to be kept from me: I have it here shall fit him: you know where You must expect me, with all possible silence Get thither. Leon. You will follow? Clar. VVill I live? She that is forfeited to lust must dye, That humour being un-fed; begone, here comes Exit Le. My champion in Armour. Ent. Malf. in Armour. Malf. What adventure I am bound upon I know not, but it is My Mistris pleasure that I should appeare thus. I may perhaps be terrible to others, But as I am, I am sure my shadow frights me, The clashing of my Armour in my eares, Sounds like a passing-bell; and my Buckler, puts me In minde of a Beere; this my broad sword a pick-axe To dig my grave: O love, abominable love, What Monsters issue from thy dismall den, Clarinda's placket, which I must encounter, Or never hope to enter? Clar. Here's a Knight errant, Monsieur Malfort. Malf. Stand, stand, or Ile fall for yee. Clar. Know ye not my voice? Malf. Yes, 'twas at that I trembl'd. But were my false friend Leon here— Clar. 'Tis he. Malf. Where? where? Clar. He is not come yet. Malf. 'Tis well for him, I am so full of wrath. Clar. Or feare—This Leon, How 'ere my kinsman, hath abus'd you grossely, And this night vowes to take me hence perforce, And marry me to another: 'twas for this, (Presuming on your love) I did entreat you To put your armour on, that with more safety You might defend me. Mal. And Ile doe it bravely. Clar. You must stand here to beate him off, and suffer No humane thing to passe you, though it appeare In my Lords shape, or Ladies: be not cozen'd With a disguise. Mal. I have been fool'd already, but now I am wise. Car. You must sweare not to stirre hence. Malf. Upon these lips. Clar. Nor move untill I call you? Malf. Ile grow here rather. Clar. This nights taske well ended, I am yours to morrow. Keep sure guard. Exit Clar. Malf. Adiew; My honey-combe how sweet thou art, did not A nest of Hornets keep it? what impossibilities Love makes me undertake? I know my selfe A naturall coward, and should Leon come, Though this were Cannon proofe, I should deliver The wench before he ask'd her. I heare some footing: 'Tis he; where shall I hide my selfe? that is My best defence. Enter Cleander. Cle. I cannot sleep, strange visions Make this poore life, I fear'd of late to lose, A toy that I grow weary of. Malf. 'Tis Leon. Clean. What's that? Mal. If you are come sir for Clarinda; I am glad I have her for you; I resigne My interest; you'll finde her in her chamber, I did stay up to tell you so. Clean. Clarinda, and Leon! There is something more in this Then I can stay to aske. Exit. Malf. What a cold pickle, (And that none of the sweetest) doe I finde My poore selfe in? Clean. speaks within. Yield villaine. Enter Clarinda and Leon, running. Cleander following. Clar. 'Tis my Lord, Shift for your selfe. Leon. His life Shall first make answer For this intrusion. Kills Cleander. Malf. I am going away, I am gone already. Falls in a swoune. Clean. Heaven take mercy on My soule; too true presaging Host. Clar. Hee's dead, And this wretch little better: Doe you stare upon your Handy-work? Leon. I am amaz'd. Clar. Get o're the garden Wall, flye for your life, But leave your sword behinde; enquire not why: Ile fashion something out of it, though I perish, Shall make way for revenge. Leon. These are the fruits Of lust Clarinda. Clar. Hence repenting Milk-sop. Ex. Leon. Now 'tis too late. Lisanders sword, I that, Puts the sword in Malf. hand. That is the base Ile build on. So. Ile raise The house. Help, murther, a most horrid Murther. Monsieur Beronte, noble Dorilaus, All buried in sleep? Aye me a murther: A most unheard-of murther. Enter Dorilaus as from bed. Dor. More lights knaves; Beronte, Alcidon; more lights. Enter Beronte, Alcidon, and Servants, with lights. Clar. By this I see too much. Dor. My sonne Cleander bathing In his owne gore. The devill to tell truth ith' shape of An Host! Ber. My Brother? Malf. I have been Ith' other world, in hell I think, these devills With fire-brands in their pawes sent to torment me, Though I never did the deed, for my lewd purpose To be a whore-master. Dor. Who's that? Alc. 'Tis one in Armour. A bloudy sword in his hand. Dor. Sans question the murtherer. Malf. Who I? you doe me wrong, I never had the heart to kill a Chicken; Nor doe I know this sword. Alc. I doe, too well. Ber. I have seen Lisander weare it. Clar. This confirmes What yester-night I whisper'd: let it worke, The circumstance may make it good. Mal. My Lord? and I his murtherer? Ber. Drag the villaine hence, The Rack shall force a free confession from him. Mal. I am strook dumbe; You need not stop my mouth. Ber. Away with him. Exit with Malf. Enter Caliste and Olinda. Cal. Where is my Lord? Dor. All that Remaines of him lies there: look on this object, And then turne marble. Cal. I am so already, Made fit to be his monument: but wherefore Doe you, that have both life and motion left you, Stand sad spectators of his death, And not bring forth his murtherer? Ber. That lies in you: you must, and shal produce him. Dor. She Beronte? Ber. None else. Dor. Thou ly'st, Ile prove it on thy head, Or write it on thy heart. Alc. Forbeare, there is Too much bloud shed already, Ber. Let not choler Stifle your judgement: many an honest father Hath got a wicked daughter. If I prove not With evident proofes, her hand was in the bloud Of my deare brother, (too good a husband for her) Give your revenge the reines, and spur it forward. Dor. In any circumstance but shew her guilty, Ile strike the first stroak at her. Ber. Let me aske A question calmly: doe you know this sword? Have you not seen Lisander often weare it. Dor. The same with which he rescued me. Cal. I do, What inference from this to make me guilty? Ber. Was he not with you in the house to night? Cal. No on my soule. Ber. Nor ever heretofore In private with you, when you feign'd a sicknesse, To keep your husband absent? Cal. Never sir, to a dishonest end. Ber. Was not this woman Your instrument? her silence does confesse it: Here lyes Cleander dead, and here the sword Of false Lisander, too long cover'd with A masque of seeming truth. Dor. And is this all The proofe you can alleage? Lisander guilty, Or my poore daughter an adulteresse? Suppose that she had chang'd discourse with one To whom she ow'd much more? Cal. Thou hast thy ends, wicked Clarinda. She falls. Oli. Helpe, the Lady sinks, malice hath kill'd her. Dor. I would have her live, Since I dare sweare shee's innocent: 'tis no time Or place to argue now: this cause must be Decided by the Judge; and though a Father, I will deliver her into the hands Of Justice: If she prove true gold when try'd, Shee's mine: if not, with curses Ile disclaime her: Take up your part of sorrow, mine shall be Ready to answer with her life the fact That she is charg'd with. Ber. Sir, I look upon you as on a father. Dor. VVith the eyes of sorrow I see you as a brother: let your witnesses Be readie. Ber. 'Tis my care. Alc. I am for Lidian. This accident no doubt will draw him from His Hermits life. Clar. Things yet goe right, persist sir. Exeunt. Enter Lisander, and Lancelot. Lis. Are the horses dead? Lanc. Out-right. If you ride at this rate, You must resolve to kill your two a day, And that's a large proportion. Lis. Will you please At any price, and speedily, to get fresh ones. You know my danger, and the penalty That followes it, should I be apprehended. Your duty in obeying my commands, Will in a better language speak your service, Then your unnecessary, and untimely care of my expence. Lanc. I am gone sir. Exit. Lisan. In this thicket I will expect you: Here yet I have leisure To call my selfe to a strict account For my pass'd life, how vainly spent: I would I stood no farther guilty: but I have A heavier reckoning to make: This hand Of late as white as innocence, and unspotted, Now weares a purple colour, dy'd in gore, My soule of the same tincture; pur-blinde passion, With flattering hopes, would keep me from despaire, Pleading I was provok'd to it; but my reason Breaking such thin and weak defences, tells me I have done a double murther; and for what? Was it in service of the King? his Edicts Command the contrary: or for my Countrey? Her Genius, like a mourning mother, answers In Cloridon and Chrysanthes she hath lost Two hopefull sonnes, that might have done their parts, To guard her from Invasion: for what cause then? To keep th'opinion of my valour upright, Ith' popular breath, a sandy ground to build on; Bought with the Kings displeasure, as the breac Of heavens decrees, the losse of my true comforts, In Parents, Kinsmen, friends, as the fruition Of all that I was borne to, and that sits Like to a hill of Lead here, in my exile, (Never to be repeal'd, if I escape so) I have cut off all hopes ever to look on Enter Lidian, like a Hermite. Divine Caliste, from her sight, and converse, For ever banish'd. Lid. I should know this voice, His naming too my sister, whom Lisander Honour'd, but in a noble way, assures me That it can be no other: I stand bound To comfort any man I finde distress'd: But to ayd him that sav'd my life, Religion And Thankfulnesse commands, and it may be High providence for this good end hath brought him Into my solitary walke. Lisander, noble Lisander. Lis. Whatsoe're thou art, That honourable attribute thou giv'st me, I can pretend no right to: come not neare me, I am infectious, the sanctity Of thy profession (for thou appearest A reverend Hermite) if thou flye not from me, As from the plague or leprosie, cannot keep thee From being polluted. Lid. With good counsell sir, And holy prayers to boot I may cure you, Though both wayes so infected. You look wildly, Peace to your conscience sir, and stare upon me, As if you never saw me: hath my habit Alter'd my face so much, that yet you know not Your servant Lidian? Lis. I am amaz'd! So young, and so religious? Lid. I purpose (heaven make me thankfull for't) to leave the world: I have made some triall of my strengths in this My sollitarie life; and yet I finde not A faintnesse to goe on. Lis. Above beliefe: doe you inhabit here? Lid. Mine owne free choise sir: I live here poorely, but contentedly, Because I finde enough to feed my fortunes; Indeed too much: these wilde fields are my gardens, The Chrystall Rivers they afford their waters, And grudge not their sweet streams to quench afflictions; The hollow rocks their beds, which thogh they are hard, (The Emblemes of a doting lovers fortune) Yet they are quiet; and the wearie slumbers The eyes catch there, softer then beds of Down friend; The Birds my Bell to call me to devotions; My Book the story of my wandring life, In which I finde more houres due to repentance Then time hath told me yet. Lis. Answer me truely. Lid. I will doe that without a conjuration. Lis. Ith' depth of meditation doe you not Sometimes think of Olinda? Lid. I endeavour To raze her from my memorie, as I wish You would doe the whole Sex, for know Lisander, The greatest curse brave man can labour under, Is the strong witch-craft of a womans eyes; Where I finde men I preach this doctrine to 'em: As you are a Scholler, knowledge make your Mistris, The hidden beauties of the heavens your studie; There shall you finde fit wonder for your faith, And for your eye in immitable objects: As you are a profess'd souldier, court your honour, Though she be sterne, she is honest, a brave Mistris; The greater danger you oppose to win her, She shewes the sweeter, and rewards the nobler; Womens best loves to hers meere shadowes be, For after death she weds your memorie. These are my contemplations. Lis. Heavenly ones; And in a young man more remarkable. But wherefore doe I envy, and not tread in This blessed tract? here's in the heart no falshood To a vow'd friend, no quarrells seconded With Challenges, which answer'd in defence Of the word Reputation, murther followes. A man may here repent his sinnes, and though His hand like mine be stain'd in bloud, it may be With penitence and true contrition wash'd off; You have prov'd it Lidian. Lid. And you'll finde it true, if you persevere. Lis. Here then ends my flight, And here the furie of the King shall finde me Prepar'd for heaven, if I am mark'd to dye; For that I truely grieve for. Enter Frier: and Clarange in Friers habit. Frier. Keep your selfe conceal'd, I am instructed. Clar. How the sight Of my deare friend confirmes me? Lis. What are these? Lid. Two reverend Friers, one I know. Fri. To you This journey is devoted. Lid. Welcome Father. Fri. I know your resolution so well grounded, And your adiew unto the world so constant, That though I am th'unwilling messenger Of a strange accident to trie your temper, It cannot shake you. You had once a friend, A noble friend, Clarange. Lid. And have still, I hope good father. Fri. Your false hopes deceive you, Hee's dead. Lis. Clarange dead? Fri. I buried him. Some said he dy'd of melancholy, some of love, And of that fondnesse perish'd. Lid. O Clarange. Clar. Hast thou so much brave nature, noble Lidian, So tenderly to love thy rivalls memorie? The bold Lisander weeps too. Fri. I expected that you would beare this better. Lid. I am a man sir, and my great losse weigh'd duly— Fri. His last words were After Confession, live long deare Lidian, Possest of all thy wishes; and of me He did desire, bathing my hand with teares, That with my best care, I should seek and finde you, And from his dying mouth prevaile so with you, That you a while should leave your Hermites strictnesse, And on his monument pay a teare, or two, To witnesse how you lov'd him. Lid. O my heart! to witnesse how I lov'd him? would he had not Lead me unto his grave, but sacrific'd His sorrowes upon mine, he was my friend, My noble friend, I will bewayle his ashes, His fortunes and poore mine were born together, And I will weep 'em both: I will kneele by him, And on his hallow'd earth doe my last duties. Ile gather all the pride of spring to deck him, Wood-bines shall grow upon his honour'd grave; And as they prosper claspe to shew our friendship, And when they wither Ile die too. Clar. Who would not Desire to dye, to be bewaild thus nobly? Fri. There is a Legacy he hath bequeath'd you; But of what value I must not discover, Untill those Rites and pious Ceremonies Are duly tender'd. Lid. I am too full of sorrow to be inquisitive Lis. To think of his I doe forget mine owne woes. Enter Alcidon. Alc. Graze thy fill, now Thou hast done thy businesse; ha? who have we here? Lisander, Lidian? and two reverend Friers? What a strange Scene of sorrow is exprest In different postures, in their looks and station? A common Painter eying these, to helpe His dull invention, might draw to the life The living sonnes of Priam, as they stood On the pale walls of Troy, when Hector fell Under Achilles Speare: I come too late, My horse, though good and strong, mov'd like a Tortoise: Ill newes had wings, and hath got here before me. All Pythagoreans? not a word? Lid. O Alcidon— Deep rivers with soft murmures glide along The shallow roare: Clarange! Lis. Cloridon? Chrysanthes? spare my grief, and apprehend What I should speak. Alc. Their fates I have long since For your sake mourn'd; Clarange's death, for so Your silence doth confirme, till now I heard not: Are these the bounds that are prescrib'd unto The swelling seas of sorrow? Lis. The bounds Alcidon? Can all the windes of mischiefe from all quarters, Euphrates, Ganges, Tigris, Volga, Po, Paying at once their tribute to this Ocean, Make it swell higher? I am a murtherer, Banish'd, proscrib'd, is there ought else that can Be added to it? Lid. I have lost a friend, Priz'd dearer then my being, and he dead My misery's at the height contemne the worst Of fortunes malice. Alc. How our humane weaknesse, Growne desperate from small disasters makes us Imagine them a period to our sorrowes, When the first syllable of greater woes Is not yet written. Lid. How? Lis. Speak it at large, Since griefe must break my heart, I am ambitious It should be exquisite. Alc. It must be told, Yet e're you heare it, with all care put on The surest Armour anvil'd in the shop Of passive fortitude; the good Cleander Your friend is murther'd. Lis. 'Tis a terrible pang. And yet it will not doe, I live yet, act not The tortrers part; if that there be a blow Beyond this, give it, and at once dispatch me. Alc. Your sword dyed in his heart-bloud was found near him Your private conference at mid-night urg'd With faire Caliste; which by her whose pure truth, Would never learne to tell a lie, being granted, She by inrag'd Beronte is accus'd Of murther and adulterie, and you (However I dare sweare it false) concluded Her principall agent. Lid. Wave upon wave rowles o're me. My sister? my deare sister? Clar. Hold great heart. Fri. Teare open his Doublet. Lis. Is this wound too narrow For my life to get out at? Bring me to A Cannon loaded, and some pittying friend Give fire unto it, while I nayle my breast Unto his thundring mouth, that in the instant, I may be peece-meale torne, and blowne so far, As not one joynt of my dismember'd limbes May ever be by search of man found out. Cleander! Yet why name I him? however His fall deserv'd an earth-quake, if compar'd With what true honour in Caliste suffers, Is of no moment; my good Angel keep me From blasphemy, and strike me dumb before In th'agony of my spirit, I doe accuse The powers above, for their unjust permission Of vertue, innocent vertue, to be branded With the least vitious marke. Clar. I never saw a man so far transported. Alc. Give it way, 'tis now no time to stop it. Lanc. Sir, I have bought Enter Lancelot. Fresh horses; and as you respect your life Speedily back 'em; the Archers of the Kings guard, Are every where in quest of you. Lis. My life? Perish all such with thee that wish it longer Strikes Lancelot. Let it but cleare Caliste's innocence, And Nestors age to mine was youth, Ile flye To meet the rage of my incensed King, And wish his favourites ghost appear'd in flames, To urge him to revenge, let all the tortures That tyranny ever found out circle me, Provided justice set Caliste free. Ex. Lisander, Alcidon &amp; Lancelot. Alc. Ile follow him. Lid. I am rooted here Fri. Remember your dear friends last request, your sisters dangers, With the aides that you may lend her. Lid. Pray you support me, My legs deny their office. Clar. I grow still Farther engag'd unto his matchlesse vertues, And I am dead indeed, untill I pay The debt I owe him in a noble way. Exeunt.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Actus Quintus. Scæna Prima. Enter Dorilaus, and Servant. Dor. Thou hast him safe? Serv. As fast as locks can make him: He must break through three doores, and cut the throats Of ten tall fellowes, if that hee scape us: Besides, as far as I can apprehend, He hath no such invention, for his looks Are full of penitence. Dor. Trust not a knaves looks, They are like a whores oathes; How does my poore daughter Brook her restraint? Serv. With such a resolution As well becomes your Lordships childe. Knock within. Dor. Who's that? Serv. Monsieur Lemure. Enter Lemur. Dor. This is a speciall favour, And may stand an example in the court For courtesie: It is the Clyants duty To wait upon his patron; you prevent me, That am your humble suter. Lemure. My neare place About the King, though it swell others, cannot Make me forget your worth and age, which may Challenge much more respect; and I am sorry That my endeavours for you have not met with The good successe I wish'd; I mov'd the King With my best advantage both of time and place, Ith' favour of your daughter. Dor. How doe you finde his Majesty affected? Lem. Not to be Sway'd from the rigour of the Law: yet so far The rarity of the cause hath won upon him, That he resolves to have in his owne person The hearing of it; her tryall will be noble, And to my utmost strength, where I may serve her, My aydes shall not be wanting.

Humanity and noblenesse waiting on her Serv. Two gentlemen (but what they are I know not, Their faces are so musl'd) presse to see you, And will not be deny'd. Dor.

My Joy to see you, and my sorrow for The danger you are in, contend so here, Though different passions, nay oppos'd in nature, I know not which to entertaine. Lis. Your hate should win the victorie from both, with justice, You may look on me as a Homicide, A man whose life is forfeited to the Law, But if (how ere I stand accus'd) in thought I sinn'd against Cleanders life, or live Guilty of the dishonour of your daughter, May all the miseries that can fall on man Here, or hereafter circle me. Dor. To me this protestation's uselesse, I embrace you, As the preserver of my life, the man To whom my sonne owes his, with life, his honour, And howsoever your affection To my unhappy daughter, though it were (For I have sifted her) in a noble way, Hath printed some taint on her fame, and brought Her life in question, yet I would not purchase The wish'd recoverie of her reputation, With strong assurance of her innocence Before the King her Judge, with certaine losse Of my Lisander, for whose life, if found, There's no redemption; my excesse of love, (Though to enjoy you one short day would lengthen My life a dozen yeares) boldly commands me, Upon my knees, which yet were never bent, But to the King and heaven, to entreat you To flye hence with all possible speed, and leave Caliste to her fortune. Lis. O blessed Saints, forsake her in afflictiction? can you Be so unnaturall to your owne bloud, To one so well deserving, as to value My safety before hers? shall innocence In her be branded, and my guilt escape Unpunish'd? doe's she suffer so much for me, For me unworthy, and shall I decline (Eating the bitter bread of banishment) The course of justice to draw out a life? (A life? I stile it false, a living death) Which being uncompell'd laid downe will cleare her, And write her name a-new in the faire legend Of the best women? seek not to disswade me. I will not, like a carelesse Poet, spoyle The last act of my Play, till now applauded, By giving the world just cause to say I fear'd Death more then losse of honour, Dor. But suppose heaven hath design'd some Other saving meanes for her deliverance? Lis. Other meanes? that is A mischiefe above all I have groan'd under: Shall any other pay my debt, while I Write my selfe bankrupt? or Caliste owe The least beholdingnesse for that which she On all the bonds of gratitude I have seal'd to, May challenge from me to be freely tender'd? Avert it mercy! I will goe to my grave, Without the curses of my creditors; Ile vindicate her faire name, and so cancell My obligation to her, to the King, To whom I stand accomptable for the losse Of two of his lov'd subjects lives, Ile offer Mine owne in satisfaction, to heaven Ile pay my true repentance, to the times Present, and future, Ile be registred A memorable president to admonish Others, however valiant, not to trust To their abilities to dare, and doe, And much lesse for the aërie words of honour, And false stamp'd reputation to shake off The chains of their religion, and allegeance, The principall means appointed to prefer Societies and Kingdomes. Exit. Dor. Let's not leave him; his mind's much troubled. Alc. Were your daughter free, Since from her dangers his distraction rises His cause is not so desperate for the slaughter Of Cloridon and Chrysanthes, but it may Find passage to the mercy of the King, The motives urg'd in his defence, that forc'd him To act that bloudy Scæne. Dor. Heaven can send ayds, When they are least expected, let us walke, The houre of tryall drawes neare. Alc. May it end well. Exeunt. Enter Olinda and Lidian. Ol. That for my love you should turne Hermit Lidian, As much amazes me, as your report Clarange's dead. Lid. He is so, and all comforts My youth can hope for, Madam, with him buried; Nor had I ever left my cell, but that He did injoine me at his death to shed Some teares of friendship on his Monument, And those last Rites perform'd, he did bequeath you As the best legacie a friend could give, Or I indeed could wish to my embraces. Ol. 'Tis still more strange, is there no foule play in it? I must confesse I am not sorry sir. For your faire fortune; yet 'tis fit I grieve The most untimely death of such a Gentleman, He was my worthy servant. Lid. And for this acknowledgment, if I could prize you at A higher rate I should, he was my friend: My dearest friend. Ol. But how should I be assur'd sir (For slow beleefe is the best friend of truth) Of this Gentlemans death? if I should credit it, And afterward it fall out contrary, How am I sham'd? how is your vertue tainted? Lid. There is a Frier that came along with me. His businesse to deliver you a Letter. From dead Clarange: You shall heare his testimonie. Father, my reverend Father, looke upon him, Such holy men are Authors of no Fables. Enter Clarange (with a Letter writ out) and Frier. Ol. They should not be, their lives and their opinions, Like brightest purest flames should still burne upwards, To me sir? (delivers the Letter. Clar. If you are the faire Olinda— Frier. I doe not like these crosse points. Clar. Give me leave, I am nearest to my selfe. What I have ploted Shal be pursu'd: you must not over-rule me. Ol. Doe you put the first hand to your own undoing? Play to betray your game? Mark but this letter. Lady I am come to claime your noble promise, Reads. If you be Mistris of your word, ye are mine, I am last return'd: your riddle is dissolv'd, And I attend your faith. Your humble servant Clarange. Is this the Frier that saw him dead? Lid. 'Tis he. Clarange on my life: I am defeated: Such reverend habits juggle? my true sorrow For a false friend not worth a teare derided? Fri. You have abus'd my trust. Ol. It is not well, nor like a gentleman. Clar. All stratagems In love, and that the sharpest war, are lawfull, By your example I did change my habit, Caught you in your owne toyle, and triumph in it, And what by policy's got, I will maintaine With valour, no Lisander shall come in again to fetch you off. Lid. His honor'd name Pronounc'd by such a treacherous tongue is tainted, Maintaine thy treason with thy sword? With what Contempt I heare it; in a Wildernesse I durst encounter it, and would, but that In my retired houres, not counterfeited As thy religious shape was, I have learn'd When Justice may determine such a cause, And of such weight as this faire Lady is, Must not be put to fortune, I appeale Unto the King, and he whose wisedome knowes To doe his subjects right in their estates, As graciously with judgement will determine In points of honour. Olin. I'le steere the same course with you. Claran. I'le stand the tryall. Fri. What have you done? or what intend you? Claran. Aske not; I'le come off with honour. Exeunt. Enter Beronte, Clarinda, Malfort, a bar set forth, Officers. Ber. Be constant in your proofes: should you shrinke backe now, Your life must answer it, nor am I safe, My honour being engag'd to make that good Which you affirme. Clarin. I am confident, so dearely I honour'd my dead Lord, that no respect, Or of my Ladies bounties (which were great ones I must confesse) nor of her former life, For while that she was chast, indeed I lov'd her, Shall hinder me from lending my assistance Unto your just revenge—mine owne I meane, aside. If Leon keepe far off enough, all's secure: Lisander dares not come in, modest blushes Parted with me long since, and impudence Arm'd with my hate, unto her innocence shall be The weapon I will fight with now Ber. The racke Being presented to you, you'l roare out What you conceale yet, Mal. Conceale? I know nothing But that I shall be hang'd, and that I looke for, It is my destiny, I ever had A hanging looke; and a wise woman told me, Though I had not the heart to do a deed Worthy the halter, in my youth or age, I should take a turne with a wry mouth and now 'Tis come about: I have penn'd mine owne ballad Before my condemnation, in feare Some rimer should prevent me: here's my Lady? Would I were in heaven, or a thousand miles hence, That I might not blush to looke on her. Enter Dorilaus, Caliste, Olinda. Dor. You behold this preparation, and the enemies Who are to fight against your life, yet if You bring no witnesse here, that may convince ye Of breach of faith to your Lords bed, and hold up Unspotted hands before the King, this tryall You are to undergo, will but refine, And not consume your honour. Cal, How confirm'd I am here, whatsoever Fate falls on me, You shall have ample testimony; till the death Of my deare Lord, to whose sad memory I pay a mourning widdowes teares, I liv'd Too happy in my holy-day trim of glorie, And courted with felicitie, that drew on me, With other helpes of nature, as of fortune, The envie, not the love of most that knew me, This made me to presume too much, perhaps Too proud; but I am humbled; and if now I doe make it apparent, I can beare Adversity with such a constant patience As will set off my innocence, I hope sir, In your declining age, when I should live A comfort to you, you shall have no cause, How e're I stand accus'd, to hold your honour Ship-wrack'd in such a daughter. Ol. O best friend, my honour's at the stake too, for— Dor. Be silent; the King. Enter King, Lemure, and Attendants. Lem. Sir, if you please to look upon The Prisoner, and the many services Her Father hath done for you— King. We must look on The cause, and not the persons. Yet beholding With an impartiall eye, th'excelling beauties Of this faire Lady, which we did beleeve Upon report, but till now never saw 'em, It moves a strange kind of compassion in me; Let us survey you nearer, shee's a book To be with care perus'd; and tis my wonder, If such mishapen ghests, as lust and murther, At any price should ever finde a lodging In such a beauteous Inne! mistake us not, Though we admire the outward structure, if The roomes be foule within, expect no favour. I were no man, if I could look on beautie Distress'd, without some pitty; but no King, If any superficiall glosse of feature Could worke me to decline the course of Justice. But to the cause, Cleander's death, what proofes Can you produce against her? Ber. Royall sir, touching that point my brothers death, We build on suppositions. King. Suppositions? how? Is such a Lady sir to bee condemn'd On suppositions? Ber. They are well grounded sir: And if we make it evident she is guilty Of the first crime we charge her with, Adulterie, That being the parent, it may finde beliefe, That murther was the issue. King. We allow It may be so; but that it may be, must not Inferre a necessary consequence To cast away a Ladies life. What witnesses To make this good? Ber. The principall, this woman, For many yeares her servant; she hath taken Her oath in Court. Come forward. King. By my Crowne a lying face. Clar. I swore sir for the King: And if you are the partie, as I doe Believe you are, for you have a good face, How ever mine appeares, swearing for you sir, I ought to have my oath passe. King. Impudent too? well, what have you sworne? Clar. That this Lady was A goodly tempting Lady, as she is: How thinks your Majestie? and I her servant, Her officer as one would say, and trusted With her closest Chamber-service; that Lisander VVas a fine timber'd gentleman, and active, That he cou'd doe fine gambolls To make a Lady merrie; that this paire, A very loving couple, mutually Affected one another: so much for them sir. That I, a simple waiting-woman, having taken My bodily oath, the first night of admittance Into her Ladiships service, on her slippers, (That was the book) to serve her will in all things, And to know no Religion but her pleasure, 'Tis not yet out of fashion with some Ladies; That I, as the premisses shew, being commanded To doe my function, in conveyance of Lisander to her chamber, (my Lord absent, On a pretended sicknesse) did the feat, (It cannot be deny'd) and at dead mid-night Left 'em together: what they did, some here Can easily imagine? I have said, sir. Dor. The devills Oratrix. King. Then you confesse you were her Bawd? Clar. That's course, her agent sir. King. So goodie agent? and you think there is No punishment due for your agentship? Clar. Let her suffer first, Being my better, for adulterie, And Ile endure the Mulct impos'd on Bawdes, Call it by the worst name. Cal. Live I to heare this? King. Take her aside. Your answer to this Lady? Cal. Heav'n grant me patience: to be thus confronted, (O pardon Royall sir a womans passion) By one, and this the worst of my mis-fortunes, That was my slave, but never to such ends sir, VVould give a statue motion into furie: Let my pass'd life, my actions, nay intentions, Be by my grand accuser justly censur'd, (For her I scorne to answer) and if they Yeeld any probability of truth In that she urges, and I will confesse A guilty cause; the peoples voyce, which is The voyce of truth, my husbands tendernesse In his affection to me, that no dotage But a reward of humblenesse, the friendship Eccho'd through France between him and Lisander, All make against her; for him, in his absence, (VVhat ever imputation it draw on me) I must take leave to speak: 'tis true, he lov'd me, But not in such a wanton way, his reason Master'd his passions: I grant I had At mid-night conference with him; but if he Ever receiv'd a farther favour from me, Then what a sister might give to a brother, May I sinke quick: and thus much, did he know The shame I suffer for him, with the losse Of his life for appearing, on my soule He would maintaine. Enter Lisander, and Alcidon. Lis. And will, thou cleare example of womens purenesse. King. Though we hold her such, Thou hast express'd thy selfe a desperat foole, To thrust thy head into the Lions jawes, The justice of thy King. Lis. I came prepar'd for't, And offer up a guilty life to cleare Hir innocence; the oath she tooke, I sweare to; And for Cleanders death, to purge my selfe From any colour malice can paint on me, Or that she had a hand in't, I can prove That fatall night when he in his own house fell, And many daies before, I was distant from it A long daies journey. Clarin. I am caught. Ber. If so, How came your Sword into this stewards hands? stand forth. Mal. I have heard nothing that you spake; I know I must dye, and what kind of death Pray you resolve me, I shall go away else In a qualme; I am very faint. Enter Leon, Servants, and Guard King. Carry him off, his feare will kil him. Ex. with Mal. Dor. Sir, 'twas my ambition, My Daughters reputation being wounded I'th' generall opinion, to have it Cur'd by a publike triall; I had else Forborne your Majesties trouble: I'le bring forth Cleanders murtherer, in a wood I heard him As I rod sadly by, unto himselfe With some compunction, though this devill had none, Lament what he had done, cursing her lust, That drew him to that bloudy fact. Leon. To lessen The foulenesse of it, for which I know justly I am to suffer, and with my last breath To free these Innocents, I do confesse all; This wicked woman only guilty with me. Clari. Is't come to this? thou puling Rogue, dye thou With prayers in thy mouth; I'le curse the lawes By which I suffer, all I grieve for is, That I dye unreveng'd. Leon. But one word more sir, And I have done; I was by accident where Lisander met with Cloridon, and Crysanthes, Was an eare witnesse when he sought for peace, Nay, begg'd it upon colder tearmes then can Almost find credit, his past deeds considered, But they deafe to his reasons, severally Assaulted him, but such was his good fortune, That both fell under it; upon my death I take it uncompel'd, that they were guilty Of their owne violent ends; and he against His will, the Instrument. Alc. This I will sweare too, for I was not far off. Dor. They have alleadg'd As much to wake your sleeping mercy sir, As all the Advocates of France can plead In his defence. King. The criminall judge shall sentence These to their merits—with mine owne hand Lady I take you from the bar, and do my selfe Pronounce you innocent. Ex. with Leon, and Clarin. All. Long live the King. King. And to confirme you stand high in our favour, And as some recompence for what you have With too much rigour in your triall suffered; Aske what you please, becoming me to grant, And be possest of't. Cal. Sir, I dare not doubt Your royall promise, in a King it is A strong assurance, that emboldens me Upon my humble knees to make my boone Lisanders pardon. Dor. My good Genius did prompt her to it. Lem. At your feet thus prostrate, I second her petition. Alc. Never King Powr'd forth his meocie on a worthyer subject. Ber. To witnesse my repentance for the wrong In my unjust suspition I did both; I joyne in the same suit. Lis. The life you give, Still ready to lay down for your service, Shall be against your enemies imploy'd, Not hazzarded in brawles. All. Mercie dread sir. King. So many pressing me, and with such reasons Moving compassion, I hope it will not Be censur'd levity in me though I borrow In this from justice to relieve my mercie; I grant his pardon at your intercession, But still on this condition; you Lisander, In expiation of your guilt, shall build A monument for my Cloridon, and Crysanthes: And never henceforth draw a Sword, but when By us you are commanded, in defence of The Flower de Luce and after one yeares sorrow For your deare frend, Cleanders wretched fate, Marry Caliste. Ent. Lidian. Lis. On your sacred hand, I vow to do it seriously. Lid. Great sir stay, Leave not your seat of justice, till you have Given sentence in a cause as much important As this you have determined. King. Lidian? Enter Clarange, and Frier Lid. He sir, your humblest subject, I accuse Clarange Of falshood in true friendship at the height; We both were suiters to this Lady, both Injoyn'd one pennance. Clara. Trouble not the King With an unnecessarie repetition Of what the Court's familiar with already. King. Clarange? Dor. With a shaven crowne? Olin. Most strange, Claran. Looke on thy rivall, your late servant Madam, But now devoted to a better Mistris, The Church, whose orders I have tooke upon me: I here deliver up my interest to her; And what was got with cunning as you thought, I simply thus surrender: heretofore, You did outstrip me in the race of friendship, I am your equall now. Dor. A suite soone ended. Claran. And joyning thus your hands, I know both willing, I may do in the Church my Friers Office In marrying you. Lid. The victory is yours sir. King. It is a glorious one, and well set's of Our Scæne of mercy; to the dead we tender Our sorrow, to the living ample wishes Of future happines: 'tis a Kings duty To prove himselfe a father to his Subjects: And I shall hold it if this well succeed, A meritorious, and praise worthy deed.

      <field name="fulltext">Prologue. A story, and a known one, long since writ, Truth must take place, and by an able wit, Foule mouth'd detraction daring not deny To give so much to Fletchers memory; If so, some may object, why then do you Present an old piece to us for a new? Or wherefore will your profest writer be (Not tax'd of theft before) a Plagary? To this he answers in his just defence, And to maintaine to all our Innocence, Thus much, though he hath travel'd the same way, Demanding, and receiving too the pay For a new Poem, you may find it due, He having neither cheated us, nor you; He vowes, and deeply, that he did not spare The utmost of his strengths, and his best care In the reviving it, and though his powers Could not as he desired, in three short howers Contract the Subject, and much lesse expresse The changes, and the various passages That will he look'd for, you may heare this day Some Scænes that will confirme it is a play, He being ambitious that it should be known What's good was Fletchers, and what ill his owne.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Epilogue. Still doubtfull, and perplex'd too, whether he Hath done Fletcher right in this Historie, The Poet sits within, since he must know it, He with respect, desires that you would shew it By some accustomed signe, if from our action, Or his indeavours you meet satisfaction, With ours he hath his ends, we hope the best, To make that certainty in you doth rest. FINIS.</field>
