      <field name="fulltext">SceneâHungary.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT I. SCENE I. Court-yard of Stolberg Castle. Enter Housdorff and Huntsmen. HOUSDORFF. Come on! O'er yonder eastern cliff the dawn Spreads it's first beamsâ'tis time we were abroad. Sound your loud bugles, let the battlements Of Stolberg Castle ring with your acclaim, 'Till ev'ry drowsy inmate start from slumber, To meet the morn upon the mountain top! (The Huntsmen sound. Enter Baron Stolberg. BARON. Welcome, my gallant friends! Why this shews well. What! thou here, Housdorff! Still alert as ever? HOUSDORFF. Aye, my good lord; though time has thinn'd my hair, And over what remains has spread his snow, I still am heart-whole: let the merry horn Give but the note of preparation, And Housdorff still is found among the first. BARON. That's bravely said. Thy heartiness, old man, Makes me forget my age, and think myself Young, as when first thine hand lac'd on my cuirass, To meet the Turk who menac'd our destruction. Those were brave days; but they are gone, and now Life's autumn creeps upon me, my sere leaves Begin to drop apace, and nought remains To cheer my closing scene, but the fond hope Of my lov'd Ida's future happiness. HOUSDORFF. That seems beyond a doubt. Train'd up by you With more than father's careâ BARON. Hold, my good friend; That is a string which jars whene'er 'tis touch'd. I was indeed a father; these moist eyes Once look'd upon a son; these feeble arms Held out my heir to my surrounding vassals, Their future leaderâ HOUSDORFF. Blisters on my tongue, For thus renewing recollections So hostile to your peace! Yet, sooth to say, He was a lovely boy. BARON. He was my pride: But that was humbled to the dust. These walls, Those wide domains, which from a splendid race Of gallant ancestors devolv'd on me, Will never own the sway of my descendants; My very name must perishâ HOUSDORFF. Nay, my lord, From the alliance you're about to form Between Count Rodolph and your lovely niece It long may live. BARON. I have no other hope. But truce with these reflections. Mark! the sun Climbs o'er yon eastern hill, and mocks our slowness. Let your loud bugles once more hail the day, And call our ling'ring bridegroom from his couch. (The Huntsmen sound their bugles, and exeunt with Housdorff). Enter Ida. My Ida! welcome. Why, my girl, thou look'st Like Dian's self, when on Taygetus' brow She led her sportive train to chase the deer That browz'd on it's green summits. By my faith, Lord Rodolph does thee wrong, my lovely girl, To be thus tardy, when his ev'ry moment, His ev'ry thought, should be ingross'd by thee. IDA. Nay, my good lord, you tax him much too highly. Your humble Ida has no right to claim Th' exclusive homage which, long e'er he knew her, He had devoted to a worthier object. BARON. What's that you say? A worthier object? IDA. Aye, One whose perfections he with pride confesses, On whom he doats, on whose deserts his tongue Grows eloquentâ BARON. Indeed! Who is this rival? IDA. And don't you really know? Can't you discover, 'Tis my lord Rodolph's self? BARON. Hey?âhow?âhis self? Well, thou'rt a merry girlâyet, on my life, I thought thou wast in earnest. IDA. So I am: Look at himâhear him speakâat home, abroad, To whom are his attentions paid?âHimself! Whose teeth, whose shape, whose elegance and taste Doth he e'er deign to notice, but his own? Whose repartees does he repeat? His own! Whose ease does he consult? His own, his own! At once his idol and his idol's priest, At his own shrine he offers sacrifice, With purer adoration than to heav'n. BARON. No more of this, I pray. It passes jest. He is a nobleman of high desert, Much favour'd by his prince, whom I have chosen To join with thee in all my rich succession. I have no son, my love, and would adopt him To comfort my old age, and share thy task Of filial tenderness. IDA. I would my heart Could ratify the vow my tongue must utter. BARON. Why what is this? The match is excellent. IDA. I cannot bring myself to like him, sir; There is a something indescribable, At which my heart revolts whene'er I think I am to call him husband. BARON. Here's a turn! IDA. I do beseech you, sir, compel me notâ BARON. Refuse a nobleman like him!âI love you, You know I doâ IDA. If you did love me, sir, You'd not condemn me thus to misery. BARON. Was the like ever heard? Heav'n grant me patience! I tell you he's a fitting matchâBut hush! See where the Count approaches. Enter Count Rodolph. Why, my lord, You're tardy this fine morning. Heard you not Our merry bugles summon you a field, To try the covers, ere the early dew Had left the tainted grass? RODOLPH. Why yes, my lord, I heard them, quite as much as I desir'd. If this be your idea of amusement, To let a braying post-horn interrupt One's morning slumbers, I protest that I Would rather be excus'd from sharing it. 'Tis strangely gothic! BARON. As your lordship pleasesâ There's no accounting for these diff'rences In gentlemen's opinions. But the chace Has ever been esteem'd war's truest emblem, The school in which the youthful soldier learns The rudiments of that sublime profession Which leads him on to fame. RODOLPH. So much the worse. It is a bad apprenticeship, my lord, To a worse trade. BARON. What can your lordship mean? I'm at a loss to comprehendâWhy now, You are yourself a soldier. Pray how come Your theory and practice thus at variance? RODOLPH. There are some things, my lord, which all who bear A certain rank in life are forc'd to do. No gentleman, who values reputation, Can decline serving. 'Tis as much the fashion, As the pelisse or boot. BARON. Is it indeed? 'Tis lucky that the mode takes such a turn. But come, my lordâmethinks you might as wellâ That is, if fashion don't prohibit itâ Take some small notice of your future bride. RODOLPH. My lady Ida! I protest I did not See you before. Who could expect you here? And in this garb too, Amazonian quite, And arm'd as if for battle. IDA. Aye, my lord, Equipp'd as suits a huntress. Follow me, And I'll engage to shew you some diversion. RODOLPH. Follow you, ma'am? I vow I'm petrified. A lady of your sort thus to unite With low plebeians in their barb'rous sports!â Nay, ma'm, I'm serious. Give me leave to tell you, Lord Rodolph's brideâ IDA. And give me leave, my lord, To tell you, that, as I'm not yet your bride, You have no right to chide me. When I am, Humanity and sense should teach you better. I ask your pardon if I make too free, But long indulgence here perhaps has spoilt me. I am a strange wild girl, but I may learn, Provided my instructor pleases me. BARON. Aye, I'll be sworn thou wilt.âBut comeâwe lose Our time. By this, our scouts have driv'n the wood. Conduct your bride, my lord. Our steeds are ready. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Interior of the Banditti's Cavern. At the farther end, a Stair descending from a Trap-door. Enter Finck, Gortz, and another. FINCK (throwing down a bundle). Soâlie thou there.âCome, cast your burthens downâ Our trade grows hardly worth the following. One might, for any reasonable hope Of profit, turn an honest man and work. GORTZ. Why truly, master Finck, considering The wheel and gallows stare us in the face, Our gains are of the smallest. I remember When, in a morning's ramble through the forest, A gentleman might easily bring home A decent bootyâhalf a dozen purses, A watch or soâ FINCK. I tell thee, master Gortz, The public's in confed'racy to cheat us. But let 'em look to itâI know a trick Or two to make us even. Enter Arnold. ARNOLD. What! so soon Return'd? I look'd not for you these two hours. Where did you leave your comrades? FINCK. When we came To the old oak, where the two roads branch off, The morning broke. Myself, with Gortz and Carl, Agreed to take the western range; but, spite Of all our trouble, we could meet with nothing But a poor pedlar and a scurvy priest, Who hardly paid our pains in stripping them. If all they had will bring us in five ducats, I'll suffer the strappado.âThereâlook at itâ (A bugle from without. ARNOLD. Hark! 'tis our comrades' signal. FINCK. They come back too? Swartz and other Banditti descend. ARNOLD. You're welcome, gentlemen. What news do ye bring? SWARTZ. The worst that gentlemen like us can bring. We've had our labour for our pains. ARNOLD. How so? SWARTZ. The devil must have ow'd us an old grudge, And paid it off to-day with interest. All seem'd to promise us a fair campaign; The morn was fine and clear, the roads were good, And passengers in plenty might be look'd for. We rode on in high spirits, when at distance We saw a mighty troop, and heard the horns And shouts of hunters. Suddenly we halted, And Hugo singly rode to reconnoitre. They prov'd the Baron Stolberg and his suite. He treats some nobles with a hunting match Here in the forest. This being known, 'twas clear We had no bus'ness there; so we came back. ARNOLD. Where's Herman? SWARTZ. Far enough ere this, I warrant. Instead of turning homewards, he preferr'd To make one in the chace. ARNOLD. To join the chace? The very dress he wore would cause discov'ry. SWARTZ. I guess'd you'd say so; but he had a trick To pass unnotic'd 'mong 'em. We had chanc'd To meet, ere broke the day, a peasant youth, Drest in his gayest suit, as he inform'd us, To meet his bride at the next parish church. We let him go to keep his assignation, After we'd stript him of his finery. I laugh whene'er I think on't. ARNOLD. Wellâproceed. SWARTZ. When Herman took a fancy to remain, I counsell'd him to doff his uniform, And take the bridegroom's suit. No sooner said Than done. Egad! the change became him well, And look'd more natural for a lad like him, Than our buff jerkin. FINCK. Trueâfor a young fellow Brought up to th' trade, and born as 'twere among us, I never met his equal for the lack Of all that's needful for our noble calling. ARNOLD. Nay, Finck, I pray you speak not of him thus. Remember he's my brother, and a youth Of high and rare endowments. FINCK. Noble captain, I meant no harm; but, by Saint Anthony, He bears no likeness to the family. Why now, there was your fatherâhe was captain When first I join'd the troop. A bolder fellow No troop in Hungary could boast. And then As for yourself, whom, on his death, we chose To be our leader, we have no objections To make against you. ARNOLD. No? FINCK. No, none to speak of. When you were private in the troop, you took Your fair proportion of the toil and danger, And now you're captain, why you do your duty, And keep up discipline. But as for Herman, He may be well enough perhaps for courage, But, truly, my young sir is pitiful, And feels compunctionsâ ARNOLD. Nay, sirâ FINCK. If a fellow Resist us, or refuse to give his purse, When by the laws of war we're warranted To knock him on the head, he'll let him go, And preach against the sinfulness of murder. Your father should have made a priest of him, For he can ne'er do credit to our order. ARNOLD. Give o'er these tauntsâ'tis sign you know him not, Nor can appreciate merit such as his. Nay, silence, sir! no man shall dare asperse His character, while my hand wields a sword. SWARTZ. I pray you, noble captain, be appeas'd. (To Finck) Must it be ever so?â(to Arnold)âWhat say you, captain, Shall we adjourn to th' refectory? The keen air Has giv'n me appetite. FINCK. Your pardon, captain. ARNOLD. No more.âCome, gentlemen, a gen'rous glass Will make you think less of your disappointment. (To Finck) Your handâin a full brimmer you shall pledge me To Herman's pleasant chace and safe return. [Exeunt. SCENE III. The Forest. Enter Baron Stolberg, Count Rodolph, Housdorff, and Hunters. HOUSDORFF. This way, my lordsâyour horses are at hand, Ready to mount if wanted. BARON. Are you sure The lady Ida is securely plac'd? She's mounted on a courser of high spirit, And, when the game is started, he may take Some little liberties. Enter a Huntsman. HUNTSMAN. My lord, all's readyâ We have dislodg'd a boar from yonder coverâ The hounds are now at bay. BARON. Set forward then! Come on, my lord, we'll shew you glorious sport! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Another Part of the Forest. Enter Herman. HERMAN. Thus far auspiciously I've held my course, Thanks to this borrow'd garb, whose honest shew Is more in unison with Herman's feelings Than that to which harsh fate has destin'd him. Thank heav'n! I've gain'd a temporary freedom, Can view the glorious sun, without a blush To think myself unworthy of his beams. Now may my cherish'd wish be gratified. I've read of knights and deeds of martial prowess, 'Till my whole soul was fir'd: now may I see Their vaunted worth exemplified in him, Who o'er these precincts holds his princely sway. Where art thou, gallant Stolberg! Vainly still I've track'd thee by the distant bugle's sound. Oh that propitious fortune had but made me The meanest vassal who fills up thy train! Then from thy bright example might my soul Have caught a kindred feeling, and aspir'd To emulate the glory which inflames it.â Hark! hark! again the peal beginsâand now It louder grows, mix'd with the cheering cry Of men and dogs.âWhat's that?âA piercing shriek As if of sudden anguish!âThere againâ Immortal pow'rs! what see I?âA young female, With hair disshevell'd, fruitlessly attempting To rein a fiery steed, who hurries her Tow'rds yon precipitous and fatal gulphâ Aid me, ye pow'rs! I fly to succour her! [Exit. SCENE V. Another Part of the Forest. Enter Herman bearing Ida. HERMAN. She breathes! she lives! oh! for some friendly spring, Whose freshness may restore suspended life!â See where one trickles from the rock!âPure liquid! Thus on a purer form I sprinkle thee. She movesâagain the circulating blood Revisits her pale cheeks.âBright excellence! For surely charms like thine ne'er met the glance Of wond'ring mortalâwhile suspended yet Thy vital pow'rs, while thou canst not behold And chide my fond presumption, let me kneel, And pay thee bounden adoration. [He kneels. IDA. Ah me! Where am I?âWho art thou, young stranger, And wherefore kneel'st thou? HERMAN. Lady, I am one By far too humble to boast other merit, Than that of having sav'd thee from destruction. IDA. Oh! was it thou?âThe soul-appalling scene Now rushes on my mem'ry. I had perish'd, But for thy timely aid. Tell me thy name. The Baron Stolberg has a heart to feel The merits of his niece's brave preserver. HERMAN. The Baron Stolberg! Art thou then that Ida, Whose beauties form the theme of ev'ry tongue? Thou must! none else can arrogate resemblance To nature's primest work!âForgive me, madam, If I presume too far. My humble wish Soars not beyond the hope that I may live In thy remembrance: more befits not him, Who, though he dare to gaze on thy perfection, Feels conscious of his own unworthiness. IDA. Thy mien, thy bearing, ev'ry word, proclaim Thou art not what thou seem'st. A peasant's son Cannot inherit sentiments like thine. I pray thee tell me who thou art? I ask not From curiosity, but from a wish To know the name of one, whose high desert I've had such cause to appreciate. HERMAN. Noble lady, I cannot speak my name or my condition. I pray thee ask not why.âThere is a cause Too forcibleâ IDA. If there be such a cause, Whate'er my wish to know you, I respect it Too much to press upon you; but I trust A time may comeâ HERMAN. Never, I fear! IDA. Why so? If the cause spring not from disgrace or guilt, Time may remove it. That, your modest valour, And your ingenuous countenance forbid E'en to suppose. HERMAN. Oh spare, in pity spare me! I must notâcannotâI beseech your pardonâ I mean not to offendâ IDA. Indeed you do not. I am indebted to you, sir, far more Than words can ever pay; promise me then You will not always thus conceal yourself. When in due time you may reveal your name, Honour, I pray, our castle with your presence. Meantime, sir, from my finger take this ring; Wear it as a pledge of Ida's gratitude, And, when you look upon it, think of her. HERMAN. From Ida's hand a pledge! 'Fore heav'n! I swear I'll wear it ever as a sacred charm To guide me on to honour. Yes, fair maid! I will obey thee. When I dare approach Thy blest abode, I shall not need concealment. But who are these approaching? IDA. They are friends, Doubtless in search of me. HERMAN. You then are safe. I may not stay to meet them. Gracious lady! If ever thy remembrance light upon me, Let pity for my fortunes mingle with it. Farewell! may angels guard thee! [Exit. IDA. Gallant youth! How sweetly, but how mournfully he spoke! I must know more of himâ Enter Housdorff and Hunters. HOUSDORFF. Thank heav'n, you're found! And safe I hope, and well. IDA. I am. But say, Where is my uncle? HOUSDORFF. He is near at hand. He was exceedingly alarm'd. The Countâ IDA. Did he attempt to succour me? HOUSDORFF. No, ma'am, He's yonder with my lord, but he bad us Set out in search of you. IDA. I thank him for't. Could not a spark of gallant feeling touch That heart, insensible to all but self? It was not thus my brave deliv'rer acted. Heav'ns, what a contrast! HOUSDORFF. Will it please you, madam, To join my lord? He anxiously expects you. IDA. He's always kind.âI'm ready.âShew the way. [Exeunt. END OF ACT I.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT II. SCENE I. An Apartment in Stolberg Castle. Enter Baron Stolberg and Agatha. BARON. Well, Agatha, how fares your mistress now? AGATHA. Please your good lordship, she is much recover'd, Thanks to Saint Bridget for it, and the saints Who sav'd her precious life. Now blessings on her! Would your good lordship think it? When I wish'd her To take a posset of my own preparing, And try to sleep an hour or so, in order To quiet and compose her troubled spirits, As I'm a sinner, 'stead of heeding me, She bad me bring her robeâyour lordship knows itâ The white and silver which your lordship gave herâ It does become her mainly, that's the truth on'tâ BARON. I am right glad to hear it. 'Tis a sign She has not suffer'd from her accident. AGATHA. No, the good saints be prais'd, I'll warrant me. For my part I'd have sworn, to look at her, Instead of running risksâI vow it makes me Shudder whene'er I think on'tâshe had met With something to amuse her. 'Stead of moping, And looking sad, and sighing, as, poor thing! She has done of late, I know not why I'm sure, She has got such a fresh colour in her cheeks, Which comes and goes so prettily, and her eyes So sparkleâBut I vow I had forgotâ I've such a memory!âMy lady charg'd me To pay her humble duty to your lordship, And ask admittance to your lordship's presence. BARON. Why truly, Agatha, thou hast the knack Of expeditiously obeying orders. Try if thou can'st as nimbly hie thee back, And certify my niece I wish to see her. No ceremony, pray theeâI dispense With courtesiesâthereâget thee gone, and do it. [Exit Agatha. Thank heav'n, she has not suffer'd!âI have plac'd My single stake of hope on this dear child, And, if I lose her, I must lose my all. Well! I have match'd her to my heart's content: The Count indeed has rather the advantage In point of years; had he been somewhat younger It had not been amiss; she might perhaps Have lik'd him better; and, it must be own'd He has a few particularities, A kind of cold formality about him, Not captivating. To speak truth of him, He is the coolest bridegroomâSo, my Ida! Enter Ida. Tell me, my dearest, how was't you escap'd? IDA. Oh, sir! the mere idea still appals me. When from his cover by the hounds arous'd The boar rush'd forth, my courser starting mock'd My feeble force, and with the light'ning's speed Bore me across the plain, and up the steep, Which with precipitous descent o'erhangs The farther wood. Death, cloath'd in tenfold horrors, Seem'd seated on it's brow, prepar'd to seize me; And doubtless I had perish'd, had not heav'n In mercy sent a guardian angel downâ BARON. Egad! your history commences well. No wonder you escap'd. Perhaps, however, We may attribute your deliverance To means less supernatural. But go on. I wish to hear some more of this good angel; Who knows but he may prove some old acquaintance. What did he look like? Did you notice him? IDA. His garb betoken'd him a peasant swain, But how unlike the rustics who surround us! In form, activity and grace he seem'd The model of what fabling poets sing Of swains in Arcady. His auburn hair In wanton ringlets play'd across his brow, The rose of health bloom'd on his ruddy cheek, From his dark eyes an emanation beam'd Of more than mortal radianceâ BARON. On my word, If your description flatter not, he was Something worth looking at. I know not where Among our hinds to find his parallel. IDA. Oh, sir! indeed I do not flatter him; He's all I tell you. Judge then what I though him, When, heedless of all risk, he forward rush'd, And, on the precipice's dizz'ning ridge, Whence at the moment headlong fell my steed, He caught me in his succouring arms and sav'd me. BARON. He was indeed a gallant youth.âGo on. IDA. Terror had lock'd my senses in a swoon; But soon as they return'd, I felt myself Safely reposing on a mossy bank, While, at respectful distance, my preserver Knelt, as if rapt in sacred extacy, His fine eyes fix'd on me, and his stretch'd hands Rais'd as in silent gratitude to heav'n. He spoke not, but methought his modest silence Had more of eloquence than words could give. BARON. Why certainly, my love, there are occasions When silence says the most. IDA. I thought so, sir: But, when I spoke to him, and gave him thanks For his most timely service, had you heard With what ingenuous grace he answer'd me, How gallantly he strove to under-rate His own deservings, you'd have thought his life Had all been past in courts, so dignified, So polish'd were his manners and his phrase. You'd have been charm'd with him: I'm sure you would. BARON. If he be such as you describe him, love, I know not but I might. I long to learn More of this gallant youth. What is his name? IDA. That, sir, I cannot tell you. BARON. No! Why not? IDA. I told him you'd be anxious to discover Who had conferr'd such obligation on meâ BARON. Most certainly. IDA. I therefore pray'd he would Disclose himself. BARON. Wellâwhat said he? IDA. He said He could not. BARON. No?âPray did he tell you why? IDA. He said he had a cause for keeping silence, But what that cause was he declin'd to say. 'Twas something which I'm sure must trouble him, For, when he mention'd it, he look'd so sad, It griev'd me to behold him. BARON. It seems strange A peasant should have mystery about him. IDA. From all he said, I could not but conjecture He was not what his mean exterior shew'd. There was an air of nobleness about him, A grace and eleganceâ BARON. Odso! I have it. Handsome he was, you say? IDA. Yes, very handsome. BARON. His mien and manners elegant, his phrases Refin'd and polish'd? Ten to one, my girl, He's some young nobleman, who, to avoid The consequence of an affair of honour, Has in a peasant's garb fled to these mountains. IDA. It isâit must be as you say. BARON. I've known The very same thing happen; nay, when I Wounded my foe Count Walstein in a duel, I quitted Presburg for a time, and grew A sojourner in lonely woods and forests. But I had not the luck, like our young champion, To succour damsels in distress, nor can I Flatter myself I look'd like an Adonis. IDA. The more I think of it, the more I'm sure You've guess'd him rightly. BARON. Child, I know the world. A gentleman, disguise him as you will, Must soon be known. Enter Count Rodolph. Oh, Count! I'm glad you're come. I wish'd to see you. RODOLPH. With your lordship's leave, I would inquire of lady Ida's health. I hope, ma'am, you're recover'd, that your fright Has not too much affected your poor nerves. IDA. My nerves are much indebted to your lordship. I hope your own exertions to protect me Have not much ruffled yours. RODOLPH. Exertions, madam? IDA. How gen'rous 'tis so quickly to forget Your chivalrous behaviour. RODOLPH. Really, madam, IâIâthat isâpray what could I have done? IDA. I know a person who could tell you. RODOLPH. Aye? Who is the gentleman? BARON. That's what we wish Ourselves to learn. From her description of him, There's ground to think him other than he seems. RODOLPH. The case of many others. Pray how seems he? BARON. A peasant swain. RODOLPH. I'm thankful to you, madam, For your intended compliment.âA peasant Instruct me? And in what, I beg to know. IDA. In gallantry, my lord; perhaps in more. RODOLPH. Your ladyship has a privilege to speakâ But really there's a harshness and a force In what you're pleas'd to sayâ BARON. She's rather flurried By her late accident; and 'tis no wonder She strongly feels the services of one To whom she is indebted for her life. I was devising what we can do for him. RODOLPH. 'Tis plain. There is but one way of repaying Such obligations to such vulgar fellows. IDA. Such vulgar fellows!âPray, my lord, what right Have you to term him so? RODOLPH. Ma'am, I conceive My phrase was quite correct. A boor, a clown, Is, ever was, and ever will be class'd Among the vulgar herd. IDA (aside). Presumptuous coxcomb! There's no enduring him.âTo the Baron.)âWith your permission I will withdraw. RODOLPH. What! is your ladyship About to leave us? May I have the honour Of your fair hand? IDA. My lord, I can dispense With your attendance. [Exit. RODOLPH. This is mighty strange! BARON. You must forgive th' effect of agitation. She means no harm, believe me. RODOLPH. To refuse My service! BARON. Psha! 'Twas nothing, I assure you. We must pass over twenty things like this. RODOLPH. My lord, there's such a thing as etiquette. BARON. I'm mighty sorry for itâ'tis a thing Which might be well dispens'd with. RODOLPH. How, my lord? BARON. Come, comeânay, never mind this small fracas. Let us walk through th' apartments, and inspect How far our preparations are advanc'd. [Exeunt. SCENE II. Interior of the Banditti's Cavern. Enter Arnold. ARNOLD. Would Herman were return'd! Howe'er disguis'd, Discov'ry may ensue. I marvel not His inborn feelings thus should work on him To seek emancipation from the crew Of wretches who surround usâhark! his signalâ Enter Herman from the Trap-door. Hast thou partaken of the Baron's sport? HERMAN. No! ARNOLD. Thou'rt unfortunate. HERMAN. Unfortunate! Call him unfortunate, who from the gloom Of a dark dungeon mounts a princely throne! Lament his fate, who from the torturing rack Of stern inquisitors is borne to heav'n! My triumph's greater far than theirs, my labours More glorious, and my bliss more exquisite. Brother! these arms have grasp'd an angel's form; These eyes have gaz'd on more than human charms, And in my soul are lodg'd a seraph's words! ARNOLD. Prithee be more compos'd. HERMAN. Impossible! Composure suits not with a bliss like mine. A tide of transport rushes on my heart, My blood's on fire, my brain turns round with joy!â Dost see?â(shewing the Ring.) ARNOLD. A diamond, lustrous as the sun. HERMAN. Nor sun, nor all the heav'nly luminaries Can match her brilliancy who plac'd it there. ARNOLD. Was it a woman's gift? HERMAN. Aye, such a woman, As may dispute the palm of loveliness With rival goddesses, and win the prize. I saw her hurried by her fiery steed To the steep verge of a deep precipice, Wherein to fall was death. Heav'n gave me speed To outstrip her courser and to save her. Oh! How sweet, how heav'nly was her smile, when first She call'd me her deliv'rer! It pervaded My whole existence; to my inmost soul I felt it's genial influence. Oh my brother! Cull ev'ry beauty which rich nature knows, Add ev'ry charm imagination pictures, Still will she far transcend them all! ARNOLD. Who? HERMAN. Ida! Ida of Stolberg! ARNOLD. (aside). Stolberg! gracious heav'n! What may this tend to?â(To Herman.)âDid I hear thee rightly? Ida of Stolberg? HERMAN. Yes, my Arnold, sheâ The paragon of female excellence, The day-star of my hopeâ ARNOLD. Hath she then giv'n you hope? HERMAN. Ayeâbut 'tis such As the wreck'd seaman feels, when o'er his bark The wild waves beat, and 'twixt the land and him The boist'rous surges lash th' impervious rocks. She deign'd to bid me think of herânay moreâ She call'd me her preserver, glorious name! And said she never, never would forget me. She bad me visit herâ ARNOLD. And wilt thou? HERMAN. Can Iâ Can Herman, the vile inmate of this cavern, Th' associate of banditti, visit her? ARNOLD. Noânot the bandit Herman, not the inmate Of this detested cavernâ(aside)âHow it wrings My heart with anguish to behold him thusâ (To Herman) Hermanâ(aside)âBut holdâit may not be. HERMAN. What mean'st thou? ARNOLD. I have been thinking, Herman, if indeed Th' impression made upon thy feeling heart Be such as time or absence cannot change, Means may be found to raise thee to a level With her, who now seems so far rais'd above thee. HERMAN. Nay, feed me not with visionary hope. ARNOLD. I mean it not. Though fate appear to have plac'd A barrier 'twixt thy tow'ring hopes and thee, The world is ample; there are paths enough On its wide surface that conduct to honour. Thou hast a soldier's fortune, thy good sword: Seek some more distant, more propitious shore, Where as a stranger thou may'st win renown, And prove thyself deserving of her love. HERMAN. There's magic in the sound! The glorious thought Fills my whole soul, and goads me on to action. ARNOLD. Set forth. Where'er thy destiny may lead thee, True to the bonds which knit our kindred souls, Thy brother will be partner in thy fortunes; With thee will he abjure these haunts of guilt, Wash out the stain, which hath too long debas'd The once illustrious name his lineage bore, And re-assert the honours of his race. HERMAN. Thanks, my best brother!âyesâwe'll go together. Methinks already from my lab'ring bosom A mountain is remov'd; my heart beats freely, Through my whole frame with renovated vigour My life-blood flows, already float before me Visions of glory and propitious love!â When shall our vent'rous course commence? To-morrow? ARNOLD. To-dayâthis hour. HERMAN. Agreed. But let me first Revisit Stolberg's precinct, thus disguis'd, If haply I may catch a parting glance Of my soul's empress! 'Twould methinks inspire me With new-born ardour for our enterprize. ARNOLD. Away thenâbut conceal thyself I pray; Breathe not suspicion of thy present state, But, hap what may, preserve thy secret.âSwear it. HERMAN. I swear. ARNOLD. Go then, and heav'n thy progress speed! [Exeunt severally. SCENE III. A Bower in the Castle Garden. Enter Ida, followed by Count Rodolph. IDA. My lord, I pray you follow me not thus. I would be private. RODOLPH. Nay, fair lady, hear me. IDA. Not now. There are occasions better suitedâ RODOLPH. What can suit better for a lover's purpose Than this sequester'd bow'r?âBy this fair handâ IDA. What means this freedom, sir? RODOLPH. Why thus obdurate? IDA. My lord, I do implore you leave me. RODOLPH. How! Leave you? IDA. I would be mistress of my thoughts And of myself. RODOLPH. Allow me, ma'am, to tell you, No lady but yourself could have the pow'r To make me stoop to supplicate an audience. IDA. My lord, 'tis a pre-eminence I court not. RODOLPH. Permit me to observe, those scornful airs Are misapplied. Count Rodolph is a man Who feels his dignityâ IDA. I would he were As fully sensible of the respect Due to a woman's feelings. RODOLPH. I presume You have forgotten, madam, that to-morrow Gives me a husband's rightâ IDA. I know no right To-morrow can confer, which justifies The threat those words convey. But know, my lord, Whatever claims to-morrow may bring with it, To-day I'm mistress of myself. Your lordship Is too well-bred to need another hint. RODOLPH. Yes, haughty madam, yes, I understand you. 'Tis now your turn. But, madam, recollect To-morrowâthen my turn will come. You see I can give hints too.âSo, 'till then, farewell! [Exit. IDA. Thank heav'n, he's gone!âWas ever such assurance? A thing like him to threaten, talk of rights! It was not such a mockery of man, Who at the peril of his life sav'd mine. No, bravest of thy sex, and, since none witness My fond confession, save the heav'nly spirits Who read my thoughtsâthe loveliestâthe most lov'd! Oh! say, why should'st thou veil thy high desert, Why thus in rude concealment shroud the worth, Which might adorn and dignify a throne! Enter Herman. HERMAN. Lady, if once againâ IDA. How! my deliverer! HERMAN. If I deserve that title, I possess Honour more vast than monarchs can bestow. Ah loveliest of thy sex! to see thee thus, To think my arm contributed to save Thy matchless beauties from impending fate, Is in itself a pleasure so extatic, I hardly dare to wish for more. And yet There is a boon I fain would craveâ IDA. If't be Within my pow'r, command it. HERMAN. Lady, do not Deem me too bold, if, when my soul is fill'd With ardour to deserve thy fair opinion, I crave thy leave thus, in the sight of heav'n, To dedicate myself to thy blest service: That, by thy pow'rful influence sustain'd, Success may crown my efforts, and return me More worthy of thy favour. When I'm goneâ IDA. When thou art gone!âAh! wherefore would'st thou go? HERMAN. To cast away the slough, that now defiles Whate'er of good is in me; to become Such as a man of honour ought to be. IDA. I understand you, sir; I now perceive That I conjectur'd rightly. Thou art not What thy exterior shews, a peasant swain. HERMAN. I am not. IDA. What then, sir, is thy condition? HERMAN. I'm for the present bound to secrecy. A time may comeâ IDA. This is the only timeâ Ere this to-morrow, faith, religion, duty Will doom me never to behold thee more. HERMAN. What fatal myst'ry lurks beneath those words? IDA. Another then will have a claim upon meâ A husband's claimâ HERMAN. Support me, heav'nly pow'rs! A husband, say'st thou?âOh recal that word! Rack not my tortur'd heart!âBy heav'n! 'twere mercy To die thus at thy feet, rather than live, And see thee wedded to another! IDA. Riseâ This is no time in vain disguise to lose The only moments I may call mine own.â Thou'st said thou'rt not a peasant swainâ HERMAN. I have. IDA. I do believe thee firmly. What thy rank, And who thou art, thou'st cause not to reveal? HERMAN. I'm bound to secrecy by a firm promise. IDA. Conjecture then is free. I've found thee noble, And I will think thee all that I would have thee. Know then, I'm menac'd with a fate more cruel Than that from which thy valour rescued me. To-morrow sees me wedded to a man Whom my whole soul detests. Alone, defenceless, My only guardian resolute to force An union so repugnant to my feelings, I brood o'er my distresses 'till distraction To desperation points. Perhaps I wrong My sex's honour and mine own, when thus, Impell'd by dire necessity, I breathe The secret of my heart; but thou'rt too noble To abuse my confidence. HERMAN. All I can boast Are honour and untainted faith. IDA. Ah! think not Too lightly of me, if I pass beyond The rigid bound of female delicacy. Could'st thou but know what passes in this bosom, Thy gallant nature would again incite thee To save me from a fateâ HERMAN. Tell me the meansâ My soul, my ev'ry faculty, are thine. Task me to all that nature can perform, Bid me dare perils, rush on sure destruction, I'll meet it all for thee! IDA. Thou hast sav'd my lifeâ But what is life condemn'd to endless anguish! Pass but a few brief hours, and Ida's heart Torn with conflicting agonies will break. I see thou dost compassionate meâheav'n Sent thee to succour me in my distressâ Oh save me now from mis'ry worse than death! HERMAN. There is but one wayâbutâ IDA. Oh guess the rest! In pity do not force me to say more! HERMAN. 'Till now I never knew what mis'ry was. Heav'n opens to my viewâresplendent scenes Of never ending joys my senses dazzleâ An angel bids me seize them as mine ownâ But ah! between a hideous gulph expands, Forbidding all approach.âOh Arnold! Arnold! IDA. Whom call'st thou on? HERMAN. I told thee of the promise By which I'm firmly bound to secrecy. To him 'tis giv'n. Should I prove false to him, Can'st thou depend on me? I pray thee grant me A few short momentsâlet me fly to him, Implore him to release me from the bond That now enchains meâ IDA. I'll not seek to tempt thee To break those ties which honour has cemented. Go, seek thy friendâthen think of hapless Idaâ Think that to-morrowâ HERMAN. Speak it not againâ For life or death I goâfarewellâfarewell! [Exeunt severally. END OF ACT II.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT III. SCENE I. The Forest. Enter Arnold. ARNOLD. I cannot rest within my 'custom'd haunt. A thousand agitating thoughts assail me, And draw me forth to learn the fate of Herman Now hast'ning to its crisis. Hapless youth! Victim of guilt abhorrent from my soulâ A parent's guilt!âOh Walstein, cruel father! Why thus entail on me thy deadly hate, Make me the wretched heir of thy revenge, A vile accomplice in the degradation Of this dear youth, whose brave and mounting spirit Soars to that eminence from which thou drag'st him? I can no longer act the shameful part Thou didst enjoin me. Duty, honour, nature, Assert their claim. I will obey their call, Break through my trammels, and with Herman fly These guilty shades for ever!âWho comes there? Enter Herman. HERMAN. A wretch, whom even hope, the wretch's friend, Abandons to despair. Bear with me, brother, I need thy pitying succour to support me. She's lost to me for ever! ARNOLD. Heav'n forefend! HERMAN. Yes, lost for ever. Think what agony Seiz'd on my struggling heart, when, as she own'd With blushing diffidence her pure affection, She told me that to-morrow, aye, to-morrow Will see her wedded to another. ARNOLD. How? HERMAN. One whom her soul detests. Amid her tears A smile of tenderness beam'd forth, as thus With gen'rous confidence she spoke. Alas! I could not smile; my heart was torn with anguish; Dumb, trembling, lost to sense I stood before her: Though happiness appear'd within my grasp, I dar'd not seize it. ARNOLD. What prevented thee? HERMAN. The conscious sense of my unworthiness. Think'st thou I'm so abandon'd of all good, So lost to ev'ry sentiment and feeling, As thus to take advantage of her favour, And make her unsuspecting purity The partner of an outlaw'd bandit's fortunes? Such foul deceit thy gen'rous soul would scorn. Thank heav'n! mine scorn'd it too. My heart may break, But never shall so base a treason stain it. ARNOLD (aside). Ill-fated youth! Nature will speak in thee, And vindicate her work.â(To him) Be of good courage. Though fortune now be adverse, she may grow Hereafter more propitious. There are changes, More than men look for, in the motley scene Of our existence. Who can tell how soon The cloud which now o'ershadows thee may vanish, Leaving thy worth, like the meridian sun, To dazzle with its brightness? Tell me, Herman, Were such thy fate, wert thou her equal, would'st thou Reject her proffer? HERMAN. Mock me not, I prayâ A wretch like me, who hardly may aspire To gaze on her perfectionsâa poor outcast, Bankrupt in fame and fortuneâ ARNOLD. There may be More in fate's mystic volume, than thine eye As yet can penetrate. In the deep mine Lurks many a gem, which, polish'd, may adorn A monarch's diadem. HERMAN. What dost thou mean? ARNOLD. That which I dare not more distinctly speak. But let this cheering thought compose thine anguishâ There is a pow'r, which watches over virtue, And leads it in due time to happiness. HERMAN. Mine is, alas! impossible! ARNOLD. Why so? If on thy worth alone her love be founded, Thou may'st indeed be happy. I would try it, And by a test which would not leave a doubt. She knows thee now but as thou seem'st, a peasant, Nor entertains suspicion to affect Thy reputation. Tell me, have I thought Too highly of thee, when I deem'd thy soul Endued with resolution to encounter Whatever risk might wait on an adherence To virtue's dictates? Dar'st thou undertake A task revolting to thy gallant nature? HERMAN. Try me. Whatever duty prompts I dare. ARNOLD. Thou hast, observant of thy faith, abstain'd From owning thy condition. Can'st thou now Boldly avow to her the fatal truth? HERMAN. Confess mine infamy! Avow myself Associate with banditti! Before heav'n! It were an easier task at once to end My life and misery, than thus proclaim Mine own dishonour! ARNOLD. Pause awhile, and hear me. Thine Ida plac'd her confidence in thee; Wilt thou be less sincere tow'rds her? HERMAN. Thou ask'st More than man's nature can achieve. ARNOLD. For shame! Canst thou deceive her? No! thine heart will tell thee She has a claim to be appriz'd of all. If her firm soul shall then remain unshaken, Invite her in some other clime to share Our future fortunes. If her pride of station Should make her scorn thee when thou'rt known, whate'er The pang that rends thy heart, conscious desert, The sense of inward rectitude and honour, Will prove a consolation whichâ HERMAN. Enough! Ensue what may, I will adventure it. Farewellâdetain me notâa word, a thought May warp me from my purpose. Life or death Are in suspense before me. When we meet, I'm lost for ever, or for ever blest! [Exeunt severally. SCENE II. An Apartment in Stolberg Castle. Enter Baron Stolberg and Count Rodolph. BARON. My lord, my lord, I pray no more of this. Still bick'ring and complaining! RODOLPH. What, my lord! On th' eve of marriage, to submit to treatment So disrespectful and so indecorous! The lady Ida is a handsome lady, And, as your lordship's niece and only heir, Entitled to respect; yet, I must own, Some little cultivation of her talents, Some small initiation in the world, Might have enchanc'd her nat'ral excellence. BARON. I beg your lordship's leave to differ from you. From my small observation of the world, I entertain some doubts how its example Could make her wiser, modester, or better. RODOLPH. Your lordship misconceives me. Those are points Quite unconnected with my observation. BARON. I'm sorry for't. I should have thought they were The qualities a wise man would most seek for. RODOLPH. For a plebeian maxim that may do; But is your lordship yet to learn that we, Who fill a more exalted sphere, require, In those whom we select to share our rank, Something more dignified, more graceful, moreâ BARON. Well, well, my lord, if that's your sentiment, You've made in coming here a small mistake. We are old-fashion'd people, and can't hope To grow familiar with new-fangled notions. RODOLPH. My notions, give me leave to tell your lordship, Are quite correct. There is a certain manner, A kind of graceâ BARON. Well, say no more about itâ There's no harm doneâthere may be families More suited to your lordship's way of thinking Than mine. The heiress of these rich domains Need not despair of suitors. There are many, As dignified as you, who'd gladly take her, With all the imperfections you object to. RODOLPH. (Aside) âPlague on my petulance! I've gone too far: Th' old gentleman must be appeas'd, or else I lose all chance of his estate.â(To the Baron)âMy lord, I ask your lordship's pardon. On my honour, You quite and clear mistake me. Lady Ida Is a most dignified, accomplish'd lady, The paragon of female excellence. BARON. Heyday! Why just this moment Ida was A rude, uncultivated girl, and now She is a paragon of excellence. Your lordship's humble servantâyou can veer, I find, with ev'ry wind. RODOLPH. Who, I, my lord? I crave permission to assure your lordship You must undoubtedly have misconceiv'd me. I entertain the most profound respect For the young lady. BARON. Well, wellâin that case, What if your lordship should adopt a manner A little better suited to her notions? As you are like to pass your lives together, 'Twould be as well to set out on good terms. RODOLPH. My lord, I'm ready to do any thing You may require. BARON. Then, in the first place, Make up your silly quarrel, set things right, And let me see you both with cheerful faces. I'll go with you. I warrant me, you'll find her As gentle as a lamb. These girls, my lord, Think they've a privilege, while courtship lasts, To have their way; and it is fair they should, For, poor things! matrimony makes strange changes. [Exeunt. SCENE III. An Apartment in Stolberg Castle. Enter Agatha. AGATHA. Why lady Ida! Bless us! not here either? What's come of the dear child? Why, lady Ida! Enter Ida. IDA. Well, nurse, I'm here. AGATHA. There's such a do below, Such moving and removing, such a bevy Of carpenters and joiners, glaziers, painters, All hard at work in making preparation For the great feast to-morrow, that I vow My poor head turnsâdo feel, dear, how I trembleâ I'm all in such a twitterâ IDA. Well, sit downâ Compose yourselfâsoâWhy did you call me? AGATHA. Well, who'd have thought it sixteen years ago It should have come to this? Saint Bridget save us! You was not thus high when you first came here, And now, heav'n bless the mark! you must be married. To see how things turn out! I vow it seems But yesterday, when my good lord sent for you, To comfort him, poor man! for th' heavy loss Of his young Albert. And I'm sure I thought I should have died too. IDA. You must have felt much For one you nurs'd. AGATHA. Aye marryâtwo whole years I tended him. If he had been mine own I had not lov'd him better. Lammas next He'd have been twenty-one. He ran about, And talk'd so prettily withal, and smil'dâ Poor little fellow! he so lov'd his nurseâ IDA. Nay, do not weepâcheer upâcome, tell me, nurse, What did you want with me? AGATHA. With you? See there nowâ I had clean forgotten. As I was returning From goody Martin's cottage, where you sent me To look at her sick childâit's getting betterâ I met a young man just at the park corner, A kind of peasant-looking lad, who stopt me, And ask'd me to deliver you a letterâ IDA. Dear Agatha, where is't? Comeâgive it meâ AGATHA. Stayâdon't be so impatientâLet me feel In t'other pocketâNow Saint Bridget save me If I ha'n't dropt it in my hurry. IDA. Dropt it? AGATHA. Where can it be?âNow if I hav'n't pok'd it Here in my kerchiefâ IDA. Give it me, good nurseâ AGATHA. Well, child, and am I to take back an answer? I bad the bearer wait.âWell, take your timeâ I have a thousand things to do.âGood bye! [Exit. IDA. â(Reads). âAbsolv'd by him to whom my faith was given, âIf Ida deign to hear me, I'm prepar'd âTo state the whole of my disastrous story.â Disastrous say'st thou? Hath calamity Blighted so early thy fres-budding hopes? Alas! Why should capricious fortune heap Her amplest gifts on such a thing as Rodolph, And leave thee destitute? Ill-fated youth! I love thee more for knowing thou'rt unhappy! [Exit. SCENE IV. A Bower in Stolberg Garden. Enter Herman. HERMAN. Why lingers yet the sov'reign arbitress Of hapless Herman's fate? Is't that, foreknowing The dreadful truths he is about to tell, Her tender nature shrinks from the rude trial, And bids her shun a wretch unworthy of her?â Lo! where she comes, all purity and truth. Now, now she sees meâwhat a heav'nly grace Beams o'er her lovely countenance! Enter Ida. IDA. Thou tell'st me Thou art the victim of calamity. When I believ'd thee happy I esteem'd thee; But when thou say'st that premature misfortune Hath weigh'd upon thee heavily, oh! stay not To tell the fatal tale. Think me thy friend, Point out the means by which I may relieve thee. HERMAN. Transcendent sweetness! Thou art all perfection, Pure as yon heav'n, to which we all aspire, Though conscience tell us we're unworthy of it. Ah! fix not thus on me thy pitying glance; Thy tenderness unmans me: I have need Of all my firmness, to complete the task, Which stubborn duty has impos'd on me. Let me implore thee, lady, to vouchsafe A patient hearing to my luckless story. I've that to tell theeâbut alas! how can I Detail the horrors of my cruel fate, Or be the herald of mine own disgrace! IDA. I will not credit thee. Thou art too noble To merit the reproach thy words imply. HERMAN. Hear then, and, if thou can'st, disdain me not. I am the victim of another's guilt; A father's crimesâI tremble to relate itâ Entail'd a curse on his devoted offspring. Say, lady, hath perchance the name of Walstein E'er met thine ear? IDA. Walstein dost say? Good heav'n! He was my uncle's direst foe. HERMAN. That Walstein Was Herman's father. To detail the cause Which drove him, as an outcast from mankind, To shun society, and to become Its bitt'rest foe, would be an idle waste Of the few precious moments thus allow'd me. Suffice it then to say, within this forest He found a refuge. There, in a lone cavern, A troop of wild banditti held their station. With them associate, soon superior talent Made him their leader. Many a toilsome year Witness'd his lawless reign, and when at length His days were number'd, on my elder brother Devolv'd his rude precedence. I meanwhileâ IDA. Thou Hermanâthou the inmate of a cavern! HERMAN. From earliest youth such was my destiny. Yet often would a glancing ray of light Beam on my soul, and fancied images Of better recollections cross my mind, Confus'd and indistinct, like the faint shadows Of a gay dream, which haunt the wand'ring fancy Of a poor wretch who wakes to certain woe. Such certainty was mine. 'Till the blest hour When I saw thee, no cheering hope appear'd To pierce the gloom that thus envelop'd me. IDA. No moreâthou hast already said too muchâ Thou the associate of a felon crew!â In pity oh unsay the dreadful story! HERMAN. I knew thou could'st not choose but hate me, lady; Yet canst thou not detest me more, than I Detest myself. Though haply I may plead The errors of my youth were not mine own. They were mine only legacy deriv'd From an unhappy father, once class'd high Among Hungaria's peers. He brought me up 'Mid scenes of guilt; but they could not efface The principles which nature had implanted In my young heart. Heav'n had bestow'd one gift, One precious gift, to save me from perdition. An elder brotherâlet me rather call him My guardian angelâpitied and preserv'd me. Virtuous himself, he taught me to love virtue. With him am I about to quit these haunts, And in some foreign clime, where yet our shame Is not by rumour blazon'd, seek a fortune More kindred to our birth and inborn feelings. To-morrow's sun will witness our departureâ IDA. Go then, and leave me to despair!âOr if Thy purposes, brave youth, be those of virtueâ Nay, look not on me thusâI don't distrust theeâ I know, I feel they cannot but be virtuousâ Stay, and support me, Herman, 'gainst a fate, Which now the knowledge of a worth like thine Hath render'd insupportable.âJust heav'n! Condemn me not, for yielding to an influence I cannot combat.âIf thou'st truth or feeling, Let me implore thee not to leave me thusâ Save me, oh save me, Herman, from destruction! HERMAN. Oh rack not thus my bosom! Tempt me not Beyond the bearing of a man!âI must notâ I dare not understand thee. Thou'rt too pure, Too dignified, to share the hapless fortunes Of a lost wretch like me. IDA. No, Herman, noâ Thy worth and innate nobleness exalt thee To a proud eminence, whence with disdain Thou may'st look down on rank and dignities. Hence then each idle sentiment of pride! My soul's above ye! Henceforth let me prove I am thine equal, Herman, in those feelings Which have engag'd my heart. Go where thou wilt, Betide what may, I'll follow theeâbecome The faithful sharer of thy humblest fortunesâ I'll aid theeâcomfort theeânay, beg for theeâ HERMAN. Sure thou'rt some seraph wrapt in human form! [Embracing her. Forgive me, ladyâHerman for a moment Forgot himself and thee.âHeav'ns! dost thou weep? Oh spare me, spare me! Ev'ry pearly drop Which trickles from those eyes, each sigh which heaves That bosom, raise a tempest in my soul, Which mortal constancy cannot sustain.â Have pity on me, heav'n! I feel my weaknessâ My heart proves traitorâBut it may not beâ I cannot prove a villain, and undo thee. Oh! let me fly thee, while I yet have pow'r To bear the conflict of contending passions. If I look on thee, if I hear thy voice, I am no more myself.âMay angels guard thee! [Exit. IDA. Stay, Herman, stay!âhe's gone!âAlas! with him My peace and happiness are flown together. Thou leav'st me, Herman! We may meet no more, Never again that eye, that voice may cheer me: But ever present to my suff'ring heart Shall be the mem'ry of thy gallant nature. Thus, in the presence of all-seeing heav'n, To thee eternal constancy I vow. Though climes may intervene, though trackless oceans May roll between us, thy still cherish'd image Shall follow me to solitude, and teach me To consecrate my soul to thee and virtue! [Exit.

      <field name="fulltext">ACT IV. SCENE I. An Apartment in Stolberg Castle. Enter Baron Stolberg and Agatha. BARON. Come, stir about, good Agatha, there's much Yet to be done. We have no time to lose. The ev'ning's far advanc'd, and I protest The priest and all our noble company Will arrive here to-morrow ere we're ready. AGATHA. I'm sure, Saint Bridget help me, I have toil'd And bustled to and fro, up stairs and down, And looking after ev'ry thingâWhy Housdorffâ See there now, what's become of him?âIf I Am not the most unfortunate old woman In Hungary!âWill no one hear?âWhy Housdorff! Enter Housdorff. HOUSDORFF. How now, good dame, what news is come to town, That makes thee thus obstreperous? AGATHA. Good Housdorff, Look to the furbishers in the great chamber, See that the tap'stry hangings are brush'd up, The carpets spread, and all the covers taken From the best chairs and couches; and just peep Into the banquet hall, see that the tables Are all set out, and the chac'd family plate Display'd upon the side-boardâ HOUSDORFF. All is done. AGATHA. Well, I must go incontinently to The bridal chamberâ HOUSDORFF. Fie, good Agatha, Incontinently, say'st thou? AGATHA. Aye, gibe onâ I have no time to answer you.âSee there now, I almost had forgottenâWould your lordship Have the new curtains fitted to the bed, Or have the hangings from the oriel chamber Remov'd? BARON. Oh! have the new ones by all means. Thereâset about itâgo along. [Exeunt Agatha and Housdorff. Enter Ida. What, Ida! So late, my love? Not yet retir'd to rest? Heyday! What means this sadness? Surely, love, Thou hast been weeping. IDA. I have cause enough To be distress'd, when thus you cast me from you, Force me to leave my first, my best protectorâ BARON. Nay, be not such a simpletonâcheer upâ We were all busied here, in preparations For thee, my love, and for to-morrow's bus'ness. I am a foolish weak old fellow, child, And, if I don't keep moving, I'm afraid I hardly shall have courage to go through My parting with thee. Thou hast been my pride, My Ida, the sole darling of my heart, My only hope since my poor boy was lost. I'm growing old apaceâwhen thou art gone, No one will care for meâNay, do not weepâ IDA. Ah! do not make me quit you; suffer me Still to attend upon you, still to watch On your declining age, and minister With dutiful affection to your wishes. You love your Ida, uncle? BARON. Love thee, child? Aye, better than my life. IDA. Why then compel me To leave you, when my services may most Promote your happiness? Indeed, indeed, It is not kind of you. BARON. Nay, now thou'rt foolish, To talk to an old fellow in this way, When a brisk bridegroom courts thee to his arms. IDA. D'you know, my good dear uncle, that I think you Ten thousand times more pleasant and more charming Than this fine gentleman, whose sole concern Seems his own darling self! BARON. Why, to say truth, He has a way with him, a disregard For other people's sentiments and wishesâ But he means nothing by itâhe'll turn out An excellent good husband. IDA. Do, dear uncle, Consent to let me still remain with you. I'll be so good, and so obedient to you, Take so much care of youâ BARON. Goâthou'rt a coaxerâ Thou'lt speak another sort of language soon. The Count may seem perhaps a little cool, Not quite so ready to pick up thy glove, Or run on errands for thee, as some others; But then thou must consider, my dear child, He is a man of rank, a courtier, child, Who has a name and station to keep up. IDA. With all my heartâhe has my free permission To be as proud and stupid as he pleases, Provided I am not oblig'd to have him. BARON. Why how now, niece! Not have him? IDA. Don't be angryâ I do detest him mortally. BARON. So, soâ A pretty bus'ness we should make of itâ Pray, madam, tell me, is not he a noble Of prime distinction, high in royal favour, And, what's still more important, is he not My choice? IDA. And my aversion! Dearest sir, Do pardon your poor Ida, but indeed, Sooner than marry him, I'd try to gain My livelihood by labour. 'Twere more honest, And ten times pleasanterâ BARON. Heav'n grant me patience! Hark'ee, young madamâBut I will be calmâ Tell meâis this a trick to try my temper? IDA. Alas! I love you better than myself, But you will break my heart. BARON. No, never fear; Young women's hearts are not so quickly brokenâ IDA. I would do any thing to please you, sir, Butâ BARON. That's the way of all of youââI'd do âAny thing, sir, to please you, butââyes, truly, That âbutâ comes opportunely inâBut what? IDA. Would my death please you? BARON. Noâthou know'st it wouldn'tâ Thou know'st I love theeâ IDA. I implore forgivenessâ I feel unwellâLet me retire, I pray. BARON. No, no, ma'am, that excuse sha'n't serve your turnâ [Ida staggers to a chair. Why what's the matter with the child? You tremble, And grow so paleâ IDA. Indeed I'm very illâ BARON. Nay, thou art ill indeedâWhy Agatha! So, so, my loveâWhy Agatha, I say!â Nobody come! Enter Agatha. See, see, good Agatha! AGATHA. Let me come to herâNow the saints be goodâ Why, Ida!âWhat's to do hereâgive her airâ Untie her corsetâsoâraise her a littleâ Thereânow she's betterâ IDA. Let me go, I pray, To my own chamber. BARON. Aye, love, we'll conduct thee. So, lean on me. Good Agatha, make haste, And get things ready for her.âNow, my dearâ How could I have the heart to treat her thus! A curs'd, ill-temper'd puppy!âSoftly, love! [Exeunt. SCENE II. Interior of the Banditti's Cavern. Enter Finck. FINCK. What ho! none stirring yet? Your wine was heady, That thus you sleep it out.âWhat ho! I sayâ Enter Swartz. SWARTZ. Plague on your brawling! Why we might as well Live in a scurvy brotherhood of monks, And be rung up at midnight to our pray'rs, As thus be rous'd. I'll lay my life the night Is not half spent. FINCK. I rais'd the trap e'en nowâ The great bear stood over the dodder'd oak That rises singly on the crag, and told me 'Twas three o'clock. 'Tis time we were abroad. The day will dawn anonâwe've an account To settle with the world, for yesterday Turn'd out a blank.âSoâyou are up at last. Enter Gortz and other Banditti. Where is our captain? GORTZ. Where I wish I was tooâ Sound on his mattress yonder, I suppose. Whate'er his other qualities may be, I'll wager my next booty 'gainst a pumpkin, There's not a man in Hungary shall match him For a sound sleeper. FINCK. No reflections, Gortzâ Comeâlet us rouse him with a rumbling catch. Trio by Finck, Swartz, and Gortz. Night her darkling course has run, And yields her empire to the sun; Hooting owls their flight have made, And scud for shelter in the glade. There let them hide; we sons of day Through the wide forest take our way, And, whereso'er is seen our band, Our watch-word still is stand, stand, stand. FINCK. Well said, i'faith! If this don't bring him out, The fam'd seven sleepers were mere boys to him. Enter Arnold. ARNOLD. What, all alert? This augurs ill, methinks, For those who travel early 'cross our haunts. How wears the time? FINCK. 'Tis about three, I take it. ARNOLD. Know ye if Baron Stolberg hunt to-day? FINCK. And if he do, what's that to us? ARNOLD. Why this. His sport of yesterday, you know, marr'd yours. If he again should take the field, your trouble Will prove of small avail. SWARTZ. That's true enough. But how to ascertain if he go forth? ARNOLD. Leave that to me. I'll venture out alone, And bring you information. You, meanwhile, Adjourn to th' refectory, and recruit Your spirits with a cup of gen'rous wine. What say ye, comrades? FINCK. That the motion's good; And, if the liquor prove not worse, you'll find us, When you return, well prim'd for action.âComeâ Lets drink to our commander's good success. [Exeunt. ARNOLD. They're well dispos'd of for an hour or two. And now to meet my Herman in the forest. [Exit through the trap-door. SCENE III. The Forest. The Dawn just breaking. Enter Herman. HERMAN. The morning dawns; and renovated nature Awakens to receive the sun's glad beams That summon her to life and new exertion. Creation smiles around me; in each glade The gay birds carol; every flow'ret lifts Its gaudy head, and scatters round its fragrance. All, all but me the gen'ral transport share. Me the light cheers notâyonder glowing east Is but the harbinger of woe to me, Denouncing horror and despair. Enter Arnold. ARNOLD. Who thus Talks of despair? Thou, Herman? HERMAN. Oh my brother! ARNOLD. I look'd to meet thee full of hope and joy. Hath any ill betided? HERMAN. I am wretchedâ My heart is almost brokenâI've fulfill'd My promiseâI have told her allâ ARNOLD. Is then her love fleeting as yonder clouds That skim o'er heav'n's expanse? HERMAN. Oh! wrong her notâ Her love, her faith are spotless as herself; But I am ruin'd, lost to ev'ry hopeâ ARNOLD. This surely is extravagance. Thou'st prov'd her, As thou can'st wish, affectionate and constant. Why then talk idly thus of being wretched? HERMAN. That very proof thou speak'st of has undone me. Had I not learnt the value of the prize At which I aim'd, I had not felt the anguish Which harrows up my soul. Oh, my best brother! Had'st thou but seen how nobly she sustain'd The fatal truths I utter'd, thou'st have lov'd her; Nay, thou'st have worshipp'd her, had'st thou but seen her When I discours'd to her of thee, my Arnold, And of thy virtues. From her eyes dropt tears Of gen'rous sympathy, her bosom throbb'd, She could not speakâbut when at length I told her Of our resolve to quit these guilty shades, And seek renown in some far distant clime, Her tears no longer flow'd; transport illum'd Her glowing cheeks; with more than human firmness She bad me save her from a rival's arms; She vow'd to follow, nay to beg for me. ARNOLD. Could'st thou resist her proffer? HERMAN. Could I live Weigh'd down by consciousness of foul dishonour? Heav'n knows my heart, I love her far too well To be the author of her wretchednessâ Reduce her to an outlaw'd bandit's fortunes?â No, noâthank heav'n! that fate I have escap'd. ARNOLD (aside). Passion so works on his too feeling nature, He must not thus be left.âCan'st thou trust me? HERMAN. I can. ARNOLD. Then thus I'll put thee to the proof. That ring from thy lov'd Ida's hand receiv'dâ Intrust it to me. HERMAN. Ha! the ring dost say? Ask any thing but thatâ ARNOLD. And canst thou doubt me? HERMAN. I doubt thee notâI'd trust thee with my lifeâ But there's a sacred int'rest in that ringâ I vow'd to keep itâ ARNOLD. I've a work in hand Which will not brook delayâthine own, thine Ida's Redemption from the ills which menace you. Without that ring I can do nothingâ HERMAN. Take itâ 'Tis the sole treasure I possess on earth. ARNOLD. Fear notâ'tis safe with me.âFarewellâI go To serve thee and thy loveâEnquire not whereâ Trust to my zeal and friendship. In that grove Wait my return. Ere the fresh risen sun Shall gild yon mountain, I'll be back with thee. [Exeunt severally. SCENE IV. An Apartment with a glass Door opening into a Garden. On one side, Ida reposing on a Couch. A lighted Lamp on a Table. Baron Stolberg, Count Rodolph, Ditmar, and Agatha. BARON. I am extremely mortified, my lord, At this untoward accident. RODOLPH. Why truly It rather is mal-Ã -propos.â(To Ditmar) Pray, sir, As you're physician to the household here, Allow me to demand your way of thinking. DITMAR. I have no very particular way, my lord; My way of thinking is, as I conjecture, Like that of other men. RODOLPH. Sir, that's no answer. I have a right to know the manner, sir, In which you think. DITMAR. Really that's rather oddâ But, if you must know how I set about it, I've not the least objection to inform you. Whenever I've a knotty point in hand That calls for serious deliberation, I gen'rally sit down, and, pouring out A glass of ale, I light my pipeâ RODOLPH. Sir, you're Impertinentâ BARON. What moves your lordship thus? What is the matter, doctor? DITMAR. I protest I know notâI intended no offence. RODOLPH. No, sir?âDid you not tell me, when I ask'd Your way of thinking 'bout the lady's illnessâ DITMAR. About the lady's illness? Hoh! that's quite A diff'rent thing. I comprehend you now. My way of thinking is, her nervous systemâ That is, her nerves seem to be what we call Shatter'dâderang'dâand shaken all to pieces.â Ahem! She must have sedativesânarcoticsâ Something to tranquillizeâYou comprehend me? BARON. Perfectly, doctor. If I take you right, In the first instance you would recommend Your patient to be kept extremely quiet. DITMAR. Nothing on earth is better. BARON. Then, my lord, Suppose we leave her for a while. Hey, doctor? Will you attend our consultation? You shall have all your implements for thinking. Take care of the dear child, good Agatha. [Exeunt the Baron, Rodolph, and Ditmar. AGATHA. Marry, and if Saint Bridget please, I will. I'll sit me down awhile. 'Tis a raw morning, And likely to breed rheums. (Covers her head with a kerchief.) There, now my head Is snug and comfortable.âBless the child! How quietly she dozesâI'll e'en take A little nap myselfâ IDA. Agatha! AGATHA. Wellâ I'm comingâwhat dost want, dear? IDA. I feel better, Good Agatha, I think. AGATHA. The saints be prais'd! IDA. So, Agatha, I wish you'd leave me now, And go to rest yourself. AGATHA. Leave you alone! IDA. I should be better for it. I can't sleep While you are sitting here. I pray you go. AGATHA. Well, dear, I will. I hope to find you better. [Agatha closes the curtains of the couch and goes out. IDA. â(Rising). This is indeed beyond the warmest hope I dar'd to form. One day, one blest day more At least is granted me, without a crime, To dedicate my thoughts to gen'rous Herman. Yet what relief can a short day afford, When ev'ry hope is blasted, and futurity Brings with it nought but lasting wretchedness? Oh! that protecting Providence would snatch me From ills which human aid cannot ward off, Would send some guardian spirit charg'd with mercyâ Who's that?âDefend me heav'n!âA stranger!âSir, Enter Arnold. I know not by what priv'lege you presume To trespass on my privacyâ ARNOLD. By none. My boldness, lady, would preclude forgiveness, Had I not such a reason to allege, As may atone for my presumption. Behold my passport, lady. IDA. How! The ring I gave to Herman? ARNOLD. To my brother, lady. IDA. Your brother, sir? ARNOLD. I'm that unhappy Arnold, Whose humble efforts train'd his gen'rous soul To trace the path that leads to virtuous fame. I was prepar'd with him to quit the scene, Where cruel fate had doom'd us to become Associates with the refuse of mankind, In other climes to achieve the fair renown, That heritage of our once pure descent, Now stain'd, pollutedâbut no more of thatâ Our visionary prospects now are cloudedâ IDA. Speak, sir, I pray you say what has occurr'dâ ARNOLD. I have left Hermanâ IDA. What of him? No evil Hath sure betided himâ ARNOLD. None, but such as You have the pow'r to remedy. He loves you With all the ardour of a gallant spirit, Which can appreciate all your excellence, But which not all that excellence itself, Nor all the whirlwind of contending passions, Can force beyond the sacred bound of honour To build his happiness upon your ruin. IDA. I felt, and do full justice to his motives. He might have sav'd me fromâ ARNOLD. He willâhe mustâ The hour ordain'd by fate to exalt you both To the pure bliss you merit is arriv'd, And now, by me its minister, invites you To seize the favouring opportunity. You are a noble ladyâI have heard What pass'd betwixt youâthere is not a secret Of Herman's soul that's not reveal'd to meâ His ev'ry thought, his ev'ry wish are thineâ You rule his destinyâ IDA. Pity me, sir! I am indeed most wretched and abandon'dâ Torn by conflicting passions!âHerman's lostâ Another, ah how diff'rent! claims my handâ This day, this fatal day, unites me to himâ I have no friend to counsel or assist meâ ARNOLD. If one like me, unknown to you by aught But Herman's fair report, may claim that title, I hold my life as nought, so I may save From ev'ry ill the mistress of his soul. Say, lady, are your sentiments unchang'd, Will you still fly these nuptials, and partake The fate of him who loves you for yourself? IDA. Heav'n knows my heart I would! ARNOLD. Then fly with me To save him from despairâDread not th' event, When virtue and affection are your guides, And Providence the guardian of your way. Nay, be of good cheer, ladyâthere's a secret, Which now envelopes Herman's destiny, That time must soon disclose. Then shalt thou find him Not less in rank and station worthy of thee, Than now in innate nobleness.âBelieve meâ I pledge my life on't thou wilt find him so. IDA. I cannot doubt thee.âGive me a short momentâ I would reflectâ ARNOLD. Reflection's now too lateâ Time pressesâyour attendants will returnâ They will discover meâThe hour's at hand When legal violence will drag you hence To pledge the hateful vowsâThink on poor Herman, Whose heart is torn with agonyâ IDA. No moreâ I will believe that heav'n hath heard my pray'r, And in compassion sent thee here to save me. Sir, in the name of him you love, of Herman, I trust myself to you and to your honour. ARNOLD. May heav'n no more regard me when I fail you! Now, lady, onâto Herman and to love! [Exeunt. END OF ACT IV.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ACT V. SCENE I. Ida's Apartment. Enter Agatha. AGATHA. Soâall quite quiet, and the curtains drawn. How still the dear child isâNow bless her soul, I've a good mind to take a little peep Just to look at herâ(Opens the curtains)âAh! where is the child? Why Ida!âWhat's become of her?âWhy Ida!â Oh that I ne'er had liv'd to see this day!â Housdorff!âI tremble soâWhy Gregory! Peter!âWhere are you all? Enter the Baron, the Count, Ditmar and Servants. BARON. What's here to do? AGATHA. She's gone! BARON. Who's gone? AGATHA. Oh my poor child! BARON. What! Ida? Death and destruction!âPeter! Gregory! What are you doing here? Search ev'ry whereâ [Exeunt Agatha and Servants. I'll go myself. (To Rodolph)âMy lord, why don't you stir? RODOLPH. I can't imagine why your lordship takes All this unnecessary trouble. BARON. Trouble! No trouble at all, sir; and you might as well Exert yourself, I think. RODOLPH. I hate exertions. I'm always very cool on these occasions. BARON. Aye, so it seems indeed. RODOLPH. Twenty to one, Your lordship labours under a mistake. BARON. Was ever suchâWhy is not the girl gone? RODOLPH. And what's so very wonderful in that? If, after all, it should turn out the lady, Finding herself refresh'd, has merely taken A turn i' th' gardenâ DITMAR. Nothing is more likely To do her good, and tranquillize her spirits. BARON. Taking a walk, d'you say? If I thought thatâ DITMAR. The very thing that I should recommend For one in her condition. BARON. You don't say so? Nay, if it be no more than thatâBut really I must confess I was alarm'd at first. Enter Agatha and Servants. Well, Agatha, what news? AGATHA. Oh it's all overâ She is elop'dâgone offâ BARON. Gone off!âWith whom? AGATHA. Nay, an I knowâBut gone she is for certain. There stands the door, at t'other end o' th' garden, Next to the wood, wide open, with the lock Wrench'd offâ BARON. Now, pray sir, how am I mistaken? RODOLPH. The circumstances really seem suspicious. BARON. They do! Enter Housdorff. HOUSDORFF. My lord, you must bestir yourself. The lady Idaâ BARON. Wellâ HOUSDORFF. I was preparing To look for some game in the nether copse, When, on a sudden, from the garden gate I saw her sally forth, accompanied By a young man. BARON. Confusion! A young man? Why howâwho was he?âWhat did he look like? HOUSDORFF. I was too far off to distinguish him, And, ere I could get round to follow them, They'd struck into the thickest part o'th'forest. BARON. Set off! Pursue them!âHousdorff! call all handsâ Swords, pistols, carbines! [Exeunt Housdorff, Agatha, and Servants. Now, my lord, perhaps, You'll condescend t'exert yourself. RODOLPH. My lord, I'll do myself the honour to attend you. [Exeunt. SCENE II. The Forest. Enter Arnold and Ida. ARNOLD. Keep up your spirits, madam, we have nearly Got to a place of safety. But I fear You'll be fatigued. IDA. Oft when the pipe and tabor Have echo'd through the hall, I've led the train Of merry dancers twice as far, nor ever Felt weary or exhausted. It were hard If I fail'd now, when ev'ry thing depends On my exertion. Come, sir, I am ready. Let us go on. ARNOLD. There, through yon op'ning glade Must we pursue our course.âBut hark! What's that? Heard you not, madam? IDA. But too plainly. 'Tis The sound of voices. Now it louder grows. I fear they have discover'd my departure, And are in close pursuit of us. ARNOLD. 'Tis so. We have no time to lose. Come onâthis way. [Exeunt. SCENE III. Another Part of the Forest. Enter Herman. HERMAN. Why stay'st thou, Arnold? Why prevent me thus From ranging freely through this wilderness With its free denizens, the fit associates Of a lost wretch like me? I'm not less savage, Less outcast from society than theyâ ARNOLD (from behind). Now have we reach'd the spot. HERMAN. 'Tis Arnold's voiceâ ARNOLD. Where art thou, Herman! HERMAN. Here! Enter Arnold and Ida. Immortal pow'rs! Do I behold thee, Ida? ARNOLD. We're pursuedâ Here, take my weaponâsee thou guard'st her well. I must haste on, to summon further aid. [Exit. HERMAN. Let who will come, I'll guard thee with my life. IDA. I fear not for myself. They will respect me. But as for theeâ HERMAN. Let's hasten quickly onâ This wayâ IDA. Impossibleâdost thou not hear? HERMAN. We're circled in on ev'ry handâI pray thee Stand there aloof, and leave me here to face them. IDA. Abandon thee? No, never! Enter Housdorff and Servants. HOUSDORFF. Here they are! Seize him! Lay hold of him! HERMAN. Hear meâone wordâ HOUSDORFF. No wordsâFall onâ IDA. Forbear, I charge thee, Housdorffâ Hear me at leastâ HOUSDORFF. There will be time anon: Our business is with that gentleman. Give up thy sword, and yield thyself our pris'ner, Or take the consequences of thy rashness. HERMAN. Were instant death the consequence, I would not Purchase inglorious life on such condition. Come onâI dare you allâ HOUSDORFF. Now, ladsâthat's rightâ [They fightâHerman is taken. Beshrew me, but thou did'st it well, young man, 'Twas no boy's play to master thee. You, Peter, And you, secure him well, see he escape not; And do you, Gregory, hasten to the castle With news of our success. It will be worth A new suit to thee.âCome, my pretty lady, You are my special charge.âBring him along! [Exeunt. SCENE IV. Outside of the Banditti's Cavern. Enter Arnold, hastily. ARNOLD. At length I've reach'd the cavernâ(sounds his bugle) Haste! ascend!â(The trap-door opens). Enter Banditti. Is there among you one, who at the call Of honour will hold back when danger presses? FINCK. Try us. ARNOLD. When a brave comrade is in danger, Will you desert him? SWARTZ. Put us to the proof. ARNOLD. You answer heartily. Now hear me, friends. My brother, Herman, yonder is beset By a whole host of foesâThere is no mercy For him t'expect, unless we succour him. FINCK. Where is he? ARNOLD. In the grove of pines that skirts The road to Stolberg Castle. He has with him A treasureâ SWARTZ. Marry, then we go for something. ARNOLD. Aye, such a treasure, Swartz, as kings might envyâ The Baron's lovely heiress. SWARTZ. How the plague Shall we gain ought by that? ARNOLD. Why thus, good Swartzâ If we can rescue them from their pursuers, We shall obtain a pledge, which, at what price We please to fix, the Baron must redeem. FINCK. What think ye, lads?âOur captain speaks most sagely: A prize like that makes us all gentlemen. I'll on for oneâ BANDITTI. Aye, one and allâ FINCK. Lead on. ARNOLD. Thanks, my good friendsânow forward to his succour! [Exeunt. SCENE V. The great Hall in the Castle. Enter Housdorff and Servants. HOUSDORFF. Set ev'ry thing in orderâso, you're all Got here to see the trial I perceive. SERVANT. There's neither big nor little, man nor boy, Who has not hurried from his post, to have A peep at what goes forward. By the mass, The walls and gates may take care of themselves, For not a porter nor a centinel Is left to guard them. HOUSDORFF. Silence! Here's the Baron. Away, away! Be sure to be in readiness, When order's given, to attend the pris'ner. [Exeunt Housdorff and Servants. Enter Baron Stolberg and Count Rodolph. BARON. Be pleas'd to take a chair, my lord; we'll probe This strange mysterious business to the core.â(They sit). Your lordship must be sensible I feel, And pretty strongly too, on this occasion; But I still trust you'll put a fair construction Upon my niece's conduct. I'm convinc'd You'll find no censure can attach on her. RODOLPH. I'm an indiff'rent judge of these affairs. The lady Ida may, for aught I know, Have infinite desert; but certainly Her manners do appear rather eccentric To us who've liv'd in courts, and, in her style Of conversation, sentiments, and conduct, There's an agreeable rusticity, A kind of je ne sÃ§ai quoi so captivatingâ BARON (rising). My lord, I understand you; but such sarcasms, You'll give me leave to tell you, are mistim'd. RODOLPH. Not in the least. The thing is quite apparent. BARON. Is't so indeed? Well, well, I know you now. RODOLPH. I am rejoic'd you do. I should be glad To hear what great discov'ry you have made. BARON. I'll speak more truly of you than your glass does. You think yourself a most accomplish'd person, And in your own sphere, in the drawing room, Among the vain and gilded insects, who Spread their gay plumes, buzz their unmeaning nothings, And flutter in the sunshine of court favour, You may be a distinguish'd personageâ RODOLPH. That's trueâGo on. BARON. So much for what you are. And now for what you are not. You shall never Marry my niece, sir. RODOLPH. There you're wrong again. BARON. No, sir, I'm right, and you shall find it so. I'd have you know my Ida is a girl Train'd under my own eyeâ RODOLPH. So I should judge From her improvement. BARON. Should you so? Well, wellâ We'll settle that affair anon, sirâHousdorff!â When we have finish'd what we have in handâ Bring in the pris'nerâYou shall find, my lord, These taunts will not succeed at Stolberg castle. Enter Herman, Housdorff, Agatha, and Servants. Soâstand aside thereâlet me look at him.â A youthâand of an aspect fair and modestâ I should not guess him one mature in guilt, A midnight ravisherâMark me, young manâ Thou stand'st before me, charg'd with having forc'd Thine entrance here, and having borne away The lady Ida. HERMAN. 'Twere a weighty charge, If proof could reach it. Who is't dares accuse me? RODOLPH. Dar'st thou deny it? Thou'rt a special fellow To ask the question, when thou'rt apprehended In the direct commission of the crime. BARON. Pray, who requested you to interfere? RODOLPH. To interfere? BARON (to Herman). It matters not, young man, Who made the charge. What answer hast thou to it? HERMAN. Grant that the charge were founded, let me ask How my conviction of it would affect The lady or myself? BARON. No doubt would rest On her fair fame; thy portion would be death. HERMAN (aside). To dieâwith infamy to quit a world, In which I leave behind me no memorial Of one good deed to qualify my shame! 'Tis dreadful! But, by dying, to preserve Ida's fair fame, to vindicate her honour, With my last breath to champion her renownâ By heav'n! existence has no charms compar'd With such a death!âMy lord, I own the charge. BARON. You own it to be true then? HERMAN. I have said. BARON. How dar'dst thou thus, a youth whose cheek as yet Scarcely gives signal of well ripen'd manhood, Provoke my vengeance by a deed so hardy, That practis'd villainy would start at it? Tell meâWho art thou? Where is thine abode? HERMAN. I stand before thee, to abide the sentence Which justice may inflict on my offence. Whate'er it may be, I have made full atonement. The lady Ida's fame is clear'd; no tongue Can dare impeach her purity and honour. Take then my forfeit life, and let the wretch, Who with his blood confirms her innocence, Unquestion'd drop into his silent tomb, Where he and all his miseries may sleep In deep forgetfulness. BARON. Hath mis'ry then Been the companion of thine early years? HERMAN. The past I wish not to recal. What boots it To talk of one, who soon must cease to be, And whose inglorious life no splendid deed From merited oblivion has redeem'd? I pray thee, let me die as I have liv'd, Unnotic'd and unknown; and, since for death Thy sentence goes, this only I implore, Let not delay enhance its bitterness. RODOLPH. That seems a very reas'nable request. The sooner you comply with it the better. BARON. Is this a time for ribbald jesting, sir? Cannot the gallant firmness of this youth Move thee to pity? There is that about him Which strangely touches me, and makes me loth To pass the sentence of his death. Enter Ida. IDA. His death! What has he done to merit such a fate? RODOLPH. Surely your ladyship can't ask that question. A fellow who feloniously stole you When we had left you fast asleepâ IDA. 'Tis falseâ He's innocentâI'll swear he isâ BARON. Nay, nay, Hasn't he pleaded guilty? His confession Has clear'd thy reputation. IDA (aside). Gen'rous youth! Hast thou then sacrific'd thyself for me? (To the Baron). âSir, let me thus, in presence of that heav'n Which knows my truth, absolve him from offence. He enter'd not my chamber, he was not Companion of my flight. BARON. Were ye not found Together in the forest? IDA. I confess it; But he was not the man who led me thither. RODOLPH. So, then another was concern'd. Come, madam, Pray let us hear the fortunate man's name. IDA. Peace, wretch! thou'rt ev'ry way below my scorn. (To the Baron). âMy lord, to you I make appeal. When did I Speak other than the truth? BARON. Thou never did'st. IDA. Then, on my soul, that youth is innocent. BARON. Tell me then, Ida, on thy truth I charge thee, Who was th' audacious man who bore thee off? IDA. To that I cannot answer. BARON. No! Why not? I'll know it ere we part.â(To Herman)âSpeak thouâDeclare Who thy accomplice was?â(A noise without)âHa! What means this? Enter Arnold hastily. ARNOLD. Herman in bonds! Arraign'd too for his life! Forbear, rash man, thou know'st not what thou dost. I charge thee, by thy hopes of happiness Now and hereafter, to respect his life. Look on himâdoth not ev'ry nerve, each drop Of blood that circulates within thee, thrill When thou regard'st him?âTake him to thine heartâ He is thy son, thy long-lost Albertâ IDA. Heav'ns! His son!â(To the Baron)âOh! can you stand unmov'd and hear That name, so dear, so oft lemented by you? BARON. Say, who art thou, who confidently thus Call'st him my son? ARNOLD. My name is Arnold. BARON. Whence Com'st thou, and what thy station? ARNOLD. From the forest, Where a bold troop of bandits call me leader. RODOLPH. A proper witness! Seize on him! ARNOLD. Beware! Thou'dst better take a lion by the beard, Than lay a hand on me. [Sounds his bugle. RODOLPH. Zounds, what a peal! Enough to burst one's brain. Enter Banditti. FINCK. Here, noble captain; What is thy pleasure? Shall we seize them all? Here's one I make my pris'ner. He appears As if he'd ransom handsomelyâ [Seizes the Count. RODOLPH. Keep off! Lay not thy beastly paws upon me, fellow! FINCK. Beastly! I scorn the word.âSay it againâ ARNOLD. No moreâRelease himâKeep a guard without; I'll give the signal, if I want your aid. [Exeunt Banditti. You see I came prepar'd. My lord, your castle Is in our hands, and you are in our pow'r. Fear not we shall abuse it. But, my lord, Since you refuse me credit, you shall have A stronger witness. Did you know Count Walstein? BARON. What right hast thou to ask? ARNOLD. That of his son. BARON. Of Walsteinâof the man whose vengeful hate Had wrought my fall, had not his plans recoil'd On his own head, and driv'n him with disgrace To pass in some obscure recess that life His crimes had justly forfeited? ARNOLD. Of him, Of Walstein, whom you character too truly, Behold th' unhappy son. From Presburg driv'n, Here, in the neighb'ring forest, he took refuge, His anguish heighten'd to despair, his soul Fost'ring revenge against mankind and thee. Soon a congenial troop of wild banditti Obey'd him as their chief; but incomplete Remain'd the vengeance he had vow'd 'gainst thee, 'Till from his slumb'ring nurse he stole thy son. BARON. I know not what to thinkâToo well I knew He was my mortal foeâBut thou, thou had'st No cause to hate me. If thou knew'st the secret, How could'st thou trifle with a father's pangs, And doom me thus to years of hopeless anguish? ARNOLD. I was prepar'd, my lord, to meet your censure. Now grant me patience, while I state the cause That led me thus, against my better nature, Not to divulge it. On the couch of death My father first disclos'd to me the secret Of Herman's birth. His trembling hand was lock'd In mine, as thus he solemnly address'd me. âAs thou would'st 'scape a dying father's curse, âSwear that to Stolberg thou wilt ne'er reveal âTh' existence of his son; so shall my hate âSurvive me, so shall my revenge be full.â I shudder'd as he spoke, but I obey'd him. Too long my guilty vow have I fulfil'd; But now the hand of heav'n itself impels me To shield him from destruction, and save thee From the commission of a crime, from which Nature recoils. BARON. I know not how to doubt thee. RODOLPH. I'd have your lordship be upon your guard. The whole may be a history trumpt up Between these fellows, to impose on you. I would require some further evidence. BARON. Hear'st thou, sir, what he says? In such a case, Some proof, some token of identity May doubtless be produc'dâ AGATHA. Oh the good saints! The truth I see will out. The poor dear babyâ It breaks my heart to think on'tâwas stol'n from me, When I had left it playing in the grove; And as, in the first moment of my fright, I laid his loss to some wild rav'ning beast, I ne'er had courage to confess the truth. By the same token, on his wrist he bore A bloody arrow's mark. HERMAN (baring his arm). Behold it here. BARON. Come to my arms! Thou art indeed my son! HERMAN. Thus on my knees let me receive thy blessing! BARON. Thou hast it.âQuick! release him from these bondsâ Oh Ida! My lov'd child! IDA. My heart o'erflows With joy and transport; heav'n has heard my pray'r, And my whole soul expands with gratitude. BARON. My Albert! How can I repay thy suff'rings? HERMAN. Life has for me but one attractive treasure. A father will not chide his new-found son, If, at the moment when his heart beats high With exultation, he avow his love For her, who deign'd to grace with her pure favour An unknown, abject outcastâ BARON. Hear'st thou, Ida? What shall I say for thee? Answer him, girl. Whate'er thou say'st I'll ratifyâ RODOLPH. My lord, This is such singular behaviourâ BARON. Can't you be quiet? RODOLPH. To a man like meâ BARON. Let her go on, sir; you shall have your turn, I warrant me.âCome, dearest, speak. IDA. From him, Whom, from the moment when returning sense Reveal'd him as my brave deliverer, I felt entitled to the best return My heart could offer, can I now withhold The hand which thus his modest suit solicits? (To Herman) Take it, the sacred pledge of Ida's love. RODOLPH. Madam, I vowâMy lordâThis is beyond All bearingâin my presence to proclaim Affection for a banditâMadam, madamâ HERMAN. Keep off! and learn to govern thy discourse. RODOLPH. Thou talk to me, sir? HERMAN. Aye, my lord to thee. Nay, frown not, nor look big. If thou presum'st To speak one disrespectful syllable To yonder lady, not this noble presence Shall skreen thee from my vengeance. BARON. There it is nowâ I said my niece would never be thy bride. Matters are alter'd, Count; I've found a son, Who now must be sole heir of my possessions. That makes a little diff'rence. RODOLPH. An immense one. This is a very pleasant incident; (forcing a laugh) Upon my honour it diverts me vastly. You've pick'd up some acquaintances, who doubtless Will do great credit to your family party. I wish you heartily joy of each other, And am, with sentiments of due respect, The company's obedient humble servant. [Exit. BARON. Well, get thee goneâthou art not worth recalling. Sir Arnoldâlet me rather call thee Walsteinâ Count Walsteinâlook upon this roof as thine. As for your followersâ ARNOLD. From this hour, no more Hold I connection with them; but I crave, Whate'er be their offences, they may have Free pardon for them. I am bound in honour Not to abandon those, whom confidence In my good faith induc'd to follow me. BARON. Their pardon is secur'd. If they shall quit Their savage habits, and become good subjects, They shall find favour from me.âCome, my son, Come, Ida, dearer to my heart than ever! My cares are over, all my future days I dedicate to happiness and you! [Exeunt Omnes. THE END.</field>
